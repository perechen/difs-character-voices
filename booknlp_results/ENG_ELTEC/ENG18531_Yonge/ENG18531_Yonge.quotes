145	151	120	120	Both	557	' Good morning , Philip . '
152	177	120	120	Both	557	' Good morning , Laura . Good morning , Charles ; I am glad you are down stairs again ! How are you today ? '
178	186	120	120	Both	557	' No way remarkable , thank you , '
197	201	203	203	Laura	454	' You walked ? '
205	236	237	237	he	149	' Yes . Where 's my uncle ? I called at the post - office , and brought a letter for him . It has the Moorworth post - mark , '
243	248	250	250	Charles	149	' Where 's that ? '
252	266	250	250	Charles	149	' The post - town to Redclyffe ; Sir Guy Morville 's place . '
267	283	195	195	Charles	149	' That old Sir Guy ! What can he have to do with my father ? '
284	290	292	292	Philip	454	' Did you not know , '
294	309	292	292	Philip	454	' that my uncle is to be guardian to the boy — his grandson ? '
310	319	195	195	Charles	149	' Eh ? No , I did not ? '
320	323	325	325	Philip	454	' Yes , '
327	391	325	325	Philip	454	' when old Sir Guy made it an especial point that my father should take the guardianship , he only consented on condition that my uncle should be joined with him ; so now my uncle is alone in the trust , and I can not help thinking something must have happened at Redclyffe . It is certainly not Sir Guy 's writing . '
392	409	411	411	Charles	149	' It must wait , unless your curiosity will carry you out in search of papa , '
413	426	411	411	Charles	149	' he is somewhere about ; zealously supplying the place of Jenkins . '
427	432	434	434	Laura	454	' Really , Philip , '
436	453	434	434	Laura	454	' there is not telling how much good you have done him by convincing him of Jenkins '
479	493	411	411	Charles	149	' Philip smiled , and came to the table where she was drawing . '
498	501	503	503	she	560	' place ? '
511	521	503	503	she	560	' Stylehurst itself ! What is it taken from ? '
522	542	411	411	Charles	149	' From this pencil sketch of your sister 's , which I found in mamma 's scrap - book . '
543	571	411	411	Charles	149	' You are making it very like , only the spire is too slender , and that tree — can't you alter the foliage?—it is an ash . '
572	583	503	503	she	560	' Is it ? I took it for an elm . '
584	618	619	619	She	560	' And surely those trees in the foreground should be greener , to throw back the middle distance . That is the peak of South Moor exactly , if it looked further off . '
645	661	503	503	she	560	' Laura ! Are you there ? Open the door , and you will see . '
692	721	503	503	she	560	' Thank you ! Oh , is it you , Philip ? Oh , do n't take it . I must bring my own camellia to show Charlie . '
722	732	734	734	Charles	149	' You make the most of that one flower , '
736	743	745	745	she	560	' Only see how many buds ! '
752	821	745	745	she	560	' Is it not a perfect blossom , so pure a white , and so regular ! And I am so proud of having beaten mamma and all the gardeners , for not another will be out this fortnight ; and this is to go to the horticultural show . Sam would hardly trust me to bring it in , though it was my nursing , not his . '
822	827	829	829	Philip	454	' Now , Amy , '
839	859	829	829	Philip	454	' you must let me put it into the window for you . It is too heavy for you . '
860	866	868	868	Amabel	234	' Oh , take care , '
898	916	877	877	he	454	' O Amy , I am very sorry . What a pity ! How did it happen ? '
917	921	922	922	she	234	' Never mind , '
925	935	922	922	she	234	' it will last a long time in water . '
936	954	877	877	he	454	' It was very unlucky — I am very sorry — especially because of the horticultural show . '
955	963	965	965	Amy	210	' Make all your apologies to Sam , '
967	977	965	965	Amy	210	' his feelings will be more hurt than mine . '
1000	1022	877	877	he	454	' Her tone was gay ; but Charles , who saw her face in the glass , betrayed her by saying , '
1031	1032	1033	1033	I	0	' '
1040	1111	1033	1033	I	0	' quoted Amy ; with a merry laugh ; and before any more could be said , there entered a middle - aged gentleman , short and slight , with a fresh , weather - beaten good - natured face , grey whiskers , quick eyes , and a hasty , undecided air in look and movement . He greeted Philip heartily , and the letter was given to him . '
1145	1146	1192	1192	mamma	5168	' '
1155	1156	1162	1164	poor old man	563	' '
1166	1180	1162	1164	poor old man	563	' Then stepping to the door , he opened it , and called , '
1194	1277	1192	1192	mamma	5168	' The summons was obeyed by a tall , handsome lady , and behind her crept , with doubtful steps , as if she knew not how far to venture , a little girl of eleven , her turned up nose and shrewd face full of curiosity . She darted up to Amabel ; who , though she shook her head , and held up her finger , smiled and took the little girl 's hand , listening meanwhile to the announcement , '
1299	1300	1291	1293	Sir Guy Morville	150	' '
1323	1324	1325	1326	His grandson	5159	' '
1339	1494	1495	1495	Yours	570	' Holding it half a yard from his eyes , so that all could see a few lines of hasty , irregular writing , in a forcible hand , bearing marks of having been penned under great distress and agitation , he read aloud : — " Dear Mr. Edmonstone — My dear grandfather died at six this morning . He had an attack of apoplexy yesterday evening , and never spoke again , though for a short time he knew me . We hope he suffered little . Markham will make all arrangements . We propose that the funeral should take place on Tuesday ; I hope you will be able to come . I would write to my cousin , Philip Morville , if I knew his address ; but I depend on you for saying all that ought to be said . Excuse this illegible letter,—I hardly know what I write . '
1499	1503	1495	1495	Yours	570	' Guy Morville . ''
1504	1508	1510	1510	Philip	454	' Poor fellow ! '
1512	1523	1510	1510	Philip	454	' he writes with a great deal of proper feeling . '
1524	1536	1538	1539	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' How very sad for him to be left alone there ! '
1541	1547	1538	1539	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Very sad — very , '
1552	1577	1538	1539	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I must start off to him at once — yes , at once . Should you not say so , eh ! Philip ? '
1578	1615	1510	1510	Philip	454	' Certainly . I think I had better go with you . It would be the correct thing , and I should not like to fail in any token of respect for poor old Sir Guy . '
1616	1623	1625	1626	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Of course — of course , '
1628	1658	1625	1626	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' it would be the correct thing . I am sure he was always very civil to us , and you know you are next heir after this boy . '
1679	1720	1676	1676	Philip	454	' That is not worth a thought ; but since he and I are now the only representatives of the two branches of the house of Morville , it shall not be my fault if the enmity is not forgotten . '
1721	1731	1733	1733	Charles	156	' Buried in oblivion , would sound more magnanimous , '
1787	1801	1802	1802	she	277	' And at her mother 's question,—'Charlotte , what business have you here ? '
1825	1826	1818	1819	her mother	5185	' '
1832	1843	1830	1830	he	576	' asked Mr. Edmonstone , returning to the former subject . '
1859	1864	1844	1844	He	576	' answered Mrs. Edmonstone . '
1900	1901	1902	1902	He	576	' '
1912	1916	1902	1902	He	576	' said Philip , '

2055	2069	2070	2070	We	587	' interrupted Mr. Edmonstone , spreading out his hands in a deprecating manner . '
2128	2129	2130	2130	You	0	' '
2137	2141	2135	2135	yourself	0	' said Charles . '
2174	2184	2165	2165	I	0	' he proceeded , looking more important than troubled . '
2244	2245	2242	2242	Philip	454	' '
2255	2259	2253	2253	you	454	' replied Philip . '
2277	2292	2253	2253	you	454	' This arranged , Mr. Edmonstone hurried away , and Charles began by saying , '
2301	2302	2253	2253	you	454	' '
2308	2313	2253	2253	you	454	' answered his cousin ; '
2397	2398	2388	2388	you	600	' '
2405	2410	2388	2388	you	600	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , '
2481	2482	2476	2479	a sort of ogres	606	' '
2490	2494	2476	2479	a sort of ogres	606	' said Philip . '
2521	2522	2523	2524	Poor man	566	' '
2533	2538	2528	2528	he	566	' said Mrs. Edmonstone . '
2552	2556	2558	2558	he	566	' said Philip . '
2562	2563	2558	2558	he	566	' '
2575	2576	2558	2558	he	566	' '
2579	2583	2558	2558	he	566	' asked Laura . '
2796	2797	2798	2800	The poor wife	623	' '
2802	2808	2798	2800	The poor wife	623	' asked Amabel , shuddering . '
2821	2822	2809	2809	She	623	' '
2825	2829	2809	2809	She	623	' said Philip . '

2905	2906	2895	2896	Sir Guy	150	' '
2917	2921	2911	2911	he	150	' said Philip . '

3171	3172	3150	3151	my brother	578	' '
3175	3179	3198	3201	a lady who sung	651	' said Philip ; '

3344	3345	3319	3319	he	150	' '

3407	3411	3399	3399	he	150	' said Charles . '
3414	3419	3399	3399	he	150	' said Mrs. Edmonstone . '
3559	3560	3553	3553	himself	150	' '
3569	3573	3564	3567	a very striking person	670	' said Philip ; '
3661	3662	3663	3665	That poor boy	676	' '
3669	3674	3663	3665	That poor boy	676	' said Mrs. Edmonstone ; '
3687	3688	3680	3681	your uncle	678	' '
3694	3698	3680	3681	your uncle	678	' said Laura . '
3707	3711	3699	3699	He	676	' said Philip . '
3773	3774	3771	3771	Guy	150	' '
3779	3783	3771	3771	Guy	150	' asked Laura . '
3822	3823	3815	3815	his	680	' '
3832	3833	3828	3830	old Sir Guy	150	' '
3882	3883	3874	3874	he	150	' '
3895	3896	3897	3897	He	150	' '
3939	3940	3942	3942	you	686	' '
3950	3954	3942	3942	you	686	' asked Laura . '
3979	3980	3981	3981	He	150	' '
3987	3991	3983	3985	a fine fellow	687	' said Philip ; '
4069	4070	4073	4073	you	686	' '
4084	4088	4076	4076	he	150	' said Amy . '
4091	4096	4076	4076	he	150	' added her mother , '
4117	4118	4120	4120	I	0	' '
4124	4128	4120	4120	I	0	' resumed Philip , '
4289	4290	4272	4272	he	584	' '
4299	4305	4272	4272	he	584	' cried Charles , delighted . '
4376	4377	4372	4372	himself	166	' '
4381	4386	4378	4379	Poor boy	569	' said Mrs. Edmonstone . '
4392	4396	4378	4379	Poor boy	569	' said Charles . '
4440	4445	4446	4446	My	0	' Sir Guy answered , '
4450	4562	4446	4446	My	0	' and there was not another word . I saw Guy no more that day , and all the next he was quiet and subdued . But the most remarkable part of the story is to come . A couple of days afterwards , we were walking in the woods , when , at the sound of Guy 's whistle , we heard a flapping and rustling , and beheld , tumbling along , with their clipped wings , these two identical hawks , very glad to be caught . They drew themselves up proudly for him to stroke them , and their yellow eyes looked at him with positive affection . '
4563	4567	4569	4569	Amabel	234	' Pretty creatures ! '
4571	4582	4569	4569	Amabel	234	' That is a very nice end to the story . '
4583	4590	4592	4592	Philip	454	' It is not the end , '
4594	4649	4592	4592	Philip	454	' I was surprised to see Guy so sober , instead of going into one of his usual raptures . He took them home ; but the first thing I heard in the morning was , that he was gone to offer them to a farmer , to keep the birds from his fruit . '
4650	4660	4662	4662	Laura	454	' Did he do it of his own accord ? '
4664	4734	4662	4662	Laura	454	' That was just what I wanted to know ; but any hint about them brought such a cloud over his face that I thought it would be wanton to irritate him by questions . However , I must be going . Good bye , Amy , I hope your camellia will have another blossom before I come back . At least , I shall escape the horticultural meeting . '
4735	4739	4741	4741	Charles	156	' Good bye , '
4743	4781	4741	4741	Charles	156	' Put the feud in your pocket till you can bury it in old Sir Guy 's grave , unless you mean to fight it out with his grandson , which would be more romantic and exciting . '
4799	4814	4796	4796	Laura	454	' Charlie , I wish you would not let your spirits carry you away . '
4815	4827	4741	4741	Charles	156	' I wish I had anything else to carry me away ! '
4832	4835	4837	4838	his mother	612	' Yes , '
4845	4876	4877	4877	Charles	156	' Your high spirits are a blessing , but why misuse them ? If they are given to support you through pain and confinement , why make mischief with them ? '
4894	4897	4899	4900	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Now , '
4902	4914	4899	4900	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I must go and see after my poor little prisoner . '
4915	4918	4920	4920	Laura	454	' Ah ! '
4926	4955	4920	4920	Laura	454	' it was no kindness in you to encourage Charlotte to stay , Amy , when you know how often that inquisitive temper has got her into scrapes . '
4956	4961	4963	4963	Amy	210	' I suppose so , '
4967	4979	4963	4963	Amy	210	' but I had not the heart to send her away . '
4980	5000	4920	4920	Laura	454	' That is just what Philip says , that you only want bones and sinews in your character to — '
5001	5006	5008	5008	Charles	156	' Come , Laura , '
5010	5056	5008	5008	Charles	156	' I wo n't hear Philip 's criticisms of my sisters . I had rather she had no bones at all , than that they stuck out and ran into me . There are plenty of angles already in the world , without sharpening hers . '
5086	5091	5093	5093	he	156	' soft pinky cushions , '
5097	5105	5093	5093	he	156	' not meant for studying anatomy upon . '
5106	5116	5118	5118	Laura	454	' Ah ! you two spoil each other sadly , '
5128	5140	5142	5142	Charles	156	' And what do Philip and Laura do to each other ? '
5144	5152	5154	5154	Amabel	234	' Improve each other , I suppose , '
5167	5177	5179	5179	she	234	' I wish I was as sensible as Laura ! '
5187	5195	5197	5197	Charles	156	' Never was a more absurd wish , '
5210	5249	5197	5197	Charles	156	' unwish it forthwith . Where should I be without silly little Amy ? If everyone weighed my wit before laughing , I should not often be in disgrace for my high spirits , as they call them . '
5250	5259	5261	5261	Amy	210	' I am so little younger than Laura , '
5269	5272	5274	5274	Charles	156	' Folly , '
5276	5314	5274	5274	Charles	156	' you are quite wise enough for your age , while Laura is so prematurely wise , that I am in constant dread that nature will take her revenge by causing her to do something strikingly foolish ! '
5315	5318	5320	5320	Amy	210	' Nonsense ! '
5324	5330	5320	5320	Amy	210	' Laura do anything foolish ! '
5331	5337	5339	5339	Charles	156	' What I should enjoy , '
5341	5362	5339	5339	Charles	156	' would be to see her over head and ears in love with this hero , and Philip properly jealous . '
5363	5373	5320	5320	Amy	210	' How can you say such things , Charlie ? '
5374	5394	5320	5320	Amy	210	' Why ? was there ever a beauty who did not fall in love with her father 's ward ? '
5395	5415	5339	5339	Charles	156	' Yes ; but she ought to live alone with her very old father and horribly grim maiden aunt . '
5416	5429	5438	5438	he	156	' Very well , Amy , you shall be the maiden aunt . '
5463	5472	5474	5474	Laura	454	' If his guardian had a beautiful daughter , '
5482	5493	5495	5495	Charles	156	' Did you ever hear such barefaced fishing for compliments ? '
6081	6111	6077	6077	he	156	' It is striking six , so they must soon be here . I wish mamma would let me go down ; but I must wait till after dinner . '
6112	6132	6077	6077	he	156	' Then , Charlotte , as soon as you come in , hold up your hands , and exclaim , '
6137	6144	6077	6077	he	156	' There will be a compliment ! '
6145	6165	6077	6077	he	156	' No , Charlie ; I promised mamma and Laura that you should get me into no more scrapes . '
6166	6182	6077	6077	he	156	' Did you ? The next promise you make had better depend upon yourself alone . '
6183	6221	6077	6077	he	156	' But Amy said I must be quiet , because poor Sir Guy will be too sorrowful to like a racket ; and when Amy tells me to be quiet , I know that I must indeed . '
6222	6226	6228	6228	Charles	156	' Most true , '
6232	6242	6228	6228	Charles	156	' Do you think you shall like Sir Guy ? '
6243	6251	6253	6253	Charles	156	' I shall be able to determine , '
6257	6273	6253	6253	Charles	156	' when I have seen whether he brushes his hair to the right or left . '
6274	6282	6077	6077	he	156	' Philip brushes his to the left . '
6283	6297	6077	6077	he	156	' Then , undoubtedly , Sir Guy will brush his to the right . '
6298	6311	6077	6077	he	156	' Is there not some horrid story about those Morvilles of Redelyffe ? '
6315	6357	6077	6077	he	156	' I asked Laura , and she told me not to be curious , so I knew there was something in it ; and then I asked Amy , and she said it would be no pleasure to me to know . '
6358	6367	6228	6228	Charles	156	' Ah ! I would have you prepared . '
6368	6388	6077	6077	he	156	' Why , what is it ? Oh ! dear Charlie ! are you really going to tell me ? '
6389	6399	6077	6077	he	156	' Did you ever hear of a deadly feud ? '
6400	6448	6228	6228	Charles	156	' I have read of them in the history of Scotland . They went on hating and killing each other for ever . There was one man who made his enemy 's children eat out of a pig trough , and another who cut off his head — '
6449	6453	6077	6077	he	156	' His own ? '
6454	6480	6077	6077	he	156	' No , his enemy 's , and put it on the table , at breakfast , with a piece of bread in its mouth . '
6481	6509	6510	6510	Charlotte	277	' Very well ; whenever Sir Guy serves up Philip 's head at breakfast , with a piece of bread in his mouth , let me know . '
6514	6529	6510	6510	Charlotte	277	' Charles , what do you mean ? Such things do n't happen now . '
6530	6548	6077	6077	he	156	' Nevertheless , there is a deadly feud between the two branches of the house of Morville . '
6549	6556	6558	6558	Charlotte	277	' But it is very wrong , '
6563	6571	6558	6558	Charlotte	277	' Wrong ? Of course it is . '
6572	6588	6077	6077	he	156	' Philip wo nt do anything wrong . But how will they ever get on ? '
6589	6612	6077	6077	he	156	' Do n't you see ? It must be our serious endeavour to keep the peace , and prevent occasions of discord . '
6613	6621	6558	6558	Charlotte	277	' Do you think anything will happen ? '
6622	6630	6632	6632	Charles	156	' It is much to be apprehended , '
6673	6692	6666	6666	She	277	' Papa and Sir Guy are come , but not Philip ; I ca n't see him anywhere . '
6693	6708	6735	6735	him	747	' Ah ! you have not looked in Sir Guy 's great coat pocket . '
6709	6725	6735	6735	him	747	' I wish you would not plague me so ? You are not in earnest ? '
6761	6766	6767	6767	they	748	' He is come ! '
6774	6778	6780	6780	Laura	454	' Very gentlemanlike ! '
6782	6787	6789	6789	Amy	210	' Very pleasant looking , '
6791	6796	6789	6789	Amy	210	' Such fine eyes ! '
6797	6803	6805	6805	Laura	454	' And so much expression , '
6807	6810	6805	6805	Laura	454	' Oh ! '
6840	6846	6789	6789	Amy	210	' Here is poor Charles , '
6850	6867	6789	6789	Amy	210	' come in and see him ; get over the first introduction — eh , Guy ? '
6896	6906	6908	6909	his father	616	' Well , Charlie boy , how goes it ? '
6913	6934	6908	6909	his father	616	' Better , eh ? Sorry not to find you downstairs , but I have brought Guy to see you . '
6951	6978	6948	6948	he	156	' A fine chance for you , as I was telling him , to have a companion always at hand ; a fine chance?—eh , Charlie ? '
6979	6996	6998	6998	Charles	156	' I am not so unreasonable as to expect any one to be always at hand , '
7060	7072	7056	7057	Sir Guy	150	' O , Bustle ! Bustle ! I am very sorry , '
7145	7150	7152	7152	Charles	156	' O you beauty ! '
7154	7162	7152	7152	Charles	156	' Come here , you fine fellow . '
7181	7194	7196	7197	Sir Guy	150	' Ah ! I was afraid you would repent of your kindness , '
7202	7211	7199	7200	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Not at all , not at all ! '
7216	7228	7199	7200	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' mamma never objects to indoor pets , eh , Amy ? '
7235	7239	7241	7241	Pepper	170	' said Laura ; '
7243	7311	7241	7241	Pepper	170	' Amy , ashamed of her disposition to cry at the remembrance of the dear departed rough terrier , bent down to hide her glowing face , and held out her hand to the dog , which at last ventured to advance , still creeping with his body curved till his tail was foremost , looking imploringly at his master , as if to entreat his pardon . '
7321	7329	7330	7330	I	0	' inquired Sir Guy , of Charles . '
7341	7342	7337	7337	you	758	' '
7358	7451	7354	7354	you	758	' said Sir Guy ; and Bustle , resuming the deportment of a spirited and well - bred spaniel , no longer crouched and curled himself into the shape of a comma , but bounded , wagged his tail , thrust his nose into his master 's hand , and then proceeded to reconnoitre the rest of the company , paying especial attention to Charles , putting his fore paws on the sofa , and rearing himself up to contemplate him , with a grave , polite curiosity that was very diverting . '
7457	7461	7463	7463	you	759	' said Charles , '
7492	7493	7494	7494	I	0	' '
7507	7530	7494	7494	I	0	' said Laura ; and after a few more compliments , Bustle and his master followed Mr. Edmonstone out of the room . '
7541	7545	7494	7494	I	0	' murmured Charles . '
7595	7596	7584	7584	he	5164	' '
7601	7605	7584	7584	he	5164	' said Laura . '
7612	7613	7615	7615	he	5164	' '
7620	7626	7615	7615	he	5164	' said Amabel , consolingly . '
7634	7642	7627	7627	You	767	' said Charlotte , with great earnestness . '
7657	7661	7662	7662	I	0	' said Laura . '
7668	7684	7664	7664	you	0	' said her brother ; and she looked in doubt whether she ought to laugh . '
7694	7695	7688	7688	you	0	' '
7705	7709	7688	7688	you	0	' replied Charles . '
7712	7716	7688	7688	you	0	' said Laura , '

7778	7779	7757	7757	she	172	' '
7789	7837	7783	7783	she	172	' said Amabel . Laura looked as if she knew more , but at that moment both her father and mother entered , the former rubbing his hands , as he always did when much pleased , and sending his voice before him , as he exclaimed , '
7856	7857	7850	7852	a fine fellow	687	' '
7862	7866	7850	7852	a fine fellow	687	' said Charles . '
7918	7919	7920	7920	Hem	173	' '
7924	7942	7920	7920	Hem	173	' said Charles , shortly , for he hated answering kind inquiries , when out of humour . '
7975	7984	7966	7966	you	156	' said Mr. Edmonstone , disappointed and apologizing . '
7996	8000	7985	7985	I	0	' said Charles ; '
8011	8012	8001	8001	I	0	' '
8026	8039	8017	8017	I	0	' said poor Mr. Edmonstone , only half conscious of his offence ; '
8050	8096	8097	8097	You	156	' Worse and worse , for it was equivalent to openly telling Charles he was out of humour ; and seeing , as he did , his mother 's motive , he was still further annoyed when she hastily interposed a question about Sir Guy . '
8108	8113	8101	8101	them	776	' said Mr. Edmonstone . '
8178	8188	8191	8191	he	454	' Charles set up his eye - brows sarcastically . '
8197	8201	8191	8191	he	454	' inquired Laura . '
8245	8259	8260	8260	I	0	' Charles made an exaggerated gesture of astonishment , unseen by his father . '

8354	8450	8451	8451	Hum	174	' It was now time to go down to dinner ; and after Charles had made faces of weariness and disgust at all the viands proposed to him by his mother , almost imploring him to like them , and had at last ungraciously given her leave to send what he could not quite say he disliked , he was left to carry on his teazing of Charlotte , and his grumbling over the dinner , for about the space of an hour , when Amabel came back to him , and Charlotte went down . '
8453	8457	8451	8451	Hum	174	' he exclaimed . '

9227	9230	9231	9231	he	150	' Noble ! '
9234	9249	9231	9231	he	150	' and yet what a pity ! If my grandfather had but known it — '
9250	9259	9262	9263	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Ah ! I was convinced of that , '
9265	9326	9262	9263	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' and so I am sure was Philip himself ; but in fact he knew we should never have given our consent , so he acted quite by himself , wrote to Lord Thorndale , and never said a word , even to his sisters , till the thing was done . I never was more surprised in my life . '
9327	9341	9343	9344	Sir Guy	150	' One would almost envy him the opportunity of making such a sacrifice , '
9346	9353	9343	9344	Sir Guy	150	' yet one must lament it . '
9364	9369	9370	9370	I	0	' said Mrs. Edmonstone ; '

9490	9495	9486	9488	a practical man	832	' said Mr. Edmonstone ; '

9589	9597	9601	9601	him	829	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , in explanation . '
9608	9613	9598	9598	I	0	' said Sir Guy ; '
9629	9630	9615	9615	he	829	' '
9648	9649	9650	9650	Philip	454	' '
9658	9662	9652	9652	he	454	' interposed Charlotte . '
9673	9678	9663	9663	He	454	' continued Mr. Edmonstone . '
9859	9860	9848	9848	Maurice	181	' '
9864	9868	9848	9848	Maurice	181	' exclaimed Charlotte , '
9902	9903	9848	9848	Maurice	181	' '
9909	9914	9848	9848	Maurice	181	' said Mr. Edmonstone , '
9922	9945	9848	9848	Maurice	181	' Thereupon the family fell into a discussion of home affairs , and thought little more of their silent guest . Gray . '
9954	10192	9949	9949	I	0	' said Charles to himself , as he studied Sir Guy Morville , who sat by the table , with a book in his hand . He had the unformed look of a growing boy , and was so slender as to appear taller than he really was . He had an air of great activity ; and though he sat leaning back , there was no lounging in his attitude , and at the first summons , he roused up with an air of alert attention that recalled to mind the eager head of a listening greyhound . He had no pretension to be called handsome ; his eyes were his best feature ; they were very peculiar , of a light hazel , darker towards the outside of the iris , very brilliant , the whites tinted with blue , and the lashes uncommonly thick and black ; the eyebrows were also very dark , and of a sharply - defined , angular shape , but the hair was much lighter , loose , soft , and wavy ; the natural fairness of the complexion was shown by the whiteness of the upper part of the forehead , though the rest of the face , as well as the small taper hands , were tanned by sunshine and sea - breezes , into a fresh , hardy brown , glowing with read on the cheeks . '
10201	10207	10196	10196	I	0	' proceeded Charles 's thoughts . '
10265	10277	10278	10278	Plague	185	' He tried to read , but presently looked up again . '
10322	10705	10706	10706	You	855	' Mrs. Edmonstone came in , and , looking round , as if to find some occupation for her guest , at length devised setting him to play at chess with Charles . Charles gave her an amiable look , expressing that neither liked it ; but she was pretty well used to doing him good against his will , and trusted to its coming right in time . Charles was a capital chess - player , and seldom found any one who could play well enough to afford him much real sport , but he found Sir Guy more nearly a match than often fell to his lot ; it was a bold dashing game , that obliged him to be on his guard , and he was once so taken by surprise as to be absolutely check - mated . His ill humour evaporated , he was delighted to find an opponent worth playing with and thenceforth there were games almost every morning or evening , though Sir Guy seemed not to care much about them , except for the sake of pleasing him . When left to himself , Guy spent his time in reading or in walking about the lanes alone . He used to sit in the bay - window of the drawing - room with his book ; but sometimes , when they least expected it , the girls would find his quick eyes following them with an air of amused curiosity , as Amabel waited on Charles and her flowers , or Laura drew , wrote letters , and strove to keep down the piles of books and periodicals under which it seemed as if her brother might some day be stifled — a vain task , for he was sure to want immediately whatever she put out of his reach . Laura and Amabel both played and sung , the former remarkably well , and the first time they had any music after the arrival of Sir Guy , his look of delighted attention struck everyone . He ventured nearer , stood by the piano when they practised , and at last joined in with a few notes of so full and melodious a voice , that Laura turned round in surprise , exclaiming , '
10714	10718	10706	10706	You	855	' He coloured . '
10724	10728	10719	10719	I	0	' he said , '
10741	10742	10735	10735	I	0	' '
10745	10752	10753	10753	I	0	' said Laura , smiling incredulously . '
10761	10762	10753	10753	I	0	' '
10777	10948	10773	10773	us	857	' The sisters were again charmed and surprised , and Guy looked gratified , as people do at the discovery of a faculty which they are particularly glad to possess . It was the first time he appeared to brighten , and Laura and her mother agreed that it would do him good to have plenty of music , and to try to train that fine voice . He was beginning to interest them all greatly by his great helpfulness and kindness to Charles , as he learnt the sort of assistance he required , as well as by the silent grief that showed how much attached he must have been to his grandfather . On the first Sunday , Mrs. Edmonstone , coming into the drawing - room at about half - past five , found him sitting alone by the fire , his dog lying at his feet . As he started up , she asked if he had been here in the dark ever since church time ? '
10955	10995	10949	10949	I	0	' he answered with a sigh , long , deep , and irrepressible , and as she stirred the fire , the flame revealed to her the traces of tears . She longed to comfort him , and said — '
11006	11007	11061	11061	you	0	' '
11010	11014	11061	11061	you	0	' he said , '
11020	11026	11061	11061	you	0	' and there he paused . '

11058	11059	11042	11042	he	0	' '
11070	11087	11061	11061	you	0	' asked Mrs. Edmonstone , perceiving that it would be a relief to him to talk . '
11182	11191	11173	11173	Arnaud	186	' His voice became low with strong emotion . '
11198	11199	11193	11193	he	0	' '
11207	11213	11193	11193	he	0	' said Guy , eagerly . '
11253	11292	11236	11236	he	0	' The last words were almost inaudible from the gush of tears that he vainly struggled to repress , and he was turning away to hide them , when he saw that Mrs. Edmonstone 's were flowing fast . '
11303	11313	11317	11317	I	0	' said she as soon as she could speak . '
11320	11327	11317	11317	I	0	' And after a long silence — '
11380	11428	11362	11362	he	0	' He spoke in short half sentences of intense feeling , and Mrs. Edmonstone was much moved by such affection in one said to have been treated with an excess of strictness , much compassionating the lonely boy , who had lost every family tie in one . '
11440	11444	11445	11445	you	862	' said she , '
11459	11460	11445	11445	you	862	' '
11467	11471	11462	11462	I	0	' said Guy , '
11501	11502	11492	11492	I	0	' '
11513	11518	11506	11506	we	863	' said Mrs. Edmonstone . '

11555	11586	11549	11549	I	0	' She knew that nothing could have been more filial and affectionate than his conduct , and tried to say something of the kind , but he would not listen . '
11593	11597	11549	11549	I	0	' he said ; '
11626	11652	11609	11609	They	864	' A silence ensued , while Mrs. Edmonstone was trying to think of some consolation . Suddenly Guy looked up , and spoke eagerly : — '
11737	11750	11725	11725	you	862	' She held out her hand , and with tears answered , — '
11761	11762	11763	11763	You	862	' '
11802	11803	11790	11790	you	862	' '

11830	11875	11824	11824	you	862	' said Guy , and for the first time she saw the full beauty of his smile — a sort of sweetness and radiance of which eye and brow partook almost as much as the lips . It alone would have gained her heart . '
11887	11893	11882	11885	a kind of nephew	868	' she added , kindly . '
11906	11907	11894	11894	I	0	' '
11910	11917	11894	11894	I	0	' cried Guy , lighting up , '

11940	11949	11937	11937	I	0	' there she paused , and added , — '

12080	12117	12118	12118	Mamma	155	' The conversation was interrupted by the sound of Charles 's crutches slowly crossing the hall . Guy sprung to help him to his sofa , and then , without speaking , hurried up - stairs . '
12130	12134	12118	12118	Mamma	155	' exclaimed Charles . '
12146	12154	12155	12155	Hum	174	' said she , leaving the room . '
12157	12161	12155	12155	Hum	174	' soliloquized Charles . '
12273	12359	12360	12360	You	454	' The hawk 's eyes , as Charles called them , shone brighter from that day forth , and their owner began to show more interest in what passed around . Laura was much amused by a little conversation she held with him one day , when a party of their younger neighbours were laughing and talking nonsense round Charles 's sofa . He was sitting a little way off , in silence , and she took advantage of the loud laughing to say : — '
12368	12406	12360	12360	You	454	' And as he gave a quick glance of inquiry,—'Don't mind saying so . Philip and I often agree that it is a pity to spend so much time in laughing at nothing — at such nonsense . '
12407	12412	12360	12360	You	454	' Is it nonsense ? '
12413	12426	12360	12360	You	454	' Listen — no , do n't , it is too silly . '
12427	12441	12443	12443	Guy	150	' Nonsense must be an excellent thing if it makes people so happy , '
12447	12479	12443	12443	Guy	150	' Look at them ; they are like — not a picture — that has no life — but a dream — or , perhaps , a scene in a play . '
12480	12489	12360	12360	You	454	' Did you never see anything like it ? '
12490	12578	12360	12360	You	454	' Oh , no ! All the morning calls I ever saw were formal , every one stiff , and speaking by rote , or talking politics . How glad I used to be to get on horseback again ! But to see these — why , it is like the shepherd 's glimpse at the pixies!—as one reads a new book , or watches what one only half understands — a rook 's parliament , or a gathering of sea - fowl on the Shag Rock . '
12579	12585	12443	12443	Guy	150	' A rook 's parliament ? '
12586	12636	12360	12360	You	454	' The people at home call it a rook 's parliament when a whole cloud of rooks settle on some bare , wide common , and sit there as if they were consulting , not feeding , only stalking about with drooping wings , and solemn , black cloaks . '
12637	12645	12647	12647	Laura	454	' You have found a flattering simile , '
12649	12662	12647	12647	Laura	454	' as you know that rooks never open their mouths without cause . '
13033	13039	13023	13023	he	150	' Have you read anything ? '
13040	13053	13023	13023	he	150	' I am afraid I am very the ignorant of modern books . '
13054	13062	13064	13064	Laura	454	' Have you read the ancient ones ? '
13066	13075	13064	13064	Laura	454	' I 've had nothing else to read . '
13076	13084	13086	13086	Amabel	234	' Nothing to read but ancient books ! '
13096	13107	13109	13109	Guy	150	' Sanchoniathon , Manetho , Berosus , and Ocellus Lucanus ? '
13113	13118	13120	13120	Charles	156	' There , Amy , '
13122	13139	13120	13120	Charles	156	' if he has the Vicar among his ancient books , you need not pity him . '
13140	13146	13148	13148	Laura	454	' It is like Philip , '
13150	13176	13148	13148	Laura	454	' he was brought up on the old standard books , instead of his time being frittered away on the host of idle modern ones . '
13177	13190	13192	13192	Charles	190	' He was free to concentrate his attention on Sir Charles Grandison , '
13194	13202	13204	13204	Guy	150	' How could any one do so ? '
13206	13223	13204	13204	Guy	150	' How could any one have any sympathy with such a piece of self - satisfaction ? '
13224	13232	13234	13234	Charles	190	' Who could ? Eh , Laura ? '
13236	13242	13244	13244	Laura	454	' I never read it , '
13249	13258	13260	13260	Charles	190	' What is your opinion of perfect heroes ? '
13262	13267	13269	13269	Amy	210	' Here comes one , '
13323	13326	13328	13328	Philip	454	' True , '
13330	13367	13328	13328	Philip	454	' I have often been struck by finding how ignorant people are , even of Shakspeare ; and I believe the blame chiefly rests on the cheap rubbish in which Charlie is nearly walled up there . '
13368	13371	13373	13373	Charles	190	' Ay , '
13375	13410	13373	13373	Charles	190	' and who haunts that rubbish at the beginning of every month ? I suppose to act as pioneer , though whether any one but Laura heeds his warnings , remains to be proved . '
13411	13416	13418	13418	Philip	454	' Laura does heed ? '
13423	13492	13418	13418	Philip	454	' I made her read me the part of Dombey that hurts women 's feelings most , just to see if she would go on — the part about little Paul — and I declare , I shall think the worse of her ever after — she was so stony - hearted , that to this day , she does not know whether he is dead or alive . '
13493	13509	13511	13511	Laura	454	' I ca n't quite say I do n't know whether he lived or died , '
13513	13547	13511	13511	Laura	454	' for I found Amy in a state that alarmed me , crying in the green - house , and I was very glad to find it was nothing worse than little Paul . '
13548	13557	13559	13559	Amy	210	' I wish you would have read it , '
13571	13572	13567	13567	she	892	' '
13578	13582	13576	13576	Amy	210	' said Charles . '
13594	13595	13576	13576	Amy	210	' '
13604	13608	13596	13596	Philip	454	' said Amy . '
13611	13615	13576	13576	Amy	210	' said Philip ; '
13645	13646	13576	13576	Amy	210	' '
13649	13653	13576	13576	Amy	210	' said Charles , '
13666	13667	13657	13657	Laura	454	' '
13676	13677	13657	13657	Laura	454	' '
13681	13685	13679	13679	I	0	' said Guy . '
13697	13701	13657	13657	Laura	454	' said Philip ; '
13734	13735	13726	13726	I	0	' '
13738	13754	13726	13726	I	0	' said Guy , abruptly , and his dark eyebrows contracted . Philip went on . '
13791	13801	13789	13789	Laura	454	' Laura fetched it ; Guy , with a constrained '
13805	13840	13803	13803	you	0	' was going to take it up , rather as if he was putting a force upon himself , when Philip more quickly took the first volume , and eagerly turned over the pages — '
13847	13851	13786	13786	I	0	' he said , '
13857	14062	14063	14063	I	0	' It was soon produced ; and Philip , finding the beautiful history of Fra Cristoforo , began to translate it fluently , and with an admirable choice of language that silenced Charles 's attempts to interrupt and criticise . Soon Guy , who had at first lent only reluctant attention , was entirely absorbed , his eyebrows relaxed , a look of earnest interest succeeded , his countenance softened , and when Fra Cristoforo humbled himself , exchanged forgiveness , and received il pane del perdono , tears hung on his eye - lashes . The chapter was finished , and , with a smothered exclamation of admiration , he joined the others in begging Philip to proceed . The story thus read was very unlike what it had been to Laura and Amy when they puzzled it out as an Italian lesson , or to Charles , when he carelessly tossed over the translation in search of Don Abbondio 's humours ; and thus between reading and conversation , the morning passed very agreeably . At luncheon , Mr. Edmonstone asked Philip to come and spend a day or two at Hollywell , and he accepted the invitation for the next week . '
14079	14080	14066	14066	Thorndale	180	' '
14087	14092	14066	14066	Thorndale	180	' said Mr. Edmonstone , '
14115	14116	14098	14098	We	896	' '
14120	14124	14118	14118	you	0	' said Philip ; '
14135	14143	14118	14118	you	0	' laying a particular stress on the word '
14147	14164	14118	14118	you	0	' and looking at his aunt . At that moment the butler came in , saying , '
14180	14181	14182	14182	Deloraine	198	' '
14185	14192	14182	14182	Deloraine	198	' cried Guy , springing up . '
14195	14196	14201	14201	sir	899	' '
14203	14227	14201	14201	sir	899	' Guy darted out , Mr. Edmonstone following . In another instant , however , Guy put his head into the room again . '
14247	14320	14241	14241	you	159	' Off he rushed , and the others were just in time to see the cordial look of honest gladness with which William , the groom , received his young master 's greeting , and the delighted recognition between Guy , Bustle , and Deloraine . Guy had no attention for anything else till he had heard how they had prospered on the journey ; and then he turned to claim his friends '
14441	14452	14454	14454	he	454	' So I perceive you have dropped the title already , '
14459	14462	14464	14465	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Yes , '
14472	14516	14464	14465	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' it seemed to give him pain , by reminding him of his loss , and he was so strange and forlorn just at first , that we were glad to do what we could to make him feel himself more at home . '
14517	14526	14464	14465	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Then you get on pretty well now ? '
14537	14538	14539	14539	He	454	' '
14544	14548	14549	14549	He	454	' said Charlotte . '
14554	14558	14549	14549	He	454	' said Amabel . '
14565	14570	14559	14559	He	454	' said Mrs. Edmonstone . '
14576	14586	14559	14559	He	454	' said Laura . Then it all began again . '
14593	14597	14587	14587	He	454	' said Amy . '
14605	14609	14610	14610	He	454	' said Charlotte . '
14617	14632	14610	14610	He	454	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , going into the drawing - room to her son . '
14647	14651	14652	14652	His	454	' said Amabel . '
14660	14664	14665	14665	Philip	454	' said Laura . '
14667	14673	14665	14665	Philip	454	' said Charlotte , earnestly , '
14682	14683	14674	14674	you	454	' '
14690	14696	14686	14688	impertinent little puss	912	' said Philip , smiling , '
14704	14705	14706	14706	I	0	' '
14713	14719	14706	14706	I	0	' said Charlotte , impressively . '
14720	14725	14727	14727	Amy	210	' Is it hard , '
14729	14743	14727	14727	Amy	210	' But , oh Philip ! you could not help liking his singing . '
14744	14753	14755	14755	Laura	454	' I never heard such a splendid voice , '
14757	14788	14755	14755	Laura	454	' so clear and powerful , and yet so wonderfully sweet in the low soft notes . And a very fine ear : he has a real talent for music . '
14789	14797	14799	14799	Philip	454	' Ah ! inherited , poor fellow , '
14803	14811	14813	14813	Amy	210	' Do you pity him for it ? '
14817	14822	14824	14824	Philip	454	' Do you forget ? '
14826	14851	14824	14824	Philip	454	' I would not advise you to make much of this talent in public ; it is too much a badge of his descent . '
14852	14859	14861	14861	Amy	210	' Mamma did not think so , '
14863	14956	14861	14861	Amy	210	' She thought it a pity he should not learn regularly , with such a talent ; so the other day , when Mr. Radford was giving us a lesson , she asked Guy just to sing up and down the scale . I never saw anything so funny as old Mr. Radford 's surprise , it was almost like the music - lesson in La Figlia del Reggimento ; he started and looked at Guy , and seemed in a perfect transport , and now Guy is to take regular lessons . '
14957	14960	14970	14970	Laura	454	' Indeed . '
14961	14968	14970	14970	Laura	454	' But do you really mean , '
14972	14999	14970	14970	Laura	454	' that if your mother had been a musician 's daughter , and you had inherited her talent , that you would be ashamed of it . '
15000	15005	15007	15007	Philip	454	' Indeed , Laura , '
15013	15050	15007	15007	Philip	454	' I am equally far from guessing what I should do if my mother had been anything but what she was , as from guessing what I should do if I had a talent for music . '
15123	15135	15136	15136	she	159	' I am sure there is much to like in him , '
15139	15170	15136	15136	she	159	' There is , but is it the highest praise to say there is much to like ? People are not so cautious when they accept a man in toto . '
15171	15178	15179	15179	Philip	454	' Then , do you not ? '
15184	15194	15179	15179	Philip	454	' Do you think him a lion 's whelp ? '
15195	15283	15136	15136	she	159	' I am afraid I saw the lion just now in his flashing eyes and contracted brow . There is an impatience of advice , a vehemence of manner that I can hardly deem satisfactory . I do not speak from prejudice , for I think highly of his candour , warmth of heart , and desire to do right ; but from all I have seen , I should not venture as yet to place much dependence on his steadiness of character or command of temper . '
15284	15313	15136	15136	she	159	' He seems to have been very fond of his grandfather , in spite of his severity . He is but just beginning to brighten up a little . '
15314	15390	15179	15179	Philip	454	' Yes ; his disposition is very affectionate,—almost a misfortune to one so isolated from family ties . He showed remarkably well at Redclyffe , the other day ; boyish of course , and without much self - command , but very amiably . It is very well for him that he is removed from thence , for all the people idolize him to such a degree that they could not fail to spoil him . '
15391	15403	15136	15136	she	159	' It would be a great pity if he went wrong . '
15404	15494	15136	15136	she	159	' Great , for he has many admirable qualities , but still they are just what persons are too apt to fancy compensation for faults . I never heard that any of his family , except perhaps that unhappy old Hugh , were deficient in frankness and generosity , and therefore these do not satisfy me . Observe , I am not condemning him ; I wish to be perfectly just ; all I say is , that I do not trust him till I have seen him tried . '
15592	15601	15570	15570	She	917	' What are you thinking of , Philip ? '
15602	15634	15570	15570	She	917	' Of Locksley Hall . There is nonsense , there is affectation in that , Laura ; there is scarcely poetry , but there is power , for there is truth . '
15635	15647	15570	15570	She	917	' Of Locksley Hall ! I thought you were at Stylehurst . '
15648	15660	15570	15570	She	917	' So I was , but the one brings the other . '
15661	15682	15570	15570	She	917	' I supposee you went to Stylehurst while you were at St. Mildred 's . Did Margaret take you there ? '
15683	15713	15570	15570	She	917	' Margaret ? Not she ; she is too much engaged with her book - club , and her soirées , and her societies of every sort and kind . '
15714	15724	15570	15570	She	917	' How did you get on with the Doctor ? '
15725	15752	15570	15570	She	917	' I saw as little of him as I could , and was still more convinced that he does not know what conversation is . Hem ! '
15759	15836	15753	15753	Philip	454	' No ; the only thing to be done at St. Mildred 's , is to walk across the moors to Stylehurst . It is a strange thing to leave that tumult of gossip , and novelty , and hardness , and to enter on that quiet autumnal old world , with the yellow leaves floating silently down , just as they used to do , and the atmosphere of stillness round the green church yard . '
15837	15840	15842	15842	Laura	454	' Gossip ! '
15844	15850	15842	15842	Laura	454	' Surely not with Margaret ? '
15851	15867	15753	15753	Philip	454	' Literary scientific gossip is worse than gossip in a primary sense , without pretension . '
15868	15887	15753	15753	Philip	454	' I am glad you had Stylehurst to go to . How was the old sexton 's wife ? '
15888	15902	15842	15842	Laura	454	' Very well ; trotting about on her pattens as merrily as ever . '
15903	15911	15753	15753	Philip	454	' Did you go into the garden ? '
15912	15953	15753	15753	Philip	454	' Yes ; Fanny 's ivy has entirely covered the south wall , and the acacia is so tall and spreading , that I longed to have the pruning of it . Old Will keeps everything in its former state . '
15988	15994	15996	15996	Guy	150	' How glad I am ! '
16004	16007	16009	16009	Charles	156	' Wherefore ? '
16011	16039	16009	16009	Charles	156	' I thought I was too late , and I am very glad to find no one arrived , and Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone not come down . '
16040	16047	15996	15996	Guy	150	' But where have you been ? '
16048	16078	16009	16009	Charles	156	' I lost my way on the top of the down ; I fancied some one told me there was a view of the sea to be had there . '
16079	16092	16093	16093	Guy	150	' And ca n't you exist without a view of the sea ? '
16096	16130	16093	16093	Guy	150	' Everything looks so dull — it is as if the view was dead or imprisoned — walled up with wood and hill , and wanting that living ripple , heaving and struggling . '
16131	16137	16139	16139	Laura	454	' And your fine rocks , '
16141	16206	16139	16139	Laura	454	' I wish you could see the Shag - stone . A great island mass , sloping on one side , precipitous , on the other , with the spray dashing on it . If you see it from ever so far off , there is still that white foam coming and going — a glancing speck , like the light in an eye . '
16207	16213	16093	16093	Guy	150	' Hark ! a carriage . '
16214	16225	16227	16227	Charles	156	' The young man and the young man 's companion , '
16229	16234	16236	16236	Laura	454	' How can you ? '
16238	16249	16236	16236	Laura	454	' What would any one suppose Mr. Thorndale to be ? '
16250	16256	16258	16258	Charles	156	' Not Philip 's valet , '
16260	16291	16258	16258	Charles	156	' if it is true that no man is a hero to his valley - de - sham ; whereas , what is not Philip to the Honourable James Thorndale ? '
16292	16303	16305	16305	Amy	210	' Philip , Alexander , and Bucephalus into the bargain , '
16421	16424	16426	16426	Philip	454	' Encore ? '
16438	16443	16445	16445	Laura	454	' Unfortunately , yes , '
16450	16459	16461	16461	Philip	454	' One of my uncle 's family parties , '
16463	16495	16461	16461	Philip	454	' I wish I had not brought Thorndale . Laura , what is to be done to prevent the tittering that always takes place when Amy and those Harpers are together ? '
16496	16500	16502	16502	Laura	454	' Some game ? '
16822	16824	16834	16834	him	954	' Papa '
16890	16893	16882	16883	other people	959	' Papa , '
17154	17222	17224	17224	you	209	' guest , having only been introduced to him after church on Sunday . The pleasure on which Charles chiefly reckoned for that evening was the talking him over with her when the ladies came in from the dining room . The Miss Harpers , with his sisters , gathered round the piano , and Mrs. Edmonstone satat Charles 's feet , while Mary knitted and talked . '

17635	17659	17632	17633	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' the chief of his time was spent in wandering in the woods or on the beach , watching them and their ways . '
17660	17672	17674	17674	Charles	156	' I fairly dreamt of that Elysium of his last night , '
17676	17707	17708	17708	Charlotte	277	' a swamp half frozen on a winter 's night , full of wild ducks . Here , Charlotte , come and tell Mary the roll of Guy 's pets . '
17711	17770	17708	17708	Charlotte	277	' There was the seagull , and the hedgehog , and the fox , and the badger , and the jay , and the monkey , that he bought because it was dying , and cured it , only it died the next winter , and a toad , and a raven , and a squirrel , and — '
17771	17778	17632	17633	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' That will do , Charlotte . '
17779	17851	17708	17708	Charlotte	277	' Oh ! but Mary has not heard the names of all his dogs . And , Mary , he has cured Bustle of hunting my Puss . We held them up to each other , and Puss hissed horribly , but Bustle did not mind it a bit ; and the other day , when Charles tried to set him at her , he would not take the least notice . '
17852	17857	17859	17859	Charles	156	' Now , Charlotte , '
17871	17881	17859	17859	Charles	156	' have the goodness to return to your friends . '
17974	17979	17981	17981	Amy	210	' Some so characteristic , '
17983	17995	17981	17981	Amy	210	' such as Maurice 's definition of happiness,—a row at Dublin . '
17996	18004	18006	18006	Mary	208	' Some were very deep , though , '
18008	18028	18006	18006	Mary	208	' if it is not treason , I should like to make out whose that other was of happiness . '
18029	18034	18036	18036	Amy	210	' You mean this , '
18038	18051	18036	18036	Amy	210	'' Gleams from a brighter world , too soon eclipsed or forfeited . '

18219	18294	18208	18208	he	150	' was Philip 's sedate answer ; and he turned away to say some last words to Mr. Thorndale . The Rosses were the last to depart , Mary in cloak and clogs , while Mr. Edmonstone lamented that it was in vain to offer the carriage ; and Mary laughed , and thanked , and said the walk home with Papa was the greatest of treats in the frost and star - light . '
18311	18319	18299	18299	you	996	' were her last words to Laura . '
18324	18334	18322	18322	Guy	150	' said Charlotte , how do you like it ? '
18335	18346	18297	18297	I	0	' Very much , indeed . It was very pleasant . '
18347	18356	18358	18358	Laura	454	' You are getting into the fairy ring , '
18362	18365	18366	18366	he	150	' Ay , '
18372	18390	18392	18392	he	150	' but it does not turn to tinsel . Would it if I saw more of it ? '
18398	18410	18411	18411	she	159	' It would be no compliment to ourselves to say so , '
18414	18425	18427	18427	he	150	' I suppose tinsel or gold depends on the using , '
18431	18465	18427	18427	he	150	' there are some lumps of solid gold among those papers , I am sure , one , in particular , about a trifle . May I see that again — I mean — '
18474	18519	18427	18427	he	150	' said Amy , turning over the definitions again with him , and laughing at some of the most amusing ; while , in the meantime , Philip went to help Laura , who was putting some books away in the ante - room . '
18524	18528	18522	18522	Laura	454	' he said , '
18543	18544	18537	18537	he	150	' '

18645	18748	18601	18601	Mamma	155	' The frost turned to rain the next morning , and the torrents streamed against the window , seeming to have a kind of attraction for Philip and Guy , who stood watching them . Guy wondered if the floods would be out at Redclyffe ; and his cousins were interested by his description of the sudden , angry rush of the mountain streams , eddying fiercely along , bearing with them tree and rock ; while the valleys became lakes , and the little mounds islets ; and the trees looked strangely out of proportion when only their branches were visible . '
18758	18762	18601	18601	Mamma	155	' said he . '

19327	19337	19339	19339	Charles	156	' In the language of the great Mr. Toots , '
19341	19350	19292	19292	Markham	157	' I am afraid you got very wet . '
19351	19359	19361	19361	Amy	210	' Were you the worse for it ? '
19363	19423	19361	19361	Amy	210	' Not in the least . I was so glad to hear it was Holt 's ! for you must know that I had behaved very ill to Farmer Holt . I had been very angry at his beating our old hound for , as he thought , worrying his sheep ; not that Dart ever did , though . '
19424	19431	19292	19292	Markham	157	' And was the ram saved ? '
19432	19448	19361	19361	Amy	210	' Yes , and next time I saw it , it nearly knocked me down . '
19449	19456	19458	19458	Philip	454	' Would you do it again ? '
19460	19466	19458	19458	Philip	454	' I do n't know . '
19467	19479	19481	19481	Charles	156	' I hope you had a medal from the Humane Society , '
19483	19493	19481	19481	Charles	156	' That would have been more proper for Triton . '
19494	19502	19504	19504	Charles	156	' Yours should have been an ovation , '
19556	19568	19547	19547	she	1015	' You quite impressed Guy with your translation of Fra Cristoforo . '
19569	19580	19582	19582	Guy	150	' Indeed I must thank you for recommending the book , '
19584	19590	19547	19547	she	1015	' how beautiful it is . '
19591	19600	19602	19602	Philip	454	' I am glad you entered into it , '
19604	19616	19602	19602	Philip	454	' it has every quality that a fiction ought to have . '
19617	19631	19547	19547	she	1015	' I never read anything equal to the repentance of the nameless man . '
19632	19639	19641	19641	Philip	454	' Is he your favourite character ? '
19648	19680	19641	19641	Philip	454	' O no — of course not — though he is so grand that one thinks most about him , but no one can be cared about as much as Lucia . '
19681	19698	19700	19700	Philip	454	' Lucia ! She never struck me as more than a well - painted peasant girl , '
19702	19705	19707	19707	Guy	150	' Oh ! '
19718	19761	19715	19715	he	150	' She pretends to no more than she is , but she shows the beauty of goodness in itself in a — a — wonderful way . And think of the power of those words of hers over that gloomy desperate man . '
19762	19770	19772	19772	Philip	454	' Your sympathy with the Innominato again , '
19805	19813	19815	19815	Philip	454	' I brought this book on purpose , '
19817	19841	19815	19815	Philip	454	' I wished to read you a description of that print from Raffaelle — you know it — the Madonna di San Sisto . '
19842	19851	19853	19853	Amy	210	' The one you brought to show us ? '
19855	19862	19853	19853	Amy	210	' with the two little angels ? '
19863	19871	19873	19873	he	454	' Yes , here is the description , '
19878	20044	19873	19873	he	454	' Dwell on the form of the Child , more than human in grandeur , seated on the arms of the Blessed Virgin as on an august throne . Note the tokens of divine grace , His ardent eyes , what a spirit , what a countenance is his ; yet His very resemblance to His mother denotes sufficiently that He is of us and takes care for us . Beneath are two figures adoring , each in their own manner . On one side is a pontiff , on the other a virgin , each a most sweet and solemn example , the one of aged , the other of maidenly piety and reverence . Between , are two winged boys , evidently presenting a wonderful pattern of childlike piety . Their eyes , indeed , are not turned towards the Virgin , but , both in face and gesture , they show how careless of themselves they are in the presence of God . '
20178	20193	20175	20175	he	156	' Latin ! I thought you were translating . Is it your own property ? '
20194	20197	20175	20175	he	156	' Yes . '
20198	20218	20175	20175	he	156	' Is it very tough ? I would read it , if any one would read it with me . '
20219	20225	20227	20227	Guy	150	' Do you mean me ? '
20229	20247	20175	20175	he	156	' I should like it very much , but you have seen how little Latin I know . '
20248	20255	20257	20257	Charles	156	' That is the very thing , '
20259	20297	20257	20257	Charles	156	' that Ovis of yours was music ; I would have made you a Knight of the Golden Fleece on the spot . Tutors I could get by shoals , but a fellow - dunce is inestimable . '
20298	20306	20308	20308	Guy	150	' It is a bargain , then , '
20310	20325	20308	20308	Guy	150	' if Philip has done with the book and will lend it to us . '
20372	20434	20360	20360	he	156	' Nothing for it but billiards . People might say it was nonsense to have a billiard - table in such a house , but for his part he found there was no getting through a wet day without them . Philip must beat him as usual , and Guy might have one of the young ladies to make a fourth . '
20435	20439	20441	20441	Guy	150	' Thank you , '
20443	20450	20441	20441	Guy	150	' but I do n't play . '
20451	20485	20360	20360	he	156	' Not play — eh ? Well , we will teach you in the spinning of a ball , and I 'll have my little Amy to help me against you and Philip . '
20486	20492	20494	20494	Guy	150	' No , thank you , '
20498	20505	20494	20494	Guy	150	' I am under a promise . '
20506	20542	20360	20360	he	156	' Ha ! Eh ? What ? Your grandfather ? He could see no harm in such play as this . For nothing , you understand . You did not suppose I meant anything else ? '
20543	20551	20554	20554	Guy	150	' O no , of course not , '
20556	20583	20554	20554	Guy	150	' but it is impossible for me to play , thank you . I have promised never even to look on at a game at billiards . '
20584	20596	20601	20601	himself	156	' Ah , poor man , he had too much reason , '
20637	20645	20634	20634	he	150	' Do n't let me prevent you . '
20667	20675	20677	20677	Charlotte	277	' O , I am so glad ! '
20695	20730	20677	20677	Charlotte	277	' Now you will never go to those stupid billiards , but I shall have you always , every rainy day . Come and have a real good game at ball on the stairs . '
21016	21020	21022	21022	he	454	' Redclyffe temper , '
21037	21046	21048	21048	Charles	156	' What have you been doing to him ? '
21050	21195	21048	21048	Charles	156	' Nothing . At least nothing worthy of such ire . I only entered on the subject of his Oxford life , and advised him to prepare for it , for his education has as yet been a mere farce . He used to go two or three days in the week to one Potts , a self - educated genius — a sort of superior writing - master at the Moorworth commercial school . Of course , though it is no fault of his , poor fellow , he is hardly up to the fifth form , and he must make the most of his time , if he is not to be plucked . I set all this before him as gently as I could , for I knew with whom I had to deal , yet you see how it is , '
21196	21202	21204	21204	Charles	156	' What did he say ? '
21206	21266	21204	21204	Charles	156	' He said nothing , so far I give him credit ; but he strode on furiously for the last half mile , and this explosion is the finale . I am very sorry for him , poor boy ; I beg no further notice may be taken of it . Do n't you want an arm , Charlie ? '
21267	21273	21275	21275	Charles	156	' No , thank you , '
21282	21295	21297	21297	Philip	454	' You had better . It really is too much for Amy , '
21320	21328	21329	21329	he	156	' Like the camellia , I suppose , '
21426	21430	21438	21438	her	159	' Come in , '
21453	21458	21459	21459	he	150	' I am come , '
21462	21502	21459	21459	he	150	' to ask pardon for the disturbance I made just now . I was so foolish as to be irritated at Philip 's manner , when he was giving me some good advice , and I am very sorry . '
21503	21511	21512	21512	she	159	' What has happened to your lip ? '
21522	21565	21515	21515	He	150	' Is it bleeding still ? It is a trick of mine to bite my lip when I am vexed . It seems to help to keep down words . There ! I have given myself a mark of this hateful outbreak . '
21584	21592	21593	21593	she	159	' You have only failed in part , '
21596	21606	21593	21593	she	159	' It was a victory to keep down words . '
21607	21614	21616	21616	Guy	150	' The feeling is the thing , '
21618	21629	21616	21616	Guy	150	' besides , I showed it plainly enough without speaking . '
21630	21645	21647	21648	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' It is not easy to take advice from one so little your elder , '
21668	21691	21692	21692	he	150	' but he spoke with an effort,—'I am obliged to him . It was — no , I wo n't say what , '
21710	21810	21692	21692	he	150	' Yes , but I will , and then I shall make myself thoroughly ashamed . It was his veiled assumption of superiority , his contempt for all I have been taught . Just as if he had not every right to despise me , with his talent and scholarship , after such egregious mistakes as I had made in the morning . I gave him little reason to think highly of my attainments ; but let him slight me as much as he pleases , he must not slight those who taught me . It was not Mr. Potts '
21835	21840	21841	21841	she	159	' You must remember , '
21844	21879	21841	21841	she	159	' that in the eyes of a man brought up at a public school , nothing compensates for the want of the regular classical education . I have no doubt it was very provoking . '
21880	21892	21894	21894	Guy	150	' I do n't want to be excused , thank you , '
21896	21936	21894	21894	Guy	150	' Oh ! I am grieved ; for I thought the worst of my temper had been subdued . After all that has passed — all I felt — I thought it impossible . Is there no hope for — '
21956	21975	21953	21953	he	150	' It is encroaching too much on your kindness to come here and trouble you with my confessions . '
21976	21983	21985	21985	she	159	' No , no , indeed , '
21989	22049	21985	21985	she	159	' Remember how we agreed that you should come to me like one of my own children . And , indeed , I do not see why you need grieve in this despairing way , for you almost overcame the fit of anger ; and perhaps you were off your guard because the trial came in an unexpected way ? '
22050	22057	22058	22058	he	150	' It did , it did , '
22063	22105	22107	22107	he	150	' I do n't mind being told point blank that I am a dunce , but that Mr. Potts — nay , by implication — my grandfather should be set at nought in that cool — But here I am again ! '
22118	22137	22107	22107	he	150	' he did not mean that , of course . I have no one to blame but myself . '
22138	22143	22145	22146	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I am sure , '
22148	22167	22145	22146	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' that if you always treat your failings in this way , you must subdue them at last . '
22168	22181	22183	22183	Guy	150	' It is all failing , and resolving , and failing again ! '
22185	22203	22183	22183	Guy	150	' Yes , but the failures become slighter and less frequent , and the end is victory . '
22204	22209	22211	22211	Guy	150	' The end victory ! '
22226	22238	22240	22241	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Yes , to all who persevere and seek for help , '

22390	22439	22386	22386	he	150	' I begin to think the world must be more docile than I have been disposed to give it credit for . How a certain cousin of ours has escaped numerous delicate hints to mind his own business is to me one of the wonders of the world . '
22440	22452	22454	22454	Guy	150	' No one better deserves that his advice should be followed , '
22460	22467	22469	22469	Charles	156	' An additional reason against it , '
22471	22497	22469	22469	Charles	156	' Plague on that bell ! I meant to have broken through your formalities and had a candid opinion of Don Philip before it rang . '
22498	22519	22520	22520	Charles	156	' Then I am glad of it ; I could hardly have given you a candid opinion just at present . '
23118	23125	23126	23126	Charlotte	277	' Ten Thousand a - Year . '
23291	23296	23298	23298	he	150	' Well , Charlotte ? '
23318	23335	23304	23304	his	150	' Guy — Guy — Oh ! I beg your pardon , but I wanted to — '
23336	23341	23343	23343	he	150	' Well , what ? '
23347	23374	23343	23343	he	150	' I wanted to make sure that you are not angry with Philip . You do n't mean to keep up the feud , do you ? '
23375	23380	23382	23382	Guy	150	' Feud?—I hope not , '
23395	23404	23382	23382	Guy	150	' I am very much obliged to him . '
23405	23410	23412	23412	Charlotte	277	' Are you really ? '
23422	23431	23414	23414	her	277	' I thought he had been scolding you . '
23455	23461	23463	23463	Charlotte	277	' Not scolding , then ? '
23465	23485	23463	23463	Charlotte	277	' You are too nearly grown up for that , but telling you to learn , and being tiresome . '
23486	23498	23500	23500	Guy	150	' I was so foolish as to be provoked at first , '
23502	23522	23500	23500	Guy	150	' but I hope I have thought better of it , and I am going to act upon it . '
23619	23625	23589	23589	Philip	454	' Madonna di San Sisto , '
23812	23815	23817	23817	Guy	150	' Yes , '
23819	23837	23817	23817	Guy	150	' I am to begin to - morrow , and go to him every Monday and Thursday . '
23838	23843	23789	23790	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' That is prompt . '
23844	23881	23883	23883	he	150	' Ah ! I have no time to lose ; besides , I have been leading too smooth a life with you . I want something unpleasant to keep me in order . Something famously horrid , '
23907	23917	23919	23920	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' You think you live too smoothly at Hollywell , '
23942	23977	23927	23927	her	159	' Yes . Happy , thoughtless , vehement ; that is what your kindness makes me . Was it not a proof , that I must needs fly out at such a petty provocation ? '
23978	24015	23927	23927	her	159	' I should not have thought it such a very exciting life ; certainly not such as is usually said to lead to thoughtlessness ; and we have been even quieter than usual since you came . '
24016	24030	24032	24032	Guy	150	' Ah , you do n't know what stuff I am made of , '
24039	24057	24032	24032	Guy	150	' your own home party is enough to do me harm ; it is so exceedingly pleasant . '
24058	24067	23927	23927	her	159	' Pleasant things do not necessarily do harm . '
24068	24156	23927	23927	her	159	' Not to you ; not to people who are not easily unsettled ; but when I go up - stairs , after a talking , merry evening , such as the night before last , I find that I have enjoyed it too much ; I am all abroad ; I can hardly fix my thoughts , and I do n't know what to do , since here I must be , and I ca n't either be silent or sit up in my own room . '
24157	24161	24163	24163	she	1072	' Certainly not , '
24167	24182	24163	24163	she	1072	' there are duties of society which you owe even to us dangerous people . '
24183	24213	24215	24215	Guy	150	' No , no ; do n't misunderstand me . The fault is in myself . If it was not for that , I could learn nothing but good , '
24226	24233	24235	24235	she	1072	' I believe I understand you , '
24253	24340	24235	24235	she	1072	' For your comfort . I believe the unsettled feeling you complain of is chiefly the effect of novelty . You have led so very retired a life , that a lively family party is to you what dissipation would be to other people ; and , as you must meet the world some time or other , it is better the first encounter with it should be in this comparatively innocent form . Go on watching yourself , and it will do you no harm . '
24341	24393	24163	24163	she	1072	' Yes , but if I find it does me harm ? It would be cowardly to run away , and resistance should be from within . Yet , on the other hand , there is the duty of giving up , wrenching oneself from all that has temptation in it . '
24394	24399	24401	24402	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' There is nothing , '
24404	24510	24401	24402	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' that has not temptation in it ; but I should think the rule was plain . If a duty such as that of living among us for the present , and making yourself moderately agreeable , involves temptations , they must be met and battled from within . In the same way , your position in society , with all its duties , could not be laid aside because it is full of trial . Those who do such things are faint - hearted , and fail in trust in Him who fixed their station , and finds room for them to deny themselves in '
24518	24541	24163	24163	she	1072	' It is pleasure involving no duty that should be given up , if we find it liable to lead us astray . '
24542	24546	24548	24548	Guy	150	' I see , '
24552	24612	24548	24548	Guy	150	' and this reading comes naturally , and is just what I wanted to keep the pleasant things from getting a full hold on me . I ought to have thought of it sooner , instead of dawdling a whole month in idleness . Then all this would not have happened . I hope it will be very tough . '
24613	24624	24163	24163	she	1072	' You have no great love for Latin and Greek ? '
24625	24628	24630	24630	Guy	150	' Oh ! '
24634	24707	24708	24708	He	150	' to be sure , I delight in Homer and the Georgics , and plenty more . What splendid things there are in these old fellows ! But I never liked the drudgery part of the affair ; and now if I am to be set to work to be accurate , and to get up all the grammar and the Greek roots , it will be horrid enough in all conscience . '
24726	24732	24734	24735	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Who was your tutor ? '
24737	24741	24743	24743	Guy	150	' Mr. Potts , '
24745	24937	24743	24743	Guy	150	' He is a very clever man ; he had a common grammar - school education , but he struggled on — taught himself a great deal — and at last thought it great promotion to be a teacher at the Commercial Academy , as they call it , at Moorworth , where Markham 's nephews went to school . He is very clever , I assure you , and very patient of the hard , wearing life he must have of it there , and oh ! so enjoying a new book or an afternoon to himself . When I was about eight or nine , I began with him , riding into Moorworth three times in a week ; and I have gone on ever since . I am sure he has done the best he could for me ; and he made the readings very pleasant by his own enjoyment . If Philip had known the difficulties that man has struggled through , and his beautiful temper , persevering in doing his best and being contented , I am sure he could never have spoken contemptuously of him . '
24938	24946	24948	24949	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I am sure he would not , '
24951	24982	24948	24949	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' all he meant was , that a person without a university education can not tell what the requirements are to which a man must come up in these days . '
24983	24986	24988	24988	Guy	150	' Ah ! '
24992	25058	24988	24988	Guy	150	' how I wished Mr. Potts had been there to have enjoyed listening to Philip and Mr. Lascelles discussing some new lexicon , digging down for roots of words , and quoting passages of obscure Greek poets at such a rate , that if my eyes had been shut I could have thought them two withered old students in spectacles and snuff - coloured coats . '
25059	25066	25068	25069	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Philip was in his element , '
25073	25076	25078	25078	Guy	150	' Really , '
25083	25119	25078	25078	Guy	150	' the more I hear and see of Philip , the more I wonder . What a choice collection of books he has — so many of them school prizes , and how beautifully bound . '
25120	25169	24988	24988	Guy	150	' Ah ! that is one of Philip 's peculiar ways . With all his prudence and his love of books , I believe he would not buy one unless he had a reasonable prospect of being able to dress it handsomely . Did you see the print ? '
25170	25243	25078	25078	Guy	150	' Yes , that I did . What glorious loveliness ! There is nothing that does it justice but the description in the lectures . Oh ! I forgot you have not heard it . You must let me read it to you by - and - by . Those two little angels , what faces they have ! Perfect innocence — one full of reasoning , the other of unreasoning adoration ! '
25244	25249	25252	25253	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I see it ! '
25255	25286	25252	25253	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I see what you are like , in one of your looks , not by any means in all — it is to the larger of those two angels . '
25287	25295	25297	25297	Guy	150	' Very seldom , I should guess , '
25316	25350	25313	25313	he	150	' My real likeness is old Sir Hugh 's portrait at home . But what were we saying ? Oh ! about Philip . How nice those stories were of Mrs. Deane 's . '
25351	25359	25252	25253	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' She is very fond of him . '
25360	25438	25313	25313	he	150	' To have won so much esteem and admiration already , from strangers with no prejudice in his favour . — It must be entirely his own doing ; and well it may ! Every time one hears of him , something comes out to make him seem more admirable . You are laughing at me , and I own it is presumptuous to praise ; but I did not mean to praise , only to admire . '
25439	25459	25313	25313	he	150	' I like very much to hear my nephew praised ; I was only smiling at your enthusiastic way . '
25460	25470	25472	25472	Guy	150	' I only wonder I am not more enthusiastic , '
25474	25513	25472	25472	Guy	150	' I suppose it is his plain good sense that drives away that sort of feeling , for he is as near heroism in the way of self - sacrifice as a man can be in these days . '
25514	25566	25313	25313	he	150	' Poor Philip ! if disappointment can make a hero , it has fallen to his share . Ah ! Guy , you are brightening and looking like one of my young ladies in hopes of a tale of true love crossed , but it was only love of a sister . '
25567	25578	25313	25313	he	150	' The sister for whom he gave up so much ? '
25579	25772	25313	25313	he	150	' Yes , his sister Margaret . She was eight or nine years older , very handsome , very clever , a good deal like him — a pattern elder sister ; indeed , she brought him up in great part after his mother died , and he was devoted to her . I do believe it made the sacrifice of his prospects quite easy to him , to know it was for her sake , that she would live on at Stylehurst , and the change be softened to her . Then came Fanny 's illness , and that led to the marriage with Dr. Henley . It was just what no one could object to ; he is a respectable man in full practice , with a large income ; but he is much older than she is , not at all her equal in mind or cultivation , and , though I hardly like to say so , not at all a religious man . At any rate , Margaret Morville was one of the last people one could bear to see marry for the sake of an establishment . '
25773	25780	25313	25313	he	150	' Could her brother do nothing ? '
25781	25873	25313	25313	he	150	' He expostulated with all his might ; but at nineteen he could do little with a determined sister of twenty - seven ; and the very truth and power of his remonstrance must have made it leave a sting . Poor fellow , I believe he suffered terribly — just as he had lost Fanny , too , which he felt very deeply , for she was a very sweet creature , and he was very fond of her . It was like losing both sisters and home at once . '
25874	25885	25313	25313	he	150	' Has he not just been staying with Mrs. Henley ? '
25886	25991	25313	25313	he	150	' Yes . There was never any coolness , as people call it . He is the one thing she loves and is proud of . They always correspond , and he often stays with her ; but he owns to disliking the Doctor , and I do n't think he has much comfort in Margaret herself , for he always comes back more grave and stern than he went . Her house , with all her good wishes , can be no home to him ; and so we try to make Hollywell supply the place of Stylehurst as well as we can . '
25992	26005	25313	25313	he	150	' How glad he must be to have you to comfort him ! '
26006	26085	25313	25313	he	150	' Philip ? Oh no . He was always reserved ; open to no one but Margaret , not even to his father ; and since her marriage he has shut himself up within himself more than ever . It has , at least I think it is this that has given him a severity , an unwillingness to trust , which I believe is often the consequence of a great disappointment either in love or in friendship . '
26086	26093	26095	26095	Guy	150	' Thank you for telling me , '
26097	26142	26095	26095	Guy	150	' I shall understand him better and look up to him more . Oh ! it is a cruel thing to find that what one loves is , or has not been , all one thought . What must he not have gone through ! '
26196	26372	26194	26195	Mr. Lascelles	225	' opinion of his pupil , and in time she learnt that he thought Sir Guy had very good abilities , and a fair amount of general information ; but that his classical knowledge was far from accurate , and mathematics had been greatly neglected . He had been encouraged to think his work done , when he had gathered the general meaning of a passage , or translated it into English verse , spirited and flowing , but often further from the original than he or his tutor could perceive . He had never been taught to work , at least as other boys study , and great application would be requisite to bring his attainments to a level with those of far less clever boys educated at a public school . Mr. Lascelles told him so at first ; but as there were no reflections on his grandfather or on Mr. Potts , Guy 's lip did not suffer , and he only asked how many hours a day he ought to read . '
26375	26403	26194	26195	Mr. Lascelles	225	' said Mr. Lascelles , with due regard to a probable want of habits of application ; but then remembering how much was undone , he added that '
26416	26417	26194	26195	Mr. Lascelles	225	' '
26423	26427	26194	26195	Mr. Lascelles	225	' said Guy ; '
26433	26840	26430	26430	I	0	' His whole strength of will was set to accomplish these four hours , taking them before and after breakfast , working hard all the morning till the last hour before luncheon , when he came to read the lectures on poetry with Charles . Here for the first time it appeared that Charles had so entirely ceased to consider him as company as to domineer over him like his own family . Used as Guy had been to an active out - of - doors life , and now turned back to authors he had read long ago , to fight his way through the construction of their language , not excusing himself one jot of the difficulty , nor turning aside from one mountain over which his own efforts could carry him , he found his work as tough and tedious as he could wish or fear , and by the end of the morning was thoroughly fagged . Then would have been the refreshing time for recreation in that pleasant idling place , the Hollywell drawing - room . Any other time of day would have suited Charles as well for the reading , but he liked to take the hour at noon , and never perceived that this made all the difference to his friend of a toil or a pleasure . Now and then Guy gave tremendous yawns ; and once when Charles told him he was very stupid , proposed a different time ; but as Charles objected , he yielded as submissively as the rest of the household were accustomed to do . To watch Guy was one of Charles 's chief amusements , and he rejoiced greatly in the prospect of hearing his history of his first dinner - party . Mr. , Mrs. , and Miss Edmonstone , and Sir Guy Morville were invited to dine with Mr. and Mrs. Brownlow . Mr. Edmonstone was delighted as usual with any opportunity of seeing his neighbours ; Guy looked as if he did not know whether he liked the notion or not ; Laura told him it would be very absurd and stupid , but there would be some good music , and Charles ordered her to say no more , that he might have the account , the next morning , from a fresh and unprejudiced mind . His next morning 's question was , of course , '
26848	26849	26843	26843	you	1074	' '
26857	26873	26843	26843	you	1074	' Guy 's favourite answer was caught up in the midst , as Laura replied , '
26883	26884	26843	26843	you	1074	' '
26906	26907	26903	26904	Mrs. Brownlow	235	' '
26912	26916	26903	26904	Mrs. Brownlow	235	' said Laura , '

26953	26961	26951	26951	Guy	150	' said Charles , enjoying the laugh . '

27837	27858	27863	27863	her	1095	' said Charles , vexed at interference with his sport of amazing the Harpers with outrageous stories of Mrs. Brownlow . '
27865	27871	27863	27863	her	1095	' said one of them . '
27880	27881	27877	27878	Mrs. Brownlow	235	' '
27888	27894	27895	27895	I	0	' said Guy , gently . '
27917	27944	27906	27906	I	0	' Charles became sullenly silent ; Guy stood thoughtful , and Laura and Amabel could not easily sustain the conversation till the visitors took their leave . '
27950	27961	27906	27906	I	0	' grumbled Charles , as soon as they were gone . '
27971	27975	27962	27962	I	0	' said Guy , '
27989	27990	27983	27983	I	0	' '
27993	27997	27983	27983	I	0	' said Charles . '
28013	28014	28007	28007	She	1098	' '
28023	28027	28007	28007	She	1098	' said Laura . '
28032	28036	28037	28038	Little wings	239	' said Charles . '
28040	28048	28037	28038	Little wings	239	' said Guy , glancing at Amabel . '
28055	28064	28051	28051	your	1095	' said Charles , throwing his head back ; '
28077	28096	28099	28099	him	1101	' Guy 's brows were contracted with vexation , but Laura looked up very prettily , saying , — '
28113	28114	28115	28115	You	1101	' '
28123	28313	28121	28121	Philip	454	' growled Charles . There was no reply , and presently Guy asked whether he would go up to dress . Having no other way of showing his displeasure , he refused , and remained nursing his ill humour , till he forgot how slight the offence had been , and worked himself into a sort of insane desire — half mischievous , half revengeful — to be as provoking as he could in his turn . Seldom had he been more contrary , as his old nurse was wo nt to call it . No one could please him , and Guy was not allowed to do anything for him . Whatever he said was intended to rub on some sore place in Guy 's mind . His mother and Laura 's signs made him worse , for he had the pleasure of teazing them also ; but Guy endured it all with perfect temper , and he grew more cross at his failure ; yet from force of habit , at bed - time , he found himself on the stairs with Guy 's arm supporting him . '
28317	28331	28115	28115	You	1101	' said Guy , when he had landed him in his own room . '
28335	28339	28340	28340	I	0	' said Charles ; '
28360	28416	28340	28340	I	0	' This plea of trying experiments was neither absolutely true nor false ; but it restored Charles to himself , by saving a confession that he had been out of temper , and enabling him to treat with his wonted indifference the expostulations of father , mother , and Laura . Now that the idea of '
28421	28569	28570	28570	I	0	' had once occurred , it became his great occupation to attempt it . He wanted to see some evidence of the fiery temper , and it was a new sport to try to rouse it ; one , too , which had the greater relish as it kept the rest of the family on thorns . He would argue against his real opinion , talk against his better sense , take the wrong side , and say much that was very far from his true sentiments . Guy could not understand at first , and was quite confounded at some of the views he espoused , till Laura came to his help , greatly irritating her brother by hints that he was not in earnest . Next time she could speak to Guy alone , she told him he must not take all Charles said literally . '
28585	28586	28581	28581	he	1103	' '
28645	28709	28710	28710	You	0	' From that time Guy seemed to have no trouble in reining in his temper in arguing with Charles , except once , when the lion was fairly roused by something that sounded like a sneer about King Charles I. His whole face changed , his hazel eye gleamed with light like an eagle 's , and he started up , exclaiming , — '
28716	28717	28710	28710	You	0	' '
28721	28738	28718	28719	Ask Strafford	240	' answered Charles , coolly , startled , but satisfied to have found the vulnerable point . '
28743	28756	28710	28710	You	0	' said Guy , his voice low , but quivering with indignation ; '
28779	28804	28775	28775	his	1103	' but as he spoke , the gleam of wrath faded , the flush deepened on the cheek , and he left the room . '
28807	28811	28812	28812	I	0	' soliloquized Charles , '
28899	28908	28909	28909	I	0	' In about ten minutes Guy came back : '
28918	28922	28912	28912	I	0	' said he . '
28936	28937	28927	28927	you	0	' '
28946	28950	28951	28951	you	0	' proceeded Guy , '
28975	28976	28969	28969	you	0	' '
28996	28997	28993	28994	a roundhead	1109	' '
29001	29005	28999	28999	you	0	' said Guy , '
29034	29115	29021	29021	you	0	' His brow darkened into a stern , grave expression , so entirely in earnest , that Charles , though making no answer , could not do otherwise than feel compliance unavoidable . Charles had never been so entirely conquered , yet , strange to say , he was not , as usual , rendered sullen . At night , when Guy had taken him to his room , he paused , and said,—'You are sure you have forgiven me ? '
29116	29126	29128	29128	Charles	149	' What ! you have not forgotten that yet ? '
29130	29135	29128	29128	Charles	149	' Of course not . '
29136	29146	29148	29148	Charles	149	' I am sorry you bear so much malice , '
29152	29158	29160	29160	Guy	150	' What are you imagining ? '
29162	29179	29160	29160	Guy	150	' It was my own part I was remembering , as I must , you know . '
29194	29214	29187	29187	he	149	' I thought King Charles 's wrongs were rankling . I only spoke as taking liberties with a friend . '
29215	29218	29220	29220	Guy	150	' Yes , '
29224	29293	29295	29295	Guy	150	' it may be foolish , but I do not feel as if one could do so with King Charles . He is too near home ; he suffered too much from scoffs and railings ; his heart was too tender , his repentance too deep for his friends to add one word even in jest to the heap of reproach . How one would have loved him ! '
29305	29351	29295	29295	Guy	150	' loved him for the gentleness so little accordant with the rude times and the part he had to act — served him half like a knight 's devotion to his lady - love , half like devotion to a saint , as Montrose did — '
29356	29364	29295	29295	Guy	150	' cried he , with sudden vehemence , '
29373	29374	29375	29375	You	150	' '
29378	29382	29383	29383	I	0	' said Charles . '
29401	29402	29390	29390	Deloraine	198	' '
29408	29419	29405	29405	your	150	' said Guy , suddenly recalled , and colouring deeply ; '
29460	29461	29475	29475	I	0	' '
29466	29470	29475	29475	I	0	' thought Charles ; '
29742	29748	29729	29729	his	150	' prancing in the hall . '
30114	30118	30120	30120	Laura	454	' It was , '
30122	30134	30120	30120	Laura	454	' a banshee story in Eveleen de Courcy 's last letter . '
30135	30151	30154	30154	Amabel	234	' I never like telling ghost stories to people who do n't believe in them , '
30159	30165	30167	30167	Philip	454	' Do you believe them ? '
30174	30192	30194	30194	Laura	454	' Now I wo nt have little A my asked the sort of question she most dislikes , '
30196	30213	30194	30194	Laura	454	' I had rather ask if you laugh at us for thinking many ghost stories inexplicable ? '
30214	30218	30194	30194	Laura	454	' Certainly not . '
30219	30232	30234	30234	Guy	150	' The universal belief could hardly be kept up without some grounds , '
30236	30245	30247	30247	Philip	454	' That would apply as well to fairies , '
30249	30258	30260	30260	Amy	210	' Every one has an unexplained ghost story , '
30262	30265	30267	30267	Philip	454	' Yes , '
30269	30303	30267	30267	Philip	454	' but I would give something to meet any one whose ghost story did not rest on the testimony of a friend 's cousin 's cousin , a very strong - minded person . '
30304	30323	30325	30325	Amy	210	' I ca n't imagine how a person who had seen a ghost could ever speak of it , '
30327	30340	30342	30342	Laura	454	' Did not you tell us a story of pixies at Redclyffe ? '
30344	30372	30374	30374	Guy	150	' O yes ; the people there believe in them firmly . Jonas Ledbury heard them laughing one night when he could not get the gate open , '
30376	30386	30388	30388	Philip	454	' Ah ! you are the authority for ghosts , '
30390	30395	30397	30397	Laura	454	' I forgot that , '
30399	30411	30397	30397	Laura	454	' I wonder we never asked you about your Redclyffe ghost . '
30412	30423	30425	30425	Philip	454	' You look as if you had seen it yourself , '
30427	30432	30434	30434	Amy	210	' You have not ? '
30439	30449	30451	30451	Philip	454	' Come , let us have the whole story , '
30453	30519	30451	30451	Philip	454	' Was it your own reflection in the glass ? was it old Sir Hugh ? or was it the murderer of Becket ? Come , the ladies are both ready to scream at the right moment . Never mind giving him a cocked - hat , for with whom may you take a liberty , if not with an ancestral ghost of your own ? '
30596	30601	30593	30593	he	454	' Beware of trifling — '
30612	30618	30620	30621	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' What 's the matter ? '
30645	30648	30638	30638	her	618	' Nothing . '
30649	30656	30658	30658	Laura	454	' How could you , Philip ? '
30660	30669	30671	30671	Amy	210	' I really believe he has seen it ! '
30678	30690	30692	30692	Philip	454	' He has felt it , Amy — the Morville spirit , '
30694	30711	30713	30713	Laura	454	' It is a great pity you spoke of putting a cocked - hat to it , '
30715	30730	30713	30713	Laura	454	' he must have suspected us of telling you what happened about Mrs. Brownlow . '
30731	30741	30743	30744	her sister	716	' And are you going to do it now ? '
30752	30760	30762	30762	Laura	454	' I think Philip should hear it , '
30814	30889	30785	30785	he	916	' Do not think of one falsity as harmless , and another as slight , and another as unintended . Cast them all aside . They may be light and accidental , but they are an ugly soot from the smoke of the pit , for all that ; and it is better that our hearts should be swept clean of them , without over care as to which is the largest or blackest . '
30939	30944	30946	30946	he	916	' I am cautious , '
30952	30986	30946	30946	he	916	' I am not to be told of the necessity of exercising forbearance with this poor boy ; but it is impossible to reckon on all the points on which he is sensitive . '
30987	30992	30994	30994	Laura	454	' He is sensitive , '
30996	31091	30946	30946	he	916	' I do n't mean only in temper , but in everything . I wonder if it is part of his musical temperament to be as keenly alive to all around , as his ear is to every note . A bright day , a fine view , is such real happiness to him ; he dwells on every beauty of Redclyffe with such affection ; and then , when he reads , Charles says it is like going over the story again himself to watch his face act it in that unconscious manner . '
31092	31105	31107	31107	Amy	210	' He makes all the characters so real in talking them over , '
31109	31124	31107	31107	Amy	210	' and he does not always know how they will end before they begin . '
31125	31146	31148	31148	Philip	454	' I should think it hardly safe for so excitable a mind to dwell much on the world of fiction , '
31150	31160	31162	31162	Laura	454	' Nothing has affected him so much as Sintram , '
31164	31263	31162	31162	Laura	454	' I never saw anything like it . He took it up by chance , and stood reading it while all those strange expressions began to flit over his face , and at last he fairly cried over it so much , that he was obliged to fly out of the room . How often he has read it I can not tell ; I believe he has bought one for himself , and it is as if the engraving had a fascination for him ; he stands looking at it as if he was in a dream . '
31264	31271	31273	31273	Amy	210	' He is a great mystery , '
31275	31281	31283	31283	Philip	454	' All men are mysterious , '
31285	31338	31283	31283	Philip	454	' but he not more than others , though he may appear so to you , because you have not had much experience , and also because most of the men you have seen have been rounded into uniformity like marbles , their sharp angles rubbed off against each other at school . '
31339	31508	31273	31273	Amy	210	' Would it be better if there were more sharp angles ? said Laura , thus setting on foot a discussion on public schools , on which Philip had , of course , a great deal to say . Amy 's kind little heart was meanwhile grieving for Guy , and longing to see him return , but he did not come till after Philip 's departure . He looked pale and mournful , his hair hanging loose and disordered , and her terror was excited lest he might actually have seen his ancestor 's ghost , which , in spite of her desire to believe in ghost in general , she did not by any means wish to have authenticated . He was surprised and a good deal vexed to find Philip gone , but he said hardly anything , and it was soon bed - time . When Charles took his arm , he exclaimed , on finding his sleeve we—'What can you have been doing ? '
31509	31518	31520	31520	Guy	150	' Walking up and down under the wall , '
31526	31533	31520	31520	Guy	150	' What , in the rain ? '
31534	31544	31545	31545	Amy	210	' I do n't know , perhaps it was . '
31624	31644	31609	31609	he	150	' I am sorry I disturbed your evening . I will tell you the meaning of it another time . '
31645	31653	31657	31657	Amy	210	' He has certainly seen the ghost ! '
31673	31675	31660	31660	she	210	' eerie '
31721	31725	31726	31726	Her	210	' Another time ! '
31822	31823	31814	31814	you	454	' '
31833	31842	31824	31824	Amy	210	' said Laura , trying to be gay . '
31848	31859	31844	31844	I	0	' said Guy , turning round , full of compunction . '
31883	31884	31878	31878	I	0	' '
31890	31896	31885	31885	I	0	' said Amy , smiling . '
31899	31903	31885	31885	I	0	' proceeded Guy , '
31925	31926	31921	31921	Philip	454	' '
31933	31937	31929	31929	he	454	' cried Laura ; '
31969	31970	31958	31958	I	0	' '
31979	31983	31971	31971	I	0	' said Guy . '
32066	32067	32047	32047	he	161	' '
32074	32078	32079	32079	He	161	' said Laura . '
32281	32306	32276	32276	you	1170	' and Guy repeated them in the low rigid tone , almost of horror , in which he had been telling the history : — '
32341	32342	32329	32329	himself	161	' '
32345	32349	32329	32329	himself	161	' said Laura . '
32371	32372	32364	32364	you	1170	' '
32380	32384	32375	32375	I	0	' answered Guy . '
32440	32467	32469	32469	Sintram	246	' The girls were silent , struck with awe and dismay at the fearful reality with which he pronounced the words . At last Amy whispered , '
32474	32488	32469	32469	Sintram	246	' At the same time Laura gathered her thoughts together , and said , '
32523	32524	32519	32519	their	1177	' '
32541	32545	32519	32519	their	1177	' said Guy . '
32588	32611	32571	32574	My own poor father	1178	' Laura saw the idea was too deeply rooted to be treated as a fancy , and she found a better argument . '
32639	32640	32641	32641	He	1178	' '
32646	32714	32641	32641	He	1178	' said Amy , raising her eyes to his face , and then casting the down , blushing at having understood his countenance , where , in the midst of the gloomy shades , there rested for an instant the gleam which her mother had likened to the expression of Raffaelle 's cherub . They walked on for some time in silence . At last Laura exclaimed , '
32727	32735	32724	32725	Sir Hugh	161	' Guy made a sign of assent . '
32748	32822	32744	32744	he	1178	' said Amy ; and Laura felt the same conviction , that treacherous revenge could never have existed beneath so open a countenance , with so much of highmindedness , pure faith , and contempt of wrong in every glance of the eagle eye , in the frank expansion of the smooth forehead . They were interrupted by Mr. Edmonstone 's hearty voice , bawling across the garden for one of the men . '
32830	32841	32827	32827	you	150	' cried he , as soon as he saw him . '
32860	32890	32891	32892	Poor fellow	5179	' Guy ran off at full speed in search of his gun , whistling to Bustle . Mr. Edmonstone found his man , and the sisters were again alone . '
32894	32898	32891	32892	Poor fellow	5179	' said Laura . '
32908	32912	32906	32906	Philip	454	' said Amy . '
32928	32929	32930	32930	I	0	' '
32957	33004	32947	32947	I	0	' The two girls had taken their walk , and were just going in , when , looking round , they saw Philip walking fast and determinedly up the approach , and as they turned back to meet him , the first thing he said was , '
33009	33010	33007	33007	Guy	150	' '
33021	33022	33014	33014	papa	5164	' '

33069	33089	33049	33049	you	1186	' It was a card of Sir Guy Morville , on the back of which was written in pencil , '

33121	33125	33168	33168	he	150	' said Philip , '

33142	33150	33151	33151	you	1186	' cried Laura , colouring with eagerness , '
33214	33215	33218	33218	he	150	' '
33230	33238	33228	33228	he	150	' Laura 's colour grew still deeper . '
33245	33249	33250	33250	you	1186	' she said , '

33361	33365	33366	33366	He	150	' said Laura . '

33442	33617	33618	33618	He	1195	' Laura still spoke for Guy , and Amy rejoiced ; for if her sister had not taken up the defence of the absent , she must , and she felt too strongly to be willing to speak . It seemed too absurd for one feeling himself under such a doom to wrangle about a horse , yet she was somewhat amused by the conviction that if Guy had really wished to annoy Philip he had certainly succeeded . There was no coming to an agreement . Laura 's sense of justice revolted at the notion of Guy 's being guiltd of petty spite ; while Philip , firm in his preconceived idea of his character , and his own knowledge of mankind , was persuaded that he had imputed the true motive , and was displeased at Laura 's attempting to argue the point . He could not wait to see any one else , as he was engaged to dine out , and he set off again at his quick resolute pace . '

While Guy went to shut up Bustle , who was too wet for the drawing - room , Mr. Edmonstone came up to the others , kicking away the pebbles before him , and fidgeting with his gloves as he always did , when vexed .

34845	34859	34861	34862	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I should not like to use any one as you use yourself , '

35254	35317	35235	35235	he	652	' And here , recollecting that she must not speak ill of old Sir Guy , nor palliate his son 's conduct , poor Mrs. Edmonstone got into an inextricable confusion — all the worse because the fierce twisting of a penwiper in Guy 's fingers denoted that he was suffering a great trial of patience . She avoided the difficulty thus : '
35727	35730	35724	35724	he	747	' Marianne ; '
35769	35774	35749	35749	Guy	150	' Is that all ? '
35775	35813	35815	35816	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' All that I like to read to you . Indeed , there is no more about her ; and it would be of no use to read all the reports that were going about.—Ah ! here , '
35823	35854	35815	35816	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' she speaks of your father as a very fine young man , with most generous impulses,'—but here again she was obliged to stop , for the next sentence spoke of '
35862	35863	35864	35864	She	254	' '
35870	35875	35864	35864	She	254	' continued Mrs. Edmonstone ; '
35917	35918	35901	35902	my brother	578	' '
35926	35930	35921	35921	he	652	' said Guy ; '
35965	35973	35975	35975	you	0	' After another silence , he said , '
35980	36838	35975	35975	you	0	' and when he had heard it , he sat shading his brow with his hand , as if to bring the fair , girlish picture fully before his mind , while Mrs. Edmonstone sought in vain among her letters for one which did not speak of the fiery passions , excited on either side , in terms too strong to be fit for his ears . When next he spoke , it was to repeat that he had not been informed of the history of his parents till within the last few months . He had of course known the manner of their death , but had only lately become aware of the circumstances attending it . The truth was , that Guy had grown up peculiarly shielded from evil , but ignorant of the cause of the almost morbid solicitude with which he was regarded by his grandfather . He was a very happy , joyous boy , leading an active , enterprising life , though so lonely as to occasion greater dreaminess and thoughtfulness than usual at such an early age . He was devotedly attached to his grandfather , looking on him as the first and best of human beings , and silencing the belief that Sir Hugh Morville had entailed a doom of crime and sorrow on the family , by a reference to him , as one who had been always good and prosperous . When , however , Guy had reached an age at which he must encounter the influences which had proved so baneful to others of his family , his grandfather thought it time to give him the warning of his own history . The sins , which the repentance of years had made more odious in the eyes of the old man , were narrated ; the idleness and insubordination at first , then the reckless pursuit of pleasure , the craving for excitement , the defiance of rule and authority , till folly had become vice , and vice had led to crime . He had fought no fewer than three duels , and only one had been bloodless . His misery after the first had well nigh led to a reform ; but time had dulled its acuteness — it had been lost in fresh scenes of excitement — and at the next offence rage had swept away such recollections . Indeed , so far had he lost the natural generosity of his character , that his remorse had been comparatively slight for the last , which was the worst of all , since he had forced the quarrel on his victim , Captain Wellwood , whose death had left a wife and children almost destitute . His first awakening to a sense of what his course had been , was when he beheld his only child , in the prime of youth , carried lifeless across his threshold , and attributed his death to his own intemperance and violence . That hour made Sir Guy Morville an old and a broken - hearted man ; and he repented as vigorously as he had sinned . From the moment he dared to hope that his son 's orphan would be spared , he had been devoted to him , but still mournfully , envying and yet pitying his innocence as something that could not last . He saw bright blossoms put forth , as the boy grew older ; but they were not yet fruits , and he did not dare to believe they ever would be . The strength of will which had , in his own case , been the slave of his passions , had been turned inward to subdue the passions themselves , but this was only the beginning,—the trial was not yet come . He could hope his grandson might repent , but this was the best that he dared to think possible . He could not believe that a Morville could pass unscathed through the world , or that his sins would not be visited on the head of his only descendant ; and the tone of his narration was throughout such as might almost have made the foreboding cause its own accomplishment . The effect was beyond what he had expected ; for a soul deeply died in guilt , even though loathing its own stains , had not the power of conceiving how foul was the aspect of vice , to one hitherto guarded from its contemplation , and living in a world of pure , lofty daydreams . The boy sat the whole time without a word , his face bent down and hidden by his clasped hands , only now and then unable to repress a start or shudder at some fresh disclosure ; and when it was ended , he stood up , gazed round , and walked uncertainly , as if he did not know where he was . His next impulse was to throw himself on his knee beside his grandfather , and caress him as he used when a child . The '
36841	37144	35975	35975	you	0	' was spoken , and Guy was shut into his room , with his overwhelming emotions . His grandfather a blood - stained , remorseful man ! The doom complete , himself heir to the curse of Sir Hugh , and fated to run the same career ; and as he knew full well , with the tendency to the family character strong within him , the germs of these hateful passions ready to take root downwards and bear fruit upwards , with the very countenance of Sir Hugh , and the same darkening , kindling eyes , of which tradition had preserved the remembrance . He was crushed for awhile . The consciousness of strength not his own , of the still small voice that could subdue the fire , the earthquake , and the whirlwind , was slow in coming to him , and when it came , he , like his grandfather , had hope rather of final repentance than of keeping himself unstained . His mind had not recovered the shock when his grandfather died,—died in faith and fear , with good hope of accepted repentance , but unable to convey the assurance of such hope to his grandson . Grief for the only parent he had ever known , and the sensation of being completely alone in the world , were joined to a vague impression of horror at the suddenness of the stroke , and it was long before the influence of Hollywell , or the elasticity of his own youthfulness , could rouse him from his depression . Even then it was almost against his will that he returned to enjoyment , unable to avoid being amused , but feeling as if joy was not meant for him , and as if those around were walking '
37151	38139	35975	35975	you	0	' where he could scarcely hope to tread a few uncertain steps . In this despondency was Guy 's chief danger , as it was likely to make him deem a struggle with temptation fruitless , while his high spirits and powers of keen enjoyment increased the peril of recklessness in the reaction . It was Mrs. Edmonstone who first spoke to him cheerfully of a successful conflict with evil , and made him perceive that his temptations were but such as are common to man . She had given him a clue to discover when and how to trust himself to enjoy ; the story of Sintram had stirred him deeply , and this very day , Amy 's words , seemingly unheeded and unheard , had brought home to him the hope and encouragement of that marvellous tale . They had helped him in standing , looking steadfastly upwards , and treading down not merely evil , but the first token of coming evil , regardless of the bruises he might inflict on himself . Well for him if he was constant . Such was Guy 's inner life ; his outward life , frank and joyous , has been shown , and the two flowed on like a stream , pure as crystal , but into which the eye can not penetrate from its depth . The surface would be sometimes obscured by cloud or shade , and reveal the sombre wells beneath , but more often the sunshine would penetrate the inmost recesses , and make them glance and sparkle , showing themselves as clear and limpid as the surface itself . Scott It must not be supposed that such a history of Guy 's mind was expressed by himself or understood by Mrs. Edmonstone ; but she saw enough to guess at his character , perceive the sort of guidance he needed , and be doubly interested in him . Much did she wish he could have such a friend as her brother would have been , and hope that nothing would prevent a friendship with her nephew . The present question about the horse was , she thought , unfortunate , since , though Guy had exercised great selfdenial , it was no wonder Philip was annoyed . Mr. Edmonstone 's vexation was soon over . As soon as she had persuaded him that there had been no offence , he strove to say with a good grace , that it was very proper , and told Guy he would be a thorough book - worm and tremendous scholar , which Guy took as an excellent joke . Philip had made up his mind to be forbearing , and to say no more about it . Laura thought this a pity , as they could thus never come to an understanding ; but when she hinted it , he wore such a dignified air of not being offended , that she was much ashamed of having tried to direct one so much better able to judge . On his side , Guy had no idea of the trouble he had caused ; so , after bestowing his thanks in a gay , offhand way , which Philip thought the worst feature of the case , he did his best to bring Hecuba back to his mind , drive the hunters out of it , and appease the much - aggrieved William of Deloraine . When all William 's manoeuvres resulted in his master 's not hunting at all , he was persuaded it was Mr. Edmonstone 's fault , compassionated Sir Guy with all his heart , and could only solace himself by taking Deloraine to exercise where he was most likely to meet the hounds . He further chose to demonstrate that he was not Mr. Edmonstone 's servant , by disregarding some of his stable regulations ; but as soon as this came to his master 's knowledge , a few words were spoken , but those so sharp and stern , that William never attempted to disobey again . It seemed as if it was the perception that so much was kept back by a strong force , that made Guy 's least token of displeasure so formidable . A village boy , whom he caught misusing a poor dog , was found a few minutes after by Mr. Ross in a state of terror that was positively ludicrous , though it did not appear that Sir Guy had said or done much to alarm him ; it was only the light in his eyes , and the strength of repressed indignation in his short broken words , that had made the impression . It appeared as if the force of his anger might be fearful , if once it broke forth without control ; yet at the same time he had a gentleness and attention , alike to small and great , which with his high spirit and good nature , his very sweet voice and pleasant smile , made him a peculiarly winning and engaging person ; and few who saw him could help being interested in him . No wonder he had become in the eyes of the Edmonstones almost a part of their family . Mrs. Edmonstone had assumed a motherly control over him , to which he submitted with a sort of affectionate gratitude . One day Philip remarked , that he never saw any one so restless as Guy , who could neither talk nor listen without playing with something . Scissors , pencil , paper - knife , or anything that came in his way , was sure to be twisted and tormented , or if nothing else was at hand , he opened and shut his own knife so as to put all the spectators in fear for his fingers .

38613	38795	38796	38796	Guy	150	' In the course of that evening Philip caused the great atlas to be hunted out , in order to make investigations on the local habitation of a certain Khan of Kipchak , who existed somewhere in the dark age . Thence he came to Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville ; and Guy , who knew both the books in the library at Redclyffe , grew very eager in talking them over , and tracing their adventures — then to the Genoese merchants , where Guy confessed himself perfectly ignorant . Andrea Doria was the only Genoese he ever heard of ; but he hunted out with great interest all the localities of their numerous settlements . Then came modern Italy , and its fallen palaces ; then the contrast between the republican merchant and aristocratic lord of the soil ; then the corn - laws ; and then , and not till then , did Philip glance at his aunt , to show her Guy balancing a Venetian weight on as few of his fingers as could support it . '
38798	38804	38796	38796	Guy	150	' said she , smiling , '
38820	38991	38796	38796	Guy	150	' Guy put it down at once , and Philip proceeded to improved methods of farming , to enable landlords to meet the exigencies of the times . Guy had got hold of Mr. Edmonstone 's spectacle - case , and was putting its spring to a hard trial . Mrs. Edmonstone doubted whether to interfere again ; she knew this was not the sort of thing that tried his temper , yet she particularly disliked playing him off , as it were , for Philip 's amusement , and quite as much letting him go on , and lower himself in her nephew 's estimation . The spectacle - case settled the matter — a crack was heard , it refused to snap at all ; and Guy , much discomfited , made many apologies . Amy laughed ; Philip was much too well - bred to do anything but curl his lip unconsciously . Mrs. Edmonstone waited till he was gone , then , when she was wishing Guy '

39003	39054	39000	39000	she	1255	' The spectacle - case forestalled me in giving you a lecture on sparing our nerves . Do n't look so very full of compunction — it is only a trick which your mother would have stopped at five years old , and which you can soon stop for yourself . '
39055	39062	39064	39064	Guy	150	' Thank you , I will , '
39066	39084	39064	39064	Guy	150	' I hardly knew I did it , but I am very sorry it has teazed you . '

39144	39184	39141	39141	he	150	' I always gave the Morvilles credit for an iron resolution . Yes , Amy , you may laugh ; but if a man is not resolute in a little , he will never be resolute in great matters . '
39185	39197	39199	39199	Laura	454	' And Guy has been resolute the right way this time , '
39201	39209	39211	39211	Philip	454	' May he always be the same , '
39292	39297	39286	39286	She	277	' good - bye ; '
39410	39435	39407	39407	Charles	156	' Do n't you know that Philip considers it due to himself that his audience should never be without conversation suited to their capacity . '
39436	39441	39392	39392	Laura	454	' Nonsense , Charlie ! '
39442	39618	39392	39392	Laura	454	' Nay , I give him credit for doing it as well as it is in the nature of things for it to be done . The strongest proof I know of his being a superior man , is the way he adapts himself to his company . He lays down the law to us , because he knows we are all born to be his admirers ; he calls Thorndale his dear fellow , and conducts him like a Mentor ; but you may observe how different he is with other people — Mr. Ross , for instance . It is not showing off ; it is just what the pattern hero should be with the pattern clergyman . At a dinner - party he is quite in his place ; contents himself with leaving an impression on his neighbour that Mr. Morville is at home on every subject ; and that he is the right thing with his brother officers is sufficiently proved , since not even Maurice either hates or quizzes him . '
39619	39624	39626	39626	Laura	454	' Well , Charlie , '
39631	39641	39626	39626	Laura	454	' I am glad you are convinced at last . '
39642	39735	39392	39392	Laura	454	' Do you think I ever wanted to be convinced that we were created for no other end than to applaud Philip ? I was fulfilling the object of our existence by enlarging on a remark of Guy 's , that nothing struck him more than the way in which Philip could adapt his conversation to the hearers . So the hint was not lost on me ; and I came to the conclusion that it was a far greater proof of his sense than all the maxims he lavishes on us . '
39736	39748	39750	39750	Laura	454	' I wonder Guy was the person to make the remark , '
39752	39768	39750	39750	Laura	454	' for it is strange that those two never appear to the best advantage together . '
39769	39780	39782	39782	Amy	210	' O Laura , that would be the very reason , '
39784	39789	39791	39791	Charles	156	' The very reason ? '
39793	39800	39791	39791	Charles	156	' Draw out your meaning , Miss. '

39810	39844	39806	39806	Amy	210	' If Guy — if a generous person , I mean — were vexed with another sometimes , it would be the very reason he would make the most of all his goodness . '

39853	39871	39851	39851	Charles	156	' What o'clock is it ? I wonder when Guy is ever coming back from that Lascelles . '

39885	39896	39883	39883	Laura	454	' for I see him riding into the stable yard . '
39937	40001	39925	39925	he	156	' at the same time throwing back his shoulders , and composing his countenance to imitate Philip 's lofty deportment and sedate expression , and the next moment , putting his head on one side with a sharp little nod , and giving a certain espiegle glance of the eye and knowing twist of one corner of the mouth , just like Charlotte . '
40006	40010	39925	39925	he	156	' added he , '
40024	40025	40026	40026	I	0	' '
40039	40043	40031	40031	I	0	' said Laura . '

40055	40059	40048	40048	I	0	' said Guy . '
40076	40080	40070	40070	he	156	' said Charles . '
40102	40103	40081	40081	He	156	' '
40114	40118	40081	40081	He	156	' said Guy . '
40152	40153	40140	40140	He	156	' '
40164	40174	40155	40155	you	0	' cried Guy , with a sort of consternation . '
40185	40189	40175	40175	He	156	' said Amy . '
40200	40392	40197	40197	Jupiter	263	' said Charles , and Laura did not know how far to be gratified , or otherwise . Charles had not over - estimated Philip 's readiness of self - adaptation . Charlotte had been very happy with him , talking over the Lady of the Lake , which she had just read , and being enlightened , partly to her satisfaction , partly to her disappointment , as to how much was historical . He listened good - naturedly to a fit of rapture , and threw in a few , not too many , discreet words of guidance to the true principles of taste ; and next told her about an island , in a pond at Stylehurst , which had been by turns Ellen 's isle and Robinson Crusoe 's . It was at this point in the conversation that Guy came in sight , riding slowly , his reins on his horse 's neck , whistling a slow , melancholy tune , his eyes fixed on the sky , and so lost in musings that he did not perceive them till Philip arrested him by calling out , '
40416	40431	40432	40432	You	1267	' Guy started , and gathered up his reins , owning it was foolish . '
40439	40443	40432	40432	You	1267	' said Philip . '
40462	40470	40472	40472	Guy	150	' Nothing so worthy of a stud , '
40480	40491	40472	40472	Guy	150	' I was only dreaming over a picture of ruin — '
40524	40525	40526	40526	Byron	267	' '
40528	40532	40526	40526	Byron	267	' exclaimed Philip , '
40542	40543	40535	40535	you	267	' '
40553	40554	40547	40547	I	0	' '
40560	40564	40547	40547	I	0	' said Philip . '

40597	40629	40535	40535	you	267	' and there was a cloud , but it cleared in a moment , and , with a few gay words to both , he rode off at a quick pace . '
40633	40655	40656	40656	Philip	454	' muttered Philip , looking after him . After some space of silence , Charlotte began in a very grave tone — '
40658	40659	40656	40656	Philip	454	' '
40662	40663	40664	40664	Philip	454	' '
40666	40667	40664	40664	Philip	454	' '
40669	40672	40664	40664	Philip	454	' Well ? '
40678	40693	40664	40664	Philip	454	' Philip , I do n't know whether you 'll be angry with me . '
40694	40698	40700	40700	Philip	454	' Certainly not , '
40707	40727	40700	40700	Philip	454	' Guy says he does not want to keep up the feud , and I wish you would not . '
40728	40734	40664	40664	Philip	454	' What do you mean ? '
40735	40740	40742	40742	Charlotte	277	' The deadly feud ! '
40744	40750	40752	40752	Philip	454	' What nonsense is this ? '
40754	40789	40752	40752	Philip	454	' Surely — O Philip , there always was a deadly feud between our ancestors and the Redclyffe Morvilles , and it was very wrong , and ought not to be kept up now . '
40790	40800	40664	40664	Philip	454	' It is not I that keep it up . '
40801	40806	40808	40808	Charlotte	277	' Is it not ? '
40810	40856	40808	40808	Charlotte	277	' But I am sure you do n't like Guy . And I ca n't think why not , unless it is the deadly feud , for we all are so fond of him . Laura says it is a different house since he came . '
40857	40860	40862	40862	Philip	454	' Hum ! '
40864	40904	40862	40862	Philip	454	' Charlotte , you did well to make me promise not to be angry with you , by which , I presume , you mean displeased . I should like to know what put this notion into your head . '
40905	40910	40913	40913	Charlotte	277	' Charlie told me , '
40920	40925	40913	40913	Charlotte	277	' And — and — '
40926	40935	40936	40936	Charlotte	277	' And what ? I ca n't hear . '
40981	41042	41045	41045	you	277	' She was so alarmed at having said this , that had it not been undignified , she would have run quite away , and never stopped till she came to East Hill . Matters were not mended when Philip said authoritatively , and as if he was not in the least annoyed ( which was the more vexatious ) , '
41050	41107	41108	41108	You	1277	' She had a great mind to cry , by way of getting out of the scrape ; but having begun as counsellor and peace - maker , it would never do to be babyish , and on his repeating the question , she said in a tone which she could not prevent from being lachrymose , '
41141	41150	41151	41151	Charlotte	277	' concluded she , with almost a sob . '
41153	41177	41178	41178	you	277	' replied Philip , much more kindly than she thought she deserved , after the reproach that seemed to her so dreadfully naughty , '
41223	41240	41241	41241	You	277	' Charlotte felt as if annihilated at the aspect of her own folly . He resumed , '
41334	41341	41342	41342	I	0	' She could only say humbly , '
41347	41348	41342	41342	I	0	' '
41424	41574	41575	41575	You	1286	' So ended Charlotte 's anxieties respecting the deadly feud ; and she had now to make up her mind to the loss of her playfellow , who was to go to Oxford at Easter , when he would be just eighteen , his birthday being the 28th of March . Both her playmates were going , Bustle as well as Guy , and it was at first proposed that Deloraine should go too , but Guy bethought himself that Oxford would be a place of temptation for William ; and not choosing to trust the horse to any one else , resolved to leave both at Hollywell . His grandfather had left an allowance for Guy , until his coming of age , such as might leave no room for extravagance , and which even Philip pronounced to be hardly sufficient for a young man in his position . '
41578	41592	41575	41575	You	1286	' said Mr. Edmonstone , in his hesitating , good - natured way , '
41631	41636	41626	41626	You	1286	' tis your own . '
41637	41642	41644	41644	Guy	150	' This shall do , '
41737	41758	41760	41760	he	156	' You do n't know what a bore it is to lose the one bit of quicksilver in the house ! '
41764	41777	41760	41760	he	156	' I shall only drag on my existence till you come back . '
41778	41788	41790	41790	Guy	150	' You , Charles , the maker of fun ! '
41794	41804	41806	41806	Charles	156	' It is a case of flint and steel , '
41808	41855	41806	41806	Charles	156	' but be it owing to who it will , we have been alive since you came here . You have taken care to be remembered . We have been studying you , or laughing at you , or wondering what absurdity was to come next . '
41856	41880	41760	41760	he	156	' I am very sorry — that is , if you are serious . I hoped at least I appeared like other people . '
41881	41902	41760	41760	he	156	' I 'll tell you what you appear like . Just what I would be if I was free man . '
41903	41910	41806	41806	Charles	156	' Never say that , Charlie . '
41911	41955	41760	41760	he	156	' Nay , wait a bit . I would never be so foolish . I would never give my sunny mornings to Euripides ; I would not let the best hunter in the county go when I had wherewithal to pay for him . '
41956	41972	41760	41760	he	156	' You would not have such an ill - conditioned self to keep in rule . '
41973	41977	41979	41979	Charles	156	' After all , '
41983	42108	41979	41979	Charles	156	' it is no great compliment to say I am sorry you are going . If you were an Ethiopian serenader you would be a loss to me . It is something to see anything beyond this old drawing - room , and the same faces doing the same things every day . Laura poking over her drawing , and meditating upon the last entry in Philip 's memorandum - book , and Amy at her flowers or some nonsense or other , and Charlotte and the elders all the same , and a lot of stupid people dropping in , and a lot of stupid books to read , all just alike . I can tell what they are like without looking in ! '
42119	42244	41760	41760	he	156	' Now , there came some life and freshness with you . You talk of Redclyffe , and your brute creation there , not like a book , and still less like a commonplace man ; you are innocent and unsophisticated , and take new points of view ; you are something to interest oneself about ; your coming in is something to look forward to ; you make the singing not such mere milk and water ; your reading the Prælectiones is an additional land mark to time , besides the mutton of to - day succeeding the beef of yesterday . Heigh ho ! I 'll tell you what , Guy , though I may carry it off with a high hand , '
42340	42358	42335	42335	I	0	' he proceeded , in a tone of extreme bitterness , though with a sort of smile , '

42468	42520	42444	42444	I	0	' Charles had never till now alluded seriously to his infirmity before Guy , and the changing countenance of his auditor showed him to be much affected , as he stood leaning over the end of the sofa , with his speaking eyes earnestly fixed on Charles , who went on : '
42606	42646	42588	42588	I	0	' ( had it not been for a sort of involuntary respect to the gentle compassion of the softened hazel eyes regarding him so kindly , he would have used the violent expletive that trembled on his lip ) ; '
42677	42678	42680	42680	you	0	' '
42683	42687	42680	42680	you	0	' said Guy . '

42776	42780	42769	42772	such another fellow dunce	1303	' said Charles , '

42822	42837	42814	42814	you	0	' said Guy , as if it was the simplest thing in the world . '

43002	43012	43013	43013	Amy	210	' Amy came into the room at the moment . '
43046	43047	43017	43017	Guy	150	' '
43052	43056	43017	43017	Guy	150	' said Guy . '

43082	43083	43076	43076	you	0	' '

43217	43225	43226	43226	I	0	' cried Amy , colouring with delight . '
43266	43584	43264	43264	you	156	' So it was settled , and Charles declared that he put himself on honour to give a good account of their doings to Guy , that being the only way of making himself steady to his resolution ; but he was perfectly determined not to let Philip know anything about the practice he had adopted , since he would by no means allow him to guess that he was following his advice . Charles had certainly grown very fond of Guy , in spite of his propensity to admire Philip , satisfying himself by maintaining that after all , Guy only tried to esteem his cousin because he thought it a point of duty , just as children think it right to admire the good boy in a story book ; but that he was secretly fretted and chafed by his perfection . No one could deny that there were often occasions when little misunderstandings would arise , and that but for Philip 's coolness and Guy 's readiness to apologize , they might often have gone further ; but at the same time no one could regret these things more than Guy himself , and he was willing and desirous to seek Philip 's advice and assistance when needed . In especial , he listened earnestly to the counsel which was bestowed on him about Oxford ; and Mrs. Edmonstone was convinced that no one could have more anxiety to do right and avoid temptation . She had many talks with him in her dressing - room , promising to write to him , as did also Charles ; and he left Hollywell with universal regrets , most loudly expressed by Charlotte , who would not be comforted without a lock of Bustle 's hair , which she would have worn round her neck if she had not been afraid that Laura would tell Philip . '
43591	43603	43264	43264	you	156	' said Philip , as they watched him from the door . '
43612	43617	43604	43604	I	0	' said Mrs. Edmonstone . '
43623	43627	43264	43264	you	156	' said Philip , '

It was a glorious day in June , the sky of pure deep dazzling blue , the sunshine glowing with brightness , but with cheerful freshness in the air that took away all sultriness , the sun tending westward in his long day 's career , and casting welcome shadows from the tall firs and horse - chestnuts that shaded the lawn . A long rank of haymakers — men and women — proceeded with their rakes , the white shirt - sleeves , straw bonnets , and ruddy faces , radiant in the bath of sunshine , while in the shady end of the field were idler haymakers among the fragrant piles , Charles half lying on the grass , with his back against a tall hay - cock ; Mrs. Edmonstone sitting on another , book in hand ; Laura sketching the busy scene , the sun glancing through the chequered shade on her glossy curls ; Philip stretched out at full length , hat and neck - tie off , luxuriating in the cool repose after a dusty walk from Broadstone ; and a little way off , Amabel and Charlotte pretending to make hay , but really building nests with it , throwing it at each other , and playing as heartily as the heat would allow . They talked and laughed , the rest were too hot , too busy , or too sleepy for conversation , even Philip being tired into enjoying the dolce far niente ; and they basked in the fresh breezy heat and perfumy hay with only now and then a word , till a cold black , damp nose was suddenly thrust into Charles 's face , a red tongue began licking him ; and at the same moment Charlotte , screaming '
44065	44291	44062	44062	he	1317	' raced headlong across the swarths of hay to meet Guy , who had just ridden into the field . He threw Deloraine 's rein to one of the haymakers , and came bounding to meet her , just in time to pick her up as she put her foot into a hidden hole , and fell prostrate . In another moment he was in the midst of the whole party , who crowded round and welcomed him as if he had been a boy returning from his first half - year 's schooling ; and never did little schoolboy look more holiday - like than he , with all the sunshine of that June day reflected , as it were , in his glittering eyes and glowing face , while Bustle , escaping from Charles 's caressing arm , danced round , wagging his tail in ecstacy , and claiming his share of the welcome . Then Guy was on the ground by Charles , rejoicing to find him out there , and then , some dropping into their former nests on the hay , some standing round , they talked fast and eagerly in a confusion of sound that did not subside for the first ten minutes so as to allow anything to be clearly heard . The first distinct sentence was Charlotte 's '
44304	44305	44062	44062	he	1317	' '
44311	44330	44062	44062	he	1317	' next exclaimed Guy , following Philip 's example , by throwing off hat and neck - tie . '
44341	44345	44062	44062	he	1317	' said Charles . '
44358	44371	44372	44372	One	5249	' said Philip , throwing himself completely back , and looking up . '
44382	44386	44372	44372	One	5249	' said Laura . '
44401	44405	44372	44372	One	5249	' hummed Guy . '

44853	44862	44864	44864	Guy	150	' The hay - field best of all , '
44878	44882	44884	44884	Charlotte	277	' Of course ! '
44886	44898	44884	44884	Charlotte	277	' who would not like haymaking better than that stupid ball ? '

45013	45033	45035	45035	Philip	454	' I do n't think it is my business to bring Lord Kilcoran to a sense of his folly , '
45037	45070	45035	45035	Philip	454	' I made all my protests to Maurice when first he started the notion , but if his father chose to take the matter up , it is no concern of mine . '
45071	45078	45080	45080	Charles	156	' You will understand , Guy , '
45082	45097	45080	45080	Charles	156	' that this ball is specially got up by Maurice for Laura 's benefit . '
45110	45114	45108	45108	Guy	150	' said Laura ; '
45160	45161	45156	45156	their	1329	' '

45237	45248	45222	45222	she	244	' And Laura looked pleadingly at Philip as she spoke . '
45259	45263	45264	45267	The two younger girls	1334	' said Guy . '
45278	45282	45274	45276	the little boys	1335	' said Amy . '
45297	45316	45318	45318	Philip	454	' Lord de Courcy is the wisest man of the family , and sets his face against absenteeism , '
45320	45328	45318	45318	Philip	454	' so he is never visible here . '
45329	45349	45274	45276	the little boys	1335	' But you are n't going to despise it , I hope , Guy , said Amy , earnestly ; '
45368	45379	45318	45318	Philip	454	' Guy stretched himself , and gave a quaint grunt . '
45385	45389	45383	45383	Guy	150	' said Philip , '
45407	45408	45409	45409	Your	150	' '
45415	45419	45409	45409	Your	150	' said Laura . '
45434	45438	45429	45430	Mary Ross	208	' said Amy . '

45479	45483	45473	45473	You	150	' said Laura . '

45506	45510	45513	45513	Amy	210	' said Charles , '
45515	45516	45513	45513	Amy	210	' '
45523	45524	45521	45521	Charlie	156	' '
45531	45532	45533	45533	I	0	' '
45539	45546	45533	45533	I	0	' murmured Amy , blushing crimson . '
45557	45562	45550	45550	Charles	156	' said Philip , — '
45594	45603	45604	45604	I	0	' But Amy turned away , doubly ashamed . '
45615	45619	45604	45604	I	0	' said Guy . '
45622	45626	45604	45604	I	0	' said Laura , '
45633	45726	45727	45727	We	1347	' Charlotte , whose absence had become perceptible from the general quietness , here ran up with two envelopes , which she put into Guy 's hand . One was Lady Kilcoran 's genuine card of invitation for Sir Guy Morville , the other Charlotte had scribbled in haste , for Mr. Bustle . This put an end to all rationality . Guy rose with a growl and a roar , and hunted her over half the field , till she was caught , and came back out of breath and screaming , '
45734	45735	45737	45737	I	0	' '
45744	45754	45739	45740	the haymakers	5760	' answered her mother , rising to go indoors . '
45760	45761	45739	45740	the haymakers	5760	' '
45772	45780	45764	45764	I	0	' said Guy , seizing a hayfork . '
45788	45792	45793	45793	I	0	' cried Charles . '
45840	45841	45832	45832	they	1349	' '
45850	45916	45832	45832	they	1349	' said Guy , helping him to rise , and conducting him to his wheeled chair . The others followed , and when , shortly after , Laura looked out at her window , she saw Guy , with his coat off , toiling , like a real haymaker , to build up the cocks in all their neat fairness and height , whistling meantime the '
45922	46205	45832	45832	they	1349	' and now and then singing a line . She watched the old cowman come up , touching his hat , and looking less cross than usual ; she saw Guy 's ready greeting , and their comparison of the forks and rakes , the pooks and cocks of their counties ; and , finally , she beheld her father ride into the field , and Guy spring to meet him . No one could have so returned to what was in effect a home , unless his time had been properly spent ; and , in fact , all that Mr. Edmonstone or Philip could hear of him was so satisfactory , that Philip pronounced that the first stage of the trial had been passed irreproachably , and Laura felt and looked delighted at this sanction to the high estimation in which she held him . His own account of himself to Mrs. Edmonstone would not have been equally satisfactory if she had not had something else to check it with . It was given by degrees , and at many different times , chiefly as they walked round the garden in the twilight of the summer 's evenings , talking over the many subjects mentioned in the letters which had passed constantly . It seemed as if there were very few to whom Guy would ever give his confidence ; but that once bestowed , it was with hardly any reserve , and that it was his great relief and satisfaction to pour out his whole mind , where he was sure of sympathy . To her , then , he confided how much provoked he was with himself , his '
46209	46213	45832	45832	they	1349	' he said , '
46229	46238	45832	45832	they	1349	' By his account , he could do nothing '
46253	46254	45832	45832	they	1349	' '
46263	46310	45832	45832	they	1349	' he could work himself for a given time , but his sense would not second him ; and , was it not most absurd in him to take so little pleasure in what was his duty , and enjoy only what was bad for him ? '
46380	46384	46385	46385	he	1350	' The last , '
46388	46435	46385	46385	he	1350	' might engross him in the same way ; but he thought ( here he hesitated a little ) there were higher ends for music , which made it come under Mrs. Edmonstone 's rule , of a thing to be used guardedly , not disused . '
46455	46460	46461	46461	he	1350	' One wants something , '
46464	46490	46461	46461	he	1350	' by way of refreshment , where there is no sea nor rock to look at , and no Laura and Amy to talk to . '
47046	47057	47044	47044	Charles	156	' Ah , ha ! Paddy , is that you ? '
47164	47165	47141	47141	She	1377	' '
47169	47173	47141	47141	She	1377	' said Charles ; '
47182	47183	47178	47180	the head carpenter	1379	' '
47187	47225	47184	47185	Sir Guy	150	' whispered she , to Laura , looking up at him , where he was mounted on the roof , thatching it with reed , the sunshine full on his glowing face , and white shirt sleeves . '
47228	47254	47184	47185	Sir Guy	150	' said Charles , as Guy swung himself down with a bound , his face much redder than sun and work had already made it , '
47263	47264	47265	47267	Sir Guy Morville	150	' '
47274	47293	47269	47272	Lady Eveleen de Courcy	244	' began Laura ; but Lady Eveleen cut her short , frankly holding out her hand , and saying '
47337	47338	47341	47341	you	150	' '
47344	47348	47341	47341	you	150	' said Laura . '
47363	47373	47374	47374	he	150	' as Guy began to look for his coat ; '

47438	47490	47436	47436	Eva	281	' whispered Laura , reprovingly ; but Lady Eveleen only shook her head at her , and declaring she saw a dangerous nail sticking out , began to hammer it in with such good will , that Charles stopped his ears , and told her it was worse than her tongue . '
47499	47500	47436	47436	Eva	281	' '
47503	47509	47511	47511	you	150	' said she , earnestly . '

47528	47532	47511	47511	you	150	' said Laura . '
47592	47593	47594	47594	You	150	' '
47601	47605	47606	47607	the captain	1323	' said Charles . '
47635	47636	47624	47624	He	1323	' '
47642	47653	47624	47624	He	1323	' said Lady Eveleen , looking at him with compassion . '
47660	47664	47624	47624	He	1323	' said Guy . '
47673	47677	47665	47665	We	1385	' said Laura . '
47685	47693	47694	47694	We	1385	' cried Lady Eveleen , springing up . '
47710	47715	47708	47708	Charles	156	' wheeling him along . '
47725	47734	47721	47721	I	0	' as Guy was going to help her . '
47763	47768	47770	47770	she	1389	'm the other gentleman , '
47832	47839	47840	47840	she	1389	' I like him very much , '
47843	47876	47840	47840	she	1389	' he looks up to anything . I had heard so much of his steadiness , that it is a great relief to my mind to see him so unlike his cousin . '
47877	47880	47820	47820	she	1389	' Eveleen ! '
47881	47914	47840	47840	she	1389	' No disparagement to the captain , only I am so dreadfully afraid of him . I am sure he thinks me such an unmitigated goose . Now , does n't he ? '
47915	47941	47840	47840	she	1389	' If you would but take the right way to make him think otherwise , dear Eva , and show the sense you really have . '
47942	48067	47820	47820	she	1389	' That is just what my fear of him wo nt let me do . I would not for the world let him guess it , so there is nothing for it but sauciness to cover one 's weakness . I ca n't be sensible with those that wo n't give me credit for it . But you 'll mind and teach Sir Guy to dance ; he has so much spring in him , he deserves to be an Irishman . In compliance with this injunction , there used to be a clearance every evening ; Charles turned into the bay window out of the way , Mrs. Edmonstone at the piano , and the rest figuring away , the partnerless one , called '
48073	48322	47820	47820	she	1389	' being generally Amabel , while Charlotte , disdaining them all the time , used to try to make them imitate her dancing - master 's graces , causing her father to perform such caricatures of them as to overpower all with laughing . Mr. Edmonstone was half , Irish . His mother , Lady Mabel Edmonstone , had never thoroughly taken root in England , and on his marriage , had gone with her daughter , to live near the old home in Ireland . The present Earl of Kilcoran was her nephew , and a very close intercourse had always been kept up between the families , Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone being adopted by their younger cousins as uncle and aunt , and always so called . The house at Allonby was in such confusion , that the family there expected to dine nowhere on the day of the ball ; and the Hollywell party thought it prudent to secure their dinner at home , with Philip and Mary Ross , who were to go with them . By special desire , Philip wore his uniform ; and while the sisters were dressing , Charlotte gave him a thorough examination , which led to a talk between him and Mary on accoutrements and weapons in general ; but while deep in some points of chivalrous armour , Mary 's waist was pinched by two mischievous hands , and a little fluttering white figure danced round her . '
48333	48334	48328	48328	you	210	' '
48341	48345	48328	48328	you	210	' said Amy . '
48362	48376	48358	48358	I	0	' said Mary , looking complacently at her full folds of white muslin . '
48392	48400	48383	48383	you	210	' And Amy fluttered away with her . '
48405	48409	48402	48402	you	210	' said Philip , '
48433	48434	48402	48402	you	210	' '
48442	48460	48440	48440	Mary	208	' cried Charlotte ; but Philip stopped her , with orders not to be a silly child . '
48472	48476	48469	48469	her	210	' said Charles . '
48484	48488	48489	48489	She	1394	' asked Guy . '
48509	48513	48489	48489	She	1394	' said Charles ; '
48530	48531	48523	48528	painters — heads et præterea nihil	1395	' '
48540	48544	48536	48536	you	285	' cried Charlotte . '
48548	48556	48536	48536	you	285	' muttered Guy , out of countenance ; '
48571	48572	48536	48536	you	285	' '
48582	48586	48587	48587	I	0	' said Charles . '
48645	48646	48647	48647	I	0	' '
48654	48684	48650	48650	my	0	' said Guy , departing in haste . Charlotte ran after him , to beg for a sight of it ; and Philip asked Charles what it was like ? '
48689	48693	48700	48701	A Petrarch	286	' said Charles , '
48711	48747	48700	48701	A Petrarch	286	' Charles used the word Petrarch to stand for a poet , not thinking what lady 's name it suggested ; and he was surprised at the severity of Philip 's tone as he inquired , '
48758	48777	48755	48755	you	0	' Perceiving with delight that he had perplexed and teazed , he rejoiced in keeping up the mystery : '
48790	48808	48809	48809	I	0	' Philip rose , and standing over him , said , in a low but impressive tone : '
48878	48879	48868	48868	he	1401	' '
48883	48889	48890	48890	I	0	' asked Charles , coolly . '
48893	48908	48890	48890	I	0	' said Philip , retreating to his chair , and speaking with great composure , '
48917	49176	48909	48909	I	0	' Then , as his uncle came into the room , he asked some indifferent question , without betraying a shade of annoyance . Charles meanwhile congratulated himself on his valour in keeping his counsel , in spite of so tall a man in scarlet ; but he was much nettled at the last speech ; for if a real attachment to his sister had been in question , he would never have trifled about it . Keenly alive to his cousin 's injustice , he rejoiced in having provoked and mystified the impassible , though he little knew the storm he had raised beneath that serene exterior of perfect self - command . The carriages were announced , and Mr. Edmonstone began to call the ladies , adding tenfold to the confusion in the dressing - room . There was Laura being completed by the lady's - maid , Amabel embellishing Mary , Mrs. Edmonstone with her arm loaded with shawls , Charlotte flourishing about . Poor Mary — it was much against her will — but she had no heart to refuse the wreath of geraniums that Amy 's own hands had woven for her ; and there she sat , passive as a doll , though in despair at their all waiting for her . For Laura 's toilette was finished , and every one began dressing her at once ; while Charlotte , to make it better , screamed over the balusters that all were ready but Mary . Sir Guy was heard playing the '
49180	49210	48909	48909	I	0	' and Captain Morville 's step was heard , fast and firm . At last , when a long chain was put round her neck , she cried out , '
49225	49282	48909	48909	I	0	' jumped up , caught hold of her shawl , and was putting it on , when there was a general outcry that they must exhibit themselves to Charles . They all ran down , and Amy , flying up to her brother , made a splendid sweeping curtsey , and twirled round in a pirouette . '
49289	49293	49295	49295	yourselves	1404	' cried Charles ; '
49297	49349	49295	49295	yourselves	1404	' The young ladies ranged themselves in imitation of the book of fashions . The sisters were in white , with wreaths of starry jessamine . It was particularly becoming to Laura 's bella - donna lily complexion , rich brown curls , and classical features ; and her brother exclaimed : '
49368	49369	49354	49354	Apollo	274	' '
49377	49381	49382	49382	She	210	' said Laura . '
49406	49407	49388	49388	Guy	150	' '
49418	49431	49416	49416	Guy	150	' said Amy , pointing to it , on Laura 's head , '
49443	49444	49433	49433	you	150	' '
49454	49498	49433	49433	you	150	' said Guy . Philip leant meantime against the door . Laura only once glanced towards him , thinking all this too trifling for him , and never imagining the intense interest with which he gave a meaning to each word and look . '
49504	49508	49502	49502	Mary	208	' cried Charles , '
49516	49648	49509	49509	they	1405	' Mary made a face , and said she should wonder who was the fashionable young lady she should meet in the pier - glasses at Allonby . Then Mr. Edmonstone hurried them away , and they arrived in due time . The saloon at Allonby was a beautiful room , one end opening into a conservatory , full of coloured lamps , fresh green leaves , and hot - house plants . There they found as yet only the home party , the good - natured , merry Lord Kilcoran , his quiet English wife , who had bad health , and looked hardly equal to the confusion of the evening ; Maurice , and two younger boys ; Eveleen , and her two little sisters , Mabel and Helen . '
49656	49787	49509	49509	they	1405	' thought Amy , while the two girls dragged her off to show her the lamps in the conservatory ; and the rest attacked Mrs. Edmonstone for not having brought Charlotte , reproaching her with hardness of heart of which they had never believed her capable — Lady Eveleen , in especial , talking with that exaggeration of her ordinary manner which her dread of Captain Morville made her assume . Little he recked of her ; he was absorbed in observing how far Laura 's conduct coincided with Charles 's hints . On the first opportunity , he asked her to dance , and was satisfied with her pleased acquiescence ; but the next moment , Guy came up , and in an eager manner made the same request . '
49792	49926	49788	49788	I	0	' said , she , with a bright , proud glance at Philip ; and Guy pursued Amabel into the conservatory , where he met with better success . Mr. Edmonstone gallantly asked Mary if he was too old a partner , and was soon dancing , with the step and spring that had once made him the best dancer in the county . Mrs. Edmonstone watched her flock , proud and pleased , thinking how well they looked , and that , in especial , she had never been sensible how much Laura 's and Philip 's good looks excelled the rest of the world . They were much alike in the remarkable symmetry both of figure and feature , the colour of the deep blue eye , and fairness of complexion . '
49931	49936	49788	49788	I	0	' thought Mrs. Edmonstone , '
50036	50043	50044	50044	you	1411	' and she smiled much more , '
50169	50214	50215	50215	Laura	454	' Mrs. Edmonstone might well retain her opinion when , after the quadrille , Guy came to tell her that he had never seen anything so delightful ; and he entertained Mary Ross with his fresh , joyous pleasure , through the next dance , '
50217	50221	50215	50215	Laura	454	' whispered Eveleen , '
50254	50280	50253	50253	I	0	'm afraid he 'll depreciate me to his friend ; and really with Mr. Thorndale , I was no more foolish than a ball requires . '
50324	50333	50335	50335	he	275	' You are a good partner and neighbour , '
50342	50351	50335	50335	he	275	' you do n't want young lady talk . '
50352	50369	50295	50308	a child of eleven , who was enchanted at having so tall a partner	1415	' Should you not have asked Mary ? She has been sitting down this long time . '
50370	50383	50384	50384	Amy	210	' Do you think she cares for such a sport as dancing ? '
50389	50404	50384	50384	Amy	210	' You have been well off . You were dancing with Thorndale just now . '
50405	50459	50295	50308	a child of eleven , who was enchanted at having so tall a partner	1415	' Yes . It was refreshing to have an old acquaintance among so many strangers . And he is so delighted with Eveleen ; but what is more , Philip , that Mr. Vernon , who is dancing with Laura , told Maurice he thought her the prettiest and most elegant person here . '
50460	50467	50469	50469	Philip	454	' Laura might have higher praise , '
50471	50487	50469	50469	Philip	454	' for hers is beauty of countenance even more than of feature . If only — '
50488	50491	50493	50493	Amy	210	' If ? '
50495	50535	50493	50493	Amy	210	' Look round , Amy , and you will see many a face which speaks of intellect wasted , or if cultivated , turned aside from its true purpose , like the double blossom , which bears leaves alone . '

50570	50604	50493	50493	Amy	210	' Keep your child - like temper as long as you can — all your life , perhaps , for this is one of the points where it is folly to be wise . '

50817	50870	50813	50813	he	150	' if you can not discover for yourselves when they are both before your eyes , I will do nothing so invidious as to say which is the pretty one . I 'll tell which is the eldest and which the youngest , but the rest , you must decide for yourself . '

50884	50896	50881	50882	Miss Alston	290	' Oh ! they are both very nice - looking girls . '
50897	50907	50909	50909	Guy	150	' There , that is Laura — Miss Edmonstone , '
50911	50925	50909	50909	Guy	150	' that tall young lady , with the beautiful hair and jessamine wreath . '
51002	51011	51013	51013	Philip	454	' So you knew my cousin at Oxford ? '
51019	51031	51013	51013	Philip	454	' Yes , slightly . What an amusing fellow he is ! '
51032	51046	51048	51049	Miss Alston	290	' There is something very bright , very unlike other people about him , '
51051	51062	51048	51049	Miss Alston	290	' How does he get on ? Is he liked ? '
51063	51093	51013	51013	Philip	454	' Why , yes , I should say so , on the whole ; but it is rather as my sister says , he is not like other people . '
51094	51099	51013	51013	Philip	454	' In what respect ? '
51100	51131	51048	51049	Miss Alston	290	' Oh ! I can hardly tell . He is a very pleasant person , but he ought to have been at school . He is a man of crotchets . '
51132	51137	51013	51013	Philip	454	' Hard - working ? '
51138	51186	51048	51049	Miss Alston	290	' Very ; he makes everything give way to that . He is a capital companion when he is to be had , but he lives very much to himself . He is a man of one friend , and I do n't see much of him . '
51210	51213	51217	51217	himself	454	' Hum ! '
51374	51382	51384	51384	Amy	210	' What is the matter , Eva ? '
51396	51402	51404	51404	Laura	454	' The roc 's egg ? '
51408	51419	51404	51404	Laura	454	' The queen of the evening ca n't be content — '
51420	51444	51384	51384	Amy	210	' No ; you are the queen , if the one thing can make you so — the one thing wanting to me . '
51445	51465	51384	51384	Amy	210	' How absurd you are , Eva — when you say you are so afraid of him , too . '
51466	51500	51404	51404	Laura	454	' That is the very reason . I should get a better opinion of myself ! Besides , there is nobody else so handsome . I declare I 'll make a bold attempt . '
51501	51513	51515	51515	Laura	454	' Oh ! you do n't think of such a thing , '
51521	51525	51527	51527	Eveleen	244	' Never fear , '

51571	51610	51566	51566	her	244	' Captain Morville , I really must scold you . You are setting a shocking example of laziness ! Aunt Edmonstone , how can you encourage such proceedings ! Indolence is the parent of vice , you know . '

51724	51734	51766	51767	Mr. Thorndale	176	' Well , then , he was very obtuse ! '
51735	51742	51697	51697	Amy	210	' Besides , you are engaged . '
51743	51765	51766	51767	Mr. Thorndale	176	' O yes , to Mr. Thorndale ! but who would be content with the squire when the knight disdains her ? '
51827	51833	51811	51812	his friend	5516	' She is very Irish , '

51905	51922	51900	51900	he	176	' No — she attracts too many to need the attention of a nobody like myself . '
51924	51928	51900	51900	he	176	' too many , '
52057	52072	52049	52049	he	150	' One quadrille we must have , Laura ! if you are not tired ? '
52073	52089	52049	52049	he	150	' No ! O no ! I could dance till this time to - morrow . '
52090	52097	52099	52100	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' We ought to be going , '
52102	52113	52115	52115	Guy	150	' O pray , Mrs. Edmonstone , this one more , '
52119	52126	52115	52115	Guy	150	' Laura owes me this one ! '
52127	52136	52138	52138	Laura	454	' Yes , this one more , mamma , '
52777	52790	52769	52769	he	454	' Two loving hearts may sever , For sorrow fails them never . '
52990	53000	52982	52982	Guy	150	' For sever , read , be separated , but '
53002	53007	52982	52982	Guy	150	' would n't rhyme . '
53008	53021	52982	52982	Guy	150	' I translated it into prose , and Guy made it verse , '
53025	53034	52982	52982	Guy	150	' I hope you approve of our performance . '
53035	53051	53053	53053	Philip	454	' It is that thing of Helm von Chezy , Beharre , is it not ? '
53065	53086	53059	53059	he	454	' You have rendered the spirit very well ; but you have sacrificed a good deal to your double rhymes . '
53087	53102	53104	53104	Guy	150	' Yes , those last lines are not troubled with any equality of feet , '
53106	53126	53104	53104	Guy	150	' but the repetition is half the beauty . It put me in mind of those lines of Burns — '
53154	53170	53147	53147	We	1474	' but there is a trust in these that is more touching than that despair . '
53171	53186	53188	53188	Laura	454	' Yes , the despair is ready to wish the love had never been , '
53190	53206	53188	53188	Laura	454	' It does not see the star of trust . Why did you use that word '
53208	53214	53147	53147	We	1474	' only once , Guy ? '
53215	53239	53188	53188	Laura	454	' I did not want to lose the three — faith , hope , love , — faith keeping the other two alive . '
53240	53253	53188	53188	Laura	454	' My doubt was whether it was right to have that analogy . '
53254	53257	53259	53259	Guy	150	' Surely , '
53263	53275	53259	53259	Guy	150	' that analogy must be the best part of earthly love ? '
53326	53329	53331	53331	Philip	454	' Ah ! '
53333	53372	53331	53331	Philip	454	' balls are the fashion just now . What do you say , Amy , [ he was more inclined to patronize her than any one else ] to the gaieties we are going to provide for you ? '
53373	53397	53407	53407	Guy	150	' You ! Are you going to have your new colours ? Oh ! you are not going to give us a ball ? '
53398	53405	53407	53407	Guy	150	' Well ! that is fun ! '
53409	53419	53407	53407	Guy	150	' What glory Maurice de Courcy must be in ! '
53420	53427	53429	53429	Philip	454	' He is gone to Allonby , '
53431	53458	53429	53429	Philip	454	' to announce it ; saying , he must persuade his father to put off their going to Brighton . Do you think he will succeed ? '
53459	53462	53464	53464	Laura	454	' Hardly , '
53466	53499	53464	53464	Laura	454	' poor Lady Kilcoran was so knocked up by their ball that she is the more in want of sea air . Oh , mamma ! Eva must come and stay here . '
53500	53505	53507	53508	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' That she must , '
53510	53529	53507	53508	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' that will make it easy . She is the only one who will care about the ball . '
53583	53598	53563	53563	he	454	' Well , Charlotte , did you tease Guy into showing you those verses ? '
53599	53603	53605	53605	Charlotte	277	' O yes , '
53616	53623	53605	53605	Charlotte	277	' Well , what were they ? '
53624	53641	53563	53563	he	454	' That I must n't tell . They were very pretty ; but I 've promised . '
53642	53646	53563	53563	he	454	' Promised what ? '
53647	53673	53605	53605	Charlotte	277	' Never to say anything about them . He made it a condition with me , and I assure you I am to be trusted . '
53674	53677	53679	53679	Philip	454	' Right , '
53681	53688	53679	53679	Philip	454	' I 'll ask no more . '
53689	53697	53699	53699	Charlotte	277	' It would be of no use , '
53901	53904	53924	53924	He	150	' Thalaba , '
53950	53964	53966	53966	Laura	454	' You have not been so taken up with any book since Sintram , '
53968	53974	53975	53975	he	150	' It is like Sintram , '
53978	53982	53975	53975	he	150	' Like it ? '
53983	54007	53924	53924	He	150	' So it seems to me . A strife with the powers of darkness ; the victory , forgiveness , resignation , death . '
54008	54022	54024	54024	Amy	210	' I wish you would not speak as if you were Thalaba yourself , '
54026	54035	54024	54024	Amy	210	' you bring the whole Domdaniel round us . '
54036	54052	54054	54054	Laura	454	' I am afraid he is going to believe himself Thalaba as well as Sintram , '
54056	54079	54054	54054	Laura	454	' But you know Southey did not see all this himself , and did not understand it when it was pointed out . '
54080	54087	54089	54089	Amy	210	' Do n't tell us that , '
54091	54103	54105	54105	Guy	150	' Nay , I think there is something striking in it , '
54114	54122	54105	54105	Guy	150	' but is not this ball famous ? '
54467	54479	54481	54481	he	454	' It is a long time since I have seen you , '
54486	54493	54481	54481	he	454	' An unheard - of time . '
54494	54504	54449	54449	He	454	' Still longer since we have had any conversation . '
54505	54549	54481	54481	he	454	' I was just thinking so . Not since that hot haymaking , when Guy came home . Indeed , we have had so much amusement lately that I have hardly had time for thought . Guy says we are all growing dissipated . '
54550	54568	54481	54481	he	454	' Ah ! your German , and dancing , and music , do not agree with thought . '
54569	54573	54575	54575	Laura	454	' Poor music ! '
54579	54600	54575	54575	Laura	454	' But I am ready for a lecture ; I have been feeling more like a butterfly than I like . '
54601	54660	54481	54481	he	454	' I know you think me unjust about music , and I freely confess that I can not estimate the pleasure it affords , but I doubt whether it is a safe pleasure . It forms common ground for persons who would otherwise have little in common , and leads to intimacies which occasion results never looked for . '
54661	54664	54666	54666	Laura	454	' Yes , '
54675	54699	54666	54666	Laura	454	' Laura , you complain of feeling like a butterfly . Is not that a sign that you were made for better things ? '
54700	54783	54575	54575	Laura	454	' But what can I do ? I try to read early and at night , but I ca n't prevent the fun and gaiety , and indeed I do n't think I would . It is innocent , and we never had such a pleasant summer . Charlie is so — so much more equable , and mamma is more easy about him , and I ca n't help thinking it does them all good , though I do feel idle . '
54784	54797	54799	54799	Philip	454	' It is innocent , it is right for a little while , '
54801	54854	54799	54799	Philip	454	' but your dissatisfaction proves that you are superior to such things . Laura , what I fear is , that this summer holiday may entangle you , and so fix your fate as to render your life no holiday . O Laura ! take care ; know what you are doing ! '
54855	54861	54863	54863	Laura	454	' What am I doing ? '
54897	54902	54903	54903	he	454	' I must speak , '
54906	54937	54903	54903	he	454	' because no one else will . Have you reflected whither this may tend ? This music , this versifying , this admitting a stranger so unreservedly into your pursuits ? '
54992	55037	55041	55041	his	454	' I would not say a word if he were worthy , but Laura — Laura , I have seen Locksley Hall acted once ; do not let me see it again in a way which — which would give me infinitely more pain . '
55102	55121	55122	55122	She	1499	' No ; you need never fear that . He has no such thought , I am sure . '
55132	55146	55122	55122	She	1499	' He treats us both alike ; besides , he is so young . '
55147	55154	55156	55156	Philip	454	' The mischief is not done , '
55165	55204	55156	55156	Philip	454	' I only meant to speak in time . You might let your manner go too far , you might even allow your affections to be involved without knowing it , if you were not on your guard . '
55205	55208	55210	55210	Laura	454	' Never ! '
55212	55273	55210	55210	Laura	454	' Oh , no ; I could never dream of that with Guy . I like Guy very much ; I think better of him than you do ; but oh , no ; he could never be my first and best ; I could never care for him in that way . How could you think so , Philip ? '
55274	55321	55323	55323	he	1500	' Laura , I can not but look on you with what may seem over - solicitude . Since I lost Fanny , and worse than lost Margaret , you have been my home ; my first , my most precious interest . O , Laura , '
55338	55362	55323	55323	he	1500	' could I bear to lose you , to see you thrown away or changed — you , dearest , best of all ? '
55401	55436	55398	55398	she	1501	' Do n't speak of my changing towards you . I never could ; for if there is anything to care for in me , it is you that have taught it to me . '
55510	55516	55517	55517	He	1500	' What have I done ? '
55589	55624	55574	55574	His	1500	' Laura , my own ! ( what delight the words gave her , ) you have made me very happy . We know each other now , and trust each other for ever . '
55625	55641	55691	55691	she	1504	' O yes , yes ; nothing can alter what has grown up with us . '
55642	55648	55650	55650	Philip	454	' It is for ever ! '
55652	55685	55650	55650	Philip	454	' But , Laura , let us be content with our own knowledge of what we are to each other . Do not let us call in others to see our happiness . '
55715	55729	55731	55731	she	1504	' I never can bear to talk about the best kinds of happiness , '
55733	55737	55739	55739	she	1504	' but oh ! '
55743	55748	55739	55739	she	1504	' here they come . '
56217	56225	56227	56227	Philip	454	' What did you think of it ? '
56231	56260	56262	56262	Guy	150	' They should keep better time ! Really , Philip , there is one fellow with a bugle that ought to be flogged every day of his life ! '
56354	56355	56331	56331	he	150	' '
56368	56372	56361	56362	that boy	1521	' thought Philip . '
56390	56578	56579	56579	Joyce	300	' Scott . How was it meantime with Laura ? The others were laughing and talking round her , but all seemed lost in the transcendent beam that had shone out on her . To be told by Philip that she was all to him that he had always been to her ! This one idea pervaded her — too glorious , too happy for utterance , almost for distinct thought . The softening of his voice and the look with which he had regarded her , recurred again and again , startling her with a sudden surprise of joy almost as at the first moment . Of the future Laura thought not . Never had a promise of love been made with less knowledge of what it amounted to ; it seemed merely an expression of sentiments that she had never been without ; for had she not always looked up to Philip more than any other living creature , and gloried in being his favourite cousin ? Ever since the time when he explained to her the plates in the Encyclopaedia , and made her read '
56584	56871	56872	56872	Laura	454	' when Amy took fright at the first page . That this might lead further did not occur to her ; she was eighteen ; she had no experience , not even in novels ; she did not know what she had done ; and , above all , she had so learnt to surrender her opinions to Philip , and to believe him always right , that she would never have dreamt of questioning wherever he might choose to lead her . Even the caution of secrecy did not alarm her , though she wondered that he thought it required , safe as his confidence always was with her . Mrs. Edmonstone had been so much occupied by Charles 's illness , as to have been unable to attend to her daughters in their girlish days ; and in the governess 's time the habit had been disused of flying at once to her with every joy or grief . Laura 's thoughts were not easy of access , and Philip had long been all in all to her . She was too ignorant of life to perceive that it was her duty to make this conversation known ; or , more truly , she did not awaken her mind to consider that anything could be wrong that Philip desired . On coming home , she ran up to her own room , and , sitting by the open window , gave herself up to that delicious dream of new - found joy . There she still sat when Amy came in , opening the door softly , and treading lightly and airily as she entered , bringing two or three roses of different tints . '
56879	56880	56872	56872	Laura	454	' '
56885	56886	56872	56872	Laura	454	' '

56971	56972	56965	56965	Eveleen	244	' '
56977	57007	56965	56965	Eveleen	244	' said Laura , starting up , and laughing with a slight degree of constraint , which caused Amy , who was helping her to dress , to exclaim , '
57014	57015	57012	57012	Laura	454	' '
57021	57022	57023	57023	I	0	' '
57067	57068	57074	57074	you	454	' '
57088	57089	57083	57083	I	0	' '
57092	57447	57083	57083	I	0	' Amy never thought of entering into Philip 's talks with Laura , and was perfectly satisfied . By this time Laura was herself again , come back to common life , and resolved to watch over her intercourse with Guy ; since , though she was convinced that all was safe at present , she had Philip 's word for it that there might be danger in continuing the pleasant freedom of their behaviour . Nothing could be more reassuring than Guy 's demeanour . His head seemed entirely full of the Thursday , and of a plan of his own for enabling Charles to go to the review . It had darted into his head while he was going over the ground with Maurice . It was so long since Charles had thought it possible to attempt any amusement away from home , and former experiments had been so unsuccessful , that it had never even occurred to him to think of it ; but he caught at the idea with great delight and eagerness . Mrs. Edmonstone seemed not to know what to say ; she had much rather that it had not been proposed ; yet it was very kind of Guy , and Charles was so anxious about it that she knew not how to oppose him . She could not bear to have Charles in a crowd , helpless as he was ; and she had an unpleasing remembrance of the last occasion when they had taken him to a flower - show , where they had lost , first Mr. Edmonstone , next the carriage , and lastly , Amy and Charlotte — all had been frightened , and Charles laid up for three days from the fatigue . Answers , however , met each objection . Charles was much stronger ; Guy 's arm would be ready for him ; Guy would find the carriage . Philip would be there to help , besides Maurice ; and whenever Charles was tired , Guy would take him home at once , without spoiling any one 's pleasure . '

57751	58739	57724	57724	he	1527	' Mrs. Edmonstone was not happy , but she had great confidence in Guy ; and her only real scruple was , that she did not think it fair to occupy him entirely with attendance on her son . She referred it to papa , which , as every one knew , was the same as yielding the point , and consoled herself by the certainty that to prevent it would be a great disappointment to both the youths . Laura was convinced that to achieve the adventure of Charles at the review , was at present at least a matter of far more prominence with Guy than anything relating to herself . All but Laura and her mother were wild about the weather , especially on Wednesday , when there was an attempt at a thunder storm . Nothing was studied but the sky ; and the conversation consisted of prognostications , reports of rises and falls of the glass , of the way weather - cocks were turning , or about to turn , of swallows flying high or low , red sunsets , and halos round the moon , until at last Guy , bursting into a merry laugh , begged Mrs. Edmonstone 's pardon for being such a nuisance , and made a vow , and kept it , that be the weather what it might , he would say not another word about it that evening ; it deserved to be neglected , for he had not been able to settle to anything all day . He might have said for many days before ; for since the last ball , and still more since Lady Eveleen had been at Hollywell , it had been one round of merriment and amusement . Scrambling walks , tea - drinkings out of doors , dances among themselves , or with the addition of the Harpers , were the order of the day . Amy , Eveleen , and Guy , could hardly come into the room without dancing , and the piano was said to acknowledge nothing but waltzes , polkas , and now and then an Irish jig , for the special benefit of Mr. Edmonstone 's ears . The morning was almost as much spent in mirth as the afternoon , for the dawdlings after breakfast , and before luncheon , had a great tendency to spread out and meet ; there was new music and singing to be practised , or preparations made for evening 's diversion , or councils to be held , which Laura 's absence could not break up , though it often made Amy feel how much less idle and frivolous Laura was than herself . Eveleen said the same , but she was visiting , and it was a time to be idle ; and Mr. Lascelles seemed to be of the same opinion with regard to his pupil ; for , when Guy was vexed at not having done as much work as usual , he only laughed at him for expecting to be able to go to balls , and spend a summer of gaiety , while he studied as much as at Oxford . Thursday morning was all that heart could wish , the air cooled by the thunder , and the clouds looking as if raining was foreign to their nature . Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone , their daughters , and Lady Eveleen , were packed inside and outside the great carriage , while Guy , carefully settling Charles in the low phaeton , putting in all that any one recommended , from an air - cushion to an umbrella , flourished his whip , and drove off with an air of exultation and delight . Everything went off to admiration . No one was more amused than Charles . The scene was so perfectly new and delightful to one accustomed to such a monotonous life , that the very sight of people was a novelty . Nowhere was there so much laughing and talking as in that little carriage , and whenever Mrs. Edmonstone 's anxious eyes fell upon it , she always saw Charles sitting upright with a face so full of eager interest as to banish all thought of fatigue . Happy , indeed , he was . He enjoyed the surprise of his acquaintance at meeting him ; he enjoyed Dr. Mayerne 's laugh and congratulation ; he enjoyed seeing how foolish Philip thought him , nodding to his mother and sisters , laughing at the dreadful faces Guy could not help making at any particularly discordant note of the offensive bugle ; and his capabilities rising with his spirits , he did all that the others did , walked further than he had done for years , was lifted up steps without knowing how , sat out the whole breakfast , talked to all the world , and well earned the being thoroughly tired , as he certainly was , when Guy put him into the carriage and drove him home , and still more so when Guy all but carried him up stairs , and laid him on the sofa in the dressing - room . However , his mother announced that it would have been so unnatural if he had not been fatigued , that she should have been more anxious , and , leaving him to repose , they all , except Mr. Edmonstone , who had stayed to dine at the mess , sat down to dinner . Amy came down dressed just as the carriage had been announced , and found Laura and Eveleen standing by the table , arranging their bouquets , while Guy , in the dark , behind the piano , was playing — not , as usual in such cases , the Harmonious Blacksmith , but a chant .

59543	59582	59535	59536	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Come , I have kept you waiting shamefully , but I have been consoling myself by thinking you must be well entertained , as I heard no Harmonious Blacksmith . Papa will be wondering where we are . '
59583	59593	59420	59420	Amy	210	' Oh , mamma ! Guy wo n't go . '
59594	59602	59420	59420	Amy	210	' Guy ! is anything the matter ? '

59627	59642	59420	59420	Amy	210	' Indeed I think not . Pray do n't order me , Mrs. Edmonstone . '
59643	59676	59535	59536	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' What o'clock is it , Amy ? Past ten ! Papa will be in despair ! What is to be done ? How long do you take to dress , Guy ? '

59689	59741	59685	59685	Guy	150	' Nonsense ! But if there was time I should certainly send you . Self - discipline may be carried too far , Guy . But now it ca n't be helped — I do n't know how to keep papa waiting any longer . Laura , what shall I do ? '
59742	59749	59751	59751	Guy	150	' Let me go to Charles , '

59763	59810	59685	59685	Guy	150	' Thank you ; but do n't talk , or he will be too excited . Reading would be the very thing ! It will be a pretty story to tell every one who asks for you that I have left you to nurse my son ! '

60815	60862	60813	60813	Philip	454	' It came like a thunderclap . I thought till the last moment he was joking , for he likes dancing so much ; he was the life of our ball , and how could any one suppose he would fly off at the last moment ? '
60863	60873	60788	60788	she	244	' He seems rather to enjoy doing things suddenly . '

60889	60925	60885	60885	Eveleen	244	' She has been always busy of late when we have wanted her ; and I assure her his pride has been piqued . Do n't you think that is an explanation , Captain Morville ? '
60940	60947	60948	60948	Eveleen	244	' Is n't Laura looking lovely ? '
60952	60964	60965	60965	She	244	' I am sure she is the beauty of the night ! '
60976	61016	60970	60971	Captain Morville	275	' She is even better dressed than at our ball — those Venetian pins suit the form of her head so well . Her beauty is better than almost any one 's , because she has so much countenance . '

61024	61051	61022	61022	Philip	454	' How proud Maurice looks of having her on his arm . Does not he ? Poor Maurice ! he is desperately in love with her ! '

61070	61086	61087	61087	she	244	' I see you know what we mean by being desperately in love ! No , '
61093	61126	61087	61087	she	244	' I am very glad it is only that kind of desperation . One could not think of Maurice and Laura together . He does not know the best part of Laura . '

61179	61185	61187	61187	Laura	454	' It is not that , '
61196	61209	61187	61187	Laura	454	' It is the only motive that could excuse his extraordinary behaviour . '
61210	61233	61153	61153	He	275	' Surely you know he says that he is growing unsettled . It is part of his rule of self - discipline . '
61234	61306	61153	61153	He	275	' Absurd!—exaggerated!—incredible ! This is the same story as there was about the horse . It is either caprice or temper , and I am convinced that some change in your manner — nay , I say unconscious , and am far from blaming you — is the cause . Why else did he devote himself to Charles , and leave you all on my uncle 's hands in the crowd ? '
61307	61318	61153	61153	He	275	' We could shift for ourselves much better than Charlie . '
61319	61379	61153	61153	He	275	' This confirms my belief that my warning was not mistimed . I wish it could have been done without decidedly mortifying him and rousing his temper , because I am sorry others should be slighted ; but if he takes your drawing back so much to heart , it shows that it was time you should do so .

61403	61443	61153	61153	He	275	' O , that is only Eveleen 's nonsense ! The only difference , I am conscious of having made , was keeping more up stairs , and not trying to persuade him to come here to - night . '
61444	61476	61153	61153	He	275	' I have no doubt it was this that turned the scale . He only waited for persuasion , and you acted very wisely in not flattering his self - love . '

61486	61525	61153	61153	He	275	' A woman 's instinct is often better than reasoning , Laura ; to do the right thing without knowing why . But come , I suppose we must play our part in the pageant of the night . '

61586	61592	61153	61153	He	275	' Your going to Ireland ? '
61593	61632	61562	61562	she	1571	' Yes ; you know none of us , except papa , have seen grandmamma since Charles began to be ill , and there is some talk of his taking me with him when he goes this summer . '
61633	61661	61562	61562	she	1571	' I knew he was going , but I thought it was not to be till later in the year — not till after the long vacation . '
61662	61692	61153	61153	He	275	' So he intended , but he finds he must be at home before the end of October , and it would suit him best to go in August . '
61693	61700	61562	61562	she	1571	' Then what becomes of Guy ? '
61701	61779	61562	61562	she	1571	' He stays at Hollywell . It will be much better for Charles to have him there while papa is away . I thought when the plan was first mentioned I should be sorry , except that it is quite right to go to grandmamma ; but if it is so , about Guy , this absence would be a good thing — it would make a break , and I could begin again on different terms . '
61780	61821	61153	61153	He	275	' Wisely judged , Laura . Yes , on that account it would be very desirable , though it will be a great loss to me , and I can hardly hope to be so near you on your return . '
61822	61831	61833	61833	Laura	454	' Ah ! yes , so I feard ! '
61835	61876	61833	61833	Laura	454	' But we must give up something ; and for Guy 's own sake , poor fellow , it will be better to make a break , as you say . It will save him pain by - and by . '
61877	61924	61153	61153	He	275	' I dare say papa will consult you about when his journey is to be . His only doubt was whether it would do to leave Guy so long alone ; and if you say it would be safe , it would decide him at once . '
61925	61987	61833	61833	Laura	454	' I see little chance of mischief . Guy has few temptations here , and a strong sense of honour ; besides , I shall be at hand . Taking all things into consideration , Laura , I think that , whatever the sacrifice to ourselves , it is expedient to recommend his going at once , and your accompanying him . '
62361	62374	62355	62355	he	454	' Take care ; you must be cautious — self - command . '

When the Hollywell party met at breakfast , Charles showed himself by no means the worse for his yesterday 's experiment . He said he had gone to sleep in reasonable time , lulled by some poetry , he knew not what , of which Guy 's voice had made very pretty music , and he was now full of talk about the amusement he had enjoyed yesterday , which seemed likely to afford food for conversation for many a week to come . After all the care Guy had taken of him , Mrs. Edmonstone could not find it in her heart to scold , and her husband having spent his vexation upon her , had none left to bestow on the real culprit . So when Guy , with his bright morning face , and his hair hanging shining and wet round it , opened the dining - room door , on his return from bathing in the river , Mr. Edmonstone 's salutation only conveyed that humorous anger that no one cares for .

63160	63171	63145	63145	Guy	150	' What ! Broadstone in despair for want of me ? '

63211	63246	63195	63195	Guy	150	' O , Lady Eveleen , good morning ; you are come in good time to give me the story of the ball , for no one else tells me one word about it . '
63247	63255	63257	63257	she	1593	' Because you do n't deserve it , '
63259	63269	63257	63257	she	1593	' I hope you have repented by this time . '

63289	63315	63317	63317	Eveleen	244	' I sha'n't say one word about it ; I shall send you to Coventry , as Maurice and all the regiment mean to do , '

63349	63358	63347	63347	Charles	156	' See what the regiment say to you . '

63412	63421	63404	63404	Charles	156	' which is the worst sign of all . '

63960	63976	63930	63930	she	5168	' said Guy , murmuring low , as if trying to find the real indictment ; '

64100	64158	64094	64094	you	1612	' I told him how it was , and he said he was glad that was all , and advised me to go and call on Colonel Deane and explain . I thought that the best way — indeed , I meant it before , and was walking to his lodgings when Maurice de Courcy met me . '

64233	64308	64336	64336	he	0	' I tried to get at the rights of it , but he is such a harum - scarum fellow there was no succeeding . Next I met Thorndale , who only bowed and passed on the other side of the street — sign enough how it was with Philip ; so I thought it best to go at once to the Captain , and get a rational account of what was the matter . '
64309	64313	64315	64315	Amy	210	' Did you ? '
64346	64359	64336	64336	he	0	' Yes . Philip was at home , and very — very — '
64360	64363	64365	64365	Amy	210	' Gracious ? '
64374	64461	64365	64365	Amy	210	' Just so . Only the vexatious thing was , that we never could succeed in coming to an understanding . He was ready to forgive ; but I could not disabuse him of an idea — where he picked it up I can not guess — that I had stayed away out of pique . He would not even tell me what he thought had affronted me , though I asked him over and over again to be only straightforward ; he declared I knew . '
64462	64467	64469	64469	Amy	210	' How excessively provoking ! '
64471	64480	64469	64469	Amy	210	' You can not guess what he meant ? '
64481	64540	64336	64336	he	0	' Not the least in the world . I have not the most distant suspicion . It was of no use to declare I was not offended with any one ; he only looked in that way of his , as if he knew much better than I did myself , and told me he could make allowances . '
64541	64551	64336	64336	he	0	' Worse than all ! How horrid of him . '
64552	64612	64336	64336	he	0	' No , do n't spoil me . No doubt he thinks he has grounds , and my irritation was unjustifiable . Yes , I got into my old way . He cautioned me , and nearly made me mad ! I never was nearer coming to a regular outbreak . Always the same ! Fool that I am . '
64613	64649	64469	64469	Amy	210	' Now , Guy , that is always your way ; when other people are provoking , you abuse yourself . I am sure Philip was so , with his calm assertion of being right . '
64650	64661	64336	64336	he	0	' The more provoking , the more trial for me . '
64662	64687	64336	64336	he	0	' But you endured it . You say it was only nearly an outbreak . You parted friends ? I am sure of that . '
64688	64703	64469	64469	Amy	210	' Yes , it would have been rather too bad not to do that . '
64704	64719	64469	64469	Amy	210	' Then why do you scold yourself , when you really had the victory ? '
64720	64739	64336	64336	he	0	' The victory will be if the inward feeling as well as the outward token is ever subdued . '
64740	64764	64469	64469	Amy	210	' O , that must be in time , of course . Only let me hear how you got on with Colonel Deane . '
64765	64824	64469	64469	Amy	210	' He was very good - natured , and would have laughed it off , but Philip went with me , and looked grand , and begged in a solemn way that no more might be said . I could have got on better alone ; but Philip was very kind , or as you say , gracious . '
64825	64829	64831	64831	Amy	210	' And provoking , '
64833	64846	64831	64831	Amy	210	' only I believe you do not like me to say so . '
64847	64880	64469	64469	Amy	210	' It is more agreeable to hear you call him so at this moment than is good for me . I have no right to complain , since I gave the offence . '
64881	64885	64469	64469	Amy	210	' The offence ? '
64886	64891	64469	64469	Amy	210	' The absenting myself . '
64892	64904	64469	64469	Amy	210	' Oh ! that you did because you thought it right . '
64905	64916	64469	64469	Amy	210	' I want to be clear that it was right . '
64917	64923	64925	64925	she	210	' What do you mean ? '
64929	64951	64925	64925	she	210	' It was a great piece of selfdenial , and I only felt it wrong not to be doing the same . '
64952	64968	64969	64969	She	210	' Nay , how should such creatures as you need the same discipline as I ? '
65031	65097	65027	65027	He	1619	' Something wrong I have done , and I want the clue . Was it self - will in choosing discipline contrary to your mother 's judgment ? Yet she could not know all . I thought it her kindness in not liking me to lose the pleasure . Besides , one must act for oneself , and this was only my own personal amusement . '
65098	65101	65103	65103	Amy	210	' Yes , '
65108	65111	65113	65113	he	1619	' Well ? '
65133	65136	65138	65138	he	1619	' Well ? '
65161	65169	65171	65171	Amy	210	' I was thinking of one thing , '
65173	65194	65171	65171	Amy	210	' is it not sometimes right to consider whether we ought to disappoint people who want us to be pleased ? '
65195	65203	65205	65205	Guy	150	' There it is , I believe , '
65220	65259	65205	65205	Guy	150	' that is a real rule . Not to be so bent on myself as to sacrifice other people 's feelings to what seems best for me . But I do n't see whose pleasure I interfered with . '
65264	65267	65171	65171	Amy	210	' Mine ; '
65280	65289	65277	65277	she	210	' We all thought you would like it . '
65290	65336	65171	65171	Amy	210	' And I had no right to sacrifice your pleasure ! I see , I see . The pleasure of giving pleasure to others is so much the best there is on earth , that one ought to be passive rather than interfere with it . '
65337	65340	65342	65342	Amy	210	' Yes , '
65344	65374	65277	65277	she	210	' just as I have seen Mary Ross let herself be swung till she was giddy , rather than disappoint Charlotte and Helen , who thought she liked it . '
65375	65430	65171	65171	Amy	210	' If one could get to look at everything with as much indifference as the swinging ! But it is all selfishness . It is as easy to be selfish for one 's own good as for one 's own pleasure ; and I daresay , the first is as bad as the other . '
65431	65439	65441	65441	Amy	210	' I was thinking of something else , '
65443	65500	65441	65441	Amy	210	' I should think it more like the holly tree in Southey . Do n't you know it ? The young leaves are sharp and prickly , because they have so much to defend themselves from , but as the tree grows older , it leaves off the spears , after it has won the victory . '
65501	65513	65515	65515	he	1620	' Very kind of you , and very pretty , Amy , '
65519	65559	65515	65515	he	1620	' but in the meantime , it is surely wrong to be more prickly than is unavoidable , and there is the perplexity . Selfish ! selfish ! selfish ! Oneself the first object . That is the root . '
65560	65593	65595	65595	Amy	210	' Guy , if it is not impertinent to ask , I do wish you would tell me one thing . Why did you think it wrong to go to that ball ? '
65599	65616	65618	65618	Guy	150	' I do n't know that I thought it wrong to go to that individual ball , '
65620	65721	65618	65618	Guy	150	' but my notion was that altogether I was getting into a rattling idle way , never doing my proper quantity of work , or doing it properly , and talking a lot of nonsense sometimes . I thought , last Sunday , it was time to make a short turn somewhere and bring myself up . I could not , or did not get out of the pleasant talks as Laura does , so I thought giving up this ball would punish me at once , and set me on a new tack of behaving like a reasonable creature . '
65722	65752	65853	65853	Guy	150	' Do n't call yourself too many names , or you wo nt be civil to us . We all , except Laura , have been quite as bad . '
65753	65765	65618	65618	Guy	150	' Yes ; but you had not so much to do . '
65766	65770	65772	65772	Amy	210	' We ought , '
65774	65786	65772	65772	Amy	210	' but I meant to be reasonable when Eveleen is gone . '
65787	65835	65837	65837	he	1621	' Perhaps I ought to have waited till then , but I do n't know . Lady Eveleen is so amusing that it leads to farther dawdling , and it would not to do to wait to resist the temptation till it is out of the way . '
65915	65949	65961	65961	Guy	150	' If it was not you , Guy , who made that speech , I should call it fishing for a compliment . You forget that rank and station make people sought after . '
65950	65959	65961	65961	Guy	150	' I suppose there is something in that , '
65965	65984	65961	65961	Guy	150	' at any rate , it is no bad thing to think so , it is so humiliating . '
65985	65997	65961	65961	Guy	150	' That is not the way most people would take it . '
65998	66051	65961	65961	Guy	150	' No ? Does not it prevent one from taking any attention as paid to one 's real self ? The real flattering thing would be to be made as much of , as Philip is , for one 's own merits , and not for the handle to one 's name . '
66052	66059	66061	66061	Amy	210	' Yes , I think so , '
66063	66068	66071	66071	he	1621	' Well , then , '
66082	66151	66071	66071	he	1621	' the point is to consider whether abstaining from innocent things that may be dangerous to oneself mortifies other people . If so , the vexing them is a certain wrong , whereas the mischief of taking the pleasure is only a possible contingency . But then , one must take it out of oneself some other way , or it becomes an excuse for self - indulgence . '
66152	66157	66159	66160	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Hardly with you , '
66164	66211	66159	66160	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Because I had rather go at it at once , and forget all about other people . You must teach me consideration , Mrs. Edmonstone , and in the meantime , will you tell me what you think I had better do about this scrape ? '
66212	66217	66219	66220	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Let it alone , '
66222	66301	66219	66220	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' You have begged every one 's pardon , and it had better be forgotten as fast as possible . They have made more fuss already than it is worth . Do n't torment yourself about it any more ; for , if you have made a mistake , it is on the right side ; and on the first opportunity , I 'll go and call on Mrs. Deane , and see if she is very implacable . '
66370	66376	66378	66379	poor Laura	454	' Ca n't he guess ? '
66393	66421	66378	66379	poor Laura	454	' No , he has no idea , though Philip protested that he knew , and would not tell him . Philip must have been most tiresome . '

66706	66707	66675	66675	Amy	210	' '
66713	66717	66675	66675	Amy	210	' said Amy , '
66723	67166	66719	66719	I	0	' and away she ran , much puzzled , but with no desire to look into Philip 's secrets . Laura rested her head on her hand , sighed , and wondered why it was so hard to answer . She almost wished she had said Philip had been advising her to discourage any attachment on Guy 's part ; but then Amy might have laughed , and asked why . No ! no ! Philip 's confidence was in her keeping , and , cost her what it might , she would be faithful to the trust . There was now a change . The evenings were merry , but the mornings were occupied . Guy went off to his room , as he used to do last winter ; Laura commenced some complicated perspective , or read a German book with a great deal of dictionary ; Amy had a book of history , and practised her music diligently ; even Charles read more to himself , and resumed the study with Guy and Amy ; Lady Eveleen joined in every one 's pursuits , enjoyed them , and lamented to Laura that it was impossible to be rational at her own home . Laura tried to persuade her that there was no need that she should be on the level of the society round her , and it ended in her spending an hour in diligent study every morning , promising to continue it when she went home , while Laura made such sensible comments that Eveleen admired her more than ever ; and she , knowing that some were second - hand from Philip , others arising from his suggestions , gave him all the homage paid to herself , as a tribute to him who reigned over her whole being . Yet she was far from happy . Her reserve towards Guy made her feel stiff and guarded ; she had a craving for Philip 's presence , with a dread of showing it which made her uncomfortable . She wondered he had not been at Hollywell since the ball , for he must know that she was going to Ireland in a fortnight , and was not likely to return till his regiment had left Broadstone . An interval passed long enough for her not to be alone in her surprise at his absenting himself before he at length made his appearance , just before luncheon , so as to miss the unconstrained morning hours he used so much to enjoy . He found Guy , Charles , and Amy , deep in Butler 's Analogy . '
67176	67180	67168	67168	you	1627	' said he . '

67302	67342	67295	67295	your	1627	' replied Philip , in his own calm manner , though he actually felt hurt , which he had never done before . His complacency was less secure , so that there was more need for self - assertion . '
67348	67352	67353	67353	Laura	454	' he asked . '
67365	67369	67370	67370	I	0	' said Amy ; '
67378	67379	67370	67370	I	0	' '
67387	67388	67370	67370	I	0	' '
67400	67528	67392	67393	Lord Kilcoran	182	' Charlotte entered , and immediately ran up stairs to announce her cousin 's arrival . Laura was glad of this previous notice , and hoped her blush and tremor were not observed . It was a struggle , through luncheon time , to keep her colour and confusion within bounds , but she succeeded better than she fancied she did , and Philip gave her as much help as he could , by not looking at her . Seeing that he dreaded nothing so much as her exciting suspicion , she was at once braced and alarmed . Her father was very glad to see him , and reproached him for making himself a stranger , while her sisters counted up the days of his absence . '
67561	67600	67559	67559	herself	454	' Laura bent down to feed Bustle , and Philip felt his colour deepening . Mr. Edmonstone went on to ask him to come and stay at Hollywell for a week , vowing he would take no refusal . '
67609	67613	67559	67559	herself	454	' said Philip , '
67622	67856	67857	67857	I	0	' Amabel hinted that there was to be a dinner party on Thursday , thinking it fair to give him warning of what he disliked , but he immediately chose that very day . Again he disconcerted all expectations , when it was time to go out . Mrs. Edmonstone and Charles were going to drive , the young ladies and Guy to walk , but Philip disposed himself to accompany his uncle in a survey of the wheat . Laura perceived that he would not risk taking another walk with her when they might be observed . It showed implicit turst to leave her to his rival , but she was sorry to find that caution must put an end to the freedom of their intercourse , and would have stayed at home , but that Eveleen was so wild and unguarded that Mrs. Edmonstone did not like her to be without Laura as a check on her , especially when Guy was of the party . There was some comfort in that warm pressure of her hand when she bade Philip good bye , and on that she lived for a long time . He stood at the window watching them till they were out of sight , then moved towards his aunt , who , with her bonnet on , was writing an invitation for Thursday , to Mr. Thorndale . '
67861	67870	67857	67857	I	0	' said he , in a low voice , '
67892	67893	67885	67885	Thorndale	176	' '
67899	67915	67895	67895	you	0	' returned Mrs. Edmonstone , looking at him more inquiringly than he could well bear . '
67933	67934	67895	67895	you	0	' '
67944	68054	67937	67937	I	0	' said she , going in search of him . She presently returned , saying they should be very glad to see Mr. Thorndale , asking him at the same time , in her kind tones of interest , after an old servant for whom he had been spending much thought and pains . The kindness cut him to the heart , for it evidently arose from a perception that he was ill at ease , and his conscience smote him . He answered shortly , and was glad when the carriage came ; he lifted Charles into it , and stood with folded arms as they drove away . '
68060	68069	68070	68070	You	1636	' said Charles , looking back at him . '
68075	68082	68083	68083	You	1636	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , eagerly . '
68086	68087	68083	68083	You	1636	' '
68096	68097	68083	68083	You	1636	' '

68163	68173	68161	68161	himself	1637	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , in a leading tone . '
68190	68191	68175	68177	the sweet youth	1640	' '
68195	68199	68161	68161	himself	1637	' she exclaimed . '
68208	68228	68161	68161	himself	1637	' Only as a solution of phenomena ; but you look as if I had hit on the truth . '
68229	68240	68161	68161	himself	1637	' I hope it is no such thing ; yet — '
68241	68244	68246	68246	Charles	156	' Yet ? '
68250	68259	68246	68246	Charles	156	' I think he has discovered the danger . '
68260	68296	68161	68161	himself	1637	' The danger of falling in love with Laura ? Well , it would be odd if he was not satisfied with his own work . But he must know how preposterous that would be . '
68297	68306	68308	68309	his mother	612	' And you think that would prevent it ? '
68313	68346	68308	68309	his mother	612	' He is just the man to plume himself on making his judgment conquer his inclination , setting novels at defiance . How magnanimously he would resolve to stifle a hopeless attachment ! '
68347	68441	68161	68161	himself	1637	' That is exactly what I think he is doing . I think he has found out the state of his feelings , and is doing all in his power to check them by avoiding her , especially in tête - à - têtes , and an unconstrained family party . I am nearly convinced that is his reason for bringing Mr. Thorndale and fixing on the day of the dinner . Poor fellow , it must cost him a great deal , and I long to tell him how I thank him . '
68442	68452	68454	68454	Charles	156	' How ! I do n't think it unlikely , '
68456	68575	68454	68454	Charles	156	' It agrees with what happened the evening of the Kilcoran ball , when he was ready to eat me up for saying something he fancied was a hint of a liking of Guy 's for Laura . It was a wild mistake , from something I said about Petrarch , forgetting that Petrarch suggested Laura ; but it put him out to a degree , and he made all manner of denunciations on the horror of Guy 's falling in love with her . Now , as far as I see , Guy is much more in love with you , or with Deloraine , and the idea argues far more that the Captain himself is touched . '
68576	68610	68161	68161	himself	1637	' Depend upon it , Charlie , it was this that led to his detecting the true state of the case . Ever since that he has kept away . It is noble ! '
68611	68620	68161	68161	himself	1637	' And what do you think about Laura ? '
68621	68649	68454	68454	Charles	156	' Poor child ! I doubt if it was well to allow so much intimacy ; yet I do n't see how it could have been helped . '
68650	68673	68161	68161	himself	1637	' So you think she is in for it ? I hope not ; but she has not been herself of late . '
68674	68749	68161	68161	himself	1637	' I think she misses what she has been used to from him , and thinks him estranged , but I trust it goes no further . I see she is out of spirits ; I wish I could help her , dear girl , but the worst of all would be to let her guess the real name and meaning of all this , so I ca n't venture to say a word . '
68750	68758	68760	68760	Charles	156	' She is very innocent of novels , '
68762	68781	68760	68760	Charles	156	' and that is well . It would be an unlucky business to have our poor beauty either sitting '
68788	68789	68783	68783	Patience	308	' '
68798	68833	68161	68161	himself	1637	' But that will never be . Philip is not the man to have a wife in barracks . He would have her like his books , in morocco , or not at all . '
68834	68892	68783	68783	Patience	308	' He would never involve her in discomforts . He may be entirely trusted , and as long as he goes on as he has begun , there is no harm done ; Laura will cheer up , will only consider him as her cousin and friend , and never know he has felt more for her . '
68893	68902	68783	68783	Patience	308	' Her going to Ireland is very fortunate . '
68903	68920	68161	68161	himself	1637	' It has made me still more glad that the plan should take place at once . '
68921	68925	68783	68783	Patience	308	' And you say '
68930	68931	68161	68161	himself	1637	'' '
68968	69434	69435	69435	Lily	309	' It may be wondered at that Mrs. Edmonstone should confide such a subject to her son , but she knew that in a case really affecting his sister , and thus introduced , his silence was secure . In fact , confidence was the only way to prevent the shrewd , unscrupulous raillery which would have caused great distress , and perhaps led to the very disclosure to be deprecated . Of late , too , there had been such a decrease of petulance in Charles , as justified her in trusting him ; and , lastly , it must be observed that she was one of those openhearted people who can not make a discovery nor endure an anxiety without imparting it . Her tact , indeed , led her to make a prudent choice of confidants , and , in this case her son was by far the best , though she had spoken without premeditation . Her nature would never have allowed her to act as her daughter was doing ; she would have been without the strength to conceal her feelings , especially when deprived of the safety - valve of free intercourse with their object . The visit took place as arranged , and very uncomfortable it was to all who looked deeper than the surface . In the first place , Philip found there the last person he wished his friend to meet — Lady Eveleen , who had been persuaded to stay for the dinner party ; but Mr. Thorndale was , as Charles would have said , on his good behaviour , and , ashamed of the fascination her manners exercised over him , was resolved to resist it , answered her gay remarks with brief sentences and stiff smiles , and consorted chiefly with the gentlemen . Laura was grave and silent , trying to appear unconscious , and only succeeding in being visibly constrained . Philip was anxious and stern in his attempts to appear unconcerned , and even Guy was not quite as bright and free as usual , being puzzled as to how far he was forgiven about the ball . Amabel could not think what had come to every one , and tried in vain to make them sociable . In the evening they had recourse to a game , said to be for Charlotte 's amusement , but in reality to obviate some of the stiffness and constraint ; yet even this led to awkward situations . Each person was to set down his or her favourite character in history and fiction , flower , virtue , and time at which to have lived , and these were all to be appropriated to the writers . The first read was — '
69453	69454	69455	69455	Amy	210	' '
69457	69461	69455	69455	Amy	210	' exclaimed Guy . '
69468	69472	69464	69464	you	210	' said Charles ; '
69479	69480	69481	69482	Padre Cristoforo	311	' '
69484	69489	69481	69482	Padre Cristoforo	311	' was the answer . '
69498	69502	69503	69503	she	210	' said Eveleen , '
69513	69514	69503	69503	she	210	' '
69533	69537	69527	69527	her	310	' said Amy . '

69555	69559	69538	69538	You	1650	' cried Guy . '

69611	69656	69597	69597	I	0	' What was it that made Guy 's brow contract , as he began to strip the feather of a pen , till , recollecting himself , he threw it from him with a dash , betraying some irritation , and folded his hands . '
69659	69663	69597	69597	I	0	' read Charlotte . '
69672	69676	69677	69677	I	0	' cried Eveleen . '
69680	69688	69689	69689	I	0	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , looking up . '
69704	69725	69689	69689	I	0	' Philip smiled . Charlotte proceeded , and Charles saw Laura 's colour deepening as she bent over her work . '
69735	69738	69732	69732	Cordelia	312	' King Lear '
69744	69748	69750	69750	Charlotte	277	' How funny ! '
69752	69758	69750	69750	Charlotte	277	' For hear the next ; '
69772	69786	69787	69787	Laura	454	' Why , Laura , you must have copied it from Philip 's . '
69834	69890	69817	69817	Charles	156	' and as Charlotte paused , as if to make some dangerous remark , he caught the paper , and read the next himself . Nothing so startled Philip as this desire to cover their confusion . Laura was only sensible of the relief of having attention drawn from her by the laugh that followed . '
69901	69921	69817	69817	Charles	156	' blue moulded for want of a bating'—Pat Riotism — the time of Malachy with the collar of gold . '

69929	69932	69934	69934	Eveleen	244	' Nonsense , '
69936	69952	69934	69934	Eveleen	244	' I am glad I know your tastes , Charles . They do you honour . '
69953	69964	69966	69966	Charles	156	' More than yours do , if these are yours , '
69972	69987	69966	69966	Charles	156	' Rose — generosity — Charles Edward — Catherine Seyton — the civil wars . '
69988	70001	70003	70003	Guy	150	' You had better not have disowned Charlie 's , Lady Eveleen ? '
70005	70022	70024	70024	Charles	315	' Nay , do you think I would put up with such a set as these ? '
70026	70041	70024	70024	Charles	315	' I am not fallen so low as the essence of young - ladyism . '
70042	70052	70054	70054	Eveleen	244	' What can you find to say against them ? '
70056	70059	70061	70061	Charles	315	' Nothing , '
70063	70077	70061	70061	Charles	315	' No one ever can find anything to say for or against young ladies '

70095	70099	70093	70093	yourself	150	' said Guy , '

70119	70123	70061	70061	Charles	315	' said Amy , '

70217	70221	70213	70213	Sir	150	' exclaimed Charles . '

70315	70323	70305	70306	no one	567	' cried Guy , indignantly , then ; '

70368	70372	70416	70416	You	150	' said Philip ; '

70465	70474	70459	70459	You	150	' said Guy , striving to speak patiently . '
70494	70495	70459	70459	You	150	' '

70549	70638	70545	70545	his	1667	' Charles laughed ; Guy pushed back his chair , and went to look out at the window . Perhaps Philip enjoyed thus chafing his temper ; for after all he had said to Laura , it was satisfactory to see his opinion justified , so that he might not feel himself unfair . It relieved his uneasiness lest his understanding with Laura should be observed . It had been in great peril that evening , for as the girls went up to bed , Eveleen gaily said , '
70650	70651	70647	70648	Captain Morville	275	' '
70664	70673	70659	70659	Eva	281	' And Laura escaped into her own room . '
70683	70687	70681	70681	Amy	210	' pursued Eveleen . '
70696	70700	70689	70690	a stranger	5901	' said Amy . '
70717	70724	70715	70715	you	454	' said Eveleen , running away . '
70730	70737	70728	70728	Eva	281	' said Amy , pursuing her ; '

71114	71123	71094	71094	you	281	' Amy had a very persuasive way of saying '
71126	71412	71094	71094	you	281	' and Eveleen thought she must yield to it . Besides , she respected Laura and Captain Morville too much to resolve to laugh at them , whatever she might do when her fear of the Captain made her saucy . Mrs. Edmonstone thought it best on all accounts to sit in the drawing - room the next morning ; but she need not have taken so much pains to chaperon her young ladies , for the gentlemen did not come near them . Laura was more at ease in manner , though very far from happy , for she was restlessly eager for a talk with Philip ; while he was resolved not to seek a private interview , sure that it would excite suspicion , and willing to lose the consciousness of his underhand proceedings . This was the day of the dinner - party , and Laura 's heart leapt as she calculated that it must fall to Philip 's lot to hand her in to dinner . She was not mistaken , he did give her his arm ; and they found themselves most favourably placed , for Philip 's other neighbour was Mrs. Brownlow , talking at a great rate to Mr. de Courcy , and on Laura 's side was the rather deaf Mr. Hayley , who had quite enough to do to talk to Miss Brownlow . Charles was not at table , and not one suspicious eye could rest on them ; yet it was not till the second course was in progress that he said anything which the whole world might not have heard . Something had passed about Canterbury , and its distance from Hollywell . '

71865	71887	72278	72278	Guy	150	' Philip , with all his sense , was mystifying himself , because he was departing from right , the only true '
71891	72274	72275	72275	he	1687	' His right judgment in all things was becoming obscured , so he talked metaphysical jargon instead of plain practical truth , and thought he was teaching Laura to strengthen her powers of mind , instead of giving way to dreams , when he was only leading her to stifle meditation , and thus securing her complete submission to himself . She was happier after this conversation , and better able to pay attention to the guests , nor did she feel guilty when obliged to play and sing in the evening — for she knew he must own that she could do no otherwise . Lady Eveleen gave , however , its brilliancy to the party . She had something wonderfully winning and fascinating about her , and Philip owned to himself that it took no small resolution on the part of Mr. Thorndale to keep so steadily aloof from the party in the bay window where she was reigning like a queen , and inspiring gaiety like a fairy . She made Guy sing with her ; it was the first time he had ever sung , except among themselves , as Mrs. Edmonstone had never known whether he would like to be asked ; but Eveleen refused to sing some of the Irish melodies unless he would join her , and without making any difficulty he did so . Mrs. Brownlow professed to be electrified , and Eveleen , declaring that she knew she sung like a peacock , told Mrs. Brownlow that the thing to hear was Sir Guy singing glees with Laura and Amy . Of course , they were obliged to sing . Mrs. Brownlow was delighted ; and as she had considerable knowledge of music , they all grew eager ; and Philip thought it very foolish of Guy to allow so much of his talent and enthusiasm to display themselves . When all the people were gone , and the home party had wished each other good night , Philip lingered in the drawing - room to finish a letter . Guy , after helping Charles up stairs , came down a few moments after , to fetch something which he had forgotten . Philip looked up,—'You contributed greatly to the entertainment this evening , '
72299	72314	72316	72316	Philip	454	' You think one devoid of the sixth sense has no right to speak , '
72318	72345	72347	72347	Guy	150	' I ca n't expect all to think it , as I do , one of the best things in this world or out of it , '
72352	72366	72368	72368	Philip	454	' I know it is so felt by those who understand its secrets , '
72370	72420	72368	72368	Philip	454	' I would not depreciate it ; so you may hear me patiently , Guy . I only meant to warn you , that it is often the means of bringing persons into undesirable intimacies , from which they can not disentangle themselves as easily as they enter them . '
72443	72637	72433	72433	he	150	' Philip looked after him , and pondered on what it was that had annoyed him — manner , words , or advice . He ascribed it to Guy 's unwillingness to be advised , since he had observed that his counsel was apt to irritate him , though his good sense often led him to follow it . In the present case , Philip thought Mrs. Brownlow and her society by no means desirable for a youth like Guy ; and he was quite right . Philip and his friend went the next morning ; and in the afternoon Laura received the book of algebra,—a very original first gift from a lover . It came openly , with a full understanding that she was to use it by his recommendation ; her mother and brother both thought they understood the motive , which one thought very wise , and the other very characteristic . Lord Kilcoran and Lady Eveleen also departed . Eveleen very sorry to go , though a little comforted by the prospect of seeing Laura so soon in Ireland , where she would set her going in all kinds of '

72654	72668	72433	72433	he	150	' said Charles , when all were out of hearing but his mother ; '
72689	72690	72682	72684	Sir Guy Morville	150	' '
72698	72703	72682	72684	Sir Guy Morville	150	' said his mother ; '
72714	72715	72706	72708	a nice creature	1688	' '
72726	72727	72720	72720	they	1689	' '
72733	72738	72720	72720	they	1689	' said Mrs. Edmonstone ; '

72912	73064	72904	72904	Charlie	149	' Burns . In another week Mr. Edmonstone and his eldest daughter were to depart on their Irish journey . Laura , besides the natural pain in leaving home , was sorry to be no longer near Philip , especially as it was not likely that he would be still at Broadstone on their return ; yet she was so restless and dissatisfied , that any change was welcome , and the fear of betraying herself almost took away the pleasure of his presence . He met them at the railway - station at Broadstone , where Mr. Edmonstone , finding himself much too early , recollected something he had forgotten in the town , and left his daughter to walk up and down the platform under Philip 's charge . They felt it a precious interval , but both were out of spirits , and could hardly profit by it . '
73075	73079	73065	73065	You	1694	' said Laura . '

73483	73591	73480	73481	your father	652	' Mr. Edmonstone returned , out of breath , in too much bustle to remark his daughter 's blushes . Even when the train was moving off , he still had his head out at the window , calling to Philip that they should expect a visit from him as soon as ever they returned . Such cordiality gave Philip a pang ; and in bitterness of spirit he walked back to the barracks . On the way he met Mrs. Deane , who wanted to consult him about inviting his cousin , Sir Guy , to a dinner - party she intended to give next week . '
73620	73621	73608	73608	he	1702	' '
73633	73634	73625	73625	he	1702	' '
73657	73658	73661	73661	he	1702	' '

73727	74207	73717	73717	him	1702	' These words brought into contrast in Philip 's mind the difference between Guy 's position and his own . The mere possession of wealth was winning for Guy , at an age when his merits could only be negative , that estimation which his own tried character had scarcely achieved , placing him not merely on a level with himself , but in a situation where happiness and influence came unbidden . His own talent , attainments , and equal , if not superior claims , to gentle blood , could not procure him what seemed to lie at Guy 's feet . His own ability and Laura 's heart alone were what wealth could not affect , yet when he thought how the want of it wasted the one , and injured the hopes of the other , he recurred to certain visions of his sister Margaret 's , in days gone by , of what he was to do as Sir Philip , lord of Redcliffe . He was speculating on what would have happened had Guy died in his sickly infancy , when , suddenly recollecting himself , he turned his mind to other objects . Guy was not much charmed with Mrs. Deane 's invitation . He said he knew he must go , to make up for his rudeness about the ball ; but he grumbled enough to make Mrs. Edmonstone laugh at him for being so stupid as to want to stay hum - drum in the chimney corner . No doubt it was very pleasant there . There was that peculiar snugness which belongs to a remnant of a large party , when each member of it feels bound to prevent the rest from being dull . Guy devoted himself to Charles more than ever , and in the fear that he might miss the late variety of amusement , exerted even more of his powers of entertainment than Lady Eveleen had called forth . There were grave readings in the mornings , and long walks in the afternoons , when he dragged Charles , in his chair , into many a place he had never expected to see again , and enabled him to accompany his mother and sisters in many a delightful expedition . In the evening there was music , or light reading , especially poetry , as this was encouraged by Mrs. Edmonstone , in the idea that it was better that so excitable and enthusiastic a person as Guy should have his objects of admiration tested by Charles 's love of ridicule . Mr. Edmonstone had left to Guy the office of keeping the 1st of September , one which he greatly relished . Indeed , when he thought of his own deserted manors , he was heard to exclaim , in commiseration for the neglect , '
74211	74407	73717	73717	him	1702	' The Hollywell shooting was certainly not like that at Redclyffe , where he could hardly walk out of his own grounds , whereas here he had to bear in mind so many boundaries , that Philip was expecting to have to help him out of some direful scrape . He had generally walked over the whole extent , and assured himself that the birds were very wild , and Bustle the best of dogs , before breakfast , so as to be ready for all the occupations of the day . He could scarcely be grateful when the neighbours , thinking it must be very dull for him to be left alone with Mrs. Edmonstone and her crippled son , used to ask him to shoot or dine . He always lamented at first , and ended by enjoying himself . One night , he came home in such a state of eagerness , that he must needs tell his good news ; and , finding no one in the drawing - room , he ran up - stairs , opened Charles 's door , and exclaimed,—'There 's to be a concert at Broadstone ! '
74575	74596	74598	74598	he	454	' Hollo , Morville ! how are you ? So you have great doings to - night , I hear ! '
74623	74637	74638	74638	He	454	' I beg your pardon , sir , but the ties of relationship — '
74657	74660	74662	74662	he	454	' Sir ! '
74689	74702	74664	74678	a thin , foreign - looking man , in a somewhat flashy style of dress	1711	' I beg your pardon — Sir Guy Morville , I believe ? '
74703	74709	74662	74662	he	454	' Captain Morville , sir . '
74710	74723	74725	74725	he	454	' I beg your pardon — I mistook . A thousand pardons , '
74892	74920	74886	74887	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' It must be my uncle!—I am sure it must . I 'll ride to Broadstone the first thing to - morrow , and find him out . '
74921	74925	74927	74928	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Your uncle ! '
74930	74937	74927	74928	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I never thought of that . '
74938	74943	74945	74945	Guy	150	' S. B. Dixon ! '
74947	74994	74945	74945	Guy	150	' I know his name is Sebastian . It can not be any one else . You know he went to America . How curious it is ! I suppose there is no fear of his being gone before I can come in to - morrow ? '
74995	75008	74927	74928	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I should think not . Those musical people keep late hours . '
75009	75055	75065	75065	herself	159	' I would go before breakfast . Perhaps it would be best to go to old Redford , he will know all about him ; or to the music - shop . I am so glad ! It is the very thing I always wished . '
75056	75060	75062	75063	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Did you ? '
75067	75182	75183	75183	She	1716	' I ca n't say every one would be of your mind ; but I ca n't help liking you the better for it . I wish the man had kept further off . I wish Mr. Edmonstone was at home . I hope no harm will come of it . I wonder what I ought to do . Shall I caution him ? No ; I do n't think I can spoil his happiness — and perhaps the man may be improved . He is his nearest relation , and I have no right to interfere . His own good sense will protect him — but I wish Mr. Edmonstone was at home . '
75275	75283	75255	75255	he	1717	' See here — it is himself ! '
75284	75287	75255	75255	he	1717	' Who ? '
75288	75299	75255	75255	he	1717	' My uncle . My poor mother 's own brother . '
75300	75305	75307	75307	Philip	454	' Sebastian Bach Dixon , '
75309	75322	75255	75255	he	1717	' Ha ! it was he who took me for you yesterday . '
75323	75364	75255	75255	he	1717	' I saw him at the concert — I was sure it could be no other . I came in on purpose to find him , and here he is waiting for me . Is not it a happy chance ? '
75365	75368	75370	75370	Philip	454	' Happy ! '
75378	75443	75445	75445	Guy	150	' How I have longed for this — for any one who could remember and tell me of her — of my mother — my poor , dear young mother ! And her own brother ! I have been thinking of it all night , and he knows I am here , and is as eager as myself . He is waiting for me , '
75450	75453	75455	75455	Philip	454	' Stop ! '
75459	75492	75455	75455	Philip	454	' Think before acting . I seriously advise you to have nothing to do with this man , at least personally . Let me see him , and learn what he wants . '
75493	75498	75501	75501	Guy	150	' He wants me , '
75503	75510	75501	75501	Guy	150	' You are not his nephew . '
75511	75515	75517	75517	Philip	454	' Thank heaven ! '
75519	75534	75517	75517	Philip	454	' Do you imagine your relationship is the sole cause of his seeking you ? '
75535	75546	75548	75548	Guy	150	' I do n't know — I do n't care ! '
75553	75566	75548	75548	Guy	150	' I will not listen to suspicions of my mother 's brother . '
75567	75612	75517	75517	Philip	454	' It is more than suspicion . Hear me calmly . I speak for your good . I know this man 's influence was fatal to your father . I know he did all in his power to widen the breach with your grandfather . '
75613	75620	75622	75622	Guy	150	' That was eighteen years ago , '
75637	75708	75628	75628	his	150	' You will not hear . Remember , that his position and associates render him no fit companion for you . Nay , listen patiently . You can not help the relationship . I would not have you do otherwise than assist him . Let him not complain of neglect , but be on your guard . He will either seriously injure you , or be a burden for life . '
75709	75723	75725	75725	Guy	150	' I have heard you so far — I can hear no more , '
75733	75769	75770	75770	He	150	' He is my uncle , that I know ; I care for nothing else . Position — nonsense ! what has that to do with it ? I will not be set against him . '
75788	75814	75783	75783	Philip	454	' Thank you for your advice . I beg your pardon for my hastiness . You mean kindly , but I must see my uncle . '
75852	75862	75830	75830	he	150	' I am so glad!—I hoped it was you ! '
75863	75892	75894	75895	Mr. Dixon	255	' It is very noble - hearted ! I might have known it would be so with the son of my dearest sister and of my generous friend ! '
75917	75925	75927	75927	Guy	150	' I saw your name last night , '
75929	75960	75927	75927	Guy	150	' I would have tried to speak to you at once , but I was obliged to stay with Mrs. Edmonstone , as I was the only gentleman with her . '
75961	75996	75997	75997	Guy	150	' Ah ! I thought it possible you might not be able to follow the dictates of your own heart ; but this is a fortunate conjuncture , in the absence of your guardian . '
76029	76038	76039	76039	he	150	' How did you know I was here ? '
76042	76117	76039	76039	he	150	' I learnt it in a most gratifying way . Mr. Redford , without knowing our connexion — for on that I will always be silent — mentioned that the finest tenor he had ever known , in an amateur , belonged to his pupil , Sir Guy Morville . You can imagine my feelings at finding you so near , and learning that you had inherited your dear mother 's talent and taste . '
76855	76867	76847	76847	himself	454	' What do you mean to do about this unfortunate rencontre ? '
76868	76895	76847	76847	himself	454	' Do you mean Guy and his uncle ? He is very much pleased , poor boy ! I like his entire freedom from false shame . '
76896	76910	76847	76847	himself	454	' A little true shame would be hardly misplaced about such a connexion ! '
76911	76928	76930	76931	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' It is not his fault , and I hope it will not be his misfortune , '
76933	76940	76942	76942	Philip	454	' That it will certainly be , '
76944	76985	76942	76942	Philip	454	' if we are not on our guard ; and , indeed , if we are , there is little to be done with one so wilful . I might as well have interfered with the course of a whirlwind . '
76986	77001	76847	76847	himself	454	' No , no , Philip ; he is too candid to be wilful . '
77002	77038	76942	76942	Philip	454	' I can not be of your opinion , when I have seen him rushing into this acquaintance , in spite of the warnings he must have had here — to say nothing of myself . '
77039	77076	76847	76847	himself	454	' Nay , there I must defend him , though you will think me very unwise ; I could not feel that I ought to withhold him from taking some notice of so near a relation . '
77093	77104	77085	77085	he	454	' We must hope it may produce no evil effects . '
77105	77108	77109	77109	she	1765	' How ! '
77115	77123	77109	77109	she	1765	' Have you heard anything against him ? '
77124	77143	77085	77085	he	454	' You remember , of course , that Guy 's father was regularly the victim of this Dixon . '
77144	77164	77166	77167	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Yes , yes ; but he has had enough to sober him . Do you know nothing more ? '
77184	77228	77173	77173	she	159	' I have been inquiring about him from old Redford , and I should judge him to be a most dangerous companion ; as , indeed , I could have told from his whole air , which is completely that of a roué . '
77229	77237	77085	77085	he	454	' You have seen him , then ? '
77238	77280	77085	77085	he	454	' Yes . He paid me the compliment of taking me for Sir Guy , and of course made off in dismay when he discovered on whom he had fallen . I have seldom seen a less creditable - looking individual . '
77281	77296	77173	77173	she	159	' But what did Mr. Redford say ? Did he know of the connexion ? '
77297	77420	77085	77085	he	454	' No ; I am happy to say he did not . The fellow has decency enough not to boast of that . Well , Redford did not know much of him personally ; he said he had once been much thought of , and had considerable talent and execution : but taste changes , or he has lost something , so that though he stands tolerably high in his profession , he is not a leader . So much for his musical reputation . As to his character , he is one of those people who are called no one 's enemy but their own , exactly the introduction , Guy has hitherto happily wanted , to every sort of mischief . '
77421	77425	77427	77428	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I think , '
77435	77472	77427	77428	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' that Guy is too much afraid of small faults to be invited by larger evils . While he punishes himself for an idle word , he is not likely to go wrong in greater matters . '
77473	77478	77085	77085	he	454	' Not at present . '
77479	77502	77085	77085	he	454	' Is the man in debt or difficulties ? Guy heard nothing of that , and I thought it a good sign . '
77503	77556	77427	77428	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I do n't suppose he is . He ought not , for he has a fixed salary , besides what he gets by playing at concerts when it is not the London season . The wasting money on a spendthrift relation would be a far less evil than what I apprehend . '
77557	77577	77085	77085	he	454	' I wish I knew what to do ! It is very unlucky that your uncle is from home . '
77578	77581	77427	77428	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Very . '
77605	77606	77582	77583	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' '
77614	77620	77609	77609	you	159	' she asked , helplessly . '
77755	77756	77747	77747	I	0	' '
77767	78191	77761	77761	I	0	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , perfectly appalled . She promised , but she found the fulfilment difficult , in her dislike to vexing Guy , her fear of saying what was wrong , and a doubt , whether the appearance of persecuting Mr. Dixon , was not the very way to prevent Guy 's own good sense from finding out his true character ; so she waited , hoping Mr. Edmonstone might return before Guy went to Oxford , or that he might write decisively . Mrs. Edmonstone might have known her husband better than to expect him to write decisively when he had neither herself nor Philip at his elbow . The same post had brought him a letter from Guy , mentioning his meeting with his uncle , and frankly explaining his plans for London ; another from Philip , calling on him to use all his authority to prevent this intercourse , and a third from his wife . Bewildered between them , he took them to his sister , who , being as puzzle - headed as himself , and only hearing his involved history of the affair , confused him still more ; so he wrote to Philip , saying he was sorry the fellow had turned up , but he would guard against him . He told Guy he was sorry to say that his uncle used to be a sad scamp , and he must take care , or it would be his poor father 's story over again ; and to Mrs. Edmonstone he wrote that it was very odd that everything always did go wrong when he was away . He thought these letters a great achievement , but his wife 's perplexity was not materially relieved . After considering a good while , she at length spoke to Guy ; but it was not at a happy time , for Philip , despairing of her , had just taken on himself to remonstrate , and had angered him to the verge of an outbreak . Mrs. Edmonstone , as mildly as she could , urged on him that such intercourse could bring him little satisfaction , and might be very inconvenient ; that his uncle was in no distress , and did not require assistance ; and that it was too probable that in seeking him out he might meet with persons who might unsettle his principles , — in short , that he had much better give up the visit to London .

78656	78684	78652	78652	she	208	' If you do n't want me this afternoon , papa , I think I shall walk to Hollywell . You know Eveleen de Courcy is there . '
78685	78697	78652	78652	she	208	' No , I did not . What has brought her ? '
78698	78753	78652	78652	she	208	' As Charles expresses it , she has over - polked herself in London , and is sent here for quiet and country air . I want to call on her , and to ask Sir Guy to give me some idea as to the singing the children should practise for the school feast . '
78754	78766	78652	78652	she	208	' Then you think Sir Guy will come to the feast ? '
78767	78783	78652	78652	she	208	' I reckon on him to conceal all the deficiencies in the children 's singing . '
78784	78797	78652	78652	she	208	' He wo nt desert you , as he did Mrs. Brownlow ? '
78798	78814	78652	78652	she	208	' O papa ! you surely did not think him to blame in that affair ? '
78815	78843	78652	78652	she	208	' Honestly , Mary , if I thought about the matter at all , I thought it a pity he should go so much to the Brownlows . '
78844	78879	78652	78652	she	208	' I believe I could tell you the history , if you thought it worth while ; and though it may be gossip , I should like you to do justice to Sir Guy . '
78880	78909	78652	78652	she	208	' Very well ; though I do n't think there is much danger of my doing otherwise . I only wondered he should become intimate there at all . '
78910	78940	78652	78652	she	208	' I believe Mrs. Edmonstone thinks it right he should see as much of the world as possible , and not be always at home in their own set . '
78941	78946	78652	78652	she	208	' Fair and proper . '
78947	78985	78652	78652	she	208	' You know , she has shown him all the people she could,—had Eveleen staying there , and the Miss Nortons , and hunted him out to parties , when he had rather have been at home . '
78986	79012	78652	78652	she	208	' I thought he was fond of society . I remember your telling me how amused you were with his enjoyment of his first ball . '
79013	79113	78652	78652	she	208	' Ah ! he was two years younger then , and all was new . He seems to me too deep and sensitive not to find more pain than pleasure in commonplace society . I have sometimes seen that he can not speak either lightly or harshly of what he disapproves , and people do n't understand him . I was once sitting next him , when there was some talking going on about an elopement ; he did not laugh , looked almost distressed , and at last said , in a very low voice , to me , '

Guy , little changed in these two years,—not much taller , and more agile than robust,—was lopping vigorously with his great pruning - knife , Amabel nursing a bundle of drooping rose branches , Charlotte , her bonnet in a garland of wild sweet - brier , holding the matting , and continually getting entangled in the long thorny wreaths .

At the least critical parts of the work , she asked after the rest of the party , and was answered that papa had driven Charles out in the pony carriage , and that Laura and Eveleen were sitting on the lawn , reading and working with mamma . Eveleen was better , but not strong , or equal to much exertion in the heat . Mary went on to speak of her school feast and ask her question . '

80416	80466	80406	80407	Mr. Wellwood	330	' It is not settled . Guy wished it to be the sea - side ; but Philip has been recommending a farmhouse in Stylehurst parish , rather nearer St. Mildred 's Wells than Stylehurst , but quite out in the moor , and an immense way from both . '
80467	80477	80406	80407	Mr. Wellwood	330	' Do you think it will be the place ? '
80478	80522	80406	80407	Mr. Wellwood	330	' Yes ; Guy thinks it would suit Mr. Wellwood , because he has friends at St. Mildred 's , so he gave his vote for it . He expects to hear how it is settled to - day or to - morrow . '

81601	81632	81599	81599	Guy	150	' If ever there was music , it is there ; but it makes one think what the ear must be that can take in the whole of those harmonies . '

81643	81722	82019	82020	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' And see it . O Amy ! to show you the sunny sea , — the sense of breadth and vastness in that pale clear horizon line , and the infinite number of fields of light between you and it,—and the free feeling as you stand on some high crag , the wind blowing in your face across half the globe , and the waves dashing far below ! I am growing quite thirsty for the sea . '
81723	81740	81599	81599	Guy	150	' You know , papa said something about your taking your reading - party to Redclyffe . '
81741	81768	82019	82020	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' True ; but I do n't think Markham would like it , and it would put old Mrs. Drew into no end of a fuss . '
81769	81776	82019	82020	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Not like to have you ? '
81777	81846	82019	82020	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' O yes , I should be all very well ; but if they heard I was bringing three or four men with me , they would think them regular wild beasts . They would be in an awful fright . Besides , it is so long since I have been at home , that I do n't altogether fancy going there till I settle there for good . '
81847	81859	81599	81599	Guy	150	' Ah ! it will be sad going there at first . '
81860	81870	82019	82020	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' And it has not been my duty yet . '
81871	81882	82019	82020	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' But you will be glad when you get there ? '
81883	81940	81599	81599	Guy	150	' Sha'n't I ? I wonder if any one has been to shoot the rabbits on the Shag rock . They must have quite overrun it by this time . But I do n't like the notion of the first day . There is not only the great change , but a stranger at the vicarage . '
81941	81963	82019	82020	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Do you know anything about the new clergyman ? I believe Mrs. Ashford is a connexion of Lady Thorndale 's ? '
81964	82017	81599	81599	Guy	150	' Yes ; Thorndale calls them pattern people , and I have no doubt they will do great good in the parish . I am sure we want some enlightenment , for we are a most primitive race , and something beyond Jenny Robinson 's dame school would do us no harm . '
82669	82681	82655	82655	Amy	210	' My dear , what has kept you up so late ? '
82682	82828	82829	82829	Amy	210	' We have been sitting in Eveleen 's room , mamma , hearing about her London life ; and then we began to settle our plans for to - morrow , and I came to ask what you think of them . You know Guy has promised to go and hear the East - hill singing , and we were proposing , if you did not mind it , to take the pony - carriage and the donkey , and go in the morning to Easthill , have luncheon , and get Mary to go with us to the top of the great down , where we have never been . Guy has been wanting us , for a long time past , to go and see the view , and saying there is a track quite smooth enough to drive Charlie to the top . '
82882	82901	82955	82956	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Do you wish us to do anything else , mamma ? We do n't care about it . '
82902	82908	82910	82911	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' No , my dear , '
82913	82923	82925	82925	she	159	' I see no reason against it . But — '
82936	82947	82925	82925	she	159	' there is something I want to say to you . '
82967	82994	82963	82963	she	159	' Amy , my dear , I do n't wish to find fault , but I thought of advising you to take care . About Guy — '
83014	83080	83006	83007	her mother	5185	' You have been spending a great deal of time with him of late , very sensibly and pleasantly , I know ; I do n't blame you at all , my dear , so you need not look distressed . I only want you to be careful . You know , though we call him cousin , he is scarcely a relation at all . '
83081	83090	83094	83094	Amy	210	' O mamma , do n't go on , '
83098	83105	83094	83094	Amy	210	' indeed I am very sorry ! '
83150	83252	83123	83124	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Indeed , my dear , you have done nothing amiss . I only intended to tell you to be cautious for fear you should get into a way of going on which might not look well . Do n't make any great difference , I only meant that there should not be quite so much singing and gardening alone with him , or walking in the garden in the evening . You can manage to draw back a little , so as to keep more with me or with Laura , and I think that will be the best way . '
83376	83385	83363	83364	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Good night , my own dear child , '
83390	83397	83399	83399	Amy	210	' Good night , dear mamma , '

84907	84918	84921	84921	Amy	210	' But it is right ; it must be done , '
84936	85043	84921	84921	Amy	210	' If I was wrong before , I must bear it now , and he will see the rights of it sooner or later . The worst of all would be my not doing the very most right to please anybody . Besides , he ca n't really care for missing silly little Amy when he has mamma and Charlie . And he is going away , so it will be easier to begin right when he comes back . Be that as it may , it must be done . I 'll get Charlie to tell me what he was saying about the painted glass . '
85046	85060	85062	85062	Charles	156	' What is the matter with Amy ? What makes her so odd ? '

87672	87715	87668	87668	Amy	210	' Oh ! that would make it all comfortable . Only it was partly mine , for not keeping Charlotte in better order , and we must not throw it all on her and Eveleen . You think we may tell him ? '
87716	87735	87740	87741	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I think he ought not to be allowed to fancy you let your name be so used . '

88323	88330	88332	88332	he	150	' Do n't think of it ! '
88339	88384	88332	88332	he	150	' It was our fault , I could not stop it ; I should have kept Charlotte in better order , but they would not let her hear me . I knew it was what you dislike particularly , and I was very sorry . '
88385	88401	88402	88402	he	150	' You — I was — I was . But no matter now . Amy , '
88407	88428	88402	88402	he	150	' may I ask you to walk on with me a little way . I must say something to you . '
88432	88434	88332	88332	he	150	' mamma '
88525	88617	88637	88637	he	150	' You ought to be told why your words and looks have such effect on me as to make me behave as I did last night . Shame on me for such conduct ! I know its evil , and how preposterous it must make what I have to tell you . I do n't know how long it has been , but almost ever since I came here , a feeling has been growing up in me towards you , such as I can never have for any one else . '
88658	88746	88637	88637	he	150	' If ever there is to be happiness for me on earth , it must be through you , as you , for the last three years , have been all my brightness here . What I feel for you is beyond all power of telling you , Amy ! But I know full well all there is against me — I know I am untried , and how can I dare to ask one born to brightness and happiness to share the doom of my family ? '
88780	88790	88791	88791	he	150	' It seems selfish even to dream of it , '
88794	88852	88853	88853	he	150	' yet I must,—I can not help it . To feel that I had your love to keep me safe , to know that you watched for me , prayed for me , were my own , my Verena,—oh Amy ! it would be more joy than I have ever dared to hope for . But mind , '
88861	88951	88853	88853	he	150	' I would not even ask you to answer me now , far less to bind yourself , even if — if it were possible . I know my trial is not come ; and were I to render myself , by positive act , unworthy even to think of you , it would be too dreadful to have entangled you , and made you unhappy . No . I speak now , because I ought not to remain here with such feelings unknown to your father and mother . '
89066	89081	89019	89019	she	210	' O mamma , mamma , he says — he says he loves me ! '
89177	89183	89189	89189	he	150	' Come in , Guy , '

89573	89607	89555	89555	she	210	' If you tell me to hope ! Oh , Mrs. Edmonstone ! is it wrong that an earthly incentive to persevere should have power which sometimes seems greater than the true one ? '

89626	89655	89624	89624	she	210	' If you spoke of keeping right only for Amy 's sake , then I might fear ; but when she is second , there is confidence indeed . '

89666	89676	89677	89677	she	210	' There is one thing I ought to say , '
89680	89746	89677	89677	she	210	' you know you are very young , and though — though I do n't know that I can say so in my own person , a prudent woman would say , that you have seen so little of the world , that you may easily meet a person you would like better than such a quiet little dull thing as your guardian 's daughter . '
89769	89783	89765	89765	he	150	' I am glad you do n't say it in your own person . '
89784	89803	89805	89806	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' It is very bold and presumptuous in me to say anything at all in papa 's absence , '
89810	89855	89805	89806	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' but I am sure he will think in the same way , that things ought to remain as they are , and that it is our duty not to allow you to be , or to feel , otherwise than entirely at liberty . '
89856	89867	89869	89869	Guy	150	' I dare say it may be right in you , '
89873	89893	89869	89869	Guy	150	' However , I must not complain . It is too much that you should not reject me altogether . '
90096	90163	90085	90085	Charlotte	277	' Oh , here you are ! We could not think what had become of you . There has Deloraine been at the door these ten minutes , and Charlie sent me to find you , for he says if you are too late for Mrs. Henley 's dinner , she will write such an account of you to Philip as you will never get over . '
90257	90262	90263	90263	he	150	' Good - bye ! '

90428	90712	90414	90414	she	277	' then sprung on his horse , and looked up . Amy was at the window , he saw her head bending forward , under its veil of curls , in the midst of the roses round the lattice ; their eyes met once more , he gave one beamy smile , then rode off at full speed , with Bustle racing after him , while Amy threw herself on her knees by her bed , and with hands clasped over her face prayed that she might be thankful enough , and never be unworthy of him . Every one wanted to get rid of every one else except Mrs. Edmonstone ; for all but Charlotte guessed at the state of the case , and even she perceived that something was going on . Lady Eveleen was in a state of great curiosity ; but she had mercy , she knew that they must tell each other before it came to her turn , and very good naturedly she invited Charlotte to come into the garden with her , and kept her out of the way by a full account of her last fancy ball , given with so much spirit and humour that Charlotte could not help attending . Charles and Laura gained little by this kind manoeuvre , for their mother was gone up again to Amy , and they could only make a few conjectures . Charles nursed his right hand , and asked Laura how hers felt ? She looked up from her work , to which she had begun to apply herself diligently , and gazed at him inquiringly , as if to see whether he intended anything . '

The tap of his crutches , and the slow motion with which he raised himself from step to step , was heard ; and Amy , who was leaning against her mother , started up , exclaiming , — '

93082	93449	93051	93051	you	454	' Laura not being wo nt to make playful repartees , her silence passed unnoticed . Her feelings were mixed ; but perhaps the predominant one was satisfaction that it was not for her pink cheeks that she was valued . It had occurred to Mrs. Edmonstone that it was a curious thing , after her attempt at scheming for Eveleen , to have to announce to her that Guy was attached to her own daughter ; nay , after the willingness Eveleen had manifested to be gratified with any attention Guy showed her , it seemed doubtful for a moment whether the intelligence would be pleasing to her . However , Eveleen was just the girl to like men better than women , and never to be so happy as when on the verge of flirting ; it would probably have been the same with any other youth that came in her way ; and Guy might fully be acquitted of doing more than paying her the civilities which were requisite from him to any young lady visitor . He had , two years ago , when a mere boy , idled , laughed , and made fun with her ; but his fear of trifling away his time had made him draw back , before he had involved himself in what might have led to anything further ; and during the present visit , no one could doubt that he was pre - occupied with Amy . At any rate , it was right that Eveleen should know the truth , in confidence , if only to prevent her from talking of any surmises she might have . Mrs. Edmonstone was set at ease in a moment . Eveleen was enchanted , danced round and round the room , declared they would be the most charming couple in the world ; she had seen it all along ; she was so delighted they had come to an understanding at last , poor things , they were so miserable all last week ; and she must take credit to herself for having done it all . Was not her aunt very much obliged to her ? '
93454	93512	93051	93051	you	454	' exclaimed Mrs. Edmonstone , into whose mind the notion never entered that any one could boast of such a proceeding as hers last night ; but the truth was that Eveleen , feeling slightly culpable , was delighted that all had turned out so well , and resolved to carry it off with a high hand .

And now , if you wo nt be grateful , as any other mamma in the world would have been , and as I calculated on , when I pretended to have been a prudent , designing woman , instead of a wild , mischievous monkey , at least you 'll forgive me enough to invite me to the wedding . Oh ! what a beauty of a wedding it will be ! I 'd come from Kilcoran all the way on my bare knees to see it . And you 'll let me bridesmaid , and have a ball after it ? '
93892	93986	93987	93987	Eveleen	244	' There is no saying what I may do , if you 'll only be a good girl , and hold your tongue . I do n't want to prevent your telling anything to your mamma , of course , but pray do n't let it go any further . Do n't let Maurice hear it . I have especial reasons for wishing it should not be known . You know , it is not even an engagement , and nothing must be done which can make Guy feel in the least bound . '
94012	94720	94009	94010	Queen Elizabeth	342	' Athenæum Terrace , St. Mildred 's , August 4th . My dear Philip — Thank you for returning the books , which were brought safely by Sir Guy . I am sorry you do not agree in my estimate of them . I should have thought your strong sense would have made you perceive that reasoning upon fact , and granting nothing without tangible proof , was the best remedy for a dreamy , romantic tendency to the weakness and credulity which are in the present day termed poetry and faith . It is curious to observe how these vague theories reduce themselves to the absurd when brought into practice . There are two Miss Wellwoods here , daughters of that unfortunate man who fell in a duel with old Sir Guy Morville , who seemed to make it their business to become the general subject of animadversion , taking pauper children into their house , where they educate them in a way to unfit them for their station , and teach them to observe a sort of monastic rule , preaching the poor people in the hospital to death , visiting the poor at all sorts of strange hours . Dr. Henley actually found one of them , at twelve o'clock at night , in a miserable lodging - house , filled with the worst description of inmates . Quite young women , too , and with no mother or elder person to direct them ; but it is the fashion among the attendants at the new chapel to admire them . This subject has diverted me from what I intended to say with respect to the young baronet . Your description agrees with all I have hitherto seen , though I own I expected a Redclyffe Morville to have more of the héros de roman , or rather , of the grand tragic cast of figure , as , if I remember right , was the case with this youth 's father , a much finer and handsomer young man . Sir Guy is certainly gentlemanlike , and has that sort of agreeability which depends on high animal spirits . I should think him clever , but superficial , and with his mania for music , he can hardly fail to be merely an accomplished man . In spite of all you said of the Redclyffe temper , I was hardly prepared to find it so ready to flash forth on the most inexplicable provocations . It is like walking on a volcano . I have seen him two or three times draw himself up , bite his lip , and answer with an effort and a sharpness that shows how thin a crust covers the burning lava ; but I acknowledge that he has been very civil and attentive , and speaks most properly of what he owes to you . I only hope he will not be hurt by the possession of so large a property so early in life , and I have an idea that our good aunt at Hollywell has done a good deal to raise his opinion of himself . We shall , of course , show him every civility in our power , and give him the advantage of intellectual society at our house . His letters are directed to this place , as you know South Moor Farm is out of the cognizance of the post . They seem to keep up a brisk correspondence with him from Hollywell . Few guardian 's letters are , I should guess , honoured with such deepening colour as his while reading one from my uncle . He tells me he has been calling at Stylehurst ; it is a pity , for his sake , that Colonel Harewood is at home , for the society of those sons is by no means advisable for him . I can hardly expect to offer him what is likely to be as agreeable to him as the conversation and amusements of Edward and Tom Harewood , who are sure to be at home for the St. Mildred 's races .

95179	95402	95176	95177	Margaret Henley	347	' Captain Morville was alone when he received the latter of these letters . At first a look divided between irony and melancholy passed over his face , as he read his sister 's preface and her hearsay evidence , but , as he went farther , his upper lip curled , and a sudden gleam , as of exultation in a verified prophecy , lighted his eye , shading off quickly , however , and giving place to an iron expression of rigidity and sternness , the compressed mouth , coldly - fixed eye , and sedate brow composed into a grave severity that might have served for an impersonation of stern justice . He looked through the letter a second time , folded it up , put it in his pocket , and went about his usual affairs ; but the expression did not leave his face all day , and the next morning he took a day - ticket by the railway to Broadstone , where , as it was the day of the petty sessions , he had little doubt of meeting Mr. Edmonstone . Accordingly , he had not walked far down the High Street before he saw his uncle standing on the step of the post - office , opening a letter he had just received . '

95574	95610	95571	95571	you	454	' added Mr. Edmonstone , with a rapid glance at the end of the letter,—a movement first to retain it , and then following his first impulse , with an unintelligible murmuring . Philip read — '
95617	95846	95847	95847	Yours	2071	' My dear Mr. Edmonstone , — You will be surprised at the request I have to make you , after my resolution not to exceed my allowance . However , this is not for my own expenses , and it will not occur again . I should be much obliged to you to let me have £ 1000 , in what manner you please , only I should be glad if it were soon . I am sorry I am not at liberty to tell you what I want it for , but I trust to your kindness . Tell Charlie I will write to him in a day or two ; but , between our work , and walking to St. Mildred 's for the letters , which we can not help doing every day , the time for writing is short . Another month , however and what a holiday it will be ! Tell Amy she ought to be here to see the purple of the hills in the early morning ; it almost makes up for having no sea . The races have been making St. Mildred 's very gay ; indeed , we laugh at Wellwood for having brought us here , by way of a quiet place . I never was in the way of so much dissipation in my life . '

This did not last long ; there was something in the unmoved way , in which Philip waited till he had patience to listen , which gradually mastered him ; his angry manner subsided , and , sitting down , he continued the argument in a would - be - composed voice .

Philip produced his letter , without reading the whole of it ; for he could not bear the appearance of gossip and prying , and would not expose his sister ; so he pieced it out with his own words , and made it sound far less discreditable to her . It was quite enough for Mr. Edmonstone ; the accuracy of the details seemed to strike him dumb ; and there was a long silence , which he broke , by saying , with a deep sigh , — '

96859	96870	96872	96872	Philip	454	' I am afraid the mischief is of long standing , '
96903	96970	96846	96847	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' He could hardly have arrived at losing as much as a thousand pounds , all at once , in this month at St. Mildred 's . Depend upon it , that painful as it may be at present , there is great reason , on her account , to rejoice in the discovery . You say he has never before applied to you for money ? '
96971	96996	96846	96847	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Not a farthing beyond his allowance , except this unlucky thirty pounds , for his additional expense of the tutor and the lodging . '
96997	97093	96872	96872	Philip	454	' You remember , however , that he has always seemed short of money , never appeared able to afford himself any little extra expense . You have noticed it , I know . You remember , too , how unsatisfactory his reserve about his proceedings in London has been , and how he has persisted in delaying there , in spite of all warnings . The work , no doubt , began there , under the guidance of his uncle ; and now the St. Mildred 's races and Tom Harewood have continued it . '
97094	97106	96846	96847	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' I wish he had never set foot in the place ! '

The course must have been long since begun ; but he contrived to avoid what could lead to inquiry , till he has at length involved himself in some desperate scrape . You see , he especially desires to have the money soon , and he never even attempts to say you would approve of the object . '
97186	97198	96872	96872	Philip	454	' Yes ; he has the grace not to say that . '

97216	97247	97214	97214	Philip	454	' I could have believed him unstable and thoughtless ; but the concealment , and the attempting to gain poor Amy 's affections in the midst of such a course — '

97262	97309	97255	97256	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' there is the monstrous part . He thought I was going to give up my poor little girl to a gambler , did he ? but he shall soon see what I think of him , — riches , Redclyffe , title , and all ! '

97752	97759	97761	97761	Philip	454	' Why say anything of reports ? '
97763	97779	97726	97726	he	454	' Reports are nothing . A man is not forced to defend himself from reports . '
97780	97804	97726	97726	he	454	' Yes,—hum — ha,—the accounts I have received . No . You say there is not to be a word of Mrs. Henley ? '
97805	97817	97726	97726	he	454	' Not a word that can lead her to be suspected . '

97828	97861	97825	97826	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Do n't write as if you went on hearsay evidence . Speak of proofs — irrefragable proofs — and then you convict him at once , without power of eluding you . '
97898	98063	97726	97726	he	454	' Your letter of this morning has caused me more concern than surprise , as it unhappily only adds confirmation to the intelligence already in my possession ; that either from want of resolution to withstand the seductions of designing persons , or by the impetuosity and instability of your own character , you have been led into the ruinous and degrading practice of gambling ; and that from hence proceed the difficulties that occasion your application to me for money . I am deeply grieved at thus finding that neither the principles which have hitherto seemed to guide you , nor the pledges which you used to hold sacred , nor , I may add , the feelings you have so recently expressed towards a member of my family , have been sufficient to preserve you from yielding to a temptation which could never be presented to the mind of any one whose time was properly occupied in the business of his education .

98064	98075	98077	98078	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Is that all I am to say about her , '

98093	98178	97726	97726	he	454	' Since it is , happily , no engagement , I can not see how you can , with propriety , assume that it is one , by speaking of breaking it off . Besides , give him no ground for complaint , or he will take refuge in believing himself ill - used . Ask him if he can disprove it , and when he can not , it will be time enough to act further . But wait — wait , sir , '
98193	98206	98207	98207	Philip	454	' You have not told him yet of what you accuse him . '
98218	98450	98207	98207	Philip	454	' I have no means of judging how long you have been following this unhappy course ; I had rather believe it is of recent adoption , but I do not know how to reconcile this idea with the magnitude of your demand , unless your downward progress has been more rapid than usual in such beginnings . It would , I fear , be quite vain for me to urge upon you all the arguments and reasons that ought to have been present to your mind , and prevented you from taking the first fatal step . I can only entreat you to pause , and consider the ruin and degradation to which this hateful vice almost invariably conducts its victims , and consistenly with my duty as your guardian , everything in my power shall be done to extricate you from the embarrassments in which you have involved yourself . But , in the first place , I make it a point that you treat me with perfect confidence , and make a full , unequivocal statement of your proceedings ; above all , that you explain the circumstances occasioning your request for this large sum . Remember , I say , complete candour on your part will afford the only means of rescuing you from difficulties , or of in any degree restoring you to my good opinion . '
98598	98745	98594	98594	he	156	' I wish , from the bottom of my heart , that you could clear yourself . If a dozen men had sworn it till they were black in the face , I would not have believed it of you that you could serve us in such a manner , after the way you have been treated at home , and to dare to think of my daughter with such things on your mind . I could never have believed it , but for the proofs Philip has brought ; and I am sure he is as sorry as myself . Only tell the whole truth , and I will do my best to get you out of the scrape . Though all else must be at an end between us , I am your guardian still , and I will not be harsh with you . '

So she blamed them , not , indeed , for their charity , but for slight peculiarities which might well have been lost in the brightness of the works of mercy . She spoke as with her father 's authority , though , if she had been differently disposed , she might have remembered that his system and principles were the same as theirs , and that , had he been alive , he would probably have fully approved of their proceedings . Archdeacon Morville 's name was of great weight , and justified many persons , in their own opinion , in the opposition made to Miss Wellwood , impeding her usefulness , and subjecting her to endless petty calumnies . These made Guy very angry . He knew enough of the Archdeacon through Mrs. Edmonstone , and the opinions held by Philip , to think his daughter was ascribing to him what he had never held ; but , be that as it might , Guy could not bear to hear good , evil spoken of , and his indignation was stirred as he heard these spiteful reports uttered by people who sat at home at ease , against one whose daily life was only too exalted for their imitation . His brow contracted , his eye kindled , his lip was bitten , and now and then , when he trusted himself to reply , it was with a keen , sharp power of rebuke that made people look round , astonished to hear such forcible words from one so young . Mrs. Henley was afraid of him , without knowing it ; she thought she was sparing the Morville temper when she avoided the subject , but as she stood in awe of no one else , except her brother , she disliked him accordingly . One evening , Guy had been dining at Dr. Henley 's , and was setting out , enjoying his escape from Mrs. Henley and her friends , and rejoicing in the prospect of a five miles '

101147	102554	101112	101112	you	150	' Mr. Dixon would fain have guessed whether the present thoughts were favourable , but all his hope in his extremity was in his nephew ; it might be fatal to push him too far , and , with a certain trust in his good - nature , Sebastian allowed him to walk away without further remonstrance . Guy knew his own impetuous nature too well to venture to act on impulse in a doubtful case . He had now first to consider what he was able to do , and secondly what he would do ; and this was not as clear to his mind as in the earlier days of his acquantance with his uncle . Their intercourse had never been on a comfortable footing . It would , perhaps , have been better if Philip 's advice had been followed , and no connexion kept up . Guy had once begged for some definite rule , since there was always vexation when he was known to have been with his uncle , and yet Mr. Edmonstone would never absolutely say he ought not to see him . As long as his guardian permitted it , or rather winked at it , Guy did not think it necessary to attend to Philip 's marked disapproval . Part of it was well founded , but part was dislike to all that might be considered as vulgar , and part was absolute injustice to Sebastian Dixon ; there was everything that could offend in his line of argument , and in the very circumstance of his interfering ; and Guy had a continual struggle , in which he was not always successful , to avoid showing the affront he had taken , and to reason down his subsequent indignation . The ever recurring irritation which Philip 's conversation was apt to cause him , made him avoid it as far as he could , and retreat in haste from the subjects on which they were most apt to disagree , and so his manner had assumed an air of reserve , and almost of distrust , with his cousin , that was very unlike its usual winning openness . This had been one unfortunate effect of his intercourse with his uncle , and another was a certain vague , dissatisfied feeling which his silence , and Philip 's insinuations respecting the days he spent in London left on Mr. Edmonstone 's mind , and which gained strength from their recurrence . The days were , indeed , not many ; it was only that in coming from and going to Oxford , he slept a night at an hotel in London ( for his uncle never would take him to his lodgings , never even would tell him where they were , but always gave his address at the place of his engagement ) , was conducted by him to some concert in the evening , and had him to breakfast in the morning . He could not think there was any harm in this ; he explained all he had done to Mr. Edmonstone the first time , but nothing was gained by it : his visits to London continued to be treated as something to be excused or overlooked — as something not quite correct . He would almost have been ready to discontinue them , but that he saw that his uncle regarded him with affection , and he could not bear the thought of giving up a poor relation for the sake of the opinion of his rich friends . These meetings were the one pure pleasure to which Sebastian looked , recalling to him the happier days of his youth , and of his friendship with Guy 's father ; and when Guy perceived how he valued them , it would have seemed a piece of cruel neglect to gratify himself by giving the time to Hollywell . Early in the course of their acquaintance , the importunity of a creditor revealed that , in spite of his handsome salary , Sebastian Dixon was often in considerable distress for money . In process of time , Guy discovered that at the time his uncle had been supporting his sister and her husband in all the luxury he thought befitted their rank , he had contracted considerable debts , and he had only been able to return to England on condition of paying so much a - year to his creditors . This left him very little on which to maintain his family ; but still his pride made him bent on concealing his difficulties , and it was not without a struggle that he would at first consent to receive assistance from his nephew . Guy resolved that these debts , which he considered as in fact his father 's own , should be paid as soon as he had the command of his property ; but , in the meantime , he thought himself bound to send his uncle all the help in his power , and when once the effort of accepting it at all was over , Dixon 's expectations extended far beyond his power . His allowance was not large , and the constant requests for a few pounds to meet some pressing occasion were more than he could well meet . They kept him actually a great deal poorer than men without a tenth part of his fortune , and at the end of the term he would look back with surprise at having been able to pay his way ; but still he contrived neither to exceed his allowance , nor to get into debt . This was , indeed , only done by a rigid selfdenial of little luxuries such as most young men look on nearly as necessaries ; but he had never been brought up to think self - indulgence a consequence of riches , he did not care what was said of him . He had no expensive tastes , he did not seek after society , so that he was not ill prepared for such a course , and only thought of it as an assistance in abstaining from the time - wasting that might have tempted him if he had had plenty of money to spend . The only thing that concerned him was a growing doubt lest he might be feeding extravagance instead of doing good ; and the more he disliked himself for the suspicion , the more it would return . There was no doubt much distress ; the children were sickly ; several of them died ; the doctor 's bills , and other expenses , pressed heavily , and Guy blamed himself for having doubted . Yet again , he could not conceal from himself traces that his uncle was careless and imprudent . He had once , indeed , in a violent fit of self - reproach , confessed as much , allowed that what ought to have been spent in the maintenance of his family , had gone in gambling , but immediately after , he had been seized with a fit of terror , and implored Guy to guard the secret , since , if once it came to the knowledge of his creditors , it would be all over with him . Concealment of his present difficulties was therefore no less necessary than assistance in paying the sum he owed . Indeed , as far as Guy was able to understand his confused statement , what he wanted was at once to pay a part of his debt , before he could go on to a place where he was engaged to perform , and where he would earn enough to make up the rest . Guy had intended to have sent for Deloraine , but had since given up the idea , in order to be able to help forward some plans of Miss Wellwood 's , and resigning this project would enable him to place thirty pounds at his uncle 's disposal , leaving him just enough to pay his expenses at South Moor , and carry him back to Hollywell . It was sorely against his inclination that , instead of helping a charity , his savings should go to pay gaming debts , and his five miles '

102813	102846	102780	102781	the woman	2192	' Yes , sir ; but he is not up yet . He was very late last night . Did you want to speak to him ? I 'll tell Mrs. Dixon . '
102847	102867	102868	102869	The maid	2194	' Is Mrs. Dixon here ? Then tell her Sir Guy Morville would be glad to speak to her . '
103022	103039	103009	103009	She	2200	' Mamma says she will be here directly , if you will excuse her a moment . '

103235	103247	103249	103249	she	5175	' Oh ! much better than London . There are flowers ! '
103297	103315	103288	103288	she	5175	' the high , high hills that reached up to the sky , and the pretty stones , '
104112	104127	104129	104130	her mother	5185	' What , child , do you want to give it to Sir Guy ? '
104132	104152	104129	104130	her mother	5185	' He does not want such trumpery , my dear , though you make such a work with it . '
104153	104166	104168	104168	Guy	150	' Did you mean to give it to me , my dear ! '
104187	104190	104191	104191	He	150	' Yes . '
104464	104474	104460	104460	Guy	150	' it would take to give them a start ? '
104475	104557	104558	104558	Guy	150	' It is impossible to say . Anything , I suppose , between one thousand and twenty . But , by - the - bye , this design of Elizabeth 's is an absolute secret . If you had not almost guessed it , I should never have said one word to you about it . You are a particularly dangerous man , with your connexion with Mrs. Henley . You must take special good care nothing of it reaches her . '
104832	104842	104824	104824	Guy	150	' Ha ! What on earth does this mean ? '
104898	104906	104921	104921	his	150	' Morville ! What 's the matter ? '
104907	104917	104919	104919	Guy	150	' Intolerable!—insulting ! Me ? What does he mean ? '
104928	104949	104951	104951	he	150	' Proofs ? I should like to see them ! The man is crazy ! I to confess ! Ha ! '
104957	104987	104989	104989	he	150	' I see it,—I see it . It is Philip , is it , that I have to thank . Meddling coxcomb ! I 'll make him repent it , '
104998	105004	104989	104989	he	150	' Slandering me to them ! '
105008	105031	104989	104989	he	150	' — looking at the words with regard to Amy,—'that passes all . He shall see what it is to insult me ! '
105032	105043	105045	105046	his companion	2264	' What is it ? Your guardian out of humour ? '
105048	105100	105101	105101	Guy	150	' My guardian is a mere weak fool . I do n't blame him,—he ca n't help it ; but to see him made a tool of ! He twists him round his finger , abuses his weakness to insult — to accuse . But he shall give me an account ! '
105242	105253	105254	105254	he	150	' I have had an insulting — an unpleasant letter , '
105261	105267	105254	105254	he	150	' You must excuse me , '

105340	105401	105337	105338	young Graham	361	' Some absurd person interfering between him and his guardian . I should be sorry to be him to fall in his way just now . It must be something properly bad . I never saw a man in such a rage . I think I had better go after him , and see what he has done with himself . '
105402	105408	105410	105411	Mrs. Henley	232	' You do n't think , '
105416	105430	105410	105411	Mrs. Henley	232	' than his guardian could have been finding fault with him with reason ? '
105431	105463	105337	105338	young Graham	361	' Who ? Morville ? His guardian must have a sharp eye for picking holes if he can find any in Morville . Not a steadier fellow going,—only too much so . '

Has not he hated me from the first , misconstrued every word and deed , though I have tried , striven earnestly , to be his friend,—borne , as not another soul would have done , with his impertinent interference and intolerable patronizing airs ? But he has seen the last of it ! Anything but this might be forgiven ; but sowing dissension between me and the Edmonstones , — maligning me there . Never ! Knowing , too , as he seems to do , how I stand , it is the very ecstasy of malice ! Ay ! this very night it shall be exposed , and he shall be taught to beware — made to know with whom he has to deal . '

107267	107280	107282	107282	Charles	156	' Did you ask whether there were any letters at the post ? '
107284	107305	107282	107282	Charles	156	'Guy is using us shamefully — practising selfdenial on us , I suppose . Is there no letter from him ? '

107316	107323	107312	107312	Philip	454	' Well , where is it ? '
107324	107331	107282	107282	Charles	156	' It is to your father . '

107344	107370	107337	107337	Charles	156	' Are you sure ? Depend on it , you overlooked my M. He has owed me a letter this fortnight . Let me see . '
107371	107378	107380	107380	Philip	454	' It is for my uncle , '
107392	107420	107380	107380	Philip	454	' Then he has been so stupid as to forget my second name . Come , give it me . I shall have it sooner or later . '
107421	107434	107337	107337	Charles	156	' I assure you , Charles , it is not for you . '
107435	107447	107449	107449	Charles	156	' Would not any one suppose he had been reading it ? '
107451	107466	107449	107449	Charles	156	' Did you know Mary Ross was gone to stay with her brother John ? '
107479	107485	107487	107487	Philip	454	' No ; is she ? '
107489	107497	107487	107487	Philip	454	' Yes ; his wife is ill . '
107583	107592	107568	107569	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' You have heard from St. Mildred 's ? '
107593	107596	107598	107598	Philip	454	' Yes , '
107617	107625	107602	107602	he	454	' From Guy , or from Margaret ? '
107626	107630	107568	107569	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' From Margaret . '
107631	107642	107602	107602	he	454	' But you say there is a letter from him . '
107643	107650	107602	107602	he	454	' Yes , for my uncle . '
107651	107659	107664	107664	her	5306	' Does she say nothing more satisfactory ? '
107671	107678	107664	107664	her	5306	' Has she learnt no more ? '
107679	107695	107602	107602	he	454	' Nothing more of his proceedings . I see Amy knows nothing of the matter ? '
107696	107718	107664	107664	her	5306	' No ; her papa thought there was no need to distress her till we had seen whether he could explain . '
107719	107724	107726	107726	Philip	454	' Poor little thing ! '
107728	107736	107726	107726	Philip	454	' I am very sorry for her . '
107765	107832	107752	107752	she	159	' She writes to tell the spirit in which he received my uncle 's letter . It is only the Morville temper , again ; and of course , whatever you may think of that on Amy 's account , I should never regard it , as concerns myself , as other than his misfortune . I hope he may be able to explain the rest . '
107833	107841	107843	107844	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Ah ! there comes your uncle ! '
107847	107860	107843	107844	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' How d'ye do , Philip ? Brought better news , eh ? '
107861	107871	107752	107752	she	159	' Here is a letter to speak for itself . '
107872	107903	107904	107905	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Eh ? From Guy ? Give it me . What does he say ? Let me see . Here , mamma , read it , your eyes are best . '
107911	108133	107904	107905	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' My Dear Mr. Edmonstone , — You letter surprised and grieved me very much . I can not guess what proofs Philip may think he has , of what I never did , and , therefore , I can not refute them otherwise than by declaring that I never gamed in my life . Tell me what they are , and I will answer them . As to a full confession , I could of course tell you of much in which I have done wrongly , though not in the way which he supposes . On that head , I have nothing to confess . I am sorry I am prevented from satisfying you about the £ 1000 , but I am bound in honour not to mention the purpose for which I wanted it . I am sure you could never believe I could have said what I did to Mrs. Edmonstone if I had begun on a course which I detest from the bottom of my heart . Thank you very much for the kindness of the latter part of your letter . I do not know how I could have borne it , if it had ended as it began . I hope you will soon send me these proofs of Philip 's . Ever your affectionate '
108136	108202	107904	107905	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Not a little surprised was Philip to find that he was known to be Guy 's accuser , but the conclusion revealed that his style had betrayed him , and that Mr. Edmonstone had finished with some mention of him , and he resolved that henceforth he would never leave a letter of his own dictation till he had seen it signed and sealed . '
108205	108219	108257	108257	Philip	454	' cried Mr. Edmonstone , joyfully beating his own hand with his glove , '
108259	108277	108278	108278	I	0	' the last eh being uttered much more doubtfully , and less triumphantly , than the first . '
108285	108289	108280	108280	you	0	' said Philip . '
108296	108303	108293	108293	you	0	' said Mr. Edmonstone , hastily . '
108306	108307	108293	108293	you	0	' '
108325	108326	108314	108314	he	2302	' '

108414	108422	108378	108378	he	2302	' said Mr. Edmonstone , turning away , '
108452	108453	108473	108473	he	2302	' '
108466	108470	108473	108473	he	2302	' said Philip . '
108484	108500	108473	108473	he	2302	' He held up his hand authoritatively , as his aunt was about to interpose . '
108527	108528	108519	108519	he	2302	' '
108538	108545	108529	108529	He	2302	' exclaimed Mrs. Edmonstone , indignantly . '
108575	108579	108563	108564	my uncle	5152	' said Philip ; '
108599	108600	108601	108601	I	0	' '
108613	108617	108618	108618	I	0	' said she . '
108670	108688	108663	108663	his	2302	' While I can stand fair with you , I do not wish to break with you . ''
108689	108699	108701	108702	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' He will not find that quite so easy ! '
108704	108754	108701	108702	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' I am no fool to be hoodwinked , especially where my little Amy is concerned . I 'll see all plain and straight before he says another word of her . But you see what comes of their settling it , while I was out of the way . '
108843	108848	108850	108851	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Well , well , '
108853	108897	108850	108851	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' the question is what to do next — eh , Philip ? I wish he would have spoken openly . I hate mysteries . I 'll write and tell him this wo nt do ; he must be explicit — eh Philip ? '
108898	108910	108912	108912	Philip	454	' We will talk it over by - and - bye , '
108971	108986	108988	108988	she	5306	' Do n't ring , mamma , dear . I 'll fasten your dress , '
109019	109020	109007	109007	you	5168	' '
109034	109054	109021	109021	I	0	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , kissing her , as she saw how her colour first deepened and then faded . '
109059	109063	109021	109021	I	0	' said she . '
109080	109081	109077	109078	your papa	2316	' '
109091	109092	109085	109085	Philip	454	' '

109128	109139	109121	109121	you	5168	' said Amy , in a low , trembling voice . '
109154	109159	109146	109146	himself	2315	' Amy did not say '
109165	109173	109146	109146	himself	2315	' but she held up her head . '
109179	109183	109175	109175	papa	5164	' she said . '
109196	109201	109175	109175	papa	5164	' said her mother ; '
109240	109272	109273	109273	I	0	' she added , smoothing fondly the long , soft hair , sad at heart to see the cares and griefs of womanhood gathering over her child 's bright young life . '
109282	109290	109295	109295	her	210	' murmured Amy to herself . Only , '
109308	109337	109299	109299	she	210	' I ca n't bear them to vex him . I wish Philip would let papa settle it alone . Guy will be angry , and grieved afterwards . '
109358	109367	109369	109369	she	210	' I said I would learn to bear , '
109373	109446	109369	109369	she	210	' or I shall never be fit for him . Yes , I will , even though it is the thinking he is unhappy . He said I must be his Verena ; I know what that means ; I ought not to be uneasy , for he will bear it beautifully , and say he is glad of it afterwards . And I will try not to seem cross to Philip . '
110118	110132	110134	110135	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' You would not be so mad as to fight him , eh ? '
110139	110152	110134	110135	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' You know better — besides , for poor Amy 's sake . '
110153	110160	110162	110162	Philip	454	' For the sake of right , '
110164	110197	110162	110162	Philip	454	' no . I have reassured my sister . I have told her that , let the boy do what he will , he shall never make me guilty of his death . '
110198	110207	110134	110135	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' You have heard from him , then ? '
110208	110269	110271	110271	Philip	454	' No ; I suppose a night 's reflection convinced him that he had no rational grounds for violent proceedings , and he had sense enough not to expose himself to such an answer as I should have given . What caused his wrath to be directed towards me especially , I can not tell , nor can my sister , '
110279	110294	110271	110271	Philip	454	' but I seem to have come in for a full share of it . '
110480	110488	110467	110467	he	156	' I would never have thought it ! '
110611	110723	110724	110724	Your	2349	' Dear Sir Guy , — Since you refuse the confidence which I have a right to demand , since you elude the explanation I asked , and indulge yourself in speaking in disrespectful terms of me and my family , I have every reason to suppose that you have no desire to continue on the same footing as heretofore at Hollywell . As your guardian , I repeat that I consider myself bound to keep a vigilant watch over your conduct , and if possible to recover you from the unhappy course in which you have involved yourself , but all other intercourse between you and this family must cease . '
110735	110739	110740	110741	C. Edmonstone	350	' Yours faithfully , '
110743	110899	110740	110741	C. Edmonstone	350	' This letter was more harsh than Philip wished ; but Mr. Edmonstone would hardly be prevailed on to consent to enter on no further reproaches . He insisted on banishing Deloraine , as well as on the mention of Guy 's disrespect , both against his nephew 's opinion ; but it was necessary to let him have his own way on these points , and Philip thought himself fortunate in getting a letter written , which was in any degree rational and moderate . They had been so busy , and Mr. Edmonstone so excited , that Philip thought it best to accept the offer of tea being sent them in the dining - room , and it was not till nearly midnight that their conference broke up , when Mr. Edmonstone found his wife sitting up by the dressing - room fire , having shut Charles 's door sorely against his will . '
110902	110907	110740	110741	C. Edmonstone	350	' began Mr. Edmonstone , '
110938	111139	111145	111145	Guy	150	' So he proceeded with the narration , mixing the facts undistinguishably with his own surmises , and overwhelming his wife with dismay . If a quarter of this was true , defence of Guy was out of the question ; and it was still more impossible to wish Amy 's attachment to him to continue , and , though much was incredible , it was no time to say so . She could only hope morning would soften her husband 's anger , and make matters explicable . Morning failed to bring her comfort . Mr. Edmonstone repeated that Amy must be ordered to give up all thoughts of Guy , and she perceived that the words ascribed to him stood on evidence which could not be doubted . She could believe he might have spoken them in the first shock of an unjust imputation , and she thought he might have been drawn into some scrape to serve a friend ; but she could never suppose him capable of all Mr. Edmonstone imagined . The first attempt to plead his cause , however , brought on her an angry reply ; for Philip , by a hint that she '
111147	111250	111145	111145	Guy	150	' had put it into his uncle 's head that she would try to lead him , and made him particularly inaccessible to her influence . There was no help for it , then ; poor little Amy must hear the worst ; and it was not long before Mrs. Edmonstone found her waiting in the dressing - room . Between obedience to her husband , her conviction of Guy 's innocence , and her tenderness to her daughter , Mrs. Edmonstone had a hard task , and she could scarcely check her tears as Amy nestled up for her morning kiss . '
111258	111259	111145	111145	Guy	150	' '

111343	111356	111335	111335	He	2316	' repeated Amy , as if she had not heard the rest . '
111363	111406	111335	111335	He	2316	' As she spoke , Charles 's door was pushed open , and in he came , half dressed , scrambling on , with but one crutch , to the chair near which she stood , with drooping head and clasped hands . '
111413	111417	111410	111411	little Amy	210	' he said , '
111423	111463	111491	111492	his mother	612	' tis only some monstrous figment of Mrs. Henley 's . Trust my word , it will right itself ; it is only a rock to keep true love from running too smooth . Come , do n't cry , '
111472	111481	111491	111492	his mother	612	' I only meant to cheer you up . '
111482	111489	111498	111498	her	612	' I am afraid , Charlie , '
111502	111525	111498	111498	her	612	' it is not the best or kindest way to do her good by telling her to dwell on hopes of him . '
111526	111534	111536	111536	Charles	156	' Mamma one of Philip 's faction ! '
111538	111557	111536	111536	Charles	156	' Of no faction at all , Charles , but I am afraid it is a bad case ; '
111727	111734	111735	111735	she	210	' My poor dear little Amy ! '
111738	111753	111735	111735	she	210	' O Philip , now I see all you thought to save me from ! '
111754	111766	111693	111693	he	156	' It is an unhappy business that it ever was permitted ! '
111767	111827	111828	111828	He	2366	' Poor little dear ! She was so happy , so very happy and sweet in her humility , and her love . Do you know , Philip , I was almost jealous for a moment that all should be so easy for them ; and I blamed poverty , but oh ! there are worse things than poverty ! '
111926	111942	111950	111951	His father	616	' Now then , Philip , let me know the true grounds of your persecution . '
111975	111981	111983	111983	Charles	156	' So the fact is , '
111988	112031	111983	111983	Charles	156	' that Guy has asked for his own money , and when in lieu of it he received a letter full of unjust charges , he declared that Philip was a meddling coxcomb . I advise you not to justify his opinion . '
112051	112059	112048	112048	Charles	156	' This is the great sum total . '
112060	112063	112065	112065	Philip	454	' No , '
112067	112075	112065	112065	Philip	454	' I have proof of his gambling . '
112076	112081	112048	112048	Charles	156	' What is it ? '
112082	112096	112048	112048	Charles	156	' I have shown it to your father , and he is satisfied . '
112097	112131	112133	112134	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Is it not proof enough that he is lost to all sense of propriety that he should go and speak in that fashion of us , and to Philip 's own sister ? '
112136	112143	112133	112134	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' What would you have more ? '
112144	112170	112172	112172	Charles	156	' That little epithet applied to Captain Morville is hardly , to my mind , proof sufficient that a man is capable of every vice , '

112471	112478	112480	112480	Charles	156	' Thank you for the permission , '
112484	112496	112498	112498	Philip	454	' It is not to me that your submission is due , '
112500	112528	112498	112498	Philip	454	' I 'll tell you what , Philip , I submit to my own father readily , but I do not submit to Captain Morville 's instrument . '
112529	112541	112543	112543	Philip	454	' We have had enough of unbecoming retorts for one day , '
112588	112599	112600	112600	he	156	' People who always come when they are not wanted ! '
112616	112632	112634	112634	Philip	454	' I do not think you in a fit mood to be advised , Charles , '
112636	112658	112634	112634	Philip	454	' but to free my own conscience , let me say this . Take care how you promote this unfortunate attachment . '
112659	112666	112668	112668	Charles	156	' Take care what you say ! '
112852	112860	112862	112862	Charles	156	' A fine helpless log am I , '
112872	112922	112862	112862	Charles	156	' A pretty thing for me to talk of being of any use , when I ca n't so much as show my anger at an impertinence about my own sister , without being beholden for not breaking my neck to the very piece of presumption that uttered it . '
112923	112931	112933	112933	Amy	210	' Oh , do n't speak so , '
112960	112968	112970	112970	Charles	156	' I do n't care who hears , '
112972	113076	112970	112970	Charles	156	' I say there is no greater misery in this world than to have the spirit of a man and the limbs of a cripple . I know if I was good for anything , things would not long be in this state . I should be at St. Mildred 's by this time , at the bottom of the whole story , and Philip would be taught to eat his words in no time , and make as few wry faces as suited his dignity . But what is the use of talking ? This sofa'—and he struck his fist against it — '

113118	113139	113110	113110	Amy	210	' do n't talk so . Indeed , I ca n't bear it ! You know it is not so . '
113140	113205	113082	113082	I	0	' Do I ? Have not I been talking myself hoarse , showing up their injustice , saying all a man could say to bring them to reason , and not an inch could I move them . I do believe Philip has driven my father stark mad with these abominable stories of his sister 's , which I verily believe she invented herself . '
113206	113219	113110	113110	Amy	210	' O no , she could not . Do n't say so . '
113220	113232	113082	113082	I	0	' What ? Are you going to believe them , too . '

113285	113300	113280	113280	Philip	454	' said Amy , who could not at the moment say anything more charitable . '

113341	113345	113337	113337	they	2394	' whispered Amy . '
113377	113425	113355	113355	I	0	' Amy gave the materials to her brother , and then turning away , busied herself in silence as best she might , in the employment her mother had recommended her , of sorting some garden seeds for the cottagers . After an interval , Charles said , '
113439	113451	113432	113432	I	0	' There was a little silence , and presently Amy whispered , '

113463	113486	113452	113452	I	0	' asked Charles , not catching her very low tones , as she sat behind him , with her head bent down . '

113528	113538	113520	113520	Papa	168	' and there her voice was stopped with tears . '
113545	113549	113520	113520	Papa	168	' said Charles ; '

113594	113598	113599	113599	He	5156	' faltered Amy . '

113631	113640	113625	113625	I	0	' said Amy , in a broken voice . '
113646	113647	113625	113625	I	0	' '
113652	113656	113657	113657	You	210	' said Charles . '
113753	113754	113746	113746	I	0	' '
113763	113774	113758	113758	you	156	' said Amy , with an irrepressible burst of weeping . '
113795	113810	113787	113787	you	156	' She wept in silence for some moments ; at last she said , — '
113887	114008	113873	113873	I	0	' Poor little Amy , she seldom knew worse pain than at that moment , when she was obliged to go away to put it out of her power to follow the promptings of her heart to send the few kind words which might prove that nothing could shake her love and trust . A fresh trial awaited her when she looked from her own window . She saw Deloraine led out , his chestnut neck glossy in the sun , and William prepared for a journey , and the other servants shaking hands , and bidding him good - bye . She saw him ride off , and could hardly help flying back to her brother , to exclaim , '
114018	114055	114012	114012	they	2402	' while the longing to send one kind greeting became more earnest than ever ; but she withstood it , and throwing herself on the bed , exclaimed,—'He will never come back — never , never ! '
114101	114113	114097	114097	Laura	454	' My own Amy , my poor dearest,—I am very sorry ! '
114114	114121	114123	114123	Amy	210	' Thank you , dear Laura , '
114133	114144	114146	114146	Laura	454	' I wish I knew what to do for you ! '
114148	114163	114146	114146	Laura	454	' You can not cease to think about him , and yet you ought . '
114164	114174	114176	114176	Amy	210	' If I ought , I suppose I can , '
114185	114207	114176	114176	Amy	210	' That 's right , darling . You will not be weak , and pine for one who is not worthy . '
114208	114214	114216	114216	Amy	210	' Not worthy , Laura ? '
114228	114238	114216	114216	Amy	210	' Ah ! my poor Amy , we thought — '
114239	114262	114176	114176	Amy	210	' Yes ; and it is so still . I know it is so . I know he did not do it . '
114263	114274	114176	114176	Amy	210	' Then what do you think of Margaret and Philip ? '
114275	114281	114216	114216	Amy	210	' There is some mistake . '
114282	114294	114176	114176	Amy	210	' And how can you defend what he said of papa ? '
114295	114300	114302	114302	Amy	210	' I do n't , '
114308	114376	114302	114302	Amy	210	' that is the worst ; but I am sure it was only a moment 's passion , and that he must be very unhappy about it now . I do n't think papa would mind it , at least , not long , if it was not for this other dreadful misapprehension . O Laura ! why can not something be done to clear it up ? '
114377	114383	114385	114385	Laura	454	' Everything will be done , '
114387	114411	114385	114385	Laura	454	' Papa has written to Mr. Wellwood ; and Philip means to go and make inquiries at Oxford and at St. Mildred 's . '
114414	114418	114302	114302	Amy	210	' asked Amy . '
114442	114443	114424	114424	You	454	' '
114471	114472	114473	114473	He	2404	' '
114504	114505	114506	114506	I	0	' '
114522	114528	114511	114511	he	2404	' said Amy , blushing . '
114537	114538	114533	114533	he	2404	' '
114576	114587	114566	114566	You	210	' Amy made no answer , and Laura was annoyed . '
114631	114657	114658	114658	He	2404	' It was said in Philip 's manner , which , perhaps , made it harder to bear ; and Amy could scarcely answer , — '
114665	114666	114658	114658	He	2404	' '
114676	114677	114667	114667	You	2404	' '
114683	114689	114667	114667	You	2404	' said Amy , sadly . '
114707	114923	114699	114699	he	2404	' Laura endeavoured to persuade her that nothing could have been more kind and judicious , and Amy sat dejectedly owning the good intention , and soothed by the affection of her family ; but with the bitter suffering of her heart unallayed , with all her fond , tender feelings torn at the thought of what Guy must be enduring , and with the pain of knowing it was her father 's work . She had one comfort , in the certainty that Guy would bear it nobly . She was happy to find her confidence confirmed by her mother and Charles ; and one thing she thought she need not give up , though she might no longer think of him as her lover , she might be his Verena still , whether he knew it or not . It could not be wrong to remember any one in her prayers , and to ask that he might not be led into temptation , but have strength to abide patiently . That helped her to feel that he was in the hands of One to whom the secrets of all hearts are known ; and a line of poetry seemed to be whispered in her ears , in his own sweet tones , — '
114933	115144	115145	115145	he	2410	' So , after the first day , she went on pretty well . She was , indeed , silent and grave , and no longer the sunbeam of Hollywell ; but she took her share in what was passing , and a common observer would hardly have remarked the submissive melancholy of her manner . Her father was very affectionate , and often called her his jewel of good girls ; but he was too much afraid of women 's tears to talk to her about Guy , he left that to her mother ; and Mrs. Edmonstone , having seen her submit to her father 's will , was unwilling to say more . She doubted whether it was judicious to encourage her in dwelling on Guy ; for , even supposing his character cleared , they had offended him deeply , and released him from any engagement to her , so that there was nothing to prevent him from forming an attachment elsewhere . Mrs. Edmonstone did not think he would ; but it was better to say nothing about him , lest she should not speak prudently , and only keep up the subject in Amy 's mind . Charles stormed and wrangled , told Mr. Edmonstone '
115157	115369	115145	115145	he	2410	' and talked of unfairness and injustice , till Mr. Edmonstone vowed it was beyond all bearing , that his own son should call him a tyrant , and accused Guy of destroying all peace in his family . The replies to the letters came ; some thought them satisfactory , and the others wondered that they thought so . Mr. Wellwood gave the highest character of his pupil , and could not imagine how any irregularities could be laid to his charge ; but when asked in plain terms how he disposed of his time , could only answer in general , that he had friends and engagements of his own at St. Mildred 's and its neighbourhood , and had been several times at Mrs. Henley 's and at Colonel Harewood 's . The latter place , unfortunately , was the very object of Philip 's suspicions ; and thus the letter was anything but an exculpation . Guy wrote to Charles in the fulness of his heart , expressing gratitude for his confidence and sympathy . He again begged for the supposed evidence of his misconduct , declaring he could explain it , whatever it might be , and proceeded to utter deep regrets for his hasty expressions . '
115380	115384	115375	115375	I	0	' he wrote ; '
115453	115701	115443	115443	He	156	' Charles pronounced this to be only Guy 's way of abusing himself ; but his father saw in it a disguised admission of guilt . It was thought , also , to be a bad sign that Guy intended to remain at Southmoor till the end of the vacation , though Charles argued that he must be somewhere ; and if they wished to keep him out of mischief , why exile him from Hollywell ? He would hardly listen to his mother 's representation , that on Amy 's account , it would not be right to have him there till the mystery was cleared up . He tried to stir his father up to go and see Guy at St. Mildred 's , and investigate matters for himself ; but , though Mr. Edmonstone would have liked the appearance of being important , this failed , because Philip declared it to be unadvisable , knowing that it would be no investigation at all , and that his uncle would be talked over directly . Next , Charles would have persuaded Philip himself to go , but the arrangements about his leave did not make this convenient ; and it was put off till he should pay his farewell visit to his sister , in October . Lastly , Charles wrote to Mrs. Henley , entreating her to give him some information about this mysterious evidence which was wanting ; but her reply was a complete '
115704	115859	115443	115443	He	156	' for interference in a matter with which he had no concern . He was very angry . In fact , the post seldom came in without occasioning a fresh dispute , which only had the effect of keeping up the heat of Mr. Edmonstone 's displeasure , and making the whole house uncomfortable . Fretfulness and ill - humour seemed to have taken possession of Charles and his father . Such a state of things had not prevailed since Guy 's arrival ; Hollywell was hardly like the same house ; Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura could do nothing without being grumbled at or scolded by one or other of the gentlemen ; even Amy now and then came in for a little petulance on her father 's part , and Charles could not always forgive her for saying , in her mournful , submissive tone,—'It is of no use to talk about it . '
117155	117183	117143	117143	he	454	' Well , little one , how are you ? I have your piece of spar quite safe . Have you said how d'ye do to Bustle ? '
117184	117189	117201	117202	his master	755	' Bustle ! Bustle ! '
117214	117224	117143	117143	he	454	' Have you been taking any more pleasant walks ? '
117225	117275	117143	117143	he	454	' Oh yes . We have been all round these pretty paths . And I should like to get to the top of this great high hill , and see all round ; but mamma says she has got a bone in her leg , and can not go . '
117276	117296	117297	117297	She	5175	' Do you think mamma would give you leave to go up with me ? Should you like it ? '
117309	117312	117314	117314	Guy	150	' Then , '
117320	117352	117314	117314	Guy	150	' I will meet you here when you have done your business in the town , in an hour or so . Poor little thing , she has not many pleasures . '
117603	117616	117595	117595	she	5175	' contemplation — a long time for such a child — was , '
117627	117632	117595	117595	she	5175	' then presently after , '
117643	117644	117639	117639	Felix	370	' '
117657	117674	117639	117639	Felix	370	' said Guy , kindly ; and she looked up in his face , and exclaimed , '
117683	117684	117678	117678	you	454	' '
117690	117694	117685	117685	You	454	' said Guy . '
117708	117709	117710	117710	Mamma	155	' '
117724	117728	117721	117721	her	155	' said Marianne ; '
117735	117978	117710	117710	Mamma	155	' Her little heart was soon open . It appeared that Felix was the last who had died , the nearest in age to Marianne , and her favourite playfellow . She told of some of their sports in their London home , speaking of them with eagerness and fondness that showed what joys they had been , though to Guy they seemed but the very proof of dreariness and dinginess . She talked of walks to school when Felix would tell what he would do when he was a man , and how he took care of her at the crossings , and how rude boys used to drive them , and how they would look in at the shop windows and settle what they would buy if they were rich . Then she talked of his being ill — ill so very long , how he sat in his little chair , and could not play , and then always lay in bed , and she liked to sit by him there ; but at last he died , and they carried him away in a great black coffin , and he would never come back again . But it was so dull now , there was no one to play with her . Though the little girl did not cry , she looked very mournful , and Guy tried to comfort her , but she did not understand him . '
117982	118216	118217	118217	Wellwood	330	' only conveyed to her a notion of death and separation ; and this phrase , together with a vague idea who had made her , and that she ought to be good , seemed to be the extent of the poor child 's religious knowledge . She hardly ever had been at church ; and though she had read one or two Bible stories , it seemed to have been from their having been used as lessons at school . She had a dim notion that good people read the Bible , and there was one on the little table at home , with the shell - turkey - cock standing upon it , and mamma read it when Felix died ; but it was a big book , and the shell - turkey - cock always stood upon it ; in short , it seemed only connected with mamma 's tears and the loss of her brother . Guy was very much shocked , and so deep in thought that he could hardly talk to the child in their progress down the hill ; but she was just so tired as to be inclined to silence , and quite happy clinging to his hand , till he delivered her over to her mother at the foot of the hill , and went to join his tutor , at the place appointed .

118219	118238	118217	118217	Wellwood	330	' said he , breaking silence , when they had walked about half way back to the farm , '
118261	118282	118259	118260	the parents	2469	' consent , it would be the greatest charity on earth if Miss Wellwood would receive her into her school . '
118283	118298	118259	118260	the parents	2469	' On what terms ? What sort of an education is she to have ? '
118339	118880	118881	118881	You	2473	' and he went on to explain as much as was needful . It ended in a resolution that if Miss Wellwood would undertake the charge , the proposal should be made to Mrs. Dixon . It was a way of assisting his relations likely to do real good , and on the other hand , he would be able , under colour of the payment for the child , to further Miss Wellwood 's schemes , and give her the interest of the thousand pounds , until his five and twentieth year might put his property in his own power . Miss Wellwood readily consented , much pleased with the simplicity and absence of false shame he showed in the whole transaction , and very anxious for the good of a child in a class so difficult to reach . He next went to Mrs. Dixon , expecting more difficulty with her , but he found none . She thought it better Marianne should live at St. Mildred 's than die in London , and was ready to catch at the prospect of her being fitted for a governess . Indeed , she was so strongly persuaded that the rich cousin might make Marianne 's fortune , that she would have been very unwilling to interfere with the fancy he had taken for her . Little Marianne was divided between fear of leaving mamma and liking for St. Mildred 's but her first interview with Miss Wellwood , and Miss Jane 's showing her a little white bed , quite turned the scale in their favour . Before the time came for Guy 's return to Oxford , he had seen her settled , heard her own account of her happy life , and had listened to Miss Jane Wellwood 's delight in her sweet temper and good disposition . Those thousand pounds ; Guy considered again and again whether he could explain their destination , and whether this would clear him . It seemed to him only a minor charge , and besides his repugnance to mention such a design , he saw too many obstacles in his way . Captain Morville and his sister were the very persons from whom Miss Wellwood 's project was to be kept secret . Besides , what would be gained ? It was evident that Guy 's own assertions were doubted , and he could bring no confirmation of them ; he had never spoken of his intention to his tutor , and Mr. Wellwood could , therefore , say nothing in his favour . If Mr. Edmonstone alone had been concerned , or if this had been the only accusation , Guy might have tried to explain it ; but with Philip he knew it would be useless , and therefore would not enter on the subject . He could only wait patiently . Tennyson . Guy had been about a week at Oxford , when one evening , as he was sitting alone in his rooms , he received an unexpected visit from Captain Morviller . He was glad , for he thought a personal interview would remove all misconstructions , and held out his hand cordially , saying : '
118891	118892	118888	118888	you	2473	' '
118922	119267	118911	118911	I	0	' While speaking , Philip was surveying the apartment , for he held that a man 's room is generally an indication of his disposition , and assuredly there was a great deal of character in his own , with the scrupulous neatness and fastidious taste of its arrangements . Here , he thought , he could not fail to see traces of his cousin 's habits , but he was obliged to confess to himself that there was very little to guide him . The furniture was strictly as its former occupant had left it , only rather the worse for wear , and far from being in order . The chairs were so heaped with books and papers , that Guy hat to make a clearance of one before his visitor could sit down ; but there was nothing else to complain of , not even a trace of cigars ; but knowing him to be a great reader and lover of accomplishments , Philip wondered that the only decorations were Lauras drawing of Sintram , and a little print of Redclyffe , and the books were chiefly such as were wanted for his studies ; the few others having for the most part the air of old library books , as if he had sent for them form Redclyffe . Was this another proof that he had some way of frittering away his money with nothing to show for it ? A Sophocles and a lexicon were open before him on the table , and a blotting book , which he closed , but not before Philip had caught sight of what looked like verses . Neither did his countenance answer Philip 's expectations . It had not his usual bright lively expression ; there was a sadness which made his smile like a gleam on a showery day , instead of constant sunshine ; but there was neither embarrassment nor defiance , and the gleamlike smile was there , as , with a frank , confiding tone , he said : '
119286	119318	119280	119280	you	2475	' Philip was by no means prepared to be thus met halfway , but he thought Guy wanted to secure him as an intercessor , and hardened himself into righteous severity . '
119343	119380	119341	119341	yourself	2475	' Instantly , the sedate measured tone made Guy 's heart and head throb with impatience , awakening all the former memories so hardly battled down ; but with the impulse of anger came the thought , '
119406	119420	119399	119400	The enemy	2477	' He forced himself not to interrupt , while Philip went calmly on . '

119446	119468	119433	119433	My	0	' said Guy , speaking fast and low , and repressing the feeling , which , nevertheless , affected his voice ; '

119534	119535	119536	119536	I	0	' '
119542	119558	119539	119539	I	0	' said Guy , colouring deeply , and all irritation disappearing from voice and manner ; '

119596	119600	119579	119579	I	0	' returned Philip , '
119635	119643	119645	119645	you	2475	' Guy was nearly choked in uttering a '
119647	119662	119645	119645	you	2475	' which did not sound , after all , much like acceptance of forgiveness . '
119671	119675	119715	119715	he	5152	' said Philip ; '
119688	119689	119685	119686	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' '
119700	119704	119690	119690	I	0	' siad Guy ; '

119757	119758	119744	119744	He	5152	' '
119773	119777	119761	119761	you	2475	' exclaimed Guy . '
119790	119815	119817	119817	you	2475	' said Philip ; and as at those words the flash of the Morville eye darted lightning , he expected that the next moment , '
119819	119834	119817	119817	you	2475	' would be thundered forth , and he could not , with truth , answer '
119837	119862	119817	119817	you	2475	' but it was one of his maxims that a man need never be forced into an open quarrel , and he tranquilly continued : '
119895	119896	119897	119897	I	0	' '
119910	119911	119901	119901	I	0	' '
119914	119951	119901	119901	I	0	' said Philip ; then , while Guy bit his lip till it bled , the pain really a relief , by giving some vent to his anger at the implied doubt , he went on : '
119991	120140	119987	119987	them	2479	' Most people would have resented this as an impertinent proposal , were it only that doing so would have served to conceal the awkward fact that the accounts had not been kept at all . Guy had never been taught to regard exactness in this respect as a duty , had no natural taste for precision , and did not feel responsible to any person ; nor , if he had kept any , could he have shown them , without exposing his uncle . To refuse would , however , be a subterfuge , and after a moment , he made an effort , and confessed he had none to show ; though he knew Philip would despise him for it as a fool , and probably take it as positive evidence against him . It would have been more bearable if Philip would but have said '
120144	120150	119987	119987	them	2479	' instead of drily repeating , '
120153	120173	119987	119987	them	2479	' After a pause , during which Guy was not sufficiently master of himself to speak , Philip added — '
120194	120195	120187	120187	You	2480	' '
120198	120204	120187	120187	You	2480	' and again he paused . '
120265	120266	120267	120267	I	0	' '
120270	120311	120267	120267	I	0	' answered Philip ; who could venture on doing so himself , though for his sister 's sake it was unsafe to trust Mr. Edmonstone , with whom what was not an absolute secret was not a secret at all . '
120336	120349	120400	120400	Guy	150	' Guy did not shrink , as he simply answered—'It is true . '
120350	120372	120400	120400	Guy	150	' Yet you have neither played , nor betted , nor done anything that could come under the definition of gambling ? '
120373	120376	120400	120400	Guy	150	' No . '
120377	120383	120400	120400	Guy	150	' Then why this payment ? '
120384	120398	120400	120400	Guy	150	' I can not explain that . I know appearances are against me , '
120414	120444	120400	120400	Guy	150	' I once thought my simple word would have sufficed ; but since it seems that will not do , I will not again make what you call assertions . '
120445	120474	120409	120409	he	150	' In fact , while you profess a desire to be open and sincere , a mystery appears at every turn . What would you have us do ? '
120475	120481	120482	120482	he	150	' As you think fit , '
120610	120617	120618	120618	he	150	' Since this is your ultimatum , '
120703	120704	120705	120705	I	0	' '
120713	120782	120705	120705	I	0	' answered Guy , his voice stern and dignified ; and the smile that curled his lip was like Philip 's own . Philip was positively annoyed , and desirous to say something to put him down , but he had not committed himself by any vehemence , and Philip was too cool and wise to compromise his own dignity ; so he rose to go , saying , '
120805	120806	120789	120789	I	0	' '
120810	120914	120915	120915	Philip	454	' replied Guy , in the same dignified manner in which he had spoken ever since his passion had been surmounted . They parted , each feeling that matters were just where they were before . Philip went back to his inn , moralizing on the pride and perverseness which made it impossible to make any impression on a Redclyffe Morville , whom not even the fear of detection could lead to submission . Next morning , while Philip was hastily breakfasting , the door opened , and Guy entered , pale and disturbed , as if he had been awake all night . '
120917	120927	120915	120915	Philip	454	' said he , in his frank natural voice , '
120942	120943	120928	120928	I	0	' '
120948	120952	120928	120928	I	0	' thought Philip , '
120964	120969	120960	120960	him	0	' and he said , '
120986	121002	120976	120976	you	454	' then asked if he had breakfasted . He had ; and his cousin added , '
121016	121017	121004	121004	you	454	' '
121057	121058	121049	121049	I	0	' '
121069	121070	121071	121071	I	0	' '
121079	121094	121071	121071	I	0	' said Guy ( an answer rather to the spirit than the words ) , '
121121	121536	121110	121110	you	454	' Philip was puzzled . He wondered whether Guy had come wishing to propitiate him , but had found pride indomitable at the last moment ; or whether he had been showing himself too severely just to admit entreaty . He would be able to judge better after he had made his inquiries , and he proceeded with them at once . He met with no such replies as he expected . Every one spoke of Sir Guy Morville in high terms , strict in his habits of application , and irreproachable in conduct . He was generally liked , and some regret was expressed that he lived in so secluded a manner , forming so few intimacies ; but no one seemed to think it possible that anything wrong could be imputed to him . Philip could even perceive that there was some surprise that such inquiries should be made at all , especially by so young a man as himself . Mr. Wellwood , the person whom he most wished to see , was not at Oxford , but was at home preparing for his ordination . Nor could Philip get nearer to the solution of the mystery when he went to the tradesmen , who were evidently as much surprised as the tutors , and said he always paid in ready money . Captain Morville felt like a lawyer whose case is breaking down , no discoveries made , nothing done ; but he was not one whit convinced of his cousin 's innocence , thinking the college authorities blind and careless , and the tradesmen combined to conceal their extortions , or else that the mischief had been done at St. Mildred 's . He was particularly provoked when he remembered Guy 's invitation to him to come to his rooms , knowing , as he must have done , what would be the result of the inquiry . Philip was conscious that it would have been kind to have gone to say that , so far , he had found nothing amiss , but he did not like giving Guy this passing triumph . It made no difference in his real opinion ; and why renew a useless discussion ? He persuaded himself that he had left himself no time , and should miss the train , and hastened off to the station , where he had to wait a quarter of an hour , consoling himself with reflecting — '
121572	121982	121554	121554	He	2493	' One short year after , what would not Philip have given for that quarter of an hour . By six o'clock he was at St. Mildred 's , greeted with delight by his sister , and with cordiality by Dr. Henley . They were both proud of him , and every tender feeling his sister had , was for Philip , her pet and her pupil in his childhood , and her most valued companion and counsellor through her early womanhood . She had a picked dinner - party to meet him , for she knew the doctor 's conversation was not exactly the thing to entertain him through a whole evening , and the guests might well think they had never seen a handsomer or more clever brother and sister than Mrs. Henley and Captain Morville . The old county families , if they did wonder at her marriage , were always glad to meet her brother , and it was a great pleasure to him to see old friends . Only once did his sister , in the course of the evening , make him feel the difference of their sentiments , and that was about Miss Wellwood . Philip defended her warmly ; and when he heard that there was a plan getting up for excluding her from the hospital , he expressed strong disapprobation at the time ; and after the guests were gone , spoke upon the subject with his sister and her husband . The doctor entered into no party questions , and had only been stirred up to the opposition by his wife ; he owned that the Miss Wellwoods had done a great deal of good , and made the nurses do their duty better than he had ever known , and was quite ready to withdraw his opposition . Mrs. Henley argued about opinions , but Philip was a match for her in her own line ; and the end of it was , that though she would not allow herself to be convinced , and shook her head at her brother 's way of thinking , he knew he had prevailed , and that Miss Wellwood would be unmolested . There was not another person in the world to whom Margaret would have yielded ; and it served to restore him to the sense of universal dominion which had been a little shaken by his conversation with Guy . '
121993	121998	122000	122000	he	150	' said Mrs. Henley . '

122477	122976	122977	122977	James	176	' Mrs. Henley did her best in that way , and Philip followed up his inquiries with great ardour , but still unsuccessfully . Jack White , the hero of the draft , was not at St. Mildred 's , nor likely to be heard of again till the next races ; and whether Sir Guy had been on the race - ground at all was a doubtful point . Next , Philip walked to Stylehurst , to call on Colonel Harewood , and see if he could learn anything in conversation with him ; but the Colonel did not seem to know anything , and his sons were not at home . Young Morville was , he thought , a spirited lad , very good - natured ; he had been out shooting once or twice with Tom , and had a very fine spaniel . If he had been at the races , the Colonel did not know it ; he had had some thoughts of asking him to join their party , but had been prevented . This was no reason , thought Philip , why Guy might not have been with Tom Harewood without the Colonel 's knowledge . Tom was just the man to lead him amongst those who were given to betting ; he might have been drawn in , and , perhaps , he had given some pledge of payment when he was of age , or , possibly , obtained an immediate supply of money from the old steward at Redclyffe , who was devotedly attached to him . If so , Philip trusted to be able to detect it from the accounts ; on the other supposition , there was no hope of discovery . The conversation with Colonel Harewood kept him so late that he had no time for going , as usual , to his old haunts , at Stylehurst ; nor did he feel inclined just then to revive the saddening reflections they excited . He spent the evening in talking over books with his sister , and the next day proceeded on his journey to Thorndale Park . This was one of the places where he was always the most welcome , ever since he had been a school - boy , received in a way especially flattering , considering that the friendship was entirely owing to the uncompromising good sense and real kindness with which he had kept in order the follies of his former fag . Charles might laugh , and call them the young man and young man 's companion , and Guy more classically term them the pious Æneas and his fidus Achates , but it was a friendship that did honour to both ; and the value that the Thorndales set upon Captain Morville was not misplaced , and scarcely over - rated . Not particularly clever themselves , they the more highly appreciated his endowments , and were proud that '
122978	123704	123705	123705	I	0	' had been able to make such a friend ; for they knew , as well as the rest of the world , that Captain Morville was far from seeking the acquaintance for the sake of their situation in life , but that it was from real liking and esteem . How far this esteem was gained by the deference the whole family paid to his opinion , was another question ; at any rate , the courting was from them . The Miss Thorndales deemed Captain Morville the supreme authority in drawing , literature , and ecclesiastical architecture ; and whenever a person came in their way who was thought handsome , always pronounced that he was not by any means equal to James 's friend . Lady Thorndale delighted to talk over James with him , and thank him for his kindness ; and Lord Thorndale , rather a pompous man himself , liked his somewhat stately manners , and talked politics with him , sincerely wishing he was his neighbour at Redclyffe , and calculating how much good he would do there . Philip listened with interest to accounts of how the Thorndale and Morville influence had always divided the borough of Moorworth , and , if united , might dispose of it at will , and returned evasive answers to questions what the young heir of Redclyffe might be likely to do . James Thorndale drove his friend to Redclyffe , as Philip had authority from Mr. Edmonstone to transact any business that might be required with Markham , the steward ; and , as has been said before , he expected to discover in the accounts something that might explain why Guy had ceased to press for the thousand pounds . However , he could find nothing amiss in them , though — bearing in mind that it is less easy to detect the loss of a score of sheep than of one — he subjected them to a scrutiny which seemed by no means agreeable to the gruff old grumbling steward . He also walked about the park , saw to the marking of certain trees that were injuring each other ; and finding that there was a misunderstanding between Markham and the new rector , Mr. Ashford , about certain parish matters , where the clergyman was certainly right , he bore down Markham 's opposition with Mr. Edmonstone 's weight , and felt he was doing good service . He paused at the gate , and looked back at the wide domain and fine old house . He pitied them , and the simple - hearted , honest tenantry , for being the heritage of such a family , and the possession of one so likely to misuse them , instead of training them into the means of conferring benefits on them , on his country . What would not Philip himself do if those lands were his , — just what was needed to give his talents free scope ? and what would it be to see his beautiful Laura their mistress ? Longfellow . After his week at Thorndale Park , Captain Morville returned to make his farewell visit at Hollywell , before joining his regiment at Cork , whence it was to sail for the Mediterranean . He reckoned much on this visit , for not even Laura herself could fathom the depth of his affection for her , strengthening in the recesses where he so sternly concealed it , and viewing her ever as more faultless since she had been his own . While she was his noble , strong - minded , generous , fond Laura , he could bear with his disappointment in his sister , with the loss of his home , and with the trials that had made him a grave , severe man . She had proved the strength of her mind by the self - command he had taught her , and for which he was especially grateful to her , as it made him safer and more unconstrained , able to venture on more demonstration than in those early days when every look had made her blush and tremble . Mr. Edmonstone brought the carriage to fetch him from the station , and quickly began , — '

123922	123926	123919	123919	Charles	156	' exclaimed Philip . '

124162	124172	124174	124175	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' He says it was all his own fault , '
124177	124190	124174	124175	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' and that he should have been actually down but for you . '
124191	124204	124120	124120	Amy	210	' But is it really thought it can have caused this attack ? '
124205	124241	124174	124175	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' I can hardly suppose so ; but Thompson fancies there may have been some jar . However , do n't distress yourself , I dare say it would have come on all the same . '
124380	124387	124389	124389	she	2524	' You bring no good news ? '
124402	124426	124389	124389	she	2524	' Oh ! how I wish you had . It would be such a comfort now . You have heard about poor Charlie ? '
124427	124451	124394	124394	she	2524	' Yes ; and very sorry I am . But , Laura , is it really thought that accident could have occasioned it ? '
124452	124494	124389	124389	she	2524	' Dr. Mayerne does not think so , only Mr. Thompson talked of remote causes , when Amy mentioned it . I do n't believe it did any harm , and Charlie himself says you saved him from falling down stairs . '
124647	124657	124659	124659	Philip	454	' I am very sorry to find you here , '
124679	124686	124659	124659	Philip	454	' Is the pain very bad ? '
124687	124695	124697	124697	Charles	156	' That is a matter of course , '
124712	124729	124706	124706	his	156	' I want to hear what you have been doing at Oxford and St. Mildred 's . '
124730	124743	124659	124659	Philip	454	' I am sorry I do not bring the tidings you wish . '
124744	124773	124775	124775	Charles	156	' I did not expect you would . I know you too well ; but I want to hear what you have been doing — what he said , '
124783	124805	124775	124775	Charles	156	' It can be of no use , Charlie . You are not in a state to enter on agitating subjects . '
124806	124815	124659	124659	Philip	454	' I tell you I will hear all , '
124823	124859	124659	124659	Philip	454	' I know you will say nothing to his advantage that you can help , but still I know you will speak what you think the truth , and I want to judge for myself . '
124860	124873	124775	124775	Charles	156	' You speak as if I was not acting for his good . '
124874	124877	124879	124879	Charles	156	' Palaver ! '
124891	124922	124879	124879	Charles	156	' I want the facts . Begin at the beginning . Sit down — there 's a chair by you . Now tell me , where did you find him ? '
124998	125017	124994	124994	Charles	156	' Pray , what did Guy say when he heard the result of this fine voyage of discovery ? '
125018	125026	124994	124994	Charles	156	' I did not see him again . '
125027	125041	124994	124994	Charles	156	' Not see him ! not tell him he was so far justified ! '
125042	125081	124994	124994	Charles	156	' I had no time — at least I thought not . It would have been useless , for while these mysteries continue , my opinion is unchanged , and there was no benefit in renewing vain disputes . '
125082	125087	125089	125089	Charles	156	' Say no more ! '
125091	125119	125089	125089	Charles	156	' You have said all I expected , and more too . I gave you credit for domineering and prejudice , now I see it is malignity . '
125158	125192	125153	125153	Charles	156	' Now , doctor , give me as much opium as you please . I only want to be stupified till the world has turned round , and then you may wake me . '
125230	125234	125236	125236	Philip	454	' Poor fellow ! '
125248	125268	125236	125236	Philip	454	' He is a very generous partizan , and excitement and suffering make him carry his zeal to excess . '
125269	125280	125321	125321	him	454	' I knew you could not be angry with him . '
125281	125304	125305	125305	Laura	454	' I could not be angry at this time at far more provocation given by any one belonging to you , Laura . '
125341	125344	125346	125346	Charles	156	' Amy , '
125356	125377	125346	125346	Charles	156	' I am more than ever convinced that things will right themselves . I never saw prejudice more at fault . '
125378	125387	125346	125346	Charles	156	' Did he tell you all about it ? '
125388	125427	125346	125346	Charles	156	' I worked out of him all I could , and it is my belief Guy had the best of it . I only wonder he did not horsewhip Philip round the quadrangle . I wish he had . '
125428	125440	125346	125346	Charles	156	' Oh , no , no ! But he controlled himself ? '
125441	125455	125457	125457	Charles	156	' If he had not we should have heard of it fast enough ; '
125999	126006	126011	126011	himself	206	' Ah , my fine fellow ! '
126033	126046	126047	126047	Laura	454	' I see you have not forgotten you are the next heir . '
126053	126056	126059	126059	herself	454	' Oh ! '
126078	126092	126059	126059	herself	454	' Ah ! Miss Edmonstone , I did not know you were there ! '
126093	126110	126112	126112	Charlotte	277	' Yes , you were talking to yourself , just as if you were at home , '
126133	126145	126124	126124	she	277	' You were telling some home truths to make Laura angry . '
126146	126163	126165	126166	the doctor	5336	' Well , he would make a very good use of it if he had it , '
126168	126176	126178	126178	Charlotte	277	' Now you 'll make me angry , '
126180	126204	126178	126178	Charlotte	277	' and you have not mended matters with Laura . She thinks nothing short of four - syllabled words good enough for Philip . '
126205	126212	126214	126214	Laura	454	' Hush ! nonsense , Charlotte ! '
126219	126237	126239	126240	the doctor	5336	' There , Charlotte , she is avenging herself on you because she ca n't scold me , '
126246	126260	126262	126262	Laura	454	' Charlotte is only growing more wild than ever for want of mamma , '
126340	126341	126297	126297	I	0	' '
126352	126414	126345	126345	Philip	454	' said Charlotte , who , at fourteen , had caught much of her brother 's power of repartee , and could be quite as provoking , when unrestrained by any one whom she cared to obey . Laura felt it was more for her dignity not to notice this , and replied , with an effort for a laugh , — '
126436	126437	126427	126427	you	454	' '
126440	126449	126427	126427	you	454	' said Dr. Mayerne , good - humouredly . '
126517	126518	126509	126509	he	454	' '
126523	126527	126509	126509	he	454	' said Charlotte ; '
126541	126665	126531	126531	I	0	' She spoke in a little surly decided tone , as if her opinion put an end to the matter , and Philip 's return closed the discussion . Divided as the party were between upstairs and downstairs , and in the absence of Charles 's shrewd observation , Philip and Laura had more opportunity of intercourse than usual , and now that his departure would put an end to suspicion , they ventured on more openly seeking each other . It never could be the perfect freedom that they had enjoyed before the avowal of their sentiments , but they had many brief conversations , giving Laura feverish , but exquisite , delight at each renewal of his rare expressions of tenderness . '
126676	126691	126668	126668	you	2574	' he asked , on the last morning before he was to leave Hollywell . '
126701	126743	126744	126744	I	0	' She looked down , and he kept his eyes fixed on her rather sternly , for he had never before made a clandestine appointment , and he did not like feeling ashamed of it . At last she said , — '
126763	127065	127066	127066	You	2575	' Mary Ross was still absent ; her six nephews and nieces having taken advantage of her visit to have the measles , not like reasonable children , all at once , so as to be one trouble , but one after the other , so as to keep Aunt Mary with them as long as possible ; and Mr. Ross did not know what would have become of the female department of his parish but for Laura , who worked at school - keeping indefatigably . Laura had some difficulty in shaking off Charlotte 's company this afternoon , and was obliged to make the most of the probability of rain , and the dreadful dirt of the roads . Indeed , she represented it as so formidable , that Mrs. Edmonstone , who had hardly time to look out of window , much less to go out of doors , strongly advised her to stay at home herself ; and Charlotte grew all the more eager for the fun . Luckily , however , for Laura , Dr. Mayerne came in , laughing at the reports of the weather , and as he was wanted to prescribe for a poor old man in an opposite direction , he took Charlotte with him to show the way , and she was much better pleased to have him for a companion than the grave Laura . Philip in the meantime had walked all the way to Broadstone , timing his return exactly , that he might meet Laura as she came out of the school , and feel as if it had been by chance . It was a grey , misty November day , and the leaves of the elm - trees came floating round them , yellow and damp . '
127073	127081	127066	127066	You	2575	' said Laura , as they met . '
127088	127113	127114	127114	She	2576	' he answered , and they proceeded for some minutes in silence , until he said,—'It is time we should come to an understanding . '
127141	127156	127122	127122	his	2575	' I believe that no affection has ever been stronger or truer than ours . '
127157	127161	127163	127163	Laura	454	' Has been ! '
127172	127187	127163	127163	Laura	454	' And is , if you are satisfied to leave things as they are . '
127188	127197	127122	127122	his	2575	' I must be , if you are . '
127198	127281	127122	127122	his	2575	' I will not say I am satisfied with what must be , as I am situated ; but I felt it due to you to set the true state of the case before you . Few would venture their love as I do mine with you , bound in reality , though not formally , with no promise sought or given ; yet I am not more assured that I stand here than I am that our love is for ever . '
127282	127289	127290	127290	she	2577	' I am sure it is ! '
127295	127358	127290	127290	she	2577	' O Philip , there never was a time I did not love you ; and since that day on Ashen Down , I have loved you with my whole heart . I am sometimes afraid it has left no proper room for the rest , when I find how much more I think of your going away than of poor Charles . '
127359	127362	127363	127363	he	2578	' Yes , '
127366	127442	127363	127363	he	2578	' you have understood me as none but you would have done , through coldness and reserve , apparently , even towards yourself , and when to others I have seemed grave and severe beyond my years . You have never doubted , you have recognised the warmth within ; you have trusted your happiness to me , and it shall be safe in my keeping , for , Laura , it is all mine . '
127449	127455	127363	127363	he	2578	' said Laura , timidly ; '
127465	127466	127467	127467	Laura	454	' '
127514	127523	127546	127547	your parents	2580	' She exclaimed , as if with pain . '
127526	127530	127546	127547	your parents	2580	' he answered , '
127548	127638	127546	127547	your parents	2580	' consent ; but it would be giving them and you useless distress and perplexity to ask it now . They would object to my poverty , and we should gain nothing ; for I would never be so selfish as to wish to expose you to such a life as that of the wife of a poor officer ; and an open engagement could not add to our confidence in each other . We must be content to wait for my promotion . By that time'—he smiled gravely — '
127656	127657	127546	127547	your parents	2580	' '

127694	127698	127686	127686	You	454	' sighed Laura ; '

128135	128155	128125	128125	you	0	' said Laura , smiling , and looking half sadly , half proudly , up to his noble features ; '
128164	128375	128378	128378	Amy	210	' After they came near the house , they walked up and down the lane for a long time , for Philip avoided a less public path , in order to keep up his delusion that he was doing nothing in an underhand way . It grew dark , and the fog thickened , straightening Laura 's auburn ringlets , and hanging in dew - drops on Philip 's rough coat , but little recked they ; it was such an hour as they had never enjoyed before . Philip had never so laid himself open , or assured her so earnestly of the force of his affection ; and her thrills of ecstacy overcame the desolate expectation of his departure , and made her sensible of strength to bear seven , ten , twenty years of loneliness and apparent neglect . She knew him , and he would never fail her . Yet , when at last they went in - doors , and Amy followed her to her room , wondering to find her so wet , and so late , who could have seen the two sisters without reading greater peace and serenity in the face of the younger . Philip felt an elder brother 's interest for '
128380	128597	128378	128378	Amy	210	' He did not see much of her ; but he compassionated her as a victim to her mother 's imprudence , hoping she would soon be weaned from her attachment . He thought her a good patient little thing , so soft and gentle as probably not to have the strength and depth that would make the love incurable ; and the better he liked her , the more unfit he thought her for Guy . It would have been uniting a dove and a tiger ; and his only fear was , that when he was no longer at hand , Mr. Edmonstone 's weak good nature might be prevailed on to sacrifice her . He did his best for her protection , by making his uncle express a resolution never to admit Guy into his family again , unless the accusation of gambling was completely disproved . The last morning came , and Philip went to take leave of Charles . Poor Charles was feebler by this time , and too much subdued by pain and languor to receive him as at first , but the spirit was the same ; and when Philip wished him good bye , saying he hoped soon to hear he was better , he returned for answer , '
128622	128725	128612	128612	I	0	' He was in no condition to be answered , and Philip repeated his good bye , little thinking how they were to meet again . The others were assembled in the hall . His aunt 's eyes were full of tears , for she loved him dearly , her brother 's only son , early left motherless , whom she had regarded like her own child , and who had so nobly fulfilled all the fondest hopes . All his overbearing ways and uncalled - for interference were forgotten , and her voice gave way as she embraced him , saying , '
128744	128766	128737	128737	We	2590	' Little Amy 's hand was put into his , and he squeezed it kindly ; but she could hardly speak her '
128769	128808	128812	128812	Philip	454	' for the tears that came , because she was grieved not to feel more sorry that her highly esteemed cousin , so kind and condescending to her , was going away for so very long a time . '
128814	128830	128812	128812	Philip	454	' said Charlotte I shall be quite grown up by the time you come home . '

129845	129869	129842	129843	the coachman	2623	' and well you may . There 's not a more noted place for thieves and vagabonds . They call it Coombe Prior . '

He did not wonder now that his own hopes of happiness had been blighted ; he only marvelled that a bright present or future had ever been his — While souls were wandering far and wide , And curses swarmed on every side . The traveller was , meanwhile , observing the heir of Redclyffe , possessor of wealth and wide lands . Little did he guess how that bright - eyed youth looked upon his riches . Miles were passed in one long melancholy musing , till Guy was roused by the sight of familiar scenes , and found himself rattling over the stones of the little borough of Moorworth , with the grey , large - windowed , old - fashioned houses , on each side , looking at him with friendly eyes . There , behind those limes cut out in arches , was the commercial school , where he had spent many an hour in construing with patient Mr. Potts ; and though he had now a juster appreciation of his old master 's erudition , which he had once thought so vast , he recollected with veneration his long and patient submission to an irksome , uncongenial life . Rumbling on , the coach was in the square market - place , the odd - looking octagon market - house in the middle , and the inn — the respectable old '

And a precious bad lot they are there , too ! There were actually three of them poaching in Cliffstone hanger this autumn ; but we have them in jail . A pretty pass of impudence to be coming that distance to poach ! '

131576	131601	131556	131556	Markham	157	' He took up some unjust suspicion of me . I could not bear it patiently , and said something that has offended him . '

131699	131739	131471	131471	Markham	157	' He thinks he has proof against me . I ca n't guess how he discovered it ; but I was obliged to pay some money to a gambling sort of man , and he thinks I lost it . '
131740	131751	131471	131471	Markham	157	' Then why do n't you show him your accounts ? '
131752	131763	131471	131471	Markham	157	' For one reason — because I have kept none . '

Nothing had been done to alter its old , familiar aspect , except lighting a fire , which he had never seen there before . There were all his boyish treasures , his bows and arrows , his collection of birds '

Who hath the Father and the Son , May be left , but not alone . Longfellow . Mr. Ashford was a connexion of Lady Thorndale 's , and it was about a year since the living of Redclyffe had been presented to him . Mr. and Mrs. Ashford were of course anxious to learn all they could about their young squire , on whom the welfare of the parish depended , even more than in most cases , as the whole was his property . Their expectations were not raised by Mr. Markham 's strenuous opposition to all their projects , and his constant appeals to the name of '
134534	134588	134531	134532	Sir Guy	150	' but , on the other hand , they were pleased by the strong feeling of affection that all the villagers manifested for their landlord . The inhabitants of Redclyffe were a primitive race , almost all related to each other , rough and ignorant , and with a very strong feudal feeling for '
134592	134612	134589	134590	Sir Guy	150	' who was king , state , supreme authority , in their eyes ; and Mrs. Ashford further found that '
134616	134903	134904	134904	Mamma	155	' as the old women called him in his individual character , was regarded by them with great personal affection . On the occasion when Captain Morville came to Redclyffe , and left James Thorndale to spend a couple of hours at the parsonage , they interrogated the latter anxiously on his acquaintance with Sir Guy . He had not the least idea of creating prejudice , indeed , he liked him as a companion , but he saw everything through the medium of his friend , and spoke something to this effect : He was very agreable ; they would like his manners ; he was tolerably clever , but not to be named in the same day with his cousin for abilities , far less in appearance . Very pleasant , generally liked , decidedly a taking man ; but there was some cloud over him just now — debts , probably . Morville had been obliged to go to Oxford about it ; but Mr. Thorndale did not profess to understand it , as of course Morville said as little of it as he could . Thereupon all began to admire the aforesaid Morville , already known by report , and whose fine countenance and sensible conversation confirmed all that had been said of him . And as , after his interference , Mr. Markham 's opposition became surly , as well as sturdy , and Sir Guy 's name was sure to stand arrayed against them whichever way they turned , the younger part of the family learnt to regard him somewhat in the light of an enemy , and their elders awaited his majority with more of fear than of hope .

135928	137016	137017	137018	Poor thing	2799	' Before Mr. Ashford could answer , the boys made such an uproar at the proposal of bringing a stranger to spoil their Christmas , that their parents gave up the idea . It was that Christmas day that Guy especially dreaded , as recalling so many contrasts both with those passed here and at Hollywell . Since his return , he had been exerting himself to attend to what he felt to be his duty , going about among his people , arranging for their good or pleasure , and spending a good deal of time over his studies . He had written to Mr. Ross , to ask his advice about Coombe Prior , and had set Markham , much against his will , to remonstrate with Farmer Todd about the repairs ; but though there was a sort of satisfaction in doing these things ; though the attachment of his dependents soothed him , and brought a new sense of the relation between himself and them ; though views of usefulness were on each side opening before him ; yet there was a dreariness about everything ; he was weary even while he undertook and planned energetically ; each new project reminding him that there was no Amy to plan with him . He could not sufficiently care for them . Still more dreary was his return to his old haunts , and to the scenery which he loved so devotedly , the blue sea and purple hills which had been like comrades and playfellows , before he had known what it was to have living companions . They used to be everything to him , and he had scarcely a wish beyond ; afterwards his dreams had been of longing affection for them , and latterly the idea of seeing Amy love them and admire them had been connected with every vision of them ; and now the sight of the reality did but recal the sense that their charm had departed ; they could no longer suffice to him as of old , and their presence brought back to him with fresh pangs of disappointment the thought of lost happiness and ruined hopes , as if Amy alone could restore their value . The depression of his spirits inclined him to dwell at present more on the melancholy history of his parents than on anything else . He had hitherto only heard the brief narration of his grandfather , when he could ask no questions , but he now obtained full particulars from Markham , who , when he found him bent on hearing all , related everything , perhaps intending it as a warning against the passions which , when once called into force , he dreaded to find equally ungovernable in his present master . Mr. Morville had been his great pride and glory , and , in fact , had been so left to his care as to have been regarded like a son of his own . He had loved him , if possible , better than Guy , because he had been more his own ; he had chosen his school , and given him all the reproofs which had ever been bestowed on him with his good in view ; and how he had grieved for him was never known to man . It was the first time he had ever talked it over ; and he described , with strong , deep feeling , the noble face and bearing of the dark - eyed , gallant - looking stripling , his generosity and high spirit tainted and ruined by his wild temper and impatience of restraint . There seemed to have been a great sweetness of disposition , excellent impulses , and so strong a love of his father , in spite of early neglect and present resentment , as showed what he might have been with only tolerable training , which gave Guy 's idea of him more individuality than it had ever had before , and made him better understand what his unhappy grandfather 's remorse had been . Guy doubted for a moment whether it had not been selfish to make Markham narrate the history of the time when he had suffered so much ; and Markham , when he had been led into telling it , and saw the deepening sadness on his young master 's countenance , wished it had not been told , and ended by saying it was of no use to stir up what was better forgotten . He would have regretted the telling it still more if he had known how Guy acted it all over in his solitude , picturing his father standing an outcast at the door of his own home , yielding his pride and resentment for the sake of his wife , ready to do anything , yearning for reconciliation , longing to tread once more the friendly , familiar hall , and meeting only the angry repulse and cruel taunt ! He imagined the headlong passion , the despair , the dashing on his horse in whirlwind -like swiftness ; then the blow , the fall , the awful stillness of the form , carried back to his father 's house , and laid on that table a dead man ! Fierce wrath , — then another world ! Guy worked himself up in imagining the horror of the scene , till it was almost as if he had been an actor in it . Yet he had never cared so much for the thought of his father as for his mother . His yearning for her which he had felt in early days at Hollywell , had returned in double force , as he now fancied that she would have been here to comfort him , and to share his grief , to be a Mrs. Edmonstone , whose love no fault and no offence could ever cancel . He rode to Moorworth , and made Mrs. Lavers tell him all she remembered . She was nothing loth , and related how she had been surprised by Mr. Morville arriving with his fair , shrinking young wife , and how she had rejoiced in his coming home again . She described Mrs. Morville with beautiful blue eyes and flaxen hair , looking pale and delicate , and with clinging , caressing ways like a little child afraid to be left . '
137020	137029	137017	137018	Poor thing	2799	' said Mrs. Lavers , wiping her eyes ; '
137122	137146	137113	137113	he	2800	' There , there , Marianne , that will do . Only be a good child , and I 'll come for you . '

137486	137498	137500	137500	she	2799	' said Guy , looking up , after a long silence . '
137510	137511	137500	137500	she	2799	' '
137566	137570	137562	137562	her	2799	' Mr. Morville , '

137675	137694	137670	137670	you	402	' said Guy , his face , mournful before , lighting up in a sudden beam of gratitude . '
137709	137710	137700	137700	you	150	' '
137715	137736	137713	137713	sir	899	' said Mrs. Lavers , smiling , and looking pleased , though as if but half entering into his meaning . '
137817	138227	138228	138228	Guy	150	' Guy soon after set out on his homeward ride . His yearning to hear of his mother had been satisfied ; but though he could still love the fair , sweet vision summoned up by her name , he was less disposed to feel that it had been hard upon him that she died . It was not Amy . In spite of his tender compassion and affection , he knew that he had not lost a Verena in her . None could occupy that place save Amy ; and his mind , from custom , reverted to Amy as still his own , thrilled like a freshly touched wound , and tried to realize the solace that even yet she might be praying for him . It was dreariness and despondency by day , and he struggled with it by energy and occupation ; but it was something even worse in the evening , in the dark , solitary library , where the very size of the room gave an additional sense of loneliness ; and in the silence he could hear , through the closed shutters , the distant plash and surge of the tide,—a sound of which in former years he had never been sensible . There , evening after evening , he sat,—his attention roaming from his employment to feed on his sad reflections . One evening he went to the large dark dining - room , unlocked the door , which echoed far through the house , and found his way through the packed - up furniture to a picture against the wall , to which he held up his light . It was a portrait , by Lely , a half - length of a young man , one hand on his sword , the other holding his plumed hat . His dark chestnut hair fell on each side of a bright youthful face , full of life and health , and with eyes which , even in painting , showed what their vividness must have been . The countenance was full of spirit and joy ; but the mouth was more hard and stern than suited the rest ; and there was something in the strong determined grasp of the sword which made it seem as if the hand might be a characteristic portrait . In the corner of the picture was the name—'Hugo Morville . Æt . 20 , 1671 . '
138273	138292	138268	138268	he	150	' He , too , would have said—'Is thy servant a dog , that he should do this ? ''
139167	139174	139176	139176	he	150	' You see , Sir Guy , '
139178	139199	139176	139176	he	150	' there was some of us thought you might not like to have us coming and singing like old times , 'cause

139278	139300	139263	139263	Guy	150	' I had rather hear the carols than anything . Come to the front door ; I 'll let you in . '

140746	140765	140744	140744	he	150	' If you would let me , I should like to join you at your tea - time . '
140766	140776	140778	140779	Mr. Ashford	376	' If you will endure a host of children , '
140781	140790	140792	140792	Guy	150	' I should like it of all things , '
140794	140803	140805	140805	he	150	' I want to make acquaintance very much , '
140814	140844	140805	140805	he	150	' Besides , I want to talk to you about the singing , and how we are to get rid of that fiddle without breaking James Robinson 's heart . '
141288	141299	141301	141301	Edward	395	' But we should have to go through the park , '
141312	141318	141306	141306	Guy	150	' Well , why not ? '
141319	141328	141330	141331	the children	1174	' We must not go into the park ! '
141336	141343	141345	141345	Guy	150	' Not go into the park ! '

There was continually a rushing home with a joyous outcry,—'Mamma ! Sir Guy gave me a ride on his horse ! '
141520	141535	141417	141417	him	157	' Mamma ! Sir Guy helped us to the top of that great rock ! '

141588	141620	141417	141417	him	157	' Papa ! papa ! Sir Guy showed us his boat , and he says he will take us out to the Shag Rock , if you will give us leave ! '

141828	141889	141825	141825	he	150	' perhaps we shall manage it in the summer . We will get your father to go out with us himself , and , in the meantime , who likes to come with me after the rabbits in Cliffstone Copse ? Farmer Holt will thank Robin for killing a dozen or so , for he makes grievous complaints of them . '
141947	141954	141956	141956	Guy	150	' Ca n't you forget it ? '
141960	141993	141956	141956	Guy	150	' You have no loss , after all , for we are likely to have no boating weather this long time . Hark ! do n't you hear the ground - swell ? '
141994	141999	142001	142002	the boys	6987	' What 's that ? '
142038	142049	142051	142051	Guy	150	' It is the sound that comes before stormy weather , '
142053	142069	142051	142051	Guy	150	' it is as if the sea was gathering up its forces for the tempest . '
142070	142081	142083	142083	Robin	408	' But what?—how ? Tell me what it really is , '
142085	142101	142103	142103	Guy	150	' I suppose it is the wind on the sea before it has reached us , '
142105	142111	142103	142103	Guy	150	' How solemn it is ! '
142335	142338	143532	143532	you	2908	' glorious voice '
142343	143530	143532	143532	you	2908	' thought what an awful night at sea , and remembered when he used to fancy it would be the height of felicity to have a shipwreck at Redclyffe , and shocked Mrs. Bernard by inhuman wishes that a ship would only come and be wrecked . How often had he watched , through sounds like these , for a minute gun ! nay , he had once actually called up poor Arnaud in the middle of the night for an imaginary signal . Redclyffe bay was a very dangerous one , a fine place for a wreck , with its precipitous crags , its single safe landing - place , and the great Shag Stone on the eastern side , with a whole progeny of nearly sunken rocks , dreaded in rough weather by the fishermen themselves ; but it was out of the ordinary track of vessels , and there were only a few traditions of terrible wrecks , long before his time . It seemed as if he had worked up his fancy again , for the sound of a gun was for a moment in his ear . It was lost in the rush of hail against the window , and the moaning of the wind round the old house ; but presently it returned , too surely to be imaginary . He sprang to the window , and the broad , flickering glare of lightning revealed the black cliff and pale sea - line ; then all was dark and still , while the storm was holding its breath for the thunder - burst which in a few more seconds rolled overhead , shaking door and window throughout the house . As the awful sound died away , in the moment 's lull , came the gun again . He threw up the window , and as the blast of wind and rain swept howling into the room , it brought another report . To close the window , light his candle , throw on his clothes , and hasten down stairs , was the work of a very few seconds . Luckily , the key of the boat - house was lying on the table in the hall , where he had left it , after showing the boat to the Ashford boys ; he seized it , caught up the pocket - telescope , put on a rough coat , and proceeded to undo the endless fastenings of the hall - door , a very patience - trying occupation ; and when completed , the gusts that were eddying round the house , ready to force their way in everywhere , took advantage of the first opening to blow out his candle . However , they had in one way done good service , for the shower had been as brief as it was violent , and the inky cloud was drifting away furiously towards the east , leaving the moon visible , near her setting , and allowing her white cold light to shine forth , contrasting with the distant sheets of pale lightning , growing fainter and fainter . Guy ran across the court , round to the west side of the house , and struggled up the slope in the face of the wind , which almost swept him down again , and when at length he had gained the summit , came rushing against him with such force that he could hardly stand . He did , however , keep his ground , and gazed out over the sea . The swell was fearful , marked by the silver light on one side , where it caught the moonbeams , and the black shade on the other , ever alternating , so that the eye could not fix on them for a moment ; the spray leapt high in its whiteness , and the Shag stood up hard , bold , and black . The waves thundered , bursting on the cliff ; and , high as he stood , the spray dashed almost blinding in his face , while the wind howled round him , as if gathering its might for the very purpose of wrenching him from the cliff ; but he stood firm , and looked out again , to discern clearly what he thought he had seen . It was the mast of a vessel , seen plainly against the light silvery distance of sea on the reef west of the Shag . It was in a slanting direction , and did not move ; he could not doubt that the ship had struck on the dangerous rocks at the entrance of the bay ; and as his eyes became more accustomed to the unusual light , and made out what objects were or were not familiar , he could perceive the ship herself . He looked with the glass , but could see no one on board , nor were any boats in sight ; but observing some of the lesser rocks , he beheld some moving figures on them . Help!—instant help!—was his thought ; and he looked towards the Cove . Lights were in the cottage windows , and a few sounds came up to him , as if the fishing population were astir . He hastened to the side of the cliff , which was partly clothed with brushwood . There was a descent — it could hardly be called a path — which no one ventured to attempt but himself and a few of the boldest birds'-nesting boys of the village ; but he could lose no time , and scrambling , leaping , swinging himself by the branches , he reached the foot of the cliff in safety , and in five minutes more was on the little quay at the end of the steep street of the Cove . The quay was crowded with the fisher - people , and there was a strange confusion of voices , some saying all was lost ; some , that the crew had got to the rock ; others , that some one ought to put off and help them ; others , that a boat would never live in such a sea , and an old telescope was in great requisition . Ben Robinson , a tall , hardy young man , of five - and - twenty , wild , reckless , high - spirited , and full of mischief and adventure , was standing on a pile at the extreme verge above the foaming water , daring the others to go with him to the rescue ; and though Jonas Ledbury , a feeble old man , was declaring , in a piteous tone , it was a sin and a shame to let so many poor creatures be lost in sight , without one man stirring to help them , yet all stood irresolute , watching the white breakers dashing on the Shag , and the high waves that swelled and rolled between . '
143539	143561	143532	143532	you	2908	' exclaimed Guy , shouting as loud as he could , for the noise of the winds and waves was tremendous . '
143572	143581	143564	143564	sir	899	' said the fortunate possessor of the telescope . '

143682	143821	143657	143657	I	0	' It was an important question , for the rocks round the Shag were covered before full tide , even when the water was still . There was a looking up at the moon , and then Guy and the fishermen simultaneously exclaimed , that it would be in three hours ; which gave scarcely an hour to spare . Without another word , Guy sprang from the quay to the boat - house , unlocked it , and , by example , showed that the largest boat was to be brought out . The men helped him vigorously , and it stood on the narrow , pebbly beach , the only safe landing - place in the whole bay ; he threw into it a coil of rope and called out in his clear , commanding voice , '
143828	143911	143657	143657	I	0	' Hanging back was at an end . They were brave men , who had wanted nothing but a leader ; and with Sir Guy at their head , were ready for anything . Not five , but five - and - twenty , were at his command ; and even in the hurry of the moment , a strong , affectionate feeling filled his eyes with tears as he saw these poor fellows ready to trust their lives in his hands . '
143918	143922	143916	143916	you	2916	' he exclaimed . '
143945	143973	143942	143943	Wat Green	413	' They were all young men , without families , such as could best be spared ; and , each as his name was called , answered , '
143979	143990	143976	143977	Sir Guy	150	' and came forward with a resolute , satisfied air . '
144001	144005	144006	144007	Mr. Brown	414	' said Guy . '
144009	144017	144006	144007	Mr. Brown	414	' to the owner of the telescope , '
144023	144044	144046	144046	he	414	' tis the strongest and lightest . Thank you . Martin had best steer it , he knows the rocks ; '
144088	144101	144074	144079	A tall , athletic young fisherman	2920	' Please your honour , Sir Guy , may not I go ? '
144102	144108	144110	144110	Guy	150	' Better not , Jem , '
144112	144115	144110	144110	Guy	150	' Remember , '

144138	144156	144133	144133	he	414	' Jack Horn , you pull a good oar ! Now , then , are we ready ? '
144157	144163	144133	144133	he	414	' All ready,—yes , sir ! '
144410	144427	144435	144435	Markham	157	' So , Mr. Markham , you are on your way to see about this wreck . '
144428	144433	144435	144435	Markham	157	' Why , ay , '
144452	144489	144435	144435	Markham	157	' I must be there , or that boy will be in the thickest of it . Wherever is mischief , there is he . I only wonder he has not broken his neck long ago . '
144490	144498	144435	144435	Markham	157	' By mischief , you mean danger ? '
144499	144528	144435	144435	Markham	157	' Yes . I hope he has not heard of this wreck , for if he has , no power on earth would keep him back from it . '
144622	144627	144610	144620	those who were striving to keep their eyes on the boats	2939	' There 's one ! '
144628	144631	144610	144620	those who were striving to keep their eyes on the boats	2939	' No ! '
144632	144635	144610	144620	those who were striving to keep their eyes on the boats	2939	' Yes , '

144651	144655	144648	144649	Sir Guy	150	' exclaimed Markham . '
144716	144852	144855	144855	sir	899	' Markham seemed to derive some relief from railing at the fishermen singly and collectively , while Mr. Ashford tried to learn the real facts , and gather opinions as to the chance of safety . The old fishermen held that there was frightful risk , though the attempt was far from hopeless ; they said the young men were all good at their oars , Sir Guy knew the rocks very well , and the chief fear was , that he might not know how to steer in such a sea ; but they had seen that , though daring , he was not rash . They listened submissively to Mr. Markham , but communicated in an under tone to the vicar how vain it would have been to attempt to restrain Sir Guy . '
144857	144863	144864	144864	he	2944	' said old James Robinson , '
144898	144899	144889	144889	he	2944	' '

144981	144994	144979	144979	sir	899	' said the old man , with a pleased yet melancholy look . '
145045	145172	145043	145043	Ben	243	' The shower rushed over them again , shorter and less violent than the former one , but driving in most of the crowd , and only leaving on the quay the vicar , the steward , and a few of the most anxious fishermen . They could see nothing ; for the dark , slanting line of rain swept over the waves , joining together the sea and thick low cloud , and the roaring of the sea and moaning of the wind were fearful . No one spoke , till at last the black edges of the Shag loomed clearer , the moon began to glance through the skirts of the cloud , and the heaving and tossing of the sea became more discernible . '
145177	145187	145043	145043	Ben	243	' shouted young Jem , the widow 's son . '
145191	145192	145043	145043	Ben	243	' '
145195	145196	145043	145043	Ben	243	' '
145208	145212	145043	145043	Ben	243	' cried Markham . '
145221	145225	145217	145217	I	0	' said Jem . '
145236	145259	145231	145232	Mr. Brown	414	' Markham was trying to fix his own , but neither hand nor eye were steady enough ; he muttered,—'Hang the glass ! '
145299	145307	145309	145309	he	157	' It is the same over again ! '
145311	145372	145309	145309	he	157	' He is the age his father was , though Mr. Morville never was such as he — never,—how should he ? He is the last of them — the best — he would have been — he was . Would to heaven I was with him , that , if he is lost , we might all go together . '
145373	145378	145380	145380	Jem	405	' There , sir , '
145396	145418	145380	145380	Jem	405	' they be as far now as opposite West Cove . Do n't you see them , in that light place . '
145524	145547	145501	145502	Mr. Ashford	376	' There is some one out of the boat , climbing on the rocks . Can you make him out , Jem ? '
145548	145555	145557	145558	Mr. Brown	414	' I see , I see , '
145560	145581	145557	145558	Mr. Brown	414	' there are two of them . They are climbing along the lee side of the long ridge of rocks . '
145582	145587	145589	145590	old Ledbury	245	' Ay , ay , '
145592	145616	145589	145590	old Ledbury	245	' they ca n't get in a boat close to the flat rocks , they must take out a line . Bold fellows ! '
145617	145623	145625	145626	Mr. Ashford	376	' Where are the boats ? '
145628	145634	145636	145636	Ledbury	245	' I can tell that , '
145638	145712	145636	145636	Ledbury	245	' they must have got under the lee of the lesser Shag . There 's a ring there that Sir Guy had put in to moor his boat to . They 'll be made fast there , and those two must be taking the rope along that ledge , so as for the poor fellows on the rook to have a hold of , as they creep along to where the boats are . '
145713	145718	145720	145721	Mr. Ashford	376	' Those broken rocks ! '
145723	145736	145720	145721	Mr. Ashford	376	' Can there be a footing , and in such a sea ? '
145737	145749	145751	145751	Robinson	405	' Can you give a guess who they be , sir ? '
145755	145771	145751	145751	Robinson	405	' If you 'd only let Jem have a look , maybe he could guess . '
145780	145811	145813	145814	Sir Guy	150	' Hollo ! what a sea ! I see them now . That 's Ben , going last — I know his red cap . And the first — why , '
145817	145818	145815	145815	himself	150	' '
145828	145834	145826	145826	Jem	405	' cried Markham , angrily . '
145845	145874	145877	145877	I	0	' But when it was restored , Markham went on spying in silence , while Brown , keeping fast possession of his own telescope , communicated his observations . '
145906	145913	145905	145905	they	2960	're alive ! I do n't see 'em
145932	146223	145899	145899	them	2960	' So they watched till , after an interval , in which the boats disappeared behind the rocks , they were seen advancing over the waters again — one — yes — both , and loaded . They came fast , they were in sight of all , growing larger each moment , mounting on the crest of the huge rolling waves , then plunged in the trough so long as to seem as if they were lost , then rising — rising high as mountains . Over the roaring waters came at length the sound of voices , a cheer , pitched in a different key from the thunder of wind and wave ; they almost fancied they knew the voice that led the shout . Such a cheer as rose in answer , from all the Redclyffe villagers , densely crowded on quay , and beach , and every corner of standing ground . The sun was just up , his beams gilded the crests of the leaping waves , and the spray danced up , white and gay , round the tall rocks , whose shadow was reflected in deep green , broken by the ever moving swell . The Shag and its attendant rocks , and the broken vessel , were bathed in the clear morning light ; the sky was of a beautiful blue , with magnificent masses of dark cloud , the edges , where touched by the sun beams , of a pearly white ; and across the bay , tracing behind them glittering streams of light , came up the two boats , with their freight of rescued lives . Martin 's boat was the first to touch the landing - place . '
146227	146231	145899	145899	them	2960	' he said , '
146237	146301	145899	145899	them	2960	' pointing back to Sir Guy . There was no time for questions ; the wan , drenched sailors had to be helped on shore , and the boat hauled up out of the way . In the meantime , Guy , as he steered in past the quay , smiled and nodded to Mr. Ashford and Markham , and renewed the call , '
146305	146402	146405	146405	Jem	405	' Mr. Ashford thought he had never seen anything brighter than his face — the eyes radiant in the morning sun , the damp hair hanging round it , and life , energy , and promptitude in every feature and movement . The boat came in , the sailors were assisted out , partly by their rescuers , partly by the spectators . Guy stood up , and , with one foot on the seat , supported on his knee and against his arm , a little boy , round whom his great coat was wrapt . '
146407	146427	146405	146405	Jem	405	' he shouted , to his rejected volunteer , who had been very active in bringing in the boat , '
146472	146512	146469	146470	Mr. Gregson	418	' Jem received the boy as tenderly as he was given ; and , with one bound , Guy was by the side of his two friends . Mr. Ashford shook hands with heartfelt gratulation , Markham exclaimed , — '
146559	146560	146563	146563	you	0	' '
146573	146578	146563	146563	you	0	' said Mr. Ashford . '

146620	146627	146613	146613	I	0	' answered Markham , almost surly . '

146668	146672	146655	146655	I	0	' said Guy ; '
146699	147062	146692	146693	no one	567	' Mr. Gregson , the doctor , was already present , and no one who had any authority could do anything but attend to the disposal of the shipwrecked crew . Mr. Ashford went one way , Markham another , Guy a third ; but , between one cottage and another , Mr. Ashford learnt some particulars . The crew had been found on a flat rock , and the fishermen had at first thought all their perils in vain , for it was impossible to bring the boats up , on account of the rocks , which ran out in a long reef . Sir Guy , who knew the place , steered to the sheltered spot where he had been used to make fast his own little boat , and undertook to make his way from thence to the rock where the crew had taken refuge , carrying a rope to serve as a kind of hand - rail , when fastened , from one rock to the other . Ben insisted on sharing his peril , and they had crept along the slippery , broken reefs , lashed by the surge , for such a distance that the fishermen shuddered as they spoke of the danger of being torn off by the force of the waves , and dashed against the rocks . Nothing else could have saved the crew . They had hardly accomplished the passage through the rising tide , even with the aid of the rope and the guidance of Sir Guy and Ben , and , before the boats had gone half a mile on their return , the surge was tumbling furiously over the stones where they had been found . The sailors were safely disposed of , in bed , or by the fireside , the fishers vying in services to them . Mr. Ashford went to the cottage of Charity Ledbury , Jem 's mother , to inquire for the boy with the broken arm . As he entered the empty kitchen , the opposite door of the stairs was opened , and Guy appeared , stepping softly , and speaking low . '
147067	147071	147072	147072	he	2976	' he said ; '

147169	147179	147160	147161	The captain	1323	' I wonder what time of day it is ? '
147180	147238	147256	147256	Guy	150	' Past eight . Ah ! there is the bell beginning . I was thinking of going to tell Master Ray we are not too much excited to remember church - going this morning ; but I am glad he has found it out only ten minutes too late . I must make haste . Good bye ! '
147239	147254	147256	147256	Guy	150	' May not I come too , or am I too strange a figure ? '
147275	147279	147281	147282	Mr. Ashford	376	' May you ? '
147286	147297	147281	147282	Mr. Ashford	376	' Is it wise , with all your wet things ? '
147298	147306	147308	147308	Guy	150	' I am not given to colds , '
147341	147342	147321	147321	he	376	' '
147348	147357	147345	147345	I	0	' said Mr. Ashford , with much emotion . '
147365	147366	147321	147321	he	376	' '
147370	147383	147321	147321	he	376	' said Guy , as if the strong feeling would show itself . '
147416	147479	147480	147480	You	376	' He spoke very simply , as if he could not help it , with his eye fixed on the clear eastern sky , and with a tone of grave awe and thankfulness which greatly struck Mr. Ashford , from the complete absence of self - consciousness , or from any attempt either to magnify or depreciate his sense of the danger . '
147495	147496	147480	147480	You	376	' '
147575	147576	147599	147599	one	5249	' '
147583	147584	147599	147599	one	5249	' '
147662	147663	147652	147652	one	5249	' '
147667	147723	147652	147652	one	5249	' was Mr. Ashford 's answer , as he turned his head at the church wicket ; and , at a short distance behind , Guy saw Ben himself walking up the path , with his thankful , happy father , a sight that had not been seen for months , nay , for years . '
147726	147730	147776	147777	a leader	6217	' he said , '
147760	147761	147776	147777	a leader	6217	' '
147764	147769	147776	147777	a leader	6217	' thought Mr. Ashford , '
147799	148205	147776	147777	a leader	6217	' After church , Guy walked fast away ; Mr. Ashford went home , made a long breakfast , having the whole story to tell , and was off to the scene of action again , where he found the master , quite restored , and was presently joined by Markham . Of Sir Guy , there was no news , except that Jem Ledbury said he had looked in after church to know how the cabin - boy was going on , and the master , understanding that he had been the leader in the rescue , was very anxious to thank him , and walked up to the house with Markham and Mr. Ashford . Markham conducted them straight to the library , the door of which was open . He crossed the room , smiled , and made a sign to Mr. Ashford , who looked in some surprise and amusement . It has been already said that the room was so spacious that the inhabited part looked like a little encampment by the fire , though the room was so spacious that the inhabited part looked like a little encampment by the fire , though the round table was large , and the green leather sofa and arm - chair were cumbrous . However , old Sir Guy 's arm - chair was never used by his grandson ; Markham might sit there , and Bustle did sometimes , but Guy always used one of the unpretending , unluxurious chairs , which were the staple of the room . This , however , was vacant , and on the table before it stood the remains of breakfast , a loaf reduced to half its dimensions , an empty plate and coffee - cup . The fire was burnt down to a single log , and on the sofa , on all the various books with which it was strewed , lay Guy , in anything but a comfortable position , his head on a great dictionary , fairly overcome with sleep ; his very thick , black eyelashes resting on his fresh , bright cheek , and the relaxation of the grave expression of his features making him look even younger than he really was . He was so sound asleep that it was not till some movement of Markham 's that he awoke , and started up , exclaiming , — '
148216	148217	148211	148211	I	0	' '
148223	148227	148228	148228	I	0	' said Markham . '
148251	148252	148253	148253	I	0	' '
148261	148265	148253	148253	I	0	' said Guy ; '
148275	148330	148253	148253	I	0	' Then , perceiving the captain , he came forward , hoping he was quite recovered . The captain stood mystified , for he could not believe this slim youth could be the Sir Guy of whose name he had heard so much , and , after answering the inquiry , he began , — '
148342	148343	148339	148340	Sir Guy	150	' '
148346	148350	148351	148351	I	0	' said Guy . '
148358	148368	148351	148351	I	0	' said the captain , while they all laught ; '
148387	148408	148409	148409	he	0	' tis what any man might be proud of having done , and — I never saw anything like it ! '
148417	148436	148409	148409	he	0	' and it will do you honour everywhere . All our lives are owing to you , sir . '
148817	148828	148830	148830	she	403	' I have had very few letters even from Hollywell , '
148832	148850	148830	148830	she	403	' I suppose it is on account of Charles 's illness . You think him really better ? '
148851	148875	149224	149224	he	3023	' Yes , much better . I forgot to tell you , you are wanted for their Christmas party to - morrow night . '
148876	148900	149224	149224	he	3023	' Oh ! he is well enough for them not to put it off ! Is he able to be out of bed ? '
148901	149024	148830	148830	she	403	' No , he lies perfectly flat , and looks very thin . It has been a very severe illness . I do n't think I ever knew him suffer so much , but , at the same time , I never knew him behave so well , or show so much patience , and consideration for other people . I was the more surprised , because at first he seemed to have relapsed into all the ways we thought he had shaken off ; he was so irritable and fretful , that poor Mrs. Edmonstone looked worn out ; but it seems to have been only the beginning of the illness ; it was very different after he was laid up . '
149025	149034	148830	148830	she	403	' Has he had you to see him ? '
149035	149077	149224	149224	he	3023	' Yes , he asked for it , which he never did before , and Amabel reads to him every morning . There is certainly much more that is satisfactory about those young Edmonstones than there once seemed reason to expect . '
149078	149101	149224	149224	he	3023	' And now tell me about Sir Guy . What is the matter ? Why does he not come home this winter ? '
149102	149161	148830	148830	she	403	' I can not tell you the rights of it , Mary . Mr. Edmonstone is very much offended about something he is reported to have said , and suspects him of having been in mischief at St. Mildred 's , but I am not at all persuaded that it is not one of Mr. Edmonstone 's affronts . '
149162	149167	149224	149224	he	3023	' Where is he ? '
149168	149222	149224	149224	he	3023	' At Redeclyffe . I have a letter from him which I am going to answer to - night . I shall tell the Edmonstones about it , for I can not believe that , if he had been guilty of anything very wrong , his mind would be occupied in this manner ; '
149230	149235	149237	149237	Mary	403	' Oh , no ! '
149243	149282	149237	149237	Mary	403	' I am sure he can not be in mischief . What an admirable person he is ! I am very sorry this cloud has arisen ! I was thinking last summer how happy they all were together . '
149283	149307	149224	149224	he	3023	' Either this or Charles 's illness has cast a gloom on the whole house . The girls are both grown much graver . '
149308	149312	149314	149314	Mary	403	' Amy graver ? '
149318	149366	149314	149314	Mary	403	' I think so . At least , she did not seem to cheer up as I should have expected when her brother grew better . She looks as if she had been nursing him too closely , and yet I see her walking a good deal . '
149367	149372	149374	149374	Mary	403	' Poor little Amy ! '
149616	149621	149623	149623	Mary	403	' You look tired , '
149627	149635	149637	149637	Amy	210	' No , it is only stupidity , '
149643	149652	149637	149637	Amy	210	' We ca n't be entertaining without Charlie . '
149653	149661	149663	149663	Mary	403	' It has been a melancholy winter , '
149715	149716	149713	149713	Mary	403	' '
149726	149737	149713	149713	Mary	403	' was said at the other end of the room ; '
149742	149743	149744	149745	Little Amy	210	' '
149747	149752	149744	149745	Little Amy	210	' said Mr. Edmonstone . '
149771	149839	149764	149764	Amy	210	' Amy rose , and came forward , but the colour had flushed into her cheeks again , and the recollection occurred to Mary that her fame as a performer , in that way , arose from the very amusing manner in which she and Sir Guy had conducted the game last year . At the same moment , her mother met her , and whispered , — '
149848	149849	149764	149764	Amy	210	' '
149863	149864	149855	149855	mamma	5168	' '
149882	149883	149889	149890	dear mamma	6301	' '
149892	149899	149889	149890	dear mamma	6301	' with a look of relief . '
149908	149913	149902	149902	Charlotte	277	' said Mrs. Edmonstone . '
149936	150085	150086	150086	I	0	' Amy moved quietly away , and entered Charles 's room , full of warm gratitude for the kindness which was always seeking how to spare her . Charles was asleep , and throwing a shawl round her , she sat down in the dim light of the lamp , relieved by the stillness , only broken by now and then a louder note of the music down stairs . It was very comfortable after all that buzz of talk , and the jokes that seemed so nonsensical and tiresome . There were but two people who could manage to make a party entertaining , and that was the reason it was so different last year . Then Amy wondered if she was the only person who felt sick at heart and dreary ; but she only wondered for a moment — she murmured half aloud to herself , '
150184	150302	150179	150179	I	0	' She took up a book of sacred poetry , and began to learn a piece which she already nearly knew ; but the light was bad , and it was dreamy work ; and probably she was half asleep , for her thoughts wandered off to Sintram and the Mondenberg rocks , which seemed to her like what she had pictured the Redclyffe crags , and the castle itself was connected in her imagination with the deep , echoing porch , while Guy 's own voice seemed to be chanting — Who lives forlorn , On God 's own word doth rest ; His path is bright With heavenly light , His lot among the blest . '
150309	150315	150304	150304	you	0	' said Charles , waking . '
150323	150330	150304	150304	you	0	' Do n't they want you ? '
150331	150342	150179	150179	I	0	' Mamma was so kind as to send me up . '
150343	150379	150380	150380	Amy	210	' I am glad you are come , for I have something to tell you . Mr. Ross has been up to see me , you know , and he has a letter from Guy . '
150412	150423	150424	150424	he	156	' Mr. Ross is quite satisfied about him , Amy , '
150427	150442	150424	150424	he	156	' I wish you could have heard the decided way in which he said , '
150449	150474	150475	150475	Amy	210	' Amy 's answer was to stoop down and kiss her brother 's forehead . Another week brought Guy 's renewal of the correspondence . '
150485	150505	150475	150475	Amy	210	' said Charles , holding up the letter as she came into the room . She knew the writing . '
150513	150535	150510	150510	Charlie	156	' and she ran out of the room , found her mother fortunately alone , and said , averting her face , '
150553	150592	150547	150547	Charlie	156	' Mrs. Edmonstone took hold of her hand , and drew her round so as to look into the face through its veiling curls . The hand shook , and the face was in a glow of eagerness . '
150597	150911	150547	150547	Charlie	156	' said she , for she could not help it ; and then , as Amy ran back again , she asked herself whether it was foolish , and bad for her sweet little daughter ; then declared to herself that it must — it should — it would come right . There was not a word of Amy in the letter , but it , or something else , made her more bright and cheerful than she had been for some time past . It seemed as if the lengthening days of January were bringing renewed comfort with them , when Charles , who ever since October had been confined to bed , was able to wear the Chinese dressing - gown , be lifted to a couch , and wheeled into the dressing - room , still prostrate , but much enjoying the change of scene , which he called coming into the world . These were the events at quiet Hollywell , while Redclyffe was still engrossed with the shipwreck , which seemed to have come on purpose to enliven and occupy this solitary winter . It perplexed the Ashfords about their baronet more than ever . Mr. Ashford said that no one whose conscience was not clear could have confronted danger as he had done ; and yet , the certainty that he was under a cloud , and the sadness , so inconsistent with his age and temperament , still puzzled them . Mrs. Ashford thought , however , that she made a discovery . The second day after the wreck , the whole crew , except the little cabin - boy , were going to set off to the nearest sea - port ; and the evening preceding their departure , they were to meet their rescuers , the fishermen , at a supper in the great servants '
151003	151008	151001	151001	Strutt	424	' Sports and Pastimes , '
151145	151148	151139	151140	Jonas Ledbury	245	' Lady Morville '
151418	151447	151448	151448	Markham	157	' my lord had made particular inquiries how long he would be in the country , and had been to the cliff to see where the wreck was . '
151493	151528	151490	151490	he	150	' Oh , I hope all that is not coming on me yet ! Till I can manage Todd and Coombe Prior , I am sure I am not fit to manage the country ! '
151650	151721	151631	151631	Charles	156	' Dear G. , — I ought not to do this , but I must ; I have tyrannized over Charlotte , and obtained the wherewithal . Write me a full account of your gallant conduct . I saw it first in A. 's face . It has done you great good with my father . I will write more when I can . I ca n't get on now . '
151723	151760	151631	151631	Charles	156	' He might well say he had first seen it in his sister 's face . She had brought him the paper , and was looking for something he wanted her to read to him , when '
151763	151796	151797	151797	Amy	425	' met her eye , and then came the whole at one delightful glance . He saw the heightened colour , the exquisite smile , the tear - drop on the eyelash . '
151804	152022	152023	152024	Fine fellow	3074	' She pointed to the place , gave the paper into his hand , and burst into tears , the gush of triumphant feeling . Not one was shed because she was divided from the hero of the shipwreck ; they were pure unselfish tears of joy , exultation , and thankfulness . Charles read the history , and she listened in silence ; then looked it over again with him , and betrayed how thoroughly she had been taught the whole geography of Redclyffe Bay . The next person who came in was Charlotte ; and as soon as she understood what occupied them , she went into an ecstasy , and flew away with the paper , rushing with it straight into her father 's room , where she broke into the middle of his letter writing , by reading it in a voice of triumph . Mr. Edmonstone was delighted . He was just the person who would be far more taken with an exploit of this kind , such as would make a figure in the world , than by steady perseverance in well - doing , and his heart was won directly . His wrath at the hasty words had long been diminishing , and now was absolutely lost in his admiration . '
152029	152105	152026	152027	noble fellow	3075	' he said . He is the bravest boy I ever heard of ; but I knew what was in him from the first . I wish from my heart there was not this cloud over him . I am sure the whole story has not a word of truth in it , but he wo nt say a word to clear himself , or else we would have him here again to - morrow . '
152277	152317	152260	152260	he	156	' What a pen you 've given me , Charlotte . There goes a blot ! Here , another dip , will you ! and take up that with the blotting paper before it becomes more like a spider . '
152318	152327	152260	152260	he	156	' Wo nt you make a fresh beginning ? '
152328	152366	152374	152374	you	277	' No , that has cost me too much already . I 've got no more command over my fingers . Here we go into the further corner of the paper . Well ! C. M. E. There '
152391	152392	152393	152393	I	0	' '
152426	152427	152420	152420	you	277	' '

152451	152470	152472	152472	Charles	156	' I believe I did n't ought to have said it . Do n't tell her I did , '
152474	152523	152472	152472	Charles	156	' but I could n't for the life of me — or what is more to the purpose , for the trouble of it — help putting it . He is too true a knight not to hear that his lady , not exactly smiled , but cried . '
152524	152531	152533	152533	Charlotte	277	' He is a true knight , '
152551	152564	152472	152472	Charles	156	' Sir Guy Morville , Bart . , Redclyffe Park , Moorworth , '
152575	152602	152548	152548	she	277	' Do you remember , Charlie , how we sat here the first evening he came , and you took me in about the deadly feud ? '
152603	152611	152613	152613	Charles	156	' It was no take - in , '
152615	152625	152613	152613	Charles	156	' only the feud is all on one side . '
152626	152641	152643	152643	Charlotte	277	' Oh , dear ! it has been such a stupid winter without Guy , '
152645	152662	152643	152643	Charlotte	277	' if this wo nt make papa forgive him , I do n't know what will . '
152663	152674	152676	152676	Charles	156	' I wish it would , with all my heart , '
152678	152715	152676	152676	Charles	156	' but logically , if you understand the word , Charlotte , it does not make much difference to the accusation . It would not exactly be received as exculpatory evidence in a court of justice . '
152716	152725	152643	152643	Charlotte	277	' You do n't believe the horrid stories ? '
152726	152803	152643	152643	Charlotte	277	' I believe that Guy has gamed quite as much as I have myself ; but I want to see him cleared beyond the power of Philip to gainsay or disbelieve it . I should like to have such a force of proof as would annihilate Philip ; and if I was anything but what I am , I would have it . If you could but lend me a leg for two days , Charlotte . '
152804	152810	152643	152643	Charlotte	277	' I wish I could . '
152811	152818	152820	152820	Charles	156	' One thing shall be done , '
152822	152855	152820	152820	Charles	156	' my father shall go and meet him in person when he comes of age . Now Don Philip is out of the way , I trust I can bring that about . '
152856	152864	152643	152643	Charlotte	277	' If he would but come here ! '
152865	152965	152643	152643	Charlotte	277	' No , that must not be , as mamma says , till there is some explanation ; but if I was but in my usual state , I would go with papa , and meet him in London . I wonder if there is any chance of it . The 28th of March — ten weeks off ! If I can but get hold of those trusty crutches of mine by that time , I 'll do , and I 'll do , and I 'll do . We would bring back Amy 's knight with flying colours . '
152966	152975	152820	152820	Charles	156	' Oh , how happy we should be ! '
152976	153025	152643	152643	Charlotte	277	' If I only knew what sort of sense that Markham of his may have , I would give him a hint , and set him to ferret out at St. Mildred 's . Or shall I get Dr. Mayerne to order me there for change of air ? '
153278	153282	153284	153284	he	150	' Sir Guy , '
153286	153324	153284	153284	he	150	' is it that which is wrong with you ? Do n't be angry with an old man for asking the question , but I only would hope and trust you are not getting into any scrape . '
153325	153331	153333	153333	Guy	150	' Thank you , Markham , '
153339	153370	153333	153333	Guy	150	' I can not tell you about it . I will only set you at rest by saying it is nothing you could think I ought to be ashamed of . '
153371	153390	153392	153392	Markham	157	' Then why — what has come between ? What could man or woman object to in you ? '
153398	153403	153405	153405	Guy	150	' These unhappy suspicions , '
153407	153415	153417	153417	Markham	157	' I ca n't make it out , '
153419	153433	153434	153434	Guy	150	' You must have been doing something foolish to give rise to them . '
153548	153574	153533	153533	He	156	' You know no one has seen him yet but Philip , and he would tell things to you that he might not to him . '
153584	153609	153533	153533	He	156	' Of course I have more weight and experience , and — and poor Guy is very fond of us . Eh , Charlie ? '

153676	153698	153700	153700	he	150	' vain as are my attempts to keep my poor uncle from sinking himself further ! Is it fair , thought , '
153705	153800	153700	153700	he	150	' that the happiness of at least one life should be sacrificed to hide one step in the ruin of a man who will not let himself be saved ? Is it not a waste of self - devotion ? Have I any right to sacrifice hers ? Ought I not rather — and a flash of joy came over him—'to make my uncle give me back my promise of concealment ? I can make it up to him . It can not injure him , since only the Edmonstones will know it ! But '
153932	153988	153989	153989	I	0	' Guy quitted these thoughts to write to Markham to make the appointment , finishing his letter with a request that Markham would stop at St. Mildred 's on his way to London , and pay Miss Wellwood , the lady with whom his uncle 's daughter was placed , for her quarter 's board .

154032	154248	154008	154008	you	3096	' The time before the day of meeting was spent in strengthening himself against the pain it would be to refuse his confidence to Mr. Edmonstone , and thus to throw away the last chance of reconciliation , and of Amy . This would be the bitterest pang of all — to see them ready to receive him , and be forced to reject their kindness . So passed the preceding week , and with it his twenty - first birthday , spent very differently from the way in which it would ordinarily be passed by a youth in his position . It went by in hard study and sad musings , in bracing himself to a resolution that would cost him all he held dear , and , as the only means of so bracing himself , in trying to fix his gaze more steadily beyond the earth . Easter day steadied the gaze once more for him , and as the past week had nerved him in the spirit of self - sacrifice , the feast day brought him true unchanging joy , shining out of sadness , and enlightening the path that would lead him to keep his resolution to the utmost , and endure the want of earthly hope . Southey . '
154253	154273	154008	154008	you	3096	' thought Guy , as he dismissed his cab , and was shown up - stairs in the hotel . '
154281	154323	154008	154008	you	3096	' The door was opened , and he beheld Mr. Edmonstone , Markham , and another — it surely was Sebastian Dixon ! All sprung up to receive him ; and Mr. Edmonstone , seizing him by both hands , exclaimed — '
154404	154444	154445	154445	he	0	' Guy was almost giddy with surprise . He held one of Mr. Edmonstone 's hands , and pressed it hard ; his other hand he passed over his eyes , as if in a dream . All right ? '
154448	154452	154454	154455	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' All right ! '
154457	154506	154454	154455	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' I know where your money went , and I honour you for it ; and there stands the man who told me the whole story . I said , from the first , it was a confounded slander . It was all owing to the little girl . '
154524	154555	154507	154507	Guy	150	' Never till this morning had I the least suspicion that I had been the means of bringing you under any imputation . How could you keep me in ignorance ? '
154556	154561	154454	154455	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' You have told — '
154562	154567	154570	154571	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Of the cheque , '
154573	154618	154570	154571	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' and of all the rest , and of your providing for the little girl . How could you do it , with that pittance of an allowance of yours ? And master Philip saying you never had any money ! No wonder indeed ! '
154619	154629	154631	154631	Dixon	338	' If I had known you were pinching yourself , '
154633	154640	154631	154631	Dixon	338	' my mind would have revolted — '
154641	154647	154649	154649	Guy	150	' Let me understand it , '
154658	154682	154649	154649	Guy	150	' Tell me , Markham . Is it really so ? Am I cleared ? Has Mr. Edmonstone a right to be satisfied ? '
154683	154689	154691	154691	Markham	157	' Yes , Sir Guy , '
154696	154719	154720	154720	Guy	150	' Mr. Dixon has accounted for your disposal of the thirty pound cheque , and there is an end of the matter . '
154735	154743	154745	154745	he	150	' I can not thank you enough ! '
154755	154760	154752	154753	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' how is Charles ? '
154761	154779	154720	154720	Guy	150	' Better — much better ; you shall see him to - morrow — eh , Guy ? '
154780	154792	154752	154753	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' But I can not explain about the one thousand pounds . '
154793	154817	154752	154753	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Never mind — you never had it , so you ca n't have misspent it . That 's neither here nor there . '
154818	154827	154720	154720	Guy	150	' And you forgive my language respecting you ? '
154828	154875	154752	154753	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Nonsense about that ! If you never said anything worse than that Philip was a meddling coxcomb , you have n't much to repent of ; and I am sure I was ten old fools when I let him bore me into writing that letter . '
154876	154909	154752	154753	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' No , no , you did right , under your belief ; and circumstances were strong against me . And is it clear ? — are we where we were before ? '
154910	154955	154720	154720	Guy	150	' We are — we are in everything ; only we know better what you are worth , Guy . Shake hands once more . There 's an end of all misunderstanding and vexation , and we shall be all right at home again ! '
154977	154998	155000	155000	he	150	' It is too much . I do n't understand it . How did you know this matter wanted explanation ? '
155007	155035	155000	155000	he	150	' I learnt it from Mr. Markham , and you will do me the justice to believe that I was greatly shocked to find that your generosity — '
155036	155045	155047	155047	Markham	157	' The truth of the matter is this , '
155049	155148	155047	155047	Markham	157	' You sent me to Miss Wellwood 's , at St. Mildred 's . The principal was not within , and while waiting for her to make the payment , I got into conversation with her sister , Miss Jane . She told me that the child , Mr. Dixon 's daughter , was always talking of your kindness , especially of a morning at St. Mildred 's , when you helped him in some difficulty . I thought this threw some light on the matter , found out Mr. Dixon this morning and you see the result . '
155149	155154	155156	155156	Guy	150	' I do indeed , '
155158	155169	155156	155156	Guy	150	' I wish I could attempt to thank you all . '
155170	155182	155184	155184	Markham	157	' Thanks enough for me to see you look like yourself , '
155186	155217	155184	155184	Markham	157	' Did you think I was going to sit still , and leave you in the mess you had got yourself into , with your irregularity about keeping your accounts ? '
155218	155223	155225	155225	Guy	150	' And to you , '
155244	155255	155225	155225	Guy	150	' You never can guess what I owe to you ! '
155256	155266	155268	155268	Sebastian	338	' Nay , I deserve no thanks at all , '
155270	155341	155268	155268	Sebastian	338	' since I was the means of bringing the imputation on you ; and I am sure it is enough for a wretch like me not to have brought only misery wherever I turn — to have done something to repair the evil I have caused . Oh , could I but bring back your father to what he was when first I saw him , as you are now ! '
155385	155461	155375	155376	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Come , what 's past ca n't be helped , and I have no end of work to be done , so there 's speechifying enough for once . Mr. Dixon , you must not be going . Sit down and look over the newspaper , while we sign these papers . You must dine with us , and drink your nephew 's health , though it is not his real birth - day . '
155597	155602	155587	155588	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' eh , Guy ! '
155747	155794	155808	155808	he	156	' So , here you are again . I was afraid he was carrying you off to his concert after all . I believe you have half a mind for it . Do you like to stay in London for the next ? Eh , Guy ? '
155848	155851	155853	155854	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Well , '
155856	155895	155853	155854	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' the man is more gentlemanlike than I expected . A good sort of fellow at the bottom , I dare say . He was pretty considerably shocked to find he had brought you into such a scrape . '
155896	155902	155904	155904	Guy	150	' He is very generous , '
155906	155919	155904	155904	Guy	150	' Oh , there is much of a noble character in him . '
155920	155925	155853	155854	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Noble ? humph ! '
155930	155968	155853	155854	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' He has gone down - hill fast enough , since I used to see him in your father 's time ; but I am glad he had the decency not to be the undoing of you . '
155969	155977	155979	155979	Guy	150	' His feeling is his great point , '
155981	155995	155979	155979	Guy	150	' when you can once get at it . I wish — But , '
156000	156021	155979	155979	Guy	150	' I ca n't make it out . What did little Marianne tell you ? Or was it Miss Wellwood ? '
156022	156030	156032	156032	Markham	157	' It was first the youngest sister , '
156034	156116	156032	156032	Markham	157	' I sat there talking to her some little time ; she said you had been very kind to the family , and the child was very grateful to you — was always talking of some morning when you and your dog came , and helped her mother . Her father had been out all night , and her mother was crying , she said , and declaring he would be sent to prison , till you came and helped them . '
156117	156124	156126	156126	Guy	150	' Yes , that 's it , '
156128	156390	156126	156126	Guy	150	' Well , I remembered what you had told me of the mystery of the draft , and guessed that this might be the clue to it . I begged to see the child , and in she came , the very image of your mother , and a sharp little thing that knew what she meant , but had not much idea of the shame , poor child , about her father . She told me the story of his coming home in the morning , and her mother being in great distress , and saying they were ruined , till you came and talked to her mother , and gave her something . I asked if it was money , and she said it was paper . I showed her a draft , and she knew it was like that . So then I made her tell me where to find her father , whom I used to know in old times , and had to write to , now and then . I hunted him up , and a creditable figure he was , to be sure ; but I got the truth out of him at last , and when he heard you had got into disgrace on his account , he raved like a tragedy hero , and swore he would come and tell your guardian the whole story . I put him into a cab for fear he should repent , and he had just got to the end of it when you came in . '
156391	156404	156032	156032	Markham	157	' It is of no use to thank you again , Markham ! '
156405	156423	156425	156425	Markham	157	' Why , I have been getting your family out of scrapes these forty years or thereabouts , '
156427	156431	156032	156032	Markham	157	'' tis all I 'm
156468	156710	156126	156126	Guy	150	' To the accounts they went at once . There was a good deal to be settled ; and though Guy had as yet no legal power , according to his grandfather 's will , he was of course consulted about everything . He was glad that , since he could not be alone to bring himself to the realization of his newly recovered happiness , he should have this sobering and engrossing occupation . There he sat , coolly discussing leases and repairs , and only now and then allowing himself a sort of glimpse at the treasury of joy awaiting him whenever he had time to dwell on it . The Coombe Prior matters were set in a better train , the preliminary arrangements about the curacy were made , and Guy had hopes it would be his friend Mr. Wellwood 's title for Orders . There was no time to write to Hollywell , or rather Mr. Edmonstone forgot to do so till it was too late , and then consoled himself by observing that it did not signify if his family were taken by surprise , since joy killed no one . His family were by no means of opinion that it did not signify when the next morning 's post brought them no letter . Mrs. Edmonstone and Charles had hoped much , and Amy did not know how much she had hoped till the melancholy words '
156713	156843	156845	156845	I	0	' passed from one to the other . To make it worse , by some of those mismanagements of Mr. Edmonstone 's which used to run counter to his wife 's arrangements , a dinner - party had been fixed for this identical Wednesday , and the prospect was agreeable to no one , especially when the four o'clock train did not bring Mr. Edmonstone , who , therefore , was not to be expected till seven , when all the world would be arrived . Laura helped Amy to dress , put the flowers in her hair , kissed her , and told her it was a trying day ; and Amy sighed wearily , thanked her , and went down with arms twined in hers , whispering , '
156860	157032	157147	157147	she	3119	' Laura thought the case so hopeless , that she was sorry Amy could not cease from the foolishness , and did not answer . Amy sat down at the foot of the sofa , whither Charles was now carried down every day , and , without venturing to look at him , worked at her netting . A carriage — her colour came and went , but it was only some of the guests ; another — the Brownlows . Amy was speaking to Miss Brownlow when she heard more greetings ; she looked up , caught by the arm of the sofa , and looked again . Her father was pouring out apologies and welcomes , and her mother was shaking hands with Guy . Was it a dream ? She shut her eyes , then looked again . He was close to her by this time , she felt his fingers close on her white glove for one moment , but she only heard his voice in the earnest '
157039	157094	157035	157035	you	3119	' Her father came to her , gave her first his usual kiss of greeting , then , not letting her go , looked at her for a moment , and , as if he could not help it , kissed her on both cheeks , and said,—'How d'ye do , my little Amy ? '
157136	157145	157170	157170	she	3119	' Sir Guy 's bag to his room , '
157193	157209	157170	157170	she	3119	' Amy , my dear , you look wild . What has come to you ? '
157210	157218	157170	157170	she	3119	' Papa is come home , and — '
157235	157238	157240	157240	Mary	208	' And ? '
157242	157249	157240	157240	Mary	208	' and the mystery is explained ? '
157250	157280	157170	157170	she	3119	' Oh ! I do n't know , they are only just come , and I was so silly , I ran away,—I did not know what to do . '
157281	157289	157291	157291	Mary	208	' They are come , are they ? '
157293	157303	157304	157304	She	208	' My little Amy , I see it all . '
157408	157410	157420	157420	she	159	' Mamma '
157625	157634	157636	157636	she	159	' If you had come two hours ago , '
157641	157672	157636	157636	she	159	' I would have let you be at home . Now you must be a great man , and be content with me . It will be better for Amy . '
157826	157843	157808	157808	Laura	454	' Do n't ask me any questions , for I know nothing at all about it . '
157996	158015	157992	157992	Laura	454	' This — try this — your part is almost nothing ; or ca n't you do this ? '
158112	158131	158107	158107	he	207	' I beg your pardon for making such bad work . I am so much out of practice . '
158187	158196	158178	158178	she	425	' Do n't you dislike all this excessively ? '
158197	158209	158178	158178	she	425	' It does as well as anything else , thank you , '
158214	158223	158178	158178	she	425	' I can do it better than talking . '
158246	158258	158237	158237	Mary	208	' How glad you must be to get rid of us ! '
158279	158384	158269	158269	she	159	' Little Amy , as soon as she had heard the last carriage roll off , wished every one good night , shook hands with Guy , holding up the lighted candle between him and her face as a veil , and ran away to her own room . The others remained in a sort of embarrassed silence , Mr. Edmonstone rubbing his hands ; Laura lighted the candles , Charlotte asked after Bustle , and was answered that he was at Oxford , and Charles , laying hold of the side of the sofa , pulled himself by it into a sitting posture . '
158390	158394	158396	158396	you	0	' said Guy . '
158448	158449	158439	158439	I	0	' '
158480	158524	158478	158478	Guy	150	' said Mr. Edmonstone . Guy and Mrs. Edmonstone had not hitherto trusted themselves to speak to each other , but they looked and smiled , then , wishing the rest good night , they disappeared . Then there was a simultaneous outbreak of '
158527	158528	158478	158478	Guy	150	' '
158532	158537	158543	158543	He	3147	' said Mr. Edmonstone . '
158575	158576	158562	158564	an old fool	3150	' '
158579	158591	158562	158564	an old fool	3150	' cried Charles , drumming on the back of his sofa . '
158606	158607	158610	158611	that Dixon	338	' '
158643	158644	158615	158615	he	338	' '
158649	158653	158615	158615	he	338	' cried Charles . '
158694	158695	158688	158688	Philip	454	' '
158702	158706	158696	158696	I	0	' cried Charles . '
158752	158761	158762	158762	I	0	' as she was wildly curvetting round him . '
158767	158797	158762	158762	I	0	' said Mr. Edmonstone . ; I knew it was not in him to go wrong . It was only Philip , who would persuade me black was white . '
158798	158807	158809	158809	Charles	156	' I never believed one word of it , '
158811	158821	158809	158809	Charles	156	' still less after I saw Philip 's animosity . '
158822	158829	158831	158831	Laura	454	' Les absens ont toujours tort , '
158851	158852	158841	158841	she	3160	' '
158863	158867	158854	158854	I	0	' cried Charlotte . '
158876	159259	159260	159260	He	3161	' She rushed up stairs , afraid of being forestalled . Laura lingered , putting some books away in the ante - room , trying to overcome the weary pain at her heart . She did not know how to be confident . Her father 's judgment was worthless in her eyes , and Philip had predicted that Amy would be sacrificed after all . To see them happy made her sigh at the distance of her own hopes , and worse than all was self - reproach for unkindness in not rejoicing with the rest , in spite of her real affection for Guy himself . When she thought of him , she could not believe him guilty ; when she thought of Philip 's belief , she could not suppose him innocent , and she pitied her sister for enjoying a delusive happiness . With effort , however , she went to her room , and , finding her a little overpowered by Charlotte 's tumultuous joy , saw that peace and solitude were best for her till she could have more certain intelligence , and , after very tender good - nights , carried off Charlotte . It would be hard to describe Mrs. Edmonstone 's emotions as she preceded Guy to the dressing - room , and sat down , looking up to him as he stood in his old place by the fire . She thought he did not look well , though it might be only that the sun - burnt colour had given place to his natural fairness ; his eyes , though bright as ever , did not dance and sparkle ; a graver expression sat on his brow ; and although he still looked very young , a change there certainly was , which made him man instead of boy — a look of having suffered , and conquered suffering . She felt even more motherly affection for him now than when he last stood there in the full tide of his first outburst of his love for her daughter , and her heart was almost too full for speech ; but he seemed to be waiting for her , and at last she said,—'I am very glad to have you here again . '
159268	159277	159260	159260	He	3161	' May I tell you all about it ? '
159278	159302	159412	159413	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Sit down here . I want very much to hear it . I am sure you have gone through a great deal . '
159303	159309	159311	159311	he	3161	' I have , indeed , '
159346	159354	159356	159356	she	3162	' But it is at an end , '
159358	159375	159356	159356	she	3162	' I have scarcely seen Mr. Edmonstone , but he tells me he is perfectly satisfied . '
159376	159403	159412	159413	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' He is so kind as to be satisfied , though you know I still can not explain about the large sum I asked him for . '
159404	159410	159412	159413	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' We will trust you , '
159417	159432	159412	159413	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' but I am very anxious to hear how you came to an understanding . '
159468	159476	159478	159478	she	3162	' You had rather to forgive us ! '
159480	159488	159490	159490	Guy	150	' You forget how ill I behaved , '
159494	159529	159490	159490	Guy	150	' If you knew the madness of those first moments of provocation , you would think that the penance of a lifetime , instead of only one winter , would scarce have been sufficient . '
159530	159547	159445	159445	she	3162	' You would not say , as Charles does , that the suspicion justified your anger ? '
159548	159553	159554	159554	He	150	' No , indeed ! '
159560	159587	159554	159554	He	150	' Thank Heaven , it did not last long ; but the insight it gave me into the unsubdued evil about me was a fearful thing . '
159588	159634	159445	159445	she	3162	' But you conquered it . They were the unguarded exclamations of the first shock . Your whole conduct since , especially the interview with Philip , has shown that your anger has not been abiding , and that you have learnt to subdue it . '
159635	159686	159688	159688	Guy	150	' It could not abide , for there was no just cause of offence . Of course such a dreadful outburst warned me to be on my guard ; and you know the very sight of Philip is a warning that there is danger in that way ! I mean , '
159699	159727	159688	159688	Guy	150	' I mean that I know of old that I am apt to be worried by his manner , and that ought to make me doubly cautious . '
159790	159804	159805	159805	he	150	' I am very glad to be able to explain all to Philip , '
159808	159890	159891	159891	he	150	' I will write as soon as possible . Oh , Mrs. Edmonstone ! if you knew what it is to be brought back to such unhoped - for happiness , to sit here once more , with you,'—his voice trembled , and the tears were in her eyes,—'to have seen her , to have all overlooked , and return to all I hoped last year . I want to look at you all , to believe that it is true , '
159896	159905	159907	159907	she	3164	' You both behaved very well this evening , '

160010	160056	160001	160001	she	3164	' I told you last summer what I thought of it , and you must settle the rest with Amy to - morrow . I hear the drawing - room bell , which is a sign I must send you to bed . Good night ! '
160057	160061	160063	160063	Guy	150	' Good night ! '
160071	160093	160063	160063	Guy	150	' It is so long since I have had any one to wish me good night ! Good night , mamma ! '
160184	160196	160176	160176	She	210	' Oh , mamma ! how kind of you to come ! '
160197	160272	160273	160273	Amy	210	' I can only stay a moment , my dear ; your papa is coming up ; but I must just tell you that I have been having such a nice talk with dear Guy . He has behaved beautifully , and papa is quite satisfied . Now , darling , I hope you will not lie awake all night , or you wo n't be fit to talk to him to - morrow . '
160289	160296	160297	160297	she	210	' Then he is happy again , '

161097	161122	161086	161086	he	150	' Amabel , I want you to consider — you really ought to think whether this is not a very bad thing for you . '
161154	161296	161151	161151	He	150	' I have brought you nothing but unhappiness already . So far as you have taken any interest in me , it could cause you only pain , and the more I think of it , the more unfit it seems that one so formed for light and joy , and innocent mirth should have anything to do with the darkness that is round me . Think well of it . I feel as if I had done a selfish thing by you , and now , you know , you are not bound . You are quite free ! No one knows anything about it ; or if they did , the blame would rest entirely with me . I would take care it should . So Amy , think , and think well , before you risk your happiness . '
161297	161302	161304	161304	Amy	210	' As to that , '

163055	163208	163042	163042	she	208	' Mary had seen enough last night to be very curious to - day , though hardly expecting her curiosity to be gratified . However , as she was putting on her bonnet for church , she looked out of her window , and saw the four coming across the fields from Holywell . Guy and Amy did not walk into the village arm - in - arm ; but , as they came under the church porch , Guy , unseen by all , held out his hand , sought hers , and , for one moment , pressed it fervently . Amy knew he felt this like their betrothal . After the service , they stood talking with Mr. Ross and Mary , for some little time . Amy held apart , and Mary saw how it was . As they were about to turn homewards , Amy said quickly , '
163219	163240	163241	163241	Mary	208	' She went on with Mary before the rest ; and when out of sight of them all , said , '
163243	163249	163241	163241	Mary	208	' and then stopped short . '

She wondered , however , whether it was not a more truly happy and safe frame than that of most girls , looking forward to a life of unclouded happiness , such as could never be realized . At least , so it struck Mary , though she owned to herself that her experience of lovers was limited . Mary walked with Amy almost to the borders of Hollywell - garden ; and when the rest came up with them , though no word passed , there was a great deal of congratulation in her warm shake of Guy 's hand , and no lack of reply in his proud smile and reddening cheek . Charlotte could not help turning and going back with her a little way , to say , '

163843	164383	163832	163832	he	150	' Mary laughed , and parted with Charlotte , speculating on the cause of Laura 's graver looks . Were they caused by the fear of losing her sister , or by a want of confidence in Guy ? That evening , how happy was the party at Hollywell , when Charles put Guy through a cross - examination on the shipwreck , from the first puff of wind to the last drop of rain ; and Guy submitted very patiently , since he was allowed the solace of praising his Redclyffe fishermen . Indeed , this time was full of tranquil , serene happiness . It was like the lovely weather only to be met with in the spring , and then but rarely , when the sky is cloudless , and intensely blue,—the sunshine one glow of clearness without burning,—not a breath of wind checks the silent growth of the expanding buds of light exquisite green . Such days as these shone on Guy and Amabel , looking little to the future , or if they did so at all , with a grave , peaceful awe , reposing in the present , and resuming old habits,—singing , reading , gardening , walking as of old , and that intercourse with each other that was so much more than ever before . It was more , but it was not quite the same ; for Guy was a very chivalrous lover ; the polish and courtesy that sat so well on his frank , truthful manners were even more remarkable in his courtship . His ways with Amy had less of easy familiarity than in the time of their brother - and - sister - like intimacy , so that a stranger might have imagined her wooed , not won . It was as if he hardly dared to believe that she could really be his own , and treated her with a sort of reverential love and gentleness , while she looked up to him with ever - increasing honour . She was better able to understand him now than in her more childish days last summer ; and she did not merely see , as before , that she was looking at the upper surface of a mystery . He had , at the same time , grown in character ; his excitability and over - sensitiveness seemed to have been smoothed away , and to have given place to a calmness of tone , that was by no means impassibility . When alone with Amy , he was generally very grave , often silent and meditative , or else their talk was deep and serious ; and even with the family , he was less merry and more thoughtful than of old , though very bright and animated , and showing full , free affection to them all , as entirely accepted and owned as one of them . So , indeed , he was . Mr. Edmonstone , with his intense delight in lovers , patronized them , and made common - place jokes , which they soon learnt to bear without much discomposure . Mrs. Edmonstone was all that her constant appellation of '
164385	164701	164856	164857	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' betokened , delighting in Guy 's having learnt to call her so . Charles enjoyed the restoration of his friend , the sight of Amy 's happiness , and the victory over Philip , and was growing better every day . Charlotte was supremely happy , watching the first love affair ever conducted in her sight , and little less so in the return of Bustle , who resumed his old habits as regularly as if he had only left Hollywell yesterday . Laura alone was unhappy . She did not understand her own feelings ; but sad at heart she was , with only one who could sympathize with her , and he far away , and the current of feeling setting against him . She could not conceal her depression , and was obliged to allow it to be attributed to the grief that one sister must feel in parting with another ; and as her compassion for her little Amy , coupled with her dread of her latent jealousy , made her particularly tender and affectionate , it gave even more probability to the supposition . This made Guy , who felt as if he was committing a robbery on them all , particularly kind to her , as if he wished to atone for the injury of taking away her sister ; and his kindness gave her additional pain at entertaining such hard thoughts of him . How false she felt when she was pitied ! and how she hated the congratulations , of which she had the full share ! She thought , however , that she should be able to rejoice when she had heard Philip 's opinion ; and how delightful it would be for him to declare himself satisfied with Guy 's exculpation . Tennyson . If ever there was a meddlesome coxcomb on this earth ! '
164747	164846	164729	164730	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Guy began ; his lips were tightly pressed together ; his brows made one black line across his forehead , and his eye sparkled , even through his bent down eyelashes ; but this lasted only a few moments ; the forehead smoothed again , and there was a kind of deliberate restraint and force upon himself , which had so much power that no one spoke till he had finished , folded it up with a sort of extra care , and returned it , only saying,—'You should not show one such letters , Mr. Edmonstone . '
164847	164854	164856	164857	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Does not it beat everything ? '
164859	164936	164856	164857	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' If that is not impertinence , I should like to know what is ! But he has played my Lord Paramount rather too long , as I can tell him ! I ask his consent , forsooth ! Probation , indeed ! You might marry her to - morrow , and welcome . There , give it to mamma . See if she does not say the same . Mere spite and malice all along . '

166409	166434	166473	166474	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' I was too happy to think about the future ; besides , I did not know whether you had sufficient confidence in me . '
166435	166458	166459	166459	Guy	150	' Confidence , nonsense ! I tell you , if I had a dozen daughters I would trust them all to you . '
166479	166600	166473	166474	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' I have the most absolute confidence in you ! I am going to write to Philip this minute , to tell him he has played three - tailed Bashaw rather too long . I shall tell him it is to be very soon , at any rate , and that if he wishes to see how I value his pragmatical advice , he may come and dance at the wedding . I declare , your mamma and that colonel of his have perfectly spoilt him with their flattery ! I knew what would come of it ; you all would make a prodigy of him , till he 's so puffed up that he entirely forgets who he is ! '
166601	166605	166607	166607	Charles	156	' Not I , '
166609	166619	166607	166607	Charles	156	' that ca n't be laid to my door . '
166620	166654	166473	166474	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' But I 'll write him such a letter this instant as shall make him remember what he is , and show him who he has to deal with . Eh , Charlie ? '
166655	166661	166663	166663	Guy	150	' Do n't you think , '
166669	166695	166663	166663	Guy	150	' that it might be better to wait a day or two , till we see our way clearer , and are a little cooler ? '
166696	166766	166473	166474	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' I tell you , Guy , there is no one that puts me out of patience now , but yourself . You are as bad as Philip himself . Cool ? I am coolness itself , all but what 's proper spirit for a man to show when his family is affronted and himself dictated to by a meddling young Jackanapes . I 'll serve him out properly ! '
166780	166784	166786	166786	Charles	156	' Never mind , '
166788	166816	166786	166786	Charles	156	' I 'll take care the letter is moderate . Besides , it is only Philip , and he knows that letter writing is not his forte . '
166817	166843	166473	166474	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' I am afraid things will be said in irritation , which you will both regret . There are justice and reason in the letter . '
166844	166858	166663	166663	Guy	150	' There shall be more in the answer , as you will see . '
166859	166891	166786	166786	Charles	156	' No , I will not see . It is Mr. Edmonstone 's concern , not mine . I am the last person who should have anything to do with it . '
166892	166904	166473	166474	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Just what the individual in question would not have said . '
166905	166917	166663	166663	Guy	150	' Would you do one thing to oblige me , Charlie ? '
166918	166933	166786	166786	Charles	156	' Anything but not speaking my mind to , or of , the captain . '
166934	166967	166473	166474	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' That is the very thing , unluckily . Try to get the answer put off till to - morrow , and that will give time to look at this letter candidly . '
166968	167023	166663	166663	Guy	150	' All the candour in the world will not make me think otherwise than that he is disappointed at being no longer able to make us the puppets of his malevolence . Do n't answer , or if you do , tell me what you say in favour of that delicate insinuation of his . '
167038	167047	167048	167048	he	150	'' Tis not fair to ask such questions , '
167055	167080	167048	167048	he	150	' It is throwing oil on the fire . I was trying to forget it . He neither knows my uncle nor the circumstances . '
167081	167352	167024	167024	Guy	150	' Well , I am glad there is a point on which you ca n't even pretend to stand up for him , or I should have thought you crazed with Quixotism . But I am keeping you when you want to be off to Amy . Never mind Mr. Ready - to - halt ; I shall wait till my father comes back . If you want the letter put off , you had better give some hopes of — Oh , he is gone ; and disinterested advice it is of mine , for what is to become of me without Amy remains to be proved . Laura , poor thing , looks like Patience on a monument . I wonder whether Philip 's disgrace has anything to do with it . Hum ? If mamma 's old idea was right , the captain has been more like moth and candle than consistent with his prudence , unless he thought it à toute épreuve . I wonder what came to pass last autumn , when I was ill , and mamma 's head full of me . He may not intend it , and she may not know it , but I would by no means answer for Cupid 's being guiltless of that harassed look she has had ever since that ball - going summer . Oh ! there go that pretty study , Amy and her true knight . As to Guy , he is more incomprehensible than ever ; yet there is no avoiding obeying him , on the principle on which that child in the '
167355	167363	167048	167048	he	150	' said she should obey Don Quixote . '
167504	167615	167616	167616	I	0	' Mrs. Edmonstone sighed ; but when he was gone , she agreed with Charles that there was nothing to wait for , and that it would be better for Guy to take his wife at once with him , when he settled at Redclyffe . So it must be whenever Amy could make up her mind to it ; and thereupon they made plans for future meetings , Charles announcing that the Prince of the Black Isles would become locomotive , and Charlotte forming grand designs upon Shag Island . In the meantime , Guy and Amy were walking in the path through the wood , where he began : '

170235	170247	170223	170223	he	3293	' said Amy , as if she wished to be convinced ; '
170323	170464	170465	170465	I	0	' Poor Laura , she knew not whether gratitude to Guy was not one of her most painful sensations . She wished much to know what had been said in the letter ; but only one sentence transpired , and that was , that Mr. Edmonstone had never heard it was necessary to apply to a nephew for consent to a daughter 's marriage . it seemed as if it must have been as cutting as Charles could make it ; but Laura trusted to Philip 's knowledge of the family , and desire for their good , to make him forgive it ; and the expectation of seeing him again at the wedding , cheered her . Indeed , a hope of still greater consequences began to rise in her mind , after Charles one day said to her , '
170483	170513	170479	170479	he	0	' I say , Charlie , I wish you would take care Amy 's fortune is not settled on her so that it ca n't be got rid of . '

170565	170576	170528	170528	he	0	' said Laura , more earnestly than Charles had expected . '
170586	170587	170584	170584	Charlie	156	' '
170609	170888	170606	170606	I	0	' Charles watched Laura , and the former idea recurred , as he wondered whether there was any particular meaning in her inquiry . Meaning , indeed , there was . Laura knew nothing about the value of money ; she did not know what Philip had of his own ; how far five , or even ten , thousand would go in enabling them to marry , or whether it was available in her father 's life - time ; but she thought this prospect might smooth the way to the avowal of their attachment , as effectually as his promotion ; she reckoned on relief from the weary oppression of secrecy , and fully expected that it would all be told in the favourable juncture , when her parents were full of satisfaction in Amy 's marriage . Gratitude to Guy would put an end to all doubt , dislike , and prejudice , and Philip would receive him as a brother . These hopes supported Laura , and enabled her to take part with more appearance of interest in the consultations and arrangements for the marriage , which were carried on speedily , as the time was short , and Mr. Edmonstone 's ideas were on a grand scale . It seemed as if he meant to invite all the world , and there were no limits to his views of breakfast , carriages , and splendours . His wife let him run out without contradiction , leaving the plans either to evaporate or condense , as time might prove best . Guy took Amy out walking , and asked what she thought of it . '

171127	171172	171123	171123	Amy	425	' However , what I mean is , that I do n't care about it , if I am not obliged to attend , and give my mind , to those kind of things just then , and that mamma will take care of . '
171173	171206	171097	171097	Amy	425	' Is it not a great trouble for her ? I forgot that . It was selfish : for we slip out of the fuss , and it all falls on her . '
171207	171210	171212	171212	Amy	425	' Yes , '
171214	171261	171263	171263	she	425	' but do n't you think it would teaze her more to have to persuade papa out of what he likes , and alter every little matter . That would be worry , the rest only exertion ; and , do you know , I think , '
171270	171288	171263	171263	she	425	' that it will be better for her , to keep her from thinking about losing me . '
171289	171324	171097	171097	Amy	425	' I see . Very well , we will take the finery quietly . Only one thing . Amy , we will not be put out of,—we will not miss the full holyday service . '
171325	171336	171097	171097	Amy	425	' Oh , yes ; that will be the comfort . '
171337	171413	171263	171263	she	425	' One other thing , Amy . You know I have hardly a friend of my own ; but there is one person I should like to ask,—Markham . He has been so kind , and so much attached to me ; he loved my father so devotedly , and suffered so much at his death , that it is a pity he should not be made happy ; and very happy he will be . '
171414	171466	171097	171097	Amy	425	' And there is one person I should like to ask , Guy , if mamma thinks we can do it . I am sure little Marianne ought to be one of my bridesmaids . Charlotte would take care of her , and it would be very nice to have her . '
171521	171524	171492	171494	Maurice de Courcy	181	' Morville ; '
171753	172341	172343	172343	Maurice	181	' probation , he saw the only hope of steadying Guy , or of saving Amy ; and he was much concerned at the rejection of his advice , entirely for their sakes , for he could not condescend to be affronted at the scornful , satirical tone towards himself , in which Charles 's little spitefulness was so fully apparent . The wedding was a regular sacrifice , and Amabel was nothing but a victim ; but an invitation to Hollywell had a charm for him that he scarcely could resist . To see Laura again , after having parted , as he thought , for so many years , delighted him in anticipation ; and it would manifest his real interest in his young cousins , and show that he was superior to taking offence at the folly of Charles or his father . These were his first thoughts and inclinations ; his second were , that it was contrary to his principles to sanction so foolish and hasty a marriage by his presence , that he should thus be affording a triumph to Guy , and to one who would use it less moderately — to Charles . It would be more worthy of himself , more consistent with his whole course of conduct , to refuse his presence , instead of going amongst them when they were all infatuated , and unable to listen to sober counsel . If he stayed away now , when Guy should have justified his opinion , they would all own how wisely he had acted , and would see the true dignity which had refused , unlike common minds , to let his complaisance draw him into giving any sanction to what he so strongly disapproved . Laura , too , would pass through this trying time better if she was not distracted by watching him ; she would understand the cause of his absence , and he could trust her to love and comprehend him at a distance , better than he could trust her to hear the marriage - service in his presence without betraying herself . Nor did he wish to hear her again plead for the confession of their engagement ; and , supposing any misadventure should lead to its betrayal , what could be more unpleasant than for it to be revealed at such a time , when Charles would so turn it against him , that all his influence and usefulness would be for ever at an end . Love drew him one way , and consistency another ; Captain Morville had never been so much in the condition of Mahomet 's coffin in his life ; and he grew more angry with his uncle , Charles , and Guy , for having put him in so unpleasant a predicament . So the self - debate lasted all the way to Kilcoran ; and he only had two comforts — one , that he had sent the follower who was always amenable to good advice , safe out of the way of Lady Eveleen , to spend his leave of absence at Thorndale — the other , that Maurice de Courcy was , as yet , ignorant of the Hollywell news , and did not torment him by talking about it . This satisfaction , however , lasted no longer than till their arrival at Kilcoran ; for , the instant they entered the drawing - room , Lady Eveleen exclaimed , '

172606	172637	172558	172559	the Edmonstones	209	' Ah ! your heart has escaped breaking this time , Maurice . It is that little puss , Amy , that has made a great conquest . Now guess . '
172638	172659	172503	172503	Eva	281	' Oh ! young Morville , of course . But what possessed him to take Amy , and leave Laura ? '
172660	172752	172558	172559	the Edmonstones	209	' Perhaps Laura was not to be had . Men are so self - sufficient , that they always think they may pick and choose . Is not it so , Captain Morville ? I like Sir Guy better than most men , but Laura is too good for any one I know . If I could make a perfect hero , I would at once ; only Charles would tell me all the perfect heroes in books are bores . How long have you known of it , Captain Morville ? '
172753	172760	172558	172559	the Edmonstones	209	' For the last ten days . '
172761	172768	172503	172503	Eva	281	' And you never mentioned it ? '
172769	172781	172558	172559	the Edmonstones	209	' I did not know whether they intended to publish it . '
172782	172834	172558	172559	the Edmonstones	209	' Now , Captain Morville , I hope to make some progress in your good opinion . Of course , you believe I ca n't keep a secret ; but what do you think of my having known it ever since last summer , and held my tongue all that time ? '
172835	172842	172844	172844	Philip	454	' A great effort , indeed , '
172848	172868	172844	172844	Philip	454	' It would have been greater , I suppose , if the engagement had been positive , not conditional . '
172869	173016	172558	172559	the Edmonstones	209	' Oh ! every one knew what it must come to . No one could have the least fear of Sir Guy . Yes ; I saw it all . I gave my little aid , and I am sure I have a right to be bridesmaid , as I am to be . Oh ! wo nt it be charming ? It is to be the grandest wedding that ever was seen . It is to be on Whit - Tuesday ; and papa is going to take me and Aunt Charlotte ; for old Aunt Mabel says Aunt Charlotte must go . There are to be six bridesmaids , and a great party at the breakfast ; everything as splendid as possible ; and I made Mrs. Edmonstone promise from the first that we should have a ball . You must go , Maurice . '
173017	173026	172844	172844	Philip	454	' I shall be on the high seas ! '
173027	173054	172844	172844	Philip	454	' Oh yes , that is horrid ! But you do n't sail with the regiment , I think , Captain Morville . You surely go ? '
173055	173061	173063	173063	Philip	454	' I am not certain , '
173110	173114	173116	173116	Maurice	181	' Not certain ! '
173123	173152	173116	173116	Maurice	181	' I am not sure that I shall have time . You know I have been intending to make a walking tour through Switzerland before joining at Corfu . '
173162	173171	173180	173180	Maurice	181	' apart , unfriended , melancholy , slow . ''
173172	173178	173180	173180	Maurice	181	' Very slow , indeed , '
173182	173191	173193	173193	Philip	454	' A wedding is a confused melancholy affair , '
173195	173272	173193	173193	Philip	454	' You know I am no dancing man , Lady Eveleen ; one individual like myself can make little difference to persons engrossed with their own affairs ; I can wish my cousins well from a distance as well as at hand ; and though they have been kind enough to ask me , I think that while their house is overflowing with guests of more mark , my room will be preferred to my company . '
173273	173282	173284	173285	Lady Kilcoran	273	' Then you do not mean to go ? '
173287	173292	173293	173293	she	273	' I do not , '
173296	173326	173293	173293	she	273	' for my health is never equal to so much excitement , and it would only be giving poor Mrs. Edmonstone additional trouble to have to attend to me . '
173327	173336	173338	173338	Eveleen	244	' So you really mean to stay away ! '
173340	173347	173338	173338	Eveleen	244	' I have not entirely decided . '
173348	173365	173367	173367	Eveleen	244	' At any rate , you must go and tell old Aunt Mabel all about them , '
173369	173404	173367	173367	Eveleen	244	' She is so delighted . You will be quite worshipped , at the cottage , for the very name of Morville . I spend whole hours in discoursing on Sir Guy 's perfections . '
173972	173975	173977	173977	Charles	156	' So , '
173979	174003	173977	173977	Charles	156	' there were at the marriage the Picanninies , and the Joblillies , and the Garryulies , but not the Grand Panjandrum himself . '
174004	174013	174015	174015	Charlotte	277	' Nor the little round button at top ! '
174017	174027	174029	174030	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Well , it 's his own look out , '
174032	174043	174029	174030	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' It is of a piece with all the rest . '
174044	174054	174056	174056	Charlotte	277	' I am sure we do n't want him , '
174058	174064	174066	174067	her mother	5185	' Not in this humour , '
174325	174333	174319	174319	He	3342	' It should only be made habitable . '
174817	174857	174858	174858	Guy	150	' Well , Sir Guy ; so , here you are ! You 've lost no time about it , however . A fine pair of young housekeepers , and a pretty example of early marriages for the parish ! '
174861	174892	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' You must come and see the example , Markham . I have a message from Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone , to ask you to come to Hollywell at Whitsuntide . '
174895	174936	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' You are making a fool of me , Sir Guy . What 's a plain old man like me to do among all your lords and ladies , and finery and flummery ? I 'll do no such thing . '
174937	174943	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' Not to oblige me ? '
174944	174957	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' Oblige you ? Nonsense ! Much you 'll care for me ! '
174958	175011	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' Nay , Markham , you must not stay away . You , my oldest and best friend,—my only home friend . I owe all my present happiness to you , and it would really be a great disappointment to me if you did not come . She wishes it , too . '
175012	175018	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' Well , Sir Guy , '
175027	175066	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' if you do choose to make a fool of me , I ca n't help it . You must have your own way ; though you might have found a friend that would do you more credit . '
175067	175077	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' Then I may say that you will come ? '
175078	175101	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' Say I am very much obliged to Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone for their invitation . It is very handsome of them . '
175102	175119	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' Then you will have the settlements ready by that time . You must , Markham . '
175120	175127	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' I 'll see about it . '
175128	175142	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' And the house must be ready to come home to at once . '
175143	175157	175159	175159	Markham	157	' You do n't know what you are talking of , Sir Guy ! '
175167	175187	175159	175159	Markham	157	' Yes , I do . We do n't intend to turn the house upside down with new furniture . '
175188	175252	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' You may talk as you please , Sir Guy ; but I know what 's what ; and it is mere nonsense to talk of bringing a lady to a house in this condition . A pretty notion you have of what is fit for your bride ! I hope she knows what sort of care you mean to take of her ! '
175253	175259	175261	175261	Guy	150	' She will be satisfied , '
175263	175283	175261	175261	Guy	150	' She particularly wishes not to have everything disarranged . I only must have two rooms furnished for her . '
175284	175304	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' But the place wants painting from head to foot ; and the roof is in such a state — '
175305	175313	174893	174893	Grunt	393	' The roof ? That 's serious ! '
175314	175339	175261	175261	Guy	150	' Serious ! I believe so . You 'll have it about your ears in no time , if you do n't look sharp . '
175340	175347	175349	175349	Guy	150	' I 'll look this minute , '
175354	175361	175349	175349	Guy	150	' Will you come with me ? '
175663	175670	175672	175672	he	150	' You have heard about Charles ? '
175698	175702	175704	175705	Mrs. Ashford	332	' Not much , '
175707	175716	175704	175705	Mrs. Ashford	332	' Is he entirely confined to the sofa ? '
175717	175869	175873	175874	Mrs. Ashford	332	' He can not move without crutches ; but no one could guess what he is without seeing him . He is so patient , his spirits never flag ; and it is beautiful to see how considerate he is , and what interest he takes in all the things he never can share , poor fellow . I do n't know what Hollywell would be without Charlie ! I wonder how soon he will be able to come here ! Hardly this year , I am afraid , for things must be comfortable for him ; and I shall never get them so without Amy , and then it will be autumn . Well ; what next ! Oh , you said window - curtains . Some blue sort of stuff , I suppose , like the drawing - room ones at Hollywell . What 's the name of it ? '
175995	176034	175991	175991	he	3380	' Better do things while we may . The thought of this unhappy place is enough to poison everything ; and I do n't think I could rest without knowing that the utmost was being done for it . '
176069	176091	176092	176092	he	3380	' It wo nt hurt them to have one first . Let them make sure of all the fun they can , '
176263	177167	176235	176235	he	5593	' content . He laughed at their hoard of scraps of the wood of the wreck , which they said their mamma had desired them to fetch for her . So many avocations came upon Guy at once,—so many of the neighbours came to call on him,—such varieties of people wanted to speak to him,—the boys followed him so constantly,—and he had so many invitations from Mr. Wellwood and the Ashfords , that he never had any time for himself , except what must be spent in writing to Amabel . There was a feeling upon him , that he must have time to commune with himself , and rest from this turmoil of occupation , in the solitude of which Redclyffe had hitherto been so full . He wanted to be alone with his old home , and take leave of it , and of the feelings of his boyhood , before beginning on this new era of his life ; but whenever he set out for a solitary walk , before he could even get to the top of the crag , either Markham marched up to talk over some important question,—a farmer waylaid him to make some request,—some cottager met him , to tell of a grievance,—Mr . Wellwood rode over,—or the Ashford boys rushed up , and followed like his shadow . At length , on Ascension day , the last before he was to leave Redclyffe , with a determination that he would escape for once from his pursuers , he walked to the Cove as soon as he returned from morning service , launched his little boat , and pushed off into the rippling , whispering waters . It was a resumption of the ways of his boyhood ; it seemed like a holiday , to have left all these cares behind him , just as it used to be when all his lessons were prepared , and he had leave to disport himself , by land or water , the whole afternoon , provided he did not go out beyond the Shag Rock . He took up his sculls and rowed merrily , singing and whistling to keep time with their dash ; the return to the old pleasure quite enough at first , the salt breeze , the dashing waves , the motion of the boat . So he went on till he had come as far as his former boundary , then he turned , and gazed back on the precipitous rocks , cleft with deep fissures , marbled with veins of different shades of red , and tufted here and there with clumps of samphire , grass , and a little brushwood , bright with the early green of spring . The white foam and spray were leaping against their base , and roaring in their hollows ; the tract of wavelets between glittered in light , or heaved green under the shadow of the passing clouds ; the sea - birds floated smoothly in sweeping undulating lines , As though life 's only call and care Were graceful motion ; the hawks poised themselves high in air near the rocks . The Cove lay in sunshine , its rough stone chimneys and rude slate roofs overgrown with moss and fern , rising rapidly , one above the other , in the fast descending hollow , through which a little stream rushed to the sea , — more quietly than its brother , which , at some space distant , fell sheer down over the crag in a white line of foam , brawling with a tone of its own , distinguishable among all the voices of the sea contending with the rocks . Above the village , in the space where the outline of two hills met and crossed , rose the pinnacled tower of the village church , the unusual height of which was explained by the old custom of lighting a beaconfire on its summit , to serve as a guide to the boats at sea . Still higher , apparently on the very brow of the beetling crag that frowned above , stood the old Gothic hall , crumbling and lofty , a fit eyrie for the eagles of Morville . The sunshine was indeed full upon it ; but it served to show how many of the dark windows were without the lining of blinds and curtains , that alone gives the look of life and habitation to a house . How crumbled by sea - wind were the old walls , and the aspect altogether full of a dreary haughtiness , suiting with the whole of the stories connected with its name , from the time when it was said the very dogs crouched and fled from the presence of the sacrilegious murderer of the Archbishop , to the evening when the heir of the line lay stretched a corpse before his father 's gate . Guy sat resting on his oars , gazing at the scene , full of happiness , yet with a sense that it might be too bright to last , as if it scarcely befitted one like himself . The bliss before him , though it was surely a beam from heaven , was so much above him , that he hardly dared to believe it real : like a child repeating , '
177177	177477	176235	176235	he	5593	' and pausing before it will venture to grasp at a prize beyond its hopes . He feared to trust himself fully , lest it should carry him away from his self - discipline , and dazzle him too much to let him keep his gaze on the light beyond ; and he rejoiced in this time of quiet , to enable him to strive for power over his mind , to prevent himself from losing in gladness the balance he had gained in adversity . It was such a check as he might have wished for , to look at that grim old castle , recollect who he was , and think of the frail tenure of all earthly joy , especially for one of the house of Morville . Could that abode ever be a home for a creature like Amy , with the bright innocent mirth that seemed too soft and sweet ever to be overshadowed by gloom and sorrow ? Perhaps she might be early taken from him in the undimmed beauty of her happiness and innocence , and he might have to struggle through a long lonely life , with only the remembrance of short - lived joy to lighten it ; and when he reflected that this was only a melancholy fancy , the answer came from within , that there was nothing peculiar to him in the perception that earthly happiness was fleeting . It was best that so it should be , and that he should rest in the trust that brightened on him through all,—that neither life nor death , sorrow nor pain , could separate , for ever , him and his Amy . And he looked up into the deep blue sky over head , murmuring to himself , '
177491	177520	177535	177535	him	3389	' and gazed long and intently , as he rocked on the green waters , till he again spoke to himself,—'Why stand ye here gazing up into heaven ? '
177868	177879	177881	177881	Amy	425	' That will not be pleasure - hunting , certainly , '
177901	177920	177898	177898	she	425	' I mean , unless you could convince him , and then it would be more than pleasure . '
177921	177931	177933	177933	Guy	150	' It would be my first of unattained wishes , '
177935	177943	177933	177933	Guy	150	' Then we will enjoy the journey . '
177944	177951	177898	177898	she	425	' No fear on that score . '
177952	177986	177898	177898	she	425	' And for fear we should get too much into the stream of enjoyment , as people abroad forget home - duties , let us stick to some fixed time for coming back . '
177987	177997	177933	177933	Guy	150	' You said Redclyffe would be ready by Michaelmas . '
177998	178030	177898	177898	she	425	' I have told the builder it must be . So , Amy , as far as it depends on ourselves , we are determined to be at home by Michaelmas . '
178508	178516	178520	178520	Charles	156	' When shall we three meet again ! '
178530	178534	178536	178536	Amy	425	' And where ? '
178538	178541	178543	178543	Charles	156	' Here , '
178545	178559	178543	178543	Charles	156	' you will come here to tell your adventures and take up Bustle . '
178560	178565	178567	178567	Guy	150	' I hope so , '
178569	178593	178567	178567	Guy	150	' We could not help it . The telling you about it will be a treat to look forward to all the time . '
178594	178615	178543	178543	Charles	156	' Yes , your sight - seeing is a public benefit . You have seen many a thing for me . '
178616	178633	178635	178635	Guy	150	' That is the pleasure of seeing and hearing , the thing that is not fleeting , '
178637	178645	178647	178647	Charles	156	' The unselfish part , you mean , '
178661	178667	178654	178654	Guy	150	' There are the people ! '
178678	178687	178654	178654	Guy	150	' Shall I wheel you home , Charlie ? '
178688	178693	178694	178694	Guy	150	' Yes , do . '
178719	178759	178707	178707	he	150	' Wherever or whenever we may be destined to meet , Charlie , or if never again , I must thank you for a great part of my happiness here — for a great deal of kindness and sympathy . '
178769	178851	178760	178760	Charles	156	' The kindness was all on your part . I had nothing to give in return but ill - temper and exactions . But , Guy , you must not think I have not felt all you have done for me . You have made a new man of me , instead of a wretched stick , laughing at my misery , to persuade myself and others that I did not feel it . I hope you are proud of it . '
178852	178863	178760	178760	Charles	156	' As if I had anything to do with it ! '
178864	178911	178912	178912	he	3420	' Had n't you , that 's all ! I know what you wo nt deny , at any rate,—what a capital man of all - work you have been to me , when I had no right to ask it , as now we have , '
178935	178949	178918	178918	Amy	425	' When you come back , you 'll see me treat you as indeed '
178956	179069	178918	178918	Amy	425	'' This talk retarded them a little , and they did not reach the house till the guests were arriving . The first sight that met the eyes of Aunt Charlotte and Lady Eveleen , as they entered , was , in the frame of the open window , Guy 's light agile figure , assisting Charles up the step , his brilliant hazel eyes and glowing healthy complexion contrasting with Charles 's pale , fair , delicate face , and features sharpened and refined by suffering . Amy , her deep blushes and downcast eyes almost hidden by her glossy curls , stood just behind , carrying her brother 's crutch . '
179074	179099	179071	179071	they	3423	' cried Miss Edmonstone , springing forward from her brother and his wife , and throwing her arms round Amy in a warm embrace . '
179120	179121	179122	179122	I	0	' '
179132	179159	179129	179129	Amy	425	' whispered Eveleen , as Amy passed to her embrace ; while Aunt Charlotte hastily kissed Charles , and proceeded—'I do n't wait for an introduction ; '
179167	179181	179183	179184	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Ay , did I say a word too much in his praise ? '
179186	179201	179183	179184	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Is n't he all out as fine a fellow as I told you ? '
179271	179277	179279	179279	Guy	150	' You know him already , '
179290	179299	179282	179282	Amy	425	' Yes , I am sure I do . '
179327	179333	179335	179335	Amy	425	' And the little girl ? '
179337	179360	179335	179335	Amy	425	' O yes,—I picked her up at St. Mildred 's : one of the servants took charge of her in the hall . '
179361	179367	179369	179369	Charlotte	277	' I 'll fetch her , '
179706	179720	179700	179700	she	3433	' Now tell me , is Captain Morville pleased about this or not ? '
179753	179762	179750	179750	Charlotte	277	' What has he been saying about it ? '
179763	179776	179700	179700	she	3433	' Saying ? O nothing . But why does not he come ? '
179777	179788	179790	179790	Laura	454	' You have seen him more lately than we have , '
179792	179798	179800	179800	Eveleen	244	' That is an evasion , '
179802	179830	179800	179800	Eveleen	244	' as if you did not know more of his mind than I could ever get at , if I saw him every day of my life . '

179844	179866	179842	179842	Charlotte	277	' I am sure we do n't want him ; but Laura and Guy will both of them take his part . '
180053	180063	180065	180065	she	244	' So , he was banished , regularly banished ! '
180067	180078	180065	180065	she	244	' However , of course Amy never gave him up . '
180079	180089	180028	180028	Eveleen	244	' Oh , she never mistrusted him one minute . '
180090	180108	180065	180065	she	244	' And while he had her fast , it was little he would care for the rest . '
180109	180125	180126	180126	Eveleen	244	' Yes , if he had known it , but she could not tell him . '
180130	180139	180141	180141	Charlotte	277	' But I am sure she did not , '
180146	180156	180141	180141	Charlotte	277	' You know nothing about it , my dear . '
180157	180182	180065	180065	she	244	' Yes , but I do ; for mamma said to Charlie how beautifully she did behave , and he too,—never attempting any intercourse . '
180183	180192	180065	180065	she	244	' Very good of you to believe it . '
180193	180203	180205	180205	Charlotte	277	' I am sure of it , certain sure , '
180207	180223	180065	180065	she	244	' How could you venture to think they would either of them do anything wrong ? '
180224	180232	180065	180065	she	244	' I did not say they would , '
180233	180256	180065	180065	she	244	' What , not to write to each other when papa had forbidden it , and do so in secret , too ? '
180257	180292	180065	180065	she	244	' My dear , do n't look so innocently irate . Goodness has nothing to do with it , it would be only a moderate constancy . You know nothing at all of lovers . '
180293	180332	180065	180065	she	244	' If I know nothing of lovers , I know a great deal of Amy and Guy , and I am quite sure nothing on earth would tempt them to do anything in secret that they were forbidden . '
180333	180348	180065	180065	she	244	' Wait till you are in love , and you 'll change your mind . '
180349	180358	180360	180360	Charlotte	277	' I never mean to be in love , '

180543	180544	180545	180545	She	281	' '

180660	180813	180652	180652	she	281	' Charles , however , was not sorry when Eveleen came to sit by him , for a bantering conversation with her was the occupation of which he was most capable . Amy , returning , came and sat in her old place beside him , with her hand in his , and her quiet eyes fixed on the ground . The last evening for many weeks that she would thus sit with him,—the last that she would ever be a part of his home . She had already ceased to belong entirely to him ; she who had always been the most precious to him , except his mother . Only his mother could have been a greater loss,—he could not dwell on the anticipation ; and still holding her hand , he roused himself to listen , and answer gaily to Eveleen 's description of the tutor , Mr. Fielder , '
180860	180864	180853	180853	he	3452	' Eveleen said , '
180889	180890	180872	180872	Maurice	181	' '
180908	180923	180901	180901	they	6987	' said Charles , talking at random , in hopes of saying something laughable . '
180986	180987	180984	180984	Venus	447	' '
180998	180999	180989	180989	you	3456	' '

181072	181076	181056	181056	he	3452	' said Charlotte , '

181106	181341	181342	181342	Mamma	155	' So talked on Eveleen , and Charles answered her as much in her own fashion as he could , and when at last the evening came to an end , every one felt relieved . Laura lingered long in Amy 's room , perceiving that hitherto she had only known half the value of her sister , her sweet sister . It would be worse than ever now , when left with the others , all so much less sympathizing , all saying sharp things of Philip , none to cling to her with those winsome ways that had been unnoted till the time when they were no more to console her , and she felt them to have been the only charm that had softened her late dreary desolation . So full was her heart , that she must have told Amy all her grief but for the part that Philip had acted towards Guy , and her doubts of Guy would not allow her the consolation of dwelling on Amy 's happiness , which cheered the rest . She could only hang about her in speechless grief , and caress her fondly , while Amy cried , and tried to comfort her , till her mother came to wish her good - night . Mrs. Edmonstone did not stay long , because she wished Amy , if possible , to rest . '
181344	181355	181342	181342	Mamma	155	' said Amy , as she received her last kiss , '
181367	181368	181361	181361	I	0	' '
181380	181492	181493	181493	Charlie	156	' said Mrs. Edmonstone . Amabel slept , and awakened to the knowledge that it was her wedding - day . She was not to appear at the first breakfast , but she came to meet Charles in the dressing - room ; and as they sat together on the sofa , where she had watched and amused so many of his hours of helplessness , he clasped round her arm his gift,—a bracelet of their mother 's hair . His fingers trembled and his eyes were hazy , but he would not let her help him . Her thanks were obliged to be all kisses , no words would come but '
181507	181508	181499	181499	I	0	' '
181527	181547	181551	181551	Charlie	156	' It was impossible not to smile , though it was but for a moment,—Charles 's mirth was melancholy . '
181570	181571	181565	181565	Charlotte	277	' '
181725	181806	181811	181811	Guy	150	' he added , as Guy knocked at his door , to offer to help him down stairs . Guy hardly spoke , and Amy could not look in his face . It was late , and he took down Charles at once . After this she had very little quiet , every one was buzzing about her , and putting the last touches to her dress ; at last , just as she was quite finished , Charlotte exclaimed , '
181825	181863	181864	181864	I	0	' Mrs. Edmonstone did not say no ; and Charlotte , opening the dressing - room door , called to him . He stood opposite to Amy for some moments , then said , with a smile , '
181884	182604	182611	182611	Charlotte	277	' It seemed to Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura that these words made them lose sight of the details of lace and silk that had been occupying them , so that they only saw the radiance , purity , and innocence of Amy 's bridal appearance . No more was said , for Mr. Edmonstone ran up to call Guy , who was to drive Charles in the pony carriage . Amabel , of course , went with her parents . Poor child ! her tears flowed freely on the way , and Mr. Edmonstone , now that it had really come to the point of parting with his little Amy , was very much overcome , while his wife , hardly refraining from tears , could only hold her daughter 's hand very close . The regular morning service was a great comfort , by restoring their tranquillity , and by the time it was ended , Amabel 's countenance had settled into its own calm expression of trust and serenity . She scarcely even trembled when her father led her forward ; her hand did not shake , and her voice , though very low , was firm and audible ; while Guy 's deep , sweet tones had a sort of thrill and quiver of intense feeling . No one could help observing that Laura was the most agitated person present ; she trembled so much that she was obliged to lean on Charlotte , and her tears gave the infection to the other bridesmaids — all but Mary Ross , who could never cry when other people did , and little Marianne , who did nothing but look and wonder . Mary was feeling a great deal , both of compassion for the bereaved family and of affectionate admiring joy for the young pair who knelt before the altar . It was a showery day , with gleams of vivid sunshine , and one of these suddenly broke forth , casting a stream of colour from a martyr 's figure in the south window , so as to shed a golden glory on the wave of brown hair over Guy 's forehead , then passing on and tinting the bride 's white veil with a deep glowing shade of crimson and purple . Either that golden light , or the expression of the face on which it beamed , made Mary think of the lines — Where is the brow to wear in mortal 's sight , The crown of pure angelic light ? Charles stood with his head leaning against a pillar , as if he could not bear to look up ; Mr. Edmonstone , was restless and almost sobbing ; Mrs. Edmonstone alone collected , though much flushed and somewhat trembling , while the only person apparently free from excitement was the little bride , as there she knelt , her hand clasped in his , her head bent down , her modest , steadfast face looking as if she was only conscious of the vow she exchanged , the blessing she received ; and was , as it were , lifted out of herself . It was over now . The feast , in its fullest sense was held , and the richest of blessings had been called down on them . The procession came out of the vestry in full order , and very pretty it was ; the bride and bridegroom in the fresh bright graciousness of their extreme youth , and the six bridesmaids following ; Laura and Lady Eveleen , two strikingly handsome and elegant girls ; Charlotte , with the pretty little fair Marianne ; Mary Ross , and Grace Harper . The village people who stood round might well say that such a sight as that was worth coming twenty miles to see . The first care , after the bridal pair had driven off , was to put Charles into his pony - carriage . Charlotte , who had just pinned on his favour , begged to drive him , for she meant to make him her especial charge , and to succeed to all Amy 's rights . Mrs. Edmonstone asked whether Laura would not prefer going with him , but she hastily answered , '
182613	182637	182611	182611	Charlotte	277	' for with her troubled feelings , she could better answer talking girls than parry the remarks of her shrewd , observant brother . '
182651	182658	182660	182660	Charles	156	' Come , then , puss , '
182666	182680	182681	182681	Charlotte	277	' only do n't upset me , or it will spoil their tour . '
182696	182709	182693	182693	she	277	' Well ! he is our brother , and all is safe . '
182710	182713	182715	182715	Charles	156	' Yes , '
182717	182724	182715	182715	Charles	156	' no more fears for them . '
182725	182738	182693	182693	she	277	' Had you any ? I am very glad if you had . '
182739	182742	182693	182693	she	277	' Why ? '
182743	182773	182715	182715	Charles	156	' Because it was so like a book . I had a sort of feeling , all the time , that Philip would come in quite grand and terrible . '
182774	182819	182693	182693	she	277	' As if he must act Ogre . I am not sure that I had not something of the same notion,—that he might appear suddenly , and forbid the banns , entirely for Amy 's sake , and as the greatest kindness to her . '
182820	182823	182693	182693	she	277	' Oh ! '
182824	182906	182715	182715	Charles	156	' However , he ca n't separate them now , let him do his worst ; and while Amy is Guy 's wife , I do n't think we shall easily be made to quarrel . I am glad the knot is tied , for I had a fatality notion that the feud was so strong , that it was nearly a case of the mountains bending and the streams ascending , ere she was to be our foeman 's bride . '
182907	182910	182912	182912	Charlotte	277	' No , '
182914	182975	182912	182912	Charlotte	277	' it ought to be like that story of Rosaura and her kindred , do n't you remember ? The fate would not be appeased by the marriage , till Count Julius had saved the life of one of the hostile race . That would be it , — perhaps they will meet abroad . and Guy will do it . '
182976	183026	182693	182693	she	277	' That wo nt do . Philip will never endanger his precious life , nor ever forgive Guy the obligation . Well , I suppose there never was a prettier wedding — how silly of me to say so , I shall be sick of hearing it before night . '
183027	183086	182693	182693	she	277	' I do wish all these people were gone ; I did not know it would be so horrid . I should like to shut myself up and cry , and think what I could ever do to wait on you . Indeed , Charlie , I know I never can be like Amy , but if you — '
183087	183104	183106	183106	Charles	156	' Be anything but sentimental , I do n't want to make a fool of myself , '
183122	183160	183115	183115	he	156	' Depend upon it if we were left to ourselves this evening , we should be so desperately savage that we should quarrel furiously , and there would be no Amy to set us to - rights . '
183161	183176	182693	182693	she	277	' How Aunt Charlotte did cry ! What a funny little woman she is . '
183177	183203	182693	182693	she	277	' Yes , I see now who you take after , puss . You 'll be just like her , when you are her age . '
183204	183228	183115	183115	he	156	' So I mean to be,—I mean to stay and take care of you all my life , as she does of grandmamma . '
183229	183236	182693	182693	she	277	' You do , do you ? '
183237	183262	182693	182693	she	277	' Yes . I never mean to marry , it is so disagreeable . O dear ! But how lovely dear Amy did look . '
183263	183269	183271	183271	Charles	156	' Here 's the rain ! '
183424	183432	183447	183447	his	150	' Charlotte , how wet you are . '
183433	183441	183442	183442	She	277	' Never mind , Charlie is not . '
183469	183474	183461	183463	her new brother	3471	' Where 's Amy ? '
183475	183478	183481	183481	Guy	150	' Here ! '
183495	183496	183486	183486	Charlotte	277	' '

183522	183523	183507	183507	Charlotte	277	' '
183540	183572	183573	183574	O Amy	452	' said Amy , flying nimbly up the stairs , — up even to Charlotte 's own room , the old nursery , and there she was unfastening the drenched finery . '
183586	183587	183573	183574	O Amy	452	' '
183618	183619	183623	183623	Amy	452	' '
183629	183655	183623	183623	Amy	452	' Charlotte made prisoner the left hand , and looked up with an arch smile at the face where she had called up a blush . '
183667	183668	183656	183657	Lady Morville	425	' '
183693	183709	183710	183710	We	3478	' Amy 's voice trembled , and Charlotte held her fast to kiss her again . '
183715	183722	183710	183710	We	3478	' said Amy , recovering herself . '
183728	183761	183763	183763	he	3480	' While the frock was being fastened , Charlotte looked into the Prayer - book Amy had laid down . There was the name , Amabel Frances Morville , and the date . '
183768	183772	183763	183763	he	3480	' said Charlotte . '
183780	183781	183763	183763	he	3480	' '

183809	184281	183803	183803	I	0	' said Amy . At that moment Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura hastened in . Then was the time for broken words , tears , and smiles , as Amy leant against her mother , who locked her in a close embrace , and gazed on her in a sort of trance , at once of maternal pride and of pain , at giving up her cherished nestling . Poor Laura ! how bitter were her tears , and how forced her smiles,—far unlike the rest ! No one would care to hear the details of the breakfast , and the splendours of the cake ; how Charlotte recovered her spirits while distributing the favours ; and Lady Eveleen set up a flirtation with Markham , and forced him into wearing one , though he protested , with many a grunt , that she was making a queer fool of him ; how often Charles was obliged to hear it had been a pretty wedding ; and how well Lord Kilcoran made his speech , proposing the health of Sir Guy and Lady Morville . All the time , Laura was active and useful,—feeling as if she was acting a play , sustaining the character of Miss Edmonstone , the bridesmaid at her sister 's happy marriage ; while the true Laura , Philip 's Laura , was lonely , dejected , wretched ; half fearing for her sister , half jealous of her happiness , forced into pageantry with an aching heart,—with only one wish , that it was over , and that she might be again alone with her burthen . She was glad when her mother rose , and the ladies moved into the drawing - room,—glad to escape from Eveleen 's quick eye , and to avoid Mary 's clear sense , — glad to talk to comparative strangers,—glad of the occupation of going to prepare Amabel for her journey . This lasted a long time,—there was so much to be said , and hearts were so full , and Amy over again explained to Charlotte how to perform all the little services to Charles which she relinquished ; while her mother had so many affectionate last words , and every now and then stopped short to look at her little daughter , saying , she did not know if it was not a dream . At length Amabel was dressed in her purple and white shot silk , her muslin mantle , and white bonnet . Mrs. Edmonstone left her and Laura to have a few words together , and went to the dressing - room . There she found Guy , leaning on the mantel - shelf , as he used to do when he brought his troubles to her . He started as she entered . '
184289	184293	184294	184294	I	0	' he said . '

184343	184354	184335	184335	You	3488	' he proceeded , in a low , reflecting tone . '
184394	184431	184388	184388	I	0	' He was silent ; and Mrs. Edmonstone , little able to find words , smiling , tried to say,—'I little thought how truly and how gladly I should be able to call you my son ; '
184442	184451	184453	184453	Guy,—'half	455	' I wish I could tell you half , '

184613	184680	184681	184681	Laura	454	' Laura at this moment came in . Alone with Amy , she could not speak , she could only cry ; and , fearful of distressing her sister , she came away ; but here , with Guy , it was worse , for it was unkind not to speak one warm word to him . Yet what could she say ? He spoke first — '
184712	184721	184723	184723	you	454	' Laura gave her sad , forced smile . '
184757	184758	184723	184723	you	454	' '

184934	184968	184921	184921	he	454	' Laura wept still more ; but she could never again lose the sisterly feeling those kind words had awakened . If Philip had but known what he missed ! Charlotte ran in . '
185001	185006	184992	184992	You	454	' Your affectionate brother ! ''
185007	185015	185025	185026	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' I wo n't forget , Charlotte . '
185016	185023	185025	185026	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Guy ! Where 's Guy ? '
185028	185051	185025	185026	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' The rain 's going off . You must come down , both of you , or you 'll be too late . '
185173	185199	185153	185153	Charles	156	' Amy , woman , you do us credit ! Well , write soon , and do n't break your heart for want of me . '
185248	185292	185240	185241	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Good bye , good bye , my own dearest little one ! Bless you , bless you ! and may you be as happy as a Mayflower ! Guy , good bye . I 've given you the best I had to give,—and '
185323	185348	185349	185349	Charlotte	277	' Guy 's face and grasping hand were the reply . As he was about to spring into the carriage , he turned again . '

185437	185464	185435	185435	Grunt	393	' Lastly , as if he could not help it , Guy dashed up the step once more , pressed Charles 's hand , and said , '
185471	185535	185469	185469	Charlie	156	' In an instant he was beside Amabel , and they drove off,—Amabel leaning forward , and gazing wistfully at her mother and Charles , till she was startled by a long cluster of laburnums , their yellow bloom bent down and heavy with wet , so that the ends dashed against her bonnet , and the crystal drops fell on her lap . '
185551	185617	185538	185538	Amy	425	' She gave a sweet , sunny smile through her tears . At that moment they came beyond the thick embowering shrubs , while full before them was the dark receding cloud , on which the sunbeams were painting a wide spanned rainbow . The semicircle was perfect , and full before them , like an arch of triumph under which they were to pass . '
185621	185627	185628	185628	Guy	150	' broke from them both . '
185630	185651	185628	185628	Guy	150	' said the bride , after a few minutes had faded the rainbow , and turned them from its sight , '

185700	185711	185713	185713	Guy	150	' said Guy . Burns . Look here , Amy , '
185727	185731	185732	185732	she	3517	' Captain Morville ! '
185735	185747	185732	185732	she	3517	' July 14th . That was only the day before yesterday . '
185748	185767	185769	185769	Guy	150	' I wonder whether we shall overtake him ! Do you know what was this gentleman 's route ? '
185837	185848	185815	185822	the guide , who was likely to know	3519	' I dare say we shall hear of him elsewhere . '
186607	186612	186613	186613	she	234	' Guy ! Guy ! '
186631	186634	186628	186628	her,—he	234	' Here ! '
186635	186641	186642	186642	she	234	' Oh , help me ! '
186667	186678	186679	186679	she	234	' Take care ! do n't come on the grass ! '
186710	186718	186721	186721	his	3539	' I am coming — hold fast ! '
186781	186785	186786	186786	he	3539	' Now then ! '
186799	186826	186786	186786	he	3539	' I can not reach you unless you raise up your hand to me — your left hand — straight up . Let go . Now ! '
187021	187025	187026	187026	he	3539	' Thank heaven ! '
187040	187052	187026	187026	he	3539	' Thank God ! my Amy , I have you still . '
187147	187164	187138	187138	she	456	' Oh ! it was dreadful ! I did not think you could have saved me . '
187165	187174	187176	187176	Guy	150	' I thought so too for a moment ! '
187183	187198	187176	187176	Guy	150	' You are better now ? You are not hurt ? are you sure ? '
187199	187227	187228	187228	She	456	' Quite sure ! I did not fall , you know , only slipped . No , I have nothing the matter with me , thank you . '
187263	187301	187255	187255	her	456	' Yes , quite unhurt — quite well ; only this wrist is a little strained , and no wonder . Oh , I am sure it was a Providence that made those bushes grow just there ! '
187302	187308	187255	187255	her	456	' How did it happen ? '
187309	187346	187347	187347	She	456	' It was my fault . I went after a flower ; my foot slipped on the turf , and I could not stop myself . I thought I should have run right down the precipice ! '
187356	187361	187362	187362	he	3539	' It was frightful ! '
187369	187390	187362	187362	he	3539	' It was a great mercy indeed ! Thank Heaven , it is over ! You are not giddy now ? '
187391	187400	187255	187255	her	456	' Oh , no ; not at all ! '
187401	187406	187255	187255	her	456	' And your wrist ! '
187407	187426	187428	187428	Amy	425	' Oh , that 's nothing . I only told you to show you what was the worst , '
187443	187449	187428	187428	Amy	425	' What flower was it ? '
187450	187473	187255	187255	her	456	' A piece of purple saxifrage . I thought there was no danger , for it did not seem steep at first . '
187474	187497	187255	187255	her	456	' No ; it was not your fault . You had better not move just yet ; sit still a little while . '
187498	187507	187428	187428	Amy	425	' O Guy , where are you going ! '
187508	187531	187255	187255	her	456	' Only for your sketching tools and my stick . I shall not be gone an instant . Sit still and recover . '
187552	187559	187560	187560	she	425	' Oh , I am sorry , '
187568	187586	187560	187560	she	425	' I wish I had told you I did not care for them . Why did you ? '
187587	187608	187536	187536	he	3539	' I did not put myself in any peril about them . I had my trusty staff , you know . '
187609	187663	187560	187560	she	425	' I am glad I did not guess what you were doing . I thought it so impossible , that I did not think of begging you not . I shall keep them always . It is a good thing for us to be put in mind how frail all our joy is . '
187664	187667	187669	187669	Guy	285	' All ? '
187699	187708	187695	187695	he	285	' Your joy no man taketh from you . '
188014	188021	188023	188024	the cavaliere	3553	' There is one good thing , '
188031	188058	188023	188024	the cavaliere	3553	' we can find the captain now . I 'll write and ask him — shall I say to meet us at Varenna or at Bellagio ? '
188059	188078	188023	188024	the cavaliere	3553	' Whichever suits him best , I should think . It ca n't make much difference to us . '
188079	188087	188089	188089	Guy	150	' Your voice has a disconsolate cadence , '
188098	188105	188106	188106	she	7315	' I did not mean it , '
188109	188137	188106	188106	she	7315	' I have not a word to say against it . It is quite right , and I am sure I do n't wish to do otherwise . '
188138	188152	188023	188024	the cavaliere	3553	' Only it is the first drawback in our real day - dream . '
188153	188162	188164	188164	Amy	425	' Just so , and that is all , '
188166	188185	188164	188164	Amy	425	' I am glad you feel the same , not that I want you to change your mind . '
188186	188221	188023	188024	the cavaliere	3553	' Do n't you remember our resolution against mere pleasure - hunting ? That adventure at Interlachen seemed to be meant to bring us up short just as we were getting into that line . '
188222	188228	188023	188024	the cavaliere	3553	' You think we were ? '
188229	188257	188164	188164	Amy	425	' I was , at least ; for I know it was a satisfaction not to find a letter , to say Redclyffe was ready for us . '
188258	188268	188023	188024	the cavaliere	3553	' I had rather it was Redclyffe than Philip . '
188269	188373	188023	188024	the cavaliere	3553	' To be sure , I would not change my own dancing leaping waves for this clear blue looking - glass of a lake , or even those white peaks . I want you to make friends with those waves , Amy . But it is a more real matter to make friends with Philip , the one wish of my life . Not that I exactly expect to clear matters up , but if some move is not made now , when it may , we shall stand aloof for life , and there will be the feud where it was before . '
188374	188380	188382	188382	Amy	425	' It is quite right , '
188384	188423	188382	188382	Amy	425	' I dare say that , meeting so far from home , he will be glad so see us , and to hear the Hollywell news . I little thought last autumn where I should meet him again . '
188689	188710	188670	188670	Guy	150	' How d'ye do , Philip ? I am glad we have caught you at last . Here she is . '
188811	188855	188790	188790	she	234	' I have your letters in my knapsack ; I will unpack them as soon as we get to the hotel . I thought it safer not to send them in search of you again , as we were to meet so soon . '
188856	188863	188790	188790	she	234	' Certainly . Are there many ? '
188864	188898	188790	188790	she	234	' One for each of you , both from Hollywell . I was very sorry to have engrossed them ; but not knowing you were so near , I only gave my surname . '
188899	188906	188908	188908	Guy	150	' It was lucky for us , '
188910	188938	188908	188908	Guy	150	' otherwise we could not have traced you . We saw your name at Altdorf , and have been trying to come up with you ever since . '
188939	188954	188790	188790	she	234	' I am glad we have met . What accounts have you from home ? '
188955	188958	188960	188960	Amy	425	' Excellent , '
188962	188986	188960	188960	Amy	425	' Charlie is uncommonly well , he has been out of doors a great deal , and has even dined out several times . '
188987	188993	188790	188790	she	234	' I am very glad . '
188994	189007	188790	188790	she	234	' You know he has been improving ever since his great illness . '
189008	189021	189023	189023	Guy	150	' You would be surprised to see how much better he moves , '
189025	189033	189023	189023	Guy	150	' he helps himself so much more . '
189034	189044	188790	188790	she	234	' Can he set his foot to the ground ? '
189045	189048	189050	189050	Amy	425	' No , '
189052	189080	189050	189050	Amy	425	' there is no hope of that ; but he is more active , because his general health is improved ; he can sleep and eat more . '
189081	189095	189096	189096	Amabel	234	' I always thought exertion would do more for him than anything else . '
189151	189170	189140	189140	Guy	150	' Walking over the hills from Como . Do you always travel in this fashion , impedimentis relictis ? '
189174	189178	189140	189140	Guy	150	' said Guy ; '
189194	189195	189192	189192	Arnaud	186	' '
189203	189204	189201	189201	you	150	' '
189211	189237	189238	189238	She	460	' said Amy ; for her maid was a Stylehurst person , who had lived at Hollywell ever since she had been fit for service . '
189252	189253	189238	189238	She	460	' '
189266	189270	189260	189260	she	460	' said Guy . '
189306	189307	189271	189271	Their	3574	' '
189313	189317	189271	189271	Their	3574	' said Amy . '
189411	189412	189394	189394	she	460	' '
189423	189950	189394	189394	she	460	' said Philip . They were fast losing the stiffness of first meeting . Philip could not but acknowledge to himself that Amy was looking very well , and so happy that Guy must be fulfilling the condition on which he was to be borne with . However , these were early days , and of course Guy must be kind to her at least in the honeymoon , before the wear and tear of life began . They both looked so young , that , having advised them to wait four years , he was ready to charge them with youthfulness , if not as a fault , at least as a folly ; indeed , the state of his own affairs made him inclined to think it a foible , almost a want of patience , in any one to marry before thirty . It was a conflict of feeling . Guy was so cordial and good - humoured , that he could not help being almost gained ; but on the other hand , he had always thought Guy 's manners eminently agreeable ; and as happiness always made people good - humoured , this was no reason for relying on him . Besides , the present ease and openness of manner might only result from security . Other circumstances combined , more than the captain imagined , in what is popularly called putting him out . He had always been hitherto on equal terms with Guy ; indeed , had rather the superiority at Hollywell , from his age and assumption of character , but here Sir Guy was somebody , the captain nobody , and even the advantage of age was lost , now that Guy was married and head of a family , while Philip was a stray young man and his guest . Far above such considerations as he thought himself , and deeming them only the tokens of the mammon worship of the time , Philip , nevertheless , did not like to be secondary to one to whom he had always been preferred ; and this , and perhaps the being half ashamed of it , made him something more approaching to cross than ever before ; but now and then , the persevering amiability of both would soften him , and restore him to his most gracious mood . He gave them their letters when they reached the nn , feeling as if he had a better right than they , to one which was in Laura 's writing , and when left in solitary possession of the sitting - room — a very pleasant one , with windows opening on the terrace just above the water — paced up and down , chafing at his own perplexity of feeling . Presently they came back ; Guy sat down to continue their joint journal - like letter to Charles , while Amabel made an orderly arrangement of their properties , making the most of their few books , and taking out her work as if she had been at home . Philip looked at the books . '
189958	189962	189954	189955	Childe Harold	462	' said he . '
189972	189973	189954	189955	Childe Harold	462	' '
189980	189981	189954	189955	Childe Harold	462	' '
190007	190008	190009	190009	I	0	' '
190015	190019	190009	190009	I	0	' said Guy . '

190042	190058	190022	190022	you	150	' he continued , feeling this reply inconsistent with his contempt for Guy 's youth , '
190075	190076	190077	190077	I	0	' '
190080	190090	190077	190077	I	0	' said Guy , looking up from his letter , '
190120	190121	190122	190122	I	0	' '
190128	190134	190125	190125	you	150	' said Amabel , thoughtfully . '
190140	190144	190125	190125	you	150	' said Philip . '
190159	190165	190148	190148	you	150	' he had almost added , '
190168	190169	190148	190148	you	150	' '
190191	190195	190188	190188	Byron	267	' said Guy . '
190210	190214	190215	190215	I	0	' said Philip . '
190244	190245	190188	190188	Byron	267	' '
190248	190318	190188	190188	Byron	267	' said Guy , though he little knew how much he owed to having attended to that caution ; for who could have told where the mastery might have been in the period of fearful conflict with his passions , if he had been feeding his imagination with the contemplation of revenge , dark hatred , and malice , and identifying himself with Byron 's brooding and lowering heroes ? '
190321	190325	190326	190326	I	0	' continued Philip , '
190350	190351	190352	190352	He	150	' '
190363	190367	190352	190352	He	150	' said Guy ; '
190399	190400	190390	190390	his	150	' '
190415	190416	190409	190409	You	150	' '
190422	190501	190409	190409	You	150	' said Guy,—'there is danger in listening to a man who is sure to misunderstand the voice of nature,—danger , lest by filling our ears with the wrong voice we should close them to the true one . I should think there was a great chance of being led to stop short at the material beauty , or worse , to link human passions with the glories of nature , and so distort , defile , profane them . '
190502	190516	190518	190518	Philip	454	' You have never read the poem , so you can not judge , '
190529	190548	190518	190518	Philip	454	' Your rule would exclude all descriptive poetry , unless it was written by angels , I suppose ? '
190549	190561	190409	190409	You	150	' No ; by men with minds in the right direction . '
190562	190570	190409	190409	You	150	' Very little you would leave us . '
190571	190578	190580	190580	Amabel	234	' I do n't think so , '
190582	190597	190580	190580	Amabel	234	' Almost all the poetry we really care about was written by such men . '
190598	190604	190409	190409	You	150	' Shakespeare , for instance ? '
190605	190625	190627	190627	Guy	150	' No one can doubt of the bent of his mind , from the whole strain of his writings , '
190629	190665	190627	190627	Guy	150	' So again with Spenser ; and as to Milton , though his religion was not quite the right sort , no one can pretend to say he had it not . Wordsworth , Scott — '
190666	190669	190671	190671	Philip	454	' Scott ? '
190673	190683	190685	190685	Amy	425	' Including the descriptions of scenery in his novels , '
190687	190702	190685	190685	Amy	425	' where , I am sure , there is the spirit and the beauty . '
190703	190713	190715	190715	Guy	150	' Or rather , the spirit is the beauty , '
190717	190728	190730	190730	Philip	454	' There is a good deal in what you say , '
190745	190776	190777	190777	Amabel	234	' but you will forgive me for thinking it rather too deep an explanation of the grounds of not making Childe Harold a handbook for Italy , like other people . '
190800	190816	190793	190793	Guy	150	' Rather so , considering that the fact was that we never thought of it . '
190993	191012	191014	191014	Philip	454	' People who looked no deeper than the surface would say , what a well - matched pair , '
191016	191035	191014	191014	Philip	454	' and no doubt they were very happy , poor young things , if it would but last . '
191199	191204	191205	191205	he	150	' Who ? Laura ! '
191223	191233	191205	191205	he	150	' You did not say she had been ill ? '
191234	191241	191243	191243	Amy	425	' No , she has not , '
191245	191281	191243	191243	Amy	425	' Dr. Mayerne said there was nothing really the matter ; but she has been worried and out of spirits lately ; and mamma thought it would be good for her to go out more . '
191497	191500	191544	191544	Philip	454	' shocking ; '
191510	191513	191544	191544	Philip	454	' intolerable ; '
191618	191658	191579	191579	his	150	' walks . Certain it is , that next morning he was not nearly so much inclined to be displeased with them for laughing , when , in speaking to Anne , he inadvertently called her mistress Miss Amabel . '
191662	191712	191579	191579	his	150	' said Amy , as Anne departed — and he looked disconcerted , as a precise man always does when catching himself in a mistake—'Anne is used to it ; Guy is always doing it , and puzzles poor Arnaud sorely by sending him for Miss Amabel 's parasol . '
191713	191719	191721	191721	Guy	150	' And the other day , '
191723	191745	191579	191579	his	150	' when Thorndale 's brother , at Munich , inquired after Lady Morville , I had to consider who she was . '
191746	191758	191579	191579	his	150	' Oh ! you saw Thorndale 's brother , did you ? '
191759	191802	191579	191579	his	150	' Yes ; he was very obliging . Guy had to go to him about our passports ; and when he found who we were , he brought his wife to call on us , and asked us to an evening party . '
191803	191808	191579	191579	his	150	' Did you go ? '
191809	191887	191579	191579	his	150	' Guy thought we must , and it was very entertaining . We had a curious adventure there . In the morning , we had been looking at those beautiful windows of the great church , when I turned round , and saw a gentleman — an Englishman — gazing with all his might at Guy . We met him again in the evening , and presently Mr. Thorndale came and told us it was Mr. Shene . '
191888	191894	191579	191579	his	150	' Shene , the painter ? '
191895	191937	191579	191579	his	150	' Yes . He had been very much struck with Guy 's face : it was exactly what he wanted for a picture he was about , and he wished of all things just to be allowed to make a sketch . '
191938	191943	191579	191579	his	150	' Did you submit ? '
191944	191947	191949	191949	Guy	150	' Yes , '
191951	191995	191949	191949	Guy	150	' and we were rewarded . I never saw a more agreeable person , or one who gave so entirely the impression of genius . The next day he took us through the gallery , and showed us all that was worth admiring . '
191996	192008	191579	191579	his	150	' And in what character is he to make you appear ? '
192009	192018	192020	192020	Amabel	234	' That is the strange part of it , '
192022	192104	192020	192020	Amabel	234	' Do n't you remember how Guy once puzzled us by choosing Sir Galahad for his favourite hero . It is that very Sir Galahad , when he kneels to adore the Saint Greal . Mr. Shene said he had long been dreaming over it , and at last , as he saw Guy 's face looking upwards , it struck him that it was just what he wanted : it would be worth anything to him to catch the expression . '
192105	192114	192116	192116	Guy	150	' I wonder what I was looking like ! '
192118	192131	192116	192116	Guy	150	' Did he take you as yourself , or as Sir Galahad ? '
192132	192138	192020	192020	Amabel	234	' As myself , happily . '
192139	192145	192020	192020	Amabel	234	' How did he succeed ? '
192146	192160	192116	192116	Guy	150	' Amy likes it ; but decidedly I should never have known myself . '
192161	192164	192166	192167	his wife	618	' Ah , '
192169	192188	192166	192167	his wife	618	' As far as the sun - burnt visage is concerned , the glass does that every morning . '
192189	192208	192210	192210	Amy	425	' Yes , but you do n't look at yourself exactly as you do at a painted window , '
192217	192229	192231	192231	Philip	454	' I can not think how you found time for sitting ! '
192233	192272	192274	192274	Amy	425	' O , it is quite a little thing , a mere sketch , done in two evenings and half an hour in the morning . He promises it to me when he has done with Sir Galahad , '
192276	192292	192274	192274	Amy	425	' Two — three evenings . You must have been a long time at Munich . '
192293	192297	192299	192299	Guy	150	' A fortnight , '
192301	192311	192299	192299	Guy	150	' there is a great deal to see there . '
192605	192608	192592	192592	they	7534	' somewhere . '
192816	192830	192801	192801	Philip	454	' You do n't think there is any cause for anxiety about Laura ? '
192831	192837	192839	192839	Amy	425	' No ; certainly not ! '
192843	192877	192839	192839	Amy	425	' She has not been looking well lately , but Dr. Mayerne says it is nothing , and you know'—she blushed and looked down—'there were many things to make this a trying time . '
192878	192892	192801	192801	Philip	454	' Is she quite strong ? Can she do as much as usual ? '
192893	192964	192965	192965	Philip	454	' She does more than ever : mamma is only afraid of her overworking herself , but she never allows that she is tired . She goes to school three days in the week , besides walking to East Hill on Thursday to help in the singing ; and she is getting dreadfully learned . Guy gave her his old mathematical books , and Charlie always calls her Miss Parabola . '
193032	193043	193028	193028	he	3641	' I am afraid we must give up our plan . '
193044	193047	193050	193050	Philip	454	' How ? '
193054	193086	193050	193050	Philip	454	' I have just heard that there is a fever at Sondrio , and all that neighbourhood , and everyone says it would be very foolish to expose ourselves to it . '
193087	193094	193096	193096	Amy	425	' What shall we do instead ? '
193098	193118	193096	193096	Amy	425	' I told Arnaud we would let him know in an hour 's time ; I thought of Venice . '
193119	193128	193050	193050	Philip	454	' Venice , oh ! yes , delightful . '
193129	193137	193139	193139	Guy	150	' What do you say , Philip ? '
193141	193188	193139	193139	Guy	150	' I say that I can not see any occasion for our being frightened out of our original determination . If a fever prevails among the half - starved peasantry , it need not affect well - fed healthy persons , merely passing through the country . '
193189	193200	193202	193202	Guy	150	' You see we could hardly manage without sleeping there , '
193204	193280	193202	193202	Guy	150	' we must sleep either at Colico , or at Madonna . Now Colico , they say , is a most unhealthy place at this time of year , and Madonna is the very heart of the fever — Sondrio not much better . I do n't see how it is to be safely done ; and though very likely we might not catch the fever , I do n't see any use in trying . '
193281	193294	193139	193139	Guy	150	' That is making yourself a slave to the fear of infection . '
193295	193310	193312	193312	Guy	150	' I do n't know what purpose would be answered by running the risk , '
193314	193329	193331	193331	Philip	454	' If you choose to give it so dignified a name as a risk , '
193333	193340	193342	193342	Guy	150	' I do n't , then , '
193346	193385	193342	193342	Guy	150	' I should not care if there was any reason for going there ; but as there is not , I shall face Mrs. Edmonstone better if I do n't run Amy into any more chances of mischief . '
193386	193394	193396	193396	Philip	454	' Is Amy grateful for the care ? '
193398	193408	193396	193396	Philip	454	' after all her wishes for the eastern bank ? '
193409	193416	193418	193418	Guy	150	' Amy is a good wife , '
193420	193443	193418	193418	Guy	150	' For Venice , then . I 'll ring for Arnaud . You will come with us , wo nt you Philip ? '
193444	193476	193488	193488	Amy	425	' No , I thank you ; I always intended to see the Valtelline , and an epidemic among the peasantry does not seem to me to be sufficient to deter . '
193477	193486	193488	193488	Amy	425	' O Philip , you surely will not ? '
193490	193502	193488	193488	Amy	425	' My mind is made up , Amy , thank you . '
193503	193511	193513	193513	Guy	150	' I wish you would be persuaded , '
193515	193538	193513	193513	Guy	150	' I should like particularly to have you to lionize us there ; and I do n't fancy your running into danger . '
193985	194023	193979	193979	Philip	454	' reflection , spoke in the half - compassionate , half - patronizing manner with which he used , now and then , to let fall a few crumbs of counsel or commendation for silly little Amy . '
194049	194098	194099	194099	I	0	' He got no further in his intended warning against the dissipations of Venice , for her eyes were fixed on him at first with a look of extreme wonder . Then her face assumed an expression of dignity , and gently , but gravely , she said , '
194109	194117	194101	194101	you	425	' The gentlemanlike instinct made him reply , '
194225	194396	194221	194221	she	234	' One thing I wish to say , because we shall never speak on this subject again , and I was always afraid of you before . You have always misunderstood him ; I might almost say , chosen to misunderstand him . You have tried his temper more than any one , and never appreciated the struggles that have subdued it . It is not because I am his wife that I say this — indeed I am not sure it becomes me to say it ; yet I can not bear that you should not be told of it , because you think he acts out of enmity to you . You little know how your friendship has been his first desire — how he has striven for it — how , after all you have done and written , he defended you with all his might when those at home were angry — how he sought you out on purpose to try to be real cordial friends . '
194410	194417	194397	194397	Philip	454	' those at home were angry . '
194418	194428	194430	194430	he	454	' It is not I that prevent that friendship , '
194432	194447	194430	194430	he	454	' it is his own want of openness . My opinion has never changed . '
194448	194458	194460	194460	Amy	425	' No ; I know it has never changed , '
194469	194485	194460	194460	Amy	425	' Whenever it does , you will be sorry you have judged him so harshly . '
194661	194666	194668	194668	Guy	150	' Come , Philip , '
194675	194694	194668	194668	Guy	150	' I wish you would think better of it after all , and come with us to Milan . '
194695	194705	194635	194635	she	425	' Thank you , my mind is made up . '
194706	194728	194668	194668	Guy	150	' Well , mind you do n't catch the fever : for I do n't want the trouble of nursing you . '
194729	194744	194746	194746	Philip	454	' Thank you ; I hope to require no such services of my friends , '
194756	194763	194746	194746	Philip	454	' I do n't want you . '
194764	194770	194772	194772	Guy	150	' Good bye , then , '
194784	194816	194781	194781	he	150	' I wish we could have seen more of you . They will be glad to hear of you at Hollywell . You have had one warm friend there all along . '
194837	194846	194847	194847	he	150	' Remember me to them when you write , '
194850	194878	194847	194847	he	150	' and tell Laura she must not wear herself out with her studies . Good bye , Amy ; I hope you will have a pleasant journey . '
194889	194894	194896	194896	Philip	454	' Poor little Amy ! '
194900	194993	194896	194896	Philip	454	' how she is improved . He has a sweet little wife in her . The fates have conspired to crown him with all man can desire , and little marvel if he should abuse his advantages . Poor little Amy ! I have less hope than ever , since even her evident wishes could not bend his determination in this trifle ; but she is a good little creature , happy in her blindness . May it long continue ! It is my uncle and aunt who are to be blamed . '
195039	195044	195046	195046	Amy	425	' Just like himself , '
195062	195068	195070	195070	she	425	' Are you much vexed ? '
195072	195088	195070	195070	she	425	' I do n't feel as if I had made the most of my opportunities . '
195089	195121	195046	195046	Amy	425	' Then if you have not , I can tell you who has . What do you think of his beginning to give me a lecture how to behave to you ? '
195122	195132	195183	195183	he	150	' Did he think you wanted it very much ? '
195133	195150	195151	195151	Guy	150	' I do n't know : for of course I could not let him go on . '
195199	195219	195183	195183	he	150	' Now , Guido — good Cavaliere Guido — do grant me one satisfaction , said she , coaxingly . '
195233	195234	195222	195222	you	150	' '
195251	195260	195239	195239	I	0	' said Guy , pretending to be provoking . '
195288	195340	195279	195279	he	150	' Guy smiled , and began to whistle — Wordsworth . It was about three weeks after the rendezvous at Bellagio , that Sir Guy and Lady Morville arrived at Vicenza , on their way from Venice . They were in the midst of breakfast when Arnaud entered , saying , — '
195361	195362	195358	195359	Captain Morville	275	' '
195372	195373	195377	195377	his	150	' '
195401	195402	195390	195394	an Englishman of your name	3657	' '
195405	195406	195390	195394	an Englishman of your name	3657	' '
195459	195460	195461	195461	I	0	' '
195468	195529	195461	195461	I	0	' said Guy , rising in haste . Returning in a quarter of hour , he said,—'It is true . It can be no other than poor Philip . I have seen his doctor , an Italian , who , when he saw our name written , said it was the same . He calls it una febbre molto grave . '
195530	195543	195461	195461	I	0	' Very heavy ! Did he only know the name in writing ? '
195544	195562	195461	195461	I	0	' Only from seeing it on his passport . He has been unable to give any directions . '
195563	195593	195595	195595	Amabel	234	' How dreadfully ill he must be ! And alone ! What shall we do ? You wo nt think of leaving me behind you , whatever you do ? '
195599	195609	195595	195595	Amabel	234	' It is at no great distance , and — '
195610	195646	195647	195647	Her	3662	' O , do n't say that . Only take me with you . I will try to bear it , if you do n't think it right ; but it will be very hard ! '
195672	195677	195679	195679	he	3663	' My poor Amy ! '
195683	195701	195679	195679	he	3663	' I believe the anxiety would be worse for you if I were to leave you here . '
195702	195708	195710	195710	she	3662	' Oh , thank you ! '
195712	195740	195710	195710	she	3662	' You will have nothing to do with the nursing . No , I do n't think there is much risk ; so we will go together . '
195741	195763	195679	195679	he	3663	' Thank you ! thank you ! and perhaps I may be of some use . But is it very infectious ? '
195764	195847	195848	195848	They	3664	' I hope not : caught at Colico , and imported to a fresh place , I should think there was little fear of its spreading . However , we must soon be off : I am afraid he is very ill , and almost deserted . In the first place , I had better send an express to the Consul at Venice , to ask him to recommend us a doctor , for I have not much faith in this Italian . '
196091	196101	196103	196103	he	150	' We must find another room for him directly , '
196105	196140	196103	196103	he	150	' He can not possibly exist where he is — a little den — such an atmosphere of fever — enough to knock one down ! Will you have one got ready for him ? '
196141	196144	196146	196146	Amabel	234	' Directly , '
196150	196155	196146	196146	Amabel	234	' How is he ? '
196156	196232	196233	196233	Arnaud	186	' He is in a stupor : it is not sleep . He is frightfully ill . I never felt anything like the heat of his skin . But that stifling hole would account for much ; very likely he may revive , when we get him into a better atmosphere . No one has attended to him properly . It is a terrible thing to be ill in a foreign country without a friend ! '
196610	196614	196617	196617	he	3680	' Da bere , '
196646	196650	196652	196652	Guy	150	' Some water ? '
196685	196698	196668	196668	his	454	' Is that enough ? Do you like some on your forehead ? '
196699	196703	196666	196666	Philip	454	' Thank you . '
196704	196720	196721	196721	He	150	' Is that more comfortable ? We only heard to - day you were ill . '
197067	197069	197075	197075	his	150	' Home '
197078	197085	197075	197075	his	150	' I would not go home , '
197876	197880	197871	197871	he	150	' How many ? '
197891	197897	197871	197871	he	150	' I can not count , '
197901	197914	197871	197871	he	150	' but it is less than in the evening . Some drink ? '
197929	197935	197991	197991	he	150	' What day is it ? '
197936	197945	197991	197991	he	150	' Saturday morning , the 23rd of August . '
197946	197955	197991	197991	he	150	' I have been ill a long time ! '
197956	197973	197974	197974	He	150	' You have indeed , full three weeks ; but you are better to - night . '
198004	198021	197991	197991	he	150	' I suppose , humanly speaking , it is an even chance between life and death ? '

198146	198168	198120	198120	Guy	150	' said Guy , with a rush of joy at hearing the words of reconciliation he had yearned for so long . '
198191	198230	198185	198185	I	0	' and he feebly moved his hand to his cousin , who pressed it , hardly less happy than on the day he stood before Mrs. Edmonstone in the dressing - room . Presently , Philip went on . '
198251	198273	198274	198274	You	150	' His voice suddenly failed ; and while Guy was again moistening his lips , he gathered strength , and said , '

198375	198398	198372	198373	Poor Laura	454	' again said Philip , in a much weaker voice , and after lying still a little longer , he faintly whispered . '
198403	198430	198431	198431	Amy	425	' Guy read till he fell into a doze , which lasted till Arnaud came in the morning , and Guy went up to his wife . '

198463	198477	198445	198445	he	3722	' said Amabel , answering his look with one as calm and sweet . '

198938	198951	198932	198933	good Lord	3733	' Amabel was silent , and presently he sat down , saying . '

198966	198970	198971	198971	Laura	454	' said Amy . '
198980	198999	198975	198975	she	3734	' And as Guy smiled at the recollection of their own simultaneous coming to mamma , she added , '
199014	199015	198975	198975	she	3734	' '
199046	199047	199035	199035	she	3734	' '
199051	199055	199035	199035	she	3734	' said Amy . '
199058	199067	199035	199035	she	3734	' She paused , and Guy presently said , '
199124	199335	199116	199116	Arnaud	186	' Amabel sat long over the remains of her breakfast . She did not puzzle herself over Philip 's confession , for she would not admit it without confirmation ; and she could not think of his misdoings , even those of which she was certain , on the day when his life was hanging in the balance . All she could bear to recollect was his excellence ; nay , in the tenderness of her heart , she nearly made out that she had always been very fond of him , overlooking that even before Guy came to Hollywell , she had always regarded him with more awe than liking , been disinclined to his good advice , shrunk from his condescension , and regularly enjoyed Charles 's quizzing of him . All this , and all the subsequent injuries were forgotten , and she believed , as sincerely as her husband , that Philip had been free from any unkind intention . But she chiefly dwelt on her own Guy , especially that last speech , so unlike some of whom she had heard , who were rather glad to find a flaw in a faultless model , if only to obtain a fellow - feeling for it . '
199338	199342	199116	199116	Arnaud	186	' thought she , '
199455	199749	199444	199444	I	0	' She set to work on her housewifely cares ; but when these were despatched , it was hard to begin anything else on such a day of suspense , when she was living on reports from the sick - room . The delirium had returned , more violent than ever ; and as she sat at her open window , she often heard the disconnected , words . She could do nothing but listen — she could neither read nor draw , and even letter - writing failed her to - day , for it seemed cruel to send a letter to his sister , and if Philip was not under a delusion , it was still worse to write to Hollywell ; it made her shudder to think of the misery she might have inflicted in the former letters , where she had not spared the detail of her worst fears and conjectures , and by no means softened the account , as she had done to his sister . Late in the afternoon the physician came , and she heard of his being quieter ; indeed , there were no sounds below . It grew dark , Arnaud brought lights , and told her , Captain Morville had sunk into stupor . After another long space , the doctor came to take some coffee , and said the fever was lessening , but that strength was going with it , and if le malade was saved , it would be owing to the care and attention of le chevalier . Of Guy she saw no more that evening . The last bulletin was pencilled by him on a strip of paper , and sent to her at eleven at night : '
199784	199950	199951	199951	Guy	150	' Amy submitted , and slowly put herself to bed , because she thought Guy would not like to find her up ; but she had little sleep , and that was dreamy , full of the same anxieties as her waking moments , and perhaps making the night seem longer than if she had been awake the whole time . At last she started from a somewhat sounder doze than usual , and saw it was becoming light ; the white summits of the mountains were beginning to show themselves , and there was twilight in the room . Just then she heard a light , cautious tread in the passage ; the lock of Guy 's dressing - room was gently , slowly turned . It was over , then ! Life or death ? Her heart beat as she heard her husband 's step in the next room , and her suspense would let her call out nothing but—'I am not asleep ! '
199985	199991	199978	199978	he	150	' He 'll do now ! '
200034	200042	200044	200044	Guy	150	' He is asleep quietly and comfortably , '
200048	200127	200044	200044	Guy	150	' and his pulse is steadier . The faintness and sinking have been dreadful ; the doctor has been sitting with his hand on his pulse , telling me when to put the cordial into his mouth . Twice I thought him all but gone ; and , till within the last hour , I did not think he could have revived ; but now , the doctor says , we may almost consider the danger as over . '
200128	200144	200017	200017	he	150	' Oh , how glad I am ! Was he sensible ? Could he speak ? '
200145	200193	200044	200044	Guy	150	' Sensible , at least when not fainting ; but too weak to speak , or often to look up . When he did , though , it was very kindly , very pleasantly . And now ! This is joy coming in the morning , Amy ! '
200194	200207	200209	200209	Amy	425	' I wonder if you are happier now than after the shipwreck , '
200215	200328	200209	200209	Amy	425	' How can you ask ? The shipwreck was a gleam , the first ray that came to cheer me in those penance hours , when I was cut off from all ; and now , oh Amy ! I can not enter into it . Such richness and fulness of blessing showered on me , more than I ever dared to wish for or dream of , both in the present and future hopes . It seems more than can belong to man , at least to me , so unlike what I have deserved , that I can hardly believe it . It must be sent as a great trial . '
200727	200734	200713	200713	Philip	454	' Are you writing to Hollywell ? '
200735	200761	200786	200786	he	150	' Yes , to Charlotte ; but there is no hurry , it wo nt go till to - morrow . Have you any message ? '
200762	200768	200771	200771	he	150	' No , thank you . '
200789	200799	200786	200786	he	150	' Guy , have I said anything about Laura ? '
200800	200803	200805	200805	Guy	150	' Yes , '
200812	200823	200825	200825	Philip	454	' I thought so ; but I could not remember , '
200843	200857	200786	200786	he	150	' I hope it was not when I had no command of myself . '
200858	200893	200960	200960	His	454	' No , you were seldom intelligible ; you were generally trying to speak Italian , or else talking about Stylehurst . The only time you mentioned her was the night before the worst . '
200894	200898	200900	200900	Philip	454	' I recollect , '
200902	200959	200900	200900	Philip	454	' I will not draw back from the resolution I then made , though I did not know whether I had spoken it , let the consequences be what they may . The worst is , that they will fall the most severely on her ; and her implicit reliance on me was her only error . '
201024	201029	201031	201031	Philip	454	' I must explain , '
201033	201220	201221	201221	he	3746	' that you may see how little blame can be imputed to her . It was that summer , three years ago , the first after you came . I had always been her chief friend . I saw , or thought I saw cause for putting her on her guard . The result has shown that the danger was imaginary ; but no matter — I thought it real . In the course of the conversation , more of my true sentiments were avowed than I was aware of ; she was very young , and before we , either of us , knew what we were doing , it had been equivalent to a declaration . Well ! I do not speak to excuse the concealment , but to show you my motive . If it had been known , there would have been great displeasure and disturbance , I should have been banished ; and though time might have softened matters we should both have had a great deal to go through . Heaven knows what it may be now ! And Guy , '
201230	201251	201221	201221	he	3746	' when did you hear from Hollywell ? Do you know how she has borne the news of my illness ? '
201252	201262	201264	201264	Guy	150	' We have heard since they knew of it , '
201266	201283	201264	201264	Guy	150	' the letter was from Mrs. Edmonstone to Amy , but she did not mention Laura . '
201284	201320	201221	201221	he	3746	' She has great strength ; she would endure anything rather than give way ; but how can she have borne the anxiety and silence ? You are sure my aunt does not mention her ? '
201321	201336	201264	201264	Guy	150	' Certain . I will ask Amy for the letter , if you like . '
201442	201443	201453	201453	she	3748	' '

201786	201805	201756	201756	You	0	' said Guy , perceiving how Philip 's bodily weakness was making him fall into a desponding strain . '
201866	201893	201859	201859	you	0	' Philip in was a state of feebleness that made him willing to avoid the trouble of thinking , by simply believing what he was told , '
201901	202120	202121	202121	Amy	425	' He was relieved by having confessed , though to the person whom , a few weeks back , he would have thought the last to whom he could have made such a communication , over whom he had striven to assume superiority , and therefore before whom he could have least borne to humble himself — nay , whose own love he had lately traversed with an arrogance that was rendered positively absurd by this conduct of his own . Nevertheless , he had not shrunk from the confession . His had been real repentance , so far as he perceived his faults ; and he would have scorned to avail himself of the certainty of Guy 's silence on what he had said at the time of his extreme danger . He had resolved to speak , and had found neither an accuser nor a judge , not even one consciously returning good for evil , but a friend with honest , simple , straightforward kindness , doing the best for him in his power , and dreading nothing so much as hurting his feelings . It was not the way in which Philip himself could have received such a confidence . As soon as Guy could leave him , he went up to his wife . '
202123	202130	202121	202121	Amy	425	' said he , rather sadly , '
202142	202149	202193	202193	he	156	' Her first exclamation surprised him : '

202280	202294	202254	202254	he	156	' exclaimed Amabel , as if she heard it for the first time . '
202338	202352	202353	202353	I	0	' Guy told what he had just heard , and she was indignant . '

202863	202960	202860	202860	you	0	' They walked for some time , talking over the conduct of Philip and Laura . Amabel seemed quite oppressed by the thought of such a burthen of concealment . She said she did not know what she should have done in her own troubles without mamma and Charlie ; and she could not imagine Laura 's keeping silence through the time of Philip 's danger ; more especially as she recollected how appalling some of her bulletins had been . The only satisfaction was in casting as much of the blame on him as possible . '
202987	202988	202979	202979	she	3768	' '
202999	203005	202989	202989	I	0	' said Guy , laughing , '

203160	203341	203098	203098	he	3770	' They tried to recollect all that had passed during that summer , and to guess against whom he had wished to warn her ; but so far were they from divining the truth , that they agreed it must either have been Maurice , or some other wild Irishman . Next , they considered what was to be done . Philip must manage his confession his own way ; but they had it in their power greatly to soften matters ; and there was no fear that , after the first shock , Mr. Edmonstone would insist on the engagement being broken off . Philip should come to recover his health at Redclyffe , where he would be ready to meet the first advance towards forgiveness,—and Amabel thought it would soon be made . Papa 's anger was sharp , but soon over ; he was very fond of Philip , and delighted in a love affair ; but she was afraid mamma would not get over it so soon , for she would be excessively hurt and grieved . '
203348	203352	203098	203098	he	3770	' said Amy , '
203364	203867	203360	203360	mamma	5168	' Guy launched out into more schemes for facilitating their marriage than ever he had made for himself ; and the walk ended with extensive castle building on Philip 's account , in the course of which Amy was obliged to become much less displeased . Guy told her , in the evening , that she would have been still more softened if she could have heard him talk about Stylehurst and his father . Guy had always wished to hear him speak of the Archdeacon , though they had never been on terms to enter on such a subject . And now Philip had been much pleased by Guy 's account of his walks to Stylehurst , and taken pleasure in telling which were his old haunts , making out where Guy had been , and describing his father 's ways . The next day was Sunday , and Amabel was to pay her cousin a visit . Guy was very eager about it , saying it was like a stage in his recovery ; and though the thought of her mother and Laura could not be laid aside , she would not say a word to damp her husband 's pleasure in the anticipation . It seemed as if Guy , wanting to bestow all he could upon his cousin in gratitude for his newly accorded friendship , thought the sight of his little wife the very best thing he had to give . It was a beautiful day , early in September , with a little autumnal freshness in the mountain breezes that they enjoyed exceedingly . Philip 's convalescence , and their own escape , might be considered as so far decided , that they might look back on the peril as past . Amabel felt how much cause there was for thankfulness ; and , after all , Philip was not half as bad now as when he was maintaining his system of concealment ; he had made a great effort , and was about to do his best by way of reparation ; but it was so new to her to pity him , that she did not know how to begin . She tried to make the day seem as Sunday like as she could , by putting on her white muslin dress and white ribbons , with Charles 's hair bracelet , and a brooch of beautiful silver workmanship , which Guy had bought for her at Milan , the only ornament he had ever given to her . She sat at her window , watching the groups of Italians in their holiday costume , and dwelling on the strange thoughts that had passed through her mind often before in her lonely Sundays in this foreign land , thinking much of her old home and Easthill Church , wondering whether the letter had yet arrived which was to free them from anxiety , and losing herself in a maze of uncomfortable marvels about Laura . '
203872	203880	203360	203360	mamma	5168	' at length said Guy , entering , '
203923	203937	203919	203921	Dame Amabel Morville	234	' He led her down , opened the door , and playfully announced , '
203953	204120	203950	203950	she	234	' She had of course expected to see Philip much altered , but she was startled by the extent of the change ; for being naturally fair and high - coloured , he was a person on whom the traces of illness were particularly visible . The colour was totally gone , even from his lips ; his cheeks were sunken , his brow looked broader and more massive from the thinness of his face and the loss of his hair , and his eyes themselves appeared unlike what they used to be in the hollows round them . He seemed tranquil , and comfortable , but so wan , weak , and subdued , and so different from himself , that she was very much shocked ; as smiling and holding out a hand , where the white skin seemed hardly to cover the bone and blue vein , he said , in a tone , slow , feeble , and languid , though cheerful , '

204159	204183	204134	204134	I	0	' said Amabel , laughing , because she was almost ready to cry , and her displeasure went straight out of her head . '
204195	204215	204185	204185	you	0	' said Philip , raising his head from the pillow , with a becoming shade of his ceremonious courtesy . '
204221	204275	204185	204185	you	0	' Amy smiled and thanked him , while he lay gazing at her as a sick person is apt to do at a flower , or the first pretty enlivening object from which he is able to derive enjoyment ; and as if he could not help expressing the feeling , he said — '

204383	204389	204353	204354	a bride	3324	' said Amy , smiling . '

204434	204465	204420	204420	you	3780	' said Amy , and Guy was much pleased to hear her taking a voluntary share in the invitation , knowing as he did that she only half liked it . '
204473	204477	204469	204469	we	3782	' replied Philip . '
204527	204556	204519	204519	you	425	' finished Guy , with an air of triumph , that was rather amusing , considering what a pale skeleton face he was regarding with so much satisfaction . '
204565	204569	204519	204519	you	425	' said Amy ; '

204926	204936	204938	204938	Philip	454	' I went on according to my former plan , '
204940	204995	204938	204938	Philip	454	' walking through the Valtelline , and coming down by a mountain path . I was not well at Bolzano , but I thought it only fatigue , which a Sunday 's rest would remove , so on I went for the next two days , in spite of pain in head and limbs . '
204996	205000	205002	205002	Amy	425	' Not walking ? '
205004	205193	205002	205002	Amy	425	' Yes , walking . I thought it was stiffness from mountain climbing , and that I could walk it off ; but I never wish to go through anything like what I did the last day , between the ups and downs of that mountain path , and the dazzle of the snow , and heat of the sun . I meant to have reached Vicenza , but I must have been quite knocked up when I arrived here , though I can not tell . My head grew so confused , that my dread , all the way , was that I should forget my Italian ; I can just remember conning a phrase over and over again , lest I should lose it . I suppose I was able to speak when I came here ; but the last thing I remember was feeling very ill in some room , different from this , quite alone , and with a horror of dying deserted . The next is a confused recollection of the relief of hearing English again , and seeing my excellent nurse here . '

There were a few pale flashes of lightning in the mountains , and at the words '
206154	206167	206148	206149	the Lord	3803	' a low but solemn peal of thunder came as an accompaniment . '
206179	206208	206148	206149	the Lord	3803	' The full sweet melody died away , but the echo caught it up and answered like the chant of a spirit in the distance—'The blessing of peace . '

206927	207056	206917	206917	I	0	' As he lay still , she had the comfort of seeing him somewhat revived , but he listened to her persuasions not to attempt to move . It was later than she had expected , and she found that breakfast was laid out in the next room . She brought him some tea ; but he did not seem inclined to lift his head to drink it ; and begged her to go at once to Philip , fearing he must be thinking himself strangely forgotten , and giving her many directions about the way he liked to be waited on at breakfast . Very much surprised was Philip to see her instead of her husband , and greatly concerned to hear that Guy was not well . '
207061	207065	206917	206917	I	0	' said he . '
207080	207111	207066	207066	He	3818	' Then , after an interval , during which he had begun breakfast , with many apologies for letting her wait on him , he said , with some breaks , '
207148	207149	207136	207136	You	425	' '
207162	207323	207324	207324	Amy	425	' said Amabel , moved by the trembling of his feeble voice , but too anxious to return to her husband to like to wait even to hear that Philip 's opinion had altered . It required much self - command not to hurry , even by manner , her cousin 's tardy , languid movements ; but she had been well trained by Charles in waiting on sick breakfasts . When at length she was able to escape , she found that Guy had undressed , and gone to bed again . He said he was more comfortable , and desired her to go and take her own breakfast before coming back to him , and she obeyed as well as she could , but very soon was again with him . He looked flushed and oppressed , and when she put her cool hand across his forehead , she was frightened at the increased throbbing of his temples . '
207326	207335	207324	207324	Amy	425	' said he , looking steadily at her , '
207341	207863	207324	207324	Amy	425	' Without answering she drew his hand into hers , and felt his pulse , which did indeed plainly respond fever . Each knew that the other was recollecting what he had said , on Sunday , of the doctor 's prediction , and Amy knew he was thinking of death ; but all that passed was a proposal to send at once for the French physician . Amabel wrote her note with steadiness , derived from the very force of the shock . She could not think , she did not know whether she feared or hoped . To act from one moment to another was all she attempted , and it was well that her imagination did not open to be appalled at her own situation , so young , alone with the charge of two sick men in a foreign country ; her cousin , indeed , recovering , but helpless , and not even in a state to afford her counsel ; her husband sickening for this frightful fever , and with more than ordinary cause for apprehension , even without the doctor 's prophecy , when she thought of his slight frame , and excitable temperament , and that though never as yet tried by a day 's illness , he certainly had more spirit than strength , while all the fatigue he had been undergoing was likely to tell upon him now . She did not look forward , she did not look round ; she did not hope or fear , she trusted , and did her best for each , as she was wanted , trying not to make herself useless to both , by showing that she wished to be in two places at once . It was a day sufficiently distressing in itself had there been no further apprehension , for there was the restlessness of illness , working on a character too active and energetic to acquiesce without a trial in the certainty that there was no remedy for present discomfort . There was no impatience nor rebellion against the illness itself , but a wish to try one after another the things that had been effective in relieving Philip during his recovery . At the same time , he could not bear that Amabel should do anything to tire herself , and was very anxious that Philip should not be neglected . He tossed from one side to the other in burning oppression or cold chills ; Amy saw him looking wistful , suggested something by way of alleviation , then found he had been wishing for it , but refraining from asking in order to spare her , and that he was sorry when she procured it . Again and again this happened ; she smoothed the coverings , and shook up the pillow ; he would thank her , look at her anxiously , beg her not to exert herself , but soon grow restless , and the whole was repeated . At last , as she was trying to arrange the coverings , he exclaimed , — '
207884	207987	207876	207876	I	0	' and as he made the resolution he smiled at treating himself so like a child . His power of self - restraint came to his aid , and long before the hour was over he had fallen asleep . This was a relief ; yet that oppressed , flushed , discomposed slumber , and heavy breathings , only confirmed her fears that the fever had gained full possession of him . She had not the heart to write such tidings , at least till the physician should have made them too certain , nor could she even bear to use the word '
207989	208158	207876	207876	I	0	' in her answers to the anxious inquiries Philip made whenever she went into his room , though when he averted his face with a heavy sigh , she knew his conclusion was the same as her own . The opinion of the physician was the only thing wanting to bring home the certainty , and that fell on her like lead in the evening , with one comfort , however , that he thought it a less severe case than the former one . It was a great relief , too , that there was no wandering of mind , only the extreme drowsiness and oppression , and when Guy was roused by the doctor 's visit , he was as clear and collected as possible , making inquiries and remarks , and speaking in a particularly calm and quiet manner . As soon as the doctor was gone , he looked up to Amabel , saying , with his own smile , only very dim , — '
208203	208204	208184	208185	The doctor	5336	' '
208210	208214	208227	208227	you	3820	' said Amy . '
208235	208236	208227	208227	you	3820	' '
208249	208262	208242	208242	you	3820	' said she , with a sad submissiveness . He smiled again . '
208270	208279	208263	208263	I	0	' he said , looking tenderly at her . '
208316	208450	208303	208303	you	0	' Sadness in his eye , a sweet smile on his lip , and serenity on his brow , joined with the fevered cheek , the air of lassitude , and the panting , oppressed breath , there was a strange , melancholy beauty about him , and while Amy felt an impulse of ardent , clinging affection to one so precious to her , there was joined with it a sort of awe and veneration for one who so spoke , looked , and felt . She hung over him , and sprinkled him with eau - de - Cologne ; then as his hair teazed him by falling into his eyes , he asked her to cut the front lock off . There was something sad in doing this , for that '
208456	209139	208303	208303	you	0	' as Charlotte called it , was rather a favourite of Amy 's ; it always seemed to have so much sympathy with his moods , and it was as if parting with it was resigning him to a long illness . However , it was too troublesome not to go , and he looked amused at the care with which she folded up the glossy , brown wave , and treasured it in her dressing - case , then she read to him a few verses of a psalm , and he soon fell into another doze . There was little more of event , day after day . The fever never ran as high as in Philip 's case , and there was no delirium . There was almost constant torpor , but when for any short space he was thoroughly awakened , his mind was perfectly clear , though he spoke little , and then only on the subject immediately presented to him . There he lay for one quiet hour after another , while Amy sat by him , with as little consciousness of time as he had himself , looking neither forward nor backward , only to the present , to give him drink , bathe his face and hands , arrange his pillows , or read or repeat some soothing verse . It always was a surprise when meal - times summoned her to attend to Philip , when she was asked for the letters for the post , when evening twilight gathered in , or when she had to leave the night - watch to Arnaud , and go to bed in the adjoining room . This was a great trial , but he would not allow her to sit up , and her own sense showed her that if this was to be a long illness , it would not do to waste her strength . She knew he was quiet at night , and her trustful temper so calmed and supported her , that she was able to sleep , and thus was not as liable to be over - worked as might have been feared , and as Philip thought she must be . She always appeared in his room with her sweet face mournful and anxious , but never ruffled , or with any air of haste or discomposure , desirous as she was to return to her husband , for , though he frequently sent her to take care of herself or of Philip , she knew that while she was away he always grew more restless and uncomfortable , and his look of relief at her re - entrance said as much to her as a hundred complaints of her absence would have done . Philip was in the mean time sorely tried by being forced to be entirely inactive and dependent , while he saw Amabel in such need of assistance ; and so far from being able to requite Guy 's care , he could only look on himself as the cause of their distress , and an addition to it , a burthen instead of a help . If he had been told a little while ago what would be the present state of things , he would almost have laughed the speaker to scorn . He would have thought a child as competent as Amy to the sole management of two sick persons , and he not able either to advise or cheer her . Yet he could not see anything went wrong that depended on her . His comforts were so cared for that he was often sorry she should have troubled herself about them ; and though he could have little of her company , he never was allowed to feel himself deserted . Anne , Arnaud , the old Italian nurse , or Amy herself , were easily summoned , and gave him full care and attention . He was , however , necessarily a good deal alone ; and though his cousins '

209817	209847	209807	209807	Amy	425	' You will be better now it is off your mind . But how tired you are . You must go back to bed . Shall I call Arnaud ? '
209848	209928	209767	209767	she	425	' I must rest first'—and his voice failing , he laid back on the sofa , closed his eyes , turned ashy pale , and became so faint that she could not leave him , and was obliged to apply every restorative within reach , before she could bring him back to a state of tolerable comfort . The next minute her work was nearly undone , when Anne came in to ask for the letters for the post . '
209934	210077	209930	209930	I	0	' asked Amy . He muttered an assent . But when she looked back to him after speaking to Anne , she saw a tremulous , almost convulsed working of the closed eyes and mouth , while the thin hands were clenched together with a force contrasting with the helpless manner in which they had hung a moment before . She guessed at the intensity of anguish it must cost a temper so proud , a heart of so strong a mould , and feelings so deep , to take the first irrevocable step in self - humiliation , giving up into the hands of others the engagement that had hitherto been the cherished treasure of his life ; and above all , in exposing Laura to bear the brunt of the penalty of the fault into which he had led her .

It was a treat indeed to have him able to consult with her once more , and he looked so much relieved and so much better , that she felt as if it was the beginning of real improvement , though still his pulse was fast , and the fever , though lessened , was not gone . The letter was almost as much his as her own , and he ended his dictation thus : '

210796	211304	211394	211394	she	159	' Laura 's voice alone was unheard in the chorus of inquiry . She sat cold , stiff , and silent , devouring with her ears each reply , that fell like a death - blow , while she was mechanically continuing the occupations of breakfast . When all was told , she hurried to her own room , but the want of sympathy was becoming intolerable . If Amabel had been at home , she must have told her all . There was no one else ; and the misery to be endured in silence was dreadful . Her dearest — her whole joy and hope — suffering , dying , and to hear all round her speaking of him with kindness , indeed , but what to her seemed indifference ; blaming him for wilfulness , saying he had drawn it on himself,—it seemed to drive her wild . She conjured up pictures of his suffering , and dreaded Guy 's inexperience , the want of medical advice , imagining everything that was terrible . Her idol , to whom her whole soul was devoted , was passing from her , and no one pitied her ; while the latent consciousness of disobedience debarred her from gaining solace from the only true source . All was blank desolation — a wild agony , untempered by resignation , uncheered by prayer ; for though she did pray , it was without trust , without hope , while her wretchedness was rendered more overwhelming by her efforts to conceal it . These were so far ineffectual that no one could help perceiving that she was extremely unhappy ; but then all the family knew she was very fond of Philip , and neither her mother nor brother could be surprised at her distress , though it certainly appeared to them excessive . Mrs. Edmonstone was very sorry for her , and very affectionate and considerate ; but Laura was too much absorbed in her own feelings to perceive or to be grateful for her kindness ; and as each day brought a no better report , her despair became so engrossing that she could not attempt any employment . She wandered in the garden , sat in dreamy fits of silence in the house , and at last , after receiving one of the worst accounts , sat up in her dressing - gown the whole of one night , in one dull , heavy , motionless trance of misery . She recollected that she must act her part , dressed in the morning and came down ; but her looks were ghastly ; she tasted no food , and as soon as possible left the breakfast - room . Her mother was going in quest of her when old nurse came with an anxious face to say,—'Ma'am , I am afraid Miss Edmonstone must be very ill , or something . Do you know , ma'am , her bed has not been slept in all night . '
211305	211314	211394	211394	she	159	' You do n't say so , nurse ! '
211315	211373	211394	211394	she	159	' Yes , ma'am , Jane told me so , and I went to look myself . Poor child , she is half distracted about master Philip , and no wonder , for they were always together ; but I thought you ought to know , ma'am , for she will make herself ill to a certainty . '
211374	211387	211394	211394	she	159	' I am going to see about her this moment , nurse , '
211412	211417	211419	211419	she	159	' Laura , dearest , '
211426	211437	211419	211419	she	159	' I can not bear to see you so unhappy . '

211488	211500	211471	211472	her mother	5185	' I do n't know . They did so with him ! '
211501	211517	211471	211472	her mother	5185	' My dear , this will never do . You are making yourself seriously unwell . '
211518	211534	211537	211537	Laura	454	' I wish — I wish I was ill ; I wish I was dying ! '
211549	211593	211537	211537	Laura	454	' My dear ! You do n't know what you are saying . You forget that this self - abandonment , and extravagant grief would be wrong in any one ; and , if nothing else , the display is unbecoming in you . '
211673	211739	211743	211743	Laura	454	' Her voice died away in a sob , though without tears . Her mother heard the words , but did not take in their full meaning ; and , believing that Laura 's undeveloped affection had led her to this uncontrolled grief , she spoke again , with coldness , intended to rouse her to a sense that she was compromising her womanly dignity . '
211774	211775	211769	211769	his	5324	' '
211813	211814	211815	211815	Laura	454	' '
211817	211825	211815	211815	Laura	454	' Mrs. Edmonstone stood still , overpowered . '
211831	211841	211828	211828	you	454	' She could not put the question more plainly . '
211847	211851	211844	211844	I	0	' cried Laura . '
211857	211876	211852	211852	I	0	' she answered herself in a tone of despair , as she hid her face in her hands ; '
211884	211907	211908	211908	Laura	454	' Her mother was too shocked to speak in the soft , reluctant manner in which she was wo nt to reprove . '
211910	211914	211908	211908	Laura	454	' said she , '
211928	212152	212153	212153	She	3854	' Laura only replied by a flood of tears , ungovernable from the exhaustion of sleeplessness and want of food . Mrs. Edmonstone 's kindness returned ; she soothed her , begged her to control herself , and at length brought her into the house , and up to the dressing - room , where she sank on the sofa , weeping violently . It was the reaction of the long restraint she had been exercising on herself , and the silence she had been maintaining . She was not feeling the humiliation of her own acknowledgment of disobedience , but of the horror of being forced to reveal the secret he had left in her charge . Long did she weep , breaking out more piteously at each attempt of her mother to lead her to explain . Poor Mrs. Edmonstone was alarmed and perplexed beyond measure ; this half - confession had so overthrown all her ideas that she was ready to apprehend everything most improbable , and almost expected to hear of a private marriage . Her presence seemed only to make Laura worse , and at length she said,—'I shall leave you for half an hour , in hopes that by that time you may have recovered yourself , and be able to give the explanation which I require . '
212269	212274	212275	212275	She	3854	' Well , Laura ? '
212297	212313	212294	212294	she	3854	' Surely , my dear , you need not be afraid to tell me anything ? '
212328	212339	212314	212314	Laura	454	' What have I said ? Have I told it ? '
212340	212351	212353	212354	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' What ? You have given me reason to believe , '
212365	212390	212359	212359	herself	159	' that you think Philip is attached to you . You do not deny it . Let me know on what terms you stand . '
212398	212412	212395	212395	she	3854	' If you would not force it from me at such a time . '
212413	212471	212314	212314	Laura	454	' Laura , it is for your own good . You are wretched now , my poor child ; why not relieve yourself , by telling all ? If you have not acted openly , can you have any comfort till you have confessed ? It may be a painful effort , but relief will come afterwards . '
212472	212479	212481	212481	Laura	454	' I have nothing to confess , '
212483	212493	212481	212481	Laura	454	' There is no such thing as you think . '
212494	212498	212314	212314	Laura	454	' No engagement ? '
212499	212502	212314	212314	Laura	454	' No . '
212503	212515	212314	212314	Laura	454	' Then , what am I to understand by your exclamations ? '
212516	212522	212524	212524	Laura	454	' It is no engagement , '
212526	212547	212524	212524	Laura	454	' He would never have asked that without papa 's consent . We are only bound by our own hearts . '
212548	212558	212314	212314	Laura	454	' And you have a secret understanding with him ? '
212559	212599	212314	212314	Laura	454	' We have never written to each other ; we have never dreamed of any intercourse that could be called clandestine . He would scorn it . He waited only for his promotion , to declare it to papa . '
212600	212611	212524	212524	Laura	454	' And how long has it been declared to you ? '
212612	212622	212314	212314	Laura	454	' Ever since the first summer Guy was here . '
212623	212627	212629	212630	her mother	5185	' Three years ! '
212632	212645	212629	212630	her mother	5185	' You have kept this from me three years ! O Laura ! '
212646	212655	212657	212657	Laura	454	' It was of no use to speak ! '
212674	212678	212680	212681	her mother	5185	' no use , '
212699	212713	212680	212681	her mother	5185	' No use to inform your parents , before you pledged your affections ! '
212714	212719	212721	212721	Laura	454	' Indeed , mamma , '
212723	212733	212721	212721	Laura	454	' I was sure that you knew his worth . '
212734	212757	212680	212681	her mother	5185	' Worth ! when he was teaching you to live in a course of insincerity ? Your father will be deeply hurt . '
212782	212791	212792	212792	Laura	454	' and another paroxysm of tears came on . '
212852	212875	212846	212846	you	454	' Laura was touched by the sorrow of her tone ; and , throwing her arms round her neck , sobbed out , '
212885	212894	212876	212876	You	454	' Mrs. Edmonstone was softened in a moment . '
212908	212918	212920	212920	you	0	' and she kissed her , with many tears . '
212924	212928	212920	212920	you	0	' whispered Laura . '
212948	213010	213011	213011	You	0	' Laura ceased , seeing her determined , and yielded to her pity , allowing herself to be nursed as she required , so exhausted was she . She was laid on the sofa , and made comfortable with pillows , in her mother 's gentlest way . When Mrs. Edmonstone was called away , Laura held her dress , saying , '
213033	213034	213024	213024	you	0	' '
213046	213067	213024	213024	you	0	' She could not help saying so ; but , feeling as if she had been cruel , she added , '
213092	213157	213085	213085	I	0	' proceeded she , still arranging for Laura 's ease ; then kissing her , hoped she would sleep , and left her . Sympathy was a matter of necessity to Mrs. Edmonstone ; and as her husband was out , she went at once to Charles , with a countenance so disturbed , that he feared some worse tidings had come from Italy . '
213172	213173	213170	213170	Laura	454	' '
213176	213194	213170	213170	Laura	454	' said Charles , with a significant though anxious look , that caused her to exclaim , — '
213201	213222	213196	213196	you	0	' Charlotte , who was reading in the window , trembled lest she should be seen , and sent away . '
213243	213244	213236	213236	you	0	' '
213284	213300	213266	213266	you	0	' She had expected a great storm ; but Charles only observed , very coolly , '

213344	213375	213327	213327	you	0	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , with the odd sort of laugh with which even the most sensitive people , in the height of their troubles , reply to anything ludicrous ; '
213379	213383	213327	213327	you	0	' she continued , '

213547	213587	213543	213543	He	3879	' said Charles , with the decided manner in which people prophecy the restoration of those they dislike , probably from a feeling that they must not die , till there is more charity in their opinion of them . '
213595	213596	213543	213543	He	3879	' '
213611	213615	213601	213601	we	3886	' said Charles . '

213771	213776	213755	213755	you	156	' proceeded Mrs. Edmonstone ; '
213786	213787	213755	213755	you	156	' '
213793	213797	213755	213755	you	156	' said Charles ; '

213862	213873	213854	213854	Charlie	156	' and Mrs. Edmonstone 's eyes were full of tears . '

213897	213909	213895	213895	mother	5239	' said Charles , face and voice full of affectionate emotion . '
213981	214010	213974	213974	I	0	' Charlotte did not venture to give way to her desire to kiss her mother , and thank Charles , lest she should be exiled as an intruder . '
214013	214023	213974	213974	I	0	' proceeded Charles , serious , though somewhat roguish , '
214055	214056	214057	214061	A weak , silly mother	3897	' '
214063	214091	214057	214061	A weak , silly mother	3897	' sighed Mrs. Edmonstone . This was too much for Charlotte , who sprang forward , and flung her arms round her neck , sobbing out , — '
214120	214219	214115	214115	Guy	150	' At the same time Bustle , perceiving a commotion , made a leap , planted his forefeet on Mrs. Edmonstone 's lap , wagging his tail vehemently , and trying to lick her face . It was not in human nature not to laugh , and Mrs. Edmonstone did so as heartily as either of the young ones ; indeed , Charlotte was the first to resume her gravity , not being sure of her ground , and being hurt at her impulse of affection being thus reduced to the absurd . She began to apologise , — '
214239	214240	214231	214231	you	6301	' '
214245	214253	214231	214231	you	6301	' and her mother kissed her warmly , '
214273	214314	214264	214264	You	2357	' Then , recollecting her prudence , she proceeded,—'You are old enough to understand the distress this insincerity of poor Laura 's has occasioned , and now that Amy is gone , we must look to you to comfort us . '

215084	215090	215071	215072	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Recoara , September 8th . '

215209	215303	215305	215305	you	3923	' The reading was followed by a dead silence , then Mr. Edmonstone said he had always known how it would be , and what would poor Amy do ? Mrs. Edmonstone was too unhappy to answer , for she could see no means of helping them . Mr. Edmonstone was of no use in a sick - room , and she had never thought it possible to leave Charles . It did not even occur to her that she could do so till Charles himself suggested that she must go to Amy . '
215309	215321	215305	215305	you	3923	' said she , as if it was a new light . '
215344	215345	215333	215333	She	425	' '
215354	215360	215346	215347	Dr. Mayerne	206	' said she , considering , '

215397	215402	215392	215393	Some one	5346	' said Mrs. Edmonstone ; '
215429	215430	215431	215432	No one	567	' '
215438	215442	215431	215432	No one	567	' said Charles ; '
215454	215758	215759	215759	Mary	208	' It was settled that if the next account was not more favourable , Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone should set off for Recoara . Laura heard , in consternation , at the thought of her father 's meeting Philip , still weak and unwell , without her , and perhaps with Guy too ill to be consulted . And oh ! what would Philip think of her ? Her weakness had disclosed his secret , and sunk her beneath him , and he must hear it from others . She felt as if she could have thrown herself at her mother 's feet as she implored her to forbear , to spare him , to spare her . Her mother pitied her incoherent distress , but it did not make her feel more in charity with Philip . She would not promise that the subject should not be discussed , but she tried to re - assure Laura , by saying , that nothing should be done that could retard his recovery . With this Laura was obliged to content herself ; and early the second morning , after the letter arrived , she watched the departure of her father and mother . She had expected to find the care of Charles very anxious work , but she prospered beyond her hopes . He was very kind and considerate , and both he and Charlotte were so sobered by anxiety , that there was no fear of their spirits overpowering her . Mary Ross used to come almost every afternoon to inquire . One day she found Charles alone , crutching himself slowly along the terrace , and she thought nothing showed the forlorn state of the family so much as to see him out of doors with no one for a prop .

216219	216224	216226	216226	Mary	208	' Where is Laura ? '
216230	216255	216226	216226	Mary	208	' I turned her out to walk with Charlotte , and I want some counsel , as mamma says I know nothing of lovers . '
216256	216263	216153	216153	we	3934	' Because I know so much ? '
216264	216343	216153	216153	we	3934	' You know feminine nature . I want to know what is the best thing to do for Laura . Poor thing ! I ca n't bear to see her look so wretched , worrying herself with care of me . I have done the best I could by taking Charlotte 's lessons , and sending her out to mope alone , as she likes best ; but I wish you would tell me how to manage her . '
216344	216356	216226	216226	Mary	208	' I know nothing better for her than waiting on you . '

216366	216417	216364	216364	Charles	156	' that having made the world dance attendance on me for my pleasure , I must now do it for theirs . But what do you think about telling her of this letter , or showing it , remembering that not a word about her troubles has passed between us ? '
216418	216449	216153	216153	we	3934	' By all means tell her . You must judge about showing it , but I should think the opening for talking to her on the subject a great gain . '
216450	216489	216153	216153	we	3934	' Should you ? What , thinking as I do of the man ? Should I not be between the horns of a dilemma if I had to speak the honest truth , yet not hurt her feelings ? '
216490	216511	216153	216153	we	3934	' She has been so long shut up from sympathy , that any proof of kindness must be a comfort . '
216512	216603	216153	216153	we	3934	' Well , I should like to do her some good ; but it will be a mercy , if she does not make me fall foul of Philip ! I can get up a little Christian charity , when my father or Charlotte rave at him , but I ca n't stand hearing him praised . I take the opportunity of saying so while I can , for I expect he will come home as her betrothed , and then we shall not be able to say one word . '
216604	216659	216153	216153	we	3934	' No , I dare say he will be so altered and subdued that you will not be so disposed to rail . This confession is a grand thing . Good - bye ; I must get back to church . Poor Laura ! how busy she has been about her sketch there lately . '
216660	216713	216153	216153	we	3934	' Yes , she has been eager about finishing it ever since Guy began to be ill . Good - by . Wish me well through my part of confidant to - night . It is much against the grain , though I would give something to cheer up my poor sister . '

217226	217234	217224	217224	Laura	454	' said Charles , finishing the letter , '

217280	217289	217278	217278	you	0	' said Laura , struggling with her tears . '

217399	217444	217445	217445	You	0	' It was the absence of any tone of satire that made this speech come home to Laura , as it was meant . There was no grudging in the praise , and she answered , in a very low , broken voice , — '
217485	217495	217480	217480	his	5164	' She gave it to him . The address , '
217502	217574	217480	217480	his	5164	' was a mere scrawl , and within the writing was very trembling and weak . Charles remarked it , and she answered by saying that her own letter began in his own strong hand , but failed and grew shaky at the end , as if from fatigue and agitation . The words were few , brief , and simple , very unlike his usual manner of letter - writing . '

217636	217640	217642	217642	Charles	156	' Poor Philip ! '
217924	217934	217935	217935	he	150	' I think I could bear acute pain better ! '
217960	218146	218148	218148	mamma	5168	' Indeed , it seemed as if the close air of the shut in valley , at the end of a long hot day , was almost enough to overwhelm him , weak as he had become . Every morning , when Amabel let in the fresh breeze at the window , she predicted it would be a cool day , and do him good ; every afternoon , the wind abated , the sun shone full in , the room was stifling , the faintness came on , and after a few vain attempts at relieving it , Guy sighed that there was nothing for it but quiet , and Amy was obliged to acquiesce . As the sun set in , the breeze sprung up , it became cooler , he fell asleep , awoke revived , was comfortable all the evening , and Amy left him at eleven or twelve , with hopes of his having a good night . It seemed to her as if ages had passed in this way , when one evening , two letters were brought in . '
218150	218154	218148	218148	mamma	5168	' said she ; '
218159	218164	218148	218148	mamma	5168	' holding it up , '

218187	218191	218185	218185	Markham	157	' said Guy . '
218202	218239	218240	218240	They	3949	' The letter to tell them Redclyffe was ready to receive them ! Amabel put it down with a strange sensation , and opened her mother 's . With a start of joy she exclaimed , — '
218246	218247	218240	218240	They	3949	' '
218253	218254	218240	218240	They	3949	' '

218380	218381	218351	218351	She	3952	' '
218420	218523	218524	218525	Poor Markham	490	' The last words were spoken very low ; and she did not disturb him by saying anything till he asked about the rest of the letter , and desired her to read Markham 's to him . This cost her some pain , for it had been written in ignorance of even Philip 's illness , and detailed triumphantly the preparations at Redclyffe , hinting that they must send timely notice of their return , or they would disappoint the tenantry , who intended grand doings , and concluding with a short lecture on the inexpediency of lingering in foreign parts . '
218527	218589	218524	218525	Poor Markham	490	' said Guy . She understood ; but these things did not come on her like a shock now , for he had been saying them more or less ever since the beginning of his illness ; and fully occupied as she was , she never opened her mind to the future . After a long silence , Guy said , — '
218608	218609	218613	218613	you	0	' '
218615	218616	218613	218613	you	0	' '

218654	218664	218635	218635	You	0	' said she , as he looked at her . '
218670	218676	218665	218665	I	0	' said he , presently , '
218741	218860	218861	218861	I	0	' She gazed at him without answering . If there had been any struggle to retain him , it would have been repressed by his calmness ; but the thought had not come on her suddenly , it was more like an inevitable fate seen at first at a distance , and gradually advancing upon her . She had never fastened on the hope of his recovery , and it had dwindled in an almost imperceptible manner . She kept watch over him , and followed his thoughts , without stretching her mind to suppose herself living without him ; and was supported by the forgetfulness of self , which gave her no time to realize her feelings . '
218871	218879	218861	218861	I	0	' said Guy , after a space . '
218942	218957	218958	218958	he	0	' He spoke slowly , pausing between each recollection,—'You will see it some day , '
218961	218979	218958	218958	he	0	' But I must give it up ; it is earth after all , and looking back . '
219180	219188	219189	219189	she	3959	' You have had a good night ? '
219192	219204	219189	219189	she	3959	' I have had my wish , I have seen Redclyffe ; '
219212	219286	219189	219189	she	3959	' Of course , it was a sort of wandering ; but I never quite lost the consciousness of being here , and it was very delightful . I saw the waves , each touched with light,—the foam — the sea - birds , floating in shade and light,—the trees — the Shag — the sky — oh ! such a glory as I never knew — themselves — but so intensely glorious ! '
219287	219292	219294	219294	Amabel	234	' I am glad , '
219308	219316	219317	219317	he	0	' I do n't understand such goodness ! '
219320	219357	219317	219317	he	0	' As if it were not enough to look to heaven beyond , to have this longing gratified , which I thought I ought to conquer . Oh , Amy ! is not that being Fatherly ? '
219358	219363	219189	219189	she	3959	' Yes , indeed . '
219364	219396	219189	219189	she	3959	' Now , after that , and with mamma 's coming ( for you will have her if I do n't see her ) , I have but one wish unfulfilled . '
219397	219403	219317	219317	he	0	' Ah ! a clergyman . '
219404	219442	219189	219189	she	3959	' Yes ; but if that is withheld , I must believe it is rightly ordered . We must think of that Sunday at Stylehurst , and Christmas - day , and that last time at Munich . '
219443	219457	219189	219189	she	3959	' Oh , I am so glad we staid at Munich for that ! '
219458	219496	219497	219497	He	3964	' Those were times , indeed ! and many more . Yes ; I have been a great deal too much favoured already , and now to be allowed to die just as I should have chosen — '
219593	219614	219590	219590	Guy	150	' Do you think Philip could come to me to - day ? I want much to speak to him . '
219615	219622	219590	219590	Guy	150	' I am sure he could . '
219623	219640	219641	219641	Philip	454	' Then pray ask him to come , if it will not tire him very much . '
219878	219887	219888	219888	she	5186	' He is very anxious to see you , '
219891	219922	219888	219888	she	5186	' He is wishing to set all in order . And if he does speak about — about dying , will you be so kind as not to contradict him ? '
219923	219929	219931	219931	Philip	454	' There is no danger ? '
219941	219954	219931	219931	Philip	454	' He is no worse ? You said the fever was lower . '
219955	220001	220003	220003	she	5186	' He is rather better , I think ; but he wishes so much to have everything arranged , that I am sure it will be better for him to have it off his mind . So , will you bear it , please Philip ? '
220017	220024	220025	220025	he	454	' How do you bear it ? '
220028	220040	220041	220041	Philip	454	' I do n't know — I ca n't vex him . '
220054	220069	220070	220070	she	5186	' In an hour 's time , perhaps , or whenever he was ready , '
220073	220366	220070	220070	she	5186	' for he could rest in the sitting - room before coming in to Guy . He found mounting the stairs harder than he had expected ; and , with aching knees and gasping breath , at length reached the sitting - room , where Amabel was ready to pity him , and made him rest on the sofa till he had fully recovered . She then conducted him in ; and his first glance gave him infinite relief , for he saw far less change than was still apparent in himself . Guy 's face was at all times too thin to be capable of losing much of its form ; and as he was liable to be very much tanned , the brown , fixed on his face by the sunshine of his journey , had not gone off , and a slight flush on his cheeks gave him his ordinary colouring ; his beautiful hazel eyes were more brilliant than ever ; and though the hand he held out was hot and wasted , Philip could not think him nearly as ill as he had been himself , and was ready to let him talk as he pleased . He was reassured , too , by his bright smile , and the strength of his voice , as he spoke a few playful words of welcome and congratulation . Amy set a chair , and with a look to remind Philip to be cautious , glided into her own room , leaving the door open , so as to see and hear all that passed , for they were not fit to be left absolutely alone together . Philip sat down ; and after a little pause Guy began : '
220387	220410	220411	220411	I	0	' A horror came over Philip ; but he saw Amy writing at her little table , and felt obliged to refrain . '
220419	220423	220411	220411	I	0	' said Guy . '
220443	220444	220439	220439	I	0	' '
220449	220450	220451	220452	Old Markham	491	' '

220535	220536	220555	220555	you	3970	' '
220710	220712	220689	220689	you	3970	' That '
220714	220746	220747	220747	Amy	425	' gave Philip some comfort , though it did not mean what he fancied . He thought of Guy 's recovery ; Guy referred to the possibility of Amabel 's guardianship . '
220769	220773	220747	220747	Amy	425	' said Guy . '
220884	220923	220924	220926	My poor uncle	7331	' All this had been spoken with pauses for recollection , and for Philip 's signs of assent . Amabel came to give him some cordial , and as soon as she had retreated he went on : — '
221049	221050	221045	221045	you	3970	' '
221057	221058	221045	221045	you	3970	' '
221089	221106	221082	221082	you	3970	' Another silence followed ; after which Guy said , smiling , with his natural playfulness , '
221168	221189	221166	221166	trustees	3991	' Philip heard as if a flash of light was blinding him , and he interrupted with an exclamation : — '
221201	221202	221205	221205	I	0	' '
221212	221258	221205	221205	I	0	' He stopped , for he was unheard . At the first word Philip had sunk on his knees , hiding his face on the bed - clothes , in an agony of self - abasement , before the goodness he had been relentlessly persecuting . '
221263	221274	221205	221205	I	0	' he said , in a sort of stifled sob . '
221282	221304	221278	221278	you	0	' He could not look up ; but he felt Guy 's hand touch his head , and heard him say , '
221333	221400	221278	221278	you	0	' As he spoke there was a knock at the door , and with the instinctive dread of being found in his present posture , Philip sprang to his feet . Amabel went to the door , and was told that the physician was downstairs with two gentlemen , and a card was given her , on which she read the name of an English clergyman . '
221405	221409	221278	221278	you	0	' said Guy . '
221422	221452	221453	221453	You	3992	' Amabel was to go and speak to them , and Guy would see Mr. Morris , the clergyman , as soon as the physician had made his visit . '
221459	221466	221453	221453	You	3992	' he then said to Philip . '
221489	221503	221480	221480	We	3994	' and his calm brightness was a contrast to Philip 's troubled look . '
221511	221632	221635	221635	he	3995	' he added , as Philip turned away . Long ago , letters had been written to Venice , begging that if an English clergyman should travel that way , he might be told how earnestly his presence was requested ; this was the first who had answered the summons . He was a very young man , much out of health , and travelling under the care of a brother , who was in great dread of his doing anything to injure himself . Amabel soon perceived that , though kind and right - minded , he could not help them , except as far as his office was concerned . He was very shy , only just in priests '
221785	221809	221771	221771	he	571	' One longs to humble oneself to him . How it puts one to shame to hear such repentance with such a confession ! '
221873	221882	221894	221894	he	454	' We are ready . Come , Philip . '
221883	221893	221894	221894	he	454	' I can not ; I am not worthy , '
221901	221914	221916	221916	she	3996	' Nay , you are surely in no uncharitableness with him now , '
221926	221953	221894	221894	he	454	' And if you are sorry — that is repentance — more fit now than ever — Wont you come ? Would you grieve him now ? '
221954	221963	221965	221965	Philip	454	' You take it on yourself , then , '
221983	221998	221975	221975	She	3996	' A broken and contrite heart , O God , Thou wilt not despise . '
222134	222138	222139	222139	he	454	' Thank you ! '
222143	222154	222155	222155	Philip	454	' Good night . God bless you and my sister . '
222165	222186	222159	222159	he	454	' Poor fellow ! It will be worse for him than for you . You must take care of him . '
222413	222421	222407	222407	He	571	' Is no one here but you ? '
222422	222426	222464	222464	her	234	' No one . '
222427	222449	222464	222464	her	234	' My own sweet wife , my Verena , as you have always been . We have been very happy together . '
222450	222455	222457	222457	she	234	' Indeed we have , '
222475	222487	222468	222468	she	234	' It will not be so long before we meet again . '
222488	222500	222502	222503	your mother	5319	' A few months perhaps'—said Amabel , in a stifled voice , '
222504	222506	222468	222468	she	234	' — '

222532	222544	222528	222528	You	425	' She could say no more , but struggled for calmness . '
222547	222551	222528	222528	You	425	' he answered , '
222584	222590	222575	222575	I	0	' he added , smiling . '
222635	222665	222666	222666	My	0	' Amy listened , her eyes intently fixed on him , unable to repress her agitation , except by silence . After some little time , he spoke again . '
222820	222902	222814	222814	I	0	' He was again silent , as in contemplation , and Amabel 's overcoming emotion had been calmed and chastened down again , now that it was no longer herself that was spoken of . Both were still , and he seemed to sleep a little . When next he spoke it was to ask if she could repeat their old favourite lines in Sintram . They came to her lips , and she repeated them in a low steady voice . '
222907	222911	222912	222912	I	0	' repeated Guy ; '
222985	222991	222983	222983	Amy	425	' Out of the deep . ''

223140	223151	223111	223111	He	0	' It is of no use ; I can not . '
223244	223247	223248	223248	he	0	' Amy ! '
223259	223264	223248	223248	he	0	' Here , dearest ! '

The soul was with Him , with whom dwell the spirits of just men made perfect ; and there lay the earthly part with the smile on the face . She closed the dark fringed eyelids — saw him look more beautiful than in sleep , — then , laying her face down on the bed , she knelt on . She took no heed of time , no heed of aught that was earthly . How long she knelt she never knew , but she was roused by Anne 's voice in a frightened sob — '
223506	223518	223519	223519	she	4028	' She lifted her head , and Anne afterwards told Mary Ross '
223553	223589	223592	223593	a widow	4033	' She rose — looked at his face again — saw Arnaud was at hand — let Anne lead her into the next room , and shut the door . Christian Year . The four months '

224487	224550	224485	224485	Amabel	234	' You will be happier , indeed , Philip , if you would only think what glory it is , and that he is all safe , and has won the victory , and will have no more of those hard , hard struggles and bitter repentance . It has been such a night , that it seems wrong to be sorry . '
224551	224561	224454	224454	he	454	' Did you say he spoke of me again ? '
224562	224606	224485	224485	Amabel	234	' Yes ; here is his Prayer - book . Your father gave it to him , and he meant to have told you about it himself , only he could not talk yesterday evening , and could not part with it till — '
224628	224636	224637	224637	she	425	' He 's very fond of it , '
224640	224649	224637	224637	she	425	' it is the one he always uses . '
224683	224708	224832	224832	her	425	' My father , my father ! He would have done him justice . If he had lived , this would never have been ! '
224709	224720	224722	224722	Amy	425	' That is over ; you do him justice now , '
224724	224828	224830	224830	she	425	' You did , indeed you did , make him quite happy . He said so again and again . I never saw him so happy as when you began to get better . I do n't think any one ever had so much happiness ; and it never ceased , it was all quiet , and peace and joy , till it brightened quite into perfect day — and the angel 's song ! Do n't you remember yesterday , how clear and sweet his voice came out in that , and it was the last thing almost he said . I believe '
224841	224975	224830	224830	she	425	' The earnest placid voice , speaking thus , in calmness and simplicity , could not fail in soothing him ; but he was so shaken and exhausted that she had great difficulty in restoring him . After a time , he lay perfectly still on the sofa , and she was sitting by , relieved by the tranquillity , when there was a knock at the door , and Arnaud came in , and stood hesitating , as if he hardly knew how to begin . The present fear of agitating her charge helped her now , when obliged to turn her thoughts to the subject on which she knew Arnaud was come . She went to the door , and spoke low , hoping her cousin might not hear or understand . '
224982	224983	224984	224985	My lady	4028	' '
224991	224998	224984	224985	My lady	4028	' said Arnaud , looking down . '
225036	225037	225038	225038	I	0	' '
225044	225056	225038	225038	I	0	' said Amabel , reluctant to send such messages through servants . '
225060	225084	225058	225058	me	0	' said Philip , who understood what was going on , and was of course impelled to spare her as much as possible . '
225088	225092	225058	225058	me	0	' said she , '
225098	225099	225104	225104	I	0	' '
225110	225111	225104	225104	I	0	' '
225114	225124	225125	225125	you	0	' said she , as he was setting forth ; '
225136	225147	225148	225148	He	4054	' He put his hand to his head in confusion . '
225155	225159	225148	225148	He	4054	' said Amabel , '
225162	225200	225148	225148	He	4054	' But this renewal of the assurance of the death was too much ; and covering his face with his hands , he sank back in another paroxysm of violent sobs . Amabel could not leave him . '
225218	225754	225213	225213	I	0	' said she , then returned to her task of comfort , till she again saw Philip lying , with suspended faculties , in the repose of complete exhaustion . She then went to Mr. Morris , with a look and tone of composure that almost startled him , thanking him for his assistance in the arrangements . The funeral was to be at sunrise the next day , before the villagers began to keep the feast of St. Michael , and the rest was to be settled by Arnaud and Mr. Morris . He then said somewhat reluctantly that his brother had desired to know whether Lady Morville wished to see him today , and begged to be sent for ; but Amy plainly perceived that he thought it very undersirable for his brother to have any duties to perform to - day . She questioned herself whether she might not ask him to read to her , and whether it might be better for Philip ; but she thought she ought not to ask what might injure him merely for her own comfort ; and , besides , Philip was entirely incapable of self - command , and it would not be acting fairly to expose him to the chance of discovering to a stranger , feelings that he would ordinarily guard so scrupulously . She therefore gratefully refused the offer , and Mr. Morris very nearly thanked her for doing so . He took his leave , and she knew she must return to her post , but first she indulged herself with one brief visit to the room where all her cares and duties had lately centred . A look , a thought , a prayer — The beauteous expression there fixed was a help , as it had ever been in life , and she went back again cheered and sustained . Throughout that day she attended on her cousin , whose bodily indisposition required as much care as his mind needed soothing . She talked to him , read to him , tried to set him the example of taking food ; took thought for him as if he was the chief sufferer , as if it was the natural thing for her to do , working in the strength her husband had left her , and for him who had been his chief object of care . She had no time to herself , except the few moments that she allowed herself now and then to spend in gazing at the dear face that was still her comfort and joy ; until , at last , late in the evening , she succeeded in reading Philip to sleep . Then , as she sat in the dim candlelight , with everything in silence , a sense of desolation came upon her , and she knew that she was alone . At that moment a carriage thundered at the door , and she remembered for the first time that she was expecting her father and mother . She softly left the room , and closed the door ; and finding Anne in the next room , sent her down . '
225760	225764	225766	225766	her	5168	' said she ; '
225776	225826	225766	225766	her	5168	' They entered , and there stood Amabel , her face a little flushed , just like , only calmer , the daughter they had parted with on her bridal day , four months ago . She held up her hand as a sign of silence , and said , '
225834	225944	225832	225832	Philip	454	' Mr. Edmonstone was almost angry , and actually began an impatient exclamation , but broke it off with a sob , caught her in his arms , kissed her , and then buried his face in his handkerchief . Mrs. Edmonstone , still aghast at the tidings they had met at Vicenza , and alarmed at her unnatural composure , embraced her ; held her for some moments , then looked anxiously to see her weep . But there was not a tear , and her voice was itself , though low and weak , as , while her father began pacing up and down , she repeated , '
225958	225959	225960	225960	Philip	454	' '
225964	225971	225960	225960	Philip	454	' said Mr. Edmonstone , hastily : '
225982	225983	225974	225974	you	454	' '
225990	225994	225988	225988	you	0	' said Amy . '
226003	226127	225988	225988	you	0	' Mrs. Edmonstone was extremely alarmed , sure that this was grief too deep for outward tokens , and had no peace till she had made Amabel consent to come up with her , and go at once to bed . To this she agreed , after she had rung for Arnaud , and stood with him in the corridor , to desire him to go at once to Captain Morville , as softly as he could , and when he waked , to say Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone were come , but she thought he had better not see them to - night ; to tell him from her that she wished him good night , and hoped he would sleep quietly . '
226159	226250	226253	226253	he	186	' Mrs. Edmonstone was very impatient of this colloquy , and glad when Amabel ended it , and led the way upstairs . She entered her little room , then quietly opened another door , and Mrs. Edmonstone found herself standing by the bed , where that which was mortal lay , with its face bright with the impress of immortality . The shock was great , for he was indeed as a son to her , but her fears for Amabel would not leave room for any other thought . '
226256	226267	226253	226253	he	186	' said Amy , with a smile like his own . '
226281	226292	226274	226274	you	811	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , trying to lead her away . '
226303	226309	226310	226310	I	0	' said she , submissively . '
226329	226337	226314	226314	I	0	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , much distressed ; '
226369	226370	226360	226360	you	811	' '
226389	226407	226384	226384	I	0	' said Amabel , with the tranquillity which her mother had hoped to shake by her allusion . '
226412	226622	226384	226384	I	0	' She took up Guy 's watch and a book from the table by the bedside , and came back to her sleeping - room . She wound up the watch , and then allowed her mother to undress her , answering all her inquiries about her health , in a gentle indifferent matter - of - fact way . She said little of Guy , but that little was without agitation , and in due time she lay down in bed . Still , whenever Mrs. Edmonstone looked at her there was no sleep in her eyes , and at last she persuaded her to leave her , on the plea that being watched made her more wakeful , as she did not like to see mamma sitting up . Almost as soon as it was light Mrs. Edmonstone returned , and was positively frightened ; for there stood Amabel , dressed in her white muslin , her white bonnet , and her deep lace wedding - veil . All her glossy hair was hidden away , and her face was placid as ever , though there was a red spot on each cheek . She saw her mother 's alarm , and reassured her by speaking calmly . '
226645	226646	226640	226640	you	4069	' '
226657	226658	226640	226640	you	4069	' '
226694	226813	226815	226815	she	4073	' Mrs. Edmonstone yielded , though her mind misgave her , comforted by hoping for the much - desired tears — But Amabel , who used to cry so easily for a trifle , had now not a tear . Her grief was as yet too deep , or perhaps more truly sorrow and mourning had not begun while the influence of her husband 's spirit was about her still . It was time to set forth , and the small party of mourners met in the long corridor . Mr. Edmonstone would have given his daughter his arm , but she said , I beg your pardon , dear papa , I do n't think I can ; '
227397	227411	227379	227379	her	234	' It is over now , Philip ; you had better come home . '
227540	227565	227516	227516	she	234	' Now you must rest , for you ought not to have come out . Lie down , and let mamma read to you . '
227579	227595	227572	227572	Amy	425	' Yes , dear mamma , I should like to be alone a little while . '
227608	227616	227617	227617	she	234	' I will give you the papers , '
227627	227633	227634	227634	she	234	' This is his will , '
227637	227685	227686	227686	She	234	' You will tell me if there is anything I must do at once . Here is a letter to Mr. Markham , and another to Mr. Dixon , if you will be so kind as to write and enclose them . Thank you , dear papa . '
228804	228814	228816	228817	Mr. Edmonstone	156	' Do n't , do n't , I beg , '
228826	228843	228844	228844	he	156	' Lie still ; you had much better . My stars ! how ill you look ! '
228856	228871	228844	228844	he	156	' You have had a sharpish touch ; but you are better , eh ? '
228872	228878	228844	228844	he	156	' Yes , thank you . '
228879	228958	228844	228844	he	156	' Well ; I thought I had better come and speak to you , if you felt up to it . Here is — here is,—I hope it is all right and legal ; but that you can tell better than I ; and you are concerued in it , any how . Here is poor Guy 's will , which we thought you had better look over , if you liked , and felt equal — eh ? '
228959	228963	228965	228965	Philip	454	' Thank you , '
229013	229019	228979	228979	his	156	' being an unpleasant thing , '
229021	229028	228979	228979	his	156	' best not raise his expectations ; '
229126	229163	229109	229109	he	156	' There Mr. Edmonstone stopped short , very much afraid of the effect ; but Philip raised himself , his face brightened , as if he was greatly relieved , and from his heart he exclaimed , '
229167	229168	229109	229109	he	156	' '
229179	229188	229109	229109	he	156	' answered Mr. Edmonstone , very much pleased . '
229218	229219	229213	229213	you	4135	' '
229223	229237	229213	229213	you	4135	' said Philip , shrinking into himself at even such praise as this . '
229242	229247	229251	229251	he	454	' said his uncle , '
229298	229327	229289	229289	I	0	' twas Heaven 's will ; and so — It does not signify , after all , if it is not quite formal . We understand each other . '
229555	229559	229545	229545	He	454	' thank you . '
229629	229642	229597	229597	He	454	' And what do you think of Amy 's being under age ? '
229648	229664	229597	229597	He	454	' How is she to act , poor dear ? Shall I act for her ? '
229665	229673	229675	229675	Philip	454	' She will soon be of age , '
229679	229714	229716	229716	he	454	' In January , poor darling . Who would have thought how it would have been with her . I little thought , last May — But holloa ! what have I been at ? '
229757	229772	229809	229809	he	156	' I did n't mean it , I am sure ! Here ! Mamma ! '
229773	229778	229780	229780	Philip	454	' No , no , '
229788	229803	229780	229780	Philip	454	' do n't call her , I beg . There is nothing the matter . '
229929	229938	229913	229914	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' Do you like it , my dear ? '
229939	229949	229951	229951	Amabel	234	' He told me to take care of him , '
229953	229968	229970	229971	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I can not feel that he deserves you should worry yourself about him , '
229973	229979	229970	229971	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' If you knew all — '
229980	230017	229913	229914	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I do know all , mamma,—if you mean about Laura . Surely you must forgive . Think how he repents . What , have you not had his letter ? Then how did you know ? '
230018	230041	229970	229971	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	' I learned it from Laura herself . Her trouble at his illness revealed it . Do you say he has written ! '
230042	230081	230082	230082	Amabel	234	' Yes , mamma ; he told Guy all about it , and was very sorry and wrote as soon as he was able . Guy sent you a long message . He was so anxious about it . '
230546	230553	230543	230543	She	234	' Yes , but for him , '
230949	230953	230935	230935	Amabel	234	' Not yet ; '
231198	231203	231205	231205	Amabel	234	' Then , mamma , '
231219	231230	231231	231231	she	234	' I must tell him . I beg your pardon , '
231236	231279	231231	231231	she	234	' but indeed I must . It is hard on him not to hear that you had not his letter , and that Laura has told . I know Guy would wish me , so do n't be displeased , dear mamma . '
231280	231291	231231	231231	she	234	' I ca n't be displeased with anything you do . '
231292	231299	231231	231231	she	234	' And you give me leave ? '
231300	231313	231231	231231	she	234	' To be sure I do,—leave to do anything but hurt yourself . '
231314	231354	231356	231356	she	234	' And would it be wrong for me to offer to write to him ? No one else will , and it will be sad for him not to hear . It can not be wrong , can it ? '
231380	231444	231356	231356	she	234	' Certainly not , my poor darling . Do just as you think fit . I am sorry for him , for I am sure he is in great trouble , and I should like him to be comforted — if he can . But , Amy , you must not ask me to do it . He has disappointed me too much . '
231813	231842	231802	231802	She	234	' I am come to you for a little quiet , out of the bustle of the packing up . I want you to do something for me . '
231843	231848	231802	231802	She	234	' Anything for you . '
231849	231859	231861	231861	she	234	' It is what you will like to do , '
231867	231912	231861	231861	she	234	' for it is more for him than for me . Could you , without teasing yourself , put that into Latin for me , by and by ? I think it should be in Latin , as it is in a foreign country . '
231947	231964	231965	231965	she	234	' Will you be so kind as to give it to Arnaud when it is done ? '
231968	231992	231965	231965	she	234	' he will send it to the man who is making the cross . I think the kind people here will respect it . '
231993	231996	231998	231998	Philip	454	' Yes , '
232000	232037	231998	231998	Philip	454	' it is soon done , and thank you for letting me do it . But , Amy , I would not alter your choice , yet there is one that seems to me more applicable , '

232236	232254	232255	232255	Amy	425	' After a moment 's pause , during which he looked at the paper , he said , '

232283	232315	232280	232280	I	0	' said she , and Philip drew it from under the sofa cushion , and began putting together his pocket gold pen . While he was doing this , she said , '

232342	232366	232323	232323	I	0	' said he , with a sigh , as if he would fain have said more . She paused , then said abruptly , '

He must let her be his comforter , though a moment before his mind would have revolted at troubling the newly - made widow with his love affairs . Amabel told him , as fully and clearly as she could , how the truth had come out , how gently Laura had been dealt with , how Charles had been trying to soften his father , and papa had not said one angry word to her . '
232594	232595	232596	232596	They	4192	' '

232754	232771	232742	232742	you	425	' he finished , sinking his voice , and again pressing his hand to his brow . '
232780	232787	232778	232778	Philip	454	' then , looking at him , '

235337	235350	235351	235351	I	0	' She read no more , but folded it up , saying , '
235404	235672	235373	235373	he	454	' She laid her head on the pillow as if she had done with the subject , and Laura did not venture to pursue it , but went down to hear her mother 's account of her . Mrs. Edmonstone was feeling it a great comfort to have her son to talk to again , and availed herself of it to tell him of Philip , while Laura was absent , and then to return to speak of Amy on Laura 's re - entrance . She said , all through the journey , Amy had been as passive and tranquil as possible , chiefly leaning back in the carriage in silence , excepting that when they finally left the view of the snowy mountains , she gazed after them as long as the least faint cloud - like summit was visible . Still she could not sleep , except that now and then she dozed a little in the carriage , but at night she heard every hour strike in turn , and lay awake through all , nor had she shed one tear since her mother had joined her . Mrs. Edmonstone 's anxiety was very great , for she said she knew Amy must pay for that unnatural calmness , and the longer it was before it broke down , the worse it would be for her . However , she was at home , that was one thing to be thankful for , and happen what might , it could not be as distressing as if it had been abroad . Another night of '
235676	236344	235373	235373	he	454	' and Amabel rose in the morning at her usual hour , to put on the garments of her widowhood , where she had last stood as a bride . Charles was actually startled by her entering the dressing - room , just as she used to do , before breakfast , to read with him , and her voice was as steady as ever . She breakfasted with the family , and came up afterwards with Laura to unpack her dressing - case , and take out the little treasures that she and her husband had enjoyed buying in the continental towns , as presents for the home party . All this , for which she had previously prepared herself , she underwent as quietly as possible ; but something unexpected came on her . Charlotte , trying to pet and comfort her in every possible way , brought in all the best flowers still lingering in the garden , and among them a last blossom of the Noisette rose , the same , of which Guy had been twisting a spray , while he first told her of his love . It was too much . It recalled his perfect health and vigour , his light activity , and enjoyment of life , and something came on her of the sensation we feel for an insect ; one moment full of joyous vitality , the next , crushed and still . She had hitherto thought of his feverish thirst and fainting weariness being at rest , and felt the relief , or else followed his spirit to its repose , and rejoiced ; but now the whole scene brought back what he once was ; his youthful , agile frame , his eyes dancing in light , his bounding step , his gay whistle , the strong hand that had upheld her on the precipice , the sure foot that had carried aid to the drowning sailors , the arm that was to have been her stay for life , all came on her in contrast with — death ! The thought swept over her , carrying away every other , and she burst into tears . The tears would have their course ; she could not restrain them when once they began , and her struggles to check them only brought an increase of them . Her sobs grew so violent that Laura , much alarmed , made a sign to Charlotte to fetch her mother ; and Mrs. Edmonstone , coming in haste , found it was indeed the beginning of a frightful hysterical attack . The bodily frame had been overwrought to obey the mental firmness and composure , and now nature asserted her rights ; the hysterics returned again and again , and when it seemed as if exhaustion had at length produced quiet , the opening of a door , or a sound in the distance , would renew all again . It was not till night had closed in , that Mrs. Edmonstone was at all satisfied about her , and had at length the comfort of seeing her fall into a sound deep sleep ; such an unbroken dreamless sleep , as had scarcely visited her since she first went to Recoara . Even this sleep did not restore her ; she became very unwell , and both Dr. Mayerne and her mother insisted on her avoiding the least exertion or agitation . She was quite submissive , only begging earnestly to be allowed to see Mr. Ross , saying she knew it would do her good rather than harm , and promising to let him leave her the instant she found it too much for her ; and though Mrs. Edmonstone was reluctant and afraid , they agreed that as she was so reasonable and docile , she ought to be allowed to judge for herself . She begged that he might come after church on All Saints '

For a long time nothing was heard of him at Hollywell , and she began to fear that he might have been less fit to take care of himself , than he had persuaded her to believe . When at length tidings reached them , it was through the De Courcys . " Poor Morville , " wrote Maurice , " had been carried ashore at Corfu , in the stupor of a second attack of fever . He had been in extreme danger for some time , and though now on the mend , was still unable to give any account of himself . " In effect , it was a relapse of the former disease , chiefly affecting the brain , and his impatience to leave Recoara , and free himself from Arnaud had been a symptom of its approach , though it fortunately did not absolutely overpower him till after he had embarked for Corfu , and was in the way to be tended with the greatest solicitude . Long after the fever was subdued , and his strength returning , his mind was astray ; and even , when torturing delusions ceased , and he resumed the perception of surrounding objects , memory and reflection wavered in dizzy confusion , more distressing than either his bodily weakness , or the perpetual pain in his head , which no remedy could relieve . The first date to which he could afterwards recur , though for more than a week he had apparently been fully himself , was a time when he was sitting in an easy chair by the window , obliged to avert his heavy eyes from the dazzling waters of the Corcyran bay , where Ulysses '

239623	239641	239642	239642	He	176	' Hardly — except that there is no winter here . This is the 8th of January . '
239831	239859	239911	239911	he	176	' None from Hollywell ! Has nothing been heard from them ? Thorndale , I insist on knowing whether De Courcy has heard anything of Lady Morville . '

239871	239905	239911	239911	he	176	' My sister mentions that — more than two months ago — I can hardly believe she has not written , if she was able . She promised , yet how can I expect '

The bell rang , he rushed back , and was whirled away . '

240494	240511	240485	240485	you	4343	' said Philip , who was leaning back wearily ; but the next moment he exclaimed , '

240527	240528	240514	240514	you	4343	' '

240615	240638	240606	240606	you	4343	' said Philip , unable to bear hearing Amabel thus spoken of , yet desirous to learn all he could respecting her . '
240645	240650	240606	240606	you	4343	' was the answer . '
240674	240708	240606	240606	you	4343	' There was a sudden flush on Philip 's pale face that caused his sister to pause in her measured , self - satisfied speech , and ask if he was in pain . '
240711	241121	240606	240606	you	4343	' he replied shortly , and Margaret pondered on his strange manner , little guessing what profanation her mention of Amabel 's letter had seemed to him , or how it jarred on him to hear this exaggerated likeness of his own self - complacent speeches . She was much shocked and grieved to see him so much more unwell than she had expected . He was unfit for anything but to go to bed on his arrival . Dr. Henley said the system had received a severe shock , and it would be long before the effects would be shaken off ; but that there was no fear but his health would be completely restored if he would give himself entire rest . There was no danger that Margaret would not lavish care enough on her brother . She waited on him in his room all the next day , bringing him everything he could want , and trying to make him come down stairs , for she thought sitting alone there very bad for his spirits ; but he said he had a letter to write , and very curious she was to know why he was so long doing it , and why he did not tell her to whom it was addressed . However , she saw when it was put into the post - bag , that it was for Lady Morville . At last , too late to see any of the visitors who had called to inquire , when the evening had long closed in , she had the satisfaction of seeing Philip enter the drawing - room , and settling him in the most comfortable of her easy chairs on one side of the fire to wait till the doctor returned for dinner . The whole apartment , was most luxurious , spacious , and richly furnished , the fire , in its brilliant steel setting , glancing on all around , and illuminating her own stately presence , and rich glacé silk , as she sat opposite her brother cutting open the leaves of one of the books of the club over which she presided . She felt that this was something like attaining one of the objects for which she used to say and think she married,—namely , to be able to receive her brother in a comfortable home . If only he would but look more like himself . '

Yours was only prejudice ; mine , I must call by a darker name . Remember , that he and his wife are only to be spoken of with reverence . '
242595	242646	242575	242575	Margaret	347	' Of course we owe him a great deal of gratitude . It was very kind and proper to come to you when you were ill , and his death must have been a terrible shock . He was a fine young man ; amiable , very attractive in manner . '
242647	242651	242653	242653	Philip	454	' No more ! '
242655	242664	242666	242666	she	347	' That , you always said of him , '
242671	242707	242666	242666	she	347	' but you have no need to reproach yourself . You always acted the part of a true friend ; did full justice to his many good qualities , and only sought his real good . '
242708	242720	242722	242722	Philip	454	' Every word you speak is the bitterest satire on me , '
242732	242744	242722	242722	Philip	454	' Say no more , unless you would drive me distracted ! '
242844	242851	242853	242854	the Doctor	5336	' What has he been doing ? '
242856	242874	242853	242854	the Doctor	5336	' here is his pulse up to a hundred again . How can he have raised it ? '
242875	242892	242853	242854	the Doctor	5336	' He only came down an hour ago , and has been sitting still ever since . '
242893	242896	242853	242854	the Doctor	5336	' Talking ? '
242897	242959	242853	242854	the Doctor	5336	' Yes ; and there , perhaps , I was rather imprudent . I did not know he could so little bear to hear poor Sir Guy 's name mentioned ; and besides , he did not know , till I told him , that he had so much chance of Redclyffe . He did not know the entail excluded daughters . '
242960	243014	242853	242854	the Doctor	5336	' Did he not ? That accounts for it . I should like to see the man who could hear coolly that he was so near such a property . This suspense is unlucky just now ; very much against him . You must turn his thoughts from it as much as possible . '
243586	243615	243578	243578	she	890	' I understand it all , poor fellow ; I thought long ago he had some secret attachment , and now I see it was to Amabel Edmonstone . '
243616	243621	243578	243578	she	890	' To Lady Morville ? '
243622	243681	243578	243578	she	890	' Yes . You know how constantly he was at Hollywell , my aunt so fond of him ! I do n't suppose Amy knew of it ; and , of course , she could not be blamed for accepting such an offer as Sir Guy 's ; besides , she never had much opinion of her own . '
243682	243704	243578	243578	she	890	' How ? No bad speculation for him . She must have a handsome jointure ; but what are your grounds ? '
243705	243780	243578	243578	she	890	' Everything . Do n't you remember he would not go to the marriage ? He mentions her almost like a saint ; ca n't hear her name from any one else — keeps her letter to open alone , is more revived by it than by anything else . Ah ! depend upon it , it was to avoid her , poor fellow , that he refused to go to Venice with them . '
243781	243796	243825	243826	his sister	890	' Their going to nurse him is not as if Sir Guy suspected it . '
243797	243819	243578	243578	she	890	' I do n't suppose he did , nor Amy either . No one ever had so much power over himself . '
244517	244524	244526	244526	Mary	208	' Well ! how is she ? '
244530	244535	244536	244536	he	156	' Poor little dear ! '
244543	244551	244536	244536	he	156	' she looks very nice and comfortable . '
244552	244560	244495	244496	Mary Ross	208	' What , you have seen her ? '
244561	244570	244536	244536	he	156	' I am this moment leaving her room . '
244571	244581	244495	244496	Mary Ross	208	' She is going on well , I hope ? '
244582	244593	244595	244595	Charles	156	' Perfectly well . There is one comfort at least , '
244604	244617	244595	244595	Charles	156	' Dear Amy ! And the babe — did you see it ? '
244618	244667	244669	244669	Charles	156	' Yes ; the little creature was lying by her , and she put her hand on it , and gave one of those smiles that are so terribly like his ; but I could not have spoken about it for the world . Such fools we be ! '
244678	244683	244669	244669	Charles	156	' It is healthy ? '
244684	244727	244729	244729	Charles	156	' All a baby ought to be , they say , all that could be expected of it , except the not being of the right sort , and if Amy does not mind that , I do n't know who should , '
244751	244760	244731	244731	himself	156	' Then you think she is not disappointed ? '
244761	244780	244729	244729	Charles	156	' Certainly not . The first thing she said when she was told it was a girl was , '
244782	244786	244731	244731	himself	156	'm so glad ! '
244831	244843	244844	244844	You	5168	' There was a silence , first broken by Charles saying , '

246170	246219	246042	246042	I	0	' The rarity of such a message from you may enable me . I was lying here alone , and received the collected love of five Harpers to convey upstairs , all which I forgot ; though in its transit by Arnaud and his French , it had become '
246232	246552	246229	246230	Mrs. Edmonstone	159	'' Charles had not talked so like himself for months ; and Mary felt that Amabel 's child , if she had disappointed some expectations , had come like a spring blossom , to cheer Hollywell , after its long winter of sorrow and anxiety . She seemed to have already been received as a messenger to comfort them for the loss , greatest of all to her , poor child , though she would never know how great . Next Mary wondered what kind of letter Charles would indite , and guessed it would be all the kinder for the outpouring he had made to her , the only person with whom he ventured to indulge in a comfortable abuse of Philip , since his good sense taught him that , ending as affairs must it was the only wise way to make the best of it with father , mother , and Charlotte , all quite sufficiently disposed to regard Philip with aversion without his help . Philip was at breakfast with the Henleys , on the following morning , a Sunday,—or rather , sitting at the breakfast - table when the letters were brought in . Mrs. Henley , pretending to be occupied with her own , had an eager , watchful eye on her brother , as one was placed before him . She knew Mr. Edmonstone 's writing , but was restrained from exclaiming by her involuntary deference for her brother . He flushed deep red one moment , then turned deadly pale ; his hand , when first he raised it , trembled , but then became firm , as if controlled by the force of his resolution . He broke the black seal , drew out the letter , paused another instant , unfolded it , glanced at it , pushed his chair from the table , and hastened to the door . '
246565	246601	246602	246603	Poor fellow	5179	' she exclaimed , rising to follow him . He turned round , threw the letter on the table , and with a sign that forbade her to come with him , left the room . '
246615	246626	246610	246613	That poor young creature	4443	' said she , catching up the letter for explanation . '

246832	246839	246829	246829	she	347	' Surely you mistook the letter ! '

247754	247873	247749	247749	Hollywell	10	' My dear Philip , — I believe my father wrote to you in haste yesterday ; but I am sure you will be anxious for further accounts , and when there is good news there is satisfaction in conveying it . I know you will be glad to hear our affairs are very prosperous ; and Amy , whom I have just been visiting , is said by the authorities to be going on as well as possible . She begs me to tell you of her welfare , and to assure you that she is particularly pleased to have a daughter ; or , perhaps , it will be more satisfactory to have her own words . '
247933	248025	248026	248028	C. M. Edmonstone	350	' You know Amy never said a word but in all sincerity , so you may trust her ; and I add my testimony that she is in placid spirits , and may well be glad to escape the cares of Redclyffe . My father says he desired Markham to write to you on the business matters . I hope the seabreezes may do you good . All the party here are well ; but I see little of them now , all the interest of the house is upstairs.—Your affectionate , '
248030	248054	248026	248028	C. M. Edmonstone	350	' P.S. The baby is very small , but so plump and healthy , that no one attempts to be uneasy about her . '

248593	248615	248578	248578	she	516	' Why , sir , what a turn you give me ! How bad you be looking , to be sure ! '
248723	248737	248764	248764	She	516	' Sure , sure , it must have been very bad for you , '
248859	248865	248867	248867	Philip	454	' The Sunday before Michaelmas ! '
249156	249490	249127	249127	his	616	' It had been his father 's one reproof . He had thought it unjust and unreasonable , and turned away impatiently to be caressed and admired by Margaret . His real feelings had been told to her , because she flattered them and shared them ; he had been reserved and guarded with the father who would have perceived and repressed that ambition and the self - sufficiency which he himself had never known to exist , nor regarded as aught but sober truth . It had been his bane , that he had been always too sensible to betray outwardly his self - conceit , in any form that could lead to its being noticed . He opened the church door , closed it behind him , and locked himself in . He came up to the communion rail , where he had knelt for the first time twelve years ago , confident in himself , and unconscious of the fears with which his father 's voice was trembling in the intensity of his prayer for one in whom there was no tangible evil , and whom others thought a pattern of all that could be desired by the fondest hopes . He knelt down , with bowed head , and hands clasped . Assuredly , if his father could have beheld him then , it would have been with rejoicing . He would not have sorrowed that that robust frame was wasted , and great strength brought low ; that the noble features were worn , the healthful cheek pale , and the powerful intellect clouded and weakened ; he would hardly have mourned for the cruel grief and suffering , such would have been his joy that the humble , penitent , obedient heart had been won at last . Above all , he would have rejoiced that the words that most soothed that wounded spirit were,—'A broken and contrite heart , O God , Thou wilt not despise . '
249686	249748	249682	249682	she	516	' Well , if it be so , I am glad of it , but he said never a word of it to me , and it is my belief he would give all the money as ever was coined , to have the poor young gentleman back again . Depend upon it , he hates the very sound of it . '

250085	250356	250081	250083	Ph . Morville	517	' He ardently watched for a reply . He could not endure the idea of receiving it where Margaret 's eyes could scan the emotion he could now only conceal by a visible rigidity of demeanour , and he daily went himself to the post - office , but in vain . He received nothing but business letters , and among them one from Markham , with as much defiance and dislike in its style as could be shown in a perfectly formal , proper letter . Till he had referred to Lady Morville , he would not make any demonstration towards Redclyffe , and evaded all his sister 's questions as to what he was doing about it , and when he should take measures for leaving the army , or obtaining a renewal of the baronetcy . Anxiety made him look daily more wretchedly haggard ; the doctor was at fault , Mrs. Henley looked sagacious , while his manner became so dry and repellent that visitors went away moralizing on the absurdity of nuvoeaux riches taking so much state on them . He wondered how soon he might venture to write to Amabel , on whom alone he could depend ; but he felt it a sort of profanity to disturb her . He had nearly given up his visits to the post in despair , when one morning he beheld what never failed to bring some soothing influence , namely , the fair pointed characters he had not dared to hope for . He walked quickly into the promenade , sat down , and read : — '
250362	250640	250357	250357	Hollywell	10	' My dear Philip , — Papa does not answer your letter , because he says speaking is better than writing , and we hope you are well enough to come to us before Sunday week . I hope to take our dear little girl to be christened on that day , and I want you to be so kind as to be her godfather . I ask it of you , not only in my own name , but in her father 's , for I am sure it is what he would choose . Her aunt Laura and Mary Ross are to be her godmothers . I hope you will not think me very foolish and fanciful for naming her Mary Verena , in remembrance of our old readings of Sintram . She is a very healthy , quiet creature , and I am getting on very well . I am writing from the dressing - room , and I expect to be down stairs in a few days . If you do not dislike it very much , could you be so kind as to call upon Miss Wellwood , and pay little Marianne Dixon 's quarter for me ? It is £ 10 , and it will save trouble if you would do it ; besides that , I should like to hear of her and the little girl . I am sorry to hear you are not better,—perhaps coming here may do you good.—Four o'clock . I have been keeping my letter in hopes of persuading papa to put in a note , but he says he had rather send a message that '

251121	251171	251119	251119	Philip	454	' Ah ! my dear brother , you betrayed yourself . You need not be disconcerted ; only a sister could see the real cause of your want of spirits . Your manner at each mention of her , your anxiety , coupled with your resolute avoidance of her — '

251256	251261	251250	251251	Mrs. Henley	232	' Are you engaged ? '
251274	251327	251271	251271	she	232	' If you have not gone too far to recede , only consider before you take any rash step . You come into this property without ready money , you will find endless claims , and if you marry at once and without fortune , you will never be clear from difficulties . '
251328	251333	251334	251334	he	454	' I have considered , '
251354	251362	251363	251363	she	232	' You are positively committed , then ! '
251369	251386	251363	251363	she	232	' Oh , Philip ! I did not think you would have married for mere beauty . '
251387	251398	251400	251400	Philip	454	' I can hear no more discussion on this point , '
251800	251802	251794	251794	Marianne	208	' yes '
251804	251807	251808	251808	He	454	' no . '
251922	251931	251906	251906	she	208	' My love to dear little cousin Mary . '
252298	252309	252311	252311	she	234	' I thought you would like just to see baby , '
252531	252543	252516	252516	he	454	' Amabel , you must let me do this child justice . '
252554	252567	252569	252569	he	454	' I will not delay in taking steps for restoring her inheritance , '
252590	252601	252569	252569	he	454	' O Philip , you are not thinking of that ! '
252602	252609	252550	252550	he	454	' It is to be done . '
252610	252623	252625	252625	Amy	425	' You would not be so unkind to this poor little girl , '
252645	252662	252663	252664	The nurse	4574	' Pray put it out of your head directly , for it would be very wrong . '
252703	252779	252697	252697	his	454	' You must listen to me , Amy , and not allow any scruples to prevent you from permitting your child to be restored to her just rights . You must see that the estate has come to me by circumstances such that no honest man could be justified in retaining it . The entail was made to exclude females , only because of the old Lady Granard . It is your duty to consent . '
252780	252791	252793	252793	Amabel	234	' The property has always gone in the male line , '
252795	252852	252853	252853	He	4576	' There never was such a state of things . Old Sir Guy could never have thought of entailing it away from his own descendant on a distant cousin . It would be wrong of me to profit by these unforeseen contingencies , and you ought not , in justice to your child , to object . '
252941	252950	252936	252936	Guy	150	' and the tears rose in her eyes . '
253127	253140	253111	253111	you	454	' He almost groaned—'If you could guess what a burden it is . '
253141	253165	253167	253167	she	234	' Ah ! but you must carry it , not throw it down on such hands as mine and that tiny baby 's , '
253171	253185	253167	253167	she	234	' It would have been the same if it had been a boy . '
253186	253240	253111	253111	you	454	' Yes ; then I must have done the best I could , and there would have been an end to look to , but I am so glad to be spared . And you are so fit for it , and will make it turn to so much use to every one . '
253241	253258	253260	253260	Philip	454	' I do n't feel as if I should ever be of use to any one , '
253269	253275	253277	253277	she	234	' Your head is aching , '
253281	253290	253292	253292	he	454	' It always does , more or less , '
253300	253331	253292	253292	he	454	' I am so sorry . Has it been so ever since you were ill ? But you are better ? You look better than when I saw you last . '
253332	253430	253277	253277	she	234	' I am better on the whole , but I doubt whether I shall ever be as strong as I used to be . That ought to make me hesitate , even if'—then came a pause , while he put his hand over his face , and seemed struggling with irrepressible emotion ; and after all he was obliged to take two walks to the window before he could recover composure , and could ask in a voice which he tried to make calm and steady , though his face was deeply flushed—'Amy , how is Laura ? '
253431	253437	253439	253439	Amabel	234	' She is very well , '
253441	253457	253439	253439	Amabel	234	' Only you must not be taken by surprise if you see her looking thinner . '
253458	253470	253472	253472	he	4581	' And she has trusted — she has endured through all ? '
253478	253482	253472	253472	he	4581	' O yes ! '
253483	253495	253277	253277	she	234	' And they — your father and mother — can forgive ? '
253496	253563	253564	253564	He	4581	' They do — they have . But , Philip , it was one of the things I came down to say to you . I do n't think you must expect papa to begin about it himself . You know he does not like awkwardness , though he will be very glad when once it is done , and ready to meet you half way . '
253576	253591	253573	253573	Amabel	234	' Laura is out of doors . She and Charlotte take very long walks . '
253592	253616	253617	253617	he	4581	' And is she really strong and well , or is it that excited overdoing of employment that I first set her upon ? '
253622	253640	253642	253642	Amabel	234	' She is perfectly well , and to be busy has been a great help to her , '
253644	253725	253642	253642	Amabel	234	' It was a great comfort that we did not know how ill you had been at Corfu , till the worst was over . Eveleen only mentioned it when you were better . I was very anxious , for I had some fears from the note that you sent by Arnaud . I am very glad to see you safe here , for I have felt all along that we forsook you ; but I could not help it . '
253726	253751	253760	253760	Amy	425	' I am very glad you did not stay . The worst of all would have been that you should have run any risk . '
253752	253758	253760	253760	Amy	425	' There is the carriage , '
253762	253782	253760	253760	Amy	425	' Mamma and Charlie have been to Broadstone . They thought they might meet you by the late train . '
254139	254150	254152	254152	he	454	' I am sorry to see you so pulled down , '
254154	254181	254152	254152	he	454	' We must try if we can doctor you better than they did at St. Mildred 's . Are you getting on , do you think ? '
254209	254237	254198	254198	his	454	' Thank you , I am growing stronger ; but as long as I can not get rid of this headache , I am good for nothing . '
254238	254249	254251	254251	Charles	156	' You have had a long spell of illness indeed , '
254280	254281	254308	254308	they	4597	' '
254302	254303	254308	254308	they	4597	' '
254357	254358	254308	254308	they	4597	' '
254365	254371	254308	254308	they	4597	' said Philip , earnestly . '
254382	254386	254372	254372	She	234	' said Charles . '
254396	254397	254400	254400	she	234	' '
254407	254408	254400	254400	she	234	' '
254465	254477	254445	254445	mamma	5168	' Philip lapsed into thought , and presently said , abruptly , '
254493	254494	254489	254489	You	454	' '
254498	254532	254489	254489	You	454	' was all Charles 's reply , and no more was said till Charles rose , saying it was time to dress . Philip was about to help him , but he answered , '
254562	255257	254550	254550	I	0	' Charles certainly did get on with less difficulty than heretofore , but it was more because he wanted to spare Philip fatigue than because he disdained assistance , that he chose to go alone . Moreover , he did what he had never done for any one before — he actually hopped the whole length of the passage , beyond his own door , to do the honours of Philip 's room , and took a degree of pains for his comfort that seemed too marvellous to be true in one who had hitherto only lived to be attended on . By the time he had settled Philip , the rest of the party had come home , and he found himself wanted in the dressing - room to help his mother to encourage his father to enter on the conversation with Philip in the evening , for poor Mr. Edmonstone was in such a worry and perplexity , that the whole space till the dinner - bell rang was insufficient to console him in . Laura , meanwhile , was with Amabel , who was trying to cheer her fluttering spirits and nerves , which , after having been so long harassed , gave way entirely at the moment of meeting Philip again . How would he regard her after her weakness in betraying him for want of self - command ? Might he not be wishing to be free of one who had so disappointed him , and only persisting in the engagement from a sense of honour ? The confidence in his affection , which had hitherto sustained her , was failing ; and not all Amabel could say would reassure her . No one could judge of him but herself ; his words were so cautious , and he had so much command over himself , that nobody could guess . Of course he felt bound to her ; but if she saw one trace of his being only influenced by honour and pity , she would release him , and he should never see the struggle . She had worked herself up into almost a certainty that so it would be , and Amabel was afraid she would not be fit to go down to dinner ; but the sound of the bell , and the necessity of moving , seemed to restore the habit of external composure in a moment . She settled her countenance , and left the room . Charlotte , meantime , had been dressing alone , and raging against Philip , declaring she could never bear to speak to him , and that if she was Amy she would never have chosen him for a godfather . And to think of his marrying just like a good hero in a book , and living very happy ever after ! To be sure , she was sorry for poor Laura ; but it was all very wrong , and now they would be rewarded ! How could Charlie be so provoking as to talk about his sorrow ! She hoped he was sorry ; and as to his illness , it served him right . All this Charlotte communicated to Bustle ; but Bustle had heard some mysterious noise , and insisted on going to investigate the cause ; and Charlotte , finding her own domain dark and cold , and private conferences going on in Amabel 's apartment and the dressing - room , was fain to follow him downstairs , as soon as her toilette was complete , only hoping Philip would keep out of the way . But , behold , there he was , and even Bustle was propitiated , for she found him , his nose on Philip 's knee , looking up in his face , and wagging his tail , while Philip stroked and patted him , and could hardly bear the appealing expression of the eyes , that , always wistful , now seemed to every one to be looking for his master . To see this attention to Bustle won Charlotte over in a moment . '
255271	255416	255267	255269	dear old Bustle	169	' came in a breath , and they were both making much of the dog , when she amicably asked if he had seen the baby , and became eager in telling about the christening . The dinner - bell brought every one down but Amabel . The trembling hands of Philip and Laura met for a moment , and they were in the dining - room . Diligently and dutifully did Charles and Mrs. Edmonstone keep up the conversation ; the latter about her shopping , the former about the acquaintances who had come to speak to him as he sat in the carriage . As soon as possible , Mrs. Edmonstone left the dining - room , then Laura flew up again to the dressing - room , sank down on a foot - stool by Amabel 's side , and exclaiming , '
255426	255660	255267	255269	dear old Bustle	169	' burst into a flood of tears . The change had been a shock for which Laura had not been prepared . Amy , who had seen him look so much worse , had not thought of it , and it overcame Laura more than all her anxieties lest his love should be forfeited . She sobbed inconsolably over the alteration ; and it was long before Amabel could get her to hear that his face was much less thin now , and that he was altogether much stronger ; it was fatigue and anxiety to - night , and to - morrow he would be better . Laura proceeded to brood over her belief that his altered demeanour , his settled melancholy , his not seeking her eye , his cold shake of the hand , all arose from the diminution of his love , and his dislike to be encumbered with a weak , foolish wife , with whom he had entangled himself when he deemed her worthy of him . She dwelt on all this in silence , as she sat at her sister 's feet , and Amy left her to think , only now and then giving some caress to her hair or cheek , and at each touch the desolate waste of life that poor Laura was unfolding before herself was rendered less dreary by the thought , '
255673	255847	255668	255668	she	5869	' Then she half envied Amy , who had lost her dearest by death , and held his heart fast to the last ; not , like herself , doomed to see the love decay for which she had endured so long — decay at the very moment when the suspense was over . Laura might justly have envied Amabel , though for another reason ; it was because in her cup there was no poison of her own infusing . There she stayed till Charlotte came to summon her to tea saying the gentlemen , except Charles , were still in the dining - room . They had remained sitting over the fire for a considerable space , waiting for each other to begin , Mr. Edmonstone irresolute , Philip striving to master his feelings , and to prevent increasing pain and confusion from making him forget what he intended to say . At last , Mr. Edmonstone started up , pulled out his keys , took a candle , and said , '
255860	255861	255853	255853	I'll	4606	' '
255865	255884	255863	255863	you	4607	' said Philip , also rising , but only because he could not sit while his uncle stood . '
255901	255902	255894	255894	I	0	' '
255910	255911	255894	255894	I	0	' '
255938	255939	255924	255924	you	4607	' '
255947	255955	255944	255944	I	0	' said Mr. Edmonstone , moving uneasily . '
255966	255975	255962	255962	I	0	' Mr. Edmonstone could not endure the apology . '
255980	255987	255962	255962	I	0	' he broke in , nervously , '
256022	256045	256013	256013	I	0	' That Captain Morville should live to be thankful for being forgiven , in consideration of Mr. Edmonstone 's having been young ! '
256061	256062	256013	256013	I	0	' '
256153	256821	256151	256151	Philip	454	' Love - making was such a charming sight to Mr. Edmonstone , that having once begun to look on Philip and Laura as a pair of lovers , he could not help being delighted , and forgetting , as well as forgiving , all that had been wrong . They did not , however , exactly answer his ideas ; Laura did not once look up , and Philip , instead of going boldly to take the place next her , sat down , holding his hand to his forehead , as if too much overpowered by indisposition to think of anything else . Such was in great measure the case ; he was very much fatigued with the journey , and these different agitating scenes had increased the pain in his head to a violent degree ; besides which , feeling that his aunt still regarded him as she did at Recoara , he could not bear to make any demonstration towards Laura before her ; lest she might think it a sort of triumphant disregard of her just displeasure . Poor Laura saw in it both severe suffering and dislike to her , and the more she understood from her father 's manner what had passed in the other room , the more she honoured him for the sacrifice he was making of himself . Mrs. Edmonstone waited on the headache with painful attention , but they all felt that the only thing to be done for the two poor things was to let them come to an explanation ; so Charlotte was sent to bed , her mother went up to Amy , Charles carried off his father to the study , and they found themselves alone . Laura held down her face , and struggled to make her palpitating heart and dry tongue suffer her to begin the words to which she had wound herself up . Philip raised his hand from his eyes as the door shut , then rose up , and fixed them on Laura . She too looked up , as if to begin ; their eyes met , and they understood all . He stepped towards her , and held out his hands . The next moment both hers were clasped in his — he had bent down and kissed her brow . No words of explanation passed between them . Laura knew he was her own , and needed no assurance that her misgivings had been vain . There was a start of extreme joy , such as she had known twice before , but it could be only for a moment while he looked so wretchedly unwell . It did but give her the right to attend to him . The first thing she said was to beg him to lie down on the sofa ; her only care was to make him comfortable with cushions , and he was too entirely worn out to say anything he had intended , capable only of giving himself up to the repose of knowing her entirely his own , and of having her to take care of him . There he lay on the sofa , with his eyes shut , and Laura 's hand in his , while she sat beside him , neither of them speaking ; and , excepting that she withdrew her hand , neither moved when the others returned . Mrs. Edmonstone compassionated him , and showed a great deal of solicitude about him , trying hard to regard him as she used to do , yet unable to bring back the feeling , and therefore , do what she would , failing to wear its semblance . Laura , sad , anxious , and restless , had no relief till she went to wish her sister good night . Amable , who was already in bed , stretched out her hand with a sweet look , beaming with affection and congratulation . '
256835	256839	256822	256822	You	4612	' said she . '
256847	256851	256822	256822	You	4612	' said Laura . '
256865	256866	256822	256822	You	4612	' '
256874	256875	256822	256822	You	4612	' '
256891	256892	256893	256893	My	0	' '
256896	256904	256893	256893	My	0	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , coming in , '
256931	256932	256921	256921	She	452	' '
256958	256997	256953	256953	you	454	' whispered Amabel with her parting kiss ; and Laura went away , better able to hope , to pray , and to rest , than she could have thought possible when she left the drawing - room . '
257002	257009	256953	256953	you	454	' said Mrs. Edmonstone , sighing ; '
257018	257019	256953	256953	you	454	' '
257026	257027	256953	256953	you	454	' '
257130	257131	257124	257124	I	0	' '
257146	257147	257143	257144	dearest mamma	4620	' '
257156	257176	257154	257154	Amy	452	' then as Amy put back the coverings to show the little face nestled to sleep on her bosom , '
257203	257541	257542	257544	Guy 's baby	4624	' Mrs. Edmonstone looked for a moment , while trying to check the tears that came at the thought of the night , one brief year ago , when she left Amy sleeping in the light of the Easter moon . Yet the sense of peace and serenity that had then given especial loveliness to the maiden 's chamber on that night , was there still with the young widow . It was dim lamplight now that beamed on the portrait of her husband , casting on it the shade of the little wooden cross in front , while she was shaded by the white curtain drawn from her bed , round the infant 's little cot , so as to shut them both into the quiet twilight , where she lay with an expression of countenance that , though it was not sorrow , made Mrs. Edmonstone more ready to weep than if it had been ; so with her last good - night , she left her . And Amabel always liked to be shut in by herself , dearly as she loved them all , and mamma especially ; there was always something pleasnt in being able to return to her own world , to rest in the thoughts of her husband , and in the possession of the little unconscious creature that had come to inhabit that inner world of hers , the creature that was only his and hers . She had from the first always felt herself less lonely when quite alone , before with his papers , and now with his child ; and could Mrs. Edmonstone have seen her face , she would have wept and wondered more , as Amy fondled and hushed her babe , whispering to it fond words which she could never have uttered in the presence of any one who could understand them , and which had much of her extreme youthfulness in them . Not one was so often repeated or so endearing as '
257553	257788	257542	257544	Guy 's baby	4624	' It did not mean half so much when she called it her baby ; and she loved to tell the little one that her father had been the best and the dearest , but he was gone away , and would she be contented to be loving and good with only her mother to take care of her , and tell her , as well as she could , what a father hers was , when she was old enough to know about him ? To - night . Amy told her much in that soft , solemn , murmuring tone , about what was to befall her to - morrow , and the great blessings to be given to her , and how the poor little fatherless one would be embraced in the arms of His mercy , and received by her great Father in heaven;—'Ay , and brought nearer to your own papa , and know him in some inner way , and he will know his little child then , for you will be as good and pure and bright as he , and you will belong to the great communion of saints to - morrow , you precious one , and be so much nearer to him as you will be so much better than I. Oh ! baby , if we can but both endure to the end ! '
257863	257869	257871	257871	Mary	208	' Is Captain Morville come ? '
257873	257897	257871	257871	Mary	208	' No , I can not guess by Laura 's impassive face . Never mind , Charles will tell me all between services . '
257942	257961	257921	257921	Charlotte	277	' It is all made up now , Mary , and I really am very sorry for Philip . '
258005	258008	258010	258010	Charles	156	' Yes , '
258033	258079	258010	258010	Charles	156	' if it is any satisfaction to you to have a good opinion of your fellow - sponsor , I assure you that I am converted to Amy 's opinion . I do believe the black dog is off his back for good and all . '
258080	258089	258091	258091	Mary	208	' I never saw any one more changed , '
258093	258097	258099	258099	Charles	156	' Regularly tamed , '
258101	258176	258099	258099	Charles	156	' He is something more like his old self to - day than last night , and yet not much . He was perfectly overpowered then — so knocked up that there was no judging of him . Today he has all his sedateness and scrupulous attention , but all like a shadow of former times — not a morsel of sententiousness , and seeming positively grateful to be treated in the old fashion . '
258177	258191	258010	258010	Charles	156	' He looks very thin and pale . Do you think him recovered ? '
258192	258199	258201	258201	Charles	156	' A good way from it , '
258203	258246	258201	258201	Charles	156	' He is pretty well to - day , comparatively , though that obstinate headache hangs about him . If this change last longer than that and his white looks , I shall not even grudge him the sponsorship Amy owed me . '

260375	260758	260761	260761	doctor	6828	' She could not but hear such words with thrills of rejoicing affection ; and on they walked , Laura trembling and struck with sorrow at the depth of repentance he now and then disclosed , though not in the least able to fathom it , thinking it all his nobleness of mind , justifying him to herself , idolizing him too much to own he had ever been wrong ; yet the innate power of tact and sympathy teaching her no longer to combat his selfreproaches , and repeat his former excuses , but rather to say something soothing and caressing , or put in some not of thankfulness and admiration of Amy and Guy . This was the best thing she could do for him , as she was not capable , like Amy , of acknowledging that his repentance was well - founded . She was a nurse , not a physician , to the wounded spirit ; but a very good and gentle nurse she was , and the thorough enjoyment of her affection and sympathy , the opening into confidence , and the freedom from doubt and suspense , were comforts that were doing him good every hour . The christening party consisted only of the Rosses and Dr. Mayerne , who had joined them at East Hill church , and walked home with Mr. Edmonstone . They could not have been without him , so grateful were they for his kindness all through their anxious winter , and Mr. Edmonstone was well pleased to tell him on the way home that they might look to having a wedding in the family ; it had been a very long attachment , constancy as good as a story , and he could all along have told what was the matter , when mamma was calling in the doctor to account for Laura 's looking pale . The doctor was not surprised at the news , for perhaps he , too , had had some private theory about those pale looks ; but knowing pretty well the sentiments Charles had entertained the winter before last , he was curious to find out how he regarded this engagement . Charles spoke of it in the most ready , cordial way . '
260804	260805	260795	260795	we	4671	' '
260813	260818	260795	260795	we	4671	' said Dr. Mayerne . '
260842	262688	260826	260826	One	5249	' When Mrs. Edmonstone came in , the doctor was a little taken aback . He thought her mind must be with poor Sir Guy , and was afraid the lovers had been in such haste as to pain Lady Morville ; for there was a staidness and want of épanchement du coeur of answering that was very unlike her usual warm manner . At dinner , Mr. Edmonstone was in high spirits , delighted at Amy 's recovery , happy to have a young man about the house again , charmed to see two lovers together , pleased that Laura should be mistress of Redclyffe , since it could not belong to Amy 's child ; altogether , as joyous as ever . His wife , being at ease about Amy , did her best to smile , and even laugh , though sad at heart all the time , as she missed the father from the christening feast , and thought how happy she had been in that far different reunion last year . It might be the same with Charles ; but the outward effect was exhibited in lively nonsense ; Charlotte 's spirits were rising fast , and only Philip and Laura themselves were grave and silent , she , the more so , because she was disappointed to find that the one walk back from East Hill , much as he had enjoyed it , had greatly tired Philip . However , the others talked enough without them ; and Mr. Edmonstone was very happy , drinking the health of Miss Morville , and himself carrying a bit of the christening cake to the mamma in the drawing - room . There sat Amabel by the fire , knowing that from henceforth she must exert herself to take part in the cheerfulness of the house , and willing to join the external rejoicing in her child 's christening , or at least not to damp it by remaining upstairs . Yet any one but Mr. Edmonstone would have seen more sadness than pleasure in the sweet smile with which she met and thanked him ; but they were cheerful tones in which she replied , and in her presence every thing was hushed and gentle , subdued , yet not mournful . The spirit of that evening was only recognised after it was past , and then it even grew fairer and sweeter in recollection , so as never to be forgotten by any of those who shared it . S. R. Philip 's marriage could not take place at once . No one said , but every one felt , that it must not be talked of tillthe end of Amabel 's first year of widowhood ; and in the meantime Philip remained at Hollywell , gaining strength every day , making more progress in one week , than he had done in six at St. Mildred 's , finding that , as his strength returned , his mind and memory regained their tone , and he was as capable as ever of applying to business , and , above all , much settled and comforted by some long conversations with Mr. Ross . Still he could not endure the thought of being at Redclyffe . The business connected with it was always performed with pain and dislike , and he shrank with suffering at every casual mention of his going thither . Mrs. Edmonstone began to wonder whether he could mean to linger at Hollywell all the summer , and Amabel had some fears that it would end in his neglecting Redclyffe , till a letter arrived from Lord Thorndale , saying that his brother , the member for Moorworth , had long been thinking of giving up his seat , and latterly had only waited in hopes that the succession of Redclyffe might come to Philip Morville . Moorworth was entirely under the Thorndale and Morville interest , and Lord Thorndale wrote to propose that Philip should come forward at once , inviting him to Thorndale instead of going to his own empty house . To be in parliament had been one of the favourite visions of Philip 's youth , and for that very reason he hesitated , taking it as one of the strange fulfilments of his desires that had become punishments . He could not but feel that as this unhappy load of wealth had descended on him , he was bound to make it as beneficial as he could to others , and , not seeking for rest or luxury , to stand in the gap where every good man and true was needed . But still he dreaded his old love of distinction . He disliked a London life for Laura , and he thought that , precarious as his health had become , it might expose her to much anxiety , since he was determined that if he undertook it at all he would never be an idle member . It ended in his referring the decision to Laura , who , disliking London , fearful for his health , eager for his glory , and reluctant to keep back such a champion from the battle , was much perplexed , only desirous to say what he wished , yet not able to make out what that might be . She carried her doubts to Charles and Amabel , who both pronounced that the thought of going to Redclyffe seemed far worse for him than any degree of employment — that occupation of the mind was the best thing for his spirits ; and ended by recommending that Dr. Mayerne should be consulted . He was of the same opinion . He said a man could hardly have two fevers following , and one of them upon the brain , without having reason to remember them . That his constitution had been seriously weakened , and there was an excitability of brain and nerves which made care requisite ; but depression of spirits was the chief thing to guard against , and a London life , provided he did not overwork himself , was better for him than solitude at Redclyffe . Accordingly Philip went to Thorndale , and was returned for Moorworth without opposition . Markham sent his nephew to transact business with him at Thorndale , for he could not bear to meet him himself , and while there was any prospect of his coming to Redclyffe , walked about in paroxysms of grunting and ill - humour . The report that Mr. Morville was engaged to the other Miss Edmonstone did but render him more furious , for he regarded it as a sort of outrage to Lady Morville 's feelings that a courtship should be carried on in the house with her . She was at present the object of all his devoted affection for the family , and he would not believe , but that she had been as much disappointed at the birth of her daughter , as he was himself . He would not say one word against Mr. Morville , but looked and growled enough to make Mr. Ashford afraid that the new squire would find him very troublesome . The Ashfords were in the state of mind themselves to think that Mr. Morville ought to be everything excellent to make up for succeeding Sir Guy ; but having a very high opinion of him to begin with , they were very sorry to find all Redclyffe set against him . In common with the parish , they were very anxious for the first report of his arrival , and at length he came . James Thorndale , as before , drove him thither , coming to the Ashfords while he was busy with Markham . He would not go up to the Park , he only went through some necessary business with Markham , and then walked down to the Cove , afterwards sitting for about ten minutes in Mrs. Ashford 's drawing - room . The result of the visit was that old James Robinson reported that the new squire took on as much about poor Sir Guy as any one could do , and turned as pale as if he had been going into a swoon , when he spoke his name and gave Ben his message . And as to poor Ben , the old man said , he regularly did cry like a child , and small blame to him , to hear that Sir Guy had took thought of him at such a time and so far away ; and he verily believed Ben could never take again to his bad ways , after such a message as that . Markham was gruff with the Robinsons for some time after , and was even heard to mutter something about worshipping the rising sun , an act of idolatry of which he could not be accused , since it was in the most grudging manner that he allowed , that Mr. Morville 's sole anxiety seemed to be to continue all Sir Guy had undertaken ; while Mrs. Ashford , on the other hand , was much affected by the account her cousin James had been giving her of the grief that he had suffered at Sir Guy 's death , his long illness , his loss of spirits , the reluctance he had shown to come here at all , and his present unconquerable dread of going to the Park . He was soon after in London , where , as far as could be judged in such early days , he seemed likely to distinguish himself according to the fondest hopes that Margaret or Laura could ever have entertained . Laura was only afraid he was overworking himself , especially as , having at present little command of ready money , he lived in a small lodging , kept no horse , and did not enter into society ; but she was reassured when he came to Hollywell for a day or two at Whitsuntide , not having indeed regained flesh or colour , but appearing quite well , in better spirits , and very eager about political affairs . All would have been right that summer , but that , as Philip observed , the first evening of his arrival , Amabel was not looking as well as she had done at the time of the christening . She had , just after it , tried her strength and spirits too much , and had ever since been not exactly unwell , but sad and weary , more dejected than ever before , unable to bear the sight of flowers or the sound of music , and evidently suffering much under the recurrence of the season , which had been that of her great happiness — the summer sunshine , the long evenings , the nightingales '

267055	267066	267068	267068	Mary	208	' That 's what comes of living with good company , '
267089	267094	267096	267096	Charles	156	' Charlotte , of course '

267113	267118	267120	267120	Amabel	234	' Only Mr. Markham , '
267122	267140	267120	267120	Amabel	234	' about the winding up of our business together , I suppose . What does Charlotte say ? '

267367	267406	267362	267363	Mr. Markham	157	' said Amabel , hastily unfolding her letter , which was , as she expected , about the executor 's business , but glancing on to the end she exclaimed,—'Ah ! here it is . Listen , Charlie . '
267510	267522	267533	267533	Charles	156	' Poor fellow ! Redclyffe has been too much for him . '
267523	267531	267533	267533	Charles	156	' Over - worked , I suppose , '
267535	267549	267533	267533	Charles	156	' I thought he was coming it pretty strong these last few weeks . '
267550	267577	267578	267578	She	4799	' Not even writing to Laura ! How very bad he must be ! I will write at once to ask Mr. Markham for more particulars . '
267731	267734	267736	267736	Charles	156	' Hem ! '
267738	267747	267736	267736	Charles	156	' I ca n't say it sounds comfortable . '
267748	267756	267758	267758	Amy	425	' It is just as I feared ! '
267760	267790	267758	267758	Amy	425	' Great excitability of brain and nerve , Dr. Mayerne said . All the danger of a brain fever again ! Poor Laura ! What is to be done ? '
267795	267808	267810	267810	Amabel	234	' It is for want of some one to talk to him , '
267812	267874	267810	267810	Amabel	234	' I know how he broods over his sad recollections , and Redclyffe must make it so much worse . If mamma and Laura were but at home to go to him , it might save him , and it would be fearful for him to have another illness , reduced as he is . How I wish he was here ! '
267875	267884	267886	267886	Charles	156	' He can not come , I suppose , '
267888	267896	267886	267886	Charles	156	' or he would be in Ireland . '
267897	267943	267810	267810	Amabel	234	' Yes . How well Guy knew when he said it would be worse for him than for me ! How I wish I could do something now to make up for running away from him in Italy . If I was but at Redclyffe ! '
267944	267951	267953	267953	Charles	156	' Do you really wish it ? '
267957	267968	267953	267953	Charles	156	' Yes , if I could do him any good . '
267969	267975	267810	267810	Amabel	234	' Would you go there ? '
267976	267989	267810	267810	Amabel	234	' If I had but papa or mamma to go with me . '
267990	268000	267953	267953	Charles	156	' Do you think I should do as well ? '
268001	268004	267810	267810	Amabel	234	' Charlie ! '
268005	268039	267810	267810	Amabel	234	' If you think there would be any use in it , and choose to take the trouble of lugging me about the country , I do n't see why you should not . '
268040	268066	268068	268068	Amabel	234	' Oh ! Charlie , how very kind ! How thankful poor Laura will be to you ! I do believe it will save him ! '
268072	268082	268068	268068	Amabel	234	' But Amy,'—he paused—'shall you like to see Redclyffe ? '
268083	268091	268093	268093	she	234	' Oh ! that is no matter , '
268097	268133	268093	268093	she	234	' I had rather see after Philip than anything . I told you how he was made my charge , you know . And Laura ! Only will it not be too tiring for you ? '
268134	268158	267810	267810	Amabel	234	' I ca n't see how it should hurt me . But I forget , what is to be done about your daughter ? '
268159	268171	268173	268173	Amy	425	' I do n't know what harm it could do her , '
268177	268213	268173	268173	Amy	425	' Mrs. Gresham brought a baby of only three months old from Scotland the other day , and she is six . It surely can not hurt her , but we will ask Dr. Mayerne . '
268214	268231	267810	267810	Amabel	234	' Mamma will never forgive us if we do n't take the doctor into our councils . '
268232	268287	267810	267810	Amabel	234	' Arnaud can manage for us . We would sleep in London , and go on by an early train , and we can take our — I mean my — carriage , for the journey after the railroad . It would not be too much for you . How soon could we go ? '
268288	268294	268296	268296	Charles	156	' The sooner the better , '
268298	268332	268296	268296	Charles	156	' If we are to do him any good , it must be speedily , or it will be a case of shutting the stable - door . Why not to - morrow ? '
268372	268398	268360	268360	they	4804	' Charles was still wondering whether it was a dream , when the first thing he heard in the court below his window was , — '
268418	268419	268420	268420	They	4804	' '
268427	268433	268420	268420	They	4804	' answered William 's voice . '
268473	268517	268470	268471	a Bradshaw	4809	' Reality , indeed , thought Charles , marvelling at his sister , and his elastic spirits throwing him into the project with a sort of enjoyment , partaking of the pleasure of being of use , the spirit of enterprise , and the '
268519	268623	268666	268666	you	6828	' of starting independently on an expedition unknown to all the family . He met Amabel with a smile that showed both were determined . He undertook to announce the plan to his mother , and she said she would write to tell Mr. Markham that as far as could be reckoned on two such frail people , they would be at Redclyffe the next evening , and he must use his own discretion about giving Mr. Morville the note which she enclosed . Dr. Mayerne came in time for breakfast , and the letter from Markham was at once given to him . '
268634	268638	268632	268632	doctor	6828	' said Charles . '
268674	268675	268666	268666	you	6828	' '
268687	268698	268666	268666	you	6828	' said the doctor , looking only at the latter . '
268792	268882	268897	268898	Dr. Mayerne	206	' So spoke the doctor , thinking only of the patient , till looking up at the pair he was dismissing to such a charge , the helpless , crippled Charles , unable to cross the room without crutches , and Amabel , her delicate face and fragile figure in her widow 's mourning , looking like a thing to be pitied and nursed with the tenderest care , with that young child , too , he broke off and said,—'But you do n't mean you are in earnest ? '
268883	268891	268893	268893	Charles	156	' Never more so in our lives , '
268912	268929	268908	268908	she	234	' Yes , that we are , if you think it safe for Charles and baby . '
268930	268946	268893	268893	Charles	156	' Is there no one else to go ? What 's become of his sister ? '
268947	268953	268955	268955	Charles	156	' That would never do , '
268957	268964	268966	268966	he	156	' that is not the question , '
268971	268984	268986	268987	the doctor	5336	' Well , I do n't see why it should not succeed , '
268989	269000	268986	268987	the doctor	5336	' or how you can any of you damage yourselves . '
269001	269005	269007	269007	Amy	425	' And baby ? '
269009	269020	269022	269023	the doctor	5336	' What should happen to her , do you think ? '
269032	269070	269022	269023	the doctor	5336	' Unless you leave her behind in the carriage , I do n't see what harm she could come to , and even then , if you direct her properly , she will come safe to hand . '
269098	269113	269115	269115	Charles	156	' There goes one of the smallest editions of the wonders of the world ! '
269124	269136	269115	269115	Charles	156	' You do n't think it will do her any harm ? '
269137	269195	269076	269076	she	234	' Not if she wishes it . I have long thought a change , a break , would be the best thing for her — poor child ! I should have sent her to the seaside , if you had been more moveable , and if I had not seen every fuss about her made it worse . '
269196	269209	269211	269211	Charles	156	' That 's what I call being a reasonable and valuable doctor , '
269213	269256	269211	269211	Charles	156	' If you had routed the poor little thing out to the sea , she would have only pined the more . But suppose the captain turns out too bad for her management , for old Markham seems in a proper taking ? '
269257	269272	269076	269076	she	234	' Hm ! No , I do n't expect it is come to that . '
269305	269596	269294	269294	I	0	' The doctor was wanted for another private interview , in which to assure Amabel that there was no danger for Charles , and then , after promising to come to Redclyffe if there was occasion , and engaging to write and tell Mrs. Edmonstone they had his consent , he departed to meet them by - and - by at the station , and put Charles into the carriage . A very busy morning followed ; Amabel arranged household affairs as befitted the vice - queen ; took care that Charles 's comforts were provided for ; wrote many a note ; herself took down Guy 's picture , and laid it in her box , before Anne commenced her packing ; and lastly , walked down to the village to take leave of Alice Lamsden . Just as the last hues of sunset were fading , on the following evening , Lady Morville and Charles Edmonstone were passing from the moor into the wooded valley of Redclyffe . Since leaving Moorworth not a word had passed . Charles sat earnestly watching his sister ; though there was too much crape in the way for him to see her face , and she was perfectly still , so that all he could judge by was the close , rigid clasping together of the hands , resting on the sleeping infant 's white mantle . Each spot recalled to him some description of Guy 's , the church tower , the school with the two large new windows , the park wall , the rising ground within . What was she feeling ? He did not dare to address her , till at the lodge - gate , he exclaimed — '
269601	269702	269599	269599	Markham	157	' and , at the same time , was conscious of a feeling between hope and fear , that this might after all be a fool 's errand , and a wonder how they and the master of the house would meet if it turned out that they had taken fright without cause . At his exclamation , Amy leant forward and beckoned , Markham came up to the window , and after the greeting on each side , walked along with his hand on the door , as the carriage slowly mounted the steep hill , answering her questions , '
269707	269708	269705	269705	he	157	' '
269732	269733	269712	269712	He	157	' '
269741	269742	269735	269735	they	4824	' '

269884	269885	269877	269878	Mrs. Henley	232	' '
269893	269900	269877	269878	Mrs. Henley	232	' murmured Charles to his sister . '
269913	269917	269901	269901	We	4827	' proceeded Markman ; '
269931	269932	269934	269934	you	0	' '
269941	270121	269936	269936	I	0	' said Amy , smiling a little . Markham 's eye was on the little white bundle in her lap , but he did not speak of it , and went on with explanations about Mrs. Drew and Bolton , and the sitting - room , and tea being ready . Charles saw the great red pile of building rise dark , gloomy and haunted - looking before them . The house that should have been Amabel 's ! Guy 's own beloved home ! How could she bear it ? But she was eagerly asking Markham how Philip should be informed of their arrival , and Markham was looking perplexed , and saying , that to drive under the gateway , into the paved court , would make a thundering sound , that he dreaded for Mr. Morville . Could Mr. Charles Edmonstone cross the court on foot ? Charles was ready to do so ; the carriage stopped , Amabel gave the baby to Anne , saw Arnaud help Charles out ; and turning to Markham said , '
270139	270140	270146	270146	Arnaud	186	' '
270148	270221	270146	270146	Arnaud	186	' said Markham , and walked on fast with her , while Charles thought how strange to see her thus pass the threshold of her husband 's house , come thither to relieve and comfort his enemy . She entered the dark - oak hall . On one side the light shone cheerfully from the sitting - room , the other doors were all shut . Markham hesitated , and stood reluctant . '
270233	270346	270350	270350	she	4831	' said she , in the voice , so gentle , that no one perceived its resolution . Markham knocked at one of the high heavy doors , and softly opened it . Amabel stood behind it , and looked into the room , more than half dark , without a fire , and very large , gloomy , and cheerless , in the grey autumn twilight , that just enabled her to see the white pillows on the sofa , and Philip 's figure stretched out on it . Markham advanced , and stood doubtful for an instant , then in extremity , began—'Hem ! Lady Morville is come , and — '
270356	270363	270350	270350	she	4831	' How are you , Philip ? '
270375	270388	270371	270371	he	4828	' So you are come to heap more coals on my head . '
270408	270418	270405	270405	she	4831	' I am sorry to find you so poorly . '
270448	270455	270438	270438	he	4828	' Is it you , Amy ? '
270460	270469	270438	270438	he	4828	' Why ? When did you come here ? '
270470	270513	270438	270438	he	4828	' Just now . We were afraid you were ill , we heard a bad account of you , so we have taken you by storm : Charles , your goddaughter , and I , are come to pay you a visit . '
270514	270520	270522	270522	Philip	454	' Charles ! Charles here ? '
270527	270532	270522	270522	Philip	454	' Where is he ? '
270533	270537	270539	270539	Amy	425	' Coming in , '
270646	270652	270653	270653	he	454	' How did you come ? '
270656	270669	270653	270653	he	454	' It was very kind . I hope you will be comfortable . '
270670	270679	270681	270681	Amy	425	' We have taken good care of ourselves , '
270683	270717	270681	270681	Amy	425	' I wrote to Mr. Markham , for I thought you were not well enough to be worried with preparations . We ought to beg your pardon for breaking on you so unceremoniously . '
270718	270728	270730	270730	Philip	454	' If any one should be at home here — '
270744	270762	270736	270736	he	454	' I do n't know how to make you welcome enough . When did you set off ? '
270763	270767	270769	270769	Charles	156	' Yesterday afternoon , '
270771	270784	270769	270769	Charles	156	' we slept in London , and came on to - day . '
270785	270790	270792	270792	Philip	454	' Have you dined ? '
270805	270815	270792	270792	Philip	454	' Yes ; at K — , thank you . '
270816	270829	270769	270769	Charles	156	' What will you have ? I 'll ring for Mrs. Drew . '
270830	270859	270861	270861	Amabel	234	' No , thank you ; do n't tease yourself . Mrs. Drew will take care of us . Never mind ; but how bad your head is ! '
270888	270947	270861	270861	Amabel	234	' You must lie down and keep quiet , and never mind us . We only want a little tea . I am just going to take off my bonnet , and see what they have done with baby , and then I 'll come down . Pray lie still till then . Mind he does , Charlie . '
271141	271146	271137	271137	he	454	' gone for ever , '
271193	271196	271197	271197	he	454	' Charles , '
271200	271212	271197	271197	he	454	' I trust you have not let her run any risk ? '
271213	271223	271197	271197	he	454	' No : we got Dr. Mayerne 's permission . '
271224	271232	271234	271234	Philip	454	' It is like all the rest , '
271245	271255	271242	271242	he	454	' How did you know I was not well ? '
271256	271290	271197	271197	he	454	' Markham said something in a business letter that alarmed Amy . She wrote to inquire , and on his second letter we thought we had better come and see after you ourselves . '
271557	271563	271573	271573	she	234	' thinking herself into happiness , '
271784	271787	271789	271789	he	156	' Well , '
271796	271805	271789	271789	he	156	' all right with you and little miss ? '
271806	271817	271792	271792	she	425	' Quite , thank you . And are you rested ? '
271818	271838	271792	271792	she	425	' Slept like a top , and what did you do : Did you sleep like a sensible woman ? '
271839	271856	271789	271789	he	156	' Pretty well , and baby was very good . Have you heard anything of Philip ? '
271857	271871	271789	271789	he	156	' Bolton thinks him rather better , and says he is getting up . '
271872	271880	271792	271792	she	425	' How long have you been up ? '
271881	271933	271792	271792	she	425	' A long time . I told Arnaud to catch Markham when he came up , as he always does in the morning , to see after Philip , and I have had a conference with him and Bolton , so that I can lay the case before Dr. Mayerne scientifically . '
271934	271942	271789	271789	he	156	' What do you think of it ? '
271943	272080	271792	271792	she	425	' I think we came at the right time . He has been getting more and more into work in London , taking no exercise , and so was pretty well knocked up when he came here ; and this place finished it . He tried to attend to business about the property , but it always ended in his head growing so bad , he had to leave all to Markham , who , by the way , has been thoroughly propitiated by his anxiety for him . Then he gave up entirely ; has not been out of doors , written a note , nor seen a creature the last fortnight , but there he has lain by himself in the library , given up to all manner of dismal thoughts without a break . '
272081	272085	272087	272087	Amabel	234	' How dreadful ! '
272095	272114	272087	272087	Amabel	234	' Then he would not see Mr. Ashford ? Surely , he could have done something for him . '
272115	272122	272124	272124	Charles	156	' I 'll tell you what , '
272130	272148	272127	272127	his	156	' from what Bolton says , I think he had a dread of worse than brain fever . '
272161	272165	272167	272167	Charles	156	' I believe , '
272169	272267	272167	272167	Charles	156	' that it is one half nervous and the oppression of this place , and the other half , the over straining of a head that was already in a ticklish condition . I do n't think there was any real danger of more than such a fever as he had at Corfu , which would probably have been the death of him ; but I think he dreaded still worse , and that his horror of seeing any one , or writing to Laura , arose from not knowing how far he could control his words . '

272297	272375	272295	272295	Charles	156	' and probably has kept off the fever by strong measures , but of course , the more he reduced his strength , the greater advantage he gave to what was simply low spirits . He must have had a terrible time of it , and where it would have ended I can not guess ; but it seems to me that most likely , now that he is once roused , he will come right again . '
272521	272524	272525	272525	he	454	' Yes , '

272908	272934	272847	272848	Mrs. Ashford	332	' Then after all , you are disappointed in her , and do n't lament , like Markham , that she is not mistress here ? '
272935	273072	272847	272848	Mrs. Ashford	332	' No : I wo nt say I am disappointed ; she is a very sweet creature . O yes , very ! but far too soft and helpless for such a charge as this property , unless she had her father or brother to help her . But I must tell you that she took me to see her baby , a nice little lively thing , poor little dear ! and , when we were alone , she spoke rather more , begged me to send her godson to see her , thanked me for coming , but crying stopped her from saying more . I could grow very fond of her . No , I do n't wonder at him , for there is a great charm in anything so soft and dependent . '

276305	276339	276340	276341	Poor Thorndale	537	' They were very anxious for further intelligence , but received none , except that Philip had a letter from his friend , on which his only comment was a deep sigh , and '
276352	277011	276340	276341	Poor Thorndale	537	' Letters from Kilcoran became rare ; Laura scarcely wrote at all to Philip , and though Mrs. Edmonstone wrote as usual , she did not notice the subject ; while Charlotte 's gravity and constraint , when she did achieve a letter to Charles , were in such contrast to her usual free and would - be satirical style , that such eyes as her brother 's could hardly fail to see that something was on her mind . So it went on week after week , Charles and Amabel wondering when they should ever have any notice to go home , and what their family could be doing in Ireland . October had given place to November , and more than a week of November had passed , and here they still were , without anything like real tidings . At last came a letter from Mrs. Edmonstone which Amabel could not read without one little cry of surprise and dismay , and then had some difficulty in announcing its contents to Philip . Kilcoran , Nov. 6th . My dearest Amy , — You will be extremely surprised at what I have to tell you , and no less grieved . It has been a most unpleasant , disgraceful business from beginning to end , and the only comfort in it to us is the great discretion and firmness that Charlotte has shown . I had better , however , begin at the beginning , and tell you the history as far as I understand it myself . You know that Mr. James Thorndale has been here , and perhaps you know it was for the purpose of making an offer to Eveleen . Every one was much surprised at her refusing him , and still more when , after much prevarication , it came out that the true motive was her attachment to Mr. Fielder , the tutor . It appeared that they had been secretly engaged for some weeks , ever since they had perceived Mr. Thorndale 's intentions , and not , as it was in poor Laura 's case , an unavowed attachment , but an absolute engagement . And fancy Eva justifying it by Laura 's example ! There was of course great anger and confusion . Lord Kilcoran was furious , poor Lady Kilcoran had nervous attacks , the gentleman was dismissed from the house , and supposed to be gone to England , Eva shed abundance of tears , but after a great deal of vehemence she appeared subdued and submissive . We were all very sorry for her , as there is much that is very agreeable and likely to attract her in Mr. Fielder , and she always had too much mind to be wasted in such a life as she leads here . It seemed as if Laura was a comfort to her , and Lady Kilcoran was very anxious we should stay as long as possible . This was all about three weeks or a month ago ; Eva was recovering her spirits , and I was just beginning a letter to tell you we hoped to be at home in another week , when Charlotte came into my room in great distress to tell me that Eveleen and Mr. Fielder were on the verge of a run - away marriage . Charlotte had been coming back alone from a visit to grandmamma , and going down a path out of the direct way to recall Bustle , who had run off , she said , as if he scented mischief , came , to her great astonishment , on Eveleen walking arm - in - arm with Mr. Fielder ! Charlie will fancy how Charlotte looked at them ! They shuffled , and tried to explain it away , but Charlotte was too acute for them , or rather , she held steadily to '
277025	277087	277018	277019	Lord Kilcoran	182	' They tried to frighten her with the horrors of betraying secrets , but she said none had been confided to her , and mamma would judge . They tried to persuade her it was the way of all lovers , and appealed to Laura 's example , but there little Charlotte was less to be shaken than on any point . '
277099	277105	277088	277088	I	0	' she said to me , '
277132	277157	277166	277166	she	4953	' and as to Philip and Laura , they little knew what they had suffered ; besides , theirs was not half so bad . '
277488	277493	277485	277486	Dearest Amy	541	' Your most affectionate , '
277497	277559	277494	277495	L. Edmonstone	542	' The news was at length told , and Philip was indeed thunderstruck at this fresh consequence of his interference . It threatened at first to overthrow his scarcely recovered spirits , and but for the presence of his guests , it seemed as if it might have brought on a renewal of the state from which they had restored him . '
277562	277575	277494	277495	L. Edmonstone	542	' said Charles to Amy , when they talked it over alone . '

277669	277673	277631	277631	Laura	454	' said Amy ; '
277692	277787	277683	277683	mamma	5168	' Philip had not much peace till he had written to Mr. Thorndale , who was going at once to Germany , not liking to return home to meet the condolences . Mrs. Edmonstone had nearly the whole correspondence of the family on her hands ; for neither of her daughters liked to write , and she gave the description of the various uncomfortable scenes that took place , Lord De Courcy 's stern and enduring displeasure , and his father 's fast subsiding violence ; Lady Kilcoran 's distress , and the younger girls '

278094	278107	278049	278049	she	234	' You have been sitting opposite to it every day at dinner . '
278108	278111	278113	278113	Amy	541	' That ? '
278115	278161	278113	278113	Amy	541	' From what I heard , I fully expected to have known Sir Hugh 's in a moment ; and I often looked at that one , but I never could see more likeness than there is in almost all the pictures about the house . '
278175	278197	278162	278162	She	541	' I have seen him sometimes look like it ; but it is not at all the strong likeness I expected . '
278465	278478	278458	278458	he	454	' Do you dislike leaving that with me for a few minutes ? '
278479	278488	278490	278490	she	541	' Keep it as long as you like , '

279078	279101	279075	279075	she	5185	' Oh , Amy ! I am so glad to be come back to you . I have been so very miserable ! '

279115	279126	279075	279075	she	5185	' We think him looking better than in the summer . '
279127	279158	279075	279075	she	5185	' O yes ! Oh , Amy , what have you not done ? If you could guess the relief of hearing you were with him , after that suspense ! '

If I had only at first told mamma , he would not even have been blamed ; he would have been spared half this suffering and self - reproach ; he would have loved me more ; Eva might not have been led astray ; at least , she could not have laid it to my charge,—and I could lift up my head , '

279765	279778	279761	279761	Laura	527	' And at least you will be better able to comfort him . '

There sat Amabel on the floor , before the fire , her hand stretched out , playfully holding back the little one , who , with scanty , flossy , silken curls , hazel eyes , and jet black lashes , plump , mottled arms , and tiny tottering feet , stood crowing and shouting in exulting laughter , having just made a triumphant clutch at her mamma 's hair , and pulled down all the light , shining locks , while under their shade the reddening , smiling face recalled the Amy of days long gone by .

282817	282877	282878	282878	Mamma	5168	' They left her , and she stood a few minutes to enjoy the solitude , and to look from the window at her little girl , whom she had sent out with Anne .

282880	283083	282878	282878	Mamma	5168	' when Philip came out at the garden - door , and was crossing the lawn . Mary was very fond of him , flattered by the attention of the tallest person in the house , and she stretched out her arms , and gave a cry of summons . Amabel watched him turn instantly , take her from her nurse , and hold her in a close embrace , whilst her little round arms met round his neck . She was unwilling to be restored to Anne , and when he left her she looked up in his face , and unprompted , held up to him the primroses and violets in her hand . Those flowers were in his coat when Amabel saw him again at church , and she knew that this spontaneous proof of affection from Guy 's little unconscious child was more precious to him than all the kindnesses she could bestow . Little space was there for musing , for it was high time to set off for church . Mary Ross met the party at the wicket of the churchyard , took Charles on her arm , and by look and sign inquired for Amy . '

283154	283533	283145	283145	she	5104	' said Charles . Philip Morville and Laura Edmonstone stood before Mr. Ross . It was not such a wedding as the last . There was more personal beauty , but no such air of freshness , youth , and peace . He was , indeed , a very fine - looking man , his countenance more noble than it had ever been , though pale , and not only betraying the present suffering of the throbbing , burning brow , but with the appearance of a careworn , harassed man , looking more as if his age was five - and - thirty , than eight - and - twenty . And she , in her plain white muslin and quiet bonnet , was hardly bridal - looking in dress , and so it was with her face , still beautiful and brilliant in complexion , but with the weight of care permanent on it , and all the shades of feeling concealed by a fixed command of countenance , unable , however , to hide the oppression of dejection and anxiety . Yet to the eyes that only beheld the surface , there was nothing but prosperity and happiness in a marriage between a pair who had loved so long and devotedly , and after going through so much for each other 's sake , were united at length , with wealth , honour , and distinction before them . His health was re - established , and the last spring had proved that his talents would place him in such a position as had been the very object of his highest hopes . Was not everything here for which the fondest and most aspiring wishes could seek ? Yet for the very reason that there was sadness at almost every heart , not one tear was shed . Mrs. Edmonstone 's thoughts were less engrossed with the bride than with the young slender figure in black , standing in her own drooping way , her head bent down , and the fingers of her right hand clasping tight her own wedding - ring , through her white glove . The service was over . Laura hung round her mother 's neck in an ardent embrace . '

Mrs. Edmonstone 's kiss was a full answer , however , a kiss unlike what it had been with all her efforts for many and many a month . '
283622	283692	283693	283693	My	0	' were the last words breathed to her sister , as they were pressed in each other 's arms . Philip scarcely spoke , only met their kindnesses with grateful gestures and looks , and brief replies , and the parting was hastened that he might as soon as possible be able to be at rest . His only voluntary speech was as he bade farewell to Amabel , — '
