205	208	229	231	that young man	196	“ artists , ”
1151	1157	1158	1158	he	84	“ It may well be , ”
1167	1233	1158	1158	he	84	“ it may well be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet . You say you are a poet of law ; I say you are a contradiction in terms . I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden . ”
1310	1319	1320	1320	he	87	“ An artist is identical with an anarchist , ”
1323	1422	1320	1320	he	87	“ You might transpose the words anywhere . An anarchist is an artist . The man who throws a bomb is an artist , because he prefers a great moment to everything . He sees how much more valuable is one burst of blazing light , one peal of perfect thunder , than the mere common bodies of a few shapeless policemen . An artist disregards all governments , abolishes all conventions . The poet delights in disorder only . If it were not so , the most poetical thing in the world would be the Underground Railway . ”
1423	1428	1430	1431	Mr. Syme	85	“ So it is , ”
1433	1436	1438	1438	Gregory	87	“ Nonsense ! ”
1450	1563	1438	1438	Gregory	87	“ Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired , so very sad and tired ? I will tell you . It is because they know that the train is going right . It is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach . It is because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be Victoria , and nothing but Victoria . Oh , their wild rapture ! oh , their eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden , if the next station were unaccountably Baker Street ! ”
1564	1572	1574	1575	the poet	1944	“ It is you who are unpoetical , ”
1578	1749	1574	1575	the poet	1944	“ If what you say of clerks is true , they can only be as prosaic as your poetry . The rare , strange thing is to hit the mark ; the gross , obvious thing is to miss it . We feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird . Is it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station ? Chaos is dull ; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere , to Baker Street or to Bagdad . But man is a magician , and his whole magic is in this , that he does say Victoria , and lo ! it is Victoria . No , take your books of mere poetry and prose ; let me read a time table , with tears of pride . Take your Byron , who commemorates the defeats of man ; give me Bradshaw , who commemorates his victories . Give me Bradshaw , I say ! ”
1750	1755	1757	1757	Gregory	87	“ Must you go ? ”
1760	1765	1768	1768	Syme	85	“ I tell you , ”
1772	1892	1893	1893	Gregory	87	“ that every time a train comes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers , and that man has won a battle against chaos . You say contemptuously that when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria . I say that one might do a thousand things instead , and that whenever I really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape . And when I hear the guard shout out the word ‘ Victoria , ’ it is not an unmeaning word . It is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest . It is to me indeed ‘ Victoria ’ ; it is the victory of Adam . ”
1907	1912	1913	1913	he	87	“ And even then , ”
1916	1979	1913	1913	he	87	“ we poets always ask the question , ‘ And what is Victoria now that you have got there ? ’ You think Victoria is like the New Jerusalem . We know that the New Jerusalem will only be like Victoria . Yes , the poet will be discontented even in the streets of heaven . The poet is always in revolt . ”
1980	1984	1986	1986	Syme	85	“ There again , ”
1989	2060	1986	1986	Syme	85	“ what is there poetical about being in revolt ? You might as well say that it is poetical to be sea‑sick . Being sick is a revolt . Both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions ; but I ’m hanged if I can see why they are poetical . Revolt in the abstract is — revolting . It ’s mere vomiting . ”
2081	2088	2089	2089	he	85	“ It is things going right , ”
2092	2148	2089	2089	he	85	“ that is poetical ! Our digestions , for instance , going sacredly and silently right , that is the foundation of all poetry . Yes , the most poetical thing , more poetical than the flowers , more poetical than the stars — the most poetical thing in the world is not being sick . ”
2149	2152	2154	2154	Gregory	87	“ Really , ”
2157	2163	2154	2154	Gregory	87	“ the examples you choose — ”
2164	2170	2172	2172	Syme	85	“ I beg your pardon , ”
2175	2184	2172	2172	Syme	85	“ I forgot we had abolished all conventions . ”
2198	2205	2206	2206	he	85	“ You do n’t expect me , ”
2209	2217	2206	2206	he	85	“ to revolutionise society on this lawn ? ”
2228	2235	2236	2236	he	85	“ No , I do n’t , ”
2239	2260	2236	2236	he	85	“ but I suppose that if you were serious about your anarchism , that is exactly what you would do . ”
2287	2295	2296	2296	he	85	“ Do n’t you think , then , ”
2303	2312	2296	2296	he	85	“ that I am serious about my anarchism ? ”
2313	2319	2321	2321	Syme	85	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
2323	2332	2334	2334	Gregory	87	“ Am I not serious about my anarchism ? ”
2340	2345	2347	2347	Syme	85	“ My dear fellow ! ”
2371	2375	2376	2376	she	257	“ Mr. Syme , ”
2379	2404	2376	2376	she	257	“ do the people who talk like you and my brother often mean what they say ? Do you mean what you say now ? ”
2408	2412	2413	2413	he	85	“ Do you ? ”
2416	2422	2424	2425	the girl	255	“ What do you mean ? ”
2431	2437	2439	2439	Syme	85	“ My dear Miss Gregory , ”
2442	2545	2439	2439	Syme	85	“ there are many kinds of sincerity and insincerity . When you say ‘ thank you ’ for the salt , do you mean what you say ? No . When you say ‘ the world is round , ’ do you mean what you say ? No . It is true , but you do n’t mean it . Now , sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he does mean . It may be only a half‑truth , quarter‑truth , tenth‑truth ; but then he says more than he means — from sheer force of meaning it . ”
2597	2606	2607	2607	she	255	“ Is he really an anarchist , then ? ”
2610	2619	2621	2621	Syme	85	“ Only in that sense I speak of , ”
2623	2634	2635	2635	She	255	“ or if you prefer it , in that nonsense . ”
2645	2659	2637	2637	her	255	“ He would n’t really use — bombs or that sort of thing ? ”
2679	2685	2686	2686	he	259	“ Good Lord , no ! ”
2689	2697	2686	2686	he	259	“ that has to be done anonymously . ”
3203	3210	3212	3212	Gregory	106	“ I was waiting for you , ”
3214	3223	3212	3212	Gregory	106	“ Might I have a moment ’s conversation ? ”
3224	3230	3232	3232	Syme	85	“ Certainly . About what ? ”
3256	3262	3263	3263	he	274	“ About this and this , ”
3266	3310	3263	3263	he	274	“ about order and anarchy . There is your precious order , that lean , iron lamp , ugly and barren ; and there is anarchy , rich , living , reproducing itself — there is anarchy , splendid in green and gold . ”
3311	3316	3318	3318	Syme	85	“ All the same , ”
3321	3353	3318	3318	Syme	85	“ just at present you only see the tree by the light of the lamp . I wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the light of the tree . ”
3361	3383	3358	3358	he	274	“ But may I ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only to resume our little argument ? ”
3384	3387	3390	3390	Gregory	106	“ No , ”
3401	3419	3390	3390	Gregory	106	“ I did not stand here to resume our argument , but to end it for ever . ”
3452	3456	3457	3457	he	274	“ Mr. Syme , ”
3460	3489	3457	3457	he	274	“ this evening you succeeded in doing something rather remarkable . You did something to me that no man born of woman has ever succeeded in doing before . ”
3490	3493	3439	3439	Gregory	106	“ Indeed ! ”
3494	3499	3501	3501	Gregory	106	“ Now I remember , ”
3504	3533	3501	3501	Gregory	106	“ one other person succeeded in doing it . The captain of a penny steamer ( if I remember correctly ) at Southend . You have irritated me . ”
3534	3540	3542	3542	Syme	85	“ I am very sorry , ”
3546	3567	3569	3569	Gregory	106	“ I am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped out even with an apology , ”
3573	3639	3569	3569	Gregory	106	“ No duel could wipe it out . If I struck you dead I could not wipe it out . There is only one way by which that insult can be erased , and that way I choose . I am going , at the possible sacrifice of my life and honour , to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said . ”
3640	3646	3501	3501	Gregory	106	“ In what I said ? ”
3647	3659	3569	3569	Gregory	106	“ You said I was not serious about being an anarchist . ”
3660	3667	3669	3669	Syme	85	“ There are degrees of seriousness , ”
3671	3709	3669	3669	Syme	85	“ I have never doubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense , that you thought what you said well worth saying , that you thought a paradox might wake men up to a neglected truth . ”
3718	3725	3726	3726	he	85	“ And in no other sense , ”
3729	3764	3726	3726	he	85	“ you think me serious ? You think me a flâneur who lets fall occasional truths . You do not think that in a deeper , a more deadly sense , I am serious . ”
3777	3780	3781	3781	he	85	“ Serious ! ”
3784	3864	3781	3781	he	85	“ Good Lord ! is this street serious ? Are these damned Chinese lanterns serious ? Is the whole caboodle serious ? One comes here and talks a pack of bosh , and perhaps some sense as well , but I should think very little of a man who did n’t keep something in the background of his life that was more serious than all this talking — something more serious , whether it was religion or only drink . ”
3865	3869	3871	3871	Gregory	106	“ Very well , ”
3877	3890	3873	3873	his	85	“ you shall see something more serious than either drink or religion . ”
3907	3926	3781	3781	he	85	“ You spoke just now of having a religion . Is it really true that you have one ? ”
3927	3930	3932	3932	Syme	85	“ Oh , ”
3938	3945	3932	3932	Syme	85	“ we are all Catholics now . ”
3946	4034	3781	3781	he	85	“ Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your religion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going to tell you to any son of Adam , and especially not to the police ? Will you swear that ! If you will take upon yourself this awful abnegations if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow that you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream about , I will promise you in return — ”
4035	4043	4045	4045	Syme	85	“ You will promise me in return ? ”
4052	4062	4048	4049	the other	279	“ I will promise you a very entertaining evening . ”
4070	4074	4075	4075	he	85	“ Your offer , ”
4078	4166	4075	4075	he	85	“ is far too idiotic to be declined . You say that a poet is always an anarchist . I disagree ; but I hope at least that he is always a sportsman . Permit me , here and now , to swear as a Christian , and promise as a good comrade and a fellow‑artist , that I will not report anything of this , whatever it is , to the police . And now , in the name of Colney Hatch , what is it ? ”
4167	4171	4173	4173	Gregory	106	“ I think , ”
4179	4187	4188	4188	He	85	“ that we will call a cab . ”
4328	4336	4338	4338	Gregory	106	“ Will you take a little supper ? ”
4341	4359	4338	4338	Gregory	106	“ The pâté de foie gras is not good here , but I can recommend the game . ”
4388	4397	4380	4380	he	85	“ Oh , bring me some lobster mayonnaise . ”
4407	4412	4403	4404	the man	294	“ Certainly , sir ! ”
4421	4427	4429	4429	Gregory	106	“ What will you drink ? ”
4439	4475	4429	4429	Gregory	106	“ I shall only have a crême de menthe myself ; I have dined . But the champagne can really be trusted . Do let me start you with a half‑bottle of Pommery at least ? ”
4476	4480	4484	4484	Syme	85	“ Thank you ! ”
4486	4492	4484	4484	Syme	85	“ You are very good . ”
4542	4552	4553	4553	he	85	“ Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously ! ”
4560	4596	4553	4553	he	85	“ I do n’t often have the luck to have a dream like this . It is new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster . It is commonly the other way . ”
4597	4607	4609	4609	Gregory	106	“ You are not asleep , I assure you , ”
4611	4686	4553	4553	he	85	“ You are , on the contrary , close to the most actual and rousing moment of your existence . Ah , here comes your champagne ! I admit that there may be a slight disproportion , let us say , between the inner arrangements of this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentious exterior . But that is all our modesty . We are the most modest men that ever lived on earth . ”
4687	4693	4695	4695	Syme	85	“ And who are we ? ”
4702	4708	4710	4710	Gregory	106	“ It is quite simple , ”
4712	4726	4710	4710	Gregory	106	” We are the serious anarchists , in whom you do not believe . ”
4727	4730	4732	4732	Syme	85	“ Oh ! ”
4735	4743	4732	4732	Syme	85	“ You do yourselves well in drinks . ”
4744	4753	4755	4755	Gregory	106	“ Yes , we are serious about everything , ”
4764	4802	4761	4761	he	85	“ If in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little , do n’t put it down to your inroads into the champagne . I do n’t wish you to do yourself an injustice . ”
4803	4816	4818	4818	Syme	85	“ Well , if I am not drunk , I am mad , ”
4823	4841	4818	4818	Syme	85	“ but I trust I can behave like a gentleman in either condition . May I smoke ? ”
4842	4845	4847	4847	Gregory	106	“ Certainly ! ”
4853	4859	4860	4860	Syme	85	“ Try one of mine . ”
4949	4956	4958	4958	Gregory	106	“ You must not mind it , ”
4960	4968	4958	4958	Gregory	106	“ it ’s a kind of screw . ”
4969	4973	4975	4975	Syme	85	“ Quite so , ”
4978	4989	4975	4975	Syme	85	“ a kind of screw . How simple that is ! ”
5195	5200	5186	5186	he	85	“ Mr. Joseph Chamberlain . ”
5262	5274	5276	5276	Gregory	106	“ I must ask you to forgive me all these formalities , ”
5278	5287	5276	5276	Gregory	106	“ we have to be very strict here . ”
5288	5295	5297	5297	Syme	85	“ Oh , do n’t apologise , ”
5299	5309	5311	5311	he	85	“ I know your passion for law and order , ”
5469	5478	5480	5480	Gregory	106	“ And now , my dear Mr. Syme , ”
5496	5627	5480	5480	Gregory	106	“ now we are quite cosy , so let us talk properly . Now no human words can give you any notion of why I brought you here . It was one of those quite arbitrary emotions , like jumping off a cliff or falling in love . Suffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow , and , to do you justice , you are still . I would break twenty oaths of secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg . That way you have of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal of confession . Well , you said that you were quite certain I was not a serious anarchist . Does this place strike you as being serious ? ”
5628	5641	5643	5643	Syme	85	“ It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety , ”
5645	5726	5643	5643	Syme	85	“ but may I ask you two questions ? You need not fear to give me information , because , as you remember , you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the police , a promise I shall certainly keep . So it is in mere curiosity that I make my queries . First of all , what is it really all about ? What is it you object to ? You want to abolish Government ? ”
5727	5732	5734	5734	Gregory	106	“ To abolish God ! ”
5743	5837	5734	5734	Gregory	106	“ We do not only want to upset a few despotisms and police regulations ; that sort of anarchism does exist , but it is a mere branch of the Nonconformists . We dig deeper and we blow you higher . We wish to deny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue , honour and treachery , upon which mere rebels base themselves . The silly sentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of Man ! We hate Rights as we hate Wrongs . We have abolished Right and Wrong . ”
5838	5844	5846	5846	Syme	85	“ And Right and Left , ”
5852	5869	5846	5846	Syme	85	“ I hope you will abolish them too . They are much more troublesome to me . ”
5870	5878	5880	5880	Gregory	106	“ You spoke of a second question , ”
5882	5886	5888	5888	Syme	85	“ With pleasure , ”
5890	6016	6017	6017	Gregory	106	“ In all your present acts and surroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy . I have an aunt who lived over a shop , but this is the first time I have found people living from preference under a public‑house . You have a heavy iron door . You can not pass it without submitting to the humiliation of calling yourself Mr. Chamberlain . You surround yourself with steel instruments which make the place , if I may say so , more impressive than homelike . May I ask why , after taking all this trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth , you then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism to every silly woman in Saffron Park ? ”
6020	6026	6027	6027	he	311	“ The answer is simple , ”
6030	6067	6068	6068	Syme	85	“ I told you I was a serious anarchist , and you did not believe me . Nor do they believe me . Unless I took them into this infernal room they would not believe me . ”
6083	6093	6094	6094	he	311	“ The history of the thing might amuse you , ”
6097	6384	6094	6094	he	311	“ When first I became one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable disguises . I dressed up as a bishop . I read up all about bishops in our anarchist pamphlets , in Superstition the Vampire and Priests of Prey . I certainly understood from them that bishops are strange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind . I was misinformed . When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in a drawing‑room I cried out in a voice of thunder , ‘ Down ! down ! presumptuous human reason ! ’ they found out in some way that I was not a bishop at all . I was nabbed at once . Then I made up as a millionaire ; but I defended Capital with so much intelligence that a fool could see that I was quite poor . Then I tried being a major . Now I am a humanitarian myself , but I have , I hope , enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who , like Nietzsche , admire violence — the proud , mad war of Nature and all that , you know . I threw myself into the major . I drew my sword and waved it constantly . I called out ‘ Blood ! ’ abstractedly , like a man calling for wine . I often said , ‘ Let the weak perish ; it is the Law . ’ Well , well , it seems majors do n’t do this . I was nabbed again . At last I went in despair to the President of the Central Anarchist Council , who is the greatest man in Europe . ”
6385	6391	6393	6393	Syme	85	“ What is his name ? ”
6395	6402	6404	6404	Gregory	106	“ You would not know it , ”
6406	6475	6476	6476	He	312	“ That is his greatness . Caesar and Napoleon put all their genius into being heard of , and they were heard of . He puts all his genius into not being heard of , and he is not heard of . But you can not be for five minutes in the room with him without feeling that Caesar and Napoleon would have been children in his hands . ”
6490	6681	6682	6682	Syme	85	“ But whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling as an epigram , and yet as practical as the Bank of England . I said to him , ‘ What disguise will hide me from the world ? What can I find more respectable than bishops and majors ? ’ He looked at me with his large but indecipherable face . ‘ You want a safe disguise , do you ? You want a dress which will guarantee you harmless ; a dress in which no one would ever look for a bomb ? ’ I nodded . He suddenly lifted his lion ’s voice . ‘ Why , then , dress up as an anarchist , you fool ! ’ he roared so that the room shook . ‘ Nobody will ever expect you to do anything dangerous then . ’ And he turned his broad back on me without another word . I took his advice , and have never regretted it . I preached blood and murder to those women day and night , and — by God!—they would let me wheel their perambulators . ”
6696	6702	6703	6703	he	313	“ You took me in , ”
6706	6714	6703	6703	he	313	“ It is really a smart dodge . ”
6722	6733	6719	6719	he	313	“ What do you call this tremendous President of yours ? ”
6734	6741	6743	6743	Gregory	106	“ We generally call him Sunday , ”
6880	6898	6899	6899	I	0	” He got to his feet and strolled across the room with a sort of smiling embarrassment . “
6911	6916	6904	6904	you	314	” he continued casually . “
6999	7008	6982	6982	I	0	” He looked down for a moment modestly . “
7022	7023	7024	7026	My dear fellow	1981	” “
7028	7033	7024	7026	My dear fellow	1981	” said Syme heartily , “
7042	7057	7034	7034	I	0	” Gregory smiled in deprecation , and walked across the room , talking rapidly . “
7073	7077	7034	7034	I	0	” he said , “
7088	7148	7149	7149	I	0	” Syme also strolled across to the table , and found lying across it a walking‑stick , which turned out on examination to be a sword‑stick , a large Colt ’s revolver , a sandwich case , and a formidable flask of brandy . Over the chair , beside the table , was thrown a heavy‑looking cape or cloak . “
7160	7166	7149	7149	I	0	” continued Gregory with animation , “
7223	7255	7221	7221	Thursday	100	” And he clasped his hands . Syme , who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor , got to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation . “
7260	7265	7267	7267	I	0	” he asked vaguely , “
7285	7301	7278	7278	I	0	” He paused a moment , and then added with a sort of fresh curiosity , “
7311	7325	7308	7309	an ass	334	” There was a thoughtful silence again , and then he cried out — “
7395	7396	7378	7378	you	106	” “
7400	7406	7378	7378	you	106	” asked Gregory , wondering . “
7409	7415	7378	7378	you	106	” said Syme very seriously , “
7459	7460	7435	7435	you	106	” “
7464	7470	7435	7435	you	106	” asked the staring Gregory . “
7477	7478	7435	7435	you	106	” “
7481	7485	7435	7435	you	106	” said Syme , “
7491	7497	7499	7499	you	106	” Then after a pause , “
7502	7518	7499	7499	you	106	” Gregory glared at him gravely for a few moments , and then said abruptly — “
7564	7611	7554	7554	they	337	” Syme rose slowly to his feet and thrust his long , white hands into his long , grey trousers ’ pockets . Almost as he did so there came five knocks on the outer grating , proclaiming the arrival of the first of the conspirators . “
7614	7619	7554	7554	they	337	” said Syme slowly , “
7666	7679	7682	7682	you	0	” Gregory tried to spring up straight , but he swayed thrice . “
7685	7693	7682	7682	you	0	” he asked in an inhuman voice . “
7696	7701	7682	7682	you	0	” said Syme simply , “
7717	7726	7711	7711	I	0	” From the doorway there came a murmur of “
7731	7832	7727	7729	Mr. Joseph Chamberlain	94	” It was repeated twice and thrice , and then thirty times , and the crowd of Joseph Chamberlains ( a solemn thought ) could be heard trampling down the corridor . BEFORE one of the fresh faces could appear at the doorway , Gregory ’s stunned surprise had fallen from him . He was beside the table with a bound , and a noise in his throat like a wild beast . He caught up the Colt ’s revolver and took aim at Syme . Syme did not flinch , but he put up a pale and polite hand . “
7841	7853	7837	7839	a silly man	346	” he said , with the effeminate dignity of a curate . “
7882	7901	7879	7880	jolly sea‑sick	104	” Gregory could not speak , but he could not fire either , and he looked his question . “
7912	7916	7904	7904	you	339	” cried Syme . “
8068	8089	8061	8061	I	0	” Gregory put the pistol slowly down , still staring at Syme as if he were a sea - monster . “
8097	8103	8090	8090	I	0	” he said at last , “
8133	8134	8135	8135	I	0	” “
8142	8147	8150	8150	you	339	” said Syme sternly , “
8159	8214	8156	8157	your friends	345	” The mass of the anarchists entered the room heavily , with a slouching and somewhat weary gait ; but one little man , with a black beard and glasses — a man somewhat of the type of Mr. Tim Healy — detached himself , and bustled forward with some papers in his hand . “
8218	8222	8215	8216	Comrade Gregory	106	” he said , “
8231	8253	8228	8229	a delegate	361	” Gregory , taken by surprise , looked down and muttered the name of Syme ; but Syme replied almost pertly — “
8281	8303	8254	8254	I	0	” The brow of the little man with the black beard was , however , still contracted with something like suspicion . “
8310	8315	8307	8307	you	106	” he asked sharply . “
8324	8330	8316	8316	I	0	” said Syme , laughing ; “
8342	8343	8346	8346	you	106	” “
8349	8350	8346	8346	you	106	” “
8355	8360	8346	8346	you	106	” said Syme serenely , “
8386	8432	8369	8369	I	0	” The little man dropped one of his papers , and a flicker of fear went over all the faces of the group . Evidently the awful President , whose name was Sunday , did sometimes send down such irregular ambassadors to such branch meetings . “
8437	8448	8435	8435	comrade	366	” said the man with the papers after a pause , “
8462	8463	8451	8451	we	367	” “
8473	8480	8465	8465	you	366	” said Syme with severe benevolence , “
8487	8673	8674	8674	I	0	” When Gregory heard the dangerous dialogue end , with a sudden safety for his rival , he rose abruptly and paced the floor in painful thought . He was , indeed , in an agony of diplomacy . It was clear that Syme ’s inspired impudence was likely to bring him out of all merely accidental dilemmas . Little was to be hoped from them . He could not himself betray Syme , partly from honour , but partly also because , if he betrayed him and for some reason failed to destroy him , the Syme who escaped would be a Syme freed from all obligation of secrecy , a Syme who would simply walk to the nearest police station . After all , it was only one night ’s discussion , and only one detective who would know of it . He would let out as little as possible of their plans that night , and then let Syme go , and chance it . He strode across to the group of anarchists , which was already distributing itself along the benches . “
8682	8686	8674	8674	I	0	” he said ; “
8705	8727	8728	8728	Comrades	372	” This being approved by a show of hands , the little man with the papers slipped into the presidential seat . “
8730	8740	8728	8728	Comrades	372	” he began , as sharp as a pistol‑shot , “
9007	9051	9052	9052	I	0	” There was a stir of almost inaudible applause , such as is sometimes heard in church . Then a large old man , with a long and venerable white beard , perhaps the only real working‑man present , rose lumberingly and said — “
9061	9068	9070	9070	anyone	363	” and sat lumberingly down again . “
9073	9090	9070	9070	anyone	363	” asked the chairman . A little man with a velvet coat and pointed beard seconded . “
9100	9105	9106	9106	I	0	” said the chairman , “
9117	9298	9299	9299	Comrades	372	” Gregory rose amid a great rumble of applause . His face was deadly pale , so that by contrast his queer red hair looked almost scarlet . But he was smiling and altogether at ease . He had made up his mind , and he saw his best policy quite plain in front of him like a white road . His best chance was to make a softened and ambiguous speech , such as would leave on the detective ’s mind the impression that the anarchist brotherhood was a very mild affair after all . He believed in his own literary power , his capacity for suggesting fine shades and picking perfect words . He thought that with care he could succeed , in spite of all the people around him , in conveying an impression of the institution , subtly and delicately false . Syme had once thought that anarchists , under all their bravado , were only playing the fool . Could he not now , in the hour of peril , make Syme think so again ? “
9301	9312	9299	9299	Comrades	372	” began Gregory , in a low but penetrating voice , “
9634	9679	9620	9620	we	385	” ’ The applause that had greeted the opening sentences had been gradually growing fainter , and at the last word it stopped suddenly . In the abrupt silence , the man with the velvet jacket said , in a high , squeaky voice — “
9685	9686	9687	9688	Comrade Witherspoon	110	” “
9692	9696	9698	9698	he	110	” resumed Gregory , “
9819	9820	9815	9815	We	385	” “
9825	9835	9836	9836	I	0	” called out Mr. Witherspoon with the velvet jacket . “
9842	9847	9836	9836	I	0	” repeated Gregory furiously , “
9875	9876	9868	9868	We	385	” “
9879	9883	9868	9868	We	385	” cried Witherspoon . “
9887	9888	9889	9890	Comrade Witherspoon	110	” “
9892	9901	9889	9890	Comrade Witherspoon	110	” said Gregory , with a feverish gaiety , “
9933	9934	9889	9890	Comrade Witherspoon	110	” “
9939	9943	9889	9890	Comrade Witherspoon	110	” said Witherspoon , “
9948	9949	9889	9890	Comrade Witherspoon	110	” “
9956	9964	9889	9890	Comrade Witherspoon	110	” repeated Gregory , grinding his teeth , “
10031	10066	10068	10068	anyone	363	” Gregory resumed his seat and passed his hand across his forehead . The silence was sudden and awkward , but the chairman rose like an automaton , and said in a colourless voice — “
10076	10144	10068	10068	anyone	363	” The assembly seemed vague and sub‑consciously disappointed , and Comrade Witherspoon moved restlessly on his seat and muttered in his thick beard . By the sheer rush of routine , however , the motion would have been put and carried . But as the chairman was opening his mouth to put it , Syme sprang to his feet and said in a small and quiet voice — “
10153	10212	10213	10213	Comrades	372	” The most effective fact in oratory is an unexpected change in the voice . Mr. Gabriel Syme evidently understood oratory . Having said these first formal words in a moderated tone and with a brief simplicity , he made his next word ring and volley in the vault as if one of the guns had gone off . “
10215	10232	10147	10148	Mr. Chairman	112	” he cried , in a voice that made every man jump out of his boots , “
10404	10405	10406	10407	Comrade Gregory	106	” “
10506	10546	10547	10547	You	106	” Ever since Syme had risen Gregory had sat staring at him , his face idiotic with astonishment . Now in the pause his lips of clay parted , and he said , with an automatic and lifeless distinctness — “
10551	10571	10572	10573	Comrade Gregory	106	” Syme looked straight into those frightful eyes with his own pale blue ones , and said with dignity — “
10787	10885	10780	10780	I	0	” His sentence was drowned in a deafening cataract of applause . The faces , that had grown fiercer and fiercer with approval as his tirade grew more and more uncompromising , were now distorted with grins of anticipa­tion or cloven with delighted cries . At the moment when he announced himself as ready to stand for the post of Thursday , a roar of excitement and assent broke forth , and became uncontrollable , and at the same moment Gregory sprang to his feet , with foam upon his mouth , and shouted against the shouting . “
10892	10907	10910	10910	you	106	” he cried , at the top of a voice that tore his throat . “
10912	10942	10910	10910	you	106	” But louder than Gregory ’s shouting and louder than the roar of the room came the voice of Syme , still speaking in a peal of pitiless thunder — “
11047	11079	11080	11080	I	0	” The heavy clamour gradually died away , but before it had ceased Witherspoon had jumped to his feet , his hair and beard all on end , and had said — “
11096	11097	11088	11089	Comrade Syme	113	” “
11106	11116	11102	11102	I	0	” cried Gregory , with frantic face and hands . “
11124	11138	11102	11102	I	0	” The voice of the chairman clove his speech with a cold accent . “
11145	11202	11203	11203	I	0	” he said . A tall , tired man , with melancholy eyes and an American chin beard , was observed on the back bench to be slowly rising to his feet . Gregory had been screaming for some time past ; now there was a change in his accent , more shocking than any scream . “
11208	11220	11203	11203	I	0	” he said , in a voice as heavy as stone . “
11232	11233	11246	11246	he	360	” “
11236	11243	11246	11246	he	360	” said Syme , quite motionless , “
11248	11270	11246	11246	he	360	” Gregory ’s mouth worked twice without sound ; then slowly the blood began to crawl back into his dead face . “
11281	11320	11271	11271	He	360	” he said , and sat down abruptly . Before he had done so , the long , lean man with the American beard was again upon his feet , and was repeating in a high American monotone — “
11331	11332	11321	11321	I	0	” “
11344	11356	11321	11321	I	0	” said Mr. Buttons , the chairman , with mechanical rapidity . “
11364	11377	11378	11378	Comrades	372	” Gregory had again sprung to his feet , panting and passionate . “
11380	11385	11386	11386	I	0	” he cried out , “
11392	11393	11386	11386	I	0	” “
11398	11403	11386	11386	I	0	” said Mr. Witherspoon . “
11410	11426	11407	11408	a madman	455	” reiterated Gregory , with a frightful sincerity which for a moment staggered the room , “
11499	11542	11543	11544	Comrade Gregory	106	” Truth is so terrible , even in fetters , that for a moment Syme ’s slender and insane victory swayed like a reed . But you could not have guessed it from Syme ’s bleak blue eyes . He merely began — “
11547	11562	11543	11544	Comrade Gregory	106	” Then the spell was snapped , and one anarchist called out to Gregory — “
11571	11582	11584	11584	you	106	” ; and another anarchist added in a heavier voice , “
11589	11590	11591	11591	Comrades	372	” “
11593	11616	11591	11591	Comrades	372	” cried Gregory , in a voice like that of a martyr who in an ecstacy of pain has passed beyond pain , “
11670	11671	11672	11673	Comrade Gregory	106	” “
11675	11684	11672	11673	Comrade Gregory	106	” said the chairman after a painful pause , “
11692	11739	11672	11673	Comrade Gregory	106	” For the first time in the proceedings there was for a few seconds a real silence . Then Gregory fell back in his seat , a pale wreck of a man , and the chairman repeated , like a piece of clock‑work suddenly started again — “
11758	11898	11744	11745	Comrade Syme	113	” The roar rose like the sea , the hands rose like a forest , and three minutes afterwards Mr. Gabriel Syme , of the Secret Police Service , was elected to the post of Thursday on the General Council of the Anarchists of Europe . Everyone in the room seemed to feel the tug waiting on the river , the sword‑stick and the revolver , waiting on the table . The instant the election was ended and irrevocable , and Syme had received the paper proving his election , they all sprang to their feet , and the fiery groups moved and mixed in the room . Syme found himself , somehow or other , face to face with Gregory , who still regarded him with a stare of stunned hatred . They were silent for many minutes . “
11904	11910	11899	11899	You	462	” said Gregory at last . “
11917	11923	11912	11912	you	462	” said Syme with gravity . “
11931	11941	11926	11926	you	462	” began Gregory , shaking from head to foot , “
11946	11947	11926	11926	you	462	” “
11951	11956	11926	11926	you	462	” said Syme shortly . “
12027	12046	11977	11977	me	0	” and he pulled the great cloak about his shoulders and picked up the flask from the table . “
12053	12061	11977	11977	me	0	” said Mr. Buttons , bustling up . “
12070	12176	12177	12177	You	468	” With a gesture that revealed the shop - walker , he led Syme down a short , iron‑bound passage , the still agonised Gregory following feverishly at their heels . At the end of the passage was a door , which Buttons opened sharply , showing a sudden blue and silver picture of the moonlit river , that looked like a scene in a theatre . Close to the opening lay a dark , dwarfish steam - launch , like a baby dragon with one red eye . Almost in the act of stepping on board , Gabriel Syme turned to the gaping Gregory . “
12183	12194	12177	12177	You	468	” he said gently , with his face in shadow . “
12246	12247	12250	12250	you	468	” “
12253	12259	12250	12250	you	468	” cried the chaotic Gregory . “
12266	12267	12262	12262	I	0	” “
12273	13027	12262	12262	I	0	” said Syme , and he made a military salute with the sword‑stick as the steamboat slid away . GABRIEL SYME was not merely a detective who pretended to be a poet ; he was really a poet who had become a detective . Nor was his hatred of anarchy hypocritical . He was one of those who are driven early in life into too conservative an attitude by the bewildering folly of most revolutionists . He had not attained it by any tame tradition . His respectability was spontaneous and sudden , a rebellion against rebellion . He came of a family of cranks , in which all the oldest people had all the newest notions . One of his uncles always walked about without a hat , and another had made an unsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else . His father cultivated art and self‑realisation ; his mother went in for simplicity and hygiene . Hence the child , during his tenderer years , was wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of absinth and cocoa , of both of which he had a healthy dislike . The more his mother preached a more than Puritan abstinence the more did his father expand into a more than pagan latitude ; and by the time the former had come to enforcing vegetarianism , the latter had pretty well reached the point of defending cannibalism . Being surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from infancy , Gabriel had to revolt into something , so he revolted into the only thing left — sanity . But there was just enough in him of the blood of these fanatics to make even his protest for common sense a little too fierce to be sensible . His hatred of modern lawlessness had been crowned also by an accident . It happened that he was walking in a side street at the instant of a dynamite outrage . He had been blind and deaf for a moment , and then seen , the smoke clearing , the broken windows and the bleeding faces . After that he went about as usual — quiet , courteous , rather gentle ; but there was a spot on his mind that was not sane . He did not regard anarchists , as most of us do , as a handful of morbid men , combining ignorance with intellectualism . He regarded them as a huge and pitiless peril , like a Chinese invasion . He poured perpetually into newspapers and their waste‑paper baskets a torrent of tales , verses and violent articles , warning men of this deluge of barbaric denial . But he seemed to be getting no nearer his enemy , and , what was worse , no nearer a living . As he paced the Thames embankment , bitterly biting a cheap cigar and brooding on the advance of Anarchy , there was no anarchist with a bomb in his pocket so savage or so solitary as he . Indeed , he always felt that Government stood alone and desperate , with its back to the wall . He was too quixotic to have cared for it otherwise . He walked on the Embankment once under a dark red sunset . The red river reflected the red sky , and they both reflected his anger . The sky , indeed , was so swarthy , and the light on the river relatively so lurid , that the water almost seemed of fiercer flame than the sunset it mirrored . It looked like a stream of literal fire winding under the vast caverns of a subterranean country . Syme was shabby in those days . He wore an old - fashioned black chimney‑pot hat ; he was wrapped in a yet more old‑fashioned cloak , black and ragged ; and the combination gave him the look of the early villains in Dickens and Bulwer Lytton . Also his yellow beard and hair were more unkempt and leonine than when they appeared long afterwards , cut and pointed , on the lawns of Saffron Park . A long , lean , black cigar , bought in Soho for twopence , stood out from between his tightened teeth , and altogether he looked a very satisfactory specimen of the anarchists upon whom he had vowed a holy war . Perhaps this was why a policeman on the Embankment spoke to him , and said “
13031	13064	12262	12262	I	0	” Syme , at a crisis of his morbid fears for humanity , seemed stung by the mere stolidity of the automatic official , a mere bulk of blue in the twilight . “
13071	13076	12262	12262	I	0	” he said sharply . “
13164	13165	13149	13149	I	0	” “
13171	13176	13149	13149	I	0	” replied the policeman , “
13185	13186	13149	13149	I	0	” “
13189	13195	13149	13149	I	0	” said Syme , staring . “
13208	13213	13196	13197	The soldier	478	” pursued the policeman . “
13226	13227	13229	13229	God	95	” “
13235	13239	13229	13229	God	95	” said Syme . “
13245	13246	13229	13229	God	95	” “
13249	13255	13229	13229	God	95	” said the policeman sadly , “
13288	13289	13284	13284	I	0	” “
13296	13302	13292	13292	you	0	” asked Syme , wondering . “
13308	13341	13292	13292	you	0	” said the policeman The class sympathies which , false as they are , are the truest things in so many men , broke out of Syme before he could control them . “
13349	13353	13347	13347	man	1959	” he said , “
13362	13371	13372	13372	I	0	” The policeman sighed and shook his head . “
13375	13380	13372	13372	I	0	” he said solemnly , “
13388	13389	13381	13381	I	0	” “
13398	13405	13393	13393	you	0	” asked Syme with rude curiosity . “
13417	13422	13412	13412	you	0	” replied the other . “
13473	13474	13470	13470	myself	0	” “
13485	13489	13479	13479	you	0	” said Syme , “
13529	13544	13546	13547	the other	279	“ You have evidently not heard of the latest develop­ment in our police system , ”
13549	13598	13546	13547	the other	279	“ I am not surprised at it . We are keeping it rather dark from the educated class , because that class contains most of our enemies . But you seem to be exactly in the right frame of mind . I think you might almost join us . ”
13599	13605	13607	13607	Syme	85	“ Join you in what ? ”
13609	13615	13617	13618	the policeman	2202	“ I will tell you , ”
13621	13773	13617	13618	the policeman	2202	“ This is the situation : The head of one of our departments , one of the most celebrated detectives in Europe , has long been of opinion that a purely intellectual conspiracy would soon threaten the very existence of civilisation . He is certain that the scientific and artistic worlds are silently bound in a crusade against the Family and the State . He has , therefore , formed a special corps of policemen , policemen who are also philosophers . It is their business to watch the beginnings of this conspiracy , not merely in a criminal but in a controversial sense . I am a democrat myself , and I am fully aware of the value of the ordinary man in matters of ordinary valour or virtue . But it would obviously be undesirable to employ the common policeman in an investigation which is also a heresy hunt . ”
13784	13792	13793	13793	he	85	“ What do you do , then ? ”
13796	13804	13806	13809	the man in blue	491	“ The work of the philosophical policeman , ”
13811	13936	13806	13809	the man in blue	491	“ is at once bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary detective . The ordinary detective goes to pot‑houses to arrest thieves ; we go to artistic tea‑parties to detect pessimists . The ordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a diary that a crime has been committed . We discover from a book of sonnets that a crime will be committed . We have to trace the origin of those dreadful thoughts that drive men on at last to intellectual fanaticism and intellectual crime . We were only just in time to prevent the assassination at Hartle pool , and that was entirely due to the fact that our Mr. Wilks ( a smart young fellow ) thoroughly understood a triolet . ”
13937	13942	13944	13944	Syme	85	“ Do you mean , ”
13946	13964	13944	13944	Syme	85	“ that there is really as much connection between crime and the modern intellect as all that ? ”
13965	13972	13974	13975	the policeman	2202	“ You are not sufficiently democratic , ”
13977	14241	13974	13975	the policeman	2202	“ but you were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business . I tell you I am sometimes sick of my trade when I see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate . But this new movement of ours is a very different affair . We deny the snobbish English assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals . We remember the Roman Emperors . We remember the great poisoning princes of the Renaissance . We say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal . We say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher . Compared to him , burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men ; my heart goes out to them . They accept the essential ideal of man ; they merely seek it wrongly . Thieves respect property . They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it . But philosophers dislike property as property ; they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession . Bigamists respect marriage , or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy . But philosophers despise marriage as marriage . Murderers respect human life ; they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives . But philosophers hate life itself , their own as much as other people ’s . ”
14248	14254	14255	14255	he	85	“ How true that is , ”
14258	14446	14255	14255	he	85	“ I have felt it from my boyhood , but never could state the verbal antithesis . The common criminal is a bad man , but at least he is , as it were , a conditional good man . He says that if only a certain obstacle be removed — say a wealthy uncle — he is then prepared to accept the universe and to praise God . He is a reformer , but not an anarchist . He wishes to cleanse the edifice , but not to destroy it . But the evil philosopher is not trying to alter things , but to annihilate them . Yes , the modern world has retained all those parts of police work which are really oppressive and ignominious , the harrying of the poor , the spying upon the unfortunate . It has given up its more dignified work , the punishment of powerful traitors the in the State and powerful heresiarchs in the Church . The moderns say we must not punish heretics . My only doubt is whether we have a right to punish anybody else . ”
14447	14453	14455	14456	the policeman	2202	“ But this is absurd ! ”
14473	14550	14455	14456	the policeman	2202	“ but it is intolerable ! I do n’t know what you ’re doing , but you ’re wasting your life . You must , you shall , join our special army against anarchy . Their armies are on our frontiers . Their bolt is ready to fall . A moment more , and you may lose the glory of working with us , perhaps the glory of dying with the last heroes of the world . ”
14551	14563	14565	14565	Syme	85	“ It is a chance not to be missed , certainly , ”
14567	14635	14565	14565	Syme	85	“ but still I do not quite understand . I know as well as anybody that the modern world is full of lawless little men and mad little movements . But , beastly as they are , they generally have the one merit of disagreeing with each other . How can you talk of their leading one army or hurling one bolt . What is this anarchy ? ”
14636	14642	14644	14645	the constable	494	“ Do not confuse it , ”
14647	14841	14644	14645	the constable	494	“ with those chance dynamite outbreaks from Russia or from Ireland , which are really the outbreaks of oppressed , if mistaken , men . This is a vast philosophic movement , consisting of an outer and an inner ring . You might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring the priesthood . I prefer to call the outer ring the innocent section , the inner ring the supremely guilty section . The outer ring — the main mass of their supporters — are merely anarchists ; that is , men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness . They believe that all the evil results of human crime are the results of the system that has called it crime . They do not believe that the crime creates the punishment . They believe that the punishment has created the crime . They believe that if a man seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless as the flowers of spring . They believe that if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good . These I call the innocent section . ”
14842	14845	14847	14847	Syme	85	“ Oh ! ”
14849	14931	14847	14847	Syme	85	“ Naturally , therefore , these people talk about ‘ a happy time coming ’ ; ‘ the paradise of the future ’ ; ‘ mankind freed from the bondage of vice and the bondage of virtue , ’ and so on . And so also the men of the inner circle speak — the sacred priesthood . They also speak to applauding crowds of the happiness of the future , and of mankind freed at last . But in their mouths ”
14938	15072	14937	14937	his	2202	voice—“in their mouths these happy phrases have a horrible meaning . They are under no illusions ; they are too intellectual to think that man upon this earth can ever be quite free of original sin and the struggle . And they mean death . When they say that mankind shall be free at last , they mean that mankind shall commit suicide . When they talk of a paradise without right or wrong , they mean the grave . They have but two objects , to destroy first humanity and then themselves . That is why they throw bombs instead of firing pistols . The innocent rank and file are disappointed because the bomb has not killed the king ; but the high - priesthood are happy because it has killed somebody . ”
15073	15080	15082	15082	Syme	85	“ How can I join you ? ”
15090	15105	15107	15108	the policeman	2202	“ I know for a fact that there is a vacancy at the moment , ”
15110	15164	15107	15108	the policeman	2202	“ as I have the honour to be somewhat in the confidence of the chief of whom I have spoken . You should really come and see him . Or rather , I should not say see him , nobody ever sees him ; but you can talk to him if you like . ”
15165	15168	15170	15170	Syme	85	“ Telephone ? ”
15175	15178	15180	15181	the policeman	2202	“ No , ”

But the one thing that can never be told is the last notion of the President , for his notions grow like a tropical forest . So in case you do n’t know , I ’d better tell you that he is carrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing ourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now . Originally , of course , we met in a cell underground , just as your branch does . Then Sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant . He said that if you did n’t seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out . Well , he is the only man on earth , I know ; but sometimes I really think that his huge brain is going a little mad in its old age . For now we flaunt ourselves before the public . We have our breakfast on a balcony — on a balcony , if you please — overlooking Leicester Square . ”
17205	17213	17215	17215	Syme	85	“ And what do the people say ? ”
17217	17226	17228	17229	his guide	563	“ It ’s quite simple what they say , ”
17231	17247	17228	17229	his guide	563	“ They say we are a lot of jolly gentlemen who pretend they are anarchists . ”
17248	17258	17260	17260	Syme	85	“ It seems to me a very clever idea , ”
17262	17272	17275	17276	the other	279	“ Clever ! God blast your impudence ! Clever ! ”
17294	17312	17275	17276	the other	279	“ When you ’ve seen Sunday for a split second you ’ll leave off calling him clever . ”

18617	18748	18604	18605	the President	2320	“ our friend Tuesday does n’t seem to grasp the idea . He dresses up like a gentleman , but he seems to be too great a soul to behave like one . He insists on the ways of the stage conspirator . Now if a gentleman goes about London in a top hat and a frock‑coat , no one need know that he is an anarchist . But if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock‑coat , and then goes about on his hands and knees — well , he may attract attention . That ’s what Brother Gogol does . He goes about on his hands and knees with such inexhaustible diplomacy , that by this time he finds it quite difficult to walk upright . ”

When a householder finds a man under his bed , he will probably pause to note the circumstance . But if he finds a man under his bed in a top hat , you will agree with me , my dear Tuesday , that he is not likely even to forget it . Now when you were found under Admiral Biffin ’s bed — ”

21497	21546	21481	21482	the Marquis	745	“ whether it would n’t be better for me to do it with a knife . Most of the best things have been brought off with a knife . And it would be a new emotion to get a knife into a French President and wriggle it round . ”
21547	21552	21554	21555	the Secretary	701	“ You are wrong , ”
21563	21639	21640	21640	he	701	“ The knife was merely the expression of the old personal quarrel with a personal tyrant . Dynamite is not only our best tool , but our best symbol . It is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense of the prayers of the Christians . It expands ; it only destroys because it broadens ; even so , thought only destroys because it broadens . A man ’s brain is a bomb , ”
21657	21691	21640	21640	he	701	“ My brain feels like a bomb , night and day . It must expand ! It must expand ! A man ’s brain must expand , if it breaks up the universe . ”
21692	21704	21706	21707	the Marquis	745	“ I do n’t want the universe broken up just yet , ”
21709	21731	21706	21707	the Marquis	745	“ I want to do a lot of beastly things before I die . I thought of one yesterday in bed . ”
21732	21745	21747	21748	Dr. Bull	134	“ No , if the only end of the thing is nothing , ”
21756	21763	21747	21748	Dr. Bull	134	“ it hardly seems worth doing . ”

21788	21795	21785	21785	he	747	“ that nothing is worth doing . ”
21808	21866	21804	21805	the Secretary	701	“ We are wandering , however , from the point . The only question is how Wednesday is to strike the blow . I take it we should all agree with the original notion of a bomb . As to the actual arrangements , I should suggest that to­morrow morning he should go first of all to — ”

I have called you down here to tell you something so simple and shocking that even the waiters upstairs ( long inured to our levities ) might hear some new seriousness in my voice . Comrades , we were discussing plans and naming places . I propose , before saying anything else , that those plans and places should not be voted by this meeting , but should be left wholly in the control of some one reliable member . I suggest Comrade Saturday , Dr. Bull . ”
23035	23070	23030	23030	Sunday	107	“ Not one word more about the plans and places must be said at this meeting . Not one tiny detail more about what we mean to do must be mentioned in this company . ”

23772	23801	23770	23770	Sunday	107	“ I believe your own accent to be inimitable , though I shall practise it in my bath . Do you mind leaving your beard with your card ? ”

23837	23842	23843	23843	he	124	“ It was hot , ”
23846	23856	23858	23858	Sunday	107	“ I will do you the justice to say , ”
23868	23957	23858	23858	Sunday	107	“ that you seem to have kept pretty cool under it . Now listen to me . I like you . The consequence is that it would annoy me for just about two and a half minutes if I heard that you had died in torments . Well , if you ever tell the police or any human soul about us , I shall have that two and a half minutes of discomfort . On your discomfort I will not dwell . Good day . Mind the step . ”
24024	24029	24031	24032	the President	2320	“ Time is flying , ”
24057	24076	24077	24078	The Secretary	701	“ I must go off at once ; I have to take the chair at a Humanitarian meeting . ”
24086	24093	24094	24094	he	701	“ Would it not be better , ”
24100	24118	24094	24094	he	701	“ to discuss further the details of our project , now that the spy has left us ? ”
24119	24126	24128	24129	the President	2320	“ No , I think not , ”
24138	24160	24128	24129	the President	2320	“ Leave it as it is . Let Saturday settle it . I must be off . Breakfast here next Sunday . ”
24190	24203	24204	24204	he	2320	“ I must protest , President , that the thing is irregular , ”
24207	24243	24204	24204	he	2320	“ It is a fundamental rule of our society that all plans shall be debated in full council . Of course , I fully appreciate your forethought when in the actual presence of a traitor — ”
24244	24247	24249	24250	the President	2320	“ Secretary , ”
24253	24292	24249	24250	the President	2320	“ if you ’d take your head home and boil it for a turnip it might be useful . I ca n’t say . But it might . The Secretary reared back in a kind of equine anger . “
24299	24306	24293	24293	I	0	” he began in high offense . “
24315	24326	24293	24293	I	0	” said the President , nodding a great many times . “
24346	24352	24342	24342	you	827	” he roared , rising , “
24378	25337	24370	24370	you	827	” And with these words he shouldered his way out of the room , shaking with incomprehensible scorn . Four of the men left behind gaped after him without any apparent glimmering of his meaning . Syme alone had even a glimmering , and such as it was it froze him to the bone . If the last words of the President meant anything , they meant that he had not after all passed unsuspected . They meant that while Sunday could not denounce him like Gogol , he still could not trust him like the others . The other four got to their feet grumbling more or less , and betook themselves elsewhere to find lunch , for it was already well past midday . The Professor went last , very slowly and painfully . Syme sat long after the rest had gone , revolving his strange position . He had escaped a thunderbolt , but he was still under a cloud . At last he rose and made his way out of the hotel into Leicester Square . The bright , cold day had grown increasingly colder , and when he came out into the street he was surprised by a few flakes of snow . While he still carried the sword‑stick and the rest of Gregory ’s portable luggage , he had thrown the cloak down and left it somewhere , perhaps on the steam‑tug , perhaps on the balcony . Hoping , therefore , that the snow‑shower might be slight , he stepped back out of the street for a moment and stood up under the doorway of a small and greasy hair‑dresser ’s shop , the front window of which was empty , except for a sickly wax lady in evening dress . Snow , however , began to thicken and fall fast ; and Syme , having found one glance at the wax lady quite sufficient to depress his spirits , stared out instead into the white and empty street . He was considerably astonished to see , standing quite still outside the shop and staring into the window , a man . His top hat was loaded with snow like the hat of Father Christmas , the white drift was rising round his boots and ankles ; but it seemed as if nothing could tear him away from the contemplation of the colourless wax doll in dirty evening dress . That any human being should stand in such weather looking into such a shop was a matter of sufficient wonder to Syme ; but his idle wonder turned suddenly into a personal shock ; for he realised that the man standing there was the paralytic old Professor de Worms . It scarcely seemed the place for a person of his years and infirmities . Syme was ready to believe anything about the perversions of this dehumanized brotherhood ; but even he could not believe that the Professor had fallen in love with that particular wax lady . He could only suppose that the man ’s malady ( whatever it was ) involved some momentary fits of rigidity or trance . He was not inclined , however , to feel in this case any very compassionate concern . On the contrary , he rather congratulated himself that the Professor ’s stroke and his elaborate and limping walk would make it easy to escape from him and leave him miles behind . For Syme thirsted first and last to get clear of the whole poisonous atmosphere , if only for an hour . Then he could collect his thoughts , formulate his policy , and decide finally whether he should or should not keep faith with Gregory . He strolled away through the dancing snow , turned up two or three streets , down through two or three others , and entered a small Soho restaurant for lunch . He partook reflectively of four small and quaint courses , drank half a bottle of red wine , and ended up over black coffee and a black cigar , still thinking . He had taken his seat in the upper room of the restaurant , which was full of the chink of knives and the chatter of foreigners . He remembered that in old days he had imagined that all these harmless and kindly aliens were anarchists . He shuddered , remembering the real thing . But even the shudder had the delightful shame of escape . The wine , the common food , the familiar place , the faces of natural and talkative men , made him almost feel as if the Council of the Seven Days had been a bad dream ; and although he knew it was nevertheless an objective reality , it was at least a distant one . Tall houses and populous streets lay between him and his last sight of the shameful seven ; he was free in free London , and drinking wine among the free . With a somewhat easier action , he took his hat and stick and strolled down the stair into the shop below . When he entered that lower room he stood stricken and rooted to the spot . At a small table , close up to the blank window and the white street of snow , sat the old anarchist Professor over a glass of milk , with his lifted livid face and pendent eyelids . For an instant Syme stood as rigid as the stick he leant upon . Then with a gesture as of blind hurry , he brushed past the Professor , dashing open the door and slamming it behind him , and stood outside in the snow . “
25346	25356	25339	25341	that old corpse	829	” he asked himself , biting his yellow moustache . “
25426	26723	25412	25412	Sunday	107	” He set off at a smart pace , twisting and whirling his stick , in the direction of Covent Garden . As he crossed the great market the snow increased , growing blinding and bewildering as the afternoon began to darken . The snow‑flakes tormented him like a swarm of silver bees . Getting into his eyes and beard , they added their unremitting futility to his already irritated nerves ; and by the time that he had come at a swinging pace to the beginning of Fleet Street , he lost patience , and finding a Sunday teashop , turned into it to take shelter . He ordered another cup of black coffee as an excuse . Scarcely had he done so , when Professor de Worms hobbled heavily into the shop , sat down with difficulty and ordered a glass of milk . Syme ’s walking‑stick had fallen from his hand with a great clang , which confessed the concealed steel . But the Professor did not look round . Syme , who was commonly a cool character , was literally gaping as a rustic gapes at a conjuring trick . He had seen no cab following ; he had heard no wheels outside the shop ; to all mortal appearances the man had come on foot . But the old man could only walk like a snail , and Syme had walked like the wind . He started up and snatched his stick , half crazy with the contradiction in mere arithmetic , and swung out of the swinging doors , leaving his coffee untasted . An omnibus going to the Bank went rattling by with an unusual rapidity . He had a violent run of a hundred yards to reach it ; but he managed to spring , swaying upon the splash‑board and , pausing for an instant to pant , he climbed on to the top . When he had been seated for about half a minute , he heard behind him a sort of heavy and asthmatic breathing . Turning sharply , he saw rising gradually higher and higher up the omnibus steps a top hat soiled and dripping with snow , and under the shadow of its brim the short‑sighted face and shaky shoulders of Professor de Worms . He let himself into a seat with characteristic care , and wrapped himself up to the chin in the mackintosh rug . Every movement of the old man ’s tottering figure and vague hands , every uncertain gesture and panic‑stricken pause , seemed to put it beyond question that he was helpless , that he was in the last imbecility of the body . He moved by inches , he let himself down with little gasps of caution . And yet , unless the philosophical entities called time and space have no vestige even of a practical existence , it appeared quite unquestionable that he had run after the omnibus . Syme sprang erect upon the rocking car , and after staring wildly at the wintry sky , that grew gloomier every moment , he ran down the steps . He had repressed an elemental impulse to leap over the side . Too bewildered to look back or to reason , he rushed into one of the little courts at the side of Fleet Street as a rabbit rushes into a hole . He had a vague idea , if this incomprehensible old Jack‑in‑the‑box was really pursuing him , that in that labyrinth of little streets he could soon throw him off the scent . He dived in and out of those crooked lanes , which were more like cracks than thoroughfares ; and by the time that he had completed about twenty alternate angles and described an unthinkable polygon , he paused to listen for any sound of pursuit . There was none ; there could not in any case have been much , for the little streets were thick with the soundless snow . Somewhere behind Red Lion Court , however , he noticed a place where some energetic citizen had cleared away the snow for a space of about twenty yards , leaving the wet , glistening cobble‑stones . He thought little of this as he passed it , only plunging into yet another arm of the maze . But when a few hundred yards farther on he stood still again to listen , his heart stood still also , for he heard from that space of rugged stones the clinking crutch and labouring feet of the infernal cripple . The sky above was loaded with the clouds of snow , leaving London in a darkness and oppression premature for that hour of the evening . On each side of Syme the walls of the alley were blind and featureless ; there was no little window or any kind of eve . He felt a new impulse to break out of this hive of houses , and to get once more into the open and lamp - lit street . Yet he rambled and dodged for a long time before he struck the main thoroughfare . When he did so , he struck it much farther up than he had fancied . He came out into what seemed the vast and void of Ludgate Circus , and saw St. Paul ’s Cathedral sitting in the sky . At first he was startled to find these great roads so empty , as if a pestilence had swept through the city . Then he told himself that some degree of emptiness was natural ; first because the snow‑storm was even dangerously deep , and secondly because it was Sunday . And at the very word Sunday he bit his lip ; the word was henceforth for hire like some indecent pun . Under the white fog of snow high up in the heaven the whole atmosphere of the city was turned to a very queer kind of green twilight , as of men under the sea . The sealed and sullen sunset behind the dark dome of St. Paul ’s had in it smoky and sinister colours — colours of sickly green , dead red or decaying bronze , that were just bright enough to emphasise the solid whiteness of the snow . But right up against these dreary colours rose the black bulk of the cathedral ; and upon the top of the cathedral was a random splash and great stain of snow , still clinging as to an Alpine peak . It had fallen accidentally , but just so fallen as to half drape the dome from its very topmost point , and to pick out in perfect silver the great orb and the cross . When Syme saw it he suddenly straightened himself , and made with his sword‑stick an involuntary salute . He knew that that evil figure , his shadow , was creeping quickly or slowly behind him , and he did not care . It seemed a symbol of human faith and valour that while the skies were darkening that high place of the earth was bright . The devils might have captured heaven , but they had not yet captured the cross . He had a new impulse to tear out the secret of this dancing , jumping and pursuing paralytic ; and at the entrance of the court as it opened upon the Circus he turned , stick in hand , to face his pursuer . Professor de Worms came slowly round the corner of the irregular alley behind him , his unnatural form outlined against a lonely gas‑lamp , irresistibly recalling that very imaginative figure in the nursery rhymes , “
26733	26899	25412	25412	Sunday	107	” He really looked as if he had been twisted out of shape by the tortuous streets he had been threading . He came nearer and nearer , the lamplight shining on his lifted spectacles , his lifted , patient face . Syme waited for him as St. George waited for the dragon , as a man waits for a final explanation or for death . And the old Professor came right up to him and passed him like a total stranger , without even a blink of his mournful eyelids . There was something in this silent and unexpected innocence that left Syme in a final fury . The man ’s colourless face and manner seemed to assert that the whole following had been an accident . Syme was galvanised with an energy that was something between bitterness and a burst of boyish derision . He made a wild gesture as if to knock the old man ’s hat off , called out something like “
26906	27345	25412	25412	Sunday	107	” and went racing away across the white , open Circus . Concealment was impossible now ; and looking back over his shoulder , he could see the black figure of the old gentleman coming after him with long , swinging strides like a man winning a mile race . But the head upon that bounding body was still pale , grave and professional , like the head of a lecturer upon the body of a harlequin . This outrageous chase sped across Ludgate Circus , up Ludgate Hill , round St. Paul ’s Cathedral , along Cheapside , Syme remembering all the nightmares he had ever known . Then Syme broke away towards the river , and ended almost down by the docks . He saw the yellow panes of a low , lighted public‑house , flung himself into it and ordered beer . It was a foul tavern , sprinkled with foreign sailors , a place where opium might be smoked or knives drawn . A moment later Professor de Worms entered the place , sat down carefully , and asked for a glass of milk . WHEN Gabriel Syme found himself finally established in a chair , and opposite to him , fixed and final also , the lifted eyebrows and leaden eyelids of the Professor , his fears fully returned . This incomprehensible man from the fierce council , after all , had certainly pursued him . If the man had one character as a paralytic and another character as a pursuer , the antithesis might make him more interesting , but scarcely more soothing . It would be a very small comfort that he could not find the Professor out , if by some serious accident the Professor should find him out . He emptied a whole pewter pot of ale before the professor had touched his milk . One possibility , however , kept him hopeful and yet helpless . It was just possible that this escapade signified something other than even a slight suspicion of him . Perhaps it was some regular form or sign . Perhaps the foolish scamper was some sort of friendly signal that he ought to have understood . Perhaps it was a ritual . Perhaps the new Thursday was always chased along Cheapside , as the new Lord Mayor is always escorted along it . He was just selecting a tentative inquiry , when the old Professor opposite suddenly and simply cut him short . Before Syme could ask the first diplomatic question , the old anarchist had asked suddenly , without any sort of preparation — “
27351	27389	27390	27391	A policeman	353	” Whatever else Syme had expected , he had never expected anything so brutal and actual as this . Even his great presence of mind could only manage a reply with an air of rather blundering jocularity . “
27393	27400	27390	27391	A policeman	353	” he said , laughing vaguely . “
27413	27414	27403	27403	you	836	” “
27421	27427	27403	27403	you	836	” answered the Professor patiently . “
27441	27442	27436	27436	I	0	” “
27457	27464	27444	27444	I	0	” asked Syme , smiling wildly . “
27503	27527	27500	27501	a postman	844	” The old Professor shook his head with a gravity that gave no hope , but Syme ran on with a feverish irony . “
27619	27620	27609	27609	I	0	” “
27628	27643	27609	27609	I	0	” said the old man , ignoring all Syme ’s improvised and desperate raillery . “
27649	27663	27645	27645	you	0	” Syme ’s heart turned to stone , but his face never changed . “
27669	27673	27664	27664	Your	2017	” he began . “
27678	27696	27698	27698	you	0	” The old man struck his palsied hand passionately on the rickety table , nearly breaking it . “
27710	27720	27698	27698	you	0	” he shrieked in a high , crazy voice . “
27733	27734	27698	27698	you	0	” “
27737	27751	27698	27698	you	0	” answered Syme , like a man standing on the hangman ’s drop . “
27756	27777	27778	27778	You	0	” said the old man , leaning across to him , his dead face becoming as it were loathsomely alive . “
27856	27881	27848	27848	You	0	” He leant his angular elbow far across the table , and put up his large loose hand like a flap to his ear . “
27890	27913	27882	27882	I	0	” said Syme with insane calm . Professor de Worms fell back in his chair with a curious air of kindly collapse . “
27919	27923	27882	27882	I	0	” he said , “
27928	27944	27925	27925	I	0	” Syme sprang up straight , sending back the bench behind him with a crash . “
27950	27955	27956	27956	You	0	” he said thickly . “
27960	27961	27956	27956	You	0	” “
27967	27983	27964	27965	a policeman	353	” said the Professor with his first broad smile . and beaming through his spectacles . “
28048	28398	28042	28042	I	0	” And with these words he laid on the table before Syme an exact facsimile of the blue card which Syme had in his own waistcoat pocket , the symbol of his power from the police . Syme had for a flash the sensation that the cosmos had turned exactly upside down , that all trees were growing downwards and that all stars were under his feet . Then came slowly the opposite conviction . For the last twenty‑four hours the cosmos had really been upside down , but now the capsized universe had come right side up again . This devil from whom he had been fleeing all day was only an elder brother of his own house , who on the other side of the table lay back and laughed at him . He did not for the moment ask any questions of detail ; he only knew the happy and silly fact that this shadow , which had pursued him with an intolerable oppression of peril , was only the shadow of a friend trying to catch him up . He knew simultane­ously that he was a fool and a free man . For with any recovery from morbidity there must go a certain healthy humiliation . There comes a certain point in such conditions when only three things are possible : first a perpetuation of Satanic pride , secondly tears , and third laughter . Syme ’s egotism held hard to the first course for a few seconds , and then suddenly adopted the third . Taking his own blue police ticket from his own waist coat pocket , he tossed it on to the table ; then he flung his head back until his spike of yellow beard almost pointed at the ceiling , and shouted with a barbaric laughter . Even in that close den , perpetually filled with the din of knives , plates , cans , clamorous voices , sudden struggles and stampedes , there was something Homeric in Syme ’s mirth which made many half - drunken men look round . “
28406	28415	28417	28417	myself	0	” asked one wondering labourer from the docks . “
28419	28435	28417	28417	myself	0	” answered Syme , and went off again into the agony of his ecstatic reaction . “
28440	28445	28437	28437	yourself	870	” said the Professor , “
28462	28463	28457	28457	I	0	” “
28471	28475	28464	28464	You	870	” said Syme . “
28479	28492	28464	28464	You	870	” said the other , in tones of withering and unfathomable contempt , “
28528	28539	28497	28497	you	870	” he added , glancing around at the reeling crowd , “
28560	28592	28593	28593	I	0	” and he knocked the tumbler off the table , making a crash of glass and a splash of silver fluid . Syme was staring at him with a happy curiosity . “
28597	28601	28593	28593	I	0	” he cried ; “
28614	28615	28616	28616	I	0	” “
28625	28631	28616	28616	I	0	” replied Professor de Worms . “
28662	28663	28656	28656	I	0	” “
28670	28675	28667	28667	I	0	” said Syme impatiently , “
28684	28685	28667	28667	I	0	” “
28688	28694	28667	28667	I	0	” answered the other dispassionately . “
28701	28766	28768	28768	you	870	” Syme ’s laughter at all this had about it a wild weakness of relief . He laughed at the idea of the paralytic Professor being really a young actor dressed up as if for the foot‑lights . But he felt that he would have laughed as loudly if a pepper­pot had fallen over . The false Professor drank and wiped his false beard . “
28771	28775	28768	28768	you	870	” he asked , “
28785	28786	28787	28787	I	0	” “
28797	28804	28791	28791	I	0	” answered Syme in some surprise . “
28810	28811	28808	28808	you	870	” “
28820	28830	28812	28812	I	0	” replied the man who called himself de Worms . “
28847	28848	28833	28834	the President	2320	” “
28858	28868	28852	28852	he	2320	” said Syme , with his rather reckless laughter . “
28880	28881	28869	28869	I	0	” “
28886	28892	28884	28884	I	0	” said the Professor grimly ; “
28898	28907	28895	28895	Gogol	124	” Syme struck the table with an exclamation . “
28917	28921	28912	28914	three of us	882	” he cried . “
28941	28957	28958	28958	We	883	” The face of Professor de Worms darkened , and he did not look up . “
28962	28966	28958	28958	We	883	” he said . “
28980	28981	28958	28958	We	883	” “
28991	28999	28958	28958	We	883	” asked Syme , jeering rather boisterously . “
29002	29009	29017	29017	Sunday	107	” said the Professor with sobriety , “
29019	29144	29145	29145	Professor	884	” And the mere name struck Syme cold and serious ; his laughter had died in his heart before it could die on his lips . The face of the unforgettable President sprang into his mind as startling as a coloured photograph , and he remarked this difference between Sunday and all his satellites , that their faces , however fierce or sinister , became gradually blurred by memory like other human faces , whereas Sunday ’s seemed almost to grow more actual during absence , as if a man ’s painted portrait should slowly come alive . They were both silent for a measure of moments , and then Syme ’s speech came with a rush , like the sudden foaming of champagne . “
29147	29151	29145	29145	Professor	884	” he cried , “
29163	29188	29157	29157	you	884	” The Professor lifted his heavy lids , and gazed at Syme with large , wide‑open , blue eyes of an almost ethereal honesty . “
29194	29199	29191	29191	I	0	” he said mildly . “
29204	29233	29202	29202	you	884	” Syme was dumb for an instant . Then he rose to his feet erect , like an insulted man , and thrust the chair away from him . “
29236	29244	29245	29245	you	884	” he said in a voice indescribable , “
29302	29303	29296	29296	I	0	” “
29306	29312	29296	29296	I	0	” asked the staring Professor . “
29315	29316	29296	29296	I	0	” “
29324	29328	29318	29318	I	0	” said Syme ; “
29344	29381	29296	29296	I	0	” De Worms blinked at him with a sort of blind wonder . He made an effort to speak , but Syme went on in a low voice , but with an undercurrent of inhuman exaltation — “
29504	29520	29489	29489	I	0	” The other looked at the ceiling , one of the tricks of his pose . “
29527	29531	29521	29521	Sunday	107	” he said . “
29540	29563	29521	29521	Sunday	107	” said Syme , and put on his hat . The decision of his gesture drew the Professor vaguely to his feet . “
29569	29580	29521	29521	Sunday	107	” he asked , with a sort of benevolent bewilderment , “
29587	29588	29521	29521	Sunday	107	” “
29591	29596	29521	29521	Sunday	107	” replied Syme shortly , “
29609	29610	29597	29597	I	0	” “
29617	29622	29597	29597	I	0	” inquired the other . “
29625	29632	29597	29597	I	0	” said Syme with equal decision . “
29639	29656	29597	29597	I	0	” resumed the soi‑disant de Worms , pulling his beard and looking out of the window , “
29729	29733	29735	29735	Syme	85	“ Confound it ! ”
29737	29747	29735	29735	Syme	85	“ And we do n’t know where he is . ”
29748	29751	29753	29754	the other	279	“ Yes , ”
29762	29770	29753	29754	the other	279	“ I know where he is myself . ”
29771	29777	29779	29779	Syme	85	“ Will you tell me ? ”
29784	29791	29793	29794	the Professor	805	“ I will take you there , ”
29818	29824	29825	29825	he	85	“ What do you mean ? ”
29829	29841	29825	29825	he	85	“ Will you join me ? Will you take the risk ? ”
29842	29846	29848	29849	the Professor	805	“ Young man , ”
29852	29917	29848	29849	the Professor	805	“ I am amused to observe that you think I am a coward . As to that I will say only one word , and that shall be entirely in the manner of your own philosophical rhetoric . You think that it is possible to pull down the President . I know that it is impossible , and I am going to try it , ”
30055	30061	30062	30062	Syme	85	“ Where are you going ? ”
30065	30069	30071	30072	the Professor	805	“ Just now , ”
30074	30100	30071	30072	the Professor	805	“ I am going just round the corner to see whether Dr. Bull has gone to bed . He is hygienic , and retires early . ”
30101	30105	30107	30107	Syme	85	“ Dr. Bull ! ”
30109	30117	30107	30107	Syme	85	“ Does he live round the corner ? ”
30118	30121	30123	30124	his friend	507	“ No , ”
30126	30159	30177	30177	he	805	“ As a matter of fact he lives some way off , on the other side of the river , but we can tell from here whether he has gone to bed . ”
30328	30334	30335	30335	he	132	“ We are too late , ”
30338	30347	30335	30335	he	132	“ the hygienic Doctor has gone to bed . ”
30348	30354	30356	30356	Syme	85	“ What do you mean ? ”
30358	30367	30335	30335	he	132	“ Does he live over there , then ? ”
30368	30371	30373	30374	de Worms	132	“ Yes , ”
30376	30402	30373	30374	de Worms	132	“ behind that particular window which you ca n’t see . Come along and get some dinner . We must call on him to‑morrow morning . ”

30528	30541	30524	30524	Syme	85	“ that this is the corresponding decent place in the East End ? ”
30542	30546	30548	30549	the Professor	805	“ It is , ”
30757	30766	30768	30768	Syme	85	“ That ’s a good get‑up of yours , ”
30776	30798	30768	30768	Syme	85	“ a lot better than old Gogol ’s . Even at the start I thought he was a bit too hairy . ”

30812	30865	30808	30809	the Professor	805	“ Gogol was an idealist . He made up as the abstract or platonic ideal of an anarchist . But I am a realist . I am a portrait painter . But , indeed , to say that I am a portrait painter is an inadequate expression . I am a portrait . ”

30888	30909	30885	30886	the Professor	805	“ I am a portrait of the celebrated Professor de Worms , who is , I believe , in Naples . ”
30910	30920	30922	30922	Syme	85	“ You mean you are made up like him , ”
30924	30939	30922	30922	Syme	85	“ But does n’t he know that you are taking his nose in vain ? ”
30940	30947	30949	30950	his friend	507	“ He knows it right enough , ”
30953	30962	30949	30950	his friend	507	“ Then why does n’t he denounce you ? ”
30963	30969	30971	30972	the Professor	805	“ I have denounced him , ”
30974	30979	30981	30981	Syme	85	“ Do explain yourself , ”
30983	30996	30998	31001	the eminent foreign philosopher	948	“ With pleasure , if you do n’t mind hearing my story , ”
31003	31462	30998	31001	the eminent foreign philosopher	948	“ I am by profession an actor , and my name is Wilks . When I was on the stage I mixed with all sorts of Bohemian and blackguard company . Sometimes I touched the edge of the turf , sometimes the riff‑raff of the arts , and occasionally the political refugee . In some den of exiled dreamers I was introduced to the great German Nihilist philosopher , Professor de Worms . I did not gather much about him beyond his appearance , which was very disgusting , and which I studied carefully . I understood that he had proved that the destructive principle in the universe was God ; hence he insisted on the need for a furious and incessant energy , rending all things in pieces . Energy , he said , was the All . He was lame , shortsighted , and partially paralytic . When I met him I was in a frivolous mood , and I disliked him so much that I resolved to imitate him . If I had been a draughtsman I would have drawn a caricature . I was only an actor , I could only act a caricature . I made myself up into what was meant for a wild exaggeration of the old Professor ’s dirty old self . When I went into the room full of his supporters I expected to be received with a roar of laughter , or ( if they were too far gone ) with a roar of indignation at the insult . I can not describe the surprise I felt when my entrance was received with a respectful silence , followed ( when I had first opened my lips ) with a murmur of admiration . The curse of the perfect artist had fallen upon me . I had been too subtle , I had been too true . They thought I really was the great Nihilist Professor . I was a healthy - minded young man at the time , and I confess that it was a blow . Before I could fully recover , however , two or three of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation , and told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next room . I inquired its nature . It seemed that an impertinent fellow had dressed himself up as a preposterous parody of myself . I had drunk more champagne than was good for me , and in a flash of folly I decided to see the situation through . Consequently it was to meet the glare of the company and my own lifted eyebrows and freezing eyes that the real Professor came into the room . “
31906	31907	31900	31900	him	616	” “
31910	31914	31900	31900	him	616	” said Syme , “
31944	31945	31937	31937	your	0	” “
31954	31959	31937	31937	your	0	” said the impersonator . “
32264	32273	32274	32274	I	0	” Syme laid down his knife and fork . “
32277	32281	32274	32274	I	0	” he said , “
32292	32302	32283	32283	you	0	” Professor de Worms nodded and drained his glass . “
32309	32322	32283	32283	you	0	” said the Professor sadly , as he set his glass down . “
32332	32336	32337	32337	you	2017	” said Syme ; “
32346	32347	32348	32348	You	2017	” “
32354	32360	32348	32348	You	2017	” said the Professor dismally , “
32493	32494	32474	32474	me	0	” “
32498	32502	32474	32474	me	0	” said Syme ; “
32521	32533	32514	32514	you	985	” The Professor started a little and looked at him steadily . “
32541	32545	32534	32534	You	985	” he said , “
32575	32595	32597	32597	you	985	” and he sank his bald brow in his two hands . Then he said in a low voice — “
32602	32603	32597	32597	you	985	” “
32606	32613	32597	32597	you	985	” said Syme in simple wonder , “
32623	32636	32637	32637	I	0	” Then , as the other did not speak , he added — “
32645	32663	32637	32637	I	0	” After a long silence , the Professor said out of the cavernous shadow of his hands — “
32678	32679	32637	32637	I	0	” “
32683	32687	32688	32688	you	985	” said Syme , “
32692	32693	32688	32688	you	985	” “
32698	32703	32696	32696	me	0	” said the other , “
32902	32903	32883	32883	he	995	” “
32908	32912	32905	32905	you	997	” said Syme , “
32928	32929	32921	32921	I	0	” “
32936	32941	32942	32942	I	0	” said his mentor . “
33006	33016	32988	32988	I	0	” and he rippled with his fingers on the wooden table—“B
33029	33135	33136	33136	We	1000	” Syme poured himself out another glass of wine , and began to study the scheme . He was abnormally quick with his brains at puzzles , and with his hands at conjuring , and it did not take him long to learn how he might convey simple messages by what would seem to be idle taps upon a table or knee . But wine and companionship had always the effect of inspiring him to a farcical ingenuity , and the Professor soon found himself struggling with the too vast energy of the new language , as it passed through the heated brain of Syme . “
33142	33145	33136	33136	We	1000	” said Syme seriously—“words
33170	33171	33168	33168	yours	1002	” “
33178	33184	33185	33185	You	1002	” said the Professor plaintively . “
33194	33195	33168	33168	yours	1002	” “
33202	33211	33168	33168	yours	1002	” said Syme , shaking his head sagaciously , “
33226	33227	33223	33223	you	1002	” “
33232	33238	33168	33168	yours	1002	” asked the Professor furiously , “
33251	33252	33246	33247	Dr. Bull	134	” “
33265	33270	33246	33247	Dr. Bull	134	” said Syme reflectively , “
33317	33319	33321	33321	you	1002	” ’ “
33324	33329	33321	33321	you	1002	” said the other , “
33336	33337	33321	33321	you	1002	” “
33340	33344	33321	33321	you	1002	” replied Syme ; “
33403	33404	33405	33405	Syme	85	” “
33407	33416	33405	33405	Syme	85	” said his friend with a stern simplicity , “
33421	33549	33405	33405	Syme	85	” Syme , however , sat up in bed for a considerable time mastering the new code . He was awakened next morning while the east was still sealed with darkness , and found his grey‑bearded ally standing like a ghost beside his bed . Syme sat up in bed blinking ; then slowly collected his thoughts , threw off the bed‑clothes , and stood up . It seemed to him in some curious way that all the safety and sociability of the night before fell with the bedclothes off him , and he stood up in an air of cold danger . He still felt an entire trust and loyalty towards his companion ; but it was the trust between two men going to the scaffold . “
33552	33566	33405	33405	Syme	85	” said Syme with a forced cheerfulness as he pulled on his trousers , “
33585	33613	33614	33614	I	0	” The Professor made no answer , but gazed in front of him with eyes the colour of a wintry sea ; so Syme repeated his question . “
33653	33675	33645	33645	you	1005	” The Professor was silent ; his eyes were wide open , and he wore a fixed but very small smile . “
33683	33690	33645	33645	you	1005	” The Professor did not move . “
33699	33936	33645	33645	you	1005	” called out Syme , in a sudden anger that had something like fear underneath . Whether or no the Professor could answer , he did not . Syme stood staring back at the stiff face like parchment and the blank , blue eyes . His first thought was that the Professor had gone mad , but his second thought was more frightful . After all , what did he know about this queer creature whom he had heedlessly accepted as a friend ? What did he know , except that the man had been at the anarchist breakfast and had told him a ridiculous tale ? How improbable it was that there should be another friend there beside Gogol ! Was this man ’s silence a sensational way of declaring war ? Was this adamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some threefold traitor , who had turned for the last time ? He stood and strained his ears in this heartless silence . He almost fancied he could hear dynamiters come to capture him shifting softly in the corridor outside . Then his eye strayed downwards , and he burst out laughing . Though the Professor himself stood there as voiceless as a statue , his five dumb fingers were dancing alive upon the dead table . Syme watched the twinkling movements of the talking hand , and read clearly the message — “
33951	33963	33944	33944	We	1006	” He rapped out the answer with the impatience of relief — “
33974	34645	34646	34646	I	0	” They took their hats and sticks in silence ; but as Syme took his sword‑stick , he held it hard . They paused for a few minutes only to stuff down coffee and coarse thick sandwiches at a coffee stall , and then made their way across the river , which under the grey and growing light looked as desolate as Acheron . They reached the bottom of the huge block of buildings which they had seen from across the river , and began in silence to mount the naked and numberless stone steps , only pausing now and then to make short remarks on the rail of the banisters . At about every other flight they passed a window ; each window showed them a pale and tragic dawn lifting itself laboriously over London . From each the innumerable roofs of slate looked like the leaden surges of a grey , troubled sea after rain . Syme was increasingly conscious that his new adventure had somehow a quality of cold sanity worse than the wild adventures of the past . Last night , for instance , the tall tenements had seemed to him like a tower in a dream . As he now went up the weary and perpetual steps , he was daunted and bewildered by their almost infinite series . But it was not the hot horror of a dream or of anything that might be exaggeration or delusion . Their infinity was more like the empty infinity of arithmetic , something unthinkable , yet necessary to thought . Or it was like the stunning statements of astronomy about the distance of the fixed stars . He was ascending the house of reason , a thing more hideous than unreason itself . By the time they reached Dr. Bull ’s landing , a last window showed them a harsh , white dawn edged with banks of a kind of coarse red , more like red clay than red cloud . And when they entered Dr. Bull ’s bare garret it was full of light . Syme had been haunted by a half historic memory in connection with these empty rooms and that austere daybreak . The moment he saw the garret and Dr. Bull sitting writing at a table , he remembered what the memory was — the French Revolution . There should have been the black outline of a guillotine against that heavy red and white of the morning . Dr. Bull was in his white shirt and black breeches only ; his cropped , dark head might well have just come out of its wig ; he might have been Marat or a more slipshod Robespierre . Yet when he was seen properly , the French fancy fell away . The Jacobins were idealists ; there was about this man a murderous materialism . His Dosition gave him a somewhat new appearance . The strong , white light of morning coming from one side creating sharp shadows , made him seem both more pale and more angular than he had looked at the breakfast on the balcony . Thus the two black glasses that encased his eyes might really have been black cavities in his skull , making him look like a death’s‑head . And , indeed , if ever Death himself sat writing at a wooden table , it might have been he . He looked up and smiled brightly enough as the men came in , and rose with the resilient rapidity of which the Professor had spoken . He set chairs for both of them , and going to a peg behind the door , proceeded to put on a coat and waistcoat of rough , dark tweed ; he buttoned it up neatly , and came back to sit down at his table . The quiet good humour of his manner left his two opponents helpless . It was with some momentary difficulty that the Professor broke silence and began , “
34657	34672	34673	34673	You	1007	” said he , with a careful resumption of the slow de Worms manner . “
34686	34694	34673	34673	You	1007	” Then he added with infinite slowness , “
34711	34737	34742	34742	me	0	” Dr. Bull smiled again , but continued to gaze on them without speaking . The Professor resumed , a pause before each weary word — “
34845	35081	35083	35083	I	0	” He was spinning out his sentences , making them intolerably long and lingering , in the hope of maddening the practical little Doctor into an explosion of impatience which might show his hand . But the little Doctor continued only to stare and smile , and the monologue was uphill work . Syme began to feel a new sickness and despair . The Doctor ’s smile and silence were not at all like the cataleptic stare and horrible silence which he had confronted in the Professor half an hour before . About the Professor ’s make­up and all his antics there was always something merely grotesque , like a gollywog . Syme remembered those wild woes of yesterday as one remembers being afraid of Bogy in childhood . But here was daylight ; here was a healthy , square‑shouldered man in tweeds , not odd save for the accident of his ugly spectacles , not glaring or grinning at all , but smiling steadily and not saying a word . The whole had a sense of unbearable reality . Under the increasing sunlight the colours of the Doctor ’s complexion , the pattern of his tweeds , grew and expanded outrageously , as such things grow too important in a realistic novel . But his smile was quite slight , the pose of his head polite ; the only uncanny thing was his silence . “
35086	35099	35083	35083	I	0	” resumed the Professor , like a man toiling through heavy sand , “
35145	35186	35187	35187	You	1013	” His words he seemed to be dragging out like words in an anthem ; but Syme , who was watching , saw his long fingers rattle quickly on the edge of the crazy table . He read the message , “
35199	35220	35192	35193	This devil	1014	” Syme plunged into the breach with that bravado of improvisation which always came to him when he was alarmed . “
35230	35235	35192	35193	This devil	1014	” he said hastily . “
35322	35364	35365	35365	Syme	113	” The Doctor was still smiling in the most friendly way , and his protected eyes were still impenetrable . The Professor signalled to Syme that he would resume his explanation , and he began again with the same elaborate calm . “
35399	35463	35464	35464	I	0	” All this time Syme had been staring at the Doctor almost as steadily as the Doctor stared at the Professor , but quite without the smile . The nerves of both comrades‑in‑arms were near snapping under that strain of motionless amiability , when Syme suddenly leant forward and idly tapped the edge of the table . His message to his ally ran , “
35469	35484	35464	35464	I	0	” The Professor , with scarcely a pause in his monologue , signalled back , “
35490	35494	35464	35464	I	0	” Syme telegraphed , “
35500	35505	35464	35464	I	0	” The other answered , “
35509	35513	35514	35514	I	0	” Syme said , “
35519	35524	35516	35517	a poet	197	” The other retorted , “
35531	35580	35525	35525	You	0	” Syme had gone quite red up to his yellow hair , and his eyes were burning feverishly . As he said he had an intuition , and it had risen to a sort of light­headed certainty . Resuming his symbolic taps , he signalled to his friend , “
35604	35620	35516	35517	a poet	197	” He then studied the answer on his friend ’s fingers . The answer was , “
35625	35639	35516	35517	a poet	197	” The Professor then resumed his merely verbal monologue addressed to the Doctor . “
35646	35653	35516	35517	a poet	197	” said Syme on his fingers , “
35674	35681	35516	35517	a poet	197	” His companion disdained to reply . “
35686	35690	35516	35517	a poet	197	” tapped Syme , “
35706	35742	35702	35704	a beautiful woman	1029	” The Professor was continuing his speech , but in the middle of it Syme decided to act . He leant across the table , and said in a voice that could not be neglected — “
35746	35774	35743	35744	Dr. Bull	134	” The Doctor ’s sleek and smiling head did not move , but they could have sworn that under his dark glasses his eyes darted towards Syme . “
35778	35790	35775	35776	Dr. Bull	134	” said Syme , in a voice peculiarly precise and courteous , “
35811	36069	35800	35800	you	134	” The Professor swung round on his seat , and stared at Syme with a sort of frozen fury of astonishment . Syme , like a man who has thrown his life and fortune on the table , leaned forward with a fiery face . The Doctor did not move . For a few seconds there was a silence in which one could hear a pin drop , split once by the single hoot of a distant steamer on the Thames . Then Dr. Bull rose slowly , still smiling , and took off his spectacles . Syme sprang to his feet , stepping backwards a little , like a chemical lecturer from a successful explosion . His eyes were like stars , and for an instant he could only point without speaking . The Professor had also started to his feet , forgetful of his supposed paralysis . He leant on the back of the chair and stared doubtfully at Dr. Bull , as if the Doctor had been turned into a toad before his eyes . And indeed it was almost as great a transformation scene . The two detectives saw sitting in the chair before them a very boyish‑looking young man , with very frank and happy hazel eyes , an open expression , cockney clothes like those of a city clerk , and an unquestionable breath about him of being very good and rather commonplace . The smile was still there , but it might have been the first smile of a baby . “
36077	36086	36070	36070	I	0	” cried Syme in a sort of ecstasy . “
36140	36141	36095	36096	the Pope	1031	” “
36150	36156	36095	36096	the Pope	1031	” said the Professor shakily . “
36166	36167	36163	36164	Dr. Bull	134	” “
36172	36179	36163	36164	Dr. Bull	134	” roared Syme , beside himself . “
36215	36216	36217	36217	Syme	113	” “
36219	36228	36217	36217	Syme	113	” cried the other in an apprehensive agony . “
36234	36238	36232	36232	God	95	” said Syme , “
36262	36323	36259	36259	my	0	” and he flung down the blue card upon the table . The Professor still feared that all was lost ; but he was loyal . He pulled out his own official card and put it beside his friend ’s . Then the third man burst out laughing , and for the first time that morning they heard his voice . “
36335	36346	36328	36328	you	1037	” he said , with a sort of schoolboy flippancy , “
36366	36438	36358	36358	I	0	” and he flicked a blue card towards them lightly as a matter of form . Clapping a brisk bowler on his head and resuming his goblin glasses , the Doctor moved so quickly towards the door , that the others instinctively followed him . Syme seemed a little distrait , and as he passed under the doorway he suddenly struck his stick on the stone passage so that it rang . “
36444	36449	36440	36442	Lord God Almighty	95	” he cried out , “
36471	36472	36464	36469	damned dynamiters at the damned Council	1041	” “
36479	36483	36484	36484	we	1039	” said Bull ; “
36490	36506	36484	36484	we	1039	” The Professor was descending the stairs , but his voice came up from below . “
36509	36514	36484	36484	we	1039	” said the voice , “
36534	36598	36528	36528	We	1039	” The others went down the stairs in silence . The young man called Bull , with an innocent courtesy characteristic of him , insisted on going last until they reached the street ; but there his own robust rapidity asserted itself unconsciously , and he walked quickly on ahead towards a railway inquiry office , talking to the others over his shoulder . “
36607	36611	36528	36528	We	1039	” he said . “
36657	36658	36644	36644	you	1044	” “
36667	36671	36644	36644	you	1044	” said Syme , “
36689	36696	36683	36683	you	1044	” The young man laughed delightedly . “
36703	36707	36683	36683	you	1044	” he said . “
37080	37081	37116	37116	he	1059	” “
37086	37090	37091	37091	I	0	” asked Syme . “
37096	37103	37091	37091	I	0	” answered the man in spectacles . “
37139	37148	37132	37132	he	1059	” Syme ’s eyes suddenly flashed on him . “
37153	37157	37132	37132	he	1059	” he asked . “
37165	37166	37160	37160	you	1063	” “
37171	37176	37168	37168	I	0	” said Bull brightly ; “

37206	37211	37199	37199	I	0	” said Syme gravely . “
37219	37292	37293	37293	I	0	” said the Professor . Their new ally was in practical matters a whirlwind . At the inquiry office he asked with businesslike brevity about the trains for Dover . Having got his information , he bundled the company into a cab , and put them and himself inside a railway carriage before they had properly realised the breathless process . They were already on the Calais boat before conversation flowed freely . “
37298	37302	37323	37323	You	1070	” he explained , “
37434	37435	37437	37437	you	1077	” “
37446	37451	37439	37440	the Marquis	745	” asked the Professor . “
37466	37467	37437	37437	you	1077	” “
37470	37476	37437	37437	you	1077	” answered the new guide , “
37493	37494	37483	37483	He	745	” “
37504	37509	37483	37483	He	745	” said the Professor , “
37517	37541	37544	37544	I	0	” At this question the countenance of Dr. Bull fell for the first time . He reflected a little , and then said — “
37554	37555	37557	37557	I	0	” “
37559	37563	37557	37557	I	0	” said Syme . “

37635	37640	37641	37641	I	0	” said the Professor . “
37705	37706	37707	37707	I	0	” “
37714	37719	37707	37707	I	0	” said Dr. Bull , “
37839	37840	37841	37841	I	0	” “
37849	37853	37841	37841	I	0	” said Syme . “
37865	37866	37863	37863	you	0	” “
37869	37874	37863	37863	you	0	” said Dr. Bull . “
37883	37923	37877	37877	you	0	” Dr. Bull smiled a little , and strolled across the deck to look at the sunlit sea . Then he strolled back again , kicking his heels carelessly , and a companionable silence fell between the three men . “
37926	37930	37877	37877	you	0	” said Syme , “
37957	37958	37967	37967	you	0	” “
37961	37966	37967	37967	you	0	” assented the Professor , “
37990	37991	37979	37979	I	0	” “
37999	38004	37979	37979	I	0	” said Syme seriously , “
38081	38082	38084	38089	one of those other three men	1105	” “
38091	38096	38084	38089	one of those other three men	1105	” said the Professor , “
38102	38118	38119	38119	My	0	” Syme nodded and was silent for a second or two , then he said — “
38328	38329	38334	38334	you	0	” “
38338	38343	38334	38334	you	0	” asked the Professor . “
38354	38358	38344	38345	The Symes	153	” said Syme ; “
38382	38383	38384	38384	He	745	” “
38391	38399	38384	38384	He	745	” said the little Doctor , staring . “
38403	38408	38384	38384	He	745	” continued Syme calmly , “
38429	38439	38440	38440	We	1117	” The Professor seized Syme roughly by the waistcoat . “
38445	38449	38440	38440	We	1117	” he said . “
38460	38461	38462	38462	My	0	” “
38469	38478	38462	38462	My	0	” answered Syme , in an unhurried manner . “
38546	38834	38835	38835	I	0	” They went on shore under the strong sun in a sort of daze . Syme , who had now taken the lead as Bull had taken it in London , led them along a kind of marine parade until he came to some cafés , embowered in a bulk of greenery and overlooking the sea . As he went before them his step was slightly swaggering , and he swung his stick like a sword . He was making apparently for the extreme end of the line of cafés , but he stopped abruptly . With a sharp gesture he motioned them to silence , but he pointed with one gloved finger to a café table under a bank of flowering foliage at which sat the Marquis de St. Eustache , his teeth shining in his thick , black beard , and his bold , brown face shadowed by a light yellow straw hat and outlined against the violet sea . SYME sat down at a café table with his companions , his blue eyes sparkling like the bright sea below , and ordered a bottle of Saumur with a pleased impatience . He was for some reason in a condition of curious hilarity . His spirits were already unnaturally high ; they rose as the Saumur sank , and in half an hour his talk was a torrent of nonsense . He professed to be making out a plan of the conversation which was going to ensue between himself and the deadly Marquis . He jotted it down wildly with a pencil . It was arranged like a printed catechism , with questions and answers , and was delivered with an extraordinary rapidity of utterance . “
38913	38914	38909	38910	the Syme	85	” “
38920	38927	38929	38929	yourself	0	” said the man in spectacles . “
38948	38949	38942	38942	you	0	” “
38957	38962	38965	38965	me	0	” said Syme pathetically . “
38998	38999	38989	38989	I	0	” “
39009	39016	38989	38989	I	0	” asked Dr. Bull in exasperation . “
39029	39035	39021	39021	my	0	” said Syme , beaming . “
39048	39049	39037	39038	the Marquis	745	” “
39059	39069	39037	39038	the Marquis	745	” asked the Professor , with a ponderous simplicity , “
39103	39113	39094	39094	your	0	” Syme struck the table with a radiant face . “
39121	39125	39094	39094	your	0	” he said , “
39149	39150	39143	39143	You	0	” “
39161	39166	39143	39143	You	0	” said the Doctor . “
39171	39177	39143	39143	You	0	” continued Syme quite unperturbed , “
39271	39531	39269	39269	George	121	” And he stood up suddenly , his yellow hair blowing in the slight sea breeze . A band was playing in a café chantant hidden somewhere among the trees , and a woman had just stopped singing . On Syme ’s heated head the bray of the brass band seemed like the jar and jingle of that barrel‑organ in Leicester Square , to the tune of which he had once stood up to die . He looked across to the little table where the Marquis sat . The man had two companions now , solemn Frenchmen in frock‑coats and silk hats , one of them with the red rosette of the Legion of Honour , evidently people of a solid social position . Besides these black , cylindrical costumes , the Marquis , in his loose straw hat and light spring clothes , looked Bohemian and even barbaric ; but he looked the Marquis . Indeed , one might say that he looked the king , with his animal elegance , his scornful eyes , and his proud head lifted against the purple sea . But he was no Christian king , at any rate ; he was , rather , some swarthy despot , half Greek , half Asiatic , who in the days when slavery seemed natural looked down on the Mediterranean , on his galley and his groaning slaves . Just so , Syme thought , would the brown‑gold face of such a tyrant have shown against the dark green olives and the burning blue . “
39540	39564	39565	39565	I	0	” asked the Professor peevishly , seeing that Syme still stood up without moving . Syme drained his last glass of sparkling wine . “
39568	39581	39565	39565	I	0	” he said , pointing across to the Marquis and his companions , “
39604	39633	39590	39590	I	0	” He stepped across swiftly , if not quite steadily . The Marquis , seeing him , arched his black Assyrian eyebrows in surprise , but smiled politely . “
39642	39649	39636	39637	Mr. Syme	85	” he said . Syme bowed . “
39659	39664	39651	39651	you	1134	” he said gracefully . “
39672	39704	39666	39666	me	0	” He leant over to do so , but the Marquis started backwards , upsetting his chair , and the two men in top hats held Syme back by the shoulders . “
39711	39720	39705	39706	This man	360	” said Syme , with gestures of explanation . “
39724	39733	39666	39666	me	0	” cried the gentleman with the red rosette , “
39736	39737	39749	39749	He	360	” “
39743	39748	39749	39749	He	360	” said Syme recklessly . “
39754	39755	39749	39749	He	360	” “
39760	39766	39757	39758	your mother	1137	” exclaimed the gentleman incredulously . “
39771	39779	39757	39758	your mother	1137	” said Syme , conceding a point , “
39783	39784	39757	39758	your mother	1137	” “
39797	39807	39788	39789	the Marquis	745	” said the second gentleman with some legitimate wonder . “
39817	39818	39808	39808	He	745	” “
39827	39832	39824	39824	he	745	” said Syme darkly . “
39839	39844	39833	39833	I	0	” said the Marquis , “
39861	39862	39851	39851	I	0	” “
39871	39876	39851	39851	I	0	” said Syme firmly . “
39897	39898	39889	39889	We	1144	” “
39904	39918	39889	39889	We	1144	” said the gentleman who was decoré , looking doubtfully at the Marquis . “
39925	39930	39921	39921	I	0	” said Syme earnestly , “
39948	39949	39934	39934	your	0	” “
39954	39960	39961	39961	I	0	” said the second gentleman . “
39984	39985	39978	39982	that girl with black hair	1146	” “
39993	39998	39999	40000	My aunt	1138	” said Syme indignantly . “
40005	40006	39999	40000	My aunt	1138	” “
40012	40017	39999	40000	My aunt	1138	” said the other , “
40030	40031	40019	40019	you	0	” “
40035	40046	40033	40033	George	121	” said Syme , facing round and looking at him , “
40054	40067	40048	40050	a clever chap	1149	” The Marquis started up with eyes flaming like a tiger ’s . “
40074	40078	40048	40050	a clever chap	1149	” he cried . “
40121	40130	40131	40131	Marquis	156	” Syme bowed with a quite beautiful graciousness . “
40133	40137	40131	40131	Marquis	156	” he said , “
40166	40229	40230	40230	I	0	” In three long strides he rejoined his companions , and they , who had seen his champagne‑inspired attack and listened to his idiotic explanations , were quite startled at the look of him . For now that he came back to them he was quite sober , a little pale , and he spoke in a low voice of passionate practicality . “
40235	40240	40241	40241	I	0	” he said hoarsely . “
40441	41042	40431	40431	me	0	” and leading them quickly across the parade , he presented them to the Marquis ’s seconds by two very aristocratic names of which they had not previously heard . Syme was subject to spasms of singular common sense , not otherwise a part of his character . They were ( as he said of his impulse about the spectacles ) poetic intuitions , and they sometimes rose to the exaltation of prophecy . He had correctly calculated in this case the policy of his opponent . When the Marquis was informed by his seconds that Syme could only fight in the morning , he must fully have realised that an obstacle had suddenly arisen between him and his bomb‑throwing business in the capital . Naturally he could not explain this objection to his friends , so he chose the course which Syme had predicted . He induced his seconds to settle on a small meadow not far from the railway , and he trusted to the fatality of the first engagement . When he came down very coolly to the field of honour , no one could have guessed that he had any anxiety about a journey ; his hands were in his pockets , his straw hat on the back of his head , his handsome face brazen in the sun . But it might have struck a stranger as odd that there appeared in his train , not only his seconds carrying the sword‑case , but two of his servants carrying a portmanteau and a luncheon basket . Early as was the hour , the sun soaked everything in warmth , and Syme was vaguely surprised to see so many spring flowers burning gold and silver in the tall grass in which the whole company stood almost knee - deep . With the exception of the Marquis , all the men were in sombre and solemn morning‑dress , with hats like black chimney‑pots ; the little Doctor especially , with the addition of his black spectacles , looked like an undertaker in a farce . Syme could not help feeling a comic contrast between this funereal church parade of apparel and the rich and glistening meadow , growing wild flowers everywhere . But , indeed , this comic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black hats was but a symbol of the tragic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black business . On his right was a little wood ; far away to his left lay the long curve of the railway line , which he was , so to speak , guarding from the Marquis , whose goal and escape it was . In front of him , behind the black group of his opponents , he could see , like a tinted cloud , a small almond bush in flower against the faint line of the sea . The member of the Legion of Honour , whose name it seemed was Colonel Ducroix , approached the Professor and Dr. Bull with great politeness , and suggested that the play should terminate with the first considerable hurt . Dr. Bull , however , having been carefully coached by Syme upon this point of policy , insisted , with great dignity and in very bad French , that it should continue until one of the combatants was disabled . Syme had made up his mind that he could avoid disabling the Marquis and prevent the Marquis from disabling him for at least twenty minutes . In twenty minutes the Paris train would have gone by . “
41058	41064	41044	41051	a man of the well‑known skill and valour	1160	” said the Professor solemnly , “
41112	41113	41109	41109	I	0	” “
41116	41129	41109	41109	I	0	“ broke from the Marquis behind , whose face had suddenly darkened , “
41137	41328	41109	41109	I	0	” and he slashed off the head of a tall flower with his stick . Syme understood his rude impatience and instinctively looked over his shoulder to see whether the train was coming in sight . But there was no smoke on the horizon . Colonel Ducroix knelt down and unlocked the case , taking out a pair of twin swords , which took the sunlight and turned to two streaks of white fire . He offered one to the Marquis , who snatched it without ceremony , and another to Syme , who took it , bent it , and poised it with as much delay as was consistent with dignity . Then the Colonel took out another pair of blades , and taking one himself and giving another to Dr. Bull , proceeded to place the men . Both combatants had thrown off their coats and waistcoats , and stood sword in hand . The seconds stood on each side of the line of fight with drawn swords also , but still sombre in their dark frock‑coats and hats . The principals saluted . The Colonel said quietly , “
41331	42472	41109	41109	I	0	” and the two blades touched and tingled . When the jar of the joined iron ran up Syme ’s arm , all the fantastic fears that have been the subject of this story fell from him like dreams from a man waking up in bed . He remembered them clearly and in order as mere delusions of the nerves — how the fear of the Professor had been the fear of the tyrannic accidents of nightmare , and how the fear of the Doctor had been the fear of the airless vacuum of science . The first was the old fear that any miracle might happen , the second the more hopeless modern fear that no miracle can ever happen . But he saw that these fears were fancies , for he found himself in the presence of the great fact of the fear of death , with its coarse and pitiless common sense . He felt like a man who had dreamed all night of falling over precipices , and had woke up on the morning when he was to be hanged . For as soon as he had seen the sunlight run down the channel of his foe ’s foreshortened blade , and as soon as he had felt the two tongues of steel touch , vibrating like two living things , he knew that his enemy was a terrible fighter , and that probably his last hour had come . He felt a strange and vivid value in all the earth around him , in the grass under his feet ; he felt the love of life in all living things . He could almost fancy that he heard the grass growing ; he could almost fancy that even as he stood fresh flowers were springing up and breaking into blossom in the meadow — flowers blood red and burning gold and blue , fulfilling the whole pageant of the spring . And whenever his eyes strayed for a flash from the calm , staring , hypnotic eyes of the Marquis , they saw the little tuft of almond tree against the sky‑line . He had the feeling that if by some miracle he escaped he would be ready to sit for ever before that almond tree , desiring nothing else in the world . But while earth and sky and everything had the living beauty of a thing lost , the other half of his head was as clear as glass , and he was parrying his enemy ’s point with a kind of clockwork skill of which he had hardly supposed himself capable . Once his enemy ’s point ran along his wrist , leaving a slight streak of blood , but it either was not noticed or was tacitly ignored . Every now and then he riposted , and once or twice he could almost fancy that he felt his point go home , but as there was no blood on blade or shirt he supposed he was mistaken . Then came an interruption and a change . At the risk of losing all , the Marquis , interrupting his quiet stare , flashed one glance over his shoulder at the line of railway on his right . Then he turned on Syme a face transfigured to that of a fiend , and began to fight as if with twenty weapons . The attack came so fast and furious , that the one shining sword seemed a shower of shining arrows . Syme had no chance to look at the railway ; but also he had no need . He could guess the reason of the Marquis ’s sudden madness of battle — the Paris train was in sight . But the Marquis ’s morbid energy over‑reached itself . Twice Syme , parrying , knocked his opponent ’s point far out of the fighting circle ; and the third time his riposte was so rapid , that there was no doubt about the hit this time . Syme ’s sword actually bent under the weight of the Marquis ’s body , which it had pierced . Syme was as certain that he had stuck his blade into his enemy as a gardener that he has stuck his spade into the ground . Yet the Marquis sprang back from the stroke without a stagger , and Syme stood staring at his own sword‑point like an idiot . There was no blood on it at all . There was an instant of rigid silence , and then Syme in his turn fell furiously on the other , filled with a flaming curiosity . The Marquis was probably , in a general sense , a better fencer than he , as he had surmised at the beginning , but at the moment the Marquis seemed distraught and at a disadvantage . He fought wildly and even weakly , and he constantly looked away at the railway line , almost as if he feared the train more than the pointed steel . Syme , on the other hand , fought fiercely but still carefully , in an intellectual fury , eager to solve the riddle of his own bloodless sword . For this purpose , he aimed less at the Marquis ’s body , and more at his throat and head . A minute and a half afterwards he felt his point enter the man ’s neck below the jaw . It came out clean . Half mad , he thrust again , and made what should have been a bloody scar on the Marquis ’s cheek . But there was no scar . For one moment the heaven of Syme again grew black with supernatural terrors . Surely the man had a charmed life . But this new spiritual dread was a more awful thing than had been the mere spiritual topsy - turvydom symbolised by the paralytic who pursued him . The Professor was only a goblin ; this man was a devil — perhaps he was the Devil ! Anyhow , this was certain , that three times had a human sword been driven into him and made no mark . When Syme had that thought he drew himself up , and all that was good in him sang high up in the air as a high wind sings in the trees . He thought of all the human things in his story — of the Chinese lanterns in Saffron Park , of the girl ’s red hair in the garden , of the honest , beer‑swilling sailors down by the dock , of his loyal companions standing by . Perhaps he had been chosen as a champion of all these fresh and kindly things to cross swords with the enemy of all creation . “
42476	42482	41109	41109	I	0	” he said to himself , “
42512	42679	42508	42508	I	0	” and as the word went through his head , he heard a faint and far‑off hoot , which would soon be the roar of the Paris train . He fell to fighting again with a supernatural levity , like a Mohammedan panting for Paradise . As the train came nearer and nearer he fancied he could see people putting up the floral arches in Paris ; he joined in the growing noise and the glory of the great Republic whose gate he was guarding against Hell . His thoughts rose higher and higher with the rising roar of the train , which ended , as if proudly , in a long and piercing whistle . The train stopped . Suddenly , to the astonishment of everyone the Marquis sprang back quite out of sword reach and threw down his sword . The leap was wonderful , and not the less wonderful because Syme had plunged his sword a moment before into the man ’s thigh . “
42682	42695	42696	42696	I	0	” said the Marquis in a voice that compelled a momentary obedience . “
42702	42703	42696	42696	I	0	” “
42709	42716	42696	42696	I	0	” asked Colonel Ducroix , staring . “
42723	42724	42696	42696	I	0	” “
42732	42743	42696	42696	I	0	” said Dr. Bull , who was a little pale . “
42762	42777	42756	42756	he	745	” The Marquis put up his hand with a curious air of ghastly patience . “
42783	42787	42756	42756	he	745	” he said . “
42796	42805	42793	42794	Mr. Syme	85	” he continued , turning to his opponent , “
42853	42854	42855	42855	I	0	” “
42863	42869	42855	42855	I	0	” said Dr. Bull indignantly . “
42878	42889	42855	42855	I	0	” said Colonel Ducroix , looking wistfully at his principal . “
42940	42941	42930	42930	one	225	” “
42952	42959	42943	42943	you	85	” said the Marquis in exasperation . “
43006	43154	43004	43004	you	85	” and he bent slightly forward with a fascinating smile . The Paris train , panting and groaning , had grated into a little station behind the neighbouring hill . Syme had the feeling he had more than once had in these adventures — the sense that a horrible and sublime wave lifted to heaven was just toppling over . Walking in a world he half understood , he took two paces forward and seized the Roman nose of this remarkable nobleman . He pulled it hard , and it came off in his hand . He stood for some seconds with a foolish solemnity , with the pasteboard proboscis still between his fingers , looking at it , while the sun and the clouds and the wooded hills looked down upon this imbecile scene . The Marquis broke the silence in a loud and cheerful voice . “
43165	43169	43170	43170	he	363	” he said , “
43198	43236	43175	43176	Colonel Ducroix	158	” and he gravely tore off one of his swarthy Assyrian brows , bringing about half his brown forehead with it , and politely offered it to the Colonel , who stood crimson and speechless with rage . “
43242	43246	43238	43238	I	0	” he spluttered , “
43260	43261	43248	43248	I	0	” “
43270	43288	43267	43267	I	0	” said the Marquis , recklessly throwing various parts of himself right and left about the field . “
43315	43316	43304	43304	I	0	” “
43319	43325	43304	43304	I	0	” said Dr. Bull fiercely , “
43353	43393	43395	43395	you	158	” The mysterious Marquis lifted his hands with a desperate gesture . He was a strange scarecrow standing there in the sun with half his old face peeled off , and half another face glaring and grinning from underneath . “
43400	43404	43395	43395	you	158	” he cried . “
43408	43409	43395	43395	you	158	” “
43418	43448	43449	43449	You	158	” said Syme firmly , and grasped his sword . The wild figure turned towards Syme , and seemed to be gathering itself for a sublime effort before speaking . “
43470	43477	43478	43478	You	158	” he said without taking breath . “
43489	43490	43487	43487	You	158	” “
43499	43503	43491	43491	You	158	” repeated Syme . “
43510	43515	43517	43517	I	0	” roared the other , “
43525	43526	43517	43517	I	0	” “
43531	43537	43517	43517	I	0	” said the Professor sternly . “
43548	43549	43538	43538	You	158	” “
43558	43572	43552	43552	Jericho	162	” cried the other , tearing his hair , which came off easily . “
43615	43616	43592	43592	you	1188	” “
43624	43629	43620	43620	you	1188	” began the Professor . “
43665	43666	43667	43667	I	0	” “
43673	43679	43667	43667	I	0	” said Syme with restraint , “
43757	43758	43748	43748	I	0	” “
43763	43768	43728	43728	you	1188	” said the other , “
43786	43787	43775	43775	Sunday	107	” “
43790	43799	43775	43775	Sunday	107	” repeated the Professor , as if stupefied . “
43809	43810	43802	43802	you	1188	” “
43817	43860	43802	43802	you	1188	” said the Marquis , and tore off his scalp and half his face . The head which emerged was the blonde , well brushed , smooth‑haired head which is common in the English constabulary , but the face was terribly pale . “
43866	43880	43861	43861	I	0	” he said , with a sort of haste that verged on harshness . “
43917	43937	43913	43913	I	0	” and he began to pull a blue card from his pocket . The Professor gave a tired gesture . “
43946	43951	43944	43944	us	1194	” he said wearily ; “
43963	44028	44029	44029	Gentlemen	733	” The little man named Bull , had , like many men who seem to be of a mere vivacious vulgarity , sudden movements of good taste . Here he certainly saved the situation . In the midst of this staggering transformation scene he stepped forward with all the gravity and responsibility of a second , and addressed the two seconds of the Marquis . “
44031	44035	44029	44029	Gentlemen	733	” he said , “
44198	44220	44230	44230	you	733	” The younger second of the Marquis , a short man with a black moustache , bowed politely , and said — “
44323	44341	44312	44312	I	0	” Colonel Ducroix moved mechanically , but then tugged abruptly at his white moustache and broke out — “
44393	44411	44386	44386	I	0	” Dr. Bull took off his hat and waved it , cheering as at a public meeting . “
44419	44424	44386	44386	I	0	” said Inspector Ratcliffe , “
44430	44431	44425	44425	Sunday	107	” “
44434	44443	44425	44425	Sunday	107	” cried Bull , and dropped his hat . “
44446	44450	44425	44425	Sunday	107	” retorted Ratcliffe , “
44457	44458	44451	44451	he	107	” “
44462	44466	44451	44451	he	107	” asked Syme . “
44475	44480	44451	44451	he	107	” said the other . “
44488	44492	44482	44482	you	733	” began Syme . “
44506	44524	44526	44526	God	95	” he cried out suddenly , like a man who sees an explosion a long way off , “
44565	44566	44589	44589	you	733	” “
44569	44578	44589	44589	you	733	” said the new policeman with incredible violence . “
44677	44690	44697	44697	him	107	” and he pointed a shaking finger towards the small wayside station . “
44816	44817	44780	44780	he	107	” “
44820	44829	44780	44780	he	107	” asked Syme with a sort of steadiness . “
44832	44840	44841	44841	he	107	” replied the other with sudden serenity , “
44925	44973	44912	44912	Sunday	107	” Syme uttered an involuntary cry , and they all turned their eyes towards the far‑off station . It was quite true that a considerable bulk of people seemed to be moving in their direction . But they were too distant to be dis­tinguished in any way . “
44986	44997	44981	44984	Marquis de St. Eustache	129	” said the new policeman , producing a leather case , “
45067	45090	45053	45053	you	134	” He handed the field‑glasses to the Doctor , who immediately took off his spectacles and put the apparatus to his eyes . “
45101	45109	45098	45098	you	134	” said the Professor , somewhat shaken . “
45127	45128	45124	45125	ordinary tourists	1251	” “
45133	45144	45130	45131	ordinary tourists	1251	” asked Bull , with the fieldglasses to his eyes , “
45153	45269	45124	45125	ordinary tourists	1251	” Syme almost tore the glasses out of his hand , and looked through them . Most men in the advancing mob really looked ordinary enough ; but it was quite true that two or three of the leaders in front wore black half‑masks almost down to their mouths . This disguise is very complete , especially at such a distance , and Syme found it impossible to conclude anything from the clean - shaven jaws and chins of the men talking in the front . But presently as they talked they all smiled and one of them smiled on one side . SYME put the field‑glasses from his eyes with an almost ghastly relief . “
45279	45288	45270	45271	The President	2320	” he said , and wiped his forehead . “
45299	45318	45291	45291	they	1250	” said the bewildered Colonel , blinking and but half recovered from Bull ’s hasty though polite explanation . “
45330	45331	45320	45320	you	1254	” “
45343	45349	45351	45351	you	1254	” answered Syme somewhat irritably . “
45382	45398	45375	45375	I	0	” After an instant ’s pause the new man called Ratcliffe said with gloomy decision — “
45438	45439	45418	45419	the President	2320	” “
45444	45448	45418	45419	the President	2320	” said Syme . “
45476	45493	45510	45510	they	1264	” he added , frowning dubiously at the distant fields that lay towards the little station , “
45521	45522	45525	45525	they	1264	” “
45527	45534	45525	45525	they	1264	” said the new detective contemptuously ; “
45611	45630	45607	45609	his private secretary	1270	” and he spat on the grass . Then he turned to the others and said somewhat austerely — “
45662	46287	46289	46289	I	0	” With these words , he turned his broad back and strode with silent energy towards the wood . The others gave one glance over their shoulders , and saw that the dark cloud of men had detached itself from the station and was moving with a mysterious discipline across the plain . They saw already , even with the naked eye , black blots on the foremost faces , which marked the masks they wore . They turned and followed their leader , who had already struck the wood , and disappeared among the twinkling trees . The sun on the grass was dry and hot . So in plunging into the wood they had a cool shock of shadow , as of divers who plunge into a dim pool . The inside of the wood was full of shattered sunlight and shaken shadows . They made a sort of shuddering veil , almost recalling the dizziness of a cinematograph . Even the solid figures walking with him Syme could hardly see for the patterns of sun and shade that danced upon them . Now a man ’s head was lit as with a light of Rembrandt , leaving all else obliterated ; now again he had strong and staring white hands with the face of a negro . The ex‑Marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes , and the black shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it seemed to be wearing one of the black half - masks of their pursuers . The fancy tinted Syme ’s overwhelming sense of wonder . Was he wearing a mask ? Was anyone wearing a mask ? Was anyone anything ? This wood of witchery , in which men ’s faces turned black and white by turns , in which their figures first swelled into sunlight and then faded into formless night , this mere chaos of chiaroscuro ( after the clear daylight outside ) , seemed to Syme a perfect symbol of the world in which he had been moving for three days , this world where men took off their beards and their spectacles and their noses , and turned into other people . That tragic self‑confidence which he had felt when he believed that the Marquis was a devil had strangely disappeared now that he knew that the Marquis was a friend . He felt almost inclined to ask after all these bewilderments what was a friend and what an enemy . Was there anything that was apart from what it seemed ? The Marquis had taken off his nose and turned out to be a detective . Might he not just as well take off his head and turn out to be a hobgoblin ? Was not everything , after all , like this bewildering woodland , this dance of dark and light ? Everything only a glimpse , the glimpse always unforeseen , and always forgotten . For Gabriel Syme had found in the heart of that sun - splashed wood what many modern painters had found there . He had found the thing which the modern people call Impressionism , which is another name for that final scepticism which can find no floor to the universe . As a man in an evil dream strains himself to scream and wake , Syme strove with a sudden effort to fling off this last and worst of his fancies . With two impatient strides he overtook the man in the Marquis ’s straw hat , the man whom he had come to address as Ratcliffe . In a voice exaggeratively loud and cheerful , he broke the bottomless silence and made conversation . “
46292	46296	46289	46289	I	0	” he said , “
46306	46334	46335	46335	We	1272	” So genuine had been the doubts of his soul , that he was quite glad to hear his companion speak in an easy , human voice . “
46348	46352	46353	46353	I	0	” he said . “
46368	46369	46353	46353	I	0	” “
46378	46382	46372	46372	you	0	” cried Syme . “
46419	46420	46421	46422	Mere mobs	1281	” “
46424	46435	46421	46422	Mere mobs	1281	” repeated his new friend with a snort of scorn . “
46565	46566	46553	46553	anarchists	2124	” “
46578	46582	46553	46553	anarchists	2124	” said Syme , “
46598	46599	46590	46590	I	0	” “
46604	46609	46590	46590	I	0	” said his informant , “
46658	46659	46660	46660	Millionaires	1309	” “
46665	46670	46671	46671	they	1309	” said Syme thoughtfully , “
46731	46732	46715	46715	Sunday	107	” “
46735	46740	46715	46715	Sunday	107	” said the other , “
46751	46752	46748	46748	you	0	” “
46758	46762	46763	46763	he	1305	” said Syme , “
46770	46951	46952	46953	Mr. Syme	85	” and he pointed straight in front of him . They had come to an open space of sunlight , which seemed to express to Syme the final return of his own good sense ; and in the middle of this forest clearing was a figure that might well stand for that common sense in an almost awful actuality . Burnt by the sun and stained with perspiration , and grave with the bottomless gravity of small necessary toils , a heavy French peasant was cutting wood with a hatchet . His cart stood a few yards off , already half full of timber ; and the horse that cropped the grass was , like his master , valorous but not desperate ; like his master , he was even prosperous , but yet was almost sad . The man was a Norman , taller than the average of the French and very angular ; and his swarthy figure stood dark against a square of sunlight , almost like some allegoric figure of labour frescoed on a ground of gold . “
46957	46966	46952	46953	Mr. Syme	85	” called out Ratcliffe to the French Colonel , “
46980	46981	46952	46953	Mr. Syme	85	” “
46989	46996	46982	46983	Mr. Syme	85	” answered Colonel Ducroix , laughing , “
47027	47028	47018	47018	you	85	” “
47033	47039	47029	47029	He	85	” said Dr. Bull doubtfully . “
47043	47048	47018	47018	you	85	” said the Colonel ; “
47056	47057	47058	47058	I	0	” “
47063	47070	47058	47058	I	0	” called out Dr. Bull suddenly ; “
47100	47101	47074	47074	he	85	” “
47108	47113	47074	47074	he	85	” said Syme eagerly . “
47122	47123	47114	47114	I	0	” “
47129	47134	47135	47135	he	85	” said the Colonel ; “
47149	47150	47154	47154	he	85	” “
47157	47162	47154	47154	he	85	” began Bull impatiently . “
47172	47177	47166	47166	he	85	” said the other . “
47198	47645	47192	47192	He	85	” And even while they seemed to hear the heavy feet of their strange pursuers behind them , they had to stand and stamp while the French Colonel talked to the French wood‑cutter with all the leisurely badinage and bickering of market‑day . At the end of the four minutes , however , they saw that the Colonel was right , for the wood‑cutter entered into their plans , not with the vague servility of a tout too‑well paid , but with the seriousness of a solicitor who had been paid the proper fee . He told them that the best thing they could do was to make their way down to the little inn on the hills above Lancy , where the innkeeper , an old soldier who had become dévot in his latter years , would be certain to sympathise with them , and even to take risks in their support . The whole company , therefore , piled themselves on top of the stacks of wood , and went rocking in the rude cart down the other and steeper side of the woodland . Heavy and ramshackle as was the vehicle , it was driven quickly enough , and they soon had the exhilarating impression of distancing altogether those , whoever they were , who were hunting them . For , after all , the riddle as to where the anarchists had got all these followers was still unsolved . One man ’s presence had sufficed for them ; they had fled at the first sight of the deformed smile of the Secretary . Syme every now and then looked back over his shoulder at the army on their track . As the wood grew first thinner and then smaller with distance , he could see the sunlit slopes beyond it and above it ; and across these was still moving the square black mob like one monstrous beetle . In the very strong sunlight and with his own very strong eyes , which were almost telescopic , Syme could see this mass of men quite plainly . He could see them as separate human figures ; but he was increasingly surprised by the way in which they moved as one man . They seemed to be dressed in dark clothes and plain hats , like any common crowd out of the streets ; but they did not spread and sprawl and trail by various lines to the attack , as would be natural in an ordinary mob . They moved with a sort of dreadful and wicked woodenness , like a staring army of automatons . Syme pointed this out to Ratcliffe . “
47648	47653	47192	47192	He	85	” replied the policeman , “
47725	47925	48131	48131	I	0	” Syme nodded . It was true that the black patch of the pursuing men was growing smaller and smaller as the peasant belaboured his horse . The level of the sunlit landscape , though flat as a whole , fell away on the farther side of the wood in billows of heavy slope towards the sea , in a way not unlike the lower slopes of the Sussex downs . The only difference was that in Sussex the road would have been broken and angular like a little brook , but here the white French road fell sheer in front of them like a waterfall . Down this direct descent the cart clattered at a considerable angle , and in a few minutes , the road growing yet steeper , they saw below them the little harbour of Lancy and a great blue arc of the sea . The travelling cloud of their enemies had wholly disappeared from the horizon . The horse and cart took a sharp turn round a clump of elms , and the horse ’s nose nearly struck the face of an old gentleman who was sitting on the benches outside the little café of “
47930	48129	48131	48131	I	0	” The peasant grunted an apology , and got down from his seat . The others also descended one by one , and spoke to the old gentleman with fragmentary phrases of courtesy , for it was quite evident from his expansive manner that he was the owner of the little tavern . He was a white‑haired , apple‑faced old boy , with sleepy eyes and a grey moustache ; stout , sedentary , and very innocent , of a type that may often be found in France , but is still commoner in Catholic Germany . Everything about him , his pipe , his pot of beer , his flowers , and his beehive , suggested an ancestral peace ; only when his visitors looked up as they entered the inn-­parlour , they saw the sword upon the wall . The Colonel , who greeted the innkeeper as an old friend , passed rapidly into the inn‑parlour , and sat down ordering some ritual refreshment . The military decision of his action interested Syme , who sat next to him , and he took the opportunity when the old innkeeper had gone out of satisfying his curiosity . “
48137	48145	48131	48131	I	0	” he said in a low voice , “
48152	48162	48131	48131	I	0	” Colonel Ducroix smiled behind his bristly white moustache . “
48169	48173	48175	48175	I	0	” he said ; “
48209	48210	48190	48190	We	1327	” “
48213	48221	48190	48190	We	1327	” repeated Syme , looking up quickly . “
48224	48229	48190	48190	We	1327	” replied the other ; “
48259	48260	48250	48250	you	2017	” “
48271	48276	48264	48264	you	158	” asked Syme doubtfully . “
48280	48285	48264	48264	you	158	” replied the Colonel , “
48344	48354	48327	48327	he	1334	” Syme nodded gravely ; then he said abruptly — “
48363	48364	48356	48356	your	158	” “
48372	48377	48365	48365	My	0	” said Ducroix soberly , “
48400	48423	48424	48424	You	158	” Syme looked up at the wall , and saw a crudely - painted and pathetic religious picture . Then he said — “
48428	48435	48424	48424	You	158	” and then almost immediately afterwards , “
48443	48444	48437	48437	anyone	363	” “
48447	48451	48437	48437	anyone	363	” answered Ducroix , “
48510	48903	48502	48502	You	2017	” Almost as he spoke , the old innkeeper with the blue eyes and white hair came ambling into the room , and announced that six horses were saddled outside . By Ducroix ’s advice the five others equipped themselves with some portable form of food and wine , and keeping their duelling swords as the only weapons available , they clattered away down the steep , white road . The two servants , who had carried the Marquis ’s luggage when he was a marquis , were left behind to drink at the café by common consent , and not at all against their own inclination . By this time the afternoon sun was slanting westward , and by its rays Syme could see the sturdy figure of the old innkeeper growing smaller and smaller , but still standing and looking after them quite silently , the sunshine in his silver hair . Syme had a fixed , superstitious fancy , left in his mind by the chance phrase of the Colonel , that this was indeed , perhaps , the last honest stranger whom he should ever see upon the earth . He was still looking at this dwindling figure , which stood as a mere grey blot touched with a white flame against the great green wall of the steep down behind him . And as he stared over the top of the down behind the innkeeper , there appeared an army of black‑clad and marching men . They seemed to hang above the good man and his house like a black cloud of locusts . The horses had been saddled none too soon . URGING the horses to a gallop , without respect to the rather rugged descent of the road , the horsemen soon regained their advantage over the men on the march , and at last the bulk of the first buildings of Lancy cut off the sight of their pursuers . Nevertheless , the ride had been a long one , and by the time they reached the real town the west was warming with the colour and quality of sunset . The Colonel suggested that , before making finally for the police station , they should make the effort , in passing , to attach to themselves one more individual who might be useful . “
48915	48919	48936	48937	The fifth	1349	” he said , “
48967	48968	48962	48962	he	1349	” “
48973	49001	48962	48962	he	1349	” said the Professor in his mirthful way , looking back along the white road on which the black , crawling patch might appear at any moment , “
49013	49014	49015	49016	Doctor Renard	150	” “
49025	49030	49015	49016	Doctor Renard	150	” said the Colonel . “
49034	49039	49015	49016	Doctor Renard	150	” said Dr. Bull , “
49046	49047	49015	49016	Doctor Renard	150	” “
49050	49054	49015	49016	Doctor Renard	150	” said Syme , “
49072	49073	49074	49074	He	150	” “
49079	49084	49074	49074	He	150	” said the Colonel . “
49092	49096	49099	49099	he	150	” said Bull . “
49106	49107	49099	49099	he	150	” “
49114	49115	49099	49099	he	150	” “
49120	49125	49117	49117	your	1357	” said Syme suddenly . “
49131	49214	49215	49215	They	1355	” For a second they all sat as still as equestrian statues , and for a second — for two or three or four seconds — heaven and earth seemed equally still . Then all their ears , in an agony of attention , heard along the road that indescribable thrill and throb that means only one thing — horses ! The Colonel ’s face had an instantaneous change , as if lightning had struck it , and yet left it scatheless . “
49220	49229	49215	49215	They	1355	” he said , with brief military irony . “
49235	49236	49215	49215	They	1355	” “
49245	49275	49276	49276	I	0	” asked Syme , as he mechanically urged his steed to a canter . The Colonel was silent for a little , then he said in a strained voice — “
49304	49305	49283	49283	I	0	” “
49308	49313	49318	49318	he	1360	” said Syme violently , “
49330	49331	49332	49332	He	1360	” “
49338	49344	49332	49332	He	1360	” said the Colonel gently . “
49372	49561	49562	49562	Anarchy	166	” With these words he swung his horse suddenly round a street corner , and went down the street with such thundering speed , that the others , though already well at the gallop , had difficulty in following the flying tail of his horse . Dr. Renard inhabited a high and comfortable house at the top of a steep street , so that when the riders alighted at his door they could once more see the solid green ridge of the hill , with the white road across it , standing up above all the roofs of the town . They breathed again to see that the road as yet was clear , and they rang the bell . Dr. Renard was a beaming , brown‑bearded man , a good example of that silent but very busy professional class which France has preserved even more perfectly than England . When the matter was explained to him he pooh - poohed the panic of the ex‑Marquis altogether ; he said , with the solid French scepticism , that there was no conceivable probability of a general anarchist rising . “
49564	49572	49562	49562	Anarchy	166	” he said , shrugging his shoulders , “
49577	49578	49562	49562	Anarchy	166	” “
49582	49596	49562	49562	Anarchy	166	” cried out the Colonel suddenly , pointing over the other ’s shoulder , “
49606	49786	49787	49787	I	0	” They all looked round , and saw a curve of black cavalry come sweeping over the top of the hill with all the energy of Attila . Swiftly as they rode , however , the whole rank still kept well together , and they could see the black vizards of the first line as level as a line of uniforms . But although the main black square was the same , though travelling faster , there was now one sensational difference which they could see clearly upon the slope of the hill , as if upon a slanted map . The bulk of the riders were in one block ; but one rider flew far ahead of the column , and with frantic movements of hand and heel urged his horse faster and faster , so that one might have fancied that he was not the pursuer but the pursued . But even at that great distance they could see something so fanatical , so unquestionable in his figure , that they knew it was the Secretary himself . “
49797	49802	49787	49787	I	0	” said the Colonel , “
49816	49817	49805	49805	you	0	” “
49828	49836	49818	49818	I	0	” said Dr. Renard , smiling sociably ; “
49857	50020	49787	49787	I	0	” Dr. Renard was a mild man with monstrous wealth ; his rooms were like the Musée de Cluny , and he had three motor‑cars . These , however , he seemed to use very sparingly , having the simple tastes of the French middle class , and when his impatient friends came to examine them , it took them some time to assure themselves that one of them even could be made to work . This with some difficulty they brought round into the street before the Doctor ’s house . When they came out of the dim garage they were startled to find that twilight had already fallen with the abruptness of night in the tropics . Either they had been longer in the place than they imagined , or some unusual canopy of cloud had gathered over the town . They looked down the steep streets , and seemed to see a slight mist coming up from the sea . “
50027	50032	50033	50033	I	0	” said Dr. Bull . “
50037	50038	50033	50033	I	0	” “
50041	50046	50033	50033	I	0	” corrected the Professor , “
50050	50163	50164	50164	I	0	” And as they listened , it was evident that the noise , rapidly coming nearer on the rattling stones , was not the noise of the whole cavalcade but that of the one horseman , who had left it far behind — the insane Secretary . Syme ’s family , like most of those who end in the simple life , had once owned a motor , and he knew all about them . He had leapt at once into the chauffeur ’s seat , and with flushed face was wrenching and tugging at the disused machinery . He bent his strength upon one handle , and then said quite quietly — “
50172	50371	50372	50372	I	0	” As he spoke , there swept round the corner a man rigid on his rushing horse , with the rush and rigidity of an arrow . He had a smile that thrust out his chin as if it were dislocated . He swept alongside of the stationary car , into which its company had crowded , and laid his hand on the front . It was the Secretary , and his mouth went quite straight in the solemnity of triumph . Syme was leaning hard upon the steering wheel , and there was no sound but the rumble of the other pursuers riding into the town . Then there came quite suddenly a scream of scraping iron , and the car leapt forward . It plucked the Secretary clean out of his saddle , as a knife is whipped out of its sheath , trailed him kicking terribly for twenty yards , and left him flung flat upon the road far in front of his frightened horse . As the car took the corner of the street with a splendid curve , they could just see the other anarchists filling the street and raising their fallen leader . “
50383	50394	50401	50401	I	0	” said the Professor at last in a low voice . “
50404	50409	50401	50401	I	0	” said Dr. Bull . “
50433	50434	50435	50435	We	1365	” “
50438	50504	50435	50435	We	1365	” said the Colonel , and from the floor of the car he fished up a heavy , old‑fashioned , carved iron lantern with a light inside it . It was obviously an antique , and it would seem as if its original use had been in some way semi‑religious , for there was a rude moulding of a cross upon one of its sides . “
50513	50518	50509	50509	you	1367	” asked the Professor . “
50528	50535	50523	50523	I	0	” answered the Colonel , chuckling , “
50696	50697	50698	50698	You	0	” “
50701	50824	50698	50698	You	0	” said Syme seriously , and hung the heavy lantern over the front . There was a certain allegory of their whole position in the contrast between the modern automobile and its strange ecclesiastical lamp . Hitherto they had passed through the quietest part of the town , meeting at most one or two pedestrians , who could give them no hint of the peace or the hostility of the place . Now , however , the windows in the houses began one by one to be lit up , giving a greater sense of habitation and humanity . Dr. Bull turned to the new detective who had led their flight , and permitted himself one of his natural and friendly smiles . “
50833	50841	50828	50828	one	225	” Inspector Ratcliffe drew his brows together . “
50855	50859	50828	50828	one	225	” he said , “
50887	50903	50828	50828	one	225	” Then all Bull ’s boiling good sense and optimism broke suddenly out of him . “
50912	50916	50828	50828	one	225	” he cried . “
50955	50956	50977	50977	We	1381	” “
50959	50968	50977	50977	We	1381	” said the other with an immovable simplicity , “
50995	51001	51002	51002	he	805	“ What is that noise ? ”
51005	51016	51018	51019	the Colonel	2828	“ Oh , the horses behind us , I suppose , ”
51021	51031	51018	51019	the Colonel	2828	“ I thought we had got clear of them . ”
51032	51040	51042	51043	the Professor	805	“ The horses behind us ! No , ”
51045	51058	51042	51043	the Professor	805	“ it is not horses , and it is not behind us . ”
51121	51129	51130	51130	he	805	“ I tell you they were his , ”
51137	51147	51130	51130	he	805	“ and they were full of men in masks ! ”
51148	51151	51153	51154	the Colonel	2828	“ Absurd ! ”
51157	51167	51153	51154	the Colonel	2828	“ Dr. Renard would never give them his cars . ”
51168	51175	51177	51177	Ratcliffe	163	“ He may have been forced , ”
51180	51189	51177	51177	Ratcliffe	163	“ The whole town is on their side . ”
51190	51196	51198	51199	the Colonel	2828	“ You still believe that , ”
51202	51210	51212	51213	the other	279	“ You will all believe it soon , ”
51237	51260	51231	51232	the Colonel	2828	“ No , I ca n’t believe it . The thing is nonsense . The plain people of a peaceable French town — ”
51308	51312	51314	51315	the Colonel	2828	“ My God ! ”
51317	51324	51314	51315	the Colonel	2828	“ someone has shot at us . ”
51325	51332	51334	51336	the gloomy Ratcliffe	163	“ It need not interrupt conversation , ”
51338	51363	51334	51336	the gloomy Ratcliffe	163	“ Pray resume your remarks , Colonel . You were talking , I think , about the plain people of a peaceable French town . ”
51382	51387	51388	51388	he	85	“ It is extraordinary , ”
51391	51395	51388	51388	he	85	“ most extraordinary . ”
51396	51401	51403	51403	Syme	85	“ A fastidious person , ”
51405	51435	51403	51403	Syme	85	“ might even call it unpleasant . However , I suppose those lights out in the field beyond this street are the Gendarmerie . We shall soon get there . ”
51436	51439	51441	51442	Inspector Ratcliffe	163	“ No , ”
51444	51451	51441	51442	Inspector Ratcliffe	163	“ we shall never get there . ”
51478	51484	51486	51486	Bull	134	“ What do you mean ? ”
51489	51499	51501	51502	the pessimist	1408	“ I mean that we shall never get there , ”
51505	51550	51501	51502	the pessimist	1408	“ They have two rows of armed men across the road already ; I can see them from here . The town is in arms , as I said it was . I can only wallow in the exquisite comfort of my own exactitude . ”
51728	51752	51711	51717	Syme , whose eyes were the keenest	1423	“ It is quite true . There is a crowd or an army or some such thing across the end of that street . ”
51753	51760	51762	51762	Bull	134	“ Well , if there is , ”
51765	51822	51762	51762	Bull	134	“ it must be something else — a sham fight or the mayor ’s birthday or something . I can not and will not believe that plain , jolly people in a place like this walk about with dynamite in their pockets . Get on a bit , Syme , and let us look at them . ”
51849	51856	51857	51857	he	134	“ Why , you silly mugs ! ”
51860	51890	51857	51857	he	134	“ what did I tell you . That crowd ’s as law - abiding as a cow , and if it were n’t , it ’s on our side . ”
51891	51897	51899	51900	the professor	805	“ How do you know ? ”
51904	51909	51911	51911	Bull	134	“ You blind bat , ”
51913	51923	51911	51911	Bull	134	“ do n’t you see who is leading them ? ”
51943	51950	51930	51931	the Colonel	2828	“ Why , it ’s Renard ! ”
52017	52025	52027	52028	the Colonel	2828	“ What a fool I ’ve been ! ”
52030	52045	52027	52028	the Colonel	2828	“ Of course , the dear old boy has turned out to help us . ”
52082	52089	52066	52066	He	134	“ Dr. Renard ! Dr. Renard ! ”
52231	52234	52236	52238	the cigarette smoker	1435	“ Well , ”
52241	52248	52236	52238	the cigarette smoker	1435	“ what do you think now ? ”
52249	52253	52255	52256	Dr. Bull	134	“ I think , ”
52260	52408	52255	52256	Dr. Bull	134	“ that I am lying in bed at No . 217 Peabody Buildings , and that I shall soon wake up with a jump ; or , if that ’s not it , I think that I am sitting in a small cushioned cell in Hanwell , and that the doctor ca n’t make much of my case . But if you want to know what I do n’t think , I ’ll tell you . I do n’t think what you think . I do n’t think , and I never shall think , that the mass of ordinary men are a pack of dirty modern thinkers . No , sir , I ’m a democrat , and I still do n’t believe that Sunday could convert one average navvy or counter - jumper . No , I may be mad , but humanity is n’t . ”
52428	52436	52437	52437	he	85	“ You are a very fine fellow , ”
52440	52516	52437	52437	he	85	“ You can believe in a sanity which is not merely your sanity . And you ’re right enough about humanity , about peasants and people like that jolly old innkeeper . But you ’re not right about Renard . I suspected him from the first . He ’s rationalistic , and , what ’s worse , he ’s rich . When duty and religion are really destroyed , it will be by the rich . ”
52517	52524	52526	52530	the man with a cigarette	1436	“ They are really destroyed now , ”
52541	52548	52526	52530	the man with a cigarette	1436	“ The devils are coming on ! ”
52608	52611	52612	52612	he	2828	“ Gentlemen , ”
52615	52657	52612	52612	he	2828	“ the thing is incredible . It must be a practical joke . If you knew Renard as I do — it ’s like calling Queen Victoria a dynamiter . If you had got the man ’s character into your head — ”
52658	52662	52664	52664	Syme	85	“ Dr. Bull , ”
52667	52677	52664	52664	Syme	85	“ has at least got it into his hat . ”
52678	52687	52689	52690	the Colonel	2828	“ I tell you it ca n’t be ! ”
52694	52707	52709	52709	he	2828	“ Renard shall explain it . He shall explain it to me , ”
52713	52722	52724	52725	the smoker	1443	“ Do n’t be in such a hurry , ”
52727	52739	52724	52725	the smoker	1443	“ He will very soon explain it to all of us . ”
52787	52793	52795	52795	Syme	85	“ It is no good , ”
52797	52846	52795	52795	Syme	85	“ He will never get anything out of that old heathen . I vote we drive bang through the thick of them , bang as the bullets went through Bull ’s hat . We may all be killed , but we must kill a tidy number of them . ”
52847	52855	52857	52858	Dr. Bull	134	“ I wo n’t ‘ ave it , ”
52870	52886	52857	52858	Dr. Bull	134	“ The poor chaps may be making a mistake . Give the Colonel a chance . ”
52887	52895	52897	52898	the Professor	805	“ Shall we go back , then ? ”
52900	52903	52905	52905	Ratcliffe	163	“ No , ”
52911	52935	52905	52905	Ratcliffe	163	“ the street behind us is held too . In fact , I seem to see there another friend of yours , Syme . ”
53033	53040	53042	53043	the Professor	805	“ What the devil is up ? ”
53049	53056	53058	53058	Syme	85	“ The morning star has fallen ! ”
53125	53131	53133	53134	the Professor	805	“ The world is insane ! ”
53144	53147	53149	53150	Dr. Bull	134	“ No , ”
53155	53159	53149	53150	Dr. Bull	134	“ it is I. ”
53160	53168	53170	53171	the Professor	805	“ What are we going to do ? ”
53173	53178	53180	53180	Syme	85	“ At this moment , ”
53187	53199	53180	53180	Syme	85	“ I think we are going to smash into a lamppost . ”
53264	53271	53273	53274	the Professor	805	“ Well , we smashed something , ”
53281	53287	53273	53274	the Professor	805	“ That ’s some comfort . ”
53288	53295	53297	53297	Syme	85	“ You ’re becoming an anarchist , ”
53308	53312	53314	53314	Ratcliffe	163	“ Everyone is , ”
53419	53426	53428	53428	Syme	85	“ We have one more chance , ”
53438	53510	53428	53428	Syme	85	“ Whatever all this pandemonium means , I suppose the police station will help us . We ca n’t get there , for they hold the way . But there ’s a pier or breakwater runs out into the sea just here , which we could defend longer than anything else , like Horatius and his bridge . We must defend it till the Gendarmerie turn out . Keep after me . ”
53798	53802	53804	53804	Syme	85	“ The peasant ! ”
53806	53816	53804	53804	Syme	85	“ They have not risen since the Middle Ages . ”

Lo ! thy dread Empire , Chaos , is restored ; Light dies before thine uncreating word : Thy hand , great Anarch , lets the curtain fall ; And universal darkness buries all . ”

54090	54124	54126	54127	the Professor	805	” As he spoke there came a long crackle of musketry , and bullets seemed to hop like hailstones on the stones in front of them . ’ The gendarmes have joined them ! ”

54223	54276	54219	54219	he	163	“ No ; oddly enough I am not quite hopeless . There is one insane little hope that I can not get out of my mind . The power of this whole planet is against us , yet I can not help wondering whether this one silly little hope is hopeless yet . ”
54277	54286	54288	54288	Syme	85	“ In what or whom is your hope ? ”
54292	54300	54302	54303	the other	279	“ In a man I never saw , ”

54344	54347	54349	54350	the other	279	“ Perhaps , ”
54353	54371	54349	54350	the other	279	“ but if so , he was the only man whom Sunday found it hard to kill . ”
54372	54379	54381	54382	the Professor	805	“ I heard what you said , ”
54389	54403	54385	54385	his	805	“ I also am holding hard on to the thing I never saw . ”
54433	54446	54427	54431	a man waking from sleep	1511	“ Where is the Colonel ? I thought he was with us ! ”
54447	54453	54455	54455	Bull	134	“ The Colonel ! Yes , ”

54529	54536	54538	54538	Syme	85	“ No ! no ! no ! ”
54545	54557	54538	54538	Syme	85	“ not the Colonel too ! I will never believe it ! ”
54558	54565	54567	54568	the other	279	“ Will you believe your eyes ? ”
54700	54708	54710	54711	the Professor	805	“ Yes , he is gone too , ”
54720	54752	54710	54711	the Professor	805	“ Everything ’s gone . I ’m gone ! I ca n’t trust my own bodily machinery . I feel as if my own hand might fly up and strike me . ”
54753	54760	54762	54762	Syme	85	“ When my hand flies up , ”
54764	54771	54773	54773	he	85	“ it will strike somebody else , ”
54850	54855	54856	54856	he	85	“ Judas before Herod ! ”
54915	54922	54924	54924	Syme	85	“ Do you see this lantern ? ”
54930	55070	55071	55071	He	1532	“ Do you see the cross carved on it , and the flame inside ? You did not make it . You did not light it , Better men than you , men who could believe and obey , twisted the entrails of iron and preserved the legend of fire . There is not a street you walk on , there is not a thread you wear , that was not made as this lantern was , by denying your philosophy of dirt and rats . You can make nothing . You can only destroy . You will destroy mankind ; you will destroy the world . Let that suffice you . Yet this one old Christian lantern you shall not destroy . It shall go where your empire of apes will never have the wit to find it . ”
55112	55115	55117	55117	Syme	85	“ Swords ! ”
55130	55145	55117	55117	Syme	85	“ Let us charge these dogs , for our time has come to die . ”
55257	55263	55264	55264	he	701	“ There is some mistake , ”
55267	55289	55264	55264	he	701	“ Mr. Syme , I hardly think you understand your position . I arrest you in the name of the law . ”
55290	55295	55297	55297	Syme	85	“ Of the law ? ”
55304	55307	55309	55310	the Secretary	701	“ Certainly ! ”
55312	55321	55323	55323	he	701	“ I am a detective from Scotland Yard , ”
55333	55342	55344	55345	the Professor	805	“ And what do you suppose we are ? ”
55353	55356	55358	55359	the Secretary	701	“ You , ”
55362	55387	55358	55359	the Secretary	701	“ are , as I know for a fact , members of the Supreme Anarchist Council . Disguised as one of you , I — ”
55397	55406	55407	55407	he	134	“ There never was any Supreme Anarchist Council , ”
55410	55453	55454	55454	he	134	“ We were all a lot of silly policemen looking at each other . And all these nice people who have been peppering us with shot thought we were the dynamiters . I knew I could n’t be wrong about the mob , ”
55473	55503	55454	55454	he	134	“ Vulgar people are never mad . I ’m vulgar myself , and I know . I am now going on shore to stand a drink to everybody here . ”
55706	55726	55727	55727	he	163	“ I ca n’t make head or tail of old Sunday ’s little game any more than you can , ”
55730	55753	55727	55727	he	163	“ But whatever else Sunday is , he is n’t a blameless citizen . Damn it ! do you remember his face ? ”
55754	55759	55761	55761	Syme	85	“ I grant you , ”
55763	55774	55761	55761	Syme	85	“ that I have never been able to forget it . ”
55775	55778	55780	55781	the Secretary	701	“ Well , ”
55783	55806	55807	55807	he	701	“ I suppose we can find out soon , for to‑morrow we have our next general meeting . You will excuse me , ”
55816	55826	55807	55807	he	701	“ for being well acquainted with my secretarial duties . ”
55827	55834	55836	55837	the Professor	805	“ I suppose you are right , ”
55840	55869	55836	55837	the Professor	805	“ I suppose we might find it out from him ; but I confess that I should feel a bit afraid of asking Sunday who he really is . ”
55870	55873	55875	55876	the Secretary	701	“ Why , ”
55878	55884	55875	55876	the Secretary	701	“ for fear of bombs ? ”
55885	55888	55890	55891	the Professor	805	“ No , ”
55893	55901	55890	55891	the Professor	805	“ for fear he might tell me . ”
55902	55909	55911	55912	Dr. Bull	134	“ Let us have some drinks , ”
56104	56113	56115	56116	Dr. Bull	134	“ I tell you I ’ve seen him ! ”
56122	56125	56127	56127	Syme	85	“ Whom ? ”
56130	56135	56127	56127	Syme	85	“ Not the President ? ”
56136	56143	56145	56146	Dr. Bull	134	“ Not so bad as that , ”
56152	56165	56145	56146	Dr. Bull	134	“ not so bad as that . I ’ve got him here . ”
56166	56171	56173	56173	Syme	85	“ Got whom here ? ”
56176	56180	56182	56183	the other	279	“ Hairy man , ”
56186	56201	56182	56183	the other	279	“ man that used to be hairy man — Gogol . Here he is , ”
56245	56253	56254	56254	he	134	“ Why do you worry with me ? ”
56257	56266	56254	56254	he	134	“ You have expelled me as a spy . ”
56267	56273	56275	56275	Syme	85	“ We are all spies ! ”
56277	56283	56285	56286	Dr. Bull	134	“ We ’re all spies ! ”
56288	56295	56285	56286	Dr. Bull	134	“ Come and have a drink . ”
56313	56319	56321	56322	Dr. Bull	134	“ This is more cheerful , ”
56324	56338	56321	56322	Dr. Bull	134	“ we are six men going to ask one man what he means . ”
56339	56350	56352	56352	Syme	85	“ I think it is a bit queerer than that , ”
56354	56370	56352	56352	Syme	85	“ I think it is six men going to ask one man what they mean . ”
56511	56518	56520	56520	Syme	85	“ My reason is quite simple , ”
56522	56534	56520	56520	Syme	85	“ I attack him rashly because I am afraid of him . ”
56567	56570	56571	56571	he	1586	“ Delightful ! ”
56574	56594	56571	56571	he	1586	“ So pleased to see you all . What an exquisite day it is . Is the Czar dead ? ”
56612	56617	56618	56618	he	1588	“ No , sir , ”
56621	56638	56618	56618	he	1588	“ there has been no massacre . I bring you news of no such disgusting spectacles . ”
56639	56643	56645	56646	the President	2320	“ Disgusting spectacles ? ”
56655	56663	56645	56646	the President	2320	“ You mean Dr. Bull ’s spectacles ? ”
56683	56708	56672	56673	the President	2320	“ Of course , we all have our opinions and even our eyes , but really to call them disgusting before the man himself — ”
56722	56728	56729	56729	he	134	“ My spectacles are blackguardly , ”
56732	56743	56729	56729	he	134	“ but I ’m not . Look at my face . ”
56744	56759	56761	56762	the President	2320	“ I dare say it ’s the sort of face that grows on one , ”
56764	56800	56761	56762	the President	2320	“ in fact , it grows on you ; and who am I to quarrel with the wild fruits upon the Tree of Life ? I dare say it will grow on me some day . ”
56801	56809	56811	56812	the Secretary	701	“ We have no time for tomfoolery , ”
56818	56880	56811	56812	the Secretary	701	“ We have come to know what all this means . Who are you ? What are you ? Why did you get us all here ? Do you know who and what we are ? Are you a half‑witted man playing the conspirator , or are you a clever man playing the fool ? Answer me , I tell you . ”
56881	56884	56886	56886	Sunday	107	“ Candidates , ”
56888	56984	56886	56886	Sunday	107	“ are only required to answer eight out of the seventeen questions on the paper . As far as I can make out , you want me to tell you what I am , and what you are , and what this table is , and what this Council is , and what this world is for all I know . Well , I will go so far as to rend the veil of one mystery . If you want to know what you are , you are a set of highly well‑intentioned young jackasses . ”
56985	56989	56991	56991	Syme	85	“ And you , ”
56996	57001	56991	56991	Syme	85	“ what are you ? ”
57002	57009	57011	57012	the President	2320	“ I ? What am I ? ”
57035	57213	57015	57015	he	2320	“ You want to know what I am , do you ? Bull , you are a man of science . Grub in the roots of those trees and find out the truth about them . Syme , you are a poet . Stare at those morning clouds . But I tell you this , that you will have found out the truth of the last tree and the top - most cloud before the truth about me . You will understand the sea , and I shall be still a riddle ; you shall know what the stars are , and not know what I am . Since the beginning of the world all men have hunted me like a wolf — kings and sages , and poets and lawgivers , all the churches , and all the philosophies . But I have never been caught yet , and the skies will fall in the time I turn to bay . I have given them a good run for their money , and I will now . ”
57268	57298	57242	57242	he	1597	“ There ’s one thing I ’ll tell you though about who I am . I am the man in the dark room , who made you all policemen . ”
57485	57489	57476	57476	he	85	“ Stop thief ! ”
57818	57825	57792	57793	Dr. Bull	134	“ What about Martin Tupper now ? ”
57826	57834	57836	57836	Bull	134	“ What does the old maniac mean ? ”
57843	57851	57792	57793	Dr. Bull	134	“ What does yours say , Syme ? ”
57869	57920	57921	57922	The President	2320	“ No one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by the Archdeacon more than I. I trust it will not come to that . But , for the last time , where are your goloshes ? The thing is too bad , especially after what uncle said . ”
58050	58054	58056	58056	Syme	85	“ After him ! ”
58058	58073	58056	58056	Syme	85	“ He ca n’t go astray now . There ’s no mistaking a fire‑engine . ”
58154	58170	58146	58146	he	1649	“ Fly at once . The truth about your trouser - stretchers is known.—A FRIEND . ”
58326	58333	58334	58334	he	85	“ What place can this be ? ”
58337	58358	58334	58334	he	85	“ Can it be the old devil ’s house ? I ’ve heard he has a house in North London . ”
58359	58364	58366	58367	the Secretary	701	“ All the better , ”
58377	58385	58366	58367	the Secretary	701	“ we shall find him at home . ”
58386	58395	58397	58397	Syme	85	“ No , but it is n’t that , ”
58403	58422	58397	58397	Syme	85	“ I hear the most horrible noises , like devils laughing and sneezing and blowing their devilish noses ! ”
58423	58431	58433	58434	the Secretary	701	“ His dogs barking , of course , ”
58436	58444	58446	58446	Syme	85	“ Why not say his black‑beetles barking ! ”
58449	58466	58446	58446	Syme	85	“ snails barking ! geraniums barking ! Did you ever hear a dog bark like that ? ”
58511	58522	58524	58524	Gogol	124	“ The dogs of Sunday would be no ordinary dogs , ”
58545	58552	58553	58553	he	85	“ Well , listen to that , ”
58556	58566	58553	58553	he	85	“ is that a dog — anybody ’s dog ? ”
58602	58612	58614	58615	the Secretary	701	“ Well , his house ought to be hell ! ”
58617	58629	58614	58615	the Secretary	701	“ and if it is hell , I ’m going in ! ”
58678	58684	58685	58685	he	134	“ Why , you asses , ”
58688	58694	58685	58685	he	134	“ it ’s the Zoo ! ”
58725	58732	58734	58735	the keeper	1666	“ Has it come this way ? ”
58737	58741	58743	58743	Syme	85	“ Has what ? ”
58745	58749	58751	58752	the keeper	1666	“ The elephant ! ”
58754	58764	58751	58752	the keeper	1666	“ An elephant has gone mad and run away ! ”
58765	58775	58777	58779	the other stranger	1668	“ He has run away with an old gentleman , ”
58782	58791	58777	58779	the other stranger	1668	“ a poor old gentleman with white hair ! ”
58792	58799	58801	58801	Syme	85	“ What sort of old gentleman ? ”
58807	58820	58822	58823	the keeper	1666	“ A very large and fat old gentleman in light grey clothes , ”
58826	58829	58831	58831	Syme	85	“ Well , ”
58833	58918	58831	58831	Syme	85	“ if he ’s that particular kind of old gentleman , if you ’re quite sure that he ’s a large and fat old gentleman in grey clothes , you may take my word for it that the elephant has not run away with him . He has run away with the elephant . The elephant is not made by God that could run away with him if he did not consent to the elopement . And , by thunder , there he is ! ”
59019	59023	59025	59026	the populace	1676	“ Stop him ! ”
59028	59037	59025	59026	the populace	1676	“ He ’ll be out of the gate ! ”
59038	59043	59045	59046	the keeper	1666	“ Stop a landslide ! ”
59048	59056	59045	59046	the keeper	1666	“ He is out of the gate ! ”
59102	59106	59108	59108	Bull	134	“ Great Lord ! ”
59110	59137	59108	59108	Bull	134	“ I never knew an elephant could go so fast . Well , it must be hansom‑cabs again if we are to keep him in sight . ”
59490	59503	59504	59509	The man once known as Gogol	1689	“ The word , I fancy , should be ‘ pink ’ . ”
59760	59767	59769	59769	Syme	85	“ Where has he gone to ? ”
59776	59785	59787	59788	an official	1705	“ Gentleman rushed into the Exhibition , sir ! ”
59802	59820	59795	59795	he	1705	“ Funny gentleman , sir . Asked me to hold his horse , and gave me this . ”
59834	59844	59821	59821	He	1705	“ To the Secretary of the Central Anarchist Council . ”
59861	59889	59845	59846	The Secretary	701	“ When the herring runs a mile , Let the Secretary smile ; When the herring tries to fly , Let the Secretary die . Rustic Proverb . ”
59890	59896	59898	59899	the Secretary	701	“ Why the eternal crikey , ”
59901	59923	59898	59899	the Secretary	701	“ did you let the man in ? Do people commonly come to you Exhibition riding on mad elephants ? Do — ”
59924	59927	59929	59929	Syme	85	“ Look ! ”
59932	59938	59929	59929	Syme	85	“ Look over there ! ’ “
59943	59949	59980	59981	the Secretary	701	” asked the Secretary savagely . “
59956	59966	59980	59981	the Secretary	701	” said Syme , and pointed in a frenzy . “
59983	59993	59980	59981	the Secretary	701	“ What is there queer about a captive balloon ? ”
59994	59997	59999	59999	Syme	85	“ Nothing , ”
60001	60065	59999	59999	Syme	85	“ except that it is n’t captive ! ’ They all turned their eyes to where the balloon swung and swelled above the Exhibition on a string , like a child ’s balloon . A second afterwards the string came in two just under the car , and the balloon , broken loose , floated away with the freedom of a soap bubble . “
60070	60075	59999	59999	Syme	85	” shrieked the Secretary . “
60082	60128	60076	60076	He	1709	” and he shook his fists at the sky . The balloon , borne by some chance wind , came right above them , and they could see the great white head of the President peering over the side and looking benevolently down on them . “
60134	60155	60076	60076	He	1709	” said the Professor with the elderly manner that he could never disconnect from his bleached beard and parchment face . “
60175	60214	60161	60161	I	0	” He put up a trembling hand and took from that shelf a piece of twisted paper , which he opened absently only to find it inscribed with a true lover ’s knot and , the words : — “
60225	60241	60242	60242	I	0	” There was a short silence , and then Syme said , biting his beard — “
60261	60471	60242	60242	I	0	” ACROSS green fields , and breaking through blooming hedges , toiled six draggled detectives , about five miles out of London . The optimist of the party had at first proposed that they should follow the balloon across South England in hansom‑cabs . But he was ultimately convinced of the persistent refusal of the balloon to follow the roads , and the still more persistent refusal of the cabmen to follow the balloon . Consequently the tireless though exasperated travellers broke through black thickets and ploughed through ploughed fields till each was turned into a figure too outrageous to be mistaken for a tramp . Those green hills of Surrey saw the final collapse and tragedy of the admirable light grey suit in which Syme had set out from Saffron Park . His silk hat was broken over his nose by a swinging bough , his coat‑tails were torn to the shoulder by arresting thorns , the clay of England was splashed up to his collar ; but he still carried his yellow beard forward with a silent and furious determination , and his eyes were still fixed on that floating ball of gas , which in the full flush of sunset seemed coloured like a sunset cloud . “
60475	60479	60242	60242	I	0	” he said , “
60485	60486	60242	60242	I	0	” “
60494	60499	60500	60500	I	0	” said the Professor . “

60512	60517	60500	60500	I	0	” said Dr. Bull , “
60531	60532	60527	60529	the old boy	1711	” “
60536	60542	60527	60529	the old boy	1711	” said the vindictive Professor , “
60565	60566	60562	60563	Little Snowdrop	176	” “
60576	60581	60567	60567	I	0	” said Dr. Bull . “
60584	60590	60592	60592	you	0	” cried the Secretary bitterly . “

60658	60663	60646	60647	old Sunday	107	” said Syme impatiently , “
60666	60667	60646	60647	old Sunday	107	” “
60680	60686	60671	60671	he	1711	” said Dr. Bull desperately . “
60790	60791	60792	60792	You	0	” “
60796	60801	60802	60802	I	0	” said the Secretary . “
60808	60812	60802	60802	I	0	” cried Bull , “

60896	60903	60893	60893	Our	1718	” said Syme , looking upwards , “
60913	60914	60893	60893	Our	1718	” “
60918	60922	60893	60893	Our	1718	” concluded Bull , “
61062	61081	61056	61056	he	107	” There was a long silence , and then the Secretary said in a curious , strained voice — “
61439	61440	61442	61442	you	1736	” “
61448	61458	61442	61442	you	1736	” cut in the clear voice of Inspector Ratcliffe . “
61718	61719	61703	61703	you	1736	” “
61730	61734	61728	61728	Gogol	124	” asked Syme . “
61744	61749	61735	61735	I	0	” said Gogol simply , “
61761	61762	61753	61753	I	0	” “
61772	61777	61780	61780	you	1756	” said Syme thoughtfully . “
61785	61805	61780	61780	you	1756	” The Professor was walking with bent head and trailing stick , and he did not answer at all . “
61811	61816	61809	61809	Professor	884	” said Syme genially . “
61825	61834	61835	61835	I	0	” The Professor spoke at last very slowly . “
61839	61843	61835	61835	I	0	” he said , “
61980	61997	61962	61962	one	225	” He paused for a little , still trailing his stick , and then went on — “
62232	62261	62263	62263	you	134	” Syme ’s eyes were still fixed upon the errant orb , which , reddened in the evening light , looked like some rosier and more innocent world . “
62269	62273	62263	62263	you	134	” he said , “
62390	62391	62381	62381	Sunday	107	” “
62400	62404	62381	62381	Sunday	107	” said Bull ; “
62410	62411	62381	62381	Sunday	107	” “
62418	62423	62424	62424	I	0	” said Syme slowly , “
62508	62509	62504	62504	men	214	” “
62513	62518	62504	62504	men	214	” said Dr. Bull . “
62606	62607	62608	62608	Syme	85	” “
62610	62615	62608	62608	Syme	85	” exclaimed the Secretary , “
62620	62621	62608	62608	Syme	85	” “
62702	62703	62704	62704	Pan	177	” “
62706	62712	62714	62715	a god	1790	” said the Professor dreamily , “
62720	62721	62704	62704	Pan	177	” “
62729	62740	62704	62704	Pan	177	” went on Syme like a man talking to himself , “
62855	62856	62839	62839	I	0	” “
62864	62868	62858	62858	you	0	” asked Ratcliffe . “
62871	62875	62858	62858	you	0	” replied Syme , “
62935	62936	62932	62932	he	107	” “
62939	62947	62932	62932	he	107	” said Dr. Bull , and shuddered . “
62954	62958	62932	62932	he	107	” said Syme . “
63007	63008	62995	62995	he	107	” “
63015	63027	62995	62995	he	107	” said the Secretary , and frowned at his broken boots . “
63032	63039	63030	63030	me	0	” cried Syme with extraordinary emphasis . “
63123	63124	63115	63115	we	1800	” “
63127	63133	63115	63115	we	1800	” cried out Bull clamorously , “
63140	63212	63115	63115	we	1800	” There was no need to cry out to Syme , who had never taken his eyes off it . He saw the great luminous globe suddenly stagger in the sky , right itself , and then sink slowly behind the trees like a setting sun . The man called Gogol , who had hardly spoken through all their weary travels , suddenly threw up his hands like a lost spirit . “
63217	63221	63213	63213	He	1802	” he cried . “
63237	63238	63226	63226	he	1802	” “
63241	63246	63247	63247	You	1798	” snorted the Secretary . “
63284	63285	63268	63268	him	1802	” “
63290	63295	63268	63268	him	1802	” said the Professor . “
63305	63306	63307	63307	Pan	177	” “
63310	63316	63307	63307	Pan	177	” said Dr. Bull irritably . “
63325	63326	63321	63321	Pan	177	” “
63331	63336	63328	63328	he	1802	” said the Professor , “
63344	63345	63340	63340	He	1802	” “
63350	63358	63340	63340	He	1802	” said the Secretary , looking down , “
63365	63376	63360	63360	he	1802	” Syme had stood without hearing any of the exclamations . “
63382	63387	63340	63340	He	1802	” he said shortly . “
63393	63402	63340	63340	He	1802	” Then he added with an indescribable gesture — “
63424	63589	63421	63421	his	1802	” He strode off towards the distant trees with a new energy , his rags and ribbons fluttering in the wind . The others followed him in a more footsore and dubious manner . And almost at the same moment all six men realised that they were not alone in the little field . Across the square of turf a tall man was advancing towards them , leaning on a strange long staff like a sceptre . He was clad in a fine but old‑fashioned suit with knee‑breeches ; its colour was that shade between blue , violet and grey which can be seen in certain shadows of the woodland . His hair was whitish grey , and at the first glance , taken along with his knee - breeches , looked as if it was powdered . His advance was very quiet ; but for the silver frost upon his head , he might have been one to the shadows of the wood . “
63592	63596	63597	63598	my master	1810	” he said , “
63611	63612	63597	63598	my master	1810	” “
63618	63626	63627	63627	I	0	” asked Syme , standing quite still . “
63635	63652	63630	63630	you	733	” said the man respectfully . There was a silence , and then the Secretary said — “
63658	63659	63660	63660	It	1814	” “
63669	63674	63660	63660	It	1814	” said the stranger . “
63683	63771	63675	63676	My master	1810	” Syme looked left and right upon the patch of green field in which he found himself . The hedges were ordinary hedges , the trees seemed ordinary trees ; yet he felt like a man entrapped in fairyland . He looked the mysterious ambassador up and down , but he could discover nothing except that the man ’s coat was the exact colour of the purple shadows , and that the man ’s face was the exact colour of the red and brown and golden sky . “
63777	63964	63675	63676	My master	1810	” Syme said briefly , and without a word the man in the violet coat turned his back and walked towards a gap in the hedge , which let in suddenly the light of a white road . As the six wanderers broke out upon this thoroughfare , they saw the white road blocked by what looked like a long row of carriages , such a row of carriages as might close the approach to some house in Park Lane . Along the side of these carriages stood a rank of splendid servants , all dressed in the grey‑blue uniform , and all having a certain quality of stateliness and freedom which would not commonly belong to the servants of a gentleman , but rather to the officials and ambassadors of a great king . There were no less than six carriages waiting , one for each of the tattered and miserable band . All the attendants ( as if in court‑dress ) wore swords , and as each man crawled into his carriage they drew them , and saluted with a sudden blaze of steel . “
63971	63980	63675	63676	My master	1810	” asked Bull of Syme as they separated . “
63989	63990	63991	63991	I	0	” “
63996	64011	63991	63991	I	0	” said Syme as he sank wearily back in the cushions of his carriage ; “
64033	64483	63991	63991	I	0	” The six adventurers had passed through many adventures , but not one had carried them so utterly off their feet as this last adventure of comfort . They had all become inured to things going roughly ; but things suddenly going smoothly swamped them . They could not even feebly imagine what the carriages were ; it was enough for them to know that they were carriages , and carriages with cushions . They could not conceive who the old man was who had led them ; but it was quite enough that he had certainly led them to the carriages . Syme drove through a drifting darkness of trees in utter abandonment . It was typical of him that while he had carried his bearded chin forward fiercely so long as anything could be done , when the whole business was taken out of his hands he fell back on the cushions in a frank collapse . Very gradually and very vaguely he realised into what rich roads the carriage was carrying him . He saw that they passed the stone gates of what might have been a park , that they began gradually to climb a hill which , while wooded on both sides , was somewhat more orderly than a forest . Then there began to grow upon him , as upon a man slowly waking from a healthy sleep , a pleasure in everything . He felt that the hedges were what hedges should be , living walls ; that a hedge is like a human army , disciplined , but all the more alive . He saw high elms behind the hedges , and vaguely thought how happy boys would be climbing there . Then his carriage took a turn of the path , and he saw suddenly and quietly , like a long , low , sunset cloud , a long , low house , mellow in the mild light of sunset . All the six friends compared notes afterwards and quarrelled ; but they all agreed that in some unaccountable way the place reminded them of their boyhood . It was either this elm‑top or that crooked path , it was either this scrap of orchard or that shape of a window ; but each man of them declared that he could remember this place before he could remember his mother . When the carriages eventually rolled up to a large , low , cavernous gateway , another man in the same uniform , but wearing a silver star on the grey breast of his coat , came out to meet them . This impressive person said to the bewildered Syme — “
64493	64654	64655	64655	I	0	” Syme , under the influence of the same mesmeric sleep of amazement , went up the large oaken stairs after the respectful attendant . He entered a splendid suite of apartments that seemed to be designed specially for him . He walked up to a long mirror with the ordinary instinct of his class , to pull his tie straight or to smooth his hair ; and there he saw the frightful figure that he was — blood running down his face from where the bough had struck him , his hair standing out like yellow rags of rank grass , his clothes torn into long , wavering tatters . At once the whole enigma sprang up , simply as the question of how he had got there , and how he was to get out again . Exactly at the same moment a man in blue , who had been appointed as his valet , said very solemnly — “
64664	64665	64655	64655	I	0	” “
64668	64673	64674	64674	I	0	” said Syme sardonically . “
64681	64708	64709	64710	My master	1810	” and he lifted two long strips of his frock‑coat in fascinating festoons , and made a movement as if to twirl like a ballet girl . “
64716	64777	64709	64710	My master	1810	” said the attendant , that there is a fancy dress ball to‑night , and that he desires you to put on the costume that I have laid out . Meanwhile , sir , there is a bottle of Burgundy and some cold pheasant , which he hopes you will not refuse , as it is some hours before supper . ”
64778	64786	64788	64788	Syme	85	“ Cold pheasant is a good thing , ”
64791	64840	64841	64842	The servant	1823	“ and Burgundy is a spanking good thing . But really I do not want either of them so much as I want to know what the devil all this means , and what sort of costume you have got laid out for me . Where is it ? ”
64887	64898	64900	64901	the valet	1824	“ You ’re to be dressed as Thursday , sir , ”
64905	64910	64912	64912	Syme	85	“ Dressed as Thursday ! ”
64916	64925	64912	64912	Syme	85	“ It does n’t sound a warm costume . ”
64926	64933	64935	64937	the other eagerly	1825	“ Oh , yes , sir , ”
64939	64956	64935	64937	the other eagerly	1825	“ the Thursday costume is quite warm , sir . It fastens up to the chin . ”
64957	64966	64968	64968	Syme	85	“ Well , I do n’t understand anything , ”
64972	65039	64968	64968	Syme	85	“ I have been used so long to uncomfortable adventures that comfortable adventures knock me out . Still , I may be allowed to ask why I should be particularly like Thursday in a green frock spotted all over with the sun and moon . Those orbs , I think , shine on other days . I once saw the moon on Tuesday , I remember . ”
65040	65046	65048	65049	the valet	1824	“ Beg pardon , sir , ”
65051	65058	65048	65049	the valet	1824	“ Bible also provided for you , ”
65116	65124	65126	65126	Syme	85	“ This is getting wilder and wilder , ”
65136	65159	65126	65126	Syme	85	“ Who are these people who provide cold pheasant and Burgundy , and green clothes and Bibles ? Do they provide everything ? ”
65160	65167	65169	65170	the attendant	3468	“ Yes , sir , everything , ”
65173	65183	65169	65170	the attendant	3468	“ Shall I help you on with your costume ? ”
65184	65193	65195	65195	Syme	85	“ Oh , hitch the bally thing on ! ”
66251	66266	66248	66248	his	701	“ We do not know yet that he is not dead in a field . ”
66705	66713	66714	66714	he	107	“ We will eat and drink later , ”
66717	66876	66714	66714	he	107	“ Let us remain together a little , we who have loved each other so sadly , and have fought so long . I seem to remember only centuries of heroic war , in which you were always heroes — epic on epic , iliad on iliad , and you always brothers in arms . Whether it was but recently ( for time is nothing ) , or at the beginning of the world , I sent you out to war . I sat in the darkness , where there is not any created thing , and to you I was only a voice commanding valour and an unnatural virtue . You heard the voice in the dark , and you never heard it again . The sun in heaven denied it , the earth and sky denied it , all human wisdom denied it . And when I met you in the daylight I denied it myself . ”
66896	66962	66982	66982	his	1900	“ But you were men . You did not forget your secret honour , though the whole cosmos turned an engine of torture to tear it out of you . I knew how near you were to hell . I know how you , Thursday , crossed swords with King Satan , and how you , Wednesday , named me in the hour without hope . ”
66994	67001	66982	66982	his	1900	“ Who and what are you ? ”
67002	67008	67010	67011	the other	279	“ I am the Sabbath , ”
67015	67023	67010	67011	the other	279	“ I am the peace of God . ”
67039	67046	67047	67047	he	701	“ I know what you mean , ”
67050	67177	67047	67047	he	701	“ and it is exactly that that I can not forgive you . I know you are contentment , optimism , what do they call the thing , an ultimate reconciliation . Well , I am not reconciled . If you were the man in the dark room , why were you also Sunday , an offense to the sunlight ? If you were from the first our father and our friend , why were you also our greatest enemy ? We wept , we fled in terror ; the iron entered into our souls — and you are the peace of God ! Oh , I can forgive God His anger , though it destroyed nations ; but I can not forgive Him His peace . ”
67201	67204	67206	67206	Syme	85	“ No , ”
67208	67277	67206	67206	Syme	85	“ I do not feel fierce like that . I am grateful to you , not only for wine and hospitality here , but for many a fine scamper and free fight . But I should like to know . My soul and heart are as happy and quiet here as this old garden , but my reason is still crying out . I should like to know . ”
67288	67305	67281	67281	Ratcliffe	163	“ It seems so silly that you should have been on both sides and fought yourself . ”
67309	67328	67306	67306	Bull	85	“ l understand nothing , but I am happy . In fact , I am going to sleep . ”
67329	67335	67337	67338	the Professor	805	“ I am not happy , ”
67346	67364	67337	67338	the Professor	805	“ because I do not understand . You let me stray a little too near to hell . ”
67378	67390	67367	67367	Gogol	124	“ I wish I knew why I was hurt so much . ”
67419	67446	67416	67416	he	107	“ I have heard your complaints in order . And here , I think , comes another to complain , and we will hear him also . ”
67599	67602	67604	67604	Syme	85	“ Gregory ! ”
67611	67620	67604	67604	Syme	85	“ Why , this is the real anarchist ! ”
67621	67624	67626	67626	Gregory	106	“ Yes , ”
67635	67642	67626	67626	Gregory	106	“ I am the real anarchist . ”
67643	67652	67654	67654	Bull	85	“ ‘ Now there was a day , ’ ”
67664	67687	67654	67654	Bull	85	” ‘ when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them . ’ ”
67688	67693	67695	67695	Gregory	106	“ You are right , ”
67702	67717	67695	67695	Gregory	106	“ I am a destroyer . I would destroy the world if I could . ”
67740	67747	67748	67748	he	85	“ Oh , most unhappy man , ”
67751	67765	67748	67748	he	85	“ try to be happy ! You have red hair like your sister . ”
67766	67781	67783	67783	Gregory	106	“ My red hair , like red flames , shall burn up the world , ”
67785	67815	67783	67783	Gregory	106	“ I thought I hated everything more than common men can hate anything ; but I find that I do not hate everything so much as I hate you ! ”
67816	67822	67824	67824	Syme	85	“ I never hated you , ”
67839	67842	67843	67843	he	85	“ You ! ”
67846	68070	67843	67843	he	85	“ You never hated because you never lived . I know what you are all of you , from first to last — you are the people in power ! You are the police — the great fat , smiling men in blue and buttons ! You are the Law , and you have never been broken . But is there a free soul alive that does not long to break you , only because you have never been broken ? We in revolt talk all kind of nonsense doubtless about this crime or that crime of the Government . It is all folly ! The only crime of the Government is that it governs . The unpardonable sin of the supreme power is that it is supreme . I do not curse you for being cruel . I do not curse you ( though I might ) for being kind . I curse you for being safe ! You sit in your chairs of stone , and have never come down from them . You are the seven angels of heaven , and you have had no troubles . Oh , I could forgive you everything , you that rule all mankind , if I could feel for once that you had suffered for one hour a real agony such as I — ”
68083	68088	68089	68089	he	85	“ I see everything , ”
68092	68266	68089	68089	he	85	“ everything that there is . Why does each thing on the earth war against each other thing ? Why does each small thing in the world have to fight against the world itself ? Why does a fly have to fight the whole universe ? Why does a dandelion have to fight the whole universe ? For the same reason that I had to be alone in the dreadful Council of the Days . So that each thing that obeys law may have the glory and isolation of the anarchist . So that each man fighting for order may be as brave and good a man as the dynamiter . So that the real lie of Satan may be flung back in the face of this blasphemer , so that by tears and torture we may earn the right to say to this man , ‘ You lie ! ’ No agonies can be too great to buy the right to say to this accuser , ‘ We also have suffered . ’ “
68358	68380	68382	68382	you	1916	” He had turned his eyes so as to see suddenly the great face of Sunday , which wore a strange smile.­ “
68384	68392	68382	68382	you	1916	” he cried in a dreadful voice , “
68398	68473	68382	68382	you	1916	” As he gazed , the great face grew to an awful size , grew larger than the colossal mask of Memnon , which had made him scream as a child . It grew larger and larger , filling the whole sky ; then everything went black . Only in the blackness before it entirely destroyed his brain he seemed to hear a distant voice saying a commonplace text that he had heard somewhere , “
