107	115	117	117	he	109	" Is it so bad as that ? "
429	432	434	437	the lady in Italian	240	" Sir , "
439	445	434	437	the lady in Italian	240	" I need a postillion . "
598	605	606	606	she	240	" I must have a postillion , "
609	614	616	617	the landlord	218	" Presently , madam , "
630	641	642	642	He	218	" In a minute . In less than a minute . "
742	776	778	778	she	219	" The postillion who drove me from Florence was drunk — oh , but drunk ! He rolled off his horse just here , opposite the door . See , I beat him , "
790	821	778	778	she	219	" But it was no use . I broke my cane over his back , but he would not get up . He crawled into the passage where he lies . "
852	862	863	863	she	219	" And I must reach Bologna to - day , "
870	878	863	863	she	219	" It is of the last importance . "
879	889	891	891	Wogan	109	" Fortune is kind to us both , madam , "
897	925	891	891	Wogan	109	" My horse is lamed , as you see . I will be your charioteer , for I too am in a desperate hurry to reach Bologna . "
932	935	936	936	she	219	" Oh ! "
951	954	956	956	he	109	" Ah ! "
989	994	995	995	she	219	" You are English ? "
1069	1071	1082	1082	her	219	" No "
1092	1117	1119	1119	he	109	" I beg your pardon . Yes , I will drive you to Bologna if the landlord will swear to look after my horse . "
1175	1182	1184	1185	the lady	219	" The horse is a favourite ? "
1187	1190	1192	1192	Wogan	109	" Madam , "
1198	1226	1192	1192	Wogan	109	" I would not lose that horse for all the world , for the woman I shall marry will ride on it into my city of dreams . "
1245	1250	1251	1251	she	219	" Is he sober ? "
1257	1260	1262	1263	the landlord	218	" Madam , "
1267	1278	1262	1263	the landlord	218	" in this district he is nicknamed the water drinker . "
1279	1290	1262	1263	the landlord	218	" You know him , then ? He is Italian ? "
1291	1301	1302	1303	The landlord	218	" He is more . He is of Tuscany . "
1729	1732	1734	1735	the courtier	299	" You ? "
1737	1740	1734	1735	the courtier	299	" Already ? "
1770	1784	1762	1762	he	109	" Then nothing has happened , Whittington ? There is no bad news ? "
1785	1817	1819	1819	Whittington	111	" There is news so bad , my friend , that you might have jogged here on a mule and still have lost no time . Your hurry is clean wasted , "
1942	1945	1947	1947	she	219	" Harry , "
1976	1995	1996	1996	he	109	" But I 'm glad you 've come . I did not look for you for another week , "
2016	2022	2023	2023	she	219	" This is your lodging ? "
2026	2029	2031	2031	he	109	" No , "
2033	2038	2031	2031	he	109	" the King 's ; "
2063	2070	2055	2055	her	308	" Then who was he,—my postillion ? "
2071	2075	2077	2077	Whittington	111	" Your postillion ? "
2088	2123	2077	2077	Whittington	111	" Yes , the tall man who looked as if he should have been a scholar and had twisted himself all awry into a soldier . You must have passed him in the hall . "
2137	2150	2152	2152	he	111	" Your postillion , was he ? That 's the oddest thing , "
2157	2202	2152	2152	he	111	" Your postillion was Mr. Charles Wogan , who comes from Rome post - haste with the Pope 's procuration for the marriage . You have helped him on his way , it seems . Here 's a good beginning , to be sure . "
2256	2264	2266	2266	Whittington	111	" But you need not blame yourself , "
2279	2294	2269	2269	he	111	" All the procurations in Christendom will not marry James Stuart to Clementina Sobieski . "
2295	2303	2271	2271	his	111	" She has not come , then ? "
2304	2338	2339	2340	The lady	219	" No , nor will she come . There is news to - day . Lean back from the window , and I will tell you . She has been arrested at Innspruck . "
2349	2352	2354	2354	Whittington	111	" Hush , "
2368	2393	2357	2357	he	111	" I have hired a house for your Ladyship , which I trust will be found convenient . My servant will drive you thither . "
2916	2944	2914	2932	Clementina 's qualifications,—"Daughter of the King of Poland , cousin to the Emperor and to the King of Portugal	3100	qualifications,—"Daughter of the King of Poland , cousin to the Emperor and to the King of Portugal , niece to the Electors of Treves , Bavaria , and Palatine,"—the
3188	3224	3237	3237	his	109	" Well , we will hear the story . Well , you left Ohlau with the Princess and her mother and a mile - long train of servants in spite of my commands of secrecy . "
3262	3265	3267	3267	Hay	115	" Sir , "
3269	3280	3267	3267	Hay	115	" the Princess 's mother would not abate a man . "
3281	3291	3237	3237	his	109	" Well , you reached Ratisbon . And there ? "
3292	3322	3358	3358	He	115	" There the English minister came forward from the town to flout us with an address of welcome in which he used not our incognitos but our true names . "
3323	3344	3358	3358	He	115	" From Ratisbon then no doubt you hurried ? Since you were discovered , you shed your retinue and hurried ? "
3345	3354	3356	3356	Hay	115	" Sir , we hurried — to Augsburg , "
3371	3379	3368	3368	he	115	" At Augsburg we stayed eight days . "
3380	3384	3368	3368	he	115	" Eight days ? "
3440	3448	3429	3429	Clementina	116	" And why eight days in Augsburg ? "
3449	3467	3469	3469	Hay	115	" The Princess 's mother would have her jewels reset . Augsburg is famous for its jewellers , "
3491	3496	3497	3497	he	348	" Her jewels reset ! "
3507	3512	3500	3500	He	348	" Her jewels reset ! "
3521	3559	3514	3514	he	348	" I lose a wife , gentlemen , and very likely a kingdom too , so that a lady may have her jewels reset at Augsburg , where , to be sure , there are famous jewellers . "
3589	3687	3577	3577	He	348	" And those eight days gave just the time for a courier from the Emperor at Vienna to pass you on the road and not press his horse . One should be glad of that . It would have been a pity had the courier killed his horse . Oh , I can fashion the rest of the story for myself . You trailed on to Innspruck , where the Governor marched out with a troop and herded you in . They let you go , however . No doubt they bade you hurry back to me . "
3688	3695	3697	3697	Hay	115	" Sir , I did hurry , "
3707	3714	3697	3697	Hay	115	" I travelled hither without rest . "
3738	3746	3748	3748	he	115	" Yes , you would do that , "
3750	3790	3748	3748	he	115	" That would be the time for you to hurry with a pigeon 's swiftness so that your King might taste his bitter news not a minute later than need be . And what said she upon her arrest ? "
3791	3797	3799	3799	Hay	115	" The Princess 's mother ? "
3808	3822	3805	3805	he	115	" No . Her Highness , the Princess Clementina . What said she ? "
3823	3876	3882	3882	her	354	" Sir , she covered her face with her hands for perhaps the space of a minute . Then she leaned forward to the Governor , who stood by her carriage , and cried , ' Shut four walls about me quick ! I could sink into the earth for shame . ' "
3921	3940	3901	3901	He	109	" She would have tramped here barefoot had she had one guide with a spirit to match hers . "
4090	4098	4099	4099	he	109	" You can keep a silent tongue , "
4105	4112	4099	4099	he	109	" There 's profit in it ; "
4122	4132	4114	4114	Wogan	109	" You have not seen me if any ask . "
4133	4136	4138	4139	the man	365	" Sir , "
4141	4149	4138	4139	the man	365	" any bright object disturbs my vision . "
4150	4159	4161	4161	Wogan	109	" You can see a crown , though , "
4163	4178	4161	4161	Wogan	109	" Through a breeches pocket . But if I held it in my hand — "
4179	4185	4138	4139	the man	365	" It would dazzle you . "
4186	4198	4161	4161	Wogan	109	" So much that I should be blind to the giver . "
4651	4654	4655	4655	he	109	" Marnier , "
4672	4723	4655	4655	he	109	" take this to Mr. Edgar , the King 's secretary , as soon as it grows dusk . Have a care that no one sees you deliver it . Lock the parlour door when you go , and take the key . I am not yet back from Rome . "
4806	4811	4813	4813	Wogan	109	" At what hour ? "
4815	4830	4813	4813	Wogan	109	" Ten o'clock , monsieur , at the little postern in the garden wall . "
4831	4837	4842	4842	Wogan	109	" And the time now ? "
4838	4841	4813	4813	Wogan	109	" Nine . "
5166	5229	5154	5154	he	348	" You have outsped your time by two days , Mr. Wogan . That is unwise , since it may lead us to expect again the impossible of you . But here , alas , your speed for once brings us no profit . You have heard , no doubt . Her Highness the Princess Clementina is held at Innspruck in prison . "
5236	5241	5242	5242	he	109	" Prisons , sir , "
5246	5264	5242	5242	he	109	" have been broken before to - day . I myself was once put to that necessity . "
5285	5293	5294	5294	he	348	" An army could not rescue her , "
5297	5305	5294	5294	he	348	" No , but one man might . "
5306	5309	5310	5310	he	348	" You ? "
5331	5336	5313	5313	He	348	" It is impossible ! "
5337	5349	5350	5351	The Chevalier	114	" Then I beg your Majesty to expect the impossible again . "
5528	5535	5520	5520	his	348	" What does your Eminence say ? "
5536	5549	5551	5552	the Cardinal	430	" That to the old the impulsiveness of youth is eternally charming , "
5578	5588	5589	5589	he	109	" I am not a youth , your Eminence , "
5601	5607	5589	5589	he	109	" I am a man . "
5608	5635	5636	5636	Wogan	109	" But an Irishman , and that spells youth . You write poetry too , I believe , Mr. Wogan . It is a heady practice . "
5679	5741	5665	5665	He	109	" Look you , Mr. Wogan ; while the Emperor 's at war with Spain , while England 's fleet could strip him of Sicily , he 's England 's henchman . He dare not let the Princess go . We know it . General Heister , the Governor of Innspruck , is under pain of death to hold her safe . "
5742	5756	5782	5783	The Cardinal	430	" But , sir , would the world stop if General Heister died ? "
5757	5765	5782	5783	The Cardinal	430	" A German scaffold if you fail . "
5766	5781	5782	5783	The Cardinal	430	" In the matter of scaffolds I have no leaning towards any one nationality . "
5810	5815	5803	5803	his	348	" It is impossible . "
5841	5965	5966	5966	Wogan	109	" Sir , will you allow me to tell you a story,—a story of an impossible escape from Newgate in the heart of London by a man in fetters ? There were nine grenadiers with loaded muskets standing over him . There were two courtyards to cross , two walls to climb , and beyond the walls the unfriendly streets . The man hoodwinked his sentries , climbed his two walls , crossed the unfriendly streets , and took refuge in a cellar , where he was discovered . From the cellar in broad daylight he fought his way to the roofs , and on the roofs he played such a game of hide - and - seek among the chimney - tops — "
6006	6014	6015	6015	he	109	" Give me leave , your Majesty , "
6019	6061	6063	6063	he	109	" Let me go upon this errand . If I fail , if the scaffold 's dressed for me , why where 's the harm ? Your Majesty loses one servant out of his many . Whereas , if I win — "
6069	6101	6063	6063	he	109	" Aye , and I shall win ! There 's the Princess , too , a prisoner . Sir , she has ventured much . I beg you give me leave . "
6134	6161	6124	6125	the Cardinal	430	" I will wager Mr. Wogan a box at the Opera on the first night that he returns , that he will return empty - handed . "
6173	6214	6162	6162	Wogan	109	" It 's a wager I take the more readily in that your Eminence can not win , though you may lose . For if I return empty - handed , upon my honour I 'll not return at all . "
6286	6322	6283	6283	he	348	" I would that I could laugh so . You and Whittington , I do envy you . An honest laugh , there 's the purge for melancholy . But I can not compass it , "
6328	6350	6283	6283	he	348	" Sure , sir , you 'll put us all to shame when I bring her Royal Highness out of Innspruck . "
6351	6356	6358	6359	the Chevalier	348	" Oh , that ! "
6370	6375	6358	6359	the Chevalier	348	" It is impossible , "
6425	6468	6408	6408	he	348	" The house stands in the faubourgs of Innspruck . There is an avenue of trees in front of the house ; on the opposite side of the avenue there is a tavern with the sign of ' The White Chamois . ' "
6476	6483	6485	6486	the Chevalier	348	" The Princess and her mother , "
6488	6499	6485	6486	the Chevalier	348	" are imprisoned in the east side of the house . "
6500	6507	6509	6509	Wogan	109	" And how guarded , sir ? "
6519	6552	6511	6512	The Chevalier	348	" A sentry at each door , a third beneath the prisoners ' windows . They keep watch night and day . Besides , twice a day the magistrate visits the house . "
6553	6558	6511	6512	The Chevalier	348	" At what hours ? "
6559	6572	6511	6512	The Chevalier	348	" At ten in the morning . The same hour at night . "
6573	6584	6511	6512	The Chevalier	348	" And on each visit the magistrate sees the Princess ? "
6585	6593	6594	6594	Wogan	109	" Yes , though she lies abed . "
6605	6627	6599	6600	The Cardinal	430	" I trust , Mr. Wogan , that we shall hear Farini . There is talk of his coming to Bologna . "
6652	6656	6650	6650	them	452	" All 's well "
6666	6677	6663	6663	he	109	" Has the Princess her own servants to attend her ? "
6678	6686	6650	6650	them	452	" Only M. Chateaudoux , her chamberlain . "
6687	6690	6691	6691	Wogan	109	" Ah ! "
6713	6724	6691	6691	Wogan	109	" And M. Chateaudoux is allowed to come and go ? "
6725	6730	6731	6731	Wogan	109	" In the daylight . "
6737	6749	6750	6750	Wogan	109	" The box will be the best box in the house , "
6753	6758	6760	6761	the Cardinal	430	" Oh , sir , "
6763	6773	6760	6761	the Cardinal	430	" on the first tier , to be sure . "
6781	6840	6774	6774	Wogan	109	" All that I need now is a letter from your Majesty to the King of Poland and a few rascally guineas . I can leave Bologna before a soul 's astir in the morning . No one but Whittington saw me to - day , and a word will keep him silent . There will be secrecy — "
6849	6852	6854	6854	he	348	" No , "
6867	6888	6854	6854	he	348	" Here 's a blow that we must bend to ! It 's a dream , this plan of yours . "
6889	6908	6910	6910	Wogan	109	" But a dream I 'll dream so hard , sir , that I 'll dream it true , "
6915	6920	6922	6923	the Chevalier	348	" No , no , "
6925	6951	6922	6923	the Chevalier	348	" We 'll talk no more of it . There 's God 's will evident in this arrest , and we must bend to it ; "
7003	7006	7008	7008	he	348	" Sir , "
7012	7054	7008	7008	he	348	" I have never told you , but the Princess Clementina when a child amongst her playmates had a favourite game . They called it kings and queens . And in that game the Princess was always chosen Queen of England . "
7059	7064	7066	7066	he	348	" Is that so ? "
7081	7088	7066	7066	he	348	" In very truth it is , "
7128	7137	7139	7139	Wogan	126	" There indeed is God 's finger pointing , "
7141	7151	7139	7139	Wogan	126	" Sir , give me leave to follow it . "
7167	7183	7163	7163	he	114	" Go , then , and God speed you ! You are a gallant gentleman . "
7222	7230	7232	7233	the Chevalier	114	" You will have preparations to make , "
7235	7246	7232	7233	the Chevalier	114	" I will not keep you . You have horses ? "
7257	7260	7261	7261	he	114	" But , "
7264	7291	7261	7261	he	114	" there is a horse I left this morning six miles this side of Fiesole , a black horse , and I would not lose it . "
7292	7297	7299	7300	the Chevalier	348	" Nor shall you , "
7588	7596	7598	7598	he	111	" So , indeed , I thought , "
7683	7688	7689	7689	she	492	" You are early , "
7695	7704	7706	7706	Whittington	111	" And yet no earlier than your Ladyship , "
7708	7719	7721	7721	she	492	" I have to make my obeisance to my King , "
7727	7742	7721	7721	she	492	" Could one , I ask you , sleep on so important a day ? "
7786	7789	7790	7790	she	492	" Well ? "
7805	7850	7794	7794	Whittington	111	" Charles Wogan left Bologna at daybreak . Moreover , I have had a message from the Chevalier bidding me not to mention that I saw him in Bologna yesterday . One could hazard a guess at the goal of so secret a journey . "
7851	7854	7856	7857	the lady	219	" Ohlau ! "
7881	7891	7892	7892	she	492	" So there 's an end of Mr. Wogan , "
7901	7912	7913	7913	she	492	" For there 's no chance that he 'll succeed , "
7936	7964	7930	7930	He	111	" What is the sharpest spur a man can know ? What is it that gives a man audacity to attempt and wit to accomplish the impossible ? "
7969	7976	7978	7978	she	492	" The poets tell us love , "
7987	7997	7984	7984	his	111	" Wogan speaks very warmly of the Princess Clementina . "
8014	8018	8019	8019	she	219	" I wonder , "
8023	8030	8032	8032	Whittington	111	" Yes , I too wonder , "
8664	8669	8670	8670	he	125	" I want nothing , "
8673	8679	8681	8681	he	125	" nothing in the world ; "
8694	8701	8703	8704	the hawker	517	" A purse , good gentleman , "
8724	8728	8729	8729	he	125	" Go away , "
8732	8749	8729	8729	he	125	" I have a sufficiency of purses , and I will not be plagued by you . "
8777	8788	8790	8790	he	538	" What have you there ? Bring your basket here , "
8807	8818	8819	8819	he	538	" It is only the poor who have kind hearts , "
8822	8851	8819	8819	he	538	" here 's the proper purse for a soldier . It is so hard to get the money out that a man is saved an ocean of drink . "
8865	8869	8870	8870	he	538	" Go away , "
8873	8876	8870	8870	he	538	" quick ! "
8877	8884	8885	8886	The sentinel	541	" You will buy the purse ? "
8892	8899	8901	8902	the hawker	517	" Then the kind gentleman will , "
8966	8969	8971	8971	he	541	" Go , "
9228	9233	9214	9214	He	125	" To M. Chateaudoux , "
9265	9272	9274	9274	Friederika	127	" I am heart - broken , "
9276	9364	9274	9274	Friederika	127	" but my fidelity to my Chateaudoux has not faltered , nor will not , whatever I may be called upon to endure . I can not , however , be so undutiful as to accept my Chateaudoux 's addresses without my father 's consent ; and my mother , who is of the same mind with me , insists that even with that consent a runaway marriage is not to be thought of unless my Chateaudoux can provide me with a suitable woman for an attendant . "
9880	9883	9885	9885	he	109	" No , "
9889	9941	9885	9885	he	109	" I must now think of my daughter . Her dignity and her birth forbid that she should run like a criminal in fear of capture , and at the peril very likely of her life , to a king who , after all , is as yet without a crown . "
9955	10039	9951	9951	he	109	" I frankly say to you , Mr. Warner , that I know no one to whom I would sooner entrust my daughter than yourself , were I persuaded to this project . But it is doomed to fail . It would make us the laughing - stock of Europe , and I ask you to forget it . Do you fancy the Emperor guards my daughter so ill that you , single - handed , can take her from beneath his hand ? "
10040	10054	9951	9951	he	109	" Your Highness , I shall choose some tried friends to help me . "
10055	10190	9951	9951	he	109	" There is no single chance of success . I ask you to forget it and to pass your Christmas here as my very good friend . The sight is longer in age , Mr. Warner , than in youth , and I see far enough now to know that the days of Don Quixote are dead . Here is a matter where all Europe is ranged and alert on one side or the other . You can not practise secrecy . At Ohlau your face is known , your incognito too . Mr. Warner came to Ohlau once before , and the business on which he came is common knowledge . The motive of your visit now , which I tell you openly is very grateful to me , will surely be suspected . "
10269	10293	10258	10258	she	598	" It is our turn now . Here , Mr. Warner , is an acrostic which I ask you to solve for me . "
10347	10350	10351	10351	Wogan	109	" Clementina . "
10357	10368	10370	10370	he	109	" I can make neither head nor tail of it , "
10372	10380	10370	10370	he	109	" The attempt is beyond my powers . "
10381	10384	10386	10386	she	598	" Ah , "
10390	10407	10386	10386	she	598	" you own as much ? I would never have believed you would have owned it . "
10408	10415	10370	10370	he	109	" But what is the answer ? "
10424	10428	10430	10431	the Countess	599	" The answer , "
10433	10449	10451	10451	she	598	" is Mary , Queen of Scots , who was most unjustly imprisoned in Fotheringay , "
10493	10507	10509	10510	the Countess	599	" I should have presented you before to my friend , Lady Featherstone , "
10512	10521	10509	10510	the Countess	599	" but it seems you are already acquainted . "
10522	10536	10538	10539	Lady Featherstone	134	" Indeed , Mr. Warner did me a great service at a pinch , "
10541	10560	10538	10539	Lady Featherstone	134	" He was my postillion , though I never paid him , as I do now in thanks . "
10561	10565	10567	10572	one or two of the ladies	603	" Your postillion ! "
10592	10598	10600	10600	she	134	" I bade him hurry , "
10602	10683	10600	10600	she	134	" and he outsped my bidding . Never was there a postillion so considerately inconsiderate . I was tossed like a tennis ball , I was one black bruise , I bounced from cushion to cushion ; and then he drew up with a jerk , sprang off his horse , vanished into a house and left me , panting and dishevelled , a twist of torn ribbons and lace , alone in my carriage in the streets of Bologna . "
10684	10689	10691	10692	the Countess	599	" Bologna . Ah ! "
10748	10755	10756	10756	he	109	" Your Ladyship , I remember , "
10759	10775	10756	10756	he	109	" gave me to understand that you were sorely put to it to reach Bologna . "
10791	10795	10796	10796	she	493	" My brother , "
10799	10845	10796	10796	she	493	" lay at death 's door in Venice . I had just landed at Leghorn , where I left my maid to recover from the sea , and hurrying across Italy as I did , I still feared that I should not see him alive . "
10921	10929	10931	10932	Lady Featherstone	134	" I was able , most happily , "
10934	10980	10931	10932	Lady Featherstone	134	" to send my brother homewards in a ship a fortnight back , and so to stay with my friend here on my way to Vienna , for we English are all bitten with the madness of travel . Mr. Warner will bear me out ? "
10981	10988	10990	10990	Wogan	109	" To be sure I will , "
10994	11011	10990	10990	Wogan	109	" For here am I in the depths of winter journeying to the carnival in Italy . "
11029	11041	11043	11043	she	599	" For my frankness I claim a like frankness in return , "
11098	11104	11106	11106	she	599	" You spoke in parables , "
11108	11159	11106	11106	she	599	" which are detestable things . You said you would not lose your black horse for the world because the lady you were to marry would ride upon it into your city of dreams . There 's a saying that has a provoking prettiness . I claim a frank answer . "
11175	11178	11180	11180	one	3129	" Come , "
11199	11207	11209	11209	she	615	" We shall not let you off , "
11254	11258	11260	11261	the Countess	599	" Be frank , "
11263	11279	11260	11261	the Countess	599	" it is a matter of the heart , and so proper food for women . "
11280	11283	11285	11285	Wogan	109	" True , "
11289	11311	11285	11285	Wogan	109	" it is a matter of the heart , and in such matters can one be frank — even to oneself ? "
11346	11349	11350	11350	she	615	" Yes , "
11354	11363	11365	11365	she	615	" are you frank , even to yourself ? "
11436	11451	11434	11434	she	137	" that black care upon the horseman 's back which the poets write about . "
12050	12054	12056	12056	Wogan	109	" The King , "
12063	12069	12056	12056	Wogan	109	" leaves Bologna for Rome . "
12070	12078	12080	12081	the Prince	588	" So the letter came from him ? "
12096	12103	12105	12105	Wogan	109	" And in his own hand , "
12168	12182	12161	12161	her	652	" Single - handed you could do nothing . You would need friends . "
12199	12204	12206	12206	he	109	" On that slip , "
12208	12254	12206	12206	he	109	" I wrote down the names of all the friends whom I could trust , and by the side of the names the places where I could lay my hands upon them . One after the other I erased the names until only three remained . "
12264	12276	12255	12256	The Prince	588	" Gaydon , Misset , O'Toole . They are good men ? "
12277	12295	12386	12387	the Prince	588	" The flower of Ireland . Those three names have been my comfort these last three weeks . "
12296	12309	12386	12387	the Prince	588	" And all the three at Schlestadt . How comes that about ? "
12310	12332	12255	12256	The Prince	588	" Your Highness , they are all three officers in Dillon 's Irish regiment , and so have that further advantage . "
12333	12336	12386	12387	the Prince	588	" Advantage ? "
12337	12341	12343	12343	Wogan	109	" Your Highness , "
12345	12376	12343	12343	Wogan	109	" Schlestadt is near to Strasbourg , which again is not far from Innspruck , and being in French territory would be the most convenient place to set off from . "
12506	12508	12491	12491	he	109	" Schlestadt "
12527	12544	12516	12516	he	109	" My daughter wrote that a woman must attend her . It is a necessary provision . "
12545	12560	12491	12491	he	109	" Your Highness , Misset has a wife , and the wife matches him . "
12561	12569	12491	12491	he	109	" They are warned to be ready ? "
12570	12619	12516	12516	he	109	" At your Highness 's first word that slip of paper travels to Schlestadt . It is unsigned , it imperils no one , it betrays nothing . But it will tell its story none the less surely to those three men , for Gaydon knows my hand . "
12626	12639	12641	12641	he	588	" You have prudence , Mr. Warner , as well as audacity , "
12670	12682	12661	12661	her	599	" The Prince 's letter was in his own hand too ? "
12683	12688	12693	12694	The Prince	588	" But in cipher . "
12689	12692	12693	12694	The Prince	588	" Ah ! "
12714	12717	12719	12719	he	588	" Ciphers , "
12721	12737	12719	12719	he	588	" are curious things , compelling to the imagination and a provocation to the intellect . "
12785	12807	12808	12808	His	588	" If your Highness will do me the honour to look at this cipher . It has baffled the most expert . "
12852	12856	12857	12857	she	598	" Mr. Warner , "
12860	12873	12857	12857	she	598	" will you do me the favour to screw this wire tighter ? "
12885	12892	12894	12895	the Prince	588	" May I claim that privilege ? "
12897	12906	12908	12909	the Countess	599	" Your Highness does me too much honour , "
14499	14509	14511	14511	he	109	" I have not seen Lady Featherstone this evening , "
14513	14518	14520	14521	the Countess	599	" Have you not ? "
14525	14533	14535	14535	Wogan	109	" Not so much as her foot , "
14878	14887	14889	14889	he	109	" I shall go by way of Prague ; "
14898	14914	14889	14889	he	109	" At least , I am not sure . There are other ways into Italy . "
15279	15283	15285	15286	the treasurer	761	" Mr. Warner , "
15288	15312	15285	15286	the treasurer	761	" his Highness has hinted to me his desires ; he has moulded them into the shape of a prayer or a request . "
15313	15323	15325	15325	Wogan	109	" In a word , he has bidden you , "
15327	15412	15325	15325	Wogan	109	" Fie , sir ! There 's a barbarous and improper word , an ill - sounding word ; upon my honour , a word without dignity or merit and banishable from polite speech . His Highness did most prettily entreat me with a fine gentleness of condescension befitting a Sunday or a New Year 's Day to bring and present and communicate from hand to hand a gift,—a most incomparable proper gift , the mirror and image of his most incomparable proper friendship . "
15432	15491	15545	15546	The treasurer	761	" Nay , Mr. Warner , I must be concise , puritanical , and unadorned in my language as any raw - head or bloody - bones . The cruel , irrevocable moments pass . I could consume an hour , sir , before I touched as I may say the hem of the reason of my coming . "
15492	15501	15503	15503	Wogan	109	" Sir , I do not doubt it , "
15505	15544	15503	15503	Wogan	109	" But I will not hinder you from forthwith immediately and at once incorporating with your most particular and inestimable treasures this jewel , this turquoise of heaven 's own charming blue , encased and decorated with gold . "
15576	15583	15585	15585	he	109	" I can not take it , "
15587	15590	15592	15593	the treasurer	761	" Gemini ! "
15595	15629	15592	15593	the treasurer	761	" But it is more than a turquoise , Mr. Warner . Jewellers have delved in it . It has become subservient to man 's necessities . It is a snuff - box . "
15630	15637	15563	15563	He	761	" I can not take it . "
15638	15681	15682	15682	Wogan	109	" King John of Poland , he whom the vulgar call Glorious John , did rescue and enlarge it from its slavery to the Grand Vizier of Turkey at the great battle of Vienna . There is no other in the world — "
15688	15738	15682	15682	Wogan	109	" You will take it again to his Highness . You will express to him my gratitude for his kindness , and you will say furthermore these words : ' Mr. Warner can not carry back into Italy a present for himself and a refusal for his Prince . ' "
15766	15772	15773	15773	he	109	" Here is a quandary ! "
15776	15786	15773	15773	he	109	" I do declare every circumstance of me trembles , "
15803	15850	15799	15799	he	109	" His Highness distinguishes you , Mr. Warner , with imperishable honours . His Highness solicits your company to a solitary dinner . You shall dine with him alone . His presence and unfettered conversation shall season your soup and be the condiments of your meat . "
15908	15924	15926	15926	he	109	" See , Mr. Wogan , your persuasions and your conduct have gained me over , "
15928	15992	15926	15926	he	109	" Your refusal of this bagatelle assures me of your honour . I trust myself entirely to your discretion ; I confide my beloved daughter to your care . Take from my hands the gift you refused this morning , and be assured that no prince ever gave to any man such full powers as I will give to you to - night . "
16582	16593	16594	16594	he	109	" Is there an inn where a traveller may sleep ? "
16597	16600	16602	16603	the man	365	" Assuredly , "
16605	16627	16602	16603	the man	365	" and find forage for his horse . The last house — but I will myself show your Honour the way . "
16628	16644	16646	16646	Wogan	109	" There is no need , my friend , that you should take a colic , "
16648	16659	16661	16662	the man	365	" I shall earn enough drink to correct the colic , "
16825	16829	16831	16831	he	218	" My man , "
16833	16842	16831	16831	he	218	" will take your horse to the stable ; "
16855	16863	16865	16865	Wogan	109	" Oh , is he your man ? "
16867	16870	16865	16865	Wogan	109	" Ah ! "
16904	16911	16913	16913	he	218	" Have a care , sir , "
16915	16938	16913	16913	he	218	" the walls are wet . It will be best if you stand still while I go forward and bring a light . "
17013	17017	17019	17019	he	109	" The hospitality , "
17023	17062	17019	17019	he	109	" which plants a man in the road so that a traveller on a rainy night may not miss his bed should at least leave the kitchen door open . Why should I stay here in the dark ? "
17186	17193	17194	17195	the landlord	218	" What ! Are you going ? "
17213	17222	17194	17195	the landlord	218	" Wilhelm has a wife and needs must , "
17251	17259	17261	17261	he	218	" You found your way , sir , "
17268	17281	17285	17285	he	109	" Nor are your walls any poorer of paint on that account , "
17352	17361	17363	17364	the landlord	218	" You laugh at my paint , sir , "
17396	17457	17366	17366	He	218	" You laugh at my paint , but it is , after all , a very important thing . What is a great lady without her rouge - pot , when you come to think of it ? It is the same with an inn . It must wear paint if it is to attract attention and make a profit . "
17458	17466	17468	17468	Wogan	109	" There is philosophy in the comparison , "
17470	17547	17468	17468	Wogan	109	" Sir , an innkeeper can not fail of philosophy if he has his eyes and a spark of intelligence . The man who took refuge in a tub because the follies of his fellows so angered him was the greatest fool of them all . He should have kept an inn on the road to Athens , for then the follies would have put money into his pocket and made him laugh instead of growl . "
17563	17569	17571	17571	she	589	" The supper is ready , "
17573	17594	17571	17571	she	589	" And perhaps , sir , while you are eating it you can think of a name for my inn . "
17595	17606	17608	17608	Wogan	109	" Why , it has a sign - board already , "
17610	17620	17608	17608	Wogan	109	" and a name , too , I suppose . "
17621	17634	17636	17637	the landlord	218	" It has a sign - board , but without a device , "
17653	17790	17648	17648	he	109	" There is another inn five miles along the road , and travellers prefer to make their halt there . They will not stop here . My father , sir , set it all down to paint . It was his dream , sir , to paint the house from floor to ceiling ; his last words bade me pinch and save until I could paint . Well , here is the house painted , and I am anxious for a new device and name which shall obliterate the memory of the other . ' The Black Eagle ' is its old name . Ask any traveller familiar with the road between Augsburg and Schlestadt , and he will counsel you to avoid ' The Black Eagle . ' You are travelling to Schlestadt , perhaps . "
17798	17802	17803	17803	he	109	" To Strasbourg , "
17819	17823	17817	17817	himself	109	" My friend , "
17829	17871	17825	17825	his	109	" the sooner you reach Schlestadt the better . Here are you bleating like a sheep at a mere chance mention of your destination . You have lived too close with this fine scheme of yours . You need your friends . "
17999	18018	17989	17989	Wogan	109	" You have not spent much of your new paint on your guest - room , my friend . "
18019	18029	18031	18032	his host	838	" Sir , you have not marked the door , "
18036	18039	18041	18041	Wogan	109	" True , "
18047	18054	18041	18041	Wogan	109	" the door is admirably white . "
18055	18068	18069	18070	The landlord	218	" The frame of the door does not suffer in a comparison . "
18081	18096	18098	18098	Wogan	109	" I do not wish to be unjust to the frame of the door , "
18712	18715	18717	18717	Wogan	109	" True , "
18719	18730	18717	18717	Wogan	109	" the man wants a new name for his inn . "
19949	19960	19961	19961	Wogan	109	" You must lie there till morning , my friend , "
19967	20027	19961	19961	Wogan	109	" but here 's a thing to console you . I have found a name for your inn ; I have painted the device upon your sign - board . The ' Inn of the Five Red Fingers . ' There 's never a passer - by but will stop to inquire the reason of so conspicuous a sign ; "
20138	20147	20148	20148	he	109	" There was no key in the door , "
20151	20184	20148	20148	he	109	" I should have noticed it . Misset , the man of resources , would have tilted a chair backwards against that door with its top bar wedged beneath the door handle . "
20271	20274	20275	20275	he	109	" Gaydon , "
20293	20343	20275	20275	he	109	" would go no further to - day with this letter in his pocket . Gaydon — the cautious Gaydon — would sleep in this town and in its most populous quarter . Gaydon would put up at the busiest inn . Charles Wogan will follow Gaydon 's example . "
20428	20434	20436	20436	he	109	" Gaydon would stop here , "
20451	20457	20459	20459	Wogan	109	" I need a room , "
20507	20510	20512	20512	Wogan	109	" No , "
20523	20536	20515	20515	he	109	" here , to be sure , is where Gaydon would sleep . "
20956	20959	20961	20961	Wogan	109	" Sure , "
20963	21080	20961	20961	Wogan	109	" here is a lesson for architects . Build no shutters to a house when the man that has to live in it has a spark of imagination , else will he go stark raving mad before the mortar 's dry . Window shutters are window shutters , but they are the doors of Bedlam as well . Now Gaydon should have slept in this room . Gaydon 's a great man . Gaydon has a great deal of observation and common sense , and was never plagued with a flim - flam of fancies . To be sure , I need Gaydon , but since I have not Gaydon , I 'll light a candle . "
21547	21556	21544	21544	Wogan	109	" Gaydon would never have overlooked that cupboard . "
21770	21788	21762	21762	him	872	" It is nothing . Go to bed ! I fell over a chair in the dark . "
22067	22071	22072	22072	he	109	way,—"Who is that ? "
22082	22087	22089	22090	the landlord	218	" Who is that ? "
22096	22101	22103	22103	Wogan	109	" Who is that ? "
22112	22125	22103	22103	Wogan	109	" Why , sir , your servant . Who should he be ? "
22145	22148	22150	22150	Wogan	109	" Ah ! "
22152	22159	22150	22150	Wogan	109	" he came here with me ? "
22160	22169	22170	22171	The landlord	218	" Yes , since he is your servant . "
22203	22208	22210	22210	he	218	" To be sure , "
22212	22228	22210	22210	he	218	" I know . This is my servant . That is precisely what I mean . "
22243	22252	22253	22253	he	109	" This is my servant ? What then ? "
22257	22264	22266	22267	the landlord	218	" But I do n't understand , "
22269	22275	22277	22277	Wogan	109	" You do n't understand ! "
22279	22301	22277	22277	Wogan	109	" Was there ever such a landlord ? He does not understand . This is my servant , I tell you . "
22302	22311	22266	22267	the landlord	218	" Yes , sir , but — but — "
22312	22315	22266	22267	the landlord	218	" Well ? "
22316	22332	22277	22277	Wogan	109	" We were roused — there was a noise — a noise of men fighting . "
22333	22341	22343	22343	Wogan	109	" There would have been no noise , "
22347	22372	22343	22343	Wogan	109	" if you had prepared a bed for my servant . He would not have crept into my cupboard to sleep off his drunkenness . "
22373	22383	22277	22277	Wogan	109	" But , sir , there was a bed . "
22384	22434	22435	22435	Wogan	109	" You should have seen that he was carried to it . As it is , here have I been driven to beat him and to lose my night 's rest in consequence . It is not fitting . I do not think that your inn is well managed . "
22464	22472	22474	22474	he	218	" We will carry the fellow away , "
22476	22485	22487	22487	Wogan	109	" You will do nothing of the kind , "
22489	22510	22487	22487	Wogan	109	" He shall get back into his cupboard and there he shall remain till daybreak . Come , get up ! "
22560	22565	22567	22567	Wogan	109	" In with you , "
22595	22604	22606	22607	the landlord	218	" There is no lock to the door , "
22609	22618	22620	22620	Wogan	109	" There is no need of a lock , "
22622	22659	22620	22620	Wogan	109	" so long as one has a chair . The fellow will do very well till the morning . But I will take your three candles , for it is not likely that I shall sleep . "
22782	22788	22790	22790	he	109	" It was that night , "
22794	22858	22790	22790	he	109	" when the Prince sat by the Countess with the list of my friends in his hands . The names were all erased but three , and against those three was that other name of Schlestadt . No doubt the Countess while she bent over her harp - strings took a look at that list . I must run the gauntlet into Schlestadt . "
23108	23114	23116	23117	his host	838	" You will sleep here ? "
23119	23129	23116	23117	his host	838	" I will at all events lie in bed , "
23148	23155	23157	23157	he	979	" Have a care , sir , "
23159	23165	23157	23157	he	979	" the stairs are steep . "
23166	23172	23133	23134	The innkeeper	979	" I prefer them steep . "
23173	23196	23157	23157	he	979	" I am afraid that I keep the light from you , but there is no room for two to walk abreast . "
23197	23214	23215	23216	The landlord	218	" It is an advantage . I do not like to be jostled on the stairs . "
23228	23235	23236	23236	he	218	" The room is a garret , "
23241	23255	23236	23236	he	218	" So long as it has no cupboards it will serve my turn . "
23256	23265	23157	23157	he	979	" Ah ! you do not like cupboards . "
23266	23284	23236	23236	he	218	" They fill a poor man with envy of those who have clothes to hang in them . "
23321	23328	23330	23330	Wogan	109	" It is a good garret , "
23340	23346	23348	23349	the landlord	218	" The window is small , "
23351	23361	23363	23363	Wogan	109	" One will be less likely to fall out , "
23439	23442	23444	23444	he	109	" Oho ! "
23453	23463	23447	23447	he	109	" here 's a man in a mighty hurry . "
23518	23526	23528	23528	Wogan	109	" Yes , your garret will do , "
23647	23652	23654	23654	he	109	" Get my supper , "
23656	23663	23654	23654	he	109	" for I am very tired . "
23664	23671	23673	23674	the landlord	218	" Will your Excellency sup here ? "
23676	23683	23673	23674	the landlord	218	" By no manner of means , "
23699	23710	23711	23711	He	109	" I detest nothing so much as my own company . "
23765	23771	23773	23773	Wogan	109	" You have been running , "
23777	23807	23809	23810	the fellow	3410	" Sir , running is a poor man 's overcoat for a chilly evening ; besides it helps me to pay with patience the price of wine for vinegar ; "
23845	23852	23854	23854	Wogan	109	" You have a good trade , "
23859	23866	23854	23854	Wogan	109	" The mill brings me custom . "
24123	24129	24131	24131	Wogan	109	" I know enough now , "
24133	24160	24131	24131	Wogan	109	" I can go to bed . The staircase is a pretty place with which we shall all be more familiar in an hour or two . "
24215	24229	24212	24212	he	109	" I find the room hot , and will stay by the door . "
24421	24425	24427	24427	he	109	" Five men , "
24429	24494	24427	24427	he	109	" upon a narrow staircase are merely one man who has to be killed five times , but five men in a room are five simultaneous assailants . I need O'Toole here , I need O'Toole 's six feet four and the length of his arm and the weight of him — these things I need — but are there five or only four ? "
24887	24905	24853	24855	the polite man	1030	" I think , sir , you ought to know that we are all very poor men . "
24906	24911	24913	24913	Wogan	109	" I , too , "
24915	24920	24913	24913	Wogan	109	" am an Irishman . "
24938	24953	24930	24930	his	1030	" I think you ought to know that we are all very poor men . "
24954	24961	24963	24963	Wogan	109	" The repetition of the remark , "
24965	24973	24963	24963	Wogan	109	" argues certainly a poverty of ideas . "
24974	24982	24930	24930	his	1030	" We wish to become less poor . "
24983	24997	24930	24930	his	1030	" It is an aspiration which has pushed many men to creditable feats . "
24998	25004	24930	24930	his	1030	" You can help us . "
25005	25013	25015	25015	Wogan	109	" My prayers are at your disposal , "
25017	25024	25026	25026	he	1030	" By more than your prayers ; "
25034	25041	25026	25026	he	1030	" there are five of us . "
25042	25052	25054	25054	Wogan	109	" Then I have a guinea apiece for you , "
25075	25092	25093	25093	Wogan	109	" We do not want your money . You have a letter which we can coin . "
25096	25105	25093	25093	Wogan	109	" There , sir , you are wrong . "
25114	25121	25123	25123	he	1030	" A letter from Prince Sobieski , "
25125	25146	25123	25123	he	1030	" I had such a letter a minute ago , but I lit my pipe with it under your nose . "
25171	25177	25161	25164	The servant from Ohlau	1036	" It 's a lie . "
25187	25194	25196	25196	he	109	" Here 's a fine world , "
25198	25211	25196	25196	he	109	" A damned rag of a lackey gives a gentleman the lie . "
25212	25220	25222	25224	the polite man	1030	" You will give me the letter , "
25240	25251	25253	25253	Wogan	109	" You can sweep up the ashes from the hearth , "
25512	25529	25531	25531	Wogan	109	" There 's a New Year 's gift for your mistress , the Countess of Berg , "
26192	26207	26208	26208	he	109	" I have a loaded pistol , my friends ; you have forgotten that , "
26542	26548	26549	26549	he	109	" Aha , my friend , "
26552	26571	26549	26549	he	109	" you handle a sword very prettily , but I am the better man at cock - shies . "
28025	28030	28031	28031	he	737	" Who is it ? "
28048	28078	28031	28031	he	737	" A man wounded and in sore straits for his life , who would gladly sit for a few minutes by your fire before he goes upon his way . "
28122	28129	28131	28131	Wogan	109	" I am the Chevalier Warner , "
28133	28161	28131	28131	Wogan	109	" a gentleman of Ireland . You will pardon me . But I have gone through so much these last three nights that I can barely stand ; "
28190	28210	28211	28211	He	737	" I am Count Otto von Ahlen , and in my house you are safe as you are welcome . "
28366	28369	28371	28371	Wogan	109	" Sir , "
28373	28419	28371	28371	Wogan	109	" my visit is the most unceremonious thing in the world . I plump in upon you in the dark of the morning , as I take it to be , and disturb you at your books without so much as knocking at the door . "
28420	28433	28435	28436	the Count	1129	" It is as well you did not knock at the door , "
28438	28462	28464	28464	he	1129	" for my servants are long since in bed , and your knock would very likely have reached neither their ears nor mine . "
28517	28550	28510	28510	Wogan	109	" Yet I might be any hedgerow rascal with a taste for your plate , and no particular scruples as to a life or two lying in the way of its gratification . "
28555	28612	28614	28614	he	1129	" Your visit is not so unexampled as you are inclined to think . Nearly thirty years ago a young man as you are came in just such a plight as you and stood outside this window at two o'clock of a dark morning . Even so early in my life I was at my books , "
28619	28723	28614	28614	he	1129	" I let him in and he talked to me for an hour of matters strange and dreamlike , and enviable to me . I have never forgotten that hour , nor to tell the truth have I ever ceased to envy the man who talked to me during it , though many years since he suffered a dreadful doom and vanished from among his fellows . I shall be glad , therefore , to hear your story if you have a mind to tell it me . The young man who came upon that other night was Count Philip Christopher von Königsmarck . "
28788	28805	28807	28807	Wogan	109	" I have no such story as Count Philip von Königsmarck no doubt had to tell , "
28809	28812	28814	28815	Count Otto	153	" Chevalier , "
28823	28949	28951	28951	he	1136	" Königsmarck had the like reticence , though he was not always so discreet , I fear . The Princess Sophia Dorothea was at that time on a visit to the Duke of Würtemberg at the palace in Stuttgart , but Königsmarck told me only that he had snatched a breathing space from the wars in the Low Countries and was bound thither again . Rumour told me afterwards of his fatal attachment . He sat where you sit , Chevalier , wounded as you are , a fugitive from pursuit . Even the stains and disorder of his plight could not disguise the singular beauty of the man or make one insensible to the charm of his manner . But I forget my duties , "
28954	28972	28973	28973	he	1136	" It would be as well , no doubt , if I did not wake my servants ? "
28976	28980	28982	28982	Wogan	109	" Count Otto , "
28988	28999	28982	28982	Wogan	109	" they have their day 's work to - morrow . "
29128	29193	29194	29194	Wogan	109	" I fought , I climbed that wall , I crossed the lawn , I took refuge here for love of a queen . For love of a queen all my short life I lived . For love of a queen I died most horribly ; and the queen lives , though it would have gone better with her had she died as horribly . "
29388	29394	29395	29395	he	1129	" They are not deep , "
29398	29412	29395	29395	he	1129	" a few days ' rest and a clever surgeon will restore you . "
29443	29457	29459	29459	he	1129	" While you eat , Chevalier , I will mix you a cordial , "
29469	29575	29462	29462	he	1129	" You ask me why I so readily opened my window to you . It was because I took you for Königsmarck himself come back as mysteriously as he disappeared . I did not think that if he came back now his hair would be as white , his shoulders as bent , as mine . Indeed , one can not think of Königsmarck except as a youth . You had the very look of him as you stood in the light upon the lawn . You have , if I may say so , something of his gallant bearing and something of his grace . "
29590	29602	29603	29603	he	109	" Oh , stop , sir . I pray you stop ! "
29623	29671	29603	29603	he	109	" There , sir , I give you at once by my discourtesy an example of how little I merit a comparison with that courtly nobleman . Let me repair it by telling you , since you are willing to hear , of my night 's adventure . "
29771	29799	29800	29800	he	109	" To feel the blood run hot in one 's veins , to be bedfellows with peril , to go gallantly forward hand in hand with endeavour , "
29806	29858	29800	29800	he	109	" See , I own a sword , being a gentleman . But it is a toy , an ornament ; it stands over there in the corner from day to day , and my servants clean it from rust as they will . Now you , sir , I suppose — "
29859	29868	29870	29870	Wogan	109	" My horse and my sword , Count , "
29872	29900	29870	29870	Wogan	109	" when the pinch comes , they are one 's only servants . It would be an ill business if I did not see to their wants . "
29915	29934	29911	29911	he	737	" It was for a woman , no doubt , that you ran this hazard to - night ? "
29935	29942	29943	29944	The Count	1129	" For a woman , yes . "
29952	30029	29946	29946	his	1129	" Sir , a woman is a strange inexplicable thing to me . Their words , their looks , their graceful , delicate shapes , the motives which persuade them , the thoughts which their eyes conceal,—all these qualities make them beings of another world to me . I do envy men at times who can stand beside them , talk with them without fear , be intimate with them , and understand their intricate thoughts . "
30030	30036	30038	30038	Wogan	109	" Are there such men ? "
30040	30052	30053	30053	Wogan	109	" Men who love , such as Count Königsmarck and yourself . "
30062	30120	30053	30053	Wogan	109	" Count , such men , we are told , are the blindest of all . Did not Königsmarck prove it ? As for myself , not even in that respect can I be ranked with Königsmarck . I am a mere man - at - arms , whose love - making is a clash of steel . "
30121	30141	30169	30169	he	109	" But to - night — this risk you ran ; you told me it was for a woman . "
30142	30161	30162	30162	he	109	" For a woman , yes . For love of a woman , no , no , no ! "
30175	30183	30185	30185	he	109	" But I have stayed my time , "
30187	30204	30185	30185	he	109	" you have never had a more grateful guest . I beg you to believe it . "
30245	30531	30532	30532	He	1152	" Königsmarck spoke for an hour , mentioning no names , so that I who from my youth have lived apart could not make a guess . He spoke with a deal of passion ; it seemed that one hour his life was paradise and the next a hell . Even as he spoke he was one instant all faith and the next all despair . One moment he was filled with his unworthiness and wonder that so noble a creature as a woman should bend her heart and lips from her heaven down to his earth . The next he could not conceive any man should be such a witless ass as to stake his happiness on the steadiness of so manifest a weathercock as a woman 's favour . It was all very strange talk ; it opened to me , just as when a fog lifts and rolls down again , a momentary vision of a world of colours in which I had no share ; and to tell the truth it left me with a suspicion which has recurred again and again , that all my solitary years over my books , all the delights which the delicate turning of a phrase , or the chase and capture of an elusive idea , can bring to one may not be worth , after all , one single minute of living passion . Passion , Chevalier ! There is a word of which I know the meaning only by hearsay . But I wonder at times , whatever harm it works , whether there can be any great thing without it . But you are anxious to go forward upon your way . "
30558	30563	30565	30565	he	109	" I am wondering , "
30567	30585	30565	30565	he	109	" whether I might be yet deeper in your debt . I left behind me a sword . "
30603	30638	30586	30587	Count Otto	153	" I called it an ornament , and yet in other hands it might well prove a serviceable weapon . The blade is of Spanish steel . You will honour me by wearing it . "
30711	30717	30718	30718	he	109	" I had a pistol , "
30722	30739	30718	30718	he	109	" a very useful thing is a pistol , more useful at times than a sword . "
30740	30748	30750	30751	the Count	1129	" I keep one in my bedroom , "
30758	30774	30750	30751	the Count	1129	" if you can wait the few moments it will take me to fetch it . "
30810	30817	30798	30799	The Count	1129	" Will you now follow me ? "
30834	30871	30818	30818	Wogan	109	" A pistol is , to be sure , more useful than a sword ; but there is just one thing more useful on an occasion than a pistol , and that is a hunting knife . "
30878	30891	30875	30875	his	153	" There , Chevalier , I doubt if I can serve you . "
30892	30898	30900	30900	Wogan	109	" But upon my word , "
30912	30919	30900	30900	Wogan	109	" here is the very thing . "
30920	30926	30927	30927	Wogan	109	" It has no sheath . "
30966	30969	30971	30971	he	109	" Now , "
30975	30995	30971	30971	he	109	" all that I need is a sound , swift , thoroughbred horse about six or seven years old . "
31007	31013	31014	31014	he	153	" Will you follow me ? "
31066	31071	31073	31073	he	153	" Saddle me Flavia , "
31075	31089	31073	31073	he	153	" Flavia is a mare who , I fancy , fulfils your requirements . "
31152	31162	31164	31164	he	153	" Here , then , we part , Chevalier , "
31166	31292	31164	31164	he	153	" No doubt to - morrow I shall sit down at my table , knowing that I talked a deal of folly ill befitting an old man . No doubt I shall be aware that my books are the true happiness after all . But to - night — well , to - night I would fain be twenty years of age , that I might fling my books over the hedge and ride out with you , my sword at my side , my courage in my hand , into the world 's highway . I will beg you to keep the mare as a token and a memory of our meeting . There is no better beast , I believe , in Christendom . "
31303	31306	31308	31308	Wogan	109	" Count , "
31310	31336	31308	31308	Wogan	109	" I will gladly keep your mare in remembrance of your great goodwill to a stranger . But there is one better beast in Christendom . "
31337	31345	31164	31164	he	153	" Indeed ? And which is that ? "
31346	31368	31308	31308	Wogan	109	" Why , sir , the black horse which the lady I shall marry will ride into my city of dreams . "
32020	32023	32025	32025	he	1209	" Gaydon , "
32038	32041	32029	32033	The man at the table	1210	" Misset . "
32050	32056	32029	32033	The man at the table	1210	" I have an idea . "
32065	32071	32062	32062	Gaydon	142	" Let us hear it . "
32088	32094	32096	32096	he	158	" It is a lottery , "
32098	32121	32096	32096	he	158	" and we have made our fortunes . We three are the winners , and so our names are not crossed out . "
32122	32133	32135	32135	Gaydon	142	" But I have put no money in a lottery , "
32137	32141	32143	32143	Misset	143	" Nor I , "
32145	32154	32156	32156	O'Toole	158	" And where should I find money either ? "
32158	32187	32188	32188	Misset	143	" But Charles Wogan has borrowed it for us and paid it in , and so we 're all rich men . What 'll I buy with it ? "
32193	32201	32202	32202	he	158	" The paper came four days ago ? "
32205	32212	32202	32202	he	158	" Yes , in the morning . "
32213	32219	32221	32221	he	158	" Five days , then , "
32251	32259	32261	32261	Gaydon	142	" That 's the sound of horseshoes , "
32263	32275	32277	32277	Misset	143	" But there 's another sound keeping pace with the horseshoes , "
32296	32314	32315	32315	Gaydon	142	" It is very like the sound a gentleman makes when he reels home from a tavern . "
32337	32343	32345	32345	Misset	143	" What if it is ? "
32347	32356	32358	32358	Gaydon	142	" He was never drunk in his life , "
32360	32369	32371	32371	O'Toole	158	" It 's possible that he has reformed , "
32444	32458	32434	32434	O'Toole	158	" Is it a lottery ? Tell me we 're all rich men , "
32469	32480	32482	32482	Wogan	109	" I 'll tell you more wonderful things than that , "
32484	32496	32482	32482	Wogan	109	" when you have shown me the way to a stable . "
32497	32508	32510	32510	Gaydon	142	" There 's one at the back of the house , "
32512	32519	32510	32510	Gaydon	142	" I 'll take the horse . "
32520	32523	32525	32525	Wogan	109	" No , "
32542	32548	32550	32550	he	109	" There are two things , "
32552	32573	32550	32550	he	109	" a man never trusts to his friends . One 's his horse ; t ' other 's his wife . "
32588	32609	32610	32610	Misset	143	" It is a little maxim of philosophy . I have others . They come to me in the night . "
32719	32729	32731	32731	he	109	" I am not gone yet , my lady , "
32733	32738	32731	32731	he	109	" take your time . "
32778	32795	32766	32766	Gaydon	142	" You can take the saddles off . We shall need no horses to - night . "
32822	32867	32809	32809	Gaydon	142	" Not a word , not a question , till he has eaten , or we shall have him in bed for a twelvemonth . Misset , do you run for a doctor . O'Toole , see what you can find in the larder . "
33026	33031	33032	33032	he	109	" It is you , "
33035	33059	33032	33032	he	109	" There you are , the three of you , my good friends , and this is Schlestadt . But it is strange , "
33083	33091	33093	33093	he	109	" You received a slip of paper ? "
33095	33100	33102	33102	Gaydon	142	" Four days back , "
33104	33108	33102	33102	Gaydon	142	" And understood ? "
33109	33117	33132	33132	O'Toole	158	" That we were to be ready . "
33118	33121	33102	33102	Gaydon	142	" Good . "
33122	33130	33132	33132	O'Toole	158	" Then it 's not a lottery , "
33134	33142	33132	33132	O'Toole	158	" and we 've drawn no prizes . "
33143	33152	33154	33154	Wogan	109	" Ah , but we are going to , "
33156	33195	33154	33154	Wogan	109	" We are safe here . No one can hear us ; no one can burst in . But I am sure of that . Misset knows the trick that will make us safe from interruption , eh ? "
33202	33211	33213	33213	he	109	" Why , one can turn the key , "
33215	33220	33222	33222	Wogan	109	" To be sure , "
33246	33275	33241	33241	he	109	" if there 's a key ; but if there 's no key , why , a chair tilted against the door to catch the handle , eh ? "
33294	33307	33309	33309	Wogan	109	" We are to draw the greatest prize that ever was drawn , "
33316	33349	33312	33312	he	109	" But is there a cupboard in the room ? No matter ; I forgot that this is Gaydon 's lodging , and Gaydon 's not the man to overlook a cupboard . "
33357	33367	33368	33368	he	142	" But upon my word there is a cupboard , "
33404	33412	33413	33413	he	109	" There will be nobody in it , "
33416	33438	33413	33413	he	109	" Gaydon will never feel a hand gripping the life out of his throat because he forgot to search a cupboard . "
33501	33513	33515	33515	Wogan	109	" We are to draw the biggest prize in all Europe , "
33517	33520	33522	33522	O'Toole	158	" There ! "
33524	33542	33522	33522	O'Toole	158	" Will you be pleased to remember when next I have an idea that I was right ? "
33543	33549	33551	33551	Wogan	109	" But not for ourselves , "
33558	33572	33574	33574	he	158	" Oh , we are to hand it on to a third party , "
33576	33579	33574	33574	he	158	" Yes . "
33580	33596	33553	33553	O'Toole	158	" Well , after all , that 's quite of a piece with our luck . "
33597	33604	33606	33606	Misset	143	" Who is the third party ? "
33608	33612	33606	33606	Misset	143	" The King . "
33629	33633	33635	33635	O'Toole	158	" The King , "
33637	33647	33648	33648	Gaydon	142	" to be sure , that makes a difference . "
33652	33659	33648	33648	Gaydon	142	" And what is the prize ? "
33660	33665	33667	33667	Wogan	109	" The Princess Clementina , "
33669	33681	33667	33667	Wogan	109	" We are to rescue her from her prison in Innspruck . "
33687	33691	33692	33692	he	142	" We four ! "
33695	33699	33701	33701	Misset	143	" We four ! "
33725	33736	33737	33737	O'Toole	158	" We four against a nation , against half Europe ! "
33758	33763	33765	33765	he	158	" I am ready , "
33776	33781	33783	33783	he	109	" I know that , "
33785	33807	33809	33809	he	109	" So are we all — all ready ; is not that so , my friends ? We four are ready . "
33817	33885	33809	33809	he	109	" Here 's an exploit , if we but carry it through , which even antiquity will be at pains to match ! It 's more than an exploit , for it has the sanctity of a crusade . On the one side there 's tyranny , oppression , injustice , the one woman who most deserves a crown robbed of it . And on the other — "
33886	33892	33894	33894	Gaydon	142	" There 's the King , "
33909	33912	33914	33914	he	109	" Yes , "
33916	33980	33914	33914	he	109	" there 's the King , and we four to serve him in his need . We are few , but in that lies our one hope . They will never look for four men , but for many . Four men travelling to the shrine of Loretto with the Pope 's passport may well stay at Innspruck and escape a close attention . "
33981	33986	33987	33987	O'Toole	158	" I am ready , "
33990	34014	33987	33987	O'Toole	158	" But we shall not start to - night . There 's the passport to be got , a plan to be arranged . "
34015	34023	34025	34025	O'Toole	158	" Oh , there 's a plan , "
34027	34038	34040	34040	he	109	" To be sure , there 's always a plan . "
34077	34086	34088	34088	Gaydon	142	" Is her Highness warned of the attempt ? "
34090	34101	34103	34103	Wogan	109	" As soon as I obtained the King 's permission , "
34105	34139	34140	34140	He	109	" I hurried to Innspruck . There I saw Chateaudoux , the chamberlain of the Princess 's mother . Here is a letter he dropped in the cathedral for me to pick up . "
34198	34204	34206	34206	he	142	" Chateaudoux has a sweetheart , "
34210	34223	34224	34224	Gaydon	142	" Very good ; I do not think the worse of him . "
34233	34248	34224	34224	Gaydon	142	" The Princess says that you must have the Prince Sobieski 's written consent . "
34249	34257	34259	34259	Wogan	109	" I went from Innspruck to Ohlau , "
34261	34305	34259	34259	Wogan	109	" I had some trouble , and the reason of my coming leaked out . The Countess de Berg suspected it from the first . She had a friend , an Englishwoman , Lady Featherstone , who was at Ohlau to outwit me . "
34306	34310	34312	34312	Misset	143	" Lady Featherstone ! "
34314	34320	34321	34321	Wogan	109	" Who can she be ? "
34355	34362	34364	34364	Gaydon	142	" So the secret 's out , "
34366	34372	34364	34364	Gaydon	142	" But you outstripped it . "
34373	34376	34378	34378	Wogan	109	" Barely , "
34380	34394	34378	34378	Wogan	109	" Forty miles away I had last night to fight for my life . "
34395	34405	34407	34407	Misset	143	" But you have the Prince 's written consent ? "
34409	34483	34484	34484	Misset	143	" I had last night , but I made a spill of it to light my pipe . There were six men against me . Had that been found on my dead body , why , there was proof positive of our attempt , and the attempt foiled by sure safeguards . As it is , if we lie still a little while , their fears will cease and the rumour become discredited . "
34495	34516	34484	34484	Misset	143	" But her Highness writes most clearly she will not move without that sure token of her father 's consent . "
34533	34591	34517	34517	Wogan	109	" Here 's a token no less sure . It was Prince Sobieski 's New Year 's gift to me,—a jewel unique and in an unique setting . This must persuade her . His father , great King John of Poland , took it from the Grand Vizier 's tent when the Turks were routed at Vienna . "
34602	34605	34607	34607	he	158	" Sure , "
34609	34678	34607	34607	he	158	" it is a pretty sort of toy . It would persuade any woman to anything so long as she was promised it to hang about her neck . You must promise it to the Princess , but not give it to her — no , lest when she has got it she should be content to remain in Innspruck . I know . You must promise it . "
34693	34702	34704	34704	he	109	" I will not forget to promise it , "
34706	34713	34715	34715	Gaydon	142	" But here 's another point , "
34717	34750	34715	34715	Gaydon	142	" Her Highness , the Princess 's mother , insists that a woman shall attend upon her daughter , and where shall we find a woman with the courage and the strength ? "
34751	34758	34760	34760	Wogan	109	" I have thought of that , "
34762	34783	34760	34760	Wogan	109	" Misset has a wife . By the luckiest stroke in the world Misset took a wife this last spring . "
34896	34925	34892	34892	he	158	" My boy would only live to serve his King . Why should he not serve his King before he lives ? My wife will say the like . "
35043	35114	35034	35034	O'Toole	158	" It is a strange thing that there never was a father since Adam who was not absolutely sure in his heart that his first - born must be a boy . When you come to think philosophically about it , you 'll see that if fathers had their way the world would be peopled with sons with never a bit of a lass in any corner to marry them . "
35163	35170	35172	35172	he	109	" That was a great saying , "
35174	35185	35172	35172	he	109	" but so much sacrifice is not to be accepted . "
35260	35271	35273	35273	Misset	143	" So you may take it that matter 's settled , "
35275	35283	35273	35273	Misset	143	" There will be five of us . "
35284	35287	35289	35289	Wogan	109	" Six , "
35291	35302	35304	35304	Gaydon	142	" There 's another man to join us , then , "
35306	35316	35304	35304	Gaydon	142	" I have it . Your servant , Marnier . "
35317	35484	35273	35273	Misset	143	" No , not Marnier , nor any man . Listen . It is necessary that when once her Highness is rescued we must get so much start as will make pursuit vain . We shall be hampered with a coach , and a coach will travel slowly on the passes of Tyrol . The pursuers will ride horses ; they must not come up with us . From Innspruck to Italy , if we have never an accident , will take us at the least four days ; it will take our pursuers three . We must have one clear day before her Highness 's evasion is discovered . Now , the chief magistrate of Innspruck visits her Highness 's apartments twice a day,—at ten in the morning and at ten of the night . The Princess must be rescued at night ; and if her escape is discovered in the morning she will never reach Italy , she will be behind the bars again . "
35485	35495	35497	35497	Gaydon	142	" But the Princess 's mother will be left , "
35499	35509	35497	35497	Gaydon	142	" She can plead that her daughter is ill . "
35510	35590	35591	35591	Gaydon	142	" The magistrate forces his way into the very bedroom . We must take with us a woman who will lie in her Highness 's bed with the curtains drawn about her and a voice so weak with suffering that she can not raise it above a whisper , with eyes so tired from sleeplessness she can not bear a light near them . Help me in this . Name me a woman with the fortitude to stay behind . "
35596	35632	35593	35593	his	142	" She will certainly be discovered . The part she plays in the escape must certainly be known . She will remain for the captors to punish as they will . I know no woman . "
35633	35636	35638	35638	Wogan	109	" Nay , "
35640	35679	35682	35682	he	109	" you exaggerate her danger . Once the escape is brought to an issue , once her Highness is in Bologna safe , the Emperor can not wreak vengeance on a woman ; it would be too paltry . "
35689	35695	35696	35696	Misset	143	" No , my friend , "
35699	35708	35696	35696	Misset	143	" I know no woman with the fortitude . "
35709	35714	35716	35716	O'Toole	158	" But you do , "
35718	35737	35716	35716	O'Toole	158	" So do I. There 's no difficulty whatever in the matter . Mrs. Misset has a maid . "
35738	35741	35743	35743	Gaydon	142	" Oho ! "
35745	35753	35743	35743	Gaydon	142	" The maid 's name is Jenny . "
35754	35757	35759	35759	Wogan	109	" Aha ! "
35761	35771	35759	35759	Wogan	109	" She 's a very good friend of mine . "
35772	35775	35777	35777	Misset	143	" O'Toole ! "
35781	35794	35777	35777	Misset	143	" My wife 's maid — a very good friend of yours ? "
35795	35807	35809	35809	O'Toole	158	" Sure she is , and you did n't know it , "
35815	35836	35809	35809	O'Toole	158	" I am the cunning man , after all . She would do a great deal for me would Jenny . "
35837	35843	35845	35845	Wogan	109	" But has she courage ? "
35847	35887	35845	35845	Wogan	109	" Faith , her father was a French grenadier and her mother a vivandière . It would be a queer thing if she was frightened by a little matter of lying in bed and pretending to be someone else . "
35888	35898	35900	35900	Gaydon	142	" But can we trust her with the secret ? "
35902	35905	35907	35907	Misset	143	" No ! "
35917	35939	35910	35910	he	109	" My wife 's maid — O'Toole — O'Toole — my wife 's maid . Did ever one hear the like ? "
35940	35944	35946	35946	O'Toole	158	" My friend , "
35950	35971	35946	35946	O'Toole	158	" it seems almost as if you wished to reflect upon Jenny 's character , which would not be right . "
35989	36019	35986	35986	he	109	" Well , at all events , she gossips . We can not take her . She would tell the whole truth of our journey at the first halt . "
36020	36025	36027	36027	O'Toole	158	" That 's true , "
36039	36045	36036	36036	he	109	" I have an idea . "
36046	36049	35986	35986	he	109	" Well ? "
36050	36136	35986	35986	he	109	" We 'll not tell her the truth at all . I doubt if she would come if we told it her . Jenny very likely has never heard of her Highness the Princess , and I doubt if she cares a button for the King . Besides , she would never believe but that we were telling her a lie . No . We 'll make up a probable likely sort of story , and then she 'll believe it to be the truth . "
36137	36142	36144	36144	Wogan	109	" I have it , "
36146	36185	36144	36144	Wogan	109	" We 'll tell her that we are going to abduct an heiress who is dying for love of O'Toole , and whose merciless parents are forcing her into a loveless , despicable marriage with a tottering pantaloon . "
36198	36205	36206	36206	he	158	" There 's the very story , "
36209	36284	36206	36206	he	158	" To be sure , you are a great man , Charles . The most probable convincing story that was ever invented ! Oh ! but you 'll hear Jenny sob with pity for the heiress and Lucius O'Toole when she hears it . It will be a bad day , too , for the merciless parents when they discover Jenny in her Highness 's bed . She stands six feet in her stockings . "
36285	36289	36291	36291	Wogan	109	" Six feet ! "
36293	36298	36291	36291	Wogan	109	" In her stockings , "
36302	36320	36291	36291	Wogan	109	" Her height is her one vanity . Therefore in her shoes she is six feet four . "
36321	36339	36206	36206	he	158	" Well , she must take her heels off and make herself as short as she can . "
36340	36355	36357	36357	O'Toole	158	" You will have trouble , my friend , to persuade her to that , "
36359	36362	36364	36364	Gaydon	142	" Hush ! "
36411	36422	36424	36424	Wogan	109	" I will sleep the night here if I may , "
36434	36445	36424	36424	Wogan	109	" A blanket and a chair will serve my turn . "
36460	36479	36481	36481	Gaydon	142	" We have slept in the one room and lived together since your message came four days ago , "
36483	36508	36481	36481	Gaydon	142	" Take your choice of the beds , for there 's not one of us has so much need of a bed as you . "
36517	36529	36530	36530	he	109	" Oh ! but it 's good to be with you , "
36541	36554	36530	36530	he	109	" I shall sleep to - night . How I shall sleep ! "
36613	36624	36626	36626	Wogan	109	" But I have wanted you these last three days ! "
36628	36650	36626	36626	Wogan	109	" To - morrow when I tell you the story of them you will know how much I have wanted you . "
36714	36717	36719	36719	he	109	" Quick , "
36721	36743	36719	36719	he	109	" the hand at my throat ! It 's not the letter so much , it 's my life they want . "
36744	36751	36753	36753	Gaydon	142	" It 's your own hand , "
38074	38080	38081	38081	Gaydon	142	" It is Major Gaydon . "
38094	38101	38091	38091	He	142	" Mr. Whittington , I think . "
38102	38105	38107	38107	Whittington	111	" Sir , "
38111	38170	38107	38107	Whittington	111	" I am honoured by your memory . For myself , I never forget a face though I see it but for a moment between the light and the dark , but I do not expect the like from my acquaintances . We did meet , I believe , in Paris ? You are of Dillon 's regiment ? "
38171	38178	38180	38180	Gaydon	142	" And on leave in Rome , "
38186	38190	38192	38192	Whittington	111	" On leave ? "
38196	38280	38192	38192	Whittington	111	" Well , so far as towns go , Rome is as good as another , though , to tell the truth , I find them all quite unendurable . Would I were on leave ! but I am pinned here , a watchman with a lantern . I do but lack a rattle , though , to be sure , I could not spring it . We are secret to - night , major . Do you know what house this is ? "
38281	38284	38286	38286	Gaydon	142	" No , "
38288	38302	38286	38286	Gaydon	142	" But I am waited for and will bid you good - night . "
38364	38477	38357	38357	He	111	" Well , it is the house of Maria Vittoria , Mademoiselle de Caprara , the heiress of Bologna , who has only this evening come to Rome . And so no later than this evening I am playing link - boy , appointed by letters patent , one might say . But what will you ? Youth is youth , whether in a ploughboy or a — But my tongue needs a gag . Another word , and I had said too much . Well , since you will be going , good - night . We shall meet , no doubt , in a certain house that overlooks the Tiber . "
38478	38481	38483	38483	Gaydon	142	" Hardly , "
38485	38494	38483	38483	Gaydon	142	" since I leave Rome to - morrow . "
38495	38505	38507	38507	Whittington	111	" Indeed ? You leave Rome to - morrow ? "
38509	38517	38519	38519	he	111	" I would I were as fortunate , "
38911	38914	38915	38915	he	348	" Maria ! "
38943	38963	38937	38937	she	164	" His Holiness the Pope had consented to our marriage . What would I not have done for you ? "
38981	38984	38964	38965	The Chevalier	348	" Maria ! "
38985	39030	39042	39042	his	348	" Would that I were poor ! Would that I were powerless ! But I am rich — so rich . I could have done so much . I am alone — so much alone . What would I not have done for you ? "
39031	39034	39035	39035	His	348	" Maria ! "
39094	39100	39101	39101	she	164	" But you love me , "
39105	39164	39101	39101	she	164	" Tell me so ! Say , ' I love you , I love you , I love you . ' Oh that we both could die , you saying it , I hearing it,—die to - night , like this , my arm about you , your face against my heart ! My lord , my lord ! "
39180	39236	39167	39167	she	164	" Say it with your eyes on mine ! I can see though the tears fall . I shall never hear the words again after to - night . Do not stint me of them ; let them flow just as these tears flow . They will leave no more trace than do my tears . "
39237	39244	39246	39247	the Chevalier	348	" Maria , I love you , "
39249	39256	39246	39247	the Chevalier	348	" How I do love you ! "
39297	39320	39292	39292	she	164	" Say that you have no room in your thoughts except for me . Say that you have no scrap of love — "
39335	39357	39329	39329	she	164	" No , no ! Say that you have no scrap of love to toss to the woman there in Innspruck ! "
39358	39361	39362	39362	he	1356	" Maria ! "
39365	39368	39370	39370	she	164	" Hush ! "
39377	39419	39370	39370	she	164	" To - morrow you shall love her ; to - morrow I will not ask your eyes to dwell on mine or your hand to quiver as it touches mine . But to - night love no one but me . "
39500	39508	39509	39509	she	164	" Shall I tell you my thought ? "
39512	39521	39509	39509	she	164	" Shall I dare to tell you it ? "
39522	39527	39484	39484	she	164	" Tell it me ! "
39528	39559	39509	39509	she	164	" God has died to - night . Hush ! Do not move ! Do not speak ! Perhaps the world will slip and crumble if we but stay still . "
39629	39635	39636	39636	he	114	" But we are children , "
39642	39705	39636	39636	he	114	" Is it not strange the very pain which tortures us because we are man and woman should sink us into children ? We sit hoping that a miracle will split the world in pieces ! This is the Caprara Palace ; Whittington drowses outside over his lantern ; and to - morrow Gaydon rides with his passport northwards to Charles Wogan . "
39725	39734	39716	39716	She	164	" I hate him ! I hate him ! "
39735	39743	39716	39716	She	164	" Yet I have no better servant ! "
39744	39761	39716	39716	She	164	" Speak no good word of him in my ears ! He robs me of you . "
39762	39770	39716	39716	She	164	" He risks his life for me . "
39771	39781	39716	39716	She	164	" I will pray that he may lose it . "
39782	39785	39786	39787	The Chevalier	114	" Maria ! "
39801	39806	39807	39807	she	164	" I do pray , "
39810	39836	39807	39807	she	164	" Every fibre in me tingles with the prayer . Oh , I hate him ! Why did you give him leave to rescue her ? "
39837	39907	39911	39912	Maria Vittoria	164	" Could I refuse ? I did delay him ; I did hesitate . Only to - day Gaydon receives the passport , and even so I have delayed too long . Indeed , Maria , I dare not think of the shame , the danger , her Highness has endured for me , lest my presence here , even for this farewell , should too bitterly reproach me . "
40011	40190	40004	40004	she	164	" You told me business would call you to Spain . Go there ! Stay there ! For a little — oh , not for long ! But for a month , say , after your Princess comes triumphing into Bologna . Promise me that ! I could not bear that you should meet her as she comes . There would be shouts ; I can hear them . No , I will not have it ! I can see her proud cursed face a - flush . No ! You think too much of what she has suffered . If I could have suffered too ! But suffering , shame , humiliation , these fall to women , always have fallen . We have learnt to bear them so that we feel them less than you . My dear lord , believe me ! Her suffering is no great thing . If we love we welcome it ! Each throb of pain endured for love becomes a thrill of joy . If I could have suffered too ! "
40282	40285	40287	40287	he	114	" Sweetheart , "
40289	40331	40287	40287	he	114	" I would have no woman suffer a pang for me had I my will of the world . But since that may not be , I do not believe that any woman could be deeper hurt than you are now . "
40332	40336	40347	40347	Her	164	" Not Clementina ? "
40337	40340	40341	40341	Maria	164	" No . "
40362	40370	40371	40371	she	1362	" Nor can she love as deep , "
40375	40399	40371	40371	she	1362	" A Sobieski from the snows ! Love was born here in Italy . She robs me of you . I hate her . "
40407	40413	40401	40401	she	1362	" Charles Wogan may fail . "
40414	40421	40371	40371	she	1362	" You do not know him . "
40422	40433	40371	40371	she	1362	" The cleverest have made mistakes and died for them . "
40434	40488	40401	40401	she	1362	" Wogan makes mistakes like another , but somehow gets the better of them in the end . There was a word he said to me when he begged for my permission . I told him his plan was a mere dream . He answered he would dream it true ; he will . "
40489	40510	40371	40371	she	1362	" You should have waked him . You were the master , he the servant . You were the King . "
40511	40548	40371	40371	she	1362	" And when can the King do what he wills instead of what he must ? Maria , if you and I had met before I sent Charles Wogan to search out a wife for me — "
40559	40567	40554	40554	She	164	" He chose her as your wife ? "
40568	40580	40371	40371	she	1362	" If only I had had time to summon him back ! "
40581	40594	40371	40371	she	1362	" He chose her — Charles Wogan . How I hate him ! "
40595	40604	40371	40371	she	1362	" I sent him to make the choice . "
40605	40637	40371	40371	she	1362	" And he might have gone no step beyond Bologna . There was I not a mile distant ready to his hand ! But I was too mean , too despicable — "
40638	40643	40650	40650	he	1364	" Maria , hush ! "
40666	40782	40784	40784	she	1366	" My lord , I hurt you , so you see how I am proven mean . Give me your hand and laugh to me ; laugh with your heart and eyes and lips . I am jealous of your pain . I am a woman . I would have it all , gather it all into my bosom , and cherish each sharp stab like a flower my lover gives to me . I am glad of them . They are flowers that will not wither . Add a kiss , sweetheart , the sharpest stab , and so the chief flower , the very rose of flowers . There , that is well , "
40820	40826	40828	40829	the Chevalier	348	" Would we were free ! "
40831	40877	40878	40878	She	1366	" But since we are not , let us show brave faces to the world and hide our hearts . I do wish you all happiness . But you will go to Spain . There 's a friend 's hand in warrant of the wish . "
40894	40902	40904	40904	she	1366	" Good - night , my friend , "
40906	40941	40904	40904	she	1366	" Speak those same words to me , and no word more . I am tired with the day 's doings . I have need of sleep , oh , great need of it ! "
40978	40986	40988	40988	he	348	" Good - night , my friend , "
41179	41190	41191	41191	he	111	" I have kept you here a wearisome long time , "
41210	41225	41227	41227	Whittington	111	" I had some talk with Major Gaydon which helped me to beguile it , "
41229	41232	41234	41235	the Chevalier	114	" Gaydon ! "
41237	41242	41234	41235	the Chevalier	114	" are you certain ? "
41243	41253	41255	41255	Whittington	111	" A man may make mistakes in the darkness , "
41257	41262	41255	41255	Whittington	111	" To be sure . "
41263	41273	41234	41235	the Chevalier	114	" And I never had an eye for faces . "
41274	41282	41284	41285	the Chevalier	114	" It was not Gaydon , then ? "
41287	41294	41296	41296	Whittington	111	" It may not have been , "
41298	41316	41296	41296	Whittington	111	" and by the best of good fortune I said nothing to him of any significance whatever . "
41434	41442	41444	41444	he	121	" The King will receive you now , "
41446	41451	41444	41444	he	121	" Let us go . "
41452	41463	41424	41425	the Chevalier	348	" It is broad daylight . We shall be seen . "
41464	41472	41474	41474	Edgar	121	" Not if the street is empty , "
41528	41532	41534	41534	Edgar	121	" Follow me , "
41772	41785	41787	41787	he	121	" You will breathe no word of this passage , Major Gaydon , "
41789	41846	41787	41787	he	121	" The house was built a century ago when Rome was more troubled than it is to - day , but the passage was never more useful than now . Men from England , whose names it would astonish you to know , have trodden these steps on a secret visit to the King . Ah ! "
42181	42188	42176	42176	he	142	" Will he tell Charles Wogan ? "
42249	42260	42262	42262	Gaydon	142	" The King was not in the best of spirits , "
42264	42268	42270	42270	Wogan	126	" With this , "
42276	42286	42270	42270	Wogan	126	" we 'll find a means to hearten him . "
42295	42303	42304	42304	he	142	" Will you tell me , Wogan , "
42305	42331	42270	42270	Wogan	126	asked,—"I am by nature curious,—was it the King who proposed this enterprise to you , or was it you who proposed it to the King ? "
42347	42353	42354	42354	he	126	" What do you mean ? "
42413	42416	42418	42418	he	126	" Faith , "
42420	42498	42418	42418	he	126	" it is a question to perplex a man . I misdoubt but we both had the thought about the same time . ' Wogan , ' said he , ' there 's the Princess with a chain on her leg , so to speak , ' and I answered him , ' A chain 's a galling sort of thing to a lady 's ankle . ' There was little more said if I remember right . "
42613	42619	42621	42621	he	126	" You have bad news , "
42623	42629	42631	42631	Gaydon	142	" There was never worse , "
42662	42724	42652	42652	he	142	" I went to my brother major to report my return . He was entertaining his friends . He had a letter this morning from Strasbourg and he read it aloud . The letter said a rumour was running through the town that the Chevalier Wogan had already rescued the Princess and was being hotly pursued on the road to Trent . "
42745	42755	42757	42757	he	167	" I expected rumour would be busy with us , "
42759	42771	42757	42757	he	167	" but never that it would take so favourable a shape . "
42772	42775	42777	42777	Gaydon	142	" Favourable ! "
42779	42909	42777	42777	Gaydon	142	" To be sure , for its falsity will be established to - morrow , and ridicule cast upon those who spread and believed it . False alarms are the proper strategy to conceal the real assault . The rumour does us a service . Our secret is very well kept , for here am I in Schlestadt , and people living in Schlestadt believe me on the road to Trent . I will go back with you to the major 's and have a laugh at his correspondent . Courage , my friend . We will give our enemies a month . Let them cry wolf as often as they will during that month , we 'll get into the fold all the more easily in the end . "
42951	42962	42964	42964	Wogan	167	" Here 's another who has heard the same rumour , "
42966	42974	42976	42976	Misset	143	" It is more than a rumour , "
42978	43034	43035	43035	He	167	" It is an order , and most peremptory , from the Court of France , forbidding any officer of Dillon 's regiment to be absent for more than twenty - four hours from his duties on pain of being broke . Our secret 's out . That 's the plain truth of the matter . "
43124	43132	43134	43134	Wogan	167	" We will give them a month , "
43151	43240	43134	43134	Wogan	167	" No doubt we are suspected . I never had a hope that we should not be . The Court of France , you see , can do no less than forbid us , but I should not be surprised if it winks at us on the sly . We will give them a month . Colonel Lally is a friend of mine and a friend of the King . We will get an abatement of that order , so that not one of you shall be cashiered . "
43241	43249	43251	43251	Misset	143	" I do n't flinch at that , "
43253	43260	43251	43251	Misset	143	" but the secret 's out . "
43261	43270	43272	43272	Wogan	167	" Then we must use the more precautions , "
43318	43328	43330	43330	he	167	" A strange , imperturbable man is Charles Wogan , "
43339	43359	43330	43330	he	167	" Did you happen by any chance to cast your eye over the paper I had my hand on ? "
43360	43365	43367	43367	Gaydon	142	" I did not , "
43374	43384	43367	43367	Gaydon	142	" It was a private letter , no doubt . "
43385	43442	43443	43443	Gaydon	142	" It was poetry . There 's no need for you to hurry , my friend . It was more than mere poetry , it was in Latin . I read the first line on the page , and it ran , ' Te , dum spernit , arat novus accola ; max ubi cultam — ' "
43451	43460	43461	43461	he	142	" I 'll hear no more of it , "
43464	43472	43461	43461	he	142	" Poetry is none of my business . "
43473	43482	43484	43484	O'Toole	158	" There , Dick , you are wrong , "
43547	43555	43557	43557	he	158	" Yes , I 've done it , "
43559	43672	43557	43557	he	158	" I 've written poetry . It is a thing a polite gentleman should be able to do . So I did it . It was n't in Latin , because the young lady it was written to did n't understand Latin . Her name was Lucy , and I rhymed her to ' juicy , ' and the pleasure of it made her purple in the face . There were to have been four lines , but there were never more than three and a half because I could not think of a suitable rhyme to O'Toole . Lucy said she knew one , but she would never tell it me . "
43934	43944	43945	43945	he	126	" I do not know but what her Highness , "
43948	44002	43945	43945	he	126	" will receive the best consolation for her sufferings on my account if she accepts so favourable a proposal , rather than run so many hazards as she must needs do as my wife . For myself , I have been summoned most urgently into Spain and am travelling thither on the instant . "
44078	44088	44090	44090	he	126	" It is very well I have this letter , "
44092	44126	44090	44090	he	126	" for until it came I had no scrap of writing whatever to show either to her Highness or , what I take to be more important , to her Highness 's mother , "
44444	44448	44449	44449	she	161	" To me , "
44453	44513	44449	44449	she	161	" there 's nothing sinful in changing clothes with the beautiful mistress of O'Toole . Christian charity says we are to make others happy . I am a Christian , and as to the uncle he can go to the devil ! He can do nothing to me but talk , and I do n't understand his stupid language . "
44893	44898	44899	44899	she	116	" He has come ! "
44950	44969	44940	44940	She	116	" You were stopped in your walk . You have a message for me . He has come ! "
44983	44991	44993	44993	he	125	" I was stopped in my walk , "
44995	45011	44993	44993	he	125	" but not by the Chevalier Wogan . Who it was I do not know . "
45012	45018	45020	45020	Clementina	116	" Can you not guess ? "
45022	45030	45032	45033	her mother	3108	" I would not trust a stranger , "
45035	45040	45042	45042	Clementina	116	" Would you not ? "
45048	45054	45042	45042	Clementina	116	" Describe him to me . "
45055	45061	45063	45063	Chateaudoux	125	" His face was wrinkled , "
45065	45070	45063	45063	Chateaudoux	125	" It was disguised . "
45071	45082	45083	45084	M. Chateaudoux	125	" His figure was slight and not over - tall . "
45093	45103	45105	45106	the mother	569	" I know no one whom the portrait fits , "
45114	45147	45148	45148	She	116	" Can you not guess ? Then , mother , I will punish you . For though I know — in very truth , I know — I will not tell you . "
45154	45176	45148	45148	She	116	" Well , his message ? He did fix a time , a day , an hour , for my escape ? "
45177	45192	45148	45148	She	116	" The 27th is the day , and at eight o'clock of the night . "
45193	45199	45148	45148	She	116	" I will be ready . "
45200	45223	45148	45148	She	116	" He will come here to fetch your Highness . Meanwhile he prays your Highness to fall sick and keep your bed . "
45224	45231	45233	45233	Clementina	116	" I can choose my malady , "
45235	45259	45233	45233	Clementina	116	" It will not all be counterfeit , for indeed I shall fall sick of joy . But why must I fall sick ? "
45260	45286	45148	45148	She	116	" He brings a woman to take your place , who , lying in bed with the curtains drawn , will the later be discovered . "
45304	45320	45299	45299	she	3112	" How will the woman enter ? How , too , will my daughter leave ? "
45366	45376	45377	45377	she	3107	" Her name is Friederika , I 'll warrant , "
45380	45421	45377	45377	she	3107	" My poor Chateaudoux , they will give you a sweetheart . It is most cruel . Well , Friederika , thanks to the sentry 's fellow - feeling for a burning heart , Friederika slips in at the door . "
45422	45443	45466	45467	her mother	3108	" Which I have taken care should stand unlatched . She changes clothes with your Highness , and your Highness — "
45444	45451	45377	45377	she	3107	" Slips out in her stead . "
45452	45464	45466	45467	her mother	3108	" But he is to come for you , he says , "
45469	45504	45466	45467	her mother	3108	" And how will he do that ? Besides , we do not know his name . And there must be a fitting companion who will travel with you . Has he that companion ? "
45505	45509	45511	45511	Chateaudoux	125	" Your Highness , "
45513	45540	45511	45511	Chateaudoux	125	" upon all those points he bade me say you should be satisfied . All he asks is that you will be ready at the time . "
45561	45567	45569	45569	she	3108	" The Prince of Baden , "
45580	45584	45586	45586	Chateaudoux	125	" A Prince , "
45590	45598	45586	45586	Chateaudoux	125	" with much territory to his princeliness . "
45599	45608	45610	45610	Clementina	116	" A vain , fat , pudgy man , "
45612	45619	45621	45622	the mother	569	" A sober , honest gentleman , "
45624	45633	45635	45635	Clementina	116	" A sober butler to an honest gentleman , "
45637	45643	45645	45645	Chateaudoux	125	" He has an air , "
45647	45652	45654	45654	Clementina	116	" He has indeed , "
45656	45709	45710	45710	She	116	" as though he handed himself upon a plate to you , and said , ' Here is a miracle . Thank God for it ! ' Well , I must take to my bed . I am very ill . I have a fever on me , and that 's truth . "
45742	45750	45752	45752	he	125	" It is the Prince 's carriage , "
45754	45761	45763	45763	Clementina	116	" I will not see him , "
45765	45772	45774	45775	her mother	3108	" My child , you must , "
45777	45785	45774	45775	her mother	3108	" if only for the last time . "
45786	45856	45857	45858	The Princess	3107	" Each time he comes it is for the last time , yet the next day sees him still in Innspruck . My patience and my courtesy are both outworn . Besides , to - day , now that I have heard this great news we have waited for — how long ? Oh , mother , oh , mother , I can not ! I shall betray myself . "
45865	45890	45891	45891	she	3112	" Clementina , you must receive him . I will have it so . I am your mother . I will be your mother , "
45937	45981	45919	45919	She	116	" So you shall . I would not barter mothers with any girl in Christendom . But you understand . I am pledged in honour to my King . I will receive the Prince , but indeed I would he had not come , "
46111	46114	46115	46115	he	174	" Madam , "
46122	46154	46115	46115	he	174	" I think to have given you some proof of my devotion . Even on this inclement day I come to pay my duty though the streets are deep in snow . "
46155	46160	46162	46162	Clementina	116	" Oh , sir , "
46164	46198	46115	46115	he	174	" then your feet are wet . Never run such risks for me . I would have no man weep on my account though it were only from a cold in the head . "
46216	46223	46225	46225	he	174	" Madam , have no fears , "
46239	46247	46225	46225	he	174	" I drove here in my carriage . "
46248	46259	46199	46200	The Prince	588	" But from the carriage to the door you walked ? "
46260	46269	46270	46270	Clementina	116	" No , madam , I was carried . "
46276	46288	46289	46289	she	116	" I would have given much to have seen you carried , "
46293	46329	46289	46289	she	116	" I suppose you would not repeat the — No , it would be to ask too much . Besides , from my windows here in the side of the house I could not see . "
46344	46364	46335	46337	The fatuous gentleman	1487	" Madam , you have but to say the word and your windows shall look whichever way you will . "
46392	46431	46380	46381	The Prince	588	" I have stayed a long while in Innspruck , setting my constancy , which bade me stay , above my dignity , which bade me go . For three months I have stayed,—a long while , madam . "
46432	46444	46446	46446	Clementina	116	" I do not think three years could have been longer , "
46453	46468	46446	46446	Clementina	116	" So now in the end I have called my pride to help me . "
46469	46480	46482	46482	Clementina	116	" The noblest gift that heaven has given a man , "
46495	46503	46505	46505	he	588	" Will you give me your hand , "
46507	46514	46505	46505	he	588	" as far as your window ? "
46515	46525	46526	46526	Clementina	116	" Certainly , sir , and out of it . "
46547	46599	46540	46540	Clementina	116	" What do you see ? A sentinel fixed there guarding you . At the door stands a second sentinel . Answer me as I would be answered , your window and your door are free . Refuse me , and I travel into Italy . My trunks are already packed . "
46600	46607	46609	46609	Clementina	116	" Neatly packed , I hope , "
46636	46644	46646	46646	she	116	" Will you give me your hand , "
46648	46655	46646	46646	she	116	" as far as my table ? "
46677	46686	46688	46688	she	116	" What do you see upon my table ? "
46698	46702	46704	46704	he	588	" A picture , "
46708	46711	46704	46704	he	588	" Whose ? "
46712	46717	46718	46718	he	588	" The Pretender 's , "
46724	46729	46731	46731	she	116	" The King 's , "
46735	46761	46731	46731	she	116	" His picture is fixed there guarding me . Against my heart there lies a second . I wish your Highness all speed to Italy . "
46786	46803	46779	46780	The Prince	588	" You refuse a dowry of £ 100,000 . I would have you think of that . "
46804	46816	46817	46818	The Prince	588	" Sir , you think of it for both of us . "
46827	46835	46820	46820	himself	588	" I have your answer , then ? "
46836	46856	46779	46780	The Prince	588	" You have , sir . You had it yesterday , and if I remember right the day before . "
46857	46898	46820	46820	himself	588	" I will stay yet two more days . Madam , you need not fear . I shall not importune you . I give you those two days for reflection . Unless I hear from you I shall leave Innspruck — "
46899	46906	46909	46909	Clementina	116	" In two days ' time ? "
46911	46919	46921	46922	the Prince	588	" On the evening of the 27th , "
47799	47804	47808	47812	the Chevalier de St. George	114	" The White Chamois , "
47879	47882	47883	47883	he	365	" Rudolf , "
47891	47906	47883	47883	he	365	" come with me ! Our birds will not fly away to - night . "
47926	47931	47933	47933	Rudolf	178	" What a night ! "
47935	47947	47933	47933	Rudolf	178	" Not a citizen would thrust his nose out of doors . "
47948	47957	47959	47960	the other	260	" Not even the little Chateaudoux 's sweetheart , "
47986	47996	47998	47998	Rudolf	178	" There is an hour before the magistrate comes , "
48000	48006	48008	48009	his companion	649	" You take that hour , "
48011	48023	48008	48009	his companion	649	" I will have the hour after the magistrate has gone . "
48196	48203	48204	48204	she	308	" You may talk all night , "
48210	48264	48204	48204	she	308	" about O'Toole and his beautiful German . They can go hang for me ! I am only a servant , I know . I am poor , I admit it . But poverty is n't a crime . It gives no one the right to make a dwarf of me . No , no!"—this
48274	48315	48266	48266	Wogan	126	ground—"plague on you all ! I will sit here and die ; and when I am found frozen and dead perhaps you will be sorry for your cruelty to a poor girl who wanted nothing better than to serve you . "
48439	48590	48591	48591	Wogan	126	" I am not beautiful , I know ; I never boasted that I was ; but I have a figure and limbs that a painter would die to paint . And what do you make of me ? A maggot , a thing all body like a nasty bear . Oh , curse the day that I set out with such tyrants ! A pretty figure of fun I should make before your beautiful German , covered with mud to the knees . No , you shall hang me first ! Why could n't O'Toole do his own work , the ninny , I hate him ! He 's tall enough , the great donkey ; but no , I must do it , who am shorter , and even then not short enough for him and you , but you must drag me through the dirt without heels ! "
48953	48964	48966	48966	he	126	" You are in the right of it , Jenny , "
48978	48981	48982	48982	he	126	" Yes , "
48985	49089	48982	48982	he	126	" I was in the wrong . O'Toole is the most selfish man in the whole world . Cowardly , too ! But there never was a selfish man who was not at heart a bit of a coward . Sure enough , sooner or later the cowardice comes out . It is a preposterous thing that O'Toole should think that you and I are going to rescue his heiress for him while he sits at his ease by the inn fire . No ; let us go back to him and tell him to his face the selfish cowardly man he is . "
49129	49140	49122	49122	she	161	" I would not say that he was a coward . "
49141	49146	49148	49148	Wogan	109	" But I would , "
49152	49182	49148	49148	Wogan	109	" Moreover , I do . With all my heart I say it . A great lubberly monster of a coward . He is envious , too , Jenny . "
49191	49195	49196	49196	she	161	" Why envious ? "
49212	49264	49196	49196	she	161	" It 's as plain as the palm of my hand . Why should he make a dwarf of you , Jenny?—for it 's the truth he has done that ; he has made a little dwarf out of the finest girl in the land by robbing her of her heels . "
49284	49288	49289	49289	he	109	" A dwarf , "
49292	49409	49289	49289	he	109	" it was your own word , Jenny . I could say nothing to comfort you when you spoke it , for it was so true and suitable an epithet . A little dwarf he has made of you , all body and no legs like a bear , a dwarf - bear , of course ; and why , if it is not that he envies you your figure and is jealous of it in a mean and discreditable way ? Sure , he wants to have all the looks and to appear quite incomparable to the eyes of his beautiful German . So he makes a dwarf of you , a little bear dwarf — "
49448	49454	49456	49456	she	161	" He is not envious , "
49458	49510	49512	49512	she	161	" A fine friend he has in you , I am thinking . He has no need to be envious . Captain O'Toole could carry me to the house in his arms if he wished , which is more than you could do if you tried till midday to - morrow , "
49533	49576	49512	49512	she	161	" But he did n't wish . He let you drag through the mud and snow without so much as a patten to keep you off the ground . Why ? Tell me that , Jenny ! Why did n't he wish ? "
49581	49599	49601	49601	Wogan	109	" You see , if he is not envious , he is at all events a coward , "
49603	49618	49601	49601	Wogan	109	" else he would have run his own risks and come in your stead . "
49619	49627	49629	49629	Jenny	161	" But that would not have served , "
49640	49670	49633	49633	her	161	" How could O'Toole have run away with his heiress and at the same time remained behind in her bed to escape suspicion , as I am to do ? "
49671	49681	49683	49683	Wogan	109	" I had forgotten that , to be sure , "
49691	49703	49705	49705	she	161	" O'Toole is the man with the head on his shoulders , "
49707	49717	49719	49719	Wogan	109	" And a pitiful , calculating head it is , "
49721	49792	49719	49719	Wogan	109	" Think of the inconvenience of your position when you are discovered to - morrow . Think of the angry uncle ! O'Toole has thought of him and so keeps out of his way . Here 's a nice world , where hulking , shapeless giants like O'Toole hide themselves from angry uncles behind a dwarf - girl 's petticoats . Bah ! We will go back and kick O'Toole . "
49810	49875	49804	49804	she	161	" You kick O'Toole ! You might once , if he happened to be asleep . But he would take you up by the scruff of the neck and the legs and beat your face against your knees until you were dead . Besides , what do I care for an angry uncle ! I am well paid to put up with his insults . "
49876	49880	49882	49882	Wogan	109	" Well paid ! "
49888	49954	49882	49882	Wogan	109	" A hundred guineas and a damask gown ! Three hundred guineas and a gown all lace and gold tags would not be enough . Besides , I 'll wager he has not paid you a farthing . He 'll cheat you , Jenny . He 's a rare bite is O'Toole . Between you and me , Jenny , he is a beggarly fellow ! "
49955	49963	49965	49965	Jenny	161	" He has already paid me half , "
49984	49987	49989	49989	he	109	" Well , "
49991	50046	49989	49989	he	109	" he has only done it to cheat you the more easily of the other fifty . We will go straight back and tell him that it costs three hundred guineas , money down , and the best gown in Paris to turn a fine figure of a girl into a dwarf - bear . "
50067	50070	50071	50071	she	161	" No , "
50074	50124	50071	50071	she	161	" you can go back if you will and show him what a good friend you are to him . But I go on . The poor captain shall have one person in the world , though she 's only a servant , to help him when he wants . "
50212	50248	50201	50201	He	1605	" Jenny , you will not say a word to O'Toole about the remarks I made of him ? He is a strong , hasty man . I know not what might come of it . "
50276	50280	50201	50201	He	1605	" The White Chamois "
50370	50443	50357	50357	He	109	" Give me a quarter of an hour so far as you can judge . Then pass the sentinel and go up the steps into the house . The sentinel is prepared for your coming , and if he stops you , you must say ' Chateaudoux ' in a whisper , and he will understand . You will find the door of the house open and a man waiting for you . "
50538	50543	50520	50521	that sentry	1618	" The White Chamois . "
51095	51106	51107	51107	he	109	" It was the Princess - mother who cried out , "
51324	51329	51330	51330	she	1637	" Heaven have mercy ! "
51333	51342	51330	51330	she	1637	" shut the window ! Shut it fast ! "
51358	51377	51350	51350	she	116	" No , do not leave me ! Come away ! Jesu ! here are we alone,—two women ! "
51378	51381	51383	51383	Clementina	116	" Mother , "
51407	51415	51395	51395	she	116	" there 's no cause for fear . "
51416	51436	51439	51439	her	116	" No cause for fear ! I saw him — the sentry — he is climbing up . Ah ! "
51456	51473	51475	51475	Clementina	116	" Hush , mother ! A cry will ruin us . It 's not the sentinel , "
51495	51502	51503	51503	she	116	" Who is it , then ? "
51506	51512	51514	51514	Clementina	116	" Can you not guess ? "
51518	51545	51514	51514	Clementina	116	" It is so evident . Yet I would not have you guess . It is my secret , my discovery . I 'll tell you . "
51575	51596	51564	51564	her	1637	" Your sentinel is the one man who has the right to rescue me . Your sentinel 's the King . "
51606	51612	51614	51614	he	109	" No , your Highness , "
51616	51623	51614	51614	he	109	" but the King 's servant . "
51722	51726	51727	51727	she	1637	" Mr. Wogan , "
51730	51737	51727	51727	she	1637	" the King is well served ; "
51857	51910	51846	51846	He	109	" Your Highness , the truth is there are great matters brewing in Spain . His Majesty was needed there most urgently . He had to decide between Innspruck and Cadiz , and it seemed that he would honour your great confidence in him and at the same time serve you best — "
51931	51957	51926	51926	she	116	" You are right , Mr. Wogan . The King is right . Mine was a girl 's thought . I am ashamed of it ; "
52025	52028	52030	52030	she	116	" No , "
52032	52054	52030	52030	she	116	" an honest handclasp , if you please ; for no woman can have ever lived who had a truer friend , "
52155	52172	52143	52146	the Princess - mother	1637	" Mr. Wogan , you were to bring a written authority from the Prince my husband . "
52179	52183	52185	52185	he	109	" Your Highness , "
52195	52203	52185	52185	he	109	" I was given such an authority . "
52213	52220	52210	52210	her	1637	" Will you give it me ? "
52221	52355	52356	52356	Clementina	116	" I said that I was given such an authority . But I have it no longer . I was attacked on my way from Ohlau . There were five men against me , all of whom desired that letter . The room was small ; I could not run away ; neither had I much space wherein to resist five men . I knew that were I killed and that letter found on me , your Highness would thereafter be too surely guarded to make escape possible , and his Highness Prince Sobieski would himself incur the Emperor 's hostility . So when I had made sure that those five men were joined against me , I twisted that letter into a taper and before their faces lit my pipe with it . "
52419	52464	52409	52409	she	1637	" We do not doubt you , Mr. Wogan , but that written letter , giving my daughter leave to go , I needs must have before I let her go . A father 's authority ! I can not take that upon myself . "
52477	52483	52484	52484	she	116	" You did not hear , "
52487	52499	52484	52484	she	116	" I heard indeed that Mr. Wogan had burnt the letter . "
52500	52555	52556	52559	The Princess - mother	1637	" But under what stress , and to spare my father and to leave me still a grain of hope . Mother , this gentleman has run great risks for me,—how great I did not know ; even now in this one instance we can only guess and still fall short of the mark . "
52566	52583	52584	52584	Clementina	116	" My child , without some sure sign the Prince consents , you must not go . "
52599	52606	52608	52608	he	109	" That sure sign I have , "
52610	52633	52635	52635	he	109	" It is a surer sign than any written letter ; for handwriting may always be counterfeit . This could never be , "
52661	52787	52788	52791	The Princess - mother	1637	" It is a jewel unique in all the world , and the Prince gave it me . It is a jewel he treasured not only for its value , but its history . Yet he gave it me . It was won by the great King John of Poland , and remains as a memorial of the most glorious day in all that warrior 's glorious life ; yet his son gave it me . With his own hands he put it into mine to prove to me with what confidence he trusted your Highness 's daughter to my care . That confidence was written large in the letter I burnt , but I am thinking it is engraved for ever upon this stone . "
52814	52819	52820	52820	she	116	" I am ready , "
52841	52861	52862	52862	Wogan	109	" My jewels are packed in the bundle , but I can leave them behind me if needs be . "
52870	52904	52862	52862	Wogan	109	" Your Highness teaches a lesson to soldiers ; for there is never a knapsack but can hold this and still have half its space to spare . The front door is unlatched ? "
52905	52914	52824	52824	she	116	" M. Chateaudoux is watching in the hall . "
52915	52922	52824	52824	she	116	" And the hall 's unlighted ? "
52923	52926	52824	52824	she	116	" Yes . "
52927	52995	52997	52997	he	1669	" Jenny should be here in a minute , and before she comes I must tell you she does not know the importance of our undertaking . She is the servant to Mrs. Misset , who attends your Highness into Italy . We did not let her into the secret . We made up a comedy in which you have your parts to play . Your Highness , "
53002	53016	52997	52997	he	1669	" is a rich Austrian heiress , deeply enamoured of Captain Lucius O'Toole . "
53017	53022	53024	53025	the mother	569	" Captain Lucius O'Toole ! "
53030	53040	53024	53025	the mother	569	" My daughter enamoured of a Captain Lucius O'Toole ! "
53041	53050	53052	53052	Wogan	109	" He is one of my three companions , "
53056	53073	53052	53052	Wogan	109	" Moreover , he is six foot four , the most creditable lover in the world . "
53074	53077	53079	53079	Clementina	116	" Well , "
53085	53102	53079	53079	Clementina	116	" I am deeply enamoured of the engaging Captain Lucius O'Toole . Go on , sir . "
53103	53147	53052	53052	Wogan	109	" Your parents are of a most unexampled cruelty . They will not smile upon the fascinating O'Toole , but have locked you up on bread and water until you shall agree to marry a wealthy but decrepit gentleman of eighty - three . "
53148	53153	53155	53155	Clementina	116	" I will not , "
53157	53180	53155	53155	Clementina	116	" I will starve myself to death first . I will marry my six feet four or no other man in Christendom . "
53181	53184	53186	53187	her mother	3108	" Clementina ! "
53191	53197	53199	53199	Wogan	109	" But at this moment , "
53201	53218	53199	53199	Wogan	109	" there very properly appears the fairy godmother in the person of a romantical maiden aunt . "
53219	53222	53224	53224	Clementina	116	" Oh ! "
53226	53234	53224	53224	Clementina	116	" I have a romantical maiden aunt . "
53235	53238	53240	53240	Wogan	109	" Yes , "
53253	53257	53248	53251	the Princess - mother	1637	" your Highness . "
53258	53261	53262	53262	she	116	" I ? "
53271	53283	53285	53285	Wogan	109	" Your Highness has written an encouraging letter to Captain O'Toole , "
53293	53300	53287	53290	The Princess - mother	1637	" A letter to Captain O'Toole , "
53314	53367	53302	53302	she	1637	" On the receipt of the letter Captain O'Toole gathers his friends , borrows a horse here , a carriage there , and a hundred guineas from Heaven knows whom , comes to the rescue like a knight - errant , and retells the old story of how love laughs at locksmiths . "
53447	53451	53452	53452	she	569	" Mr. Wogan , "
53469	53555	53452	53452	she	569	" my daughter can not go to - night . To - morrow , if the sky clears , yes , but to - night , no . You do not know , sir , being a man . But my daughter has fasted through this Lent , and that leaves a woman weak . I do forbid her going , as her father would . The very dogs running the streets for food keep kennel on such a night . She must not go . "
53589	53593	53594	53594	he	109	" Your Highness , "
53598	53644	53594	53594	he	109	" we are not birds of passage to rule our flight by seasons . We must take the moment when it comes , and it comes now . To - night your daughter can escape ; for here 's a night made for an escape . "
53645	53651	53653	53653	Clementina	116	" And for my part , "
53655	53663	53664	53664	She	116	" I would the snow fell faster . "
53680	53718	53673	53673	her	116	" Would they did not melt ! I believe Heaven sends the snow to shelter me . It 's the white canopy spread above my head , that I may go in state to meet my King . "
53849	53859	53860	53860	she	1637	" My daughter can not go to - night , "
53864	53870	53860	53860	she	1637	" I do forbid it . "
53949	53955	53957	53957	he	109	" Your Highness 's daughter , "
53959	54038	53957	53957	he	109	" spoke a minute since of the hazards my friends and I have run to compass her escape . As regards four of us , the words reached beyond our deserts . For we are men . Such hazards are our portion ; they are seldom lightened by so high an aim . But the fifth ! The words , however kind , were still below that fifth one 's merits ; for the fifth is a woman . "
54039	54059	54133	54134	The mother	569	" I know . With all my heart I thank her . With all my heart I pity her . "
54060	54132	54133	54134	The mother	569	" But there is one thing your Highness does not know . She runs our risks,—the risk of capture , the risk of the night , the storm , the snow , she a woman by nature timid and frail,—yet with never in all her life so great a reason for timidity , or so much frailty of health as now . We venture our lives , but she ventures more . "
54145	54152	54153	54153	she	116	" Speak plainly , my friend , "
54156	54163	54153	54153	she	116	" There are no children here . "
54164	54228	54229	54230	The mother	569	" Madam , I need but quote to you the words her husband used . For my part , I think that nobler words were never spoken , and with her whole heart she repeats them . They are these : ' The boy would only live to serve his King ; why should he not serve his King before he lives ? ' "
54275	54279	54270	54270	she	116	" Her name . "
54336	54386	54325	54325	her	3107	" How comes it , sir , that with such servants your King still does not sit upon his throne ? My daughter shall not fall below the great example set to her . My fears are shamed by it . My daughter goes with you to - night . "
54436	54439	54441	54441	Wogan	109	" Jenny , "
54450	54453	54455	54455	he	109	" Quiet , "
54457	54464	54455	54455	he	109	" you will wake the house . "
54465	54482	54423	54423	him	125	" Well , if you had to walk upstairs in the dark in these horrible shoes — "
54483	54493	54455	54455	he	109	" Oh , Jenny , your cloak , quick ! "
54494	54515	54455	54455	he	109	" Take the thing ! A good riddance to it ; it 's dripping wet , and weighs a ton . "
54516	54520	54522	54523	the mother	569	" Dripping wet ! "
54525	54533	54535	54535	Clementina	116	" I shall not wear it long , "
54641	54644	54645	54645	she	161	" Damn ! "
54662	54687	54645	54645	she	161	" There , there , old lady ; do n't hold your hands to your ears as though a clean oath would poison them ! "
54698	54705	54706	54706	she	569	" Does she speak to me ? "
54710	54713	54715	54715	Wogan	109	" Yes , "
54722	54731	54720	54720	Jenny	161	" This is the kind - hearted aunt . "
54746	54754	54755	54755	she	116	" And you are the beautiful heiress , "
54759	54793	54755	54755	she	116	" Well , if you are going to put that wet cloak on your shoulders , I wish you joy of the first kiss O'Toole gives you when you jump into his arms . "
54805	54818	54820	54820	he	109	" Jenny , there 's the bedroom ; to bed with you ! "
54971	54976	54978	54978	Clementina	116	" I am ready , "
55002	55015	55017	55017	Wogan	109	" There 's one more thing to be done before you go , "
55079	55087	55088	55088	she	161	" There , there , old lady , "
55092	55109	55088	55088	she	161	" do n't you fret . They are very good friends your niece is going with . "
55118	55150	55151	55151	She	161	" I do n't wonder they are all mad about you , for I ca n't but say you are very handsome and richly worth the pains you have occasioned us . "
55164	55181	55151	55151	She	161	" O'Toole wo n't mind the wet cloak , my dear , when he sees you . "
55199	55204	55206	55206	Wogan	109	" Quick , Jenny , "
55208	55214	55215	55215	He	109	" to bed with you ! "
55228	55236	55237	55237	he	109	" Now you must write a letter , "
55257	55290	55237	55237	he	109	" A letter to your mother , relieving her of all complicity in your escape . Her Highness will find it to - morrow night slipped under the cover of her toilette . "
55303	55309	55310	55310	she	116	" You think of everything , "
55313	55321	55322	55322	Wogan	109	" Perhaps you have written the letter . "
55332	55341	55343	55343	he	109	" I scribbled down a few dutiful sentiments , "
55345	55359	55343	55343	he	109	" as we drove down from Nazareth , thinking it might save time . "
55360	55363	55365	55365	Clementina	116	" Mother , "
55367	55397	55365	55365	Clementina	116	" not content with contriving my escape , he will write my letters to you . Well , sir , let us hear what you have made of it . "
55517	55520	55522	55522	he	109	" Quick ! "
55524	55544	55522	55522	he	109	" Your Highness will wait for me under the fourth tree of the avenue , counting from the end . "
55636	55644	55645	55645	Wogan	109	" You must go out with her , "
55650	55659	55645	55645	Wogan	109	" and speak a word to the sentry . "
55660	55669	55671	55671	Chateaudoux	125	" At any moment the magistrate may come , "
55683	55702	55704	55704	Wogan	109	" All the more reason for the sentinel to let your sweetheart run home at her quickest step , "
55726	55732	55734	55734	he	109	" Here is my hand , "
55759	55788	55755	55755	she	116	" Promise me it shall always be at my service . I shall need friends . I am young , and I have no knowledge . Promise me ! "
56159	56163	56164	56164	she	116	" Promise me , "
56281	56285	56286	56286	he	125	" And you ! "
56297	56314	56290	56290	he	125	" The magistrate is coming . I saw the lights of the guard across the avenue . "
56338	56347	56349	56349	he	109	" I go by the way I came , "
56351	56356	56358	56358	he	109	" I have time ; "
56401	56406	56408	56408	he	109	" Courage , madam , "
56416	56425	56408	56408	he	109	" she goes to we d a king . "
56426	56434	56436	56437	the Princess	3107	" Sir , I am her mother , "
56450	56467	56408	56408	he	109	" I was wondering not of the King , but of the man the King conceals . "
56468	56475	56477	56477	Wogan	109	" You need not , madam , "
56489	56502	56503	56503	He	109	" Take his servant 's loyalty as the measure of his merits . "
56639	56642	56643	56643	he	109	" Jenny , "
56646	56652	56643	56643	he	109	" are you in bed ? "
56653	56656	56643	56643	he	109	" Yes . "
56657	56682	56683	56683	He	109	" Lie close ! Do not show your face nor speak . Only groan , and groan most delicately , or we are lost . "
56733	56737	56738	56738	she	1637	" The magistrate ! "
56741	56766	56738	56738	she	1637	" Courage , your Highness . Keep them from the bed ! Say that her eyes are weak and can not bear the light . "
56936	56940	56941	56941	he	109	" Your Highness , "
57217	57228	57230	57230	he	109	" Her Highness , your daughter , suffers so much ? "
57232	57243	57230	57230	he	109	" Sir , it is little to be wondered at . "
57262	57269	57271	57271	he	109	" She still lies in bed ? "
57288	57330	57283	57283	herself	569	" She lies in pain , and you would disturb her ; you would flash your lanterns in her eyes , that if perchance she sleeps , she may wake into a world of pain . Sir , you will not . "
57331	57335	57280	57281	The mother	569	" Your Highness — "
57336	57355	57283	57283	herself	569	" It is the mother who beseeches you . Sir , would you have me on my knees ? "
57411	57415	57416	57416	he	3207	" Your Highness , "
57419	57438	57416	57416	he	3207	" I must pray you to let me pass . I have General Heister 's orders to obey . "
57466	57471	57472	57472	she	1637	" Go , then , "
57487	57516	57472	57472	she	1637	" Since there is no humiliation to be spared us , take a candle , sir , and count the marks of suffering in my daughter 's face ; "
57531	57546	57548	57549	the magistrate	3207	" Madam , I would not press my duty an inch beyond its limits , "
57551	57567	57548	57549	the magistrate	3207	" I will stand in the doorway , and do you bid your daughter speak . "
57579	57583	57584	57584	she	1637	" My child , "
57601	57607	57608	57608	Jenny	161	" You are in pain ? "
57619	57623	57625	57625	he	3207	" Believe me , "
57627	57643	57625	57625	he	3207	" no one could more regret than I the incivilities to which I am compelled . "
57682	57691	57693	57693	he	109	" Your Highness , that was bravely done , "
58000	58019	57992	57992	Wogan	109	" Give me your hand ! There 's a white stone midway where you can set your foot . "
58105	58122	58123	58123	she	3107	" You told me of a white stone on which I might safely set my foot , "
58126	58137	58123	58123	she	3107	" Well , sir , your white stone was straw . "
58164	58167	58168	58168	he	109	" Come ! "
58336	58340	58342	58342	he	109	" This way , "
58509	58513	58514	58514	he	109	" The horses ? "
58517	58523	58525	58525	Gaydon	142	" I have ordered them , "
58527	58539	58541	58541	he	142	" at the post - house . I will fetch them ; "
58553	58558	58548	58548	Wogan	109	" And the bill ? "
58559	58565	58548	58548	Wogan	109	" I have paid it . "
58566	58576	58548	58548	Wogan	109	" There is no one awake in the house ? "
58577	58584	58548	58548	Wogan	109	" No one but the landlady . "
58585	58598	58548	58548	Wogan	109	" Good ! Can you keep her engaged until we are ready ? "
58599	58620	58621	58621	O'Toole	158	" To be sure I can . She shall never give a thought to any man of you but myself . "
58734	58739	58730	58730	Clementina	116	" I am ready . "
58740	58743	58745	58745	Wogan	109	" Come ! "
58918	58921	58923	58923	Wogan	109	" Quick ! "
58925	58933	58923	58923	Wogan	109	" we have lost too much time . "
58934	58940	58942	58942	Gaydon	142	" A bare twenty minutes , "
58944	58950	58952	58952	Wogan	109	" A good twelve hours , "
58994	59002	59004	59004	Wogan	109	" But we must keep her free ! "
59017	59022	59007	59007	he	109	" Faster ! Faster ! "
59070	59077	59078	59078	he	109	" We have lost twelve hours , "
59081	59093	59078	59078	he	109	" Oh , would to God we were come to Italy ! "
59206	59212	59213	59213	he	109	" Her Highness is ill ? "
59218	59227	59229	59229	Clementina	116	" Not the least bit in the world , "
59255	59262	59263	59263	he	109	" What is it , then ? "
59274	59291	59292	59292	Wogan	109	" You carried a packet for her Highness . It is left behind at the tavern . "
59299	59314	59315	59315	he	109	" And for this , for a petticoat or two , you hinder us , "
59321	59359	59315	59315	he	109	" There 's no petticoat in the world , though it were so stiff with gold that it stood on end of itself , that 's worth a single second of the next forty - eight hours . "
59360	59369	59370	59370	Wogan	109	" But it contains her Highness 's jewels . "
59432	59440	59441	59441	he	109	" Her Highness must lose her jewels , "
59455	59463	59464	59464	she	3138	" You are unjust , my friend , "
59467	59527	59464	59464	she	3138	" I would lose them very willingly , were there a chance no one else would discover them . But there 's no chance . The woman of the tavern will find the bundle , will open it ; very likely she has done so already . We shall have all Innspruck on our heels in half an hour ; "
59560	59573	59554	59554	He	109	" Ride back to the tavern ! Bring the packet without fail ! "
59845	59873	59839	59839	He	109	" It might be a courier to arrest us . If I shout , drive fast as you can to Nazareth , and from Nazareth to Italy . "
59885	59890	59892	59892	he	109	" I have it , "
59906	59917	59919	59919	O'Toole	158	" The landlady has a good conscience and sleeps well , "
59921	59953	59919	59919	O'Toole	158	" I found the house dark and the doors shut . They were only secured , however , by a wooden beam dropped into a couple of sockets on the inside . "
59954	59962	59964	59964	Clementina	116	" But how did you open them ? "
59966	59981	59983	59983	O'Toole	158	" Your Highness , I have , after all , a pair of arms , "
59985	59994	59983	59983	O'Toole	158	" I just pressed on the doors till — "
59995	60001	59964	59964	Clementina	116	" Till the sockets gave ? "
60002	60010	60012	60012	he	158	" No , till the beam broke , "
60018	60026	60028	60028	she	116	" That 's my six foot four ! "
60049	60069	60070	60070	He	158	" I groped my way up the stairs into the room and found the bundle untouched in the corner . "
60206	60219	60220	60220	he	109	" We have lost twelve hours , more than twelve hours now , "
60411	60421	60423	60423	Gaydon	142	" Her Highness will breakfast here , no doubt ? "
60425	60433	60435	60435	Wogan	109	" Misset will have seen to it , "
60437	60451	60435	60435	Wogan	109	" that the berlin is furnished . We can breakfast as we go . "
60605	60612	60613	60613	he	109	" She has fasted all Lent , "
60620	60630	60613	60613	he	109	" She has eaten nothing since we left Innspruck . "
60684	60691	60692	60692	he	109	" We must stop the carriage , "
60695	60698	60700	60700	Wogan	109	" No , "
60704	60711	60713	60713	he	109	" that we must not do ; "
60813	60819	60820	60820	he	109	" Her Highness is dead ! "
60823	60827	60829	60829	Wogan	109	" Drive on , "
60850	60859	60844	60844	Misset	143	" There is a spring by the roadside . "
60860	60864	60866	60866	Wogan	109	" Drive on , "
60875	60883	60868	60868	Gaydon	142	" You will stifle her , man . "
60947	60952	60953	60953	she	143	" It is nothing , "
60956	60964	60953	60953	she	143	" Take courage , my poor marmosets ; "
60972	60994	60969	60969	she	143	" There 's my six feet four with the tears in his eyes . Did ever a woman have such friends ? "
61147	61153	61155	61155	Gaydon	142	" There is no salt , "
61157	61162	61164	61164	Misset	143	" Indeed there is , "
61174	61184	61185	61185	He	1909	" I have it in my tobacco - box . "
61300	61309	61310	61310	he	109	" Is this your respect for her Highness ? "
61313	61319	61310	61310	he	109	" Is this your consideration ? "
61320	61323	61325	61325	Clementina	116	" Nay , "
61327	61337	61325	61325	Clementina	116	" you shall not chide my six feet four . "
61338	61401	61310	61310	he	109	" But he is mad , your Highness . I do n't say but what a trifle of madness is salt to a man ; but O'Toole 's clean daft to be firing his pistols off to let the whole world know who we are . Here are we not six stages from Innspruck , and already we have lost twelve hours . "
61402	61405	61325	61325	Clementina	116	" When ? "
61406	61653	61655	61655	he	1918	" Last night , before we left Innspruck , between the time when you escaped from the villa and when I joined you in the avenue . I climbed out of the window to descend as I had entered , but the sentinel had returned . I waited on the window - ledge crouched against the wall until he should show me his back . After five minutes or so he did . He stamped on the snow and marched up the lane . I let myself down and hung by my hands , but he turned on his beat before I could drop . He marched back ; I clung to the ledge , thinking that in the darkness he would pass on beneath me and never notice . He did not notice ; but my fingers were frozen and numbed with the cold . I felt them slipping ; I could cling no longer , and I fell . Luckily I fell just as he passed beneath me ; I dropped feet foremost upon his shoulders , and he went down without a cry . I left him lying stunned there on the snow ; but he will be found , or he will recover . Either way our escape will be discovered , and no later than this morning . Nay , it must already have been discovered . Already Innspruck 's bells are ringing the alarm ; already the pursuit is begun — "
61665	61670	61655	61655	he	1918	" Faster ! faster ! "
61679	61682	61674	61674	his	158	" Trinkgeldt ! "
61694	61697	61699	61699	he	1918	" But , "
61701	61763	61699	61699	he	1918	" there was a Saracen lady I learned about at school who travelled over Europe and found her lover in an alehouse in London , with no word but his name to help her over the road . Sure , it would be a strange thing if I could n't travel all over Germany with the help of ' Trinkgeldt . ' "
61774	61777	61779	61779	O'Toole	158	" Trinkgeldt ! "
62051	62056	62057	62057	he	264	" We are lost ! "
62206	62209	62210	62210	he	264	" Trinkgeldt ! "
62235	62238	62240	62240	he	109	" Silence ! "
62245	62250	62240	62240	he	109	" Mademoiselle is asleep ; "
62263	62268	62260	62260	he	109	" What is it ? "
62334	62337	62339	62339	Wogan	109	" Hush ! "
62341	62373	62339	62339	Wogan	109	" she need not know . Ride behind , O'Toole ! Your blue eyes are green with terror . Your face will tell the story , if once she sees it . "
62871	62880	62865	62865	she	116	" How long is it since you woke ? "
62887	62896	62898	62898	he	109	" I should never have slept at all , "
62900	62936	62898	62898	he	109	" I promised myself that . Not a wink of sleep betwixt Innspruck and Italy ; and here was I fast as a log this side of Trent . I think our postillion sleeps too ; "
62947	62953	62955	62955	he	109	" We have fresh relays , "
62957	62967	62955	62955	he	109	" and we travel at a snail's - pace . "
62968	62977	62979	62979	Misset	143	" The relays are only fresh to us , "
62981	63023	63024	63024	Wogan	109	" We can go no faster . There is someone ahead with three stages ' start of us,—someone of importance , it would seem , and who travels with a retinue , for he takes all the horses at each stage . "
63126	63143	63145	63145	he	1973	" We can do no more , but make a fight of it in the end , "
63147	63162	63145	63145	he	1973	" They may be few who follow us . But who is he ahead ? "
63168	63174	63176	63176	Clementina	116	" I can tell you , "
63183	63197	63176	63176	Clementina	116	" It is the Prince of Baden , and he travels to Italy . "
63279	63288	63290	63290	he	109	" Well , we can do no more , "
63329	63355	63316	63316	She	336	" Tell me of the King . I shall make mistakes in this new world . Will he have patience with me while I learn ? "
63381	63485	63374	63374	Wogan	109	" I will tell you the truest thing about the King . He needs you at his side . For all his friends , he is at heart a lonely man , throned upon sorrows . I dare to tell you that , knowing you . He needs not a mere wife , but a mate , a helpmate , to strive with him , her hand in his . Every man needs the helpmate , as I read the world . For it can not but be that a man falls below himself when he comes home always to an empty room . "
63535	63542	63526	63526	she	3107	" Does she not love you ? "
63645	63651	63652	63652	he	109	" There is no one , "
63663	63689	63690	63690	she	116	" I wish that I may hear the King speak so , and in that voice ; I shall be very sure he loves me , "
63707	63713	63714	63714	she	116	" Tell me her name ! "
63717	63809	63810	63810	Wogan	109	" What is amiss with her that she is not thankful for a true man 's love like yours ? Is she haughty ? I 'll bring her on her knees to you . Does she think her birth sets her too high in the world ? I 'll show her so much contempt , you so much courtesy , that she shall fall from her arrogance and dote upon your steps . Perhaps she is too sure of your devotion ? Why , then , I 'll make her jealous ! "
63840	63855	63828	63828	she	1984	" Madam , I beg you to believe me , there is no one ; "
63874	63885	63868	63868	he	109	" Listen ; I will make your Highness a confidence . "
63914	64388	63902	63902	he	109	resumed,—"I am lord and king of a city of dreams . Here 's the opening of a fairy tale , you will say . But when I am asleep my city 's very real ; and even now that I am awake I could draw you a map of it , though I could not name its streets . That 's my town 's one blemish . Its streets are nameless . It has taken a long while in the building , ever since my boyhood ; and indeed the work 's not finished yet , nor do I think it ever will be finished till I die , since my brain 's its architect . When I was asleep but now , I discovered a new villa , and an avenue of trees , and a tavern with red blinds which I had never remarked before . At the first there was nothing but a queer white house of which the original has fallen to ruins at Rathcoffey in Ireland . This house stood alone in a wide flat emerald plain that stretched like an untravelled sea to a circle of curving sky . There was room to build , you see , and when I left Rathcoffey and became a wanderer , the building went on apace . There are dark lanes there from Avignon between great frowning houses , narrow climbing streets from Meran , arcades from Verona , and a park of many thickets and tall poplar - trees with a long silver stretch of water . One day you will see that park from the windows of St. James . It has a wall too , my city,—a round wall enclosing it within a perfect circle ; and from whatever quarter of the plain you come towards it , you only see this wall , there 's not so much as a chimney visible above it . Once you have crowded with the caravans and traders through the gates,—for my town is busy,—you are at once in the ringing streets . I think my architect in that took Aigues Mortes for his model . Outside you have the flat , silent plain , across which the merchants creep in long trailing lines , within the noise of markets , the tramp of horses ' hoofs , the talk of men and women , and , if you listen hard , the whispers , too , of lovers . Oh , my city 's populous ! There are quiet alleys with windows opening onto them , where on summer nights you may see a young girl 's face with the moonlight on it like a glory , and in the shadow of the wall beneath , the cloaked figure of a youth . Well , I have a notion — "
64396	64409	64391	64391	he	1985	" There 's a black horse I own , my favourite horse . "
64410	64422	64424	64425	the Princess	3107	" You rode it the first time you came to Ohlau , "
64427	64434	64436	64436	Wogan	109	" Do you indeed remember that ? "
64453	64456	64450	64450	Clementina	116	" Hush ! "
64505	64508	64510	64510	Wogan	109	" Well , "
64512	64547	64510	64510	Wogan	109	" I have a notion that the lady I shall marry will come riding some sunrise on my black horse across the plain and into my city of dreams . And she has not . "
64548	64551	64553	64553	Clementina	116	" Ah , "
64555	64594	64553	64553	Clementina	116	" here 's a subterfuge , my friend . The lady you shall marry , you say . But tell me this ! Has the lady you love ridden on your black horse into your city of dreams ? "
64595	64598	64600	64600	Wogan	109	" No , "
64602	64612	64600	64600	Wogan	109	" for there is no lady whom I love . "
64625	64633	64620	64620	he	109	" Nor is there like to be . "
64634	64640	64642	64642	Clementina	116	" Then I am sure , "
64644	64651	64642	64642	Clementina	116	" Sure that I speak truth ? "
64652	64732	64733	64733	Wogan	109	" No , sure that you mislead me . It is not kind ; for here perhaps I might give you some small token of my gratitude , would you but let me . Oh , it is no matter . I shall find out who the lady is . You need not doubt it . I shall set my wits and eyes to work . There shall be marriages when I am Queen . I will find out ! "
64754	64775	64744	64744	he	109	" That you must never do . Promise that you never will ! Promise me that you will never try ; "
64857	64864	64865	64865	she	116	" Tell me of the King , "
65141	65153	65155	65155	he	109	" Let us try if we can get stronger horses here , "
65169	65176	65178	65178	he	109	" I must have fallen asleep , "
65180	65195	65178	65178	he	109	" I beseech your Highness 's forgiveness ; I have slept this long while . "
65334	65410	65411	65411	he	109	" We are stopped here . There is no help for it . We have gained on the Prince of Baden , who is no more than two stages ahead . The relays which carried him from here to the next stage have only this instant come back . They are too tired to move . So we must stay until they are refreshed . And we are still three posts this side of Trent ! "
65414	65453	65411	65411	he	109	" I would not mind were Trent behind us . But there 's no help for it . I have hired a room where the Countess and her niece can sleep until such time as we can start . "
65551	65560	65562	65562	Wogan	109	" Would we were t'other side of Trent ! "
66285	66293	66295	66295	Gaydon	142	" He is getting off his horse , "
66297	66307	66309	66309	Misset	143	" Has he ridden hard , do you think ? "
66311	66321	66322	66322	O'Toole	158	" He looks in a mighty ill - humour . "
66350	66414	66345	66345	Gaydon	142	" He is coming in . It will never do for him to find the four of us together . He may not be the courier from Innspruck ; on the other hand , he may , and seeing the four of us he will ask questions of the landlord . Seeing no more than two , he will very likely ask none . "
66457	66461	66463	66463	he	158	" Very well , "
66498	66505	66507	66507	Wogan	109	" Gaydon and I will go , "
66509	66519	66507	66507	Wogan	109	" Jack will find out the fellow 's business . "
66549	66562	66563	66563	He	158	" You speak only French , Lucius . You come from Savoy . "
66657	66665	66667	66667	he	158	" You have no doubt come far , "
66669	66688	66690	66690	he	158	" and the landlord 's a laggard . Here 's something that may comfort you till he comes ; "
66717	66725	66727	66727	Misset	143	" It is a raw hot wine , "
66729	66736	66738	66738	he	158	" and goes better with water ; "
66758	66768	66770	66770	he	3130	" I am the thirstiest man in all Germany , "
66786	66790	66792	66792	he	3130	" Save us , "
66794	66802	66792	66792	he	3130	" but this wine is devilishly strong . "
66803	66809	66811	66811	Misset	143	" Try some more water , "
66841	66847	66849	66849	he	3130	" That warms a man , "
66851	66857	66860	66860	he	3130	" It does one good ; "
66920	66928	66930	66930	he	3130	" I take the liberty , gentlemen , "
66932	66988	66989	66989	he	3130	" I am no better than a dung - heap to sit beside gentlemen . But indeed I can stand no longer . Never have I stridden across such vile slaughter - house cattle as they keep for travellers on the Brenner road . I have sprained my legs with spurring 'em . Seven times , "
66993	67027	66989	66989	he	3130	oath,—"seven times has a horse dropped under me to - day . There 's not an inch of me unbruised , curse me if there is ! I 'm a cake of mud . "
67084	67091	67073	67073	He	3130	" That looks ill for us . "
67113	67123	67110	67110	his	3130	" And which way might you gentlemen be travelling ? "
67124	67133	67135	67135	Misset	143	" To Innspruck ; we 're from Trent , "
67145	67152	67139	67140	The courier	3130	" And you too , sir ? "
67164	67185	67153	67153	O'Toole	158	" Pour moi , monsieur , je suis Savoyard . Monsieur qui vous parle , c'est mon compagnon de négoce . "
67215	67221	67222	67222	he	158	" Will you repeat that , "
67227	67231	67234	67234	his	158	" and slowly ? "
67244	67250	67252	67252	he	158	" That 's very strange , "
67260	67282	67257	67257	his	158	" I do not dispute its truth , but it is most strange . I will tell my wife of it . "
67300	67313	67314	67314	he	158	" I shall be as stiff as a mummy in the morning , "
67321	67324	67335	67335	O'Toole	158	" the bandits "
67361	67368	67370	67370	he	3130	" You have come from Trent , "
67372	67383	67370	67370	he	3130	" Did you pass a travelling carriage on the road ? "
67384	67387	67389	67389	Misset	143	" Yes , "
67391	67408	67389	67389	Misset	143	" the Prince of Baden with a large following drove into Trent as we came out . "
67409	67414	67416	67417	the courier	3130	" Yes , yes , "
67419	67428	67416	67417	the courier	3130	" But no second party behind the Prince ? "
67450	67458	67460	67461	the courier	3130	" Then I shall have the robbers , "
67463	67476	67477	67477	he	3130	" They are to be flayed alive , and they deserve it , "
67483	67488	67489	67489	He	3130	" Gallows - birds ! "
67498	67502	67491	67491	his	3130	" gallows - birds "
67527	67560	67561	67561	He	3130	" I have eaten nothing since the morning . Ah — gallows- birds — flayed alive , and hanged — no , hanged and flayed alive — no , that 's impossible . "
67580	67598	67600	67600	he	3130	" Where 's the landlord ? I want supper . I want besides to speak to him ; "
67606	67611	67613	67613	Misset	143	" As for supper , "
67615	67631	67613	67613	Misset	143	" we shall be glad if you will share ours . Travellers should be friendly . "
67697	67702	67704	67704	he	3130	" Say that again , "
67723	67732	67734	67734	he	3130	" I 'll tell my wife about it , "
67785	67794	67795	67795	Misset	143	" Prince Taxis , the Governor of Trent . "
67853	67890	67847	67847	he	3130	" The fellow brings letters from General Heister to the Governor of Trent to stop us at all costs . But his letters are destroyed , and he 's lying dead - drunk on the table . "
68000	68008	68009	68009	he	158	" He means to tell his wife , "
68018	68059	68060	68060	Misset	143	" He must be an ass . I do n't think if I had a wife I should tell her . Would you , Wogan , tell your wife if you had one ? Misset would n't tell his wife . "
68064	68077	68078	68078	he	158	" What have you drank since I went out of the room ? "
68101	68105	68107	68107	O'Toole	158	" Only water , "
68116	68127	68129	68129	he	158	" Now I would n't mind telling my wife that , "
68145	68201	68131	68131	Misset	143	" I poured my flask out into the water - bottle . It was full of burnt Strasbourg brandy , of double strength . It is as potent as opium . Neither of them will have his wits before to - morrow . It will not help us to leave O'Toole to guard the courier . "
68202	68210	68212	68212	Wogan	109	" And we can not take him , "
68214	68253	68254	68254	He	109	" There is the Princess to be thought of . We must leave him , and we can not leave him alone , for his neck 's in danger,—more than in danger if the courier wakes before him . "
68300	68312	68314	68314	he	109	" We must choose which of us three shall stay behind , "
68316	68322	68323	68323	Misset	143	" Which of us two , "
68332	68384	68385	68385	He	109	" When the Princess drives into Bologna , Charles Wogan , who first had the high heart to dare this exploit , the brain to plot , the hand to execute it,—Charles Wogan must ride at her side , not Misset , not Gaydon . I take no man 's honours . "
68522	68538	68539	68539	he	142	" It is I , then , who stay behind with O'Toole and the courier , "
68542	68583	68584	68584	He	142	" Misset has a wife ; the lot evidently falls to me . We will make a shift somehow or another to keep the fellow quiet till sundown to - morrow , which time should see you out of danger . "
68621	68690	68691	68691	He	142	" Dick , I do hate to leave you , you and Lucius . I swept you into the peril , you two , my friends , and now I leave you in the thick of it to find a way out for yourselves . But there is no remedy , is there ? I shall not rest until I see you both again . Goodbye , Lucius . "
68704	68710	68712	68712	he	142	" My six feet four , "
68718	68735	68712	68712	he	142	" you must give me the passport . Have a good care of him , Dick ; "
68996	69004	69006	69006	she	116	" You should sleep , my friend , "
69008	69015	69016	69016	he	109	" Not till we reach Italy , "
69200	69205	69206	69206	she	116	" This is Italy , "
69209	69216	69218	69218	Wogan	109	" But the Emperor 's Italy , "
69325	69332	69334	69334	he	109	" I must search through Trent , "
69336	69356	69334	69334	he	109	" on the mere chance of finding what will serve us . Your Highness must wait in the inn ; "
69369	69439	69358	69358	Clementina	116	" I dare not . My face is known in Trent , though this is the first time ever I saw it . But many gentlemen from Trent came to the Innspruck carnival , and of these a good number were kind enough to offer me their hearts . They were allowed to besiege me to their content . I must needs remain in the shelter of the carriage . "
69811	69876	69804	69805	Mr. Wogan	109	" You will present my duties to the Prince ; you will show him my passport ; you will say that the Count of Cernes has business of the last importance in Italy , and begs permission , since the Prince of Baden has hired every post - horse in the town , to requisition half a dozen farm - horses from the fields . "
69974	69985	69987	69987	Wogan	109	" Here 's a great deal of jam , sir , "
69989	70006	69987	69987	Wogan	109	" I misdoubt me but what there 's a most unpalatable pill hidden away in it . "
70007	70010	70012	70013	the secretary	412	" Indeed , "
70015	70034	70012	70013	the secretary	412	" the Prince begs you to be content and to wait for the post - horses to return . "
70035	70040	70042	70042	Wogan	109	" Ah , ah ! "
70044	70064	70065	70065	He	109	" but that 's the one thing I can not do . I must speak plainly , it appears . "
70078	70102	70103	70103	he	109	" My particular business is to catch up the Prince of Baden . He is summoned back to Innspruck . Do you understand ? "
70107	70123	70125	70126	the secretary	412	" Sir , we are well informed in Trent as to the Emperor 's wishes , "
70135	70143	70145	70145	Wogan	109	" No , no , my friend , "
70147	70174	70145	70145	Wogan	109	" It is not by the Emperor the Prince of Baden is summoned , though I have no doubt the summons is much to his taste . "
70182	70189	70190	70190	he	412	" By her Highness the Princess ? "
70193	70258	70190	70190	he	412	" She changes her mind ; she is willing where before she was obdurate . To tell you the truth , the Prince plied her too hard , and she would have none of him . Now that he turns his back and puts the miles as fast as he can between himself and her , she can not sleep for want of him . "
70266	70273	70275	70275	he	412	" Her Highness is a woman , "
70277	70318	70275	70275	he	412	" and that explains all . But it will do her no harm to suffer a little longer for her obstinacy , and , to tell you the truth , the Prince Taxis is so tormented with the gout that — "
70319	70331	70333	70333	Wogan	109	" That you are unwilling to approach him a second time , "
70335	70381	70382	70383	The secretary	412	" I have no doubt of it . I have myself seen prelates in a most unprelatical mood . But here is a case where needs must . I have not told you all . There is a devil of a fellow called Charles Wogan . "
70388	70400	70385	70385	his	412	" A mad Irishman who has vowed to free her Highness . "
70401	70412	70275	70275	he	412	" He has set out from Strasbourg with that aim . "
70413	70429	70431	70432	the secretary	412	" He will hang for it , then , but he will never rescue her ; "
70437	70459	70431	70432	the secretary	412	" I can not upon my honour vex the Prince again because a gallows - bird has prated in his cups . "
70460	70465	70467	70467	Wogan	109	" No , no , "
70469	70680	70467	70467	Wogan	109	" you do not follow me . Charles Wogan will come to the gallows over this adventure . For my part , I would have him broken on the wheel and tortured in many uncomfortable ways . These Irishmen all the world over are pestilent fellows . But the trouble is this : If her Highness hears of his attempt , she is , as you sagely discovered , a woman , a trivial , trifling thing . She will be absurd enough to imagine her rescue possible ; she will again change her mind , and it is precisely that which General Heister fears . He would have her formally betrothed to the Prince of Baden before Charles Wogan is caught and hanged sky - high . Therefore , since I was pressing into Italy , he charged me with this message to the Prince of Baden . Now observe this , if you please . Suppose that I do not overtake the Prince ; suppose that her Highness hears of Wogan 's coming and again changes her mind,—who will be to blame ? Not I , for I have done my best , not Prince Taxis , for he is not informed , but Prince Taxis 's secretary . "
70794	70806	70807	70807	she	116	" Those were the four worst hours since we left Innspruck , "
70810	70817	70807	70807	she	116	" I thought I should suffocate . "
70875	70879	70881	70881	she	116	" little woman , "
70916	70927	70929	70929	he	109	" But it was not myself alone whom I slandered , "
70931	70970	70929	70929	he	109	" Your Highness had a share of our abuse . Our heads wagged gravely over woman 's inconstancies . It was not in nature but you must change your mind . Indeed , your Highness would have laughed . "
71074	71089	71061	71061	she	3138	" You would despise any woman who had the temerity to change her mind . "
71090	71099	71061	71061	she	3138	" Nay ; I do not say that . "
71100	71182	71061	71061	she	3138	" But it is merely politeness that restrains you . You would despise her , judging her by men . When a man changes his mind , why , it is so , he changes his mind . But when a girl does , it may well be that for the first time she is seriously exercising her judgment . For her upbringing renders it natural that she should allow others to make up her mind for her at the first . "
71183	71191	71193	71193	Wogan	109	" That I think is very true , "
71214	71243	71206	71206	She	116	" You of course would never change your mind for any reason , once it was fixed . You are resolute . You are quite , quite perfect . "
71259	71262	71263	71263	he	109	" Madam , "
71266	71298	71263	71263	he	109	" I am not in truth so obstinate a fellow as you make me out . I have often changed my mind . I take some pride in it on occasion . "
71307	71334	71335	71335	Wogan	109	" I am glad to know it . You shall give me examples . One may have a stiff neck and yet no cause for pride . "
71586	71591	71593	71593	he	109	" There is water , "
71595	71602	71593	71593	he	109	" It is ankle - deep . "
71603	71609	71610	71610	she	116	" And no white stone , "
71616	71625	71610	71610	she	116	" whereon I can safely set my foot ? "
71626	71629	71631	71631	he	109	" No , "
71633	71644	71646	71646	he	109	" but you can trust without fear to my arms ; "
71653	71657	71659	71659	she	116	" Can I ? "
72062	72090	72044	72044	she	116	" I know . Ah , but well I know . Last night I dreamed ; I rode on your black horse into your city of dreams ; "
72169	72176	72178	72178	he	109	" We must walk to Ala , "
72180	72186	72188	72188	she	116	" It is as well , "
72190	72212	72188	72188	she	116	" There was a time when cavaliers laid their cloaks in the mud to save a lady 's shoe - sole . "
72213	72216	72218	72218	Wogan	109	" Madam , "
72220	72232	72218	72218	Wogan	109	" the chivalry of to - day has the same intention . "
72233	72239	72241	72241	she	116	" But in its effect , "
72243	72249	72241	72241	she	116	" it is more rheumatical . "
72286	72294	72296	72296	he	109	" I would not part with it , "
72298	72316	72296	72296	he	109	" I never travelled for four days without being put to it for a piece of rope . "
72867	72871	72836	72836	he	109	" The Golden Lion "
72973	73023	72962	72962	Wogan	109	" Your Highness and Mrs. Misset can ride in the cart . It has no springs , to be sure , and may shake to pieces like plaster . But if it carries you five miles , it will serve . Misset and I can run by the side . "
73024	73032	73034	73034	Clementina	116	" But Lucy Misset must not go , "
73036	73071	73034	73034	Clementina	116	" She is ill , and no wonder . She must not take one step more to - night . There would be great danger , and indeed she has endured enough for me . "
73105	73128	73098	73098	He	109	" Yet we can not leave her here alone ; and of us two men , her husband must stay with her . "
73129	73137	73139	73139	Clementina	116	" Dare we wait till the morning ? "
73141	73148	73149	73149	Wogan	109	" Lucy may be recovered then . "
73154	73197	73149	73149	Wogan	109	" The courier we stopped at Wellishmile was not the only man sent after us . Of that we may be very sure . Here are we five miles from safety , and while those five miles are still unbridged — Listen ! "
73235	73242	73244	73244	Clementina	116	" The rider comes from Italy , "
73246	73255	73257	73257	Wogan	109	" But he might have come from Trent , "
73259	73313	73257	73257	Wogan	109	" We left Trent behind twelve hours ago , and more . For twelve hours we crept and crawled along the road ; these last miles we have walked . Any moment the Emperor 's troopers might come riding after us . Ah , but we are not safe ! I am afraid ! "
73326	73329	73330	73330	she	116	" You ! "
73363	73370	73371	73371	he	109	" Yes , I am afraid , "
73380	73509	73371	73371	he	109	" When I have all but won through the danger , then comes my moment of fear . In the thick of it , perils tread too close upon the heels of peril for a man to count them up . Each minute claims your hands and eyes and brain,—claims you and inspires you . But when the danger 's less , and though less still threatens ; when you 're just this side of safety 's frontier and not safe,—indeed , indeed , one should be afraid . A vain spirit of confidence , and the tired head nods , and the blow falls on it from nowhere . Oh , but I have seen examples times out of mind . I beg you , no delay ! "
73549	73557	73559	73559	Wogan	109	" He is riding to the door , "
73561	73569	73571	73571	he	109	" The light falls on your face ; "
73638	73644	73646	73646	he	109	" He rides into Austria ! "
73648	73679	73646	73646	he	109	" He rides to Trent , to Brixen , to Innspruck ! And in haste . Let us go ! I had even a fancy that I knew his voice . "
73680	73745	73799	73799	Misset	143	" From a single oath uttered in anger ! Nay , you are all fears . For my part , I was afraid that he had it in his mind to stay here at this inn where my little woman lies . What if suspicion fall on her ? What if those troopers of the Emperor find her and guess the part she played ! "
73746	73755	73757	73757	Wogan	109	" You make her safe by seeking safety , "
73759	73790	73791	73791	Wogan	109	" You are the prey the Emperor flies at . Once you are out of reach , his mere dignity must hold him in from wreaking vengeance on your friends . "
74220	74238	74240	74240	he	109	" There is a high wall behind us . It stretches across the fields from either side , "
74242	74251	74240	74240	he	109	" It makes a gateway of the road . "
74264	74268	74270	74270	she	116	" A gateway , "
74272	74279	74270	74270	she	116	" through which we have passed . "
74280	74286	74288	74288	Wogan	109	" The gateway of Italy , "
74378	74388	74372	74372	she	116	" There are worse lives than a gipsy 's . "
74389	74395	74397	74397	Wogan	109	" Are there any better ? "
74497	74507	74491	74491	their	2265	" There are worse lives than a gipsy 's . "
74508	74514	74515	74515	Both	2266	" Are there any better ? "
74686	74690	74692	74692	Clementina	116	" Drive on , "
74882	74889	74890	74890	she	116	" Will you wait for me ? "
74893	74900	74901	74901	Wogan	109	" I will not be long . "
74906	74912	74914	74914	he	109	" You would give thanks ? "
74916	74920	74914	74914	he	109	" I understand . "
74921	74935	74937	74937	Clementina	116	" I would pray for an honest heart wherewith to give honest thanks , "
74949	74977	74945	74945	she	116	" There is a life of ceremonies , there is a life of cities before me . I have lived under the skies these last two days . "
75097	75103	75104	75104	she	116	" It is the King , "
75115	75123	75104	75104	she	116	" It is the King 's servant . "
75177	75193	75194	75194	she	116	" It is the King ! It is the King ! It is the King ! "
75218	75228	75211	75212	Charles Wogan	109	" No , it is the King 's servant . "
75456	75462	75463	75463	he	109	" Did he recognise you ? "
75466	75472	75474	75474	Clementina	116	" He was not sure , "
75476	75486	75474	75474	Clementina	116	" How did you know he was at Mass ? "
75487	75496	75497	75497	Clementina	116	" A native I spoke with told me . "
75504	75513	75514	75514	she	116	" The Prince is not a generous man , "
75612	75619	75621	75621	Wogan	109	" He leaves Peri at nine , "
75623	75658	75621	75621	Wogan	109	" He will have no time to make inquiries . We have but to avoid the inn he stays at . There is a second at the head of the village which we passed . "
75688	75696	75698	75698	she	2309	" A lodging indeed you shall have , "
75700	75771	75698	75698	she	2309	" and a better lodging than the Prince of Baden can look back upon , though he pay never so dearly for it . Poor man , he will have slept wakefully this night ! Here , sir , you will find honest board and an honest bed for yourself and your sweet lady , and an honest bill to set you off in a sweet humour in the morning . "
75772	75779	75781	75781	Wogan	109	" Nay , my good woman , "
75785	75844	75845	75845	Wogan	109	" This is no sweet lady of mine , nor are we like to stay until the morrow . The truth is , we are a party of four , but our carriage snapped its axle some miles back . The young lady 's uncle and aunt are following us , and we wait only for their arrival . "
75993	75999	76001	76001	he	109	" It is very likely , "
76003	76034	76001	76001	he	109	" that my friends when they come will , after all , choose to stay here for the night . I will hire all the rooms upon the first floor . "
76340	76349	76351	76351	he	109	" There is no sign of Captain Misset , "
76417	76428	76408	76408	she	116	" Must we wait , then , till the morning ? "
76429	76463	76408	76408	she	116	" There is a chance that they may come before the morning . I will watch on the top stair , and if they come I will make bold to wake your Highness . "
76535	76544	76545	76545	he	109	" Have you other lodgers to - night ? "
76549	76554	76556	76556	she	116	" No , sir , "
76558	76589	76556	76556	she	116	" Travellers are taken by a big house and a bustle of servants . They stay at the Vapore Inn when they stay at Peri , and to their cost . "
76604	76611	76598	76598	Wogan	109	" When did her manner change ? "
76612	76622	76624	76624	Clementina	116	" I had not remarked the change till now , "
77041	77051	77052	77052	he	109	" Now where are the masters of those horses ? "
77056	77089	77052	77052	he	109	" Why do they leave their cattle at this inn and not show themselves in the kitchen or the courtyard ? Why do they not ask for a couple of my rooms ? "
77211	77238	77242	77242	he	109	" Your Highness laughed at me for that I would not part with my rope . I have a fear this night will prove my wisdom . "
77358	77364	77366	77366	he	109	" Your Highness has courage , "
77368	77391	77366	77366	he	109	" The ladder does not touch the ground , but it will not be far to drop , should there be need . "
77451	77455	77456	77456	he	109	" Your Highness , "
77459	77550	77456	77456	he	109	" there may be no cause for any alarm . On the other hand , the Governor of Trent may have taken a leaf from my own book . He may have it in mind to snatch your Highness out of Italy even as I did out of Austria ; and of a truth it would be the easier undertaking . Here are we five miles from the border and in a small tavern set apart from a small village , instead of in the thick of an armed town . "
77551	77558	77559	77559	she	2385	" But we might start now , "
77562	77579	77456	77456	he	109	" We might leave a message behind for Mrs. Misset and wait for her in Verona . "
77580	77664	77456	77456	he	109	" I had thought of that . But if my mere suspicion is the truth , the six men will not be so far from their six horses that we could drive away unnoticed by any one of them . Nor could we hope to outpace them and six men upon an open road ; indeed , I would sooner face them at the head of my staircase here . And while I hold them back your Highness can creep down that ladder . "
77665	77672	77673	77673	she	2386	" And hide in the thicket , "
77676	77693	77695	77695	her	2386	" Yet — yet — that leaves you alone . I could give you some help ; "
77699	77721	77695	77695	her	2386	" You were so kind as to tell me I had courage . I could at the least load your pistols . "
77722	77728	77730	77730	Wogan	109	" You would do that ? "
77732	77742	77730	77730	Wogan	109	" Aye , but you would , you would ! "
77859	77866	77867	77867	he	109	" You would load my pistols ! "
77875	77990	77867	77867	he	109	" To be sure , you would do that . But I ask you , I think , for a higher courage . I ask you to climb down that ladder , to run alone , taking shelter when there 's need , back to that narrow gorge we saw where the path leads upwards to the bluff . There was a hut ; two hours would take you to it , and there you should be safe . I will keep the enemy back till you are gone . If I can , when all is over here I 'll follow you . If I do not come , why , you must — "
77991	77999	78001	78001	she	2395	" Ah , but you will come , "
78007	78018	78020	78020	she	2395	" I have no fears but that you will come ; "
78023	78033	78020	78020	she	2395	" Else would you never persuade me to go . "
78034	78090	78094	78094	he	109	" Well , then , I will come . At all events , Captain Misset and his wife will surely come down the road to - morrow . If I rap twice upon your door , you will take that for my signal . But it is very likely I shall not rap at all . "
78207	78216	78217	78217	she	116	" What if I watched to - night ? "
78220	78226	78217	78217	she	116	" What if you slept ? "
78233	78240	78242	78242	he	109	" I shall sleep very well , "
78244	78266	78242	78242	he	109	" upon that top stair . I can count upon waking , though only the lowest step tremble beneath a foot . "
78345	78399	78329	78329	She	116	" Let me watch to - night . There is no danger . You are racked by sleeplessness , and phantoms born of it wear the face of truth to you . We are safe ; we are in Italy . The stars tell me so . Let me watch to - night . "
78480	78486	78488	78488	he	109	" Go to your room , "
78490	78497	78488	78488	he	109	" You must not stay here . "
78508	78512	78513	78513	he	109	" Every minute , "
78521	78676	78513	78513	he	109	" I bid myself remember the great gulf between you and me ; every minute you forget it . I make a curtain of your rank , your title , and — let us be frank — your destiny ; I hang the curtain up between us , and with a gentle hand you tear it down . At the end of it all I am flesh and blood . Why did I sit the whole long dreary day out on the bank by the roadside there ? To watch ? I could not describe to you one traveller out of them all who passed . Why , then ? Ask yourself ! It was not that I might stand by your side afterwards in the glamour of an Italian night with the stars pulsing overhead like a smile upon your lips , and all the world whispering ! You must not stay here ! "
78886	78895	78896	78896	she	2409	" I had no thought to hurt you , "
78931	78936	78938	78938	he	109	" Lock your door , "
79439	79447	79448	79448	he	109	" Was there truth in the dream ? "
79767	79772	79774	79774	Wogan	109	" An honest man , "
79776	79789	79774	79774	Wogan	109	" does not take off his boots before he mounts the stairs . "
80084	80087	80089	80089	he	109	" Gentlemen , "
80091	80108	80089	80089	he	109	" I grieve to disappoint you ; but I have hired this lodging for the night . "
80122	80127	80128	80128	he	109	" You are awake ? "
80131	80139	80128	80128	he	109	" It is a habit of mine . "
80153	80171	80144	80144	his	1056	" Then we are saved some loss of time . For we were coming to awake you . "
80172	80182	80184	80184	Wogan	109	" It was on that account , no doubt , "
80190	80255	80187	80187	his	109	" that you have all taken off your boots . But , pardon me , your four friends behind appear in spite of what I have said to be thrusting you forward . I beg you to remain on the step on which you stand . For if you mount one more , you will put me to the inconvenience of drawing my sword . "
80326	80350	80320	80320	he	2452	" I warn you to use no violence to officers in discharge of their duty . We hold a warrant for your arrest . "
80351	80354	80356	80356	Wogan	109	" Indeed ? "
80365	80379	80356	80356	Wogan	109	" I can not bring myself to believe it . On what counts ? "
80380	80409	80320	80320	he	2452	" Firstly , in that you stole away her Highness the Princess Clementina from the Emperor 's guardianship on the night of the 27th of April at Innspruck . "
80410	80417	80419	80419	Wogan	109	" Did I indeed do that ? "
80423	80441	80443	80443	he	109	" Upon my word , this cloak of mine is frayed . I had not noticed it ; "
80455	80487	80488	80488	Wogan	109	" In the second place , you did kill and put to death , at a wayside inn outside Stuttgart , one Anton Gans , servant to the Countess of Berg . "
80492	80576	80488	80488	Wogan	109	" I should be given a medal for that with a most beautiful ribbon of salmon colour , I fancy , salmon or aquamarine . Which would look best , do you think , on a coat of black velvet ? I wear black velvet , as your relations will too , my friend , if you forget which step your foot is on . Shall we say salmon colour for the ribbon ? The servant was a noxious fellow . We will . "
80606	80614	80597	80597	Wogan	109	" You say you have a warrant ? "
80643	80652	80633	80637	the last of the four	2456	" We have . The Emperor 's warrant . "
80653	80659	80661	80661	Wogan	109	" And how comes it , "
80663	80673	80661	80661	Wogan	109	" that the Emperor 's warrant runs in Venice ? "
80674	80684	80691	80691	he	2458	" Because the Emperor 's arm strikes in Venice , "
80701	80709	80711	80711	Wogan	109	" That we have yet to see , "
80762	80772	80774	80774	Wogan	109	" The Emperor 's arm shakes , it seems , "
80800	80805	80807	80807	Wogan	109	" I warned you , "
80885	80889	80890	80890	he	109	" Make room , "
80900	80911	80913	80913	Wogan	109	" Here 's a fellow in the most desperate hurry , "
80940	80954	80955	80955	he	109	" The Emperor 's arm is weak , too , one might believe , "
81364	81367	81369	81369	Wogan	109	" You ! "
81371	81383	81385	81385	he	2468	" Sure , here 's a rabbit attacking a terrier dog ; "
81411	81420	81422	81422	Wogan	109	" Now what will I do to you ? "
81424	81458	81422	81422	Wogan	109	" Did you not fire at my back ? That 's reprehensible cowardice . And with my own pistol , too , which is sheer impertinence . What will I do with you ? "
81483	81496	81498	81498	he	109	" Well , you have put me to a deal of inconvenience , "
81500	81548	81498	81498	he	109	" but I will be merciful , being strong , being most extraordinary strong . I 'll send you back to your master the Emperor with a message from me that four men are no manner of use at all . Come in here for a bit . "
81798	81806	81808	81808	Wogan	109	" Now where is that pretty warrant ? "
81819	81829	81831	81832	the man	365	" It is signed by the Governor of Trent , "
81834	81849	81831	81832	the man	365	" Who in those regions is the Emperor 's deputy . Hand it over . "
81857	81860	81862	81862	Wogan	109	" Now , "
81864	81912	81862	81862	Wogan	109	" here is paper and ink and a chair . Sit down and write a full confession of your audacious incursion into a friendly country , and just write , if you please , how much you paid the landlady to hear nothing of what was doing . "
81913	81922	81924	81925	the fellow	3410	" You will not force me to that , "
81927	81967	81924	81925	the fellow	3410	" By no means . The confession must be voluntary and written of your own free will . So write it , my friend , without any compulsion whatever , or I 'll throw you out of the window . "
81992	81999	82001	82001	he	109	" But there 's an omission , "
82003	82012	82001	82001	he	109	" You make mention of only five men . "
82013	82023	82083	82084	The soldier	2468	" There were only five men on the staircase . "
82024	82082	82083	82084	The soldier	2468	" But there are six horses in the stables . Will you be good enough to write down at what hour on what day Mr. Harry Whittington knocked at the Governor 's door in Trent and told the poor gout - ridden man that the Princess and Mr. Wogan had put up at the Cervo Inn at Ala. "
82092	82097	82098	82098	he	2468	" So you knew ! "
82101	82107	82109	82109	Wogan	109	" Oh , I knew , "
82113	82172	82109	82109	Wogan	109	" Look at me ! Did you ever see eyes so heavy with want of sleep , a face so worn by it , a body so jerked upon strings like a showman 's puppet ? Write , I tell you ! We who serve the King are trained to wakefulness . Write ! I am in haste ! "
82173	82181	82183	82184	the man	365	" Yet your King does not reign ! "
82208	82224	82226	82226	Wogan	109	" Did he pay you to keep silence as to his share in the business ? "
82238	82249	82229	82230	the man	365	" There is no word of it in your handwriting . "
82259	82264	82266	82266	Wogan	109	" That will do , "
82268	82278	82280	82280	he	109	" I may need it for a particular purpose ; "
82293	82300	82301	82301	he	109	" For a very particular purpose , "
82304	82332	82301	82301	he	109	" It will be well for you to convey your party back with all haste to Trent . You are on the wrong side of the border . "
83027	83033	83035	83035	she	116	" It grows towards morning ? "
83037	83047	83048	83048	he	109	" In two hours we shall have the dawn , "
83059	83066	83068	83068	Wogan	109	" You found this cabin open ? "
83070	83087	83068	83068	Wogan	109	" The door was latched . I loosed a shutter . The night is very still . "
83088	83109	83120	83120	her	116	" One might fancy there were no others alive but you and me across all the width of the world . "
83110	83116	83117	83117	she	116	" One could wish it , "
83219	83320	83214	83214	she	116	" There was trouble at Peri . I climbed from the window . I had almost forgotten . As I ran down the road past the open court , I saw a little group of men gathered about the foot of the staircase ! I was in two minds whether to come back and load your pistols or to obey you . I obeyed , but I was in much fear for you . I had almost forgotten , it seems so long ago . Tell me ! You conquered ; it is no new thing . Tell me how ! "
83368	83377	83364	83364	she	116	" How long is it till the morning ? "
83545	83552	83554	83554	Clementina	116	" Even in our short journey , "
83556	83663	83664	83664	She	116	" how it climbed hillsides angle upon angle , how it swept through the high solitudes of ice where no trees grow , where silence lives ; how it dropped down into green valleys and the noise of streams ! And it still sweeps on , through dark and light , a glimmer at night , a glare in the midday , between lines of poplars , hidden amongst vines , through lighted cities , down to Venice and the sea . If one could travel it , never retracing a step , pitching a tent by the roadside when one willed ! That were freedom ! "
83689	83695	83685	83685	she	116	" How long till morning ? "
83696	83702	83703	83703	She	116	" But one more hour . "
83716	83731	83733	83733	she	116	" You gave me some hint at Innspruck of an adventurous ride from Ohlau , "
83755	83770	83771	83771	He	2561	" into Strasbourg . Tell me its history . So will this hour pass . "
83869	83876	83877	83877	she	116	" Did you hear a step ? "
83884	83887	83877	83877	she	116	" No . "
83923	83935	83937	83937	Clementina	116	" Indeed , one would not hear a company of soldiers , "
83945	83957	83959	83959	Wogan	109	" Yet you heard my step , and it waked you , "
83966	83975	83977	83977	she	116	" I listened for it in my sleep , "
84025	84030	84031	84031	he	109	" You saw — ? "
84034	84038	84040	84040	she	116	" No one , "
84050	84057	84043	84043	her	116	" Will you close the shutter ? "
84131	84153	84127	84127	He	109	" There is no need . Who should spy on us ? What would it matter if we were spied upon ? "
84154	84163	84127	84127	He	109	" I ask you to close that shutter . "
84189	84192	84182	84182	her	116	" Why ? "
84193	84203	84205	84205	she	116	" Because I am afraid , as you are , "
84211	84280	84208	84208	she	116	" You would not have it shut . I am afraid while it stays open . There is too much expectation in the night . Those great black pines stand waiting ; the stars are very bright and still , they wait , holding their breath . It seems to me the whirl of the earth has stopped . Never was there a night so hushed in expectation ; "
84313	84318	84319	84319	she	116	" I am afraid , "
84322	84334	84319	84319	she	116	" of you and me . I am the more afraid ; "
84364	84372	84373	84373	she	116	" How long is it till dawn ? "
84376	84383	84385	84385	Wogan	109	" We have half an hour , "
84387	84429	84385	84385	Wogan	109	" Well , that old man — Count von Ahlen , you said — received you , heaped logs upon his fire , stanched your wounds , and asked no questions . Well ? You stopped suddenly . Tell me all ! "
84444	84459	84439	84439	himself	109	" All ? I will . It will be no new thing to you ; "
84488	84563	84470	84470	he	109	" Why did he ask no question , seeing me disordered , wounded , a bandit , for all he knew , with a murder on my hands ? Because thirty years before Count Philip Christopher von Königsmarck had come in just that same way over the lawn to the window , and had sat by that log - fire and charmed the old gentleman into an envy by his incomparable elegance and wit . "
84564	84567	84569	84570	the girl	336	" Königsmarck ! "
84588	84598	84572	84572	She	336	" He came as you did , and wounded ? "
84599	84611	84612	84612	Wogan	109	" The Princess Sophia Dorothea was visiting the Duke of Würtemberg , "
84619	84628	84629	84629	he	109	" Count Otto von Ahlen , my host , "
84632	84738	84629	84629	he	109	" had a momentary thought that I was Königsmarck mysteriously returned as he had mysteriously vanished ; and through these thirty years ' retention of his youth , Count Otto could never think of Königsmarck but as a man young and tossed in a froth of passion . He would have it to the end that I had escaped from such venture as had Königsmarck ; he would have it my wounds were the mere offset to a love well worth them ; he would envy me . ' Passion , ' said he , ' without passion there can be no great thing . ' "
84739	84748	84750	84750	Clementina	116	" And the saying lived in your thoughts , "
84752	84777	84750	84750	Clementina	116	" I do not wonder . ' Without passion there can be no great thing ! ' Can books teach a man so much ? "
84778	84840	84629	84629	he	109	" Nay , it was an hour 's talk with Königsmarck which set the old man 's thoughts that way ; and though Königsmarck talked never so well , I would not likely infer from his talk an eternal and universal truth . Count Otto left me alone while he fetched me food , and he left me in a panic . "
84841	84845	84847	84847	Clementina	116	" A panic ? "
84854	84857	84847	84847	Clementina	116	" You ! "
84858	84878	84629	84629	he	109	" Yes . That first mistake of me for Königsmarck , that insistence that my case was Königsmarck 's — "
84879	84892	84894	84894	Clementina	116	" There was a shadow of truth in it — even then ? "
84920	84936	84937	84937	he	2574	" I sat alone , feeling the ghost of Königsmarck in the room with me , "
84966	85014	84961	84961	their	2576	" I heard his voice menacing me . ' For love of a queen I lived . For love of a queen I died most horribly ; and it would have gone better with the queen had she died the same death at the same time — ' "
85026	85119	85122	85122	she	116	" Ah , who can say that , and know it for the truth — except the Queen ? You must ask her in her prison at Ahlden , and that you can not do . She has her memories maybe . Maybe she has built herself within these thirty years a world of thought so real , it makes her gaolers shadows , and that prison a place of no account , save that it gives her solitude and is so more desirable than a palace . I can imagine it ; "
85138	85155	85122	85122	she	116	" You looked round you but now and most fearfully . Is Königsmarck 's spirit here ? "
85156	85159	85161	85161	Wogan	109	" No , "
85163	85207	85208	85208	he	109	" I would to God it were ! I would I felt its memories chilling me as they chilled me that night ! But I can not . I can not as much as hear a whisper . All the heavens are dumb , "
85211	85217	85219	85219	Clementina	116	" And the earth waits , "
85310	85318	85320	85320	Wogan	109	" All the way up from Peri , "
85324	85341	85320	85320	Wogan	109	" I strove to make real to myself the ignominy , the odium , the scandal . "
85342	85348	85350	85350	Clementina	116	" But you could not , "
85369	85414	85350	85350	Clementina	116	" When I reached the hut , and saw that fan of light spreading from the window , as it spread over the lawn beyond Stuttgart , I remembered Otto von Ahlen and his talk of Königsmarck . I tried to hear the menaces . "
85415	85421	85320	85320	Wogan	109	" But you could not . "
85422	85432	85433	85433	he	109	" No . I saw you through the window , "
85436	85538	85433	85433	he	109	" stretched out upon that couch , supple and young and sweet . I saw the lamplight on your hair , searching out the gold in its dark brown . I could only remember how often I have at nights wakened and reached out my hands in the vain dream that they would meet in its thick coils , that I should feel its silk curl and nestle about my fingers . There 's the truth out , though it 's a familiar truth to you ever since I held you in my arms beneath the stars upon the road to Ala. "
85539	85549	85551	85551	she	2580	" It was known to me a day before , "
85553	85570	85551	85551	she	2580	" but it was known to you so long ago as that night in the garden . "
85571	85577	85579	85579	Wogan	109	" Oh , before then , "
85581	85597	85579	85579	Wogan	109	" When ? Let the whole truth be known , since we know so much . "
85598	85608	85551	85551	she	2580	" Why , on that first day at Ohlau . "
85609	85634	85551	85551	she	2580	" In the great hall . I stood by the fire and raised my head , and our eyes met . I do remember . "
85635	85663	85665	85665	he	109	" But I had no thought ever to let you know . I was the King 's man - at - arms , as I am now ; "
85672	85755	85665	85665	he	109	" Here 's madness ! The King 's man - at - arms dumps him down in the King 's chair ! I had a thought to live to you , if you understand , as a man writes a poem to his mistress , to make my life the poem , an unsigned poem that you would never read , and yet unsigned , unread , would make its creator glad and fill his days . And here 's the poem ! "
85843	85857	85834	85834	she	116	" You are hurt . Again for love of me you are hurt . "
85858	85865	85866	85866	he	109	" It is not my wound , "
85869	85878	85879	85879	he	109	" It is blood I spilt for you ; "
86029	86038	86039	86039	he	109	" The blood upon my coat is wet , "
86095	86103	86104	86104	he	109	" See , the blood stains you ! "
86107	86116	86117	86117	she	116	" Why , then , I share it , "
86126	86133	86135	86135	she	116	" I share it with you ; "
86181	86188	86189	86189	he	109	" That 's John Sobieski speaking , "
86199	86215	86189	86189	he	109	" Poland 's King ! But I was mad ! Indeed , I blame myself . "
86216	86219	86220	86220	she	116	" Blame ! "
86234	86342	86344	86344	she	116	" Are we to blame ? We are man and woman . Who shall cast the stone ? Are you to blame for that you love me ? Who shall blame you ? Not I , who thank you from my heart . Am I to blame ? What have we hearts for , then , if not to love ? I have a thought — it may be very wrong . I do not know . I do not trouble to think — that I should be much more to blame did I not love you too . There 's the word spoken at the last , "
86415	86424	86425	86425	she	116	" I believe the spoken truth is best , "
86438	86504	86425	86425	she	116	" Unspoken and yet known by both of us , I think it would breed thoughts and humours we are best without . Unspoken our eyes would question , each to other , at every meeting ; there would be no health in our thoughts . But here 's the truth out , and I am glad — in whichever way you find its consequence . "
86530	86538	86540	86540	Wogan	109	" In whichever way — I — ? "
86542	86545	86546	86546	she	116	" Yes , "
86549	86609	86610	86610	Wogan	109	" There is Bologna . Say that Bologna is our goal . I shall go with you to Bologna . There is Venice and the sea . Bid me go , then ; hoist a poor scrap of a sail in an open boat . I shall adventure over the wide seas with you . What will you do ? "
86654	86659	86649	86649	he	109	" There is Ohlau . "
86691	86697	86683	86683	she	336	" What will you do ? "
86698	86705	86706	86706	he	109	" You would lose a throne , "
86730	86743	86750	86750	her	336	" You would become the mock of Europe,—you that are its wonder ; "
86759	86765	86766	86766	she	336	" What will you do ? "
87118	87124	87126	87126	he	109	" We travel to Bologna , "
87128	87163	87126	87126	he	109	" I will not have you wasted . Other women may slink into kennels and stop their ears — not you . The King is true to you . You are for the King . "
87241	87249	87251	87251	she	2287	" I am to marry the King , "
87253	87256	87258	87258	Wogan	109	" Yes , "
87260	87264	87265	87265	she	2287	" But you ? "
87274	87286	87265	87265	she	2287	" there is no compulsion on you to marry — anyone . "
87315	87319	87320	87320	he	109	" No woman , "
87323	87346	87320	87320	he	109	" will ride on my black horse into my city of dreams . You may be very sure I will not marry . "
87347	87357	87358	87358	Wogan	109	" No . I would not have you married . "
87613	87749	87605	87605	she	3107	" Five days ago I was in prison at Innspruck , perpetually harassed and with no hope of release but in you . Now I am in Bologna , and free . I could not believe that any girl could find such friends except in fairyland . You make the world very sweet and clean to me . I should thank you . See my tears fall ! Will you take them for my thanks ? I have no words which can tell as much of my thoughts towards you . My little woman I keep with me , but to you gentlemen I would gladly give a token each , so that you may know I will never forget , and so that you too may keep for me a home within your memories . "
87777	87783	87785	87785	she	2617	" her six feet four , "
87824	87831	87833	87833	she	116	" To you , my friend , "
87835	87885	87833	87833	she	116	" I give nothing . There is no need . But I ask for something . I would be in debt to you still deeper than I am . I ask for a handkerchief which I dropped from my shoulders one evening under the stars upon the road to Ala. "
87903	87908	87910	87910	he	109	" It is true , "
87912	87920	87922	87922	he	109	" I have no right to it ; "
87936	87942	87944	87944	she	116	" You do not understand , "
87951	88000	87944	87944	she	116	" You have every right which the truest loyalty can confer . I ask you for this handkerchief , because I think at times to wear it in memory of a white stone on which I could safely set my foot , for the stone was not straw . "
88022	88025	88027	88027	she	116	" No , "
88029	88042	88027	88027	she	116	" as at Innspruck , an honest handclasp , if you please . "
88070	88078	88080	88080	Gaydon	142	" Here 's a great work ended , "
88084	88090	88092	88092	O'Toole	158	" We shall be historical , "
88094	88147	88150	88150	he	142	" It is my one ambition . I want to figure in the history - books and be a great plague and nuisance to children at school . I would sooner be cursed daily by schoolboys than have any number of golden statues in galleries . It means the more solid reputation ; "
88216	88234	88235	88235	he	142	" Well , we may go to bed and sleep without alarms till sundown to - morrow , "
88239	88254	88235	88235	he	142	" There 's Jenny . It was on my account she ventured with us . "
88255	88260	88262	88262	Wogan	109	" That 's true , "
88264	88298	88262	88262	Wogan	109	" but we shall put an end to her captivity , now we are safe at Bologna . I have friends here who can serve me so far , I have no doubt . "
88366	88373	88375	88375	Wogan	109	" I trust , your Eminence , "
88377	88385	88375	88375	Wogan	109	" that Farini is now at Bologna . "
88386	88395	88397	88398	the Cardinal	430	" You come in the nick of time , "
88400	88435	88397	88398	the Cardinal	430	" This is his last week . There is a great demand for the seats ; but you will see to it , Mr. Wogan , that the box is in the first tier . "
88436	88467	88375	88375	Wogan	109	" There was to be a dinner , too , if I recollect aright . I have not dined for days . Your Eminence , I shall be extraordinarily hungry . "
88468	88492	88397	88398	the Cardinal	430	" You will order what you will , Mr. Wogan . I am a man of a small appetite and have no preferences . "
88493	88557	88558	88559	The Cardinal	430	" Your Eminence 's cook will be the better judge of what is seasonable . Your Eminence will be the more likely to secure the box in the first tier . Shall we fix a day ? To - morrow , if it please you . To - morrow I shall have the honour , then , to be your Eminence 's guest . "
88571	88576	88578	88578	he	430	" You are jesting , "
88580	88584	88586	88586	Wogan	109	" So little , "
88588	88606	88586	88586	Wogan	109	" that her Highness , the Princess Clementina , is now at the Pilgrim Inn at Bologna . "
88607	88611	88613	88614	the Cardinal	430	" In Bologna ! "
88627	88633	88634	88634	he	430	" This is great news , "
88648	88658	88660	88660	he	430	" This is great news , to be sure ; "
88670	88681	88683	88683	Wogan	109	" Not wholly pleasant news , one might almost think , "
88689	88695	88697	88698	the Cardinal	430	" Never was better news , "
88710	88754	88697	88698	the Cardinal	430	" But it surprises one . Even the King did not expect this most desirable issue . For the King 's in Spain . It is that which troubles me . Her Highness comes to Bologna , and the King 's in Spain . "
88755	88758	88760	88760	Wogan	109	" Yes , "
88770	88778	88760	88760	Wogan	109	" Why is the King in Spain ? "
88779	88829	88830	88830	Wogan	109	" There is pressing business in Spain,—an expedition from Cadiz . The King 's presence there was urged most earnestly . He had no hope you would succeed . I myself have some share in the blame . I did not hide from you my thought , Mr. Wogan . "
88953	88990	89007	89008	His Eminence	444	" Her Highness I can not but feel will have reason to think slightly of our welcome . A young girl , she will expect , and rightly , something more of ceremony as her due . "
88991	88999	89001	89001	Wogan	109	" Your Eminence does not know her , "
89029	89039	89041	89041	he	109	" I shall make haste to repair my defect , "
89043	89084	89041	89041	he	109	" I beg you to present my duty to her Highness and to request her to receive me to - morrow at ten . By that , I will hope to have discovered a lodging more suitable to her dignity . "
89214	89223	89225	89225	he	109	" The King is to marry the Princess , "
89229	89246	89225	89225	he	109	" I brought her out of Innspruck to Bologna . The King must marry the Princess ; "
89550	89559	89561	89561	he	109	" Here 's a true welcome , madam , "
89617	89628	89629	89629	he	109	" This is one tiny square in a little town , "
89632	89641	89629	89629	he	109	" But its shouts will ring across Europe ; "
89654	89666	89643	89643	she	116	" The King is still in Spain , is he not ? "
89721	89729	89730	89730	he	109	" The King must marry the Princess , "
89738	89746	89735	89735	he	109	" The Princess must marry the King . "
89913	89919	89921	89921	she	116	" The man at Peri , "
89927	89934	89921	89921	she	116	" Your Highness will pardon me , "
89977	89981	89982	89982	he	109	" At Peri , "
89989	90070	89982	89982	he	109	" I waked from a dream and saw that man , bird - like and cunning , watching over the rim of the stairs . I was dreaming that a star out of heaven stooped towards me , that a woman 's face shone out of the star 's bright heart , that her lips deigned to bend downwards to my earth . And I wonder , I wonder whether those cunning eyes had cunning enough to interpret my dream . "
90078	90091	90072	90072	Clementina	116	" I think it very likely that they had so much skill ; "
90276	90280	90282	90282	he	109	" Mr. Wogan , "
90284	90351	90282	90282	he	109	" our Holy Father the Pope wishes to testify his approbation of your remarkable enterprise on behalf of a princess who is his god - daughter . He bids me hand you , therefore , your patent of Roman Senator , and request you to present yourself at the Capitol in Rome on June 15 , when you will be installed with all the ancient ceremonies . "
90366	90374	90376	90377	his Eminence	444	" You hardly know what you refuse , "
90379	90400	90376	90377	his Eminence	444	" The Holy Father has no greater honour to bestow , and , believe me , he bestows it charily . "
90401	90407	90409	90409	Wogan	109	" Nay , your Eminence , "
90411	90464	90409	90409	Wogan	109	" I do not undervalue so high a distinction . But I had three friends with me who shared every danger . I can not accept an honour which they do not share ; for indeed they risked more than I did . For they hold service under the King of France . "
90479	90487	90489	90489	he	430	" They shall not be the losers , "
90491	90535	90537	90537	he	430	" I think I may promise indeed that each will have a step in rank , and I do not doubt that when the Holy Father hears what you have said to me , I shall have three other patents like to this ; "
90546	90555	90557	90557	Wogan	109	" And what of the King in Spain ? "
90559	90572	90574	90575	the Cardinal	430	" I sent a messenger thither on the night of your coming , "
90577	90591	90574	90575	the Cardinal	430	" but it is a long journey into Spain . We must wait . "
90741	90749	90750	90750	he	109	" But she must marry the King , "
90810	90819	90820	90820	he	109	" For her own sake she must marry , "
90830	90842	90844	90844	he	109	" For ours , too , for a country 's sake ; "
90851	90856	90844	90844	he	109	" for her own sake "
90900	90911	90913	90913	he	109	" The patents carry the titles of ' Excellency , ' "
90920	90923	90925	90925	he	109	" Sure , "
90927	90970	90972	90972	he	109	" I will have a toga with the arms of the O'Tooles embroidered on the back , to appear in at the Capitol . It is on June 15 , your Eminence . Upon my soul , I have not much time ; "
90976	90997	90999	91000	the Cardinal	430	" A toga will hardly take a month , even with the embroidery , which I do not greatly recommend , "
91004	91016	91018	91018	O'Toole	158	" I was not at the moment thinking of the toga , "
91022	91031	91033	91033	Wogan	109	" And what of the King in Spain ? "
91035	91043	91045	91046	the Cardinal	430	" We must wait , my friend , "
91438	91443	91445	91445	Wogan	109	" Without a doubt , "
91447	91462	91445	91445	Wogan	109	" she has received a letter by the same messenger who brought me mine . "
91482	91489	91493	91493	himself	109	" She must marry the King , "
91824	91836	91800	91800	She	116	" You have received a letter this morning from his Majesty ? "
91837	91843	91800	91800	She	116	" Yes , your Highness . "
91844	91853	91800	91800	She	116	" Why does the King linger in Spain ? "
91854	91860	91800	91800	She	116	" The expedition from Cadiz — "
91861	91874	91875	91875	she	116	" Which left harbour a week ago . Well , Mr. Wogan , "
91881	91897	91875	91875	she	116	" how does that expedition now on the high seas detain his Majesty in Spain ? "
91927	91933	91934	91934	he	109	" Is your Highness sure ? "
91937	91945	91946	91946	she	116	" Oh , indeed , most sure , "
91963	91969	91970	91970	he	109	" I did not know , "
91989	91995	91996	91996	she	116	" Is that the truth ? "
92005	92011	91996	91996	she	116	" You did not know ? "
92109	92115	92116	92116	he	109	" It is the truth , "
92119	92156	92116	92116	he	109	" you will believe it . I pledge my soul upon it . Lay your hand in mine . I will repeat it standing so . Could I speak false with your hand close in mine ? "
92176	92181	92182	92182	she	116	" Could you not ? "
92194	92202	92203	92203	he	109	" Have I ever told you lies ? "
92211	92214	92208	92208	she	116	" Yes , "
92244	92247	92248	92248	he	109	" When ? "
92251	92260	92248	92248	he	109	" In the berlin between Brixen and Wellishmile . "
92290	92296	92285	92285	He	109	" I can not remember . "
92297	92478	92282	92282	she	116	" You told me of an attack made upon a Scottish town , what time the King was there in the year ' 15 . He forced a passage through nine grenadiers with loaded muskets and escaped over the roof - tops , where he played a game of hide - and - seek among the chimneys . Ah , you remember the story now . There was a chain , I remember , which even then as you told of it puzzled me . He threw the chain over the head of one of those nine grenadiers , and crossing his arms jerked it tight about the man 's neck , stifling his cry of warning . ' What chain ? ' I asked , and you answered,—oh , sir , with a practised readiness,—'The chain he wore about his neck . ' Do you remember that ? The chain linked your hand - locks , Mr. Wogan . It was your own escape of which you told me . Why did you ascribe your exploits to your King ? "
92479	92483	92484	92484	he	2750	" Your Highness , "
92487	92601	92484	92484	he	2750	" we know the King , we who have served him day in and day out for years . We can say freely to each other , ' The King 's achievements , they are to come . ' We were in Scotland with him , and we know they will not fail to come . But with you it 's different . You did not know him . You asked what he had done , and I told you . You asked for more . You said , ' Amongst his throng of adventurers , each of whom has something to his credit , what has he , the chief adventurer ? ' "
92602	92617	92282	92282	she	116	" Well , sir , why not the truth in answer to the question ? "
92618	92627	92282	92282	she	116	" Because the truth 's unfair to him . "
92628	92637	92282	92282	she	116	" And was the untruth fair to me ? "
92643	92649	92650	92650	she	2751	" I think I understand , "
92654	92717	92718	92718	She	2751	" you thought , here 's a foolish girl , aflame for knights and monsters overthrown . She cries for deeds , not statecraft . Well , out of your many , you would toss her one , and call it the King 's . You could afford the loss , and she , please God , would be content with it . "
92742	92803	92732	92732	she	2751	" Very likely , too , the rest of your words to me was of a piece . I was a girl , and girls are to have gallant speeches given to them like so many lollipops . Oh , but you have hurt me beyond words . I would not have thought I could have suffered so much pain ! "
92844	92850	92851	92851	he	126	" Do not believe it ! "
92854	92878	92851	92851	he	126	" Think ! Should I have been at so much pains to refrain from speech , if speech was what I had intended ? "
92879	92902	92822	92822	her	2751	" How should I know but what that concealment was part of the gallantry , a necessary preface to the pretty speeches ? "
92903	92934	92851	92851	he	126	" Should I have urged your rescue on the King had I believed you what you will have it that I did,—a mere witless girl to be pampered with follies ? "
92935	92940	92941	92941	she	2751	" Then you admit , "
92944	92950	92941	92941	she	2751	" you urged the King . "
92951	93019	92851	92851	he	126	" Should I have travelled over Europe to search for a wife and lit on you ? Should I have ridden to Ohlau and pestered your father till he yielded ? Should I have ridden across Europe to Strasbourg ? Should I have endangered my friends in the rush to Innspruck ? No , no , no ! From first to last you were the chosen woman . "
93058	93070	93071	93071	she	2753	" You spoke to me words which I have not forgotten , "
93075	93126	93071	93071	she	2753	" You said the King had need of me . I will be frank , hoping that you will match my frankness . On that morning when we climbed down the gorge , and ever since I cheered myself with that one thought . The King had need of me . "
93127	93134	93136	93136	Wogan	126	" Never was truer word spoken , "
93140	93149	93136	93136	Wogan	126	" Then why is the King in Spain ? "
93171	93177	93167	93167	He	126	" I do not know . "
93213	93230	93203	93203	she	116	" Then I will acquaint you . Will you walk with me for half a mile ? "
93291	93294	93296	93296	she	116	" Sir , "
93298	93308	93296	93296	she	116	" can you put a name to the house ? "
93309	93321	93337	93337	she	116	" Upon my word , your Highness , I can not . "
93322	93329	93331	93331	she	116	" It is the Caprara Palace , "
93373	93376	93377	93377	she	116	" No , "
93382	93388	93377	93377	she	116	" you did not know . "
93494	93506	93508	93508	she	116	" I have a great wish to see the picture gallery , "
93541	93555	93557	93557	Clementina	116	" Will you show me first the portrait of Mlle . de Caprara ? "
93650	93733	93742	93742	she	116	" There is a face , Mr. Wogan,—a passionate , beautiful face,—which might well set a seal upon a man 's heart . I do not wonder . I can well believe that though to - day that face gladdens the streets of Rome , a lover in Spain might see it through all the thick earth of the Pyrenees . There , sir , I promised to acquaint you why the King lingered in Spain . I have fulfilled that promise ; "
93804	93813	93814	93814	she	116	" It is strange , is it not , "
93821	93858	93859	93859	she	116	" that on a spring morning , beneath this sky , amongst these flowers , I should think with envy of the snows of Innspruck and my prison there ? But I owe you a reparation , "
93862	93909	93859	93859	she	116	" You said the King had need of me . For that saying of yours I find an apt simile . Call it a stone on which you bade me set my foot and step . I stepped , and found that your stone was straw . "
93910	93915	93917	93917	Wogan	126	" No , madam , "
93919	93925	93926	93926	she	116	" I had a thought , "
93929	93976	93926	93926	she	116	" you knew the stone was straw when you commended it to me as stone . But this morning I have learned my error . I acquit you , and ask your pardon . You did not know that the King had no need of me . "
94015	94022	94023	94023	He	126	" She must marry the King . "
94038	94053	94034	94034	he	126	" Nor do I know now — no , and I shall not know . "
94054	94074	94034	94034	he	126	" You have walked with me to the Caprara Palace this morning . Or did I dream we walked ? "
94075	94197	94201	94201	her	2779	" What your Highness has shown me to - day I can not gainsay . For this is the first time that ever I heard of Mlle . de Caprara . But I am very sure that you draw your inference amiss . You sit in judgment on the King , not knowing him . You push aside the firm trust of us who know him as a thing of no account . And because once , in a mood of remorse at my own presumption , I ascribed one trivial exploit — at the best a success of muscle and not brain — to the King which was not his , you strip him of all merit on the instant . "
94227	94236	94218	94218	he	2778	" Your stone is stone , not straw . "
94237	94242	94244	94244	she	2779	" Prove it me , "
94246	94291	94244	94244	she	2779	" What do you know of the Princess Caprara at the end of it all ? You have told me this morning all you know . I will go bail if the whole truth were out the matter would take a very different complexion . "
94297	94303	94293	94293	she	2779	" Prove that to me ! "
94350	94379	94344	94344	she	2779	" His Eminence the Cardinal fixes the marriage in Bologna here for to - day fortnight . You have thus two weeks wherein to make your word good . "
94408	94418	94420	94420	he	126	" Within two weeks I will convince your Highness , "
94524	94532	94534	94534	Wogan	126	" Where will I find Captain O'Toole ? "
94536	94543	94545	94546	the servant	753	" You will find his Excellency , "
94556	94566	94545	94546	the servant	753	" at the little bookseller 's in the Piazza . "
94649	94656	94657	94657	he	126	" Where shall I find Gaydon ? "
94660	94669	94671	94671	O'Toole	158	" He went towards the Via San Vitale , "
94715	94724	94726	94726	he	126	" You went to Rome in the spring , "
94728	94749	94726	94726	he	126	" There you saw the King . Did you see anyone else by any chance whilst you were in Rome ? "
94750	94753	94755	94755	Gaydon	142	" Edgar , "
94774	94777	94779	94779	he	126	" Aha ! "
94781	94804	94779	94779	he	126	" Edgar , to be sure , since you saw the King . But besides Edgar , did you see anyone else ? "
94805	94808	94810	94810	Gaydon	142	" Whittington , "
94812	94815	94817	94817	Wogan	126	" Oho ! "
94821	94840	94817	94817	Wogan	126	" So you saw my friend Harry Whittington at Rome . Did you see him with the King ? "
94847	94855	94856	94856	he	142	" He was waiting for the King , "
94859	94871	94856	94856	he	142	" Indeed . And whereabouts was he waiting for the King ? "
94872	94881	94883	94883	Gaydon	142	" Oh , outside a house in Rome , "
94893	94906	94883	94883	Gaydon	142	" It was no business of mine , that I could see . "
94907	94915	94917	94917	Wogan	126	" None whatever , to be sure , "
94921	94940	94917	94917	Wogan	126	" But why in the world should Whittington be waiting for the King outside a house in Rome ? "
94941	94953	94856	94856	he	142	" It was night - time . He carried a lantern . "
94954	94965	94967	94967	Wogan	126	" Of course , if it was night - time , "
94975	95022	94967	94967	Wogan	126	" and the King wished to pay a visit to a house in Rome , he would take an attendant with a lantern . A servant , though , one would have thought , unless , of course , it was a private sort of visit — "
95023	95031	95032	95032	Gaydon	142	" It was no business of mine , "
95035	95045	95032	95032	Gaydon	142	" and so I made no inquiries of Whittington . "
95046	95057	95059	95059	Wogan	126	" But Whittington did not wait for inquiries , eh ? "
95063	95225	95226	95226	Gaydon	142	" You are hiding something from me , my friend,—something which that good honest simpleton of a Whittington blurted out to you without the least thought of making any disclosure . Oh , I know my Whittington . And I know you , too , Dick . I do not blame you . For when the King goes a - visiting the Princess Caprara privately at night - time while the girl to whom he is betrothed suffers in prison for her courageous loyalty to him , and his best friends are risking their heads to set her free , why , there 's knowledge a man would be glad to keep even out of his own hearing . So you see I know more than you credit me with . So tell me the rest ! Do n't fob me off . Do n't plead it is none of your business , for , upon my soul , it is . "
95242	95271	95239	95239	Wogan	126	" You are in the right . It is my business , and why ? Because it touches you , Charles Wogan , and you are my friend . "
95272	95279	95281	95281	Wogan	126	" Therefore you will tell me , "
95283	95291	95293	95293	Gaydon	142	" Therefore I will not tell you , "
95335	95356	95328	95328	Wogan	126	" I must know . Here have I lost two hours out of one poor fortnight . I must know . "
95357	95360	95361	95361	Gaydon	142	" Why ? "
95390	95408	95386	95386	he	126	" Because unless I do , in a fortnight her Highness will refuse to marry the King . "
95473	95481	95483	95483	he	142	" I am afraid , my friend , "
95485	95494	95483	95483	he	142	" my thoughts have done you some wrong — "
95495	95502	95504	95504	Wogan	126	" Leave me out of them , "
95521	95534	95535	95535	Gaydon	142	" Tell me from first to last what you saw in Rome . "
95605	95610	95611	95611	he	126	" So the Princess , "
95614	95636	95611	95611	he	126	" had more than a rumour to go upon , though how she came by her knowledge the devil only knows . "
95652	95657	95659	95659	Wogan	126	" I will wait , "
95734	95750	95751	95751	he	126	" It is your presence , Mr. Wogan , puts me in a good humour , "
95757	95771	95773	95773	Wogan	109	" Or a certain letter your Eminence received from Spain to - day ? "
95775	95791	95773	95773	Wogan	109	" True , the letter was one to cause all the King 's friends satisfaction . "
95792	95803	95805	95805	Wogan	109	" And some few of them , perhaps , relief , "
95838	95847	95849	95849	he	430	" I have a hope , Mr. Wogan , "
95856	95927	95849	95849	he	430	" You shall tell me if it is to fall . I see much of you of late , and I have a hope that you are thinking of the priesthood . We should welcome you very gladly , you may be sure . Who knows but what there is a Cardinal 's hat hung up in the anteroom of the future for you to take down from its peg ? "
95961	95965	95967	95967	he	109	" Your Eminence , "
95969	95991	95967	95967	he	109	" although I hold myself unworthy of priestly vows , I am here in truth in the character of a catechist . "
95992	96000	96002	96003	the Cardinal	430	" Catechise , then , my friend , "
96009	96038	96002	96003	the Cardinal	430	" First , then , I would ask your Eminence how many of the King 's followers have had the honour of being presented to the Princess Clementina ? "
96039	96043	95967	95967	he	109	" Very few . "
96044	96051	96002	96003	the Cardinal	430	" Might I know the names ? "
96052	96057	96058	96059	Cardinal Origo	122	" To be sure . "
96126	96142	96144	96144	Origo	122	" Her Highness lives , as you know , a very suitable , secluded life , "
96146	96161	96144	96144	Origo	122	" But might not others have had access to her at the Pilgrim Inn ? "
96162	96233	96144	96144	Origo	122	" Nay , she was there but the one night,—the night of her arrival . I do not think it likely . For if you remember , I myself went to her early the next morning , and by a stroke of good luck I had already come upon the little house in the garden which was offered to me by a friend of yours for her Highness 's service . "
96234	96251	96253	96253	Wogan	109	" On the evening of our arrival ? A friend of mine offered you the house , "
96263	96269	96270	96270	Wogan	109	" Yes . Harry Whittington . "
96325	96340	96341	96341	Wogan	109	" It was Harry Whittington who offered the house for her Highness 's use ? "
96344	96354	96341	96341	Wogan	109	" It was an offer most apt and kind . "
96355	96365	96341	96341	Wogan	109	" And made on the evening of our arrival ? "
96366	96380	96381	96381	Wogan	109	" Not an hour after you left me . But you are surprised ? "
96450	96474	96441	96441	Wogan	109	" I was surprised , for I had a notion that Whittington lodged opposite the Torre Garisenda , and not at the house . "
96475	96492	96538	96539	the Cardinal	430	" Nor did he . He hired it for a friend who has now left Bologna . "
96493	96498	96500	96500	Wogan	109	" Man or woman ? "
96528	96536	96538	96539	the Cardinal	430	" I did not trouble to inquire , "
96541	96555	96538	96539	the Cardinal	430	" But , Mr. Wogan , why do you ask me these questions ? "
96556	96568	96570	96570	Wogan	109	" I have not come yet to the end of them , "
96572	96578	96570	96570	Wogan	109	" There is one more . "
96579	96583	96589	96589	his	444	" Ask it ! "
96592	96617	96585	96586	his Eminence	444	" Will your Eminence oblige me with a history of the affection of Maria Vittoria , Mlle . de Caprara , for the King ? "
96629	96636	96637	96637	he	430	" Here is a question indeed ! "
96640	96652	96654	96654	Wogan	109	" And a history of the King 's response to it , "
96658	96680	96654	96654	Wogan	109	" with a particular account of why the King lingers in Spain after the Cadiz expedition has put out to sea . "
96711	96718	96720	96720	he	2830	" This is very dangerous talk , "
96724	96731	96720	96720	he	2830	" Not so dangerous as silence . "
96732	96743	96720	96720	he	2830	" Some foolish slanderer has been busy at your ears . "
96744	96750	96752	96752	Wogan	109	" Not at my ears , "
96760	96767	96769	96769	he	430	" Is it so , indeed ? "
96787	96799	96778	96778	he	430	" But here 's the King 's letter come this morning . "
96800	96806	96808	96808	Wogan	109	" It is not enough , "
96810	96844	96808	96808	Wogan	109	" for the King lingers in Spain , and the portrait of Maria Vittoria glows on the walls of the Caprara Palace , whither I was bidden to escort her Highness this morning . "
96865	97094	96859	96859	his	430	" I will tell you the truth of the matter , Mr. Wogan . The King saw Mlle . de Caprara for the first time while you were searching Europe for a wife for him . He saw her here one morning at Mass in the Church of the Crucifixion , and came away most silent . Of their acquaintance I need not speak . The King just for one month became an ardent youth . He appealed to the Pope for his consent to marry Mlle . de Caprara , and the Pope consented . The King was just sending off a message to bid you cease your search when you came back with the news that her Highness the Princess Clementina had accepted the King 's hand and would shortly set out for Bologna . Sir , the King was in despair , though he showed to you a smiling , grateful face . Mlle . de Caprara went to Rome ; the King stayed here awaiting his betrothed . There came the news of her imprisonment . The King , after all , is a man . If his heart leaped a little at the news , who shall blame him ? Do you remember how you came privately one night to the King 's cabinet and found me there in the King 's company ? "
97095	97098	97100	97100	Wogan	109	" But , "
97102	97119	97100	97100	Wogan	109	" I do remember that evening . I remember that the King was pale , discouraged — "
97120	97124	97126	97126	Origo	122	" And why ? "
97128	97241	97126	97126	Origo	122	" Because her Highness 's journey had been interrupted , because the marriage now seemed impossible ? No , but because Mr. Charles Wogan was back in Bologna , because Mr. Charles Wogan had sought for a private interview , because the King had no more doubt than I as to what Mr. Charles Wogan intended to propose , and because the King knew that what Mr. Wogan set his hand to was as good as done . You remember I threw such hindrances as I could in your way , and made much of the risks you must run , and the impossibility of your task . Now you know why . "
97258	97268	97269	97269	he	109	" It makes me out a mere meddlesome fool , "
97276	97288	97290	97291	the Cardinal	430	" It is an unprofitable question at this time of day , "
97297	97317	97290	97291	the Cardinal	430	" Matters have gone so far that they can no longer be remedied . This marriage must take place . "
97318	97321	97323	97323	Wogan	109	" True , "
97325	97337	97323	97323	Wogan	109	" The King , indeed , is firmly inclined to it . "
97338	97345	97290	97291	the Cardinal	430	" Yet he lingers in Spain . "
97346	97375	97290	97291	the Cardinal	430	" That I can not explain to you , but he has been most loyal . That you must take my word for , so must your Princess . "
97376	97391	97392	97392	Wogan	109	" Yet this winter when I was at Schlestadt preparing the expedition to Innspruck , "
97414	97426	97400	97400	he	109	" the King was in Rome visiting Mlle . de Caprara . "
97438	97443	97445	97445	he	430	" Come , sir , "
97447	97607	97445	97445	he	430	" what has soured you with suspicions ? Upon my word , here is a man sitting with me who bears your name , but few of those good qualities the name is linked with in my memories . Your King saw Mlle . de Caprara once in Rome , once only . Major Gaydon had come at your request to Rome to fetch a letter in the King 's hand , bidding her Highness entrust herself to you . Up to that moment the issue of your exploit was in the balance . But your request was to the King a very certain sign that you would indeed succeed . So the night before he wrote the letter he went to the Caprara Palace and took his farewell of the woman he loved . So much may be pardoned to any man , even by you , who , it seems , stand pinnacled above these earthly affections . "
97635	97643	97645	97646	the Cardinal	430	" This story I have told you , "
97648	97662	97645	97646	the Cardinal	430	" I will make bold to tell to - morrow to her Highness . "
97663	97676	97677	97677	Wogan	109	" But you must also explain why the King lingers in Spain , "
97680	97702	97677	97677	Wogan	109	" I am very certain of it . The Princess has her pride ; she will not marry a reluctant man . "
97703	97712	97714	97715	the Cardinal	430	" Well , that I can not do , "
97721	97748	97714	97715	the Cardinal	430	" Pride ! She has her pride ! Is it to ruin a cause , this pride of hers ? Is it to wreck a policy ? "
97749	97752	97754	97754	Wogan	109	" No , "
97759	97813	97754	97754	Wogan	109	" I have a fortnight . I beg your Eminence not to speak one word to her Highness until this fortnight is gone , until the eve of the marriage in Bologna . Give me till then . I have a hope there will be no need for us to speak at all . "
97820	97836	97817	97817	his	430	" You must do more than hope . Will you pledge your word to it ? "
97851	97854	97855	97855	he	109	" Yes , "
97946	97955	97957	97957	Wogan	109	" I am to go on a journey , "
97959	97974	97957	97957	Wogan	109	" and there 's a delicate sort of work I would trust to you . "
97981	97984	97986	97986	he	109	" Opus , "
97995	98011	97986	97986	he	109	" I want you to keep an eye on the little house in the garden — "
98015	98022	98024	98024	he	109	" Hortus , hortus , hortum , "
98026	98031	98033	98033	he	109	" horti — hortus , "
98041	98096	98033	98033	he	109	" no , horti , horto , horto . Do you know , my friend , that the difference between the second and fourth declensions was solely invented by the grammarians for their own profit . It is of no manner of use , and the most plaguy business that ever I heard of . "
98097	98100	98102	98102	Wogan	109	" O'Toole , "
98111	98123	98102	98102	Wogan	109	" you are no more listening to me than this table . "
98141	98154	98137	98137	he	109	" Mensa , mensa , mensam , mensae , mensae , mensa . "
98162	98199	98155	98155	Wogan	109	" Do n't mensa , mensam me when I am talking most seriously to you ! What is it you are after ? What 's that book you are hiding ? Let me look at it ! "
98215	98225	98227	98227	he	109	" It 's a Latin grammar , my friend , "
98231	98260	98227	98227	he	109	" And what in the world do you want to be addling your brains with a Latin grammar for , when there 's other need for your eyes ? "
98261	98298	98155	98155	Wogan	109	" Are n't we to be enrolled at the Capitol in June as Roman Senators with all the ancient honours , cum titubis — it is so — cum titubis , which are psalters or pshawms ? "
98299	98305	98227	98227	he	109	" Well , what then ? "
98306	98398	98400	98400	O'Toole	158	" You do n't understand , Charles , the difficulty of my position . You have Latin at your finger - ends . Sure , I have often admired you for your extraordinary comprehension of Latin , but never more than I do now . It will be no trouble in the world for you to trip off a neat little speech , thanking the Senators kindly for the great honour they are doing themselves in electing us into their noble body . But it will not be easy for me , "
98406	98423	98424	98424	He	158	" How can I get enough Latin through my skull by June not to disgrace myself ? "
98440	98484	98432	98432	Wogan	109	" I sit up at nights with a lamp , but the most unaccountable thing happens . I may come in here as lively as any cricket , but the moment I take this book in my hands I am overpowered with sleep — "
98485	98492	98494	98494	Wogan	109	" Oh , listen to me , "
98496	98503	98494	98494	Wogan	109	" I have only a fortnight — "
98504	98512	98514	98514	O'Toole	158	" And I have only till June , "
98516	98540	98541	98541	he	158	" But there ! I am listening . I have no doubt , my friend , your business is more important than mine , "
98563	98567	98568	98568	he	158	" My business , "
98571	98630	98568	98568	he	158	" is only more important because you have no need of your Latin grammar at all . There 's a special deputy , a learned professor , appointed on these occasions to make a speech for us , and all we have to do is to sit still and nod our heads wisely when he looks towards us . "
98631	98636	98638	98638	O'Toole	158	" Is that all ? "
98643	98647	98638	98638	O'Toole	158	" Swear it ! "
98648	98652	98654	98654	Wogan	109	" I do , "
98657	98668	98670	98670	O'Toole	158	" Here 's to the devil with the Latin grammar ! "
98714	98727	98728	98728	he	158	" Now what will I do for you in return for this ? "
98731	98776	98728	98728	he	158	" Keep a watch on the little house and the garden . I will tell you why when I return . Observe who goes in to visit the Princess , but hinder no one . Only remember who they are and let me know . "
98904	98913	98896	98896	she	164	" Send him away ! I hate him . "
98958	98965	98955	98955	she	164	" Let him up to me ! "
99029	99033	99035	99035	she	164	" Your business , "
99071	99080	99081	99081	she	164	" And why should I travel to Bologna ? "
99132	99156	99158	99158	Mlle	204	" Why should I trouble because the Princess Clementina has a crumpled rose - leaf in her bed ? I will not go , "
99163	99177	99158	99158	Mlle	204	" Yet her Highness may justly ask why the King lingers in Spain . "
99197	99209	99211	99212	Maria Vittoria	164	" It is no doubt a humiliation to the Princess Clementina , "
99221	99233	99211	99212	Maria Vittoria	164	" But she must learn to bear humiliation like other women . "
99234	99242	99244	99244	Wogan	109	" But she will reject the marriage , "
99246	99250	99252	99253	Maria Vittoria	164	" The fool ! "
99261	99297	99256	99256	she	164	" I will not budge an inch to persuade her to it . Let her fancy what she will and weep over it ! I hate her ; therefore she is out of my thought . "
99327	99467	99322	99322	he	109	" No doubt you think me something of a fool , too , to advance so unlikely a plea . But if her Highness rejects the marriage , who suffers ? Her Highness 's name is already widely praised for her endurance , her constancy . If , after all , at the last moment she scornfully rejects that for which she has so stoutly ventured , whose name , whose cause , will suffer most ? It will be one more misfortune , one more disaster , to add to the crushing weight under which the King labours . There will be ignominy ; who will be dwarfed by it ? There will be laughter ; whom will it souse ? There will be scandal ; who will be splashed by it ? The Princess or the King ? "
99480	99486	99487	99487	she	164	" I will not go , "
99493	99508	99487	99487	she	164	" Never was there so presumptuous a request . No , I will not . "
99549	99560	99561	99561	she	164	" What should I say if I went with you ? "
99564	99575	99561	99561	she	164	" You would say why the King lingers in Spain . "
99585	99591	99576	99577	Maria Vittoria	164	" Do you know why ? "
99592	99598	99576	99577	Maria Vittoria	164	" You told me yesterday . "
99599	99604	99576	99577	Maria Vittoria	164	" Not in words . "
99605	99613	99576	99577	Maria Vittoria	164	" There are other ways of speech . "
99637	99650	99652	99655	Mlle . de Caprara	204	" How will my story , though I told it , help ? "
99751	99756	99758	99758	Wogan	109	" Tell the story , "
99760	99767	99758	99758	Wogan	109	" I will warrant the result . "
99768	99776	99778	99778	she	116	" No , I will not go , "
99795	99801	99803	99804	Maria Vittoria	164	" Why should I go ? "
99808	99868	99803	99804	Maria Vittoria	164	" Say what you have said to me to her ! Speak to her of the ignominy which will befall the King ! Tell her how his cause will totter ! Why talk of this to me ? If she loves the King , your words will persuade her . For on my life they have nearly persuaded me . "
99869	99876	99878	99878	Wogan	109	" If she loves the King ! "
99898	99907	99908	99908	she	164	" Oh , she does not love him ! "
99920	99954	99913	99913	Her	164	" The fool ! Let her go on her knees and pray for a modest heart . There 's my message to her . Who is she that she should not love him ? "
100041	100055	100056	100056	she	164	" I have a mind to see this fool - woman of yours , "
100060	100069	100056	100056	she	164	" Why does she not love the King ? "
100100	100109	100110	100110	she	164	" Is there another picture at her heart ? "
100119	100130	100115	100115	Wogan	109	" Whose , then ? You will not tell me . "
100191	100200	100201	100201	she	164	" I will go with you to Bologna , "
100341	100349	100351	100351	he	158	" There has been no mysterious visitor , "
100353	100362	100364	100364	Wogan	109	" There will be one to - night , "
100366	100372	100364	100364	Wogan	109	" I shall need you . "
100373	100378	100380	100380	O'Toole	158	" I am ready , "
100422	100428	100430	100430	he	109	" Let no one pass , "
100432	100437	100438	100438	He	109	" till we return . "
100480	100491	100493	100493	Wogan	109	" I come with a message of the utmost importance , "
100495	100514	100493	100493	Wogan	109	" I beg you to inform her Highness that the Chevalier Wogan prays for two words with her . "
100657	100663	100664	100664	he	167	" You will be friendly , "
100671	100824	100664	100664	he	167	" Oh , you can not but be ! She must marry the King . I plead for him , not the least bit in the world for her . For his sake she must complete the work she has begun . She is not obstinate ; she has her pride as a woman should . You will tell her just the truth,—of the King 's loyalty and yours . Hearts can not be commanded . Alas , mademoiselle , it is a hard world at the end of it . It is mortised with the blood of broken hearts . But duty , mademoiselle , duty , a consciousness of rectitude,—these are very noble qualities . It will be a high consolation , mademoiselle , one of these days , when the King sits upon his throne in England , to think that your self - sacrifice had set him there . "
100930	100934	100936	100936	he	167	" Your Highness , "
100938	100953	100936	100936	he	167	" I have the honour to present to you the Princess Maria Vittoria Caprara . "
101470	101481	101482	101482	he	158	" The little fellows thought to catch Charles Wogan napping , "
101566	101576	101578	101578	he	1056	" You stand in my way , my friend , "
101634	101640	101642	101642	he	365	" I wish to enter , "
101644	101650	101642	101642	he	365	" I have important business . "
101658	101663	101665	101665	he	365	" Romanus civis sum , "
101667	101679	101680	101680	O'Toole	158	" Sum senator too . Dic Latinam linguam , amicus meus . "
101735	101748	101750	101750	he	158	" Here 's tomfoolery that would be as seasonable at a funeral , "
101762	101783	101753	101753	he	158	" Sir , you are blocking my way . I have authority to pass through that door in the wall . "
101784	101787	101789	101789	O'Toole	158	" Murus ? "
101798	101808	101791	101791	He	158	" And by what right do you refuse me ? "
101828	101833	101835	101835	he	158	" Balbus aedificabat murum , "
101846	101859	101842	101842	O'Toole	158	" Enough of this ! Stand aside , whoever you may be . "
101880	101884	101889	101889	he	158	" The King ! "
101932	101943	101945	101946	the Chevalier	348	" Who , in Heaven 's name , are you ? "
101948	101960	101962	101962	Wogan	109	" Nay , there 's a question for me to ask , "
101964	101967	101969	101970	the Chevalier	348	" Wogan ! "
101973	101977	101979	101979	Wogan	109	" The King ! "
101997	102027	102028	102028	he	348	" So it is true . I could not , did not , believe it . I came from Spain to prove it false . I find it true , "
102035	102053	102028	102028	he	348	" You whom I so trusted ! God help me , where shall I look for honour ? "
102054	102060	102062	102062	Wogan	109	" Here , your Majesty , "
102068	102081	102082	102082	He	109	hesitation,—"here , in this hall . There , in the rooms above . "
102139	102181	102134	102135	The Chevalier	348	" Sir , I suspect honour which needs such barriers to protect it . You are here , in this house , at this hour , with a sentinel to forbid intrusion at the garden door . Explain me this honourably . "
102182	102206	102219	102220	the Chevalier	348	" I had the honour to escort a visitor to her Highness , and I wait until the visit is at an end . "
102207	102217	102219	102220	the Chevalier	348	" What ? Can you not better that excuse ? "
102222	102248	102250	102250	he	348	" A visitor ! We will make acquaintance , Mr. Wogan , with your visitor , unless you have another sentinel to bar my way ; "
102261	102269	102271	102271	Wogan	109	" I beg your Majesty to pause , "
102275	102286	102271	102271	Wogan	109	" Your thoughts wrong me , and not only me . "
102287	102292	102219	102220	the Chevalier	348	" Prove me that ! "
102293	102312	102271	102271	Wogan	109	" I say boldly , ' Here is a servant who loves his Queen ! ' What then ? "
102313	102350	102219	102220	the Chevalier	348	" This ! That you should say , ' Here is a man who loves a woman,—loves her so well he gives his friends the slip , and with the woman comes alone to Peri . ' "
102351	102361	102363	102363	Wogan	109	" Ah . To Peri ! So I thought , "
102371	102417	102419	102419	he	109	" Silence ! You raise your voice too high . You no doubt are anxious in your great respect that there should be some intimation of my coming . But I dispense with ceremony . I will meet this fine visitor of yours at once ; "
102454	102465	102466	102466	he	109	" Sir , I beg you to listen to me , "
102470	102473	102475	102476	the Chevalier	348	" Beg ! "
102493	102497	102484	102484	his	348	" you insist . "
102498	102509	102510	102510	He	348	" Your Majesty will yet thank me for my insistence . "
102521	102588	102510	102510	He	348	" At Peri in Italy we were attacked by five soldiers sent over the border by the Governor of Trent . Who guided those five soldiers ? Your Majesty 's confidant and friend , who is now , I thank God , waiting in the garden . Here is the written confession of the leader of the five . I pray your Majesty to read it . "
102621	102627	102629	102629	he	167	" Whom shall I trust ? "
102637	102647	102649	102649	Wogan	167	" What honest errand was taking Whittington to Peri ? "
102670	102716	102718	102718	he	167	" Whittington is not the only one of Walpole 's men who has hoodwinked us the while he filled his pockets . There are others , one , at all events , who did not need to travel to Spain for an ear to poison ; "
102725	102731	102733	102734	the Chevalier	348	" What do you mean ? "
102741	102814	102733	102734	the Chevalier	348	" Why , sir , that the same sort of venomous story breathed to you in Spain has been spoken here in Bologna , only with altered names . I told your Majesty I brought a visitor to this house to - night . I did ; there was no need I should , since the marriage is fixed for to - morrow . I brought her all the way from Rome . "
102815	102819	102821	102822	the Chevalier	348	" From Rome ? "
102824	102827	102821	102822	the Chevalier	348	" Yes ; "
102848	102852	102844	102844	his	167	" The King ! "
102918	102979	102914	102914	She	164	" Your Majesty , a long while ago , when you bade me farewell , I demanded of you a promise , which I have but this moment explained to the Princess , who now deigns to call me friend . Your Majesty has broken the promise . I had no right to demand it . I am very glad . "
103084	103089	103091	103092	the Chevalier	348	" Who is it ? "
103106	103110	103103	103103	Wogan	167	" And Whittington ? "
103111	103116	103118	103118	Wogan	167	" He has gone , "
103120	103127	103118	103118	Wogan	167	" You have sent him away ? "
103128	103136	103137	103138	The Chevalier	348	" I took so much upon myself . "
103146	103155	103157	103157	he	348	" I have good reason to thank you , "
103245	103272	103242	103242	she	164	" I wish you , my lord , all happiness , and the boon of a great love . With all my heart I wish it ; "
103289	103299	103300	103300	she	164	" I will bid you farewell to - morrow , "
103321	103372	103300	103300	she	164	" Mlle . de Caprara will honour us with her presence to - morrow . You will still act as my proxy , Wogan . I am not yet returned from Spain . I wish no questions or talk about this evening 's doings . Your friend will remember that ? "
103373	103379	103381	103381	Wogan	167	" My friend , sir , "
103383	103400	103381	103381	Wogan	167	" who was with me at Innspruck , is Captain Lucius O'Toole of Dillon 's regiment . "
103401	103406	103408	103409	the Chevalier	348	" Et senator too , "
103449	103458	103460	103460	O'Toole	158	" But you will come up with me , "
103462	103488	103460	103460	O'Toole	158	" We will drink a glass together , for God knows when we speak together again . I go back to Schlestadt to - morrow . "
103489	103496	103498	103498	Wogan	126	" Ah , you go back , "
103519	103525	103516	103516	he	126	" Let me rouse Gaydon . "
103526	103533	103460	103460	O'Toole	158	" Gaydon went three days ago . "
103534	103567	103569	103569	he	126	" Ah ! And Misset is with his wife . Here are we all once more scattered , and , as you say , God knows when we shall speak together again ; "
103598	103602	103604	103604	he	126	" My friend , "
103606	103636	103604	103604	he	126	" you have the black fit upon you ; you are plainly discouraged . Yet to - night sees the labour of many months brought to its due close ; "
103720	103723	103725	103725	Wogan	126	" True , "
103727	103789	103791	103791	he	126	" the work ends to - night . Months ago I rode down this street in the early morning , and with what high hopes ! The work ends to - night , and may God forgive me for a meddlesome fellow . Cup and ball 's a fine game , but it is ill playing it with women 's hearts ; "
103796	103813	103791	103791	he	126	" I 'll give you a toast , Lucius ! Here 's to the Princess Clementina ! "
103871	103887	103889	103889	O'Toole	158	" To the Princess — no , to the Queen she was born to be , "
103897	103902	103903	103903	he	126	" You saw that , "
103922	103996	103903	103903	he	126	" Aye,—to love a nation,—that is her high destiny . For others , a husband , a man ; for her , a nation . And you saw it ! It is evident , to be sure . Yet this or that thing she did , this or that word she spoke , assured you , eh ? Tell me what proved to you here was no mere woman , but a queen ! "
104043	104052	104053	104053	he	126	" There 's another piece of good news , "
104059	104129	104053	104053	he	126	" which I had almost forgotten to tell you . Jenny and the Princess 's mother are happily set free . It seems Jenny swore from daybreak to daybreak , and the Pope used his kindliest offices , and for those two reasons the Emperor was glad to let them go . But there 's a question I would like to ask you . One little matter puzzles me . "
104130	104135	104137	104137	Wogan	126	" Ask your question , "
104139	104187	104137	104137	Wogan	126	" To - night through that door in the garden wall which I guarded , there went in yourself and a lady,—the King and a companion he had with him,—four people . Out of that door there came yourself , the lady , and the King,—three people . "
104188	104191	104193	104193	Wogan	126	" Ah , "
104207	104218	104196	104196	he	126	" I have a deal of clay upon my clothes . "
104228	104233	104234	104234	he	126	" I am answered , "
104237	104243	104234	104234	he	126	" Is it indeed so ? "
104504	104507	104498	104498	she	3107	" Yes , "
104557	104559	104498	104498	she	3107	" Yes "
104632	104634	104624	104624	They	1054	" fate "
104636	104638	104624	104624	They	1054	" destiny "
104864	104874	104876	104876	she	164	" I came to see a fool - woman , "
104878	104891	104893	104893	she	164	" and I saw a fool - man . Well , well ! "
104903	104921	104893	104893	she	164	" Why , oh , why did you not take your fortunes in your hands at Peri ? "
104928	104935	104922	104922	Wogan	109	" Do you know so much ? "
104941	104953	104954	104954	She	164	" I will never forgive you . Yes , I know . "
104962	104975	104956	104956	her	164	" I suppose you are content . You have your black horse . "
104976	104985	104987	104987	Wogan	109	" You know of the horse , too , "
104997	105008	104987	104987	Wogan	109	" You know I have no further use for it . "
105009	105022	104956	104956	her	164	" Say that again , and I will beg it of you . "
105023	105041	104956	104956	her	164	" Nay , it is yours , then . I will send him after you to Rome . "
105042	105046	105048	105049	Maria Vittoria	164	" Will you ? "
105051	105064	105066	105066	she	164	" Why , then , I accept . There 's my hand ; "
105075	105135	105066	105066	she	164	" If ever you come to Rome , the Caprara Palace stands where it did at your last visit . I do not say you will be welcome . No , I do not forgive you , but you may come . Having your horse , I could hardly bar the door against you . So you may come . "
105144	105147	105149	105149	she	164	" Aye , "
105157	105200	105149	105149	she	164	" kiss my hand . You have had your way . Here are two people crossmated , and two others not mated at all . You have made four people entirely unhappy , and a kiss on the glove sets all right . "
105201	105207	105209	105209	Wogan	109	" Nay , not four , "
105211	105215	105216	105216	she	164	" Your manners , "
105228	105247	105216	105216	she	164	" will hinder you from telling me to my face the King is happy . And the Princess ? "
105248	105257	105259	105259	Wogan	109	" She was born to be a queen , "
105263	105335	105259	105259	Wogan	109	" Happiness , mademoiselle ! It does not come by the striving after it . That 's the royal road to miss it . You may build up your house of happiness with all your care through years , and you will find you have only built it up to draw down the blinds and hang out the hatchment above the door , for the tenant to inhabit it is dead . "
105355	105406	105349	105349	she	164	" That is very fine , moral , and poetical . Your Princess was born to be a queen . But what if her throne is set up only in your city of dreams ? Well , it is some consolation to know that you are one of the four . "
105407	105427	105349	105349	she	164	" Nay , I will make a shift not to plague myself upon the way the world treats you . "
105428	105438	105440	105440	she	164	" Ah , but because it treats you well , "
105442	105493	105495	105495	she	164	" There will be work for you , hurryings to and fro , the opportunities of excelling , nights in the saddle , and perhaps again the quick red life of battlefields . It is well with you , but what of me , Mr. Wogan ? What of me ? "
105751	105754	105755	105755	she	134	" Well ? "
105774	105802	105803	105803	He	109	" Your Ladyship was wise , I think , to leave Bologna . The little house in the trees there had no such wide prospect as this . "
105856	105866	105868	105868	Wogan	109	" I am not the visitor whom you expect , "
105870	105884	105868	105868	Wogan	109	" nor do I bring the news which you would wish to hear ; "
105894	105913	105888	105888	she	134	" I beg you — a moment 's silence . Then I will hear you , Mr. Warner . "
106021	106026	106018	106018	she	134	" Now your news ; "
106041	106051	106053	106053	Wogan	109	" The King married this morning the Princess Clementina , "
106128	106148	106124	106124	He	109	" Last night Mr. Whittington came with the King to Bologna — you understand , no doubt , why ; "
106196	106366	106193	106193	She	134	" The King and Mr. Whittington came at nine of the night to the little house which you once occupied . I was there , but I was not there alone . Can your Ladyship conjecture whom I brought there ? Your Ladyship , as I learned last night from Mr. Whittington 's own lips , had paid a visit secretly , using a key which you had retained to the house on an excuse that you had left behind jewels of some value . You saw her Highness the Princess . You told her a story of the King and Mlle . de Caprara . I rode to Rome , and when the King came last night Mlle . de Caprara was with the Princess . I had evidence against Mr. Whittington , a confession of one of the soldiers of the Governor of Trent , the leader of a party of five who attacked me at Peri . No doubt you know of that little matter too ; "
106373	106397	106369	106370	Lady Featherstone	134	" Thus your double plot — to set the King against the Princess , and the Princess against the King — doubly failed . "
106398	106402	106404	106405	Lady Featherstone	134	" Go on , "
106456	106463	106464	106464	he	109	" I went into the garden , "
106468	106513	106464	106464	he	109	" and touched Whittington on the elbow . I told him just what I have explained to you . I said , ' You are a coward , a liar , a slanderer of women , ' and I beat him on the mouth . "
106568	106572	106573	106573	she	134	" Go on , "
106576	106580	106573	106573	she	134	" and he ? "
106581	106675	106682	106683	Lady Featherstone	134	" He answered me in the strangest quiet way imaginable . ' You insulted Lady Featherstone at Ohlau , Mr. Wogan , ' said he , ' one evening when she hid behind your curtain . It was a very delicate piece of drollery , no doubt . But I shall be glad to show you another , view of it . ' It is strange how that had rankled in his thoughts . I liked him for it,—upon my soul , I did,—though it was the only thing I liked in him . "
106676	106680	106682	106683	Lady Featherstone	134	" Go on , "
106709	106834	106682	106683	Lady Featherstone	134	" We went to the bottom of the garden where there is a little square of lawn hedged in with myrtle - trees . The night was very dark , so we stripped to our shirts . From the waist upwards we were visible to each other as a vague glimmer of white , and thus we fought , foot to foot , among the myrtle - trees . We could not see so much as our swords unless they clashed more than usually hard , and a spark struck from them . We fought by guesswork and feel , and in the end luck served me . I drove my sword through his chest until the hilt rang upon his breast - bone . "
106852	106919	106844	106844	she	134	" He lived for perhaps five minutes . He was in great distress lest harm should come to you ; and since there was no one but his enemy to whom he could speak , why , he spoke to his enemy . I promised him , madam , that with his death the story should be closed , if you left Italy within the week . "
106920	106924	106925	106925	she	134	" And he ? "
106926	106932	106844	106844	she	134	interrupted,—"he died there . Well ? "
106933	106973	106925	106925	she	134	" You know the laurel hedge by the sun - dial ? There is an out - house where the gardener keeps his tools . I found a spade there , and beneath that laurel hedge I buried him . "
107063	107068	107070	107070	he	109	" She could love , "
107072	107079	107070	107070	he	109	" yes , she could love . "
107135	107144	107146	107146	she	134	" Here are two people cross - mated , "
107430	107433	107438	107438	she	116	" wasted , "
