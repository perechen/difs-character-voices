613	624	626	627	a lady	288	" And can you direct me , my good boy , "
641	660	626	627	a lady	288	" to the residence of Mrs. Fortescue , it is out of the village , is it not ? "
661	665	667	668	the boy	290	" Mrs. Fortescue ! "
1866	1885	1854	1855	the child	346	" Dear mamma , shall I call widow Morgan , or can I get any thing for you ? "
1933	1981	1923	1924	Mrs. Fortescue	73	" He has gone down to the stream to launch his little frigate , mamma , and asked me to fasten these buttons on his jacket , to make it look like a sailor 's meanwhile ; I do not think he will be very long now . "
2021	2053	2012	2012	her	348	" But why should you fear so much for Edward , dear mamma ? Every body loves him and admires him , so I am sure my aunt and uncle will . "
2054	2145	1982	1983	Mrs. Fortescue	73	" Your aunt may for my sake , but she will not love or bear with his childish faults as I have done ; and your uncle is such a harsh , stern man , that there is little hope for his forbearance with my poor Edward . And he is so frank and bold , he will not know how even to conceal his boyish errors , and he will be punished , and his fine spirit broken , and who will be there to shield and soothe him ! "
2146	2166	2168	2169	her child	350	" I may be able sometimes , mamma , and indeed , indeed , I will whenever I can , "
2175	2210	2168	2169	her child	350	" I love him so very , very much , and I know he is so much better than I am , that it will be very easy to help him whenever I can . "
2211	2240	2242	2243	Mrs. Fortescue	73	" Will you promise me , Ellen , will you really promise me to shield him , and save him from harshness whenever it is in your power , "
2597	2606	2617	2617	Edward	76	" Joy , joy ! Mother , darling ! "
2640	2710	2617	2617	Edward	76	" Such joy ! My ship sailed so beautifully , I quite longed for you to see it , and you will one day when you get well and strong again ; and I know you will soon now , for I am sure aunt Emmeline will very soon come , and then , then , you will be so happy , and we shall all be happy again ! "
2741	2776	2806	2806	she	330	" Do n't cry , mamma , dear ! indeed , indeed , my aunt will soon come . Do you know I think I have seen her and spoken to her , too ? "
2777	2799	2806	2806	she	330	" Seen her , Edward ? You mean you have dreamed about her , and so fancy you have seen her ; "
2817	2867	2806	2806	she	330	" No , no , mamma ; as we were watching my ship , a carriage passed us , and a lady spoke to me , and asked me the way to the cottage where you lived , and I am sure it is aunt Emmeline from her smile . "
2868	2874	2876	2877	his mother	330	" It can not be , "
2881	2884	2886	2886	her	330	" unless — "
2890	2914	2886	2886	her	330	" Did she speak to you , Edward , as if she knew you , recognized you , from your likeness to me ? "
2915	2947	2949	2949	he	76	" No , mamma , there was no time , the carriage drove off again so quickly ; but , hush ! I am sure I hear her voice down stairs , "
2959	2994	2995	2995	he	76	" Yes , yes , I am right , and she is coming up ; no , it 's only widow Morgan , but I am sure it is my aunt by your face , "
3021	3031	3044	3044	he	76	" Why do n't you let her come up ? "
3062	3105	3044	3044	he	76	" You are my aunt , my own dear aunt ; do come up to mamma , she has been wanting you so long , so very long , and you will make her well , dear aunt , will you not ? "
3106	3121	3129	3129	she	291	" Oh , that I may be allowed to do so , dear boy ! "
3361	3423	3335	3335	Her	365	" My father ! my father ! Oh , Emmeline I know that he is dead ! My disobedience , my ingratitude for all his too indulgent love , killed him — I know it did . But did he curse me , Emmeline ? did all his love turn to wrath , as it ought to have done ? did — "
3424	3428	3430	3431	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Dearest Eleanor , "
3437	3509	3510	3510	she	371	" dismiss such painful thoughts at once ; our poor father did feel your conduct deeply , but he forgave it , would have received your husband , caressed , loved you as before , had you but returned to him ; and so loved you to the last moment , that your name was the last word upon his lips . But this is no subject for such youthful auditors , "
3539	3547	3548	3548	she	371	" You look weary , my love , "
3564	3617	3548	3548	she	371	" Edward has made his own acquaintance with me , why did you not do so too ? But go now into the garden for a little while , I am sure you want fresh air , and I will take your place as nurse mean while . Will you trust me ? "
4238	4264	4223	4223	she	113	" Dear Ellen , what is the matter ? What has happened to grieve you so to - day ? wo n't you tell me ? "
4265	4309	4323	4327	a fine lad of sixteen	402	" Indeed , indeed , I do not know , dear Arthur ; I only feel — feel — as if I had not so much strength as I had a few days ago — and , and I could not help crying . "
4310	4318	4320	4321	her companion	401	" You are not well , Ellen , "
4336	4386	4330	4331	Mr. Myrvin	74	" You are looking paler than I ever saw you before ; let me call my father . You know he is always pleased when he sees you , and he hoped you would have been to us before to - day ; come with me to him now . "
4387	4440	4447	4447	her	404	" No , Arthur , indeed I can not ; he will think I have forgotten all he said to me the last time I saw him , and , indeed , I have not — but I — I do not know what is the matter with me to - day . "
4492	4500	4501	4501	he	406	" In tears , my dear Ellen ! "
4506	4516	4501	4501	he	406	" your mother is not worse , I hope ? "
4517	4525	4527	4528	the child	346	" I do not know , sir , "
4538	4555	4501	4501	he	406	" she has been very ill just now , for her faint was longer than usual . "
4556	4564	4611	4611	he	406	" Did any thing particular occasion it ? "
4565	4583	4611	4611	he	406	" I think it was seeing my aunt . Mamma was very much agitated before and afterward . "
4584	4598	4600	4601	Mr. Myrvin	74	" Mrs. Hamilton has arrived then ! I am rejoiced to hear it , "
4625	4770	4611	4611	he	406	" Something has grieved my little girl this evening ; I will not ask what it is , because you may not like to tell me ; but you must not imagine evils , Ellen . I know you have done , and are doing , the duty of a good , affectionate child , nursing your suffering mother , bearing with intervals of impatience , which her invalid state occasions , and giving up all your own wishes to sit quietly by her . I have not seen you , my child , but I know those who have , and this has pleased me , and , what is of much more consequence , it proves you have not forgotten all I told you of your Father in Heaven , that even a little child can try to love and serve Him . "
4771	4786	4788	4788	Ellen	113	" But have you not told me those who are good are always happy ? "
4790	4828	4788	4788	Ellen	113	" then I can not be good , though indeed I try to be so , for I do not think I am happy , for I can never laugh and sing and talk as Edward does . "
4829	5057	4611	4611	he	406	" You are not in such strong health as your brother , my dear little girl , and you have had many things to make you unhappy , which Edward has not . But you must try and remember that even if it please God that sometimes you should be more sorrowful than other children , He loves you notwithstanding . I am sure you have not forgotten the story of Joseph that I told you a few Sundays ago . God so loved him , as to give him the power of foretelling future events , and enabling him to do a great deal of good , but when he was taken away from his father and sold as a slave and cast into prison among cruel strangers , he could not have been very happy , Ellen . Yet still , young as he was , little more than a child in those days , and thrown among those who did not know right from wrong , he remembered all that his father had taught him , and prayed to God , and tried to love and obey Him ; and God was pleased with him , and gave him grace to continue good , and at last so blessed him , as to permit him to see his dear father and darling brother again . "
5058	5068	5070	5070	Ellen	113	" But Joseph was his father 's favorite child , "
5097	5109	4788	4788	Ellen	113	" He must have been happy when he thought of that . "
5110	5121	5129	5129	he	74	" I do not think so , my dear Ellen , "
5134	5313	5129	5129	he	74	" for being his father 's favorite first excited the dislike and envy of his brothers , and caused them to wish to send him away . There was no excuse indeed for their conduct ; but perhaps if Joseph had always remained near his father he might have been spoiled by too great indulgence , and never become as good as he afterward was . Perhaps in his solitary prison he might even have regretted that his father had not treated them all alike , as then the angry feelings of his brothers would not have been called forth . So you see , being a favorite will not always make us happy , Ellen . It is indeed very delightful to be loved and caressed , and if we try to do our duty and love as much as we can , even if we are not sure of being loved at first , we may be quite certain that we shall be loved and happy at last . Do you understand me , my child ? "
5351	5360	5361	5361	she	113	" Then do you think mamma will recover ? "
5365	5386	5361	5361	she	113	" will she ever love me?—oh , if I thought so , I could never , never be naughty again ! "
5387	5397	5399	5400	Mr. Myrvin	74	" She will love you , my dear Ellen , "
5406	5471	5399	5400	Mr. Myrvin	74	" I can not , I dare not tell you that she will recover to love you on earth , but if indeed it be God 's will that she should go to Him , she will look down on you from Heaven and love you far more than she has done yet , for she will know then how much you love her . "
5472	5491	5493	5493	Ellen	113	" And will she know if I do all she wishes — if I love and help Edward ? "
5525	5587	5588	5588	he	74	" It is a question none can answer positively , Ellen , but it is my own firm belief , that the beloved ones we have lost are permitted to watch over and love us still , and that they see us , and are often near us , though we can not see them . But even to help Edward , "
5593	5600	5588	5588	he	74	" you must not be tempted — "
5651	5668	5632	5633	Mr. Myrvin	74	" And my name is Hamilton , so I think I have an uncle 's privilege , "
6083	6096	6099	6099	her	113	" Ah , you and Emmeline will find much to converse about , "
6113	6161	6178	6178	her	113	" Talk as much as you please , and do not mind me . With Emmeline near me , I can restrain irritability which must have frightened you away . I know she is right . Oh , would to God I had always been like her ! "
6325	6338	6339	6340	his mother	330	" He will repay you for all your care , dearest Emmeline , "
6354	6392	6339	6340	his mother	330	" I know he has what you and your husband will think faults , but , oh , for my sake , do not treat him harshly ; his noble spirit will be broken if you do ! "
6393	6447	6339	6340	his mother	330	" Dearest Eleanor , dismiss all such fears . Am I not a mother equally with yourself ? and do you think when your children become mine I shall show any difference between them and my own ? You would trust me even in former years , surely you will trust me now ? "
6448	6492	6339	6340	his mother	330	" Indeed , indeed , I do ; you were always kind and forbearing with me , when I little deserved it . But my poor Edward , it is so hard to part with him , and he loves me so fondly ! "
6503	6571	6339	6340	his mother	330	" And he shall continue to love you dearest Eleanor ; and oh , believe me , all that you have been to him I will be . I have won the devoted affection of all my own darlings , and I do not fear to gain the love of yours ; and then it will be an easy task to make them happy as my own . "
6572	6608	6339	6340	his mother	330	" Edward 's love you will very quickly obtain , if it be not yours already ; but Ellen you will have more trouble with . She is a strange , cold , unlovable child . "
6609	6644	6339	6340	his mother	330	" Are the dispositions of your children so unlike ? I should not have fancied Ellen cold ; she is timid , but that I thought would wear off when she knew me better . "
6645	6690	6339	6340	his mother	330	" It is not timidity ; I never knew her otherwise than cold and reserved from her birth . I never could feel the same toward her as I did toward Edward , and therefore there must be something in Ellen to prevent it . "
6703	6741	6699	6699	she	433	" Are you quite sure , my dear Eleanor , that you have equally studied the characters of both your children ? because you know there are some cases which require more study and carefulness than others . "
6742	6759	6761	6762	Mrs. Fortescue	73	" I never was fond of studying any thing , Emmeline , as you may remember , "
6769	6974	6761	6762	Mrs. Fortescue	73	" and therefore I dare say I have not studied my children as you have yours . Besides , you know I always thought , and still think , the doctrine of mothers forming the characters of their children , and all that good people say about the importance of early impressions , perfectly ridiculous . The disposition for good or bad , loving or unloving , is theirs from the moment of their birth , and what human efforts can alter that ? Why , the very infancy of my children was different ; Edward was always laughing , and animated , and happy ; Ellen fretful and peevish , and so heavy that she never seemed even to know when I entered the room , while Edward would spring into my arms , and shout and laugh only to see me . Now what conduct on my part could have done this ? Surely I was justified in feeling differently toward such opposite dispositions ; and I know I never made more difference between them than — than papa did between us , Emmeline , and I have had greater reason to be partial ; you were always better than I was . "
7020	7027	7028	7028	she	434	" I must speak , Emmeline , "
7039	7117	7123	7123	she	436	" how did I repay my fond father 's partiality ? his too great indulgence ? Did I not bring down his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave ? Did I not throw shame and misery upon him by my conduct to the ill - fated one he had chosen for my husband ? Did I not?—oh , my God , my God ! Death may indeed be merciful!—my Edward might do the same by me ! "
8048	8065	8066	8066	she	73	" Come to me , Ellen , I have done you injustice , my sweet child , "
8088	8143	8066	8066	she	73	" I have not done my duty to you , I know — I feel I have not , and it is too late now to atone . I can only pray God to bless you , and raise you up a kinder parent than I have been ! Bless , bless you both . "
8189	8246	8176	8176	Ellen	113	" My own sister , bless you — for all you have been to me — all you will be to my children — may they repay you better than I have done , Emmeline ! You are right , there is but one hope , our Saviour , for the sinner — it is mine — "
8523	8539	8504	8504	she	330	" My Edward , did you not hear your mother pray God to bless you ? "
8547	8584	8540	8541	The child	346	" That good God has taken her to Himself , my love ; He has thought it better to remove her from us , and take her where she will never know pain nor illness more . "
8585	8592	8594	8594	Edward	76	" But she is lying there , "
8612	8627	8594	8594	Edward	76	" she is not taken away . Why will she not speak to me ? "
8628	8666	8540	8541	The child	346	" She can not speak , my sweet boy ! the soul which enabled her to speak , and smile , and live , was God 's gift , and it has pleased Him to recall it . "
8667	8696	8594	8594	Edward	76	" And will she never , never speak to me again ? will she never kiss me — never call me her own darling , beautiful Edward again ? "
8714	8762	8697	8697	he	76	" Mamma , mamma , my own dear , pretty , good mamma , oh ! do not go away from me — or let me go with you — let me die too ; no one will love me and kiss me as you have done . "
9414	9441	9443	9443	he	89	" Up so early , Ellen , why , I thought I should have been first , to show you I had not forgotten my promise . "
9459	9496	9452	9452	he	89	" Dear Arthur , how very kind you are ; but you look so sad — what is the matter ? Does not Mr. Myrvin like you to do this — pray do n't , then . "
9497	9548	9409	9410	Arthur Myrvin	89	" No , no , Ellen , my father said I was right , and that he would take care of the flowers also himself . I am only sorry you are going away , and to live so differently to what we do — you will quite forget me . "
9549	9627	9628	9628	Arthur	90	" Indeed , indeed I shall not , dear Arthur ; I can never forget those who have been so kind to me as you and dear Mr. Myrvin . I would much rather stay here always with you , than go among strangers again , but I heard my aunt say last night , that perhaps Mr. Myrvin would let you come and see us sometimes — and you will like that , will you not ? "
10043	10048	10068	10068	Emmeline	78	" Traits of Character , "
14702	14714	14716	14716	his	81	" She only wants to try the strength of my love , "
14720	14742	14716	14716	his	81	" and were she to torment health and life away , it will never change — she will be mine yet . "
15034	15049	15051	15053	his young mother	720	" Take care , Percy , love , do n't fall and frighten mamma , "
15138	15142	15143	15143	she	720	" Dearest Arthur , "
15147	15178	15143	15143	she	720	" I was actually foolish enough to send for you . Herbert seems quite well ; I was , it seems , needlessly alarmed , and Percy has this moment — "
15233	15250	15212	15212	she	720	" Will not Percy run to papa , and ask him why he looks so sad ? "
15312	15321	15329	15329	she	732	" Let me take Master Herbert , ma'am , "
17262	17271	17272	17272	she	91	" Is it already time to get up ? "
17283	17299	17300	17300	she	91	" I feel as if I had not slept at all . Am I dreaming ? "
17306	17325	17300	17300	she	91	" or have I slept in one place , and awoke in another ? Am I at Oakwood ? "
17326	17341	17382	17382	she	91	" No , dearest Eleanor ; will you not welcome me to Malvern House ? "
17977	18036	17974	17974	Eleanor	91	" Father , if it be sin to leave you , be it on your own head . I would have wedded with your consent , had you permitted it ; but now my destiny is fixed . There is no peace in England : at least let me be spared the agony of breaking another loving heart . "
18419	18429	18430	18430	she	91	" Do not touch that , Percy , love , "
18482	18501	18503	18503	she	91	" Come here , Percy , you have not played with these pretty things for a long time ; "
18552	18563	18541	18542	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" My Percy will not disobey mamma , will he ? "
18564	18569	18570	18570	he	815	" Me want that ; "
18608	18656	18604	18604	she	91	" But that is not a fit plaything for you , love ; besides , it is not mine , and we must not touch what is not ours . Come and see if we can not find something just as pretty , that you may have . "
18817	18842	18814	18814	Eleanor	91	" Emmeline ! I have been watching you for the last half hour , and I can not comprehend you . Do explain yourself . "
18843	18850	18852	18853	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" I will if I can ; "
18860	18874	18852	18853	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Why would you not let that poor little Percy have that toy ? "
18875	18898	18814	18814	Eleanor	91	" Because it would have been encouraging his touching or taking every thing he sees , whether proper for him or not . "
18899	18907	18814	18814	Eleanor	91	" But he could not understand that . "
18908	19008	18852	18853	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Not now , perhaps ; but I wish him to know that when I speak , he must obey me . It is , I think , a mistaken doctrine , that we ought to give children a reason for all we desire them to do . Obedience can then never be prompt , as it ought to be . And , in fact , if we wait until they are old enough to understand the reasons for a command , the task will be much more difficult , from the ascendency which willfulness may already have obtained . "
19009	19038	18814	18814	Eleanor	91	" But then why were you so cruel as to send the poor child up - stairs ? Was it not enough to take the toy from him ? "
19039	19055	18814	18814	Eleanor	91	" Not quite ; for him to remember that he must not touch it again . "
19056	19066	18852	18853	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" And do you really think he will not ? "
19067	19115	18814	18814	Eleanor	91	" I can only hope so , Eleanor ; but I must not be disheartened if he do . He is an infant still , and I can not expect him to learn such a difficult lesson as obedience in one , two , or six lessons . "
19116	19133	18814	18814	Eleanor	91	" And will he love you as much as if you had given it to him ? "
19134	19173	18852	18853	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Not at the moment , perhaps , but when he is older he will love me more . And it is that hope which reconciles me to the pain which refusing to indulge him costs me now . "
19174	19198	19200	19200	Eleanor	91	" And voluntarily you will bear the pain which had almost brought tears into the eyes of the severe and stoical Mrs. Hamilton ! "
19202	19245	19200	19200	Eleanor	91	" It was a foolish weakness , my dear Eleanor , for which my husband would have chidden me ; but there must be pain to a mother if called upon to exert authority , when inclination so strongly points to indulgence . "
19246	19290	18852	18853	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Well , if ever I have any thing to do with children , I certainly shall not be half as particular as you are , Emmeline . I really can not imagine what harm gratifying myself and Percy could possibly have done . "
19291	19332	19333	19334	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" If ever you have children , my dear Eleanor , may you have strength of mind and self - control sufficient to forget self , and refuse the gratification of the present moment for the welfare of future years ! "
19495	19506	19475	19475	his	99	" Me no touch that — Percy good boy now , "
19658	19673	19653	19653	she	91	" Will not Percy give Lina some of those kisses as well as mamma ? "
19917	24880	24889	24889	she	80	" From the moment Arthur Hamilton returned to Cheltenham with the painful intelligence that he had arrived at Leith only in time to witness the departure of the beautiful vessel which contained Captain Fortescue and the exquisitely lovely bride who had , it seemed , turned the heads of all the usually quiet Scotsmen who had seen her , Lord Delmont gradually sunk . The agony of losing her forever — for so he regarded her departure for , and residence in India for an indeterminate time — conquered every other feeling . Her conduct had caused emotions of anguish far too deep for the relieving sensation of anger . The name of the lady from whose house and by whose connivance she had eloped , he was never heard to breathe ; but , if ever casually mentioned before him , every feature would become convulsed , and he would instantly leave the room . Often and often he accused his own harshness as the cause of driving her from him , and then came , with overwhelming bitterness , the thought that if he lately had been harsh , surely the recollection of all the indulgent fondness he had shown demanded some gratitude in return . If she had but written , had but expressed one wish for his continued love , one regret for his present pain ! But no letter came , and the contending but all - depressing emotions so completely undermined a constitution never very strong , and already worn by care , that when another and still heavier trial came , he sunk at once beneath it . Though Eleanor had been his favorite , his feelings of pride and hope had greatly centered in his son , whose career , in five years ' active service on board a man - of - war , had been such as to raise him already to a lieutenancy , and excite every gratifying emotion , not only in his immediate family , but in a large circle of admiring friends . Mrs. Hamilton 's love for her brother had naturally increased , strong as it always had been , even in childhood — and the visits which Charles had been enabled to make to Oakwood , brief in duration as they were compelled to be , had always been fraught with heartfelt , joyous happiness , not only to herself but to her husband . The pain and anxiety attendant on Eleanor 's elopement , and the dread of its effects on Lord Delmont , had for two or three months been the sole subject of thought ; but at length , and , like a fearful flash bringing a new sorrow to light , it pressed upon them that it was long after the period that intelligence of Charles ought to have been received . Still hoping against hope , not only the Delmont family , but all who had friends and relatives on board the Leander , imagined that she might have drifted from her course , or been engaged on some secret and distant expedition , but that intelligence concerning her would and must soon come . Alas ! after months of agonizing suspense , information was received that several planks and masts , bearing evidence of fire as well as water , and some sea - chests , bearing names , only too soon recognized as those of some of the Leander 's crew , had been cast off the coast of Barbary , and there could be no more doubt that death or slavery — that fearful slavery which the bombardment of Algiers had so displayed to European eyes — was the portion of all those beloved ones , for whom so many aching hearts and eyes had watched and wept in vain . It was a trial so terrible that Mrs. Hamilton felt at first as if even submission had departed from her ; and she could almost have rebelled in spirit against the inscrutable decree , that had consigned one so free from vice and evil , so full of happiness and worth , to a doom so terrible . Much as she had loved and reverenced her husband before , she seemed never to have felt his worth and tenderness till then . It was his sympathy , his strength , that recalled her to a sense of her duty , and gave her power to endure , by a realization once more of that submissiveness to a Father 's will , which had never before failed her . But time , though it softened the first anguish , had no power over the memories of this brother , not even when the increasing cares and joys of maternity so fully engrossed her , that the present and the future of her children appeared to have banished all of her own past . Lord Delmont did not survive the mournful tidings of the certain wreck of the Leander above two months ; but his released spirit did not meet that of his son . Charles was not dead . He toiled as a slave long years in living death , before there was even a partial amelioration of his sufferings . But no tidings of him ever came , a young child of three years old , a distant branch of the Manvers family , became Lord Delmont . Years rolled on , and Mrs. Hamilton 's lot was so full of tranquil happiness , so fraught with the innumerable daily joys of a loving wife and devoted mother , that her prayer was ever rising for guidance , and gratitude , that prosperity might not unfit her for the dark days of trial and adversity , when they should come . That she had cares as well as joys could not be otherwise , when so intensely anxious to bring up her children with more regard to their spiritual and moral welfare , than even the cultivation of their intellect . She was one of those who thought still more of the training of the heart than of the mind , believing that were the first properly awakened , the latter would need little incitement to exertion . Two girls had been the sole addition to her family . One other wish , and one of many years ' standing , Mrs. Hamilton had it in her power to fulfill . From childhood she had been accustomed to think of Lucy Harcourt as one , to whom it might one day be in her power to return the heavy debt of gratitude she owed her mother ; she had been accustomed to correspond with her from very early years ; Mrs. Harcourt delighting in creating a mutual interest between her pupil and the child from whom circumstances had so sadly separated her . When therefore an event of a very painful nature to Miss Harcourt 's individual feelings compelled her — as the only hope of regaining peace , and strengthening her for the arduous duty of instruction , which she knew , as a single woman , was her sole source of independent subsistence — she had no scruple in accepting that friendship which Mrs. Hamilton had so warmly proffered . A very few days of personal intercourse sufficed for mutual conviction , that correspondence had not deceived in the favorable impressions of either . Miss Harcourt found , indeed , the friend her aching spirit needed ; and Mrs. Hamilton , long before the months of repose which she had insisted should forestall the commencement of exertion were over , rejoiced in the conviction that the daughter of her beloved and regretted friend was indeed well - fitted for that position in her family — her helper in the moral and intellectual training of her daughters — which her vivid fancy had often pictured as so filled . They were indeed but infants when Miss Harcourt arrived ; but Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton found means to overrule the honorable scruples which , on the part of Lucy , seemed at first against their plan , and in her gradually returning health and peace , Mrs. Hamilton not only rejoiced , but felt gratefully thankful that the wish of so many years ' standing , and which had seemed so little likely to be fulfilled , was absolutely accomplished , and she could prove how deeply she had loved and mourned her truly maternal friend . It is astonishing how often , if an earnest , heartfelt desire for the gratification of some good feeling or for the performance of some good deed be steadily and unvaryingly held before us , without any regard to its apparent impossibility , its accomplishment is at length obtained . It is supposed to be only done so in books , but this is a mistaken supposition , arising from the simple fact of individuals so often forgetting their own past , and failing steadily to pursue one object , regardless of the lapse of years . If they looked into themselves more often and more carefully , if they sought consistency in desire and pursuit , they would often be startled at their connection , and that it is not so useless to wish and seek , when both are of such a nature as can be based on and strengthened by prayer , as it may seem . Human life presents as many startling connections and contingencies as romance — only , as the actors not the observers of this world 's busy scene , we can not trace them as we do in books . The thought of Eleanor was the only dark shade in Mrs. Hamilton 's life . She had written to her often , but communication with India was not then what it is now , and her letters might not have reached their destination ; especially as being in active service , Captain Fortescue was himself constantly changing his quarters . Whatever the cause ( for Eleanor 's letters , Mrs. Hamilton thought , might also have miscarried ) , she heard nothing of her till the hurried epistle commenced by her sister , and finished by Mr. Myrvin , brought the startling intelligence that she was a widow and dying , unable to reach Oakwood , where she had hoped at least to have sufficient strength to bring her children , and implore for them protection and love and conjuring Mrs. Hamilton to come to her without delay . The letter , imperfectly directed , had been days on its journey , and it was with the most melancholy forebodings Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton had started for Llangwillan . But though it was not till many years after Edward and Ellen Fortescue became inmates of her family that Mrs. Hamilton became acquainted with all the particulars of their childhood , it is necessary that our readers should be rather more enlightened ; otherwise the character of Ellen may be to them as unnatural and as incomprehensible as it was to her aunt . That Eleanor could realize true happiness in a marriage entered into only because she could not bear the torture of her own thoughts , and her constant dread of the world 's contumely , was not likely . At first , indeed , it was a very delightful thing to find herself the object not only of devotion to her husband ( whom , could she entirely have forgotten Fitzclair , she might have really loved ) , but a still more brilliant star in India than she had even been in England . Though Captain Fortescue was often engaged in marches and countermarches , where Eleanor sometimes , though very rarely , accompanied him , still there were intervals of rest for him in the larger cities , where his wife ever shone pre - eminent . For the first three or four years , the pride he felt in seeing her so universally admired , in the greater attention he received for her sake , compensated for , or concealed the qualities , which , as a soldier 's wife , he had fondly believed she would possess . But as his health , always delicate , became more and more undermined , and compelled him to relinquish society , at least in a great measure , and to look for the quiet pleasures of domestic life , he found , and bitter was that first awakening , that his wishes , his comfort , were of no importance . She could not resign the pleasures of society — of still being enabled to pursue the dangerous amusement of her girlhood ( though so guardedly that not a rumor against her ever found breath ) , for the dullness of her home . Yet still he loved her ; and when Eleanor , with all the fascinating playfulness of her former self , would caress and try to persuade him to go out with her , and not sit moping at home , and that if he would , she would behave just as he liked , and if he did not care to see her surrounded , as she knew she was , by red coats , she would dismiss them all , and devote herself to him — but indeed she could not stay at home — he would feel that it would be cruel indeed to chain such a being to his side , and sometimes make the exertion ( for which he was little fitted ) to accompany her ; at others , with kind words and indulgent love , permit her to follow her own wishes , and remain alone . But little did he think the real reason that Eleanor could not rest in quiet at home . The recollection of Lord Fitzclair was at such times so fearfully vivid , that the very agony she had endured when first told of his fearful end would return in all its intensity ; the thought : Had her father really cursed her for her disobedience , and was it that forever hovering round her , preventing any thing like lasting happiness . And yet , by a strange contradiction , while the idea of her father 's curse shook her whole frame at times with convulsive sobs , pride , that most fatal ingredient of her character , utterly prevented all attempt on her part to communicate with her relations . She said , as they had made no effort to conciliate , she would not ; and yet the longing for Emmeline sometimes became actually painful . Eleanor was never intended for the heartless , reckless being she had tried to become . It was a constant and most terrible struggle between the good and evil parts of her nature , and though the evil triumphed — in the determination that nothing should change her course of action , nothing compel her to acknowledge she had ever been in the wrong , and was really not the perfect creature which flattery was ever ready to pour into her ear — the good had yet so much power as to make her miserable , by the conviction , that she was not what she might have been — that she never could be happy — that every pleasure was hollow , every amusement vain . Again and again the memories of Emmeline 's gentle , sustaining , ever active piety would come before her , as if beseeching her to seek the only fount of peace ; but so terrible was the self - reproach , the anguish which the thought called up , that she always turned from it with a shudder , resolved that religion was never meant for such as herself , and that its restrictions should never enter her mind , or its dictates pass her lips . With the awakening intelligence of her son , however , there seemed one pleasure not wholly hollow — one enjoyment without the shadow of alloy ; and she grasped it with an avidity and a constancy , that in a character generally so wavering and inconsistent was almost incredible . That her son was from his earliest infancy the image of herself , might have added strength to the feeling ; but the intense love , almost idolatry , she felt toward him , increasing with his growth , did much toward banishing the unpleasant feelings of remorse and home - sickness . She devoted herself to her boy , not judiciously indeed , for she was not one to practice self - denial in education ; and as Edward 's disposition was not one to cause her annoyance , even from over - indulgence , there was not even the check of his ill - temper or rudeness toward herself , to whisper the fearful evil she was engendering . What was the emotion which had so riveted her to her son , it might have been difficult to ascertain ; it could scarcely have been the mere instinct of maternity , for then it would have extended to her daughter ; but as complete as was her indulgence to Edward , so was her neglect of Ellen . Colonel Fortescue ( for he had gradually attained that rank ) had borne , without complaint , neglect of himself ; nay , it had not had power in the least degree to diminish his love , though it might have awakened him to the consciousness that his wife was indeed not perfect . Her devotion to Edward , even undertaking the toilsome task of instruction , had delighted him ; for , at first , having been much from home , he was not conscious of the lonely fate of his little girl ; but when the truth became evident , that she was an object almost of dislike — that she was left entirely to the tender mercies of a hireling , and Eleanor only alluded to her , to contrast her peevishness and stupidity with Edward 's happiness and intellect , all the father was roused within him , and , for the first time , he felt and expressed serious displeasure . He acknowledged that his son might , indeed , be superior in beauty and talent , but he would not allow that Ellen 's affections were less warm , or her temper less capable of guidance . To him , and to all who had in the least attended to childhood , Ellen 's face , even from infancy , expressed not ill - temper , but suffering . Continually ill , for she inherited her father 's constitution , the poor little infant was constantly crying or fretful ; which Eleanor ; never having known what illness was , attributed at once to a naturally evil temper which annoyed her . The nurse , as ignorant as she was obsequious , adopted the same opinion ; and , before she was even three years old , harshness , both by nurse and mother , had been constantly used , to make Ellen as good a child as her brother . In vain did the colonel , when he became aware of this treatment , remonstrate that it was the illness of the poor child — neither obstinacy nor ill - temper : his wife would not understand him , and at length he sternly and peremptorily declared , that as she had her will with Edward , he would have his with Ellen , and that no chastisement should be inflicted . If she did wrong , he was to be told of it , and if necessary he would reprove her , but he would allow no other interference . Mrs. Fortescue made not the least objection , believing that as her husband had thus taken her in charge , she was exonerated from all blame if she left her entirely to him . Only too quickly did the poor child discover that the lovely being whom she called mother , and whom she loved so fondly , had no love , no caress for her . Repeated punishment , though it had only extended to her fifth year , had completely crushed the gentle , tender spirit , that had required such judicious nursing ; and combined with physical suffering , instead of deadening the feelings , as in some dispositions it would have done , had rendered them morbidly acute — an effect which constant loneliness naturally deepened . Her father 's love and caresses had caused her to cling to him so passionately , that every word he said , every request he made her , was treasured and thought upon , when he was away from her , with a tenacity many would have fancied unnatural in a child . He taught her , though his heart often bled as he did so ( for what claim had her mother upon the feelings he sought to inculcate ) , to love , honor , and obey her mother in all things ; that if she did so , she would be as happy as Edward in time , and Ellen , though she did not understand him , obeyed ; but Colonel Fortescue little imagined the evil which was accruing from these very natural lessons . Ellen learned to believe that , as her mother never noticed her , except in accounts of anger or irritation , it must be her own fault . She longed to be beautiful and buoyant as Edward ; and that she was neither , marked her in her own young mind as so inferior , it was no wonder her mother could not caress or love her . Had Edward presumed on his favoritism , and been unkind or neglectful , she might , perhaps , have envied more than she loved him ; but his disposition was naturally so noble , so open - hearted , so generous , that he always treated her with affection , and would share with her his playthings and sweets , even while he could not but believe her in all things his inferior ; and that as such , of course , her wishes could never cross with his . Poor child , she scarcely knew what it was to wish , except that she might cling to her mother as she did to her father , and that she could but be good and beautiful enough to win her love ! The lesson of concealment of every feeling is but too easily and too early learned . Tears do not flow even from childhood , when always rudely checked , and angrily reproved . Affection can not display itself unless called forth ; and so the very outward seeming of children is more in a parent 's hand than mere superficial observers may believe : and Mrs. Fortescue blamed and disliked the cold inanimate exterior which she had never tried to warm . Ellen 's extreme difficulty in acquiring knowledge , compared with Edward 's extraordinary quickness , only confirmed her painful conviction of her great inferiority , the impossibility of her ever winning love — and the consequent increased intensity of her affection for her father and brother , who loved her notwithstanding . That the child herself could not have defined these sensations is true , but that they had existence , even before she was nine years old , and that they influenced many years of her after - life , causing error and suffering , and rendering Mrs. Hamilton 's task one of pain and difficulty , before these mistaken influences could be eradicated , is equally so . The power over early years is so immense , its responsibility so extensive , its neglect or abuse may indeed make the earnest thinker tremble ; less , perhaps , for the actual amount of general evil , for that circumstances in after life are sometimes graciously permitted to avert , but for individual suffering and individual joy — and especially is this the case in the training of girls . More enduring in their very fragility than boys , they may be compared to those precious metals which fire and water and pressure have no power to break , but simply to draw out to a thinner and thinner thread , dwindling more and more , but to its last spider - woven fineness capable of tenuity and vitality . While boys , like men , are often crushed at once — the frame of the one and the spirit of the other equally unable to endure . The displeasure of her husband , his reproaches for her conduct to Ellen , by causing some degree of annoyance , increased Mrs. Fortescue 's feelings of dislike toward the object who had caused it , and this was soon afterward heightened by self - reproach . A malignant fever broke out in the British settlement where Colonel Fortescue was stationed ; his wife and children were with him , and , dreadfully alarmed , Eleanor determined to remove with her children to some less unhealthy spot . The colonel willingly consented ; but before their hasty preparations were concluded Ellen sickened . Alarm for Edward , however , so engrossed the mother , that she appeared incapable of any other thought . In vain Colonel Fortescue urged that his son would be safe with the friends who had promised to take charge of him , and who were on the point of leaving the city ; that there were none on whom he could depend so to tend the little sufferer as not to require a guiding head , and she knew how impossible it was for him to be with his child as his heart prompted . He urged , entreated , commanded in vain , Mrs. Fortescue was inexorable . She declared that the idea of her son being away from her at such a time would drive her mad ; and as for duty , one child demanded her care as much as another ; that her husband might not care about thus exposing her to infection , but she really thought , for Edward 's sake , it was her duty to take care of herself . It might be nothing to the colonel or Ellen whether she lived or died , but to Edward it was a great deal ; and so as she must choose between them , she would go with him who loved her best , and who would be miserable without her . The haughty , angry tone with which she spoke , the unjust taunt , roused every indignant feeling , and Colonel Fortescue said more in that moment of irritation than he could have believed possible . But it only awakened the cold , sustaining pride which Eleanor always called to her aid when conscience smote her , and she departed with her son , hardening every better feeling , and rousing anger against her husband and child to conquer the suffering of self - reproach . But when many miles from the city of death , and there were no fears for Edward , anxiety and wretchedness so assailed her , that pride itself gave way . To communicate with the infected city was difficult , and very infrequent , and again and again did she wish that she had remained . During the continuance of Ellen 's illness her father 's anguish was indeed terrible . Every leisure moment he spent by her side , moistening her parched lips , bathing her burning forehead , and listening to the plaintive accents of delirium with an acuteness of suffering , that injured his own health more than he had the least idea of . The attendants were really both kind and skillful , but the colonel fancied , when he was not with her , she was neglected , and in still greater suffering ; and the struggle between his duties and his child was almost more than he could bear . He had never been a religious man — never known what it was to pray , except in the public services of his regiment , but now prayer , earnest , heartfelt , poured from him , and the thankfulness to God , which so overpowered him , when she was pronounced out of danger , as to compel him to weep like a child , planted a sense of a Father 's infinite love and infinite compassion within him , which was his sole sustainer the short remainder of his life . Eleanor 's letters , few as they were , had in some degree softened his anger toward her ; but as he beheld the ravages of disease on his poor child 's face and form , rendering her still less attractive than she had been , and perceived that bodily weakness had extended to her mind , and often and often forced tears from her eyes and momentary complainings , he trembled lest Eleanor should find still more to dislike and reprove ; and often his heart bled as Ellen would ask with tears , for her dear mamma , adding , plaintively , "
24938	25707	24929	24929	me?—and	842	" And what could the colonel reply , except that her mother feared Edward would take the infection , and therefore she was obliged to go with him to some place of safety ? And his child was satisfied , repeating so fondly her delight that her dear , dear Edward had been saved from being as ill as she was , that her father clasped her closer and closer to his heart , feeling the intrinsic beauty of a disposition that , instead of repining that she was left alone to suffer , could rejoice that her brother had been spared . Colonel Fortescue obtained a few weeks ' leave , that he might take his child to the sea - side as recommended , ere she joined her mother . And alone with him , gradually regaining a moderate degree of strength , Ellen was very happy ; but such bright intervals were indeed few and far between . There was no change in her mother 's conduct toward her , when reunited . Her heart had , indeed , risen to her lips as she again beheld the child so nearly lost ; and had she followed impulse , she would have clasped her in her arms and wept over her , but that would have seemed tacitly to acknowledge that she had been wrong , and had suffered from it ; and so she refrained , causing suffering to herself , anguish to her child , and pain to her husband , all from that fell demon , pride . She only chose to remember that it was Ellen who had been the cause of her husband 's anger — Ellen , the constant subject of contention between them — Ellen , always causing the pang of self - reproach : and so how was it possible that she could love her ? About a year after Ellen 's dangerous illness , when she was nearly ten , and Edward just eleven , Colonel Fortescue was ordered to take command of some troops to be stationed at a fort , whose vicinity to some hostile natives rendered it rather a post of danger . The wives and children of the officers were permitted to accompany them , if they wished it , and , except in the colonel 's own family , there had been no hesitation in their choice . The colonel was strangely and painfully depressed as with some vague dread , and all his affection for his wife had returned with such force as to make him shrink in unusual suffering from the idea of leaving her ; and conquering reluctance , for he felt as if she would not accede , he implored her to accompany him , confessing he felt ill and unhappy , and shrank from a separation . His wife looked at him with astonishment ; he had never asked nor thought of such a thing before , she said , in their many brief partings , and she really could not understand him . The place was decidedly unhealthy , and Edward must not be exposed to its malaria ; besides which , she had promised him to go to a juvenile ball , which was given by an English family of rank , in a fortnight 's time , and she could not possibly disappoint him ; and why her husband should wish for her in such a place she could not imagine , but she knew she should die of terror before she had been there a week . Not a word did the colonel utter in reply , but he felt as if an ice - bolt had struck his heart and frozen it at once . He fixed his eyes upon her , with a strange , sad , reproaching look , which haunted her till her death , and turning from her , sought the room where Ellen was preparing her lessons for the joyful hour when he could attend to her . As she sprung toward him with a cry of glee , he clasped her to his bosom , without the power of uttering a sound , save a groan so deep and hollow , that the child 's unusual glee was checked , and she clung to him in terror ; and when he could tell her that he was about to leave her , and for an indefinite time , her passionate grief seemed almost to comfort him , by its strong evidence of her childish love . "
25756	26630	25749	25749	you	843	" And she looked in his face so beseechingly , that the colonel had no strength to resist , and fondly kissing her , he promised that if Mrs. Cameron would permit her to join her little family , she should go with him : and , to Ellen 's intense thankfulness , the permission was willingly accorded . Mrs. Fortescue had indeed replied , when her husband briefly imparted his intention , that he certainly must intend Ellen to be ill again , by exposing her to such an unhealthy climate ; and that if she were , he must not be angry if she refused to go and nurse her , as it would be all his weak indulgence , and no fault of hers . The colonel made no answer , and irritated beyond measure at his manner , Eleanor parted from her husband in coldness and in pride . The fortnight passed , and Mrs. Fortescue felt as if her own youth were indeed renewed , the longings for universal admiration again her own ; but now it was only for her son , and her triumph was complete ; many and lovely were the youthful beings called together on that festive night , seeming as if England had concentrated her fairest and purest offspring in that far distant land ; but Edward , and his still lovely mother , outshone them all . That she was herself admired as much , if not more , than she had ever been in her palmy days of triumph , Eleanor scarcely knew ; her every feeling was centered in her boy , and consequently the supercilious haughtiness which had so often marred her beauty in former days was entirely laid aside , and maternal pride and pleasure gratified to the utmost , added a new charm to her every movement and every word . She heard the universal burst of admiration which greeted her , as to oblige Edward she went through a quadrille with him , and never in her whole career had she felt so triumphant , so proud , so joyous . During the past fortnight she had often been tormented by self - reproach , and her husband 's look had disagreeably haunted her ; but this night not a fleeting thought of either the colonel or Ellen entered her mind , and her pleasure was complete . Tired with dancing , and rather oppressed with the heat , Eleanor quitted the crowded ball - room , and stood for a few minutes quite alone in a solitary part of the verandah , which , covered with lovely flowers , ran round the house . The music in the ball - room sounded in the distance as if borne by the night breeze in softened harmony over the distant hills . The moon was at the full , and lit up nearly the whole garden with the refulgence of a milder day . At that moment a cold chill crept over the heart and frame of Eleanor , causing her breath to come thick and gaspingly . Why , she knew not , for there was nothing visible to cause it , save that , in one part of the garden , a cluster of dark shrubs , only partly illuminated by the rays of the moon , seemed suddenly to have assumed the shape of a funeral bier , covered with a military pall . At the same moment the music in the ball - room seemed changed to the low wailing plaint and muffled drums , the military homage to some mighty dead . And if it were indeed but excited fancy , it had a strange effect , for Eleanor fainted on the marble floor . That same afternoon Colonel Fortescue , with some picked men , had set off to discover the track of some marauding natives , who for some days had been observed hovering about the neighborhood . Military ardor carried him farther than he intended , and it was nearly night , when entering a narrow defile , a large body of the enemy burst upon them , and a desperate contest ensued . The defile was so hemmed in with rock and mountain , that though not very distant from the fort , the noise of the engagement had not been distinguished . Captain Cameron was quietly sitting with his wife and elder children , awaiting without any forebodings the return of the colonel . Though it was late , Ellen 's fears had been so visible , that Mrs. Cameron could not send her to bed ; the child seemed so restless and uneasy that the captain had tried to laugh her out of her cowardice , as he called it , declaring that her father would disown her if she could not be more brave . Hasty footsteps were at length heard approaching , and Ellen started from her seat and sprung forward , as the door opened ; but it was not the colonel , only a sergeant , who had accompanied him , and whose face caused Captain Cameron to exclaim , in alarm , "
26646	26647	25749	25749	you	843	" "
26657	26663	25749	25749	you	843	" was the energetic reply . "
26696	26727	26729	26729	you	851	" The captain started from his chair , but before he could frame another word , Ellen had caught hold of the old man 's arm , and wildly exclaimed , "
26762	26829	26836	26836	Ellen	113	" The man could not answer her — for her look and tone , he afterward declared to his comrades , went through his heart , just for all the world like a saber cut ; and for the moment neither Captain nor Mrs. Cameron could address her . The shock seemed to have banished voice from all , save from the poor child principally concerned . "
26838	26860	26836	26836	Ellen	113	" Mrs. Cameron at length said , advancing to her , as she stood still clinging to the sergeant 's arm : "
26888	26889	26886	26886	me	0	" "
26896	26902	26886	26886	me	0	" was the agonized reply ; "
26953	27200	26943	26944	Mrs. Cameron	115	" And they who knew all which that father was to his poor Ellen , could not resist that appeal . The sergeant said the colonel was not dead , but so mortally wounded they feared to move him . It was a fearful scene . Death in its most horrid form was all around her ; her little feet were literally deluged in blood , and she frequently stumbled over the dusky forms and mangled and severed limbs that lay on the grass , but neither sob nor cry escaped her till she beheld her father . His men had removed him from the immediate scene of slaughter , and tried to form a rough pallet of military cloaks , but the ghastly countenance , which the moon 's light rendered still more fixed and pallid , the rigidity of his limbs , all seemed to denote they had indeed arrived too late , and that terrible stillness was broken by the convulsed and passionate sobs of the poor child , who , flinging herself beside him , besought him only to open his eyes , to look upon her once more , to call her his darling , and kiss her once , only once again : and it seemed as if her voice had indeed power to recall the fluttering soul . The heavy eyes did unclose , the clenched hand relaxed to try and clasp his child , and he murmured feebly — "
27219	27238	27215	27215	Cameron	115	" The captain knelt down by him and convulsively pressed his hand , but he could not speak . "
27284	27303	27282	27282	Ellen	113	" A fearful convulsion choked his voice , but after a little while he tried to speak again — "
27380	28989	27342	27342	she	3462	" He tried to press his lips again on Ellen 's cheek and brow , but the effort was vain — and at the very moment Mrs. Fortescue had stood transfixed by some unknown terror , her husband ceased to breathe . It was long before Ellen rallied from that terrible scene . Even when the fever which followed subsided , and she had been taken , apparently perfectly restored to health , once more to her mother and brother , its recollection so haunted her , that her many lonely hours became fraught with intense suffering . Her imagination , already only too morbid , dwelt again and again upon the minutest particular of that field of horror ; not only her father , but the objects which , when her whole heart was wrapped in him , she seemed not even to have seen . The ghastly heaps of dead , the severed limbs , the mangled trunks , the gleaming faces all fixed in the distorted expressions with which they died — the very hollow groans and louder cry of pain which , as she passed through the field , had fallen on her ear unheeded , returned to the poor child 's too early awakened fancy so vividly , that often and often it was only a powerful though almost unconscious effort that prevented the scream of fear . Her father 's last words were never forgotten ; she would not only continue to love her mother because he had desired her to do so , but because he had so loved her , and on her first return home this seemed easier than ever to accomplish . Mrs. Fortescue , tortured by remorse and grief , had somewhat softened toward the child who had received the last breath of her husband ; and could Ellen have overcome the reserve and fear which so many years of estrangement had engendered , and given vent to the warmth of her nature , Mrs. Fortescue might have learned to know , and knowing , to love her — but it was then too late . So torturing were Mrs. Fortescue 's feelings when she recalled the last request of her husband , and her cruel and haughty refusal ; when that which had seemed so important , a juvenile ball — because not to go would disappoint Edward — became associated with his fearful death , and sunk into worse than nothing — she had parted with him in anger , and it proved forever;—that even as England had become odious to her , twelve years before , so did India now ; and she suddenly resolved to quit it , and return to the relatives she had neglected so long , but toward whom she now yearned more than ever . She thought and believed such a complete change would and must bring peace . Alas ! what change will remove the torture of remorse ? Though incapable of real love , from her studied heartlessness , it was impossible for her to have lived twelve years with one so indulgent and fond as Colonel Fortescue , without realizing some degree of affection , and his unexpected and awful death roused every previously dormant feeling so powerfully , that she was astonished at herself , and in her misery believed that the feeling had only come , to add to her burden — for what was the use of loving now ? and determined to rouse herself , she made every preparation for immediate departure , but she was painfully arrested . The selfish mother had fled from the couch of her suffering child , and now a variation of the same complaint laid her on a bed of pain . It was a desperate struggle between life and death ; but she rallied , and insisted on taking her passage for England some weeks before her medical attendant thought it advisable . The constant struggle between the whisperings of good and the dominion of evil , which her whole life had been , had unconsciously undermined a constitution naturally good ; and when to this was added a malignant disease , though brief in itself , the seeds of a mortal complaint were planted , which , ere the long voyage was concluded , had obtained fatal and irremediable ascendency , and occasioned those sufferings and death which in our first chapters we described . To Edward , though the death of his father had caused him much childish grief , still more perhaps from sympathy with the deep suffering of his mother , than a perfect consciousness of his own heavy loss , the manner in which he died was to him a source of actual pride . He had always loved the histories of heroes , military and naval , and gloried in the idea that his father had been one of them , and died as they did , bravely fighting against superior numbers , and in the moment of a glorious victory . He had never seen death , and imagined not all the attendant horrors of such a one ; and how that Ellen could never even hear the word without shuddering he could not understand , nor why she should always so painfully shrink from the remotest reference to that night , which was only associated in his mind with emotions of pleasure . In the tedious voyage of nearly six months ( for five - and - twenty years ago the voyage from India to England was not what it is now ) , the character of Edward shone forth in such noble coloring as almost to excuse his mother 's idolatry , and win for him the regard of passengers and crew . Captain Cameron had impressed on his mind that he now stood in his father 's place to his mother and sister ; and as the idea of protecting is always a strong incentive to manliness in a boy , however youthful , Edward well redeemed the charge , so devoting himself not only to his mother , but to Ellen , that her affection for him redoubled , as did her mistaken idea of his vast superiority . His taste had always pointed to the naval in preference to the military profession , and the voyage confirmed it . Before he had been a month on board he had become practically an expert sailor — had learned all the technical names of the various parts of a ship , and evinced the most eager desire for the acquirement of navigation . Nor did he fail in the true sailor spirit , when , almost within sight of England , a tremendous storm arose , reducing the vessel almost to a wreck , carrying her far from her destined moorings , and compelling her , after ten days ' doubt whether or not she would reach land in safety , to anchor in Milford Haven , there to repair her injuries , ere she could be again seaworthy . The passengers here left her , and Mrs. Fortescue , whose illness the terrors of the storm had most alarmingly increased , was conveyed to Pembroke in an almost exhausted state ; but once on land she rallied , resolved on instantly proceeding to Swansea , then cross to Devonshire , and travel direct to Oakwood , where she had no doubt her sister was . But her temper was destined to be tried still more . The servant who had accompanied her from India , an Englishwoman , tired out with the fretful impatience of Mrs. Fortescue during the voyage , and disappointed that she did not at once proceed to London , demanded her instant discharge , as she could not stay any longer from her friends . The visible illness of her mistress might have spared this unfeeling act , but Eleanor had never shown feeling or kindness to her inferiors , and therefore , perhaps , had no right to expect them . Her suppressed anger and annoyance so increased physical suffering , that had it not been for her children she must have sunk at once ; but for their sakes she struggled with that deadly exhaustion , and set off the very next morning , without any attendant , for Swansea . They were not above thirty miles from this town when , despite her every effort , Mrs. Fortescue became too ill to proceed . There was no appearance of a town or village , but the owners of a half - way house , pitying the desolate condition of the travelers , directed the postboy to the village of Llangwillan ; which , though out of the direct road and four or five miles distant , was yet the nearest place of shelter . And never in her whole life had Mrs. Fortescue experienced such a blessed sensation of physical relief , as when the benevolent exertions of Mr. Myrvin had installed her in widow Morgan 's humble dwelling , and by means of soothing medicine and deep repose in some degree relieved the torture of a burning brain and aching frame . Still she hoped to rally , and obtain strength sufficient to proceed ; and bitter was the anguish when the hope was compelled to be relinquished.—With all that followed , our readers are already acquainted , and we will , therefore , at once seek the acquaintance of Mrs. Hamilton 's own family , whose "
28993	30457	30458	30458	I	0	" will , we hope , illustrate other and happier home influences than those of indiscreet indulgence and culpable neglect . The curtains were drawn close , the large lamp was on the table , and a cheerful fire blazing in the grate ; for though only September , the room was sufficiently large , and the evenings sufficiently chill , for a fire to add greatly to its aspect of true English comfort . There were many admirable pictures suspended on the walls , and well - filled book - cases , desks , and maps , stands of beautiful flowers , and some ingenious toys , all seeming to proclaim the apartment as the especial possession of the young party who were this evening busily engaged at the large round table which occupied the centre of the room . They were only four in number , but what with a large desk piled with books and some most alarming - sized dictionaries , which occupied the elder of the two lads , the embroidery frame of the elder girl , the dissected map before her sister , and two or three books scattered round the younger boy , the table seemed so well filled that Miss Harcourt had quietly ensconced herself in her own private little corner , sufficiently near to take an interest , and sometimes join in the conversation of her youthful charge ; but so apart as to be no restraint upon them , and to enable her to pursue her own occupations of either reading , writing , or working uninterruptedly . Could poor Mrs. Fortescue have glanced on the happy group , she certainly might have told her sister , with some show of justice , that there was such an equal distribution of interesting and animated expression ( which is the great beauty of youth ) , that she could not have known the trial of having such a heavy , dull , unhappy child as Ellen . Mrs. Hamilton , indeed , we rather think , would not have considered such a trial , except as it proved ill - health and physical pain in the little sufferer ; and , perhaps her increased care and tenderness ( for such with her would have been the consequence of the same cause which had created her sister 's neglect ) might have removed both the depression of constant but impalpable illness , and the expression of heaviness and gloom . Certain it is , that her own Herbert had , with regard to delicate health , given her more real and constant anxiety than Eleanor had ever allowed herself to experience with Ellen ; but there was nothing in the boy 's peculiarly interesting countenance to denote the physical suffering he very often endured . Care and love had so surrounded his path with blessings , that he was often heard to declare , that he never even wished to be as strong as his brother , or to share his active pleasures , he had so many others equally delightful . Whether it was his physical temperament , inducing a habitude of reflection and studious thought much beyond his years , or whether the unusually gifted mind worked on the frame , or the one combined to form the other , it would be as impossible to decide with regard to him as with hundreds of others like him ; but he certainly seemed , not only to his parents , but to their whole household , and to every one who casually associated with him , to have more in him of heaven than earth ; as if indeed he were only lent , not given . And often , and often his mother 's heart ached with its very intensity of love , causing the unspoken dread — how might she hope to retain one so faultless , and yet so full of every human sympathy and love ! The delicate complexion , beautiful color of his cheeks and lips , and large soft , very dark blue eye , with its long black lash , high , arched brow , shaded by glossy chestnut hair , were all so lit up with the rays of mind , that though his face returned again and again to the fancy of those who had only once beheld it , they could scarcely have recalled a single feature , feeling only the almost angelic expression of the whole . His brother , as full of mirth and mischief , and as noisy and laughter - loving as Herbert was quiet and thoughtful , made his way at once , winning regard by storm , and retaining it by his frank and generous qualities , which made him a favorite with young and old . Even in his hours of study , there was not the least evidence of reflection or soberness . As a child he had had much to contend with , in the way of passion , pride , and self - will ; but his home influence had been such a judicious blending of indulgence and firmness on the part of both his parents , such a persevering inculcation of a strong sense of duty , religious and moral , that at fifteen his difficulties had been all nearly overcome ; and , except when occasional acts of thoughtlessness and hasty impulse lured him into error and its painful consequences , he was as happy and as good a lad as even his anxious mother could desire . The elder of his two sisters resembled him in the bright , dark , flashing eye , the straight intellectual brow , the rich dark brown hair and well - formed mouth ; but the expression was so different at present , that it was often difficult to trace the likeness that actually existed . Haughtiness , and but too often ill - temper , threw a shade over a countenance , which when happy and animated was not only attractive then , but gave a fair promise of great beauty in after years . The disposition of Caroline Hamilton was in fact naturally so similar to that of her aunt , Mrs. Fortescue , that Mrs. Hamilton 's task with her was not only more difficult and painful in the present than with any of the others , but her dread of the future at times so overpowering , that it required all her husband 's influence to calm her , by returning trust in Him , who had promised to answer all who called upon Him , and would bless that mother 's toils which were based on , and looked up alone , to His influence on her child , and guidance for herself . The blue - eyed , fair - haired , graceful , little Emmeline , not only the youngest of the family , but , from her slight figure , delicate , small features , and childish manner , appearing even much younger than she was , was indeed a source of joy and love to all , seeming as if sorrow , except for others , could not approach her . She had indeed much that required a carefully guiding hand , in a yielding weakness of disposition , indolent habit in learning , an unrestrained fancy , and its general accompaniment , over - sensitiveness of feeling , but so easily guided by affection , and with a disposition so sweet and gentle , that a word from her mother was always enough . Mrs. Hamilton had little fears for her , except , indeed , as for the vast capability of individual suffering which such a disposition engendered , in those trials which it was scarcely possible she might hope to pass through life without . There was only one safeguard , one unfailing comfort , for a character like hers , and that was a deep ever - present sense of religion , which untiringly , and yet more by example than by precept , her parents endeavored to instill . Greatly , indeed , would both Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton have been astonished , had they been told that the little girl , Ellen Fortescue , who to both was such an enigma , and who was seemingly in all things so utterly unlike their Emmeline , was in natural disposition exactly the same ; and that the vast difference in present and future character simply arose from the fact , that the early influences of the one were sorrow and neglect , and of the other , happiness and love . "
30472	30499	30502	30502	they	878	" observed Caroline , after several minutes of unbroken silence , all seemingly so engrossed in their own occupations as to have no inclination to speak . "

30535	30551	30531	30533	my sage sister	880	" replied Percy , without , however , raising his head or interrupting his writing ; "

30766	30779	30782	30782	you	880	" rejoined Emmeline , with a very arch look at her brother . "
30836	30864	30865	30865	You	880	" And he mingled all the fixed and unfixed parts of her map in most bewildering confusion , regardless of her laughing entreaty to let them alone . "
30879	30883	30884	30884	you	880	" continued Caroline ; "

31012	31017	31003	31003	your	880	" replied Caroline haughtily ; "

31044	31050	31040	31040	me	0	" rejoined Emmeline , earnestly ; "

31207	31208	31209	31209	I	0	" "

31392	31406	31378	31378	I	0	" observed Herbert , looking up from his book with a bright smile . "

31633	31689	31701	31701	you	909	" He placed his writing on his brother 's open bunk , threw his dictionary and grammar high in air , and dexterously caught them as they fell , piled up his books , closed his desk , and then , with a comical sigh of relief , flung himself full length on a sofa . "
31722	31726	31716	31716	you	909	" inquired Caroline . "
31763	31764	31760	31760	her	112	" "
31767	31774	31760	31760	her	112	" answered Miss Harcourt , laughing ; "

31952	31956	31947	31947	Caroline	122	" replied Emmeline ; "

32163	32164	32155	32155	mamma	3420	" "
32168	32173	32155	32155	mamma	3420	" replied Miss Harcourt . "

32349	32357	32322	32322	I	0	" Emmeline hesitated , then answered ingenuously , "
32387	32388	32392	32392	you	130	" "
32404	32417	32423	32423	Tiny	130	" exclaimed her brother , starting up and sitting on her chair ; "
32432	32433	32423	32423	Tiny	130	" "
32446	32465	32442	32442	Percy	99	" she replied , looking so fondly in his face , that he gave her a hearty kiss . "
32497	32498	32486	32486	I	0	" "
32542	32543	32518	32518	you	122	" "

32567	32572	32575	32575	you	122	" replied Percy quickly , "
32629	32630	32633	32633	she	3420	" "
32636	32644	32645	32645	she	3420	" replied Caroline , very much provoked , "
32686	32687	32699	32700	Lady Helen	127	" "
32777	32778	32779	32779	Percy	99	" "

32822	32823	32824	32824	I	0	" "
32853	32859	32835	32835	I	0	" replied his sister angrily . "
32877	32882	32874	32875	dear Caroline	122	" observed Herbert gently ; "
33011	33012	33013	33013	Brother	391	" "
33050	33051	33052	33052	Caroline	122	" "
33061	33073	33052	33052	Caroline	122	" exclaimed Percy , with a most provoking fit of laughter . "
33129	33130	33107	33107	you	122	" "
33143	33147	33107	33107	you	122	" rejoined Herbert . "
33182	33183	33184	33184	I	0	" "
33195	33199	33184	33184	I	0	" interrupted Caroline , "
33209	33210	33207	33207	Herbert	102	" "
33233	33473	33226	33226	you	102	" interposed Percy , perceiving with regret the expression of pain on his brother 's face , and always ready to guard him either from physical or mental suffering , feeling instinctively that , from his extraordinary mind and vivid sense of duty , he was liable to the latter , from many causes which other natures would pass unnoticed . Miss Harcourt did not join the conversation . It had always been Mrs. Hamilton 's wish that in their intercourse with each other , her children should be as unrestrained as if they had been alone . Had Caroline 's sentiments received encouragement , she would have interfered ; but the raillery of Percy and the earnestness of Herbert , she knew were more likely to produce an effect than any thing like a rebuke from herself , which would only have caused restraint before her in future . It was through this perfect unrestraint that Mrs. Hamilton had become so thoroughly acquainted with the several characters of her children . That Caroline 's sentiments caused her often real pain was true , but it was far better to know them , and endeavor to correct and remove them , by causing education to bear upon the faults they revealed , than to find them concealed from her by the constant fear of words of reproof . To remove Herbert 's unusual seriousness , Percy continued , laughingly — "
33526	33527	33516	33516	Ellen	113	" "
33604	33605	33624	33624	Emmy	121	" "
33718	33719	33720	33721	Dear Percy	99	" "
33729	33735	33727	33727	reverend	983	" said Herbert , appealingly : "
33758	33759	33760	33760	You	99	" "
33825	33826	33828	33828	I	0	" "
33882	33883	33875	33875	you	99	" "
33929	33930	33936	33936	Percy	99	" "
33938	33944	33945	33945	I	0	" repeated Emmeline , laughing ; "
33958	33959	33945	33945	I	0	" "
33984	34063	33976	33976	I	0	" and Percy bounded from the table so impetuously as nearly to upset it , flung back the curtain , and looked eagerly from the window . Herbert closed his book to listen ; Emmeline left her nearly - completed map , and joined Percy ; Caroline evidently tried to resume serenity , but , too proud to evince it , industriously pursued her work , breaking the thread almost every time that she drew out the needle . "
34077	34087	34088	34088	My	0	" said Herbert , in a tone of regret . "
34130	34131	34134	34134	Percy	99	" "
34141	34142	34134	34134	Percy	99	" "
34209	34741	34176	34176	Hurrah	133	" And with noisy impatience , the young gentleman ran into the hall , assembled all the servants he had named , and others too , all eager to welcome the travelers ; flung wide back the massive door , and he and Herbert both were on the steps several minutes before the carriage came in sight . If more than the preceding conversation were needed to reveal the confidence and love with which Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton were regarded by their children , the delight , the unrestrained expressions of affection , with which by every one of the young party they were received , would have evinced it still more clearly . Herbert was very speedily on his favorite seat , a low stool at his mother 's feet . Emmeline , for that one half hour at least , assumed her still unresigned privilege , as the youngest and tiniest , to quietly slip in her lap ; Percy was talking to his father , making Edward perfectly at home , saying many kind words to Ellen , and caressing his mother , all almost at the same moment . Caroline was close to her father , with her arm round his neck ; and Miss Harcourt was kindly disrobing Ellen from her many wraps , and making her lie quietly on a sofa near her aunt ; who , even in that moment of delightful reunion with her own , had yet time and thought , by a few judicious words , to remove the undefinable , but painful sensation of loneliness , which was creeping over the poor child as she gazed on her bright , happy - looking cousins ; and thought if to her own mother Edward 's beauty and happiness had made him so much more beloved than herself , what claim could she have on her aunt ? Ellen could not have said that such were the thoughts that filled her eyes with tears , and made her heart so heavy ; she only knew that much as she had loved her aunt during the journey , her kiss and kind words at that moment made her love her more than ever . Never had there been a happier meal at Oakwood than the substantial tea which was speedily ready for the travelers . So much was there to hear and tell : Percy 's wild sallies ; Caroline 's animated replies ( she had now quite recovered her temper ) ; Herbert 's gentle care of Ellen , by whom he had stationed himself ( even giving up to her his usual seat by his mother ) ; Emmeline 's half shy , half eager , efforts to talk to her cousins ; Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton 's earnest interest , all combined , long before the meal was concluded , to make Edward feel perfectly at his ease , and very happy , and greatly to remove Ellen 's unacknowledged dread . The time passed so quickly , that there was a general start when the prayer bell sounded , though it was nearly two hours after the usual time . "
34753	34797	34800	34800	papa	3546	" Mr. Hamilton asked of Herbert , as they rose to adjourn to the library , where , morning and evening , it had been the custom of the Hamilton family for many generations , to assemble their whole household for family devotion . "
34815	34816	34800	34800	papa	3546	" "
34842	38372	38373	38373	mamma	3420	" replied his father , linking his son 's arm in his , and affectionately glancing on the bright blush that rose to the boy 's cheek . There was a peculiar sweetness in Herbert Hamilton 's voice , even in speaking ; and as he read the service of the lessons for the evening , adding one or two brief explanations when necessary , and more especially when reading , or rather praying , the beautiful petitions appropriated to family worship , there was an earnest solemnity of tone and manner , presenting a strange contrast , yet beautiful , combining with the boyish form and youthful face , on which the lamp , suspended over the reading - desk shed such a soft and holy light . The occasional prayer which was added to the usual evening service , was always chosen by the reader ; and Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton were surprised and affected at the earnestness with which their almost angel boy selected and read over one peculiarly bearing on the events of that evening ; the introduction of their orphan relatives , for compassion and blessing on them , and grace for increased kindness and forbearance in their intercourse with one another — Miss Harcourt , his brother and sisters , knew well to what he alluded , and all but one responded with earnestness and truth . Caroline could not enter into Herbert 's feelings even at that moment : it was a great effort to prevent a feeling of irritation , believing that he directly pointed at her , and determining that as neither he nor any one else had any right to interfere with her private thoughts , and that they could do harm to none while confined to her own breast , she resolved not to overcome them , and so could not join with any fervor in the prayer . To Edward all was strange . While the graces of his body and mind had been most sedulously cultivated , he had never been taught even the public ordinances of religion , much less its inward spirit . His mother had often and often felt a pang of reproach , at thus neglecting that which an inward voice would whisper was most essential ; but she was wo nt to silence the pang by the determined idea , that she was neither worthy nor able to give him such solemn lessons , and that it would come by instinct to him in after years . There was time enough for him to think of such things . He had been now and then to church , but it was a mere form , regarded as a weary duty , from which he escaped whenever he could . The present scene , then , completely bewildered him . He had always fancied himself superior to any of the boys he had associated with ; but as he looked at and listened to Herbert , who seemed at most only two years older than himself , he became sensible of a very strange and disagreeable , but a very decided feeling of inferiority : and then , too , it was so incomprehensible the servants all joining them , a class of people whom in India he had been taught so to consider his inferiors , that even to speak with them was a species of degradation ; and he was destined to be still more surprised , for before they left the library , he heard his aunt and uncle address them all , and say a few kind words , and make inquiries after their families to each . To Ellen that evening service recalled some of Mr. Myrvin 's instructions , and seemed to help her to realize those new thoughts and feelings , which she had learned , for the first time , in Wales . Her father had , indeed , the last year of his life tried to give her some ideas of religion ; but having only so very lately begun to think seriously himself , he felt diffident and uncertain of his own powers , and so left an impression more of awe toward the subject than of love , which to a disposition such as Ellen 's was unfortunate . A very short time sufficed for Percy and Emmeline to introduce their cousins to all the delights and mysteries of their dear old home : and Oakwood Hall was really a place for imagination to revel in . It was a large castelated mansion , fraught with both the associations of the past , and the comforts of the present . The injuries which the original mansion had received during the civil war of Charles I. , had , when the family returned at the Restoration , caused much of the old house to be pulled down , and replaced with larger rooms , and greater conveniences for a modern dwelling - house , retaining , however , quite sufficient of the past to throw interest around it . The wings were still flanked with turrets , which were Percy 's and Emmeline 's delight ; and the many stair - cases , leading into all sorts of nooks and corners — and the small and most uncomfortable rooms , because some of them happened to be hung with tapestry , and had those small narrow windows sunk in deep recesses — were pronounced by both far more enjoyable than the beautiful suite of rooms forming the center of the mansion , and the dwelling of the family . These were only saved from being disagreeably modern — Percy would declare — by their beautiful richly - polished oaken panels , and by the recesses which the large windows still formed , making almost a room by themselves . The hall , too , with its superb sweep of staircase and broad carved oaken balustrade , leading to a gallery above , which opened on the several sleeping apartments , and thus permitting the full height of the mansion , from base to roof , to be visible from the hall . Tho doors visible in the gallery opened mostly on dressing - rooms , or private sitting - rooms , which led to the large , airy sleeping - rooms , to which the servants had access by back stair - cases leading from their hall ; and so leaving the oaken staircase and gallery entirely to the use of the family , and of many a game of noisy play had that gallery been the scene . There had been a beautiful little chapel adjoining the mansion , but it was mercilessly burned to the ground by the infatuated Puritans , and never restored ; the venerable old church of the village henceforth serving the family of the hall . Situated on the banks of the Dart , whose serpentine windings gave it the appearance of a succession of most lovely lakes , Nature had been so lavish of her beauties in the garden and park , especially in the magnificent growth of the superb oaks , from which the estate took its name , that it was not much wonder Mrs. Hamilton , always an intense lover of nature , should have become so attached to her home , as never to feel the least inclination to leave it . She did not wish her girls to visit London till a few months before Caroline was old enough to be introduced , to give them then finishing masters ; and to that time she of course always looked , as demanding from her part of the year to be spent in town . The career of Eleanor , the recollections of the frivolity and error into which her own early youth had been thrown , had given her not only a distaste , but an actual dread of London for her girls , till such principles and associations had been instilled which would enable them to pass through the ordeal of successive seasons without any change of character or feeling . Her sons , since their tenth year , had more than once accompanied their father to the metropolis ; but though these visits were always sources of enjoyment , especially to Percy , they never failed to return with unabated affection to their home , and to declare there was no place in England like it . Mr. Hamilton , though in neither profession nor business , was far from being an idle man . His own estate was sufficiently large , and contained a sufficient number of dependents , for whose mortal and immortal welfare he was responsible , to give him much employment ; and in addition to this , the home interests and various aspects of his country were so strongly entwined with his very being — that , though always refusing to enter Parliament , he was the prompter and encourager of many a political movement , having for its object amelioration of the poor , and improvement of the whole social system ; closely connected with which , as he was , they gave him neither public fame nor private emolument . He acted in all things from the same single - hearted integrity and high honor which caused him to refuse the title proffered to his father . Her husband 's connection with many celebrated characters , and her own correspondence , and occasional visits from her friends to Oakwood , prevented Mrs. Hamilton 's interest from too complete concentration in her home , as , in her first retirement , many feared . She had , too , some friends near her , whose society gave her both pleasure and interest ; and many acquaintances who would have visited more than she felt any inclination for , had she not had the happy power of quietly pursuing her own path , and yet conciliating all . The Rev. William Howard had accepted Mr. Hamilton 's eagerly - proffered invitation to become his rector , and undertake the education of his boys , from very peculiar circumstances . He had been minister of a favorite church in one of the southern towns , and master of an establishment for youths of high rank , in both which capacities he had given universal satisfaction . The reprehensible conduct of some of his pupils , carried on at first so secretly as to elude his knowledge , at length became so notorious as to demand examination . He had at first refused all credence , but when proved , by the confused replies of all , and half confession of some , he briefly and emphatically laid before them the enormity of their conduct , and declared that , as confidence was entirely broken between them , he would resign the honor of their education , refusing to admit them any longer as members of his establishment . In vain the young men implored him to spare them the disgrace of such an expulsion ; he was inexorable . This conduct , in itself so upright , was painted by the smarting offenders in such colors , that Mr. Howard gradually but surely found his school abandoned , and himself so misrepresented , that a spirit less self - possessed and secure in its own integrity must have sunk beneath it . But he had some true friends , and none more active and earnest than Mr. Hamilton . A very brief residence at Oakwood Rectory removed even the recollection of the injustice he had experienced ; and he himself , as pastor and friend , proved a treasure to high and low . Ten other youths , sons of the neighboring gentry , became his pupils , their fathers gladly following in Mr. Hamilton 's lead . About a mile and a half across the park was Moorlands , the residence of Lady Helen Grahame , whose name had been so often mentioned by the young Hamiltons . Her husband Montrose Grahame , had been Arthur Hamilton 's earliest friend , at home , at college , and in manhood . Lady Helen the youngest daughter of a marquis , had been intimate with Emmeline and Eleanor Manvers from childhood , and had always admired and wished to resemble the former , but always failed , she believed , from being constituted so differently ; others might have thought from her utter want of energy and mental strength . The marriage at first appeared likely to be a happy one , but it was too soon proved the contrary . Grahame was a man of strict , perhaps severe principles ; his wife , though she never did any thing morally wrong , scarcely knew the meaning of the word . Provoked with himself for his want of discrimination , in imagining Lady Helen so different to the being she really was ; more than once discovering she did not speak the exact truth , or act with the steady uprightness he demanded , his manner became almost austere ; and , in consequence , becoming more and more afraid of him , Lady Helen sunk lower and lower in his esteem . Two girls and a boy were the fruits of this union . Lady Helen had made a great many excellent resolutions with regard to their rearing and education , which she eagerly confided to Mrs. Hamilton , but when the time of trial came , weakness and false indulgence so predominated , that Grahame , to counteract these evil influences , adopted a contrary extreme , and , by a system of constant reserve and severity , became an object of as much terror to his children as he was to his wife . But he did not pursue this conduct without pain , and never did he visit Oakwood without bitter regret that his home was not the same . Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton had often tried to alter the aspect of affairs at Moorlands ; the former , by entreating Grahame to be less severe ; the latter , by urging Lady Helen to a firmer mode of conduct . But those friendly efforts were as yet entirely useless . Grahame became a member of Parliament , which took his family to London for five or six months in the year — a particularly agreeable change to Lady Helen , who then associated with her sisters , whose families were conducted much on the same fashion as her own , but unfortunately only increasing the discomfort of Moorlands when they returned to it . And this was the more to be regretted , from the fact that both Grahame and his wife were full of good intentions , and had the one been more yielding , and the other more firm , there might have been no small share of happiness for both . But heavy as Lady Helen thought her trial in the want of her husband 's confidence and love , and which she had greatly brought upon herself , it was light in comparison with that of Mrs. Greville , another near neighbor and valued friend of Mrs. Hamilton . She had loved and married a man whose winning manners and appearance , and an ever - varying flow of intelligent conversation , had completely concealed , till too late , his real character . Left at a very early age his own master , with a capital estate and large fortune ; educated at a very large public school , at which he learned literally nothing but vice , and how effectually to conceal it ; courted and flattered wherever he went , he became vain , overbearing , and extravagant ; with no pursuit but that of gambling in all its varieties , even hunting and shooting could not be thoroughly enjoyed without some large bets depending on the day 's sport : his thoughts from boyhood were so completely centered in self , that he had affection for nothing else . He had indeed fancied he loved Jessie Summers , when he had so successfully wooed her ; but the illusion was speedily dispelled , and repeatedly he cursed his folly for plaguing himself with a wife . His first child , too , was a girl and that annoyed him still more ; and when , the next year , a boy was granted , he certainly rejoiced , but it was such rejoicing as to fill his wife 's heart with an agony of dread ; for he swore he would make his boy as jovial a spirit as himself , and that her namby - pamby ideas should have nothing to do with him . It was indeed a difficult and painful task Mrs. Greville had to perform . Though her husband would spend weeks and even months at a time away , the impressions she so earnestly and prayerfully sought to instill into her son 's heart were , or appeared to be , completely destroyed by her husband 's interference the whole time of his sojourn at his home . It was his pleasure to thwart her every plan , laugh at her fine notions , make a mockery of all that was good , and holy , and self denying ; and all in the presence of his children ; succeeding in making Alfred frequently guilty of disrespect and unkindness , but failing entirely with Mary , who , though of such a fragile frame and gentle spirit that her father 's visits almost always caused her a fit of illness , so idolized her suffering but never murmuring mother , that she only redoubled her attention and respect whenever she saw her more tried than usual . This conduct , of course , only made her an object , equally with her mother , of her father 's sneers and taunts , but she bore it with the true spirit of a martyr . Suffering was doing for her what Herbert Hamilton was naturally — making her spiritual and thoughtful far beyond her years , and drawing her and Herbert together with such a bond of mutual reverence and sympathy , that to talk to him was her greatest consolation , and to endeavor to lessen her sorrows one of his dearest pleasures . Alfred was not naturally an evil - disposed boy , and when his father was from home seldom failed either in respect or obedience . Mrs. Greville possessed the rather rare combination of extreme submissiveness with a natural dignity and firmness , which enabled her to retain the reverence and sympathy of her friends and her household , without once stooping to receive their pity . It was generally supposed by those who did not know her personally , that she was one of those too soft and self - denying characters who bring on themselves the evils they deplore ; but this in Mrs. Greville 's case was a very great mistake . It was impossible to associate even casually with her , without feeling intuitively that she suffered deeply , but the emotion such conviction called was respect alone . As anxious and as earnest a parent as Mrs. Hamilton herself , Mrs. Greville failed not to inculcate the good in both her children , and still more forcibly , when they became old enough to observe , by example than by precept . But with Alfred there must have been an utter hopelessness as to the fruit of her anxious labors , had she not possessed that clinging , single - hearted trust which taught her that no difficulty should deter from a simple duty , and that nothing was too hard for Him who — if He saw that she shrunk not from the charge and responsibility which , in permitting her to become a mother , he had given , and did all she could to counteract those evil influences , for the removal of which she had no power — would , in His own good time , reward , if not on earth — with Him in Heaven ; and so untiringly , as unmurmuringly , she struggled on . The part of the day which to Emmeline Hamilton was the happiest of all , was that in which she and Caroline , and now , of course , Ellen , were with their mother alone . Not that she particularly liked the very quiet employment of plain work , which was then their usual occupation , but that she could talk without the least restraint , either about her lessons , or her pleasures , or her thoughts , and the stories or histories she had been reading , and if she thought wrong no one ever corrected her so delightfully so impressively as "
38375	39324	38373	38373	mamma	3420	" The mornings , from three to four hours , according as their age and studies required , were always under the control of Miss Harcourt , with such visits from Mrs. Hamilton as gave an increased interest to exertion , and such interruption only as permitted their practice and lessons in music , which three times a week Mrs. Hamilton had as yet herself bestowed . The dressing - bell always rung at half - past three , and dinner was at four , to allow the lads return from Mr. Howard 's , whose daily lessons commenced at nine and concluded at three . From half - past one to half - past three , in the very short days , was devoted to recreation , walking , or driving , and in the longer , to Emmeline 's favorite time — an hour at work with her mother , and the remainder to the preparation of lessons and exercises for the next day , which in the winter occupied from five to six . From six to seven in the same generally gloomy season they read aloud some entertaining book with their mother and Miss Harcourt , and seven was the delightful hour of a general reunion at tea , and signal for such recreation till nine as they felt inclined for ; their brothers having been employed for Mr. Howard part of the time between dinner and tea , with sufficient earnestness to enjoy the rest and recreation afterward , quite as buoyantly and gladly as their sisters ; and many a merry dance enlivened their winter evenings . In the summer , of course , this daily routine was frequently varied by most delightful excursions in the country . Mrs. Hamilton earnestly longing to implant a love of Nature and all its fresh , pure associations in the minds of her children while yet young , knowing that once obtained , the pleasures of the world would be far less likely to obtain too powerful dominion . That which the world often terms romance , she felt to be a high , pure sense of poetry in the Universe and in Man , which she was quite as anxious to instill as many mothers to root out . She did not believe that to cultivate the spiritual needed the banishment of the matter of fact ; but she believed , that to infuse the latter with the former would be their best and surest preventive against all that was low and mean ; their best help in the realization of a constant unfailing piety . For the same reason she cultivated a taste for the beautiful , not only in her girls , but in her boys — and beauty , not in arts and nature alone , but in character . She did not allude to beauty of merely the high and striking kind , but to the lowly virtues , struggles , faith , and heroism in the poor — their forbearance and kindness to one another — marking something to admire , even in the most rugged and surly , that at first sight would seem so little worthy of notice . It was gradually , and almost unconsciously , to accustom her daughters to such a train of thought and sentiment , that she so particularly laid aside one part of the day to have them with her alone ; ostensibly , it was to give part of their day to working for the many poor , to whom gifts of ready - made clothing are sometimes much more valuable than money ; but the education of that one hour she knew might , for the right cultivation of the heart , do more than the mere teaching of five or six , and that education , much as she loved and valued Miss Harcourt , she had from the first resolved should come from her alone . To Emmeline this mode of life was so happy , she could not imagine any thing happier . But Caroline often and often envied her great friend Annie Grahame , and believed that occasional visits to London would make her much happier than remaining all the year round at Oakwood , and only with her own family . She knew the expression of such sentiments would meet no sympathy at home , and certainly not obtain their gratification , so she tried to check them , except when in company with Annie and Lady Helen ; but her mother knew them , and , from the discontent and unhappiness they so often engendered in her child , caused her both pain and uneasiness . But she did not waver in her plans , because only in Emmeline they seemed to succeed : nor did she , as perhaps some over - scrupulous mothers would have done , check Caroline 's association with Miss Grahame . She knew that those principles must be indeed of little worth , which could only actuate in retirement , and when free from temptation . That to prevent intimacy with all , except with those of whom she exactly approved , would be impossible , if she ever meant her daughters to enter the world ; and therefore she endeavored so to obtain their unrestrained confidence and affection , as to be regarded , both now and when they were young women , as their first , best , and truest friend ; and that end obtained , intimacies with their young companions , however varied their character , she felt would do no permanent harm . "
39330	39354	39327	39328	dear mamma	3422	" exclaimed Emmeline , one morning about a week after her parents ' return , and dropping her work to speak more eagerly , "
39436	39437	39430	39430	I	0	" "
39450	39451	39454	39454	he	99	" "
39550	39551	39541	39541	they	1012	" "
39570	39577	39565	39565	you	3420	" replied her sister , ingenuously ; "
39621	39622	39623	39623	I	0	" "
39641	39642	39635	39635	you	120	" "
39699	39707	39694	39694	I	0	" and her eyes filled with tears . "
39870	39871	39846	39847	Mrs. Greville	140	" "
39979	39980	39981	39981	She	140	" "
39996	39997	39994	39994	Emmy	121	" "
40031	40032	40033	40033	You	1027	" "
40101	40220	40097	40097	you	1027	" Emmeline eagerly obeyed , painting her friend in such glowing colors , that Ellen felt , however tried she might be , a person so good and holy must be happy , notwithstanding ; besides , to be loved so by Mrs. Hamilton and Herbert , discovered to her mind such superior qualities , that she almost wondered how Emmeline could speak of her so familiarly , and think of her as her own particular friend . But the conversation on her , and then on other topics , so interested her , that she was almost as sorry as her cousin , when it was interrupted by a visit from Lady Helen Grahame and her daughter . "
40228	40249	40097	40097	you	1027	" was the former 's lively greeting , and evincing far more warmth of manner than was usual to her . "
40283	40284	40285	40285	I	0	" "
40307	40317	40285	40285	I	0	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , in the same tone ; "
40332	40333	40330	40330	Helen	127	" "
40396	40421	40428	40428	you	78	" she added , more seriously , as she glanced on the deep mourning of her friend , and indeed of all the group ; "
40454	40455	40456	40456	I	0	" "
40490	40507	40488	40488	Annie	129	" she continued , addressing Miss Grahame , who was already deep in conversation with Caroline , "
40533	40613	40531	40531	Emmeline	78	" The young lady turned round at the words , but her sole notice of Ellen , who had come timidly forward , was a haughty stare , a fashionable courtesy , and a few unintelligible words , which caused Emmeline to feel so indignant , that it was with difficulty she kept silence , and made Ellen so uncomfortable , that it was with even more than her usual shyness , she received Lady Helen 's proffered hand . "
40659	40780	40656	40656	you	129	" Ellen might have found courage to reply for there was an interest attached to all who had known her mother ; but as she raised her eyes to speak , she again encountered Annie 's rude and disagreeable stare , and the words died on her lips . The young party were , however , soon all in the garden , for Mrs. Hamilton never made any scruple in dismissing her children , when she wished to speak on subjects she did not choose them to hear ; and she was anxious so to relate Eleanor 's illness and change of sentiment , as to remove the impressions which her early career had left on Lady Helen 's memory . "
40816	40873	40806	40806	Edward	76	" was Emmeline 's affectionate address , as Annie and Caroline turned in a different direction ; and generally judging others by herself , she thought that being Edward 's first day of regular attendance on Mr. Howard , Ellen would like to know all about it as soon as possible , and they proceeded accordingly . "
40889	40903	40904	40904	Edward	76	" inquired Miss Grahame , the moment she had Caroline entirely to herself . "
40949	40950	40939	40939	Annie	129	" "
40984	40985	40986	40986	Mamma	80	" "
41016	41017	41006	41006	Ellen	113	" "
41076	41077	41063	41063	Mamma	80	" "
41085	41091	41078	41078	Mamma	80	" replied Caroline , thoughtfully ; "
41113	41114	41101	41101	Ellen	113	" "
41166	41167	41155	41155	you	0	" "
41253	41254	41244	41244	I	0	" "
41258	41259	41244	41244	I	0	" "
41282	41283	41274	41274	she	3420	" "
41305	41306	41288	41289	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" "
41312	41319	41307	41307	Mamma	80	" replied Caroline , with spirit ; "
41337	41338	41333	41333	you	129	" "
41397	41967	42012	42012	She	1065	" and the caress with which she concluded restored Caroline 's serenity , and other subjects were discussed between them . Annie Grahame was a few months younger than Caroline Hamilton ( who was nearly thirteen , ) but from having been emancipated from the nursery and school - room at a very early age , and made her mother 's companion and confidant in all her home vexations — very pretty and engaging — she was very much noticed , and her visits to her titled relations in London , by causing her to imitate their fashionable manners , terms of speech , thoughts on dress , and rank , & c. , made her a woman many years before her time ; and though to Lady Helen 's family and to Lady Helen herself this made her still more agreeable , from becoming so very companionable ; to Mrs. Hamilton , and to all , in fact , who loved childhood for childhood 's sake , it was a source of real regret , as banishing all the freshness and artlessness and warmth which ought to have been the characteristics of her age . Her father was the only one of her own family who did not admire — and so tried to check — this assumption of fine ladyism , on the part of his daughter ; but it was not likely he could succeed , and he only estranged from him the affections of his child . Annie Grahame had a great many fashionable acquaintances in London , but she still regarded Caroline Hamilton as her favorite friend . Why , she could not exactly tell , except that it was so very , very delightful to have some one in the country to whom she could dilate on all the pleasures of London , display her new dresses , new music , drawings , work , & c. ( not however considering it at all necessary to mention that her work and drawings were only half her own , and Caroline was much too truthful herself to imagine it , and her mother too anxious to retain that guileless simplicity to enlighten her , as she was well capable of doing ) . Annie 's quick eye discovered that at such times Caroline certainly envied her , and she imagined she must be a person of infinite consequence to excite such a feeling , and this was such a pleasant sensation , that she sought Caroline as much as possible during their stay at Moorlands . Of Mrs. Hamilton , indeed , she stood in such uncomfortable awe , though that lady never addressed her except in kindness , that as she grew older , it actually became dislike ; but this only increased her intimacy with Caroline , whom she had determined should be as unlike her mother as possible ; and as this friendship was the only one of his daughter 's sentiments which gave Mr. Grahame unmixed satisfaction , he encouraged it by bringing them together as often as he could . Emmeline and Ellen , meanwhile , had pursued their walk in silence , both engrossed with their own thoughts ( for that children of eleven years , indeed , of any age , do not think , because when asked what they are thinking about , their answer is invariably "
41970	42011	42012	42012	She	1065	" is one of those mistaken notions which modern education is , we hope , exploding ) . Emmeline was so indignant with Annie that she felt more sure than ever that she did not and could never like her . "
42073	42279	42068	42068	I	0	" was the tenor of her meditations . But Ellen , though Annie 's greeting had caused her to shrink still more into herself , and so produced pain , was not thinking only of her . The whole of that hour 's intimate association with Mrs. Hamilton had puzzled her ; she had doted on her father — she was sure she loved her aunt almost as dearly , but could she ever have given words to that affection as Emmeline had done , and as Edward always did ? and so , perhaps , after all , she did not feel as they did , though the wish was so strong to caress her aunt , and sit as close and lovingly by her as Herbert and Emmeline and even Edward did , that its very indulgence seemed to give her pain . Then Caroline 's confession too — could she ever have had courage to confess the indulgence of a feeling which she knew to be wrong — and all her aunt had said both to Caroline and Emmeline so fastened on her mind as to make her head ache , and she quite started when a loud shout sounded near them . "
42285	42290	42283	42283	Percy	99	" said Emmeline laughing ; "
42308	42362	42363	42363	Holla	149	" And so they were ; laughing , shouting , panting , they came full speed , darting in and out the trees in every variety of mathematical figures their ingenuity could frame ; but as soon as Percy 's restless eye discovered Emmeline , he directed his course toward her , exclaiming , "
42402	42403	42404	42404	Ellen	113	" "
42473	42474	42444	42444	he	128	" "
42500	42589	42491	42491	you	130	" asked Ellen , clinging to his arm , and looking in his face with such an expression that there was little trace of ill - temper . Emmeline meanwhile had made her brother a party in her indignation against Annie 's pride , which he termed insolence , vowing he would make her feel it . And as they came in sight of her and Caroline , he called out to Ellen , who , all her timidity returning , tried to draw Edward into another walk . "
42642	42844	42628	42628	mamma	3420	" And Edward did not wait a second bidding , leaving Ellen to Percy , who threw his arm affectionately round her , and began talking to her so amusingly that she could not help laughing , and so devoted did he appear to her , that he had only time to greet Miss Grahame , with a very marked and polite bow , and passed on . He wished to provoke , and he succeeded , for Annie was always particularly pleased when the handsome , spirited Percy Hamilton paid her any attention , and that he should be so devoted to his little pale , disagreeable - looking cousin , as not even to give her a word , annoyed her as much as he desired . Edward 's hasty progress to his aunt was slightly checked at seeing a stranger with her , but when he was introduced he made his bow with so much of his mother 's grace , that , combined with the extraordinary likeness , and her feelings already interested in Mrs. Hamilton 's account of her sister 's sufferings and death , Lady Helen could not for the moment speak except to exclaim , "
42865	42866	42860	42860	herself	127	" "
42877	42892	42871	42871	you	1074	" said Edward , with so much eagerness that his cheeks crimsoned and his voice trembled.—"Were
42896	42917	42860	42860	herself	127	mamma's"—but he could not finish the sentence , and leaning his head against his aunt , he burst into tears . "
42921	43312	43313	43313	I	0	" said Lady Helen pityingly , as Mrs. Hamilton pressed him closer to her , and stooped down to kiss his forehead without speaking ; and that sudden and unexpected display of feeling contrasted with Ellen 's painful shyness , stamped at once and indelibly Lady Helen 's opinion of the two orphans . A few days more brought Mrs. Greville and Mary to welcome their friends , and Ellen had again the pain of being introduced to strangers ; but this time it was only the pain of her own shyness , for could she have overcome that feeling , she might have felt even pleasure . As it was , the gentle voice and manner with which Mrs. Greville addressed her , and the timid yet expressive glance of Mary , told of such sympathy and kindness , that she felt attracted toward both , and could quite enter into Emmeline 's enthusiastic admiration of her friend ; not , however , believing it possible that she herself could ever be worthy to win Mary 's regard . Taught from such a very early age to believe herself so far inferior to Edward , such characters as Herbert and Mary appeared to her so exalted , that it was quite impossible they could ever think of her ; the constant little acts of unobtrusive kindness that her cousin showed her , she attributed to his extreme goodness , not from the most trifling merit in herself . She did indeed love him very dearly , the best next to her aunt ; but so much of reverence mingled with it , that she was almost more reserved with him than with the others . But Herbert was naturally reserved himself in words , and so he did not think any thing about it , except to wish and endeavor to make his little cousin happier than she seemed . When contrasting Mary Greville with Annie Grahame , as she was rather fond of doing , Emmeline became so afraid she was disliking the latter more than she ought to do , that she never rested till she made an opportunity to confess all her feelings to her mother , and beg her to tell her if they were very wrong , and if she ought to like her . "
43336	43356	43328	43328	you	1077	" replied her mother , fondly , for there was something in Emmeline 's guileless confidence irresistibly claiming love . "
43471	43472	43477	43477	mamma	3420	" "
43487	43488	43491	43491	love	1084	" "
43517	43518	43493	43493	she	129	" "
43547	43554	43537	43537	you	1077	" asked Emmeline , very thoughtfully . "
43693	43694	43699	43699	mamma	3420	" "
43776	43777	43764	43764	I	0	" "
43968	44050	43950	43950	you	1101	" Emmeline 's only answer was to run eagerly for her little Bible , and with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes listen to her mother , as she turned to the fifteenth Psalm , and reading it through , particularly pointed out the third verse , and so explained it , as easily and happily to satisfy her child as to the Divine authority for all that she had said , and to stamp them still more forcibly on her memory . "
44067	44080	44053	44053	I	0	" she said , kissing the little earnest face upturned to hers . "
44115	44135	44105	44105	Ellen	113	" And again full of glee , the happy child bounded away , exclaiming , as she did so , "
44164	44995	44997	44997	he	1105	" But though any one who had seen her the next half hour might have fancied that a serious thought or sober task could not approach her , neither the conversation nor the Psalm was forgotten ; with Herbert 's explanatory assistance , she not only found the Psalm , but committed it to memory ; and the second Sunday after her conversation with her mother , repeated it so correctly and prettily to her father , as to give her the delight of his caressing approbation . Learning correctly by rote was always her greatest trial , for her vivid fancy and very versatile powers occasioned her actual lessons to be considered such drudgery , as to require a great effort on her part to retain them . The sense , indeed , if she understood it , she learned quickly enough ; but she preferred her own language to any one 's else , and Mrs. Hamilton had some difficulty in making her understand that in time of study she required correctness , and not fancy ; and that the attention which was necessary to conquer the words as well as the sense of the lesson , was much more important and valuable , however disagreeable it might seem , than the facility of changing the language to something prettier than the original . When , therefore , as in the present case , she voluntarily undertook , and conquered really a difficult task for a little lively girl , her parents had no scruple in giving the only reward she cared for — their approbation . It was in the bestowal of praise Mrs. Hamilton was compelled to be almost painfully guarded . She found that the least expression of unusual approbation caused Caroline to relax in her efforts , thinking she had done quite enough , and perniciously increasing her already too exalted ideas of herself . While to Emmeline it was the most powerful incentive to a continuance in improvement , and determined conquest of her faults . There was constantly a dread on the mother 's heart , that Caroline would one day accuse her of partiality , from the different measure of her approbation which she was compelled to bestow ; and yet painful as it was to persevere under such an impression , the future welfare of both was too precious to be risked for the gratification of the present . She was watching with delight Emmeline 's unrestrained enjoyment of her father 's caresses and lively conversation , in which Percy as usual joined — for Tiny , as he chose to call her , was his especial pet and plaything — when she was startled by a low and evidently suppressed sob near her ; Ellen was bending over a book of Bible - stories which Herbert had lent her , and her long ringlets completely concealed her face ; Miss Harcourt and Caroline both looked up surprised , but a rapid sign from Mrs. Hamilton prevented their making any remark . Herbert fixed his eyes pityingly on his little cousin as if wishing but not liking to address her . Edward was the only one of the party who moved . He was busily engaged in examining a large Noah 's ark , and speculating as to its resemblance to a ship , and its powers of floating , but after a few minutes ' apparent thought he left it , and sitting down on Ellen 's chair , put his arm round her , and begged her to find a picture of Noah 's ark , and see if it were at all like the toy . Cheered by his affection , she conquered with a strong effort the choking in her throat , and turned to the page , and tried to sympathize in his wonder if it really were like the vessel in which Noah was saved , and where he could have put all the animals . Mrs. Hamilton joined them , and without taking more notice of Ellen 's very pale cheeks and heavy eyes , than gently to put back the thick tresses that seemed to annoy her by their weight , gave them so much interesting information on the subject , and so delighted Edward with allowing him to drag down several books from the library to find out all they said about it , that two hours slipped away quite unconsciously ; and Ellen 's very painful feeling had been so soothed , that she could smile , and join Emmeline in making all the animals walk in grand procession to their temporary dwelling . But Mrs. Hamilton did not forget the child 's involuntary evidence of suffering , and vainly tried to imagine what at that moment could have caused it . Herbert seemed to think about it , too , for the next day she heard him ask Edward — "
45021	45022	45008	45008	he	1105	" "
45028	45034	45008	45008	he	1105	" was Edward 's reply : "
45143	45144	45138	45138	she	561	" "
45154	45159	45138	45138	she	561	" inquired his aunt . "
45186	45268	45173	45173	I	0	" Edward , with eager willingness , communicated all he knew , though , from his being so constantly with his mother , and Ellen so much left with her father and herself , that all was little enough ; adding , however , that after her very dangerous illness , when she was eight years old , he perfectly well remembered hearing some celebrated physician say to his father she would probably feel the effects of it all her life . "
45283	45287	45276	45276	mamma	80	" added Edward , "
45365	45490	45493	45493	I	0	" This childish explanation certainly told Mrs. Hamilton more than she had known before ; but that Ellen had witnessed the fearful scene of her father 's death was still concealed . Edward , as he grew older , though he did not know why , seemed to shrink from the subject , particularly that he had been at a ball the same awful night . A few days afterward , as Mrs. Hamilton was crossing the large hall on her way to the school - room — for so , spite of Percy 's determination that it should receive the more learned and refined appellation of studio , it was still called — she overheard Caroline 's voice , exclaiming in angry impatience — "
45537	45538	45529	45529	I	0	" "
45544	45550	45551	45551	She	113	" was Emmeline 's indignant reply "
45575	45576	45577	45577	You	120	" "
45616	45617	45620	45620	you	1115	" "
45630	45642	45620	45620	you	1115	" began Emmeline ; but Ellen 's beseeching voice interrupted her — "
45696	45746	45687	45688	aunt Emmeline	78	" Caroline had already quitted the room , and in her haste ran against her mother , who she instantly perceived had heard all she said . With a deep blush , she turned as to re - enter the school - room , but Mrs. Hamilton stopped her — "
45749	45755	45687	45688	aunt Emmeline	78	" she said , gravely , "
45839	45840	45841	45842	Dear mamma	3422	" "
45849	45922	45845	45845	you	3422	" asked Emmeline , very timidly , for though at Ellen 's reiterated entreaty she had left her , she felt it almost disrespect to run across the hall while her mother was speaking ; and the thought suddenly crossed her that , as she was quite sure Ellen was not idle though Miss Harcourt thought she was , her mother , by assisting her , might save her from increased displeasure . "
45953	46044	45946	45946	I	0	" And Emmeline ran away , quite happy , to try all she could to soothe Caroline , whose self - reproach had as usual terminated in a fit of ill - temper and anger against Ellen , instead of against herself . Mrs. Hamilton entered the school - room , and stood by Ellen so quietly that the child did not perceive her . Her attention was completely absorbed in her book ; but after a few minutes she suddenly pushed it from her , and exclaiming almost passionately : "
46065	46087	46057	46058	Miss Harcourt	112	angry"—and she gave way , for the first time since her arrival at Oakwood , to a violent burst of tears . "
46101	46114	46099	46099	Ellen	113	" inquired her aunt , kindly taking one hand from her face . "
46130	46131	46099	46099	Ellen	113	" "
46171	46172	46147	46148	Miss Harcourt	112	" "
46213	46214	46199	46199	I	0	" "
46238	46269	46223	46223	she	112	" replied the sobbing girl , longing , but not daring , to throw her arms round her aunt 's neck , and lean her aching head against her bosom . "
46277	46284	46272	46272	I	0	" replied her aunt , smiling ; "
46340	46341	46322	46322	me	0	" "
46348	46357	46322	46322	me	0	" replied Ellen , struggling with her tears . "
46439	46474	46475	46475	You	113	" and , as if frightened at her own confession , she hid her face in her aunt 's dress . Mrs. Hamilton lifted her into her lap , and kissed her without speaking . "
46489	46497	46487	46487	Ellen	113	" she said , after a pause , "
46529	46530	46518	46518	I	0	" "
46560	46569	46570	46570	He	3546	" the word was almost choked with sobs . "
46655	46676	46623	46623	he	3546	" and she closed her eyes and shuddered , as the horrid scene of blood and death flashed before her . "
46684	46723	46623	46623	he	3546	" inquired Mrs. Hamilton , soothingly , after doubting whether or not it would be better for Ellen to pursue such an evidently painful theme , and no longer requiring an explanation of her emotion the previous Sabbath . "
46850	46851	46838	46838	his	1113	" "
46878	46879	46894	46894	they	1145	" "
46955	49403	49404	49404	Robert	102	" And she looked up in her aunt 's face with such a countenance of beseeching entreaty , that Mrs. Hamilton 's eyes filled with tears , and it was a full minute before she could speak ; but when she did , Ellen felt more relieved and comforted , than on the subject of her father 's death she had ever felt before . From her mother not being able to bear the subject even partially alluded to , and from having no one to whom she could speak of it , it had taken a still stronger hold of her imagination ; and whenever she was unusually weak , and her head aching and confused , it became still more vivid . The very visible sympathy and interest of her aunt , and the gentle words in which she tried to turn the child 's thoughts from that scene of horror to the happiness of her father in Heaven , and an assurance that , if she tried to do her duty , and to love and serve God , and trust in His mercy to render her efforts acceptable , she would rejoin him , seemed to remove the mass of tangled thought within her young mind . Her head , indeed , still ached very painfully , and her eyes seemed as if they would close , notwithstanding all her efforts to keep them open ; but when she awoke from a long quiet sleep , on the sofa in Mrs. Hamilton 's dressing - room , where her aunt had laid her , and found that kind friend still watching over her , the little heart and temples had ceased to throb so quickly , and she felt better and happier . Mr. Maitland , the medical friend of the family , confirmed the opinion which Edward had said their physician in India had given of his sister 's state of health . He did not , he said , consider her liable to serious illness , or of a constitution that would not endure ; but that he feared it would be some years before she knew the blessing of really good health , and be constantly subject to that lassitude , severe headache , and the depression of the whole system thence proceeding , which must prevent the liveliness and quickness of acquirement natural to most children . He thought the evil had been very greatly increased by want of sufficient care in early years , and the unwholesome climate in which she had so long lived , that he wondered her mother had not been advised to send her over to England , adding , with a smile , he was quite sure Mrs. Hamilton would not have refused the charge , anxious as it might have been . And earnestly , not only on account of the child 's physical but mental health , did Mrs. Hamilton wish that such had been the case , and that she had had the care of her niece from earliest infancy ; and how much more would she have wished this , had she known that Mrs. Fortescue had really been advised to do with Ellen as Mr. Maitland had said , but that believing it merely an idle fancy , and persisting , too , in her own headstrong idea , that it was ill - temper , not illness , which rendered Ellen so disagreeable , she would not stoop so to conquer her unfortunate pride as to ask such a favor of her relatives , and to whom else could she appeal ? Colonel Fortescue had none but distant cousins . She did satisfy a qualm of conscience by once suggesting to her husband — as her own idea , however , not as that of an experienced physician — that as he fancied Ellen was always ill , she might be better in England ; but , as she expected , not only his intense love for his little girl rose up against the idea of separation , but his pride revolted from sending her to claim the pity of relatives who had so completely cast off her parents : yet had he been told it was absolutely necessary for her health and so greatly for her happiness , he would not have hesitated to sacrifice every thought of self . But Eleanor , satisfied that she had done her duty , and delighted that in one respect he was quite as proud as she was , never again referred to the subject , and the physician who had thus advised , from his constant removals , he never chanced to meet . Great , indeed , was the amount of childish suffering which this selfish decision , on the part of her mother , occasioned Ellen . We do not mean the pain of constant languor itself , though that in its full amount our happy healthful young readers can not have the least idea of : they , perhaps , think it almost a pleasant change , the care , and petting , and presents so often lavished on a brief decided illness : but that is a very different thing to that kind of suffering which only so affects them as to be dull and heavy , they do not know why , and to make it such a very difficult task to learn the lessons others find so easy ; and such a pain sometimes to move , that they are thought slow and unwilling , and perhaps even idle , when they would gladly run , and help , and work as others ; and so weak sometimes , that tears start at the first harsh or unkind word , and they are thought cross , when they do not in the least feel so ; and this , not for a few weeks , but , with few exceptions , the trial of months and even years . And this was Ellen's — which not even the tenderest and most unfailing care of her aunt could entirely guard her from . It is a most difficult thing for those who are strong and healthy themselves to understand and always bear with physical suffering in others . Miss Harcourt , though in general free from any thing like prejudice , and ardently desirous to follow up her own and Mrs. Hamilton 's ideas of right and wrong , could not so govern her affections as to feel the same toward Ellen as she did toward Edward and the children she had lived with and taught so long . Her task with Ellen required more patience and forbearance and care than with either of the others , and sometimes she could not help believing and acting toward her as if it were willful idleness and carelessness , not the languor of disease . With the recollection and evidence of Herbert , who had been delicate from his birth , and who was yet of such a remarkably gifted mind , and so bright in aspect , so sweet in temper , that illness seemed to have spiritualized instead of deadened every faculty , she could not understand , as Mrs. Hamilton did , the force of circumstances in producing from nearly the same cause two much different effects , nor how it was that complete neglect had engendered more evils than indiscreet indulgence ; but that it appeared to have done so , was unhappily only too evident not only to Miss Harcourt but to Mrs. Hamilton . It seemed almost surprising , and certainly a proof of a remarkably good disposition , that Edward appeared so free from great faults , and of such a warm , generous , frank , and seemingly unselfish nature , so open to conviction and to all good impressions , that , except occasional fits of violent passion , there really was , as far as his aunt and uncle could perceive , nothing to complain of . They did not know that he stood in such awe of Mr. Hamilton , from his mother 's lessons of his exceeding sternness , that he exercised the greatest control over himself ; and he was so excessively fond of Mr. Howard , and his days glided by in such varied and delightful employment , that there was no temptation to do wrong , except certain acts of trifling disobedience , of more consequence from the self - will they betrayed than the acts themselves , but which might have been sources of anxiety to his aunt , and lessened her confidence in him had she known them ; but she did not , for Ellen not only constantly concealed , but she was the sufferer for him , and so brought reproof and suspicion on herself , which , could the truth have been known , might have been averted . But truth of act as well as word had never been impressed on Edward ; and , therefore , though he was constitutionally too brave to utter a falsehood , too honorable to shield himself at the expense of another , if he knew that other suffered , he had been too long taught to believe that Ellen was his inferior , and must always give up to him , to imagine that he was even acting deceitfully or unmanfully in permitting her to conceal his acts of disobedience . There was so much to love and admire in Edward , that neither Mr. nor Mrs. Hamilton imagined the real weakness of his character — that those lovable qualities all sprung from natural impulse , unsustained by any thing like principle . The quickness and apparent fervor with which he received the religious impressions they and Mr. Howard sought so earnestly to instill in the short time that was allowed them before he entered the navy , they augured so hopefully from , that not only his preceptor and uncle , but his ever anxious aunt , looked forward to his career with scarcely a doubt as to its probity and honor . Ellen caused her infinitely more anxiety . There was a disregard to truth , a want of openness and candor , which , though Mrs. Hamilton believed the effects of neglect and extreme timidity , both her husband and Miss Harcourt feared were natural . Much , indeed , sprung from the poor child 's mistaken idea of the nature and solemnity of the promise she had made her mother , and her constant watchfulness and determination to shield Edward . For the disregard to truth , her mother had , indeed , alone been answerable . Ellen 's naturally very timid character required the inculcation of a high , firm principle , to enable her so to conquer herself as to speak the truth , even if she suffered from it . It was only , indeed , in extreme cases of fear — and never to her father that she had ever spoken falsely ; but to Mrs. Hamilton 's high principles , which by extreme diligence and care she had so successfully imparted to her own children , even concealment was often an acted untruth , and of this fault and equivocation Ellen was but too often guilty ; exciting Miss Harcourt 's and Caroline 's prejudices yet more against her . The latter , with all her faults , never swerved from the rigid truth , and had a strong contempt and dislike toward all those who did — except her friend Annie , who , as she always took care to speak the truth to her , she did not suspect of being less careful than herself . Emmeline , who had had some difficulty in restraining her love of exaggeration , and also in so conquering her own timidity and fear as always to speak the truth , only pitied Ellen , but did not love her the less . Of course , it was not till some months had passed that these lights and shadows of character in the orphans , and in the opinions they culled forth in those around them , could be discovered ; but notwithstanding she stood almost alone in her opinion , notwithstanding there was very little outward evidence that she was correct , Mrs. Hamilton believed there was a great deal more in her niece than was discernible . She seemed to possess a strength , almost an intensity , of feeling and warmth of affection , which , if properly guided , would effectually aid in removing the childish errors engendered by neglect ; and it was this belief which not only enabled her to bear calmly the anxiety and care , and often pain , which those faults and their compelled correction occasioned , but actually to love her niece , if possible , still more than Edward , and very nearly with the same amount of quiet but intense affection which she felt for her own children . One very fine morning in May , Mrs. Hamilton invited Edward to join her in a walk , intending also to call at Moorlands and Greville Manor on their way . The lads were released for a few days from their attendance on Mr. Howard , that gentleman having been summoned on some clerical business to Exeter . Percy was to accompany his father on an equestrian excursion ; Herbert had been commissioned by Emmeline some days before to take some books to Mary Greville , and had looked forward himself to spending a morning with her . Edward , delighted at being selected as his aunt 's companion , prepared with haste and glee for his excursion . Robert was , however , unfortunately not at hand to give him a clean pair of shoes ( he had already spoiled two pair that morning by going into the stream which ran through the park to sail a newly - rigged frigate ) , and angry at the delay , fearing that his aunt would not wait for him , he worked himself into such a violent passion , that when Robert did appear he gave vent to more abusive language than he had ever yet ventured to use , concluding by hurling both his discarded shoes at the domestic , who only escaped a severe blow by starting aside , and permitting them to go through the window . "
49431	49457	49424	49424	he	156	" was Mrs. Hamilton 's most unexpected interference , and Edward so started at her voice and look , that his passion was suddenly calmed . "
49492	49576	49577	49577	You	0	" And never did Edward leave her presence more gladly . Shame had suddenly conquered anger ; and though his chest still heaved and his cheeks were still flushed , he did not utter another word till nearly a quarter of a mile on their walk . Twice he had looked up in his aunt 's face as if about to speak , but the expression was so very grave , that he felt strangely afraid to proceed . At length he exclaimed — "
49595	49596	49597	49597	I	0	" "
49629	49630	49626	49627	Your uncle	3427	" "
49639	49643	49626	49627	Your uncle	3427	" implored Edward , "
49657	49658	49645	49645	I	0	" "
49732	49736	49725	49725	you	76	" Edward unhesitatingly answered "
49739	49740	49725	49725	you	76	" "
49745	49746	49725	49725	you	76	" "
49771	49772	49750	49750	he	3427	" "
49810	49814	49807	49807	he	3427	" Edward hesitated . "
49845	49846	49849	49849	he	3427	" "
49883	49921	49922	49922	He	3427	" The color rose to Edward 's temples , but he set his teeth and clenched his hand , to prevent any farther display of anger ; and his aunt , after attentively observing him , continued — "
49960	49961	49954	49954	he	3427	" "
49971	49990	49991	49991	I	0	" asked Edward , in a low voice , as if still afraid his passion would regain ascendency . "
50028	50029	50024	50024	you	76	" "
50039	50053	50030	50030	I	0	" replied Edward , passionately , and quite forgetting his wished for control . "
50066	50067	50054	50055	Neither equal	1160	" "
50096	50107	50108	50108	I	0	" Edward stood for a minute quite still and silent . "
50117	50124	50108	50108	I	0	" he said , at length ; "
50145	50146	50136	50136	I	0	" "
50157	50158	50159	50159	He	102	" "
50174	50175	50165	50165	I	0	" "
50211	50237	50238	50238	I	0	" Edward was again silent , and his aunt continued to talk to him so kindly yet so earnestly , that at length he exclaimed — "
50269	50270	50272	50272	you	76	" "
50292	50293	50280	50280	you	76	" "
50302	50308	50296	50296	I	0	" replied Edward , earnestly ; "
50329	50330	50331	50331	I	0	" "
50441	50442	50443	50443	I	0	" "
50456	50462	50443	50443	I	0	" returned Edward , sorrowfully ; "
50486	50487	50488	50488	You	76	" "
50538	50544	50526	50526	I	0	" Edward looked up surprised . "
50559	50560	50552	50552	I	0	" "
50563	50570	50552	50552	I	0	" replied Edward , blushing deeply . "
50711	50817	50709	50709	man	1176	" Edward did not make any reply , but his countenance expressed such earnest thought and softened feeling , that Mrs. Hamilton determined on not interrupting it by calling at Moorlands as she had intended , and so turned in the direction of Greville Manor . They walked on for some little time in silence , gradually ascending one of those steep and narrow but green and flowery lanes peculiar to Devonshire ; and on reaching the summit of the hill , and pausing a moment by the little gate that opened on a rich meadow , through which their path lay , an exclamation of "
50821	51144	50709	50709	man	1176	" burst from Edward . Fields of alternate red and green sloped down to the river 's edge , the green bearing the glistening color peculiar to May , the red from the full rich soil betraying that the plow had but lately been there , and both contrasting beautifully with the limpid waters , whose deep azure seemed to mock the very heavens . The Dart from that point seemed no longer a meandering river : it was so encompassed by thick woods and fertile hills that it resembled a lake , to which there was neither outlet nor inlet , save from the land . The trees all presented that exquisite variety of green peculiar to May , and so lofty was the slope on which they grew , that some seemed to touch the very sky , while others bent gracefully over the water , which their thick branches nearly touched . The hills themselves presented a complete mosaic of red and green ; the fields divided by high hedges , from which the oak and elm and beech and ash would start up , of growth so superb as to have the semblance of a cultivated park , not of natural woodland . Greville Manor , an Elizabethan building , stood on their right , surrounded by its ancient woods , which , though lovely still , Mr. Greville 's excesses had already shorn off some of their finest timber . Some parts of the river were in complete shade from the overhanging branches , while beyond them would stretch the bright blue of heaven : in other parts , a stray sunbeam would dart through an opening in the thick branches , and shine like a bright spot in the surrounding darkness ; and farther on , the cloudless sun so flung down his full refulgence , that the moving waters flashed and sparkled like burning gems . "
51179	51180	51174	51174	you	3449	" "
51186	51192	51174	51174	you	3449	" she replied , smiling ; "
51314	51315	51327	51328	dear aunt	3449	" "
51330	51342	51327	51328	dear aunt	3449	" said Edward , looking with surprised inquiry in her face . "
51542	51738	51739	51739	Herbert	102	" There was so much in this reply to surprise Edward , it seemed so to fill his mind with new ideas , that he continued his walk in absolute silence . That his aunt could ever fail , as she seemed to say she had and did , and even still at times found it difficult to do right , was very strange ; but yet somehow it seemed to comfort him , and to inspire him with a sort of courage to emulate her , and conquer his difficulties . He had fancied that she could not possibly understand how difficult it was for him always to be good ; but when he found that she could do so even from her own experience , her words appeared endowed with double force , and he loved her , and looked up to her more than ever . Ten minutes more brought them to the Gothic lodge of the Manor , and instead of seeking the front entrance , Mrs. Hamilton led the way to the flower - garden , on which Mrs. Greville 's usual morning - room opened by a glass door . "
51760	51859	51751	51751	she	143	" observed Mrs. Hamilton , somewhat anxiously ; and her anxiety increased , as on nearing the half open door she saw poor Mary , her head leaning against Herbert , deluged in tears . Mrs. Greville was not there , though the books , work , and maps upon the table told of their morning 's employment having been the same as usual . Herbert was earnestly endeavoring to speak comfort , but evidently without success ; and Mary was in general so controlled , that her present grief betrayed some very much heavier trial than usual . "
51879	52750	51867	51867	Mary	143	" she inquired , as at the first sound of her voice the poor girl sprung toward her , and tried to say how very glad she was that she had come just then ; but the words were inarticulate from sobs ; and Mrs. Hamilton , desiring Edward to amuse himself in the garden , made her sit down by her , and told her not to attempt to check her tears , but to let them have free vent a few minutes , and then to try and tell her what had occurred . It was a very sad tale for a child to tell , and as Mrs. Hamilton 's previous knowledge enabled her to gather more from it than Mary 's broken narrative permitted , we will give it in our own words . Mr. Greville had been at home for a month , a quarter of which time the good humor which some unusually successful bets had excited , lasted ; but no longer . His amusement then consisted , as usual , in trying every method to annoy and irritate his wife , and in endeavoring to make his son exactly like himself . Young as the boy was — scarcely twelve — he took him to scenes of riot and feasting , which the society of some boon companions , unhappily near neighbors , permitted ; and though Alfred 's cheek became pale , his eye haggard , and his temper uneven , his initiation was fraught with such a new species of excitement and pleasure , that it rejoiced and encouraged his father in the same measure as it agonized his mother , and , for her sake , poor Mary . That morning Alfred had declared his intention of visiting a large fair , which , with some races of but ill repute , from the bad company they collected , was to be held at a neighboring town , and told his father to prepare for a large demand on his cash , as he meant to try his hand at all the varieties of gaming which the scene presented . Mr. Greville laughed heartily at what he called the boy 's right spirit , and promised him all he required ; but there was a quivering on her mother 's lip , a deadly paleness on her cheek , that spoke volumes of suffering to the heart of the observant Mary , who sat trembling beside her . Still Mrs. Greville did not speak till her husband left the room ; but then , as Alfred was about to follow him , she caught hold of his hand , and implored him , with such a tone and look of agony , only to listen to her , for her sake to give up his intended pleasure ; that , almost frightened by an emotion which in his gentle mother he had scarcely ever seen , and suddenly remembering that he had lately been indeed most unkind and neglectful to her , he threw his arms round her neck , and promised with tears that if it gave her so much pain , he would not go ; and so sincere was his feeling at the moment that , had there been no tempter near , he would , in all probability , have kept his word . But the moment Mr. Greville heard from his son his change of intention and its cause , he so laughed at his ridiculous folly , so sneered at his want of spirit in preferring his mother 's whims to his father 's pleasures , that , as could not fail to be the case , every better feeling fled . This ought to have been enough ; but it was too good an opportunity to vent his ill - temper on his wife , to be neglected . He sought her , where she was superintending Mary 's lessons , and for nearly an hour poured upon her the most fearful abuse and cutting taunts , ending by declaring that all the good she had done by her saintly eloquence was to banish her son from her presence , whenever he left home , as in future Alfred should be his companion ; and that he should begin that very day . Mrs. Greville neither moved nor spoke in reply ; and the expression of her countenance was so sternly calm , that poor Mary felt as if she dared not give way to the emotion with which her heart was bursting . Mr. Greville left the room , and they heard him peremptorily desire the housekeeper to put up some of Master Alfred 's clothes . In a perfectly composed voice Mrs. Greville desired Mary to proceed with the exercise she was writing , and emulating her firmness , she tried to obey . Fortunately her task was writing , for to have spoken or read aloud would , she felt , have been impossible . So full half an hour passed , and then hasty footsteps were heard in the hall , and the joyous voice of Alfred exclaiming — "
52763	52764	52761	52761	papa	3546	" "
52773	52778	52761	52761	papa	3546	" was the reply . "
52799	53044	53050	53050	I	0	" The rapid tread of horses ' hoofs speedily followed the sullen clang with which the hall - door closed , and as rapidly faded away in the distance . With an irresistible impulse , Mary raised her eyes to her mother 's face ; a bright red flush had risen to her temples , but her lips were perfectly colorless , and her hand tightly pressed her heart ; but this only lasted a minute , for the next she had fallen quite senseless on the floor . Her poor child hung over her almost paralyzed with terror , and so long did the faint last , that she was conveyed to her own room , partially undressed , and laid on her bed before she at all recovered . A brief while she had clasped Mary to her bosom , as if in her was indeed her only earthly comfort , and then in a faint voice desired to be left quite alone . Mary had flung herself on the neck of the sympathizing Herbert Hamilton ( who had arrived just in the confusion attendant on Mrs. Greville 's unusual illness ) , and wept there in all the uncontrolled violence of early sorrow . Mrs. Hamilton remained some time with her afflicted friend , for so truly could she sympathize with her , that her society brought with it the only solace Mrs. Greville was capable of realizing from human companionship . "
53053	53070	53050	53050	I	0	" were the only words that in that painful interview might have even seemed like complaint ; "
53106	53561	53095	53095	Emmeline	78	" And difficult indeed did it seem to realize the cause of such a terrible dispensation ; but happily for Mrs. Greville , she could still look up in love and trust , even when below all of comfort as of joy seemed departed ; and in a few days she was enabled to resume her usual avocations , and , by an assumption of cheerfulness and constant employment , to restore some degree of peace and happiness to her child . Neither Herbert nor Edward seemed inclined to converse on their walk home , and Mrs. Hamilton was so engrossed in thought for Mrs. Greville , that she did not feel disposed to speak either . Herbert was contrasting his father with Mary 's , and with such a vivid sense of his own happier lot , that he felt almost oppressed with the thought , he was not , he never could be , grateful enough ; for , what had he done to be so much more blessed ? And when Mr. Hamilton , who , wondering at their long absence , had come out to meet them , put his arm affectionately round him , and asked him what could possibly make him look so pale and pensive , the boy 's excited feelings completely overpowered him . He buried his face on his father 's shoulder , and burst into tears ; and then leaving his mother to explain it , for he felt quite sure she could , without his telling her , darted away and never stopped till he found himself in the sanctuary of his own room ; and there he remained , trying to calm himself by earnest thought and almost unconscious prayer , till the dinner - bell summoned him to rejoin his family , which he did , quiet and gentle , but cheerful , as usual . Edward did not forget the thoughts of the morning , but the struggles so to subdue his pride as to apologize to Robert , seemed very much more difficult when he was no longer hearing his aunt 's earnest words ; but he did conquer himself , and the fond approving look , with which he was rewarded , gave him such a glowing feeling of pleasure , as almost to lessen the pain of his humiliation . A few days after the events of the last chapter , Mrs. Hamilton , accompanied by Percy , called at Moorlands . Cecil Grahame was playing in the garden , and Percy remained with him , his good - nature often making him a companion , though there was nearly six years ' difference in their age . "

53752	53758	53738	53738	Percy	150	" he added , laughing , "

53802	53809	53797	53798	Mr. Grahame	148	" inquired Percy , almost sternly . "

53973	53978	53971	53971	Cecil	159	" replied young Hamilton ; "
54002	54003	54017	54018	Your papa	1203	" "
54043	54044	54046	54046	papa	3546	" "

54391	56178	56179	56179	I	0	" replied Percy , laughing heartily at his young companion 's grotesque attempts at self - consequence , by placing his cap dandily on his head , flourishing his cane , and trying to make himself look taller . Cecil took his laugh , however , in good part , and they continued in amicable conversation till Mrs. Hamilton summoned Percy to attend her home . Our readers have , perhaps , discovered that Percy , this day was not quite as lively as usual . If they have not his mother did ; for , strange to say , he walked by her side silent and dispirited . His thoughtlessness very often led him into error and its disagreeable consequences ; and , fearing this had again been the case , she playfully inquired the cause of his most unusual abstraction . He colored , but evaded the question , and successfully roused himself to talk . His mother was not anxious , for she had such perfect confidence in him , that she know if he had committed error , he would redeem it , and that his own good feelings and high principles would prevent its recurrence . It so happened , however , that young Hamilton , by a series of rather imprudent actions , had plunged himself into such a very unusual and disagreeable position , as not very well to know how to extricate himself from it , without a full confession to his father ; which , daringly brave as in general he was , he felt almost as if he really had not the courage to make . One of Mr. Hamilton 's most imperative commands was , that his sons should never incur a debt , and , to prevent the temptation , their monthly allowance was an ample one , and fully permitted any recreative indulgences they might desire . Now Percy was rather inclined to extravagance , from thoughtlessness and a profuse generosity , which had often caused him such annoyance as to make him resolve again and again to follow his father 's advice , and keep some accounts of his expenditure , as a slight check on himself . The admiration for beauty in the fine arts , which his mother had so sedulously cultivated , had had only one bad effect ; and that was that his passion for prints and paintings , and illustrated and richly - bound volumes , sometimes carried him beyond bounds , and very often occasioned regret , that he had not examined the letter - press of such works , as well as their engravings and bindings . He had given orders to Mr. Harris , a large fancy stationer , librarian , and publisher of T — , to procure for him a set of engravings , whose very interesting subjects and beautiful workmanship , Mr. Grahame had so vividly described to him , that young Hamilton felt to do without them till his father or he himself should visit the metropolis , and so judge of their worth themselves , was quite impossible . The order was given without the least regard to price . They arrived at the end of the month , and the young gentleman , to his extreme astonishment , discovered that his month 's allowance had been so expended , as not to leave him a half - quarter of the necessary sum . What to do he did not very well know . Mr. Harris had had great difficulty in procuring the prints , and of course he was bound in honor to take them . If he waited till he could pay for them , he must sacrifice the whole of one month 's allowance , and then how could he keep free from debt till the next ? As for applying to his father , he shrank from it with actual pain . How could he ask his ever kind and indulgent parent to discharge a debt incurred by such a thoughtless act of unnecessary extravagance ? Mr. Harris made very light of it , declaring that , if Mr. Percy did not pay him for a twelvemonth , it was of no consequence ; he would trust him for any sum or any time he liked . But to make no attempt to liquidate his debt was as impossible as to speak to his father . No , after a violent struggle with his pride , which did not at all like the idea of betraying his inability to pay the whole , or of asking a favor of Mr. Harris , he agreed to pay his debt by installments , and so in two or three months , at the very latest , discharge the whole . One week afterward he received his month 's allowance , and riding over directly to the town relieved his conscience of half its load . To have only half his usual sum , however , for monthly expenditure caused him so many checks and annoyances as to make him hate the very sight of the prints whose possession he had so coveted , but he looked forward to the next month to be free at least of Mr. Harris . The idea of disobedience to his father in incurring a debt at all , causing him more annoyance than all the rest . Again the first day of the month came round , and putting the full sum required in his purse , he set off , but on his way encountered such a scene of distress , that every thought fled from his mind , except how to relieve it . He accompanied the miserable half - famished man to a hut in which lay a seemingly dying woman with a new - born babe , and two or three small half - starved , half - naked children — listened to their story , which was really one of truth and misfortune , not of whining deceit , poured the whole contents of his purse into their laps , and rode off to T — , to find not Mr. Harris but Mr. Maitland , and implore him to see what his skill would do for the poor woman . He encountered that gentleman at the outskirts of the town , told his story , and was so delighted at Mr. Maitland 's willing promise to go directly , and also to report the case to those who would relieve it , that he never thought of any thing else till he found himself directly opposite Mr. Harris 's shop , and his bounding heart sunk suddenly down , as impelled by a weight of lead . The conviction flashed upon him that he had been giving away money which was actually not his own ; and the deed which had been productive of so much internal happiness , now seemed to reproach and condemn him . He rode back without even seeking Mr. Harris , for what could he tell him as the reason of his non - payment ? Certainly not his having given it away . The first of May , which was his birthday , he had been long engaged to spend with some young men and lads who were to have a grand game of cricket , a jovial dinner , an adjournment to some evening amusement , and , to conclude the day , a gay supper , with glees and songs . Mr. Hamilton had rather wished Percy to leave the party after dinner , and had told him so , merely , however , as a preference , not a command , but giving him permission to use his own discretion . Percy knew there would be several expenses attendant on the day , but still he had promised so long to be one of the party , which all had declared would be nothing without him , and his own inclinations so urged him to join it , that it seemed to him utterly impossible to draw back , especially as he could give no excuse for doing so . How could he say that he could not afford it ? when he was , or ought to have been , nearly the richest of the party ; and what would his father think ? He went . The day was thoroughly delightful , and so exciting , that though he had started from home with the intention of leaving them after dinner , he could not resist the pleadings of his companions and his own wishes , and remained . At supper alone excitement and revelry seemed to have gained the upper hand , and Percy , though steady in entirely abstaining from all excess , was not quite so guarded as usual . A clergyman had lately appeared at T — , whose appearance , manners , and opinions had given more than usual food for gossip , and much uncharitableness . His cloth indeed ought to have protected him , but it rather increased the satire , sarcasm , and laughter which he excited . He was brought forward by the thoughtless youths of Percy 's party , quizzed unmercifully , made the object of some clever caricatures and satires , and though young Hamilton at first kept aloof , he could not resist the contagion . He dashed off about half - a - dozen verses of such remarkably witty and clever point , that they were received with roars of applause , and an unanimous request for distribution ; but this he positively refused , and put them up with one or two other poems of more innocent wit , in which he was fond of indulging , into his pocket . The day closed , and the next morning brought with it so many regrets , and such a confused recollection of the very unusual excitement of the previous evening , that he was glad to dismiss the subject from his mind , and threw his satire , as he believed , into the fire . In fact , he was so absorbed with the disagreeable conviction that he could only pay Mr. Harris a third of his remaining debt , trifling as in reality it was , that he thought of nothing else . Now Mr. Harris was the editor and publisher of rather a clever weekly paper , and Percy happened to be in his parlor waiting to speak to him , while he was paying a contribution . "
56197	56211	56181	56181	my	0	" he said , half laughing , as the gentleman left them together . "
56232	56239	56226	56226	you	1219	" was Mr. Harris 's reply . "
56285	56286	56271	56271	you	1219	" "
56342	56343	56332	56332	your	1219	" "
56352	56359	56362	56362	me	0	" replied Mr. Harris , smiling . "
56395	57253	56388	56388	I	0	" replied Percy , with almost his natural gayety , for he felt he wrote better verses than those Mr. Harris had been so liberally paying for ; and the idea of feeling free again was so very delightful , that , after receiving Mr. Harris 's solemn promise not to betray his authorship , he galloped home , more happy than he had been for some days . Mr. Harris had said he must have them that evening , and Robert was leaving for the town , as his young master entered the house . He hastily put up his portfolio , and sent it off . His conscience was so perfectly free from keeping any thing that he afterward had cause to regret , that he did not think of looking them over , and great was his delight , when a few lines arrived from Mr. Harris , speaking in the highest terms of his talent , and saying , that the set of verses he had selected , even without the attraction of his name , would entirely liquidate his trifling debt . For the next few days Percy trod on air . He had resolved on waiting till the poem appeared , and then , as he really had discharged his debt , take courage and confess the whole to his father , for his idea of truth made him shrink from any farther concealment . He hoped and believed that his father would regard the pain and constant annoyance he had been enduring so long , as sufficient penalty for his disobedience , and after a time give him back the confidence , which he feared must at his first confession be withdrawn . What , then , was his grief , his vexation , almost his despair , when he recognized in the poem selected , the verses he thought and believed he had burned the morning after they were written ; and which in print , and read by his sober self , seemed such a heartless , glaring , cruel insult , not only on a fellow - creature , but a minister of God , that he felt almost overwhelmed . What could he do ? Mr. Harris was not to blame , for he had made no reservation as to the contents of his portfolio . His name , indeed , was not to them , and only having been read lightly once to his companions of that hateful supper — for so he now felt it — almost all of whom were not perfectly sober , there was a chance of their never being recognized as his , and as their subject did not live near any town where the paper was likely to circulate , might never meet his eye . But all this was poor comfort . The paper was very seldom seen at Oakwood , but its contents were often spoken of before his parents , and how could he endure a reference to those verses , how bear this accumulation of concealment , and , as he felt , deceit , and all sprung from the one thoughtless act of ordering an expensive and unnecessary indulgence , without sufficient consideration how it was to be paid . To tell his father , avow himself the author of such a satire , and on such a subject , he could not . Could he tell his mother , and implore her intercession ? that seemed like a want of confidence in his father — no — if he ever could gain courage to confess it , it should be to Mr. Hamilton alone ; but the more he thought , the more , for the first time , his courage failed . It was only the day before his visit to Lady Helen 's that he had discovered this accumulation of misfortune , and therefore it was not much wonder he was so dispirited . Two days afterward Herbert , with a blushing cheek and very timid voice , asked his father to grant him a great favor . He was almost afraid to ask it , he said , but he hoped and believed his parent would trust his assurance that it was for nothing improper . It was that he might be from home next day unattended for several hours . He should go on horseback , but he was so accustomed to ride , and his horse was so steady , he hoped he might be allowed to go alone . Mr. Hamilton looked very much surprised , as did all present . That the quiet , studious Herbert should wish to give up his favorite pursuits , so soon too after Mr. Howard 's return , and go on what appeared such a mysterious excursion , was something so extraordinary , that various expressions of surprise broke from his sisters and Edward . Percy did look up but made no observation . Mr. Hamilton only paused , however , to consult his wife 's face and then replied — "
57354	57355	57357	57357	you	0	" "
57381	57416	57370	57370	I	0	" replied Herbert , so eagerly that his cheeks flushed still deeper , and his eyes glistened ; then throwing himself on the stool at his mother 's feet , he said , pleadingly , "
57460	57461	57475	57476	my Herbert	1231	" "
57465	57472	57475	57476	my Herbert	1231	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , fondly . "
57499	57555	57484	57484	I	0	" she added , playfully laying her hand on Percy 's shoulder , and laughing at Edward , who was so excessively amused at the sage Herbert 's turning truant , that he was giving vent to a variety of most grotesque antics of surprise . Percy sighed so heavily that his mother was startled . "
57571	57575	57556	57556	I	0	" she said . "
57600	57601	57593	57593	yourself	868	" "
57619	57629	57614	57614	him	102	" exclaimed Percy , far more despondingly than usual . "
57704	57911	57698	57698	I	0	" Percy threw his arm round her waist , and kissed her two or three times , without saying a word , and when he started up and , said , in his usual gay tone , that as he was not going to turn truant the next day , he must go and finish some work , she saw tears in his eyes . That something was wrong , she felt certain , but still she trusted in his candor and integrity , and did not express her fears even to her husband . The morrow came . Percy and Edward went to Mr. Howard 's , and Herbert at half - past nine mounted his quiet horse , and after affectionately embracing his mother , and again promising care and steadiness , departed . He had risen at five this morning , and studied till breakfast so earnestly that a double portion was prepared for the next day . He had said , as he was starting , that , if he might remain out so long , he should like to call at Greville Manor on his way back , take tea there , and return home in the cool of the evening . "
57933	57938	57924	57924	I	0	" replied Mrs. Hamilton ; "
57967	58162	58165	58165	mamma	3420	" But Herbert did not expect to enjoy himself half as much as if he had gone to Mr. Howard 's as usual . He did not like to mention his real object , for it appeared as if the chances were so much against its attainment , and if it were fulfilled , to speak about it would be equally painful , from its having been an act of kindness . The day passed quietly , and a full hour before prayers , Herbert was seen riding through the grounds , and when he entered the usual sitting - room , he looked so happy , so animated that , if his parents had felt any anxiety — which they had not — it would have vanished at once . But though they were contented not to ask him any questions , the young party were not , and , except by Percy ( who seemed intently engaged with a drawing ) , he was attacked on all sides , and , to add to their mirth , Mr. Hamilton took the part of the curious , his wife that of her son . "
58173	58180	58165	58165	mamma	3420	" exclaimed the little joyous Emmeline ; "
58198	58199	58190	58190	Herbert	102	" "
58205	58207	58190	58190	Herbert	102	" and "
58216	58305	58214	58214	mamma	3420	" was the reply from both at the same moment , but the denial was useless ; and the prayer - bell rung , before any satisfaction for the curious could be obtained , except that from half - past six Herbert had been very quietly at Mrs. Greville 's . That night , as Percy sat in gloomy meditation in his own room , before he retired to bed , he felt a hand laid gently on his shoulder , and looking up , beheld his brother — "
58316	58325	58307	58307	you	102	" asked Herbert , with almost melancholy reproach . "
58369	58370	58350	58350	You	102	" "
58447	58448	58440	58440	I	0	" "
58465	58485	58463	58463	Percy	99	" pleaded Herbert , twining his arm round his neck , and looking with affectionate confidence in his face . "
58619	58620	58623	58623	myself	0	" "
58627	58855	58623	58623	myself	0	" replied Percy , so strangely cheered , that he almost laughed at Herbert 's very novel idea , and after listening with earnest interest to his story , took courage and told his own . Herbert in this instance , however , could not comfort him as successfully as usual . The satire was the terrible thing ; every thing else but that , even the disobedience of the debt , he thought might be easily remedied by an open confession to his father ; but that unfortunate oversight in not looking over his papers before he sent them to Mr. Harris , the seeming utter impossibility to stop their circulation , was to both these single - hearted , high - principled lads something almost overwhelming . It did not in the least signify to either that Percy might never be known as their author . Herbert could not tell him what to do , except that , if he could but get sufficient courage to tell their father , even if he could not help them , he was sure it would be a great weight off his mind , and then he gently reproached him for not coming to him to help him discharge his debt ; it was surely much better to owe a trifle to his brother than to Mr. Harris . "
58873	58879	58884	58884	Bertie	102	" replied Percy , indignantly . "
58919	58927	58915	58916	a child	265	" he added with almost comic ruefulness , "
59032	59033	59035	59035	you	1252	" "
59058	59087	59040	59042	a Mr. Morton	162	" asked Mr. Hamilton of his wife , on the Saturday morning after Herbert 's mysterious excursion . The family had not yet left the breakfast - table . "
59091	59096	59097	59099	poor young man	1253	" was the reply ; "
59118	59119	59101	59101	his	1253	" "
59125	59130	59137	59137	his	1253	" inquired Miss Harcourt ; "

59438	59506	59507	59507	He	1253	" An exclamation of horror burst from all the little group , except from Percy and Herbert ; the face of the former was covered with his hands , and his brother seemed so watching and feeling for him , as to be unable to join the general sympathy . All , however , were so engrossed with Mr. Hamilton 's tale , that neither was observed . "
59762	59763	59767	59767	you	1253	" "
59775	59779	59780	59780	you	1253	" asked Caroline ; "

59921	59922	59909	59909	I	0	" "
59934	59939	59926	59926	he	1253	" innocently asked Emmeline . "
59955	59956	59941	59941	nobody	1284	" "
60025	60026	60021	60021	she	3462	" "
60033	60040	60021	60021	she	3462	" answered Mrs. Hamilton , smiling ; "
60053	60054	60041	60041	your	1285	" "
60100	60101	60106	60106	you	1285	" "
60124	60125	60126	60126	I	0	" "
60213	60214	60198	60198	he	1253	" "
60315	60316	60317	60317	I	0	" "
60325	60330	60317	60317	I	0	" observed Miss Harcourt ; "
60342	60343	60317	60317	I	0	" "
60474	60475	60454	60454	I	0	" "
60493	60544	60481	60485	the person who wrote it	1299	" interposed Caroline , to Edward 's and Ellen 's astonishment , that she had courage to speak at all ; for their uncle 's unusual tone and look brought back almost more vividly than it had ever done before their mother 's lessons of his exceeding and terrible sternness . "
60613	60614	60621	60622	the writer	1295	" "
60677	60678	60679	60679	Mother	3430	" "
60698	60959	60692	60692	you	3430	" at length exclaimed poor Percy , so choked with his emotion , that he could only throw himself by her side , bury his face in her lap , and sob for a few minutes like a child . But he recovered himself with a strong effort , before either of his family could conquer their anxiety and alarm , and , standing erect , though pale as marble , without in the least degree attempting excuse or extenuation , acknowledged the poem as his , and poured out his whole story , with the sole exception of how he had disposed of the money , with which the second time of receiving his allowance he had intended to discharge his debt ; and the manner in which he told that part of his tale , from the fear that it would seem like an excuse or a boast , was certainly more calculated to call for doubt than belief . Herbert was about to speak , but an imploring glance from Percy checked him . Mr. Hamilton was silent several minutes after his son had concluded , before he could reply . Percy was so evidently distressed — had suffered so much from the consequence of his own errors — felt so intensely the unintentional publication of his poem — for his father knew his truth far too well to doubt his tale , and there was something so intrinsically noble in his brave confession , that to condemn him severely he felt as if he could not . "
60974	60984	60967	60967	your	162	" he said , as sternly as he could ; "
61170	61345	61346	61346	You	1313	" Mr. Hamilton rose with the last words , and somewhat hastily quitted the room . Percy only ventured one look at his mother , she seemed so grieved — so sad — that he could not bear it ; and darting out of the room , was seen in less than a minute traversing the grounds in the direction of the vicarage , at such a rate that Edward , fleet as in general he was , could not overtake him . Herbert lingered ; he could not bear that any part of Percy 's story should remain concealed , and so told at once how his second allowance had been expended . Mrs. Hamilton 's eyes glistened . Percy 's incoherence on that one point had given her more anxiety than any thing else , and the relief the truth bestowed was inexpressible . Imprudent it was ; but there was something so lovable in such a disposition , that she could not resist going directly to her husband to impart it . "
61354	61360	61346	61346	You	1313	" was his fond rejoinder ; "
61448	61449	61451	61451	me	0	" "
61472	61473	61476	61476	he	1315	" "
61485	61585	61476	61476	he	1315	" Mrs. Hamilton looked very thoughtful , but she did not make any rejoinder . In the hour of recreation Emmeline , declaring it was much too hot for the garden , sought her mother 's private sitting - room , with the intention of asking where she could find her father . To her great delight , the question was arrested on her lips , for he was there . She seated herself on his knee , and remained there for some minutes without speaking — only looking up in his face with the most coaxing expression imaginable . "
61600	61607	61594	61594	you	78	" said Mr. Hamilton , smiling ; "
61617	61618	61621	61621	papa	3546	" "
61630	61631	61626	61626	you	3546	" "

61660	61683	61686	61686	they	1320	" she replied , laughing , and shaking her head till her long bright ringlets completely hid her eyes and blushing cheeks . "
61697	61698	61686	61686	they	1320	" "
61701	61711	61712	61712	they	1320	" replied her father , joining in her laugh ; "
61719	61720	61712	61712	they	1320	" "
61729	61734	61726	61726	I	0	" said Mrs. Hamilton ; "
61753	61754	61747	61747	Emmeline	78	" "
61760	61776	61747	61747	Emmeline	78	" still she hesitated , as if afraid to continue , and her mother added — "
61801	61831	61787	61787	Emmeline	78	" A still deeper glow mounted to the child 's fair cheek , and throwing her arms round her father 's neck , she said , coaxingly and fondly — "
61923	61924	61925	61925	I	0	" "
61947	61960	61940	61940	Emmeline	78	" said Mr. Hamilton , caressingly stroking the ringlets she had disordered , "
61978	61979	61940	61940	Emmeline	78	" "
61994	62023	61982	61982	you	845	" exclaimed Emmeline , almost suffocating him with kisses , and then starting from his knee , she danced about the room in a perfect ecstasy of delight ; "
62053	62054	62039	62039	Mamma	80	" "
62092	62108	62084	62084	you	78	" In an instant she was on his knee again , quite quiet and attentive . "
62141	62142	62145	62145	papa	3546	" "
62269	62270	62260	62261	dear papa	845	" "
62293	62298	62281	62281	you	3546	" Emmeline was silent . "
62342	62343	62331	62331	he	99	" "
62383	62384	62371	62371	he	99	" "
62396	62397	62371	62371	he	99	" "

62440	62441	62442	62442	He	99	" "
62456	62472	62442	62442	He	99	" replied her father , drawing her closer to him , with almost involuntary tenderness . "
62661	62662	62659	62659	you	0	" "
62721	62722	62688	62688	God	85	" "
62831	62832	62824	62824	you	1356	" "
62874	62875	62859	62859	He	85	" "
62957	62958	62944	62944	mamma	3420	" "
62985	62986	62961	62961	mamma	3420	" "
63076	63404	63408	63409	a fool	1366	" His child made no answer in words , but she slipped from his knee , and darting to her mother , clasped her little arms tight round her neck , and hid her glowing cheeks and tearful eyes in her bosom . And from that hour , as she felt her mother 's fond return of that passionate embrace , her love became religion , though she knew it not . Her thoughts flew to her cousins and many others , who had no mother , and to others whose mothers left them to nurses and governesses , and seemed always to keep them at a distance . And she felt , How could she thank and love God enough ? Nor was it the mere feeling of the moment , it became part of her being , for the right moment had been seized to impress it . Meanwhile the young heir of Oakwood had passed no very pleasant day . His thoughts since Mr. Howard 's return had been so pre - occupied , that his studies had been unusually neglected ; so much so , as rather to excite the displeasure of his gentle and forbearing preceptor . The emotion of the morning had not tended to steady his ideas , and a severe reproof and long imposition was the consequence . Not one word did he deign to address Herbert and Edward , who , perceiving him leave the Vicarage with every mark of irritation , endeavored , during their walk home , to soothe him . His step was even more rapid than that in which he had left home , and he neither stopped nor spoke till he had reached his father 's library , which , fortunately for the indulgence of his ire in words , was untenanted . He dashed his cap from his brow , flung his books with violence on the ground , and burst forth — "
63591	63592	63593	63593	Percy	99	" "
63595	63694	63593	63593	Percy	99	" exclaimed Mrs. Hamilton , who , having sought him the moment she heard the hall - door close , had heard nearly the whole of his violent speech , and was almost alarmed at the unusual passion it evinced . Her voice of astonished expostulation checked his words , but not his agitation ; he threw himself on a chair , leaning his arms upon the table , buried his face upon them , while his whole frame shook . His mother sat down by him , and laying her hand on his arm , said gently — "
63734	63860	63861	63861	I	0	" Percy tried to keep silence , for he knew if he spoke he should , as he expressed it , be a child again , and his pride tried hard for victory . Even his father or Herbert at that moment would have chafed him into increased anger , but the almost passionate love and reverence which he felt for his mother triumphed over his wrath , and told him he was much more unhappy than angry ; and that he longed for her to comfort him , as she always had done in his childish griefs ; and so he put his arms round her , and laid his head on her shoulder and said , in a half - choked voice : — "
63920	63921	63922	63922	You	0	" "
63960	64211	63952	63952	you	0	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , as she lightly pushed back the clustering hair from his heated forehead , and the gentle touch of her cool hand seemed as restorative as her soothing words ; and Percy , as he listened to her , as she continued speaking to him in the same strain for some little time , felt more relieved than five minutes before he thought possible , and more than ever determined that he would never act so thoughtlessly ; or , if he were tempted to do so , never keep it concealed so long again . Mrs. Hamilton 's anxious desire with him was , always to do justice to his better qualities , at the same time that she blamed and convinced him of his faults . It was a very delicate thing , and very difficult to succeed in , perhaps impossible to minds less peculiarly refined , and hearts less intensely anxious than Mrs. Hamilton 's ; but no difficulty , no failure , had ever deterred her — and in Percy she was already rewarded . He was of that high , fine spirit , that any unjust harshness would have actually confirmed in error — any unguarded word bring argument on argument , and so , for the mere sake of opposition , cause him to abide in his opinions , when the acknowledgment of his being right in some things , produced the voluntary confession of his error in others . "

64523	64524	64513	64514	Mr. Morton	162	" "
64535	64544	64548	64548	mother	3430	" He looked at her in utter bewilderment . "
64550	64554	64548	64548	mother	3430	" he repeated . "
64586	64594	64581	64581	yourself	0	" Percy crimsoned to the very temples . "
64605	64611	64603	64603	mother	3430	" he answered very hurriedly ; "
64618	64619	64620	64620	You	868	" "
64724	64725	64718	64718	you	868	" "
64741	64749	64763	64763	his	162	" answered Percy , still much heated ; "
64789	64790	64784	64784	I	0	" "
64951	64970	64978	64979	Mr. Morton	162	" Percy did not reply , but his countenance denoted an inward struggle , and his mother added — "
65117	65258	65113	65113	you	868	" She left the room as she spoke , but Percy remained for some few minutes longer in deep thought , and when he prepared for dinner , and joined his family , it was still in the same unbroken silence . Mr. Hamilton took no notice of him , and two or three times the little affectionate Emmeline felt the tears rising to her eyes , for she could not bear to see that brother , who was in general the life of the family group , so silent and abstracted . Sliding after him , as he quitted the room after dinner , she took his hand , and looked coaxingly in his face , longing , but not daring to tell him her father 's promise , for fear he should discover her share in the transaction . "
65264	65265	65113	65113	you	868	" "
65280	65281	65275	65275	me	0	" "
65298	65299	65291	65291	I	0	" "
65303	65309	65291	65291	I	0	" repeated the little girl ; "
65316	65317	65291	65291	I	0	" "
65357	65619	65620	65620	You	1403	" He kissed her forehead and left her , and a few minutes afterward she was summoned to join her mother , Caroline , and Ellen , in a walk . They sauntered through the grounds in the direction of the northern lodge , which opened on the road leading to Dartmoor ; when , not a quarter of an hour after they had left the house , they were overtaken by Percy , riding at what seemed almost a hand gallop , but he had time as he passed his mother to gracefully doff his cap , and her fond heart throbbed , as she caught the expression of his flushed , but earnest face . He was out of sight in another moment , followed by Robert , who was the lads ' constant attendant . Before they had concluded their walk , they met Mrs. Greville and Mary , and returned with them to the house . Emmeline , who had not seen Mary for nearly a fortnight , was in an ecstasy of enjoyment , and Ellen always felt it a real pleasure quietly to walk by Mary 's side , and answer the many questions with which she always contrived to interest her . On entering the house , Mr. Hamilton , Herbert , and Edward joined them , and Mrs. Hamilton was somewhat surprised at the even more than ordinary warmth with which her son was greeted by her friends , and at the flush which stained his cheek at Mrs. Greville 's first words — "
65636	65653	65634	65634	Herbert	102	" she inquired , and as she looked at him , her eyes glistened in tears . "
65661	65689	65634	65634	Herbert	102	" he replied instantly , and as if he would exceedingly like to change the subject ; but Mrs. Greville , turning to Mrs. Hamilton , continued — "
65743	65744	65745	65745	I	0	" "
65759	65766	65754	65754	you	1403	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , smiling ; "
65814	65815	65802	65802	I	0	" "
65825	65845	65817	65817	you	1403	" exclaimed Mary and her mother at the same moment ; and the former continued , with unusual eagerness , "
65963	65964	65965	65965	He	102	" "
65984	65997	66002	66002	he	102	" interposed Mrs. Greville , her voice so faltering , that tears almost escaped,—"a
66114	66205	66083	66083	you	78	" When Mrs. Greville and Mary had first begun to speak , Herbert tried to retreat ; but Edward placing himself against the door , so that to open it was impossible , and Caroline and Emmeline , both at once catching hold of him , to keep him prisoner , egress was not to be thought of ; so , in laughing despair , he broke from his sisters , flung himself on his usual seat , his mother 's stool , and almost hid himself in her dress . "
66215	66220	66083	66083	you	78	" answered Mr. Hamilton ; "
66269	66270	66257	66257	you	1415	" "
66375	66403	66372	66372	you	3546	" he continued , looking up in her face with that expression of affection , which very few , even comparative strangers , had power to remit . "
66493	66590	66478	66478	Herbert	102	" The entrance of Mr. Grahame changed the current of the conversation , greatly to Herbert 's relief , for he did not at all like being thus brought forward . Austere as Grahame was at home , he was always welcomed with pleasure by the young Hamiltons , who never could understand why Annie and Cecil should so fear him . That something unusual had annoyed him , Mr. Hamilton perceived at the first glance ; but he took no notice , for Grahame seemed to find relief in talking gayly to the young people . "
66598	67097	66478	66478	Herbert	102	" he inquired , as he joined the happy group at tea , and Percy was still absent . Mr. Hamilton repeated the question in some surprise ; but his wife replying that he had gone to ride , and might not be back yet , the subject dropped . After tea , Mrs. Greville and Mary , attended by Herbert and Edward , returned to the Manor ; and the little girls went to finish some business for the next day , and amuse themselves as they liked . Grahame remained alone with his friends , who at length drew from him the cause of his solicitude . He had that morning discovered , that , notwithstanding his positive commands , Cecil had gone to the prohibited places of amusement . His wife had prevaricated when he questioned her ; at one moment almost denying her connivance at the boy 's disobedience , at another unconsciously acknowledging it , by insisting that there was no harm in it ; and if Grahame would persist in so interfering with his children 's amusements , he must expect to be disobeyed . If such were his home , where was he to look for truth , honor , and affection ? What would be his son 's after career , if such were the lessons of his childhood ? He had punished him severely , but there was little hope of its producing any good effect , when his wife was yet more to blame than his child . It would only alienate the boy 's affections still more from him . Yet what could he do ? Could he let such disobedience and untruthfulness — for Cecil had denied his having been at the races — pass unnoticed ? He had shut himself up in his library the remainder of the day ; but at length , unable to bear his own thoughts , had walked over to Oakwood , feeling sure , if peace were to be found , he should find it there . Their sympathy it was easy for Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton to give — for they felt it sincerely — but to advise was both delicate and difficult . To interfere in a household is not the part even of the most intimate friends . And when Lady Helen herself encouraged the boy in his disobedience , and showed him an example of equivocation , what could be said ? Grahame could not bear the idea of a public school for a boy scarcely eleven , and whose home - influence was so injurious , and Mr. Hamilton could not advise it . He tried , therefore , merely to raise the depressed spirits of his friend , bringing forward many instances , when even the best training failed ; and others where the faults of childhood were subdued by circumstances , and became fair promising youth . Grahame shook his head despondingly . "
67111	67115	66478	66478	Herbert	102	" he said ; "
67185	67235	67179	67179	I	0	" he added hurriedly , as he met a glance of reproach from Mrs. Hamilton , and he turned to address the two lads , who at that instant entered from their walk . The bell for prayers rung soon afterward , and Grahame rose to say good night . "
67242	67249	67179	67179	I	0	" said Mr. Hamilton , earnestly . "
67282	67512	67514	67514	you	1431	" Grahame yielded without an instant 's hesitation . Still Percy had not returned , and his mother became dreadfully anxious . Her husband , at her request , waited a quarter of an hour , but reluctantly ; for he was more particular that every member of his household should assemble at the stated hour of prayer , than in any other point relating to his establishment . Scarcely , however , had the first word been said , when Percy and Robert entered , and the former , with a very rapid , but noiseless step , traversed the large room , and kneeled in his accustomed place . In vain did Mrs. Hamilton try to keep her thoughts fixed on the service . Had he really been to Mr. Morton , and if he had , how had he been received ? had his fine spirit been soothed or irritated ? and a thousand other nameless but natural fears thronged her heart . But one look on her son as he rose reassured her ; his cheek was flushed with rapid riding , but his dark eye sparkled , and he looked more bright and joyous than he had done for weeks . He advanced without hesitation to Mr. Hamilton the moment the domestics had quitted the library and said , eagerly , but still respectfully — "
67645	67698	67639	67639	you	1435	" Astonished and touched , far more than he was ever in the habit of allowing himself to feel , much less to display , Mr. Hamilton had some difficulty in replying ; but his words were even more than satisfactory to his son 's eager heart , for he answered earnestly — "
67803	67823	67824	67824	you	1229	" he continued , as he turned with even more than his usual affection to receive her nightly embrace , "
67837	67894	67835	67835	you	1229	" If she made him happy , he certainly had returned the blessing , for Mrs. Hamilton had seldom felt more exquisite pleasure than she did at that moment ; and her little Emmeline , though she could not quite understand all her mother 's feelings , felt , in her way , almost as glad . "
67908	67933	67897	67898	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" said Mr. Grahame trying to speak cheerfully , when the young party had retired , and he was again alone with his friends . "
67944	67945	67935	67935	he	1405	" "
67985	67992	67982	67983	Mr. Grahame	148	" she added , more playfully , "
68070	68071	68075	68076	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" "
68098	68109	68089	68089	your	81	" he added , evidently resolved to change the subject , "
68142	68143	68144	68144	I	0	" "
68155	68168	68169	68170	Poor Eleanor	165	" replied Mr. Hamilton , with a fond glance toward his wife . "
68203	68204	68207	68207	her	165	" "
68211	68215	68207	68207	her	165	" observed Grahame . "
68225	68226	68227	68227	Edward	76	" "
68238	68243	68227	68227	Edward	76	" replied Mrs. Hamilton ; "
68264	68265	68267	68267	she	113	" "
68272	68273	68278	68278	him	435	" "

68299	68305	68307	68307	your	0	" answered Grahame , smiling ; "
68314	68315	68307	68307	your	0	" "
68321	68330	68307	68307	your	0	" she answered , in the same tone ; "
68362	68363	68364	68364	Grahame	148	" "
68371	68378	68379	68379	she	113	" interposed her husband , laughing ; "
68485	68674	68460	68460	She	113	" There were more than usual subjects of thought on the minds of all the young inmates of Oakwood , before they went to sleep that night . Percy 's , Herbert 's , and Emmeline 's were all peculiarly happy and peaceful . Caroline 's were not so agreeable . Praise lavished on others never gave her pleasure : the question would always come , Why did she not receive it too ? It was very hard that she so seldom received it , and self - love was always ready to accuse her parents of some degree of partiality rather than herself of unworthiness . But these thoughts only came when she was alone ; the moment she heard her father 's voice , or met her mother 's smile , they fled from her till they were pertinaciously recalled . Ellen thought mostly of Herbert . She had been as curious as the rest to know where he had been , though she had not said so much about it . But that it was for some good , kind deed she had never doubted . "
68683	68688	68677	68677	Mary	143	" she said internally ; "
68737	68750	68728	68728	he	1452	" That poor Ellen was often thought , as she expressed it , "
68752	69189	68715	68715	Herbert	102	" was true ; and it was this mingling of many apparent faults , especially disregard to her aunt 's commands , and but too often endeavor to conceal and equivocate , instead of an open confession , with a sorrow and repentance too deep and painful for her years , that so fairly bewildered Mrs. Hamilton , and really , as she had told Mr. Grahame , prevented her from understanding Ellen . If she could but have known of that unfortunate promise , and the strong hold it had taken of the child 's vivid imagination ; that by dwelling on it she had actually made herself believe that , by always shielding Edward from blame or punishment , she was obeying and making her mother love her from Heaven , and so , still more deepening her father 's affection for her ; and that this idea enabled her to bear the suffering of that most painful of all punishments , her aunt 's displeasure , Mrs. Hamilton would have left no means untried to remove such a mistaken impression , and no doubt would have succeeded ; but she had not the slightest conception of the real origin of her niece 's incomprehensible contradictions . She had believed and hoped the influences of her earlier life would disappear before the quiet , wholesome routine of the present , and often and often she found herself fearing that it could not be only maternal neglect , but actual disposition , at fault . When convinced of the great importance of truth , Ellen frequently , instead of attempting to conceal what Edward might have heedlessly done , actually took it upon herself , not being able to define that in such self - sacrifice she was also forfeiting truth ; or , if she did believe so , it was also clear , that to tell the real truth to her aunt and betray Edward , was breaking her solemn promise to her mother ; and , either way , she was doing wrong . To describe or define the chaos in the poor child 's mind , from these contending feelings , would be almost as impossible to us as it was to herself . She only knew that she was often naughty when she most wished to be good ; that her aunt must think she did not care for her displeasure ; when it made her so very unhappy , that she was scarcely ever in disgrace without being ill . That she never could feel happy , for even when "
69191	69654	68728	68728	he	1452	" there always seemed a weight hanging over her , and therefore she must be different to , and worse than any body else . Little do mere superficial observers know the capabilities for joy or suffering in a young child 's heart , the exquisitely tender germ which is committed to us ; the awful responsibility which lies in the hands of adults , for the joy or grief , good or evil , as the portion of a child ! Happily for Ellen , Mrs. Hamilton 's love was as inexhaustible as her patience , or her niece might have been still more unhappy , for few would have so understood and practiced the delicate and difficult task of constantly being called upon to correct , and yet to love . Our young readers must not think Edward very cowardly and very dishonorable , always to let his sister bear the penalty of his faults . He had never been taught , and therefore could not understand , the imperative necessity , when guilty of heedlessness or disobedience , boldly to step forward , whether others were injured or not , and avow it . He did not understand how not to say any thing about it , unless he was asked , could be a want of truth . It was also Mrs. Hamilton 's constant custom never to mention to the members of her family , who might have been absent at the time , any thing of fault or disgrace which had fallen under her own immediate jurisdiction , unless their nature absolutely demanded it ; and the absence of the young offenders from the happy family circle , either at meals or hours of recreation , when such an unusual proceeding was necessary , in consequence , never excited any remark , but a very general feeling of regret . Edward , therefore , scarcely ever heard the actual cause of his sister 's disgrace , and sometimes did not even know she had incurred it . He did , indeed , when she was sometimes absent , feel very uncomfortable ; but his immovable awe of his really indulgent uncle ( an impression of his mother 's creating , quite as strong as Ellen 's idea of the sanctity of her promise ) caused him to adopt every means of removing the uncomfortable consciousness that he was far more to blame than Ellen , but the right one , a fearless inquiry as to why she was punished , and an open avowal that it was he who had either led her into error , or was the real offender . His thoughts on Percy 's conduct were very different to those of his cousins . "
69657	69671	68728	68728	he	1452	" he exclaimed , almost aloud , in the energy of his feelings , "
69822	70810	70811	70811	I	0	" And sleep overtook him , with the firm conviction resting on his mind , that though in some things Percy might be his equal , yet in manliness and spirit , he ( Edward ) was decidedly the superior . It was the Christmas vacation — always a happy season in the halls of Oakwood . The previous year , the general juvenile party with which Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton indulged their children on the first or sixth of January , as circumstances permitted , had not taken place on account of Mrs. Fortescue 's death , and was therefore this year anticipated with even more than usual joy . Caroline and Emmeline were never permitted to go to indiscriminate parties . Two or three , really confined to children , their mother allowed their joining , with Miss Harcourt , in the course of the year , but their own ball was always considered the acme of enjoyment , especially now that Caroline began to fancy herself very much too old for only children 's parties . Annie went almost every where with Lady Helen , and quite laughed at the idea of joining children ; and Caroline this year began to wish most intensely that her mother would take her out to grown - up parties too , and lost all relish for the pleasant parties she had enjoyed . Mrs. Hamilton never obliged her to go out with Emmeline and Ellen , if she really did not wish it ; but Caroline could not get any farther in considering herself a woman . The week before Christmas , Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton did not allow to be all holiday and amusement . The season was to their feelings of religion one of earnest , intense thankfulness , and they wished to make it equally so to their children — a source of joy and hope indeed , but the joy and hope of Heaven , not the mere amusements and pleasures of earth . They had thought long and tried earnestly to make their children so to love serious things , as never to associate them with gloom or sadness — never to fancy that to be truly and spiritually religious demanded a relinquishment of the joys and pleasures and innocent happiness of their age , and admirably had they succeeded . Christmas week was always anticipated with quiet gladness , for they were still more with their father and mother ; and the few serious readings and lessons they had , were from and with them alone ; Miss Harcourt 's time was then entirely her own . As soon as Christmas - day was passed , the young party , with the sole exception of two hours ' work by themselves , in the morning or some part of the day if the mornings were wanted—(for Mrs. Hamilton never permitted all duty to be suspended , believing — and her children had experienced the wisdom of the belief — that pleasure and recreation were infinitely more enjoyable after the performance of some duty , however brief and easy , than had they nothing to do but to amuse themselves all day)—were allowed to be just as free , happy , and noisy as they pleased ; and the exuberance of their innocent happiness would have been envied by many , who might have thought the quiet routine of their usual life irksome indeed . Edward Fortescue was looking forward with the greatest delight to becoming a midshipman in the course of the following year . He hoped , indeed , it would be in a very few months ; but his uncle and Mr. Howard had only told him to work on as hard as he could , for the summons might come for him to join at a very short notice , and it would be very dreadful , if the commission should be refused because his guardians did not think him forward enough in his various studies to leave them . They had looked very mischievous when they had told him this , and Edward had enjoyed the joke , and resolved they should not have any such amusement . He would go to sea , if he worked night and day for the privilege ; and he really did so well , that his uncle gave him great praise , which was as unexpected and delightful as his anger was terrible . It happened that on the morning after Christmas - day , Edward and Ellen were quite alone in the school room ; the former was in one of his most impatient moods , for at his own request , his uncle was to examine him in a favorite study , and one of the necessary books was wanting . He had read it a few evenings previous , but something had crossed him , and in a desperate passion he had flung the book from him , and where it fell he neither knew nor cared . Caroline and Emmeline had already gone on an expedition to some poor people , with their mother ; Ellen had asked and received permission to put some seeds in her little garden , Percy having kindly promised to show her where , and to do some harder work in it for her . He was , however , still engaged with his father , and would be , he had told her , for perhaps an hour longer , but he would be sure to come to her then ; and , to employ the interval , she had intended to work hard at a purse she was making for him . Edward , however , entirely engrossed her , and for nearly half an hour they hunted in every nook and corner of the room , at length — "
70821	70835	70819	70819	Edward	166	" Ellen exclaimed , adding , however , in a very desponding tone , "
70848	70849	70842	70842	we	1459	" "
70853	70859	70819	70819	Edward	166	" answered Edward , impatiently ; "
70866	70867	70864	70864	Ellen	113	" "
70874	70916	70864	70864	Ellen	113	" she replied , pointing to one that filled a corner of the room and which , though it was winter , was filled with some beautiful flowering geraniums of all colors , and some few rare myrtles in full flower . "
70919	70924	70864	70864	Ellen	113	" said Edward joyfully ; "
70941	70942	70933	70933	I	0	" "
70955	70964	70946	70947	aunt Emmeline	78	" implored Ellen , clinging to his arm ; "
70983	70984	70974	70975	Dear Edward	76	" "
71030	71031	71021	71021	they	1461	" "
71085	71086	71079	71079	Caroline	120	" "
71097	71102	71090	71090	I	0	" retorted Edward impatiently ; "
71178	71179	71171	71171	I	0	" "
71216	71217	71209	71209	I	0	" "
71271	71272	71275	71275	Edward	76	" "
71287	71296	71301	71301	you	113	" she replied imploringly , and shrinking back . "
71327	71336	71341	71341	you	113	" exclaimed Edward , irritated beyond all forbearance ; "
71380	71436	71437	71437	Edward	76	" Ellen made no reply , though the tears started to her eyes ; but as usual her firmness deserted her . The heavy stand was carefully moved a little forward , without injuring any of the plants ; the book was obtained , and at that moment the voice of Percy was heard exclaiming — "
71483	71802	71457	71457	he	3546	" Edward did not wait to hear much more than his name , but darted off , leaving his sister to push back the stand . Ellen felt almost sure she could not do it by herself ; but how was she to act ? To ask assistance would not only be confessing her own disobedience , but inculpating her brother , and really , perhaps , deprive him of the enjoyments he anticipated , and so confirm his unkind words . She tried to replace it , and thought she had quite succeeded ; but as she moved it , one of the myrtles fell to the ground , and its beautiful blossom hung on the stalk , preserved from being quite broken off only by three or four delicate fibers . It was Caroline 's favorite plant ; one she so cherished and tended , that Percy called it her petted child ; and poor Ellen stood paralyzed ; she raised the pot mechanically , and rested the broken head of the flower against the still uninjured sprig , and it looked so well and natural , that the thought for a moment darted across her mind that after all it might not be discovered . Then came all her aunt 's lessons of the many ways of acting an untruth without words , and , therefore , even if it should not be discovered , it was no comfort ; but could she , dared she , voluntarily confess what must appear a willful disobedience ? If her aunt had been at home , she might in that first moment have gained the necessary courage ; but she was not expected back for two or three hours , and Ellen sat with her face buried in her hands , only conscious of misery , till her cousin 's joyous voice called out from the hall — "
71843	72217	72218	72218	Ellen	113	" And glad to escape from her own thoughts , she hastily collected the various seeds , and ran after him . And Percy was so active , so obliging , so amusing in his queer ways of working and talking , that she almost forgot the impending trial , till she met her aunt and cousins at luncheon . Edward had been so intent , so happy at his business with his uncle , that he had never cast a thought as to how the stand got back ; and after lunch he had to go for a row on the river , and after dinner to attend a lecture on astronomy , which , that night and the one following , was to be given in the town - hall in T—. His uncle and Percy and Herbert were to accompany him , and so , that he should give a thought to any thing disagreeable , was not likely . The day wore on ; Ellen 's little courage had all gone , and she almost unconsciously hoped that nothing would be discovered . Mr. Hamilton and the lads departed at six , and Mrs. Hamilton proposed adjourning to her daughters ' room , to finish an entertaining book that they were reading aloud . She had noticed , with her usual penetration , that all day Ellen evidently shrunk from her eye , and felt quite sure something was wrong again ; but she asked no questions , fearing again to tempt equivocation . Caroline 's passionate exclamation that somebody had broken her beautiful flower , drew the attention of all to the stand , and one glance sufficed to tell Mrs. Hamilton that it had been moved . Her anxious suspicions at once connected this with Ellen 's shrinking manner , and she turned to ask her if she knew any thing about it . But Ellen had disappeared ; and she rang the bell , and inquired of the only domestics whose department ever led them into the room , if they could explain the accident . But neither of them could ; all uniting in declaring , that in the morning the myrtle was quite perfect . "
72249	72266	72232	72232	Percy	99	" exclaimed Caroline , whose temper was sorely tried by this downfall of all her cares . "
72293	72294	72291	72291	her	113	" "
72345	72440	72441	72441	Ellen	113	" The child obeyed . Miss Harcourt had continued working most industriously at the table , without uttering a word , though Mrs. Hamilton 's countenance expressed such unusual perplexity and pain , that it would have seemed kinder to have spoken . One look at Ellen convinced her aunt , and she actually paused before she spoke , dreading the reply almost as much as the child did the question . It was scarcely audible ; it might have been denial , it certainly was not affirmative , for Miss Harcourt instantly exclaimed — "
72504	72505	72499	72499	you	113	" "
72519	72556	72506	72506	I	0	" exclaimed Ellen , bursting into tears ; for that one unjust charge seemed to give back the power of speech , though the violent reproach and invective which burst from Caroline prevented any thing further . "
72582	72589	72557	72557	I	0	" said her mother , quietly ; "
72616	72617	72601	72601	I	0	" "
72628	72629	72632	72632	she	113	" "
72691	72692	72684	72684	you	113	" "
72695	72748	72684	72684	you	113	" replied the child , almost choked with sobs , called forth the more from the contrast which her aunt 's mildness presented to Miss Harcourt 's harshness , and Caroline 's violent anger , and from the painful longing to say that her first disobedience was not entirely her own fault . "
72766	72767	72753	72753	I	0	" "
72770	72793	72753	72753	I	0	" replied Ellen again , and an exclamation at the apparent hardihood of her conduct escaped from both Miss Harcourt and Caroline . "
72828	72851	72823	72823	you	113	" For full a minute Ellen hesitated , thus unhappily confirming the suspicion that when she did reply it was another equivocation . "
72861	72862	72863	72863	I	0	" "
72925	72926	72918	72918	you	113	" "
72966	72973	72958	72958	you	113	" The words were scarcely articulate . "
73183	73361	73174	73174	I	0	" Ellen quitted the room without answering ; but it was several minutes before Mrs. Hamilton could sufficiently conquer the very painful feelings which her niece 's conduct and her own compelled severity excited , to enter into her daughters ' amusements ; but she would not punish them for the misconduct of another ; and , by her exertions , temper to Caroline and cheerfulness to Emmeline ( whose tears of sympathy had almost kept pace with Ellen 's of sorrow ) , gradually returned , and their book became as delightful a recreation as it had been before . Great was Edward 's grief and consternation when he found the effects of what was actually in the first instance his fault ; but he had not sufficient boldness to say so . His aunt had expressly said it was the untruth that had occasioned her greatest displeasure , that if the disobedience had been confessed at once , she would , in consideration of the season , have forgiven it with a very slight rebuke . "
73364	73368	73413	73413	she	113	" he thought , "
73430	73568	73423	73423	she	113	" That he was acting one of equal deliberation , and of far more culpability , if possible — for he was permitting her to bear the whole weight of his fault — never struck him ; if it did , he did not at all understand or believe it . He went to his sister , and offered to confess his share in her fault , and when — as he fully expected — she begged him not , that it could do her no good , and perhaps only get him punished too , his conscience was so perfectly satisfied , that he actually took upon himself to ask her how she could be so foolish and wrong as , when she was asked , not to allow that she had moved it at once — "
73578	73589	73423	73423	she	113	" he said ; and added , almost with irritation , "
73617	73618	73627	73627	Edward	76	" "
73629	73636	73627	73627	Edward	76	" was his sister 's reply ; "
73684	73887	73680	73680	I	0	" and she leaned her head on her arms , which rested on the table , so despondingly , so sorrowfully , that Edward felt too uncomfortable to remain with her . He was satisfied that he could not help her ; but the disagreeable thought would come , that if he had not tempted her to disobey , she would have had no temptation to tell an untruth , and so he sought a variety of active amusements to get rid of the feeling . The continuation of the entertaining astronomical lecture , too , was so very delightful , and Thursday and Friday morning brought so many enjoyments , that he almost forgot her , till startled back into self - reproach by finding that she was not to accompany them on Friday evening to Mr. Howard 's , whose great pleasure was to collect young people around him , and whose soirée in the Christmas holidays , and whose day in the country at midsummer , were anticipated by girls and boys , great and small , with such delight as to pervade the whole year round . Caroline never refused to join Mr. Howard 's parties though they were "
73890	73982	73680	73680	I	0	" and Percy always declared they were as unlike any other person 's as Mr. Howard was unlike a schoolmaster . Ellen had so enjoyed the day in the country , that , timid as she was , she had looked forward to Friday with almost as much delight as Emmeline . In vain Emmeline , Edward , Percy , Herbert , and even Mr. Hamilton entreated , that she might be permitted to go . Mrs. Hamilton 's own kind heart pleaded quite as strongly , but she remained firm . "
73992	74004	73680	73680	I	0	" she said , almost as beseechingly as they had implored ; "
74127	74501	74118	74118	God	85	" The tone and words were so earnest , so sad , that not only did her children cease in their intercession , but all felt still more forcibly the solemn importance of the virtue , in which Ellen had so failed , from the effect of her conduct upon their mother . She was always grieved when they had done wrong , but they never remembered seeing her so very sad as now . Edward , indeed , could scarcely understand this as his cousins did ; but as his aunt still only alluded to the untruth , the qualm of conscience was again silenced , for he had only caused the disobedience . Emmeline asked timidly if she might remain with Ellen , and Edward followed her example , thinking himself very magnanimous in so doing ; but both were refused — and surely he had done enough ! All went — Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton and Miss Harcourt , as well as the young people ; and it was such a happy evening ! First , there was the orrery , that Mr. Howard had prevailed on the lecturer to display first at his house , and Edward was almost wild in his delight ; and then there were some games and intellectual puzzles , that made them all think , as well as enjoy ; and then there were some music and singing and dancing , and every thing was so quiet and orderly , and yet so full of youthful enjoyment , that it was not much wonder there was no longer any room for a sorrowful thought , in any of the young party from Oakwood . Mrs. Hamilton alone thought of Ellen , and again and again accused herself of too great harshness ; for , perhaps , after all , it might have no better effect than kindness ; but what could she do ? She almost envied the quiet , unruffled unconcern of less anxious guardians ; but for her to feel indifferent to her responsibility was impossible . Ellen was so often unwell that her absence did not occasion so much remark as her brother 's or either of her cousins ' would . "
74510	74584	74502	74502	Mamma	80	" was the answer she had desired the children to give to any inquiries , and her character for indulgence was so generally known , that no one suspected any thing more than indisposition . Annie Grahame 's dislike to Ellen might have made her more suspicious , but she was not there . Cecil and Lilla were , with their father , but Miss Grahame did not condescend to attend Mr. Howard 's "
74586	75226	74502	74502	Mamma	80	" parties ; and Caroline , though she would not have allowed it , even to herself , was both happier , and much more inclined to enjoy herself , with the amusements and society offered to her when Annie was not at a party , than when she was . The next night , to Ellen 's disposition , was a greater trial than the Friday . She neither expected , nor hardly wished to be allowed to go to Mr. Howard 's , though , as the affectionate Emmeline had come to wish her good night , and with tears in her eyes repeated the regrets that she was not to go , she felt the bitter disappointment more than in the morning she had thought possible ; but Saturday night it had been her aunt 's custom , from the time she had been at Oakwood , to visit her daughters and niece before they went to sleep , and prepare them for the Sabbath 's rest and enjoyment , by an examination of their conduct during the past week , and full forgiveness of any thing that had been wrong . When younger , Mrs. Hamilton had attended to this duty every night ; but wishing to give them a habit of private prayer and self - examination , independent of her , she had , after Emmeline was twelve years old , set apart the Saturday night , until they were fifteen — old enough for her to relinquish it altogether . It had been such a habit with her own children , that they felt it perfectly natural ; but with Ellen and Edward , from their never having been accustomed to it as young children , she had never felt the duty understood by them , or as satisfactorily performed by herself as with her own . Still , Ellen looked forward to this night as the termination of her banishment ; for great indeed was the offense whose correction extended over the Sabbath . Ellen could not remember one instance since she had been at Oakwood , and when she heard the doors of her cousins ' rooms successively close , and her aunt 's step retreating without approaching hers , she did , indeed , believe herself irreclaimably wicked , or her kind , good aunt , would , at least , have come to her . Mrs. Hamilton had purposely refrained from indulging her own inclinations , as well as comforting Ellen , hoping still more to impress upon her how greatly she had sinned . The impossibility of her perfectly comprehending her niece 's character , while the poor child felt it such a sacred duty to victimize herself , made her far more severe than she would have been , could she have known her real disposition ; but how was it possible she could believe Ellen 's grief as deep and remorseful as it seemed , when a short time afterward she would commit the same faults ? Her task was infinitely more difficult and perplexing than less anxious mothers can have the least idea of . In feverish dreams of her parents , recalling both their deaths , and with alternate wakefulness , fraught with those deadly incomprehensible terrors which some poor children of strong imagination know so well , Ellen 's night passed ; and the next morning she rose , with that painful throbbing in her throat and temples , which always ended with one of those intense and exhausting headaches to which which she had been so subject , but which her aunt 's care and Mr. Maitland 's remedies had much decreased , both in frequency and violence . She went to church , however with the family , as usual . "
75232	75242	74502	74502	Mamma	80	" Percy exclaimed , as they neared the house ; "
75279	75296	75277	75277	Ellen	113	" Ellen withdrew her arm from her brother 's , saying , as she did so — "
75312	75313	75337	75337	Ellen	113	" "
75344	76337	76338	76338	Dear	3435	" His sister did not reply , but shrinking from the look which Mrs. Hamilton , who was passing at the moment , fixed earnestly upon her , she ran into the house . Edward again felt uncomfortable ; in fact , he had done so , so often since the Tuesday morning , that his temper was not half so good as usual . He did not choose to acknowledge , even to himself , that the uncomfortable feeling was self - reproach , and so he vented it more than once in irritation against Ellen , declaring it was so disagreeable she should be in disgrace just then . It was Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton 's custom always to dine on Sundays at half - past one , to allow those of their household who were unable to attend divine service in the morning to go in the afternoon . With regard to themselves and their children they pursued a plan , which many rigid religionists might , perhaps , have condemned , and yet its fruits were very promising . Their great wish was to make the Sabbath a day of love , divine and domestic ; to make their children look to it with joy and anticipation throughout the week as a day quite distinct in its enjoyment from any other ; and for this reason , while their children were young , they only went to church in the morning , the afternoons were devoted to teaching them to know and to love God in His works as well as word , and their evenings to such quiet but happy amusements and literature , as would fill their young hearts with increased thankfulness for their very happy lot . As they grew older , they were perfectly at liberty to do as they pleased with regard to the afternoon church . Herbert , whose ardent desire to enter the ministry increased with his years , generally spent the greater part of Sunday with Mr. Howard , with his parents ' glad and full consent . The contemplation of serious things was his greatest happiness , but Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton did not expect that all their other children were to be like him . They were contented , and intensely thankful also , to perceive that diverse as were their characters , still the constant sense of God 's presence and of His infinite love was active and earnest in them all , inciting love and reverence for Herbert , even though they could not sympathize with him entirely . Another peculiarity of Mr. Hamilton consisted in his permitting no Sunday schools at Aveling and his other villages . The Saturday afternoons were set apart instead of the Sunday . He wished his wife , and daughters when they were old enough , to superintend them , and help the children in preparing for the Sunday services and Sunday enjoyments ; but he particularly disliked the system of overwork on a day of rest , which could not fail to be the case , if there were schools to attend to twice or three times a day , as well as church . It being the last day of the old year , Mr. Howard had expressed a wish that Percy and Edward as well as Herbert should attend church that afternoon , and the lads , without the least reluctance , consented ; Mr. Hamilton and Miss Harcourt were going too , and Caroline and Emmeline , of their own accord , asked permission to accompany them . Ellen 's pale , suffering face had so haunted her aunt , that she could not think of any thing else , and remained for a very much longer time than was usual to her character in a state of indecision . The next night was her children 's ball , and it was too , the first day of the new year — always in her happy circle a festival of joy and thankfulness . Ellen 's face certainly looked as if she had suffered quite enough to prevent the recurrence of her fault , but so it had always done , and yet , before she could possibly have forgotten its consequences , she failed again . Mrs. Hamilton sat for some time , after her children had left her , in meditation , trying to silence the pleadings of affection , and listen only to reason , as to whether continued severity or returning kindness would be the more effective , and save both Ellen and herself any further pain . To the child herself physical suffering was so increasing as gradually to deaden mental , till at last it became so severe , that she felt sick and faint . She knew the medicine she was in the habit of taking when similarly suffering , and the lotion which her aunt applied to her forehead , and which always succeeded in removing the excessive throbbing , were both in Mrs. Hamilton 's dressing - room ; but it seemed quite impossible that she could get at them , for she did not like to leave her room without permission , nor did she feel as if she could walk so far , her head throbbing with increased violence with every step she took . At length she summoned sufficient courage to ring the bell , and beg Fanny to ask Ellis to come to her . The girl , who had been already dreadfully concerned that Miss Ellen had eaten no dinner , and on Sunday too ! gave such an account of her , that the housekeeper hastened to her directly , and begged her to let her go for her mistress — it was so lucky she had not gone to church — but Ellen clung to her , imploring her not . "
76410	76411	76418	76418	she	3424	" "
76467	76468	76459	76459	she	171	" "
76510	76593	76594	76594	I	0	" And seeing that farther argument only increased the poor child 's sufferings , Ellis promised , and left her . Ellen leaned her forehead against the side of her little bed , and held the curtain tightly clasped , as if so to prevent the utterance of the hysteric sob that would rise in her throat , though she did not know what it was . But the wholly unexpected sound of Mrs. Hamilton 's voice saying , close by her , "
76608	76648	76606	76606	Ellen	113	" so startled her , as to make her raise her head suddenly ; and the movement caused such agony , that , spite of all her efforts , she could not prevent an almost convulsive cry of pain . "
76688	76689	76686	76686	Ellen	113	" "
76702	76734	76690	76691	Miss Ellen	113	" rejoined Ellis , who , to her mistress 's inexpressible relief , was close at hand with the remedies she wanted , and she repeated what the child had said . "
76858	77110	77111	77111	You	1499	" And for above an hour did Mrs. Hamilton , with the most patient tenderness , apply the usual remedies , cheered by finding that , though much more slowly than usual , still by degrees the violence of the pain did subside , and the hysterical affection give way to natural and quiet tears . Exhaustion produced a deep though not very long sleep , and after watching her some few minutes very anxiously , Mrs. Hamilton sat down by her bed , and half unconsciously drew toward her Ellen 's little Bible , which lay open on the table , as if it had been only lately used . Several loose papers were between the leaves ; her eyes filled with tears as she read on one of them a little prayer , touching from the very childishness of the language and imperfect writing , beseeching her Father in Heaven in His great mercy to forgive her sin , and give her courage to speak the truth , to help her not to be so frightened , but to guide her in her difficult path . Mrs. Hamilton little guessed how difficult it was , but she hoped more from the effects of her present penitence than she had done yet . She had copied , too , several verses from the various parts of the Old and New Testament which were condemnatory of falsehood , and her aunt felt no longer undecided as to her course of action . "
77124	77150	77111	77111	You	1499	" she said , as , when the child awoke and looked anxiously toward her — she kissed her cheek with even more than her usual fondness—"that
77220	77427	77217	77217	you	113	" And when Ellen had taken the delicious cup of coffee , which her aunt had ordered should be ready for her directly she awoke , and sat up , though her head was still so weak it required the support of a pillow , yet she seemed so revived , so almost happy , from the mesmeric effect of that warm , fond kiss , that her aunt did not hesitate to continue the lesson she was so anxious to impress , while the mind and heart were softened to receive it . She turned to the fourth chapter of the second book of Kings , and after briefly relating the story of Naaman — for she did not wish to divert Ellen 's attention from the one important subject , by giving any new ideas — she read from the 20th verse to the end , and so brought the nature of Gehazi 's sin and its awful punishment , at the hand of God himself ( for the prophet was merely an instrument of the Eternal , he had no power in himself to call the disease of leprosy on his servant ) to Ellen 's mind , that she never forgot it . "
77449	77461	77445	77445	he	177	" she ventured timidly to inquire , as her aunt ceased ; "
77483	77484	77487	77487	he	85	" "
77513	77519	77520	77520	he	177	so"—and she read the 26th verse again—"but
77706	77707	77736	77736	God	85	" "
77715	77721	77736	77736	God	85	" repeated Ellen , fearfully . "
77956	77987	77952	77952	He	85	" She read from the 18th to the 22d verse of the third chapter , and explained it , so that Ellen could clearly understand it , and then said . "
78028	78067	78068	78068	I	0	" Ellen 's arms were round her neck in a moment , and her head cradled on her bosom , as her sole reply , for she felt she could not speak at first , without crying again . "
78081	78093	78074	78074	God	85	" she said after a short pause , and very sadly . "
78120	78121	78112	78112	I	0	" "
78143	78172	78123	78123	you	113	" The child had not ; and her aunt turning to the 129th , read the first twelve and the two last verses carefully with her , adding — "
78237	78238	78228	78228	I	0	" "
78250	78257	78258	78258	I	0	" replied Ellen , very earnestly ; "
78284	78285	78286	78286	I	0	" "
78398	78446	78367	78367	you	113	" Ellen looked up in her face with such earnest , wistful eyes that Mrs. Hamilton felt puzzled ; but as she did not speak , and laid her head again on its resting place , to hide the tears that rose , her aunt merely added — "
78566	78623	78558	78558	you	113	" and Mrs. Hamilton fondly kissed her as she spoke . Light steps and a ringing laugh at that moment sounded in the passage , and Emmeline , though she certainly did ask if she might enter , scarcely waited for an answer , before she bounded in , the very personification of health and joy . "
78651	78652	78626	78626	papa	3546	" "
78660	78681	78626	78626	papa	3546	" pleaded another joyous voice , and Percy 's brown head just intruded itself through the half - opened door ; "
78696	78697	78698	78698	I	0	" "
78739	78740	78741	78741	He	3546	" "
78789	78790	78787	78787	sir	3463	" "
78849	78850	78837	78837	she	113	" "
78873	78909	78860	78860	you	3420	" asked Mrs. Hamilton , anxiously , for the sudden joy that gleamed in Ellen 's eyes at the idea of joining the family , told what the disappointment would be if she could not . "
78936	78953	78926	78926	I	0	" she added , sorrowfully , as the attempt to walk caused it to throb again . "
78975	78981	78983	78983	your	113	" replied Percy , joyously ; "
79008	79065	79066	79066	You	113	" And gayly answering in the affirmative , his mother could scarcely prevent a throb of pride , as she looked on his fine manly face , beaming with benevolent kindness on his little cousin , whom he had tenderly lifted in his arms , and checked his boisterous mirth and rapid stride to accommodate her . "
79099	79100	79131	79131	You	113	" "
79111	79117	79103	79103	I	0	" exclaimed Emmeline , eagerly ; "
79129	79130	79131	79131	You	113	" "
79141	79148	79139	79139	Emmy	121	" said her mother , smiling ; "
79178	81199	79170	79170	I	0	" The lights , the joyous voices , even her uncle 's kind greeting , almost overpowered poor Ellen ; as Percy , still preserving his character of an admirable nurse , laid her carefully on a couch in the sitting - room , where not only tea was waiting , but the celebrated family tree , which Mrs. Hamilton 's anxiety and Ellen 's sorrow had caused them both to forget , was displayed with even more than usual taste and beauty . Mr. Hamilton , when young , had been a great deal with his father in Germany , Denmark , and Sweden , and brought from the first and latter country certain domestic observances which had especially pleased him , as so greatly enhancing the enjoyments of home , and helping to a right understanding between parents and children , by increasing their mutual love and confidence . The family tree , or Christmas Tree , as it was called , was one of these , and from their earliest years it had been one of the children 's greatest delights on New Year 's Eve . Of course , as they grew older , and their taste improved , the tree itself , its suspended presents , and its surrounding decorations increased in beauty , and it had never been prettier than it was this year . The whole of the preceding afternoon had the young artists labored in preparing it , for of course , as the next day was Sunday , it was obliged to be all finished by the Saturday night ; the servants , eager in all things to enhance the happiness of those whose parents made them so happy , did not care what trouble they took to help them . They always selected the room in which there was a very lofty and very deep oriel window , in the center of which recess ( which was almost as large as a moderately sized room ) they placed the tree , which was a very large , gracefully - cut spruce fir ; it was placed in a tub filled with the same soil as that in which the tree grew , so that by watering and care it remained fresh for some time . The tub which contained it , was completely hidden by the flowering shrubs that were placed round it , rising in an expanding pyramid , by means of several flower - stands , till the recess seemed one mass of leaf and flower ; among which the superb scarlet geranium , that in Devonshire grows so luxuriantly all through the winter , shining against its own beautiful leaf , the brilliant berries of the holly , with their dark glistening branches , the snow - berry and flowering myrtle , shone pre - eminent . Small lamps glittered through the flowers , and were suspended in sufficient profusion from the pendent branches of the tree to half reveal and half hide the various gifts and treasures that were there deposited ; and altogether the effect , from every part of the room , was really striking . The tree always remained till after their ball , but , the interchange of gifts which took place on New Year 's Eve , causing so many peculiarly happy and home feelings , was confined to the family group ; Mr. Howard always included . Many weeks before had each individual worked at his own secret undertaking . If it could not all be done in private , no questions were ever asked , and each helped the other to keep it at least from their parents till the eventful night itself . They formed so large a party altogether , as little tokens of affection between the brothers and sisters were also exchanged , that the tree was quite loaded , and many a time had Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton discovered some trait of character or some ruling fancy , even in such a simple thing as the manufacture and presentation of home gifts . Their own idea of family ties was so strong and so holy , that one great aim in the education of their children was to make them not only love each other , but have thought and attention for individual feelings and wishes , and so heighten feeling by action , not depend entirely on natural ties . Mrs. Hamilton had known many young persons who were lavish in attentions and even presents to friends , but never imagined that their own home circle had the first and strongest claim to kindness , whether of word or deed . She knew that affections and thought lavished on comparative strangers never radiated on home , but that when given to home first , they shed light and kindliness far and near . Their tea was indeed a mirthful one ; Ellen had been very fearful of meeting Mr. Howard , for she thought he must have been told how naughty she had been ; but if he had , there was nothing in his manner to say so ; for he shook hands with her , and even kissed her most kindly , and told her , laughingly , that she must be quite well by the next night , or how was she to dance ? That he thought it would be a good thing if Emmeline could give her a little of her dancing mania , as she hardly ever only walked , even when she called herself quite sober . Edward , every passing thought of self - reproach banished by his sister 's return to favor , was in the wildest spirits ; Percy and Emmeline seemed to have laid a wager who could say the wittiest things and laugh the most . Herbert was very quiet , but looking as happy as the rest , and quite entering into their mirth , and showing all sorts of little gentle attentions to Ellen , who had seemed to shrink from his eye , more than from all the others . Caroline fully entered into the spirit of the evening , but neither she nor Miss Harcourt took the same notice of Ellen as the rest . The person who was to act the Wizard 's part , and by means of a long wand detach the various treasures from the tree , and carry them to the owners whose names they bore , was always chosen by lot ; and great was the delight of the young party , when this night the office fell on Mr. Howard . No one seemed more pleased than himself , performing it with such a spirit of enjoyment and originality , that a general vote declared him the very choicest wizard they had ever had . To enumerate all the contents of that marvelous tree would be impossible . Their parents ' gifts to each of them were not in the tree , but always given afterward ; but great was the delight , when , after a terrible tussle to detach a large roll of cloth , down it came , right on Mr. Howard 's head , and almost enveloped him with its folds , and proved to be a beautiful cover , which he had long desired for a favorite table in his drawing - room at the embroidered border of which , not only the three girls , but Mrs. Hamilton and Miss Harcourt had all worked , as a joint offering of love and respect . This good man was so charmed , that he declared he would not use his wand again till he had full five minutes to admire it . Then there was a very pretty , comfortable pair of slippers , worked by Caroline and Emmeline for their father , and a pair of braces worked by Ellen , all accompanied by some most ludicrous , but very clever verses from Percy . Edward , who was very ingenious , had turned a very pretty stand for his uncle to put his watch in at night ; and manufactured two little vessels out of cork for his aunt , so delicately , and neatly , that she promised him they should stand on the mantelpiece of her dressing - room , as long as they would last . Caroline had knitted her mother a very pretty bag , and Emmeline and Ellen had collected for her a variety of leaves throughout the year , and arranged them with great taste , both as to grouping and tinting , in a sort of small herbal , with two or three lines of poetry , selected and carefully written by each alternately , attached to each page . Mrs. Hamilton was excessively pleased , as she was also with a portfolio formed by drawings from both her boys , and tastefully made up by Miss Harcourt ; and with their gifts to their father , a correct and most beautifully written out Greek poem , which Mr. Hamilton had several months , if not more than a year before , expressed a wish to possess , but the volume which contained it was so scarce , and so expensive from the quantity of uninteresting matter in which the gem was buried , that he had given up all thought of it . Herbert , however , had not , and never rested from the time his father spoke , till he had found and copied it — a task of no small difficulty , for the original was in many parts almost entirely effaced , and , if Herbert had not been an admirable Greek scholar , and a quick imaginator as to what it ought to be , Mr. Howard himself had said he could not have succeeded . The writing of the Greek character was most beautiful , and Percy , in imitation of the ancient missals , had designed and painted an elegant illuminated border round it , and a beautiful cover , forming a thin volume , so valuable , their father delighted them by saying , that he would not exchange it for twenty of the most precious volumes in his library . Such evidences of the home influence they had given , in permitting leisure for the cultivation of taste and imagination , teaching them the beautiful , and opening innumerable resources of enjoyment within themselves , and thence allowing them to enhance the pleasures of others , were indeed most gratifying to those earnest and affectionate guardians . From their earliest years they had been taught , that to give the greatest amount of pleasure to their parents , their gifts must be all , or at least have something in them , of their own workmanship , and to enable them to do this , the lads had been taught in their hours of recreation to use all sorts of tools , visiting and knowing something of a variety of handicrafts ; and the girls to work and draw , and even bring the stores of Nature to their aid when needed , as in the present case , with Emmeline and Ellen 's tasteful gift . Our young readers must call upon their own imagination as to the other treasures of this valuable tree ; for , as they would , no doubt , like to know what sort of New Year 's gifts Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton had in store for their children ( for Miss Harcourt too , for they never omitted her ) , we really must not linger round it any longer . Poor Ellen , indeed , had the pain of feeling that her fault and its consequences had prevented the completion of her purse for Percy , and a chain for Edward , and her cheek burned very painfully , when Mr. Howard , after exhausting the tree , exclaimed — "
81233	81234	81235	81235	We	1545	" "
81255	81279	81242	81244	most potent conjuror	1546	" answered Percy , directly ; and bending over Ellen , by whom he chanced to be standing , he said , kindly , "
81296	81297	81283	81283	Nelly	113	" "
81325	81372	81311	81311	I	0	" said his mother , in the same low tone , as only to be heard by him and Ellen . ( Mr. Howard was very quick - sighted , and he took Percy 's jest and turned off all farther notice of his words . ) "
81410	81411	81412	81412	I	0	" "
81426	81437	81412	81412	I	0	" was Ellen 's earnest and humble reply ; adding , "
81451	81452	81446	81446	you	0	" "
81457	81463	81446	81446	you	0	" was his laughing answer . "
81473	81477	81478	81478	I	0	" he added ; "
81485	81486	81478	81478	I	0	" "
81499	81504	81478	81478	I	0	" replied Mr. Howard , "
81532	81533	81525	81525	her	120	" "
81555	81605	81637	81637	She	135	" exclaimed Caroline , joyfully , as , removing a hollow pyramid of green and white paper , a myrtle was discovered of the same rare kind , and almost in as beautiful flower as the one whose death had caused such increased coldness in her feelings toward Ellen . "
81619	81620	81621	81621	Ellis	135	" "
81632	81636	81637	81637	She	135	" answered Ellen . "
81717	81718	81719	81719	Ellis	135	" "
81739	81746	81719	81719	Ellis	135	" said her uncle , kindly ; "
81810	81811	81814	81814	papa	3546	" "
81828	81835	81816	81816	you	3546	" said Caroline , very earnestly . "
81876	81891	81874	81874	Ellen	113	" she continued much more cordially than she had yet spoken to her cousin ; "
81930	82115	81874	81874	Ellen	113	" It did indeed bear out its language , that pretty flower , for , with this one coldness removed — though Mrs. Hamilton 's trembling heart dared not hope it would be lasting — love now reigned pre - eminent . Every happy feeling increased when in the presents from their parents each recognized something that had been wished for , though they never remembered expressing it . Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton were always united in these New Year 's gifts , though tokens of approval or occasional indulgences were often given separately . There were a set of most beautiful engravings for Percy , which for the last three or four months he had been most anxious to possess ; but with the recollection of former folly very fresh in his memory , he had actually succeeded in driving them from his mind , and gave them up as unattainable , till he was richer , at least . For Herbert there was a fine edition of the Greek tragedians in their original , as beautiful a work of art , in its "
82119	82307	81874	81874	Ellen	113	" as Percy called it , as its letter - press , which to Herbert was beyond all price . Edward was almost wild , as his uncle and aunt telling him he was fourteen next March , and might not be with them next New Year 's eve , presented him with a treasure coveted beyond all other , a gold watch . ( His father 's had been given by his mother as a parting gift to Captain Cameron . ) Mr. Howard declared that it was much too good for a sailor , and would be lost his first voyage ; he had much better hand it over to the Rectory , promising to take every care of it ; but looking so mischievous , Edward vowed it should not get near his hand . For Caroline was a most complete and elegantly fitted - up embroidery - box , which quite charmed her , for it was exactly like , if not more tasteful and complete , than one Annie Grahame had brought from London , and which she had wondered , Caroline could "
82309	82324	81874	81874	Ellen	113	" without . As Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton found that she could not only comfortably "
82327	82432	82439	82439	yourself	1555	" but much as she admired and had at first so coveted it , as to have a hard battle with discontent , she had never even hinted that it might be useful . As they perceived that her mind was so happily engrossed by the idea of the pleasure her gifts would bestow , as not to cast a thought upon Annie 's superior box , they indulged themselves and their child , and were more than repaid by the beaming look of delight with which it was received . For Emmeline was a parcel almost as large as herself , Percy declared . "
82509	82542	82463	82463	mamma	3420	" he continued , laughing at his sister 's almost scream of delight , as she undid the covering of a book , and found it to be the complete poem of the "
82548	82591	82463	82463	mamma	3420	" extracts of which she had read in the reviews , and so reveled in them , child as she was , as to commit them all to memory , with scarce an effort , only longing to know the whole story . "
82694	82695	82675	82675	mamma	3420	" "
82732	82739	82740	82740	I	0	" said her uncle , smiling ; "
82750	82751	82740	82740	I	0	" "
82844	82910	82840	82840	us	1567	" and he dragged a table to her sofa , and displayed to the delighted child all its fittings - up , and its conveniences , and the pretty pen - holder and pencil - case , and fancy wafers , and sealing - wax , and a little gold seal with her own name , and every thing that could possibly be thought of . "
82917	82927	82840	82840	us	1567	" exclaimed Percy , quite proud of the discovery . "
82972	83751	82966	82966	I	0	" and he laughingly sent away every body while he explained to Ellen the spring . For some little while longer did the young party examine and re - examine and talk of their own and each other 's treasures . And then Mr. Hamilton bade them remember , that , though it was New Year 's Eve , it was Sunday evening , too,[1 ] and that he had deferred the hour of evening prayer till ten , that they might have time to keep both , and so not lose the sacred music which was always part of their Sunday recreation , to put away their things , and adjourn to their music - room . And he was obeyed in a very few minutes ; for though they might have preferred lingering and talking where they were , what exertion could be too great for those who so thought of , so cared for them ? Returning happiness had had such a beneficial effect , that , though Ellen still looked pale enough for her aunt not to feel quite comfortable about her , she could walk without any return of pain , and in one or two hymns even join her voice with her cousins ' , though it was weaker than usual . However small in appearance the talent for music , still Mrs. Hamilton cultivated it , in her boys as well as her girls , simply for the sake of giving them home resources and amusements that could be pursued together ; she thought it such a mistaken notion in education to imagine that only perfection was worth attaining in the fine arts , and that , if there were not talent enough for that , it was better not attempted . Many a home might have envied the feelings with which old and young , to the lowest domestics , sought their pillows that night ; for Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton , so lavish in their indulgence to their children , never forgot that for their domestics and retainers there were also claims on New Year 's Eve ; and the servants ' hall , and every cottage which called Mr. Hamilton landlord , had vied in happiness with his own . Mrs. Hamilton had visited Ellen the last thing , to see that she was quite comfortable , and that there was no return of pain ; and she was almost startled , and certainly still more bewildered as to how such a depth of feeling could exist with such a real childish liability to error , and why it should be so carefully concealed , by the way in which Ellen clung to her , as she bent over her to wish her good night , with the same unrestrained affection as her own Emmeline did so often , with the only difference , that with the latter it seemed always to spring from the very exuberance of happiness , which could only be thus displayed . With Ellen , this night , it appeared like some deep , quiet feeling , almost of devotion , and as if — though Mrs. Hamilton 's sober reason tried to persuade her imagination that it was too much meaning to attach to a mere embrace — she would thus tell her how intensely she felt , not only the indulgence of that evening , but the true kindness and watchful love which had caused the preceding sorrow . She might have thought , as no doubt many of our readers will , that Ellen was much too young and too childish , to contrast her system of treatment with her poor mother 's ; that she felt her soothing care in her hours of physical suffering — her indulgent love making no distinction between her and her cousins — still the more keenly and gratefully , from the recollection of her own mother 's constant preference of Edward , and utter neglect of her ; and that this contrast so deepened the love she bore her aunt , that it exceeded in intensity even that borne toward her by her own children.—Adults will think this all very fanciful , and perhaps interesting , but wholly improbable . Mrs. Hamilton herself would have banished the idea , as too imaginary to be entertained seriously for a moment , as any guide for her conduct . Ellen herself could not have explained or told herself that so she felt ; and yet , notwithstanding , all we have written was there , and was the real prompter of that almost passionate embrace . "
83758	83974	82966	82966	I	0	" was Mrs. Hamilton 's fond reply , instead of permitting the child to perceive the surprise it excited in herself ; and Ellen sunk to sleep , almost more happy than ever , in her little life , she had felt before . If the thought of their promised ball were the first that entered the minds of the young party at Oakwood , as they opened their eyes on New Year 's day , it was not very unnatural . Percy gloried in the anticipation of being master of the ceremonies , and in conducting the whole affair with such inimitable grace and gallantry , that every one should declare it was far superior to any party , old or young , of the season , except Mr. Howard 's ; that was beyond him , he said , for he could not put Mr. Howard 's head on his shoulders . Herbert anticipated the enjoyment of Mary Greville 's society , talking to and dancing with her undisturbed , and to hearing the almost universal remark , what a sweet girl she was . Edward did not exactly know what he expected , but he was in such a mood of hilarity and mischief , that the servants all declared Master Fortescue was "
83977	84853	82966	82966	I	0	" To Caroline their ball was almost always ( though unconfessedly ) the happiest evening in the year . She knew she was handsome — Annie Grahame had told her how very much she would be admired in London , and that if she were not her very dearest friend , she should envy her beauty terribly . She often in secret longed painfully for admiration and homage ; and child as she still was in years , yet at her own house , and as Mr. Hamilton 's eldest daughter , in addition to her real attractions , she always received both in sufficient measure , as to satisfy even herself . She delighted in those evenings when it so chanced that her brothers had young friends with them , making no hesitation in confessing that she very much preferred conversing with boys than with girls , there was so much more variety , more spirit ; and though her mother 's heart would actually tremble at the fearful ordeal which an introduction to the pleasures of the world would be to such a character , still she would not check the open expression of such sentiments by reproving them as wrong , and not to be encouraged . She knew that though education might do much , very much , it could not make natural characters all alike ; nor , in fact , did she wish it . She did not grieve and complain that , with all her efforts she could not make Caroline give her as little trouble and anxiety as Emmeline , nor did she imagine that she should see the effect of her earnest prayers and cares all at once , or without constant relapses in the cherished object of her care . She did all she could to counteract a tendency which , situated as she would be when she entered life , must , without some strong , high principle , lead to suffering , and , perhaps , to sin — for what is coquetry ? But she indulged in no idea of security , never believed that because she had so tried , so striven to sow the good seed , it could not fail to bring forth good fruit . She knew many trials might be in store for her ; for how might she hope to pass through life blessed as she was then ? It might please her Father in Heaven to try her faith and duty through those she loved so intensely ; but if she failed not in her task , he would bring her joy at last . To Emmeline the idea of dancing was quite enough to be the acme of enjoyment . The only drawback was , that in the intervals of rest , there was to be a little music , and though her mother had excused her at Mr. Howard 's , she knew that if anybody expressed a wish to hear her at her own house , play she must ; and at those times she was half sorry she had chosen to learn the harp instead of the piano , as Caroline played so well on the latter instrument nobody would care to hear her ; but the harp was rather a novelty , and no little girl who was coming played it , and so she was sadly afraid there was no escape for her , and that was very disagreeable , but she would not think about it till the time came ; the dancing to such music as that which Mr. Hamilton had ordered from Plymouth was joy enough . Ellen though rather afraid of so many strangers , could not resist the general contagion of anticipated enjoyment . She did not indeed wake with the thought of the ball , but with the determination to learn the verse of the Psalm her aunt had pointed out , and go and say it to her in her dressing - room before she went down . And as the first verse was very short she learned two , and repeated them without missing a word , and so as if she quite understood them , that her aunt was very much pleased ; and then Ellen could think of and join her brother 's and cousins ' delight , even though Mrs. Hamilton was obliged to be what she called very cruel , but what Ellen knew was very kind , though it did seem a restraint , and keep her very quiet all day , instead of letting her run about from room to room , as Emmeline and Edward , and even Percy did , for fear of another headache ; and so well did quietness succeed , that she looked and was unusually well , and so was almost lively by the evening . Just before dinner , Percy , who had gone to ride , because he said he was sure he should get into some scrape if he did not give a natural vent to his spirits , galloped back in company with a gentleman , whose presence seemed to occasion him still greater excitement . "
84866	84921	84922	84922	Mother	3430	" he asked impatiently , flinging his horse 's rein to Robert , desiring him to take every care of the gentleman 's horse , as he should not let him leave Oakwood that night ; and rushing across the hall threw open the door of their common sitting - room , and exclaimed — "
85005	85006	84967	84968	a slave	3477	" "
85012	85030	85031	85031	your	3430	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , rising with very evident pleasure , and coming forward with extended hand ; "
85052	85072	85049	85050	Mr. Morton	162	" she added , addressing the young clergyman with that earnest kindness , which always goes to the heart , "
85107	85108	85109	85109	I	0	" "
85131	85139	85122	85123	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" replied Mr. Morton , almost sadly ; "
85206	85519	85201	85201	his	81	" he continued , more gayly . And Mr. Hamilton and Herbert entering as he spoke , their greeting was quite as warm and eager as Percy 's and his mother 's , and Mr. Morton gave himself up , for the evening at least , to enjoyment . His own generous nature had been particularly struck by Percy 's manly conduct with regard to his satire , and different as were their characters , a warm friendship from that moment commenced between them . It was impossible to resist Percy 's warm - heartedness of word and deed ; and that he would sometimes leave his luxurious home , and stay two or three days with Mr. Morton , seeming actually to enjoy the rude cottage and its desolate localities , and spread such a spirit of mirth within and around , that it was no wonder the afflicted young man looked to his society as almost his greatest pleasure , especially as he felt he dared not too often accept Mr. Hamilton 's continually - proffered invitation . Oakwood was the home which had been his beau idéal for long years , but which now seemed wholly unattainable . He felt himself doomed to solitude and suffering , and the struggle for content and cheerfulness was always more painful after he had been with his friends . When all preparations for the evening were concluded , even the respective toilets completed , Percy and Emmeline found it impossible to resist trying the spring , as they called it , of the oaken floors ( whence the carpets had been removed ) , and amused themselves by waltzing in the largest circle they could make . The beautiful suite of rooms were all thrown open , and perceiving Caroline standing by the piano in an adjoining apartment , Percy called out — "
85568	85569	85570	85570	You	0	" "
85577	85583	85570	85570	You	0	" she replied somewhat pettishly . "
85614	85615	85607	85607	they	1586	" "
85633	85639	85621	85621	you	120	" answered Percy , laughing ; "
85655	85656	85657	85657	You	0	" "
85688	85695	85681	85681	I	0	" was her as joyous rejoinder . "
85708	85734	85700	85700	Caroline	120	" exclaimed Edward , who after decorating his button - hole with a sprig of holly , seemed seized with Percy 's dancing - mania . "
85753	85754	85755	85755	My	0	" "
85777	85784	85773	85773	yourself	0	" was Caroline 's quick reply . "
85793	85814	85791	85791	Lina	108	" observed her brother , very dryly ; and as Emmeline begged him not to tease her , he asked — "
85827	85828	85825	85825	Emmy	121	" "
85850	85851	85844	85844	she	108	" "
85876	85877	85874	85874	you	120	" "
85909	85927	85894	85894	I	0	" said his little sister , shaking her head at him with a comic species of reproach . "
85943	85954	85932	85932	Emmy	121	" said her father , coming forward with a smile ; "
85965	85966	85971	85971	papa	3546	" "
85985	85986	85971	85971	papa	3546	" "
85993	86006	85991	85991	Emmeline	78	" rejoined Percy , shrugging his shoulders with horror at the idea ; "
86021	86022	86007	86007	I	0	" "
86046	86051	86033	86033	you	78	" continued Mr. Hamilton , "
86061	86062	86068	86068	papa	3546	" "
86111	86112	86100	86100	Fanny	170	" "
86127	86135	86114	86114	you	3546	" said Percy , with marked emphasis , "
86158	86159	86151	86152	one sister	1592	" "
86170	86171	86176	86176	he	3546	" "
86187	86199	86184	86184	he	3546	" answered Emmeline , very eagerly ; but Percy said impetuously — "
86253	86297	86309	86310	aunt Emmeline	78	" Caroline had fortunately quitted the music - room , or this speech would not have tended to restore her serenity ; but before Mr. Hamilton could reply , Edward , who had been to seek Ellen , burst into the room exclaiming — "
86337	86414	86324	86324	she	120	" and they enjoyed it in earnest . Mr. Hamilton watched them for a few minutes , and then went to seek his elder girl . She was alone in a little room prepared for refreshments , tastefully arranging some beautiful flowers in a bouquet . She looked up as he entered , and so smiled that her fond father thought Percy must be wrong , for there certainly seemed no trace of ill - temper . "
86451	86470	86436	86436	you	1597	" he asked , but so kindly , that Caroline , though she blushed deeply , instantly replied — "
86523	86534	86521	86521	papa	3546	" she added , looking up earnestly in his face , "
86542	86543	86546	86546	he	3473	" "
86592	86611	86578	86578	me	0	" Caroline 's blush became still deeper , and she turned away her head saying , very hesitatingly — "
86632	86633	86624	86624	I	0	" "
86679	86680	86688	86688	I	0	" "
86713	86714	86696	86696	mamma	80	" "
86729	86751	86756	86756	I	0	" replied her father , kissing her glowing cheek so affectionately , that the pain of her confession was instantly soothed ; "
86928	86934	86923	86923	I	0	" he added , playfully . "
87018	87042	87045	87045	mamma	3420	" he added , tastefully twining a superb sprig of scarlet geranium in the rich dark hair that shaded Caroline 's noble brow ; "
87075	87119	87123	87123	mamma	3420	" Caroline 's brilliant eye sparkled with a more delightful sense of pleasure than any triumph of dress could have bestowed , and in answer to her father 's inquiry , for whom she had arranged such a beautiful bouquet , she said — "
87170	87411	87151	87151	she	3420	" and she hastened with her father to the drawing - room , where she found Mrs. Greville and her two children ( for Alfred was at home for a few months ) , in addition to Mr. Morton and their own family group ; and the young clergyman could not but admire the natural grace with which Caroline , after warmly welcoming her guests , presented her flowers to her mother . It was a very little thing , but the joys and griefs of home are almost all made up of little things , and Mrs. Hamilton was pleased , not from the attention alone , but that it proved , trifling as it was , that the annoyance and discontent which her command had occasioned in her child had left no unkind feeling behind them ; and the manner with which she received it made Caroline very happy , for she had inwardly feared her ill - temper not only deserved , but had excited her mother 's displeasure . Emmeline 's look of disappointment and self - reproach at her own unusual forgetfulness was so irresistibly comic , that Percy and Edward burst into an immoderate fit of laughter , which the former only checked to ask Caroline where she had been , and what she had done , to produce such an extraordinary change for the better in her appearance in so short a time . "
87424	87433	87422	87422	Percy	99	" was her perfectly good - humored reply ; "
87460	87461	87452	87458	papa , who has produced the change	1627	" "
87473	87478	87470	87470	I	0	" said Mrs. Hamilton ; "
87525	87819	87518	87519	Mr. Hamilton	81	" The rapid succession of arrivals prevented any further remark , and very speedily the inspiring sound of the beautiful music , which was stationed in a sort of ante - chamber between the drawing - room and ball - room , removed any thing like stiffness or reserve which the younger guests might have at first experienced among themselves . After two or three quadrilles , the spirit of enjoyment seemed to reign alone , not only among the dancers themselves , but even those who sat out and talked , either from preference or because the sets were full . Percy , his brother , and cousin , were so active , so universal in their attention and politeness , that all had the same measure of enjoyment ; there was no sitting down four or five times consecutively for any one , and therefore neither weariness nor dissatisfaction . Where there is a great desire in the givers of a party to make every one as happy as themselves , and thoroughly to enjoy it , they seldom fail to succeed . And there was such a variety of amusements in the various rooms that were thrown open , suitable for all ages — from the mammas and papas to the youngest child , that it was scarcely possible to feel any thing but pleasure . Very many sets had been formed and danced before the Grahame family appeared , and as Caroline glanced at her friend and even at her little sister , it required a very vivid recollection of her father 's words to prevent a feeling of false shame , while Annie looked at Emmeline and even her favorite Caroline for a few minutes with almost contempt . "
87831	87835	87826	87827	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" she thought , "
87885	87983	87984	87984	You	1636	" If looks were evidence of envy , Annie had them to her heart 's content , but how would she have been mortified , could she have read the secret meaning of those looks , the contrast drawn between the manners and appearance of Lady Helen 's daughters and those of the Honorable Mrs. Hamilton . Lady Helen herself , indeed , when she saw Caroline and Emmeline , was quite provoked that she had been so weak as to permit , and even encourage Annie , to select her own and her sister 's costume . "
87989	88002	87984	87984	You	1636	" said Mrs. Hamilton , as she came forward to greet them , "
88027	88028	88018	88018	I	0	" "
88033	88046	88018	88018	I	0	" was Mr. Grahame 's reply , and it was almost bitter ; "
88100	88117	88118	88118	I	0	" Lady Helen 's look of entreaty at Mrs. Hamilton was answered by her saying directly — "
88162	88179	88181	88181	I	0	" she added , jestingly , though the young lady felt it rather uncomfortably as earnest , "
88190	88215	88181	88181	I	0	" Alfred Greville at that moment came to claim Annie as his partner , and she gladly joined him , for though Mrs. Hamilton had "
88222	88451	88452	88452	I	0	" she never felt quite at her ease in her presence . Cecil and Lilla were soon provided with little partners , and dancing with much more real delight than their sister . It was scarcely possible for any one , much less a parent , to look at Caroline that night without admiration . She was so animated , so graceful , so pleasing , and as such completely the center of attraction ( and really without any effort on her part ) to all the gentlemen , young or old in the room . The lads congregated round her , and it was rather a difficult task to keep clear of offense , when so very many more entreated her to dance than the length of the evening permitted ; but she managed to talk to all , and yet not to neglect any of her own sex , for she always refused to dance , if she fancied her being in a quadrille prevented any couple who had not danced so much , and at those times contrived to conciliate five or six instead of only one . Emmeline took charge of the younger children , often refusing to dance with older boys , who would have made her much pleasanter partners , that she might join the little quadrille and set them all right . "
88472	88517	88470	88470	herself	113	" said Mrs. Greville , addressing Mrs. Hamilton , who was standing rather apart at the moment , watching Caroline with such mingled feelings of pride and dread , that she was quite glad when her friend 's voice disturbed her train of thought . "
88559	88560	88563	88563	she	113	" "
88566	88573	88563	88563	she	113	" inquired Mrs. Hamilton , anxiously . "
88604	88605	88591	88591	I	0	" "
88614	88623	88606	88606	You	0	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , with real relief ; "
88707	88708	88702	88702	Ellen	113	" "
88745	88746	88748	88748	you	0	" "
88774	88790	88791	88791	He	162	" said Mr. Hamilton joining them , with the young clergyman leaning on his arm . "
88816	88817	88791	88791	He	162	" "
88837	88842	88791	88791	He	162	" rejoined Mrs. Greville . "
88927	88928	88930	88930	you	0	" "
88940	88954	88930	88930	you	0	" He answered in the affirmative , but Mr. Hamilton shook his head . "
88964	88968	88955	88955	I	0	" he said . "
89135	89136	89137	89137	You	162	" "
89142	89146	89137	89137	You	162	" replied Morton ; "
89172	89173	89149	89149	you	162	" "
89333	89404	89317	89318	Miss Grahame	145	" They adjourned to the music - room , where Percy had already gallantly conducted Annie , and several of the guests , young and old , seconded the move : Annie Grahame really played remarkably well , so far as execution and brilliancy were concerned , and Mrs. Hamilton was delighted at the expression of Grahame 's face as he listened to his child and the applause she excited . "
89417	89421	89407	89407	he	1660	" she thought , "
89447	89536	89537	89537	You	1661	" was the thought that followed at the contrast which Lady Helen 's face presented to her husband 's ; she knew Annie played well , she had heard it from very superior judges , and how could it concern her what the present company thought ? A very pretty vocal duet from the two sisters followed , and soon afterward Caroline approached the music - stand , near which Percy and Mr. Morton were talking , and Percy , with his usual love of provoking , exclaimed — "
89581	89594	89595	89595	Mamma	80	" Caroline 's cheek burned , but she answered , with spirit — "
89622	89623	89606	89606	she	80	" "
89633	89656	89630	89631	Miss Hamilton	182	" interposed Mr. Morton , taking the music from her , and offering her his arm to lead her to the piano . "
89693	89694	89697	89697	you	1661	" "
89711	89712	89702	89703	Mr. Morton	162	" "
89754	89932	89746	89746	she	3503	" Caroline was seated at the instrument as he spoke , and there was something in his few words touching a right chord ; for as she began to play she certainly thought more of her mother than any one else ; and determined , if possible , that others should think with Mr. Morton , forgetting at the moment that very few , except their own immediate circle , knew whose pupil she was , not imagining that the mistress of Oakwood and its large possessions could have time or inclination for any part of the education of her daughters . Morton was certainly right as to the amount of admiration , equaling , if not surpassing , that bestowed on Miss Grahame ; there was a soul , a depth of expression and feeling , in Caroline 's far simpler piece , that won its way to the heart at once , and if it did not surprise as much , it pleased more , and excited an earnest wish to listen to her again . "
89940	89953	89959	89959	her	1671	" inquired a lady , who had been much attracted with Emmeline . "
89962	89967	89968	89968	she	1671	" replied Mrs. Hamilton ; "
89991	89992	89968	89968	she	1671	" "
90012	90025	89994	89994	you	1670	" asked another rather stern - looking lady , with much surprise . "
90067	90068	90071	90071	you	1670	" "
90091	90092	90095	90095	I	0	" "
90098	90105	90095	90095	I	0	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , earnestly . "
90238	90239	90278	90278	Your	1670	" "
90252	90258	90247	90250	either of your daughters	1678	" inquired the first speaker . "
90276	90277	90247	90250	either of your daughters	1678	" "
90283	90289	90278	90278	Your	1670	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , smiling "
90330	90331	90326	90326	she	78	" "
90339	90340	90350	90350	she	78	" "
90383	90397	90373	90373	I	0	" she added , as Herbert approached , and eagerly whispered some request . "
90426	90427	90422	90422	mine	0	" "
90450	90998	90999	90999	I	0	" and a few minutes afterward Mrs. Hamilton led the blushing , timid girl in triumph to the piano . Her voice , which was peculiarly sweet and thrilling , though not strong , trembled audibly as she commenced ; but Herbert was turning over the leaves of her music , his mother was standing close beside her , and after the first few bars her enthusiastic spirit forgot the presence of all , save those she loved , and the spirit of her song . Mrs. Hamilton never listened to and looked at her at such moments without a trembling foreboding she vainly struggled to overcome . There was something in those deep blue , earnest eyes , the hectic color that with the least exertion rose to her cheek , the transparency of complexion , the warm and elevated spirit , the almost angel temper and endurance in her peculiarly tried lot , that scarcely seemed of earth ; and never was that sad foreboding stronger than at that moment , as she looked round the crowd of young and happy faces , and none seemed to express the same as Mary 's . She could scarcely command her voice and smile sufficiently to warmly thank her young favorite as she ceased ; but Mary was more than satisfied by the fond pressure of her hand . This little interruption to the actual business of the evening only increased the zest and enjoyment , when dancing recommenced . Even the call to supper was obeyed with reluctance , and speedily accomplished , that they might return the sooner to the ball - room . The hours had worn away , it seemed , on gossamer - wings , and as each happy child felt assured that the delight could not last much longer , the longing to dance to the very last moment seemed to increase . Emmeline 's excitable spirit had thrown off all alloy , for it was quite impossible any one would think of asking her to play now ; she had arranged all the remaining couples — for the room had begun very much to thin — for the favorite haymaker 's country dance,[2 ] and accepting Edward as her own partner , and being unanimously desired to take the top , led off her young friends with such spirit and grace , and so little semblance of fatigue , that it certainly appeared as if she would verify her own words , and dance all night . Miss Grahame had declared it was much too great a romp , and declined joining it . Caroline , who would have enjoyed it , more out of politeness to her friend than inclination , sat down with her , and a cheerful group of some of the older lads , and one or two young ladies , joined them . Herbert and Mary finding the quadrille for which they were engaged , changed to a dance for which , though they had quite the spirit , they had not the physical strength , enjoyed a quiet chat instead , and Ellen seated herself by her favorite Mary , declining , from fatigue , Alfred Greville 's entreaty that she would second Emmeline . "
91010	91034	91006	91008	that merry group	1685	" exclaimed Mr. Grahame , after watching them some time , and all his austerity banished by the kindly spirit of the evening . "
91055	91075	91044	91044	you	1686	" Both ladies laughingly begged to be excused , offering , however , to introduce him to a partner . "
91153	91154	91143	91143	Percy	99	" "
91159	91190	91156	91156	I	0	" answered Percy , who had waltzed his partner very cleverly out of the line , and , after giving her a seat , threw himself on a large ottoman . "
91252	91403	91404	91404	I	0	" The gravity with which he spoke caused a general laugh ; but Mrs. Hamilton , feeling by the length of time the fatiguing dance had lasted , there was really some truth in his words , desired the musicians to stop ; causing an exclamation of regret and disappointment from many youthful lips , and Emmeline and Edward ran up to her , to entreat that they might go on little longer . Mrs. Hamilton , however , refused ; and Edward yielded directly , but Emmeline was so much excited , that obedience was most unusually difficult ; and when her mother desired her to sit down quietly for ten minutes , and then come to the music - room , as Mrs. Allan most particularly wished to hear her play before she left , she answered , with more petulance than she was at all aware of — "
91422	91423	91424	91424	Emmeline	78	" "
91426	91435	91424	91424	Emmeline	78	" exclaimed her mother , adding , gravely , "
91450	91506	91439	91439	you	78	" The tone , still more than the words , was enough ; poor Emmeline was just in that mood when tears are quite as near as smiles ; her own petulance seemed to reproach her too , and she suddenly burst into tears . Many exclamations of sympathy and condolence burst from her mother 's friends:—"Poor
91509	91510	91511	91511	She	78	" "
91518	91519	91511	91511	She	78	" "
91527	91577	91511	91511	She	78	now!"—but Mrs. Greville saying , with a smile , that her little friend 's tears were always the very lightest April showers , successfully turned the attention of many from her ; while Mrs. Hamilton taking her hand from her face , merely said , in a low voice — "
91601	91643	91594	91594	he	1694	" Her little girl 's only answer was to bury her face still more closely in her mother 's dress , very much as if she would like to hide herself entirely ; but on Mrs. Allan saying , very kindly — "
91689	91741	91673	91673	I	0	" She raised her head directly , shook back the fair ringlets that had fallen over her face , and though the tears were still on her cheeks and filling her eyes , she said , with a blending of childish shyness and yet courageous truth , impossible to be described — "
91803	91804	91793	91793	she	3420	" "
91812	91905	91793	91793	she	3420	" was Mrs. Hamilton 's only notice of a reply that actually made her heart throb with thankfulness , that her lessons of truth were so fully understood and practiced by one naturally so gentle and timid as her Emmeline : while Mrs. Allan knew not what to answer , from a feeling of involuntary respect . It would have been so easy to escape a disagreeable task by tacitly allowing that she was too tired to play ; and what careful training must it have been to have so taught truth . "
91945	92189	91938	91938	your	78	" Emmeline looked timidly up in her mother 's face to be quite sure that her displeasure had subsided , as her words seemed to denote ; and quite satisfied , her tears were all checked , and taking Mrs. Allan 's offered hand , she went directly to the music - room . Mrs. Hamilton lingered to desire Herbert ( who had come up to know the cause of his sister 's sudden tears ) to form the last quadrille , and reserve a place , if he possibly could , for Emmeline , as they would not begin till she had done . Her little girl was playing as she rejoined her , and it really was a pretty picture , her fairy figure with her tiny harp , and her sweet face seeming to express the real feeling with which she played . There was no execution in the simple Highland air , but her vivid imagination lent it a meaning , and so , when fairly playing , she did not mind it . Mrs. Allan had lost a little girl just at Emmeline 's age , who had also played the harp , and there was something in her caress and thanks , after she had done , that made Emmeline stand quietly at her side , without heeding the praises that were lavished round her . Herbert at that moment appeared with one of the young Allans . "
92220	92221	92214	92214	he	187	" "
92226	92296	92214	92214	he	187	" added Mrs. Allan , as her son gayly pleaded his own cause ; Emmeline only waited to read her mother 's consent in her eyes , for she thought that she ought not to dance any more ; and in another minute the joyous music had resounded , and she was dancing and chatting as gayly and happily as if there had been no interruption to her joy . "
92315	92361	92308	92313	a man - of - war	3569	" asked Mr. Grahame , jestingly of Edward while waiting for his wife and daughters , who were the last departures ( much to Annie 's horror , for it was so unfashionable to be quite the last ) , to be cloaked and shawled . "
92364	92371	92308	92313	a man - of - war	3569	" was his very indignant reply , "
92456	92457	92460	92460	him	1708	" "
92464	92471	92462	92462	Hamilton	78	" exclaimed Grahame , laughing heartily ; "
92508	92509	92510	92510	I	0	" "
92517	92523	92510	92510	I	0	" answered Edward , earnestly ; "
92564	92565	92548	92548	I	0	" "
92580	92581	92582	92582	I	0	" "
92591	92592	92582	92582	I	0	" "
92611	92612	92582	92582	I	0	" "
92616	92633	92582	92582	I	0	" replied Edward , laughing ; adding , as he put his arm affectionately round Ellen , "
92661	92662	92642	92642	she	1719	" "
92691	93423	92682	92682	I	0	" Grahame said , as he laid his hand kindly on Ellen 's head , and then turned to obey the summons of his wife . The young party , no doubt , felt that it would be infinitely more agreeable to sit up all night , and talk of the only too quickly concluded enjoyment , than to retire to their respective pillows ; but the habits of Oakwood were somewhat too well regulated for such dissipation , though , no doubt , their dream - land that night , was peopled with the pleasant shadows of reality , and , according to their respective sources of enjoyment , brought back their evening 's happiness again and again . The return to the quiet routine of work , and less exciting recreation after the Christmas pleasures , was of course a trial to all our young friends . Not so much to the boys , as to their sisters ; Percy 's elastic spirits found pleasure in every thing , being somewhat too old to care for his studies , or feel them now as a restraint . Herbert only exchanged one kind of happiness for another . Edward looked to every month that passed , as bringing nearer the attainment of his wishes ; and he was so fond of Mr. Howard , and so quick at learning , and such a favorite with all his schoolfellows , that he did not care at all when the time of work came again . Ellen and Emmeline both found it very difficult to like their lessons again ; especially the latter , who felt as if work and regularity were most particularly disagreeable things , and sometimes was almost in despair as to her ever enjoying them again ; but she tried very hard to overcome indolence , and never give way to petulance , and succeeded , so as to win her the delight of both her parents ' approbation . Indulgence always made her feel as if no effort on her part was too great to prove how much she felt it ; and when any one , old or young , experiences this sort of feeling , they need never be afraid but that they will succeed in their efforts , painful and hard as they may at first seem . It was not so difficult for Ellen as for Emmeline , because she was less able to realize such an intensity of pleasure . She seemed safer when regularly employed ; and besides , to work hard at her respective studies , was one of the very few things which she could do to prove how much she loved her aunt ; and accustomed from such early childhood to conquer inclination , and , in fact , never to fancy pleasure and indulgence were her due , there was happiness enough for her even in their more regular life : but to Caroline the change was actually unbearable . While admiration and praise only incited Emmeline to greater exertions , they caused Caroline completely to relax in hers , and to give , in consequence , as much trouble and annoyance as she had received pleasure . The perseverance in her various studies , especially in music , the unceasing control over her temper , which before the holidays she had so striven for , had now entirely given way . It was much less trouble for her to learn than Emmeline , therefore her studies with Miss Harcourt were generally well performed ; but the admiration she had excited made her long for more , and believe herself a person deserving much more consideration and respect than she received from her own family . These thoughts persisted in , of course , produced and retained ill - temper ; which , as there was no longer any fear of her being debarred by its indulgence from any pleasure , she made no attempt to overcome . The praise bestowed on her music , made her fancy herself a much greater proficient than she really was , and though her love of music was great , her love of praise was greater ; and so she not only relaxed in her practice , but inwardly murmured at the very little praise she received from her mother . "
93445	93509	93436	93436	you	1722	" Herbert exclaimed , one day , when an attack of weakness , to which he was liable , had confined him to a sofa . Mrs. Hamilton , after giving her usual hour 's lesson , in which Caroline had chosen to do nothing , had left her in very evident displeasure , and even Herbert was roused to most unusual indignation . "
93520	93526	93436	93436	you	1722	" was her angry reply ; "
93541	93542	93543	93543	You	1722	" "
93554	93555	93543	93543	You	1722	" "
93567	93568	93543	93543	You	1722	" "
93614	93615	93598	93598	you	1722	" "
93634	93635	93598	93598	you	1722	" "
93676	93677	93663	93664	strangers worth	1727	" "
93690	93696	93663	93664	strangers worth	1727	" was the cold reply . "
93759	93760	93761	93761	You	102	" "
93786	93997	93773	93773	I	0	" interrupted Caroline , and she left the room in anger . A faint flush rose to the pale cheek of her brother , but he quickly conquered the natural irritation , and sought his mother , by every fond attention on his part , to remove the pain of Caroline 's conduct . This continued for about a fortnight , at the end of which time , Caroline suddenly resumed her music with assiduity , and there were no more ebullitions of ill - temper . Herbert hoped his expostulations were taking effect ; Mrs. Hamilton trusted that her child was becoming sensible of her past folly , and trying to conquer it , and banish its memory herself : both , however , were mistaken . Annie Grahame had imparted to her friend , in strict confidence , that her mother intended giving a grand ball about the end of February , and meant to entreat Mrs. Hamilton , as a personal favor , to let Caroline be present . Caroline little knew the very slight foundation Annie had for this assertion . Lady Helen had merely said , perhaps she would ask ; and this was only said , because she was too indolent and weak to say "
93999	94186	94187	94187	Caroline	120	" at once . Not that she had any unkind feeling toward Caroline , but simply because she was perfectly certain Mrs. Hamilton would not consent , and to persuade as earnestly as Annie wished was really too much trouble . Caroline 's wishes in this instance triumphed over her better judgment , for had she allowed herself to think soberly , she ought to have known her mother 's principles of action sufficiently , not to entertain the slightest hope of going . The invitations ( three weeks ' notice ) for her parents and brothers came . In them she did not expect to be included , but when above a week passed , and still not a word was said , disappointment took the place of hope , and it was only the still lingering belief that she might go , even at the last moment , that prevented the return of ill - temper . Now Lady Helen really had asked , though she did not persuade ; and Mrs. Hamilton thanked her , but , as she expected , decidedly refused . "
94193	94197	94187	94187	Caroline	120	" she said , "
94212	94527	94204	94204	she	120	" Lady Helen said , with truth , that she had not mentioned the subject to her , and had desired Annie to be equally silent . Mrs. Hamilton quite forgot that Miss Grahame was not famous for obedience , and , relying on her friend 's assurance , determined on not saying any thing to Caroline about it ; wishing to spare her the pain which she knew her refusal would inflict . As it happened , it would have been better if she had spoken . The weather had prevented Caroline from seeing Annie , but she was quite sure she would not deceive her ; and her proud heart rebelled against her mother , not only for refusing Lady Helen 's request , but for treating her so much like a child , as to hide that refusal from her . Under the influence of such thoughts , of course , her temper became more and more difficult to control and as a natural consequence , anger and irritation against her mother , and self - reproach for the indulgence of such feelings increased , till she became actually miserable . It happened that about this time Miss Harcourt left Oakwood for a week on a visit to an invalid friend at Dartmouth . Mrs. Hamilton had given her full liberty , promising that her pupils should lose nothing by her absence . She left on the Saturday , and the Thursday was Lady Helen 's ball . On the Monday , Mr. Hamilton , detained Edward as he was leaving the library , after morning prayers , and told him that he had received a letter , which he thought might chance to interest him . Ten minutes afterward , Edward rushed into the breakfast - room , in a state of such joyous excitement that he could scarcely speak . "
94538	94558	94204	94204	she	120	" he exclaimed , springing from chair to chair , as if velocity of movement should bring back speech . "
94633	94634	94590	94590	uncle	3425	" "
94648	94654	94655	94655	I	0	" interposed Percy laughing heartily . "
94727	94728	94729	94729	I	0	" "
94760	94761	94754	94754	I	0	" "
94768	94773	94763	94763	I	0	" eagerly interrupted Emmeline ; "
94827	94828	94816	94816	You	76	" "
94891	95503	94884	94884	I	0	" Mrs. Hamilton could not speak at the first moment , for the joy , the animation of her nephew so recalled the day when her own much - loved brother , her darling Charles , had rushed into her room , to tell her all his glee , for no one ever listened to and shared in his joys and troubles as she did . He was then scarcely older than Edward , as full of hope and joy and buoyancy — where was he ? Would his fate be that of the bright , beautiful boy before her ? And as Edward threw his arms round her neck , and kissed her again and again , telling her he could not be quite sure it was not all a dream , unless she wished him joy too it was the utmost effort to prevent the fast gathering tears , and so command her voice , that he should not hear her tremble . Poor Ellen looked and felt bewildered . She had always tried to realize that Edward , to be a sailor , must leave her ; and in fact aware that his summons would soon come , her aunt and uncle had often alluded to his departure before her , but still she had never thought it near ; and now the news was so sudden , and Edward was so wild with joy she fancied she ought to rejoice too , but she could not ; and Percy was obliged to ask her merrily , what ailed her , and if she could not trust to his being a much more worthy brother than such a water - rat , who had no business whatever on land , before she could take her place at the breakfast table and try to smile . But her eyes would rest on Edward even then , and she felt as if there were something across her throat and she could not swallow the nice roll which Herbert , had so kindly buttered and cut , and so quietly placed in her plate ; and when Edward said something very funny , as he was in the habit of doing , and made them all laugh , she tried to laugh too , but instead of a laugh it was a sob that startled herself , for she was quite sure she did not mean to be so foolish : but instead of being reproved , as she was afraid she should be , she felt her aunt 's arm thrown gently round her , till she could hide her face on her shoulder , and cry quite quietly for a few minutes , for they went on talking and laughing round the breakfast - table , and nobody took any notice of her , which she was quite glad of , for she could not bear Edward to think she was unhappy when he was so pleased . And after breakfast , though he was in such a desperate hurry to tell Mr. Howard the good news , that when he did set off , he left even Percy far behind him , he found time to give her a hearty kiss , and to tell her that he loved her very much , though he could not help being so glad he was going to sea ; and that he was quite proud of her , because though he knew she was very sorry he was going , she did not cry and make a fuss as some selfish people would ; and then she really did smile . "
95529	95551	95517	95517	Morris	134	" Mrs. Hamilton said , as she entered the school - room , and found the three girls preparing their books , "
95645	96219	96220	96220	I	0	" Such an anticipation was quite enough for Emmeline . Her dance about the room was only checked by the idea that her lessons would never be ready , nor her exercises and sums done , unless she sat quietly down , and so , with a great effort , she gave all her attention to her various tasks , and mastered them even before her mother returned . Ellen , though she tried quite as much , was not so successful . The Prince William would sail in miniature on her slate , over all her figures . The recollection of the awful storm they had encountered on their voyage to England would return so vividly , that the very room seemed to heave . And then — but she could not make out why she should think about that then — her mother 's death - bed came before her and her promise , and it seemed harder still to part with Edward , from a vague dread that came over her , but still she tried to attend to what she had to do , and congratulated herself on its completion before her aunt appeared . Caroline , alone , was determined not to work . Because she had not made herself miserable enough already , the most unfounded jealousy entered her head from seeing her mother 's caressing kindness toward Ellen at breakfast ; why was not her manner as kind to her ! She was quite as unhappy , and her mother must see it , but she took no notice of her — only of Ellen . She might be cross sometimes , but she never told stories or tried to hide her faults , and it was very hard and unjust that she should be treated so like a child , and Ellen made so much of ; and so she thought and thought , not attempting to do a single thing till she actually made herself believe , for the time , that her kind , indulgent mother had no love for her ; and every thing looked blacker than before . She made no effort to rouse herself even in Mrs. Hamilton 's presence , but listened to her remonstrances with such extreme carelessness , almost insolence , that her mother felt her patience failing . The self - control , however , for which she had successfully striven , enabled her so to overcome the irritation , as to retain her own quiet dignity , and simply to desire Caroline to give her attention at once to her studies , and conquer her ill - temper , or not to think of accompanying them on their excursion , as idleness and peevishness were better left to themselves . An insolent and haughty reply rose to Caroline 's lips ; but with an effort she remained silent , her flushed forehead alone denoting the internal agitation . Emmeline 's diligence and the approbation she received irritated her still more ; but she rejoiced when she heard her mother tell Ellen there was not a correct line in her French exercise , and her sum , a compound long division , wrong from the very first figure . But the pleasure soon gave place to indignant anger , when , instead of the reproof which she believed would follow , Mrs. Hamilton said very kindly — "
96302	96421	96423	96423	I	0	" Ellen obeyed directly ; a little care , and with the assistance of her grammar , which her aunt permitted her to refer to , instead of depending entirely on her memory that morning , enabled her to succeed with her French ; but four times was that tormenting sum returned to , till at last her tears effaced the figures as fast as they were written . Still , patience and resolution in both teacher and pupil conquered , and the fifth time there was not a figure wrong ; and Mrs. Hamilton , fondly putting back the heavy ringlets which in Ellen 's absorbed attention had fallen over her tearful cheeks , said , playfully — "
96582	96872	96546	96546	I	0	" Ellen was so glad , that she felt almost happy , and her few other duties were done quite briskly , for Mrs. Hamilton had been so kind as to countermand the carriage till one , that she and Caroline might have time to finish . But Caroline , if she had not tried before , was now still less capable of doing so . Every word of kindness addressed to Ellen increased the storm raging within , and the difficulty of restraining it in Mrs. Hamilton 's presence caused it to burst forth with unmitigated violence the moment she quitted the apartment , desiring Emmeline and Ellen to make haste , and put away their books , but still without taking the least notice of her . Invective , reproach , almost abuse , were poured against Ellen , who stood actually frightened at the violence she had so very innocently excited , and at the fearful and deforming passion which inflamed her cousin 's every feature . Caroline 's anger had miscounted time , or she must have known that her mother could not have gone far enough , for such unusual tones of excitement to escape her quick hearing . Mrs. Hamilton , startled and alarmed , returned directly , and so vividly did her child 's appearance and words recall her own misguided sister in those uncontrolled fits of fury , under which she had so often trembled , that present disappointment and dread for the future , took possession of her , and for the moment rendered her powerless . Caroline was too much engrossed to perceive her at first , and she had , therefore time to rally from the momentary weakness . "
96878	96920	96546	96546	I	0	" she exclaimed , fixing her eyes on Caroline , with that expression of quiet but stern reproof , which when she did use it — and it was very seldom — had the power of subduing even the wildest excitement . "
97024	97025	97026	97026	I	0	" "
97031	97049	97050	97050	I	0	" answered Caroline , bursting into violent tears , and scarcely aware of what she was saying , "
97162	97163	97151	97151	she	113	" "
97176	97239	97151	97151	she	113	" Mrs. Hamilton said , as she calmly turned for a moment to Emmeline and Ellen , who both stood bewildered , the former from actual terror that her sister should dare so to address her mother , and the latter from pain at the violent avowal of a dislike which she had intuitively felt , but had always tried to disbelieve . "
97306	97405	97282	97282	she	1763	" Emmeline longed to throw her arms round her mother , and with tears beseech her to forget what Caroline had said ; but , though Mrs. Hamilton had spoken cheerfully , and in quite her usual tone of voice to them , there was something in her countenance , that checked any display of softness even in her affectionate child ; something that almost awed her , and she left the room with Ellen to prepare for the promised excursion , which had , however , lost all its anticipated enjoyment from the uncontrolled temper of another . "
97415	97443	97410	97410	I	0	" said Mrs. Hamilton , as soon as they were alone , and again regarding Caroline , who was sobbing violently , with that same searching look . "
97613	97920	97595	97595	You	120	" She left the room , and in a very short time afterward Caroline heard the carriage drive off ; but for nearly three long hours she never moved from her seat , so utterly miserable , as scarcely even to change her position . Never in her life before , not in her most angry moments , had she so spoken to her mother , and her remorse was almost intolerable . Again and again she remembered what Mrs. Hamilton had told her so often , that , if she did not strive and pray against the dominion of ill - temper while young , it would become more and more uncontrollable , and the older she became , the more difficult to subdue , even in a moderate degree ; and her words were indeed true . It had been many months since temper had gained such an ascendency , and its effects were far , far more violent , and its power over her more determined , and if , as she grew older , it should be still worse , what would become of her ? how insufferably wretched ? what would she not have given to have recalled her words ? The jealousy which had arisen , now she knew not how , had sunk into air before those few calm inquiring sentences from her mother , and in her excessive misery every kind deed and word and look , every fond indulgence and forbearance , in fact , all the love her mother had so lavished on her from her infancy , rushed back upon her , till she actually hated herself , and longed the more intensely for the comfort of that soothing affection , which , in real pain or childish sorrow , had never been refused her . "
97935	97972	97925	97925	Annie	129	" she exclaimed , at length , as the sound of many joyous voices and the dressing - bell proclaimed the return of the various members of her family only in time to prepare for dinner . "
98060	98100	98106	98106	mamma	80	" she added , as on rising to go to her own room , she caught sight of her own face in a mirror , and actually started at the disfigurement which the violence of her emotion had wrought . "
98135	98706	98707	98707	You	1768	" From every eye but her mother 's she could and did hide herself ; for saying that her head ached , which was the truth , and she did not wish any thing to take , she refused to go down to dinner . Mrs. Hamilton had successfully exerted herself during their excursion , and Emmeline and Ellen enjoyed themselves so thoroughly as almost to forget the alloy of the morning ; and even when Caroline 's message recalled it , the boys were all so merry , that it did not disturb them . Percy always declared that Caroline 's headache was only another term for temper - ache , and he would certainly have sent her some message of mock pity , if his quick eye had not discovered or fancied that his mother did not look quite as well as usual , and so he contented himself by trying still more to be the life of the dinner - table . Mr. Hamilton had seen at a single glance that all was not quite right , and Caroline 's non - appearance and message explained it , to his extreme regret , for he had begun to hope and believe that his wife 's extreme solicitude , on her account , was beginning to decrease . Mrs. Hamilton had not much doubt that silence and solitude had so far had effect on Caroline as to subdue passion , and bring her to a sense of her misconduct ; but that had scarcely power to lessen the anxiety and the pain which Caroline 's words had so wantonly inflicted . Had she indeed evinced any thing like undue partiality ? the idea alone almost brought a smile ; fondly , and almost as her own child , as she loved her little niece . The very anxiety Caroline occasioned her , deepened her affection ; the very control she was obliged to exercise in her mode of guiding her , strengthened every feeling toward her . She was so enwrapped in these painfully engrossing thoughts , in the strict examination of her own own heart , that she was not aware the time she had appointed had passed by full ten minutes , till she was roused by the handle of her door being softly turned , and left again , as if some one had wished to enter , but hesitated . The very hesitation gave her hope , for she really did not know that the utmost penalty she could have inflicted on Caroline , in the moment of natural indignation , would have failed in producing such an effect as the simple command to seek her , and define her charges against her , when that angry excitement had so calmed , that Caroline would have given worlds , if she might but have not referred to it again . She knew she dared not disobey , but her daring had left her so powerless that she had stood at her mother 's door full ten minutes before she could command courage sufficient to open it and enter . Mrs. Hamilton looked at her changed aspect , the bitter humiliation expressed in every feature , with such pity , that it required even more than her usual exercise of control , to retain the grave , and apparently unmoved tone with which she said — "
98755	98816	98817	98817	I	0	" Caroline gladly obeyed , by sitting down on a low ottoman , some little distance from her mother , on whose neck she absolutely longed to throw herself and beseech forgiveness ; but Mrs. Hamilton 's tone was not such as to give her courage to do so . She remained silent , burying her face in her hands . "
98849	98850	98845	98845	you	1768	" "
98913	98914	98917	98917	Caroline	120	" "
99148	99219	99223	99223	Caroline	120	" Caroline tried to speak , but she could only sob forth , that she could not recall one instance , in which her mother had been more displeased with her than her conduct merited . Acknowledging , but almost inarticulately , that she had sometimes fancied that she had remained longer cold with her than with Ellen , after the committal of a fault — and that—(she stopped ) . "
99225	99226	99223	99223	Caroline	120	" "
99240	99241	99237	99237	Ellen	113	" "
99363	99364	99365	99365	I	0	" "
99372	99379	99365	99365	I	0	" exclaimed Caroline with returning temper . "
99446	99561	99436	99436	you	120	" Caroline turned from that penetrating look and burst into tears . Few as the words were , they seemed to flash light into the very inmost recesses of her heart , and tell her that in moments of uncontrolled temper , in her brooding fancies , she really did forfeit the truth , on adherence to which she so prided herself ; and that there was no excuse for her in the idea that she did not know what she said or did — for why had religion and reason been so carefully implanted within her , but to enable her to subdue the evil temper , ere it acquired such fearful dominion . "
99573	99587	99563	99563	you	120	" resumed Mrs. Hamilton , and her tone was not quite so cold ; "
99714	99781	99695	99695	you	120	" For one minute Caroline hesitated , but then resolved she would atone for her fault at least by a full confession . She told all the wishes , the hopes Annie 's information of Lady Helen 's promise had imparted , and the pain it was to feel that her mother thought her such a child as not to speak to her on the subject . "
100065	100113	100114	100114	Mamma	80	" Caroline looked hastily up ; her mother 's tone was almost as fond as usual , and , unable to restrain the impulse any longer , she started from her low seat , and kneeling down close by her , clung round her , passionately exclaiming — "
100165	100166	100167	100167	I	0	" "
100182	100198	100167	100167	I	0	" replied her mother , not refusing the kiss Caroline 's eyes so earnestly besought . "
100324	100325	100327	100327	I	0	" "
100335	100351	100327	100327	I	0	" answered Caroline , whose violent excitement had given way to tears of real repentance ; "
100424	100425	100420	100420	I	0	" "
100518	100519	100520	100520	I	0	" "
100637	100697	100699	100699	you	3420	" Mrs. Hamilton involuntarily drew her child more closely to her . The humility , the bitterness of self - reproach , was so unlike Caroline 's usual haughtiness — so very much deeper than they had ever been before , that she hoped , in spite of her anxiety , and her voice audibly trembled as she answered — "
100864	100935	100938	100938	mamma	3420	" Caroline could not reply , for every kind word her mother spoke , seemed to heighten self - reproach , and make her still more wretched . Mrs. Hamilton felt that there was no refusal in her silence , and continued talking to her in that same gentle strain a little while longer , and then rose to leave her — but Caroline looked so sorrowful that she hesitated . "
100966	100998	100945	100945	you	3420	" she said , though the tears started again to her eyes , for she felt as if it would be an indescribable comfort still to be alone with her mother . "
101016	101024	101025	101025	I	0	" Mrs. Hamilton answered in the affirmative . "
101067	101068	101061	101061	myself	0	" "
101344	101544	101334	101334	you	3420	" She embraced and left her — to meditations , from whose bitter , though salutary pain , Caroline made no attempt to escape ; though , had it not been for her mother 's advice , she would gladly have flown to her studies , and worked with double assiduity , believing that she was , by doing so , atoning for her fault , instead of merely shrinking from its remembrance . It was a trial to join her family even for prayers ; for she felt so self - convicted , so humbled , that she fancied every one must despise her ; and when , after the service , Percy approached , and , with mock sympathy , inquired how her headache was , and if she had recovered her appetite , and begged her not to be ill at such a critical time , as he most particularly wished to go to Lady Helen 's ball , and he could not be so cruel , if she were not well , her spirit was so broken that the large tears rolled down her cheeks , and she turned away without uttering a single word . "
101569	101621	101561	101561	you	1799	" said Mrs. Hamilton , more hastily than she was in the habit of interfering ; and as Caroline came to her , she whispered some few fond words , that enabled her to wish her father good - night and leave the room , without any farther display of emotion . "
101633	101646	101623	101623	you	1799	" she said gently detaining him , as he was following Caroline . "
101660	101661	101656	101656	you	0	" "
101707	101708	101709	101709	I	0	" "
101738	101739	101729	101729	I	0	" "
101815	101816	101808	101808	you	1799	" "
101857	102302	102303	102303	You	1809	" he laughingly answered , looking up in her face so archly and yet so fondly , that his mother could not help smiling ; promising she would not sentence him to any thing so terrible as not to tease for a whole year , as she was quite sure he would fall into his old propensities before a quarter of the time had expired . Lady Helen 's ball took place ; and Caroline had so conquered herself , that she could listen to Percy 's flowing account of its delights with actual cheerfulness . It was so associated with self - reproach , that she could scarcely think of it without pain ; but she was so convinced of her folly in permitting such a very little thing so to affect her temper as to cause all the misery she had endured , that she had resolved to punish herself , not only by listening to Percy , but by herself inquiring the details . She was a girl of really a strong mind , and once convinced of error , once released from the fell dominion of temper , she did not care what pain she endured , or what difficulty she encountered , so that she could but convince her mother how truly she regretted , and tried to atone for past misconduct . It was very easy , as Mrs. Hamilton had told her , to regain lost time in her studies , but not quite so easy to check the cross word or unkind thought , and to break from the black cloud that still at times would envelop her . But she did not give way , constantly even making opportunities for self - denial , and doing little kindnesses for Ellen , though she was too truthful to profess an affection which as yet she could not feel . Early in the following week Mr. Grahame came over to Oakwood with a petition . Annie having taken cold at the party , had been obliged to enact the invalid , much against her inclination , and so entreated her mother to invite Caroline to spend a few days with her ; and to her astonishment , her cold , harsh father volunteered to go himself for her . Mr. Hamilton at once acceded ; his wife hesitated ; but she went at once to Caroline , who chanced to be reading alone in the school - room , for it was the time of recreation , and told her . For a moment her countenance was actually radiant with delight , the next it clouded over . "
102332	102340	102327	102327	your	1809	" asked her mother , half smiling . "
102372	102373	102352	102352	I	0	" "
102382	102383	102352	102352	I	0	" "
102410	102411	102413	102413	you	1809	" "
102432	102433	102436	102436	mamma	3420	" "
102462	102463	102465	102465	I	0	" "
102506	102507	102489	102490	Lady Helen	127	" "
102518	102525	102510	102510	mamma	3420	" interrupted Caroline , very eagerly . "
102601	102602	102591	102591	I	0	" "
102740	102741	102742	102742	I	0	" "
102763	102776	102748	102748	you	1809	" answered Caroline , in a very earnest and somewhat lowered voice . "
102868	102869	102842	102842	you	1809	" "
103034	103068	103008	103008	I	0	" With the most delighted alacrity Caroline hastened to get ready , and in her hurry forgot the poem till she re - entered the school - room , which was still untenanted . "
103079	103083	103008	103008	I	0	" she thought ; "
103143	103526	103539	103539	Ellen	113	" And she hastily tore out a page from an exercise - book which lay open on the table ; not perceiving that by doing so , a fellow - leaf , which was written on , was loosened , and fell to the ground , mingling with some torn papers which had been put in a heap to be cleared away . She had just finished it , when Fanny came to tell her Mr. Grahame could not wait any longer , and asking if all the papers on the ground were to be removed , Caroline hastily answered in the affirmative , without looking at them , and the girl bore them off in her apron , the written leaf among them . Now it so happened that this written leaf had already occasioned trouble . Miss Harcourt had been so displeased with Ellen 's careless performance of a French exercise that morning , that she had desired her to write it again . It was very difficult , and had materially shortened the time which she had promised to devote to Edward , who was this week released from his attendance on Mr. Howard , to permit him and Ellen to be as much together as possible . Hurried by him , she left her book open on the table to dry , and , finding it closed on her return , put it away , without looking at it . The following day Miss Harcourt , of course , requested to see it , and , to Ellen 's utter astonishment , her exercise was not there ; only the faulty and blotted theme , with no sign to explain its disappearance . Now we know Miss Harcourt was rather prejudiced against Ellen , and , as she had unhappily failed in truth more than once ( perhaps she was not so unjust and harsh as poor Ellen felt her to be ) , she refused to believe her assurance that she had written it . No one had been in the school - room at the time to whom she could refer : if Ellen had never disobeyed or deceived , of course her word would be sufficient , as her brother 's and cousins ' would . "
103678	103812	103819	103819	you	1824	" Poor Ellen felt too bewildered and too miserable even to cry . That she had written her exercise , she was as positive as that she had been told to do so ; but if she had — what had become of it ? Harsh as Miss Harcourt seemed , appearances were certainly very much against her . She had not a single proof that she had obeyed , and her word was nothing ; even Emmeline looked at her doubtingly , and as if she could scarcely even pity her . It was very little comfort to think her aunt was not to be told . Her own impulse was to go to her , and tell her at once ; but how could she be believed ? and Mrs. Hamilton 's words—"If
103837	104685	103819	103819	you	1824	" the remembrance of all she had suffered , the disappointment it would be to her aunt to think all she had said and read to her were forgotten , when in reality she was constantly thinking of and trying to act on them , all checked the impulse , and terrified her into silence . Miss Harcourt was not an acute physiognomist ; she could only read in Ellen 's face hardihood and recklessness . We rather think Mrs. Hamilton would have read something very different ; but she was very much engaged with Edward , and if she did think Ellen looked much more out of spirits , she attributed it to natural feeling at the rapid approach of the day of separation . For her brother 's sake , to prove to him she could enter into his joy , she tried very hard not to evince the least symptom of depression , and never to cry before him at least ; though every night , that told her another day had gone , and brought before her all sorts of vague feelings and fancies of dread , she either cried herself to sleep , or laid awake , still more unhappy . The suspicion attached to her seemed to double the severity of the trial of parting . Edward was her own ; Edward must love her , with all her faults ; but even her aunt , her kind , dear , good aunt , must cease to have any affection for her , if so constantly believed guilty of a sin so terrible as falsehood . And she seemed to love her brother still more than ever , every day that brought the hour of parting nearer — sometimes as if she could not bear the pain of not being able to look at his bright face , and listen to his glad laugh and dear voice for three , perhaps six long years . Her aunt 's gentle kindness seemed to increase her unhappiness , for though she knew she was innocent , still she felt , if Miss Harcourt had told Mrs. Hamilton , she could not be so caressed and cared for and she was receiving that which she was believed to have forfeited . Miss Harcourt 's face certainly seemed to ask her as distinctly as words , how she could be so artful — so deceitful — as to permit her aunt to take such notice of her ; and so she often shrunk away , when she most longed to sit by and listen to her . Edward 's spirits never sobered , except now and then , when he thought of leaving Mrs. Hamilton , to whom he had given the same love he had lavished on his mother , perhaps to a still greater extent , for reverence was largely mingled with it . Mr Howard , too , was another whom he grieved to leave , and Mrs. Hamilton so trusted in these apparently strong affections and his good disposition , as to feel but little anxiety ; merely sorrow that she was to lose him for a profession of danger . She did not know , nor did Mr. Howard , nor Edward himself , that he was one who would be guided more by the influence of those with whom he was intimately thrown , than by any memory of the absent , or judgment of his own . Ellen 's manner on Monday evening annoyed and prejudiced Miss Harcourt still more ; Mrs. Greville and Mary , Lady Helen and all her family , bringing Caroline home with them , Mr. Howard , and some of Edward 's favorite companions , all assembled at Oakwood , and every one was determined to be gay and cheerful , and Edward 's voice was the merriest , and his laugh the happiest there ; and Ellen , though her head ached with the effort , and the constant struggle of the preceding week , was quite cheerful too , and talked to Mary Greville , and Lilla and Cecil Grahame , and even to Mr. Howard , as Miss Harcourt felt she had no right to do ; and as must prove her to be that which she had always fancied her . Mrs. Hamilton , on the contrary , saw that in the very midst of a laugh , or of speaking , her niece 's eye would rest upon Edward , and the lip quite quiver , and her smile become for the moment so strained , that she was satisfied Ellen 's cheerfulness proceeded from no want of feeling ; she wondered , indeed , at so much control at such an early age , but she loved her for it , notwithstanding . Once only Ellen was nearly conquered . Mary had begged her to sing a little Hindoo air , of which she was particularly fond , and Edward , hearing the request , said eagerly — "
104731	104863	104864	104864	I	0	" She had never in her whole life felt so disinclined to sing , so as if it were quite impossible — as if she must cry if she did ; but Edward would think it so unkind if she refused , for she did not know herself why his very words should have increased the difficulty , and what reason could she give him ? Mary went and asked Mrs. Hamilton to accompany her ; and Ellen did her very best , but her voice would tremble , and just before the end of the second verse it failed entirely ; but still she was glad she had tried , for on Mrs. Hamilton saying , very kindly , and in a voice that only she and Mary could hear , "
104888	105429	104881	104881	you	1826	" Mary seemed to understand at once why it had been so difficult for her to oblige her , and to be quite sorry she had pressed it so much , and Edward had thanked her , and told her he should sing it in idea very often . She tried to be merry again , but she could not succeed as before , and so she kept as near her aunt as she could , all the remainder of the evening , as if she were only safe there . Edward , too , had a hard battle with himself , as one by one his favorite companions took leave of him with a hearty shake of the hand , and eager — but in some , half - choked wishes for his health and prosperity ; and when all had gone , and Mr. Howard , who had remained for prayers , took him in his arms , and solemnly prayed God to bless him , and save him from danger and temptation , and permit him to return to his family , improved in all things that would make him an affectionate guardian to his orphan sister , and repay all the love and care of his aunt and uncle , it was a desperate effort that prevented him from sobbing like a child ; but he had his midshipman 's uniform on for the first time , and he was quite resolved he would not disgrace it ; therefore he only returned Mr. Howard 's embrace very warmly , and ran out of the room . But when his aunt went into his room an hour afterward , it appeared as if he had put off his pride and his uniform together , for , though he was fast asleep , his pillow was quite wet with tears . The next morning was a very sad one , though Percy and his father did all they could to make it cheerful ( we ought to have said before that Percy and Herbert were both going with Mr. Hamilton and Edward ) . No one liked the idea of losing Edward for so long a time . He had made himself a favorite with all , even with every one of the servants , who , when the carriage was ready at eleven o'clock , thronged into the hall to take a last look at him . He was so altered , that he had that morning , actually of his own accord , shaken hands with every one of them who had ever done any thing for him , especially Ellis and Morris , and Robert , to whom he had given a very handsome present , and thanked him for all his attention . He kept up very manfully till he came to his aunt , whose emotion , as she held him in a close embrace , was so unusually visible , and for the moment he seemed so to love her , that the idea of the sea lost half its delight , and he felt as if he could almost have liked to remain with her . But Percy 's joyous voice — "
105469	105870	105452	105452	you	194	" roused him , and he tried to laugh in the midst of his tears , gave Ellen another kiss , and ran into the carriage , where he was quickly followed by his uncle and cousins , and in a very few minutes Oakwood , dear , happy Oakwood , as his whole heart felt it at that moment , was hidden from his sight . Ellen remained by the window , looking after the carriage , long after it was impossible to see or hear it , very pale , and her eyes very heavy , but not in tears ; and as her aunt went to her , and put her arm round her , and began talking to her very cheerfully of all Edward would have to write to her about , and how soon they might hear from him , and that Ellen should answer him as often and as fully as she liked , and that she would not even ask to see her letters to him , or all his to her , as they might have many little affectionate things to say to each other , that they might not care about any one else seeing , and she would trust them both — Ellen seemed as if one pain was soothed , and if indeed she heard often from him , she might bear his departure . But there was still the other source of unhappiness , recalled every time she met Miss Harcourt 's cold suspicious look , which had not changed even then . Still she tried to join her cousins , and get her work , for there were no studies that morning , and so some little time passed , by Mrs. Hamilton 's exertions , almost cheerfully ; but then Ellen left the room to get something she wanted , and , in seeking her own , passed Edward 's room , the door of which stood half open . She could not resist entering , and every thing spoke of him so vividly , and yet seemed so to tell her he had gone , really gone , and she was quite alone , that all the pain came back again worse than ever , and she laid her head on his pillow , and her long - checked tears flowed with almost passionate violence . "
105884	105897	105875	105875	I	0	" said her aunt 's kind voice , full an hour afterward ; "
106184	106185	106173	106173	Alice	195	" "
106194	106227	106173	106173	Alice	195	" answered Ellen , trying to check her tears , but clasping her arms still closer round her aunt , as if dreading that her own words should send her from her . "
106246	106287	106244	106244	me	0	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , surprised and almost alarmed . But Ellen could not go on , much as she wished it , for her momentary courage had deserted her , and she could only cry more bitterly than before . "
106304	106319	106299	106299	you	113	" inquired her aunt , after waiting several minutes , and speaking very sorrowfully . "
106376	106377	106378	106378	You	113	" "
106452	106518	106519	106519	I	0	" Ellen tried to obey , but her grief had gained such an ascendency , that it was very difficult . Mrs. Hamilton looked very thoughtful when she ceased , for she really was more perplexed than she allowed Ellen to perceive ; and the poor child , fancying her silence could only mean disbelief and condemnation , remained quiet and trembling by her side . "
106545	106555	106529	106529	Ellen	113	" she said , after several minutes ' thought . "
106583	106607	106608	106608	Ellen	113	" Ellen thought that was quite impossible ; but , inexpressibly comforted by her aunt 's trust , she went with her directly . "
106627	106649	106614	106614	you	113	" Mrs. Hamilton said , directly she entered , addressing Miss Harcourt , who was sitting reading with Caroline and Emmeline , "
106712	106713	106714	106714	I	0	" "
106723	106728	106734	106734	she	113	" replied Miss Harcourt ; "
106759	106778	106752	106752	she	113	" Ellen had brought her book while Miss Harcourt was speaking , and Mrs. Hamilton attentively examined it . "
106792	106793	106790	106790	Caroline	120	" "
106846	106847	106830	106830	we	1849	" "
106882	106883	106853	106853	you	113	" "
106892	106898	106887	106887	you	113	" answered Caroline , smiling . "
106941	106942	106944	106944	you	113	" "
106962	106963	106944	106944	you	113	" "
106993	107018	106985	106985	I	0	" And with her usual quickness of movement , Caroline unlocked her desk , drew forth her book , and ran over the leaves . "
107029	107030	106985	106985	I	0	" "
107043	107044	107032	107032	you	113	" "

107081	107082	107072	107072	you	113	" "
107092	107093	107072	107072	you	113	" "
107106	107107	107096	107097	Miss Harcourt	112	" "
107117	107118	107096	107097	Miss Harcourt	112	" "
107135	107136	107128	107128	you	113	" "
107224	107225	107205	107205	I	0	" "
107277	107301	107264	107264	she	113	" she added , observing that Caroline looked as if some sudden light had flashed upon her , and then , really grieved . "
107447	107448	107452	107452	she	113	" "
107468	107510	107452	107452	she	113	" said Mrs. Hamilton , truly relieved , not only from the explanation , but perceiving Caroline 's voluntarily offered kiss was willingly and heartily returned by Ellen . It was almost the first she had ever seen exchanged between them . "
107529	107535	107524	107524	you	113	" said Ellen , earnestly ; "
107555	107556	107548	107548	she	112	" "
107565	107595	107548	107548	she	112	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , perceiving in a moment that Miss Harcourt still doubted , and ringing the bell , she desired the footman to send Fanny to her . "
107620	107624	107627	107627	madam	1495	" she asked . "
107629	107630	107627	107627	madam	1495	" "
107641	107642	107645	107645	madam	1495	" "
107713	107714	107696	107697	Mrs. Ellis	135	" "
107738	107802	107725	107726	Miss Ellen	113	" replied her mistress , quite unable to suppress a smile , and Ellen hastily took out a large sheet of writing paper , and the moment Fanny returned ( she seemed gone an age ) gave it to her , and seized her own , which she placed in her aunt 's hand , without being able to speak a single word . "
107829	107863	107864	107864	I	0	" said Mrs. Hamilton , the moment Fanny had left the room , delighted with the exchange , and drawing Ellen close to her , for the poor child could really scarcely stand . "
107878	107904	107873	107873	I	0	" replied Miss Harcourt directly , and Mrs. Hamilton would have been better pleased had she stopped there , but she could not help adding , "
107923	107951	107952	107952	I	0	" Ellen 's first impulse had been to go to her , but her last words caused her to bury her face on her aunt 's shoulder . "
107978	107985	107990	107990	you	113	" resumed Mrs. Hamilton , playfully ; "
108124	108221	108117	108120	such a complete woman	1874	" Emmeline , quite proud of the charge , and more grieved than she very well knew how to express , till she was quite alone with Ellen , that she , too , had suspected and been cold to her the last week , left the room with her cousin . Caroline seemed to hesitate for a moment , but she was quite certain by her mother 's face that she wished to speak with Miss Harcourt , and so , without being told , took up her book , and went into the library . "
108237	108248	108227	108227	I	0	" began Mrs. Hamilton , the moment they were alone . "
108261	108267	108268	108268	you	111	" was her instant reply ; "
108325	108326	108311	108311	they	1877	" "
108625	108626	108621	108621	you	111	" "

108809	108819	108820	108820	You	111	" exclaimed Miss Harcourt , with most unusual fervor . "

108915	108923	108913	108913	Ellen	113	" repeated Miss Harcourt , much surprised ; "

109292	109300	109283	109283	I	0	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , laughing also ; "
109327	109335	109336	109336	you	1900	" she continued , rather more seriously ; "
109357	110031	109336	109336	you	1900	" and Miss Harcourt willingly assented . The day passed much more happily than the morning could have anticipated . Emmeline 's nursing was so affectionate and successful , that Ellen was quite able to join them at dinner , and her aunt had selected such a very interesting story to read aloud , in which one character was a young sailor , that the hours seemed to fly ; and then they had a long talk about poor Alice Seaton and her brother , whether it would be possible for Mr. Hamilton to place young Seaton in a situation that he liked better , and that his health was more fitted for . Ellen said she should like to see and know Alice so much , for her trial must be such a very hard one , that her aunt promised her she should in the midsummer holidays , for Alice should then come and spend a week with them . It seemed as if not to be able to wish Edward good - night , and kiss him , brought back some of the pain again ; but she found that thinking about poor Alice , and fancying how miserable she must be , if she loved her aunt as dearly as she did Mrs. Hamilton , to be obliged to part from her as well as her brother , and live at a school , made her pain seem less absorbing ; as if to help Alice would do more toward curing it than any thing . And though , of course , every day , for a little while , she seemed to miss Edward more and more , still her aunt 's affection and her own efforts , prepared her to see her uncle and cousins return , and listen to all they could tell her about him , without any increase of pain . Our readers must imagine that two years and four months have elapsed since our last visit to the inmates of Oakwood . It was the first week in March that Edward Fortescue ( only wanting ten days for the completion of his fourteenth year ) quitted a home , which was happier than any he had ever known , to enter the world as a sailor ; and it is the 7th of June , two years later , the day on which Ellen Fortescue completes her fifteenth year , that we recommence our narrative . Over this interval , however , much as we are anxious to proceed , we must take a brief glance , clearly to understand the aspect of the Oakwood home affairs , which , from the increasing age of the younger members , had undergone some slight change . The greatest and most keenly felt was the departure of Percy and Herbert for college , the October twelvemonth after Edward had gone ; the house seemed actually desolate without them . Percy 's wild jokes and inexhaustible spirits , and Herbert 's quiet , unobtrusive kindness , much as they had always been truly appreciated by their home circle , still scarcely seemed to have been fully felt till the young men were gone ; and the old house actually seemed enwrapped in a silence , which it required very determined effort on the part of all who remained in the least degree to dispel . Our readers who are mothers , and earnest ones , will easily understand the anxious tremblings of Mrs. Hamilton 's heart , when she parted from her boys for the world : for such , to spirits fresh , boyish , unsophisticated , as they still were , Oxford could not fail to be . For Herbert , indeed , she had neither fear nor doubt : no sneer , no temptation , no bad example , would affect him , in whom every passing year seemed to increase and deepen those exalted feelings which , in his earliest childhood , had "
110040	114321	114322	114322	My	0	" His piety was so real , his faith so fervent , his affections so concentrated in his home and in one other individual , his love and pursuit of study so ardent and unceasing , his one aim , to become worthy in heart and mind to serve God as his minister , so ever present , that he was effectually guarded even from the world . Percy had none of these feelings to the same extent , save his ardent love for home and its inmates — his mother , above all . He did , indeed , give every promise that the principles so carefully instilled had taken firm root , and would guide his conduct in the world ; but Mrs. Hamilton was too humble - minded — too convinced that every human effort is imperfect , without the sustaining and vitalizing grace of God , to rest in security , as many might have done , that because she had so worked , so prayed , she must succeed . She was hopeful , indeed , very hopeful — how could she be otherwise when she beheld his deep , though silent , reverence for sacred things — his constant and increasing respect and love for his father — his devoted affection for herself — his attachment to Herbert , which seemed so strangely yet so beautifully to combine almost reverence for his superior mind and holier spirit , with the caressing protectiveness of an older for a younger — a stronger for a weaker ? There was much in all this to banish anxiety altogether , but not from such a heart as Mrs. Hamilton 's , whose very multiplicity of blessings made her often tremble , and led her to the footstool of her God , with a piety as humble , as constant , as fervent , as many believe is the fruit of adversity alone . Caroline had sufficiently improved as greatly to decrease solicitude on her account : though there was still a want of sufficient humility , a too great proneness to trust implicitly in her own strength , an inclination to prejudice , and a love of admiration , which all made Mrs. Hamilton fear would expose her to some personal sorrow ere they were entirely overcome . To produce eternal good , she might not murmur at temporal suffering ; but her fond heart , though it could anticipate it calmly for herself , so shrunk from it , as touching her child , that the nearer approached the period of Caroline 's introduction to the gay world , the more painfully anxious she became , and the more gladly would she have retained her in the retirement of Oakwood , where all her better and higher qualities alone had play . But she knew this could not be ; and she could only trust that her anxiety would be proved as groundless with Caroline , as every letter from Oxford proved it to be with Percy , and endeavor to avert it by never wavering in her watchful and guiding love . Emmeline , at fifteen , was just the same sportive , happy , innocent child as she had been at twelve . Her feelings were , indeed , still deeper , her imagination more vivid , her religion more fervid . To her every thing was touched with poetry — it mattered not how dull and commonplace it might seem to other people ; but Mrs. Hamilton 's judicious care had so taught that Truth alone was poetry and beauty — the Ideal only lovable when its basis was the Real — that she was neither romantic nor visionary . Keen as her sensibilities were , even over a work of fiction , they prompted the deed and act of kindness , not the tear alone . For miles round her father 's large domain she was known , loved , so felt as a guardian spirit , that the very sound of her step seemed to promise joy . She actually seemed to live for others — making their pleasures hers ; and , withal , so joyous , especially in her own home and at Greville Manor , that even anxiety seemed exorcised when she was near . Before strangers , indeed , she would be as shy as a young fawn ; though even then natural kindliness of heart prompted such kindness of word and manner , as always to excite the wish to see her again . Edward , in the two years and a quarter which he had been away , had only once occasioned anxiety . Two or three months after he had sailed , he wrote home in the highest terms of a certain Gilbert Harding , one of the senior midshipmen of his ship , from whom he had received kindness upon kindness ; and who , being six or seven years older than himself , he jestingly wrote to his aunt and uncle , must certainly be the very best friend he could have chosen , as he was much too old to lead him into mischief . Why he ( Harding ) had taken such a fancy to him , Edward could not tell ; but he was so excessively kind , so taught him his duty , and smoothed all the difficulties and disagreeables which , he owned , had at first seemed overwhelming , that he never could be grateful enough . He added , that , though not a general favorite with his immediate messmates , he was very highly esteemed by Sir Edward Manly and his other superior officers , and that the former had much commended him for his kindness to the youngest boy on board , which Edward was . It was very easy to perceive that young Fortescue 's susceptible affections had all been not only attracted , but already riveted by this new friend . All the young party at Oakwood rejoiced at it ; Mrs. Hamilton would have done so also , had she not perceived an anxious expression on her husband 's face , which alarmed her . He did not , however , make any remark till he had spoken to Mr. Howard , and then imparted to his wife alone ( not choosing to create suspicion in the open hearts of his children ) that this Gilbert Harding , though very young at the time had been one of the principal actors in the affair which had caused Mr. Howard to dismiss his pupils , as we related in a former page ; that his very youth , for he could scarcely have been more than eleven or twelve , and determined hardihood , so marked natural depravity , that Mr. Howard had had less hope for him than for any of the others . This opinion had been borne out by his after conduct at home ; but the affair had been successfully hushed up by his family ; and by immense interest he been permitted to enter the navy , where , it was said , his youthful errors had been so redeemed , and his courage and conduct altogether had so won him applause , that no farther fears were entertained for him . Mr. Howard alone retained his opinion , that the disposition was naturally bad , and doubted the internal response to the seeming outward good ; and he was grieved and anxious beyond measure , when he heard that he was not only on board the same ship as Edward , but already his favorite companion and most trusted friend . His anxiety , of course , extended itself to Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton to such a degree , that at the first moment they would gladly have endeavored to exchange his ship ; but this would have seemed very strange to Sir Edward Manly , who was one of Mr. Hamilton 's most valued friends . He had , in fact , actually delayed Edward 's becoming a midshipman till Sir Edward could take him in his own ship and now to place him elsewhere was really impossible ; and , after all , though he might be removed from Harding 's influence , how could his anxious guardians know all with whom he might be thrown ? They were obliged to content themselves with writing earnestly and affectionately to Edward ; and , painful as it was , to throw a doubt and shade over such youthful confidence and affection , implored him not to trust too implicitly in Harding ; that his character had not always been free from stain ; that he ( Edward ) was still so young and so susceptible , he might find that he had imbibed principles , and been tempted to wrong almost unconsciously , and suffer from its effects when too late to escape . They wrote as affectionately and indulgently as they could — Mr. Howard , as well as his aunt and uncle ; but still they felt that it certainly did appear cruel to warn a young , warm heart to break off the first friendship it had formed ; especially as he beheld that friend approved of by his captain , and looked up to by the crew . And that Edward 's reply was somewhat cold , though he did promise caution , and assure them he had not so forgotten the influences and principles of Oakwood as to allow any one to lead him into error , did not surprise them . He never referred to Harding again , except sometimes casually to mention his companionship , or some act which had won him approval ; and they really hoped their letters had had at least the effect of putting him on his guard . Sir Edward Manly 's own reply to Mr. Hamilton 's anxious appeal to him , however , succeeded in quieting their fears ; he assured them he had seen nothing in Harding 's conduct , since he had been at sea , to render him an unfit companion for any boy : that he had heard of some boyish faults , but it was rather hard he was to suffer from them as a man ; and he assured his friends that he would keep a strict look - out after young Fortescue , and the first appearance of a change in a character which , young as he was , he could not help loving , should be inquired into , and the friendship ended by sending Harding to some other ship . So wrote Sir Edward Manly , with the fullest possible intention to perform ; and Edward 's anxious friends were happy , more especially as letter after letter brought praises of the young sailor from captain , officers , and crew , and his own epistles , though brief , were affectionate and satisfactory . It was happy for Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton , and Mr. Howard , too , that they were ignorant of the multiplicity of great and little things which could not fail to engross the mind of Sir Edward Manly , who was not only captain of the Prince William , a gallant seventy - four , but commander of the little flotilla which accompanied him , or they could not have rested so secure . Happy for them too , during those years of separation , that they were not perfectly acquainted with Edward 's real weakness of character , or of the fearful extent of mischief which the influences of his first twelve years had engendered . Had he remained at Oakwood till nineteen or twenty , it is probable they would have been insensibly conquered , and the impressions of good , which he had appeared so readily to receive , really taken root and guided his after life , but eighteen months could not do this , as Mrs. Hamilton would have felt , had she known all the effect of her sister 's ill - judged partiality and indulgence ; but this , as we have already mentioned , was concealed from her by the bright , lovable , winning qualities , which alone were uppermost . Our readers , in fact , know more of Edward ( if they have at all thought of his conduct in so frequently allowing his sister to suffer for him ) than his aunt , penetrative as she was ; and , therefore , in the events we shall have occasion to relate , we trust that Mrs. Hamilton will not appear an inconsistent character , inasmuch that one in general so successfully observant , should fail in penetration when most needed . Edward 's life at Oakwood had been so very happy , its pleasures and indulgences so innocent , so numerous , that he did not himself know his liability to temptation , from the excessive love of pleasure which his mother 's indiscreet indulgence had originally infused . The control which his uncle and Mr. Howard exercised over him had been so very gentle and forbearing , that he had scarcely ever felt the inclination to exert self - will , and when it so chanced that he had , Ellen had covered his fault , or borne its penalty for him . He thought he had guided himself , when , in fact , he was guided ; but this could no longer be the case when one of the little world which thronged a first - rate man - of - war . Outward actions were , indeed , under control ; but what captain , the most earnest , most able in the world , could look into and guide the hearts of all those committed to his care ? And almost the first action of Edward 's unbiased will was indignantly to tear into shreds , and scatter to the winds and the waves , those affectionate and warning letters , and cling the more closely to , rest the more confidingly on Harding , for the wrong that he thought he had done him , by allowing his eye even to rest for a moment on such base , unfounded aspersions on his name . When Mrs. Hamilton told Ellen that her letters to her brother , and his to her , should never be subjected to any scrutiny but their own , she acted on a principle which many parents and guardians would consider as high - flown and romantic , and which she herself had most painful reason to regret — the effects , at least , but not the principle itself , for that was based on too refined a feeling to waver , even though she suffered from it . She could not bear , nor could her husband , the system which prevailed in some families of their acquaintance , that their children could neither receive nor write letters to each other , or their intimate friends , without being shown to their seniors . As for opening and reading a letter directed to one of them , before its possessor saw it , as they had seen done , it was , in their estimation , as much dishonor and as mean , as if such a thing had been done to an adult . Perfect confidence in their home they had indeed instilled , and that confidence was never withheld . There was a degree of suspicion attached to a demand always to see what a child had written or received , from which Mrs. Hamilton 's pure mind actually shrunk in loathing . In the many months the Grahame family passed in London , Annie and Caroline corresponded without the least restraint : no doubt many would pronounce Mrs. Hamilton very unwise , knowing Annie so well , and trembling for Caroline as she did ; but , as she told Miss Harcourt , she had some notions peculiar to herself ( they always had the sanction and sympathy of her husband , however ) , and this was one of them . She was always pleased and interested in all that her children read to her , either from their own epistles or those they received , and if they wished it , read them herself , but she never asked to do so , and the consequence was , that the most perfect confidence was given . When Ellen and Edward parted , they were both so young , that Mr. Hamilton had hesitated as to whether his wife was quite justified in the perfect trust with which she treated them , and whether it would not be wiser to overlook their correspondence ; but Mrs. Hamilton so argued that their very youth was their safeguard , that they were all in all to each other , and as such she wished them to feel they were bound by even a closer and a fonder tie than that of brother and sister under other circumstances , so won over her husband that he yielded ; and from the long extracts that Ellen would read of Edward 's letters to the family in general , and of her own to her aunt , he was quite satisfied as to the wisdom of his wife 's judgment . For full a year after Edward 's departure , Ellen 's conduct and general improvement had given her aunt nothing but pleasure ; even Miss Harcourt 's and Caroline 's prejudice was nearly removed , though , at times , the fancy would steal over both that she was not exactly what she seemed , and that that which was hidden was not exactly that which Mrs. Hamilton believed it ; and this fancy strengthened by a certain indefinable yet felt change in Ellen , commencing about thirteen months after she had parted from her brother . Mrs. Hamilton herself , for some time strove against belief , but at length she could no longer conceal from herself that Ellen was becoming reserved again , and fearful , at times almost shrinking , and sad , as in her childhood . The openness , and almost light - heartedness , which for one brief year had so characterized her , seemed completely but so insensibly to have gone , that Mrs. Hamilton could not satisfy herself as to the time of the commencement , or reason of the change . Her temper , too , became fitful , and altogether her aunt 's anxiety and bewilderment as to her real character returned in full force . Once , when gently questioned as to why her temper was so altered , Ellen confessed with tears , that she knew it was , but she could not help it , she believed she was not well ; and Mrs. Hamilton called in Mr. Maitland , who said that she really was in a highly nervous state , and required care and quietness , and the less notice that was taken of her momentary irritability or depression the better . Little did the worthy man imagine how his young patient blessed him for these words ; giving a reason for and so allowing the trepidation which paled her cheek , parched her lips , and made her hand so tremble , when she received a letter from her brother , to pass unnoticed . But change in manner was not all ; almost every second or third month Ellen 's allowance of pocket - money ( which was unusually liberal , as Mrs. Hamilton wished to accustom her girls , from an early age , to purchase some few articles of dress for themselves , and so learn the value of money ) most strangely and mysteriously disappeared . Ellen either could not or would not give any account of it ; and , of course , it not only exposed her to her aunt 's most serious displeasure , but inexpressibly heightened not only Mrs. Hamilton 's bewilderment and anxiety , but Miss Harcourt 's and Caroline 's unspoken prejudice . From the time of Edward 's departure , Ellen had never been discovered in or suspected of either uttering or acting an untruth ; but her silence , her apparent determined ignorance of , or resolution not to confess the cause of the incomprehensible disappearance of her allowance , naturally compelled Mrs. Hamilton to revert to the propensity of her childhood , and fear that truthfulness was again deserting her . Her displeasure lasting of course , the longer from Ellen 's want of openness , and the air of what almost appeared to her anxious yet still affectionate aunt like sullen defiance ( in reality , it was almost despair ) , when spoken to , caused a painful degree of estrangement between them , always , however , giving place to Mrs. Hamilton 's usual caressing manner , the moment Ellen seemed really repentant , and her month 's expenditure could be properly explained . For six or eight months before the day on which we recommence our narrative , there had been , however , nothing to complain of in Ellen , except still that unnatural reserve and frequent depression , as if dreading something she knew not what , which , as every other part of her conduct was satisfactory , Mrs. Hamilton tried to comfort herself was physical alone . No reference to the past was ever made : her manner to her niece became the same as usual ; but she could not feel secure as to her character , and , what was most painful , there were times when she was compelled to doubt even Ellen 's affection for herself , a thing she had never had the slightest cause to do even when she was a little inanimate child . But very few changes had taken place in the Greville and Grahame families . Mrs. Greville 's trial continued in unmitigated , if not heightened bitterness : the example , the companionship of his father had appeared to have blighted every good seed which she had strenuously endeavored to plant in the bosom of her son . At sixteen he was already an accomplished man of the world , in its most painful sense : he had his own companions , his own haunts ; scarcely ever visiting his home , for a reason which , could his poor mother have known it , would have given her some slight gleam of comfort . He could not associate either with her or his sister , without feeling a sort of loathing of himself , a longing to be to them as Percy and Herbert Hamilton were at Oakwood ; and not having the moral courage sufficient to break from the control of his father , and the exciting pleasures in which that control initiated him , he shrunk more and more from the only spot in which better feelings were so awakened within him as to give him pain . To deaden this unacknowledged remorse , his manner was rude and unfeeling , so that his very visits , though inexpressibly longed for by his mother , brought only increase of grief . Mrs. Greville seemed herself so inured to suffering , that she bore up against it without any visible failing of health ; struggling against its enervating effects , more , perhaps , than she was aware of herself , for the sake of one treasure still granted her — her own almost angel Mary — who , she knew , without her love and constant cheerfulness , must sink beneath such a constant aggravated trial . Yet that very love brought increase of anxiety from more than one cause . As yet there was no change in their manner of living , but Mrs. Greville knew that , from the excesses of her husband and son , there very soon must be . Ruin , poverty , all its fearful ills , stood before her in perspective , and how could Mary 's fragile frame and gentle spirit bear up against them ? Again and again the question pressed upon her — Did Herbert Hamilton indeed love her child , as every passing year seemed to confirm ? and if he did , would — could his parents consent to his union with the child of such a father , the sister of such a brother ? There were always long messages to Mary in Herbert 's letters to his mother , which Mrs. Hamilton not only delivered herself , but sometimes even put the whole letter into Mary 's hand , and at last laughingly said , she really thought they had much better write to each other , as then she should chance to get a letter all to herself , not merely be the medium of a communication between them ; and Mary , though she did slightly blush , which she was in the habit of doing for scarcely any thing , seemed to think it so perfectly natural , that she merely said , if Herbert had time to write to her , she should like it very much , and would certainly answer him . "
114331	114345	114328	114328	you	78	" was Mrs. Greville 's anxious appeal , the moment they were alone . "
114361	114369	114355	114355	I	0	" was Mrs. Hamilton 's laughing reply . "
114427	114428	114429	114429	She	143	" "
114436	114462	114429	114429	She	143	" answered the poor mother , with such a quivering of the eye and lip , that it checked Mrs. Hamilton 's joyousness at once . "
114481	114504	114466	114466	Mary	143	" was her instant reply , with a pressure of Mrs. Greville 's hand , that said far more than her words . "
114727	117185	114719	114719	her	143	" And she was right . Nor , we think , did the purity and innocence of those letters , so intensely interesting to each other , give place to any other style , even when they chanced to discover that Mrs. Hamilton was utterly ignorant of their contents , except that which they chose to read or impart to her themselves . But even this assurance on the part of one so loved and trusted as Mrs. Hamilton , could not entirely remove Mrs. Greville 's vague anticipations of evil . Mr. Greville always shunned , and declared he hated the Hamilton family ; but as he seemed to entertain the same feeling toward herself and her poor Mary , she tried to comfort herself by the idea that he would never trouble his head about his daughter ; or be glad to get her out of his way , especially if she married well . Still anxiety for the future would press upon her ; only calmed by her firm , unchanging faith in that gracious , ever - watchful Providence , who , if in spite of her heavy troubles she still tried to trust and serve , would order all things for the best ; and it was this , this faith alone , which so supported her , as to permit her to make her child 's home and heart almost as happy as if her path had all been smooth . In the Grahame family a change had taken place , in Master Cecil 's being sent to Eton some time before his father had intended ; but so many cases of Lady Helen 's faulty indolence and ruinous indulgence had come under his notice , that he felt to remove the boy from her influence must be accomplished at any cost . Cecil was quite delighted , but his mother was so indignant , that she overcame her habitual awe of her husband sufficiently to vow that she would not live so far from her son , and if he must go to school , she must leave Moorlands . Grahame , with equal positiveness , declared that he would not give up a home endeared to him so long , nor to entirely break off his companionship with his dearest friends . A very stormy dialogue of course took place , and ended by both parties being more resolved to entertain their own opinion . The interposition of Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton , however , obtained some concession on Grahame 's part , and he promised that if Lady Helen would make Moorlands her home from the middle of July till the end of October , November and December should be spent in the vicinity of Eton , and she should then have six months for London and its attractions . This concession brought back all Lady Helen 's smiles , and charmed Annie , though it was a source of real regret to Caroline , who could not help feeling a little pained at her friend 's small concern at this long separation from her . But still she loved her ; and , as Annie wrote frequently , and when she was at Moorlands never tired of her society ( the eight months of absence giving her so much interesting matter to impart ) , Caroline was not only satisfied , but insensible to the utter want of sympathy which Annie manifested in her pursuits , her pleasures . Mrs. Hamilton often wished that Caroline had chosen one more deserving of her friendship , but she trusted that time and experience would teach her Annie 's real character , and so did not feel any anxiety on that score . There was only one member in Grahame 's family , that Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton hoped might bring joy and comfort to their friend , and that was his little Lilla . She was five years younger than Annie , and being much less attractive , seemed almost forgotten , and so was spared the dangerous ordeal of flattery and indulgence to which Annie had been subject ; and from being more violent and less agreeable than Cecil , was not so frequently spoiled by her mother . They feared the poor child would have much to endure from her own temper , Annie 's overbearing insolence , and Lady Helen 's culpable indolence ; but Mrs. Hamilton hoped , when she resided part of the year in London , as she felt she would very soon be called upon to do , to be enabled to rouse Grahame 's attention toward his youngest child , and prevail on him to relax in his sternness toward her ; and by taking notice of her continually herself , instill such feelings in her as would attract her toward her father , and so increase the happiness of both . Every visit of the Grahame family to Moorlands , she resolved to study Lilla well , and try all she could to make one in reality so estimable , as her husband 's friend , happy , in one child at least . It had been Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton 's intention to go to London the January after Caroline was seventeen , and give her the advantage of finishing masters , and a partial introduction to the world , by having the best society at home , before she launched into all its exciting pleasures ; to return to Oakwood in July or August , and revisit the metropolis the following February or March , for the season , when , as she would be eighteen and a half , she should be fully introduced . Caroline , of course , anticipated this period with intense delight . She was quite satisfied that in her first visit she should study as much as , if not more than before ; and content and thankful that her mother would allow her to enter so far into society , as always to join dinner or evening parties at home , and go to some of her most intimate friends , when their coteries were very small and friendly ; and , another eagerly anticipated delight , sometimes go to the opera and the best concerts , and visit all the galleries of art . To poor Emmeline these anticipations gave no pleasure whatever ; she hated the very thought of leaving Oakwood , firmly convinced that not the most highly intellectual , nor the most delightful social enjoyment in London , could equal the pure delights of Devonshire and home . Ellen seemed too engrossed with her own thoughts to evince a feeling either way , much to her aunt 's regret , as her constant quietness and seeming determined repression of her sentiments , rendered her character still more difficult to read . But a heavy disappointment was preparing for Caroline , in the compelled postponement of her bright anticipations ; to understand the causes of which , we must glance back on an event in the Hamilton family , which had occurred some years before its present head was born . In the early part of the reign of George the Third , Arthur Hamilton , the grandfather of our friend of the same name , had been sent by government to the coast of Denmark : his estimable character so won him the regard of the reigning sovereign , Christian VII . , that , on his departure , the royal wish was expressed for his speedy return.—On his voyage home , he was wrecked off the Feroe Islands , and rescued from danger and death by the strenuous exertions of the islanders , who entertained him and the crew with the utmost hospitality , till their ship was again seaworthy . During his involuntary detention , Mr. Hamilton became deeply interested in the Feroese , a people living , it seemed , in the midst of desolation , a cluster of small rocky islets , divided by some hundred miles of stormy sea from their fellows . He made the tour of the islands , and found almost all their inhabitants possessing the same characteristics as those of Samboe , the island off which he had been wrecked ; kind , hospitable , honest , temperate , inclined to natural piety , but so perfectly indifferent to the various privations and annoyances of their lot , as to make no effort toward removing them . Traveling either by land or sea was so dangerous and difficult , that in some parishes the clergyman could only perform service twice a year,[3 ] or once every one , two , or three months . The islands in which the clergyman resided were , Mr. Hamilton observed , in a much higher state of civilization and morality than Samboe and some others , and an earnest desire took possession of him , to do some real service for those who had saved him from danger and treated him so hospitably . He very speedily acquired their language , which gave him still more influence . He found , also , that if their ancient customs and traditions were left undisturbed , they were very easily led , and this discovery strengthened his purpose.—His departure was universally regretted ; and his promise to return imagined too great a privilege to be believed . As soon as his political duties in England permitted , Mr. Hamilton revisited Denmark , and was received with such cordiality as to encourage him to make his petition for the improvement of his majesty 's poor subjects of Samboe . It was granted directly ; the little island so far made over to him , that he was at liberty to introduce and erect whatever he pleased within it ; and Mr. Hamilton , all eagerness for the perfection of his plans , returned with speed to England ; obtained the valuable aid of a poor though worthy clergyman , who , with his wife , voluntarily offered to make Samboe their home , and assist their benefactor ( for such Mr. Hamilton had long been ) , to the very best of their ability . A strong - built vessel was easily procured , and a favorable voyage soon transported them to Feroe . The delight of the Samboese at beholding their former guest again , prepossessed Mr. and Mrs. Wilson in their favor , and Mr. Hamilton , before his six months ' sojourn with them was over , beheld the island in a fair way of religious and moral improvement.—Schools were formed and masters appointed — houses were made more comfortable — women and young children more cared for , and employments found , and sufficiently rewarded to encourage persevering labor . Three or four times Mr. Hamilton visited the island again before his death , and each time he had more reason to be satisfied with the effect of his schemes . Mr. and Mrs. Wilson were perfectly happy . Their son was united to the pretty and excellent daughter of one of the Danish clergymen , and a young family was blooming round them , so that there seemed a fair promise of the ministry of Samboe continuing long in charge of the same family . Mr. Hamilton , on his death - bed , exacted a promise from his son that he would not permit the island to fall back into its old habits ; but that , if required , he would visit it himself . The visit was not required , but Percy Hamilton ( the father of the present possessor of Oakwood ) , from respect to his father 's memory , made a voyage to Samboe on the demise of the elder Wilson . He found every thing flourishing and happy ; Frederic Wilson had been received as their pastor and head , with as much joy as their regret for his father would permit ; and Mr. Hamilton returned to England , satisfied with himself , and inexpressibly touched by the veneration still entertained in that distant island for his father . The same promise was demanded by him from his son , and Arthur Hamilton had visited Feroe directly after the loss of his parent , and before his engagement with Miss Manvers . He found it in the same satisfactory condition as his predecessors had done , and the letters he regularly received confirmed it ; but for the last year and a half he had received no tidings . Frederic Wilson , he knew , was dead , but his last account had told him his eldest son , who had been educated in Denmark , had been gladly received by the simple people , and promised fair to be as much loved , and do the same good as his father and grandfather . The silence then was incomprehensible , and Mr. Hamilton had resolved , if another year passed without intelligence , it would be a positive duty to visit it himself . It was the seventh of June , and one of those glorious mornings , when Nature looks lovelier than ever . The windows of the breakfast - room were thrown widely open , and never did the superb trees of Oakwood Park look richer or display a greater variety of green . The flower - garden , on part of which the breakfast - room opened , was actually dazzling with its profusion of brilliant flowers , on which the sun looked down so gloriously ; a smooth lawn whose green was a perfect emerald , stretched down from the parterre , till it was lost in woody openings , which disclosed the winding river , that , lying as a lake on one side , appeared to sweep round some exquisite scenery on the opposite side , and form another lake , about a mile further . It was Emmeline 's favorite view , and she always declared , that it so varied its aspects of loveliness , she was sure it never looked two mornings exactly alike , and so long would she stand and admire , that her mother often threatened to send her her breakfast in her own room , where the view , though picturesque , would not so completely turn her attention from the dull realities of life . There were some letters on the table this morning , so she had a longer time to drink in poetry than usual . "
117199	117215	117216	117216	I	0	" exclaimed Mrs. Hamilton , playfully holding up a letter , as her niece entered . "
117244	117245	117219	117219	Edward	76	" "
117275	117287	117288	117288	I	0	" interposed Emmeline , looking at her cousin , and laughing . "
117338	117339	117329	117329	you	113	" "
117350	117377	117329	117329	you	113	" rejoined her father , in the same mirthful tone , and looking up from his letter he called Ellen to him , and kissed her . "
117429	117430	117431	117431	I	0	" "
117444	117461	117463	117464	my aunt	3424	" replied Ellen , gratefully ( she had not yet opened her brother 's letter ) ; "
117482	117492	117467	117467	I	0	" and she displayed an elegant little gold watch ; "
117508	117521	117522	117522	I	0	" she added , so earnestly that tears came to her eyes . "
117589	117595	117584	117584	Edward	76	" he continued , smiling . "
117621	117622	117629	117629	Ellen	113	" "
117631	117636	117629	117629	Ellen	113	" asked her aunt . "
117645	117646	117629	117629	Ellen	113	" "
117664	117668	117629	117629	Ellen	113	" said Emmeline . "
117677	117684	117629	117629	Ellen	113	" interposed Mrs. Hamilton , gayly . "
117735	117736	117737	117737	Emmeline	78	" "
117745	117751	117737	117737	Emmeline	78	" said Caroline , dryly . "
117766	117773	117737	117737	Emmeline	78	" laughed her sister in reply . "
117801	117861	117863	117863	he	76	" Ellen read nearly the whole letter aloud , and it was unusually entertaining , for the ship had been cruising about the last month and Edward described the various scenes and new places he had visited more lengthily than usual . He anticipated with great glee an engagement with some desperate pirates , whose track they were pursuing . "
117868	117873	117878	117878	he	76	" inquired Mr. Hamilton . "
117905	117906	117902	117902	his	76	" "
117955	117956	117958	117958	Edward	76	" "
117979	117992	117972	117972	he	76	" exclaimed Ellen ; trembling and all the little circle looked alarmed . "
118000	118008	117997	117998	a deceiver	1952	" replied Mr. Hamilton , quite cheerfully . "
118299	118300	118287	118287	I	0	" "
118310	118320	118303	118303	you	0	" asked Ellen , trying to conquer her emotion . "
118328	118335	118303	118303	you	0	" replied her aunt , kindly . "
118423	118559	118560	118560	You	113	" And Ellen gladly obeyed ; for it was from no imaginary cause that the receipt of Edward 's letters so often paled her cheek , and parched her lip with terror . She knew that concerning him which none else but Harding did ; and even when those letters imparted nothing but that which she could read to her family , the dread was quite enough to banish any thing like the elastic happiness , natural to her age , and called for by the kindness of those she loved . His letter this time , however , had not a word to call for that sickness of the heart , with which she had received it , and she read it again and again ; with a thankfulness , too intense for words . "
118567	118589	118564	118564	Ellen	113	" said the voice of her cousin Emmeline at her door , ten minutes after she left the breakfast - room . "
118616	118617	118610	118610	I	0	" "
118644	118677	118695	118695	papa	3546	" replied Ellen as she looked at its length , not at its meaning , for the fearful lesson of quiet unconcern when the heart is bursting had been too early learned . "
118787	118838	118845	118846	that villain	1976	comes!"—and away tripped the happy girl , singing some wild snatch of an old ballad about sailors . Ellen shut the door , secured it , and with a lip and cheek colorless as her robe , an eye strained and bloodshot , read the following words — few indeed ! "
119019	119703	119704	119704	My	0	" For one long hour Ellen never moved . Her brain felt scorched , her limbs utterly powerless . Every word seemed to write itself in letters of fire on her heart and brain , till she could almost have screamed , from the dread agony ; and then came the heavy weight , so often felt before , but never crushing every thought and energy as now , the seeming utter impossibility to comply with that fearfully urged demand . He called it a sum so trifling , and she felt a hundred , ay , a thousand pounds were not more difficult to obtain . She had saved , indeed , denying herself every little indulgence , every personal gratification , spending only what she was obliged , and yet compelled to let her aunt believe she had properly expended all , that she might have the means of sending him money when he demanded it , without exposing herself to doubt and displeasure as before ; but in the eight months since his last call , she had only been enabled to put by fifteen pounds , not half the sum he needed . How was she to get the rest ? and she had so buoyed herself with the fond hope , that even if he did write for help again , she could send it to him so easily — and now — her mind seemed actually to reel beneath the intense agony of these desperate words . She was too young , too believing , and too terror - stricken to doubt for a moment the alternative he placed before her , with a vividness , a desperation , of which he was unconscious himself . Those words spoken , would have been terrible , almost awful in one so young — though a brief interval would have sufficiently calmed both the hearer and the speaker , to satisfy that they were but words , and that self - destruction is never breathed , if really intended : but written , the writer at a distance , imagination at liberty , to heighten every terror , every reality ; their reader a young loving girl , utterly ignorant of the world 's ways and temptations , and the many errors to which youth is subject , but from which manhood may spring up unsullied ; and so believing , almost crushed by the belief , that her brother , the only one , her own — respected , beloved , as he was said to be — had yet committed such faults , as would hurl him from his present position to the lowest depth of degradation , for what else could tempt him , to swear not to survive it ? Was it marvel , that poor Ellen was only conscious that she must save him?—Again did her dying mother stand before her — again did her well - remembered voice beseech her to save him her darling , beautiful Edward , from disgrace and punishment — reiterate that her word was pledged , and she must do it , and if she suffered — had she not done so from infancy — and what was her happiness to his ? Define why it should be of less moment , indeed , she could not . It was the fatal influences of her childhood working alone . How that day passed , Ellen never knew . She had been too long accustomed to control , to betray her internal suffering ( terror for Edward seemed to endow her with additional self command ) , except by a deadly paleness , which even her aunt at length remarked . It was quite evening , and the party were all scattered , when Mrs. Hamilton discovered Ellen sitting in one of the deep recesses of the windows : her work in her lap , her hands clasped tightly together , and her eyes fixed on the beautiful scenery of the park , but not seeing a single object . "
119718	119734	119708	119708	I	0	" was her aunt 's lively address , as she approached and stood by her . "
119822	119906	119807	119807	I	0	" Ellen looked up in her face ; that kind voice , that affectionate smile , that caressing , constantly - forgiving love , would they again all be forfeited , again give way to coldness , loss of confidence , heightened displeasure ? How indeed she was to act , she knew not ; she only knew there must be concealment , the very anticipation of which , seemed too terrible to bear , and she burst into an agony of tears . "
120104	120191	120196	120196	mamma	3420	" Ellen made a desperate effort , conquered her tears , and tried to converse cheerfully . It was absolute agony to hear Edward 's name , but she nerved herself to do so , to acknowledge she was thinking of him ; and that it was very silly to worry about such a slight wound : and when Mrs. Hamilton proposed that they should walk over to Greville Manor , and tell the good news to Mrs. Greville and Mary , acquiesced with apparent pleasure . "
120210	120226	120205	120205	I	0	" exclaimed Emmeline , springing through the open window , with her usual airy step . "
120243	120244	120247	120247	she	1110	" "
120353	120354	120344	120344	I	0	" "
120362	120363	120368	120368	mamma	3420	" "
120453	120454	120475	120475	mamma	3420	" "
120466	120467	120457	120457	you	3420	" "
120519	120520	120521	120521	You	3420	" "
120536	120541	120530	120530	you	3420	" replied her mother . "
120605	120606	120607	120608	Dear mamma	3422	" "
120618	120627	120610	120610	I	0	" replied Emmeline , instantly self - reproached . "
120651	120652	120644	120644	I	0	" "
120690	121239	121250	121250	Ellen	113	" Days passed , and were each followed by such sleepless feverish nights , that Ellen felt it almost a miracle , that she could so seem , so act , as to excite no notice . The image of her dying mother never left her , night or day , mingled with the horrid scene of her father 's death , and Edward disgraced , expelled , and seeking death by his own hand . There was only one plan that seemed in the least feasible , and that was to send to him , or sell herself the watch she had received on her birthday , and if that was not enough , some few trinkets , which had been her mother 's , and which the last six months her aunt had given into her own care . She ventured casually to inquire if there were any opportunity of sending a parcel to Edward , but the answer was in the negative , and increased her difficulty . The only person she dared even to think of so far intrusting with her deep distress and anxiety for money , but not its cause , was widow Langford , the mother of Robert ( the young gentlemen 's attendant , whom we have had occasion more than once to mention , and the former nurse of all Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton 's children ) . She occupied a cottage on the outskirts of the park , and was not only a favorite with all the young party , Ellen included ( for she generally came to nurse her in her many illnesses ) , but was regarded with the greatest confidence and affection by Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton themselves . They had endeavored to return her unwavering fidelity and active service , by taking her only child Robert into their family , when only seven ; placing him under the immediate charge of Morris , the steward , and of course living in the same house , of his mother also ; and when fifteen , making him personal attendant to Percy and Herbert , who were then about ten and eleven years old . An older and more experienced domestic had , however , accompanied the young men to college , and Robert remained employed in many little confidential services for his master at Oakwood . To widow Langford , Ellen tried to resolve that she would apply , but her fearful state of mental agony had not marked the lapse of time , or had caused her to forget that her letter must be ready in a week . The party were all going a delightful excursion , and to drink tea at Greville Manor , so that they would not be home till quite late ; but in the morning , Ellen , though she had dressed for going out , appeared to have every symptom of such a violent headache , that her aunt advised her remaining quietly at home , and she assented with eagerness , refusing every offer of companionship , saying if the pain went off , she could quite amuse herself , and if it continued , quietness and Ellis 's nursing were the best things for her . "
121286	121302	121274	121274	I	0	" her uncle added , surprised at her exclamation that she had not finished it . "
121391	121477	121366	121366	I	0	" Ellen tried to promise that it should , but her tongue actually clove to the roof of her mouth ; but all the party dispersing at the moment , her silence was unnoticed . Mr. Hamilton gave her his letter , and in half an hour afterward she was alone . She sat for nearly an hour in her own room , with her desk before her , her face buried in her hands , and her whole frame shaking as with an ague . "
121482	121549	121366	121366	I	0	" she said at length , and unlocking a drawer , took thence a small cross , and one or two other trinkets , put them up , and taking off her watch , looked at it with such an expression of suffering , that it seemed as if she could not go on , carefully folded it up with the other trinkets , and murmuring , "
121642	121910	121636	121636	she	3424	" And again she crouched down , cowed by that fearful struggle to the very earth . After a few minutes , it passed , and deliberately putting on her bonnet and shawl , she took up her trinkets , and set off to the widow 's cottage , her limbs so trembling , that she knew not how she should accomplish even that short walk . The wind was unusually high , although the day was otherwise lovely , and she was scarcely able to stand against the strong breeze , especially as every breath seemed to increase the pain in her temples ; but she persisted . The nearest path lay through a thick shrubbery , almost a wood , which the family never used , and , in fact , the younger members were prohibited from taking , but secrecy and haste were all which at that moment entered Ellen 's mind . She felt so exhausted by the wind blowing the branches and leaves noisily and confusedly around , that on reaching a sort of grassy glade , more open than her previous path , she sat down a minute on a mossy stone . The wind blew some withered sticks and leaves toward her , and , among them , two or three soiled pieces of thin paper , stained with damp , one of which she raised mechanically , and started up with a wild cry , and seized the others almost unconsciously . She pressed her hands over her eyes , and her lips moved in the utterance of thanksgiving . "
121923	122262	121915	121917	too!—some guardian angel	2020	" if not actually spoken , were so distinctly uttered in her heart , that she thought she heard them ; and she retraced her steps , so swiftly — so gladly , the very pain and exhaustion were unfelt . She wrote for half an hour intently — eagerly ; though that which she wrote she knew not herself , and never could recall . She took from the secret drawer of her desk ( that secret drawer which , when Percy had so laughingly showed her the secret of its spring , telling her nobody but himself knew it , she little thought she should have occasion so to use ) , some bank notes , of two , three , and five pounds each , making the fifteen she had so carefully hoarded , and placed with them the two she had found . As she did so , she discovered that two had clung so closely together that the sum was five pounds more than she wanted . Still , as acting under the influence of some spell , she carelessly put one aside , sealed up the packet to Edward , inclosed it in her uncle 's to Sir Edward Manly , and dispatched it full four hours before the hour Mr. Hamilton had named . It was gone ; and she sat down to breathe . Some impulse , never experienced before , urged her , instead of destroying Edward 's desperate letter , as she had done similar appeals , to retain it in a blank envelop in that same secret drawer . As she tried to rouse herself from a sort of stupor which was strangely creeping over her , her eye caught the five pound note which she had not had occasion to use , and a thought of such overwhelming wretchedness rushed upon her , as effectually , for the moment , to disperse that stupor , and prostrate her in an agony of supplication before her God . "
122266	122280	122282	122282	I	0	done?"—if her almost maddening thoughts could have found words , such they would have been—"How
122404	123051	123056	123056	Ellen	113	" How long that withering agony lasted , Ellen knew not , nor whether her tears fell , or lay scorching her eyes and heart . The note lay before her like some hideous specter , from which she vainly tried to turn . What could she do with it ? Take it back to the spot where the others had been blown to her ? She tried to rise to do so ; but , to her own terror , she found she was so powerless , that she actually could not walk . With desperate calmness she placed it in the little secret drawer , put up the remainder of her papers , closed and locked her desk , and laid down upon her bed , for she could sit up no longer . Ellis came to her with an inquiry after her head , and if she could take her dinner . Ellen asked for a cup of coffee , and to be left quite quiet instead , as writing had not decreased the pain ; and the housekeeper , accustomed to such casual attacks , did as she was requested , and came frequently to see her in the course of the afternoon and evening ; still without perceiving any thing unusual , and , therefore , not tormenting her with any expression of surprise or anxiety . Thought after thought congregated in the poor girl 's mind , as she thus lay ; so fraught with agony that the physical suffering , which was far more than usual , was unfelt , save in its paralyzing effect on every limb . Her impulse was to confess exactly what she had done to her aunt , the moment she should see her , and conjure her to sentence her to some heavy chastisement , that must deaden her present agony ; but this was impossible without betraying Edward , and nullifying for him the relief she had sent . How could she confess the sin , without the full confession of the use to which that money had been applied ? Whose were the notes ? They were stained with damp , as if they must have lain among those withered leaves some time ; and yet she had heard no inquiry made about them , as the loss of so large a sum would surely have demanded . The only plan she could think of , as bringing the least hope of returning peace , was still to beseech Mrs. Langford to dispose of her watch and trinkets , and the very first mention she heard made of the loss to return the full sum to the real possessor , if possible , so secretly as for it not to be traced to herself . She thought , too , that if she gave her trinkets , one by one , not all together , to Mrs. Langford , it would be less suspicious , and , perhaps , more easily prevail on her to grant her secrecy and assistance ; and if she positively refused , unless Ellen revealed the reason of her desiring their disposal , and would solemnly promise secrecy , she would tell her so much of her intense misery , as might perhaps induce her to give her aid . If she did not demand the reason and betrayed her , she must endure the doubt and serious displeasure such a course of acting on her part would inevitably produce ; but two things alone stood clear before her : she must replace that money — she must keep Edward 's secret . She would have gone that very day to Mrs. Langford , but she could not move , and Ellis , at seven o'clock , prevailed on her to undress and go to bed . "
123077	123141	123058	123058	I	0	" was Mrs. Hamilton 's affectionate address , as she softly entered her niece 's room , on the return of the happy party at eleven at night , and placing the lamp so that the bed remained in shade she could not see any expression in Ellen 's face , except that of suffering , which she naturally attributed to physical pain . "
123230	123546	123547	123547	I	0	" But Ellen would not hear of it ; the pain was not more than she was often accustomed to , she said , and , indeed , she did not mind being alone — though the unusual , almost passionate , warmth with which she returned Mrs. Hamilton 's fond kiss betrayed it was no indifference to the affectionate offer which dictated her refusal . It was well Mrs. Hamilton , though anxious enough to feel the inclination to do so , did not visit her niece again , or the convulsive agony she would have witnessed , the choking sobs which burst forth , a few minutes after she disappeared from Ellen 's sight , would have bewildered and terrified her yet more . Mr. Maitland declared Ellen to be ill of a nervous fever which for three days confined her to her bed , and left her very weak for some little time , and so nervous that the least thing seemed to startle her ; but , as he said it was no consequence , and she would soon recover , Mrs. Hamilton adopted his advice , took no notice of it , and only endeavored to make her niece 's daily routine as varied in employment , though regular in hours and undisturbed in quiet , as she could . Perhaps she would have felt more anxious , and discovered something not quite usual in Ellen 's manner , if her thoughts had not been painfully pre - occupied . About a week after their excursion she entered the library earlier than usual , and found her husband intently engaged with some dispatches just received . She saw he was more than ordinarily disturbed , and hesitated a moment whether to address him ; but he was seldom so engrossed as to be unconscious of the presence of his wife . "
123620	123621	123627	123627	Arthur	84	" "
123640	123703	123633	123633	you	84	" replied his wife very quietly , as she sat down close by him ; but the fiat of separation , the thoughts of a perilous voyage , a visit to an almost desolate island , and the impossibility of receiving regular letters , so crowded upon her all at once , that it was a strong effort to speak at all . "
124104	124105	124096	124096	I	0	" "
124116	124132	124096	124096	I	0	" inquired Mrs. Hamilton , still in that quiet tone , but her lip quivered . "
124213	124214	124195	124195	I	0	" "
124235	124236	124195	124195	I	0	" "
124261	124294	124195	124195	I	0	" replied Mr. Hamilton trying to smile , and folding his arm fondly round his wife , he kissed the cheek which had become pale from the effort to restrain her feelings . "
124376	124377	124384	124384	they	2068	" "
124446	124470	124471	124471	I	0	" she added , raising her head from his shoulder , and smiling cheerfully , even while the tears glistened in her eyes . "
124554	124555	124562	124562	you	0	" "
124575	124598	124562	124562	you	0	" replied her husband , with a fondness , the more intense from the actual veneration that so largely mingled with it . "
124638	125184	125185	125186	Dear papa	845	" Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton remained some hours together that morning in earnest conversation . All of individual regret was conquered for the sake of the other : its expression , at least , not its feeling ; but they understood each other too well , too fondly , to need words or complaints to prove to either how intensely painful was the very thought of separation . To elude the performance of a duty which many persons , unable to enter into the hope of effecting good , would , no doubt , pronounce Quixotic — for what could the poor inhabitants of Samboe be to him?—never entered either Mr. or Mrs. Hamilton 's mind . He was not one to neglect his immediate duties for distant ones ; but believed and acted on the belief , that both could be united . His own large estate , its various farms , parishes , and villages , were so admirably ordered , that he could leave it without the smallest scruple in the hands of his wife and steward . Though interested in , and actually assisting in the political movements of his country , he was still , as from his youth he had firmly resolved to be , a free , independent Englishman ; bound to no party , but respected by all ; retaining his own principles unshaken as a rock , though often and often his integrity had been tried by court bribes and dazzling offers . And yet , rare blending with such individual feelings , Arthur Hamilton looked with candor and kindness on the conduct and principles of others , however they might differ from his own , and found excuses for them , which none others could . That he should give up all the comforts , the luxuries , the delights of his peculiarly happy home , to encounter several months ' sojourn in a bleak , half - civilized island , only in the hope of restoring and insuring moral and religious improvement to a small colony of human beings , whose sole claim upon him was , that they were immortal as himself , and that they had done a kindness to his grandfather more than half a century back , was likely to , and no doubt did , excite the utmost astonishment in very many circles ; but not a sneer , not a word seeming to whisper good should be done at home before sought abroad , could find a moment 's resting - place near Arthur Hamilton 's name . For half an hour after Mrs. Hamilton quitted her husband she remained alone , and when she rejoined her family , though she might have been a shade paler than her wo nt , she was as cheerful in conversation and earnest in manner as usual . That evening Mr. Hamilton informed his children and Miss Harcourt of his intended departure , and consequent compelled change of plan . Emmeline 's burst of sorrow was violent and uncontrolled . Caroline looked for a minute quite bewildered , and then hastening to her father threw one arm round his neck , exclaiming , in a voice of the most affectionate sincerity , "
125200	125201	125202	125204	My dear child	1285	" "
125239	125240	125241	125241	My	0	" "
125252	125253	125249	125249	you	3546	" "
125274	125289	125292	125292	papa	3546	" For a moment an expression of bitter disappointment clouded Caroline 's open countenance . "
125378	125480	125481	125482	Dear Emmeline	78	" Her father almost involuntarily drew her to his heart , and kissed her two or three times , without speaking ; and Caroline was very glad he did so , for when she looked up again , the tears that would come at the first thought of her disappointment were bravely sent back again ; and she tried to cheer Emmeline , by assuring her she never could be like her favorite heroines of romance , if she behaved so very much like a child ; taking the opportunity when they retired for the night , to say more seriously — "
125539	125679	125683	125683	her	80	" Emmeline promised to try ; but her disposition , quite as susceptible to sorrow as to joy , and not nearly as firm as her sister 's , rendered the promise very difficult to fulfill . It was her first sorrow ; and Mrs. Hamilton watched her with some anxiety , half fearful that she had been wrong to shield her so carefully from any thing like grief , if , when it came , she should prove unequal to its firm and uncomplaining endurance . Ellen had been out of the room when Mr. Hamilton had first spoken ; and engaged in soothing Emmeline ; when she re - entered and the news was communicated to her , he did not observe any thing particular in mode of receiving it . But Mrs. Hamilton was so struck with "
125761	125794	125745	125745	she	120	" You will say I am always fancying something extraordinary , Miss Harcourt ; but Ellen certainly did look pleased last night , when mamma told her of papa 's intended departure . "
125795	125811	125813	125814	Miss Harcourt	112	" The expression must have been something extraordinary for you to remark it at all , "
125816	125840	125813	125814	Miss Harcourt	112	" nobody but Mrs. Hamilton , whose penetration is out of the common , can ever read any thing on Ellen 's face . "
125841	125926	125745	125745	she	120	" And it was for that very reason I looked again ; and mamma noticed it too , and was surprised , though she did not say any thing . If she really be pleased , she is most ungrateful , and all her profession of feeling mamma and papa 's constant kindness sheer deceit . I never shall understand Ellen , I believe ; but I do hope mamma will never discover that she is not exactly that which her affection believes her . "
125927	126049	126050	126050	Caroline	120	" Pray do not talk so , my dear Caroline , or I shall be tempted to confess that you are giving words to my own feelings . Her conduct with regard to the disappearance of her allowance , the wholly unsatisfactory account of its expenditure , even every month , for she seems to me to mention many things she has never had , banish every hopeful feeling , and I dread more than I can tell you , the very thing you have expressed . But all this is very wrong ; we have relieved each other by a mutual acknowledgment , and now let us never revert , even in thought , if possible , to the subject . "
126486	126594	126483	126483	his	150	" You are quite right , my dear father ; I was very selfish not to think of it . Trust me for making my dearest mother as cheerful and as happy as I can . You do n't know what a guardian angel the thought of her love has been to me in temptation ; and as for Bertie , if ever I thought he was studying himself ill , and not taking the care of himself he ought , or wanted him to take exercise and recreation , when he thought me a great bore , the word mother , made him yield at once . "
128769	128800	128802	128802	his	209	" Take away the whole , and if he have been unfortunately led into temptation , which I do not believe he has , you expose him to it again , "
128806	128886	128802	128802	his	209	" It is all right he should return it , even though lost only by carelessness ; but I will not have him put to such straits for want of a little money , as must be the case if you deprive him of all his wages ; and now , my good Morris , if you can not in conscience repeat my firm opinion of this lad 's innocence to the servants , I must do it myself . "
129556	129558	129551	129551	his	519	tone—"theft ! "
129891	129906	129907	129908	her mother	345	" Do you wish to both disappoint and displease me , my dear Emmeline ? "
129953	129973	129907	129908	her mother	345	" Indeed , you will do both , if you give way to this most uncalled - for gloom . "
129974	129978	129980	129980	Emmeline	78	" Uncalled for , "
129985	130060	129980	129980	Emmeline	78	" Quite uncalled for , to the extent in which you are indulging it ; and even if called for , do you not think you would be acting more correctly , if you thought more of others than yourself , and tried to become your own cheerful self for their sakes ? It is the first time you have ever given me cause to suspect you of selfishness ; and I am disappointed . "
130061	130080	130081	130081	she	309	" Selfishness , mamma ; and I do hate the thought of it so ! Am I selfish ? "
130096	130202	130081	130081	she	309	" I hope not , my love ; but if you do not try to shake off this depression , we must believe you to be so . Your father 's absence is a still greater trial to Caroline than it is to you , for it compels a very bitter disappointment , as well as the loss of his society ; and yet , though she feels both deeply , she has exerted herself more than I ever saw her do before , and so proves , more than any words or tears could do , how much she loves both him and me . "
130203	130218	130220	130220	Emmeline	78	" And do you think I love you both , less than she does ? "
130226	130273	130220	130220	Emmeline	78	" No , dearest ; but I want you to prove it in the same admirable manner . Do you think I do not feel your father 's absence , Emmeline ? but would you like to see me as sad and changed as you are ? "
130306	130345	130303	130303	she	78	" Dear mamma , do forgive me . I see now I have been very selfish and very weak , but I never , never can be as firm and self - controlled as you and Caroline are . "
130346	130470	130298	130298	her	78	" Do not say never , love , or you will never try to be so . I am quite sure you would not like to be one of those weak , selfish characters , who lay all their faults , and all the mischief their faults produce , on a supposed impossibility to become like others . I know your disposition is naturally less strong and firm than your sister 's , but it is more elastic , and still more joyous ; and so had you not too weakly encouraged your very natural sorrow , you would have been enabled to throw it off , and in the comfort such an exertion would have brought to us , fully recompensed yourself . "
130471	130479	130298	130298	her	78	" And if I do try now ? "
130480	130569	130298	130298	her	78	" I shall be quite satisfied , dearest ; though I fear you will find it more difficult than had you tried a few days ago . Confess that I am right . Did you not , after the first two or three days , feel that you could have been cheerful again , at least at times , but that you fancied you had not felt sorry enough , and so increased both sorrow and anxiety by determinedly dwelling on them , instead of seeking some pursuit ? "
130570	130586	130588	130588	Emmeline	78	" Dear mamma , shall I never be able to hide a feeling from you ? "
130599	130629	130588	130588	Emmeline	78	" I did not know I felt so myself till you put it before me , and now I know that I really did . Was it very wrong ? "
130630	130672	130673	130673	Emmeline	78	" I will answer your question by another , love . Did you find such pertinacious indulgence of gloom , help you to bring the object of your regret and anxiety , and of your own grief before your Heavenly Father ? "
130690	130757	130673	130673	Emmeline	78	" No , mamma ; I could not pray to God to protect dear papa , or to give me His blessing , half as earnestly and believingly as when I was happier ; the more I indulged in gloomy thoughts , the more difficulty I had to turn them to prayer , and the last few days , I fear I have not even tried . "
130758	130969	130588	130588	Emmeline	78	" Then , dearest , is it necessary for me to answer your former question ? I see by that conscious look that it is not . You have always trusted my experience and affection , my Emmeline , trust them now , and try my plan . Think of your dear father , whom you can not love too well , or whose compelled absence really regret too much ; but so think of him , as to pray continually in spirit to your gracious God , to have him always in His holy keeping , either on sea or land , in storm or calm , and so prosper his undertaking , as to permit his return to us still sooner than we at present expect . The very constant prayer for this , will make you rest secure and happy in the belief , that our God is with him wherever he is , as He is with us , and so give you cheerfulness and courage to attend to your daily duties , and conquer any thing like too selfish sorrow . Will you try this , love , even if it be more difficult now , than it would have been a few days ago ? "
130970	130977	130979	130979	she	2231	" I will indeed , mamma , "
130994	131042	130979	130979	she	2231	" When you first addressed me to - day , I thought you were almost harsh , and so cold — so you see even there I was thinking wrong — and now I am glad , oh , so glad , you did speak to me ! "
131043	131102	130984	130984	her	2231	" And I know who will be glad too , if I have prevented his having a Niobe for his Tiny , instead of the Euphrosyne , which I believe he sometimes calls you . I thought there was one particular duet that Percy is to be so charmed with , Emmy . Suppose you try it now . "
131190	131252	131180	131180	Emmeline	78	" Dear Caroline , I have been so pettish and so cross to you since papa left , that I am sure you must be quite tired of me ; but I am going to be really a heroine now , and not a shy sentimental one ; and bear the pain of papa 's absence as bravely as you do . "
131807	131813	131815	131815	Emmeline	78	" Will they never come ? "
131834	131844	131815	131815	Emmeline	78	" it must be past the hour Percy named . "
131845	131853	131855	131856	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" It still wants half an hour , "
131860	131875	131855	131856	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" that unfortunate drawing , when will it succeed in obtaining your undivided attention ? "
131876	131912	131815	131815	Emmeline	78	" Certainly not this evening , mamma ; the only drawing I feel inclined for , is a sketch of my two brothers , if they would only have the kindness to sit by me . "
131913	131917	131919	131919	Caroline	120	" Poor Percy , "
131923	131952	131919	131919	Caroline	120	" if you are to be as restless as you have been the last hour , Emmeline , he would not be very much flattered by his portrait . "
131953	132032	131815	131815	Emmeline	78	" Now that is very spiteful of you , Caroline , and all because I do not happen to be so quiet and sober as you are ; though I am sure all this morning , that mamma thought by your unusually long absence that you were having a most persevering practice , you were only collecting all Percy 's and Herbert 's favorite songs and pieces , and playing them over , instead of your new music . "
132033	132042	131815	131815	Emmeline	78	" And what if I did , Emmeline ? "
132043	132092	131919	131919	Caroline	120	" Why , it only proves that your thoughts are quite as much occupied by them as mine are , though you have so disagreeably read , studied , worked , just as usual , to make one believe you neither thought nor cared any thing about them . "
132093	132159	131815	131815	Emmeline	78	" And so , because Caroline can control even joyous anticipation , she is to be thought void of feeling , Emmy . I really can pronounce no such judgment ; so , though she may have settled to her usual pursuits , and you have literally done nothing at all to - day , I will not condemn her as loving her brothers less . "
132160	132177	132179	132179	Emmeline	78	" But you will condemn me as an idle , unsteady , hair - brained girl , "
132200	132236	132179	132179	Emmeline	78	" Then do let me have a fellow - sufferer , for I can not stand condemnation alone . Ellen , do put away that everlasting sketch , and be idle and unsteady , too ! "
132237	132285	132286	132286	she	78	" It wo n't do , Emmy ; Ellen has been so perseveringly industrious since her illness , that I should rather condemn her for too much application than too great idleness . But you really have been stooping too long this warm evening , my love , "
132315	132377	132308	132308	her	113	" Oblige Emmeline this once , and be as idle as she is : come and talk to me , I have scarcely heard a word from you to - day ; you have been more silent than ever , I think , since your uncle left us ; but I must have no gloom to greet your cousins , Ellen . "
132710	132713	132827	132828	his mother	330	" Herbert ? "
132726	132810	132827	132828	his mother	330	" Is quite well , my dearest mother , and not five minutes ' ride behind me . The villagers would flock round us , with such an hurrah , I thought you must have heard it here ; so I left Bertie to play the agreeable , and promised to see them to - morrow , and galloped on here , for you know the day we left , I vowed that the firstborn of my mother should have her first kiss . "
132811	132825	132827	132828	his mother	330	" Still the same , Percy — not sobered yet , my boy ? "
132871	132884	132885	132885	he	2264	" Sobered ! why , mother , I never intend to be , "
132918	133029	133030	133030	He	2269	" if the venerable towers of that most wise and learned town , Oxford , and all the grave lectures and long faces of sage professors have failed to tame me , there can be no hope for my sobriety ; but here comes Herbert , actually going it almost as fast as I did . Well done , my boy ! Mother , that is all your doing ; he feels your influence at this distance . Why , all the Oxonians would fancy the colleges must be tumbling about their ears , if they saw the gentle , studious , steady Herbert Hamilton riding at such a rate . "
133567	133572	133574	133574	Caroline	120	" Even mamma 's ! "
133578	133622	133574	133574	Caroline	120	" No ; but she is the only sensible person among us , for she has not said any thing about it , and , therefore , I dare say does not even see that which we are making such a wonder about . "
133623	133684	133543	133543	she	113	" I do not agree with you , for I rather think she has both seen and felt it before either of us , and that because it so grieves and perplexes her , she can not speculate or even speak about it as we do . Time will explain it , I suppose , but it is very disagreeable . "
134060	134071	134072	134072	he	81	" I may thank our Percy for this excellent friend , "
134075	134155	134072	134072	he	81	" He tells me his brave and honest avowal of those verses , which had given him so much pain , attracted him more toward me and mine , than even my own efforts to obtain his friendship . Percy little thought when he so conquered himself the help he would give his father — so little do we know to what hidden good , the straightforward , honest performance of a duty , however painful , may lead . "
134156	134168	134170	134170	Percy	99	" My father should thank you , mother , not me , "
134193	134246	134185	134186	his mother	330	" No such thing , Percy ; I will not have you give me all the merit of your good deeds . I did but try to guide you , my boy ; neither the disposition to receive , nor the fruit springing from the seeds I planted , is from me . "
134247	134263	134265	134265	he	99	" They are , mother , more than you are in the least aware of ! "
134283	134522	134265	134265	he	99	" I thought I knew all your worth before I went to Oxford , but I have mingled with the world now ; I have been a silent listener and observer of such sentiments , such actions , as I know would naturally have been mine , and though in themselves perhaps of little moment , saw they led to irregularity , laxity of principle and conduct , which now I can not feel as other than actual guilt ; and what saved me from the same ? The principle which from my infancy you taught . I have questioned , led on in conversation , these young men to speak of their boyhood and their homes , and there were none guided , loved as I was ; none whose parents had so blended firmness with indulgence , as while my wild , free spirits were unchecked , prevented the ascendency of evil . I could not do as they did . Mother ! love you more , perhaps , I can not , but every time I join the world , fresh from this home sanctuary , I must bless and venerate you more ! To walk through this world with any degree of security , man must have principle based on the highest source ; and that principle can only be instilled by the constant example of a mother and the association of a home ! "
135037	135109	135110	135110	Ellen	113	" Nelly , Tiny wrote me such a description of your birthday watch , that I quite forgot , I have been dying to see it all the time I have been at home ; show it me now , there 's a dear ; it can not be much use to you , that 's certain , for I have never seen you take it from its hiding - place . "
135127	135173	135120	135120	her	113	" Not in your power ! You must be dreaming , Nell , as I think you are very often now . Why , what do you wear that chain , and seal and key for , if you have not your watch on too ? "
135174	135200	135202	135203	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Where is your watch , Ellen ? and why , if you are not wearing it , do you make us suppose you are ? "
135239	135257	135235	135235	he	99	" Did you hear my mother speak to you , Ellen ? Why do n't you answer ? "
135258	135281	135295	135295	she	113	" Because I thought my watch was my own to do what I liked with , to wear or to put away , "
135319	135341	135343	135343	Percy	99	" How dare you answer so , Ellen ? Leave the room , or ask my mother 's pardon at once , "
135380	135429	135366	135366	she	113	" Stay , Ellen ; this extraordinary conduct must not go on any longer without notice on my part . I have borne with it , I fear , too long already . Leave us , my dear Percy ; I would rather speak with your cousin alone . "
135430	135462	135463	135463	He	99	" I fear it will be useless , mother ; what has come over Ellen I can not imagine , but I never saw such an incomprehensible change in my life . "
135499	135511	135514	135514	her	113	" Do not go , Percy , for pity 's sake ! "
135749	135979	135980	135980	She	2320	" That you are under the evil influence of some unconfessed and most heinous fault , Ellen , I am perfectly convinced ; what it is time will reveal . I give you one month to decide on your course of action ; subdue this sullen spirit , confess whatever error you may have been led into , and so change your conduct as to be again the child I so loved , spite of occasional faults and errors , and I will pardon all that is past . If , at the end of a month , I find you persisting in the same course of rebellion and defiance , regardless alike of your duty to your God and to me , I shall adopt some measures to compel submission . I had hoped to bring up all my children under my own eye , and by my own efforts ; but if I am not permitted so to do , I know my duty too well to shrink from the alternative . You will no longer remain under my care ; some severer guardian and more rigid discipline may bring you to a sense of your duty . I advise you to think well on this subject , Ellen ; you know me too well , I think , to imagine that I speak in mere jest . "
137111	137125	137138	137138	Robert	102	" Why , there is one of them ! I am so glad , "
137182	137207	137210	137211	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" What is the matter , Robert ? what have you found to cause such contradictory exclamations ? Speak , for God 's sake ! "
137292	137334	137283	137283	him	102	" Nothing , madam , indeed it can be nothing — I must be mistaken — I am acting like a fool this afternoon , doing the most unheard - of mischief , and then frightening you and myself at shadows . "
137335	137355	137356	137356	He	102	" This evasion will not do , Robert ; give me the papers at which you were so startled . "
137466	137469	137463	137464	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Robert ! "
137519	137593	137499	137499	he	102	" It is not at all necessary , my good boy ; I am perfectly well . This is , I believe , the only note that can be identified as one of those you lost ; these smaller ones ( she pointed to three , of one , two , and four pounds each , which Ellen had received at long intervals from Mrs. Langford ) have nothing to do with it ? "
137594	137606	137499	137499	he	102	" No , madam , and that — that may not — "
137607	137708	137499	137499	he	102	" We can not doubt it , Robert , I have its number ; I need not detain you , however , any longer . Take care of these broken fragments , and if they can be repaired , see that it is done . Here is Miss Hamilton 's note and parcel . I believe you are to wait for an answer , at all events inquire . I need not ask you to be silent on this discovery , till I have spoken to Miss Fortescue , or to trust my promise to make your innocence fully known . "
137709	137768	137774	137774	his	2355	" Not by the exposure of Miss Ellen ! Oh , madam , this is but one of them , the smallest one — it may have come to her by the merest chance — see how stained it is with damp — for the sake of mercy , oh , madam , spare her and yourself too ! "
137801	137843	137795	137796	His mistress	2340	" It is a kind thought , Robert , and if justice to you and mercy to the guilty can , by any extenuating clause unknown to me now , be united , trust me , they shall . Now go . "
138203	138232	138233	138233	he	99	" I shall wish Morris and all his concerns at the bottom of the Dart , if he is so to engross my mother when I want her , "
138369	138410	138362	138362	his	102	" Forgive me , dearest mother ; I ought not , perhaps , to ask , but I am sure something is wrong . You are ill — anxious — may I not share it ? Can I do nothing ? "
138411	138429	138362	138362	his	102	" Nothing , my Herbert ; bless you for your watchful love — it is such comfort . "
138470	138523	138466	138466	she	330	" Do not look so anxious , dear boy , I am not ill — not quite happy , perhaps , but we know where to look for strength to bear trial , Herbert . Wait tea for me till eight o'clock ; it is probable I may be engaged till then ; "
138954	138975	138976	138976	she	2381	" I desired your presence , Ellen , because I wished to speak to you ; come here without any more delay,"—how
139049	139101	139007	139007	she	2381	" Ellen ! is it necessary for me to tell you why you are here — necessary to produce the proof that my words are right , and that you have been influenced by the fearful effects of some unconfessed and most heinous sin ? Little did I dream its nature . "
139144	139300	139119	139119	she	113	" Is it true — can it be true — that you , offspring of my own sister , dear to me , cherished by me as my own child — you have been the guilty one to appropriate , and conceal the appropriation of money , which has been a source of distress by its loss , and the suspicion thence proceeding , for the last seven weeks?—that you could listen to your uncle 's words , absolving his whole household as incapable of a deed which was actual theft , and yet , by neither word nor sign , betray remorse or guilt?—could behold the innocent suffering , the fearful misery of suspicion , loss of character , without the power of clearing himself , and stand calmly , heedlessly by — only proving by your hardened and rebellious temper that all was not right within — Ellen , can this be true ? "
139301	139304	139317	139317	her	113	" Yes ! "
139326	139351	139317	139317	her	113	" thank God , that it is known ! I dared not bring down the punishment on myself ; but I can bear it . "
139352	139386	139387	139387	Ellen	113	" This is mere mockery , Ellen ; how dare I believe even this poor evidence of repentance , with the recollection of your past conduct ? What were the notes you found ? "
139391	139403	139404	139404	Ellen	113	" Where are they?—This is but one , and the smallest . "
139411	139419	139404	139404	Ellen	113	" Used them — and for what ? "
139441	139451	139437	139437	She	2386	" How long have they been in your possession ? "
139452	139458	139317	139317	her	113	" Five or six weeks ; "
139473	139486	139437	139437	She	2386	" Since Robert told his story to your uncle , or before ? "
139487	139490	139317	139317	her	113	" Before . "
139491	139539	139540	139540	Ellen	113	" Then your last answer was a falsehood , Ellen ; it is full seven weeks since my husband addressed the household on the subject . You could not have so miscounted time , with such a deed to date by . Where did you find them ? "
139545	139614	139540	139540	Ellen	113	" And what business had you there ? You know that neither you nor your cousins are ever allowed to go that way to Mrs. Langford 's cottage , and more especially alone . If you wanted to see her , why did you not go the usual way ? And when was this?—you must remember the exact day . Your memory is not in general so treacherous . "
139620	139626	139627	139627	She	113	" Have you forgotten it ? "
139642	139645	139627	139627	She	113	" No . "
139646	139677	139627	139627	She	113	" Then answer me , Ellen , this moment , and distinctly ; for what purpose were you seeking Mrs. Langford 's cottage by that forbidden path , and when ? "
139678	139773	139627	139627	She	113	" I wanted money , and I went to ask her to take my trinkets — my watch , if it must be — and dispose of them as I had read of others doing , as miserable as I was ; and the wind blew the notes to my very hand , and I used them . I was mad then — I have been mad since , I believe ; but I would have returned the whole amount to Robert , if I could but have parted with my trinkets in time . "
139851	139872	139874	139874	she	2389	" And when was this , Ellen ? I will have no more evasion — tell me the exact day . "
139939	140332	139932	139932	Ellen	113	" You can not imagine , Ellen , that this half - confession will either satisfy me , or in the smallest degree redeem your sin . One and one only path is open to you ; for all that you have said and left unsaid but deepens your apparent guilt , and so blackens your conduct , that I can scarcely believe I am addressing the child I so loved — and could still so love , if but one real sign be given of remorse and penitence — one hope of returning truth . But that sign , that hope , can only be a full confession . Terrible as is the guilt of appropriating so large a sum , granted it came by the merest chance into your hand ; dark as is the additional sin of concealment when an innocent person was suffering — something still darker , more terrible , must lie concealed behind it , or you would not , could not , continue thus obdurately silent . I can believe that under some heavy pressure of misery , some strong excitement , the sum might have been used without thought , and that fear might have prevented the confession of any thing so dreadful ; but what was this heavy necessity for money , this strong excitement ? What fearful and mysterious difficulties have you been led into to call for either ? Tell me the truth , Ellen , the whole truth ; let me have some hope of saving you and myself the misery of publicly declaring you the guilty one , and so proving Robert 's innocence . Tell me what difficulty , what misery so maddened you , as to demand the disposal of your trinkets . If there be the least excuse , the smallest possibility of your obtaining in time forgiveness , I will grant it . I will not believe you so utterly fallen . I will do all I can to remove error , and yet to prevent suffering ; but to win this , I must have a full confession — every question that I put to you must be clearly and satisfactorily answered , and so bring back the only comfort to yourself , and hope to me . Will you do this , Ellen ? "
140333	140340	140349	140350	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Oh , that I could ! "
140354	140463	140349	140350	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" But I can not — must not — dare not . Aunt Emmeline , hate me , condemn me to the severest , sharpest suffering ; I wish for it , pine for it : you can not loathe me more than I do myself , but do not — do not speak to me in these kind tones — I can not bear them . It was because I knew what a wretch I am , that I have so shunned you , I was not worthy to be with you ; oh , sentence me at once ! I dare not answer as you wish . "
140464	140468	140470	140471	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Dare not ! "
140498	140666	139932	139932	Ellen	113	" You dare commit a sin , from which the lowest of my household would shrink in horror , and yet tell me you dare not make the only atonement , give me the only proof of real penitence I demand . This is a weak and wicked subterfuge , Ellen , and will not pass with me . There can be no reason for this fearful obduracy , not even the consciousness of greater guilt , for I promise forgiveness , if it be possible , on the sole condition of a full confession . Once more , will you speak ? Your hardihood will be utterly useless , for you can not hope to conquer me ; and if you permit me to leave you with your conduct still clothed in this impenetrable mystery , you will compel me to adopt measures to subdue that defying spirit , which will expose you and myself to intense suffering , but which must force submission at last . "
140667	140682	140684	140684	Ellen	113	" You can not inflict more than I have endured the last seven weeks , "
140689	140701	140684	140684	Ellen	113	" I have borne that , I can bear the rest . "
140702	140790	139932	139932	Ellen	113	" Then you will not answer ? You are resolved not to tell me the day on which you found that money , the use to which it was applied , the reason of your choosing that forbidden path , permitting me to believe you guilty of heavier sins than may be the case in reality . Listen to me , Ellen ; it is more than time this interview should cease , but I will give you one chance more . It is now half - past seven,"—she
140803	140890	140684	140684	Ellen	113	table—"I will remain here one half - hour longer : by that time this sinful temper may have passed away , and you will consent to give me the confession I demand . I can not believe you so altered in two months as to choose obduracy and misery , when pardon , and in time confidence and love , are offered in their stead . Get up from that crouching posture , it can be but mock humility , and so only aggravates your sin . "
141043	141068	141031	141031	she	113	" Breathe it to my uncle or aunt , for if she knows it he will , and you will never see me more . "
141764	141888	141756	141756	her	113	" Aunt Emmeline , aunt Emmeline , speak to me but one word , only one word of kindness before you go . I do not ask for mercy , there can be none for such a wretch as I am ; I will bear without one complaint , one murmur , all you may inflict — you can not be too severe . Nothing can be such agony as the utter loss of your affection ; I thought , the last two months , that I feared you so much that it was all fear , no love , but now , now that you know my sin , it has all , all come back to make me still more wretched . "
141937	142008	142009	142009	Ellen	113	" Will you confess , Ellen , if I stay ? Will you give me the proof that it is such agony to lose my affection , that you do love me as you profess , and that it is only one sin which has so changed you ? One word , and , tardy as it is , I will listen , and , if I can , forgive . "
142396	142400	142402	142402	Percy	99	" At length ! "
142434	142459	142402	142402	Percy	99	" Mother , I really did begin to think you intended to punish my impatience by not joining us at all to - night . "
142460	142481	142483	142483	her	488	" I did not know you were impatient , my dear boy , or perhaps I might have done so ! "
142491	142519	142483	142483	her	488	" I fear , indeed , waiting for me so long after a water - excursion , must have caused you to be impatient in another sense . "
142520	142573	142402	142402	Percy	99	" What ! that we must be all famished ? I assure you , we are , and the loss of your society sharpened the pangs of hunger I owe Morris a grudge , and will certainly serve him out one day , for detaining you so long when I wanted you . "
142574	142583	142585	142586	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" It was not Morris that detained me , "
142591	142611	142612	142612	she	2419	" I had done with him by six o'clock ; but come , tell me something about your excursion , "
142638	142707	142627	142628	Miss Harcourt	112	" How did your boat go , and how did Caroline 's voice and your flute sound on the water , Percy ? Herbert , I see , has found poetry , as usual , and made Miss Harcourt his companion ; you must tell me what verses our beautiful river recalled this afternoon ; and you , Emmy , have you any more sketches to fill up ? "
142845	142884	142841	142841	Caroline	120	" What has become of Ellen ? I had quite forgotten her till this moment ; how neglectful she will think us ! Do ring the bell , Percy , that we may send and let her know . "
142885	142907	142909	142909	Percy	99	" If she has no recollection of meal - time , I really think we need not trouble ourselves about her , "
142979	142995	142996	142996	she	330	" You need not , Percy ; your cousin will not wish to join us , "
143047	143089	143040	143040	his	99	" Mother dearest ! what has happened?—that unhappy girl again ! I am sure it is . Why do you not cast her off from your heart at once ; she will bring you nothing but sorrow for all your love . "
143090	143102	143104	143104	Emmeline	78	" Percy , how can you be so harsh?—how unlike you ! "
143130	143170	143124	143124	her	330	" We have all given mamma trouble and pain enough one time or other , and what would have become of us if she had cast us off ? and Ellen has no mother , too — for shame ! "
143171	143174	143176	143176	Percy	99	" Hush ! "
143194	143218	143219	143219	he	99	" This is no light or common matter , to affect my mother thus . Shall we send for Mr. Howard , mother ? "
143224	143244	143219	143219	he	99	" in my father 's absence he is your ablest friend — we can only feel , not counsel . "
143576	143584	143585	143586	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Do not weep thus , love , "
143643	143724	143741	143741	he	99	" Ellen is still very young , and though she is giving us all this misery and disappointment now , she may become all we can wish her , by - and - by . We must not give up all hope , because now all my cares seem so blighted . There is some fatal mystery attached to her conduct ; for I am indeed deceived if she is not very wretched and there is some hope in that . "
143725	143733	143735	143735	Percy	99	" Then why does she not speak ? "
143766	143842	143750	143750	he	99	" What but the most determined hardihood and wickedness can keep her silent , when you promise forgiveness if she will but speak ? What mystery can there , or ought there , to be about her , when she has such an indulgent friend as yourself to bring all her troubles to ? Wretched ! I hope she is , for she deserves to be , if it were only for her base ingratitude . "
143843	143858	143860	143860	Herbert	102	" Percy ! dear Percy ! do not speak and judge so very harshly , "
143866	143908	143860	143860	Herbert	102	" there does , indeed , seem no excuse for her conduct , but if we ever should find that there is some extenuating cause , how unhappy we shall be for having judged her still more harshly than she deserved . "
143909	143918	143920	143920	Percy	99	" It is impossible we can do that , "
143927	143990	143860	143860	Herbert	102	" Nothing but guilt can be the cause of her keeping any thing from my mother . Ellen knows , as we all know , that even error when confessed , has always been forgiven , sorrow always soothed , and every difficulty removed . What can her silence spring from , then , but either defying obstinacy or some blacker sin ? "
143991	144000	144002	144002	Caroline	120	" It does seem like it , unhappily , "
144021	144053	144013	144013	she	120	" but she can not persevere in it long . Dear mamma , do not look so distressed : it is impossible she can resist you for any length of time . "
144054	144092	143860	143860	Herbert	102	" She has resisted every offer of kindness , my dear child , and it is the difficulty as to what course to pursue , to compel submission and confession , that so grieves and perplexes me . "
144093	144103	144105	144105	Herbert	102	" Let me seek Mr. Howard , dearest mother , "
144107	144144	144105	144105	Herbert	102	" he is so good , so kind , even in his severest judgments , that I really think Ellen will scarcely be able to persevere in her mistaken silence , if he speak to her . "
144154	144232	144145	144146	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" I believe you are right , Herbert . If I must have counsel out of my own family , I can not go to a kinder , wiser , or more silent friend . If the fearful shame which I must inflict on Ellen to - night of proving Robert 's innocence before my whole household , by the denouncement of her guilt , have no effect in softening her , I will appeal to him . "
144233	144253	144255	144255	Emmeline	78	" Oh , mamma , must this be — can you not , will you not spare her this ? "
144266	144288	144255	144255	Emmeline	78	" it would kill me , I know it would . Do not — do not expose her to such shame . "
144289	144320	144322	144322	Percy	99	" Do you think it is no suffering to my mother to be called upon to do this , Emmeline , that you add to it by this weak interference ? "
144332	144351	144322	144322	Percy	99	" Shame ! she has shamed us all enough . There wants little more to add to it . "
144395	144453	144390	144390	she	345	" One word of confession — one evidence that her sin originated in a momentary temptation , that it conceals nothing darker — one real proof of penitence , and God knows how gladly I would have spared myself and her ; but as it is , Lucy , Emmeline , do not make my duty harder . "
144550	144565	144567	144567	Fanny	170	" Tell Miss Fortescue that we are only waiting for her to commence prayers ; "
144708	144716	144717	144717	she	78	" Before we part for the night , "
144727	144987	144717	144717	she	78	" it is necessary that the innocent should be so justified before you all , that he should no longer be injured by suspicion and avoidance . It is nearly two months since your master assured you of his own and of my perfect conviction that Robert Langford had told the truth , and that the missing notes had been unfortunately lost by him ; not appropriated , as I fear most of you have believed , and are still inclined to do . The complete failure of every search for them has induced a very uncomfortable feeling among you all as to the person on whom suspicion of finding and appropriating them might fall , none but the household frequenting that particular path , and none being able to suppose that the storm could have so dispersed as to lose all trace of them . I acknowledge it was unlikely , but not so unlikely as that Robert Langford should have failed in honesty , or that any of my household should have appropriated or concealed them . All mystery is now , however , at an end ; the missing notes have been traced and found ; and that all suspicion and discomfort may be removed from among you , it becomes my duty to designate the individual who has thus transgressed every duty to God and man , not by the sin alone , but by so long permitting the innocent to suffer for the guilty , more especially as that individual is one of my own family"—for
145011	145014	144990	144990	she	2455	tell—"Ellen Fortescue ! "
145630	145667	145616	145616	her	2340	" God bless you , Morris ! I ought to have known your love for your master 's house would have urged this , without any request from me . I can not thank you enough . "
145927	145935	145936	145936	he	134	" This rebellious spirit must be conquered , "
145966	146111	145936	145936	he	134	" We should actually be sharing her sin , if we permit her to conquer us by obduracy and self - will . Solitary confinement and complete idleness may bring her to a better temper , and , in fact , should be persisted in , till a full confession be made . If that fail , my dear Mrs. Hamilton , your niece should be banished from Oakwood . She must not remain here , a continual source of anxiety and misery to you , and of successful hardihood to herself ; but of that there will be time enough to think when you have an answer from Mr. Hamilton ; his judgment from a distance may be wiser than ours on the spot , and irritated as we are by such unaccountable obstinacy in one we have always thought almost too yielding . "
146473	146524	146525	146525	she	2509	" She will , of course , join us in the hours of devotion , though not occupying her usual place , for she who has lowered herself , in the sight of God and man , beneath the humblest of my domestics , may no longer kneel above them , "
146530	146617	146525	146525	she	2509	" But of my determination on that point she is already aware ; and she will go with us as usual to church ; I will have no remark made , further than I can avoid . Be as kind to her as you can , Ellis , consistent with your character as a wise and watchful guardian . God in mercy grant that her heart may be so softened , that you will not fill that painful position long . And now to see her . "
146689	146756	146685	146685	he	99	" Mother , you shall not see Ellen any more alone ! she has made you miserable enough already , and each time that she sees you , her deceitful appearance of remorse and suffering , for they can not be real , or she would speak , but add to it ; send for her here , and tell her your decision before us all . "
146952	147053	146948	146948	Ellen	113	" Oh , aunt Emmeline , in mercy spare him ! do not , oh , do not throw such shame upon him , he who is so brave , admired , honored ! do not , oh , if you have any pity left , do not make him hate me , loathe me too , my own only brother ! he must throw me off . How can he bear such shame upon his name ! Oh , do with me more than you have said , any thing , every thing , but that . Spare him ! "
147054	147059	147061	147061	Percy	99	" Spare him yourself , "
147110	147217	147218	147218	Ellen	113	spoiling).—"If the knowledge of your sin make him miserable , as it must , be yourself the one to save him — you alone can . Speak — break this determined and most guilty silence , and his influence will not be needed , and my mother will be silent to him concerning what has passed , now and forever , as we will all . If you so love him , spare him the shame you have brought on all of us ; if not , it is mere words , as must be the love you have professed all these years for my mother . "
147257	147401	147251	147252	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" I can not grant your request , Ellen , for to refuse it , appears to me the only means of softening you . It may be a full fortnight before I can write to Edward , for we must receive letters first . If during that interval you choose to give me the only proof of repentance that can satisfy me , or bring the least hope of returning happiness to yourself , I shall now know how to act . I would indeed spare your brother this bitter shame , but if you continue thus obdurate , no entreaties will move me . Rise , and go with Ellis . Punishment and misery , repentance and pardon , are all before you ; you alone can choose . I shall interfere no more , till your uncle 's sentence comes . "
148152	148169	148170	148171	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Would it not go far to prove she really did wish to return the money ? "
148192	148262	148170	148171	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Was it to return the fatally appropriated sum , or because she needed more ? Ellen had so positively , and with such agony asserted the first , that it was scarcely possible to disbelieve her ; but what was this fearful difficulty , this pressing demand by one so young for so much money ? Why , if it were comparatively innocent , would she not speak ? "
149605	149631	149632	149632	she	211	" if a branch were in the slightest degree decayed , cut it off ; if the blight extend to the root , destroy it , "
149937	149949	149951	149951	Emmeline	78	" If she did but know her , she must speak , "
149955	149978	149951	149951	Emmeline	78	" I did not feel quite sure that I was my own happy self , all the time she was with us . "
149979	150003	150005	150005	Percy	99	" The atmosphere was frozen twenty degrees below zero in all the rooms she frequented , though it was otherwise a hot summer , "
150007	150012	150005	150005	Percy	99	" and in Yorkshire — "
150013	150052	150054	150054	Herbert	197	" Pray do not joke , dear Percy ; I can not bear to think of Ellen going away from us at all , much less to such a guardian , though I know she is very good , "
150056	150118	150054	150054	Herbert	197	" Now , my good fellow , do not attempt to say a word for Nancy Seldon ; she was the only person in the world I ever heard you acknowledge you disliked ; so what must she be ? Worthy ! no doubt , or my father would not have trusted Ellen to her , but for any thing else — "
150119	150134	150136	150136	Caroline	120	" Poor Ellen ! she little knows to what her obstinacy is condemning her , "
150138	150166	150136	150136	Caroline	120	" I wish she did and then she might spare herself and mamma , too ; though I fear even confession would not help her much now . "
150997	151013	150979	150979	she	113	" No cause can be excusing enough to justify the entire setting aside this sentence , "
151082	151419	151079	151079	she	367	impressively—"I can scarcely hope , Ellen , that as even the idea of sparing your only brother shame and misery , on his return home , expecting nothing but joy , after nearly three years ' separation and exposure to danger , has had no effect in softening you , that your uncle 's sentence will . Once I should have believed that only the thought of leaving me , and going to the care of a stranger , would have urged you to speak directly . I can believe this no longer ; but as I wish you to be with Edward , at least part of his stay with us , I shall postpone your leaving us , one month from to - day . If , indeed , Edward 's influence be such that , for his sake , you will make me a full confession and answer clearly and distinctly every question I put to you , your residence with Miss Seldon shall be limited to three , six , ten , or twelve months , according to the nature of the motive of this incomprehensible and , apparently most sinful conduct . If you leave us still obdurate , years will , in all probability , pass before we can feel sufficiently confident in the restored integrity and openness of your character to permit your return to us . The pain you are inflicting upon me it is useless to dwell upon . As the child of my only and most dearly loved sister , I have loved you , hoped for you , with little less intensity of affection than that I have borne toward my own ; for I felt that , with the sole exception of your brother , I was the only being you had on earth united to you by ties of blood . How this conduct repays my love and care you must answer to yourself ; I can only be sensible of bitter disappointment . "
151492	151558	151489	151489	she	2594	" If you are determined not to speak , Ellen , you may retire . I have told you all I wished to say , except that till you leave us though you will still occupy your present rooms , and be still under Ellis 's care , you are at liberty to employ yourself , and go about the house and grounds as usual . "
151678	151690	151692	151692	Ellis	135	" I knew it would break her heart , poor lamb ! "
151704	151728	151692	151692	Ellis	135	" thank God , thank God ! Master Edward 's coming home , and that she is not to go till he does . "
151729	151739	151752	151752	she	733	" Have you so much confidence in his influence ? "
151775	151785	151752	151752	she	733	" God in mercy grant you may be right ! "
151786	151793	151801	151801	she	135	" Right ? Dear my lady ! "
151808	151877	151801	151801	she	135	" I would stake your confidence in me , which is all my life 's worth , if Master Edward is not at the bottom of it all , and that this poor child is sacrificing herself for some fancied danger to him ! I saw enough of that work when they were young children , and I have noticed enough since she has been under my care . "
151878	151881	151883	151884	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Edward ! "
151901	151920	151883	151884	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Edward ! bearing the high character he does ; what can he have to do with it ? "
151921	152028	152029	152029	she	2601	" I do n't know , my lady , but I am sure he has . Young men , ay , some of the finest and bravest among us , get into difficulties sometimes , and it do n't touch their characters as their officers see them , and Master Edward was always so terrified at the mere thought of my master knowing any of his faults ; but — hush ! we must not let her know we suspect any thing , poor lamb ; it will make her still more miserable . You are better now , dear Miss Ellen , are you not ? "
152102	152122	152090	152090	her	113	" I am better , dear aunt , much better ; I dare say I shall soon be well . "
152164	152171	152172	152172	she	113	" I forgot — forgive me , "
152180	152208	152217	152217	she	2605	" Ellen , my dear Ellen ! why will you persist in making yourself and me so miserable , when a few words would make us happier ? "
152222	152255	152257	152257	Ellis	135	" Do not urge her now , dear my lady , she is not well enough ; give her till Master Edward comes ; I am sure she will not resist him , "
152363	152505	152353	152353	her	113	" Take me away — take me away , dear Ellis ; I can not bear this room — it seems all full of misery ! and I loved it so once , and I shall love it again , when I am miles and miles away , and can not see it — nor any one belonging to it . Oh , Ellis , Ellis ! I knew you were too kind . I was too glad and contented to be with you ; it was not punishment enough for my sin — and I must go away — and I shall never , never see my aunt again — I know I shall not . Oh ! if I might but die first ! but I am too wicked for that ; it is only the good that die . "
153193	153203	153181	153181	She	2608	" Thank God , Master Edward 's coming home ! "
153543	153655	153521	153521	he	99	" Good - by , dear Ellis . I wonder if I shall ever feel myself a man when talking to you . How many tricks I have played you in this room , and you were always so good - natured , even when one of my seat - crackers set your best gown on fire , and quite spoiled it ; do you remember it ? I do think you were nearly angry then , and quite enough to make you ; and papa made me save up my money to buy you a new dress . I did not play such a practical joke in a hurry again . "
153674	153684	153685	153685	she	2639	" You have forgotten your cousin , Mr. Percy , "
153694	153713	153715	153715	his	2638	" When she remembers her duty to my mother , I will remember that she is my cousin , "
153767	153803	153749	153749	he	2638	" God bless you , dear Ellen ! I hope you will be happier when we meet again , and that it will not be so long before we do , as we fancy now ; "
153898	153949	153894	153894	Percy	99	" I am a brute , Ellen , nothing less ; forgive me , and say good - by . I ca n't understand it at all , but angry as I am with you , your pale face haunts me like a specter , so we must part friends ; "
154946	154966	154940	154940	she	113	" My dear Ellen , what is it ? You have been sleeping uncomfortably — surely you know me ? "
154967	155019	155021	155021	she	113	" I thought I was at — at — Seldon Grange — are you sure I am not ? Dear aunt Emmeline , do tell me I am at Oakwood , I know I am to go , and very soon ; but I am not there now , am I ? "
155062	155105	155057	155057	her	113	" No , love , you are with me still at Oakwood , and you will not go from me till you have been with Edward some little time . You can not think I would send you away now , Ellen ? "
155129	155148	155126	155126	she	113	" He will never come — I know he will never come — my sin has killed him ! "
155149	155164	155126	155126	she	113	" Your sin , Ellen , what can that have to do with Edward ? "
155165	155168	155126	155126	she	113	" Because , "
155171	155176	155126	155126	she	113	" it was for him "
155195	155254	155126	155126	she	113	continued—"Nothing , nothing , indeed , with him — what could it have ? But if he knows it — oh , it will so grieve him ; perhaps it would be better I should go before he comes — and then , then , he need not know it ; if , indeed , he ever comes . "
155255	155339	155194	155194	she	113	" I do not think you quite know what you are saying , my dear Ellen ; your uncomfortable dream has unsettled you . Try and keep quiet for an hour , and you will be better . Remember , suffering as this dreadful suspense is , your brother is still in a Father 's gracious keeping ; and that He will listen to your prayers for his safety , and if it be His good pleasure , still restore him to you . "
155340	155344	155346	155346	Ellen	113	" My prayers , "
155350	155376	155346	155346	Ellen	113	" Mr. Howard said , there was a barrier between Him and me , while I would not confess ; I had refused His mercy . "
155377	155415	155126	155126	she	113	" Can you confess before God , Ellen ? Can you lay your whole heart open before Him , and ask Him in his infinite mercy , and for your Saviour 's sake , to forgive you ? "
155416	155425	155427	155427	Ellen	113	" I could , and did do so , "
155453	155533	155439	155439	her	113	" but Mr. Howard told me it was a mockery and sin to suppose God would hear me or forgive me while I refused to obey Him , by being silent and obdurate to you . That if I wished His forgiveness , I must prove it by telling the whole to you , whom His commandments desired me to obey , and — and — as I dared not do that , I have been afraid to pray . "
155555	155631	155439	155439	her	113	" And is it impossible , quite impossible that you can confide the source of your grief and difficulty to me , Ellen ? Will you not do so , even if I promise forgiveness , not merely to you , but to all who may have erred ? Answer me , my sweet child ; your silence is fearfully injuring your mind and body . Why do you fancy you dare not tell me ? "
155632	155640	155642	155642	Ellen	113	" Because , because I have promised ! "
155672	155739	155439	155439	her	113	" Aunt Emmeline — oh , do not , pray do not speak to me in that kind tone ! be harsh and cold again , I can bear it better . If you did but know how my heart and brain ache — how they long to tell you and so rest — but I can not — I dare not — I have promised . "
155740	155752	155754	155755	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" And you may not tell me whom you have promised ? "
155780	155805	155807	155807	Ellen	113	" Mamma — I promised her , and she stands by me so pale , so grieved , whenever I think of telling you , "
155825	155935	155940	155940	she	2663	" I thought I must have told you , when you said I was to go — to go to Seldon Grange — but she stood by me and laid her hand on my head , and it was so cold , so heavy , I do n't remember any thing more till I found you and Ellis leaning over me ; but I ought not to tell you even this . I know I ought not — for look — look , aunt Emmeline!—don't you see mamma — there — quite close to me ; oh , tell her to forgive me — I will keep my promise , "
156060	156101	156054	156054	she	113	" It is not reality , love ; if she could see and speak to you , I am sure it would be to tell you to confide all your sorrow to me , if it would make you happier . "
156102	156235	156054	156054	she	113	" Oh , no , no — I should be very wicked if it made me happier ; I ought not even to wish to tell you . But Mr. Myrvin told me , even when mamma went to Heaven , she would still see me , and know if I kept my promise , and tried to win her love , by doing what I know she wished , even after she was dead ; and it was almost a pleasure to do so till now , even if it gave me pain and made me unhappy ; but now , now , aunt Emmeline , I know you must hate me ; you never , never can love me again — and that — that is so hard to bear . "
156236	156352	156353	156353	Ellen	113	" Have you forgotten , my dear Ellen , the blessed assurance , there is more joy in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth , than over ninety - and - nine who have not sinned ? and if our Father in Heaven can so feel , so act , are His creatures to do less ? Do you think , because you have given me pain , and trouble and disappointment , and compelled me to use such extreme severity , and cause you so much suffering , that it will be quite impossible for me to love you again , if I see you do all you can to win back that love ? "
156553	156567	156550	156550	Ellis	135	" that she had seen enough of that work when they were children , "
157402	157433	157355	157355	his	2686	" Dearest Ellen , do speak to me ; what has been the matter , that you look so pale and sad ? Are you not glad to see me ? "
157434	157526	157371	157371	he	2686	" Glad ! oh , Edward , you can not know how glad ; I thought you would never , never come , the storms have been so terrible ; I have been ill , and your sudden appearance startled me , for I had thought of such dreadful things , and that was the reason I could not speak at first ; but I am sure you are as pale as I am , dear , dear Edward ; you have been wounded — have you not recovered them yet ? "
157527	157574	157355	157355	his	2686	" My wounds , Ellen ! oh , they were slight enough ; I wished and tried for them to be severer , to have done for me at once , but they would not , they only bought me praise , praise which maddened me ! "
157575	157579	157581	157581	Ellen	113	" Sir Edward , "
157590	157598	157581	157581	Ellen	113	" how did he part with you ? "
157599	157632	157355	157355	his	2686	" As he has always treated me , a kind , too kind father ! oh , Ellen , Ellen , if he did but know the deceiving villain that I am ! "
157633	157659	157355	157355	his	2686	" Would he indeed not forgive , Edward , if he so loves you ? not if he knew all , the temptation , the — "
157660	157768	157355	157355	his	2686	" Temptation , Ellen ! what excuse ought there to be in temptation ? Why was I such a fool , such a madman , to allow myself to be lured into error again and again by that villain , after I had discovered his double face , and I had been warned against him , too ? Why did I so madly disregard Mr. Howard 's and my uncle 's warning letters , trusting my self - will and folly , instead of their experience ? Brave ! I am the veriest coward that ever trod the deck , because I could not bear a sneer ! "
157769	157780	157782	157782	Ellen	113	" And he ? are you still within his power ? "
157796	157941	157942	157942	He	2703	" No , Ellen , no ; God forgive me — I have tried not to rejoice ; the death was so terrible , so nearly my own , that I stood appalled , and , for the first time these two years , knelt down to my God for pardon , mercy to repent . The lightning struck him where he stood , struck him beside me , leaving the withering smile of derisive mockery , with which he had that moment been regarding me , still on his lips . Why , and where had he gone ? he , who denied God and his holy Word , turned the solemn service into mockery , and made me like himself — and why was I spared ? Oh , Ellen , I have no words to describe the sensation of that moment ! "
157953	158155	157942	157942	He	2703	" Changed as I am in appearance , it is nothing to the change within . I did not know its extent till now that I am here again , and all my happy boyhood comes before me ; aunt Emmeline 's gentle lessons of piety and goodness — oh , Ellen , Ellen , what have been their fruits ? For two years I have given myself up to passion , unrestrained by one word , one thought of prayer ; I dared , sinful madman as I was , to make a compact with my own conscience , and vow , that if I received the relief I expected from you , and was free from Harding , I would reform , would pray for the strength to resist temptation , which I had not in myself ; and when , when the man that was dispatched by Sir Edward from the shore , with the letters for the crew , sunk beneath the waves , bearing every dispatch along with him , I cursed him , and the Fate , which had ordained his death . Ellen , Ellen ! why was I saved , and Harding killed ! "
158156	158180	158182	158182	Ellen	113	" And you never received my letter , Edward ? Never knew if I had tried to relieve you from Harding 's power ? "
158230	158491	158492	158492	he	2705	" I was sure you had , Ellen , for you always did , and I could trust you as I could myself . A sudden squall had upset the boat , and the man was so encumbered by a large great - coat , every pocket filled with letters and papers , that he sunk at once though every help was offered . I threw myself into the sea to save him , and Lieutenant Morley praised my courage and benevolence — little did he know my motive ! Besides , Sir Edward told me there was an inclosure for me in my uncle 's to him , and regretted he had not kept it to give it me himself — would to Heaven he had ! Till Harding 's death I was in his power ; and he had so used it , that I had vowed , on our arrival in England , to abscond , hide myself forever , go I cared not where , nor in what character ! But he is dead , and I am free : my tale need be told to none , and if I can I will break from this fatal spell , and redeem the past ; but it seems , as if fiends urged me still to the path of evil ! Would that I had but courage to tell all to Mr. Howard , I should be safer then ; but I can not — can not — the risk is too great . Carriage wheels ! "
158496	158520	158492	158492	he	2705	up—"my aunt and Caroline ; oh , how I rejoiced when they told me at the lodge that my uncle was not here ! "
158802	158821	158822	158822	she	120	" You do indeed look as if you wanted English air and home nursing , my dear boy , "
158847	158913	158915	158915	she	120	" Sir Edward was quite right to invalid you . Emmeline does nothing but talk of your wounds as making you a complete hero ; I am unromantic enough to wish that you had brought me home more color and more flesh , and less glory ; but , I suppose from being so pale , you are more like your poor mother than ever ; "
160241	160295	160228	160228	he	76	" What is the matter with Ellen , aunt Emmeline ? Why is she so changed , and why is your manner to her so cold and distant ? and why did she kneel apart , as if unworthy to join us even in prayers ? Tell me , for pity 's sake ! "
160296	160417	160228	160228	he	76	" Not to - night , my dear Edward . It is a long tale , and a painful one , and I rely on you to help me , that Ellen and myself may be again as we have been . It is as much pain to me as to her that we are not . To - morrow , I promise you , you shall know all . You have had excitement enough for to - day , and after your exhausting voyage must need rest . Do not fancy this an evasion of your request ; I have longed for your return to influence Ellen , almost as much as for the happiness of seeing you again . "
160527	160741	160521	160521	she	113	" I am so conscious I ought not to address you , know so well that I have no right to ask any favor from you , when I have given you so much trouble and pain , that I could not have asked it , if you had not been so very , very kind this morning . Oh ! aunt Emmeline , if indeed you can feel any pity for me , do not , pray , do not tell Edward the real reason of my banishment from Oakwood ; tell him I have been very wicked — have refused to evince any real repentance — but do not tell him what I have done . He is ill , unhappy at having to resign his profession even for a few months . Oh ! spare him the misery of knowing my sin . I know I deserve nothing but severity from you — I have no right to ask this — but , oh ! if you have ever loved me , do not refuse it . If you would but grant it , would but say , before I go , that in time you will forgive me , it would be such comfort to the miserable — Ellen . "
160752	160754	160521	160521	she	113	" your "
160766	160768	160742	160743	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" the "
162067	162085	162087	162087	her	113	" Emmeline did not say you desired it , or I should have known better than disobey , "
162173	162187	162188	162188	she	113	" I do not desire it , Ellen , though I wish it , "
162193	162241	162188	162188	she	113	" you are of course at liberty to act as you please , though I should have thought it most natural that , not having been with Edward so long , you should wish to be with him as much as possible now he is at home . "
162242	162325	162431	162431	she	113	" He will not wish it ; he hates me , spurns me , as I knew he would , if he knew my sin ! To - day I was to have gone to Seldon Grange ; let me go at once ! then neither he , nor you , nor any one need be tormented with me any more , and you will all be happy again ; let me go , aunt Emmeline ; what should I stay for ? "
162326	162373	162453	162453	she	113	" If you wish it , Ellen , you shall go next week . I did not imagine that under any circumstances , you could have expressed a desire to leave me , or suppose that it would make me particularly happy to send you away . "
162374	162407	162409	162410	poor Ellen	113	" Why should it not ? you must hate me , too , or — or you would not have refused the only — only favor I asked you before I went , "
162459	162570	162453	162453	she	113	" You have reason to condemn me as harsh and cruel Ellen ; but time will perhaps explain the motives of my conduct , as I trust and pray it will solve the mystery of yours ; you are not well enough to be left long alone , and Ellis is so much engaged to - day that I do wish you to be with me , independent of your brother 's society . If you so much prefer remaining here , I will stay with you , though of course , as Edward has been away from us so long , I should wish to be with him also . "
163500	163511	163512	163512	he	76	" My sister has been disgraced , exposed before you all "
163538	163693	163512	163512	he	76	" and before you all must be her exculpation . It was less for her sin than her silence , and for the increased guilt which that appeared to conceal , you tell me , she has been so severely treated . Aunt Emmeline , I am the cause of her silence — I was the tempter to her sin — I have deceived my commander , deceived my officers , deceived you all — and instead of being what you believe me , am a gambler and a villain . She has saved me again and again from discovery and disgrace , and but for her sin and its consequences would have saved me now . But what has sin ever done but to betray and render wretched ? Take Ellen back to your love and care , aunt Emmeline , and tell my uncle , tell Sir Edward the wretch I am ! "
163871	163874	163875	163875	she	113	" Ellen , "
163903	163988	163989	163989	Ellen	113	" my own darling , devoted Ellen ! look up , and forgive me all the misery I have caused you . Speak to me , my child ! there is nothing to conceal now , all shall be forgiven — Edward 's errors , difficulties , all for your sake , and he will not , I know he will not , cause you wretchedness again ; look up , my poor child ; speak to me , tell me you forgive me . "
164698	164707	164708	164708	she	113	" Go to Edward , my dear friend , "
164738	164770	164708	164708	she	113	" he wants you more than any one else ; win him to confide in you , soothe , comfort him ; do not let him be out of your sight . "
164807	164818	164819	164819	he	128	" This is a sad welcome for you , Edward , "
164830	164899	164819	164819	he	128	" but do not be too much cut down . Ellen is very young , her constitution , Mr. Maitland assures us is good , and she may be spared us yet . I came over on purpose to see you , for late as it was when I returned from Exeter , and found you had arrived , I would not defer it till to - morrow . "
164900	164913	164915	164915	Edward	76	" You thought you came to see the pupil you so loved , "
164933	164965	164966	164966	he	76	" You do not know that I am the cause of my poor sister 's suffering , that if she dies , I am her murderer . Oh , Mr. Howard , "
164982	165027	164966	164966	he	76	" why did I ever leave you ? why did I forgot your counsels , your goodness , throw your warning letter to the winds ? Hate me if you will , but listen to me — pity me , save me from myself . "
166421	166440	166442	166442	Edward	76	" Be with me , or rather let me be with you , as much as you can , "
166453	166520	166442	166442	Edward	76	" I have no dependence on myself — a weak , miserable coward ! longing to forsake the path of evil , and having neither power nor energy to do so . I know you will tell me , pray — trust . If I had not prayed , I could not have confessed — but it will not , I know it will not last . "
166521	166626	166442	166442	Edward	76	" It will , while enduring this heavy trial of your poor sister 's terrible illness , and God 's infinite mercy may so strengthen you in the furnace of affliction , as to last in returning joy ! Despair , and you must fall ; trust , and you will hope and struggle — despite of pain or occasional relapses . Your faults are great , but not so great as Harding represented them — not so heavy but that you can conquer and redeem them , and be yet all we have believed you , all that you hoped for in yourself . "
166627	166632	166634	166634	Edward	76	" And my uncle — "
166638	166722	166634	166634	Edward	76	" Must be told ; but I will answer for him that he will be neither harsh nor unjust , nor even severe . I will write to him myself , and trust to convince him that your repentance , and resolution are sufficiently sincere , to permit you a second trial , without referring to Sir Edward . You have done nothing to expel you from your profession ; but it depends on yourself to become truly worthy of its noble service . "
167332	167432	167312	167312	Mary	143	" If I can do no good , can neither help mamma in nursing Ellen , nor do as Caroline does , I can , at least , try to comfort poor Edward , and I will not leave him . If I am so weak as not to be able to endure anxiety and sorrow without showing it , it shall not conquer me . No , no , dear Mary ; come and see me as often as you like , but I can not leave home till mamma and Ellen and we are all happy again ! "
168017	168057	168012	168012	Edward	76	" Miss Harcourt wants you , dear Caroline ; let me take your place , I will be quite as watchful as yourself ; only let me stay here , you do not know the comfort it will be . "
168152	168157	168158	168158	he	76	" Why is it , "
168161	168184	168158	168158	he	76	" that man can not bear the punishment of his faults without causing the innocent , the good , to suffer also ? "
168192	168250	168186	168186	his	76	" Because by those very social ties , the strong impulses of love for one another , which would save others from woe , we may be preserved and redeemed from vice again , and yet again , when , were man alone the sufferer , vice would be stronger than remorse , and never be redeemed . "
168365	168467	168357	168358	an infant	3556	" Can you , will you , ever forgive me , aunt Emmeline ? Your silence has almost broken my heart , for it seemed to say you never could ; and when I look at my poor Ellen , and see how I have changed this happy home into sorrow and gloom and sin , for it is all my work — mine , whom you have loved , treated , trusted , as a son — I feel you can not forgive me ; I ought to go from you ; I have no right to pollute your home . "
168468	168613	168328	168328	she	120	" Hush , Edward ! do not give utterance or indulgence to any such thoughts . My poor unhappy boy ! your errors have brought such fearful chastisement from the hand of God himself , it is not for me to treat you harshly . May His mercy avert yet severer trial ! I will not hear your story now ; you are too agitated to tell it , and I am not at this moment strong enough to hear it . I am satisfied that you have confided all to Mr. Howard , and will be guided by him . Only tell me how came you first to apply to Ellen ? Did the thought never strike you , that in sending relief to you , she might be exposing herself to inconvenience or displeasure ? Was there no consideration due to her ? "
168614	168638	168640	168640	his	2916	" I never seemed to think of her , except as glad and willing to help me , at whatever cost to herself , "
168643	168800	168640	168640	his	2916	" I feel now the cruel selfishness of the belief — but , oh , aunt Emmeline , it was fostered in me from my earliest childhood , grew with my growth , increased with my years , received strength and meaning from my poor mother 's utter neglect of her , and too indulgent thought for me . I never thought so till now , now that I know all my poor sister 's meek and gentle worth , and it makes me still more miserable . I never could think her my equal ; never could fancy she could have a will or wish apart from mine , and I can not trace the commencement of the feeling . Oh ! if we had been but treated alike ! but taught to so love each other , as to think of each other 's happiness above our own , as you taught my cousins ! "
168801	168818	168820	168821	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Do you know any thing of the promise to which poor Ellen so constantly refers ? "
169678	169750	169675	169675	her	113	" Dear aunt , have I been ill ? It seems such a long , long time since I have seen you , and my head feels so strange , so light ; and this room , it is my own , I know , but I feel as if it did not belong to me , somehow . Do make my head clear , I can not think at all . "
169751	169797	169799	169800	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Do not try to think yet , darling . You have been very , very ill , and to endeavor to think might hurt you . Strength will soon return now , I hope , and then your head will be quite clear again , "
169831	169895	169821	169821	she	113	" But what made me so ill , aunt ? I feel as if it were some great pain ; I can not remember any thing clearly , but yet it seems as if I had been very unhappy — and that — that you did not love me any more . Did any thing make me ill ? Was it really so ? "
169896	170005	169821	169821	she	113	" That I did not love you , my Ellen ! Indeed , that was only fancy . You were very unhappy , as we were all , for Edward did not come as soon as we expected him , and the storms were very dreadful , and we feared his ship might have been wrecked , or cast ashore , somewhere very far off , where we could not hear of him ; and when you saw him , and knew he was safe , the anxiety and pain you had undergone , made you ill ; you know a little thing will do that , dearest . "
170006	170020	169821	169821	she	113	" But is he really safe , aunt Emmeline ? Where is he ? "
170021	170067	169821	169821	she	113	" Close by you , love . He has been as watchful and anxious a nurse as I have been . Poor fellow , you have given him a sad welcome , but you must make up for it , by - and - by . "
170132	170154	170121	170121	Ellen	113	" Dear Edward ! come and kiss me , and do not look so sad . I shall soon get well . "
170341	170407	170336	170336	she	113	" You have looked at Edward long enough , Ellen , to be quite sure he is safe at home . So now I shall be jealous if you give him any more of your attention and neglect me ; you must take some nourishment , and try to go to sleep again , for I must not have you try your strength too much . "
170408	170416	170418	170418	Ellen	113	" If I could but remember clearly , "
170422	170452	170418	170418	Ellen	113	" it is all so vague — so dark — but I do not think it was only because he did not come , that made me so unhappy . "
170453	170464	170475	170475	she	113	" You are not going to be disobedient , dearest , "
170514	170549	170556	170556	she	113	" I told you not to think , because to do so might retard return of strength , and indeed you must try and obey me ; you know I am very peremptory sometimes . "
170837	170843	170844	170845	Mr. Maitland	154	" This will never do , "
170867	170931	170844	170845	Mr. Maitland	154	" there is something on her mind , which must be removed , even if to do so , you refer to the past . She remembers it all too clearly , I fear , so our not alluding to it does no good . You must be the physician in this case , my dear Mrs. Hamilton , for I am powerless . "
171009	171028	170989	170990	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" My poor Ellen , when shall I have the comfort of seeing you well and happy again ? "
171101	171186	171091	171091	she	113	" Oh , aunt Emmeline , how can I be happy — how can I be well — when I think — think — that if it had not been for my sin , and the misery it brought on me , Edward might be safe still ? no one need have known his errors . I tried to save — and — and I have only betrayed , and made him wretched . All I suffered was for nothing , worse than nothing ! "
171187	171255	171256	171256	she	2946	" Thank God , you have spoken , my dear child ! I felt as if I dared not introduce the subject ; but now that you have yourself , I think I shall be able , if indeed you will listen to me patiently , Ellen , to disperse the painful mists , that are still pressing so heavily on this poor little heart and brain , "
171280	171509	171256	171256	she	2946	" I do not tell you it is not a natural feeling , my love , but it is a wrong one . Had your sin , in consideration of its being , as I am now convinced it was , wholly involuntary — for in the fearful state of mind Edward 's desperate letter occasioned , you could not have known or thought of any thing , but that relief seemed sent to your hand — had it on that account been permitted so far to succeed , as to give him the aid he demanded , and never have been traced to you , it would have confirmed him in the path of guilt and error , and poisoned your happiness forever . When you recall the agony , almost madness you felt , while burdened with the consciousness of such an act , how could you have borne it , if it had continued through months , perhaps years ? You shudder ; yet this must have been the case , and Edward would have persisted in error , if your sin had been permitted to succeed . Its detection , and the sufferings thence springing , terrible as they have been to you , my poor child , have saved him ; and will , I trust , only bring securer happiness to you . "
171510	171514	171516	171516	Ellen	113	" Saved him ! "
171527	171530	171265	171265	she	2946	words—"saved Edward ! "
171531	171722	171265	171265	she	2946	" Yes , dearest , by leading him to a full confession , and giving him not only the inexpressible comfort of such a proceeding , but permitting him to see , that great and disappointing as his errors are , they can be conquered . They are not of the irremediable , guilt - confirming nature , that he was taught to suppose them for Harding 's own most guilty ends , and so giving him hope and resolution to amend , which a belief that amendment is impossible , entirely frustrates . Do not fear for Edward , my own love ; he will give you as much pride and comfort as he has anxiety and grief ; and you , under God 's mercy , will have been the cause . It is a hard lesson to learn , and yet , Ellen , I think one day , when you can look back more calmly on the last few months , you will acknowledge with me , that great as your sufferings have been , they were sent in love both to him and to you . "
171723	171765	171766	171766	she	2947	" If they have saved him — saved him from a continuance in error , and so made him happy!—Oh , aunt Emmeline , I can think so now , and I will try to bear the rest ? but why , "
171773	171803	171766	171766	she	2947	" oh , why have you been so good , so kind ? Why did you not continue cold and distant ? I could bear it better , then . "
171804	171838	171265	171265	she	2946	" Bear what , love ? What have you more to bear ? Tell me all without reserve . Why should I be cold , when you deserve all my love and kindness ? "
171839	171912	171265	171265	she	2946	" Because — because , am I not to go to Seldon Grange , as soon as I am strong enough ? Uncle Hamilton said , there could be no excusing cause demanding a complete avoidance of his sentence . I thought it was pain enough when you first told me ; but now , now every time I think about it , it seems as if I could not bear it . "
171913	172063	172064	172064	Ellen	113	" And you are not called upon to bear it , my dear child . Is it possible you could think for a moment that I could send you away from me , when you have borne so much , and been treated with far too much severity already ? Did I not tell you that the term of your banishment depended entirely on the motive of your silence , and do you think there was no excuse in your motive , my Ellen , mistaken as it was ? Is self - devotion to be of no more account to me , than it seemed to you ? Come , smile , dearest ; I promise you , in your uncle 's name and my own , you shall never leave us , unless it be of your own free will and pleasure , a few years hence . "
172173	172200	172202	172203	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" And now , my Ellen , that I have relieved you of a painful dread , will you ease my mind of a great anxiety ? "
172227	172302	172219	172219	she	113	" You look surprised ; but it is a subject you alone can explain , and till it is solved , I shall never feel that your happiness is secure . What is this promise , to which in your illness you so constantly referred , and which , I fear , has strengthened you in the system of self - sacrifice for Edward 's sake , in addition to your love for him ? "
172321	172379	172316	172316	she	113	" Ought I to tell you , dear aunt ? You do not know how often , how very often I have longed to ask you , if to keep it made me do wrong — whether I ought to break it ? And yet it seemed so sacred , and it gave poor mamma such comfort ! "
172380	172433	172219	172219	she	113	" When did you make it , love ? Its import I need not ask you , for you betrayed it , when you knew not what you said , and it was confirmed by your whole conduct . To shield Edward from blame or punishment , by never revealing his faults ? "
172434	172439	172441	172441	Ellen	113	" Was it wrong ? "
172448	172518	172441	172441	Ellen	113	" Wrong in you ! no dearest ; for you were too young to know all the pain and evil it was likely to bring . Tell me when , and how , it was taken ; and I think I can prove to you that your poor mother would have recalled it , had she had the least idea of the solemn hold it had taken upon you . "
173443	173470	173471	173471	she	113	" You could scarcely have acted otherwise than you have always done toward Edward , my dear Ellen , under the influence of such a promise , "
173474	173587	173471	173471	she	113	" your extreme youth , naturally enough , could not permit you to distinguish , whether it was called for by a mere impulse of feeling in your poor mother , or really intended . But tell me , do you think it would give me any comfort or happiness if I could see Emmeline act by Percy as you have done by Edward ? To see her suffer pain and sorrow , and be led into error , too , sometimes , to conceal Percy 's faults , and prevent their removal , when , by the infliction of some trifling pain , it would save his exposing himself to greater ? "
173588	173623	173421	173421	her	113	" But it seems so different with my cousins , aunt ; they are all such equals . I can not fancy Emmeline in my place . You have always loved them all alike . "
173624	173639	173471	173471	she	113	" And do you not think a mother ought to do to , dearest ? "
173640	173766	173471	173471	she	113	" But how can she , if they are not all equally deserving ? I was so different to Edward : he was so handsome and good , and so animated and happy ; and I was always fretful and ill , and they said so often naughty ; and he used to fondle poor mamma , and show his love , which I was afraid to do , though I did love her so very much ( the tears started to her eyes ) , so I could not help feeling he must be much better than I was , just as I always feel all my cousins are , and so it was no wonder poor mamma loved him so much the best . "
173767	173781	173783	173784	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Have I ever made any difference between Edward and you , Ellen ? "
173803	173810	173812	173812	she	113	" Oh , no , no ! "
173821	173854	173812	173812	she	113	" But you are so good , so kind to every body ; you would love me , and be kind to me as poor papa was , because nobody else could . "
174056	174076	174049	174049	you	113	" Ellen 's earnest face , on which joy and hope seemed struggling with doubt , was sufficient answer . "
174159	174188	174153	174153	you	113	" Ellen did remember them , and acknowledged they had so increased her affection for her mother , as to render the promise still more sacred to her . "
174407	174574	174577	174577	you	2987	" Ellen 's tears were falling fast and freely , but they were hardly tears of pain . Her aunt 's words seemed to disperse a thick mist from her brain and heart , and for the first time , to satisfy her that she might dismiss the painful memory of her promise , and dismiss it without blame or disobedience to her mother . Mrs. Hamilton had begun the conversation in trembling , for it seemed so difficult to accomplish her object without undue condemnation of her sister ; but as Ellen , clasping her arms about her neck , tried to thank her again and again , for taking such a heavy load from her heart , saying that she would still help Edward just the same , and she would try to guard him and herself from doing wrong , that her mother should love her still , she felt she had succeeded , and silently , but how fervently , thanked God . "
174628	174629	174615	174615	she	1458	" "
174721	174726	174711	174711	I	0	" she continued playfully ; "
174748	174749	174711	174711	I	0	" "
174765	174775	174750	174750	I	0	" replied Ellen , trying to smile , too . "
174884	175222	175243	175244	Mrs. Hamilton	81	" Her playfulness had given place to renewed earnestness , and Ellen , as if in the very thought of such perfect confidence dwelt security and peace , so long unknown to her , gave the required assurance so eagerly and gratefully , that Mrs. Hamilton was satisfied and happy . From that day , Ellen 's recovery , though a sad trial of patience both to the young invalid and her affectionate nurses , was surely progressive , without any of those painful relapses which had so tried Mr. Maitland 's skill before . She no longer shrunk from the society of her relations , receiving Caroline 's and Miss Harcourt 's many kind attentions with surprise indeed , for she could not imagine what could so have altered their feelings toward her , but with that evident gratitude and pleasure , which encourages a continuance of kindness . Emmeline was always kind , but it was indeed happiness to feel she might talk with and share her amusements , as in former days ; and that , instead of thinking she ought not to receive her aunt 's affection , the only thing she asked in return was her full confidence . The inexpressible rest to poor Ellen which that conversation gave is not to be described . It was so blessed , so soothing , that it seemed too unnatural to last , and the secret dread that her uncle would not feel toward her and Edward as her aunt did was its only alloy . Edward , too , was cheerful , and almost happy when with her ; and a long conversation with Mr. Howard , which that worthy man insisted upon having as soon as she was strong enough , to remove the false impressions which his severity had given , and which never ceased to grieve and reproach him , caused his almost daily visits to be anticipated by her with as much gladness as they had before brought dread . "
175290	175291	175292	175292	He	3454	" "
175323	175330	175315	175315	you	2993	well"—(the worthy doctor shook his head most unbelievingly)—"but
175389	175390	175436	175436	I	0	" "
175493	175494	175481	175481	He	84	" "
175498	175507	175481	175481	He	84	" answered Mrs. Hamilton , turning very pale ; "
175528	176084	175481	175481	He	84	" Oakwood had resumed its regular happy aspect , though Ellen was still up - stairs . Morris and Ellis had once more the happiness of their beloved mistress 's superintendence , and proud were they both , as if Caroline had been their own child , to show all she had done , and so unostentatiously , to save her mother trouble when she had been too anxious to think of any thing but Ellen ; and the mother 's heart swelled with a delicious feeling of gratitude to Him who , if in making her so acutely sensible of her solemn responsibility had deepened and extended anxiety , had yet in the same measure heightened and spiritualized joy . The fruit was indeed worth the nurture , though it might have been often washed with tears . Intensely anxious as she felt herself , as did also Mr. Howard and Mr. Maitland , and , in fact , all Arthur Hamilton 's friends , she yet tried to sustain the spirits of her children , for the young men had evidently grown anxious on the subject too . It was not unlikely that the seas round Feroe , always stormy , should prevent any ship leaving the island , and the young people eagerly grasped the idea : so painful is it to youth to realize a cause for anxiety ; but even they , at times , grew unconsciously sad and meditating , as the usually joyous season of Christmas and New Year passed , and still there was no letter . Ellen and Edward both in secret dreaded the arrival of the answer to the latter 's confession ; but still their affection for Mrs. Hamilton was too powerful to permit any thought of self interfering with the wish that her anxiety might be calmed . In January the weather changed ; the tremendous winds gave place to an almost unnatural calm , and to such excessive mildness and closeness of atmosphere , that it affected the health of many who were strong , and not only made Ellen very languid , but frequently recalled those dreadful headaches which were in themselves an illness . Business called Mr. Howard to Dartmouth near the end of the month , and he prevailed on Edward to accompany him , for whenever his sister was more than usually suffering his gloom redoubled . The first few days were so fine that the change renovated him ; Mr. Howard declared it was the sight of old ocean , and Edward did not deny it ; for though it was good for the permanence of his repentance and resolution to amend , to have the influence of his home sufficiently long , his spirit inwardly chafed at his detention , and yearned to be at sea again , and giving proof of his determination to become indeed a British sailor . The third day of their visit , the lull and heaviness of the air increased so strangely and closely , for January , as to seem almost portentous . Edward and Mr. Howard lingered on the beach ; the well - practiced eye of the former tracing in many little things unseen to landsmen , the slow , but sure approach of a fearful storm . "
176101	176161	176263	176263	God	85	" he said , directing Mr. Howard 's attention to ridges of white - fringed clouds floating under the heavens , whose murky hue was becoming denser and denser ; and ever and anon , as lashed by some as yet silent and invisible blast , the ocean heaved and foamed , and gave sure evidence of approaching fury ; "
176181	176202	176205	176205	they	3001	" ( several sea - gulls were skimming along the waves almost bathing their white plumage in the blackened waters ) "
176226	176227	176210	176210	Emmeline	78	" "
176233	176262	176210	176210	Emmeline	78	" rejoined Mr. Howard , as a long hollow blast moaned and shivered round them , followed by the roar of a mountainous wave bursting on the beach . "
176273	176654	176655	176655	They	3003	" and he gladly turned more inland , while Edward remained watching its progress with an almost pleasurable feeling of excitement , only wishing he could but be on the sea , to enjoy it as such a storm deserved to be . As the day drew to a close it increased , and as darkness set in , its fury became appalling . Blasts , long and loud as the reverberation of artillery , succeeded one another with awful rapidity , tearing up huge trees by the roots , and tiles from the roofs . Now and then , at distant intervals , blue lightning played through the black heavens , betraying that thunder had mingled with the wind , though it was impossible to distinguish the one sound from the other ; and as the gusts passed onward , streaks of white and spots of strange unnatural blue gleamed through the gloom for a moment 's space , leaving deeper darkness as they disappeared . The ocean , lashed to wildest fury , rolled in huge mountains of troubled waters , throwing up showers of snowy foam , contrasting strangely with the darkness of earth and heaven , and bursting with a sound that deadened for the time even the wild roar of the blast . To read or even to converse , in their comfortable quarters in the hotel , which overlooked the sea , became as impossible to Mr. Howard as to Edward . About eleven o'clock , however , the wind suddenly veered and lulled , only sending forth now and then a long sobbing wail , as if regretful that its work of destruction was even checked ; but the sea raged with equal fury , presenting a spectacle as magnificent , as awful , and giving no appearance of a calm . A sharp report sounded suddenly from the sea — whether it was the first , or that others might have been lost in the tumult of the winds and waves , who might answer ? Another , and another , at such rapid intervals , that the danger was evidently imminent , and Edward started to his feet . Again — and he could bear it no longer . Hurriedly exclaiming , "
176681	176775	176776	176776	They	3003	" he rushed to the beach , closely followed by Mr. Howard , who was resolved on preventing any mad attempt . Crowds of fishermen and townsmen had congregated on the beach , drawn by that fearful sound , which , by the light from the guns seemed scarcely half a mile distant ; and yet so perilous was the present appearance of the ocean , that to go to their assistance seemed impossible . Suddenly , however , Edward 's voice exclaimed , with the glad and eager tone of perfect confidence , "
176808	176820	176806	176806	you	3011	" he continued turning eagerly to the group of hardy fishermen , "
176845	176846	176847	176853	No one who cares for his life	3013	" "
176855	176910	176847	176853	No one who cares for his life	3013	" was the sullen answer from one of those he addressed , and the rest stood silent , eyeing , half disdainfully half admiringly , the slight figure of the young sailor , revealed as it was , in the fitful light of the many torches scattered by the various groups along the beach . "
176949	176950	176951	176951	I	0	" "
176963	176972	176954	176954	I	0	" answered Edward , his passion rising high . "
177078	177193	177073	177073	I	0	" It would have made a fine scene for a painter , that young , slight form and boyish face , surrounded by those weather - beaten men , every countenance expressing some different emotion , yet almost all unwilling admiration ; the torches ' glare , so lurid on the pitchy darkness ; the sheets of foam , rising and falling like showers of dazzling snow ; the craggy background ; and , out at sea , the unfortunate vessel , a perfect wreck , struggling still with the fast - rising waters . Mr. Howard saw all , but with no thought of the picturesque , his mind was far otherwise engaged . "
177248	177311	177317	177317	they	3030	" exclaimed a stalwart young fisherman , advancing , and Edward eagerly grasped his rough hand , conjuring him to get his boat at once , there was not a moment to lose ; but the example was infectious , and an old man hastily stepped forward , declaring the youngsters had taught him his duty , and he would do it . "
177320	177365	177317	177317	they	3030	" exclaimed Edward , as his younger companion hastened down the beach to bring his boat to the leeward of the cliff , to launch it more securely , and a rumor ran through the crowds , whence arising it was impossible to discover . "
177407	177512	177513	177513	Edward	76	" But none could tell more than that a vessel , entering the harbor just before the gale , had hailed the Siren , about twenty miles distant , and she seemed laboring heavily , and in such a distressed state that a very little would finish her . Not a word escaped Edward 's lips which grew for the moment blanched as marble . Mr. Howard to whom the rumor had brought the most intense agony , for not a doubt of its truth would come to relieve him , was at his side , grasping his hand , and murmuring , hoarsely — "
177532	177533	177535	177535	me	0	" "
177590	177598	177599	177599	Ellen	113	fail"—he stopped , in strong emotion , then added—"give
177605	177629	177599	177599	Ellen	113	" he cut off a lock of his hair with his dirk , and placed it and his watch in Mr. Howard 's trembling hand.—"And
177644	178002	178003	178004	The Siren	2097	" He threw himself a moment in Mr. Howard 's arms , kissed his cheek , and , darting down the beach , leaped into the boat , which was dancing like a nutshell on the water . It was several minutes , ere they could succeed in getting her off , the waves seeming determined to cast her back ; but they were fairly launched at length , and then they heeded not that one minute they rode high on a mountain wave , seeming as if nothing could save them from being dashed in the abyss below ; the next were buried in a deep valley , surrounded by huge walls of water , threatening to burst and overwhelm them . For a boat to live in such a sea at all seemed miraculous ; and old Collins always declared that unless some angel sat at the helm with Edward , no human arm could have taken them in safety . If it were an angel , it was the pure thought , the faith - winged prayer , that he might be the instrument in the Eternal 's hand , of turning aside death and misery from that beloved home , in which even his errors had been met with love , and conquered by forgiveness . With every effort , and they were such as to bid the perspiration stream down the face and arms of those strong men , and almost exhaust Edward , for he took an oar in turn , it was full an hour from their leaving the shore before they reached the ship . She had ceased firing , for by the lights on shore they had discovered the boat 's departure , and watched her progress by the lantern at her head , as only those can watch who feel , one short hour more , and their ship will float no longer ! Collins was spokesman , for Edward , as they grappled the boat alongside , had sunk down for the moment powerless by the helm ; roused , however , effectually by the answer — "
178027	178028	178023	178025	nine in crew	3040	" "
178054	178055	178037	178038	Captain Harvey	226	" "
178061	178066	178058	178059	old Collins	227	" returned the captain ; "
178093	179125	179127	179127	his	3045	" His companion leaped into the boat without reply , and , sinking on one of the benches , drew his cloak closely round his face . Peril was indeed still around him , but compared with the — even to that Heaven - directed heart — terrible struggle of beholding death , rising slowly but surely round him in the water - filling ship , almost within sight and sound of his home , his beloved ones , the mere hope of life seemed almost overpowering . The crew of the hapless Siren quickly deserted her . Captain Harvey was the last to descend , and , as he did so , a block of iron , loosened from its place , fell cornerwise , and struck sharply on Edward 's forehead , almost stunning him for the moment , as he watched the captain 's descent . He felt the blood slowly trickling down his temple and cheek ; but he was not one to be daunted by pain : he resumed his station at the helm in unbroken silence , only speaking when directions were absolutely necessary , and then only in a few brief sailor - terms . They had scarcely proceeded a third of their way , when the waters boiled and foamed as tossed by some strange whirlpool , and it required all Edward 's address and skill as steersman to prevent the frail boat from being drawn into the vortex . The cause was soon displayed , and every heart shuddered , for ten minutes later , and help would indeed have been in vain . The unfortunate vessel had sunk — been swallowed up in those rushing waters ; the suction of so large a mass , producing for a brief interval the effect of a whirlpool . The silence of awe and of intense thankfulness , fell on the heart of every man , and more than all on his , who had so far recovered his first emotion as to gaze wonderingly and admiringly on the boyish figure at the helm , whose voice was utterly unknown , and whose features the fitful light , and the youth 's steadfast gaze on his rowers , prevented his tracing with any certainty . The crowds had increased on the shore , watching with intense eagerness the return of the boat ; but the expectation was too deep for sound , silence almost portentous reigned . A huge sea had concealed her for several minutes , and Mr. Howard , who during these two long hours had remained spell - bound on the beach , groaned aloud in his agony ; again she was visible , driven on with fearful velocity by the tide , nearer , nearer still . He thought he could distinguish the figure of his friend : he was sure he could hear the voice of Edward , urging , commanding , directing a landing somewhere , in contradiction to the opinion of others . They were within a dozen yards of the shore , but still not a sound of gratulation was heard . Every eye was fixed , as in the fascination of terror , on a wave in the distance , increasing in size and fury as it rapidly approached . It neared the boat — it stood impending over the frail thing as a mighty avalanche of waters — it burst ; the boat was seen no longer , and a wild and terrible cry sounded far and near along the beach ! The whole of the day Mrs. Hamilton had vainly tried to shake off a most unwonted gloom . Convinced herself that it was greatly physical , from the unusual oppressiveness of the weather relaxing the nerves , which had so many months been overstrained , yet her thoughts would cling to Mr. Maitland 's words , that her husband might be coming home himself ; but if the accounts of Ellen 's danger and Edward 's confession had recalled him , he ought to have arrived full two or three weeks previous . The gale that swept round her — the awful and unnatural darkness — the remarkable phenomena , at that season , of lightning — and the long , loud thunder - claps[4 ] which inland could be fearfully distinguished from the gale , appalled the whole household ; and therefore it was not much wonder that the vague idea of her husband 's having left Feroe , and exposure to such a tempest , should become in that fearful anxiety almost a certainty of agony . It was well , perhaps , that her unselfish nature had an object to draw her in some slight degree out of herself , for her firmness , her trust beyond the accidents of earth , all seemed about to fail her , and make her for the time being most wretched . As the storm and closeness increased , so did Ellen 's feverish restlessness ; her nerves , not yet fully restored , felt strung almost to torture with every flash , and clap , and blast . She tried to laugh at her own folly ; for , though often terrified , when a little child , at the storms in India , those of England had never affected her at all , and she could not understand why she should feel this so childishly . But argument is of little moment in such cases ; and Mrs. Hamilton , satisfying her that she could no more help her present sensation than her physical weakness , tried to soothe and amuse her , and in so doing partially cheered herself . She did not leave her till past midnight ; and then desiring Mrs. Langford to sit up with her till she was comfortably asleep , retired to her own bed - room . Never since her husband 's absence had its solitude felt so vast — so heavily oppressive ; thought after thought of him thronged her mind till she fairly gave up the effort to struggle with them . "
179143	179534	179127	179127	his	3045	" rose to her lips , as she gazed round her , and the deep stillness , the gloom only broken by a small silver lamp , and the fitful light of the fire , seemed but a solemn answer . She buried her face in her clasped hands , and the clock struck two before that inward conflict permitted her once more to lift up heart and brow in meek , trusting faith to Him who still watched over her and her beloved ones ; and after an earnest , voiceless prayer , she drew her little table , with its books of devotion , to the fire , and read thoughtfully , prayerfully , for another hour , and then sought her couch . But she could not sleep ; the wind had again arisen , and fearing to lie awake and listen to it would only renew her unusual agitation , she rose at four , dressed herself , and throwing on a large shawl , softly traversed the passage , and entered her niece 's room ; finding her , as she fully expected , as wakeful and restless as herself , with the addition of an intense headache . She had persuaded nurse Langford to go to bed , but the pain had come on since then , and made her more restless and feverish than before . She could not lie in any posture to get ease , till at last , about six o'clock , completely exhausted , she fell asleep , sitting almost upright in her aunt 's arms , her head leaning against her , as she stood by the bedside . Fearing to disturb her , Mrs. Hamilton would not move , desiring the morning prayers to be said without her , and Miss Harcourt and her daughters not to wait breakfast , as she would have it with Ellen when she awoke . That she was stiff and exhausted with three hours ' standing in one position , she did not heed , perhaps scarcely felt , for woman 's loveliest attribute , that of a tender and utterly unselfish nurse , was hers to perfection . But she did not refuse the cup of chocolate Caroline brought her herself , and with affectionate earnestness entreated her to take . "
179575	179576	179577	179577	I	0	" "
179644	179862	179637	179637	your	3046	" Caroline very unwillingly obeyed , and about a quarter of an hour afterward , Mrs. Hamilton was startled by the sound of a carriage advancing with unusual velocity to the house . It stopped at the main entrance , and she had scarcely time to wonder who could be such very early visitors , when a loud scream , in the voice of Emmeline , rung in her ears ; whether of joy or grief she could not distinguish , but it was the voice of her child , and the already tortured nerves of the wife and mother could not bear it without a sensation of terror , amounting to absolute agony . She laid Ellen 's head tenderly on the pillow , watched over her , though her limbs so trembled she could scarcely support herself , saw with intense relief that the movement had not disturbed her quiet sleep , and calling Mrs. Langford from an adjoining room , hastily descended the stairs , though how she did so , and entered the breakfast - room , she always said she never knew . Many and eager and glad voices were speaking at once ; the very servants thronged the hall and threshold of the room , but all made way for her . "
179866	180124	179637	179637	your	3046	" she did find voice to exclaim , but every object but his figure reeled before her , and she fainted in his arms . It was some time before she recovered , for mind and frame had been too long overtasked ; and Mr. Hamilton , as he clasped her in his arms , beseeching her only to speak to him , and gazed on her deathlike countenance , felt in a moment that great as his anxiety had been for her , he had not imagined one - half she had endured . His voice — his kiss — seemed to rouse the scattered senses , even more effectually than Miss Harcourt 's anxiously proffered remedies ; but she could not speak , she only looked up in his face , as if to be quite , quite sure he had indeed returned ; that her vague fancies of danger , even if they had foundation , had merged in the most blissful reality , that she was no longer alone ; and leaning her head on his bosom , was only conscious of a thankfulness too deep for words ; a repose that , since his departure , she had not known for a single day . Neither she nor her husband could believe that it was only six months since they had been separated . It seemed , and to Mrs. Hamilton especially , as if she must have lived through years in that time , it had been so fraught with sorrow . "
180180	180181	180186	180186	you	3546	" "
180192	180209	180210	180210	She	3420	" said Emmeline , eagerly , as her mother tried to smile and speak in answer . "
180264	180290	180255	180255	I	0	" continued the affectionate girl , kneeling down by her mother , and clinging to her , adding , in a suppressed , terrified voice , "
180297	180380	180255	180255	I	0	" Mrs. Hamilton read in a moment that Emmeline 's playfulness was only assumed to hide strong emotion ; that she was trying very hard for complete control , but so trembling , that she knelt down , literally because she could not stand . It was such a proof of her endeavor to profit by her mother 's gentle lessons , that even at that moment it not only gave her the sweetest gratification , but helped her to rouse herself . "
180392	180426	180385	180385	you	3058	" she said , quite in her usual voice , as she pressed her child a moment to her , and kissed her cheek , which was almost as pale as her own . "
180502	180529	180496	180496	you	3546	" she added , looking earnestly in his face , and half wondering at the expression upon it , it seemed to speak so many things ; "
180546	180547	180548	180548	I	0	" "
180622	180659	180660	180660	I	0	" Mrs. Hamilton 's hand closed convulsively on her husband 's ; her eyes riveted on his countenance as if she would grasp his whole meaning at once , but little did she guess the whole . "
180666	180678	180660	180660	I	0	" he added , striving for composure , and even playfulness , "
180700	180701	180708	180708	I	0	" "
180719	180789	180717	180717	Edward	76	" rejoined Caroline , who , at the news of her father having been in danger , had left the breakfast - table , unable to keep away from him , even that short distance , but neither she , nor either of the others , connecting her cousin with Mr. Hamilton 's words , and not quite understanding why he should have so interrupted the most interesting subject . "
180822	180823	180825	180825	him	76	" "
180830	180884	180825	180825	him	76	" replied Mr. Hamilton , still determinately hiding his feelings under a tone and manner of jest , and leaving his wife 's side for a moment , he drew Edward from the recess of the window , where all this time he had been standing quite unobserved , and led him forward . "
180896	180954	180888	180888	Edward	76	" exclaimed Miss Harcourt , and her exclamation was echoed by Caroline and Emmeline , while Mrs. Hamilton gazed at him in bewildered alarm . He was deadly pale , with every appearance of exhaustion , and a most disfiguring patch on his left brow , which he had tried in vain to hide with his hair . "
180960	180961	180955	180955	You	76	" "
181000	181035	180997	180998	dear aunt	3449	" he answered , with the same attempt at jest as his uncle , and throwing himself lightly on an ottoman by Mrs. Hamilton , he laid his head very quietly on her lap . "
181065	181066	181046	181046	Arthur	84	" "
181076	181087	181088	181088	He	3076	" ( there was no attempt at jest now ) . "
181158	181159	181134	181134	God	85	" "
181198	181783	181185	181185	I	0	" were the only words poor Edward could speak , when the first intensity of his aunt 's emotion was in some degree conquered , and she could look in his young face , though her eyes were almost blinded with tears , and putting back the bright hair which the rain and spray had so uncurled , as to lay heavy and damp upon his pale forehead , she imprinted a long , silent kiss upon it , and looking alternately at him and her husband , seemed powerless to realize any other thought . Mr. Hamilton briefly , but most eloquently , narrated the events of the previous night , dwelling only sufficiently on his imminent peril , to evince the real importance of Edward 's extraordinary exertions , not to harrow the feelings of his listeners more than need be . That the young officer 's determined opposition to the almost angrily expressed opinions of Captain Harvey and old Collins as to the better landing - place , had saved them from the effects of the huge wave , which had burst like a water - spout a minute after they had all leaped in safety on shore , almost overwhelming the projecting sand to which Collins had wished to direct the boat , and so proving at once Edward 's far superior nautical knowledge , for had they steered there , the frail bark must inevitably have been upset , and its crew washed by the receding torrent back to sea . Harvey and Collins acknowledged their error at once , and looked eagerly for Edward to say so to him , but he had vanished the moment they had achieved a safe landing , to Mr. Hamilton 's annoyance , for he had not the least suspicion who he was , and only longed to express , if he could not otherwise evince his gratitude , Collins and Grey refusing the smallest credit , declaring that if it had not been for this young stranger officer , of whom they knew nothing , not even his name , not a man would have stirred ; that for any fisherman or mere ordinary sailor to have guided the boat to and from the sinking vessel , in such a sea , was so impossible , that no one would have attempted it ; old Collins ending , with the superstition of his class , by a declaration , that his disappearance convinced his already more than suspicion , that it was some good angel in a boy 's likeness ; for Arthur Hamilton would never have been permitted so to perish : an explanation , Mr. Hamilton added , laughingly , that might suit his Emmy , but was rather too fanciful for him . However , his young preserver was nowhere to be found , but , to his extreme astonishment , and no little relief ( for now that he was so near home , his anxiety to hear of all , especially Ellen , whom he scarcely dared hope to find alive , became insupportable ) , Mr. Howard suddenly stood before him , grasping both his hands , without the power , for a minute or two , to speak . Mr. Hamilton overwhelmed him with questions , scarcely giving him time to answer one before he asked another . They had nearly reached the hotel , when Captain Harvey 's bluff voice was heard exclaiming — "
181814	181843	181847	181848	Captain Harvey	226	" But before Mr. Hamilton could make any rejoinder , save to grasp the young man 's hands strongly in his own , Mr. Howard said , eagerly — "
181902	181927	181929	181929	you	0	" Captain Harvey bore him off , almost carrying him , for exertion and a variety of emotions had rendered him faint and powerless . "
181941	182058	181939	181939	he	1315	" But Mr. Howard did not , perhaps could not reply , but hurried his friend on to the hotel ; and entered the room , where , having called for lights , and all the ingredients of grog - punch , which he vowed the boy should have instead of the brandy and water he had called for , they found Edward trying to laugh , and protesting against all coddling ; he was perfectly well , and he would not go to bed , and could not imagine what right Captain Harvey had to be a sailor , if he thought so much of a storm , and a blow , and a wetting . "
182094	182924	182074	182074	you	0	" And so like his dying mother it was , that Mr. Hamilton stood for a moment on the threshold , completely stupefied . We leave our readers to imagine the rest ; and how Captain Harvey carried the seemingly marvelous news that the brave young officer was Mr. Hamilton 's own nephew , over the town , and in every fisherman 's hut , in a miraculously short space of time . We may as well state here at once , to save farther retrospection , that Mr. Hamilton , by the active and admirable assistance of Morton , had , after a three months ' residence at Feroe , perceived that he might return to England much sooner than he had at first anticipated ; still he did not like to mention even the probability of such a thing to his family , till perfectly certain himself . Morton never ceased persuading him to name a period for his return , knowing the comfort it would be to his home ; but Mr. Hamilton could not bear the idea of leaving his friend in his voluntary banishment so many months sooner than they had reckoned on . When , however , the letters came from Oakwood , detailing Edward 's return , and the discoveries thence proceeding , his anxiety and , let it be owned , his extreme displeasure against his nephew , prompted his return at once . Morton not only conquered every objection to his immediate departure , but tried , and in some measure succeeded , to soften his anger , by bringing before him many points in Mr. Howard 's letter , showing real , good , and true repentance in the offender , which a first perusal of a narrative of error had naturally overlooked . The seas , however , were so fearfully tempestuous and the winds so adverse , that it was impossible either to leave Feroe , or get a letter conveyed to Scotland , for a full fortnight after the Siren 's last voyage . Nothing but the extreme urgency of the case , increased by the fact that the detention of the Siren at Wick had given Mr. Hamilton a double packet of letters , but the second , though dated ten days later , gave the same hopeless account of Ellen , could have made him attempt a voyage home in such weather ; yet he felt he could not rest , knowing intuitively the misery his wife must be enduring , and scarcely able to bear even the thought of what seemed most probable , that Ellen would be taken from her , and the aggravated trial it would be . The voyage was a terrible one , for length and heavy gales . More than once they wished to put into port , that Mr. Hamilton might continue his journey by land , but their only safety seemed keeping out at sea , the storm threatening to dash them on rock or shoal , whenever in sight of land . By the time they reached the Land 's End — they had come westward of England , instead of eastward , as they went — the vessel was in such a shattered and leaky condition , that Captain Harvey felt and acknowledged , she could not weather out another storm . The calm that had followed the heavy gales , gave hope to all ; even though the constant shiftings of the wind , which was now not more than what , in sailor 's parlance , is called a cat's - paw , prevented their making as much way as they desired . At length they were within twenty miles of Dartmouth , and not a doubt of their safety disturbed them , until the darkening atmosphere , the sullen rise and suppressed roar of the billows , the wind sobbing and wailing at first , and then bursting into that awful gale , which we have before described , banished every human hope at once . The rudder snapped ; every half - hour the water gained upon the hold , though every man worked the pumps . There was not a shred of canvas , but the masts , and yards , and stays bent and snapped like reeds before the blast . To guide her was impossible ; she was driven on — on — till she struck on a reef of rock about a mile , or less , perhaps from Dartmouth . Then came their signals of distress , as a last lone hope , for the crew of the Siren were all too good seamen to dare believe a boat could either be pushed off , or live in such a sea . Their wonder , their hope , their intense thankfulness , when it was discovered , may be imagined . The rest is known . "
182938	183008	182928	182928	you	3091	" inquired his aunt , whose eyes , it seemed , would turn upon him , as if impossible to connect that slight figure with such immense exertions — though some time had passed , and a social , happy breakfast , round which all still lingered , had enabled them to subdue too painful emotion , and only to be conscious of the most deep and grateful joy . "
183098	183099	183078	183079	Mr. Howard	128	" "
183110	183131	183108	183108	Ned	76	" demanded Emmeline , all her high spirits recalled . Her cousin hesitated and a flush mounted to his forehead . "
183141	183142	183136	183136	Emmeline	78	" "
183145	183151	183182	183182	you	3091	" she repeated , laughing ; "
183190	183191	183182	183182	you	3091	" "
183199	183207	183193	183193	you	3091	" he answered , with startling earnestness . "
183336	183352	183354	183354	you	3091	" and , rising hurriedly , he left the room before any one could reply . "
183379	183501	183371	183371	he	3470	" pleaded Emmeline ; her sister and Miss Harcourt joining in the entreaty and belief , and Mrs. Hamilton looking in his face without uttering a word . Mr. Hamilton 's answer seemed to satisfy all parties . Ellen meanwhile had awoke , quite refreshed , and all pain gone , been dressed and conveyed to her daily quarters , the events of the morning entirely unknown to her ; for though the joyful news , spreading like wildfire through the house , had reached Mrs. Langford 's ears , and made her very happy , she had quite judgment enough , even without a message to the effect from her mistress , to keep it from Ellen till carefully prepared . "
183516	183542	183504	183504	I	0	" inquired Mrs. Hamilton , playfully , as she entered her room , about twelve o'clock , after a long private conversation with her husband . "
183568	183569	183545	183545	you	0	" "
183606	183626	183596	183596	I	0	" Ellen did look , and so radiant was that kind face with happiness , that she was startled . "
183641	183649	183634	183634	You	0	" she added , her voice trembling . "
183656	183657	183658	183658	He	1463	" "
183694	183921	183922	183922	Emmeline	78	" Ellen tried to sympathize in it ; but Mrs. Hamilton soon saw that her perhaps near dread of what should be her uncle 's judgment on her brother and herself , prevented all pleasurable anticipation of his arrival , and that the only effectual way of removing it was to let them meet as soon as possible . Three days after Mr. Hamilton 's arrival , a cheerful party assembled in his wife 's dressing - room , which , in its elegant appurtenances — signs as they were , of a most refined and beautiful taste — certainly deserved a higher appellation ; but boudoir , Percy had always declared , did not harmonize at all with the old English comforts of Oakwood , and he would not have a French word to designate his mother 's room especially . Ellen was on her sofa working ; Edward , who she thought had only returned that morning , at her side , reading ; Caroline and Emmeline , drawing , the one with some degree of perseverance , the other with none at all . It seemed as if she could not sit still , and her wild sallies , and snatches of old songs , repeatedly made Miss Harcourt look up from her book , and Mrs. Hamilton from her work , surprised . "
183929	183936	183937	183937	you	78	" exclaimed Caroline , at length ; "
183947	183948	183937	183937	you	78	" "

184467	184478	184452	184452	she	3420	" replied Emmeline , springing to her mother 's side ; "

184504	184520	184522	184522	I	0	" answered her mother , half - gravely , half in Emmeline 's own tone ; "

184873	185008	185009	185009	I	0	" Emmeline sat very quiet for several minutes ; she was just in that mood of extreme hilarity which renders control excessively difficult , and causes the least check upon it to be felt as harsh and unkind , and almost to bring tears . She was not too perfect to escape from feeling all this , even though the person who had caused it was the mother she so dearly loved ; but she did not give way to it . A few minutes ' hard struggle , and the momentary temper was so conquered , that , with an even more than usually warm kiss , she promised to think quite seriously on all her mother said ; and , an effort far more difficult , was just as joyous as before . "
185077	185149	185150	185150	Edward	76	" Mrs. Hamilton assented , telling her she might talk as much as she pleased , with one of those peculiar smiles of approval which ever made Emmeline 's heart throb , for they always told her , that the thoughts and feelings , and secret struggle with temper , which she imagined must be known only to herself , her mother by some mysterious power had discovered , and rewarded . "

185203	185209	185194	185194	I	0	" he replied , smiling . "
185214	185218	185194	185194	I	0	" she continued , "

185328	185335	185321	185321	Edward	76	" he replied , again smiling , "

185374	185378	185358	185358	My	0	" asked Ellen ; "

185415	185416	185417	185417	You	78	" "
185426	185443	185417	185417	You	78	" said Mrs. Hamilton , so meaningly , that Emmeline 's ready mind instantly understood her . "
185485	185577	185473	185473	you	78	" Edward gave up his seat to his cousin , and Emmeline launched at once into a most animated description of the storm and the shipwreck , and the rescue ; cleverly contriving so to hide all names , as to elude the least suspicion of either the preserved or the preserver having any thing to do with herself , Ellen becoming so exceedingly interested , as to lose sight of the question which at first had struck her , what this could have to do with Emmeline 's wild spirits . "
185592	185606	185607	185607	your	78	" she said , as her cousin paused a minute to take breath ; "
185626	185627	185628	185628	I	0	" "

185818	185824	185807	185808	old Collins	227	" replied Emmeline , laughing ; "

185857	185858	185855	185855	Ellen	113	" "
185872	185873	185865	185865	Emmeline	78	" "
185909	185910	185911	185911	Edward	76	" "
185913	185917	185919	185919	he	76	" repeated Ellen , "
185926	185927	185919	185919	he	76	" "
185935	185945	185919	185919	he	76	" answered Mrs. Hamilton , cautiously , but fondly ; "
185975	185976	185965	185965	I	0	" "
185984	186039	185980	185982	this speaking witness	3137	" continued Emmeline playfully putting back Edward 's hair , that Ellen might see the scar . She understood it in a moment , and clasping her arms round her brother 's neck , as he knelt by her , tried hard to prevent emotion , but could not , and burst into tears . "
186056	186108	186046	186046	I	0	" exclaimed a rich , deep voice close beside her , and before she had time to fear his presence , she felt herself clasped with all a father 's fondness in her uncle 's arms ; her head resting on his shoulder , and his warm kiss on her cheek . "
186111	186120	186129	186129	Ellen	113	" was the only word she could speak . "
186169	186170	186141	186141	I	0	" "
186175	186176	186141	186141	I	0	" "
186245	186903	186904	186904	I	0	" In a very few minutes Ellen 's composure was so fully restored , and her heavy dread so subsided , that the relief seemed to her almost a dream . Could it be possible that it was the relative she had pictured as so harsh and stern , and pitiless to youthful error , who had drawn a chair close by her sofa , and caressingly holding her hand in his , and looking so kindly , so earnestly , in her altered face , was trying to amuse her by telling her so many entertaining things about Feroe and Mr. Morton , and his voyage home , and alluding to her brother 's courage , and prudence , and skill , in such terms as almost brought the tears again ? Mr. Hamilton was inexpressibly shocked at the change which mental and bodily suffering had wrought in his niece . There is always something peculiarly touching , and appealing to the best emotions , in youthful sorrow or suffering of any kind ; and her trial had been such an aggravated one — combining such agonized remorse , for an act , which the harshest judgment , knowing all points of the case , could scarcely pronounce as other than involuntary , with the most heroic , but perfectly unconscious self - sacrifice , and not only terror for her brother 's fate , but an almost crushing sense of misery for his faults , that the pallid face , and frame so delicately fragile , had still deeper claims for sympathy and cherishing than even when caused by ordinary illness . The loss of her unusually luxuriant hair , except the soft bands which shaded her face , visible under the pretty little lace cap , made her look much younger than she really was , and so delicately transparent had become her complexion , that the blue veins were clearly traceable on her forehead , and throat , and hands ; the dark , soft lash seemed longer than before , as it swept the pale cheek , the brow more penciled , and the eye , whether in imagination , from her friends knowing all she had endured , or in reality , was so expressive of such deep , quiet feeling , that the whole countenance was so altered and so improved , that it seemed as if the heavy , sallow child was rapidly changing into one of those sweet , lovable , heart - attracting girls , who , without any actual beauty , can never be passed unnoticed . At Ellen 's request , Mrs. Hamilton had , as soon as she was strong enough , read with her , morning and evening , the devotional exercises which were read below to the assembled family . Mrs. Hamilton soon perceived , and with no little pain , that Ellen shrunk from the idea of being well enough to rejoin them , in actual suffering . Here again was an effect of that same vivid imagination , of whose existence , until the late events , in one so quiet , seemingly so cold , Mrs. Hamilton had not the least idea of . Ellen had been so long accustomed to be silent as to her feelings , in fact , carefully to conceal them , that much as she might wish and intend to be unreserved , her aunt feared it would cause her some difficulty to be so , and she could not hope to succeed in controlling imagination , unless she were . That night , however , Ellen 's unreserved confidence gave her hope . When the devotional exercises , in which she had joined with even more than usual earnestness and fervor , were concluded , she said , with almost Emmeline 's confidence , as she laid her hand on her aunt 's — "
187042	187043	187031	187031	I	0	" "
187352	187394	187330	187330	Ellen	113	" Ellen listened eagerly , gratefully ; she felt as if , with every word Mrs. Hamilton said , the film of doubt and vague fancies was dissolving from her mind , and , after a short pause , she said — "
187505	187506	187471	187471	you	113	" "
187855	188470	188471	188471	We	3153	" The earnestness of truth and feeling was always so impressed on Mrs. Hamilton 's manner , whenever she addressed her youthful charge , that her simplest word had weight . Happy indeed is it when youth — that season of bewildering doubt and question , and vivid , often mistaken fancies , and too impetuous feeling — has the rich blessing of such affectionate counsels , such a friend . Why will not woman rise superior to the petty employments and feelings too often alone attributed to her , and endeavor to fit herself for such a thrice blessed mission ; and by sympathy with young enjoyments — young hopes — young feelings , so attract young affections , that similar counsels , similar experiences , may so help and guide , that the restless mind and eager heart quiesce into all the calm , deep , beautiful characteristics , which so shine forth in the true English wife — the true English mother ! A fortnight after Mr. Hamilton 's arrival , Ellen was well enough to go down stairs for part of the day , and even to read and write a little . She was so very anxious to recommence her studies , which for many months had been so painfully neglected , that it was a great trial to her , to find her head was not yet strong enough for the necessary application . There were many , very many privations and trials , attendant on convalescence after so severe an illness , known only to Ellen 's own heart , and to her aunt 's quick sympathy ; and she very quickly learned in them the meaning of Mrs. Hamilton 's words regarding religion in conduct and feeling , as well as in prayer . She tried never to murmur , or dwell on the wish for pleasures which were denied her , but to think only on the many blessings which surrounded her . It was not an easy task so to conquer natural feeling , especially as the trial and its conquest was often known only to herself ; but the earnest wish , indeed , to become holy in daily conduct , as well as in daily prayer , never left her mind , and so enabled her at length fully to obtain it . If Mrs. Hamilton had wanted evidence of her husband 's public as well as domestic worth , she would have had it fully now . His danger and his preservation once known , letters of regard and congratulation poured upon him , and Montrose Grahame made a journey down to Oakwood expressly to welcome back , and express his individual gratitude for his friend 's safety to his youthful preserver . But Edward so shrunk from praise or admiration , that his uncle , rejoicing at the feeling , would not press him , as he had first intended , to accompany him to Oxford , where he went to see his sons . Percy rated him soundly in a letter for not coming . Herbert seemed , as if he could only think of his father 's danger , and thank God for his safety , and for permitting Edward to be the means . So great was the desire of Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton to re - assemble all their happy family once more , before Edward left them , that the young men made an exception to their general rule , and promised to spend Easter week at home . It was early in March , and anticipated by the home party with the greatest delight . "
188494	188532	188481	188481	Ellen	113	" joyously exclaimed Emmeline , as she ran into the usual sitting room , one of those lovely afternoons , that the first days of March so often bring , promising spring long before she really comes . "
188580	188581	188583	188583	you	113	" "
188618	188619	188598	188598	You	113	" "
188653	188668	188642	188642	Emmeline	78	" rejoined the quieter Caroline , who had followed her sister into the room . "
188677	188681	188671	188671	they	3158	" asked Ellen . "
188721	188722	188707	188707	they	3158	" "
188739	188743	188732	188732	you	113	" inquired Caroline . "
188858	188859	188863	188863	Ellen	113	" "
188873	188919	188863	188863	Ellen	113	" continued Emmeline , who just at that moment was only alive to pleasure , not to contemplation , even of goodness , in which she much delighted , and pouring into her cousin 's lap a basket of beautiful shells and other marine treasures . "

189267	189295	189258	189259	Dear Emmy	121	" whispered Ellen , as she noticed Caroline 's cheek crimson . Emmeline was at her side in a moment , with an arm round her neck . "
189320	189321	189322	189322	I	0	" "

189813	189814	189803	189804	Miss Harcourt	112	" "
189830	189856	189825	189825	they	3217	" again burst forth Emmeline , who it seemed could not be quiet , going from one subject to another with the same eager zest ; "
189989	189990	189956	189956	mother	3430	" "
189993	190017	189956	189956	mother	3430	" playfully answered Mrs. Hamilton , laying her hand caressingly on her child 's mouth , as she knelt in sport before her . "

190226	190231	190201	190201	papa	160	" asked Mrs. Hamilton . "
190239	190240	190233	190233	he	3470	" "
190283	190287	190274	190274	I	0	" said Emmeline . "
190324	190325	190310	190310	Edward	76	" "
190339	190351	190327	190327	papa	160	" And , without waiting for an answer , she continued , "
190412	190413	190414	190414	I	0	" "
190429	190430	190421	190421	I	0	" "

190460	190483	190434	190434	you	0	" He stopped , and looked alternately at Mrs. Hamilton and Ellen , as if asking the former whether he might proceed . "
190495	190503	190486	190486	you	76	" she replied understanding him at once . "
190528	190529	190531	190531	aunt	1460	" "
190630	190631	190622	190622	I	0	" "
190643	190944	190639	190639	you	76	" exclaimed Emmeline , trying to laugh off the universal regret at this announcement . Ellen had looked earnestly at her brother all the time he spoke , and then turned her face away , and a few quiet tears trickled down her cheek . Edward 's arm was very quickly round her , and he whispered so many fond words and earnest assurances , united with his conviction that it would still be a whole month , perhaps more , before he should be summoned , as he had leave to remain with his family till the Sea Queen was ready to sail , that she rallied her spirits , and , after remaining very quiet for an hour , which was always her custom when she had had any struggle with herself , for the frame felt it — though neither word nor sign betrayed it — she was enabled fully to enjoy the grand delight of the evening — Percy 's and Herbert 's arrival . Easter week was indeed one of family joy and thankfulness not only that they were all permitted once more to be together but that the heavy clouds of sin and suffering had rolled away from their roof , and pleasure of the sweetest and most enduring because most domestic kind , reigned triumphant . Percy 's astonishment at Edward 's growth , and the alteration from the handsome , joyous , rosy boy , to the pale , almost care - worn looking youth ( for as long as Ellen bore such vivid traces of all she had endured for his sake , and was , as it were , the constant presence of his errors , Edward tried in vain to recover his former spirits ) , was most amusing . "
190950	190955	190945	190945	You	3250	" he would declare ; "
190987	190988	190990	190990	he	166	" "
191072	191073	191074	191074	Stuart	239	" "
191112	191119	191081	191081	Tiny	130	" he added , to himself , "
191126	191440	191081	191081	Tiny	130	" The days passed much too quickly . Emmeline wished a dozen times that the days would be twenty - four , instead of twelve hours long . The weather was so genial that it added to enjoyment , and allowed Ellen the delight , known only to such prisoners to sickness as she had been , of driving out for an hour or two at a time , and taking gentle walks on the terrace , and in the garden . The young men were to return on the Monday , and of the Saturday previous , a little excursion had been planned , to which the only drawback was that Ellen was not quite strong enough to accompany them : it was to visit Alice Seaton , whom we mentioned in a former chapter . Mr. Hamilton had succeeded in finding her brother a lucrative employment with a lawyer in one of the neighboring towns , a few miles from where she and her aunt now lived , enabling young Seaton to spend every Sabbath with them ; and Alice now kept a girls ' school on her own account , and conducted herself so well as never to want scholars . It had been a long promise to go and see her , the drive from Oakwood being also most beautiful ; and as she and her brother were both at home and at leisure the last day in Easter , it had been fixed upon for the visit . Percy was reveling in the idea of driving his mother and Miss Harcourt in a new barouche , and the rest of the party were to go on horse back . But a dispute had arisen who should stay with Ellen and Edward insisted upon it , it was his right ; and , so they thought it was agreed . "
191455	191477	191446	191446	you	99	" pleaded Ellen , fancying herself alone with him , not seeing Herbert , who was reading at a distant table . "
191490	191498	191484	191484	you	113	" he answered , mimicking her tone . "
191581	191582	191589	191589	cousin	5043	" "
191592	191601	191589	191589	cousin	5043	" replied Percy , with a low bow . "
191612	191613	191589	191589	cousin	5043	" "
191629	191630	191616	191616	I	0	" "
191678	191679	191680	191680	You	0	" "
191733	191734	191735	191736	Dear Percy	99	" "
191763	191764	191757	191757	you	99	" "
191816	191817	191807	191807	I	0	" "
191830	191848	191827	191828	dear Percy	99	" entreated his cousin , the tears starting to her eyes , as he kissed her warmly ; "
191897	191898	191892	191892	you	99	" "
191916	191929	191930	191930	You	99	" And he was going very reluctantly , when he met Herbert . "
191937	191943	191935	191935	Percy	99	" he said , smiling ; "
191971	191972	191969	191969	Ellen	113	" "
191993	191994	191983	191983	he	76	" "
191999	192005	191983	191983	he	76	" said Herbert , archly , "
192013	192014	192015	192015	You	102	" "
192017	192023	192015	192015	You	102	" repeated Ellen , surprised ; "
192041	192042	192046	192046	Ellen	113	" "
192141	192780	192139	192139	Nell	113	" Whatever Ellen might have said to convince him she could be happy alone , the beaming look of pleasure on her countenance , satisfied all parties as to the excellence of this arrangement ; and happy , indeed , the day was . Herbert seemed to understand her unexpressed feelings so fully ; and that always makes the charm of conversation , whatever its subject . We do not require the expression in words of sympathy — it is an indescribable something that betrays its existence . Favorite authors — and Herbert was almost surprised at Ellen 's dawning taste and judgment in literature — the delights of nature after a long confinement , as if every flower were more sweet , every bit of landscape , or wood , or water more beautiful , and the many holy thoughts and pure joys springing from such feelings , were all discussed , either cosily in their sitting - room , or in their ramble in the garden ; and after Ellen 's early dinner , which Herbert shared with her as lunch , she proposed , what she knew he would like , that her drive should be to Greville Manor , and they might spend a full hour with their friends , and yet be back in time . Herbert assented gladly ; and the warm welcome they received , Mrs. Greville 's kind care of Ellen , and Mary 's eager chat with her and Herbert , and the number of things they seemed to find to talk about , made the hour literally fly ; but Herbert , enjoyable as it was , did not forget his charge , and drove her back to Oakwood while the sun still shone bright and warmly : and when the party returned , which they did only just in time to dress for dinner , and in the wildest spirits , the balance of pleasure at home and abroad , would certainly have been found quite equal . Ellen still continued quietly to lie down in her own room while the family were at dinner , for she was then sufficiently refreshed to join them for a few hours in the evening . Percy and Emmeline , at dinner that day , kept up such a fire of wit and mirth , that it was somewhat difficult for any one else to edge in a word , though Edward and Caroline did sometimes contrive to bring a whole battery against themselves . Just as the dessert was placed on the table , however , sounds of rural music in the distance , advancing nearer and nearer , caused Percy to pause in his wild sallies , and spring with Edward to the window , and their exclamations soon compelled all the party to follow their example , and send for Ellen to see the unexpected sight too . Banners and pennons floated in the sunshine , and the greater part of the nautical inhabitants of Dartmouth were marshaled in goodly array beside them , headed by Captain Harvey and his crew , with old Collins in the midst of them ; they were all attired in the new clothing which Mr. Hamilton had presented to them ; and a fine picture Percy declared old Collins 's head would make , with his weather - beaten , honest - speaking face , the very peculiar curls in which his really yellow hair was twisted , and the quid of tobacco , from which , even on this grand occasion , he could not relieve his mouth and cheek . A band of young men and girls surrounded the first banner , which , adorned with large bunches of primroses and violets up the staff , bore the words , "
192785	192900	192781	192781	Hamilton	81	" and among them Emmeline speedily recognized William Grey and Susan Collins , walking side by side , she looking down and smiling , and he so earnestly talking , that she whispered to her mother with the greatest glee , that her plan would take place after all . Then came a band of sturdy fishermen , chums and messmates of Collins , and then a band of boys and girls , from all Mr. Hamilton 's own village schools , decked in their holiday attire , and holding in their hands tasteful garlands of all the spring flowers they could muster , and bearing two large banners , one with the words , "
192910	193267	193271	193272	my boy	868	" and the other a representation of the scene on the beach that eventful night , and the sinking vessel in the distance . The workmanship was rude indeed , but the effect so strikingly descriptive , that Mrs. Hamilton actually shuddered as she gazed , and grasped , almost unconsciously , the arm of her nephew as he stood by her , as if the magnitude of the danger , both to him and her husband , had never seemed so vivid before . The windows of the dining - room had been thrown widely open , and as the rustic procession came in sight of those to whom their whole hearts tendered homage , they halted ; the music ceased , and cheer on cheer resounded , till the very echoes of the old park were startled out of their sleep , and sent the shout back again . Percy was among them in a moment , singling out old Collins , whom he had tried repeatedly to see since his visit home , but never found him , and grasped and shook both his hands with the full vehemence of his character , pouring out the first words that chose to come , which better expressed his grateful feelings to the old man than the most studied speech . William Grey had already received substantial proofs of his gratitude , and so he had then only a kind nod , and a joke and look at the pretty , blushing Susan , which said a vast deal to both , and seemed as if he quite seconded Emmeline 's plan . Mingling joyously with all , he had bluff words , after their own hearts , for the men , smiles for the maidens , and such wild jokes for the children , as lost them all decorum , and made them shout aloud in their glee . Herbert seconded him quite as well as his quieter nature would allow . Edward had hung back , even when his name was called out lustily , as if he could not bear such homage . "
193285	193298	193271	193272	my boy	868	" whispered Mrs. Hamilton , earnestly , for she guessed his thoughts . "
193373	193425	193426	193426	You	868	" The cloud dispersed from brow and heart in a moment ; and he was in the midst of them , glad and buoyant almost as Percy ; while the cheer which greeted him was almost overpowering to his sister , so much humble , yet earnest feeling did it speak . "
193442	193454	193426	193426	You	868	" said Mr. Hamilton , warmly grasping Captain Harvey 's hand . "
193495	193811	193812	193812	Caroline	120	" And urged on by their own delight at this homage both to their master and his young preserver , who had become a complete idol among them , a long table was speedily laid in the servants ' hall , covered with a variety of cold meats , and bread and cheese in abundance , and horns of cider sparkling brightly beside each trencher . Fruit and cakes eagerly sought for by Emmeline , were by her distributed largely to the children , who remained variously grouped on the lawn , their glee at the treat heightened by the sweet and gentle manner of its bestowal . Captain Harvey and his mate , Mr. Hamilton entertained himself , introducing them to his family , and especially Ellen , who , as the sister of Edward , found herself regarded with an interest that surprised her . Percy brought in old Collins and Grey , both of whom had expressed such a wish to see any one so nearly belonging to the brave young sailor ; and her manner of receiving and returning their greeting , thanking them for the help they had so efficiently given her brother , made them still prouder and happier than before . After an hour and a half of thorough enjoyment — for their humble homage to worth and goodness had been received in the same spirit as it had been tendered — the procession marshaled itself in the same order as it had come ; and rude as the music was , it sounded , as Emmeline declared , really beautiful , becoming fainter and fainter in the distance , and quite picturesque the effect of the banners and pennons , as they gleamed in and out the woody windings of the park , both music and procession softened in the mild , lovely twilight of the season . "
193835	193858	193814	193814	Emmeline	78	" exclaimed Percy , as soon as lights came , and the excitement of the last two hours had a little subsided . "
193897	193898	193877	193877	I	0	" "
193904	193910	193877	193877	I	0	" said Edward , dryly . "
194059	194249	194250	194250	Your	3285	" His own way , this time , gave universal satisfaction . The talents of his sisters has been so cultivated , as a means of enhancing home - happiness , and increasing their own resources , that their musical evenings were always perfect enjoyment . Caroline , indeed , improved as she was , still retained her love of admiration sufficiently , to find still greater enjoyment in playing and singing when there were more to listen to her , than merely her own family , but the feeling , in the security and pure atmosphere of Oakwood , was kept under control , and she could find real pleasure in gratifying her brothers , though not quite to the same extent as Emmeline . Percy after comfortably settling Ellen , threw himself on the most luxurious chair that he could find , stretched out his legs , placed his head in what he called the best position for listening and enjoying , and then called for duets on the harp and piano , single pieces on both , and song after song with the most merciless rapidity . "
194262	194272	194250	194250	Your	3285	" his mother , at length , laughingly said , "
194292	194293	194294	194294	Mother	3430	" "
194317	194318	194319	194319	You	3285	" "
194345	194349	194350	194350	Caroline	120	" expostulated Edward . "
194366	194367	194368	194368	You	3285	" "
194409	194453	194397	194397	Tiny	130	" It was so very close to him as he approached the piano , that his sister comically took his hand , and placed it on it , and two or three very pretty trios were performed , Percy declared with professional éclat . "
194495	194496	194497	194497	Caroline	120	" "
194509	194510	194499	194499	I	0	" "
194558	194559	194550	194550	Emmeline	78	" "
194574	194593	194572	194572	me	0	" answered Emmeline , with a confusion and timidity , which , at home , were perfectly incomprehensible . "
194615	194621	194598	194598	Emmy	121	" said her father encouragingly . "
194632	194637	194625	194625	I	0	" still pleaded Emmeline . "
194683	194684	194685	194685	I	0	" "
194703	194709	194699	194699	Tiny	130	" said Percy , laughing . "
194727	194975	194714	194715	a MS	3299	" The words , however , seemed sufficiently satisfactory for them readily to join in it . Emmeline still hesitated , almost painfully ; but then gathering courage , she sat down to her harp , and , without any notes before her , played a few bars of one of those sweet , thrilling Irish melodies so suited to her instrument , and then commenced her song , the sweetness of her voice , and clearness of articulation atoning well for her deficiency in the power and brilliancy which characterized her sister . The words were exceedingly simple , but sung with deep feeling , and heart - appealing as they were , from the subject , we hope our readers will judge them as leniently as Emmeline 's hearers . EMMELINE 'S SONG . Emmeline 's voice had at first trembled audibly , but seeming to derive courage from her sister and brother 's accompaniment , which , from their knowledge of music , was so beautifully modulated as to permit her sweet voice to be heard above all , and every word clearly distinguished , it became firmer and more earnest as she continued , till she forgot every thing but the subject of her song . For full a minute there was silence as she ceased , but with an irresistible impulse Mr. Hamilton rose from his seat , and , as Emmeline left her harp , he clasped her in his arms . "
194995	195010	195013	195013	you	3301	" he exclaimed , with more emotion than he generally permitted to be visible . "
195027	195054	195023	195025	my little girl	3465	" he added , as , completely overcome by the excitement of her song and her father 's praise , Emmeline most unexpectedly burst into tears . "
195099	195100	195087	195087	mamma	3420	" "
195119	195174	195175	195175	She	3420	" comically demanded Percy , as Emmeline , breaking from her father , sat down on her favorite stool at her mother 's feet , and hid her face in her lap . Mrs. Hamilton laid her hand caressingly on those soft curls , but , though she smiled , she did not speak . "
195188	195194	195175	195175	She	3420	" said Caroline , laughing . "
195206	195210	195212	195212	I	0	" said Edward . "
195220	195221	195222	195222	Mother	183	" "
195231	195235	195222	195222	Mother	183	" pleaded Herbert . "
195253	195279	195249	195249	I	0	" she replied , in the same playful tone , and raising Emmeline 's lowered head , she looked a moment in those conscious eyes . "
195313	195314	195317	195317	Emmy	121	" "
195333	195348	195321	195321	mamma	3420	" said Caroline , triumphantly , as her sister 's face was again concealed . "
195368	195372	195373	195373	I	0	" spouted Percy . "
195416	195417	195427	195427	Emmy	121	" "
195429	195433	195427	195427	Emmy	121	" continued Herbert . "
195470	195549	195463	195463	I	0	" said Emmeline ; her tears changed to her most joyous smiles . Percy and his father turned directly to Caroline , the former with a Sir Charles Grandison 's bow , the other with a most affectionate kiss ; and her mother looked at her with such an expression of gratified pleasure , that she could not help acknowledging to herself , such pure enjoyment was not to be found in the praise and admiration of strangers . "
195562	195566	195554	195554	you	78	" said Edward . "
195585	195586	195569	195569	you	78	" "
195596	195601	195589	195589	I	0	" answered Mrs. Hamilton ; "
195622	195623	195624	195624	I	0	" "
195629	195635	195626	195626	I	0	" said Ellen , timidly ; "
195678	195679	195660	195660	she	78	" "
195689	195710	195682	195682	you	0	" hastily answered Emmeline , forgetting , in her surprise at her cousin 's penetration , that she betrayed herself . "
195719	195725	195712	195712	I	0	" said Ellen , simply . "
195949	195950	195942	195942	Caroline	120	" "
195960	196026	195953	195953	I	0	" exclaimed Percy , who , in his sister 's absorbed attention , had neared her unobserved , and catching her round the waist , bore her to the upper end of the room , and a minute afterward she was enjoying her waltz , with as much childish glee , as if neither poetry nor reflection could have any thing to do with her . "
196037	196052	195953	195953	I	0	" inquired Ellen , who had listened earnestly to all Mrs. Hamilton had said . "
196332	196535	196536	196536	You	3333	" Ellen listened eagerly , and they continued conversing on many similar topics of interest and improvement , till the prayer bell rang , and startled her into the recollection that she had always retired nearly an hour before , and so had avoided entering the library , which she still quite shrunk from . Percy stopped his dance , which he had converted from a waltz into a most inspiring gallopade , the last importation , he declared , from Almack 's ; Miss Harcourt closed the piano ; and Herbert paused in his conversation with his father . Nothing like gloom ever marked the signal for the hour of devotion , but lighter pleasures always ceased a few minutes before , that they might better realize the more serious thought and service . Mrs. Hamilton had never ceased to regret the disgrace she had inflicted on Ellen , in not permitting her to retain her own place with the family , at least in the hours of devotion , for it seemed more difficult to remove that impression than any of her other trials . Returning her niece 's startled look with one of the sincerest affection , she said — "
196553	196554	196560	196560	aunt	1460	" "
196562	196563	196560	196560	aunt	1460	" "
196634	196635	196636	196636	Forgiven!—you	3339	" "
196638	196650	196651	196652	Aunt Emmeline	78	" repeated Ellen , in utter astonishment , but rising instantly . "
196705	197219	197225	197225	you	3341	" Mrs. Hamilton drew her arm fondly in hers , refusing for her the aid of either of the young men , who had all hastened toward her , and led her herself to the library , and to her usual place beside Emmeline . Many an eager but respectful look of affectionate admiration was directed toward her by the assembled household , the greater part of whom had not seen her since the night of Edward 's confession ; and the alteration in her appearance , the universal sympathy which her dangerous illness and its cause had called forth , even in the humblest and most ignorant — for it is the heart , not the mind , which is required for the comprehension of self - devotion — her very youth seeming to increase its magnitude , had inspired such a feeling of love , that could she have known it , would have prevented that painful sensation of shyness . Many , many thoughts thronged her mind , as her uncle 's impressive voice fell on her ear ; thoughts which , though they prevented her following the words of the prayers , and caused the tears , spite of every effort , to stream through her slender fingers , yet turned into thankfulness and praise , ere the service ceased , that , fiery as the ordeal had been , she could still recognize a hand of love , and bless God , not only for the detection of her involuntary sin , but for every pang she had endured . The next day was Sunday , bringing with it all sorts of quiet , sober pleasures of its own , only alloyed by the thought that it was the last day of Percy 's and Herbert 's visit . The following morning they started for Oxford , Mr. Hamilton and Edward intending to accompany them part of the way , and then to proceed to Ashburton , where the former had business , and then make a little tour through Plymouth home . The next day was so beautifully fine and genial , that Emmeline declared it would do Ellen the greatest possible good to go with her a few miles out of the park , to see a waterfall she had lately discovered , and which she had been longing for Ellen to see , as Caroline would not admire it as much as it deserved . Miss Harcourt accompanied them , and on their return , its beauties were described to Mrs. Hamilton in the most animating strain ; Emmeline declaring the air was more deliciously fresh , the trees more green , the sky more brilliantly blue , than they had ever been before ; and that the very sound of the water , as it dashed down a black rock , and threw up spray , which the rays of the sun rendered so beautifully iridescent , as to seem like a succession of rainbows , was a whole volume of poetry in itself . "
197307	197308	197309	197309	I	0	" "
197319	197334	197312	197312	I	0	" said Ellen ( whom her aunt now observed looked agitated and flushed ) ; "
197350	197351	197312	197312	I	0	" "
197387	197392	197393	197393	She	3350	" said Mrs. Hamilton . "
197400	197413	197393	197393	She	3350	" exclaimed Caroline , who was standing at one of the windows ; "
197440	197544	197545	197545	You	3352	" Mr. Hamilton and Edward entered almost immediately afterward , the latter evidently very much agitated , the former so tranquil and cheerful that the momentary anxiety of his wife was calmed directly . He laughed at their bewilderment , and said that an important letter had reached him at Ashburton , summoning him to Plymouth , and so he thought he would just see how all was going on at Oakwood first . This was not at all a satisfactory reason from Mr. Hamilton . Edward evidently tried to answer Ellen 's inquiries quietly , but he could not , and exclaiming , "
197557	197632	197553	197553	I	0	" ran out of the room . Mr. Hamilton instantly changed his jesting manner , so far as quietly and affectionately to seat his niece beside him , and tell her , cautiously and kindly , the real cause of their unexpected return . Orders had been sent to the Sea Queen , to sail much sooner than was expected , and therefore he had deferred his business , and returned with Edward directly . "
197697	197698	197695	197695	you	113	" "
197711	197737	197738	197740	The Sea Queen	3247	" was all poor Ellen could ask ; but in such a tone of quiet sorrow , her uncle could not for the moment reply . "
197764	197884	197755	197755	Edward	76	" A low cry escaped involuntarily from Ellen 's lips , as she buried her face on the cushion of the couch where she was sitting , and an exclamation of surprise and regret broke from all . Mrs. Hamilton felt it almost as much as Ellen , from not only her own unspoken anxiety , as to whether indeed his home influence would save him from temptation in future , but that she could enter into every thought and feeling which in Ellen must so aggravate the actual parting — always a sorrow in itself . After a few minutes Ellen raised her head , and , though her cheek was perfectly colorless , every tear was checked . "
197897	197908	197895	197895	Emmeline	78	" she said , trying hard to speak quite calmly . "
197936	198206	198207	198207	I	0	" And , effort as it was , she kept her word ; so controlling sorrow , to enter into his naturally glad anticipations , that her brother felt as if he could not love , nor venerate her enough . He was obliged to leave Oakwood ( accompanied by his uncle ) so early the next morning , that all his preparations had to be completed by that night . Ellis 's activity , though she could not endure the idea of his going , speedily and satisfactorily settled that matter . Robert Langford , who had only regained his natural light - heartedness since Ellen had taken her usual place in the family , always declaring his carelessness had been the origin of all her misery , was another so active in his service , that Edward had only to give a hint of any thing he wanted , even if it could only be procured at some distance , and it was instantly obtained . The hours wore on , the evening devotions were concluded , but still the family lingered in the library : so many things there seemed to say , for Mr. Hamilton and Miss Harcourt would not let the conversation flag , and Edward would talk and laugh , as if he were only going from home for a few days . Midnight chimed , but still Mrs. Hamilton felt as if she could not give the signal for separation : but when one struck , there was a general start , and an unanimous declaration it could not be so late . "
198213	198219	198207	198207	I	0	" Mrs. Hamilton cheerfully said ; "
198284	198340	198259	198259	Ellen	113	" She spoke kindly , but firmly , and there was a general move . Edward laughingly promised to send his cousins the very best box of rouge he could procure at Plymouth , and wished them good night as gayly as if they should meet as usual the next morning . Once only his voice faltered—"Ellen
198357	198518	198351	198351	God	85	" were all he said , the last sentence escaping as if involuntarily , as if he had merely meant to say good night ; and for more than a minute the brother and sister were clasped in each other 's arms . There were tears in Mrs. Hamilton 's eyes , and her husband 's were most unwontedly dim , for words were not needed to reveal to them the trial of that moment to those two young hearts . To Ellen 's especially , for her lot was woman's — to endure until time should prove the reality of Edward 's resolution , and mark him indeed the noble character his disposition so fondly promised . His was active service , the banishment of thought by deed . Breaking from her brother , and not daring to address either her aunt or uncle , lest her control should fail her too soon , Ellen hastened from the room . "
198541	198559	198530	198530	I	0	" implored Edward , as soon as he could speak , and clasping his aunt 's hand . "
198601	198602	198603	198603	She	3363	" "
198678	198949	198950	198950	I	0	" Mrs. Hamilton knew the human heart well . When she went to Ellen , the paroxysm of natural sorrow had had vent , and her sympathy , her earnestly expressed conviction that the trial of beholding error and remorse in one so beloved would not occur again , could bring comfort . The tears indeed might still have flowed the faster , perhaps , at the voice of kindness , but there was healing in them ; and when her aunt left her to go to Edward , she sent him a fond message that she was better , and in a few days would be happy , quite happy , for his sake . It was late before Mrs. Hamilton quitted her nephew . We will not repeat all that passed between them , all that that fond watchful relative so earnestly , so appealingly said . Not much in actual words of counsel had she ever before addressed to him , feeling that that duty was better performed by Mr. Howard and his uncle . She had simply tried to influence him by the power of love , of forbearance , of sympathy with his remorse , and pity for his errors . In the wretchedness , the fearful anxiety , Ellen 's danger and painful illness had occasioned herself individually , she had never spoken , or even let fall a sentence which could reproach him as the cause of all ; and therefore , now that she did give her anxious affection words , they were so spoken , that her nephew never forgot them . "
198954	198966	198950	198950	I	0	" he had said , near the conclusion of their interview , "
199029	199030	199036	199036	they	3369	" "
199285	199291	199292	199293	Charles Manvers	245	" Edward opened it eagerly , "
199295	199299	199292	199293	Charles Manvers	245	" he exclaimed ; "
199341	199342	199343	199343	He	3383	" "
199419	199463	199464	199464	I	0	" Her voice faltered , for even yet the memory of her brother was so dear to her that she could never speak of him without emotion . Edward reiterated his eager assurance that it should be equally valuable to him , adding — "
199524	199525	199551	199551	Edward	76	" "
199795	200907	200908	200908	You	3398	" Edward did promise , but his heart was so full he could not restrain himself any longer , and as Mrs. Hamilton folded him to her heart , in a silent but tearful embrace , he wept on her shoulder like a child . Brightly and placidly , as the course of their own beautiful river , did the days now pass to the inmates of Oakwood . Letters came from Edward so frequently , so happily , that hope would rest calmly , joyously , even on the thought of him . He never let an opportunity pass , writing always to Mrs. Hamilton ( which he had scarcely ever done before ) , and inclosing his letters to Ellen open in hers . The tone , the frequency , were so changed from his last , that his family now wondered they had been so blind before in not perceiving that his very seeming liveliness was unnatural and overstrained . With Ellen , too , Mrs. Hamilton 's anxious care was bringing in fair promise of success — the mistaken influences of her childhood , and their increased effect from a morbid imagination , produced from constant suffering , appearing , indeed , about to be wholly eradicated . Anxious to remove all sad associations connected with the library , Mrs. Hamilton having determined herself to superintend Ellen 's studies , passed long mornings in that ancient room with her , so delightfully , that it became associated only with the noble authors whose works , or extracts from whom , she read and reveled in , and which filled her mind with such new thoughts , such expansive ideas , such calming and earnest truths , that she felt becoming to herself a new being . Lively and thoughtless as Emmeline she could not now indeed become — alike as their dispositions naturally were ; but she was more quietly , enduringly happy than she had ever remembered her self . There was only one alloy , one sad thought , that would intrude causing a resolution , which none suspected ; for , open as she had become , she could breathe it to none but Ellis , for she alone could assist her , though it required many persuasions and many assurances , that she never could be quite happy , unless it was accomplished , which could prevail on her to grant it . Ellen knew , felt , more and more each week , that she could not rest till she had labored for and obtained , and returned into her aunt 's hands the full sum she had so involuntarily appropriated . The only means she could adopt demanded such a seemingly interminable period of self - denial , patience , and perseverance , that at first as Ellis represented and magnified all connected with it , she felt as if , indeed , she could not nerve herself for the task , much as she desired to perform it ; but prayer enabled her to face the idea , till it lost its most painful aspect , and three months after Edward 's departure she commenced the undertaking , resolved that neither time nor difficulty should deter her from its accomplishment . What her plan was , and whether it succeeded , we may not here inform our readers . Should we be permitted to resume our History of the Hamilton Family , both will be revealed . Greatly to Caroline 's delight , the following October was fixed for them to leave Oakwood , and , after a pleasant tour , to make the long anticipated visit to London . There would then be three or four months ' quiet for her to have the benefit of masters , before she was introduced , and Mrs. Hamilton fondly hoped , that the last year 's residence at home , fraught as it had been with so much of domestic trial , and displaying so many hopeful and admirable traits in Caroline 's disposition , would have lessened the danger of the ordeal of admiration and gayety which she so dreaded for her child — whether it had or not , a future page will disclose . To Emmeline this arrangement was a source of extreme regret , individually , in which Ellen now quite sympathized . But Emmeline had never forgotten her mother 's gentle hint , that too great indulgence of regret or sorrow becomes selfishness , and she tried very hard to create some anticipation of pleasure , even in London . Ellen would not look to pleasure , but merely tried to think about — and so , when called upon , cheerfully to resign that which was now so intensely enjoyable — her studies with her aunt — and so benefit by them as to give Miss Harcourt no trouble when she was again under her care ; as she knew she and Emmeline must be , more than they had been yet , when Caroline 's introduction , and their residence in London , would take Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton so much from domestic pursuits and pleasures , and , even when at home , compel them to be so frequently engrossed with a large circle of friends , and all the variety of claims on their attention and time , which a season in London includes . It was again the 7th of June , and Ellen 's birthday . Accustomed from the time she became an inmate of Oakwood to regard the anniversary of her birth in the same serious light as Mrs. Hamilton had taught her cousins — as a day of quiet reflection , as well as of thankfulness and joy , as one that , closing and recommencing another year of their individual lives , taught them that they were becoming more and more responsible beings — it was not much wonder that Ellen , the whole of that day , should seem somewhat less cheerful than usual . She had indeed had many sources of thankfulness and joy during the past year , but a heart and mind like hers could not recall its principal event without a return of sorrow . Mrs. Hamilton would not notice her now unusual sadness until the evening , when perceiving her standing engrossed in thought beside one of the widely - opened windows , near which Caroline was watering some lovely flowers on the terrace , she gently approached her , and , putting her arm round her , said , fondly — "
200971	200972	200955	200955	you	3398	" "
200994	200995	200988	200989	aunt Emmeline	78	" "
201005	201006	200988	200989	aunt Emmeline	78	" "
201024	201044	201045	201045	I	0	" replied Ellen , with a sudden burst of emotion , most unusual to her controlled and gentle character ; "
201199	201200	201202	201202	you	3398	" "
201229	201256	201218	201219	Miss Edgeworth	246	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , more affected than she chose to betray , though she drew her niece closer to her , and kissed her fondly . "
201375	201393	201394	201394	Mamma	3420	" She was interrupted by the entrance of Emmeline , with a small parcel in her hand . "
201461	201462	201459	201459	myself	0	" "
201541	201615	201534	201534	Ellen	113	" And opening the parcel as she spoke , a very pretty jewel - case appeared , containing the watch , cross , and all the other trinkets Ellen had placed in Mrs. Langford 's hand , and never had had the courage to inquire for , and the few her aunt had kept for her , but so prettily arranged and beautifully burnished , that she would scarcely have known them again . "
201641	201642	201634	201634	you	1285	" "
201654	201663	201664	201664	I	0	" replied Ellen , with a quivering lip . "
201681	201682	201683	201683	I	0	" "
201725	201749	201698	201698	Ellen	113	" and , lifting the upper tray , she took out a gold chain , and a pair of bracelets of chaste and beautiful workmanship—"that
201775	201805	201767	201767	I	0	" she added , in an earnest lower tone , as Ellen tried to speak her thanks , but could only cling to her aunt 's neck and weep . "
201832	201833	201809	201809	you	113	" "
201845	201875	201876	201876	Mamma	80	" said Emmeline joyously , as her cousin gave the required promise , so eagerly , that it was evident , she felt how much security dwelt in it . "
201901	201902	201894	201894	Zenobia	249	" "
201914	201944	201905	201905	you	0	" replied Mrs. Hamilton , smiling , as she granted her request , by throwing the chain round Ellen 's neck , and fastening the bracelets on her wrists . "
