147	152	154	155	a nun	103	“ She is praying , ”
162	168	172	172	she	103	“ you had better wait ; ”
404	422	738	739	the Superior	109	“ Has Louisa finished the marking of all your shifts , my dear ? Are they ready ? ”
423	433	435	435	Elinor	21	“ Yes , dear Mother , and packed up , ”
437	448	435	435	Elinor	21	“ And have you heard whether Madame Néotte is come . ”
449	466	738	739	the Superior	109	“ Yes , that is what I came here to tell you , as you desired . ”
467	474	476	477	the Superior	109	“ Then to‐morrow you leave us , ”
484	493	495	495	Elinor	21	“ It is you who have determined it , ”
497	514	495	495	Elinor	21	“ Ah , my child ! your guardian believes it best ; it is his doing . ”
515	522	524	525	the girl	114	“ And I shall come back , ”
527	632	524	525	the girl	114	“ No , dear , you will never do that . I know your feelings better than you do . It will be a hard parting with us all , but when you are away you will be glad . You will enjoy the world , you will choose it , and you will be welcome in it . No ; you will never wish to come back here . I have known many gentle girls like you , who could not find what they wanted here . They require to be carried along — not to walk alone , as in a convent . ”
633	640	642	642	Elinor	21	“ Am I one of those , ”
656	664	642	642	Elinor	21	“ I who have been so happy ? ”
665	702	524	525	the girl	114	“ And have made us all happy — but you must go . Sit down a little while , let us talk for the last time . The world is full of snares , my dear . ”
703	708	710	710	Elinor	21	“ What are they ? ”
712	721	710	710	Elinor	21	“ What will they tempt me to do ? ”
722	736	738	739	the Superior	109	“ Vanity , the pride of life , the lusts of the devil , ”
741	789	738	739	the Superior	109	“ You must be prepared for all . Some will pretend that you have beauty ; some will praise your voice , as if you were a musician ; some will talk to you of the world — and all , all for their own bad ends . ”
790	796	798	798	Elinor	21	“ What are those ends ? ”
810	813	815	815	she	119	“ Man , ”
819	962	815	815	she	119	“ is a creature going about to devour . Listen not to him , go not near him , keep him far from you . He will hurt you , he will destroy you ; you have already learned this ; now is your time to practise . Keep your eyes from his face , keep your speech from his commerce . One day it may come to pass that your guardian may select one who is to be your husband . Then submit yourself to the will of your superiors , and adopt the state of life which shall be allotted you ; but till such a fate is brought to your door , remember that a maiden must keep her finger on her lips and her heart full of thoughts holy and virtuous , avoiding the very shadow of sin . ”
1909	1916	1917	1917	she	151	“ Let us ride this afternoon , ”
1926	1935	1917	1917	she	151	“ the air of the house burns one . ”
1936	1942	1944	1944	Leslie	24	“ With all my heart , ”
1946	1954	1944	1944	Leslie	24	“ but we shall have a storm . ”
1955	1961	1963	1963	Laura	26	“ I am not afraid , ”
1965	1981	1963	1963	Laura	26	“ Would I were quite sure that , in fact , you have no fears ! ”
1982	2015	1917	1917	she	151	“ Oh ! I would tell them . I am very frank , I hate concealment . It is very hard on women that they are required to be liars and deceivers . ”
2016	2024	2026	2026	Leslie	24	“ But that ’s not the case , ”
2028	2055	2026	2026	Leslie	24	“ what is so delightful to a man as a frank , open nature which prints its thoughts as fast as they come into the mind . ”
2056	2094	1917	1917	she	151	“ So you say , but you know it is not so — at least , not unless a woman has no thought whatever , except the price of a dress or the hope of a ball . ”
2095	2110	2112	2112	Leslie	24	“ Oh , that would not pay the expense of printing or reading either , ”
2114	2132	2112	2112	Leslie	24	“ but what has this to do with your first plan of riding ? Shall we go ? ”
2133	2167	2178	2179	Mrs. Axross	27	“ Yes ; Mrs. Axross , you will ride ? and Captain Bertham — ring ; the horses are ready in case we should want them . Come and put on your habit . ”
2274	2285	2286	2286	she	29	“ How I hate a horse that ca n’t walk , ”
2309	2317	2319	2319	Leslie	24	“ Well , then let us gallop , ”
2330	2334	2335	2335	he	24	“ My companion , ”
2343	2368	2335	2335	he	24	“ thinks only of keeping her seat . When she gets home safe , she will have fulfilled the sole purpose of riding out . ”
2369	2378	2380	2380	Laura	26	“ Well , I ’m better than that , ”
2387	2406	2380	2380	Laura	26	“ I can enjoy all when there is anything to enjoy — but Captain Bertham is so stupid . ”
2433	2445	2447	2447	he	24	“ How can anyone be dull with you for a companion , ”
2489	2496	2498	2498	Leslie	24	“ Here come the great raindrops , ”
2511	2532	2498	2498	Leslie	24	“ Oh , no ! it is only the last of a shower . See , it is blowing over . ”
2533	2554	2470	2470	she	26	“ I do n’t see it at all , but if you order me to see it , I will . ”
2555	2561	2563	2563	Laura	26	“ I do , then , ”
2567	2574	2563	2563	Laura	26	“ so let us go on . ”
2575	2582	2584	2584	Leslie	24	“ Was that lightning or not ? ”
2600	2605	2607	2607	Laura	26	“ It was not , ”
2609	2613	2607	2607	Laura	26	“ come on . ”
2614	2629	2563	2563	Laura	26	“ On , on , to the end of the world under your guidance . ”
2642	2649	2651	2651	Laura	26	“ What will Mrs. Axross do , ”
2655	2684	2651	2651	Laura	26	“ she will walk her horse all the way home , for fear he should jump at the storm . We must turn back and look for them . ”
2743	2752	2753	2753	she	26	“ They will get lost in the wood , ”
2756	2790	2753	2753	she	26	“ and what will Mr. Axross say , if we go home without his wife ? Let us canter up here and set them right . We shall overtake them in a minute . ”
2791	2798	2800	2800	Leslie	24	“ You will be wet through , ”
2802	2810	2800	2800	Leslie	24	“ No , no , canter home ! ”
2811	2823	2753	2753	she	26	“ I do n’t care ; go home if you like . ”
2824	2835	2837	2837	Leslie	24	“ No , I am yours , to the very skin ”
2868	2875	2877	2878	the lady	174	“ They have taken shelter there , ”
2880	2896	2877	2878	the lady	174	“ no doubt . Come , let us see if they are to be found ; ”
2923	2938	2903	2903	she	174	“ My friends are here , are not they ? Come , Mr. Leslie . ”
2991	3005	3006	3006	she	174	“ The weather is too bad to stay in , is not it ? ”
3014	3024	3026	3026	she	174	“ Let us wait till the storm goes by ; ”
3032	3039	3041	3041	Leslie	24	“ A lucky storm for me , ”
3049	3068	3041	3041	Leslie	24	“ Why are these lovely tresses locked up in ribbon and garlands — not always thus delightfully visible ? ”
3122	3127	3129	3129	he	175	“ All this time , ”
3142	3150	3129	3129	he	175	“ what is become of Mrs. Axross ? ”
3151	3158	3160	3160	Laura	26	“ I had almost forgotten her , ”
3169	3176	3178	3178	Leslie	24	“ I had quite done so , ”
3183	3189	3191	3191	Laura	26	“ Only you recollected her , ”
3197	3247	3191	3191	Laura	26	“ Nay , the storm is over . It is getting late . I would not have you catch cold for the world — I would not be responsible for the anxiety your absence will create — I would not have you exposed to further rain — I would ...... ”
3248	3256	3258	3258	Laura	26	“ Get home in time for dinner , ”
3276	3290	3267	3267	she	26	“ which would be an excellent thing , for I am very hungry . ”
3291	3299	3301	3301	Leslie	24	“ Then heaven forbid you should wait ! ”
3303	3313	3301	3301	Leslie	24	“ I ’ll fetch the horses in a moment . ”
3382	3389	3390	3390	she	26	“ How very handsome he is , ”
3402	3430	3390	3390	she	26	“ how agreeable — and I do n’t feel sure he will make himself agreeable next time — that makes one curious to be with him again . ”
3442	3449	3431	3432	The butler	186	“ Miss Elinor Ladylift was arrived . ”
3450	3457	3459	3459	she	26	“ Ha ! our little nun , ”
3467	3481	3459	3459	she	26	“ we did not expect her till to‐morrow . Come and see her . ”
3550	3586	3690	3690	Laura	26	“ Oh ! my dear , I did not know you would be here to‐day . I beg your pardon for not being here to receive you . You forgive me , do n’t you ? ”
3587	3590	3690	3690	Laura	26	“ Yes ! ”
3602	3632	3598	3599	Miss Chanson	29	“ That ’s all right ! Then come along with me , for I am wet through : you would not have me die of cold , would you ? ”
3633	3636	3690	3690	Laura	26	“ No ! ”
3641	3671	3690	3690	Laura	26	“ Right , again ! I ’ll show you your room — but first I ’ll present Mr. Leslie to you . This is Mr. Leslie , my dear . ”
3672	3676	3690	3690	Laura	26	“ Is it ? ”
3682	3687	3690	3690	Laura	26	“ Yes , indeed ! ”
3715	3751	3753	3753	she	26	“ There ’s no fear that she will captivate any one whom I choose for myself , especially such a man as that , so brilliant himself , and so fond of intellect and manner , ”
3783	3797	3803	3803	she	29	“ She is tired and frightened , and wo n’t come to dinner , ”
3810	3826	3803	3803	she	29	“ No wonder ! the inside of a convent is all she knows of life . ”
3827	3834	3836	3837	her brother	195	“ What does she look like ? ”
3874	3883	3885	3885	Laura	26	“ She is a pale , slight girl , ”
3887	3913	3885	3885	Laura	26	“ and expects to be devoured by all of us . She has the least possible French accent , and moves about like a mouse . ”
4222	4236	4238	4238	she	21	“ My dear child , if you like that place , keep it , ”
4240	4267	4238	4238	she	21	“ the lamp suits your work , and I must go to talk to that stupid old lady , whom it is my duty to amuse . ”
4268	4273	4275	4275	Elinor	21	“ Shall I go , ”
4277	4291	4275	4275	Elinor	21	“ They always used to send me to talk to Madame Les Forces . ”
4292	4297	4299	4299	Laura	26	“ Did you succeed ? ”
4304	4309	4299	4299	Laura	26	“ Yes , sometimes . ”
4310	4325	4275	4275	Elinor	21	“ But you do n’t know this lady — shall you have the courage ? ”
4326	4330	4275	4275	Elinor	21	“ Why not ? ”
4331	4344	4299	4299	Laura	26	“ Nay , you will not speak one syllable to Mr. Leslie . ”
4345	4348	4275	4275	Elinor	21	“ No ! ”
4349	4353	4355	4355	Laura	26	“ And why ? ”
4357	4367	4355	4355	Laura	26	“ I talk to him — we all talk . ”
4368	4377	4299	4299	Laura	26	“ The Reverend Mother said I must not . ”
4378	4390	4392	4392	Leslie	24	“ Did she say you might speak to none but women ? ”
4397	4400	4392	4392	Leslie	24	“ Yes ! ”
4401	4408	4410	4410	Laura	26	“ Oh ! that ’s excellent ! ”
4412	4444	4410	4410	Laura	26	“ My dear nun , you must get rid of some of those maxims ; you are in a very different place from your nunnery . Do n’t make yourself ridiculous . ”
4512	4519	4521	4522	Miss Chanson	29	“ What a quaint little creature ! ”
4524	4546	4521	4522	Miss Chanson	29	“ But now I ’ll do my part to amuse the other stupid people , by giving you all some music . ”
4547	4550	4552	4553	Mr. Leslie	24	“ Do , ”
4555	4574	4552	4553	Mr. Leslie	24	“ though you know I am so lost in dulness as to talk most when music is best . ”
4575	4592	4593	4593	She	107	“ I know that ; but at all events I entertain you even in that case . ”
4720	4756	4708	4708	he	24	“ You perceive , Miss Ladylift , that they are all tired , and can play and sing no more . You ought to assist them — you ought to help in amusing us all . ”
4778	4788	4789	4789	she	21	“ Mr. Leslie told me I ought to sing , ”
4792	4796	4789	4789	she	21	“ Ought I ? ”
4797	4813	4862	4862	Elinor	21	“ To be sure , if you can . But what — not psalm tunes ? ”
4814	4837	4789	4789	she	21	“ Very well , I will not . I know a great many airs which Frère du Lap taught all the pensionnaires . ”
4838	4852	4854	4854	Laura	26	“ I should like to hear Frère du Lap ’s scholar very much , ”
4856	4860	4862	4862	Elinor	21	“ Should you ? ”
4900	4920	4895	4895	she	21	“ It were the bul‐bul , but his throat , Tho ’ sweet , ne’er uttered such a note . ”
5206	5241	5201	5201	he	24	“ That song is one I shall never forget . I shall hear many more , I hope , but the first time one listens to a perfect thing it is remembered for ever . ”
5247	5257	5201	5201	he	24	“ My Mother told me you would say so . ”
5258	5275	5201	5201	he	24	“ That I should say so ? How could the Holy Mother know anything of me ? ”
5276	5285	5201	5201	he	24	“ Not of you , but of all . ”
5286	5310	5201	5201	he	24	“ She could , only say that all of us should be aware you have one of the finest voices in the world . ”
5311	5329	5201	5201	he	24	“ Yes , she did say so — that you would try to persuade me of it . ”
5330	5360	5362	5362	he	218	“ I do n’t wish it to be thought of me that I would persuade any one to believe an untrue thing . Let us consider for a moment , ”
5390	5400	5362	5362	he	218	“ You have heard the music of this evening ? ”
5401	5404	5201	5201	he	24	“ Yes ! ”
5405	5415	5201	5201	he	24	“ It was very good , was it not ? ”
5416	5429	5362	5362	he	218	“ Very good , very strong ; I never heard such before . ”
5430	5441	5201	5201	he	24	“ But was there any voice as expressive as yours ? ”
5442	5445	5201	5201	he	24	“ No ! ”
5446	5474	5362	5362	he	218	“ Or that was so unlike a flute , or an organ , or a harp , but was so purely human ; the perfection of human . ”
5475	5484	5201	5201	he	24	“ I can not hear my own voice . ”
5485	5494	5497	5497	she	219	“ Surely , Miss Ladylift , you can . ”
5560	5567	5569	5569	he	218	“ You can if you will , ”
5571	5611	5569	5569	he	218	“ every‐ body can judge themselves as well as they can judge other people , if they will be honest to themselves . And it is not being honest , to think worse of oneself than is the truth . ”
5612	5630	5569	5569	he	218	“ My dear Mother told me my voice was such a voice as hundreds of others have . ”
5631	5639	5569	5569	he	218	“ But what do you think yourself ? ”
5640	5645	5647	5647	Elinor	21	“ I believe her , ”
5649	5654	5656	5656	Leslie	24	“ Yes , surely , ”
5664	5758	5656	5656	Leslie	24	“ She spoke her entire conviction , no doubt ; still she judged from her Convent alone . There , perhaps , where all is holy , all dedicated to divine things , the inhabitants may be blessed , many of them , with gifts like the one you have in your voice ; but it is not so in the world . You are in the world now ; you must judge by what you see and hear ; you may find there are things unlike those which the Reverend Mother knows . ”
5759	5768	5770	5770	Elinor	21	“ Oh ! she can not be mistaken , ”
5772	5780	5782	5782	Leslie	24	“ Only ask yourself whether she is , ”
5784	5803	5782	5782	Leslie	24	“ If so , some things which were good guides in the convent , may lead wrong here . ”
5838	5846	5835	5835	she	21	“ Who can I trust , then ? ”
5847	5854	5856	5856	Leslie	24	“ I know this outer world , ”
5858	5866	5868	5868	Elinor	21	“ But I do not know you , ”
5870	5916	5868	5868	Elinor	21	“ I know nobody . I will do my best ; you must not try to prevent me . If you liked my singing , I am glad of that ; but perhaps you do not understand music , and then you can not judge . ”
5917	5925	5927	5927	Leslie	24	“ No , perhaps I do not , ”
5929	5941	5927	5927	Leslie	24	“ you know I can only say what I honestly feel . ”
5942	5959	5961	5961	Elinor	21	“ Yes , to be sure ! I know you do that . Everybody does that , ”
6072	6084	6086	6086	she	26	“ You have persuaded the nun to talk , Mr. Leslie , ”
6088	6094	6086	6086	she	26	“ how clever you are . ”
6095	6111	6113	6114	Mr. Leslie	24	“ It gives one an interest in succeeding , when the task is so difficult , ”
6116	6146	6113	6114	Mr. Leslie	24	“ No doubt ; a woman who has the audacity to know or feel anything , and to say it , must expect the contempt of the nobler sex . ”
6147	6152	6154	6154	Leslie	24	“ Why so ? , ”
6158	6193	6154	6154	Leslie	24	“ Men are so short‐sighted , so easily taken in . If women affect simplicity and reserve , men see no further than just what those women give themselves the trouble to put on . ”
6194	6202	6113	6114	Mr. Leslie	24	“ Is that little girl a dissembler ? ”
6203	6212	6113	6114	Mr. Leslie	24	“ Oh ! I suppose you can judge . ”
6213	6224	6154	6154	Leslie	24	“ I should judge not ; but you know best . ”
6225	6240	6242	6242	Laura	26	“ If I knew anything , I would not say it against my friend , ”
6244	6253	6242	6242	Laura	26	“ My nature is more constant than that . ”
6254	6260	6262	6262	Leslie	24	“ More generous than that , ”
6264	6284	6262	6262	Leslie	24	“ constant is not the word , for your acquaintance is so short . It is indeed very generous . ”
6414	6417	6419	6419	Leslie	24	“ Suppose , ”
6421	6442	6419	6419	Leslie	24	“ we show the wood‐walk to Miss Ladylift . Would it not be a good employment of this delightful morning ? ”
6581	6590	6592	6592	she	21	“ Shall we know how to go back , ”
6594	6601	6592	6592	she	21	“ but no doubt you will . ”
6602	6608	6610	6610	Laura	26	“ No fear of that , ”
6622	6629	6610	6610	Laura	26	“ the way is not difficult . ”
6630	6642	6644	6644	Elinor	21	“ And may you go here as far as you like ? ”
6652	6658	6660	6660	Laura	26	“ Who can doubt that ? ”
6664	6691	6660	6660	Laura	26	“ or that you may do so likewise ? In a Convent they are children all their lives ; but you must take off your leading‐strings . ”
6877	6886	6887	6887	she	26	“ I wish I could do like you , ”
6890	6899	6887	6887	she	26	“ but I have not learned to walk . ”
6900	6904	6906	6906	Laura	26	“ Dear baby , ”
6908	6920	6906	6906	Laura	26	“ still at nurse ? I wish I could carry you ! ”
6948	6957	6959	6959	he	24	“ It is a science you must practise , ”
6961	6977	6959	6959	he	24	“ It was a fault not to have attended to your education in that respect . ”
7093	7099	7101	7101	Laura	26	“ Unless you are afraid , ”
7108	7124	7126	7126	Elinor	21	“ No , I am not afraid , for you say there is no danger , ”
7229	7253	7254	7254	He	24	“ Meantime , what have we done with your ward , your nursling ? Is not it time to go back for her ? ”
7289	7297	7299	7299	Laura	26	“ What ! had you forgotten her ? ”
7301	7310	7312	7312	Leslie	24	“ Could I think of more than one ? ”
7320	7329	7331	7331	Laura	26	“ And that one was of course absent , ”
7333	7339	7341	7341	Leslie	24	“ Ah ! I see , ”
7348	7360	7361	7361	he	24	“ that I am little understood . But at this moment , ”
7368	7393	7365	7365	his	24	“ however that may be , we must run back to take up our charge , for do you know what o’clock it is ? ”
7400	7413	7415	7415	she	26	“ Why did you allow me to forget time in this way ? ”
7417	7425	7427	7427	Leslie	24	“ Was I likely to remind you ? ”
7429	7447	7427	7427	Leslie	24	“ But at all events I will repair my error , at whatever sacrifice . I will force myself”—“from
7450	7471	7427	7427	Leslie	24	” he thought of saying , but that was rather too strong an expression to come easily , so he began again—“I
7559	7939	7548	7548	I	0	” He was on his feet as he said this , and Laura , heated and wearied , could do nothing but agree ; he looked back as he plunged into the thicket , and waving his hand , saw , and smiled to see , that she was waiting for some such token , and then sank upon the bench almost as weary as Elinor had been . It was very easy for him to force his way along the brook , over great stones , and among tangled creepers and underwood ; and indeed , his desire to reach the place where he had left Elinor , made these obstacles almost unperceived , and brought him , in a very short time , straight to the root‐house in which they had parted from her . He hoped she would be panting with alarm , and crouching almost weeping for the want of some one to reassure her ; certainly she would not have ventured back alone . Could he see her white dress ? not yet , trees were in the way ; he could not see it — she was not there — yes , yes , quite in the corner , there was some one . Now , how gently he would he comfort her , and she would cling to his arm . But there was no such scene in store for him . Elinor , as though confiding in the assurance of safety she had received , had laid her cheek upon her arm and had fallen asleep . The shadow of the root‐house had probably fostered the inclination of her eyes to close ; her lips were parted , her hair pushed off her face , her colour heightened by the heat ; she lay or reclined there , at rest , and Leslie paused suddenly as he perceived her sleeping figure . But the presence of a human being , the involuntary motions of life near her broke her slumber ; she opened her eyes , and the habitual associations of her education , caused her a burst of alarm as she perceived who was so close to her . She sprang up and a step or two away from him . “
7947	7968	7548	7548	I	0	” she cried , involuntarily ; then she collected her senses , and a deep blush spread over her face . “
7977	7996	7997	7997	I	0	” cried Leslie , fervently ; but approaching no nearer than where he stood when she sprang up . “
8000	8008	8009	8009	I	0	” he added , after a pause , “
8033	8034	8026	8026	I	0	” “
8039	8043	8044	8044	she	29	” said Elinor , “
8061	8062	8044	8044	she	29	” “
8070	8074	8075	8075	I	0	” said Leslie . “
8102	8103	8096	8096	she	29	” “
8116	8125	8096	8096	she	29	” said Elinor , coming a step nearer . “
8142	8155	8096	8096	she	29	” said Leslie , trying to wear an air of proud humiliation . “
8178	8193	8171	8171	I	0	” So you had , innocent Elinor , but he cared not for that . “
8204	8208	8195	8195	you	0	” said Leslie , “
8213	8214	8195	8195	you	0	” “
8221	8225	8195	8195	you	0	” said Elinor ; “
8234	8235	8232	8232	anybody	262	” “
8241	8245	8238	8238	you	0	” said Leslie ; “

8282	8286	8274	8274	you	0	” said Elinor ; “
8313	8314	8311	8311	me	0	” “
8319	8346	8311	8311	me	0	” said Leslie , holding out his hand . She looked him steadily in the face for a few seconds , and then took his hand . “
8357	8361	8384	8384	she	264	” said Leslie ; “
8376	8377	8384	8384	she	264	” “
8407	8408	8387	8387	She	264	” “

8484	8485	8471	8471	I	0	” “
8488	8492	8471	8471	I	0	” said Leslie ; “
8500	8501	8505	8505	you	0	” “
8508	8523	8524	8524	You	0	” said Elinor . She took up her parasol and they walked leisurely along . “
8527	8532	8524	8524	You	0	” said her companion , “
8548	8549	8524	8524	You	0	” “
8552	8556	8524	8524	You	0	” said Elinor . “

8629	8630	8631	8631	I	0	” “
8647	8651	8638	8638	I	0	” said Leslie ; “
8671	8834	8662	8662	you	0	” Elinor assented , eagerly , wishing to atone for having been tired once to‐day . Leslie went off the path , and she followed , till the bank became steep and very inconvenient . Then he held out his hand and she leaned upon it as if it had been a helping stick ; she wanted it again , up a few steep stones in the bank , and when she was at the top of those she came upon a sight which made her pluck away her hand altogether to fold both in speechless delight . The brook just in front of her came down under rocks which nearly met above it , and leaped about twenty feet from the edge of its bed to the pool below . The white foam , the graceful motion and shape , the sweet confusing sound , the freshness , took her very soul by surprise , and she was melted to tears . “
8845	8849	8837	8837	I	0	” said Leslie ; “
8858	8859	8853	8853	I	0	” “
8871	8875	8876	8876	I	0	” said Elinor . “
8907	8914	8886	8886	he	36	” Leslie did not say aloud , “
8918	8931	8915	8916	Abject fool	284	” he said it only to himself ; to Elinor he said , “
8954	8955	8948	8948	he	36	” “
8961	8968	8958	8958	you	0	” . said Elinor , aghast . “
8977	8978	8958	8958	you	0	” “
8981	8985	8958	8958	you	0	” said Leslie , “

9015	9016	8958	8958	you	0	” “
9028	9029	8958	8958	you	0	” “

9151	9152	9154	9155	St. Francis	36	” “
9159	9163	9154	9155	St. Francis	36	” said Elinor . “
9218	9219	9220	9220	You	0	” “
9232	9233	9220	9220	You	0	” “
9250	9251	9220	9220	You	0	” “
9256	9314	9220	9220	You	0	” said Elinor , reflecting on the many things , the late rising , the neglected task , the idle play , the lingering over her toilette , which were pleasant but which she had been told were wrong , and warned against the pleasure of them . Leslie enjoyed the confusion into which she was running . “
9323	9536	9220	9220	You	0	” said he , with a candid tone . Elinor was silent ; he was no longer in haste to proceed , he lingered with her , teaching her that pleasure was her lawful guide ; and when , at last , they went forward , moved as slowly as she was inclined to move and wore away the time , so that when they got back to the house , Laura had , long before , been compelled to give up waiting for them ; had gone in alone , had been forced to preside over luncheon and to eat with the rest , or affect to eat , and after delaying to the utmost , had been driven from all excuses , and forced to bid the servants bring round , the carriage , previously ordered for an expedition . Just as she and her guests were going through the hall to set out , Mr. Leslie appeared alone coming up to the door . A sudden hope shot through Laura ’s heart that he had been alone since she left him . Elinor might have lost her way in the wood , but of course she would soon be found ; and with all this unworded she accosted him . “
9549	9550	9540	9540	you	290	” “
9584	9585	9574	9574	She	291	” “
9590	9596	9574	9574	She	291	” said Laura , disdainfully ; “
9609	9610	9597	9597	you	290	” “
9618	9639	9597	9597	you	290	” said Leslie , in a very low voice . Laura ’s lips relaxed by a line , no more . “
9646	9675	9597	9597	you	290	” said she , looking at the phaeton which followed the great barouche , and in which , if he liked , he might offer to drive her . “
9682	9686	9597	9597	you	290	” said Leslie , “
9736	10317	9730	9730	I	0	” Laura tossed her head , and turned away ; and Leslie was very glad to have got off this tax upon him . LAURA ’S anger and jealousy were almost more than she could bear . She learned to know that beating heart , that dry mouth , that distaste to food , that early waking and no more falling asleep , which make up the personal sufferings of mental anguish . She had to talk , to listen , to make music , while intensely preoccupied ; and she had the pain of perceiving that Leslie grew more and more indifferent to keeping up the appearances of devotion to herself , and became , like her , absorbed by one object , but that object was not Laura Chanson . Little incidents of this kind altered the position of the three persons whom we have presented to the reader . From a forlorn stranger , Elinor began to feel herself familiarised with persons and things , and to be aware that many were more favourable to her than the mistress of the house , whom she had looked upon as about to take the place of the Superior in her Convent . Leslie , who had thought of nothing but amusing himself for a month or so , gradually found himself interested in a pursuit , which , at present , had the charm of novelty in the object , besides its difficulty . He reflected as little on the suffering he might inflict on the person to whom he had hitherto devoted himself , as on those which in future he might leave with the defenceless girl whom he at present worshipped ; meantime , the suffering which Laura endured was very real , whether she were justified in having exposed herself to it or not . The young girl who had unconsciously taken her place was hateful to Laura ; it was difficult to keep up the appearance of interest and tender protection which had been their first relation to each other . She justified her altered feelings to herself by saying that severity was necessary to teach Elinor something of the ways of the world she had to move in , and to correct the mistakes into which her Convent life led her ; and , in fact , Elinor had great need of superintendence ; for with all her early impressions wrecking around her , she did not know to what to cling , or where to stop , or how go back . They had laughed at her prudery , and in the innocence of her nature she did not now know what difference to make between Leslie and Laura ; between Mr. Chanson , her elderly guardian , and Leslie , her young adorer . That Leslie was more good‐natured to her than anybody else she was certain , and if she wanted any advice or service , she supposed that she might as well ask him for either ; not to ask him would show that long‐taught horror of man which she haft just recently been made ashamed of . In this embarrassment of perception she , one morning , brought into the library a heavy packet , containing letters which she had written to her Convent ; and the first person from whom she made an inquiry how to effect its transmission , was Laura . But Laura was supercilious . “
10344	10534	10535	10535	It	297	” Elinor coloured and did as she was bid . But she was not satisfied , and after a short , silent bit of doubt , she looked round for some kinder listener , and turning her shy eyes to Mr. Leslie , saw that though he had a book in his hand , and his head was bent towards it , he was , in fact , looking at her . Elinor ’s colour rose again , for shame that she had been ashamed to appeal at once to him ; and avoiding the appearance of mistrust for which she had been laughed at , she smiled directly that she caught his glance , and went up to him as if he had been Sister Françoise or Sister Jeanne , and in a very low voice asked him what she should do . He was fully disposed to make it a serious affair , that he might be able to confer an obligation by arranging it , and rising , took it ( Elinor following him ) into the recess of the window and there examined the packet . “
10547	10551	10535	10535	It	297	” said he ; “
10563	10564	10565	10565	I	0	” “
10579	10583	10565	10565	I	0	” said Elinor . “
10593	10597	10565	10565	I	0	” said Leslie . “
10618	10619	10616	10616	ourselves	299	” “
10634	10638	10622	10622	I	0	” said Elinor . “
10653	10657	10661	10661	her	29	” suggested Leslie . “
10663	10664	10659	10659	I	0	” “
10667	10697	10659	10659	I	0	” and he watched her timid advance to Laura , whom she instinctively began to feel was not likely to look very benignantly on a request of her ’s . “
10705	10774	10659	10659	I	0	” he heard Laura say , and he concluded that she had heard the words which he himself had used . Laura said nothing more , for or against , and went on reading her book , the pages of which she turned tempestuously . Elinor said nothing , but again looked to Leslie , who , by a gesture , invited her to return to the window . “
10781	10785	10776	10776	you	303	” said he , “
10837	10838	10884	10884	you	303	” “
10842	10846	10884	10884	you	303	” said Elinor . “
10879	10880	10884	10884	you	303	” “
10886	10890	10884	10884	you	303	” said Elinor ; “
10916	10917	10907	10907	I	0	” “
10923	10935	10907	10907	I	0	” said Leslie ; then moderating his tone , he added , “
10954	10955	10942	10942	I	0	” “
10961	10967	10942	10942	I	0	” said the literal Elinor . “
10975	11017	10942	10942	I	0	” and she took out her purse . Leslie ’s heart smote him he saw that slender purse so slenderly provided . It was too much in keeping with the defenceless state and nature of that fair piece of human porcelain . “
11031	11032	11023	11023	I	0	” “
11039	11045	11046	11048	The Reverend Mother	34	” said Elinor , earnestly . “
11059	11060	11046	11048	The Reverend Mother	34	” “
11066	11132	11046	11048	The Reverend Mother	34	” said Leslie , finishing the phrase she broke off , and smiling . Elinor again was ashamed of a good lesson . She did not know what guidance to follow ; plainly she felt herself laughed at , and that was painful . She slid back her purse into the pocket of her apron , and stood again like a puzzled , penitent child . “
11140	11144	11046	11048	The Reverend Mother	34	” said Leslie , “
11151	11201	11202	11202	I	0	” He took it , and moving away to Mr. Chanson ’s room , which opened from the library , asked him if he could have a horse , and then returning , told Laura he was going to Cantleton and inquired if he could do anything for her . “
11205	11212	11202	11202	I	0	” said Laura , smiling painfully , “
11223	11224	11202	11202	I	0	” “
11245	11246	11202	11202	I	0	” “
11249	11253	11202	11202	I	0	” said Laura , “
11274	11279	11257	11257	One	1228	” Leslie gave a deprecating “
11284	11288	11257	11257	One	1228	” and added , “
11309	11321	11325	11325	purely	312	” Laura laughed scornfully , she could not repress her irritation . “
11327	11372	11373	11373	He	313	” said she , interrogating . Elinor heard all this and was very much grieved that his good‐nature to her should bring this reproach upon him . She knew it was wrong to let another suffer in one ’s place and spoke bravely out . “
11388	11453	11378	11378	he	313	” Leslie himself coloured at this sudden shifting of the ground under his feet , and Laura burst into that insolent laugh which bows down all but such as can laugh insolently in return . The moisture which precedes tears came into Elinor ’s eyes . She turned partly away , and Leslie could not but gaze on the innocent pretty picture she made . “
11464	11468	11469	11469	I	0	” said Laura . “
11491	11492	11487	11490	a new character ......	316	” “
11496	11505	11487	11490	a new character ......	316	” said Leslie , after a silent pause . “
11527	11528	11522	11522	your	313	” “
11560	11561	11551	11551	I	0	” “
11576	11589	11590	11591	Poor Elinor	21	” said Laura , abruptly ; and he saw her lip tremble . “
11593	11600	11590	11591	Poor Elinor	21	” thought he , looking back , “
11614	11669	11603	11603	you	21	” And a scolding it was , indeed . Not that Laura intended it when she began , but she lost her self‐command as she talked ; and the anguish which she endured , through Elinor , made her blind to the innocence , and deaf to the guileless purity of the young girl . “
11677	11681	11675	11675	Elinor	21	” she began , “
11716	11717	11707	11707	I	0	” “
11729	11730	11722	11723	Miss Chanson	29	” “
11753	11761	11722	11723	Miss Chanson	29	” said Laura , beginning to tremble . “
11771	11772	11765	11765	your	21	” “
11779	11780	11765	11765	your	21	” “
11853	11854	11855	11855	I	0	” “
11868	11869	11861	11861	I	0	” “
11977	11978	11967	11967	I	0	” “
11993	11999	12000	12000	Me	0	” said Elinor , weeping . “
12052	12440	12024	12024	I	0	” So saying , Laura fled from the room , for she could contain herself no longer ; and while Elinor wept silently in the library , Laura sobbed aloud in her boudoir , the door of which she had banged behind her and fastened with a double turn of the key . Elinor had a guiltless conscience in her favour , and recovered first ; but she was very unhappy , and being ignorant as to what she had done wrong she resolved first to beg Mr. Leslie ’s pardon , and then to entreat his assistance in explaining to her the course of conduct which would be doing right . She stole up the back staircase to her room ; bathed her face as she had often done in the pupils ’ room in the Convent , when she had been scolded and wanted to avoid the imputation of resenting the scolding ; and putting on her bonnet and gray cloak , went dejectedly down again , and glided by the most sequestered ways she could find , towards the gate of the park by which she believed Mr. Leslie would return . Here she sat down , patiently to wait for him , and screened herself from observation by choosing her seat among some drooping elms , whose long branches , as one sees sometimes with the elm tree , had turned downwards soon after leaving the stem , and bowed themselves to the ground , as if kneeling . But , patient as she was , and used to waiting , the length of time she remained there , during which there was nothing coming , made her first uneasy , and at last anxious . She got up and walked into the road , whence she could command a long sight of the highway beyond the gates , and still , when all was blank , returned to her seat , and resumed the paper‐mark she was plaiting in the shape of a cross . The woman who kept the lodge had seen this manœuvre more than once , and at last , in the civility of her heart , came out as Elinor again looked down the road , and asked if she was pleased to be waiting for some body . “
12443	12447	12024	12024	I	0	” said Elinor ; “
12460	12516	12451	12452	Mr. Leslie	24	” and as she said his name , she blushed deeply as young girls will do , at sight or at speaking of a young acquaintance of the opposite sex , though as heart‐whole as a bird just fledged , on the edge of its nest . The old woman laughed in a motherly way . “
12523	12527	12451	12452	Mr. Leslie	24	” said she . “
12543	12910	12535	12535	you	331	” and she withdrew to her cottage , and Elinor to her tree , puzzled again , and but half liking what she did not understand in the old woman . It was an hour and a half after she had come to the spot , when she heard the trot of horses ’ feet , at which her heart gave a bound , but directly the sound of wheels became audible , and the next bound of her heart was what might be called in the opposite direction . She went further under the trees , and saw Laura and others on horseback , and a carriage following , all making towards the Lodge at a good , exhilarating pace . As they approached it , she perceived Mr. Leslie coming in the opposite direction , and both parties stopped and had some communion together . What they said she did not know , but she perceived some laughter , some gestures of expostulation , and that Laura , after great apparent earnestness , suddenly jerked away her horse , and set off at an actual gallop ; while Mr. Leslie , who she supposed had refused their invitation to join them , waved his hand to them , and came alone , and slowly , along the road in the park . Without the least hesitation . or embarrassment , Elinor came forward from the trees , and caught his sight , making a motion inviting him to speak to her . He immediately rode up to the place where she stood , and dismounting , eagerly told her what he really had done , and a great deal more which he claimed to have done for her . Elinor was more and more troubled , and as soon as he would hear her , professed her regret at having thus employed him , in so penitent a manner , that the tears again rose to her eyes , and in his heart arose a tender pity , which made him ready to fall down at her feet , and raise her by his humble love above all claim and all necessity for pity . “
13002	13003	13033	13033	she	29	” “
13030	13031	13033	13033	she	29	” “
13060	13061	13043	13043	she	29	” “
13083	13084	13068	13068	she	29	” “
13089	13093	13094	13094	she	29	” said Leslie , “
13110	13111	13112	13112	You	332	” “
13124	13125	13117	13117	you	332	” “
13145	13538	13128	13128	I	0	” said Leslie , taking her hand , and gently leading her further into the wood . They walked on together side by side , deeply engaged in conversation , in which Elinor ’s defencelessness touched Leslie ’s heart with more of good emotion than he had known could dwell there . Yet he enjoyed involving her in a situation which depended upon himself to make it safe or dangerous , and which , at all events , was one in which she compromised herself with the prudent , and those who had more habit of the world than she . He perceived her perfect innocence of every such notion , and was every moment renewing a compact with himself to hold her in reverence . Yet he secured her hand on his arm — he could not keep himself from touching the fingers that lay there , from gently pressing the arm which touched his own . A trifling circumstance did more to check him than all his good resolutions . This was his horse , whose bridle he held , and whose uneven pace had constantly to be regulated ; sometimes it would start forward , and annoy its master with a threatened invasion of his toes ; sometimes stop to snatch at a bough , and when jerked on again , would shake its head , and flourish in the air in a manner dangerous to its safe keeping by the bridle . Elinor ’s attention was diverted from her own griefs , and Leslie ’s sympathy , by the manœuvres of the horse . With the tears in her eyes , she was provoked to laughter at its perversity ; and when most grateful for Leslie ’s assurance of friendship and support , could not help turning their talk to the horse ’s entertaining movements . Leslie hated the animal ; and , at last , to keep the conversation in the train which pleased him , he invited Elinor to sit down beneath a tree far and deep in the wood ; where , having fastened his tiresome animal to one at a distance , he returned and placed himself by her , distant from all the eyes that should have been guarding her , and undefended by any inward consciousness of being where she needed defence . “
13544	13548	13551	13551	I	0	” he said , “
13570	13571	13555	13555	you	336	” “
13576	13580	13555	13555	you	336	” said Elinor ; “
13614	13615	13594	13594	you	336	” “
13622	13644	13618	13618	you	336	” said Leslie — and there he hesitated , whether indeed to ask her to enter into secret correspondence with him . “
13659	13663	13652	13652	you	336	” said Elinor . “
13667	13759	13664	13665	Divine Elinor	42	” cried Leslie , carried away with delicious surprise ; and suddenly lifting the hand he held to his lips , he kissed it fervidly , so that in astonishment she drew it away , and a smile came for an instant over her mouth . Leslie looked down at her with delight ; he drew still nearer to her , when the sound of rustling boughs smote his ear , and then the voice of the Squire — of Mr. Chanson , of Elinor ’s guardian — broke upon them . “
13773	13790	13764	13764	You	336	here?”—he was not a man of words . Leslie started up ; Elinor kept her seat . “
13829	13926	13810	13810	I	0	” Elinor listened with wonder . She thought certainly Leslie had forgotten that she had come to meet him near the lodge , and that they had spent an hour in walking to the spot together , without any reference to going home ; however , she heard him as children hear their elders say things they have themselves been taught not to say , and unconsciously they take a lesson in the difference between learning and practising . Mr. Chanson asked no more ; he only held out his arm to her , and said , “
13940	13960	13932	13932	Laura	26	” He had a fishing‐rod in the other hand , and had been making his way to the brook . “
13967	13971	13961	13962	Miss Chanson	29	” said Elinor . “
13988	14028	13932	13932	Laura	26	” Elinor hesitated ; she did not like to say she had been scolded , and had crept away . Mr. Chanson thought she had made an appointment with Leslie , and that her embarrassment came from that consciousness . “
14033	14037	13932	13932	Laura	26	” said he . “
14077	14115	14063	14063	I	0	” And he walked forward , Elinor very willing to go with him , but looking back to see how Leslie got up to the horse , which was drawing away , and shying at his approach . “
14120	14125	14063	14063	I	0	” said the Squire ; “
14142	14207	14136	14136	I	0	” LESLIE had become aware that his presence had become unacceptable to the mistress of the house , or rather that his behaviour made it so , and therefore that it was time he should go . Her evident pique , which he had understood from Elinor ’s report of her conversation with Laura , had confirmed this resolution , and he had determined to “
14213	14376	14377	14377	I	0	” which required his presence elsewhere , even before the Squire looked so grim at him for being alone with Elinor in the wood . At dinner , therefore , he avoided sitting by Elinor , made himself as agreeable to Laura as her anger would allow , and before the ladies withdrew , told her he must leave Chan‐ son Wood next morning . Laura believed not one word of the story of the letters . She had heard her brother ’s report , and when he upbraided her with neglect of her charge , had given him to understand that the young girl chose to manage her own concerns , and was amenable neither to reproof nor persuasion . The Squire had guilelessly believed her , inclined the more to do so by what he had himself remarked ; and Laura , strong in the impression she had then made , had courage to attempt the same thing with Leslie . “
14381	14408	14377	14377	I	0	” said she , with a voice in which it was easy to perceive emotion , for his departure touched the sorest place in her heart , “
14422	14423	14414	14414	you	348	” “
14449	14450	14377	14377	I	0	” “
14455	14463	14471	14471	your	348	” said Laura , smiling sadly enough . “
14474	14475	14471	14471	your	348	” “
14483	14492	14471	14471	your	348	” said Leslie , abruptly , and colouring . “
14503	14507	14496	14496	you	348	” said Laura . “
14519	14520	14509	14509	I	0	” “
14526	14537	14521	14521	I	0	” said Leslie , mounting higher on his high horse . “
14544	14548	14538	14538	I	0	” said Laura ; “
14565	14566	14567	14567	You	0	” “
14572	14576	14567	14567	You	0	” said Leslie . “
14594	14595	14592	14592	you	0	” “
14600	14612	14618	14618	your	348	” said Laura , suddenly , and thrown off her guard ; “
14634	14635	14630	14630	you	348	” “
14640	14645	14630	14630	you	348	” said Leslie ’ ; “
14704	14747	14748	14748	I	0	” Laura looked at him steadily for a few seconds , and then changing her manner suddenly , uttered her scornful laugh , which made the blood tingle in his face as though he had been detected in the most egregious simplicity . “
14756	14760	14752	14752	I	0	” said he . “
14781	14782	14776	14776	I	0	” “
14790	14794	14776	14776	I	0	” said Laura . “
14797	14798	14776	14776	I	0	” “
14808	14831	14799	14799	I	0	” and slightly shrugging her shoulders , she escaped . When he took leave of the Squire it was the same thing . “
14840	14845	14832	14832	You	0	” said Mr. Chanson . “
14854	14855	14847	14847	you	0	” “
14867	14868	14886	14886	you	0	” “
14916	16464	14903	14903	She	363	” Leslie was vexed at the Squire ’s caution . Laura ’s would have been nothing , had not her brother ’s confirmed it . There must be some‐ thing , as both had made a similar observation . Yet , when he met Elinor before breakfast next morning , walking in the garden , and she told him that she had hoped to see him there , and it was therefore she had come , he forgot to ask himself if such child‐like simplicity could be feigned , and renewed all those vows of friendship and support which Elinor needed ; and vowswarmer than which he felt instinctively would not be understood . His intention was to leave her for a time , since his hostess took his desertion so much amiss , but if his own heart preserved the impression Elinor had made upon it , he had resolved to see her again at any cost , and then to let the course of events determine their future relations . Accordingly he betook himself home , where he had occupation and amusement awaiting him , and where the novelty of being master gave him interests which made it the place most frequently in his thoughts when absent . It was an ancient house , which seemed , from the remains of building about it , to have been once a portion of a much larger resi‐ dence . It stood in a valley , upon an isolated hill , on the slopes of which the various ruined walls , covered for the most part with the vegetation of years , and crowned with mountain ash and birch , offered many a romantic seat , and many a sheltered bit of terrace for whole natural beds of wild flowers . The house was out of order , but not ruinous , and offered scope to the eye and fancy of the proprietor as to its restoration to a beautiful and convenient dwelling . From it one looked down the valley to the church , with its spire rising above the cottages and orchards of a village , and on the stream which wound its way through wood and meadow , wandering on towards hills , for ever varying in light and shade , and as it had a western aspect , offering every evening the gorgeous spectacle of sunset . All this valley belonged to Leslie , and so did the neighbouring lands , for about 3,000 acres in all , of poor but lovely country . He had a neighbour , richer than himself , and with a grander place , to the east of his valley ; and a few other scattered houses , together with a market town about six miles on , over the common and heathy grounds , made up his neighbourhood . There was plenty of game on Leslie ’s estate , and one plan for this autumn was to amuse himself with its pursuit ; but though he was as active as might reasonably be guessed from his admirable frame , he had never got up to any enthusiasm for hunting or shooting . He tried the latter the first morning after his return , but though the partridges were plentiful , and his success considerable , he thought it a more stupid occupation than ever , to‐day . While he was walking over the dry stubbles , what was Elinor doing ? Was she reading one of those little dreamy books which he had commented upon many a time , till an unwilling smile broke over her lips , and she turned away her face that he might not see it ? or was she suffering from Laura ’s bad temper , with that pretty mournful expression in her eyes and on her mouth , which made her look even younger than her own fresh youth ? Was she sitting , cool and pale , on the fallen oak in the wood , while he was toiling , hot and red , in company with his gamekeeper , watching a dog beguiling a bird ? He went home very early , and then walked about his own place , cutting away boughs which shut out the lovely view , and projecting how to convert into an entrance a hexagon room supported by a central pillar , which was said once to have been a chapel . But he was constantly leaning the hatchet idle against a tree , or drawing scrolls and scrawls on the margin of the paper where he was making his plans — his thoughts being elsewhere , at the side of Elinor , thinking over something said or done by her , and what he had said , or had better have said or done , in return . Two or three days made his home intolerable — intolerable , at least , to a man so free to go whithersoever his wishes directed him — and getting up one morning at dawn , from a bed where he could not sleep , he put up a portmanteau before his servant was awake , and by the time the labourers came to their work , was driving to the little neighbouring town where the coach changed horses at seven o’clock . Nobody asked , and nobody knew where he was going : he went quite alone , and by one change of vehicle and another reached the neighbourhood of Chanson Wood by nightfall . He would not on any account have been recognised ; he was ashamed of returning so soon , and took the most genuine precautions to remain in obscurity . He engaged a room a couple of miles from the park , at a little public house where , having never entered it during his visit to the Squire , he was unknown ; and pretending something about an engagement to survey the country , and displaying some paper and pencils , felt himself safe from inquiry . The intense desire to see Elinor again , however , would not let him rest in the house , and as soon as the night was quite dark , he took his way along the lane , and through the wicket beside the carriage entrance , and then by cautious approaches to that side of the house where was the room the family occupied in the evening . All was carelessly secure , as in a great country house in the midst of its gardens , and inhabited by its multitude ; and he had but to push open the low iron gate in the fence between the garden and the park , to find himself upon the walk which led up beneath the windows . There was a flower border , and then a green sward , between the house and the gravel walk , so that Leslie , by walking on the turf , and then on the silent mould of the border , got noiselessly up to an open sash , and could look in and command the whole room . All was silent inside . There were three persons , and one was Elinor . She was sitting beside a lamp , with her face to the window , but it was leant over a piece of work which she held in her hands . There was nothing but white of different shades about her ; her muslin gown was white , a white satin bow fastened it at her throat , a white lace border , or collar , lay flat on her low shoulders , the work in her hands was white cambric , which she was embroidering ; her pale face and fair hands were touched by the lamplight , and her motionless figure seemed patient of a dull employment and ungenial companions . Laura reclined in a chair , partly turned from the window , reading ; and the Squire was fast asleep on a sofa , breaking the silence by regular snoring , loud enough to increase Leslie ’s chance of escaping detection . He saw her then , he could speak to her with silently moving lips , he could appeal to her with passionate eyes and entreating hands , he could bend his knee towards the ground , adoring her beauty , or rather her loveableness . Perhaps he a little over‐wrought these gesticulations , for while most wrapped in them , a little dog , which was lying with its back well into Laura ’s silk gown , jumped up , and gave a sharp volley of barks . Elinor looked suddenly up , but Leslie was gone into the shadow . The Squire did not cease his sonorous aspirations , and Laura was too much used to her Spitz ’s hysterical alarms to move so much as her head . But Leslie felt his security gone ; and that probably the little Spitz ’s eyes were even then on the window , beaming with the purpose of another frantic yap upon the smallest sign from outside . He withdrew very cautiously , but his soul was bitter against the Spitz . “
16484	17195	16479	16479	you	364	” murmured he , as he retreated . The necessity of his soul was to see Elinor again ; he wished to be the unseen spectator of what she was and did , to make sure that a creature so innocent really existed , and to enjoy the spectacle if it was true . To enjoy it and destroy it ; for he looked no further than to present gratification of the passion which filled his breast — all his remoter thoughts were of ambition and success in the tempestuous world , which seemed another sphere from that he occupied at present . He put on , next day , the dress of a workman , and as deeply slouched a hat as he could suppose consistent with the character . He provided himself with an axe , and hoped to pass unrecognised , if he could avoid direct communication with his former host and fellow guests ; and taking his way into the woods about the house , went first to the brook , where he had shown Elinor the waterfall , and where he knew she had occasionally resorted after that time . His expectations were more than fulfilled , for he had no pains of waiting to go through , no fears , no doubtful hopes ; a figure was standing on the very spot whither he had led Elinor , and though the face was turned away , the elegant shape was that which he longed to see . The falling water prevented his step from being heard , and he was able to take up a place among the trees , where he could observe her , yet run scarce any danger of detection . Should she perceive him , he would deal a few strokes at the trees , and trust to be taken for the forester , and pass unnoticed . The unconscious Elinor made her preparations for passing the burning hours in shade and a refreshing atmosphere . She laid aside her bonnet , put by her gloves , unfastened the cotton gown from her throat , and it charmed him to see she did not open a book , but unfolded a piece of household work , and industriously shaped , and hemmed , and sewed at the white jacket she was making . Sometimes she paused , and looked long at the lovely fall of waters , and once going down to the edge of the brook , took water in her joined hands , and drank from that pretty cup . Then returning , she resumed her work , and gave no sign of thoughts within , except a few times singing some notes , like a bird alone in the sun , trying a passage taught by the impulse of its melodious throat . It was a fair picture of still life , and he looked at it with the passion of a lover , and the eye of an artist ; but at last he began to grow discontented that there was no sign of wanting or thinking of him , no looks cast upwards , no sighs , no restless movement , which he might have interpreted into regret that he was not there . Should he suddenly appear , would he be welcome even ? Yes , welcome , perhaps , as a novelty , not as the thing desired — welcome to come and go , but if she knew he had come all that way merely to look at her , she would laugh . He was a very young man , and little knew the patience of a modest maiden , nor the absence of all spoken words , and speaking signs , when she is with herself alone , and is occupied with her natural duties and works . He watched her all that morning , and saw her at last fold her work , rise and gather some beech leaves while she stood under the tree , to wind one into the other , till they made a wreath , then hanging it on her wrist , she took up her wicker basket , and shortly withdrew towards the house . “
17200	17217	17198	17198	Lar	46	” said he , coming and standing exactly in front of the seat she had occupied , “
17381	17901	17375	17375	you	46	” Next day , he came again , and saw her again . It was , as the village bells told him , a Saint ’s day , and Elinor , whom no one helped to perform her usual devotions in an appointed place , came into the entangled woods to find a temple . He saw her kneel in front of the great tree , and with humble eyes cast upon the ground , sign the cross upon her bosom , and open her little book of prayer . Even in these devotions there was something which suited his feeling about Elinor better than if the prayer had been more untaught , more her own creation . She passively did what she had been taught to do — she murmured over a form of words , continually coming to the same repetition , and making the same sign of devotion . She turned her pages to the places where marks in the book showed she ought to go , and though the service lasted long , showed no wish either to shorten or prolong it , but did what was set down for her , and then rose and had done . Again she took her seat upon the fallen tree , again unfolded her work , and again , with the shadows of boughs and leaves moving over her as the breath of air gently swayed them , sat plying her household needle . What thoughts broke in upon the even train which was necessary to guide that needle , he would fain have guessed . Surely some thoughts must accompany the motion of those active fingers — perhaps there were many given to convent days ; perhaps some to him — he wished it , but hardly hoped it ; but at last , without the sewing being interrupted , he heard well known notes begin to murmur from her throat , and go on to a continued but still low song , which made him believe those tranquil thoughts had indeed been recalling him , and had come to the point which made that song and him one common subject , for it was the air of a duett in which he had attempted to join her , an air sung at village weddings in Brittany , and he had never seen her laugh so cordially as at his failures in trying to keep a second . Now he heard the village notes and verses again , and believed his own image was before her . She broke off before the verse was finished , and he saw her look from her work , and though he could not hear it , was certain she laughed — briefly , as one does alone . Then there was some measuring or adapting in the work , which took up her attention , and obliged her to rise and use the fallen tree for a table , and when all was in order , she again sat down to work , and seemed to have forgotten all about “
17905	18033	18036	18036	he	367	” Probably they were the words in the song which were the very last she thought about . The intense pleasure of watching , and appropriating her solitary ways and movements , had gone on long past mid‐day , when Leslie heard a step coming along the rough track which led from the wood walk to this unfrequented place . It was only a servant , who , approaching Elinor , delivered some message and went away again ; and she , in consequence it seemed , collected the materials of her employment , and left her seat probably to obey a summons to the house . Leslie was vexed , first at losing his amusement , and next at the way in which it was lost . “
18044	18049	18036	18036	he	367	” said he , to himself—“one
18081	19000	18060	18062	the very servants	370	society”—puppy himself , though of a stout , handsome breed . However , there was no probability of her return , he thought , and after half an hour ’s waiting for the chance of it , he had moved away , and was descending towards the brook , when he perceived a motion in the boughs overhanging the path , and stopping to watch , perceived it was Elinor coming again , and in haste , to the accustomed spot . Leslie was in front of her , and accident gave him a better place to see her than he had ventured to choose for himself ; his fear was that she should also perceive him , but she evidently was in a mood so preoccupied as not readily to have her attention caught by outer objects . All her humble tranquillity was gone . As soon as she reached her fallen tree , she sank down upon it , and leaning both hands upon one of the projecting branches , hid her face , and wept bitterly . She lifted her head more than once , to wipe her streaming eyes , and then hid them again , as though the lovely scene were blotted and rendered null by the grief within . Presently she rose , and went hastily down to the brook , and there kneeling and stooping over it , dashed the water repeatedly over her face , and let her hair come dripping from the stream . She then sat down on a rock close to the margin , and not five yards from Leslie , but , as it chanced , with her back to him , and bringing from a little basket a case containing paper and a pen , she put her lithe figure into such a position as to find a desk on part of the rock where she sat , and began hastily to write . Leslie ’s heart beat faster than ever . Had she not asked him for his direction , that she might apply to him if ever she was in trouble ? Was she writing to him ? To whom else was it probable , that in that sudden grief , whatever it might be , she should be writing ? and he so near — he could almost see the lines as she traced them . Did she summon him to her ? What would she say if he were suddenly at her side?—but then he should lose all the gratitude due to obeying her call — he should be the inferior who had come to seek , instead of the superior who had been besought to come . No , he would not hazard that!—besides , he was not sure that she was writing to him ; it might be some one else to whom she was appealing . She had very suddenly made him her confidant — it was not impossible that there might be others equally favoured . What was it the Squire had said she was — whimmy?—he had called her whimmy . Yet , alas ! that she should cry so , and no one be near to comfort her . Would not she cling to him like a friend if she saw him ? would not she be gladder than she knew ? Yet , possibly , no!—he would not hazard it — but that letter he would get by some means , and it should not be long before it was his ; then he should know what to do . Meantime , Elinor finished the hastily‐written letter , folded it , and replacing the little matters in her basket , pushed the basket among the ferns and stones , and hastily took her way by a difficult path down the dingle . Leslie concluded that she was going to the post‐office to put in her letter ; and he purposed to follow soon after , and ask for it in his own name , in case it should be addressed to him . But then the letter would be directed to his own place , of which he had given Elinor the direction , and at the post‐office they would not dare give it except where it was addressed . Yet he knew the old woman who acted as post‐mistress , and she had been constantly in the habit of seeing him during his visit at Mr. Chanson ’s , and perhaps , if he resumed the clothes and character of Mr. Leslie , she might be prevailed upon to disregard the direction in favour of the bodily presence of the man directed to . He therefore rushed back to his lodgings to change his peasant ’s dress , and then , regardless of being discovered , regardless of everything except the possession of the letter , he turned back boldly to the post‐office . For the convenience of the great house , it was located at the park gates , in the lodge , and was kept by the same old woman who had taken notice of Elinor ’s watch for Mr. Leslie . She was perfectly familiar with his appearance , but when he went into the house and inquired if there was anything for him , she started as if she had no expectation nor wish to see him , and seemed to take the circumstance occurring as a personal injury . “

19462	19467	19456	19456	I	0	” said . Leslie , “
19486	19487	19478	19478	you	0	” “
19502	19514	19495	19495	you	0	” said the old woman . Leslie was provoked to smile . “Come
19518	19522	19523	19523	I	0	” said he , “
19575	19659	19571	19571	you	0	” The ancient post‐mistress laughed , and went to the box into which the letters were dropped . Leslie found out her fibs as fast as she composed them , and she acknowledged him a master spirit . A little rummaging and a little grumbling produced the letter in question , and Leslie seizing it , first of all before devouring the contents , carefully examined the folds and fastening , for he had conceived certain suspicions from the old lady ’s words . “
19665	19677	19571	19571	you	0	” said he , abruptly , after looking at it attentively . “
19682	19695	19696	19696	you	0	” said she , trying to lay her thumb on the fastening ; “
19706	19707	19696	19696	you	0	” “
19712	19744	19696	19696	you	0	” said Leslie , guarding it from her , for though he had only asked the question as a random shot , he now was certain that there was some mystery . “
19776	19794	19772	19772	I	0	” The old sharpshooter was chased from her defences , but ran and took up another position . “
19799	19803	19772	19772	I	0	” said she , “
19858	19859	19863	19864	Miss Chanson	29	” “
19875	19876	19870	19870	her	29	” “
19891	19892	19895	19895	you	394	” “
19901	19905	19895	19895	you	394	” said Leslie . “
19935	19936	19939	19941	a wilful man	396	” “
19943	19950	19939	19941	a wilful man	396	” said the post‐mistress to herself , “
19965	20018	19954	19956	two silly girls	397	” Leslie meantime walked hastily away , and took a path over the fields to be out of observation , opening and reading the much canvassed letter as he went along . He could not but smile at the simplicity of the writer ’s alarms , and of her confidence in him . “
20022	20027	20029	20029	he	396	” that ’s Monsieur , “
20032	20133	20019	20019	Sir	372	” SIR — You are my only friend ; I do not know what to do unless you can help me — and you told me to ask you for help if I was in trouble . Have you money you can lend me ? I will pay you back , a little every quarter , and once you said it was not wrong to borrow from you . Miss Chanson called me , and gave me many bills , which I did not know of — perhaps they will put me in prison . What will become of me ? “
20137	20138	20134	20135	ELINOR LADYLIFT	21	” “
20146	20150	20134	20135	ELINOR LADYLIFT	21	” cried he ; “
20319	20347	20317	20317	her	402	” Accordingly he wrote in the soberest manner , making much , indeed , of her embarrassments , but promising to alleviate them ; and then informed her “
20405	20406	20407	20407	She	402	” “
20428	20438	20425	20426	Miss Ladylift	21	” said he , as he sealed his letter ; “
20464	20550	20551	20553	Mr. Davis tailior	50	” The next difficulty was to convey this letter to her , and it perplexed him till he saw the Squire and Laura ride past his lodging , and thus knew they were out of the way ; and then he resolved to go himself to the house , in the peasant ’s dress he had worn in the morning , and there to put his answer into the hands of a labouring clod in the gardens . This he did , begging him to take “
20567	20634	20551	20553	Mr. Davis tailior	50	” The obliging clod complied , and Leslie returned to his lodging , and early in the evening to the woods , expecting the guileless creature who put such confidence in him . Nor was he disappointed . About nine o’clock , of a warm , moonlit , September evening , Leslie standing anxiously in the wood‐path , saw Elinor coming along it to meet him . “
20640	20648	20637	20637	you	410	” she said , as they met ; “
20679	20680	20671	20671	I	0	” “
20687	20706	20682	20682	you	0	” said Leslie , taking her hand , which she withdrew when she had performed the proper greeting . “
20747	20748	20751	20752	Mr. Leslie	24	” “
20772	20773	20764	20764	you	24	” “
20784	20788	20789	20789	you	0	” said Leslie ; “
20812	20813	20814	20814	I	0	” “
20818	20822	20814	20814	I	0	” said Elinor ; “
20836	20837	20831	20831	I	0	” “
20856	20882	20852	20852	I	0	” said Leslie , drawing her gently to the fallen tree , where he had watched her sitting those autumn days , and placing himself beside her—“I
20943	20948	20956	20956	I	0	me”—he possessed himself of her hand—“and
20992	21010	21014	21014	you	0	” Elinor ’s hand stayed in his , but it was with the calmest voice she answered , “
21023	21024	21014	21014	you	0	” “
21053	21054	21030	21030	you	0	” “
21066	21090	21057	21057	I	0	” said Elinor , the slightest smile passing over her face , as at the suggestion of something wholly out of the question . “
21121	21122	21098	21098	you	0	” “
21125	21137	21098	21098	you	0	” said Elinor , with a mournful inflection in her voice . “
21179	21180	21171	21171	you	0	” “
21251	21265	21266	21266	Elinor	21	” Elinor was silent . She was listening , and trying to comprehend . “
21302	21303	21315	21320	Your kind Mother in the Convent	424	” “
21310	21314	21315	21320	Your kind Mother in the Convent	424	” said Elinor . “
21372	21373	21390	21390	he	430	” “
21376	21380	21381	21381	they	429	” said Elinor , “
21387	21388	21381	21381	they	429	” “
21450	21536	21543	21543	Elinor	21	” His right hand suddenly transferred her ’s to his left , and went round her waist , nor did it fail to press that slender , warm column , which it had encircled . Elinor did not withdraw , but she raised her clear eyes to his , and met his fierce glance with such inquiring , innocent calmness , that his arm released its hold , and he did but raise her hand to his mouth , and pressed one kiss upon it . “
21545	21546	21538	21538	I	0	” “
21553	21557	21550	21550	you	0	” said Elinor . “
21568	21758	21561	21561	you	21	” said Leslie , to himself , and he felt that he should but set her on her guard by any further revelation of his feelings ; but he was not wholly displeased with the step he had advanced . All recollection of the cause of their meeting had departed from him ; but while he was thinking how best to go on with the interview , Elinor took advantage of the pause , and returned to the difficulties he was to settle for her , which to him appeared prosaic and superfluous , but to her was the thing that made their meeting interesting . Leslie took from her hand the little neat bundle of papers which she produced ; he comprehended that Laura had not chosen to explain or soften anything , and promised that he would himself arrange all . He would then have passed to other subjects , but Elinor would stay no longer after she had fulfilled her errand , and then he fixed the next afternoon for another meeting at the same place , to give account of what he should have done . “
21765	21769	21561	21561	you	21	” said he ; “
21790	21883	21784	21784	you	433	” Elinor did so . She had no conscience but Leslie — her own had never come much into activity , and that which she brought from the Convent had been all overthrown . Elinor returned to the house , and to the saloon where Mr. Chanson and his sister Laura were sitting , and entering it with her light , noiseless movement , was taking up her work , and about to seat herself in her usual place , when Laura stopped her , by asking , in a constrained voice , “
21891	21892	21886	21886	you	434	” “
21897	21910	21886	21886	you	434	” said Elinor , the colour rising , she knew not why . “
21916	21921	21886	21886	you	434	” said the Squire , “
21947	21948	21951	21951	you	434	” “
21954	21996	21951	21951	you	434	” said Laura , briefly . Elinor had nothing to say ; the question was so home , that it admitted but of yes or no ; one of which she might not , and the other she would not say . “
22000	22005	21951	21951	you	434	” said Mr. Chanson ; “
22018	22019	22025	22025	I	0	” “
22030	22034	22025	22025	I	0	” said Elinor . “
22049	22054	22041	22041	I	0	” said Mr. Chanson . “
22077	22078	22067	22067	you	434	” “
22082	22098	22067	22067	you	434	” said Elinor . But Laura , speaking almost at the same time , said , “
22121	22196	22119	22119	somebody	376	” Elinor answered nothing , but bent her head over her sewing , and had the tears in her eyes . Mr. Chanson was almost as much embar‐ rassed as she . He rose up , crushed the newspaper , and turning his back , leaned on the mantel‐shelf , taking part in his own heat with the embarrassed young girl , against his sister , though the latter was clearly in the right . “
22202	22206	22199	22200	Mr. Leslie	24	” said Laura . “
22212	22221	22209	22210	Mr. Leslie	24	” said her brother , half turning round ; “
22225	22292	22295	22295	Elinor	21	” Laura could not be quite sure it was he , for though , indeed , the broken seal of Elinor ’s letter had revealed the intercourse between them , she could not comprehend by what means he could so rapidly have obeyed the summons ; yet she could not but feel it must be Leslie , and her anxiety and dread about it were extreme . “
22305	22306	22303	22303	he	24	” “
22311	22316	22303	22303	he	24	” said Mr. Chanson ; “
22350	22431	22295	22295	Elinor	21	” What there was besides he did not explain , but Elinor took courage under this unexpected defence , and though she would not say a word of denial herself , felt half justified by the denial he extemporised , and sewed away , supported in the silence she resolved to observe . Laura , on the other hand , was unduly discouraged , and her pressing investigation , which must have ended in a victory , resulted in an impatient “
22434	22555	22295	22295	Elinor	21	” and the three sat in the most uncomfortable silence , till Elinor , who felt thoroughly humble , and anxious to do something right , though she could not do the one right thing they wanted , so anxiously watched her chances of finding the Squire ’s spectacles , picking up his book , and placing it softly on the table when it fell out of his slumbering hand , of remembering where Laura had laid down the key of the tea‐chest , of letting Puff out of the room , and letting him in again , that Mr. Chanson ’s heart was quite softened , and gently touching her head , he said , in a low voice , “
22570	22910	22566	22566	Laura	26	” and Elinor was so pleased with the kind words , that she felt as if she should never obey anybody else , nor perhaps would she , had there been as much womanly kindness and sincerity in the sister as of gentleness in the brother . But Laura had feelings quite apart from the interests of Elinor , which prevented any approach to kindliness , and those were her own concern in Leslie , and in all that he did . He had secured a place in her affections such as he never aspired to , and which , at this time , he would much rather have been without ; and it made Laura wild with jealousy to think that one day Elinor might occupy the place which she herself , with all her beauty , wit , and wealth , longed for in vain . Should those two be coming and going together , civil to her , but lovers of each other ? should it be by short and transient fits that she should see Leslie , but Elinor be of his house , always his and with him ? should the stranger ’s sustained attention be for her , but the word , the sign , the look , the understood gesture , be for Elinor ? Laura could not endure it , and the thing was so inadmissible , that whatever she could do to prevent it seemed the thing to be done — not the right thing , perhaps , but still to be done . She hated Elinor , and would willingly have seen in her all those defects which would disenchant Leslie ; she wished they were in her , and acknowledged to be there by everybody ; and when Elinor had gently crept out of the room , at an early bedtime , she broke the long silence that had descended upon them all , and began to talk in an ingenuous , candid tone , to her brother . “
22923	22927	22566	22566	Laura	26	” said she . “
22959	22960	22981	22981	Laura	26	” “
22965	22970	22981	22981	Laura	26	” said the Squire ; “
22994	22995	22989	22989	She	444	” “
23010	23011	23001	23001	she	444	” “
23021	23022	23019	23019	she	444	” “
23152	23153	23154	23154	I	0	” “
23158	23163	23154	23154	I	0	” said the Squire ; “
23179	23180	23171	23171	Leslie	24	” “
23187	23193	23171	23171	Leslie	24	” cried Laura , anxiously ; “
23234	23235	23236	23236	She	444	” “
23242	23247	23236	23236	She	444	” answered the Squire . “
23252	23258	23260	23260	he	51	” went on Miss Chanson , “
23282	23283	23295	23295	Laura	26	” “
23308	23309	23310	23310	I	0	” “
23322	23331	23310	23310	I	0	” said Laura , turning away her head . “
23351	23352	23348	23348	I	0	” “
23427	23428	23441	23441	you	26	” “
23449	23450	23441	23441	you	26	” “
23455	23459	23441	23441	you	26	” said Laura ; “
23470	23471	23441	23441	you	26	” “
23517	23518	23496	23496	she	52	” “
23527	23529	23520	23520	she	52	” . “
23568	23569	23570	23570	Lawrence	51	” “
23580	23590	23570	23570	Lawrence	51	” and she laid her head on his shoulder . “
23596	23597	23570	23570	Lawrence	51	” “
23605	23613	23570	23570	Lawrence	51	” said he , fondly caressing her ; “
23629	23630	23635	23635	him	51	” “
23692	23720	23721	23721	I	0	” Thus talked brother and sister ; it was a pity that Laura knew all the time that she was lying . Those words of her own , “
23731	24152	23721	23721	I	0	” took herself in , for although they conveyed a great deal , they affirmed nothing . Elinor was perplexed beyond measure what to do about her next day ’s engagement . The utmost she wished was to tell Leslie that she could meet him no more ; but she knew not by what means to effect this . Laura would not let her go beyond her sight . The room , which she had declared herself so anxious should be common between them , was for the first time opened to Elinor ; she took a pretext of some fine lace , which was in bad condition , and which Elinor , profiting by a convent accomplishment , had once offered to put in order . She had then told how a certain veil had been wanted for an image of the Virgin , in a procession , and how it had been trusted to her to put to rights , when some others had refused through fear of its tenderness . She had spread it on a thick bed of cambric , and then , by patient immersions in certain prepared waters , had removed every trace of dirt and stain , without the least violence to the frail fabric , so that when the image appeared in it next day , inquiries had been made who could so successfully have renovated the delicate fabric . This had been a tale of the early days of her arrival , and she was surprised to‐day at Laura ’s recollection of it , and not best pleased that the occupation should have been given her just this morning . Then followed a drive in which Elinor was included , the object of which was to meet a young relation of the Chansons , Sir Peter Bicester , who had just got orders to join his regiment in Ceylon , and was coming for a farewell visit to Chanson Wood . He was a lively , thoughtless lad of eighteen , a great admirer of his cousin Laura , who was six years older than he , and in his intense attentions , during their after‐dinner saunter in the garden , Laura lost sight of Elinor , and Elinor , with the speed of an Italian greyhound , ran to the waterfall to say one word , and but one , to Leslie . In case of not finding him , she had provided herself with a little note , merely , “
24169	24265	24167	24167	LADYLIFT	21	” This she intended to lay on the fallen tree , and trusted it would be found by Leslie , should she not meet with him . Leslie had been there early — as early as he thought it possible the usual morning ride or drive of the others would set Elinor at liberty — and the longer she delayed , the stronger the fear became that he should not see her , so much the intenser grew his desire to do so , and the regard in which he held the object of it . “
24271	24275	24269	24269	Elinor	21	” thought he ; “
24305	24398	24399	24399	I	0	” and then more dreamily his thoughts dwelt upon images of virtuous felicity , upon the meanness of betraying such guileless confidence , and upon the difficulty which he had not hitherto counted upon of converting her quiet feeling into one of passion . It was already quite dusk , when his ear at last caught a footfall . It was of one running quickly ; and eagerly springing to meet her , he at last beheld Elinor , and felt an almost unknown pleasure in the reality that she was there . “
24407	24411	24399	24399	I	0	” said she . “
24433	24434	24423	24423	I	0	” “
24438	24447	24448	24448	He	37	” said Leslie , holding fast her hand . “
24469	24470	24454	24454	You	21	” “
24504	24505	24508	24509	kind friend	469	” “
24511	24544	24508	24509	kind friend	469	” said Elinor , receiving the little bundle of papers which he had prepared so as to look business‐like ( taking care that in fact they should trouble her no more ) , “
24581	24582	24578	24578	me	0	” “
24596	24600	24588	24588	I	0	” said he . “
24656	24657	24652	24652	you	21	” “
24661	24665	24652	24652	you	21	” cried Leslie ; “
24671	24732	24733	24733	Elinor	21	” and perceiving it closed in her hand , he gently took that hand , to draw the paper from when a violent start from Elinor made him , too , start , and looking where she looked , he saw Laura standing but a few yards from them . She came forward directly that she perceived she was observed . “
24735	24739	24733	24733	Elinor	21	” said she , “
24748	24749	24745	24745	your	21	” “
24755	24759	24750	24750	I	0	” said Elinor ; “
24773	24774	24762	24762	I	0	” “
24778	24818	24762	24762	I	0	” said Laura , in a low , trembling voice . Leslie did not mean to be scolded like a schoolboy ; he approached Elinor with the open , commonplace air of an acquaintance , and offering his hand , “
24827	24831	24824	24825	Miss Ladylift	21	” said he . “
24858	24859	24848	24848	you	21	” “
24865	24971	24863	24863	Elinor	21	” Miss Chanson repeated , and Elinor , puzzled , moved away and disappeared , letting fall , as she did so , the little twisted note , which by this time she had forgotten . Laura , meantime , made several efforts to speak , while Leslie politely waited , his eyes averted , and only listening indifferently for anything she might wish to say . But he was surprised and startled out of this indifference by a sudden outburst of tears from Laura , who , unable to withhold her emotion any longer , gave way , and wept like one most miserable . “
24975	24984	24863	24863	Elinor	21	” said he , coming up to her ; “
25009	25078	25005	25005	I	0	” Laura ’s tears flowed only the more profusely , and it was in vain she used her utmost effort to restrain the sobs which burst from her breast . She did , in fact , put her hand on his arm , but she turned away her head , and avoided , as much as she could , any support or assistance he would have given her . “
25121	25122	25126	25126	you	29	” “
25129	25162	25126	25126	you	29	” cried Leslie , feeling the awkwardness of his position , yet not displeased at its novelty , only quite resolved to commit himself in no manner , and to no thing . “
25177	25178	25179	25179	I	0	” “
25193	25199	25190	25191	your sister	474	” said she , suddenly . “
25241	25258	25261	25261	you	473	” Her voice broke off , and though she tried to go on she could not . “
25264	25296	25261	25261	you	473	” said Leslie , not at all choosing that Laura should force herself on him as a confidant , nor be able to say that he was the lover of Elinor . “
25335	25350	25333	25334	a sister	475	here”—and he tried to take her hand , which she very hastily snatched away — “
25370	25390	25333	25334	a sister	475	” Laura raised her large , fine eyes to his , with a look interpreted by him to mean , “
25399	25418	25333	25334	a sister	475	” and then suddenly put out her hand , which he took , and felt that it trembled . “
25425	25429	25333	25334	a sister	475	” said Laura , “
25454	25455	25447	25447	I	0	” “
25462	25466	25458	25458	I	0	” said Leslie ; “
25511	25521	25526	25526	you	473	” Laura sighed deeply , and shook her head . “
25556	25570	25571	25571	I	0	” she concluded , at last , in an eager , abrupt voice . “
25574	25586	25587	25587	I	0	” said Leslie — not knowing what to say he felt — “
25593	25594	25595	25595	I	0	” “
25603	25616	25617	25617	you	24	” said Laura , breaking off what he was saying very impatiently ; “
25630	25642	25617	25617	you	24	” she added , forcing a smile to her pale lips . “
25647	25684	25617	25617	you	24	” and she moved away ; but in all her violence of emotion , she had recollected the little twisted note , and had stooped and secured it , without attracting Leslie ’s attention to it . “
25690	25702	25617	25617	you	24	” thought Leslie , looking after her as she hastily disappeared . “
25790	26226	25786	25786	I	0	” LAURA had now entered on a desperate game , which she resolved at every hazard should end in making her the wife of Leslie . Right is so much the essential point in our actions , that scarce any villany is deliberately done without justifying it to ourselves ; and so Laura , when not abandoned to passion , found good reasons in the advantages to Leslie , and in her own superior powers of making him happy , to carry her along the path from which she could not think of turning . Every instrument must be laid hold of ; she had already made her brother an unconscious volunteer , and she next prepared her cousin to assist in the cause . The same fiction which had served with Mr. Chanson she made use of to Sir Peter . His flame for Laura was not such as to make him stand in the way of any serious matrimonial project ; on the contrary , he would have been proud to see her chosen by some cavalier of high merit , an alliance with whom would have made everything splendid and jovial , and creditable to his own admiration . That his cousin Laura should be neglected , or laid aside for another , was as impossible as it would be humiliating ; and Laura , who had a good insight into motives and character , availed herself of this feeling . She had only to sigh a little , and cast her eyes once or twice to the ceiling , before Sir Peter inquired whether anything on earth , that he could affect , had vexed his darling Laura ; and then , with a graceful show of candour , and of that confidence which a woman may show to a boy , but a boy already worth trusting , did Laura partly hint , and partly tell the same lie she had told her brother , and which she was beginning to believe herself . Sir Peter ’s indignation was boundless — his desire to approve himself her true knight zealous — he would fight Leslie to‐day if she pleased . Laura had only to temper his ardour , and to insinuate that at the , point matters were arrived at between herself and Leslie , anything which injured him , or drove him into a shyness of the family , would be fatal to her interests . No , the only thing Sir Peter could do , was to occupy Elinor ’s attention . a little , keep her from such “
26229	26233	26243	26243	Pet	57	” with Leslie . “
26249	26250	26247	26247	Peter	56	” “
26284	26382	26279	26280	a nun	103	” Accordingly , the day when Leslie thought proper to accept the invitation forwarded by Mr. Chanson , upon hearing from his sister that she had accidentally met him , Sir Peter went up to Elinor the moment she came into the drawing‐room , and forced her into talk , which he continued as he took her into dinner , and sat himself down beside her . Leslie had given his arm to Laura , as mistress of the house , and had quite determined to pay no attention to Elinor , such as could justify Laura in “
26385	26699	26734	26734	she	29	” with him ; but he was not prepared to see Elinor an object of attention to another ; and apparently well pleased to be so . And so , in fact , she was , for her whole being was at ease now that Leslie was returned , and she had leisure to listen to her companion , who was as young as herself , and very gay and droll , and made her laugh , as girls will at nonsense . Leslie had habits of perfect self‐control , though he was so young , and he forced himself to be at ease so successfully , that Laura could not determine in her own mind whether he observed what was going on or not . Careless as he seemed , however , he was watching them , and a jealous pang shot through Leslie ’s heart , as to whether it was possible that this young soldier should ever have indeed had an opportunity of seeing Elinor as he had done in that deep wood , by that fair fall of waters ; and though his consciousness said no , still the question made him watch uneasily the progress of their intercourse . After dinner , Sir Peter , intent on the interests of his cousin , still kept up the attempt to monopolise Elinor . He had provided for so doing by engaging her beforehand to sing a particular song for him , which , by a great effort of his memory ; he had succeeded in remembering to have heard from her the evening of his arrival , and when the party was settling to the employments of the evening , he followed Laura to the piano‐forte , near which Elinor was working , and while Laura played , began to request the execution of the promise he had obtained . “
26704	26708	26734	26734	she	29	” said Elinor , “
26738	26797	26734	26734	she	29	” Sir Peter could not but comply with this modest request , so unlike the answer of young ladies more in the world , and moved away , while Leslie abruptly took his place , sitting down beside her , and assuming that he had that right to her attention which a secret between them brought with it . “
26807	26811	26819	26819	you	0	” said he ; “
26830	26842	26819	26819	you	0	” Elinor looked up , frightened lest any one should hear . “
26850	26854	26843	26844	No one	1434	” said Leslie , “
26878	26879	26930	26930	you	0	” “
26882	26893	26930	26930	you	0	” said Elinor , with a sudden smile of surprise ; “
26903	26904	26930	26930	you	0	” “
26910	26916	26906	26906	you	0	” said Leslie , suddenly . “
26927	26928	26930	26930	you	0	” “
26934	26946	26930	26930	you	0	” repeated Leslie , smiling also , but urging his question . “
26951	26955	26930	26930	you	0	” said Elinor ; “
26977	26978	26980	26980	you	0	” “
26994	26995	26986	26986	you	0	” “
27003	27007	27008	27008	you	0	” said Elinor , “

27037	27041	27028	27028	I	0	” said Leslie . “

27105	27109	27093	27093	I	0	” said Elinor . “
27120	27124	27118	27118	yourself	0	” said Leslie . “
27154	27155	27156	27156	I	0	” “
27159	27163	27156	27156	I	0	” said Elinor ; “
27175	27176	27178	27178	you	0	” “
27190	27194	27178	27178	you	0	” said Leslie ; “
27215	27233	27210	27210	me	0	” Elinor rose , but hung back , while Leslie obtained Laura ’s permission . Laura assented . “
27272	27322	27259	27259	I	0	” And while she spoke , she looked round for her cousin , and summoned him by a glance , which he well understood , and rushed to the rescue , seeing which , Laura moved away , and left the coming skirmish to do what mischief it would . “
27334	27339	27323	27323	I	0	” said Sir Peter ; “
27352	27353	27350	27350	Adeste	58	” “
27372	27378	27354	27355	Miss Ladylift	21	” said Leslie , stiffly . “
27391	27401	27386	27386	you	0	” said Sir Peter , in the blandest tone . “
27417	27421	27424	27424	you	0	” said Leslie , “
27426	27427	27424	27424	you	0	” “
27430	27442	27424	27424	you	0	” said Elinor , frightened , and looking round for Laura . “
27463	27464	27424	27424	you	0	” “
27472	27477	27424	27424	you	0	” said Sir Peter , “
27498	27499	27500	27500	I	0	” “
27505	27516	27500	27500	I	0	” said Elinor , looking at Leslie humbly and appealingly . “
27520	27527	27518	27518	you	0	” said Leslie , very coldly ; “
27540	27541	27542	27542	I	0	” “
27549	27554	27555	27555	mine	0	” said Sir Peter ; “
27572	27573	27560	27561	Mr. Leslie	24	” “
27582	27586	27575	27576	Miss Ladylift	21	” said Leslie . “
27590	27608	27588	27588	I	0	” said Elinor , joyfully , thinking if she might settle it , the difficulty was over ; “
27623	27759	27620	27621	Mr. Leslie	24	” Leslie made no answer , except a bow , and stepping backward , withdrew from the circle round the piano‐forte ; nor returned to claim the song which Elinor , when she had got through Sir Peter ’s , at once looked round for him to hear . Her sham admirer did all in his power to take her attention from the real one , but Elinor could by no means regain the composure Leslie ’s displeasure had taken from her , and she sought with her timid eyes , all the evening , the opportunity of obtaining reconciliation , which he steadily withheld . Thus ended the first day of the visit , to which she had looked forward as the time of such happiness . Laura next morning took her to task . “
27771	27775	27620	27621	Mr. Leslie	24	” said she ; “
27795	27796	27793	27793	you	24	” “
27803	27814	27800	27801	a child	110	” said Elinor , in her sweet , humble voice ; “
27825	27826	27800	27801	a child	110	” “
27832	27838	27800	27801	a child	110	” said Laura , scornfully . “
27841	27866	27800	27801	a child	110	” said Elinor , hurt at being turned into ridicule , and at receiving reproof in a spirit that did not deserve that treatment . “
27870	27874	27879	27879	you	24	” said Laura , “
27883	27884	27885	27885	I	0	” “
27894	27895	27891	27892	Mr. Leslie	24	” “
27922	27926	27899	27899	you	24	” said Laura . “
27932	27938	27930	27930	I	0	” said Elinor , aghast . “
27941	27948	27930	27930	I	0	” answered Laura , breaking out ; “
27971	27972	27963	27963	I	0	” “
27980	28004	27974	27974	I	0	” said Elinor , who felt that if Leslie would forgive her , she would beg pardon from him with all her heart . “
28014	28018	28020	28020	my	0	” said Laura ; “
28051	28052	28053	28054	His wife	1171	” “
28056	28062	28076	28076	Wife	513	” cried Elinor , quickly ; “
28083	28084	28080	28080	you	0	” “
28180	28181	28172	28172	he	509	” “
28191	28200	28201	28201	he	509	” said Elinor , almost amazed to death ; “
28262	28263	28264	28264	You	0	” “
28270	28277	28264	28264	You	0	” said Laura , most disdainfully , “
28292	28293	28285	28285	his	509	” “
28300	28306	28285	28285	his	509	” said Elinor , bewildered ; “
28315	28316	28285	28285	his	509	” “
28331	28335	28319	28319	you	0	” said Laura . “
28345	28356	28336	28336	I	0	” said Elinor , seeking excuses for Leslie ’s kindness . “
28377	28378	28366	28366	he	509	” “
28392	28396	28397	28398	most women	517	” said Laura ; “
28439	28440	28428	28428	I	0	” “
28445	29214	28442	28442	I	0	” said Elinor , sadly , feeling so fearful , and so shy , that she could not comprehend the reproach , and as Laura was habitually out of temper with her , taking it as an instance of what she must meekly bear from her hostess , rather than as a true accusation against herself . It influenced her conduct however , towards Leslie , for under Laura ’s eye she could not act with the total unconsciousness of her behaviour hitherto ; she was obliged to act by rule , for she had no feeling of having transgressed a woman ’s duty , and therefore no impulse to direct her . There was , however , always such quiet maidenliness about her , that it was only by a shade that she was altered , and Leslie being on his high horse , did not so much as perceive it , but thought all the reserve , and all the withdrawal of friendliness was on his own side . Sir Peter learned through Laura , that his plot had succeeded , and took a boyish delight in the mischief made , over which he laughed with his cousin , as two children do over a ringdove in a string , which they are tormenting ; but Elinor , if she did not offer apologies to her kind friend Leslie , had no spirit or inclination to laugh or talk with Sir Peter , and was almost as silent to him as she had been to Leslie , the first time he sat by her at breakfast . In this mood , the amusements of the day were arranged . Men have a way of employing themselves at amusements , which causes their feelings to become secondary to their sports , and thus Leslie , angry , even anxious as he was , yet took it as a matter of course that he should join heart and soul in the pastime suggested by Sir Peter , and accepted by the Squire . This was a drag , which an adept sportsman was quickly sent forward to lead over the country , choosing puzzling places , and paths difficult to follow , in order to try the power of some young blood hounds belonging to Mr. Chanson . The most perplexing pass thus selected , was a profound gap in the country , at the bottom of which ran the brook which formed the waterfall in the wood ; and the rocky sides of which fringed with trees and bushes , rose very far above the bed of the stream . On one side of this , Laura promised to take her station , and Elinor was to accompany her in order to witness the achievements of the hounds in these difficult circumstances . There is no faster running than a drag , and luckily for the sportsmen , the day was a cool one , of the now declining autumn , and the slight frost made the scent puzzling enough to try the acumen of the eager hounds . They had a long circuit to make before they should reach the final point where the ladies were to await them , and these latter had arrived at the rendezvous some time before any sound of the chase broke upon the amber stillness of the autumn scene . They sat down together on the stump of a tree , Laura holding a book , and Elinor producing from the pocket of her black apron a bit of curiously fine cambric , on which she was working a cobweb pattern , the whole of which could have been rolled into a walnut shell . They were quite silent . Elinor was afraid of Laura , and her spirits froze under the unsympathetic influence . To‐day , especially she was shut into herself , and she mechanically pursued the occupation before her , so far pleased that Laura did not disturb her in it . At length the cheerfulest of sounds broke the silence , the distant tongue of hounds , rising and falling , bursting out and subsiding . It was a natural piano and forte exactly suiting woods and dingles , and inspiring the ear , which heard them for the first time , with the delight of an unexplored pleasure . Elinor , finely strung to sounds , took in these with a curiosity and enjoyment which made her fingers stay on her work , and her heart send a flush of blood into her changeful cheeks . “
29219	29235	29216	29216	they	522	” she said , at last , half rising , and looking at her companion . “
29240	29249	29216	29216	they	522	” said Laura , coldly , rising also ; “
29258	29259	29264	29264	they	522	” “
29284	29285	29286	29286	Everybody	1226	” “
29290	29921	29286	29286	Everybody	1226	” said Laura . She walked forward , and Elinor by her side , they approached very nearly the rocky gap worn by the water ; they could hear the boom of the waterfall far below and the unaccountable changefulness in the intensity of its sound which running water gives out . It was a wide gap , and presently the bay of the hounds increasing , they saw white spots glancing among the underwood , then the whole shape and colour of the hounds , full of the tension of the pursuit , and puzzling out their way to the brink of the chasm . Here the foremost threw up his head , and changed his note to one of distress ; others came up , scented the prey to the very edge , and then ceasing their cry of pursuit , seemed measuring the leap , and with distracted anxiety ran to and fro , tempting themselves to pass it . At this moment a horseman arrived ; he alighted , and cheered the hounds to persevere . It was Mr. Chanson himself ; he knew the secret pass intended for them , but would only act like magical music , applauding their better guesses , but not explaining wherein the achievement lay . They were maddened to accomplish it , by his voice , and at last the hound which first came up put himself over the edge , where there seemed no hold , and whimpering at what he was about to venture , passed down the rock a little way , seemed to find a point where the leap was possible , and presently breaking out into music again , was seen emerging almost perpendicularly on the other side of the chasm , and away in full cry on the opposite bank . Once taught the way , the others followed , and Mr. Chanson as soon as he saw they were over , turned his horse up the stream , and gallopped away to a further point where was a bridge . He met Sir Peter as he went , and turned him on the same path as himself ; a minute afterwards the third horseman came up , Leslie , making straight to the chasm . His horse and he had been down , as appeared by the mud they were covered with , and to make up for the time they had lost , were going their best pace on the track the rider judged by the sound , would bring him straight to the hounds . As he neared the chasm , he caught a glance of the horsemen who were now on the other side ; he checked the speed of his horse a little , encouraged him by his voice and hand , and then rode steadily towards the leap . Laura , aware of the danger , cried to him to turn up the stream , but though he saw the difficulty , and though he had no wish to be killed , he was at the age , when it seems a matter of course not to be killed , and not to fail ; and disregarding her entreaties , put his horse at the leap , and got safe over . Laura as pale as a corpse , shrieked loudly as he leaped . Elinor , quite ignorant there was any peril , was excited by the stirring sight , so that she clapped her hands , laughed , and leaped with delight . Leslie saw them both , and when the impetus following the leap slackened , he stopped his horse , and giving up the pursuit turned him , and dismounted beside the ladies . “
29929	29933	29922	29922	They	525	” said he ; “
29942	30011	30020	30020	he	526	” Laura had been so thoroughly frightened , that she did not instantly recover . She remonstrated with him on the rashness with genuine emotion , which he easily distinguished from any affected nervous‐ ness , and was flattered by it ; but it amused him much more to see Elinor ’s excited look , which turned to perplexity , as she heard and saw Laura ’s alarm . “
30022	30039	30020	30020	he	526	” said Leslie , looking cheerily at Elinor , whose face caught and returned his smile . “
30043	30047	30020	30020	he	526	” said Elinor ; “
30053	30054	30020	30020	he	526	” “
30060	30064	30065	30065	you	0	” said Laura ; “
30072	30073	30065	30065	you	0	” “
30081	30085	30065	30065	you	0	” said Leslie , “
30097	30098	30020	30020	he	526	” “
30104	30108	30020	30020	he	526	” said Elinor , “
30118	30119	30122	30122	you	0	” “
30126	30130	30122	30122	you	0	” said Leslie . “
30136	30147	30122	30122	you	0	” said Elinor ; answering quickly to his quick question , “
30187	30322	30325	30325	her	531	” Leslie laughed , and looked investigatingly at Elinor ’s face which had blushed brightly , as she replied to his imperative question , and he was thinking why she blushed . Laura was little pleased at this effect of Elinor ’s simplicity , and seeing him inclined to turn his attention entirely to her young companion , suddenly declared herself tired , and said they would go home . She chose a path along the rocky channel of the brook , where no horse could be even led , and could not refrain from turning her shoulder pettishly to Leslie as they parted . He scarcely observed it , he had forgotten also his reigned anger with Elinor , and he rode gently away , thinking of the little scene that had passed . “
30329	30333	30325	30325	her	531	” said he . “
30369	30430	30431	30431	I	0	” ELINOR accepted peace with Leslie gladly and gratefully . Nothing was said between them , but they resumed without words their former position . He did not want — from her at least — any show of spirit , or assertion of the rights of woman ; the meek glad cordiality of the young gift was what enchanted him . “
30450	30480	30448	30448	Laura	26	” said her brother . The word went like a dagger through her heart , but she smiled as though the thing were beneath notice , and said merely , “
30494	30555	30487	30487	he	534	” And Mr. Chanson was willing to adopt her view of the subject . Nevertheless he would have been glad the expected word should have been said , which plighted his guest and his sister ; and one morning as they stood together , after breakfast , in front of a great dahlia bed , he broke out into words . “
30601	30616	30586	30593	a woman of so much taste and manner	539	” Leslie had been profoundly meditating on Elinor , but roused himself to answer . “
30642	30643	30644	30644	Laura	26	” “
30656	30661	30672	30672	she	26	” said her brother , “
30688	30689	30686	30686	her	26	” “
30694	30706	30686	30686	her	26	” said Leslie . Mr. Chanson was warmed by this agreement . “
30765	30766	30767	30767	Kitsal	59	” “
30769	30792	30767	30767	Kitsal	59	” said Leslie , absently , but with a kind of wise voice , as though that word explained the whole matter . “
30799	30804	30767	30767	Kitsal	59	” said the Squire . “
30859	30860	30854	30854	I	0	” “
30871	30875	30854	30854	I	0	” said Leslie . “
30891	30892	30876	30876	I	0	” “
30955	31001	30953	30953	me	0	” Mr. Chanson was pleased with himself for this successful exposition of the advantages which an alliance with Laura held out , and when he saw Leslie in the course of the day talking with his sister , he repeated to himself with inward self applause “
31008	31022	30953	30953	me	0	” Sir Peter also tried to put in a good word for her ; “
31030	31043	31026	31027	my cousin	562	” said he , looking at her in a becoming evening dress ; “
31058	31059	31044	31044	she	562	” “
31075	31076	31106	31106	you	0	” “
31086	31094	31095	31095	Sparrow	60	” said Sir Peter , designating Elinor . “
31112	31116	31100	31100	she	562	” said Leslie . “
31147	31162	31135	31135	her	562	” Nobody ever caught Leslie wincing under a sudden attack , he answered readily . “
31174	31179	31165	31165	she	562	” Sir Peter laughed ; “
31183	31187	31180	31180	I	0	” said he , “
31220	31221	31223	31223	I	0	” “
31225	31229	31223	31223	I	0	” said Leslie , “
31255	31256	31257	31257	I	0	” “
31263	31268	31257	31257	I	0	” said Sir Peter , “
31294	31295	31257	31257	I	0	” “
31303	31307	31257	31257	I	0	” said Leslie . “
31315	31320	31308	31308	You	0	” said Sir Peter . “
31323	31339	31308	31308	You	0	” said Leslie , in a quite altered tone , which sounded very much like , “
31345	31491	31492	31492	I	0	” But Elinor ! Leslie felt she did not love him , that her regard was one of respect and liking , such as she felt for the old Holy Mother in the convent , only tempered by the unholiness of his sex and conversation , and he did not know but what the giddy and prattling Sir Peter might succeed in inspiring those feelings of which she was hitherto ignorant . But he could have no intentions except those of amusing himself for the hour , and Leslie felt quite indignant that any man except himself , should entertain views which could interfere with her happiness . He resolved to warn her ; and at dinner when a large party were all talking , he asked her what were her engagements for the next day . Elinor did not know that she had any . “
31511	31519	31492	31492	I	0	” she added , after a pause . “
31531	31569	31522	31522	you	56	” said Leslie , abruptly . His tone made her blush suddenly , for it alarmed her with the feeling of having unconsciously said what she ought not ; but after two or three seconds she answered , “
31575	31621	31571	31571	I	0	” Leslie did not believe her , he saw the rising blood , and interpreted it his own way ; but the one truth told about her intended walk was enough effort , without requiring a second about her motive , and he went on , “
31629	31630	31626	31626	you	56	” “
31633	31639	31571	31571	I	0	” said Elinor , astonished . “
31652	31656	31657	31657	you	56	” said he , “
31662	31663	31657	31657	you	56	” “
31666	31670	31671	31671	I	0	” asked Elinor , “
31678	31679	31671	31671	I	0	” “
31743	31744	31746	31746	you	565	” “
31749	31753	31746	31746	you	565	” said Elinor . “
31771	31772	31778	31778	he	566	” “
31789	31790	31785	31785	I	0	” “
31818	31875	31878	31880	that inveterate flirt	569	” Elinor instantly agreed ; and after this they talked on other subjects , about which , although Elinor laughed a great deal less than with Sir Peter , she was far more deeply interested , and forgot every one else , while his low voice , and her lower rejoinder was suffered to continue uninterrupted . “
31882	32091	31878	31880	that inveterate flirt	569	” said Sir Peter to Laura , by whose side he sat ; and Laura with death in her heart , was cross to her cousin , and conveyed in obscure language , which had a clear meaning for him , that he did not help her , and was either clumsy or careless . The boy was piqued at this , to strain his efforts for better success , and it was therefore with eagerness that he watched next morning , lest the promised walk should escape him ; but , Leslie also had his attention alive , and in order to give Elinor a good excuse for not going out , he made use of a means , which no object less interesting could have induced him to bring into play . This was a literary effort of his own , a poem which he could willingly have read to a severe judge , who would have treated it according to its own faults or merits ; but very unwillingly to an audience whose admiration was determined beforehand , by the fact that it was their guest and friend who wrote it . Laura ’s eagerness to accept his offer was based on exactly this reason . “
32101	32103	31878	31880	that inveterate flirt	569	”BOILEAU . “
32152	32153	32136	32136	his	24	” “
32156	32160	32136	32136	his	24	” said Leslie , “
32180	32181	32168	32168	I	0	” “
32226	32227	32221	32221	she	21	” “
32233	32292	32295	32295	they	572	” said the candid Leslie . Accordingly , to this select committee , he about half an hour after this time unfolded his MS . , and told them it was a few verses , which he had a mind to send to a magazine then in fashion , to see whether they would be accepted or not . “
32298	32302	32303	32303	they	572	” said Laura , “
32316	32317	32303	32303	they	572	” “
32323	32327	32319	32319	they	572	” said Leslie , “
32373	32374	32375	32375	I	0	” “
32382	32386	32388	32388	you	0	” said Laura . “
32393	32400	32388	32388	you	0	” said Leslie , to Elinor . “
32417	32460	32461	32461	I	0	” said Elinor . Leslie smiled , and Laura flattered herself he was comparing the childish simplicity of the young girl , with her own confidence in his genius . It was a poem of some ten or twelve quatrains , beginning , “
32469	32567	32461	32461	I	0	” verses which were afterwards sealed with public applause , and which delighted Leslie himself ; but , he had no confidence that they would be approved by others . The approbation on this occasion was unbounded on the part of the mistress of the house ; but the author was not at all touched by it , except so far as he considered it a homage to his own personal merits ; indeed he thought none of them able to form any useful judgment , but he had a mind to hear what Elinor would say . “
32576	32580	32573	32573	I	0	” said Elinor . “
32587	32591	32592	32592	I	0	” cried Laura , “
32601	32653	32592	32592	I	0	” Elinor coloured up to her eyes , at being thus convicted of misapprehension ; but Leslie smiled brightly , and after a few seconds said she was quite right ; as he read it , he had himself been struck by the necessity of cutting out some of the stanzas . “
32667	32671	32662	32662	one	1228	” said he ; “
32681	32881	32674	32674	you	576	” Elinor answered nothing at all to this , and Leslie had not expected she could . The morning had worn on meantime , and when the party seemed likely to disperse , Elinor had withdrawn to her room , and it was plain to Sir Peter that his chance was over for the present . He took Laura into the conservatory just outside , and here their conversation soon began to break into gleeful laughter , and exclamations of capital ! and then hush ! and foolish boy ! Leslie paid no attention , but went his way , with his verses in his hand , remodelling what he thought faulty , and intent on showing the approving answer of the magazine when it should arrive , to his late audience . In no long time after , he was summoned to luncheon , and then to an expedition which had been arranged to a neighhouring lion . When the ladies had gone upstairs to get their cloaks and bonnets , hats and habits , Laura followed Elinor into her room , and in a friendly tone asked whether she particularly wished to go to Gilbert ’s Glen . “
32889	32903	32882	32882	I	0	” said Elinor , not sure what answer the question meant to get . “
32918	32919	32953	32953	you	0	” “
32933	32934	32924	32924	I	0	” “
32939	32943	32945	32945	you	0	” said Laura ; “
32948	32949	32945	32945	you	0	” “
32957	32958	32945	32945	you	0	” “
33021	33022	33012	33012	you	0	” “
33030	33042	33043	33043	Peter	56	” said Elinor , speaking suddenly the thought that instantly occurred . “
33060	33103	33043	33043	Peter	56	” Elinor coloured again , at her mistake , and willingly undertook Laura ’s commission . Pleased at her success , Laura descended the staircase , and found the party assembled in the hall , some for riding , some for driving . “
33110	33115	33106	33107	Miss Ladylift	21	” said Sir Peter . “
33128	33132	33133	33133	she	21	” said Laura ; “
33178	33240	33175	33175	she	21	” Thus glibly lying , Laura got into the phaeton , and the party set off . Leslie had been appointed to drive Laura ; therefore he saw nothing of the movements of the rest , till they arrived at the destined place , and assembled to walk up the glen ; then both he and his companions missed Sir Peter . “
33247	33259	33175	33175	she	21	” said one of the girls who had come on horseback , “
33277	33278	33264	33265	Mr. Chanson	37	” “
33281	33285	33264	33265	Mr. Chanson	37	” cried Laura , “
33293	33294	33288	33289	my brother	482	” “
33312	33313	33317	33317	he	56	” “
33321	33338	33317	33317	he	56	” said Laura . Leslie meantime spoke to the groom who had accompanied the riding party . “
33347	33353	33317	33317	he	56	” said he , indifferently . “
33363	33368	33361	33361	sir	372	” said the groom ; “
33378	33759	33370	33371	Sir Peter	56	” Leslie feared Sir Peter had taken more interesting matter on his‐self than conveying home a lame horse , and instantly he suspected Elinor of being a party to this pre‐arranged lameness of Rampage ; and he resolved to know what it all meant . He followed the party who had walked forward into the glen , and expressing his admiration of the scene to Laura , said he should like to climb the right side of the valley , where the rocks were steepest , and would join her again at the farthest outlet ; but , if he should not be arrived by the time they reached it , they were not to wait . Laura gave an easy assent , which was more than he expected ; but he had been prepared to disregard any remonstrance she might make , and therefore at once struck away into the wood , and having lost sight of the rest , turned , and came straight to the inn where the horses were being put up . The present of a sovereign convinced the groom that it could do the horse he had ridden no harm to turn round and carry Mr. Leslie home , and that he , the groom , was to return in the vacated seat of the phaeton . Accordingly Leslie mounted and riding gently away for the first quarter of a mile gradually increased his horse ’s speed , till he was going at a good hand‐gallop back on the road to Chanson Wood . Had Sir Peter been cautiously riding a lame horse , Leslie must have over‐ taken him , but he did no such thing , and this convinced him more and more that the sudden lameness was a mere fiction , fitting into the sudden headache which he believed to be equally fictitious . When he came to the house , nobody was there — the servants knew nothing — had not seen Miss Ladylift go out or come in . Leslie had met with Rampage in the stableyard being led about quite cured of his lameness , but not yet of his perspiration ; his own horse required similar cares , and the head groom uttered anathemas upon young gentlemen ’s “
33764	33788	33370	33371	Sir Peter	56	” such as often follow upon young gentlemen ’s excited passions which the grooms leave out of the account when they attribute all to “
33791	34183	33760	33762	hignorance of orses	585	” Turning at once to the wood , Leslie strode along the path which led to the quarry , with all the feelings of an injured man , and in a very short time had reached the hill , the highest point of which contained the quarry . It was dotted with trees in natural clumps , growing from rocky ledges which broke out over the surface from top to bottom , and among these the path wound , appearing and disappearing in its descent to the level ground . He stood a moment at the bottom , feeling that his appearance in pursuit of his rival would not wear a very dignified aspect , and while this occurred to him , two figures emerged for a moment from the wood to an open space and again disappeared among the trees . Leslie ’s eyes were fixed on the next opening , devouring the space beforehand ; again the figures came and vanished , but nearer and plainer , and near and plain enough to know they were Elinor and Sir Peter . Leslie ground his teeth — to be deceived was one of the bitter feelings‐that a creature so guileless as she seemed should have deceived , and been believed by him , was another . He thought at first he would meet and confound her by mere silence — then he would have given much not to have returned , and not to be found out by her in such interest as to watch her . Under this sudden thought he dashed into the thick of the wood , and there , from safe distances , again fixed his eyes on the path along which they must go . They passed very near , Sir Peter carrying her basket , and talking with great animation . Elinor ’s face was hidden by her great hat and veil ; she was saying nothing as she passed , but how could she when her companion was so loquacious ? enough , enough , she was walking with him ! They passed on , and Leslie strode away , burying himself in the woods till nearly dinner time , and then dressed furiously , and came down to the drawing‐room as placidly and calmly as if not one disturbed thought raged within . “
34192	34196	34189	34190	Mr. Leslie	24	” said Laura ; “
34206	34207	34198	34198	you	586	” “
34210	34214	34198	34198	you	586	” said Leslie ; “
34249	34256	34232	34232	I	0	” Laura let the subject drop . “
34260	34269	34270	34270	Elinor	21	” she said , turning to the table ; “
34306	34307	34298	34298	They	593	” “
34310	34319	34298	34298	They	593	” said Leslie , and turned to Elinor . “
34330	34339	34298	34298	They	593	” said he , in the blandest tone , “
34344	34356	34320	34320	You	21	” Irreproachable as the voice was , it made her colour . “
34359	34368	34320	34320	You	21	” she said , in a low voice ; “
34371	34395	34396	34396	You	21	” the disjunctive conjunction was indicated , not spoken through , and Leslie , taking up two or three in his hand , said “
34415	34416	34320	34320	You	21	” “
34419	34423	34320	34320	You	21	” said Elinor ; “
34427	34428	34429	34429	I	0	” “
34440	34445	34429	34429	I	0	” said Sir Peter . “
34450	34726	34429	34429	I	0	” said Leslie , as if the explanation were most satisfactory , and he would not catch the eyes of Elinor , which he felt sought his , to explain or deprecate , or deceive — he thought the latter . And now for the next few days Leslie behaved like a brute to Elinor ; a polished brute , bringing her shawl , setting her chair , opening the door with frigid politeness , but never once looking her in the face ; never coming near for a word of explanation , never entering into what she said or did ; never including her in any project or employment . All the time he felt he was straightening , rather than loosing the bond between them , for he was aware she was intent upon explanation , and that at any moment by a return to kindliness he could open all the pent‐up feelings of that guileless heart ; yes , guileless , for in his most secret thought he was convinced there was no guile in Elinor , though he chose to say , even to himself , there was . Meantime , she was so unhappy that she sometimes rebelled against it ; she seriously thought she would return to her convent , and hide herself from a world where plainly nobody cared for her . When all her efforts to speak to Leslie , and to conciliate him , failed — when he persevered in mortifying her , and in affecting unconsciousness of her presence , her heart rose quite full of tears , and seemed too swollen for her bosom . “
34737	34959	34730	34730	he	595	” she said to herself , but Leslie did not melt , though he saw her eyes cloud with what he knew were tears , suppressed though they might be . Laura saw all this and was delighted ; she thought her plans were working their full effect ; and Leslie ’s attention to her , which was mostly aimed at vexing Elinor , she readily deceived herself into thinking was wholly to please herself . She was in great spirits ; she looked very handsome , and did all that she could imagine would best please her favoured guest . His poem she continually brought forward till he dreaded the very mention of it . Every post , she remembered not to forget her interest about the expected answer , and each time she expressed her conviction that the editor would only not know how to give it sufficient welcome . Leslie felt confident enough of that also , but the pudeur of composition ( when the author has written what he felt ) made him shrink from so much talk about it . It was the fourth morning after his estrangement from Elinor that the letters as usual being brought round at breakfast , Laura ’s inquiry again broke in on Leslie ’s glance over those laid beside him . “
34964	34993	34730	34730	he	595	yet?”—and he , breaking open the seal of a business‐like looking one , ran his eye down the page , and replied in rather an unnecessarily indifferent tone , “
35000	35022	34996	34996	they	596	” Laura had not much tact ; instead of dropping so distasteful a subject , she could not let it alone . “
35062	35063	35054	35054	they	596	” “
35072	35076	35054	35054	they	596	” said Leslie ; “
35089	35106	35107	35107	I	0	” and he folded each fold of the paper , and put it into his pocket . “
35116	35120	35110	35110	you	597	” said Laura ; “
35134	35245	35246	35248	Poor Mr. Leslie	24	” So she went on , not conscious how this effort to show the author was not mortified , pressed on him the assurance that everybody saw he was . Leslie , however , turned the matter into laughter , wished his enemy might write a book ; and , in fact , took the rejection to heart very little after the first moment of making it public . But Elinor had seen that he was vexed for some instants , and when the ladies were lingering in the morning‐room before separating for their several avocations , she had heard Laura making much of it to the circle round her . “
35250	35254	35246	35248	Poor Mr. Leslie	24	” she said ; “
35268	35579	35262	35262	he	24	” In the innocence of her heart , Elinor deduced that he had suffered a great fall , that he was humbled , he who had been so proud and lofty in every way . She glided away , unnoticed ; and with a beating heart reached the door of the library , where Leslie was reading , forgetful , probably of the whole matter ; or , if he thought of it at all , merely resolving to annihilate the editor some day or other , by giving all his support to the rival magazine . He did not look up , though he saw in a mirror opposite that it was Elinor , and his heart quickened its throb in consequence ; but he would not relax from his unkindness . She had laid her little plan for doing him a sort of homage , in what she looked upon to be adverse circumstances , and in pursuance of it had already sought for , and found a book , the only circumstance about which that interested her , was that the text in one page was mixed with a certain number of Latin verses , which verses she meant to be her allies in her harmless stratagem . Yet she hesitated for a minute before carrying her plan into execution , and in the mirror he contrived to watch her , without attracting her observation . He saw her timid approach , he marked the pause she made , and how she lightly pressed her small white teeth upon her under lip , like one in perplexity about the thing she was going to do . Presently she resolved to come forward , and did so hastily ; upon which , Leslie rose , and was ceremoniously placing a chair for her , when she broke in . “
35604	35624	35596	35596	you	599	” He took the book a little surprised at her request , and read into English four lines beginning — “
35633	35634	35596	35596	you	599	” “
35638	35648	35636	35636	you	599	” said Elinor , looking him in the face , “
35668	35683	35636	35636	you	599	” Leslie returned her look , trying to comprehend what this little scene meant . “
35689	35693	35636	35636	you	599	” said he , “
35701	35727	35695	35695	you	0	” and he turned to the title page of the little volume . Elinor did not know ; she held out her hand for it . “
35731	35735	35813	35813	she	34	” said she , “
35739	35766	35813	35813	she	34	” and she tried to catch the title at the top of the page , Leslie saw in a moment that she knew nothing about it . “
35778	35782	35768	35768	you	0	” said he . “
35786	35790	35768	35768	you	0	” said Elinor . “
35800	35804	35813	35813	she	34	” said Leslie . “
35824	35825	35813	35813	she	34	” “
35831	35839	35827	35827	she	34	” said Elinor , in sincerest alarm . “
35857	35870	35871	35871	she	34	” ( he knew perfectly well she had not read a word of it)—“that
35884	35885	35871	35871	she	34	” “
35891	35895	35888	35888	she	34	” said Elinor , “
35910	35911	35899	35899	I	0	” “
35921	35925	35913	35913	you	599	” said Leslie , “
35953	35954	35978	35978	You	599	” “
35958	35965	35966	35966	I	0	” said Elinor , more embarrassed , “
35976	35977	35978	35978	You	599	” “
35981	35992	35978	35978	You	599	” said Leslie , his whole manner changing to tenderness , “
36006	36007	35999	35999	you	599	” “
36015	36019	35999	35999	you	599	” she murmured . “
36085	36086	36073	36073	your	599	” “
36089	36093	36073	36073	your	599	” said Elinor , “
36101	36102	36094	36094	I	0	” “
36106	36110	36111	36111	you	599	” said Leslie ; “
36158	36159	36156	36156	myself	0	” “
36168	36172	36162	36162	you	599	” said Elinor . “
36265	36303	36252	36252	Elinor	21	” Elinor stood speechless , puzzled by his change of manner , uncertain whether he was displeased at first , amazed at his earnest expressions , and perfectly bewildered by the prayer to which it all led . “
36309	36325	36306	36306	I	0	” she said , at last , and Leslie ’s earnestness increased with his uncertainty . “
36335	36339	36306	36306	I	0	” he said ; “
36376	36378	36370	36370	you	21	” . “
36387	36391	36392	36392	you	21	” said Elinor , “
36400	36401	36394	36394	you	21	” “
36426	36427	36442	36443	your guardian	1132	” “
36435	36439	36429	36431	only Mr. Chanson	37	” said Elinor . “
36478	36502	36506	36506	he	1132	” Elinor smiled , and her bright , shy eyes were kindled almost to laughter , but she answered with a grave voice . “
36517	36518	36506	36506	he	1132	” “
36526	36530	36520	36520	they	613	” said Leslie , “
36655	36687	36698	36698	you	21	” Elinor was silent , but she was listening to every word ; her eyes had fallen from his , but her hand rested in the grasp of his two hands . “
36714	36715	36716	36716	I	0	” “
36724	36728	36718	36718	I	0	” said Elinor . “
36775	36776	36786	36786	he	619	” “
36779	36785	36786	36786	he	619	” said Elinor , thinking , “
36793	36802	36786	36786	he	619	” while through Leslie ’s mind it glanced — “
36827	36832	36821	36821	her	620	” Aloud he said , “
36871	36888	36821	36821	her	620	” and now his hand unforbidden got round her waist . Elinor began to understand him . “
36901	36905	36821	36821	her	620	” she said ; “
36915	36916	36907	36908	Mr. Chanson	37	” “
36989	37376	37377	37377	She	627	” Elinor was glad to be allowed silence , she would have felt it a painful task , to say anything so interesting to Mr. Chanson , to whom she never talked ; or to Laura , of whom she was afraid ; and she went out of that room full of a consciousness of the great thing that had happened , yet apparently as much the same quiet Elinor , as it was possible to be . Leslie was equally self‐controlled , he wished beyond measure to keep his secret , and therefore succeeded ; there was no covert thought prompting either of them to let it be discovered , and therefore there was a perfect simplicity and good faith in their manner of doing it . The days following were a time of incredible happiness to Leslie . He had been vanquished by generous and good feelings suddenly getting the mastery over him , and he was lifted above the base purposes which he had entertained towards Elinor . He enjoyed his own better feelings , the nobler part of his nature took the place of the baser , and had an artistic attraction for him ; he felt himself freer for great things than before , he had the pleasure of loving what was not himself , yet his own ; and although he was unable to conceive the guileless purity of the young girl , he was more and more captivated by the degree of it , which he could not help discerning , as he became more intimate with her thoughts and ways . Elinor was awakening to the hopes and happiness of life ; the Being under whose influence these prospects unfolded themselves , became her one interest , and identified himself with all her feelings . She opened her heart to his love , and mused upon his home , his society , their position together as dwellers under one roof , mused with the innocence of a child which hears many things , but has no interpreter within , by which to understand them . She would have been contented with this state of things for an indefinite length of time , but Leslie began to entertain some remorse as to the part he was playing by Laura . “
37382	37388	37377	37377	She	627	” he said to himself . “
37417	37502	37408	37408	I	0	” Accordingly , one morning , when he knew her to be alone in her sitting‐room , he bade Elinor make some pretence for going to her there , and when she had been in the room for a few minutes , he also knocked at the door , and on hearing permission , went in . Laura rose hastily , with a look of sudden wonder , and of some other emotion which prompted her to get rid of Elinor by all means . “
37513	37517	37504	37504	you	631	” she said ; “
37531	37537	37547	37547	I	0	” but Leslie interrupted her . “
37540	37544	37547	37547	I	0	” he said , “
37566	37616	37617	37618	This lady	1196	” He observed , though without fixing his eyes on Laura ’s face that there was a kind of horror in it , such as comes when an object of phantom‐like dread rises before one , and the mind refuses to believe it . He immediately finished his sentence . “
37620	37625	37617	37618	This lady	1196	” Leslie indicated Elinor , “
37645	37754	37638	37638	you	1196	” The blood forsook Laura ’s lips ; her heart it was plain had stopped , so far as a heart can stop which is to go again . The nerves relaxed , so that the strong will could hardly make instruments of them ; but she did force them to act . She smiled as some one among us may have seen a dying man attempt to smile when the power over his muscles was half departed ; she looked on both with eyes where were no tears , the conventionalities of society held them back . Leslie went on speaking , without appearing to observe her . “
37796	37797	37826	37826	he	482	” “
37801	37813	37826	37826	he	482	” said Laura , speaking with a steadily , uniform voice ; “
37837	37838	37826	37826	he	482	” “
37841	37847	37839	37839	Obstacles	65	” said Leslie , carelessly . “
37869	37870	37854	37854	he	482	” “
37874	37878	37854	37854	he	482	” said Leslie ; “
37915	37916	37920	37920	your	1196	” “
37926	37930	37920	37920	your	1196	” said Laura . “
37938	37954	37933	37933	I	0	” said Leslie : in order to convey some pleasant impression to Laura ’s mind . “
37958	37962	37963	37963	I	0	” he said , “
38011	38471	38003	38003	she	646	” Leslie drew back , courteously applying his compliment by a slight indication of his head , and quitted the room , after an encouraging glance at Elinor . When he was gone , the agitation of the scene acted upon Elinor , and she could not restrain her tears , while she tried to possess herself of Laura ’s hand , but Laura ’s efforts were exhausted ; she drew away her hand as if it had come in contact with a fester , or a nest of snakes , and forcing open the door to her bed‐room flung it behind her , and fell on the floor by her bed , totally giddy and beside herself for a brief time . In some people , their first thought under a sudden shock is , that the thing is not ; or that it will cease to be . In the worst of her anguish this latter idea spread a gloomy light through the thick darkness , otherwise no strength of hers could have supported it . It was that which by degrees gave consistency to her thoughts , and upon which her mind as tenaciously laid hold , as the falling man , on the bush which grows over the edge of the precipice . She collected her senses and forced her mind into action , not with any view ever entertained for a moment of making the best for herself and others of what had taken place , but with the desperate purpose of destroying it at no matter what sacrifice . The first thing was to gain time , and this her instinct had already prompted her to do , when she besought Leslie to keep the secret for awhile . What was to follow she ran over in her head , and sate in her tranquil room , among all , the pretty luxuries of toilette and draperied mirror , of flaçons and flowers , leaning her rounded cheek on her hand , while the natural folds of rich silk fell around her figure , and all this time was brooding the project which should immolate the innocent girl , and the beloved man to the idol enshrined in her own person . To this end she laid her plan , and with farsighted anticipation she soon after sought her brother , and engaged him by gentle degrees in a conversation on his political interest , which had always a certain charm for him . There was some property at a little distance lately acquired by him , where the votes of the tenants were less their landlord ’s than those which had longer felt his subject of discourse , and suggested the propriety of “
38481	38545	38003	38003	she	646	” cultivating their acquaintance and gaining a hold on their opinions . Her brother assented , but complained of the tediousness of the operation . Laura hinted that he should lighten the disgust by taking a companion ; some one , she said , who would do credit to the cause , and whom he might recommend to them whenever there was occasion . “
38551	38556	38003	38003	she	646	” said Mr. Chanson ; “
38577	38578	38560	38560	I	0	” “
38589	38593	38584	38584	I	0	” said Laura . “
38596	38597	38581	38581	you	0	” “
38612	38613	38628	38633	the woman to be trifled with	652	” “
38635	38636	38625	38625	Laura	26	” “
38673	38674	38675	38675	I	0	” “
38684	38688	38675	38675	I	0	” said he ; “
38738	38739	38731	38731	I	0	” “
38745	38781	38743	38743	Lawrence	51	” said Miss Chanson , and the kindness breathed over her heart like dew upon some burning , arid plain . The tears came to her eyes , and she hid them on his shoulder . “
38788	38794	38743	38743	Lawrence	51	” said he , inquiringly ; “
38799	38800	38795	38795	you	26	” “
38803	38807	38795	38795	you	26	” said Laura ; “
38815	38919	38920	38920	Peter	56	” It was very hard to form those words , but she succeeded . She had provided in this manœuvre for securing the absence of Leslie whenever her plans should require such a movement to work out the present details . She had only her cousin Peter to help her , and in the late circumstances of apparent estrangement between Leslie and Elinor , he had been laid aside as not wanted . Now , however , he was her chief hope ; and the day of his departure drawing very near , what he had to do must be done without delay . “
38922	38926	38920	38920	Peter	56	” she said , “
38959	38960	38950	38950	she	657	” “
38966	38971	38962	38962	you	0	” said her cousin ; “
38991	38992	38984	38984	she	657	” “
39001	39005	39006	39006	he	24	” said Laura , “
39022	39023	39026	39026	Laura	26	” “
39028	39029	39030	39030	He	24	” “
39054	39055	39044	39044	she	657	” “
39060	39061	39058	39058	Laura	26	” “
39091	39092	39058	39058	Laura	26	” “
39147	39148	39128	39128	I	0	” “
39157	39158	39151	39151	you	0	” “
39169	39179	39151	39151	you	0	” said Laura , to the party after luncheon , “
39197	39245	39151	39151	you	0	” Everybody agreed , and they assembled gradually under the portico , as they were ready , previous to the start . Leslie had gently driven Laura into a corner , and in the fulness of contentment with himself and others , was asking questions sufficiently embarrassing . “
39270	39282	39283	39283	You	0	” Laura commanded her voice , and made some trifling answer . “
39297	39302	39290	39290	I	0	” Leslie went on ; “
39333	39334	39324	39324	you	0	” “
39341	39345	39324	39324	you	0	” said Laura , “
39361	39362	39364	39364	you	0	” “
39371	39384	39364	39364	you	0	” said Leslie , who felt that he owed her some reparation . “
39397	39401	39386	39386	yourself	0	” said Laura . “
39440	39441	39463	39463	they	272	” “
39453	39457	39444	39444	you	0	” said Laura . “
39466	39470	39463	39463	they	272	” said Leslie , “
39499	39500	39444	39444	you	0	” “
39511	39520	39444	39444	you	0	” said Laura , then hastily went on . “
39556	39889	39547	39548	the party	1575	” She moved a step forward , and so did Leslie , and saw that Elinor was standing just within the door , and that the officious Sir Peter had offered her his arm for the walk . Laura eagerly watching also , perceived that Elinor lifted her eyes to Leslie , and that a slight glance of intelligence passed between them , after which Elinor demurely took the offered arm , and proceeded with Sir Peter . That look wrenched the dagger round in Laura ’s heart ; it was the thing which her imagination had represented as most intolerable , the familiar token which both understood , and from which all others were shut out ; her insidious words had fallen useless , and now , friendly as Leslie might be , faithfully as he kept by her side , he did but confirm her anguish by a behaviour which was so friendly , merely because he had made her the confidant of his successful love for another . She could not play out her part to the end to‐day . She was obliged to complain of a headache before the walk was over , and sank into silence , which this excuse justified , and which with her throbbing head and dry lips , it was impossible for her to avoid . When they reached home again , she went straight to her room , and appeared no more , accepting Elinor ’s timid offers of service , in order to keep her away from the society of Leslie . For a time she preserved the impenetrable silence which her feelings dictated and which Elinor , frightened at the repulses she met , shrank into herself to observe ; but at last , as she slowly won self‐command , she resolved to employ the time in preparing the ground for the scheme before her , and however odious to herself to enter into conversation with the happy young girl . “
39898	39907	39547	39548	the party	1575	” she began , in an invalid tone , “
39913	39933	39547	39548	the party	1575	” Elinor was as little inclined as she to pour out confidences , but she hesitated not to answer . “
39941	39945	39934	39934	I	0	” she began ...... “
39948	39954	39934	39934	I	0	” said Laura , impatiently . “
39962	39966	39958	39958	he	675	” said Elinor . “
39972	39979	39969	39969	you	0	” again said Laura , hastily . “
39984	39985	39980	39980	He	675	” “
39998	39999	40000	40001	Your cousin	676	” “
40003	40018	40023	40023	I	0	” Elinor began , but was glad to be interrupted by her imperious sympathizer . “
40102	40103	40104	40104	I	0	” “
40108	40109	40112	40112	you	0	” “
40150	40151	40123	40124	Mr. Leslie	24	” “
40158	40159	40123	40124	Mr. Leslie	24	” “
40171	40172	40165	40165	you	0	” “
40178	40179	40185	40185	you	0	” “
40199	40204	40185	40185	you	0	” Elinor was silent . “
40216	40217	40213	40213	I	0	” “
40220	40221	40213	40213	I	0	” “
40242	40243	40236	40236	you	0	” “
40248	40249	40246	40246	he	56	” “
40329	40330	40332	40332	he	56	” “
40335	40339	40332	40332	he	56	” said Elinor . “
40358	40359	40360	40360	I	0	” “
40370	40371	40332	40332	he	56	” “
40383	40384	40385	40385	I	0	” “
40394	40398	40385	40385	I	0	” said Elinor . “
40433	40835	40836	40836	I	0	” And now putting her hand to her head , she leaned it down against the back of her easy chair , and there in anything but ease , she acted the motionless invalid , in which character she could escape further conversation , yet retain the young girl as nurse , and watch in her room . This lasted till bed time , and a severe trial it was . When at last she had dismissed Elinor , with severe directions to go at once to her chamber , and had got rid of the importunate services of her maid , she was at liberty to start up , and walking through her room , to give vent to the bodily expressions of the tempest in her mind . The one fixed purpose was that the marriage of Elinor and Leslie should be prevented . She had ceased to justify that purpose to herself , and had reached the point when the right or wrong was cast aside , and the end only , kept resolutely in view . When all the house was quiet , when her brother had come , and tenderly stroked her hair , asking how his little Laura did now ; when he was gone , carefully closing the door without noise behind him , Laura unlocked her desk , pressed the spring of the secret drawer within , and took out a slip of written paper , poor Elinor ’s note to Leslie , which had fallen on the ground the night of their interview in the wood . And there in the early hours , between night and morning , when she ought to have been stretched in maiden slumber on her bed , when she ought to have been profiting by the safety and the indulgence of her prosperous position , Laura sat cold and weary , yet absorbed from such feelings , patiently effacing by the smallest advances one letter after another from the harmless billet , in order to replace them by others which should carry condemnation to the guiltless writer . Her brother ’s name was the word she rubbed out ; and then with a pen , prepared with the most delicate touches of the knife , and tried twenty times before it suited her , Leslie ’s was the one she put in . Now it stood — “
40851	40946	40949	40949	despised	687	” This note thus altered , she purposed to convey to Sir Peter as coming from Elinor , and from him it should pass either by Sir Peter , or by Laura herself to Leslie , whom she trusted it would persuade of Elinor ’s falsity , and by so doing wrench two hearts asunder . There were chances of an explanation between them , and that Laura saw with fearful distinctness ; should it take place , her plot was ruined , and she herself with it — where should she be then ? “
40951	40957	40949	40949	despised	687	” she cried to herself ; “
40995	41061	40988	40988	Death	66	” and as she said so , tears of self‐compassion broke from her eyes , and she laid her head on her arms and wept . Presently she rose from this position , and letting her dressing‐gown fall from her shoulders , put one knee on her luxurious bed , and laid herself down beneath the fine woollen , fine linen of the bed clothes . “
41064	41070	40988	40988	Death	66	” she said to herself , “
41108	41147	41148	41149	Miss Chanson	29	” THE next morning , after breakfast , Leslie contrived to say to Elinor , that he had been unjustly deprived of her society the previous evening , and that she must come out and walk with him . “
41156	41160	41148	41149	Miss Chanson	29	” he added ; “
41190	41191	41177	41178	her brother	195	” “
41194	41198	41199	41199	he	195	” said Elinor , “
41235	41236	41221	41221	I	0	” “
41253	41259	41261	41261	she	29	” said Leslie to himself ; “
41304	41496	41497	41497	I	0	” In about a quarter of an hour Elinor did as she had proposed and joined him in the garden , and then seizing her hand he led her into the park and out thence to the fields , and soon they were quite away from all frequented track . It was an autumn day , the heavy mists were golden with the sun which was vigorously dispelling them from the valleys and brook courses , and lifting them up all gorgeously from the glowing earth . The red berries of the wild convolvulus hung in long festoons upon the hedges , and its yellow leaves shone like pale gold in the sun . The wild cherry trees were glowing with bright red , the birch all amber ; the ferns dressed the hill sides with their rich shapes and colours , and the hills drew nearer than usual , with every white house and spire distinct on their intense blue . A fragrance of vegetation came and went on the breeze ; perhaps it was the breath of dying Nature , but it pleased the lungs with its exciting draught . “
41502	41506	41499	41499	my	0	” said Elinor ; “
41518	41519	41499	41499	my	0	” “
41526	41532	41534	41534	you	701	” said Leslie , smiling . “
41543	41547	41534	41534	you	701	” said Elinor . “
41567	41568	41534	41534	you	701	” “
41575	41579	41571	41571	I	0	” said Elinor ; “
41609	41610	41603	41603	you	701	” “
41624	41628	41619	41619	you	701	” said Leslie . “
41644	41645	41646	41646	I	0	” “
41648	41652	41646	41646	I	0	” said Elinor , “
41669	41670	41646	41646	I	0	” “
41675	41679	41646	41646	I	0	” said Leslie ; “
41720	41721	41717	41717	you	701	” “
41724	41737	41717	41717	you	701	” said Elinor , her calm , maidenly face looking straight forward ; “
41828	42155	41819	41819	I	0	” Leslie was silent . It was a new , strange pleasure to hear the meditations of that innocent heart . He believed at that hour what so very few men have the enjoyment of believing , the purity and guilelessness there can be , and is , in many young girls . His pleasure was like that of a man who gets sight of an unsunned treasure , which the earthly air and light he lets in will soon crumble away ; but which is there and has been there in perfection , for all the time before he discovered it . The loveliness of the day , the accidents of the scene gave scope to the easy happiness they were enjoying . It grew hot , and Elinor untied her bonnet in the shade , and Leslie took it from her to carry , maltreating the ribbons as he talked and walked , and then laughing with Elinor at his male ignorance of their nature and wants . They came to a steep slope , and beginning to move quicker and quicker down it , ended by running at the top of Elinor ’s speed , so that laughing , and the blood mounting in her cool cheek , she came to the bottom holding tight by Leslie ’s arm , while he kept her safely on her feet , and laughed with her at nothing but their own spirits , and their own active frames . There , as they coasted along a high bank with an irregular hedge on the crest , Elinor ’s eye was caught by something hounding about in the fern , and in a moment they saw it was a leveret which seemed at play so near them . Elinor paused to look , but Leslie saw how it was , and said it was caught in a noose , and the string was tightening round its neck . “
42164	42168	41819	41819	I	0	” said Elinor ; “
42178	42213	41819	41819	I	0	” Leslie , to obey Elinor , went up the bank and tried to lay hold of the leveret , which , half dead as it was , still sprang about to avoid him . “
42218	42228	41819	41819	I	0	” cried Elinor , the tears almost running over ; “
42235	42392	41819	41819	I	0	” and she also scrambled up , and helped Leslie to try to lay hold of it . At last they succeeded . Then Leslie , with one hand upon the suffocated little beast , searched his waistcoat pocket for a knife , and gave it to Elinor to open , and to insinuate it between the leveret ’s neck and the string in order to set it free . He watched her earnest face , all given over to pity and interest ; her fear to give pain , her resolution to venture it , her disgust at suffering inflicted ; and she , thinking of nothing but the leveret , most delicately , most skilfully got in the knife , and drawing the sharp edge across the string released it . The poor leveret , under the sudden revulsion of blood to its natural course , lost all active power , and lay motionless . “
42401	42461	42393	42394	Poor brute	708	” said Leslie , putting it on the grass ; but Elinor was not so indifferent . She raised its head upon a little tussock , stroked it gently , pitied it , while her lover stood by smiling at the pretty picture ; and at last the leveret began to move , and Elinor was relieved and delighted . “
42470	42513	42464	42464	I	0	” she said , breaking off a great burdock leaf , and placing the little body upon it ; then carefully set it on her arms , and Leslie held her by the elbow , to get her safely down the bank . “
42525	42544	42518	42518	they	710	” said Elinor , pleased like a fresh child with the imaginary details of the leveret ’s life ; “
42563	42564	42567	42567	I	0	” “
42570	42574	42567	42567	I	0	” said Leslie ; “
42596	42597	42567	42567	I	0	” “
42606	42610	42599	42599	you	0	” said Elinor . “
42629	42630	42622	42623	Miss Chanson	29	” “
42640	42641	42622	42623	Miss Chanson	29	” “
42680	42689	42693	42693	you	0	” Elinor looked at Leslie , and smiled . “
42721	42722	42693	42693	you	0	” “
42730	42788	42693	42693	you	0	” said Leslie . At this moment the leveret , which had recovered its senses , but kept the recovery to itself watching its opportunity , made so sudden a spring , that before Elinor could utter the little cry its movement provoked , it was out of her arms , and scudding away to the copse . “
42792	42805	42693	42693	you	0	” said Elinor , looking at her empty leaf . Leslie laughed . “
42823	42964	42809	42809	I	0	” said he . And thus they walked , by the hedgerow sides of the corn fields , across banky meadows cropped by sheep , along woodland paths , which descended to the brook courses ; where they were crossed by gray large stepping‐stones ; within the edges of the wood , where with trees for a natural colonnade , they looked out upon the silent , sunny country ; hand in hand they walked , healthy , beautiful , good . It was Adam and Eve moving through the Garden of Eden . They had scarcely met a human being , the country was thinly inhabited , and they had unconsciously sought the least frequented parts ; but some hours after they first began their walk , the forest silence was disturbed by a distant voice , uttering a loud “
42967	43118	42809	42809	I	0	” and then was fired a gun as distant , and before long both sounds came nearer ; nay , they presently saw a towering pheasant hit by the discharge from the loud gun , and tumbling over and over in the air , fall with hanging wings , and dropped head , out of sight in the underwood . The next moment , Sir Peter Bicester , and a gamekeeper , and couple of beaters came in view ; he immediately left off his pursuit , and came up to Elinor , hoping he had not frightened her , and so on . Leslie had dropped Elinor ’s hand ; till she was declared his promised wife , he did not wish to claim any intimacy with her ; but Elinor was unconscious of such scruples , and replied in the simplest way to the young man ’s apologies . “
43126	43130	43135	43135	your	721	” she said , “
43147	43153	43141	43141	you	721	” And she moved on . “
43162	43167	43160	43160	Leslie	24	” said Sir Peter . “
43189	43190	43181	43181	I	0	” “
43198	43203	43181	43181	I	0	” said Sir Peter . “
43213	43250	43181	43181	I	0	” answered Leslie , and followed Elinor , whom he speedily overtook . THAT evening , Sir Peter knocked at the door of his cousin ’s sitting‐room , when he came in an hour before dinner . “
43259	43263	43265	43265	me	0	” he asked ; “
43280	43281	43265	43265	me	0	” “
43288	43308	43265	43265	me	0	” said Laura , ringing the bell at the same time , and ordering tea for him and her . “
43316	43317	43313	43313	you	722	” “
43325	43330	43313	43313	you	722	” said Sir Peter ; “

43616	43647	43612	43612	he	680	” said Laura , struggling mentally against the doom , as one does bodily against the great weight that is pressing the lungs together , so as to stop breath . “
43675	43676	43666	43666	her	110	” “

43696	43748	43749	43749	I	0	” said Sir Peter , crossing the forefingers of his two hands , playfully , yet in his heart looking seriously to such an appeal as safe to procure him the truth . Laura did not think nor hesitate for a moment . She laid her hand on his crossed fingers — “
43752	43778	43749	43749	I	0	” she said . She hated her cousin for making her do this , but she had no doubt , nevertheless , about doing it . “
43811	43812	43805	43805	I	0	” “
43821	43825	43805	43805	I	0	” said Laura , “

43891	43892	43880	43880	she	735	” “
43899	43900	43880	43880	she	735	” “

43932	43936	43925	43925	He	24	” said Laura . “
43994	43995	43988	43988	Lycurgus	70	” “
44003	44016	43997	43997	I	0	” said Laura , peevishly , then correcting herself , she added , “
44038	44224	44225	44225	I	0	” Sir Peter went on talking nonsense , which he much preferred to plotting against Elinor , for of that employment he was getting rather tired , and Laura was afraid to weary him entirely of the subject , for upon his co‐operation all her remaining hopes depended . She therefore treated the subject as lightly as she could , only insisting on some display of despair on his part at his approaching separation from Elinor , and contriving to amuse him with details , each of which she hoped would be a blow against the security in which she saw that Leslie was fortified . She herself conducted the assault this evening . Leslie gave her occasion ; he told her that he must very soon announce to her brother the engagement into which his ward had entered ; and Laura , now thoroughly on her guard assented , proposing that the end of the week should be the time chosen . Leslie agreed , and Laura had gained one point , for did not the Thursday of Sir Peter ’s departure come between ? “
44237	44243	44225	44225	I	0	” said Laura to Leslie . “
44247	44248	44225	44225	I	0	” “
44266	44267	44289	44290	King Pericles	71	” “
44277	44281	44289	44290	King Pericles	71	” said Leslie ; “
44302	44303	44289	44290	King Pericles	71	” “
44308	44314	44289	44290	King Pericles	71	” said Laura , startled . “
44343	44344	44348	44348	she	742	” “
44373	44374	44375	44375	I	0	” “
44383	44387	44375	44375	I	0	” said Leslie ; “

44412	44413	44402	44402	you	0	” “
44422	44426	44415	44415	I	0	” said Leslie . “
44439	44602	44432	44432	I	0	” said Laura . She turned away , and proposed music to one of the party , but her eyes did not fail to observe that Leslie took advantage of the opportunity to stand talking with Elinor at the open window , and she persuaded herself was asking the explanation she intended him to seek . There was some little pre‐occupation in his way of carrying on the beginning of the conversation , a shade of embarrassment , and a questioning air . Elinor coloured deeply , and hesitated to answer him , and Laura believed that the headache which she herself had ordered Elinor to remember , and the silence which she herself had ordered Elinor to keep about the stone quarry walk , were throwing the appearance of double‐dealing over the entangled girl . Leslie ’s fond look at last she could not so well interpret . She did not think he was satisfied with respect to the walk , yet “
44604	44610	44611	44611	he	746	” ( thought she ) , “
44637	44735	44631	44631	he	746	” Laura was not much out in her interpretation of Leslie ’s looks ; in fact , he was disposed to believe and to excuse in Elinor , the manœuvres which he fancied the inexperienced young girl had been led to practise before her present engagement with him ; but at all events , as things were now , he determined to put a stop to all proceedings of the kind , and would fain have warned and set Elinor on her guard , as her mother would have done , had she ever known her mother . “
44742	44746	44736	44736	Nobody	1225	” he said , “
44780	44781	44782	44783	Mr. Chanson	37	” “
44796	44800	44782	44783	Mr. Chanson	37	” said Elinor ; “

45082	45086	45077	45079	the Reverend Mother	98	” repeated Elinor ; “
45095	45096	45077	45079	the Reverend Mother	98	” “
45103	45107	45099	45099	he	760	” said Leslie ; “

45232	45245	45201	45201	I	0	” said Elinor . Leslie looked at her , and half laughed . “
45254	45258	45246	45246	You	0	” said he . “
45265	45269	45276	45276	he	37	” said Elinor ; “

45332	45333	45320	45320	you	0	” “
45338	45342	45334	45334	I	0	” said Elinor , “

45379	45380	45373	45373	I	0	” “
45389	46054	45383	45383	I	0	” said Elinor , lifting her eyes to his . He thought of the morning at breakfast , when he could not get one glimpse of those shy eyes ; and he thought also of the many things between that moment and the one in which her innocence had converted all his thoughts into pure projects like itself . In his heart he worshipped the creature who held so strong , yet so silken a dominion over him , and in his enjoyment of the prospect now before him , he instinctively tried to forget the cruel one which he had entertained and abandoned . Laura had no time to spare , or she would have let things work more gently than she could now afford . This was Saturday evening ; and the evening of Sunday she destined to commence a plot which must explode before Thursday , or all her schemes would be at fault . The course of Sunday contented her well enough . The usual duties of the day went forward , and however mechanically to Laura , there was no outward dereliction . She would have had a vague uneasiness at absenting herself from the village church , but no word that she heard there struck her as forbidding — no word she uttered there , struck her as renouncing — the secret purposes she meditated . Once , as a very young child , instructed to lay by every secular employment on the Sabbath day , it chanted that her mother , who led a usually secluded life , was invited by a very great house to very great feast on a Sunday ; and the mother went , not because she thought and explained that there was no harm in it , but because the temptation was so strong . Laura had opportunities enough to melt down the impression which this fact made on her ; nor did it , probably , in itself produce much effect , but her nature had that bias which caused it to select and feed upon this and various similar incidents which the tide of things presented to her , until at length led away by selfishness and by uncontrolled passions , she had come to be , as one may say , two Lauras , the one who professed in theory whatever was good , and the one whose actions regarded simply what was convenient . It is a very common character . This Sunday , therefore , saw her in the family pew with her guests ; saw her take the school report from the hand of the curtseying schoolmistress , and rebuke the child who was shown up for inattention . She let the horses and servants rest to‐day , and proposed merely a walk by way of amusement . Before she could prevent him , Leslie drew Elinor away , and by the side of the waterfall and up the banks of the brook , they passed the afternoon hours . Laura had got a present for her cousin Peter , a travelling bag , fitted in the smallest compass with the most numerous articles , and called him to her sitting‐room to give it . Sir Peter was rather melancholy and sentimental . He was going to the other side of the world , and was pleased to do so , and yet it touched him to feel that nobody was much interested in his departure except himself ; his place would close over at once , and it was he only who cared or reflected that he was going . Laura ’s care , therefore , to procure a present for him , gave him pleasure . He employed himself in examining and admiring every article , and in obtaining from Laura a few words in her own hand , declaring herself the giver of the bag , and the well‐wishing cousin of the recipient . “
46068	46073	46066	46066	you	771	” said Sir Peter ; “
46092	46093	46097	46097	they	773	” “

46268	46281	46265	46265	You	771	” said Sir Peter , starting up , and forgetting his melancholy ; “

46404	46412	46390	46390	you	0	” said Sir Peter , smiling gaily . “

46665	46734	46651	46651	he	56	” said Laura . Dinner was not over till the evening was dark , for October was at the end of its first week . The rooms were bright with lamps and candles , but the windows were open to the shadowy scene without , for the weather was very hot , even as though summer were abroad masquerading in the splendidly coloured robes of the aged year . “
46742	46759	46651	46651	he	56	” said Laura to Elinor , who was the only lady beside herself of the party ; “
46774	46809	46810	46810	I	0	” They went together along the garden paths , and reached the avenue of great Scotch firs which terminated it , and which at its other extremity had a wicket opening into the park . “
46813	46817	46810	46810	I	0	” said Laura , “
46835	46836	46829	46829	you	792	” “

46897	46901	46902	46903	poor woman	793	” said Laura ; “
46938	46955	46929	46929	he	482	” Elinor was silent ; whatever she might say she felt would bring down a rebuke . “
46962	46969	46960	46960	Elinor	21	” said Laura , at last . “
46972	46996	46960	46960	Elinor	21	” said Elinor , who was accustomed at the convent to wait on the sick , and to be employed about their errands . “
47000	47001	46998	46998	I	0	” “
47089	47140	47142	47142	God	75	” Elinor did all she was bid , and Laura , when she was disappearing like a white spirit down the gloomy avenue , turned hastily and ran to the house , where she gave thanks ( like Shylock when his enemies ’ ships are lost , and he says , “
47148	47264	47146	47146	God	75	” ) to see that the time for evening Sunday prayers was not more than a quarter of an hour distant , at which epoch of the evening the absence of any member of the party must become conspicuous . Both Leslie and Sir Peter glanced round the room as soon as they came in , for Elinor . Both looked at Laura to account for her absence . A faint smile , and a slight elevation of her eyebrows informed the latter that Elinor would be found where he expected , and Sir Peter vanished to keep the imaginary rendezvous on his side . Leslie asked in a low voice , where was Elinor . “
47270	47277	47267	47267	she	800	” said Laura , looking round ; “
47303	47465	47293	47293	she	800	” Leslie was obliged to content himself ; and taking up a book , sat watching the door which , every time it opened drew his eager eyes , till the appearance of some uninteresting figure caused them to be impatiently cast down again . Laura ’s attention went nervously to the clock , which ticked on so composedly , and would not hasten towards half‐past nine . Nor even when the half‐hour had leisurely lifted up its voice twice , to denote that it was come , did the outer bell sound for prayers , till another full minute had gone by ; and yet further , several seconds , which seemed like hours ( as they do to a man under the surgeon ’s hands , or hanging on the edge of a precipice while relief is coming ) , passed by , before the butler threw open the door , and announced , after the manner of butlers , “
47470	47572	47293	47293	she	800	” Laura rose at once , and with a bland smile , walked alone out of the room followed by her brother , by Leslie , and by the few men who were guests in the house . Nothing could have answered better , for as they crossed the ante‐room , which opened on the garden , Elinor came hastily in , the veil on her head , and Sir Peter following closely . Laura saw Leslie ’s start of displeased surprise ; he went to her and offered his arm , regardless who observed him , or what they thought . “
47578	47588	47589	47590	Miss Chanson	29	” he said , in a very low voice . “
47603	47631	47589	47590	Miss Chanson	29	” Leslie had just heard that Miss Chanson bad been alone in the garden , and that Elinor had said she was going to her own room . “
47638	47642	47643	47643	I	0	” said Leslie . “
47649	47653	47654	47654	he	804	” said Elinor ; “
47663	47664	47654	47654	he	804	” “
47678	47679	47674	47674	You	802	” “
47688	47689	47684	47684	I	0	” “
47698	47868	47869	47869	She	806	” They had now crossed the hall and entered the parlour where the servants were assembled . The necessary outer decorum prevailed , but stormy was Leslie ’s bosom , sad and frightened was Elinor ’s , while holy words and pious attitudes alone appeared to the public ear and eye . Laura hastened Elinor away with her after prayers , saying that they must be punctual to‐morrow at breakfast in order to be ready for an expedition which she had arranged , and however early it was they would now go to bed to prepare for it . Leslie was so much in love that he did not venture on being offended with Elinor ; he no longer assumed an authoritative manner with her , that was too paternal , too like a guardian , but he had a grieved look and way towards her , wholly natural and unpremeditated , which brought the tears into her eyes . He saw them , and they atoned for everything . “
47873	47879	47880	47880	she	806	” he said to himself ; “
47964	48219	47939	47939	she	806	” He stamped the unoffending boards of his room as he came to this conclusion , and walked up and down till he reflected there was such a thing as going to bed . And now came Monday , the day on which the drawing , the needlework , the gardening , the professional duties , if there be any , or the gun and the dogs , the fishing rod and ride if there be none , are resumed after one day ’s suspension . There has been the village church changing the disposal of the morning and afternoon from the six days ’ course ; there has been , perhaps , a different style of books read , an abstinence from some favourite employment , and , at all events , there has been the sight of the poor man ’s holiday ; twenty‐four hours , in short , in some way different from other similar periods , and a consequent mark left upon Time . Laura awaking , saw before her three wretched days , in which she had to fight against the natural order of things in order to bring about a base purpose of her own ; a purpose liable in a high degree to failure , she was disinclined to get up and do this iniquitous battle , although it was not that the iniquity struck her , but her own hard fate in being unable to obtain the object necessary to her happiness without such a struggle . “
48225	48237	47939	47939	she	806	” thus her thoughts came over her , but not worded ; “
48404	48705	48369	48369	he	811	” Laura sprang out of bed and took up her self‐imposed burthen . How carefully were all the minute cares of her person attended to , and how mechanically ; but as for her mind , its habits were not those which led her to be true with herself ; hence all was slurred and burred within , and she had a most imperfect view of what she herself was doing . But at half‐past nine she descended clean as a white pebble from a running brook , neat as a rose‐bud still bound by its unfolding calyx ; agreeable , attentive , handsome ; but within , there was a heart constantly conscious in its way of beating that something was wrong ; there was a dry mouth which disliked the business of talking , and hated that of eating ; there was the sense of hearing strained to catch one voice , and rebelling because that voice was not addressed to her . There was fear over all , that some of the many words might be said which would reveal those secrets which lay so near the surface , and which any chance might lay bare from the covering she was able to draw over them . Chance did not show itself favourable to‐day ; for her plan had been to keep the lovers apart by dividing the party between carriage and horseback , and to visit a show place in the neighbourhood , of which the possessors were friends of hers , and their society and chaperonage round their house and garden , would prevent the formation of tête‐à‐têtes . But before breakfast was over , the clouds let fall their long‐threatening torrents , and in a very short time Mr. Chanson declared the expedition impossible . “
48720	48724	48369	48369	he	811	” said he ; “
48800	48801	48802	48802	I	0	” “
48812	48816	48817	48817	Elinor	21	” said Laura ; “
48823	48824	48817	48817	Elinor	21	” “
48829	48833	48817	48817	Elinor	21	” said Elinor . “
48843	48858	48834	48834	You	817	” said Laura , availing herself of the shot which accident opened to her . “
48861	48865	48834	48834	You	817	” said Elinor . “
48871	48880	48881	48881	I	0	” asked Leslie , in a low voice . “
48885	48895	48881	48881	I	0	” said Elinor , in a voice still lower ; “
48913	48914	48900	48900	I	0	” “
48927	48931	48934	48934	she	1508	” said Leslie . “
48936	48940	48934	48934	she	1508	” said Elinor ; “
48955	48956	48941	48941	I	0	” “
48959	49025	48941	48941	I	0	” thought Leslie . Evening came , and with it a change in the weather . Before setting , the sun shone brightly out , and it left the autumnal garden in a gentle haze of warm air , where the smell of the fresh earth and the excited flowers , and the air renovated with moisture , flattered every sense of eye and ear . “
49029	49048	48941	48941	I	0	” said Laura , when she and Elinor stood again outside the window which opened on the walk ; “
49060	49082	49083	49083	Elinor	21	” They did so , and at the end of that time , Laura said she must return to the house . “
49151	49152	49153	49153	I	0	” “
49160	49165	49153	49153	I	0	” said Elinor . ; “

49178	49188	49153	49153	I	0	” said Laura , turning full round upon her . “
49199	49205	49189	49190	Sir Peter	56	” Laura burst into laughter . “
49224	49225	49212	49212	himself	56	” “
49231	49235	49226	49226	I	0	” said Elinor . “

49362	49366	49354	49354	you	21	” said Elinor , “
49379	49380	49371	49372	Mr. Leslie	24	” “
49428	49437	49424	49426	a good child	832	” Elinor stood with tears in her eyes . “
49440	49452	49453	49453	I	0	” she said , when Laura scornfully waited for an answer ; “
49463	49464	49453	49453	I	0	” “
49525	49556	49507	49507	he	1160	” Elinor stood silent : her colour rose under the hard words and fearful prophecy , but she did not credit it , and yet would not contradict the utterer . “
49563	49569	49507	49507	he	1160	” said Miss Chan‐ son , “
49635	49636	49627	49627	Men	1230	” “
49640	49646	49627	49627	Men	1230	” said Elinor , smiling , “
49654	49655	49651	49651	you	21	” “
49664	49671	49651	49651	you	21	” said Laura , smiling also , “
49678	49684	49685	49685	You	21	” Elinor shook her head . “
49689	49690	49691	49691	I	0	” “
49695	49696	49704	49704	you	21	” “

49721	49722	49704	49704	you	21	” “
49770	49822	49764	49764	you	21	” Laura turned her back , and set out hastily ; but in a few seconds she stopped , and looked back , she had expected that the gentle girl would have run after her , but there was Elinor , standing quite still , watching her . Laura ran back — “
49869	49870	49871	49871	I	0	” “
49879	49883	49871	49871	I	0	” said Elinor . “
49891	49905	49885	49885	you	21	” said Laura , commanding her voice to the lowest and calmest tone . “
49916	49917	49907	49907	you	21	” “
49927	49931	49932	49932	I	0	” said Elinor , “
49940	50036	50037	50037	She	850	” and she turned away , and went straight into the house , and upstairs , while Laura dashed the tears of passion from her eyes , and inveighed against the cruelty of the young girl , for triumphing in her victory over the lover of her benefactress . When she reached the drawing‐room it was still empty . She opened a book of drawings on the table , and composed her agitated frame . A few minutes brought in her brother and his guests , and then the first inquiry was for Miss Ladylift . “
50047	50234	50037	50037	She	850	” said Miss Chanson , demurely . Sir Peter instantly glanced at his cousin , and smiled . Mr. Leslie caught the smile , and his eye turned in the same moment upon Laura , but she was looking straight forward , as innocent as a bird . He perceived , however , that young Bicester was swallowing a scalding cup of coffee , and that lounging apparently from one window to another , he silently opened the door , and disappeared . Leslie , with no attempt at mystery , went out directly after . The evening was growing very dusky , but he saw the man he deemed his rival , entering the avenue , and hastily followed him . Sir Peter was alone ; and that he was alone , surprised Sir Peter . But that the person who joined him should be Leslie , thoroughly annoyed him , and Leslie on his part was equally angry at finding the young soldier thus apparently awaiting a rendezvous . The one overtook the other , and they walked together a few yards in silence . “
50242	50250	50254	50254	you	851	” said Sir Peter , at last . “
50256	50257	50037	50037	She	850	” “
50260	50272	50037	50037	She	850	” Again there was silence ; then Sir Peter began again . “
50282	50283	50286	50286	you	851	” “
50288	50289	50286	50286	you	851	” “
50292	50514	50286	50286	you	851	” Sir Peter shook the ashes from his cigar bitterly , and then turned suddenly , and walked in the opposite direction . Leslie , who seldom smoked , took out a cigar , in order to give himself some reason for being here , and puffing with undue vigour , excited a great smoke , and marched to the end of the avenue ; here he turned , and about mid‐way , the two young men met , and crossed each other , each sending out a large gale of tobacco , and looking as happy as he could . How long this was to go on , Leslie did not like to conjecture but at all events he did not intend to leave the ground while his rival occupied it , even though they should walk thus till morning . Sir Peter it seemed was not so persevering , for before they came across each other a third time , he stepped on one side of the path , and left the avenue by a wicket which led by a back way to the house . Leslie immediately stood still and flung his cigar as far as its weight would carry it , and then collected his thoughts with more form than the presence of Sir Peter had allowed . “
50525	50531	50533	50533	he	853	” he said to himself ; “
50641	50776	50777	50777	I	0	” Thus he stormed within , standing beside one of the stern fir‐stems , which threw a steadfast shadow on the turf from its branches between the moonlight and the ground . Nearly half an hour passed , in which time Sir Peter felt fully persuaded that his rival must have been tired of his suspicion , and have left the avenue . He himself had been to the saloon , where still the fair Elinor was not , and with some hope , rekindled from the malicious eyes of Laura , he returned again to try his fortune . Slowly he paced down the avenue , and failed to perceive the dark figure beneath the fir‐tree . As he came on , it advanced suddenly from the shadow . Sir Peter started slightly . “
50781	50785	50777	50777	I	0	” said he . “
50789	50793	50787	50787	you	0	” said Leslie . “
50796	50828	50787	50787	you	0	” said Sir Peter , and again they passed each other , and Sir Peter proceeding to the end of the avenue , opened the gate , and went finally out . “
50837	50937	50938	50938	She	861	” said the young man , as he returned home . Next morning , Tuesday , Leslie and Miss Chanson were walking together through the garden to the conservatory . Elinor looking from her window saw them , and was pleased that her angry guardianess should be in company with one who she felt would speak even better of her than she deserved . So warbling some low notes with her melodious throat , she turned away to put in order part of her simple wardrobe , with skilful fingers well versed in the arts of hemming and darning . “
50942	50950	50938	50938	She	861	” said Leslie , to Miss Chanson , “
50961	50984	50938	50938	She	861	” Laura started , not knowing how much of their interview had been repeated , and looked Leslie inquiringly in the face . “
50989	50996	50938	50938	She	861	” she began , and paused . “
51002	51006	50938	50938	She	861	” said Leslie , “
51025	51026	51008	51008	you	862	” “
51033	51042	51029	51029	you	0	” said Laura , quite at ease again ; “
51048	51049	51029	51029	you	0	” “
51062	51066	51029	51029	you	0	” said Leslie ; “
51087	51088	51073	51073	you	862	” “
51096	51106	51107	51107	I	0	” said Laura , candidly . Leslie was silent . “
51113	51120	51107	51107	I	0	” said Laura , at last , “
51130	51131	51122	51122	I	0	” “
51140	51144	51122	51122	I	0	” said Leslie , “
51179	51180	51169	51169	she	861	” “
51185	51189	51169	51169	she	861	” said Laura , “
51205	51211	51212	51212	She	861	” Leslie again was silent . “
51216	51223	51212	51212	She	861	” said Leslie , at last , “
51260	51261	51246	51246	she	861	” “
51267	51289	51291	51291	she	861	” said Laura , very quickly ; then as if frightened at what she herself had said , she added hastily , “
51301	51302	51291	51291	she	861	” “
51306	51312	51313	51313	she	861	” said Leslie , sighing , “
51358	52073	51341	51341	I	0	” It was now Laura who was silent . To hear a purpose announced which directly contradicts the secret object of one ’s endeavours and desires , is like a blow struck right upon the heart . Why can not the blinded eye of our companion see and choose the path which we perceive so plainly is the one fit for him ? Leslie was out of spirits , and when he had gone through the flowers of the conservatory mechanically with Laura and the gardener , he walked back with her , till they came in sight of the house again , and then turned into the park , and wandered away alone , whither he did not care . Laura proposed twenty things in order to entangle Elinor with her cousin , but was baffled in all . Elinor would not take a lesson in billiards , would not learn to sit the pony , would not teach Sir Peter a duet , would not lend him a book of her own — she declined all , even before they were fully proposed ; and at last , upon the arrival of some morning visitors , attached herself to the mother of the party , who did not choose to walk far , and never left her side the rest of the morning . Laura did not venture upon any scheme for the evening , but she saw with bitter pleasure , that Leslie , by seeming accident sat by another than Elinor at dinner , and that when they were all assembled in the drawing‐room , he and Elinor seemed to want subjects of conversation , and were grave and embarrassed in place of that joyful glee which Leslie ’s face had so often assumed , to Laura ’s anguish , when listening to , and talking with Elinor . Wednesday was come , and now Laura had her last blow to strike , the one that must undo her if it did not succeed . There was a feeling in the house about seeing the last of Sir Peter , since after to‐day , he could be seen and heard no more . He was not to go shooting alone , nor to take a solitary gallop ; he was to walk with Laura and the rest , he was to visit the stables with Mr. Chanson . Even if those who were not to be travellers had something better to do , there would be time for that to‐morrow , when there would be no more time available for Sir Peter . Mr. Chanson , Leslie , and Sir Peter , were all to set out early on the morrow . They were to drive together to the neighbouring town , and there to separate , the two first to pursue their way to Mr. Chanson ’s property , and the young soldier to go on to London where his final preparations would be made . Leslie , in a doubtful state of mind , was looking out for offence and cause of unhappiness ; Elinor , in an humble one , was unconsciously giving it . She was accustomed to the discipline of a conventual school education , and had learned a degree of patience , which made her take Leslie ’s absence as an unavoidable trouble , of which she must not complain . He also had been accustomed to the natural teaching of school , but had acquired a different lesson , for his spirit had been one of those which make others yield to them , and had gratified every wish as it arose . Her meekness , therefore , in resigning him for a certain number of days seemed indifference in his eyes , mystified as he was by Laura ; and though he loved her the more anxiously for her coldness , he imagined that it gave him greater reason to suspect that another occupied part of his place in her heart . Elinor felt there was something wrong , though she knew not what , and Leslie was conscious of a restraint , unlike those happy days — the few days — when he and she wandered among the fields and woods . “
52084	52105	52106	52106	I	0	” said Sir Peter , as he and Laura sat together an hour before dinner , in her own apartment . “
52121	52122	52115	52115	I	0	” “
52134	52138	52127	52127	you	0	” said Laura . “
52183	52184	52185	52185	She	782	” “
52192	52196	52197	52197	he	24	” said Laura ; “
52211	52212	52203	52203	she	782	” “
52219	52220	52214	52214	he	24	” “
52239	52240	52241	52241	You	0	” “
52252	52253	52254	52254	Women	1158	” “
52306	52307	52259	52259	you	0	” “
52316	52317	52259	52259	you	0	” “
52338	52339	52330	52330	I	0	” “
52346	52347	52330	52330	I	0	” “
52369	52370	52364	52364	she	782	” “
52398	52399	52422	52422	him	877	” “
52407	52411	52412	52412	I	0	” said Laura . “
52452	52758	52447	52447	her	1234	” Laura now took her portfolio on her knees , drew the little writing table close , and laughing and coquetting , composed a note which amused Sir Peter , and which he copied at Laura ’s side , and promised to remit to Elinor . Laura agreed that he should do so , but just as he was leaving the room , recalled him , and told him to trust it to her care , for that she could manage it much better than he . Sir Peter tossed her the note , which she caught in a very pretty attitude , and kissed the tips of her fingers to him as he paused at the door , to give her a last look . It was ten o’clock that night when a woman wrapped over her head and whole figure in a cloak , brushed by Sir Peter , as he walked in the avenue , and as she passed thrust a note into his hand . He caught the hand that gave it , but it told nothing except that it was enveloped in a glove . Rather than be detained by him , the hand slipped out of the glove , and the figure darted into the thick shade , and disappeared . The glove was merely a concealment for the hand , for it had plainly been held loosely , as a measure prepared beforehand to avoid detention ; but it was a woman ’s glove , of delicate size , and was finished with a plaited ribbon , such as Elinor frequently employed herself in fashioning . Sir Peter laughed as he recognised it , and placing it in his bosom , proceeded by the light of the moon to decipher , though with great difficulty , these words — “
52774	53311	52772	52772	LADYLIFT	21	” Poor Elinor ’s ill starred billet ! SEE that man walking up and down his room all night , except when at times he flung himself on the sofa , burying his head in his clenched hands . The little shred of paper lay sometimes on the table , sometimes on the floor , trampled on , crumpled , torn ; again spread out , and read with unabating fury . Beside it lay the glove , which together with the note had been brought to him by Laura , and which with scarce any words she pressed upon him as the tokens of Elinor ’s falsity . He saw them and believed ; they seemed to him to indicate that the meetings between Elinor and the young soldier , which he had persuaded himself were the effects of accident , or of mere momentary thoughtlessness , were parts of a long‐continued understanding between them , and that to Elinor they had become so habitual as to make an apology necessary , when she was unable to keep the appointment . How could Leslie doubt ? there was her handwriting , there was the glove of her fine hand — false hand , false heart!—her he had trusted then in vain ! the innocence by which he had remodelled his own intentions , did not exist . Laura had stabbed him with this poisoned dagger , and left it to work out her own ends ; and frantic indeed was the effect of the wound she had inflicted . As soon as day dawned , Leslie left the house , and continued his agitated walk up and down the garden where he knew , by many a morning ’s experience , it was Elinor ’s practise to walk before the breakfast hour , and where of late he had usually joined her . The cold October air chilled his frame , the heavy rime , almost frost , weighed down the remaining flowers and the dripping grass ; the sun , long hidden after it had left the horizon , struggled with the mist that filled the whole atmosphere . It was late before the day became as light as the hour warranted ; and the savage impatience of Leslie grew almost to delirium . At last , a window which opened to the ground from one of the sitting‐rooms was heard to rise , he stood still , partly hidden by the trunk of a cedar , and saw shrouded in a gray cloak , and a hood concealing her face , Elinor step into the garden , and move along the walk to his place . He instantly came forward , and silently seizing her arm , saying no word , answering no look , dragged her forward with a hand which she felt violently trembling , nor stopped till they were in the wood together , deeply hidden , as the words they had to say together required hiding . Then letting go her arm from one hand , and opening the other , he showed her the little note and the glove , which it had clenched as they came along . “
53315	53327	52772	52772	LADYLIFT	21	” he said , fixing his bloodshot eyes on her face . “
53339	53366	53335	53335	I	0	” said Elinor , holding out her hand for it , and looking up at Leslie , perplexed , whether to smile or yield to terror . “
53377	53381	53383	53383	me	0	” said Leslie ; “
53390	53391	53383	53383	me	0	” “
53397	53409	53394	53394	I	0	” said Elinor , frightened , and with a trembling voice . “
53445	53471	53472	53472	Leslie	24	” Elinor looked at the little paper in his fierce hand , and recognised the first words of the billet she had written months before . “
53474	53478	53472	53472	Leslie	24	” she said , “
53494	53495	53486	53486	I	0	” “
53498	53502	53503	53503	you	879	” cried Leslie , “
53530	53531	53527	53527	your	879	” “
53534	53569	53570	53570	Devil	79	” said Elinor , earnestly looking in his face , and saying the one true word , for she had nothing else her nature permitted her to say . Then his fury burst out — “
53576	53580	53574	53574	woman	1629	” cried he . “
53621	53626	53635	53635	you	879	” Elinor interrupted him . “
53644	53645	53635	53635	you	879	” “
53733	53734	53725	53725	I	0	” “
53763	53764	53761	53761	you	24	” “
53770	53774	53761	53761	you	24	” cried Leslie , “
53820	53821	53822	53822	Leslie	24	” “
53824	54462	53822	53822	Leslie	24	” cried Elinor , laying her hand upon his arm . He caught hold of her hand , and crushed it in his , like one whose nerves have escaped control , and are contracting upon the object that excites them with mechanical fury ; then his hold relaxing , he flung her hand away , and uttering a groan , which at the same time he struggled to repress , lie turned , and rushed from her sight . Elinor was changed to stone , by all that the few minutes just passed contained ; she gazed on the blank space where Leslie had been , and had said such killing words ; she thought of herself , entering the garden but now , about , as she believed , to converse with her lover , and part from him for a few days , soon never to part again ; and could by no means realise that his love had turned to fury , that he had said he was about to leave her for ever . Her mind and body seemed paralyzed , and when at last she recovered strength of both , enough to move from the place where she was , she did but return with benumbed steps to her own room , and there sinking upon the floor , lay crushed and bowed together , sobbing as though her comfortless heart must break . The guilty cause of all this woe , once more glittering in outside show , like some splendid serpent , was descending in apparent peace to the morning meal ; but her bosom also burned with anxiety , and she trembled internally at the thought of what aspects she might meet . Might she not there see , perhaps , Leslie and Elinor , with all explained between them , and united for ever against her . Might she not see Leslie frowning and despising her , Elinor sheltered by him against all future malice , or should she see them alienated from each other , and she herself successful . She opened the breakfast‐room door , with a hesitation unseen on her serene face , and glanced round ; but her conjectures were all wrong , for although all else were assembled , the two were not there . Again her heart bounded with fear , that they might be together , too angry to keep up any appearance of good will with her ; and after enduring the doubt and anxiety for a few decent minutes , she affected to be anxious what could have become of Elinor , and left the room to look for her . When she beheld the young girl , she knew that her artifices had succeeded , and triumph filled her heart . Elinor , abandoned by what was all the world to her , and terrified at her own solitude , no sooner saw a familiar face , than she rose and flung herself on Laura ’s shoulder , straining her in her embrace with inarticulate mourning . Laura thought of her own fine lace and muslin , which Elinor was deranging ; and raising her , so as to stand free of the sorrowing girl , asked her , with a voice as kindly as she could make it , the cause of her distress . Elinor ’s explanation would hardly have made anything clear , had not Laura possessed already a more perfect knowledge of the circumstances than she could receive . The single point she cared about was , what had become of Leslie , and Elinor could only repeat that he had flung her off , and rushed away through the thick wood , where she soon had lost that last sight of him . “
54466	54470	53822	53822	Leslie	24	” said Laura ; “
54488	54489	54484	54484	you	889	” “
54506	54507	54513	54513	he	890	” “
54551	54552	54553	54553	I	0	” “
54561	54565	54557	54557	I	0	” said Elinor . “
54626	54814	54617	54617	I	0	” And Laura departed , going down stairs elastically , and filled with the image of her rival , whom she had left behind humiliated , robbed of her beauty by tears , and abandoned by the man who once abandoned Laura for her . She made the excuse of headache , and having over‐walked herself , about Elinor , and now if Leslie had but come in , would have been perfectly happy ; but his absence raised new fears in her heart , that in giving up one , he would not renew his allegiance to the other , nay , might commit some rash act , her fear and her love began to dread what . Breakfast was nearly over when a note was brought to her brother at the other end of the table ; he opened and read it to himself , and Laura all the time was obliged to keep smiling at her cousin , who sat beside her , for his last breakfast in her society , but whose words at this time conveyed no meaning to her at all . “
54823	54830	54831	54831	you	895	” she said , at last ; “
54835	54836	54831	54831	you	895	” “
54841	54845	54846	54846	he	24	” said he ; “
54877	54878	54874	54875	any messenger	898	” “
54883	54894	54874	54875	any messenger	898	” said the servant , who was waiting at breakfast . “
54901	54906	54897	54898	Mr. Leslie	24	” said Mr. Chanson . “
54914	54915	54910	54910	I	0	” “
54926	54931	54934	54934	he	24	” Nothing was gone . “
54941	54946	54934	54934	he	24	” said Mr. Chanson ; “
54977	54978	54974	54974	I	0	” “
54983	54987	54992	54992	he	24	” said Laura ; “
55009	55010	54992	54992	he	24	” “
55018	55022	55012	55012	he	24	” said another . “
55032	55238	55239	55239	My	0	” said a third ; but both Mr. Chanson and Sir Peter looked at Laura , suspecting a quarrel between her and Leslie . She neither said nor looked any answer , but she was officious and obliging in promoting the arrangements of the party , and when she fancied her brother still hesitated about his journey in consequence of Leslie ’s secession , she exerted herself to persuade her cousin to accompany him , and demonstrated that with a little extra , exertion he might both perform this friendly office by Mr. Chanson , and also get through his business in London before the time came for the sailing of the ship . Sir Peter , for her sake , at last consented . Mr. Chanson was satisfied to exchange Leslie for him , and all seemed arranged to the general satisfaction . But five minutes before the time of departure , Laura , watching her opportunity , followed her brother into his study , where he was giving his last directions to a servant , and sending the man from the room , suddenly put her arms round her brother ’s neck and appeared to be stifling the sobs which stopped her utterance . “
55268	55269	55271	55271	he	906	” “
55285	55286	55282	55282	him	906	” “
55307	55308	55297	55297	I	0	” “
55356	55357	55358	55358	You	24	” “
55397	55398	55394	55394	you	24	” “
55402	55407	55394	55394	you	24	” said Laura impetuously , “
55415	55416	55411	55413	a betrothed woman	909	” “
55421	55427	55411	55413	a betrothed woman	909	” said her brother seriously ; “
55460	55478	55483	55483	Lawrence	51	” But Laura sank almost on her knees , her arms clasping her brother all the time . “
55584	55585	55586	55586	I	0	” “
55598	55599	55588	55588	you	0	” “
55620	55621	55613	55613	I	0	” “
55635	55636	55613	55613	I	0	” “
55699	56123	56124	56125	Miss Chanson	29	” Real tears came into Laura ’s eyes , as though she had been spectatrix of the same scene at a play . Mr. Chanson was moved , and repeatedly pressed upon her his offers of assistance . She , however , continued steadily to refuse , and returning with him to the hall , suffered Sir Peter to think she had been reddening her eyes with sisterly weeping for him , and at last saw them all depart , and was very glad when the house was finally cleared , and she was at liberty to put the finishing stroke to her plans . LESLIE ’S anger and despair carried him to the end of three days , and when those were elapsed , the mild image of Elinor began to break through his stormy passions like present moonlight in a sky thick with black clouds . His own harshness , exercised upon so delicate a feature , shocked himself ; her fear , her courage when she laid her soft hand upon him , her utter bereavement when he left her in the deep wood alone , wounded his heart . He believed in all the faults which he had believed at that moment , but he began to think they were immeasurably punished by him ; he felt himself the greater sufferer under that punishment , and when his spirit revolted from the idea of receiving again the broken vows which she had once made him , he yet felt impelled to implore her pardon for the manner in which he had resented her perfidy . When he had persuaded himself that such was the object which made him long to see her again , he at once gave way to his desire to do so , and a very short time saw him again in the neighbourhood of Chanson Wood , haunting every spot where he could hope to meet with Elinor . But it was all in vain , the cold weather caused all the shutters to be closed with declining daylight , so that he had no such chance as the summer had afforded him of investigating the dwellers of the rooms . No old favourite haunt was visited by her footstep , no morning or evening hour brought her out to behold its beauty . Leslie wandered about for four and twenty hours , and then made his way to the house itself , and inquired for Mr. Chanson . He was not yet come home . “
56127	56201	56124	56125	Miss Chanson	29	” She was walking in the flower‐garden . He had not words to ask for Elinor , but followed the servant silently into the garden , dreading more than wishing that the two ladies might be together . But no ; Laura only was there . While the servant was within hearing , Leslie ’s tone and manner preserved their common‐place , but they were no sooner alone than he broke out eagerly , “
56208	56212	56205	56206	Miss Ladylift	21	” Laura hesitated . “
56221	56222	56215	56215	she	21	” “
56228	56229	56224	56224	you	0	” “
56245	56246	56247	56248	Mr. Leslie	24	” “
56255	56256	56257	56258	My God	919	” “
56260	56264	56257	56258	My God	919	” cried Leslie ; “
56270	56288	56265	56265	I	0	” and his wild eyes searched and commanded Laura ’s face for the fearful words he expected . “
56292	56296	56265	56265	I	0	” said Laura ; “
56328	56329	56319	56319	she	21	” “
56333	56334	56319	56319	she	21	” “
56403	56404	56430	56430	she	21	” “
56408	56428	56430	56430	she	21	” said Leslie , laying hold of Miss Chanson ’s arm , and speaking in a very low voice ; “
56439	56440	56430	56430	she	21	” “
56443	56447	56430	56430	she	21	” said Laura . “
56459	56469	56430	56430	she	21	” Laura ’s colour rose to scarlet in‐her face . “
56478	56502	56430	56430	she	21	” she said ; and in truth , Leslie had suggested an event in the plot which Laura had overlooked in contriving it . “
56511	56515	56516	56516	He	482	” cried Leslie . “
56537	56538	56539	56539	I	0	” “
56544	56561	56539	56539	I	0	” said Leslie , as if unable to argue , able only to fear and suffer . “
56584	56592	56581	56582	Miss Chanson	29	” he said , offering his hand ; “
56616	56636	56638	56638	he	482	” So saying , he turned away and walked up the garden , Laura pursuing him with stedfast eyes . “
56645	56651	56638	56638	he	482	” she said to herself ; “
56686	56723	56663	56663	he	482	” Then as she saw him ascend the steps of the terrace , her eye could not but mark that he did so with a step very unlike the decided strong movement of his general pace . “
56728	56734	56724	56724	He	482	” she said to herself ; “
56758	57228	57229	57229	You	932	” The day was by this time dark , and Laura , whose general habits were luxu‐ rious , and who was to be found on cold evenings in her lounging‐chair at the side of a bright fire , her feet upon the warm hearth , abundance of wax light on her marqueterie table , her book , her work , her dress all in keeping , on this night muffled her person in a gray cloak , and going herself to the stables , at the time of the hall supper , when she knew one lad only would be left there , caused this boy to prepare her pony carriage with uncompromising haste , and , with him to drive her , set off in cold and darkness for Cantleton , the town where Mr. Roundel lived . She had readily answered Leslie that he would return to‐morrow , her instinct being on all occasions to gain time ; but she was perfectly aware herself , that he had already been back a whole day , having in fact received from him the assurance that he had conducted Elinor to the convent whither all Laura ’s skill and power had been exerted to make her fly . She had , however , felt in a moment that she must see him before Leslie could do so , and had gained twenty‐four hours by her ready lie . It was ten o’clock before she reached the town ; she had a humiliating part to play , that she felt , but at least she would do it in a grand , unquestionable way , and would come out of the house quite beyond being assailed in person by any remarks which might be made by its indwellers when she should be gone . Besides , she had brought a sum of money , so considerable ( under the name of paying Mr. Roundel ’s expenses on his journey ) that the acceptance of it — and she was quite sure it would be accepted — would constitute an acknowledgment that further services must be rendered in return . Still , while she waited for him in his parlour , where the fire was out , and the chairs all set back against the wall , she had uneasy beatings at her heart which kept her standing ; and which she thought to subdue when he came in , by taking a seat with as much dignity as if she were in her usual position of command . She did not begin with any reference to the strange lateness of the visit , for the cause of it would soon , she knew , seem stranger than the visit itself , but without apology or explanation opened her business . “
57239	57243	57236	57237	Mr. Roundel	80	” Laura began , “
57253	57254	57236	57237	Mr. Roundel	80	” “
57266	57271	57273	57273	her	933	” began Mr. Roundel . “
57283	57287	57276	57276	I	0	” said Laura . “
57294	57295	57276	57276	I	0	” “
57306	57307	57297	57297	she	933	” “
57314	57319	57297	57297	she	933	” answered Mr. Roundel . “
57346	57347	57340	57340	anybody	262	” “

57399	57423	57377	57377	her	933	note”—Mr . Roundel looked at it , and began to understand that his answers must take some shape which he did not as yet perceive—“her
57441	57447	57438	57439	Sir Peter	56	” Mr. Roundel bowed assent . “
57475	57476	57472	57472	his	939	” “
57480	57485	57472	57472	his	939	” said Mr. Roundel . “

57507	57521	57504	57504	my	0	” said Mr. Roundel , thinking that expression would suit whatever came next . “

57533	57538	57488	57488	you	80	” said Mr. Roundel . “

57586	57587	57588	57588	I	0	” “
57592	57599	57588	57588	I	0	” answered Mr. Roundel , hastily , “

57635	57636	57632	57632	I	0	” “
57641	57646	57632	57632	I	0	” said Mr. Roundel . “

57769	57779	57762	57762	I	0	” said Laura , in the most dignified manner ; “
57820	57834	57802	57803	a friend	350	” Mr. Roundel bowed , and Laura , rising , prepared to depart . “
57847	57851	57854	57854	I	0	” said he , “
57857	57858	57854	57854	I	0	” “
57864	57871	57854	57854	I	0	” said Laura , very loftily . “
57902	57903	57904	57904	I	0	” “
57907	58026	57904	57904	I	0	” said Mr. Roundel , in a very low voice . Laura ’s eyes met his ; then , in a grand way , she requested his pardon for disturbing him at this late hour , and bidding him good‐night , sailed out of the house , Mr. Roundel following her to the pony carriage , and when she was gone shrugging his shoulders , and muttering an epithet I will not repeat . The next morning , Leslie , who had passed the night in walking about a bedroom of the inn in the town , wandered forth , dragging through the time till he might inquire when Mr. Rounder ’s return was likely to take place . “
58033	58154	58155	58159	A very fine young man	951	” the maid answered , and Leslie and he soon stood face to face . Mr. Roundel had thought over the matter , and had resolved in his own mind that the rich and powerful Miss Chanson was the injured person in this , to him , obscure history , and that , on the whole , in adopting her views of it , he should best consult his own interests , as well as her wishes . He therefore scrupled not to give Leslie the version Laura had taught him . Leslie received the story so calmly , and so much as a matter‐of‐fact , that Mr. Roundel became almost persuaded that he himself had been telling the truth . “
58161	58183	58184	58186	A fine man	952	” said he to himself , when , after thanking and wishing him good morning , Leslie disappeared down the street . “
58197	58592	57904	57904	I	0	” and with that Mr. Roundel turned back to his office . Leslie meantime reached the inn , and wished to inquire what public conveyance would first start on the road to his own place ; but the words which he found him‐ self using were not those which bore the meaning he wished to convey . He tried to frame the name of the town nearest to his own house , and spoke as slowly as he could in order to fasten the sound and the idea together ; but even then he failed , and perceiving that he had done so , he turned away by a great exertion , and forced his limbs to carry him a few step ’s ; then a great dizziness came over everything , and stumbling forward upon a seat which he just descried , he there lost consciousness of himself and everything else . He was known at the inn as the guest of Mr. Chanson , and when the doctor had seen him , and declared him dangerously ill with brain fever , and when it became apparent how desirable the presence of some responsible person might become , the landlord sent information to Chanson Wood of what had happened . Mr. Chanson had returned the evening before , and his hospitable nature led him at once to the desire of receiving his sick friend , and to have him nursed under his own roof . Laura se‐ conded him , and looked upon all as the favourable working of her fate , which was relieving her own brain from the necessity of forming further devices for the achievement of her scheme . A carriage fitted up for bearing an invalid , was despatched with a handy footman . Mr. Chanson went on horseback to the inn , and before the end of the day , the unconscious Leslie was conveyed to Chanson Wood ; and lay there helpless , like one entangled of old in the meshes of a corrupt and beautiful enchantress . The struggle between life and death was more severe and more solemn than Laura had anticipated . It lasted very long , and sometimes forced upon her the real probability of that which she had hitherto put to herself in words only , namely , that Leslie would die . “
58598	59335	57904	57904	I	0	” she said to herself , believing it , and trembling at what it implied , but she threw off the image , for it was in disagreement with all , the web she had been weaving , and whatever unfavourable report was brought her , attributed its worst gloom to mistake or ignorance , which falsely represented the real state of things . But it was very long before the demon of the fever could be cast out of Leslie ’s frame , and when at last it was expelled , it left him shattered , exhausted , and so utterly devoid of the strong sense of life he had hitherto enjoyed , that it seemed to him impossible ever to be again the free , careless , powerful being he was accustomed to be ; rather , he felt that he had only escaped the death of fever to go down more slowly , and as surely , into the grave , where all things are dark and at rest . His mind had begun under the auspices of the pure love with which Elinor had at last inspired him , to have healthier feelings than were habitual to it , of happiness and of virtue ; but the disappointment of his newly‐born faith and hope had swept away all the better feelings which grew up with them , and a more gloomy scepticism as to whatever was just and good never darkened any human bosom than that with which he got up from his long illness . It was now five months since he had fallen down unconscious in the inn at Cantleton , and been conveyed by Mr. Chanson to his own house . He had just become able to walk about , and his only desire was to go home and die there . He felt the burthen of his obligations to Mr. Chanson and Laura , and heartily wished they had left him to perish when he fell ill , and have neither tormented him with a second long process of dying , nor with a debt to them , which nothing he could do was able to pay . He made efforts beyond his present strength in order to get away the sooner , and the re‐action when he was alone piled over his spirit the mountain weight of its oppression . Laura watched him ; and it seemed to her the moment was coming when she might finish her enchantment , and prove whether the spell had been woven strong enough or not . She did not deceive herself as to the fact that he loved her not ; he was obliged , but not grateful ; he was waiting impatiently to leave her , though there was no one whose society he would seek in exchange . She could not talk so as to interest him now ; though he did his best to renew the easy gossip of bygone days . Still she had strong hold on him , and knew it . She had kept the secret of his engagement to Elinor inviolable ; and he was thankful that it had never reached Mr. Chanson . She had falsely insinuated to him that her own name had been coupled with his through the county , and that the result was injurious to her hitherto sacred reputation ; he had believed her ; and though he said to himself the fault was hers , and so must be the penalty , yet it was difficult to feel himself in no degree committed ; and , finally , his fixed expectation of death and his disenchantment with all faith in happiness , persuaded her that he would be indifferent to one scheme of life almost as much as to another . It was one early April day that she proposed to him to walk for ten minutes in the garden ; and he , eager to prove himself strong and independent again , complied . Laura knew how weak was his frame , and wondered that he could force himself to pass and repass so often up and down the dry gravel walk ; at last , she proposed to rest under a bower which kept off the active breeze of April and the bright sunbeam , and Leslie consenting , they sate down side by side . “

61019	62259	62263	62263	I	0	” Laura held out her hand , he took it ; not as a friend takes his friend ’s , not as a lover grasps that of his mistress ; but he laid his palm upon the back of her hand , and rising , led her silently towards the house . Pale , unanimated , uncongenial , these two went slowly along the walk , while the clouds of a suddenly overcast spring sky veiled the light of the day . It was like Adam and Eve wandering through the world after they were cast out of Paradise . Next day Leslie told Mr. Chanson of his engagement with Laura , and departed to his own house . All approach to tenderness on the part of Laura , he treated as if it aid not exist , and Mr. Chanson , a matter‐of‐fact man , was completely puzzled . But Laura was contented . The project which had seemed almost impossible was executed ; and when she pondered over the situation in which she found herself , she shut her eyes upon the fact that Leslie ’s misery was her own creation , and dwelt upon that of attaching herself to an un‐ happy and suffering man , till she believed that she was both generous and unselfish in so doing . Leslie meantime reached the Tower in a state of perfect exhaustion , and he thought with pleasure that the next tidings Laura would receive of her bridegroom , would be in the formal style , and on the formal deep‐edged paper of the undertaker . He sank into a stupified sleep , at the length of which the few servants in his house were too uninterested in their master to wonder , and probably did him the best service in their power by neglect . He woke and wondered that he did so , and now without rule and without physic , proceeded to live or die , just as day by day might determine . His time was passed in the most absolute solitude , so that through the twenty‐four hours he would sometimes not find occasion to utter a word ; he would lie at length on an easy chair , his gloomy eyes fixed on one spot , or wander into the air , and out of sight , nobody knew whether afar off , or just hidden by the first great tree , or projecting buttress of the old wall ; and here suffering his ideas to come or go as they would , the gloom of his mind seemed to settle thicker and thicker , as weary day was added to weary day . To himself he appeared drifting into that dark chaos , which , as he believed surrounded on all sides the brief light of conscious being ; and the impression was the stronger , because he had lost entirely the activity of those mental faculties which had hitherto been his pride and pleasure . He never read , never composed , never remembered the images with which former reading had stored his mind . Nature was uninteresting . There was sound without music ; forms , but no beauty ; actions , but no crime , and no virtue . Even the bitter past was not enough to account for his total shipwreck ; he was convinced as fully as if it had been matter‐of‐fact , that the near approach of dissolution it was which thus covered him over with shadow . In this mental condition , he wrote several times to Laura , to break off the engagement she had taken on herself . To him it was a matter of indifference , but to her it would plainly be mere misery . Laura , however , heeded no more what he said about himself than she had heeded the evil reports of the physician , when he was ill at Chanson Wood . She had her own intemperate hallucination about Leslie , which had begun in fancy , went on in jealousy , and was confirmed by the measures into which she had thrown her conscience , and her very soul , to secure him . It was not likely that she should stop now . If a thing could be done twice , it would very seldom be done the second time . But the girl who marries for money must reach the enjoyment of coaches , respect , and fine clothes before — if it were to be done again — she would not do it ; the man who sets his fancy on power , must have possessed the pride of governing , and the homage of the multitude , before he can tell whether the sacrifices made for it were worth while . In the same way , Laura , with a mind incapable of self‐control or self‐sacrifice , acknow‐ ledged no alternative except being the wife of Leslie ; and thus , under gloomy auspices , their marriage was privately celebrated in the drawing‐room of Chanson Wood , during the month of November of this year . LESLIE ’S excuse to himself for marrying as he did , was the ever present conviction that he must die . But for that sick state of mind he could have done no such thing . He believed the world to be closed upon him , and circumstances drifting him towards Laura , he had wearily yielded himself to them for the few months he expected to know the last of life , and its society . Time , however , as any one more accustomed to illness would have anticipated , produced a gradual amelioration ; and it was with reluctance that Leslie found himself compelled to acknowledge a renewal of the life which his will was ever prompt to lay down . The commonplace matters of a household in which he was called to act , did him good . A detected poacher , for instance , a cheating tradesman , a groom who neglected a horse ; and he would have been ashamed to suffer the intellectual despair which consumed him , to show itself among practical men , or domestics of his house . He had letters to write about ordering claret , or paying for a dog‐cart , and not deigning to ask assistance , performed these commonplace tasks , and found they made inroads on the army of his phantoms . When he mounted his horse again , the familiar exercise was useful to him , and the first animal he rode being excessively perverse and obstinate , he had no time to meditate by brook sides , or through shadowy lanes . Thus through the winter he went on resuming his intellectual health , though the moral sank to a lower and lower tone , as he continually reflected on the dream of innocence and virtue which had existed only to make him the dupe of a girl of seventeen . That false girl was ever present to his ideas , he repented his forbear‐ ance , he imaged her to himself in the society she had chosen , he analysed over and over the apparent guilelessness , the exquisite innocence of her demeanour , baffled how to reconcile them with what he knew of her treason . “
62277	62283	62264	62264	myself	0	” he repeated to himself . “
62302	62580	62581	62582	Poor Laura	26	” He had more thoroughly believed that he was speaking the truth , when he told Laura , that in marrying her , she was perfectly indifferent to him . So she was indeed , and very soon did Laura , after reaching the point she had allowed to dazzle her , begin the descent which led away from that glittering height . All her life she had so far taken pleasure in being popular , as to make people as comfortable as she readily could ; her brother ’s habits and fancies , her cousin ’s whims and wishes , she had never traversed , nay , much more had promoted , and this same patronising and good‐ humoured compliance she was now quite willing to extend to her husband . But in return she had hitherto got gratitude and worship , and had been exalted to the place of oracle in all matters which admitted a reference . There was a difference now ; for she had become the companion of a man excessively her superior , whose time and habits were spent on objects which required rather her exclusion than her assistance . She attempted changes , but found quickly that the ways of the house must be the ways of the master ; and that there was an unbending will in this respect which stopped her at once . To gain the upper hand , she tried jealousy , she tried sickness , she tried magnanimity , but all in vain ; Leslie kept her to her bargain , that in marrying him , it was her whim and fancy which were gratified . “
62583	62587	62589	62589	her	26	” he said to himself,“I
62613	63708	62606	62606	I	0	” Laura ’s goodhumour soon gave way to these trials ; her next effort was anger , passion , reproach ; but to those he put an authoritative stop . Love was far from them both he knew ; but ridicule should be equally far ; an outer decorum should prevail in his house ; and as for the rest , were not women proved to him to be creatures undeserving respect , incapable of goodness ? Rather more than a twelvemonth had passed since their ill‐omened marriage ; and however apparent the unsuitableness of Laura ’s character became , the secret of her machinations remained undiscovered . In the early days of her marriage , the apprehension that some chance might reveal it , had continually haunted her . Every letter which she saw Leslie reading made her anxious ; she watched his face for the sudden lighting of discovery ; she dreaded when he put it by and said nothing about the contents , that suspicion had been excited which he would silently follow out ; she examined his letters before they reached him , if she found it possible to do so ; and made pretexts , which afforded mirth to the servants’‐hall , to look at the addresses of those which he left for the post ; every acquaintance awakened her fears , lest some chance word should reveal the real position of those whom she had represented under such false colours ; and in her anxiety and alarm , she had invented many ingenious excuses for avoiding communication with all who could by any chance be acquainted with the persons and circumstances of the past months . But as time went by and no revelation took place , as Leslie remained unaltered , and no kind of allusion to the past ever arose between them , the silence in which all was involved began to give her confidence , and that which might have happened at any moment , and which did not happen , seemed like a thing gone into oblivion , which never could possess a tangible shape again . Laura grew bold in impunity , and then followed the reflection that she had secured the position she now occupied beyond the power even of discovery to dispossess her . By degrees she began to feel as if the very discovery would have its advantages . There would be at least a momentary triumph , in showing how she had outwitted Leslie ; and when his superiority weighed upon her , unsoftened by any kindness on his part , there would arise a longing on her ’s , to show that she had once baffled his talents , and possessed herself of a place from which no efforts of his could now remove her . It was a heavy secret , which she dreaded to betray , yet found it difficult to keep , and which would come almost into the shape of words occasionally , yet shrink back in terror when there arose a real chance that it should escape . In this uneasy state , irritation arose out of many a trivial circumstance ; harsh words were said on her side ; cold scorn of them was implied on his ; he forgot them , and was neither more nor less annoyed by the companion who had forced herself upon him than he had expected to be ; his interests were all apart from her , and were tinctured by the gloomy atmosphere which still clouded his spirits . The habits of his mind made him resort as necessarily to reading , as his bodily appetite to food ; but the only subjects which could fix his attention were the stern expression of great passion , the details of strong purpose and of grand crimes — whatever was bitter towards man , whatever lowered human nature , he dwelt upon , and thence broke away to his own gloomy reflections , pursuing the phantom of past faith and hope to their disappearance , and racking himself against the problem of Elinor ’s character and conduct ( as they appeared to him ) , which it baffled him to explain . He wearied himself with restless exercise , and sought the reality or the semblance of danger as a means of forgetting for a while his vain longing for the past ; and his hatred of the present . Miserable , but resolutely silent , he lived through the days . In these circumstances Mr. Chanson found them , when , in the end of the autumn following their marriage , he re‐ turned from a moor belonging to him in Scotland , and came to pay a visit at the Tower . He saw nothing that was going wrong ; outer forms were carefully observed , and he was satisfied with the smooth surface which was presented to his eye ; the bitter words which Laura could not restrain , were unanswered by her husband , or made to pass for jests ; the complaints she suggested were unreasonable ; and her brother , who , in the midst of all his admiration , had sometimes felt her government rather a severe one , secretly applauded the manner in which Leslie reigned so absolutely , yet without any ostentation of dominion . He was well pleased with his reception , with the amusements of the wild and extended country , and finding himself alone with his sister and his brother‐in‐law , his talk flowed more freely than it did when tramelled by society . They were all three one afternoon upon the terrace of the Tower , where the building wanted most repair , and where Leslie had arranged some plans of alteration . Laura was very much opposed to these ; she had always drawn the elevation of her brother ’s cottages , and had as constantly met with unbounded applause ; and when she first heard of the necessity of building at the Tower , she had prepared a drawing of battlements and loopholes , which Leslie negatived at once . The subject had been ever since a sore one , and Leslie avoided it as much as possible . To‐day he had been far from willing to make this spot the scene of their saunter , but Laura , who was in a bad temper , knew no ease till she had got her brother there , and could vent her discontent . “

65444	65461	65422	65422	he	56	” he repeated in a tone which would have startled one more observant than the Squire : “
65467	65468	65463	65463	he	56	” “
65500	65532	65495	65495	her	26	” Leslie kept silence , but with a sudden effort he broke in two the short stick which he held in his hand ; his brother‐in‐law looked at him in astonishment . “
65553	65554	65549	65549	you	0	” “
65566	65799	65556	65556	one	1228	” said Leslie , pitching away the broken pieces . Mr. Chanson rose from the stone wall where he had been sitting . Leslie also moved , and took the way towards the house , whither , following the impulse thus given , the Squire also bent his steps , and entering it by the first door they came to , Mr. Chanson turned into the hall , and Leslie , the moment he was alone , strode up stairs in quest of Laura . She knew he was coming , but did not know herself what mood his coming would excite in her . She was frightened at one moment , angry and fierce at another ; sometimes he seemed the Leslie upon whom she had let her fancy doat , and then the Leslie whom at other times she hated with all the violence of her former love . He found her , at apparent ease , in a lounging chair , with a newspaper in her hand . She looked at him as he entered almost as a wild animal would look , excited to self‐defence , and ready for flight or fight as the movements of the intruder might determine . Leslie came forward to the table which was on one side of her , and there he stood , saying at once in a perfectly calm voice , “
65817	65818	65811	65811	you	1044	” “
65824	65828	65830	65830	you	0	” said Laura ; “

65869	65870	65865	65867	that young girl	1017	” “
65876	65880	65873	65873	you	0	” said Laura . “
65884	65888	65881	65882	Elinor Ladylift	21	” Laura laughed . “
65910	65911	65903	65903	You	0	” “
65938	65939	65941	65941	Lawrence	51	” “
65944	65945	65941	65941	Lawrence	51	” “
65951	65970	65941	65941	Lawrence	51	” said Leslie , striking the table with his hand , and advancing a step nearer to Laura . “
65980	65981	65972	65972	you	0	” “
65989	65993	65982	65982	I	0	” said Laura . “
66005	66006	65994	65994	You	0	” “
66009	66013	65994	65994	You	0	” said Laura . “
66030	66031	66025	66025	yourself	0	” “
66039	66043	66032	66032	I	0	” said Laura . “

66073	66077	66070	66070	her	21	” said Laura . “
66097	66098	66095	66095	you	0	” “
66109	66113	66114	66114	you	0	” said Laura ; “
66136	66137	66117	66117	I	0	” “
66142	66146	66117	66117	I	0	” said Leslie ; “
66178	66183	66117	66117	I	0	” Laura sprang up . “
66263	66273	66260	66260	your	0	” But Leslie drew back as she approached him . “
66276	66280	66286	66286	you	0	” he said ; “
66398	67241	66394	66394	I	0	” He left the room at once . Laura sprang up before he was gone , and called him , but he closed the door and went to his room . Here , like a man who once possessing the amulet that ensured the blessing of his life , and who , dropping it into some profound lake , stands despairingly gazing into the waters ; did Leslie stand awhile , horror‐stricken at the knowledge of his own fate . All that he had left behind he now saw and knew ; all the clouds that had hidden past actions rolled away , and left the view of the sunny land behind him , which he had exchanged for the dreary pestilential region now surrounding him . The horror of his entanglement bewildered him ; the thought of all those days and months , wherein reparation for his cruel injustice had been delayed , pressed upon his senses ; the choking feeling of distance and alienation wrought so fiercely on him , that of all impossible things the most impossible to his imperious and self‐indulged nature was to delay by even another hour to seek , nay , to force an interview with Elinor , leaving the issue of that interview to be what it will . Springing out of the first torpor , he took measures at once to leave the Tower . He provided himself with what money was in the house ; he thrust his papers and letters into the drawers , and summoning a servant , bade him instantly prepare what was necessary for a journey , and bring it after him to the neighbouring town , whither he himself would proceed at once on foot . To put himself into action was the only relief he could find , and hastily he passed through the hall , and out on his road away , able he knew to conceal his emotion from any one he might casually meet , but not trusting himself either with inaction or with the sight of the woman who had ruined him . When joined by his servant , he took charge himself of the portmanteau , sending back the man without message or explanation , and hastened alone with all possible despatch to the coast . Here he took the first conveyance which crossed the sea , and was put ashore at early dawn on the Breton coast , at a village but a few miles from St. Cécile ’s nunnery . It was Thursday , and he remembered having heard Elinor say that Thursday was the day on which the pensioners were chiefly permitted to receive their visitors . He therefore pressed forward with all haste to add one more chance to those shadowy chances which remained of ever beholding that dear face again , but his heart died within him to think how faint they were ; sixteen months ’ grief , neglect , Time , what had they done ? Was she even there ? was she perhaps lying at perpetual rest beneath a reviving turf ? or if she lived , was she by this time a professed nun , alive , but dead to him ? Could she forgive him ? had he not believed accusations which the deceiver herself had thought it incredible to impose upon him ? Oh ! what mountain piles of sin had he not committed against the gentlest , most charitable , most defenceless of beings ! He saw the little low building rising before him with emotion that almost choked his breath . It stood on a common which descended to the sea‐shore , terminating in rushes and sand hills ; a marshy pool or two glittered in the sun , and some small cows were picking up the coarse herbage under the care of a boy and girl bareheaded and barefooted . The building itself was low , and formed a square , of which the side opposite Leslie was unpierced by windows , and except for one low door at the upper end , it might have been , what Leslie ’s gloomy feelings likened it to , a tomb . At this door he knocked , and presented a letter he had prepared , entreating per‐ mission , in her guardian ’s name , to speak to Miss Ladylift . The lay sister took it , and returning before long , conducted him to another part of the low , gray square , where she admitted him to the parlour and there left him . There was already a young girl , laughing with a motherly woman , and with a child , who seemed the girl ’s sister . Leslie turned to the window , his back to these people , his face therefore not to be seen at once , although he could watch whoever came in at the door . And before any long time , there was the voice he loved so fearfully . “
67246	67257	66394	66394	I	0	” and Elinor stood there looking at the group within . “
67268	67278	67279	67280	Mr. Leslie	24	” said Leslie , turning to her and approaching . “
67282	67296	67279	67280	Mr. Leslie	24	” cried Elinor , starting as if a bullet had struck her heart . “
67310	67314	67302	67302	you	0	” said Leslie ; “
67334	67335	67330	67330	you	0	” “
67342	67346	67336	67336	I	0	” said Elinor . “
67357	67361	67350	67350	you	0	” said Leslie ; “
67372	67373	67350	67350	you	0	” “
67378	67382	67414	67414	Good‐bye	1058	” said Elinor ; “
67416	67417	67414	67414	Good‐bye	1058	” “
67424	67445	67414	67414	Good‐bye	1058	” said Leslie , taking her hand , and drawing her to the window , while he spoke very low . “
67480	67481	67467	67467	You	24	” “
67488	67492	67467	67467	You	24	” said Elinor ; “
67508	67509	67503	67504	Your wife	1062	” “
67514	67518	67503	67504	Your wife	1062	” said Leslie . “
67532	67533	67529	67530	Miss Chanson	29	” “
67557	67558	67559	67559	You	24	” “
67563	67567	67559	67559	You	24	” said Elinor ; “
67579	67580	67577	67577	Farewell	89	” “
67592	67593	67585	67585	you	24	” “
67602	67606	67594	67594	I	0	” said Elinor . “
67617	67618	67619	67619	You	24	” “
67639	67658	67664	67665	my perfect	1065	” She did but bow her head as if in assent , but he felt her trembling hand . “
67667	67682	67683	67683	you	1064	” he cried , grasping that hand and trying to look into her eyes ; “
67719	67742	67743	67743	You	1064	” ’ Elinor hid her face as far as she could on her own shoulder , the tears ran down her cheeks . “
67748	67752	67753	67753	You	1064	” he repeated . “
67759	67763	67753	67753	You	1064	” said Elinor . “
67803	67810	67851	67851	Jacqueline	91	” A sob broke from Elinor . “
67815	67825	67851	67851	Jacqueline	91	” said the old mother , who was present ; “
67829	67830	67831	67831	Mais	90	” “
67840	67846	67831	67831	Mais	90	” whispered the young pensioner . “
67866	67897	67898	67898	I	0	” and the good woman drew away her girls , leaving the room to Leslie and Elinor . Leslie drew a chair for her , and sank down before her . “
67904	67915	67898	67898	I	0	” he said , dropping his face on her knees , “
67959	67960	67955	67955	I	0	” “
67971	67975	67955	67955	I	0	” said Elinor , “
67985	67986	67955	67955	I	0	” “
67996	67997	67955	67955	I	0	” “
68000	68010	67955	67955	I	0	” said Elinor , hiding her face and weeping . “
68057	68058	68061	68061	you	881	” “
68065	68069	68061	68061	you	881	” said Elinor ; “
68086	68087	68072	68072	you	881	” “
68127	68128	68111	68111	you	881	” “
68143	68144	68145	68145	Wife	513	” “
68174	68175	68167	68168	That woman	1060	” “
68182	68183	68176	68176	You	881	” “
68239	68273	68237	68237	Elinor	21	” Elinor ’s eyes raised to his face , reminded him of that day , now two years old , when they before so innocently looked at him , wondering at his meaning . “
68286	68287	68282	68282	she	1208	” “
68322	68323	68313	68313	Elinor	21	” “
68326	68330	68313	68313	Elinor	21	” said Elinor , “
68343	68344	68313	68313	Elinor	21	” “
68352	68356	68361	68361	your	21	” said Leslie ; “
68394	68395	68396	68396	I	0	” “
68401	68405	68396	68396	I	0	” said Elinor ; “

68441	68445	68396	68396	I	0	” said Elinor , “

68499	68500	68501	68501	I	0	” “
68526	68632	68517	68517	I	0	” Elinor forcibly rose , while Leslie with her hand in his , detained her , pleading , still more by the agony he suffered than by his words ; and at that moment the door opened , and a tall handsome woman , her face bounded by the straight lines of her head‐gear , came in , and Elinor at once broke away , and took up her place , pressed close against the Reverend Mother . She whispered a word or two to the young girl , and Elinor instantly stood freely up , and though the tears ran over , spoke out , “
68641	68652	68653	68653	You	24	” and vanished through the door , from his sight . “
68663	68668	68653	68653	You	24	” said the Superior . “
68674	68680	68681	68682	Poor child	1088	” repeated Leslie , mechanically . “
68720	68721	68713	68713	they	1089	” “
68729	68733	68722	68722	I	0	” said Leslie . “

68799	68803	68804	68804	he	1228	” said Leslie , “

68838	68839	68828	68828	he	1228	” “

68909	68919	68898	68898	you	372	” repeated Leslie , hardly knowing what he said . “
68931	68936	68926	68926	I	0	” said the lady , “
68958	68959	68898	68898	you	372	” “
68962	68966	68898	68898	you	372	” said Leslie . “
68980	68985	68975	68975	you	372	” said the Superior . “

69082	69083	69076	69076	Elinor	21	” “
69088	69099	69076	69076	Elinor	21	” said Leslie , with infinite pity in his voice . “
69123	69124	69115	69115	she	21	” “
69130	69134	69128	69128	Elinor	21	” groaned Leslie . “
69175	69176	69177	69177	Madam	93	” “
69179	69183	69177	69177	Madam	93	” said Leslie , “
69215	69216	69259	69260	Reverend Mother	34	” “
69228	69251	69259	69260	Reverend Mother	34	” said the Superior . Leslie shrank as if his hand had found itself on the bag of a nest of hornets . “
69262	69266	69255	69255	her	21	” said he ; “
69297	69298	69288	69288	You	93	” “
69302	69310	69288	69288	You	93	” said the Superior , with dignity , “
