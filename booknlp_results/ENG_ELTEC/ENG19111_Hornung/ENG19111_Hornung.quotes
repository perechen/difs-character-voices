You will get this prescription made up in two bottles ; take the first before you go to bed to - night , and the second if you wake with an attack before five in the morning . You say you are staying the night with friends ; better give me the name and let me see if they 're on the telephone before you go . I want you to go to bed early , tell them not to call you in the morning , and come back to me the moment you 've had your breakfast . ”

8328	8354	8252	8252	Horace	113	“ I think he scores by them . He 'd tell you himself that he never even thinks of getting up to first school now . ”

8371	8388	8186	8188	the tall girl	506	“ Perhaps not ; but I do n't believe that happens so often as you think . ”
8389	8410	8252	8252	Horace	113	“ It happens often enough to justify him in making one good night pay for two or three bad ones . ”
8411	8426	8186	8188	the tall girl	506	“ I do n't call that playing the game . I call it shamming . ”
8427	8471	8186	8188	the tall girl	506	“ Well , if it is , he makes up for it . They were doing Ancient Greek Geography in his form at early school last term . Tony tackled it in his spare time , and got most marks in the exam . ”

8597	8650	8595	8595	Horace	113	“ the one term we were there together . So did Fred for the next year . But it 's rather rough on Fred and myself , who were both something in the school at his age , to hear and see for ourselves that Tony 's nobody even in the house ! ”
8665	8716	8651	8651	Lettice	112	“ But do n't you see , old boy , that it makes it the worse for Tony that you and Fred were what you were at school ? They measure him by the standard you two set up ; it 's natural enough , but it is n't fair . ”
8717	8727	8729	8729	Horace	113	“ He need n't be a flyer at games , ”
8738	8746	8729	8729	Horace	113	“ But he might be a tryer ! ”
8747	8760	8651	8651	Lettice	112	“ Wait till we get a little more breath into his body . ”
8761	8773	8651	8651	Lettice	112	“ A bag of oxygen would n't make him a cricketer . ”
8774	8783	8729	8729	Horace	113	“ Yet he 's so keen on cricket ! ”
8784	8821	8651	8651	Lettice	112	“ I wish he was n't so keen ; he thinks and talks more about it than Fred or I did when we were in the eleven , yet he never looked like making a player . ”
8822	8854	8651	8651	Lettice	112	“ I should say he thinks and talks more about most things ; it 's his nature , just as it 's Fred 's and yours to be men of action . ”
8855	8872	8874	8874	Horace	113	“ Well , I 'm glad he 's not allowed to cumber the crease this season , ”
8892	8898	8874	8874	Horace	113	“ To have him called our “
8902	8918	8919	8919	Lettice	112	” on the cricket - field of all places , is a bit too thick . ”
8925	8940	8941	8941	she	112	“ He 's as good a sportsman as either of you , at heart , ”
8945	8963	8941	8941	she	112	“ And I hope he may make you see it before this doctor 's done with him ! ”
8964	8968	8970	8970	Horace	113	“ This doctor ! ”
8982	9000	8970	8970	Horace	113	“ You mean the fool who wanted to send that kid round the world on his own ? ”
9001	9017	8941	8941	she	112	“ He 's no fool , Horace , and you know nothing whatever about him . ”
9018	9064	8970	8970	Horace	113	“ No ; but I know something about our Tony ! If he took the least care of himself at home , there might be something to be said for letting him go ; but he 's the most casual young hound I ever struck . ”
9065	9072	9073	9073	Lettice	112	“ I know he 's casual . ”
9094	9097	9099	9099	Horace	113	“ Besides , ”
9101	9117	9099	9099	Horace	113	“ he would n't be cured if he could . Think what he 'd miss ! ”
9118	9137	9139	9140	the girl	514	“ Oh , if you 're coming back to that , there 's no more to be said . ”
9147	9172	9139	9140	the girl	514	“ But I do come back to it . Is n't he up in town at this moment under this very doctor of yours ? ”
9173	9180	9099	9099	Horace	113	“ He 's not my doctor . ”
9181	9220	9139	9140	the girl	514	“ But you first heard about him ; you 're the innovator of the family , Letty , so it 's no use trying to score off me . Is n't Tony up in London to - night ? ”
9221	9227	9139	9140	the girl	514	“ I believe he is . ”
9228	9242	9244	9244	Horace	113	“ Then I 'll tell you what he 's doing at this moment , ”
9259	9286	9251	9251	he	113	“ It 's after eleven ; he 's in the act of struggling out of some theatre , where the atmosphere 's so good for asthma ! ”
9625	9636	9637	9637	he	97	“ I said he was n't doing much good there , ”
9640	9660	9637	9637	he	97	“ and I do n't think he is . Letty stood up for him , as she always does . ”
9661	9672	9674	9675	Mr. Upton	97	“ Do you mean that he 's doing any harm ? ”
9678	9703	9674	9675	Mr. Upton	97	“ Not for a moment . I never said there was any harm in Tony . I — I sometimes wish there was more ! ”
9704	9715	9716	9717	Mr. Upton	97	“ More manhood , I suppose you 'd call it ? ”
9724	9730	9732	9732	Horace	113	“ More go about him , ”
9765	9781	9783	9784	Mr. Upton	97	“ Yet you know how much he has to take all that out of him ? ”
9789	9793	9795	9795	Horace	113	“ I know , ”
9798	9830	9795	9795	Horace	113	“ and of course that 's really why he 's doing no good ; but I must say that doctor of his does n't seem to be doing him any either . ”
9874	9881	9883	9884	his father	284	“ I agree with you there ! ”
9887	10036	9883	9884	his father	284	“ I do n't believe in the man myself ; but he was recommended by the surgeon who has done so much for your poor mother , so what could one do but give him a trial ? The lad was n't having a fair chance at school . This looked like one . But I dislike his going up to town so often , and I dislike the letters the man writes me about him . He 'd have me take him away from school altogether , and pack him off to Australia in a sailing ship . But what 's to be done with a boy like that when we get him back again ? He 'd be too old to go to another school , and too young for the University : no use at the works , and only another worry to us all . ”

11952	11956	11976	11978	The strange man	603	“ It was . ”
11957	11961	11918	11918	he	92	“ Bring it . ”

12143	12159	12140	12140	he	92	“ Come , come ! He did n't send you to sleep in the Park . ”
12160	12174	12217	12217	he	92	“ But he took away the only thing that does me any good . ”
12175	12180	12217	12217	he	92	“ What 's that ? ”
12181	12185	12217	12217	he	92	“ Cigarettes d'Auvergne . ”
12186	12193	12217	12217	he	92	“ I never heard of them . ”
12194	12213	12217	12217	he	92	“ They 're the only thing to stop it , and he took away every one I had . ”
12341	12350	12352	12353	his companion	611	“ And your doctor forbids a sovereign remedy ! ”
12355	12369	12352	12353	his companion	611	“ I can not understand him , and I 'm a doctor myself . ”
12380	12386	12387	12387	he	92	“ My name is Baumgartner , ”
12395	12404	12387	12387	he	92	“ I do n't suppose you know it ? ”
12405	12414	12416	12416	Pocket	92	“ I 'm not sure I do n't , ”
12435	12442	12444	12445	Dr. Baumgartner	118	“ A schoolboy in the country , ”
12447	12493	12495	12496	the doctor	241	“ is scarcely likely to have heard of me ; but if you inquire here in London you will find that I am not unknown . I propose to carry you off to my house for breakfast , and a little rest . That is , ”
12503	12518	12495	12496	the doctor	241	“ if you will trust yourself to me first and make your inquiries later . ”
12649	12659	12632	12635	The gaunt grey man	618	“ How the chaps would rag him at school ! ”
12781	12791	12778	12778	Baumgartner	118	“ Try sitting with your head between your knees . ”

13094	13096	13070	13070	He	92	“ done ”
13217	13221	13223	13223	he	118	“ Sit down , ”
13424	13434	13436	13436	he	118	“ I was present at some of those engagements , ”
13438	13457	13458	13458	He	118	“ They were not worse than disarming a man who has just fired a revolver in his sleep ! ”
13545	13551	13559	13559	his	118	“ Do you take photographs ? ”
13563	13566	13568	13569	the schoolboy	283	“ Rather ! ”
13575	13607	13568	13569	the schoolboy	283	“ It 's the only thing I have to do instead of playing games . But I have n't got an instantaneous camera like that . I only wish I had ! ”
13680	13684	13686	13686	he	118	“ You see , ”
13688	13722	13723	13723	he	118	“ I must have my smoke like you ! I ca n't do without it either , though what is your misfortune is my own fault . So you are also a photographer ! ”
13739	13746	13748	13748	Pocket	92	“ I am only a beginner , ”
13750	13757	13748	13748	Pocket	92	“ but a very keen one . ”
13758	13773	13775	13776	the doctor	241	“ You do n't merely press the button and let them do the rest ? ”
13788	13812	13775	13776	the doctor	241	“ Rather not ! I develop , print , tone , and all the rest of it ; that 's half the fun . ”
13813	13818	13820	13820	Baumgartner	118	“ Plates or films ? ”
13827	13849	13820	13820	Baumgartner	118	“ Only plates , I 'm afraid ; you see , the apparatus is an old one of my father 's . ”
13876	13885	13887	13887	he	118	“ It 's none the worse for that , ”
13889	13920	13887	13887	he	118	“ So far we have much in common , for I always use plates myself . But what we put upon our plates , there 's the difference , eh ? ”
13921	13927	13929	13929	Pocket	92	“ I should imagine so , ”
13961	13971	13950	13950	himself	118	“ You take portraits of your friends , perhaps ? ”
13972	13977	13933	13934	Dr. Baumgartner	118	“ Yes ; often . ”
13978	13986	13987	13987	Pocket	92	“ In the body , I presume ? ”
13991	14000	13987	13987	Pocket	92	“ You only take them in the flesh ? ”
14001	14005	13933	13934	Dr. Baumgartner	118	“ Of course . ”
14006	14014	14016	14017	the doctor	241	“ Exactly ! I take the spirit , ”
14019	14025	14016	14017	the doctor	241	“ that 's the difference . ”
14102	14106	14107	14107	he	181	“ I see , ”
14112	14120	14107	14107	he	181	“ You go in for psychic photography . ”
14121	14124	14126	14126	Baumgartner	118	“ Psychic , ”
14157	14166	14149	14150	The doctor	241	“ And you do n't believe in it ? ”
14167	14174	14107	14107	he	181	“ I did n't say so . ”
14175	14183	14149	14150	The doctor	241	“ But you looked and sounded it ! ”
14184	14197	14199	14200	the boy	181	“ I do n't set myself up as a believer or unbeliever , ”
14213	14331	14199	14200	the boy	181	“ But I do say I do n't believe in the sort of thing I read somewhere last holidays . It was in a review of a book on that sort of photography . The chap seemed to have said you could get a negative of a spirit without exposing the plate at all ; hide away your plate , never mind your lens , only conjure up your spirit and see what happens . I 'll swear nothing ever happened like that ! There may be ghosts , you may see them , and so may the camera , but not without focusing and exposing like you 've got to do with ordinary flesh and blood ! ”
14384	14392	14394	14394	he	241	“ Well said , my young fellow ! ”
14396	14406	14394	14394	he	241	“ I agree with every syllable you have spoken . ”
14407	14419	14421	14421	Pocket	92	“ It 's a question of photography , not of spiritualism , ”
14431	14481	14482	14483	The boy	181	“ I agree , I agree ! All that is rubbish , pure moonshine ; and you see it even at your age ! But there 's much more in it than that ; you must see the rest as well , since you see so far so clearly . ”
14496	14512	14513	14513	he	181	“ You admit there may be such things as ghosts , as you call them ? ”
14521	14526	14513	14513	he	181	“ Certainly , sir . ”
14527	14547	14518	14519	an equal	669	“ Visible shapes , in the likeness of man ? As visible and yet as tangible as that sunbeam ? ”
14548	14551	14513	14513	he	181	“ Rather ! ”
14552	14565	14518	14519	an equal	669	“ You allow that the camera can see them if we can ? ”
14605	14608	14610	14611	the doctor	241	“ Then , ”
14622	14798	14610	14611	the doctor	241	“ then you admit everything ! You may not see these images , but I may . I may not see them , but my lens may ! Think how much that glass eye throws already upon the retina of a sensitised film that our living lenses fail to throw upon ours ; think of all that escapes the eye but the camera catches . Take two crystal vases , fill one with one acid and the other with another ; one comes out like water as we see it ; the other , though not less limpid in our sight , like ink . The eye sees through it , but not the lens . The eye sees emptiness as though the acid itself were pure crystal ; the lens flings an inky image on the plate . The trouble is that , while you can procure that acid at the nearest chemist 's , no money and no power on earth can summon or procure at will the spirit which once was man . ”
14906	14914	14903	14903	he	92	“ I knew I knew your name ! ”
14915	14924	14925	14925	Baumgartner	118	“ You do know it , do you ? ”
14941	14962	14925	14925	Baumgartner	118	“ It was in connection with the very book I mentioned . I knew I had come across it somewhere . ”
14963	14973	14903	14903	he	92	“ You read the correspondence that followed the review ? ”
14974	14979	14903	14903	he	92	“ Some of it . ”
14980	14986	14925	14925	Baumgartner	118	“ My letter among others ? ”
14987	14998	14903	14903	he	92	“ Yes ! I remember every word of it now . ”
14999	15023	14903	14903	he	92	“ Then you recall my view as to the alleged necessity of a medium 's co - operation in these spirit - photographs ? ”
15024	15036	15038	15038	Pocket	92	“ You said it was n't necessary , if I remember , ”
15046	15111	15038	15038	Pocket	92	“ It was the pith and point of my contention ! I mentioned the two moments at which I hold that a man 's soul may be caught apart , may be cut off from his body by no other medium than a good sound lens in a light - tight camera . You can not have forgotten them if you read my letter . ”
15112	15115	15117	15118	the boy	181	“ One , ”
15120	15127	15117	15118	the boy	181	“ was the moment of death . ”
15128	15134	15135	15136	the doctor	241	“ The moment of dissolution , ”
15140	15165	15135	15136	the doctor	241	“ But there is a far commoner moment than that , one that occurs constantly to us all , whereas dissolution comes but once . ”
15232	15237	15238	15239	the doctor	241	“ The other moment , ”
15249	15276	15238	15239	the doctor	241	“ is when the soul returns to its prison after one of those flights which men call dreams . You know that theory of the dream ? ”
15301	15388	15296	15296	he	241	“ You visit far countries in your dreams ; your soul is the traveller . You speak to the absent or the dead ; it is your soul again ; and we dismiss the miracle as a dream ! I fix the moment as that of the soul 's return because its departure on these errands is imperceptible , but with its return we awake . The theory is that in the moment of waking the whole experience happens like the flash of an electric spark . ”
15513	15518	15520	15521	the doctor	241	“ I grant you , ”
15523	15619	15520	15521	the doctor	241	“ that the final flight of soul from body is infinitely the more precious from my point of view . But how is one to be in a position to intercept that ? When beloved spirits pass it would be cold - blooded desecration ; and public opinion has still to be educated up to psychical vivisection ! I have myself tried in vain to initiate such education . I have applied for perfectly private admission to hospital deathbeds , even to the execution - shed in prisons . My applications have been peremptorily refused . ”
15630	15638	15639	15639	he	92	“ You could see a man hanged ! ”
15657	15661	15663	15664	the other	587	“ Why not ? ”
15669	15677	15678	15678	he	181	“ But as I am not allowed , ”
15684	15755	15678	15678	he	181	“ I have to do the best I can . If I can not be in at the death , I may still by luck be in at a dream or two ! And now you may guess why I wander with my camera where men come in to sleep in broad daylight . I prowl among them ; a word awakens them ; and then I take my chance . ”
15756	15769	15771	15771	Pocket	92	“ They 're not all like that man this morning , then , ”
15803	15807	15808	15808	he	241	“ This morning , ”
15811	15840	15808	15808	he	241	“ was like no other . I owe you some confidence in the matter . I had the chance of a lifetime this morning — thanks to you ! ”

15885	15890	15881	15881	Baumgartner	118	“ Wait one minute . ”

16708	16740	16649	16653	But the tense crimson face	722	“ You saw the figure ? Surely you saw something else , hovering over it ? I did , I swear I did ! But now we shall have to wait . ”
16838	16850	16833	16833	he	118	“ And I owe it to you , my young fellow ! ”
16894	16899	16900	16900	he	118	“ Open the window ! ”

17928	17955	17917	17917	Pocket	92	“ Nothing now , I 'm afraid , unless I could get some of those cigarettes . And Dr. Bompas would kick up an awful row ! ”

Napoleon thought nothing of your human life . Von Moltke , Bismarck , and our staff in Germany thought as little of it as Napoleon ; the Empire of my countrymen was founded on a proper appreciation of the infinitesimal value of human life , and your British Empire will be lost through exaggerating its importance . Blood and Iron were our watchwords ; they 're on the tip of every Fleet Street pen to - day , but I speak of what I know . I 've heard the Iron shriek without ceasing , like the wind , and I 've felt the Blood like spray from a hot spring ! I fought at Gravelotte ; as a public schoolboy you probably never heard the name before this minute . I fought in the Prussian Guard . I saw you looking at the pictures downstairs . I was in that charge across those hellish ridges . Over two thousand of us fell dead in half an hour , but we gained the victory . More Germans were killed that day — that sweltering August afternoon — than English in your whole South African War that took you years ! The flower of Germany fell at Gravelotte ; that was human life with a vengeance ! But an Empire rose out of my comrades ' ashes . And that 's all it 's for , this human life of yours : for the master - builders to lay out in their wisdom on the upward road . ”

I do n't see what they could possibly have to do with it , myself ; and really , but for the fluke of your being the one to find the body , and picking the first - fruits for what they 're worth , it 's the last kind of case that I should dream of touching with a ten - foot pole .

28229	28246	28227	28227	he	138	“ but I can give you four minutes , if that 's any good to you . ”
28340	28351	28323	28323	Thrush	138	“ I understand you 're a detective , Mr. Thrush ? ”
28352	28365	28323	28323	Thrush	138	“ Hardly that , Mr.——I've left your card in the other room . ”
28366	28374	28323	28323	Thrush	138	“ Upton is my name , sir . ”
28375	28399	28323	28323	Thrush	138	“ I do n't aspire to the official designation , Mr. Upton , an inquiry agent is all I presume to call myself . ”
28400	28408	28323	28323	Thrush	138	“ But you do inquire into mysteries ? ”
28409	28416	28323	28323	Thrush	138	“ I 've dabbled in them . ”
28417	28422	28323	28323	Thrush	138	“ As an amateur ? ”
28423	28431	28323	28323	Thrush	138	“ A paid amateur , I fear . ”
28432	28450	28323	28323	Thrush	138	“ I come on a serious matter , Mr. Thrush — a very serious matter to me ! ”
28451	28538	28323	28323	Thrush	138	“ Pardon me if I seem anything else for a moment ; as it happens , you catch me dabbling , or rather meddling , in a serious case which is none of my business , but strictly a matter for the police , only it happens to have come my way by a fluke . I am not a policeman , but a private inquisitor . If you want anything or anybody ferreted out , that 's my job and I should put it first . ”
28539	28605	28323	28323	Thrush	138	“ Mr. Thrush , that 's exactly what I do want , if only you can do it for me ! I had reason to fear , from what I heard this morning , that my youngest child , a boy of sixteen , had disappeared up here in London , or been decoyed away . And now there can be no doubt about it ! ”
28650	28658	28659	28659	he	97	“ When can I see you again ? ”
28665	28676	28659	28659	he	97	“ When ? What do you mean , Mr. Upton ? ”
28677	28687	28659	28659	he	97	“ The four minutes must be more than up . ”
28688	28720	28659	28659	he	97	“ Go on , my dear sir , and do n't throw good time after bad . I 'm only dining with a man at his club . He can wait . ”
28721	28728	28659	28659	he	97	“ Thank you , Mr. Thrush . ”
28729	28760	28659	28659	he	97	“ More good time ! How do you know the boy has n't turned up at school or at home while you 've been fizzing in a cloud of dust ? ”
28761	28921	28659	28659	he	97	“ I was to have a wire at the hotel I always stop at ; there 's nothing there ; but the first thing they told me was that my boy had been for a bed which they could n't give him the night before last . I did let them have it ! But it seems the manager was out , and his understrappers had recommended other hotels ; they 've just been telephoning to them all in turn , but at every one the poor boy seems to have fared the same . Then I 've been in communication with these infernal people in St. John 's Wood , and with the doctor , but none of them have heard anything . I thought I 'd like to do what I could before coming to you , Mr. Thrush , but that 's all I 've done or know how to do . Something must have happened ! ”
28922	28930	28932	28932	Thrush	137	“ It begins to sound like it , ”
28935	28954	28932	28932	Thrush	137	“ But there are happenings and happenings ; it may be only a minor accident . One moment ! ”
29009	29016	29018	29018	Thrush	137	“ In less than an hour , ”
29020	29074	29018	29018	Thrush	137	“ he will be back with a list of the admissions at the principal hospitals for the last forty - eight hours . I do n't say there 's much in it ; your boy had probably some letter or other means of easier indentification about him ; but it 's worth trying . ”
29075	29081	29083	29084	Mr. Upton	97	“ It is , indeed ! ”
29089	29097	29099	29100	Eugene Thrush	138	“ And while he is trying it , ”
29111	29130	29099	29100	Eugene Thrush	138	“ you 'll greatly oblige me by having a whisky - and - soda in the first place . ”
29131	29153	29018	29018	Thrush	137	“ No , thank you ! I have n't had a bite all day . It would fly to my head . ”
29154	29170	29172	29175	the convivial Mr. Thrush	137	“ But that 's its job ; that 's where it 's meant to fly , ”
29221	29236	29172	29175	the convivial Mr. Thrush	137	“ Go to your dinner , man , and let me waylay you later ! ”
29237	29305	29172	29175	the convivial Mr. Thrush	137	“ Thank you , I prefer to keep you now I 've got you , Mr. Upton ! My man begins his round by going to tell my pal I ca n't dine with him at all . Not a word , I beg ! I 'll have a bite with you instead when Mullins gets back , and in a taxi that wo n't be long . ”
29306	29316	29423	29424	Eugene Thrush	138	“ But do you think you can do anything ? ”
29330	29341	29172	29175	the convivial Mr. Thrush	137	“ If you give me time , I hope so , ”
29347	29395	29172	29175	the convivial Mr. Thrush	137	“ But the needle in the hay is nothing to the lost unit in London , and it will take time . I 'm not a magazine detective , Mr. Upton ; if you want a sixpenny solution for soft problems , do n't come to me ! ”
29435	29479	29423	29424	Eugene Thrush	138	“ I have n't asked you for a description of the boy , Mr. Upton , because it 's not much good if we 've got to keep the matter to ourselves . But is there anything distinctive about him besides the asthma ? ”
29480	29494	29405	29405	his	976	“ Nothing ; he was never an athlete , like my other boys . ”
29495	29506	29508	29509	Mr. Thrush	137	“ Come ! I call that a distinction in itself , ”
29518	29542	29508	29509	Mr. Thrush	137	“ But as a matter of fact , nothing could be better than the very complaint which no doubt unfits him for games . ”
29543	29551	29405	29405	his	976	“ Nothing better , do you say ? ”
29552	29577	29405	29405	his	976	“ Emphatically , from my point of view . It 's harder to hide a man 's asthma than to hide the man himself . ”
29578	29585	29508	29509	Mr. Thrush	137	“ I never thought of that . ”
29620	29630	29631	29631	he	137	“ I suppose it has never affected his heart ? ”
29654	29667	29651	29652	Mr. Upton	97	“ Is that why you sent round the hospitals , Mr. Thrush ? ”
29668	29680	29762	29763	Mr. Upton	97	“ It was one reason , but honestly not the chief . ”
29681	29690	29651	29652	Mr. Upton	97	“ I certainly never thought of his heart ! ”
29691	29709	29711	29711	Thrush	137	“ Nor do I think you need now , in the case of so young a boy , ”
29714	29735	29711	29711	Thrush	137	“ On the other hand , I should n't be surprised if his asthma were to prove his best friend . ”
29736	29742	29651	29652	Mr. Upton	97	“ It owes him something ! ”
29743	29753	29651	29652	Mr. Upton	97	“ Do you know what he does for it ? ”
29754	29760	29762	29763	Mr. Upton	97	“ Yes , I do , ”
29778	29788	29769	29769	he	97	“ He smokes , against his doctor 's orders . ”
29789	29795	29651	29652	Mr. Upton	97	“ Do you mean tobacco ? ”
29796	29804	29651	29652	Mr. Upton	97	“ No — some stuff for asthma . ”
29805	29809	29769	29769	he	97	“ In cigarettes ? ”
29810	29813	29651	29652	Mr. Upton	97	“ Yes . ”
29814	29821	29651	29652	Mr. Upton	97	“ Do you know the name ? ”
29822	29828	29769	29769	he	97	“ I have it here . ”
29884	29890	29891	29891	he	137	“ But this is magnificent ! ”
29902	29911	29891	29891	he	137	“ I confess I do n't see why . ”
29912	29916	29979	29980	Mr. Upton	97	“ Cigarettes d'Auvergne ! ”
29917	29922	29979	29980	Mr. Upton	97	“ Some French rubbish . ”
29923	29933	29891	29891	he	137	“ The boy has evidently been dependent on them ? ”
29934	29940	29979	29980	Mr. Upton	97	“ It looks like it . ”
29941	29953	29979	29980	Mr. Upton	97	“ And this man Bompas made him give them all up ? ”
29954	29963	29891	29891	he	137	“ So he has the impudence to say . ”
29964	29978	29979	29980	Mr. Upton	97	“ Is it possible you do n't see the importance of all this ? ”
29985	30063	29979	29980	Mr. Upton	97	“ I never heard of these cigarettes before ; they 're an imported article ; you ca n't get them everywhere , I 'll swear ! Your boy has got to rely on them ; he 's out of reach of the doctor who 's forbidden them ; he 'll try to get them somewhere ! If he 's been trying in London , I 'll find out where before I 'm twenty - four hours older ! ”
30064	30070	30072	30073	Mr. Upton	97	“ But how can you ? ”
30090	30095	30097	30098	Eugene Thrush	138	“ A. V. M. ! ”
30104	30111	30097	30098	Eugene Thrush	138	“ Who on earth is he ? ”
30112	30124	29979	29980	Mr. Upton	97	“ Nobody ; it 's the principle on which I work . ”
30125	30130	30072	30073	Mr. Upton	97	“ A. V. M. ? ”
30131	30145	30097	30098	Eugene Thrush	138	“ Otherwise the old nursery game of Animal , Vegetable , or Mineral . ”
30171	30178	30180	30180	Thrush	138	“ You divide things into two , ”
30182	30234	30180	30180	Thrush	138	“ and go on so dividing them until you come down to the indivisible unit which is the answer to the riddle . Animal or Vegetable ? Vegetable or Mineral ? Northern or Southern Hemisphere ? Ah ! I thought your childhood was not so very much longer ago than mine . ”
30246	30297	30235	30236	Mr. Upton	97	“ In this case it 's Chemists Who Do Sell D'Auvergne Cigarettes and Chemists Who Do n't . Then — Chemists Who Do and Did Yesterday , and Chemists Who Do but Did n't ! But we can probably improve on the old game by playing both rounds at once . ”
30298	30307	30309	30310	Mr. Upton	97	“ I confess I do n't quite follow , ”
30312	30322	30309	30310	Mr. Upton	97	“ though there seems some method in the madness . ”
30323	30333	30335	30335	Thrush	138	“ It 's all the method I 've got , ”
30338	30361	30335	30335	Thrush	138	“ But you shall see it working , for unless I 'm much mistaken this is Mullins back sooner than I expected . ”
30507	30521	30523	30524	Eugene Thrush	138	“ Do n't go , Mullins ! I 've another job for you , ”
30526	30546	30523	30524	Eugene Thrush	138	“ Take the telephone directory and the London directory , and sit you down at my desk . Look up “
30548	30550	30523	30524	Eugene Thrush	138	” under “
30552	30667	30523	30524	Eugene Thrush	138	” ; there are pages of them . Work through the list with the telephone directory , and ring up every chemist who 's on the telephone , beginning with the ones nearest in , to ask if he keeps d'Auvergne Cigarettes for asthma . Make a note of the first few who do ; go round to them all in turn , and be back here at nine with a box from each . Complain to each of the difficulty of getting 'em elsewhere — say you wonder there 's so little demand — and with any luck you should find out whether and to whom they 've sold any since Wednesday evening . ”
30668	30677	30679	30680	the ironmaster	976	“ But surely that 's the whole point ? ”
30682	30689	30691	30691	Thrush	138	“ It 's the next point , ”
30693	30738	30691	30691	Thrush	138	“ The first is to divide the chemists of London into the Animals who keep the cigarettes and the Vegetables who do n't . I should really like to play the next round myself , but Mullins must do something while we 're out . ”
30739	30748	30523	30524	Eugene Thrush	138	“ While we 're out , Mr. Thrush ? ”
30749	30778	30691	30691	Thrush	138	“ My dear Mr. Upton , you 're going to step across into the Cafe Royal with me , and have a square meal before you crack up ! ”
30779	30786	30788	30789	Mr. Upton	97	“ And what about your theatre ? ”
30812	30859	30860	30861	The ironmaster	976	“ The theatre ! I was only going out of curiosity to see the sort of tripe that any manager has the nerve to serve up on a Friday in June ; but I 'm not going to chuck the drama that 's come to me ! ”
31045	31057	31058	31058	he	97	“ I do n't see how your theory can work there , ”
31074	31081	31083	31083	Thrush	138	“ It should work all right , ”
31085	31209	31083	31083	Thrush	138	“ You take an absolutely worthless life ; what do you do it for ? It must be one of two motives : either you have a grudge against the fellow or his existence is a menace to you . Revenge or fear ; he wants your money , or he 's taken your wife ! But what revenge can there be upon a poor devil without the price of a bed on his indescribable person ? He has n't anything to bless himself with , and he makes it a bit too hot for somebody who has , eh ? So you whittle it down . And then perhaps by sheer luck you run your blade into the root of the matter . ”
31286	31300	31364	31364	his	137	“ That 's the second time you 've mentioned luck , Mr. Thrush ! ”
31301	31307	31364	31364	his	137	“ When was the first ? ”
31308	31336	31364	31364	his	137	“ You spoke of Friday as an unlucky day , as God knows this one is to me ! Are you of a superstitious turn of mind ? ”
31337	31341	31364	31364	his	137	“ Not seriously . ”
31342	31353	31364	31364	his	137	“ You do n't believe in dreams , for example ? ”
31354	31360	31362	31362	Thrush	137	“ That 's another question , ”
31376	31382	31362	31362	Thrush	137	“ Why do you ask ? ”
31383	31397	31364	31364	his	137	“ If you 're a disbeliever it 's no use my telling you . ”
31398	31409	31364	31364	his	137	“ Perhaps I 'm neither one thing nor the other . ”
31410	31422	31362	31362	Thrush	137	“ Have you ever known a mystery solved through a dream ? ”
31423	31430	31432	31432	Thrush	137	“ I 've heard of one , ”
31442	31492	31432	31432	Thrush	137	“ that 's the famous old murder in the Red Barn a hundred years ago . The victim 's mother dreamed three nights running that her missing daughter was buried in the Red Barn , and there she was all the time . There may have been other cases . ”
31493	31520	31538	31538	Thrush	137	“ Cases in which a parent has dreamt of an absent child , at the very time at which something terrible has happened to that child ? ”
31521	31527	31528	31529	The father	570	“ Any amount of those . ”
31561	31570	31572	31573	Mr. Upton	97	“ Do you think they 're all coincidences ? ”
31576	31588	31572	31573	Mr. Upton	97	“ Some of them may be , but certainly not all , ”
31593	31604	31572	31573	Mr. Upton	97	“ That would be the greatest coincidence of the lot ! ”
31605	31616	31618	31619	Mr. Upton	97	“ I hardly like to tell you why I ask , ”
31635	31644	31625	31625	he	137	“ You 've been dreaming about the boy ? ”
31645	31669	31572	31573	Mr. Upton	97	“ Not I ; but my poor wife has ; that was one reason why I dare n't tell her he had disappeared . ”
31670	31678	31625	31625	he	137	“ Why ? What was the dream ? ”
31679	31690	31625	31625	he	137	“ That she saw him — and heard a shot . ”
31691	31695	31696	31696	Thrush	137	“ A shot ! ”
31715	31723	31725	31726	Mr. Upton	97	“ She says she did hear one , ”
31728	31738	31725	31726	Mr. Upton	97	“ and that she was n't dreaming at all . ”
31739	31745	31725	31726	Mr. Upton	97	“ But when was this ? ”
31746	31754	31757	31757	Thrush	137	“ Between six and seven yesterday morning . ”
31914	31921	31923	31923	Thrush	137	“ Then that accounts for it , ”
31945	31951	31942	31942	his	137	“ What do you mean ? ”
31952	31973	31942	31942	his	137	“ That anybody as ill as that , more particularly a lady , is naturally fanciful , I 'm afraid . ”
31974	31986	31942	31942	his	137	“ Then you think it a mere delusion , after all ? ”
31987	32038	32039	32039	They	1105	“ My dear Mr. Upton , it would be presumption to express an opinion either way . I only say , do n't think too much about that dream . And since you wo n't keep me company in my cups , we may as well rejoin the faithful Mullins . ”
32143	32211	32212	32212	Mullins	139	“ You need a good night 's rest , my dear sir , and it 's no use climbing to my masthead for nothing . Mullins and I will do best if you do n't mind leaving us to ourselves for the night ; but first thing tomorrow morning I shall be at your service again , and I hope there will be some progress to report . ”
32231	32248	32212	32212	Mullins	139	“ Look at this , sir , look at this ! These are the d'Auvergne Cigarettes ! ”
32249	32254	32340	32340	Thrush	137	“ So I perceive . ”
32255	32266	32340	32340	Thrush	137	“ This stump is the stump of a d'Auvergne Cigarette . ”
32267	32276	32212	32212	Mullins	139	“ I hope you enjoyed it , Mullins . ”
32277	32286	32340	32340	Thrush	137	“ I did n't smoke it , sir ! ”
32287	32291	32340	32340	Thrush	137	“ Who did ? ”
32292	32332	32212	32212	Mullins	139	“ That 's for you to say , sir ; but it 's one of the little things I collected near the scene of the murder , but took for a common cheroot , yesterday morning in Hyde Park . ”
32333	32339	32340	32340	Thrush	137	“ Near the actual place ? ”
32359	32373	32340	32340	Thrush	137	“ Under a seat , sir , not above a hundred yards away ! ”
33219	33230	33232	33232	Pocket	92	“ My accident may have done the same for me , ”
34389	34393	34377	34377	Pocket	92	“ or something , ”
34607	34616	34617	34617	he	92	“ I 'm so sorry for starting you , ”
34620	34629	34631	34631	he	92	“ I just came in to say goodbye . ”
34643	34648	34649	34649	she	514	“ To say goodbye ! ”
34652	34669	34649	34649	she	514	“ Yes , I 've got to go . I 'm afraid the doctor 's out ? ”
34670	34681	34691	34691	She	514	“ Yes , he is . Wo n't you wait ? ”
34682	34690	34691	34691	She	514	“ I 'm afraid I ca n't . ”
34731	34741	34742	34742	she	514	“ He 'll be very sorry to miss you , ”
34752	34762	34764	34764	Pocket	92	“ And I 'm very sorry to miss him , ”
34771	34793	34764	34764	Pocket	92	“ He 's been most awfully good to me , and I wish you 'd tell him how grateful I am . ”

We might have had you falling downstairs in the middle of the night ; but I own that I was more prepared for the kind of relapse which appears to have overtaken you . I was afraid you had more on your soul than you could keep to yourself without my assistance , and that you would get brooding over what has happened until it drove you to make a clean breast of the whole thing . I tell you it 's no good brooding or looking back ; take one more look ahead , and what do you see if you have your way ? Humiliating notoriety for yourself , calamitous consequences in your own family , certain punishment for me ! ”

But my people would n't let me go . She sails this very day , and touches nowhere till she gets to Melbourne . If I could only raise the passage - money , or even stow away on board , I could go out in her still , and that would be the last of me for years and years ! ”

I am a medical man ; medical men may bring patients to their houses even when they have ceased to practise in the ordinary way . It is no business of hers , and what she chooses to think is no affair of ours .

Now I trust you , my young fellow ; you will play the game , as you call it , even as the poor lads in these pictures played it at Gravelotte , and die like them rather than go back an inch . Look at this one here . No , not the one with the ridges , but here where we come to bayonets and the sword . See the poor devils of the Prussian Guard ! See the sheet - lightning pouring into us from the walls of St. Privat ! Look at that fellow with his head bound up , and this one with no head to bind . That 's meant for our colonel on the white horse . See him hounding us on to hell ! And there 's a drummer drumming as though we could hear a single beat ! Our very colours were blown to ribbons , you see , and we ourselves to shreds ; but the shreds hung together , my young fellow , and so will you and I in our day of battle ! ”

I remember the case perfectly ; the medical evidence was that the shot had been fired at arm 's length . That is n't the range at which we usually bring ourselves down ! Then there was nothing to show that the man ever possessed a pistol , or even the price of one ; he was so stony it would have gone up the spout long before . The very same point crops up in the case of this poor boy . Who says he ever had a revolver in his life ? His father tells me explicitly that he never had ; I happened to ask the question , ”

40331	40451	40323	40323	Thrush	137	“ But life 's one long collection of coincidences ! That 's what I 'm always telling you ; the mistake is to look on them as anything else . Do n't you call it a bit of a coincidence that both these men should meet their death at the very hour of the morning when you 're on your way over here from Netting Hill , and in much the same degree of latitude , which you 've got to cross somewhere or other on your way ? Yet who has the nerve to say you must have gone through Holland Walk that other morning , and been mixed up in that affair because you are in this ? ”

It 's no use talking when we both seem to have made up our minds ; but I 'm always ready to unmake mine if you show me that young Mr. Upton carried a pistol , Mullins ! Now I should like my breakfast , Mullins , and you must be roaring inside for yours . The man who 's been knocking up chemists all night is the man to whom breakfast is due ; get your own and then mine , and after that you can tell me how you got on . ”

40935	40964	40778	40778	Mullins	139	“ Only in the Brompton Road ; a literary gentleman has a box regularly every week , and two in the autumn . Pringle , his name is . ”

41031	41041	41026	41026	Thrush	138	“ How did you worm that out , Mullins ? ”
41042	41077	40778	40778	Mullins	139	“ By changing my tune a bit , sir . I started asking if they knew anybody who could recommend the cigarettes from personal experience , as we were only trying them on hearsay . ”
41078	41095	40985	40985	Thrush	138	“ Very smart of you , Mullins ! And one wheezy novelist is the only consumer ? ”
41096	41119	41026	41026	Thrush	138	“ That 's right , sir , but the man in Knights - bridge sold a box on Thursday to a doctor . ”

41128	41144	40985	40985	Thrush	138	“ Bone - Gardner , I think it was a Dr. Otto Bone - Gardner . ”

41166	41189	41155	41155	Thrush	138	“ I 've heard of an Otto Baumgartner , though I ca n't say when or where . What 's his address ? ”
41190	41225	40985	40985	Thrush	138	“ He could n't tell me , sir ; or else he would n't . Suppose he thought I 'd be turning the doctor out next . Old customer , I understood he was . ”
41226	41231	40985	40985	Thrush	138	“ For d'Auvergne Cigarettes ? ”
41232	41238	41155	41155	Thrush	138	“ I did n't inquire . ”
41239	41313	40985	40985	Thrush	138	“ My good fellow , that 's the whole point ! I 'll go myself and ask for the asthma cigarettes that Dr. Baumgartner always has ; if they say he never had them before , that 'll be talking . His being a doctor looks well . But I 'm certain I know his name ; you might look it up in Who 's Who , and read out what they say . ”
41431	41434	41436	41436	Thrush	138	“ Parthenon ! ”
41447	41454	41440	41440	he	138	“ But what about his address ? ”
41455	41465	41467	41467	Mullins	139	“ There 's no getting hold of that address , ”
41473	41481	41467	41467	Mullins	139	“ It 's not given here either . ”
41482	41512	41440	41440	he	138	“ Well , the chemist or the directory will supply that if we want it , but I 'm afraid he sounds a wheezy old bird . The author of “
41515	41525	41440	41440	he	138	” deserves to have asthma all his nights , and “
41529	41575	41576	41576	Thrush	138	” smacks of the usual Schopenhauer and Lager . No , we wo n't build on Dr. Baumgartner , Mullins ; but we 'll go through the chemists of London with a small tooth - comb , from here to the four - mile radius . ”

41835	41966	41832	41833	Mr. Upton	97	“ Have n't I lost my boy , and was n't it these Cockney cads who turned him adrift in London ? I ought to have gone to them last night . I wish I had , when my blood was up after your dinner ; for I do n't mind telling you now , Mr. Thrush , that in spite of your hospitality I was none too pleased at your anxiety to get rid of me afterwards . It made me feel like doing a little bit for the boy on my own ; but I 'd called once on my way into town , and only seen a servant then , so I thought I 'd make sure of putting salt on somebody by waiting till this morning . ”
41995	42003	42005	42005	he	137	“ I confess I showed indecent haste , ”
42007	42036	42005	42005	he	137	“ but Mullins and I had our night 's work cut out , and he at any rate has not had his boots off since you saw him . ”

42055	42155	42044	42045	Mr. Upton	97	“ then I 'll say what I 've got to say in front of him , for you 're both my friends , and I 'll unsay all I said just now . Bear with my temper , both of you , if you can , for I feel beside myself about the boy ! It was all I could do to keep my hands off that smug little lump of London inhumanity ! Kept me waiting while he finished his breakfast , he did , and then came in polishing a hat as sleek as himself , and saying “
42157	42170	42005	42005	he	137	early!”—just as you set me off by saying yourself a minute ago . ”
42171	42184	42005	42005	he	137	“ But he seems to have told you something , Mr. Upton ? ”
42185	42232	42234	42234	Londoners	1343	“ Has he not ! He began by telling me he was sorry for me , confound him ! I could have made him sorrier for himself ! He was sorry for me , but what could he do ? London was a large place , and “
42235	42315	42316	42318	His two hearers	1345	” were busy men . I told him so were some of us in the iron - trade , but not too busy to keep an eye on boys who were friends of our boys . He said London life was different ; and I said so I could see . They never had spare beds at a moment 's notice , much less for boys who might set fire to the house or — or shoot themselves — — ”

In the first place he 's a semi - public man , though I do n't suppose you know his name . It 's Baumgartner — Dr. Otto Baumgartner — a German scientist of some distinction . ”
51178	51345	51172	51172	Thrush	137	“ There was some luck in it , of course , for he was the very first man I struck who 'd bought d'Auvergne Cigarettes since Wednesday ; but I was on his doorstep well within twenty - four hours of hearing that your son was missing ; and you may chalk that up to A. V. M. ! I might have been with him some hours sooner still , but I preferred to spend them getting to know something about my man . I tried his nearest shops ; perfect mines ! One was a chemist , who did n't know him by sight , and had never heard of the cigarettes , but remembered being asked for them by an elderly gentleman last Thursday morning ! That absolutely confirmed my first suspicion that Baumgartner himself was not the asthmatic ; if he had been , the nearest chemist would have known all about him . Yet he had gone to the nearest chemist first ! ”
51346	51582	51172	51172	Thrush	137	“ The nearest butcher was next door ; but he was so short about Baumgartner that I scented a true - green vegetarian . It was a false scent , Mr. Upton ; not to mention the baker and the candlestick - maker , there 's a little restaurant in the same row , which was about the fifth place where I began by asking if they knew where a Dr. Baumgartner lived in that neighbourhood . The little Italian boss was all over me on the spot ! The worthy doctor proved to be his most regular customer , having all his meals sent in hot from the restaurant in quite the Italian manner . I do n't suppose you see how very valuable this was to me . Germans love Italy , the little man explained ; but I said that was the one point on which I should never yield to Germany — and I thought I was going to be kissed across the counter ! It seems the good doctor lives alone with his niece ( not always even her ) , and keeps no servants and never entertains . Yet on Friday , for the first time since the arrangement was made , the old chap went to the restaurant himself to complain of short commons ; there had not been enough for them to eat on the Thursday night ! ”
51583	51589	51591	51592	Mr. Upton	97	“ Had they been alone ? ”
51599	51723	51591	51592	Mr. Upton	97	“ That 's the whole point ! My little Florentine understood they were , but I deduced one extra , and then conceived a course that may astonish you . It was the bold course ; but it nearly always pays . I lunched at my leisure ( an excellent Chianti my little friend keeps ) and afterwards went round and saw the doctor himself . The niece opened the door — I wish I 'd seen more of her — but she fetched her uncle at once and I begged for an interview on an urgent matter . He consented in a way that , I must say , impressed me very favourably ; and the moment we were alone I said , “
51741	51742	51724	51724	I	0	” ”
51743	51758	51759	51759	I	0	“ That took him aback , but not unduly ; so then I added , “
51793	51822	51774	51774	you	1614	” Is was treating him like a gentleman , but I believe in that ; there 's no shorter cut to whether a man is one or not . ”
51823	51859	51860	51860	I	0	“ Well , his face had lit up , and a very fine face it is ; it had n't blackened for the fifth of a second ; but I had a disappointment in store . “
51871	51875	51860	51860	I	0	” he said , “
51897	51901	51885	51885	He	1614	“ A. A. U. ”

51904	51909	51911	51911	Tony	135	“ Tony 's initials ! ”
51915	51926	51927	51928	his sister	260	“ But it never was Tony under a false name , ”
51931	51941	51927	51928	his sister	260	“ That settles it for me , Mr. Thrush . ”
51942	51958	51885	51885	He	1614	“ Not even if he 'd got into some scrape or adventure , Miss Upton ? ”
51959	51971	51885	51885	He	1614	“ He would never give a name that was n't his . ”
51972	51982	51927	51928	his sister	260	“ Suppose he felt he had disgraced his name ? ”
51983	51992	51885	51885	He	1614	“ My brother Tony would n't do it ! ”
51993	52000	51885	51885	He	1614	“ He might feel he had ? ”
52001	52005	52006	52007	the father	570	“ He might , ”
52010	52040	52006	52007	the father	570	“ even if he 'd done no such thing ; in fact , he 's just the kind of boy who would take an exaggerated view of some things . ”
52055	52076	52077	52077	Thrush	137	“ Or he might feel he was about to do something , shall we say , unworthy of you all ? ”
52085	52096	52098	52099	loyal Lettice	112	“ Then I do n't think he 'd do it , ”
52101	52111	52113	52114	Mr. Upton	97	“ Let us hear what you think he did , ”
52116	52141	52113	52114	Mr. Upton	97	“ It 's not what I think ; it 's what this man Baumgartner thinks , and his story that you ought to hear . ”
52230	52237	52239	52240	Mr. Upton	97	“ That 's a good man ! ”
52246	52278	52239	52240	Mr. Upton	97	“ I 'd like to take him by the hand — and those infernal Knaggses by the scruff of their dirty necks — and that old hag Harbottle by the hair ! ”
52279	52287	52289	52289	Lettice	112	“ I think of dear darling Tony , ”
52295	52319	52289	52289	Lettice	112	“ lying out all night with asthma — it was enough to kill him — or to send him out of his mind . ”
52320	52330	52332	52332	Thrush	137	“ I wonder if it could have done that , ”
52349	52356	52358	52358	Lettice	112	“ What are you keeping back ? ”
52374	52384	52386	52386	Thrush	137	“ Only something he 'd kept back from them , ”
52398	52499	52386	52386	Thrush	137	“ It was a surprise he sprang on them after waking ; it will probably surprise you still more , Mr. Upton . You may not believe it . I 'm not certain that I do myself . In the morning he had spoken of the Australian voyage as though you 'd opposed it , but withdrawn your opposition — one moment , if you do n't mind ! In the evening he suddenly explained that he was actually sailing in the Seringapatam , that his baggage was already on board , and he must get aboard himself that night ! ”
52500	52509	52535	52536	the other	587	“ I do n't believe it , Thrush . ”
52510	52529	52530	52530	Thrush	137	“ No more do I , father , for a single instant . Tony , of all people ! ”
52543	52564	52565	52565	he	137	“ I do n't say I altogether accept it myself ; that 's why I kept it to the end , ”
52568	52745	52565	52565	he	137	“ But we must balance the possibilities against the improbabilities , never losing sight of the one incontestable fact that the boy has undoubtedly disappeared . And here 's a man , a well - known man , who makes no secret of the fact that he found him wandering in the Park , in the early morning , breathless and dazed , and drove him home to his own house , where the boy spent the day ; they took a hansom , the doctor tells me , than which no statement is more quickly and easily checked . Are we to believe this apparently unimpeachable and disinterested witness , or are we not ? He was most explicit about everything , offering to show me exactly where he found the boy , and never the least bit vague or unsatisfactory in any way . If you are prepared to believe him , if only for the sake of argument , you may care to hear Dr. Baumgartner 's theory as to what has happened . ”
52758	52808	52754	52755	Mr. Upton	97	“ Well , we may as well hear what the fellow had to say to you ; we must be grateful to him for taking pity on our boy , and he was the last who saw him ; he may have seen something that we should n't guess . ”
52809	52812	52814	52815	Eugene Thrush	138	“ Exactly ! ”
52817	52900	52902	52902	he	138	“ he saw , or at any rate he now thinks he saw , enough to build up a pretty definite theory on the foundation of fact supplied by me . He did n't know the boy had come up to see a doctor and been refused a lodging for the night ; he understood he had come up to join his ship , and suspected he had been on a sort of mild spree — if Miss Upton will forgive me ! ”
52911	52919	52921	52921	she	1624	“ I do n't forgive the suggestion , ”
52923	52938	52921	52921	she	1624	“ but it is n't yours , Mr. Thrush , so please go on . ”
52939	53136	53143	53144	Mr. Upton	97	“ It 's an idea that Dr. Baumgartner continues to hold in spite of all I was able to tell him , and we must n't forget , as Mr. Upton says , that he was the last to see your brother . Briefly , he believes the boy did meet with some misadventure that night in town ; that he had been ill - treated or intimidated by some unscrupulous person or persons ; perhaps threatened with blackmail ; at any rate imbued with the conviction that he is not more sinned against than sinning . That , I think , is only what one expects of these very conscientious characters , particularly in youth ; he was taking something or somebody a thousandfold more seriously than a grown man would have done . Afraid to go back to school for fear of expulsion , ashamed to show his face at home ! What 's to be done ? He thinks of the ship about to sail , the ship he hoped to sail in , and in his desperation he determines to sail in her still — even if he has to stow away ! ”
53137	53141	53143	53144	Mr. Upton	97	“ My God ! ”
53146	53167	53143	53144	Mr. Upton	97	“ he 's just the one to think of it . His head was full of those trashy adventure stories ! ”
53174	53186	53188	53188	she	112	“ To think of it , but not to do it , ”
53200	53300	53197	53198	Mr. Thrush	137	“ But really , Miss Upton , he must have done something , you know ! And he actually talked to Dr. Baumgartner about this ; not of doing it himself , but of stowaways in general , à propos of his voyage ; and how many pounds of biscuit and how many ounces of water would carry one alive into blue water . There 's another thing , by the way ! He told Baumgartner the ship touched nowhere between the East India Docks and Melbourne ; he would be out of the world for three whole months . ”
53301	53308	53310	53311	Mr. Upton	97	“ And she only sailed yesterday ? ”
53319	53346	53347	53347	Thrush	137	“ And you let her get through the Straits of Dover and out to sea while you came down here to tell me this by inches ? ”
53357	53368	53370	53370	he	137	“ I 'm letting her go as far as Plymouth , ”
53372	53390	53370	53370	he	137	“ where one or both of us will board her tomorrow if she 's up to time ! ”
53391	53405	53197	53198	Mr. Thrush	137	“ You said she did n't touch anywhere between the docks and Melbourne ? ”
53406	53577	53578	53579	The ironmaster	976	“ No ; your son said that , Mr. Upton , and it was his one mistake . They do n't usually touch , but a son of one of the owners happens to have gone round in the ship to Plymouth for the trip . I got it first from an old boatswain of the line who 's caretaker at the office , and the only man there , of course , yesterday afternoon ; but I 've since bearded one of the partners at his place down the river , and had the statement confirmed and amplified . One or two pasengers are only going aboard at Plymouth , so she certainly wo n't sail again before to - morrow noon , even if she 's there by then . You will be in ample time to board her — and I 've got a sort of search - warrant from the partner I saw — if you go down by the 12.15 from Paddington to - night . ”
53742	53754	53755	53755	Thrush	137	“ And do you believe this astounding theory , Mr. Thrush ? ”
53771	53798	53755	53755	Thrush	137	“ It 's not my province to believe or to disbelieve , Miss Upton ; my job is to prove things one way or the other . ”
53799	53827	53834	53834	he	137	“ Then I 'll tell you just one thing for your guidance : my brother is absolutely incapable of the conduct you ascribe to him between you . ”
53910	53922	53923	53923	he	137	“ I never knew such a thing on this line before , ”
53926	53954	53923	53923	he	137	“ it 's all the harder luck , for I never was on such an errand before , and it 'll just make the difference to me . ”
53955	53961	53963	53963	Thrush	137	“ You 'll have time , ”
53978	53987	53989	53990	Mr. Upton	97	“ Not for what I want to do , ”
53993	54014	53989	53990	Mr. Upton	97	“ I want to shake that man 's hand , and to hear from his own lips about my boy ! ”
54015	54028	54029	54029	Thrush	137	“ I 'm not sure that you 'll find him at home , ”
54037	54046	54029	54029	Thrush	137	“ I 'll take my chance of that . ”
54047	54085	53989	53990	Mr. Upton	97	“ He said something about their both going out of town to - day — meaning niece and self . I heard her playing just before I left , and that seemed to remind him of it . ”
54086	54097	53989	53990	Mr. Upton	97	“ Well , Thrush , I mean to risk it . ”
54098	54104	54029	54029	Thrush	137	“ And losing the train ? ”
54105	54131	53989	53990	Mr. Upton	97	“ I can motor down to Plymouth ; there 's plenty of time . I might take him with me , as well as you ? ”
54132	54135	54137	54137	Thrush	137	“ Better , ”
54144	54161	54137	54137	Thrush	137	“ I 'd rather you did n't count on me for that trip , Mr. Upton . ”
54162	54167	53989	53990	Mr. Upton	97	“ Not count on you ”
54169	54178	54196	54197	the ironmaster	976	“ One of us will be quite enough . ”
54179	54194	54196	54197	the ironmaster	976	“ Have you some other case to shove in front of mine , then ? ”
54206	54218	54196	54197	the ironmaster	976	“ I should n't put it like that , Mr. Upton . ”
54219	54244	54245	54245	he	976	“ All right ! I 'll take your man Mullins instead ; but I 'll try my luck at that German doctor 's first , ”
54257	54267	54269	54269	Thrush	137	“ I 'm afraid you ca n't have Mullins , ”
54273	54280	54269	54269	Thrush	137	“ Want him yourself do you ? ”
54281	54301	54196	54197	the ironmaster	976	“ I do ; but I 'm afraid neither of us can have him just now , Mr. Upton . ”
54302	54310	54311	54311	Thrush	137	“ Why not ? Where is he . ”
54322	54326	54311	54311	Thrush	137	“ In prison . ”
54327	54335	54196	54197	the ironmaster	976	“ In prison ! Your man Mullins ? ”
54336	54359	54360	54360	Pocket	92	“ Yes , Mr. Upton , he 's the man they arrested yesterday on suspicion of complicity in this Hyde Park affair ! ”

54503	54570	54572	54572	he	92	“ What a tyrant you would make me out ! On the contrary , I think you show your wisdom in remaining quiet . Perhaps you would be quieter still with the window shut — so — and fastened to prevent it rattling . I will open it when I come up again . There shall not be a sound in the house to disturb you . ”
54617	54662	54670	54670	Pocket	92	“ A little fever , I 'm afraid ! I should get right into bed , if I were you . It 's nothing to be alarmed about , much less astonished ; you have been through so much , my poor young fellow . ”

55376	55388	55372	55373	The doctor	241	“ You 'll think better of that , my young fellow , ”
55433	55445	55428	55428	Baumgartner	118	“ Is there anything you could fancy , my young fellow ? ”

I take the responsibility for everything that has happened since the very first moment we met . Remember that , my young fellow ! I took the law into my own hands , and you I took into my own house for better or worse . You were worse then , remember , and yet I took you in ! Is it not strange that your asthma has entirely left you under my roof ? Does it not lead you to believe in me , my young fellow — to trust me perhaps more than you have done ? ”

I suppose you have not learnt what the golden rain is at your public school ? You English call it laburnum ; but we Germans have more imagination , thank God ! ”
58842	58847	58848	58848	she	124	“ It 's you ! ”
58859	58862	58863	58863	he	92	“ Yes , ”
58872	58880	58863	58863	he	92	“ did you think it was thieves ? ”

58984	59089	58976	58976	she	124	“ I did n't ! I broke in for my clothes ; he took them , too , this morning before he went out . They 're what I broke in for , and I 'd a perfect right ; you know I had ! And while I 'm about it I thought I might as well have this thing too . I knew it was in here somewhere . It was in there . And I 'm glad I got it , and so should you be , because you and I are in the house of one of the greatest villains alive ! ”
59126	59136	59138	59138	she	514	“ I begin to think my uncle was right , ”
59140	59157	59138	59138	she	514	“ This is the act of what he said you were , if anything could be . ”

59181	59277	59287	59287	her	1743	“ You wait till you hear all he 's done ! I do n't mean taking my revolver from me ; he was justified in that , if you like , after what I 'd done with it . He may even have been justified in taking away my clothes , if he could n't trust me to keep my word and stay in this awful house . But that is n't the worst . He encouraged me to write a letter home , to my own poor people who may think me dead — — ”
59278	59281	59287	59287	her	1743	“ Well ? ”

On Saturday morning he said they must have got it ; he kept on saying so , and you do n't know how thankful I was every time ! But yesterday afternoon I found scraps of my letter in the waste - paper basket in his room ; he 'd never posted it at all ! ”
59417	59435	59436	59436	he	1746	“ I 'm a fool to blub about it — but — but that was the Limit ! ”

59591	59729	59730	59730	He	1747	“ It was the most absolute accident that ever happened ; he saw it ; he can tell you ; but he never told me till hours afterwards . I was nearly dead with asthma ; he brought me here , he was frightfully good to me , I 'm grateful enough for all that . But he should have told me before the accident became a crime ! When he did tell me I lost my head , and begged him to keep me here , and afterwards when I came to my senses he would n't let me go . I need n't remind you of that morning ! After that I promised to stay on , and I 'd have kept all my promises if only my letter had gone to my poor people ! ”

60909	60951	60899	60900	the girl	514	“ I remember my uncle would take me to see it next day . He 's always so interested in mysteries . I 'm sure that 's the very spot he showed me as the one where it must have happened . ”
60952	60960	60871	60871	He	92	“ Did he take the photograph then ? ”
60961	60972	60871	60871	He	92	“ No ; he had n't his camera with him . ”
60973	60985	60987	60987	Pocket	92	“ Then this is the suicide , or whatever it was ! ”

61275	61282	61283	61283	she	514	“ Then what do you think ? ”
61298	61386	61283	61283	she	514	“ I think that Dr. Baumgartner has the strangest power of any human being I ever heard of ; he can make you do anything he likes , whether you like it yourself or not . The newspapers have been raking up this case in connection with — mine — and I see that one theory was that the man in this broken negative committed suicide . Well , if he did , I firmly believe that Dr. Baumgartner was there and willed him to do it ! ”
61387	61399	61288	61288	her	514	“ He must have been there if he took the photograph . ”
61400	61438	61288	61288	her	514	“ Is there another man alive who tries these things ? I 've told you all he told me about it , but I have n't told you all he said about the value of human life . ”
61439	61454	61288	61288	her	514	“ Nor need you ! He makes no secret of his opinion about that ! ”
61455	61501	61288	61288	her	514	“ Then put the two things together , and where do they lead you ? To these murders committed with the mad idea of taking the spirit in its flight from the flesh ; that 's his own way of putting it , not mine . ”
61502	61515	61288	61288	her	514	“ But I thought your case was an accident pure and simple ? ”
61516	61587	61288	61288	her	514	“ On my part , certainly ; but how do I know he could n't get more power over me in my sleep than at any other time ? He saw me walking in my sleep with this wretched revolver . He said himself I 'd given him the chance of a lifetime . You may be sure he meant before that poor man 's death , not after it . ”
61588	61594	61600	61600	she	124	“ It is n't possible , ”
61615	61628	61629	61629	she	124	“ And I know he has n't a pistol of his own , ”
61645	61660	61662	61662	Pocket	92	“ He had n't one on him that morning ; that I can swear , ”
61670	61725	61662	61662	Pocket	92	“ Mine was the only one in that cape of his , because I once jolly nearly had it out again when he came back into the room . There was nothing of the sort in his other coat , or anywhere else about him , or I could n't have helped seeing it . ”
62012	62018	61988	61988	he	92	“ Do n't you see ? ”
62024	62054	61988	61988	he	92	“ Not one of them 's been fired — it 's as I loaded it myself the other night ! It ca n't have been this revolver at all ! ”
62055	62067	61988	61988	he	92	“ But you must have known whether you fired or not ? ”
62068	62176	61988	61988	he	92	“ I tell you I was walking in my sleep till the row woke me . I 'd only heard it once before , in a room . It sounded loud enough for the open air , though I do remember wondering I had n't felt any kick . But I was so dazed , and there was this beastly thing in my hand ; and he took it from me in such a rage that of course I believed I 'd let it off . But now I can see I ca n't have done . It was n't my revolver and it was n't me ! ”
62177	62189	61988	61988	he	92	“ Yet you say yourself my uncle did n't carry one ? ”
62190	62226	62227	62228	The boy	181	“ I 'll swear he did n't ; but there 's another man in all this ! There was the man they arrested on Saturday — the man I was so keen to set free ! ”
62333	62349	62326	62326	he	181	“ Then my uncle might have put in a fresh one while you were asleep . ”
62350	62355	62304	62304	She	124	“ Why should he ? ”
62356	62372	62385	62385	Pocket	92	“ I do n't know , but it sounds quite as possible as the other . ”

62387	62453	62454	62454	He	181	“ There were fourteen in the box to start with , because I counted them , and we only shot away one at the Knaggses ' before we were cobbed . That left thirteen — six in the revolver and seven in my pocket . There are your six , and here 's one , two , three , four — and three 's seven ! ”
62541	62545	62547	62547	Phillida	124	“ Very well , ”
62551	62573	62547	62547	Phillida	124	“ then it 's all the more reason you should go this minute , and catch the very first train home . ”
62618	62626	62627	62627	he	181	“ I ca n't leave you now , ”
62643	62647	62627	62627	he	181	“ Why not ? ”
62648	62669	62670	62671	So Pocket	92	“ Because the whole thing 's altered ! I 'm not going to leave you with a man like that ! ”

62746	62764	62743	62743	she	1799	“ But suppose I do n't believe a word you say against my uncle behind his back ? ”
62765	62783	62728	62728	her	1799	“ I shall wait and say it to his face . That 's another reason for waiting . ”
62784	62801	62728	62728	her	1799	“ Do you think you 're the person to judge him — a boy like you ? ”
62802	62817	62743	62743	she	1799	“ I do n't say I am . I only say that print — — ”
62818	62828	62728	62728	her	1799	“ How do you know he took the negative ? ”
62829	62837	62728	62728	her	1799	“ I do n't , but — — ”
62838	62848	62850	62851	the girl	514	“ But you jump to conclusions like a baby ! ”
62864	63021	62850	62851	the girl	514	“ I never heard anybody like you for flying from one wild notion to another ; first you say he must have made you fire , though you own you were walking in your sleep with a loaded revolver , and then you 're sure you never fired at all , simply because you find the revolver fully loaded after days and days ! Then you find a photograph that need n't necessarily be what we thought it , that my uncle need n't have taken even if it was ; but you jump to another conclusion about him , and you dare to speak of him to me as though you knew every horrid thing you chose to think ! As if you knew him and I did n't ! As if he has n't been kind and good to me for years and years — and kind to you — far too kind — — ”
63094	63101	63102	63102	he	181	“ Will you come with me ? ”

63146	63167	63143	63143	Pocket	92	“ They 'd understand , and you 'd stay with us , Phillida ! You might live with us altogether ! ”
63175	63260	63168	63168	She	1804	“ Oh , Phillida , ca n't you see that they 'd do anything for you after all we 've been through together ? And I , oh ! there 's nothing I would n't do if only you 'd come with me now this minute ! I know there 's a train about ten , and I know where we could borrow the money on the way . Come , Phillida , get on your things and come away from all this horror ! ”
63334	63339	63341	63341	Pocket	92	“ But he is ! ”
63348	63451	63341	63341	Pocket	92	“ That 's the only possible explanation , and you 'd believe it fast enough if you 'd heard all he said to me that first night , and been with me in the dark - room when he developed his negative of the man he said I shot ! You 'd see how it all fits in , and how this other negative this morning simply shows he was at the bottom of that other affair as well ! Of course he 's mad ; but that 's the very reason why I ca n't go and leave you with him . ”
63452	63464	63473	63474	honest Pocket	92	“ He would be as he 's always been to me . ”
63465	63471	63473	63474	honest Pocket	92	“ I believe he would , ”
63476	63488	63473	63474	honest Pocket	92	“ Then why do n't you go away and leave us ? ”

67504	67526	67527	67527	Phillida	124	“ Something I saw in the paper he brought in with him . I lit the gas while you were upstairs . ”
67535	67547	67548	67548	she	1930	“ Nothing that you saw can make any difference to me , ”
67551	67567	67548	67548	she	1930	“ Do you remember my saying there must be another man in these — mysteries ? ”
67568	67590	67468	67468	her	1930	“ I think I do . What difference does it make ? Besides , the man you meant is in prison . ”
67591	67596	67468	67468	her	1930	“ He is n't ! ”
67597	67603	67548	67548	she	1930	“ You said he was ? ”
67604	67625	67468	67468	her	1930	“ He was let out early this morning ! Let me light the gas while you read it for yourself . ”
67637	67647	67648	67648	she	1930	“ I doubt if there 's anything in that , ”
67651	67688	67648	67648	she	1930	“ but what if there were ? Does it make it any better if a man has an accomplice in his crimes ? If he 's guilty at all , it makes it all the worse . ”
68264	68274	68276	68276	he	241	“ A lamp like that 's a dangerous thing , ”
68291	68325	68276	68276	he	241	“ you never know what may happen when a lamp does that ! I 'm glad the window was open ; it did n't go very near my young fellow , I hope ? ”
68349	68357	68359	68360	the doctor	241	“ It would have served you right , ”
68369	68404	68359	68360	the doctor	241	“ for sitting up so late , and keeping a young lady from her bed to bear you company . Come , Phillida ! I shall have another word with you , young fellow . ”
69292	69299	69301	69321	one whom he had never seen before , and did not now , being locked already in the motorist 's arms	2001	“ Your boy , I think ! ”
69323	69330	69331	69332	the father	570	“ When did you find him ? ”
69352	69360	69335	69335	he	570	“ Only last night when I wired . ”
69361	69365	69331	69332	the father	570	“ And where ? ”
69366	69380	69381	69382	The schoolboy	283	“ In the house where you and I could n't make ourselves heard . ”
69390	69401	69381	69382	The schoolboy	283	“ Why , I never saw you before this minute ! ”
69402	69423	69331	69332	the father	570	“ Well , I 've had my eye on you , more or less , for a day or two . ”
69424	69433	69435	69436	Mr. Upton	97	“ Then why did n't you wire before ? ”
69450	69501	69442	69442	his	97	“ I did n't get it till after nine o'clock — too late for the evening train — but I was n't going to waste three hours with a forty - horser eating its head off ! So here I am , on my way to the address you gave . ”
69502	69533	69331	69332	the father	570	“ It was plumb opposite Baumgartner 's . I mounted guard there the very night you left . He came out twenty minutes ago , and your boy after him ! ”
69534	69556	69442	69442	his	97	“ But what does it all mean , Thrush ? What on earth were you doing there , my dear boy ? ”
69589	69594	69595	69595	Thrush	137	“ Hiding , Tony ? ”
69603	69614	69615	69615	he	137	“ But at all events we found you better employed , ”
69620	69645	69615	69615	he	137	“ and the sooner we all take up the chase again the more chance we shall have of laying this rascal by the heels . ”
69646	69653	69655	69656	Mr. Upton	97	“ Take it up , then ! ”
69658	69684	69655	69656	Mr. Upton	97	“ Jump into the motor , and bring the brute to me when you 've got him ! I want to speak to my boy . ”
69817	69830	69803	69803	his	137	“ But why should you think he had an accomplice , Tony ? ”
69831	69867	69803	69803	his	137	“ He was unarmed the other morning . I 'm quite positive of that . And his niece , who lives with him , has never seen a firearm of any kind in the house . ”
69868	69909	69912	69913	the chauffeur	2009	“ Well , he 's villain enough to hang , if ever there was one ! It 's time we laid hold of him . Where 's Mr. Thrush ? I thought you 'd taken him on in the car ? ”
69986	69998	70000	70001	the chauffeur	2009	“ The car wo n't take anybody anywhere to - day , ”
70010	70023	70000	70001	the chauffeur	2009	“ I shall have to get a lorry to take the car . ”
70033	70045	70046	70046	he	2009	“ There 's a bit o ' tyre trouble for somebody ! ”
70186	70189	70193	70197	those bringing up the rear	2025	“ P'lice ! ”
70728	70733	70734	70734	he	92	“ Is he dead ? ”
70764	70771	70773	70774	the sweep	2067	“ Dead as an ' erring , ”
70777	70787	70773	70774	the sweep	2067	“ Sooicide in the usual stite o ' mind . ”
70788	70791	70793	70799	the other sweep over a sooty shoulder	2068	“ Rats ! ”
70801	70824	70793	70799	the other sweep over a sooty shoulder	2068	“ unless ' e shot ' isself first an ' swallered the shooter afterwards ! Some'un 's done ' i m in . ”
71029	71050	71051	71052	Mr. Upton	97	“ But have they no idea who did it ? Are they quite sure he did n't do it himself ? ”
71075	71086	71088	71088	he	97	“ It 's the one thing they are sure about , ”
71090	71253	71088	71088	he	97	“ In the first place no weapon was to be found , and we saw no sign of a camera either , though this boy tells me your uncle had his with him when he went out . That 's more or less conclusive in itself . But there was a doctor on the spot before we left , and I heard him say the shot could n't have been fired at very close quarters , and that death must have been instantaneous . So it 's no more a suicide than the case in Park Lane yesterday or the one in Hyde Park last week ; there 's evidently some maniac prowling about at dawn , and shooting down the first person he sees and then vanishing into thin air as maniacs seem to have a knack of doing more effectually than sane men . But the less we jump to conclusions about him — or anybody else — the better . ”
71326	71332	71333	71333	she	514	“ What must you think ! ”
71345	71353	71333	71333	she	514	“ Oh ! what must you think ? ”
71354	71361	71362	71362	he	2084	“ It 's no good thinking , ”
71371	71521	71362	71362	he	2084	“ We 're all three on the edge of a mystery ; we must see each other through before we think . Not that I 've had time to hear everything yet , but I own I ca n't make head or tail of what I have heard . I 'm not sure that I want to . I like a man 's secrets to die with him ; it 's enough for me to have my boy back again , and to know that you stood by him as you did . It 's our turn to stand by you , my dear ! He says it was n't your fault he did n't come away long ago ; and it sha n't be mine if you stay another hour alone in this haunted house . You 've got to come straight back with us to our hotel . ”
71722	71728	71730	71731	Mr. Upton	97	“ But that 's absurd ! ”
71734	71783	71730	71731	Mr. Upton	97	“ I 'm not going to leave a young girl like you alone in the day of battle , murder and sudden death ! You need n't necessarily come with us , as long as you do n't stay here . Have you no other relatives in London ? ”
71784	71793	71841	71843	a masterful man	2097	“ None anywhere that I know much about . ”
71794	71838	71839	71839	He	97	“ That does n't matter . It 's time they knew more about you . I 'll hunt them up in the motor , if they 're anywhere within a hundred miles , but you simply must let me take their place meanwhile . ”
72372	72383	72384	72385	the officer	2122	“ You do identify him , I suppose , miss ? ”
72394	72399	72384	72385	the officer	2122	“ Oh , yes ! ”
72403	72424	72425	72425	She	124	“ But he looks as I have not seen him look for years . There are worse things than death ! ”
72864	72875	72879	72880	the coroner	2753	“ They never told me they had n't got it , ”
73999	74028	73989	73989	they	2202	“ You are looking the wrong way ! Look where I am looking ; that way lies the truth you are poor fool enough to want to know ! ”
74280	74288	74290	74291	the ironmaster	976	“ I thought he was in prison ? ”
74298	74306	74290	74291	the ironmaster	976	“ Do you ever read your paper ? ”
74307	74317	74290	74291	the ironmaster	976	“ I have n't looked at one since Plymouth . ”
74318	74330	74290	74291	the ironmaster	976	“ Well , I howked him out first thing yesterday morning . ”
74331	74337	74290	74291	the ironmaster	976	“ You did , Thrush ? ”
74338	74358	74290	74291	the ironmaster	976	“ Why not ? I had need of the fellow , and that part of the game was up . ”
74372	74386	74359	74360	Mr. Upton	97	“ My good fellow , I wish to goodness you 'd explain yourself ! ”
74387	74395	74397	74397	Thrush	138	“ If I cared to be profane , ”
74405	74445	74397	74397	Thrush	138	“ I should refer you to the first chapter of the Book of Job . I provided the prisoner , and I 'd a perfect right to take him away again . Blessed be the song of the Thrush ! ”
74446	74453	74290	74291	the ironmaster	976	“ You say you provided him ? ”
74454	74475	74359	74360	Mr. Upton	97	“ In other words , I laid the information against my own man , but only with his own consent . ”
74476	74500	74359	74360	Mr. Upton	97	“ Well , well , you must have your joke , I suppose . I can afford to put up with it now . ”
74501	74510	74512	74512	Thrush	138	“ It was n't meant as a joke , ”
74522	74572	74512	74512	Thrush	138	“ If it had come off it would have been the coup of my career ; as it didn't — quite — one must laugh it off at one 's own expense . Your son has told you what that poor old sinner made him think he 'd done ? ”
74573	74577	74359	74360	Mr. Upton	97	“ Of course . ”
74578	74595	74359	74360	Mr. Upton	97	“ Would it surprise you to hear that one or two others thought the same thing ? ”
74596	74602	74512	74512	Thrush	138	“ Not you , Thrush ? ”
74603	74624	74359	74360	Mr. Upton	97	“ Not I to quite the same positive extent as my rascal Mullins . He jumped to it from scratch ! ”
74625	74634	74359	74360	Mr. Upton	97	“ He connected Tony with the Park murder ? ”
74635	74639	74512	74512	Thrush	138	“ From the word “
74642	74643	74512	74512	Thrush	138	” ”
74644	74659	74359	74360	Mr. Upton	97	“ On the strength of an asthma cigarette and my poor wife 's dream ? ”
74660	74709	74710	74711	Mr. Upton	97	“ No ; he did n't know about the dream . But he refused to believe in two independent mysteries at one time and on one spot . The eternal unities was too many measles for Mullins , though he never heard tell of 'em in his life . ”
74731	74743	74722	74722	He	97	“ And you never told me what was in your minds ! ”
74744	74784	74786	74786	Thrush	138	“ It was poison even in mine ; it would have been deadly poison to you , in the state you were in . I say ! I 'll wear batting - gloves the next time we shake hands ! ”
74794	74809	74786	74786	Thrush	138	“ You believed he 'd done it , and you kept it to yourself , ”
74818	74839	74840	74840	Thrush	138	“ Tell me , my dear fellow — did you believe it after that interview with Baumgartner in his house ? ”
74847	74895	74840	74840	Thrush	138	“ Do n't remind me of that interview , Mr. Upton ; there was the lad on the other side of so much lath - and - plaster , and I could n't scent him through it ! But he never made a sound , confound him ! ”
74896	74914	74786	74786	Thrush	138	“ Tony 's told me about that ; they were whispering , for reasons of their own . ”
74915	75014	74840	74840	Thrush	138	“ I ought to have seen that old man listening ! His ears must have grown before my purblind eyes ! But his story was an extraordinarily interesting and circumstantial effort . And to come back to your question , it did fit in with the theory of a fatal accident on your boy 's part ; he was frightened to show his face at school after sleeping in the Park , let alone what he was supposed to have done there ; and that , he believed , would break his mother 's heart in any case . ”
75015	75032	75034	75035	Mr. Upton	97	“ By Jove , and so it might ! It would n't take much just now , ”
75039	75108	75034	75035	Mr. Upton	97	“ So he thought of the ship you would n't let him go out in — and the whole thing fitted in ! Of course he had told the old ruffian — saving his presence elsewhere — all about the forbidden voyage ; and that gentleman of genius had it ready for immediate use . I 'm bound to say he used it on me with excellent effect . ”
75109	75113	75115	75116	the ironmaster—“though	3263	“ Same here , ”
75116	75142	74840	74840	Thrush	138	ironmaster—“though I 'd no idea what you suspected . I thought it a conceivable way out of any bad scrape , for that particular boy . ”
75143	75150	75152	75152	Thrush	138	“ It imposed upon us all , ”
75154	75214	75152	75152	Thrush	138	“ but one . I was prepared to believe it if you did , and you believed it because you did n't know your boy as well as you do now . But Miss Upton , who seems to know him better than anybody else — do you remember how she would n't hear of it for a moment ? ”
75215	75224	74840	74840	Thrush	138	“ I do so , God bless her ! ”
75225	75463	74840	74840	Thrush	138	“ That shook me , or rather it prevented me from accepting what I never had quite accepted in my heart . That 's another story , and you 're only in the mood for one at present ; but after seeing Baumgartner on Saturday , I thought I 'd like to know a little more about him , not from outsiders but from the inside of his own skull . So I went to the British Museum to have a look at his books . It was after hours for getting books , but I made such representations that they cut their red tape for once ; and I soon read enough to wonder whether my grave and reverend seignior was quite all there . Spiritualism one knows , but here was spiritualism with a difference ; psychic photography one had heard about , but here was a psychical photographer gone mad or bad ! When a gifted creature puts into admirable English his longing to snap - shoot the souls of murderers coming up through the drop , like the clown at Drury Lane , you begin to want him elected to a fauteuil in Broadmoor . Will you believe me when I tell you that I stumbled mentally on the very thing I shall presently prove to have been the truth , and that I dismissed it from my mind as the wildest impossibility ? ”
75464	75478	75480	75481	Mr. Upton	97	“ I do n't see how you 're going to prove it now , ”
75520	75537	75539	75539	Thrush	138	“ I shall want another chat with your lad when he 's had his sleep out , ”
75543	75569	75539	75539	Thrush	138	“ he 's told me quite enough to make me eager for more . But you have n't told me anything about your own adventures ? ”
75604	75614	75615	75615	he	138	“ What have I to tell compared with you ? ”
75618	75685	75615	75615	he	138	“ Those damned old wooden walls only cleared the Thames on Sunday morning , and they were n't near Plymouth when I left last night ; but my little aluminium lot broke all her records before I broke one of her wheels . What I want to know is what you did from the time I left on Sunday night to that great moment this morning . ”
75686	75697	75699	75699	Thrush	138	“ I sat down to watch Baumgartner , his house , ”
75701	75932	75699	75699	Thrush	138	“ The merit of those quiet little streets is that there are always apartments of sorts , though not always the most admirable sort , to be had in half the houses . There was quite a choice bang opposite Baumgartner 's , and I 'd taken a front room before you were through Hammersmith . Of course I explained that I had lost a last train , and the landlady 's son embarrassed me with pyjamas of inadequate dimensions . Well , I sat at the front window all night , for no better reasons than my strong feeling about the doctor 's writings , and your daughter 's disbelief in his yarn about her brother . Soon after five in the morning the old bird came out , and I was after him like knife . I tracked him to Knightsbridge without much difficulty , excepting the one of avoiding being spotted , but there that happened by the merest accident . He was passing under the scaffolding outside the church they 're pulling down there , and he 's so tall he knocked his hat off . I admit I was too close . He saw , and must have recognised me ; but I should n't have recognised him if I had n't seen him start out . He was wearing a false beard and spectacles ! ”
75933	75939	75941	75943	ingenuous Mr. Upton	97	“ That 's proof positive , ”
75949	76151	75946	75946	his	97	“ Well , I confess it 's something like it in this case ; but it was a very awkward moment for me . I had n't to let him see I knew him , nor yet that I was following him , and the only way was to abandon the chase as openly as possible . It was then I decided that it was no use leaving poor old Mullins in pawn to the police . I redeemed him without delay . We went back to my new rooms together , which I need n't tell you I liked so much that I brought a suit - case and took them for a week . Of course , as we had lost the run of Baumgartner , the next best thing was to watch for his return . Mullins took that on while I got some sleep ; when I awoke the Park Lane murder was the latest , and I wo n't say I did n't suspect who 'd done it . Perhaps I did n't tell you he had his camera with him as well as beard and goggles , and all three figured in the first reports . ”
76152	76168	75946	75946	his	97	“ But all this time you had no idea my boy was in the house ? ”
76169	76273	75946	75946	his	97	“ None whatever ; we saw the girl once or twice , but that was all until I wired last night . What I never saw myself was Baumgartner 's return ; but in the afternoon I sent Mullins round to another road to try and get a room overlooking the place from the back . Well , the houses were too much class for that ; but one was empty , and he got the key and risked going back to prison for the cause ! Suffice it that he set eyes on both man and boy before I sent that wire . ”
76274	76293	75946	75946	his	97	“ And you left my son in that murderer 's clutches a minute longer than you could help ? ”
76309	76477	76478	76478	Thrush	138	“ You must remember in the first place that I could n't be in the least sure it was your son ; in the second , if murder had been intended , murder would have been done with as little delay in his case as in the others ; thirdly , that we 've nothing to show that Dr. Baumgartner is an actual murderer at all , but , fourthly , that to raid his place was the way to make him one . Poor Mullins , too , as the original Sherlock of the show , was desperately against calling in the police under any circumstances . He assured me there was no sign of bad blood about the house , until the small hours , and then he saw your son make his escape . I told him he should have collared the lad , but he lost sight of him in the night and preferred to keep an eye on that poor desperate doctor . ”
76539	76550	76551	76551	he	138	“ Why on earth did you have Mullins run in ? ”
76560	76569	76571	76571	Thrush	138	“ I 'm not very proud of it , ”
76573	76583	76571	76571	Thrush	138	“ It did n't come off , you see . ”
76584	76593	76619	76619	he	976	“ But whatever could the object have been ? ”
76594	76610	76612	76612	Thrush	138	“ I must have a damn - it if I 'm to tell you that , ”
76635	76651	76619	76619	he	976	“ It was one way that occurred to me of putting salt on the lad . ”
76652	76655	76619	76619	he	976	“ Tony ? ”
76656	76659	76619	76619	he	976	“ Yes . ”
76660	76668	76619	76619	he	976	“ You puzzle me more and more . ”
76669	76779	76619	76619	he	976	“ Well , you see , I gathered that he was a particularly honourable boy , of fine sensibilities , and yet Mullins thought he had shot this man by accident and was lying low . I only thought that , if that were so , the news of an innocent man 's arrest would bring him into the open as quick as anything . Mullins proving amenable to terms , and having really been within a hundred miles of both murders at the time they were committed , the rest was elementary . But what 's the good of talking about it ? It did n't come off . ”
76780	76817	76818	76819	Mr. Upton	97	“ It very nearly did ! I can tell you that straight from Tony ; he was going to give himself up yesterday morning , if he had n't accidentally satisfied himself of his own innocence . ”
76878	76887	76888	76888	he	138	“ If only I could find that camera ! ”
76891	76925	76888	76888	he	138	“ It 's the touchstone of the whole thing , mark my words . If it 's an accomplice who did this thing , he 's got it ; even if not — — ”

78362	78440	78355	78356	the other	587	“ What I have called my life 's ambition demands but little explanation here . I have never made any secret of it , but , on the contrary , I have given full and frank expression to my theories in places where they are still accessible to the curious . I refer to my signed articles on spirit photography in Light Human Nature , The Occult Review and other periodicals , but particularly to the paper entitled “
78447	79294	78355	78356	the other	587	” in The Nineteenth Century and After for January of last year . The latter article contains my last published word on the matter which has so long engrossed my mind . It took me some months to prepare and to write , and its reception did much to drive me to the extreme measures I have since employed . Treated to a modicum of serious criticism by the scientific press , but more generally received with ignorant and intolerant derision , which is the Englishman 's attitude towards whatsoever is without his own contracted ken , my article , the work of months , was dismissed and forgotten in a few days . I had essayed the stupendous feat of awaking the British nation to a new idea , and the British nation had responded with a characteristic snore of unfathomable indifference . My name has not appeared in its vermin press from that day to this ; it was not mentioned in the paragraph about the psychic photographer which went the rounds about a year ago . Yet I was that photographer . I am the serious and accredited inquirer to whom the London hospitals refused admittance to their pauper deathbeds , thronged though those notoriously are by the raw material of the British medical profession . Begin at the bottom of the British medical ladder , and you are afforded the earliest and most frequent opportunities of studying ( if not accelerating ) the phenomena of human dissolution ; but against the foreign scientist the door is closed , without reference either to the quality of his credentials or the purity of his aims . I can conceive no purer and no loftier aim than mine . It is as high above that of your ordinary physician as heaven itself is high above this earth . Your physician wrestles with death to lengthen life , whereas I would sacrifice a million lives to prove that there is no such thing as death ; that this human life of ours , by which we set such childish store , is but a fleeting phase of the permanent life of the spirit . One shrinks from setting down so trite a truism ; it is the common ground of all religion , but I have reached it from the opposite pole . Religion is to me the unworthy triumph of instinct over knowledge , a lazy substitution of invention for discovery . Religion invites us to take her postulates on trust ; but a material age is deserving of material proofs , and it is these proofs I have striven to supply . Surely it is a higher aim , and not a lower , to appeal to the senses that can not deceive , rather than to the imagination which must and does ? But I am trenching after all upon ground which I myself have covered before to - day ; it is my function to - night to relate a personal narrative rather than to reiterate personal views . Suffice it that to me , for many years , the only path to the Invisible has been the path of so - called spiritualism ; the only lamp that illumined that path , so that all who saw might follow it for themselves , the lamp of spirit photography . It is a path with a bad name , a path infested with quacks and charlatans , and by false guides who rival the religious fanatics in the impudence of their appeal to man 's credulity . Even those who bear the lamp I hold aloft are too often jugglers and rogues , to whose wiles , unfortunately , the simple science of photography lends itself all too readily . Nothing is easier than the production of impossible pictures by a little manipulation of film or plate ; if the spiritual apparition is not to be enticed within range of the lens , nothing easier than to fabricate an approximate effect . And what spiritualist has yet succeeded in summoning spirits at will ? It is the crux of the whole problem of spiritualism , to establish any sort or form of communication with disembodied spirits at the single will of the embodied ; hence the periodical exposure of the paid medium , the smug scorn of the unbeliever , and the discouragement of genuine exploration beyond the environment of the flesh . There is one moment , and only one , at which a man may be sure that he stands , for however brief a particle of time , in the presence of a disembodied soul . It is the moment at which soul and body part company in what men call death . The human watcher sees merely the collapse of the human envelope ; but many a phenomenon invisible to the human eye has been detected and depicted by that of the camera , as everybody knows who has the slightest acquaintance with the branch of physics known as “
79297	79351	78355	78356	the other	587	” The invisible spirit of man surely falls within this category . To the crystal eye of science it is not so much invisible as elusive and intractable . Once it has fled this earth , the sovereign opportunity is gone ; but photography may often intercept the actual flight of the soul . ”
79352	79358	78355	78356	the other	587	“ I say no more than “
79360	80010	78355	78356	the other	587	” because there are special difficulties into which I need not enter here ; but they would disappear , or at least be minimised , if the practice received the encouragement it deserves , instead of the forbidding ban of a sentimental generation . It would hurt nobody ; it would comfort and convince the millions who at present have only their Churches ' word for the existence of an eternal soul in their perishable bodies . It would prove more , in the course of a few experiments , than all the Churches have proved between them in nineteen centuries . Yet how are my earnest applications received , in hospitals where men die daily , in prisons where they are still occasionally put to death ? I am refused , rebuffed , gratuitously reprimanded ; in fact , I am driven ultimately to the extreme course of taking human life , on my own account , in order to prove the life eternal . Call it murder , call it what you will ; in a civilisation which will not hear of a lethal chamber for congenital imbeciles it would be waste of time to urge the inutility of a life as an excuse for taking it , or the misery of an individual as a reason for sending him to a world which can not use him worse than this world . I can only say that I have not deprived the State of one conceivably profitable servant , or cut short a single life of promise or repute . I have picked my few victims with infinite care from amid the moral or material wreckage of life ; either they had nothing to live for , or they had no right to live . Charlton , the licensed messenger , had less to live for than any man I ever knew ; in the course of our brief acquaintance he frequently told me how he wished he was dead . I came across him in Kensington , outside a house to which an unseemly fracas had attracted my attention as I passed . Charlton had just been ejected for being drunk and insolent , and refusing to leave without an extra sixpence . I befriended him . He was indeed saturated with alcohol and honeycombed with disease ; repulsive in appearance , and cantankerous in character , his earnings were so slender that he was pitifully clad , and without a night 's lodging oftener than not . He had not a friend in the world , and was suffering from an incurable malady of which the end was certain agony . I resolved to put him out of his misery , and at the same time to try to photograph the escape of his soul . A favourable opportunity did not present itself for some time , during which Charlton subsisted largely on my bounty ; at last one morning I found him asleep on a bench in Holland Walk , and not another being in sight , and I shot him with a cheap pistol which I had purchased second - hand for the purpose , and which I left beside him on the seat . Yet the weapon it was that cast a doubt upon the authenticity of the suicide , despite my final precaution of stuffing a number of cartridges into the dead man 's pocket ; pot - house associates came forward to declare that he could never have possessed either the revolver or its price without their knowledge . Hence the coroner 's repudiation of the verdict at the inquest . Yet it is to be feared that the fate of such as poor Charlton excites but little public interest in its explanation , and that the police themselves never took more than an academic interest in the case . ”
80011	80295	78355	78356	the other	587	“ To me it was a bitter disappointment on other grounds . I had lost very few seconds between pulling the revolver trigger and pressing the bulb of my pneumatic shutter ; but one had to get back into position for this , and the fact remains that I was too late . The result may be found among my negatives . It is dreadfully good of the dead man , if not a unique photograph of actual death ; but it lacks the least trace of the super - normal . The flight of the soul had been too quick for me ; it would be too quick again unless I hit upon some new method . I had not only failed to leave convincing evidence of suicide , but the fatal pause between pistol - shot and snap - shot was due entirely to my elaborate attempt in that direction . It was not worth making again . The next case should be a more honest breach of the Sixth Commandment ; the shot to be fired , and the photograph taken , at the same range and all but at the same instant . There would be no further point in leaving the weapon behind , so I was free to choose the one best suited to my purpose , and to adapt it at my leisure to my peculiar needs . Eventually I evolved the ingenious engine which , no doubt , has already explained itself better than I could possibly explain it ; if not , the discoverer of the camera need not hesitate to experiment with the pistol , as it will not be loaded when found . ”
80397	80730	80386	80386	her	124	“ The perfection or completion of my device was the secret work of many weeks ; it brings me down almost to the other day , and to what I have described as the supreme folly of my life . I had everything in readiness for another attempt to liberate and photograph a human soul in consecutive fractions of a second . But the right man was never in the right place at the right time ; one saw him by the dozen in a crowd , but the people one met all by themselves , in the early summer mornings , stayed one 's hand repeatedly by the eager brightness of their eyes or a happy elasticity of step . Once an out - patient at the Brompton Hospital , whom I had dogged all the way down to Richmond Park , was cheated of a merciful end by dusk falling just as I had him to myself . No ; the dawn and the drunkard were still my best chance . So it was that the wretch whose name I forget met with his death in Hyde Park last Tuesday morning . I knew him by sight as a pot - house loafer of the Charlton circle , but it was quite by chance that I followed his uncertain footsteps through the Park , and saw him go deliberately to bed in the drenching dew . His face filled in his tale ; it was another farrago of privation and excess . This was the type that caused me no compunction : having aimed and focussed at the same time , as my invention provides , I despatched the poor devil as he lay on his side , with his hat over his eyes , and exposed my plate as he rolled over on his face . It may be reckoned an offensive detail , but the click of my instantaneous shutter coincided with the last clutter in his throat . ”
80731	80965	80386	80386	her	124	“ I need hardly say that I had looked about me pretty thoroughly before firing , and my first act after taking the photograph was to make another wary survey of the scene . It had the advantage that one could see a considerable distance in three directions , and in none of these , neither right nor left along the path , nor yet straight ahead across the grass on the edge of which my victim lay , was a living creature to be seen . This was very reassuring , as I felt that I could see a good deal farther than the report of my small automatic pistol was likely to be heard ; for it is a remarkable feature of most shooting cases , especially where a pistol has been used , and in the open air , how seldom it is that a witness can be found who has actually heard the fatal shot . In the fourth quarter , where there was a bank of shrubbery behind some iron palings , I looked last , for I was standing with my back that way . How shall I describe my sensations on turning round ? There was a young lad within a few feet of me , on the other side of the palings ; and this young lad was flourishing a revolver in his right hand ! ”
80966	81430	81446	81446	They	2237	“ At first I made certain he had seen everything ; but his blank and frank bewilderment was more reassuring at a second glance , and at a third I guessed what had happened to him . His crumpled clothes were dank with dew . His eyes were puddles of utter stupefaction . He had been sleeping in the Park , and walking in his sleep , and in all probability it was my shot which had brought him to himself ; of this , however , I was less sure , and in my doubt I was disastrously inspired to accuse him of having fired the shot himself . It never struck me that he could mistake the body behind me for a living man ; it was with a wild idea of being the first to accuse the other , that I asked him if he knew what he had done , and seized his revolver at the same moment . I had the wit to grasp it in my hot hand until the barrel was just warm enough to help me convince the child that he really had fired the shot ; but , since he could not see it for myself , I was not going out of my way just then to tell him it was a fatal shot . Already I regretted that I had gone so far , and yet already I saw myself committed to a course of action as rash as it was now inevitable . The boy became convulsed with asthma ; I could not leave him there , to tell his story when the body was discovered , to have it disproved perhaps on the spot , at the latest on a comparison of bullets , and the truth brought home to me through his description . Again , when I had taken him to my house , with all sorts of foolish precautions , and still more foolish risks , I had to keep him there . How could I let him loose to blurt out his story and implicate me more readily than ever after what he had seen of me at home ? I had to keep him there — I repeat it — alive or dead . And I was not the kind of murderer ( if I am one at all ) to take a young and innocent life , if I could help it , to preserve my own ; on the contrary , I had , and I hope I always should have had , humanity enough at least to do what I could for a fellow - creature battling with an attack which almost threatened to remove him from my path without my aid . ”
81584	81605	81583	81583	he	118	“ greatly doubted whether they taught boys to put two and two together , at these so - called public schools ”
81631	81679	81583	81583	he	118	“ The madness of keeping him prisoner , as he had been from the beginning , in spite of all pretences and persuasions to the contrary , was another thing to which Baumgartner had been thoroughly alive all along . He had regarded it from the first as “
81686	81825	81832	81832	he	2244	” ; from the first , he had been prepared with specious explanations for any such inquisitor as the one who had actually arrived no later than the Saturday afternoon . He wrote without elation of his interview with Thrush , whose name he knew ; the doctor had not been deceived as to the transitory character of his own deception . It was the same with the letter which he had pretended to post , which could only have kept the boy quiet for a day or two , if he had posted it , but which the boy himself had discovered never to have been posted at all . There was a sufficiently cool description of the desperate mood into which Baumgartner 's intuition of the boy 's discovery had thrown him on the Sunday night . ”
81826	81831	81832	81832	he	2244	“ It was then , ”
81835	82015	81832	81832	he	2244	“ that I formed a project which I should have been sorry indeed to carry out , though I should certainly have done so if he had given me the chance I sought . It must be understood that my second attempt to photograph the flight of the soul had proved as great a fiasco as the first . Suddenly I hit upon a perfectly conceivable ( even though it seem a wilfully grotesque ) explanation of my failure . What if the human derelicts I had so far chosen for my experiments had no souls to photograph ? Sodden with drink , debauched , degraded , and spiritually blurred or blunted to the last degree , these after all were the least likely subjects to yield results to the spirit photographer . I should have chosen saints instead of sinners such as these , entities in which the soul was a major and not a minor factor . I thought of the saintliest men I knew in London , of some Jesuit Fathers of my acquaintance , of a “
82017	82337	82338	82339	The readers	2245	” specialist I know of who is destroying himself by inches in the cause of science , of certain missioners in the slums ; but I did not think twice of any one of them ; their lives are much too valuable for me to cut them short on the mere chance of a compensating benefit to mankind at large . Last , and longest , I thought of the boy upstairs . I had not meant to sacrifice him ; a young life , of some promise , is only less sacred to me than a mature life rich in beneficent activities . But this young fellow was going to be my ruin . I could see it in his eyes . He had found me out about the letter ; he would be the means of my being found out and stopped for ever in the work of my life . It was his life or mine ; it should be his ; but I was not going to take it there in the house , for reasons I need not enter into here , and I intended to take more than his life while I was about it . But he never gave me the chance . I did my best to get him to go out with me this morning . But he refused , as a horse refuses a jump , or a dog the water . He said he was ill ; he looked ill . But I have no doubt he was well enough to make his escape soon after my back was turned . I see he has broken into my dark - room for the clothes I took away from him before I went out ; he would scarcely remain after that ; but , to tell the truth , I have hardly given him a thought since my return . ”
82524	82526	82474	82474	his	167	“ straight ”
82646	83178	82629	82629	his	118	“ I thought the fool had cleared out long ago . The day 's excitement must have driven him clean out of my head . I never thought of him when I got back , never till I saw the damage to the darkroom window and missed his clothes . I did n't waste two thoughts upon him then . I had my negative to develop . A magnificent negative it was , too , yet another absolute failure from the practical point of view , perhaps from the same reason as its predecessors . South African mines may produce gold and diamonds ( licit and illicit ! ) but their yield in souls is probably the poorest to the square mile anywhere on earth . Schelmerdine never had one in his gross carcass . So there was an end of him , and a good riddance to rotten clay . I have not thought of him again all night . I have thought of nothing but this perhaps passionately dispassionate statement that I have made up my mind to leave behind me . It has given me strange pleasure to write , a satisfaction which I have no longer the time to attempt to analyse ; all night long my pen has scarcely paused , and I not conscious of a moment 's weariness of mind , body , or hand . Only sometimes have I paused to light my pipe . I had made such a pause , perhaps half an hour ago , when in the terrible stillness of the night I heard a footstep in the hall . My nerves were somewhat on edge with all this writing ; it might be my imagination . I stole to my door , and as I opened it the one below shut softly . I waited some time , heard nothing more , went down with my lamp , and threw open the drawing - room door . There was my young fellow , not gone at all , but sitting in the dark with one whose name there is no need to mention . I do not wish to be misunderstood . It was all innocent enough , even I never doubted that . But somehow the sight of that boy and girl , sitting there in the dark without a word , afraid to go to bed — afraid of me — made the blood boil over in my veins . I could have trampled on that lad , my Jonah whom I had pictured overboard at last , and I did hurl the lamp at his head . I am glad it missed him . I am glad he made good his escape while I was seeing his companion safe upstairs . If I had found him where I left him , God knows what violence I might not have done him after all . The boy has good in him , and more courage than he knows himself ; again I say that I am glad he has escaped unscathed . His life was not safe , but now I shall only take my own . ”
83179	83540	82615	82615	he	118	“ Yes ! I have made up my mind ; it is better than leaving it to the common hangman of this besotted country . I know what to expect in enlightened England : either a death unfit for a dog , or existence worse than death in a criminal lunatic asylum . I prefer my own peculiar quietus ; it has stood on my table all night long , ready and pointed at my heart ; a hand upon the door , a step behind me , and I should have rolled over dead at their feet . So it will be if even now they are waiting for me outside ; but , if not , I know where to go , where already it is broad daylight , where the wide open space will quicken and enhance every ray , and the broad river multiply the sun by a million facets of living fire . It is not the light that will fail me , there ; and as I have served others , so also will I serve myself , and it may be with better fortune than they have brought me . Who knows ? It would be in keeping with the poetic ironies of this existence . At all events , unless waylaid at once , I am giving it a chance . I shall place the camera on the parapet of the Embankment . I have fitted the shutter with a specially long pneumatic tube , and the bulb will do its double work as usual when my fingers relax . I have long had it all in my mind . I have written full instructions on the envelope which I shall stick by the flap to the open slide ; if we are found by a reasonably intelligent person , the slide will be shut , and the camera handed over bodily to the police . They , I think , may be trusted to honour one 's last instructions , if only out of curiosity ; their eyes will be the first to read what I fear they will describe as my “

So long as the document does not fall into one little pair of gentle hands , I shall lie easy in whatever ignominious grave they lay me . That is why I hide it where I do : since , if it fell first into those hands , it would never see the light at all . ”
83872	83879	83881	83881	he	92	“ And we never guessed it ! ”
83883	83924	83925	83925	He	92	“ That 's why he went in for this sort of double camera , and rigged it up to take both kinds of shot in quick succession . It 's the cleverest thing I ever heard of in my life . ”
83944	84063	83934	83934	Phillida	124	“ The cleverest part is the way you aim . I do believe he relied altogether on that spot about the middle of the focussing screen . I 've been trying it against the window , and where that spot comes the pistol 's pointing every time . It 's a fixed focus , about ten to fifteen feet , I fancy , and the spot is n't quite in the middle of the screen , but just enough to the left to allow . I do n't quite see how the one bulb works everything , but these springs and things are a bit confusing . We sha n't understand everything till we take it to pieces . ”
