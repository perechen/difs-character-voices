563	579	581	581	his	1116	“ Sir , you are mistaken ; I have not the honour to know you , ”
597	600	601	601	he	1116	“ Peste , ”
608	636	601	601	he	1116	“ I am certainly right . He is not much altered : of course I AM ; ten years of Paris would improve an orang - outang . ”
651	654	655	655	he	1116	“ Alain , ”
674	698	655	655	he	1116	“ Ten thousand pardons if I am wrong . Put surely I accost Alain de Kerouec , son of the Marquis de Rochebriant . ”
699	706	669	669	his	1116	“ True , sir ; but — ”
707	723	669	669	his	1116	“ But you do not remember me , your old college friend , Frederic Lemercier ? ”
724	729	731	731	Alain	351	“ Is it possibly ? ”
748	772	731	731	Alain	351	“ My dear Frederic , my dear friend , this is indeed good fortune ! So you , too , are at Paris ? ”
773	786	787	787	he	351	“ Of course ; and you ? Just come , I perceive , ”
819	827	829	829	Alain	351	“ I have been here a fortnight , ”
831	862	829	829	Alain	351	“ Hem ! I suppose you lodge in the old Hotel de Rochebriant . I passed it yesterday , admiring its vast facade , little thinking you were its inmate . ”
863	886	787	787	he	351	“ Neither am I ; the hotel does not belong to me ; it was sold some years ago by my father . ”
887	962	829	829	Alain	351	“ Indeed ! I hope your father got a good price for it ; those grand hotels have trebled their value within the last five years . And how is your father ? Still the same polished grand seigneur ? I never saw him but once , you know ; and I shall never forget his smile , style grand monarque , when he patted me on the head and tipped me ten napoleons . ”
963	970	972	972	Alain	351	“ My father is no more , ”
976	985	972	972	Alain	351	“ he has been dead nearly three years . ”
986	1036	829	829	Alain	351	“ Ciel ! forgive me ; I am greatly shocked . Hem ! so you are now the Marquis de Rochebriant , a great historical name , worth a large sum in the market . Few such names left . Superb place your old chateau , is it not ? ”
1037	1050	829	829	Alain	351	“ A superb place , no — a venerable ruin , yes ! ”
1051	1111	829	829	Alain	351	“ Ah , a ruin ! so much the better . All the bankers are mad after ruins : so charming an amusement to restore them . You will restore yours , without doubt . I will introduce you to such an architect ! has the ‘ moyen age ’ at his fingers ’ ends . Dear,—but a genius . ”
1139	1175	1124	1124	his	1124	“ I have no intention to restore Rochebriant . The walls are solid : they have weathered the storms of six centuries , they will last my time , and with me the race perishes . ”
1176	1353	829	829	Alain	351	“ Bah ! the race perish , indeed ! you will marry . ‘ Parlez moi de ca ’ : you could not come to a better man . I have a list of all the heiresses at Paris , bound in russia leather . You may take your choice out of twenty . Ah , if I were but a Rochebriant ! It is an infernal thing to come into the world a Lemercier . I am a democrat , of course . A Lemercier would be in a false position if he were not . But if any one would leave me twenty acres of land , with some antique right to the De and a title , faith , would not I be an aristocrat , and stand up for my order ? But now we have met , pray let us dine together . Ah ! no doubt you are engaged every day for a month . A Rochebriant just new to Paris must be ‘ fete ’ by all the Faubourg . ”
1354	1357	1359	1359	Alain	351	“ No , ”
1363	1380	1359	1359	Alain	351	“ I am not engaged ; my range of acquaintance is more circumscribed than you suppose . ”
1381	1430	829	829	Alain	351	“ So much the better for me . I am luckily disengaged today , which is not often the case , for I am in some request in my own set , though it is not that of the Faubourg . Where shall we dine?—at the Trois Freres ? ”
1431	1454	1359	1359	Alain	351	“ Wherever you please . I know no restaurant at Paris , except a very ignoble one , close by my lodging . ”
1455	1465	1359	1359	Alain	351	“ ‘ Apropos ’ , where do you lodge ? ”
1466	1474	829	829	Alain	351	“ Rue de l’Universite , Numero — . ”
1475	1628	1359	1359	Alain	351	“ A fine street , but ‘ triste ’ . If you have no longer your family hotel , you have no excuse to linger in that museum of mummies , the Faubourg St. Germain ; you must go into one of the new quarters by the Champs Elysees . Leave it to me ; I ’ll find you a charming apartment . I know one to be had a bargain,—a bagatelle,—five hundred naps a - year . Cost you about two or three thousand more to furnish tolerably , not showily . Leave all to me . In three days you shall be settled . Apropos ! horses ! You must have English ones . How many?—three for the saddle , two for your ‘ coupe ’ ? I ’ll find them for you . I will write to London to - morrow : Reese [ Rice ] is your man . ”
1629	1654	1656	1656	he	1126	“ Spare yourself that trouble , my dear Frederic . I keep no horses and no coupe . I shall not change my apartment . ”
1667	1670	1662	1662	himself	351	“ Faith , ”
1674	1772	1672	1672	Lemercier	352	“ is it possible that the Marquis is poor ? No . I have always heard that the Rochebriants were among the greatest proprietors in Bretagne . Most likely , with all his innocence of the Faubourg St. Germain , he knows enough of it to be aware that I , Frederic Lemercier , am not the man to patronize one of its greatest nobles . ‘ Sacre bleu ! ’ if I thought that ; if he meant to give himself airs to me , his old college friend,—I would — I would call him out . ”
1807	1847	1857	1857	he	8274	“ My dear Frederic , pardon me if I seem to receive your friendly offers ungraciously . But I believe that I have reasons you will approve for leading at Paris a life which you certainly will not envy ; ”
1864	1982	1857	1857	he	8274	“ But what a marvellous city this Paris of ours is ! Remember I had never seen it before : it burst on me like a city in the Arabian Nights two weeks ago . And that which strikes me most — I say it with regret and a pang of conscience — is certainly not the Paris of former times , but that Paris which M. Buonaparte — I beg pardon , which the Emperor — has called up around him , and identified forever with his reign . It is what is new in Paris that strikes and enthrals me . Here I see the life of France , and I belong to her tombs ! ”
1983	1991	1993	1993	Lemercier	352	“ I do n’t quite understand you , ”
1995	2081	1993	1993	Lemercier	352	“ If you think that because your father and grandfather were Legitimists , you have not the fair field of living ambition open to you under the Empire , you never were more mistaken . ‘ Moyen age , ’ and even rococo , are all the rage . You have no idea how valuable your name would be either at the Imperial Court or in a Commercial Company . But with your fortune you are independent of all but fashion and the Jockey Club . “
2106	2150	2101	2101	him	1128	” Half amused , half amazed , Alain Marquis de Rochebriant looked at Frederic Lemercier much as a good - tempered lion may look upon a lively poodle who takes a liberty with his mane , and after a pause he replied curtly , “
2213	2214	2257	2257	jockeys!—it	1132	” “
2219	2247	2257	2257	jockeys!—it	1132	” cried Lemercier , freeing himself from the arm of his friend , and laughing the more irresistibly as he encountered the grave look of the Marquis . “
2356	2569	2592	2592	He	1139	” The salons of the Trois Freres were crowded ; our friends found a table with some little difficulty . Lemercier proposed a private cabinet , which , for some reason known to himself , the Marquis declined . Lemercier spontaneously and unrequested ordered the dinner and the wines . While waiting for their oysters , with which , when in season , French ‘ bon - vivants ’ usually commence their dinner , Lemercier looked round the salon with that air of inimitable , scrutinizing , superb impertinence which distinguishes the Parisian dandy . Some of the ladies returned his glance coquettishly , for Lemercier was ‘ beau garcon ; ’ others turned aside indignantly , and muttered something to the gentlemen dining with them . The said gentlemen , when old , shook their heads , and continued to eat unmoved ; when young , turned briskly round , and looked at first fiercely at M. Lemercier , but , encountering his eye through the glass which he had screwed into his socket , noticing the hardihood of his countenance and the squareness of his shoulders , even they turned back to the tables , shook their heads , and continued to eat unmoved , just like the old ones . “
2572	2578	2592	2592	He	1139	” cried Lemercier , suddenly , “
2626	2939	2940	2942	wiry . ”	8319	” kissing his hand to a gentleman who had just entered and was looking about him for a seat . He was evidently well and favourably known at the Trois Freres . The waiters had flocked round him , and were pointing to a table by the window , which a saturnine Englishman , who had dined off a beefsteak and potatoes , was about to vacate . M. Duplessis , having first assured himself , like a prudent man , that his table was secure , having ordered his oysters , his chablis , and his ‘ potage a la bisque , ’ now paced calmly and slowly across the salon , and halted before Lemercier . Here let me pause for a moment , and give the reader a rapid sketch of the two Parisians . Frederic Lemercier is dressed , somewhat too showily , in the extreme of the prevalent fashion . He wears a superb pin in his cravat,—a pin worth two thousand francs ; he wears rings on his fingers , ‘ breloques ’ to his watch - chain . He has a warm though dark complexion , thick black eyebrows , full lips , a nose somewhat turned up , but not small , very fine large dark eyes , a bold , open , somewhat impertinent expression of countenance ; withal decidedly handsome , thanks to colouring , youth , and vivacity of regard . Lucien Duplessis , bending over the table , glancing first with curiosity at the Marquis de Rochebriant , who leans his cheek on his hand and seems not to notice him , then concentrating his attention on Frederic Lemercier , who sits square with his hands clasped,—Lucien Duplessis is somewhere between forty and fifty , rather below the middle height , slender , but not slight,—what in English phrase is called “
2942	3156	2940	2942	wiry . ”	8319	” He is dressed with extreme simplicity : black frockcoat buttoned up ; black cravat worn higher than men who follow the fashions wear their neckcloths nowadays ; a hawk ’s eye and a hawk ’s beak ; hair of a dull brown , very short , and wholly without curl ; his cheeks thin and smoothly shaven , but he wears a mustache and imperial , plagiarized from those of his sovereign , and , like all plagiarisms , carrying the borrowed beauty to extremes , so that the points of mustache and imperial , stiffened and sharpened by cosmetics which must have been composed of iron , looked like three long stings guarding lip and jaw from invasion ; a pale olive - brown complexion , eyes small , deep - sunk , calm , piercing ; his expression of face at first glance not striking , except for quiet immovability . Observed more heedfully , the expression was keenly intellectual,—determined about the lips , calculating about the brows : altogether the face of no ordinary man , and one not , perhaps , without fine and high qualities , concealed from the general gaze by habitual reserve , but justifying the confidence of those whom he admitted into his intimacy . “
3162	3166	3159	3160	mon cher	1141	” said Lemercier , “
3191	3192	3178	3178	I	0	” “
3261	3262	3252	3252	you	1141	” “
3303	3309	3298	3298	Alain	351	” The two gentlemen bowed . “
3322	3326	3310	3310	I	0	” said Duplessis . “
3329	3333	3310	3310	I	0	” returned Rochebriant . “
3346	3347	3334	3334	He	1151	” “
3369	3403	3360	3363	the Russian Princess C	1153	” The Marquis coloured high , inclined his head gravely , and made no reply . Here the waiter brought the oysters and the chablis , and Duplessis retired to his own table . “
3411	3424	3406	3409	the most extraordinary man	1155	” said Frederic , as he squeezed the lemon over his oysters , “
3432	3433	3360	3363	the Russian Princess C	1153	” “
3448	3460	3461	3461	His	1151	” said the Marquis , with the bluntness of a provincial . “
3489	3490	3472	3472	He	1151	” “
3507	3508	3499	3499	He	1151	” “
3556	3557	3561	3561	you	0	” “
3564	3571	3561	3561	you	0	” said the Marquis , indifferently ; “
3580	3581	3582	3582	I	0	” “
3590	3610	3582	3582	I	0	” answered Frederic , somewhat nettled by the phlegm with which the Provincial regarded the pretensions of the Parisian . “
3826	3866	3819	3819	You	1171	” Alain made a slight movement of incredulous dissent , and changed the conversation to reminiscences of old school - boy days . The dinner at length came to a close . Frederic rang for the bill,—glanced over it . “
3872	3914	3819	3819	You	1171	” said he , carelessly flinging down his napoleon and a half . The Marquis silently drew forth his purse and extracted the same sum . When they were out of the restaurant , Frederic proposed adjourning to his own rooms . “
3991	3992	3993	3993	I	0	” “
3997	4002	3993	3993	I	0	” answered the Marquis , “
4034	4035	4027	4027	you	1171	” “
4104	4105	4095	4098	the Duchesse de Tarascon	366	” “
4115	4116	4095	4098	the Duchesse de Tarascon	366	” “
4148	4149	4127	4127	She	366	” “
4159	4166	4127	4127	She	366	” returned the Marquis , dryly , “
4175	4176	4171	4171	her	366	” “
4191	4192	4186	4189	the Duc de Tarascon	368	” “
4206	4207	4203	4204	a butcher	1187	” “
4256	4257	4258	4258	My	0	” “
4332	4638	4639	4639	They	1202	” Frederic raised his eyebrows , but had the tact to pursue the subject no further . He who interferes in the quarrels of relations must pass through life without a friend . The young men now arrived at Lemercier ’s apartment , an entresol looking on the Boulevard des Italiens , consisting of more rooms than a bachelor generally requires ; low - pitched , indeed , but of good dimensions , and decorated and furnished with a luxury which really astonished the provincial , though , with the high - bred pride of an oriental , he suppressed every sign of surprise . Florentine cabinets , freshly retouched by the exquisite skill of Mombro ; costly specimens of old Sevres and Limoges ; pictures and bronzes and marble statuettes,—all well chosen and of great price , reflected from mirrors in Venetian frames,—made a ‘ coup d’oeil ’ very favourable to that respect which the human mind pays to the evidences of money . Nor was comfort less studied than splendour . Thick carpets covered the floors , doubled and quilted portieres excluded all draughts from chinks in the doors . Having allowed his friend a few minutes to contemplate and admire the ‘ salle a manger ’ and ‘ salon ’ which constituted his more state apartments , Frederic then conducted him into a small cabinet , fitted up with scarlet cloth and gold fringes , whereon were artistically arranged trophies of Eastern weapons and Turkish pipes with amber mouthpieces . There , placing the Marquis at ease on a divan and flinging himself on another , the Parisian exquisite ordered a valet , well dressed as himself , to bring coffee and liqueurs ; and after vainly pressing one of his matchless cigars on his friend , indulged in his own Regalia . “
4645	4660	4639	4639	They	1202	” said Frederic , with a tone of compassion at Alain ’s self - inflicted loss,—“ten
4675	4676	4639	4639	They	1202	” “
4686	4691	4639	4639	They	1202	” said the Marquis , “
4716	4717	4709	4709	you	1204	” “
5009	5081	5003	5003	Croesus	372	” Here there was a ring at the outer door of the apartment , and in another minute the valet ushered in a gentleman somewhere about the age of thirty , of prepossessing countenance , and with the indefinable air of good - breeding and ‘ usage du monde . ’ Frederic started up to greet cordially the new - comer , and introduced him to the Marquis under the name of “
5086	5087	5082	5084	Sare Grarm Varn	373	” “
5090	5106	5082	5084	Sare Grarm Varn	373	” said the visitor , as he took off his paletot and seated himself beside the Marquis,—“decidedly
5112	5130	5110	5110	Lemercier	363	” said he , in very correct French , and with the true Parisian accent and intonation , “
5182	5235	5237	5237	Grar	374	” The inscription on the card , thus drawn from its case and placed in Alain ’s hand , was — The Marquis gazed at it as he might on a hieroglyphic , and passed it on to Lemercier in discreet silence . That gentleman made another attempt at the barbarian appellation . “
5258	5291	5292	5294	Monsieur le Marquis	369	” Here the coffee and liqueurs were served ; and after a short pause the Englishman , who had very quietly been observing the silent Marquis , turned to him and said , “
5374	5375	5363	5363	him	363	” “
5414	5415	5416	5416	My	0	” “
5463	5483	5484	5494	The first loyal ‘ gentilhome ’ I have met at Paris	1242	” The Englishman said this with grace and feeling ; the Marquis ’s heart warmed to him at once . “
5496	5501	5484	5494	The first loyal ‘ gentilhome ’ I have met at Paris	1242	” thought the Legitimist ; “
5512	5532	5533	5533	You	1244	” Graham Vane , now stretching himself and accepting the cigar which Lemercier offered him , said to that gentleman “
5737	5738	5739	5739	I	0	” “
5748	5758	5743	5746	the lady you describe	1255	” answered Lemercier , feeling humiliated by the avowal ; “
5829	5830	5815	5815	you	1244	” “
5841	5846	5833	5833	I	0	” replied the Englishman ; “
5886	5887	5880	5880	Philippe	382	” “
5893	5897	5880	5880	Philippe	382	” said Lemercier ; “
5904	5905	5902	5902	Alain	351	” “
5911	5989	5907	5907	you	1244	” said the Marquis , briefly ; and he rose , drew on his gloves , and took up his hat . At these signals of departure , the Englishman , who did not want tact nor delicacy , thought that he had made himself ‘ de trop ’ in the ‘ tete - a - tete ’ of two friends of the same age and nation ; and , catching up his paletot , said hastily , “
6057	6058	6047	6047	I	0	” “
6061	6066	6047	6047	I	0	” said the Marquis ; “
6089	6097	6080	6107	the foreigner who visits our capital , and , ” he added in a lower tone , “ who speaks so nobly of those who revere its exiles	1266	” he added in a lower tone , “
6109	6160	6161	6161	My	0	” The Englishman saluted , and walked slowly towards the door ; but on reaching the threshold turned back and made a sign to Lemercier , unperceived by Alain . Frederic understood the sign , and followed Graham Vane into the adjoining room , closing the door as he passed . “
6223	6224	6228	6228	Duval	383	” “
6239	6240	6232	6232	she	383	” “
6245	6246	6232	6232	she	383	” “
6257	6258	6259	6259	You	363	” “
6274	6275	6262	6262	I	0	” “
6384	6385	6382	6382	Duval	383	” “
6539	6546	6521	6521	I	0	” Lemercier returned to the Marquis . “
6596	6623	6624	6624	My	0	” The Marquis paused a moment , and on his young face a proud struggle was visible . At last he said , bluntly and manfully , “
6738	6778	6731	6733	Alain de Rochebriant	351	” Lemercier was so astonished by this confession that he remained for some moments silent , eyes and mouth both wide open ; at length he sprang up , embraced his friend well - nigh sobbing , and exclaimed , “
6876	6877	6878	6878	My	0	” “
6884	6893	6878	6878	My	0	” said the young noble , deeply affected , “
6980	7298	7299	7299	Gently	391	” And breaking away from Lemercier ’s clasp , the Marquis hurried off . Alain reached the house in which he lodged . Externally a fine house , it had been the hotel of a great family in the old regime . On the first floor were still superb apartments , with ceilings painted by Le Brun , with walls on which the thick silks still seemed fresh . These rooms were occupied by a rich ‘ agent de change ; ’ but , like all such ancient palaces , the upper stories were wretchedly defective even in the comforts which poor men demand nowadays : a back staircase , narrow , dirty , never lighted , dark as Erebus , led to the room occupied by the Marquis , which might be naturally occupied by a needy student or a virtuous ‘ grisette . ’ But there was to him a charm in that old hotel , and the richest ‘ locataire ’ therein was not treated with a respect so ceremonious as that which at tended the lodger on the fourth story . The porter and his wife were Bretons ; they came from the village of Rochebriant ; they had known Alain ’s parents in their young days ; it was their kinsman who had recommended him to the hotel which they served : so , when he paused at the lodge for his key , which he had left there , the porter ’s wife was in waiting for his return , and insisted on lighting him upstairs and seeing to his fire , for after a warm day the night had turned to that sharp biting cold which is more trying in Paris than even in London . The old woman , running up the stairs before him , opened the door of his room , and busied herself at the fire . “
7305	7309	7299	7299	Gently	391	” said he , “
7328	7329	7331	7332	le Marquis	351	” “
7335	7343	7331	7332	le Marquis	351	” said the old woman , laughing . “
7392	7393	7384	7384	I	0	” “
7418	7419	7407	7416	a Madame la Marquise,—some pretty angel with a suitable dot	1306	” “
7449	7450	7435	7435	Marthe	392	” “
7467	7468	7470	7471	Bel avenir	394	” “
7474	7489	7470	7471	Bel avenir	394	” murmured the young man , bitterly , leaning his cheek on his hand ; “
7559	8375	8379	8379	myself	0	” Alain de Rochebriant had not been reared to the expectation of poverty . The only son of a father whose estates were large beyond those of most nobles in modern France , his destined heritage seemed not unsuitable to his illustrious birth . Educated at a provincial academy , he had been removed at the age of sixteen to Rochebriant , and lived there simply and lonelily enough , but still in a sort of feudal state , with an aunt , an elder and unmarried sister to his father . His father he never saw but twice after leaving college . That brilliant seigneur visited France but rarely , for very brief intervals , residing wholly abroad . To him went all the revenues of Rochebriant save what sufficed for the manage of his son and his sister . It was the cherished belief of these two loyal natures that the Marquis secretly devoted his fortune to the cause of the Bourbons ; how , they knew not , though they often amused themselves by conjecturing : and , the young man , as he grew up , nursed the hope that he should soon hear that the descendant of Henri Quatre had crossed the frontier on a white charger and hoisted the old gonfalon with its ‘ fleur - de - lis . ’ Then , indeed , his own career would be opened , and the sword of the Kerouecs drawn from its sheath . Day after day he expected to hear of revolts , of which his noble father was doubtless the soul . But the Marquis , though a sincere Legitimist , was by no means an enthusiastic fanatic . He was simply a very proud , a very polished , a very luxurious , and , though not without the kindliness and generosity which were common attributes of the old French noblesse , a very selfish grand seigneur . Losing his wife ( who died the first year of marriage in giving birth to Alain ) while he was yet very young , he had lived a frank libertine life until he fell submissive under the despotic yoke of a Russian Princess , who , for some mysterious reason , never visited her own country and obstinately refused to reside in France . She was fond of travel , and moved yearly from London to Naples , Naples to Vienna , Berlin , Madrid , Seville , Carlsbad , Baden - Baden,—anywhere for caprice or change , except Paris . This fair wanderer succeeded in chaining to herself the heart and the steps of the Marquis de Rochebriant . She was very rich ; she lived semi - royally . Hers was just the house in which it suited the Marquis to be the ‘ enfant qate . ’ I suspect that , cat - like , his attachment was rather to the house than to the person of his mistress . Not that he was domiciled with the Princess ; that would have been somewhat too much against the proprieties , greatly too much against the Marquis ’s notions of his own dignity . He had his own carriage , his own apartments , his own suite , as became so grand a seigneur and the lover of so grand a dame . His estates , mortgaged before he came to them , yielded no income sufficient for his wants ; he mortgaged deeper and deeper , year after year , till he could mortgage them no more . He sold his hotel at Paris ; he accepted without scruple his sister ’s fortune ; he borrowed with equal ‘ sang froid ’ the two hundred thousand francs which his son on coming of age inherited from his mother . Alain yielded that fortune to him without a murmur,—nay , with pride ; he thought it destined to go towards raising a regiment for the fleur - de - lis . To do the Marquis justice , he was fully persuaded that he should shortly restore to his sister and son what he so recklessly took from them . He was engaged to be married to his Princess so soon as her own husband died . She had been separated from the Prince for many years , and every year it was said he could not last a year longer . But he completed the measure of his conjugal iniquities by continuing to live ; and one day , by mistake , Death robbed the lady of the Marquis instead of the Prince . This was an accident which the Marquis had never counted upon . He was still young enough to consider himself young ; in fact , one principal reason for keeping Alain secluded in Bretagne was his reluctance to introduce into the world a son “
8380	8887	8379	8379	myself	0	” he would say pathetically . The news of his death , which happened at Baden after a short attack of bronchitis caught in a supper ‘ al fresco ’ at the old castle , was duly transmitted to Rochebriant by the Princess ; and the shock to Alain and his aunt was the greater because they had seen so little of the departed that they regarded him as a heroic myth , an impersonation of ancient chivalry , condemning himself to voluntary exile rather than do homage to usurpers . But from their grief they were soon roused by the terrible doubt whether Rochebriant could still be retained in the family . Besides the mortgagees , creditors from half the capitals in Europe sent in their claims ; and all the movable effects transmitted to Alain by his father ’s confidential Italian valet , except sundry carriages and horses which were sold at Baden for what they would fetch , were a magnificent dressing - case , in the secret drawer of which were some bank - notes amounting to thirty thousand francs , and three large boxes containing the Marquis ’s correspondence , a few miniature female portraits , and a great many locks of hair . Wholly unprepared for the ruin that stared him in the face , the young Marquis evinced the natural strength of his character by the calmness with which he met the danger , and the intelligence with which he calculated and reduced it . By the help of the family notary in the neighbouring town , he made himself master of his liabilities and his means ; and he found that , after paying all debts and providing for the interest of the mortgages , a property which ought to have realized a rental of L10,000 a year yielded not more than L400 . Nor was even this margin safe , nor the property out of peril ; for the principal mortgagee , who was a capitalist in Paris named Louvier , having had during the life of the late Marquis more than once to wait for his half - yearly interest longer than suited his patience,—and his patience was not enduring,—plainly declared that if the same delay recurred he should put his right of seizure in force ; and in France still more than in England , bad seasons seriously affect the security of rents . To pay away L9,600 a year regularly out of L10,000 , with the penalty of forfeiting the whole if not paid,—whether crops may fail , farmers procrastinate , and timber fall in price,—is to live with the sword of Damocles over one ’s head . For two years and more , however , Alain met his difficulties with prudence and vigour ; he retrenched the establishment hitherto kept at the chateau , resigned such rural pleasures as he had been accustomed to indulge , and lived like one of his petty farmers . But the risks of the future remained undiminished . “
8898	8907	8894	8896	Monsieur le Marquis	369	” said the family notary , M. Hebert , “
9381	10327	10328	10330	Monsieur le Marquis	369	” In pursuance of this advice , the young Marquis had come to Paris fortified with a letter from M. Hebert to an ‘ avoue ’ of eminence , and with many letters from his aunt to the nobles of the Faubourg connected with his house . Now one reason why M. Hebert had urged his client to undertake this important business in person , rather than volunteer his own services in Paris , was somewhat extra - professional . He had a sincere and profound affection for Alain ; he felt compassion for that young life so barrenly wasted in seclusion and severe privations ; he respected , but was too practical a man of business to share , those chivalrous sentiments of loyalty to an exiled dynasty which disqualified the man for the age he lived in , and , if not greatly modified , would cut him off from the hopes and aspirations of his eager generation . He thought plausibly enough that the air of the grand metropolis was necessary to the mental health , enfeebled and withering amidst the feudal mists of Bretagne ; that once in Paris , Alain would imbibe the ideas of Paris , adapt himself to some career leading to honour and to fortune , for which he took facilities from his high birth , an historical name too national for any dynasty not to welcome among its adherents , and an intellect not yet sharpened by contact and competition with others , but in itself vigorous , habituated to thought , and vivified by the noble aspirations which belong to imaginative natures . At the least , Alain would be at Paris in the social position which would afford him the opportunities of a marriage , in which his birth and rank would be readily accepted as an equivalent to some ample fortune that would serve to redeem the endangered seigneuries . He therefore warned Alain that the affair for which he went to Paris might be tedious , that lawyers were always slow , and advised him to calculate on remaining several months , perhaps a year ; delicately suggesting that his rearing hitherto had been too secluded for his age and rank , and that a year at Paris , even if he failed in the object which took him there , would not be thrown away in the knowledge of men and things that would fit him better to grapple with his difficulties on his return . Alain divided his spare income between his aunt and himself , and had come to Paris resolutely determined to live within the L200 a year which remained to his share . He felt the revolution in his whole being that commenced when out of sight of the petty principality in which he was the object of that feudal reverence , still surviving in the more unfrequented parts of Bretagne , for the representatives of illustrious names connected with the immemorial legends of the province . The very bustle of a railway , with its crowd and quickness and unceremonious democracy of travel , served to pain and confound and humiliate that sense of individual dignity in which he had been nurtured . He felt that , once away from Rochebriant , he was but a cipher in the sum of human beings . Arrived at Paris , and reaching the gloomy hotel to which he had been recommended , he greeted even the desolation of that solitude which is usually so oppressive to a stranger in the metropolis of his native land . Loneliness was better than the loss of self in the reek and pressure of an unfamiliar throng . For the first few days he had wandered over Paris without calling even on the ‘ avoue ’ to whom M. Hebert had directed him . He felt with the instinctive acuteness of a mind which , under sounder training , would have achieved no mean distinction , that it was a safe precaution to imbue himself with the atmosphere of the place , and seize on those general ideas which in great capitals are so contagious that they are often more accurately caught by the first impressions than by subsequent habit , before he brought his mind into collision with those of the individuals he had practically to deal with . At last he repaired to the ‘ avoue , ’ M. Gandrin , Rue St. Florentin . He had mechanically formed his idea of the abode and person of an ‘ avoue ’ from his association with M. Hebert . He expected to find a dull house in a dull street near the centre of business , remote from the haunts of idlers , and a grave man of unpretending exterior and matured years . He arrived at a hotel newly fronted , richly decorated , in the fashionable quartier close by the Tuileries . He entered a wide ‘ porte cochere , ’ and was directed by the concierge to mount ‘ au premier . ’ There , first detained in an office faultlessly neat , with spruce young men at smart desks , he was at length admitted into a noble salon , and into the presence of a gentleman lounging in an easy - chair before a magnificent bureau of ‘ marqueterie , genre Louis Seize , ’ engaged in patting a white curly lapdog , with a pointed nose and a shrill bark . The gentleman rose politely on his entrance , and released the dog , who , after sniffing the Marquis , condescended not to bite . “
10332	10372	10328	10330	Monsieur le Marquis	369	” said M. Gandrin , glancing at the card and the introductory note from M. Hebert , which Alain had sent in , and which lay on the ‘ secretaire ’ beside heaps of letters nicely arranged and labelled , “
10453	10454	10420	10420	he	401	” “
10457	10463	10420	10420	he	401	” said Alain , quietly , “
10485	10486	10487	10487	You	369	” “
10553	10554	10549	10549	traders	1342	” “
10557	10565	10549	10549	traders	1342	” said the Marquis , half rising , “
10582	10583	10574	10574	you	8224	” “
10636	10637	10638	10638	Sir	8224	” “
10675	10708	10714	10716	M. le Marquis	393	” The Marquis said this with naive simplicity , as if his word were quite sufficient to set that part of the question at rest . M. Gandrin smiled politely and said , “
10765	10811	10749	10750	Madame Gandrin	404	” Unprepared for the proffered hospitality , the Marquis had no option but to murmur his gratification and assent . In a minute more he was in the streets . The next evening he went to Madame Gandrin’s,—a brilliant reception,—a whole moving flower - bed of “
10813	11611	11612	11612	cousin	1348	” there . Having gone through the ceremony of presentation to Madame Gandrin,—a handsome woman dressed to perfection , and conversing with the secretary to an embassy,—the young noble ensconced himself in an obscure and quiet corner , observing all and imagining that he escaped observation . And as the young men of his own years glided by him , or as their talk reached his ears , he became aware that from top to toe , within and without , he was old - fashioned , obsolete , not of his race , not of his day . His rank itself seemed to him a waste - paper title - deed to a heritage long lapsed . Not thus the princely seigneurs of Rochebriant made their ‘ debut ’ at the capital of their nation . They had had the ‘ entree ’ to the cabinets of their kings ; they had glittered in the halls of Versailles ; they had held high posts of distinction in court and camp ; the great Order of St. Louis had seemed their hereditary appanage . His father , though a voluntary exile in manhood , had been in childhood a king ’s page , and throughout life remained the associate of princes ; and here , in an ‘ avoue ’s soiree , ’ unknown , unregarded , an expectant on an ‘ avoue ’s ’ patronage , stood the last lord of Rochebriant . It is easy to conceive that Alain did not stay long . But he stayed long enough to convince him that on L200 a year the polite society of Paris , even as seen at M. Gandrin ’s , was not for him . Nevertheless , a day or two after , he resolved to call upon the nearest of his kinsmen to whom his aunt had given him letters . With the Count de Vandemar , one of his fellow - nobles of the sacred Faubourg , he should be no less Rochebriant , whether in a garret or a palace . The Vandemars , in fact , though for many generations before the First Revolution a puissant and brilliant family , had always recognized the Rochebriants as the head of their house,—the trunk from which they had been slipped in the fifteenth century , when a younger son of the Rochebriants married a wealthy heiress and took the title with the lands of Vandemar . Since then the two families had often intermarried . The present count had a reputation for ability , was himself a large proprietor , and might furnish advice to guide Alain in his negotiations with M. Gandrin . The Hotel do Vandemar stood facing the old Hotel de Rochebriant ; it was less spacious , but not less venerable , gloomy , and prison - like . As he turned his eyes from the armorial scutcheon which still rested , though chipped and mouldering , over the portals of his lost ancestral house , and was about to cross the street , two young men , who seemed two or three years older than himself , emerged on horseback from the Hotel de Vandemar . Handsome young men , with the lofty look of the old race , dressed with the punctilious care of person which is not foppery in men of birth , but seems part of the self - respect that appertains to the old chivalric point of honour . The horse of one of these cavaliers made a caracole which brought it nearly upon Alain as he was about to cross . The rider , checking his steed , lifted his hat to Alain and uttered a word of apology in the courtesy of ancient high - breeding , but still with condescension as to an inferior . This little incident , and the slighting kind of notice received from coevals of his own birth , and doubtless his own blood,—for he divined truly that they were the sons of the Count de Vandemar,—disconcerted Alain to a degree which perhaps a Frenchman alone can comprehend . He had even half a mind to give up his visit and turn back . However , his native manhood prevailed over that morbid sensitiveness which , born out of the union of pride and poverty , has all the effects of vanity , and yet is not vanity itself . The Count was at home , a thin spare man with a narrow but high forehead , and an expression of countenance keen , severe , and ‘ un peu moqueuse . ’ He received the Marquis , however , at first with great cordiality , kissed him on both sides of his cheek , called him “
11614	11756	11612	11612	cousin	1348	” expressed immeasurable regret that the Countess was gone out on one of the missions of charity in which the great ladies of the Faubourg religiously interest themselves , and that his sons had just ridden forth to the Bois . As Alain , however , proceeded , simply and without false shame , to communicate the object of his visit at Paris , the extent of his liabilities , and the penury of his means , the smile vanished from the Count ’s face . He somewhat drew back his fauteuil in the movement common to men who wish to estrange themselves from some other man ’s difficulties ; and when Alain came to a close , the Count remained some moments seized with a slight cough ; and , gazing intently on the carpet , at length he said , “
11772	11773	11762	11763	your father	8236	” “
11776	11784	11762	11763	your father	8236	” said the Marquis , colouring high . “
11799	11816	11762	11763	your father	8236	” The Count stared , shrugged his shoulders , and replied with ‘ sang froid , ’ “
11868	11876	11857	11857	you	1263	” Alain bowed his head in assent . “
11889	11910	11857	11857	you	1263	” said the Count , placing the index of the right hand successively on the thumb and three fingers of the left,—“four
11917	12025	11857	11857	you	1263	“ First . To do as your notary recommended : consolidate your mortgages , patch up your income as you best can , return to Rochebriant , and devote the rest of your existence to the preservation of your property . By that course your life will be one of permanent privation , severe struggle ; and the probability is that you will not succeed : there will come one or two bad seasons , the farmers will fail to pay , the mortgagee will foreclose , and you may find yourself , after twenty years of anxiety and torment , prematurely old and without a sou . “
12151	12152	12156	12156	Count	410	” “
12184	12185	12186	12186	Your	1349	” “
12250	12251	12259	12259	me	0	” “
12288	12289	12290	12290	I	0	” “
12378	12379	12369	12369	ministers	1373	” “
12417	12418	12424	12424	my	0	” “
12427	12432	12424	12424	my	0	” said the Count , “
12525	12526	12515	12523	a rich ‘ roturier ’ with an ambitious daughter	1378	” “
12529	12537	12515	12523	a rich ‘ roturier ’ with an ambitious daughter	1378	” said the young man , rising , “
12573	12574	12588	12588	Marquis	351	” “
12715	12796	12799	12799	Count	408	” The old Count said this with a grim ‘ persiflage . ’ He was a Voltairian . Voltairianism , deserted by the modern Liberals of France , has its chief cultivation nowadays among the wits of the old ‘ regime . ’ They pick up its light weapons on the battle - field on which their fathers perished , and re - feather against the ‘ canaille ’ the shafts which had been pointed against the ‘ noblesse . ’ “
12801	12807	12799	12799	Count	408	” said Alain , rising ; “
12828	12829	12835	12836	my cousin	1391	” “
12870	12871	12872	12872	Count	408	” “
12903	12908	12872	12872	Count	408	” The Count hesitated . “
12911	12919	12872	12872	Count	408	” said he at last , frankly ; “
13089	13090	13091	13091	I	0	” “
13115	13140	13109	13113	a relation and a guide	1407	” answered the Marquis , with nobility of mien that was not without a pathos which touched the hard heart of the old man . “
13154	13269	13145	13145	you	408	” and though he did not kiss his cousin ’s cheek this time , he gave him , with more sincerity , a parting shake of the hand . And these made the principal events in Alain ’s Paris life till he met Frederic Lemercier . Hitherto he had received no definite answer from M. Gandrin , who had postponed an interview , not having had leisure to make himself master of all the details in the abstract sent to him . The next day , towards the afternoon , Frederic Lemercier , somewhat breathless from the rapidity at which he had ascended to so high an eminence , burst into Alain ’s chamber . “
13359	13453	13455	13455	Gandrin	402	” To the young Marquis , the gayety , the heartiness of his college friend were a cordial . How different from the dry counsels of the Count de Vandemar ! Hope , though vaguely , entered into his heart . Willingly he accepted Frederic ’s invitation , and the young men were soon rapidly borne along the Champs Elysees . As briefly as he could Alain described the state of his affairs , the nature of his mortgages , and the result of his interview with M. Gandrin . Frederic listened attentively . “
13464	13465	13455	13455	Gandrin	402	” “
13485	13486	13474	13474	him	402	” “
13571	13572	13559	13559	Louvier	399	” “
13587	13588	13577	13578	M. Hebert	401	” “
13613	13636	13607	13611	those young men on horseback	1419	” Alain looked forth and recognized the two cavaliers whom he had conjectured to be the sons of the Count de Vandemar . “
13649	13653	13607	13611	those young men on horseback	1419	” said Frederic ; “
13674	13675	13667	13667	they	1420	” “
13689	13690	13691	13691	Raoul	415	” “
13707	13708	13702	13705	the Count de Vandemar	408	” “
13719	13720	13715	13715	You	1412	” “
13782	13783	13788	13791	nobles of such birth	1429	” “
13804	13805	13812	13812	he	8604	” “
13979	13980	13982	13982	you	1440	” “
14002	14003	13987	13987	you	1440	” “
14064	14065	14059	14059	Pollux	418	” “
14072	14073	14059	14059	Pollux	418	” “
14163	14164	14157	14157	You	1458	” “
14167	14168	14157	14157	You	1458	” “
14192	14193	14185	14185	Coachman	1460	” “
14198	14202	14185	14185	Coachman	1460	” resumed Frederic , “
14323	14548	14587	14587	you	1464	” The coupe stops at the Bourse , our friends mount the steps , glide through the pillars , deposit their canes at a place destined to guard them , and the Marquis follows Frederic up a flight of stairs till he gains the open gallery round a vast hall below . Such a din ! such a clamour ! disputations , wrangling , wrathful . Here Lemercier distinguished some friends , whom he joined for a few minutes . Alain left alone , looked down into the hall . He thought himself in some stormy scene of the First Revolution . An English contested election in the market - place of a borough when the candidates are running close on each other — the result doubtful , passions excited , the whole borough in civil war — is peaceful compared to the scene at the Bourse . Bulls and bears screaming , bawling , gesticulating , as if one were about to strangle the other ; the whole , to an uninitiated eye , a confusion , a Babel , which it seems absolutely impossible to reconcile to the notion of quiet mercantile transactions , the purchase and sale of shares and stocks . As Alain gazed bewildered , he felt himself gently touched , and , looking round , saw the Englishman . “
14553	14558	14587	14587	you	1464	” whispered Mr. Vane . “
14571	14572	14587	14587	you	1464	” “
14581	14582	14583	14583	I	0	” “
14785	14816	14777	14777	he	420	” Alain thought of Raoul and Enguerrand , and blushed to find that what he considered a blot on his countrymen was so familiarly perceptible to a foreigner ’s eye . “
14830	14841	14842	14842	He	8285	” continued the Englishman , with a more thoughtful accent . “
15177	15221	15271	15271	I	0	” Alain listened surprised and struck . He had not given the Englishman credit for the cast of mind which such reflections evinced . Here Lemercier rejoined them , and shook hands with Graham Vane , who , taking him aside , said , “
15246	15247	15248	15248	I	0	” “
15280	15281	15271	15271	I	0	” “
15296	15297	15289	15294	that very good - looking Marquis	1503	” “
15341	15342	15329	15329	I	0	” “
15345	15350	15329	15329	I	0	” said the Englishman ; “
15383	15636	15377	15378	the Marquis	8274	” Meanwhile Alain , again looking down , saw just under him , close by one of the pillars , Lucien Duplessis . He was standing apart from the throng , a small space cleared round himself , and two men who had the air of gentlemen of the ‘ beau monde , ’ with whom he was conferring . Duplessis , thus seen , was not like the Duplessis at the restaurant . It would be difficult to explain what the change was , but it forcibly struck Alain : the air was more dignified , the expression keener ; there was a look of conscious power and command about the man even at that distance ; the intense , concentrated intelligence of his eye , his firm lip , his marked features , his projecting , massive brow , would have impressed a very ordinary observer . In fact , the man was here in his native element ; in the field in which his intellect gloried , commanded , and had signalized itself by successive triumphs . Just thus may be the change in the great orator whom you deemed insignificant in a drawing - room , when you see his crest rise above a reverential audience ; or the great soldier , who was not distinguishable from the subaltern in a peaceful club , could you see him issuing the order to his aids - de - camp amidst the smoke and roar of the battle - field . “
15641	15646	15648	15648	you	351	” said Graham Vane , “
15707	15708	15699	15699	Duplessis	362	” “
15716	15728	15729	15729	Alain	351	” cried Frederic , forgetting his recent lesson in English names . “
15744	15745	15737	15738	an Englishman	1514	” “
15751	15757	15737	15738	an Englishman	1514	” returned Graham , quietly . “
15793	15794	15785	15785	Lemercier	363	” “
15803	15817	15797	15797	you	363	” asked Lemercier , as their carriage took the way to the Bois . “
15864	15865	15851	15853	agents de change	1517	” “
15908	15909	15900	15900	he	1518	” “
15932	15933	15900	15900	he	1518	” “
16103	16346	16567	16567	Lemercier	363	“ Crowds are thus attracted to Paris , resolved to venture a small capital in the hope of a large one ; they live on that capital , not on their income , as gamesters do . There is an idea among us that it is necessary to seem rich in order to become rich . Thus there is a general extravagance and profusion . English milords marvel at our splendour . Those who , while spending their capital as their income , fail in their schemes of fortune , after one , two , three , or four years , vanish . What becomes of them , I know no more than I do what becomes of the old moons . Their place is immediately supplied by new candidates . Paris is thus kept perennially sumptuous and splendid by the gold it engulfs . But then some men succeed,—succeed prodigiously , preternaturally ; they make colossal fortunes , which are magnificently expended . They set an example of show and pomp , which is of course the more contagious because so many men say , ‘ The other day those millionnaires were as poor as we are ; they never economized ; why should we ? ’ Paris is thus doubly enriched,—by the fortunes it swallows up , and by the fortunes it casts up ; the last being always reproductive , and the first never lost except to the individuals . ”
16347	16437	16567	16567	Lemercier	363	“ I understand : but what struck me forcibly at the scene we have left was the number of young men there ; young men whom I should judge by their appearance to be gentlemen , evidently not mere spectators,—eager , anxious , with tablets in their hands . That old or middle - aged men should find a zest in the pursuit of gain I can understand , but youth and avarice seem to me a new combination , which Moliere never divined in his ‘ Avare . ’ ”
16438	16552	16553	16553	Alain	351	“ Young men , especially if young gentlemen , love pleasure ; and pleasure in this city is very dear . This explains why so many young men frequent the Bourse . In the old gaining now suppressed , young men were the majority ; in the days of your chivalrous forefathers it was the young nobles , not the old , who would stake their very mantles and swords on a cast of the die . And , naturally enough , mon cher ; for is not youth the season of hope , and is not hope the goddess of gaming , whether at rouge - et - noir or the Bourse ? ”
16792	16796	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ I believe , ”
16814	16907	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ that Paris is built on a loadstone , and that every Frenchman with some iron globules in his blood is irresistibly attracted towards it . The English never seem to feel for London the passionate devotion that we feel for Paris . On the contrary , the London middle class , the commercialists , the shopkeepers , the clerks , even the superior artisans compelled to do their business in the capital , seem always scheming and pining to have their home out of it , though but in a suburb . ”
16908	16917	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ You have been in London , Frederic ? ”
16918	16934	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ Of course ; it is the mode to visit that dull and hideous metropolis . ”
16935	16964	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ If it be dull and hideous , no wonder the people who are compelled to do business in it seek the pleasures of home out of it . ”
16965	17049	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ It is very droll that though the middle class entirely govern the melancholy Albion , it is the only country in Europe in which the middle class seem to have no amusements ; nay , they legislate against amusement . They have no leisure - day but Sunday ; and on that day they close all their theatres , even their museums and picture - galleries . What amusements there may be in England are for the higher classes and the lowest . ”
17050	17060	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ What are the amusements of the lowest class ? ”
17061	17065	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ Getting drunk . ”
17066	17070	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ Nothing else ? ”
17071	17167	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ Yes . I was taken at night under protection of a policeman to some cabarets , where I found crowds of that class which is the stratum below the working class ; lads who sweep crossings and hold horses , mendicants , and , I was told , thieves , girls whom a servant - maid would not speak to , very merry , dancing quadrilles and waltzes , and regaling themselves on sausages,—the happiest - looking folks I found in all London ; and , I must say , conducting themselves very decently . ”
17168	17171	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ Ah ! ”
17180	17218	17173	17173	Lemercier	363	“ Will you object to a walk in this quiet alley ? I see some one whom I have promised the Englishman to — But heed me , Alain , do n’t fall in love with her . ”
17249	17253	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ beauty - women ”
17258	17263	16798	16798	Lemercier	363	“ beauty - men , ”
17336	17341	17342	17342	Her	1544	“ beauty - women . ”
17496	17504	17506	17507	the Parisian	1109	“ She will return this way soon , ”
17509	17551	17506	17507	the Parisian	1109	“ and we can observe her more attentively and more respectfully thus seated than if we were on foot ; meanwhile , what do you think of her ? Is she French ? is she Italian ? can she be English ? ”
17552	17584	17478	17478	Lemercier	363	“ I should have guessed Italian , judging by the darkness of the hair and the outline of the features ; but do Italians have so delicate a fairness of complexion ? ”
17585	17677	17506	17507	the Parisian	1109	“ Very rarely ; and I should guess her to be French , judging by the intelligence of her expression , the simple neatness of her dress , and by that nameless refinement of air in which a Parisienne excels all the descendants of Eve,—if it were not for her eyes . I never saw a Frenchwoman with eyes of that peculiar shade of blue ; and if a Frenchwoman had such eyes , I flatter myself she would have scarcely allowed us to pass without making some use of them . ”
17678	17686	17688	17688	Alain	351	“ Do you think she is married ? ”
17690	17728	17688	17688	Alain	351	“ I hope so ; for a girl of her age , if comme il faut , can scarcely walk alone in the Bois , and would not have acquired that look so intelligent,—more than intelligent,—so poetic . ”
17729	17755	17757	17757	Alain	351	“ But regard that air of unmistakable distinction ; regard that expression of face,-so pure , so virginal : comme il faut she must be . ”
17841	17846	17848	17848	Lemercier	363	“ Quick , quick ! ”
17856	17862	17848	17848	Lemercier	363	“ we must give chase . ”
17988	17995	17997	17997	Lemercier	363	“ I see a cafe yonder , ”
17999	18020	17997	17997	Lemercier	363	“ let us learn all we can as to the fair unknown , over a sorbet or a petit verre . ”
18324	18332	18334	18334	Lemercier	363	“ It is clear to me now , ”
18346	18405	18334	18334	Lemercier	363	“ that our pearly ange is some Italian singer of repute enough in her own country to have gained already a competence ; and that , perhaps on account of her own health or her friend ’s , she is living quietly here in the expectation of some professional engagement , or the absence of some foreign lover . ”
18406	18414	18416	18416	Alain	351	“ Lover ! do you think that ? ”
18427	18452	18416	18416	Alain	351	“ It is possible enough ; and in that case the Englishman may profit little by the information I have promised to give him . ”
18453	18460	18334	18334	Lemercier	363	“ You have promised the Englishman ? ”
18461	18485	18334	18334	Lemercier	363	“ Do you not remember last night that he described the lady , and said that her face haunted him : and I — ”
18486	18508	18416	18416	Alain	351	“ Ah ! I remember now . What do you know of this Englishman ? He is rich , I suppose . ”
18509	18669	18334	18334	Lemercier	363	“ Yes , I hear he is very rich now ; that an uncle lately left him an enormous sum of money . He was attached to the English Embassy many years ago , which accounts for his good French and his knowledge of Parisian life . He comes to Paris very often , and I have known him some time . Indeed he has intrusted to me a difficult and delicate commission . The English tell me that his father was one of the most eminent members of their Parliament , of ancient birth , very highly connected , but ran out his fortune and died poor ; that our friend had for some years to maintain himself , I fancy , by his pen ; that he is considered very able ; and , now that his uncle has enriched him , likely to enter public life and run a career as distinguished as his father ’s . ”
18670	18679	18681	18682	the Marquis	8274	“ Happy man ! happy are the English , ”
18781	18796	18777	18777	Goethe	433	“ that it is the property of true genius to disturb all settled ideas , ”
19580	19584	19586	19586	he	1626	“ If so , ”
19588	19630	19631	19631	He	1626	“ she would be as foolish as a rose that was jealous of the whiteness of a lily . You would do yourself great wrong , my child , if you tried to vie with the rose in its own colour . ”
19668	19671	19673	19673	Savarin	431	“ Nevertheless , ”
19675	19736	19673	19673	Savarin	431	“ when the lily comes out there will be a furious attack on it , made by the clique that devotes itself to the rose : a lily clique will be formed en revanche , and I foresee a fierce paper war . Do not be frightened at its first outburst : every fame worth having must be fought for . ”
20017	20026	20027	20027	he	1647	“ Quite enough to carry them some day , ”
20034	20071	20027	20027	he	1647	“ And the day may be nearer than the world thinks , when my confreres will be so numerous that they will have to shoot down each other for the sake of cheese to their bread . ”
20381	20555	20372	20372	you	1661	“ Courage ! there is at each step some green gap in the hedgerows , some , soft escape from the stony thoroughfare . Beside the real life expands the ideal life to those who seek it . Droop not , seek it : the ideal life has its sorrows , but it never admits despair ; as on the ear of him who follows the winding course of a stream , the stream ever varies the note of its music,—now loud with the rush of the falls ; now low and calm as it glides by the level marge of smooth banks ; now sighing through the stir of the reeds ; now babbling with a fretful joy as some sudden curve on the shore stays its flight among gleaming pebbles,—so to the soul of the artist is the voice of the art ever fleeting beside and before him . Nature gave thee the bird ’s gift of song : raise the gift into art , and make the art thy companion . “
20569	20682	20701	20704	the queens of song	1669	” See how faithfully I remember , methinks , your very words . But the magic of the words , which I then but dimly understood , was in your smile and in your eye , and the queen - like wave of your hand as if beckoning to a world which lay before you , visible and familiar as your native land . And how devotedly , with what earnestness of passion , I gave myself up to the task of raising my gift into an art ! I thought of nothing else , dreamed of nothing else ; and oh , now sweet to me then were words of praise ! “
20687	20694	20696	20696	you	1668	” at length said the masters , “
20706	20752	20698	20698	your	1668	” Then — then — I would have changed for no other throne on earth my hope of that to be achieved in the realms of my art . And then came that long fever : my strength broke down , and the Maestro said , “
20768	20787	20790	20790	you	1668	” How hateful that rest seemed to me ! You again came to my aid . You said , “
20859	21083	21084	21084	You	1673	” So , then , you allured me to a new study . Ah ! in so doing did you dream that you diverted me from the old ambition ? My knowledge of French and Italian , and my rearing in childhood , which had made English familiar to me , gave me the keys to the treasure - houses of three languages . Naturally I began with that in which your masterpieces are composed . Till then I had not even read your works . They were the first I chose . How they impressed , how they startled me ! what depths in the mind of man , in the heart of woman , they revealed to me ! But I owned to you then , and I repeat it now , neither they nor any of the works in romance and poetry which form the boast of recent French literature satisfied yearnings for that calm sense of beauty , that divine joy in a world beyond this world , which you had led me to believe it was the prerogative of ideal art to bestow . And when I told you this with the rude frankness you had bid me exercise in talk with you , a thoughtful , melancholy shade fell over your face , and you said quietly , “
21184	21199	22573	22573	you	1682	” And the next day you brought me ‘ l’asso ’s great poem , the “
21203	21209	22573	22573	you	1682	” and said , smiling , “
21217	21408	22573	22573	you	1682	” You remember that I was then at Sorrento by the order of my physician . Never shall I forget the soft autumn day when I sat amongst the lonely rocklets to the left of the town,—the sea before me , with scarce a ripple ; my very heart steeped in the melodies of that poem , so marvellous for a strength disguised in sweetness , and for a symmetry in which each proportion blends into the other with the perfectness of a Grecian statue . The whole place seemed to me filled with the presence of the poet to whom it had given birth . Certainly the reading of that poem formed an era in my existence : to this day I can not acknowledge the faults or weaknesses which your criticisms pointed out ; I believe because they are in unison with my own nature , which yearns for harmony , and , finding that , rests contented . I shrink from violent contrasts , and can discover nothing tame and insipid in a continuance of sweetness and serenity . But it was not till after I had read “
21411	21469	22573	22573	you	1682	” again and again , and then sat and brooded over it , that I recognized the main charm of the poem in the religion which clings to it as the perfume clings to a flower,—a religion sometimes melancholy , but never to me sad . Hope always pervades it . Surely if , as you said , “
21478	21616	22573	22573	you	1682	” it is because art at its highest blends itself unconsciously with religion , and proclaims its affinity with hope by its faith in some future good more perfect than it has realized in the past . Be this as it may , it was in this poem so pre - eminently Christian that I found the something which I missed and craved for in modern French masterpieces ; even yours,—a something spiritual , speaking to my own soul , calling it forth ; distinguishing it as an essence apart from mere human reason ; soothing , even when it excited ; making earth nearer to heaven . And when I ran on in this strain to you after my own wild fashion , you took my head between your hands and kissed me , and said , “
21630	21857	22573	22573	you	1682	” Why did I not feel in Dante the Christian charm that I felt in Tasso ? Dante in your eyes , as in those of most judges , is infinitely the greater genius ; but reflected on the dark stream of that genius the stars are so troubled , the heaven so threatening . Just as my year of holiday was expiring , I turned to English literature ; and Shakspeare , of course , was the first English poet put into my hands . It proves how childlike my mind still was , that my earliest sensation in reading him was that of disappointment . It was not only that , despite my familiarity with English ( thanks chiefly to the care of him whom I call my second father ) , there is much in the metaphorical diction of Shakspeare which I failed to comprehend ; but he seemed to me so far like the modern French writers who affect to have found inspiration in his muse , that he obtrudes images of pain and suffering without cause or motive sufficiently clear to ordinary understandings , as I had taught myself to think it ought to be in the drama . He makes Fate so cruel that we lose sight of the mild deity behind her . Compare , in this , Corneille ’s “
21860	21863	22573	22573	you	1682	” with the “
21866	21962	22573	22573	you	1682	” In the first an equal calamity befalls the good , but in their calamity they are blessed . The death of the martyr is the triumph of his creed . But when we have put down the English tragedy,—when Hamlet and Ophelia are confounded in death with Polonius and the fratricidal king , we see not what good end for humanity is achieved . The passages that fasten on our memory do not make us happier and holier : they suggest but terrible problems , to which they give us no solution . In the “
21964	22044	22573	22573	you	1682	” of Corneille there are fierce contests , rude passions , tears drawn from some of the bitterest sources of human pity ; but then through all stands out , large and visible to the eyes of all spectators , the great ideal of devoted patriotism . How much of all that has been grandest in the life of France , redeeming even its worst crimes of revolution in the love of country , has had its origin in the “
22046	22544	22573	22573	you	1682	” of Corneille . But I doubt if the fates of Coriolanus and Caesar and Brutus and Antony , in the giant tragedies of Shakspeare , have made Englishmen more willing to die for England . In fine , it was long before — I will not say I understood or rightly appreciated Shakspeare , for no Englishman would admit that I or even you could ever do so , but before I could recognize the justice of the place his country claims for him as the genius without an equal in the literature of Europe . Meanwhile the ardour I had put into study , and the wear and tear of the emotions which the study called forth , made themselves felt in a return of my former illness , with symptoms still more alarming ; and when the year was out I was ordained to rest for perhaps another year before I could sing in public , still less appear on the stage . How I rejoiced when I heard that fiat ! for I emerged from that year of study with a heart utterly estranged from the profession in which I had centred my hopes before — Yes , Eulalie , you had bid me accomplish myself for the arts of utterance ; by the study of arts in which thoughts originate the words they employ ; and in doing so I had changed myself into another being . I was forbidden all fatigue of mind : my books were banished , but not the new self which the books had formed . Recovering slowly through the summer , I came hither two months since , ostensibly for the advice of Dr. C———- , but really in the desire to commune with my own heart and be still . And now I have poured forth that heart to you , would you persuade me still to be a singer ? If you do , remember at least how jealous and absorbing the art of the singer and the actress is,—how completely I must surrender myself to it , and live among books or among dreams no more . Can I be anything else but singer ? and if not , should I be contented merely to read and to dream ? I must confide to you one ambition which during the lazy Italian summer took possession of me ; I must tell you the ambition , and add that I have renounced it as a vain one . I had hoped that I could compose , I mean in music . I was pleased with some things I did : they expressed in music what I could not express in words ; and one secret object in coming here was to submit them to the great Maestro . He listened to them patiently : he complimented me on my accuracy in the mechanical laws of composition ; he even said that my favourite airs were “
22549	22567	22573	22573	you	1682	” And so he would have left me , but I stopped him timidly , and said , “
22594	22595	22596	22596	You	1682	” “
22603	22604	22599	22601	a professional composer	1684	” “
22609	22610	22599	22601	a professional composer	1684	” “
22622	22623	22599	22601	a professional composer	1684	” “
22626	22627	22599	22601	a professional composer	1684	” “
22813	23416	22811	22811	femme	1694	” He left me , of course , mortified and humbled ; but I feel he is right as regards myself , though whether in his depreciation of our whole sex I can not say . But as this hope has left me , I have become more disquieted , still more restless . Counsel me , Eulalie ; counsel , and , if possible , comfort me . ISAURA . FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME . No letter from you yet , and I have left you in peace for ten days . How do you think I have spent them ? The Maestro called on us with M. Savarin , to insist on our accompanying them on a round of the theatres . I had not been to one since my arrival . I divined that the kind - hearted composer had a motive in this invitation . He thought that in witnessing the applauses bestowed on actors , and sharing in the fascination in which theatrical illusion holds an audience , my old passion for the stage , and with it the longing for an artiste ’s fame , would revive . In my heart I wished that his expectations might be realized . Well for me if I could once more concentrate all my aspirations on a prize within my reach ! We went first to see a comedy greatly in vogue , and the author thoroughly understands the French stage of our day . The acting was excellent in its way . The next night we went to the Odeon , a romantic melodrama in six acts , and I know not how many tableaux . I found no fault with the acting there . I do not give you the rest of our programme . We visited all the principal theatres , reserving the opera and Madame S — — — for the last . Before I speak of the opera , let me say a word or two on the plays . There is no country in which the theatre has so great a hold on the public as in France ; no country in which the successful dramatist has so high a fame ; no country perhaps in which the state of the stage so faithfully represents the moral and intellectual condition of the people . I say this not , of course , from my experience of countries which I have not visited , but from all I hear of the stage in Germany and in England . The impression left on my mind by the performances I witnessed is , that the French people are becoming dwarfed . The comedies that please them are but pleasant caricatures of petty sections in a corrupt society . They contain no large types of human nature ; their witticisms convey no luminous flashes of truth ; their sentiment is not pure and noble,—it is a sickly and false perversion of the impure and ignoble into travesties of the pure and noble . Their melodramas can not be classed as literature : all that really remains of the old French genius is its vaudeville . Great dramatists create great parts . One great part , such as a Rachel would gladly have accepted , I have not seen in the dramas of the young generation . High art has taken refuge in the opera ; but that is not French opera . I do not complain so much that French taste is less refined . I complain that French intellect is lowered . The descent from “
23418	23420	22811	22811	femme	1694	” to “
23423	23446	22811	22811	femme	1694	” is great , not so much in the poetry of form as in the elevation of thought ; but the descent from “
23449	23789	22811	22811	femme	1694	” to the best drama now produced is out of poetry altogether , and into those flats of prose which give not even the glimpse of a mountain - top . But now to the opera . S — — — in Norma ! The house was crowded , and its enthusiasm as loud as it was genuine . You tell me that S — — — never rivalled Pasta , but certainly her Norma is a great performance . Her voice has lost less of its freshness than I had been told , and what is lost of it her practised management conceals or carries off . The Maestro was quite right : I could never vie with her in her own line ; but conceited and vain as I may seem even to you in saying so , I feel in my own line that I could command as large an applause,—of course taking into account my brief - lived advantage of youth . Her acting , apart from her voice , does not please me . It seems to me to want intelligence of the subtler feelings , the under - current of emotion which constitutes the chief beauty of the situation and the character . Am I jealous when I say this ? Read on and judge . On our return that night , when I had seen the Venosta to bed , I went into my own room , opened the window , and looked out . A lovely night , mild as in spring at Florence,—the moon at her full , and the stars looking so calm and so high beyond our reach of their tranquillity . The evergreens in the gardens of the villas around me silvered over , and the summer boughs , not yet clothed with leaves , were scarcely visible amid the changeless smile of the laurels . At the distance lay Paris , only to be known by its innumerable lights . And then I said to myself , “
23850	24781	24782	24782	Mademoiselle	383	” Then I gazed on those stars which provoke our questionings , and return no answer , till my heart grew full,—so full,—and I bowed my head and wept like a child . FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME . And still no letter from you ! I see in the journals that you have left Nice . Is it that you are too absorbed in your work to have leisure to write to me ? I know you are not ill , for if you were , all Paris would know of it . All Europe has an interest in your health . Positively I will write to you no more till a word from yourself bids me do so . I fear I must give up my solitary walks in the Bois de Boulogne : they were very dear to me , partly because the quiet path to which I confined myself was that to which you directed me as the one you habitually selected when at Paris , and in which you had brooded over and revolved the loveliest of your romances ; and partly because it was there that , catching , alas ! not inspiration but enthusiasm from the genius that had hallowed the place , and dreaming I might originate music , I nursed my own aspirations and murmured my own airs . And though so close to that world of Paris to which all artists must appeal for judgment or audience , the spot was so undisturbed , so sequestered . But of late that path has lost its solitude , and therefore its charm . Six days ago the first person I encountered in my walk was a man whom I did not then heed . He seemed in thought , or rather in revery , like myself ; we passed each other twice or thrice , and I did not notice whether he was young or old , tall or short ; but he came the next day , and a third day , and then I saw that he was young , and , in so regarding him , his eyes became fixed on mine . The fourth day he did not come , but two other men came , and the look of one was inquisitive and offensive . They sat themselves down on a bench in the walk , and though I did not seem to notice them , I hastened home ; and the next day , in talking with our kind Madame Savarin , and alluding to these quiet walks of mine , she hinted , with the delicacy which is her characteristic , that the customs of Paris did not allow demoiselles comme il faut to walk alone even in the most sequestered paths of the Bois . I begin now to comprehend your disdain of customs which impose chains so idly galling on the liberty of our sex . We dined with the Savarins last evening : what a joyous nature he has ! Not reading Latin , I only know Horace by translations , which I am told are bad ; but Savarin seems to me a sort of half Horace,—Horace on his town - bred side , so playfully well - bred , so good - humoured in his philosophy , so affectionate to friends , and so biting to foes . But certainly Savarin could not have lived in a country farm upon endives and mallows . He is town - bred and Parisian , jusqu’au bout des ongles . How he admires you , and how I love him for it ! Only in one thing he disappoints me there . It is your style that he chiefly praises : certainly that style is matchless ; but style is only the clothing of thought , and to praise your style seems to me almost as invidious as the compliment to some perfect beauty , not on her form and face , but on her taste and dress . We met at dinner an American and his wife,—a Colonel and Mrs. Morley : she is delicately handsome , as the American women I have seen generally are , and with that frank vivacity of manner which distinguishes them from English women . She seemed to take a fancy to me , and we soon grew very good friends . She is the first advocate I have met , except yourself , of that doctrine upon the rights of Women , of which one reads more in the journals than one hears discussed in salons . Naturally enough I felt great interest in that subject , more especially since my rambles in the Bois were forbidden ; and as long as she declaimed on the hard fate of the women who , feeling within them powers that struggle for air and light beyond the close precinct of household duties , find themselves restricted from fair rivalry with men in such fields of knowledge and toil and glory as men since the world began have appropriated to themselves , I need not say that I went with her cordially : you can guess that by my former letters . But when she entered into the detailed catalogue of our exact wrongs and our exact rights , I felt all the pusillanimity of my sex and shrank back in terror . Her husband , joining us when she was in full tide of eloquence , smiled at me with a kind of saturnine mirth . “
24833	25531	24789	24789	she	1698	” Upon this there was a lively battle of words between the spouses , in which , I must own , I thought the lady was decidedly worsted . No , Eulalie , I see nothing in these schemes for altering our relations towards the other sex which would improve our condition . The inequalities we suffer are not imposed by law,—not even by convention : they are imposed by nature . Eulalie , you have had an experience unknown to me : you have loved . In that day did you,—you , round whom poets and sages and statesmen gather , listening to your words as to an oracle,—did you feel that your pride of genius had gone out from you , that your ambition lived in whom you loved , that his smile was more to you than the applause of a world ? I feel as if love in a woman must destroy her rights of equality , that it gives to her a sovereign even in one who would be inferior to herself if her love did not glorify and crown him . Ah ! if I could but merge this terrible egotism which oppresses me , into the being of some one who is what I would wish to be were I man ! I would not ask him to achieve fame . Enough if I felt that he was worthy of it , and happier methinks to console him when he failed than to triumph with him when he won . Tell me , have you felt this ? When you loved did you stoop as to a slave , or did you bow down as to a master ? FROM MADAME DE GRANTMESNIL TO ISAURA CICOGNA . Chere enfant,—All your four letters have reached me the same day . In one of my sudden whims I set off with a few friends on a rapid tour along the Riviera to Genoa , thence to Turin on to Milan . Not knowing where we should rest even for a day , my letters were not forwarded . I came back to Nice yesterday , consoled for all fatigues in having insured that accuracy in description of localities which my work necessitates . You are , my poor child , in that revolutionary crisis through which genius passes in youth before it knows its own self , and longs vaguely to do or to be a something other than it has done or has been before . For , not to be unjust to your own powers , genius you have,—that inborn undefinable essence , including talent , and yet distinct from it . Genius you have , but genius unconcentrated , undisciplined . I see , though you are too diffident to say so openly , that you shrink from the fame of singer , because , fevered by your reading , you would fain aspire to the thorny crown of author . I echo the hard saying of the Maestro : I should be your worst enemy did I encourage you to forsake a career in which a dazzling success is so assured , for one in which , if it were your true vocation , you would not ask whether you were fit for it ; you would be impelled to it by the terrible star which presides over the birth of poets . Have you , who are so naturally observant , and of late have become so reflective , never remarked that authors , however absorbed in their own craft , do not wish their children to adopt it ? The most successful author is perhaps the last person to whom neophytes should come for encouragement . This I think is not the case with the cultivators of the sister arts . The painter , the sculptor , the musician , seem disposed to invite disciples and welcome acolytes . As for those engaged in the practical affairs of life , fathers mostly wish their sons to be as they have been . The politician , the lawyer , the merchant , each says to his children , “
25536	25590	24789	24789	she	1698	” All parents in practical life would at least agree in this,—they would not wish their sons to be poets . There must be some sound cause in the world ’s philosophy for this general concurrence of digression from a road of which the travellers themselves say to those whom they love best , “
25593	26157	24789	24789	she	1698	” Romance in youth is , if rightly understood , the happiest nutriment of wisdom in after - years ; but I would never invite any one to look upon the romance of youth as a thing Enfant , have you need of a publisher to create romance ? Is it not in yourself ? Do not imagine that genius requires for its enjoyment the scratch of the pen and the types of the printer . Do not suppose that the poet , the romancier , is most poetic , most romantic , when he is striving , struggling , labouring , to check the rush of his ideas , and materialize the images which visit him as souls into such tangible likenesses of flesh and blood that the highest compliment a reader can bestow on them is to say that they are lifelike : No : the poet ’s real delight is not in the mechanism of composing ; the best part of that delight is in the sympathies he has established with innumerable modifications of life and form , and art and Nature , sympathies which are often found equally keen in those who have not the same gift of language . The poet is but the interpreter . What of?—Truths in the hearts of others . He utters what they feel . Is the joy in the utterance ? Nay , it is in the feeling itself . So , my dear , dark - bright child of song , when I bade thee open , out of the beaten thoroughfare , paths into the meads and river - banks at either side of the formal hedgerows , rightly dost thou add that I enjoined thee to make thine art thy companion . In the culture of that art for which you are so eminently gifted , you will find the ideal life ever beside the real . Are you not ashamed to tell me that in that art you do but utter the thoughts of others ? You utter them in music ; through the music you not only give to the thoughts a new character , but you make them reproductive of fresh thoughts in your audience . You said very truly that you found in composing you could put into music thoughts which you could not put into words . That is the peculiar distinction of music . No genuine musician can explain in words exactly what he means to convey in his music . How little a libretto interprets an opera ; how little we care even to read it ! It is the music that speaks to us ; and how?—Through the human voice . We do not notice how poor are the words which the voice warbles . It is the voice itself interpreting the soul of the musician which enchants and enthralls us . And you who have that voice pretend to despise the gift . What ! despise the power of communicating delight!—the power that we authors envy ; and rarely , if ever , can we give delight with so little alloy as the singer . And when an audience disperses , can you guess what griefs the singer may have comforted ? what hard hearts he may have softened ? what high thoughts he may have awakened ? You say , “
26176	26180	24789	24789	she	1698	” I say , “
26213	26316	24789	24789	she	1698	” There , have I scolded you sufficiently ? I should scold you more , if I did not see in the affluence of your youth and your intellect the cause of your restlessness . Riches are always restless . It is only to poverty that the gods give content . You question me about love ; you ask if I have ever bowed to a master , ever merged my life in another ’s : expect no answer on this from me . Circe herself could give no answer to the simplest maid , who , never having loved , asks , “
26321	26371	24789	24789	she	1698	” In the history of the passions each human heart is a world in itself ; its experience profits no others . In no two lives does love play the same part or bequeath the same record . I know not whether I am glad or sorry that the word “
26373	26658	24789	24789	she	1698	” now falls on my ear with a sound as slight and as faint as the dropping of a leaf in autumn may fall on thine . I volunteer but this lesson , the wisest I can give , if thou canst understand it : as I bade thee take art into thy life , so learn to look on life itself as an art . Thou couldst discover the charm in Tasso ; thou couldst perceive that the requisite of all art , that which pleases , is in the harmony of proportion . We lose sight of beauty if we exaggerate the feature most beautiful . Love proportioned adorns the homeliest existence ; love disproportioned deforms the fairest . Alas ! wilt thou remember this warning when the time comes in which it may be needed ? E——- G———- . It is several weeks after the date of the last chapter ; the lime - trees in the Tuileries are clothed in green . In a somewhat spacious apartment on the ground - floor in the quiet locality of the Rue d’Anjou , a man was seated , very still and evidently absorbed in deep thought , before a writing - table placed close to the window . Seen thus , there was an expression of great power both of intellect and of character in a face which , in ordinary social commune , might rather be noticeable for an aspect of hardy frankness , suiting well with the clear - cut , handsome profile , and the rich dark auburn hair , waving carelessly over one of those broad open foreheads , which , according to an old writer , seem the “
26667	27303	24789	24789	she	1698	” The forehead , indeed , was the man ’s most remarkable feature . It could not but prepossess the beholder . When , in private theatricals , he had need to alter the character of his countenance , he did it effectually , merely by forcing down his hair till it reached his eyebrows . He no longer then looked like the same man . The person I describe has been already introduced to the reader as Graham Vane . But perhaps this is the fit occasion to enter into some such details as to his parentage and position as may make the introduction more satisfactory and complete . His father , the representative of a very ancient family , came into possession , after a long minority , of what may be called a fair squire ’s estate , and about half a million in moneyed investments , inherited on the female side . Both land and money were absolutely at his disposal , unencumbered by entail or settlement . He was a man of a brilliant , irregular genius , of princely generosity , of splendid taste , of a gorgeous kind of pride closely allied to a masculine kind of vanity . As soon as he was of age he began to build , converting his squire ’s hall into a ducal palace . He then stood for the county ; and in days before the first Reform Bill , when a county election was to the estate of a candidate what a long war is to the debt of a nation . He won the election ; he obtained early successes in Parliament . It was said by good authorities in political circles that , if he chose , he might aspire to lead his party , and ultimately to hold the first rank in the government of his country . That may or may not be true ; but certainly he did not choose to take the trouble necessary for such an ambition . He was too fond of pleasure , of luxury , of pomp . He kept a famous stud of racers and hunters . He was a munificent patron of art . His establishments , his entertainments , were on a par with those of the great noble who represented the loftiest ( Mr. Vane would not own it to be the eldest ) branch of his genealogical tree . He became indifferent to political contests , indolent in his attendance at the House , speaking seldom , not at great length nor with much preparation , but with power and fire , originality and genius ; so that he was not only effective as an orator , but combining with eloquence advantages of birth , person , station , the reputation of patriotic independence , and genial attributes of character , he was an authority of weight in the scales of party . This gentleman , at the age of forty , married the dowerless daughter of a poor but distinguished naval officer , of noble family , first cousin to the Duke of Alton . He settled on her a suitable jointure , but declined to tie up any portion of his property for the benefit of children by the marriage . He declared that so much of his fortune was invested either in mines , the produce of which was extremely fluctuating , or in various funds , over rapid transfers in which it was his amusement and his interest to have control , unchecked by reference to trustees , that entails and settlements on children were an inconvenience he declined to incur . Besides , he held notions of his own as to the wisdom of keeping children dependent on their father . “
27310	27314	24789	24789	she	1698	” said he , “
27356	27632	27354	27354	usurers	1708	” These arguments might not have prevailed over the bride ’s father a year or two later , when , by the death of intervening kinsmen , he became Duke of Alton ; but in his then circumstances the marriage itself was so much beyond the expectations which the portionless daughter of a sea - captain has the right to form that Mr. Vane had it all his own way , and he remained absolute master of his whole fortune , save of that part of his landed estate on which his wife ’s jointure was settled ; and even from this incumbrance he was very soon freed . His wife died in the second year of marriage , leaving an only son,—Graham . He grieved for her loss with all the passion of an impressionable , ardent , and powerful nature . Then for a while he sought distraction to his sorrow by throwing himself into public life with a devoted energy he had not previously displayed . His speeches served to bring his party into power , and he yielded , though reluctantly , to the unanimous demand of that party that he should accept one of the highest offices in the new Cabinet . He acquitted himself well as an administrator , but declared , no doubt honestly , that he felt like Sinbad released from the old man on his back , when , a year or two afterwards , he went out of office with his party . No persuasions could induce him to come in again ; nor did he ever again take a very active part in debate . “
27635	27639	27354	27354	usurers	1708	” said he , “
27685	28275	27663	27663	I	0	” There he kept his word . Graham had been carefully educated for public life , the ambition for it dinned into his ear from childhood . In his school vacations his father made him learn and declaim chosen specimens of masculine oratory ; engaged an eminent actor to give him lessons in elocution ; bade him frequent theatres , and study there the effect which words derive from looks and gesture ; encouraged him to take part himself in private theatricals . To all this the boy lent his mind with delight . He had the orator ’s inborn temperament ; quick , yet imaginative , and loving the sport of rivalry and contest . Being also , in his boyish years , good - humoured and joyous , he was not more a favourite with the masters in the schoolroom than with the boys in the play - ground . Leaving Eton at seventeen , he then entered at Cambridge , and became , in his first term , the most popular speaker at the Union . But his father cut short his academical career , and decided , for reasons of his own , to place him at once in diplomacy . He was attached to the Embassy at Paris , and partook of the pleasures and dissipations of that metropolis too keenly to retain much of the sterner ambition to which he had before devoted himself . Becoming one of the spoiled darlings of fashion , there was great danger that his character would relax into the easy grace of the Epicurean , when all such loiterings in the Rose Garden were brought to abrupt close by a rude and terrible change in his fortunes . His father was killed by a fall from his horse in hunting ; and when his affairs were investigated , they were found to be hopelessly involved : apparently the assets would not suffice for the debts . The elder Vane himself was probably not aware of the extent of his liabilities . He had never wanted ready money to the last . He could always obtain that from a money - lender , or from the sale of his funded investments . But it became obvious , on examining his papers , that he knew at least how impaired would be the heritage he should bequeath to a son whom he idolized . For that reason he had given Graham a profession in diplomacy , and for that reason he had privately applied to the Ministry for the Viceroyalty of India , in the event of its speedy vacancy . He was eminent enough not to anticipate refusal , and with economy in that lucrative post much of his pecuniary difficulties might have been redeemed , and at least an independent provision secured for his son . Graham , like Alain de Rochebriant , allowed no reproach on his father ’s memory ; indeed , with more reason than Alain , for the elder Vane ’s fortune had at least gone on no mean and frivolous dissipation . It had lavished itself on encouragement to art , on great objects of public beneficence , on public - spirited aid of political objects ; and even in more selfish enjoyments there was a certain grandeur in his princely hospitalities , in his munificent generosity , in a warm - hearted carelessness for money . No indulgence in petty follies or degrading vices aggravated the offence of the magnificent squanderer . “
28290	28296	28277	28277	me	0	” said Graham , manfully . “
28337	28365	28366	28368	the blameless King	1715	” The man to whom he said this was an uncle - in - law,—if I may use that phrase,—the Right Hon . Richard King , popularly styled “
28370	28800	28801	28803	the blameless King	1715	” This gentleman had married the sister of Graham ’s mother , whose loss in his infancy and boyhood she had tenderly and anxiously sought to supply . It is impossible to conceive a woman more fitted to invite love and reverence than was Lady Janet King , her manners were so sweet and gentle , her whole nature so elevated and pure . Her father had succeeded to the dukedom when she married Mr. King , and the alliance was not deemed quite suitable . Still it was not one to which the Duke would have been fairly justified in refusing his assent . Mr. King could not indeed boast of noble ancestry , nor was even a landed proprietor ; but he was a not - undistinguished member of Parliament , of irreproachable character , and ample fortune inherited from a distant kinsman , who had enriched himself as a merchant . It was on both sides a marriage of love . It is popularly said that a man uplifts a wife to his own rank : it as often happens that a woman uplifts her husband to the dignity of her own character . Richard King rose greatly in public estimation after his marriage with Lady Janet . She united to a sincere piety a very active and a very enlightened benevolence . She guided his ambition aside from mere party politics into subjects of social and religious interest , and in devoting himself to these he achieved a position more popular and more respected than he could ever have won in the strife of party . When the Government of which the elder Vane became a leading Minister was formed , it was considered a great object to secure a name as high in the religious world , so beloved by the working classes , as that of Richard King ; and he accepted one of those places which , though not in the cabinet , confers the rank of Privy Councillor . When that brief - lived Administration ceased , he felt the same sensation of relief that Vane had felt , and came to the same resolution never again to accept office , but from different reasons , all of which need not now be detailed . Amongst them , however , certainly this : he was exceedingly sensitive to opinion , thin - skinned as to abuse , and very tenacious of the respect due to his peculiar character of sanctity and philanthropy . He writhed under every newspaper article that had made “
28804	29061	28801	28803	the blameless King	1715	” responsible for the iniquities of the Government to which he belonged . In the loss of office he seemed to recover his former throne . Mr. King heard Graham ’s resolution with a grave approving smile , and his interest in the young man became greatly increased . He devoted himself strenuously to the object of saving to Graham some wrecks of his paternal fortunes , and having a clear head and great experience in the transaction of business , he succeeded beyond the most sanguine expectations formed by the family solicitor . A rich manufacturer was found to purchase at a fancy price the bulk of the estate with the palatial mansion , which the estate alone could never have sufficed to maintain with suitable establishments . So that when all debts were paid , Graham found himself in possession of a clear income of about L500 a year , invested in a mortgage secured on a part of the hereditary lands , on which was seated an old hunting - lodge bought by a brewer . With this portion of the property Graham parted very reluctantly . It was situated amid the most picturesque scenery on the estate , and the lodge itself was a remnant of the original residence of his ancestors before it had been abandoned for that which , built in the reign of Elizabeth , had been expanded into a Trenthain - like palace by the last owner . But Mr. King ’s argument reconciled him to the sacrifice . “
29066	29072	28801	28803	the blameless King	1715	” said the prudent adviser , “
29259	29671	29672	29672	I	0	” Graham was convinced , and yielded , though with a bitter pang . It is hard for a man whose fathers have lived on the soil to give up all trace of their whereabouts . But none saw in him any morbid consciousness of change of fortune , when , a year after his father ’s death , he reassumed his place in society . If before courted for his expectations , he was still courted for himself ; by many of the great who had loved his father , perhaps even courted more . He resigned the diplomatic career , not merely because the rise in that profession is slow , and in the intermediate steps the chances of distinction are slight and few , but more because he desired to cast his lot in the home country , and regarded the courts of other lands as exile . It was not true , however , as Lemercier had stated on report , that he lived on his pen . Curbing all his old extravagant tastes , L500 a year amply supplied his wants . But he had by his pen gained distinction , and created great belief in his abilities for a public career . He had written critical articles , read with much praise , in periodicals of authority , and had published one or two essays on political questions which had created yet more sensation . It was only the graver literature , connected more or less with his ultimate object of a public career , in which he had thus evinced his talents of composition . Such writings were not of a nature to bring him much money , but they gave him a definite and solid station . In the old time , before the first Reform Bill , his reputation would have secured him at once a seat in Parliament ; but the ancient nurseries of statesmen are gone , and their place is not supplied . He had been invited , however , to stand for more than one large and populous borough , with very fair prospects of success ; and , whatever the expense , Mr. King had offered to defray it . But Graham would not have incurred the latter obligation ; and when he learned the pledges which his supporters would have exacted , he would not have stood if success had been certain and the cost nothing . “
29676	29683	29672	29672	I	0	” he said to his friends , “
29742	29776	29777	29777	He	0	” Three years went by , passed chiefly in England , partly in travel ; and at the age of thirty , Graham Vane was still one of those of whom admirers say , “
29786	29791	29777	29777	He	0	” and detractors reply , “
29800	30711	30713	30713	he	1734	” The same fastidiousness which had operated against that entrance into Parliament , to which his ambition not the less steadily adapted itself , had kept him free from the perils of wedlock . In his heart he yearned for love and domestic life , but he had hitherto met with no one who realized the ideal he had formed . With his person , his accomplishments , his connections , and his repute , he might have made many an advantageous marriage . But somehow or other the charm vanished from a fair face , if the shadow of a money - bag fell on it ; on the other hand , his ambition occupied so large a share in his thoughts that he would have fled in time from the temptation of a marriage that would have overweighted him beyond the chance of rising . Added to all , he desired in a wife an intellect that , if not equal to his own , could become so by sympathy,—a union of high culture and noble aspiration , and yet of loving womanly sweetness which a man seldom finds out of books ; and when he does find it , perhaps it does not wear the sort of face that he fancies . Be that as it may , Graham was still unmarried and heart - whole . And now a new change in his life befell him . Lady Janet died of a fever contracted in her habitual rounds of charity among the houses of the poor . She had been to him as the most tender mother , and a lovelier soul than hers never alighted on the earth . His grief was intense ; but what was her husband’s?—one of those griefs that kill . To the side of Richard King his Janet had been as the guardian angel . His love for her was almost worship : with her , every object in a life hitherto so active and useful seemed gone . He evinced no noisy passion of sorrow . He shut himself up , and refused to see even Graham . But after some weeks had passed , he admitted the clergyman in whom on spiritual matters he habitually confided , and seemed consoled by the visits ; then he sent for his lawyer and made his will ; after which he allowed Graham to call on him daily , on the condition that there should be no reference to his loss . He spoke to the young man on other subjects , rather drawing him out about himself , sounding his opinion on various grave matters , watching his face while he questioned , as if seeking to dive into his heart , and sometimes pathetically sinking into silence , broken but by sighs . So it went on for a few more weeks ; then he took the advice of his physician to seek change of air and scene . He went away alone , without even a servant , not leaving word where he had gone . After a little while he returned , more ailing , more broken than before . One morning he was found insensible,—stricken by paralysis . He regained consciousness , and even for some days rallied strength . He might have recovered , but he seemed as if he tacitly refused to live . He expired at last , peacefully , in Graham ’s arms . At the opening of his will it was found that he had left Graham his sole heir and executor . Deducting government duties , legacies to servants , and donations to public charities , the sum thus bequeathed to his lost wife ’s nephew was two hundred and twenty thousand pounds . With such a fortune , opening indeed was made for an ambition so long obstructed . But Graham affected no change in his mode of life ; he still retained his modest bachelor ’s apartments , engaged no servants , bought no horses , in no way exceeded the income he had possessed before . He seemed , indeed , depressed rather than elated by the succession to a wealth which he had never anticipated . Two children had been born from the marriage of Richard King : they had died young , it is true , but Lady Janet at the time of her own decease was not too advanced in years for the reasonable expectation of other offspring ; and even after Richard King became a widower , he had given to Graham no hint of his testamentary dispositions . The young man was no blood - relation to him , and naturally supposed that such relations would become the heirs . But in truth the deceased seemed to have no blood - relations : none had ever been known to visit him ; none raised a voice to question the justice of his will . Lady Janet had been buried at Kensal Green ; her husband ’s remains were placed in the same vault . For days and days Graham went his way lonelily to the cemetery . He might be seen standing motionless by that tomb , with tears rolling down his cheeks ; yet his was not a weak nature,—not one of those that love indulgence of irremediable grief . On the contrary , people who did not know him well said “
30720	31088	30713	30713	he	1734	” and the character of his pursuits , as of his writings , was certainly not that of a sentimentalist . He had not thus visited the tomb till Richard King had been placed within it . Yet his love for his aunt was unspeakably greater than that which he could have felt for her husband . Was it , then , the husband that he so much more acutely mourned ; or was there something that , since the husband ’s death , had deepened his reverence for the memory of her whom he had not only loved as a mother , but honoured as a saint ? These visits to the cemetery did not cease till Graham was confined to his bed by a very grave illness,—the only one he had ever known . His physician said it was nervous fever , and occasioned by moral shock or excitement ; it was attended with delirium . His recovery was slow , and when it was sufficiently completed he quitted England ; and we find him now , with his mind composed , his strength restored , and his spirits braced , in that gay city of Paris ; hiding , perhaps , some earnest purpose amid his participation in its holiday enjoyments . He is now , as I have said , seated before his writing - table in deep thought . He takes up a letter which he had already glanced over hastily , and reperuses it with more care . The letter is from his cousin , the Duke of Alton , who had succeeded a few years since to the family honours,—an able man , with no small degree of information , an ardent politician , but of very rational and temperate opinions ; too much occupied by the cares of a princely estate to covet office for himself ; too sincere a patriot not to desire office for those to whose hands he thought the country might be most safely entrusted ; an intimate friend of Graham ’s . The contents of the letter are these : — As he put down this letter , Graham heaved a short impatient sigh . “
31094	31096	30713	30713	he	1734	” he muttered,—“a
31122	31150	30713	30713	he	1734	” At this moment the door - bell of the apartment rang , and a servant whom Graham had hired at Paris as a laquais de place announced “
31154	31166	30713	30713	he	1734	” Graham hurried the letter into his portfolio , and said , “
31179	31180	31184	31184	Monsieur	1741	” “
31186	31187	31184	31184	Monsieur	1741	” “
31194	31235	31189	31189	him	1739	” There entered a wonderfully thin man , middle - aged , clothed in black , his face cleanly shaven , his hair cut very short , with one of those faces which , to use a French expression , say “
31238	31346	31347	31347	He	1739	” It was absolutely without expression : it had not even , despite its thinness , one salient feature . If you had found yourself anywhere seated next to that man , your eye would have passed him over as too insignificant to notice ; if at a cafe , you would have gone on talking to your friend without lowering your voice . What mattered it whether a bete like that overheard or not ? Had you been asked to guess his calling and station , you might have said , minutely observing the freshness of his clothes and the undeniable respectability of his tout ensemble , “
31373	31403	31347	31347	He	1739	” Graham rose at the entrance of his visitor , motioned him courteously to a seat beside him , and waiting till the laquais had vanished , then asked , “
31407	31408	31347	31347	He	1739	” “
31464	31465	31462	31462	Louise	385	” “
31470	31471	31468	31468	Louise	385	” “
31504	31523	31526	31527	Louise Duval	385	” Here M. Renard took out a note - book , turned over the leaves , and resumed , “
31722	31723	31720	31720	Monsieur	1764	” “
31727	31728	31720	31720	Monsieur	1764	” “
31896	31897	31898	31898	You	1758	” “
31918	31919	31930	31930	Monsieur	1775	” “
32143	32144	32138	32138	Monsieur	1787	” “
32202	32203	32209	32209	Monsieur	1788	” “
32324	32325	32333	32333	she	1505	” “
32349	32350	32361	32361	Monsieur	1794	” “
32375	32376	32377	32377	I	0	” “
32478	32479	32480	32480	You	1784	” “
32546	32603	32739	32741	Monsieur le Marquis	369	” M. Renard , having thus poetically delivered himself of that philosophical dogma , rose to depart . Graham slipped into his hand a bank - note of sufficient value to justify the profound bow he received in return . When M. Renard had gone , Graham heaved another impatient sigh , and said to himself , “
32614	32738	32739	32741	Monsieur le Marquis	369	” Then , compressing his lips as a man who forces himself to something he dislikes , he dipped his pen into the inkstand , and wrote rapidly thus to his kinsman : AT about the same hour on the same day in which the Englishman held the conference with the Parisian detective just related , the Marquis de Rochebriant found himself by appointment in the cabinet d’affaires of his avoue M. Gandrin that gentleman had hitherto not found time to give him a definite opinion as to the case submitted to his judgment . The avoue received Alain with a kind of forced civility , in which the natural intelligence of the Marquis , despite his inexperience of life , discovered embarrassment . “
32743	32755	32739	32741	Monsieur le Marquis	369	” said Gandrin , fidgeting among the papers on his bureau , “
32800	32801	32802	32802	Sir	8224	” “
32804	32811	32802	32802	Sir	8224	” said the Marquis , haughtily , “
32823	32824	32825	32825	I	0	” “
32974	32975	32976	32976	Monsieur	1758	” “
32978	33002	32976	32976	Monsieur	1758	” said the Marquis , with that inborn imperturbable loftiness of sang froid which has always in adverse circumstances characterized the French noblesse , “
33043	33044	33046	33046	you	1758	” “
33155	33174	33144	33144	you	1758	” M. Gandrin spoke with a certain dignity of voice and manner which touched and softened his listener . “
33188	33192	33175	33175	You	1758	” replied Alain . “
33215	33216	33221	33221	my	0	” “
33350	33351	33345	33346	M. Hebert	401	” “
33406	33407	33404	33404	Frenchman	473	” “
33452	33453	33445	33445	you	1828	” “
33533	33534	33486	33490	the severest and most menacing	1829	” “
33543	33544	33486	33490	the severest and most menacing	1829	” “
33576	33577	33554	33560	the other mortgagees , who are Bretons	1832	” “
33641	33703	33704	33704	I	0	” The Marquis hesitated , but the thought of the sharp and seemingly hopeless struggle for the retention of his ancestral home to which he would be doomed if he returned from Paris unsuccessful in his errand overmastered his pride . He felt as if that self - conquest was a duty he owed to the very tombs of his fathers . “
33716	33724	33726	33726	I	0	” said he , smiling somewhat sadly , “
33735	33736	33737	33737	You	1828	” “
33762	33807	33753	33753	him	399	” The Marquis had no sooner quitted the house than M. Gandrin opened a door at the side of his office , and a large portly man strode into the room,—stride it was rather than step,—firm , self - assured , arrogant , masterful . “
33813	33839	33810	33811	mon ami	1837	” said this man , taking his stand at the hearth , as a king might take his stand in the hall of his vassal , “
33847	33848	33843	33845	our petit muscadin	1839	” “
33859	33865	33867	33867	he	1839	” replied Gandrin , peevishly ; “
33906	33907	33893	33893	you	474	” “
33926	33939	33911	33911	I	0	” said M. Louvier , with a sort of careless rollicking pomposity . “
33956	33957	33953	33953	Your	1847	” “
33960	33961	33953	33953	Your	1847	” “
33996	34050	33987	33987	your	474	” Louvier took up the papers , seated himself in an armchair by the fireplace , stretched out his legs , and read at his ease , but with a very rapid eye , as a practised lawyer skims through the technical forms of a case to fasten upon the marrow of it . “
34107	34108	34105	34105	Gandrin	402	” “
34119	34120	34414	34414	Alain	351	” “
34139	34175	34129	34129	I	0	” As he spoke he laughed , not sardonically,—a jovial laugh,—and opened wide , to reshut as in a vice , the strong iron hand which had doubtless closed over many a man ’s all . “
34184	34411	34414	34414	Alain	351	” He tossed the papers back on the bureau , nodded a royal nod , and strode forth imperiously as he had strode in . MEANWHILE the young Marquis pursued his way thoughtfully through the streets , and entered the Champs Elysees . Since we first , nay , since we last saw him , he is strikingly improved in outward appearances . He has unconsciously acquired more of the easy grace of the Parisian in gait and bearing . You would no longer detect the Provincial — perhaps , however , because he is now dressed , though very simply , in habiliments that belong to the style of the day . Rarely among the loungers in the Champs Elysees could be seen a finer form , a comelier face , an air of more unmistakable distinction . The eyes of many a passing fair one gazed on him , admiringly or coquettishly . But he was still so little the true Parisian that they got no smile , no look in return . He was wrapped in his own thoughts ; was he thinking of M. Louvier ? He had nearly gained the entrance of the Bois de Boulogne , when he was accosted by a voice behind , and turning round saw his friend Lemercier arm - in - arm with Graham Vane . “
34416	34428	34414	34414	Alain	351	” said Lemercier , hooking his disengaged arm into Rochebriant ’s . “
34438	34452	34429	34429	I	0	” Alain felt himself change countenance at this conjecture , and replied coldly , “
34474	34487	34457	34457	I	0	” addressing himself to the Englishman , he said with formal politeness , “
34522	34523	34513	34513	you	1855	” “
34528	34533	34513	34513	you	1855	” replied the Englishman , “
34619	34659	34608	34608	I	0	” Frederic ( the name is so familiarly English that the reader might think me pedantic did I accentuate it as French ) looked from one to the other of his two friends , half amused and half angry . “
34698	34706	34708	34709	the Marquis	8274	“ I do not comprehend your meaning , ”
34720	34723	34725	34725	Frederic	363	“ Bah ! ”
34727	34783	34725	34725	Frederic	363	“ come , franc jeu ; cards on the table . M. Gram Varn was going into the Bois at my suggestion on the chance of having another look at the pearl - coloured angel ; and you , Rochebriant , ca n’t deny that you were going into the Bois for the same object . ”
34784	34792	34794	34795	the Englishman	8366	“ One may pardon an enfant terrible , ”
34799	34852	34794	34795	the Englishman	8366	“ but an ami terrible should be sent to the galleys . Come , Marquis , let us walk back and submit to our fate . Even were the lady once more visible , we have no chance of being observed by the side of a Lovelace so accomplished and so audacious ! ”
34853	34868	34869	34870	The Parisian	1109	“ Adieu , then , recreants : I go alone . Victory or death . ”
34905	34920	34895	34895	Rochebriant	363	“ Do you think that Lemercier could be impertinent enough to accost that lady ? ”
34921	34927	34929	34930	the Englishman	8366	“ In the first place , ”
34932	35050	35051	35051	Alain	351	“ Lemercier himself tells me that the lady has for several weeks relinquished her walks in the Bois , and the probability is , therefore , that he will not have the opportunity to accost her . In the next place , it appears that when she did take her solitary walk , she did not stray far from her carriage , and was in reach of the protection of her laquais and coachman . But to speak honestly , do you , who know Lemercier better than I , take him to be a man who would commit an impertinence to a woman unless there were viveurs of his own sex to see him do it ? ”
35054	35178	35051	35051	Alain	351	“ No . Frederic ’s real nature is an admirable one , and if he ever do anything that he ought to be ashamed of , ‘ twill be from the pride of showing how finely he can do it . Such was his character at college , and such it still seems at Paris . But it is true that the lady has forsaken her former walk ; at least I — I have not seen her since the day I first beheld her in company with Frederic . Yet — yet , pardon me , you were going to the Bois on the chance of seeing her . Perhaps she has changed the direction of her walk , and — and — ”
35213	35537	35188	35189	The Englishman	477	“ If the lady has selected some other spot for her promenade , I am ignorant of it ; nor have I ever volunteered the chance of meeting with her , since I learned — first from Lemercier , and afterwards from others — that her destination is the stage . Let us talk frankly , Marquis . I am accustomed to take much exercise on foot , and the Bois is my favourite resort : one day I there found myself in the allee which the lady we speak of used to select for her promenade , and there saw her . Something in her face impressed me ; how shall I describe the impression ? Did you ever open a poem , a romance , in some style wholly new to you , and before you were quite certain whether or not its merits justified the interest which the novelty inspired , you were summoned away , or the book was taken out of your hands ? If so , did you not feel an intellectual longing to have another glimpse of the book ? That illustration describes my impression , and I own that I twice again went to the same allee . The last time I only caught sight of the young lady as she was getting into her carriage . As she was then borne away , I perceived one of the custodians of the Bois ; and learned , on questioning him , that the lady was in the habit of walking always alone in the same allee at the same hour on most fine days , but that he did not know her name or address . A motive of curiosity — perhaps an idle one — then made me ask Lemercier , who boasts of knowing his Paris so intimately , if he could inform me who the lady was . He undertook to ascertain . ”
35538	35541	35543	35544	the Marquis	8274	“ But , ”
35546	35583	35543	35544	the Marquis	8274	“ he did not ascertain who she was ; he only ascertained where she lived , and that she and an elder companion were Italians;—whom he suspected , without sufficient ground , to be professional singers . ”
35584	35689	35690	35692	The young lady	9237	“ True ; but since then I ascertained more detailed particulars from two acquaintances of mine who happen to know her,—M. Savarin , the distinguished writer , and Mrs. Morley , an accomplished and beautiful American lady , who is more than an acquaintance . I may boast the honour of ranking among her friends . As Savarin ’s villa is at A — — — , I asked him incidentally if he knew the fair neighbour whose face had so attracted me ; and Mrs. Morley being present , and overhearing me , I learned from both what I now repeat to you . “
36011	36012	36013	36013	You	1907	” “
36029	36030	36013	36013	You	1907	” “
36093	36094	36087	36087	singers	1911	” “
36097	36110	36087	36087	singers	1911	” said Alain , in a tone of voice that implied doubt , “
36140	36141	36142	36142	Lemercier	363	” “
36383	36430	36431	36431	Lemercier	363	” Alain involuntarily bowed his head in assent to the proposition , and , it may be , in submission to an implied rebuke . The two men walked in silence for some minutes , and Graham first spoke , changing altogether the subject of conversation . “
36458	36459	36431	36431	Lemercier	363	” “
36478	36479	36466	36466	your	1925	” “
36550	36551	36552	36552	Mine	1925	” “

36976	36977	36972	36974	a hopeless minority	1959	” “
37232	37233	37234	37234	Beautifully	483	” “
37237	37242	37234	37234	Beautifully	483	” exclaimed the Marquis . “
37350	37391	37392	37392	Your	1990	” Alain de Rochebriant was a brave man , with that intense sentiment of patriotism which characterizes Frenchmen of every rank and persuasion , unless they belong to the Internationalists ; and , without pausing to consider , he cried , “
37397	37402	37392	37392	Your	1990	” The Englishman resumed : “
37502	37503	37504	37504	You	351	” “
37511	37522	37504	37504	You	351	” said the Marquis , half mournfully , half haughtily , “
37534	37535	37524	37524	you	351	” “
37681	37705	37706	37711	One of our most eminent personages	2010	” The Marquis had felt deeply interested in this narrative , and as Graham now paused , took his hand and pressed it . “
37769	37770	37765	37765	I	0	” “
37778	37782	37771	37771	I	0	” said Rochebriant ; “
37820	37974	37975	37975	I	0	” Just as he said this , and towards the Paris end of the Champs Elysees , there was a halt , a sensation among the loungers round them ; many of them uncovered in salute . A man on the younger side of middle age , somewhat inclined to corpulence , with a very striking countenance , was riding slowly by . He returned the salutations he received with the careless dignity of a Personage accustomed to respect , and then reined in his horse by the side of a barouche , and exchanged some words with a portly gentleman who was its sole occupant . The loungers , still halting , seemed to contemplate this parley — between him on horseback and him in the carriage — with very eager interest . Some put their hands behind their ears and pressed forward , as if trying to overhear what was said . “
37978	37982	37975	37975	I	0	” quoth Graham , “
38006	38007	38008	38009	The Prince	486	” “
38011	38020	38022	38022	Prince	486	” said Rochebriant , rousing himself from revery ; “
38024	38025	38022	38022	Prince	486	” “
38049	38050	38043	38043	Louvier	399	” “
38063	38064	38061	38061	Louvier	399	” “
38089	38090	38080	38083	a very lenient one	2022	” “
38096	38100	38091	38091	Hein!—I	2023	” said Alain . “
38119	38120	38113	38113	you	0	” “
38224	38233	38217	38217	Lemercier	363	” Lemercier ’s coupe stopped beside the footpath . “
38241	38246	38249	38249	she	2036	” asked the Englishman . “
38340	38370	38371	38371	Piccola	487	” Alain felt a sensation of relief that Lemercier had not seen the lady in the pearl - coloured dress , and quitted the Englishman with a lightened heart . “
38388	38514	38382	38383	M. Louvier	399	” This was said in Italian by an elderly lady bursting noisily into the room,—elderly , yet with a youthful expression of face , owing perhaps to a pair of very vivacious black eyes . She was dressed , after a somewhat slatternly fashion , in a wrapper of crimson merino much the worse for wear , a blue handkerchief twisted turban - like round her head , and her feet encased in list slippers . The person to whom she addressed herself was a young lady with dark hair , which , despite its evident repugnance , was restrained into smooth glossy braids over the forehead , and at the crown of the small graceful head into the simple knot which Horace has described as “
38517	38652	38654	38656	a handsome woman	2046	” Her dress contrasted the speaker ’s by an exquisite neatness . We have seen her before as the lady in the pearl - coloured robe ; but seen now at home she looks much younger . She was one of those whom , encountered in the streets or in society , one might guess to be married,—probably a young bride ; for thus seen there was about her an air of dignity and of self - possession which suits well with the ideal of chaste youthful matronage ; and in the expression of the face there was a pensive thoughtfulness beyond her years . But as she now sat by the open window arranging flowers in a glass bowl , a book lying open on her lap , you would never have said , “
38658	38664	38666	38668	a charming girl	2047	” you would have said , “
38670	39935	39936	39937	Monsieur Louvier	474	” All about her was maidenly , innocent , and fresh . The dignity of her bearing was lost in household ease , the pensiveness of her expression in an untroubled serene sweetness . Perhaps many of my readers may have known friends engaged in some absorbing cause of thought , and who are in the habit when they go out , especially if on solitary walks , to take that cause of thought with them . The friend may be an orator meditating his speech , a poet his verses , a lawyer a difficult case , a physician an intricate malady . If you have such a friend , and you observe him thus away from his home , his face will seem to you older and graver . He is absorbed in the care that weighs on him . When you see him in a holiday moment at his own fireside , the care is thrown aside ; perhaps he mastered while abroad the difficulty that had troubled him ; he is cheerful , pleasant , sunny . This appears to be very much the case with persons of genius . When in their own houses we usually find them very playful and childlike . Most persons of real genius , whatever they may seem out of doors , are very sweet - tempered at home , and sweet temper is sympathizing and genial in the intercourse of private life . Certainly , observing this girl as she now bends over the flowers , it would be difficult to believe her to be the Isaura Cicogna whose letters to Madame de Grantinesnil exhibit the doubts and struggles of an unquiet , discontented , aspiring mind . Only in one or two passages in those letters would you have guessed at the writer in the girl as we now see her . It is in those passages where she expresses her love of harmony , and her repugnance to contest : those were characteristics you might have read in her face . Certainly the girl is very lovely : what long dark eyelashes ! what soft , tender , dark - blue eyes ! now that she looks up and smiles , what a bewitching smile it is ! by what sudden play of rippling dimples the smile is enlivened and redoubled ! Do you notice one feature ? In very showy beauties it is seldom noticed ; but I , being in my way a physiognomist , consider that it is always worth heeding as an index of character . It is the ear . Remark how delicately it is formed in her : none of that heaviness of lobe which is a sure sign of sluggish intellect and coarse perception . Hers is the artist ’s ear . Note next those hands : how beautifully shaped ! small , but not doll - like hands,—ready and nimble , firm and nervous hands , that could work for a helpmate . By no means very white , still less red , but somewhat embrowned as by the sun , such as you may see in girls reared in southern climes , and in her perhaps betokening an impulsive character which had not accustomed itself , when at sport in the open air , to the thraldom of gloves,—very impulsive people even in cold climates seldom do . In conveying to us by a few bold strokes an idea of the sensitive , quick - moved , warm - blooded Henry II . , the most impulsive of the Plantagenets , his contemporary chronicler tells us that rather than imprison those active hands of his , even in hawking - gloves , he would suffer his falcon to fix its sharp claws into his wrist . No doubt there is a difference as to what is befitting between a burly bellicose creature like Henry II . and a delicate young lady like Isaura Cicogna ; and one would not wish to see those dainty wrists of hers seamed and scarred by a falcon ’s claws . But a girl may not be less exquisitely feminine for slight heed of artificial prettiness . Isaura had no need of pale bloodless hands to seem one of Nature ’s highest grade of gentlewomen even to the most fastidious eyes . About her there was a charm apart from her mere beauty , and often disturbed instead of heightened by her mere intellect : it consisted in a combination of exquisite artistic refinement , and of a generosity of character by which refinement was animated into vigour and warmth . The room , which was devoted exclusively to Isaura , had in it much that spoke of the occupant . That room , when first taken furnished , had a good deal of the comfortless showiness which belongs to ordinary furnished apartments in France , especially in the Parisian suburbs , chiefly let for the summer : thin limp muslin curtains that decline to draw ; stiff mahogany chairs covered with yellow Utrecht velvet ; a tall secretaire in a dark corner ; an oval buhl - table set in tawdry ormolu , islanded in the centre of a poor but gaudy Scotch carpet ; and but one other table of dull walnut - wood , standing clothless before a sofa to match the chairs ; the eternal ormolu clock flanked by the two eternal ormolu candelabra on the dreary mantelpiece . Some of this garniture had been removed , others softened into cheeriness and comfort . The room somehow or other — thanks partly to a very moderate expenditure in pretty twills with pretty borders , gracefully simple table - covers , with one or two additional small tables and easy - chairs , two simple vases filled with flowers ; thanks still more to a nameless skill in re - arrangement , and the disposal of the slight knick - knacks and well - bound volumes , which , even in travelling , women who have cultivated the pleasures of taste carry about them — had been coaxed into that quiet harmony , that tone of consistent subdued colour , which corresponded with the characteristics of the inmate . Most people might have been puzzled where to place the piano , a semi - grand , so as not to take up too much space in the little room ; but where it was placed it seemed so at home that you might have supposed the room had been built for it . There are two kinds of neatness,—one is too evident , and makes everything about it seem trite and cold and stiff ; and another kind of neatness disappears from our sight in a satisfied sense of completeness,—like some exquisite , simple , finished style of writing , an Addison ’s or a St. Pierre ’s . This last sort of neatness belonged to Isaura , and brought to mind the well - known line of Catullus when on recrossing his threshold he invokes its welcome,—a line thus not inelegantly translated by Leigh Hunt , I entreat the reader ’s pardon for this long descriptive digression ; but Isaura is one of those characters which are called many - sided , and therefore not very easy to comprehend . She gives us one side of her character in her correspondence with Madame de Grantmesnil , and another side of it in her own home with her Italian companion,—half nurse , half chaperon . “
39943	39960	39936	39937	Monsieur Louvier	474	” said Isaura , looking up from the flowers with the dimpled smile we have noticed . “
39989	39990	39984	39984	your	492	” “
39999	40008	39991	39991	You	492	” exclaimed the Signora , in evident consternation . “
40039	40108	40033	40035	le bon Dieu	494	“ And such beautiful ices one gets at M. Louvier ’s ! Did you taste the pistachio ice ? What fine rooms , and so well lit up ! I adore light . And the ladies so beautifully dressed : one sees the fashions . Stay at home ! play at Euchre indeed ! Piccola , you can not be so cruel to yourself : you are young . ”
40109	40229	40033	40035	le bon Dieu	494	“ But , dear Madre , just consider ; we are invited because we are considered professional singers : your reputation as such is of course established,—mine is not ; but still I shall be asked to sing , as I was asked before ; and you know Dr. C. forbids me to do so except to a very small audience ; and it is so ungracious always to say ‘ No ; ’ and besides , did you not yourself say , when we came away last time from M. Louvier ’s , that it was very dull , that you knew nobody , and that the ladies had such superb toilets that you felt mortified — and — ”
40230	40282	40033	40035	le bon Dieu	494	“ Zitto ! zitto ! you talk idly , Piccola,—very idly . I was mortified then in my old black Lyons silk ; but have I not bought since then my beautiful Greek jacket,—scarlet and gold lace ? and why should I buy it if I am not to show it ? ”
40283	40328	40033	40035	le bon Dieu	494	“ But , dear Madre , the jacket is certainly very handsome , and will make an effect in a little dinner at the Savarins or Mrs. Morley ’s ; but in a great formal reception like M. Louvier ’s will it not look — ”
40329	40332	40334	40335	the Signora	430	“ Splendid ! ”
40337	40341	40334	40335	the Signora	430	“ But singolare . ”
40342	40373	40374	40374	Isaura	454	“ So much the better ; did not that great English Lady wear such a jacket , and did not every one admire her , piu tosto invidia the compassione ? ”
40771	40775	40752	40752	she	454	“ Cosa stupenda ! ”
40868	40879	40880	40880	Isaura	454	“ You are not young and handsome enough for that ? ”
40885	40899	40880	40880	Isaura	454	“ For many reasons I would rather stay at home , dear Madre . ”
40900	40911	40913	40914	the Signora	9337	“ Ah ! I see you are ashamed of me , ”
40920	40939	40913	40914	the Signora	9337	“ very natural . When the nightingale sings no more , she is only an ugly brown bird ; ”
40984	40991	40961	40961	her	454	“ Of course we will go ; ”
40994	41016	40961	40961	her	454	“ but let me choose you another dress,—a dark - green velvet trimmed with blonde : blonde becomes you so well . ”
41017	41070	40961	40961	her	454	“ No , no : I hate green velvet ; anybody can wear that . Piccola , I am not clever like thee ; I can not amuse myself like thee with books . I am in a foreign land . I have a poor head , but I have a big heart ”
41078	41091	40961	40961	her	454	“ and that big heart is set on my beautiful Greek jacket . ”
41092	41096	41098	41098	Isaura	454	“ Dearest Madre , ”
41104	41150	41098	41098	Isaura	454	“ forgive me , you are right . The Greek jacket is splendid ; I shall be so pleased to see you wear it : poor Madre ! so pleased to think that in the foreign land you are not without something that pleases you ! ”
41203	41209	41211	41212	M. Gandrin	402	“ I think , Marquis , ”
41214	41251	41211	41212	M. Gandrin	402	“ that you will not regret having followed my advice : my representations have disposed Louvier to regard you with much favour , and he is certainly flattered by being permitted to make your personal acquaintance . ”
41422	41524	41526	41526	he	2085	“ Charmed to make your acquaintance , Marquis ; still more charmed if you will let me be useful during your sejour at Paris . Ma foi , excuse my bluntness , but you are a fort beau garcon . Monsieur your father was a handsome man , but you beat him hollow . Gandrin , my friend , would not you and I give half our fortunes for one year of this fine fellow ’s youth spent at Paris ? Peste ! what love - letters we should have , with no need to buy them by billets de banque ! ”
41671	41679	41680	41680	he	399	“ The best thing in the world , ”
41683	41857	41680	41680	he	399	“ and one gets it so seldom since the old Rocher de Cancale has lost its renown . At private houses , what does one get now ? blanc de poulet , flavourless trash . After all , Gandrin , when we lose the love - letters , it is some consolation that laitances de carpes and sautes de foie gras are still left to fill up the void in our hearts . Marquis , heed my counsel ; cultivate betimes the taste for the table,—that and whist are the sole resources of declining years . You never met my old friend Talleyrand — ah , no ! he was long before your time . He cultivated both , but he made two mistakes . No man ’s intellect is perfect on all sides . He confined himself to one meal a day , and he never learned to play well at whist . Avoid his errors , my young friend,—avoid them . Gandrin , I guess this pineapple is English,—it is superb . ”
41858	41869	41944	41944	Gandrin	402	“ You are right,—a present from the Marquis of H———- . ”
41870	41908	41909	41911	The affable financier	2090	“ Ah ! instead of a fee , I wager . The Marquis gives nothing for nothing , dear man ! Droll people the English . You have never visited England , I presume , cher Rochebriant ? ”
41984	42159	41966	41966	Louvier	399	“ My dear Rochebriant , your father and I did not quite understand each other . He took a tone of grand seigneur that sometimes wounded me ; and I in turn was perhaps too rude in asserting my rights — as creditor , shall I say?—no , as fellow - citizen ; and Frenchmen are so vain , so over - susceptible ; fire up at a word ; take offence when none is meant . We two , my dear boy , should be superior to such national foibles . Bref — I have a mortgage on your lands . Why should that thought mar our friendship ? At my age , though I am not yet old , one is flattered if the young like us , pleased if we can oblige them , and remove from their career any little obstacle in its way . Gandrin tells me you wish to consolidate all the charges on your estate into one on a lower rate of interest . Is it so ? ”
42160	42166	42168	42169	the Marquis	8274	“ I am so advised , ”
42171	42237	42168	42169	the Marquis	8274	“ And very rightly advised ; come and talk with me about it some day next week . I hope to have a large sum of money set free in a few days . Of course , mortgages on land do n’t pay like speculations at the Bourse ; but I am rich enough to please myself . We will see , we will see . ”
42309	42312	42314	42314	Louvier	399	“ Meanwhile , ”
42320	42353	42314	42314	Louvier	399	“ I have something to say to you on business about the contract for that new street of mine . No hurry,—after our young friend has gone to his ‘ assignation . ’ ”
42419	42446	42403	42403	Louvier	399	“ Gandrin , what did you mean by saying that that young man was no muscadin ! Muscadin , aristocrate , offensive from top to toe . ”
42447	42461	42403	42403	Louvier	399	“ You amaze me ; you seemed to take to him so cordially . ”
42462	42521	42403	42403	Louvier	399	“ And pray , were you too blind to remark with what cold reserve he responded to my condescensions ; how he winced when I called him Rochebriant ; how he coloured when I called him ‘ dear boy ’ ? These aristocrats think we ought to thank them on our knees when they take our money , and ”
42526	42530	42403	42403	Louvier	399	darkened—“seduce our women . ”
42531	42548	42549	42549	I	0	“ Monsieur Louvier , in all France I do not know a greater aristocrat than yourself . ”
42576	42639	42573	42573	his	399	“ Ay , ay , millionnaires are the real aristocrats , for they have power , as my beau Marquis will soon find . I must bid you good night . Of course I shall see Madame Gandrin and yourself to - morrow . Prepare for a motley gathering,—lots of democrats and foreigners , with artists and authors , and such creatures . ”
42640	42653	42549	42549	I	0	“ Is that the reason why you did not invite the Marquis ? ”
42654	42732	42573	42573	his	399	“ To be sure ; I would not shock so pure a Legitimist by contact with the sons of the people , and make him still colder to myself . No ; when he comes to my house he shall meet lions and viveurs of the haut ton , who will play into my hands by teaching him how to ruin himself in the quickest manner and in the genre Regence . Bon soir , mon vieux . ”
43519	43527	43516	43516	he	399	“ simply , according to English notions of comfort;”—Englishmen
43532	43540	43516	43516	he	399	“ according to French notions of luxury . ”
43656	43661	43692	43693	M. Louvier	399	“ show - rooms , ”
43825	43837	43839	43846	a Frenchman with a handsome , intelligent countenance	2169	“ And how does this poor Paris metamorphosed please Monsieur Vane ? ”
44002	44011	44013	44013	Graham	378	“ Is it possible , my dear Vicomte , ”
44015	44027	44013	44013	Graham	378	“ not to be pleased with a capital so marvellously embellished ? ”
44028	44037	44039	44040	the Vicomte	2176	“ Embellished it may be to foreign eyes , ”
44044	44241	44039	44040	the Vicomte	2176	“ but not improved to the taste of a Parisian like me . I miss the dear Paris of old,—the streets associated with my beaux jours are no more . Is there not something drearily monotonous in those interminable perspectives ? How frightfully the way lengthens before one ’s eyes ! In the twists and curves of the old Paris one was relieved from the pain of seeing how far one had to go from one spot to another,—each tortuous street had a separate idiosyncrasy ; what picturesque diversities , what interesting recollections,—all swept away ! Mon Dieu ! and what for,—miles of florid facades staring and glaring at one with goggle - eyed pitiless windows ; house - rents trebled , and the consciousness that if you venture to grumble underground railways , like concealed volcanoes , can burst forth on you at any moment with an eruption of bayonets and muskets . This maudit empire seeks to keep its hold on France much as a grand seigneur seeks to enchain a nymph of the ballet,—tricks her out in finery and baubles , and insures her infidelity the moment he fails to satisfy her whims . ”
44242	44245	44247	44247	Graham	378	“ Vicomte , ”
44249	44335	44247	44247	Graham	378	“ I have had the honour to know you since I was a small boy at a preparatory school home for the holidays , and you were a guest at my father ’s country - house . You were then fete as one of the most promising writers among the young men of the day , especially favoured by the princes of the reigning family . I shall never forget the impression made on me by your brilliant appearance and your no less brilliant talk . ”
44336	44353	44355	44356	the Vicomte	506	“ Ah ! ces beaux jours ! ce bon Louis Philippe , ce cher petit Joinville , ”
44358	44502	44355	44356	the Vicomte	506	“ But at that day you compared le bon Louis Philippe to Robert Macaire . You described all his sons , including , no doubt , ce cher petit Joinville , in terms of resentful contempt , as so many plausible gamins whom Robert Macaire was training to cheat the public in the interest of the family firm . I remember my father saying to you in answer , ‘ No royal house in Europe has more sought to develop the literature of an epoch and to signalize its representatives by social respect and official honours than that of the Orleans dynasty . You , Monsieur de Breze , do but imitate your elders in seeking to destroy the dynasty under which you flourish ; should you succeed , you hommes de plume will be the first sufferers and the loudest complainers . ’ ”
44503	44508	44510	44511	the Vicomte	506	“ Cher Monsieur Vane , ”
44516	44562	44510	44511	the Vicomte	506	“ your father did me great honour in classing me with Victor Hugo , Alexandre Dumas , Emile de Girardin , and the other stars of the Orleanist galaxy , including our friend here , M. Savarin . A very superior man was your father . ”
44563	44566	44568	44568	Savarin	431	“ And , ”
44585	44643	44355	44356	the Vicomte	506	smile,—“and if I remember right , my dear De Breze , no one was more brilliantly severe than yourself on poor De Lamartine and the Republic that succeeded Louis Philippe ; no one more emphatically expressed the yearning desire for another Napoleon to restore order at home and renown abroad . Now you have got another Napoleon . ”
44644	44653	44655	44656	De Breze	514	“ And I want change for my Napoleon , ”
44660	44665	44667	44667	Graham	378	“ My dear Vicomte , ”
44669	44704	44667	44667	Graham	378	“ one thing we may all grant,—that in culture and intellect you are far superior to the mass of your fellow Parisians ; that you are therefore a favourable type of their political character . ”
44705	44716	44355	44356	the Vicomte	506	“ Ah , mon cher , vous etes trop aimable . ”
44717	44812	44355	44356	the Vicomte	506	“ And therefore I venture to say this,—if the archangel Gabriel were permitted to descend to Paris and form the best government for France that the wisdom of seraph could devise , it would not be two years — I doubt if it would be six months — before out of this Paris , which you call the Foyer des Idees , would emerge a powerful party , adorned by yourself and other hommes de plume , in favour of a revolution for the benefit of ce bon Satan and ce cher petit Beelzebub . ”
44813	44826	44828	44829	the Vicomte	506	“ What a pretty vein of satire you have , mon cher ! ”
44835	44958	44828	44829	the Vicomte	506	“ there is a sting of truth in your witticism . Indeed , I must send you some articles of mine in which I have said much the same thing,—les beaux , esprits se rencontrent . The fault of us French is impatience , desire of change ; but then it is that desire which keeps the world going and retains our place at the head of it . However , at this time we are all living too fast for our money to keep up with it , and too slow for our intellect not to flag . We vie with each other on the road to ruin , for in literature all the old paths to fame are shut up . ”
45015	45205	46198	46199	the German	520	“ There is that , Monsieur de Breze , which makes one think gravely of what you say so lightly . Viewing things with the unprejudiced eyes of a foreigner , I recognize much for which France should be grateful to the Emperor . Under his sway her material resources have been marvellously augmented ; her commerce has been placed by the treaty with England on sounder foundations , and is daily exhibiting richer life ; her agriculture had made a prodigious advance wherever it has allowed room for capitalists , and escaped from the curse of petty allotments and peasant - proprietors , a curse which would have ruined any country less blessed by Nature ; turbulent factions have been quelled ; internal order maintained ; the external prestige of France , up at least to the date of the Mexican war , increased to an extent that might satisfy even a Frenchman ’s amour propre ; and her advance in civilization has been manifested by the rapid creation of a naval power which should put even England on her mettle . But , on the other hand — ”
45206	45214	45216	45217	the Vicomte	506	“ Ay , on the other hand , ”
45219	46092	45216	45217	the Vicomte	506	“ On the other hand there are in the imperial system two causes of decay and of rot silently at work . They may not be the faults of the Emperor , but they are such misfortunes as may cause the fall of the Empire . The first is an absolute divorce between the political system and the intellectual culture of the nation . The throne and the system rest on universal suffrage,—on a suffrage which gives to classes the most ignorant a power that preponderates over all the healthful elements of knowledge . It is the tendency of all ignorant multitudes to personify themselves , as it were , in one individual . They can not comprehend you when you argue for a principle ; they do comprehend you when you talk of a name . The Emperor Napoleon is to them a name , and the prefects and officials who influence their votes are paid for incorporating all principles in the shibboleth of that single name . You have thus sought the well - spring of a political system in the deepest stratum of popular ignorance . To rid popular ignorance of its normal revolutionary bias , the rural peasants are indoctrinated with the conservatism that comes from the fear which appertains to property . They have their roots of land or their shares in a national loan . Thus you estrange the crassitude of an ignorant democracy still more from the intelligence of the educated classes by combining it with the most selfish and abject of all the apprehensions that are ascribed to aristocracy and wealth . What is thus embedded in the depths of your society makes itself shown on the surface . Napoleon III . has been compared to Augustus ; and there are many startling similitudes between them in character and in fate . Each succeeds to the heritage of a great name that had contrived to unite autocracy with the popular cause ; each subdued all rival competitors , and inaugurated despotic rule in the name of freedom ; each mingled enough of sternness with ambitious will to stain with bloodshed the commencement of his power,—but it would be an absurd injustice to fix the same degree of condemnation on the coup d’etat as humanity fixes on the earlier cruelties of Augustus ; each , once firm in his seat , became mild and clement,—Augustus perhaps from policy , Napoleon III . from a native kindliness of disposition which no fair critic of character can fail to acknowledge . Enough of similitudes ; now for one salient difference . Observe how earnestly Augustus strove , and how completely he succeeded in the task , to rally round him all the leading intellects in every grade and of every party,—the followers of Antony , the friends of Brutus ; every great captain , every great statesman , every great writer , every mail who could lend a ray of mind to his own Julian constellation , and make the age of Augustus an era in the annals of human intellect and genius . But this has not been the good fortune of your Emperor . The result of his system has been the suppression of intellect in every department . He has rallied round him not one great statesman ; his praises are hymned by not one great poet . The celebrates of a former day stand aloof ; or , preferring exile to constrained allegiance , assail him with unremitting missiles from their asylum in foreign shores . His reign is sterile of new celebrites . The few that arise enlist themselves against him . Whenever he shall venture to give full freedom to the press and to the legislature , the intellect thus suppressed or thus hostile will burst forth in collected volume . His partisans have not been trained and disciplined to meet such assailants . They will be as weak as no doubt they will be violent . And the worst is , that the intellect thus rising in mass against him will be warped and distorted , like captives who , being kept in chains , exercise their limbs on escaping in vehement jumps without definite object . The directors of emancipated opinion may thus be terrible enemies to the Imperial Government , but they will be very unsafe councillors to France . Concurrently with this divorce between the Imperial system and the national intellect,—a divorce so complete that even your salons have lost their wit , and even your caricatures their point,—a corruption of manners which the Empire , I own , did not originate , but inherit , has become so common that every one owns and nobody blames it . The gorgeous ostentation of the Court has perverted the habits of the people . The intelligence abstracted from other vents betakes itself to speculating for a fortune ; and the greed of gain and the passion for show are sapping the noblest elements of the old French manhood . Public opinion stamps with no opprobrium a minister or favourite who profits by a job ; and I fear you will find that jobbing pervades all your administrative departments . ”
46093	46098	46100	46101	De Breze	514	“ All very true , ”
46124	46148	45216	45217	the Vicomte	506	“ Virtue and Honour banished from courts and salons and the cabinet of authors ascend to fairer heights in the attics of ouvriers . ”
46149	46157	46159	46161	this terrible German	2180	“ The ouvriers , ouvriers of Paris ! ”
46163	46192	46159	46161	this terrible German	2180	“ Ay , Monsieur le Comte , what can you say against our ouvriers ? A German count can not condescend to learn anything about ces petites gens . ”
46193	46196	46198	46199	the German	520	“ Monsieur , ”
46201	46374	46198	46199	the German	520	“ in the eyes of a statesman there are no petites gens , and in those of a philosopher no petites choses . We in Germany have too many difficult problems affecting our working classes to solve , not to have induced me to glean all the information I can as to the ouvriers of Paris . They have among them men of aspirations as noble as can animate the souls of philosophers and poets , perhaps not the less noble because common - sense and experience can not follow their flight ; but as a body the ouvriers of Paris have not been elevated in political morality by the benevolent aim of the Emperor to find them ample work and good wages independent of the natural laws that regulate the markets of labour . Accustomed thus to consider the State bound to maintain them , the moment the State fails in that impossible task , they will accommodate their honesty to a rush upon property under the name of social reform . “
46562	46617	46625	46626	the Vicomte	506	“ There is many a fair and stately tree which continues to throw out its leaves and rear its crest till suddenly the wind smites it , and then , and not till then , the trunk which seems so solid is found to be but the rind to a mass of crumbled powder . ”
46618	46623	46625	46626	the Vicomte	506	“ Monsieur le Comte , ”
46628	46666	46625	46626	the Vicomte	506	“ you are a severe critic and a lugubrious prophet ; but a German is so safe from revolution that he takes alarm at the stir of movement which is the normal state of the French esprit . ”
46667	46704	46625	46626	the Vicomte	506	“ French esprit may soon evaporate into Parisian betise . As to Germany being safe from revolution , allow me to repeat a saying of Goethe’s - but has Monsieur le Vicomte ever heard of Goethe ? ”
46705	46713	46625	46626	the Vicomte	506	“ Goethe , of course,—tres joli ecrivain . ”
46714	46800	46625	46626	the Vicomte	506	“ Goethe said to some one who was making much the same remark as yourself , ‘ We Germans are in a state of revolution now , but we do things so slowly that it will be a hundred years before we Germans shall find it out ; but when completed , it will be the greatest revolution society has yet seen , and will last like the other revolutions that , beginning , scarce noticed , in Germany , have transformed the world . ’ ”
46801	46820	46856	46857	the Vicomte	522	“ Diable , Monsieur le Comte ! Germans transformed the world ! What revolutions do you speak of ? ”
46821	46848	46625	46626	the Vicomte	506	“ The invention of gunpowder , the invention of printing , and the expansion of a monk ’s quarrel with his Pope into the Lutheran revolution . ”
47034	47037	47039	47040	the German	2191	“ Sir , ”
47055	47169	47039	47040	the German	2191	“ every German reared to political service studies England as the school for practical thought distinct from impracticable theories . Long may you allow us to do so ! Only excuse me one remark,—never let the selfish element of the practical supersede the generous element . Your father never did so in his speeches , and therefore we admired him . At the present day we do n’t so much care to study English speeches ; they may be insular,—they are not European . I honour England ; Heaven grant that you may not be making sad mistakes in the belief that you can long remain England if you cease to be European . ”
47204	47215	47217	47217	Vane	525	“ Vicomte , who and what is your German count ? ”
47219	47224	47226	47230	the lively Vicomte,—“a German count	9568	“ A solemn pedant , ”

47631	47664	47589	47589	he	525	“ Nay , Monsieur Louvier , he rather overtasks the words at my command in thankfulness to those who like yourself , so kindly regard me as something else than a singer . ”
47967	47969	47958	47958	He	2226	“ sir ”

48269	48277	48279	48280	the American	2244	“ I have not heard her sing , ”
48284	48331	48279	48280	the American	2244	“ and the words ‘ singing mind ’ are doubtless accurately English , since you employ them ; but at Boston the collocation would be deemed barbarous . You fly off the handle . The epithet , sir , is not in concord with the substantive . ”
48332	48356	48279	48280	the American	2244	“ Boston would be in the right , my dear Colonel . I stand rebuked ; mind has little to do with singing . ”
48357	48391	48279	48280	the American	2244	“ I take leave to deny that , sir . You fire into the wrong flock , and would not hazard the remark if you had conversed as I have with Signorina Cicogna . ”

48464	48467	48469	48469	she	2245	“ No , ”
48476	48517	48469	48469	she	2245	“ Of course you know the Signorina , or , as we usually call her , Mademoiselle Cicogna . No ? Allow me to present you . Mr. Graham Vane , Mademoiselle Cicogna . Mademoiselle speaks English like a native . ”
48625	48630	48631	48631	she	454	“ Poor dear Madre , ”

48857	48875	48804	48804	Isaura	454	“ No ; we met her for the first time some weeks ago at M. Savarin ’s . ”

48888	48899	48807	48807	she	454	“ What ! you have heard her on that subject ? ”
48900	48967	48804	48804	Isaura	454	“ I have rarely heard her on any other , though she is the best and perhaps the cleverest friend I have at Paris ; but that may be my fault , for I like to start it . It is a relief to the languid small - talk of society to listen to any one thoroughly in earnest upon turning the world topsy - turvy . ”
48968	48986	48988	48988	Isaura	454	“ Do you suppose poor Mrs. Morley would seek to do that if she had her rights ? ”
48995	49009	48991	48991	her	454	“ Not a doubt of it ; but perhaps you share her opinions . ”
49010	49021	48807	48807	she	454	“ I scarcely know what her opinions are , but — ”
49022	49025	48807	48807	she	454	“ Yes?—but — ”
49026	49054	48991	48991	her	454	“ There is a — what shall I call it?—a persuasion , a sentiment , out of which the opinions probably spring , that I do share . ”
49055	49090	48807	48807	she	454	“ Indeed ? a persuasion , a sentiment , for instance , that a woman should have votes in the choice of legislators , and , I presume , in the task of legislation ? ”
49091	49122	48807	48807	she	454	“ No , that is not what I mean . Still , that is an opinion , right or wrong , which grows out of the sentiment I speak of . ”
49123	49129	48991	48991	her	454	“ Pray explain the sentiment . ”
49130	49399	48807	48807	she	454	“ It is always so difficult to define a sentiment ; but does it not strike you that in proportion as the tendency of modern civilization has been to raise women more and more to an intellectual equality with men , in proportion as they read and study and think , an uneasy sentiment , perhaps querulous , perhaps unreasonable , grows up within their minds that the conventions of the world are against the complete development of the faculties thus aroused and the ambition thus animated ; that they can not but rebel , though it may be silently , against the notions of the former age , when women were not thus educated , notions that the aim of the sex should be to steal through life unremarked ; that it is a reproach to be talked of ; that women are plants to be kept in a hothouse and forbidden the frank liberty of growth in the natural air and sunshine of heaven ? This , at least , is a sentiment which has sprung up within myself ; and I imagine that it is the sentiment which has given birth to many of the opinions or doctrines that seem absurd , and very likely are so , to the general public . I do n’t pretend even to have considered those doctrines ; I do n’t pretend to say what may be the remedies for the restlessness and uneasiness I feel . I doubt if on this earth there be any remedies ; all I know is , that I feel restless and uneasy . ”
49589	49593	49595	49595	Graham	378	“ I believe , ”
49601	49913	49595	49595	Graham	378	“ that I comprehend your sentiment much better than I do Mrs. Morley ’s opinions ; but permit me one observation . You say truly that the course of modern civilization has more or less affected the relative position of woman cultivated beyond that level on which she was formerly contented to stand,—the nearer perhaps to the heart of man because not lifting her head to his height,—and hence a sense of restlessness , uneasiness ; but do you suppose that , in this whirl and dance of the atoms which compose the rolling ball of the civilized world , it is only women that are made restless and uneasy ? Do you not see amid the masses congregated in the wealthiest cities of the world , writhings and struggles against the received order of things ? In this sentiment of discontent there is a certain truthfulness , because it is an element of human nature , and how best to deal with it is a problem yet unsolved ; but in the opinions and doctrines to which , among the masses , the sentiment gives birth , the wisdom of the wisest detects only the certainty of a common ruin , offering for reconstruction the same building - materials as the former edifice,—materials not likely to be improved because they may be defaced . Ascend from the working classes to all others in which civilized culture prevails , and you will find that same restless feeling,—the fluttering of untried wings against the bars between wider space and their longings . Could you poll all the educated ambitious young men in England,—perhaps in Europe,—at least half of them , divided between a reverence for the past and a curiosity as to the future , would sigh , ‘ I am born a century too late or a century too soon ! ’ ”
49954	50070	49951	49951	he	2266	“ I see your Madre and our American friends are darting angry looks at me . They have made room for us at the table , and are wondering why I should keep you thus from the good things of this little life . One word more ere we join them,—consult your own mind , and consider whether your uneasiness and unrest are caused solely by conventional shackles on your sex . Are they not equally common to the youth of ours,—common to all who seek in art , in letters , nay , in the stormier field of active life , to clasp as a reality some image yet seen but as a dream ? ”
50154	50176	50142	50143	Mrs. Morley	462	“ Now , Mr. Vane , you have no option but to take care of me to the shawl - room . ”
50234	50241	50243	50243	Graham	378	“ I think she is charming , ”
50245	50277	50243	50243	Graham	378	“ Of course ; that is the stereotyped answer to all such questions , especially by you Englishmen . In public or in private , England is the mouthpiece of platitudes . ”
50278	50326	50216	50217	Mrs. Morley	462	“ It is natural for an American to think so . Every child that has just learned to speak uses bolder expressions than its grandmamma ; but I am rather at a loss to know by what novelty of phrase an American would have answered your question . ”
50327	50348	50216	50217	Mrs. Morley	462	“ An American would have discovered that Isaura Cicogna had a soul , and his answer would have confessed it . ”
50349	50450	50243	50243	Graham	378	“ It strikes me that he would then have uttered a platitude more stolid than mine . Every Christian knows that the dullest human being has a soul . But , to speak frankly , I grant that my answer did not do justice to the Signorina , nor to the impression she makes on me ; and putting aside the charm of the face , there is a charm in a mind that seems to have gathered stores of reflection which I should scarcely have expected to find in a young lady brought up to be a professional singer . ”
50451	50503	50216	50217	Mrs. Morley	462	“ You add prejudice to platitude , and are horribly prosaic to - night ; but here we are in the shawl - room . I must take another opportunity of attacking you . Pray dine with us tomorrow ; you will meet our Minister and a few other pleasant friends . ”
50504	50519	50521	50521	Vane	378	“ I suppose I must not say , ‘ I shall be charmed , ’ ”
50523	50529	50521	50521	Vane	378	“ but I shall be . ”
50530	50568	50569	50569	Graham	378	“ Bon Dieu ! that horrid fat man has deserted Signora Venosta,—looking for his own cloak , I dare say ; selfish monster ! Go and hand her to her carriage ; quick , it is announced ! ”
50621	50626	50627	50627	she	2279	“ I am afraid , ”
50642	50667	50627	50627	she	2279	cochere,—“I am afraid that I did not make a good effect to - night . I was nervous ; did not you perceive it ? ”
50668	50678	50680	50681	the dissimulator	2283	“ No , indeed ; you enchanted us all ; ”
50683	50756	50627	50627	she	2279	“ How amiable you are to say so ! You must think that I sought for a compliment . So I did ; you gave me more than I deserved . Wine is the milk of old men , and praise of old women ; but an old man may be killed by too much wine , and an old woman lives all the longer for too much praise . Buona notte . ”
50792	50856	50788	50789	the Frenchman	2288	“ Madame Savarin and I complain that you have not let us see so much of you as we ought . No doubt you are greatly sought after ; but are you free to take your soup with us the day after to - morrow ? You will meet the Count von Rudesheim , and a few others more lively if less wise . ”
50857	50887	50788	50789	the Frenchman	2288	“ The day after to - morrow I will mark with a white stone . To dine with M. Savarin is an event to a man who covets distinction . ”
50888	50957	50788	50789	the Frenchman	2288	“ Such compliments reconcile an author to his trade . You deserve the best return I can make you . You will meet la belle Isaura . I have just engaged her and her chaperon . She is a girl of true genius ; and genius is like those objects of virtu which belong to a former age , and become every day more scarce and more precious . ”
50979	51024	50971	50972	The American	530	“ I am glad , sir , to hear from my wife that you dine with us to - morrow . Sir , you will meet Mademoiselle Cicogna , and I am not without a kinkle [ notion ] that you will be enthused . ”
51025	51032	51036	51036	he	378	“ This seems like a fatality , ”
51046	51067	51036	51036	he	378	“ I strove to banish that haunting face from my mind . I had half forgotten it , and now — ”
51097	51100	51101	51101	he	378	“ Pooh ! ”
51115	51172	51101	51101	he	378	“ is my reason so weak that it should be influenced by a mere superstition ? Surely I know myself too well , and have tried myself too long , to fear that I should be untrue to the duty and ends of my life , even if I found my heart in danger of suffering . ”
51407	51436	51437	51437	She	2301	“ Your pardon is granted without the humiliation of asking for it ; we know that the characteristic of the English is always to be a little behindhand . ”
51496	51507	51509	51509	Vane	378	“ Have you ever visited the United States , Mademoiselle ? ”
51519	51522	51509	51509	Vane	378	“ No . ”
51523	51535	51486	51486	she	2301	“ It is a voyage you are sure to make soon . ”
51536	51540	51486	51486	she	2301	“ Why so ? ”
51541	51585	51509	51509	Vane	378	“ Because report says you will create a great sensation at the very commencement of your career ; and the New World is ever eager to welcome each celebrity that is achieved in the Old,—more especially that which belongs to your enchanting art . ”
51586	51591	51593	51595	an American senator	2307	“ True , sir , ”
51603	51632	51593	51595	an American senator	2307	“ we are an appreciative people ; and if that lady be as fine a singer as I am told , she might command any amount of dollars . ”
51654	51665	51667	51667	Graham	378	“ I ought of course to say ‘ yes , ’ ”
51674	51806	51667	51667	Graham	378	“ but I doubt if that ‘ yes ’ would be an honest one . In some moods , music — if a kind of music I like — affects me very deeply ; in other moods , not at all . And I can not bear much at a time . A concert wearies me shamefully ; even an opera always seems to me a great deal too long . But I ought to add that I am no judge of music ; that music was never admitted into my education ; and , between ourselves , I doubt if there be one Englishman in five hundred who would care for opera or concert if it were not the fashion to say he did . Does my frankness revolt you ? ”
51807	51828	51926	51928	the American Minister	2302	“ On the contrary , I sometimes doubt , especially of late , if I am fond of music myself . ”
51829	51866	51867	51867	he	2308	“ Signorina,—pardon me,—it is impossible that you should not be . Genius can never be untrue to itself , and must love that in which it excels , that by which it communicates joy , and , ”
51877	51882	51867	51867	he	2308	“ attains to glory . ”
51883	51899	51901	51901	Isaura	454	“ Genius is a divine word , and not to be applied to a singer , ”
52184	52223	52178	52178	Isaura	454	“ I understand why you did not cultivate music ; and I think , too , that I can now understand what effects the human voice can produce on human minds without recurring to the art of song . ”
52224	52227	52229	52229	Graham	378	“ Ah , ”
52236	52335	52229	52229	Graham	378	“ do not make me ashamed of my former rudeness by the revenge of compliment ; and , above all , do not disparage your own art by supposing that any prose effect of voice in its utterance of mind can interpret that which music alone can express , even to listeners so uncultured as myself . Am I not told truly by musical composers , when I ask them to explain in words what they say in their music , that such explanation is impossible , that music has a language of its own untranslatable by words ? ”
52336	52339	52341	52341	Isaura	454	“ Yes , ”
52350	52370	52341	52341	Isaura	454	“ you are told truly . It was only the other day that I was pondering over that truth . ”
52371	52617	52229	52229	Graham	378	“ But what recesses of mind , of heart , of soul , this untranslatable language penetrates and brightens up ! How incomplete the grand nature of man — though man the grandest — would be , if you struck out of his reason the comprehension of poetry , music , and religion ! In each are reached and are sounded deeps in his reason otherwise concealed from himself . History , knowledge , science , stop at the point in which mystery begins . There they meet with the world of shadow . Not an inch of that world can they penetrate without the aid of poetry and religion , two necessities of intellectual man much more nearly allied than the votaries of the practical and the positive suppose . To the aid and elevation of both those necessities comes in music , and there has never existed a religion in the world which has not demanded music as its ally . If , as I said frankly , it is only in certain moods of my mind that I enjoy music , it is only because in certain moods of my mind I am capable of quitting the guidance of prosaic reason for the world of shadow ; that I am so susceptible as at every hour , were my nature perfect , I should be to the mysterious influences of poetry and religion . Do you understand what I wish to express ? ”
52618	52627	52747	52748	The poet	8938	“ Yes , I do , and clearly . ”
52628	52671	52229	52229	Graham	378	“ Then , Signorina , you are forbidden to undervalue the gift of song . You must feel its power over the heart , when you enter the opera - house ; over the soul , when you kneel in a cathedral . ”
52672	52675	52677	52677	Isaura	454	“ Oh , ”
52691	52721	52677	52677	Isaura	454	“ how I thank you ! Is it you who say you do not love music ? How much better you understand it than I did till this moment ! ”
52790	52793	52795	52795	she	454	“ Signor , ”
52812	52858	52795	52795	she	454	“ are we so far from Paris that you can not spare the time to call ? My child does not sing in public , but at home you can hear her . It is not every woman ’s voice that is sweetest at home . ”
53557	53561	53576	53576	she	2345	“ le Paradis des Femmes,”—as
53572	53575	53576	53576	she	2345	“ But , ”
53586	53625	53576	53576	she	2345	“ the Signor does not come to hear the parrot talk ; he is engaged to come that he may hear the nightingale sing . A drop of honey attracts the fly more than a bottle of vinegar . ”
53635	53639	53641	53641	he	378	“ I submit , ”
53643	53696	53641	53641	he	378	“ to your comparison as regards myself ; but certainly anything less like a bottle of vinegar than your amiable conversation I can not well conceive . However , the metaphor apart , I scarcely know how I dare ask Mademoiselle to sing after the confession I made to her last night . ”
53697	53701	53703	53704	the Venosta	430	“ What confession ? ”
53706	53727	53703	53704	the Venosta	430	“ That I know nothing of music and doubt if I can honestly say that I am fond of it . ”
53728	53785	53792	53792	she	2351	“ Not fond of music ! Impossible ! You slander yourself . He who loves not music would have a dull time of it in heaven . But you are English , and perhaps have only heard the music of your own country . Bad , very bad — a heretic ’s music ! Now listen . ”
53798	53801	53792	53792	she	2351	“ Lucia , ”
53814	53821	53792	53792	she	2351	“ Do you really wish it ? ”
53835	53848	53792	53792	she	2351	“ I can not say how much I wish to hear you . ”
54095	54107	54109	54110	the Venosta	430	“ Do you doubt now if you are fond of music ? ”
54112	54119	54121	54121	Graham	536	“ This is more than music , ”
54150	54202	54135	54135	he	536	“ I do not think , Mademoiselle , that I could dare to hear you often ; it would take me too far from the hard real world : and he who would not be left behindhand on the road that he must journey can not indulge frequent excursions into fairyland . ”
54203	54206	54208	54208	Isaura	454	“ Yet , ”
54216	54311	54208	54208	Isaura	454	“ I was told in my childhood , by one whose genius gives authority to her words , that beside the real world lies the ideal . The real world then seemed rough to me . ‘ Escape , ’ said my counsellor , ‘ is granted from that stony thoroughfare into the fields beyond its formal hedgerows . The ideal world has its sorrows , but it never admits despair . ’ That counsel then , methought , decided my choice of life . I know not now if it has done so . ”
54312	54315	54317	54317	Graham	536	“ Fate , ”
54323	54456	54458	54458	he	536	“ Fate , which is not the ruler but the servant of Providence , decides our choice of life , and rarely from outward circumstances . Usually the motive power is within . We apply the word ‘ genius ’ to the minds of the gifted few ; but in all of us there is a genius that is inborn , a pervading something which distinguishes our very identity , and dictates to the conscience that which we are best fitted to do and to be . In so dictating it compels our choice of life ; or if we resist the dictate , we find at the close that we have gone astray . My choice of life thus compelled is on the stony thoroughfares , yours in the green fields . ”
54522	54525	54527	54527	Isaura	536	“ Why , ”
54559	54616	54527	54527	Isaura	536	sentiment,—“why must your road through the world be so exclusively the stony one ? It is not from necessity , it can not be from taste ; and whatever definition you give to genius , surely it is not your own inborn genius that dictates to you a constant exclusive adherence to the commonplace of life . ”
54617	54662	54541	54541	her	430	“ Ah , Mademoiselle , do not misrepresent me . I did not say that I could not sometimes quit the real world for fairyland,—I said that I could not do so often . My vocation is not that of a poet or artist . ”
54663	54674	54676	54676	Isaura	536	“ It is that of an orator , I know , ”
54680	54708	54676	54676	Isaura	536	“ so they tell me , and I believe them . But is not the orator somewhat akin to the poet ? Is not oratory an art ? ”
54709	54843	54541	54541	her	430	“ Let us dismiss the word orator ; as applied to English public life , it is a very deceptive expression . The Englishman who wishes to influence his countrymen by force of words spoken must mix with them in their beaten thoroughfares ; must make himself master of their practical views and interests ; must be conversant with their prosaic occupations and business ; must understand how to adjust their loftiest aspirations to their material welfare ; must avoid as the fault most dangerous to himself and to others that kind of eloquence which is called oratory in France , and which has helped to make the French the worst politicians in Europe . Alas ! Mademoiselle , I fear that an English statesman would appear to you a very dull orator . ”
54844	54871	54676	54676	Isaura	536	“ I see that I spoke foolishly,—yes , you show me that the world of the statesman lies apart from that of the artist . Yet — ”
54872	54876	54676	54676	Isaura	536	“ Yet what ? ”
54877	54888	54541	54541	her	430	“ May not the ambition of both be the same ? ”
54889	54893	54676	54676	Isaura	536	“ How so ? ”
54894	54928	54676	54676	Isaura	536	“ To refine the rude , to exalt the mean ; to identify their own fame with some new beauty , some new glory , added to the treasure - house of all . ”
54950	54955	54956	54956	he	536	“ Oh , Mademoiselle , ”
54959	54986	54987	54987	He	536	“ what a sure guide and what a noble inspirer to a true Englishman ’s ambition nature has fitted you to be , were it not — ”
55060	55065	55041	55041	she	2362	“ Were it not , ”
55081	55088	55078	55078	she	2362	“ Were it not — what ? ”
55089	55092	55094	55094	Graham	536	“ Oh , ”
55102	55117	55078	55078	she	2362	“ I felt too ashamed of my selfishness as man to finish my sentence . ”
55118	55136	55041	55041	she	2362	“ Do so , or I shall fancy you refrained lest you might wound me as woman . ”
55137	55300	55301	55301	Isaura	536	“ Not so ; on the contrary , had I gone on it would have been to say that a woman of your genius , and more especially of such mastery in the most popular and fascinating of all arts , could not be contented if she inspired nobler thoughts in a single breast,—she must belong to the public , or rather the public must belong to her ; it is but a corner of her heart that an individual can occupy , and even that individual must merge his existence in hers , must be contented to reflect a ray of the light she sheds on admiring thousands . Who could dare to say to you , ‘ Renounce your career ; confine your genius , your art , to the petty circle of home ’ ? To an actress , a singer , with whose fame the world rings , home would be a prison . Pardon me , pardon — ”
55333	55339	55317	55317	she	2363	“ I am not offended . ”
55367	55416	55359	55359	he	536	“ Will you think it very impertinent in so new an acquaintance , if I ask how it is that you , an Italian , know our language as a native ; and is it by Italian teachers that you have been trained to think and to feel ? ”
55417	55474	55359	55359	he	536	“ Mr. Selby , my second father , was an Englishman , and did not speak any other language with comfort to himself . He was very fond of me ; and had he been really my father I could not have loved him more . We were constant companions till — till I lost him . ”
55475	55484	55485	55485	Isaura	536	“ And no mother left to console you ! ”
55626	55636	55621	55623	her Italian servant	2369	“ How beautiful the Signorina looks to - night ! ”
55959	55964	55952	55953	The Countess	1229	“ Cries of Liberty , ”
56744	56749	56741	56741	he	8604	“ Je me range , ”
57446	57450	57452	57453	the physician	2459	“ I hope , ”
57477	57503	57471	57471	his	431	wit,—“I hope that the fair Italian will not allow that ink - bottle imp to persuade her that she has fallen in love with him . ”
57504	57514	57516	57516	Graham	536	“ Do young ladies generally find him so seductive ? ”
57523	57558	57516	57516	Graham	536	“ Probably enough . He has the reputation of being very clever and very wicked , and that is a sort of character which has the serpent ’s fascination for the daughters of Eve . ”
57559	57565	57452	57453	the physician	2459	“ Is the reputation merited ? ”
57566	58044	57516	57516	Graham	536	“ As to the cleverness , I am not a fair judge . I dislike that sort of writing which is neither manlike nor womanlike , and in which young Rameau excels . He has the knack of finding very exaggerated phrases by which to express commonplace thoughts . He writes verses about love in words so stormy that you might fancy that Jove was descending upon Semele ; but when you examine his words , as a sober pathologist like myself is disposed to do , your fear for the peace of households vanishes,—they are Fox et proeterea nihil ; no man really in love would use them . He writes prose about the wrongs of humanity . You feel for humanity ; you say , ‘ Grant the wrongs , now for the remedy,’—and you find nothing but balderdash . Still I am bound to say that both in verse and prose Gustave Rameau is in unison with a corrupt taste of the day , and therefore he is coming into vogue . So much as to his writings ; as to his wickedness , you have only to look at him to feel sure that he is not a hundredth part so wicked as he wishes to seem . In a word , then , M. Gustave Rameau is a type of that somewhat numerous class among the youth of Paris , which I call ‘ the lost Tribe of Absinthe . ’ There is a set of men who begin to live full gallop while they are still boys . As a general rule , they are originally of the sickly frames which can scarcely even trot , much less gallop without the spur of stimulants , and no stimulant so fascinates their peculiar nervous system as absinthe . The number of patients in this set who at the age of thirty are more worn out than septuagenarians increases so rapidly as to make one dread to think what will be the next race of Frenchmen . To the predilection for absinthe young Rameau and the writers of his set add the imitation of Heine , after , indeed , the manner of caricaturists , who effect a likeness striking in proportion as it is ugly . It is not easy to imitate the pathos and the wit of Heine ; but it is easy to imitate his defiance of the Deity , his mockery of right and wrong , his relentless war on that heroic standard of thought and action which the writers who exalt their nation intuitively preserve . Rameau can not be a Heine , but he can be to Heine what a misshapen snarling dwarf is to a mangled blaspheming Titan . Yet he interests the women in general , and he evidently interests the fair Signorina in especial . ”

58419	58450	58402	58403	Gustave Rameau	551	“ A view of Sorrento , Monsieur , but it does not do justice to the place . I was pointing out the house which belonged to Tasso ’s father . ”

58485	58493	58470	58470	Isaura	536	“ Eleonora did not live at Sorrento . ”

58535	58551	58533	58533	Graham	536	“ that no one would have cared for Eleonora if it were not for Tasso . ”
58559	58585	58552	58552	Rameau	551	“ Pardon , Monsieur , in every age a love - story keeps its interest ; but who cares nowadays for le clinquant du Tasse ? ”
58586	58592	58594	58594	Isaura	536	“ Le clinquant du Tasse ! ”

58652	58656	58639	58639	I	0	” said Isaura . “
58659	58663	58664	58664	Monsieur	2487	” remarked Graham , “
58677	58678	58664	58664	Monsieur	2487	” “
58686	58690	58691	58691	I	0	” retorted Rameau , “
58722	58730	58731	58731	I	0	” Isaura laughed her pleasant silvery laugh . “
58772	58773	58764	58764	you	1758	” “
58896	58897	58892	58894	Madame de Grantmesnil	453	” “
58903	58909	58911	58913	Madame de Grantmesnil	453	” cried Graham , incredulously ; “
58917	58918	58911	58913	Madame de Grantmesnil	453	” “
58927	58968	58969	58969	Her	453	” Graham ’s face darkened ; he turned away in silence , and in another minute vanished from the room , persuading himself that he felt not one pang of jealousy in leaving Gustave Rameau by the side of Isaura . “
58976	59168	58969	58969	Her	453	” he muttered . A word now on Isaura ’s chief correspondent . Madame de Grantmesnil was a woman of noble birth and ample fortune . She had separated from her husband in the second year after marriage . She was a singularly eloquent writer , surpassed among contemporaries of her sex in popularity and renown only by Georges Sand . At least as fearless as that great novelist in the frank exposition of her views , she had commenced her career in letters by a work of astonishing power and pathos , directed against the institution of marriage as regulated in Roman Catholic communities . I do not know that it said more on this delicate subject than the English Milton has said ; but then Milton did not write for a Roman Catholic community , nor adopt a style likely to captivate the working classes . Madame de Grantmesnil ’s first book was deemed an attack on the religion of the country , and captivated those among the working classes who had already abjured that religion . This work was followed up by others more or less in defiance of “
59170	59713	59714	59714	I	0	opinions,”—some with political , some with social revolutionary aim and tendency , but always with a singular purity of style . Search all her books , and however you might revolt from her doctrine , you could not find a hazardous expression . The novels of English young ladies are naughty in comparison . Of late years , whatever might be hard or audacious in her political or social doctrines softened itself into charm amid the golden haze of romance . Her writings had grown more and more purely artistic,—poetizing what is good and beautiful in the realities of life rather than creating a false ideal out of what is vicious and deformed . Such a woman , separated young from her husband , could not enunciate such opinions and lead a life so independent and uncontrolled as Madame de Grantmesnil had done , without scandal , without calumny . Nothing , however , in her actual life had ever been so proved against her as to lower the high position she occupied in right of birth , fortune , renown . Wherever she went she was fetee , as in England foreign princes , and in America foreign authors , are fetes . Those who knew her well concurred in praise of her lofty , generous , lovable qualities . Madame de Grantmesnil had known Mr. Selby ; and when , at his death , Isaura , in the innocent age between childhood and youth , had been left the most sorrowful and most lonely creature on the face of the earth , this famous woman , worshipped by the rich for her intellect , adored by the poor for her beneficence , came to the orphan ’s friendless side , breathing love once more into her pining heart , and waking for the first time the desires of genius , the aspirations of art , in the dim self - consciousness of a soul between sleep and waking . But , my dear Englishman , put yourself in Graham ’s place , and suppose that you were beginning to fall in love with a girl whom for many good reasons you ought not to marry ; suppose that in the same hour in which you were angrily conscious of jealousy on account of a man whom it wounds your self - esteem to consider a rival , the girl tells you that her dearest friend is a woman who is famed for her hostility to the institution of marriage ! On the same day in which Graham dined with the Savarins , M. Louvier assembled round his table the elite of the young Parisians who constituted the oligarchy of fashion , to meet whom he had invited his new friend the Marquis de Rochebriant . Most of them belonged to the Legitimist party , the noblesse of the faubourg ; those who did not , belonged to no political party at all,—indifferent to the cares of mortal States as the gods of Epicurus . Foremost among this Jeunesse doree were Alain ’s kinsmen , Raoul and Enguerrand de Vandemar . To these Louvier introduced him with a burly parental bonhomie , as if he were the head of the family . “
59743	59997	59741	59741	friends	1591	” So saying he turned to his other guests . Almost in an instant Alain felt his constraint melt away in the cordial warmth with which his cousins greeted him . These young men had a striking family likeness to each other , and yet in feature , colouring , and expression , in all save that strange family likeness , they were contrasts . Raoul was tall , and , though inclined to be slender , with sufficient breadth of shoulder to indicate no inconsiderable strength of frame . His hair worn short and his silky beard worn long were dark ; so were his eyes , shaded by curved drooping lashes ; his complexion was pale , but clear and healthful . In repose the expression of his face was that of a somewhat melancholy indolence , but in speaking it became singularly sweet , with a smile of the exquisite urbanity which no artificial politeness can bestow ; it must emanate from that native high breeding which has its source in goodness of heart . Enguerrand was fair , with curly locks of a golden chestnut . He wore no beard , only a small mustache rather darker than his hair . His complexion might in itself be called effeminate , its bloom was so fresh and delicate ; but there was so much of boldness and energy in the play of his countenance , the hardy outline of the lips , and the open breadth of the forehead , that “
59999	60307	60308	60308	We	2506	” was an epithet no one ever assigned to his aspect . He was somewhat under the middle height , but beautifully proportioned , carried himself well , and somehow or other did not look short even by the side of tall men . Altogether he seemed formed to be a mother ’s darling , and spoiled by women , yet to hold his own among men with a strength of will more evident in his look and his bearing than it was in those of his graver and statelier brother . Both were considered by their young co - equals models in dress , but in Raoul there was no sign that care or thought upon dress had been bestowed ; the simplicity of his costume was absolute and severe . On his plain shirt - front there gleamed not a stud , on his fingers there sparkled not a ring . Enguerrand , on the contrary , was not without pretension in his attire ; the broderie in his shirt - front seemed woven by the Queen of the Fairies . His rings of turquoise and opal , his studs and wrist - buttons of pearl and brilliants , must have cost double the rental of Rochebriant , but probably they cost him nothing . He was one of those happy Lotharios to whom Calistas make constant presents . All about him was so bright that the atmosphere around seemed gayer for his presence . In one respect at least the brothers closely resembled each other,—in that exquisite graciousness of manner for which the genuine French noble is traditionally renowned ; a graciousness that did not desert them even when they came reluctantly into contact with roturiers or republicans ; but the graciousness became egalite , fraternite , towards one of their caste and kindred . “
60320	60335	60336	60337	Vilain cousin	2508	” said Raoul , still retaining in his grasp the hand he had taken . “
60339	60345	60336	60337	Vilain cousin	2508	” said the livelier Enguerrand , “
60362	60363	60336	60337	Vilain cousin	2508	” “
60376	60377	60374	60374	him	8236	” “
60381	60385	60378	60379	Our father	2510	” answered Raoul , “
60471	60910	60911	60911	I	0	” Before Alain could answer dinner was announced . Alain ’s place at dinner was between his cousins . How pleasant they made themselves ! It was the first time in which Alain had been brought into such familiar conversation with countrymen of his own rank as well as his own age . His heart warmed to them . The general talk of the other guests was strange to his ear ; it ran much upon horses and races , upon the opera and the ballet ; it was enlivened with satirical anecdotes of persons whose names were unknown to the Provincial ; not a word was said that showed the smallest interest in politics or the slightest acquaintance with literature . The world of these well - born guests seemed one from which all that concerned the great mass of mankind was excluded , yet the talk was that which could only be found in a very polished society . In it there was not much wit , but there was a prevalent vein of gayety , and the gayety was never violent , the laughter was never loud ; the scandals circulated might imply cynicism the most absolute , but in language the most refined . The Jockey Club of Paris has its perfume . Raoul did not mix in the general conversation ; he devoted himself pointedly to the amusement of his cousin , explaining to him the point of the anecdotes circulated , or hitting off in terse sentences the characters of the talkers . Enguerrand was evidently of temper more vivacious than his brother , and contributed freely to the current play of light gossip and mirthful sally . Louvier , seated between a duke and a Russian prince , said little except to recommend a wine or an entree , but kept his eye constantly on the Vandemars and Alain . Immediately after coffee the guests departed . Before they did so , however , Raoul introduced his cousin to those of the party most distinguished by hereditary rank or social position . With these the name of Rochebriant was too historically famous not to insure respect of its owner ; they welcomed him among them as if he were their brother . The French duke claimed him as a connection by an alliance in the fourteenth century ; the Russian prince had known the late Marquis , and trusted that the son would allow him to improve into friendship the acquaintance he had formed with the father . Those ceremonials over , Raoul linked his arm in Alain ’s and said : “
61041	61138	61039	61039	her	1208	” That dinner at M. Louvier ’s had already effected a great change in the mood and temper of Alain de Rochebriant ; he felt , as if by magic , the sense of youth , of rank , of station , which had been so suddenly checked and stifled , warmed to life within his veins . He should have deemed himself a boor had he refused the invitation so frankly tendered . But on reaching the coupe which the brothers kept in common , and seeing it only held two , he drew back . “
61146	61157	61158	61158	Enguerrand	564	” said Raoul , divining the cause of his hesitation ; “
61166	61167	61158	61158	Enguerrand	564	” “
61171	61182	61158	61158	Enguerrand	564	” said Raoul , when they were in the carriage , “
61191	61192	61193	61193	He	564	” “
61199	61200	61193	61193	He	564	” “
61223	61224	61215	61216	the man	8507	” “
61243	61244	61258	61258	he	8236	” “
61261	61262	61263	61263	He	8236	” “
61289	61290	61291	61291	He	8236	” “
61323	61346	61317	61321	the head of our house	2532	” answered Raoul , with a certain nobleness of tone and manner . Alain pressed his kinsman ’s hand with grateful emotion . “
61349	61354	61355	61356	your father	8236	” he said falteringly , “
61369	61370	61355	61356	your father	8236	” “
61373	61382	61355	61356	your father	8236	” interrupted Raoul , with a gentle laugh ; “
61459	61566	61446	61446	Enguerrand	564	” The Contessa di Rimini received her visitors in a boudoir furnished with much apparent simplicity , but a simplicity by no means inexpensive . The draperies were but of chintz , and the walls covered with the same material,—a lively pattern , in which the prevalents were rose - colour and white ; but the ornaments on the mantelpiece , the china stored in the cabinets or arranged on the shelves , the small knickknacks scattered on the tables , were costly rarities of art . The Contessa herself was a woman who had somewhat passed her thirtieth year,—not strikingly handsome , but exquisitely pretty . “
61570	61577	61446	61446	Enguerrand	564	” said a great French writer , “
61601	61645	61596	61596	she	1546	” and it would be impossible to reckon up the number of ways in which Adeline di Rimini carried off the prize in prettiness . Yet it would be unjust to the personal attractions of the Contessa to class them all under the word “
61648	61743	61744	61744	I	0	” When regarded more attentively , there was an expression in her countenance that might almost be called divine , it spoke so unmistakably of a sweet nature and an untroubled soul . An English poet once described her by repeating the old lines , She was not alone ; an elderly lady sat on an armchair by the fire , engaged in knitting ; and a man , also elderly , and whose dress proclaimed him an ecclesiastic , sat at the opposite corner , with a large Angora cat on his lap . “
61751	61755	61749	61749	Madame	453	” said Raoul , “
61803	61850	61851	61851	I	0	” The Contessa replied very graciously to this introduction , and made room for Alain on the divan from which she had risen . The old lady looked up from her knitting ; the ecclesiastic removed the cat from his lap . Said the old lady , “
61898	61899	61881	61884	a cavalier si beau	2552	” “
61902	61906	61907	61911	the woman in all Paris	2553	” interrupted Raoul , “
61999	62000	61984	61984	his	572	” “
62004	62025	62001	62002	Base flatterer	2559	” said the Abbe , pinching Raoul ’s ear with one hand , while he extended the other to Alain . “
62236	62316	62317	62318	Monsieur L’Abbe	573	” The Abbe delivered this oration with a gravity of mien and tone which made it difficult to guess whether he spoke in sport or in earnest , in simple playfulness or with latent sarcasm . But on the brow and in the eye of the priest there was a general expression of quiet benevolence , which made Alain incline to the belief that he was only speaking as a pleasant humourist ; and the Marquis replied gayly , — “
62380	62418	62373	62373	you	2567	” This sally , which showed that the Marquis was already shaking off his provincial reserve , met with great success . Raoul and the Contessa laughed merrily ; Madame de Maury clapped her hands , and cried “
62421	62430	62373	62373	you	2567	” The Abbe replied , with unmoved gravity , “
62469	62527	62462	62462	you	2567	” Here he handed to Alain a memorial on behalf of an afflicted family who had been burnt out of their home , and reduced from comparative ease to absolute want . There was a list appended of some twenty subscribers , the last being the Contessa , fifty francs , and Madame de Maury , five . “
62533	62538	62529	62529	me	0	” said the Abbe , “
62553	62563	62550	62551	mon fils	2572	” ( taking the napoleon Alain extended to him ) “
62600	62618	62619	62619	Abbe	572	” Raoul made a sign to the Abbe , unperceived by the rest , as he answered , “
62641	62668	62669	62669	Niggard	575	” Alain felt to the bottom of his heart the delicate tact of his richer kinsman in giving less than himself , and the Abbe replied , “
62702	62704	62669	62669	Niggard	575	” The “
62707	62840	62841	62841	I	0	” was now served in what at Paris is called the English fashion ; the Contessa presided over it , the guests gathered round the table , and the evening passed away in the innocent gayety of a domestic circle . The talk , if not especially intellectual , was at least not fashionable . Books were not discussed , neither were scandals ; yet somehow or other it was cheery and animated , like that of a happy family in a country - house . Alain thought still the better of Raoul that , Parisian though he was , he could appreciate the charm of an evening so innocently spent . On taking leave , the Contessa gave Alain a general invitation to drop in whenever he was not better engaged . “
62848	62852	62853	62853	My	0	” said she . “
62881	62890	62876	62876	I	0	” Raoul set Alain down at his lodgings . “
62903	62915	62899	62899	Enguerrand	564	” Raul and Enguerrand called on Alain at the hour fixed . “
62921	62925	62926	62926	I	0	” said Raoul , “
63011	63065	63005	63005	I	0	” Alain , as briefly as he could , stated his circumstances , his mortgages , and the hopes which his avow had encouraged him to place in the friendly disposition of M. Louvier . When he had concluded , Enguerrand mused for a few moments before replying . At last he said , “
63412	63487	63488	63488	Bref	579	“ Besides , Louvier himself in his youth set up for a dandy ; and that deposed ruler of dandies , our unfortunate kinsman , Victor de Mauleon , shed some of his own radiance on the money - lender ’s son . But when Victor ’s star was eclipsed , Louvier ceased to gleam . The dandies cut him . In his heart he exults that the dandies now throng to his soirees . “
63553	63554	63545	63545	I	0	” “
63559	63563	63545	63545	I	0	” said Raoul . “
63574	63587	63569	63569	he	564	” he added , with a smile half sad , half tender , “
63597	63598	63599	63599	I	0	” “
63611	63615	63599	63599	I	0	” said Alain . “

63637	63656	63657	63657	You	0	” he was about to add , but wisely checked himself . Enguerrand said , shrugging his shoulders , “
63686	63694	63673	63673	I	0	” he said , and was gone . “
63703	63715	63673	63673	I	0	” said Raoul , flinging away the end of his cigar , “
63755	63756	63747	63747	He	564	” “
63759	63767	63768	63768	I	0	” replied Alain , with a sigh , “
63797	63798	63799	63799	I	0	” “
63807	63811	63799	63799	I	0	” said Raoul . “
64110	64240	64064	64064	Rochebriant	351	“ Condemned to a career of pleasure and frivolity , we can scarcely escape from the contagion of extravagant luxury which forms the vice of the time . With grand names to keep up , and small fortunes whereon to keep them , we readily incur embarrassment and debt . Then neediness conquers pride . We can not be great merchants , but we can be small gamblers on the Bourse , or , thanks to the Credit Mobilier , imitate a cabinet minister , and keep a shop under another name . Perhaps you have heard that Enguerrand and I keep a shop . Pray , buy your gloves there . Strange fate for men whose ancestors fought in the first Crusade — mais que voulez - vous ? ”
64241	64249	64251	64251	Alain	351	“ I was told of the shop , ”
64253	64265	64064	64064	Rochebriant	351	“ but the moment I knew you I disbelieved the story . ”
64266	64499	64064	64064	Rochebriant	351	“ Quite true . Shall I confide to you why we resorted to that means of finding ourselves in pocket - money ? My father gives us rooms in his hotel ; the use of his table , which we do not much profit by ; and an allowance , on which we could not live as young men of our class live at Paris . Enguerrand had his means of spending pocket - money , I mine ; but it came to the same thing,—the pockets were emptied . We incurred debts . Two years ago my father straitened himself to pay them , saying , ‘ The next time you come to me with debts , however small , you must pay them yourselves , or you must marry , and leave it to me to find you wives . ’ This threat appalled us both . A month afterwards , Enguerrand made a lucky hit at the Bourse , and proposed to invest the proceeds in a shop . I resisted as long as I could ; but Enguerrand triumphed over me , as he always does . He found an excellent deputy in a bonne who had nursed us in childhood , and married a journeyman perfumer who understands the business . It answers well ; we are not in debt , and we have preserved our freedom . ”
64561	64572	64558	64558	he	2637	“ Bon jour ; excuse me if I derange you . ”
64610	64617	64618	64618	he	2637	“ Peste , my dear Marquis ! ”
64623	64651	64618	64618	he	2637	“ I hope the next time I visit you the ascent may be less arduous . One would think you were in training to ascend the Himalaya . ”
64672	64697	64669	64669	his	2637	“ I am accustomed to dwell on heights , Monsieur Louvier ; the castle of Rochebriant is not on a level with the town . ”
64722	64862	64863	64863	He	2643	“ Bien dit , mon cher ; how you remind me of your father ! Now , give me leave to speak on affairs . I have seen your cousin Enguerrand de Vandemar . Homme de moyens , though joli garcon . He proposed that you should call on me . I said ‘ no ’ to the cher petit Enguerrand,—a visit from me was due to you . To cut matters short , M. Gandrin has allowed me to look into your papers . I was disposed to serve you from the first ; I am still more disposed to serve you now . I undertake to pay off all your other mortgages , and become sole mortgagee , and on terms that I have jotted down on this paper , and which I hope will content you . ”
65026	65031	65033	65033	Louvier	399	“ Well , Marquis , ”

65061	65121	65052	65052	Alain	351	“ accept my sincere apologies for the indiscretion of my metaphor . Poverty is proverbially sensitive to jests on it . I owe it to you if I can not hereafter make that excuse for any words of mine that may displease you . The terms you propose are most liberal , and I close with them at once . ”
65122	65125	65127	65127	Louvier	399	“ Bon , ”
65137	65374	65127	65127	Louvier	399	“ I will take the paper to Gandrin , and instruct him accordingly . And now , may I attach a condition to the agreement which is not put down on paper ? It may have surprised you perhaps that I should propose a gratuity of 25,000 francs on completion of the contract . It is a droll thing to do , and not in the ordinary way of business , therefore I must explain . Marquis , pardon the liberty I take , but you have inspired me with an interest in your future . With your birth , connections , and figure you should push your way in the world far and fast . But you ca n’t do so in a province . You must find your opening at Paris . I wish you to spend a year in the capital , and live , not extravagantly , like a nouveau riche , but in a way not unsuited to your rank , and permitting you all the social advantages that belong to it . These 25,000 francs , in addition to your improved income , will enable you to gratify my wish in this respect . Spend the money in Paris ; you will want every sou of it in the course of the year . It will be money well spent . Take my advice , cher Marquis . Au plaisir . ”
66005	66075	66000	66001	M. Renard	470	“ Monsieur , this affair is beyond me ; the keenest agent of our police could make nothing of it . Unless you can tell me more than you have done , I am utterly without a clew . I resign , therefore , the task with which you honoured me , willing to resume it again if you can give me information that could render me of use . ”
66076	66082	66000	66001	M. Renard	470	“ What sort of information ? ”
66083	66101	66000	66001	M. Renard	470	“ At least the names of some of the lady ’s relations who may yet be living . ”
66102	66151	66000	66001	M. Renard	470	“ But it strikes me that , if I could get at that piece of knowledge , I should not require the services of the police . The relations would tell me what had become of Louise Duval quite as readily as they would tell a police agent . ”
66152	66199	66000	66001	M. Renard	470	“ Quite true , Monsieur . It would really be picking your pockets if I did not at once retire from your service . Nay , Monsieur , pardon me , no further payments ; I have already accepted too much . Your most obedient servant . ”
66449	66487	66445	66447	M. Frederic Lemercier	352	“ Cher Grarm - Varn . A thousand pardons if I disturb you at this late hour of the evening ; but you remember the request you made me when you first arrived in Paris this season ? ”
66488	66568	66445	66447	M. Frederic Lemercier	352	“ Of course I do,—in case you should ever chance in your wide round of acquaintance to fall in with a Madame or Mademoiselle Duval of about the age of forty , or a year or so less , to let me know ; and you did fall in with two ladies of that name , but they were not the right one , not the person whom my friend begged me to discover ; both much too young . ”
66569	66663	66445	66447	M. Frederic Lemercier	352	“ Eh bien , mon cher . If you will come with me to the bal champetre in the Champs Elysees to - night , I can show you a third Madame Duval,—her Christian name is Louise , too , of the age you mention,—though she does her best to look younger , and is still very handsome . You said your Duval was handsome . It was only last evening that I met this lady at a soiree given by Mademoiselle Julie Caumartin , coryphee distinguee , in love with young Rameau . ”
66664	66684	66445	66447	M. Frederic Lemercier	352	“ In love with young Rameau ? I am very glad to hear it . He returns the love ? ”
66685	66741	66445	66447	M. Frederic Lemercier	352	“ I suppose so . He seems very proud of it . But apropos of Madame Duval , she has been long absent from Paris , just returned , and looking out for conquests . She says she has a great penchant for the English ; promises me to be at this ball . Come . ”
66742	66756	66445	66447	M. Frederic Lemercier	352	“ Hearty thanks , my dear Lemercier . I am at your service . ”

67072	67160	67053	67053	He	536	“ Who ? Do n’t you know ? That is Julie Caumartin . A little while ago her equipage was the most admired in the Bois , and great ladies condescended to copy her dress or her coiffure ; but she has lost her splendour , and dismissed the rich admirer who supplied the fuel for its blaze , since she fell in love with Gustave Rameau . Doubtless she is expecting him to - night . You ought to know her ; shall I present you ? ”
67161	67164	67166	67166	Graham	536	“ No , ”
67177	67190	67166	67166	Graham	536	“ So young ; seemingly so gay . How I pity her ! ”
67191	67257	67053	67053	He	536	“ What ! for throwing herself away on Rameau ? True . There is a great deal of good in that girl ’s nature , if she had been properly trained . Rameau wrote a pretty poem on her which turned her head and won her heart , in which she is styled the ‘ Ondine of Paris,’—a nymph - like type of Paris itself . ”
67258	67278	67280	67280	Graham	536	“ Vanishing type , like her namesake ; born of the spray , and vanishing soon into the deep , ”
67282	67298	67280	67280	Graham	536	“ Pray go and look for the Duval ; you will find me seated yonder . ”
67401	67418	67390	67399	the lady , with whom Frederic then discreetly left him	2698	“ M. Lemercier tells me that you think that we were once acquainted with each other . ”
67419	67487	67371	67375	the Louise Duval he sought	2697	“ Nay , Madame ; I should not fail to recognize you were that the case . A friend of mine had the honour of knowing a lady of your name ; and should I be fortunate enough to meet that lady , I am charged with a commission that may not be unwelcome to her . M. Lemercier tells me your nom de bapteme is Louise . ”
67488	67494	67566	67566	she	2699	“ Louise Corinne , Monsieur . ”
67495	67510	67390	67399	the lady , with whom Frederic then discreetly left him	2698	“ And I presume that Duval is the name you take from your parents ? ”
67511	67541	67371	67375	the Louise Duval he sought	2697	“ No ; my father ’s name was Bernard . I married , when I was a mere child , M. Duval , in the wine trade at Bordeaux . ”
67542	67547	67549	67549	Graham	536	“ Ah , indeed ! ”
67585	67595	67596	67596	he	536	“ You know English , I think , Madame , ”
67605	67613	67596	67596	he	536	“ A leetle ; speak un peu . ”
67614	67619	67620	67621	Madame Duval	586	“ Only a little ? ”
67634	67680	67620	67621	Madame Duval	586	“ Is it that you were told that I spoke English by your countryman , Milord Sare Boulby ? Petit scelerat , I hope he is well . He sends you a commission for me,—so he ought ; he behaved to me like a monster . ”
67681	67699	67596	67596	he	536	“ Alas ! I know nothing of Milord Sir Boulby . Were you never in England yourself ? ”
67700	67703	67620	67621	Madame Duval	586	“ Never , ”
67711	67754	67620	67621	Madame Duval	586	“ I should like so much to go . I have a foible for the English in spite of that vilain petit Boulby . Who is it gave you the commission for me ? Ha ! I guess , le Capitaine Nelton . ”
67755	67776	67596	67596	he	536	“ No . What year , Madame , if not impertinent , were you at Aix - la - Chapelle ? ”
67777	67802	67596	67596	he	536	“ You mean Baden ? I was there seven years ago , when I met le Capitaine Nelton , bel homme aux cheveux rouges . ”
67803	67811	67620	67621	Madame Duval	586	“ But you have been at Aix ? ”
67812	67815	67596	67596	he	536	“ Never . ”
67816	67837	67596	67596	he	536	“ I have , then , been mistaken , Madame , and have only to offer my most humble apologies . ”
67838	67889	67620	67621	Madame Duval	586	“ But perhaps you will favour me with a visit , and we may on further conversation find that you are not mistaken . I ca n’t stay now , for I am engaged to dance with the Belgian of whom , no doubt , M. Lemercier has told you . ”
67890	67899	67620	67621	Madame Duval	586	“ No , Madame , he has not . ”
67900	67932	67933	67933	Graham	536	“ Well , then , he will tell you . The Belgian is very jealous ; but I am always at home between three and four ; this is my card . ”
67942	67953	67933	67933	Graham	536	“ Is this you ’re your own handwriting , Madame ? ”
67954	67959	67620	67621	Madame Duval	586	“ Yes , indeed . ”
67960	67965	67967	67967	Graham	536	“ Tres belle ecriture , ”
67976	67986	67988	67989	the Englishman	8366	“ Anything so unlike her handwriting ! Another disappointment , ”
68017	68020	68022	68022	Lemercier	595	“ Well , ”
68031	68045	68022	68022	Lemercier	595	“ I hit the right nail on the head this time , eh ? ”
68051	68062	68048	68048	his	536	“ What ! is she not the right Louise Duval ? ”
68063	68067	68068	68071	The Count de Passy	543	“ Certainly not . ”
68079	68083	68084	68084	he	543	“ Louise Duval , ”
68087	68096	68084	68084	he	543	“ does Monsieur Vane know a Louise Duval ? ”
68097	68123	68124	68125	The Count	8604	“ No ; but a friend asked me to inquire after a lady of that name whom he had met many years ago at Paris . ”
68133	68146	68124	68125	The Count	8604	“ Is it possible that your friend knew the family De Mauleon ? ”
68147	68157	68084	68084	he	543	“ I really ca n’t say . What then ? ”
68158	68202	68084	68084	he	543	“ The old Vicomte de Mauleon was one of my most intimate associates . In fact , our houses are connected . And he was extremely grieved , poor man , when his daughter Louise married her drawing - master , Auguste Duval . ”
68203	68272	68084	68084	he	543	“ Her drawing - master , Auguste Duval ? Pray say on . I think the Louise Duval my friend knew must have been her daughter . She was the only child of a drawing - master or artist named Auguste Duval , and probably enough her Christian name would have been derived from her mother . A Mademoiselle de Mauleon , then , married M. Auguste Duval ? ”
68273	68395	68397	68398	the Count	8604	“ Yes ; the old Vicomte had espoused en premieres noces Mademoiselle Camille de Chavigny , a lady of birth equal to his own ; had by her one daughter , Louise . I recollect her well,—a plain girl , with a high nose and a sour expression . She was just of age when the first Vicomtesse died , and by the marriage settlement she succeeded at once to her mother ’s fortune , which was not large . The Vicomte was , however , so poor that the loss of that income was no trifle to him . Though much past fifty , he was still very handsome . Men of that generation did not age soon , Monsieur , ”
68408	68551	68401	68401	his	8604	“ He married , en secondes noces , a lady of still higher birth than the first , and with a much larger dot . Louise was indignant at this , hated her stepmother ; and when a son was born by the second marriage she left the paternal roof , went to reside with an old female relative near the Luxembourg , and there married this drawing - master . Her father and the family did all they could to prevent it ; but in these democratic days a woman who has attained her majority can , if she persist in her determination , marry to please herself and disgrace her ancestors . After that mesalliance her father never would see her again . I tried in vain to soften him . All his parental affections settled on his handsome Victor . “

69064	69170	69026	69029	that same young lady	2729	” Graham still continued to question , but could learn no further particulars . He turned to quit the gardens just as the band was striking up for a fresh dance , a wild German waltz air ; and mingled with that German music his ear caught the sprightly sounds of the French laugh , one laugh distinguished from the rest by a more genuine ring of light - hearted joy , the laugh that he had heard on entering the gardens , and the sound of which had then saddened him . Looking towards the quarter from which it came , he again saw the “
69175	69248	69026	69029	that same young lady	2729	” She was not now the centre of a group . She had just found Gustave Rameau , and was clinging to his arm with a look of happiness in her face , frank and innocent as a child ’s ; and so they passed amid the dancers down a solitary lamplit alley , till lost to the Englishman ’s lingering gaze . The next morning Graham sent again for M. Renard . “

69514	69662	69470	69471	the mother	2732	“ But before , by the death of his parents , Victor came into that inheritance , he very largely forestalled it . His tastes were magnificent . He took to ‘ sport , ’ kept a famous stud , was a great favourite with the English , and spoke their language fluently . Indeed he was considered very accomplished , and of considerable intellectual powers . It was generally said that some day or other , when he had sown his wild oats , he would , if he took to politics , be an eminent man . Altogether he was a very strong creature . That was a very strong age under Louis Philippe . The viveurs of Paris were fine types for the heroes of Dumas and Sue,—full of animal life and spirits . Victor de Mauleon was a romance of Dumas , incarnated . ”

69684	69845	69470	69471	the mother	2732	“ Monsieur , a man in my profession does not attain even to my humble eminence if he be not something else than a professional . He must study mankind wherever they are described , even in les romans . To return to Victor de Mauleon . Though he was a ‘ sportman , ’ a gambler , a Don Juan , a duel list , nothing was ever said against his honour . On the contrary , on matters of honour he was a received oracle ; and even though he had fought several duels ( that was the age of duels ) , and was reported without a superior , almost without an equal , in either weapon , the sword or the pistol , he is said never to have wantonly provoked an encounter , and to have so used his skill that he contrived never to slay , nor even gravely to wound , an antagonist . “

70806	70990	70789	70789	he	522	“ No evidence in support of any other charge against the Vicomte was forthcoming,—nothing , in short , beyond the infraction du domicile caused by the madness of youthful love , and for which there was no prosecution . The law , therefore , could have little to say against him . But society was more rigid ; and exceedingly angry to find that a man who had been so conspicuous for luxury should prove to be a pauper , insisted on believing that M. de Mauleon was guilty of the meaner , though not perhaps , in the eyes of husbands and fathers , the more heinous , of the two offences . I presume that the Vicomte felt that he had got into a dilemma from which no pistol - shot or sword - thrust could free him , for he left Paris abruptly , and has not since reappeared . The sale of his stud and effects sufficed , I believe , to pay his debts , for I will do him the justice to say that they were paid . ”
70991	71023	70761	70761	he	522	“ But though the Vicomte de Mauleon has disappeared , he must have left relations at Paris , who would perhaps know what has become of him and of his niece . ”
71024	71194	70789	70789	he	522	“ I doubt it . He had no very near relations . The nearest was an old celibataire of the same name , from whom he had some expectations , but who died shortly after this esclandre , and did not name the Vicomte in his will . M. Victor had numerous connections among the highest families , the Rochebriants , Chavignys , Vandemars , Passys , Beauvilliers ; but they are not likely to have retained any connection with a ruined vaurien , and still less with a niece of his who was the child of a drawing - master . But now you have given me a clew , I will try to follow it up . We must find the Vicomte , and I am not without hope of doing so . Pardon me if I decline to say more at present . I would not raise false expectations ; but in a week or two I will have the honour to call again upon Monsieur . ”
71195	71211	70789	70789	he	522	“ Wait one instant . You have really a hope of discovering M. de Mauleon ? ”

If the meeting of lovers should be sacred from the intrusion of a third person , however amiable , more sacred still should be the parting between an author and his work . Madame de Grantmesnil is in that moment so solemn to a genius earnest as hers,—she is bidding farewell to a companion with whom , once dismissed into the world , she can never converse familiarly again ; it ceases to be her companion when it becomes ours .

Probably both are so well known as to convict me of a barbarous ignorance . ”
74962	74967	74969	74969	Isaura	536	“ Oh , no , ”
74984	75033	74969	74969	Isaura	536	“ Both the words and music are by an unknown and very humble composer , yet not , indeed , quite original,—they have not even that merit ; at least they were suggested by a popular song in the Neapolitan dialect which is said to be very old . ”
75034	75073	74878	74878	Graham	536	“ I do n’t know if I caught the true meaning of the words , for they seemed to me to convey a more subtle and refined sentiment than is common in the popular songs of southern Italy . ”
75074	75097	74878	74878	Graham	536	“ The sentiment in the original is changed in the paraphrase , and not , I fear , improved by the change . ”
75098	75117	74969	74969	Isaura	536	“ Will you explain to me the sentiment in both , and let me judge which I prefer ? ”
75118	75271	75273	75273	Isaura	536	“ In the Neapolitan song a young fisherman , who has moored his boat under a rock on the shore , sees a beautiful face below the surface of the waters ; he imagines it to be that of a Nereid , and casts in his net to catch this supposed nymph of the ocean . He only disturbs the water , loses the image , and brings up a few common fishes . He returns home disappointed , and very much enamoured of the supposed Nereid . The next day he goes again to the same place , and discovers that the face which had so charmed him was that of a mortal girl reflected on the waters from the rock behind him , on which she had been seated , and on which she had her home . The original air is arch and lively ; just listen to it . ”
75294	75297	75299	75299	Graham	536	“ That , ”
75301	75323	75299	75299	Graham	536	“ is a different music indeed from the other , which is deep and plaintive , and goes to the heart . ”
75324	75418	75273	75273	Isaura	536	“ But do you not see how the words have been altered ? In the song you first heard me singing , the fisherman goes again to the spot , again and again sees the face in the water , again and again seeks to capture the Nereid , and never knows to the last that the face was that of the mortal on the rock close behind him , and which he passed by without notice every day . Deluded by an ideal image , the real one escapes from his eye . ”
75419	75434	75299	75299	Graham	536	“ Is the verse that is recast meant to symbolize a moral in love ? ”
75435	75457	75273	75273	Isaura	536	“ In love ? nay , I know not ; but in life , yes,—at least the life of the artist . ”
75458	75567	75568	75568	Isaura	536	“ The paraphrase of the original is yours , Signorina , words and music both . Am I not right ? Your silence answers ‘ Yes . ’ Will you pardon me if I say that , though there can be no doubt of the new beauty you have given to the old song , I think that the moral of the old was the sounder one , the truer to human life . We do not go on to the last duped by an allusion . If enamoured by the shadow on the waters , still we do look around us and discover the image it reflects . ”
75629	75646	75648	75648	Graham	536	“ Despise the coming May flowers if you will , they will soon be so plentiful , ”
75650	75675	75648	75648	Graham	536	“ but do not cast away the few blossoms which winter has so kindly spared , and which even summer will not give again ; ”
75709	75734	75735	75735	she	2931	“ The sun has left this side of the garden , the east wind is rising , and you must find it chilly here , ”
75743	75752	75735	75735	she	2931	“ will you not come into the house ? ”
75753	75764	75766	75766	Graham	536	“ It is not the air that I feel chilly , ”
75774	75786	75766	75766	Graham	536	“ I almost fear that my prosaic admonitions have displeased you . ”
75787	75801	75802	75802	she	2931	“ They were not prosaic ; and they were kind and very wise , ”
75852	75864	75836	75836	He	536	“ Once or twice we have been there of an evening . ”
75865	75882	75836	75836	He	536	“ And encountered , no doubt , the illustrious young minstrel who despises Tasso and Corneille ? ”
75883	75932	75836	75836	He	536	“ M. Rameau ? Oh , yes ; he is constantly at the Savarins . Do not be severe on him . He is unhappy , he is struggling , he is soured . An artist has thorns in his path which lookers - on do not heed . ”
75933	76031	76032	76032	Graham	536	“ All people have thorns in their path , and I have no great respect for those who want lookers - on to heed them whenever they are scratched . But M. Rameau seems to me one of those writers very common nowadays , in France and even in England ; writers who have never read anything worth studying , and are , of course , presumptuous in proportion to their ignorance . I should not have thought an artist like yourself could have recognized an artist in a M. Rameau who despises Tasso without knowing Italian . ”
76042	76068	76036	76036	he	536	“ Are you not an artist yourself ? Are you not a writer ? M. Savarin told me you were a distinguished man of letters . ”
76069	76228	75836	75836	He	536	“ M. Savarin flatters me too much . I am not an artist , and I have a great dislike to that word as it is now hackneyed and vulgarized in England and in France . A cook calls himself an artist ; a tailor does the same ; a man writes a gaudy melodrame , a spasmodic song , a sensational novel , and straightway he calls Himself an artist , and indulges in a pedantic jargon about ‘ essence ’ and ‘ form , ’ assuring us that a poet we can understand wants essence , and a poet we can scan wants form . Thank heaven , I am not vain enough to call myself artist . I have written some very dry lucubrations in periodicals , chiefly political , or critical upon other subjects than art . But why , a propos of M. Rameau , did you ask me that question respecting myself ? ”
76229	76236	76238	76238	Isaura	536	“ Because much in your conversation , ”
76246	76458	76238	76238	Isaura	536	“ made me suppose you had more sympathies with art and its cultivators than you cared to avow ; and if you had such sympathies , you would comprehend what a relief it is to a poor aspirant to art like myself to come into communication with those who devote themselves to any art distinct from the common pursuits of the world , what a relief it is to escape from the ordinary talk of society . There is a sort of instinctive freemasonry among us , including masters and disciples ; and one art has a fellowship with other arts . Mine is but song and music , yet I feel attracted towards a sculptor , a painter , a romance - writer , a poet , as much as towards a singer , a musician . Do you understand why I can not contemn M. Rameau as you do ? I differ from his tastes in literature ; I do not much admire such of his writings as I have read ; I grant that he overestimates his own genius , whatever that be,—yet I like to converse with him . He is a struggler upwards , though with weak wings , or with erring footsteps , like myself . ”
76459	76462	76464	76464	Graham	536	“ Mademoiselle , ”
76468	76491	76492	76492	he	536	“ I can not say how I thank you for this candour . Do not condemn me for abusing it , if — ”
76495	76499	76492	76492	he	536	“ If what ? ”
76500	76750	76752	76752	he	2935	“ If I , so much older than yourself,—I do not say only in years , but in the experience of life , I whose lot is cast among those busy and ‘ positive ’ pursuits , which necessarily quicken that unromantic faculty called common - sense,—if , I say , the deep interest with which you must inspire all whom you admit into an acquaintance even as unfamiliar as that now between us makes me utter one caution , such as might be uttered by a friend or brother . Beware of those artistic sympathies which you so touchingly confess ; beware how , in the great events of life , you allow fancy to misguide your reason . In choosing friends on whom to rely , separate the artist from the human being . Judge of the human being for what it is in itself . Do not worship the face on the waters , blind to the image on the rock . In one word , never see in an artist like a M. Rameau the human being to whom you could intrust the destinies of your life . Pardon me , pardon me ; we may meet little hereafter , but you are a creature so utterly new to me , so wholly unlike any woman I have ever before encountered and admired , and to me seem endowed with such wealth of mind and soul , exposed to such hazard , that — that — ”
76761	76796	76760	76760	he	2935	concluded—“that it would be a deep sorrow to me if , perhaps years hence , I should have to say , ‘ Alas ’ ! by what mistake has that wealth been wasted ! ’ ”
76873	76877	76878	76878	he	536	“ Forgive me , ”
76887	76912	76878	76878	he	536	“ I have had no right to talk thus ; but it was not from want of respect ; it was — it was — ”
76928	76931	76933	76933	Isaura	536	“ Forgive ! ”
76935	76958	76933	76933	Isaura	536	“ do you think that I , an orphan , have never longed for a friend who would speak to me thus ? ”
77015	77018	77019	77019	he	536	“ Alas ! ”
77028	77178	77019	77019	he	536	“ you may remember , when we have before conversed , how I , though so uncultured in your art , still recognized its beautiful influence upon human breasts ; how I sought to combat your own depreciation of its rank among the elevating agencies of humanity ; how , too , I said that no man could venture to ask you to renounce the boards , the lamps,—resign the fame of actress , of singer . Well , now that you accord to me the title of friend , now that you so touchingly remind me that you are an orphan , thinking of all the perils the young and the beautiful of your sex must encounter when they abandon private life for public , I think that a true friend might put the question , ‘ Can you resign the fame of actress , of singer ? ’ ”
77179	77277	77278	77278	Graham	536	“ I will answer you frankly . The profession which once seemed to me so alluring began to lose its charms in my eyes some months ago . It was your words , very eloquently expressed , on the ennobling effects of music and song upon a popular audience , that counteracted the growing distaste to rendering up my whole life to the vocation of the stage ; but now I think I should feel grateful to the friend whose advice interpreted the voice of my own heart , and bade me relinquish the career of actress . ”
77486	77553	77481	77481	he	536	“ But am I yet in the position to hold myself wholly free ? Am I , am I ? Were the sole choice before me that between her and ambition and wealth , how soon it would be made ! Ambition has no prize equal to the heart of such a woman ; wealth no sources of joy equal to the treasures of her love . ”

He can not be one of the stars with which I have established familiar acquaintance , associated with fancies and dreams and hopes , as most of us do , for instance , with Hesperus , the moon ’s harbinger and comrade . But amid all those stars there is one — not Hesperus — which has always had from my childhood a mysterious fascination for me . Knowing as little of astrology as I do of astronomy , when I gaze upon that star I become credulously superstitious , and fancy it has an influence on my life . Have you , too , any favourite star ? ”
83247	83250	83252	83252	Isaura	536	“ Yes , ”
83254	83276	83252	83252	Isaura	536	“ and I distinguish it now , but I do not even know its name , and never would ask it . ”
83277	83339	83340	83340	Isaura	536	“ So like me . I would not vulgarize my unknown source of beautiful illusions by giving it the name it takes in technical catalogues . For fear of learning that name I never have pointed it out to any one before . I too at this moment distinguish it apart from all its brotherhood . Tell me which is yours . ”

84669	84679	84681	84681	Graham	536	“ You have discovered the uncle of Louise Duval ! ”
84683	84698	84681	84681	Graham	536	“ of course you mean M. de Mauleon , and he is at Paris ? ”
84699	85844	84663	84663	he	536	“ True so far , Monsieur ; but do not be too sanguine as to the results of the information I can give you . Permit me , as briefly as possible , to state the circumstances . When you acquainted me with the fact that M. de Mauleon was the uncle of Louise Duval , I told you that I was not without hopes of finding him out , though so long absent from Paris . I will now explain why . Some months ago , one of my colleagues engaged in the political department ( which I am not ) was sent to Lyons , in consequence of some suspicions conceived by the loyal authorities there of a plot against the emperor ’s life . The suspicions were groundless , the plot a mare ’s nest . But my colleague ’s attention was especially drawn towards a man not mixed up with the circumstances from which a plot had been inferred , but deemed in some way or other a dangerous enemy to the Government . Ostensibly , he exercised a modest and small calling as a sort of courtier or agent de change ; but it was noticed that certain persons familiarly frequenting his apartment , or to whose houses he used to go at night , were disaffected to the Government,—not by any means of the lowest rank,—some of them rich malcontents who had been devoted Orleanists ; others , disappointed aspirants to office or the ‘ cross ; ’ one or two well - born and opulent fanatics dreaming of another Republic . Certain very able articles in the journals of the excitable Midi , though bearing another signature , were composed or dictated by this man,—articles evading the censure and penalties of the law , but very mischievous in their tone . All who had come into familiar communication with this person were impressed with a sense of his powers ; and also with a vague belief that he belonged to a higher class in breeding and education than that of a petty agent de change . My colleague set himself to watch the man , and took occasions of business at his little office to enter into talk with him . Not by personal appearance , but by voice , he came to a conclusion that the man was not wholly a stranger to him,—a peculiar voice with a slight Norman breadth of pronunciation , though a Parisian accent ; a voice very low , yet very distinct ; very masculine , yet very gentle . My colleague was puzzled till late one evening he observed the man coming out of the house of one of these rich malcontents , the rich malcontent himself accompanying him . My colleague , availing himself of the dimness of light , as the two passed into a lane which led to the agent ’s apartment , contrived to keep close behind and listen to their conversation ; but of this he heard nothing,—only , when at the end of the lane , the rich man turned abruptly , shook his companion warmly by the hand , and parted from him , saying , ‘ Never fear ; all shall go right with you , my dear Victor . ’ At the sound of that name ‘ Victor , ’ my colleague ’s memories , before so confused , became instantaneously clear . Previous to entering our service , he had been in the horse business , a votary of the turf ; as such he had often seen the brilliant ‘ sportman , ’ Victor de Mauleon ; sometimes talked to him . Yes , that was the voice,—the slight Norman intonation ( Victor de Mauleon ’s father had it strongly , and Victor had passed some of his early childhood in Normandy ) , the subdued modulation of speech which had made so polite the offence to men , or so winning the courtship to women,—that was Victor de Mauleon . But why there in that disguise ? What was his real business and object ? My confrere had no time allowed to him to prosecute such inquiries . Whether Victor or the rich malcontent had observed him at their heels , and feared he might have overheard their words , I know not ; but the next day appeared in one of the popular journals circulating among the ouvriers a paragraph stating that a Paris spy had been seen at Lyons , warning all honest men against his machinations , and containing a tolerably accurate description of his person . And that very day , on venturing forth , my estimable colleague suddenly found himself hustled by a ferocious throng , from whose hands he was with great difficulty rescued by the municipal guard . He left Lyons that night ; and for recompense of his services received a sharp reprimand from his chief . He had committed the worst offence in our profession , trop de zele . Having only heard the outlines of this story from another , I repaired to my confrere after my last interview with Monsieur , and learned what I now tell you from his own lips . As he was not in my branch of the service , I could not order him to return to Lyons ; and I doubt whether his chief would have allowed it . But I went to Lyons myself , and there ascertained that our supposed Vicomte had left that town for Paris some months ago , not long after the adventure of my colleague . The man bore a very good character generally,—was said to be very honest and inoffensive ; and the notice taken of him by persons of higher rank was attributed generally to a respect for his talents , and not on account of any sympathy in political opinions . I found that the confrere mentioned , and who alone could identify M. de Mauleon in the disguise which the Vicomte had assumed , was absent on one of those missions abroad in which he is chiefly employed . I had to wait for his return , and it was only the day before yesterday that I obtained the following particulars . M. de Mauleon bears the same name as he did at Lyons,—that name is Jean Lebeau ; he exercises the ostensible profession of a ‘ letter - writer , ’ and a sort of adviser on business among the workmen and petty bourgeoisie , and he nightly frequents the cafe Jean Jacques , Rue Faubourg Montmartre . It is not yet quite half - past eight , and , no doubt , you could see him at the cafe this very night , if you thought proper to go . ”
85845	85855	86375	86376	M. Renard	470	“ Excellent ! I will go ! Describe him ! ”
85856	85971	84663	84663	he	536	“ Alas ! that is exactly what I can not do at present ; for after hearing what I now tell you , I put the same request you do to my colleague , when , before he could answer me , he was summoned to the bureau of his chief , promising to return and give me the requisite description . He did not return ; and I find that he was compelled , on quitting his chief , to seize the first train starting for Lille upon an important political investigation which brooked no delay . He will be back in a few days , and then Monsieur shall have the description . ”
85972	86054	84663	84663	he	536	“ Nay ; I think I will seize time by the forelock , and try my chance tonight . If the man be really a conspirator , and it looks likely enough , who knows but what he may see quick reason to take alarm and vanish from Paris at any hour?—Cafe Jean Jacques , Rue — — — ; I will go . Stay ; you have seen Victor de Mauleon in his youth : what was he like then ? ”
86055	86109	86375	86376	M. Renard	470	“ Tall , slender , but broad - shouldered , very erect , carrying his head high , a profusion of dark curls , a small black mustache , fair clear complexion , light - coloured eyes with dark lashes , fort bel homme . But he will not look like that now . ”
86110	86115	84663	84663	he	536	“ His present age ? ”
86116	86238	84663	84663	he	536	“ Forty - seven or forty - eight . But before you go , I must beg you to consider well what you are about . It is evident that M. de Mauleon has some strong reason , whatever it be , for merging his identity in that of Jean Lebeau . I presume , therefore , that you could scarcely go up to M. Lebeau , when you have discovered him , and say , ‘ Pray , Monsieur le Vicomte , can you give me some tidings of your niece , Louise Duval ? ’ If you thus accosted him , you might possibly bring some danger on yourself , but you would certainly gain no information from him . ”
86239	86242	86375	86376	M. Renard	470	“ True . ”
86243	86270	84663	84663	he	536	“ On the other hand , if you make his acquaintance as M. Lebeau , how can you assume him to know anything about Louise Duval ? ”
86271	86363	84663	84663	he	536	“ Parbleu ! Monsieur Renard , you try to toss me aside on both horns of the dilemma ; but it seems to me that , if I once make his acquaintance as M. Lebeau , I might gradually and cautiously feel my way as to the best mode of putting the question to which I seek reply . I suppose , too , that the man must be in very poor circumstances to adopt so humble a calling , and that a small sum of money may smooth all difficulties . ”
86364	86373	86375	86376	M. Renard	470	“ I am not so sure of that , ”
86380	86566	86375	86376	M. Renard	470	“ but grant that money may do so , and grant also that the Vicomte , being a needy man , has become a very unscrupulous one,—is there anything in your motives for discovering Louise Duval which might occasion you trouble and annoyance , if it were divined by a needy and unscrupulous man ; anything which might give him a power of threat or exaction ? Mind , I am not asking you to tell me any secret you have reasons for concealing , but I suggest that it might be prudent if you did not let M. Lebeau know your real name and rank ; if , in short , you could follow his example , and adopt a disguise . But no ; when I think of it , you would doubtless be so unpractised in the art of disguise that he would detect you at once to be other than you seem ; and if suspecting you of spying into his secrets , and if those secrets be really of a political nature , your very life might not be safe . ”
86567	86807	86808	86808	Graham	536	“ Thank you for your hint ; the disguise is an excellent idea , and combines amusement with precaution . That this Victor de Mauleon must be a very unprincipled and dangerous man is , I think , abundantly clear . Granting that he was innocent of all design of robbery in the affair of the jewels , still , the offence which he did own — that of admitting himself at night by a false key into the rooms of a wife , whom he sought to surprise or terrify into dishonour — was a villanous action ; and his present course of life is sufficiently mysterious to warrant the most unfavourable supposition . Besides , there is another motive for concealing my name from him : you say that he once had a duel with a Vane , who was very probably my father , and I have no wish to expose myself to the chance of his turning up in London some day , and seeking to renew there the acquaintance that I had courted at Paris . As for my skill in playing any part I may assume , do not fear ; I am no novice in that . In my younger days I was thought clever in private theatricals , especially in the transformations of appearance which belong to light comedy and farce . Wait a few minutes , and you shall see . ”
86872	86876	86835	86835	He	536	“ to the manner born”—for
87001	87003	87031	87031	he	536	“ swell ”
87022	87030	87031	87031	he	536	“ Will it do , old fellow ? ”
87051	87054	87056	87056	Renard	470	“ Perfectly , ”
87060	87095	87056	87056	Renard	470	“ I offer my compliments , and if ever you are ruined , Monsieur , I will promise you a place in our police . Only one caution,—take care not to overdo your part . ”
87096	87108	87031	87031	he	536	“ Right . A quarter to nine ; I ’m off . ”
87489	87497	87485	87485	Graham	536	“ The bearded man is my Vicomte . ”
87571	87584	87566	87566	He	536	“ No man who can make a cannon there should accept odds . ”
87668	87671	87673	87674	the enthusiast	3285	“ Monsieur , ”
87686	87756	87673	87674	the enthusiast	3285	“ it is an amateur , who has been a great player in his day , and is so proud that he always takes less odds than he ought of a younger man . It is not once in a month that he comes out as he has done to - night ; but to - night he has steadied his hand . He has had six petits verres . ”
87757	87768	87673	87674	the enthusiast	3285	“ Ah , indeed ! Do you know his name ? ”
87769	87788	87673	87674	the enthusiast	3285	“ I should think so : he buried my father , my two aunts , and my wife . ”
87789	87792	87794	87794	Graham	536	“ Buried ? ”
87804	87810	87794	87794	Graham	536	“ I do n’t understand . ”
87811	87818	87673	87674	the enthusiast	3285	“ Monsieur , you are English . ”
87819	87824	87673	87674	the enthusiast	3285	“ I confess it . ”
87825	87834	87673	87674	the enthusiast	3285	“ And a stranger to the Faubourg Montmartre . ”
87835	87838	87673	87674	the enthusiast	3285	“ True . ”
87839	87868	87673	87674	the enthusiast	3285	“ Or you would have heard of M. Giraud , the liveliest member of the State Company for conducting funerals . They are going to play La Poule . ”
88021	88024	88026	88026	he	536	“ Probably , ”
88028	88057	88026	88026	he	536	“ I am too late , or perhaps he will not be here this evening . At all events , I will wait a quarter of an hour . ”
88113	88116	88099	88104	A monsieur at the round table	3301	“ Galignani , ”
88132	88141	88099	88104	A monsieur at the round table	3301	“ The English journal , at your service . ”
88149	88152	88099	88104	A monsieur at the round table	3301	“ Galignani , ”
88346	88349	88350	88350	he	536	“ Galignani , ”
88365	88416	88360	88361	His neighbour	3313	“ Merci ! I never smoke , never ; mon medecin forbids it . If I could be tempted , it would be by , an English cigar . Ah , how you English beat us in all things,—your ships , your iron , your tabac,—which you do not grow ! ”
88471	88481	88466	88466	he	536	“ How instinctive to all Frenchmen good breeding is ! ”
88538	88565	88528	88528	his	3319	“ I ’m afraid I ’m late , but there is still a good half - hour before us if you will give me my revenge . ”
88566	88577	88528	88528	his	3319	“ Willingly , Monsieur Georges . Garcon , the dominos . ”
88578	88586	88588	88589	M. Georges	640	“ Have you been playing at billiards ? ”
88591	88597	88588	88589	M. Georges	640	“ Yes , two games . ”
88598	88602	88528	88528	his	3319	“ With success ? ”
88603	88637	88588	88589	M. Georges	640	“ I won the first , and lost the second through the defect of my eyesight ; the game depended on a stroke which would have been easy to an infant,—I missed it . ”
88664	88683	88650	88651	the other	3321	“ A little , but not enough to comprehend why it is said to require so much skill . ”
88684	88713	88588	88589	M. Georges	640	“ It is chiefly an affair of memory with me ; but M. Georges , my opponent , has the talent of combination , which I have not . ”
88714	88717	88719	88720	M. Georges	640	“ Nevertheless , ”
88724	88742	88719	88720	M. Georges	640	“ you are not easily beaten ; it is for you to play first , Monsieur Lebeau . ”
89173	89197	89169	89170	M. Georges	640	“ By the way , Monsieur Lebeau , you promised to find me a locataire for my second floor ; have you succeeded ? ”
89198	89229	89151	89152	M. Georges	640	“ Not yet . Perhaps you had better advertise in ‘ Les Petites Affiches . ’ You ask too much for the habitues of this neighbourhood,—one hundred francs a month . ”
89230	89253	89169	89170	M. Georges	640	“ But the lodging is furnished , and well too , and has four rooms . One hundred francs are not much . ”
89260	89265	89266	89266	he	536	“ Pardon , Monsieur , ”
89269	89280	89266	89266	he	536	“ have you an appartement de garcon to let furnished ? ”
89281	89298	89151	89152	M. Georges	640	“ Yes , Monsieur , a charming one . Are you in search of an apartment ? ”
89299	89359	89151	89152	M. Georges	640	“ I have some idea of taking one , but only by the month . I am but just arrived at Paris , and I have business which may keep me here a few weeks . I do but require a bedroom and a small cabinet , and the rent must be modest . I am not a milord . ”
89360	89370	89372	89373	M. Georges	640	“ I am sure we could arrange , Monsieur , ”
89375	89395	89372	89373	M. Georges	640	“ though I could not well divide my logement . But one hundred francs a month is not much ! ”
89396	89447	89151	89152	M. Georges	640	“ I fear it is more than I can afford ; however , if you will give me your address , I will call and see the rooms,—say the day after to - morrow . Between this and then , I expect letters which may more clearly decide my movements . ”
89448	89455	89457	89458	M. Lebeau	634	“ If the apartments suit you , ”
89460	89528	89457	89458	M. Lebeau	634	“ you will at least be in the house of a very honest man , which is more than can be said of every one who lets furnished apartments . The house , too , has a concierge , with a handy wife who will arrange your rooms and provide you with coffee — or tea , which you English prefer — if you breakfast at home . ”
89546	89556	89558	89558	Graham	536	“ About twelve , if that hour is convenient , ”
89562	89578	89558	89558	Graham	536	“ I presume there is a restaurant in the neighbourhood where I could dine reasonably . ”
89579	89657	89457	89458	M. Lebeau	634	“ Je crois bien , half - a - dozen . I can recommend to you one where you can dine en prince for thirty sous . And if you are at Paris on business , and want any letters written in private , I can also recommend to you my friend here , M. Lebeau . Ay , and on affairs his advice is as good as a lawyer ’s , and his fee a bagatelle . ”
89658	89672	89675	89676	M. Lebeau	634	“ Do n’t believe all that Monsieur Georges so flatteringly says of me , ”
89689	89792	89457	89458	M. Lebeau	634	“ I should tell you that I , like yourself , am recently arrived at Paris , having bought the business and goodwill of my predecessor in the apartment I occupy ; and it is only to the respect due to his antecedents , and on the score of a few letters of recommendation which I bring from Lyons , that I can attribute the confidence shown to me , a stranger in this neighbourhood . Still I have some knowledge of the world , and I am always glad if I can be of service to the English . I love the English”—he
89812	89828	89457	89458	M. Lebeau	634	tone,—“I have met with much kindness from them in the course of a chequered life . ”
89829	89845	89847	89847	Graham	536	“ You seem a very good fellow,—in fact , a regular trump , Monsieur Lebeau , ”
89854	89915	89847	89847	Graham	536	“ Give me your address . To say truth , I am a very poor French scholar , as you must have seen , and am awfully bother - headed how to manage some correspondence on matters with which I am entrusted by my employer , so that it is a lucky chance which has brought me acquainted with you . ”
89996	90003	90005	90005	he	536	“ In conformity with your advice , ”
90007	90102	90005	90005	he	536	“ not to expose myself to the chance of future annoyance , by confiding to a man so dangerous as the false Lebeau my name and address , I propose to take the lodging offered to me , as Mr. Lamb , an attorney ’s clerk , commissioned to get in certain debts , and transact other matters of business , on behalf of his employer ’s clients . I suppose there will be no difficulty with the police in this change of name , now that passports for the English are not necessary ? ”
90103	90116	90379	90380	M. Renard	470	“ Certainly not . You will have no trouble in that respect . ”
90117	90270	90379	90380	M. Renard	470	“ I shall thus be enabled very naturally to improve acquaintance with the professional letter - writer , and find an easy opportunity to introduce the name of Louise Duval . My chief difficulty , I fear , not being a practical actor , will be to keep up consistently the queer sort of language I have adopted , both in French and in English . I have too sharp a critic in a man so consummate himself in stage trick and disguise as M. Lebeau not to feel the necessity of getting through my role as quickly as I can . Meanwhile , can you recommend me to some magasin where I can obtain a suitable change of costume ? I ca n’t always wear a travelling suit , and I must buy linen of coarser texture than mine , and with the initials of my new name inscribed on it . ”
90271	90298	90379	90380	M. Renard	470	“ Quite right to study such details ; I will introduce you to a magasin near the Temple , where you will find all you want . ”
90299	90338	90379	90380	M. Renard	470	“ Next , have you any friends or relations in the provinces unknown to M. Lebeau , to whom I might be supposed to write about debts or business matters , and from whom I might have replies ? ”
90339	90370	90379	90380	M. Renard	470	“ I will think over it , and manage that for you very easily . Your letters shall find their way to me , and I will dictate the answers . ”
90885	90887	90925	90926	M. Lebeau	634	“ swell ”
90889	90891	90925	90926	M. Lebeau	634	“ stunner ”
90893	90897	90925	90926	M. Lebeau	634	“ awfully jolly , ”
91322	91336	91319	91320	Eugene Dupont	649	“ Nous ne voulons plus de religion , car les religions etouffent l’intelligence . ”
91821	91832	91816	91816	he	378	“ A queer fellow that you have just nodded to . “
91836	91837	91816	91816	he	378	” “
91845	91846	91840	91840	he	9188	” “
91859	91860	91861	91861	I	0	” “
91905	91906	91898	91898	their	3421	” “
91925	91926	91908	91908	I	0	” “
91932	91933	91967	91967	you	0	” “
91937	91938	91967	91967	you	0	” “
91947	91963	91967	91967	you	0	” Lebeau turned his green spectacles full on Graham ’s face as he said slowly , “
91972	91988	91967	91967	you	0	” Graham prudently checked the disparaging reply that first occurred to him , and said , “
92002	92003	92000	92000	you	3426	” “
92040	92041	92035	92035	you	3426	” “
92066	92067	92068	92068	You	3426	” “
92092	92093	92094	92094	I	0	” “
92107	92108	92099	92099	I	0	” “
92118	92119	92120	92120	Willingly	652	” “
92133	92134	92124	92124	Georges	640	” “
92146	92414	92142	92142	you	3426	” Here M. Georges arrived , and no further conversation on political or social questions ensued . Graham had already called more than once at M. Lebeau ’s office , and asked him to put into good French various letters on matters of business , the subjects of which had been furnished by M. Renard . The office was rather imposing and stately , considering the modest nature of M. Lebeau ’s ostensible profession . It occupied the entire ground - floor of a corner house , with a front - door at one angle and a back - door at the other . The anteroom to his cabinet , and in which Graham had generally to wait some minutes before he was introduced , was generally well filled , and not only by persons who , by their dress and outward appearance , might be fairly supposed sufficiently illiterate to require his aid as polite letter - writers,—not only by servant - maids and grisettes , by sailors , zouaves , and journeymen workmen,—but not unfrequently by clients evidently belonging to a higher , or at least a richer , class of society,—men with clothes made by a fashionable tailor ; men , again , who , less fashionably attired ; looked like opulent tradesmen and fathers of well - to - do families,—the first generally young , the last generally middle - aged . All these denizens of a higher world were introduced by a saturnine clerk into M. Lebeau ’s reception - room , very quickly and in precedence of the ouvriers and grisettes . “
92420	92424	92142	92142	you	3426	” thought Graham ; “
92444	92490	92491	92491	You	3434	” And so pondering , the clerk one day singled him from the crowd and admitted him into M. Lebeau ’s cabinet . Graham thought the time had now arrived when he might safely approach the subject that had brought him to the Faubourg Montmartre . “
92496	92511	92491	92491	You	3434	” said Graham , speaking in the English of a young earl in our elegant novels,—“you
92566	92567	92543	92543	you	3434	” “
92571	92578	92543	92543	you	3434	” answered M. Lebeau in French , “
92730	92731	92720	92720	I	0	” “
92734	92744	92720	92720	I	0	” said Graham , assuming a very earnest look , “
92766	92767	92756	92756	you	3434	” “
92773	92774	92756	92756	you	3434	” “
92821	92822	92816	92818	your famous police	3447	” “
92825	92826	92827	92827	I	0	” “
92860	92861	92862	92862	I	0	” “
92883	92884	92885	92885	I	0	” “
92920	93018	92896	92897	Louise Duval	385	” Graham , while he thus said , naturally looked Lebeau in the face,—not pryingly , not significantly , but as a man generally does look in the face the other man whom he accosts seriously . The change in the face he regarded was slight , but it was unmistakable . It was the sudden meeting of the eyebrows , accompanied with the sudden jerk of the shoulder and bend of the neck , which betoken a man taken by surprise , and who pauses to reflect before he replies . His pause was but momentary , “
93027	93028	93030	93030	I	0	” “
93167	93168	93169	93169	Hem	353	” “
93189	93190	93172	93172	you	353	” “
93244	93245	93235	93235	I	0	” “
93300	93301	93307	93307	you	353	” “
93323	93467	93488	93489	Louise Duval	385	” Punctually at eight o’clock Graham Vane had taken his seat at a corner table at the remote end of the cafe Jean Jacques , called for his cup of coffee and his evening journal , and awaited the arrival of M. Lebeau . His patience was not tasked long . In a few minutes the Frenchman entered , paused at the comptoir , as was his habit , to address a polite salutation to the well - dressed lady who there presided , nodded as usual to Armand Monnier , then glanced round , recognized Graham with a smile , and approached his table with the quiet grace of movement by which he was distinguished . Seating himself opposite to Graham , and speaking in a voice too low to be heard by others , and in French , he then said , “
93526	93527	93518	93518	you	3471	” “
93534	93538	93528	93528	You	3471	” answered Graham . “
93675	93676	93678	93678	you	0	” “
93685	93686	93678	93678	you	0	” “
93742	93743	93730	93730	I	0	” “
93766	93767	93775	93776	Louise Duval	385	” “
93778	93779	93775	93776	Louise Duval	385	” “
93800	93801	93786	93786	you	0	” “
93804	93808	93814	93814	you	0	” said Graham ; “
93926	93939	93924	93925	old boy	3489	” ( with a familiar slap on Lebeau ’s stately shoulder ) , “
93977	94013	93976	93976	I.	0	” M. Lebeau mechanically brushed , with a light movement of hand , the shoulder which the Englishman had so pleasantly touched , drew himself and chair some inches back , and said slowly , — “
94127	94128	94130	94130	he	1106	” “
94138	94142	94130	94130	he	1106	” thought Graham . “
94148	94153	94130	94130	he	1106	” he said aloud ; “
94184	94185	94186	94186	I	0	” “
94244	94245	94215	94215	he	1514	” “
94253	94254	94215	94215	he	1514	” “
94287	94288	94299	94299	you	654	” “
94292	94296	94299	94299	you	654	” cried Graham , “
94315	94316	94299	94299	you	654	” “
94359	94360	94352	94352	I	0	” “
94364	94365	94366	94366	I	0	” “
94378	94379	94366	94366	I	0	” “
94403	94455	94391	94391	I	0	” Late that night M. Lebeau was seated alone in a chamber connected with the cabinet in which he received visitors . A ledger was open before him , which he scanned with careful eyes , no longer screened by spectacles . The survey seemed to satisfy him . He murmured , “
94464	94509	94391	94391	I	0	” closed the book , returned it to his bureau , which he locked up , and then wrote in cipher the letter here reduced into English : — The next day at noon M. Louvier was closeted in his study with M. Gandrin . “
94512	94516	94517	94517	I	0	” cried Louvier , “
94535	94536	94527	94528	No one	9103	” “
94539	94543	94527	94528	No one	9103	” answered Gandrin . “
94571	94572	94527	94528	No one	9103	” “
94640	94641	94631	94634	the one thousand louis	3510	” “
94645	94646	94631	94634	the one thousand louis	3510	” “
94703	94729	94681	94682	sole mortgagee	1830	” Here a clerk entered and said that a monsieur wished to see M. Louvier for a few minutes in private , on urgent business . “
94738	94739	94681	94682	sole mortgagee	1830	” “
94759	94760	94750	94750	he	3506	” “
94775	94776	94781	94781	him	3506	” “
94796	94797	94787	94787	he	3506	” “
94823	94843	94821	94821	Bonjour	3517	” Louvier bowed out M. Gandrin , and then rubbed his hands complacently . He was in high spirits . “
94864	95228	94860	94861	thy father	3520	” he muttered chucklingly , and then took his stand on the hearth , with his back to the fireless grate . There entered a gentleman exceedingly well dressed,—dressed according to the fashion , but still as became one of ripe middle age , not desiring to pass for younger than he was . He was tall , with a kind of lofty ease in his air and his movements ; not slight of frame , but spare enough to disguise the strength and endurance which belong to sinews and thews of steel , freed from all superfluous flesh , broad across the shoulders , thin in the flanks . His dark hair had in youth been luxuriant in thickness and curl ; it was now clipped short , and had become bare at the temples , but it still retained the lustre of its colour and the crispness of its ringlets . He wore neither beard nor mustache , and the darkness of his hair was contrasted by a clear fairness of complexion , healthful , though somewhat pale , and eyes of that rare gray tint which has in it no shade of blue,—peculiar eyes , which give a very distinct character to the face . The man must have been singularly handsome in youth ; he was handsome still , though probably in his forty - seventh or forty - eighth year , doubtless a very different kind of comeliness . The form of the features and the contour of the face were those that suit the rounded beauty of the Greek outline , and such beauty would naturally have been the attribute of the countenance in earlier days ; but the cheeks were now thin , and with lines of care and sorrow between nostril and lip , so that the shape of the face seemed lengthened , and the features had become more salient . Louvier gazed at his visitor with a vague idea that he had seen him before , and could not remember where or when ; but at all events he recognized at the first glance a man of rank and of the great world . “
95235	95301	95233	95233	Monsieur	1758	” he said , resuming his own easy - chair . The visitor obeyed the invitation with a very graceful bend of his head , drew his chair near to the financier ’s , stretched his limbs with the ease of a man making himself at home , and fixing his calm bright eyes quietly on Louvier , said , with a bland smile , — “
95321	95343	95313	95313	You	3522	” Louvier stared hard and long ; his lip fell , his cheek paled , and at last he faltered out , “
95357	95358	95350	95350	Victor	578	” “
95367	95389	95365	95365	Louvier	399	” There was a pause ; the financier was evidently confused and embarrassed , and not less evidently the visit of the “
95393	95397	95398	95398	Vicomte	522	” was unwelcome . “
95400	95406	95398	95398	Vicomte	522	” he said at last , “
95424	95425	95413	95413	I	0	” “
95527	95528	95530	95530	you	3522	” “

95575	95589	95572	95572	you	3522	” Louvier stopped short ; something in the Vicomte ’s eye daunted him . “
95633	95634	95621	95621	you	3522	” “
95638	95639	95621	95621	you	3522	” “
95731	95777	95778	95778	Monsieur	1758	” The magnificent millionaire , accustomed to the homage of grandees from the Faubourg and lions from the Chaussee d’Antin , rose to his feet in superb wrath , less at the taunting words than at the haughtiness of mien with which they were uttered . “
95799	95800	95793	95793	you	1758	” “
95818	95825	95815	95815	I	0	” Louvier dropped into his chair . “
95828	95835	95815	95815	I	0	” resumed the Vicomte , politely , “
95873	95874	95875	95876	Louise Duval	385	” “
95884	95885	95878	95878	I	0	” “

96063	96064	96058	96066	the miserable Englishman who — ” “ No Englishman	3540	” “
96068	96074	96058	96066	the miserable Englishman who — ” “ No Englishman	3540	” interrupted Louvier , fiercely . “
96151	96152	96140	96140	you	522	” “
96200	96201	96196	96196	Louise	385	” “
96210	96211	96212	96212	I	0	” “

96287	96288	96289	96289	He	3542	” “
96304	96305	96297	96297	she	385	” “
96360	96361	96353	96353	us	3546	” “
96366	96371	96353	96353	us	3546	” muttered De Mauleon , “
96449	96543	96441	96441	I	0	” These words were said with a certain pathetic tenderness ; they softened Louvier towards the speaker . After a short pause the Vicomte swept his hand over his brow , as if to dismiss from his mind a painful and obtrusive thought ; then with a changed expression of countenance,—an expression frank and winning,—with voice and with manner in which no vestige remained of the irony or the haughtiness with which he had resented the frigidity of his reception , he drew his chair still nearer to Louvier ’s , and resumed : “
96631	96642	96643	96643	I	0	” Louvier coloured and muttered inaudibly . De Mauleon continued : “
96683	96692	96658	96658	you	658	” Louvier bowed his head , evidently gratified . “
96778	96796	96769	96769	I	0	” Louvier made a movement as if to extend his hand , but he checked the impulse . “
96943	96944	96989	96989	you	658	” “
97026	97027	97029	97029	I	0	” “
97143	97144	97133	97133	You	658	” “
97147	97153	97133	97133	You	658	” said Louvier , falteringly , “
97172	97173	97174	97174	I	0	” “
97200	97201	97181	97181	I	0	” “
97209	97210	97181	97181	I	0	” “
97221	97229	97216	97216	you	1663	” cried De Mauleon , with heat ; “
97255	97256	97216	97216	you	1663	” “
97260	97266	97216	97216	you	1663	” answered Louvier , meekly , “
97377	97424	97355	97356	your friend	1623	” The Vicomte made a perceptible effort to repress an impulse of rage ; then reseating himself in his chair , and with that slight shrug of the shoulder by which a Frenchman implies to himself that rage would be out of place , replied calmly , “
97731	97810	97721	97721	I	0	” Despite the repetition of the displeasing patrician motto , such reminiscences of his visitor ’s motley character — irregular , turbulent , the reverse of severe , but , in its own loose way , grandly generous and grandly brave — struck both on the common - sense and the heart of the listener ; and the Frenchman recognized the Frenchman . Louvier doubted De Mauleon ’s word no more , bowed his head , and said , “
97823	97824	97815	97815	I	0	” “
98284	98285	98282	98282	Louvier	658	” “
98297	98298	98278	98278	You	3608	” “
98462	98477	98449	98449	herself	3617	” Again De Mauleon paused in suppressed emotion , and then went on hurriedly : “
98578	98579	98582	98582	I	0	” “
98626	98627	98613	98613	you	3624	” “
98695	98739	98684	98685	her maid	3630	“ But to proceed . In the flush of my high spirits , and in the insolence of magnificent ease with which I paid De N — — — the trifle I owed him , something he said made my heart stand still . ”
98740	98972	98684	98685	her maid	3630	“ I told him that the money received had come from Jacques de Mauleon , and that I was going down to his house that day to thank him . He replied , ‘ Do n’t go ; it did not come from him . ’ ‘ It must ; see the post - mark of the envelope,—Fontainebleau . ’ ‘ I posted it at Fontainebleau . ’ ‘ You sent me the money , you ! ’ ‘ Nay , that is beyond my means . Where it came from , ’ said this miserable , ‘ much more may yet come ; ’ and then be narrated , with that cynicism so in vogue at Paris , how he had told the Duchesse ( who knew him as my intimate associate ) of my stress of circumstance , of his fear that I meditated something desperate ; how she gave him the jewels to sell and to substitute ; how , in order to baffle my suspicion and frustrate my scruples , he had gone to Fontainebleau and there posted the envelope containing the bank - notes , out of which he secured for himself the payment he deemed otherwise imperilled . De N. having made this confession , hurried down the stairs swiftly enough to save himself a descent by the window . Do you believe me still ? ”
98973	98997	98684	98685	her maid	3630	“ Yes ; you were always so hot - blooded , and De N. so considerate of self , I believe you implicitly . ”
98998	99111	98684	98685	her maid	3630	“ Of course I did what any man would do ; I wrote a hasty letter to the Duchesse , stating all my gratitude for an act of pure friendship so noble ; urging also the reasons that rendered it impossible for a man of honour to profit by such an act . Unhappily , what had been sent was paid away ere I knew the facts ; but I could not bear the thought of life till my debt to her was acquitted ; in short , Louvier , conceive for yourself the sort of letter which I — which any honest man — would write , under circumstances so cruel . ”
99112	99115	99117	99117	Louvier	658	“ H’m ! ”
99119	99495	99117	99117	Louvier	658	“ Something , however , in my letter , conjoined with what De N. had told her as to my state of mind , alarmed this poor woman , who had deigned to take in me an interest so little deserved . Her reply , very agitated and incoherent , was brought to me by her maid , who had taken my letter , and by whom , as I before said , our correspondence had been of late carried on . In her reply she implored me to decide , to reflect on nothing till I had seen her ; stated how the rest of her day was pre - engaged ; and since to visit her openly had been made impossible by the Due ’s interdict , enclosed the key to the private entrance to her rooms , by which I could gain an interview with her at ten o’clock that night , an hour at which the Duc had informed her he should be out till late at his club . Now , however great the indiscretion which the Duchesse here committed , it is due to her memory to say that I am convinced that her dominant idea was that I meditated self - destruction ; that no time was to be lost to save me from it ; and for the rest she trusted to the influence which a woman ’s tears and adjurations and reasonings have over even the strongest and hardest men . It is only one of those coxcombs in whom the world of fashion abounds who could have admitted a thought that would have done wrong to the impulsive , generous , imprudent eagerness of a woman to be in time to save from death by his own hand a fellow - being for whom she had conceived an interest . I so construed her note . At the hour she named I admitted myself into the rooms by the key she sent . You know the rest : I was discovered by the Duc and by the agents of police in the cabinet in which the Duchesse ’s jewels were kept . The key that admitted me into the cabinet was found in my possession . ”
99534	99742	99518	99518	he	597	“ Ah ! you envied me , did you , for being spoiled by the women ? Enviable position indeed was mine that night ! The Duc obeyed the first impulse of his wrath . He imagined that I had dishonoured him ; he would dishonour me in return . Easier to his pride , too , a charge against the robber of jewels than against a favoured lover of his wife . But when I , obeying the first necessary obligation of honour , invented on the spur of the moment the story by which the Duchesse ’s reputation was cleared from suspicion , accused myself of a frantic passion and the trickery of a fabricated key , the Due ’s true nature of gentilhomme came back . He retracted the charge which he could scarcely even at the first blush have felt to be well - founded ; and as the sole charge left was simply that which men comme il faut do not refer to criminal courts and police investigations , I was left to make my bow unmolested and retreat to my own rooms , awaiting there such communciations as the Duc might deem it right to convey to me on the morrow . “
99925	99926	99928	99928	you	0	” “
99955	99956	99928	99928	you	0	” “

100003	100008	100009	100010	The Duc	368	” grunted Louvier again . “
100153	100154	100155	100155	You	3648	” “
100161	100167	100155	100155	You	3648	” asked Louvier , quickly . “
100184	100325	100333	100333	he	522	“ I need not say that I replied stating the time at which I should arrive at Bayonne , and the hotel at which I should await the Duc ’s command . Accordingly I set out that same day , gained the hotel named , despatched to the Duc the announcement of my arrival , and was considering how I should obtain a second in some officer quartered in the town — for my soreness and resentment at the marked coldness of my former acquaintances at Paris had forbidden me to seek a second among any of that faithless number — when the Due himself entered my room . Judge of my amaze at seeing him in person ; judge how much greater the amaze became when he advanced with a grave but cordial smile , offering me his hand ! “
100499	100547	100456	100456	her	668	“ The Due continued his journey the next day , but he subsequently honoured me with two or three letters written as friend to friend , and in which you will find repeated the substance of what I have stated him to say by word of mouth . ”
100548	100582	100450	100451	The Duchesse	2775	“ But why not then have returned to Paris ? Such letters , at least , you might have shown , and in braving your calumniators you would have soon lived them down . ”
100583	100784	100450	100451	The Duchesse	2775	“ You forget that I was a ruined man . When , by the sale of my horses , etc . , my debts , including what was owed to the Duchesse , and which I remitted to the Duc , were discharged , the balance left to me would not have maintained me a week at Paris . Besides , I felt so sore , so indignant . Paris and the Parisians had become to me so hateful . And to crown all , that girl , that English girl whom I had so loved , on whose fidelity I had so counted — well , I received a letter from her , gently but coldly bidding me farewell forever . I do not think she believed me guilty of theft ; but doubtless the offence I had confessed , in order to save the honour of the Duchesse , could but seem to her all sufficient ! Broken in spirit , bleeding at heart to the very core , still self - destruction was no longer to be thought of . I would not die till I could once more lift up my head as Victor de Mauleon . ”
100785	100796	100456	100456	her	668	“ What then became of you , my poor Victor ? ”
100797	101075	100450	100451	The Duchesse	2775	“ Ah ! that is a tale too long for recital . I have played so many parts that I am puzzled to recognize my own identity with the Victor de Mauleon whose name I abandoned . I have been a soldier in Algeria , and won my cross on the field of battle,—that cross and my colonel ’s letter are among my pieces justificatives ; I have been a gold - digger in California , a speculator in New York , of late in callings obscure and humble . But in all my adventures , under whatever name , I have earned testimonials of probity , could manifestations of so vulgar a virtue be held of account by the enlightened people of Paris . I come now to a close . The Vicomte de Mauleon is about to re - appear in Paris , and the first to whom he announces that sublime avatar is Paul Louvier . When settled in some modest apartment , I shall place in your hands my pieces justificatives . I shall ask you to summon my surviving relations or connections , among which are the Counts de Vandemar , Beauvilliers , De Passy , and the Marquis de Rochebriant , with any friends of your own who sway the opinions of the Great World . You will place my justification before them , expressing your own opinion that it suffices ; in a word , you will give me the sanction of your countenance . For the rest , I trust to myself to propitiate the kindly and to silence the calumnious . I have spoken ; what say you ? ”
101076	101095	100450	100451	The Duchesse	2775	“ You overrate my power in society . Why not appeal yourself to your high - born relations ? ”
101096	101192	100456	100456	her	668	“ No , Louvier ; I have too well considered the case to alter my decision . It is through you , and you alone , that I shall approach my relations . My vindicator must be a man of whom the vulgar can not say , ‘ Oh , he is a relation,—a fellow - noble ; those aristocrats whitewash each other . ’ It must be an authority with the public at large,—a bourgeois , a millionaire , a roi de la Bourse . I choose you , and that ends the discussion . ”
101235	101337	101231	101232	De Mauleon	597	“ Your task will be easy enough . Society changes rapidly at Paris . Few persons now exist who have more than a vague recollection of the circumstances which can be so easily explained to my complete vindication when the vindication comes from a man of your solid respectability and social influence . Besides , I have political objects in view . You are a Liberal ; the Vandemars and Rochebriants are Legitimists . I prefer a godfather on the Liberal side . Pardieu , mon ami , why such coquettish hesitation ? Said and done . Your hand on it . ”
101338	101355	101231	101232	De Mauleon	597	“ There is my hand then . I will do all I can to help you . ”
101356	101373	101231	101232	De Mauleon	597	“ I know you will , old friend ; and you do both kindly and wisely . ”
102199	102202	102204	102207	the Chevalier de Finisterre	655	“ Impossible , ”
102226	102266	102221	102221	He	8274	“ If I find in a few months that I am exceeding my means , I can but dispose of my rooms and my horses , and return to Rochebriant a richer man by far than I left it . ”
102613	102617	102653	102656	crowds of such philosophers	3724	“ the solemn plausibilities ”
102968	102973	102957	102957	Alain,—a	676	“ Almanach des Gourmands , ”
102989	103106	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ Pardieu ! my dear Alain . If Louvier has no sinister object in the generosity of his dealings with you , he will have raised himself prodigiously in my estimation . I shall forsake , in his favour , my allegiance to Duplessis , though that clever fellow has just made a wondrous coup in the Egyptians , and I gain forty thousand francs by having followed his advice . But if Duplessis has a head as long as Louvier ’s , he certainly has not an equal greatness of soul . Still , my dear friend , will you pardon me if I speak frankly , and in the way of a warning homily ? ”
103107	103117	102957	102957	Alain,—a	676	“ Speak ; you can not oblige me more . ”
103118	103172	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ Well , then , I know that you can no more live at Paris in the way you are doing , or mean to do , without some fresh addition to your income , than a lion could live in the Jardin des Plantes upon an allowance of two mice a week . ”
103173	103273	103274	103274	Frederic	363	“ I do n’t see that . Deducting what I pay to my aunt,—and I can not get her to take more than six thousand francs a year,—I have seven hundred napoleons left , net and clear . My rooms and stables are equipped , and I have twenty - five hundred francs in hand . On seven hundred napoleons a year , I calculate that I can very easily live as I do ; and if I fail — well , I must return to Pochebriant . Seven hundred napoleons a year will be a magnificent rental there . ”
103279	103324	103276	103276	his	363	“ You do not know how one expense leads to another . Above all , you do not calculate the chief part of one ’s expenditure,—the unforeseen . You will play at the Jockey Club , and lose half your income in a night . ”
103325	103333	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ I shall never touch a card . ”
103334	103384	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ So you say now , innocent as a lamb of the force of example . At all events , beau seigneur , I presume you are not going to resuscitate the part of the Ermite de la Chaussee d’Antin ; and the fair Parisiennes are demons of extravagance . ”
103385	103393	103276	103276	his	363	“ Demons whom I shall not court . ”
103394	103420	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ Did I say you would ? They will court you . Before another month has flown you will be inundated with billets - doux . ”
103421	103516	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ It is not a shower that will devastate my humble harvest . But , mon cher , we are falling upon very gloomy topics . Laissez - moi tranquille in my illusions , if illusions they be . Ah , you can not conceive what a new life opens to the man who , like myself , has passed the dawn of his youth in privation and fear , when he suddenly acquires competence and hope . If it lasts only a year , it will be something to say ‘ Vixi . ’ ”
103517	103520	103522	103522	Frederic	363	“ Alain , ”
103527	103614	103522	103522	Frederic	363	“ believe me , I should not have assumed the ungracious and inappropriate task of Mentor , if it were only a year ’s experience at stake , or if you were in the position of men like myself,—free from the encumbrance of a great name and heavily mortgaged lands . Should you fail to pay regularly the interest due to Louvier , he has the power to put up at public auction , and there to buy in for himself , your chateau and domain . ”
103615	103730	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ I am aware that in strict law he would have such power , though I doubt if he would use it . Louvier is certainly a much better and more generous fellow than I could have expected ; and if I believe De Finisterre , he has taken a sincere liking to me on account of affection to my poor father . But why should not the interest be paid regularly ? The revenues from Rochebriant are not likely to decrease , and the charge on them is lightened by the contract with Louvier . And I will confide to you a hope I entertain of a very large addition to my rental . ”
103731	103734	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ How ? ”
103735	103792	103522	103522	Frederic	363	“ A chief part of my rental is derived from forests , and De Finisterre has heard of a capitalist who is disposed to make a contract for their sale at the fall this year , and may probably extend it to future years , at a price far exceeding that which I have hitherto obtained . ”
103793	103812	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ Pray be cautious . De Finisterre is not a man I should implicitly trust in such matters . ”
103813	103871	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ Why ? Do you know anything against him ? He is in the best society,—perfect gentilhomme,—and , as his name may tell you , a fellow - Breton . You yourself allow , and so does Enguerrand , that the purchases he made for me — in this apartment , my horses , etc.—are singularly advantageous . ”
103872	103954	103522	103522	Frederic	363	“ Quite true ; the Chevalier is reputed sharp and clever , is said to be very amusing , and a first - rate piquet - player . I do n’t know him personally,—I am not in his set . I have no valid reason to disparage his character , nor do I conjecture any motive he could have to injure or mislead you . Still , I say , be cautious how far you trust to his advice or recommendation . ”
103955	103961	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ Again I ask why ? ”
103962	104092	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ He is unlucky to his friends . He attaches himself much to men younger than himself ; and somehow or other I have observed that most of them have come to grief . Besides , a person in whose sagacity I have great confidence warned me against making the Chevalier ’s acquaintance , and said to me , in his blunt way , ‘ De Finisterre came to Paris with nothing ; he has succeeded to nothing ; he belongs to no ostensible profession by which anything can be made . But evidently now he has picked up a good deal ; and in proportion as any young associate of his becomes poorer , De Finisterre seems mysteriously to become richer . Shun that sort of acquaintance . ’ ”
104093	104100	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ Who is your sagacious adviser ! ”
104101	104104	103522	103522	Frederic	363	“ Duplessis . ”
104105	104152	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ Ah , I thought so . That bird of prey fancies every other bird looking out for pigeons . I fancy that Duplessis is , like all those money - getters , a seeker after fashion , and De Finisterre has not returned his bow . ”
104153	104240	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ My dear Alain , I am to blame ; nothing is so irritating as a dispute about the worth of the men we like . I began it , now let it be dropped ; only make me one promise,—that if you should be in arrear , or if need presses , you will come at once to me . It was very well to be absurdly proud in an attic , but that pride will be out of place in your appartement au premier . ”
104241	104262	104264	104264	Alain	351	“ You are the best fellow in the world , Frederic , and I make you the promise you ask , ”
104279	104309	104264	104264	Alain	351	“ And now , mon cher , what day will you dine with me to meet Raoul and Enguerrand , and some others whom you would like to know ? ”
104310	104346	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ Thanks , and hearty ones , but we move now in different spheres , and I shall not trespass on yours . Je suis trop bourgeois to incur the ridicule of le bourgeois gentilhomme . ”
104347	104369	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ Frederic , how dare you speak thus ? My dear fellow , my friends shall honour you as I do . ”
104370	104464	104264	104264	Alain	351	“ But that will be on your account , not mine . No ; honestly that kind of society neither tempts nor suits me . I am a sort of king in my own walk ; and I prefer my Bohemian royalty to vassalage in higher regions . Say no more of it . It will flatter my vanity enough if you will now and then descend to my coteries , and allow me to parade a Rochebriant as my familiar crony , slap him on the shoulder , and call him Alain . ”
104465	104499	102981	102981	Frederic	352	“ Fie ! you who stopped me and the English aristocrat in the Champs Elysees , to humble us with your boast of having fascinated une grande dame,—I think you said a duchesse . ”
104500	104503	104505	104505	Lemercier	363	“ Oh , ”
104518	104596	104511	104511	his	363	“ women are different ; love levels all ranks . I do n’t blame Ruy Blas for accepting the love of a queen , but I do blame him for passing himself off as a noble,—a plagiarism , by the by , from an English play . I do not love the English enough to copy them . A propos , what has become of ce beau Grarm Varn ? I have not seen him of late . ”
104597	104601	104629	104629	Alain	351	“ Neither have I. ”
104602	104608	104615	104615	Alain	351	“ Nor the belle Italienne ? ”
104609	104613	104615	104615	Alain	351	“ Nor her , ”
104639	104658	104629	104629	Alain	351	“ Enguerrand , I present to you M. Lemercier , my earliest and one of my dearest friends . ”
104752	104762	104764	104764	Enguerrand	564	“ I know M. Lemercier by sight very well , ”
104769	104831	104764	104764	Enguerrand	564	“ One sees him very often in the Bois ; and I have met him in the Coulisses and the Bal Mabille . I think , too , that he plays at the Bourse , and is lie with M. Duplessis , who bids fair to rival Louvier one of these days . Is Duplessis also one of your dearest friends ? ”
104832	104850	104734	104734	He	352	“ No , indeed . I once met him , and was not prepossessed in his favour . ”
104851	104865	104734	104734	He	352	“ Nevertheless , he is a man much to be admired and respected . ”
104866	104870	104764	104764	Enguerrand	564	“ Why so ? ”
104871	104893	104764	104764	Enguerrand	564	“ Because he understands so well the art of making what we all covet,—money . I will introduce you to him . ”
104894	104901	104734	104734	He	352	“ I have been already introduced . ”
104902	104936	104764	104764	Enguerrand	564	“ Then I will re - introduce you . He is much courted in a society which I have recently been permitted by my father to frequent,—the society , of the Imperial Court . ”
104937	104949	104764	104764	Enguerrand	564	“ You frequent that society , and the Count permits it ? ”
104950	104982	104734	104734	He	352	“ Yes ; better the Imperialists than the Republicans ; and my father begins to own that truth , though he is too old or too indolent to act on it . ”
104983	104987	104764	104764	Enguerrand	564	“ And Raoul ? ”
104988	105489	104764	104764	Enguerrand	564	“ Oh , Raoul , the melancholy and philosophical Raoul , has no ambition of any kind , so long as — thanks somewhat to me — his purse is always replenished for the wants of his stately existence , among the foremost of which wants are the means to supply the wants of others . That is the true reason why he consents to our glove - shop . Raoul belongs , with some other young men of the Faubourg , to a society enrolled under the name of Saint Francois de Sales , for the relief of the poor . He visits their houses , and is at home by their sickbeds as at their stinted boards . Nor does he confine his visitations to the limits of our Faubourg ; he extends his travels to Montmartre and Belleville . As to our upper world , he does not concern himself much with its changes . He says that we have destroyed too much ever to rebuild solidly ; and that whatever we do build could be upset any day by a Paris mob , which he declares to be the only institution we have left . A wonderful fellow is Raoul,—full of mind , though he does little with it ; full of heart , which he devotes to suffering humanity , and to a poetic , knightly reverence ( not to be confounded with earthly love , and not to be degraded into that sickly sentiment called Platonic affection ) for the Comtesse di Rimini , who is six years older than himself , and who is very faithfully attached to her husband , Raoul ’s intimate friend , whose honour he would guard as his own . It is an episode in the drama of Parisian life , and one not so uncommon as the malignant may suppose . Di Rimini knows and approves of his veneration ; my mother , the best of women , sanctions it , and deems truly that it preserves Raoul safe from all the temptations to which ignobler youth is exposed . I mention this lest you should imagine there was anything in Raoul ’s worship of his star less pure than it is . For the rest , Raoul , to the grief and amazement of that disciple of Voltaire , my respected father , is one of the very few men I know in our circles who is sincerely religious,—an orthodox Catholic,—and the only man I know who practises the religion he professes ; charitable , chaste , benevolent ; and no bigot , no intolerant ascetic . His only weakness is his entire submission to the worldly common - sense of his good - for - nothing , covetous , ambitious brother Enguerrand . I can not say how I love him for that . If he had not such a weakness , his excellence would gall me , and I believe I should hate him . ”
105532	105535	105537	105537	Enguerrand	564	“ But , ”
105539	105589	105537	105537	Enguerrand	564	“ I have not come here to indulge in the overflow of brotherly affection . I come to take you to your relation , the Duchesse of Tarascon . I have pledged myself to her to bring you , and she is at home on purpose to receive you . ”
105590	105634	105537	105537	Enguerrand	564	“ In that case I can not be such a churl as to refuse . And , indeed , I no longer feel quite the same prejudices against her and the Imperialists as I brought from Bretagne . Shall I order my carriage ? ”
105635	105656	105537	105537	Enguerrand	564	“ No ; mine is at the door . Yours can meet you where you will , later . Allons . ”
106071	106073	106060	106060	She	2775	“ conserved ”
106258	106262	106263	106263	she	2775	“ Unnatural cousin ! ”
106277	106315	106263	106263	she	2775	smile,—“all this age in Paris , and I see you for the first time . But there is joy on earth as in heaven over sinners who truly repent . You repent truly — n’est ce pas ? ”
106343	106350	106352	106352	he	351	“ Ah , Madame la Duchesse , ”
106363	106395	106352	106352	he	351	“ it was not sin , unless modesty be a sin , which made a rustic hesitate long before he dared to offer his homage to the queen of the graces . ”
106396	106404	106406	106406	Enguerrand	564	“ Not badly said for a rustic , ”
106408	106413	106406	106406	Enguerrand	564	“ eh , Madame ? ”
106414	106422	106424	106425	the Duchesse	2775	“ My cousin , you are pardoned , ”
106427	106464	106465	106465	she	2775	“ Compliment is the perfume of gentilhommerie ; and if you brought enough of that perfume from the flowers of Rochebriant to distribute among the ladies at court , you will be terribly the mode there . Seducer!”—here
106496	106538	106465	106465	she	2775	“ Why , you are even handsomer than your father . I shall be proud to present to their Imperial Majesties so becoming a cousin . But seat yourselves here , Messieurs , close to my arm - chair , caussons . ”
106715	106720	106721	106721	she	2775	“ It is true , ”
106724	106985	106721	106721	she	2775	“ that the times grow menacing , menacing not only to the throne , but to order and property and France . One by one they are removing all the breakwaters which the empire had constructed between the executive and the most fickle and impulsive population that ever shouted ‘ long live ’ one day to the man whom they would send to the guillotine the next . They are denouncing what they call personal government . Grant that it has its evils ; but what would they substitute,—a constitutional monarchy like the English ? That is impossible with universal suffrage and without an hereditary chamber . The nearest approach to it was the monarchy of Louis Philippe,—we know how sick they became of that . A republic?—mon Dieu ! composed of Republicans terrified out of their wits at each other . The moderate men , mimics of the Girondins , with the Reds and the Socialists and the Communists , ready to tear them to pieces . And then — What then?—the commercialists , the agriculturists , the middle class combining to elect some dictator who will cannonade the mob and become a mimic Napoleon , grafted on a mimic Necker or a mimic Danton . Oh , Messieurs , I am French to the core . You inheritors of such names must be as French as I am ; and yet you men insist on remaining more useless to France in the midst of her need than I am,—I , a woman who can but talk and weep . ”
107012	107016	107018	107019	the latter	2455	“ Dear Madame , ”
107021	107114	107018	107019	the latter	2455	“ I do not see how either myself or our kinsman can merit your reproach . We are not legislators . I doubt if there is a single department in France that would elect us , if we offered ourselves . It is not our fault if the various floods of revolution leave men of our birth and opinions stranded wrecks of a perished world . The emperor chooses his own advisers , and if they are bad ones , his Majesty certainly will not ask Alain and me to replace them . ”
107115	107125	107127	107128	the Duchesse	2775	“ You do not answer — you evade me , ”
107135	107276	107127	107128	the Duchesse	2775	“ You are too skilled a man of the world , Monsieur Enguerrand , not to know that it is not only legislators and ministers that are necessary to the support of a throne , and the safeguard of a nation . Do you not see how great a help it is to both throne and nation when that section of public opinion which is represented by names illustrious in history , identified with records of chivalrous deeds and loyal devotion , rallies round the order established ? Let that section of public opinion stand aloof , soured and discontented , excluded from active life , lending no counter - balance to the perilous oscillations of democratic passion , and tell me if it is not an enemy to itself as well as a traitor to the principles it embodies ? ”
107277	107285	107287	107287	Alain	351	“ The principles it embodies , Madame , ”
107289	107518	107287	107287	Alain	351	“ are those of fidelity to a race of kings unjustly set aside , less for the vices than the virtues of ancestors . Louis XV . was the worst of the Bourbons,—he was the bien aime : he escapes . Louis XVI . was in moral attributes the best of the Bourbons,—he dies the death of a felon . Louis XVIII . , against whom much may be said , restored to the throne by foreign bayonets , reigning as a disciple of Voltaire might reign , secretly scoffing alike at the royalty and the religion which were crowned in his person , dies peacefully in his bed . Charles X. , redeeming the errors of his youth by a reign untarnished by a vice , by a religion earnest and sincere , is sent into exile for defending established order from the very inroads which you lament . He leaves an heir against whom calumny can not invent a tale , and that heir remains an outlaw simply because he descends from Henry IV . , and has a right to reign . Madame , you appeal to us as among the representatives of the chivalrous deeds and loyal devotion which characterized the old nobility of France . Should we deserve that character if we forsook the unfortunate , and gained wealth and honour in forsaking ? ”
107519	107535	107537	107538	the Duchesse	2775	“ Your words endear you to me . I am proud to call you cousin , ”
107540	108081	107537	107538	the Duchesse	2775	“ But do you , or does any man in his senses believe that if you upset the Empire you could get back the Bourbons ; that you would not be in imminent danger of a Government infinitely more opposed to the theories on which rests the creed of Legitimists than that of Louis Napoleon ? After all , what is there in the loyalty of you Bourbonites that has in it the solid worth of an argument which can appeal to the comprehension of mankind , except it be the principle of a hereditary monarchy ? Nobody nowadays can maintain the right divine of a single regal family to impose itself upon a nation . That dogma has ceased to be a living principle ; it is only a dead reminiscence . But the institution of monarchy is a principle strong and vital , and appealing to the practical interests of vast sections of society . Would you sacrifice the principle which concerns the welfare of millions , because you can not embody it in the person of an individual utterly insignificant in himself ? In a word , if you prefer monarchy to the hazard of republicanism for such a country as France , accept the monarchy you find , since it is quite clear you can not rebuild the monarchy you would prefer . Does it not embrace all the great objects for which you call yourself Legitimist ? Under it religion is honoured , a national Church secured , in reality if not in name ; under it you have united the votes of millions to the establishment of the throne ; under it all the material interests of the country , commercial , agricultural , have advanced with an unequalled rapidity of progress ; under it Paris has become the wonder of the world for riches , for splendour , for grace and beauty ; under it the old traditional enemies of France have been humbled and rendered impotent . The policy of Richelieu has been achieved in the abasement of Austria ; the policy of Napoleon I. has been consummated in the salvation of Europe from the semi - barbarous ambition of Russia . England no longer casts her trident in the opposition scale of the balance of European power . Satisfied with the honour of our alliance , she has lost every other ally ; and her forces neglected , her spirit enervated , her statesmen dreaming believers in the safety of their island , provided they withdraw from the affairs of Europe , may sometimes scold us , but will certainly not dare to fight . With France she is but an inferior satellite ; without France she is — nothing . Add to all this a court more brilliant than that of Louis XIV . , a sovereign not indeed without faults and errors , but singularly mild in his nature , warm - hearted to friends , forgiving to foes , whom personally no one could familiarly know and not be charmed with a bonte of character , lovable as that of Henri IV.,—and tell me what more than all this could you expect from the reign of a Bourbon ? ”
108082	108087	108089	108089	Alain	351	“ With such results , ”
108091	108134	108089	108089	Alain	351	“ from the monarchy you so eloquently praise , I fail to discover what the emperor ’s throne could possibly gain by a few powerless converts from an unpopular , and you say , no doubt truly , from a hopeless cause . ”
108135	108252	107537	107538	the Duchesse	2775	“ I say monarchy gains much by the loyal adhesion of any man of courage , ability , and honour . Every new monarchy gains much by conversions from the ranks by which the older monarchies were strengthened and adorned . But I do not here invoke your aid merely to this monarchy , my cousin ; I demand your devotion to the interests of France ; I demand that you should not rest an outlaw from her service . Ah , you think that France is in no danger , that you may desert or oppose the Empire as you list , and that society will remain safe ! You are mistaken . Ask Enguerrand . ”
108253	108256	108258	108258	Enguerrand	416	“ Madame , ”
108260	108436	108258	108258	Enguerrand	416	“ you overrate my political knowledge in that appeal ; but , honestly speaking , I subscribe to your reasonings . I agree with you that the empire sorely needs the support of men of honour ; it has one cause of rot which now undermines it,—dishonest jobbery in its administrative departments ; even in that of the army , which apparently is so heeded and cared for . I agree with you that France is in danger , and may need the swords of all her better sons , whether against the foreigner or against her worst enemies,—the mobs of her great towns . I myself received a military education , and but for my reluctance to separate myself from my father and Raoul , I should be a candidate for employments more congenial to me than those of the Bourse and my trade in the glove - shop . But Alain is happily free from all family ties , and Alain knows that my advice to him is not hostile to your exhortations . ”
108437	108451	108453	108454	the Duchesse	2775	“ I am glad to think he is under so salutary an influence , ”
108622	108638	108600	108600	himself	3796	“ You are waiting for your antagonist at dominos , M. Lebeau,—a very remarkable man . ”
108639	108663	108595	108596	the ouvrier	3796	“ So he seems . I know , however , but little of him . You , perhaps , have known him longer ? ”
108664	108689	108595	108596	the ouvrier	3796	“ Several months . Many of your countrymen frequent this cafe , but you do not seem to care to associate with the blouses . ”
108690	108791	108792	108793	Armand Monnier	650	“ It is not that ; but we islanders are shy , and do n’t make acquaintance with each other readily . By the way , since you so courteously accost me , I may take the liberty of saying that I overheard you defend the other night , against one of my countrymen , who seemed to me to talk great nonsense , the existence of le bon Dieu . You had much the best of it . I rather gathered from your argument that you went somewhat further , and were not too enlightened to admit of Christianity . ”
108948	108955	108956	108956	he	378	“ Are these opinions of yours , ”
108959	108968	108956	108956	he	378	“ derived from reading or your own reflection ? ”
108969	109138	109157	109158	de Grantmesnil	453	“ Well , from both , but from circumstances in life that induced me to read and reflect . I am one of the many victims of the tyrannical law of marriage . When very young I married a woman who made me miserable , and then forsook me . Morally , she has ceased to be my wife ; legally , she is . I then met with another woman who suits me , who loves me . She lives with me ; I can not marry her ; she has to submit to humiliations , to be called contemptuously an ouvrier ’s mistress . Then , though before I was only a Republican , I felt there was something wrong in society which needed a greater change than that of a merely political government ; and then , too , when I was all troubled and sore , I chanced to read one of Madame de Grantmesnil ’s books . A glorious genius that woman ’s ! ”
109139	109146	109148	109148	Graham	378	“ She has genius , certainly , ”
109166	109169	109170	109170	he	378	“ But , ”
109173	109263	109170	109170	he	378	“ though I believe that eloquent author has indirectly assailed certain social institutions , including that of marriage , I am perfectly persuaded that she never designed to effect such complete overthrow of the system which all civilized communities have hitherto held in reverence as your doctrines would attempt ; and , after all , she but expresses her ideas through the medium of fabulous incidents and characters . And men of your sense should not look for a creed in the fictions of poets and romance - writers . ”
109264	109267	109269	109269	Monnier	650	“ Ah , ”
109271	109355	109269	109269	Monnier	650	“ I dare say neither Madame de Grantmesnil nor even Rousseau ever even guessed the ideas they awoke in their readers ; but one idea leads on to another . And genuine poetry and romance touch the heart so much more than dry treatises . In a word , Madame de Grantmesnil ’s book set me thinking ; and then I read other books , and talked with clever men , and educated myself . And so I became the man I am . ”
109484	109496	109481	109481	he	634	“ A thousand pardons for disturbing your slumbers , Monsieur Lamb . ”
109525	109529	109518	109523	the person seated so near him	3813	“ Monsieur Lebeau ? ”
109530	109573	109470	109470	himself	634	“ At your service . I promise to give an answer to your question ; accept my apologies that it has been deferred so long . I shall not this evening go to our cafe . I took the liberty of calling — ”
109574	109583	109481	109481	he	634	“ Monsieur Lebeau , you are a brick . ”
109584	109591	109518	109523	the person seated so near him	3813	“ A what , Monsieur!—a brique ? ”
109592	109628	109470	109470	himself	634	“ I forgot ; you are not up to our fashionable London idioms . A brick means a jolly fellow , and it is very kind in you to call . What is your decision ? ”
109629	109740	109470	109470	himself	634	“ Monsieur , I can give you some information , but it is so slight that I offer it gratis , and forego all thought of undertaking further inquiries . They could only be prosecuted in another country , and it would not be worth my while to leave Paris on the chance of gaining so trifling a reward as you propose . Judge for yourself . In the year 1849 , and in the month of July , Louise Duval left Paris for Aix - la - Chapelle . There she remained some weeks , and then left it . I can learn no further traces of her movements . ”
109741	109754	109518	109523	the person seated so near him	3813	“ Aix - la - Chapelle ! What could she do there ? ”
109755	109786	109470	109470	himself	634	“ It is a Spa in great request ; crowded during the summer season with visitors from all countries . She might have gone there for health or for pleasure . ”
109787	109805	109470	109470	himself	634	“ Do you think that one could learn more at the Spa itself if one went there ? ”
109806	109817	109518	109523	the person seated so near him	3813	“ Possibly . But it is so long,—twenty years ago . ”
109818	109826	109470	109470	himself	634	“ She might have revisited the place . ”
109827	109836	109470	109470	himself	634	“ Certainly ; but I know no more . ”
109837	109846	109518	109523	the person seated so near him	3813	“ Was she there under the same name,—Duval ? ”
109847	109854	109470	109470	himself	634	“ I am sure of that . ”
109855	109881	109470	109470	himself	634	“ Do you think she left it alone or with others ? You tell me she was awfully belle ; she might have attracted admirers . ”
109882	109885	109887	109887	Lebeau	634	“ If , ”
109891	109995	109887	109887	Lebeau	634	“ I could believe the report of my informant , Louise Duval left Aix not alone , but with some gallant ; not an Englishman . They are said to have parted soon , and the man is now dead . But , speaking frankly , I do not think Mademoiselle Duval would have thus compromised her honour and sacrificed her future . I believe she would have scorned all proposals that were not those of marriage . But all I can say for certainty is that nothing is known to me of her fate since she quitted Aix - la - Chapelle . ”
109996	110007	109470	109470	himself	634	“ In 1849 ? She had then a child living . ”
110008	110035	110036	110036	Graham	378	“ A child ? I never heard that she had any child ; and I do not believe she could have had any child in 1849 . ”
110074	110078	110080	110080	Graham	378	“ Monsieur Lebeau , ”
110082	110133	110080	110080	Graham	378	“ you know this lady by sight ; you would recognize her in spite of the lapse of years . Will you go to Aix and find out there what you can ? Of course , expenses will be paid , and the reward will be given if you succeed . ”
110134	110198	109470	109470	himself	634	“ I can not oblige you . My interest in this poor lady is not very strong , though I should be willing to serve her , and glad to know that she were alive . I have now business on hand which interests me much more , and which will take me from Paris , but not in the direction of Aix . ”
110199	110227	110080	110080	Graham	378	“ If I wrote to my employer , and got him to raise the reward to some higher amount , that might make it worth your while ? ”
110228	110324	110080	110080	Graham	378	“ I should still answer that my affairs will not permit such a journey . But if there be any chance of tracing Louise Duval at Aix,—and there may be,—you would succeed quite as well as I should . You must judge for yourself if it be worth your trouble to attempt such a task ; and if you do attempt it , and do succeed , pray let me know.—A line to my office will reach me for some little time , even if I am absent from Paris . Adieu , Monsieur Lamb . ”
110352	110355	110358	110358	his	378	“ No , ”
110359	110514	110358	110358	his	378	meditations,—“no , it would not be safe to employ that man further . The reasons that forbid me to offer any very high reward for the discovery of this woman operate still more strongly against tendering to her own relation a sum that might indeed secure his aid , but would unquestionably arouse his suspicions , and perhaps drag into light all that must be concealed . Oh , this cruel mission ! I am , indeed , an impostor to myself till it be fulfilled . I will go to Aix , and take Renard with me . I am impatient till I set out , but I can not quit Paris without once more seeing Isaura . She consents to relinquish the stage ; surely I could wean her too from intimate friendship with a woman whose genius has so fatal an effect upon enthusiastic minds . And then — and then ? ”

110944	110987	110937	110937	Lebeau	634	“ So it is ; I was not aware of the time . But I am tired with waiting ; let me into the salon . I will wait for the rest ; I shall not be sorry for a little repose . ”

113278	113281	113283	113283	Lebeau	634	“ Confreres , ”
113294	113516	113283	113283	Lebeau	634	“ our number for the present seance is complete . To business . Since we last met , our cause has advanced with rapid and not with noiseless stride . I need not tell you that Louis Bonaparte has virtually abnegated Les idees Napoleoniennes,—a fatal mistake for him , a glorious advance for us . The liberty of the press must very shortly be achieved , and with it personal government must end . When the autocrat once is compelled to go by the advice of his ministers , look for sudden changes . His ministers will be but weathercocks , turned hither and thither according as the wind chops at Paris ; and Paris is the temple of the winds . The new revolution is almost at hand . [ Murmurs of applause . ] It would move the laughter of the Tuileries and its ministers , of the Bourse and of its gamblers , of every dainty salon of this silken city of would - be philosophers and wits , if they were told that here within this mouldering baraque , eight men , so little blessed by fortune , so little known to fame as ourselves , met to concert the fall of an empire . The Government would not deem us important enough to notice our existence . ”
113517	113523	113525	113526	the Pole	3923	“ I know not that , ”
113528	113533	113535	113536	the orator	9027	“ Ah , pardon , ”
113538	113788	113535	113536	the orator	9027	“ I should have confined my remark to the five of us who are French . I did injustice to the illustrious antecedents of our foreign allies . I know that you , Thaddeus Loubisky , that you , Leonardo Raselli , have been too eminent for hands hostile to tyrants not to be marked with a black cross in the books of the police ; I know that you , Jan Vanderstegen , if hitherto unscarred by those wounds in defence of freedom which despots and cowards would fain miscall the brands of the felon , still owe it to your special fraternity to keep your movements rigidly concealed . The tyrant would suppress the International Society , and forbids it the liberty of congress . To you three is granted the secret entrance to our council - hall . But we Frenchmen are as yet safe in our supposed insignificance . Confreres , permit me to impress on you the causes why , insignificant as we seem , we are really formidable . In the first place , we are few : the great mistake in most secret associations has been to admit many councillors ; and disunion enters wherever many tongues can wrangle . In the next place , though so few in council , we are legion when the time comes for action ; because we are representative men , each of his own section , and each section is capable of an indefinite expansion . “
113891	114003	114007	114008	the surgeon)—“you	10894	“ Of us five Frenchmen , let me speak more modestly . You , sage and scholar , Felix Ruvigny , honoured alike for the profundity of your science and the probity of your manners , induced to join us by your abhorrence of priestcraft and superstition,—you made a wide connection among all the enlightened reasoners who would emancipate the mind of man from the trammels of Church - born fable , and when the hour arrives in which it is safe to say , ‘ Delenda est Roma , ’ you know where to find the pens that are more victorious than swords against a Church and a Creed . You ”
114008	114112	114113	114113	You	3948	surgeon)—“you , Gaspard le Noy , whom a vile calumny has robbed of the throne in your profession so justly due to your skill , you , nobly scorning the rich and great , have devoted yourself to tend and heal the humble and the penniless , so that you have won the popular title of the ‘ Medecin des Pauvres , ’ when the time comes wherein soldiers shall fly before the sansculottes , and the mob shall begin the work which they who move mobs will complete , the clients of Gaspard le Noy will be the avengers of his wrongs . “
114403	115028	115029	115029	Confreres	702	“ According to that conception , while the council may communicate as it will with all societies , secret or open , having revolution for their object , the council refuses to merge itself in any other confederation ; it stands aloof and independent ; it declines to admit into its code any special articles of faith in a future beyond the bounds to which it limits its design and its force . That design unites us ; to go beyond would divide . We all agree to destroy the Napoleonic dynasty ; none of us might agree as to what we should place in its stead . All of us here present might say , ‘ A republic . ’ Ay , but of what kind ? Vanderstegen would have it socialistic ; Monnier goes further , and would have it communistic , on the principles of Fourier ; Le Noy adheres to the policy of Danton , and would commence the republic by a reign of terror ; our Italian ally abhors the notion of general massacre , and advocates individual assassination . Ruvigny would annihilate the worship of a Deity ; Monnier holds with Voltaire and Robespierre , that , ‘ if there were no Deity , it would be necessary to man to create one . ’ Bref , we could not agree upon any plan for the new edifice , and therefore we refuse to discuss one till the ploughshare has gone over the ruins of the old . But I have another and more practical reason for keeping our council distinct from all societies with professed objects beyond that of demolition . We need a certain command of money . It is I who bring to you that , and — how ? Not from my own resources,—they but suffice to support myself ; not by contributions from ouvriers who , as you well know , will subscribe only for their own ends in the victory of workmen over masters . I bring money to you from the coffers of the rich malcontents . Their politics are not those of most present ; their politics are what they term moderate . Some are indeed for a republic , but for a republic strong in defence of order , in support of property ; others — and they are more numerous and the more rich — for a constitutional monarchy , and , if possible , for the abridgment of universal suffrage , which in their eyes tends only to anarchy in the towns and arbitrary rule under priestly influence in the rural districts . They would not subscribe a sou if they thought it went to further the designs whether of Ruvigny the atheist , or of Monnier , who would enlist the Deity of Rousseau on the side of the drapeau rouge ; not a sou if they knew I had the honour to boast such confreres as I see around me . They subscribe , as we concert , for the fall of Bonaparte . The policy I adopt I borrow from the policy of the English Liberals . In England , potent millionnaires , high - born dukes , devoted Churchmen , belonging to the Liberal party , accept the services of men who look forward to measures which would ruin capital , eradicate aristocracy , and destroy the Church , provided these men combine with them in some immediate step onward against the Tories . They have a proverb which I thus adapt to French localities : if a train passes Fontainebleau on its way to Marseilles , why should I not take it to Fontainebleau because other passengers are going on to Marseilles ? “
115253	115303	115342	115343	M. Lebeau	634	“ Confreres , this affair settled , I proceed to distribute amongst you sums of which each who receives will render me an account , except our valued confrere the Pole . All that we can subscribe to the cause of humanity a representative of Poland requires for himself . ”

115547	115702	115533	115534	the president	3987	“ Confreres , our seance is now concluded . The period for our next meeting must remain indefinite , for I myself shall leave Paris as soon as I have set on foot the journal , on the details of which I will confer with citizen Rameau . I am not satisfied with the progress made by the two travelling missionaries who complete our Council of Ten ; and though I do not question their zeal , I think my experience may guide it if I take a journey to the towns of Bordeaux and Marseilles , where they now are . But should circumstances demanding concert or action arise , you may be sure that I will either summon a meeting or transmit instructions to such of our members as may be most usefully employed . For the present , confreres , you are relieved . Remain only you , dear young author . ”
115952	115956	115958	115958	Lebeau	634	“ Cher poete , ”
115963	116230	115958	115958	Lebeau	634	“ it gives me no mean pleasure to think I am opening a career to one whose talents fit him for those goals on which they who reach write names that posterity shall read . Struck with certain articles of yours in the journal made celebrated by the wit and gayety of Savarin , I took pains privately to inquire into your birth , your history , connections , antecedents . All confirmed my first impression,—that you were exactly the writer I wish to secure to our cause . I therefore sought you in your rooms , unintroduced and a stranger , in order to express my admiration of your compositions . Bref , we soon became friends ; and after comparing minds , I admitted you , at your request , into this Secret Council . Now , in proposing to you the conduct of the journal I would establish , for which I am prepared to find all necessary funds , I am compelled to make imperative conditions . Nominally you will be editor - in - chief : that station , if the journal succeeds , will secure you position and fortune ; if it fail , you fail with it . But we will not speak of failure ; I must have it succeed . Our interest , then , is the same . Before that interest all puerile vanities fade away . Nominally , I say , you are editor - in - chief ; but all the real work of editing will , at first , be done by others . ”
116231	116234	116236	116236	Rameau	551	“ Ah ! ”
116245	116270	116242	116242	Lebeau	634	“ To establish the journal I propose needs more than the genius of youth ; it needs the tact and experience of mature years . ”
116299	116307	116309	116309	Lebeau	634	“ A certain portion of the journal , ”
116311	116320	116309	116309	Lebeau	634	“ will be exclusively appropriated to your pen . ”
116328	116454	116321	116321	Rameau	551	“ But your pen must be therein restricted to compositions of pure fancy , disporting in a world that does not exist ; or , if on graver themes connected with the beings of the world that does exist , the subjects will be dictated to you and revised . Yet even in the higher departments of a journal intended to make way at its first start , we need the aid , not indeed of men who write better than you , but of men whose fame is established,—whose writings , good or bad , the public run to read , and will find good even if they are bad . You must consign one column to the playful comments and witticisms of Savarin . ”
116455	116518	116309	116309	Lebeau	634	“ Savarin ? But he has a journal of his own . He will not , as an author , condescend to write in one just set up by me ; and as a politician , he as certainly will not aid in an ultrademocratic revolution . If he care for politics at all , he is a constitutionalist , an Orleanist . ”
116519	117085	116321	116321	Rameau	551	“ Enfant ! as an author Savarin will condescend to contribute to your journal , first , because it in no way attempts to interfere with his own ; secondly,—I can tell you a secret , Savarin ’s journal no longer suffices for his existence . He has sold more than two - thirds of its property ; he is in debt , and his creditor is urgent ; and to - morrow you will offer Savarin thirty thousand francs for one column from his pen , and signed by his name , for two months from the day the journal starts . He will accept , partly because the sum will clear off the debt that hampers him , partly because he will take care that the amount becomes known ; and that will help him to command higher terms for the sale of the remaining shares in the journal he now edits , for the new book which you told me he intended to write , and for the new journal which he will be sure to set up as soon as he has disposed of the old one . You say that , as a politician , Savarin , an Orleanist , will not aid in an ultra - democratic revolution . Who asks him to do so ? Did I not imply at the meeting that we commence our journal with politics the mildest ? Though revolutions are not made with rose - water , it is rose - water that nourishes their roots . The polite cynicism of authors , read by those who float on the surface of society , prepares the way for the social ferment in its deeps . Had there been no Voltaire , there would have been no Camille Desmoulins ; had there been no Diderot , there would have been no Marat . We start as polite cynics . Of all cynics Savarin is the politest . But when I bid high for him , it is his clique that I bid for . Without his clique he is but a wit ; with his clique , a power . Partly out of that clique , partly out of a circle beyond it , which Savarin can more or less influence , I select ten . Here is the list of them ; study it . Entre nous , I esteem their writings as little as I do artificial flies ; but they are the artificial flies at which , in this particular season of the year , the public rise . You must procure at least five of the ten ; and I leave you carte blanche as to the terms . Savarin gained , the best of them will be proud of being his associates . Observe , none of these messieurs of brilliant imagination are to write political articles ; those will be furnished to you anonymously , and inserted without erasure or omission . When you have secured Savarin , and five at least of the collaborateurs in the list , write to me at my office . I give you four days to do this ; and the day the journal starts you enter into the income of fifteen thousand francs a year , with a rise in salary proportioned to profits . Are you contented with the terms ? ”
117086	117158	116321	116321	Rameau	551	“ Of course I am ; but supposing I do not gain the aid of Savarin , or five at least of the list you give , which I see at a glance contains names the most a la mode in this kind of writing , more than one of them of high social rank , whom it is difficult for me even to approach,—if , I say , I fail ? ”
117159	117319	116309	116309	Lebeau	634	“ What ! with a carte blanche of terms ? fie ! Are you a Parisian ? Well , to answer you frankly , if you fail in so easy a task , you are not the man to edit our journal , and I shall find another . Allez , courage ! Take my advice ; see Savarin the first thing to - morrow morning . Of course , my name and calling you will keep a profound secret from him , as from all . Say as mysteriously as you can that parties you are forbidden to name instruct you to treat with M. Savarin , and offer him the terms I have specified , the thirty thousand francs paid to him in advance the moment he signs the simple memorandum of agreement . The more mysterious you are , the more you will impose,—that is , wherever you offer money and do n’t ask for it . ”
117540	117544	117545	117545	he	536	“ There was , ”
117548	117622	117545	117545	he	536	“ much in certain words of yours , when we last walked together in this very path , that sank deeply into my mind at the time , and over which I have of late still more earnestly reflected . You spoke of the duties a Frenchman owed to France , and the ‘ impolicy ’ of remaining aloof from all public employment on the part of those attached to the Legitimist cause . ”
117623	117655	117529	117529	he	536	“ True ; it can not be the policy of any party to forget that between the irrevocable past and the uncertain future there intervenes the action of the present time . ”
117656	117681	117529	117529	he	536	“ Should you , as an impartial bystander , consider it dishonourable in me if I entered the military service under the ruling sovereign ? ”
117682	117692	117529	117529	he	536	“ Certainly not , if your country needed you . ”
117693	117754	117529	117529	he	536	“ And it may , may it not ? I hear vague rumours of coming war in almost every salon I frequent . There has been gunpowder in the atmosphere we breathe ever since the battle of Sadowa . What think you of German arrogance and ambition ? Will they suffer the swords of France to rust in their scabbards ? ”
117755	117894	117529	117529	he	536	“ My dear Marquis , I should incline to put the question otherwise . Will the jealous amour propre of France permit the swords of Germany to remain sheathed ? But in either case , no politician can see without grave apprehension two nations so warlike , close to each other , divided by a borderland that one covets and the other will not yield , each armed to the teeth,—the one resolved to brook no rival , the other equally determined to resist all aggression . And therefore , as you say , war is in the atmosphere ; and we may also hear , in the clouds that give no sign of dispersion , the growl of the gathering thunder . War may come any day ; and if France be not at once the victor — ”
117895	117903	117905	117905	Alain	351	“ France not at once the victor ? ”
117909	117925	117905	117905	Alain	351	“ and against a Prussian ! Permit me to say no Frenchman can believe that . ”
117926	117934	117936	117936	Graham	536	“ Let no man despise a foe , ”
117942	118008	117936	117936	Graham	536	“ However , I must not incur the danger of wounding your national susceptibilities . To return to the point you raise . If France needed the aid of her best and bravest , a true descendant of Henri Quatre ought to blush for his ancient noblesse were a Rochebriant to say , ‘ But I do n’t like the colour of the flag . ’ ”
118009	118013	118015	118015	Alain	351	“ Thank you , ”
118019	118024	118015	118015	Alain	351	“ that is enough . ”
118221	118314	118204	118204	he	536	“ You remind me of one subject in our talk many weeks since ; it is my duty to remind you of another . At that time you , and , speaking frankly , I myself , acknowledged the charm in the face of a young Italian lady . I told you then that , on learning she was intended for the stage , the charm for me had vanished . I said bluntly that it should vanish perhaps still more utterly for a noble of your illustrious name ; you remember ? ”
118315	118318	118320	118320	Alain	351	“ Yes , ”
118331	118536	118320	118320	Alain	351	“ I wish now to retract all I said thereon . Mademoiselle Cicogna is not bent on the profession for which she was educated . She would willingly renounce all idea of entering it . The only counterweight which , viewed whether by my reason or my prejudices , could be placed in the opposite scale to that of the excellences which might make any man proud to win her , is withdrawn . I have become acquainted with her since the date of our conversation . Hers is a mind which harmonizes with the loveliness of her face . In one word , Marquis , I should deem myself honoured , as well as blest , by such a bride . It was due to her that I should say this ; it was due also to you , in case you should retain the impression I sought in ignorance to efface . And I am bound , as a gentleman , to obey this twofold duty , even though in so doing I bring upon myself the affliction of a candidate for the hand to which I would fain myself aspire,—a candidate with pretensions in every way far superior to my own . ”
118579	118585	118586	118586	he	8274	“ I reply to you , ”
118589	118861	118586	118586	he	8274	“ with a frankness which finds an example in your own . The first fair face which attracted my fancy since my arrival at Paris was that of the Italian demoiselle of whom you speak in terms of such respect . I do think if I had then been thrown into her society , and found her to be such as you no doubt truthfully describe , that fancy might have become a very grave emotion . I was then so poor , so friendless , so despondent ! Your words of warning impressed me at the time , but less durably than you might suppose ; for that very night as I sat in my solitary attic I said to myself , ‘ Why should I shrink , with an obsolete old - world prejudice , from what my forefathers would have termed a mesalliance ? What is the value of my birthright now ? None,—worse than none . It excludes me from all careers ; my name is but a load that weighs me down . Why should I make that name a curse as well as a burden ? Nothing is left to me but that which is permitted to all men,—wedded and holy love . Could I win to my heart the smile of a woman who brings me that dower , the home of my fathers would lose its gloom . ’ And therefore , if at that time I had become familiarly acquainted with her who had thus attracted my eye and engaged my thoughts , she might have become my destiny ; but now ! ”
118862	118866	118569	118569	he	8274	“ But now ? ”
118867	119037	118586	118586	he	8274	“ Things have changed . I am no longer poor , friendless , solitary . I have entered the world of my equals as a Rochebriant ; I have made myself responsible for the dignity of my name . I could not give that name to one , however peerless in herself , of whom the world would say , ‘ But for her marriage she would have been a singer on the stage ! ’ I will own more : the fancy I conceived for the first fair face , other fair faces have dispelled . At this moment , however , I have no thought of marriage ; and having known the anguish of struggle , the privations of poverty , I would ask no woman to share the hazard of my return to them . You might present me , then , safely to this beautiful Italian,—certain , indeed , that I should be her admirer ; equally certain that I could not become your rival . ”

120044	120051	120053	120053	Savarin	431	“ We are come , Signorina , ”
120055	120220	120053	120053	Savarin	431	“ to announce to you a piece of news , and to hazard a petition . The news is this : my young friend here has found a Maecenas who has the good taste so to admire his lucubrations under the nom de plume of Alphonse de Valcour as to volunteer the expenses for starting a new journal , of which Gustave Rameau is to be editor - in - chief ; and I have promised to assist him as contributor for the first two months . I have given him notes of introduction to certain other feuilletonistes and critics whom he has on his list . But all put together would not serve to float the journal like a short roman from Madame de Grantmesnil . Knowing your intimacy with that eminent artist , I venture to back Rameau ’s supplication that you would exert your influence on his , behalf . As to the honoraires , she has but to name them . ”
120221	120225	120227	120227	Rameau	551	“ Carte blanche , ”
120231	120241	120243	120243	Isaura	536	“ You know Eulalie too well , Monsieur Savarin , ”
120251	120271	120243	120243	Isaura	536	“ to suppose that she is a mercenary in letters , and sells her services to the best bidder . ”
120272	120278	120280	120280	Savarin	431	“ Bah , belle enfant ! ”
120288	120449	120283	120283	his	431	“ Business is business , and books as well as razors are made to sell . But , of course , a proper prospectus of the journal must accompany your request to write in it . Meanwhile Rameau will explain to you , as he has done to me , that the journal in question is designed for circulation among readers of haute classe it is to be pleasant and airy , full of bons mots and anecdote ; witty , but not ill - natured . Politics to be Liberal , of course , but of elegant admixture,—champagne and seltzer - water . In fact , however , I suspect that the politics will be a very inconsiderable feature in this organ of fine arts and manners ; some amateur scribbler in the beau monde will supply them . For the rest , if my introductory letters are successful , Madame de Grantmesnil will not be in bad company . ”
120450	120459	120461	120461	Rameau	551	“ You will write to Madame de Grantmesnil ? ”
120465	120473	120461	120461	Rameau	551	“ Certainly I will , as soon — ”
120474	120490	120492	120492	Rameau	551	“ As soon as you have the prospectus , and the names of the collaborateurs , ”
120494	120507	120492	120492	Rameau	551	“ I hope to send you these in a very few days . ”
120590	120593	120595	120595	Savarin	431	“ Parbleu ! ”
120604	120616	120617	120617	he	431	“ but this is beautiful ; what is more , it is original,”—and
120640	120643	120645	120645	Savarin	431	“ Pardon , ”
120649	120727	120645	120645	Savarin	431	“ I confess my sin , but it was so unpremeditated that it does not merit a severe penance . Do not look at me so reproachfully . We all know that young ladies keep commonplace books in which they enter passages that strike them in the works they read ; and you have but shown an exquisite taste in selecting this gem . Do tell me where you found it . Is it somewhere in Lamartine ? ”
120728	120731	120733	120733	Isaura	536	“ No , ”
120767	120811	120812	120812	Rameau	551	“ It is your own , Signorina ! Accept the congratulations of a very practised and somewhat fastidious critic . If the rest of what you write resembles this sentence , contribute to Rameau ’s journal , and I answer for its success . ”
120821	120826	120828	120828	Savarin	431	“ My dear child , ”
120842	120877	120828	120828	Savarin	431	“ do permit me to cast a glance over these papers . For what I yet know , there may be here more promise of fame than even you could gain as a singer . ”
120923	120934	120936	120936	Isaura	536	“ Nay , this can not be worth your reading , ”
120940	120963	120964	120964	she	4052	“ I have never written anything of the kind before , and this is a riddle to me . I know not , ”
120973	120985	120964	120964	she	4052	“ why I began , nor how I should end it . ”
120986	120992	120994	120994	Savarin	431	“ So much the better , ”
121137	121140	121142	121142	Rameau	551	“ Oh , ”
121144	121264	121142	121142	Rameau	551	“ I am at the turning - point of my life . Ever since boyhood I have been haunted with the words of Andre Chenier on the morning he was led to the scaffold ‘ And yet there was something here , ’ striking his forehead . Yes , I , poor , low - born , launching myself headlong in the chase of a name ; I , underrated , uncomprehended , indebted even for a hearing to the patronage of an amiable trifler like Savarin , ranked by petty rivals in a grade below themselves,—I now see before me , suddenly , abruptly presented , the expanding gates into fame and fortune . Assist me , you ! ”
121265	121269	121271	121271	Isaura	536	“ But how ? ”
121287	121290	121292	121292	Rameau	551	“ How ! ”
121294	121387	121292	121292	Rameau	551	“ how ! But do you not see — or at least , do you not conjecture — this journal of which Savarin speaks contains my present and my future ? Present independence , opening to fortune and renown . Ay,—and who shall say ? renown beyond that of the mere writer . Behind the gaudy scaffolding of this rickety Empire , a new social edifice unperceived arises ; and in that edifice the halls of State shall be given to the men who help obscurely to build it,—to men like me . ”
121422	121451	121419	121419	he	551	“ Plead for me with your whole mind and heart ; use your uttermost influence with the illustrious writer whose pen can assure the fates of my journal . ”
121671	121677	121679	121679	Savarin	431	“ Son of perfidious Albion , ”
121683	121703	121679	121679	Savarin	431	“ we feared you had deserted the French alliance . Welcome back to Paris , and the entente cordiale . ”
121704	121721	121668	121668	his	431	“ Would I could stay to enjoy such welcome ! but I must again quit Paris . ”
121722	121772	121679	121679	Savarin	431	“ Soon to return , n’est ce pas ? Paris is an irresistible magnet to les beaux esprits . A propos of beaux esprits , be sure to leave orders with your bookseller , if you have one , to enter your name as subscriber to a new journal . ”
121773	121782	121679	121679	Savarin	431	“ Certainly , if Monsieur Savarin recommends it . ”
121783	121798	121800	121800	Rameau	551	“ He recommends it as a matter of course ; he writes in it , ”
121802	121818	121800	121800	Rameau	551	“ A sufficient guarantee for its excellence . What is the name of the journal ? ”
121819	121825	121827	121827	Savarin	431	“ Not yet thought of , ”
121829	121860	121827	121827	Savarin	431	“ Babes must be born before they are christened ; but it will be instruction enough to your bookseller to order the new journal to be edited by Gustave Rameau . ”
121875	121895	121869	121869	Graham	536	“ May I hope that in the department of criticism you will not be too hard upon poor Tasso ? ”
121896	121915	121917	121917	Savarin	431	“ Never fear ; the Signorina , who adores Tasso , will take him under her special protection , ”
121933	121936	121937	121937	he	536	“ Mademoiselle , ”
121940	121957	121937	121937	he	536	“ is then to be united in the conduct of this journal with M. Gustave Rameau ? ”
121958	121963	121965	121965	Isaura	536	“ No , indeed ! ”
121973	121978	121980	121980	Savarin	431	“ But I hope , ”
121982	122043	121980	121980	Savarin	431	“ that the Signorina may become a contributor too important for an editor to offend by insulting her favourites , Tasso included . Rameau and I came hither to entreat her influence with her intimate and illustrious friend , Madame de Grantmesnil , to insure the success of our undertaking by sanctioning the announcement of her name as a contributor . ”
122044	122054	122056	122056	Graham	536	“ Upon social questions,—such as the laws of marriage ? ”
122077	122080	122082	122082	Savarin	431	“ Nay , ”
122084	122149	122151	122151	he	431	“ our journal will be too sportive , I hope , for matters so profound . We would rather have Madame de Grantmesnil ’s aid in some short roman , which will charm the fancy of all and offend the opinions of none . But since I came into the room , I care less for the Signorina ’s influence with the great authoress , ”
122158	122162	122164	122164	Graham	536	“ How so ? ”
122172	122195	122164	122164	Graham	536	“ If the writer of this manuscript will conclude what she has begun , we shall be independent of Madame de Grantmesnil . ”
122196	122199	122201	122201	Isaura	536	“ Fie ! ”
122211	122219	122220	122220	Graham	536	blushes,—“fie ! such words are a mockery . ”
122240	122257	122234	122234	He	536	“ Mademoiselle then is an author ? In the style of her friend Madame de Grantmesnil ? ”
122258	122261	122263	122263	Savarin	431	“ Bah ! ”
122265	122438	122263	122263	Savarin	431	“ I should indeed be guilty of mockery if I paid the Signorina so false a compliment as to say that in a first effort she attained to the style of one of the most finished sovereigns of language that has ever swayed the literature of France . When I say , ‘ Give us this tale completed , and I shall be consoled if the journal does not gain the aid of Madame de Grantmesnil , ’ I mean that in these pages there is that nameless charm of freshness and novelty which compensates for many faults never committed by a practised pen like Madame de Grantmesnil ’s . My dear young lady , go on with this story,—finish it ; when finished , do not disdain any suggestions I may offer in the way of correction,—and I will venture to predict to you so brilliant a career as author , that you will not regret should you resign for that career the bravoes you could command as actress and singer . ”
122729	122732	122734	122734	she	4076	“ If , ”
122740	122774	122734	122734	she	4076	“ if this be true , my proud ambition is realized ; all disparities of worth and fortune are annulled between me and him to whom I would bring no shame of mesalliance ! ”
122781	122792	122794	122794	Rameau	551	“ You will let me see what you have written , ”
122819	122828	122794	122794	Rameau	551	“ No , not now ; when finished . ”
122829	122835	122794	122794	Rameau	551	“ You will finish it ? ”
122836	122850	122851	122851	She	4076	“ Oh , yes ; how can I help it after such encouragement ? ”
122995	123005	123007	123007	Savarin	431	“ Will you dine with me to - morrow ? ”
123009	123027	123007	123007	Savarin	431	“ Perhaps I may induce the Signorina and Rameau to offer you the temptation of meeting them . ”
123028	123039	123040	123040	Isaura	536	“ By to - morrow I shall be leagues away . ”
123053	123063	123065	123065	Savarin	431	“ You never said you were going so soon , ”
123067	123077	123065	123065	Savarin	431	“ When do you come back , vile deserter ? ”
123078	123117	123118	123118	Isaura	536	“ I can not even guess . Monsieur Rameau , count me among your subscribers . Mademoiselle , my best regards to Signora Venosta . When I see you again , no doubt you will have become famous . ”
123143	123156	123157	123157	she	4085	“ But not famous in the way that you warned me from , ”
123163	123171	123157	123157	she	4085	“ You are friends with me still ? ”
123257	123271	123254	123254	He	536	“ Yes , always a friend , if you could ever need one . ”
123287	123296	123298	123298	Savarin	431	“ Have you your coupe at the door ? ”
123300	123305	123279	123279	she	4085	“ Simply a fiacre . ”
123306	123316	123254	123254	He	536	“ And are going back at once to Paris ? ”
123317	123320	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ Yes . ”
123321	123333	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ Will you kindly drop me in the Rue de Rivoli ? ”
123334	123341	123254	123254	He	536	“ Charmed to be of use . ”
123356	123443	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ I can not conceive what rich simpleton could entertain so high an opinion of Gustave Rameau as to select a man so young , and of reputation though promising so undecided , for an enterprise which requires such a degree of tact and judgment as the conduct of a new journal,—and a journal , too , which is to address itself to the beau monde . However , it is not for me to criticise a selection which brings a god - send to myself . ”
123444	123485	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ To yourself ? You jest ; you have a journal of your own . It can only be through an excess of good - nature that you lend your name and pen to the service of M. Gustave Rameau . ”
123486	123687	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ My good - nature does not go to that extent . It is Rameau who confers a service upon me . Peste ! mon cher , we French authors have not the rents of you rich English milords . And though I am the most economical of our tribe , yet that journal of mine has failed me of late ; and this morning I did not exactly see how I was to repay a sum I had been obliged to borrow of a money - lender,—for I am too proud to borrow of friends , and too sagacious to borrow of publishers,—when in walks ce cher petit Gustave with an offer , for a few trifles towards starting this new - born journal , which makes a new man of me . Now I am in the undertaking , my amour propre and my reputation are concerned in its success ; and I shall take care that collaborateurs of whose company I am not ashamed are in the same boat . But that charming girl , Isaura ! What an enigma the gift of the pen is ! No one can ever guess who has it until tried . ”
123688	123706	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ The young lady ’s manuscript , then , really merits the praise you bestowed on it ? ”
123707	123792	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ Much more praise , though a great deal of blame , which I did not bestow,—for in a first work faults insure success as much as beauties . Anything better than tame correctness . Yes , her first work , to judge by what is written , must make a hit,—a great hit . And that will decide her career . A singer , an actress , may retire,—often does when she marries an author ; but once an author always an author . ”
123793	123818	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ Ah ! is it so ? If you had a beloved daughter , Savarin , would you encourage her to be an author ? ”
123819	123855	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ Frankly , no : principally because in that case the chances are that she would marry an author ; and French authors , at least in the imaginative school , make very uncomfortable husbands . ”
123856	123874	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ Ah ! you think the Signorina will marry one of those uncomfortable husbands,—M. Rameau , perhaps ? ”
123875	124048	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ Rameau ! Hein ! nothing more likely . That beautiful face of his has its fascination . And to tell you the truth , my wife , who is a striking illustration of the truth that what woman wills heaven wills , is bent upon that improvement in Gustave ’s moral life which she thinks a union with Mademoiselle Cicogna would achieve . At all events , the fair Italian would have in Rameau a husband who would not suffer her to bury her talents under a bushel . If she succeeds as a writer ( by succeeding I mean making money ) , he will see that her ink - bottle is never empty ; and if she do n’t succeed as a writer , he will take care that the world shall gain an actress or a singer . For Gustave Rameau has a great taste for luxury and show ; and whatever his wife can make , I will venture to say that he will manage to spend . ”
124049	124078	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ I thought you had an esteem and regard for Mademoiselle Cicogna . It is Madame your wife , I suppose , who has a grudge against her ? ”
124079	124089	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ On the contrary , my wife idolizes her . ”
124090	124118	123352	123353	the former	4092	“ Savages sacrifice to their idols the things they deem of value ; civilized Parisians sacrifice their idols themselves , and to a thing that is worthless . ”
124119	124274	124275	124276	The Englishman	8366	“ Rameau is not worthless ; he has beauty and youth and talent . My wife thinks more highly of him than I do ; but I must respect a man who has found admirers so sincere as to set him up in a journal , and give him carte blanche for terms to contributors . I know of no man in Paris more valuable to me . His worth to me this morning is thirty thousand francs . I own I do not think him likely to be a very safe husband ; but then French female authors and artists seldom take any husbands except upon short leases . There are no vulgar connubial prejudices in the pure atmosphere of art . Women of genius , like Madame de Grantmesnil , and perhaps like our charming young friend , resemble canary - birds,—to sing their best you must separate them from their mates . ”
124307	124310	124311	124311	he	8366	“ No , ”
124315	124620	124311	124311	he	8366	“ I must wrench myself from the very memory of that haunting face,—the friend and pupil of Madame de Grantmesnil , the associate of Gustave Rameau , the rival of Julie Caumartin , the aspirant to that pure atmosphere of art in which there are no vulgar connubial prejudices ! Could I — whether I be rich or poor — see in her the ideal of an English wife ? As it is — as it is — with this mystery which oppresses me , which , till solved , leaves my own career insoluble,—as it is , how fortunate that I did not find her alone ; did not utter the words that would fain have leaped from my heart ; did not say , ‘ I may not be the rich man I seem , but in that case I shall be yet more ambitious , because struggle and labour are the sinews of ambition ! Should I be rich , will you adorn my station ? Should I be poor , will you enrich poverty with your smile ? And can you , in either case , forego — really , painlessly forego , as you led me to hope — the pride in your own art ? ’ My ambition were killed did I marry an actress , a singer . Better that than the hungerer after excitements which are never allayed , the struggler in a career which admits of no retirement,—the woman to whom marriage is no goal , who remains to the last the property of the public , and glories to dwell in a house of glass into which every bystander has a right to peer . Is this the ideal of an Englishman ’s wife and home ? No , no!—woe is me , no ! ”

124956	124961	124963	124963	Savarin	431	“ You flatter me , ”
124967	125173	124963	124963	Savarin	431	“ but I own I do think there is a smattering of philosophy in that trifle . Perhaps , however , the character of a people depends more on its drinks than its food . The wines of Italy , heady , irritable , ruinous to the digestion , contribute to the character which belongs to active brains and disordered livers . The Italians conceive great plans , but they can not digest them . The English common - people drink beer , and the beerish character is stolid , rude , but stubborn and enduring . The English middle - class imbibe port and sherry ; and with these strong potations their ideas become obfuscated . Their character has no liveliness ; amusement is not one of their wants ; they sit at home after dinner and doze away the fumes of their beverage in the dulness of domesticity . If the English aristocracy are more vivacious and cosmopolitan , it is thanks to the wines of France , which it is the mode with them to prefer ; but still , like all plagiarists , they are imitators , not inventors ; they borrow our wines and copy our manners . The Germans — ”
125174	125178	125180	125182	the French Colonel	4115	“ Insolent barbarians ! ”
125188	125209	125180	125182	the French Colonel	4115	“ if the Emperor were not in his dotage , their Sadowa would ere this have cost them their Rhine . ”
125210	125214	125216	125216	Savarin	431	“ The Germans , ”
125222	125442	125216	125216	Savarin	431	“ drink acrid wines , varied with beer , to which last their commonalty owes a quasi resemblance in stupidity and endurance to the English masses . Acrid wines rot the teeth Germans are afflicted with toothache from infancy . All people subject to toothache are sentimental . Goethe was a martyr to toothache . ‘ Werther ’ was written in one of those paroxysms which predispose genius to suicide . But the German character is not all toothache ; beer and tobacco step in to the relief of Rhenish acridities , blend philosophy with sentiment , and give that patience in detail which distinguishes their professors and their generals . Besides , the German wines in themselves have other qualities than that of acridity . Taken with sourkrout and stewed prunes , they produce fumes of self - conceit . A German has little of French vanity ; he has German self - esteem . He extends the esteem of self to those around him ; his home , his village , his city , his country,—all belong to him . It is a duty he owes to himself to defend them . Give him his pipe and his sabre , and , Monsieur le Colonel , believe me , you will never take the Rhine from him . ”
125443	125450	125452	125453	the Colonel	2226	“ P - r - r , ”
125455	125463	125452	125453	the Colonel	2226	“ but we have had the Rhine . ”
125464	125497	125216	125216	Savarin	431	“ We did not keep it . And I should not say I had a francpiece if I borrowed it from your purse and had to give it back the next day . ”
125529	125580	125514	125514	Enguerrand	564	“ Let us leave these poor wretches to their sour wines and toothaches . We drinkers of the champagne , all our own , have only pity for the rest of the human race . This new journal ‘ Le Sens Commun ’ has a strange title , Monsieur Savarin . ”
125581	125608	125452	125453	the Colonel	2226	“ Yes ; ‘ Le Sens Commun ’ is not common in Paris , where we all have too much genius for a thing so vulgar . ”
125609	125612	125614	125616	the young painter	4118	“ Pray , ”
125618	125637	125614	125616	the young painter	4118	“ tell me what you mean by the title ‘ Le Sens Commun . ’ It is mysterious . ”
125638	125641	125643	125643	Savarin	431	“ True , ”
125645	125701	125643	125643	Savarin	431	“ it may mean the Sensus communis of the Latins , or the Good Sense of the English . The Latin phrase signifies the sense of the common interest ; the English phrase , the sense which persons of understanding have in common . I suppose the inventor of our title meant the latter signification . ”
125702	125709	125711	125711	Bacourt	550	“ And who was the inventor ? ”
125713	125725	125727	125727	Savarin	431	“ That is a secret which I do not know myself , ”
125729	125733	125735	125735	Enguerrand	564	“ I guess , ”
125737	125836	125735	125735	Enguerrand	564	“ that it must be the same person who writes the political leaders . They are most remarkable ; for they are so unlike the articles in other journals , whether those journals be the best or the worst . For my own part , I trouble my head very little about politics , and shrug my shoulders at essays which reduce the government of flesh and blood into mathematical problems . But these articles seem to be written by a man of the world , and as a man of the world myself , I read them . ”
125837	125840	125842	125845	the Vicomte de Breze	506	“ But , ”
125857	125888	125849	125849	himself	506	“ they are certainly not the composition of any eminent writer . No eloquence , no sentiment ; though I ought not to speak disparagingly of a fellow - contributor . ”
125889	125897	125899	125899	Savarin	431	“ All that may be very true ; ”
125901	126004	125899	125899	Savarin	431	“ but M. Enguerrand is right . The papers are evidently the work of a man of the world , and it is for that reason that they have startled the public , and established the success of ‘ Le Sens Commun . ’ But wait a week or two longer , Messieurs , and then tell me what you think of a new roman by a new writer , which we shall announce in our impression to - morrow . I shall be disappointed , indeed , if that does not charm you . No lack of eloquence and sentiment there . ”
126005	126015	126017	126017	Enguerrand	564	“ I am rather tired of eloquence and sentiment , ”
126019	126065	126017	126017	Enguerrand	564	“ Your editor , Gustave Rameau , sickens me of them with his ‘ Starlit Meditations in the Streets of Paris , ’ morbid imitations of Heine ’s enigmatical ‘ Evening Songs . ’ Your journal would be perfect if you could suppress the editor . ”
126066	126071	126073	126073	Bernard	589	“ Suppress Gustave Rameau ! ”
126078	126092	126073	126073	Bernard	589	“ I adore his poems , full of heart for poor suffering humanity . ”
126093	126106	126108	126109	the physician	2459	“ Suffering humanity so far as it is packed up in himself , ”
126111	126253	126108	126109	the physician	2459	dryly,—“and a great deal of the suffering is bile . But a propos of your new journal , Savarin , there is a paragraph in it to - day which excites my curiosity . It says that the Vicomte de Mauleon has arrived in Paris , after many years of foreign travel ; and then , referring modestly enough to the reputation for talent which he had acquired in early youth , proceeds to indulge in a prophecy of the future political career of a man who , if he have a grain of sens common , must think that the less said about him the better . I remember him well ; a terrible mauvais sujet , but superbly handsome . There was a shocking story about the jewels of a foreign duchess , which obliged him to leave Paris . ”
126254	126257	126259	126259	Savarin	431	“ But , ”
126261	126323	126259	126259	Savarin	431	“ the paragraph you refer to hints that that story is a groundless calumny , and that the true reason for De Mauleon ’s voluntary self - exile was a very common one among young Parisians,—he had lavished away his fortune . He returns , when , either by heritage or his own exertions , he has secured elsewhere a competence . ”
126324	126336	126338	126338	Bacourt	550	“ Nevertheless I can not think that society will receive him , ”
126340	126384	126338	126338	Bacourt	550	“ When he left Paris , there was one joyous sigh of relief among all men who wished to avoid duels , and keep their wives out of temptation . Society may welcome back a lost sheep , but not a reinvigorated wolf . ”
126385	126394	126396	126396	Enguerrand	564	“ I beg your pardon , mon cher , ”
126398	126637	126396	126396	Enguerrand	564	“ society has already opened its fold to this poor ill - treated wolf . Two days ago Louvier summoned to his house the surviving relations or connections of De Mauleon — among whom are the Marquis de Rochebriant , the Counts de Passy , De Beauvilliers , De Chavigny , my father , and of course his two sons — and submitted to us the proofs which completely clear the Vicomte de Mauleon of even a suspicion of fraud or dishonour in the affair of the jewels . The proofs include the written attestation of the Duke himself , and letters from that nobleman after De Mauleon ’s disappearance from Paris , expressive of great esteem , and indeed , of great admiration , for the Vicomte ’s sense of honour and generosity of character . The result of this family council was that we all went in a body to call on De Mauleon ; and he dined with my father that same day . You know enough of the Comte de Vandemar , and , I may add , of my mother , to be sure that they are both , in their several ways , too regardful of social conventions to lend their countenance even to a relation without well weighing the pros and cons . And as for Raoul , Bayard himself could not be a greater stickler on the point of honour . ”
126657	126687	126654	126654	Duplessis	361	“ But what has Louvier to do in this galere ? Louvier is no relation of that well - born vaurien ; why should he summon your family council ? ”
126688	126791	127078	127078	Duplessis	361	“ Louvier excused his interference on the ground of early and intimate friendship with De Mauleon , who , he said , came to consult him on arriving at Paris , and who felt too proud or too timid to address relations with whom he had long dropped all intercourse . An intermediary was required , and Louvier volunteered to take that part on himself ; nothing more natural nor more simple . By the way , Alain , you dine with Louvier to - morrow , do you not?—a dinner in honour of our rehabilitated kinsman . I and Raoul go . ”
126792	126817	126819	126819	Alain	351	“ Yes , I shall be charmed to meet again a man who , whatever might be his errors in youth , on which , ”
126824	126888	126819	126819	Alain	351	“ it certainly does not become me to be severe , must have suffered the most poignant anguish a man of honour can undergo,—namely , honour suspected ; and who now , whether by years or sorrow , is so changed that I can not recognize a likeness to the character I have just heard given to him as mauvais sujet and vaurien . ”
126889	126892	126894	126894	Enguerrand	564	“ Bravo ! ”
126896	126912	126894	126894	Enguerrand	564	“ all honour to courage!—and at Paris it requires great courage to defend the absent . ”
126913	126916	126918	126918	Alain	351	“ Nay , ”
126925	126950	126918	126918	Alain	351	“ The gentilhomme who will not defend another gentilhomme traduced , would , as a soldier , betray a citadel and desert a flag . ”
126951	126960	126962	126963	De Breze	514	“ You say M. de Mauleon is changed , ”
126965	126982	126962	126963	De Breze	514	“ yes , he must be growing old . No trace left of his good looks ? ”
126983	126987	126989	126989	Enguerrand	564	“ Pardon me , ”
126991	127061	126989	126989	Enguerrand	564	“ he is bien conserve , and has still a very handsome head and an imposing presence . But one can not help doubting whether he deserved the formidable reputation he acquired in youth ; his manner is so singularly mild and gentle , his conversation so winningly modest , so void of pretence , and his mode of life is as simple as that of a Spanish hidalgo . ”
127062	127076	127078	127078	Duplessis	361	“ He does not , then , affect the role of Monte Cristo , ”
127080	127092	127078	127078	Duplessis	361	“ and buy himself into notice like that hero of romance ? ”
127093	127151	126989	126989	Enguerrand	564	“ Certainly not : he says very frankly that he has but a very small income , but more than enough for his wants,—richer than in his youth , for he has learned content . We may dismiss the hint in ‘ Le Sens Commun ’ about his future political career,—at least he evinces no such ambition . ”
127152	127160	127162	127162	Alain	351	“ How could he as a Legitimist ? ”
127166	127173	127162	127162	Alain	351	“ What department would elect him ? ”
127174	127181	127183	127184	De Breze	514	“ But is he a Legitimist ? ”
127186	127198	127200	127200	Alain	351	“ I take it for granted that he must be that , ”
127204	127212	127200	127200	Alain	351	“ for he is a De Mauleon . ”
127213	127228	127230	127231	De Breze	514	“ His father was as good a De Mauleon as himself , I presume , ”
127235	127312	127230	127231	De Breze	514	“ and he enjoyed a place at the Court of Louis Philippe , which a Legitimist could scarcely accept . Victor did not , I fancy , trouble his head about politics at all , at the time I remember him ; but to judge by his chief associates , and the notice he received from the Princes of the House of Orleans , I should guess that he had no predilections in favour of Henri V. ”
127313	127321	127323	127323	Alain	351	“ I should regret to think so , ”
127329	127347	127323	127323	Alain	351	“ since the De Mauleons acknowledge the head of their house in the representative of the Rochebriants . ”
127348	127353	127355	127355	Duplessis	361	“ At all events , ”
127357	127391	127355	127355	Duplessis	361	“ M. de Mauleon appears to be a philosopher of rare stamp . A Parisian who has known riches and is contented to be poor is a phenomenon I should like to study . ”
127392	127405	127407	127407	Enguerrand	564	“ You have that chance to - morrow evening , Monsieur Duplessis , ”
127409	127441	127407	127407	Enguerrand	564	“ What ! at M. Louvier ’s dinner ? Nay , I have no other acquaintance with M. Louvier than that of the Bourse , and the acquaintance is not cordial . ”
127442	127477	127230	127231	De Breze	514	“ I did not mean at M. Louvier ’s dinner , but at the Duchesse de Tarascon ’s ball . You , as one of her special favourites , will doubtless honour her reunion . ”
127478	127525	127355	127355	Duplessis	361	“ Yes ; I have promised my daughter to go to the ball . But the Duchesse is Imperialist . M. de Mauleon seems to be either a Legitimist , according to Monsieur le Marquis , or an Orleanist , according to our friend De Breze . ”
127526	127582	127407	127407	Enguerrand	564	“ What of that ? Can there be a more loyal Bourbonite than De Rochebriant?—and he goes to the ball . It is given out of the season , in celebration of a family marriage . And the Duchesse de Tarascon is connected with Alain , and therefore with De Mauleon , though but distantly . ”
127583	127592	127230	127231	De Breze	514	“ Ah ! excuse my ignorance of genealogy . ”
127593	127608	127610	127610	Alain	351	“ As if the genealogy of noble names were not the history of France , ”
127617	127620	127230	127231	De Breze	514	“ Sens Commun ”
127797	127801	127764	127764	Gustave	734	“ Sens Commun , ”
128149	128153	128126	128135	the turbulent many , without the clamps of a creed	4139	journal,—“Common - sense . ”
128631	128711	128627	128627	He	574	“ Of every charge which society made against this man he is guiltless ; but of all the claims to admiration which society accorded to him before it erroneously condemned , there are none which make me covet his friendship , or suffice to dispel doubts as to what he may be when society once more receives him . And the man is so captivating that I should dread his influence over myself did I see much of him . ”
129471	129489	129466	129466	You	4200	“ That is a man of some marked individuality , an eminence of some kind in himself . ”
129695	129702	129704	129704	Enguerrand	564	“ In this crowd , Vicomte , ”
129706	129716	129704	129704	Enguerrand	564	“ there must be many old acquaintances of yours ? ”
129717	129731	129733	129733	he	564	“ Perhaps so , but as yet I have only seen new faces . ”
129845	129853	129855	129855	Enguerrand	564	“ Do you not recognize his Excellency ? ”
129859	129870	129855	129855	Enguerrand	564	“ His can not be a new face to you . ”
129871	129879	129881	129882	De Mauleon	597	“ Is it the Baron de Lacy ? ”
129884	129923	129881	129882	De Mauleon	597	“ The Baron de Lacy , now Comte d’Epinay , ambassador at the Court of — — - , and , if report speak true , likely soon to exchange that post for the porte feuille of Minister . ”
129924	129957	129855	129855	Enguerrand	564	“ He has got on in life since I saw him last , the little Baron . He was then my devoted imitator , and I was not proud of the imitation . ”
129958	130040	129855	129855	Enguerrand	564	“ He has got on by always clinging to the skirts of some one stronger than himself,—to yours , I dare say , when , being a parvenu despite his usurped title of baron , he aspired to the entree into clubs and salons . The entree thus obtained , the rest followed easily ; he became a millionaire through a wife ’s dot , and an ambassador through the wife ’s lover , who is a power in the State . ”
130041	130106	130193	130193	he	597	“ But he must have substance in himself . Empty bags can not be made to stand upright . Ah ! unless I mistake , I see some one I knew better . Yon pale , thin man , also with the grand cross — surely that is Alfred Hennequin . Is he too a decorated Imperialist ? I left him a socialistic Republican . ”
130107	130169	130193	130193	he	597	“ But , I presume , even then an eloquent avocat . He got into the Chamber , spoke well , defended the coup - d’etat . He has just been made Prefet of the great department of the a popular appointment . He bears a high character . Pray renew your acquaintance with him ; he is coming this way . ”
130170	130185	130193	130193	he	597	“ Will so grave a dignitary renew acquaintance with me ? I doubt it . ”
130232	130237	130221	130222	The Prefet	749	“ Pardon me,—some mistake . ”
130238	130245	130247	130247	Enguerrand	564	“ Allow me , Monsieur Hennequin , ”
130264	130290	130221	130222	The Prefet	749	himself,—“allow me to reintroduce you to my kinsman , whom the lapse of years may well excuse you for forgetting , the Vicomte de Mauleon . ”
130308	130322	130300	130300	He	2176	“ I was not aware that Monsieur le Vicomte had returned to Paris , ”
130338	130342	130344	130344	Enguerrand	564	“ The insolent ! ”
130346	130349	130351	130352	De Mauleon	597	“ Hush ! ”
130356	130454	130351	130352	De Mauleon	597	“ I can fight no more duels,—especially with a Prefet . But I own I am weak enough to feel hurt at such a reception from Hennequin , for he owed me some obligations,—small , perhaps , but still they were such as might have made me select him , rather than Louvier , as the vindicator of my name , had I known him to be so high placed . But a man who has raised himself into an authority may well be excused for forgetting a friend whose character needs defence . I forgive him . ”
130569	130573	130574	130574	she	4227	“ The Princess , ”
130577	130602	130574	130574	she	4227	“ has been swept off in the train of some German Royalty ; so , petit pere , I must impose myself on thee . ”
130622	130635	130637	130638	the financier	2098	“ And I suppose I must take thee back into the ballroom , ”
130643	130649	130637	130638	the financier	2098	“ and find thee partners . ”
130650	130674	130637	130638	the financier	2098	“ I do n’t want your aid for that , Monsieur ; except this quadrille , my list is pretty well filled up . ”
130675	130692	130693	130693	he	2098	“ And I hope the partners will be pleasant . Let me know who they are , ”
130714	130732	130707	130708	The girl	9303	“ Well , the first on the list is milord somebody , with an unpronounceable English name . ”
130733	130737	130751	130751	Duplessis	361	“ Beau cavalier ? ”
130738	130750	130751	130751	Duplessis	361	“ No ; ugly , old too ; thirty at least . ”
130769	130774	130755	130755	He	361	“ And the next ? ”
130775	130779	130780	130780	she	9303	“ The next ? ”
130795	130805	130780	130780	she	9303	“ Yes , the next . Not English too ? ”
130806	130816	130755	130755	He	361	“ Oh , no ; the Marquis de Rochebriant . ”
130817	130826	130839	130839	Duplessis	361	“ Ah ! who presented him to thee ? ”
130827	130838	130839	130839	Duplessis	361	“ Thy friend , petit pere , M. de Braze . ”
130855	130861	130839	130839	Duplessis	361	“ Is he ugly also ? ”
130862	130865	130867	130868	the girl	9303	“ Ugly ! ”
130872	130878	130879	130879	she	9303	“ why , he is — ”
131056	131066	131068	131068	Duplessis	361	“ If disposed to fall in love with Valerie , ”
131070	131107	131068	131068	Duplessis	361	“ he would have taken more pains to please her father . Well , thank heaven , there are better matches to be found for her than a noble without fortune and a Legitimist without career . ”
131156	131168	131151	131152	De Braze	754	“ Yes , she is charming ; I will present you , ”
131256	131269	131243	131243	he	351	“ Do you not think it a very pleasant ball , Mademoiselle ? ”
131270	131273	131300	131300	Valerie	752	“ Yes , ”
131287	131299	131300	131300	Valerie	752	“ And not over - crowded , as most balls are ? ”
131329	131366	131322	131322	Alain	351	“ They tell me the last season was more than usually gay ; of that I can not judge , for it was well - nigh over when I came to Paris for the first time . ”
131390	131401	131367	131367	Valerie	752	“ This is my first ball , Monsieur le Marquis . ”
131402	131415	131417	131417	Alain	351	“ One has only to look at Mademoiselle to divine that fact , ”
132043	132050	132052	132053	De Mauleon	597	“ Wait till to - morrow , ”
132055	132077	132052	132053	De Mauleon	597	“ take no step till then . Meanwhile , you are in my hands , and I answer for your honour . ”
132168	132180	132182	132183	the spadassin	4291	“ Why on earth did you fasten a quarrel on me ? ”
132185	132217	132182	132183	the spadassin	4291	“ and why , having done so , did you spare my life ; for your sword was at my heart when you shifted its point , and pierced my shoulder ? ”
132218	132300	132304	132305	De Mauleon	597	“ I will tell you , and in so doing , beg you to accept my friendship hereafter , on one condition . In the course of the day , write or dictate a few civil words of apology to M. Hennequin . Ma foi ! every one will praise you for a generosity so becoming in a man who has given such proofs of courage and skill to an avocat who has never handled a sword nor fired a pistol . ”
132359	132363	132365	132366	De Mauleon	597	“ And now , ”
132368	132395	132365	132366	De Mauleon	597	“ now , when he could so easily requite me,—now he will not even take my hand . Is human nature itself at war with me ? ”
132570	132575	132555	132555	He	522	“ Paul Louis Courier , ”
132647	132724	132633	132633	he	522	“ I thought it my duty to call on you , Vicomte , thus early , having already seen M. Enguerrand de Vandemar . He has shown me the copies of the pieces which were inspected by your distinguished kinsmen , and which completely clear you of the charge that — grant me your pardon when I say — seemed to me still to remain unanswered when I had the honour to meet you last night . ”
132725	132753	132620	132621	M. Hennequin	755	“ It appears to me , Monsieur Hennequin , that you , as an avocat so eminent , might have convinced yourself very readily of that fact . ”
132754	132779	132633	132633	he	522	“ Monsieur le Vicomte , I was in Switzerland with my wife at the time of the unfortunate affair in which you were involved . ”
132780	132813	132814	132814	Mauleon	597	“ But when you returned to Paris , you might perhaps have deigned to make inquiries so affecting the honour of one you had called a friend , and for whom you had professed”—De
132820	132824	132817	132817	he	597	add—“an eternal gratitude . ”
132836	132960	132825	132825	Hennequin	750	“ I certainly did inquire . I did hear that the charge against you with regard to the abstraction of the jewels was withdrawn , that you were therefore acquitted by law ; but I heard also that society did not acquit you , and that , finding this , you had quitted France . Pardon me again , no one would listen to me when I attempted to speak on your behalf but now that so many years have elapsed , that the story is imperfectly remembered , that relations so high - placed receive you so cordially,—now I rejoice to think that you will have no difficulty in regaining a social position never really lost , but for a time resigned . ”
132961	133143	133149	133150	De Mauleon	597	“ I am duly sensible of the friendly joy you express . I was reading the other day in a lively author some pleasant remarks on the effects of medisance or calumny upon our impressionable Parisian public . ‘ If , ’ says the writer , ‘ I found myself accused of having put the two towers of Notre Dame into my waistcoat - pocket I should not dream of defending myself ; I should take to flight . And , ’ adds the writer , ‘ if my best friend were under the same accusation , I should be so afraid of being considered his accomplice that I should put my best friend outside the door . ’ Perhaps , Monsieur Hennequin , I was seized with the first alarm . Why should I blame you if seized with the second ? Happily , this good city of Paris has its reactions . And you can now offer me your hand . Paris has by this time discovered that the two towers of Notre Dame are not in my pocket . ”
133238	133242	133243	133243	he	597	“ Forgive me , ”
133250	133305	133243	133243	he	597	“ forgive me , I was to blame . By character , and perhaps by the necessities of my career , I am over - timid to public opinion , public scandal . Forgive me . Say if in anything now I can requite , though but slightly , the service I owe you . ”
133318	133330	133306	133307	De Mauleon	597	“ Would you serve me in turn ? Are you sincere ? ”
133341	133344	133331	133332	The Prefet	4312	“ Yes . ”
133345	133401	133409	133409	Hennequin	750	“ Well , then , what I ask of you is a frank opinion,—not as lawyer , not as Prefet , but as a man who knows the present state of French society . Give that opinion without respect to my feelings one way or other . Let it emanate solely from your practised judgment . ”
133402	133407	133409	133409	Hennequin	750	“ Be it so , ”
133421	133521	133417	133418	De Mauleon	597	“ As you may remember , during my former career I had no political ambition . I did not meddle with politics . In the troubled times that immediately succeeded the fall of Louis Philippe I was but an epicurean looker - on . Grant that , so far as admission to the salons is concerned , I shall encounter no difficulty in regaining position ; but as regards the Chamber , public life , a political career , can I have my fair opening under the Empire ? You pause . Answer as you have promised , frankly . ”
133522	133537	133409	133409	Hennequin	750	“ The difficulties in the way of a political career would be very great . ”
133538	133541	133409	133409	Hennequin	750	“ Insuperable ? ”
133542	133718	133417	133418	De Mauleon	597	“ I fear so . Of course , in my capacity of Prefet , I have no small influence in my department in support of a Government candidate . But I do not think that the Imperial Government could , at this time especially , in which it must be very cautious in selecting its candidates , be induced to recommend you . The affair of the jewels would be raked up ; your vindication disputed , denied ; the fact that for so many years you have acquiesced in that charge without taking steps to refute it ; your antecedents , even apart from that charge ; your present want of property ( M. Enguerrand tells me your income is but moderate ) ; the absence of all previous repute in public life . No ; relinquish the idea of political contest,—it would expose you to inevitable mortifications , to a failure that would even jeopardize the admission to the salons which you are now gaining . You could not be a Government candidate . ”
133719	133742	133409	133409	Hennequin	750	“ Granted . I may have no desire to be one ; but an opposition candidate , one of the Liberal party ? ”
133743	133748	133750	133750	Hennequin	750	“ As an Imperialist , ”
133755	133880	133750	133750	Hennequin	750	“ and holding the office I do , it would not become me to encourage a candidate against the Emperor ’s Government . But speaking with the frankness you solicit , I should say that your chances there are infinitely worse . The Opposition are in a pitiful minority,—the most eminent of the Liberals can scarcely gain seats for themselves ; great local popularity or property , high established repute for established patriotism , or proved talents of oratory and statesmanship , are essential qualifications for a seat in the Opposition ; and even these do not suffice for a third of the persons who possess them . Be again what you were before,—the hero of salons remote from the turbulent vulgarity of politics . ”
133881	133901	133409	133409	Hennequin	750	“ I am answered . Thank you once more . The service I rendered you once is requited now . ”
133902	133950	133417	133418	De Mauleon	597	“ No , indeed,—no ; but will you dine with me quietly today , and allow me to present to you my wife and two children , born since we parted ? I say to - day , for to - morrow I return to my Prefecture . ”
133951	134008	133750	133750	Hennequin	750	“ I am infinitely obliged by your invitation , but to - day I dine with the Comte de Beauvilliers to meet some of the Corps Diplomatique . I must make good my place in the salons , since you so clearly show me that I have no chance of one in the Legislature — unless — ”
134009	134013	133409	133409	Hennequin	750	“ Unless what ? ”
134014	134029	133417	133418	De Mauleon	597	“ Unless there happen one of those revolutions in which the scum comes uppermost . ”
134030	134059	133750	133750	Hennequin	750	“ No fear of that . The subterranean barracks and railway have ended forever the rise of the scum , the reign of the canaille and its barricades . ”
134060	134073	133409	133409	Hennequin	750	“ Adieu , my dear Hennequin . My respectful hommages a Madame . ”

135468	135516	135466	135466	Savarin	431	“ have not the heart of compliment . I am by no means flattered by what he says of my trifles , and I dare say you are still less pleased with this chilly praise of your charming tale ; but the man means to be civil . ”
135517	135520	135522	135522	Isaura	536	“ Certainly , ”
135527	135533	135535	135535	Savarin	431	“ Only think of Rameau ! ”
135537	135678	135535	135535	Savarin	431	“ On the strength of his salary in the ‘ Sens Commun , ’ and on the chateaux en Espagne which he constructs thereon , he has already furnished an apartment in the Chaussee d’Antin , and talks of setting up a coupe in order to maintain the dignity of letters when he goes to dine with the duchesses who are some day or other to invite him . Yet I admire his self - confidence , though I laugh at it . A man gets on by a spring in his own mechanism , and he should always keep it wound up . Rameau will make a figure . I used to pity him ; I begin to respect . Nothing succeeds like success . But I see I am spoiling your morning . Au revoir , mon enfant . ”

145140	145163	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ that was done by a French lady who lodged here many years ago . She drew very prettily , poor thing . ”
145164	145175	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ A lady who lodged here many years ago,—how many ? ”
145176	145185	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ Well , I guess somewhere about twenty . ”
145186	145197	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ Ah , indeed ! Was it a Madame Marigny ? ”
145198	145230	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ Bon Dieu ! That was indeed her name . Did you know her ? I should be so glad to hear she is well and — I hope — happy . ”
145231	145261	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ I do not know where she is now , and am making inquiries to ascertain . Pray help me . How long did Madame Marigny lodge with you ? ”
145262	145283	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ I think pretty well two months ; yes , two months . She left a month after her confinement . ”
145284	145290	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ She was confined here ? ”
145291	145363	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ Yes . When she first came , I had no idea that she was enceinte . She had a pretty figure , and no one would have guessed it , in the way she wore her shawl . Indeed I only began to suspect it a few days before it happened ; and that was so suddenly , that all was happily over before we could send for the accoucheur . ”
145364	145374	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ And the child lived?—a girl or a boy ? ”
145375	145381	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ A girl,—the prettiest baby . ”
145382	145394	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ Did she take the child with her when she went ? ”
145395	145444	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ No ; it was put out to nurse with a niece of my husband who was confined about the same time . Madame paid liberally in advance , and continued to send money half - yearly , till she came herself and took away the little girl . ”
145445	145460	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ When was that,—a little less than five years after she had left it ? ”
145461	145561	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ Why , you know all about it , Monsieur ; yes , not quite five years after . She did not come to see me , which I thought unkind , but she sent me , through my niece - in - law , a real gold watch and a shawl . Poor dear lady — for lady she was all over,—with proud ways , and would not bear to be questioned . But I am sure she was none of your French light ones , but an honest wife like myself , though she never said so . ”
145562	145588	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ And have you no idea where she was all the five years she was away , or where she went after reclaiming her child ? ”
145589	145596	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ No , indeed , Monsieur . ”
145597	145621	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ But her remittances for the infant must have been made by letters , and the letters would have had post - marks ? ”
145622	145658	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ Well , I dare say ; I am no scholar myself . But suppose you see Marie Hubert , that is my niece - in - law , perhaps she has kept the envelopes . ”
145659	145666	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ Where does Madame Hubert live ? ”
145667	145736	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ It is just a league off by the short path ; you ca n’t miss the way . Her husband has a bit of land of his own , but he is also a carrier—‘Max Hubert , carrier,’—written over the door , just opposite the first church you get to . The rain has ceased , but it may be too far for you to - day . ”
145737	145747	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ Not a bit of it . Many thanks . ”
145748	145780	145135	145136	the farmer	4724	“ But if you find out the dear lady and see her , do tell her how pleased I should be to hear good news of her and the little one . ”

145903	145926	146253	146253	his	536	“ But did not Madame Marigny ’s letters ever give you an address to which to write with news of her child ? ”
145927	146025	146253	146253	his	536	“ I do n’t think she cared much for her child , Monsieur . She kissed it very coldly when she came to take it away . I told the poor infant that that was her own mamma ; and Madame said , ‘ Yes , you may call me maman , ’ in a tone of voice — well , not at all like that of a mother . She brought with her a little bag which contained some fine clothes for the child , and was very impatient till the child had got them on . ”
146026	146041	146253	146253	his	536	“ Are you quite sure it was the same lady who left the child ? ”
146042	146090	146253	146253	his	536	“ Oh , there is no doubt of that . She was certainly tres belle , but I did not fancy her as aunt did . She carried her head very high , and looked rather scornful . However , I must say she behaved very generously . ”
146091	146106	146253	146253	his	536	“ Still you have not answered my question whether her letters contained no address . ”
146107	146221	146253	146253	his	536	“ She never wrote more than two letters . One enclosing the first remittance was but a few lines , saying that if the child was well and thriving , I need not write ; but if it died or became dangerously ill , I might at any time write a line to Madame — — - , Poste Restante , Vienna . She was travelling about , but the letter would be sure to reach her sooner or later . The only other letter I had was to apprise me that she was coming to remove the child , and might be expected in three days after the receipt of her letter . ”
146222	146237	146253	146253	his	536	“ And all the other communications from her were merely remittances in blank envelopes ? ”

149187	149205	149175	149175	he	522	“ that you are not dissatisfied with the remuneration your eminent services in the journal have received . ”
149206	149219	149221	149221	Rameau	725	“ The proprietor , whoever he be , has behaved most liberally , ”
149223	149471	149221	149221	Rameau	725	“ I take that compliment to myself , cher confrere ; for though the expenses of starting the Sens Commun , and the caution money lodged , were found by a friend of mine , that was as a loan , which I have long since repaid , and the property in the journal is now exclusively mine . I have to thank you not only for your own brilliant contributions , but for those of the colleagues you secured . Monsieur Savarin ’s piquant criticisms were most valuable to us at starting . I regret to have lost his aid . But as he has set up a new journal of his own , even he has not wit enough to spare for another . A propos of our contributors , I shall ask you to present me to the fair author of The Artist ’s Daughter . I am of too prosaic a nature to appreciate justly the merits of a roman ; but I have heard warm praise of this story from the young — they are the best judges of that kind of literature ; and I can at least understand the worth of a contributor who trebled the sale of our journal . It is a misfortune to us , indeed , that her work is completed , but I trust that the sum sent to her through our publisher suffices to tempt her to favour us with another roman in series . ”
149472	149476	149478	149478	Rameau	725	“ Mademoiselle Cicogna , ”
149490	149539	149478	149478	Rameau	725	“ has accepted for the republication of her roman in a separate form terms which attest the worth of her genius , and has had offers from other journals for a serial tale of even higher amount than the sum so generously sent to her through your publisher . ”
149540	149576	149221	149221	Rameau	725	“ Has she accepted them , Monsieur Rameau ? If so , tant pis pour vous . Pardon me , I mean that your salary suffers in proportion as the Sens Commun declines in sale . ”
149577	149607	149221	149221	Rameau	725	“ She has not accepted them . I advised her not to do so until she could compare them with those offered by the proprietor of the Sens Commun . ”
149608	149643	149221	149221	Rameau	725	“ And your advice guides her ? Ah , cher confrere , you are a happy man!—you have influence over this young aspirant to the fame of a De Stael or a Georges Sand . ”
149644	149653	149655	149655	Rameau	725	“ I flatter myself that I have some , ”
149677	149807	149221	149221	Rameau	725	“ So much the better . I leave you free to arrange terms with Mademoiselle Cicogna , higher than she can obtain elsewhere , and kindly contrive my own personal introduction to her — you have breakfasted already?—permit me to offer you a cigar — excuse me if I do not bear you company ; I seldom smoke — never of a morning . Now to business , and the state of France . Take that easy - chair , seat yourself comfortably . So ! Listen ! If ever Mephistopheles revisit the earth , how he will laugh at Universal Suffrage and Vote by Ballot in an old country like France , as things to be admired by educated men , and adopted by friends of genuine freedom ! ”
149808	149815	149817	149817	Rameau	725	“ I do n’t understand you , ”
149819	149837	149817	149817	Rameau	725	“ In this respect at least , let me hope that I can furnish you with understanding . “
149974	150243	150244	150244	Rameau	725	“ Well , in France there are principles superabundant which you can pit against the principle of Imperial rule . But there is not one name you can pit against Napoleon the Third ; therefore , I steer our little bark in the teeth of the popular gale when I denounce the plebiscite , and Le Sens Commun will necessarily fall in sale — it is beginning to fall already . We shall have the educated men with us , the rest against . In every country — even in China , where all are highly educated — a few must be yet more highly educated than the many . Monsieur Rameau , I desire to overthrow the Empire : in order to do that , it is not enough to have on my side the educated men , I must have the canaille — the canaille of Paris and of the manufacturing towns . But I use the canaille for my purpose — I do n’t mean to enthrone it . You comprehend?—the canaille quiescent is simply mud at the bottom of a stream ; the canaille agitated is mud at the surface . But no man capable of three ideas builds the palaces and senates of civilised society out of mud , be it at the top or the bottom of an ocean . Can either you or I desire that the destinies of France shall be swayed by coxcombical artisans who think themselves superior to every man who writes grammar , and whose idea of a common - wealth is the confiscation of private property ? ”
150260	150291	150253	150253	his	725	“ Proceed . You are against the Empire , yet against the populace!—What are you for ? not , surely , the Legitimists?—are you Republican ? Orleanist ? or what ? ”
150292	150299	150301	150302	the Vicomte	2176	“ Your questions are very pertinent , ”
150306	150432	150301	150302	the Vicomte	2176	“ and my answer shall be very frank . I am against absolute rule , whether under a Buonaparte or a Bourbon . I am for a free State , whether under a constitutional hereditary sovereign like the English or Belgian , or whether , republican in name , it be less democratic than constitutional monarchy in practice , like the American . But as a man interested in the fate of le Sens Commun , I hold in profound disdain all crotchets for revolutionising the elements of Human Nature . Enough of this abstract talk . To the point . You are of course aware of the violent meetings held by the Socialists , nominally against the plebiscite , really against the Emperor himself ? ”
150433	150513	150253	150253	his	725	“ Yes , I know at least that the working class are extremely discontented ; the numerous strikes last month were not on a mere question of wages — they were against the existing forms of society . And the articles by Pierre Firmin which brought me into collision with the Government , seemed to differ from what you now say . They approve those strikes ; they appeared to sympathise with the revolutionary meetings at Belleville and Montmartre . ”
150514	150538	150301	150302	the Vicomte	2176	“ Of course — we use coarse tools for destroying ; we cast them aside for finer ones when we want to reconstruct . “
150706	150758	150688	150691	the commissary of police	4880	“ Sensation among the audience — they gesticulate — they screech — they bellow — the commissary puts on his greatcoat — the secretary gives a last touch to his nails and pockets his penknife — the audience disperses — the silhouette of a man effaces itself — all is over . ”
150759	150767	150769	150769	Rameau	725	“ You describe the scene most wittily , ”
150801	150814	150820	150820	his	597	“ What conclusion do you draw from such a scene , cher poete ”
150827	150837	150820	150820	his	597	“ What conclusion ? Well , that — that — ”
150838	150843	150820	150820	his	597	“ Yes , continue . ”

150890	150960	150820	150820	his	597	“ Spoken like a poet , a French poet . I suppose you admire M. Victor Hugo . Conceding that he would have employed a more sounding phraseology , comprising more absolute ignorance of men , times , and manners in unintelligible metaphor and melodramatic braggadocio , your answer might have been his ; but pardon me if I add , it would not be that of Common Sense . ”
150961	150971	150973	150973	Rameau	725	“ Monsieur le Vicomte might rebuke me more politely , ”
150978	151066	150973	150973	Rameau	725	“ Accept my apologies ; I did not mean to rebuke , but to instruct . The times are not those of 1789 . And Nature , ever repeating herself in the production of coxcombs and blockheads , never repeats herself in the production of Mirabeaus . The Empire is doomed — doomed , because it is hostile to the free play of intellect . Any Government that gives absolute preponderance to the many is hostile to intellect , for intellect is necessarily confined to the few . “
151097	151145	151146	151146	I	0	“ I accept the aid of Pom - de - Tair . I do not demean myself to the extent of writing articles that may favor the principles of Pom - de - Tair , signed in the name of Victor de Mauleon or of Pierre Firinin . “
151363	151410	151361	151361	myself	0	“ Now you have my most secret thoughts . I intrust them to your judgment with entire confidence . Monsieur Lebeau gave you a high character , which you have hitherto deserved . By the way , have you seen anything lately of that bourgeois conspirator ? ”
151411	151436	151595	151596	cher confrere	4896	“ No , his professed business of letter - writer or agent is transferred to a clerk , who says M. Lebeau is abroad . ”
151437	151484	151495	151495	Rameau	725	“ Ah ! I do n’t think that is true . I fancy I saw him the other evening gilding along the lanes of Belleville . He is too confirmed a conspirator to be long out of Paris ; no place like Paris for seething brains . ”
151485	151493	151495	151495	Rameau	725	“ Have you known M. Lebeau long ? ”
151497	151521	151495	151495	Rameau	725	“ Ay , many years . We are both Norman by birth , as you may perceive by something broad in our accent . ”
151522	151543	151595	151596	cher confrere	4896	“ Ha ! I knew your voice was familiar to me ; certainly it does remind me of Lebeau ’s . ”
151544	151591	151495	151495	Rameau	725	“ Normans are like each other in many things besides voice and accent — obstinacy , for instance , in clinging to ideas once formed ; this makes them good friends and steadfast enemies . I would advise no man to make an enemy of Lebeau . “
151608	152572	151605	151606	Mademoiselle Cicogna	481	” On leaving De Mauleon and regaining his coupe , Rameau felt at once bewildered and humbled , for he was not prepared for the tone of careless superiority which the Vicomte assumed over him . He had expected to be much complimented , and he comprehended vaguely that he had been somewhat snubbed . He was not only irritated — he was bewildered ; for De Mauleon ’s political disquisitions did not leave any clear or definite idea on his mind as to the principles which as editor of the Sens Commun he was to see adequately represented and carried out . In truth , Rameau was one of those numerous Parisian politicians who have read little and reflected less on the government of men and States . Envy is said by a great French writer to be the vice of Democracies . Envy certainly had made Rameau a democrat . He could talk and write glibly enough upon the themes of equality and fraternity , and was so far an ultra - democrat that he thought moderation the sign of a mediocre understanding . De Mauleon ’s talk , therefore , terribly perplexed him . It was unlike anything he had heard before . Its revolutionary professions , accompanied with so much scorn for the multitude , and the things the multitude desired , were Greek to him . He was not shocked by the cynicism which placed wisdom in using the passions of mankind as tools for the interests of an individual ; but he did not understand the frankness of its avowal . Nevertheless the man had dominated over and subdued him . He recognized the power of his contributor without clearly analysing its nature — a power made up of large experience of life , of cold examination of doctrines that heated others — of patrician calm — of intellectual sneer — of collected confidence in self . Besides , Rameau felt , with a nervous misgiving , that in this man , who so boldly proclaimed his contempt for the instruments he used , he had found a master . De Mauleon , then , was sole proprietor of the journal from which Rameau drew his resources ; might at any time dismiss him ; might at any time involve the journal in penalties which , even if Rameau could escape in his official capacity as editor , still might stop the Sens Commun , and with it Rameau ’s luxurious subsistence . Altogether the visit to De Mauleon had been anything but a pleasant one . He sought , as the carriage rolled on , to turn his thoughts to more agreeable subjects , and the image of Isaura rose before him . To do him justice he had learned to love this girl as well as his nature would permit : he loved her with the whole strength of his imagination , and though his heart was somewhat cold , his imagination was very ardent . He loved her also with the whole strength of his vanity , and vanity was even a more preponderant organ of his system than imagination . To carry off as his prize one who had already achieved celebrity , whose beauty and fascination of manner were yet more acknowledged than her genius , would certainly be a glorious triumph . Every Parisian of Rameau ’s stamp looks forward in marriage to a brilliant salon . What salon more brilliant than that which he and Isaura united could command ? He had long conquered his early impulse of envy at Isaura ’s success,—in fact that success had become associated with his own , and had contributed greatly to his enrichment . So that to other motives of love he might add the prudential one of interest . Rameau well knew that his own vein of composition , however lauded by the cliques , and however unrivalled in his own eyes , was not one that brings much profit in the market . He compared himself to those poets who are too far in advance of their time to be quite as sure of bread and cheese as they are of immortal fame . But he regarded Isaura ’s genius as of a lower order , and a thing in itself very marketable . Marry her , and the bread and cheese were so certain that he might elaborate as slowly as he pleased the verses destined to immortal fame . Then he should be independent of inferior creatures like Victor de Mauleon . But while Rameau convinced himself that he was passionately in love with Isaura , he could not satisfy himself that she was in love with him . Though during the past year they had seen each other constantly , and their literary occupations had produced many sympathies between them — though he had intimated that many of his most eloquent love - poems were inspired by her — though he had asserted in prose , very pretty prose too , that she was all that youthful poets dream of,—yet she had hitherto treated such declarations with a playful laugh , accepting them as elegant compliments inspired by Parisian gallantry ; and he felt an angry and sore foreboding that if he were to insist too seriously on the earnestness of their import and ask her plainly to be his wife , her refusal would be certain , and his visits to her house might be interdicted . Still Isaura was unmarried , still she had refused offers of marriage from men higher placed than himself,—still he divined no one whom she could prefer . And as he now leaned back in his coupe he muttered to himself , “
152636	153274	152619	152619	She	585	” Here he checked the carriage at a cafe on the Boulevard — descended , imbibed two glasses of absinthe,—and then feeling much emboldened , remounted his coupe and directed the driver to Isaura ’s apartment . Yes , celebrities are of rapid growth in the salons of Paris . Far more solid than that of Rameau , far more brilliant than that of De Mauleon , was the celebrity which Isaura had now acquired . She had been unable to retain the pretty suburban villa at A———. The owner wanted to alter and enlarge it for his own residence , and she had been persuaded by Signora Venosta , who was always sighing for fresh salons to conquer , to remove ( towards the close of the previous year ) to apartments in the centre of the Parisian beau monde . Without formally professing to receive , on one evening in the week her salon was open to those who had eagerly sought her acquaintance — comprising many stars in the world of fashion , as well as those in the world of art and letters . And as she had now wholly abandoned the idea of the profession for which her voice had been cultivated , she no longer shrank from the exercise of her surpassing gift of song for the delight of private friends . Her physician had withdrawn the interdict on such exercise . His skill , aided by the rich vitality of her constitution , had triumphed over all tendencies to the malady for which he had been consulted . To hear Isaura Cicogna sing in her own house was a privilege sought and prized by many who never read a word of her literary compositions . A good critic of a book is rare ; but good judges of a voice are numberless . Adding this attraction of song to her youth , her beauty , her frank powers of converse — an innocent sweetness of manner free from all conventional affectation — and to the fresh novelty of a genius which inspired the young with enthusiast and beguiled the old to indulgence , it was no wonder that Isaura became a celebrity at Paris . Perhaps it was a wonder that her head was not turned by the adulation that surrounded her . But I believe , be it said with diffidence , that a woman of mind so superior that the mind never pretends to efface the heart , is less intoxicated with flattery than a man equally exposed to it . It is the strength of her heart that keeps her head sober . Isaura had never yet overcome her first romance of love ; as yet , amid all her triumphs , there was not a day in which her thoughts did not wistfully , mournfully , fly back to those blessed moments in which she felt her cheek colour before a look , her heart beat at the sound of a footfall . Perhaps if there had been the customary finis to this young romance — the lover ’s deliberate renunciation , his formal farewell — the girl ’s pride would ere this have conquered her affection,—possibly — who knows?—replaced it . But , reader , be you male or female , have you ever known this sore trial of affection and pride , that from some cause or other , to you mysterious , the dear intercourse to which you had accustomed the secret life of your life , abruptly ceases ; you know that a something has come between you and the beloved which you can not distinguish , can not measure , can not guess , and therefore can not surmount ; and you say to yourself at the dead of solitary night , “
153311	153834	152619	152619	She	585	” This trial was Isaura ’s . There had been no explanation , no last farewell between her and Graham . She divined — no woman lightly makes a mistake there — that he loved her ! She knew that this dread something had intervened between her and him when he took leave of her before others so many months ago ; that this dread something still continued — what was it ? She was certain that it would vanish , could they but once meet again and not before others . Oh for such a meeting ! She could not herself destroy hope . She could not marry another . She would have no heart to give to another while he was free , while in doubt if his heart was still her own . And thus her pride did not help her to conquer her affection . Of Graham Vane she heard occasionally . He had ceased to correspond with Savarin ; but among those who most frequented her salon were the Morleys . Americans so well educated and so well placed as the Morleys knew something about every Englishman of the social station of Graham Vane . Isaura learned from them that Graham , after a tour on the Continent , had returned to England at the commencement of the year , had been invited to stand for Parliament , had refused , that his name was in the list published by the Morning Post of the elite whose arrivals in London , or whose presence at dinner - tables , is recorded as an event . That the Athenaeum had mentioned a rumour that Graham Vane was the author of a political pamphlet which , published anonymously , had made no inconsiderable sensation . Isaura sent to England for that pamphlet : the subject was somewhat dry , and the style , though clear and vigorous , was scarcely of the eloquence which wins the admiration of women ; and yet she learned every word of it by heart . We know how little she dreamed that the celebrity which she hailed as an approach to him was daily making her more remote . The sweet labours she undertook for that celebrity continued to be sweetened yet more by secret associations with the absent one . How many of the passages most admired could never have been written had he been never known ! And she blessed those labours the more that they upheld her from the absolute feebleness of sickened reverie , beguiled her from the gnawing torture of unsatisfied conjecture . She did comply with Madame de Grantmesnil ’s command — did pass from the dusty beaten road of life into green fields and along flowery river - banks , and did enjoy that ideal by - world . But still the one image which reigned over her human heart moved beside her in the gardens of fairyland . Isaura was seated in her pretty salon , with the Venosta , M. Savarin , the Morleys , and the financier Louvier , when Rameau was announced . “

154311	154315	154294	154295	Pierre Firmin	759	” asked Louvier ; “

154649	154661	154646	154647	my wife	1392	” Savarin understood that look , and replied to it courteously . “

155077	155083	155070	155070	you	462	” said Isaura , graciously , “

155106	155136	155137	155137	I	0	” Here the Venosta , who had been listening with great attention to Louvier ’s commendation of this investment , drew him aside , and whispered in his ear : “
155166	155167	155140	155141	M. Louvier	399	” “
155209	155210	155212	155212	you	462	” “

155310	155314	155282	155283	the Signorina	478	” said Louvier . “
155349	155457	155342	155342	I	0	” Louvier here turned to address himself to Colonel Morley , but finding that degenerate son of America indisposed to get cent . per cent . for his money when offered by a Parisian , he very soon took his leave . The other visitors followed his example , except Rameau , who was left alone with the Venosta and Isaura . The former had no liking for Rameau , who showed her none of the attentions her innocent vanity demanded , and she soon took herself off to her own room to calculate the amount of her savings , and dream of the Rue de Louvier and “
155461	155602	155342	155342	I	0	” Rameau approaching his chair to Isaura ’s then commenced conversation , drily enough , upon pecuniary matters ; acquitting himself of the mission with which De Mauleon had charged him , the request for a new work from her pen for the Sens Commun , and the terms that ought to be asked for compliance . The young lady - author shrank from this talk . Her private income , though modest , sufficed for her wants , and she felt a sensitive shame in the sale of her thoughts and fancies . Putting hurriedly aside the mercantile aspect of the question , she said that she had no other work in her mind at present — that , whatever her vein of invention might be , it flowed at its own will , and could not be commanded . “
155605	155609	155342	155342	I	0	” said Rameau , “
155694	155695	155683	155683	I	0	” “
155721	155722	155723	155723	I	0	” “

155890	155897	155878	155878	I	0	” This was said very dejectedly . “
155954	155999	156019	156019	they	4966	” Isaura was silent , her head drooped on her breast — there were tears in her downcast eyes . Rameau took her hand , which she yielded to him passively , and clasping it in both his own , he rushed on impulsively — “
156051	156064	156101	156101	Signorina	478	” Isaura ’s breast heaved beneath her robe , she sighed softly . “
156213	156434	156437	156437	another	1260	” They say the woman who hesitates is lost . Isaura hesitated , but was not yet lost . The words she listened to moved her deeply . Offers of marriage she had already received : one from a rich middle - aged noble , a devoted musical virtuoso ; one from a young avocat fresh from the provinces , and somewhat calculating on her dot ; one from a timid but enthusiastic admirer of her genius and her beauty , himself rich , handsome , of good birth , but with shy manners and faltering tongue . But these had made their proposals with the formal respect habitual to French decorum in matrimonial proposals . Words so eloquently impassioned as Gustave Rameau ’s had never before thrilled her ears ; Yes , she was deeply moved ; and yet , by that very emotion she knew that it was not to the love of this wooer that her heart responded . There is a circumstance in the history of courtship familiar to the experience of many women , that while the suitor is pleading his cause , his language may touch every fibre in the heart of his listener , yet substitute , as it were , another presence for his own . She may be saying to herself , “
156443	156493	156437	156437	another	1260	” and be dreaming of the other , while she hears the one . Thus it was with Isaura , and not till Rameau ’s voice had ceased did that dream pass away , and with a slight shiver she turned her face towards the wooer sadly and pityingly . “
156499	156508	156437	156437	another	1260	” she said , in a low whisper ; “
156569	156570	156561	156561	I	0	” “
156576	156589	156572	156572	I	0	” said Rameau , coldly , for his amour propre was resentful , “
156602	156617	156572	156572	I	0	” And he named the youngest and comeliest of those whom she had rejected . “
156621	157101	156572	156572	I	0	” said Isaura . Rameau rose and went to the window , turning his face from her . In reality he was striving to collect his thoughts and decide on the course it were most prudent for him now to pursue . The fumes of the absinthe which had , despite his previous forebodings , emboldened him to hazard his avowal , had now subsided into the languid reaction which is generally consequent on that treacherous stimulus , a reaction not unfavourable to passionless reflection . He knew that if he said he could not conquer his love , he would still cling to hope , and trust to perseverance and time , he should compel Isaura to forbid his visits and break off their familiar intercourse . This would be fatal to the chance of yet winning her , and would also be of serious disadvantage to his more worldly interests . Her literary aid might become essential to the journal on which his fortunes depended ; and at all events , in her conversation , in her encouragement , in her sympathy with the pains and joys of his career , he felt a support , a comfort , nay , an inspiration . For the spontaneous gush of her fresh thoughts and fancies served to recruit his own jaded ideas , and enlarge his own stinted range of invention . No , he could not commit himself to the risk of banishment from Isaura . And mingled with meaner motives for discretion , there was one of which he was but vaguely conscious , purer and nobler . In the society of this girl , in whom whatever was strong and high in mental organisation became so sweetened into feminine grace by gentleness of temper and kindliness of disposition , Rameau felt himself a better man . The virgin - like dignity with which she moved , so untainted by a breath of scandal , amid salons in which the envy of virtues doubted sought to bring innocence itself into doubt , warmed into a genuine reverence the cynicism of his professed creed . While with her , while under her chastening influence , he was sensible of a poetry infused within him far more true to the Camoenae than all he had elaborated into verse . In these moments he was ashamed of the vices he had courted as distractions . He imagined that with her all his own , it would be easy to reform . No ; to withdraw wholly from Isaura was to renounce his sole chance of redemption . While these thoughts , which it takes so long to detail , passed rapidly through his brain , he felt a soft touch on his arm , and , turning his face slowly , encountered the tender , compassionate eyes of Isaura . “
157108	157122	156572	156572	I	0	” she said , with a smile , half cheering , half mournful . “
157135	157136	157137	157137	I	0	” “
157144	157148	157137	157137	I	0	” answered Rameau ; “
157220	157221	157212	157212	You	4978	” “
157236	157441	157234	157234	friends	1591	” She held out her hand as she spoke ; he bent over it , kissed it with respect , and the interview thus closed . It was late in the evening that day when a man who had the appearance of a decent bourgeois , in the lower grades of that comprehensive class , entered one of the streets in the Faubourg Montmartre , tenanted chiefly by artisans . He paused at the open doorway of a tall narrow house , and drew back as he heard footsteps descending a very gloomy staircase . The light from a gas lamp on the street fell full on the face of the person thus quitting the house — the face of a young and handsome man , dressed with the quiet elegance which betokened one of higher rank or fashion than that neighbourhood was habituated to find among its visitors . The first comer retreated promptly into the shade , and , as by sudden impulse , drew his hat low down over his eyes . The other man did not , however , observe him , went his way with a quick step along the street , and entered another house some yards distant . “
157450	157456	157458	157458	he	797	” muttered the first comer . “
157475	157616	157470	157470	Erebus	389	” Taking cautious hold of the banister , the man now ascended the stairs . On the landing of the first floor there was a gas lamp which threw upward a faint ray that finally died at the third story . But at that third story the man ’s journey ended ; he pulled a bell at the door to the right , and in another moment or so the door was opened by a young woman of twenty - eight or thirty , dressed very simply , but with a certain neatness not often seen in the wives of artisans in the Faubourg Montmartre . Her face , which , though pale and delicate , retained much of the beauty of youth , became clouded as she recognised the visitor ; evidently the visit was not welcome to her . “
157621	157628	157470	157470	Erebus	389	” she exclaimed , shrinking back . “
157652	158010	157646	157646	I	0	” and sliding by the woman , M. Lebeau passed the narrow lobby in which she stood , through the open door conducting into the room in which Armand Monnier was seated , his chin propped on his hand , his elbow resting on a table , looking abstractedly into space . In a corner of the room two small children were playing languidly with a set of bone tablets , inscribed with the letters of the alphabet . But whatever the children were doing with the alphabet , they were certainly not learning to read from it . The room was of fair size and height , and by no means barely or shabbily furnished . There was a pretty clock on the mantelpiece . On the wall were hung designs for the decoration of apartments , and shelves on which were ranged a few books . The window was open , and on the sill were placed flowerpots ; you could scent the odour they wafted into the room . Altogether it was an apartment suited to a skilled artisan earning high wages . From the room we are now in , branched on one side a small but commodious kitchen ; on the other side , on which the door was screened by a portiere , with a border prettily worked by female hands — some years ago , for it was faded now — was a bedroom , communicating with one of less size in which the children slept . We do not enter those additional rooms , but it may be well here to mention them as indications of the comfortable state of an intelligent skilled artisan of Paris , who thinks he can better that state by some revolution which may ruin his employer . Monnier started up at the entrance of Lebeau , and his face showed that he did not share the dislike to the visit which that of the female partner of his life had evinced . On the contrary , his smile was cordial , and there was a hearty ring in the voice which cried out — “
158024	158025	158106	158106	Monnier	650	” “
158036	158037	158038	158038	I	0	” “
158049	158050	158051	158052	O Armand	798	” “
158060	158067	158051	158052	O Armand	798	” cried the woman , piteously . “
158079	158105	158106	158106	Monnier	650	” as she faltered forth the last words , she bowed her head over the two little ones , and her voice died in sobs . “
158108	158114	158106	158106	Monnier	650	” said Lebeau , gravely , “
158143	158144	158106	158106	Monnier	650	” “
158150	158154	158106	158106	Monnier	650	” interrupted Monnier . “
158157	158203	158106	158106	Monnier	650	” He approached the woman and took up one of the children very tenderly , stroking back its curls and kissing the face , which , if before surprised and saddened by the mother ’s sob , now smiled gaily under the father ’s kiss . “
158211	158218	158106	158106	Monnier	650	” said the artisan , mildly , “
158265	158334	158335	158335	You	4998	” The poor woman made no reply , but as he drew her towards him , she leant her head upon his breast and wept quietly . Monnier led her thus from the room , whispering words of soothing . The children followed the parents into the adjoining chamber . In a few minutes Monnier returned , shutting the door behind him , and drawing the portiere close . “
158367	158368	158369	158369	I	0	” “
158380	158390	158375	158375	her	453	” said Lebeau , with a somewhat melancholy smile . “

158750	158756	158745	158745	him	415	” cried Monnier , fiercely . “

159583	159602	159577	159577	You	0	” cried Monnier ; and he seized Lebeau ’s hand , and shook it with warmth and vigour . “

159915	159923	159911	159913	Poor young man	5069	” said Lebeau , readjusting his spectacles , “

160133	160139	160127	160127	I	0	” said Monnier , stoutly . “

160159	160165	160154	160154	I	0	” resumed Lebeau , calmly . “

160472	160508	160509	160510	Armand Monnier	650	” Lebeau leisurely took up his hat and drew on his gloves — then , as if struck by a sudden thought , he turned briskly on the artisan and said in quick blunt tones : “
160603	160604	160605	160605	You	650	” “
160611	160634	160605	160605	You	650	” said Monnier , with an ingenuous laugh , that brightened up features stern and hard , though comely when in repose . “
160710	160711	160685	160685	you	650	” “
160714	160715	160685	160685	you	650	” “
160890	160935	160936	160936	Monnier	650	” Lebeau , leaning against the door , heard the frank avowal he had courted without betraying a change of countenance . But when Armand Monnier had done , a slight movement of his lips showed emotion ; was it of fear or disdain ? “
160938	160944	160936	160936	Monnier	650	” he said , gently ; “
161031	161277	161278	161283	un jeune homme plein de moyens	5108	” Isaura ’s apartment , on the following Thursday evening , was more filled than usual . Besides her habitual devotees in the artistic or literary world , there were diplomatists and deputies commixed with many fair chiefs of la jeunesse doree ; amongst the latter the brilliant Enguerrand de Vandemar , who , deeming the acquaintance of every celebrity essential to his own celebrity in either Carthage , the beau monde , or the demi - monde , had , two Thursdays before , made Louvier attend her soiree and present him . Louvier , though gathering to his own salons authors and artists , very rarely favoured their rooms with his presence ; he did not adorn Isaura ’s party that evening . But Duplessis was there , in compensation . It had chanced that Valerie had met Isaura at some house in the past winter , and conceived an enthusiastic affection for her : since then , Valerie came very often to see her , and made a point of dragging with her to Isaura ’s Thursday reunions her obedient father . Soirees , musical or literary , were not much in his line ; but he had no pleasure like that of pleasing his spoilt child . Our old friend Frederic Lemercier was also one of Isaura ’s guests that night . He had become more and more intimate with Duplessis , and Duplessis had introduced him to the fair Valerie as “
161289	161385	161278	161283	un jeune homme plein de moyens	5108	” Savarin was there of course , and brought with him an English gentleman of the name of Bevil , as well known at Paris as in London — invited everywhere — popular everywhere,—one of those welcome contributors to the luxuries of civilised society who trade in gossip , sparing no pains to get the pick of it , and exchanging it liberally sometimes for a haunch of venison , sometimes for a cup of tea . His gossip not being adulterated with malice was in high repute for genuine worth . If Bevil said , “
161392	161409	161278	161283	un jeune homme plein de moyens	5108	” you no more thought of doubting him than you would doubt Rothschild if he said , “
161417	161665	161666	161666	I	0	” Mr. Bevil was at present on a very short stay at Paris , and , naturally wishing to make the most of his time , he did not tarry beside Savarin , but , after being introduced to Isaura , flitted here and there through the assembly . The bee proffers honey , but bears a sting . The room was at its fullest when Gustave Rameau entered , accompanied by Monsieur de Mauleon . Isaura was agreeably surprised by the impression made on her by the Vicomte ’s appearance and manner . His writings , and such as she had heard of his earlier repute , had prepared her to see a man decidedly old , of withered aspect and sardonic smile — aggressive in demeanour — forward or contemptuous in his very politeness — a Mephistopheles engrafted on the stem of a Don Juan . She was startled by the sight of one who , despite his forty - eight years — and at Paris a man is generally older at forty - eight than he is elsewhere — seemed in the zenith of ripened manhood — startled yet more by the singular modesty of a deportment too thoroughly high - bred not to be quietly simple — startled most by a melancholy expression in eyes that could be at times soft , though always so keen , and in the grave pathetic smile which seemed to disarm censure of past faults in saying , “
161671	161977	161978	161979	My cousin	1391	” He did not follow up his introduction to his young hostess by any of the insipid phrases of compliment to which she was accustomed ; but , after expressing in grateful terms his thanks for the honour she had permitted Rameau to confer on him , he moved aside , as if he had no right to detain her from other guests more worthy her notice , towards the doorway , taking his place by Enguerrand amidst a group of men of whom Duplessis was the central figure . At that time — the first week in May , 1870 — all who were then in Paris will remember that there were two subjects uppermost in the mouths of men : first , the plebiscite ; secondly , the conspiracy to murder the Emperor — which the disaffected considered to be a mere fable , a pretence got up in time to serve the plebiscite and prop the Empire . Upon this latter subject Duplessis had been expressing himself with unwonted animation . A loyal and earnest Imperialist , it was only with effort that he could repress his scorn of that meanest sort of gossip which is fond of ascribing petty motives to eminent men . To him nothing could be more clearly evident than the reality of this conspiracy , and he had no tolerance for the malignant absurdity of maintaining that the Emperor or his Ministers could be silly and wicked enough to accuse seventy - two persons of a crime which the police had been instructed to invent . As De Mauleon approached , the financier brought his speech to an abrupt close . He knew in the Vicomte de Mauleon the writer of articles which had endangered the Government , and aimed no pointless shafts against its Imperial head . “
161981	161999	161978	161979	My cousin	1391	” said Enguerrand , gaily , as he exchanged a cordial shake of the hand with Victor , “
162103	162104	162105	162106	Tres bien	5115	” “
162108	162118	162105	162106	Tres bien	5115	” said Duplessis , in Parliamentary tone and phrase . “
162121	162131	162133	162133	you	1391	” said De Mauleon , with his calm smile , “
162193	162194	162195	162195	Monsieur	5122	” “
162197	162201	162195	162195	Monsieur	5122	” said Duplessis , “
162328	162336	162339	162339	you	5122	” The Vicomte bowed as in assent . “
162342	162348	162339	162339	you	5122	” asked a Liberal Depute , “
162369	162412	162339	162339	you	5122	” Duplessis looked keenly at De Mauleon while this question was put to him . Belief or disbelief in the conspiracy was with him , and with many , the test by which a sanguinary revolutionist was distinguished from an honest politician . “
162416	162425	162339	162339	you	5122	” answered De Mauleon , shrugging his shoulders , “
162556	162570	162554	162554	you	5145	Enguerrand,”—and taking his kinsman ’s arm he drew him aside from the circle . “
162585	162586	162578	162578	I	0	” “
162591	162611	162614	162614	himself	5062	” answered Enguerrand , throwing himself on a couch in a recess , and making room for De Mauleon beside him—“Raoul
162744	162745	162750	162750	he	5062	” “
162767	162782	162783	162784	Poor Raoul!—and	808	” said De Mauleon , with a smile in which sarcasm disappeared in melancholy . “
162860	162861	162853	162853	him	5062	” “
162878	162879	162864	162864	you	0	” “

163329	163335	163326	163326	I	0	” said Enguerrand , reluctantly , “

163566	163622	163562	163562	Alain	351	” Enguerrand , who certainly was so far a born Parisian that with all his shrewdness and savoir faire , he had a wonderfully sympathetic heart , very easily moved , one way or the other — Enguerrand winced at his elder kinsman ’s words complimentarily reproachful , and said in unwonted tones of humility : “
163801	163802	163795	163795	I	0	” “
163807	163808	163795	163795	I	0	” “

164050	164251	164036	164037	the Cicogna	454	” Madame S————- , who , since she had learned that there was no cause to apprehend that Isaura might become her professional rival , conceived for her a wonderful affection , and willingly contributed her magnificent gifts of song to the charms of Isaura ’s salon , now began a fragment from I Puritani , which held the audience as silent as the ghosts listening to Sappho , and when it was over , several of the guests slipped away , especially those who disliked music , and feared Madame S————- might begin again . Enguerrand was not one of such soulless recreants , but he had many other places to go to . Besides , Madame S — — — — was no novelty to him . De Mauleon now approached Isaura , who was seated next to Valerie , and after well - merited encomium on Madame S———‘s performance , slid into some critical comparisons between that singer and those of a former generation , which interested Isaura , and evinced to her quick perceptions that kind of love for music which has been refined by more knowledge of the art than is common to mere amateurs . “
164261	164265	164252	164252	You	5217	” she said . “
164272	164273	164274	164274	I	0	” “

164393	164406	164407	164407	you	5217	” cried Valerie , with a pretty brusquerie which became her well , “
164413	164414	164410	164411	a Vandal	5219	” “
164442	164443	164435	164436	your father	8236	” “

164534	164543	164550	164550	they	5224	” Here Duplessis came up and whispered his daughter “
164567	164594	164550	164550	they	5224	” Valerie took her father ’s arm with a brightening smile and a heightened colour . Alain de Rochebriant might probably be at the Duchesse ’s . “
164610	164614	164606	164608	M. de Mauleon	578	” asked Duplessis . “
164650	164763	164624	164625	The Duchesse	2775	” Duplessis frowned , and hastily led Valerie away . In a few minutes the room was comparatively deserted . De Mauleon , however , lingered by the side of Isaura till all the other guests were gone . Even then he lingered still , and renewed the interrupted conversation with her , the Venosta joining therein ; and so agreeable did he make himself to her Italian tastes by a sort of bitter - sweet wisdom like that of her native proverbs — comprising much knowledge of mankind on the unflattering side of humanity in that form of pleasantry which has a latent sentiment of pathos — that the Venosta exclaimed , “
164774	165022	164765	164765	you	0	” There was that in De Mauleon ’s talk hostile to all which we call romance that excited the imagination of Isaura , and compelled her instinctive love for whatever is more sweet , more beautiful , more ennobling on the many sides of human life , to oppose what she deemed the paradoxes of a man who had taught himself to belie even his own nature . She became eloquent , and her countenance , which in ordinary moments owed much of its beauty to an expression of meditative gentleness , was now lighted up by the energy of earnest conviction — the enthusiasm of an impassioned zeal . Gradually De Mauleon relaxed his share in the dialogue , and listened to her , rapt and dreamily as in his fiery youth he had listened to the songs of the sirens . No siren Isaura ! She was defending her own cause , though unconsciously — defending the vocation of art as the embellisher of external nature , and more than embellisher of the nature which dwells crude , but plastic in the soul of man : indeed therein the creator of a new nature , strengthened , expanded , and brightened in proportion as it accumulates the ideas that tend beyond the boundaries of the visible and material nature , which is finite ; for ever seeking in the unseen and the spiritual the goals in the infinite which it is their instinct to divine . “
165030	165034	164765	164765	you	0	” said Isaura , “
165066	165067	164624	164625	The Duchesse	2775	” “

165206	165207	165261	165263	the Signora Venosta	430	” “
165212	165222	165261	165263	the Signora Venosta	430	” said De Mauleon , rising to take leave , “
165299	165300	165261	165263	the Signora Venosta	430	” “
165307	165317	165318	165318	you	5229	” said the Venosta , with Florentine politeness , — “
165325	165326	165261	165263	the Signora Venosta	430	” “
165345	165378	165379	165380	Poor girl	3189	” answered De Mauleon , in another paraphrase of Italian proverb , and he was gone . As he walked homeward , through deserted streets , Victor de Mauleon thought to himself , “
165464	165670	165439	165443	the best and the cleverest	5243	” Then he paused , and in a moment or so afterwards his thought knew such questionings no more . It turned upon personalities , on stratagems and plots , on ambition . The man had more than his share of that peculiar susceptibility which is one of the characteristics of his countrymen — susceptibility to immediate impulse — susceptibility to fleeting impressions . It was a key to many mysteries in his character when he owned his subjection to the influence of music , and in music recognised not the seraph ’s harp , but the siren ’s song . If you could have permanently fixed Victor de Mauleon in one of the good moments of his life — even now — some moment of exquisite kindness — of superb generosity — of dauntless courage — you would have secured a very rare specimen of noble humanity . But so to fix him was impossible . That impulse of the moment vanished the moment after ; swept aside by the force of his very talents — talents concentrated by his intense sense of individuality — sense of wrongs or of rights — interests or objects personal to himself . He extended the royal saying , “
165676	165683	165439	165443	the best and the cleverest	5243	” to words far more grandiloquent . “
165690	165711	165712	165712	I	0	” The Venosta would have understood him and smiled approvingly , if he had said with good - humoured laugh , “
165720	165929	166154	166154	Confrere	788	” That is an Italian proverb , and means much the same thing . On the 8th of May the vote of the plebiscite was recorded,—between seven and eight millions of Frenchmen in support of the Imperial programme — in plain words , of the Emperor himself — against a minority of 1,500,000 . But among the 1,500,000 were the old throne - shakers - those who compose and those who lead the mob of Paris . On the 14th , as Rameau was about to quit the editorial bureau of his printing - office , a note was brought in to him which strongly excited his nervous system . It contained a request to see him forthwith , signed by those two distinguished foreign members of the Secret Council of Ten , Thaddeus Loubinsky and Leonardo Raselli . The meetings of that Council had been so long suspended that Rameau had almost forgotten its existence . He gave orders to admit the conspirators . The two men entered , the Pole , tall , stalwart , and with martial stride — the Italian , small , emaciated , with skulking , noiseless , cat - like step , both looking wondrous threadbare , and in that state called “
165933	165993	166154	166154	Confrere	788	” which belongs to the man who can not work for his livelihood , and assumes a superiority over the man who can . Their outward appearance was in notable discord with that of the poet - politician — he all new in the last fashions of Parisian elegance , and redolent of Parisian prosperity and extrait de Mousseline ! “
165996	166047	166154	166154	Confrere	788	” said the Pole , seating himself on the edge of the table , while the Italian leaned against the mantelpiece , and glanced round the room with furtive eye , as if to detect its innermost secrets , or decide where safest to drop a Lucifer - match for its conflagration,—“confrere
166049	166054	166154	166154	Confrere	788	” said the Pole , “
166060	166061	166154	166154	Confrere	788	” “
166069	166073	166154	166154	Confrere	788	” interposed the Italian softly,—“Humanity
166075	166076	166154	166154	Confrere	788	” “
166089	166153	166154	166154	Confrere	788	” said Rameau ; and rising , he went to the door , opened it , looked forth , ascertained that the coast was clear , then reclosed the door as cautiously as a prudent man closes his pocket whenever shabby - genteel visitors appeal to him in the cause of his country , still more if they appeal in that of Humanity . “
166156	166161	166154	166154	Confrere	788	” said the Pole , “
166179	166180	166154	166154	Confrere	788	” “
166184	166191	166154	166154	Confrere	788	” again softly interposed the Italian . “
166197	166202	166154	166154	Confrere	788	” said the Pole . “
166206	166210	166204	166204	me	0	” said Rameau , “
166287	166288	166289	166290	The Council	10904	” “
166301	166305	166289	166290	The Council	10904	” replied Thaddeus . “
166310	166318	166320	166320	you	5251	” here the Pole raised his voice , “
166331	166332	166320	166320	you	5251	” “
166341	166347	166335	166339	dear but too vehement confrere	5261	” murmured the bland Italian ; “
166359	166384	166349	166349	me	0	” and he took out of his breast - pocket a paper which he presented to Rameau ; on it were written these words : “
166424	166452	166414	166414	He	5264	” No name was appended to this instruction , but a cipher intelligible to all members of the Council as significant of its president , Jean Lebeau . “
166458	166463	166454	166454	I	0	” said the Italian , “
166471	166586	166464	166465	Citizen Rameau	799	” Rameau paused . The penalties for disobedience to an order of the President of the Council were too formidable to be disregarded . There could be no doubt that,—though his name was not mentioned , he , Rameau , was accurately designated as the youngest member of the Council . Still , however he might have owed his present position to the recommendation of Lebeau , there was nothing in the conversation of M. de Mauleon which would warrant participation in a popular emeute by the editor of a journal belonging to that mocker of the mob . Ah ! but — and here again he glanced over the paper — he was asked “
166595	166627	166464	166465	Citizen Rameau	799	” To observe was the duty of a journalist . He might go to the demonstration as De Mauleon confessed he had gone to the Communist Club , a philosophical spectator . “
166635	166644	166628	166628	You	5266	” said the Pole , crossing his arms . “
166657	166663	166645	166645	I	0	” answered Rameau , drily , “
166670	166671	166664	166664	I	0	” “
166674	166679	166680	166680	I	0	” said the Pole ; “
166714	166715	166690	166690	you	5266	” “
166731	166739	166690	166690	you	5266	” put in the Italian , whispering . “
166752	166756	166758	166758	I	0	” answered Rameau ; “
166802	166803	166781	166781	you	5266	” “
166807	166812	166781	166781	you	5266	” said the Italian , “
166820	166836	166781	166781	you	5266	” Here , with a bow and a smile , he glided towards the door . “
166839	166846	166781	166781	you	5266	” muttered the Pole , lingering , “
166882	166925	166932	166933	the tyrant	10879	” Rameau , too thoroughly Parisian not to be as lavish of his own money as he was envious of another ’s , slipped some pieces of gold in the Pole ’s hand . The Pole ’s bosom heaved with manly emotion : “
166948	166949	166935	166935	I	0	” “
166963	166999	166953	166954	Signor Raselli	815	” whispered Rameau , with a smile he might have plagiarised from De Mauleon . The Italian , whose ear was inured to whispers , heard and turned round as he stood at the threshold . “
167039	167081	166953	166954	Signor Raselli	815	” An hour or so later , Rameau was driven in his comfortable coupe to the Faubourg du Temple . Suddenly , at the angle of a street , his coachman was stopped — a rough - looking man appeared at the door—__"Descends
167089	167148	166953	166954	Signor Raselli	815	” Behind the rough - looking man were menacing faces . Rameau was not physically a coward — very few Frenchmen are , still fewer Parisians ; and still fewer no matter what their birthplace , the men whom we call vain — the men who over - much covet distinction , and over - much dread reproach . “
167157	167163	167151	167151	I	0	” said Rameau , haughtily . “
167171	167192	167166	167166	Coachman	1460	” The rough - looking man opened the door , and silently extended a hand to Rameau , saying gently : “
167223	167235	167236	167236	He	5283	” While this man spoke others gesticulated ; some shrieked out , “
167250	167276	167241	167241	he	5283	” Some leader of the crowd — a Parisian crowd always has a classical leader , who has never read the classics — thundered forth , “
167285	167291	167241	167241	he	5283	” Therewith came a yell , “
167298	167368	167241	167241	he	5283	” We Anglo - Saxons , of the old country or the new , are not familiarised to the dread roar of a populace delighted to have a Roman authority for tearing us to pieces ; still Americans know what is Lynch law . Rameau was in danger of Lynch law , when suddenly a face not unknown to him interposed between himself and the rough - looking man . “
167371	167377	167378	167380	my young confrere	5287	” cried this new comer , “
167417	167426	167413	167413	you	5288	” Then in a low voice to Rameau , “
167459	167572	167573	167574	Honest fellow	5291	” Rameau then , seeking to drape himself in majesty,—as the aristocrats of journalism in a city wherein no other aristocracy is recognised naturally and commendably do , when ignorance combined with physical strength asserts itself to be a power , beside which the power of knowledge is what a learned poodle is to a tiger — Rameau then descended from his coupe , and said to this Titan of labour , as a French marquis might have said to his valet , and as , when the French marquis has become a ghost of the past , the man who keeps a coupe says to the man who mends its wheels , “
167580	167975	167976	167976	men	8516	” Monnier led the journalist through the mob to the rear of the barricade hastily constructed . Here were assembled very motley groups . The majority were ragged boys , the gamins of Paris , commingled with several women of no reputable appearance , some dingily , some gaudily apparelled . The crowd did not appear as if the business in hand was a very serious one . Amidst the din of voices the sounds of laughter rose predominant , jests and bon mots flew from lip to lip . The astonishing good - humour of the Parisians was not yet excited into the ferocity that grows out of it by a street contest . It was less like a popular emeute than a gathering of schoolboys , bent not less on fun than on mischief . But , still , amid this gayer crowd were sinister , lowering faces ; the fiercest were not those of the very poor , but rather of artisans , who , to judge by their dress , seemed well off of men belonging to yet higher grades . Rameau distinguished amongst these the medecin des pauvres , the philosophical atheist , sundry young , long - haired artists , middle aged writers for the Republican press , in close neighbourhood with ruffians of villainous aspect , who might have been newly returned from the galleys . None were regularly armed ; still revolvers and muskets and long knives were by no means unfrequently interspersed among the rioters . The whole scene was to Rameau a confused panorama , and the dissonant tumult of yells and laughter , of menace and joke , began rapidly to act on his impressionable nerves . He felt that which is the prevalent character of a Parisian riot — the intoxication of an impulsive sympathy ; coming there as a reluctant spectator , if action commenced he would have been borne readily into the thick of the action — he could not have helped it ; already he grew impatient of the suspense of strife . Monnier having deposited him safely with his back to a wall , at the corner of a street handy for flight , if flight became expedient , had left him for several minutes , having business elsewhere . Suddenly the whisper of the Italian stole into his ear—“These
168010	168011	168014	168014	you	0	” “
168017	168018	168014	168014	you	0	” “
168026	168033	168019	168019	I	0	” whispered the Friend of humanity ; “
168087	168113	168114	168114	Brother	819	” Before Rameau could answer , Monnier rejoined him . The artisan ’s face was overcast — his lips compressed , yet quivering with indignation . “
168116	168122	168114	168114	Brother	819	” he said to Rameau , “
168129	168139	168114	168114	Brother	819	betrayed”—(the word trahi was just then coming into vogue at Paris)—“the
168218	168242	168336	168336	Hist	5303	” and he thrust a revolver into Rameau ’s hand . Then with a lusty voice that rang through the crowd , he shouted “
168247	168264	168336	168336	Hist	5303	” The rioters caught and re - echoed the cry , mingled with other cries , ’ “
168269	168270	168336	168336	Hist	5303	” “
168276	168307	168336	168336	Hist	5303	” The shouts were yet at their full when a strong hand grasped Monnier ’s arm , and a clear , deep , but low voice thrilled through his ear : “
168394	168419	168422	168422	me	0	” The same strong hand quitting its hold on Monnier , then seized Rameau by the wrist , and the same deep voice said , “
168424	168511	168512	168513	The soldiers	5301	” Rameau , turning in amaze , not unmixed with anger , saw beside him a tall man with sombrero hat pressed close over his head , and in the blouse of a labourer , but through such disguise he recognized the pale grey whiskers and green spectacles of Lebeau . He yielded passively to the grasp that led him away down the deserted street at the angle . At the further end of that street , however , was heard the steady thud of hoofs . “
168522	168528	168512	168513	The soldiers	5301	” said Lebeau , calmly ; “
168540	168585	168512	168513	The soldiers	5301	” and he plunged into a dismal court , then into a labyrinth of lanes , followed mechanically by Rameau . They issued at last on the Boulevards , in which the usual loungers were quietly sauntering , wholly unconscious of the riot elsewhere . “
168615	168713	168607	168608	your MS	5314	” Lebeau here quitted him . Meanwhile all happened as Lebeau had predicted . The sergens de ville showed themselves in front of the barricades , a small troop of mounted soldiers appeared in the rear . The mob greeted the first with yells and a shower of stones ; at the sight of the last they fled in all directions ; and the sergens de ville , calmly scaling the barricades , carried off in triumph , as prisoners of war , 4 gamins , 3 women , and 1 Irishman loudly protesting innocence , and shrieking “
168716	168751	168714	168714	Murther	820	” So ended the first inglorious rise against the plebiscite and the Empire , on the 14th of May , 1870 . From Isaura Cicogna to Madame de Grantmesnil . Saturday . May 21 . “
169014	169075	169076	169076	You	5330	“ In the chorus of acclamation amidst which the Emperor entered the hall , it seemed as if one heard the voice of the France he had just appealed to . If the Fates are really weaving woe and shame in his woof , it is in hues which , to mortal eyes , seem brilliant with glory and joy . “
169134	169245	169110	169110	I	0	“ ‘ It is now , ’ said the President , ‘ eighteen years since France , wearied with confusion , and anxious for security , confiding in your genuis and the Napoleonic dynasty , placed in your hands , together with the Imperial Crown , the authority which the public necessity demanded . ’ Then the address proceeded to enumerate the blessings that ensued — social order speedily restored — the welfare of all classes of society promoted — advances in commerce and manufactures to an extent hitherto unknown . Is not this true ? and , if so , are you , noble daughter of France , ungrateful ? “
169553	169667	169668	169668	I	0	“ All eyes now fixed on the Emperor , and I noticed few eyes which were not moist with tears . You know that calm unrevealing face of his — a face which sometimes disappoints expectation . But there is that in it which I have seen in no other , but which I can imagine to have been common to the Romans of old , the dignity that arises from self - control — an expression which seems removed from the elation of joy , the depression of sorrow — not unbecoming to one who has known great vicissitudes of Fortune , and is prepared alike for her frowns or her smiles . “
169922	169994	170020	170021	the Emperor	8285	“ Oh , dear Eulalie , how I am digressing ! The Emperor spoke — and believe me , Eulalie , whatever the journals or your compatriots may insinuate , there is in that man no sign of declining intellect or failing health . I care not what may be his years , but that man is in mind and in health as young as Caesar when he crossed the Rubicon . “
170066	170112	170114	170114	he	8285	“ ‘ We must more than ever look fearlessly forward to the future . Who can be opposed to the progressive march of a regime founded by a great people in the midst of political disturbance , and which now is fortified by liberty ? ’ “
170142	170148	170114	170114	he	8285	“ ‘ Vive l’Empereur ! ’ ”
170149	170155	170114	170114	he	8285	“ ‘ Vive l’Imperatrice ! ’ ”
170156	170161	170114	170114	he	8285	“ ‘ Vive le Prince Imperial!’”—and
170180	170359	170360	170360	I	0	“ Certainly I can imagine no Court in the old days of chivalry more splendid than the audience in that grand hall of the Louvre . To the right of the throne all the ambassadors of the civilised world in the blaze of their rich costumes and manifold orders . In the gallery at the left , yet more behind , the dresses and jewels of the dames d’honneur and of the great officers of State . And when the Empress rose to depart , certainly my fancy can not picture a more queenlike image , or one that seemed more in unison with the representation of royal pomp and power . The very dress , of colour which would have been fatal to the beauty of most women equally fair — a deep golden colour—(Valerie profanely called it buff)—seemed so to suit the splendour of the ceremony and the day ; it seemed as if that stately form stood in the midst of a sunlight reflected from itself . Day seemed darkened when that sunlight passed away . “
170437	170503	170504	170504	I	0	“ I feel also as if there , in that hall , I found a refuge from all the warring contests in which no two seem to me in agreement as to the sort of government to be established in place of the present . The ‘ Liberty ’ clamoured for by one would cut the throat of the ‘ Liberty ’ worshipped by another . “
170531	170582	170583	170585	the French Sheridan	5368	” Isaura left her letter uncompleted . On the following Monday she was present at a crowded soiree given by M. Louvier . Among the guests were some of the most eminent leaders of the Opposition , including that vivacious master of sharp sayings , M. P———- , whom Savarin entitled “
170587	170636	170583	170585	the French Sheridan	5368	” if laws could be framed in epigrams he would be also the French Solon . There , too , was Victor de Mauleon , regarded by the Republican party with equal admiration and distrust . For the distrust , he himself pleasantly accounted in talk with Savarin . “
170677	170804	170583	170585	the French Sheridan	5368	” A group of admiring listeners had collected round one ( perhaps the most brilliant ) of those oratorical lawyers by whom , in France , the respect for all laws has been so often talked away : he was speaking of the Saturday ’s ceremonial with eloquent indignation . It was a mockery to France to talk of her placing Liberty under the protection of the Empire . There was a flagrant token of the military force under which civil freedom was held in the very dress of the Emperor and his insignificant son : the first in the uniform of a General of Division ; the second , forsooth , in that of a sous - lieutenant . The other liberal chiefs chimed in : “
170808	170812	170583	170585	the French Sheridan	5368	” said one , “
170824	170825	170583	170585	the French Sheridan	5368	” “
170835	170839	170583	170585	the French Sheridan	5368	” said another : “
170847	170852	170840	170841	The Empress	3742	” said a third : “
170875	170965	170966	170966	Your	5375	priestcraft,”—and so on . Isaura , whom any sneer at religion pained and revolted , here turned away from the orators to whom she had before been listening with earnest attention , and her eyes fell on the countenance of De Mauleon , who was seated opposite . The countenance startled her , its expression was so angrily scornful ; that expression , however , vanished at once as De Mauleon ’s eyes met her own , and drawing his chair near to her , he said , smiling : “
171045	171046	171035	171035	he	0	” “
171053	171057	171049	171051	M. de Mauleon	578	” said Isaura , “
171093	171094	171095	171095	I	0	” “
171123	171124	171098	171101	a famous English statesman	5382	” “
171186	171187	171190	171190	Mademoiselle	752	” “
171227	171228	171229	171229	You	5375	” “
171271	171298	171299	171300	Young poetess	5388	” M. de Mauleon paused , and looked at her earnestly with a kindly , half compassionate look , wholly free from the impertinence of gallantry . “
171302	171308	171309	171309	you	5388	” he said , softly , “
171355	171431	171432	171432	You	5388	” The girl felt the blood surge to her temples . How could she have been so self - confessed ? She made no reply , nor did M. de Mauleon seem to expect one ; with that rare delicacy of high breeding which appears in France to belong to a former generation , he changed his tone , and went on as if there had been no interruption to the question her words implied . “
171865	172041	172143	172145	Monsieur de Mauleon	522	“ And how do ces messieurs deal with the French army ? Do they dare to say to the ministers , ‘ Reform it ’ ? Do they dare say , ‘ Prefer for men whose first duty it is to obey , discipline to equality — insist on the distinction between the officer and the private , and never confound it ; Prussian officers are well - educated gentlemen , see that yours are ’ ? Oh no ; they are democrats too stanch not to fraternise with an armed mob ; they content themselves with grudging an extra sou to the Commissariat , and winking at the millions fraudulently pocketed by some ‘ Liberal contractor . ’ Dieu des dieux ! France to be beaten , not as at Waterloo by hosts combined , but in fair duel by a single foe ! Oh , the shame ! the shame ! But as the French army is now organised , beaten she must be , if she meets the march of the German . ”
172042	172051	172053	172053	Isaura	454	“ You appal me with your sinister predictions , ”
172055	172142	172053	172053	Isaura	454	“ but , happily , there is no sign of war . M. Duplessis , who is in the confidence of the Emperor , told us only the other day that Napoleon , on learning the result of the plebiscite , said : ‘ The foreign journalists who have been insisting that the Empire can not coexist with free institutions , will no longer hint that it can be safely assailed from without . ’ And more than ever I may say L’Empire c’est la paix ! ”

172189	172251	172053	172053	Isaura	454	“ Mademoiselle , the Empire opposes me ; while it lasts I can not be even a Depute ; when it is gone , Heaven knows that I may be , perhaps Dictator ; one thing , you may rely upon , that I would , if not Dictator myself , support any man who was better fitted for that task . ”

172278	172322	172323	172323	He	578	imperturbably—“better fitted to establish a good government in lieu of the bad one he had fought against , and the much worse governments that would seek to turn France into a madhouse , and make the maddest of the inmates the mad doctor ! ”

Tell me , can there be any truth in his gloomy predictions ? I try not to think so , but they seem to rest over that brilliant hall of the Louvre like an ominous thunder - cloud . ”
172733	172736	172738	172739	the Chevalier	3696	“ Bagatelle ! ”
172741	172790	172738	172739	the Chevalier	3696	“ Tschu ! Collot , if you give him time , is as safe as the Bank of France , and Louvier knows it . Louvier will not trouble you — Louvier , the best fellow in the world ! I ’ll call on him and explain matters . ”
172880	172884	172885	172885	Alain	351	“ Mon cher , ”
172902	172936	172896	172896	Louvier	399	“ Peste ! do n’t mention such trifles . There is such a thing as business — that concerns my agent ; such a thing as friendship — that concerns me . Allez ! ”
173271	173277	173279	173280	the Chevalier	3696	“ Well , mon cher , ”
173282	173311	173279	173280	the Chevalier	3696	“ I hope that you recovered the favour of Fortune before you quitted her green table last night . When I left she seemed very cross with you . ”

173356	173385	173349	173350	de Finisterre	655	“ the uncertain goddess could not do you much harm ; the stakes were small , and your adversary , the Prince , never goes double or quits . ”
173386	173472	173279	173280	the Chevalier	3696	“ Nor I either . ‘ Small , ’ however , is a word of relative import ; the stakes might be small to you , to me large . Entre nous , cher ami , I am at the end of my purse , and I have only this consolation - I am cured of play : not that I leave the complaint , the complaint leaves me ; it can no more feed on me than a fever can feed on a skeleton . ”
173473	173478	173349	173350	de Finisterre	655	“ Are you serious ? ”
173479	173492	173349	173350	de Finisterre	655	“ As serious as a mourner who has just buried his all . ”
173493	173506	173279	173280	the Chevalier	3696	“ His all ? Tut , with such an estate as Rochebriant ! ”
173520	173566	173349	173350	de Finisterre	655	“ And how long will Rochebriant be mine ? You know that I hold it at the mercy of the mortgagee , whose interest has not been paid , and who could if , he so pleased , issue notice , take proceedings — that — ”
173567	173570	173572	173573	de Finisterre	655	“ Peste ! ”
173575	173607	173572	173573	de Finisterre	655	“ Louvier take proceedings ! Louvier , the best fellow in the world ! But do n’t I see his handwriting on that envelope ? No doubt an invitation to dinner . ”
173744	173748	173769	173770	De Finisterre	677	“ Cher petit Marquis ”
173772	173783	173764	173764	Alain	351	“ Read that from the best fellow in the world . ”
173793	173796	173797	173797	he	655	“ Diable ! ”
173808	173858	173797	173797	he	655	cigarette—“Diable ! Louvier must be much pressed for money , or he would not have written in this strain . What does it matter ? Collot owes you more than 7000 louis . Let your lawyer get them , and go to sleep with both ears on your pillow . ”
173859	173871	173764	173764	Alain	351	“ Ah ! you think Collot can pay if he will ? ”
173872	173902	173797	173797	he	655	“ Ah ! foi ! did not M. Gandrin tell you that M. Collot was safe to buy your wood at more money than any one else would give ? ”
173903	173906	173908	173908	Alain	351	“ Certainly , ”
173912	173951	173908	173908	Alain	351	“ Gandrin left that impression on my mind . I will set him on the man . All will come right , I dare say ; but if it does not come right , what would Louvier do ? ”
173952	173956	173958	173958	Finisterre	677	“ Louvier do ! ”
173962	173972	173958	173958	Finisterre	677	“ Well do you ask my opinion and advice ? ”
173973	173979	173797	173797	he	655	“ Earnestly , I ask . ”
173980	174251	173958	173958	Finisterre	677	“ Honestly , then , I answer . I am a little on the Bourse myself — most Parisians are . Louvier has made a gigantic speculation in this new street , and with so many other irons in the fire he must want all the money he can get at . I dare say that if you do not pay him what you owe , he must leave it to his agent to take steps for announcing the sale of Rochebriant . But he detests scandal ; he hates the notion of being severe ; rather than that , in spite of his difficulties , he will buy Rochebriant of you at a better price than it can command at public sale . Sell it to him . Appeal to him to act generously , and you will flatter him . You will get more than the old place is worth . Invest the surplus — live as you have done , or better — and marry an heiress . Morbleu ! a Marquis de Rochebriant , if he were sixty years old , would rank high in the matrimonial market . The more the democrats have sought to impoverish titles and laugh down historical names , the more do rich democrat fathers - in - law seek to decorate their daughters with titles and give their grandchildren the heritage of historical names . You look shocked , pauvre anti . Let us hope , then , that Collot will pay . Set your dog — I mean your lawyer — at him ; seize him by the throat ! ”
174433	174437	174439	174440	the Chevalier	3696	“ Ma foi ! ”
174447	174493	174439	174440	the Chevalier	3696	“ how time flies ! I had no idea it was so late . I must leave you now , my dear Rochebriant . Perhaps we shall meet at the club later — I dine there to - day . Au plaisir , M. Lemercier . ”
174520	174611	174517	174517	he	352	“ We have not seen much of each other lately,—nay , no excuses ; I am well aware that it could scarcely be otherwise . Paris has grown so large and so subdivided into sets , that the best friends belonging to different sets become as divided as if the Atlantic flowed between them . I come to - day in consequence of something I have just heard from Duplessis . Tell me , have you got the money for the wood you sold to M. Collot a year ago ? ”
174612	174615	174617	174617	Alain	351	“ No , ”
174621	174629	174617	174617	Alain	351	“ Good heavens ! none of it ? ”
174630	174665	174517	174517	he	352	“ Only the deposit of ten per cent . , which of course I spent , for it formed the greater part of my income . What of Collot ? Is he really unsafe ? ”
174666	174694	174695	174695	Alain	351	“ He is ruined , and has fled the country . His flight was the talk of the Bourse this morning . Duplessis told me of it . ”
174700	174712	174713	174713	Lemercier	352	“ How is Louvier to be paid ? Read that letter ! ”
174726	174748	174716	174716	his	352	“ It is true , then , that you owe this man a year ’s interest — more than 7,000 louis ? ”
174749	174822	174517	174517	he	352	“ Somewhat more — yes . But that is not the first care that troubles me — Rochebriant may be lost , but with it not my honour . I owe the Russian Prince 300 louis , lost to him last night at ecarte . I must find a purchaser for my coupe and horses ; they cost me 600 louis last year,—do you know any one who will give me three ? ”
174823	174841	174517	174517	he	352	“ Pooh ! I will give you six ; your alezan alone is worth half the money ! ”
174842	174865	174716	174716	his	352	“ My dear Frederic , I will not sell them to you on any account . But you have so many friends — ”
174866	174900	174517	174517	he	352	“ Who would give their soul to say , ‘ I bought these horses of Rochebriant . ’ Of course I do . Ha ! young Rameau , you are acquainted with him ? ”
174901	174910	174517	174517	he	352	“ Rameau ! I never heard of him ! ”
174911	174935	174716	174716	his	352	“ Vanity of vanities , then what is fame ? Rameau is the editor of Le Sens Commun . You read that journal ? ”
174936	174960	174517	174517	he	352	“ Yes , it has clever articles , and I remember how I was absorbed in the eloquent romance which appeared in it . ”
174961	174980	174517	174517	he	352	“ Ah ! by the Signora Cicogna , with whom I think you were somewhat smitten last year . ”
174981	175014	174716	174716	his	352	“ Last year — was I ? How a year can alter a man ! But my debt to the Prince . What has Le Sens Commun to do with my horses ? ”
175015	175076	174517	174517	he	352	“ I met Rameau at Savarin ’s the other evening . He was making himself out a hero and a martyr ! his coupe had been taken from him to assist in a barricade in that senseless emeute ten days ago ; the coupe got smashed , the horses disappeared . He will buy one of your horses and coupe . “

175350	175837	175838	175838	I	0	” Lemercier went , and in less than two hours sent the Marquis bank - notes for 600 louis , requesting an order for the delivery of the horses and carriage . That order written and signed , Alain hastened to acquit himself of his debt of honour , and contemplating his probable ruin with a lighter heart presented himself at the Hotel Duplessis . Duplessis made no pretensions to vie with the magnificent existence of Louvier . His house , though agreeably situated and flatteringly styled the Hotel Duplessis , was of moderate size , very unostentatiously furnished ; nor was it accustomed to receive the brilliant motley crowds which assembled in the salons of the elder financier . Before that year , indeed , Duplessis had confined such entertainments as he gave to quiet men of business , or a few of the more devoted and loyal partisans of the Imperial dynasty ; but since Valerie came to live with him he had extended his hospitalities to wider and livelier circles , including some celebrities in the world of art and letters as well as of fashion . Of the party assembled that evening at dinner were Isaura , with the Signora Venosta , one of the Imperial Ministers , the Colonel whom Alain had already met at Lemercier ’s supper , Deputes ( ardent Imperialists ) , and the Duchesse de Tarascon ; these , with Alain and Frederic , made up the party . The conversation was not particularly gay . Duplessis himself , though an exceedingly well - read and able man , had not the genial accomplishments of a brilliant host . Constitutionally grave and habitually taciturn — though there were moments in which he was roused out of his wonted self into eloquence or wit — he seemed to - day absorbed in some engrossing train of thought . The Minister , the Deputes and the Duchesse de Tarascon talked politics , and ridiculed the trumpery emeute of the 14th ; exulted in the success of the plebiscite ; and admitting , with indignation , the growing strength of Prussia , and — with scarcely less indignation , but more contempt , censuring the selfish egotism of England in disregarding the due equilibrium of the European balance of power,—hinted at the necessity of annexing Belgium as a set - off against the results of Sadowa . Alain found himself seated next to Isaura — to the woman who had so captivated his eye and fancy on his first arrival in Paris . Remembering his last conversation with Graham nearly a year ago , he felt some curiosity to ascertain whether the rich Englishman had proposed to her , and if so , been refused or accepted . The first words that passed between them were trite enough , but after a little pause in the talk , Alain said : “
175876	175877	175871	175871	him	505	” “
175902	175958	175894	175897	a friend of his	5473	” Though Isaura strove to speak in a tone of indifference , Alain ’s ear detected a ring of pain in her voice ; and watching her countenance , he was impressed with a saddened change in its expression . He was touched , and his curiosity was mingled with a gentler interest as he said “
175994	176015	175989	175989	she	5474	” Isaura turned her face quickly towards the speaker , and her lips moved , but she said nothing audibly . “
176024	176037	175989	175989	she	5474	” thought Alain ; and after that question his heart asked itself , “
176057	176061	175989	175989	she	5474	” and his heart answered—“Eighteen
176199	176265	176275	176275	he	8366	” He could not again think of that fair creature as a prize that he might even dare to covet . And as he met her inquiring eyes , and saw her quivering lip , he felt instinctively that Graham was dear to her , and that the tender interest with which she inspired himself was untroubled by one pang of jealousy . He resumed : “
176328	176329	176330	176330	You	0	” “
176340	176341	176336	176337	Mr. Vane	378	” “
176379	176426	176427	176427	Mademoiselle	752	” Isaura ’s face brightened with the joy we feel when we hear the praise of those we love . At this moment , Duplessis , who had been observing the Italian and the young Marquis , for the first time during dinner , broke silence . “
176429	176439	176427	176427	Mademoiselle	752	” he said , addressing Isaura across the table , “
176483	176529	176530	176530	I	0	” Elated by Alain ’s report of Graham ’s words , by the conviction that these words applied to herself , and by the thought that her renunciation of the stage removed a barrier between them , Isaura answered , with a sort of enthusiasm : “
176580	176581	176583	176584	M. Vane	834	” “
176588	176596	176583	176584	M. Vane	834	” said Alain , in a whisper . “
176599	176600	176608	176608	he	361	” “
176630	176855	176856	176856	Dame	835	” All this while , Valerie , who was seated at the further end of the table beside the Minister , who had taken her in to dinner , had been watching , with eyes , the anxious tearful sorrow of which none but her father had noticed , the low - voiced confidence between Alain and the friend , whom till that day she had so enthusiastically loved . Hitherto she had been answering in monosyllables all attempts of the great man to draw her into conversation ; but now , observing how Isaura blushed and looked down , that strange faculty in women , which we men call dissimulation , and which in them is truthfulness to their own nature , enabled her to carry off the sharpest anguish she had ever experienced , by a sudden burst of levity of spirit . She caught up some commonplace the Minister had adapted to what he considered the poverty of her understanding , with a quickness of satire which startled that grave man , and he gazed at her astonished . Up to that moment he had secretly admired her as a girl well brought up — as girls fresh from a French convent are supposed to be ; now , hearing her brilliant rejoinder to his stupid observation , he said inly : “
176869	177127	176856	176856	Dame	835	” But , being a clever man himself , her retort put him on his mettle , and he became , to his own amazement , brilliant himself . With that matchless quickness which belongs to Parisians , the guests around him seized the new esprit de conversation which had been evoked between the statesman and the childlike girl beside him ; and as they caught up the ball , lightly flung among them , they thought within themselves how much more sparkling the financier ’s pretty , lively daughter was than that dark - eyed young muse , of whom all the journalists of Paris were writing in a chorus of welcome and applause , and who seemed not to have a word to say worth listening to , except to the handsome young Marquis , whom , no doubt , she wished to fascinate . Valerie fairly outshone Isaura in intellect and in wit ; and neither Valerie nor Isaura cared , to the value of a bean - straw , about that distinction . Each was thinking only of the prize which the humblest peasant women have in common with the most brilliantly accomplished of their sex — the heart of a man beloved . On the Continent generally , as we all know , men do not sit drinking wine together after the ladies retire . So when the signal was given all the guests adjourned to the salon ; and Alain quitted Isaura to gain the ear of the Duchesse de Tarascon . “
177140	177143	177144	177144	my	0	” said the Marquis—“since

177541	177550	177551	177551	Dreamer	836	” interrupted Alain , with a brightening eye . “
177571	177657	177658	177658	Duplessis	752	” While the Duchesse and Alain were thus conversing , Isaura had seated herself by Valerie , and , unconscious of the offence she had given , addressed her in those pretty caressing terms with which young - lady friends are wo nt to compliment each other ; but Valerie answered curtly or sarcastically , and turned aside to converse with the Minister . A few minutes more , and the party began to break up . Lemercier , however , detained Alain , whispering , “
177674	177675	177658	177658	Duplessis	752	” “
177680	177698	177699	177699	Lemercier	352	” said Duplessis , when the salon was cleared of all but himself and the two friends , “

177744	177748	177736	177736	I	0	” answered Alain , “

178151	178165	178139	178139	you	369	” answered Alain , feeling frostbitten by the congealing words of his counsellor ; “

178239	178240	178242	178242	he	5424	” “

178460	178488	178448	178450	M. le Marquis	393	” said Duplessis , folding up the paper on which he had made his notes , but fixing on Alain quiet eyes half concealed under drooping lids . “
178493	178497	178448	178450	M. le Marquis	393	” cried Rochebriant , rising—“agree
178553	178569	178570	178571	le Marquis	393	” Duplessis , habitually the driest of men , rose with a moistened eye and flushing cheek—“Monsieur
178644	178698	178704	178704	Marquis	393	but,”—here Duplessis paused a minute , and then lowering the tone of his voice , which had been somewhat vehement and enthusiastic , into that of a colloquial good - fellowship , equally rare to the measured reserve of the financier , he asked , with a lively twinkle of his grey eye , “
178716	178717	178713	178714	M. Louvier	399	” “
178726	178732	178734	178734	his	399	” asked Alain , innocently . “

179386	179420	179379	179379	his	399	” cried Lemercier , clapping his hands . Lemercier had the spirit of party , and felt for Duplessis against Louvier much as in England Whig feels against Tory , or vice versa . “
179424	179429	179379	179379	his	399	” resumed Duplessis , more soberly,—“perhaps
179581	179582	179564	179564	I	0	” “
179596	179600	179592	179592	you	0	” said Alain ; “
179632	179767	179768	179768	Child	843	” So , linking his arm in Lemercier ’s , Alain made his bow and withdrew . When his guests had gone , Duplessis remained seated in meditation — apparently pleasant meditation , for he smiled while indulging it ; he then passed through the reception - rooms to one at the far end appropriated to Valerie as a boudoir or morning - room , adjoining her bed - chamber ; he knocked gently at the door , and , all remaining silent within , he opened it noiselessly and entered . Valerie was reclining on the sofa near the window - her head drooping , her hands clasped on her knees . Duplessis neared her with tender stealthy steps , passed his arm round her , and drew her head towards his bosom . “
179770	179774	179775	179776	my child	8768	” he murmured ; “
179782	179836	179775	179776	my child	8768	” At that soft loving voice , Valerie flung her arms round him , and wept aloud like an infant in trouble . He seated himself beside her , and wisely suffered her to weep on , till her passion had exhausted itself ; he then said , half fondly , half chillingly : “
179885	179886	179887	179887	Father	5593	” “
179948	179949	179950	179950	Valerie	752	” “
180106	180249	180253	180253	yourself	5603	” As this man thus spoke you would scarcely have recognized in him the old saturnine Duplessis , his countenance became so beautified by the one soft feeling which care and contest , ambition and money - seeking , had left unaltered in his heart . Perhaps there is no country in which the love of parent and child , especially of father and daughter , is so strong as it is in France ; even in the most arid soil , among the avaricious , even among the profligate , it forces itself into flower . Other loves fade away : in the heart of the true Frenchman that parent love blooms to the last . Valerie felt the presence of that love as a divine protecting guardianship . She sank on her knees and covered his hand with grateful kisses . “
180353	180950	180345	180345	You	5603	” On waking some morning , have you ever felt , reader , as if a change for the brighter in the world , without and within you , had suddenly come to pass - some new glory has been given to the sunshine , some fresh balm to the air - you feel younger , and happier , and lighter , in the very beat of your heart - you almost fancy you hear the chime of some spiritual music far off , as if in the deeps of heaven ? You are not at first conscious how , or wherefore , this change has been brought about . Is it the effect of a dream in the gone sleep , that has made this morning so different from mornings that have dawned before ? And while vaguely asking yourself that question , you become aware that the cause is no mere illusion , that it has its substance in words spoken by living lips , in things that belong to the work - day world . It was thus that Isaura woke the morning after the conversation with Alain de Rochebriant , and as certain words , then spoken , echoed back on her ear , she knew why she was so happy , why the world was so changed . In those words she heard the voice of Graham Vane — nor she had not deceived herself — she was loved ! she was loved ! What mattered that long cold interval of absence ? She had not forgotten — she could not believe that absence had brought forgetfulness . There are moments when we insist on judging another ’s heart by our own . All would be explained some day — all would come right . How lovely was the face that reflected itself in the glass as she stood before it , smoothing back her long hair , murmuring sweet snatches of Italian love - song , and blushing with sweeter love - thoughts as she sang ! All that had passed in that year so critical to her outer life — the authorship , the fame , the public career , the popular praise — vanished from her mind as a vapour that rolls from the face of a lake to which the sunlight restores the smile of a brightened heaven . She was more the girl now than she had ever been since the day on which she sat reading Tasso on the craggy shore of Sorrento . Singing still as she passed from her chamber , and entering the sitting - room , which fronted the east , and seemed bathed in the sunbeams of deepening May , she took her bird from its cage , and stopped her song to cover it with kisses , which perhaps yearned for vent somewhere . Later in the day she went out to visit Valerie . Recalling the altered manner of her young friend , her sweet nature became troubled . She divined that Valerie had conceived some jealous pain which she longed to heal ; she could not bear the thought of leaving any one that day unhappy . Ignorant before of the girl ’s feelings towards Alain , she now partly guessed them — one woman who loves in secret is clairvoyante as to such secrets in another . Valerie received her visitor with a coldness she did not attempt to disguise . Not seeming to notice this , Isaura commenced the conversation with frank mention of Rochebriant . “
180999	181000	181001	181001	You	5608	” “
181025	181026	181015	181015	you	5608	” “
181049	181050	181054	181056	M. de Rochebriant	387	” “
181070	181099	181104	181105	naughty child	5612	” To her surprise and indignation , Valerie here felt the arm of Isaura tenderly entwining her waist , and her face drawn towards Isaura ’s sisterly kiss . “
181152	181304	181145	181145	Valerie	752	” Valerie here drew back her pretty childlike head , gazed keenly a moment into Isaura ’s eyes , felt convinced by the limpid candour of their unmistakable honesty , and flinging herself on her friend ’s bosom , kissed her passionately , and burst into tears . The complete reconciliation between the two girls was thus peacefully effected ; and then Isaura had to listen , at no small length , to the confidences poured into her ears by Valerie , who was fortunately too engrossed by her own hopes and doubts to exact confidences in return . Valerie ’s was one of those impulsive eager natures that longs for a confidante . Not so Isaura ’s . Only when Valerie had unburthened her heart , and been soothed and caressed into happy trust in the future , did she recall Isaura ’s explanatory words , and said , archly : “
181322	181323	181316	181316	he	5616	” “
181326	181345	181346	181346	they	5617	” said Isaura , rising to take up the mantle and hat she had laid aside on entering , “
181364	181381	181346	181346	they	5617	” Then with a grave melancholy in the look she fixed upon Valerie , she added : “
181497	182055	182056	182056	My	0	” That evening the Morleys looked in at Isaura ’s on their way to a crowded assembly at the house of one of those rich Americans , who were then outvying the English residents at Paris in the good graces of Parisian society . I think the Americans get on better with the French than the English do — I mean the higher class of Americans . They spend more money ; their men speak French better ; the women are better dressed , and , as a general rule , have read more largely , and converse more frankly . Mrs. Morley ’s affection for Isaura had increased during the last few months . As so notable an advocate of the ascendancy of her sex , she felt a sort of grateful pride in the accomplishments and growing renown of so youthful a member of the oppressed sisterhood . But , apart from that sentiment , she had conceived a tender mother - like interest for the girl who stood in the world so utterly devoid of family ties , so destitute of that household guardianship and protection which , with all her assertion of the strength and dignity of woman , and all her opinions as to woman ’s right of absolute emancipation from the conventions fabricated by the selfishness of man , Mrs. Morley was too sensible not to value for the individual , though she deemed it not needed for the mass . Her great desire was that Isaura should marry well , and soon . American women usually marry so young that it seemed to Mrs. Morley an anomaly in social life , that one so gifted in mind and person as Isaura should already have passed the age in which the belles of the great Republic are enthroned as wives and consecrated as mothers . We have seen that in the past year she had selected from our unworthy but necessary sex , Graham Vane as a suitable spouse to her young friend . She had divined the state of his heart — she had more than suspicions of the state of Isaura ’s . She was exceedingly perplexed and exceedingly chafed at the Englishman ’s strange disregard to his happiness and her own projects . She had counted , all this past winter , on his return to Paris ; and she became convinced that some misunderstanding , possibly some lover ’s quarrel , was the cause of his protracted absence , and a cause that , if ascertained , could be removed . A good opportunity now presented itself — Colonel Morley was going to London the next day . He had business there which would detain him at least a week . He would see Graham ; and as she considered her husband the shrewdest and wisest person in the world — I mean of the male sex — she had no doubt of his being able to turn Graham ’s mind thoroughly inside out , and ascertain his exact feelings and intentions . If the Englishman , thus assayed , were found of base metal , then , at least , Mrs. Morley would be free to cast him altogether aside , and coin for the uses of the matrimonial market some nobler effigy in purer gold . “
182060	182088	182056	182056	My	0	” said Mrs. Morley , in a low voice , nestling herself close to Isaura , while the Colonel , duly instructed , drew off the Venosta , “
182101	182150	182098	182099	Mr. Vane	378	” You can guess with what artful design Mrs. Morley put that question point - blank , fixing keen eyes on Isaura while she put it . She saw the heightened colour , the quivering lip of the girl thus abruptly appealed to , and she said inly : “
182159	182160	182098	182099	Mr. Vane	378	” “
182171	182172	182164	182165	Mr. Vane	378	” “
182180	182181	182174	182174	he	378	” “
182204	182205	182206	182206	Frank	526	” “
182354	182373	182374	182374	I	0	” Isaura ’s heart heaved beneath her robe , but she replied in a tone of astonishing indifference : “
182402	182403	182404	182405	Nous verrons	845	” “
182473	182606	182611	182611	dear	5635	” Here the Venosta , with whom the poor Colonel had exhausted all the arts at his command for chaining her attention , could be no longer withheld from approaching Mrs. Morley , and venting her admiration of that lady ’s wreath , earrings , robes , flounces . This dazzling apparition had on her the effect which a candle has on a moth — she fluttered round it , and longed to absorb herself in its blaze . But the wreath especially fascinated her — a wreath which no prudent lady with colourings less pure , and features less exquisitely delicate than the pretty champion of the rights of women , could have fancied on her own brows without a shudder . But the Venosta in such matters was not prudent . “
182613	182624	182611	182611	dear	5635	” she cried piteously , extending her arms towards Isaura . “
182644	182645	182636	182637	Cara signora	846	” “
182659	182672	182673	182673	Madame	9988	” and Mrs. Morley glanced significantly at her well - tutored Frank . “
182675	182732	182673	182673	Madame	9988	” said the Colonel , speaking in English , which he usually did with the Venosta — who valued herself on knowing that language and was flattered to be addressed in it — while he amused himself by introducing into its forms the dainty Americanisms with which he puzzled the Britisher — he might well puzzle the Florentine,—“Madame
182792	182793	182794	182795	Wicked man	5642	” “
182797	182809	182794	182795	Wicked man	5642	” cried the Venosta , shaking her finger at him coquettishly . “
182830	182847	182828	182828	women	1178	” and then , with a cynicism that might have become a greybeard , she added , “
182872	182885	182870	182870	Colonello	847	” The Colonel looked puzzled , bowed , and made no reply . “
182890	182897	182870	182870	Colonello	847	” said Mrs. Morley , rising , “
182913	182914	182915	182915	I	0	” “
182923	182969	182915	182915	I	0	” said Frank , glancing at the clock . In theory the most rebellious , in practice the most obedient , of wives , Mrs. Morley here kissed Isaura , resettled her crinoline , and shaking hands with the Venosta , retreated to the door . “
182977	182984	182970	182970	I	0	” cried the Venosta , impishly . “
182989	182996	182970	182970	I	0	” ( Hope is female ) . “
182999	183009	182970	182970	I	0	” said Isaura , half mournfully , half smiling , “
183037	183141	183142	183142	We	5652	” Graham Vane was musing very gloomily in his solitary apartment one morning , when his servant announced Colonel Morley . He received his visitor with more than the cordiality with which every English politician receives an American citizen . Graham liked the Colonel too well for what he was in himself to need any national title to his esteem . After some preliminary questions and answers as to the health of Mrs. Morley , the length of the Colonel ’s stay in London , what day he could dine with Graham at Richmond or Gravesend , the Colonel took up the ball . “
183160	183161	183142	183142	We	5652	” “
183193	183194	183197	183197	you	8224	” “
183264	183273	183274	183274	My	0	” Graham glanced over the note addressed to him “
183278	183285	183276	183276	Morley	462	” said Graham , with emotion , “
183311	183312	183305	183305	I	0	” “
183315	183322	183305	183305	I	0	” asked the Colonel , drily . “
183332	183333	183323	183323	I	0	” “
183361	183438	183342	183342	I	0	” The Americans enjoy the reputation of being the frankest putters of questions whom liberty of speech has yet educated into la recherche de la verite , and certainly Colonel Morley in this instance did not impair the national reputation . Graham Vane ’s brow slightly contracted , and he bit his lip as if stung by a sudden pang ; but after a moment ’s pause , he answered with a good - humoured smile : “
183469	183470	183471	183471	My	0	” “
183502	183503	183475	183475	I	0	” “
183639	183648	183620	183620	Lord	5670	” Morley hesitated ; but when Graham said , “
183693	183758	183681	183681	Disraeli	849	” the Colonel gave in , and it was settled that Graham should call for him at the Langham Hotel . That matter arranged , Graham probably hoped that his inquisitive visitor would take leave for the present , but the Colonel evinced no such intention . On the contrary , settling himself more at ease in his arm - chair , he said , “
183774	184081	183764	183764	you	5664	” Graham rose and presented to his visitor a cigar - box which he took from the mantelpiece . The Colonel shook his head , and withdrew from his breast pocket a leather case , from which he extracted a gigantic regalia ; this he lighted from a gold match - box in the shape of a locket attached to his watch - chain , and took two or three preliminary puffs , with his head thrown back and his eyes meditatively intent upon the ceiling . We know already that strange whim of the Colonel ’s ( than whom , if he so pleased , no man could speak purer English as spoken by the Britisher ) to assert the dignity of the American citizen by copious use of expressions and phrases familiar to the lips of the governing class of the great Republic — delicacies of speech which he would have carefully shunned in the polite circles of the Fifth Avenue in New York . Now the Colonel was much too experienced a man of the world not to be aware that the commission with which his Lizzy had charged him was an exceedingly delicate one ; and it occurred to his mother wit that the best way to acquit himself of it , so as to avoid the risk of giving or of receiving serious affront , would be to push that whim of his into more than wonted exaggeration . Thus he could more decidedly and briefly come to the point ; and should he , in doing so , appear too meddlesome , rather provoke a laugh than a frown - retiring from the ground with the honours due to a humorist . Accordingly , in his deepest nasal intonation , and withdrawing his eyes from the ceiling , he began : “
184103	184104	184106	184106	I	0	” “
184124	184125	184121	184122	Signora Venosta	430	” “
184173	184174	184156	184156	you	8224	” “
184201	184202	184198	184198	she	481	” “
184284	184315	184281	184282	Eulalie Grantmesnil	432	” Graham ’s cheek became as white as the paper I write on . He inclined his head as in assent , but without a word . The Colonel continued : “
184364	184365	184366	184366	I	0	” “
184454	184455	184456	184456	He	551	” “
184478	184479	184456	184456	He	551	” “
184636	184667	184632	184634	La Sens Commun	5707	” The Colonel here withdrew his cigar from his lips , lowered his head to a level with Graham ’s , and relaxing into an arch significant smile , said : “
184708	184736	184694	184694	You	5702	” Never was England in greater danger of quarrel with America than at that moment ; but Graham curbed his first wrathful impulse , and replied coldly : “
184867	184868	184869	184869	I	0	” “
184874	184880	184869	184869	I	0	” replied the Colonel serenely . “
184948	184964	184970	184970	You	0	” Here the Colonel resumed his regalia , and again gazed intent on the ceiling . “
184983	184984	184970	184970	You	0	” “
185007	185008	185009	185009	You	0	” “
185023	185024	185016	185016	I	0	” “
185079	185102	185058	185058	sir	8224	” Graham could not help smiling at the persistent officiousness of his visitor , but his smile was a very sad one . “
185155	185156	185157	185157	Sir	8224	” “
185159	185166	185157	185157	Sir	8224	” replied the Colonel , imperturbably , “
185340	185341	185342	185342	I	0	” “
185355	185404	185405	185405	You	462	” The Colonel here , rising , extended his hand , which Graham shook with constrained cordiality , and then leisurely walked to the door ; there he paused , as if struck by a new thought , and said gravely , in his natural tone of voice , “
185422	185423	185405	185405	You	462	” “
185437	185446	185428	185429	Colonel Morley	462	” The Colonel resumed his deepest nasal bass : “
185724	186003	185705	185705	sir	8224	” By the post that day the Colonel transmitted a condensed and laconic report of his conversation with Graham Vane . I can state its substance in yet fewer words . He wrote word that Graham positively declined the invitation to Paris ; that he had then , agreeably to Lizzy ’s instruction , ventilated the Englishman , in the most delicate terms , as to his intentions with regard to Isaura , and that no intentions at all existed . The sooner all thoughts of him were relinquished , as a new suitor on the ground , the better it would be for the young lady ’s happiness in the only state in which happiness should be , if not found , at least sought , whether by maid or man . Mrs. Morley was extremely put out by this untoward result of the diplomacy she had intrusted to the Colonel ; and when , the next day , came a very courteous letter from Graham , thanking her gratefully for the kindness of her invitation , and expressing his regret briefly , though cordially , at his inability to profit by it , without the most distant allusion to the subject which the Colonel had brought on the tapis , or even requesting his compliments to the Signoras Venosta and Cicogna , she was more than put out , more than resentful,—she was deeply grieved . Being , however , one of those gallant heroes of womankind who do not give in at the first defeat , she began to doubt whether Frank had not rather overstrained the delicacy which he said he had put into his “
186006	186175	185705	185705	sir	8224	” He ought to have been more explicit . Meanwhile she resolved to call on Isaura , and , without mentioning Graham ’s refusal of her invitation , endeavour to ascertain whether the attachment which she felt persuaded the girl secretly cherished for this recalcitrant Englishman were something more than the first romantic fancy — whether it were sufficiently deep to justify farther effort on Mrs. Morley ’s part to bring it to a prosperous issue . She found Isaura at home and alone ; and , to do her justice , she exhibited wonderful tact in the fulfilment of the task she had set herself . Forming her judgment by manner and look — not words — she returned home , convinced that she ought to seize the opportunity afforded to her by Graham ’s letter . It was one to which she might very naturally reply , and in that reply she might convey the object at her heart more felicitously than the Colonel had done . “
186181	186187	186176	186178	The cleverest man	5752	” she said to herself , “
186210	186347	186191	186193	an ordinary woman	5753	” Now there was one point she had ascertained by words in her visit to Isaura — a point on which all might depend . She had asked Isaura when and where she had seen Graham last ; and when Isaura had given her that information , and she learned it was on the eventful day on which Isaura gave her consent to the publication of her MS . if approved by Savarin , in the journal to be set up by the handsome - faced young author , she leapt to the conclusion that Graham had been seized with no unnatural jealousy , and was still under the illusive glamoury of that green - eyed fiend . She was confirmed in this notion , not altogether an unsound one , when asking with apparent carelessness , “
186371	186399	186400	186400	His	378	” Isaura turned away pale , and involuntarily clasping her hands - as women do when they would suppress pain - replied , in a low murmur , “
186405	186418	186400	186400	His	378	” Accordingly , Mrs. Morley sat down and wrote the following letter : “
186611	186790	186791	186791	My	0	“ But I am not writing merely to scold you . I have something else on my mind , and it must come out . Certainly , when you were at Paris last year you did admire , above all other young ladies , Isaura Cicogna . And I honoured you for doing so . I know no other young lady to be called her equal . Well , if you admired her then , what would you do now if you met her ? Then she was but a girl — very brilliant , very charming , it is true — but undeveloped , untested . Now she is a woman , a princess among women , but retaining all that is most lovable in a girl ; so courted , yet so simple — so gifted , yet so innocent . Her head is not a bit turned by all the flattery that surrounds her . Come and judge for yourself . I still hold the door of the rooms destined to you open for repentance . “
186819	186927	186815	186817	a coeur ouvert	5763	“ I like you so much that I would fain secure to you the rarest prize which life is ever likely to offer to your ambition . Where can you hope to find another Isaura ? Among the stateliest daughters of your English dukes , where is there one whom a proud man would be more proud to show to the world , saying , ‘ She is mine ! ’ where one more distinguished — I will not say by mere beauty , there she might be eclipsed — but by sweetness and dignity combined — in aspect , manner , every movement , every smile ? “
187227	187362	187185	187185	her	481	” There is somewhere in Lord Lytton ’s writings — writings so numerous that I may be pardoned if I can not remember where - a critical definition of the difference between dramatic and narrative art of story , instanced by that marvellous passage in the loftiest of Sir Walter Scott ’s works , in which all the anguish of Ravenswood on the night before he has to meet Lucy ’s brother in mortal combat is conveyed without the spoken words required in tragedy . It is only to be conjectured by the tramp of his heavy boots to and fro all the night long in his solitary chamber , heard below by the faithful Caleb . The drama could not have allowed that treatment ; the drama must have put into words , as “
187365	187576	187185	187185	her	481	” agonies which the non - dramatic narrator knows that no soliloquy can describe . Humbly do I imitate , then , the great master of narrative in declining to put into words the conflict between love and reason that tortured the heart of Graham Vane when , dropping noiselessly the letter I have just transcribed , he covered his face with his hands and remained — I know not how long — in the same position , his head bowed , not a sound escaping from his lips . He did not stir from his rooms that day ; and had there been a Caleb ’s faithful ear to listen , his tread , too , might have been heard all that sleepless night passing to and fro , but pausing oft , along his solitary floors . Possibly love would have borne down all opposing seasonings , doubts , and prejudices , but for incidents that occurred the following evening . On that evening Graham dined en famille with his cousins the Altons . After dinner , the Duke produced the design for a cenotaph inscribed to the memory of his aunt , Lady Janet King , which he proposed to place in the family chapel at Alton . “
187580	187587	187588	187588	you	5775	” said the Duke , kindly , “
187697	187824	187687	187687	I	0	” Graham wrung his cousin ’s hand - he could not speak , choked by suppressed tears . The Duchess , who loved and honoured Lady Janet almost as much as did her husband , fairly sobbed aloud . She had , indeed , reason for grateful memories of the deceased : there had been some obstacles to her marriage with the man who had won her heart , arising from political differences and family feuds between their parents , which the gentle meditation of Lady Janet had smoothed away . And never did union founded on mutual and ardent love more belie the assertions of the great Bichat ( esteemed by Dr. Buckle the finest intellect which practical philosophy has exhibited since Aristotle ) , that “
187839	187899	187687	187687	I	0	” than that between those eccentric specimens of a class denounced as frivolous and artless by philosophers , English and French , who have certainly never heard of Bichat . When the emotion the Duke had exhibited was calmed down , his wife pushed towards Graham a sheet of paper , inscribed with the epitaph composed by his hand . “
187905	187909	187687	187687	I	0	” she said , falteringly—“not
187918	188026	187687	187687	I	0	” Graham read the inscription slowly , and with very dimmed eyes . It deserved the praise bestowed on it ; for the Duke , though a shy and awkward speaker , was an incisive and graceful writer . Yet , in his innermost self , Graham shivered when he read that epitaph , it expressed so emphatically the reverential nature of the love which Lady Janet had inspired — the genial influences which the holiness of a character so active in doing good had diffused around it . It brought vividly before Graham that image of perfect spotless womanhood . And a voice within him asked , “
188084	188101	188102	188102	My	0	” He remained so silent after putting down the inscription , that the Duke said modestly : “
188183	188184	188185	188185	I	0	” “
188193	188197	188185	188185	I	0	” said Graham ; “
188220	188221	188222	188222	I	0	” “
188238	188254	188229	188229	Leopold	865	” said the duchess , whose hand was resting fondly on her husband ’s shoulder . “
188291	188292	188278	188289	the only woman I ever knew whom one could praise in safety	5793	” “
188296	188303	188278	188289	the only woman I ever knew whom one could praise in safety	5793	” said the Duke , smiling : “
188397	188398	188399	188399	I	0	” “
188416	188417	188399	188399	I	0	” “
188420	188425	188399	188399	I	0	” said the Duchess ; “
188479	188629	188456	188456	I	0	” Here she put her arm into Graham ’s , and led him into her own private drawing - room , which , though others might call it a boudoir , she dignified by the name of her study . The Duke remained for some minutes thoughtfully leaning his arm on the mantelpiece . It was no unimportant debate in the Lords that night , and on a subject in which he took great interest , and the details of which he had thoroughly mastered . He had been requested to speak , if only a few words , for his high character and his reputation for good sense gave weight to the mere utterance of his opinion . But though no one had more moral courage in action , the Duke had a terror at the very thought of addressing an audience , which made him despise himself . “
188632	188636	188456	188456	I	0	” he muttered , “
188686	188812	188676	188676	he	378	” The letter from Lady Janet , which the Duchess took from the desk and placed in Graham ’s hand , was in strange coincidence with the subject that for the last twenty - four hours had absorbed his thoughts and tortured his heart . Speaking of him in terms of affectionate eulogy , the writer proceeded to confide her earnest wish that he should not longer delay that change in life which , concentrating so much that is vague in the desires and aspirations of man , leaves his heart and his mind , made serene by the contentment of home , free for the steadfast consolidation of their warmth and their light upon the ennobling duties that unite the individual to his race . “
188818	188823	188815	188816	no one	9103	” wrote Lady Janet , “
189022	189137	189138	189141	The wife for Graham	5806	“ It is interwoven with that lofty independence of spirit which has made him refuse openings the most alluring to his ambition ; it communicates a touching grandeur to his self - denying thrift ; it makes him so tenacious of his word once given , so cautious before he gives it . Public life to him is essential ; without it he would be incomplete ; and yet I sigh to think that whatever success he may achieve in it will be attended with proportionate pain . Calumny goes side by side with fame , and courting fame as a man , he is as thin - skinned to calumny as a woman . “
189161	189362	189363	189364	No,—Graham Vane	869	“ She must have mind enough to appreciate his — not to clash with it . She must be fitted with sympathies to be his dearest companion , his confidante in the hopes and fears which the slightest want of sympathy would make him keep ever afterwards pent within his breast . In herself worthy of distinction , she must merge all distinction in his . You have met in the world men who , marrying professed beauties , or professed literary geniuses , are spoken of as the husband of the beautiful Mrs. A — — — , or of the clever Mrs. B———- : can you fancy Graham Vane in the reflected light of one of those husbands ? I trembled last year when I thought he was attracted by a face which the artists raved about , and again by a tongue which dropped bons mots that went the round of the club . I was relieved , when , sounding him , he said , laughingly , ‘ No , dear aunt , I should be one sore from head to foot if I married a wife that was talked about for anything but goodness . ’ “
189452	189671	189672	189673	Lady Janet	466	“ Do you understand me , dearest Eleanor ? No doubt you do so far , that you comprehend that the women whom men most admire are not the women we , as women ourselves , would wish our sons or brothers to marry . But perhaps you do not comprehend my cause of fear , which is this — for in such matters men do not see as we women do — Graham abhors , in the girls of our time , frivolity and insipidity . Very rightly , you will say . True , but then he is too likely to be allured by contrasts . I have seen him attracted by the very girls we recoil from more than we do from those we allow to be frivolous and insipid . I accused him of admiration for a certain young lady whom you call ‘ odious , ’ and whom the slang that has come into vogue calls ‘ fast ; ’ and I was not satisfied with his answer , ‘ Certainly I admire her ; she is not a doll — she has ideas . ’ I would rather of the two see Graham married to what men call a doll , than to a girl with ideas which are distasteful to women . ”
189956	189969	189970	189971	the Duchess	1935	“ How well my dear aunt divined what is weakest in me ! ”
189975	189998	189970	189971	the Duchess	1935	“ Miss Asterisk dines here to - morrow ; pray come ; you would like her if you knew more of her . ”
189999	190038	189970	189971	the Duchess	1935	“ To - morrow I am engaged — an American friend of mine dines with me ; but ‘ tis no matter , for I shall never feel more for Miss Asterisk than I feel for Mont Blanc . ”
190373	190379	190380	190380	she	454	“ to be talked about ! ”
190431	190459	190493	190493	Bevil	806	“ Well met , my dear Vane ! I see we are bound to the same place ; there will be a good gathering to - night . ”
190460	190480	190493	190493	Bevil	806	“ What do you mean , Bevil ? I am going nowhere , except to my own quiet rooms . ”
190481	190492	190493	190493	Bevil	806	“ Pooh ! Come in here at least for a few minutes,”—and
190563	190605	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ I have just come from Paris , and can give you the last news , literary , political , and social . By the way , I saw Savarin the other night at the Cicogna’s — he introduced me there . ”
190652	190664	190645	190645	Bevil	806	“ So you met Savarin ? Where , did you say ? ”
190665	190693	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ At the house of the new lady - author — I hate the word authoress — Mademoiselle Cicogna ! Of course you have read her book ? ”
190694	190697	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ Yes . ”
190698	190742	190645	190645	Bevil	806	“ Full of fine things , is it not?—though somewhat highflown and sentimental : however , nothing succeeds like success . No book has been more talked about at Paris : the only thing more talked about is the lady - author herself . ”
190743	190749	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ Indeed , and how ? ”
190750	190869	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ She does n’t look twenty , a mere girl — of that kind of beauty which so arrests the eye that you pass by other faces to gaze on it , and the dullest stranger would ask , ‘ Who , and what is she ? ’ A girl , I say , like that — who lives as independently as if she were a middle - aged widow , receives every week ( she has her Thursdays ) , with no other chaperon than an old ci - devant Italian singing woman , dressed like a guy — must set Parisian tongues into play even if she had not written the crack book of the season . ”
190870	190980	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ Mademoiselle Cicogna receives on Thursdays,—no harm in that ; and if she have no other chaperon than the Italian lady you mention , it is because Mademoiselle Cicogna is an orphan , and having a fortune , such as it is , of her own , I do not see why she should not live as independently as many an unmarried woman in London placed under similar circumstances . I suppose she receives chiefly persons in the literary or artistic world , and if they are all as respectable as the Savarins , I do not think ill - nature itself could find fault with her social circle . ”
190981	191025	190645	190645	Bevil	806	“ Ah ! you know the Cicogna , I presume . I am sure I did not wish to say anything that could offend her best friends , only I do think it is a pity she is not married , poor girl ! ”
191026	191057	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ Mademoiselle Cicogna , accomplished , beautiful , of good birth ( the Cicogna ’s rank among the oldest of Lombard families ) , is not likely to want offers . ”
191058	191150	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ Offers of marriage,—h’m — well , I dare say , from authors and artists . You know Paris better even than I do , but I do n’t suppose authors and artists there make the most desirable husbands ; and I scarcely know a marriage in France between a man - author and lady - author which does not end in the deadliest of all animosities — that of wounded amour propre . Perhaps the man admires his own genius too much to do proper homage to his wife ’s . ”
191151	191178	190645	190645	Bevil	806	“ But the choice of Mademoiselle Cicogna need not be restricted to the pale of authorship — doubtless she has many admirers beyond that quarrelsome borderland . ”
191179	191196	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ Certainly - countless adorers . Enguerrand de Vandemar — you know that diamond of dandies ? ”
191197	191205	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ Perfectly — is he an admirer ? ”
191206	191317	190645	190645	Bevil	806	“ Cela va sans dire — he told me that though she was not the handsomest woman in Paris , all other women looked less handsome since he had seen her . But , of course , French lady - killers like Enguerrand , when it comes to marriage , leave it to their parents to choose their wives and arrange the terms of the contract . Talking of lady - killers , I beheld amid the throng at Mademoiselle Cicogna ’s the ci - devant Lovelace whom I remember some twenty - three years ago as the darling of wives and the terror of husbands - Victor de Mauleon . ”
191318	191333	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ Victor de Mauleon at Mademoiselle Cicogna’s!—what , is that man restored to society ? ”
191334	191468	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ Ah ! you are thinking of the ugly old story about the jewels — oh , yes , he has got over that ; all his grand relations , the Vandemars , Beauvilliers , Rochebriant , and others , took him by the hand when he reappeared at Paris last year ; and though I believe he is still avoided by many , he is courted by still more — and avoided , I fancy , rather from political than social causes . The Imperialist set , of course , execrate and prescribe him . You know he is the writer of those biting articles signed Pierre Firmin in the Sens Commun ; and I am told he is the proprietor of that very clever journal , which has become a power . ”
191469	191506	190645	190645	Bevil	806	“ So , so — that is the journal in which Mademoiselle Cicogna ’s roman first appeared . So , so — Victor de Mauleon one of her associates , her counsellor and friend — ah ! ”
191507	191635	190645	190645	Bevil	806	“ No , I did n’t say that ; on the contrary , he was presented to her the first time the evening I was at the house . I saw that young silk - haired coxcomb , Gustave Rameau , introduce him to her . You do n’t perhaps know Rameau , editor of the Sens Commun — writes poems and criticisms . They say he is a Red Republican , but De Mauleon keeps truculent French politics subdued if not suppressed in his cynical journal . Somebody told me that the Cicogna is very much in love with Rameau ; certainly he has a handsome face of his own , and that is the reason why she was so rude to the Russian Prince X——- . ”
191636	191647	190560	190560	Bevil	806	“ How rude ! Did the Prince propose to her ? ”
191648	191695	190645	190645	Bevil	806	“ Propose ! you forget — he is married . Do n’t you know the Princess ? Still there are other kinds of proposals than those of marriage which a rich Russian prince may venture to make to a pretty novelist brought up for the stage . ”
191696	191699	191701	191701	Graham	378	“ Bevil ! ”
191710	191715	191701	191701	Graham	378	“ how dare you ? ”
191716	191721	191723	191723	Bevil	806	“ My dear boy , ”
191729	191784	191723	191723	Bevil	806	“ I really did not know that your interest in the young lady was so great . If I have wounded you in relating a mere on dit picked up at the Jockey Club , I beg you a thousand pardons . I dare say there was not a word of truth in it . ”
191785	191926	191928	191928	He	5862	“ Not a word of truth , you may be sure , if the on dit was injurious to Mademoiselle Cicogna . It is true , I have a strong interest in her ; any man — any gentleman — would have such interest in a girl so brilliant and seemingly so friendless . It shames one of human nature to think that the reward which the world makes to those who elevate its platitudes , brighten its dulness , delight its leisure , is Slander ! I have had the honour to make the acquaintance of this lady before she became a ‘ celebrity , ’ and I have never met in my paths through life a purer heart or a nobler nature . What is the wretched on dit you condescend to circulate ? Permit me to add : “
191938	191939	191928	191928	He	5862	” “
191948	191961	191946	191946	Vane	378	” said Bevil seriously ( he did not want for spirit ) , “
192033	192047	192048	192048	I	0	” Graham ’s cheek , before ashen pale , flushed into dark red . “
192052	192057	192050	192050	you	378	” he said quietly , “
192067	192068	192048	192048	I	0	” “
192072	192080	192069	192070	Graham Vane	378	” replied Bevil , with much dignity , “
192274	192275	192278	192278	you	378	” “
192312	192313	192319	192319	your	378	” “
192554	192654	192680	192681	the man	8507	” A few days after the date of the last chapter , Colonel Morley returned to Paris . He had dined with Graham at Greenwich , had met him afterwards in society , and paid him a farewell visit on the day before the Colonel ’s departure ; but the name of Isaura Cicogna had not again been uttered by either . Morley was surprised that his wife did not question him minutely as to the mode in which he had executed her delicate commission , and the manner as well as words with which Graham had replied to his “
192657	192670	192671	192671	I	0	” But his Lizzy cut him short when he began his recital : “
192705	192706	192683	192683	He	8507	” “
192736	192737	192728	192728	you	5893	” “
192763	192787	192861	192861	Isaura	454	” But when the Colonel had retired to what the French call the cabinet de traivail — and which he more accurately termed his “
192789	192854	192855	192856	Poor Isaura	454	den”—and there indulged in the cigar which , despite his American citizenship , was forbidden in the drawing - room of the tyrant who ruled his life , Mrs. Morley took from her desk a letter received three days before , and brooded over it intently , studying every word . When she had thus reperused it , her tears fell upon the page . “
192858	192860	192861	192861	Isaura	454	” she muttered—“poor
192914	192954	192973	192974	Chere enfant	874	” Then she mechanically folded up the letter — I need not say it was from Graham Vane — restored it to the desk , and remained musing till the Colonel looked in at the door and said peremptorily , “
192962	192972	192973	192974	Chere enfant	874	” The next day Madame Savarin called on Isaura . “
192976	192980	192973	192974	Chere enfant	874	” said she , “
193009	193010	193011	193011	I	0	” “
193016	193025	193011	193011	I	0	” said Isaura , in earnest tender tones ; “
193040	193041	193034	193034	he	5894	” “
193074	193075	193069	193069	me	0	” “
193085	193121	193076	193076	I	0	” said Isaura , somewhat conscience - stricken . Wrapt in her own happy thoughts , she would not have noticed change in faces yet more familiar to her than that of her young admirer . “
193124	193129	193122	193122	Isaura	454	” said Madame Savarin , “
193169	193170	193164	193164	you	454	” “
193189	193190	193185	193185	I	0	” “
193197	193198	193199	193199	I	0	” “
193233	193234	193235	193235	I	0	” “
193783	193830	193739	193739	he	1431	” Here Isaura could no longer restrain her emotions ; she burst into sobs so vehement , so convulsive , that Madame Savarin became alarmed ; but when she attempted to embrace and soothe her , Isaura recoiled with a visible shudder , and gasping out , “
193835	194125	193739	193739	he	1431	” turned to the door , and rushed to her own room . A few minutes afterwards a maid entered the salon with a message to Madame Savarin that Mademoiselle was so unwell that she must beg Madame to excuse her return to the salon . Later in the day Mrs. Morley called , but Isaura would not see her . Meanwhile poor Rameau was stretched on his sick - bed , and in sharp struggle between life and death . It is difficult to disentangle , one by one , all the threads in a nature so complex as Rameau ’s ; but if we may hazard a conjecture , the grief of disappointed love was not the immediate cause of his illness , and yet it had much to do with it . The goad of Isaura ’s refusal had driven him into seeking distraction in excesses which a stronger frame could not have courted with impunity . The man was thoroughly Parisian in many things , but especially in impatience of any trouble . Did love trouble him — love could be drowned in absinthe ; and too much absinthe may be a more immediate cause of congested lungs than the love which the absinthe had lulled to sleep . His bedside was not watched by hirelings . When first taken thus ill — too ill to attend to his editorial duties — information was conveyed to the publisher of the Sens Commun , and in consequence of that information , Victor de Mauleon came to see the sick man . By his bed he found Savarin , who had called , as it were by chance , and seen the doctor , who had said , “
194136	194143	194148	194150	a professional nurse	5934	” Savarin whispered to De Mauleon , “
194158	194168	194169	194169	Somebody	4893	” De Mauleon replied , also in a whisper , “
194179	194302	194169	194169	Somebody	4893	” It was true — Savarin had forgotten it . Rameau never mentioned his parents — he was not proud of them . They belonged to a lower class of the bourgeoisie , retired shopkeepers , and a Red Republican is sworn to hate of the bourgeoisie , high or low ; while a beautiful young author pushing his way into the Chaussee d’Antin does not proclaim to the world that his parents had sold hosiery in the Rue St. Denis . Nevertheless Savarin knew that Rameau had such parents still living , and took the hint . Two hours afterwards Rameau was leaning his burning forehead on his mother ’s breast . The next morning the doctor said to the mother , “
194321	194322	194315	194315	we	5941	” “
194328	194367	194315	194315	we	5941	” cried indignantly the poor mother . The day which had inflicted on Isaura so keen an anguish was marked by a great trial in the life of Alain de Rochebriant . In the morning he received the notice “
194376	194433	194434	194434	he	5942	” on the part of his creditor , M. Louvier ; in plain English , an announcement that his property at Rochebriant would be put up to public sale on a certain day , in case all debts due to the mortgagee were not paid before . An hour afterwards came a note from Duplessis stating that “
194465	194469	194434	194434	he	5942	” Alain put the “
194471	194496	194497	194497	I	0	” into his pocket , and repaired to the Hotel Duplessis . The financier received him with very cordial civility . Then he began : “
194568	194569	194570	194570	I	0	” “
194596	194597	194590	194594	an antiquarian enamoured of ruins	5951	” “
194684	194685	194687	194688	M. Louvier	399	” “
194693	194719	194687	194688	M. Louvier	399	” said Alain , with a somewhat melancholy smile , extending to Duplessis the menacing notice . Duplessis glanced at it , and said drily : “
195181	195220	195221	195221	You	5958	” Alain turned his head aside to conceal his emotion , and then , with the quick affectionate impulse of the genuine French nature , threw himself on the financier ’s breast and kissed him on both cheeks . “
195265	195273	195274	195274	I	0	” he hurried on in broken words , “
195307	195320	195299	195300	a father	1431	” Moved as Alain was , Duplessis was moved yet more deeply . “
195341	195371	195372	195373	Monsieur Louvier	474	” he said softly . Then , quickly recovering his wonted composure , he added , with the sardonic smile which often chilled his friends and alarmed his foes , “
195435	195512	195518	195518	I	0	” I need not say that Alain accepted the invitation . How happy Valerie was that evening ! The next day Duplessis was surprised by a visit from M. Louvier — that magnate of millionaires had never before set foot in the house of his younger and less famous rival . The burly man entered the room with a face much flushed , and with more than his usual mixture of jovial brusquerie and opulent swagger . “
195522	195534	195518	195518	I	0	” began Louvier , as soon as the door was closed . “

196364	196376	196353	196354	Monsieur Louvier	474	” And Louvier strode to the door ; here he paused : “

196389	196390	196391	196392	Your servant	6019	” “
196399	196415	196394	196397	Monsieur,—your very humble servant	6020	” Louvier vanished . Duplessis leaned his large thoughtful forehead on his thin nervous hand . “

196459	196563	196567	196567	she	6022	” Madame Savarin wrote a very kind and very apologetic letter to Isaura , but no answer was returned to it . Madame Savarin did not venture to communicate to her husband the substance of a conversation which had ended so painfully . He had , in theory , a delicacy of tact , which , if he did not always exhibit it in practice , made him a very severe critic of its deficiency in others . Therefore , unconscious of the offence given , he made a point of calling at Isaura ’s apartments , and leaving word with her servant that “
196584	196665	196573	196574	M. Rameau	551	” It was not till the third day after her interview with Madame Savarin that Isaura left her own room,—she did so to receive Mrs. Morley . The fair American was shocked to see the change in Isaura ’s countenance . She was very pale , and with that indescribable appearance of exhaustion which betrays continued want of sleep ; her soft eyes were dim , the play of her lips was gone , her light step weary and languid . “
196670	196678	196573	196574	M. Rameau	551	” cried Mrs. Morley , embracing her , “
196692	196693	196694	196694	I	0	” “
196726	196835	196837	196839	Mr. Graham Vane	378	” Therewith Mrs. Morley ran glibly through the principal topics of the hour : the breach threatened between M. Ollivier and his former liberal partisans ; the tone unexpectedly taken by M. de Girardin ; the speculations as to the result of the trial of the alleged conspirators against the Emperor ’s life , which was fixed to take place towards the end of that month of June,—all matters of no slight importance to the interests of an empire . Sunk deep into the recesses of her fauteuil , Isaura seemed to listen quietly , till , when a pause came , she said in cold clear tones : “
196847	196848	196854	196854	he	378	” “
196864	196865	196857	196857	he	378	” “
196872	196882	196866	196866	I	0	” said Isaura , with a low bitter laugh . “

197088	197144	197081	197081	Money	882	” Isaura paused , pressing her hands tightly together ; then she suddenly rose to her feet , the colour on her cheek mantling and receding rapidly , and fixing on her startled visitor eyes no longer dim , but with something half fierce , half imploring in the passion of their gaze , said : “
197183	197184	197177	197177	I	0	” “

197218	197233	197213	197214	a woman	1546	” Mrs. Morley had come prepared to carry out the resolution she had formed and “
197235	197238	197200	197200	Child!—no	883	” to Isaura “
197242	197290	197200	197200	Child!—no	883	” that which the girl now demanded . But then she had meant to break the truth in her own gentle , gradual way . Thus suddenly called upon , her courage failed her . She burst into tears . Isaura gazed at her dry - eyed . “
197340	197341	197336	197336	he	378	” “
197415	197475	197476	197476	I	0	” And Mrs. Morley drew forth and thrust into Isaura ’s hands the letter she had concealed from her husband . The letter was not very long ; it began with expressions of warm gratitude to Mrs. Morley , not for her invitation only , but for the interest she had conceived in his happiness . It went on thus “
197512	197567	197568	197568	He	6043	“ No one can feel more sensible than I of the charm of so exquisite a loveliness ; no one can more sincerely join in the belief that the praise which greets the commencement of her career is but the whisper of the praise that will cheer its progress with louder and louder plaudits . “
197808	197859	197887	197887	she	454	“ And yet not even the jealous tyranny of man ’s love could dare to say to natures like hers of whom we speak , ‘ Limit to the household glory of one the light which genius has placed in its firmament for the use and enjoyment of all . ’ ”
197860	197867	197869	197869	Isaura	454	“ I thank you so much , ”
197873	197885	197869	197869	Isaura	454	“ suspense makes a woman so weak — certainty so strong . ”
197912	197922	197924	197925	Mrs. Morley	462	“ Nay , will you not keep it yourself ? ”
197927	198009	197924	197925	Mrs. Morley	462	“ The more you examine the narrow - minded prejudices , the English arrogant man ’s jealous dread of superiority — nay , of equality — in the woman he ‘ can only value as he does his house or his horse , because she is his exclusive property , the more you will be rejoiced to find yourself free for a more worthy choice . Keep the letter ; read it till you feel for the writer forgiveness and disdain . ”
198051	198175	198045	198046	Mrs. Morley	462	“ He was so pleased when he learned that I renounced the career on which I had set my ambition . I thought he would have been so pleased when I sought in another career to raise myself nearer to his level — I see now how sadly I was mistaken . All that perplexed me before in him is explained . I did not guess how foolishly I had deceived myself till three days ago,—then I did guess it ; and it was that guess which tortured me so terribly that I could not keep my heart to myself when I saw you to - day ; in spite of all womanly pride it would force its way — to the truth . “

198604	198610	198600	198600	you	6055	” she then asked dreamily , “
198779	198780	198782	198782	you	6055	” “
198794	198806	198782	198782	you	6055	” said Mrs. Morley , with a woman ’s kindly tact . “

198837	198872	198782	198782	you	6055	“ And now — kiss me , dearest — never a word again to me about this conversation : never a word about Mr. Vane — the dark curtain has fallen on the past . ”

199701	199709	199710	199710	he	2459	“ Look you , my young friend , ”
199715	199848	199710	199710	he	2459	“ mere brain - work seldom kills a man once accustomed to it like you ; but heart - work , and stomach - work , and nerve - work , added to brain - work , may soon consign to the coffin a frame ten times more robust than yours . Write as much as you will — that is your vocation ; but it is not your vocation to drink absinthe — to preside at orgies in the Maison Doree . Regulate yourself , and not after the fashion of the fabulous Don Juan . Marry — live soberly and quietly — and you may survive the grandchildren of viveurs . Go on as you have done , and before the year is out you are in Pere la Chaise . ”
199974	199977	199978	199978	he	551	“ Ah , ”
199984	200008	199978	199978	he	551	“ that girl Isaura can have no true sympathy with genius ! It is no ordinary man that she will kill in me ! ”
200091	200109	200079	200079	Isaura	454	“ Ah ! with Isaura how changed would be his habits ! how pure ! how healthful ! ”
200167	200174	200175	200175	he	551	“ She could not do less , ”
200178	200185	200175	200175	he	551	“ Has no one offered to do more?”—he
200425	200545	200422	200422	she	386	“ Yes — a young lady calling herself Mademoiselle Julie Caumartin wished to instal herself here as your nurse . When I said , ‘ But I am his mother — he needs no other nurses , ’ she would have retreated , and looked ashamed — poor thing ! I do n’t blame her if she loved my son . But , my son , I say this,—if you love her , do n’t talk to me about that Mademoiselle Cicogna ; and if you love Mademoiselle Cicogna , why , then your father will take care that the poor girl who loved you not knowing that you loved another is not left to the temptation of penury . ”
200708	200750	200701	200701	He	6138	“ Do n’t trouble your head about Mademoiselle Caumartin ; she is in no want of money . Of course , if I could hope for Isaura — but , alas ! I dare not hope . Give me my tisane . ”
200775	200811	200772	200772	he	2474	“ We are not getting on so well as I had hoped ; the fever is gone , but there is much to apprehend from the debility left behind . His spirits are sadly depressed . ”
200849	200997	201015	201015	she	2732	“ Ca n’t you think of any bit of good news — that ‘ M. Thiers raves about your son ’s last poem ! that ‘ it is a question among the Academicians between him and Jules Janin’—or that ‘ the beautiful Duchesse de — — — - has been placed in a lunatic asylum because she has gone mad for love of a certain young Red Republican whose name begins with R.’—can’t you think of any bit of similar good news ? If you can , it will be a tonic to the relaxed state of your dear boy ’s amour propre , compared to which all the drugs in the Pharmacopoeia are moonshine and water ; and meanwhile be sure to remove him to your own house , and out of the reach of his giddy young friends , as soon as you possibly can . ”
201018	201025	201015	201015	she	2732	“ The boy shall be saved . ”
201164	201177	201160	201161	the Venosta	854	“ The husband ’s perfidy reveals itself on a wife ’s face , ”

201205	201247	201194	201195	the visitor	8362	“ Pardon my intrusion - my son has the honour to be known to you . Every one who knows him must share in my sorrow — so young — so promising , and in such danger — my poor boy ! ”
201416	201427	201412	201412	she	386	“ May I speak to you a few minutes alone ? ”
201505	201589	201484	201485	Madame Rameau	386	“ No wonder you are so loved — yours is the beauty that sinks into the hearts and rests there . I prize my boy more , now that I have seen you . But , oh , Mademoiselle ! pardon me — do not withdraw your hand — pardon the mother who comes from the sick - bed of her only son and asks if you will assist to save him ! A word from you is life or death to him ! ”
201590	201622	201623	201623	she	6174	“ Nay , nay , do not speak thus , Madame ; your son knows how much I value , how sincerely I return , his friendship ; but — but , ”
201634	201647	201623	201623	she	6174	eyes—“I have no heart to give to him - to any one . ”
201648	201730	201484	201485	Madame Rameau	386	“ I do not — I would not if I dared — ask what it would be violence to yourself to promise . I do not ask you to bid me return to my son and say , ‘ Hope and recover , ’ but let me take some healing message from your lips . If I understand your words rightly , I at least may say that you do not give to another the hopes you , deny to him ? ”
201731	201788	201790	201790	Isaura	454	“ So far you understand me rightly , Madame . It has been said , that romance - writers give away so much of their hearts to heroes or heroines of their own creation , that they leave nothing worth the giving to human beings like themselves . Perhaps it is so ; yet , Madame , ”
201802	201813	201790	201790	Isaura	454	“ I have heart enough left to feel for you . ”
201819	201969	201814	201815	Madame Rameau	386	“ Ah , Mademoiselle , I do not believe in the saying you have quoted . But I must not abuse your goodness by pressing further upon you subjects from which you shrink . Only one word more : you know that my husband and I are but quiet tradesfolks , not in the society , nor aspiring to it , to which my son ’s talents have raised himself ; yet dare I ask that you will not close here the acquaintance that I have obtruded on you?—dare I ask , that I may , now and then , call on you — that now and then I may see you at my own home ? Believe that I would not here ask anything which your own mother would disapprove if she overlooked disparities of station . Humble as our home is , slander never passed its threshold . ”
201970	202006	201484	201485	Madame Rameau	386	“ Ah , Madame , I and the Signora Venosta , whom in our Italian tongue I call mother , can but feel honoured and grateful whenever it pleases you to receive visits from us . ”
202007	202332	201814	201815	Madame Rameau	386	“ It would be a base return for such gracious compliance with my request if I concealed from you the reason why I pray Heaven to bless you for that answer . The physician says that it may be long before my son is sufficiently convalescent to dispense with a mother ’s care , and resume his former life and occupation in the great world . It is everything for us if we can coax him into coming under our own roof - tree . This is difficult to do . It is natural for a young man launched into the world to like his own chez lui . Then what will happen to Gustave ? He , lonely and heart - stricken , will ask friends , young as himself , but far stronger , to come and cheer him ; or he will seek to distract his thoughts by the overwork of his brain ; in either case he is doomed . But I have stronger motives yet to fix him a while at our hearth . This is just the moment , once lost never to be regained , when soothing companionship , gentle reproachless advice , can fix him lastingly in the habits and modes of life which will banish all fears of his future from the hearts of his parents . You at least honour him with friendship , with kindly interest — you at least would desire to wean him from all that a friend may disapprove or lament — a creature whom Providence meant to be good , and perhaps great . If I say to him , ‘ It will be long before you can go out and see your friends , but at my house your friends shall come and see you — among them Signora Venosta and Mademoiselle Cicogna will now and then drop in’—my victory is gained , and my son is saved . ”
202333	202336	202338	202338	Isaura	454	“ Madame , ”
202343	202399	202338	202338	Isaura	454	“ what a blessing to have a mother like you ! Love so noble ennobles those who hear its voice . Tell your son how ardently I wish him to be well , and to fulfil more than the promise of his genius ; tell him also this — how I envy him his mother . ”
202881	202884	202886	202886	their	6200	“ Ay , ”
202889	202890	202886	202886	their	6200	“ No”?—thou
203079	203087	203077	203077	herself	454	“ What has happened?—what have I done ? ”
203197	203204	203217	203217	she	454	“ to know something about politics . ”
203221	203226	203217	203217	she	454	“ to know something about ”
203334	203425	203331	203331	I	0	“ MONSIEUR,—I am happy to inform you that I have at last obtained one piece of information which may lead to a more important discovery . When we parted after our fruitless research in Vienna , we had both concurred in the persuasion that , for some reason known only to the two ladies themselves , Madame Marigny and Madame Duval had exchanged names — that it was Madame Marigny who had deceased in the name of Madame Duval , and Madame Duval who had survived in that of Marigny . “
203570	203617	203618	203618	I	0	“ Therefore , dismissing all attempts at further trace of the missing lady , I resolved to return to Vienna as soon as the business that recalled me to Paris was concluded , and devote myself exclusively to the search after the amorous and mysterious Monsieur . “
203663	203690	203625	203625	you	6223	“ One thing was clear , that , at the time of the soi - disant Duval ’s decease , the beau Monsieur was at Vienna . “
203764	203849	203850	203853	A man of intrigue	6228	“ I could not , however , get permission to absent myself from Paris for the time I might require till the end of last April . I had meanwhile sought all private means of ascertaining what Frenchmen of rank and station were in that capital in the autumn of 1849 . Among the list of the very few such Messieurs I fixed upon one as the most likely to be the mysterious Achille — Achille was , indeed , his nom de bapteme . “
204305	204366	204367	204367	Our	6257	“ By little and little , however , in the course of two or three evenings , and by the aid of many flasks of Orviette or bottles of Lacrima ( wines , Monsieur , that I do not commend to any one who desires to keep his stomach sound and his secrets safe ) , I gathered these particulars . “
204402	204699	204706	204706	Leporello	890	“ But happening to visit that capital of Europe a few months before we come to our dates at Aix - la - Chapelle , he made acquaintance with Madame Marigny , a natural daughter of high - placed parents , by whom , of course , she had never been acknowledged , but who had contrived that she should receive a good education at a convent ; and on leaving it also contrived that an old soldier of fortune — which means an officer without fortune — who had served in Algiers with some distinction , should offer her his hand , and add the modest dot they assigned her to his yet more modest income . They contrived also that she should understand the offer must be accepted . Thus Mademoiselle ‘ Quelque Chose ’ became Madame Marigny , and she , on her part , contrived that a year or so later she should be left a widow . After a marriage , of course the parents washed their hands of her — they had done their duty . At the time Don Juan made this lady ’s acquaintance nothing could be said against her character ; but the milliners and butchers had begun to imply that they would rather have her money than trust to her character . Don Juan fell in love with her , satisfied the immediate claims of milliner and butcher , and when they quitted Paris it was agreed that they should meet later at Aix - la - Chapelle . But when he resorted to that sultry and , to my mind , unalluring spa , he was surprised by a line from her saying that she had changed her name of Marigny for that of Duval . “
204836	205002	204823	204823	he	6262	“ Leporello remembered very little of what followed . All he did remember is that Don Juan , when at Vienna , said to him one morning , looking less gay than usual , ‘ It is finished with ca petite Marigny - she is no more . ’ Then he ordered his bath , wrote a note , and said with tears in his eyes , ‘ Take this to Mademoiselle Celeste ; not to be compared to la petite Marigny ; but la petite Celeste is still alive . ’ Ah , Monsieur ! if only any man in France could be as proud of his ruler as that Italian was of my countrymen ! Alas ! we Frenchmen are all made to command — or at least we think ourselves so — and we are insulted by one who says to us , ‘ Serve and obey . ’ Nowadays , in France , we find all Don Juans and no Leporellos . “
205060	205190	205048	205048	he	890	“ ‘ On the day that his Excellency,’—Leporello generally so styled his master—‘Excellency , ’ as you are aware , is the title an Italian would give to Satan if taking his wages , told me that la petite Marigny was no more , he had received previously a lady veiled and mantled , whom I did not recognise as any one I had seen before , but I noticed her way of carrying herself — haughtily — her head thrown back ; and I thought to myself , that lady is one of his grandes dames . She did call again two or three times , never announcing her name ; then she did not reappear . She might be Madame Duval — I ca n’t say . ’ “
205209	205223	205048	205048	he	890	“ ‘ No — non mi ricordo — I do n’t remember . ’ “
205240	205323	205048	205048	he	890	“ ‘ Stop , I do recollect ; not that he ever named such a person to me , but that I have posted letters for him to a Madame Marigny — oh , yes ! even years after the said petite Marigny was dead ; and once I did venture to say , ‘ Pardon me , Eccellenza , but may I ask if that poor lady is really dead , since I have to prepay this letter to her ? ’ ”
205324	205402	205048	205048	he	890	“ ‘ Oh , ’ said he , ‘ Madame Marigny ! Of course the one you know is dead , but there are others of the same name ; this lady is of my family . Indeed , her house , though noble in itself , recognises the representative of mine as its head , and I am too bon prince not to acknowledge and serve any one who branches out of my own tree . ’ ”
205403	205484	205048	205048	he	890	“ A day after this last conversation on the subject , Leporello said to me : ‘ My friend , you certainly have some interest in ascertaining what became of the lady who took the name of Marigny ( I state this frankly , Monsieur , to show how difficult even for one so prudent as I am to beat about a bush long but what you let people know the sort of bird you are in search of ) . “
205538	205584	205490	205490	I	0	“ ‘ I can put you on the way of learning all that his Excellency was likely to have known of her through correspondence . I have often heard him quote , with praise , a saying so clever that it might have been Italian , “
205591	205646	205490	205490	I	0	” that is , never commit yourself by a letter — keep all letters that could put others in your power . All the letters he received were carefully kept and labelled . I sent them to his son in four large trunks . His son , no doubt , has them still . ’ “
205683	205864	205664	205664	I	0	“ You , Monsieur , can do what I could not venture to do ; you can ask the son of Don Juan if , amid the correspondence of his father , which he may have preserved , there be any signed Marigny or Duval — any , in short , which can throw light on this very obscure complication of circumstances . A grand seigneur would naturally be more complaisant to a man of your station than he would be to an agent of police . Don Juan ’s son , inheriting his father ’s title , is Monsieur le Marquis de Rochebriant ; and permit me to add , that at this moment , as the journals doubtless inform you , all Paris resounds with the rumour of the coming war ; and Monsieur de Rochebriant — who is , as I have ascertained , now in Paris — it may be difficult to find anywhere on earth a month or two hence.—I have the honour , with profound consideration , & c. , & c. , RENARD . ”

206147	206161	206163	206163	Duplessis	361	“ It is not yet clear that France has been insulted , Messieurs , ”
206167	206194	206163	206163	Duplessis	361	“ Bah ! Not insulted ! The very nomination of a Hohenzollern to the crown of Spain was an insult — what would you have more ? ”
206195	206205	206209	206210	de Breze	514	“ I tell you what it is , Duplessis , ”
206221	206326	206163	206163	Duplessis	361	swagger—“I tell you what it is , your friend the Emperor has no more courage than a chicken . He is grown old , and infirm , and lazy ; he knows that he ca n’t even mount on horseback . But if , before this day week , he has not declared war on the Prussians , he will be lucky if he can get off as quietly as poor Louis Philippe did under shelter of his umbrella , and ticketed ‘ Schmidt . ’ Or could you not , M. Duplessis , send him back to London in a bill of exchange ? ”
206327	206340	206342	206342	Duplessis	361	“ For a man of your literary repute , M. le Vicomte , ”
206344	206390	206342	206342	Duplessis	361	“ you indulge in a strange confusion of metaphors . But , pardon me , I came here to breakfast , and I can not remain to quarrel . Come , Lemercier , let us take our chance of a cutlet at the Trois Freres . ”
206391	206396	206398	206398	Lemercier	352	“ Fox , Fox , ”

206489	206500	206502	206502	Lemercier	352	“ I would not lose Fox for a great deal , ”
206506	206530	206502	206502	Lemercier	352	“ a pledge of love and fidelity from an English lady the most distinguished : the lady left me — the dog remains . ”
206535	206650	206531	206531	Duplessis	361	“ What a thoroughbred Parisian you are , my dear Frederic ! I believe if the tramp of the last angel were sounding , the Parisians would be divided into two sets : one would be singing the Marseillaise , and parading the red flag ; the other would be shrugging their shoulders and saying , ‘ Bah ! as if le Bon Dieu would have the bad taste to injure Paris — the Seat of the Graces , the School of the Arts , the Fountain of Reason , the Eye of the World ; ’ and so be found by the destroying angel caressing poodles and making bons mots about les femmes . ”
206651	206658	206660	206660	Lemercier	352	“ And quite right , too , ”
206664	206807	206660	206660	Lemercier	352	“ what other people in the world could retain lightness of heart under circumstances so unpleasant ? But why do you take things so solemnly ? Of course there will be war idle now to talk of explanations and excuses . When a Frenchman says , ‘ I am insulted , ’ he is not going to be told that he is not insulted . He means fighting , and not apologising . But what if there be war ? Our brave soldiers beat the Prussians — take the Rhine — return to Paris covered with laurels ; a new Boulevard de Berlin eclipses the Boulevard Sebastopol . By the way , Duplessis , a Boulevard de Berlin will be a good speculation — better than the Rue de Louvier . Ah ! is not that my English friend , Grarm Varn ? ”
206828	206843	206818	206826	a gentleman who was about to pass him unnoticing	6297	“ Bon jour , mon ami ! how long have you been at Paris ? ”
206844	206851	206853	206853	Graham	378	“ I only arrived last evening , ”
206855	206890	206853	206853	Graham	378	“ and my stay will be so short that it is a piece of good luck , my dear Lemercier , to meet with you , and exchange a cordial shake of the hand . ”
206891	206911	206818	206826	a gentleman who was about to pass him unnoticing	6297	“ We are just going to breakfast at the Trois Freres — Duplessis and I — pray join us . ”
206912	206960	206961	206961	Duplessis	361	“ With great pleasure — ah , M. Duplessis , I shall be glad to hear from you that the Emperor will be firm enough to check the advances of that martial fever which , to judge by the persons I meet , seems to threaten delirium . ”
206975	207080	206971	206971	he	361	“ The English , at least , ought to know that when the Emperor by his last reforms resigned his personal authority for constitutional monarchy , it ceased to be a question whether he could or could not be firm in matters that belonged to the Cabinet and the Chambers . I presume that if Monsieur Gladstone advised Queen Victoria to declare war upon the Emperor of Russia , backed by a vast majority in Parliament , you would think me very ignorant of constitutional monarchy and Parliamentary government if I said , ‘ I hope Queen Victoria will resist that martial fever . ’ ”
207081	207157	206971	206971	he	361	“ You rebuke me very fairly , M. Duplessis , if you can show me that the two cases are analogous ; but we do not understand in England that , despite his last reforms , the Emperor has so abnegated his individual ascendency , that his will , clearly and resolutely expressed , would not prevail in his Council and silence opposition in the Chambers . Is it so ? I ask for information . ”
207176	207181	207183	207183	Duplessis	361	“ That all depends , ”
207185	207533	207183	207183	Duplessis	361	“ upon what may be the increase of popular excitement at Paris . If it slackens , the Emperor , no doubt , could turn to wise account that favourable pause in the fever . But if it continues to swell , and Paris cries , ‘ War , ’ in a voice as loud as it cried to Louis Philippe ‘ Revolution , ’ do you think that the Emperor could impose on his ministers the wisdom of peace ? His ministers would be too terrified by the clamour to undertake the responsibility of opposing it — they would resign . Where is the Emperor to find another Cabinet ? a peace Cabinet ? What and who are the orators for peace?—whom a handful!—who ? Gambetta , Jules Favre , avowed Republicans,—would they even accept the post of ministers to Louis Napoleon ? If they did , would not their first step be the abolition of the Empire ? Napoleon is therefore so far a constitutional monarch in the same sense as Queen Victoria , that the popular will in the country ( and in France in such matters Paris is the country ) controls the Chambers , controls the Cabinet ; and against the Cabinet the Emperor could not contend . I say nothing of the army — a power in France unknown to you in England , which would certainly fraternise with no peace party . If war is proclaimed,—let England blame it if she will — she ca n’t lament it more than I should : but let England blame the nation ; let her blame , if she please , the form of the government , which rests upon popular suffrage ; but do not let her blame our sovereign more than the French would blame her own , if compelled by the conditions on which she holds her crown to sign a declaration of war , which vast majorities in a Parliament just elected , and a Council of Ministers whom she could not practically replace , enforced upon her will . ”
207534	207623	207874	207874	Duplessis	361	“ Your observations , M. Duplessis , impress me strongly , and add to the deep anxieties with which , in common with all my countrymen , I regard the menacing aspect of the present hour . Let us hope the best . Our Government , I know , is exerting itself to the utmost verge of its power , to remove every just ground of offence that the unfortunate nomination of a German Prince to the Spanish throne could not fail to have given to French statesmen . ”
207624	207641	207643	207643	Lemercier	352	“ I am glad you concede that such a nomination was a just ground of offence , ”
207648	207673	207643	207643	Lemercier	352	“ for I have met Englishmen who asserted that France had no right to resent any choice of a sovereign that Spain might make . ”
207674	207687	207689	207689	Graham	378	“ Englishmen in general are not very reflective politicians in foreign affairs , ”
207691	207831	207689	207689	Graham	378	“ but those who are must see that France could not , without alarm the most justifiable , contemplate a cordon of hostile states being drawn around her on all sides,—Germany , is , itself so formidable since the field of Sadowa , on the east ; a German prince in the southwest ; the not improbable alliance between Prussia and the Italian kingdom , already so alienated from the France to which it owed so much . If England would be uneasy were a great maritime power possessed of Antwerp , how much more uneasy might France justly be if Prussia could add the armies of Spain to those of Germany , and launch them both upon France . But that cause of alarm is over — the Hohenzollern is withdrawn . Let us hope for the best . ”
207867	207872	207874	207874	Duplessis	361	“ Observe that man , ”
207885	207931	207874	207874	Duplessis	361	“ the other day he was the popular hero — now , in the excitement of threatened war , he is permitted to order his bifteck uncongratulated , uncaressed ; such is fame at Paris ! here to - day and gone to - morrow . ”
207932	207940	208067	208067	Duplessis	361	“ How did the man become famous ? ”
207941	207960	207874	207874	Duplessis	361	“ He is a painter , and refused a decoration — the only French painter who ever did . ”
207961	207966	207874	207874	Duplessis	361	“ And why refuse ? ”
207967	208022	208067	208067	Duplessis	361	“ Because he is more stared at as the man who refused than he would have been as the man who accepted . If ever the Red Republicans have their day , those among them most certain of human condemnation will be the coxcombs who have gone mad for the desire of human applause . ”
208023	208033	207874	207874	Duplessis	361	“ You are a profound philosopher , M. Duplessis . ”
208034	208066	208067	208067	Duplessis	361	“ I hope not — I have an especial contempt for philosophers . Pardon me a moment — I see a man to whom I would say a word or two . ”
208142	208210	208139	208139	Graham	378	“ Pray tell me where I can find your friend the Marquis de Rochebriant . I called at his apartment this morning , and I was told that he had gone on some visit into the country , taking his valet , and the concierge could not give me his address . I thought myself so lucky on meeting with you , who are sure to know . ”
208211	208235	208139	208139	Graham	378	“ No , I do not ; it is some days since I saw Alain . But Duplessis will be sure to know . ”
208242	208268	208237	208238	the financier	2098	“ Mon cher , Grarm Varn wants to know for what Sabine shades Rochebriant has deserted the ‘ fumum opes strepitumque ’ of the capital . ”
208269	208282	208139	208139	Graham	378	“ Ah ! the Marquis is a friend of yours , Monsieur ? ”
208283	208306	208139	208139	Graham	378	“ I can scarcely boast that honour , but he is an acquaintance whom I should be very glad to see again . ”
208307	208384	208237	208238	the financier	2098	“ At this moment he is at the Duchesse de Tarascon ’s country - house near Fontainebleau ; I had a hurried line from him two days ago stating that he was going there on her urgent invitation . But he may return to - morrow ; at all events he dines with me on the 8th , and I shall be charmed if you will do me the honour to meet him at my house . ”
208385	208404	208139	208139	Graham	378	“ It is an invitation too agreeable to refuse , and I thank you very much for it . ”
208492	208498	208499	208499	she	2213	“ Ah , Mr. Vane ! ”
208503	208518	208499	208499	she	2213	joyfully—“you are then at Paris , though you have not come to see me . ”
208519	208530	208532	208532	Graham	378	“ I only arrived last night , dear Mrs. Morley , ”
208537	208558	208499	208499	she	2213	“ and only on some matters of business which unexpectedly summoned me . My stay will probably be very short . ”
208559	208617	208499	208499	she	2213	“ In that case let me rob you of a few minutes — no , not rob you even of them ; I can take you wherever you want to go , and as my carriage moves more quickly than you do on foot , I shall save you the minutes instead of robbing you of them . ”
208618	208638	208499	208499	she	2213	“ You are most kind , but I was only going to my hotel , which is close by . ”
208639	208660	208499	208499	she	2213	“ Then you have no excuse for not taking a short drive with me in the Champs Elysees — come . ”
208686	208715	208681	208681	himself	378	“ Mr. Vane , I feel as if I had many apologies to make for the interest in your life which my letter to you so indiscreetly betrayed . ”
208716	208733	208499	208499	she	2213	“ Oh , Mrs. Morley ! you can not guess how deeply that interest touched me . ”
208734	208743	208745	208746	Mrs. Morley	462	“ I should not have presumed so far , ”
208752	208999	208745	208746	Mrs. Morley	462	“ if I had not been altogether in error as to the nature of your sentiments in a certain quarter . In this you must blame my American rearing . With us there are many flirtations between boys and girls which come to nothing ; but when in my country a man like you meets with a woman like Mademoiselle Cicogna , there can not be flirtation . His attentions , his looks , his manner , reveal to the eyes of those who care enough for him to watch , one of two things — either he coldly admires and esteems , or he loves with his whole heart and soul a woman worthy to inspire such a love . Well , I did watch , and I was absurdly mistaken . I imagined that I saw love , and rejoiced for the sake of both of you to think so . I know that in all countries , our own as well as yours , love is so morbidly sensitive and jealous that it is always apt to invent imaginary foes to itself . Esteem and admiration never do that . I thought that some misunderstanding , easily removed by the intervention of a third person , might have impeded the impulse of two hearts towards each other — and so I wrote . I had assumed that you loved — I am humbled to the last degree — you only admired and esteemed . ”
209000	209019	208499	208499	she	2213	“ Your irony is very keen , Mrs. Morley , and to you it may seem very just . ”
209020	209058	208499	208499	she	2213	“ Do n’t call me Mrs. Morley in that haughty tone of voice,—can’t you talk to me as you would talk to a friend ? You only esteemed and admired — there is an end of it . ”
209059	209070	209072	209072	Graham	378	“ No , there is not an end of it , ”
209096	209180	208499	208499	she	2213	“ the end of it to me is a life out of which is ever stricken such love as I could feel for woman . To me true love can only come once . It came with my first look on that fatal face — it has never left me in thought by day , in dreams by night . The end of it to me is farewell to all such happiness as the one love of a life can promise — but — ”
209181	209185	209187	209188	Mrs. Morley	462	“ But what ? ”
209207	209210	209211	209211	he	378	“ But , ”
209218	209264	209211	209211	he	378	“ we Englishmen are trained to the resistance of absolute authority ; we can not submit all the elements that make up our being to the sway of a single despot . Love is the painter of existence , it should not be its sculptor . ”
209265	209273	209187	209188	Mrs. Morley	462	“ I do not understand the metaphor . ”
209274	209287	209211	209211	he	378	“ Love colours our life , it should not chisel its form . ”
209288	209369	209211	209211	he	378	“ My dear Mr. Vane , that is very cleverly said , but the human heart is too large and too restless to be quietly packed up in an aphorism . Do you mean to tell me that if you found you had destroyed Isaura Cicogna ’s happiness as well as resigned your own , that thought would not somewhat deform the very shape you would give to your life ? Is it colour alone that your life would lose ? ”
209370	209567	209187	209188	Mrs. Morley	462	“ Ah , Mrs. Morley , do not lower your friend into an ordinary girl in whom idleness exaggerates the strength of any fancy over which it dreamily broods . Isaura Cicogna has her occupations — her genius — her fame — her career . Honestly speaking , I think that in these she will find a happiness that no quiet hearth could bestow . I will say no more . I feel persuaded that were we two united I could not make her happy . With the irresistible impulse that urges the genius of the writer towards its vent in public sympathy and applause , she would chafe if I said , ‘ Be contented to be wholly mine . ’ And if I said it not , and felt I had no right to say it , and allowed the full scope to her natural ambition , what then ? She would chafe yet more to find that I had no fellowship in her aims and ends — that where I should feel pride , I felt humiliation . It would be so ; I can not help it , ‘ tis my nature . ”
209568	209601	209602	209602	Graham	378	“ So be it then . When , next year perhaps , you visit Paris , you will be safe from my officious interference ! Isaura will be the wife of another . ”
209631	209636	209637	209637	he	378	“ I told you , ”
209641	209676	209637	209637	he	378	“ that your fears of my influence over the happiness of one so gifted , and so strong in such gifts , were groundless ; you allow that I should be very soon forgotten ? ”
209677	209764	209187	209188	Mrs. Morley	462	“ I allow no such thing — I wish I could . But do you know so little of a woman ’s heart ( and in matters of heart , I never yet heard that genius had a talisman against emotion),—do you know so little of a woman ’s heart as not to know that the very moment in which she may accept a marriage the least fitted to render her happy , is that in which she has lost all hope of happiness in another ? ”
209765	209771	209637	209637	he	378	“ Is it indeed so ? ”
209773	209780	209637	209637	he	378	Graham—“Ay , I can conceive it . ”
209781	209994	209187	209188	Mrs. Morley	462	“ And have you so little comprehension of the necessities which that fame , that career to which you allow she is impelled by the instincts of genius , impose on this girl , young , beautiful , fatherless , motherless ? No matter how pure her life , can she guard it from the slander of envious tongues ? Will not all her truest friends — would not you , if you were her brother — press upon her by all the arguments that have most weight with the woman who asserts independence in her modes of life , and yet is wise enough to know that the world can only judge of virtue by its shadow — reputation , not to dispense with the protection which a husband can alone secure ? And that is why I warn you , if it be yet time , that in resigning your own happiness you may destroy Isaura ’s . She will we d another , but she will not be happy . What a chimera or dread your egotism as man conjures up ! Oh ! forsooth , the qualities that charm and delight a world are to unfit a woman to be helpmate to a man . Fie on you!—fie ! ”
210044	210050	210052	210052	Enguerrand	564	“ Pardon , Madame Morley , ”
210054	210201	210052	210052	Enguerrand	564	“ but there are symptoms of a mob - epidemic a little further up the fever began at Belleville , and is threatening the health of the Champs Elysees . Do n’t be alarmed — it may be nothing , though it may be much . In Paris , one can never calculate an hour beforehand the exact progress of a politico - epidemic fever . At present I say , ‘ Bah ! a pack of ragged boys , gamins de Paris ; ’ but my friend the Colonel , twisting his moustache en souriant amerement , says , ‘ It is the indignation of Paris at the apathy of the Government under insult to the honour of France ; ’ and Heaven only knows how rapidly French gamins grow into giants when Colonels talk about the indignation of Paris and the honour of France ! ”
210202	210208	210210	210211	Mrs. Morley	462	“ But what has happened ? ”
210218	210221	210223	210224	the warrior	6326	“ Madame , ”
210226	210277	210223	210224	the warrior	6326	“ it is rumoured that the King of Prussia has turned his back upon the ambassador of France ; and that the pekin who is for peace at any price — M. Ollivier — will say tomorrow in the Chamber , that France submits to a slap in the face . ”
210278	210293	210295	210296	Mrs. Morley	462	“ Please , Monsieur de Vandemar , to tell my coachman to drive home , ”
210350	210358	210360	210361	Mrs. Morley	462	“ Is there anything serious in this ? ”
210363	210584	210360	210361	Mrs. Morley	462	“ At this moment , nothing . What it may be this hour to - morrow I can not say . Ah ! Monsieur Vane , bon jour I did not recognise you at first . Once , in a visit at the chateau of one of your distinguished countrymen , I saw two game - cocks turned out facing each other : they needed no pretext for quarrelling — neither do France and Prussia — no matter which game - cock gave the last offence , the two game - cocks must have it out . All that Ollivier can do , if he be wise , is to see that the French cock has his steel spurs as long as the Prussians . But this I do say , that if Ollivier attempts to put the French cock back into its bag , the Empire is gone in forty - eight hours . That to me is a trifle — I care nothing for the Empire ; but that which is not a trifle is anarchy and chaos . Better war and the Empire than peace and Jules Favre . But let us seize the present hour , Mr. Vane ; whatever happens to - morrow , shall we dine together to - day ? Name your restaurant . ”
210585	210591	210593	210593	Graham	378	“ I am so grieved , ”
210598	210612	210596	210596	himself	378	“ I am here only on business , and engaged all the evening . ”
210613	210624	210626	210626	Enguerrand	564	“ What a wonderful thing is this life of ours ! ”
210628	210723	210626	210626	Enguerrand	564	“ The destiny of France at this moment hangs on a thread — I , a Frenchman , say to an English friend , ‘ Let us dine — a cutlet to - day and a fig for to - morrow ; ’ and my English friend , distinguished native of a country with which we have the closest alliance , tells me that in this crisis of France he has business to attend to ! My father is quite right ; he accepts the Voltairean philosophy , and cries , Vivent les indifferents ! ”
210724	210731	210733	210733	Graham	378	“ My dear M. de Vandemar , ”
210735	210804	210733	210733	Graham	378	“ in every country you will find the same thing . All individuals massed together constitute public life . Each individual has a life of his own , the claims and the habits and the needs of which do not suppress his sympathies with public life , but imperiously overrule them . Mrs. Morley , permit me to pull the check - string — I get out here . ”
210805	210811	210813	210813	Enguerrand	564	“ I like that man , ”
210825	210835	210813	210813	Enguerrand	564	“ in language and esprit he is so French . ”
210836	210847	210849	210850	Mrs. Morley	462	“ I use to like him better than you can , ”
210852	210883	210849	210850	Mrs. Morley	462	“ but in prejudice and stupidity he is so English . As it seems you are disengaged , come and partake , pot au feu , with Frank and me . ”
210884	210890	210892	210901	the cleverest and best bred of all Parisian beaux garcons	6334	“ Charmed to do so , ”
210903	210945	210892	210901	the cleverest and best bred of all Parisian beaux garcons	6334	“ but forgive me if I quit you soon . This poor France ! Entre nous , I am very uneasy about the Parisian fever . I must run away after dinner to clubs and cafes to learn the last bulletins . ”
210946	210958	210964	210964	herself	12473	“ We have nothing like that French Legitimist in the States , ”
210966	210986	210964	210964	herself	12473	“ unless we should ever be so silly as to make Legitimists of the ruined gentlemen of the South . ”
211266	211277	211252	211255	the Minister of France	6345	“ Lo ! where I stand , I am war ! ”
211381	211396	211398	211399	the crowd	1967	“ The charming gravity of his countenance — the mysterious expression of his eye ! ”
211420	211430	211432	211432	Savarin	459	“ No chance for my friends the Orleanists now , ”
211434	211460	211432	211432	Savarin	459	“ You who mock at all parties are , I suppose , at heart for the Republican — small chance , too , for that . ”
211461	211475	211360	211360	they	6350	“ I do not agree with you . Violent impulses have quick reactions . ”
211476	211501	211432	211432	Savarin	459	“ But what reaction could shake the Emperor after he returns a conqueror , bringing in his pocket the left bank of the Rhine ? ”
211502	211527	211432	211432	Savarin	459	“ None — when he does that . Will he do it ? Does he himself think he will do it ? I doubt — ”
211528	211537	211360	211360	they	6350	“ Doubt the French army against the Prussian ? ”
211538	211550	211432	211432	Savarin	459	“ Against the German people united — yes , very much . ”
211551	211586	211432	211432	Savarin	459	“ But war will disunite the German people . Bavaria will surely assist us — Hanover will rise against the spoliator — Austria at our first successes must shake off her present enforced neutrality ? ”
211587	211652	211360	211360	they	6350	“ You have not been in Germany , and I have . What yesterday was a Prussian army , to - morrow will be a German population ; far exceeding our own in numbers , in hardihood of body , in cultivated intellect , in military discipline . But talk of something else . How is my ex - editor — poor Gustave Rameau ? ”
211653	211673	211360	211360	they	6350	“ Still very weak , but on the mend . You may have him back in his office soon . ”
211674	211792	211432	211432	Savarin	459	“ Impossible ! even in his sick - bed his vanity was more vigorous than ever . He issued a war - song , which has gone the round of the war journals signed by his own name . He must have known very well that the name of such a Tyrtaeus can not reappear as the editor of Le Sens Commun ; that in launching his little firebrand he burned all vessels that could waft him back to the port he had quitted . But I dare say he has done well for his own interests ; I doubt if Le Sens Commun can much longer hold its ground in the midst of the prevalent lunacy . ”
211793	211811	211360	211360	they	6350	“ What ! it has lost subscribers?—gone off in sale already , since it declared for peace ? ”
211812	211855	211360	211360	they	6350	“ Of course it has ; and after the article which , if I live over to - night , will appear to - morrow , I should wonder if it sell enough to cover the cost of the print and paper . ”
211856	211871	211432	211432	Savarin	459	“ Martyr to principle ! I revere , but I do not envy thee . ”
211872	211914	211360	211360	they	6350	“ Martyrdom is not my ambition . If Louis Napoleon be defeated , what then ? Perhaps he may be the martyr ; and the Favres and Gambettas may roast their own eggs on the gridiron they heat for his majesty . ”
211962	211979	211981	211982	the Englishman	8366	“ May I ask a frank answer to a somewhat rude question , M. le Vicomte ? ”
211984	212031	211981	211982	the Englishman	8366	“ Suppose that the Imperial Government had to - day given in their adhesion to the peace party , how long would it have been before their orators in the Chamber and their organs in the press would have said that France was governed by poltrons ? ”
212032	212062	211981	211982	the Englishman	8366	“ Probably for most of the twenty - four hours . But there are a few who are honest in their convictions ; of that few I am one . ”
212063	212074	211981	211982	the Englishman	8366	“ And would have supported the Emperor and his Government ? ”
212075	212086	211981	211982	the Englishman	8366	“ No , Monsieur — I do not say that . ”
212087	212105	211981	211982	the Englishman	8366	“ Then the Emperor would have turned many friends into enemies , and no enemies into friends . ”
212106	212154	211981	211982	the Englishman	8366	“ Monsieur — you in England know that a party in opposition is not propitiated when the party in power steals its measures . Ha!—pardon me , who is that gentleman , evidently your countryman , whom I see yonder talking to the Secretary of your Embassy ? ”
212155	212192	211981	211982	the Englishman	8366	“ He.—Mr . Vane - Graham Vane . Do you not know him ? He has been much in Paris , attached to our Embassy formerly ; a clever man — much is expected from him . ”
212193	212227	211981	211982	the Englishman	8366	“ Ah ! I think I have seen him before , but am not quite sure . Did you say Vane ? I once knew a Monsieur Vane , a distinguished parliamentary orator . ”
212228	212244	211981	211982	the Englishman	8366	“ That gentleman is his son — would you like to be introduced to him ? ”
212245	212257	211981	211982	the Englishman	8366	“ Not to - day — I am in some hurry . ”
212281	212289	212290	212290	he	578	“ I have seen that man before , ”
212293	212407	212290	212290	he	578	“ where?—when?—can it be only a family likeness to the father ? No , the features are different ; the profile is — ha!—Mr . Lamb , Mr. Lamb — but why call himself by that name?—why disguised?—what can he have to do with poor Louise ? Bah — these are not questions I can think of now . This war — this war — can it yet be prevented ? How it will prostrate all the plans my ambition so carefully schemed ! Oh!—at least if I were but in the Chamber . Perhaps I yet may be before the war is ended — the Clavignys have great interest in their department . ”
212492	212499	212500	212500	he	351	“ Congratulate me , mon cher ! ”
212501	212777	212841	212841	Alain	351	cried—“the news was a joyous surprise to me . Only so recently as yesterday morning I was under the gloomy apprehension that the Imperial Cabinet would continue to back Ollivier ’s craven declaration ‘ that France had not been affronted ! ’ The Duchesse de Tarascon , at whose campagne I was a guest , is ( as you doubtless know ) very much in the confidence of the Tuileries . On the first signs of war , I wrote to her , saying that whatever the objections of my pride to enter the army as a private in time of peace , such objections ceased on the moment when all distinctions of France must vanish in the eyes of sons eager to defend her banners . The Duchesse in reply begged me to come to her campagne and talk over the matter . I went ; she then said that if war should break out it was the intention to organise the Mobiles and officer them with men of birth and education , irrespective of previous military service , and in that case I might count on my epaulets . But only two nights ago she received a letter — I know not of course from whom — evidently from some high authority — that induced her to think the moderation of the Council would avert the war , and leave the swords of the Mobiles in their sheaths . I suspect the decision of yesterday must have been a very sudden one . Ce cher Gramont ! See what it is to have a well - born man in a sovereign ’s councils . ”
212778	212795	212500	212500	he	351	“ If war must come , I at least wish all renown to yourself . But — ”
212796	212840	212841	212841	Alain	351	“ Oh ! spare me your ‘ buts ’ ; the English are always too full of them where her own interests do not appeal to her . She had no ‘ buts ’ for war in India or a march into Abyssinia . ”
212881	212887	212889	212889	he	378	“ I am English enough , ”
212897	212963	212889	212889	he	378	“ to care for English interests ; and England has no interest abroad dearer to her than the welfare and dignity of France . And now let me tell you why I presumed on an acquaintance less intimate than I could desire , to solicit this interview on a matter which concerns myself , and in which you could perhaps render me a considerable service . ”
212964	213009	213010	213010	Graham	378	“ If I can , count it rendered ; move to this sofa — join me in a cigar , and let us talk at ease comme de vieux amis , whose fathers or brothers might have fought side by side in the Crimea . ”
213031	213159	213160	213160	Alain	351	“ Among the correspondence which Monsieur your father has left , are there any letters of no distant date signed Marigny — Madame Marigny ? Pardon me , I should state my motive in putting this question . I am intrusted with a charge , the fulfilment of which may prove to the benefit of this lady or her child ; such fulfilment is a task imposed upon my honour . But all the researches to discover this lady which I have instituted stop at a certain date , with this information,—viz . , that she corresponded occasionally with the late Marquis de Rochebriant ; that he habitually preserved the letters of his correspondents ; and that these letters were severally transmitted to you at his decease . ”
213185	213269	213174	213174	he	378	“ The boxes containing the letters my father received and preserved were sent to me as you say — the larger portion of them were from ladies — sorted and labelled , so that in glancing at any letter in each packet I could judge of the general tenor of these in the same packet without the necessity of reading them . All packets of that kind , Monsieur Vane , I burned . I do not remember any letters signed ‘ Marigny ! ”
213270	213349	212889	212889	he	378	“ I perfectly understand , my dear Marquis , that you would destroy all letters which your father himself would have destroyed if his last illness had been sufficiently prolonged . But I do not think the letters I mean would have come under that classification ; probably they were short , and on matters of business relating to some third person — some person , for instance , of the name of Louise , or of Duval ! ”
213350	213395	212889	212889	he	378	“ Stop ! let me think . I have a vague remembrance of one or two letters which rather perplexed me , they were labelled , ‘ Louise D—. Mem . : to make further inquiries as to the fate of her uncle . ’ ”
213396	213415	213174	213174	he	378	“ Marquis , these are the letters I seek . Thank heaven , you have not destroyed them ? ”
213416	213452	212889	212889	he	378	“ No ; there was no reason why I should destroy , though I really can not state precisely any reason why I kept them . I have a very vague recollection of their existence . ”
213453	213518	212889	212889	he	378	“ I entreat you to allow me at least a glance at the handwriting , and compare it with that of a letter I have about me ; and if the several handwritings correspond , I would ask you to let me have the address , which , according to your father ’s memorandum , will be found in the letters you have preserved . ”
213519	213580	213174	213174	he	378	“ To compliance with such a request I not only can not demur , but perhaps it may free me from some responsibility which I might have thought the letters devolved upon my executorship . I am sure they did not concern the honour of any woman of any family , for in that case I must have burned them . ”
213581	213620	212889	212889	he	378	“ Ah , Marquis , shake hands there ! In such concord between man and man , there is more entente cordiale between England and France than there was at Sebastopol . Now let me compare the handwritings . ”
213621	213677	212889	212889	he	378	“ The box that contained the letters is not here — I left it at Rochebriant ; I will telegraph to my aunt to send it ; the day after to - morrow it will no doubt arrive . Breakfast with me that day — say at one o’clock , and after breakfast the Box ! ”
213678	213685	212889	212889	he	378	“ How can I thank you ? ”
213686	213763	213174	213174	he	378	“ Thank me ! but you said your honour was concerned in your request — requests affecting honour between men comma il faut is a ceremony of course , like a bow between them . One bows , the other returns the bow — no thanks on either side . Now that we have done with that matter , let me say that I thought your wish for our interview originated in a very different cause . ”
213764	213770	212889	212889	he	378	“ What could that be ? ”
213771	213851	212889	212889	he	378	“ Nay , do you not recollect that last talk between us , when with such loyalty you spoke to me about Mademoiselle Cicogna , and supposing that there might be rivalship between us , retracted all that you might have before said to warn me against fostering the sentiment with which she had inspired me ; even at the first slight glance of a face which can not be lightly forgotten by those who have once seen it . ”
213852	213864	213866	213866	Graham	378	“ I recollect perfectly every word of that talk , Marquis , ”
213894	213923	213888	213889	Mrs. Morley	462	“ Was this the man to seize the prize he had put aside — this man , younger than himself — handsomer than himself — higher in rank ? ”
213924	213937	212889	212889	he	378	“ I recollect that talk , Marquis ! Well , what then ? ”
213938	214092	214096	214096	I	0	“ In my self - conceit I supposed that you might have heard how much I admired Mademoiselle Cicogna — how , having not long since met her at the house of Duplessis ( who by the way writes me word that I shall meet you chez lui tomorrow ) , I have since sought her society wherever there was a chance to find it . You may have heard , at our club , or elsewhere , how I adore her genius — how , I say , that nothing so Breton — that is , so pure and so lofty — has appeared and won readers since the days of Chateaubriand,—and — you , knowing that les absents ont toujours tort , come to me and ask Monsieur de Rochebriant , Are we rivals ? I expected a challenge — you relieve my mind — you abandon the field to me ? ”
214154	214166	214146	214146	Graham	378	“ I do not challenge ! Am I to congratulate you ? ”
214167	214334	214335	214335	Graham	378	“ No , that brilliant victory is not for me . I thought that was made clear in the conversation I have referred to . But if you have done me the honour to be jealous I am exceedingly flattered . Speaking , seriously , if I admired Mademoiselle Cicogna when you and I last met , the admiration is increased by the respect with which I regard a character so simply noble . How many women older than she would have been spoiled by the adulation that has followed her literary success!—how few women so young , placed in a position so critical , having the courage to lead a life so independent , would have maintained the dignity of their character free from a single indiscretion ! I speak not from my own knowledge , but from the report of all , who would be pleased enough to censure if they could find a cause . Good society is the paradise of mauvaises langues . ”
214354	214523	214349	214351	The young Marquis	351	“ You will pardon me for speaking thus freely in the way that I would wish any friend to speak of the demoiselle who might become my wife . I owe you much , not only for the loyalty with which you address me in reference to this young lady , but for words affecting my own position in France , which sank deep into my mind — saved me from deeming myself a proscrit in my own land — filled me with a manly ambition , not stifled amidst the thick of many effeminate follies — and , in fact , led me to the career which is about to open before me , and in which my ancestors have left me no undistinguished examples . Let us speak , then , a coeur ouvert , as one friend to another . Has there been any misunderstanding between you and Mademoiselle Cicogna which has delayed your return to Paris ? If so , is it over now ? ”
214524	214532	214349	214351	The young Marquis	351	“ There has been no such misunderstanding . ”
214533	214555	214349	214351	The young Marquis	351	“ Do you doubt whether the sentiments you expressed in regard to her when we met last year , are returned ? ”
214556	214570	214349	214351	The young Marquis	351	“ I have no right to conjecture her sentiments . You mistake altogether . ”
214571	214672	214349	214351	The young Marquis	351	“ I do not believe that I am dunce enough to mistake your feelings towards Mademoiselle — they may be read in your face at this moment . Of course I do not presume to hazard a conjecture as to those of Mademoiselle towards yourself . But when I met her not long since at the house of Duplessis , with whose daughter she is intimate , I chanced to speak to her of you ; and if I may judge , by looks and manner , I chose no displeasing theme . You turn away — I offend you ? ”
214673	214734	214785	214785	Duplessis	361	“ Offend!—no , indeed ; but on this subject I am not prepared to converse . I came to Paris on matters of business much complicated and which ought to absorb my attention . I can not longer trespass on your evening . The day after to - morrow , then , I will be with you at one o’clock . ”
214735	214764	214765	214765	Graham	378	“ Yes , I hope then to have the letters you wish to consult ; and , meanwhile , we meet to - morrow at the Hotel Duplessis . ”
214945	214948	214950	214951	the financier	2098	“ Valerie , ”
214955	215003	214950	214951	the financier	2098	“ though so young , has a very clear head for business , and she is so interested in all that interests myself , that even where I do not take her opinion , I at least feel my own made livelier and brighter by her sympathy . ”
215230	215261	215214	215214	Duplessis	361	“ Marquis , what is this I have just heard from the Duchesse de Tarascon ? Can it be ? You ask military service in this ill - omened war?—you ? ”
215262	215269	215271	215271	Alain	351	“ My dear and best friend , ”
215277	215390	215271	215271	Alain	351	“ I should have thought that you , of all men in the world , would have most approved of my request — you , so devoted an Imperialist — you , indignant that the representative of one of these families , which the First Napoleon so eagerly and so vainly courted , should ask for the grade of sous - lieutenant in the armies of Napoleon the Third — you , who of all men know how ruined are the fortunes of a Rochebriant — you , feel surprised that he clings to the noblest heritage his ancestors have left to him — their sword ! I do not understand you . ”
215391	215394	215396	215396	Duplessis	361	“ Marquis , ”
215458	215610	216023	216023	Alain	351	“ Marquis , pardon me ; you talk finely , but you do not talk common sense . I should be extremely pleased if your Legitimist scruples had allowed you to solicit , or rather to accept , a civil appointment not unsuited to your rank , under the ablest sovereign , as a civilian , to whom France can look for rational liberty combined with established order . Such openings to a suitable career you have rejected ; but who on earth could expect you , never trained to military service , to draw a sword hitherto sacred to the Bourbons , on behalf of a cause which the madness , I do not say of France but of Paris , has enforced on a sovereign against whom you would fight to - morrow if you had a chance of placing the descendant of Henry IV . on his throne . ”
215611	215630	216023	216023	Alain	351	“ I am not about to fight for any sovereign , but for my country against the foreigner . ”
215631	215783	216149	216149	Duplessis	361	“ An excellent answer if the foreigner had invaded your country ; but it seems that your country is going to invade the foreigner — a very different thing . Chut ! all this discussion is most painful to me . I feel for the Emperor a personal loyalty , and for the hazards he is about to encounter a prophetic dread , as an ancestor of yours might have felt for Francis I. could he have foreseen Pavia . Let us talk of ourselves and the effect the war should have upon our individual action . You are aware , of course , that , though M. Louvier has had notice of our intention to pay off his mortgage , that intention can not be carried into effect for six months ; if the money be not then forthcoming his hold on Rochebriant remains unshaken — the sum is large . ”
215784	215789	216023	216023	Alain	351	“ Alas ! yes . ”
215790	215926	216023	216023	Alain	351	“ The war must greatly disturb the money - market , affect many speculative adventures and operations when at the very moment credit may be most needed . It is absolutely necessary that I should be daily at my post on the Bourse , and hourly watch the ebb and flow of events . Under these circumstances I had counted , permit me to count still , on your presence in Bretagne . We have already begun negotiations on a somewhat extensive scale , whether as regards the improvement of forests and orchards , or the plans for building allotments , as soon as the lands are free for disposal — for all these the eye of a master is required . I entreat you , then , to take up your residence at Rochebriant . ”
215927	215989	216023	216023	Alain	351	“ My dear friend , this is but a kindly and delicate mode of relieving me from the dangers of war . I have , as you must be conscious , no practical knowledge of business . Hebert can be implicitly trusted , and will carry out your views with a zeal equal to mine , and with infinitely more ability . ”
215990	216022	216023	216023	Alain	351	“ Marquis , pray neither to Hercules nor to Hebert ; if you wish to get your own cart out of the ruts , put your own shoulder to the wheel . ”
216044	216148	216035	216035	he	351	“ I shall ever remain grateful for what you have done , and wish to do for me . But , assuming that you suppose rightly , the estates of Rochebriant would , in your hands , become a profitable investment , and more than redeem the mortgage , and the sum you have paid Louvier on my account , let it pass to you irrespectively of me . I shall console myself in the knowledge that the old place will be restored , and those who honoured its old owners prosper in hands so strong , guided by a heart so generous . ”
216335	216361	216324	216324	Duplessis	361	“ Listen to me , I love you — I never had a son — be mine — Rochebriant shall be my daughter ’s dot . ”
216373	216456	216362	216362	Alain	351	“ Father , your first desire must be honour for your son . You have guessed my secret — I have learned to love Valerie . Seeing her out in the world , she seemed like other girls , fair and commonplace — seeing her — at your house , I have said to myself , ‘ There is the one girl fairer than all others in my eyes , and the one individual to whom all other girls are commonplace . ’ ”
216457	216463	216327	216327	his	361	“ Is that true?—is it ? ”
216464	216798	216832	216832	he	6393	“ True ! does a gentilhomme ever lie ? And out of that love for her has grown this immovable desire to be something worthy of her — something that may lift me from the vulgar platform of men who owe all to ancestors , nothing to themselves . Do you suppose for one moment that I , saved from ruin and penury by Valerie ’s father , could be base enough to say to her , ‘ In return be Madame la Marquise de Rochebriant ’ ? Do you suppose that I , whom you would love and respect as son , could come to you and say : ‘ I am oppressed by your favours — I am crippled with debts — give me your millions and we are quits . ’ No , Duplessis ! You , so well descended yourself — so superior as man amongst men that you would have won name and position had you been born the son of a shoeblack,—you would eternally despise the noble who , in days when all that we Bretons deem holy in noblesse are subjected to ridicule and contempt , should so vilely forget the only motto which the scutcheons of all gentilhommes have in common , ‘ Noblesse oblige . ’ War , with all its perils and all its grandeur,—war lifts on high the banners of France,—war , in which every ancestor of mine whom I care to recall aggrandised the name that descends to me . Let me then do as those before me have done ; let me prove that I am worth something in myself , and then you and I are equals ; and I can say with no humbled crest , ‘ Your benefits are accepted : ’ the man who has fought not ignobly for France may aspire to the hand of her daughter . Give me Valerie ; as to her dot,—be it so , Rochebriant,—it will pass to her children . ”
216799	216813	216362	216362	Alain	351	“ Alain ! Alain ! my friend ! my son!—but if you fall . ”
216814	216823	216824	216824	Duplessis	752	“ Valerie will give you a nobler son . ”
216884	216895	216881	216881	he	1106	“ My country is insulted and her banner is unfurled , ”
216999	217030	216953	216960	the man who , excepting only De Mauleon	6400	“ How right you have been , Duplessis , when you have laughed at those who have said , ‘ The Emperor is ill , decrepit , done up . ’ ”
217031	217048	217050	217050	he	6393	“ Vive l’Empereur ! at least we shall be face to face with those insolent Prussians ! ”
217095	217149	217086	217086	he	6393	“ Sleep well to - night , child ; Alain has told me that he adores thee , and if he will go to the war , it is that he may lay his laurels at thy feet . Bless thee , my child , thou couldst not have made a nobler choice . ”

218303	218307	218309	218309	Duplessis	752	“ Mr. Vane , ”
218311	218320	218309	218309	Duplessis	752	“ will you take into dinner Mademoiselle Cicogna ? ”
218330	218336	218309	218309	Duplessis	752	“ never did run smooth , ”
219313	219333	219309	219309	he	378	“ Why is that girl so changed to me ? Merciful heaven ! is she lost to my life ? ”
219480	219537	219464	219467	the Duchesse de Tarascon	366	“ Of course you and I must go with the stream . But is not all the fine talk that has passed to - day at your table , and in which we too have joined , a sort of hypocrisy ? I may say this to you ; I would say it to no other . ”
219538	219683	219684	219685	The Duchesse	2775	“ And I say to you , Madame la Duchesse , that which I would say to no other . Thinking over it as I sit alone , I find myself making a ‘ terrible hazard ; ’ but when I go abroad and become infected by the general enthusiasm , I pluck up gaiety of spirit , and whisper to myself , ‘ True , but it may be an enormous gain . ’ To get the left bank of the Rhine is a trifle ; but to check in our next neighbour a growth which a few years hence would overtop us,—that is no trifle . And , be the gain worth the hazard or not , could the Emperor , could any Government likely to hold its own for a week , have declined to take the chance of the die ? ”
219712	219932	219707	219707	she	2775	“ No Government that held its tenure on popular suffrage could have done so . But if the Emperor had retained the personal authority which once allowed the intellect of one man to control and direct the passions of many , I think the war would have been averted . I have reason to know that the Emperor gave his emphatic support to the least bellicose members of the Council , and that Gramont ’s speech did not contain the passage that precipitates hostilities when the Council in which it was framed broke up . These fatal Ministers found the Chamber , and the reports of the popular excitement which could not be resisted without imminent danger of revolution . It is Paris that has forced the war on the Emperor . But enough of this subject . What must be , must , and , as you say , the gain may be greater than the hazard . I come to something else you whispered to me before we went in to dinner,—a sort of complaint which wounds me sensibly . You say I had assisted to a choice of danger and possibly of death a very distant connection of mine , who might have been a very near connection of yours . You mean Alain de Rochebriant ? ”
219933	219950	219707	219707	she	2775	“ Yes ; I accept him as a suitor for the hand of my only daughter . ”
219951	220063	219707	219707	she	2775	“ I am so glad , not for your sake so much as for his . No one can know him well without appreciating in him the finest qualities of the finest order of the French noble ; but having known your pretty Valerie so long , my congratulations are for the man who can win her . Meanwhile , hear my explanation : when I promised Alain any interest I can command for the grade of officer in a regiment of Mobiles , I knew not that he had formed , or was likely to form , ties or duties to keep him at home . I withdraw my promise . ”
220064	220140	219707	219707	she	2775	“ No , Duchesse , fulfil it . I should be disloyal indeed if I robbed a sovereign under whose tranquil and prosperous reign I have acquired , with no dishonour , the fortune which Order proffers to Commerce , of one gallant defender in the hour of need . And , speaking frankly , if Alain were really my son , I think I am Frenchman enough to remember that France is my mother . ”
220141	220153	220155	220156	the Duchesse	2775	“ Say no more , my friend — say no more , ”
220176	220297	220155	220156	the Duchesse	2775	“ If every Frenchman felt as you do ; if in this Paris of ours all hostilities of class may merge in the one thought of the common country ; if in French hearts there yet thrills the same sentiment as that which , in the terrible days when all other ties were rent asunder , revered France as mother , and rallied her sons to her aid against the confederacy of Europe,—why , then , we need not grow pale with dismay at the sight of a Prussian needle - gun . Hist ! look yonder : is not that a tableau of Youth in Arcady ? Worlds rage around , and Love , unconcerned , whispers to Love ! ”
220485	220573	220581	220581	they	6508	“ Do you remember that evening at Enghien ? how I said that our imagination could not carry us beyond the question whether we two should be gazing together that night twelve months on that star which each of us had singled out from the hosts of heaven ? That was the 8th of July . It is the 8th of July once more . Come and seek for our chosen star — come . I have something to say , which say I must . Come . ”
220649	220652	220654	220655	the Englishman	8366	“ Isaura , ”
220682	220825	220654	220655	the Englishman	8366	“ Isaura , I have tried to live without you . I can not . You are all in all to me : without you it seems to me as if earth had no flowers , and even heaven had withdrawn its stars . Are there differences between us , differences of taste , of sentiments , of habits , of thought ? Only let me hope that you can love me a tenth part so much as I love you , and such differences cease to be discord . Love harmonises all sounds , blends all colours into its own divine oneness of heart and soul . Look up ! is not the star which this time last year invited our gaze above , is it not still there ? Does it not still invite our gaze ? Isaura , speak ! ”
220826	220831	220862	220862	he	6517	“ Hush , hush , hush,”—the
220886	220945	220862	220862	he	6517	“ Isaura , there is one name which I can never utter without a reverence due to the religion which binds earth to heaven — a name which to man should be the symbol of life cheered and beautified , exalted , hallowed . That name is ‘ wife . ’ Will you take that name from me ? ”
220995	221000	221001	221001	she	454	“ Mockery , mockery , ”
221019	221047	221001	221001	she	454	“ Did you wait to ask me that question till you knew what my answer must be ? I have pledged the name of wife to another . ”
221048	221069	221070	221070	Isaura	454	“ No , no ; you say that to rebuke , to punish me ! Unsay it ! unsay it ! ”
221081	221089	221090	221090	she	454	“ How can my words pain you ? ”
221095	221111	221090	221090	she	454	“ Did you not write that I had unfitted myself to be wife to you ? ”
221112	221115	221001	221001	she	454	“ I ? ”
221116	221153	221001	221001	she	454	“ That I had left behind me the peaceful immunities of private life ? I felt you were so right ! Yes ! I am affianced to one who thinks that in spite of that misfortune — ”
221154	221197	221090	221090	she	454	“ Stop , I command you — stop ! You saw my letter to Mrs. Morley . I have not had one moment free from torture and remorse since I wrote it . But whatever in that letter you might justly resent — ”
221198	221204	221205	221205	Graham	378	“ I did not resent — ”
221215	221426	221090	221090	she	454	“ You would forgive could you read my heart . No matter . Every sentiment in that letter , except those which conveyed admiration , I retract . Be mine , and instead of presuming to check in you the irresistible impulse of genius to the first place in the head or the heart of the world , I teach myself to encourage , to share , to exult in it . Do you know what a difference there is between the absent one and the present one — between the distant image against whom our doubts , our fears , our suspicions , raise up hosts of imaginary giants , barriers of visionary walls , and the beloved face before the sight of which the hosts are fled , the walls are vanished ? Isaura , we meet again . You know now from my own lips that I love you . I think your lips will not deny that you love me . You say that you are affianced to another . Tell the man frankly , honestly , that you mistook your heart . It is not yours to give . Save yourself , save him , from a union in which there can be no happiness . ”
221427	221433	221435	221435	Isaura	454	“ It is too late , ”
221454	221533	221435	221435	Isaura	454	“ Did I say now to that other one , ‘ I break the faith that I pledged to you , ’ I should kill him , body and soul . Slight thing though I be , to him I am all in all ; to you , Mr. Vane , to you a memory — the memory of one whom a year , perhaps a month , hence , you will rejoice to think you have escaped . ”
221625	221633	221635	221636	the Marquis	8274	“ I am glad to tell you , ”
221640	221660	221635	221636	the Marquis	8274	“ that the box has arrived , and we will very soon examine its contents . Breakfast claims precedence . ”

221818	221853	222128	222128	your	6531	“ Did she ? It seemed to me that , in health at least , she did not look very well . Have you heard what day M. Thiers will speak on the war ? ”
221854	221914	222128	222128	your	6531	“ Thiers ? No . Who cares about Thiers ? Thank heaven his day is past ! I do n’t know any unmarried woman in Paris , not even Valerie — I mean Mademoiselle Duplessis — who has so exquisite a taste in dress as Mademoiselle Cicogna . Generally speaking , the taste of a female author is atrocious . ”
221915	221946	222128	222128	your	6531	“ Really — I did not observe her dress . I am no critic on subjects so dainty as the dress of ladies , or the tastes of female authors . ”

221959	222019	221953	221955	the beau Marquis	5159	“ As to dress , I think that so essential a thing in the mind of woman , that no man who cares about women ought to disdain critical study of it . In woman , refinement of character is never found in vulgarity of dress . I have only observed that truth since I came up from Bretagne . ”
222020	222124	222128	222128	your	6531	“ I presume , my dear Marquis , that you may have read in Bretagne books which very few not being professed scholars have ever read at Paris ; and possibly you may remember that Horace ascribes the most exquisite refinement in dress , denoted by the untranslatable words , ‘ simplex munditiis , ’ to a lady who was not less distinguished by the ease and rapidity with which she could change her affection . Of course that allusion does not apply to Mademoiselle Cicogna , but there are many other exquisitely dressed ladies at Paris of whom an ill - fated admirer “
222140	222210	222211	222211	Rudesheim	524	” The box being produced and unlocked , Alain looked with conscientious care at its contents before he passed over to Graham ’s inspection a few epistles , in which the Englishman immediately detected the same handwriting as that of the letter from Louise which Richard King had bequeathed to him . They were arranged and numbered chronologically . ( Seven months after the date of Letter 1 . ) “
222213	222266	222211	222211	Rudesheim	524	” Could this be the relation , possibly the wife , of the Count von Rudesheim with whom Graham had formed acquaintance last year ? LETTER III .

222472	222508	222509	222509	I	0	” There was no address on this note - no postmark on the envelope - evidently sent by hand . The last note , dated 1861 , March 20 , was briefer than its predecessor . “
222586	222599	222601	222601	Graham	932	“ There are no other letters , then , from this writer ? ”
222603	222613	222601	222601	Graham	932	“ and no further clue as to her existence ? ”
222614	222739	222557	222557	you	0	“ None that I have discovered ; and I see now why I preserved these letters . There is nothing in their contents not creditable to my poor father . They show how capable he was of good - natured disinterested kindness towards even a distant relation of whom he could certainly not have been proud , judging not only by his own pencilled note , or by the writer ’s condition as a governess , but by her loose sentiments as to the marriage tie . I have not the slightest idea who she could be . I never at least heard of one connected , however distantly , with my family , whom I could identify with the writer of these letters . ”

222753	222836	222601	222601	Graham	932	“ Pardon me a preliminary question . If I may venture to form a conjecture , the object of your search must be connected with your countryman , whom the lady politely calls the ‘ wretched Englishman ; ’ but I own I should not like to lend , through these letters , a pretence to any steps that may lead to a scandal in which my father ’s name or that of any member of my family could be mixed up . ”

Perhaps of the two I have more need of reservation and wary guard against any stranger than you have . Allow me to propose the alternative — perfect openness . What say you ? ”

225042	225065	224983	224990	the man from whom he had anticipated quarrel	6596	“ Whom I consulted as to the means of ascertaining whether Louise Duval was alive,—if so , where she could be found . ”
225066	225258	224970	224971	an Englishman	1514	“ I thank you very much for your information . I had no notion that the police of Paris had divined the original alias of poor Monsieur Lebeau , though something occurred at Lyons which made me suspect it . Strange that the Government , knowing through the police that Victor de Mauleon , a writer they had no reason to favour , had been in so humble a position , should never , even in their official journals , have thought it prudent to say so ! But , now I think of it , what if they had ? They could prove nothing against Jean Lebeau . They could but say , ‘ Jean Lebeau is suspected to be too warm a lover of liberty , too earnest a friend of the people , and Jean Lebeau is the editor of La Sens Commun . ’ Why , that assertion would have made Victor de Mauleon the hero of the Reds , the last thing a prudent Government could desire . I thank you cordially for your frank reply . Now , what question would you put to me ? ”
225259	225273	224970	224971	an Englishman	1514	“ In one word , all you can tell me about Louise Duval . ”
225274	226406	224970	224971	an Englishman	1514	“ You shall have it . I had heard vaguely in my young days that a half - sister of mine by my father ’s first marriage with Mademoiselle de Beauvilliers had — when in advanced middle life he married a second time — conceived a dislike for her mother - in - law , and , being of age , with an independent fortune of her own , had quitted the house , taken up her residence with an elderly female relative , and there had contracted a marriage with a man who gave her lessons in drawing . After that marriage , which my father in vain tried to prevent , my sister was renounced by her family . That was all I knew till , after I came into my inheritance by the death of both my parents , I learned from my father ’s confidential lawyer that the drawing - master , M. Duval , had soon dissipated his wife ’s fortune , become a widower with one child — a girl — and fallen into great distress . He came to my father , begging for pecuniary aid . My father , though by no means rich , consented to allow him a yearly pension , on condition that he never revealed to his child her connection with our family . The man agreed to the condition , and called at my father ’s lawyer quarterly for his annuity . But the lawyer informed me that this deduction from my income had ceased , that M. Duval had not for a year called or sent for the sum due to him , and that he must therefore be dead . One day my valet informed me that a young lady wished to see me — in those days young ladies very often called on me . I desired her to be shown in . There entered a young creature , almost of my own age , who , to my amazement saluted me as uncle . This was the child of my half - sister . Her father had been dead several months , fulfilling very faithfully the condition on which he had held his pension , and the girl never dreaming of the claims that , if wise , poor child , she ought not to have cared for , viz . ,—to that obsolete useless pauper birthright , a branch on the family tree of a French noble . But in pinch of circumstance , and from female curiosity , hunting among the papers her father had left for some clue to the reasons for the pension he had received , she found letters from her mother , letters from my father , which indisputably proved that she was grandchild to the fue Vicomte de Mauleon , and niece to myself . Her story as told to me was very pitiable . Conceiving herself to be nothing higher in birth than daughter to this drawing - master , at his death , poor , penniless orphan that she was , she had accepted the hand of an English student of medicine whom she did not care for . Miserable with this man , on finding by the documents I refer to that she was my niece , she came to me for comfort and counsel . What counsel could I or any man give to her but to make the best of what had happened , and live with her husband ? But then she started another question . It seems that she had been talking with some one , I think her landlady , or some other woman with whom she had made acquaintance — was she legally married to this man ? Had he not entrapped her ignorance into a false marriage ? This became a grave question , and I sent at once to my lawyer . On hearing the circumstances , he at once declared that the marriage was not legal according to the laws of France . But , doubtless , her English soi - disant husband was not cognisant of the French law , and a legal marriage could , with his assent , be at once solemnised . Monsieur Vane , I can not find words to convey to you the joy that poor girl showed in her face and in her words when she learned that she was not bound to pass her life with that man as his wife . It was in vain to talk and reason with her . Then arose the other question , scarcely less important . True , the marriage was not legal , but would it not be better on all accounts to take steps to have it formally annulled , thus freeing her from the harassment of any claim the Englishman might advance , and enabling her to establish the facts in a right position , not injurious to her honour in the eyes of any future suitor to her hand ? She would not hear of such a proposal . She declared that she could not bring to the family she pined to re - enter the scandal of disgrace . To allow that she had made such a misalliance would be bad enough in itself ; but to proclaim to the world that , though nominally the wife , she had in fact been only the mistress of this medical student — she would rather throw herself into the Seine . All she desired was to fund some refuge , some hiding - place for a time , whence she could write to the man informing him that he had no lawful hold on her . Doubtless he would not seek then to molest her . He would return to his own country , and be effaced from her life . And then , her story unknown , she might form a more suitable alliance . Fiery young creature though she was — true De Mauleon in being so fiery — she interested me strongly . I should say that she was wonderfully handsome ; and though imperfectly educated , and brought up in circumstances so lowly , there was nothing common about her — a certain je ne sais quoi of stateliness and race . At all events she did with me what she wished . I agreed to aid her desire of a refuge and hiding - place . Of course I could not lodge her in my own apartment , but I induced a female relation of her mother ’s , an old lady living at Versailles , to receive her , stating her birth , but of course concealing her illegal marriage . “
226757	226758	226755	226755	Louvier	399	” “
226764	226765	226759	226759	Louvier	399	” “
227164	227299	227300	227300	Louvier	399	“ This last consideration so pressed on me that , when Louvier called on me , I think that day or the nests I gave him Louise ’s note , and told him that , if he were still as much in love with her as ever , les absents ont toujours tort , and he had better go to Aix - la - Chapelle and find her out ; that he had my hearty approval of his wooing , and consent to his marriage , though I still urged the wisdom and fairness , if she would take the preliminary step — which , after all , the French law frees as much as possible from pain and scandal — of annulling the irregular marriage into which her childlike youth had been decoyed . “
227406	227436	227437	227437	Louise	385	” The man paused here , evidently with painful emotion . He resumed in the quiet matter - of - fact way in which he had commenced his narrative . “
227525	227756	227513	227513	I	0	“ I may now say more . It appears that when he arrived at Aix - la - Chapelle he found that Louise Duval had left it a day or two previously , and according to scandal had been for some time courted by a wealthy and noble lover , whom she had gone to Munich to meet . Louvier believed this tale : quitted Aix indignantly , and never heard more of her . The probability is , M. Vane , that she must have been long dead . But if living still , I feel quite sure that she will communicate with me some day or other . Now that I have reappeared in Paris in my own name — entered into a career that , for good or for evil , must ere long bring my name very noisily before the public — Louise can not fail to hear of my existence and my whereabouts ; and unless I am utterly mistaken as to her character , she will assuredly inform me of her own . Oblige me with your address , and in that case I will let you know . Of course I take for granted the assurance you gave me last year , that you only desire to discover her in order to render her some benefit , not to injure or molest her ? ”
227757	227880	227500	227500	I	0	“ Certainly . To that assurance I pledge my honour . Any letter with which you may favour me had better be directed to my London address ; here is my card . But , M. le Vicomte , there is one point on which pray pardon me if I question you still . Had you no suspicion that there was one reason why this lady might have quitted Paris so hastily , and have so shrunk from the thought of a marriage so advantageous , in a worldly point of view , as that with M. Louvier,—namely , that she anticipated the probability of becoming the mother of a child by the man whom she refused to acknowledge as a husband ? ”
227881	228021	227513	227513	I	0	“ That idea did not strike me until you asked me if she had a child . Should your conjecture be correct , it would obviously increase her repugnance to apply for the annulment of her illegal marriage . But if Louise is still living and comes across me , I do not doubt that , the motives for concealment no longer operating , she will confide to me the truth . Since we have been talking together thus frankly , I suppose I may fairly ask whether I do not guess correctly in supposing that this soi - disant husband , whose name I forget,—Mac — something , perhaps , Scotch - I think she said he was Ecossais,—is dead and has left by will some legacy to Louise and any child she may have borne to him ? ”
228022	228137	227513	227513	I	0	“ Not exactly so . The man , as you say , is dead ; but he bequeathed no legacy to the lady who did not hold herself married to him . But there are those connected with him who , knowing the history , think that some compensation is due for the wrong so unconsciously done to her , and yet more to any issue of a marriage not meant to be irregular or illegal . Permit me now to explain why I sought you in another guise and name than my own . I could scarcely place in M. Lebeau the confidence which I now unreservedly place in the Vicomte de Mauleon . ”
228138	228162	227500	227500	I	0	“ Cela va sans dire . You believed , then , that calumny about the jewels ; you do not believe it now ? ”
228163	228181	227513	227513	I	0	“ Now ! my amazement is , that any one who had known you could believe it . ”
228182	228417	227513	227513	I	0	“ Oh , how often , and with tears of rage in my exile — my wanderings — have I asked that question of myself ! That rage has ceased ; and I have but one feeling left for that credulous , fickle Paris , of which one day I was the idol , the next the byword . Well , a man sometimes plays chess more skilfully for having been long a mere bystander . He understands better how to move , and when to sacrifice the pieces . Politics , M. Vane , is the only exciting game left to me at my years . At yours , there is still that of love . How time flies ! we are nearing the station at which I descend . I have kinsfolk of my mother ’s in these districts . They are not Imperialists ; they are said to be powerful in the department . But before I apply to them in my own name , I think it prudent that M. Lebeau should quietly ascertain what is their real strength , and what would be the prospects of success if Victor de Mauleon offered himself as depute at the next election . Wish him joy , M. Vane ! If he succeed , you will hear of him some day crowned in the Capitol , or hurled from the Tarpeian rock . ”
228456	228475	228448	228448	he	634	“ Be sure I will not forget your address if I have anything to say . Bon voyage ! ”

229765	229772	229773	229773	he	6691	“ There must be another revolution , ”

229846	229883	229816	229816	He	634	“ Messieurs , or Citoyens , which ye will — I no longer call ye confreres — you have disobeyed or blundered my instructions . On such an occasion disobedience and blunder are crimes equally heinous . ”
229887	230062	230078	230079	the Pole	3923	“ Silence ! Do not add mutiny to your other offences . My instructions were simple and short . Aid in the abolition of the Empire . Do not aid in any senseless cry for a Republic or any other form of government . Leave that to the Legislature . What have you done ? You swelled the crowd that invaded the Corps Ligislatif . You , Dombinsky , not even a Frenchman , dare to mount the President ’s rostrum , and brawl forth your senseless jargon . You , Edgar Ferrier , from whom I expected better , ascend the tribune , and invite the ruffians in the crowd to march to the prisons and release the convicts ; and all of you swell the mob at the Hotel de Ville , and inaugurate the reign of folly by creating an oligarchy of lawyers to resist the march of triumphal armies . Messieurs , I have done with you . You are summoned for the last time : the Council is dissolved . ”

230395	230404	230388	230388	Lebeau	634	“ choose between the door and the window . ”

230457	230460	230462	230462	Lebeau	634	“ Messieurs , ”
230466	230597	230598	230598	He	6710	“ I repeat that the Council is dissolved . In fact its object is fulfilled more abruptly than any of us foresaw , and by means which I at least had been too long out of Paris to divine as possible . I now see that every aberration of reason is possible to the Parisians . The object that united us was the fall of the Empire . As I have always frankly told you , with that object achieved , separation commences . Each of us has his own crotchet , which differs from the other man ’s . Pursue yours as you will — I pursue mine — you will find Jean Lebeau no more in Paris : il s’eface . Au plaisir , mais pas au revoir . ”
230727	230732	230734	230734	he	698	“ Pardon , citizen , ”
230736	230753	230734	230734	he	698	“ but do I understand that you have sent the Council of Ten to the devil ? ”
230754	230802	230734	230734	he	698	“ I ? Certainly not , my good Paul ; I dismiss them to go where they like . If they prefer the direction you name , it is their own choice . I declined to accompany them , and I advise you not to do so . ”
230803	230848	230734	230734	he	698	“ But , citizen , have you considered what is to become of Madame ? Is she to be turned out of the lodge ? Are my wages to stop , and Madame to be left without a crust to put into her soup ? ”
230849	230904	230734	230734	he	698	“ Not so bad as that ; I have just paid the rent of the baraque for three months in advance , and there is your quarter ’s pay , in advance also . My kind regards to Madame , and tell her to keep your skin safe from the schemes of these lunatics . ”
231114	231243	231105	231108	the Medicin des Pauvres	6731	“ You are a brave fellow , Monnier . Lebeau owes you a good turn . But for your cry , ‘ We are not assassins , ’ the Pole might not have been left without support . No atmosphere is so infectious as that in which we breathe the same air of revenge : when the violence of one man puts into action the anger or suspicion of others , they become like a pack of hounds , which follow the spring of the first hound , whether on the wild boar or their own master . Even I , who am by no means hot - headed , had my hand on my case - knife when the word ‘ assassin ’ rebuked and disarmed me . ”
231244	231247	231249	231249	Monnier	650	“ Nevertheless , ”
231253	231284	231249	231249	Monnier	650	“ I half repent the impulse which made me interfere to save that man . Better he should die than live to betray the cause we allowed him to lead . ”
231285	231348	231105	231108	the Medicin des Pauvres	6731	“ Nay , mon ami , speaking candidly , we must confess that he never from the first pretended to advocate the cause for which you conspired . On the contrary , he always said that with the fall of the Empire our union would cease , and each become free to choose his own way towards his own after - objects . ”
231349	231352	231354	231354	Armand	650	“ Yes , ”
231358	231384	231354	231354	Armand	650	“ he said that to me privately , with still greater plainness than he said it to the Council . But I answered as plainly . ”
231385	231388	231105	231108	the Medicin des Pauvres	6731	“ How ? ”
231389	231671	231105	231108	the Medicin des Pauvres	6731	“ I told him that the man who takes the first step in a revolution , and persuades others to go along with him , can not in safety stand still or retreat when the next step is to be taken . It is ‘ en avant ’ or ‘ a la lanterne . ’ So it shall be with him . Shall a fellow - being avail himself of the power over my mind which he derives from superior education or experience,—break into wild fragments my life , heretofore tranquil , orderly , happy,—make use of my opinions , which were then but harmless desires , to serve his own purpose , which was hostile to the opinions he roused into action,—say to me , ‘ Give yourself up to destroy the first obstacle in the way of securing a form of society which your inclinations prefer , ’ and then , that first obstacle destroyed , cry , ‘ Halt ! I go with you no further ; I will not help you to piece together the life I have induced you to shatter ; I will not aid you to substitute for the society that pained you the society that would please ; I leave you , struggling , bewildered , maddened , in the midst of chaos within and without you ’ ? Shall a fellow - being do this , and vanish with a mocking cry : ‘ Tool ! I have had enough of thee ; I cast thee aside as worthless lumber ’ ? Ah ! let him beware ! The tool is of iron , and can be shaped to edge and point . ”
231710	231716	231717	231717	he	715	“ Pooh , my friend ! ”
231723	231884	231717	231717	he	715	“ you are too excited now to think justly . Go home and kiss your children . Never do anything that may make them shrink from their father . And as to Lebeau , try and forget him . He says he shall disappear from Paris . I believe him . It is clear to me that the man is not what he seemed to us . No man of sixty could by so easy a sleight of hand have brought that giant Pole to his knee . If Lebeau reappear it will be in some other form . Did you notice that in the momentary struggle his flaxen wig got disturbed , and beneath it I saw a dark curl . I suspect that the man is not only younger than he seemed , but of higher rank — a conspirator against one throne , perhaps , in order to be minister under another . There are such men . ”

McMahon was wounded conveniently , and has his own terms for it . The regular army is nowhere . Thou wilt see — thou wilt see — they will not stop the march of the Prussians .

Though of intellect which , had it been disciplined , was far superior to his brother ’s , it was so estranged from practical opinions , so warped , so heated , so flawed and cracked in parts , that he did not see the ridicule of Charles ’s braggadocio . Charles had succeeded in life , Armand had failed ; and Armand believed in the worldly wisdom of the elder born . But he was far too sincere for any bribe to tempt him to forsake his creed and betray his opinions . And he knew that it must be a very different revolution from that which his brother contemplated , that could allow him to marry another man ’s wife , and his “
233158	233166	232992	232993	a decorator	6781	” to confiscate other people ’s property . “

233374	234165	234166	234166	My	0	” Here the brothers were joined by some loungers belonging to the National Guard . The talk became general , the potations large . Towards daybreak Armand reeled home , drunk for the first time in his life . He was one of those whom drink makes violent . Marie had been sitting up for him , alarmed at his lengthened absence . But when she would have thrown herself on his breast , her pale face and her passionate sobs enraged him . He flung her aside roughly . From that night the man ’s nature was changed . If , as a physiognomist has said , each man has in him a portion of the wild beast , which is suppressed by mild civilising circumstances , and comes uppermost when self - control is lost , the nature of many an honest workman , humane and tender - hearted as the best of us , commenced a change into the wild beast that raged through the civil war of the Communists , on the day when half - a - dozen Incapables , with no more claim to represent the people of Paris than half - a - dozen monkeys would have , were allowed to elect themselves to supreme power , and in the very fact of that election released all the elements of passion , and destroyed all the bulwarks of order . No man perhaps had more earnestly sought and more passionately striven for the fall of the Empire than Victor de Mauleon ; and perhaps no man was more dissatisfied and disappointed by the immediate consequences of that fall , In first conspiring against the Empire , he had naturally enough , in common with all the more intelligent enemies of the dynasty , presumed that its fate would be worked out by the normal effect of civil causes — the alienation of the educated classes , the discontent of the artisans , the eloquence of the press and of popular meetings , strengthened in proportion as the Emperor had been compelled to relax the former checks upon the license of either . And De Mauleon had no less naturally concluded that there would be time given for the preparation of a legitimate and rational form of government to succeed that which was destroyed . For , as has been hinted or implied , this remarkable man was not merely an instigator of revolution through the Secret Council , and the turbulent agencies set in movement through the lower strata of society;—he was also in confidential communication with men eminent for wealth , station , and political repute , from whom he obtained the funds necessary for the darker purposes of conspiracy , into the elaboration of which they did not inquire ; and these men , though belonging like himself to the Liberal party , were no hot - blooded democrats . Most of them were in favour of constitutional monarchy ; all of them for forms of government very different from any republic in which socialists or communists could find themselves uppermost . Among these politicians were persons ambitious and able , who , in scheming for the fall of the Empire , had been prepared to undertake the task of conducting to ends compatible with modern civilisation the revolution they were willing to allow a mob at Paris to commence . The opening of the war necessarily suspended their designs . How completely the events of the 4th September mocked the calculations of their ablest minds , and paralysed the action of their most energetic spirits , will appear in the conversation I am about to record . It takes place between Victor de Mauleon and the personage to whom he had addressed the letter written on the night before the interview with Louvier , in which Victor had announced his intention of reappearing in Paris in his proper name and rank . I shall designate this correspondent as vaguely as possible ; let me call him the Incognito . He may yet play so considerable a part in the history of France as a potent representative of the political philosophy of De Tocqueville — that is , of Liberal principles incompatible with the absolute power either of a sovereign or a populace , and resolutely opposed to experiments on the foundations of civilised society — that it would be unfair to himself and his partisans if , in a work like this , a word were said that could lead malignant conjecture to his identity with any special chief of the opinions of which I here present him only as a type . The Incognito , entering Victor ’s apartment : “

235979	236029	235961	235961	you	6890	” De Mauleon put his hand to his brow , and remained a few moments silent and thoughtful . At last he looked up with that decided expression of face which was not the least among his many attributes for influence over those with whom he came into contact . “
236200	236203	236244	236244	Victor	578	” INCOGNITO ( dejectedly).—“I
236332	236355	236359	236360	All Frenchmen	10348	” The man ’s voice broke down , and he turned aside , veiling his face with a hand that trembled . DE MAULEON—“Courage

236768	236789	236790	236790	I	0	” he added , and very quietly dilated on the renown of a patriot or the grave of a soldier . “
236798	236905	236790	236790	I	0	” said the Incognito ; and after a few more brief words he departed , his hat drawn over his brows , and entering a hired carriage which he had left at the corner of the quiet street , was consigned to the station du — — — — , just in time for the next train . Victor dressed and went out . The streets were crowded . Workmen were everywhere employed in the childish operation of removing all insignia , and obliterating all names that showed where an Empire had existed . One greasy citizen , mounted on a ladder , was effacing the words “
236909	236915	236906	236907	Boulevard Haussman	960	” and substituting for Haussman , “
236919	236992	236916	236917	Victor Hugo	511	” Suddenly De Mauleon came on a group of blouses , interspersed with women holding babies and ragged boys holding stones , collected round a well - dressed slender man , at whom they were hooting and gesticulating , with menaces of doing something much worse . By an easy effort of his strong frame the Vicomte pushed his way through the tormentors , and gave his arm to their intended victim . “
237003	237013	237014	237015	Another impertinent	6927	” Therewith the shrieks and shouts and gesticulations increased . “
237035	237062	237063	237064	Mes enfans	6930	” A burly fellow rushed forward , and the rest made a plunging push . The outstretched arm of De Mauleon kept the ringleader at bay . “
237066	237075	237063	237064	Mes enfans	6930	” cried Victor with a calm clear voice , “
237118	237174	237110	237111	Pierre Firmin	759	” Probably not one in the crowd had ever read a word written by Pierre Firmin , nor even heard of the name . But they did not like to own ignorance ; and that burly fellow did not like to encounter that arm of iron which touched his throat . So he cried out , “
237197	237198	237195	237195	Pierre	759	” “
237201	237215	237216	237217	the other	3321	” shrieked a virago , thrusting her baby into De Mauleon ’s face , “
237236	237254	237234	237234	him	759	” De Mauleon suddenly snatched the baby from her , and said , with imperturbable good temper , “
237270	237349	237265	237265	I	0	” No one who does not know the humours of a Parisian mob can comprehend the suddenness of popular change , or the magical mastery over crowds which is effected by quiet courage and a ready joke . The group was appeased at once . Even the virago laughed ; and when De Mauleon restored the infant to her arms , with a gold piece thrust into its tiny clasp , she eyed the gold , and cried , “
237356	237366	237352	237352	you	8507	” The two gentlemen made their way safely now . “
237371	237375	237376	237376	I	0	” said Duplessis , “

237854	237886	237849	237849	me	0	” De Mauleon continued his way through streets sometimes deserted , sometimes thronged . At the commencement of the Rue de Florentin he encountered the brothers Vandemar walking arm in arm . “
237892	237896	237889	237890	De Mauleon	597	” cried Enguerrand ; “
237905	237906	237907	237907	I	0	” “

237973	238020	238021	238021	Your	6983	” Here Raoul , who seemed absorbed in gloomy reflections , halted before the hotel in which the Contessa di Rimini lodged , and with a nod to his brother , and a polite , if not cordial salutation to Victor , entered the porte cochere . “
238042	238043	238044	238044	Raoul	574	” “
238127	238128	238118	238119	the fripon	6988	” “

238350	238528	238345	238345	I	0	” As Enguerrand said these simple words , his whole countenance , seemed changed . The crest rose ; his eyes sparkled ; the fair and delicate beauty which had made him the darling of women — the joyous sweetness of expression and dainty grace of high breeding which made him the most popular companion to men,—were exalted in a masculine nobleness of aspect , from which a painter might have taken hints for a study of the young Achilles separated for ever from effeminate companionship at the sight of the weapons of war . De Mauleon gazed on him admiringly . We have seen that he shared the sentiments uttered — had resolved on the same course of action . But it was with the tempered warmth of a man who seeks to divest his thoughts and his purpose of the ardour of romance , and who , in serving his country , calculates on the gains to his own ambition . Nevertheless he admired in Enguerrand the image of his own impulsive and fiery youth . “
238535	238539	238530	238530	you	7001	” resumed Enguerrand , “
238552	238553	238530	238530	you	7001	” “

238928	238932	238926	238926	Savarin	459	” said Victor ; “

239066	239067	239061	239061	you	459	” “
239078	239084	239070	239070	I	0	” answered De Mauleon thoughtfully . “
239103	239104	239090	239090	you	459	” “
239321	239322	239316	239317	Mademoiselle Cicogna	481	” “
239339	239343	239347	239347	her	1392	” exclaimed Enguerrand . “
239349	239354	239347	239347	her	1392	” answered De Mauleon , “
239364	239365	239347	239347	her	1392	” “
239373	239380	239368	239368	you	7039	” said Savarin , rather mournfully . “
239402	239563	239396	239400	reunis sons des meilleurs auspices	7043	” Here Savarin hurried off , and the other two men strolled into the Champs Elysees , which were crowded with loungers , gay and careless , as if there had been no disaster at Sedan , no overthrow of an Empire , no enemy on its road to Paris . In fact the Parisians , at once the most incredulous and the most credulous of all populations , believed that the Prussians would never be so impertinent as to come in sight of the gates . Something would occur to stop them ! The king had declared he did not war on Frenchmen , but on the Emperor : the Emperor gone , the war was over . A democratic republic was instituted . A horrible thing in its way , it is true ; but how could the Pandour tyrant brave the infection of democratic doctrines among his own barbarian armies ? Were not placards , addressed to our “
239567	239593	239396	239400	reunis sons des meilleurs auspices	7043	” posted upon the walls of Paris , exhorting the Pandours to fraternise with their fellow - creatures ? Was not Victor Hugo going to publish “
239600	239614	239396	239400	reunis sons des meilleurs auspices	7043	” ? Had not Jules Favre graciously offered peace , with the assurance that “
239642	239706	239707	239707	they	6826	” To all these , and many more such incontestable proofs , that the idea of a siege was moonshine , did Enguerrand and Victor listen as they joined group after group of their fellow - countrymen : nor did Paris cease to harbour such pleasing illusions , amusing itself with piously laying crowns at the foot of the statue of Strasbourg , swearing “
239716	239749	239707	239707	they	6826	” till on the 19th of September the last telegram was received , and Paris was cut of from the rest of the world by the iron line of the Prussian invaders . “
239754	239759	239760	239760	she	13	” says Victor Hugo , “
239771	240212	239631	239631	She	13	” We left Graham Vane slowly recovering from the attack of fever which had arrested his journey to Berlin in quest of the Count von Rudesheimn . He was , however , saved the prosecution of that journey , and his direction turned back to France by a German newspaper which informed him that the King of Prussia was at Rheims , and that the Count von Rudesheim was among the eminent personages gathered there around their sovereign . In conversing the same day with the kindly doctor who attended him , Graham ascertained that this German noble held a high command in the German armies , and bore a no less distinguished reputation as a wise political counsellor than he had earned as a military chief . As soon as he was able to travel , and indeed before the good doctor sanctioned his departure , Graham took his way to Rheims , uncertain , however , whether the Count would still be found there . I spare the details of his journey , interesting as they were . On reaching the famous and , in the eyes of Legitimists , the sacred city , the Englishman had no difficulty in ascertaining the house , not far from the cathedral , in which the Count von Rudesheim had taken his temporary abode . Walking towards it from the small hotel in which he had been lucky enough to find a room disengaged — slowly , for he was still feeble — he was struck by the quiet conduct of the German soldiery , and , save in their appearance , the peaceful aspect of the streets . Indeed , there was an air of festive gaiety about the place , as in an English town in which some popular regiment is quartered . The German soldiers thronged the shops , buying largely ; lounged into the cafes ; here and there attempted flirtations with the grisettes , who laughed at their French and blushed at their compliments ; and in their good - humoured , somewhat bashful cheeriness , there was no trace of the insolence of conquest . But as Graham neared the precincts of the cathedral his ear caught a grave and solemn music , which he at first supposed to come from within the building . But as he paused and looked round , he saw a group of the German military , on whose stalwart forms and fair manly earnest faces the setting sun cast its calm lingering rays . They were chanting , in voices not loud but deep , Luther ’s majestic hymn : “
240218	240250	239631	239631	She	13	” The chant awed even the ragged beggar boys who had followed the Englishman , as they followed any stranger , would have followed King William himself , whining for alms . “
240262	240266	239631	239631	She	13	” thought Graham ; “
240275	240498	239631	239631	She	13	” While thus meditating and listening , a man in a general ’s uniform came slowly out of the cathedral , with his hands clasped behind his back , and his head bent slightly downwards . He , too , paused on hearing the hymn ; then unclasped his hand and beckoned to one of the officers , to whom approaching he whispered a word or two , and passed on towards the Episcopal palace . The hymn hushed , and the singers quietly dispersed . Graham divined rightly that the general had thought a hymn thanking the God of battles might wound the feelings of the inhabitants of the vanquished city — not , however , that any of them were likely to understand the language in which the thanks were uttered . Graham followed the measured steps of the general , whose hands were again clasped behind his back — the musing habit of Von Moltke , as it had been of Napoleon the First . Continuing his way , the Englishman soon reached the house in which the Count von Rudesheim was lodged , and , sending in his card , was admitted at once through an anteroom in which sate two young men , subaltern officers apparently employed in draughting maps , into the presence of the Count . “
240502	240512	240500	240500	me	0	” said Graham , after the first conventional salutation , “
240541	240542	240514	240514	I	0	” “

240720	240728	240718	240718	Cicogna	973	” exclaimed Graham , turning very pale . “

241150	241151	241155	241155	he	7094	” “
241234	242331	241228	241232	such men holding such talk	7104	” After a few words more over the state of public affairs,—in which Graham expressed the English side of affairs , which was all for generosity to the vanquished ; and the Count argued much more ably on the German , which was all for security against the aggressions of a people that would not admit itself to be vanquished,—the short interview closed . As Graham at night pursued his journey to Vienna , there came into his mind Isaura ’s song of the Neapolitan fisherman . Had he , too , been blind to the image on the rock ? Was it possible that all the while he had been resisting the impulse of his heart , until the discharge of the mission entrusted to him freed his choice and decided his fortunes , the very person of whom he was in search had been before him , then to be for ever won , lost to him now for ever ? Could Isaura Cicogna be the child of Louise Duval by Richard King ? She could not have been her child by Cicogna : the dates forbade that hypothesis . Isaura must have been five years old when Louise married the Italian . Arrived at Milan , Graham quickly ascertained that the post to which Ludovico Cicogna had been removed was in Verona , and that he had there died eight years ago . Nothing was to be learned as to his family or his circumstances at the time of his death . The people of whose history we know the least are the relations we refuse to acknowledge . Graham continued his journey to Verona . There he found on inquiry that the Cicognas had occupied an apartment in a house which stood at the outskirts of the town and had been since pulled down to make way for some public improvements . But his closest inquiries could gain him no satisfactory answers to the all - important questions as to Ludovico Cicogna ’s family . His political alienation from the Italian cause , which was nowhere more ardently espoused than at Verona , had rendered him very unpopular . He visited at no Italian houses . Such society as he had was confined to the Austrian military within the Quadrilateral or at Venice , to which city he made frequent excursions : was said to lead there a free and gay life , very displeasing to the Signora , whom he left in Verona . She was but little seen , and faintly remembered as very handsome and proud - looking . Yes , there were children — a girl , and a boy several years younger than the girl ; but whether she was the child of the Signora by a former marriage , or whether the Signora was only the child ’s stepmother , no one could say . The usual clue , in such doubtful matters obtainable through servants , was here missing . The Cicognas had only kept two servants , and both were Austrian subjects , who had long left the country,—their very names forgotten . Graham now called to mind the Englishman Selby , for whom Isaura had such grateful affection , as supplying to her the place of her father . This must have been the Englishman whom Louise Duval had married after Cicogna ’s death . It would be no difficult task , surely , to ascertain where he had resided . Easy enough to ascertain all that Graham wanted to know from Isaura herself , if a letter could reach her . But , as he knew by the journals , Paris was now invested — cut off from all communication with the world beyond . Too irritable , anxious , and impatient to wait for the close of the siege , though he never suspected it could last so long as it did , he hastened to Venice , and there learned through the British consul that the late Mr. Selby was a learned antiquarian , an accomplished general scholar , a fanatico in music , a man of gentle temper though reserved manners ; had at one time lived much at Venice : after his marriage with the Signora Cicogna he had taken up his abode near Florence . To Florence Graham now went . He found the villa on the skirts of Fiesole at which Mr. Selby had resided . The peasant who had officiated as gardener and shareholder in the profits of vines and figs , was still , with his wife , living on the place . Both man and wife remembered the Inglese well ; spoke of him with great affection , of his wife with great dislike . They said her manners were very haughty , her temper very violent ; that she led the Inglese a very unhappy life ; that there were a girl and a boy , both hers by a former marriage ; but when closely questioned whether they were sure that the girl was the Signora ’s child by the former husband , or whether she was not the child of that husband by a former wife , they could not tell ; they could only say that both were called by the same name — Cicogna ; that the boy was the Signora ’s favourite — that indeed she seemed wrapt up in him ; that he died of a rapid decline a few months after Mr. Selby had hired the place , and that shortly after his death the Signora left the place and never returned to it ; that it was little more than a year that she had lived with her husband before this final separation took place . The girl remained with Mr. Selby , who cherished and loved her as his own child . Her Christian name was Isaura , the boy ’s Luigi . A few years later , Mr. Selby left the villa and went to Naples , where they heard he had died . They could give no information as to what had become of his wife : Since the death of her boy that lady had become very much changed — her spirits quite broken , no longer violent . She would sit alone and weep bitterly . The only person out of her family she would receive was the priest ; till the boy ’s death she had never seen the priest , nor been known to attend divine service . “

242358	242365	242355	242356	a saint	9144	” said the peasant ’s wife . “
242373	242380	242355	242356	a saint	9144	” said the peasant , drily ; “
242393	242447	242388	242388	they	7108	” On which remark the wife tried to box his ears . The contadino had become a freethinker since the accession of the house of Savoy . His wife remained a good Catholic . Said the peasant as , escaping from his wife , he walked into the high - road with Graham , “

242558	243029	242547	242548	The padre	7115	” Graham mused . The peasant ’s supposition was not improbable . A woman such as Louise Duval appeared to be — of vehement passions and ill - regulated mind — was just one of those who , in a moment of great sorrow , and estranged from the ordinary household affections , feel , though but imperfectly , the necessity of a religion , and , ever in extremes , pass at once from indifferentism into superstition . Arrived at Naples , Graham heard little of Selby except as a literary recluse , whose only distraction from books was the operatic stage . But he heard much of Isaura ; of the kindness which Madame de Grantmesnil had shown to her , when left by Selby ’s death alone in the world ; of the interest which the friendship and the warm eulogies of one so eminent as the great French writer had created for Isaura in the artistic circles ; of the intense sensation her appearance , her voice , her universal genius , had made in that society , and the brilliant hopes of her subsequent career on the stage the cognoscenti had formed . No one knew anything of her mother ; no one entertained a doubt that Isaura was by birth a Cicogna . Graham could not learn the present whereabouts of Madame de Grantmesnil . She had long left Naples , and had been last heard of at Genoa ; was supposed to have returned to France a little before the war . In France she had no fixed residence . The simplest mode of obtaining authentic information whether Isaura was the daughter of Ludovico Cicogna by his first wife — namely , by registration of her birth — failed him ; because , as von Rudesheim had said , his first wife was a Frenchwoman . The children had been born somewhere in France , no one could even guess where . No one had ever seen the first wife , who had never appeared in Italy , nor had even heard what was her maiden name . Graham , meanwhile , was not aware that Isaura was still in the besieged city , whether or not already married to Gustave Rameau ; so large a number of the women had quitted Paris before the siege began , that he had reason to hope she was among them . He heard through an American that the Morleys had gone to England before the Prussian investment ; perhaps Isaura had gone with them . He wrote to Mrs. Morley , inclosing his letter to the Minister of the United States at the Court of St. James ’s , and while still at Naples received her answer . It was short , and malignantly bitter . “
243199	244178	244179	244179	Lemercier	352	” On receipt of this letter , Graham quitted Naples , and shortly afterwards found himself at Versailles . He obtained permission to establish himself there , though the English were by no means popular . Thus near to Isaura , thus sternly separated from her , Graham awaited the close of the siege . Few among those at Versailles believed that the Parisians would endure it much longer . Surely they would capitulate before the bombardment , which the Germans themselves disliked to contemplate as a last resource , could commence . In his own mind Graham was convinced that Isaura was the child of Richard King . It seemed to him probable that Louise Duval , unable to assign any real name to the daughter of the marriage she disowned,—neither the name borne by the repudiated husband , nor her own maiden name,—would , on taking her daughter to her new home , have induced Cicogna to give the child his name , or that after Cicogna ’s death she herself had so designated the girl . A dispassionate confidant , could Graham have admitted any confidant whatever , might have suggested the more than equal probability that Isaura was Cicogna ’s daughter by his former espousal . But then what could have become of Richard King ’s child ? To part with the fortune in his hands , to relinquish all the ambitious dreams which belonged to it , cost Graham Vane no pang : but he writhed with indignant grief when he thought that the wealth of Richard King ’s heiress was to pass to the hands of Gustave Rameau,—that this was to be the end of his researches — this the result of the sacrifice his sense of honour imposed on him . And now that there was the probability that he must convey to Isaura this large inheritance , the practical difficulty of inventing some reason for such a donation , which he had , while at a distance made light of , became seriously apparent . How could he say to Isaura that he had L200,000 . in trust for her , without naming any one so devising it ? Still more , how constitute himself her guardian , so as to secure it to herself , independently of her husband ? Perhaps Isaura was too infatuated with Rameau , or too romantically unselfish , to permit the fortune so mysteriously conveyed being exclusively appropriated to herself . And if she were already married to Rameau , and if he were armed with the right to inquire into the source of this fortune , how exposed to the risks of disclosure would become the secret Graham sought to conceal . Such a secret affecting the memory of the sacred dead , affixing a shame on the scutcheon of the living , in the irreverent hands of a Gustave Rameau,—it was too dreadful to contemplate such a hazard . And yet , if Isaura were the missing heiress , could Graham Vane admit any excuse for basely withholding from her , for coolly retaining to himself the wealth for which he was responsible ? Yet , torturing as were these communings with himself , they were mild in their torture compared to the ever - growing anguish of the thought that in any case the only woman he had ever loved — ever could love,—who might but for his own scruples and prejudices have been the partner of his life , was perhaps now actually the wife of another , and , as such , in what terrible danger ! Famine within the walls of the doomed city : without , the engines of death waiting for a signal . So near to her , and yet so far ! So willing to die for her , if for her he could not live : and with all his devotion , all his intellect , all his wealth , so powerless ! It is now the middle of November - a Sunday . The day has been mild , and is drawing towards its close . The Parisians have been enjoying the sunshine . Under the leafless trees in the public gardens and the Champs Elysees children have been at play . On the Boulevards the old elegance of gaiety is succeeded by a livelier animation . Itinerant musicians gather round them ragged groups . Fortune - tellers are in great request , especially among the once brilliant Laises and Thaises , now looking more shabby , to whom they predict the speedy restoration of Nabobs and Russians , and golden joys . Yonder Punch is achieving a victory over the Evil One , who wears the Prussian spiked helmet , and whose face has been recently beautified into a resemblance to Bismarck . Punch draws to his show a laughing audience of Moblots and recruits to the new companies of the National Guard . Members of the once formidable police , now threadbare and hunger - pinched , stand side by side with unfortunate beggars and sinister - looking patriots who have served their time in the jails or galleys . Uniforms of all variety are conspicuous — the only evidence visible of an enemy at the walls . But the aspects of the wearers of warlike accoutrements are debonnaire and smiling , as of revellers on a holiday of peace . Among these defenders of their country , at the door of a crowded cafe , stands Frederic Lemercier , superb in the costume , bran - new , of a National Guard,—his dog Fox tranquilly reposing on its haunches , with eyes fixed upon its fellow - dog philosophically musing on the edge of Punch ’s show , whose master is engaged in the conquest of the Bismarck fiend . “
244181	244192	244179	244179	Lemercier	352	” cried the Vicomte de Breze , approaching the cafe , “

244296	244379	244286	244286	I	0	“ You have no right to be jealous . De Mauldon has had experience and won distinction in actual service , and from all I hear is doing wonders with his men — has got them not only to keep but to love drill . I heard no less an authority than General V — — say that if all the officers of the National Guard were like De Mauleon , that body would give an example of discipline to the line . ”
244380	244405	244266	244266	his	564	“ I say nothing as to the promotion of a real soldier like the Vicomte — but a Parisian dandy like Euguerrand de Vande — ”
244406	244422	244286	244286	I	0	“ You forget that Enguerrand received a military education — an advantage denied to you . ”
244423	244460	244286	244286	I	0	“ What does that matter ? Who cares for education nowadays ? Besides , have I not been training ever since the 4th of September , to say nothing of the hard work on the ramparts ? ”
244461	244782	244286	244286	I	0	“ Parlez moi de cela it is indeed hard work on the ramparts . Infandum dolorem quorum pars magna fui . Take the day duty . What with rising at seven o’clock , and being drilled between a middle - aged and corpulent grocer on one side and a meagre beardless barber ’s apprentice on the other ; what with going to the bastions at eleven , and seeing half one ’s companions drunk before twelve ; what with trying to keep their fists off one ’s face when one politely asks them not to call one ’s general a traitor or a poltroon,—the work of the ramparts would be insupportable , if I did not take a pack of cards with me , and enjoy a quiet rubber with three other heroes in some sequestered corner . As for night work , nothing short of the indomitable fortitude of a Parisian could sustain it ; the tents made expressly not to be waterproof , like the groves of the Muses , A fellow - companion of mine tucks himself up on my rug , and pillows his head on my knapsack . I remonstrate — he swears — the other heroes wake up and threaten to thrash us both ; and just when peace is made , and one hopes for a wink of sleep , a detachment of spectators , chiefly gamins , coming to see that all is safe in the camp , strike up the Marseillaise . Ah , the world will ring to the end of time with the sublime attitude of Paris in the face of the Vandal invaders , especially when it learns that the very shoes we stand in are made of cardboard . In vain we complain . The contractor for shoes is a staunch Republican , and jobs by right divine . May I ask if you have dined yet ? ”
244783	244835	244266	244266	his	564	“ Heavens ! no , it is too early . But I am excessively hungry . I had only a quarter of jugged cat for breakfast , and the brute was tough . In reply to your question , may I put another — Did you lay in plenty of stores ? ”
244836	244856	244286	244286	I	0	“ Stores ? no ; I am a bachelor , and rely on the stores of my married friends . ”
244857	244883	244286	244286	I	0	“ Poor De Breze ! I sympathise with you , for I am in the same boat , and dinner invitations have become monstrous rare . ”
244884	244911	244266	244266	his	564	“ Oh , but you are so confoundedly rich ! What to you are forty francs for a rabbit , or eighty francs for a turkey ? ”
244912	244945	244286	244286	I	0	“ Well , I suppose I am rich , but I have no money , and the ungrateful restaurants will not give me credit . They do n’t believe in better days . ”
244946	244953	244286	244286	I	0	“ How can you want money ? ”
244954	245136	244266	244266	his	564	“ Very naturally . I had invested my capital famously - the best speculations — partly in house rents , partly in company shares ; and houses pay no rents , and nobody will buy company shares . I had 1,000 napoleons on hand , it is true , when Duplessis left Paris — much more , I thought , than I could possibly need , for I never believed in the siege . But during the first few weeks I played at whist with bad luck , and since then so many old friends have borrowed of me that I doubt if I have 200 francs left . I have despatched four letters to Duplessis by pigeon and balloon , entreating him to send me 25,000 francs by some trusty fellow who will pierce the Prussian lines . I have had two answers : 1st , that he will find a man ; 2nd , that the man is found and on his way . Trust to that man , my dear friend , and meanwhile lend me 200 francs . ”
245137	245183	244286	244286	I	0	“ Mon cher , desole to refuse ; but I was about to ask you to share your 200 francs with me who live chiefly by my pen ; and that resource is cut off . Still , il faut vivre — one must dine . ”
245184	245212	244286	244286	I	0	“ That is a fact , and we will dine together to - day at my expense ; limited liability , though — eight francs a head . ”
245213	245230	244286	244286	I	0	“ Generous Monsieur , I accept . Meanwhile let us take a turn towards the Madeleine . ”
245251	245254	245256	245257	De Breze	514	“ Why , ”
245259	245269	245256	245257	De Breze	514	“ I thought you had left Paris with Madame . ”
245270	245425	244286	244286	I	0	“ So I did , and deposited her safely with the Morleys at Boulogne . These kind Americans were going to England , and they took her with them . But I quit Paris ! No : I am old ; I am growing obese . I have always been short - sighted . I can neither wield a sword nor handle a musket . But Paris needs defenders ; and every moment I was away from her I sighed to myself , ‘ il faut etre la ! ’ I returned before the Vandals had possessed themselves of our railways , the convoi overcrowded with men like myself , who had removed wives and families ; and when we asked each other why we went back , every answer was the same , ‘ il faut etre la . ’ No , poor child , no — I have nothing to give you . ”
245473	245497	245256	245257	De Breze	514	“ Monsieur , I did not stop you to ask for alms . You do not seem to remember me , M. Savarin . ”
245498	245503	245505	245505	Lemercier	352	“ But I do , ”
245507	245515	245505	245505	Lemercier	352	“ surely I address Mademoiselle Julie Caumartin . ”
245516	245526	245528	245528	Julie	585	“ Ah , excuse me , le petit Frederic , ”
245537	245547	245528	245528	Julie	585	“ I had no eyes except for M. Savarin . ”

245574	245605	245569	245569	She	585	“ Because you can give me news of that monster Gustave . It is not true , it can not be true , that he is going to be married ? ”
245606	245640	245528	245528	Julie	585	“ Nay , surely , Mademoiselle , all connection between you and young Rameau has ceased for months — ceased from the date of that illness in July which nearly carried him off . ”
245641	245652	245654	245655	the girl	9303	“ I resigned him to the care of his mother , ”
245657	245790	245654	245655	the girl	9303	“ but when he no longer needs a mother , he belongs to me . Oh , consider , M. Savarin , for his sake I refused the most splendid offers ! When he sought me , I had my coupe , my opera - box , my cachemires , my jewels . The Russians — the English — vied for my smiles . But I loved the man . I never loved before : I shall never love again ; and after the sacrifices I have made for him , nothing shall induce me to give him up . Tell me , I entreat , my dear M. Savarin , where he is hiding . He has left the parental roof , and they refused there to give me his address . ”
245791	245823	245528	245528	Julie	585	“ My poor girl , do n’t be mechante . It is quite true that Gustave Rameau is engaged to be married ; and any attempt of yours to create scandal — ”
245824	245827	245829	245829	Julie	585	“ Monsieur , ”
245833	245858	245829	245829	Julie	585	“ do n’t talk to me about scandal ! The man is mine , and no one else shall have him . His address ? ”
245859	245862	245864	245864	Savarin	431	“ Mademoiselle , ”
245868	245875	245864	245864	Savarin	431	“ find it out for yourself . ”
245897	245920	245889	245889	he	431	“ Come , come , ma belle enfant , be reasonable : Gustave is no loss . He is reduced to poverty . ”
245921	245961	245889	245889	he	431	“ So much the better . When he was well off I never cost him more than a supper at the Maison Doree ; and if he is poor he shall marry me , and I will support him ! ”
245962	245966	245889	245889	he	431	“ You!—and how ? ”
245967	246029	245889	245889	he	431	“ By my profession when peace comes ; and meanwhile I have offers from a cafe to recite warlike songs . Ah ! you shake your head incredulously . The ballet - dancer recite verses ? Yes ! he taught me to recite his own Soyez bon pour moi . M. Savarin ! do say where I can find mon homme . ”
246030	246033	245889	245889	he	431	“ No . ”
246034	246041	245889	245889	he	431	“ That is your last word ? ”
246042	246046	246047	246048	The girl	9303	“ It is . ”
246064	246078	246080	246081	De Breze	514	“ Is that the way you console yourself for the absence of Madame ? ”
246085	246088	246090	246090	Savarin	431	“ Fie ! ”
246094	246172	246090	246090	Savarin	431	“ such bad jokes are ill - timed . What strange mixtures of good and bad , of noble and base , every stratum of Paris life contains ! There is that poor girl , in one way contemptible , no doubt , and yet in another way she has an element of grandeur . On the whole , at Paris , the women , with all their faults , are of finer mould than the men . ”
246173	246182	246184	246184	Lemercier	352	“ French gallantry has always admitted that truth , ”

246241	246268	246233	246233	he	352	“ but there are so many snares for dogs at present . They are just coming into fashion for roasts , and Fox is so plump . ”
246269	246273	246275	246275	Savarin	431	“ I thought , ”
246277	246307	246275	246275	Savarin	431	“ that it was resolved at all the sporting clubs that , be the pinch of famine ever so keen , the friend of man should not be eaten . ”
246308	246345	246233	246233	he	352	“ That was while the beef lasted ; but since we have come to cats , who shall predict immunity to dogs ? Quid intactum nefasti linquimus ? Nothing is sacred from the hand of rapine . ”

246386	246396	246382	246382	Lemercier	352	“ but I am going to enter the church . ”
246397	246401	246403	246404	De Breze	514	“ To pray ? ”
246410	246433	246403	246404	De Breze	514	“ Not exactly ; but I want to speak to my friend Rochebriant , and I know I shall find him there . ”

246888	246931	246886	246886	he	431	“ and therefore free to depart . I must go and look up a former confrere who was an enthusiastic Red Republican , and I fear does not get so much to eat since he has no longer an Emperor to abuse . ”

247173	247203	246962	246962	Lemercier	352	“ I came from Brittany with a purse well filled . Of course I could have no scruples in accepting money from my destined father - in - law . ”

The incidents of war prevented that : he has a better plan now . The victory of the army of the Loire at Orleans opens a new enterprise . We shall cut our way through the Prussians , join that army , and with united forces fall on the enemy at the rear . Keep this a secret as yet , but rejoice with me that we shall prove to the invaders what men who fight for their native soil can do under the protection of Heaven . ”

247964	248036	248318	248318	he	7205	“ Thank you,—and to begin : I who know the world and mankind advise you , who do not , never to meet a man who wishes to do you a kindness with an ungracious sarcasm . Irony is a weapon I ought to be skilled in , but weapons are used against enemies , and it is only a tyro who flourishes his rapier in the face of his friends . ”
248037	248055	248318	248318	he	7205	“ I was not aware that M. Savarin still permitted me to regard him as a friend . ”
248056	248314	248318	248318	he	7205	“ Because I discharged the duties of friend — remonstrated , advised , and warned . However , let bygones be bygones . I entreated you not to quit the safe shelter of the paternal roof . You insisted on doing so . I entreated you not to send to one of the most ferocious of the Red , or rather , the Communistic , journals , articles , very eloquent , no doubt , but which would most seriously injure you in the eyes of quiet , orderly people , and compromise your future literary career for the sake of a temporary flash in the pan during a very evanescent period of revolutionary excitement . You scorned my adjurations , but at all events you had the grace not to append your true name to those truculent effusions . In literature , if literature revive in France , we two are henceforth separated . But I do not forego the friendly interest I took in you in the days when you were so continually in my house . My wife , who liked you so cordially , implored me to look after you during her absence from Paris , and , enfin , mon pauvre garcon , it would grieve me very much if , when she comes back , I had to say to her , ‘ Gustave Rameau has thrown away the chance of redemption and of happiness which you deemed was secure to him . ’ A l’oeil malade , la lumiere nuit . ”
248348	248367	248325	248325	Gustave	551	“ Forgive me if I have been ungracious , M. Savarin , and vouchsafe to hear my explanation . ”
248368	248374	248318	248318	he	7205	“ Willingly , mon garcon . ”
248375	248423	248318	248318	he	7205	“ When I became convalescent , well enough to leave my father ’s house , there were circumstances which compelled me to do so . A young man accustomed to the life of a garcon ca n’t be always tied to his mother ’s apron - strings . ”
248424	248439	248441	248441	Savarin	431	“ Especially if the apron - pocket does not contain a bottle of absinthe , ”
248445	248555	248441	248441	Savarin	431	“ You may well colour and try to look angry ; but I know that the doctor strictly forbade the use of that deadly liqueur , and enjoined your mother to keep strict watch on your liability to its temptations . And hence one cause of your ennui under the paternal roof . But if there you could not imbibe absinthe , you were privileged to enjoy a much diviner intoxication . There you could have the foretaste of domestic bliss,—the society of the girl you loved , and who was pledged to become your wife . Speak frankly . Did not that society itself begin to be wearisome ? ”
248556	248559	248561	248561	Gustave	551	“ No , ”
248565	248571	248561	248561	Gustave	551	“ it was not wearisome — ”
248572	248577	248318	248318	he	7205	“ Yes , but — ”
248578	248595	248318	248318	he	7205	“ But it could not be all - sufficing to a soul of fire like mine . ”
248596	248599	248561	248561	Gustave	551	“ Hem , ”
248601	248615	248318	248318	he	7205	Savarin—“a soul of fire ! This is very interesting ; pray go on . ”
248616	248696	248318	248318	he	7205	“ The calm , cold , sister - like affection of a childish undeveloped nature , which knew no passion except for art , and was really so little emancipated from the nursery as to take for serious truth all the old myths of religion — such companionship may be very soothing and pleasant when one is lying on one ’s sofa , and must live by rule , but when one regains the vigour of youth and health — ”
248697	248702	248704	248704	Savarin	431	“ Do not pause , ”
248721	248738	248704	248704	Savarin	431	“ When one regains that vigour of which I myself have no recollection , what happens ? ”
248739	248762	248318	248318	he	7205	“ The thirst for excitement , the goads of ambition , the irresistible claims which the world urges upon genius , return . ”
248763	248845	248318	248318	he	7205	“ And that genius , finding itself at the North Pole amid Cimmerian darkness in the atmosphere of a childish intellect — in other words , the society of a pure - minded virgin , who , though a good romance - writer , writes nothing but what a virgin may read , and , though a bel esprit , says her prayers and goes to church — then genius — well , pardon my ignorance , what does genius do ? ”
248846	248905	248704	248704	Savarin	431	“ Oh , M. Savarin , M. Savarin ! do n’t let us talk any more . There is no sympathy between us . I can not bear that bloodless , mocking , cynical mode of dealing with grand emotions , which belongs to the generation of the Doctrinaires . I am not a Thiers or a Guizot . ”
248906	249073	248318	248318	he	7205	“ Good heavens ! who ever accused you of being either ? I did not mean to be cynical . Mademoiselle Cicogna has often said I am , but I did not think you would . Pardon me . I quite agree with the philosopher who asserted that the wisdom of the past was an imposture , that the meanest intellect now living is wiser than the greatest intellect which is buried in Pere la Chaise ; because the dwarf who follows the giant , when perched on the shoulders of the giant , sees farther than the giant ever could . Allez . I go in for your generation . I abandon Guizot and Thiers . Do condescend and explain to my dull understanding , as the inferior mortal of a former age , what are the grand emotions which impel a soul of fire in your wiser generation . The thirst of excitement — what excitement ? The goads of ambition — what ambition ? ”
249074	249139	248318	248318	he	7205	“ A new social system is struggling from the dissolving elements of the old one , as , in the fables of priestcraft , the soul frees itself from the body which has become ripe for the grave . Of that new system I aspire to be a champion — a leader . Behold the excitement that allures me , the ambition that goads . ”
249140	249144	249146	249146	Savarin	431	“ Thank you , ”
249150	249225	249146	249146	Savarin	431	“ I am answered . I recognise the dwarf perched on the back of the giant . Quitting these lofty themes , I venture to address to you now one simple matter - of - fact question : How about Mademoiselle Cicogna ? Do you think you can induce her to transplant herself to the new social system , which I presume will abolish , among other obsolete myths , the institution of marriage ? ”
249226	249308	248318	248318	he	7205	“ M. Savarin , your question offends me . Theoretically I am opposed to the existing superstitions that encumber the very simple principle by which may be united two persons so long as they desire the union , and separated so soon as the union becomes distasteful to either . But I am perfectly aware that such theories would revolt a young lady like Mademoiselle Cicogna . I have never even named them to her , and our engagement holds good . ”
249309	249321	248318	248318	he	7205	“ Engagement of marriage ? No period for the ceremony fixed ? ”
249322	249345	249146	249146	Savarin	431	“ That is not my fault . I urged it on Isaura with all earnestness before I left my father ’s house . ”
249346	249684	248318	248318	he	7205	“ That was long after the siege had begun . Listen to me , Gustave . No persuasion of mine or my wife ’s , nor Mrs. Morley ’s , could induce Isaura to quit Paris while it was yet time . She said very simply that , having pledged her truth and hand to you , it would be treason to honour and duty if she should allow any considerations for herself to be even discussed so long as you needed her presence . You were then still suffering , and , though convalescent , not without danger of a relapse . And your mother said to her — I heard the words : ‘ ‘ Tis not for his bodily health I could dare to ask you to stay , when every man who can afford it is sending away his wife , sisters , daughters . As for that , I should suffice to tend him ; but if you go , I resign all hope for the health of his mind and his soul . ’ I think at Paris there may be female poets and artists whom that sort of argument would not have much influenced . But it so happens that Isaura is not a Parisienne . She believes in those old myths which you think fatal to sympathies with yourself ; and those old myths also lead her to believe that where a woman has promised she will devote her life to a man , she can not forsake him when told by his mother that she is necessary to the health of his mind and his soul . Stay . Before you interrupt me , let me finish what I have to say . It appears that , so soon as your bodily health was improved , you felt that your mind and your soul could take care of themselves ; and certainly it seems to me that Isaura Cicogna is no longer of the smallest use to either . ”
249999	250002	250033	250033	he	551	“ comforts ; ”
250225	250534	250222	250222	he	551	“ You do me great injustice if you suppose that the occupations to which I devote myself render me less sensible to the merits of Mademoiselle Cicogna , or less eager for our union . On the contrary , I will confide to you — as a man of the world — one main reason why I quitted my father ’s house , and why I desire to keep my present address a secret . Mademoiselle Caumartin conceived for me a passion — a caprice — which was very flattering for a time , but which latterly became very troublesome . Figure to yourself — she daily came to our house while I was lying ill , and with the greatest difficulty my mother got her out of it . That was not all . She pestered me with letters containing all sorts of threats — nay , actually kept watch at the house ; and one day when I entered the carriage with my mother and Signora Venosta for a drive in the Bois ( meaning to call for Isaura by the way ) , she darted to the carriage - door , caught my hand , and would have made a scene if the coachman had given her leave to do so . Luckily he had the tact to whip on his horses , and we escaped . I had some little difficulty in convincing the Signora Venosta that the girl was crazed . But I felt the danger I incurred of her coming upon me some moment when in company with Isaura , and so I left my father ’s house ; and naturally wishing to steer clear of this vehement little demon till I am safely married , I keep my address a secret from all who are likely to tell her of it . ”
250535	250591	250222	250222	he	551	“ You do wisely if you are really afraid of her , and can not trust your nerves to say to her plainly , ‘ I am engaged to be married ; all is at an end between us . Do not force me to employ the police to protect myself from unwelcome importunities . ’ ”
250592	250641	250676	250676	Savarin	431	“ Honestly speaking , I doubt if I have the nerve to do that , and I doubt still more if it would be of any avail . It is very ennuayant to be so passionately loved ; but , que voulez vous ? It is my fate . ”
250642	250674	250222	250222	he	551	“ Poor martyr ! I condole with you : and , to say truth , it was chiefly to warn you of Mademoiselle Caumartin ’s pertinacity that I call this evening . ”
250691	250836	250676	250676	Savarin	431	“ I suppose I may take your word of honour that you will firmly resist all temptation to renew a connection which would be so incompatible with the respect due to your fiancee ? Fatherless and protectorless as Isaura is , I feel bound to act as a virtual guardian to one in whom my wife takes so deep an interest , and to whom , as she thinks , she had some hand in bringing about your engagement : she is committed to no small responsibilities . Do not allow poor Julie , whom I sincerely pity , to force on me the unpleasant duty of warning your fiancee of the dangers to which she might be subjected by marriage with an Adonis whose fate it is to be so profoundly beloved by the sex in general , and ballet nymphs in particular . ”
250837	250869	250222	250222	he	551	“ There is no chance of so disagreeable a duty being incumbent on you , M. Savarin . Of course , what I myself have told you in confidence is sacred . ”
250870	250955	250676	250676	Savarin	431	“ Certainly . There are things in the life of a garcon before marriage which would be an affront to the modesty of his fiancee to communicate and discuss . But then those things must belong exclusively to the past and cast no shadow over the future . I will not interrupt you further . No doubt you have work for the night before you . Do the Red journalists for whom you write pay enough to support you in these terribly dear times ? ”
250956	250974	251041	251041	she	454	“ Scarcely . But I look forward to wealth and fame in the future . And you ? ”
250975	251004	250676	250676	Savarin	431	“ I just escape starvation . If the siege last much longer , it is not of the gout I shall die . Good - night to you . ”
251869	252043	251863	251863	she	454	“ One day at Enghien I listened silently to a conversation between M. Savarin and the Englishman , who sought to explain the conception of duty in which the German poet has given such noble utterance to the thoughts of the German philosopher — viz . , that moral aspiration has the same goal as the artistic,—the attainment to the calm delight wherein the pain of effort disappears in the content of achievement . Thus in life , as in art , it is through discipline that we arrive at freedom , and duty only completes itself when all motives , all actions , are attuned into one harmonious whole , and it is not striven for as duty , but enjoyed as happiness . M. Savarin treated this theory with the mockery with which the French wit is ever apt to treat what it terms German mysticism . According to him , duty must always be a hard and difficult struggle ; and he said laughingly , ‘ Whenever a man says , “
252050	252063	252044	252044	I	0	” it is with a long face and a mournful sigh . ’ “
252182	252498	252499	252499	Gustave	551	“ Madame Rameau is very angry with her son for his neglect both of his parents and of me . I have had to take his part against her . I would not have him lose their love . Poor Gustave ! But when Madame Rameau suddenly said to - day : ‘ I erred in seeking the union between thee and Gustave . Retract thy promise ; in doing so thou wilt be justified,’—oh , the strange joy that flashed upon me as she spoke . Am I justified ? Am I ? Oh , if that Englishman had never crossed my path ! Oh , if I had never loved ! or if in the last time we met he had not asked for my love , and confessed his own ! Then , I think , I could honestly reconcile my conscience with my longings , and say to Gustave , ‘ We do not suit each other ; be we both released ! ’ But now - is it that Gustave is really changed from what he was , when in despondence at my own lot , and in pitying belief that I might brighten and exalt his , I plighted my troth to him ? or is it not rather that the choice I thus voluntarily made became so intolerable a thought the moment I knew I was beloved and sought by another ; and from that moment I lost the strength I had before,—strength to silence the voice at my own heart ? What ! is it the image of that other one which is persuading me to be false?—to exaggerate the failings , to be blind to the merits of him who has a right to say , ‘ I am what I was when thou didst pledge thyself to take me for better or for worse ’ ? “
252645	252699	252716	252716	he	551	“ The Abbe replied with unalterable good - humour , ‘ But , in order to criticise the effects of drunkenness , must one get drunk one ’s self ? ’ Gustave was put out , and retired into a corner of the room , keeping sullen silence till my other visitors left . “
252769	253005	253014	253014	his	7269	“ If Gustave were of stronger nature and more concentrated will , I believe that the only feelings I should have for him would be antipathy and dread . But it is his very weaknesses and inconsistencies that secure to him a certain tenderness of interest . I think he could never be judged without great indulgence by women ; there is in him so much of the child,—wayward , irritating one moment , and the next penitent , affectionate . One feels as if persistence in evil were impossible to one so delicate both in mind and form . That peculiar order of genius to which he belongs seems as if it ought to be so estranged from all directions , violent or coarse . When in poetry he seeks to utter some audacious and defying sentiment , the substance melts away in daintiness of expression , in soft , lute - like strains of slender music . And when he has stung , angered , revolted my heart the most , suddenly he subsides into such pathetic gentleness , such tearful remorse , that I feel as if resentment to one so helpless , desertion of one who must fall without the support of a friendly hand , were a selfish cruelty . It seems to me as if I were dragged towards a precipice by a sickly child clinging to my robe . “
253266	253406	253251	253251	he	7269	“ I wished to speak sternly ; but it is my great misfortune , my prevalent weakness , that I can not be stern when I ought to be . It is with me in life as in art . I never could on the stage have taken the part of a Norma or a Medea . If I attempt in fiction a character which deserves condemnation , I am untrue to poetic justice . I can not condemn and execute ; I can but compassionate and pardon the creature I myself have created . I was never in the real world stern but to one ; and then , alas ! it was because I loved where I could no longer love with honour ; and I , knowing my weakness , had terror lest I should yield . “
253477	254397	253460	253460	he	551	” It is true that Isaura had come more directly under the influence of religion than she had been in the earlier dates of this narrative . There is a time in the lives of most of us , and especially in the lives of women , when , despondent of all joy in an earthly future , and tortured by conflicts between inclination and duty , we transfer all the passion and fervour of our troubled souls to enthusiastic yearnings for the Divine Love ; seeking to rebaptise ourselves in the fountain of its mercy , taking thence the only hopes that can cheer , the only strength that can sustain us . Such a time had come to Isaura . Formerly she had escaped from the griefs of the work - a - day world into the garden - land of Art . Now , Art had grown unwelcome to her , almost hateful . Gone was the spell from the garden - land ; its flowers were faded , its paths were stony , its sunshine had vanished in mist and rain . There are two voices of Nature in the soul of the genuine artist,—that is , of him who , because he can create , comprehends the necessity of the great Creator . Those voices are never both silent . When one is hushed , the other becomes distinctly audible . The one speaks to him of Art , the other of Religion . At that period several societies for the relief and tendance of the wounded had been formed by the women of Paris,—the earliest , if I mistake not , by ladies of the highest rank — amongst whom were the Comtesse de Vandemar and the Contessa di Rimini — though it necessarily included others of stations less elevated . To this society , at the request of Alain de Rochebriant and of Enguerrand , Isaura had eagerly attached herself . It occupied much of her time ; and in connection with it she was brought much into sympathetic acquaintance with Raoul de Vandemar — the most zealous and active member of that Society of St. Francois de Sales , to which belonged other young nobles of the Legitimist creed . The passion of Raoul ’s life was the relief of human suffering . In him was personified the ideal of Christian charity . I think all , or most of us , have known what it is to pass under the influence of a nature that is so far akin to ours that it desires to become something better and higher than it is — that desire being paramount in ourselves — but seeks to be that something in ways not akin to , but remote from , the ways in which we seek it . When this contact happens , either one nature , by the mere force of will , subjugates and absorbs the other , or both , while preserving their own individuality , apart and independent , enrich themselves by mutual interchange , and the asperities which differences of taste and sentiment in detail might otherwise provoke melt in the sympathy which unites spirits striving with equal earnestness to rise nearer to the unseen and unattainable Source , which they equally recognise as Divine . Perhaps , had these two persons met a year ago in the ordinary intercourse of the world , neither would have detected the sympathy of which I speak . Raoul was not without the prejudice against artists and writers of romance , that is shared by many who cherish the persuasion that all is vanity which does not concentrate imagination and intellect in the destinies of the soul hereafter ; and Isaura might have excited his compassion , certainly not his reverence . While to her , his views on all that seeks to render the actual life attractive and embellished , through the accomplishments of Muse and Grace , would have seemed the narrow - minded asceticism of a bigot . But now , amid the direful calamities of the time , the beauty of both natures became visible to each . To the eyes of Isaura tenderness became predominant in the monastic self - denial of Raoul . To the eyes of Raoul , devotion became predominant in the gentle thoughtfulness of Isaura . Their intercourse was in ambulance and hospital - in care for the wounded , in prayer for the dying . Ah ! it is easy to declaim against the frivolities and vices of Parisian society as they appear on the surface ; and , in revolutionary times , it is the very worst of Paris that ascends in scum to the top . But descend below the surface , even in that demoralising suspense of order , and nowhere on earth might the angel have beheld the image of humanity more amply vindicating its claim to the heritage of heaven . The warning announcement of some great effort on the part of the besieged , which Alain had given to Lemercier , was soon to be fulfilled . For some days the principal thoroughfares were ominously lined with military convois . The loungers on the Boulevards stopped to gaze on the long defiles of troops and cannons , commissariat conveyances , and , saddening accompaniments ! the vehicles of various ambulances for the removal of the wounded . With what glee the loungers said to each other “
254400	254481	253460	253460	he	551	” Among all the troops that Paris sent forth , none were so popular as those which Paris had not nurtured — the sailors . From the moment they arrived , the sailors had been the pets of the capital . They soon proved themselves the most notable contrast to that force which Paris herself had produced — the National Guard . Their frames were hardy , their habits active , their discipline perfect , their manners mild and polite . “
254492	254529	253460	253460	he	551	” was the common exclamation of the Parisians . At last burst forth upon Paris the proclamations of General Trochu and General Ducrot ; the first brief , calm , and Breton - like , ending with “
254542	254620	253460	253460	he	551	” the second more detailed , more candidly stating obstacles and difficulties , but fiery with eloquent enthusiasm , not unsupported by military statistics , in the 400 cannon , two - thirds of which were of the largest calibre , that no material object could resist ; more than 150,000 soldiers , all well armed , well equipped , abundantly provided with munitions , and all ( j’en a l’espoir ) animated by an irresistible ardour . “
254624	254629	254630	254630	I	0	” concludes the General , “
254658	254931	254634	254634	I	0	” At these proclamations , who then at Paris does not recall the burst of enthusiasm that stirred the surface ? Trochu became once more popular ; even the Communistic or atheistic journals refrained from complaining that he attended mass , and invited his countrymen to trust in God . Ducrot was more than popular — he was adored . The several companies in which De Mauleon and Enguerrand served departed towards their post early on the same morning , that of the 28th . All the previous night , while Enguerrand was buried in profound slumber , Raoul remained in his brother ’s room ; sometimes on his knees before the ivory crucifix which had been their mother ’s last birthday gift to her youngest son — sometimes seated beside the bed in profound and devout meditation . At daybreak , Madame de Vandemar stole into the chamber . Unconscious of his brother ’s watch , he had asked her to wake him in good time , for the young man was a sound sleeper . Shading the candle she bore with one hand , with the other she drew aside the curtain , and looked at Enguerrand ’s calm fair face , its lips parted in the happy smile which seemed to carry joy with it wherever its sunshine played . Her tears fell noiselessly on her darling ’s cheek ; she then knelt down and prayed for strength . As she rose she felt Raoul ’s arm around her ; they looked at each other in silence ; then she bowed her head and wakened Enguerrand with her lips . “
254939	254950	254936	254936	mes	7284	” he murmured , opening his sweet blue eyes drowsily . “
255017	255018	255020	255020	thee	574	” “
255028	255047	255023	255023	thee	574	” cried the mother , wrapping her arms passionately round him , and in tones choked with sobs . “
255054	255073	255074	255074	Raoul	574	” said Enguerrand , resorting to the infantine ordinary name , which he had not used for years . “
255118	255144	255272	255272	She	11441	” Enguerrand , always careful of each detail of dress , was especially so that morning , and especially gay , humming the old air , “
255150	255271	255272	255272	She	11441	” But his gaiety was checked when Raoul , taking from his breast a holy talisman , which he habitually wore there , suspended it with loving hands round his brother ’s neck . It was a small crystal set in Byzantine filigree ; imbedded in it was a small splinter of wood , said by pious tradition to be a relic of the Divine Cross . It had been for centuries in the family of the Contessa di Rimini , and was given by her to Raoul , the only gift she had ever made him , as an emblem of the sinless purity of the affection that united those two souls in the bonds of the beautiful belief . “
255286	255292	255272	255272	She	11441	” said Raoul , simply ; “
255308	255324	255298	255298	I	0	” Enguerrand clasped his brother in his arms , and kissed him with passionate fervour . “
255383	255384	255389	255389	Enguerrand	564	” “
255412	255437	255439	255439	us	7297	” and uttering these words , he led Enguerrand towards the crucifix , and there , in deeper and more solemn voice , said , “
255442	256000	256001	256001	I	0	” So the brothers knelt side by side , and Raoul prayed aloud as only such souls can pray . When they descended into the salon where breakfast was set out , they found assembled several of their relations , and some of Enguerrand ’s young friends not engaged in the sortie . One or two of the latter , indeed , were disabled from fighting by wounds in former fields ; they left their sick - beds to bid him good - bye . Unspeakable was the affection this genial nature inspired in all who came into the circle of its winning magic ; and when , tearing himself from them , he descended the stair , and passed with light step through the Porte cochere , there was a crowd around the house — so widely had his popularity spread among even the lower classes , from which the Mobiles in his regiment were chiefly composed . He departed to the place of rendezvous amid a chorus of exhilarating cheers . Not thus lovingly tended on , not thus cordially greeted , was that equal idol of a former generation , Victor de Mauleon . No pious friend prayed beside his couch , no loving kiss waked him from his slumbers . At the grey of the November dawn he rose from a sleep which had no smiling dreams , with that mysterious instinct of punctual will which can not even go to sleep without fixing beforehand the exact moment in which sleep shall end . He , too , like Enguerrand , dressed himself with care — unlike Enguerrand , with care strictly soldier - like . Then , seeing he had some little time yet before him , he rapidly revisited the pigeonholes and drawers in which might be found by prying eyes anything he would deny to them curiosity . All that he found of this sort were some letters in female handwriting , tied together with faded ribbon , relics of earlier days , and treasured throughout later vicissitudes ; letters from the English girl to whom he had briefly referred in his confession to Louvier,—the only girl he had ever wooed as his wife . She was the only daughter of highborn Roman Catholics , residing at the time of his youth in Paris . Reluctantly they had assented to his proposals ; joyfully they had retracted their assent when his affairs had become so involved ; yet possibly the motive that led him to his most ruinous excesses — the gambling of the turf — had been caused by the wild hope of a nature , then fatally sanguine , to retrieve the fortune that might suffice to satisfy the parents . But during his permitted courtship the lovers had corresponded . Her letters were full of warm , if innocent , tenderness — till came the last cold farewell . The family had long ago returned to England ; he concluded , of course , that she had married another . Near to these letters lay the papers which had served to vindicate his honour in that old affair , in which the unsought love of another had brought on him shame and affliction . As his eye fell on the last , he muttered to him self , “
256054	256253	256254	256254	My	0	” He pressed his lips to the letters with a passionate , lingering , mournful kiss ; then , raking up the ashes of yesterday ’s fire , and rekindling them , he placed thereon those leaves of a melancholy romance in his past , and watched them slowly , reluctantly smoulder away into tinder . Then he opened a drawer in which lay the only paper of a political character which he had preserved . All that related to plots or conspiracies in which his agency had committed others , it was his habit to destroy as soon as received . For the sole document thus treasured he alone was responsible ; it was an outline of his ideal for the future constitution of France , accompanied with elaborate arguments , the heads of which his conversation with the Incognito made known to the reader . Of the soundness of this political programme , whatever its merits or faults ( a question on which I presume no judgment ) , he had an intense conviction . He glanced rapidly over its contents , did not alter a word , sealed it up in an envelope , inscribed , “
256260	256561	256254	256254	My	0	” The papers refuting a calumny relating solely to himself he carried into the battle - field , placed next to his heart,—significant of a Frenchman ’s love of honour in this world — as the relic placed round the neck of Enguerrand by his pious brother was emblematic of the Christian hope of mercy in the next . The streets swarmed with the populace troops as they passed to their destination . Among those of the Mobiles who especially caught the eye were two companies in which Enguerrand de Vandemar and Victor de Mauleon commanded . In the first were many young men of good family , or in the higher ranks of the bourgeoisie , known to numerous lookers - on ; there was something inspiriting in their gay aspects , and in the easy carelessness of their march . Mixed with this company , however , and forming of course the bulk of it , were those who belonged to the lower classes of the population ; and though they too might seem gay to an ordinary observer , the gaiety was forced . Many of them were evidently not quite sober ; and there was a disorderly want of soldiership in their mien and armament which inspired distrust among such vieux moustaches as , too old for other service than that of the ramparts , mixed here and there among the crowd . But when De Mauleon ’s company passed , the vieux moustaches impulsively touched each other . They recognised the march of well - drilled men ; the countenances grave and severe , the eyes not looking on this side and that for admiration , the step regularly timed ; and conspicuous among these men the tall stature and calm front of the leader . “
256568	256574	256254	256254	My	0	” growled a vieux moustache , “
256583	256584	256577	256577	they	7302	” “
256590	256595	256596	256598	Victor de Mauleon	578	” said a bourgeois . “
256626	256627	256611	256611	him	578	” “
256642	256684	256628	256628	I	0	” growled again le vieux moustache . One incessant roar of cannon all the night of the 29th . The populace had learned the names of the French cannons , and fancied they could distinguish the several sounds of their thunder . “
256691	256697	256688	256688	Josephine	1000	” shouts an invalid sailor . “
256706	256714	256688	256688	Josephine	1000	” cries a Red Republican from Belleville . “
256722	257051	256688	256688	Josephine	1000	” laughed Gustave Rameau , who was now become an enthusiastic admirer of the Victor Hugo he had before affected to despise . And all the while , mingled with the roar of the cannon , came , far and near from the streets , from the ramparts , the gusts of song — song sometimes heroic , sometimes obscene , more often carelessly joyous . The news of General Vinoy ’s success during the early part of the day had been damped by the evening report of Ducrot ’s delay in crossing the swollen Marne . But the spirits of the Parisians rallied from a momentary depression on the excitement at night of that concert of martial music . During that night , close under the guns of the double redoubt of Gravelle and La Faisanderie , eight pontoon - bridges were thrown over the Marne ; and at daybreak the first column of the third army under Blanchard and Renoult crossed with all their artillery , and , covered by the fire of the double redoubts , of the forts of Vincennes , Nogent , Rossuey , and the batteries of Mont Avron , had an hour before noon carried the village of Champingy , and the first echelon of the important plateau of Villiers , and were already commencing the work of intrenchment , when , rallying from the amaze of a defeat , the German forces burst upon them , sustained by fresh batteries . The Prussian pieces of artillery established at Chennevieres and at Neuilly opened fire with deadly execution ; while a numerous infantry , descending from the intrenchments of Villiers , charged upon the troops under Renoult . Among the French in that strife were Enguerrand and the Mobiles of which he was in command . Dismayed by the unexpected fire , these Mobiles gave way , as indeed did many of the line . Enguerrand rushed forward to the front : “
257076	257108	257110	257110	you	7313	” Among those of the better class in that company there rose a shout of applause , but it found no sympathy among the rest . They wavered , they turned . “
257120	257148	257110	257110	you	7313	” cried Enguerrand ; and alone he rushed on towards the Prussian line — rushed , and fell , mortally wounded , by a musket - ball . “
257153	257160	257110	257110	you	7313	” shouted some of the foremost ; “
257163	257205	257206	257206	Poltroons	1003	” shouted those in the rear ; and , so shouting , turned on their heels and fled . But ere they could disperse they encountered the march , steadfast though rapid , of the troop led by Victor de Mauleon . “
257208	257221	257206	257206	Poltroons	1003	” he thundered , with the sonorous depth of his strong voice , “
257236	257237	257238	257238	Va	953	” “
257242	257277	257238	257238	Va	953	” said one fugitive , an officer - popularly elected , because he was the loudest brawler in the club of the Salle Favre,—we have seen him before — Charles , the brother of Armand Monnier;—“men
257298	257299	257295	257296	fools both	7322	” “
257309	257375	257295	257296	fools both	7322	” cried De Mauldon , and shot the man dead . His followers , startled and cowed by the deed , and the voice and the look of the death - giver , halted . The officers , who had at first yielded to the panic of their men , took fresh courage , and finally led the bulk of the troop back to their post “
257381	257534	257295	257296	fools both	7322	” to use the phrase of a candid historian of that day . Day , on the whole , not inglorious to France . It was the first , if it was the last , really important success of the besieged . They remained masters of the ground , the Prussians leaving to them the wounded and the dead . That night what crowds thronged from Paris to the top of the Montmartre heights , from the observatory on which the celebrated inventor Bazin had lighted up , with some magical electric machine , all the plain of Gennevilliers from Mont Valerien to the Fort de la Briche ! The splendour of the blaze wrapped the great city;—distinctly above the roofs of the houses soared the Dome des Invalides , the spires of Notre Dame , the giant turrets of the Tuileries;—and died away on resting on the infames scapulos Acroceraunia , the “
257537	257600	257295	257296	fools both	7322	” of the heights occupied by the invading army . Lemercier , De Breze , and the elder Rameau — who , despite his peaceful habits and grey hairs , insisted on joining in the aid of la patrie — were among the National Guards attached to the Fort de la Briche and the neighbouring eminence , and they met in conversation . “
257608	257614	257621	257622	M. Rameau	551	” said the old Rameau . “
257624	257628	257621	257622	M. Rameau	551	” said LeMercier . “
257645	257646	257642	257642	you	7325	” “
257665	257666	257653	257654	M. Gustave	551	” “
257677	257682	257671	257671	you	7325	” asked De Breze . “
258090	258335	258066	258066	I	0	“ When the hubbub had subsided , your son , M. Rameau , proceeded , quitting mankind in general , and arriving at the question in particular most interesting to his audience — the mobilisation of the National Guard ; that is , the call upon men who like talking and hate fighting to talk less and fight more . ‘ It was the sheerest tyranny to select a certain number of free citizens to be butchered . If the fight was for the mass , there ought to be la levee en masse . If one did not compel everybody to fight , why should anybody fight ? ’ Here the applause again became vehement , and Fox again became indiscreet . I subdued Fox ’s bark into a squeak by pulling his ears . ‘ What ! ’ cries your poet - son , ‘ la levee en masse gives us fifteen millions of soldiers , with which we could crush , not Prussia alone , but the whole of Europe . ( Immense sensation . ) Let us , then , resolve that the charlatans of the Hotel de Ville are incapable of delivering us from the Prussians ; that they are deposed ; that the Ligue of the Democratie Cosmopolite is installed ; that meanwhile the Commune shall be voted the Provisional Government , and shall order the Prussians to retire within three days from the soil of Paris . ’ “
258382	258946	258947	258947	My	0	” The old Rameau sighed , hung his head , and crept away . While , amid this holiday illumination , the Parisians enjoyed the panorama before them , the Freres Chretiens and the attendants of the various ambulances were moving along the battle - plains ; the first in their large - brimmed hats and sable garbs , the last in strange motley costume , many of them in glittering uniform — all alike in their serene indifference to danger ; often pausing to pick up among the dead their own brethren who had been slaughtered in the midst of their task . Now and then they came on sinister forms apparently engaged in the same duty of tending the wounded and dead , but in truth murderous plunderers , to whom the dead and the dying were equal harvests . Did the wounded man attempt to resist the foul hands searching for their spoil , they added another wound more immediately mortal , grinning as they completed on the dead the robbery they had commenced on the dying . Raoul de Vandemar had been all the earlier part of the day with the assistants of the ambulance over which he presided , attached to the battalions of the National Guard in a quarter remote from that in which his brother had fought and fallen . When those troops , later in the day , were driven from the Montmedy plateau , which they had at first carried , Raoul repassed towards the plateau at Villiers , on which the dead lay thickest . On the way he heard a vague report of the panic which had dispersed the Mobiles of whom Enguerrand was in command , and of Enguerrand ’s vain attempt to inspirit them . But his fate was not known . There , at midnight , Raoul is still searching among the ghastly heaps and pools of blood , lighted from afar by the blaze from the observatory of Montmartre , and more near at hand by the bivouac fires extended along the banks to the left of the Marne , while everywhere about the field flitted the lanterns of the Frere Chretiens . Suddenly , in the dimness of a spot cast into shadow by an incompleted earthwork , he observed a small sinister figure perched on the breast of some wounded soldier , evidently not to succour . He sprang forward and seized a hideous - looking urchin , scarcely twelve years old , who held in one hand a small crystal locket , set in filigree gold , torn from the soldier ’s breast , and lifted high in the other a long case - knife . At a glance Raoul recognised the holy relic he had given to Enguerrand , and , flinging the precocious murderer to be seized by his assistants , he cast himself beside his brother . Enguerrand still breathed , and his languid eyes brightened as he knew the dear familiar face . He tried to speak , but his voice failed , and he shook his head sadly , but still with a faint smile on his lips . They lifted him tenderly , and placed him on a litter . The movement , gentle as it was , brought back pain , and with the pain strength to mutter , “
258955	259061	258951	258951	her	7367	” As at daybreak the loungers on Montmartre and the ramparts descended into the streets — most windows in which were open , as they had been all night , with anxious female faces peering palely down - they saw the conveyances of the ambulances coming dismally along , and many an eye turned wistfully towards the litter on which lay the idol of the pleasure - loving Paris , with the dark , bareheaded figure walking beside it,—onwards , onwards , till it reached the Hotel de Vandemar , and a woman ’s cry was heard at the entrance — the mother ’s cry , “
259068	259515	258947	258947	My	0	” The last book closed with the success of the Parisian sortie on the 30th of November , to be followed by the terrible engagements no less honourable to French valour , on the 2nd of December . There was the sanguine belief that deliverance was at hand ; that Trochu would break through the circle of iron , and effect that junction with the army of Aurelles de Paladine which would compel the Germans to raise the investment;—belief rudely shaken by Ducrot ’s proclamation of the 4th , to explain the recrossing of the Marne , and the abandonment of the positions conquered , but not altogether dispelled till von Moltke ’s letter to Trochu on the 5th announcing the defeat of the army of the Loire and the recapture of Orleans . Even then the Parisians did not lose hope of succour ; and even after the desperate and fruitless sortie against Le Bourget on the 21st , it was not without witticisms on defeat and predictions of triumph , that Winter and Famine settled sullenly on the city . Our narrative reopens with the last period of the siege . It was during these dreadful days , that if the vilest and the most hideous aspects of the Parisian population showed themselves at the worst , so all its loveliest , its noblest , its holiest characteristics — unnoticed by ordinary observers in the prosperous days of the capital — became conspicuously prominent . The higher classes , including the remnant of the old noblesse , had , during the whole siege , exhibited qualities in notable contrast to those assigned them by the enemies of aristocracy . Their sons had been foremost among those soldiers who never calumniated a leader , never fled before a foe ; their women had been among the most zealous and the most tender nurses of the ambulances they had founded and served ; their houses had been freely opened , whether to the families exiled from the suburbs , or in supplement to the hospitals . The amount of relief they afforded unostentatiously , out of means that shared the general failure of accustomed resource , when the famine commenced , would be scarcely credible if stated . Admirable , too , were the fortitude and resignation of the genuine Parisian bourgeoisie,—the thrifty tradesfolk and small rentiers,—that class in which , to judge of its timidity when opposed to a mob , courage is not the most conspicuous virtue . Courage became so now — courage to bear hourly increasing privation , and to suppress every murmur of suffering that would discredit their patriotism , and invoke “
259521	259752	258951	258951	her	7367	” It was on this class that the calamities of the siege now pressed the most heavily . The stagnation of trade , and the stoppage of the rents , in which they had invested their savings , reduced many of them to actual want . Those only of their number who obtained the pay of one - and - a - half franc a day as National Guards , could be sure to escape from starvation . But this pay had already begun to demoralise the receivers . Scanty for supply of food , it was ample for supply of drink . And drunkenness , hitherto rare in that rank of the Parisians , became a prevalent vice , aggravated in the case of a National Guard , when it wholly unfitted him for the duties he undertook , especially such National Guards as were raised from the most turbulent democracy of the working class . But of all that population ; there were two sections in which the most beautiful elements of our human nature were most touchingly manifest — the women and the priesthood , including in the latter denomination all the various brotherhoods and societies which religion formed and inspired . It was on the 27th of December that Frederic Lemercier stood gazing wistfully on a military report affixed to a blank wall , which stated that “
259767	260288	258951	258951	her	7367	” had commenced the bombardment . Poor Frederic was sadly altered ; he had escaped the Prussian ’s guns , but not the Parisian winter — the severest known for twenty years . He was one of the many frozen at their posts — brought back to the ambulance with Fox in his bosom trying to keep him warm . He had only lately been sent forth as convalescent,—ambulances were too crowded to retain a patient longer than absolutely needful,—and had been hunger - pinched and frost - pinched ever since . The luxurious Frederic had still , somewhere or other , a capital yielding above three thousand a year , and of which he could not now realise a franc , the title - deeds to various investments being in the hands of Duplessis , the most trustworthy of friends , the most upright of men , but who was in Bretagne , and could not be got at . And the time had come at Paris when you could not get trust for a pound of horse - flesh , or a daily supply of fuel . And Frederic Lemercier , who had long since spent the 2000 francs borrowed from Alain ( not ignobly , but somewhat ostentatiously , in feasting any acquaintance who wanted a feast ) , and who had sold to any one who could afford to speculate on such dainty luxuries,—clocks , bronzes , amber - mounted pipes,—all that had made the envied garniture of his bachelor ’s apartment — Frederic Lemercier was , so far as the task of keeping body and soul together , worse off than any English pauper who can apply to the Union . Of course he might have claimed his half - pay of thirty sous as a National Guard . But he little knows the true Parisian who imagines a seigneur of the Chaussee d’Antin , the oracle of those with whom he lived , and one who knew life so well that he had preached prudence to a seigneur of the Faubourg like Alain de Rochebriant , stooping to apply for the wages of thirty sons . Rations were only obtained by the wonderful patience of women , who had children to whom they were both saints and martyrs . The hours , the weary hours , one had to wait before one could get one ’s place on the line for the distribution of that atrocious black bread , defeated men,—defeated most wives if only for husbands , were defied only by mothers and daughters . Literally speaking , Lemercier was starving . Alain had been badly wounded in the sortie of the 21st , and was laid up in an ambulance . Even if he could have been got at , he had probably nothing left to bestow upon Lemercier . Lemercier gazed on the announcement of the bombardment , and the Parisian gaiety , which some French historian of the siege calls douce philosophie , lingering on him still , he said , audibly , turning round to any stranger who heard : “
260405	260486	260389	260389	I	0	” Some of the men grouped round Frederic ducked their heads in terror ; others , who knew that the thunderbolt launched from the plateau of Avron would not fall on the pavements of Paris , laughed and joked . But in front , with no sign of terror , no sound of laughter , stretched , moving inch by inch , the female procession towards the bakery in which the morsel of bread for their infants was doled out . “
260492	260500	260389	260389	I	0	” said a deep voice beside Lemercier . “
260516	260577	260389	260389	I	0	” Lemercier , offended by that rebuke , though too susceptible to good emotions not to recognise its justice , tried with feeble fingers to turn up his moustache , and to turn a defiant crest upon the rebuker . He was rather startled to see the tall martial form at his side , and to recognise Victor de Mauleon . “
260586	260594	260580	260580	you	1837	” resumed the Vicomte , half sadly , “
260617	260618	260610	260615	the soldiers whose uniform we wear	7383	” “
260668	260669	260660	260664	a future Marshal of France	7386	” “

260798	260843	260786	260796	the man most hated by the rabble who supplied those recruits	7396	” The men , while thus conversing , had moved slowly on , and were now in front of a large cafe , from the interior of which came the sound of loud bravos and clappings of hands . Lemercier ’s curiosity was excited . “
260851	260855	260786	260796	the man most hated by the rabble who supplied those recruits	7396	” he said ; “
260863	260895	260786	260796	the man most hated by the rabble who supplied those recruits	7396	” The room was thronged . In the distance , on a small raised platform , stood a girl dressed in faded theatrical finery , making her obeisance to the crowd . “
260898	260900	260901	260901	I	0	” exclaimed Frederic—“can
260920	260942	260909	260912	the once superb Julie	7399	” One of the loungers , evidently belonging to the same world as Lemercier , overheard the question and answered politely : “
260996	261040	260986	260989	Gustave Rameau,—her old lover	7402	” Meanwhile De Mauleon , who at first had glanced over the scene with his usual air of calm and cold indifference , became suddenly struck by the girl ’s beautiful face , and gazed on it with a look of startled surprise . “
261056	261057	261045	261045	you	1758	” “
261109	261110	261095	261107	la belle Leonie — whom you must have seen in your young days	7408	” “
261163	261164	261158	261158	she	7399	” “
261167	261171	261158	261158	she	7399	” said Frederic , “

261240	261241	261235	261235	she	1012	” “
261245	261251	261235	261235	she	1012	” said Victor , compassionately . “
261286	261304	261279	261279	she	1012	” Lemercier attempted a languid air of modest self - complacency as the girl now approached him . “
261326	261327	261321	261321	You	0	” “
261382	261390	261369	261369	I	0	” The girl blushed as she replied , “

261417	261430	261415	261415	Glass	1015	” The girl clutched his arm , and said in suppressed tones , “

261452	261453	261446	261446	you	0	” “
261591	261620	261621	261621	You	0	” Lemercier at that offer was nearly moved to tears . Famished though he was , he could not , however , have touched that girl ’s earnings . “
261653	261654	261649	261651	a — rentier	7421	” “
261668	261669	261661	261661	Gustave	551	” “

261729	261739	261718	261718	she	9984	” said Victor , as they regained the street . “
261791	261848	261849	261849	I	0	” De Mauleon walked towards the woman he spoke of — one of the long procession to the bakery — a child clinging to her robe . A pale grief - worn woman , still young , but with the weariness of age on her face , and the shadow of death on her child ’s . “
261856	261891	261853	261854	Madame Monnier	1017	” said De Mauleon , softly . She turned and looked at him drearily . A year ago , she would have blushed if addressed by a stranger in a name not lawfully hers . “
261894	261905	261853	261854	Madame Monnier	1017	” she said , in hollow accents broken by cough ; “
261914	261915	261916	261917	Poor woman	7429	” “
261919	261946	261916	261917	Poor woman	7429	” he resumed , walking beside her as she moved slowly on , while the eyes of other women in the procession stared at him hungrily . “
261959	261960	261961	261963	My only one	5591	” “
261996	262066	261984	261984	God	878	” De Mauleon recalled the scene of a neat comfortable apartment , and the healthful happy children at play on the floor . The mortality among the little ones , especially in the quartier occupied by the working classes , had of late been terrible . The want of food , of fuel , the intense severity of the weather , had swept them off as by a pestilence . “
262087	262120	262121	262121	He	7430	” The woman made no answer , but hung down her head . She was stifling a sob . Till then her eyes seemed to have exhausted the last source of tears . “
262125	262131	262121	262121	He	7430	” continued Victor , pityingly : “
262137	262138	262121	262121	He	7430	” “

262223	262233	262215	262215	Madame	1017	” and he thrust his purse into her hand . “
262261	262274	262259	262259	yourself	7436	” He was turning away when the woman caught hold of him . “
262346	262347	262348	262348	You	0	” “
262367	262368	262371	262378	no,—the cruel man who talked him into it	7444	” “
262397	262405	262409	262410	that man	9162	” again her voice died in sobs . “
262412	262419	262409	262410	that man	9162	” asked De Mauleon , falteringly . “
262440	262441	262432	262432	I	0	” “
262477	262478	262483	262484	the coward	7450	” “
262611	262616	262607	262607	Armand	650	” De Mauleon shuddered . “
262644	262972	262622	262642	a customer whose rooms he decorated in his spare hours on his own account before the strike,—Monsieur — — — —	7452	” here he uttered indistinctly some unpronounceable name and hurried off , soon lost as the streets grew darker . Amid groups of a higher order of men - military men , nobles , ci - devant deputies — among such ones his name stood very high . Not only his bravery in the recent sorties had been signal , but a strong belief in his military talents had become prevalent ; and conjoined with the name he had before established as a political writer , and the remembrance of the vigour and sagacity with which he had opposed the war , he seemed certain , when peace and order became established , of a brilliant position and career in a future administration : not less because he had steadfastly kept aloof from the existing Government , which it was rumoured , rightly or erroneously , that he had been solicited to join ; and from every combination of the various democratic or discontented factions . Quitting these more distinguished associates , he took his way alone towards the ramparts . The day was closing ; the thunders of the cannon were dying down . He passed by a wine - shop round which were gathered many of the worse specimens of the Moblots and National Guards , mostly drunk , and loudly talking in vehement abuse of generals and officers and commissariat . By one of the men , as he came under the glare of a petroleum lamp ( there was gas no longer in the dismal city ) , he was recognised as the commander who had dared to insist on discipline , and disgrace honest patriots who claimed to themselves the sole option between fight and flight . The man was one of those patriots — one of the new recruits whom Victor had shamed and dismissed for mutiny and cowardice . He made a drunken plunge at his former chief , shouting , “
263002	263003	263004	263006	A la lanterne	7456	” “
263008	263122	263125	263126	De Mauleon?—let	1018	” stammered and hiccupped others of the group ; but they did not stir to execute their threat . Dimly seen as the stern face and sinewy form of the threatened man was by their drowsied eyes , the name of De Mauleon , the man without fear of a foe , and without ruth for a mutineer , sufficed to protect him from outrage ; and with a slight movement of his arm that sent his denouncer reeling against the lamp - post , De Mauleon passed on:—when another man , in the uniform of a National Guard , bounded from the door of the tavern , crying with a loud voice , “
263132	263192	263127	263127	me	0	” and Victor , who had strode on with slow lion - like steps , cleaving the crowd , turned , and saw before him in the gleaming light a face , in which the bold frank , intelligent aspect of former days was lost in a wild , reckless , savage expression — the face of Armand Monnier . “
263202	263237	263196	263196	you	7457	” asked Monnier , not fiercely , but under his breath,—in that sort of stage whisper which is the natural utterance of excited men under the mingled influence of potent drink and hoarded rage . “
263246	263247	263242	263244	Victor de Mauleon	578	” “
263271	263272	263273	263273	I	0	” “
263276	263277	263273	263273	I	0	” “

263417	263418	263412	263412	you	7457	” “
263459	263460	263451	263451	you	650	” “
263503	263504	263505	263505	I	0	” “
263527	263553	263554	263554	I	0	” Here Victor ’s lip quivered , for Monnier griped him by the arm , and looked him in the face with wild stony eyes . “
263583	263627	263628	263628	Mons	1020	” Here he passed his left hand rapidly over his forehead . The fumes of wine still clouded his mind , but rays of intelligence broke through the cloud . Suddenly he said in a loud , and calm , and natural voice : “
263648	263649	263643	263643	you	1020	” “
263763	263764	263752	263752	you	1020	” “
263785	264041	263767	263767	your	1020	” But while Monnier thus spoke , De Mauleon had hastened on . Monnier looked round , saw him gone , but did not pursue . He was just intoxicated enough to know that his footsteps were not steady , and he turned back to the wine - shop and asked surlily for more wine . Could you have seen him then as he leant swinging himself to and fro against the wall,—had you known the man two years ago , you would have been a brute if you felt disgust . You could only have felt that profound compassion with which we gaze on a great royalty fallen . For the grandest of all royalties is that which takes its crown from Nature , needing no accident of birth . And Nature made the mind of Armand Monnier king - like ; endowed it with lofty scorn of meanness and falsehood and dishonour , with warmth and tenderness of heart which had glow enough to spare from ties of kindred and hearth and home , to extend to those distant circles of humanity over which royal natures would fain extend the shadow of their sceptre . How had the royalty of the man ’s nature fallen thus ? Royalty rarely falls from its own constitutional faults . It falls when , ceasing to be royal , it becomes subservient to bad advisers . And what bad advisers , always appealing to his better qualities and so enlisting his worser , had discrowned this mechanic ? “
264050	264058	263767	263767	your	1020	” says the old - fashioned poet . “
264062	264068	263767	263767	your	1020	” says the modern philosopher ; “
264079	264676	263767	263767	your	1020	” Possibly , as all individuals and all communities must go through the stage of a little knowledge before they can arrive at that of much knowledge , the philosopher ’s assertion may be right in the long - run , and applied to humankind in general . But there is a period , as there is a class , in which a little knowledge tends to terrible demoralisation . And Armand Monnier lived in that period and was one of that class . The little knowledge that his mind , impulsive and ardent , had picked up out of books that warred with the great foundations of existing society , had originated in ill advices . A man stored with much knowledge would never have let Madame de Grantmesnil ’s denunciations of marriage rites , or Louis Blane ’s vindication of Robespierre as the representative of the working against the middle class , influence his practical life . He would have assessed such opinions at their real worth ; and whatever that worth might seem to him , would not to such opinions have committed the conduct of his life . Opinion is not fateful : conduct is . A little knowledge crazes an earnest , warm - blooded , powerful creature like Armand Monnier into a fanatic . He takes an opinion which pleases him as a revelation from the gods ; that opinion shapes his conduct ; that conduct is his fate . Woe to the philosopher who serenely flings before the little knowledge of the artisan dogmas as harmless as the Atlantis of Plato if only to be discussed by philosophers , and deadly as the torches of Ate if seized as articles of a creed by fanatics ! But thrice woe to the artisan who makes himself the zealot of the Dogma ! Poor Armand acts on the opinions he adopts ; proves his contempt for the marriage state by living with the wife of another ; resents , as natures so inherently manly must do , the Society that visits on her his defiance of its laws ; throws himself , head foremost , against that society altogether ; necessarily joins all who have other reasons for hostility to Society ; he himself having every inducement not to join indiscriminate strikes — high wages , a liberal employer , ample savings , the certainty of soon becoming employer himself . No ; that is not enough to the fanatic : he persists on being dupe and victim . He , this great king of labour , crowned by Nature , and cursed with that degree of little knowledge which does not comprehend how much more is required before a schoolboy would admit it to be knowledge at all,—he rushes into the maddest of all speculations — that of the artisan with little knowledge and enormous faith — that which intrusts the safety and repose and dignity of life to some ambitious adventurer , who uses his warm heart for the adventurer ’s frigid purpose , much as the lawyer - government of September used the Communists,—much as , in every revolution of France , a Bertrand has used a Raton — much as , till the sound of the last trumpet , men very much worse than Victor de Mauleon will use men very much better than Armand Monnier , if the Armand Monniers disdain the modesty of an Isaac Newton on hearing that a theorem to which he had given all the strength of his patient intellect was disputed : “
264682	264857	263767	263767	your	1020	” meaning , I suppose , that it requires a large amount of experience ascertained before a man of much knowledge becomes that which a man of little knowledge is at a jump - the fanatic of an experiment untried . Scarcely had De Mauleon quitted Lemercier before the latter was joined by two loungers scarcely less famished than himself — Savarin and De Breze . Like himself , too , both had been sufferers from illness , though not of a nature to be consigned to an hospital . All manner of diseases then had combined to form the pestilence which filled the streets with unregarded hearses — bronchitis , pneumonia , smallpox , a strange sort of spurious dysentery much more speedily fatal than the genuine . The three men , a year before so sleek , looked like ghosts under the withering sky ; yet all three retained embers of the native Parisian humour , which their very breath on meeting sufficed to kindle up into jubilant sparks or rapid flashes . “
264863	264876	263767	263767	your	1020	” said Savarin , as the friends strolled or rather crawled towards the Boulevards—“two
264903	264904	263767	263767	your	1020	” “
264907	264916	263767	263767	your	1020	” gasped De Breze , with watering mouth ; “

264983	264984	264977	264977	she	11706	” “
264988	264993	264977	264977	she	11706	” feebly exclaimed Lemercier . “
265005	265006	264977	264977	she	11706	” “
265109	265117	265099	265100	De Breze	514	” De Breze shook his head expressively . “
265120	265124	265099	265100	De Breze	514	” resumed Savarin , “
265173	265174	265201	265201	they	7501	” “
265183	265187	265201	265201	they	7501	” said Lemercier . “
265279	265280	265269	265269	They	7501	” “
265437	265438	265439	265439	I	0	” “
265446	265450	265439	265439	I	0	” said Lemercier , “
265468	265533	265534	265534	Friends	1591	” He reeled as he spoke , and clung to De Breze for support . De Breze had the reputation of being the most selfish of men . But at that moment , when a generous man might be excused for being selfish enough to desire to keep the little that he had for his own reprieve from starvation , this egotist became superb . “
265536	265543	265534	265534	Friends	1591	” he cried , with enthusiasm , “
265561	265562	265534	265534	Friends	1591	” “
265565	265569	265534	265534	Friends	1591	” faltered Lemercier . “
265605	265606	265607	265607	Fox	555	” “
265615	265622	265628	265628	he	555	” cried De Breze , startled . “
265650	265651	265642	265642	he	555	” “
265660	265664	265655	265655	you	0	” asked Savarin . “

265819	265834	265803	265803	you	7517	” said De Breze , catching Frederic ’s arm as he turned to depart . “
265880	265881	265870	265870	Fox	555	” “
265884	265891	265870	265870	Fox	555	” said Savarin , detaining them . “
265923	265969	265921	265921	Polichinello	1033	” He pointed to the puppet - show , round which a crowd , not of children alone , but of men - middle - aged and old - were collected ; while sous were dropped into the tin handed round by a squalid boy . “
265975	265990	265921	265921	Polichinello	1033	” whispered De Breze to Lemercier , with the voice of a tempting fiend , “
265999	266023	265993	265993	Punch	980	” It was true . The dog was gone,—its place supplied by a melancholy emaciated cat . Frederic crawled towards the squalid boy . “
266032	266033	266034	266034	We	7522	” “
266051	266064	266042	266042	we	7522	” said the urchin , with a sensual smack of the lips . “
266070	266282	266068	266068	Fox	555	” murmured Frederic , as the three men went slowly down through the darkening streets — the roar of the Prussian guns heard afar , while distinct and near rang the laugh of the idlers round the Punch without a dog . While De Breze and his friends were feasting at the cafe Anglais , and faring better than the host had promised — for the bill of fare comprised such luxuries as ass , mule , peas , fried potatoes , and champagne ( champagne in some mysterious way was inexhaustible during the time of famine)—a very different group had assembled in the rooms of Isaura Cicogna . She and the Venosta had hitherto escaped the extreme destitution to which many richer persons had been reduced . It is true that Isaura ’s fortune placed in the hands of the absent Louvier , and invested in the new street that was to have been , brought no return . It was true that in that street the Venosta , dreaming of cent . per cent . , had invested all her savings . But the Venosta , at the first announcement of war , had insisted on retaining in hand a small sum from the amount Isaura had received from her “
266285	267161	266068	266068	Fox	555	” that might suffice for current expenses , and with yet more acute foresight had laid in stores of provisions and fuel immediately after the probability of a siege became apparent . But even the provident mind of the Venosta had never foreseen that the siege would endure so long , or that the prices of all articles of necessity would rise so high . And meanwhile all resources — money , fuel , provisions — had been largely drawn upon by the charity and benevolence of Isaura , without much remonstrance on the part of the Venosta , whose nature was very accessible to pity . Unfortunately , too , of late money and provisions had failed to Monsieur and Madame Rameau , their income consisting partly of rents no longer paid , and the profits of a sleeping partnership in the old shop , from which custom had departed ; so that they came to share the fireside and meals at the rooms of their son ’s fiancee with little scruple , because utterly unaware that the money retained and the provisions stored by the Venosta were now nearly exhausted . The patriotic ardour which had first induced the elder Rameau to volunteer his services as a National Guard had been ere this cooled if not suppressed , first by the hardships of the duty , and then by the disorderly conduct of his associates , and their ribald talk and obscene songs . He was much beyond the age at which he could be registered . His son was , however , compelled to become his substitute , though from his sickly health and delicate frame attached to that portion of the National Guard which took no part in actual engagements , and was supposed to do work on the ramparts and maintain order in the city . In that duty , so opposed to his tastes and habits , Gustave signalised himself as one of the loudest declaimers against the imbecility of the Government , and in the demand for immediate and energetic action , no matter at what loss of life , on the part of all — except the heroic force to which he himself was attached . Still , despite his military labours , Gustave found leisure to contribute to Red journals , and his contributions paid him tolerably well . To do him justice , his parents concealed from him the extent of their destitution ; they , on their part , not aware that he was so able to assist them , rather fearing that he himself had nothing else for support but his scanty pay as a National Guard . In fact , of late the parents and son had seen little of each other . M. Rameau , though a Liberal politician , was Liberal as a tradesman , not as a Red Republican or a Socialist . And , though little heeding his son ’s theories while the Empire secured him from the practical effect of them , he was now as sincerely frightened at the chance of the Communists becoming rampant as most of the Parisian tradesmen were . Madame Rameau , on her side , though she had the dislike to aristocrats which was prevalent with her class , was a stanch Roman Catholic ; and seeing in the disasters that had befallen her country the punishment justly incurred by its sins , could not but be shocked by the opinions of Gustave , though she little knew that he was the author of certain articles in certain journals , in which these opinions were proclaimed with a vehemence far exceeding that which they assumed in his conversation . She had spoken to him with warm anger , mixed with passionate tears , on his irreligious principles ; and from that moment Gustave shunned to give her another opportunity of insulting his pride and depreciating his wisdom . Partly to avoid meeting his parents , partly because he recoiled almost as much from the ennui of meeting the other visitors at her apartments — the Paris ladies associated with her in the ambulance , Raoul de Vandeniar , whom he especially hated , and the Abbe Vertpre , who had recently come into intimate friendship with both the Italian ladies — his visits to Isaura had become exceedingly rare . He made his incessant military duties the pretext for absenting himself ; and now , on this evening , there were gathered round Isaura ’s hearth — on which burned almost the last of the hoarded fuel — the Venosta , the two Rameaus , the Abbe Vertpre , who was attached as confessor to the society of which Isaura was so zealous a member . The old priest and the young poetess had become dear friends . There is in the nature of a woman ( and especially of a woman at once so gifted and so childlike as Isaura , combining an innate tendency towards faith with a restless inquisitiveness of intellect , which is always suggesting query or doubt ) a craving for something afar from the sphere of her sorrow , which can only be obtained through that “
267168	267204	266068	266068	Fox	555	” which we call religion . And hence , to natures like Isaura ’s , that link between the woman and the priest , which the philosophy of France has never been able to dissever . “
267210	267215	267216	267216	I	0	” said Madame Rameau ; “
267231	267232	267225	267225	Isaura	454	” “
267240	267245	267225	267225	Isaura	454	” said the Abby . “
267308	267309	267295	267296	His kinsman	9168	” “
267317	267322	267314	267314	I	0	” said the Venosta ; “
267345	267346	267334	267343	the ugly warrior whom a scar on the face improves	7536	” “
267393	267394	267378	267378	Raoul	1035	” “
267413	267418	267395	267397	M. de Vandemar	564	” said Madame Rameau . “
267428	267436	267395	267397	M. de Vandemar	564	” The Abbe ’s mild brow contracted . “
267589	267591	267593	267593	me	0	” ’ “
267597	267655	267593	267593	me	0	” murmured Madame Rameau humbly , while the Venosta burst into tears . The Abbe , though a most sincere and earnest ecclesiastic , was a cheery and genial man of the world ; and , in order to relieve Madame Rameau from the painful self - reproach he had before excited , he turned the conversation . “
267662	267671	267593	267593	me	0	” he said , with his pleasant laugh , “
267777	267904	267915	267916	the author	8831	” And here , with a dry humour that turned into ridicule what would otherwise have excited disgust and indignation among his listeners , he read aloud passages replete with the sort of false eloquence which was then the vogue among the Red journals . In these passages , not only the Abbe was pointed out for popular execration , but Raoul de Vandemar , though not expressly named , was clearly indicated as a pupil of the Abbe ’s , the type of a lay Jesuit . The Venosta alone did not share in the contemptuous laughter with which the inflated style of these diatribes inspired the Rameaus . Her simple Italian mind was horror - stricken by language which the Abbe treated with ridicule . “
267907	267912	267915	267916	the author	8831	” said M. Rameau , “
267923	267924	267915	267916	the author	8831	” “
267927	267932	267936	267936	himself	2986	” answered the Abbe ; “
267950	268231	267936	267936	himself	2986	” Here the door opened , and Raoul entered , accompanying Isaura . A change had come over the face of the young Vandemar since his brother ’s death . The lines about the mouth had deepened , the cheeks had lost their rounded contour and grown somewhat hollow . But the expression was as serene as ever , perhaps even less pensively melancholy . His whole aspect was that of a man who has sorrowed , but been supported in sorrow ; perhaps it was more sweet - certainly it was more lofty . And , as if there were in the atmosphere of his presence something that communicated the likeness of his own soul to others , since Isaura had been brought into his companionship , her own lovely face had caught the expression that prevailed in his — that , too , had become more sweet — that , too , had become more lofty . The friendship that had grown up between these two young mourners was of a very rare nature . It had in it no sentiment that could ever warm into the passion of human love . Indeed , had Isaura ’s heart been free to give away , love for Raoul de Vandemar would have seemed to her a profanation . He was never more priestly than when he was most tender . And the tenderness of Raoul towards her was that of some saint - like nature towards the acolyte whom it attracted upwards . He had once , just before Enguerrand ’s death , spoken to Isaura with a touching candour as to his own predilection for a monastic life . “
268572	268617	268618	268618	She	7575	” But after Enguerrand ’s death , Raoul resigned all idea of the convent . That evening , as he attended to their homes Isaura and the other ladies at to the ambulance , he said , in answer to inquiries about his mother , “
268649	268669	268670	268670	I	0	” Raoul did not remain many minutes at Isaura ’s . The Abbe accompanied him on his way home . “
268679	268684	268694	268697	the Vicomte de Mauleon	522	” said the former ; “
268699	268700	268694	268697	the Vicomte de Mauleon	522	” “

269159	269245	269137	269137	I	0	” M. Mauleon was somewhat surprised by Raoul ’s visit the next morning . He had no great liking for a kinsman whose politely distant reserve towards him , in contrast to poor Euguerrand ’s genial heartiness , had much wounded his sensitive self - respect ; nor could he comprehend the religious scruples which forbade Raoul to take a soldier ’s share in the battle - field , though in seeking there to save the lives of others so fearlessly hazarding his own life . “
269248	269258	269137	269137	I	0	” said Raoul , with his sweet mournful smile , “
269303	269331	269332	269333	Louise Duval	385	” He proceeded at once to repeat what the Abbe had communicated to him the night before relative to the illness and the request of the nun . “
269335	269340	269332	269333	Louise Duval	385	” exclaimed the Vicomte , “

269453	269457	269441	269441	I	0	” said Raoul ; “
269485	269535	269536	269536	I	0	” Victor was touched by this conciliatory speech , and in a few minutes more the two men were on their way to the convent on the other side of the Seine . Victor commenced the conversation by a warm and heartfelt tribute to Euguerrand ’s character and memory . “
269539	269543	269536	269536	I	0	” he said , “
269637	269975	269977	269978	de Mauleon	597	” Raoul made no answer , but pressed gratefully the arm now linked within his own . The companions walked on in silence ; Victor ’s mind settling on the visit he was about to make to the niece so long mysteriously lost , and now so unexpectedly found . Louise had inspired him with a certain interest from her beauty and force of character , but never with any warm affection . He felt relieved to find that her life had found its close in the sanctuary of the convent . He had never divested himself of a certain fear , inspired by Louvier ’s statement that she might live to bring scandal and disgrace on the name he had with so much difficulty , and after so lengthened an anguish , partially cleared in his own person . Raoul left De Mauleon at the gate of the convent , and took his way towards the hospitals where he visited , and the poor whom he relieved . Victor was conducted silently into the convent parloir ; and , after waiting there several minutes , the door opened , and the Superieure entered . As she advanced towards him , with stately step and solemn visage , De Mauleon recoiled , and uttered a half - suppressed exclamation that partook both of amaze and awe . Could it be possible ? Was this majestic woman , with the grave impassible aspect , once the ardent girl whose tender letters he had cherished through stormy years , and only burned on the night before the most perilous of his battle - fields ? This the one , the sole one , whom in his younger dreams he had seen as his destined wife ? It was so — it was . Doubt vanished when he heard her voice ; and yet how different every tone , every accent , from those of the low , soft , thrilling music that had breathed in the voice of old ! “
269980	269987	269977	269978	de Mauleon	597	” said the Superieure , calmly , “
270121	270135	270117	270117	she	1037	” The Superieure here crossed herself , and murmured pious words in Latin . “
270142	270175	270176	270176	I	0	” said Victor , feelingly , roused from his stun at the first sight of the Superieure by her measured tones , and the melancholy information she so composedly conveyed to him . “
270202	270203	270185	270185	she	1037	” “
270417	270418	270412	270412	I	0	” “
270425	270426	270427	270427	She	1037	” “
270588	270695	270696	270699	M. Victor de Mauleon	578	” De Mauleon took a packet , unsealed , from the thin white fingers of the Superieure ; and as he bent to receive it , lifted towards her eyes eloquent with sorrowful , humble pathos , in which it was impossible for the heart of a woman who had loved not to see a reference to the past which the lips did not dare to utter . A faint , scarce - perceptible blush stole over the marble cheek of the nun . But , with an exquisite delicacy , in which survived the woman while reigned the nun , she replied to the appeal . “
270768	270769	270772	270772	you	7620	” “
270783	270784	270785	270785	I	0	” “
270798	270804	270785	270785	I	0	” The Superieure hurried on . “
270854	270897	270850	270852	Victor de Mauleon	578	” She retreated to the door , and then turned towards him with a look in which all the marble had melted away , adding , with words more formally nunlike , yet unmistakably womanlike , than those which had gone before , “
270917	271628	270850	270852	Victor de Mauleon	578	” She spoke , and vanished . In a kind of dim and dreamlike bewilderment , Victor de Mauleon found himself without the walls of the convent . Mechanically , as a man does when the routine of his life is presented to him , from the first Minister of State to the poor clown at a suburban theatre , doomed to appear at their posts , to prose on a Beer Bill , or grin through a horse - collar , though their hearts are bleeding at every pore with some household or secret affliction,—mechanically De Mauldon went his way towards the ramparts , at a section of which he daily drilled his raw recruits . Proverbial for his severity towards those who offended , for the cordiality of his praise of those who pleased his soldierly judgment , no change of his demeanour was visible that morning , save that he might be somewhat milder to the one , somewhat less hearty to the other . This routine duty done , he passed slowly towards a more deserted because a more exposed part of the defences , and seated himself on the frozen sward alone . The cannon thundered around him . He heard unconsciously : from time to time an obus hissed and splintered close at his feet;—he saw with abstracted eye . His soul was with the past ; and , brooding over all that in the past lay buried there , came over him a conviction of the vanity of the human earth - bounded objects for which we burn or freeze , far more absolute than had grown out of the worldly cynicism connected with his worldly ambition . The sight of that face , associated with the one pure romance of his reckless youth , the face of one so estranged , so serenely aloft from all memories of youth , of romance , of passion , smote him in the midst of the new hopes of the new career , as the look on the skull of the woman he had so loved and so mourned , when disburied from her grave , smote the brilliant noble who became the stern reformer of La Trappe . And while thus gloomily meditating , the letter of the poor Louise Duval was forgotten . She whose existence had so troubled , and crossed , and partly marred the lives of others,—she , scarcely dead , and already forgotten by her nearest kin . Well — had she not forgotten , put wholly out of her mind , all that was due to those much nearer to her than is an uncle to a niece ? The short , bitter , sunless day was advancing towards its decline before Victor roused himself with a quick impatient start from his reverie , and took forth the letter from the dead nun . It began with expressions of gratitude , of joy at the thought that she should see him again before she died , thank him for his past kindness , and receive , she trusted , his assurance that he would attend to her last remorseful injunctions . I pass over much that followed in the explanation of events in her life sufficiently known to the reader . She stated , as the strongest reason why she had refused the hand of Louvier , her knowledge that she should in due time become a mother — a fact concealed from Victor , secure that he would then urge her not to annul her informal marriage , but rather insist on the ceremonies that would render it valid . She touched briefly on her confidential intimacy with Madame Marigny , the exchange of name and papers , her confinement in the neighbourhood of Aix , the child left to the care of the nurse , the journey to Munich to find the false Louise Duval was no more . The documents obtained through the agency of her easy - tempered kinsman , the late Marquis de Rochebriant , and her subsequent domestication in the house of the von Rudesheims,—all this it is needless to do more here than briefly recapitulate . The letter then went on : “
272080	272373	272374	272374	My	0	“ I then repaired to Aix . I saw the child . Alas ! unnatural mother that I was , the sight only more vividly brought before me the sense of my own perilous position . Yet the child was lovely ! a likeness of myself , but lovelier far , for it was a pure , innocent , gentle loveliness . And they told her to call me ‘ Maman . ’ Oh , did I not relent when I heard that name ? No ; it jarred on my ear as a word of reproach and shame . In walking with the infant towards the railway station , imagine my dismay when suddenly I met the man who had been taught to believe me dead . I soon discovered that his dismay was equal to my own,—that I had nothing to fear from his desire to claim me . It did occur to me for a moment to resign his child to him . But when he shrank reluctantly from a half suggestion to that effect , my pride was wounded , my conscience absolved . And , after all , it might be unsafe to my future to leave with him any motive for tracing me . I left him hastily . I have never seen nor heard of him more . I took the child to Coblentz . Madame Surville was charmed with its prettiness and prattle,—charmed still more when I rebuked the poor infant for calling me ‘ Maman , ’ and said , ‘ Thy real mother is here . ’ Freed from my trouble , I returned to the kind German roof I had quitted , and shortly after became the wife of Ludovico Cicogna . “
272560	272795	272811	272813	the good priest	7678	“ At this time , an Englishman , with whom Ludovico had made acquaintance in Venice , and who visited often at our house in Verona , offered me his hand . He had taken an extraordinary liking to Isaura , Cicogna ’s daughter by his first marriage . But I think his proposal was dictated partly by compassion for me , and more by affection for her . For the sake of my boy Luigi I married him . He was a good man , of retired learned habits with which I had no sympathy . His companionship overwhelmed me with ennui . But I bore it patiently for Luigi ’s sake . God saw that my heart was as much as ever estranged from Him , and He took away my all on earth — my boy . Then in my desolation I turned to our Holy Church for comfort . I found a friend in the priest , my confessor . I was startled to learn from him how guilty I had been — was still . Pushing to an extreme the doctrines of the Church , he would not allow that my first marriage , though null by law , was void in the eyes of Heaven . Was not the death of the child I so cherished a penalty due to my sin towards the child I had abandoned ? “
272837	272983	272985	272985	we	7681	“ I had a painful interview with M. Selby . I announced my intention to separate from him . I alleged as a reason my conscientious repugnance to live with a professed heretic — an enemy to our Holy Church . When M. Selby found that he could not shake my resolution , he lent himself to it with the forbearance and generosity which he had always exhibited . On our marriage he had settled on me five thousand pounds , to be absolutely mine in the event of his death . He now proposed to concede to me the interest on that capital during his life , and he undertook the charge of my step - daughter Isaura , and secured to her all the rest he had to leave ; such landed property as he possessed in England passing to a distant relative . “
273140	273534	273576	273576	My	0	“ Probably I might yet by searching inquiry have found her out ; you will say it was my duty at least to institute such inquiry . No doubt ; I now remorsefully feel that it was . I did not think so at the time . The Italian priest had given me a few letters of introduction to French ladies with whom , when they had sojourned at Florence , he had made acquaintance . These ladies were very strict devotees , formal observers of those decorums by which devotion proclaims itself to the world . They had received me not only with kindness but with marked respect . They chose to exalt into the noblest self - sacrifice the act of my leaving M. Selby ’s house . Exaggerating the simple cause assigned to it in the priest ’s letter , they represented me as quitting a luxurious home and an idolising husband rather than continue intimate intercourse with the enemy of my religion . This new sort of flattery intoxicated me with its fumes . I recoiled from the thought of shattering the pedestal to which I had found myself elevated . What if I should discover my daughter in one from the touch of whose robe these holy women would recoil as from the rags of a leper ! No ; it would be impossible for me to own her — impossible for me to give her the shelter of my roof . Nay , if discovered to hold any commune with such an outcast , no explanation , no excuse short of the actual truth , would avail with these austere judges of human error . And the actual truth would be yet deeper disgrace . I reasoned away my conscience . If I looked for example in the circles in which I had obtained reverential place , I could find no instance in which a girl who had fallen from virtue was not repudiated by her nearest relatives . Nay , when I thought of my own mother , had not her father refused to see her , to acknowledge her child , from no other offence than that of a misalliance which wounded the family pride ? That pride , alas ! was in my blood — my sole inheritance from the family I sprang from . “
273717	273793	273794	273794	I	0	“ But oh , my uncle , find out — a man can do so with a facility not accorded to a woman — what has become of this poor Julie , and devote what you may deem right and just of the sum thus bequeathed to place her above want and temptation . In doing so , I know you will respect my name : I would not have it dishonour you , indeed . “
273866	273916	273851	273851	you	7691	“ Would that I were worthy to pray for others , that I might add , ‘ May the Saints have you in their keeping and lead you to faith in the Holy Church , which has power to absolve from sins those who repent as I do . ’ ”

276010	276019	276021	276022	M. Rameau	551	“ Do not degrade us , my wife , ”
276028	276150	276021	276022	M. Rameau	551	“ by a word to imply that we would stoop to sue for support to our ungrateful child . No , we will not starve ! I am strong enough still to find food for you . I will apply for restoration to the National Guard . They have augmented the pay to married men ; it is now nearly two francs and a half a - day to a pere de famille , and on that pay we all can at least live . Courage , my wife ! I will go at once for employment . Many men older than I am are at watch on the ramparts , and will march to the battle on the next sortie . ”
276151	276158	276160	276161	Madame Rameau	386	“ It shall not be so , ”
276175	276209	276210	276210	she	386	“ I loved my son better than thee once — more shame to me . Now , I would rather lose twenty such sons than peril thy life , my Jacques ! Madame , ”
276218	276402	276210	276210	she	386	“ thou wert wiser than I. Thou wert ever opposed to the union between thy young friend and my son . I felt sore with thee for it — a mother is so selfish when she puts herself in the place of her child . I thought that only through marriage with one so pure , so noble , so holy , Gustave could be saved from sin and evil . I am deceived . A man so heartless to his parents , so neglectful of his affianced , is not to be redeemed . I brought about this betrothal : tell Isaura that I release her from it . I have watched her closely since she was entrapped into it . I know how miserable the thought of it has made her , though , in her sublime devotion to her plighted word , she sought to conceal from me the real state of her heart . If the betrothal bring such sorrow , what would the union do ! Tell her this from me . Come , Jacques , come away ! ”

276425	276508	276509	276509	she	430	“ It is true that I did oppose , so far as I could , my poor Piccola ’s engagement with M. Gustave . But I dare not do your bidding . Isaura would not listen to me . And let us be just ! M. Gustave may be able satisfactorily to explain his seeming indifference and neglect . His health is always very delicate ; perhaps he may be again dangerously ill . He serves in the National Guard ; perhaps — ”
276532	276574	276524	276524	her	430	“ Perhaps dead!—and we have wronged him ! Oh , Jacques , Jacques ! how shall we find out - how discover our boy ? Who can tell us where to search ? at the hospital — or in the cemeteries ? ”
276607	276668	276594	276594	Jacques	633	“ No , m’amie , comfort thyself , if it be indeed comfort to learn that thy son is alive and well . For my part , I know not if I would not rather he had died in his innocent childhood . I have seen him — spoken to him . I know where he is to be found . ”
276669	276683	276594	276594	Jacques	633	“ You do , and concealed it from me ? Oh , Jacques ! ”
276684	276814	276594	276594	Jacques	633	“ Listen to me , wife , and you , too , Madame ; for what I have to say should be made known to Mademoiselle Cicogna . Some time since , on the night of the famous sortie , when at my post on the ramparts , I was told that Gustave had joined himself to the most violent of the Red Republicans , and had uttered at the Club de la Vengeance sentiments , of which I will only say that I , his father and a Frenchman , hung my head with shame when they were repeated to me . I resolved to go to the club myself . I did . I heard him speak — heard him denounce Christianity as the instrument of tyrants . ”
276815	276818	276820	276822	the two women	7757	“ Ah ! ”
276829	277021	276820	276822	the two women	7757	“ When the assembly broke up , I waylaid him at the door . I spoke to him seriously . I told him what anguish such announcement of blasphemous opinions would inflict on his pious mother . I told him I should deem it my duty to inform Mademoiselle Cicogna , and warn her against the union on which he had told us his heart was bent . He appeared sincerely moved by what I said ; implored me to keep silence towards his mother and his betrothed ; and promised , on that condition , to relinquish at once what he called ‘ his career as an orator , ’ and appear no more at such execrable clubs . On this understanding I held my tongue . Why , with such other causes of grief and suffering , should I tell thee , poor wife , of a sin that I hoped thy son had repented and would not repeat ? And Gustave kept his word . He has never , so far as I know , attended , at least spoken , at the Red clubs since that evening . ”
277022	277028	277030	277031	Madame Rameau	386	“ Thank heaven so far , ”
277033	277088	277030	277031	Madame Rameau	386	“ So far , yes ; but hear more . A little time after I thus met him he changed his lodging , and did not confide to us his new address , giving as a reason to us that he wished to avoid a clue to his discovery by that pertinacious Mademoiselle Julie . ”
277123	277134	277120	277120	she	8402	“ Mademoiselle Julie ! Santa Maria ! who is she ? ”
277135	277138	277140	277141	M. Rameau	551	“ Oh ! ”
277162	277307	277120	277120	she	8402	“ a trifle not worth considering . Of course , a good - looking garcon like Gustave must have his little affairs of the heart before he settles for life . Unluckily , amongst those of Gustave was one with a violent - tempered girl who persecuted him when he left her , and he naturally wished to avoid all chance of a silly scandal , if only out of respect to the dignity of his fiancee . But I found that was not the true motive , or at least the only one , for concealment . Prepare yourself , my poor wife . Thou hast heard of these terrible journals which the decheance has let loose upon us . Our unhappy boy is the principal writer of one of the worst of them , under the name of ‘ Diderot le Jeune . ”
277309	277312	277314	277315	the Venosta	430	“ What ! ”
277317	277376	277314	277315	the Venosta	430	“ That monster ! The good Abbe Vertpre was telling us of the writings with that name attached to them . The Abbe himself is denounced by name as one of those meddling priests who are to be constrained to serve as soldiers or pointed out to the vengeance of the canaille . Isaura ’s fiancee a blasphemer ! ”
277377	277382	277384	277385	Madame Rameau	386	“ Hush , hush ! ”
277396	277405	277384	277385	Madame Rameau	386	“ How do you know this , Jacques ? ”
277406	277800	277314	277315	the Venosta	430	“ From the lips of Gustave himself . I heard first of it yesterday from one of the young reprobates with whom he used to be familiar , and who even complimented me on the rising fame of my son , and praised the eloquence of his article that day . But I would not believe him . I bought the journal — here it is ; saw the name and address of the printer — went this morning to the office — was there told that ‘ Diderot le Jeune ’ was within revising the press — stationed myself by the street door , and when Gustave came out I seized his arm , and asked him to say Yes or No if he was the author of this infamous article,—this , which I now hold in my hand . He owned the authorship with pride ; talked wildly of the great man he was — of the great things he was to do ; said that , in hitherto concealing his true name , he had done all he could to defer to the bigoted prejudices of his parents and his fiancee ; and that if genius , like fire , would find its way out , he could not help it ; that a time was rapidly coming when his opinions would be uppermost ; that since October the Communists were gaining ascendancy , and only waited the end of the siege to put down the present Government , and with it all hypocrisies and shams , religious or social . My wife , he was rude to me , insulting ! but he had been drinking — that made him incautious : and he continued to walk by my side towards his own lodging , on reaching which he ironically invited me to enter , saying , ‘ I should meet there men who would soon argue me out of my obsolete notions . ’ You may go to him , wife , now , if you please . I will not , nor will I take from him a crust of bread . I came hither , determined to tell the young lady all this , if I found her at home . I should be a dishonoured man if I suffered her to be cheated into misery . “
277826	278567	277822	277822	I	0	” M. Rameau , habitually the mildest of men , had , in talking , worked himself up into positive fury . His wife , calmer but more deeply affected , made a piteous sign to the Venosta not to say more ; and without other salutation or adieu took her husband ’s arm , and led him from the house . Obtaining from her husband Gustave ’s address , Madame Rameau hastened to her son ’s apartment alone through the darkling streets . The house in which he lodged was in a different quarter from that in which Isaura had visited him . Then , the street selected was still in the centre of the beau monde — now , it was within the precincts of that section of the many - faced capital in which the beau monde was held in detestation or scorn ; still the house had certain pretensions , boasting a courtyard and a porter ’s lodge . Madame Rameau , instructed to mount au second , found the door ajar , and , entering , perceived on the table of the little salon the remains of a feast which , however untempting it might have been in happier times , contrasted strongly with the meagre fare of which Gustave ’s parents had deemed themselves fortunate to partake at the board of his betrothed ; remnants of those viands which offered to the inquisitive epicure an experiment in food much too costly for the popular stomach — dainty morsels of elephant , hippopotamus , and wolf , interspersed with half - emptied bottles of varied and high - priced wines . Passing these evidences of unseasonable extravagance with a mute sentiment of anger and disgust , Madame Rameau penetrated into a small cabinet , the door of which was also ajar , and saw her son stretched on his bed half dressed , breathing heavily in the sleep which follows intoxication . She did not attempt to disturb him . She placed herself quietly by his side , gazing mournfully on the face which she had once so proudly contemplated , now haggard and faded,—still strangely beautiful , though it was the beauty of ruin . From time to time he stirred uneasily , and muttered broken words , in which fragments of his own delicately - worded verse were incoherently mixed up with ribald slang , addressed to imaginary companions . In his dreams he was evidently living over again his late revel , with episodical diversions into the poet - world , of which he was rather a vagrant nomad than a settled cultivator . Then she would silently bathe his feverish temples with the perfumed water she found on his dressing - table . And so she watched till , in the middle of the night , he woke up , and recovered the possession of his reason with a quickness that surprised Madame Rameau . He was , indeed , one of those men in whom excess of drink , when slept off , is succeeded by extreme mildness , the effect of nervous exhaustion , and by a dejected repentance , which , to his mother , seemed a propitious lucidity of the moral sense . Certainly on seeing her he threw himself on her breast , and began to shed tears . Madame Rameau had not the heart to reproach him sternly . But by gentle degrees she made him comprehend the pain he had given to his father , and the destitution in which he had deserted his parents and his affianced . In his present mood Gustave was deeply affected by these representations . He excused himself feebly by dwelling on the excitement of the times , the preoccupation of his mind , the example of his companions ; but with his excuses he mingled passionate expressions of remorse , and before daybreak mother and son were completely reconciled . Then he fell into a tranquil sleep ; and Madame Rameau , quite worn out , slept also in the chair beside him , her arm around his neck . He awoke before she did at a late hour in the morning ; and stealing from her arm , went to his escritoire , and took forth what money he found there , half of which he poured into her lap , kissing her till she awoke . “
278570	278574	278568	278568	Mother	4657	” he said , “
278597	278598	278595	278595	Isaura	454	” “
278631	278666	278614	278614	she	454	” Gustave had already turned to his looking - glass , and was arranging with care his dark ringlets : his personal vanity — his remorse appeased by this pecuniary oblation — had revived . “
278669	278674	278675	278675	I	0	” he said gaily , “
278720	278774	278712	278712	I	0	” In the mean while , Isaura , on her return to her apartment at the wintry nightfall , found a cart stationed at the door , and the Venosta on the threshold , superintending the removal of various articles of furniture — indeed , all such articles as were not absolutely required . “
278779	278789	278712	278712	I	0	” she said , with an attempt at cheerfulness , “
278874	279051	279052	279052	My	0	” Isaura smiled faintly , kissed the Venosta ’s cheek , and ascended with weary steps to the sitting - room . There she seated herself quietly , looking with abstracted eyes round the bare dismantled space by the light of the single candle . When the Venosta re - entered , she was followed by the servants , bringing in a daintier meal than they had known for days — a genuine rabbit , potatoes , marrons glaces , a bottle of wine , and a pannier of wood . The fire was soon lighted , the Venosta plying the bellows . It was not till this banquet , of which Isaura , faint as she was , scarcely partook , had been remitted to the two Italian women - servants , and another log been thrown on the hearth , that the Venosta opened the subject which was pressing on her heart . She did this with a joyous smile , taking both Isaura ’s hands in her own , and stroking them fondly . “
279071	279365	279063	279063	Thou	8768	” and then she related all that M. Rameau had said , and finished by producing the copy of Gustave ’s unhallowed journal . When she had read the latter , which she did with compressed lips and varying colour , the girl fell on her knees — not to thank Heaven that she would now escape a union from which her soul so recoiled — not that she was indeed free , but to pray , with tears rolling down her cheeks , that God would yet save to Himself , and to good ends , the soul that she had failed to bring to Him . All previous irritation against Gustave was gone : all had melted into an ineffable compassion . When , a little before noon , Gustave was admitted by the servant into Isaura ’s salon , its desolate condition , stripped of all its pretty feminine elegancies , struck him with a sense of discomfort to himself which superseded any more remorseful sentiment . The day was intensely cold : the single log on the hearth did not burn ; there were only two or three chairs in the room ; even the carpet , which had been of gaily coloured Aubusson , was gone . His teeth chattered ; and he only replied by a dreary nod to the servant who informed him that Madame Venosta was gone out , and Mademoiselle had not yet quitted her own room . If there be a thing which a true Parisian of Rameau ’s stamp associates with love of woman , it is a certain sort of elegant surroundings , a pretty boudoir , a cheery hearth , an easy fauteuil . In the absence of such attributes , “
279370	279435	279368	279368	Venus	933	” If the Englishman invented the word comfort , it is the Parisian who most thoroughly comprehends the thing . And he resents the loss of it in any house where he has been accustomed to look for it , as a personal wrong to his feelings . Left for some minutes alone , Gustave occupied himself with kindling the log , and muttering , “
279449	279538	279368	279368	Venus	933	” He turned as he heard the rustle of a robe and a light slow step . Isaura stood before him . Her aspect startled him . He had come prepared to expect grave displeasure and a frigid reception . But the expression of Isaura ’s face was more kindly , more gentle , more tender , than he had seen it since the day she had accepted his suit . Knowing from his mother what his father had said to his prejudice , he thought within himself , “
279572	279611	279558	279558	she	6605	” He approached with a complacent self - assured mien , and took her hand , which she yielded to him quietly , leading her to one of the few remaining chairs , and seating himself beside her . “
279615	279629	279558	279558	she	6605	” he said , talking rapidly all the while he performed this ceremony , “
279729	279746	279747	279747	Gustave	551	me:”—and therewith he poured several pieces of gold and silver on the table beside her chair . “
279749	279754	279755	279755	I	0	” then said Isaura , “
279798	279799	279792	279792	its	7795	” “
279809	279841	279792	279792	its	7795	” interrupted Gustave , with a fervour which sounded somewhat theatrical and hollow . The girl smiled , not bitterly , not mockingly ; but Gustave did not like the smile . “
279845	279858	279842	279843	Poor Gustave	875	” she said , with a melancholy pathos in her soft voice , “
280052	280053	280047	280047	I	0	” “
280058	280059	280060	280060	I	0	” “
280081	280082	280068	280068	I	0	” “
280098	280099	280092	280092	You	875	” “
280134	280149	280150	280150	I	0	” she added , falteringly , with heightened colour and with hands tightly clasped , “
280251	280252	280253	280253	You	875	” “
280260	280261	280253	280253	You	875	” “
280430	280431	280432	280432	Isaura	454	” “
280434	280480	280432	280432	Isaura	454	” exclaimed Gustave , his mobile temperament impressed , not by the words of Isaura , but by the passionate earnestness with which they were uttered , and by the exquisite spiritual beauty which her face took from the combined sweetness and fervour of its devout expression,—“Isaura
280677	280678	280665	280666	my God	7810	” “
280681	280687	280665	280666	my God	7810	” said Isaura , softly , “
280702	280719	280721	280721	they	7814	” she continued , checking his answer with a more kindling countenance and more impassioned voice . “
280849	280867	280836	280836	thou	7823	” Stung to the quick by the truth of Isaura ’s accusation , Gustave exclaimed with vehemence : “
281018	281071	281002	281002	thou	7823	” Isaura turned aside her face , but she held out her hand — it was as cold as death . He knew that she had so far yielded , and his vanity exulted : he smiled in secret triumph as he pressed his kiss on that icy hand and was gone . “
281081	281087	281002	281002	thou	7823	” said Isaura to herself . “
281104	281329	281002	281002	thou	7823	” And then she stole with drooping head and heavy step into her own room , fell on her knees , and prayed . In vain persons , be they male or female , there is a complacent self - satisfaction in any momentary personal success , however little that success may conduce to — nay , however much it may militate against — the objects to which their vanity itself devotes its more permanent desires . A vain woman may be very anxious to win A — — — , the magnificent , as a partner for life ; and yet feel a certain triumph when a glance of her eye has made an evening ’s conquest of the pitiful B———- , although by that achievement she incurs the imminent hazard of losing A — — — altogether . So , when Gustave Rameau quitted Isaura , his first feeling was that of triumph . His eloquence had subdued her will ; she had not finally discarded him . But as he wandered abstractedly in the biting air , his self - complacency was succeeded by mortification and discontent . He felt that he had committed himself to promises which he was by no means prepared to keep . True , the promises were vague in words ; but in substance they were perfectly clear—“to
281343	281458	281558	281558	she	9303	” How was this possible to him ? How could he suddenly change the whole character of his writings?—how become the defender of marriage and property , of church and religion?—how proclaim himself so utter an apostate ? If he did , how become a leader of the fresh revolution ? how escape being its victim ? Cease to write altogether ? But then how live ? His pen was his sole subsistence , save 30 sous a - day as a National Guard—30 sous a day to him , who , in order to be Sybarite in tastes , was Spartan in doctrine . Nothing better just at that moment than Spartan doctrine , “
281468	281499	281558	281558	she	9303	” And the journalists in vogue so thrived upon that patriotic sentiment , that they were the last persons compelled to drink the black broth or to fight the enemy . “
281511	281529	281500	281501	Those women	7379	” grumbled between his teeth the enthusiastic advocate of Woman ’s Rights on all matters of love . “
281532	281538	281544	281545	the girl	9303	” he continued , soliloquising , “
281691	281820	281821	281822	Mon homme	13765	” Just as he arrived at that conclusion , Gustave Rameau felt the touch of a light , a soft , a warm , yet a firm hand , on his aria . He turned , and beheld the face of the woman whom , through so many dreary weeks , he had sought to shun — the face of Julie Caumartin . Julie was not , as Savarin had seen her , looking pinched and wan , with faded robes , nor , as when met in the cafe by Lemercier , in the faded robes of a theatre . Julie never looked more beautiful , more radiant , than she did now ; and there was a wonderful heartfelt fondness in her voice when she cried , “
281851	281941	281840	281840	I	0	” Gustave gazed upon her , stupefied . Involuntarily his eye glanced from the freshness of bloom in her face which the intense cold of the atmosphere only seemed to heighten into purer health , to her dress , which was new and handsome — black — he did not know that it was mourning — the cloak trimmed with costly sables . Certainly it was no mendicant for alms who thus reminded the shivering Adonis of the claims of a pristine Venus . He stammered out her naive , “
281942	281947	281951	281951	Julie	585	Julie!”—and then he stopped . “
282030	282031	282023	282023	thee	585	” “
282067	282068	282091	282092	an obus	7838	” “
282074	282075	282091	282092	an obus	7838	” “
282094	282095	282091	282092	an obus	7838	” “
282116	282117	282091	282092	an obus	7838	” “
282120	282126	282091	282092	an obus	7838	” muttered Gustave , inwardly , “
282148	282149	282091	282092	an obus	7838	” “
282152	282158	282091	282092	an obus	7838	” he said , aloud , “
282223	282224	282216	282216	I	0	” “
282274	282275	282277	282277	my	0	” “
282306	282307	282295	282295	You	7848	” “
282347	282348	282369	282369	you	7848	” “
282354	282355	282369	282369	you	7848	” “
282506	282507	282508	282508	My	0	” “
282514	282519	282508	282508	My	0	” exclaimed the Poet . “
282609	282610	282604	282604	Gustave	551	” “
282619	282620	282604	282604	Gustave	551	” “
282713	282714	282717	282717	she	9237	” “
282860	282861	282871	282871	Thou	7864	” “
282898	282921	282894	282894	she	585	” Gustave had not anticipated that frankness , nor was the idea which it expressed uppermost in his mind when he said , “
282926	282961	282962	282962	My	0	” There were many buts all very confused , struggling through his mind as he spoke . However , he answered as a Parisian sceptic , not ill - bred , naturally would answer : “
282969	282988	282962	282962	My	0	” ( the Parisian is very fond of the word child or enfant in addressing a woman ) , “
283043	283044	283047	283048	mon homme	13765	” “
283169	283232	283162	283162	I	0	” Gustave had been hitherto walking slowly by the side of Julie , amidst the distant boom of the besiegers ’ cannon , while the short day began to close ; and along the dreary boulevards sauntered idlers turning to look at the young , beautiful , well - dressed woman who seemed in such contrast to the capital whose former luxuries the “
283234	283256	283162	283162	I	0	” of imperial Paris represented . He now offered his arm to Julie ; and , quickening his pace , said , “
283282	283283	283275	283275	thou	7871	” “
283296	283436	283275	283275	thou	7871	” said Gustave to himself when he entered Julie ’s apartment . In her palmier days , when he had first made her acquaintance , the apartment no doubt had been infinitely more splendid , more abundant in silks and fringes and flowers and nicknacks ; but never had it seemed so cheery and comfortable and home - like as now . What a contrast to Isaura ’s dismantled chilly salon ! She drew him towards the hearth , on which , blazing though it was , she piled fresh billets , seated him in the easiest of easy - chairs , knelt beside him , and chafed his numbed hands in hers ; and as her bright eyes fixed tenderly on his , she looked so young and so innocent ! You would not then have called her the “
283441	283514	283275	283275	thou	7871	” But when , a little while after , revived by the genial warmth and moved by the charm of her beauty , Gustave passed his arm round her neck and sought to draw her on his lap , she slid from his embrace , shaking her head gently , and seated herself , with a pretty air of ceremonious decorum , at a little distance . Gustave looked at her amazed . “
283517	283523	283515	283515	Causons	1064	” said she , gravely , “
283781	283928	283929	283929	I	0	“ There was an earnestness in the voice and look of this Monsieur that impressed me . He did not offer me his arm ; but I walked by his side in the direction he chose . As we walked he told me in very few words that my mother had been separated from her husband , and for certain family reasons had found it so difficult to rear and provide for me herself , that she had accepted the offer of Madame Surville to adopt me as her own child . While he spoke , there came dimly back to me the remembrance of a lady who had taken me from my first home , when I had been , as I understood , at nurse , and left me with poor dear Madame Surville , saying , ‘ This is henceforth your mamma . ’ “
284130	284156	284165	284165	you	0	” Gustave had listened very attentively , and without interruption , until now ; when he looked up , and said with his customary sneer , “
284188	284189	284165	284165	you	0	” “
284192	284196	284165	284165	you	0	” answered Julie , “
284324	284325	284311	284312	the Monsieur	7888	” “
284341	284342	284333	284333	you	0	” “
284353	284354	284345	284345	he	7888	” “
284427	284433	284436	284436	Gustave	551	” Julie ’s eyes flashed . “
284442	284452	284440	284440	Monsieur	7903	” she said , half angrily , half plaintively , “
284481	284482	284473	284473	Thou	7905	” “
284493	284500	284485	284485	I	0	” said Gustave , somewhat disconcerted . “
284535	284536	284528	284528	thou	7905	” “
284587	284602	284567	284567	He	7906	who”—she paused for a moment with an expression of compressed anguish , and then hurried on—“who
284638	284639	284620	284620	I	0	” “
284643	284645	284620	284620	I	0	” faltered Gustave—“marry
284647	284648	284620	284620	I	0	” “
284651	284661	284662	284662	he	7906	” continued the girl , not heeding his interruption , “
284713	284714	284705	284705	I	0	” “
284717	284726	284705	284705	I	0	” resumed Rameau , with an affected laugh , “
284742	284755	284736	284736	Thou	7909	” He approached again , seeking to embrace her . She recoiled . “
284798	284844	284783	284783	I	0	” Before Gustave could reply to these words , which took him wholly by surprise , there was a ring at the outer door , and the old bonne ushered in Victor de Mauleon . He halted at the threshold , and his brow contracted . “
284856	284857	284846	284846	you	551	” “
284868	284874	284862	284862	I	0	” cried Julie ; passionately . “
284943	284985	284994	284994	Mademoiselle	585	” The Vicomte turned his stern look upon Gustave , who though , as we know , not wanting in personal courage , felt cowed by his false position ; and his eye fell , quailed before De Mauleon ’s gaze . “
284996	285001	284994	284994	Mademoiselle	585	” said the Vicomte . “
285006	285014	285004	285004	Julie	585	” he added , in softened tones , “
285032	285075	285076	285076	Monsieur	1758	” With his habitual courtesy towards women , he extended his hand to Julie , and led her from the room . Then , closing the door , he seated himself , and made a sign to Gustave to do the same . “
285078	285083	285076	285076	Monsieur	1758	” said De Mauleon , “
285297	285298	285299	285299	You	1758	” “
285309	285313	285299	285299	You	1758	” said Rameau , “
285322	285328	285315	285315	I	0	” He added , feelingly : “
285360	285410	285356	285358	M. le Vicomte	898	” He bowed with a dignity unusual to him , and tears were in his eyes as he passed by De Mauleon and gained the anteroom . There a side - door suddenly opened , and Julie ’s face , anxious , eager , looked forth . Gustave paused : “
285438	285461	285429	285429	I	0	” The girl interrupted him , impulsively seizing his arm , and looking him in the face with a wild fixed stare . “
285475	285476	285465	285465	thou	7924	” “
285479	285483	285465	285465	thou	7924	” said Gustave , “
285521	285565	285566	285568	My young ward	7926	” Julie turned her eyes towards De Mauleon , who , following Gustave into the ante - room , stood silent and impassive , leaning against the wall . He now understood and replied to the pathetic appeal in the girl ’s eyes . “
285570	285574	285566	285568	My young ward	7926	” he said , “
285602	285677	285678	285678	You	7927	” He advanced to take her hand , making a sign to Gustave to depart . But as he approached Julie , she uttered a weak piteous wail , and fell at his feet senseless . De Mauleon raised and carried her into her room , where he left her to the care of the old bonne . On re - entering the anteroom , he found Gustave still lingering by the outer door . “
285685	285692	285678	285678	You	7927	” he said to the Vicomte , “
285755	285771	285786	285786	Rameau	551	” De Mauleon remained a few minutes musing . Then he said in a whisper , “
285783	285784	285786	285786	Rameau	551	” “
285788	285804	285786	285786	Rameau	551	” said De Mauleon , when the two men had reseated themselves in the salon , “
286121	286122	286092	286092	I	0	” “
286129	286135	286092	286092	I	0	” asked Gustave , perplexed . “
286258	286304	286246	286247	the Signorina	9584	” Gustave hung his head in some shame , and in much bewildered doubt . The practised observer of men ’s characters , and of shifting phases of mind , glanced at the poor poet ’s perturbed countenance with a half - smile of disdain . “
286706	286768	286695	286695	I	0	” The short grim day was closing when Gustave , quitting Julie ’s apartment , again found himself in the streets . His thoughts were troubled and confused . He was the more affected by Julie ’s impassioned love for him , by the contrast with Isaura ’s words and manner in their recent interview . His own ancient fancy for the “
286772	286801	286695	286695	I	0	” became revived by the difficulties between their ancient intercourse which her unexpected scruples and De Mauleon ’s guardianship interposed . A witty writer thus defines une passion , “
286809	286934	286695	286695	I	0	” In the ordinary times of peace , Gustave , handsome , aspiring to reputable position in the beau monde , would not have admitted any considerations to compromise his station by marriage with a fagurante . But now the wild political doctrines he had embraced separated his ambition from that beau monde , and combined it with ascendancy over the revolutionists of the populace — a direction which he must abandon if he continued his suit to Isaura . Then , too , the immediate possession of Julie ’s dot was not without temptation to a man who was so fond of his personal comforts , and who did not see where to turn for a dinner , if , obedient to Isaura ’s “
286937	287245	286695	286695	I	0	” he abandoned his profits as a writer in the revolutionary press . The inducements for withdrawal from the cause he had espoused , held out to him with so haughty a coldness by De Mauleon , were not wholly without force , though they irritated his self - esteem . He was dimly aware of the Vicomte ’s masculine talents for public life ; and the high reputation he had already acquired among military authorities , and even among experienced and thoughtful civilians , had weight upon Gustave ’s impressionable temperament . But though De Mauleon ’s implied advice here coincided in much with the tacit compact he had made with Isaura , it alienated him more from Isaura herself , for Isaura did not bring to him the fortune which would enable him to suspend his lucubrations , watch the turn of events , and live at ease in the meanwhile ; and the dot to be received with De Mauleon ’s ward had those advantages . While thus meditating Gustave turned into one of the cantines still open , to brighten his intellect with a petit verre , and there he found the two colleagues in the extinct Council of Ten , Paul Grimm and Edgar Ferrier . With the last of these revolutionists Gustave had become intimately lie . They wrote in the same journal , and he willingly accepted a distraction from his self - conflict which Edgar offered him in a dinner at the cafe Riche , which still offered its hospitalities at no exorbitant price . At this repast , as the drink circulated , Gustave waxed confidential . He longed , poor youth , for an adviser . Could he marry a girl who had been a ballet - dancer , and who had come into an unexpected heritage ? “
287253	287257	286695	286695	I	0	” cried Edgar . “
287367	287569	287570	287570	I	0	” Though there was enough of good in the son of Madame Rameau to revolt at the precise words in which the counsel was given , still , as the fumes of the punch yet more addled his brains , the counsel itself was acceptable ; and in that sort of maddened fury which intoxication produces in some excitable temperaments , as Gustave reeled home that night leaning on the arm of stouter Edgar Ferrier , he insisted on going out of his way to pass the house in which Isaura lived , and , pausing under her window , gasped out some verses of a wild song , then much in vogue among the votaries of Felix Pyat , in which everything that existent society deems sacred was reviled in the grossest ribaldry . Happily Isaura ’s ear heard it not . The girl was kneeling by her bedside absorbed in prayer . Three days after the evening thus spent by Gustave Rameau , Isaura was startled by a visit from M. de Mauleon . She had not seen him since the commencement of the siege , and she did not recognise him at first glance in his military uniform . “
287580	287597	287572	287572	you	7978	” he said , in the low sweet voice habitual to him in his gentler moods , “
287659	287710	287645	287645	She	7980	” Isaura had no cause to mourn the dead , but she felt a shock in the suddenness of this information ; and in that sweet spirit of womanly compassion which entered so largely into her character , and made a part of her genius itself , she murmured tearfully , “
287758	287759	287753	287753	Her	7982	” “
287867	287868	287865	287865	you	585	” “

287893	287906	287908	287908	he	551	” Isaura turned pale and recoiled , but she did not speak . “
287988	287989	287994	287994	Monsieur	7990	” “
287996	288005	288007	288007	you	7990	” exclaimed Isaura , her whole face brightening ; “

288044	288051	288041	288041	I	0	” answered De Mauleon , smiling , “

288558	288600	288601	288601	I	0	” Here he took forth and placed a letter in Isaura ’s hand ; and , as if to allow her to read it unobserved , retired to the window recess . Isaura glanced over the letter . It ran thus : “
288755	288756	288758	288758	I	0	” “
288770	288785	288787	288787	my	0	” asked De Mauleon , turning as she replaced the letter on the table . “
288821	288822	288823	288823	Mademoiselle	585	” “
288956	288991	288947	288947	I	0	” Left alone , Isaura stood as one transfigured . All the bloom of her youth seemed suddenly restored . Round her red lips the dimples opened , countless mirrors of one happy smile . “
289000	289002	288996	288996	I	0	” she murmured—“joy
289006	289115	288996	288996	I	0	” and she passed from the room to seek the Venosta , singing clear , singing loud , as a bird that escapes from the cage and warbles to the heaven it regains the blissful tale of its release . In proportion to the nearer roar of the besiegers ’ cannon , and the sharper gripe of famine within the walls , the Parisians seemed to increase their scorn for the skill of the enemy , and their faith in the sanctity of the capital . All false news was believed as truth ; all truthful news abhorred as falsehood . Listen to the groups round the cafes . “
289128	289147	288996	288996	I	0	” says a threadbare ghost of the Bourse ( he had been a clerk of Louvier ’s ) . “

289236	289243	289257	289257	Trochu	1050	” whispered Savarin to De Breze , “
289296	289297	289298	289299	The Prussians	896	” “
289303	289318	289298	289299	The Prussians	896	” cried Edgar Ferrier , catching the last word and glancing fiercely at Savarin . “
289374	289430	289431	289431	I	0	” Edgar Ferrier was the sole member of his political party among the group which he thus addressed ; but such was the terror which the Communists already began to inspire among the bourgeoisie that no one volunteered a reply . Savarin linked his arm in De Breze ’s , and prudently drew him off . “
289434	289439	289431	289431	I	0	” said the former , “

289779	289784	289785	289785	I	0	” answered De Breze . “

289921	289933	289909	289909	his	352	” said De Breze , feebly seizing him by the arm , “
289965	289966	289959	289959	Thou	8046	” “
290005	290006	290007	290007	Fox	555	” “
290011	290021	290007	290007	Fox	555	” cried De Breze , with sparkling hungry eyes . “
290040	290041	290026	290026	he	555	” “
290161	290162	290159	290159	Savarin	431	” “
290167	290171	290159	290159	Savarin	431	” sighed Savarin , “
290239	290240	290241	290241	Thou	8046	” “
290260	290266	290241	290241	Thou	8046	” said Frederic , pathetically . “
290326	290327	290328	290328	I	0	” “
290335	290340	290328	290328	I	0	” cried De Breze . “
290363	290399	290354	290354	I	0	” So saying , he sprang forward with an elasticity of step which no one could have anticipated from his previous languor . Frederic would have followed , but Savarin clung to him , whimpering : “
290489	290490	290487	290487	Balthazar	297	” “
290493	290499	290500	290500	thou	555	” said Frederic , doubtfully ; “
290510	290511	290503	290503	he	514	” “
290564	290768	290557	290557	Fox	555	” Before Frederic could reply , the two men were jostled and swept on by a sudden rush of a noisy crowd in their rear . They could but distinguish the words — Glorious news — victory — Faidherbe — Chanzy . But these words were sufficient to induce them to join willingly in the rush . They forgot their hunger ; they forget Fox . As they were hurried on , they learned that there was a report of a complete defeat of the Prussians by Faidherbe near Amiens , of a still more decided one on the Loire by Chanzy . These generals , with armies flushed with triumph , were pressing on towards Paris to accelerate the destruction of the hated Germans . How the report arose no one exactly knew . All believed it , and were making their way to the Hotel de Ville to hear it formally confirmed . Alas ! before , they got there they were met by another crowd returning , dejected but angry . No such news had reached the Government . Chanzy and Faidherbe were no doubt fighting bravely,—with every probability of success ; but — The Parisian imagination required no more . “
290777	290781	290557	290557	Fox	555	” said Savarin , “
290790	290984	290557	290557	Fox	555	” and his audience , who , had he so expressed himself ten minutes before , would have torn him to pieces , now applauded the epigram ; and with execrations on Trochu , mingled with many a peal of painful sarcastic laughter , vociferated and dispersed . As the two friends sauntered back towards the part of the Boulevards on which De Breze had parted company with them , Savarin quitted Lemercier suddenly , and crossed the street to accost a small party of two ladies and two men who were on their way to the Madeleine . While he was exchanging a few words with them , a young couple , arm in arm , passed by Lemercier,—the man in the uniform of the National Guard - uniform as unsullied as Frederic ’s , but with as little of a military air as can well be conceived . His gait was slouching ; his head bent downwards . He did not seem to listen to his companion , who was talking with quickness and vivacity , her fair face radiant with smiles . Lemercier looked at them as they passed by . “
290989	290995	290557	290557	Fox	555	” muttered Frederic to himself , “
291014	291347	291004	291004	she	8064	” While Lemercier thus soliloquised , Gustave , still looking down , was led across the street by his fair companion , and into the midst of the little group with whom Savarin had paused to speak . Accidentally brushing against Savarin himself , he raised his eyes with a start , about to mutter some conventional apology , when Julie felt the arm on which she leant tremble nervously . Before him stood Isaura , the Countess de Vandemar by her side ; her two other companions , Raoul and the Abbe Vertpre , a step or two behind . Gustave uncovered , bowed low , and stood mute and still for a moment , paralysed by surprise and the chill of a painful shame . Julie ’s watchful eyes , following his , fixed themselves on the same face . On the instant she divined the truth . She beheld her to whom she had owed months of jealous agony , and over whom , poor child , she thought she had achieved a triumph . But the girl ’s heart was so instinctively good that the sense of triumph was merged in a sense of compassion . Her rival had lost Gustave . To Julie the loss of Gustave was the loss of all that makes life worth having . On her part , Isaura was moved not only by the beauty of Julie ’s countenance , but still more by the childlike ingenuousness of its expression . So , for the first time in their lives , met the child and the stepchild of Louise Duval . Each so deserted , each so left alone and inexperienced amid the perils of the world , with fates so different , typifying orders of womanhood so opposed . Isaura was naturally the first to break the silence that weighed like a sensible load on all present . She advanced towards Rameau , with sincere kindness in her look and tone . “
291352	291361	291362	291363	Your mother	9587	” she said , with a grave smile . “
291378	291485	291376	291378	Madame Gustave Rameau;”—and	1077	Rameau;”—and she extended her hand towards Julie . The poor Ondine shrank back for a moment , blushing up to her temples . It was the first hand which a woman of spotless character had extended to her since she had lost the protection of Madame Surville . She touched it timidly , humbly , then drew her bridegroom on ; and with head more downcast than Gustave , passed through the group without a word . She did not speak to Gustave till they were out of sight and hearing of those they had left . Then , pressing his arm passionately , she said : “
291559	291571	291546	291546	Thou	8067	” Savarin looked very grave and thoughtful when he rejoined Lemercier . “
291578	291582	291546	291546	Thou	8067	” said Frederic . “
291653	291654	291655	291655	I	0	” “
291695	291809	291687	291688	De Breze	514	” Unprescient of the perils that awaited him , absorbed in the sense of existing discomfort , cold , and hunger , Fox lifted his mournful visage from his master ’s dressing - gown , in which he had encoiled his shivering frame , on the entrance of De Breze and the concierge of the house in which Lemercier had his apartment . Recognising the Vicomte as one of his master ’s acquaintances , he checked the first impulse that prompted him to essay a feeble bark , and permitted himself , with a petulant whine , to be extracted from his covering , and held in the arms of the murderous visitor . “
291814	291819	291687	291688	De Breze	514	” ejaculated De Breze , “
291828	291840	291910	291910	Monsieur	8072	” Here he pinched the sides and thighs of the victim . “
291843	291847	291910	291910	Monsieur	8072	” he said , “
291884	291898	291879	291879	yourself	8071	” Here he transferred Fox to the arms of the concierge , adding , “
291906	291907	291910	291910	Monsieur	8072	” “
291942	291943	291932	291932	He	13718	” “
291964	292082	292083	292083	Fox	555	” The concierge disappeared with Fox . De Breze then amused himself by searching into Frederic ’s cupboards and buffets , from which he produced a cloth and utensils necessary for the repast . These he arranged with great neatness , and awaited in patience the moment of participation in the feast . The hour of five had struck before Savarin and Frederio entered the salon ; and at their sight De Breze dashed to the staircase and called out to the concierge to serve the dinner . Frederic , though unconscious of the Thyestean nature of the banquet , still looked round for the dog ; and , not perceiving him , began to call out , “
292093	292094	292096	292096	yourself	8077	” “
292098	292103	292096	292096	yourself	8077	” said De Breze . “
292112	292297	292301	292301	Fox	555	” NOTE BY THE AUTHOR ’S SON.—[See also Prefatory Note]—The hand that wrote thus far has left unwritten the last scene of the tragedy of poor Fox . In the deep where Prospero has dropped his wand are now irrevocably buried the humour and the pathos of this cynophagous banquet . One detail of it , however , which the author imparted to his son , may here be faintly indicated . Let the sympathising reader recognise all that is dramatic in the conflict between hunger and affection ; let him recall to mind the lachrymose loving - kindness of his own post - prandial emotions after blissfully breaking some fast , less mercilessly prolonged , we will hope , than that of these besieged banqueters , and then , though unaided by the fancy which conceived so quaint a situation , he may perhaps imagine what tearful tenderness would fill the eyes of the kind - hearted Frederic , as they contemplate the well - picked bones of his sacrificed favourite on the plate before him ; which he pushes away , sighing , “
292311	292630	292304	292304	he	555	” The chapter immediately following this one also remains unfinished . It was not intended to close the narrative thus left uncompleted ; but of those many and so various works which have not unworthily associated with almost every department of literature the name of a single English writer , it is CHAPTER THE LAST . Had the author lived to finish it , he would doubtless have added to his Iliad of the Siege of Paris its most epic episode , by here describing the mighty combat between those two princes of the Parisian Bourse , the magnanimous Duplessis and the redoubtable Louvier . Amongst the few other pages of the book which have been left unwritten , we must also reckon with regret some pages descriptive of the reconciliation between Graham Vane and Isaura Cicogna ; but , fortunately for the satisfaction of every reader who may have followed thus far the fortunes of Die Parisians , all that our curiosity is chiefly interested to learn has been recorded in the Envoi , which was written before the completion of the novel . We know not , indeed , what has become of these two Parisian types of a Beauty not of Holiness , the poor vain Poet of the Pave , and the good - hearted Ondine of the Gutter . It is obvious , from the absence of all allusion to them in Lemercier ’s letter to Vane , that they had passed out of the narrative before that letter was written . We must suppose the catastrophe of their fates to have been described , in some preceding chapter , by the author himself ; who would assuredly not have left 141 . Gustave Rameau in permanent pos session of his ill - merited and ill - ministered fortune . That French representative of the appropriately popular poetry of modern ideas , which prefers “
292637	292639	292906	292907	Bon jour	494	” to “
292647	292837	292906	292907	Bon jour	494	” can not have been irredeemably reconciled by the sweet savours of the domestic pot - au jeu , even when spiced with pungent whiffs of repudiated disreputability , to any selfish betrayal of the cause of universal social emancipation from the personal proprieties . If poor Julie Caumartin has perished in the siege of Paris , with all the grace of a self - wrought redemption still upon her , we shall doubtless deem her fate a happier one than any she could have found in prolonged existence as Madame Rameau ; and a certain modicum of this world ’s good things will , in that case , have been rescued for worthier employment by Graham Vane . To that assurance nothing but Lemercier ’s description of the fate of Victor de Mauleon ( which will be found in the Envoi ) need be added for the satisfaction of our sense of poetic justice and if on the mimic stage , from which they now disappear , all these puppets have rightly played their parts in the drama of an empire ’s fall , each will have helped to “

293248	293681	293682	293685	Dear and distinguished Englishman	8091	” The intelligent reader will perceive that the story I relate is virtually closed with the preceding chapter ; though I rejoice to think that what may be called its plot does not find its denouement amidst the crimes and the frenzy of the Guerre des Communeaux . Fit subjects these , indeed , for the social annalist in times to come . When crimes that outrage humanity have their motive or their excuse in principles that demand the demolition of all upon which the civilisation of Europe has its basis - worship , property , and marriage — in order to reconstruct a new civilisation adapted to a new humanity , it is scarcely possible for the serenest contemporary to keep his mind in that state of abstract reasoning with which Philosophy deduces from some past evil some existent good . For my part , I believe that throughout the whole known history of mankind , even in epochs when reason is most misled and conscience most perverted , there runs visible , though fine and threadlike , the chain of destiny , which has its roots in the throne of an All - wise and an All - good ; that in the wildest illusions by which muititudes are frenzied , there may be detected gleams of prophetic truths ; that in the fiercest crimes which , like the disease of an epidemic , characterise a peculiar epoch under abnormal circumstances , there might be found instincts or aspirations towards some social virtues to be realised ages afterwards by happier generations , all tending to save man from despair of the future , were the whole society to unite for the joyless hour of his race in the abjuration of soul and the denial of God , because all irresistibly establishing that yearning towards an unseen future which is the leading attribute of soul , evincing the government of a divine Thought which evolves out of the discords of one age the harmonies of another , and , in the world within us as in the world without , enforces upon every unclouded reason the distinction between Providence and chance . The account subjoined may suffice to say all that rests to be said of those individuals in whose fate , apart from the events or personages that belong to graver history , the reader of this work may have conceived an interest . It is translated from the letter of Frederic Lemercier to Graham Vane , dated June — — , a month after the defeat of the Communists . “

At this rouge et noir table , all I can say is , that whichever card turns up , it is either a red or a black one . One gamester gains for the moment by the loss of the other ; the table eventually ruins both . “

I and all the quiet folks like me ( we are more numerous than any one violent faction ) are willing to accept any form of government by which we have the best chance of keeping our coats on our backs . Liberte , Egalite , Fraternity , are gone quite out of fashion ; and Mademoiselle — has abandoned her great chant of the Marseillaise , and is drawing tears from enlightened audiences by her pathetic delivery of ‘ O Richard ! O mon roi ! ’ ”

294787	294961	294780	294780	Louvier	399	“ I have all this story from Alain , and from Duplessis himself . I tell the tale as ‘ twas told to me , with all the gloss of sentiment upon its woof . But between ourselves , I am too Parisian not to be sceptical as to the unalloyed amiability of sudden conversions . And I suspect that Louvier was no longer in a condition to indulge in the unprofitable whim of turning rural seigneur . He had sunk large sums and incurred great liabilities in the new street to be called after his name ; and that street has been twice ravaged , first by the Prussian siege , and next by the Guerre des Communeaux ; and I can detect many reasons why Louvier should deem it prudent not only to withdraw from the Rochebriant seizure , and make sure of peacefully recovering the capital lent on it , but establishing joint interest and quasi partnership with a financier so brilliant and successful as Armand Duplessis has hitherto been . “
295043	295105	295106	295106	I	0	“ I reserve as my last communication , in reply to your questions , that which is the gravest . You say that you saw in the public journals brief notice of the assassination of Victor de Mauleon ; and you ask for such authentic particulars as I can give of that event , and of the motives of the assassin . “
295301	295416	295287	295287	he	351	“ He escaped safe through that horrible war of barricades , though no man more courted danger . He inspired his men with his own courage . It was not till the revolt was quenched on the evening of the 28th May that he met his death . The Versailles soldiers , naturally exasperated , were very prompt in seizing and shooting at once every passenger who looked like a foe . Some men under De Mauleon had seized upon one of these victims , and were hurrying him into the next street for execution , when , catching sight of the Vicomte , he screamed out , ‘ Lebeau , save me ! ’ “
295488	295558	295468	295468	himself	8181	“ The Vicomte was carried into a neighbouring house , from all the windows of which the tricolour was suspended ; and the Medecin whom he had just saved from summary execution examined and dressed his wound . The Vicomte lingered for more than an hour , but expired in the effort to utter some words , the sense of which those about him endeavoured in vain to seize . “
295676	295866	295876	295878	This Jean Lebeau	632	“ These schemes , however , he did not put into any positive practice till he fell in with a certain Jean Lebeau , who exercised great influence over him , and by whom he was admitted into one of the secret revolutionary societies which had for their object the overthrow of the Empire . After that time his head became turned . The fall of the Empire put an end to the society he had joined : Lebeau dissolved it . During the siege Monnier was a sort of leader among the ouvriers ; but as it advanced and famine commenced , he contracted the habit of intoxication . His children died of cold and hunger . The woman he lived with followed them to the grave . Then he seems to have become a ferocious madman , and to have been implicated in the worst crimes of the Communists . He cherished a wild desire of revenge against this Jean Lebeau , to whom he attributed all his calamities , and by whom , he said , his brother had been shot in the sortie of December . “
296130	296242	296127	296127	he	8507	“ The Medecin who told this story I had the curiosity to see myself , and cross - question . I own I believe his statement . Whether De Mauleon did or did not conspire against a fallen dynasty , to which he owed no allegiance , can little , if at all , injure the reputation he has left behind of a very remarkable man — of great courage and great ability — who might have had a splendid career if he had survived . But , as Savarin says truly , the first bodies which the car of revolution crushes down are those which first harness themselves to it . “
296306	296423	296301	296301	They	8213	“ The American republic is the sole one worth studying , for it has lasted . The causes of its duration are in the checks to democratic fickleness and disorder . 1st . No law affecting the Constitution can be altered without the consent of two - thirds of Congress . 2nd . To counteract the impulses natural to a popular Assembly chosen by universal suffrage , the greater legislative powers , especially in foreign affairs , are vested in the Senate , which has even executive as well as legislative functions . 3rd . The Chief of the State , having elected his government , can maintain it independent of hostile majorities in either Assembly . “
296441	296539	296540	296540	Savarin	431	“ ‘ For France it is essential that the chief magistrate , under whatever title he assume , should be as irresponsible as an English sovereign . Therefore he should not preside at his councils ; he should not lead his armies . The day for personal government is gone , even in Prussia . The safety for order in a State is that , when things go wrong , the Ministry changes , the State remains the same . In Europe , Republican institutions are safer where the chief magistrate is hereditary than where elective . ’ “
296556	296630	296540	296540	Savarin	431	“ I am very grateful for your proffered hospitalities in England . Some day I shall accept them - viz . , whenever I decide on domestic life , and the calm of the conjugal foyer . I have a penchant for an English Mees , and am not exacting as to the dot . Thirty thousand livres sterling would satisfy me — a trifle , I believe , to you rich islanders . “

Upon the part of the craggy shore , to the left of the town , on which her first perusal of the loveliest poem in which the romance of Christian heroism has ever combined elevation of thought with silvery delicacies of speech , had charmed her childhood , reclined the young bride of Graham Vane . They were in the first month of their marriage . Isaura had not yet recovered from the effects of all that had preyed upon her life , from the hour in which she had deemed that in her pursuit of fame she had lost the love that had coloured her genius and inspired her dreams , to that in which .... The physicians consulted agreed in insisting on her passing the winter in a southern climate ; and after their wedding , which took place in Florence , they thus came to Sorrento . As Isaura is seated on the small smoothed rock , Graham reclines at her feet , his face upturned to hers with an inexpressible wistful anxiety in his impassioned tenderness . “
