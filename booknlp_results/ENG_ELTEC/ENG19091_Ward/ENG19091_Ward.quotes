0	6	109	110	the General	289	“ A STIFLING hot day ! ”
18	65	66	67	Roger Barnes	121	“ What on earth this place can be like in June I ca n't conceive ! The tenth of April , and I 'll be bound the thermometer 's somewhere near eighty in the shade . You never find the English climate playing you these tricks . ”
75	96	66	67	Roger Barnes	121	“ Do n't you like heat , Uncle Archie ? Ah , but I forgot , it 's American heat . ”
97	107	109	110	the General	289	“ I like a climate you can depend on , ”
137	183	115	115	he	289	“ Here we are sweltering in this abominable heat , and in New York last week they had a blizzard , and here , even , it was cold enough to give me rheumatism . The climate 's always in extremes — like the people . ”
184	200	201	203	The young man	290	“ I 'm sorry to find you do n't like the States , Uncle Archie . ”
327	340	341	342	the General	289	“ And I consider all the arrangements for this trip most unsatisfactory , ”
346	405	341	342	the General	289	“ The steamer 's too small , the landing - place is too small , the crowd getting on board was something disgraceful . They 'll have a shocking accident one of these days . And what on earth are all these women here for — in the middle of the day ? It 's not a holiday . ”
406	416	418	419	young Barnes	121	“ I believe it 's a teachers ' excursion , ”
454	459	460	461	The General	289	“ H'm — Teachers ! ”
469	705	460	461	The General	289	“ Going to learn more lies about us , I suppose , that they may teach them to school - children ? I was turning over some of their school - books in a shop yesterday . Perfectly abominable ! It 's monstrous what they teach the children here about what they 're pleased to call their War of Independence . All that we did was to ask them to pay something for their own protection . What did it matter to us whether they were mopped up by the Indians , or the French , or not ? ‘ But if you want us to go to all the expense and trouble of protecting you , and putting down those fellows , why , hang it , ’ we said , ‘ you must pay some of the bill ! ’ That was all English Ministers asked ; and perfectly right too . And as for the men they make such a fuss about , Samuel Adams , and John Adams , and Franklin , and all the rest of the crew , I tell you , the stuff they teach American school - children about them is a poisoning of the wells ! Franklin was a man of profligate life , whom I would never have admitted inside my doors ! And as for the Adamses — intriguers — canting fellows!—both of them . ”
706	718	720	720	he	307	“ Well , at least you 'll give them George Washington . ”
778	845	759	767	The red - faced , white - haired General	310	“ What George Washington might have been if he had held a straight course I am not prepared to say . As it is , I do n't hesitate for a moment ! George Washington was nothing more nor less than a rebel — a damned rebel ! And what Englishmen mean by joining in the worship of him I 've never been able to understand . ”
846	855	857	859	the young man	290	“ I say , uncle , take care , ”
880	890	857	859	the young man	290	“ These Yankees will stand most things , but — ”
891	900	759	767	The red - faced , white - haired General	310	“ You need n't trouble yourself , Roger , ”
906	942	759	767	The red - faced , white - haired General	310	“ I am not in the habit of annoying my neighbours . Well now , look here , what I want to know is , what is the meaning of this absurd journey of yours ? ”
960	971	950	950	He	290	“ I do n't know why you call it absurd ? ”
972	982	984	985	the other	314	“ To me it seems both absurd and extravagant , ”
989	1042	984	985	the other	314	“ The last thing I heard of you was that Burdon and Co. had offered you a place in their office , and that you were prepared to take it . When a man has lost his money and becomes dependent upon others , the sooner he gets to work the better . ”
1062	1078	1079	1079	he	290	“ I think my mother and I ought to be left to judge for ourselves , ”
1084	1129	1079	1079	he	290	“ We have n't asked anybody for money yet , Uncle Archie . Burdon and Co. can have me in September just as well as now ; and my mother wished me to make some friends over here who might be useful to me . ”
1130	1137	984	985	the other	314	“ Useful to you . How ? ”
1138	1167	1168	1169	The General	289	“ I think that 's my affair . In this country there are always openings — things turning up — chances — you ca n't get at home . ”
1175	1254	1168	1169	The General	289	“ The only chance that 'll help you , Roger , at present — excuse me if I speak frankly — is the chance of regular work . Your poor mother has nothing but her small fixed income , and you have n't a farthing to chuck away on what you call chances . Why , your passage by the Lucania alone must have cost a pretty penny . I 'll bet my hat you came first class . ”
1274	1321	1269	1269	himself	290	“ I paid the winter rate ; and mother , who knows the Cunard people very well , got a reduction . I assure you , Uncle Archie , neither mother nor I is a fool , and we know quite well what we are about . ”
1533	1536	1532	1534	The “ others	2698	“ others , ”
1631	1669	1629	1629	himself	290	“ He has n't a farthing but what poor Laura allows him ; he has the tastes of forty thousand a year ; a very indifferent education ; and what the deuce is he going to do ? ”
1674	1694	1671	1671	he	290	“ Well , all I know is , I had a deplorable letter last mail from your poor mother . ”
1711	1722	1699	1699	his	290	“ Yes , I know — mother 's awfully down . ”
1723	1737	1739	1740	the General	289	“ Well , certainly your mother was never meant for a poor woman , ”
1745	1752	1739	1740	the General	289	“ She takes it uncommonly hard . ”
1773	1791	1793	1794	the General	289	“ However , she 'll get along all right , if you do your duty by her , ”
1802	1811	1812	1812	Barnes	121	“ I mean to do it , sir . ”
1818	1838	1839	1839	He	289	“ I should think we 're getting near Mount Vernon by this time . I 'll go and look . ”
2006	2031	2033	2035	a young girl	355	“ Is n't it fine to think of his coming back here to die , so simply , when he 'd made a nation ? ”
2045	2052	2053	2053	Her	355	“ Was n't it just lovely ? ”
2088	2116	2079	2079	he	120	“ Much good it did them to be ‘ made a nation ’ ! Look at their press — look at their corruption — their divorce scandals ! ”
2132	2162	2079	2079	he	120	“ Upon my word , Uncle Archie , I ca n't play up to you . As far as I 've gone , I like America and the Americans . ”
2163	2189	2191	2192	the General	289	“ Which means , I suppose , that your mother gave you some introductions to rich people in New York , and they entertained you ? ”
2195	2214	2191	2192	the General	289	“ Well , is there any crime in that ? I met a lot of uncommonly nice people . ”
2215	2231	2232	2234	The young man	290	“ And did n't particularly bless me when I wired to you to come here ? ”
2244	2260	2232	2234	The young man	290	“ I 'm always very glad to come and keep you company , Uncle Archie . ”
2740	2744	2701	2701	Roger	121	“ livelier emerald . ”
2874	2879	2881	2882	the General	289	“ Who is it ? ”
2889	2900	2881	2882	the General	289	“ The girl we met last night and her brother . ”
2901	2918	2919	2925	The lady whom young Barnes had greeted	388	“ Captain Boyson ? So it is . They seem to have a party with them . ”
2936	2949	2950	2950	she	388	“ I did n't know we were to meet to - day , ”
2961	2977	2950	2950	she	388	“ I thought you said you were bored — and going back to New York . ”
3012	3024	3025	3025	he	2713	“ I am sure I never said anything of the kind , ”
3034	3042	3025	3025	he	2713	“ nothing in the least like it . ”
3043	3048	3049	3050	the lady	393	“ Oh ! oh ! ”
3058	3078	3079	3087	An elderly lady , quietly dressed in grey silk	394	“ Mrs. Phillips , this is Mr. Barnes . We were just talking of him , were n't we ? ”
3100	3114	3079	3087	An elderly lady , quietly dressed in grey silk	394	“ I hear you and Miss Boyson discovered some common friends last night . ”
3115	3148	3150	3150	Barnes	143	“ We did , indeed . Miss Boyson posted me up in a lot of the people I have been seeing in New York . I am most awfully obliged to her , ”
3171	3199	3201	3202	the girl	396	“ I behaved like a walking ‘ Who 's Who , ’ only I was much more interesting , and did n't tell half as many lies , ”
3210	3233	3201	3202	the girl	396	“ Daphne , let me introduce you to Mr. Barnes . Mr. Barnes — Miss Floyd ; Mr. Barnes — Mrs. Verrier . ”
3471	3476	3456	3457	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ creation in mauve . ”
3611	3625	3626	3626	he	289	“ I really can not congratulate you on your management of these affairs , ”
3650	3699	3626	3626	he	289	“ It is most improper , I may say dangerous , to admit such a number at once . And , as for seeing the house , it is simply impossible . I shall make my way down as soon as possible , and go for a walk . ”
3733	3745	3746	3746	He	120	“ Wait a moment ; I 'll try and find somebody . ”
3830	3842	3813	3814	Cecilia Boyson	147	“ How sad it is that your uncle dislikes us so ! ”
3843	3851	3813	3814	Cecilia Boyson	147	“ Us ? What you do mean ? ”
3852	3916	3813	3814	Cecilia Boyson	147	“ That he hates America so . Oh , do n't say he does n't , because I 've watched him , at one , two , three parties . He thinks we 're a horrid , noisy , vulgar people , with most unpleasant voices , and he thanks God for the Atlantic — and hopes he may never see us again . ”
3917	3960	3813	3814	Cecilia Boyson	147	“ Well , of course , if you 're so certain about it , there 's no good in contradicting you . Did you say that lady 's name was Floyd ? Could I have seen her last week in New York ? ”
3961	3972	3813	3814	Cecilia Boyson	147	“ Quite possible . Perhaps you heard something about her ? ”
3973	3976	3978	3978	Barnes	121	“ No , ”
3985	3997	3978	3978	Barnes	121	“ I remember — somebody pointed her out at the opera . ”
4034	4044	4045	4045	she	147	“ Well , when people begin upon Daphne Floyd , ”
4048	4062	4045	4045	she	147	“ they generally go through with it . Ah ! here comes Alfred . ”
4140	4143	4145	4146	Miss Floyd	145	“ Then , ”
4153	4170	4145	4146	Miss Floyd	145	“ let us go and sit in the garden , and feel ourselves aristocratic and superior . ”
4277	4292	4294	4295	Miss Boyson	141	“ Ah ! now you will see the General will begin to like us , ”
4297	4305	4294	4295	Miss Boyson	141	“ Daphne has got him in hand . ”
4329	4339	4312	4312	Barnes	121	“ very — well — a very foreign look . ”
4340	4378	4396	4396	his	446	“ Not English , you mean?—or American ? Well , naturally . Her mother was a Spaniard — a South American — from Buenos Ayres . That 's why she is so dark , and so graceful . ”
4379	4387	4389	4389	Barnes	121	“ I never saw a prettier dress , ”
4399	4405	4389	4389	Barnes	121	“ It 's so simple . ”
4993	4996	5015	5015	she	145	“ eternal womanly ”
5107	5122	5123	5123	She	145	“ I am sure I saw you in New York , at the opera ? ”
5154	5168	5134	5134	her	145	“ Yes , I was there . You were pointed out to me . ”
5169	5189	5134	5134	her	145	“ You were with some old friends of mine . I suppose they gave you an account of me ? ”
5190	5216	5217	5217	She	145	“ They were beginning it ; but then Melba began to sing , and some horrid people in the next box said ‘ Hush ! ’ ”
5236	5252	5227	5227	her	145	“ That is the worst of the opera ; it stops so much interesting conversation . ”
5253	5262	5227	5227	her	145	“ You do n't care for the music ? ”
5263	5271	5272	5272	she	145	“ Oh , I am a musician ! ”
5276	5300	5272	5272	she	145	“ I teach it . But I am like the mad King of Bavaria — I want an opera - house to myself . ”
5301	5306	5307	5307	he	140	“ You teach it ? ”
5329	5346	5325	5326	Captain Boyson	140	“ That 's the signal for closing . I think we ought to be moving up . ”
5393	5401	5408	5408	she	145	“ The holidays end to - morrow , ”
5531	5538	5539	5539	he	290	“ How charming your friend is ! ”
5564	5575	5543	5544	Cecilia Boyson	147	“ She tells me she is a teacher of music . ”
5978	5992	5994	5995	the curator	491	“ This , ladies , is the room in which General Washington died , ”
6003	6019	6020	6020	He	395	“ It is , of course , on that account sacred to every true American . ”
6792	6795	6783	6783	She	145	“ my pupils ”
6797	6801	6783	6783	She	145	“ my class , ”
6882	6908	6866	6867	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ She shut herself up here ? She lived in this garret ? That she might always see the tomb ? That is really true ? ”
6970	7010	6959	6959	he	491	“ Did Mrs. Verrier imply that no one who was not a fool could show her grief as Mrs. Washington did ? That it was , in fact , a sign of being a fool to regret your husband ? ”
7011	7017	7019	7020	Miss Floyd	145	“ Did she say that ? ”
7023	7033	7034	7034	They	578	“ Not like that , of course , but — ”
7081	7091	7068	7068	She	145	“ I suppose you know Mrs. Verrier 's story ? ”
7092	7115	7068	7068	She	145	“ Why , I never saw her before ! I hope I have n't said anything I ought n't to have said ? ”
7116	7122	7124	7124	Daphne	146	“ Everybody knows it here , ”
7127	7322	7323	7323	Barnes	121	“ Mrs. Verrier married three years ago . She married a Jew — a New Yorker — who had changed his name . You know Jews are not in what we call ‘ society ’ here . But Madeleine thought she could do it ; she was in love with him , and she meant to be able to do without society . But she could n't do without society ; and presently she began to dine out , and go to parties by herself — he urged her to . Then , after a bit , people did n't ask her as much as before ; she was n't happy ; and her people began to talk to him about a divorce — naturally they had been against her marrying him all along . He said — as they and she pleased . Then , one night about a year ago , he took the train to Niagara — of course it was a very commonplace thing to do — and two days afterwards he was found , thrown up by the whirlpool ; you know , where all the suicides are found ! ”
7336	7342	7343	7343	he	582	“ What a horrible story ! ”
7353	7364	7349	7350	Miss Floyd	145	“ Yes , poor Madeleine has never got over it . ”
7372	7388	7365	7367	The young man	290	“ Of course Mrs. Verrier herself had nothing to do with the talk about divorce ? ”
7412	7430	7401	7401	She	145	“ Why should n't she ? She was miserable . The marriage had been a great mistake . ”
7431	7439	7441	7442	the man	586	“ And you allow divorce for that ? ”
7446	7484	7441	7442	the man	586	“ Oh , of course I know every State is different , and some States are worse than others . But , somehow , I never came across a case like that — first hand — before . ”
7500	7513	7514	7514	she	317	“ I do n't know why you should talk in that way , ”
7527	7562	7514	7514	she	317	“ as though all our American views are wrong ! Each nation arranges these things for itself . You have the laws that suit you ; you must allow us those that suit us . ”
7576	7581	7582	7582	he	582	“ You say that ? ”
7585	7588	7582	7582	he	582	“ You ! ”
7589	7594	7567	7567	his	582	“ And why not ? ”
7595	7604	7605	7605	he	582	“ But — but you are so young ! ”
7617	7640	7567	7567	his	582	“ I beg your pardon — I ought not to talk about it at all . But it was so odd that — ”
7641	7652	7654	7655	Miss Floyd	145	“ That I knew anything about Mrs. Verrier 's affairs ? ”
7663	7688	7654	7655	Miss Floyd	145	“ Well , you see , American girls are not like English ones . We do n't pretend not to know what everybody knows . ”
7689	7693	7695	7695	Roger	121	“ Of course , ”
7698	7713	7695	7695	Roger	121	“ but you would n't think it a fair and square thing to do ? ”
7714	7718	7567	7567	his	582	“ Think what ? ”
7719	7743	7654	7655	Miss Floyd	145	“ Why , to marry a man , and then talk of divorcing him because people did n't invite you to their parties . ”
7744	7750	7752	7752	Daphne	145	“ She was very unhappy , ”
7755	7761	7763	7765	the young man	290	“ Well , by Jove ! ”
7767	7776	7763	7765	the young man	290	“ she does n't look very happy now ! ”
7777	7780	7781	7782	Miss Floyd	145	“ No , ”
7785	7801	7781	7782	Miss Floyd	145	“ No . There are many people who think she 'll never get over it . ”
7802	7810	7811	7812	The Apollo	589	“ Well , I give it up . ”
7818	7842	7814	7814	his	589	“ You say it was she who proposed to divorce him?—yet when the wretched man removes himself , then she breaks her heart ! ”
7843	7857	7859	7860	the girl	396	“ Naturally she did n't mean him to do it in that way , ”
7864	7872	7873	7873	she	396	“ Of course you misunderstood me entirely!—entirely ! ”
8005	8015	8016	8016	he	589	“ I am very sorry if I misunderstood you , ”
8025	8031	8016	8016	he	589	“ but I thought you — ”
8032	8071	8076	8076	her	396	“ You thought I sympathised with Mrs. Verrier ? So I do ; though of course I am awfully sorry that such a dreadful thing happened . But you 'll find , Mr. Barnes , that American girls — ”
8081	8126	8128	8133	the girl facing him—“make it tyranny	2770	“ Well , we know all about the old ideas , and we know also too well that there 's only one life , and we do n't mean to have that one spoilt . The old notions of marriage — your English notions , ”
8131	8183	8128	8133	the girl facing him—“make it tyranny	2770	him—“make it tyranny ! Why should people stay together when they see it 's a mistake ? We say everybody shall have their chance . And not one chance only , but more than one . People find out in marriage what they could n't find out before , and so — ”
8184	8198	8200	8200	Barnes	143	“ You let them chuck it just when they 're tired of it ? ”
8202	8208	8200	8200	Barnes	143	“ And what about the — ”
8209	8213	8215	8216	Miss Floyd	145	“ The children ? ”
8219	8248	8215	8216	Miss Floyd	145	“ Well , of course , that has to be very carefully considered . But how can it do children any good to live in an unhappy home ? ”
8249	8256	8200	8200	Barnes	143	“ Had Mrs. Verrier any children ? ”
8257	8264	8200	8200	Barnes	143	“ Yes , one little girl . ”
8265	8274	8215	8216	Miss Floyd	145	“ I suppose she meant to keep her ? ”
8275	8281	8200	8200	Barnes	143	“ Why , of course . ”
8282	8290	8200	8200	Barnes	143	“ And the father did n't care ? ”
8291	8299	8301	8301	Daphne	146	“ Well , I believe he did , ”
8305	8320	8301	8301	Daphne	146	“ Yes , that was very sad . He was quite devoted to her . ”
8321	8330	8331	8331	Barnes	143	“ And you think that 's all right ? ”
8339	8350	8351	8351	she	317	“ Well , of course , it was a pity , ”
8358	8382	8351	8351	she	317	“ I admit it was a pity . But then , why did she ever marry him ? That was the horrible mistake . ”
8383	8392	8331	8331	Barnes	143	“ I suppose she thought she liked him . ”
8393	8415	8351	8351	she	317	“ Oh , it was he who was so desperately in love with her . He plagued her into doing it . ”
8416	8420	8422	8422	Barnes	143	“ Poor devil ! ”
8425	8433	8422	8422	Barnes	143	“ All right , we 're coming . ”
9263	9265	9257	9257	She	141	“ character ”
9428	9442	9443	9443	she	145	“ You never heard of Miss Floyd?—of Daphne Floyd ? No ? Ah , well!”—and
9444	9480	9490	9491	General Hobson	120	laughed—“I suppose I ought to take it as a compliment , of a kind . There are so many rich people now in this queer country of ours that even Daphne Floyds do n't matter . ”
9481	9489	9490	9491	General Hobson	120	“ Is Miss Floyd so tremendously rich ? ”
9673	9685	9686	9686	he	289	“ And that poor child has the management of it all ? ”
9732	9737	9738	9738	she	147	“ Oh , yes ! ”
9746	9771	9738	9738	she	147	“ Everything is in her own hands — everything ! Mrs. Phillips would not dare to interfere . Daphne always has her own way . ”
10007	10011	10013	10013	Roger	121	“ Jolly weather ! ”
10019	10036	10013	10013	Roger	121	“ And a very nice afternoon . How long are you staying here , Uncle Archie ? ”
10037	10076	10077	10078	The General	289	“ I ought to be off at the end of the week ; and of course you want to get back to New York ? I say , you seemed to be getting on with that young lady ? ”
10088	10095	10097	10099	the young man	290	“ She was n't bad fun , ”
10102	10148	10097	10099	the young man	290	“ but rather an odd little thing ! We quarrelled about every conceivable subject . And it 's queer how much that kind of girl seems to go about in America . She goes everywhere and knows everything . I wonder how she manages it . ”
10149	10160	10162	10163	the General	289	“ What kind of girl do you suppose she is ? ”
10174	10182	10184	10184	Roger	121	“ She told me she taught singing , ”
10191	10201	10184	10184	Roger	121	“ to a class of girls in New York . ”
10206	10231	10202	10203	The General	289	“ She seems to have made a fool of you , my dear boy . She is one of the great heiresses of America . ”
10240	10270	10271	10272	The General	289	“ Oh ! that 's it , is it ? I thought once or twice there was something fishy — she was trying it on . Who told you ? ”
10409	10413	10400	10401	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ Good heavens ! ”
10454	10484	10450	10450	he	289	“ You know , Uncle Archie , if you 'd heard some of the things Miss Floyd was saying to me , your hair would have stood on end . ”
10491	10547	10488	10488	his	289	“ I dare say . I 'm too old - fashioned for America . The sooner I clear out the better . Their newspapers make me sick ; I hate the hotels — I hate the cooking ; and there is n't a nation in Europe I do n't feel myself more at home with . ”
10558	10623	10550	10550	his	289	“ Oh ! I do n't feel that way at all . I get on with them capitally . They 're a magnificent people . And , as to Miss Floyd , I did n't mean anything bad , of course . Only the ideas some of the girls here have , and the way they discuss them — well , it beats me ! ”
10624	10630	10631	10631	Roger	121	“ What sort of ideas ? ”
10642	10706	10631	10631	Roger	121	“ They do n't think anything 's settled , you know , as we do at home . Miss Floyd does n't . They think they 've got to settle a lot of things that English girls do n't trouble about because they 're just told to do 'em , or not to do 'em , by the people that look after them ! ”
10707	10719	10721	10722	the General	289	“ ‘ Everything hatched over again , and hatched different , ’ ”
10732	10763	10721	10722	the General	289	“ that 's what they 'd like , eh ? Pooh ! That 's when they 're young . They quiet down , like all the rest of the world . ”
10769	10803	10766	10766	his	289	“ But they are hatching it over again . You meet people here in society you could n't meet at home . And it 's all right . The law backs them up . ”
10804	10811	10813	10814	the General	289	“ You 're talking about divorce ! ”
10816	10905	10813	10814	the General	289	“ Aye ! it 's astounding ! The tales one hears in the smoking - room after dinner ! In Wyoming , apparently , six months ' residence , and there you are . You prove a little cruelty , the husband makes everything perfectly easy , you say a civil good - bye , and the thing 's done . Well , they 'll pay for it , my dear Roger — they'll pay for it . Nobody ever yet trifled with the marriage law with impunity . ”
10925	10951	10952	10952	They	704	“ Poor dear Uncle Archie ! If he 'd been a New Yorker he 'd never have put up with Aunt Lavinia for thirty years ! ”
11093	11521	11073	11073	she	153	“ Do n't suppose I put these things before you on my account . No , indeed ; what does it matter what happens to me ? It is when I think that you may have to spend your whole life as a clerk in a bank , unless you rouse yourself now—(for you know , my dear Roger , though you have very good wits , you 're not as frightfully clever as people have to be nowadays)—that I begin to despair . But that is entirely in your own hands . You have what is far more valuable than cleverness — you have a delightful disposition , and you are one of the handsomest of men . There ! of course , I know you would n't let me say it to you in your presence ; but it 's true all the same . Any girl should be proud to marry you . There are plenty of rich girls in America ; and if you play your cards properly you will make her and yourself happy . The grammar of that is not quite right , but you understand me . Find a nice girl — of course a nice girl — with a fortune large enough to put you back in your proper sphere ; and it does n't matter about me . You will pay my rent , I dare say , and help me through when I want it ; but that 's nothing . The point is , that I can not submit to your career being spoilt through your poor father 's mad imprudence . You must retrieve yourself — you must . Nobody is anything nowadays in the world without money ; you know that as well as I do . And besides , there is another reason . You have got to forget the affair of last spring , to put it entirely behind you , to show that horrid woman who threw you over that you will make your life a success in spite of her . Rouse yourself , my dear Roger , and do your best . I hope by now you have forwarded all my introductions ? You have your opportunity , and I must say you will be a great fool if you do n't use it . Do use it my dear boy , for my sake , I am a very unhappy woman ; but you might , if you would , bring back a little brightness to my life . ”
11616	11620	11615	11618	the “ horrid woman	2833	“ horrid woman . ”
11664	11674	11675	11675	he	710	“ I 'm not one of your sentimental sort , ”

12535	12545	12525	12525	She	146	“ So she bought it ! Daphne 's amazing ! ”
12646	12651	12653	12654	her friend	764	“ How like Daphne ! ”
12660	12662	12653	12654	her friend	764	“ simple ”

14026	14066	14067	14068	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ Dear Madeleine!—very good of you to wait . Have they given you tea ? I suppose not . My household seems to have gone mad this afternoon . Sit down . Some tea , Blount , at once . ”
14082	14085	14067	14068	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ Ouf ! ”
14130	14136	14138	14139	her companion	356	“ Where have you been ? ”
14142	14152	14154	14154	Daphne	146	“ Listening to a stuffy debate in the Senate , ”
14159	14170	14154	14154	Daphne	146	“ The Senate . What on earth took you there ? ”
14171	14224	14138	14139	her companion	356	“ Well , why should n't I go?—why does one do anything ? It was just a debate — horribly dull — trusts , or something , of that kind . But there was a man attacking the President — and the place was crowded . Ugh ! the heat was intolerable ! ”
14225	14230	14231	14231	Daphne	146	“ Who took you ? ”
14266	14287	14259	14260	Roger Barnes	121	“ I thought until I got your message that you were going to take Mr. Barnes motoring up the river . ”
14288	14294	14295	14295	Daphne	146	“ Mr. Barnes was engaged . ”
14314	14327	14329	14330	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ He seems to have been a good deal engaged this week , ”
14356	14364	14344	14345	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ I suppose it was the Bostonians ? ”
14365	14375	14344	14345	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ I suppose so . What does it matter ? ”
14383	14389	14391	14392	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ Daphne , you goose ! ”
14394	14464	14391	14392	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ I believe this is the very first invitation of theirs he has accepted at all . He was written to about them by an old friend — his Eton master , or somebody of that sort . And as they turned up here on a visit , instead of his having to go and look for them at Boston , of course he had to call upon them . ”
14465	14512	14530	14531	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ I dare say . And of course he had to go to tea with them yesterday , and he had to take them to Arlington this afternoon ! I suppose I 'd better tell you — we had a quarrel on the subject last night . ”
14513	14528	14530	14531	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ Daphne!—don't , for heaven 's sake , make him think himself too important ! ”

15430	15441	15424	15424	Daphne	146	“ I never know what to talk to him about . ”
15442	15448	15395	15395	she	396	“ As if that mattered ! ”
15449	15470	15471	15472	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ Elsie Maddison always knows what to talk to him about , and he chatters to her the whole time . ”
15480	15492	15471	15472	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ Do you suppose he came to America to marry money ? ”
15493	15500	15395	15395	she	396	“ I have n't an idea . ”
15501	15516	15517	15517	Daphne	146	“ Do you suppose he knows that you — are not exactly a pauper ? ”
15523	15548	15519	15519	herself	146	“ I really do n't suppose anything , Madeleine . He never talks about money , and I should think he had plenty himself . ”
15582	15613	15578	15578	Daphne	146	“ He ca n't be very poor or he would n't behave as he does . And he is to inherit the General 's property . He told me so . ”
15614	15637	15638	15638	Daphne	146	“ And it would n't matter to you , Daphne , if you did think a man had married you for money ? ”
15667	15703	15658	15658	She	146	“ It would matter a great deal , if I thought it had been only for money . But then , I hope I should n't have been such a fool as to marry him . ”
15704	15718	15658	15658	She	146	“ But you could bear it , if the money counted for something ? ”
15719	15726	15728	15731	the girl with energy	842	“ I 'm not an idiot ! ”
15733	15753	15728	15731	the girl with energy	842	“ With whom does n't money count for something ? Of course a man must take money into consideration . ”
15769	15790	15792	15793	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ ‘ How pleasant it is to have money , heigh - ho!—How pleasant it is to have money , ’ ”
15801	15839	15792	15793	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ Yes , I dare say you 'd be very reasonable , Daphne , about that kind of thing . But I do n't think you 'd be a comfortable wife , dear , all the same . ”
15840	15846	15728	15731	the girl with energy	842	“ What do you mean ? ”
15847	15876	15792	15793	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ You might allow your husband to spare a little love to your money ; you would be for killing him if he ever looked at another woman ! ”
15877	15885	15887	15887	Daphne	146	“ You mean I should be jealous ? ”
15893	15919	15887	15887	Daphne	146	“ You are quite right there . I should be very jealous . On that point I should ‘ find quarrel in a straw . ’ ”
15972	15989	15967	15967	her	159	“ Come here , little wild cat . I believe you are jealous of Elsie Maddison . ”
16025	16036	16037	16038	The girl	396	“ Daphne ! you are in love . with him ! ”
16047	16052	16053	16053	she	396	“ If I am , ”
16057	16083	16053	16053	she	396	“ it is strange how like the other thing it is ! I do n't know whether I shall speak to him to - night . ”
16084	16089	16090	16091	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ To - night ? ”
16097	16110	16090	16091	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ At the White House . You 're going , of course . ”
16111	16119	16090	16091	Mrs. Verrier	146	“ No , I am not going . ”
16127	16133	16134	16134	Daphne	146	“ I am not asked . ”
16147	16165	16134	16134	Daphne	146	“ It will be just a crush , dear . But I promised various people to go . ”
16166	16173	16134	16134	Daphne	146	“ And he will be there ? ”
16174	16179	16180	16180	Daphne	146	“ I suppose so . ”
16191	16198	16180	16180	Daphne	146	“ Have you seen the picture ? ”
16493	16499	16501	16502	Mrs. Phillips	142	“ But , my dear , ”
16515	16543	16507	16507	Daphne	146	“ you have taken the house on Lake George , and you know the girls had all set their hearts on that place in the White Mountains ! ”
16549	16560	16561	16561	she	146	“ Certainly I have taken the house on Lake George , ”
16571	16578	16561	16561	she	146	“ I told them I should . ”
16579	16611	16565	16565	she	146	“ But , my dear , they are so tired of Lake George ! They have been there three years running . And you know they subscribe a good deal themselves . ”
16612	16657	16658	16659	Mrs. Phillips	142	“ Very well!—then let them do without my help . I have inquired into the matter . The house on Lake George is much more suitable than the White Mountains farm , and I have written to the agent . The thing 's done . ”
16827	16837	16839	16840	Madeleine Verrier	159	“ I dare say the girls wo n't mind , ”
16909	16919	16921	16921	her	142	“ I must try and put it to them , ”
16925	16933	16934	16934	Madeleine	159	“ Daphne must always have her way , ”
16940	16951	16934	16934	Madeleine	159	“ I wonder what she 'll do when she marries . ”
16958	16997	16952	16953	Mrs. Phillips	142	“ I hope it 'll be the right man , Mrs. Verrier . Of course , with anyone so — so clever — and so used to managing everything for herself — one would be a little anxious . ”
17021	17031	17032	17032	she	146	“ Oh , well , nothing is irrevocable nowadays , ”
17039	17051	17032	17032	she	146	“ Still , I hope Daphne wo n't make a mistake . ”

18542	18553	18554	18554	he	289	“ I should be glad if you would tell me , ”
18561	18576	18554	18554	he	289	“ There are two or three people here to whom he should be introduced . ”

18782	18810	18766	18767	the General	289	“ He was . He is now just a writer of books . But Elsie was brought up in Cambridge . How did Mr. Roger know them ? ”

19199	19229	19230	19231	The General	289	“ Yes ; it 's a feature of our modern life — the life of our women . But not the most significant one , by a long way . ”
19250	19261	19240	19241	The journalist	994	“ The most significant thing in American life just now — ”

19651	19680	19640	19641	General Hobson	120	“ I do n't wish to seem an intrusive person , my dear Roger , but may I ask how much longer you mean to stay in Washington ? ”
19719	19750	19696	19696	Roger	121	“ And as for you , Uncle Archie , I thought you meant to sail a fortnight ago . If you 've been staying on like this on my account — ”
19751	19765	19767	19768	the General	289	“ Do n't make a fool either of me or yourself , Roger ! ”
19783	19822	19767	19768	the General	289	“ Of course it was on your account that I have stayed on . But what on earth it all means , and where your affairs are — I'm hanged if I have the glimmer of an idea ! ”

19920	20017	19917	19917	Roger	121	“ Given me?—given everybody reason?—of course you have!—a dozen times over . I do n't like interfering with your affairs , Roger — with any young man 's affairs — but you must know that you have set Washington talking , and it 's not fair to a girl — by George it isn't!—when she has given you encouragement and you have made her conspicuous , to begin the same story , in the same place , immediately , with someone else ! As you say , I ought to have taken myself off long ago . ”
20018	20028	20030	20030	Roger	121	“ I did n't say anything of the kind , ”
20033	20094	20030	20030	Roger	121	“ you should n't put words into my mouth , Uncle Archie . And I really do n't see why you attack me like this . My tutor particularly asked me , if I came across them , to be civil to Mrs. Maddison and her daughter , and I have done nothing but pay them the most ordinary attentions . ”
20095	20118	20119	20120	The General	289	“ When a man is in love he pays no ordinary attentions . He has eyes for no one but the lady . ”
20146	20212	20030	20030	Roger	121	“ However , it is no good talking , and I do n't exactly know why I should put my old oar in . But the fact is I feel a certain responsibility . People here have been uncommonly civil . Well , well!—I've wired to - day to ask if there is a berth left in the Venetia for Saturday . And you , I suppose”—the

20259	20301	20256	20256	Roger	121	“ I really think that 's my business . However , you 've been an awful brick , Uncle Archie , to stay on like this . I assure you , if I do n't say much , I think it . ”
20322	20331	20320	20320	people	2726	“ That 's how you put me off . ”
20339	20359	20320	20320	people	2726	“ And you wo n't give me any idea of the line I am to take with your mother ? ”
20371	20385	20360	20362	The young man	290	“ If you 'll only be patient a little longer , Uncle Archie — ”

22367	22401	22402	22402	Roger	121	“ What right have you to stalk me , as you call it?—to follow me — to speak to me even ? I wish to avoid you — and I have shown it ! ”
22435	22443	22417	22417	him	1008	“ And why have you shown it ? ”
22455	22495	22452	22452	his	1008	“ What have I done ? I have n't deserved it ! You treat me like — like a friend — and then you drop me — like a hot coal ! You 've been awfully unkind to me ! ”
22496	22505	22506	22506	she	145	“ I wo n't discuss it with you , ”
22510	22528	22506	22506	she	145	“ You are in my way , Mr. Barnes . Let me go back to the others ! ”
22620	22705	22605	22605	Roger	121	“ Daphne , I 'm a ruffian ! Forgive me ! you must , Daphne ! Look here , I want you to marry me . I 've nothing to offer you , of course ; I 'm a poor man , and you 've all this horrible money ! But I — I love you!—and I 'll make you a good husband , Daphne , that I 'll swear . If you 'll take me , you shall never be sorry for it . ”
22748	22758	22737	22737	she	1110	“ Go and tell all that to Elsie Maddison ! ”
22770	22812	22737	22737	she	1110	“ She 'd soon send me about my business ! I should be a day too late for the fair , in that quarter . What do you think she and I have been talking about all this time , Daphne ? ”
22813	22819	22821	22821	Daphne	145	“ I do n't care ! ”
22829	22841	22843	22843	Roger	121	“ I 'm going to tell you , all the same , ”

22922	22984	22914	22916	the young man	290	“ And she 's talked about nothing all the time , nothing at all — but old Herbert — and how good he is — and how good - looking , and the Lord knows what ! I got precious sick of it , though I think he 's a trump , too . Oh , Daphne!—you were a little fool ! ”
22985	22995	22996	22996	Daphne	145	“ All the same , you have behaved abominably ! ”
23002	23009	23011	23011	Roger	121	“ No , I have n't , ”

23969	24053	23951	23951	she	153	“ the trouble is that Daphne is never satisfied . She has some impossible ideal in her mind , and then everything must be sacrificed to it . She began with going into ecstasies over this dear old house , and now!—there 's scarcely a thing in it she does not want to change . Poor Edward and I spent thousands upon it , and we really flattered ourselves that we had some taste ; but it is not good enough for Daphne ! ”

24140	24164	24129	24130	Lady Barnes	153	“ I do n't , of course , like to say it — but really Daphne 's self - confidence is too amazing ! ”
24165	24172	24174	24175	Elsie French	124	“ She does know so much , ”

24184	24235	24129	24130	Lady Barnes	153	“ Well , if you call it knowing . She can always get some tiresome person , whom she calls an ‘ expert , ’ to back her up . But I believe in liking what you do like , and not being bullied into what you do n't like ! ”
24236	24245	24246	24247	Elsie French	124	“ I suppose if one studies these things — ”
24251	24259	24261	24262	Lady Barnes	153	“ What 's the good of studying ! ”

She does n't trouble to argue ; she begins to laugh , and raises her eyebrows . I — I always feel as if she had struck me in the face ! I know I ought n't to speak like this ; I had n't meant to do it , especially to a country - woman of hers , as you are . ”
25156	25160	25162	25162	Elsie	124	“ Am I ? ”
25177	25179	25169	25170	Lady Barnes	153	“ I meant”—the
25182	25206	25041	25041	she	797	hurried—“I thought — Mrs. Barnes was a South American ? Her mother was Spanish , of course ; you see it in Daphne . ”

25221	25250	25217	25218	Mrs. French	190	“ and her grace — isn't she graceful ! My husband says she moves like a sea - wave . She has given her eyes to the child . ”

26047	26197	26021	26022	Mrs. French	190	“ It 's my son I am thinking of , Mrs. French . I know you 're safe , and that Roger depends upon Mr. French more than upon anyone else in the world , so I ca n't help just saying a word to you about my anxiety . You know , when Roger married , I do n't think he was much in love — in fact , I 'm sure he was n't . But now — it 's quite different . Roger has a very soft heart , and he 's very domestic . He was always the best of sons to me , and as soon as he was married he became the best of husbands . He 's devoted to Daphne now , and you see how he adores the child . But the fact is , there 's a person in this neighbourhood ”
26207	26236	26202	26202	her	153	her)—“I only knew it for certain this morning - who ... well , who might make trouble . And Daphne 's temper is so passionate and uncontrolled that — ”
26237	26250	26202	26202	her	153	“ Dear Lady Barnes , please do n't tell me any secrets ! ”
26364	26368	26370	26370	Elsie	124	“ Dr. Lelius ! ”
26375	26381	26370	26370	Elsie	124	“ Was Daphne expecting him ? ”

26430	26434	26436	26437	Lady Barnes	153	“ Another expert ! ”
26564	26676	26555	26555	Daphne	145	“ One can not really live with bad pictures because they happen to be one 's ancestors ! We wo n't do them any harm , mamma ! of course not . There is a room upstairs where they can be stored — most carefully — and anybody who is interested in them can go and look at them . If they had only been left as they were painted!—not by Lely , of course , but by some drapery man in his studio — passe encore ! they might have been just bearable . But you see some wretched restorer went and daubed them all over a few years ago . ”
26677	26694	26696	26697	Lady Barnes	153	“ We went to the best man we could find ! We took the best advice ! ”
26721	26755	26756	26756	Daphne	145	“ I 'm sure you did . But then , you see , nobody knew anything at all about it in those days . The restorers were all murderers . Ask Dr. Lelius . ”
26798	26805	26806	26806	he	1215	“ It is a modern art , ”
26815	26828	26806	26806	he	1215	slight—“a quite modern art . We hafe a great man at Würzburg . ”
26829	26846	26848	26849	Lady Barnes	153	“ I do n't suppose he professes to know anything about English pictures , does he ? ”
26853	26875	26848	26849	Lady Barnes	153	“ Ach!—I do not propose that Mrs. Barnes entrust him wid dese pictures , Madame . It is now too late . ”
26958	26973	26974	26974	she	153	“ All the same , they are my forbears , my kith and kin , ”
26980	26999	26974	26974	she	153	“ But of course Mrs. Barnes is mistress here : I suppose she will do as she pleases . ”
27220	27227	27228	27228	He	1222	“ Hullo ! any tea going ? ”
27255	27263	27264	27264	he	1222	“ Still bothering about those beastly pictures ? ”

27287	27297	27298	27298	He	1222	“ I did n't mean any harm , mother . ”
27309	27348	27298	27298	He	1222	“ I say , Daphne , I 've got an idea . Why should n't mother have them ? She 's going to take a house , she says . Let 's hand them all over to her ! ”
27357	27372	27349	27350	Lady Barnes	153	“ The Trescoes who were born and died in this house , belong here ! ”
27388	27398	27349	27350	Lady Barnes	153	“ It would be a sacrilege to move them . ”
27399	27408	27411	27411	Daphne	145	“ Well then , let 's move ourselves ! ”
27416	27430	27411	27411	Daphne	145	“ We can let this house again , ca n't we , Roger ? ”
27431	27438	27440	27440	Roger	121	“ We can , I suppose , ”
27448	27456	27440	27440	Roger	121	“ but we 're not going to . ”

27913	27979	27908	27908	her	1250	“ I am afraid , Mrs. Barnes , I am disturbing you all . The butler told me you had only been here a few days . But Lady Barnes and your husband are such old friends of mine that , as soon as I heard — through our old postmistress , I think — that you had arrived , I thought I might venture . ”
28056	28067	28068	28068	he	778	“ I had no idea you were in these parts , ”
28127	28141	28143	28146	the new - comer	1250	“ Oh , I am staying a day or two with Duchess Mary , ”
28148	28195	28143	28146	the new - comer	1250	“ She is a little older — and no less gouty , poor dear , than she used to be . Mrs. Barnes , I have heard a great deal of you — though you may n't know anything about me , Ah ! Dr. Lelius ? ”
28215	28234	28235	28235	she	1258	“ They did nothing but talk about you at the Louvre , when I was there last week , ”
28244	28267	28268	28268	She	1258	“ You have made them horribly uncomfortable about some of their things . Is n't it a pity to know too much ? ”
28273	28283	28284	28284	She	145	“ I 'm afraid that 's your case too . ”
28332	28339	28341	28341	Daphne	145	“ Do you mean about pictures ? ”
28347	28358	28341	28341	Daphne	145	“ I do n't know as much as Dr. Lelius . ”
28374	28405	28369	28370	Mrs. Fairmile	203	“ That 's not given to the rest of us mortals . But after all , having 's better than knowing . Don't — don't you possess the Vitali Signorelli ? ”
28421	28443	28414	28414	Daphne	145	“ Yes , we do . It 's in London now — waiting till we can find a place for it . ”
28444	28490	28406	28406	Her	1258	“ You must let me make a pilgrimage — when it comes . But you know you 'd find a number of things at Upcott — where I 'm staying now — that would interest you . I forget whether you 've met the Duchess ? ”
28491	28499	28501	28501	Roger	121	“ This is our first week here , ”
28505	28526	28501	28501	Roger	121	“ The house has been let till now . We came down to see what could be made of it . ”
28559	28565	28566	28566	she	335	“ Ah ! the Lelys ! ”
28582	28600	28566	28566	she	335	“ The dear impossible things ! Are you still discussing them — as we used to do ? ”
28604	28612	28601	28601	Daphne	145	“ You know this house , then ? ”
28631	28646	28623	28624	Mrs. Fairmile	203	“ Do n't I , dear Lady Barnes — don't I know this house ? ”
28656	28668	28669	28669	she	153	“ Well , you were here often enough to know it , ”
28673	28685	28669	28669	she	153	“ Daphne , Mrs. Fairmile is a distant cousin of ours . ”
28686	28696	28698	28699	the visitor	735	“ Distant , but quite enough to swear by ! ”
28703	28725	28726	28726	She	153	“ Yes , Mrs. Barnes , I knew this house very well in old days . It has many charming points . ”
29155	29168	29169	29170	Mrs. Fairmile	203	“ Well , now , when will you all come to Upcott ? ”

29194	29207	29252	29253	Mrs. Fairmile	203	“ Thank you ! but we really ca n't come so far , ”
29213	29242	29252	29253	Mrs. Fairmile	203	“ We have only a shaky old motor — our new one is n't ready yet — and besides , we want all our time for the house . ”
29243	29251	29252	29253	Mrs. Fairmile	203	“ You make him work so hard ? ”
29273	29280	29281	29281	she	145	“ Roger has nothing to do , ”
29286	29312	29281	29281	she	145	“ Thank you very much : we will certainly come . I 'll write to you . How many miles did you say it was ? ”
29313	29337	29338	29347	The speaker , who was just passing through the door	1277	“ Oh , nothing for a motor!—twenty - five . We used to think it nothing for a ride , did n't we ? ”

29698	29704	29713	29713	He	1288	“ a happy English child , ”
29804	29807	29793	29793	he	1288	“ bright . ”
29824	29827	29815	29815	he	1288	“ quaint . ”
29891	29895	29890	29890	them	1302	“ my lord . ”
30086	30088	30082	30082	he	586	“ My dear!”—his
30091	30099	30100	30102	The two ladies	1317	hastily—“We must not detain Mrs. Barnes longer ! ”
30164	30173	30175	30176	Lady Barnes	153	“ Daphne!—my dear ! what is the matter ? ”
30181	30191	30193	30193	Daphne	145	“ He spoke to me impertinently about my country ! ”
30210	30218	30199	30199	her	145	“ The Archdeacon!—he is always so polite . ”
30219	30233	30241	30241	she	145	“ He talked like a fool — about things he does n't understand ! ”
30256	30280	30241	30241	she	145	“ About what ? My dear Daphne ! He could not possibly have meant to offend you ! Could he , Mr. French ? ”
30295	30339	30341	30341	Daphne	145	“ If he chooses to think America immoral and degraded because American divorce laws are different from the English laws , let him think it!—but he has no business to air his views to an American — at a first visit , too ! ”
30362	30369	30371	30372	Lady Barnes	153	“ Oh dear ! oh dear ! ”
30374	30397	30371	30372	Lady Barnes	153	“ And the Archdeacon is so important ! Daphne might have been rude to anybody else — but not to the Archdeacon ! ”
30398	30413	30415	30415	Elsie	124	“ How did they manage to get into such a subject — so quickly ? ”
30419	30438	30415	30415	Elsie	124	“ I suppose he took it for granted that Daphne agreed with him ! All decent people do . ”
30881	30888	30868	30868	He	778	“ Are you tired , Daphne ? ”
30889	30892	30868	30868	He	778	“ No . ”
30893	30902	30903	30903	He	778	“ A penny for your thoughts , then ! ”
30926	30934	30935	30935	he	778	“ What 's the matter with you ? ”
30941	30946	30948	30948	Daphne	145	“ I 'm wondering , ”
30951	30986	30948	30948	Daphne	145	“ how many more cousins and great friends you have , that I know nothing about . I think another time it would be civil — just that!—to give me a word of warning . ”
30993	31029	30987	30987	Roger	121	“ I had n't an idea she was within a thousand miles of this place ! But , if I had , I could n't have imagined she would have the face to come here ! ”
31030	31035	30948	30948	Daphne	145	“ Who is she ? ”
31047	31060	31062	31063	the man	586	“ Well , there 's no good making any bones about it , ”
31067	31084	31085	31085	he	778	“ She 's a girl I was once engaged to — for a very short time , ”
31089	31114	31085	31085	he	778	“ It was the week before my father died , and our smash came . As soon as it came she threw me over . ”
31129	31138	31115	31115	Daphne	145	“ How long were you engaged to her ? ”
31139	31143	31085	31085	he	778	“ Three weeks . ”
31144	31153	31085	31085	he	778	“ Had she been staying here before that ? ”
31154	31190	31115	31115	Daphne	145	“ Yes — she often stayed here . Daphne ! do n't look like that ! She treated me abominably ; and before I married you I had come not to care twopence about her . ”
31191	31203	31085	31085	he	778	“ You did care about her when you proposed to me ? ”
31204	31230	31085	31085	he	778	“ No!—not at all ! Of course , when I went out to New York I was sore , because she had thrown me over . ”
31231	31233	31115	31115	Daphne	145	“ And I”—Daphne
31237	31264	31085	31085	he	778	lip—“was the feather - bed to catch you as you fell . It never occurred to you that it might have been honourable to tell me ? ”
31265	31284	31285	31285	Roger	121	“ Well , I do n't know — I never asked you to tell me of your affairs ! ”
31302	31308	31285	31285	Roger	121	“ I told you everything ! ”
31312	31314	31315	31315	Roger	121	reply—“everything . ”
31458	31462	31439	31439	Chloe	207	“ a bit upset ”
31556	31562	31563	31563	he	1352	“ Look here , dear ! ”
31571	31631	31563	31563	he	1352	wife—“don't you get any nonsense into your head . I 'm not the kind of fellow who goes philandering after a woman when she 's jilted him . I took her measure , and after you accepted me I never gave her another thought . I forgot her , dear — bag and baggage ! Kiss me , Daphne ! ”
31640	31649	31650	31650	she	145	“ How long were you engaged to her ? ”
31653	31662	31664	31665	the man	586	“ I 've told you — three weeks ! ”
31669	31677	31664	31665	the man	586	“ How long had you known her ? ”
31678	31780	31781	31781	Roger	121	“ A year or two . She was a distant cousin of father 's . Her father was Governor of Madras , and her mother was dead . She could n't stand India for long together , and she used to stay about with relations . Why she took a fancy to me I ca n't imagine . She 's so booky and artistic , and that kind of thing , that I never understood half the time what she was talking about . Now you 're just as clever , you know , darling , but I do understand you . ”
31850	31856	31858	31858	Daphne	145	“ Whom did she marry ? ”
31867	31943	31858	31858	Daphne	145	“ A fellow in the army — Major Fairmile — a smart , popular sort of chap . He was her father 's aide - de - camp when they married — just after we did — and they 've been in India , or Egypt , ever since . They do n't get on , and I suppose she comes and quarters herself on the old Duchess — as she used to on us . ”
31944	31980	31982	31982	Daphne	145	“ You seem to know all about her ! Yes , I remember now , I 've heard people speak of her to you . Mrs. Fairmile — Mrs. Fairmile — yes , I remember , ”
31996	32013	31982	31982	Daphne	145	“ Your uncle — in town — mentioned her . I did n't take any notice . ”
32014	32033	31858	31858	Daphne	145	“ Why should you ? She does n't matter a fig , either to you or to me ! ”
32034	32062	32064	32064	Daphne	145	“ It matters to me very much that these people who spoke of her — your uncle and the others — knew what I did n't know ! ”
32273	32281	32282	32282	he	1360	“ Well , some of them knew , ”
32290	32361	32282	32282	he	1360	“ And they knew that I was jolly well quit of her ! I suppose I ought to have told you , Daphne — of course I ought — I'm sorry . But the fact was I never wanted to think of her again . And I certainly never want to see her again ! Why , in the name of goodness , did you accept that tea - fight ? ”
32362	32369	32444	32444	her	145	“ Because I mean to go . ”
32370	32380	32444	32444	her	145	“ Then you 'll have to go without me , ”
32386	32410	32411	32411	Daphne	145	“ Oh , so you 're afraid of meeting her ! I shall know what to think , if you do n't go . ”
32452	32521	32446	32446	he	1362	“ Look here , Daphne , do n't let us quarrel about this . I 'll tell you everything you want to know — the whole beastly story . But it ca n't be pleasant to me to meet a woman who treated me as she did — and it ought n't to be pleasant to you either . It was like her audacity to come this afternoon . ”
32522	32533	32534	32534	Daphne	145	“ She simply wants to get hold of you again ! ”
32549	32583	32538	32538	she	145	“ Nonsense ! she came out of nothing in the world but curiosity , and because she likes making people uncomfortable . She knew very well mother and I did n't want her ! ”
32711	32718	32719	32719	she	145	“ I suppose you kissed her ? ”
32756	32762	32753	32753	she	145	“ You did kiss her ? ”
32763	32778	32747	32747	his	1363	“ Well , of course I did ! What else is one engaged for ? ”
32779	32792	32794	32794	Daphne	145	“ I 'm certain she wished for a great deal of kissing ! ”
32851	32854	32829	32832	a wholly unwilling self	1368	“ muddy vesture ”
32950	32984	32945	32945	he	1363	“ Look here , Daphne ! I wish you 'd let that woman alone ! Have I ever looked at anyone but you , old girl , since that day at Mount Vernon ? ”
33003	33011	33039	33039	She	145	“ little mice stole in and out . ”
33369	33377	33383	33383	he	1377	“ hint a fault and hesitate dislike . ”

33522	33532	33533	33533	he	187	“ Stand for the County Council , old fellow , ”
33536	33552	33533	33533	he	187	“ Your father was on it , and it 'll give you something to do . ”
33654	33660	33661	33661	Roger	121	“ I do n't mind , ”
33665	33692	33661	33661	Roger	121	“ if you think they 'd have me . Beastly bore , of course ! But one 's got to do something for one 's keep . ”
33740	33750	33752	33752	French	187	“ Oh ! you 'll find it quite tolerable , ”
33754	33779	33752	33752	French	187	“ Roads and schools do as well as anything else to break one 's teeth on . We shall see you a magistrate directly . ”
33783	33804	33780	33780	Roger	121	“ That would be a good one!—I say , you know , I hope Daphne 's going to like Heston . ”
33812	33823	33824	33824	He	1377	“ I hear the Archdeacon got on her nerves yesterday ? ”
33837	33843	33824	33824	He	1377	“ That does n't matter . ”
33844	33936	33780	33780	Roger	121	“ I do n't know . He 's rather a spiteful old party . And Daphne 's accustomed to be made a lot of , you know . In London there 's always a heap of people making up to her — and in Paris , too . She talks uncommon good French — learnt it in the convent . I do n't understand a word of what they talk about — but she 's a queen — I can tell you ! She does n't want Archdeacons prating at her . ”
33937	33949	33824	33824	He	1377	“ It 'll be all right when she knows the people . ”
33950	34009	33824	33824	He	1377	“ Of course , mother and I get along here all right . We 've got to pick up the threads again ; but we do know all the people , and we like the old place for grandfather 's sake , and all the rest of it . But there is n't much to amuse Daphne here . ”
34010	34019	33780	33780	Roger	121	“ She 'll be doing up the house . ”
34020	34075	34076	34076	Roger	121	“ And offending mother all the time . I say , French , do n't you think art 's an awful nuisance ! When I hear Lelius yarning on about quattro - cento and cinque - cento , I could drown myself . No ! I suppose you 're tarred with the same brush . ”
34081	34105	34076	34076	Roger	121	“ Well , I do n't care , so long as Daphne gets what she wants , and the place suits the child . ”

34414	34438	34439	34439	He	1398	“ Daphne would like a boy — so should I , and particularly now that we 've got the old house back again . ”
34641	34660	34661	34661	he	1398	“ My dear fellow , I hope Mrs. Barnes will give you not one son , but many ! ”
34672	34678	34661	34661	he	1398	“ They 're wanted nowadays . ”
34793	34801	34803	34803	French	187	“ If only the wife plays up ! ”
34818	34836	34838	34838	Roger	121	“ Daphne , you know , wo n't be able to stand this all the year round , ”
34840	34855	34838	34838	Roger	121	“ By George , no ! not with a waggon - load of Leliuses ! ”
34866	34900	34838	34838	Roger	121	“ I say , French , do you know what sort of state the Fairmile marriage is in by now ? I think that lady might have spared her call — don't you ? ”
34966	34969	34970	34970	French	187	“ jilting . ”
35032	35064	35065	35065	Roger	121	“ Faults on both sides , of course . Fairmile is and always was an unscrupulous beggar ! He left Eton just as you came , but I remember him well . ”
35286	35308	35273	35273	He	187	“ She 's just the wife for old Herbert — and , by George , she 's in love with him ! ”
35309	35320	35322	35322	Daphne	145	“ A great deal too much in love with him ! ”
35387	35390	35385	35385	Daphne	145	“ simplicity , ”
35513	35523	35478	35478	Daphne	145	“ I say ! Herbert never gives himself airs ! ”
35524	35616	35478	35478	Daphne	145	“ They both did — to me . They have quite different ways from us , and they make one feel it . They have family prayers — we do n't . They have ascetic ideas about bringing up children — I have n't . Elsie would think it self - indulgent and abominable to stay in bed to breakfast — I do n't . The fact is , all her interests and ideals are quite different from mine , and I am rather tired of being made to feel inferior . ”
35617	35654	35478	35478	Daphne	145	“ Daphne ! what rubbish ! I 'm certain Elsie French never had such an idea in her head . She 's awfully soft and nice ; I never saw a bit of conceit in her . ”
35655	35686	35688	35688	Daphne	145	“ She 's soft outside and steel inside . Well , never mind ! we do n't get on . She 's the old America , I 'm the new , ”
35696	35705	35688	35688	Daphne	145	“ and I 'm as good as she . ”
35706	35718	35720	35720	Roger	121	“ You 're a very good - looking woman , anyway , ”
35738	35749	35750	35750	He	1432	“ Much better - looking than when I married you . ”
35803	35824	35825	35825	she	145	“ That means that you did n't think me good - looking at all , as compared with — Chloe ? ”
35829	35832	35825	35825	she	145	“ Really , Daphne!”—Roger
35840	35863	35825	35825	she	145	laugh—“the way you twist what one says ! I declare I wo n't make you any more pretty speeches for an age . ”
36308	36316	36317	36317	Daphne	145	“ And how do you like England ? ”
36323	36326	36327	36327	she	145	“ Moderately ! ”
36385	36389	36390	36391	The speaker	542	“ Only moderately ? ”
36405	36419	36390	36391	The speaker	542	“ I 'm extremely sorry we do n't please you , Mrs. Barnes . ”
36420	36430	36390	36391	The speaker	542	“ You see , my expectations were so high . ”
36431	36450	36452	36453	the Duchess	3006	“ Is it the country , or the climate , or the people , that wo n't do ? ”
36457	36469	36471	36471	Daphne	145	“ I suppose it would be civil to say the climate , ”

36834	36865	36786	36786	she	145	“ how clever of you ! But that 's not a Fragonard . I wish it were . It 's an unknown . Dr. Lelius has given him a name . ”
37092	37146	37085	37089	The mistress of the house	1489	“ Chloe ! who do you think has called ? Old Marcus , of South Audley Street . He 's been at Brendon House — buying up their Romneys , I should think . And as he was passing here , he wished to show me something . Shall we have him in ? ”
37147	37169	37171	37171	Chloe	208	“ By all means ! The last time he was here he offered you four thousand pounds for the blue Nattier , ”
37339	37342	37343	37343	he	218	“ There ! ”
37359	37390	37391	37391	He	218	“ Your Grace asked me — oh ! ten years ago — and again last year — to find you the pair of that . Now — you have it ! ”
37423	37431	37418	37418	she	3006	“ Marcus , I have no money . ”
37432	37435	37436	37436	He	218	“ Oh ! ”
37445	37458	37436	37436	He	218	“ And I know you want a brigand 's price for it . ”
37459	37468	37469	37470	The Duchess	3006	“ Oh , nothing — nothing at all . ”
37483	37489	37490	37490	she	3006	“ A thousand , Marcus ? ”
37504	37538	37539	37539	He	218	“ That means more , Marcus : how do you imagine that an old woman like me , with only just enough for bread and butter , can waste her money on Sèvres ? ”
37548	37599	37542	37542	She	3006	“ No ! I 've got a consumptive nephew with a consumptive family . He ought to have been hung for marrying , but I 've got to send them all to Davos this winter . No , I ca n't , Marcus ; I can't — I'm too poor . ”
37612	37637	37608	37608	Daphne	145	“ If the Duchess has really made up her mind , Mr. Marcus , I will take it . It would just suit me ! ”
37644	37649	37650	37650	he	220	“ Pardon , Madame ! ”
37674	37687	37689	37689	Daphne	145	“ We have the motor . We can take it with us , ”

37721	37728	37730	37730	Daphne	145	“ The price does n't matter , ”
37734	37756	37730	37730	Daphne	145	“ You know me quite well , Mr. Marcus . Do you remember selling a Louis Seize cabinet to Miss Floyd ? ”

37995	38014	38015	38015	Daphne	145	“ It was n't quite nice , was it , outbidding her like that in her own house ? ”

38524	38533	38534	38535	Chloe Fairmile	208	“ I am . Look at the day ! ”
38615	38643	38609	38609	she	3006	“ You always look well , my dear , in a habit , and you know it . Tell me what I shall do with this invitation . ”
38644	38653	38654	38654	Chloe	208	“ From Lady Warton ? May I look ? ”
38668	38675	38677	38678	the Duchess	3006	“ What were her governesses about ? ”
38684	38696	38677	38678	the Duchess	3006	“ Really — the education of our class ! Read it ! ”
38698	39132	38654	38654	Chloe	208	“ Can I persuade you to come — and bring Mrs. Fairmile — next Tuesday to dinner , to meet Roger Barnes and his wife ? I groan at the thought , for I think she is quite one of the most disagreeable little creatures I ever saw . But Warton says I must — a Lord - Lieutenant ca n't pick and choose!—and people as rich as they are have to be considered . I ca n't imagine why it is she makes herself so odious . All the Americans I ever knew I have liked particularly . It is , of course , annoying that they have so much money — but Warton says it is n't their fault — it 's Protection , or something of the kind . But Mrs. Barnes seems really to wish to trample on us . She told Warton the other day that his tapestries — you know , those we 're so proud of — that they were bad Flemish copies of something or other — a set belonging to a horrid friend of hers , I think . Warton was furious . And she 's made the people at Brendon love her for ever by insisting that they have now ruined all their pictures without exception , by the way they 've had them restored — et cetera , et cetera . She really makes us feel her millions — and her brains — too much . We 're paupers , but we 're not worms . Then there 's the Archdeacon — why should she fall foul of him ? He tells Warton that her principles are really shocking . She told him she saw no reason why people should stick to their husbands or wives longer than it pleased them — and that in America nobody did ! He does n't wish Mrs. Mountford to see much of her ; — though , really , my dear , I do n't think Mrs. M. is likely to give him trouble — do you ? And I hear , of course , that she thinks us all dull and stuck - up , and as ignorant as savages . It 's so odd she should n't even want to be liked!—a young woman in a strange neighbourhood . But she evidently does n't , a bit . Warton declares she 's already tired of Roger — and she 's certainly not nice to him . What can be the matter ? Anyway , dear Duchess , do come and help us through . ”
39133	39143	39149	39149	she	208	“ What , indeed , can be the matter ? ”
39155	39176	39178	39179	the Duchess	3006	“ Angela Warton never knows anything . But there 's not much need for you to ask , my dear , ”
39189	39192	39182	39183	Mrs. Fairmile	203	“ Me ? ”
39222	39228	39230	39230	Chloe	208	“ What can you mean ? ”
39241	39256	39237	39237	her	208	“ I ca n't imagine . And I do n't think I 'll try . ”
39525	39553	39489	39489	Daphne	145	“ She wishes to keep us under observation — to give us opportunities — and then torment her husband . Very well then!—tu l'as voulu , Madame ! ”
39557	39560	39561	39561	Chloe	208	“ opportunities , ”
39702	39725	39695	39695	Roger	121	“ though he is a model husband , far better than she deserves , and anybody not a fool could manage him . ”
40313	40329	40330	40330	Whereupon	186	“ I must speak to you . Something that concerns another person — something urgent . ”
40362	40390	40330	40330	Whereupon	186	them—“Of course , I see — you have n't forgiven me ! Never mind ! I am doing this for someone else — it 's a duty . ”

40435	40468	40429	40429	her	3006	“ Oh yes , you have . I do n't make mistakes about such things . Do you remember the letter in which I told you about that affair of Theresa Weightman ? ”
40478	40515	40429	40429	her	3006	“ Well , she 's in great trouble . Her husband threatens absurdities . She has always confided in me — she trusts me , and I ca n't have that letter wandering about the world . ”
40516	40523	40427	40427	She	3006	“ I certainly sent it back ! ”
40524	40574	40429	40429	her	3006	“ No — you never sent it back . You have three of mine . And you know how careless you are — how you leave things about . I was always on tenterhooks . Look again , please ! You must have some idea where they might be . ”
40579	40606	40429	40429	her	3006	“ When we sold the London house , all papers and documents were sent down here . We reserved a room — which was locked up . ”
40607	40620	40427	40427	She	3006	“ À la bonne heure ! Of course — there they are . ”
40693	40727	40654	40654	he	1592	“ But I must have them — I really must ! It is a horrid tragedy , and I told you everything — things I had no business to tell you at all . ”

41224	41239	41220	41220	he	1613	“ Twelve miles , is n't it ? You 're not going to hunt ? ”
41240	41285	41286	41286	Roger	121	“ Oh , no ! I only came to look at the hounds and the horses — to remind myself of all the good old times . You do n't want to remember them , I know . Life 's gone on for you ! ”
41297	41306	41307	41307	he	1613	“ It goes on for all of us , ”

41627	41666	41605	41605	he	1613	“ I 'm sure I do n't know ; I never thought about it — whether it was pretty or ugly , I mean . It suited us , and it amused mother to fiddle about with it . ”
41673	41684	41685	41685	she	203	“ Of course a great deal of it was ugly , ”
41689	41713	41685	41685	she	203	“ Dear Lady Barnes really did n't know . But then we led such a jolly life in it — we made it ! ”
41737	41755	41731	41731	He	1613	“ I 'm glad you think it was jolly . My remembrances are not quite so pleasant . ”
41773	41894	41895	41895	She	208	“ Oh , yes , they are — or should be . What 's the use of blackening the past because it could n't be the present ? My dear Roger , if I hadn't — well , let 's talk plainly!—if I had n't thrown you over , where would you be now ? We should be living in West Kensington , and I should be taking boarders — or — no!—a country - house , perhaps , with paying guests . You would be teaching the cockney idea how to shoot , at half a guinea a day , and I should be buying my clothes second - hand through The Exchange and Mart . Whereas — whereas — ”
41900	41941	41895	41895	She	208	“ You are a very rich man — you have a charming wife — a dear little girl — you can get into Parliament — travel , speculate , race , anything you please . And I did it all ! ”
41942	41950	41951	41951	he	1616	“ I do n't agree with you , ”
41959	42012	41955	41955	She	208	“ Well , we ca n't argue it — can we ? I only wanted to point out to you the plain , bare truth , that there is nothing in the world to prevent our being excellent friends again — now . But first — and once more — my letters ! ”
42026	42061	42013	42013	Her	208	“ I found two of them last night , by the merest chance — in an old despatch - box I took to America . They were posted to you on the way here . ”
42062	42070	42013	42013	Her	208	“ Good ! But there were three . ”
42071	42085	42013	42013	Her	208	“ I know — so you said . I could only find two . ”
42086	42097	42098	42098	He	1617	“ Was the particular letter I mentioned one of them ? ”
42102	42117	42098	42098	He	1617	“ No . I searched everywhere . I do n't believe I have it . ”
42125	42135	42136	42136	He	1617	“ You certainly have it . Please look again . ”
42194	42219	42226	42226	he	1617	“ Poor Theresa is so unhappy , so pursued ! You saw that odious paragraph last week ? I ca n't run the risk ! ”

But she 's too tight a hand for my taste . I say!—what do you think of this ! She would n't let Beattie come down to the drawing - room yesterday , because she cried for a sweet ! Was n't that devilish ! ”

42606	42625	42626	42626	He	1617	“ Well , no — I do n't ! She 's not the kind of woman I want . ”
42634	42644	42626	42626	He	1617	“ But my wife thinks a lot of her . ”
42828	42837	42816	42816	He	1617	“ We shall be late for the meet . ”

44283	44322	44277	44277	Roger	121	“ I shall soon think , Daphne , that somebody 's ‘ put a spell on you , ’ as my old nurse used to say . I wish I knew what I could do to break it . ”
44488	44496	44498	44498	Daphne	145	“ Where have you been all day ? ”

53237	53249	53232	53232	He	289	“ Miss Farmer ! What on earth are you doing here ? ”
53294	53303	53305	53306	the nurse	3212	“ Do n't come near her , sir ! ”
53313	53326	53305	53306	the nurse	3212	“ You have done quite enough . Let me attend to her . ”
53327	53335	53337	53337	Roger	121	“ You imagine that was my doing ? ”
53340	53362	53337	53337	Roger	121	“ Let me assure you it was nothing of the kind . And pray , were you listening at the door ? ”
53401	53407	53408	53408	he	289	“ Let me take her , ”
53412	53418	53408	53408	he	289	“ Daphne!—send this woman away . ”
53437	53447	53449	53450	Miss Farmer	234	“ You see in what a state she is ! ”
53457	53476	53449	53450	Miss Farmer	234	“ If you must speak to her , put it off , sir , at least till tomorrow . ”
53536	53542	53543	53543	she	246	“ You saw it all ? ”
53545	53549	53543	53543	she	246	imperiously—“the whole thing ? ”
53550	53553	53555	53556	Miss Farmer	234	“ All , ”
53558	53569	53555	53556	Miss Farmer	234	“ It 's a mercy you 're not more hurt . ”
53576	53602	53570	53570	Daphne	246	“ It 'll just do — I think it 'll just do ! But you 'll have to make a good deal out of it . ”
53635	53643	53644	53644	she	3212	“ It was lucky we heard him , ”
53648	53669	53644	53644	she	3212	“ I guessed at once he must be looking for something — I knew that room was full of papers . ”
53678	53682	53683	53684	The nurse	3212	“ Never mind . ”
53690	53695	53683	53684	The nurse	3212	“ It 's locked . ”
53696	53702	53704	53704	Roger	121	“ How is my wife ? ”
53717	53752	53704	53704	Roger	121	“ She 'll be all right , sir , I hope , if you 'll leave her to rest . But I wo n't answer for the consequences if she 's disturbed any more . ”
53908	53952	53896	53896	she	246	“ La vie est un orage , soit . Nous sommes orage et convulsion nous - mêmes . Laissons nous aller à cette loi qui emporte tout dans l'abîme , et il n'y a plus de société , plus d'humanité , plus rien . ”
54262	54281	54282	54283	The man	586	“ My dear Penrose!—how very good of you to come . I know how frightfully busy you are . ”
54344	54378	54379	54380	Herbert French	187	“ I am pretty busy — but your tale , Herbert , was a startler . If I can help you — or Barnes — command me . He is coming this afternoon ? ”
54388	54467	54379	54380	Herbert French	187	“ Of course . And another man — whom I met casually , in Pall Mall this morning — and had half an hour 's talk with — an American naval officer — an old acquaintance of Elsie's — Captain Boyson — will join us also . I met him at Harvard before our wedding , and liked him . He has just come over with his sister for a short holiday , and I ran across him . ”
54468	54479	54480	54481	Herbert French	187	“ Is there any particular point in his joining us ? ”
54507	54627	54628	54628	Penrose	255	story—“feels , so I gathered , very strongly about it , and on the man 's side ; and when I told him that Roger had just arrived and was coming to take counsel with you and me this afternoon , he suddenly asked if he might come , too . I was rather taken aback . I told him that we were going , of course , to consider the case entirely from the English point of view . He still said , ‘ Let me come ; I may be of use to you . ’ So I could only reply it must rest with Roger . They 'll show him first into the dining - room . ”
54631	54658	54628	54628	Penrose	255	“ All right , as long as he does n't mind his national toes trampled upon . So these are your new quarters , old fellow ? ”
54786	54788	55442	55442	French	187	trilogy—“flesh , ”
54789	54792	55442	55442	French	187	“ blood , ”
54794	54795	55442	55442	French	187	“ spirit”—was
54800	54808	54809	54809	he	1996	“ Yes , we 've settled in , ”
54818	54824	54809	54809	he	1996	“ And you like it ? ”
54825	54829	54809	54809	he	1996	“ We do . ”
54852	54855	54849	54849	Penrose	255	“ Well , now”—he
54864	54906	54907	54907	French	187	tone—“before he arrives , where precisely is this unhappy business ? I gather , by the way , that Barnes has got practically all his legal advice from the other side , though the solicitors here have been co - operating ? ”
54910	54977	54907	54907	French	187	“ I am still rather vague myself . Roger only arrived from New York the day before yesterday . His uncle , General Hobson , died a few weeks ago , and Roger came rushing home , as I understand , to see if he could make any ready money out of his inheritance . Money , in fact , seems to be his chief thought . ”
54978	54994	54907	54907	French	187	“ Money ? What for ? Mrs. Barnes 's suit was surely settled long ago ? ”
54995	55016	54907	54907	French	187	“ Oh , yes — months ago . She got her decree and the custody of the child in July . ”
55017	55029	54907	54907	French	187	“ Remind me of the details . Barnes refused to plead ? ”
55030	55058	54907	54907	French	187	“ Certainly . By the advice of the lawyers on both sides , he refused , as an Englishman , to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the court . ”
55059	55071	54907	54907	French	187	“ But he did what he could to stop the thing ? ”
55072	55237	54907	54907	French	187	“ Of course . He rushed out after his wife as soon as he could trace where she had gone ; and he made the most desperate attempts to alter her purpose . His letters , as far as I could make them out , were heart - rending . I very nearly went over to try and help him , but it was impossible to leave my work . Mrs. Barnes refused to see him . She was already at Sioux Falls , and had begun the residence necessary to bring her within the jurisdiction of the South Dakota Court . Roger , however , forced one or two interviews with her — most painful scenes!—but found her quite immovable . At the same time she was much annoyed and excited by the legal line that he was advised to take ; and there was a moment when she tried to bribe him to accept the divorce and submit to the American court . ”
55238	55246	54907	54907	French	187	“ To bribe him ! With money ? ”
55247	55423	54907	54907	French	187	“ No ; with the child . Beatty at first was hidden away , and Roger could find no traces of her . But for a few weeks she was sent to stay with a Mrs. Verrier at Philadelphia , and Roger was allowed to see her , while Mrs. Barnes negotiated . It was a frightful dilemma ! If he submitted , Mrs. Barnes promised that Beatty should go to him for two months every year ; if not , and she obtained her decree , and the custody of the child , as she was quite confident of doing , he should never — as far as she could secure it — see Beatty again . He , too , foresaw that she would win her suit ; he was sorely tempted ; but he stood firm . Then , before he could make up his mind what to do as to the child , the suit came on , Mrs. Barnes got her decree , and the custody of the little girl . ”
55424	55441	55442	55442	French	187	“ On the ground of ‘ cruelty , ’ I understand , and ‘ indignities ’ ? ”
55450	55463	55445	55445	His	187	“ And by the help of evidence that any liar could supply ! ”
55464	55470	54907	54907	French	187	“ Who were her witnesses ? ”
55471	55550	54907	54907	French	187	“ Beatty 's nurse — one Agnes Farmer — and a young fellow who had been employed on the decorative work at Heston . There were relations tions between these two , and Roger tells me they have married lately , on a partnership bought by Mrs. Barnes . While the work was going on at Heston the young man used to put up at an inn in the country town , and talk scandal at the bar . ”
55551	55568	55445	55445	His	187	“ Then there was some local scandal — on the subject of Barnes and Mrs. Fairmile ? ”
55569	55705	54907	54907	French	187	“ Possibly . Scandal pour rire ! Not a soul believed that there was anything more in it than mischief on the woman 's side , and a kind of incapacity for dealing with a woman as she deserved , on the man 's . Mrs. Fairmile has been an intrigante from her cradle . Barnes was at one time deeply in love with her . His wife became jealous of her after the marriage , and threw them together , by way of getting at the truth , and he shilly - shallied with the situation , instead of putting a prompt end to it , as of course he ought to have done . He was honestly fond of his wife the whole time , and devoted to his home and his child . ”
55706	55746	55747	55747	French	187	“ Well , she did n't plead , you say , anything more than ‘ cruelty ’ and ‘ indignities . ’ The scandal , such as it was , was no doubt part of the ‘ cruelty ’ ? ”
55750	55765	55747	55747	French	187	“ And you suspect that money played a great part in the whole transaction ? ”
55766	55799	55800	55800	Penrose	255	“ I do n't suspect — the evidence goes a long way beyond that . Mrs. Barnes bought the show ! I am told there are a thousand ways of doing it . ”
55805	55829	55800	55800	Penrose	255	“ Well , then — what happened ? I imagine that by this time Barnes had not much affection left for his wife ? ”
55830	55836	55838	55838	French	187	“ I do n't know , ”
55842	56007	55838	55838	French	187	“ I believe the whole thing was a great blow to him . He was never passionately in love with her , but he was very fond of her in his own way — increasingly fond of her — up to that miserable autumn at Heston . However , after the decree , his one thought was for Beatty . His whole soul has been wrapped up in that child from the first moment she was put into his arms . When he first realised that his wife meant to take her from him , Boyson tells me that he seemed to lose his head . He was like a person unnerved and bewildered , not knowing how to act or where to turn . First of all , he brought an action — a writ of habeas corpus , I think — to recover his daughter , as an English subject . But the fact was he had put it off too long — ”
56008	56011	56013	56013	Penrose	255	“ Naturally , ”
56019	56030	56013	56013	Penrose	255	“ Not much hope for him — after the decree . ”
56031	56328	56329	56329	French	187	“ So he discovered , poor old fellow ! The action was , of course , obstructed and delayed in every way , by the power of Mrs. Barnes 's millions behind the scenes . His lawyers told him plainly from the beginning that he had precious little chance . And presently he found himself the object of a press campaign in some of the yellow papers — all of it paid for and engineered by his wife . He was held up as the brutal fortune - hunting Englishman , who had beguiled an American heiress to marry him , had carried her off to England to live upon her money , had then insulted her by scandalous flirtations with a lady to whom he had formerly been engaged , had shown her constant rudeness and unkindness , and had finally , in the course of a quarrel , knocked her down , inflicting shock and injury from which she had suffered ever since . Mrs. Barnes had happily freed herself from him , but he was now trying to bully her through the child — had , it was said , threatened to carry off the little girl by violence . Mrs. Barnes went in terror of him . America , however , would know how to protect both the mother and the child ! You can imagine the kind of thing . Well , very soon Roger began to find himself a marked man in hotels , followed in the streets , persecuted by interviewers ; and the stream of lies that found its way even into the respectable newspapers about him , his former life , his habits , etc . , is simply incredible ! Unfortunately , he gave some handle — ”
56334	56337	56339	56339	Penrose	255	“ Ah ! ”
56341	56347	56339	56339	Penrose	255	“ I have heard rumours . ”
56357	56369	56370	56370	he	187	“ It is a matter I can hardly speak of calmly , ”
56375	56436	56370	56370	he	187	“ The night after that first scene between them , the night of her fall — her pretended fall , so Roger told me — he went downstairs in his excitement and misery , and drank , one way and another , nearly a bottle of brandy , a thing he had never done in his life before . But — ”
56437	56445	56446	56446	French	187	“ He has often done it since ? ”
56459	56490	56446	56446	French	187	“ Do n't , however , suppose the thing worse than it is . Give him a gleam of hope and happiness , and he would soon shake it off . ”
56491	56500	56370	56370	he	187	“ Well , what came of his action ? ”
56501	56684	56446	56446	French	187	“ Nothing — so far . I believe he has ceased to take any interest in it . Another line of action altogether was suggested to him . About three months ago he made an attempt to kidnap the child , and was foiled . He got word that she had been taken to Charlestown , and he went there with a couple of private detectives . But Mrs. Barnes was on the alert , and when he discovered the villa in which the child had been living , she had been removed . It was a bitter shock and disappointment , and when he got back to New York in November , in the middle of an epidemic , he was struck down by influenza and pneumonia . It went pretty hard with him . You will be shocked by his appearance . Ecco ! was there ever such a story ! Do you remember , Penrose , what a magnificent creature he was that year he played for Oxford , and you and I watched his innings from the pavilion ? ”
56735	56766	56845	56846	the speaker	542	“ But now , with regard to money ; you say he wants money . But surely , at the time of the marriage , something was settled on him ? ”
56767	56802	56845	56846	the speaker	542	“ Certainly , a good deal . But from the moment she left him , and the Heston bills were paid , he has never touched a farthing of it , and never will . ”
56803	56833	56834	56834	French	187	“ So that the General 's death was opportune ? Well , it 's a deplorable affair ! And I wish I saw any chance of being of use . ”
56839	56844	56845	56846	the speaker	542	“ Because you know , ”
56850	56863	56845	56846	the speaker	542	“ there 's nothing to be done . The thing 's finished . ”
56864	56867	56845	56846	the speaker	542	“ Finished ? ”
56874	56902	56868	56868	French	187	“ And the law can do nothing ! Society can do nothing , to help that man either to right himself , or to recover his child ? Ah!”—he
56905	56909	56868	56868	French	187	listen—“here he is ! ”
56957	56987	56948	56948	French	187	“ Come in , Roger ! Here 's George Penrose — as I promised you . Sit down , old man . They 'll bring us some tea presently . ”
57029	57140	57020	57020	French	187	“ Well , here we are , Roger!—and if there 's anything whatever in this horrible affair where an English lawyer can help you , Penrose is your man . You know , I expect , what a swell he is ? A K.C. after seven years — lucky dog!—and last year he was engaged in an Anglo - American case not wholly unlike yours — Brown v. Brown . So I thought of him as the best person among your old friends and mine to come and give us some private informal help to - day , before you take any fresh steps — if you do take any . ”
57141	57148	57149	57150	The speaker	542	“ Awfully good of you both . ”
57173	57179	57180	57180	he	542	“ Awfully good of you , ”
57379	57419	57367	57367	French	187	“ Roger ! I do n't know whether you will allow it , but I met an American acquaintance of yours to - day , and , subject to your permission , I asked him to join our conference . ”
57433	57439	57422	57422	his	2007	“ Who on earth — ? ”
57440	57444	57445	57447	The young man	290	“ Captain Boyson ? ”
57452	57459	57460	57460	he	290	“ I do n't mind him , ”
57464	57505	57460	57460	he	290	“ He 's an awfully good sort . He was in Philadelphia a few months ago , when I was . He knows all about me . It was he and his sister who introduced me to — my wife . ”
57546	57564	57565	57565	He	255	“ How do you do , Boyson ? I 've told them you know all about it . ”
57573	57584	57586	57589	the new - comer	1250	“ I thought I might possibly put in a word , ”
57598	57618	57586	57589	the new - comer	1250	“ I trust I was not impertinent ? But do n't let me interrupt anything that was going on . ”
57853	57865	57840	57840	he	255	“ Is that about the truth , Boyson ? You know . ”
57866	57873	57875	57876	the American	2020	“ Yes , I endorse it , ”
57893	57931	57879	57879	His	2020	“ And you know what all their papers said of me — what they wished people to believe — that I was n't fit to have charge of Beatty — that I should have done her harm ? ”
57953	57960	57947	57947	Boyson	140	“ I did n't believe it . ”
57980	57984	57985	57985	he	2030	“ Look here ! ”
57989	58004	57985	57985	he	2030	“ I want some money at once — and a good lot of it . ”
58015	58145	58005	58005	He	2030	“ There 's this place of my uncle 's , and I 'm dashed if I can get a penny out of it ! I went to his solicitors this morning . They drove me mad with their red - tape nonsense . It will take some time , they say , to get a mortgage on it , and meanwhile they do n't seem inclined to advance me anything , or a hundred or two , perhaps . What 's that ? I lost my temper , and next time I go they 'll turn me out , I dare say . But there 's the truth . It 's money I want , and if you ca n't help me to money it 's no use talking . ”
58146	58160	58162	58162	Penrose	255	“ And when you get the money what 'll you do with it ? ”
58164	58202	58162	58162	Penrose	255	“ Pay half a dozen people who can be trusted to help me kidnap Beatty and smuggle her over the Canadian frontier . I bungled the thing once . I do n't mean to bungle it again . ”
58228	58236	58237	58237	French	187	“ And there is no other way ? ”
58246	58250	58251	58251	Roger	121	“ Ask him ? ”
58256	58278	58251	58251	Roger	121	“ Is there any legal way , Boyson , in which I can recover the custody and companionship of my child ? ”
58283	58298	58279	58279	Boyson	140	“ None that I know of — and I have made every possible inquiry . ”
58299	58303	58305	58305	Barnes	121	“ And yet , ”
58315	58334	58305	58305	Barnes	121	“ by the law of England I am still Daphne 's husband and that child 's legal guardian ? ”
58335	58338	58279	58279	Boyson	140	“ Certainly . ”
58339	58369	58279	58279	Boyson	140	“ And if I could once get her upon ground under the English flag , she would be mine again , and no power could take her from me ? ”
58370	58383	58305	58305	Barnes	121	“ Except the same private violence that you yourself propose to exercise . ”
58384	58392	58394	58394	Roger	121	“ I 'd take care of that ! ”
58397	58406	58408	58408	French	187	“ How do you mean to do it ? ”
58430	58438	58444	58446	the American officer	392	“ He and I 'll manage it , ”
58452	58455	58457	58457	French	187	“ You ? ”
58459	58472	58457	58457	French	187	“ An officer in active service ? It might injure your career ! ”
58473	58479	58444	58446	the American officer	392	“ I shall risk it . ”
58490	58515	58516	58516	He	2036	“ My dear French , this is much more amusing than the law . But I do n't quite see where I come in . ”
58539	58550	58551	58551	he	2036	“ My sister and I introduced Daphne Floyd to Barnes , ”
58555	58610	58551	58551	he	2036	“ and it is my country , as I hold — or a portion of it — that allows these villainies . Some day we shall get a great reaction in the States , and then the reforms that plenty of us are clamouring for will come about . Meanwhile , as of course you know”—he
58612	58766	58767	58767	Barnes	121	French—“New Yorkers and Bostonians suffer almost as much from the abominations that Nevada and South Dakota call laws , as Barnes has suffered . Marriage in the eastern States is as sacred as with you — South Carolina allows no divorce at all — but with this licence at our gates , no one is safe , and thousands of our women , in particular — for the women bring two - thirds of the actions — are going to the deuce , simply because they have the opportunity of going . And the children — it does n't bear thinking of ! Well — no good haranguing ! I 'm ashamed of my country in this matter — I have been for a long time — and I mean to help Barnes out , coûte que coûte ! And as to the money , Barnes , you and I 'll discuss that . ”
58913	58925	58926	58926	he	255	“ Is there any chance of Mrs. Barnes 's marrying again ? ”
58934	58941	58929	58929	Barnes	121	“ Not that I know of . ”
58942	58952	58907	58907	Penrose	255	“ There 's no one else in the case ? ”
58953	58960	58961	58961	Roger	121	“ I never heard of anyone . ”
58969	59010	58961	58961	Roger	121	“ What she 's done , she 's done because she was tired of me , not because she was in love with anyone else . That was her great score in the divorce case — that there was nobody . ”

59397	59453	59375	59375	He	2062	“ Well , I might have spared my pains . The letters were returned to me from the States . Daphne had arranged it all so cleverly that I was some time in tracing her . By the time I had got to Sioux Falls she was through a month of her necessary residence . My God!”—his

But I would n't believe that Daphne could persist in such a monstrous thing , and , if she did , that any decent country would aid and abet her . ”
59533	59568	59524	59524	he	140	“ I am ashamed to remind you , Barnes,—again — that your case is no worse than that of scores of American citizens . We are the first to suffer from our own enormities . ”

And in July I could take you to Newport . I must be off next week , for I 've promised to take the chair at a big meeting at Buffalo on the 29th . But I ca n't bear to leave you behind . We could make the journey quite easy for you . That new car of mine is very comfortable . ”

Yet both Elsie and I feel that he cares for us as much as ever . And , indeed , poor fellow , he himself remains strangely lovable , in spite of what one must — alas!—believe as to his ways of life and the people with whom he associates . There is in him , always , something of what Myers called ‘ the imperishable child . ’ That a man who might have been so easily led to good has been so fatally thrust into evil is one of the abiding sorrows of my life . How can I reproach him for his behaviour ? As the law stands , he can never marry ; he can never have legitimate children . Under the wrong he has suffered , and , no doubt , in consequence of that illness in New York , when he was badly nursed and cared for — from which , in fact , he has never wholly recovered — his will - power and nerve , which were never very strong , have given way ; he broods upon the past perpetually , and on the loss of his child . Our poor Apollo , Boyson , will soon have lost himself wholly , and there is no one to help . “

The news in it gave me great concern . Then I saw you appear , to my astonishment , in the distance . I asked the hotel manager if it were really you . He was about to send someone after you . An idea occurred to me . I saw my opportunity — and I pursued you . ”

68226	68241	68220	68220	Daphne	145	“ You have left me no choice . However , I am quite willing . ”
68324	68358	68359	68359	He	2367	“ I wished to ask you a question , in the name of our old friendship ; and because I have also become a friend — as you know — of your husband . ”

It is indeed of him and of his present state that I beg to be allowed to speak to you . ”
68498	68555	68486	68486	He	2367	“ You beg for what you have already taken . I repeat , I am at your mercy . An American subject , Captain Boyson , knows nothing of the law of England . I have recovered my American citizenship , and the law of my country has freed me from a degrading and disastrous marriage ! ”
68556	68587	68588	68588	His	2367	“ While Roger remains bound ? Incapable , at the age of thirty , of marrying again , unless he renounces his country — permanently debarred from home and children ! ”

68825	68856	68762	68762	she	2372	“ One moment ! Do you forget that from the day you left him Roger has never touched a farthing of your money ? That he returned everything to you ? ”
68857	68872	68762	68762	she	2372	“ I had nothing to do with that ; it was his own folly . ”
68873	68914	68915	68915	She	2372	“ Yes , but it throws light upon his character . Would a mere fortune - hunter have done it ? No , Mrs. Barnes!—that view of Roger does not really convince you , you do not really believe it . ”
68919	68939	68915	68915	She	2372	“ As it happens , in his letters to me after I left him , he amply confessed it . ”
68940	68992	68762	68762	she	2372	“ Because his wish was to make peace , to throw himself at your feet . He accused himself , more than was just . But you do not really think him mercenary and greedy , you know that he was neither ! Mrs. Barnes , Roger is ill and lonely . ”
68993	69002	68762	68762	she	2372	“ His mode of life accounts for it . ”
69003	69069	68915	68915	She	2372	“ You mean that he has begun to drink , has fallen into bad company . That may be true . I can not deny it . But consider . A man from whom everything is torn at one blow ; a man of not very strong character , not accustomed to endure hardness.—Does it never occur to you that you took a frightful responsibility ? ”
69070	69079	69080	69080	He	2373	“ I protected myself — and my child . ”
69084	69102	69103	69103	He	2373	“ Or rather — did you murder a life — that God had given you in trust ? ”
69197	69211	69183	69183	Daphne	145	“ Captain Boyson ! I — I can not bear this any longer . ”
69212	69221	69222	69222	he	2373	“ I will not reproach you any more , ”
69227	69300	69301	69301	He	2373	“ I beg your pardon . The past is irrevocable , but the present is here . The man who loved you , the father of your child , is alone , ill , poor , in danger of moral ruin , because of what you have done . I ask you to go to his aid . But first let me tell you exactly what I have just heard from England . ”
69318	69324	69326	69326	Daphne	145	“ He has his mother , ”
69338	69360	69326	69326	Daphne	145	“ Lady Barnes I hear had a paralytic stroke two months ago . She is incapable of giving advice or help . ”
69361	69373	69421	69421	she	145	“ Of course , I am sorry . But Herbert French — ”
69374	69387	69388	69388	he	2373	“ No one but a wife could save him — no one ! ”
69393	69400	69401	69401	she	145	“ I am not his wife ! ”
69405	69419	69401	69401	she	145	“ I released myself by American law . He is nothing to me . ”
69514	69777	69508	69508	He	140	“ Bear with me , Mrs. Barnes , for a few moments , while I put it as it appears to another mind . You became first jealous of Roger , for very small reason , then tired of him . Your marriage no longer satisfied you — you resolved to be quit of it ; so you appealed to laws of which , as a nation , we are ashamed , which all that is best among us will , before long , rebel against and change . Our State system permits them — America suffers . In this case — forgive me if I put it once more as it appears to me — they have been used to strike at an Englishman who had absolutely no defence , no redress . And now you are free ; he remains bound — so long , at least , as you form no other tie . Again I ask you , have you ever let yourself face what it means to a man of thirty to be cut off from lawful marriage and legitimate children?—Mrs . Barnes ! you know what a man is , his strength and his weakness . Are you really willing that Roger should sink into degradation in order that you may punish him for some offence to your pride or your feeling ? It may be too late ! He may , as French fears , have fallen into some fatal entanglement ; it may not be possible to restore his health . He may not be able”—he
69785	69885	69508	69508	He	140	firmly—“to forgive you . Or again , French 's anxieties about him may be unfounded . But for God 's sake go to him ! Once on English ground you are his wife again as though nothing had happened . For God 's sake put everything aside but the thought of the vow you once made to him ! Go back ! I implore you , go back ! I promise you that no happiness you have ever felt will be equal to the happiness that step would bring you , if only you are permitted to save him . ”
70040	70046	70047	70047	she	145	“ This conversation must end , ”
70051	70069	70047	70047	she	145	“ Captain Boyson , I appeal to you as a gentleman , let me go on alone . ”
70106	70109	70110	70110	he	2380	“ Please ! ”
70114	70120	70110	70110	he	2380	“ this bit is unsafe . ”
70181	70185	70186	70186	he	2380	“ Forgive me ! ”
70193	70213	70186	70186	he	2380	“ But think of what I have said — I beg of you ! Be kind , be merciful ! ”
70227	70245	70224	70224	she	145	“ I bear you no malice . But you do n't understand me , you never have . ”
70379	70388	70389	70389	he	140	“ Do you suppose I produced any effect ? ”
70394	70430	70389	70389	he	140	“ If she really thinks over what I said , she must be touched ! unless she 's made of flint . I said all the wrong things — but I did rub it in . ”

70471	70494	70461	70461	she	1168	“ That means you think I behaved like a fool , and that my appeal wo n't move her in the least ? ”
70501	70507	70508	70508	she	1168	“ Dear , dear optimist ! ”
70531	70538	70525	70525	she	1168	“ You took a great responsibility ! ”
70539	70543	70544	70544	She	1168	“ Towards her ? ”
70549	70555	70546	70546	her	1168	“ No — towards him ! ”

71129	71138	71142	71142	she	146	“ If Alfred Boyson knew so and so ! ”
71151	71159	71142	71142	she	146	“ Could I even tell Madeleine that ? ”
71168	71188	71189	71189	She	146	“ I shall never tell her anything any more . She is lost to me — even before death . ”
71649	71653	71635	71635	She	159	“ The water ! ”
71659	71673	71635	71635	She	159	“ it was once so terrible . I am not afraid — now . ”
71674	71684	71635	71635	She	159	“ No , darling . Why should you be ? ”
71685	71696	71697	71697	Daphne	146	“ I know now , I shall see him again . ”
71701	71724	71697	71697	Daphne	146	“ I hoped it , but I could n't be certain . That was so awful . Now — I am certain . ”
71725	71732	71733	71733	She	146	“ Since you became a Catholic ? ”
71740	71751	71752	71752	she	146	“ I could n't be uncertain — I could n't ! ”
71817	71851	71811	71811	Madeleine	159	“ I could n't talk , Daphne — I was afraid ; but I 've written to you , just bit by bit , as I had strength . Oh , Daphne — ! ”

71978	72052	72055	72055	Daphne	146	“ DAPHNE , DARLING,—It was I who first taught you that we may follow our own lawless wills , and that marriage is something we may bend or break as we will . But , oh ! it is not so . Marriage is mysterious and wonderful ; it is the supreme test of men and women . If we wrong it , and despise it , we mutilate the divine in ourselves . “
72076	72128	72129	72129	Daphne	146	“ And you can still say it to the living . It has been my anguish that I could only say it to the dead . Daphne , good - bye ! I have fought a long , long fight , but God is Master — I bless — I adore — ”
72210	72212	72185	72185	they	2428	“ forgiveness ”

74103	74110	74084	74084	she	2471	“ You have murdered a life ! ”
74292	74304	74305	74305	she	2471	“ It was never me he cared for — only Beatty ! ”
74553	74582	74534	74534	his	2530	“ As to Beatty , I hold you responsible ! She is my child , no less than yours . You shall answer to me ! Remember that ! ”
74626	74629	74603	74603	she	2471	“ Daddy ! ”
74765	74780	74733	74733	her	2471	“ twenty minutes ' conversation on a subject of common interest to us both . ”

74878	74952	74953	74953	Daphne	145	“ He is , however , much better , I am glad to say , and if the subject on which you wish to speak to him is really urgent , his present address is Prospect House , St. Damian 's , Ventnor . But unless it is urgent it would be a kindness not to trouble him with it until he returns to town , which will not be for another fortnight . ”

75342	75350	75351	75351	she	145	“ Is Mr. Herbert French at home ? ”
75368	75396	75361	75362	The girl	396	“ Yes , ma'am — but he does n't see visitors yet . Shall I tell Mrs. French ? She 's in the garden with the children . ”
75397	75403	75405	75405	Daphne	145	“ No , thank you , ”
75409	75447	75405	75405	Daphne	145	“ It 's Mr. French I have come to see , and I am sure that he will wish to see me . Will you kindly give him my card ? I will come in and wait . ”
75513	75516	75518	75519	Herbert French	187	“ Elsie ! ”
75548	75551	75552	75552	His	187	“ Elsie ! ”

75641	75656	75632	75632	he	187	“ Well , sir , she 's a dark lady , dressed very smart — ”
75657	75664	75600	75600	They	2577	“ Has she very black eyes ? ”
75665	75672	75600	75600	They	2577	“ Oh , yes , sir ! ”
75673	75676	75677	75678	The girl	396	“ Young ? ”
75693	75704	75600	75600	They	2577	“ Well , I should n't say so , sir . ”
75710	75719	75720	75720	He	187	“ Thank you . I will come in . ”

75758	75767	75769	75769	French	124	“ I suspect it is — Mrs. Barnes , ”
75772	75790	75769	75769	French	124	“ Help me on with my coat , darling . Now then , what shall we do ? ”
75791	75803	75805	75806	his wife	1168	“ She ca n't have come to force herself on him ! ”
75809	75826	75805	75806	his wife	1168	“ Probably she knows nothing of his being here . Did he go for a walk ? ”
75827	75840	75769	75769	French	124	“ Yes , towards Sandown . But he will be back directly . ”
75885	75895	75896	75896	he	187	“ What can that woman have come to say ? ”
75931	75936	75917	75917	Elsie	124	“ Perhaps she repents ! ”
75951	75959	75960	75960	French	124	“ I doubt it ! But Roger ? ”
75966	75997	75998	75998	They	2587	“ Keep him , darling — intercept him if you can . If he must see her , I will come out . But we must n't risk a shock . ”
76040	76050	76020	76020	She	124	“ You wished to see me , Mrs. Barnes ? ”
76085	76106	76107	76107	French	124	“ My name is no longer what you once knew it , Mr. French . I sent you my card . ”
76123	76137	76138	76138	Daphne	145	“ Pray sit down . May I know what has brought you here ? ”
76151	76181	76143	76143	her	145	“ I wished to come and consult with you , Mr. French . I had heard a distressing account of — of Roger , from a friend in America . ”
76182	76186	76188	76188	French	124	“ I see , ”
76197	76220	76188	76188	French	124	“ You met Boyson at Niagara — that I knew — and you are here because of what he said to you ? ”
76221	76226	76227	76228	The speaker	542	“ Yes , partly . ”
76306	76413	76303	76303	Daphne	145	“ If Captain Boyson has given you an account of our interview , Mr. French , it was probably a one - sided one . However , that is not the point . He did distress me very much by his account , which I gather came from you — of — of Roger , and although , of course , it is a very awkward matter for me to move in , I still felt impelled for old times ' sake to come over and see whether I could not help you — and his other friends — and , of course , his mother — ”
76414	76423	76425	76425	French	187	“ His mother is out of the question , ”
76427	76441	76303	76303	Daphne	145	“ She is , I am sorry to say , a helpless invalid . ”
76442	76483	76303	76303	Daphne	145	“ Is it really as bad as that ? I hoped for better news . Then I apply to you — to you chiefly . Is there anything that I could do to assist you , or others , to — ”
76484	76489	76490	76490	French	187	“ To save him ? ”
76503	76509	76511	76511	French	187	“ What is your idea ? ”
76517	76598	76511	76511	French	187	“ You heard , I presume , from Captain Boyson that my wife and I were extremely anxious about Roger 's ways and habits ; that we can not induce him , or , at any rate , we have not yet been able to induce him , to give up drinking ; that his health is extremely bad , and that we are sometimes afraid that there is now some secret in his life of which he is ashamed ? ”
76599	76602	76604	76604	Daphne	145	“ Yes , ”
76614	76623	76604	76604	Daphne	145	“ Yes , that is what I heard . ”
76624	76633	76511	76511	French	187	“ And you have come to suggest something ? ”
76634	76651	76652	76652	she	145	“ Is there no way by which Roger can become as free as I now am ! ”
76661	76682	76658	76658	her	145	“ By which Roger can obtain his divorce from you — and marry again ? None , in English law . ”
76683	76692	76693	76693	She	145	“ But there is — in Colonial law . ”
76701	76780	76693	76693	She	145	“ If Roger were to go to New Zealand , or to Australia , he could , after a time , get a divorce for desertion . I know he could — I have inquired . It does n't seem to be certain what effect my action — the American decree , I mean — would have in an English colony . My lawyers are going into it . But at any rate there is the desertion . And then”—she
76783	76812	76658	76658	her	145	eager—“if he married abroad — in the Colony — the marriage would be valid . No one could say a word to him when he returned to England . ”
76846	76962	76820	76820	She	2598	“ Could we not induce him to go ? Could you not ? Very likely he would refuse to see me ; and , of course , he has , most unjustly to me , I think , refused to take any money from me . But the money might be provided without his knowing where it came from . A young doctor might be sent with him — some nice fellow who would keep him amused and look after him . At Heston he used to take a great interest in farming . He might take up land . I would pay anything — anything ! He might suppose it came from some friend . ”
76978	76995	76974	76974	She	2602	“ I beg of you , Mr. French , not to set yourself against me ! Of course”—she
76999	77054	76974	76974	She	2602	proudly—“I know what you must think of my action . Our views are different , irreconcilably different . You probably think all divorce wrong . We think , in America , that a marriage which has become a burden to either party is no marriage , and ought to cease . But that , of course”—she
77058	77099	76974	76974	She	2602	hand—“we can not discuss . I do not propose for a moment to discuss it . You must allow me my national point of view . But surely we can , putting all that aside , combine to help Roger ? ”
77100	77105	77107	77107	French	187	“ To marry again ? ”
77111	77140	77107	77107	French	187	“ It ca n't , I fear , be done — what you propose — in the time . I doubt whether Roger has two years to live . ”
77144	77148	77149	77149	she	145	“ Roger!—to live ? ”
77155	77174	77149	77149	she	145	“ What is really the matter ? Surely nothing more than care and a voyage could set right ? ”
77180	77320	77177	77177	his	187	“ We have been anxious about him for some time . That terrible attack of septic pneumonia in New York , as we now know , left the heart injured and the lungs weakened . He was badly nursed , and his state of mind at the time — his misery and loneliness — left him little chance . Then the drinking habit , which he contracted during those wretched months in the States , has been of course sorely against him . However , we hoped against hope — Elsie and I — till a few weeks ago . Then someone , we do n't know who , made him go to a specialist , and the verdict is — phthisis ; not very advanced , but certain and definite . And the general outlook is not favourable . ”
77326	77333	77334	77334	she	145	“ We must send him away ! ”
77338	77385	77334	77334	she	145	“ We must ! A voyage , a good doctor , a dry climate , would save him , of course they would ! Why , there is nothing necessarily fatal now in phthisis ! Nothing ! It is absurd to talk as though there were . ”
77425	77438	77440	77440	Daphne	145	“ Oh , do say something ! Tell me what you suggest ? ”
77442	77455	77440	77440	Daphne	145	“ Do you really wish me to tell you what I suggest ? ”
77479	77520	77469	77469	He	2603	“ Go , Mrs. Barnes , and ask your husband 's forgiveness ! What will come of it I do not know . But you , at least , will have done something to set yourself right — with God . ”
77556	77596	77547	77547	Daphne	145	“ It is you , then , Mr. French , who make it impossible for me to discuss — to help . I shall have to see if I can find some other means of carrying out my purpose . ”
77606	77611	77612	77612	French	187	“ Who is that ? ”
77689	77692	77693	77694	A man	2682	“ Roger ! ”
77737	77742	77744	77744	French	124	“ Leave them alone , ”
77821	77829	77831	77831	Roger	121	“ What do you want with me ? ”
77842	77854	77855	77855	Daphne	145	“ By God , I never wished to see you again ! ”
77864	77876	77855	77855	Daphne	145	“ I know that . You need n't tell me so ! ”
77881	77890	77891	77891	he	2682	“ You 'll admit it 's an intrusion ? ”
77895	77913	77891	77891	he	2682	“ I do n't see what you and I have got to do with each other now . ”
77940	77969	77934	77934	She	145	“ Roger — I — I did n't come to discuss the past . That 's done with . But — I heard things about you — that — ”
77970	77976	77977	77977	he	2682	“ You did n't like ? ”
77980	77998	77977	77977	he	2682	“ I 'm sorry , but I do n't see what you have to do with them . ”
78013	78035	77999	77999	Daphne	145	“ Could n't we talk without bitterness ? Just for ten minutes ? It was from Captain Boyson that I heard — ”
78036	78080	78081	78081	He	2682	“ Oh , Boyson , was that it ? And he got his information from French — poor old Herbert . Well , it 's quite true . I 'm no longer fit for your — or his — or anybody 's society . ”
78256	78259	78249	78249	he	2682	“ Well ? ”
78260	78269	78270	78270	Daphne	145	“ I came to try and help you , ”
78279	78294	78275	78275	her	145	“ to ask Mr. French what I could do . It made me unhappy — ”
78295	78299	78300	78300	He	2682	“ Did it ? ”
78304	78339	78340	78340	he	2682	“ I do n't see why . Oh , you need n't trouble yourself . Elsie and Herbert are awfully good to me . They 're all I want , or at any rate , ”
78345	78375	78340	78340	he	2682	“ they 're all I shall want — from now on . Anyway , you know there 'd be something grotesque in your trying your hand at reforming me . ”
78376	78386	78387	78387	she	2621	“ I did n't mean anything of the kind ! ”
78395	78423	78387	78387	she	2621	“ I — I wanted to suggest something practical — some way by which you might — release yourself from me — and also recover your health . ”
78424	78430	78431	78431	he	2682	“ Release myself from you ? ”
78434	78457	78431	78431	he	2682	“ That 's easier said than done . Did you mean to send me to the Colonies — was that your idea ? ”
78475	78518	78466	78466	she	2621	“ That seems to be the only way — in English law . Why should n't you take it ? The voyage , the new climate , would probably set you up again . You need only be away a short time . ”
78532	78536	78537	78537	he	2682	“ Thank you , ”
78542	78579	78580	78580	he	2682	“ thank you . And I suppose you offered us money ? You told Herbert you would pay all expenses ? Oh , do n't be angry ! I did n't mean anything uncivil . But , ”
78590	78621	78580	78580	he	2682	“ at the same time , perhaps you ought to know that I would sooner die a thousand times over than take a single silver sixpence that belonged to you ! ”
78637	78654	78655	78655	she	2621	“ Of course I ca n't argue with you if you meet me in that tone , ”
78659	78666	78655	78655	she	2621	“ But I should have thought — ”
78667	78670	78671	78671	he	2682	“ Besides , ”
78675	78766	78671	78671	he	2682	“ you say it is the only way . You are quite mistaken . It is not the only way . As far as freeing me goes , you could divorce me to - morrow — here — if you liked . I have been unfaithful to you . A strange way of putting it — at the present moment — between you and me ! But that 's how it would appear in the English courts . And as to the ‘ cruelty’—that would n't give you any trouble ! ”
78790	78794	78795	78795	she	145	“ Mrs. Fairmile ? ”
78813	78869	78802	78802	He	2682	“ Mrs. Fairmile ! You do n't mean to tell me , Daphne , to my face , that you ever believed any of the lies — forgive the expression — that you , and your witnesses , and your lawyers , told in the States — that you bribed those precious newspapers to tell ? ”
78870	78877	78878	78878	she	145	“ Of course I believed it ! ”
78882	78895	78878	78878	she	145	“ And as for lies , it was you who began them . ”
78896	78908	78909	78909	He	2623	“ You believed that I had betrayed you with Chloe Fairmile ? ”
78924	78929	78909	78909	He	2623	“ I never said — ”
78930	78956	78957	78957	He	2623	“ No ! To that length you did n't quite go . I admit it . You were able to get your way without it . ”
78965	79081	78957	78957	He	2623	“ No , my remark had nothing to do with Chloe . I have never set eyes on her since I left you at Heston . But — there was a girl , a shop - girl , a poor little thing , rather pretty . I came across her about six months ago — it does n't matter how . She loves me , she was awfully good to me , a regular little brick . Some day I shall tell Herbert all about her — not yet — though , of course , he suspects . She 'd serve your purpose , if you thought it worth while . But you wo n't — ”
79082	79091	78909	78909	He	2623	“ You're — living with her — now ? ”
79092	79132	79133	79133	his	2624	“ No . I broke with her a fortnight ago , after I 'd seen those doctors . She made me see them , poor little soul . Then I went to say goodbye to her , and she , ”
79139	79180	79133	79133	his	2624	“ she took it hard . But it 's all right . I 'm not going to risk her life , or saddle her with a dying man . She 's with her sister . She 'll get over it . ”
79201	79239	79183	79183	his	2624	“ It 's been a bad business , but it was n't altogether my fault . I saved her from someone else , and she saved me , once or twice , from blowing my brains out . ”
79240	79249	79251	79251	Daphne	145	“ What did the doctors say to you ? ”
79259	79267	79268	79268	he	2624	“ They gave me about two years , ”
79283	79289	79268	79268	he	2624	“ That does n't matter . ”
79319	79415	79416	79416	He	2624	“ Look here , Daphne , do n't let 's waste time . We shall never see each other again , and there are a number of things I want to know . Tell me everything you can remember about Beatty that last six months — and about her illness , you understand — never mind repeating what you told Boyson , and he told me . But there 's lots more , there must be . Did she ever ask for me ? Boyson said you could n't remember . But you must remember ! ”
79473	79476	79477	79477	she	246	“ Yes , ”
79482	79489	79477	79477	she	246	“ she did ask for you . ”
79490	79493	79494	79494	He	2624	“ Ah ! ”
79501	79516	79520	79520	his	2624	“ Tell me — tell me at once — everything — from the beginning ! ”
79643	79652	79653	79653	he	2624	“ I 'll forgive you much for that ! ”
79660	79677	79653	79653	he	2624	“ Will you write it for me — some day — all you 've told me ? ”
79685	79728	79729	79729	She	246	“ Well , now , you must n't stay here any longer . I suppose you 've got a carriage ? And we must n't meet again . There 's no object in it . But I 'll remember that you came . ”
79790	79802	79803	79803	she	246	“ Roger , let me stay ! Let me nurse you ! ”
79806	79829	79803	79803	she	246	“ I did n't understand . Let me be your friend ! Let me help ! I implore — I implore you ! ”
79848	79854	79855	79855	he	2624	“ What do you mean ? ”
79860	79895	79855	79855	he	2624	“ Do you mean that you wish us to be husband and wife again ? You are , of course , my wife , in the eye of English law , at this moment . ”
79896	79904	79905	79905	she	246	“ Let me try and help you ! ”
79914	79923	79924	79924	He	2624	“ I didn't — I did n't understand ! ”
79929	79959	79926	79926	his	2624	“ You ca n't help me . I — I'm afraid I could n't bear it . We must n't meet . It — it 's gone too deep . ”
79988	79994	79995	79995	he	2624	“ Do n't cry so , ”
80000	80219	80220	80220	he	2637	“ It 's done . We ca n't help it . And do n't make yourself too unhappy about me . I 've had awful times . When I was ill in New York — it was like hell . The pain was devilish , and I was n't used to being alone , and nobody caring a damn , and everybody believing me a cad and a bully . But I got over that . It was Beatty 's death that hit me so hard , and that I was n't there . It 's that , somehow , I ca n't get over — that you did it — that you could have had the heart . It would always come between us . No , we 're better apart . But I 'll tell you something to comfort you . I 've given up that girl , as I 've told you , and I 've given up drink . Herbert wo n't believe it , but he 'll find it is so . And I do n't mean to die before my time . I 'm going out to Switzerland directly . I 'll do all the correct things . You see , when a man knows he 's going to die — well , ”
80224	80238	80220	80220	he	2637	“ he gets uncommonly curious as to what 's going to come next . ”
80252	80287	80248	80248	Daphne	246	“ I 'm not pious — I never was . But after all , the religious people profess to know something about it , and nobody else does . Just supposing it were true ? ”
80307	80361	80362	80362	He	2637	“ Well , anyhow , I 'm going to live decently for the rest of my time — and die decently . I 'm not going to throw away chances . And do n't trouble yourself about money . There 's enough left to carry me through . Good - bye , Daphne ! ”
80385	80409	80410	80410	he	2637	“ Yes , I know , you did n't understand what you were doing . But you see , Daphne , marriage is — ”
80418	80561	80410	80410	he	2637	“ it 's a big thing . If it does n't make us , it ruins us ; I did n't marry you for the best of reasons , but I was very fond of you — honour bright ! I loved you in my way , I should have loved you more and more . I should have been a decent fellow if you 'd stuck to me . I had all sorts of plans ; you might have taught me anything . I was a fool about Chloe Fairmile , but there was nothing in it , you know there was n't . And now it 's all rooted up and done with . Women like to think such things can be mended , but they can't — they ca n't , indeed . It would be foolish to try . ”
80583	80591	80592	80592	he	2638	“ I 'm afraid I must go , ”
80596	80617	80592	80592	he	2638	“ I — I ca n't stand this any longer . Good - bye , Daphne , good - bye . ”
80662	80668	80669	80669	he	2638	“ I 'm going now , ”
80676	80687	80669	80669	he	2638	“ I sha n't come back till you have gone . ”
80766	80773	80774	80774	she	124	“ Oh , you poor thing ! ”
80781	80786	80774	80774	she	124	“ You poor thing ! ”
