3977	4051	3973	3974	the minister	335	" The proof is heavy against you , brother Marner . The money was taken in the night last past , and no man was with our departed brother but you , for William Dane declares to us that he was hindered by sudden sickness from going to take his place as usual , and you yourself said that he had not come ; and , moreover , you neglected the dead body .

You stole the money , and you have woven a plot to lay the sin at my door . But you may prosper , for all that : there is no just God that governs the earth righteously , but a God of lies , that bears witness against the innocent . "

10265	10287	10258	10258	Dunsey	64	" You 're my elders and betters , you know ; I was obliged to come when you sent for me . "
10288	10308	10310	10310	Godfrey	66	" Why , this is what I want — and just shake yourself sober and listen , will you ? "
10335	10472	10314	10314	He	66	" I want to tell you , I must hand over that rent of Fowler 's to the Squire , or else tell him I gave it you ; for he 's threatening to distrain for it , and it 'll all be out soon , whether I tell him or not . He said , just now , before he went out , he should send word to Cox to distrain , if Fowler did n't come and pay up his arrears this week . The Squire 's short o ' cash , and in no humour to stand any nonsense ; and you know what he threatened , if ever he found you making away with his money again . So , see and get the money , and pretty quickly , will you ? "
10473	10476	10478	10478	Dunsey	64	" Oh ! "
10493	10552	10478	10478	Dunsey	64	" Suppose , now , you get the money yourself , and save me the trouble , eh ? Since you was so kind as to hand it over to me , you 'll not refuse me the kindness to pay it back for me : it was your brotherly love made you do it , you know . "
10562	10579	10553	10553	Godfrey	66	" Do n't come near me with that look , else I 'll knock you down . "
10580	10588	10590	10590	Dunsey	64	" O no , you wo n't , "
10600	10722	10590	10590	Dunsey	64	" Because I 'm such a good - natured brother , you know . I might get you turned out of house and home , and cut off with a shilling any day . I might tell the Squire how his handsome son was married to that nice young woman , Molly Farren , and was very unhappy because he could n't live with his drunken wife , and I should slip into your place as comfortable as could be . But , you see , I do n't do it — I'm so easy and good - natured . You 'll take any trouble for me . You 'll get the hundred pounds for me — I know you will . "
10723	10731	10733	10733	Godfrey	66	" How can I get the money ? "
10737	10807	10733	10733	Godfrey	66	" I have n't a shilling to bless myself with . And it 's a lie that you 'd slip into my place : you 'd get yourself turned out too , that 's all . For if you begin telling tales , I 'll follow . Bob 's my father 's favourite — you know that very well . He 'd only think himself well rid of you . "
10808	10812	10814	10814	Dunsey	64	" Never mind , "
10828	10920	10821	10821	he	64	" It ' ud be very pleasant to me to go in your company — you're such a handsome brother , and we 've always been so fond of quarrelling with one another , I should n't know what to do without you . But you 'd like better for us both to stay at home together ; I know you would . So you 'll manage to get that little sum o ' money , and I 'll bid you good - by , though I 'm sorry to part . "
10944	10960	10927	10927	Godfrey	66	" I tell you , I have no money : I can get no money . "
10961	10967	10927	10927	Godfrey	66	" Borrow of old Kimble . "
10968	10988	10927	10927	Godfrey	66	" I tell you , he wo n't lend me any more , and I sha n't ask him . "
10989	10996	10927	10927	Godfrey	66	" Well then , sell Wildfire . "
10997	11012	10927	10927	Godfrey	66	" Yes , that 's easy talking . I must have the money directly . "
11013	11049	10927	10927	Godfrey	66	" Well , you 've only got to ride him to the hunt to - morrow . There 'll be Bryce and Keating there , for sure . You 'll get more bids than one . "
11050	11078	10927	10927	Godfrey	66	" I daresay , and get back home at eight o'clock , splashed up to the chin . I 'm going to Mrs Osgood 's birthday dance . "
11079	11082	11084	11084	Dunsey	64	" Oho ! "
11103	11135	11084	11084	Dunsey	64	" And there 's sweet Miss Nancy coming ; and we shall dance with her , and promise never to be naughty again , and be taken into favour , and — "
11136	11147	11149	11149	Godfrey	66	" Hold your tongue about Miss Nancy , you fool , "
11154	11161	11149	11149	Godfrey	66	" else I 'll throttle you . "
11162	11166	11168	11168	Dunsey	64	" What for ? "
11195	11284	11084	11084	Dunsey	64	" You 've a very good chance . I 'd advise you to creep up her sleeve again : it ' ud be saving time if Molly should happen to take a drop too much laudanum some day , and make a widower of you . Miss Nancy would n't mind being a second , if she did n't know it . And you 've got a good - natured brother , who 'll keep your secret well , because you 'll be so very obliging to him . "
11285	11294	11296	11296	Godfrey	66	" I 'll tell you what it is , "
11304	11468	11296	11296	Godfrey	66	" My patience is pretty near at an end . If you 'd a little more sharpness in you , you might know that you may urge a man a bit too far , and make one leap as easy as another . I do n't know but what it is so now : I may as well tell the Squire everything myself — I should get you off my back , if I got nothing else . And , after all , he 'll know some time . She 's been threatening to come herself and tell him . So , do n't flatter yourself that your secrecy 's worth any price you choose to ask . You drain me of money till I 've got nothing to pacify her with , and she 'll do as she threatens some day . It 's all one . I 'll tell my father everything myself , and you may go to the devil . "
11506	11521	11497	11497	he	64	" As you please ; but I 'll have a draught of ale first . "

11990	12084	11981	11981	Godfrey	66	" to talk about my selling Wildfire in that cool way — the last thing I 've got to call my own , and the best bit of horse - flesh I ever had in my life . And if you 'd got a spark of pride in you , you 'd be ashamed to see the stables emptied , and everybody sneering about it . But it 's my belief you 'd sell yourself , if it was only for the pleasure of making somebody feel he 'd got a bad bargain . "
12085	12090	12092	12092	Dunstan	63	" Ay , ay , "
12097	12174	12092	12092	Dunstan	63	" you do me justice , I see . You know I 'm a jewel for ' ticing people into bargains . For which reason I advise you to let me sell Wildfire . I 'd ride him to the hunt to - morrow for you , with pleasure . I should n't look so handsome as you in the saddle , but it 's the horse they 'll bid for , and not the rider . "
12175	12187	11981	11981	Godfrey	66	" Yes , I daresay — trust my horse to you ! "
12188	12193	12195	12195	Dunstan	63	" As you please , "
12210	12324	12195	12195	Dunstan	63	" It 's you have got to pay Fowler 's money ; it 's none of my business . You received the money from him when you went to Bramcote , and you told the Squire it was n't paid . I 'd nothing to do with that ; you chose to be so obliging as give it me , that was all . If you do n't want to pay the money , let it alone ; it 's all one to me . But I was willing to accommodate you by undertaking to sell the horse , seeing it 's not convenient to you to go so far to - morrow . "
12403	12477	12390	12390	he	66	" Well , you mean no nonsense about the horse , eh ? You 'll sell him all fair , and hand over the money ? If you do n't , you know , everything 'll go to smash , for I 've got nothing else to trust to . And you 'll have less pleasure in pulling the house over my head , when your own skull 's to be broken too . "
12478	12483	12485	12485	Dunstan	63	" Ay , ay , "
12489	12531	12485	12485	Dunstan	63	" all right . I thought you 'd come round . I 'm the fellow to bring old Bryce up to the scratch . I 'll get you a hundred and twenty for him , if I get you a penny . "
12532	12557	12559	12559	Godfrey	66	" But it 'll perhaps rain cats and dogs to - morrow , as it did yesterday , and then you ca n't go , "
12572	12576	12578	12578	Dunstan	63	" Not it , "
12580	12648	12578	12578	Dunstan	63	" I 'm always lucky in my weather . It might rain if you wanted to go yourself . You never hold trumps , you know — I always do . You 've got the beauty , you see , and I 've got the luck , so you must keep me by you for your crooked sixpence ; you 'll ne -ver get along without me . "
12649	12657	12659	12659	Godfrey	66	" Confound you , hold your tongue , "
12663	12694	12659	12659	Godfrey	66	" And take care to keep sober to - morrow , else you 'll get pitched on your head coming home , and Wildfire might be the worse for it . "
12695	12702	12704	12704	Dunstan	63	" Make your tender heart easy , "
12710	12748	12704	12704	Dunstan	63	" You never knew me see double when I 'd got a bargain to make ; it ' ud spoil the fun . Besides , whenever I fall , I 'm warranted to fall on my legs . "

14664	14673	14675	14675	Dunstan	63	" O , I 've swopped with him , "
14703	14709	14636	14636	Bryce	73	" Wildfire 's mine now . "
14710	14727	14729	14729	Bryce	73	" What ! has he swopped with you for that big - boned hack of yours ? "
14742	14753	14755	14755	Dunsey	64	" O , there was a little account between us , "
14759	14906	14755	14755	Dunsey	64	" and Wildfire made it even . I accommodated him by taking the horse , though it was against my will , for I 'd got an itch for a mare o ' Jortin's — as rare a bit o ' blood as ever you threw your leg across . But I shall keep Wildfire , now I 've got him ; though I 'd a bid of a hundred and fifty for him the other day , from a man over at Flitton — he 's buying for Lord Cromleck — a fellow with a cast in his eye , and a green waistcoat . But I mean to stick to Wildfire : I sha n't get a better at a fence in a hurry . The mare 's got more blood , but she 's a bit too weak in the hind - quarters . "
14963	15017	14959	14959	Bryce	73	" I wonder at that now ; I wonder you mean to keep him ; for I never heard of a man who did n't want to sell his horse getting a bid of half as much again as the horse was worth . You 'll be lucky if you get a hundred . "

21589	21676	21571	21572	the landlord	761	" a joke 's a joke . We 're all good friends here , I hope . We must give and take . You 're both right and you 're both wrong , as I say . I agree wi ' Mr Macey here , as there 's two opinions ; and if mine was asked , I should say they 're both right . Tookey 's right and Winthrop 's right , and they 've only got to split the difference and make themselves even . "
21754	21759	21760	21760	he	765	" To be sure , "
21771	21854	21760	21760	he	765	" we 're fond of our old clerk ; it 's nat'ral , and him used to be such a singer , and got a brother as is known for the first fiddler in this country - side . Eh , it 's a pity but what Solomon lived in our village , and could give us a tune when we liked ; eh , Mr Macey ? I 'd keep him in liver and lights for nothing — that I would . "
21855	21860	21862	21863	Mr Macey	41	" Ay , ay , "
21871	21932	21862	21863	Mr Macey	41	" our family 's been known for musicianers as far back as anybody can tell . But them things are dying out , as I tell Solomon every time he comes round ; there 's no voices like what there used to be , and there 's nobody remembers what we remember , if it is n't the old crows . "
21933	21956	21958	21959	the landlord	761	" Ay , you remember when first Mr Lammeter 's father came into these parts , do n't you , Mr Macey ? "
21961	21968	21970	21972	the old man	330	" I should think I did , "
21993	22331	21970	21972	the old man	330	" and a fine old gentleman he was — as fine , and finer nor the Mr Lammeter as now is . He came from a bit north'ard , so far as I could ever make out . But there 's nobody rightly knows about those parts : only it could n't be far north'ard , nor much different from this country , for he brought a fine breed o ' sheep with him , so there must be pastures there , and everything reasonable . We heared tell as he 'd sold his own land to come and take the Warrens , and that seemed odd for a man as had land of his own , to come and rent a farm in a strange place . But they said it was along of his wife 's dying ; though there 's reasons in things as nobody knows on — that 's pretty much what I 've made out ; though some folks are so wise , they 'll find you fifty reasons straight off , and all the while the real reason 's winking at 'em in the corner , and they niver see't . Howsomever , it was soon seen as we 'd got a new parish'ner as know'd the rights and customs o ' things , and kep a good house , and was well looked on by everybody . And the young man — that 's the Mr Lammeter as now is , for he 'd niver a sister — soon begun to court Miss Osgood , that 's the sister o ' the Mr Osgood as now is , and a fine handsome lass she was — eh , you ca n't think — they pretend this young lass is like her , but that 's the way wi ' people as do n't know what come before 'em . I should know , for I helped the old rector , Mr Drumlow as was , I helped him marry 'em . "
22353	22379	22381	22382	the landlord	761	" Ay , and a partic'lar thing happened , did n't it , Mr Macey , so as you were likely to remember that marriage ? "
22389	22401	22403	22404	Mr Macey	41	" I should think there did — a very partic'lar thing , "
22409	22634	22403	22404	Mr Macey	41	" For Mr Drumlow — poor old gentleman , I was fond on him , though he 'd got a bit confused in his head , what wi ' age and wi ' taking a drop o ' summat warm when the service come of a cold morning . And young Mr Lammeter , he 'd have no way but he must be married in Janiwary , which , to be sure , 's a unreasonable time to be married in , for it is n't like a christening or a burying , as you ca n't help ; and so Mr Drumlow — poor old gentleman , I was fond on him — but when he come to put the questions , he put 'em by the rule o ' contrairy , like , and he says , ' Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded wife ? ' says he , and then he says , ' Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded husband ? ' says he . But the partic'larest thing of all is , as nobody took any notice on it but me , and they answered straight off ' yes , ' like as if it had been me saying ' Amen ' i ' the right place , without listening to what went before . "
22635	22660	22662	22663	the butcher	765	" But you knew what was going on well enough , did n't you , Mr Macey ? You were live enough , eh ? "
22665	22670	22672	22673	Mr Macey	41	" Lor bless you ! "
22688	22939	22672	22673	Mr Macey	41	imagination—"why , I was all of a tremble : it was as if I 'd been a coat pulled by the two tails , like ; for I could n't stop the parson , I could n't take upon me to do that ; and yet I said to myself , I says , ' Suppose they should n't be fast married , 'cause the words are contrairy ? ' and my head went working like a mill , for I was allays uncommon for turning things over and seeing all round 'em ; and I says to myself , ' Is't the meanin ' or the words as makes folks fast i ' wedlock ? ' For the parson meant right , and the bride and bridegroom meant right . But then , when I come to think on it , meanin ' goes but a little way i ' most things , for you may mean to stick things together and your glue may be bad , and then where are you ? And so I says to mysen , ' It is n't the meanin ' , it 's the glue . ' And I was worreted as if I 'd got three bells to pull at once , when we got into the vestry , and they begun to sign their names . But where 's the o ' talking ? — you ca n't think what goes on in a ' cute man 's inside . "
22940	22956	22958	22959	the landlord	761	" But you held in for all that , did n't you , Mr Macey ? "
22961	23136	22958	22959	the landlord	761	" Ay , I held in tight till I was by mysen wi ' Mr Drumlow , and then I out wi ' everything , but respectful , as I allays did . And he made light on it , and he says , ' Pooh , pooh , Macey , make yourself easy , ' he says , ' it 's neither the meaning nor the words — it 's the regester does it — that 's the glue . ' So you see he settled it easy ; for parsons and doctors know everything by heart , like , so as they are n't worreted wi ' thinking what 's the rights and wrongs o ' things , as I'n been many and many 's the time . And sure enough the wedding turned out all right , on'y poor Mrs Lammeter — that 's Miss Osgood as was — died afore the lasses were growed up ; but for prosperity and everything respectable , there 's no family more looked on . "
23211	23234	23199	23200	Mr Snell	82	" Why , old Mr Lammeter had a pretty fortin , did n't they say , when he come into these parts ? "
23235	23240	23242	23243	Mr Macey	41	" Well , yes , "
23245	23294	23242	23243	Mr Macey	41	" but I daresay it 's as much as this Mr Lammeter 's done to keep it whole . For there was allays a talk as nobody could get rich on the Warrens : though he holds it cheap , for it 's what they call Charity Land . "
23295	23321	23323	23324	the butcher	765	" Ay , and there 's few folks know so well as you how it come to be Charity Land , eh , Mr Macey ? "
23326	23331	23333	23335	the old clerk	817	" How should they ? "
23341	23821	23333	23335	the old clerk	817	" Why , my grandfather made the grooms ' livery for that Mr Cliff as came and built the big stables at the Warrens . Why , they 're stables four times as big as Squire Cass 's , for he thought o ' nothing but hosses and hunting , Cliff didn't — a Lunnon tailor , some folks said , as had gone mad wi ' cheating . For he could n't ride ; lor bless you ! they said he 'd got no more grip o ' the hoss than if his legs had been cross sticks : my grandfather heared old Squire Cass say so many and many a time . But ride he would , as if old Harry had been a - driving him ; and he 'd a son , a lad o ' sixteen ; and nothing would his father have him do , but he must ride and ride — though the lad was frighted , they said . And it was a common saying as the father wanted to ride the tailor out o ' the lad , and make a gentleman on him — not but what I 'm a tailor myself , but in respect as God made me such , I 'm proud on it , for ' Macey , tailor , ' 's been wrote up over our door since afore the Queen 's heads went out on the shillings . But Cliff , he was ashamed o ' being called a tailor , and he was sore vexed as his riding was laughed at , and nobody o ' the gentlefolks hereabout could abide him . Howsomever , the poor lad got sickly and died , and the father did n't live long after him , for he got queerer nor ever , and they said he used to go out i ' the dead o ' the night , wi ' a lantern in his hand , to the stables , and set a lot o ' lights burning , for he got as he could n't sleep ; and there he 'd stand , cracking his whip and looking at his hosses ; and they said it was a mercy as the stables did n't get burnt down wi ' the poor dumb creaturs in 'em . But at last he died raving , and they found as he 'd left all his property , Warrens and all , to a Lunnon Charity , and that 's how the Warrens come to be Charity land ; though , as for the stables , Mr Lammeter never uses 'em — they're out o ' all charicter — lor bless you ! if you was to set the doors a - banging in 'em , it ' ud sound like thunder half o'er the parish . "
23822	23846	23848	23849	the landlord	761	" Ay , but there 's more going on in the stables than what folks see by daylight , eh , Mr Macey ? "
23851	23868	23870	23871	Mr Macey	41	" Ay , ay ; go that way of a dark night , that 's all , "
23876	24000	23870	23871	Mr Macey	41	" and then make believe , if you like , as you did n't see lights i ' the stables , nor hear the stamping o ' the hosses , nor the cracking o ' the whips , and howling , too , if it 's tow'rt daybreak . ' Cliff 's Holiday ' has been the name of it ever sin ' I were a boy ; that 's to say , some said as it was the holiday Old Harry gev him from roasting , like . That 's what my father told me , and he was a reasonable man , though there 's folks nowadays know what happened afore they were born better nor they know their own business . "
24001	24013	24015	24016	the landlord	761	" What do you say to that , eh , Dowlas ? "
24032	24042	24020	24021	the farrier	768	" There 's a nut for you to crack . "
24060	24176	24043	24044	Mr Dowlas	97	" Say ? I say what a man should say as does n't shut his eyes to look at a finger - post . I say , as I 'm ready to wager any man ten pound , if he 'll stand out wi ' me any dry night in the pasture before the Warren stables , as we shall neither see lights nor hear noises , if it is n't the blowing of our own noses . That 's what I say , and I 've said it many a time ; but there 's nobody ' ull ventur a ten - pun ' note on their ghos'es as they make so sure of . "
24177	24190	24192	24193	Ben Winthrop	87	" Why , Dowlas , that 's easy betting , that is , "
24195	24267	24192	24193	Ben Winthrop	87	" You might as well bet a man as he would n't catch the rheumatise if he stood up to 's neck in the pool of a frosty night . It ' ud be fine fun for a man to win his bet as he 'd catch the rheumatise . Folks as believe in Cliff 's Holiday are n't agoing to ventur near it for a matter o ' ten pound . "
24268	24280	24282	24283	Mr Macey	41	" If Master Dowlas wants to know the truth on it , "
24295	24335	24282	24283	Mr Macey	41	" he 's no call to lay any bet — let him go and stan ' by himself — there 's nobody ' ull hinder him ; and then he can let the parish'ners know if they 're wrong . "
24336	24346	24348	24349	the farrier	768	" Thank you ! I 'm obliged to you , "
24357	24443	24348	24349	the farrier	768	" If folks are fools , it 's no business o ' mine . I do n't want to make out the truth about ghos'es : I know it a'ready . But I 'm not against a bet — everything fair and open . Let any man bet me ten pound as I shall see Cliff 's Holiday , and I 'll go and stand by myself . I want no company . I 'd as lief do it as I 'd fill this pipe . "
24444	24468	24470	24471	the butcher	765	" Ah , but who 's to watch you , Dowlas , and see you do it ? That 's no fair bet , "
24473	24478	24480	24481	Mr Dowlas	97	" No fair bet ? "
24485	24518	24480	24481	Mr Dowlas	97	" I should like to hear any man stand up and say I want to bet unfair . Come now , Master Lundy , I should like to hear you say it . "
24519	24525	24527	24528	the butcher	765	" Very like you would , "
24530	24587	24527	24528	the butcher	765	" But it 's no business o ' mine . You 're none o ' my bargains , and I are n't a - going to try and ' bate your price . If anybody 'll bid for you at your own vallying , let him . I 'm for peace and quietness , I am . "
24588	24608	24610	24611	the farrier	768	" Yes , that 's what every yapping cur is , when you hold a stick up at him , "
24613	24644	24610	24611	the farrier	768	" But I 'm afraid o ' neither man nor ghost , and I 'm ready to lay a fair bet — I are n't a turn - tail cur . "
24645	24657	24659	24660	the landlord	761	" Ay , but there 's this in it , Dowlas , "
24672	24862	24659	24660	the landlord	761	" There 's folks , i ' my opinion , they ca n't see ghos'es , not if they stood as plain as a pike - staff before 'em . And there 's reason i ' that . For there 's my wife , now , ca n't smell , not if she 'd the strongest o ' cheese under her nose . I never see'd a ghost myself , but then I says to myself , ' Very like I have n't got the smell for 'em . ' I mean , putting a ghost for a smell , or else contrairiways . And so , I 'm for holding with both sides ; for , as I say , the truth lies between 'em . And if Dowlas was to go and stand , and say he 'd never seen a wink o ' Cliff 's Holiday all the night through , I 'd back him ; and if anybody said as Cliff 's Holiday was certain sure , for all that , I 'd back him too . For the smell 's what I go by . "
24883	24888	24889	24889	he	768	" Tut , tut , "
24900	24965	24889	24889	he	768	" what 's the smell got to do with it ? Did ever a ghost give a man a black eye ? That 's what I should like to know . If ghos'es want me to believe in 'em , let 'em leave off skulking i ' the dark and i ' lone places — let 'em come where there 's company and candles . "
24966	24982	24984	24985	Mr Macey	41	" As if ghos'es ' ud want to be believed in by anybody so ignirant ! "
25275	25279	25280	25280	he	761	" Master Marner , "
25288	25301	25280	25280	he	761	" what 's lacking to you ? What 's your business here ? "
25302	25305	25307	25307	Silas	38	" Robbed ! "
25311	25334	25307	25307	Silas	38	" I 've been robbed ! I want the constable — and the Justice — and Squire Cass — and Mr Crackenthorp . "
25335	25344	25346	25347	the landlord	761	" Lay hold on him , Jem Rodney , "
25356	25371	25346	25347	the landlord	761	" he 's off his head , I doubt . He 's wet through . "
25397	25415	25417	25417	Jem	40	" Come and lay hold on him yourself , Mr Snell , if you 've a mind , "
25422	25437	25438	25438	he	40	" He 's been robbed , and murdered too , for what I know , "
25446	25450	25452	25452	Silas	38	" Jem Rodney ! "
25465	25479	25481	25481	Jem	40	" Ay , Master Marner , what do you want wi ' me ? "
25498	25507	25509	25509	Silas	38	" If it was you stole my money , "
25524	25563	25518	25518	his	38	" give it me back,—and I wo n't meddle with you . I wo n't set the constable on you . Give it me back , and I 'll let you — I'll let you have a guinea . "
25564	25570	25572	25572	Jem	40	" Me stole your money ! "
25576	25595	25572	25572	Jem	40	" I 'll pitch this can at your eye if you talk o ' my stealing your money . "
25596	25604	25606	25607	the landlord	761	" Come , come , Master Marner , "
25620	25674	25606	25607	the landlord	761	" if you 've got any information to lay , speak it out sensible , and show as you 're in your right mind , if you expect anybody to listen to you . You 're as wet as a drownded rat . Sit down and dry yourself , and speak straight forrard . "
25675	25684	25686	25687	the farrier	768	" Ah , to be sure , man , "
25708	25748	25686	25687	the farrier	768	" Let 's have no more staring and screaming , else we 'll have you strapped for a madman . That was why I did n't speak at the first — thinks I , the man 's run mad . "
25749	25759	25606	25607	the landlord	761	" Ay , ay , make him sit down , "
25875	25900	25865	25866	the landlord	761	" Now then , Master Marner , what 's this you 've got to say , as you 've been robbed ? speak out . "
25901	25915	25917	25918	Jem Rodney	40	" He 'd better not say again as it was me robbed him , "
25922	25947	25917	25918	Jem Rodney	40	" What could I ha ' done with his money ? I could as easy steal the parson 's surplice , and wear it . "
25948	25966	25968	25969	the landlord	761	" Hold your tongue , Jem , and let 's hear what he 's got to say , "
25971	25978	25968	25969	the landlord	761	" Now then , Master Marner . "
26164	26180	26160	26161	Mr Macey	41	" Folks as had the devil to back 'em were not likely to be so mushed "
26306	26321	26323	26324	the landlord	761	" It is n't Jem Rodney as has done this work , Master Marner , "
26326	26409	26323	26324	the landlord	761	" You must n't be a - casting your eye at poor Jem . There may be a bit of a reckoning against Jem for the matter of a hare or so , if anybody was bound to keep their eyes staring open , and niver to wink — but Jem 's been asitting here drinking his can , like the decentest man i ' the parish , since before you left your house , Master Marner , by your own account . "
26410	26415	26417	26418	Mr Macey	41	" Ay , ay , "
26420	26467	26417	26418	Mr Macey	41	" let 's have no accusing o ' the innicent . That is n't the law . There must be folks to swear again ' a man before he can be ta'en up . Let 's have no accusing o ' the innicent , Master Marner . "
26535	26540	26541	26541	he	41	" I was wrong , "
26542	26596	26597	26597	he	41	said—"yes , yes — I ought to have thought . There 's nothing to witness against you , Jem . Only you 'd been into my house oftener than anybody else , and so you came into my head . I do n't accuse you — I wo n't accuse anybody — only , "
26615	26629	26597	26597	he	41	" I try — I try to think where my money can be . "
26630	26650	26652	26653	Mr Macey	41	" Ay , ay , they 're gone where it 's hot enough to melt 'em , I doubt , "
26655	26658	26660	26661	the farrier	768	" Tchuh ! "
26675	26689	26665	26665	he	768	" How much money might there be in the bags , Master Marner ? "
26690	26710	26712	26712	Silas	38	" Two hundred and seventy - two pounds , twelve and sixpence , last night when I counted it , "
26722	26970	26712	26712	Silas	38	" Pooh ! why , they 'd be none so heavy to carry . Some tramp 's been in , that 's all ; and as for the no footmarks , and the bricks and the sand being all right — why , your eyes are pretty much like a insect 's , Master Marner ; they 're obliged to look so close , you ca n't see much at a time . It 's my opinion as , if I 'd been you , or you 'd been me — for it comes to the same thing — you would n't have thought you 'd found everything as you left it . But what I vote is , as two of the sensiblest o ' the company should go with you to Master Kench , the constable's — he 's ill i ' bed , I know that much — and get him to appoint one of us his deppity ; for that 's the law , and I do n't think anybody ' ull take upon him to contradick me there . It is n't much of a walk to Kench 's ; and then , if it 's me as is deppity , I 'll go back with you , Master Marner , and examine your primises ; and if anybody 's got any fault to find with that , I 'll thank him to stand up and say it out like a man . "
27000	27011	27013	27014	the landlord	761	" Let us see how the night is , though , "
27026	27034	27035	27035	he	761	" Why , it rains heavy still , "
27043	27059	27061	27062	the farrier	768	" Well , I 'm not the man to be afraid o ' the rain , "
27064	27090	27061	27062	the farrier	768	" For it 'll look bad when Justice Malam hears as respectable men like us had a information laid before 'em and took no steps . "
27194	27229	27231	27232	Mr Macey	41	" And you 're a doctor , I reckon , though you 're only a cow - doctor — for a fly 's a fly , though it may be a hoss - fly , "
27240	27244	27238	27238	his	768	" ' cuteness . "
27352	27362	27364	27365	the farrier	768	" I do n't want to act the constable , "
27376	27434	27364	27365	the farrier	768	" and there 's no man can say it of me , if he 'd tell the truth . But if there 's to be any jealousy and envying about going to Kench 's in the rain , let them go as like it — you wo n't get me to go , I can tell you . "
27509	27515	27505	27513	those who expect to " watch for the morning	2334	" watch for the morning . "
28056	28060	28062	28063	Mr Tookey—"as	2335	" As if , "
28063	28079	28062	28063	Mr Tookey—"as	2335	Tookey—"as if there was nothing but what could be made out by justices and constables . "
28080	28094	28096	28097	Mr Macey	41	" Now , do n't you be for overshooting the mark , Tookey , "
28106	28191	28096	28097	Mr Macey	41	" That 's what you 're allays at ; if I throw a stone and hit , you think there 's summat better than hitting , and you try to throw a stone beyond . What I said was against the tinder - box : I said nothing against justices and constables , for they 're o ' King George 's making , and it ' ud be ill - becoming a man in a parish office to fly out again ' King George .

28442	28450	28451	28452	Mr Crackenthorp	86	" Did he wear ear - rings ? "
28464	28473	28475	28476	Mr Snell	82	" Well — stay — let me see , "
28531	28594	28520	28520	he	82	" Well , he 'd got ear - rings in his box to sell , so it 's nat'ral to suppose he might wear 'em . But he called at every house , a'most , in the village : there 's somebody else , mayhap , saw 'em in his ears , though I ca n't take upon me rightly to say . "

29302	29319	29277	29277	he	66	" as if it was only Mr Snell who had seen something odd about the pedlar ! "
29671	29693	29655	29655	Bryce	73	" Well , Mr Godfrey , that 's a lucky brother of yours , that Master Dunsey , is n't he ? "
29694	29700	29702	29702	Godfrey	66	" What do you mean ? "
29706	29716	29718	29718	Bryce	73	" Why , has n't he been home yet ? "
29720	29740	29718	29718	Bryce	73	" Home ? no . What has happened ? Be quick . What has he done with my horse ? "
29741	29761	29655	29655	Bryce	73	" Ah , I thought it was yours , though he pretended you had parted with it to him . "
29762	29773	29775	29775	Godfrey	66	" Has he thrown him down and broken his knees ? "
29781	29786	29788	29788	Bryce	73	" Worse than that , "
29790	29877	29788	29788	Bryce	73	" You see , I 'd made a bargain with him to buy the horse for a hundred and twenty — a swinging price , but I always liked the horse . And what does he do but go and stake him — fly at a hedge with stakes in it , atop of a bank with a ditch before it . The horse had been dead a pretty good while when he was found . So he has n't been home since , has he ? "
29878	29883	29885	29885	Godfrey	66	" Home ? no , "
29887	29913	29885	29885	Godfrey	66	" and he 'd better keep away . Confound me for a fool ! I might have known this would be the end of it . "
29914	29923	29925	29925	Bryce	73	" Well , to tell you the truth , "
29927	30005	29925	29925	Bryce	73	" after I 'd bargained for the horse , it did come into my head that he might be riding and selling the horse without your knowledge , for I did n't believe it was his own . I knew Master Dunsey was up to his tricks sometimes . But where can he be gone ? He 's never been seen at Batherley . He could n't have been hurt , for he must have walked off . "
30006	30009	30011	30011	Godfrey	66	" Hurt ? "
30015	30030	30011	30011	Godfrey	66	" He 'll never be hurt — he 's made to hurt other people . "
30031	30046	30048	30048	Bryce	73	" And so you did give him leave to sell the horse , eh ? "
30050	30074	30076	30076	Godfrey	66	" Yes ; I wanted to part with the horse — he was always a little too hard in the mouth for me , "
30098	30120	30121	30121	he	66	" I was going to see after him — I thought some mischief had happened . I 'll go back now , "
30156	30168	30140	30140	he	66	" You 're coming on to Raveloe , are n't you ? "
30169	30177	30179	30179	Bryce	73	" Well , no , not now , "
30181	30267	30179	30179	Bryce	73	" I was coming round there , for I had to go to Flitton , and I thought I might as well take you in my way , and just let you know all I knew myself about the horse . I suppose Master Dunsey did n't like to show himself till the ill news had blown over a bit . He 's perhaps gone to pay a visit at the Three Crowns , by Whitbridge — I know he 's fond of the house . "
30268	30273	30275	30275	Godfrey	66	" Perhaps he is , "
30293	30307	30284	30284	he	66	" We shall hear of him soon enough , I 'll be bound . "
30308	30316	30318	30318	Bryce	73	" Well , here 's my turning , "
30332	30353	30318	30318	Bryce	73	" so I 'll bid you good - day , and wish I may bring you better news another time . "
30584	30595	30596	30596	he	66	" I do n't pretend to be a good fellow , "
30601	30660	30596	30596	he	66	" but I 'm not a scoundrel — at least , I 'll stop short somewhere . I 'll bear the consequences of what I have done sooner than make believe I 've done what I never would have done . I 'd never have spent the money for my own pleasure — I was tortured into it . "
31585	31588	31629	31630	The Squire	531	" betters , "
31698	31711	31684	31684	He	531	" What , sir ! have n't you had your breakfast yet ? "
31747	31752	31754	31754	Godfrey	66	" Yes , sir , "
31756	31772	31754	31754	Godfrey	66	" I 've had my breakfast , but I was waiting to speak to you . "
31773	31778	31780	31781	the Squire	531	" Ah ! well , "
31837	31870	31814	31814	he	531	" Ring the bell for my ale , will you ? You youngsters ' business is your own pleasure , mostly . There 's no hurry about it for anybody but yourselves . "
31968	31982	31983	31983	he	66	" There 's been a cursed piece of ill - luck with Wildfire , "
31986	31993	31983	31983	he	66	" happened the day before yesterday . "
31994	32001	32003	32004	the Squire	531	" What ! broke his knees ? "
32013	32212	32003	32004	the Squire	531	" I thought you knew how to ride better than that , sir . I never threw a horse down in my life . If I had , I might ha ' whistled for another , for my father was n't quite so ready to unstring as some other fathers I know of . But they must turn over a new leaf — they must . What with mortgages and arrears , I 'm as short o ' cash as a roadside pauper . And that fool Kimble says the newspaper 's talking about peace . Why , the country would n't have a leg to stand on . Prices ' ud run down like a jack , and I should never get my arrears , not if I sold all the fellows up . And there 's that damned Fowler , I wo n't put up with him any longer ; I 've told Winthrop to go to Cox this very day . The lying scoundrel told me he 'd be sure to pay me a hundred last month . He takes advantage because he 's on that outlying farm , and thinks I shall forget him . "
32314	32332	32333	32333	he	531	" It 's worse than breaking the horse 's knees — he 's been staked and killed , "
32352	32464	32333	32333	he	531	" But I was n't thinking of asking you to buy me another horse ; I was only thinking I 'd lost the means of paying you with the price of Wildfire , as I 'd meant to do . Dunsey took him to the hunt to sell him for me the other day , and after he 'd made a bargain for a hundred and twenty with Bryce , he went after the hounds , and took some fool 's leap or other , that did for the horse at once . If it had n't been for that , I should have paid you a hundred pounds this morning . "
32524	32541	32543	32543	Godfrey	66	" The truth is , sir — I'm very sorry — I was quite to blame , "
32545	32598	32543	32543	Godfrey	66	" Fowler did pay that hundred pounds . He paid it to me , when I was over there one day last month . And Dunsey bothered me for the money , and I let him have it , because I hoped I should be able to pay it you before this . "
32617	32744	32599	32600	The Squire	531	" You let Dunsey have it , sir ? And how long have you been so thick with Dunsey that you must collogue with him to embezzle my money ? Are you turning out a scamp ? I tell you , I wo n't have it . I 'll turn the whole pack of you out of the house together , and marry again . I 'd have you to remember , sir , my property 's got no entail on it;—since my grandfather 's time the Casses can do as they like with their land . Remember that , sir . Let Dunsey have the money ! Why should you let Dunsey have the money ? There 's some lie at the bottom of it . "
32745	32753	32755	32755	Godfrey	66	" There 's no lie , sir , "
32757	32830	32755	32755	Godfrey	66	" I would n't have spent the money myself , but Dunsey bothered me , and I was a fool and let him have it . But I meant to pay it , whether he did or not . That 's the whole story . I never meant to embezzle money , and I 'm not the man to do it . You never knew me do a dishonest trick , sir . "
32831	32910	32599	32600	The Squire	531	" Where 's Dunsey , then ? What do you stand talking there for ? Go and fetch Dunsey , as I tell you , and let him give account of what he wanted the money for , and what he 's done with it . He shall repent it . I 'll turn him out . I said I would , and I 'll do it . He sha n't brave me . Go and fetch him . "
32911	32920	32755	32755	Godfrey	66	" Dunsey is n't come back , sir . "
32921	32932	32934	32935	the Squire	531	" What ! did he break his own neck then ? "
32956	33002	32934	32935	the Squire	531	" No , he was n't hurt , I believe , for the horse was found dead , and Dunsey must have walked off . I daresay we shall see him again by - and - by . I do n't know where he is . "
33003	33020	33022	33023	the Squire	531	" And what must you be letting him have my money for ? Answer me that , "
33036	33046	33048	33048	Godfrey	66	" Well , sir , I do n't know , "
33095	33128	33130	33131	the Squire	531	" You do n't know ? I tell you what it is , sir . You 've been up to some trick , and you 've been bribing him not to tell , "
33180	33185	33186	33186	he	66	" Why , sir , "
33196	33260	33186	33186	he	66	" it was a little affair between me and Dunsey ; it 's no matter to anybody else . It 's hardly worth while to pry into young men 's fooleries : it would n't have made any difference to you , sir , if I 'd not had the bad luck to lose Wildfire . I should have paid you the money . "
33261	33292	33294	33295	the Squire	531	" Fooleries ! Pshaw ! it 's time you 'd done with fooleries . And I 'd have you know , sir , you must ha ' done with 'em , "
33307	33404	33294	33295	the Squire	531	" Your goings - on are not what I shall find money for any longer . There 's my grandfather had his stables full o ' horses , and kept a good house too , and in worse times , by what I can make out ; and so might I , if I had n't four good - for - nothing fellows to hang on me like horse - leeches . I 've been too good a father to you all — that 's what it is . But I shall pull up , sir . "
33492	33516	34085	34086	the Squire	531	" It 'll be all the worse for you , you know — you 'd need try and help me keep things together . "
33517	33557	33576	33588	the Squire , whose memory consisted in certain strong impressions unmodified by detail	1044	" Well , sir , I 've often offered to take the management of things , but you know you 've taken it ill always , and seemed to think I wanted to push you out of your place . "
33558	33574	33576	33588	the Squire , whose memory consisted in certain strong impressions unmodified by detail	1044	" I know nothing o ' your offering or o ' my taking it ill , "
33590	33752	33576	33588	the Squire , whose memory consisted in certain strong impressions unmodified by detail	1044	" but I know , one while you seemed to be thinking o ' marrying , and I did n't offer to put any obstacles in your way , as some fathers would . I 'd as lieve you married Lammeter 's daughter as anybody . I suppose , if I 'd said you nay , you 'd ha ' kept on with it ; but , for want o ' contradiction , you 've changed your mind . You 're a shilly - shally fellow : you take after your poor mother . She never had a will of her own ; a woman has no call for one , if she 's got a proper man for her husband . But your wife had need have one , for you hardly know your own mind enough to make both your legs walk one way . The lass has n't said downright she wo n't have you , has she ? "
33753	33756	33758	33758	Godfrey	66	" No , "
33766	33775	33758	33758	Godfrey	66	" but I do n't think she will . "
33776	33807	33576	33588	the Squire , whose memory consisted in certain strong impressions unmodified by detail	1044	" Think ! why , have n't you the courage to ask her ? Do you stick to it , you want to have her — that 's the thing ? "
33808	33819	33821	33821	Godfrey	66	" There 's no other woman I want to marry , "
33825	33905	33821	33821	Godfrey	66	" Well , then , let me make the offer for you , that 's all , if you have n't the pluck to do it yourself . Lammeter is n't likely to be loth for his daughter to marry into my family , I should think . And as for the pretty lass , she would n't have her cousin — and there 's nobody else , as I see , could ha ' stood in your way . "
33906	33920	33922	33922	Godfrey	66	" I 'd rather let it be , please sir , at present , "
33927	33958	33922	33922	Godfrey	66	" I think she 's a little offended with me just now , and I should like to speak for myself . A man must manage these things for himself . "
33959	33994	33821	33821	Godfrey	66	" Well , speak then and manage it , and see if you ca n't turn over a new leaf . That 's what a man must do when he thinks o ' marrying . "
33995	34060	33821	33821	Godfrey	66	" I do n't see how I can think of it at present , sir . You would n't like to settle me on one of the farms , I suppose , and I do n't think she 'd come to live in this house with all my brothers . It 's a different sort of life to what she 's been used to . "
34061	34083	34085	34086	the Squire	531	" Not come to live in this house ? Do n't tell me . You ask her , that 's all , "
34095	34109	34111	34111	Godfrey	66	" I 'd rather let the thing be , at present , sir , "
34113	34128	34111	34111	Godfrey	66	" I hope you wo n't try to hurry it on by saying anything . "
34129	34137	34139	34140	the Squire	531	" I shall do what I choose , "
34142	34275	34139	34140	the Squire	531	" and I shall let you know I 'm master ; else you may turn out and find an estate to drop into somewhere else . Go out and tell Winthrop not to go to Cox 's , but wait for me . And tell 'em to get my horse saddled . And stop : look out and get that hack o ' Dunsey 's sold , and hand me the money , will you ? He 'll keep no more hacks at my expense . And if you know where he 's sneaking — I daresay you do — you may tell him to spare himself the journey o ' coming back home . Let him turn ostler , and keep himself . He sha n't hang on me any more . "
34276	34304	34306	34306	Godfrey	66	" I do n't know where he is , sir ; and if I did , it is n't my place to tell him to keep away , "
34313	34331	34333	34334	the Squire	531	" Confound it , sir , do n't stay arguing , but go and order my horse , "
35904	35909	35903	35907	a " poor mushed creatur	2438	" poor mushed creatur ; "
36129	36166	36120	36120	they	1098	" Well , Master Marner , you 're no worse off nor other poor folks , after all ; and if you was to be crippled , the parish ' ud give you a ' lowance . "
36326	36819	36317	36317	he	41	" Come , Master Marner , why , you 've no call to sit a - moaning . You 're a deal better off to ha ' lost your money , nor to ha ' kep it by foul means . I used to think , when you first come into these parts , as you were no better nor you should be ; you were younger a deal than what you are now ; but you were allays a staring , white - faced creatur , partly like a bald - faced calf , as I may say . But there 's no knowing : it is n't every queer - looksed thing as Old Harry 's had the making of — I mean , speaking o ' toads and such ; for they 're often harmless , like , and useful against varmin . And it 's pretty much the same wi ' you , as fur as I can see . Though as to the yarbs and stuff to cure the breathing , if you brought that sort o ' knowledge from distant parts , you might ha ' been a bit freer of it . And if the knowledge was n't well come by , why , you might ha ' made up for it by coming to church reg'lar ; for , as for the children as the Wise Woman charmed , I 've been at the christening of 'em again and again , and they took the water just as well . And that 's reasonable ; for if Old Harry 's a mind to do a bit o ' kindness for a holiday , like , who 's got anything against it ? That 's my thinking ; and I 've been clerk o ' this parish forty year , and I know , when the parson and me does the cussing of a Ash - Wednesday , there 's no cussing o ' folks as have a mind to be cured without a doctor , let Kimble say what he will . And so , Master Marner , as I was saying — for there 's windings i ' things as they may carry you to the fur end o ' the prayer - book afore you get back to 'em — my advice is , as you keep up your sperrits ; for as for thinking you 're a deep un , and ha ' got more inside you nor ' ull bear daylight , I 'm not o ' that opinion at all , and so I tell the neighbours . For , says I , you talk o ' Master Marner making out a tale — why , its nonsense , that is : it ' ud take a ' cute man to make a tale like that ; and , says I , he looked as scared as a rabbit . "
36923	36938	36940	36941	Mr Macey	41	" Come , Master Marner , have you got nothing to say to that ? "
36952	36955	36957	36957	Marner	38	" Oh , "
36968	36978	36962	36962	his	38	" I thank you — thank you — kindly . "
36979	36993	36995	36996	Mr Macey	41	" Ay , ay , to be sure : I thought you would , "
36998	37011	36995	36996	Mr Macey	41	" and my advice is — have you got a Sunday suit ? "
37012	37015	37017	37017	Marner	38	" No , "
37019	37026	37028	37029	Mr Macey	41	" I doubted it was so , "
37031	37160	37028	37029	Mr Macey	41	" Now , let me advise you to get a Sunday suit : there 's Tookey , he 's a poor creatur , but he 's got my tailoring business , and some o ' my money in it , and he shall make a suit at a low price , and give you trust , and then you can come to church , and be a bit neighbourly . Why you 've never heared me say ' Amen ' since you come into these parts , and I recommend you to lose no time , for it 'll be poor work when Tookey has it all to himself , for I may n't be equil to stand i ' the desk at all , come another winter . "
37185	37255	37181	37181	he	41	" And as for the money for the suit o ' clothes , why , you get a matter of a pound a - week at your weaving , Master Marner , and you 're a young man , eh , for all you look so mushed . Why , you could n't ha ' been five - and - twenty when you come into these parts , eh ? "
37272	37291	37256	37256	Silas	38	" I do n't know ; I ca n't rightly say — it 's a long while since . "

I do n't eat such things myself , for a bit o ' bread 's what I like from one year 's end to the other ; but men 's stomichs are made so comical , they want a change — they do , I know , God help 'em .

38590	38727	38588	38588	Dolly	113	" Ben 's read 'em to me many and many a time , but they slip out o ' my mind again ; the more 's the pity , for they 're good letters , else they would n't be in the church ; and so I prick 'em on all the loaves and all the cakes , though sometimes they wo n't hold , because o ' the rising — for , as I said , if there 's any good to be got , we 've need on it i ' this world — that we have ; and I hope they 'll bring good to you , Master Marner , for it 's wi ' that will I brought you the cakes ; and you see the letters have held better nor common . "
38767	38774	38760	38760	He	38	before—"Thank you — thank you kindly . "
38811	38826	38828	38828	Dolly	113	" Ah , if there 's good anywhere , we 've need of it , "
38849	38914	38839	38839	She	113	" But you did n't hear the church - bells this morning , Master Marner . I doubt you did n't know it was Sunday . Living so lone here , you lose your count , I daresay ; and then , when your loom makes a noise , you ca n't hear the bells , more partic'lar now the frost kills the sound . "
38915	38925	38927	38927	Silas	38	" Yes , I did ; I heard 'em , "
38957	38961	38963	38963	Dolly	113	" Dear heart ! "
38971	39206	38963	38963	Dolly	113	" But what a pity it is you should work of a Sunday , and not clean yourself — if you did n't go to church ; for if you 'd a roasting bit , it might be as you could n't leave it , being a lone man . But there 's the bakehus , if you could make up your mind to spend a twopence on the oven now and then , — not every week , in course — I should n't like to do that myself,—you might carry your bit o ' dinner there , for it 's nothing but right to have a bit o ' summat hot of a Sunday , and not to make it as you ca n't know your dinner from Saturday . But now , upo ' Christmas - day , this blessed Christmas as is ever coming , if you was to take your dinner to the bakehus , and go to church , and see the holly and the yew , and hear the anthim , and then take the sacramen ' , you 'd be a deal the better , and you 'd know which end you stood on , and you could put your trust i ' Them as knows better nor we do , seein ' you 'd ha ' done what it lies on us all to do . "
39301	39306	39307	39307	he	38	" Nay , nay , "
39310	39325	39307	39307	he	38	" I know nothing o ' church . I 've never been to church . "
39326	39329	39331	39331	Dolly	113	" No ! "
39355	39371	39352	39352	she	113	" Could it ha ' been as they 'd no church where you was born ? "
39372	39376	39378	39378	Silas	38	" O yes , "
39398	39424	39352	39352	she	113	" There was churches — a many — it was a big town . But I knew nothing of 'em — I went to chapel . "
39444	39446	39435	39435	she	113	" chapel "
39462	39636	39459	39459	she	113	" Well , Master Marner , it 's niver too late to turn over a new leaf , and if you 've niver had no church , there 's no telling the good it 'll do you . For I feel so set up and comfortable as niver was , when I 've been and heard the prayers , and the singing to the praise and glory o ' God , as Mr Macey gives out — and Mr Crackenthorp saying good words , and more partic'lar on Sacramen ' Day ; and if a bit o ' trouble comes , I feel as I can put up wi'it , for I 've looked for help i ' the right quarter , and gev myself up to Them as we must all give ourselves up to at the last ; and if we'n done our part , it is n't to be believed as Them as are above us ' ull be worse nor we are , and come short o ' Theirn . "
39861	39869	39877	39877	her	301	" O , for shame , Aaron , "
39882	39899	39900	39900	she	301	" why , you do n't want cake again yet awhile . He 's wonderful hearty , "
39907	39943	39900	39900	she	301	sigh—"that he is , God knows . He 's my youngest , and we spoil him sadly , for either me or the father must allays hev him in our sight — that we must . "

40001	40017	40018	40018	Dolly	113	" And he 's got a voice like a bird — you would n't think , "
40022	40077	40018	40018	Dolly	113	" he can sing a Christmas carril as his father 's taught him ; and I take it for a token as he 'll come to good , as he can learn the good tunes so quick . Come , Aaron , stan ' up and sing the carril to Master Marner , come . "
40090	40097	40099	40099	Dolly	113	" O , that 's naughty , "
40103	40122	40099	40099	Dolly	113	" Stan'up , when mother tells you , and let me hold the cake till you 've done . "
40180	40183	40184	40184	he	89	" carril , "
40249	40274	40228	40228	he	89	" God rest you merry , gentlemen , Let nothing you dismay , For Jesus Christ our Saviour Was born on Christmas - day . "
40299	40305	40306	40306	she	113	" That 's Christmas music , "
40323	40447	40306	40306	she	113	" There 's no other music equil to the Christmas music—'Hark the erol angils sing . ' And you may judge what it is at church , Master Marner , with the bassoon and the voices , as you ca n't help thinking you 've got to a better place a'ready — for I would n't speak ill o ' this world , seeing as Them put us in it as knows best ; but what wi ' the drink , and the quarrelling , and the bad illnesses , and the hard dying , as I 've seen times and times , one 's thankful to hear of a better . The boy sings pretty , do n't he , Master Marner ? "
40448	40451	40453	40453	Silas	38	" Yes , "
40457	40461	40453	40453	Silas	38	" very pretty . "
40525	40536	40538	40538	Dolly	113	" O , no , thank you , Master Marner , "
40547	40697	40698	40698	Silas	38	" We must be going home now . And so I wish you good - by , Master Marner ; and if you ever feel anyways bad in your inside , as you ca n't fend for yourself , I 'll come and clean up for you , and get you a bit o ' victual , and willing . But I beg and pray of you to leave off weaving of a Sunday , for it 's bad for soul and body — and the money as comes i ' that way'ull be a bad bed to lie down on at the last , if it does n't fly away , nobody knows where , like the white frost . And you 'll excuse me being that free with you , Master Marner , for I wish you well — I do . Make your bow , Aaron . "
40700	40711	40713	40713	he	38	" Good - by , and thank you , kindly , "
41602	41628	41630	41630	Anxiety	117	" Dunsey will be coming home soon : there will be great blow - up , and how will you bribe his spite to silence ? "
41632	41648	41650	41650	Godfrey	66	" O , he wo n't come home before New Year 's Eve , perhaps , "
41652	41678	41650	41650	Godfrey	66	" and I shall sit by Nancy then , and dance with her , and get a kind look from her in spite of herself . "
41679	41688	41690	41690	Anxiety	117	" But money is wanted in another quarter , "
41697	41722	41690	41690	Anxiety	117	" and how will you get it without selling your mother 's diamond pin ? And if you do n't get it . ... ? "
41723	41753	41650	41650	Godfrey	66	" Well , but something may happen to make things easier . At any rate , there 's one pleasure for me close at hand : Nancy is coming . "
41754	41782	41650	41650	Godfrey	66	" Yes , and suppose your father should bring matters to a pass that will oblige you to decline marrying her — and to give your reasons ? "
41783	41817	41690	41690	Anxiety	117	" Hold your tongue , and do n't worry me . I can see Nancy 's eyes , just as they will look at me , and feel her hand in mine already . "
42896	42901	42887	42887	her	121	" After you , ma'am "
42991	43003	42973	42973	She	1229	" Niece , I hope I see you well in health . "
43024	43043	42973	42973	She	1229	" Quite well , I thank you , aunt , and I hope I see you the same . "
43044	43068	42973	42973	She	1229	" Thank you , niece , I keep my health for the present . And how is my brother - in - law ? "

44166	44179	44181	44181	Priscilla	80	" What do you think o ' these gowns , aunt Osgood ? "
44190	44197	44199	44200	Mrs Osgood	52	" Very handsome indeed , niece , "
44217	44325	44209	44209	She	52	" I 'm obliged to have the same as Nancy , you know , for all I 'm five years older and it makes me look yallow ; for she never will have anything without I have mine just like it , because she wants us to look like sisters . And I tell her folks ' ull think it 's my weakness makes me fancy as I shall look pretty in what she looks pretty in . For I am ugly — there 's no denying that : I feature my father 's family . But , law ! I do n't mind , do you ? "
44355	44599	44330	44332	the Miss Gunns	120	" The pretty uns do for fly - catchers — they keep the men off us . I 've no opinion o ' the men , Miss Gunn — I do n't know what you have . And as for fretting and stewing about what they 'll think of you from morning till night , and making your life uneasy about what they 're doing when they 're out o'your sight — as I tell Nancy , it 's a folly no woman need be guilty of , if she 's got a good father and a good home : let her leave it to them as have got no fortin , and ca n't help themselves . As I say , Mr Have - your - own - way is the best husband , and the only one I 'd ever promise to obey . I know it is n't pleasant , when you 've been used to living in a big way , and managing hogsheads and all that , to go and put your nose in by somebody else 's fireside , or to sit down by yourself to a scrag or a knuckle ; but , thank God ! my father 's a sober man and likely to live ; and if you 've got a man by the chimney - corner , it does n't matter if he 's childish — the business need n't be broke up . "
44641	44660	44631	44632	Mrs Osgood	52	" Well , niece , you 'll follow us . The Miss Gunns will like to go down . "
44661	44664	44666	44666	Nancy	67	" Sister , "
44673	44685	44666	44666	Nancy	67	" you 've offended the Miss Gunns , I 'm sure . "
44686	44694	44696	44696	Priscilla	80	" What have I done , child ? "
44702	44720	44696	44696	Priscilla	80	" Why , you asked them if they minded about being ugly — you're so very blunt . "
44721	44809	44666	44666	Nancy	67	" Law , did I ? Well , it popped out : it 's a mercy I said no more , for I 'm a bad un to live with folks when they do n't like the truth . But as for being ugly , look at me , child , in this silver - coloured silk — I told you how it ' ud be — I look as yallow as a daffadil . Anybody ' ud say you wanted to make a mawkin of me . "
44810	44853	44855	44855	Nancy	67	" No , Priscy , do n't say so . I begged and prayed of you not to let us have this silk if you 'd like another better . I was willing to have your choice , you know I was , "
44863	44988	44855	44855	Nancy	67	" Nonsense , child , you know you 'd set your heart on this ; and reason good , for you 're the colour o ' cream . It ' ud be fine doings for you to dress yourself to suit my skin . What I find fault with , is that notion o ' yours as I must dress myself just like you . But you do as you like with me — you always did , from when first you begun to walk . If you wanted to go the field 's length , the field 's length you 'd go ; and there was no whipping you , for you looked as prim and innicent as a daisy all the while . "
44989	44992	44994	44994	Nancy	67	" Priscy , "
45025	45119	44999	44999	she	67	" I 'm sure I 'm willing to give way as far as is right , but who should n't dress alike if it is n't sisters ? Would you have us go about looking as if we were no kin to one another — us that have got no mother and not another sister in the world ? I 'd do what was right , if I dressed in a gown dyed with cheese - colouring ; and I 'd rather you 'd choose , and let me wear what pleases you . "
45120	45183	44999	44999	she	67	" There you go again ! You 'd come round to the same thing if one talked to you from Saturday night till Saturday morning . It 'll be fine fun to see how you 'll master your husband and never raise your voice above the singing o ' the kettle all the while . I like to see the men mastered ! "
45184	45192	45194	45194	Nancy	67	" Do n't talk so , Priscy , "
45198	45210	45194	45194	Nancy	67	" You know I do n't mean ever to be married . "
45211	45222	45224	45224	Priscilla	80	" O , you never mean a fiddlestick 's end ! "
45238	45376	45227	45227	she	80	" Who shall I have to work for when father 's gone , if you are to go and take notions in your head and be an old maid , because some folks are no better than they should be ? I have n't a bit o ' patience with you — sitting on an addled egg for ever , as if there was never a fresh un in the world . One old maid 's enough out o ' two sisters ; and I shall do credit to a single life , for God A'mighty meant me for it . Come , we can go down now . I 'm as ready as a mawkin can be — there 's nothing awanting to frighten the crows , now I 've got my ear - droppers in . "
45661	45665	45688	45688	she	67	" Madam Cass , "

45956	45962	45963	45963	he	66	" Ha , Miss Nancy , "
45980	46015	45963	45963	he	66	" when anybody pretends this has been a severe winter , I shall tell them I saw the roses blooming on New Year 's Eve — eh , Godfrey , what do you say ? "
46280	46285	46286	46286	he	531	" Ay , ay , "
46317	46420	46421	46421	he	1310	" us old fellows may wish ourselves young to - night , when we see the mistletoebough in the White Parlour . It 's true , most things are gone back'ard in these last thirty years — the country 's going down since the old king fell ill . But when I look at Miss Nancy here , I begin to think the lasses keep up their quality;—ding me if I remember a sample to match her , not when I was a fine young fellow , and thought a deal about my pigtail . No offence , to you , madam , "
46434	46450	46426	46427	Mrs Crackenthorp	130	" I did n't know you when you were as young as Miss Nancy here . "
46511	46518	46505	46506	the Squire	531	" O no — no offence . "
46681	46688	46677	46677	his	1315	" breed was stronger than pasture . "
46689	46708	46710	46715	the stout lady of that name	1322	" Miss Nancy 's wonderful like what her mother was , though ; is n't she , Kimble ? "
46908	46918	46920	46922	the authentic doctor	1339	" Did you speak to me , my dear ? "
46954	46985	46951	46951	he	1339	immediately—"Ha , Miss Priscilla , the sight of you revives the taste of that super - excellent pork - pie . I hope the batch is n't near an end . "
46986	46996	46998	46998	Priscilla	80	" Yes , indeed , it is , doctor , "
47000	47026	46998	46998	Priscilla	80	" but I 'll answer for it the next shall be as good . My pork - pies do n't turn out well by chance . "
47027	47049	47051	47052	the Squire	531	" Not as your doctoring does , eh , Kimble ? — because folks forget to take your physic , eh ? "
47108	47122	47124	47125	the doctor	216	" Ah , she has a quick wit , my friend Priscilla has , "
47149	47233	47124	47125	the doctor	216	" She saves a little pepper to sprinkle over her talk — that 's the reason why she never puts too much into her pies . There 's my wife , now , she never has an answer at her tongue 's end ; but if I offend her , she 's sure to scarify my throat with black pepper the next day , or else give me the colic with watery greens . That 's an awful tit - for - tat . "
47243	47251	47253	47254	Mrs Kimble	119	" Did you ever hear the like ? "
47300	47329	47331	47332	the rector	911	" I suppose that 's the sort of tit - for - tat adopted in your profession , Kimble , if you 've a grudge against a patient , "
47334	47344	47346	47347	Mr Kimble	115	" Never do have a grudge against our patients , "
47349	47377	47378	47378	he	115	" except when they leave us : and then , you see , we have n't the chance of prescribing for 'em . Ha , Miss Nancy , "
47388	47408	47378	47378	he	115	" you wo n't forget your promise ? You 're to save a dance for me , you know . "
47409	47423	47425	47426	the Squire	531	" Come , come , Kimble , do n't you be too for'ard , "
47428	47481	47482	47482	he	531	" Give the young uns fair - play . There 's my son Godfrey'll be wanting to have a round with you if you run off with Miss Nancy . He 's bespoke her for the first dance , I 'll be bound . Eh , sir ! what do you say ? "
47494	47508	47482	47482	he	531	" Have n't you asked Miss Nancy to open the dance with you ? "
47565	47591	47603	47603	Nancy	67	" No ; I 've not asked her yet , but I hope she 'll consent — if somebody else has n't been before me . "
47592	47601	47603	47603	Nancy	67	" No , I 've not engaged myself , "
47643	47656	47658	47658	Godfrey	66	" Then I hope you 've no objections to dancing with me , "
47674	47680	47682	47682	Nancy	67	" No , no objections , "
47689	47702	47704	47705	uncle Kimble	115	" Ah , well , you 're a lucky fellow , Godfrey , "
47707	47736	47737	47737	he	115	" but you 're my godson , so I wo n't stand in your way . Else I 'm not so very old , eh , my dear ? "
47749	47772	47737	47737	he	115	" You would n't mind my having a second after you were gone — not if I cried a good deal first ? "
47773	47791	47796	47797	Mrs Kimble	119	" Come , come , take a cup o ' tea and stop your tongue , do , "
47879	47889	47891	47892	the Squire	531	" Why , there 's Solomon in the hall , "
47894	47931	47932	47932	he	531	" and playing my fav'rite tune , I believe — ' The flaxen - headed ploughboy'—he 's for giving us a hint as we are n't enough in a hurry to hear him play . Bob , "
47953	47973	47932	47932	he	531	" open the door , and tell Solomon to come in . He shall give us a tune here . "
48002	48007	48009	48010	the Squire	531	" Here , Solomon , "
48016	48043	48009	48010	the Squire	531	" Round here , my man . Ah , I knew it was ' The flaxen - headed ploughboy : ' there 's no finer tune . "
48124	48176	48111	48111	he	91	" I hope I see your honour and your reverence well , and wishing you health and long life and a happy New Year . And wishing the same to you , Mr Lammeter , sir ; and to the other gentlemen , and the madams , and the young lasses . "
48227	48236	48238	48239	Mr Lammeter	81	" Thank ye , Solomon , thank ye , "
48247	48335	48238	48239	Mr Lammeter	81	" That 's ' Over the hills and far away , ' that is . My father used to say to me , whenever we heard that tune , ' Ah , lad , I come from over the hills and far away . ' There 's a many tunes I do n't make head or tail of ; but that speaks to me like the blackbird 's whistle . I suppose it 's the name : there 's a deal in the name of a tune . "
48352	48358	48238	48239	Mr Lammeter	81	" Sir Roger de Coverley , "
48374	48387	48389	48390	the Squire	531	" Ay , ay , Solomon , we know what that means , "
48394	48418	48389	48390	the Squire	531	" It 's time to begin the dance , eh ? Lead the way , then , and we 'll all follow you . "
49034	49045	49047	49048	Mr Macey	41	" The Squire 's pretty springe , considering his weight , "
49050	49168	49047	49048	Mr Macey	41	" and he stamps uncommon well . But Mr Lammeter beats 'em all for shapes : you see , he holds his head like a sodger , and he is n't so cushiony as most o ' the oldish gentlefolks — they run fat in general ; and he 's got a fine leg . The parson 's nimble enough , but he has n't got much of a leg : it 's a bit too thick down'ard , and his knees might be a bit nearer wi'out damage ; but he might do worse , he might do worse . Though he has n't that grand way o ' waving his hand as the Squire has . "
49169	49180	49182	49183	Ben Winthrop	87	" Talk o ' nimbleness , look at Mrs Osgood , "
49195	49255	49182	49183	Ben Winthrop	87	" She trips along with her little steps , so as nobody can see how she goes — it 's like as if she had little wheels to her feet . She does n't look a day older nor last year : she 's the finest - made woman as is , let the next be where she will . "
49256	49267	49269	49270	Mr Macey	41	" I do n't heed how the women are made , "
49276	49295	49269	49270	Mr Macey	41	" They wear nayther coat nor breeches : you ca n't make much out o ' their shapes . "
49296	49299	49301	49301	Aaron	89	" Fayder , "
49312	49340	49301	49301	Aaron	89	" how does that big cock's - feather stick in Mrs Crackenthorp 's yead ? Is there a little hole for it , like in my shuttlecock ? "
49341	49360	49362	49363	the father	2229	" Hush , lad , hush ; that 's the way the ladies dress theirselves , that is , "
49378	49497	49362	49363	the father	2229	" It does make her look funny , though — partly like a short - necked bottle wi ' a long quill in it . Hey , by jingo , there 's the young Squire leading off now , wi ' Miss Nancy for partners . There 's a lass for you!—like a pink - and - white posy — there 's nobody ' ud think as anybody could be so pritty . I should n't wonder if she 's Madam Cass some day , arter all — and nobody more rightfuller , for they 'd make a fine match . You can find nothing against Master Godfrey 's shapes , Macey , I 'll bet a penny . "
49538	49579	49532	49532	he	41	" Pretty well down'ard , but a bit too round i ' the shoulder - blades . And as for them coats as he gets from the Flitton tailor , they 're a poor cut to pay double money for . "
49580	49593	49595	49595	Ben	87	" Ah , Mr Macey , you and me are two folks , "
49603	49688	49595	49595	Ben	87	" When I 've got a pot o ' good ale , I like to swaller it , and do my inside good , i'stead o ' smelling and staring at it to see if I ca n't find faut wi ' the brewing . I should like you to pick me out a finer - limbed young fellow nor Master Godfrey — one as ' ud knock you down easier , or 's more pleasanter - looksed when he 's piert and merry . "
49689	49692	49694	49695	Mr Macey	41	" Tchuh ! "
49702	49818	49694	49695	Mr Macey	41	" he is n't come to his right colour yet : he 's partly like a slack - backed pie . And I doubt he 's got a soft place in his head , else why should he be turned round the finger by that offal Dunsey as nobody 's seen o ' late , and let him kill that fine hunting hoss as was the talk o ' the country ? And one while he was allays after Miss Nancy , and then it all went off again , like a smell o ' hot porridge , as I may say . That was n't my way , when I went a - coorting . "
49819	49837	49839	49839	Ben	87	" Ah , but mayhap Miss Nancy hung off , like , and your lass did n't , "
49841	49849	49851	49852	Mr Macey	41	" I should say she did n't , "
49856	49912	49851	49852	Mr Macey	41	" Before I said ' sniff , ' I took care to know as she 'd say ' snaff , ' and pretty quick too . I was n't a - going to open my mouth , like a dog at a fly , and snap it to again , wi ' nothing to swaller . "
49913	49927	49929	49929	Ben	87	" Well , I think Miss Nancy 's a - coming round again , "
49931	49980	49929	49929	Ben	87	" for Master Godfrey does n't look so down - hearted to - night . And I see he 's for taking her away to sit down , now they 're at the end o ' the dance : that looks like sweet - hearting , that does . "
50246	50253	50255	50255	Nancy	67	" O no , thank you , "
50269	50302	50255	50255	Nancy	67	" not in there . I 'll wait here till Priscilla 's ready to come to me . I 'm sorry to bring you out of the dance and make myself troublesome . "
50303	50315	50317	50319	the artful Godfrey	66	" Why , you 'll be more comfortable here by yourself , "
50321	50333	50334	50334	He	66	" I 'll leave you here till your sister can come . "
50398	50404	50405	50405	she	67	" Thank you , sir , "
50409	50430	50405	50405	she	67	" I need n't give you any more trouble . I 'm sorry you 've had such an unlucky partner . "
50431	50441	50443	50443	Godfrey	66	" That 's very ill - natured of you , "
50455	50465	50443	50443	Godfrey	66	" to be sorry you 've danced with me . "
50466	50487	50489	50489	Nancy	67	" Oh , no , sir , I do n't mean to say what 's ill - natured at all , "
50497	50513	50489	50489	Nancy	67	" When gentlemen have so many pleasures , one dance can make but very little . "
50514	50541	50443	50443	Godfrey	66	" You know that is n't true . You know one dance with you matters more to me than all the other pleasures in the world . "
50595	50634	50592	50592	she	67	" No , indeed , Mr Godfrey , that 's not known to me , and I have very good reasons for thinking different . But if it 's true , I do n't wish to hear it . "
50635	50686	50687	50687	Godfrey	66	" Would you never forgive me , then , Nancy — never think well of me , let what would happen — would you never think the present made amends for the past ? Not if I turned a good fellow , and gave up everything you did n't like ? "
50757	50773	50774	50774	she	67	" I should be glad to see a good change in anybody , Mr Godfrey , "
50785	50798	50774	50774	she	67	" but it ' ud be better if no change was wanted . "
50799	50809	50811	50811	Godfrey	66	" You 're very hard - hearted , Nancy , "
50815	50837	50811	50811	Godfrey	66	" You might encourage me to be a better fellow . I 'm very miserable — but you 've no feeling . "
50838	50853	50855	50855	Nancy	67	" I think those have the least feeling that act wrong to begin with , "
50916	50930	50909	50909	Priscilla	80	" Dear heart alive , child , let us look at this gown , "
50940	50948	50949	50949	he	66	" I suppose I must go now , "
50954	50967	50969	50971	that frank lady	1402	" It 's no matter to me whether you go or stay , "
50985	50993	50995	50995	Godfrey	66	" Do you want me to go ? "
51011	51016	51018	51018	Nancy	67	" As you like , "
51039	51046	51048	51048	Godfrey	66	" Then I like to stay , "
51970	51973	51986	51986	mammy	140	" mammy , "
53414	53416	53427	53427	Silas	38	" mammy "
53771	53773	53744	53744	he	38	" mammy "
53818	53821	53822	53824	the little one	1432	" Mammy ! "
54517	54536	54509	54509	himself	531	" How 's this ? — what 's this?—what do you do coming in here in this way ? "
54537	54550	54551	54551	Silas	38	" I 'm come for the doctor — I want the doctor , "
54564	54574	54576	54577	the rector	911	" Why , what 's the matter , Marner ? "
54579	54594	54576	54577	the rector	911	" The doctor 's here ; but say quietly what you want him for . "
54595	54601	54603	54603	Silas	38	" It 's a woman , "
54619	54643	54615	54615	Godfrey	66	" She 's dead , I think — dead in the snow at the Stone - pits — not far from my door . "
54712	54717	54719	54720	Mr Crackenthorp	86	" Hush , hush ! "
54722	54751	54752	54752	he	86	" Go out into the hall there . I 'll fetch the doctor to you . Found a woman in the snow — and thinks she 's dead , "
54761	54797	54752	54752	he	86	" Better say as little about it as possible : it will shock the ladies . Just tell them a poor woman is ill from cold and hunger . I 'll go and fetch Kimble . "
54890	54896	54898	54899	several ladies	1516	" What child is it ? "
54915	54936	54909	54910	Nancy Lammeter	67	" I do n't know — some poor woman 's who has been found in the snow , I believe , "
54950	54958	54959	54959	he	66	" After all , am I certain ? "
54974	54990	54995	54996	Mrs Kimble	119	" Why , you 'd better leave the child here , then , Master Marner , "
55016	55029	54995	54996	Mrs Kimble	119	" I 'll tell one o ' the girls to fetch it . "
55030	55049	55051	55051	Silas	38	" No — no — I ca n't part with it , I ca n't let it go , "
55055	55070	55051	55051	Silas	38	" It 's come to me — I 've a right to keep it . "
55118	55126	55128	55129	Mrs Kimble	119	" Did you ever hear the like ? "
55139	55152	55154	55155	Mr Kimble	115	" Now , ladies , I must trouble you to stand aside , "
55191	55205	55207	55208	the Squire	531	" It 's a nasty business turning out now , eh , Kimble ? "
55210	55232	55207	55208	the Squire	531	" He might ha ' gone for your young fellow — the ' prentice , there — what 's his name ? "
55233	55247	55249	55250	uncle Kimble	115	" Might ? ay — what 's the use of talking about might ? "
55265	55311	55207	55208	the Squire	531	" Get me a pair of thick boots , Godfrey , will you ? And stay , let somebody run to Winthrop 's and fetch Dolly — she 's the best woman to get . Ben was here himself before supper ; is he gone ? "
55312	55321	55323	55323	Marner	38	" Yes , sir , I met him , "
55325	55390	55323	55323	Marner	38	" but I could n't stop to tell him anything , only I said I was going for the doctor , and he said the doctor was at the Squire 's . And I made haste and ran , and there was nobody to be seen at the back o ' the house , and so I went in to where the company was . "
55414	55417	55494	55495	uncle Kimble	115	" mammy , "
55454	55459	55460	55460	he	66	" I 'll go , "
55470	55482	55460	55460	he	66	" I 'll go and fetch the woman — Mrs Winthrop . "
55483	55492	55494	55495	uncle Kimble	115	" O , pooh — send somebody else , "
55502	55518	55520	55521	Mr Crackenthorp	86	" You 'll let me know if I can be of any use , Kimble , "
55639	55650	55652	55652	Dolly	113	" You 'd a deal better go back , sir , "
55658	55742	55652	55652	Dolly	113	" You 've no call to catch cold ; and I 'd ask you if you 'd be so good as tell my husband to come , on your way back — he 's at the Rainbow , I doubt — if you found him anyway sober enough to be o ' use . Or else , there 's Mrs Snell ' ud happen send the boy up to fetch and carry , for there may be things wanted from the doctor 's . "
55743	55761	55763	55763	Godfrey	66	" No , I 'll stay , now I 'm once out — I'll stay outside here , "
55773	55786	55763	55763	Godfrey	66	" You can come and tell me if I can do anything . "
55787	55803	55805	55805	Dolly	113	" Well , sir , you 're very good : you 've a tender heart , "
55997	56002	55948	55948	Nancy	67	" Is she dead ? "
56014	56051	55948	55948	Nancy	67	" If she is , I may marry Nancy ; and then I shall be a good fellow in future , and have no secrets , and the child — shall be taken care of somehow . "
56061	56075	56076	56076	Godfrey	66	" She may live , and then it 's all up with me . "
56120	56133	56134	56134	he	115	" I waited for you , as I 'd come so far , "
56140	56183	56134	56134	he	115	" Pooh , it was nonsense for you to come out : why did n't you send one of the men ? There 's nothing to be done . She 's dead — has been dead for hours , I should say . "
56184	56192	56194	56194	Godfrey	66	" What sort of woman is she ? "
56204	56252	56194	56194	Godfrey	66	" A young woman , but emaciated , with long black hair . Some vagrant — quite in rags . She 's got a wedding - ring on , however . They must fetch her away to the workhouse to - morrow . Come , come along . "
56253	56261	56263	56263	Godfrey	66	" I want to look at her , "
56265	56285	56263	56263	Godfrey	66	" I think I saw such a woman yesterday . I 'll overtake you in a minute or two . "
56574	56585	56587	56587	Godfrey	66	" You 'll take the child to the parish tomorrow ? "
56596	56601	56603	56603	Marner	38	" Who says so ? "
56607	56615	56603	56603	Marner	38	" Will they make me take her ? "
56616	56636	56654	56654	Marner	38	" Why , you would n't like to keep her , should you — an old bachelor like you ? "
56637	56652	56654	56654	Marner	38	" Till anybody shows they 've a right to take her away from me , "
56656	56715	56654	56654	Marner	38	" The mother 's dead , and I reckon it 's got no father : it 's a lone thing — and I 'm a lone thing . My money 's gone , I do n't know where — and this is come from I do n't know where . I know nothing — I 'm partly mazed . "
56716	56721	56723	56723	Godfrey	66	" Poor little thing ! "
56725	56735	56736	56736	He	66	" Let me give something towards finding it clothes . "
56772	56786	56787	56787	he	66	" Ah , I see it 's not the same woman I saw , "
56795	56850	56787	56787	he	66	" It 's a pretty little child : the old fellow seems to want to keep it ; that 's strange for a miser like him . But I gave him a trifle to help him out : the parish is n't likely to quarrel with him for the right to keep the child . "
56851	56974	57019	57019	Godfrey	66	" No ; but I 've seen the time when I might have quarrelled with him for it myself . It 's too late now , though . If the child ran into the fire , your aunt 's too fat to overtake it : she could only sit and grunt like an alarmed sow . But what a fool you are , Godfrey , to come out in your dancing shoes and stockings in this way — and you one of the beaux of the evening , and at your own house ! What do you mean by such freaks , young fellow ? Has Miss Nancy been cruel , and do you want to spite her by spoiling your pumps ? "
56975	57017	57019	57019	Godfrey	66	" O , everything has been disagreeable to - night . I was tired to death of jigging and gallanting , and that bother about the horn - pipes . And I 'd got to dance with the other Miss Gunn , "
57539	57543	57538	57542	the " tramp 's child	2725	" tramp 's child "
57618	57623	57607	57608	Notable mothers	1573	" whole and sweet ; "
57776	57782	57784	57784	Dolly	113	" Eh , Master Marner , "
57786	57849	57784	57784	Dolly	113	" there 's no call to buy , no more nor a pair o ' shoes ; for I 've got the little petticoats as Aaron wore five years ago , and it 's ill spending the money on them baby - clothes , for the child ' ull grow like grass i ' May , bless it — that it will . "
57952	57959	57946	57946	she	113	" gug - gug - gug , "
57961	57964	57946	57946	she	113	" mammy . "

58021	58097	58011	58011	Dolly	113	" And to think of its being covered wi ' them dirty rags — and the poor mother — froze to death ; but there 's Them as took care of it , and brought it to your door , Master Marner . The door was open , and it walked in over the snow , like as if it had been a little starved robin . Did n't you say the door was open ? "
58098	58101	58103	58103	Silas	38	" Yes , "
58107	58136	58137	58137	He	38	" Yes — the door was open . The money 's gone I do n't know where , and this is come from I do n't know where . "
58177	58180	58182	58182	Dolly	113	" Ah , "
58188	58397	58182	58182	Dolly	113	" it 's like the night and the morning , and the sleeping and the waking , and the rain and the harvest — one goes and the other comes , and we know nothing how nor where . We may strive and scrat and fend , but it 's little we can do arter all — the big things come and go wi ' no striving o ' our'n — they do , that they do ; and I think you 're in the right on it to keep the little un , Master Marner , seeing as it 's been sent to you , though there 's folks as thinks different . You 'll happen be a bit moithered with it while it 's so little ; but I 'll come , and welcome , and see to it for you : I 've a bit o ' time to spare most days , for when one gets up be - times i ' the morning , the clock seems to stan ' still tow'rt ten , afore it 's time to go about the victual . So , as I say , I 'll come and see to the child for you , and welcome . "
58398	58404	58406	58406	Silas	38	" Thank you ... kindly , "
58412	58426	58427	58427	he	38	" I 'll be glad if you 'll tell me things . But , "
58460	58507	58443	58443	she	143	distance—"But I want to do things for it myself , else it may get fond o ' somebody else , and not fond o ' me . I 've been used to fending for myself in the house — I can learn , I can learn . "
58508	58515	58517	58517	Dolly	113	" Eh , to be sure , "
58521	58584	58586	58586	Dolly	113	" I 've seen men as are wonderful handy wi ' children . The men are awk'ard and contrairy mostly , God help 'em — but when the drink 's out of 'em , they are n't unsensible , though they 're bad for leeching and bandaging — so fiery and unpatient . You see this goes first , next the skin , "
58599	58602	58604	58604	Marner	38	" Yes , "
58645	58649	58651	58651	Dolly	113	" See there , "
58660	58719	58651	58651	Dolly	113	" she 's fondest o ' you . She wants to go o ' your lap , I 'll be bound . Go , then : take her , Master Marner ; you can put the things on , and then you can say as you 've done for her from the first of her coming to you . "
58811	58828	58830	58830	Dolly	113	" There , then ! why , you take to it quite easy , Master Marner , "
58832	58928	58830	58830	Dolly	113	" but what shall you do when you 're forced to sit in your loom ? For she 'll get busier and mischievouser every day — she will , bless her . It 's lucky as you 've got that high hearth i'stead of a grate , for that keeps the fire more out of her reach ; but if you 've got anything as can be spilt or broke , or as is fit to cut her fingers off , she 'll be at it — and it is but right you should know . "
58938	58951	58952	58952	he	38	" I 'll tie her to the leg o ' the loom , "
58955	58966	58952	58952	he	38	last—"tie her with a good long strip o ' something . "
58967	59161	58952	58952	he	38	" Well , mayhap that 'll do , as it 's a little gell , for they 're easier persuaded to sit i ' one place nor the lads . I know what the lads are ; for I 've had four — four I 've had , God knows — and if you was to take and tie 'em up , they 'd make a fighting and a crying as if you was ringing pigs . But I 'll bring you my little chair , and some bits o ' red rag and things for her to play wi ' ; an ' she 'll sit and chatter to 'em as if they was alive . Eh , if it was n't a sin to the lads to wish 'em made different , bless 'em , I should ha ' been glad for one of 'em to be a little gell ; and to think as I could ha ' taught her to scour , and mend , and the knitting , and everything . But I can teach 'em this little un , Master Marner , when she gets old enough . "
59162	59171	59173	59173	Marner	38	" But she 'll be my little un , "
59178	59186	59173	59173	Marner	38	" She 'll be nobody else 's . "
59187	59217	59219	59219	Dolly	113	" No , to be sure ; you 'll have a right to her if you 're a father to her , and bring her up according . But , "
59234	59318	59219	59219	Dolly	113	" you must bring her up like christened folk 's children , and take her to church , and let her learn her catechise , as my little Aaron can say off — the ' I believe , ' and everything , and ' hurt nobody by word or deed , ' — as well as if he was the clerk . That 's what you must do , Master Marner , if you 'd do the right thing by the orphin child . "
59353	59360	59361	59361	she	113	" And it 's my belief , "
59365	59499	59361	59361	she	113	" as the poor little creatur has never been christened , and it 's nothing but right as the parson should be spoke to ; and if you was noways unwilling , I 'd talk to Mr Macey about it this very day . For if the child ever went anyways wrong , and you had n't done your part by it , Master Marner—'noculation , and everything to save it from harm — it ' ud be a thorn i ' your bed for ever o ' this side the grave ; and I ca n't think as it ' ud be easy lying down for anybody when they 'd got to another world , if they had n't done their part by the helpless children as come wi'out their own asking . "
59552	59554	59549	59549	Dolly	113	" christened "
59583	59595	59596	59596	he	38	" What is it as you mean by ' christened ' ? "
59603	59614	59596	59596	he	38	" Wo n't folks be good to her without it ? "
59615	59623	59625	59625	Dolly	113	" Dear , dear ! Master Marner , "
59633	59664	59625	59625	Dolly	113	" Had you never no father nor mother as taught you to say your prayers , and as there 's good words and good things to keep us from harm ? "
59665	59668	59670	59670	Silas	38	" Yes , "
59677	59705	59670	59670	Silas	38	" I know a deal about that — used to , used to . But your ways are different : my country was a good way off . "
59719	59765	59706	59706	He	38	" But I want to do everything as can be done for the child . And whatever 's right for it i ' this country , and you think ' ull do it good , I 'll act according , if you 'll tell me . "
59766	59774	59776	59776	Dolly	113	" Well , then , Master Marner , "
59781	59819	59776	59776	Dolly	113	" I 'll ask Mr Macey to speak to the parson about it ; and you must fix on a name for it , because it must have a name giv ' it when it 's christened . "
59820	59828	59830	59830	Silas	38	" My mother 's name was Hephzibah , "
59832	59842	59830	59830	Silas	38	" and my little sister was named after her . "
59843	59852	59854	59854	Dolly	113	" Eh , that 's a hard name , "
59856	59867	59854	59854	Dolly	113	" I partly think it is n't a christened name . "
59868	59875	59877	59877	Silas	38	" It 's a Bible name , "
59883	59895	59897	59897	Dolly	113	" Then I 've no call to speak again ' it , "
59909	59992	59897	59897	Dolly	113	" but you see I 'm no scholard , and I 'm slow at catching the words . My husband says I 'm allays like as if I was putting the haft for the handle — that 's what he says — for he 's very sharp , God help him . But it was awk'ard calling your little sister by such a hard name , when you 'd got nothing big to say , like — wasn't it , Master Marner ? "
59993	59999	60001	60001	Silas	38	" We called her Eppie , "
60003	60175	60001	60001	Silas	38	" Well , if it was noways wrong to shorten the name , it ' ud be a deal handier . And so I 'll go now , Master Marner , and I 'll speak about the christening afore dark ; and I wish you the best o ' luck , and it 's my belief as it 'll come to you , if you do what 's right by the orphin child ; — and there 's the ' noculation to be seen to ; and as to washing its bits o ' things , you need look to nobody but me , for I can do 'em wi ' one hand when I 've got my suds about . Eh , the blessed angil ! You 'll let me bring my Aaron one o ' these days , and he 'll show her his little cart as his father 's made for him , and the black - and - white pup as he 's got a - rearing . "
60752	60757	60767	60767	she	146	" Dad - dad 's "
60978	60982	61028	61028	Silas	38	" Dad - dad "
61094	61110	61112	61112	Dolly	113	" To be sure , there 's another thing you might do , Master Marner , "
61116	61261	61112	61112	Dolly	113	" you might shut her up once i ' the coal - hole . That was what I did wi ' Aaron ; for I was that silly wi ' the youngest lad , as I could never bear to smack him . Not as I could find i ' my heart to let him stay i ' the coal - hole more nor a minute , but it was enough to colly him all over , so as he must be new washed and dressed , and it was as good as a rod to him — that was . But I put it upo ' your conscience , Master Marner , as there 's one of 'em you must choose — ayther smacking or the coal - hole — else she 'll get so masterful , there 'll be no holding her . "
61473	61476	61465	61465	Silas	38	" setting up "
61739	61742	61722	61722	Silas	38	" Eppie ! "
62094	62099	62088	62088	he	38	" make her remember . "
62139	62145	62146	62146	he	38	" Naughty , naughty Eppie , "
62163	62196	62146	62146	he	38	clothes—"naughty to cut with the scissors , and run away . Eppie must go into the coal - hole for being naughty . Daddy must put her in the coal - hole . "
62287	62292	62294	62294	Silas	38	" Opy , opy ! "
62302	62327	62294	62294	Silas	38	" Now Eppie ' ull never be naughty again , else she must go in the coal - hole — a black naughty place . "
62470	62478	62455	62455	she	146	" Eppie in de toal - hole ! "
62498	62507	62508	62508	he	38	" She 'd take it all for fun , "
62513	62560	62508	62508	he	38	" if I did n't hurt her , and that I ca n't do , Mrs Winthrop . If she makes me a bit o ' trouble , I can bear it . And she 's got no tricks but what she 'll grow out of . "
62561	62572	62574	62574	Dolly	113	" Well , that 's partly true , Master Marner , "
62578	62683	62574	62574	Dolly	113	" and if you ca n't bring your mind to frighten her off touching things , you must do what you can to keep 'em out of her way . That 's what I do wi ' the pups as the lads are allays a - rearing . They will worry and gnaw — worry and gnaw they will , if it was one 's Sunday cap as hung anywhere so as they could drag it . They know no difference , God help 'em : it 's the pushing o ' the teeth as sets them on , that 's what it is . "
62963	62980	62942	62942	he	38	" Ah , Master Marner , you 'll be lucky if she takes the measles soon and easy!"—or
62982	63039	62942	62942	he	38	" Why , there is n't many lone men ' ud ha ' been wishing to take up with a little un like that : but I reckon the weaving makes you handier than men as do out - door work — you're partly as handy as a woman , for weaving comes next to spinning . "
63888	63894	63876	63876	their	387	" out of the country , "
64014	64017	64009	64020	a lover who could say " yes , " if he liked	1689	" yes , "
64569	64572	64561	64561	Nancy	67	" father and Priscilla"—and
65035	65056	65058	65058	Eppie	146	" I wish we had a little garden , father , with double daisies in , like Mrs Winthrop 's , "
65068	65119	65058	65058	Eppie	146	" only they say it ' ud take a deal of digging and bringing fresh soil — and you could n't do that , could you , father ? Anyhow , I should n't like you to do it , for it ' ud be too hard work for you . "
65120	65211	65225	65247	the young man in fustian , who was now by Eppie 's side , entering into the conversation without the trouble of formalities	1735	" Yes , I could do it , child , if you want a bit o ' garden : these long evenings , I could work at taking in a little bit o ' the waste , just enough for a root or two o ' flowers for you ; and again , i ' the morning , I could have a turn wi ' the spade before I sat down to the loom . Why did n't you tell me before as you wanted a bit o ' garden ? "
65212	65223	65225	65247	the young man in fustian , who was now by Eppie 's side , entering into the conversation without the trouble of formalities	1735	" I can dig it for you , Master Marner , "
65249	65298	65058	65058	Eppie	146	" It 'll be play to me after I 've done my day 's work , or any odd bits o ' time when the work 's slack . And I 'll bring you some soil from Mr Cass 's garden — he'll let me , and willing . "
65299	65311	65313	65313	Silas	38	" Eh , Aaron , my lad , are you there ? "
65315	65367	65313	65313	Silas	38	" I was n't aware of you ; for when Eppie 's talking o ' things , I see nothing but what she 's a - saying . Well , if you could help me with the digging , we might get her a bit o ' garden all the sooner . "
65368	65378	65380	65380	Aaron	89	" Then , if you think well and good , "
65382	65424	65380	65380	Aaron	89	" I 'll come to the Stone - pits this afternoon , and we 'll settle what land 's to be taken in , and I 'll get up an hour earlier i ' the morning , and begin on it . "
65425	65444	65446	65446	Eppie	146	" But not if you do n't promise me not to work at the hard digging , father , "
65448	65460	65461	65461	she	146	" For I should n't ha ' said anything about it , "
65471	65486	65461	65461	she	146	" only Mrs Winthrop said as Aaron ' ud be so good , and — "
65487	65500	65502	65502	Aaron	89	" And you might ha ' known it without mother telling you , "
65504	65548	65502	65502	Aaron	89	" And Master Marner knows too , I hope , as I 'm able and willing to do a turn o ' work for him , and he wo n't do me the unkindness to anyways take it out o ' my hands . "
65549	65568	65570	65570	Eppie	146	" There , now , father , you wo n't work in it till it 's all easy , "
65572	65665	65570	65570	Eppie	146	" and you and me can mark out the beds , and make holes and plant the roots . It 'll be a deal livelier at the Stone - pits when we 've got some flowers , for I always think the flowers can see us and know what we 're talking about . And I 'll have a bit o ' rosemary , and bergamot , and thyme , because they 're so sweet - smelling ; but there 's no lavender only in the gentlefolks ' gardens , I think . "
65666	65678	65680	65680	Aaron	89	" That 's no reason why you should n't have some , "
65682	65733	65680	65680	Aaron	89	" for I can bring you slips of anything ; I 'm forced to cut no end of 'em when I 'm gardening , and throw 'em away mostly . There 's a big bed o ' lavender at the Red House : the missis is very fond of it . "
65734	65737	65739	65739	Silas	38	" Well , "
65743	65813	65739	65739	Silas	38	" so as you do n't make free for us , or ask for anything as is worth much at the Red House : for Mr Cass 's been so good to us , and built us up the new end o ' the cottage , and given us beds and things , as I could n't abide to be imposin ' for garden - stuff or anything else . "
65814	65825	65827	65827	Aaron	89	" No , no , there 's no imposin ' , "
65829	65932	65827	65827	Aaron	89	" there 's never a garden in all the parish but what there 's endless waste in it for want o ' somebody as could use everything up . It 's what I think to myself sometimes , as there need nobody run short o ' victuals if the land was made the most on , and there was never a morsel but what could find its way to a mouth . It sets one thinking o ' that — gardening does . But I must go back now , else mother ' ull be in trouble as I are n't there . "
65933	65943	65945	65945	Eppie	146	" Bring her with you this afternoon , Aaron , "
65947	65972	65945	65945	Eppie	146	" I should n't like to fix about the garden , and her not know everything from the first — should you , father ? "
65973	65984	65986	65986	Silas	38	" Ay , bring her if you can , Aaron , "
65988	66009	65986	65986	Silas	38	" she 's sure to have a word to say as'll help us to set things on their right end . "
66029	66033	66034	66034	she	146	" O daddy ! "
66060	66098	66099	66099	she	146	" My little old daddy ! I 'm so glad . I do n't think I shall want anything else when we 've got a little garden ; and I knew Aaron would dig it for us , "
66106	66113	66099	66099	she	146	" I knew that very well . "
66114	66125	66127	66127	Silas	38	" You 're a deep little puss , you are , "
66143	66155	66127	66127	Silas	38	" but you 'll make yourself fine and beholden to Aaron . "
66156	66164	66166	66166	Eppie	146	" O no , I sha n't , "
66172	66177	66166	66166	Eppie	146	" he likes it . "
66178	66204	66127	66127	Silas	38	" Come , come , let me carry your prayer - book , else you 'll be dropping it , jumping i ' that way . "
66394	66408	66410	66416	the lady - mother of the kitten	1743	" I have done my duty by this feeble creature , you perceive ; "
67105	67151	67091	67091	Eppie	146	" O daddy , you 're wanting to go into the sunshine to smoke your pipe . But I must clear away first , so as the house may be tidy when godmother comes . I 'll make haste — I wo n't be long . "
67181	67187	67091	67091	Eppie	146	" good for the fits ; "
67630	67683	67612	67612	her	113	" And yourn 's the same Bible , you 're sure o ' that , Master Marner — the Bible as you brought wi ' you from that country — it 's the same as what they 've got at church , and what Eppie 's a - learning to read in ? "
67684	67687	67689	67689	Silas	38	" Yes , "
67691	67711	67712	67712	he	38	" every bit the same ; and there 's drawing o ' lots in the Bible , mind you , "
67720	67726	67728	67728	Dolly	113	" O dear , dear , "
67762	67888	67759	67759	she	113	" There 's wise folks , happen , as know how it all is ; the parson knows , I 'll be bound ; but it takes big words to tell them things , and such as poor folks ca n't make much out on . I can never rightly know the meaning o ' what I hear at church , only a bit here and there , but I know it 's good words — I do . But what lies upo ' your mind — it 's this , Master Marner : as , if Them above had done the right thing by you , They 'd never ha ' let you be turned out for a wicked thief when you was innicent . "
67889	67892	67894	67894	Silas	38	" Ah ! "
67906	67995	67894	67894	Silas	38	" that was what fell on me like as if it had been red - hot iron ; because , you see , there was nobody as cared for me or clave to me above nor below . And him as I 'd gone out and in wi ' for ten year and more , since when we was lads and went halves — mine own famil'ar friend , in whom I trusted , had lifted up his heel again ' me , and worked to ruin me . "
67996	68016	68018	68018	Dolly	113	" Eh , but he was a bad un — I ca n't think as there 's another such , "
68020	68141	68018	68018	Dolly	113	" But I 'm o'ercome , Master Marner ; I 'm like as if I 'd waked and did n't know whether it was night or morning . I feel somehow as sure as I do when I 've laid something up though I ca n't justly put my hand on it , as there was a right in what happened to you , if one could but make it out ; and you 'd no call to lose heart as you did . But we 'll talk on it again ; for sometimes things come into my head when I 'm leeching or poulticing , or such , as I could never think on when I was sitting still . "
68174	68178	68179	68179	she	113	" Master Marner , "
68194	68401	68179	68179	she	113	" I 've been sore puzzled for a good bit wi ' that trouble o ' yourn and the drawing o ' lots ; and it got twisted back'ards and for'ards , as I did n't know which end to lay hold on . But it come to me all clear like , that night when I was sitting up wi ' poor Bessy Fawkes , as is dead and left her children behind , God help 'em — it come to me as clear as daylight ; but whether I 've got hold on it now , or can any - ways bring it to my tongue 's end , that I do n't know . For I 've often a deal inside me as 'll niver come out ; and for what you talk o ' your folks in your old country niver saying prayers by heart nor saying 'em out of a book , they must be wonderful cliver ; for if I did n't know ' Our Father , ' and little bits o ' good words as I can carry out o ' church wi'me , I might down o ' my knees every night , but nothing could I say . "
68402	68419	68421	68421	Silas	38	" But you can mostly say something as I can make sense on , Mrs Winthrop , "
68423	68934	68421	68421	Silas	38	" Well , then , Master Marner , it come to me summat like this : I can make nothing o ' the drawing o ' lots and the answer coming wrong ; it ' ud mayhap take the parson to tell that , and he could only tell us i ' big words . But what come to me as clear as the daylight , it was when I was troubling over poor Bessy Fawkes , and it allays comes into my head when I 'm sorry for folks , and feel as I ca n't do a power to help 'em , not if I was to get up i ' the middle o ' the night — it comes into my head as Them above has got a deal tenderer heart nor what I 've got — for I ca n't be anyways better nor Them as made me , and if anything looks hard to me , it 's because there 's things I do n't know on ; and for the matter o ' that , there may be plenty o ' things I do n't know on , for it 's little as I know — that it is . And so , while I was thinking o ' that , you come into my mind , Master Marner , and it all come pouring in:—if I felt i ' my inside what was the right and just thing by you , and them as prayed and drawed the lots , all but that wicked un , if they 'd ha ' done the right thing by you if they could , is n't there Them as was at the making on us , and knows better and has a better will ? And that 's all as ever I can be sure on , and everything else is a big puzzle to me when I think on it . For there was the fever come and took off them as were full - growed , and left the helpless children ; and there 's the breaking o ' limbs ; and them as ' ud do right and be sober have to suffer by them as are contrairy — eh , there 's trouble i ' this world , and there 's things as we can niver make out the rights on . And all as we 've got to do is to trusten , Master Marner — to do the right thing as fur as we know , and to trusten . For if us as knows so little can see a bit o ' good and rights , we may be sure as there 's a good and a rights bigger nor what we can know — I feel it i ' my own inside as it must be so . And if you could but ha ' gone on trustening , Master Marner , you would n't ha ' run away from your fellow - creaturs and been so lone . "
68935	68947	68949	68949	Silas	38	" Ah , but that ' ud ha ' been hard , "
68957	68969	68949	68949	Silas	38	" it ' ud ha ' been hard to trusten then . "
68970	68976	68978	68978	Dolly	113	" And so it would , "
68984	69002	68978	68978	Dolly	113	" them things are easier said nor done ; and I 'm partly ashamed o ' talking . "
69003	69008	69010	69010	Silas	38	" Nay , nay , "
69012	69100	69010	69010	Silas	38	" you 're i ' the right , Mrs Winthrop — you're i ' the right . There 's good i ' this world — I've a feeling o ' that now ; and it makes a man feel as there 's a good more nor he can see , i ' spite o ' the trouble and the wickedness . That drawing o ' the lots is dark ; but the child was sent to me : there 's dealings with us — there 's dealings . "
69773	69776	69777	69777	she	146	" Father , "
69800	69844	69777	69777	she	146	" we shall take the furze bush into the garden ; it 'll come into the corner , and just against it I 'll put snowdrops and crocuses,'cause Aaron says they wo n't die out , but 'll always get more and more . "
69845	69850	69852	69852	Silas	38	" Ah , child , "
69876	69967	69777	69777	she	146	" it would n't do to leave out the furze bush ; and there 's nothing prettier , to my thinking , when it 's yallow with flowers . But it 's just come into my head what we 're to do for a fence — mayhap Aaron can help us to a thought ; but a fence we must have , else the donkeys and things ' ull come and trample everything down . And fencing 's hard to be got at , by what I can make out . "
69968	69978	69980	69980	Eppie	146	" O , I 'll tell you , daddy , "
69993	70044	69777	69777	she	146	" There 's lots o ' loose stones about , some of 'em not big , and we might lay 'em atop of one another and make a wall . You and me could carry the smallest , and Aaron ' ud carry the rest — I know he would . "
70045	70052	70054	70054	Silas	38	" Eh , my precious un , "
70056	70099	70100	70100	he	38	" there is n't enough stones to go all round ; and as for you carrying , why , wi ' your little arms you could n't carry a stone no bigger than a turnip . You 're dillicate made , my dear "
70106	70113	69777	69777	she	146	intonation—"that 's what Mrs Winthrop says . "
70114	70126	70128	70128	Eppie	146	" O , I 'm stronger than you think , daddy , "
70130	70181	70128	70128	Eppie	146	" and if there was n't stones enough to go all round , why they 'll go part o ' the way , and then it 'll be easier to get sticks and things for the rest . See here , round the big pit , what a many stones ! "
70208	70219	70220	70220	she	146	" O , father , just come and look here , "
70221	70243	70128	70128	Eppie	146	exclaimed—"come and see how the water 's gone down since yesterday . Why , yesterday the pit was ever so full ! "
70244	70251	70253	70253	Silas	38	" Well , to be sure , "
70260	70354	70253	70253	Silas	38	" Why , that 's the draining they 've begun on , since harvest , i ' Mr Osgood 's fields , I reckon . The foreman said to me the other day , when I passed by 'em , ' Master Marner , ' he said , ' I should n't wonder if we lay your bit o ' waste as dry as a bone . ' It was Mr Godfrey Cass , he said , had gone into the draining : he 'd been taking these fields o ' Mr Osgood . "
70355	70369	70371	70371	Eppie	146	" How odd it 'll seem to have the old pit dried up , "
70385	70397	70398	70398	she	146	" See , daddy , I can carry this quite well , "
70417	70429	70431	70431	Silas	38	" Ah , you 're fine and strong , arn't you ? "
70442	70492	70493	70493	Silas	38	" Come , come , let us go and sit down on the bank against the stile there , and have no more lifting . You might hurt yourself , child . You 'd need have somebody to work for you — and my arm is n't over strong . "
70585	70588	70590	70590	Eppie	146	" Father , "
70606	70625	70590	70590	Eppie	146	" if I was to be married , ought I to be married with my mother 's ring ? "
70658	70672	70717	70717	he	38	" Why , Eppie , have you been a - thinking on it ? "
70673	70681	70683	70683	Eppie	146	" Only this last week , father , "
70687	70696	70683	70683	Eppie	146	" since Aaron talked to me about it . "
70697	70704	70706	70706	Silas	38	" And what did he say ? "
70736	70807	70717	70717	he	38	" He said he should like to be married , because he was a - going in four - and - twenty , and had got a deal of gardening work , now Mr Mott 's given up ; and he goes twice a - week regular to Mr Cass 's , and once to Mr Osgood 's , and they 're going to take him on at the Rectory . "
70808	70820	70822	70822	Silas	38	" And who is it as he 's wanting to marry ? "
70830	70841	70843	70843	Eppie	146	" Why , me , to be sure , daddy , "
70855	70866	70843	70843	Eppie	146	" as if he 'd want to marry anybody else ! "
70867	70878	70880	70880	Silas	38	" And you mean to have him , do you ? "
70882	70888	70890	70890	Eppie	146	" Yes , some time , "
70892	70932	70890	70890	Eppie	146	" I do n't know when . Everybody 's married some time , Aaron says . But I told him that was n't true : for , I said , look at father — he 's never been married . "
70933	70938	70940	70940	Silas	38	" No , child , "
70942	70956	70940	70940	Silas	38	" your father was a lone man till you was sent to him . "
70957	70968	70970	70970	Eppie	146	" But you 'll never be lone again , father , "
70974	71062	70970	70970	Eppie	146	" That was what Aaron said — ' I could never think o ' taking you away from Master Marner , Eppie . ' And I said , ' It ' ud be no use if you did , Aaron . ' And he wants us all to live together , so as you need n't work a bit , father , only what 's for your own pleasure ; and he 'd be as good as a son to you — that was what he said . "
71063	71072	71074	71074	Silas	38	" And should you like that , Eppie ? "
71080	71089	71091	71091	Eppie	146	" I should n't mind it , father , "
71096	71169	71091	71091	Eppie	146	" And I should like things to be so as you need n't work much . But if it was n't for that , I 'd sooner things did n't change . I 'm very happy : I like Aaron to be fond of me , and come and see us often , and behave pretty to you — he always does behave pretty to you , does n't he , father ? "
71170	71180	71182	71182	Silas	38	" Yes , child , nobody could behave better , "
71186	71194	71182	71182	Silas	38	" He 's his mother 's lad . "
71195	71204	71206	71206	Eppie	146	" But I do n't want any change , "
71208	71273	71206	71206	Eppie	146	" I should like to go on a long , long while , just as we are . Only Aaron does want a change ; and he made me cry a bit — only a bit — because he said I did n't care for him , for if I cared for him I should want us to be married , as he did . "
71274	71281	71283	71283	Silas	38	" Eh , my blessed child , "
71301	71472	71473	71473	Silas	38	" you 're o'er young to be married . We 'll ask Mrs Winthrop — we'll ask Aaron 's mother what she thinks : if there 's a right thing to do , she 'll come at it . But there 's this to be thought on , Eppie : things will change , whether we like it or not ; things wo n't go on for a long while just as they are and no difference . I shall get older and helplesser , and be a burden on you , belike , if I do n't go away from you altogether . Not as I mean you 'd think me a burden — I know you wouldn't — but it ' ud be hard upon you ; and when I look for'ard to that , I like to think as you 'd have somebody else besides me — somebody young and strong , as 'll outlast your own life , and take care on you to the end . "
71499	71512	71514	71514	Eppie	146	" Then , would you like me to be married , father ? "
71524	71537	71539	71539	Silas	38	" I 'll not be the man to say no , Eppie , "
71543	71566	71539	71539	Silas	38	" but we 'll ask your god - mother . She 'll wish the right thing by you and her son too . "
71567	71573	71575	71575	Eppie	146	" There they come then , "
71577	71599	71601	71601	Eppie	146	" Let us go and meet 'em . O the pipe ! wo n't you have it lit again , father ? "
71611	71616	71618	71618	Silas	38	" Nay , child , "
71620	71649	71618	71618	Silas	38	" I 've done enough for to - day . I think , mayhap , a little of it does me more good than so much at once . "
71968	71973	71975	71975	Nancy	67	" Now , father , "
71977	72009	71975	71975	Nancy	67	" is there any call for you to go home to tea ? May n't you just as well stay with us?—such a beautiful evening as it 's likely to be . "
72039	72048	72049	72049	he	2132	" My dear , you must ask Priscilla , "
72063	72072	72049	72049	he	2132	" She manages me and the farm too . "
72073	72085	72087	72087	Priscilla	80	" And reason good as I should manage you , father , "
72089	72181	72087	72087	Priscilla	80	" else you 'd be giving yourself your death with rheumatism . And as for the farm , if anything turns out wrong , as it ca n't but do in these times , there 's nothing kills a man so soon as having nobody to find fault with but himself . It 's a deal the best way o ' being master , to let somebody else do the ordering , and keep the blaming in your own hands . It'ud save many a man a stroke , I believe . "
72182	72190	72192	72193	her father	1190	" Well , well , my dear , "
72200	72214	72192	72193	her father	1190	" I did n't say you do n't manage for everybody 's good . "
72215	72227	72229	72229	Nancy	67	" Then manage so as you may stay tea , Priscilla , "
72241	72258	72229	72229	Nancy	67	" Come now ; and we 'll go round the garden while father has his nap . "
72259	72389	72192	72193	her father	1190	" My dear child , he 'll have a beautiful nap in the gig , for I shall drive . And as for staying tea , I ca n't hear of it ; for there 's this dairy - maid , now she knows she 's to be married , turned Michaelmas , she 'd as lieve pour the new milk into the pig - trough as into the pans . That 's the way with 'em all : it 's as if they thought the world ' ud be new - made because they 're to be married . So come and let me put my bonnet on , and there 'll be time for us to walk round the garden while the horse is being put in . "
72427	72558	72560	72560	Priscilla	80	" I 'm as glad as anything at your husband 's making that exchange o ' land with cousin Osgood , and beginning the dairying . It 's a thousand pities you did n't do it before ; for it 'll give you something to fill your mind . There 's nothing like a dairy if folks want a bit o ' worrit to make the days pass . For as for rubbing furniture , when you can once see your face in a table there 's nothing else to look for ; but there 's always something fresh with the dairy ; for even in the depths o ' winter there 's some pleasure in conquering the butter , and making it come whether or no . My dear , "
72575	72588	72560	72560	Priscilla	80	" you 'll never be low when you 've got a dairy . "
72589	72594	72596	72596	Nancy	67	" Ah , Priscilla , "
72610	72659	72596	72596	Nancy	67	" but it wo n't make up to Godfrey : a dairy 's not so much to a man . And it 's only what he cares for that ever makes me low . I 'm contented with the blessings we have , if he could be contented . "
72660	72667	72669	72669	Priscilla	80	" It drives me past patience , "
72673	72820	72669	72669	Priscilla	80	" that way o ' the men — always wanting and wanting , and never easy with what they 've got : they ca n't sit comfortable in their chairs when they 've neither ache nor pain , but either they must stick a pipe in their mouths , to make 'em better than well , or else they must be swallowing something strong , though they 're forced to make haste before the next meal comes in . But , joyful be it spoken , our father was never that sort o ' man . And if it had pleased God to make you ugly , like me , so as the men would n't ha ' run after you , we might have kept to our own family , and had nothing to do with folks as have got uneasy blood in their veins . "
72821	72830	72832	72832	Nancy	67	" O do n't say so , Priscilla , "
72843	72917	72836	72836	she	67	" nobody has any occasion to find fault with Godfrey . It 's natural he should be disappointed at not having any children : every man likes to have somebody to work for and lay by for , and he always counted so on making a fuss with 'em when they were little . There 's many another man ' ud hanker more than he does . He 's the best of husbands . "
72918	72924	72926	72926	Priscilla	80	" O , I know , "
72931	72979	72926	72926	Priscilla	80	" I know the way o ' wives ; they set one on to abuse their husbands , and then they turn round on one and praise 'em as if they wanted to sell 'em . But father'll be waiting for me ; we must turn now . "
73025	73037	73039	73041	the old gentleman	2132	" I always would have a good horse , you know , "
73059	73076	73078	73078	Priscilla	80	" Mind you bring Nancy to the Warrens before the week 's out , Mr Cass , "
73102	73126	73128	73128	Godfrey	66	" I shall just take a turn to the fields against the Stone - pits , Nancy , and look at the draining , "
73130	73143	73128	73128	Godfrey	66	" You 'll be in again by tea - time , dear ? "
73144	73156	73159	73159	Godfrey	66	" O yes , I shall be back in an hour . "
73557	73571	73612	73612	Nancy	67	" I can do so little — have I done it all well ? "
73721	73732	73738	73739	a wife	1839	" A man must have so much on his mind , "
73964	74026	74063	74063	she	67	" It was very different — it was much worse for a man to be disappointed in that way : a woman could always be satisfied with devoting herself to her husband , but a man wanted something that would make him look forward more — and sitting by the fire was so much duller to him than to a woman . "
74317	74327	74309	74309	she	67	" it was right for sisters to dress alike , "
74330	74348	74309	74309	she	67	" she would do what was right if she wore a gown dyed with cheese - colouring . "
74603	74616	74618	74618	Godfrey	66	" But why should you think the child would turn out ill ? "
74624	74681	74618	74618	Godfrey	66	" She has thriven as well as child can do with the weaver ; and he adopted her . There is n't such a pretty little girl anywhere else in the parish , or one fitter for the station we could give her . Where can be the likelihood of her being a curse to anybody ? "
74682	74689	74691	74691	Nancy	67	" Yes , my dear Godfrey , "
74712	74840	74691	74691	Nancy	67	" The child may not turn out ill with the weaver . But , then , he did n't go to seek her , as we should be doing . It will be wrong : I feel sure it will . Do n't you remember what that lady we met at the Royston Baths told us about the child her sister adopted ? That was the only adopting I ever heard of : and the child was transported when it was twentythree . Dear Godfrey , do n't ask me to do what I know is wrong : I should never be happy again . I know it 's very hard for you — it 's easier for me — but it 's the will of Providence . "
75245	75250	75251	75251	she	67	" I was right , "
75264	75422	75251	75251	she	67	discussion—"I feel I was right to say him nay , though it hurt me more than anything ; but how good Godfrey has been about it ! Many men would have been very angry with me for standing out against their wishes ; and they might have thrown out that they 'd had ill - luck in marrying me ; but Godfrey has never been the man to say me an unkind word . It 's only what he ca n't hide : everything seems so blank to him , I know ; and the land — what a difference it ' ud make to him , when he goes to see after things , if he 'd children growing up that he was doing it all for ! But I wo n't murmur ; and perhaps if he 'd married a woman who 'd have had children , she 'd have vexed him in other ways . "
75986	76002	76003	76003	she	67	" I wonder if he 'll mind it less or more as he gets older , "
76006	76072	76003	76003	she	67	" I 'm afraid more . Aged people feel the miss of children : what would father do without Priscilla ? And if I die , Godfrey will be very lonely — not holding together with his brothers much . But I wo n't be over - anxious , and trying to make things out beforehand : I must do my best for the present . "
76141	76152	76138	76138	her	163	" Is your master come into the yard , Jane ? "
76153	76162	76164	76164	Jane	163	" No ' m , he is n't , "
76182	76196	76198	76198	Jane	163	" I do n't know whether you 've seen 'em , ' m , "
76204	76274	76198	76198	Jane	163	" but there 's folks making haste all one way , afore the front window . I doubt something 's happened . There 's niver a man to be seen i ' the yard , else I 'd send and see . I 've been up into the top attic , but there 's no seeing anything for trees . I hope nobody 's hurt , that 's all . "
76275	76289	76291	76291	Nancy	67	" O , no , I daresay there 's nothing much the matter , "
76293	76310	76291	76291	Nancy	67	" It 's perhaps Mr Snell 's bull got out again , as he did before . "
76311	76326	76328	76328	Jane	163	" I wish he may n't gore anybody , then , that 's all , "
76342	76350	76352	76352	Nancy	67	" That girl is always terrifying me , "
76354	76362	76352	76352	Nancy	67	" I wish Godfrey would come in . "
76542	76553	76554	76554	she	67	" Dear , I 'm so thankful you 're come , "
76561	76568	76569	76569	She	67	" I began to get . ... "
76656	76666	76668	76668	Godfrey	66	" Tell her to keep away , will you ? "
76685	76693	76694	76694	he	66	" Sit down , Nancy — there , "
76704	76743	76694	76694	he	66	" I came back as soon as I could , to hinder anybody 's telling you but me . I 've had a great shock — but I care most about the shock it 'll be to you . "
76744	76752	76754	76754	Nancy	67	" It is n't father and Priscilla ? "
76769	76777	76779	76779	Godfrey	66	" No , it 's nobody living , "
76797	76827	76779	76779	Godfrey	66	" It 's Dunstan — my brother Dunstan , that we lost sight of sixteen years ago . We 've found him — found his body — his skeleton . "
76864	76945	76860	76860	He	66	" The Stone - pit has gone dry suddenly — from the draining , I suppose ; and there he lies — has lain for sixteen years , wedged between two great stones . There 's his watch and seals , and there 's my gold - handled hunting - whip , with my name on : he took it away , without my knowing , the day he went hunting on Wildfire , the last time he was seen . "
76960	76968	76970	76970	Nancy	67	" Do you think he drowned himself ? "
77003	77010	77012	77012	Godfrey	66	" No , he fell in , "
77036	77046	77033	77033	he	66	" Dunstan was the man that robbed Silas Marner . "
77080	77084	77085	77085	she	67	" O Godfrey ! "
77112	77121	77122	77122	he	66	" There was the money in the pit , "
77125	77166	77122	77122	he	66	" all the weaver 's money . Everything 's being gathered up , and they 're taking the skeleton to the Rainbow . But I came back to tell you : there was no hindering it ; you must know . "
77235	77340	77216	77216	he	66	" Everything comes to light , Nancy , sooner or later . When God Almighty wills it , our secrets are found out . I 've lived with a secret on my mind , but I 'll keep it from you no longer . I would n't have you know it by somebody else , and not by me — I would n't have you find it out after I 'm dead . I 'll tell you now . It 's been ' I will ' and ' I wo n't ' with me all my life — I'll make sure of myself now . "
77369	77372	77374	77374	Godfrey	66	" Nancy , "
77378	77424	77425	77425	He	66	" when I married you , I hid something from you — something I ought to have told you . That woman Marner found dead in the snow — Eppie 's mother — that wretched woman — was my wife : Eppie is my child . "
77469	77480	77482	77482	Godfrey	66	" You 'll never think the same of me again , "
77500	77546	77496	77496	She	67	" I ought n't to have left the child unowned : I ought n't to have kept it from you . But I could n't bear to give you up , Nancy . I was led away into marrying her — I suffered for it . "
77624	77670	77617	77617	her	67	" Godfrey , if you had but told me this six years ago , we could have done some of our duty by the child . Do you think I 'd have refused to take her in , if I 'd known she was yours ? "
77718	77790	77710	77710	she	67	" And — O , Godfrey — if we 'd had her from the first , if you 'd taken to her as you ought , she 'd have loved me for her mother — and you 'd have been happier with me : I could better have bore my little baby dying , and our life might have been more like what we used to think it ' ud be . "
77801	77819	77821	77821	Godfrey	66	" But you would n't have married me then , Nancy , if I 'd told you , "
77847	77887	77821	77821	Godfrey	66	" You may think you would now , but you would n't then . With your pride and your father 's , you 'd have hated having anything to do with me after the talk there 'd have been . "
77888	77945	77957	77957	she	67	" I ca n't say what I should have done about that , Godfrey . I should never have married anybody else . But I was n't worth doing wrong for — nothing is in this world . Nothing is so good as it seems beforehand — not even our marrying was n't , you see . "
77963	77977	77979	77979	Godfrey	66	" I 'm a worse man than you thought I was , Nancy , "
77984	77991	77979	77979	Godfrey	66	" Can you forgive me ever ? "
77992	78041	77821	77821	Godfrey	66	" The wrong to me is but little , Godfrey : you 've made it up to me — you've been good to me for fifteen years . It 's another you did the wrong to ; and I doubt it can never be all made up for . "
78042	78050	78052	78052	Godfrey	66	" But we can take Eppie now , "
78054	78079	78052	78052	Godfrey	66	" I wo n't mind the world knowing at last . I 'll be plain and open for the rest o ' my life . "
78080	78095	78097	78097	Nancy	67	" It 'll be different coming to us , now she 's grown up , "
78104	78138	78097	78097	Nancy	67	" But it 's your duty to acknowledge her and provide for her ; and I 'll do my part by her , and pray to God Almighty to make her love me . "
78139	78165	78052	78052	Godfrey	66	" Then we 'll go together to Silas Marner 's this very night , as soon as everything 's quiet at the Stone - pits . "
78338	78344	78376	78376	She	146	" beauty born of murmuring sound "
78474	78492	78493	78493	he	38	" At first , I 'd a sort o ' feeling come across me now and then , "
78501	78634	78493	78493	he	38	" as if you might be changed into the gold again ; for sometimes , turn my head which way I would , I seemed to see the gold ; and I thought I should be glad if I could feel it , and find it was come back . But that did n't last long . After a bit , I should have thought it was a curse come again , if it had drove you from me , for I 'd got to feel the need o ' your looks and your voice and the touch o ' your little fingers . You did n't know then , Eppie , when you were such a little un — you did n't know what your old father Silas felt for you . "
78635	78643	78645	78645	Eppie	146	" But I know now , father , "
78647	78675	78493	78493	he	38	" If it had n't been for you , they 'd have taken me to the workhouse , and there 'd have been nobody to love me . "
78676	78745	78746	78746	Silas	38	" Eh , my precious child , the blessing was mine . If you had n't been sent to save me , I should ha ' gone to the grave in my misery . The money was taken away from me in time ; and you see it 's been kept — kept till it was wanted for you . It 's wonderful — our life is wonderful . "
78759	78768	78769	78769	he	38	" It takes no hold of me now , "
78772	78818	78769	78769	he	38	ponderingly—"the money does n't . I wonder if it ever could again — I doubt it might , if I lost you , Eppie . I might come to think I was forsaken again , and lose the feeling that God was good to me . "
78898	78909	78911	78912	Mrs Cass	151	" We 're disturbing you very late , my dear , "
78961	78966	78968	78968	Godfrey	151	" Well , Marner , "
78977	79077	78968	78968	Godfrey	151	" it 's a great comfort to me to see you with your money again , that you 've been deprived of so many years . It was one of my family did you the wrong — the more grief to me — and I feel bound to make up to you for it in every way . Whatever I can do for you will be nothing but paying a debt , even if I looked no farther than the robbery . But there are other things I 'm beholden — shall be beholden to you for , Marner . "
79167	79170	79173	79174	Mr Cass	66	" betters , "
79196	79240	79173	79174	Mr Cass	66	" Sir , I 've a deal to thank you for a'ready . As for the robbery , I count it no loss to me . And if I did , you could n't help it : you are n't answerable for it . "
79241	79295	79173	79174	Mr Cass	66	" You may look at it in that way , Marner , but I never can ; and I hope you 'll let me act according to my own feeling of what 's just . I know you 're easily contented : you 've been a hard - working man all your life . "
79296	79303	79305	79305	Marner	38	" Yes , sir , yes , "
79309	79335	79305	79305	Marner	38	" I should ha ' been bad off without my work : it was what I held by when everything else was gone from me . "
79336	79339	79341	79341	Godfrey	66	" Ah , "
79353	79422	79341	79341	Godfrey	66	" it was a good trade for you in this country , because there 's been a great deal of linen - weaving to be done . But you 're getting rather past such close work , Marner : it 's time you laid by and had some rest . You look a good deal pulled down , though you 're not an old man , are you ? "
79423	79437	79439	79439	Silas	38	" Fifty - five , as near as I can say , sir , "
79441	79530	79439	79439	Silas	38	" O , why , you may live thirty years longer — look at old Macey ! And that money on the table , after all , is but little . It wo n't go far either way — whether it 's put out to interest , or you were to live on it as long as it would last : it would n't go far if you 'd nobody to keep but yourself , and you 've had two to keep for a good many years now . "
79531	79536	79538	79538	Silas	38	" Eh , sir , "
79547	79621	79543	79543	Godfrey	66	" I 'm in no fear o ' want . We shall do very well — Eppie and me ' ull do well enough . There 's few working - folks have got so much laid by as that . I do n't know what it is to gentlefolks , but I look upon it as a deal — almost too much . And as for us , it 's little we want . "
79622	79629	79631	79631	Eppie	146	" Only the garden , father , "
79642	79654	79656	79656	Nancy	67	" You love a garden , do you , my dear ? "
79672	79690	79656	79656	Nancy	67	" We should agree in that : I ' give a deal of time to the garden . "
79691	79704	79706	79706	Godfrey	66	" Ah , there 's plenty of gardening at the Red House , "
79729	79842	79706	79706	Godfrey	66	" You 've done a good part by Eppie , Marner , for sixteen years . It ' ud be a great comfort to you to see her well provided for , would n't it ? She looks blooming and healthy , but not fit for any hardships : she does n't look like a strapping girl come of working parents . You 'd like to see her taken care of by those who can leave her well off , and make a lady of her ; she 's more fit for it than for a rough life , such as she might come to have in a few years ' time . "
79888	79898	79899	79899	he	38	" I do n't take your meaning , sir , "
79922	79932	79934	79934	Godfrey	66	" Well , my meaning is this , Marner , "
79943	80106	79934	79934	Godfrey	66	" Mrs Cass and I , you know , have no children — nobody to benefit by our good home and everything else we have — more than enough for ourselves . And we should like to have somebody in the place of a daughter to us — we should like to have Eppie , and treat her in every way as our own child . It would be a great comfort to you in your old age , I hope , to see her fortune made in that way , after you have been at the trouble of bringing her up so well . And it 's right you should have every reward for that . And Eppie , I 'm sure , will always love you and be grateful to you : she 'd come and see you very often , and we should all be on the look - out to do everything we could towards making you comfortable . "
80245	80267	80240	80240	he	1929	" Eppie , my child , speak . I wo n't stand in your way . Thank Mr and Mrs Cass . "
80333	80374	80314	80314	She	146	" Thank you , ma'am — thank you , sir . But I ca n't leave my father , nor own anybody nearer than him . And I do n't want to be a lady — thank you all the same "
80383	80397	80377	80377	Eppie	146	" I could n't give up the folks I 've been used to . "
80588	80650	80578	80578	he	66	" But I have a claim on you , Eppie — the strongest of all claims . It is my duty , Marner , to own Eppie as my child , and provide for her . She is my own child — her mother was my wife . I have a natural claim on her that must stand before every other . "
80710	80715	80716	80716	he	38	" Then , sir , "
80739	80836	80870	80870	Silas	38	perished—"then , sir , why did n't you say so sixteen year ago , and claim her before I 'd come to love her , i'stead o ' coming to take her from me now , when you might as well take the heart out o ' my body ? God gave her to me because you turned your back upon her , and He looks upon her as mine : you 've no right to her ! When a man turns a blessing from his door , it falls to them as take it in . "
80837	80858	80860	80860	Godfrey	66	" I know that , Marner . I was wrong . I 've repented of my conduct in that matter , "
80874	80884	80886	80886	Marner	38	" I 'm glad to hear it , sir , "
80892	80943	80886	80886	Marner	38	" but repentance does n't alter what 's been going on for sixteen year . Your coming now and saying ' I 'm her father ' does n't alter the feelings inside us . It 's me she 's been calling her father ever since she could say the word . "
80944	80959	80961	80961	Godfrey	66	" But I think you might look at the thing more reasonably , Marner , "
80974	81023	80961	80961	Godfrey	66	" It is n't as if she was to be taken quite away from you , so that you 'd never see her again . She 'll be very near you , and come to see you very often . She 'll feel just the same towards you . "
81024	81029	81031	81031	Marner	38	" Just the same ? "
81038	81102	81031	81031	Marner	38	" How 'll she feel just the same for me as she does now , when we eat o ' the same bit , and drink o ' the same cup , and think o ' the same things from one day 's end to another ? Just the same ? that 's idle talk . You 'd cut us i ' two . "
81176	81184	81185	81185	he	66	" I should have thought , Marner , "
81188	81346	81185	81185	he	66	severely—"I should have thought your affection for Eppie would have made you rejoice in what was for her good , even if it did call upon you to give up something . You ought to remember that your own life is uncertain , and that she 's at an age now when her lot may soon be fixed in a way very different from what it would be in her father 's home : she may marry some low working - man , and then , whatever I might do for her , I could n't make her well - off . You 're putting yourself in the way of her welfare ; and though I 'm sorry to hurt you after what you 've done , and what I 've left undone , I feel now it 's my duty to insist on taking care of my own daughter . I want to do my duty . "
81581	81605	81557	81557	he	38	" I 'll say no more . Let it be as you will . Speak to the child . I 'll hinder nothing . "
81697	81700	81660	81660	her	67	" respectability , "
81777	81783	81785	81785	Godfrey	66	" Eppie , my dear , "
81809	81938	81801	81801	she	146	" it 'll always be our wish that you should show your love and gratitude to one who 's been a father to you so many years , and we shall want to help you to make him comfortable in every way . But we hope you 'll come to love us as well ; and though I have n't been what a father should have been to you all these years , I wish to do the utmost in my power for you for the rest of my life , and provide for you as my only child . And you 'll have the best of mothers in my wife — that'll be a blessing you have n't known since you were old enough to know it . "
81939	81951	81953	81953	Nancy	67	" My dear , you 'll be a treasure to me , "
81960	81972	81953	81953	Nancy	67	" We shall want for nothing when we have our daughter . "
82030	82180	82022	82022	she	146	" Thank you , ma'am — thank you , sir , for your offers — they're very great , and far above my wish . For I should have no delight i ' life any more if I was forced to go away from my father , and knew he was sitting at home , a - thinking of me and feeling lone . We 've been used to be happy together every day , and I ca n't think o ' no happiness without him . And he says he 'd nobody i ' the world till I was sent to him , and he 'd have nothing when I was gone . And he 's took care of me and loved me from the first , and I 'll cleave to him as long as he lives , and nobody shall ever come between him and me . "
82181	82190	82192	82192	Silas	38	" But you must make sure , Eppie , "
82197	82240	82192	82192	Silas	38	voice—"you must make sure as you wo n't ever be sorry , because you 've made your choice to stay among poor folks , and with poor clothes and things , when you might ha ' had everything o ' the best . "
82259	82268	82270	82270	Eppie	146	" I can never be sorry , father , "
82272	82351	82270	82270	Eppie	146	" I should n't know what to think on or to wish for with fine things about me , as I have n't been used to . And it ' ud be poor work for me to put on things , and ride in a gig , and sit in a place at church , as ' ud make them as I 'm fond of think me unfitting company for 'em . What could I care for then ? "
82408	82433	82434	82434	she	67	" What you say is natural , my dear child — it 's natural you should cling to those who 've brought you up , "
82439	82489	82434	82434	she	67	" but there 's a duty you owe to your lawful father . There 's perhaps something to be given up on more sides than one . When your father opens his home to you , I think it 's right you should n't turn your back on it . "
82490	82504	82506	82506	Eppie	146	" I ca n't feel as I 've got any father but one , "
82515	82589	82590	82590	she	146	" I 've always thought of a little home where he 'd sit i ' the corner , and I should fend and do everything for him : I ca n't think o ' no other home . I was n't brought up to be a lady , and I ca n't turn my mind to it . I like the working folks , and their houses , and their ways . And , "
82599	82624	82590	82590	she	146	" I 'm promised to marry a working man , as 'll live with father , and help me to take care of him . "
82684	82689	82690	82690	he	66	" Let us go , "
82699	82710	82712	82712	Nancy	67	" We wo n't talk of this any longer now , "
82716	82747	82751	82751	she	67	" We 're your well - wishers , my dear — and yours too , Marner . We shall come and see you again . It 's getting late now . "
82940	82945	82931	82931	he	2414	" That 's ended ! "
82963	83014	82957	82957	she	67	" Yes , I 'm afraid we must give up the hope of having her for a daughter . It would n't be right to want to force her to come to us against her will . We ca n't alter her bringing up and what 's come of it . "
83015	83018	83020	83020	Godfrey	66	" No , "
83037	83128	83032	83032	his	66	speech—"there 's debts we ca n't pay like money debts , by paying extra for the years that have slipped by . While I 've been putting off and putting off , the trees have been growing — it 's too late now . Marner was in the right in what he said about a man 's turning away a blessing from his door : it falls to somebody else . I wanted to pass for childless once , Nancy — I shall pass for childless now against my wish . "
83141	83157	83032	83032	his	66	asked—"You wo n't make it known , then , about Eppie 's being your daughter ? "
83158	83201	83140	83140	she	67	" No — where would be the good to anybody ? — only harm . I must do what I can for her in the state of life she chooses . I must see who it is she 's thinking of marrying . "
83202	83216	83218	83218	Nancy	67	" If it wo n't do any good to make the thing known , "
83241	83279	83218	83218	Nancy	67	" I should be very thankful for father and Priscilla never to be troubled with knowing what was done in the past , more than about Dunsey : it ca n't be helped , their knowing that . "
83280	83316	83318	83318	Godfrey	66	" I shall put it in my will — I think I shall put it in my will . I should n't like to leave anything to be found out , like this of Dunsey , "
83322	83360	83361	83361	he	66	" But I ca n't see anything but difficulties that ' ud come from telling it now . I must do what I can to make her happy in her own way . I 've a notion , "
83370	83395	83361	83361	he	66	" it 's Aaron Winthrop she meant she was engaged to . I remember seeing him with her and Marner going away from church . "
83396	83406	83408	83408	Nancy	67	" Well , he 's very sober and industrious , "
83437	83453	83427	83427	he	66	" She 's a very pretty , nice girl , is n't she , Nancy ? "
83454	83476	83427	83427	he	66	" Yes , dear ; and with just your hair and eyes : I wondered it had never struck me before . "
83477	83506	83427	83427	he	66	" I think she took a dislike to me at the thought of my being her father : I could see a change in her manner after that . "
83507	83523	83525	83525	Nancy	67	" She could n't bear to think of not looking on Marner as her father , "
83537	83638	83525	83525	Nancy	67	" She thinks I did wrong by her mother as well as by her . She thinks me worse than I am . But she must think it : she can never know all . It 's part of my punishment , Nancy , for my daughter to dislike me . I should never have got into that trouble if I 'd been true to you — if I had n't been a fool . I 'd no right to expect anything but evil could come of that marriage — and when I shirked doing a father 's part too . "
83692	83726	83666	83666	He	1964	" And I got you , Nancy , in spite of all ; and yet I 've been grumbling and uneasy because I had n't something else — as if I deserved it . "
83727	83738	83740	83740	Nancy	67	" You 've never been wanting to me , Godfrey , "
83746	83766	83740	83740	Nancy	67	" My only trouble would be gone if you resigned yourself to the lot that 's been given us . "
83767	83797	83812	83812	he	1964	" Well , perhaps it is n't too late to mend a bit there . Though it is too late to mend some things , say what they will . "
83818	83911	83812	83812	he	1964	" Eppie , there 's a thing I 've had on my mind to do this two year , and now the money 's been brought back to us , we can do it . I 've been turning it over and over in the night , and I think we 'll set out to - morrow , while the fine days last . We 'll leave the house and everything for your godmother to take care on , and we 'll make a little bundle o ' things and set out . "
83912	83919	83921	83921	Eppie	146	" Where to go , daddy ? "
83927	84029	83921	83921	Eppie	146	" To my old country — to the town where I was born — up Lantern Yard . I want to see Mr Paston , the minister : something may ha ' come out to make 'em know I was innicent o ' the robbery . And Mr Paston was a man with a deal o ' light — I want to speak to him about the drawing o ' the lots . And I should like to talk to him about the religion o ' this country - side , for I partly think he does n't know on it . "
84165	84184	84277	84277	Silas	38	" You 'd be easier in your mind for the rest o ' your life , Master Marner , "
84186	84233	84277	84277	Silas	38	Dolly—"that you would . And if there 's any light to be got up the yard as you talk on , we 've need of it i ' this world , and I 'd be glad on it myself , if you could bring it back . "
84321	84357	84359	84359	Eppie	146	" Ask for Lantern Yard , father — ask this gentleman with the tassels on his shoulders a - standing at the shop - door ; he is n't in a hurry like the rest , "
84392	84406	84408	84408	Silas	38	" Eh , my child , he wo n't know anything about it , "
84410	84455	84408	84408	Silas	38	" gentlefolks did n't ever go up the Yard . But happen somebody can tell me which is the way to Prison Street , where the jail is . I know the way out o ' that as if I 'd seen it yesterday . "
84520	84523	84524	84524	he	38	" Ah , "
84532	84574	84524	84524	he	38	" there 's the jail , Eppie ; that 's just the same : I are n't afraid now . It 's the third turning on the left hand from the jail doors , that 's the way we must go . "
84575	84584	84586	84586	Eppie	146	" O , what a dark ugly place ! "
84588	84623	84586	84586	Eppie	146	" How it hides the sky ! It 's worse than the Workhouse . I 'm glad you do n't live in this town now , father . Is Lantern Yard like this street ? "
84624	84629	84631	84631	Silas	38	" My precious child , "
84635	84694	84631	84631	Silas	38	" it is n't a big street like this . I never was easy i ' this street myself , but I was fond o ' Lantern Yard . The shops here are all altered , I think — I ca n't make 'em out ; but I shall know the turning , because it 's the third . "
84695	84700	84701	84701	he	38	" Here it is , "
84718	84777	84701	84701	he	38	" And then we must go to the left again , and then straight for'ard for a bit , up Shoe Lane ; and then we shall be at the entry next to the o'erhanging window , where there 's the nick in the road for the water to run . Eh , I can see it all . "
84778	84791	84793	84793	Eppie	146	" O father , I 'm like as if I was stifled , "
84795	84829	84793	84793	Eppie	146	" I could n't ha ' thought as any folks lived i ' this way , so close together . How pretty the Stone - pits ' ull look when we get back ! "
84830	84856	84701	84701	he	38	" It looks comical to me , child , now — and smells bad . I ca n't think as it usened to smell so . "
84909	84913	84915	84915	Silas	38	" Dear heart ! "
84917	84947	84915	84915	Silas	38	" why , there 's people coming out o ' the Yard as if they 'd been to chapel at this time o ' day — a weekday noon ! "
84991	84994	84996	84996	Eppie	146	" Father , "
85002	85008	84996	84996	Eppie	146	" what 's the matter ? "
85023	85030	85031	85031	he	38	" It 's gone , child , "
85039	85094	85031	85031	he	38	agitation—"Lantern Yard 's gone . It must ha ' been here , because here 's the house with the o'erhanging window — I know that — it 's just the same ; but they 've made this new opening ; and see that big factory ! It 's all gone — chapel and all . "
85095	85115	85117	85117	Eppie	146	" Come into that little brush - shop and sit down , father — they'll let you sit down , "
85135	85146	85031	85031	he	38	" Perhaps the people can tell you all about it . "
85201	85211	85212	85212	Silas	38	" The old place is all swep ' away , "
85224	85301	85212	85212	Silas	38	" the little graveyard and everything . The old home 's gone ; I 've no home but this now . I shall never know whether they got at the truth o ' the robbery , nor whether Mr Paston could ha ' given me any light about the drawing o ' the lots . It 's dark to me , Mrs Winthrop , that is ; I doubt it 'll be dark to the last . "
85302	85310	85312	85312	Dolly	113	" Well , yes , Master Marner , "
85328	85428	85312	85312	Dolly	113	" I doubt it may . It 's the will o ' Them above as a many things should be dark to us ; but there 's some things as I 've never felt i ' the dark about , and they 're mostly what comes i ' the day 's work . You were hard done by that once , Master Marner , and it seems as you 'll never know the rights of it ; but that does n't hinder there being a rights , Master Marner , for all it 's dark to you and me . "
85429	85432	85434	85434	Silas	38	" No , "
85436	85492	85434	85434	Silas	38	" no ; that does n't hinder . Since the time the child was sent to me and I 've come to love her as myself , I 've had light enough to trusten by ; and , now she says she 'll never leave me , I think I shall trusten till I die . "
85754	85765	85766	85766	she	146	" You wo n't be giving me away , father , "
85775	85789	85766	85766	she	146	" you 'll only be taking Aaron to be a son to you . "
85931	85953	85955	85955	Priscilla	80	" I could ha ' wished Nancy had had the luck to find a child like that and bring her up , "
85967	85987	85955	85955	Priscilla	80	" I should ha ' had something young to think of then , besides the lambs and the calves . "
85988	85996	85998	85999	Mr Lammeter	81	" Yes , my dear , yes , "
86001	86042	85998	85999	Mr Lammeter	81	" one feels that as one gets older . Things look dim to old folks : they 'd need have some young eyes about 'em , to let 'em know the world 's the same as it used to be . "
86121	86132	86134	86134	Dolly	113	" Mr Macey 's looking for a word from us , "
86136	86156	86134	86134	Dolly	113	" he 'll be hurt if we pass him and say nothing — and him so racked with rheumatiz . "
86183	86189	86190	86190	he	330	" Well , Master Marner , "
86202	86298	86190	86190	he	330	" I 've lived to see my words come true . I was the first to say there was no harm in you , though your looks might be again ' you ; and I was the first to say you 'd get your money back . And its nothing but rightful as you should . And I 'd ha ' said the ' Amens , ' and willing , at the holy matrimony ; but Tookey 's done it a good while now , and I hope you 'll have none the worse luck . "
86619	86623	86625	86625	Eppie	146	" O father , "
86627	86645	86625	86625	Eppie	146	" what a pretty home ours is ! I think nobody could be happier than we are . "
