291	292	288	288	she	253	“ jargon”—“slang
293	311	288	288	she	253	” was too coarse a word for her to apply to slang : she excluded many a good “
314	489	288	288	she	253	” along with the real offenders ; and monosyllables in general ran some risk of ' having to show their passports . If this was pedantry , it went no further ; she was open , free , and youthful with her young pupils ; and had the art to put herself on their level : often , when they were quite young , she would feign infantine ignorance , in order to hunt trite truth in couples with them , and detect , by joint experiment , that rainbows can not , or else will not , be walked into , nor Jack - o'-lantern be gathered like a cowslip ; and that , dissect we the vocal dog — whose hair is so like a lamb's — never so skilfully , no fragment of palpable bark , no sediment of tangible squeak , remains inside him to bless the inquisitive little operator , & c. , & c. When they advanced from these elementary branches to Languages , History , Tapestry , and “
493	1178	288	288	she	253	” she managed still to keep by their side learning with them , not just hearing them lessons down from the top of a high tower of maternity . She never checked their curiosity , but made herself share it ; never gave them , as so many parents do , a white - lying answer ; wooed their affections with subtle though innocent art , thawed their reserve , obtained their love , and retained their respect . Briefly , a female Chesterfield ; her husband 's lover after marriage , though not before ; and the mild monitress the elder sister , the favourite companion and bosom friend of both her children . They were remarkably dissimilar ; and perhaps I may be allowed to preface the narrative of their adventures by a delineation ; as in country churches an individual pipes the keynote , and the tune comes raging after . Edward , then , had a great calm eye , that was always looking folk full in the face , mildly ; his countenance comely and manly , but no more ; too square for Apollo ; but sufficed for John Bull . His figure it was that charmed the curious observer of male beauty . He was five feet ten ; had square shoulders , a deep chest , masculine flank , small foot , high instep . To crown all this , a head , overflowed by ripples of dark brown hair , sat with heroic grace upon his solid white throat , like some glossy falcon new lighted on a Parian column . This young gentleman had decided qualities , positive and negative . He could walk up to a five - barred gate and clear it , alighting on the other side like a fallen feather ; could row all day , and then dance all night ; could fling a cricket ball a hundred and six yards ; had a lathe and a tool - box , and would make you in a trice a chair , a table , a doll , a nutcracker , or any other moveable , useful , or the very reverse . And could not learn his lessons , to save his life . His sister Julia was not so easy to describe . Her figure was tall , lithe , and serpentine ; her hair the colour of a horse - chestnut fresh from its pod ; her ears tiny and shell - like , her eyelashes long and silky ; her mouth small when grave , large when smiling ; her eyes pure hazel by day , and tinged with a little violet by night . But in jotting down these details , true as they are , I seem to myself to be painting fire , with a little snow and saffron mixed on a marble pallet . There is a beauty too spiritual to be chained in a string of items ; and Julia 's fair features were but the china vessel that brimmed over with the higher loveliness of her soul . Her essential charm was , what shall I say ? Transparence . Modesty , Intelligence , and , above all , Enthusiasm , shone through her , and out of her , and made her an airy , fiery , household joy . Briefly , an incarnate sunbeam . This one could learn her lessons with unreasonable rapidity , and until Edward went to Eton , would insist upon learning his into the bargain , partly with the fond notion of coaxing him on , as the company of a swift horse incites a slow one ; partly because she was determined to share his every trouble , if she could not remove it . A little choleric , and indeed downright prone to that more generous indignation which fires at the wrongs of others . When heated with emotion , or sentiment , she lowered her voice , instead of raising it like the rest of us . She called her mother “
1182	1186	1179	1180	Lady Placid	262	” and her brother “
1190	1503	1187	1190	Sir Imperturbable . ”	8309	” And so much for outlines . Mrs. Dodd laid aside her personal ambition with her maiden name ; but she looked high for her children . Perhaps she was all the more ambitious for them , that they had no rival aspirant in Mrs. Dodd . She educated Julia herself from first to last : but with true feminine distrust of her power to mould a lordling of creation , she sent Edward to Eton , at nine . This was slackening her tortoise ; for at Eton is no female master , to coax dry knowledge into a slow head . However , he made good progress in two branches — aquatics and cricket . After Eton came the choice of a profession . His mother recognised but four ; and these her discreet ambition speedily sifted down to two . For military heroes are shot now and then , however pacific the century ; and naval ones drowned . She would never expose her Edward to this class of accidents . Glory by all means ; glory by the pail ; but safe glory , please ; or she would none of it . Remained the church and the bar : and , within these reasonable limits , she left her dear boy free as air ; and not even hurried — there was plenty of time to choose : he must pass through the university to either . This last essential had been settled about a twelvemonth , and the very day for his going to Oxford was at hand , when one morning Mr. Edward formally cleared his throat : it was an unusual act , and drew the ladies ' eyes upon him . He followed the solemnity up by delivering calmly and ponderously a connected discourse , which astonished them by its length and purport . “
1517	1531	1504	1504	Mamma	1053	” ( This was his favourite expression , as well as habit . ) “
1650	1730	1642	1642	you	1054	” Mrs. Dodd had sat aghast , casting Edward deprecating looks at the close of each ponderous sentence , but too polite to interrupt a soul , even a son talking nonsense . She now assured him she could afford very well to send him to Oxford , and begged leave to remind him that he was too good and too sensible to run up bills there , like the young men who did not really love their parents . “
1870	1871	1874	1874	Edward	254	” “
1886	1900	1883	1884	a gentleman	1065	” said Julia eagerly . Mrs. Dodd caught a flash of her daughter : “
1910	1925	1926	1926	I	0	” said she warmly . She added presently , in her usual placid tone , “
1942	1966	1934	1934	I	0	” With this she kissed Edward tenderly on the brow , and drew an embrace and a little grunt of resignation from him . “
1979	2000	1934	1934	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd , with a little gentle accent of half reproach , scarce perceptible to a male ear . “
2005	2033	1934	1934	I	0	” and Julia rose and tripped to the door . There she stood a moment , half turned , with arching neck , colouring with innocent pleasure . “
2048	2072	2040	2040	you	1074	” The pair found a little room hard by , paved with china , crockery , glass , baths , kettles , & c. “
2090	2091	2040	2040	you	1074	” “
2115	2137	2138	2138	I	0	” His eye brightened ; he whipped out a two - foot rule , and began to calculate the cubic contents . “
2149	2228	2147	2147	Ju	265	” The ladies had their way ; the cases were made and despatched ; and one morning the Bus came for Edward , and stopped at the gate of Albion Villa . At this sight mother and daughter both turned their heads quickly away by one independent impulse , and set a bad example . Apparently neither of them had calculated on this paltry little detail ; they were game for theoretical departures ; to impalpable universities : and “
2241	2381	2235	2239	a Bus of the mind	1077	” would not have dejected for a moment their lofty Spartan souls on glory bent ; safe glory . But here was a Bus of wood , and Edward going bodily away inside it . The victim kissed them , threw up his portmanteau and bag , and departed serene as Italian skies ; the victors watched the pitiless Bus quite out of sight ; then went up to his bedroom , all disordered by packing , and , on the very face of it , vacant ; and sat down on his little bed intertwining and weeping . Edward was received at Exeter College , as young gentlemen are received at college ; and nowhere else , I hope , for the credit of Christendom . They showed him a hole in the roof , and called it an “
2384	2684	2235	2239	a Bus of the mind	1077	” grim pleasantry ! being a puncture in the modern Athens . They inserted him ; told him what hour at the top of the morning he must be in chapel ; and left him to find out his other ills . His cases were welcomed like Christians , by the whole staircase . These undergraduates abused one another 's crockery as their own : the joint stock of breakables had just dwindled very low , and Mrs. Dodd 's bountiful contribution was a godsend . The new comer soon found that his views of a learned university had been narrow . Out of place in it ? why , he could not have taken his wares to a better market ; the modern Athens , like the ancient , cultivates muscle as well as mind . The captain of the university eleven saw a cricket - ball thrown all across the ground ; he instantly sent a professional bowler to find out who that was ; through the same ambassador the thrower was invited to play on club days ; and proving himself an infallible catch and long - stop , a mighty thrower , a swift runner , and a steady , though not very brilliant bat , he was , after one or two repulses , actually adopted into the university eleven . He communicated this ray of glory by letter to his mother and sister with genuine delight , coldly and clumsily expressed ; they replied with feigned and fluent rapture . Advancing steadily in that line of academic study towards which his genius lay , he won a hurdle race , and sent home a little silver hurdle ; and soon after brought a pewter pot , with a Latin inscription recording the victory at “
2686	2707	2708	2709	The Lord	1078	” of Edward Dodd : but not too arrogantly ; for in the centre of the pot was this device , “
2714	2833	2708	2709	The Lord	1078	” The Curate of Sandford , who pulled number six in the Exeter boat , left Sandford for Witney : on this he felt he could no longer do his college justice by water , and his parish by land , nor escape the charge of pluralism , preaching at Witney and rowing at Oxford . He fluctuated , sighed , kept his Witney , and laid down his oar . Then Edward was solemnly weighed in his jersey and flannel trousers , and proving only eleven stone eight , whereas he had been ungenerously suspected of twelve stone , was elected to the vacant oar by acclamation . He was a picture in a boat ; and , “
2844	2970	2708	2709	The Lord	1078	” was a hearty ejaculation constantly hurled at him from the bank by many men of other colleges , and even by the more genial among the cads , as the Exeter glided at ease down the river , or shot up it in a race . He was now as much talked of in the university as any man of his college , except one . Singularly enough that one was his townsman ; but no friend of his ; he was much Edward 's senior in standing , though not in age ; and this is a barrier the junior must not step over — without direct encouragement — at Oxford . Moreover , the college was a large one , and some of “
2973	3127	2708	2709	The Lord	1078	” very exclusive : young Hardie was Doge of a studious clique ; and careful to make it understood that he was a reading man who boated and cricketed , to avoid the fatigue of lounging ; not a boatman or cricketer who strayed into Aristotle in the intervals of Perspiration . His public running since he left Harrow was as follows : the prize poem in his fourth term ; the sculls in his sixth ; the Ireland scholarship in his eighth ( he pulled second for it the year before ) ; Stroke of the Exeter in his tenth ; and reckoned sure of a first class to consummate his twofold career . To this young Apollo , crowned with variegated laurel , Edward looked up from a distance . The brilliant creature never bestowed a word on him by land ; and by water only such observations as the following : “
3132	3133	2708	2709	The Lord	1078	” “
3139	3140	2708	2709	The Lord	1078	” “
3147	3303	3305	3309	a good - natured spoon	1079	” Except , by - the - bye , one race ; when he swore at him like a trooper for not being quicker at starting . The excitement of nearly being bumped by Brasenose in the first hundred yards was an excuse . However , Hardie apologised as they were dressing in the barge after the race ; but the apology was so stiff , it did not pave the way to an acquaintance . Young Hardie , rising twenty - one , thought nothing human worthy of reverence , but Intellect . Invited to dinner , on the same day , with the Emperor of Russia , and with Voltaire , and with meek St. John , he would certainly have told the coachman to put him down at Voltaire . His quick eye detected Edward 's character ; but was not attracted by it : says he to one of his adherents , “
3320	3400	3401	3401	You	1080	” Edward , on the other hand , praised this brilliant in all his letters , and recorded his triumphs and such of his witty sayings as leaked through his own set , to reinvigorate mankind . This roused Julia 's ire . It smouldered through three letters ; but burst out when there was no letter ; but Mrs. Dodd , meaning , Heaven knows , no harm , happened to say meekly , a propos of Edward , “
3414	3415	3401	3401	You	1080	” “
3422	3427	3401	3401	You	1080	” said Julia defiantly . “
3432	3448	3430	3430	mamma	1053	” she continued , in answer to Mrs. Dodd 's eyebrow , which had curved ; “
3461	3466	3456	3456	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd smiled : “
3499	3500	3501	3501	Mamma	275	” “
3509	3524	3501	3501	Mamma	275	” was the tragic reply ; then , kicking off the buskin pretty nimbly , “
3567	3608	3558	3558	I	0	” She clenched her white teeth and imagined the struggle . To be sure , she owned she had never seen this Mr. Hardie ; but after all it was only Jane Hardie 's brother , as Edward was hers ; “
3632	3633	3628	3628	I	0	” “
3648	3649	3645	3645	your	0	” “
3699	3700	3695	3695	I	0	” “
3708	3709	3695	3695	I	0	” “
3731	3742	3724	3724	she	1089	” But she added softly , and with sudden gravity : “
3765	3766	3754	3754	her	276	” “
3771	3772	3773	3773	She	1089	” “
3780	3781	3782	3783	Par exemple	1094	” “
3785	3786	3782	3783	Par exemple	1094	” “
3790	3791	3782	3783	Par exemple	1094	” “
3799	3800	3782	3783	Par exemple	1094	” “
3838	3857	3835	3835	you	1053	” Mrs. Dodd looked a little staggered , too , at so vast a scheme of capitulation . But “
3859	3936	3942	3942	she	1089	” was soon explained to mean balls , concerts , dinner - parties in general , tea - parties without exposition of Scripture , races , and operas , cards , charades , and whatever else amuses society without perceptibly sanctifying it . All these , by Julia 's account , Miss Hardie had renounced , and was now denouncing ( with the young the latter verb treads on the very heels of the former ) . “
3948	4212	3942	3942	she	1089	” This climax delivered , Julia stopped short , and awaited the result . Mrs. Dodd heard it all with quiet disapproval and cool incredulity . She had seen so many young ladies healed of many young enthusiasms by a wedding ring . But , while she was searching diligently in her mine of ladylike English — mine with plenty of water in it , begging her pardon — for expressions to convey inoffensively , and roundabout , her conviction that Miss Hardie was a little , furious simpleton , the post came and swept the subject away in a moment . Two letters ; one from Calcutta , one from Oxford . They came quietly in upon one salver , and were opened and read with pleasurable interest , but without surprise , or misgiving ; and without the slightest foretaste of their grave amid singular consequences . Rivers deep and broad start from such little springs . David 's letter was of unusual length for him . The main topics were , first , the date and manner of his return home . His ship , a very old one , had been condemned in port : and he was to sail a fine new teak - built vessel , the Agra , as far as the Cape ; where her captain , just recovered from a severe illness , would come on board , and convey her and him to England . In future , Dodd was to command one of the Company 's large steamers to Alexandria and back . “
4279	4475	4477	4478	Dear Mamma	275	” The second topic was pecuniary ; the transfer of their savings from India , where interest was higher than at home , but the capital not so secure . And the third was ardent and tender expressions of affection for the wife and children he adored . These effusions of the heart had no separate place , except in my somewhat arbitrary analysis of the honest sailor 's letter ; they were the under current . Mrs. Dodd read part of it out to Julia ; in fact all but the money matter : that concerned the heads of the family more immediately ; and Cash was a topic her daughter did not understand , nor care about . And when Mrs. Dodd had read it with glistening eyes , she kissed it tenderly , and read it all over again to herself , and then put it into her bosom as naively as a milkmaid in love . Edward 's letter was short enough , and Mrs. Dodd allowed Julia to read it to her , which she did with panting breath , and glowing cheeks , and a running fire of comments . “
4491	4492	4484	4484	Ju	265	” “
4495	4501	4484	4484	Ju	265	” murmured Mrs. Dodd plaintively . “
4559	4560	4623	4623	smalls	1103	” “
4567	4568	4623	4623	smalls	1103	” “
4578	4579	4623	4623	smalls	1103	” “
4586	4605	4623	4623	smalls	1103	” Mrs. Dodd contrived to sigh interrogatively . Julia , who understood her every accent , reminded her that “
4607	4613	4623	4623	smalls	1103	” was the new word for “
4617	4618	4623	4623	smalls	1103	” “
4665	4666	4623	4623	smalls	1103	” “
4673	4677	4623	4623	smalls	1103	” inquired mamma , “
4694	4695	4623	4623	smalls	1103	” “
4762	4763	4764	4764	Heaven	273	” “
4782	4783	4788	4788	Puss	280	” “
4816	4817	4796	4796	he	1104	” “
4821	4822	4796	4796	he	1104	” “
4829	4830	4796	4796	he	1104	” “
4871	4896	4901	4901	I	0	” At this unfortunate reflection it was Julia 's turn to suffer . She deposited the letter in her lap , and fired up . “
4915	4916	4917	4917	Julia	255	” “

7467	7471	7473	7473	Edward	254	“ Never mind , ”
7476	7500	7473	7473	Edward	254	“ you have seen a capital race , the closest ever known on this river ; and one side or other must lose . ”
7501	7515	7517	7518	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ And if they did not quite win , they very nearly did , ”
7527	7540	7517	7518	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ He is not hurt , and that is the main thing . ”

I have heard a stretcher or two told , but I saw none broken . ( Puff . ) Their boat is the worst I ever saw ; it dips every stroke . ( Puff . ) Their strength lies in the crew . It was a good race and a fair one . Cambridge got a lead and kept it .

8167	8168	8169	8169	Mamma	1053	” “
8178	8186	8173	8173	you	1053	” cried Edward , slapping his thigh . “
8287	8288	8292	8292	you	1053	” “
8300	8305	8292	8292	you	1053	” inquired Julia warmly . “
8323	8463	8321	8321	you	1053	” At this thunderbolt of etiquette both ladies kept their countenances this was their muscular feat that day — and the racing for the sculls came on : six competitors , two Cambridge , three Oxford , one London . The three heats furnished but one good race , a sharp contest between a Cambridge man and Hardie , ending in favour of the latter ; the Londoner walked away from his opponent ; Sir Imperturbable 's competitor was impetuous , and ran into him in the first hundred yards ; Sir I. consenting calmly . The umpire , appealed to on the spot , decided that it was a foul , Mr. Dodd being in his own water . He walked over the course , and explained the matter to his sister , who delivered her mind thus — “
8494	8718	8486	8486	I	0	” He smiled unmoved ; she gave her scarf the irony twist , and they all went to dinner . The business recommenced with a race between a London boat and the winner ' of yesterday 's heat , Cambridge . Here the truth of Edward 's remark appeared . The Cambridge boat was too light for the men , and kept burying her hose ; the London craft , under a heavy crew , floated like a cork . The Londoners soon found out their advantage , and , overrating it , steered into their opponents water prematurely , in spite of a warning voice from the bank . Cambridge saw , and cracked on for a foul ; and for about a minute it was anybody 's race . But the Londoners pulled gallantly , and just scraped clear ahead . This peril escaped , they kept their backs straight and a clear lead to the finish . Cambridge followed a few feet in their wake , pulling wonderfully fast to the end , but a trifle out of form , and much distressed . At this both universities looked blue , their humble aspiration being , first to beat off all the external world , and then tackle each other for the prize . Just before Edward left his friends for “
8722	8777	8486	8486	I	0	” the final heat , a note was brought to him . He ran his eye over it , and threw it open into his sister 's lap . The ladies read it . Its writer had won a prize poem , and so now is our time to get a hint for composition : “
8902	8915	8893	8893	Julia	255	“ The race is not always to the slowest and the dearest . ”
8923	8926	8893	8893	Julia	255	“ foul . ”
8997	9002	9004	9004	Julia	255	“ We are third , ”
9154	9161	9162	9162	he	254	“ the horse that could stay : ”
9285	9295	9275	9283	two Exeter men with wild looks hunting for him	1266	“ Oh , Dodd ! Hardie wants you directly . ”
9296	9304	9306	9306	Julia	255	“ Do n't you go , Edward , ”
9308	9337	9306	9306	Julia	255	“ why should you be at Mr. Hardie 's beck and call ? I never heard of such a thing . That youth will make me hate him . ”
9338	9355	9357	9357	Edward	254	“ Oh , I think I had better just go and see what it is about , ”
9359	9366	9357	9357	Edward	254	“ I shall be back directly . ”
9641	9691	9634	9636	one of them	1277	“ For Heaven 's sake come back to the boat ! There is a crowd of all the colleges come round us ; and they all say Oxford is being sold . We had a chance for the four - oared race , and you are throwing it away . ”
9692	9702	9748	9748	Another	1228	“ What do I care what they all say ? ”
9715	9720	9634	9636	one of them	1277	“ But we care . ”
9721	9729	9731	9731	he	254	“ Care then ! I pity you . ”
9752	9763	9748	9748	Another	1228	“ Come , give us a civil answer , please . ”
9764	9785	9787	9788	the sufferer	1279	“ People that intrude upon a man 's privacy , racked with pain , have no right to demand civility , ”
9797	9804	9787	9788	the sufferer	1279	“ Do you call this privacy ? ”
9805	9839	9851	9852	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ It was , a minute ago . Do you think I left the boat , and came here among the natives , for company ? and noise ? With my head splitting ? ”
9870	9879	9881	9884	one , sotto voce	1281	“ ' There , it is no use , ”
9886	9922	9881	9884	one , sotto voce	1281	“ the bloke really has awful headaches , like a girl , and then he always shuts up this way . You will only rile him , and get the rough side of his tongue . ”
9948	9953	9955	9955	he	1282	“ Stop a minute , ”
9957	10012	9955	9955	he	1282	“ Mr. Hardie , I have not the honour to be acquainted with you , and I am not here to annoy you , nor to be affronted by you . But the university has a stake in this race , and the university expostulates through us — through me , if you like . ”
10013	10020	10022	10022	Hardie	264	“ Who have I the honour ? ”
10030	10036	10022	10022	Hardie	264	“ Badham , of Wadham . ”
10037	10121	9955	9955	he	1282	“ Badham o ' Wadham ? Hear that , ye tuneful nine ! Well , Badham o ' Wadham , you are no acquaintance of mine ; so you may possibly not be a fool . Let us assume by way of hypothesis that you are a man of sense , a man of reason as well as of rhyme . Then follow my logic . Hardie of Exeter is a good man in a boat when he has not got a headache . “
10141	10150	10129	10131	Hardie of Exeter	267	“ Hardie of Exeter has a headache now . “
10175	10218	10157	10159	the said Hardie	267	“ And , ergo , on the same premises , I , not being an egotist , nor an ass , have taken Hardie of Exeter and his headache out of the boat , as I should have done any other cripple . “
10236	10291	10221	10221	I	0	“ Total , I have given the university the benefit of my brains ; and the university , not having brains enough to see what it gains by the exchange , turns again and rends me , like an animal frequently mentioned in Scripture ; but , nota bene , never once with approbation . ”
10309	10320	10293	10295	the afflicted Rhetorician	1292	“ Is this your answer to the university , sir ? ”
10346	10398	10332	10333	the invalid	1293	“ Oh , if Badham o ' Wadham thinks to crush me auctoritate sua et totius universitatis , Badham o ' Wadham may just tell the whole university to go and be d —— d , from the Chancellor down to the junior cook at Skimmery Hall , with my compliments . ”
10399	10405	10407	10409	Badham of Wadham	300	“ Ill - conditioned brute ! ”
10411	10426	10407	10409	Badham of Wadham	300	“ Serve you right if the university were to chuck you into the Thames . ”
10678	10693	10675	10675	she	255	“ I have a great mind ; if I could but catch his eye . ”
10731	10734	10736	10738	Hardie 's adherent	1300	“ London ! ”
10740	10750	10752	10752	Hardie	267	“ What , are you there , old fellow ? ”
10759	10789	10752	10752	Hardie	267	“ Now , that is like a friend , a real friend , to sit by me , and not make a row . Thank you ! thank you ! ”
10824	10827	10828	10828	he	267	“ There , ”
10831	10862	10828	10828	he	267	“ was I wrong ? There is a swing for you ; there is a stroke . I did not know what a treasure I had got sitting behind me . ”
10882	10916	10917	10918	The adherent	1304	“ Sing out and tell him it is not like the sculls . We must fight for the lead at starting , and hold it with his eyelids when he has got it . ”
10938	10947	10925	10925	Edward	254	“ We mean to try all we know . ”
10948	10954	10956	10957	the invalid	1293	“ What is the odds ? ”
10960	10977	10956	10957	the invalid	1293	“ Even on London ; two to one against Cambridge ; three to one against us . ”
10978	10988	10990	10991	the sufferer	1279	“ Take all my tin and lay it on , ”
10993	11037	10990	10991	the sufferer	1279	“ Fork it out , then . Hallo ! eighteen pounds ? Fancy having eighteen pounds at the end of term . I 'll get the odds up at the bridge directly . Here 's a lady offering you her smelling - bottle . ”
11315	11324	11326	11327	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ You have a sad headache , sir , ”
11329	11337	11326	11327	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ oblige me by trying my salts . ”
11346	11351	11353	11353	Julia	255	“ And , mamma , ”
11355	11364	11353	11353	Julia	255	“ ought he to sit in the sun ? ”
11365	11386	11422	11422	Julia	255	“ Certainly not . You had better sit there , sir , and profit by our shade and our parasols . ”
11387	11406	11422	11422	Julia	255	“ Yes , mamma , but you know the real place where he ought to be is Bed . ”
11407	11416	11418	11419	the patient	1315	“ Oh , pray do n't say that , ”
11429	11446	11422	11422	Julia	255	“ And that is where he would go this minute , if I was his mamma . ”
11447	11457	11459	11460	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Instead of his junior , and a stranger , ”
11474	11477	11478	11478	Julia	255	“ stranger . ”
11494	11499	11501	11501	Hardie	267	“ Oh , madam ! ”
11504	11587	11501	11501	Hardie	267	“ I do not dispute her authority , nor yours . You have a right to send me where you please , after your kindness in noticing my infernal head , and doing me the honour to speak to me , and lending me this . But if I go to bed , my head will be my master . Besides , I shall throw away what little chance I have of making your acquaintance ; and the race just coming off ! ”
11588	11597	11599	11600	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ We will not usurp authority , sir , ”
11603	11634	11599	11600	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ but we know what a severe headache is , and should be glad to see you sit still in the shade , and excite yourself as little as possible . ”
11635	11640	11642	11643	the youth	1316	“ Yes , madam , ”
11862	11873	11843	11843	He	302	“ No : what ? Nothing wrong , I hope ? ”
11874	11888	11890	11890	Kennet	302	“ Why , two of our men are ploughed ; that is all , ”
11901	11924	11890	11890	Kennet	302	“ Confound it , Kennet , how you frightened me ! I was afraid there was some screw loose with the crew . ”
11951	11956	11958	11958	he	267	“ They are off ! ”
12088	12093	12095	12096	Mr. Punch	304	“ spoiled the lot , ”
12186	12192	12323	12323	Kennet	302	“ Cambridge was off quickest . ”
12193	12198	12162	12165	a river - god	1331	“ But not much . ”
12199	12208	12162	12165	a river - god	1331	“ Anybody 's race at present , madam . ”
12209	12226	12323	12323	Kennet	302	“ If this lasts long we may win . None of them can stay like us . ”
12227	12238	12162	12165	a river - god	1331	“ Come , the favourite is not so very dangerous . ”
12239	12244	12162	12165	a river - god	1331	“ Cambridge looks best . ”
12245	12256	12323	12323	Kennet	302	“ I would n't change with either , so far . ”
12257	12275	12276	12276	Julia	255	“ Now , in forty seconds more , I shall be able to pick out the winner . ”
12329	12336	12323	12323	Kennet	302	“ How do you construe γαστριμαργος ? ”
12398	12421	12373	12375	the judicious Kennet	1336	“ How do you construe ' Hoc age '' ? you incongruous dog . Hold your tongue , and mind the race . ”
12422	12459	12536	12536	Oxford	3	“ There , I thought so . Where 's your three to one , now ? The Cockneys are out of this event , any way . Go on , Universities , and order their suppers ! ”
12460	12468	12470	12470	Julia	255	“ But which is first , sir ? ”
12473	12482	12470	12470	Julia	255	“ Oh , which is first of all ? ”
12483	12529	12373	12375	the judicious Kennet	1336	“ Neither . Never mind ; it looks well . London is pumped ; and if Cambridge ca n't lead him before this turn in the river , the race will be ours . Now , look out ! By Jove , we are ahead ! ”
12589	12620	12581	12581	He	269	“ Well pulled , Stroke ! Well pulled all ! Splendidly pulled , Dodd ! You are walking away from them altogether . Hurrah , Oxford for ever , hurrah ! ”
12648	12655	12657	12657	Julia	255	“ We have won at last , ”
12663	12672	12657	12657	Julia	255	“ and fairly ; only think of that ! ”
12686	12709	12673	12673	Hardie	269	“ Yes , and the fools may thank me ; or rather my man , Dodd . Dodd for ever ! Hurrah ! ”
12760	12763	12737	12737	she	253	“ Dodd ! ”
12766	12771	12737	12737	she	253	“ the incongruous dog , ”
12781	12797	12737	12737	she	253	“ Dodd ? Ah , that 's the man who is just ploughed for smalls . ”
12890	12898	12882	12882	they	1343	“ Might it not be a mistake ? ”
12965	12971	12956	12956	Hardie	269	“ What does it matter ? ”
12975	12983	12956	12956	Hardie	269	“ he is a boating - man . “
13038	13043	13044	13044	I	0	” Says Kennet briskly , “
13059	13060	13051	13051	I	0	” “
13068	13069	13051	13051	I	0	” “
13075	13080	13081	13082	the testamurs	1352	” said Kennet jealously ; “
13092	13118	13119	13119	You	0	” And within this he started on his congenial errand . Hardie took two or three of his long strides , and fairly collared him . “
13127	13128	13119	13119	You	0	” “
13146	13147	13156	13156	him	1087	” “
13207	13235	13246	13246	you	0	” To his surprise , Kennet 's face expressed no sympathy , nor even bare assent . At this Hardie lost patience , and burst out impetuously , “
13317	13347	13351	13351	you	0	” The threat was extravagant ; but Youth 's glowing cheek and eye , and imperious lip , and simple generosity , made it almost beautiful . Kennet whined , “
13364	13365	13351	13351	you	0	” “
13378	13379	13372	13372	me	0	” “
13399	13404	13395	13395	you	0	” The incongruous dog ( “
13416	13440	13395	13395	you	0	” ) put this query with the severity of an inquisitor bringing back a garrulous prisoner to the point . Hardie replied gaily , “
13454	13455	13447	13447	you	0	” “
13481	13482	13489	13489	he	1360	” “
13521	13544	13550	13550	Dodd	254	” And he went hastily to meet Edward Dodd : and by that means intercepted him on his way to the carriage . “
13552	13556	13550	13550	Dodd	254	” he cried ; “
13588	13589	13576	13576	me	0	” “
13595	13620	13576	13576	me	0	” replied Edward calmly , but taking the offered hand cordially ; though he rather wanted to get away to his mother and sister . “
13633	13637	13641	13641	You	0	” continued Hardie . “
13650	13651	13647	13647	you	0	” “
13705	13706	13702	13702	your	0	” “
13769	13770	13756	13756	you	0	” “
13775	13781	13742	13742	you	0	” cried the impetuous youth . “
13801	13838	13839	13839	You	0	” And he shook Edward 's hand again with glistening eyes and an emotion that was quite unintelligible to Edward ; but not to the quick , sensitive spirits , who sat but fifteen yards off . “
13847	13889	13890	13891	the beloved	1368	” said Edward , and ran to the carriage , and put out both hands to the fair occupants . They kissed him eagerly , with little tender sighs ; and it cost them no slight effort not to cry publicly over “
13893	13894	13890	13891	the beloved	1368	” “
13898	13899	13890	13891	the beloved	1368	” “
13903	14001	13890	13891	the beloved	1368	” Young Hardie stood petrified . What ? These ladies Dodd 's sisters . Why , one of them had called the other mamma . Good heavens ! all his talk in their hearing had been of Dodd ; and Kennet and he between them had let out the very thing he wanted to conceal , especially from Dodd 's relations . He gazed at them , and turned hot to the very forehead . Then , not knowing what to do or say , and being after all but a clever boy , not a cool , “
14004	14190	14191	14192	Edward Dodd	254	” man of the world , he slipped away , blushing . Kennet followed , goggling . Left to herself , Mrs. Dodd would have broken the bad news to Edward at once , and taken the line of consoling him under her own vexation : it would not have been the first time that she had played that card . But young Mr. Hardie had said it would be unkind to poison Edward 's day : and it is sweet woman 's nature to follow suit ; so she and Julia put bright faces on , and Edward passed a right jocund afternoon with them . He was not allowed to surprise one of the looks they interchanged to relieve their secret mortification . But , after dinner , as the time drew near for him to go back to Oxford , Mrs. Dodd became silent , and a little distraite ; and at last drew her chair away to a small table , and wrote a letter . In directing it she turned it purposely , so that Julia could catch the address : “
14202	14525	14191	14192	Edward Dodd	254	” Julia was naturally startled at first , and her eye roved almost comically to and fro the letter and its Destination , seated calm and unconscious of woman 's beneficent wiles . But her heart soon divined the mystery : it was to reach him the first thing in the morning , and spare him the pain of writing the news to them ; and , doubtless , so worded as not to leave him a day in doubt of their forgiveness and sympathy . Julia took the missive unobserved by the Destination , and glided out of the room to get it quietly posted . The servant - girl was waiting on the second - floor lodgers , and told her so , with a significant addition , viz . , that the post was in this street , and only a few doors off . Julia was a little surprised at her coolness , but took the hint with perfect good temper , and just put on her shawl and bonnet , and went with it herself . The post - office was not quite so near as represented ; but she was soon there , for she was eager till she had posted it . But she came back slowly and thoughtfully ; here in the street , lighted only by the moon , and an occasional gaslight , there was no need for self - restraint , and soon her mortification betrayed itself in her speaking countenance . And to think that her mother , on whom she doted , should have to write to her son , there present , and post the letter ! This made her eyes fill , and before she reached the door of the lodging , they were brimming over . As she put her foot on the step , a timid voice addressed her in a low tone of supplication . “
14541	14597	14536	14537	Miss Dodd?—one	310	” She looked up surprised ; and it was young Mr. Hardie . His tall figure was bending towards her submissively , and his face , as well as his utterance , betrayed considerable agitation . And what led to so unusual a rencontre between a young gentleman and lady who had never been introduced ? “
14602	14660	14661	14663	the fools ”	8557	” says a reader of many novels . Why , yes ; the tenderest in all our nature : Wounded Vanity . Naturally proud and sensitive , and inflated by success and flattery , Alfred Hardie had been torturing himself ever since he fled Edward 's female relations . He was mortified to the core . He confounded “
14663	14821	14661	14663	the fools ”	8557	” ( his favourite synonym for his acquaintance ) for going and calling Dodd 's mother an elder sister , and so not giving him a chance to divine her . And then that he , who prided himself on his discrimination , should take them for ladies of rank , or , at all events , of the highest fashion and , climax of humiliation , that so great a man as he should go and seem to court them by praising Dodd of Exeter , by enlarging upon Dodd of Exeter , by offering to grind Logic with Dodd of Exeter . Who would believe that this was a coincidence , a mere coincidence ? They could not be expected to believe it ; female vanity would not let them . He tingled , and was not far from hating the whole family ; so bitter a thing is that which I have ventured to dub “
14826	14920	14661	14663	the fools ”	8557	” He itched to soothe his irritation by explaining to Edward . Dodd was a frank , good - hearted fellow ; he would listen to facts , and convince the ladies in turn . Hardie learned where Dodd 's party lodged , and waited about the door to catch him alone : Dodd must be in college by twelve , and would leave Henley before ten . He waited till he was tired of waiting . But at last the door opened ; he stepped forward , and out tripped Miss Dodd . “
14924	15072	14661	14663	the fools ”	8557	” muttered Hardie , and drew back . However , he stood and admired her graceful figure and action , her ladylike speed without bustling . Had she come back at the same pace , he would never have ventured to stop her : on such a thread do things hang : but she returned very slowly , hanging her head . Her look at him and his headache recurred to him — a look brimful of goodness . She would do as well as Edward , better perhaps . He yielded to impulse , and addressed her , but with all the trepidation of a youth defying the giant Etiquette for the first time in his life . Julia was a little surprised and fluttered , but did not betray it ; she had been taught self - command by example , if not by precept . “
15078	15173	15075	15076	Mr. Hardie	312	” said she , within a modest composure a young coquette might have envied under the circumstances . Hardie had now only to explain himself ; but instead of that , he stood looking at her within silent concern . The fair face she raised to him was wet with tears ; so were her eyes , and even the glorious eyelashes were fringed with that tender spray ; and it glistened in the moonlight . This sad and pretty sight drove the vain but generous youth 's calamity clean out of his head . “
15194	15206	15188	15188	I	0	” Julia turned her head away a little fretfully , with a “
15211	15239	15188	15188	I	0	” But soon her natural candour and simplicity prevailed ; a simplicity not without dignity ; she turned round to him and looked him in the face . “
15351	15370	15347	15347	I	0	” And the pure young heart , having opened itself by words , must flow a little more . “
15378	15384	15347	15347	I	0	” said young Hardie tenderly ; “
15426	15427	15439	15439	you	312	” “
15432	15436	15439	15439	you	312	” sighed Julia . “
15619	15756	15757	15764	a stranger , ” and under the moon	8573	” Julia sighed again . But it sounded now half like a sigh of relief — the final sigh , with which the fair consent to be consoled . And indeed this improvement in the music did not escape Hardie . He felt he was on the right tack : he enumerated fluently , and by name , many good men , besides Dean Swift , who had been ploughed , yet had cultivated the field of letters in their turn ; and , in short , he was so earnest and plausible , that something like a smile hovered about his hearer 's lips , and she glanced askant at him with furtive gratitude from under her silky lashes . But it soon recurred to her that this was rather a long interview to accord to “
15760	15773	15757	15764	a stranger , ” and under the moon	8573	” and under the moon ; so she said a little stiffly , “
15792	15793	15778	15778	you	1376	” “
15847	15848	15837	15837	you	1376	” “
15857	15858	15837	15837	you	1376	” “
15918	15919	15922	15923	Mr. Hardie	312	” “
15925	15933	15922	15923	Mr. Hardie	312	” said the young lady , smiling , “
15949	15950	15952	15952	I	0	” “
15963	15964	15959	15959	you	1376	” “
16078	16079	16063	16063	you	1376	” “
16093	16094	16083	16083	you	1376	” “
16159	16168	16142	16142	she	275	” With this she was about to retire . “
16186	16191	16192	16192	Me	0	” said Hardie imploringly . “
16218	16257	16197	16197	You	1376	” Hardie hung his head ; there was a touch of satire in the lady 's voice , he thought . Her soft eyes rested demurely on him a moment ; she saw he was a little abashed . “
16336	16493	16333	16333	her	8303	” She had begun within a polite composure borrowed from mamma ; but , once launched , her ardent nature got the better : her colour rose and rose , and her voice sank and sank , and the last words came almost in a whisper ; and such a lovely whisper : a gurgle from the heart ; and , as she concluded , her delicate hand came sweeping out with a heaven - taught gesture of large and sovereign cordiality , that made even the honest words and the divine tones more eloquent . It was too much ; the young man , ardent as herself , and not , in reality , half so timorous , caught fire ; and seeing a white , eloquent hand rather near him , caught it , and pressed his warm lips on it in mute adoration and gratitude . At this she was scared and offended . “
16502	16553	16333	16333	her	8303	” cried she , turning scarlet , and tossing her fair head into the air , like a startled stag ; and she drew her hand away quickly and decidedly , though not roughly . He stammered a lowly apology — in the very middle of it she said quietly , “
16561	16855	16558	16559	Mr. Hardie	312	” and swept , with a gracious little curtsey , through the doorway , leaving him spell - bound . And so the virginal instinct of self - defence carried her off swiftly and cleverly . But none too soon ; for , on entering the house , that external composure her two mothers Mesdames Dodd and Nature had taught her , fell from her like a veil , and she fluttered up the stairs to her own room with hot cheeks , and panted there like some wild thing that has been grasped at and grazed . She felt young Hardie 's lips upon the palm of her hand plainly ; they seemed to linger there still ; it was like light but live velvet . This , and the ardent look he had poured into her eyes , set the young creature quivering . Nobody had looked at her so before , and no young gentleman had imprinted living velvet on her hand . She was alarmed , ashamed , and uneasy . What right had he to look at her like that ? What shadow of a right to go and kiss her hand ? He could not pretend to think she had put it out to be kissed ; ladies put forth the back of the hand for that , not the palm . The truth was he was an impudent fellow , and she hated him now , and herself too , for being so simple as to let him talk to her : mamma would not have been so imprudent when she was a girl . She would not go down , for she felt there must be something of this kind legibly branded on her face : “
16898	16993	16871	16873	a young gentleman	8552	” But then , poor Edward ! she must go down . So she put a wet towel to her tell - tale cheeks , and dried them by artistic dabs , avoiding friction , and came downstairs like a mouse , and turned the door - handle noiselessly , and glided into the sitting - room looking so transparent , conscious , and all on fire with beauty and animation , that even Edward was startled , and , in a whisper , bade his mother observe what a pretty girl she was : “
17003	17028	16871	16873	a young gentleman	8552	” Mrs. Dodd did look ; and , consequently , as soon as ever Edward was gone to Oxford , she said to Julia , “
17050	17138	17043	17043	You	1400	” Julia complied willingly ; for she wanted to be alone and think . She retired to her own room , and went the whole day over again ; and was happy and sorry , exalted and uneasy , by turns ; and ended by excusing Mr. Hardie 's escapade , and throwing the blame on herself . She ought to have been more distant ; gentlemen were not expected , nor indeed much wanted , to be modest . A little assurance did not misbecome them . “
17148	17157	17141	17141	I	0	” said she to herself . Grand total : “
17165	17197	17160	17160	he	1404	” Time gallops in reverie : the town clock struck twelve , and with its iron tongue remorse entered her youthful conscience . Was this obeying mamma ? Mamma had said , “
17202	17205	17160	17160	he	1404	” not , “
17215	17266	17160	17160	he	1404	” She gave an expressive shake of her fair shoulders , like a swan flapping the water off its downy wings , and so dismissed the subject from her mind . Then she said her prayers . Then she rose from her knees , and in tones of honey said , “
17274	17299	17160	17160	he	1404	” and awaited a result . Thieves and ghosts she did not believe in , yet credited cats under beds , and thought them neither “
17301	17303	17160	17160	he	1404	” nor “
17305	17349	17160	17160	he	1404	” there . After tenderly evoking the dreaded and chimerical quadruped , she proceeded none the less to careful research , especially of cupboards . The door of one resisted , and then yielded with a crack , and blew out the candle . “
17353	17380	17160	17160	he	1404	” said she . It was her only light , except her beauty . They allotted each Hebe but one candle , in that ancient burgh . “
17383	17387	17160	17160	he	1404	” she thought , “
17396	17455	17160	17160	he	1404	” She went to draw back one of the curtains ; but in the act she started back with a little scream . There was a tall figure over the way watching the house . The moon shone from her side of the street full on him , and in that instant her quick eye recognised Mr. Hardie . “
17458	17523	17160	17160	he	1404	” said she aloud , and with an indescribable inflexion ; and hid herself swiftly in impenetrable gloom . But , after a while , Eve 's daughter must have a peep . She stole with infinite caution to one side of the curtain , and made an aperture just big enough for one bright eye . Yes , there he was , motionless . “
17529	17592	17524	17524	I	0	” said she to him , malignantly , as if the sound could reach him . Unconscious of the direful threat , he did not budge . She was unaffectedly puzzled at this phenomenon ; and , not being the least vain , fell to wondering whether he played the nightly sentinel opposite every lady 's window who exchanged civilities within him . “
17604	17674	17601	17602	a fool	1058	” said she , promptly . But on reflection , she felt sure he did nothing of the kind habitually , for he had too high an opinion of himself ; she had noted that trait in him at a very early stage . She satisfied herself , by cautious examination , that he did not know her room . He was making a temple of the whole lodging . “
17680	17790	17678	17678	him	1408	” Yet he appeared to be happy over it ; there was an exalted look in his moonlit face ; she seemed now first to see his soul there . She studied his countenance like an inscription , and deciphered each rapt expression that crossed it ; and stored them in her memory . Twice she left her ambuscade to go to bed , and twice Curiosity , or Something , drew her back . At last , having looked , peered , and peeped , till her feet were cold , and her face the reverse , she informed herself that the foolish Thing had tired her out . “
17798	17808	17795	17796	Mr. Policeman	320	” said she , pretending to bawl to him . “
17822	17962	17819	17819	you	320	” With this benevolent aspiration , a little too violent to be sincere , she laid her cheek on her pillow doughtily . But her sentinel , when out of sight , had more power to disturb her . She lay and wondered whether he was still there , and what it all meant , and whatever mamma would say ; and which of the two , she or he , was the head culprit in this strange performance , to which Earth , she conceived , had seen no parallel ; and , above all , what he would do next . Her pulse galloped , and her sleep was broken ; and she came down in the morning a little pale . Mrs. Dodd saw it at once , with the quick maternal eye ; and moralised : “
18018	18171	18005	18005	I	0	” Ah ! Will that home be as tranquil now ? THE long vacation commenced about a month afterwards , and Hardie came to his father 's house , to read for honours , unimpeded by university races and college lectures ; and the ploughed and penitent one packed up his Aldrich and his Whately , the then authorities in Logic , and brought them home , together with a firm resolution to master that joyous science before the next examination for Smalls in October . But lo ! ere he had been an hour at home , he found his things put neatly away in his drawers on the feminine or vertical system — deep strata of waistcoats , strata of trousers , strata of coats , strata of papers — and his Logic gone . In the course of the evening he taxed his sister good - humouredly , and asked “
18185	18186	18005	18005	I	0	” “
18202	18216	18187	18187	I	0	” replied Julia , rather languidly — considering the weight of the resolve . “
18238	18239	18227	18227	I	0	” “
18266	18267	18268	18268	I	0	” “
18307	18308	18300	18301	a girl	8466	” “
18333	18353	18326	18327	other people	1420	” Before Edward could fully digest this revelation , she gave the argument a new turn by adding fretfully , “
18366	18376	18377	18377	Halloa	323	” and all in a moment she was crying . “
18379	18388	18377	18377	Halloa	323	” ejaculated Edward , taken quite by surprise . “
18396	18408	18394	18394	dears	1421	” inquired maternal vigilance from the other end of the room . “
18419	18420	18409	18409	You	1053	” “
18425	18430	18409	18409	You	1053	” said Julia eagerly . “
18459	18509	18450	18450	Mamma	275	” And she laid her brow on her mother 's bosom . Mrs. Dodd caressed the lovely head soothingly with one hand , and made a sign over it to Edward to leave them alone . She waited quietly till Julia was composed : and then said , softly , “
18582	18583	18585	18585	you	0	” “
18589	18598	18585	18585	you	0	” said Julia , scarcely above a whisper . “
18669	18670	18671	18671	I	0	” “
18678	18686	18671	18671	I	0	” said Julia , hiding her head . “
18714	18741	18742	18742	Mamma	275	” Mrs. Dodd inquired how long this had been . Julia did not answer this question ; she went on , with her face still hidden : “
18893	18944	18945	18945	I	0	” A deep sigh followed the confession of these multiform imperfections ; and the culprit half raised her head to watch their effect . As for Mrs. Dodd , she opened her eyes wide with surprise ; but at the end of the heterogeneous catalogue she smiled , and said , “
18985	19004	19009	19011	the old Julia	1435	” Her daughter kissed her gratefully , and smiled : but after a pause , said , sorrowfully , “
19040	19046	19031	19031	I	0	” ( within sudden fervour ) “
19062	19063	19048	19060	a dreamy , wandering , vain , egotistical , hysterical , abominable girl	1438	” “
19077	19082	19070	19070	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd . “
19089	19124	19086	19086	me	0	” She rested her eyes calm and penetrating upon her daughter ; and at this mere look , but a very searching one , the colour mounted and mounted in Julia 's cheek strangely . “
19128	19134	19135	19135	yours	1440	” said Mrs. Dodd thoughtfully , “
19171	19179	19181	19181	Julia	255	“ To a weed , I fear , ”
19183	19220	19181	19181	Julia	255	“ What will you say when I own I felt no real joy at Edward 's return this time ? And yesterday I cried , ' Do get away , and do n't pester me ! ' ”
19221	19228	19157	19157	she	1441	“ To your brother ? Oh ! ”
19229	19256	19181	19181	Julia	255	“ Oh , no , mamma , that was to poor Spot . He jumped on me in a reverie , all affection , poor thing . ”
19257	19274	19181	19181	Julia	255	“ Well , for your comfort , dogs do not appreciate the niceties of our language . ”
19275	19287	19157	19157	she	1441	“ I am afraid they do ; when we kick them . ”
19310	19389	19307	19307	Julia	255	“ Oh no ! no ! do n't laugh at me , but help me within your advice : you are so wise and so experienced : you must have been a girl before you were an angel . You must know what is the matter with me . Oh , do pray cure me , or else kill me , for I can not go on like this , all my affections deadened and my peace disturbed . ”
19407	19410	19412	19413	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Julia , ”
19418	19547	19412	19413	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ if it was not my child , reared under my eye , and never separated from me a single day , I should say , this young lady is either afflicted with some complaint , and it affects her nerves and spirits ; or else she has — she is — what inexperienced young people call ' in love . ' You need not look so frightened , child ; nobody in their senses suspects you of imprudence or indelicacy ; and therefore I feel quite sure that your constitution is at a crisis , or your health has suffered some shock — pray Heaven it may not be a serious one . You will have the best advice , and without delay , I promise you . ”
19679	19681	19663	19663	she	253	“ Hyperaesthesia ”
19692	19705	19663	19663	she	253	“ or as unprofessional persons would say , ' excessive sensibility . ' ”
19780	19788	19790	19790	he	326	“ We must treat her for that , ”
19796	19830	19790	19790	he	326	“ but for the rest , active employment , long walks or rides , and a change of scene and associations , will be all that will be required . In these cases , ”
19835	19853	19854	19854	He	326	“ connected as they are with Hyperaemia , some medical men considered moderate venesection to be indicated . ”
19862	19981	19854	19854	He	326	“ The diet , of course , must be Antiphlogistic . Let us say then , for breakfast , dry toast with very little butter — no coffee — cocoa ( from the nibs ) , or weak tea : for luncheon , beef - tea or mutton - broth : for dinner , a slice of roast chicken , and tapioca or semolina pudding . I would give her one glass of sherry , but no more , and barley - water ; it would be as well to avoid brown meats , at all events for the present . With these precautions , my dear madam , I think your anxiety will soon be happily removed . ”
20042	20067	20035	20035	she	1031	“ Why not go to the top of the tree at once , and call in Dr. Short ? You have heard of him ? ”
20068	20113	20118	20118	he	1460	“ Oh , yes ; I have even met him in society ; a most refined person : I will certainly follow your advice and consult him . Oh , thank you , Mrs. Bosanquet ! A propos , do you consider him skilful ? “
20128	20247	20118	20118	he	1460	” This was so convincing , that off went another three - cocked note , and next day a dark - green carriage and pair dashed up to Mrs. Dodd 's door , and Dr. Short bent himself in an arc , got out , and slowly mounted the stairs . He was six feet two , wonderfully thin , livid , and gentleman - like . Fine homing head , keen eye , lantern jaws . At sight of him Mrs. Dodd rose and smiled . Julia started and sat trembling . He stepped across the room inaudibly , and after the usual civilities , glanced at the patient 's tongue , and touched her wrist delicately . “
20252	20330	20331	20331	You	1463	” said he . Mrs. Dodd detailed the symptoms . Dr. Short listened within the patient politeness of a gentleman , to whom all this was superfluous . He asked for a sheet of note - paper , and divided it so gently , he seemed to be persuading one thing to be two . He wrote a pair of prescriptions , and whilst thus employed looked up every now and then and conversed with the ladies . “
20353	20354	20338	20339	Miss Dodd	255	” “
20359	20395	20357	20357	sir	1075	” said Julia quietly . Dr. Short looked a little surprised ; his female patients rarely contradicted him . Was it for them to disown things he was so a good as to assign them ? “
20398	20402	20357	20357	sir	1075	” said he , “
20426	20492	20495	20495	madam	8503	” He then numbered the prescriptions , 1 , 2 , and advised Mrs. Dodd to drop No . 1 after the eighth day , and substitute No . 2 , to be continued until convalescence . He put on his gloves to leave . Mrs. Dodd then , with some hesitation , asked him humbly whether she might ask him what the disorder was . “
20497	20502	20495	20495	madam	8503	” said he graciously ; “
20559	20560	20646	20646	Osmond	326	” “
20570	20571	20646	20646	Osmond	326	” “
20583	20584	20585	20585	You	1463	” “
20589	20594	20585	20585	You	1463	” said Mrs. Dodd . “
20603	20643	20595	20596	Dr. Osmond	326	” And she consulted her little ivory tablets , whereon she had written the word . But meantime , Dr. Short 's mind , to judge by his countenance , was away roaming distant space in search of Osmond . “
20657	20658	20648	20648	I	0	” “
20665	20669	20648	20648	I	0	” cried Julia , “
20679	20702	20710	20711	a surgeon	1469	” Mrs. Dodd held up her finger to this outspoken patient . But a light seemed to break in on Dr. Short . “
20758	20781	20786	20786	him	326	” Dr. Short paused , apparently to realise this phenomenon in the world of Mind . He resumed in a different tone : “
20931	20942	20927	20927	I	0	” and the Doctor eked out this sentence by rising . “
20951	20960	20961	20961	you	0	” said Mrs. Dodd , rising within him ; “
20969	21231	20961	20961	you	0	” As if under the influence of these feelings only , she took Dr. Short 's palm and pressed it . Of the two hands , which met for a moment then , one was soft and melting , the other a bunch of bones ; but both were very white , and so equally adroit , that a double fee passed without the possibility of a bystander suspecting it . For the benefit of all young virgins afflicted like Julia Dodd , here are the Doctor 's prescriptions : — Rx Pil : Hydrarg : Chlor : Co : singuml : nocte sumend : Decoc : Aloes Co : 3j omni mane viii . Sept. J. S. — — — - FOR MISS DODD . Rx Conf : Sennae . Potass : Bitartrat . Extr : Tarax : a a 3ss Misft : Elect : Cujus sum : 3j omni mane . xviii . Sept. J. S. — — — - I d : Anglie reddit : per me Carol : Arundin : The same done into English by me . C. R. 1 . O Jupiter aid us ! ! Plummer 's pill to be taken every night , 1 oz . compound decoction of Aloes every morning . 8th Sept. J. S. 2 . O Jupiter aid us ! ! with Confection of Senna , Bitartrate of Potash , extract of Dandelion , of each half an ounce , let an electuary be mixed ; of which let her take 1 drachm every morning . 18th Sept. J. S. “
21236	21255	21233	21234	the courtier	1479	” said Mrs. Dodd , delighted . Julia assented : she even added , with a listless yawn , “
21275	21284	21299	21299	he	1482	” Mrs. Dodd admitted he was very thin . “
21338	21364	21311	21311	Death	336	” Mrs. Dodd forbade her to give way to such gloomy ideas ; and expostulated firmly with her for judging learned men by their bodies . “
21367	21371	21311	21311	Death	336	” said she , “
21406	21525	21396	21396	I	0	” Poor Mrs. Dodd was herself slipping into a morbid state . A mother collecting Doctors ! It is a most fascinating kind of connoisseurship , grows on one like Drink ; like Polemics ; like Melodrama ; like the Millennium ; like any Thing . Sure enough , the very next week she and Julia sat patiently at the morning levee of an eminent and titled London surgeon . Full forty patients were before them : so they had to wait and wait . At last they were ushered into the presence - chamber , and Mrs. Dodd entered on the beaten ground of her daughter 's symptoms . The noble surgeon stopped her civilly but promptly . “
21533	21573	21396	21396	I	0	” said he , and drew his stethoscope . Julia shrank and cast an appealing look at her mother ; but the impassive chevalier reported on each organ in turn without moving his ear from the key - hole : “
21578	21586	21396	21396	I	0	” said he , a little plaintively : “
21640	21664	21627	21627	I	0	” He deposited the instrument , and said , not without a certain shade of satisfaction that his research had not been fruitless , “
21672	21673	21627	21627	I	0	” “
21682	21688	21627	21627	I	0	” said poor Mrs. Dodd . “
21695	21712	21739	21739	Guinea	339	” ( he scratched a prescription which would not have misbecome the tomb of Cheops ) , “
21720	21729	21739	21739	Guinea	339	” Ting ! He struck a bell . That “
21731	21734	21739	21739	Guinea	339	” said , “

21753	21774	21778	21779	own mamma	1489	” said Mrs. Dodd , sinking back in her hired carriage , and the tears were in her patient eyes . “
21781	21786	21778	21779	own mamma	1489	” said Julia earnestly , “
21861	21862	21849	21850	a doctress	1497	” “

22111	22125	22060	22060	he	340	” To an inquiry whether there was heart - disease , he replied , “
22128	22143	22060	22060	he	340	” On being told Sir William had announced heart - disease , he said , “
22152	22180	22060	22060	he	340	” He maintained , however , that it must be trifling , and would go no further , the nervous system once restored to its healthy tone . “
22193	22206	22060	22060	he	340	” Dr. Kenyon found the mucous membrane was irritated and required soothing . “
22212	22285	22286	22290	Dr. Short — Mr. Osmond	326	” Mrs. Dodd returned home consoled and confused ; Julia listless and apathetic . Tea was ordered , with two or three kinds of bread , thinnest slices of meat , and a little blane mange , & c. , their favourite repast after a journey ; and whilst the tea was drawing , Mrs. Dodd looked over the card - tray and enumerated the visitors that had called during their absence . “
22329	22330	22336	22336	mamma	1053	” “
22338	22339	22336	22336	mamma	1053	” “
22346	22347	22340	22344	A very manly young gentleman	1518	” “
22360	22361	22363	22363	he	1518	” “
22388	22389	22393	22393	you	1053	” “
22403	22408	22393	22393	you	1053	” Julia added faintly , “
22415	22416	22410	22410	he	1518	” “
22443	22503	22435	22435	he	1518	” Julia looked down smiling ; but presently seemed to be seized with a spirit of contradiction : she began to pick poor Alfred to pieces ; he was this , that , and the other ; and then so bold , she might say impudent . Mrs. Dodd replied calmly that he was very kind to her boy . “
22518	22519	22515	22515	he	1518	” “
22551	22587	22539	22539	He	1518	” The tea was now ready , and Mrs. Dodd sat down , and patted a chair , with a smile of invitation for Julia to come and sit beside her . But Julia said , “
22594	22621	22539	22539	He	1518	” and left the room . When she came back , she fluttered up to her mother and kissed her vehemently , then sat down radiant . “
22624	22629	22539	22539	He	1518	” said Mrs. Dodd , “
22647	22648	22641	22641	you	1053	” “
22680	22876	22672	22672	Me	0	” She spake , and to confirm her words the airy thing went waltzing , sailing , and fluttering round the room , and sipping mamma every now and then on the wing . In this buoyancy she remained some twenty - four hours ; and then came clouds and chills , which , in their turn , gave way to exultation , duly followed by depression . Her spirits were so uncertain , that things too minute to justify narration turned the scale either way : a word from Mrs. Dodd — a new face at St. Anne 's Church looking devoutly her way — a piece of town gossip distilled in her ear by Mrs. Maxley — and she was sprightly or languid , and both more than reason . One drizzly afternoon they were sitting silent and saddish in the drawing - room , Mrs. Dodd correcting the mechanical errors in a drawing of Julia 's , and admiring the rare dash and figure , and Julia doggedly studying Dr. Whately 's Logic , with now and then a sigh , when suddenly a trumpet seemed to articulate in the little hall : “
22882	22898	22899	22899	I	0	” The lady rose from her seat , and said with a smile of pleasure , “
22904	22938	22672	22672	Me	0	” The door opened , and in darted a grey - headed man , with handsome but strongly marked features , laughing and shouting like a schoolboy broke loose . He cried out , “
22950	22982	22941	22941	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd glided to meet him , and put out both her hands , the palms downwards , with the prettiest air of ladylike cordiality ; he shook them heartily . “
23033	23034	23053	23053	Sawmill	349	” “
23041	23042	23046	23047	your husband	1533	” “
23055	23056	23053	23053	Sawmill	349	” “
23064	23065	23061	23061	you	1529	” “
23098	23113	23115	23115	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd replied that he was on the seas , but expect — — “
23147	23148	23133	23135	the little girl	1536	” “
23161	23162	23133	23135	the little girl	1536	” “
23185	23186	23182	23182	I	0	” “
23189	23195	23182	23182	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd sadly , “
23210	23211	23200	23200	she	1536	” “
23225	23250	23221	23221	she	1536	” And he burst into a ringing laugh : but in the middle of it , stopped dead short , and his face elongated . “
23256	23261	23221	23221	she	1536	” said he impressively , “
23346	23361	23328	23328	they	1544	” Mrs. Dodd looked a little confused , and exchanged speaking glances with Julia . “
23364	23369	23328	23328	they	1544	” she said calmly , “
23406	23419	23403	23404	Dr. Kenyon	343	” And she felt invulnerable behind her phalanx of learning and reputation . “
23423	23428	23455	23456	Miss Floree	352	” roared the visitor , “
23466	23467	23455	23456	Miss Floree	352	” “
23475	23492	23473	23473	Julia	255	” observed Mrs. Dodd , a little haughtily ; but instantly recovering herself , she said , “
23508	23509	23495	23496	Dr. Sampson	357	” “
23538	23688	23690	23690	you	1553	” put in the visitor , with such prodigious swiftness of elocution that the words went tumbling over one another like railway carriages out on pleasure , and the sentence was a pile of loud , indistinct syllables . Julia 's lovely eyes dilated at this clishmaclaver , and she bowed coldly . Dr. Sampson had revealed in this short interview nearly all the characteristics of voice , speech , and manner , she had been taught from infancy to shun : boisterous , gesticulatory , idiomatic ; and had taken the discourse out of her mamma 's mouth twice . Now Albion Villa was a Red Indian hut in one respect : here nobody interrupted . Mrs. Dodd had little personal egotism , but she had a mother 's , and could not spare this opportunity of adding another Doctor to her collection : so she said hurriedly , “
23704	23764	23690	23690	you	1553	” Julia sighed aloud , and deprecated the subject with earnest furtive signs ; Mrs. Dodd would not see them . Now , Dr. Sampson was himself afflicted with what I shall venture to call a mental ailment ; to wit , a furious intolerance of other men 's opinions ; he had not even patience to hear them . “
23771	23776	23765	23765	Mai	359	” said he hastily , “
23829	23830	23831	23831	Julia	255	” “
23833	23838	23831	23831	Julia	255	” ejaculated Mrs. Dodd , “
23844	23845	23831	23831	Julia	255	” “
23853	23859	23831	23831	Julia	255	” cried Dr. Sampson defiantly ; “
23881	23882	23864	23864	D'ye	1560	” “
23907	23908	23892	23892	they	1561	” “
23948	23961	23915	23915	you	1473	” Here he paused for a moment , then answered himself furiously , “
23965	23975	23915	23915	you	1473	” This blast blown , he moderated a little . “
23979	23983	24006	24006	midicine	361	” said he , “
24269	24306	24309	24309	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd thanked him coldly for the offer , but said she would be more grateful if he would show his superiority to persons of known ability by just curing her daughter on the spot . “
24312	24326	24309	24309	I	0	” said he carelessly : and all his fire died out of him . “
24334	24404	24309	24309	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd knew her man ( ladies are very apt to fathom their male acquaintance — too apt , I think ) ; and , to pin him to the only medical theme which interested her , seized the opportunity while he was in actual contact with Julia 's wrist , and rapidly enumerated her symptoms , and also told him what Mr. Osmond had said about Hyperaesthesia . “
24408	24491	24405	24406	GOOSE GREECE	365	” barked Sampson , loud , clear , and sharp as an irritated watch - dog ; but this one bow - wow vented , he was silent as abruptly . Mrs. Dodd smiled , and proceeded to Hyperaemia , and thence to the Antiphlogistic Regimen . At that unhappy adjective , Sampson jumped up , cast away his patient 's hand , forgot her existence — she was but a charming individual — and galloped into his native region , Generalities . “
24880	24881	24883	24883	me	0	” “
24885	24890	24883	24883	me	0	” said Mrs. Dodd ; “
24905	24911	24913	24913	Sampson	357	“ N ' list me ! ”
24915	25183	24913	24913	Sampson	357	“ ye're goen to fathom th ' antiphlogistics , since they still survive an ' slay in holes and corners like Barkton and d'Itly ; I 've driven the vamperes out o ' the cintres o ' civilisation . Begin with their coolers ! Exhaustion is not a cooler , it is a feverer , and they know it ; the way parrots know sentences . Why are we all more or less feverish at night ? Because we are weaker . Starvation is no cooler , it is an inflamer , and they know it — as parrots know truths , but ca n't apply them : for they know that burning fever rages in ivery town , street , camp , where Famine is . As for blood - letting , their prime cooler , it is inflammatory ; and they know it ( parrot - wise ) , for the thumping heart and bounding pulse of pashints blid by butchers in black , and bullocks blid by butchers in blue , prove it ; and they have recorded this in all their books : yet stabbed , and bit , and starved , and mercuried , and murdered on . But mind ye , all their sham coolers are real weakeners ( I wonder they did n't inventory Satin and his brimstin lake among their refrijrators ) , and this is the point whence t ' appreciate their imbecility , and the sairvice I have rendered mankind in been the first t ' attack their banded school , at a time it seemed imprignable . ”
25184	25194	25196	25197	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Ah ! this promises to be very interesting , ”
25199	25235	25196	25197	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ and before you enter on so large a field , perhaps it would be as well to dispose of a little matter which lies at my heart . Here is my poor daughter — — ”
25236	25571	24913	24913	Sampson	357	“ NLISSMEE ! A human Bean is in a constant state of flux and reflux ; his component particles move , change , disappear , and are renewed ; his life is a round of exhaustion and repair . Of this repair the brain is the sovereign ajint by night and day , and the blood the great living material , and digestible food th ' indispensible supply . And this balance of exhaustion and repair is too nice to tamper with : disn't a single sleepless night , or dinnerless day , write some pallor on the face , and tell against the buddy ? So does a single excessive perspiration , a trifling diary , or a cut finger , though it takes but half an ounce of blood out of the system . And what is the cause of that rare ivint — which occurs only to pashmints that ca n't afford docking — Dith from old age ? Think ye the man really succumms under years , or is mowed down by Time ? Nay , yon 's just Potry an ' Bosh . Nashins have been thinned by the lancet , but niver by the scythe ; and years are not forces , but misures of events . No , Centenarius decays and dies bekase his bodil ' expindituire goes on , and his bodil ' income falls off by failure of the reparative and reproductive forces . And now suppose bodil ' exhaustion and repair were a mere matter of pecuniary , instead of vital , economy : what would you say to the steward or housekeeper , who , to balance your accounts and keep you solvent , should open every known channel of expinse with one hand , and with the other — stop the supplies ? Yet this is how the Dockers for thirty cinturies have burned th ' human candle at both ends , yet wondered the light of life expired under their hands . ”
25572	25587	24913	24913	Sampson	357	“ It seems irrational . Then in my daughter 's case you would — — ”
25588	25919	25924	25924	his	1592	“ Looksee ! A pashint falls sick . What haps directly ? Why the balance is troubled , and exhaustion exceeds repair . For proof obsairve the buddy when Disease is fresh ! to put it economikly , and then you must understand it , bein a housekeeper — But to this sick and therefore weak man , comes a Docker purblind with cinturies of Ca nt , Pricidint , Blood , and Goose Greece ; imagines him a fiery pervalid , though the common sense of mankind through its interpreter common language , pronounces him an ' invalid , ' gashes him with a lancet , spills out the great liquid material of all repair by the gallon , and fells this weak man , wounded now , and pale , and fainting , with Dith stamped on his face , to th ' earth , like a bayoneted soldier or a slaughtered ox . If the weak man , wounded thus , and weakened , survives , then the chartered Thugs who have drained him by the bung - hole , turn to and drain him by the spigot ; they blister him , and then calomel him : and lest Nature should have the ghost of a chance to conterbalance these frightful outgoings , they keep strong meat and drink out of his system emptied by their stabs , bites , purges , mercury , and blisters ; damdijjits ! And that , Asia excipted , was profissional Midicine from Hippocrates to Sampsin . Antiphlogistic is but a modern name for an ass - ass - inating rouutine which has niver varied a hair since scholastic midicine , the silliest and didliest of all the hundred forms of Quackery , first rose — unlike Seeince , Art , Religion , and all true Suns — in the West ; to wound the sick ; to weaken the weak ; and mutilate the hurt ; and thin mankind . ”
25987	26015	26016	26016	She	253	“ This is irresistible ; you have confuted everybody , to their heart 's content ; and now the question is , what course shall we substitute ? ”
26019	26029	26016	26016	She	253	“ in the great case , which occupies me . ”
26043	26231	26031	26031	Sampson	357	“ What course ? Why the great Chronothairmal practice , based on the remittent and febrile character of all disease ; above all , on By Remittency , I mean th ' ebb of Disease , by Perriodicity , th ' ebb and also the flow , the paroxysm and the remission . These remit and recur , and keep tune like the tides , not in ague and remittent fever only , as the Profission imagines to this day , but in all diseases from a Scirrhus in the Pylorus t ' a toothache . And I discovered this , and the new path to cure of all diseases it opens . Alone I did it ; and what my reward ? Hooted , insulted , belied , and called a quack by the banded school of profissional assassins , who , in their day hooted Harvey and Jinner — authors too of great discoveries , but discoveries narrow in their consequences compared with mine . T ' appreciate Chronothairmalism , ye must begin at the beginning ; so just answer me — What is man ? ”
26278	26283	26267	26267	Sampson	357	“ WHAT IS MAN ? ”
26305	26315	26317	26318	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ How can that child answer such a question ? ”
26320	26328	26317	26318	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Let us return to the point . ”
26329	26347	26284	26284	Julia	255	“ I have never strayed an inch from it . It 's about ' Young Physic . ' ”
26348	26372	26317	26318	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ No , excuse me , it is about a young lady . Universal Medicine : what have I to do with that ? ”
26373	26383	26385	26385	Sampson	357	“ Now this is the way with them all , ”
26389	26663	26385	26385	Sampson	357	“ there lowed John Bull . The men and women of this benighted nashin have an ear for anything , provided it matters nothing : talk Jology , Conchology , Entomology , Theology , Meteorology , Astronomy , Deuteronomy , Botheronomy , or Boshology , and one is listened to with rivirence , because these are all far - off things in fogs ; but at a word about the great , near , useful art of Healing , y' all stop your ears ; for why ? your life and dailianhourly happiness depend on it . But ' no , ' sis John Bull , the knowledge of our own buddies , and how to save our own Bakin — Beef I mean — day by day , from disease and chartered ass - ass - ins , all that may interest the thinkers in Saturn , but what the deevil is it t ' us ? Talk t ' us of the hiv'nly buddies , not of our own ; babble o ' comets an ' meteors an ' Ethereal nibulae ( never mind the nibulae in our own skulls ) . Discourse t ' us of Predistinashin , Spitzbairgen seaweed , the last novel , the siventh vile ; of Chrisehinising the Patagonians on condition they are not to come here and Chrischinise the Whitechapelians ; of the letter to the Times from the tinker wrecked at Timbuctoo ; and the dear Professor 's lecture on the probabeelity of snail - shells in the backyard of the moon : but do n't ask us to know ourselves — Ijjits ! ! ”

My ambition is to cure my girl , and leave mankind in peace . Now , if you will begin with my Julia , I will submit to rectify the universe in its proper turn . Any time will do to set the human race right ; you own it is in no hurry : but my child 's case presses ; so do pray cure her for me . Or at least tell me what her Indisposition is . ”
26808	26829	26843	26844	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Oh ! What ! did n't I tell you ? Well , there 's nothing the matter with her . ”
26890	26897	26899	26899	he	357	“ There now , Miss Julia , ”

27161	27204	27121	27121	Julia	255	“ No , mamma , if you please , not to put me off so transparently . If I had interrupted , and shouted , and behaved so , you would have packed me off to bed , or somewhere , directly . ”
27205	27220	27136	27137	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Do n't say ' packed , ' love . Dismissed me to bed . ”
27221	27224	27226	27226	Julia	255	“ Ah ! ”
27228	27249	27226	27226	Julia	255	“ that privileged person is gone , and we must all mind our P 's and Q 's once more . ”
27282	27287	27289	27289	she	253	“ And I suppose , ”
27293	27324	27289	27289	she	253	“ we must accept these extraordinary people as we find them . But that is no reason why you should say ' P 's and Q 's , ' darling . ”

So I thought then oh ! how different it must be from most books , if you can sit by the glorious sea and even look at it . So I sent for it directly , and , would you believe , it was an ignoble thing ; all flirtations and curates . The sea indeed ! A pond would be fitter to read it by ; and one with a good many geese on . ”
27684	27690	27692	27693	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Was ever such simplicity ! ”
27695	27818	27819	27819	She	253	“ Why , my dear , that phrase about the sea does not mean anything . I shall have you believing that Mr. So - and - So , a novelist , can ' wither fashionable folly , '' and that ' a painful incident '' to one shopkeeper has ' thrown a gloom '' over a whole market - town , and so on . Now - a - days every third phrase is of this character ; a starling 's note . Once , it appears , there was an age of gold , and then came one of iron , and then of brass . All these are gone , and the age of ' jargon ' has succeeded . ”

But what fundamental truth d'our novelists iver convey ? All they can do is pile incidents . Their customers dictate th ' article : unideaed melodrams for unideaed girls . The writers and their feckshins belong to one species , and that 's ' the non - vertebrated animals ; ' and their midicine is Bosh ; why , they bleed still for falls and fevers ; and niver mention vital chronometry . Then they do n't look straight at Nature , but see with their ears , and repeat one another twelve deep . Now , listen me ! there are the cracters for an ' ideaed feckshin ' in Barkington , and I 'd write it , too , only I have n't time . ”
28042	28052	28033	28033	Julia	255	“ Romantic characters in Barkington ? Who ? who ? ”

28645	28755	28761	28762	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Only because he is one , ma'am . And that is no reason at all with ' the Six . ' He is a juveneel pidant and a puppy , and contradicts ivery new truth , bekase it is n't in Aristotle and th ' Eton Grammar ; and he 's such a chatterbox , ye ca n't get in a word idgeways ; and he and his sister — that 's my virgin martyr — are a farce . He keeps sneerin ' at her relijjin , and that puts her in such a rage , she threatens ' t ' intercede for him at the throne . ”

Nlistme ! You have detected the signs of a slight cerebral instability ; I have ascertained th ' absence of all physical cause : then why make this healthy pashint 's buddy a test - tube for poisons ? Sovereign drugs ( I deal with no other , I leave the nullities to the noodles ) are either counterpoisons or poisons , and here there is nothing to counterpoison at prisent . So I 'm for caushin , and working on the safe side th ' hidge , till we are less in the dark .

33593	33630	33560	33560	he	312	“ Oh , she is a new acquaintance , and not one to interest you . We only meet in the Lord ; I do not visit Albion Villa ; her mother is an amiable worldling . ”

No , no : — But let you and I cut High Church and Low Church , and be brother and sister . Do tell me in English where you meet Julia Dodd ; that 's a dear ; for young ladies ' meeting in the Lord ' conveys no positive idea to my mind . ”

33924	34061	34062	34063	The speaker	1731	“ We meet in it now and then , dear ; but she can hardly be said to have joined me : I have a district , you know ; but poor Mrs. Dodd will not allow Julia to enlist in the service . She visits independently , and by fits and starts ; and I am afraid she thinks more of comforting their perishable bodies than of feeding their souls . It was but the other day she confessed to me her backwardness to speak in the way of instruction to women as old as her mother . She finds it so much easier to let them run on about their earthly troubles : and of course it is much easier . Ah ! the world holds her still in some of its subtle meshes . ”

34165	34246	34160	34161	Miss Hardie	277	“ I would rather not , dear Alfred : the introduction could not be for her eternal good . Julia 's soul is in a very ticklish state ; she wavers as yet between this world and the other world ; and it wo n't do ; it wo n't do ; there is no middle path . You would very likely turn the scale , and then I should have fought against her everlasting welfare — my friend 's . ”

34437	34475	34373	34373	Alfred	312	“ Why should he ? He is in the flesh himself ; let the carnal introduce one another . I really must decline ; but I am very , very sorry that you feel hurt about it . ”

36523	36562	36514	36514	he	1075	” Julia begged hard to be excused : said she was in no humour for balls : and Mrs. Dodd objecting that the tickets had actually been purchased , she asked leave to send them to the Dartons . “
36594	36595	36592	36592	I	0	” “
36602	36607	36592	36592	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd . “
36624	36625	36592	36592	I	0	” “
36632	36737	36592	36592	I	0	” said Julia . She sat down and enclosed the tickets to Rose Darton , with a little sugared note . Sarah , being out , Elizabeth took it . Sarah met her at the gate , but did not announce her return : she lurked in ambush till Julia happened to go to her own room , then followed her , and handed Alfred 's missive , and watched her slily , and being herself expeditious as the wind in matters of the heart , took it for granted the enclosure was something very warm indeed ; so she said with feigned simplicity , “
36748	36787	36738	36738	I	0	” and retreated swelling with a secret , and tormented her fellow - servants all day with innuendoes dark as Erebus . Julia read the note again and again : her heart beat at those few ceremonious lines . “
36798	36804	36788	36788	He	1795	” she said to herself . “
36824	37114	36819	36819	he	1795	” She divined rightly ; on Wednesday , at ten , Alfred Hardie was in the ball - room . It was a magnificent room , well lighted , and at present not half filled , though dancing had commenced . The figure Alfred sought was not there ; and he wondered he had been so childish as to hope she would come to a city ball . He played the fine gentleman ; would not dance . He got near the door with another Oxonian , and tried to avenge himself for her absence on the townspeople who were there by quizzing them . But in the middle of this amiable occupation , and indeed in the middle of a sentence , he stopped short , and his heart throbbed , and he thrilled from head to foot ; for two ladies glided in at the door , and passed up the room with the unpretending composure of well - bred people . They were equally remarkable ; but Alfred saw only the radiant young creature in flowing muslin , with the narrowest sash in the room , and no ornament but a necklace of large pearls and her own vivid beauty . She had altered her mind about coming , with apologies for her vacillating disposition so penitent and disproportionate that her indulgent and unsuspecting mother was really quite amused . Alfred was not so happy as to know that she had changed her mind with his note . Perhaps even this knowledge could have added little to that exquisite moment , when , unhoped for , she passed close to him , and the fragrant air from her brushed his cheek , and seemed to whisper , “
37122	37212	36819	36819	he	1795	” HE did follow her , and , convinced that she would be engaged ten deep in five minutes , hustled up to the master of the ceremonies and begged an introduction . The great banker 's son was attended to at once . Julia saw them coming , as her sex can see , without looking . Her eyes were on fire , and a delicious blush on her cheeks , when the M. C. introduced Mr. Alfred Hardie with due pomp . He asked her to dance . “
37222	37227	37220	37220	sir	1075	” said she softly . “
37231	37236	37220	37220	sir	1075	” asked Hardie timidly . “
37240	37352	37353	37355	that little ensign	1799	” But when they had got so far they were both seized with bashful silence ; and just as Alfred was going to try and break it , Cornet Bosanquet , aged 18 , height 5 feet 4 inches , strutted up with clanking heel , and , glancing haughtily up at him , carried Julia off , like a steam - tug towing away some fair schooner . To these little thorns society treats all anxious lovers , but the incident was new to Alfred , and discomposed him ; and , besides , he had nosed a rival in Sampson 's prescription . So now he thought to himself , “
37362	37432	37353	37355	that little ensign	1799	” To get rid of Mrs. Dodd he offered to conduct her to a seat . She thanked him ; she would rather stand where she could see her daughter dance : on this he took her to the embrasure of a window opposite where Julia and her partner stood , and they entered a circle of spectators . The band struck up , and the solemn skating began . “
37441	37449	37353	37355	that little ensign	1799	” asked a middle - aged solicitor . “
37462	37467	37453	37453	I	0	” replied his daughter . “
37475	37482	37485	37486	that girl	8891	” said the gentleman , loudly . “
37508	37509	37453	37453	I	0	” “
37520	37526	37453	37453	I	0	” suggested another Barkingtonian nymph . “
37532	37537	37453	37453	I	0	” said a third : “
37543	37544	37453	37453	I	0	” “
37551	37556	37453	37453	I	0	” ejaculated a fourth : “
37574	37575	37453	37453	I	0	” “
37578	37618	37453	37453	I	0	” muttered Alfred , and quivered all over : and he felt to Mrs. Dodd so like a savage going to spring , that she laid her hand upon his wrist , and said gently , but with authority , “
37633	37677	37453	37453	I	0	” Then they threw dirt on her bouquet , and then on her shoes , while she was winding in and out before their eyes a Grace , and her soft muslin drifting and flowing like an appropriate cloud round a young goddess . “
37699	37700	37701	37701	I	0	” “
37711	37712	37701	37701	I	0	” “
37718	37719	37720	37720	I	0	” “
37730	37731	37720	37720	I	0	” “
37737	37741	37720	37720	I	0	” whispered Alfred . “
37748	37753	37742	37742	I	0	” whispered Mrs. Dodd . “
37861	37912	37914	37914	you	1075	” All this with the utmost placidity . Then , as if to extinguish all doubt , Julia flung them a heavenly smile ; she had been furtively watching them all the time , and she saw they were talking about her . The other Oxonian squeezed up to Hardie . “
37924	37927	37929	37929	Hardie	312	“ Ah ! ”
37933	37973	37929	37929	Hardie	312	“ you mean that young lady with the court pearls , in that exquisite Indian muslin , which floats so gracefully , while the other muslin girls are all crimp and stiff ; like little pigs clad in crackling . ”
37974	37986	38015	38015	She	253	“ Ha ! ha ! ha ! Yes . Introduce me . ”
37987	38002	38003	38004	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ I could not take such a liberty with the queen of the ball . ”
38020	38030	38015	38015	She	253	“ Now here is a generous , impetuous thing . ”
38068	38077	38079	38079	one	8375	“ Who is the beauty of the ball ? ”
38083	38098	38079	38079	one	8375	“ I do n't know , but not that mawkish thing in limp muslin . ”
38099	38109	38111	38112	a third	9011	“ I should say Miss Hetherington is the belle , ”
38114	38120	38122	38126	the Oxonian coolly of Alfred	422	“ Which is Miss Hetherington ? ”
38128	38162	38122	38126	the Oxonian coolly of Alfred	422	“ Oh , she wo n't do for us . It is that little chalk - faced girl , dressed in pink with red roses ; the pink of vulgarity and bad taste . ”
38263	38280	38248	38248	He	420	“ Mrs. Dodd sends me to conduct you to her . With your permission , sir . ”
38341	38348	38329	38329	her	253	“ Why did mamma leave you ? ”
38349	38361	38377	38377	She	253	“ Miss Dodd , I am the most unhappy of men . ”
38362	38369	38371	38371	she	253	“ No doubt ! no doubt ! ”
38387	38401	38377	38377	She	253	“ and I shall be unhappy too if you go and displease mamma . ”
38402	38461	38462	38462	He	1828	“ What could I do ? A gang of snobbesses were detracting from — somebody . To speak plainly , they were running down the loveliest of her sex . Your mamma told me to keep quiet . And so I did till I got a fair chance , and then I gave it them in their teeth . ”
38470	38482	38462	38462	He	1828	“ I think I was very good not to kick them . ”
38495	38503	38505	38505	she	255	“ Oh ! most forbearing and considerate , ”
38507	38601	38505	38505	she	255	“ Ah ! by the way , I think I did hear some ladies express a misgiving as to the pecuniary value of my costume ; ha ! ha ! Oh — you — foolish!—Fancy noticing that ! Why it is in little sneers that the approval of the ladies shows itself at a ball , and it is a much sincerer compliment than the gentlemen 's bombastical praises : ' the fairest of her sex , ' and so on ; that none but the ' silliest of her sex ' believe . ”
38602	38620	38632	38642	Julia , whose spirits were mounting with the lights and music	1829	“ Miss Dodd , I never said the fairest of her sex . I said the loveliest . ”
38621	38630	38632	38642	Julia , whose spirits were mounting with the lights and music	1829	“ Oh , that alters the case entirely , ”
38649	38694	38632	38642	Julia , whose spirits were mounting with the lights and music	1829	“ so now come and be reconciled to the best and wisest of her sex ; ay , and the beautifullest , if you but knew her sweet , dear , darling face as I do . There she is ; let us fly . ”
38695	38715	38632	38642	Julia , whose spirits were mounting with the lights and music	1829	“ Mamma , here is a penitent for you , real or feigned , I do n't know which . ”
38716	38722	38724	38724	Alfred	422	“ Real , Mrs. Dodd , ”
38726	38765	38724	38724	Alfred	422	“ I had no right to disobey you and risk a scene . You served me right by abandoning me ; I feel the rebuke and its justice . Let me hope your vengeance will go no further . ”
38784	38829	38778	38778	he	422	“ I saw I had acquired a generous , hot - headed ally , who was bent on doing battle with insects ; so I withdrew ; but so I should at Waterloo , or anywhere else where people put themselves in a passion . ”
38836	38839	38841	38841	Julia	255	“ Ah ! ”
38843	38868	38841	38841	Julia	255	“ and I promised you this dance ; but it is a waltz and my guardian angel objects to the valse a deux temps . ”
38869	38904	38905	38905	Julia	255	“ Decidedly . Should all the mothers in England permit their daughters to romp and wrestle in public , and call it waltzing , I must stand firm till they return to their senses . ”
38921	38943	38911	38911	He	422	“ Well , perhaps it is a little rompy ; a donkey 's gallop and then twirl her like a mop . ”
38944	38956	38958	38959	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Since you admit that , perhaps you can waltz properly ? ”
38979	39002	39003	39003	Alfred	422	“ Then I can have the pleasure of dropping the tyrant . Away with you both while there is room to circulate . ”
39208	39218	39247	39248	shallow females	1838	“ Beautiful ! They are turning in the air . ”
39219	39232	39235	39236	shallow males	1836	“ Quite gone by . That 's how the old fogies dance . ”
39238	39244	39235	39236	shallow males	1836	“ How well she waltzes . ”
39250	39256	39245	39248	Chorus of shallow females	1837	“ How well he waltzes . ”
39311	39318	39321	39321	Julia	255	“ Ah ! I am happy ! ”
39332	39340	39323	39323	She	255	“ You dance very well , sir . ”
39357	39368	39370	39370	she	255	“ I think it is time to go to mamma , ”
39373	39387	39370	39370	she	255	“ So soon ? And I had so much to say to you . ”
39388	39399	39400	39402	The sudden facility	1840	“ Oh , very well . I am all attention . ”
39410	39464	39404	39405	set Alfred	422	“ I wanted to apologise to you for something — you are so good you seem to have forgotten it — but I dare not hope that — I mean at Henley — when the beauty of your character , and your goodness , so overpowered me , that a fatal impulse — — ”
39465	39473	39475	39475	Julia	255	“ What do you mean , sir ? ”
39504	39531	39497	39497	her	255	“ I never exchanged one word with you in my life before to - day ; and I never shall again if you pretend the contrary . ”
39544	39583	39532	39532	Alfred	422	“ I value your acquaintance highly , Mr. Hardie , now I have made it , as acquaintances are made ; but please to observe , I never saw you before — scarcely ; not even in church . ”
39584	39589	39591	39591	he	422	“ As you please , ”
39599	39608	39591	39591	he	422	“ What you say I 'll swear to . ”
39609	39628	39532	39532	Alfred	422	“ Then I say , never remind a lady of what you ought to wish her to forget . ”
39629	39645	39591	39591	he	422	“ I was a fool , and you are an angel of tact and goodness . ”
39646	39660	39662	39662	she	1841	“ Oh , now I am sure it is time to join mamma , ”
39670	39673	39662	39662	she	1841	“ Valsons . ”
39800	39807	39809	39810	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ The extravagance of these children ! ”
40114	40123	40124	40124	He	312	“ Quite unnecessary ; it is so near . ”
40328	40331	40325	40325	she	1859	“ a call ”
40535	40655	40529	40529	she	253	“ That young lady keeps me on thorns . I never feel secure she will not say or do something extravagant or unusual : she seems to suspect sobriety and good taste of being in league with impiety . Here I succeed in bridling her a little ; but encounter a female enthusiast in her own house ? merci ! After all , there must be something good in her , since she is your friend , and you are hers . But I have something more serious to say before you go there : it is about her brother . He is a flirt : in fact , a notorious one , more than one lady tells me . ”
40691	40695	40679	40679	She	255	“ the sex . ”
40696	40828	40679	40679	She	255	“ I hear he pays you compliments , and I have seen a disposition to single you out . Now , my love , you have the good sense to know that , whatever a young gentleman of that age says to you , he says to many other ladies ; but your experience is not equal to your sense ; so profit by mine . A girl of your age must never be talked of with a person of the other sex : it is fatal ; fatal ! but if you permit yourself to be singled out , you will be talked of , and distress those who love you . It is easy to avoid injudicious duets in society ; oblige me by doing so to - night . ”
40879	40888	40875	40875	she	255	“ And suppose he should esteem me seriously ? ”
40894	40904	40906	40906	she	253	“ Then that would be much worse . But , ”
40908	40955	40906	40906	she	253	“ I have no apprehensions on that score ; you are a child , and he is a precocious boy , and rather a flirt . But forewarned is forearmed . So now run away and dress , sweet one : my lecture is quite ended . ”
41008	41020	41022	41022	Julia	255	“ Oh , what will she say when she knows all ? ”
41119	41127	41116	41116	she	255	“ I am going to the school , ”
41212	41219	41203	41203	she	255	“ Cruel , cruel , cruel ! ”
41277	41345	41249	41250	a functionary	1878	“ As for you , my worthy sir ( turning to Edward ) , I shall just put you down without ceremony . But I must ask leave to book Captain Dodd . Mrs. Dodd , I come at the universal desire of the club ; they say it is sure to be a dull match without Captain Dodd . Besides , he is a capital player . ”
41346	41358	41360	41360	Edward	254	“ Mamma , do n't you be caught by his chaff , ”
41364	41383	41360	41360	Edward	254	“ Papa is no player at all . Anything more unlike cricket than his way of making runs ! ”
41384	41436	41249	41250	a functionary	1878	“ But he makes them , old fellow ; now you and I , at Lord 's the other day , played in first - rate form , left shoulder well up , and achieved — with neatness , precision , dexterity , and despatch — the British duck's - egg . “
41443	41448	41249	41250	a functionary	1878	” inquired Mrs. Dodd . “
41455	41468	41360	41360	Edward	254	” said the other Oxonian , coming to his friend 's aid . “
41476	41480	41360	41360	Edward	254	” Alfred told her “
41485	41490	41360	41360	Edward	254	” which had yielded to “
41496	41522	41523	41523	I	0	” and was becoming obsolete , meant the cypher set by the scorer against a player 's name who is out without making a run . “
41526	41531	41523	41523	I	0	” sighed Mrs. Dodd . “
41549	41550	41547	41547	British	427	” “
41565	41566	41547	41547	British	427	” “
41573	41574	41547	41547	British	427	” “
41602	41670	41598	41598	they	428	” In short , poor Alfred , though not an M. P. , was talking to put off time , till Julia should come in : so he now favoured Mrs. Dodd , of all people , with a flowery description of her husband 's play , which I , who have not his motive for volubility , suppress . However , he wound up with the captains “
41674	41675	41598	41598	they	428	” “
41679	41683	41684	41684	Barkington	430	” said he , “
41790	41843	41844	41844	Your	1889	” Mrs. Dodd smiled a little ironically at this tirade , but said she thought she might venture to promise Mr. Dodd 's co - operation , should he reach home in time . Then , to get rid of Alfred before Julia 's return , the amiable worldling turned to Edward . “
41871	41896	41865	41866	Mr. Hardie	312	” Alfred declined , and took his leave with far less alacrity than he had entered ; Edward went down - stairs with him . “
41904	41911	41897	41898	Miss Dodd	255	” asked Alfred , affecting carelessness . “
41930	41931	41923	41923	I	0	” “
41982	41983	41984	41984	I	0	” “
41990	41994	41984	41984	I	0	” said Edward . “
42006	42007	42004	42004	Julia	255	” “
42073	42074	42088	42088	she	255	” “
42079	42084	42088	42088	she	255	” said Edward calmly , “
42103	42104	42088	42088	she	255	” “
42168	42169	42170	42170	I	0	” “
42174	42195	42196	42196	Mamma	1053	” said Edward gravely . They parted . Where Alfred went the reader can perhaps guess ; Edward to luncheon . “
42198	42212	42196	42196	Mamma	1053	” said he , with that tranquillity which sat so well on him , “
42225	42251	42217	42218	Alfred Hardie	312	” Mrs. Dodd suppressed a start , and ( perhaps to gain time before replying sincerely ) said she had not the honour of knowing what “
42253	42256	42261	42261	her	255	” meant . “
42288	42289	42277	42277	He	312	” “
42294	42299	42292	42292	child	8636	” was the answer . “
42331	42450	42315	42315	I	0	” Edward did not relish her remark : it menaced more Spoons than one . However , he was not the man to be cast down at a word : he lighted a cigar , and strolled towards Hardie 's house . Mr. Hardie , senior , had left three days ago on a visit to London ; Miss Hardie received him ; he passed the afternoon in calm complacency , listening reverently to her admonitions , and looking her softly out of countenance , and into earthly affections , with his lion eyes . Meantime his remark , so far from really seeming foolish to Mrs. Dodd , was the true reason for her leaving him so abruptly “
42459	42935	42452	42455	this dear slow Thing	1906	” thought she . She must talk to Julia more seriously , and would go to the school at once . She went up - stairs , and put on her bonnet and shawl before the glass ; then moulded on her gloves , and came down equipped . On the stairs was a large window , looking upon the open field ; she naturally cast her eyes through it in the direction she was going , and what did she see but a young lady and gentleman coming slowly down the path towards the villa . Mrs. Dodd bit her lip with vexation , and looked keenly at them , to divine on what terms they were . And the more she looked the more uneasy she grew . The head , the hand , the whole body of a sensitive young woman walking beside him she loves , betray her heart to experienced eyes watching unseen ; and especially to female eyes . And why did Julia move so slowly , especially after that warning ? Why was her head averted from that encroaching boy , and herself so near him ? Why not keep her distance , and look him full in the face ? Mrs. Dodd 's first impulse was that of leopardesses , lionesses , hens , and all the mothers in nature ; to dart from her ambush and protect her young ; but she controlled it by a strong effort ; it seemed wiser to descry the truth , and then act with resolution : besides , the young people were now almost at the shrubbery ; so the mischief if any , was done . They entered the shrubbery . To Mrs. Dodd 's surprise and dismay , they did not come out this side so quickly . She darted her eye into the plantation ; and lo ! Alfred had seized the fatal opportunity foliage offers , even when thinnish : he held Julia 's hand , and was pleading eagerly for something she seemed not disposed to grant ; for she turned away and made an effort to leave him . But Mrs. Dodd , standing there quivering with maternal anxiety , and hot with shame , could not but doubt the sincerity of that graceful resistance . If she had been quite in earnest , Julia had fire enough in her to box the little wretch 's ears . She ceased even to doubt , when she saw that her daughter 's opposition ended in his getting hold of two hands instead of one , and devouring them with kisses , while Julia still drew her head and neck away , but the rest of her supple frame seemed to yield and incline , and draw softly towards her besieger by some irresistible spell . “
42942	43111	43112	43112	Mamma	1053	” gasped Mrs. Dodd aloud , and turned to hasten and part them ; but even as she curved her stately neck to go , she caught the lovers ' parting ; and a very pretty one too , if she could but have looked at it , as these things ought always to be looked at : artistically . Julia 's head and lovely throat , unable to draw the rest of her away , compromised : they turned , declined , drooped , and rested one half moment on her captor 's shoulder , like a settling dove : the next , she scudded from him , and made for the house alone . Mrs. Dodd , deeply indignant , but too wise to court a painful interview , with her own heart beating high , went into the drawing - room , and there sat down , to recover some little composure . But she was hardly seated when Julia 's innocent voice was heard calling “
43116	43242	43114	43114	mamma	1053	” and soon she came bounding into the drawing - room , brimful of good news , her cheeks as red as fire and her eyes wet with happy tears ; and there confronted her mother , who had started up at her footstep , and now , with one hand nipping the back of the chair convulsively , stood lofty , looking strangely agitated and hostile . The two ladies eyed one another , silent , yet expressive , like a picture facing a statue ; but soon the colour died out of Julia 's face as well , and she began to cower with vague fears before that stately figure , so gentle and placid usually , but now so discomposed and stern . “
43250	43251	43248	43248	Julia	255	” “
43257	43261	43248	43248	Julia	255	” she faltered . “
43268	43269	43248	43248	Julia	255	” “
43283	43284	43281	43281	Alfred	312	” “
43298	43299	43291	43291	You	1053	” “
43339	43344	43346	43348	that young coquette	1913	” Mrs. Dodd groaned . “
43393	43433	43374	43374	you	1053	” And with these words her own courage began to give way , and she sank into a chair with a deep sigh . At this Julia screamed , and threw herself on her knees beside her , and cried “
43457	43475	43483	43483	your	1053	” and fell to sobbing so wildly that Mrs. Dodd altered her tone with almost ludicrous rapidity . “
43527	43543	43544	43544	He	1918	” In reply to this question , which she somewhat mistook , Julia sobbed out , “
43718	43719	43696	43696	I	0	” “
43737	43738	43696	43696	I	0	” “
43843	43853	43840	43840	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd bit her lip , and said , “
43860	43861	43840	43840	I	0	” “
43943	43944	43936	43936	him	1918	” “
43954	43955	43951	43951	him	1918	” “
44189	44263	44165	44173	my own , good , kind , darling mamma	1936	” A shower of tender tears gushed out in support of this appeal and in a moment she was caught up with Love 's mighty arms , and her head laid on her mother 's yearning bosom . No word was needed to reconcile these two . After a long silence , Mrs. Dodd said this would be a warning never to judge her sweet child from a distance again , nor unheard . “
44267	44271	44165	44173	my own , good , kind , darling mamma	1936	” said she , “
44304	44305	44306	44306	Mamma	275	” “
44308	44316	44306	44306	Mamma	275	” murmured Julia , hanging her head , “
44327	44334	44323	44324	each other	8455	” Mrs. Dodd looked all astonishment . “
44342	44353	44354	44354	I	0	” said Julia , impetuously , addressing some invisible obstacle . “
44368	44428	44429	44429	Mamma	275	” And with this out it all came . She told the story of her heart better than I have ; and , woman - like , dwelt on the depths of loyalty and delicate love she had read in Alfred 's moonlit face that night at Henley . She said no eloquence could have touched her like it . “
44453	44468	44469	44469	I	0	” She even tried to solve the mystery of her soi - disant sickness : “
44499	44500	44503	44503	darling	1074	” “
44524	44525	44521	44522	your mother	1411	” “
44618	44646	44647	44647	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd slighted this ingenious solution . She said , after a moment 's reflection , that the fault of this misunderstanding lay between the two . “
44706	44710	44711	44711	I	0	” She added : “
44740	44792	44793	44794	Your papa	1955	” Next day Alfred came to know his fate . He was received with ceremonious courtesy . At first he was a good deal embarrassed , but this was no sooner seen than it was relieved by Mrs. Dodd with tact and gentleness . When her turn came , she said , “
44806	44816	44798	44798	you	275	” Alfred looked a little confused , and said , “
44831	44832	44819	44819	he	1955	” “
44837	44842	44819	44819	he	1955	” said Mrs. Dodd . “
44873	44897	44855	44855	I	0	” Alfred replied that he was well aware of that , and that he knew his father , and could answer for him . “
44901	44906	44855	44855	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd , “
44924	44932	44916	44916	I	0	” Alfred would write by this post . “
44939	44943	44916	44916	I	0	” said he , “
44980	45064	45065	45065	I	0	” He then delivered a glowing eulogy on his father ; and Mrs. Dodd , to whom the boy 's character was now a grave and anxious study , saw with no common satisfaction his cheek flush and his eyes moisten as he dwelt on the calm , sober , unvarying affection , and reasonable indulgence he and his sister had met with all their lives from the best of parents . Returning to the topic of topics , he proposed an engagement . “
45073	45091	45065	45065	I	0	” said this brisk wooer , looking down . But this Mrs. Dodd thought premature and unnecessary . “
45098	45102	45065	45065	I	0	” said she , “
45120	45134	45113	45113	you	1959	” But , upon being warmly pressed , she half conceded even this . “
45137	45141	45113	45113	you	1959	” said she , “
45193	45194	45195	45197	Dear Mrs. Dodd	253	” “
45199	45203	45206	45206	you	253	” said Alfred , “
45232	45257	45258	45259	ALBION VILLA	1963	” added he , naively . Mrs. Dodd smiled , furnished him with writing materials , and left him , with a polite excuse . “
45264	45558	45559	45561	My dear father	1964	“ MY DEAR FATHER,—You are too thorough a man of the world , and too well versed in human nature , to be surprised at hearing that I , so long invulnerable , have at last formed a devoted attachment to one whose beauty , goodness , and accomplishments I will not now enlarge upon ; they are indescribable , and you will very soon see them and judge for yourself . The attachment , though short in weeks and months , has been a very long one in hopes , and fears , and devotion . I should have told you of it before you left , but in truth I had no idea I was so near the goal of all my earthly hopes ; there were many difficulties : but these have just cleared away almost miraculously , and nothing now is wanting to my happiness but your consent . It would be affectation , or worse , in me to doubt that you will grant it . But , in a matter so delicate , I venture to ask you for something more : the mother of my ever and only beloved Julia is a lady of high breeding and sentiments : she will not let her daughter enter any family without a cordial invitation from its head . Indeed she has just told me so . I ask , therefore , not your bare consent , of which I am sure , since my happiness for life depends on it , but a consent so gracefully worded — and who can do this better than you?—as to gratify the just pride and sensibilities of the high - minded family about to confide its brightest ornament to my care . “
45621	45687	45695	45695	you	1964	“ Yet I do but yield to Nature 's universal law . And , should I be master of my own destiny , I will not go far from you . I have been unjust to Barkington : or rather I have echoed , without thought , Oxonian prejudices and affectation . On mature reflection , I know no better residence for a married man . “
45783	45804	45805	45806	ALFRED HARDlE.	436	“ Write to me by return , dear father , and believe me , ever your dutiful and grateful son , “
45807	45847	45848	45848	His	436	” As he concluded , Julia came in , and he insisted on her reading this masterpiece . She hesitated . Then he told her with juvenile severity that a good husband always shares his letters with his wife . “
45853	45860	45851	45851	Alfred	436	” and she coloured all over . “
45867	45878	45879	45879	I	0	” said she , turning it off after her fashion . “
45893	45894	45879	45879	I	0	” “
45903	45908	45909	45909	You	9069	” said Alfred gravely . “
45935	45936	45939	45939	you	9069	” “
45969	45999	45954	45954	I	0	” When he came to read it , he appreciated the delicacy that had tempered her curiosity . He did not read it all to her , but nearly . “
46006	46010	46015	46015	mamma	1053	” said she ; “
46101	46119	46098	46099	your highness	1980	” The gay creature dropt him a curtsey , and fled to tell Mrs. Dodd the substance of “
46132	46339	46123	46128	the dear high - flown Thing	1981	” By then he had folded and addressed it , she returned and brought her work : charity children 's great cloaks : her mother had cut them , and in the height of the fashion , to Jane Hardie 's dismay ; and Julia was binding , hooding , etcetering them . How demurely she bent her lovely head over her charitable work , while Alfred poured his tale into her ears ! How careful she was not to speak , when there was a chance of his speaking ! How often she said one thing so as to express its opposite , a process for which she might have taken out a patent ! How she and Alfred compared heart - notes , and their feelings at each stage of their passion ! Their hearts put forth tendril after tendril , and so curled , and clung , round each other . In the afternoon of the second blissful day , Julia suddenly remembered that this was dull for her mother . To have such a thought was to fly to her ; and she flew so swiftly that she caught Mrs. Dodd in tears , and trying adroitly and vainly to hide them . “
46356	46357	46350	46350	I	0	” “
46384	46385	46388	46388	mamma	1053	” “
46390	46396	46388	46388	mamma	1053	” said Julia , warmly , “
46481	46576	46577	46577	I	0	” Divine power of native eloquence : with this trite distich you made hexameters tame ; it gushed from that great young heart with a sweet infantine ardour , that even virtue can only pour when young , and youth when virtuous ; and , at the words I have emphasised by the poor device of capitals , two lovely , supple arms flew wide out like a soaring albatross 's wings , and then went all round the sad mother , and gathered every bit of her up to the generous young bosom . “
46585	46593	46594	46594	I	0	” cried Mrs. Dodd , kissing her ; “
46646	46653	46637	46637	you	1441	” And she contrived to smile . “
46673	46730	46731	46731	He	2001	” The next day Mrs. Dodd took Julia apart and asked her whether there was an answer from Mr. Hardie . Julia replied , from Alfred , that Jane had received a letter last night , and , to judge by the contents , Mr. Hardie must have left London before Alfred 's letter got there . “
46740	46741	46736	46738	poor Uncle Thomas	437	” “
46751	46752	46744	46744	you	0	” “
46774	46775	46766	46766	Alfred	312	” “
46782	46787	46776	46776	You	0	” cried Mrs. Dodd . “
46800	46801	46805	46805	mamma	1053	” “
46807	46816	46805	46805	mamma	1053	” said Julia , in a great hurry ; “
46825	46878	46879	46879	He	2001	” Mrs. Dodd 's lip curved at this Julian answer ; but just then her mind was more drawn to another topic . A serious doubt passed through her , whether , if Mr. Hardie did not write soon , she ought not to limit his son 's attendance on her daughter . “
46888	46928	46879	46879	He	2001	” said she half fretfully . Next day , by previous invitation , Dr. Sampson made Albion Villa his head - quarters . Darting in from London , he found Alfred sitting very close to Julia over a book . “
46931	46935	46929	46929	Lordsake	438	” cried he , “
46954	46968	46929	46929	Lordsake	438	” Julia turned scarlet , and Alfred ejaculated so loudly , that Sampson inquired “
46977	46978	46929	46929	Lordsake	438	” “
47018	47029	47016	47016	her	2001	” added he , turning suddenly from gratitude to revenge , “
47043	47044	47041	47041	doctor	8892	” “
47057	47063	47051	47051	I	0	” cried Julia in dismay . “
47070	47087	47051	47051	I	0	” said Sampson contentedly , and proceeded to dissect himself just as he would a stranger . “
47109	47110	47103	47107	a man of great mirit	2009	” “
47117	47122	47111	47113	All vain people	2010	” suggested Alfred dryly . “
47140	47141	47133	47133	Y	0	” “
47146	47147	47133	47133	Y	0	” “
47185	47186	47179	47179	Ovid	2013	” “
47206	47207	47202	47204	one Dr. Whately	347	” “
47215	47219	47208	47208	He	2014	” said Edward ; “
47236	47237	47231	47231	she	2012	” “
47259	47260	47231	47231	she	2012	” “
47274	47281	47231	47231	she	2012	” retorted the master of doggrel . “
47302	47319	47320	47320	I	0	” Julia settled the question by putting away the book . And she murmured to Alfred , “
47351	47390	47397	47397	ma'am	8773	” This sound remonstrance escaped criticism by being nearly inaudible , and by Mrs. Dodd entering at the same moment . After the first greeting , Sampson asked her with merry arrogance , how his prescription had worked ? “
47439	47440	47397	47397	ma'am	8773	” “
47445	47601	47397	47397	ma'am	8773	” said Mrs. Dodd reproachfully . Thus splashed Sampson among the ducks : one of them did not show her face again till dinner . Jane Hardie accompanied her brother by invitation . The general amity was diversified and the mirth nowise lessened by constant passages of arms between Messrs. Sampson and Alfred Hardie . After tea came the first contretemps . Sampson liked a game of cards : he could play , yet talk chronothermalism , as the fair can knit babies ' shoes and imbibe the poetasters of the day . Mrs. Dodd had asked Edward to bring a fresh pack . He was seen by his guardian angel to take them out of his pocket and undo them ; presently Sampson , in his rapid way , clutched hold of them ; and found a slip of paper curled round the ace of spades , with this written very clear in pencil , “
47606	47626	47397	47397	ma'am	8773	” cried Sampson , and read it out aloud . Jane Hardie coloured , and so betrayed herself . Her “
47630	47671	47755	47755	you	357	” had strayed . It was the young and comely Edward she wished to save from the diabolical literature , the painted perdition , and not the uninteresting old sinner Sampson , who proceeded to justify her preference by remarking that “
47684	47742	47682	47682	ladies	8585	” would be more to the point . Everybody , except this hardened personage , was thoroughly uncomfortable . As for Alfred , his face betrayed a degree of youthful mortification little short of agony . Mrs. Dodd was profoundly disgusted , but fortunately for the Hardies , caught sight of his burning cheeks and compressed lips . “
47746	47754	47755	47755	you	357	” said she , with cold dignity , “
47796	47803	47792	47792	I	0	” added she with great sweetness , “
47855	48141	47846	47847	Miss Hardie	277	” At this , Jane and Julia had an earnest conversation at the piano , and their words , uttered in a low voice , were covered by a contemporaneous discussion between Sampson and Mrs. Dodd . Jane . No , you must not ask me : I have forsworn these vanities . I have not opened my piano this two years . Julia . Oh , what a pity ; music is so beautiful ; and surely we can choose our songs , as easily as our words ; ah , how much more easily . Jane . Oh , I do n't go so far as to call music wicked : but music in society is such a snare . At least I found it so ; my playing was highly praised , and that stirred up vanity : and so did my singing , with which I had even more reason to be satisfied . Snares ! snares ! Julia . Goodness me ! I do n't find them so . Now you mention it , gentlemen do praise one ; but , dear me , they praise every lady , even when we have been singing every other note out of tune . The little unmeaning compliments of society , can they catch anything so great as a soul ? Jane . I pray daily not to be led into temptation , and shall I go into it of my own accord ? Julia . Not if you find it a temptation . At that rate I ought to decline . Jane . That does n't follow . My conscience is not a law to yours . Besides , your mamma said “
48144	48459	47846	47847	Miss Hardie	277	” and a parent is not to be disobeyed upon a doubt . If papa were to insist on my going to a ball even , or reading a novel , I think I should obey ; and lay the whole case before Him . Mrs. Dodd ( from a distance ) . Come , my dears , Dr. Sampson is getting so impatient for your song . Sampson . Hum ! for all that , young ladies ' singing is a poor substitute for cards , and even for conversation . Mrs. Dodd . That depends upon the singer , I presume . Sampson . Mai — dear — madam , they all sing alike ; just as they all write alike . I can hardly tell one fashionable tune from another ; and nobody can tell one word from another , when they cut out all the consonants . N ' listen me . This is what I heard sung by a lady last night . Mrs. Dodd . That sounds like gibberish . Sampson . It is gibberish , but it 's Drydenish in articulating mouths . It is — Mrs. Dodd . I think you exaggerate . I will answer for Julia that she shall speak as distinctly to music as you do in conversation . Sampson ( all unconscious of the tap ) . Time will show , madam . At prisent they seem to be in no hurry to spatter us with their word - jelly . Does some spark of pity linger in their marble bos'ms ? or do they prefer inaud'ble chit - chat t ' inarticulate mewing ? Julia , thus pressed , sang one of those songs that come and go every season . She spoke the words clearly , and with such variety and intelligence , that Sampson recanted , and broke in upon the—“very
48460	48461	48559	48559	she	2027	pretty”—“how sweet”—and
48462	48468	47846	47847	Miss Hardie	277	“ who is it by ? ”
48476	48515	48516	48516	Alfred	312	“ Very weak trash very cleanly sung . Now give us something worth the wear and tear of your orgins . Immortal vairse widded t ' immortal sounds ; that is what I understand b ' a song . ”
48519	48534	48516	48516	Alfred	312	“ No , no , dearest ; sing something suitable to you and me . ”
48535	48554	48555	48555	He	312	“ Out of the question . Then go farther away , dear ; I shall have more courage . ”
49278	49285	49287	49287	she	1036	“ Are you unwell , dear ? ”
49291	49296	49287	49287	she	1036	“ No , love . ”
49297	49306	49335	49335	her	253	“ Is there anything the matter , then ? ”
49307	49321	49287	49287	she	1036	“ Hush ! We have guests : our first duty is to them . ”
49434	49475	49413	49413	she	253	“ I always thought you the most lovable child I ever saw ; but I never admired you as I have to - night , my noble , my beautiful daughter , who would grace the highest family in England . ”
49507	49512	49514	49514	Julia	255	“ My own mamma , ”
49517	49522	49514	49514	Julia	255	“ what has happened ? ”
49523	49527	49529	49530	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ My darling , ”
49536	49545	49529	49530	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ have you pride ? have you spirit ? ”
49546	49552	49514	49514	Julia	255	“ I think I have . ”
49553	49568	49570	49570	she	253	“ I hope so : for you will need them both . Read that ! ”
49596	49740	49570	49570	she	253	“ MADAM,—I have received a very juvenile letter from my son , by which I learn he has formed a sudden attachment to your daughter . He tells me , however , at the same time , that you await my concurrence before giving your consent . I appreciate your delicacy ; and it is with considerable regret I now write to inform you this match is out of the question . I have thought it due to you to communicate this to yourself and without delay , and feel sure that you will , under the circumstances , discountenance my son 's further visits at your house — I am , Madam , with sincere respect , your faithful servant , Julia read this letter , and re - read it in silence . It was an anxious moment to the mother . “
49751	49755	49570	49570	she	253	” she faltered . “
49766	49767	49758	49758	yourself	0	” “
49789	49799	49781	49781	Hardie	264	” This reply was very comforting to Mrs. Dodd . “
49813	49814	49801	49801	I	0	” “
49856	49857	49840	49840	You	0	” “
49865	49870	49858	49858	I	0	” Life seems ended . “
49898	50126	50128	50128	I	0	” While Mrs. Dodd wrote to Alfred Hardie , Julia sank down and laid her head on her mother 's knees . The note was shown her ; she approved it languidly . A long and sad conversation followed ; and , after kissing her mother and clinging to her , she went to bed chilly and listless , but did not shed a single tear . Her young heart was benumbed by the unexpected blow . Next morning early , Alfred Hardie started gaily to spend the day at Albion Villa . Not a hundred yards from the gate he met Sarah , with Mrs. Dodd 's letter , enclosing a copy of his father 's to her . Mrs. Dodd here reminded him that his visits had been encouraged only upon a misapprehension of his father 's sentiments ; for which misapprehension he was in some degree to blame : not that she meant to reproach him on that score , especially at this unhappy moment : no , she rather blamed herself for listening to the sanguine voice of youth ; but the error must now be repaired . She and Julia would always wish him well , and esteem him , provided he made no further attempt to compromise a young lady who could not be his wife . The note concluded thus — “
50236	50240	50229	50229	He	312	“ Very well ! ”
50330	50689	50322	50322	He	312	“ DEAR MRS . DODD,—I have gained some victories in my life ; but not one without two defeats to begin with ; how then can I expect to obtain such a prize as dear Julia without a check or two ? You need not fear that I shall intrude after your appeal to me as a gentleman : but I am not going to give in because my father has written a hasty letter from Yorkshire . He and I must have many a talk face to face before I consent to be miserable for life . Dear Mrs. Dodd , at first receipt of your cruel letter , so kindly worded , I was broken - hearted ; but now I am myself again : difficulties are made for ladies to yield to , and for men to conquer . Only for pity 's sake do not you be my enemy ; do not set her against me for my father 's fault . Think , if you can , how my heart bleeds at closing this letter without one word to her I love better , a thousand times better , than my life — I am , dear Mrs. Dodd , yours sorrowfully , but not despairing , Mrs. Dodd kept this letter to herself . She could not read it quite unmoved , and therefore she felt sure it would disturb her daughter 's heart the more . Alfred had now a soft but dangerous antagonist in Mrs. Dodd . All the mother was in arms to secure her daughter 's happiness , coute qu'il coute ! and the surest course seemed to be to detach her affections from Alfred . What hope of a peaceful heart without this ? and what real happiness without peace ? But , too wise and calm to interfere blindly , she watched her daughter day and night , to find whether Love or Pride was the stronger , and this is what she observed — Julia never mentioned Alfred . She sought occupation eagerly : came oftener than usual for money , saying , it was for “
50692	50749	50750	50750	Mamma	1053	” She visited the poor more constantly , taking one of the maids with her , at Mrs. Dodd 's request . She studied Logic with Edward . She went to bed rather early , fatigued , it would appear , by her activity : and she gave the clue to her own conduct one day : “
50752	50756	50750	50750	Mamma	1053	” said she , “
50765	50838	50840	50840	her	2081	” Mrs. Dodd noticed also a certain wildness and almost violence , with which she threw herself into her occupations , and a worn look about the eyes that told of a hidden conflict . On the whole Mrs. Dodd was hopeful ; for she had never imagined the cure would be speedy or easy . To see her child on the right road was much . Only the great healer Time could “
50850	50906	50840	50840	her	2081	” and even Time can not give her back her childhood , thought the mother , with a sigh . One day came an invitation to an evening party at a house where they always wound up with dancing . Mrs. Dodd was for declining as usual for since that night Julia had shunned parties . “
50917	50922	50840	50840	her	2081	” was her cry ; “
50937	50951	50840	50840	her	2081	” But now she caught with a sort of eagerness at this invitation . “
50964	50965	50954	50954	They	2084	” “
50970	50976	50954	50954	They	2084	” said Mrs. Dodd joyfully , “
51013	51014	51038	51038	he	2088	” “
51021	51025	51038	51038	he	2088	” said Julia ; “
51045	51072	51038	51038	he	2088	” She was the life and soul of the party , and , indeed , so feverishly brilliant , that Mrs. Dodd said softly to her , “
51094	51162	51163	51167	a long - headed man	2091	” Meantime it cost Alfred Hardie a severe struggle to keep altogether aloof from Julia . In fact , it was a state of daily self - denial , to which he would never have committed himself , but that he was quite sure he could gradually win his father over . At his age we are apt to count without our antagonist . Mr. Richard Hardie was “
51169	51421	51163	51167	a long - headed man	2091	” He knew the consequence of giving one 's reasons : eternal discussion ending in war . He had taken care not to give any to Mrs. Dodd , and he was as guarded and reserved with Alfred . The young man begged to know the why and the wherefore , and being repulsed , employed all his art to elicit them by surprise , or get at them by inference : but all in vain . Hardie senior was impenetrable ; and inquiry , petulance , tenderness , logic , were all shattered on him as the waves break on Ailsa Craig . Thus began dissension , decently conducted at first , between a father indulgent hitherto and an affectionate son . In this unfortunate collision of two strong and kindred natures , every advantage was at present on the father 's side : age , experience , authority , resolution , hidden and powerful motives , to which my reader even has no clue as yet ; a purpose immutable and concealed . Add to these a colder nature and a far colder affection ; for Alfred loved his father dearly . At last , one day , the impetuous one lost his self - command , and said he was a son , not a slave , and had little respect for Authority when afraid or ashamed to appeal to Reason . Hardie senior turned on him with a gravity and dignity no man could wear more naturally . “
51436	51437	51441	51441	father	2093	” “
51471	51472	51463	51463	you	312	” “
51495	51496	51476	51499	one of those interfering , pragmatical fathers who can not let their children enjoy themselves their own way ? ” “ No , sir	2094	” “
51514	51515	51518	51519	the one	2097	” “
51584	51764	51768	51768	him	2100	” Alfred was overpowered by the weight and solemnity of this . Sorrow , vexation , and despondency all rushed into his heart together , and unmanned him for a moment ; he buried his face in his hands , and something very like a sob burst from his young heart . At this Hardie senior took up the newspaper with imperturbable coldness , and wore a slight curl of the lip . All this was hardly genuine , for he was not altogether unmoved ; but he was a man of rare self - command , and chose to impress on Alfred that he was no more to be broken or melted than a mere rock . It is always precarious to act a part ; and this cynicism was rather able than wise : Alfred looked up and watched him keenly as he read the monetary article with tranquil interest ; and then , for the first time in his life , it flashed into the young man 's mind that his father was not a father . “
51772	51776	51768	51768	him	2100	” thought he . “
51782	51843	51777	51778	This man	2101	” Thus a gesture , so to speak , sowed the first seed of downright disunion in Richard Hardie 's house — disunion , a fast - growing plant , when men set it in the soil of the passions . Alfred , unlike Julia , had no panacea . Had any lips , except perhaps hers , told him that “
51854	51860	51777	51778	This man	2101	” he would have replied : “
51868	52090	52091	52091	Cupid	353	” It never occurred to him , therefore , to go out of himself , and sympathise with the sordid sorrows of the poor , and their bottomless egotism in contact with the well - to - do . He brooded on his own love , and his own unhappiness , and his own father 's cruelty . His nights were sleepless and his days leaden . He tried hard to read for his first class , but for once even ambition failed : it ended in flinging books away in despair . He wandered about dreaming and moping for some change , and bitterly regretting his excessive delicacy , which had tied his own hands and brought him to a stand - still . He lost his colour and what little flesh he had to lose ; for such young spirits as this are never plump . In a word , being now strait - jacketed into feminine inactivity , while void of feminine patience , his ardent heart was pining and fretting itself out . He was in this condition , when one day Peterson , his Oxonian friend , burst in on him open - mouthed with delight , and , as usual with bright spirits of this calibre , did not even notice his friend 's sadness . “
52099	52118	52091	52091	Cupid	353	” as Shakespeare hath it ; and it was a deal nicer than the bum - bailiff rheumatism . “
52161	52177	52179	52182	such a jolly girl	2105	” Then followed a rapturous description of the lady 's person , well worth omitting . “
52250	52251	52252	52252	You	2104	” “
52260	52269	52252	52252	You	2104	” groaned Alfred , turning sick at heart . “
52307	52308	52291	52291	her	2103	” “
52312	52313	52317	52317	they	2106	” “
52395	52512	52391	52393	a gone coon	2114	” This news put Alfred in a phrensy of indignation and fear . Julia dancing the cachouka ! Julia a jolly girl ! Julia singing songs pathetic or merry , whichever were asked for ! The heartless one ! He called to mind all he had read in the classics , and elsewhere , about the fickleness of woman . But this impression did not last long ; he recalled Julia 's character , and all the signs of a love tender and true she had given him . He read her by himself , and , lover - like , laid all the blame on another . It was all her cold - blooded mother . “
52687	52812	52681	52685	her cold - blooded mother	9259	” The above sentences , of course , were never uttered . But they represent his thoughts accurately , though in a condensed form , and are , as it were , a miniature of this young heart boiling over . From that moment he lay in wait for her , and hovered about the house day and night , determined to appeal to her personally , and undeceive her , and baffle her mother 's treachery . But at this game he was soon detected : Mrs. Dodd lived on the watch now . Julia , dressed to go out , went to the window one afternoon to look at the weather ; but retreated somewhat hastily and sat down on the sofa . “
52818	52823	52813	52813	You	2129	” said Mrs. Dodd . “
52830	52831	52826	52826	he	2127	” “
52834	52835	52826	52826	he	2127	” “
52844	52845	52836	52836	You	2129	” “
52873	52926	52871	52871	Alfred	312	” She went to her own room and prayed for him . She informed the Omniscient that , though much greater and better in other respects than she was , he had not Patience . She prayed , with tears , that he might have Christian patience granted Him from on high . “
52935	52994	52931	52931	she	275	” said Alfred , outside . He had seen her in her bonnet . Mrs. Dodd waited several days to see whether this annoyance would not die of itself : waiting was her plan in most things . Finding he was not to be tired out , she sent Sarah out to him with a note carefully sealed . “
53017	53086	52931	52931	she	275	“ Mrs. Dodd,—Is all the generosity and all the good faith to be on one side?—Yours in despair , Mrs. Dodd coloured faintly : the reproach pricked her , but did not move her . She sat quietly down that moment , and wrote to a friend in London , to look out for a furnished villa in a healthy part of the suburbs , with immediate possession . “
53089	53093	52931	52931	she	275	” said she , “
53108	53237	52931	52931	she	275	” The Bosanquets gave a large party ; Mrs. and Miss Dodd were there . The latter was playing a part in a charade to the admiration of all present , when in came Mr. Peterson , introducing his friend , Alfred Hardie . Julia caught the name , and turned a look of alarm on her mother , but went on acting . Presently she caught sight of him at some distance . He looked very pale , and his glittering eye was fixed on her with a sort of stern wonder . Such a glance from fiery eyes , that had always dwelt tenderly on her till then , struck her like a weapon . She stopped short , and turned red and pale by turns . “
53245	53322	52931	52931	she	275	” said she bitterly , and went and sat by Mrs. Dodd . The gentlemen thronged round her with compliments , and begged her to sing . She excused herself . Presently she heard an excited voice , towards which she dared not look ; it was inquiring whether any lady could sing Aileen Aroon . With every desire to gratify the young millionaire , nobody knew Aileen Aroon , nor had ever heard of it . “
53327	53331	52931	52931	she	275	” cried Alfred . “
53356	53357	53350	53350	they	8585	” “
53360	53365	53358	53358	Mamma	275	” whispered Julia terrified , “
53381	53382	53377	53377	He	2134	” “
53388	53393	53377	53377	He	2134	” said Mrs. Dodd , “
53399	53424	53425	53425	I	0	” She rose and glided up to Alfred Hardie , looked coldly in his face ; then said with external politeness and veiled contempt , “
53438	53657	53425	53425	I	0	” She waved her hand , and he followed her sulkily to the piano . She sung Aileen Aroon , not with her daughter 's eloquence , but with a purity and mellowness that charmed the room : they had never heard the genius sing it . As spirits are said to overcome the man at whose behest they rise , so this sweet air , and the gush of reminiscence it awakened , overpowered him who had evoked them ; Alfred put his Hand unconsciously to his swelling heart , cast one look of anguish at Julia , and hurried away half choked . Nobody but Julia noticed . A fellow in a rough great - coat and tattered white hat opened the fly door for Mrs. Dodd . As Julia followed her , he kissed her skirt unseen by Mrs. Dodd , but her quick ears caught a heart - breaking sigh . She looked and recognised Alfred in that disguise ; the penitent fit had succeeded to the angry one . Had Julia observed ? To ascertain this without speaking of him , Mrs. Dodd waited till they had got some little distance , then quietly put out her hand and rested it for a moment on her daughter 's ; the girl was trembling violently “
53661	53694	53658	53659	Little wretch	2136	” came to Mrs. Dodd 's lips , but she did not utter it . They were near home before she spoke at all , and then she only said very kindly , “
53708	53795	53658	53659	Little wretch	2136	” a remark intended quietly to cover the last occurrence as well as Alfred 's open persecution . They had promised to go out the very next day ; but Mrs. Dodd went alone , and made excuses for Miss Dodd . On her return she found Julia sitting up for her , and a letter come from her friend describing a pleasant cottage , now vacant , near Maida Vale . Mrs. Dodd handed the open letter to Julia ; she read it without comment . “
53817	53818	53821	53821	mamma	1053	” “
53823	53926	53821	53821	mamma	1053	” I am now about to relate a circumstance by no means without parallels , but almost impossible to account for ; and , as nothing is more common and contemptible than inadequate solutions , I will offer none at all : but so it was , that Mrs. Dodd awoke in the middle of that very night in a mysterious state of mental tremor ; trouble , veiled in obscurity , seemed to sit heavy on her bosom . So strong , though vague , was this new and mysterious oppression , that she started up in bed and cried aloud , “
53934	54169	53927	53927	David!—Julia!—Oh	454	” The sound of her own voice dispelled the cloud in part , but not entirely . She lay awhile , and then finding herself quite averse to sleep , rose and went to her window , and eyed the weather anxiously . It was a fine night ; soft fleecy clouds drifted slowly across a silver moon . The sailor 's wife was reassured on her husband 's behalf . Her next desire was to look at Julia sleeping ; she had no particular object : it was the instinctive impulse of an anxious mother whom something had terrified . She put on her slippers and dressing - gown , and , lighting a candle at her night - lamp , opened her door softly and stepped into the little corridor . But she had not taken two steps when she was arrested by a mysterious sound . It came from Julia 's room . What was it ? Mrs. Dodd glided softly nearer and nearer , all her senses on the stretch . The sound came again . It was a muffled sob . The stifled sound , just audible in the dead stillness of the night , went through and through her who stood there listening aghast . Her bowels yearned over her child , and she hurried to the door , but recollected herself , and knocked , very gently . “
54187	54264	54183	54183	I	0	” She did not wait for the answer , but turned the handle and entered . She found Julia sitting up in bed , looking wildly at her , with cheeks flushed and wet . She sat on the bed and clasped her to her breast in silence : but more than one warm tear ran down upon Julia 's bare neck ; the girl felt them drop , and her own gushed in a shower . “
54272	54276	54183	54183	I	0	” she sobbed . “
54285	54336	54278	54278	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd did not immediately reply . She was there to console , and her admirable good sense told her that to do that she must be calmer than her patient ; so even while she kissed and wept over Julia , she managed gradually to recover her composure . “
54343	54347	54278	54278	I	0	” said she , “
54381	54382	54374	54374	you	1441	” “
54483	54484	54481	54481	me	0	” “
54489	54504	54481	54481	me	0	” said Mrs. Dodd , struggling with the emotion these simple words caused her . “
54510	54516	54517	54517	I	0	” cried Julia , impetuously . “
54536	54537	54517	54517	I	0	” “
54597	54631	54632	54632	I	0	” At this point - blank question Julia put her head over Mrs. Dodd 's shoulder , not to be seen ; and , clasping her tight , murmured scarce above a whisper , “
54802	54803	54798	54798	I	0	” “
54808	54814	54798	54798	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd soothingly . “
54836	54853	54825	54825	I	0	” Julia opened her eyes , and was a good deal agitated as well as surprised . “
54861	54865	54866	54866	We	2153	” she gasped . “
54887	54888	54889	54889	Me	0	” “
54945	54946	54941	54943	Mr. Richard Hardie	264	” “
54952	54956	54957	54957	His	312	” sighed Julia . “
54977	54987	54970	54970	I	0	” And she was abashed . She resumed hastily , “
55040	55041	55042	55043	Little simpleton	2164	” “
55045	55055	55042	55043	Little simpleton	2164	” said Mrs. Dodd , and kissed her tenderly ; “
55129	55169	55114	55114	I	0	” Julia lay silent , and wondering what she could mean . But Mrs. Dodd hesitated now : it pained and revolted her to show her enthusiastic girl the world as it is . She said as much , and added—“I
55194	55195	55192	55192	me	0	” “
55202	55210	55192	55192	me	0	” cried Julia in her ardent way ; “
55220	55250	55192	55192	me	0	” Mrs. Dodd replied only by a sigh : grand general sentiments like that never penetrated her mind : they glided off like water from a duck 's back . “
55261	55279	55257	55257	Brutus	455	” said she , with such a curl of the lip . Brutus had rejected her daughter . “
55823	55824	55825	55825	Mamma	275	” “
55827	55828	55825	55825	Mamma	275	” “
56143	56144	56122	56122	he	264	” “
56152	56153	56122	56122	he	264	” “
56493	56510	56513	56513	mamma	1053	” And Mrs. Placid 's teeth made a little click just audible in the silent night . “
56530	56539	56540	56540	You	0	” Mrs. Dodd sighed , but said calmly , “
56639	56640	56641	56641	Mamma	275	” “
56649	56650	56641	56641	Mamma	275	” “
56699	56700	56701	56701	Mamma	275	” “
56703	56710	56701	56701	Mamma	275	” cried Julia , embracing her , “
56722	56723	56713	56714	poor girls	2255	” “
56729	56788	56713	56714	poor girls	2255	” was the grave reply . Mrs. Dodd then begged her to go to sleep , like a good child , for her health 's sake ; all would be well ; and with this was about to return to her own room ; but a white hand and arm darted out of the bed and caught her . “
56827	56841	56845	56845	Hope	392	” And she patted the bed expressively , and with the prettiest impatience . “
56852	56857	56845	56845	Hope	392	” suggested Mrs. Dodd . “
56870	56871	56875	56875	you	392	” “
56886	56981	56982	56982	He	2259	” Mrs. Hope quietly removed her earrings , and the tender pair passed the rest of the night in one another 's arms . The young girl 's tears were dried ; and hope revived , and life bloomed again : only , henceforth her longing eyes looked out to sea for her father , homeward bound . Next day , as they were seated together in the drawing - room , Julia came from the window with a rush , and kneeled at Mrs. Dodd 's knees , with bright imploring face upturned . “
56999	57000	56988	56988	I	0	” “
57008	57015	56988	56988	I	0	” was the somewhat oblique reply . “
57025	57169	56988	56988	I	0	” She was ten minutes putting them on : Julia tried to expedite her and retarded her . She had her pace , and could not go beyond it . Now by this time Alfred Hardie was thoroughly miserable . Unable to move his father , shunned by Julia , sickened by what he had heard , and indeed seen , of her gaiety and indifference to their separation , stung by jealousy and fretted by impatience , he was drinking nearly all the bitters of that sweet passion , Love . But as you are aware , he ascribed Julia 's inconstancy , lightness , and cruelty all to Mrs. Dodd . He hated her cordially , and dreaded her into the bargain ; he played the sentinel about her door all the more because she had asked him not to do it “
57179	57262	56988	56988	I	0	” said he , applying to his own case the wisdom of a Greek philosopher , one of his teachers . So , when the gate suddenly opened , and instead of Julia , this very Mrs. Dodd walked towards him , his feelings were anything but enviable . He wished himself away , heartily , but was too proud to retreat . He stood his ground . She came up to him ; a charming smile broke out over her features . “
57268	57272	57265	57266	Mr. Hardie	312	” said she , “
57288	57298	57282	57282	you	312	” He assented with surprise and an ill grace . “
57305	57377	57300	57300	I	0	” He offered it with a worse . She laid her hand lightly on it , and it shuddered at her touch . He felt like walking with a velvet tigress . By some instinct she divined his sentiment , and found her task more difficult than she had thought ; she took some steps in silence . At last , as he was no dissembler , he burst out passionately , “
57384	57385	57386	57386	I	0	” “
57392	57397	57386	57386	I	0	” said she quietly . “
57431	57432	57423	57429	a cruel , hard - hearted lady	2268	” “
57441	57447	57435	57435	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd simply . “
57477	57478	57468	57468	you	0	” “
57555	57560	57545	57545	I	0	” He retorted bitterly . “
57581	57582	57570	57570	you	0	” “
57595	57600	57583	57583	I	0	” said she archly . “
57626	57686	57687	57687	I	0	” In the lane she told him quietly she knew the nature of his father 's objections to the alliance he had so much at heart , and they were objections which her husband , on his return , would remove . On this he changed his tone a little , and implored her piteously not to deceive him . “
57691	57695	57687	57687	I	0	” said she , “
57772	57914	57764	57764	We	2278	” This was hard to resist and at his age . His lip trembled , he hesitated , but at last gave her his hand . She walked two hours with him , and laid herself out to enlighten , soothe , and comfort his sore heart His hopes and happiness revived under her magic , as Julia 's had . In the midst of it all , the wise woman quietly made terms . He was not to come to the house but on her invitation , unless indeed he had news of the Agra to communicate ; but he might write once a week to her , and enclose a few lines to Julia . On this concession he proceeded to mumble her white wrist , and call her his best , dearest , loveliest friend ; his mother . “
57919	57929	57764	57764	We	2278	” said he , with a relic of distrust , “
57942	57965	57966	57966	My	0	” That touched her . Hitherto , he had been to her but a thing her daughter loved . Her eyes filled . “
57976	57980	57966	57966	My	0	” she said , “
58002	58490	57966	57966	My	0	” So now two more bright eyes looked longingly seaward for the Agra homeward bound . NORTH latitude 23.5 , longitude east 113 ; the time March of this same year ; the wind southerly ; the port Whampoa , in the Canton river . Ships at anchor reared their tall masts here and there , and the broad stream was enlivened and coloured by junks and boats of all sizes and vivid hues , propelled on the screw principle by a great scull at the stern , with projecting handles , for the crew to work ; and at times a gorgeous mandarin boat , with two great glaring eyes set in the bows , came flying , rowed with forty paddles by an armed crew , whose shields hung on the gunwale and flashed fire in the sunbeams : the mandarin , in conical and buttoned hat , sitting on the top of his cabin calmly smoking Paradise , alias opium , while his gong boomed and his boat flew fourteen miles an hour , and all things scuttled out of his celestial way . And there , looking majestically down on all these water - ants , the huge Agra , cynosure of so many loving eyes and loving hearts in England , lay at her moorings ; homeward bound . Her tea not being yet on board , the ship 's hull floated high as a castle , and to the subtle , intellectual , doll - faced , bolus - eyed people that sculled to and fro busy as bees , though looking forked mushrooms , she sounded like a vast musical shell : for a lusty harmony of many mellow voices vibrated in her great cavities , and made the air ring cheerily around her . The vocalists were the Cyclops , to judge by the tremendous thumps that kept clean time to their sturdy tune . Yet it was but human labour , so heavy and so knowing , that it had called in music to help . It was the third mate and his gang completing his floor to receive the coming tea - chests . Yesterday he had stowed his dunnage , many hundred bundles of light flexible canes from Sumatra and Malacca ; on these he had laid tons of rough saltpetre , in 200 lb . gunny - bags : and was now mashing it to music , bags and all . His gang of fifteen , naked to the waist , stood in line , with huge wooden beetles called commanders , and lifted them high and brought them down on the nitre in cadence with true nautical power and unison , singing as follows , with a ponderous bump on the first note in each bar . [ music notation ] And so up to fifteen , when the stave was concluded with a shrill “
58495	59111	59363	59363	sir	1075	” and the gang relieved , streaming with perspiration . When the saltpetre was well mashed , they rolled ton water - butts on it , till the floor was like a billiard table . A fleet of chop boats then began to arrive , so many per day , with the tea - chests . Mr. Grey proceeded to lay the first tier on his saltpetre floor , and then built the chests , tier upon tier , beginning at the sides , and leaving in the middle a lane somewhat narrower than a tea - chest Then he applied a screw jack to the chests on both sides , and so enlarged his central aperture , and forced the remaining tea - chests in ; and behold the enormous cargo packed as tight as ever shopkeeper packed a box — nineteen thousand eight hundred and six chests , sixty half chests , fifty quarter chests . While Mr. Grey was contemplating his work with singular satisfaction , a small boat from Canton came alongside , and Mr. Tickell , midshipman , ran up the side , skipped on the quarterdeck , saluted it first , and then the first mate ; and gave him a line from the captain , desiring him to take the ship down to Second Bar — for her water — at the turn of the tide . Two hours after receipt of this order the ship swung to the ebb . Instantly Mr. Sharpe unmoored , and the Agra began her famous voyage , with her head at right angles to her course ; for the wind being foul , all Sharpe could do was to set his topsails , driver , and jib , and keep her in the tide way , and clear of the numerous craft , by backing or filling as the case required ; which he did with considerable dexterity , making the sails steer the helm for the nonce : he crossed the Bar at sunset , and brought to with the best bower anchor in five fathoms and a half . Here they began to take in their water , and on the fifth day the six - oared gig was ordered up to Canton for the captain . The next afternoon he passed the ship in her , going down the river to Lin - Tin , to board the Chinese admiral for his chop , or permission to leave China . All night the Agra showed three lights at her mizen peak for him , and kept a sharp look out . But he did not come : he was having a very serious talk with the Chinese admiral ; at daybreak , however , the gig was reported in sight : Sharpe told one of the midshipmen to call the boatswain and man the side . Soon the gig ran alongside ; two of the ship 's boys jumped like monkeys over the bulwarks , lighting , one on the main channels , the other on the midship port , and put the side ropes assiduously in the captain 's hands ; he bestowed a slight paternal smile on them , the first the imps had ever received from an officer , and went lightly up the sides . The moment his foot touched the deck , the boatswain gave a frightful shrill whistle ; the men at the sides uncovered ; the captain saluted the quarter - deck , and all the officers saluted him , which he returned , and stepping for a moment to the weather side of his deck , gave the loud command , “
59117	59153	59363	59363	sir	1075	” He then directed Mr. Sharpe to get what sail he could on the ship , the wind being now westerly , and dived into his cabin . The boatswain piped three shrill pipes , and “
59159	59170	59363	59363	sir	1075	” was thrice repeated forward , followed by private admonitions , “
59175	59176	59363	59363	sir	1075	” “
59181	59203	59363	59363	sir	1075	” & c. , and up tumbled the crew with homeward bound written on their tanned faces . ( Pipe . ) “
59208	59251	59363	59363	sir	1075	” In ten minutes the ninety and odd hammocks were all stowed neatly in the netting , and covered with a snowy hammock - cloth ; and the hands were active , unbitting the cable , shipping the capstan bars , & c. “
59258	59263	59256	59256	sir	1075	” cried a voice . “
59268	59278	59282	59282	fifer	2286	” returned Mr. Sharpe from the quarter - deck . “
59287	59358	59284	59284	Heave	2287	” Out broke the merry fife , with a rhythmical tune , and tramp , tramp , tramp went a hundred and twenty feet round and round , and , with brawny chests pressed tight against the capstan bars , sixty fine fellows walked the ship up to her anchor , drowning the fife at intervals with their sturdy song , as pat to their feet as an echo : — “
59365	59372	59363	59363	sir	1075	” roars the boatswain from forward . “
59386	59452	59458	59461	man the taupsle halliards	2289	” The ship being now over her anchor , and the top - sails set , the capstan bars were shipped again , the men all heaved with a will , the messenger grinned , the anchor was torn out of China with a mighty heave , and then ran up with a luff tackle and secured ; the ship 's head cast to port . “
59468	59912	59458	59461	man the taupsle halliards	2289	” Round she came slow and majestically ; the sails filled , and the good ship bore away for England . She made the Bogue forts in three or four tacks , and there she had to come to again for another chop , China being a place as hard to get into as Heaven , and to get out of as — Chancery . At three P.M. she was at Macao , and hove to four miles from the land to take in her passengers . A gun was fired from the forecastle . No boats came off . Sharpe began to fret ; for the wind , though light , had now got to the N.W. , and they were wasting it . After a while the captain came on deck , and ordered all the carronades to be scaled . The eight heavy reports bellowed the great ship 's impatience across the water and out pulled two boats with the passengers . While they were coming , Dodd sent and ordered the gunner to load the carronades with shot , and secure and apron them . The first boat brought Colonel Kenealy , Mr. Fullalove , and a prodigious negro , who all mounted by the side - ropes . But the whip was rigged for the next boat , and the Honourable Mrs. Beresford and poodle hoisted on board , item her white maid , item her black nurse , item her little boy and male Oriental in charge thereof , the strangest compound of dignity and servility , and of black and white , being clad in snowy cotton and japanned to the nine . Mrs. Beresford was the wife of a member of council in India . She had been to Macao for her boy 's health , intending to return to Calcutta : but meantime her husband was made a director , and went home : so she was going to join him . A tall , handsome lady , with too curved a nose . Like most aquiline women , she was born to domineer a bit ; and , for the last ten years , Orientals clinging at her knee and Europeans flattering at her ear had nursed this quality high and spoiled her with all their might . A similar process had been applied to her boy Frederick from infancy ; he was now nearly six . Arrogance and caprice shone so in both their sallow faces , and spoke so in every gesture , that as they came on board , Sharpe , a reader of passengers , whispered the second mate : “
59921	59922	59913	59913	Bayliss	471	” “
59930	60366	59913	59913	Bayliss	471	” grunted Mr. Bayliss . Mr. Fullalove was a Methodist parson — to the naked eye : grave , sober , lean , lank - haired . But some men are hidden fires . Fullalove was one of the extraordinary products of an extraordinary nation , the United States of America . He was an engineer for one thing , and an inventive and practical mechanician ; held two patents of his own creating , which yielded him a good income both at home and in Great Britain . Such results are seldom achieved without deep study and seclusion ; and , accordingly , Joshua Fullalove , when the inventive fit was on , would be buried deep as Archimedes for a twelvemonth , burning the midnight oil : then , his active element predominating , the pale student would dash into the forest or the prairie , with a rifle and an Indian , and come out bronzed , and more or less be - panthered or be - buffaloed ; thence invariably to sea for a year or two . There , Anglo - Saxon to the backbone , his romance had ever an eye to business ; he was always after foreign mechanical inventions — he was now importing a excellent one from Japan — and ready to do lucrative feats of knowledge : thus he bought a Turkish ship at the bottom of the Dardanelles for twelve hundred dollars , raised her cargo ( hardware ) , and sold it for six thousand dollars ; then weighed the empty ship , pumped her , repaired he ; and navigated her himself into Boston harbour , Massachusetts . On the way he rescued , with his late drowned ship , a Swedish vessel , and received salvage . He once fished eighty elephants ' tusks out of a craft foundered in the Firth of Forth , to the disgust of elder Anglo - Saxons looking on from the shore . These unusual pursuits were varied by a singular recreation : he played at elevating the African character to European levels . With this view he had bought Vespasian for eighteen hundred dollars ; whereof anon . America is fertile in mixtures : what do we not owe her ? Sherry cobbler , gin sling , cocktail , mint julep , brandy smash , sudden death , eye openers . Well , one day she outdid herself , and mixed Fullalove : Quaker , Nimrod , Archimedes , Philanthropist , decorous Red Rover , and What Not . The passenger boats cast loose . “
60372	60708	60367	60368	All hands	2293	” The boatswain piped , the light - heeled topsmen sped up the ratlines and lay out the yards , while all on deck looked up as usual to see them work . Out bellied sail after sail aloft ; the ship came curtseying round to the southward , spread her snowy pinions high and wide , and went like a bird over the wrinkled sea — homeward bound . It was an exhilarating start , and all faces were bright — but one . The captain looked somewhat grave and thoughtful , and often scanned the horizon with his glass ; he gave polite but very short answers to his friend Colonel Kenealy , who was firing nothings in his ear , and sent for the gunner . While that personage , a crusty old Niler called Monk , is cleaning himself to go on the quarter - deck , peep we into captain Dodd 's troubled mind , and into the circumstances which connect him with the heart of this story , despite the twelve thousand miles of water between him and the lovers at Barkington . It had always been his pride to lay by money for his wife and children , and , under advice of an Indian friend , he had , during the last few years , placed considerable sums , at intervals , in a great Calcutta house , which gave eight per cent for deposits : swelled by fresh capital and such high interest , the hoard grew fast . When his old ship , sore battered off the Cape , was condemned by the company 's agents at Canton , he sailed to Calcutta , intending to return thence to England as a passenger . But while he was at Calcutta , the greatest firm there suspended payment carrying astonishment and dismay into a hundred families . At such moments the press and the fireside ring for a little while with the common - sense cry , “
60715	60913	60918	60919	Captain Dodd	425	” As for Dodd , who till then had revered all these great houses with nautical or childlike confidence , a blind terror took the place of blind trust in him ; he felt guilty towards his children for risking their money ( he had got to believe it was theirs , not his ) , and vowed , if he could only get hold of it once more , he would never trust a penny of it out of his own hands again , except , perhaps , to the Bank of England . But should he ever get it ? It was a large sum . He went to Messrs. Anderson & Anderson , and drew for his fourteen thousand pounds . To his dismay , but hardly to his surprise , the clerks looked at one another , and sent the cheque into some inner department . Dodd was kept waiting . His heart sank with him : there was a hitch . Meantime came a Government officer , and paid in an enormous sum in notes and mercantile bills , principally the latter . Presently Dodd was invited into the manager 's room . “
60921	60922	60925	60925	sir	1075	” “
60927	60928	60925	60925	sir	1075	” “
60944	60945	60929	60929	You	1075	” “
60954	60958	60952	60952	sir	1075	” faltered Dodd . “
60998	61614	61615	61616	Mr. Monk	478	” They gave him his money . The bills were all manifestly good . But he recognised one of them as having just been paid in by the civilian . He found himself somehow safe in the street clutching the cash , with one half of his great paternal heart on fire , and the other half freezing . He had rescued his children 's fortune , but he had seen destruction graze it . The natural chill at being scraped by peril soon passed , the triumphant glow remained . The next sentiment was precaution : he filled with it to the brim ; he went and bought a great broad pocket - book with a key to it ; though he was on dry land . He covered it with oiled silk against the water ; and sewed the whole thing to his flannel waistcoat , and felt for it with his hand a hundred times a day : the fruit of his own toil , his children 's hoard , the rescued treasure he was to have the joy of bringing home safe to the dear partner of all his joys . Unexpectedly he was ordered out to Canton to sail the Agra to the Cape . Then a novel and strange feeling came over him like a cloud ; that feeling was , a sense of personal danger : not that the many perils of the deep were new to him : he had faced them this five - and - twenty years : but till now they were little present to his imagination : they used to come , be encountered , be gone : but now , though absent , they darkened the way . It was the pocket - book . The material treasure , the hard cash , which had lately set him in a glow , seemed now to load his chest and hang heavy round the neck of his heart . Sailors are more or less superstitious , and men are creatures of habit , even in their courage . Now David had never gone to sea with a lot of money on him before . As he was a stout - hearted man , these vague forebodings would , perhaps , have cleared away with the bustle , when the Agra set her studding sails off Macao , but for a piece of positive intelligence he had picked up at Lin - Tin . The Chinese admiral had warned him of a pirate , a daring pirate , who had been lately cruising in these waters : first heard of south the line , but had since taken a Russian ship at the very mouth of the Canton river , murdered the crew in sight of land , and sold the women for slaves , or worse . Dodd asked for particulars : was he a Ladroner , a Malay , a Bornese ? In what latitude was he to be looked for ? The admiral on this examined his memoranda : by these it appeared little was known as yet about the miscreant , except that he never cruised long on one ground ; the crew was a mixed one : the captain was believed to be a Portuguese , and to have a consort commanded by his brother : but this was doubtful ; at all events , the pair had never been seen at work together . The gunner arrived and saluted the quarter - deck ; the captain on this saluted him , and beckoned him to the weather side . On this the other officers kept religiously to leeward . “
61618	61622	61615	61616	Mr. Monk	478	” said Dodd , “
61634	61635	61623	61623	you	478	” “
61642	61654	61623	61623	you	478	” said the old Niler , with a gleam of satisfaction . “
61665	61685	61686	61686	My	0	” This simple question stirred up in one moment all the bile in the poor old gentleman 's nature . “
61768	61780	61782	61782	Dodd	278	“ Be so good as not to swear , Mr. Monk , ”
61784	61803	61782	61782	Dodd	278	“ At your age sir , I look to you to set an example to the petty officers . ”
61804	61823	61824	61824	He	278	“ Well , I wo n't swear no more , sir , d — d if I do ! ”
61837	61851	61824	61824	He	278	“ And I ax your pardon , captain , and the deck 's . ”
61938	61976	61927	61927	himself	278	“ The Daughter of light , in whose beams I , Ramgolam , bask , glows with an amicable desire to see the lord commander of the ship resembling a mountain ; and to make a communication . ”
62099	62117	62094	62094	his	278	“ Why , madam , it is shoal water off Macao ; we dare not come in . ”
62118	62152	62094	62094	his	278	“ No evasion , sir . What have I to do with your shoal water ? It was laziness , and want of consideration for a lady who has rented half your ship . ”
62153	62165	62094	62094	his	278	“ Nothing of the kind , madam , I assure you . ”
62166	62176	62094	62094	his	278	“ Are you the person they call Gentleman Dodd ? ”
62177	62180	62094	62094	his	278	“ Yes . ”
62181	62200	62201	62201	Dodd	253	“ Then do n't contradict a lady , or I shall take the liberty to dispute your title . ”
62268	62278	62280	62280	he	2319	“ I am neglecting my duties to no purpose , ”
62821	62835	62837	62837	he	2319	“ If there is a thing I can dew , it 's fiddle , ”
62977	63000	62966	62966	he	465	“ as a navigator , a mathematician , a seaman , a gentleman , and a brick , with three times three . ”
63138	63146	63100	63102	a jolly foretopman	2374	“ Yes , my man . Smoked ! ”
63147	63166	63173	63173	Dodd	253	“ Like — — and blazes , your honour , axing your pardon , and the deck 's . ”
63167	63171	63173	63173	Dodd	253	“ Young gentleman , ”
63181	63192	63173	63173	Dodd	253	“ be so good as to send the cook aft . ”
63275	63328	63256	63257	Mr. Grey	464	“ Quartermaster , unsling a fire - bucket and fill it from the men 's kids : Mr. Tickell , see the cook swallow his own mess . Bosen 's mate , take a bight of the flying jib sheet stand over him , and start him if he dailies with it . ”
63349	63422	63337	63338	the cook	9553	“ Well , ye lubbers , it is first — rate . There 's no burn in it . It goes down like oil . Curse your ladylike stomachs ; you ai n't fit for a ship ; why do n't ye go ashore and man a gingerbread coach and feed off French frogs and Italian baccy - pipe stems ? ( Whack . ) What the — — is that for ? ”
63427	63435	63337	63338	the cook	9553	“ Sup more , and jaw less . ”
63436	63542	63575	63575	Pipe	490	“ Well , I am supping as fast as I can . ( Whack , whack . ) Bloody end to ye , what are ye about ? ( Whack , whack , whack . ) Oh , Joe , Lord bless you , I ca n't eat any more of it . ( Whack . ) I 'll give you my grog for a week only to let me fling the — — stuff over the side . ( Whack , whack , whack . ) Oh , good , kind , dear Mr. Tickell , do go down to the captain for me . ”
63549	63552	63554	63555	the captain	1690	“ Avast ! ”
63566	63573	63575	63575	Pipe	490	“ Silence , fore and aft ! ”
63578	63647	63575	63575	Pipe	490	“ The cook has received a light punishment this time , for spoiling the men 's mess . My crew shall eat nothing I ca n't eat myself . My care is heavier than theirs is ; but not my work , nor my danger in time of danger . Mind that , or you 'll find I can be as severe as any master afloat . Purser . ”
63648	63651	63337	63338	the cook	9553	“ Sir . ”
63652	63667	63575	63575	Pipe	490	“ Double the men 's grog : they have been cheated of their meal . ”
63668	63675	63575	63575	Pipe	490	“ Ay , ay , sir . ”
63676	63690	63337	63338	the cook	9553	“ And stop the cook 's and his mate 's for a week . ”

64965	64972	64954	64954	He	425	“ Which way is she standing ? ”
64973	64987	64988	64988	Dodd	425	“ Ca n't say , sir . Ca n't see her move any . ”

65412	65419	65408	65408	Bayliss	471	“ how can you see that ? ”
65444	65459	65461	65461	Sharpe	466	“ Well , sir ; see the false ports , and the white eyebrows ? ”
65464	65477	65479	65479	Dodd	425	“ I see this is the best glass I ever looked through , ”

The Dutch tulip frenzy went on a petty fancy : the Railway fury goes on a great fact . Our predecessors blew mere soap bubbles ; we blow an iron bubble : but here the distinction ends . In 1825 the country undertook immediate engagements , to fulfil which a century 's income would not have sufficed : today a thousand railway companies are registered , requiring a capital of six hundred million and another thousand projected , to cost another five hundred million . Where is the money to come from ? If the world was both cultivated and civilised ( instead of neither ) , and this nation could be sold , with every building , ship , quadruped , jewel , and marketable female in it , it would not fetch the money to make these railways ; yet the country undertakes to create them in three years with its floating capital .

78238	78359	78235	78236	the surgeon	2896	“ Yes , yes , for two if you like . Oh , do n't die , Dodd , my poor old fellow . How shall I ever face his wife — I remember her , the loveliest girl you ever saw — with such a tale as this ? She will think it a cruel thing I should come out of it without a scratch , and a ten times better man to be dead : and so it is ; it is cruel , it is unjust , it is monstrous ; him to be lying there , and we muffs to be sitting croaking over him and watching for his last breath like three cursed old ravens . ”

Yet all these were results to be obtained by the right crosses , as surely as a swift horse or a circular sow . Now fancy breeding shorthorns when you might breed long heads . ”

81784	81815	81771	81771	He	537	“ I 'm bound to cross the obsequious cuss with the catawamptiousest gal in Guinea , and one that never saw a blacking bottle , not even in a dream . ”
81929	81943	81921	81921	Kenealy	467	“ Barometer going down ; moon at the full ; and Jonah aboard , ”
81966	82186	81951	81951	Kenealy	467	“ See how red the sunset is . Dodd looked , and shook his head . The sun was red , but the wrong red : an angry red : and , as he dipped into the wave , discharged a lurid coppery hue that rushed in a moment like an embodied menace over the entire heavens . The wind ceased altogether : and in the middle of an unnatural and suspicious calm the glass went down , down , down . The moon rose , and instantly all eyes were bent on her with suspicion ; for in this latitude the hurricanes generally come at the full moon . She was tolerably clear , however ; but a light scud sailing across her disc showed there was wind in the upper regions . Dodd trusted to science ; barred the lee - ports , and had the dead lights put into the stem cabin and secured : then turned in for an hour 's sleep . Science proved a prophet . Just at seven bells , in one moment like a thunderbolt from the sky , a heavy squall struck the ship . Under a less careful captain her lee - ports would have been open , and she might have gone to the bottom like a bullet . “
82193	82238	81951	81951	Kenealy	467	” roared Sharpe hastily to a hand he had placed there on purpose . He let go , and there was the sail flapping like thunder , and the sheet lashing everything in the most dangerous way . Dodd was on deck in a moment “
82247	82252	81951	81951	Kenealy	467	” ( Pipe . ) “
82260	82476	82477	82477	We	3114	” Up tumbled the crew , went cheerily to work , and by three bells in the middle watch had hauled up what was left of the shivered mainsail , and hove the ship to under close - reefed main topsail and storm stay - sails ; and so the voyage was suspended . A heavy sea got up under a scourging wind , that rose and rose , till the Agra , under the pressure of that single sail treble reefed , heeled over so as to dip her lee channels . This went on till the waves rolled so high , and the squalls were so bitter , that sheets of water were actually torn off their crests and launched incessantly on deck , not only drenching Dodd and his officers , which they did not mind , but threatening to flood the ship . Dodd battened down the hatches and stopped that game . Then came a danger no skill could avert : the ship lurched so violently now , as not merely to clip , but bury , her lower deck port - pendents : and so a good deal of water found ingress through the windage . Then Dodd set a gang to the pumps : for , he said , “
82501	82610	82611	82611	She	3116	” And now the wind , raging and roaring like discharges of artillery , and not like wind as known in our seas , seemed to have put out all the lights of heaven . The sky was inky black , and quite close to their heads : and the wind still increasing , the vessel came down to her extreme bearings , and it was plain she would soon be on her beam ends . Sharpe and Dodd met , and holding on by the life - lines , applied their speaking trumpets tight to each other 's ears ; and even then they had to bawl . “
82620	82621	82611	82611	She	3116	” “
82631	82632	82611	82611	She	3116	” “
82640	82646	82611	82611	She	3116	” Sharpe shook his head . “
82665	82666	82667	82667	You	1075	” “
82680	82681	82682	82682	Volunteers	541	” “
82686	82687	82684	82684	sir	1075	” “
82701	82812	82813	82814	Mr. Grey	464	” Sharpe 's difficulty was to keep the men back , so eager were the fine fellows to risk their lives . However , he brought twelve to the cabin , headed by Mr. Grey , who had a right , as captain of the watch , to go with them ; on which right he insisted , in spite of Dodd 's earnest request that he would forego it . When Dodd saw his resolution , he dropped the friend and resumed the captain ; and spoke to them through a trumpet ; the first time he had ever used one in a cabin , or seen one used . “
82830	82831	82813	82814	Mr. Grey	464	” “
82838	82839	82813	82814	Mr. Grey	464	” “
82847	82848	82849	82849	Hurrah	542	” “
82851	82852	82849	82849	Hurrah	542	” “
82952	84388	84389	84389	Agra	462	” Mr. Grey and his twelve men left the cabin : and hey ! for the main top . The men let the officer lead them as far as Jacob 's ladder , and then hurrah for the lee yard - arm ! That was where all wanted to be , and but one could be . Grey was as anxious as the rest ; but officers of his rank seldom go aloft , and soon fall out of their catlike habits . He had done about six ratlines , when , instead of going hand over head , he spread his arms to seize a shroud on each side of him : by this he weakened his leverage , and the wind just then came fiercer , caught him , and flattened him against the rigging as tight as if Nature had caught up a mountain for a hammer and nailed him with a cedar ; he was spread - eagled . The men accepted him at once as a new patent ratline with a fine resisting power : they went up him , and bounded three ordinary ratlines at a go off all his promontories , especially his shoulders and his head , receiving his compliments in the shape of hearty curses . They gained the top and lay out on the yard with their hair flying like streamers : and who got the place of honour but Thompson , the jolly fore - topman who could n't stand smoked pea - soup . So strong and so weak are men . Thompson raised his knife high ; there was a pause : then in went all their knives , and away went the sail into the night of the storm , and soon seemed a sheet of writing - paper , and more likely to hit the sky than the sea . The men came down , picked their officer off the rigging , had a dram in the captain 's cabin , and saw him enter their names in the log - book for good service , and in the purser 's for extra grog on Sundays from there to Gravesend . The ship was relieved ; and all looked well till the chronometer , their only guide now , announced sunset : when the wind , incredible as it may appear , increased , and one frightful squall dipped the muzzles of the lee carronades in the water . Then was heard the first cry of distress : an appalling sound ; the wail of brave men . And they had borne it all so bravely , so cheerfully , till now . But now they knew something must go , or else the ship ; the suspense was awful , but very short . Crack ! crash ! the fore and main topmast both gone short off by the caps ; and the ship recovered slowly , hesitatingly , tremblingly . Relieving her from one danger , this subjected her to another and a terrible one . The heavy spars that had fallen , unable to break loose from the rigging , pounded the ship so savagely as to threaten to stave in her side . Add to this that , with labouring so long and severely , some of the ship 's seams began now to open and shut and discharge the oakum , which is terrible to the bravest seamen . Yet neither this stout captain nor his crew shirked any danger men had ever grappled with since men were . Dodd ordered them to cut away the wreck to leeward ; it was done : then to windward ; this , the more ticklish operation , was also done smartly : the wreck passed under the ship 's quarter , and she drifted clear of it They breathed again . At eight bells in the first watch it began to thunder and lighten furiously ; but the thunder , though close , was quite inaudible in the tremendous uproar of the wind and sea . It blew a hurricane : there were no more squalls now ; but one continuous tornado , which in its passage through that great gaunt skeleton , the ship 's rigging and bare poles , howled and yelled and roared so terrifically , as would have silenced a salvo of artillery fired alongside . The overwhelming sea ran in dark watery mountains crested with devilish fire . The inky blackness added supernatural horror ; the wrath of the Almighty seemed upon them ; and His hand to drop the black sky down on them for their funeral pall . Surely Noah from his ark saw nothing more terrible . What is that ? Close on the lee bow : chose : the flash of a gun , another ; another ; another . A ship in distress firing minute - guns in their ears ; yet no sound : human thunder silenced , as God 's thunder was silenced , by the uproar of His greater creatures in their mad rage . The Agra fired two minute - guns to let the other poor ship know she had a companion in her helplessness and her distress , and probably a companion in her fate . Even this companionship added its mite of danger : for both ships were mere playthings of the elements ; they might be tossed together ; and then , what would be their fate ? Two eggs clashed together in a great boiling caldron , and all the life spilt out . Yet did each flash shoot a ray of humanity and sympathy into the thick black supernatural horror . And now came calamity upon calamity . A tremendous sea broke the tiller at the rudder - head , and not only was the ship in danger of falling off and shipping the sea , but the rudder hammered her awfully , and bade fair to stave in her counter , which is another word for Destruction . Thus death came at them with two hands open at once . These vessels always carry a spare tiller : they tried to ship it ; but the difficulty was prodigious . No light but the miserable deck - lantern — one glowworm in Egypt supernaturally darkened — the Agra never on an even keel , and heeling over like a seesaw more than a ship ; and then every time they did place the tiller , and get the strain on with their luff tackles , the awful sea gave it a blow and knocked it away like a hair . At last they hit it off , or thought they had , for the ponderous thumps of the rudder ceased entirely . However , the ship did not obey this new tiller like the old one : her head fell off in an unlucky moment when seven waves were rolling in one , and , on coming to the windward again , she shipped a sea . It came in over her bow transversely ; broke as high as the mainstay , and hid and buried the whole ship before the mast ; carried away the waist bulwarks on both sides , filled the launch , and drowned the live stock which were in it ; swept four water - butts and three men away into the sea , like corks and straws ; and sent tons of water down the forescuttle and main hatchway , which was partly opened , not to stifle the crew , and flooded the gun - deck ankle - deep . Dodd , who was in his cabin , sent the whole crew to the pumps , except the men at the wheel , and prepared for the worst . In men so brave as he was , when Hope dies Fear dies . His chief care now was to separate the fate of those he loved from his own . He took a bottle , inserted the fatal money in it with a few words of love to his wife , and of direction to any stranger that should fall in with it ; secured the cork with melted sealing - wax , tied oilskin over it and melted wax on that ; applied a preparation to the glass to close the pores ; and to protect it against other accidents , and attract attention , fastened a black painted bladder to it by a stout tarred twine , and painted “
84395	84448	84389	84389	Agra	462	” in white on the bladder . He had logged each main incident of the storm with that curt business - like accuracy which reads so cold and small a record of these great and terrible tragedies . He now made a final entry a little more in character with the situation : “
84527	85652	85653	85653	I	0	” He got on deck with the bottle in his pocket and the bladder peeping out : put the log and its case down on deck , and by means of the life - lines crawled along on his knees , and with great difficulty , to the wheel . Finding the men could hardly hold on , and dreading another sea , Dodd , with his own hands , lashed them to the helm . While thus employed , he felt the ship give a slight roll , a very slight roll to windward . His experienced eye lightened with hope , he cast his eager glance to leeward . There it is a sailor looks for the first spark of hope . Ay , thereaway was a little gleam of light . He patted the helmsman on the shoulder and pointed to it ; for now neither could one man speak for the wind , nor another hear . The sailor nodded joyfully . Presently the continuous tornado broke into squalls . Hope grew brighter . But , unfortunately , in one furious squall the ship broke round off , so as to present her quarter to the sea at an unlucky moment : for it came seven deep again , a roaring mountain , and hurled itself over her stern and quarter . The mighty mass struck her stem frame with the weight of a hundred thousand tons of water , and drove her forward as a boy launches his toy - boat on a pond ; and though she made so little resistance , stove in the dead lights and the port frames , burst through the cabin bulkheads , and washed out all the furniture , and Colonel Kenealy in his nightgown with a table in his arms borne on water three feet deep , and carried him under the poop awning away to the lee quarter - deck scuppers , and flooded the lower deck . Above , it swept the quarter - deck clean of everything except the shrieking helmsmen ; washed Dodd away like a cork , and would have carried him overboard if he had not brought up against the mainmast and grasped it like grim death , half drowned , half stunned , sorely bruised , and gasping like a porpoise ashore . He held on by the mast in water and foam , panting . He rolled his despairing eyes around ; the bulwarks fore and aft were all in ruins , with wide chasms , as between the battlements of some decayed castle ; and through the gaps he saw the sea yawning wide for him . He dare not move : no man was safe a moment unless lashed to mast or helm . He held on , expecting death . But presently it struck him he could see much farther than before . He looked up : it was clearing overhead , and the uproar abating visibly . And now the wind did not decline as after a gale : extraordinary to the last , it blew itself out . Sharpe came on deck , and crawled on all fours to his captain , and helped him to a life - line . He held on by it , and gave his orders . The wind was blown out , but the sea was as dangerous as ever . The ship began to roll to windward . If that was not stopped , her fate was sealed . Dodd had the main trysail set and then the fore trysail , before he would yield to go below , though drenched , and sore , and hungry , and worn out . Those sails steadied the ship ; the sea began to go down by degrees ; the celestial part of nature was more generous : away flew every cloud , out came the heavenly sky bluer and lovelier than ever they had seen it ; the sun flamed in its centre . Nature , after three days ' eclipse , was so lovely , it seemed a new heavens and a new earth . If there was an infidel on board who did not believe in God , now his soul felt Him , in spite of the poor little head . As for Dodd , who was naturally pious , he raised his eyes towards that lovely sky in heartfelt , though silent , gratitude to its Maker for saving the ship and cargo and her people 's lives , not forgetting the private treasure he was carrying home to his dear wife and children . With this thought , he naturally looked down , but missed the bladder that had lately protruded from his pocket He clapped his hand to his pocket all in a flutter . The bottle was gone . In a fever of alarm and anxiety , but with good hopes of finding it , he searched the deck ; he looked in every cranny , behind every coil of rope the sea had not carried away . In vain . The sea , acting on the buoyant bladder attached , had clearly torn the bottle out of his pocket , when it washed him against the mast . His treasure then must have been driven much farther ; and how far ? Who could tell ? It flashed on the poor man with fearful distinctness that it must either have been picked up by somebody in the ship ere now , or else carried out to sea . Strict inquiry was made amongst the men . No one had seen it The fruit of his toil and prudence , the treasure Love , not Avarice , had twined with his heartstrings , was gone . In its defence he had defeated two pirates , each his superior in force ; and now conquered the elements at their maddest . And in the very moment of that great victory — It was gone . IN the narrative of home events I skipped a little business , not quite colourless , but irrelevant to the love passages then on hand . It has , however , a connection with the curious events now converging to a point : so , with the reader 's permission , I will place it in logical sequence , disregarding the order of time . The day Dr. Sampson splashed among the ducks , and one of them hid till dinner , the rest were seated at luncheon , when two patients were announced as waiting — Mr. and Mrs. Maxley . Sampson refused to see them , on this ground : “
85660	85670	85653	85653	I	0	” But Mrs. Dodd interceded , and he yielded . “
85687	85711	85680	85680	They	3134	” On this , a stout fresh - coloured woman , the picture of health , was ushered in and curtseyed all round . “
85720	85726	85730	85731	Mrs. Maxley	324	” inquired Sampson rather roughly . “

86436	86461	86139	86139	his	357	“ Dear heart , how cantankerous you be . To be sure Dr. Osmond he says no : it 's muscular , says he . ”
86462	86491	86139	86139	his	357	“ Dr. Osmond 's an ijjit . List me ; You must n't grizzle about money ; you must n't gobble , nor drink your beer too fast . ”
86492	86509	86137	86137	Sampson	357	“ You are wrong , doctor ; I never drink no beer : it costs — — ”
86510	86612	86139	86139	his	357	“ Your catlap , then . And above all , no grizzling ! Go to church whenever you can without losing a farthing . It 's medicinal ; soothes the brain , and takes it off worldly cares . And have no words with your husband , or he 'll outlive you ; it 's his only chance of getting the last word . Care killed a cat , a nanimal with eight lives more than a chatterbox . If you worry or excite your brain , little Maxley , you will cook your own goose — by a quick fire . ”
86613	86635	86139	86139	his	357	“ Dear heart , these be unked sayings . Wo n't ye give me nothing to make me better , sir ? ”
86636	86685	86139	86139	his	357	“ No , I never tinker ; I go to the root : you may buy a vile of chlorofm and take a puff if you feel premonory symps : but a quiet brain is your only real chance . Now slope , and send the male screw . ”
86686	86689	86139	86139	his	357	“ Anan ? ”
86690	86694	86139	86139	his	357	“ Your husband . ”
86695	86718	86139	86139	his	357	“ That I will , sir . Your sarvant , doctor ; your sarvant , ma'am ; sarvant , all the company . ”
86732	86741	86743	86743	Sampson	357	“ Oh , it is a mortal disease , ”
86751	86775	86743	86743	Sampson	357	“ She has got angina pictoris or brist - pang , a disorder that admirably eximplifies the pretinsions of midicine t ' seeince . ”
86919	86930	86891	86891	he	357	“ Well , what is it Maxley ! Rheumatism again ? ”
86931	86939	86941	86941	Maxley	324	“ No , that it ai n't , ”
86944	86953	86941	86941	Maxley	324	“ What then ? Come , look sharp . ”
86954	86977	86891	86891	he	357	“ Well , then , doctor , I 'll tell you . I 'm sore troubled — with — a — mouse . ”
87012	87016	87018	87018	Sampson	357	“ A mouse ! ”
87021	87057	87058	87058	Maxley	324	“ Where ? Up your sleeve ? Do n't come to me : go t ' a sawbones and have your arm cut off . I 've seen 'em mutilate a pashint for as little . ”
87077	87102	87072	87072	Alfred	312	“ Might it not have gone down his throat ? Took his potato - trap for the pantry - door . Ha ! ha ! ”
87103	87121	87123	87123	Maxley	324	“ Ay , I hear ye , young man , a - laughing at your own sport , ”
87129	87169	87123	87123	Maxley	324	“ but ' tain't the biggest mouth as catches the most . You sits yander fit to bust ; but ( with a roar like a lion ) ye never offers me none on't , neither sup nor bit . ”
87213	87222	87224	87224	Maxley	324	“ You 're a gentleman , you are , ”
87255	87258	87260	87260	he	357	“ Well , ”
87268	87290	87260	87260	he	357	“ you gentlefoiks wo n't die of hard work ; your sarvants must cut the very meat to fit your mouths . ”
87336	87350	87331	87331	Maxley	324	“ Monsieur avait bien raison ; le souris a passe : par la . ”
87385	87406	87407	87407	Sampson	357	“ And I be come here to put an end to her , if I 've any luck at all . ”
87415	87429	87407	87407	Sampson	357	“ Nature has put an end to her as long as her body . ”
87526	87558	87514	87514	He	357	“ White arsenic she wo n't look at for I 've tried her ; but they tell me there 's another sweetmeat come up , which they call it striek nine . ”
87559	87576	87495	87495	he	357	“ Hets ! let the poor beasty alone . Life 's as sweet tit as tus . ”
87577	87596	87598	87598	Maxley	381	“ If you was a gardener , you 'd feel for the bulbs , not for the varmin , ”
87602	87633	87598	87598	Maxley	381	“ But bein ' a man of sceince , I feel for th ' higher organisation . Mice are a part of Nature , as much as market - gardeners . ”
87634	87645	87646	87646	Sampson	357	“ So be stoats , and adders , and doctors . ”
87649	87678	87646	87646	Sampson	357	“ Jintlemen , here 's a pretty pashint : reflects on our lairned profission , and it never cost him a guinea , for the dog never pays . ”
87679	87713	87598	87598	Maxley	381	“ Do n't let my chaff choke ye , doctor . That warn't meant for you altogether . So if you have got a little bit of that ' ere about you — — ”
87714	87787	87598	87598	Maxley	381	“ I 'm not a ratcatcher , my man : I do n't go with dith in my pocket , like the surgeons that carry a lancet . And if I had Murder in both pockets , you should n't get any . Here 's a greedy dog ! got a thousand pounds in the bank , and grudges his healer a guinea , and his mouse a stand - up bite . ”
87788	87799	87801	87801	Maxley	381	“ Now , who have been a telling you lies ? ”
87804	87840	87842	87842	he	381	“ My missus , for a farthing . I 'm not a thousand - pound man ; I 'm a nine - hundred - pound man ; and it 's all safe at Hardie 's . ”
87851	88085	87842	87842	he	381	“ I do n't hold with Lunnon banks ; they be like my missus 's eggs : all one outside , and the rotten ones only known by breaking . Well ( loud ) I be pretty close , I do n't deny it ; but ( confidentially ) my missus beats me . I look twice at a penny ; but she looks twice at both sides of a halfpenny before she will let him go : and it 's her being so close have raised all this here bobbery ; and so I told her ; says I , ' Missus , if you would but leave an end of a dip , or a paring of cheese , about your cupboard , she would hide at home ; but you hungers her so , you drives her afield right on atop o ' my roots . ' ' Oh , ' says my missus , ' if I was to be as wasteful as you be , where should we be come Christmas day ? Every tub on its own bottom , ' says she ; ' man and wife did ought to keep theirselves to theirselves , she to the house , and I to the garden . ' ' So be it , says I , ' and by the same toaken , do n't let me catch them “
88087	88242	88252	88252	Alfred	312	” in my garden again , or I 'll spoil their clucking and scratching , ' says I , ' for I 'll twist their dalled necks : ye've got a yard , ' says I , ' and a roost , and likewise a turnpike , you and your poultry : so bide at home the lot , and do n't come a scratching o ' me , ' and with that we had a ripput ; and she took one of her pangs ; and then I behoved to knock under ; and that is allus the way if ye quarrel with woman - folk ; they are sworn to get the better of ye by hook or by crook . Now dooe give me a bit of that ere , to quiet this here , as eats me up by the roots and sets my missus and me by the ears . ”
88243	88250	88252	88252	Alfred	312	“ Justum ac tenacem propositi virum , ”
88268	88274	88276	88277	Mr. Maxley	381	“ Not afore my betters , ”
88286	88293	88252	88252	Alfred	312	“ Wo n't ye , now ? ”
88294	88307	88320	88320	Maxley	381	“ I 'll see ye hanged first , ye miserly old assassin . ”
88308	88318	88320	88320	Maxley	381	“ Then I have nothing to thank you for , ”
88347	88354	88356	88356	Edward	254	“ Quite a passage of arms , ”
88358	88361	88363	88364	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Yes , ”
88366	88404	88363	88364	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ and of bludgeons and things , rather than the polished rapier . What expressions to fall from two highly educated gentlemen ! Slope — Potato - trap — Sawbones — Catlap — je n'en finirais pas . ”

88459	88466	88468	88468	he	357	“ Now , that is odd , ”
88470	88639	88468	88468	he	357	“ Why , I am compilin ' a vocabulary myself . I call ' t th ' ass - ass - ins ' dickshinary ; showing how , by the use of mealy - mouthed and d'exotic phrases , knaves can lead fools by th ' ear a vilent dith . F'r instance ; if one was to say to John Bull , ' Now I 'll cut a great gash in your arm and let your blood run till ye drop down senseless , ' he 'd take fright and say , ' Call another time ! ' So the profissional ass - ass - in words it thus : ' I 'll bleed you from a large orifice till the occurrence of syncope . ' All right sis John : he 's bled from a lar j'orifice and dies three days after of th ' assassin 's knife hid in a sheath o ' goose grease . But I 'll bloe the gaff with my dictionary . ”

89203	89206	89208	89208	he	2596	“ Come , ”
89211	89244	89245	89245	He	2596	“ my loss has saved all these poor souls on board this ship . So be it ! Heaven 's will be done ! I must bustle , or else go mad . ”

I 'm here to restore discipline to this ship : so mind how you run athwart my hawse : do n't you play with the bull , my men ; or you 'll find his horns — — sharp . Pipe down ! Now , you , sir , bring me the log - book . ”
92778	92882	92766	92766	He	562	“ Pirates , and hurricanes ! I never fell in with pirates nor hurricanes : I have heard of a breeze , and a gale , but I never knew a seaman worth his salt say ' hurricane . ' Get another log - book , Mr. Sharpe ; put down that it begins this day at noon ; and enter that Captain Robarts came on deck , found the ship in a miserable condition , took the command , mustered the officers and men , and stopped the ship 's company 's grog for a week for receiving him with hats on . ”
92894	92910	92884	92884	Sharpe	466	“ Stop — the ship 's company's — grog — for a week , sir ? ”
92911	92966	92970	92972	the new captain	3300	“ Yes , sir , for a week ; and if you fling my orders back in my face instead of clapping on sail to execute them , I 'll have you towed ashore on a grating . Your name is Sharpe ; well my name is Dammedsharpe , and so you 'll find . ”
93150	93175	93138	93138	He	3300	“ Never you mind ! The greater Tartar he is , the less likely to sink you or run you on a lee shore . ”

93287	93303	93284	93284	he	3312	“ No , commodore . I am the first mate : the captain is ashore . ”
93304	93319	93266	93266	Sharpe	466	“ I am sorry for it . I want to talk about his rudder . ”
93320	93331	93333	93333	Sharpe	466	“ Oh , he had nothing to do with that , ”
93337	93371	93333	93333	Sharpe	466	“ that was our dear old captain : he is on board . Young gentleman ! ask Captain Dodd to oblige me by coming on deck ! Hy ! and Mr. Fullalove too . ”

93389	93405	93333	93333	Sharpe	466	“ That is a name we give the middies ; I do n't know why . ”
93406	93415	93378	93378	Collier	565	“ Nor I neither ; ha ! ha ! ”

93458	93526	93456	93456	Collier	565	“ I know you Yankees are very handy . I lost my rudder at sea once , and had to ship a makeshift ; but it was a cursed complicated thing , not a patch upon yours , Mr. Fullalove . Yours is ingenious and simple . Ship has been in action , I see : pray how was that , if I may be so bold ? ”
93527	93532	93534	93534	Sharpe	466	“ Pirates , commodore , ”
93536	93612	93534	93534	Sharpe	466	“ We fell in with a brace of Portuguese devils , lateen - rigged , and carrying ten guns apiece , in the Straits of Gaspar : fought 'em from noon till sundown , riddled one , and ran down the other , and sunk her in a moment . That was all your doing , Captain : so do n't try to shift it on other people ; for we wo n't stand it . ”
93613	93625	93627	93627	Collier	565	“ If he denies it , I wo n't believe him , ”
93629	93661	93627	93627	Collier	565	“ for he has got it in his eye . Gentlemen , will you do me the honour to dine with me to - day on board the flag - ship ? ”

95913	95943	95857	95857	he	562	“ I mean to sail her without your advice , sir ; and , being a seaman , I shall get all I can out of a fair wind . ”

96563	96583	96585	96585	Dodd	425	“ To see a first - class ship drift to leeward in a narrow sea with a fair wind , ”
96715	96764	96694	96695	The crew	8433	“ there was not one of them the captain had n't started , and stopped his grog a dozen times : he had made the ship hell to them ; and now her masts and yards and hull might go there along with her skipper , for them . ”

96876	97019	96860	96860	he	3448	“ St. Katherine 's Point lay about eight miles to windward at noon ; and we have been drifting south and east this twelve hours , through lying to on the starboard tack ; and besides , the ship has been conned as slovenly as she is sailed . I 've seen her allowed to break off a dozen times , and gather more leeway . Ah ! here is Captain Robarts . Captain , you saw the rate we passed the revenue cutter . That vessel was nearly stationary ; so what we passed her at was our own rate of drifting , and our least rate . Putting all this together , we ca n't be many miles from the French coast , and , unless we look sharp and beat to windward , I pronounce the ship in danger . ”
97026	97048	96860	96860	he	3448	“ We are nearer Yarmouth sands than France , I promise you , and nothing under our lee nearer than Rotterdam . ”
97057	97065	96860	96860	he	3448	“ A LIGHT ON THE LEE BOW ! ”
97066	97069	97071	97071	Robarts	562	“ There ! ”
97076	97089	97090	97090	He	562	“ foul of her next ! through me listening to your nonsense . ”

97210	97295	97199	97199	Robarts	562	“ That is all right : and now , Captain Dodd , a word with you . You will either retire at once to your cabin , or will cease to breed disaffection in my crew , and groundless alarm in my passengers , by instilling your own childish , ignorant fears . The ship has been underlogged a hundred miles , sir ; and but for my caution in lying to for clear weather we should be groping among the Fern Isl — — ”
97420	97429	97439	97439	Dodd	425	“ O God ! we are dead men . ”

97622	97628	97629	97629	he	562	“ Stick to the ship , ”
97632	97644	97629	97629	he	562	“ there is no danger if you stick to the ship , ”

101481	101574	101477	101478	Mrs. Beresford	469	“ The poor Agra , ma'am ! She was such a beautiful sea - boat : and just look at her now ! Never sail again : never ! never ! She was a little crank in beating , I ca n't deny it ; but how she did fly with the wind abaft . She sank a pirate in the straits , and weathered a hurricane off the Mauritius ; and after all for a lubber to go and lay her bones ashore in a fair wind : poor dear beauty ! ”

106652	106656	106658	106659	the people	3772	“ Poisoned ! ! ”
106661	106664	106666	106667	Mr. Osmond	326	“ Poisoned ! ”
106681	106692	106666	106667	Mr. Osmond	326	“ Is there any one you have reason to suspect ? ”
106693	106756	106757	106757	He	326	“ I do n't suspect , nor conject , sir : I know . The man is poisoned , the substance strychnine . Now stand out of the way you gaping gabies , and let me work . Hy , young Oxford ! you are a man : get behind and hold both his arms for your life ! That 's you ! ”
106777	106793	106795	106795	his	326	“ You may just as well squirt rose - water at a house on fire ; ”
106895	106902	106904	106904	Osmond	326	“ It is really very extraordinary , ”
106906	106927	106928	106928	He	326	“ Mai — dearr — sirr , nothing 's extraornary t ' a man that knows the reason of iverything . ”
106949	106959	106961	106961	Osmond	326	“ I am sorry to say it is continuous , ”
106963	106990	106991	106991	He	326	“ Mai — dearr — sirr , nothing on airth is continuous : iverything has paroxysms and remissions — from a toothache t ' a cancer . ”

107042	107074	107076	107076	he	326	“ If you please , ma'am , there 's half a guinea for you for not being such an ' ijjit as the rest of the world , especially the Dockers . ”
107144	107154	107156	107156	he	357	“ I 'll puzzle ye , my friend strych , ”
107158	107264	107156	107156	he	357	“ How will ye get your perriodical paroxysms when the man is insensible ? The Dox say y ' act direct on the spinal marrow . Well , there 's the spinal marrow where you found it just now . Act on it again , my lad ! I give ye leave — if ye can . Ye ca n't ; bekase ye must pass through the Brain to get there : and I occupy the Brain with a swifter ajint than y ' are , and mean to keep y ' out of it till your power to kill evaporates , being a vigitable . ”
107300	107305	107307	107307	he	357	“ Now , jintlemen , ”
107309	107508	107307	107307	he	357	“ obsairve the great Therey of the Perriodeecity and Remitteney of all disease , in conjunckshin with its practice . All diseases have paroxysms and remissions , which occur at intervals ; sometimes it 's a year , sometimes a day , an hour , ten minutes ; but whatever th ' interval , they are true to it : they keep time . Only when the disease is retirin , the remissions become longer , the paroxysms return at a greater interval , and just the revairse when the pashint is to die . This , jintlemen , is man 's life from the womb to the grave : the throes that precede his birth are remittent like ivery thing else , but come at diminished intervals when he has really made up his mind to be born ( his first mistake , sirs , but not his last ) ; and the paroxysms of his mortal disease come at shorter intervals when he is really goon off the hooks : but still chronometrically ; just as watches keep time whether they go fast or slow . Now , jintlemen , is n't this a beautiful Therey ? ”
107509	107530	107532	107533	the sufferer	1279	“ Oh , mercy ! Oh , good people help me ! Oh , Jesus Christ have pity on me ! ”

107572	107619	107570	107570	he	8653	“ smell to this , lad ! That 's right ! He is better already , jintlemen , or he could n't howl , ye know . Deevil a howl in um before I gave um puff chlorofm . Ah ! would ye ? would ye ? ”
107620	107631	107632	107633	The Doctor	8653	“ Oh ! oh ! oh ! oh ! ugh!——ah ! ”
107656	107729	107642	107642	his	8653	“ And now to th ' application of the Therey : If the poison can reduce the tin minutes ' interval to five minutes , this pashint will die ; and if I can get the tin minutes up t ' half hour , this pashint will live . Any way , jintlemen , we wo n't detain y ' unreasonably : the case shall be at an end by one o'clock . ”
107746	107772	107773	107773	Sampson	357	“ Alack ! poor James Maxley ! he is at his last hour : it be just gone twelve , and a dies at one . ”
107779	107808	107773	107773	Sampson	357	“ Who says that , y ' ijjits ? I said the case would end at one : a case ends when the pashint gets well or dies . ”
107809	107834	107835	107835	Sampson	357	“ Oh , that is good news for poor Susan Maxley ; her man is to be well by one o'clock , Doctor says . ”
107915	107923	107912	107912	Sampson	357	“ Any fool can complete the cure ; ”
107976	108016	108028	108028	himself	326	“ If he gets drunk , all the better ; a little intoxication weakens the body 's memory of the pain it has endured , and so expedites the cure . Now off we go to th ' other . ”

108030	108039	108028	108028	himself	326	“ what on earth does the quack mean ? ”
108137	108143	108145	108145	Sampson	357	“ Why , of course , ”
108153	108162	108164	108164	Alfred	312	“ Then ask me in before Mrs. Dodd , ”
108167	108172	108174	108175	the Doctor	8653	“ Oo , ay , ”
108178	108182	108174	108175	the Doctor	8653	“ I see . ”
108238	108356	108357	108357	He	357	“ There , it 's all right . Come , little Maxley , ye need n't cry ; he has got lots more mischief to do in the world yet ; but , O wumman , it is lucky you came to me and not to any of the tinkering dox . No more cat and dog for you and him but for the Chronothairmal Therey . And you may bless my puppy 's four bones too : he ran and stole a fly like a man , and drove hilter - skilter . Now , if I had got to your house two minutes later , your Jamie would have lairned the great secret ere this . ”
108363	108380	108357	108357	He	357	“ Haw you ! come away and receive the applause due from beauty t ' ajeelity . ”
108566	108572	108574	108575	Mrs. Maxley	324	“ But , dear heart ! ”
108577	108604	108574	108575	Mrs. Maxley	324	“ ye do n't tell me what he ailed . Ma'am , if you had seen him you would have said he was taken for death . ”
108605	108612	108614	108615	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Pray what is the complaint ? ”
108617	108628	108614	108615	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Oh , did n't I tell ye ? Poisoned . ”
108654	108671	108646	108647	Mrs. Maxley	324	“ Do n't ye go giving my house an ill name ! We keeps no poison . ”
108680	108702	108674	108674	his	357	“ Wumman , ye know better : ye keep strychnine , for th ' use and delectation of your domestic animal . ”
108703	108719	108574	108575	Mrs. Maxley	324	“ Strychnine ! I never heard tell of it . Is that Latin for arsenic ? ”
108720	108937	108947	108948	Mrs. Maxley	324	“ Now is n't this lamentable ? Why , arsenic is a mital ; strychnine a vigitable . N'hist me ! Your man was here seeking strychnine to poison his mouse ; a harmless , domistic , necessary mouse . I told him mice were a part of Nature as much as Maxleys , and life as sweet tit as tim : but he was dif to scientific and chrisehin preceps ; so I told him to go to the Deevil : ' I will , ' sis he , and went t ' a docker . The two assassins have poisoned the poor beastie between 'em ; and thin , been the greatest miser in the world , except one , he will have roasted his victim , and ate her on the sly , imprignated with strychnine . ' I 'll steal a march on t'other miser , ' sis he ; and that 's you : t ' his brain flew the strychnine : his brain sint it to his spinal marrow : and we found my lorrd bent like a bow , and his jaw locked , and nearer knowin the great secret than any man in England will be this year to live : and sairves the assassinating old vagabin right . ”
108938	108945	108947	108948	Mrs. Maxley	324	“ Heaven forgive you , Doctor , ”
108953	108962	108947	108948	Mrs. Maxley	324	“ For curin a murrderer ? Not likely . ”
109045	109108	109034	109034	Sampson	357	“ Nixt time he has a mind to breakfast on strychnine , you tell me ; and I 'll put a pinch of arsenic in the salt - cellar , and cure him safe as the bank . But this time he 'd have been did and stiff long before such a slow ajint as arsenic could get a hold on um . ”

109260	109265	109267	109267	he	357	“ Here 's vanity ! ”
109269	109293	109267	109267	he	357	“ Now do you really think your two lives are worth a guinea ? Why , it 's 252 pence ! 1008 farthings ! ”
109356	109364	109366	109366	he	357	“ Why , they are only fish , ”

110233	110244	110227	110227	Maxley	394	“ Then we 'll say no more about the halfpenny . ”

110627	110642	110528	110530	these shrewd rustics	3832	“ How much have you got of mine , if you please , sir ? ”
110643	110657	110528	110530	these shrewd rustics	3832	“ Your balance ? I 'll see . Nine hundred and four pounds . ”
110658	110674	110582	110583	young Skinner	430	“ Well , sir , then , if you please , I 'll draa that . ”

110716	110728	110703	110704	the other	2684	“ it is only for a day or two , sir . ”
110729	110770	110528	110530	these shrewd rustics	3832	“ Ah ! I see , going to make a purchase . By - the - bye , I believe Mr. Hardie means to offer you some grounds he is buying outside the town : will that suit your book ? ”
110771	110780	110582	110583	young Skinner	430	“ I dare say it will , sir . ”
110781	110793	110703	110704	the other	2684	“ Then perhaps you will wait till our governor comes in ? ”
110794	110800	110528	110530	these shrewd rustics	3832	“ I have no objection . ”
110801	110817	110582	110583	young Skinner	430	“ He wo n't be long . Fine weather for the gardens , Mr. Maxley . ”
110818	110854	110703	110704	the other	2684	“ Moderate , sir . I 'll take my money if you please . Counting it out , that will help pass the time till Muster Hardie comes . You han't made away with it ? ”
110855	110862	110528	110530	these shrewd rustics	3832	“ What d'ye mean , sir ? ”
110863	110872	110582	110583	young Skinner	430	“ Hardies bain't turned thieves , be they ? ”
110873	110883	110528	110530	these shrewd rustics	3832	“ Are you mad or intoxicated , Mr. Maxley ? ”
110921	110922	110923	110923	Henry	584	” “
110934	110977	110923	110923	Henry	584	” said Skinner with cool dignity . But when he had said this , he was at his wits ' end : there were not nine hundred pounds of hard cash in the bank , nor anything like it . SKINNER — called “
110979	111497	110923	110923	Henry	584	” because he had once had a father on the premises — was the mole - catcher . The feelings with which he had now for some months watched his master grubbing were curiously mingled . There was the grim sense of superiority every successful detective feels as he sees the watched one working away unconscious of the eye that is on him ; but this was more than balanced by a long habit of obsequious reverence . When A. has been looking up to B. for thirty years , he can not look down on him all of a sudden , merely because he catches him falsifying accounts . Why , Man is a cooking animal : bankrupt Man especially . And then Richard Hardie overpowered Skinner 's senses : he was Dignity in person : he was six feet two , and always wore a black surtout buttoned high , and a hat with a brim a little broader than his neighbours ' , yet not broad enough to be eccentric or slang . He moved down the street touching his hat — while other hats were lifted high to him — a walking volume of cash . And when he took off this ebon crown and sat in the bank parlour , he gained in appearance more than he lost ; for then his whole head was seen , long , calm , majestic : that senatorial front and furrowed face overawed all comers . Even the little sharp - faced clerk would stand and peep at it , utterly puzzled between what he knew and what he eyed : nor could he look at that head and face without excusing them . What a lot of money they must have sunk before they came down to fabricating a balance - sheet ! And by - and - bye custom somewhat blunted his sense of the dishonesty , and he began to criticise the thing arithmetically instead of morally . That view once admitted , he was charmed with the ability and subtlety of his dignified sharper ; and so the mole - catcher began gradually , but effectually , to be corrupted by the mole . He who watches a dishonest process and does not stop it , is half way towards conniving : who connives , is half way towards abetting . The next thing was , Skinner felt mortified at his master not trusting him . Did he think old Bob Skinner 's son would blow on Hardie after all these years ? This rankled a little , and set him to console himself by admiring his own cleverness in penetrating this great distrustful man . Now of all sentiments , Vanity is the most restless and the surest to peep out . Skinner was no sooner inflated than his demure obsequious manner underwent a certain change : slight and occasional only ; but Hardie was a subtle man , and the perilous path he was treading made him wonderfully watchful , suspicious , and sagacious . He said to himself , “
111508	111601	111602	111602	He	617	” So he quietly watched his watcher ; and soon satisfied himself he suspected something amiss . From that hour Skinner was a doomed clerk . It was two o'clock : Hardie had just arrived , and sat in the parlour , Cato - like , and cooking . Skinner was in high spirits : it was owing to his presence of mind the bank had not been broken some hours ago by Maxley . So now , while concluding his work , he was enjoying by anticipation his employer 's gratitude . “
111610	111614	111615	111615	he	617	” said Skinner ; “
111634	111766	111615	111615	he	617	” A grave , calm , passionless voice invited him into the parlour . He descended from his desk and went in , swelling with demure complacency . He found Mr. Hardie seated garbling his accounts with surpassing dignity . The great man handed him an envelope , and cooked majestic on . A wave of that imperial hand , and Skinner had mingled with the past . For know that the envelope contained three things : a cheque for a month 's wages ; a character ; and a dismissal , very polite and equally peremptory . Skinner stood paralysed : the complacency died out of his face , and rueful wonder came instead . It was some time before he could utter a word : at last he faltered , “
111791	111871	111778	111779	Your father	1960	” Skinner uttered this his first remonstrance in a voice trembling with awe , but gathered courage when he found he had done it , yet lived . Mr. Hardie evaded his expostulation by a very simple means : he made no reply , but continued his work , dignified as Brutus , inexorable as Fate , cool as Cucumber . Skinner 's anger began to rise , he watched Mr. Hardie in silence , and said to himself , “
111882	111949	111778	111779	Your father	1960	” He waited , however , for some sign of relenting , and , hoping for it the water came into his own eyes . But Hardie was impassive as ice . Then the little clerk , mortified to the core as well as wounded , ground his teeth and drew a little nearer to this incarnate Arithmetic , and said with an excess of obsequiousness , “
111977	111978	111951	111951	you	1075	” “
111988	111994	111951	111951	you	1075	” was the cool reply : “
112015	112016	112001	112001	I	0	” “
112022	112027	112001	112001	I	0	” replied Skinner sharply : “
112046	112047	112049	112049	you	1075	” “
112062	112148	112055	112055	I	0	” And Mr. Hardie waved him away so grandly that he started and almost ran to the door . When he felt the handle , it acted like a prop to his heart . He stood firm , and rage supplied the place of steady courage . He clung to the door , and whispered at his master — such a whisper : so loud , so cutting , so full of meaning and malice ; it was like a serpent hissing at a man . “
112253	112372	112375	112375	sir	1075	” At this Mr. Hardie raised his head from his book and eyed his crouching venomous assailant full in the face , majestically , as one can fancy a lion rearing his ponderous head , and looking lazily and steadily at a snake that has just hissed in a corner . Each word of Skinner 's was a barbed icicle to him , yet not a muscle of his close countenance betrayed his inward suffering . One thing , however , even he could not master : his blood ; it retired from that stoical cheek to the chilled and foreboding heart ; and the sudden pallor of the resolute face told Skinner his shafts had gone home . “
112377	112390	112375	112375	sir	1075	” said he , affecting to mingle good fellowship with his defiance , “
112412	112413	112414	112414	You	1075	” “
112425	112426	112422	112423	Mr. Skinner	430	” “
112460	112461	112442	112442	I	0	” “
112513	112514	112517	112517	sir	1075	” “
112659	112662	112678	112678	you	1075	ledger”—Hardie winced just perceptibly—“You
112754	112773	112777	112777	you	1075	” An agony went across Mr. Hardie 's great face , and seemed to furrow as it ran . “
112784	112810	112811	112811	You	1075	” resumed his little cat - like tormentor , letting him go a little way , to nail him again by - and - bye : “
112909	112920	112905	112907	an honest man	1570	” Hardie uttered something between a growl and a moan . “
113047	113201	113202	113202	Skinner	430	” Hardie turned his head away ; and in that moment of humiliation and abject fear , drank all the bitterness of moral death . His manhood urged him to defy Skinner and return to the straight path , cost what it might . But how could he ? His own books were all falsified . He could place a true total before his creditors by simply adding the contents of his secret hoard to the assets of the Bank ; but with this true arithmetical result he could not square his books , except by conjectural and fabricated details , which would be detected , and send him to prison ; for who would believe he was lying in figures only to get back to the truth ? No , he had entangled himself in his own fraud , and was at the mercy of his servant . He took his line . “
113248	113249	113250	113250	I	0	” “
113262	113266	113250	113250	I	0	” replied Skinner hastily “
113298	113300	113301	113302	Hypocritical rogue	3879	” ( “
113304	113309	113301	113302	Hypocritical rogue	3879	” thought Hardie . ) “
113316	113320	113314	113314	Skinner	430	” said he ; “
113388	113485	113377	113377	I	0	” Thus Mr. Hardie bowed his pride to flatter Skinner , and soon saw by the little fellow 's heightened colour that this was the way to make him a clerk of wax . The banker and his clerk were reconciled . Then the latter was invited to commit himself by carrying on the culinary process in his own hand . He trembled a little , but complied , and so became an accomplice . On this his master took him into his confidence , and told him everything it was impossible to hide from him . “
113491	113495	113497	113497	me	0	” said Skinner , “
113553	113619	113543	113543	I	0	” Skinner then confided to his principal how he had evaded Maxley and saved the Bank ; and the stratagem seemed so incredible and droll , that they both laughed over it long and loud . And in fact it turned out a first - rate practical jest : cost two lives . While they were laughing , the young clerk looked in and said , “
113630	113631	113632	113633	Captain Dodd	425	” “
113637	113657	113632	113633	Captain Dodd	425	” And all Mr. Hardie 's forced merriment died away , and his face betrayed his vexation for once . “
113668	113669	113659	113659	you	1075	” “
113690	113691	113680	113680	he	425	” “
113707	113735	113696	113696	you	1075	” The youngster being gone , Mr. Hardie explained to his new ally in a few hurried words the danger that threatened him from Miss Julia Dodd . “
113739	113743	113744	113745	the women	9506	” said he , “
113781	113799	113774	113774	I	0	” On this Skinner got up all in a hurry and offered to go into the office . “
113804	113810	113774	113774	I	0	” said Mr. Hardie sharply . “
113842	113907	113911	113911	sir	1075	” He then touched the bell , and both confederates fell into an attitude : never were a pair so bent over their little accounts — lies , like themselves . Instead of the heart - broken father their comedy awaited , in came the gallant sailor with a brown cheek reddened by triumph and excitement and almost shouted in a genial jocund voice , “
113925	113958	113919	113919	I	0	” And with this he held out his hand cordially . Hardie gave his mechanically , and remained on his guard , but somewhat puzzled . Dodd shook his cold hand heartily . “
113985	113986	113980	113980	d'ye	3896	” “
113994	114005	113987	113987	I	0	” said Hardie : then , rather stiffly and incredulously , “
114040	114041	114017	114017	you	1075	” “
114070	114246	114063	114063	I	0	” Hardie stared , but was as much on his guard as ever ; only more and more puzzled . Then David winked at him with simple cunning , took out his knife , undid his shirt , and began to cut the threads which bound the Cash to his flannel . At this Skinner wheeled round on his stool to look , and both he and Mr. Hardie inspected the unusual pantomime with demure curiosity . Dodd next removed the oilskin cover , and showed the pocket - book , brought it down with a triumphant smack on the hollow of his hand , and , in the pride of his heart , the joy of his bosom and the fever of his blood — for there were two red spots on his cheek all the time — told the cold pair Its adventures in a few glowing words : the Calcutta firm — the two pirates — the hurricane — the wreck — the land - sharks — he had saved it from . “
114291	114292	114275	114275	you	3900	” “
114312	114313	114304	114305	Mrs. Dodd	253	” “
114333	114334	114331	114331	me	0	” “
114339	114340	114336	114336	you	3900	” “
114351	114352	114349	114349	sir	1075	” “
114357	114364	114349	114349	sir	1075	” said Hardie a little sneeringly . “
114389	114403	114376	114376	I	0	” Then he lowered his voice , and said with a certain awe : “
114411	114412	114376	114376	I	0	” “
114419	114430	114376	114376	I	0	” cried Hardie . Then with sudden and consummate coolness , “
114459	114460	114452	114452	you	430	” “
114465	114469	114452	114452	you	430	” said Dodd . “
114493	114535	114484	114484	I	0	” He then opened the pocket - book and spread the contents out before Mr. Hardie , who ran over the notes and bills , and said the amount was 14,010,l . 12s . 6d . Dodd asked for a receipt . “
114548	114554	114484	114484	I	0	” Dodd 's countenance fell : “
114571	114572	114573	114573	You	3900	” “
114577	114584	114573	114573	You	3900	” said Hardie with a smile . “
114606	114688	114573	114573	You	3900	” He then unlocked a desk , took out a banker 's receipt ; and told Skinner to fill it in . This done , he seemed to be absorbed in some more important matter . Skinner counted the notes and left them with Mr. Hardie ; the bills he took to his desk to note them on the back of the receipt . Whilst he was writing this with his usual slowness and precision , poor Dodd 's heart overflowed . “
114957	114971	114975	114976	little gentleman	3931	” Skinner handed him the receipt . He cast his eye over it . “
115034	115128	115029	115029	God	481	” And with this burst he was out of the room and making ardently for Albion Villa . The banker and his clerk turned round on their seats and eyed one another a long time in silence and amazement . Was this thing a dream ? their faces seemed to ask . Then Mr. Hardie rested his senatorial head on his hand and pondered deeply . Skinner too reflected on this strange freak of Fortune : and the result was that he burst in on his principal 's reverie with a joyful shout : “
115143	115170	115134	115134	Hardie	264	” The banker started , for Skinner 's voice sounded like a pistol - shot in his ear , so high strung was he with thought . “
115175	115192	115134	115134	Hardie	264	” he said , and pondered again in silence . At last he turned to Skinner . “
115222	115223	115200	115200	I	0	” “
115234	115235	115200	115200	I	0	” “
115283	115297	115280	115280	me	0	” After a while he took a sheet of paper , and jotted down “
115301	115316	115280	115280	me	0	” as he called them , and read them out to his accomplice : — “
115353	115386	115389	115390	Alfred Hardie	312	“ 2 . Miss Julia Dodd , virtual proprietor of this 14,000,l . or of the greater part , if I choose . The child that marries first usually jockeys the other . “
115432	115462	115389	115390	Alfred Hardie	312	“ 4 . The 14,000l . paid to me personally after banking hours , and not entered on the banking books , nor known but to you and me . “
115505	115591	115592	115592	Skinner	430	“ In that interval I talk Alfred over , and promise to produce the L.14,000 intact , with my paternal blessing on him and Miss Dodd , provided he will release me from my debt to him , and give me a life interest in half the money settled on him by my wife 's father , to my most unjust and insolent exclusion . Their passion will soon bring the young people to reason , and then they will soon melt the old ones . ”
115608	115620	115602	115602	he	430	“ You do n't say what is to become of me . ”
115621	115632	115592	115592	Skinner	430	“ Oh , I have n't thought of that yet . ”
115633	115670	115602	115602	he	430	“ But do think of it , sir , that I may have the pleasure of co - operating . It would never do for you and me to be pulling two ways , you know . ”
115671	115678	115680	115680	Hardie	312	“ I will not forget you , ”
115702	115954	115955	115955	Skinner	430	“ But surely , Skinner , you agree with me it would be a sin and a shame to rob this honest captain of his money — for my creditors — curse them ! Ah ! you are not a father . How quickly he found that out ! Well , I am , and he touched me to the quick . I love my little Jane as dearly as he loves his Julia , every bit : and I feel for him . And then he put me in mind of my own father , poor man . That seems strange , does n't it ? a sailor and a banker . Ah ! it was because they were both honest men . Yes , it was like a wholesome flower coming into a close room , and then out again and heaving a whiff behind was that sailor . He left the savour of Probity and Simplicity behind , though he took the things themselves away again . Why , why could n't he leave us what is more wanted here than even his money ? His integrity : the pearl of price , that my father , whom I used to sneer at , carried to his grave ; and died simple , but wise ; honest , but rich — rich in money , in credit , in honour , and eternal hopes . Oh , Skinner ! Skinner ! I wish I had never been born . ”
116011	116019	116021	116023	the little clerk	3946	“ Do n't talk so , sir , ”
116025	116037	116021	116023	the little clerk	3946	“ Keep up your heart ! Have a drop of something . ”
116038	116043	116045	116046	Mr. Hardie	312	“ You are right , ”
116049	116064	116045	116046	Mr. Hardie	312	“ it is idle to talk : we are all the slaves of circumstances . ”
116284	116295	116297	116297	Maxley	394	“ I ca n't afford to go with the creditors , ”
116299	116323	116297	116297	Maxley	394	“ Dividend on 30s . ! Why , that will be about thirty pence : the change for a hard half - crown . ”
116393	116409	116371	116371	Maxley	394	“ What , is it over the town already that my ship has been wrecked ? ”
116415	116445	116411	116411	Dodd	278	“ Wrecked ? No ; but you have been due this two months , ye know . Wrecked ? Why , Captain , you have n't ever been wrecked ? ”
116458	116460	116447	116447	he	394	“ WRECKED ”
116468	116524	116447	116447	he	394	“ Ay , James , wrecked on the French coast , and lost my chronometer , and a tip - top sextant . But what of that ? I saved It . I have just landed It in the Bank . Good - bye ; I must sheer off : I long to be home . ”
116525	116532	116534	116534	Maxley	394	“ Stay a bit , Captain , ”
116536	116592	116534	116534	Maxley	394	“ I am not quite easy in my mind . I saw you come out of Hardie 's . I thought in course you had been in to draa : but you says different . Now what was it you did leave behind you at that there shop , if you please : not money ? ”
116593	116626	116628	116628	he	394	“ Not money ? Only 14,000l .. How the man stares ! Why , it 's not mine , James ; it 's my children 's : there , good - bye ; ”
116656	116661	116663	116663	he	394	“ Be you mad ? ”
116666	116677	116663	116663	he	394	“ No , but I begin to think you are . ”
116678	116685	116687	116687	Maxley	394	“ That is to be seen , ”
116690	116726	116687	116687	Maxley	394	“ Before I lets you go , you must tell me whether you be jesting , or whether you have really been so simple as to drop fourteen — thousand — pounds at Hardie 's ? ”
116772	116788	116766	116766	Dodd	278	“ Why , good heavens , there is nothing wrong with the old Barkington Bank ? ”
116789	116793	116795	116795	Maxley	394	“ Nothing wrong ? ”
116801	116824	116795	116795	Maxley	394	“ Holt ! I was laad once for slander , and cost me thirty pounds : nearly killed my missus it did . ”
116825	116828	116830	116830	Dodd	278	“ Man ! ”
116832	116865	116830	116830	Dodd	278	“ for my children 's sake tell me if you know anything amiss . After all , I 'm like a stranger here ; more than two years away at a time . ”
116866	116875	116877	116877	Maxley	394	“ I 'll tell you all I know , ”
116879	116950	116877	116877	Maxley	394	“ ' tis the least I can do . What ( roaring ) do — you — think — I've forgotten you saving my poor boy out o ' that scrape , and getting him a good place in Canada , and — why , he 'd have been put in prison but for you , and that would ha ' broken my heart and his mother's — and — — ”
116958	116966	116968	116968	Dodd	278	“ Oh , bother all that now , ”
116971	116982	116968	116968	Dodd	278	“ The bank ! you have grounded me on thorns . ”
116983	117027	116830	116830	Dodd	278	“ Well , I 'll tell ye : but you must promise faithful not to go and say I told ye , or you 'll get me laad again : and I likes to laa them , not for they to laa me . ”
117028	117035	116968	116968	Dodd	278	“ I promise , I promise . ”
117036	117131	116968	116968	Dodd	278	“ Well then , I got a letter to - day from my boy , him as you was so good to , and here ' tis in my breeches - pocket.—Laws ! how things do come round surely : why , lookee here now ; if so be you had n't been a good friend to he , he would n't be where he is ; and if so be he warn't where he is , he could n't have writ me this here , and then where should you and I be ? ”
117132	117142	117144	117144	David	278	“ Belay your jaw and show me this letter , ”
117150	117155	117157	117157	Maxley	394	“ That I wool , ”
117166	117218	117219	117219	He	394	“ Hush ! lookee yander now ; if there ai n't Master Alfred a - watching of us two out of his window : and he have got an eye like a hawk , he have . Step in the passage , Captain , and I 'll show it to you . ”
117332	117336	117338	117338	he	394	“ There now , ”
117342	117366	117338	117338	he	394	“ if Hardies do laa me for publishing of this here letter , why they pours their water into a sieve . Ugh ! ”
117428	117433	117435	117435	Maxley	394	“ I 'm laad , ”
117437	117443	117445	117445	Alfred	312	“ Maxley , old fellow , ”
117457	117465	117445	117445	Alfred	312	“ are you in a good humour ? ”
117466	117489	117499	117499	his	312	“ Well , Master , Halfred , sight of you mostly puts me in one , especially after that there strychnine job . ”
117490	117495	117497	117497	Alfred	312	“ Then tell me , ”
117507	117524	117503	117503	his	312	“ who was that you were talking to just now ? Was it?—wasn't it?—who was it ? ”
117571	117586	117547	117547	he	278	“ I have changed my mind , sir : I want my money back . ”
117616	117625	117612	117612	He	312	“ Certainly . May I ask — — ? ”
117640	117644	117646	117646	Dodd	278	“ No matter , ”
117657	117670	117646	117646	Dodd	278	“ Come ! my money ! I must and will have it . ”
117677	117693	117673	117673	himself	312	“ Captain Dodd , this is a strange way of demanding what nobody here disputes . ”
117694	117702	117704	117704	Dodd	425	“ Well , I beg your pardon , ”
117715	117723	117704	117704	Dodd	425	“ but I ca n't help it . ”
117831	117959	117824	117825	The latter	8440	“ You see , sir , it 's my children 's fortune , my boy Edward 's , and my little Julia 's : and so many have been trying to get it from me , that my blood boils up in a moment about it now.—My poor head!—You do n't seem to understand what I am saying ! There then , I am a sailor ; I ca n't go beating and tacking like you landsmen , with the wind dead astern . The long and the short is , I do n't feel It safe here : do n't feel It safe anywhere , except in my wife 's lap . So no more words : here 's your receipt ; give me my money . ”
117960	117994	117824	117825	The latter	8440	“ Certainly , Captain Dodd . Call to - morrow morning at the bank , and it will be paid on demand in the regular way : the bank opens at ten o'clock . ”
117995	118028	118180	118181	The cashier	10506	“ No , no ; I ca n't wait . I should be dead of anxiety before then . Why not pay it me here and now ? You took it here . ”
118029	118053	117824	117825	The latter	8440	“ We receive deposits till four o'clock , but we do not disburse after three . This is the system of all banks . ”
118054	118075	117824	117825	The latter	8440	“ That is all nonsense : if you are open to receive money , you are open to pay it . ”
118076	118166	118167	118168	The cashier	10506	“ My dear sir , if you were not entirely ignorant of business , you would be aware that these things are not done in this way . Money received is passed to account , and the cashier is the only person who can honour your draft on it . But , stop ; if the cashier is in the bank , we may manage it for you yet . Skinner , run and see whether he has left : and if not , send him to me directly . ”
118192	118204	118180	118181	The cashier	10506	“ The cashier has been gone this quarter of an hour . ”
118211	118216	118218	118218	Hardie	312	“ That is unfortunate , ”
118220	118297	118218	118218	Hardie	312	“ But , after all , it is only till to - morrow morning . Still I regret this circumstance , sir ; and I feel that all these precautions we are obliged to take must seem unreasonable to you . But experience dictates this severe routine , and , were we to deviate from it , our friends ' money would not be so safe in our hands as it always has been at present . ”

118342	118360	118339	118339	Hardie	312	“ No , no ; but because he has locked it up and carried away the key . ”
118361	118371	118317	118317	David	278	“ It is not in this room , then ? ”
118372	118375	118317	118317	David	278	“ No . ”
118376	118381	118339	118339	Hardie	312	“ Are you sure ? ”
118382	118385	118317	118317	David	278	“ Positive . ”
118386	118398	118317	118317	David	278	“ What , not in that safe of yours , there ? ”
118399	118403	118405	118405	Hardie	312	“ Certainly not , ”
118408	118419	118405	118405	Hardie	312	“ Open the safe : the keys are in it . ”
118420	118428	118317	118317	David	278	“ Open the safe ? What for ? ”
118429	118450	118452	118452	David	278	“ To show me It is not in the right - hand partition of that safe ; there : there . ”
118510	118536	118505	118505	he	312	“ You are impertinent , sir , and I shall not reward your curiosity and your insolence by showing you the contents of my safe . ”
118537	118544	118546	118546	David	278	“ My money ! my money ! ”
118549	118618	118546	118546	David	278	“ no more words , for I sha n't listen to them : I know you now for what you are — a thief ! I saw you put it into that safe : a liar is always a thief . You want to steal my children 's money : I 'll have your life first . My money ! ye pirate ! or I 'll strangle you . ”
118643	118713	118714	118714	His	3973	“ D'ye know what I did to a French land - shark that tried to rob me of It ? I throttled him with these fingers till his eyes and his tongue started out of him . He came for my children 's money , and I killed him so — so — so — as I 'll kill you , you thief ! you liar ! you scoundrel ! ”
118763	118769	118770	118770	he	3973	“ Hush ! no violence ! ”
118773	118785	118770	118770	he	3973	“ I 'll give you your money this moment you ruffian . ”
119035	119046	119048	119048	he	430	“ It is a bad day 's work , sir , ”
119052	119059	119048	119048	he	430	“ he is a dead man . ”
119060	119066	119100	119100	he	430	“ Dead ? Heaven forbid ! ”
119067	119070	119072	119072	Skinner	430	“ Apoplexy ! ”
119074	119098	119100	119100	he	430	“ Run for a doctor then : lose no time : do n't let us have his blood on our hands ! Dead ? ”
119185	119190	119192	119193	Mr. Hardie	312	“ Come , run ! ”
119195	119208	119192	119193	Mr. Hardie	312	“ I 'll take care of him ; every moment is precious . ”
119210	119218	119220	119220	Skinner	430	“ Wants to get rid of me ! ”
119223	119228	119230	119230	he	430	“ No , sir , ”

119270	119278	119268	119268	Hardie	312	“ How lucky if he should die ! ”
119306	119314	119316	119316	he	312	“ At least : give him air ! ”
119554	119596	119549	119549	He	312	“ The matter has gone too far to stop ; I must go on borrowing this money of the Dodds , and make it the basis of a large fortune : it will be best for all parties in the end . ”
119649	119653	119636	119636	he	312	“ Five pounds . ”
119654	119660	119715	119715	Maxley	394	“ That is too much . ”
119661	119667	119636	119636	he	312	“ Five shillings , then . ”
119668	119704	119636	119636	he	312	“ That is too little . Lookee here ; your garden owes me thirty shillings for work : suppose you pays me , and that will save me from going to your Dad for it . ”
119728	119737	119739	119739	Alfred	312	“ I thought so ! I thought so ! ”
119742	119787	119789	119789	he	312	“ but I was afraid to believe it : it was too delightful . Maxley , you 're a trump you do n't know what anxiety you have relieved me of . Some fool has gone and reported the Agia wrecked ; look here ! ”
119796	119812	119789	119789	he	312	“ Luckily it has only just come , so I have n't been miserable long . ”
119813	119837	119838	119838	He	312	“ Well , to be sure , news flies fast now - a - days . He have been wrecked for that matter . ”
119946	119950	119952	119952	he	312	“ Mr. Alfred , ”
119954	120148	119952	119952	he	312	“ I know the world better than you do : you be ruled by me , or you 'll rue it . You put on your Sunday coat this minute , and off like a shot to Albyn Villee ; you 'll get there before the Captain ; he have got a little business to do first ; that is neither here nor there : besides , you are young and lissom . You be the first to tell Missus Dodd the good news ; and , when the Captain comes , there sits you aside Miss Julee : and do n't you be shy and shamefaced , take him when his heart is warm , and tell him why you are there : ' I love her dear , ' says you . He be only a sailor and they never has no sense nor prudence ; he is a'most sure to take you by the hand , at such a time : and once you get his word , he 'll stand good , to his own hurt . He 's one of that sort , bless his silly old heart . ”
120307	120311	120298	120298	She	255	“ O Alfred ! ”
120312	120316	120317	120317	he	312	“ Good news ! ”
120320	120365	120317	120317	he	312	“ He is alive — Maxley has seen him — I have seen him — he will be here directly — my own love , dry your eyes — calm your fears — he is safe — he is well : hurrah ! hurrah ! ”
120389	120398	120399	120399	she	255	“ Oh , bless you ! bless you ! ”
120451	120456	120423	120423	she	255	“ Mamma ! mamma ! ”
120665	120677	120679	120679	Julia	255	“ And then it was he who brought the good news , ”
120684	120691	120679	120679	Julia	255	“ and that is so sweet . ”
120692	120697	120699	120700	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Yes , dear , ”
120702	120725	120699	120700	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ he will make even me love him . The 14,000l . ! I hope that was not lost in the wreck . ”
120726	120834	120835	120836	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Oh , mamma ! who cares when his own dear , sweet , precious life has been in danger , and is mercifully preserved ? Why does he not come ? I shall scold him for keeping us waiting . You know I am not a bit afraid of him , though he is papa . Indeed , I am ashamed to say I govern him with a rod of — no matter what . Do , do , do let us all three put on our bonnets , and run and meet him . I want him so to love somebody the very first day . ”
120839	120876	120835	120836	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Well , wait a few minutes , and then , if he is not here , you two shall go . I dare hardly trust myself to meet my darling husband in the open street . ”
120882	120901	120877	120877	Julia	255	“ If he does not come in ten minutes , you and I may go and meet him . ”
120902	120908	120910	120910	Alfred	312	“ You are an angel , ”
120912	120917	120919	120919	Julia	255	“ You are another , ”
120922	120980	120919	120919	Julia	255	“ Oh , dear , I ca n't sit down , and I do n't want flattery : I want papa . A waltz ! a waltz ! then one can go mad with joy without startling propriety . I ca n't answer for the consequences if I do n't let off a little , little happiness . ”
120981	120986	120988	120989	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ That I will , ”
120991	121003	121004	121004	She	253	“ for I am as happy as you , and happier . ”
121120	121134	121135	121135	Alfred	312	“ His chest his chest ! he is coming , coming , come ! ”
121209	121242	121194	121194	She	255	“ Is it his clothes ? Then he was n't so much wrecked after all . Is he with you ? Is he coming directly ? Why do n't you tell me ? ”
121338	121345	121312	121313	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Julia ! ! Julia ! ! ”
121558	121567	121569	121570	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ My son , where is my son ? ”
121580	121592	121572	121572	Alfred	312	“ You have one son here : what shall I do ? ”
121652	121674	121638	121638	he	425	“ I have paid the men , sir ; I would n't let them ask the ladies at such a time . ”
121675	121698	121638	121638	he	425	“ Oh , thank you ! thank you , Skinner ! I will repay you ; it is me you have obliged . ”
121717	121735	121710	121710	Skinner	430	“ I forgot him . It is a nice mess . Wish I was out of it . ”
121797	121807	121809	121809	she	253	“ Oh , let us try everything else first , ”
121821	121836	121812	121812	Osmond	326	“ All the functions we rely on in the exhibition of medicines are suspended . ”
121907	121914	121899	121899	he	326	“ I advise venesection or cupping . ”
121915	121938	121899	121899	he	326	“ Oh , Dr. Short , pray have pity and order something less terrible . Dr. Sampson is so averse to bleeding . ”
121939	121949	121899	121899	he	326	“ Sampson ? Sampson ? never heard of him . ”
121950	121957	121959	121959	Osmond	326	“ It is the chronothermal man , ”
121961	122040	121959	121959	Osmond	326	“ Oh , ah ! but this is too serious a case to be quacked . Coma with stertor , and a full , bounding pulse , indicates liberal bloodletting . I would try venesection ; then cup , if necessary , or leech the temple . I need not say , sir , calomel must complete the cure . The case is simple , and , at present , surgical : I leave it in competent hands . ”
122107	122123	122124	122125	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ But in apoplexy the leech and the lancet are still our sheet - anchor . ”
122131	122150	122124	122125	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Apoplexy ! Oh , David ! Oh , my darling , have you come home for this ? ”
122375	122380	122382	122382	Osmond	326	“ Good sign that ! ”
122384	122393	122395	122396	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Oh , that is enough , sir , ”
122398	122408	122395	122396	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ we shall faint if you take any more . ”
122474	122485	122466	122466	she	253	“ You see I could not have lost any more . ”
122550	122557	122559	122561	poor Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Oh , hush ! hush ! ”
122646	122653	122655	122656	Mr. Osmond	326	“ We have turned the corner . ”
122683	122757	122670	122671	Dr. Sampson	357	“ Out visiting patients when yours came . In apoplexy with a red face and stertorous breathing , put the feet in mustard bath and dash much cold water on the head from above . On revival give emetic : cure with sulphate of quinine . In apoplexy with a white face , treat as for a simple faint : here emetic dangerous . In neither apoplexy bleed . Coming down by train . ”
122788	122794	122796	122796	he	326	“ Not bleed in apoplexy ! ”
122799	122817	122796	122796	he	326	“ why , it is the universal practice . Judge for yourself . You see the improvement . ”
122823	122831	122833	122833	Osmond	326	“ Then as to the cold water , ”
122835	122870	122871	122871	He	326	“ I would hardly advise so rough a remedy . And he is going on so well . But you can send for ice ; and meantime give me a good - sized stocking . ”
123058	123088	123051	123051	his	357	“ This is the cold fit come on : we must not shut our eyes on the pashint . Why , what is this ? he has been cupped ! ”
123106	123183	123098	123099	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ I could not hear from you ; and Dr. Short and Mr. Osmond felt quite sure : and he seems better . Oh , Dr. Sampson , why were you not here ? We have bled him as well . Oh , do n't , do n't , do n't say it was wrong ! He would have died ; they said so . Oh , David ! David ! your wife has killed you . ”
123216	123221	123223	123223	he	357	“ No , no , ”
123225	123271	123223	123223	he	357	“ do n't go on so , my poor soul ; you did all for the best ; and now we must make the best of what is done . Hartshorn ! brandy ! and caution ! For those two assassins have tied my hands . ”
123333	123340	123342	123342	Sampson	357	“ Then the cause is mintil , ”
123344	123358	123342	123342	Sampson	357	“ unless he got a blow on the hid in bein ' wrecked . ”
123374	123381	123383	123383	he	357	“ But this is not it , ”
123385	123390	123383	123383	he	357	“ this is old . ”
123474	123487	123468	123468	he	357	“ It is a stab — with a one - edged knife . ”
123496	123504	123506	123506	Sampson	357	“ Do n't alarm yourselves for that , ”
123508	123624	123506	123506	Sampson	357	“ it is nothing : a mere flesh - wound . It is the vein - wound that alarms me . This school knows nothing about the paroxysms and remissions of disease . They have bled and cupped him for a passing fit . It has passed into the cold stage , but no quicker than it would have done without stealing a drop of blood . To - morrow , by disease 's nature , he will have another hot fit in spite of their bleeding . Then those ijjits would leech his temples ; and on that paroxysm remitting by the nature of the disease , would fancy their leeches had cured it . ”

123982	123985	123973	123973	he	357	“ Lucy ! ”
123999	124004	124006	124006	he	357	“ Gently ! gently ! ”
124008	124016	124006	124006	he	357	“ we must have no violent emotions . ”
124017	124027	124029	124029	she	253	“ Oh , no ! I will be prudent . ”
124107	124126	124104	124104	He	326	“ Dr. Sampson is a notorious quack : no physician of any eminence will meet him in consultation . ”
124127	124133	124135	124136	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ I regret that resolution , ”
124139	124152	124135	124136	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ as it will deprive me of the advantage of your skill . ”
124158	124177	124179	124179	he	326	“ I shall be at your service , madam , when that empiric has given the patient up . ”
124540	124549	124523	124523	she	253	“ Ma'am ! Ma'am ! Is he here ? ”
124550	124555	124557	124558	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ He ! Who ? ”
124562	124573	124557	124558	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Why , him ! He ca n't be far off ”
124610	124619	124620	124621	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Call my son ! Alarm the house ! ”
124757	124774	124738	124738	Julia	255	“ Said nothing , Miss ? Why he was a - talking all the night incessant . ”
124775	124785	124738	124738	Julia	255	“ Did he say anything particular ? think now . ”
124786	124815	124738	124738	Julia	255	“ No , Miss : he went on as they all do just before a change . I never minds 'em ; I hear so much of it . ”
124816	124832	124738	124738	Julia	255	“ Oh , nurse ! nurse ! have pity on me ; try and recollect . ”
124833	124862	124738	124738	Julia	255	“ Well , Miss , to oblige you then ; it was mostly fights this time — and wrecks — and villains — and bankers — and sharks . ”
124863	124868	124870	124870	Julia	255	“ Bankers ? ? ! ”
124873	124985	124870	124870	Julia	255	“ Yes , Miss , and villains , they come once or twice , but most of the time it was sharks , and ships , and money , and — hotch - potch I call it the way they talk . Bless your heart , they know no better : everything they ever saw , or read , or heard tell of — it all comes out higgledy - piggledy just before they goes off . We that makes it a business never takes no notice of what they says , Miss , and never repeats it out of one sick house into another , that you may rely on . ”
125096	125110	125079	125079	Sarah	281	“ Oh , Miss , nurse thinks you had much better not go . ”
125111	125128	125055	125055	She	255	“ Nurse thinks ! Nurse thinks ! What does she know of me and my griefs ? ”
125129	125165	125055	125055	She	255	“ Why , Miss , she is a very experienced woman , and she says — Oh , dear ! oh , dear ! And such a dark cold night for you to be out ! ”
125166	125176	125079	125079	Sarah	281	“ Nurse ? Nurse ? What did she say ? ”
125177	125220	125055	125055	She	255	“ Oh , I have n't the heart to tell you : if you would but come back home with me ! She says as much as that poor master 's troubles will be over long before we can get to him . ”

125256	125449	125055	125055	She	255	“ Miss , she says she nursed Mr. Campbell , the young curate that died last harvest - time but one , you know ; and he lay just like master , and she expecting a change every hour : and oh , Miss , she met him coming down - stairs in his nightgown : and he said , ' Nurse , I am all right now , ' says he , and died momently in her arms at the stair - foot . And she nursed an old farmer that lay as weak as master , and just when they looked for him to go , lo ! and behold him dressed and out digging potatoes , and fell down dead before they could get hands on him mostly : and nurse have a friend , that have seen more than she have , which she is older than nurse , and says a body 's life is all one as a rushlight , flares up strong momently just before it goes out altogether . Dear heart ! where ever are we going to in the middle of the night ? ”
125450	125460	125491	125493	a drunken man	4124	“ Do n't you see ? To the quay . ”
125461	125489	125055	125055	She	255	“ Oh , do n't go there , Miss , whatever ! I ca n't abide the sight of the water when a body 's in trouble . ”
125531	125536	125538	125538	Sarah	281	“ Oh , Miss , ”
125540	125571	125538	125538	Sarah	281	“ what could you expect , coming out at this time of night ? I 'm sure the breath is all out of me , you do tear along so . ”
125572	125601	125603	125603	she	255	“ Tear ? we are crawling . Ah ! Sarah , you are not his daughter . There , follow me ! I can not go so slow . ”
126321	126329	126330	126330	she	253	“ And he does not know me , ”

133086	133135	133060	133061	Mrs. Maxley	324	“ Well , and so I have , ye foolish woman ; and he drew the whole packet out of his pocket and flung them fiercely on the table . Mrs. Maxley ran her finger and eye over them , and uttered a scream of anger and despair . “
133145	133149	133141	133141	Hardie	312	” she cried ; “
133163	133182	133141	133141	Hardie	312	” Maxley staggered as if he had been shot . The woman 's eyes flashed fury at him . “
133273	133388	133389	133389	I	0	” And in her ungovernable passion , she actually ran to the dresser for a knife : at which Maxley caught up a chair and lifted it furiously , above his head to fling at her . Luckily the man had more self - command than the woman ; he dashed the chair furiously on the floor , and ran out of the house . He wandered about half stupid , and presently his feet took him mechanically round to his garden . He pottered about among his plants , looking at them , inspecting them closely , and scarce seeing them . However , he covered up one or two , and muttered , “
133407	133443	133400	133400	I	0	” Then his legs seemed to give way . He sat down and thought of his wedding - day : he began to talk to himself out loud , as some people do in trouble . “
133449	133453	133400	133400	I	0	” said he , “
133559	133634	133551	133551	I	0	” He went round to his front door . There was a crowd round it ; a buzzing crowd with all their faces turned towards his door . He came at their backs , and asked peevishly what was to do now . Some of the women shrieked at his voice . The crowd turned about ; and a score of faces peered at him : some filled with curiosity , some with pity . “
133639	133645	133551	133551	I	0	” said the poor man , “
133667	133668	133635	133635	Lord	4402	” “
133673	133678	133635	133635	Lord	4402	” cried a woman , “
133684	133685	133635	133635	Lord	4402	” “
133698	133704	133635	133635	Lord	4402	” said Maxley with dignity : “
133710	133711	133635	133635	Lord	4402	” “
133725	133726	133722	133723	Poor man	10453	” “
133730	133734	133722	133723	Poor man	10453	” said another . “
133738	133744	133722	133723	Poor man	10453	” said a strange man . “
133758	133969	133722	133723	Poor man	10453	” A lane was made directly , and Maxley rushed down between two rows of peering faces , with his knees knocking together , and burst into his own house . A scream from the women inside as he entered , and a deep groan from the strong man bereaved of his mate , told the tragedy . Poor Susan Maxley was gone . She had died of breast - pang within a minute of his leaving her ; and the last words of two faithful spouses were words of anger . All these things , and many more less tragic , but very deplorable , came to Alfred Hardie 's knowledge , and galled and afflicted him deeply . And several of these revelations heaped discredit high upon Richard Hardie , till the young man , born with a keen sense of justice , and bred amongst honourable minds , began to shudder at his own father . Herein he was alone ; Jane , with the affectionate blindness of her sex , could throw her arms round her father 's neck , and pity him for his losses — by his own dishonesty — and pity him most when some victim of his unprincipled conduct died or despaired . “
133978	134335	133970	133971	Poor papa	4407	” was her only comment on such occasions . Alfred was not sorry she could take this view , and left her unmolested to confound black with white , and wrong with right , at affection 's dictates ; but his own trained understanding was not to be duped in matters of plain morality . And so , unable to cure the wrongs he deplored , unable to put his conscience into his pocket like Richard Hardie , or into his heart like Jane , he wandered alone , or sat brooding and dejected : and the attentive reader , if I am so fortunate as to possess one , will not be surprised to learn that he was troubled , too , with dark mysterious surmises he half dreaded , yet felt it his duty to fathom . These and Mrs. Dodd 's loss by the bank combined to keep him out of Albion Villa . He often called to ask after Captain Dodd , but was ashamed to enter the house . Now Richard Hardie 's anxiety to know whether David was to die or live had not declined , but rather increased . If the latter , he was now resolved to fly to the United States with his booty , and cheat his alienated son along with the rest : he had come by degrees down to this . It was on Alfred he had counted to keep him informed of David 's state ; but , on his putting a smooth inquiry , the young man 's face flushed with shame , or anger , or something , and he gave a very short , sharp , and obscure reply . In reality , he did not know much , nor did Sarah , his informant ; for of late the servants had never been allowed to enter David 's room . Mr. Hardie , after this rebuff , never asked Alfred again ; but having heard Sampson 's name mentioned as Dodd 's medical attendant , wrote and asked him to come and dine next time he should visit Barkington . “
134344	134348	134340	134342	a fallen man	4409	” said he ; “
134485	134489	134491	134491	he	312	“ I understand , ”
134493	134509	134491	134491	he	312	“ you have wrought one of your surprising cures in this neighbourhood . Albion Villa ! ”
134529	134576	134522	134522	Alfred	312	“ How can I work a great cure after these ass - ass - ins Short and Osmond ? Look , see ! the man had been wounded in the hid , and lost blood : thin stabbed in the shoulder , and lost more blood . ”—Both
134584	134703	134577	134578	the Hardies	274	surprise.—“So , instid of recruiting the buddy thus exhausted of the great liquid material of all repair , the profissional ass - ass - in came and exhausted him worse : stabbed him while he slept ; stabbed him unconscious , stabbed him in a vein : and stole more blood from him . Was n't that enough ? No ! the routine of profissional ass - ass - ination had but begun ; nixt they stabbed him with cupping - needles , and so stole more of his life - blood . And they were goen from their stabs to their bites , goen to leech his temples , and so hand him over to the sixton . ”
134704	134713	134715	134715	Alfred	312	“ But you came in and saved him , ”
134717	134723	134725	134725	Sampson	357	“ I saved his life , ”
134728	134766	134725	134725	Sampson	357	“ but life is not the only good thing a man may be robbed of by those who steal his life - blood , and so impoverish and water the contints of the vessels of the brain . ”
134767	134771	134773	134773	Alfred	312	“ Doctor Sampson , ”
134775	134789	134773	134773	Alfred	312	“ what do you mean by these mysterious words ? You alarm me . ”
134790	134804	134725	134725	Sampson	357	“ What , do n't you know ? Have n't they told you ? ”
134805	134823	134824	134824	he	312	“ No , I have not had the courage to enter the house since the bank — — ”
134829	134835	134837	134837	Sampson	357	“ Ay , I understand , ”
134839	134850	134837	134837	Sampson	357	“ however , it ca n't be hidden now : — “
134856	134941	134853	134854	a maniac	4418	” Sampson made this awful announcement soberly and sorrowfully . Alfred groaned aloud , and even his father experienced a momentary remorse ; but so steady had been the progress of Corruption , that he felt almost unmixed joy the next instant ; and his keen - witted son surprised the latter sentiment in his face , and shuddered with disgust . Sampson went on to say that he believed the poor man had gone flourishing a razor ; and Mrs. Dodd had said , “
134956	135016	134947	134947	David	278	” and never moved : which feminine , or in other words irrational , behaviour had somehow disarmed him . But it would not happen again : his sister had come ; a sensible , resolute woman . She had signed the order , and Osmond and he the certificates , and he was gone to a private asylum . “
135021	135028	135029	135029	I	0	” said Sampson , rising suddenly , “
135063	135148	135055	135055	I	0	” On his departure , Jane returned and made the tea in the dining - room : they lived like that now . Mr. Hardie took it from his favourite 's lithe white hand , and smiled on her : he should not have to go to a foreign land after all : who would believe a madman if he should rave about his thousands ? He sipped his tea luxuriously , and presently delivered himself thus , with bland self - satisfaction : — “
135306	135307	135301	135301	He	425	” “
135325	135332	135339	135339	Sampson	357	” She thought of Edward first . “
135366	135410	135411	135411	I	0	” At this conclusion , which struck her obliquely , though aimed at Alfred , Jane sighed gently , and her dream of earthly happiness seemed to melt away . But Alfred ground his teeth , and replied with great bitterness and emotion : “
135455	135456	135446	135446	they	4431	” “
135461	135468	135446	135446	they	4431	” put in Mr. Hardie calmly . “
135484	135492	135493	135493	I	0	” Mr. Hardie assumed a puzzled air . “
135531	135532	135507	135507	Sampson	357	” “
135547	135548	135538	135539	Dr. Sampson	357	” “
135561	135585	135591	135591	sir	1075	” The son fixed his eyes on the father , and leaned across the table to him , till their faces nearly met . “
135593	135710	135591	135591	sir	1075	” MR . HARDIE was taken by surprise for once , and had not a word to say , but looked in his son 's face , mute and gasping as a fish . During this painful silence his children eyed him inquiringly , but not with the same result ; for one face is often read differently by two persons . To Jane , whose intelligence had no aids , he seemed unaffectedly puzzled ; but Alfred discerned beneath his wonder the terror of detection rising , and then thrust back by the strong will : that stoical face shut again like an iron door , but not quickly enough : the right words , the “
135714	135880	135591	135591	sir	1075	” had been spoken , and one unguarded look had confirmed Alfred 's vague suspicions of foul play . He turned his own face away : he was alienated by the occurrences of the last few months , but Nature and tender reminiscences still held him by some fibres of the heart — in a moment of natural indignation he had applied the touchstone , but its success grieved him . He could not bear to go on exposing his father ; so he left the room with a deep sigh , in which pity mingled with shame and regret . He wandered out into the silent night , and soon was leaning on the gate of Albion Villa , gazing wistfully at the windows , and sore perplexed and nobly wretched . As he was going out , Mr. Hardie raised his eyebrows with a look of disinterested wonder and curiosity ; and touched his forehead to Jane , as much as to say , “
135888	136321	135882	135882	he	4434	” As soon as they were alone , he asked her coolly what Alfred meant . She said she had no idea . Then he examined her keenly about this fourteen thousand pounds , and found , to his relief , Alfred had never even mentioned it to her . And now Richard Hardie , like his son , wanted to be alone , and think over this new peril that had risen in the bosom of his own family , and , for once , the company of his favourite child was irksome : he made an excuse and strolled out in his turn into the silent night . It was calm and clear : the thousand holy eyes , under which men prefer to do their crimes — except when they are in too great a hurry to wait — looked down and seemed to wonder anything can be so silly as to sin ; and beneath their pure gaze the man of the world pondered with all his soul . He tormented himself with conjectures : through what channel did Alfred suspect him ? Through the Dodds ? Were they aware of their loss ? Had the pocket - book spoken ? If so , why had not Mrs. Dodd or her son attacked him ? But then perhaps Alfred was their agent : they wished to try a friendly remonstrance through a mutual friend before proceeding to extremities ; this accorded with Mrs. Dodd 's character as he remembered her . The solution was reasonable ; but he was relieved of it by recollecting what Alfred had said , that he had not entered the house since the bank broke . On this he began to hope Alfred 's might be a mere suspicion he could not establish by any proof ; and at all events , he would lock it in his own breast like a good son : his never having given a hint even to his sister favoured this supposition . Thus meditating , Mr. Hardie found himself at the gate of Albion Villa . Yet he had strolled out with no particular intention of going there . Had his mind , apprehensive of danger from that quarter , driven his body thither ? He took a look at the house , and the first thing he saw was a young lady leaning over the balcony , and murmuring softly to a male figure below , whose outline Mr. Hardie could hardly discern , for it stood in the shadow . Mr. Hardie was delighted . “
136327	136331	136324	136325	Miss Juliet	657	” said he , “
136354	136444	136344	136344	You	657	” He then withdrew softly from the gate , not to disturb the intrigue , and watched a few yards off ; determined to see who Julia 's nightly visitor was , and give Alfred surprise for surprise . He had not long to wait : the man came away directly , and walked , head erect , past Mr. Hardie , and glanced full in his face , but did not vouchsafe him a word . It was Alfred himself . Mr. Hardie was profoundly alarmed and indignant . “
136484	136623	136624	136624	Sampson	357	” And now he suspected female cunning and malice in the way that thunderbolt had been quietly prepared for him and launched , without warning , in his very daughter 's presence , and the result just communicated to Julia Dodd . In a very gloomy mood he followed his son , and heard his firm though elastic tread on the frosty ground , and saw how loftily he carried his head ; and from that moment feared , and very , very nearly hated him . The next day he feigned sick and sent for Osmond . That worthy prescribed a pill and a draught , the former laxative , the latter astringent . This ceremony performed , Mr. Hardie gossipped with him ; and , after a detour or two , glided to his real anxiety . “
136656	136657	136639	136639	he	425	” “
136665	136666	136639	136639	he	425	” “
136677	136705	136753	136753	Sampson	357	” Mr. Osmond replied that apoplexy was often idiopathic . Captain Dodd , as he understood , had fallen down in the street in a sudden fit : “
136729	136746	136639	136639	he	425	” The birth of Topsy was idiopathic — in that learned lady 's opinion . — — “
136764	136805	136753	136753	Sampson	357	” Osmond was amused at this , and repeated that the mania came of not being bled enough . The discussion was turned into an unexpected quarter by the entrance of Jane Hardie , who came timidly in and said , “
136838	136839	136827	136827	He	312	” “
136844	136849	136827	136827	He	312	” said Mr. Hardie ; “
136862	136893	136827	136827	He	312	” But she persisted gently that there was more in it than that ; and his headaches were worse , and she could not be easy any longer without advice . “
136899	136904	136827	136827	He	312	” said Mr. Osmond , “
136955	136956	136943	136943	he	312	” “
136975	136976	136960	136960	I	0	” “
136987	136988	136960	136960	I	0	” “
136997	137038	136990	136990	you	0	” This proposal did not at all suit Mr. Hardie . He put his own construction on Alfred 's pallor and dejection , and was uneasy at the idea of his being cross - questioned by a couple of doctors : “
137043	137047	136990	136990	you	0	” said he ; “
137070	137071	137058	137059	you gentlemen	4444	” “
137081	137086	137087	137087	My	0	” said Osmond keenly . “
137117	137296	137297	137297	My	0	” Jane looked so imploringly that Mr. Hardie yielded a reluctant assent , on those terms . So the next day , by appointment , Mr. Osmond introduced his friend Dr. Wycherley : bland and bald with a fine bead , and a face naturally intelligent , but crossed every now and then by gleams of vacancy ; a man of large reading , and of tact to make it subserve his interests . A voluminous writer on certain medical subjects , he had so saturated himself with circumlocution , that it distilled from his very tongue : he talked like an Article , a Quarterly one ; and so gained two advantages : 1st , he rarely irritated a fellow - creature ; for if he began a sentence hot , what with its length , and what with its windiness , he ended it cool : item , stabs by polysyllables are pricks by sponges . 2ndly , this foible earned him the admiration of fools ; and that is as invaluable as they are innumerable . “
137476	137477	137480	137480	you	1075	” “
137483	137487	137480	137480	you	1075	” said Osmond , “
137515	137524	137525	137526	Miss Hardie	277	” Jane inquired timidly what that conclusion was . “
137546	137553	137525	137526	Miss Hardie	277	” Dr. Wycherley ended the sentence : “
137576	137599	137600	137600	Gentleman	9094	” Jane looked awestruck at their solemnity ; but Mr. Hardie , who was taking advice against the grain , turned satirical . “
137602	137606	137600	137600	Gentleman	9094	” said he , “
137640	137690	137636	137636	you	9094	” The two doctors looked at one another inquiringly , and so settled how to proceed . Dr. Wycherley explained to Mr. Hardie that there was a sort of general unreasonable and superstitious feeling abroad , a kind of terror of the complaint with which his son was threatened ; “
137712	137748	137636	137636	you	9094	” it was on this account he had learned to approach the subject with singular caution , and even with a timidity which was kinder in appearance than in reality ; that he must admit . “
137763	137772	137751	137751	you	9094	” said Mr. Hardie , with consummate indifference . “
137777	137787	137751	137751	you	9094	” said Jane , in a fever of anxiety ; “
137794	137795	137751	137751	you	9094	” “
137867	137874	137924	137924	I	0	” His unprofessional hearers only stared . “
137881	137893	137924	137924	I	0	” said Dr. Wycherley , waxing impatient at their abominable obtuseness , “
137911	137912	137924	137924	I	0	” “
137915	137920	137924	137924	I	0	” said Mr. Hardie , “
137933	137949	137924	137924	I	0	” The doctors stared in their turn at the prodigious coolness of a tender parent . “
137953	137958	137924	137924	I	0	” said Dr. Wycherley ; “
137984	138007	137968	137969	Your son	1991	” Jane uttered an exclamation of horror ; the doctor soothed her with an assurance that there was no cause for alarm . “
138010	138022	137968	137969	Your son	1991	” was of easy cure : the mischief lay in delay . “
138026	138031	137968	137969	Your son	1991	” said he paternally , “
138092	138128	138043	138043	my	0	” He went on to deplore the blind prejudice of unprofessional persons , who choose to fancy that other diseases creep , but Insanity pounces , on a man ; which he expressed thus neatly : “
138186	138227	138228	138228	His	0	” This chimera he proceeded to confute by experience : he had repeatedly been called in to cases of mania described as sudden , and almost invariably found the patient had been cranky for years ; which he condensed thus : “
138264	138298	138228	138228	His	0	” He instanced a parson , whom he had lately attended , and found him as constipated and as convinced he was John the Baptist engaged to the Princess Mary as could be . “
138301	138307	138228	138228	His	0	” continued the learned doctor , “
138408	138409	138411	138411	he	0	” “
138422	138441	138411	138411	he	0	” inquired Mr. Hardie , perking up , and exhibiting his first symptoms of interest in the discussion . “
138507	138551	138552	138552	Him	0	” The next instance he gave was of a stockbroker suffering under general paralysis and a rooted idea that all the specie in the Bank of England was his , and ministers in league with foreign governments to keep him out of it . “
138554	138559	138552	138552	Him	0	” said the doctor , “
138609	138610	138580	138580	He	0	” “
138638	138661	138612	138612	you	0	” This adroit twist of the argument rather surprised Dr. Wycherley . However , he was at no loss for a reply . “
138707	138714	138718	138718	sir	1075	” he concluded with some severity . “
138733	138826	138726	138726	I	0	” The parent , whose levity and cold reception of good tidings he had thus mildly , yet with due dignity , rebuked , was a man of the world , and liked to make friends , not enemies : so he took the hint , and made a very civil speech , assuring Dr. Wycherley that , if he ventured to differ from him , he was none the less obliged by the kind interest he took in a comparative stranger : and would be very glad to hear all about the “
138831	138839	138726	138726	I	0	” Dr. Wycherley bowed slightly and complied : “
138880	138884	138885	138885	He	4476	” Jane sighed . “
138890	138891	138885	138885	He	4476	” “
138946	138947	138948	138948	Papa	426	” “
138950	138954	138948	138948	Papa	426	” said Jane , “
138972	138973	138963	138963	him	312	” “
138979	138984	138963	138963	him	312	” said Dr. Wycherley ; “
139043	139068	139017	139018	The patient	1315	” Jane clasped her hands and the tears stood in her eyes ; so well did this description tally with poor Alfred 's case . “
139074	139079	139017	139018	The patient	1315	” continued Dr. Wycherley , “
139342	139413	139461	139461	doctor	8892	” Jane asked leave to note these all down in her note - book . Mr. Hardie assented adroitly ; for he was thinking whether he could not sift some grain out of all this chaff . Should Alfred blab his suspicions , here were two gentlemen who would at all events help him to throw ridicule on them . Dr. Wycherley having politely aided Jane Hardie to note down the “
139425	139428	139461	139461	doctor	8892	” resumed : “
139455	139456	139447	139447	he	1991	” “
139463	139467	139461	139461	doctor	8892	” said Jane , “
139489	139490	139541	139541	he	1991	” “
139516	139517	139514	139514	he	1991	” “
139524	139529	139514	139514	he	1991	” said Mr. Hardie . “
139534	139538	139541	139541	he	1991	” objected Jane , “
139559	139567	139541	139541	he	1991	” Mr. Hardie 's blood ran cold . “
139570	139574	139541	139541	he	1991	” he stammered , “
139580	139581	139586	139586	he	1991	” “
139614	139631	139610	139610	you	0	” She put her finger to her forehead , and the doctors interchanged a meaning glance . “
139640	139653	139654	139654	he	1991	” said Mr. Hardie , taking the cue so unexpectedly offered him : “
139708	139717	139706	139706	Alfred	312	” When she was gone , he said , “
139734	139735	139706	139706	Alfred	312	” “
139748	139753	139706	139706	Alfred	312	” said Dr. Wycherley . “
139827	139847	139789	139789	I	0	” The doctors exchanged a meaning look . They then dissuaded him earnestly from the idea of Continental travel . “
139857	139887	139789	139789	I	0	” said Wycherley , and Osmond explained that Alfred would brood abroad as well as at home , if he went alone ; and Dr. Wycherley summed up thus : “
139922	139958	139789	139789	I	0	” Mr. Hardie did not at first see the exact purport of this oleaginous periphrasis . Presently he caught a glimpse ; but said he thought confinement was hardly the thing to drive away melancholy . “
139964	139969	139789	139789	I	0	” replied Dr. Wycherley ; “
140071	140124	140023	140062	a Psycho - physical physician , who knows the Psychosomatic relation of body and mind , and can apply physical remedies , of the effect of which on the physical instrument of intelligence , the grey matter of the brain	4496	” The good doctor then feelingly deplored the inhumanity of parents and guardians in declining to subject their incubators to opportune and salutary restraint under the more than parental care of a Psychosomatic physician . On this head he got quite warm , and inveighed against the abominable cruelty of the thing . “
140129	140133	140023	140062	a Psycho - physical physician , who knows the Psychosomatic relation of body and mind , and can apply physical remedies , of the effect of which on the physical instrument of intelligence , the grey matter of the brain	4496	” said he , “
140200	140228	140241	140241	We	4497	” Mr. Hardie was puzzled by this sentence , in which the speaker 's usual method was reversed , and the thought was bigger than the words . “
140231	140237	140241	140241	We	4497	” said he at last , “
140254	140255	140241	140241	We	4497	” “
140267	140273	140241	140241	We	4497	” said Mr. Osmond staring . “
140283	140284	140277	140279	my good friend	1473	” “
140366	140417	140446	140446	he	1315	” But ere the mellifluous pleonast had done oiling his paradox with fresh polysyllables , to make it slip into the banker 's narrow understanding , he met with a curious interruption . Jane Hardie fluttered in to say a man was at the door accusing himself of being deranged . “
140426	140431	140446	140446	he	1315	” said Osmond philosophically . “
140462	140463	140446	140446	he	1315	” “
140472	140477	140468	140470	a sensible man	4510	” said Dr. Wycherley . “
140482	140487	140468	140470	a sensible man	4510	” objected Mr. Hardie , “
140505	140506	140509	140509	they	4513	” “
140516	140521	140509	140509	they	4513	” observed Mr. Osmond . “
140525	140555	140509	140509	they	4513	” said Dr. Wycherley , warmly . And he showed a desire to examine this paragon , who had the sense to know he was out of his senses . “
140566	140570	140562	140562	you	4508	” said Jane ; “
140576	140598	140573	140574	poor man	10453	” She added , he did not like to come in , and would they mind just going out to him ? “
140615	140845	140609	140609	you	4508	” And they all three rose and went out together , and found the petitioner at the front door . Who should it be but James Maxley ! His beard was unshaven , his face haggard , and everything about him showed a man broken in spirit as well as fortune : even his voice had lost half its vigour , and , whenever he had uttered a consecutive sentence or two , his head dropped on his breast pitiably : indeed , this sometimes occurred in the middle of a sentence , and then the rest of it died on his lips . Mr. Richard Hardie was not prepared to encounter one of his unhappy creditors thus publicly , and , to shorten the annoyance , would have dismissed him roughly : but he dared not ; for Maxley was no longer alone nor unfriended . When Jane left him to intercede for him , a young man joined him , and was now comforting him with kind words , and trying to get him to smoke a cigar ; and this good - hearted young gentleman was the banker 's son in the flesh , and his opposite in spirit , Mr. Alfred Hardie . Finding these two in contact , the Doctors interchanged demurest glances . Mr. Hardie asked Maxley sullenly what he wanted of them . “
140850	140855	140848	140848	sir	1075	” said Maxley despondingly , “
140910	140920	140937	140938	the magistrates	4253	” And down went his head on his chest . “
140923	140930	140937	140938	the magistrates	4253	” said Mr. Hardie , peevishly : “
140944	140956	140937	140938	the magistrates	4253	” Maxley looked up , and seemed to recover the thread : “
140998	141006	140989	140989	they	4253	” And down went his head again . “
141011	141016	140989	140989	they	4253	” said Mr. Hardie , “
141029	141030	141017	141017	you	0	” “
141077	141148	141153	141153	sir	1075	” There was no malice in this ; it was a plain broken - hearted man 's notion of give and take ; but it was a home - thrust all the same ; and Mr. Hardie was visibly discountenanced , and Alfred more so . Mr. Osmond , to relieve a situation so painful , asked Maxley rather hastily what were the curious things he saw . Maxley shuddered . “
141293	141312	141283	141283	I	0	” He sighed , then , after a moment 's pause , lowered his voice to a whisper : “
141389	141390	141374	141374	I	0	” “
141395	141400	141374	141374	I	0	” said Mr. Hardie , “
141411	141412	141401	141401	I	0	” “
141421	141422	141423	141423	I	0	” “
141429	141434	141423	141423	I	0	” said the magistrate : “

141572	141578	141560	141560	I	0	” And his head dropped . “
141587	141592	141582	141582	Maxley	604	” said Alfred sarcastically , “
141649	141662	141665	141665	they	4548	” Dr. Wycherley admired Alfred for this , and whispered Mr. Osmond , “
141668	141728	141665	141665	they	4548	” Mr. Hardie did not deign to answer his son , who indeed had spoken at him , and not to him . As for poor Maxley , he was in sad and sober earnest , and could not relish nor even take in Alfred 's irony . He lifted his head and looked Mr. Hardie in the face . “
141735	141743	141731	141733	a hard man	4549	” said he , trembling with emotion . “
141849	141922	141837	141837	you	604	” With this he went into a rage , took a packet out of his pocket , and flung 900l . of Mr. Hardie 's paper at Mr. Hardie 's head before any one could stop him . But Alfred saw his game , stepped forward , and caught it with one hand , and with the dexterity of a wicket - keeper , within a foot of his father 's nose . “
141929	141939	141837	141837	you	604	” said he : then , a little sternly , “
141964	141978	141979	141979	I	0	” He then put the notes in his pocket , and said quietly , “
141992	141993	141979	141979	I	0	” “
142007	142026	142004	142004	I	0	” remonstrated his father . But he made no reply : they very seldom answered one another now . “
142029	142041	142004	142004	I	0	” said Dr. Wycherley , inspecting him like a human curiosity , “
142049	142050	142004	142004	I	0	” “
142057	142089	142004	142004	I	0	” retorted Alfred in a moment and met his offensive gaze with a point - blank look of supercilious disdain . Then having shut him up , he turned to Osmond : “
142092	142096	142110	142110	Routine	661	” said he , “
142149	142150	142152	142152	I	0	” “
142158	142220	142155	142156	Mr. Alfred	312	” said Osmond heartily : and wrote a prescription on a leaf of his memorandum - book , remarking that though a simple purgative , it had made short work of a great many serpents and dragons , and not a few spectres and hobgoblins into the bargain . The young gentleman thanked him graciously , and said kindly to Maxley , “
142245	142288	142235	142235	somebody	9025	” The poor man took the guinea , and the prescription , and his head drooped again , and he slouched away . Dr. Wycherley remarked significantly that his conduct was worth imitating by all persons similarly situated : and concluded oracularly : “
142295	142296	142235	142235	somebody	9025	” “
142312	142335	142336	142336	I	0	” With this parting blow the Oxonian suddenly sauntered away , unconscious , it seemed , of the existence of his companions . “
142345	142355	142356	142356	Maxley	381	” remarked Dr. Wycherley with vast benevolence of manner . “
142359	142360	142336	142336	I	0	” “
142393	142402	142387	142387	his	381	” Mr. Hardie replied with some little hesitation , “
142423	142424	142412	142412	he	381	” “
142428	142433	142434	142434	they	4559	” replied Dr. Wycherley : “
142524	142525	142528	142528	dear	1054	” “
142544	142548	142541	142542	a madman	10772	” inquired Jane . “
142556	142557	142541	142542	a madman	10772	” “
142572	142589	142561	142562	the doctor	8653	” remarked Mr. Hardie . Dr. Wycherley assented , and made a remarkable statement in confirmation : “
142619	142657	142561	142562	the doctor	8653	” He then put on his gloves , and , with much kindness but solemnity , warned Mr. Hardie not to neglect his son 's case , nor to suppose that matters could go on like this without “
142670	142674	142561	142562	the doctor	8653	” said he , “
143004	143005	143009	143009	sir	1075	” “
143024	143029	143031	143031	their	4579	” The Psycho - cerebrals “
143033	143039	143031	143031	their	4579	” ( Psycho - cerebral for “
143042	143065	143031	143031	their	4579	” ) , and left Jane Hardie brimful of anxiety . Alfred was not there to dispose of the tirade in two words “
143069	143176	143031	143031	their	4579	” and so smoke on ; and , not being an university woman , she could not keep her eye on the original assumption while following the series of inferences the learned doctor built so neatly , story by story , on the foundation of the quicksand of a loose conjecture . So poor Argan , when Fleurant enumerates the consequences of his omitting a single — dose shall I say?—is terrified by the threatened disorders , which succeed to each other logically enough : all the absurdity being in the first link of the chain ; and from that his mind is diverted . — — “
143186	143191	143184	143184	Alfred	312	” said Mr. Hardie . “
143206	143207	143192	143192	I	0	” “
143226	143232	143211	143211	papa	1059	” Mr. Hardie smiled sarcastically . “
143252	143263	143264	143264	My	0	” Then , after a while , he said parentally , “
143447	143448	143435	143435	you	4594	” “
143455	143456	143457	143457	Somehow	665	” “
143471	143472	143465	143465	he	4590	” “
143486	143487	143473	143473	He	4590	” “
143498	143499	143495	143495	I	0	” “
143538	143539	143542	143543	little angel	4599	” “
143568	143698	143699	143699	I	0	” Thus appealed to , Jane promised warmly : and the man of the world , finding he had a blind and willing instrument in the one creature he loved , kissed her on the forehead , and told her to run away , for here was Mr. Skinner , who no doubt wanted to speak on business . Skinner , who had in fact been holding respectfully aloof for some time , came forward on Jane 's retiring , and in a very obsequious tone requested a private interview . Mr. Hardie led the way into the little dining - room . They were no sooner alone than Skinner left off fawning , very abruptly ; and put on a rugged resolute manner that was new to him : “
143706	143717	143699	143699	I	0	” said he sturdily . Mr. Hardie looked an inquiry . “
143731	143739	143725	143725	I	0	” said the little clerk almost brutally : “
143808	143822	143827	143827	Skinner	430	” The little wretch raised his voice louder and louder at every sentence . “
143829	143835	143827	143827	Skinner	430	” said Mr. Hardie anxiously , “
143865	143866	143852	143852	I	0	” “
143960	143961	143948	143948	I	0	” “
143966	143967	143948	143948	I	0	” “
143973	143977	143948	143948	I	0	” shrieked Skinner . “
144049	144050	144042	144043	a thief	10518	” “
144060	144061	144052	144052	I	0	” “
144100	144120	144094	144094	his	666	” With this he ran to the window and threw it open . Hardie entreated him to be calm . “
144129	144133	144127	144127	Skinner	430	” said he , “
144165	144166	144162	144163	my enemy	9210	” “
144272	144324	144326	144326	you	430	” Mr. Hardie groaned aloud , but there was no help for it . Skinner was on sale : and must be bought . He took out two notes for five hundred pounds each , and laid them on the table , after taking their numbers . Skinner 's eyes glistened : “
144330	144346	144326	144326	you	430	” said he . He put them in his pocket . Then he said quietly , “
144386	144387	144382	144382	I	0	” “
144402	144403	144375	144377	a deep one	4618	” “
144445	144446	144449	144449	my	0	” “
144461	144505	144453	144453	your	1075	” It was Skinner 's turn to hesitate . After reflecting , however , on all the possible consequences , he saw nothing to fear ; so he consented . The business completed , a magic change took place in the little clerk . “
144537	144538	144531	144531	he	312	” “
144544	144554	144541	144541	you	0	” inquired Mr. Hardie with ill - disguised anxiety . “
144976	145000	144964	144964	I	0	” This intelligence discomposed Mr. Hardie terribly ; it did away with all hope that Alfred meant to keep his suspicions to himself . “
145010	145026	145003	145003	you	0	” said he reproachfully . Skinner 's sharp visage seemed to sharpen as he replied , “
145035	145036	145028	145028	I	0	” “
145042	145046	145038	145038	your	0	” Skinner laughed . “
145105	145120	145092	145093	Mr. Something	667	” And he whipped out , leaving his master filled with rage and dismay . “
145128	145247	145124	145126	this little wretch	4632	” He was now accountable for fourteen thousand pounds , and had only thirteen thousand left , if forced to reimburse ; so that it was quite on the cards for him to lose a thousand pounds by robbing his neighbour and risking his own immortal jewel . This galled him to the quick ; and altogether his equable temper began to give way ; it had already survived half the iron of his nerves . He walked up and down the parlour chafing like an irritated lion . In which state of his mind the one enemy he now feared and hated walked quietly into the room , and begged for a little serious conversation with him . “
145254	145259	145251	145251	your	4633	” said Mr. Hardie : “
145274	145275	145268	145269	your father	1960	” “
145287	145348	145349	145349	You	0	” replied Alfred , looking him in the face point - blank . At this swift rejoinder , Mr. Hardie felt like a too confident swordsman , who , attacking in a passion suddenly receives a prick that shows him his antagonist is not one to be trifled with . He was on his guard directly , and said coldly , “
145359	145360	145349	145349	You	0	” “
145379	145403	145369	145369	I	0	” Mr. Hardie reflected on what Skinner had told him , and found he had made another false move . He tried again : “
145409	145415	145406	145407	the Dodds	398	” with an incredulous sneer . “
145421	145426	145418	145419	the Dodds	398	” replied Alfred calmly . “
145435	145436	145444	145444	her	255	” “
145458	145459	145450	145450	I	0	” “
145465	145471	145450	145450	I	0	” inquired Mr. Hardie innocently . “
145477	145498	145516	145516	him	425	” repeated the young man disdainfully . Then suddenly turning on his father , with red brow and flashing eyes : “
145590	145614	145566	145566	you	1075	” Mr. Hardie turned pale , and almost sick : with these words of Alfred 's fled all hope of ever deceiving him . “
145619	145634	145566	145566	you	1075	” said the young man , lowering his voice from rage to profound sorrow : “
145787	145788	145778	145778	she	255	” “
145791	145796	145797	145797	he	430	” thought Mr. Hardie , “
145810	145839	145840	145840	You	1075	” He then took a line well known to artful men : he encouraged Alfred to show his hand ; maintaining a complete reserve as to his own ; “
145874	145875	145876	145876	I	0	” “
146078	146114	146070	146070	you	0	” Mr. Hardie coloured , but did not reply . He had passed from the irritable into the quietly vindictive stage . Alfred then deprecated further discussion of what was past , and said abruptly , “
146258	146379	146383	146383	me	0	” Now this offer was no sooner made than Mr. Hardie shut his face , and went to mental arithmetic , like one doing a sum behind a thick door . He would have taken ten thousand : but five thousand did not much tempt him : besides , would it be five thousand clear ? He already owed Alfred two thousand five hundred . It flashed through him that a young man who loathed and despised Injustice — even to himself — would not consent to be diddled by him out of one sum while making him a present of another : and then there was Skinner 's thousand to be reimbursed . He therefore declined in these terms : “
146507	146534	146502	146502	I	0	” Alfred replied that foreign travel was his dream : but he could not leave Barkington while there was an act of justice to be done . “
146542	146555	146540	146540	boy	4668	” said Mr. Hardie , with wonderful dignity , all things considered . “
146737	146798	146802	146802	you	4674	” He hid his face , to conceal its incongruous expression : and heaved a deep sigh . Alfred turned his head away and groaned . After a while he rose from his seat and went to the door ; but seemed reluctant to go : he cast a longing , lingering look on his father , and said beseechingly : “
146837	146850	146851	146851	Your	4674	” Then he suddenly turned and threw himself impetuously on his knees : “
146976	146977	146978	146978	You	4674	” “
146982	146997	146978	146978	You	4674	” cried the father , stung with remorse , but not touched with penitence . “
147030	147031	147019	147019	I	0	” “
147034	147047	147054	147054	you	4674	” said Alfred , rising and turning suddenly calm as a statue : “
147073	147106	147068	147069	my father	1958	” And he walked gently out of the room , and , as he passed the window Mr. Hardie heard his great heart sob . He wiped his forehead with his handkerchief . “
147111	147115	147068	147069	my father	1958	” thought he , “
147158	147230	147231	147231	Papa	426	” At dinner there was no Alfred ; but after dinner a note to Jane informing her he had taken lodgings in the town , and requesting her to send his books and clothes in the evening . Jane handed the note to her father : and sighed deeply . Watching his face as he read it , she saw him turn rather pale , and look more furrowed than ever . “
147233	147237	147231	147231	Papa	426	” said she , “
147244	147245	147246	147246	I	0	” “
147250	147265	147246	147246	I	0	” Then , after a long pause , he ground his teeth and said , “
147279	147311	147246	147246	I	0	” LONG before this open rupture Jane Hardie had asked her father sorrowfully , whether she was to discontinue her intimacy with the Dodds : she thought of course he would say “
147314	147372	147246	147246	I	0	” and it cost her a hard struggle between inclination and filial duty to raise the question . But Mr. Hardie was anxious her friendship with that family should continue ; it furnished a channel of news , and in case of detection might be useful to avert or soften hostilities ; so he answered rather sharply , “
147395	147498	147499	147501	a young man”—or	10906	” Jane coloured with pleasure at this most unexpected reply ; but her wakeful conscience reminded her , this answer was given in ignorance of her attachment to Edward Dodd , and urged her to confession . But at that Nature recoiled : Edward had not openly declared his love to her ; so modest pride , as well as modest shame , combined with female cowardice to hold back the avowal . So then Miss Tender Conscience tormented herself ; and recorded the struggle in her diary ; but briefly , and in terms vague and typical ; not a word about “
147501	147502	147246	147246	I	0	man”—or “
147505	147521	147499	147501	a young man”—or	10906	love”—but one obscure and hasty slap at the carnal affections , and a good deal about “
147527	147529	147499	147501	a young man”—or	10906	” and “
147535	147622	147499	147501	a young man”—or	10906	” Yet , to do her justice , laxity of expression did not act upon her conduct and warp that as it does most mystical speakers . To obey her father to the letter , she maintained a friendly correspondence with Julia Dodd , exchanging letters daily ; but , not to disobey him in the spirit , she ceased to visit Albion Villa . Thus she avoided Edward , and extracted from the situation the utmost self - denial , and the least possible amount of “
147626	147693	147499	147501	a young man”—or	10906	” as she naively denominated an interchange of worldly affection , however distant and respectful . One day she happened to mention her diary , and say it was a present comfort to her , and instructive to review . Julia , catching at every straw of consolation , said she would keep one too , and asked a sight of Jane 's for a model . “
147699	147703	147708	147708	one	8375	” said Jane : “
147714	147873	147708	147708	one	8375	” This was fortunate : it precluded that servile imitation , in which her sex excels even mine ; and consequently the two records reflect two good girls , instead of one in two skins ; and may be trusted to conduct this narrative forward , and relieve its monotony a little : only , of course , the reader must not expect to see the plot of a story carried minutely out in two crude compositions written with an object so distinct : he must watch for glimpses and make the most of indications . Nor is this an excessive demand upon his intelligence ; for , if he can not do this with a book , how will he do it in real life , where male and female characters reveal their true selves by glimpses only , and the gravest and most dramatic events give the diviner so few and faint signs of their coming ? “
147925	147979	147922	147923	poor mamma	1632	“ 8 P. M. In the midst of our affliction Heaven sent us a ray of comfort : the kindest letter from a lady , a perfect stranger . It came yesterday ; but now I have got it to copy : oh , bless it ; and the good , kind writer . ”
147980	148214	148217	148224	the ruffian , who succeeded our good captain	4700	“ ' DEAR MADAM,—I scarcely know whether to hope or to fear that your good husband may have mentioned my name to you : however , he is just the man to pass over both my misbehaviour and his own gallantry ; so I beg permission to introduce myself . I and my little boy were passengers by the Agra ; I was spoiled by a long residence in India , and gave your husband sore trouble by resisting discipline , refusing to put out my light at nine o'clock , and in short by being an unreasonable woman , or rather a spoiled child . Well , all my little attempts at a feud failed ; Captain Dodd did his duty , and kept his temper provokingly ; the only revenge he took was a noble one ; he jumped into the sea after my darling Freddy , and saved him from a watery grave , and his mother from madness or death ; yet he was himself hardly recovered from a wound he had received in defending us all against pirates . Need I say more to one who is herself a mother ? You will know how our little misunderstanding ended after that . As soon as we were friends I made him talk of his family ; yourself , Edward , Julia , I seem to know you all . “
148370	148471	148354	148355	the society	4707	“ ' You will be surprised , dear madam , at all this from a stranger to yourself , and will perhaps set it down to a wish to intrude on your acquaintance . Well , then , dear madam , you will not be far wrong . I should like much to know one , whose character I already seem acquainted with ; and to convey personally my gratitude and admiration of your husband : I could pour it out more freely to you , you know , than to him.—I am , dear Madam , Yours very faithfully , “
148499	148520	148521	148521	We	4709	“ Oh , shall I ever be old enough and hard enough to speak of this without stopping to cry ? “

I almost wish I could think it was coldness or diminished affection ; for I fear something worse ; something to make him wretched . Those dreadful words papa spoke before he was afflicted ! words I will never put on paper ; but they ring in my ears still ; they appal me : and then found at their very door ! Ah ! and I knew I should find him near that house . And now he keeps away . ”
148928	148948	148787	148788	an egotist	8478	“ Dec. 9th.—All day trying to comfort mamma . She made a great effort and wrote to Mrs. Beresford . ”

My poor husband is very ill ; so ill that he no longer remembers the past , neither the brave acts that have won him your esteem , nor even the face of his loving and unhappy wife , who now thanks you with many tears for your sweet letter .

She was never so good to him before : she said , ' My dear child , you have my pity and my esteem ; alas ! that at your age you should be tried like this .

' Look here , Hardie , ' said he , ' if anybody but you had told us about this fourteen thousand pounds , I should have set the police on your governor before now .

Then he went on : ' Of all blunders , the worst is to fall between two stools . Look here , mamma : we decide , for the son 's sake , not to attack the father : after that it would be very inconsistent to turn the cold shoulder to the son . Another thing , who suffers most by this fraud ? Why the man that marries Julia . ' Alfred burst out impetuously , ' Oh , prove that to me , and let me be that sufferer . ' Edward turned calmly to mamma : ' If the fourteen thousand pounds was in our hands , what should you do with it ? ' “
154792	154825	154826	154826	Alfred	312	“ ' There , ' said Edward , ' you see it is you who lose by your governor's — I wo n't say what — if you marry my sister . ' “
154844	154946	154826	154826	Alfred	312	“ Then Edward turned to mamma and me ; and said , ' This poor fellow has left his father 's house because he wronged us : then this house ought to open its arms to him : that is only justice . But now to be just to our side ; I have been to Mr. Crawford , the lawyer , and I find this Hardie junior has ten thousand pounds of his own .

159402	159431	159377	159378	a Christian	4950	“ She replied , 3 P. M. , that her mother approved the marriage , and she owed no obedience , nor affection either , to my parent . “
159444	159468	159377	159378	a Christian	4950	“ At 5 received a note from Mrs. Dodd proposing that the correspondence between myself and her daughter should cease for the present . “
159529	159649	160028	160028	he	312	“ In the evening Alfred came in looking very red , and asked me whether it was not self - reliant and uncharitable of me to condemn so many estimable persons , all better acquainted with the circumstances than I am . I replied with the fifth commandment . He bit his lip and said , ' We had better not meet again , until you have found out which is worthiest of honour , your father or your brother . ' And with this he left abruptly ; and something tells me I shall not see him again . My faithfulness has wounded him to the quick . Alas ! Prayed for him and cried myself to sleep . ”
159650	160016	160028	160028	he	312	“ April 4th . Met him disguised as a common workman , and carrying a sack full of things . I was so shocked I could not maintain my resolution : I said , ' Oh , Mr. Edward , what are you doing ? ' He blushed a little , but told me he was going to sell some candlesticks and things of his making : and he should get a better price in that dress ; all traders looked on a gentleman as a thing made to be pillaged . Then he told me he was going to turn them into a bonnet and a wreath ; and his beautiful brown eyes sparkled with affection . What egotistical creatures they must be ! I was quite overcome , and said , Oh why did he refuse our offer ? Did he hate me so very much that he would not even take his due from my hand ? ' No , ' he said , ' nobody in our house is so unjust to you as to hate you ; my sister honours you , and is very sorry you think ill of her : and , as for me , I love you ; you know how I love you . ' I hid my face in my hands ; and sobbed out , ' Oh , you must not ; you must not ; my poor father has one disobedient child already . ' He said softly , ' Do n't cry , dear one ; have a little patience ; perhaps the clouds will clear : and , meantime , why think so ill of us ? Consider , we are four in number , of different dispositious , yet all of one mind about Julia marrying Alfred . May we not be right ; may we not know something we love you too well to tell you ? ' His words and his rich manly voice were so soothing ; I gave him just one hand while I still hid my burning face with the other ; he kissed the hand I yielded him , and left me abruptly . “
160036	160037	160028	160028	he	312	” “
160056	160066	160067	160067	Papa	426	“ Made no reply . What could I say ? “
160134	160165	160128	160132	one who meditated a crime	4955	” THE spirit of dissension in Musgrove Cottage penetrated to the very kitchen . Old Betty sided with Alfred , and combated in her place the creed of the parlour : “
160333	160340	160311	160311	man	8747	” She said , too , that “
160349	160423	160311	160311	man	8747	” and she constantly invited Peggy to speak up , and gainsay her . But Peggy was a young woman with white eyelashes , and given to looking down , and not to speaking up : she was always watching Mr. Hardie in company , like a cat cream ; and hovering about him when alone . Betty went so far as to accuse her of colloguing with him against Alfred , and of “
160430	160650	160311	160311	man	8747	” which accusation elicited no direct reply , but stinging innuendoes hours after . Now , if one looks into the thing , the elements of discord had attacked Albion Villa quite as powerfully as Musgrove Cottage ; but had hitherto failed signally : the mutual affection of the Dodds was so complete , and no unprincipled person among them to split the good . And , now that the wedding drew near , there was but one joyful heart within the walls , though the others were too kind and unselfish to throw cold water . Mrs. Dodd 's own wedding had ended in a piteous separation , and now to part with her darling child and launch her on the uncertain waves of matrimony ! She heaved many a sigh when alone : but as there were no bounds to her maternal love , so there were no exceptions to her politeness : over her aching heart she forced on a wedding face , subdued , but hopeful , for her daughter , as she would for any other young lady about to be married beneath her roof . It wanted but six days , when one morning after breakfast the bereaved wife , and mother about to be deserted , addressed her son and Viceroy thus : “
160659	160660	160651	160651	Edward	254	” “
160671	160672	160311	160311	man	8747	” “
160679	160685	160675	160675	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd stoutly . “
160699	160700	160675	160675	I	0	” “
160711	160712	160675	160675	I	0	” “
160724	160737	160718	160718	I	0	” said Julia reproachfully . Edward shook his head , and said , “
160748	160756	160758	160759	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ But she is not a he , ”
160767	160786	160758	160759	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ and who ever heard of a young lady being married without some things to be married in ? ”
160787	160829	160764	160765	a schoolman	4975	“ Well , I 've heard Nudity is not the cheese on public occasions : but why not go dressed like a lady as she always does , only with white gloves ; and be married without any bother and nonsense . ”
160830	160837	160839	160840	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ You talk like a boy , ”
160842	160853	160855	160855	she	253	“ I could not bear it . My poor child ! ”
160867	160879	160881	160881	Edward	254	“ Well , suppose we make the poor child the judge , ”
160913	160922	160924	160925	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ It was not fair to ask her , ”
160946	160949	160951	160951	Edward	254	“ Ugh ! ”
160953	160971	160972	160972	Julia	255	“ This is a bad beginning . Girl 's candour ! Now for a masterpiece of duplicity . ”
161018	161112	161009	161011	The young lady	8574	“ If I was going to be married to myself , or to some gentleman I did not care for , I would not spend a shilling . But I am going to marry him ; and so — oh , Edward , think of them saying , ' What has he married ? a dowdy : why she had n't new things on to go to church with him : no bonnet , no wreath , no new white dress ! ' To mortify him the very first day of our — — ”
161147	161154	161156	161156	he	4983	“ Why you dear little goose , ”
161158	161188	161156	161156	he	4983	“ of course , I do n't mean that . I have as good as got the things we must buy ; and those are a new bonnet — — ”
161189	161192	161009	161011	The young lady	8574	“ Ah ! ”
161193	161201	161009	161011	The young lady	8574	“ A wreath of orange blossoms — — ”
161202	161208	161156	161156	he	4983	“ Oh you good boy ! ”
161209	161251	161009	161011	The young lady	8574	“ Four pair of gloves : two white — one is safe to break — two dark ; very dark : invisible green , or visible black ; last the honeymoon . All the rest you must find in the house . ”
161252	161274	161009	161011	The young lady	8574	“ What , fit her out with a parcel of old things ? so cruel , so unreasonable , dear Edward ? ”
161275	161305	161156	161156	he	4983	“ Old things ! Why , where is all your gorgeous attire from Oriental climes ? I see the splendiferous articles arrive , and then they vanish for ever . ”
161306	161323	161009	161011	The young lady	8574	“ Now , shawls and Indian muslins ! pray what use are they to a bride ? ”
161324	161336	161009	161011	The young lady	8574	“ Why , what looks nicer than a white muslin dress ? ”
161337	161349	161156	161156	he	4983	“ Married in muslin ? The very idea makes me shiver . ”
161350	161359	161009	161011	The young lady	8574	“ Well , clap her on another petticoat . ”
161360	161375	161009	161011	The young lady	8574	“ How can you be so childish ? Muslin is not the the thing . ”
161376	161384	161385	161385	He	4983	“ No more is running in debt . ”
161460	161466	161468	161470	the pertinacious wretch	4985	“ New things ? Yes , ”
161472	161679	161468	161470	the pertinacious wretch	4985	“ but they need not be new - bought things . You ladies go and confound the world 's eyes with your own in the drollest way : If Gorgeous Attire has lain long in your drawers , you fancy the world will detect on its glossy surface how long you had it , and gloated over it , and made it stale to your eye , before you could bring your mind to wear it . That is your delusion , that and the itch for going out shopping ; oh , I 'm down on you . Mamma dear , you open that gigantic wardrobe of yours ; and I 'll oil my hair , white - wash my mug ( a little moan from Mrs. D. ) and do the counterjumping business to the life ; hand the things down to you , unrol 'em , grin , charge you 100 per cent over value , note them down in a penny memorandum - book , sing out ' Caesh ! Caesh ! ' & c. & c. : and so we shall get all Julia wants , and go through the ritual of shopping without the substantial disgrace of running in debt . ”
161752	161756	161758	161758	he	254	“ All right ! ”
161760	161785	161758	161758	he	254	“ That will take a jolly time , I know ; so I 'll go to my governor first for the bonnet and wreath . ”
161837	161853	161855	161855	she	253	“ I have not the honour to know who the personage is you so describe , ”
161875	161883	161858	161858	Edward	254	“ Ah , a tradesman you patronise . ”
161884	161941	161942	161943	The lady	1031	“ Humph ! Well , yes , that is the word , mamma , haw ! haw ! I have been making the bloke a lot of oak candlesticks , and human heads with sparkling eyes , for walking - sticks , & c. And now I 'll go and draw my — protege's — blunt . ”
161960	161966	161968	161968	he	4995	“ Soyons de notre siecle , ”
162097	162126	162076	162077	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ There , that must be bleached and make you some wrappers for the honeymoon , if the weather is at all fine ; and petticoats to match ; ”
162153	162159	162161	162162	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ It was my own , ”
162165	162236	162161	162162	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ I saved it for you ; see here is your name written on it seventeen years ago . I thought ' this dear little toddler will have wings some day , and then she will leave me . ' But now I am almost afraid to let you wear it ; it might bring you misfortune : suppose after years of wedded love you should be bereaved of — — ”
162253	162259	162261	162261	she	253	“ I 'll risk it , ”
162264	162328	162261	162261	she	253	“ If it but makes me as beloved as you are , I 'll wear it , come weal come woe ! And then I shall feel it over me at the altar like my guardian angel 's wings , my own sweet , darling mamma . Oh what an idiot , what a wretch I am , to leave you at all . ”
162385	162431	162433	162433	she	253	“ This is childish of me . When I think that there are mothers who see their children go from the house corpses , not brides , I ought to be ashamed of myself . Come ! a l'oeuvre . Ah , here is something . ”
162441	162447	162449	162449	Julia	255	“ Oh , how sweet , ”
162451	162459	162449	162449	Julia	255	“ why have you never worn it ? ”
162460	162483	162487	162487	she	253	“ Dear me , child , what use would things be to those I love , if I went and wore them ? ”
162508	162603	162506	162506	herself	253	“ If I had not forgotten this , and it is the very thing . Your dear papa bought me this in London , and I remonstrated with him well for buying me such a delicate thing , only once wear . I kissed it and put it away , and forgot it . They say if you keep a thing seven years . It is just seven years since he gave it to me . Really , the dear boy is a witch : this is your wedding dress , my precious precious . ”
162637	162669	162620	162620	Sarah	281	“ Oh no , mum . This glass have got so dull ; I 'm just polishing of it a bit . I sha n't be a minute now , mum . ”
162772	162778	162780	162780	she	253	“ Well it is lovely , ”
162784	162797	162780	162780	she	253	“ but where is the one with beetle wings ? Oh here . ”
162798	162806	162808	162808	Julia	255	“ Real beetles ' wings , mamma ? ”
162810	162815	162808	162808	Julia	255	“ Yes , love . ”
162816	162882	162884	162884	she	253	“ So they are , and how wicked ! and what a lovely green ! I will never wear them : they are prismatic : now , if ever I am to be a Christian , I had better begin : everything has a beginning . Oh vanity of women , you stick at nothing . A thousand innocent lives stolen to make one dress ! ”
162907	162989	162884	162884	she	253	“ My dear , what expressions ! And you need not wear it ; indeed neither of them is fit for that purpose . But you must have a pretty thing or two about you . I have hoarded these a good many years ; now it is your turn to have them by you . And let me see ; you want a travelling cloak : but the dear boy will not let us ; so choose a warm shawl . ”
163097	163107	163108	163108	He	5001	“ May ' The British Workman ' come in ? ”
163154	163159	163161	163161	he	5001	“ Well , mother , ”
163163	163182	163161	163161	he	5001	“ you were right , and I was wrong : they are inappropriate enough , the whole lot . ”
163199	163205	163206	163206	he	5001	“ Do we want Sarah ? ”
163214	163217	163219	163220	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Inappropriate ? ”
163222	163234	163219	163220	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ There is nothing here unfit for a bride 's trousseau . ”
163235	163248	163219	163220	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Good Heavens ! Would you trick her out like a Princess ? ”
163249	163264	163219	163220	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ We must . We are too poor to dress her like a lady . ”
163265	163272	163274	163274	Julia	255	“ Cinderella ; at your service , ”
163336	163348	163350	163350	she	253	“ That was a good notion , of yours , darling , ”
163371	163382	163384	163387	the “ British Workman	11201	“ Oh , for pity 's sake , no more , ”
163385	163389	163363	163363	she	253	“ British Workman . ”
163390	163426	163384	163387	the “ British Workman	11201	“ Now , dearest , you have interfered once in feminine affairs , and we submitted . But , if you say another word , I will trim her poplin with Honiton two feet deep . ”
163427	163432	163434	163434	Edward	254	“ Quarter ! quarter ! ”
163436	163481	163434	163434	Edward	254	“ I 'm dumb ; grant me but this ; have nothing made up for her out of the house : you know there is no dressmaker in Barkington can cut like you : and then that will put some limit to our inconsistency . ”
163504	163562	163496	163496	Edward	254	“ I wish I could turn you these gowns with my lathe ; what a deal of time and bother it would save . However , if you want any stuffing , come to me ; I 'll lend you lots of shavings ; make the silk rustle . Oh , here is my governor 's contribution . ”
163570	163576	163578	163578	Julia	255	“ Now , look there , ”
163581	163607	163578	163578	Julia	255	“ it is money . And I thought you were going to bring me the very bonnet yourself . Then I should have valued it . ”
163608	163612	163614	163616	the young gentleman	1230	“ Oh yes , ”
163619	163663	163614	163616	the young gentleman	1230	“ can I choose a bonnet to satisfy such swells as you and mamma ? I 'll tell you what I 'll do ; I 'll go with you and look as wise as Solomon , all the time you are choosing it . ”
163664	163669	163671	163671	Julia	255	“ A capital plan , ”
163691	163694	163695	163695	he	254	“ Flowers , ”
163698	163725	163695	163695	he	254	“ are indispensable , at a wedding breakfast ; I hear too it is considered the right cheese to add something in the shape of grub . ”
163865	163869	163854	163854	they	5009	“ a plentiful lack ”
164489	164509	164510	164510	She	253	“ Oh , how can they be so cruel as to laugh and giggle in my David 's house ! ”
164692	164709	164687	164687	she	281	“ If they are talking free , I sha n't go in till it 's over . ”
164727	164736	164738	164738	he	312	“ You are our trustee , my boy , ”
164742	164773	164738	164738	he	312	“ so just write your name here , and mine comes here , and the witness 's there : the Doctor and Sarah will do . Send for a pen . ”
164774	164783	164687	164687	she	281	“ Let 's read it first , please . ”
164784	164791	164738	164738	he	312	“ Read it ! What for ? ”
164792	164805	164687	164687	she	281	“ Catch me signing a paper without reading it , my boy . ”
164806	164815	164817	164817	Alfred	312	“ What , ca n't you trust me ? ”
164821	164832	164817	164817	Alfred	312	“ Oh yes . And ca n't you trust me ? ”
164833	164854	164687	164687	she	281	“ There 's a question : why I have appointed you my Trusty in the Deed ; he , he . ”
164855	164872	164873	164873	Sampson	357	“ Well then trust me without my signing , and I 'll trust you without reading . ”
164924	164930	164932	164932	he	312	“ Well , read away , ”
164934	164944	164932	164932	he	312	“ one comfort , you will be no wiser . ”
164945	164953	164955	164955	Edward	254	“ What , is it in Latin ? ”
164961	165021	164955	164955	Edward	254	“ No such luck . Deeds used to be in Latin ; but Latin could not be made obscure enough . So now Dark Deeds are written in an unknown tongue called ' Lawyerish , ' where the sense is ' as one grain of wheat in two bushels of chaff , ' pick it out if you can . “
165030	165036	165026	165026	man	8747	” said Dr. Sampson stoutly . “
165059	165060	165053	165053	ye	5051	” “
165064	165068	165069	165069	I	0	” said Alfred . “
165138	165143	165136	165136	gentlemen	1264	” added he severely , “
165193	165222	165274	165274	Jane	276	” And with this he flew up - stairs on the wings of love . Julia met him in the middle of the room all in a flutter : “
165239	165270	165231	165231	I	0	” She then leaned one hand softly on his shoulder , and curving her lovely supple neck looked round into his face and watched it as she preferred her petition : “
165305	165306	165300	165300	I	0	” “
165314	165315	165316	165316	I	0	” “
165347	165354	165345	165345	Alfred	312	” said she with gentle impetuosity , “
165365	165366	165370	165370	he	1955	” “
165372	165377	165370	165370	he	1955	” said Alfred carelessly . “
165418	165419	165409	165410	your sister	1890	” “
165426	165431	165409	165410	your sister	1890	” objected Alfred ruefully . “
165479	165493	165494	165494	You	0	” He consented on these terms . Then she armed him with advice : “
165609	165610	165740	165740	I	0	” “
165616	165617	165740	165740	I	0	” “

165646	165647	165633	165633	you	0	” “
165651	165736	165737	165738	Mr. Alfred	312	” said she : and looked him earnestly in the face ; but lowered her long lashes slowly and shyly , as she realised to what her Impetuosity was pledging itself . Alfred got his hat and ran to Musgrove Cottage . A man stepped out of the shadow of a hedge opposite Albion Villa , and followed him , keeping in shadow as much as possible . The door of Musgrove Cottage was opened to him by old Betty with a joyful start ! “
165786	165845	165780	165780	Miss	5067	” She ushered him triumphantly in . Jane was seated reading : she dropped her book , and ran and kissed him with a cry of joy . So warm a reception surprised him agreeably , and simplified his task . He told her he was come to try and make it up with her before the wedding : “
165854	165858	165851	165852	dear Jenny	401	” said he , “
165885	165886	165887	165888	Dearest Alfred	312	” “
165890	165894	165896	165896	you	312	” said she , “
165951	165952	165937	165937	I	0	” “
165957	165961	165937	165937	I	0	” said Alfred , “
165968	166149	165937	165937	I	0	” At this observation the young saint laid her head on her brother 's shoulder and had a good cry like any other girl . When she recovered a little she told him , yes , she had been very unhappy : that he had always been a dear good brother to her , and the only one she had ; and that it cut her to the heart not to be at his wedding ; it seemed so unkind . Alfred set her on his knee — she had more soul than body — and kissed her and comforted her : and , in this happy revival of natural affection , his heart opened , he was off his guard , and told her all : gave her the several proofs their father had got the 14,000l .. Jane , arrested by the skill and logical clearness with which he marshalled the proofs , listened in silence ; and presently a keen shudder ran through her frame , and reminded him he was setting a daughter against her father . “
166152	166156	165937	165937	I	0	” said he , “
166278	166279	166281	166281	he	254	” “
166295	166296	166287	166287	Alfred	312	” “
166450	166479	166422	166422	He	264	” In this strain he continued till he made her blush a good deal and smile a little ; a sad smile . But at last she said , “
166565	166785	166791	166791	her	5093	” Brother and sister then kissed one another affectionately ; and Alfred ran back like the wind to Albion Cottage . Julia was not in the drawing - room , and some coolish tea was . After waiting half an hour he got impatient , and sent Sarah to say he had a message for her . Sarah went upstairs to Mrs. Dodd 's room , and was instantly absorbed . After waiting again for a long time , Alfred persuaded Edward to try his luck . Edward went up to Mrs. Dodd 's room , and was absorbed . The wedding dress was being solemnly tried on . A clean linen sheet was on the floor , and the bride stood on it , receiving the last touches of the milliner 's art . With this and her white poplin and lace veil she seemed framed in white , and her cheeks bloomed so , and her eyes beamed , with excitement and innocent vanity , that altogether she was supernaturally lovely . Once enter the room enchanted by this snow - chad rose , and — Vestigia nulla retrorsum . However , Edward escaped at last and told Alfred what was on foot , and drew a picture of the Bride with white above and white below . “
166793	166811	166789	166789	me	0	” implored the lover . Edward must ask mamma about that . He did , and mamma said “
166830	166867	166815	166820	the last person in the world	5094	” But she should come down to him in half an hour . It seemed a very long half - hour . However , by way of compensation , he was alone when she did come . “
166871	166876	166877	166877	Capital	718	” she asked eagerly . “
166894	166895	166901	166901	you	5098	” “
166911	167042	166907	166907	I	0	” And she flung a tender arm round his neck , like a young goddess making love ; and her sweet face came so near his , he had only to stoop a little , and their lips met in a long blissful kiss . That kiss was an era in her life . Innocence itself , she had put up her delicious lips to her lover in pure , though earnest affection ; but the male fire with which his met them , made her blush as well as thrill , and she drew back a little , ashamed and half scared , and nestled on his shoulder , hiding a face that grew redder and redder . He bent his graceful head , and murmured down to her , “
167051	167052	167044	167044	you	5099	” “
167092	167093	167089	167089	you	5099	” “
167118	167119	167113	167113	you	5099	” “
167137	167195	167123	167123	I	0	” A few more soft delicious murmurs , and then Julia was summoned to more rites of vanity , and the lovers parted with tender reluctance for those few hours . Alfred went home to his lodgings . He had not been there above ten minutes , when he came out hastily , and walked quickly to the “
167199	167248	167123	167123	I	0	” the principal inn in Barkington . He went into the stable - yard , and said a few words to the ostler : then returned to his lodgings . The man followed him at a distance from Albion Terrace ; watched him home ; dogged him to the “
167252	167462	167123	167123	I	0	” and , by - and - bye , entered the yard and offered the ostler a glass of ale at the tap . At Albion Villa they were working on Julia 's dresses till past midnight : and then Mrs. Dodd insisted on her going to bed . She obeyed ; but when the house was all quiet , came stealing out to her mother , and begged to sleep with her : the sad mother strained her in a tearful embrace : and so they passed the night ; clinging to one another more as the parting drew near . Edward arranged the wedding breakfast for after the ceremony ; and sent the ladies up a cup of coffee , and a bit of toast apiece . They could hardly find appetite even for this ; or indeed time ; there was so much still to do . At ten o'clock Julia was still in the height of dressing , delayed by contretemps upon contretemps . Sarah and her sister did her hair up too loose , and , being a glorious mass , it threatened all to come down and , meantime , a hair - pin quietly but persistently bored her cream - white poll . “
167469	167538	167467	167467	mamma	1053	” she cried . Mamma came half dressed , had the hair all down again , and did it up with adroit and loving hand , and put on the orange wreath , kissed her admiringly , and retired to her own toilet ; and the girls began to lace the bride 's body . Bump came Edward 's foot against the door , making them all shriek . “
167554	167583	167549	167550	Dr. Sampson	357	” The handmaids , flustered , tried to go faster ; and , when the work was done , Julia took her little handglass and inspected her back : “
167586	167590	167549	167550	Dr. Sampson	357	” she screamed , “
167601	167615	167599	167599	mamma	1053	” Mamma soon came , and the poor bride held out imploring hands , “
167631	167632	167635	167635	miss	1794	” “
167637	167641	167635	167635	miss	1794	” said Sarah , “
167652	167653	167647	167647	nobody	8583	” “
167666	167677	167635	167635	miss	1794	” Mrs. Dodd smiled superior and bade her be calm : “
167720	167734	167708	167708	I	0	” Julia 's little foot began to beat a tattoo on the floor : “
167765	167766	167761	167761	I	0	” “
167777	167778	167774	167774	our	5110	” “
167790	167791	167774	167774	our	5110	” “
167802	167811	167792	167792	Nobody	8583	” objected Mrs. Dodd . ( Bump ) ! “
167830	167831	167825	167826	the bridesmaids	5113	” “
167843	167852	167835	167835	I	0	” said Julia ; and the tattoo recommenced . “
167859	167867	167857	167857	love	1402	” said Mrs. Dodd , quietly lacing : “
167886	167906	167875	167875	Sarah	281	” Sarah returned with the reassuring tidings that the bridegroom had not yet arrived ; though the carriages had . “
167917	167921	167912	167912	he	5115	” said Julia . “
167936	168068	167931	167931	he	5115	” Under dread of a comment so significant she was ready at last , and said majestically he might come now whenever he liked . Meantime , down stairs an uneasiness of the opposite kind was growing . Ten minutes past the appointed time , and the bridegroom not there . So while Julia , now full dressed , and easy in her mind , was directing Sarah 's sister to lay out her plain travelling dress , bonnet and gloves on the bed , Mrs. Dodd was summoned downstairs . She came down with Julia 's white gloves in her hand , and a needle and thread , the button sewed on by trade 's fair hand having flown at the first strain . Edward met her on the stairs : “
168077	168084	168075	168075	mother	8332	” said he , sotto voce : “
168109	168110	168097	168097	he	5118	” “
168117	168122	168097	168097	he	5118	” said Mrs. Dodd . “
168133	168134	168124	168124	he	5118	” “
168168	168188	168191	168191	he	5118	” He ran off , and in a little more than five minutes came into the drawing - room . “
168215	168248	168210	168210	Aristotle	720	” This passed before the whole party , Julia excepted . Sampson looked at his watch , and said he could conduct the ladies to the church while Edward went for Alfred . “
168253	168258	168260	168260	mine	0	” said he gallantly , “
168265	168282	168210	168210	Aristotle	720	” Mrs. Dodd demurred to the plan . She was for waiting quietly in one place . “
168286	168290	168318	168318	I	0	” said Edward , “
168343	168379	168330	168330	I	0	” This was agreed on after some discussion . Edward , however , to provide against all contingencies , begged Sampson not to wait for him should Alfred reach the church by some other road : “
168388	168685	168380	168380	I	0	” said he . He ran off at a racing pace . The bride was then summoned , admired , and handed into one carriage with her two bridesmaids , Miss Bosanquet and Miss Darton . Sampson and Mrs. Dodd went in the other ; and by half - past eleven they were all safe in the church . A good many people , high and low , were about the door and in the pews , waiting to see the beautiful Miss Dodd married to the son of a personage once so popular as Mr. Hardie : it had even transpired that Mr. Hardie disapproved the match . They had been waiting a long time , and were beginning to wonder what was the matter , when , at last the bride 's party walked up the aisle with a bright April sun shining on them through the broad old windows . The bride 's rare beauty , and stag - like carriage of her head , imperial in its loveliness and orange wreath , drew a hum of admiration . The party stood a minute or two at the east end of the church , and then the clergyman came out and invited them into the vestry . Their reappearance was eagerly expected ; in silence at first , but presently in loud and multitudinous whispers . At this moment a young lady , with almost perfect features and sylph - like figure , modestly dressed in dove - coloured silk , but with a new chip bonnet and white gloves , entered a pew near the west door , and said a little prayer ; then proceeded up the aisle , and exchanged a word with the clerk , then into the vestry . “
168692	168735	168380	168380	I	0	” went fifty female tongues , and the arrival of the bridegroom 's sister became public news . The bride welcomed her in the vestry with a sweet guttural of surprise and delight , and they kissed one another like little tigers . “
168758	168785	168748	168748	I	0	” Now none of her own party had thought it wise to tell Julia there was any hitch : but Miss Hardie blurted out naturally enough , “
168791	168792	168789	168789	Alfred	312	” “
168800	168805	168793	168793	I	0	” said Julia innocently . “
168843	168950	168829	168829	Mamma	275	” Then , looking round at her friends ' faces , she saw in a moment that it was all wrong . Sampson 's , in particular , was burning with manly indignation , and even her mother 's discomposed , and trying to smile . When the innocent saw this , she suspected her beloved was treating her cavalierly , and her poor little mouth began to work , and she had much ado not to whimper . Mrs. Dodd , to encourage her , told her not to be put out : it had been arranged all along that Edward should go for him : “
168971	168972	168975	168975	mamma	1053	” “
168977	168981	168975	168975	mamma	1053	” said Julia ; “
168997	168998	168982	168982	Alfred	312	” “
169006	169013	169000	169000	you	5140	” asked Mrs. Dodd very gravely . “
169019	169027	169017	169017	mamma	1053	” said Julia , beginning to tremble ; “
169040	169101	169036	169036	them	5143	” The matter was terribly serious now ; indeed , it began to look hopeless . Weather overclouded : rain - drops falling ; and hard upon twelve o'clock . They all looked at one another in despair . Suddenly there was a loud , long buzzing heard outside , and the house of God turned into a gossiping fair . “
169107	169113	169036	169036	them	5143	” said Satan that day , “
169122	169123	169036	169036	them	5143	” “
169130	169163	169126	169126	they	5143	” said Mrs. Dodd . But , having thus relieved her mind , she drew herself up and prepared a freezing reception for the defaulter . A whisper reached their excited ears : “
169169	169203	169036	169036	them	5143	” and next moment Edward came into the vestry — alone : the sight of him was enough ; his brow wet with perspiration , his face black and white with bitter wrath . “
169210	169215	169207	169208	my people	5146	” he said sternly : “
169226	169254	169207	169208	my people	5146	” The bridesmaids cackled questions at him ; he turned his back on them . Mrs. Dodd knew her son 's face too well to waste inquiries . “
169260	169308	169207	169208	my people	5146	” she cried , in such a burst of mother 's anguish long restrained , that even the insult to the bride was forgotten for one moment , till she was seen tottering into her mother 's arms and cringing and trying to hide bodily in her : “
169317	169321	169207	169208	my people	5146	” she moaned ; “
169326	169347	169207	169208	my people	5146	” Well , they all did what they could . Jane hung round her neck and sobbed , and said , “
169358	169377	169207	169208	my people	5146	” The bridesmaids cried . The young curate ran and got the fly to the vestry - door : “
169382	169386	169207	169208	my people	5146	” he said , “
169397	169398	169393	169395	the curious crowd	5151	” “
169406	169532	169403	169404	Mr. Hurd	723	” said Edward , half choked . He hurried the insulted bride and her mother in ; Julia huddled and shrank into a corner under Mrs. Dodd 's shawl : Mrs. Dodd had all the blinds down in a moment ; and they went home as from a funeral . Ay , and a funeral it was ; for the sweetest girl in England buried her hopes , her laugh , her May of youth , in that church that day . When she got to Albion Villa , she cast a wild look all around for fear she should be seen in her wedding clothes , and darted moaning into the house . Sarah met her in the hall , smirking ; and saying , “
169538	169692	169534	169534	you	5152	” The poor bride screamed fearfully at the mocking words , and cut the conventional phrase in two as with a razor ; then fled to her own room and tore off her wreath , her veil , her pearls , and had already strewed the room , when Mrs. Dodd , with a foot quickened by affection , burst in and caught her half fainting , and laid her weary as old age , and cold as a stone , upon her mother 's bosom , and rocked her as in the days of happy childhood never to return , and bedewed the pale face with her own tears . Sampson took the bridesmaids each to her residence , on purpose to leave Edward free . He came home , washed his face , and , sick at heart , but more master of himself , knocked timidly at Julia 's door . “
169699	169794	169696	169697	my son	9193	” said a broken voice . He crept in , and saw a sorry sight . The travelling dress and bonnet were waiting still on the bed ; the bridal wreath and veil lay on the floor ; and so did half the necklace , and the rest of the pearls all about the floor ; and Julia , with all her hair loose and hanging below her waist , lay faintly quivering in her mother 's arms . Edward stood and looked , and groaned . Mrs. Dodd whispered to him over Julia : “
169803	169804	169534	169534	you	5152	” “
169810	169815	169826	169826	he	5154	” moaned the girl : “
169840	169849	169884	169884	God	481	” Mrs. Dodd whispered again over her girl . “
169864	169865	169884	169884	God	481	” “
169871	169875	169868	169868	I	0	” gasped Edward . “
169891	169902	169903	169903	My	0	” Edward knelt on the floor and took her hand — “
169908	169921	169903	169903	My	0	” he said , in a voice broken with pity and emotion , “
169934	169935	169923	169923	you	265	” “
169972	169973	169974	169974	You	265	” “
169980	169984	169985	169985	I	0	” he groaned . “
170054	170117	170122	170122	I	0	” AT these plain proofs of Alfred 's infidelity , Julia 's sweet throat began to swell hysterically , and then her bosom to heave and pant : and , after a piteous struggle , came a passion of sobs and tears so wild , so heart - broken , that Edward blamed himself bitterly for telling her . But Mrs. Dodd sobbed “
170145	170323	170326	170326	man	8747	” She rocked and nursed her deserted child hours and hours : and so the miserable day crawled to its close . Downstairs the house looked strange and gloomy : she , who had brightened it all , was darkened herself . The wedding breakfast and flowers remained in bitter mockery . Sarah cleared half the table , and Sampson and Edward dined in moody silence . Presently Sampson 's eye fell upon the Deed : it lay on a small table with a pen beside it , to sign on their return from church . Sampson got hold of it and dived in the verbiage . He came up again with a discovery . In spite of its feebleness , verbosity , obscurity , and idiotic way of expressing itself , the Deed managed to convey to David and Mrs. Dodd a life interest in nine thousand five hundred pounds , with reversion to Julia and the children of the projected marriage . Sampson and Edward put their heads over this , and it puzzled them , “
170328	170332	170326	170326	man	8747	” said Sampson , “
170349	170350	170342	170342	he	5170	” “
170353	170357	170342	170342	he	5170	” said Edward , “
170367	170368	170361	170361	he	5170	” “
170387	170388	170380	170381	the lad	5172	” “
170418	170432	170406	170406	he	5170	” Sampson changed the subject by inquiring suddenly which way he was gone . “
170489	170497	170499	170500	the Doctor	8653	“ What ninnies you young men are , ”
170502	170527	170499	170500	the Doctor	8653	“ even you , that I dub ' my fathom o ' good sense : ' just finish your denner and come with me . ”
170528	170561	170563	170563	he	254	“ No , Doctor ; I 'm off my feed for once : if you had been upstairs and seen my poor sister ! Hang the grub ; it turns my stomach . ”
170673	170677	170679	170680	the Doctor	8653	“ Come away , ”
170726	170736	170715	170715	Sampson	357	“ Where did you drive young Hardie this morning ? ”
170754	170765	170737	170737	He	357	“ Why , that is the party from Mill Street . ”
170766	170769	170715	170715	Sampson	357	“ Yes . ”
170770	170794	170715	170715	Sampson	357	“ Druv him to Silverton station , sir : and was n't long about it , either — gent was in a hurry . ”
170795	170803	170737	170737	He	357	“ What train did he go by ? ”
170804	170821	170715	170715	Sampson	357	“ Well , I do n't know , sir ; I left him at the station . ”
170822	170857	170858	170859	The ostler	11247	“ Well , then , where did he take his ticket for ? Where did he tell the porter he was going ? Think now , and I 'll give y ' a sovereign . ”
170880	170912	170858	170859	The ostler	11247	“ I should only be robbing you gents . Ye see , he paid the fly then and there , and gave me a crown : and I druv away directly . ”
170932	170950	170929	170929	Edward	254	“ Doctor , I do n't like that fellow 's looks : let us try the landlord . ”
170997	171019	170988	170988	She	5194	“ Pair horse fly to Silverton : take up in Mill Street at eight o'clock . Is that it , sir ? ”
171035	171075	171076	171076	Bradshaw	727	“ No : it is Silverton in the book , sir . Well , you see it is all one to us ; the station is further than the town , but we charge seven miles whichever ' tis . ”
171176	171244	171172	171172	he	254	“ Bring sceince to bear on this hotch - potch . Facks are never really opposed to facks ; they onnly seem to be : and the true solution is the one which riconciles all the facks : for instance , the chronothairmal Therey riconciles all th ' undisputed facks in midicine . So now sairch for a solution to riconcile the Deed with the puppy levanting . ”
171257	171262	171264	171264	Sampson	357	“ Ca n't you ? ”
171266	171286	171264	171264	Sampson	357	“ then I 'll give you a couple . Say he is touched in the upper story for one . ”
171287	171295	171172	171172	he	254	“ What do you mean ? Mad ? ”
171296	171355	171356	171356	Edward	254	“ Oh : there are degrees of Phrinzy . Here is th ' inconsistency of conduct that marks a disturbance of the reason : and , to tell the truth , I once knew a young fellow that played this very prank at a wedding , and the nixt thing we hard , my lorrd was in Bedlam . ”
171361	171373	171358	171358	his	254	“ It is the villain 's heart , not his brain . ”
171389	171545	171382	171382	he	254	“ He has been courting some other wumman first : she declined , or made believe ; but , when she found he had the spirit to go and marry an innocent girl , then the jade wrote to him and yielded . It 's a married one , likely . I 've known women go further for hatred of a wumman than they would for love of a man and here was a temptation ! to snap a lover off th ' altar , and insult a rival , all at one blow . He meant to marry : he meant to sign that deed : ay and at his age , even if he had signed it , he would have gone off at passion 's call , and beggared himself . What enrages me is that we did n't let him sign it , and so nail the young rascal 's money . ”
171546	171551	171553	171553	Edward	254	“ Curse his money , ”
171555	171579	171553	171553	Edward	254	“ and him too . Wait till I can lay my hand on him : I 'll break every bone in his skin . ”
171580	171587	171382	171382	he	254	“ And I 'll help you . ”
171747	171814	171742	171742	his	357	“ Of course you ca n't ; you are Anglosaxins ; th ' Anglosaxins are good at drawing distinctions : but they ca n't gineralise . I 'm a Celt , and gineralise — as a duck swims . I discovered th ' unity of all disease : it would be odd if I could not trace the maniform iniquities you suffer to their one source . ”
171815	171823	171825	171826	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ But what is the connecting link ? ”
171831	171839	171825	171826	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Why , Richard Hardie 's interest . ”
171840	171847	171849	171849	Edward	254	“ Well , but the letter ? ”
171851	171859	171861	171861	Sampson	357	“ There goes th ' Anglosaxin again , ”
171863	171969	171861	171861	Sampson	357	“ puzzling his head over petty details ; and they are perhaps mere blinds thrown out by the enemy . Put this and that together : Hardie senior always averse to this marriage ; Hardie senior wanting to keep 14,000l . of yours : if his son , who knows of the fraud , became your mother 's son , the swinidle would be hourly in danger ( no connection ? y ' unhappy Anglosaxins ; why the two things are interwoven ) . And so young Hardie is got out of the way : old Hardie 's doing , or I 'm a Dutchman . ”
172004	172163	172193	172193	Sampson	357	“ Well , that is possible , too : whativer tempted man has done , tempted man will do : but more likely he has bribed Jezebel to write and catch the goose by the heart . Gintlennen , I 'm a bit of a physiognomist : look at old Hardie 's lines ; his cords , I might say : and deeper every time I see him . Sirs , there 's an awful weight on that man 's mind . Looksee ! I 'll just send a small trifle of a detective down to watch his game , and pump his people : and , as soon as it is safe , we 'll seize the old bird , and , once he is trapped the young one will reappear like magic : th ' old one will disgorge ; we 'll just compound the felony — been an old friend — and recover the cash . ”
172215	172225	172227	172227	he	254	“ Attorneys are too humdrum for such a job , ”
172229	172319	172227	172227	he	254	“ they start with a civil letter putting a rogue on his guard ; they proceed t ' a writ and then he digs a hole in another county and buries the booty ; or sails t ' Australia with it . N'list'me ; I 'm an old friend , and an insane lover of justice — I say insane , because my passion is not returned , or the jade would n't keep out of my way so all these years — you leave all this to me . ”
172320	172325	172327	172327	Edward	254	“ Stop a minute , ”
172329	172349	172327	172327	Edward	254	“ you must not go compromising us : and we have no money to pay for luxuries like detectives . ”
172350	172371	172227	172227	he	254	“ I wo n't compromise any one of you : and my detective sha n't cost y ' a penny . ”
172372	172379	172381	172382	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Ah , my dear friend , ”
172384	172456	172381	172382	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ the fact is , you do not know all the difficulties that beset us . Tell him , Edward . Well , then , let me . The poor boy is attached to this gentleman 's daughter , whom you propose to treat like a felon : and he is too good a son and too good a friend for me to — what , what , shall I do ? ”
172464	172472	172474	172474	he	254	“ Who told you that , mother ? ”
172476	172496	172498	172500	the poor fellow	5208	“ Well , yes , I do love her , and I 'm not ashamed of it . Doctor , ”
172505	172532	172498	172500	the poor fellow	5208	“ I see now I am not quite the person to advise my mother in this matter . I consent to leave it in your hands . ”
172546	172553	172555	172555	Sampson	357	“ There 's a damnable combination , ”
172558	172602	172555	172555	Sampson	357	“ Truth is sairtainly more wonderful than feckshin . Here 's my fathom o ' good sense in love with a wax doll , and her brother jilting his sister , and her father pillaging his mother . It beats hotch - potch . ”
172620	172660	172612	172613	Miss Hardie	277	“ An inestimable young lady ; but so odd ; she is one of these uneasy - minded Christians that have sprung up : a religious egotist , and malade imaginaire , eternally feeling her own spiritual pulse — — ”
172661	172667	172669	172669	Sampson	357	“ I know the disorrder , ”
172672	172794	172669	172669	Sampson	357	“ the pashints have a hot fit ( and then they are saints ): followed in due course by the cold fit ( and then they are the worst of sinners ): and so on in endless rotation : and , if they could only realise my great discovery , the perriodicity of all disease , and time their sintiments , they would find the hot fit and the cold return chronometrically , at intervals as rigular as the tide 's ebb and flow ; and the soul has nothing to do with either febrile symptom . Why Religion , apart from intermittent Fever of the Brain , is just the caumest , peaceablest , sedatest thing in all the world . ”
172795	173027	172669	172669	Sampson	357	“ Ah , you are too deep for me , my good friend . All I know is that she is one of this new school , whom I take the liberty to call ' THE FIDGETY CHRISTIANS . ' They can not let their poor souls alone a minute ; and they pester one day and night with the millennium ; as if we shall not all be dead long before that . But the worst is , they apply the language of earthly passion to the Saviour of mankind , and make one 's flesh creep at their blasphemies ; so coarse , so familiar : like that rude multitude which thronged and pressed Him when on earth . But , after all , she came to the church , and took my Julia 's part ; so that shows she has principle ; and do pray spare me her feelings in any step you take against that dishonourable person her father . I must go back to his victim , my poor , poor child — I dare not leave her long . Oh , Doctor , such a night ! and , if she dozes for a minute , it is to wake with a scream and tell me she sees him dead : sometimes he is drowned ; sometimes stained with blood , but always dead . ”
173104	173109	173111	173111	he	264	“ The young scamp , ”
173118	173138	173113	173113	he	264	“ It is no business of mine . I had no hand in making the match , thank Heaven . ”
173174	173190	173192	173192	he	264	“ This will recoil upon our name , you know , at this critical time , ”
173209	173213	173215	173215	she	276	“ Dear papa , ”
173217	173302	173215	173215	she	276	“ it was made clear to me that the Dodds are acting in what they consider a most friendly way to you . They think — I can not tell you what they think . But , if mistaken , they are sincere : and so , after prayer , and you not being here for me to consult , I did go to the church . Forgive me , papa : I have but one brother ; and she is my dear friend . ”
173327	173440	173322	173322	he	264	“ I will be frank with you , Jenny : if the wedding had come off ; I should have been deeply hurt at your supporting that little monster of ingratitude . He not only marries against his father 's will ( that is done every day ) , but slanders and maligns him publicy in his hour of poverty and distress . But now that he has broken faith and insulted Miss Dodd as well as me , I declare I am glad you were there , Jenny . It will separate us from his abominable conduct . But what does he say for himself ? What reason does he give ? ”
173441	173451	173215	173215	she	276	“ Oh , it is all mystery as yet . ”
173452	173466	173322	173322	he	264	“ Well , but he must have sent some explanation to the Dodds . ”
173467	173531	173532	173532	she	5213	“ He may have : I do n't know . I have not ventured to intrude on my poor insulted friend . Papa , I hear her distress is fearful ; they fear for her reason . Oh , if harm comes to her , God will assuredly punish him whose heartlessness and treachery has brought her to it . Mark my words , ”
173538	173551	173532	173532	she	5213	“ this cruel act will not go unpunished even in this world . ”
173552	173561	173563	173564	Mr. Hardie	264	“ There , there , change the subject , ”
173567	173593	173563	173564	Mr. Hardie	264	“ What have I to do with his pranks ? He has disowned me for his father , and I disown him for my son . ”
173743	173760	173727	173727	his	264	“ Oh no , papa : indeed I have no fault to find with poor Peggy . ”
173761	173785	173786	173786	Peggy	705	“ Well , then , go to your work , and try and not offend Betty ; remember she is older than you . ”
173873	173876	173877	173877	she	255	“ Edward , ”
173884	173927	173877	173877	she	255	“ there is foul play : I can not sleep , I can not be idle . He has been decoyed away , and perhaps murdered . Oh , pray get up and go to the police office or somewhere with me . ”
173928	173937	173988	173988	her	255	“ Very well ; but wait till morning . ”
173938	173978	173979	173979	Her	255	“ No ; now ; now — now — now . I shall never go out of doors in the daytime again . Wait ? I 'm going crazy with wait , wait , wait , wait , waiting . ”
173993	173996	173998	173998	Edward	254	“ There , ”
174003	174015	173998	173998	Edward	254	“ go downstairs , and I will be with you directly . ”
174134	174195	174123	174123	he	254	“ The superintendent asked to see the letter ; I told him he had taken it with him : that was a pity , he said . Then he made me describe Alfred to a nicety : and the description will go up to London this morning , and all over Barkington , and the neighbourhood , and the county . ”
174224	174243	174221	174221	Edward	254	“ the superintendent felt quite sure that the villain was not dead ; nor in danger of it . ”
174244	174257	174221	174221	Edward	254	“ Oh , bless him ! bless him ! for saying so . ”
174258	174336	174337	174337	She	5226	“ And that he will turn up in London before very long ; not in this neighbourhood . He says he must have known the writer of the letter , and his taking his luggage with him shows he has gone off deliberately . My poor little Ju , now do try and look at it as he does , and everybody else does ; try and see it as you would if you were a bystander . ”
174357	174533	174337	174337	She	5226	“ I do see I am a poor credulous girl ; but how can my Alfred be false to me ? Am I to doubt the Bible ? Am I to doubt the sun ? Is nothing true in heaven or earth ? Oh , if I could only have died as I was dressing for church — died while he seemed true ! He is true ; the wicked creature has cast some spell on him : he has gone in a moment of delirium ; he will regret what he has done , perhaps regrets it now . I am ungrateful to you , Edward , and to the good policeman , for saying he is not dead . What more do I require ? He is dead to me . Edward , let us leave this place . We were going : let us go to - day ; this very day ; oh , take me , and hide me where no one that knows me can ever see me again . ”
174772	174784	174760	174760	persons	5236	“ ALEXANDER SAMPSON , 39 Pope Street , Napoleon Square London . ”
174827	174981	174809	174809	she	705	“ MR . ALFRED , SIR,—Margaret Black sends her respects , and if you want to know the truth about the money , I can tell you all , and where it is at this present time . Sir , I am now in situation at Silverton Grove House , about a furlong from the station ; and if you will be so good to call there and ask for Margaret , I will tell you where it is , which I mean the 14,000l . ; for it is a sin the young lady should be beguiled of her own . Only you must please come this evening , or else to - morrow before ten o'clock , by reason my mistress and me we are going up to London that day early , and she talk of taking me abroad along with her.—I remain , Sir , yours respectfully to command , “
174997	175124	174809	174809	she	705	” Alfred read this twice over , and felt a contemptuous repugnance towards the writer , a cashiered servant , who offered to tell the truth out of spite , having easily resisted every worthy motive . Indeed , I think he would have perhaps dismissed the subject into the fire , but for a strange circumstance that had occurred to him this very afternoon ; but I had no opportunity to relate it till now . Well , just as he was going to dress for dinner , he received a visit from Dr. Wycherley , a gentleman he scarcely knew by name . Dr. Wycherley inquired after his kephalalgia : Alfred stared and told him it was much the same ; troubled him occasionally . “
175129	175130	175131	175131	I	0	” “
175145	175295	175139	175139	you	1075	” Dr. Wycherley smiled with a sort of benevolent superiority that galled his patient , and proceeded to inquire after his nightly visions and voices . But at this Alfred looked grave as well as surprised and vexed . He was on his guard now , and asked himself seriously what was the meaning of all this , and could his father have been so mad as to talk over his own shame with this stranger : he made no reply whatever . Dr. Wycherley 's curiosity was not of a very ardent kind : for he was one of those who first form an opinion , and then collect the materials of one : and a very little fact goes a long way with such minds . So , when he got no answer about the nocturnal visions and voices , he glided calmly on to another matter . “
175306	175316	175139	175139	you	1075	” Alfred started , and then eyed him keenly : “
175321	175322	175139	175139	you	1075	” “
175341	175351	175139	175139	you	1075	” This was too much for Alfred 's patience . “
175362	175366	175360	175360	sir	1075	” said he ; “
175417	175418	175404	175404	you	5240	” “
175429	175435	175404	175404	you	5240	” replied the oleaginous one . “
175460	175461	175404	175404	you	5240	” “
175498	175499	175486	175486	I	0	” “
175506	175550	175551	175551	Excited!—Very	737	” said the doctor , driven to plain English by anger , that great solvent of circumlocution with which Nature has mercifully supplied us . He made to the door , opened it , and said in considerable excitement to some one outside , “
175553	175646	175551	175551	Excited!—Very	737	” Now Dr. Pleonast had no sooner been converted to the vernacular , and disappeared , than another stranger entered the room . He had evidently been lurking in the passage : it was a man of smallish stature , singularly gaunt , angular , and haggard , but dressed in a spruce suit of black , tight , new , and glossy . In short , he looked like Romeo 's apothecary gone to Stultz with the money . He fluttered in with pale cheek and apprehensive body , saying hurriedly , “
175690	175691	175687	175687	you	10505	” “
175707	175708	175709	175717	A person to whom your health is very dear	5249	” “
175719	175720	175709	175717	A person to whom your health is very dear	5249	” “
175753	175754	175755	175755	I	0	” “
175763	175769	175755	175755	I	0	” said the little man : “
175783	175800	175776	175777	Dr. Wycherley	659	” And he handed Alfred a card , on which his name and profession were written . “
175806	175810	175803	175804	Mr. Speers	740	” said Alfred , “
175832	175833	175829	175829	you	740	” “
175892	175893	175923	175923	I	0	” “
175898	175899	175923	175923	I	0	” “
175907	175908	175904	175904	you	1075	” “
175925	175926	175923	175923	I	0	” “
175980	176000	176001	176002	Mr. Speers	740	” At this Alfred rose and put his hands in his pockets and looked down grimly on his inquisitor . “
176004	176008	176001	176002	Mr. Speers	740	” said he , “
176078	176273	176274	176274	Injustice	741	” At these suggestive words , spoken with suppressed ire and flashing eyes , Speers scuttled to the door crabwise , holding the young lion in check conventionally — to wit , with an eye as valiant as a sheep 's ; and a joyful apothecary was he when he found himself safe outside the house and beside Dr. Wycherley , who was waiting for him . Alfred soon cooled , and began to laugh at his own anger and the unbounded impudence of his visitors : but , on the other hand , it struck him as a grave circumstance that so able a man as his father should stir muddy water ; should go and talk to these strangers about the money he had misappropriated . He puzzled himself all the time he was dressing : and , not to trouble the reader with all the conjectures that passed through his mind , he concluded at last , that Mr. Hardie must feel very strong , very sure there was no evidence against him but his son 's , or he would not take the eighth commandment by the horns like this . “
176282	176479	176274	176274	Injustice	741	” thought Alfred , with a sigh . He was not the youth to imitate his father 's shamelessness : so he locked this last incident in his own breast ; did not even mention it to Julia . But now , on reading Peggy 's note , his warlike instincts awoke , and , though he despised his correspondent and her motives , he could not let such a chance pass of defeating brazen injustice . It was unfortunate and awkward to have to go to Silverton on his wedding morning ; but , after all , there was plenty of time . He packed up his things at once for the wedding tour , and in the morning took them with him in the fly to Silverton : his plan was to come back direct to Albion Villa : so he went to Silverton Grove full dressed , all ready for the wedding . As it happened he overtook his friend Peterson just outside the town , called to him gaily , and invited him to church and breakfast . To his surprise the young gentleman replied sullenly that he should certainly not come . “
176486	176492	176493	176493	You	8434	” said Alfred , hurt . “
176502	176546	176493	176493	You	8434	” retorted the other . This led to an explanation . Peterson 's complaint was that he had told Alfred he was in love with Julia , and Alfred had gone directly and fallen in love with her just to cut him out . “
176553	176557	176549	176549	you	0	” said Alfred . “
176592	176593	176585	176586	my father	1958	” “
176602	176603	176598	176598	you	0	” “
176614	176615	176598	176598	you	0	” “
176629	176630	176631	176631	You	0	” “
176662	176912	176652	176652	you	0	” And so ended that little friendship . On the road our ardent youth arranged in his head a noble scheme . He would bring Peggy Black home with him , compensating her liberally for the place she would thereby lose : would confront her privately with his father , and convince him it was his interest to restore the Dodds their money with a good grace , take the L. 5000 he had already offered , and countenance the wedding by letting Jane be present at it . It was hard to do all this in the time , but well worth trying for , and not impossible . A two - horse fly is not a slow conveyance , and he offered the man a guinea to drive fast ; so that it was not nine o'clock when they reached Silverton Grove House , a place Alfred had never heard of . This , however , I may observe , was no wonder : for it had not borne that name a twelve - month . It was a large square mansion of red brick , with stone facings and corners , and with balustrades that hid the garret windows . It stood in its own grounds , and the entrance was through handsome iron gates , one of which was wide open to admit people on foot or horseback . The flyman got down and tried to open the other , but could not manage it . “
176920	176925	176927	176927	me	0	” said Alfred impatiently , “
176930	176939	176927	176927	me	0	” He found a notice under the bell , “
176944	177015	176927	176927	me	0	” He rang accordingly , and at the clang the hall - door opened , as if he had pulled a porter along with the bell ; and a grey - haired servant out of livery stood on the steps to receive him . Alfred hurried across the plat , which was trimmed as neatly as a college green , and asked the servant if he could see Margaret Black . “
177019	177025	177016	177017	Margaret Black	736	” said the man doubtfully : “
177037	177259	177271	177271	her	5265	” They entered a handsome hall , with antlers and armour : from this a double staircase led up to a landing with folding doors in the centre of it ; one of these doors was wide open like the iron gate outside . The servant showed Alfred up the left - hand staircase , through the open door , into a spacious drawing - room , handsomely though not gaily furnished and decorated , but a little darkened by Venetian blinds . The old servant walked gravely on and on , till Alfred began to think he would butt the wall ; but he put his hand out and opened a door that might very well escape a stranger 's notice ; for it was covered with looking - glass , and matched another narrow mirror in shape and size . This door led into a very long room , as plain and even sordid as the drawing - room was inviting : the unpapered walls were a cold drab , and wanted washing ; there was a thick cobweb up in one corner , and from the ceiling hung the tail of another , which the housemaid 's broom had scotched not killed : that side of the room they entered by was all books . The servant said , “
177275	177394	177268	177268	I	0	” With this he retired into the drawing - room , closing the door softly after him : once closed it became invisible ; it fitted like wax , and left nothing to be seen but books ; not even a knob . It shut to with that gentle but clean click which a spring bolt , however polished and oiled and gently closed , will emit . Altogether it was enough to give some people a turn . But Alfred 's nerves were not to be affected by trifles ; he put his hands in his pockets and walked up and down the room , quietly enough at first , but by - and - bye uneasily . “
177402	177406	177268	177268	I	0	” thought he ; “
177413	177477	177410	177410	she	5265	” Then , as he had learned to pick up the fragments of time , and hated dawdling , he went to take a book from the shelves . He found it was a piece of iron , admirably painted : it chilled his hand with its unexpected coldness : and all the books on and about the door were iron and chilly . “
177480	177484	177410	177410	she	5265	” thought he , “
177520	177768	177504	177504	he	8724	” Still Peggy did not come . So he went to a door opposite , and at right angles to the farthest window , meaning to open it and inquire after her : lo and behold he found this was a knob without a door . There had been a door but it was blocked up . The only available door on that side had a keyhole , but no latch , nor handle . Alfred was a prisoner . He no sooner found this out than he began to hammer on the door with his fists , and call out . This had a good effect , for he heard a woman 's dress come rustling : a key was inserted , and the door opened . But , instead of Peggy , it was a tall well - formed woman of thirty , with dark grey eyes , and straightish eyebrows massive and black as jet . She was dressed quietly but like a lady . Mrs. Archbold , for that was her name , cast on Alfred one of those swift , all - devouring glances , with which her sex contrive to take in the features , character , and dress of a person from head to foot , and smiled most graciously on him , revealing a fine white set of teeth . She begged him to take a seat ; and sat down herself . She had left the door ajar . “
177776	177780	177781	177782	Margaret Black	736	” said Alfred . “
177791	177797	177786	177788	no such person	5269	” was the quiet reply . “
177809	177818	177801	177801	she	736	” Mrs. Archbold smiled , and said soothingly , “
177831	177876	177877	177877	I	0	” Alfred laughed at this , and showed her Peggy 's letter . She ran her eye over it , and returned it him with a smile of a different kind , half pitying , half cynical . But presently resuming her former manner , “
177881	177888	177877	177877	I	0	” said she in dulcet tones : “
177907	177908	177912	177912	you	0	” “
177920	177926	177912	177912	you	0	” said he , surprised . “
177945	177963	177942	177943	Mr. Hardie	312	” was the reply , in a voice of very honey . Alfred was amazed at this . “
178001	178002	178004	178004	yourself	0	” “
178006	178022	178004	178004	yourself	0	” said Mrs. Archbold , laying a white and finely moulded hand upon his arm , “
178037	178179	178004	178004	yourself	0	” The colour rushed into Alfred 's face , and he started to his feet ; some vague instinct told him to be gone from this place . The lady fixed her eyes on him , put her hand to a gold chain that was round her neck , and drew out of her white bosom , not a locket , nor a key , but an ivory whistle . Keeping her eye steadily fixed on Alfred , she breathed softly into the whistle . Then two men stepped quietly in at the door ; one was a short , stout snob , with great red whiskers , the other a wiry gentleman with iron - grey hair . The latter spoke to Alfred , and began to coax him . If Mrs. Archbold was honey , this personage was treacle . “
178222	178223	178226	178226	you	0	” “
178235	178239	178232	178232	you	0	” cried Alfred ; “
178244	178245	178232	178232	you	0	” “
178252	178263	178232	178232	you	0	” said the short snob , with a coarse laugh . “
178272	178277	178232	178232	you	0	” said Alfred sharply ; “
178291	178313	178232	178232	you	0	” The short man instantly stepped to the door , and put his back to it . The other said calmly , “
178328	178329	178316	178317	Mr. Hardie	312	” “
178339	178356	178357	178357	We	5277	” said Alfred , drawing his breath hard : and his eyes began to glitter dangerously . “
178381	178382	178357	178357	We	5277	” “
178389	178396	178357	178357	We	5277	” said Alfred , panting now ; “
178402	178403	178357	178357	We	5277	” “
178408	178414	178357	178357	We	5277	” said Mrs. Archbold soothingly : “
178440	178441	178357	178357	We	5277	” “
178446	178453	178357	178357	We	5277	” said the short snob brutally . “
178479	178485	178462	178462	You	312	” At this fatal word , “
178488	178760	178462	178462	You	312	” Alfred uttered a cry of horror and despair , and his eyes roved wildly round the room in search of escape . But the windows of the room , though outside the house they seemed to come as low as those of the drawing - room , were partly bricked - up within , and made just too high to be reached without a chair . And his captors read that wild glance directly , and the doctor whipped one chair away , while Mrs. Archbold , with more tact , sat quietly down on the other . They all three blew their whistles shrilly . Alfred uttered an oath and rushed at the door ; but heard heavy feet running on stone passages towards the whistles , and felt he had no chance out that way : his dilating eye fell upon the handle of the old defunct door : he made a high leap , came down with his left foot on its knob of brass , and , though of course he could not stand on it , contrived to spring from it slap at the window — Mrs. Archbold screamed — he broke the glass with his shoulder , and tore and kicked the woodwork , and squeezed through on to a stone ledge outside , and stood there bleeding and panting , just as half a dozen keepers burst into the room at his back . He was more than twenty feet from the ground : to leap down was death or mutilation : he saw the flyman driving away . He yelled to him , “
178769	179632	178462	178462	You	312	” The flyman stopped and looked round . But soon as he saw who it was , he just grinned : Alfred could see his hideous grin ; and there was the rattle of chairs being brought to the window , and men were mounting softly to secure him . A coarse hand stole towards his ankle ; he took a swift step and sprang desperately on to the next ledge — it was an old manor house , and these ledges were nearly a foot broad — from this one he bounded to the next , and then to a third , the last but one on this side of the building . The corner ledge was but half the size , and offered no safe footing : but close to it he saw the outside leaves of a tree . That tree , then , must grow close to the corner ; could he but get round to it he might yet reach the ground whole . Urged by that terror of a madhouse which is natural to a sane man , and in England is fed by occasional disclosures , and the general suspicion they excite , he leaped on to a piece of stone no bigger than one 's hat , and then whirled himself round into the tree , all eyes to see and claws to grasp . It was a weeping ash : he could get hold of nothing but soft yielding slivers , that went through his fingers , and so down with him like a bulrush , and souse he went with his hands full of green leaves over head and ears into the water of an enormous iron tank that fed the baths . The heavy plunge , the sudden cold water , the instant darkness , were appalling : yet , like the fox among the hounds , the gallant young gentleman did not lose heart nor give tongue . He came up gurgling and gasping , and swimming for his life in manly silence : he swam round and round the edge of the huge tank , trying in vain to get a hold upon its cold rusty walls . He heard whistles and voices about : they came faint to him where he was , but he knew they could not be very far off . Life is sweet . It flashed across him how , a few years before , a university man of great promise had perished miserably in a tank on some Swiss mountain — a tank placed for the comfort of travellers . He lifted his eyes to Heaven in despair , and gave one great sob . Then he turned upon his back and floated : but he was obliged to paddle with his hands a little to keep up . A window opened a few feet above him , and a face peered out between the bars . Then he gave all up for lost , and looked to hear a voice denounce him ; but no : the livid face and staring eyes at the window took no notice of him : it was a maniac , whose eyes , bereft of reason , conveyed no images to the sentient brain . Only by some half vegetable instinct this darkened man was turning towards the morning sun , and staring it full in the face . Alfred saw the rays strike and sparkle on those glassy orbs , and fire them ; yet they never so much as winked . He was appalled yet fascinated by this weird sight : could not take his eyes off it , and shuddered at it in the very water . With such creatures as that he must be confined , or die miserably like a mouse in a basin of water . He hesitated between two horrors . Presently his foot struck something , and he found it was a large pipe that entered the tank to the distance of about a foot This pipe was not more than three feet under water , and Alfred soon contrived to get upon it , and rest his fingers upon the iron edge of the tank . The position was painful : yet so he determined to remain till night : and then , if possible , steal away . Every faculty of mind and body was strung up to defend himself against the wretches who had entrapped him . He had not been long in this position , when voices approached , and next the shadow of a ladder moved across the wall towards him . The keepers were going to search his pitiable hiding - place . They knew , what he did not , that there was no outlet from the premises : so now , having hunted every other corner and cranny , they came by what is called the exhaustive process of reasoning to this tank ; and when they got near it , something in the appearance of the tree caught the gardener 's quick eye . Alfred quaking heard him say , “
179643	179648	179636	179636	He	5285	” Another voice said , “
179671	179729	179665	179665	I	0	” At this Alfred was conscious of a movement and a murmur , that proved humanity was not extinct ; and the ladder was fixed close to the tank , and feet came hastily up it . Alfred despaired . But , as usual with spirits so quickwitted and resolute , it was but for a moment . “
179739	179853	179730	179731	One man	2596	” he caught at the words he had heard , and played the game the jackal desperate plays in India , the fox in England , the elephant in Ceylon : he feigned death ; filled his mouth with water , floated on his back paddling imperceptibly , and half closed his eyes . He was rewarded by a loud shout of dismay just above his head , and very soon another ladder was placed on the other side , and with ropes and hands he was drawn out and carried down the ladder : he took this opportunity to discharge the water from his mouth , on which a coarse voice said , “
179864	179909	179921	179921	he	2596	” However , they laid him on the grass , and sent for the doctor ; then took off his coat , and one of them began to feel his heart to see whether there was any pulsation left : he found it thumping . “
179913	179920	179921	179921	he	2596	” he cried in some alarm ; “
179926	180254	179921	179921	he	2596	” But , before the words were well uttered , Alfred , who was a practised gymnast , bounded off the ground without touching it with his hands , and fled like a deer towards the front of the house : for he remembered the open iron gate . The attendants followed shouting , and whistle answered whistle all over the grounds . Alfred got safe to the iron gate : alas ! it had been closed at the first whistle twenty minutes ago . He turned in rage and desperation , and the head - keeper , a powerful man , was rushing incautiously upon him . Alfred instantly steadied himself , and with his long arm caught the man in full career a left - handed blow like the kick of a pony , that laid his cheek open and knocked him stupid and staggering . He followed it up like lightning with his right , and , throwing his whole weight into this second blow , sent the staggering man to grass ; slipped past another , and skirting the south side of the house got to the tank again well in advance of his pursuers , seized the ladder , carried it to the garden wall , and was actually half way up it , and saw the open country and liberty , when the ladder was dragged away and he fell heavily to the ground , and a keeper threw himself bodily on him . Alfred half expected this , and drawing up his foot in time , dashed it furiously in the coming face , actually knocking the man backwards . Another kneeled on his chest : Alfred caught him by the throat so felly that he lost all power , and they rolled over and over together , and Alfred got clear and ran for it again , and got on the middle of the lawn , and hallooed to the house:—“Hy
180276	180443	180445	180445	him	5291	” Instantly the open windows were filled with white faces , some grinning , some exulting , all greatly excited ; and a hideous uproar shook the whole place — for the poor souls were all sane in their own opinion — and the whole force of attendants , two of them bleeding profusely from his blows , made a cordon and approached him . But he was too cunning to wait to be fairly surrounded ; he made his rush at an under - keeper , feinted at his head , caught him a heavy blow in the pit of the stomach , doubled him up in a moment , and off again , leaving the man on his knees vomiting and groaning . Several mild maniacs ran out in vast agitation , and , to curry favour , offered to help catch him . Vast was their zeal . But when it came to the point , they only danced wildly about and cried , “
180469	180603	180604	180604	I	0	” And , whenever he came near them , away they ran whining like kicked curs . Mrs. Archbold , looking out at a window , advised them all to let him alone , and she would come out and persuade him . But they would not be advised : they chased him about the lawn ; but so swift of foot was he , and so long in the reach , that no one of them could stop him , nor indeed come near him , without getting a facer that came like a flash of lightning . At last , however , they got so well round him , he saw his chance was gone : he took off his hat to Mrs. Archbold at the window , and said quietly , “
180611	180654	180604	180604	I	0	” At these words they rushed on him rashly . On this he planted two blows right and left , swift as a cat attacked by dogs ; administered two fearful black eyes , and instantly folded his arms , saying haughtily , “
180668	180924	180658	180659	the lady	1031	” They seized him , shook their fists in his face , cursed him , and pinned him . He was quite passive : they handcuffed him , and drove him before them , shoving him every now and then roughly by the shoulders . He made no resistance , spoke no word . They took him to the strong - room , and manacled his ankles together with an iron hobble , and then strapped them to the bed - posts , and fastened his body down by broad bands of ticking with leathern straps at the ends : and so left him more helpless than a swaddled infant . The hurry and excitement of defence were over , and a cold stupor of misery came down and sat like lead on him . He lay mute as death in his gloomy cell , a tomb within a living tomb . And , as he lay , deeper horror grew and grew in his dilating eyes : gusts of rage swept over him , shook him , and passed : then gusts of despairing tenderness ; all came and went , but his bonds . What would his Julia think ? If he could only let her know ! At this thought he called , he shouted , he begged for a messenger ; there was no reply . The cry of a dangerous lunatic from the strong - room was less heeded here than a bark from any dog - kennel in Christendom . “
180932	180936	180658	180659	the lady	1031	” he said . “
180945	181086	180943	180943	him	1958	” and his brain seemed on fire , his temples throbbed : he vowed to God to be revenged on his father . Then he writhed at his own meanness in coming to visit a servant and his folly in being caught by so shallow an artifice . He groaned aloud . The clock in the hall struck ten . There was just time to get back if they would lend him a conveyance . He shouted , he screamed , he prayed . He offered terms humbly , piteously ; he would forgive his father , forgive them all , he would say no more about the money , would do anything , consent to anything , if they would only let him keep faith with his Julia : they had better consent , and not provoke his vengeance . “
181092	181096	180943	180943	him	1958	” he cried . “
181171	181399	181156	181156	she	1031	” He listened for an answer , he prayed for an answer . There was none . Once in a mad - house , the sanest man is mad , however interested and barefaced the motive of the relative who has brought two of the most venal class upon the earth to sign away his wits behind his back . And once hobbled and strapped , he is a dangerous maniac , for just so many days , weeks , or years , as the hobbles , handcuffs , and jacket happen to be left upon him by inhumanity , economy , or simple carelessness . Poor Alfred 's cries and prayers were heard , but no more noticed than the night howl of a wolf on some distant mountain . All was sullen silence , but the grating tongue of the clock , which told the victim of a legislature 's shallowness and a father 's avarice — that Time , deaf to his woe , as were the walls , the men , the women , and the cutting bands , was stealing away with iron finger his last chance of meeting his beloved at the altar . He closed his eyes , and saw her lovelier than ever , dressed all in white , waiting for him with sweet concern in that peerless face . “
181404	181773	181402	181402	Julia	255	” he cried , with a loud heart - broken cry . The half - hour struck . At that he struggled , he writhed , he bounded : he made the very room shake , and lacerated his flesh ; but that was all . No answer . No motion . No help . No hope . The perspiration rolled down his steaming body . The tears burst from his young eyes and ran down his cheeks . He sobbed , and sobbing almost choked , so tight were his linen bands upon his bursting bosom . He lay still exhausted . The clock ticked harshly on : the rest was silence . With this miserable exception : ever and anon the victim 's jammed body shuddered so terribly it shook and rattled the iron bedstead , and told of the storm within , the agony of the racked and all foreboding soul . For then rolled over that young head hours of mortal anguish that no tongue of man can utter , nor pen can shadow . Chained sane amongst the mad ; on his wedding - day ; expecting with tied hands the sinister acts of the soul - murderers who had the power to make their lie a truth ! We can paint the body writhing vainly against its unjust bonds ; but who can paint the loathing , agonised soul in a mental situation so ghastly ? For my part I feel it in my heart of hearts ; but am impotent to convey it to others ; impotent , impotent . Pray think of it for yourselves , men and women , if you have not sworn never to think over a novel . Think of it for your own sakes : Alfred 's turn to - day , it may be yours to - morrow . AT two o'clock an attendant stole on tiptoe to the strong - room , unlocked the door , and peeped cautiously in . Seeing the dangerous maniac quiet , he entered with a plate of lukewarm beef and potatoes , and told him bluntly to eat . The crushed one said he could not eat . “
181777	181782	181774	181774	You	5304	” said the man . “
181785	181789	181793	181793	you	5305	” said Alfred ; “
181828	181836	181808	181808	I	0	” A coarse laugh greeted this proposal . “
181852	181853	181847	181847	you	5304	” “
181858	181863	181855	181855	I	0	” said Alfred eagerly , “
181912	181913	181905	181905	I	0	” “
181921	181927	181905	181905	I	0	” said the man carelessly . “
181957	182006	181935	181935	you	5304	” And he sat down with the plate on his knee and began to cut the meat in small pieces ; while his careless words entered Alfred 's heart , and gave him such a glimpse of sinister motives and dark acts to come as set him shuddering . “
182013	182057	181935	181935	you	5304	” said the man , suspecting this shudder . He thought it was the prologue to some desperate act ; for all a chained madman does is read upon this plan : his terror passes for rage , his very sobs for snarls . “
182065	182070	182072	182072	you	5309	” said Alfred imploringly ; “
182087	182088	182072	182072	you	5309	” “
182092	182093	182094	182095	My father	1958	” “
182097	182098	182094	182095	My father	1958	” “
182105	182111	182094	182095	My father	1958	” said the man sullenly , “
182162	182163	182169	182171	a good fellow	1359	” “
182222	182223	182216	182216	you	0	” “
182236	182438	182230	182230	you	0	” said the man . Then Alfred coaxed him to take off the handcuffs . He refused , but ended by doing it ; and so left him . Four more leaden hours rolled by , and then this same attendant ( his name was Brown ) brought him a cup of tea . It was welcome to his parched throat ; he drank it , and ate a mouthful of the meat to please the man , and even asked for some more tea . At eight four keepers came into his room , undressed him , compelled him to make his toilette , & c. , before them , which put him to shame — being a gentleman — almost as much as it would a woman . They then hobbled him , and fastened his ankles to the bed , and put his hands into muffles , but did not confine his body ; because they had lost a lucrative lodger only a month ago , throttled at night in a strait - waistcoat . Alfred lay in this plight , and compared with anguish unspeakable his joyful anticipations of this night with the strange and cruel reality . “
182447	182675	182230	182230	you	0	” he cried aloud , and burst into a passion of grief . By - and - bye he consoled himself a little with the hope that he could not long be incarcerated as a madman , being sane ; and his good wit told him his only chance was calmness . He would go to sleep and recover composure to bear his wrongs with dignity , and quietly baffle his enemies . Just as he was dropping off ' he felt something crawl over his face . Instinctively he made a violent motion to put his hands up . Both hands were confined ; he could not move them . He bounded , he flung , he writhed . His little persecutors were quiet a moment , but the next they began again . In vain he rolled and writhed , and shuddered with loathing inexpressible . They crawled , they smelt , they bit . Many a poor soul these little wretches had distracted with the very sleeplessness the madhouse professed to cure , not create , in conjunction with the opiates , the confinement and the gloom of Silverton House , they had driven many a feeble mind across the line that divides the weak and nervous from the unsound . When he found there was no help , Alfred clenched his teeth and bore it:—“Bite
182682	182685	182230	182230	you	0	” he said “
182703	182892	182230	182230	you	0	” And they did ; a little . Thus passed the night in mental agony , and bodily irritation and disgust . At daybreak the feasters on his flesh retired , and utterly worn out and exhausted , he sank into a deep sleep . At half - past seven the head keeper and three more came in , and made him dress before them . They handcuffed him , and took him down to breakfast in the noisy ward ; set him down on a little bench by the wall like a naughty boy , and ordered a dangerous maniac to feed him . The dangerous maniac obeyed , and went and sat beside Alfred with a basin of thick gruel and a great wooden spoon . He shovelled the gruel down his charge 's throat mighty superciliously from the very first ; and presently , falling into some favourite and absorbing train of thought , he fixed his eye on vacancy , and handed the spoonfuls over his left shoulder with such rapidity and recklessness that it was more like sowing than feeding . Alfred cried out “
182907	182935	182904	182905	old fellow	8434	” Something in his tone struck the maniac ; he looked at Alfred full , Alfred looked at him in return , and smiled kindly but sadly . “
182938	182943	182904	182905	old fellow	8434	” cried the maniac . “
182949	182955	182904	182905	old fellow	8434	” said a keeper fiercely . “
182968	182977	182978	182978	Saner	5320	” At this there was a horse laugh . “
182980	182985	182978	182978	Saner	5320	” persisted the maniac ; “
182998	182999	182987	182987	I	0	” “
183015	183016	183009	183009	you	0	” “
183029	183030	183009	183009	you	0	” “
183041	183042	183009	183009	you	0	” “
183066	183067	183048	183048	You	0	” “
183072	183096	183097	183097	I	0	” said one of the insulted persons , looking as sly and malicious as a magpie going to steal . Jemmy exploded directly : “
183112	183157	183097	183097	I	0	” and going higher , and higher in this strain , was very soon handcuffed with Alfred 's handcuffs , and seated on Alfred 's bench and tied to two rings in the wall . On this his martial ardour went down to zero : “
183164	183171	183162	183162	sir	1075	” said he piteously to Alfred . “
183209	183265	183189	183189	I	0	” Alfred was now ordered to feed Jemmy ; which he did : so quickly were their parts inverted . Directly after breakfast Alfred demanded to see the proprietor of the asylum . Answer : Does n't live here . The Doctor then . Oh , he has not come . This monstrosity irritated Alfred : “
183270	183274	183189	183189	I	0	” said he , “
183293	183294	183295	183295	I	0	” “
183303	183309	183295	183295	I	0	” said the head keeper , “
183324	183338	183322	183322	him	748	” In five minutes Alfred was handcuffed and flung into a padded room . “
183351	183419	183342	183342	you	5327	” said the head keeper . Alfred walked up and down grinding his teeth with rage for five long hours . Just before dinner Brown came and took him into a parlour , where Mrs. Archbold was seated writing . Brown retired . The lady finished what she was doing , and kept Alfred standing like a schoolboy going to be lectured . At last she said , “
183444	183445	183446	183446	Me	0	” “
183471	183472	183468	183469	somebody here	5334	” “
183499	183521	183524	183524	madam	8503	” In saying these words she was so much more kind and womanly that Alfred conceived hopes , and burst out , “
183565	183678	183679	183679	I	0	” Mrs. Archbold resumed her distant manner without apparent effort : she said nothing , but she placed writing materials before him . She then left the room , and locked him in . He wrote a few hasty ardent words to Julia , telling her how he had been entrapped , but not a word about his sufferings — he was too generous to give her needless pain — and a line to Edward , imploring him to come at once with a lawyer and an honest physician , and liberate him . Mrs. Archbold returned soon after , and he asked her if she would lend him sealing - wax : “
183693	183704	183679	183679	I	0	” said he . She lent him sealing - wax . “
183713	183717	183728	183728	I	0	” said he . “
183733	183768	183728	183728	I	0	” She took him and showed him the box : he put his letters into it , and in the ardour of his gratitude kissed her hand . She winced a little and said , “
183823	183824	183827	183827	you	0	” “
183834	183838	183839	183839	she	5346	” said Alfred ; “
183861	183862	183839	183839	she	5346	” “
183894	183895	183881	183882	a relation	5348	” “
183917	183918	183881	183882	a relation	5348	” “
183962	184023	184026	184026	they	5354	” Alfred could not believe this , but she convinced him that it was so . Then he began to fear he should be imprisoned for years : he turned pale , and looked at her so piteously , that to soothe him she told him sane people were never kept in asylums now ; they only used to be . “
184028	184032	184026	184026	they	5354	” said she . “
184147	184160	184128	184128	you	5361	” She then fixed her large grey eyes on him and said , “
184194	184209	184210	184210	I	0	” Alfred hesitated at that . Her eye dissected his character all the time . “
184213	184223	184210	184210	I	0	” said he at last with a deep sigh . “
184243	184244	184240	184241	mad people	5366	” “
184257	184486	184254	184254	their	5366	” said Mrs. Archbold , just like a matronly sister admonishing a brother from school . She then whistled in a whisper for Brown , who was lurking about unseen all the time . He emerged and walked about with Alfred , and by - and - bye , looking down from a corridor , they saw Mrs. Archbold driving the second - class women before her to dinner like a flock of animals . Whenever one stopped to look at anything , or try and gossip , the philanthropic Archbold went at her just like a shepherd 's dog at a refractory sheep , caught her by the shoulders , and drove her squeaking headlong . At dinner Alfred was so fortunate as to sit opposite a gentleman , who nodded and grinned at him all dinner with a horrible leer . He could not , however , enjoy this to the full for a little distraction at his elbow : his right hand neighbour kept forking pieces out of his plate and substituting others from his own . There was even a tendency to gristle in the latter . Alfred remonstrated gently at first ; the gentleman forbore a minute , then recommenced . Alfred laid a hand very quietly on his wrist and put it back . Mrs. Archbold 's quick eye surprised this gesture : “
184493	184497	184503	184503	madam	8503	” said she . “
184505	184509	184503	184503	madam	8503	” replied Alfred ; “
184528	184529	184525	184525	his	4947	” “
184533	184588	184530	184531	Mr. Cooper	749	” said the Archbold sternly . Cooper , the head keeper , pounced on the offender , seized him roughly by the collar , dragged him from the table , knocking his chair down , and bundled him out of the room with ignominy and fracas , in spite of a remonstrance from Alfred , “
184601	184617	184530	184531	Mr. Cooper	749	” Then the novice laid down his knife and fork , and ate no more . “
184634	184979	184618	184618	I	0	” said he when all was quiet . The company stared considerably at this remark : it seemed to them a most morbid perversion of sensibility ; for the deranged , thin - skinned beyond conception in their own persons , and alive to the shadow of the shade of a wrong , are stoically indifferent to the woes of others . Though Alfred was quiet as a lamb all day , the attendants returned him to the padded room at night , because he had been there last night . But they only fastened one ankle to the bed - post : so he encountered his Lilliputians on tolerably fair terms — numbers excepted : they swarmed . Unable to sleep , he put out his hand and groped for his clothes . But they were outside the door , according to rule . Day broke at last : and he took his breakfast quietly with the first - class patients . It consisted of cool tea in small basins instead of cups , and table - spoons instead of tea - spoons ; and thick slices of stale bread thinly buttered . A few patients had gruel or porridge instead of tea . After breakfast Alfred sat in the first - class patients ' room and counted the minutes and the hours till Edward should come . After dinner he counted the hours till tea - time . Nobody came ; and he went to bed in such grief and disappointment as some men live to eighty without ever knowing . But when two o'clock came next day , and no Edward , and no reply , then the distress of his soul deepened . He implored Mrs. Archbold to tell him what was the cause . She shook her head and said gravely , it was but too common ; a man 's nearest and dearest were very apt to hold aloof from him the moment he was put into an asylum . Here an old lady put in her word . “
185106	185118	185101	185102	the postman	5380	” The Archbold bent her bushy brows on this chatty personage . “
185148	185201	185202	185203	Mr. Baker	748	” The poor old woman was shut up like a knife ; for the Archbold had a way of addressing her own sex that crushed them . The change was almost comically sudden to the mellow tones in which she addressed Alfred the very next moment , on the very same subject : “
185284	185502	185273	185273	He	748	” Alfred promised to be calm ; and she got him an interview with Mr. Baker . He was a full - blown pawnbroker of Silverton town , whom the legislature , with that keen knowledge of human nature which marks the British senate , permitted , and still permits , to speculate in Insanity , stipulating , however , that the upper servant of all in his asylum should be a doctor ; but omitting to provide against the instant dismissal of the said doctor should he go and rob his employer of a lodger — by curing a patient . As you are not the British legislature , I need not tell you that to this pawnbroker insanity mattered nothing , nor sanity : his trade lay in catching , and keeping , and stinting , as many lodgers , sane or insane , as he could hold . There are certain formulae in these quiet retreats , which naturally impose upon greenhorns such as Alfred certainly was , and some visiting justices and lunacy commissioners would seem to be . Baker had been a lodging - house keeper for certified people many years , and knew all the formulae : some call them dodges : but these must surely be vulgar minds . Baker worked “
185509	185510	185273	185273	He	748	” “
185516	185520	185273	185273	He	748	” said he : “
185550	185556	185557	185557	He	8653	” Alfred demanded the doctor . “
185561	185609	185557	185557	He	8653	” was the reply . ( Formula . ) Alfred found it as hard to be calm as some people find it easy to say that word over the wrongs of others . The next day , but not till the afternoon , he caught the doctor : “
185628	185629	185617	185617	you	1075	” “
185635	185648	185630	185630	I	0	” said the doctor , as if scandalised at the very idea . “
185680	185681	185682	185682	He	8653	” “
185689	185690	185682	185682	He	8653	” “
185697	185698	185691	185691	You	1075	” “
185727	185735	185736	185736	You	1075	” The doctor parried with a formula . “
185760	185799	185752	185752	you	1075	” All Alfred obtained by this interview was a powerful opiate . The head - keeper brought it him in bed . He declined to take it . The man whistled , and the room filled with keepers . “
185802	185806	185846	185847	The doctor	8653	” said Cooper , “
185822	185823	185824	185824	You	1075	” “
185832	185836	185837	185838	the doctor	8653	” said Brown ; “
185844	185845	185846	185847	The doctor	8653	” “
185859	185860	185854	185855	the doctor	8653	” “
185865	185866	185867	185867	He	8653	” “
185873	185885	185867	185867	He	8653	” said Alfred . Then fixing his eyes sternly on Cooper , “
185907	185948	185867	185867	He	8653	” Then ensued a struggle , on which I draw a veil : but numbers won the day , with the help of handcuffs and a cowhorn . Brown went and told Mrs. Archbold , and what Alfred had said . “
185954	185962	185867	185867	He	8653	” said that strong - minded lady : “
186001	186044	185993	185993	him	4750	” About midnight Alfred was seized with a violent headache and fever : towards morning he was light - headed , and Brown found him loud and incoherent : only he returned often to an expression Mr. Brown had never heard before — “
186054	186130	186131	186131	I	0	” Most people dislike new phrases . Brown ran to consult Mrs. Archbold about this one . After the delay inseparable from her sex , she came in a morning wrapper ; and they found Alfred leaning over the bed and bleeding violently at the nose . They were a good deal alarmed , and tried to stop it : but Alfred was quite sensible now , and told them it was doing him good . “
186138	186142	186131	186131	I	0	” he said ; “
186154	186231	186232	186232	Brown	746	” They unstrapped his ankle and made him comfortable , and Mrs. Archbold sent Brown for a cup of strong coffee and a glass of brandy . He tossed them off ; and soon after fell into a deep sleep that lasted till tea - time . This sleep the poor doctor ascribed to the sedative effect of his opiate . It was the natural exhaustion consequent on the morbid excitement caused by his cursed opiate . “
186234	186239	186232	186232	Brown	746	” said Mrs. Archbold , “
186265	186604	186250	186250	He	751	” This was a shrewd , but uncharitable , speech of hers . Dr. Bailey was not such a villain as that . He was a less depraved , and more dangerous animal : he was a fool . The farrago he had administered would have done an excited maniac no good , of course , but no great harm . It was dangerous to a sane man : and Alfred to the naked eye was a sane man . But then Bailey had no naked eye left : he had been twenty years an M. D. The certificates of Wycherley and Speers were the green spectacles he wore — very green ones — whenever he looked at Alfred Hardie . Perhaps in time he will forget those certificates , and , on his spectacles dropping off , he will see Alfred is sane . If he does , he will publish him as one of his most remarkable cures . Meanwhile the whole treatment of this ill - starred young gentleman gravitated towards insanity . The inner mind was exasperated by barefaced injustice and oppression ; above all , by his letters being stopped ; for that convinced him both Baker and Bailey , with their see - saw evasions , knew he was sane , and dreaded a visit from honest , understanding men : and the mind 's external organ , the brain , which an asylum professes to soothe , was steadily undermined by artificial sleeplessness . A man ca n't sleep in irons till he is used to them and , when Alfred was relieved of these , his sleep was still driven away by biting insects and barking dogs , two opiates provided in many of these placid Retreats , with a view to the permanence rather than the comfort of the lodgers . On the eighth day Alfred succeeded at last in an object he had steadily pursued for some time : he caught the two see - saw humbugs together . “
186607	186611	186612	186612	you	5403	” said he , “
186634	186646	186620	186620	he	5404	” They were staggered , and he followed up his advantage : “
186655	186659	186620	186620	he	5404	” said he . “
186743	186751	186708	186708	you	1264	” The doctor parried with a formula . “
186766	186904	186905	186905	Doctor	8892	” Now , an asylum is a place not entirely exempt from prejudices : and one of them is , that any sort of appeal to God Almighty is a sign or else forerunner of maniacal excitement . These philosophers forget that by stopping letters , evading public trials , and , in a word , cutting off all appeals to human justice , they compel the patient to turn his despairing eyes , and lift his despairing voice to Him , whose eye alone can ever really penetrate these dark abodes . However , the patient who appealed to God above a whisper in Silverton Grove House used to get soothed directly . And the tranquillising influences employed were morphia , croton oil , or a blister . The keeper came to Alfred in his room . “
186911	186912	186905	186905	Doctor	8892	” “
186921	186922	186923	186923	He	5407	” “
186927	187107	186923	186923	He	5407	” This way of ordering torture , and then coolly going , irritated Alfred beyond endurance . Though he knew he should soon be powerless , he showed fight ; made his mark as usual on a couple of his zealous attendants ; but not having room to work in was soon overpowered , hobbled , and handcuffed : then they cut off his hair , and put a large blister on the top of his head . The obstinate brute declined to go mad . They began to respect him for this tenacity of purpose : a decent bedroom was allotted him ; his portmanteau and bag were brought him , and he was let walk every day on the lawn with a keeper ; only there were no ladders left about , and the trap - door was locked , i.e. the iron gate . On one of these occasions he heard the gatekeeper whistle three times consecutively ; his attendant followed suit , and hurried Alfred into the house , which soon rang with treble signals . “
187112	187116	187117	187119	The visiting justices	5408	” inquired Alfred . “
187131	187132	187135	187135	I	0	” “
187139	187471	187135	187135	I	0	” said Alfred , affecting cheerful compliance , and the man ran off . The whole house was in a furious bustle . All the hobbles , and chains , and instruments of restraint were hastily collected and bundled out of sight , and clean sheets were being put on many a filthy bed whose occupant had never slept in sheets since he came there , when two justices arrived and were shown into the drawing - room . During the few minutes they were detained there by Mrs. Archbold , who was mistress of her whole business , quite a new face was put on everything and everybody ; ancient cobwebs fell ; soap and water explored unwonted territories : the harshest attendants began practising pleasant looks and kind words on the patients , to get into the way of it , so that it might not come too abrupt and startle the patients visibly under the visitors ' eyes : something like actors working up a factitious sentiment at the wing for the public display , or like a racehorse 's preliminary canter . Alfred 's heart beat with joy inexpressible . He had only to keep calm , and this was his last day at Silverton Grove . The first thing he did was to make a careful toilet . The stinginess of relations , and the greed of madhouse proprietors , make many a patient look ten times madder than he is , by means of dress . Clothes wear out in an asylum , and are not always taken off , though Agriculture has long and justly claimed them for her own . And when it is no longer possible to refuse the Reverend Mad Tom or Mrs. Crazy Jane some new raiment , then consanguineous munificence does not go to Pool or Elise , but oftener to paternal or maternal wardrobes , and even to the ancestral chest , the old oak one , singing : “
187492	187807	187135	187135	I	0	” ( Formula . ) This arrangement keeps the bump of self - esteem down , especially in women , and so co - operates with many other little arrangements to perpetuate the lodger . Silverton Grove in particular was supplied with the grotesque in dress from an inexhaustible source . Whenever money was sent Baker to buy a patient a suit , he went from his lunacy shop to his pawnbroker 's , dived headlong into unredeemed pledges , dressed his patient as gentlemen are dressed to reside in cherry - trees ; and pocketed five hundred per cent . on the double transaction . Now Alfred had already observed that many of the patients looked madder than they were — thanks to short trousers and petticoats , holey gloves , ear - cutting shirt - collars , frilled bosoms , shoes made for and declined by the very infantry : coats short in the waist and long in the sleeves , coalscuttle bonnets , and grand - maternal caps . So he made his toilet with care , and put his best hat on to hide his shaven crown . He then kept his door ajar , and waited for a chance of speaking to the justices . One soon came : a portly old gentleman , with a rubicund face and honest eye , walked slowly along the corridor , looking as wise as he could , cringed on by Cooper and Dr. Bailey ; the latter had arrived post haste , and Baker had been sent for . Alfred came out , touched his hat respectfully , and begged a private interview with the magistrate . The old gentleman bowed politely , for Alfred 's dress , address , and countenance , left no suspicion of insanity possible in an unprejudiced mind . But the doctor whispered in his ear , “
187815	187907	187908	187910	An honest man	1570	” Now this is one of the most effective of the formulae in a private asylum . How can an inexperienced stranger know for certain that such a statement is a falsehood ? And even the just do not love justice — to others — quite so well as they love their own skins . So Squire Tollett very naturally declined a private interview with Alfred ; and even drew back a step , and felt uneasy at being so near him . Alfred implored him not to be imposed upon . “
187915	187919	187908	187910	An honest man	1570	” said he . “
187974	187975	187998	187998	you	5415	” “
187984	187995	187981	187982	Mr. Hardie	312	” put in the doctor parentally . ( Formula . ) “
188048	188057	188046	188046	sir	1075	” said he , turning to the justice , “
188236	188241	188224	188224	I	0	” Dr. Bailey said , “
188257	188262	188224	188224	I	0	” ( Formula . ) “
188275	188332	188333	188333	Sir	1075	” was the prompt reply . Mr. Tollett said he thought the patient had a legal right to a commission of lunacy if there was property , and he took note of the application . He then asked Alfred if he had any complaint to make of the food , the beds , or the attendants . “
188335	188339	188333	188333	Sir	1075	” said Alfred , “
188371	188372	188360	188360	I	0	” “
188386	188387	188377	188377	you	1075	” “
188420	188421	188397	188397	I	0	” “
188430	188435	188397	188397	I	0	” said Mr. Tollett . “
188448	188468	188469	188469	He	5444	” With this promise Alfred was obliged to be content . He retired respectfully , and the justice said , “
188477	188530	188469	188469	He	5444	” The doctor smiled . The justice observed it , and not aware that this smile was a formula , as much so as a prizefighter 's or a ballet - dancer 's , began to doubt a little : He reflected a moment , then asked who had signed the certificates . “
188536	188537	188531	188532	Dr. Wycherley	659	” “
188547	188548	188538	188539	Dr. Wycherley	659	” “
188559	188560	188557	188557	sir	1075	” “
188575	188576	188567	188567	he	5444	” “
188596	188601	188590	188594	a more quiet gentlemanly creature	5448	” ( Formula . ) “
188605	188606	188590	188594	a more quiet gentlemanly creature	5448	” “
188636	188637	188626	188626	you	1075	” “
188646	189185	188626	188626	you	1075	” The inspection then continued : the inspector admired the clean sheets that covered the beds , all of them dirty , some filthy : and asked the more reasonable patients to speak freely and say if they had any complaint to make . This question being , with the usual sagacity of public inspectors , put in the presence of Cooper and the doctor , who stuck to Tollett like wax , the mad people all declared they were very kindly treated . The reason they were so unanimous was this : they knew by experience that , if they told the truth , the justices could not at once remedy their discomforts , whereas the keepers , the very moment the justices left the house , would knock them down , beat them , shake them , strait - jacket them , and starve them : and the doctor , less merciful , would doctor them . So they shook in their shoes , and vowed they were very comfortable in Silverton Grove . Thus , in later days , certain Commissioners of Lunacy inspecting Accomb House , extracted nothing from Mrs. Turner , but that she was happy and comfortable under the benignant sway of Metcalf the mild — there present . It was only by a miracle the public learned the truth , and miracles are rare . Meantime , Alfred had a misgiving . The plausible doctor had now Squire Tollett 's ear , and Tollett was old , and something about him reminded the Oxonian of a trait his friend Horace had detected in old age : He knew there was another justice in the house , but he knew also he should not be allowed to get speech with him , if by cunning or force it could be prevented . He kept his door ajar . Presently Nurse Hannah came bustling along with an apronful of things , and let herself into a vacant room hard by . This Hannah was a young woman with a pretty and rather babyish face , diversified by a thick biceps muscle in her arm that a blacksmith need not have blushed for . And I suspect it was this masculine charm , and not her feminine features , that had won her the confidence of Baker and Co. , and the respect of his female patients : big or little , excited or not excited , there was not one of them this bicipital baby - face could not pin by the wrists , and twist her helpless into a strong - room , or handcuff her unaided in a moment ; and she did it , too , on slight provocation . Nurse Hannah seldom came into Alfred 's part of the house ; but when she did meet him , she generally gave him a kind look in passing ; and he had resolved to speak to her , and try if he could touch her conscience , or move her pity . He saw what she was at , but was too politic to detect her openly and irritate her . He drew back a step , and said softly , “
189193	189194	189190	189190	you	759	” “
189201	189218	189190	189190	you	759	” said she sharply , and came out of the room hastily , and shut it . “
189226	189233	189221	189221	you	5451	” Alfred clasped his hands together . “
189245	189252	189221	189221	you	5451	” She was taken by surprise . “
189258	189265	189266	189266	I	0	” said she in some agitation . “
189272	189273	189266	189266	I	0	” “
189292	189293	189287	189288	the keepers	11600	” “
189299	189303	189304	189304	You	5451	” said Hannah . “
189314	189315	189319	189319	he	8375	” “
189337	189338	189339	189339	I	0	” “
189355	189454	189339	189339	I	0	” And run he did . Alfred was lucky enough to get safe into the noisy ward without being intercepted . And then he encountered a sunburnt gentleman , under thirty , in a riding - coat , with a hunting - whip in his hand : it was Mr. Vane , a Tory squire and large landholder in the county . Now , as Alfred entered at one door , Baker himself came in at the other , and they nearly met at Vane . But Alfred saluted him first , and begged respectfully for an interview . “
189459	189464	189457	189457	sir	1075	” said Mr. Vane . “
189474	189497	189470	189470	he	5463	” whispered Baker . Instantly Mr. Vane 's countenance changed . But this time Alfred overheard the formula , and said quietly : “
189529	189530	189527	189527	yourself	1075	” “
189538	189542	189527	189527	yourself	1075	” said Baker . “
189585	189635	189639	189639	sir	1075	” Alfred 's heart sank : he turned a look of silent agony on Mr. Vane . Mr. Vane , either touched by that look , or irritated by Baker 's pragmatical interference , or perhaps both , looked that person coolly in the face , and said sternly : “
189649	189815	189643	189644	the gentleman	9009	” ALFRED thus encouraged told his story with forced calmness , and without a word too much . Indeed , so clear and telling was the narrative , and the logic so close , that incoherent patients one or two stole up and listened with wonder and a certain dreamy complacency ; the bulk , however , held aloof apathetic : inextricably wrapped in fictitious Autobiography . His story told , Alfred offered the Dodds in evidence that the fourteen thousand pounds was no illusion , and referred to his sister and several friends as witnesses to his sanity , and said the letters he wrote were all stopped in the asylum : and why ? That no honest man or woman might know where he was . He ended by convincing Mr. Vane he was a sane and injured man , and his father a dark designing person . Mr. Vane asked him whether he had any other revelations to make . Alfred replied , “
190344	190345	190348	190349	Mr. Baker	748	” “
190351	190355	190348	190349	Mr. Baker	748	” said Vane , “
190364	190377	190358	190358	you	748	” Baker smiled with admirable composure , and replied with crafty moderation , “
190474	190486	190472	190472	sir	1075	” said he , getting warm , which instantly affected his pronunciations “
190501	190577	190496	190496	I	0	” Delusion is a big word , especially in a mad - house ; it overpowers a visitor 's understanding . Mr. Vane was staggered . Alfred , whose eager eyes were never off his face , saw this with dismay , and feeling that , if he failed in the simpler matter , he should be sure to fail in establishing his sanity , he said with inward anxiety , though with outward calmness , “
190584	190585	190579	190579	we	5499	” “
190591	190600	190579	190579	we	5499	” said Vane . Baker 's countenance fell . “
190612	190628	190629	190629	I	0	” Baker 's countenance brightened up ; he had no fear of their being found . “
190632	190636	190629	190629	I	0	” said Alfred : “
190642	190695	190697	190697	I	0	” Baker grinned with anticipated triumph . Alfred led the way to a bedroom near his own ; and asked Mr. Baker to unlock it . Baker had not the key ; no more had Cooper . The latter was sent for it ; he returned , saying the key was mislaid . “
190700	190704	190697	190697	I	0	” said Alfred . “
190719	190720	190713	190713	I	0	” “
190726	190730	190713	190713	I	0	” said Vane . “
190736	190740	190741	190741	he	1075	” said Cooper ; “
190762	190763	190752	190752	You	1075	” “
190769	190774	190767	190767	Cooper	749	” said Alfred ironically . “
190780	190860	190767	190767	Cooper	749	” said Vane . Cooper went for it , and came back with the key instead . The door was opened , and they all entered . Alfred looked under the bed . The rest stood round it . There was nothing to be seen but a year 's dust Alfred was dumb - foundered , and a cold perspiration began to gather on his brow . He saw at once a false move would be fatal to him . “
190865	190870	190863	190863	sir	1075	” said Vane grimly . “
190875	190942	190767	190767	Cooper	749	” Alfred caught sight of a small cupboard ; he searched it ; it was empty . Baker and Cooper grinned at his delusion quietly , but so that Vane might see that formula . Alfred returned to the bed and shook it . Cooper and Baker left off grinning ; Alfred 's quick eye caught this , and he shook the bed violently , furiously . “
190945	190950	190767	190767	Cooper	749	” said Mr. Vane , “
190956	190957	190767	190767	Cooper	749	” “
190966	191057	190767	190767	Cooper	749	” suggested Baker . Alfred tore off the bed - clothes , and then the mattress . Below the latter was a framework , and below the framework a receptacle about six inches deep , five feet long , and three broad , filled with chains , iron belts , wrist - locks , muffles , and screw - locked hobbles , & c. ; a regular Inquisition . If Baker had descended from the Kemble family , instead of rising from nothing , he could not have acted better . “
191061	191065	190767	190767	Cooper	749	” cried he , “
191083	191112	191113	191113	Sir	1075	” Vane replied only by a look of contempt , and ordered Cooper to go and ask Mr. Tollett to come to him . Alfred improved the interval . “
191115	191119	191113	191113	Sir	1075	” said he , “
191133	191134	191135	191135	They	5509	” “
191148	191476	191142	191142	I	0	” Mr. Tollett came , and the two justices commenced a genuine scrutiny — their first . They went now upon the true method , in which all these dark places ought to be inspected . They did not believe a word ; they suspected everything ; they examined patients apart , detected cruelty , filth and vermin under philanthropic phrases and clean linen ; and the upshot was they reprimanded Baker and the attendants severely , and told him his licence should never be renewed , unless at their next visit the whole asylum was reformed . They ordered all the iron body - belts , chains , leg - locks , wrist - locks , and muffs , to be put into Mr. Tollett 's carriage , and concluded a long inspection by inquiring into Alfred 's sanity : at this inquiry they did not allow Baker to be even present , but only Dr. Bailey . First they read the order ; and found it really was not Alfred 's father who had put him into the asylum . Then they read the certificates , especially Wycherley 's . It accused Alfred of headache , insomnia , nightly visions , a rooted delusion ( pecuniary ) , a sudden aversion to an affectionate father ; and at the doctor 's last visit , a wild look ( formula ) , great excitement , and threats of violence without any provocation to justify them . This overpowered the worthy squires ' understandings to begin . But they proceeded to examine the three books an asylum has to keep by law : the visitor 's book , the case book , and the medical journal . All these were kept with the utmost looseness in Silverton House as indeed they are in the very best of these places . However , by combining the scanty notices in the several books , they arrived at this total : “
191517	191539	191145	191145	my	0	” And some days after came an entry with his initials instead of his name , which was contrary to law . “
191551	191559	191145	191145	my	0	” And a day or two after : “
191569	191594	191145	191145	my	0	” The first entry , however , was enough . The doctor had but seen real facts through his green spectacles , and lo ! “
191597	191598	191145	191145	my	0	” “
191601	191603	191145	191145	my	0	” and “
191608	191629	191145	191145	my	0	” three cardinal points of true mania . Mr. Vane asked Dr. Bailey whether he was better since he came . “
191635	191640	191641	191641	We	5515	” said Dr. Bailey . “
191652	191761	191641	191641	We	5515	” They then sent for Mrs. Archbold , and had a long talk with her , recommending Alfred to her especial care : and , having acted on his judgment and information in the teeth of those who called him insane , turned tail at a doctor 's certificate ; distrusted their eyesight at an unsworn affidavit . Alfred was packing up his things to go away ; bright as a lark . Mrs. Archbold came to him , and told him she had orders to give him every comfort ; and the justices hoped to liberate him at their next visit . The poor wretch turned pale . “
191767	191771	191763	191763	their	5516	” he cried , “
191785	191796	191805	191805	they	5516	” Mrs. Archbold hesitated : but at last she said , “
191812	191844	191801	191801	I	0	” The disappointment was too bitter . The contemptible result of all his patience , self - command , and success , was too heart - breaking . He groaned aloud . “
191861	191872	191857	191859	you cruel woman	5518	” Then he broke down altogether and burst out crying . “
191880	191890	191873	191873	You	0	” he sobbed . Mrs. Archbold quivered at that . “
191897	193314	191893	191893	I	0	” said she , in a strange , soft , moving voice ; then , casting an eloquent look of reproach on him , she went away in visible agitation , and left him sobbing . Once out of his sight she rushed into another room , and there , taking no more notice of a gentle madwoman , its occupant , than of the bed or the table , she sank into a chair , and , throwing her head back with womanly abandon , hid her hand upon her bosom that heaved tempestuously . And soon the tears trickled out of her imperious eyes , and ran unrestrained . The mind of Edith Archbold corresponded with her powerful frame , and bushy brows . Inside this woman all was vigour : strong passions , strong good sense to check or hide them ; strong will to carry them out . And between these mental forces a powerful struggle was raging . She was almost impenetrable to mere personal beauty , and inclined to despise early youth in the other sex ; and six months spent with Alfred in a quiet country house would probably have left her reasonably indifferent to him . But the first day she saw him in Silverton House he broke through her guard , and pierced at once to her depths ; first he terrified her by darting through the window to escape : and terror is a passion . So is pity ; and never in her life had she overflowed with it as when she saw him drawn out of the tank and laid on the grass . If , after all , he was as sane as he looked , that brave high - spirited young creature , who preferred death to the touch of coarse confining hands ! No sooner had he filled her with dismay and pity , than he bounded from the ground before her eyes and fled . She screamed , and hoped he would escape ; she could not help it . Next she saw him fighting alone against seven or eight , and with unheard - of prowess almost beating them . She sat at the window panting , with clenched teeth and hands , and wished him to beat , and admired him , wondered at him . He yielded , but not to them : to her . All the compliments she had ever received were tame compared with this one . It thrilled her vanity . He was like the men she had read of , and never seen : the young knights of chivalry . She glowed all over at him , and detecting herself in time was frightened . Her strong good sense warned her to beware of this youth , who was nine years her junior , yet had stirred her to all her depths in an hour ; and not to see him nor think of him too much . Accordingly she kept clear of him altogether at first . Pity soon put an end to that ; and she protected and advised him , but with a cold and lofty demeanour put on express . What with her kind acts and her cold manner he did not know what to make of her ; and often turned puzzled earnest eyes upon her , as much as to say , Are you really my friend or not ? Once she forgot herself and smiled so tenderly in answer to these imploring eyes , that his hopes rose very high indeed . He flattered himself she would let him out of the asylum before long . That was all Julia 's true lover thought of . A feeling hidden , and not suppressed , often grows fast in a vigorous nature . Mrs. Archbold 's fancy for Alfred was subjected to this dangerous treatment ; and it smouldered , and smouldered , till from a penchant it warmed to a fancy , from a fancy to a passion . But penchant , fancy , or passion , she hid it with such cunning and resolution , that neither Alfred nor even those of her own sex saw it ; nor did a creature even suspect it , except Nurse Hannah ; but her eyes were sharpened by jealousy , for that muscular young virgin was beginning to sigh for him herself , with a gentle timidity that contrasted prettily with her biceps muscle and prowess against her own sex . Mrs. Archbold had more passion than tenderness , but what woman is not to be surprised and softened ? When her young favourite , the greatest fighter she had ever seen , broke down at the end of his gallant effort and began to cry like a girl , her bowels of compassion yearned within her , and she longed to cry with him . She only saved herself from some imprudence by flight , and had her cry alone . After a flow of tears , such a woman is invincible ; she treated Alfred at tea - time with remarkable coldness and reserve . This piece of acting led to unlooked - for consequences : it emboldened Cooper , who was raging against Alfred for telling the justices , but had forborne from violence for fear of getting the house into a fresh scrape . He now went to the doctor , and asked for a powerful drastic . Bailey gave him two pills , or rather boluses , containing croton oil — inter alia ; for Bailey was one of the farraginous fools of the unscientific science . Armed with this weapon of destruction , Cooper entered Alfred 's bedroom at night , and ordered him to take them : he refused . Cooper whistled , and four attendants came . Alfred knew he should soon be powerless . He lost no time , sprang at Cooper , and with his long arm landed a blow that knocked him against the wall , and in this position , where his body could not give , struck him again with his whole soul , and cut his cheek right open . The next minute he was pinned , handcuffed , and in a straitjacket , after crippling one assailant with a kick on the knee . Cooper , half stunned , and bleeding like a pig , recovered himself now , and burned for revenge . He uttered a frightful oath , and jumped on Alfred as he lay bound and powerless , and gave him a lesson he never forgot . Every art has its secrets : the attendants in such madhouses as this have been for years possessed of one they are too modest to reveal to justices , commissioners , or the public ; the art of breaking a man 's ribs , or breast - bone , or both , without bruising him externally . The convicts at Toulon arrive at a similar result by another branch of the art : they stuff the skin of a conger eel with powdered stone ; then give the obnoxious person a sly crack with it ; and a rib backbone is broken with no contusion to mark the external violence used . But Mr. Cooper and his fellows do their work with the knee - joint : it is round , and leaves no bruise . They subdue the patient by walking up and down him on their knees . If they do n't jump on him , as well as promenade him , the man 's spirit is often the only thing broken ; if they do , the man is apt to be broken bodily as well as mentally . Thus died Mr. Sizer in 1854 , and two others quite recently . And how many more God only knows : we ca n't count the stones at the bottom of a dark well . Cooper then sprang furiously on Alfred , and went kneeling up and down him . Cooper was a heavy man , and his weight crushed and hurt the victim 's legs ; but that was a trifle : as often as he kneeled on Alfred 's chest , the crushed one 's whole framework seemed giving way , and he could scarcely breathe . But Brown drew Cooper back by the collar , saying , “
193321	193428	193429	193429	We	5520	” And at this moment Mrs. Archbold , who was on the watch , came in with Hannah and another nurse , and the three women at a word from their leader pinned Cooper simultaneously , and , taking him at a disadvantage , handcuffed him in a moment with a strength , sharpness , skill , and determination not to be found in women out of a madhouse — luckily for the newspaper husbands . The other keepers looked astounded at this masterstroke ; but , as no servant had ever affronted Mrs. Archbold without being dismissed directly , they took their cue and said , “
193443	193444	193445	193445	Cooper	749	” “
193447	193459	193445	193445	Cooper	749	” said Mrs. Archbold as soon as she recovered her breath , “
193478	193544	193475	193475	I	0	” Cooper , cowed in a moment by the handcuffs , began to whine and say that it was all Alfred 's fault . But Mrs. Archbold was now carried away by two passions instead of one , and they were together too much for prudence . She took a handful of glossy locks out of her bosom and shook them in Cooper 's face . “
193548	193552	193475	193475	I	0	” said she ; “
193567	193602	193475	193475	I	0	” The two young nurses assented loudly , and turned and cackled at Cooper for cutting off such lovely hair . He shrugged his shoulders at them , and said sulkily to Mrs. Archbold , “
193639	193684	193716	193717	the coroner	1758	” At this brutal speech , all the more intolerable for not being quite false , Mrs. Archbold turned ashy pale , and looked round for a weapon to strike him dead ; but found none so handy and so deadly as her tongue . “
193696	193700	193690	193690	you	749	” said she . “
193757	193799	193750	193750	I	0	” Cooper turned very pale and was silent ; his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth . But a feeble , unexpected voice issued from the bed and murmured cheerfully , though with some difficulty , a single word — “
193802	193820	193821	193821	You	749	” At an expression so out of place they all started with surprise . Alfred went on : “
193854	193855	193841	193841	Cooper	749	” “
193867	193898	193859	193860	the wretch	1334	” said Mrs. Archbold , turning on Alfred with flashing eyes . Her blood once up , she was ready to quarrel even with him for taking part against himself . “
193921	193926	193900	193900	he	1334	” replied Alfred soberly . “
193943	193955	193932	193932	him	1334	” She did n't mind so much about his side ribs . “
193958	193962	193932	193932	him	1334	” replied Alfred . “
194100	194181	194084	194086	dear Mrs. Archbold	742	” At this extraordinary and , if I may be allowed the expression , Alfredian speech , the men first stared , and then laughed ; the women smiled , and then were nearer crying than laughing . And so it was , that justice handcuffed , straitjacketed , blistered , and impartial , sent from its bed of torture a beam through Cooper 's tough hide to his inner heart . He hung his head and stepped towards Alfred : “
194190	194194	194182	194182	You	0	” he said . “
194322	194323	194324	194324	I	0	” “
194332	194338	194324	194324	I	0	” said Mrs. Archbold sharply . “
194347	194392	194345	194345	Hannah	759	” And Baby - face biceps at a look took off his handcuffs ; which she had been prominent in putting on . This extraordinary scene ended in the men being dismissed , and the women remaining and going to work after their kind . “
194402	194406	194345	194345	Hannah	759	” said Hannah . “
194427	194428	194425	194425	Jane	276	” “
194435	194439	194425	194425	Jane	276	” cried Alfred ; “
194443	194567	194425	194425	Jane	276	” Hannah ran for a chair , Jane for another pillow . Mrs. Archbold took off his handcuffs , and , passing her hand softly and caressingly over his head , lamented the loss of his poor hair . Amongst them they relieved him of his straitjacket , set up his head , covered his feet , and he slept like a top for want of drastics and opiates , and in spite of some brilliant charges by the Lilliputian cavalry . After this the attendants never molested Alfred again ; nor did the doctor ; for Mrs. Archbold got his boluses , and sent them up to a famous analysing chemist in London , and told him she had ; and said , “
194583	194878	194568	194568	I	0	” He took the lady 's prescription , coming as it did in a voice quietly grim , and with a momentary but wicked glance shot from under her black brows . Alfred was all the more miserable at his confinement : his melancholy deepened now there was no fighting to excite him . A handsome bright young face clouded with sadness is very pitiable , and I need not say that both the women who had fallen in love with him had their eyes , or at least the tails of their eyes , for ever on his face . The result varied with the characters of the watchers . That young face , ever sad , made Mrs. Archbold sigh , and long to make him happy under her wing . How it wrought on the purer and more womanly Hannah will be revealed by the incident I have to relate . Alfred was sitting on a bench in the corridor bowed down by grief , and the Archbold lurking in a room hard by , feasting her eyes on him through an aperture in the door caused by the inspection plate being under repair — when an erotic maniac was driven past . She had obtained access — with marvellous cunning — to the men 's side ; but was now coming back with a flea in her ear , and faster than she went ; being handcuffed and propelled by Baby - face biceps . On passing the disconsolate Alfred the latter eyed him coyly , gave her stray sheep a coarse push — as one pushes a thing — and laid a timid hand , gentle as falling down , upon the rougher sex . Contrast sudden and funny . “
194887	194898	194885	194885	sir	1075	” she murmured , cooing like the gentlest of doves . “
194910	194925	194899	194899	I	0	” Alfred looked up , and met her full with his mournful honest eyes . “
194946	194947	194899	194899	I	0	” “
194963	194964	194961	194961	herself	742	” “
195089	195101	195082	195082	I	0	” Hannah clasped her hands , with tears in her eyes : “
195106	195110	195082	195082	I	0	” she cried ; “
195141	195142	195130	195130	Brown	746	” “
195151	195152	195145	195145	him	746	” “
195167	195168	195169	195169	I	0	” “
195181	195191	195158	195158	they	5556	” For Baby - face was beginning to whimper . “
195230	195231	195217	195217	you	759	” “
195262	195263	195270	195270	your	1075	” “
195273	195277	195270	195270	your	1075	” sobbed Hannah , “
195289	195293	195294	195294	I	0	” said she : “
195314	195323	195294	195294	I	0	” said she again , and never moved . “
195332	195337	195328	195328	you	1075	” cried Alfred gaily . “
195378	195506	195507	195507	You	5563	” He took out a white handkerchief and dried her cheeks gently for her , and gave her a parting kiss . But the Archbold 's patience was exhausted : a door opened nearly opposite , and there she stood yellow with jealousy and sombre as night with her ebon brows . At sight of this lowering figure Hannah uttered a squawk , and fled with cheeks red as fire . Alfred , not aware of Mrs. Archbold 's smouldering passion , and little dreaming that jealous anguish and rage stood incarnate before him , burst out laughing like a mischievous boy ! On this she swept upon him , and took him by both shoulders , and awed him with her lowering brows close to his . “
195511	195523	195507	195507	You	5563	” she said violently , and panted . His colour rose . “
195539	195540	195534	195534	you	5563	” “
195581	195592	195575	195575	you	5563	” This was the way to wound the generous youth . “
195601	195605	195596	195596	you	5563	” he said . “
195642	195643	195637	195637	you	5563	” “
195654	195673	195674	195674	She	1616	” said the Archbold , clenching her teeth as if the word stung her , like the sight . “
195680	195684	195674	195674	She	1616	” said Alfred ; “
195691	195692	195687	195687	I	0	” “
195704	195705	195695	195695	you	0	” “
195736	195737	195729	195729	nobody	8583	” “
195747	195806	195738	195738	She	1616	” At this insult Alfred rose pale with anger , and was about to defy his monitor mortally ; but the quick - witted woman saw and disarmed him . In one moment , before ever he could speak , she was a transformed creature , a penitent ; she put her hands together supplicatingly , and murmured — “
195837	195878	195835	195835	me	0	” And behold she held his hand between her soft , burning palms , and her proud head sank languidly on his shoulder , and the inevitable tears ran gently . Morals apart , it was glorious love - making . “
195883	195887	195880	195881	the woman	3812	” thought Alfred . “
195896	195900	195880	195881	the woman	3812	” she murmured , “
195907	195908	195880	195881	the woman	3812	” “
195929	195930	195919	195919	I	0	” “
195948	195980	195981	195981	you	0	” She kissed Alfred 's hand gently , and rose to her feet and moved away ; but at the second step turned her head sudden as a bird and finished her sentence—“if
195994	196205	196206	196206	My	0	” Here was a fresh complication ! The men had left off blistering , torturing , and bullying him ; but his guardian angels , the women , were turning up their sleeves to pull caps over him , and plenty of the random scratches would fall on him . If anything could have made him pine more to be out of the horrid place , this voluptuous prospect would . He hunted everywhere for Brown . But he was away the day with a patient . At night he lay awake for a long time , thinking how he should open the negotiation . He shrank from it . He felt a delicacy about bribing Beelzebub 's servant to betray him . As Hannah had originated the idea , he thought he might very well ask her to do the dirty work of bribing Brown , and he would pay her for it ; only in money , not kisses . With this resolution he sank to sleep , and his spirit broke prison : he stood with Julia before the altar , and the priest made them one . Then the church and the company and daylight disappeared , and her own sweet low moving voice came thrilling , “
196213	196217	196206	196206	My	0	” she murmured . “
196232	196356	196358	196358	her	5578	” and with this her sweet lips settled on his like the dew . Impartial sleep flies at the steps of the scaffold and the gate of Elysium : so Alfred awoke at the above ; but doubted whether he was quite awake ; for two velvet lips seemed to be still touching his . He stirred , and somebody was gone like the wind , with a rustle of flying petticoats , and his door shut in a moment . It closed with a catch - lock ; this dastardly vision had opened it with her key , and left it open to make good her retreat if he should awake . Alfred sat up in bed indignant , and somewhat fluttered . “
196361	196502	196358	196358	her	5578	” said he . But there was no help for it ; he grinned and bore it , as he had the blisters , and boluses , & c. , rolled the clothes round his shoulders , and off to the sleep of the just again . Not so the passionate hypocrite , who , maddened by a paroxysm of jealousy , had taken this cowardly advantage of a prisoner . She had sucked fresh poison from those honest lips , and filled her veins with molten fire . She tossed and turned the livelong night in a high fever of passion , nor were the cold chills wanting of shame and fear at what she had done . In the morning , Alfred remembered this substantial vision , and determined to find out which of those two it was . “
196510	196514	196515	196515	she	5578	” said he ; “
196525	196548	196515	196515	she	5578	” Well , the first he saw was Mrs. Archbold . She met his eye full with a mild and pensive dignity . “
196556	196585	196554	196554	you	5579	” thought Alfred . Presently he fell in with Hannah . She wore a serene , infantine face , the picture of unobtrusive modesty . Alfred was dumbfoundered . “
196594	196598	196606	196606	her	5578	” said he . “
196613	196680	196606	196606	her	5578	” However , he did not speak to her ; he was looking out for a face that interested him far more : the weather - beaten countenance of Giles Brown . He saw him once or twice , but could not get him alone till the afternoon . He invited him into his room : and when he got him there , lost no time . “
196690	196702	196688	196688	Brown	769	” said he quietly . Brown looked him in the face . “
196713	196723	196688	196688	Brown	769	” Brown turned his head away . Alfred laughed . “
196745	196750	196751	196751	I	0	” The man coloured . “
196770	196771	196772	196772	I	0	” “
196791	196792	196783	196783	I	0	” “
196817	196818	196815	196815	you	1075	” “
196844	196845	196846	196846	My	0	” “
196859	196860	196849	196849	I	0	” “
196872	196873	196864	196864	I	0	” “
196885	196886	196864	196864	I	0	” “
196912	196913	196903	196903	I	0	” “
196935	196936	196916	196916	you	769	” “
196969	196970	196954	196954	you	769	” “
196977	196987	196954	196954	you	769	” said Brown , with an accent of conviction . “
197039	197051	197052	197052	Your	746	” This was a sad disappointment ; so sudden , too . “
197055	197060	197064	197064	you	769	” said Alfred ruefully . “
197067	197068	197064	197064	you	769	” “
197104	197119	197101	197101	your	769	” Alfred stared with amazement . Brown continued , and now with some emotion : “
197186	197187	197175	197175	you	769	” “
197192	197197	197175	197175	you	769	” said Alfred cordially . “
197230	197239	197221	197221	I	0	” He reflected a moment then burst out : “
197382	197392	197370	197370	she	759	” Brown was overpowered by his maniac 's logic . “
197398	197402	197393	197393	You	746	” said he ; “
197419	197454	197458	197458	I	0	” They now put their heads together over the means . Brown 's plan was to wait , and wait , for an opportunity . Alfred 's was to make one this very night . “
197460	197464	197465	197465	I	0	” said Brown . “
197487	197488	197490	197490	Hannah	759	” “
197493	197494	197495	197495	Hannah	759	” “
197509	197510	197514	197514	she	759	” “
197524	197525	197514	197514	she	759	” “
197534	197561	197514	197514	she	759	” said Brown suspiciously . Alfred did n't know what to say : he could not tell him why he felt sure she had a key . “
197570	197574	197578	197578	her	759	” said he : “
197585	197636	197579	197579	I	0	” Brown obeyed , and returned in half - an - hour with the key of the vacant bedroom , where the hobbles and chains were hidden on the arrival of the justices . She tells me this is the only key she has of any room in this corridor . “
197641	197645	197579	197579	I	0	” said Brown , “
197728	197740	197719	197719	She	759	” Alfred coloured up . He suspected he had been unjust . “
197753	197757	197741	197741	She	759	” said he ; “
197767	198082	197741	197741	She	759	” It was evident by the alacrity Brown now showed , that he had got his orders from Hannah . It was agreed that Alfred should be down at night in his clothes , ready to seize the right moment ; that Hannah should get the key , and watch the coast clear , and let him out into the corridor ; and Brown get him down by a back stairs , and out on the lawn , There he would find a ladder close by the wall , and his own arms and legs must do the rest . And now Alfred was a changed creature : his eye sparkled ; he walked on air , and already sniffed the air of liberty . After tea Brown brought in some newspapers , and made Alfred a signal , previously agreed on , that the ladder was under the east wall . He went to bed early , put on his tweed shooting - jacket and trousers , and lay listening to the clock with beating heart . At first , feet passed to and fro from time to time . These became less frequent as the night wore on . Presently a light foot passed , stopped at the door , and made a sharp scratch on it with some metal instrument . It was the key . The time was not ripe to use it , but good Hannah had taken this way to let him know she had got it . This little scratch outside his door , oh it made his heart leap and thrill . One great difficulty was overcome . He waited , and waited , but with glowing , hopeful heart ; and at last a foot came swiftly , the key turned , and Hannah opened the door . She had a bull's - eye lantern . “
198090	198094	197741	197741	She	759	” she whispered , “
198099	198154	197741	197741	She	759	” He followed her . She led him in and out , to the door of the public room belonging to the second - class patients . Then she drew her whistle , and breathed very softly . Brown answered as softly from the other end . He was waiting at the opposite door . “
198158	198162	197741	197741	She	759	” said she ; “
198169	198183	198253	198253	dear	1054	” She put a key into the door , and said very softly , “
198188	198189	198253	198253	dear	1054	” “
198196	198204	198194	198194	Hannah	759	” said Alfred , with deep emotion . “
198213	198214	198215	198215	He	481	” “
198221	198248	198218	198218	He	481	” said the single - hearted girl , and put her other hand to her breast with a great gulp . She opened the door slowly . “
198262	198372	198255	198255	I	0	” And so these two parted ; for Hannah could not bear the sight of Giles at that moment . He was welcome to Alfred , though , most welcome , and conducted him by devious ways to the kitchen , lantern in hand . He opened the kitchen door softly , and saw two burly strangers seated at the table , eating with all their souls , and Mrs. Archbold standing before the fire , but looking towards him : for she had heard his footsteps ever so far off . The men looked up , and saw Alfred . They rose to their feet , and said , “
198381	198382	198379	198379	madam	8503	” “
198385	198390	198379	198379	madam	8503	” said Mrs. Archbold . “
198396	198403	198379	198379	madam	8503	” said the man very civilly . “
198411	198643	198379	198379	madam	8503	” SAMPSON 'S placard was on Barkington walls , and inside the asylum Alfred was softening hearts and buying consciences , as related ; so , in fact , he had two strings to his bow . But mark how strangely things turn ; these two strings got entangled . His father , alarmed by the placard , had called at the pawnbroker 's shop , and told him he must move Alfred directly to a London asylum . Baker raised objections ; Mr. Hardie crushed them with his purse , i.e. , with his son 's and victim 's sweetheart 's father 's money . So then , as Baker after all could not resist the project , but only postpone it for a day or two , he preferred to take a handsome present , and cooperate . He even connived at Mr. Hardie 's signing the requisite name to the new order . This the giddy world calls forgery ; but , in these calm retreats , far from the public 's inquisitive eye , it goes for nothing . Why , Mrs. Archbold had signed Baker 's name and Dr. Bailey 's more than a hundred several times to orders , statements , and certificates ; depriving Englishmen of their liberty and their property with a gesture of her taper fingers ; and venting the conventional terms , “
198646	198647	198379	198379	madam	8503	” “
198650	198651	198379	198379	madam	8503	” “
198654	198655	198379	198379	madam	8503	” “
198658	198659	198379	198379	madam	8503	” “
198662	198663	198379	198379	madam	8503	” “
198666	198667	198379	198379	madam	8503	” “
198670	198773	198379	198379	madam	8503	” as boldly and blindly as any male starling in the flock . On the very night , then , of Alfred 's projected escape , two keepers came down from Dr. Wycherley 's asylum to Silverton station : Baker met them and drove them to Silverton House in his dog - cart . They were to take Alfred up by the night train ; and , when he came into the kitchen with Brown , they suspected nothing , nor did Baker or Cooper , who presently emerged from the back kitchen . Brown saw , and recovered his wits partially . “
198783	198843	198781	198781	sir	1075	” stammered he , making a shrewd and fortunate guess at what was up . Baker assented ; and soon after went out to get the horse harnessed . On this Mrs. Archbold , pale , sorrowful , and silent hitherto , beckoned Alfred into the back kitchen , and there gave him his watch and his loose money . “
198852	198856	198778	198778	his	5618	” said she ; “
198882	198907	198778	198778	his	5618	” He thanked her somewhat sullenly ; for his disappointment was so deep and bitter that small kindnesses almost irritated him . She sighed . “
198917	198921	198922	198922	I	0	” she said : “
199015	199061	199062	199062	I	0	” She put out both hands as eloquently as she spoke , and overpowered his prudence so far that he took her offered hands — they were as cold now as they were burning hot the last time — and pressed them , and said — “
199072	199081	199062	199062	I	0	” The passionate woman snatched her hands away . “
199089	199093	199094	199094	I	0	” she cried ; “
199105	199116	199094	199094	I	0	” He made no reply . And so they parted . “
199132	199140	199118	199118	you	1075	” asked the pawnbroker on his return . “
199150	199250	199144	199144	you	1075	” replied the prisoner . On this he was handcuffed , and helped into the dog - cart . They went up to town by the midnight train ; but , to Alfred 's astonishment and delight did not take a carriage to themselves . However , station after station was passed , and nobody came into their carriage . At last they stopped at a larger station , and a good many people were on the platform : Alfred took this opportunity and appealed in gentle but moving terms to the first good and intelligent face he saw . “
199253	199257	199258	199258	I	0	” said he , “
199263	199283	199258	199258	I	0	” The gentleman turned courteously to him . The keepers , to Alfred 's surprise , did not interrupt . “
199314	199315	199294	199294	they	5626	” “
199325	199345	199316	199316	You	1075	” said the gentleman . The head keeper instantly showed him the order and a copy of the certificates . “
199354	199358	199316	199316	You	1075	” cried Alfred ; “
199411	199418	199404	199406	those venal rogues	5632	” The gentleman turned cold directly . “
199428	199574	199419	199419	I	0	” said he . The unsworn affidavits had overpowered his senses . He retired with a frigid inclination . Alfred wrung his handcuffed hands , and the connecting chain rattled . The men never complained : his conduct was natural ; and they knew their strength . At the next station he tested a snob 's humanity instead of a gentleman 's . He had heard they were more tender - hearted . The answer was a broad grin , repeated at intervals . Being called mad was pretty much the same thing as being mad to a mind of this class : and Alfred had admitted he was called mad . At the next station he implored a silvery - haired old gentleman . Old age , he had heard , has known griefs , and learned pity . The keeper showed the certificates . “
199577	199581	199582	199584	poor young man	5633	” said Senex ; “
199609	199661	199704	199704	me	0	” And he hobbled away as fast as he could . It is by shirking the painful some live to be silvery old . Next he tried a policeman . Bobby listened to him erect as a dart . The certificates were shown him . He eyed them and said sharply , “
199665	199688	199704	199704	me	0	” Nor could Alfred 's entreaties and appeals to common sense attract a word or even a look from him . Alfred cried “
199706	199725	199704	199704	me	0	” This soon drew a crowd round him , listening to his fiery tale of wrong , and crying “
199734	199915	199731	199731	him	0	” The keepers touched their heads , winked , and got out and showed the certificates ; the crowd melted away like wax before those two suns of evidence ( unsworn ) . The train moved on . It was appalling . How could he ever get free ? Between his mind and that of his fellows there lay a spiritual barrier more impassible than the walls of fortified cities . Yet , at the very next station , with characteristic tenacity of purpose , he tried again ; for he saw a woman standing near , a buxom country woman of forty . Then he remembered that the Naked Eye was not yet an extinct institution among her sex . He told her his tale , and implored her to use her own eyes . She seemed struck , and did eye him far more closely than the men had : and told the keepers they ought to be ashamed of themselves ; he was no madman , for she had seen madmen . They showed her the certificates . “
199923	199928	199929	199929	ye	5638	” said she contemptuously ; “
199941	199955	199938	199938	my	0	” The keeper whipped off Alfred 's cap and showed his shaven crown . “
199962	199970	199959	199959	he	5639	” said she , lowering her tone ; “
199985	200032	199980	199983	a pretty young gentleman	5640	” And after that all he could say only drew the dew of patient pity to her eyes . The train went on , and left her standing there , a statue of negative clemency . Alfred lost heart . He felt how impotent he was . “
200040	200087	200033	200033	I	0	” he said . He shivered in a corner , hating man , and doubting God . They reached Dr. Wycherley 's early in the morning . Alfred was shown into a nice clean bedroom , and asked whether he would like to bathe or sleep . “
200093	200198	200033	200033	I	0	” he said ; and was allowed to bathe himself . He had not been long in the water when Dr. Wycherley 's medical assistant tapped at the door , and then entered without further ceremony — a young gentleman with a longish down on his chin , which , initiated early in the secrets of physiology , he was too knowing to shave off and so go to meet his trouble . He came in looking like a machine , with a note - book in his hand , and stood by the bath side dictating notes to himself and jotting them down . “
200226	200233	200033	200033	I	0	” Alfred turned in the water . “
200257	200258	200033	200033	I	0	” “
200261	200262	200033	200033	I	0	” “
200286	200287	200290	200290	sir	1075	” “
200312	200313	200300	200300	you	1075	” “
200331	200574	200330	200330	I.	0	” He whipped out , and entered the condition of the new patient 's body with jealous minuteness in the case - book . As for his mind , he made no inquiry into that : indeed he was little qualified for researches of the kind . At breakfast Alfred sat with a number of mad ladies and gentlemen , who by firmness , kindness , and routine , had been led into excellent habits : the linen was clean and the food good . He made an excellent meal , and set about escaping : with this view he explored the place . Nobody interfered with him ; but plenty of eyes watched him . The house was on the non - restraint system . He soon found this system was as bad for him as it was good for the insane . Non - restraint implied a great many attendants , and constant vigilance . Moreover , the doors were strong , the windows opened only eight inches , and that from the top : their framework was iron , painted like wood , & c. It was next to impossible to get into the yard at night : and then it looked quite impossible to get any further , for the house was encompassed by high walls . He resigned all hope of escape without connivance . He sounded a keeper ; the man fired at the first word . “
200593	200655	200583	200583	you	1075	” Alfred coloured to the eyes and sighed deeply . To have honour thrown in his face , and made the reason for not aiding him to baffle a dishonourable conspiracy ! But he took the reproof so sweetly , the man was touched , and by - and - bye , seeing him deeply dejected , said good - naturedly , “
200697	200698	200688	200689	the Commissioners	5356	” “
200706	200707	200688	200689	the Commissioners	5356	” “
200730	200731	200734	200734	you	1075	” “
200736	200741	200734	200734	you	1075	” cried Alfred impetuously . “
200758	200759	200755	200755	your	1075	” “
200776	200781	200788	200788	friends	2280	” ( Formula . ) “
200790	200794	200788	200788	friends	2280	” said Alfred : “
200809	200810	200797	200797	you	1075	” “
200832	200924	200925	200925	spies	4661	” Alfred got paper and sketched the letter on which so much depended . It took him six hours . He tore up two ; he cooled down the third , and condensed it severely : by this means , after much thought , he produced a close and telling composition . He also weeded it of every trait and every term he had observed in mad people 's talk , or the letters they had shown him . So there was no incoherency , no heat , no prolixity , no “
200927	200929	200925	200925	spies	4661	” no “
200932	201094	200925	200925	spies	4661	” no italics . A simple , honest , earnest story , with bitter truth stamped on every line ; a sober , strong appeal from a sore heart but hard head to the arbiters of his fate . To the best of my belief no madman , however slightly touched , or however cunning , ever wrote a letter so gentle yet strong , so earnest yet calm , so short yet full , and withal so lucid and cleanly jointed as this was . And I am no contemptible judge ; for I have accumulated during the last few years a large collection of letters from persons deranged in various degrees , and studied them minutely , more minutely than most Psychologicals study anything but Pounds , Shillings , and Verbiage . The letter went , and he hoped but scarcely expected an answer by return of post . It did not come . He said to his heart , “
201098	201138	200925	200925	spies	4661	” and waited . Another day went by ; and another : he gnawed his heart and waited : he pined , and waited on . The Secret Tribunal , which was all a shallow legislature had left him , “
201143	201187	200925	200925	spies	4661	” Secret Tribunals always do . But , while the victim - suitor longed and pined and languished for one sound from the voice of Justice and Humanity , and while the Secret Tribunal , not being in prison itself all this time , “
201192	201288	201289	201291	Insolent interfering fool	5658	” events occurred at Barkington that bade fair to throw open the prison doors and bring father and son , bride and bridegroom , together again under one roof . But at what a price . AT sight of Sampson 's placard Mr. Hardie was seized with a tremor that suspended the razor in mid air : he opened the window , and glared at the doctor 's notice . At this moment he himself was a picture : not unlike those half cleaned portraits the picture restorers hang out as specimens of their art . “
201293	201378	201289	201291	Insolent interfering fool	5658	” he muttered , and began to walk the room in agitation . After a while he made a strong effort , shaved the other half , and dressed slowly , thinking hard all the time . The result was , he went out before breakfast ( which he had not done for years ) , and visited Mr. Baker — for what purpose has been already shown . On his return , Jane was waiting breakfast . The first word to him was : “
201385	201386	201382	201382	you	426	” “
201392	201397	201289	201291	Insolent interfering fool	5658	” said he indifferently . “
201411	201436	201400	201400	I	0	” Jane said it was a very improper and most indelicate interference in their affairs , and went on to say with heightened colour : “
201447	201453	201455	201456	Mr. Hardie	312	“ Not for the world ! ”
201482	201492	201478	201478	he	312	“ I do not wish that Notice interfered with . ”
201493	201507	201509	201509	she	705	“ I should n't think of touching it without your order , sir , ”
201578	201581	201583	201583	he	312	“ Besides , ”
201585	201624	201583	201583	he	312	“ why should you and I burk inquiry ? Ill as he has used me , I am his father , and not altogether without anxiety . Suppose those doctors should be right about him , you know ? ”
201677	201681	201683	201683	he	2217	“ Why not ? ”
201881	201884	201886	201886	she	276	“ But , ”
201888	201949	201886	201886	she	276	“ the reason I repeat these things is to make peace , and that you may not fancy there is any one in our house so cruel , so unchristian , as to approve Alfred 's perfidy . Oh , and papa said candidly he disliked the match , but then he disliked this way of ending it far more . ”
201974	201980	201982	201982	she	276	“ I think , dear , ”
201984	202021	201982	201982	she	276	“ in a day or two she will see you ; but no one else : and for her sake we shall now hurry our departure from this place , where she was once so happy . ”
202126	202130	202097	202098	a gentleman	1065	“ White Lion , ”
202312	202319	202308	202308	she	8315	“ We seem surrounded by mystery . ”
202436	202450	202429	202434	a hungry one at the gate	5698	“ Why : he wanted to begin on an old woman like me . ”
202460	202505	202451	202451	Peggy	705	“ Oh , he begun where most of them ends — if they get so far at all : axed me was I comfortable here ; if not , he knew a young man wanted a nice tidy body to keep house for him . ”
202715	202721	202723	202725	the able mechanic	5699	“ Who could help it ? ”
202739	202747	202749	202749	she	705	“ Not so free , young man , ”
202751	202759	202749	202749	she	705	“ Kissing is the prologue to sin . ”
202760	202767	202769	202771	the able mechanic	5699	“ How do you know that ? ”
202781	202787	202789	202789	Peggy	705	“ It is a saying , ”
203261	203286	203259	203260	Mrs. Dodd	253	sighed—“She goes from one thing to another , but always returns to one idea ; that he is a victim , not a traitor . ”
203287	203303	203259	203260	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Well , tell her in one hour the money shall be in the house . ”
203304	203313	203259	203260	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ The money ! What does she care ? ”
203314	203328	203259	203260	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Well , say we shall know all about Alfred by eleven o'clock . ”
203329	203337	203339	203340	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ My dear friend , be prudent , ”
203342	203359	203339	203340	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ I feel alarmed : you were speaking almost in a whisper when I came in . ”
203360	203388	203259	203260	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Y ' are very obsairvant : but dawnt be uneasy ; we are three to one . Just go and comfort Miss Julee with my message . ”
203389	203396	203397	203397	she	253	“ Ah , that I will , ”
203513	203517	203519	203519	Sampson	357	“ Confound him ! ”
203521	203538	203519	203519	Sampson	357	“ if he does not soon come I shall run away . It is bitterly cold . ”
203715	203717	203718	203718	he	254	there:—“Yes , ”
203780	203783	203785	203785	Green	774	“ Cut that ”
203788	203796	203785	203785	Green	774	“ or you 'll get into trouble . ”
203804	203815	203816	203816	he	312	“ Do not kill me , do not hurt me , ”
203819	203852	203816	203816	he	312	“ I am but a poor man now . Take my little money ; it is in my waistcoat pocket ; but spare my life . You see I do n't resist . ”
203853	203863	203865	203865	Green	774	“ Come , stash your gab , my lad , ”
203885	203900	203865	203865	Green	774	“ It 's not your stiff that is wanted , but Captain Dodd 's . ”
203901	203906	203908	203915	the prisoner with a wonderful assumption of innocence	5730	“ Captain Dodd 's ? ”
203917	203925	203927	203927	Green	774	“ Ay , the pocket - book , ”
203929	203936	203937	203937	He	774	“ here , this ! this ! ”
204153	204159	204172	204173	the prisoner	12083	“ A lot of receipts . ”
204160	204170	204172	204173	the prisoner	12083	“ Of no use to any one but me , ”
204176	204186	204172	204173	the prisoner	12083	“ Two miniatures ; gold rims , pinchbeck backs . ”
204187	204223	204172	204173	the prisoner	12083	“ They are portraits of my children when young : Heaven forgive me , I could not give them up to my creditors : surely , surely , you will not rob me of them . ”
204224	204229	204231	204232	Mr. Green	774	“ Stash your gab , ”
204235	204246	204231	204232	Mr. Green	774	“ Here 's a guinea , Queen Anne 's reign . ”
204247	204296	204172	204173	the prisoner	12083	“ It belonged to my great - grandfather : take it , but you will let me redeem it ; I will give 5l . for it poor as I am : you can leave it on my door - step , and I 'll leave the 5l .. ”
204297	204320	204231	204232	Mr. Green	774	“ Stow your gab . Letters ; papers covered with figures . Stay , what is this ? a lot of memoranda . ”
204321	204340	204172	204173	the prisoner	12083	“ They are of the most private and delicate character . Pray do not expose my family misfortunes . ”
204447	204451	204452	204452	he	774	“ All right , ”
204471	204567	204452	204452	he	774	“ ' This day Alfred told me to my face I had 14,000l . of Captain Dodd 's . We had an angry discussion . What can he mean ? Drs . Wycherley and Osmond , this same day , afflicted me with hints that he is deranged , or partly . I saw no signs of it before . Wrote to my brother entreating him to give me 200l . to replace the sum which I really have wronged this respectable and now most afflicted family of . I had better withdraw — — ' ”
204577	204593	204569	204570	Mr. Hardie	312	“ These are mere family matters ; if you are a man , respect them . ”
204601	204630	204594	204594	Green	774	“ ' Better withdraw my opposition to the marriage , or else it seems my own flesh and blood will go about the place blackening my reputation . ' ”
204638	204676	204631	204632	Mr. Hardie	312	“ I tell you , on my honour as a gentleman , there 's no money there but my grandfather 's guinea . My money is all in my waistcoat pocket , where you will not look . ”
204724	204730	204732	204732	he	312	“ Only eight yellow boys , ”
204783	204787	204789	204790	Mr. Hardie	312	“ I consent , ”
204792	204801	204789	204790	Mr. Hardie	312	“ and thank you for abstaining from violence . ”
204802	204809	204811	204812	Mr. Green	774	“ All right , my tulip , ”
204875	204883	204884	204884	he	774	“ Wait here an hour for me , ”
204887	204918	204884	204884	he	774	“ I must see who liberates him , and whether he is really as innocent as he reads , or we have been countermined by the devil 's own tutor . ”
205025	205028	205030	205031	the Doctor	8653	“ No , ”
205041	205048	205030	205031	the Doctor	8653	“ Do n't know the lad . ”
205053	205074	205076	205076	he	5754	“ There is not many that do know him at all hours ; however , he is here , sir . ”
205216	205221	205223	205223	Green	776	“ Well , sir , ”
205225	205264	205223	205223	Green	776	“ I never was more puzzled in my life , owing to not being near hand when he was untied . It looks all square , however . There 's one little thing that do n't fit somehow . ”
205275	205283	205284	205284	They	5758	“ The sovs . were all marked . ”
205308	205430	205432	205433	the master	2606	“ What , me fake the beans , now I live on this side of the hedge ? Never knew a cove mix his liquors that way but it hurt his health soon or late . No , I took them out of one pocket and felt of them as I slipped them into the other . Ye see , gents , to do any good on my lay , a man must train his senses as well as his mind : he must have a hare 's ear , and a hawk 's eye , a bloodhound 's nose , and a lady 's hand with steel fingers and a silk skin . Now look at that bunch of fives , ”
205450	205594	205432	205433	the master	2606	“ it can put the bracelets on a giant , or find a sharper 's nail - mark on the back of the knave of clubs . The beans were marked . Which it is a small thing , but it do n't fit the rest . Here 's an unsuspicious gent took by surprise , in moonlight meditation fancy free , and all his little private family matters found in his innocent bosom , quite promiscuous ; but his beans marked . That do n't dovetail nohow . Gents , did ever you hear of the man that went to the bottom of the bottomless pit to ease his mind ? Well , he was the head of my family . I must go to the bottom whether there 's one or not . And just now I see but one way . ”
205595	205601	205604	205605	his companions	3626	“ And what is that ? ”
205610	205619	205621	205621	Green	776	“ Oh , I must n't threaten it , ”
205623	205696	205621	205621	Green	776	“ or I shall never have the stomach to do it . But dear me , this boozing ken is a very unfit place for you,—you are champagne - gents , not dog 's nose ones . Now you part and make tracks for home , one on foot and one in a fly . You wo n't see me , nor hear of me again , till I 've something fresh . ”
205741	205745	205747	205747	he	254	“ And indeed , ”
205749	205847	205747	205747	he	254	“ if we had but stopped to reflect , we should have seen how unlikely the money was not to be lost in the Agra . Why , the ' Tiser says she went to pieces almost directly she struck . What we ought to have done was , not to listen to Alfred Hardie like fools , but write to Lloyd 's like people in their senses . I 'll do it this minute , and find out the surviving officers of the ship : they will be able to give us information on that head . ”
205990	206088	205966	205966	Sampson	357	“ Whereas , yesterday evening at ten o'clock Richard Hardie , Esq . , of Musgrove Cottage , Barkington , was assaulted at his own door by three ruffians , who rifled his pockets , and read his private memoranda , and committed other acts of violence , the shock of which has laid him on a bed of sickness , the above reward shall be paid to any person , or persons , who will give such information as shall lead to the detection of all or any one of the miscreants concerned in this outrage . “
206105	206215	206096	206098	Mr. Thomas Hardie	778	” On this the impartial police came to Mr. Hardie 's and made inquiries . He received them in bed , and told them particulars : and they gathered from Peggy that she had heard a cry of distress , and opened the kitchen door , and that Betty and she had ventured out together , and found poor master tied to the gate with an old cord : this she produced , and the police inspected and took it away with them . At sight of that Notice , Edward felt cold and then hot and realised the false and perilous position into which he had been betrayed : “
206225	206229	206096	206098	Mr. Thomas Hardie	778	” he said : “
206238	206711	206714	206714	my	0	” This , and the insult his sister had received made the place poison to him ; and hastened their departure by a day or two . The very next day ( Thursday ) an affiche on the walls of Albion Villa announced that Mr. Chippenham , auctioneer , would sell , next Wednesday , on the premises , the greater part of the furniture , plate , china , glass , Oriental inlaid boxes and screens , with several superb India shawls , scarfs , and dresses ; also a twenty - one years ' lease of the villa , seventeen to run . Edward took unfurnished apartments in London , near Russell Square : a locality in which , as he learned from the ' Tiser , the rooms were large and cheap . He packed just so much furniture as was essential ; no knick - knacks . It was to go by rail on Monday ; Mrs. Dodd and Julia were to follow on Tuesday : Edward to stay at Barkington and look after the sale . Meantime their secret ally , Mr. Green , was preparing his threatened coup . The more he reflected the more he suspected that he had been outwitted by Peggy Black . She had led him on , and the pocket - book had been planted for him . If so , why Peggy was a genius , and in his own line ; and he would marry her , and so kill two birds with one stone : make a Detective of her ( there was a sad lack of female detectives ) ; and , once his wife , she would split on her master , and he should defeat that old soldier at last , and get a handsome slice of the 14,000l .. He manoeuvred thus : first , he went back to London for a day or two to do other jobs , and to let this matter cool ; then he returned , and wrote from a town near Barkington to Peggy Black , telling her he had been sent away suddenly on a job , but his heart had remained behind with his Peggy : would she meet him at the gate at nine that evening ? he had something very particular to say to her . As to the nature of the business , the enclosed would give her a hint . She might name her own day , and the sooner the better . The enclosed was a wedding - ring . At nine this extraordinary pair of lovers met at the gate ; but Peggy seemed hardly at her ease ; said her master would be coming out and catching her ; perhaps they had better walk up the road a bit . “
206717	206730	206714	206714	my	0	” said Green ; but he could not help a little sneer : “
206734	206738	206714	206714	my	0	” said he : “
206755	206756	206752	206752	he	5592	” “
206768	206772	206762	206762	you	0	” said Peggy . “
206782	206783	206773	206773	I	0	” “
206806	206807	206773	206773	I	0	” “
206822	206823	206773	206773	I	0	” “
206836	206837	206773	206773	I	0	” “
206850	206851	206852	206852	You	0	” “
206857	206982	206852	206852	You	0	” murmured Peggy , throwing her skirt over her head — for a drizzle was beginning — and walking slower and slower . Then he made hot love to her , and pressed her hard to name the day . She coquetted with the question till they came near the mouth of a dark lane , called Lovers ' Walk ; then , as he insisted on an answer , she hung her head bashfully , and coughed a little cough . At which preconcerted signal a huge policeman sprang out of the lane and collared Mr. Green . On this Peggy , who was all Lie from head to heel , uttered a little scream of dismay and surprise . Mr. Green laughed . “
206991	206995	206985	206985	you	0	” said he . “
207006	207160	207162	207162	she	5783	” The detective put his hands suddenly inside the policeman 's , caught him by the bosom with his right hand by way of fulcrum ; and with his left by the chin , which he forced violently back , and gave him a slight Cornish trip at the same moment ; down went the policeman on the back of his head a fearful crack . Green then caught the astonished Peggy round the neck , kissed her lips violently , and fled like the wind ; removed all traces of his personal identity , and up to London by the train in the character of a young swell , with a self - fitting eyeglass and a long moustache the colour of his tender mistress 's eyebrow : tow . From town he wrote to her , made her a formal offer of marriage ; and gave her an address to write to “
207177	207225	207162	207162	she	5783	” I suppose he specified sincere because it was no longer sincere : he hurled the offer into Musgrove Cottage by way of an apple of discord — at least so I infer from the memorandum , with which he retired at present from the cash hunt . “
207265	207500	207501	207501	Papa	426	” Victorious so far , Mr. Hardie had still one pressing anxiety : Dr. Sampson 's placard : this had been renewed , and stared him everywhere in the face . Every copy of it he encountered made him shiver . If he had been a man of impulse , he would have torn it down wherever he saw it ; but he knew that would not do . However , learning from Jane , who had it from old Betty , who had it from Sarah , that Mrs. and Miss Dodd would leave for London the day before the sale , and Edward the day after it , he thought he might venture in the busy intermediate time to take some liberties with it . This he did with excellent tact and judgment . Peggy and a billsticker were seen in conference , and , soon after , the huge bills of a travelling circus were pasted right over both the rival advertisements in which the name of Hardie figured . The consequence was , Edward raised no objection : he was full of the sale for one thing ; but I suspect he was content to see his own false move pasted over on such easy terms . One morning Peggy brought in the letters , and Jane saw one in Alfred 's handwriting . She snatched it up , and cried “
207506	207535	207501	207501	Papa	426	” And she left off making the tea , while her father opened it with comparative composure . This coolness , however , did not outlast the perusal : “
207540	207544	207551	207551	he	312	” said he ; “
207563	207564	207551	207551	he	312	” “
207571	207586	207569	207569	papa	1059	” He held her out the letter ; but hesitated and drew it back . “
207649	207650	207644	207644	you	0	” “
207654	207658	207651	207652	Unhappy Alfred	780	” said Jane . “
207681	207682	207679	207679	he	4670	” “
207691	207699	207701	207701	he	4670	” And he showed her the date . “
207777	207778	207775	207775	Jenny	401	” “
207782	207793	207779	207780	Unhappy Alfred	780	” cried Jane , with the tears in her eyes ; “
207798	207799	207804	207804	me	0	” “
207806	207811	207804	207804	me	0	” said Mr. Hardie ; “
207845	207846	207842	207842	I	0	” “
207874	208356	208357	208357	You	5803	” She rose from the table and sealed this with a pious kiss ; and , when she sat down with a pink flush on her delicate cheek , his hard eye melted and dwelt on her with beaming tenderness . His heart yearned over her , and a pang went through it : to think that he must deceive even her , the one sweet soul that loved him ! It was a passing remorse : the successful plotter soon predominated , and it was with unmixed satisfaction he saw her put on her bonnet directly after breakfast and hurry off to Albion Villa to play the part of his unconscious sieve . He himself strolled in the opposite direction , not to seem to be watching her . He was in good spirits : felt like a general , who , after repulsing many desperate attacks successfully , orders an advance , and sees the tide of battle roll away from his bayonets . His very body seemed elastic , indomitable ; he walked lustily out into the country , sniffed the perfumed hedges , and relished life . To be sure he could not walk away from all traces of his misdeeds ; he fell in with objects that to an ordinary sinner might have spoiled the walk , and even marred the spring - time . He found his creditor Maxley with grizzly beard and bloodshot eyes , belabouring a milestone ; and two small boys quizzing him , and pelting him with mud : and soon after he met his creditor , old Dr. Phillips , in a cart , coming back to Barkington to end his days there , at the almshouse . But to our triumphant Bankrupt and Machiavel these things were literally nothing : he paced complacently on , and cared no more for either of those his wrecks than the smiling sea itself seems to care for the dead ships and men it washed ashore a week ago . He came home before luncheon for his gossip with Jane ; but she had not returned . All the better ; her budget would be the larger . To while the time he got his file of the Times , and amused himself noting down the fluctuations in Peruvian bonds . While thus employed he heard a loud knock at his door , and soon after Peggy 's voice and a man 's in swift collision . Hasty feet came along the passage , the parlour door opened , and a young man rushed in pale as ashes , and stared at him ; he was breathless , and his lips moved , but no sound came . It was Edward Dodd . Mr. Hardie rose like a tower and manned himself to repulse this fresh assault . The strange visitor gasped out , “
208364	208581	208357	208357	You	5803	” JANE HARDIE had found Albion Villa in the miserable state that precedes an auction : the house raw , its contents higgledy - piggledy . The stair carpets , and drawing - room carpets , were up , and in rolls in the dining - room ; the bulk of the furniture was there too ; the auction was to be in that room . The hall was clogged with great packages , and littered with small , all awaiting the railway carts ; and Edward , dusty and deliquescent , was cording , strapping , and nailing them at the gallop , in his shirt sleeves . Jane 's heart sank at the visible signs of his departure . She sighed ; and then , partly to divert his attention , told him hastily there was a letter from Alfred . On this he ran upstairs and told Mrs. Dodd ; and she came downstairs , and after a conversation took Jane up softly to her friend 's room . They opened the door gently , and Jane saw the grief she was come to console — or to embitter . Such a change ! instead of the bright , elastic , impetuous young beauty , there sat a pale , languid girl , with “
208586	208740	208357	208357	You	5803	” written on every part of her eloquent body ; her right hand dangled by her side , and on the ground beneath it lay a piece of work she had been attempting ; but it had escaped from those listless fingers : her left arm was stretched at full length on the table with an unspeakable abandon , and her brow laid wearily on it above the elbow . So lies the wounded bird , so droops the broken lily . She did not move for Jane 's light foot . She often sat thus , a drooping statue , and let the people come and go unheeded . Jane 's heart yearned for her . She came softly and laid a little hand lightly on her shoulder , and true to her creed that we must look upward for consolation , said in her ear , and in solemn silvery tones , “
208765	208896	208917	208917	You	5808	” Julia turned at this and flung her arms round Jane 's neck , and panted heavily . Jane kissed her , and with tears in her eyes , proceeded to pour out , from a memory richly stored with Scripture , those blessed words it is full of , words that in our hours of ease or biblical criticism pass over the mind like some drowsy chime but in the bitter day of anguish and bereavement , when the body is racked , the soul darkened , shine out like stars to the mariner ; seem then first to swell to their real size and meaning , and come to writhing mortals like pitying seraphim , divinity on their faces and healing on their wings . Julia sighed heavily : “
208899	208903	208917	208917	You	5808	” she said , “
209017	209018	208997	208997	He	481	” “
209027	209053	208997	208997	He	481	” said Mrs. Dodd quietly . She was one of those who take human nature as it is , and make the best of it . “
209057	209061	209054	209054	Julia	255	” said Jane , “
209076	209084	209085	209085	He	312	” Julia trembled , but said nothing . “
209092	209093	209085	209085	He	312	” “
209099	209100	209085	209085	He	312	” “
209106	209107	209108	209108	I	0	” “
209118	209119	209108	209108	I	0	” “
209134	209135	209128	209128	I	0	” “
209141	209157	209137	209137	you	0	” asked Julia , trembling now like an aspen , and fluttering like a bird . “
209212	209236	209240	209241	Mrs. Dodd	253	” Mrs. Dodd thanked her warmly ; but asked her if she could not in the meantime give some idea of the contents . “
209282	209283	209275	209275	papa	1059	” “
209288	209293	209275	209275	papa	1059	” said Mrs. Dodd , “
209303	209304	209275	209275	papa	1059	” “
209311	209315	209275	209275	papa	1059	” said Jane , “
209365	209443	209361	209361	I	0	” And Jane Hardie began to cry . Mrs. Dodd embraced her like a mother , and entered into her filial feelings : Mrs. Dodd had never seen her so weak , and , therefore , never thought her so amiable . Thus occupied they did not at first observe how these tidings were changing Julia . But presently looking up , they saw her standing at her full height on fire with wrath and insulted pride . “
209452	209456	209457	209457	Mamma	275	” she cried . “
209487	209538	209539	209539	My	0	” They tried to calm her , but in vain ; a new gust of passion possessed the ardent young creature and would have vent . She reddened from bosom to brow , and the scalding tears ran down her flaming cheeks , and she repeated between her clenched teeth , “
209570	209815	209816	209816	Our	5824	” And with this she went haughtily out of the room , not to expose the passion which overpowered her . Mrs. Dodd took advantage of her absence to thank Jane for her kindness , and told her she had also received some letters by this morning 's post , and thought it would be neither kind on her part nor just to conceal their purport from her . She then read her a letter from Mrs. Beresford , and another from Mr. Grey , in answer to queries about the 14,000l .. Sharpe , I may as well observe , was at sea ; Bayliss drowned . Mrs. Beresford knew nothing about the matter . Mr. Grey was positive Captain Dodd , when in command , had several thousand pounds in his cabin ; Mrs. Beresford 's Indian servant had been detected trying to steal it , and put in irons : believed the lady had not been told the cause — out of delicacy ! and Captain Roberts had liberated him . As to whether the money had escaped the wreck — if on Captain Dodd 's person , it might have been saved ; but if not , it was certainly lost : for Captain Dodd to his knowledge had run on deck from the passenger 's cabin the moment the ship struck , and had remained there till she went to pieces ; and everything was washed out of her . “
209820	209825	209826	209826	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd , “
209856	209896	209849	209850	your papa	1955	” Jane thanked her , and said she thought so too : and what a sad thing it was . Soon after this Julia returned , pale and calm as a statue , and sat down humbly beside Jane . “
209903	209907	209849	209850	your papa	1955	” she said : “
209939	210015	210016	210016	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd retired , with her usual tact and self - denial . Then Jane Hardie , being alone with her friend , and full of sorrow , sympathy , and faith , found words of eloquence almost divine to raise her . With these pious consolations Julia 's pride and self - respect now co - operated . Relieved of her great terror , she felt her insult to her fingers ' ends : “
210032	210036	210037	210037	I	0	” she said . “
210073	210095	210113	210113	herself	5834	” Some tears forced their way at these brave , gentle words . Jane gave her time . Then she said : “
210178	210179	210182	210182	I	0	” “
210187	210191	210182	210182	I	0	” said Julia ; “
210196	210273	210274	210274	You	0	” She put on her bonnet , and went down with her friend ; but at the street door the strange feeling of shame overpowered her ; she blushed and trembled , and begged to substitute the garden for the road . Jane consented , and said everything must have a beginning . The fresh air , the bursting buds , and all the face of nature , did Julia good , and she felt it . “
210278	210289	210274	210274	You	0	” said she , with something of her old impetuosity , “
210310	210365	210295	210295	I	0	” They walked hand in hand for a good half hour , and then Jane said she must go ; papa would miss her . Julia was sorry to part with her , and almost without thinking , accompanied her through the house to the front gate ; and that was another point gained . “
210378	210382	210366	210366	I	0	” said she . “
210414	210418	210407	210409	my guardian angel	9035	” Jane smiled . “
210423	210427	210407	210409	my guardian angel	9035	” said she , “
210488	210617	210619	210619	you	5841	” They kissed one another , and Julia stood at the gate and looked lovingly after her , with the tears standing thick in her own violet eyes . Now Maxley was coming down the road , all grizzly and bloodshot , baited by the boys , who had gradually swelled in number as he drew nearer the town . Jane was shocked at their heathenish cruelty , and went off the path to remonstrate with them . On this , Maxley fell upon her , and began beating her about the head and shoulders with his heavy stick . The miserable boys uttered yells of dismay , but did nothing . Julia uttered a violent scream , but flew to her friend 's aid , and crying , “
210625	210985	210622	210622	you	5841	” actually caught the man by the throat and shook him violently . He took his hand off Jane Hardie , who instantly sank moaning on the ground , and he cowered like a cur at the voice and the purple gleaming eyes of the excited girl . The air filled with cries , and Edward ran out of the house to see what was the matter ; but on the spot nobody was game enough to come between the furious man and the fiery girl . The consequence was , her impetuous courage began to flag and her eye to waver ; the demented man found this out by some half animal instinct , and instantly caught her by the shoulder and whirled her down on her knees ; then raised his staff high to destroy her . She screamed , and was just putting up her hands , womanlike , not to see her death as well as feel it , when something dark came past her like a rushing wind — a blow , that sounded exactly like that of a paving ram , caught Maxley on the jaw : and there was Edward Dodd blowing like a grampus with rage , and Maxley on his back in the road . But men under cerebral excitement are not easily stunned , and know no pain : he bounded off the ground , and came at Edward like a Spanish bull . Edward slipped aside , and caught him another ponderous blow that sent him staggering , and his bludgeon flew out of his hand , and Edward caught it . Lo ! the maniac flew at him again more fiercely than ever ; but the young Hercules had seen Jane bleeding on the ground : he dealt her assailant in full career such a murderous stroke with the bludgeon , that the people , who were running from all quarters , shrieked with dismay — not for Jane , but for Maxley ; and well they might ; that awful stroke laid him senseless , motionless and mute , in a pool of his own blood . “
210999	211004	210996	210997	the man	8724	” was the cry . “
211008	211072	211073	211073	You	5845	” said Edward sternly . He then kneeled over his sweetheart and lifted her in his arms like a child . Her bonnet was all broken , her eyes were turned upwards and set , and a little blood trickled down her cheek ; and that cheek seemed streaked white and red . He was terrified , agonised ; yet he gasped out , “
211084	211090	211093	211093	Edward	254	” She knew the voice . “
211095	211257	211093	211093	Edward	254	” she said piteously and tenderly , and then moaned a little on his broad bosom . He carried her into the house out of the crowd . Poor old doctor Phillips , coming in to end his days in the almshouse , had seen it all : he got out of his cart and hobbled up . He had been in the army , and had both experience and skill . He got her bonnet off , and at sight of her head looked very grave . In a minute a bed was laid in the drawing - room , and all the windows and doors open : and Edward , trembling now in every limb , ran to Musgrove Cottage , while Mrs. Dodd and Julia loosened the poor girl 's dress , and bathed her wounds with tepid water ( the doctor would not allow cold ) , and put wine carefully to her lips with a teaspoon . “
211267	211273	211276	211276	sir	1075	” said Mr. Hardie superciliously . “
211278	211282	211276	211276	sir	1075	” said Edward , “
211304	211305	211291	211292	A ruffian	2367	” “
211310	211320	211291	211292	A ruffian	2367	” asked Mr. Hardie , beginning to be uneasy . “
211343	211459	211333	211333	you	8747	” Mr. Hardie rose hurriedly and put on his hat , and accompanied him , half confused . Soon Edward 's mute agitation communicated itself to him , and he went striding and trembling by his side . The crowd had gone with insensible Maxley to the hospital , but the traces of the terrible combat were there . Where Maxley fell the last time , a bullock seemed to have been slaughtered at the least . The miserable father came on this , and gave a great scream like a woman , and staggered back white as a sheet . Edward laid his hand on him , for he seemed scarce able to stand . “
211466	211476	211333	211333	you	8747	” he cried , comprehending the mistake at last ; “
211503	211504	211494	211494	I	0	” “
211517	211518	211509	211509	you	0	” “
211545	211546	211530	211530	He	5855	” “
211571	211572	211564	211569	such a friend in your house	5860	” “
211580	211584	211564	211569	such a friend in your house	5860	” said Edward ; “
211593	211603	211588	211588	you	1075	” then , with a great cry of anguish , “
211608	211722	211604	211604	I	0	” At this blunt declaration , so new and so offensive to him , Mr. Hardie winced , and stopped bewildered . But they were at the gate , and Edward hurried him on . At the house door he drew back once more ; for he felt a shiver of repugnance at entering this hateful house , of whose happiness he was the destroyer . But enter it he must ; it was his fate . The wife of the poor Captain he had driven mad met him in the passage , her motherly eyes full of tears for him , and both hands held out to him like a pitying angel . “
211728	211892	211725	211726	Mr. Hardie	312	” she said in a broken voice , and took him , and led him , wonder - struck , stupefied , shivering with dark fears , to the room where his crushed daughter lay . MR . HARDIE found his daughter lying ashy pale on a little bed in the drawing - room of Albion Villa . She was now scarce conscious . The old doctor sat at her head looking very grave ; and Julia kneeled over her beloved friend , pale as herself ; with hands clasped convulsively , and great eyes of terror and grief . That vivid young face , full of foreboding and woe , struck Mr. Hardie the moment he entered , and froze his very heart . The strong man quivered and sank slowly like a felled tree by the bedside ; and his face and the poor girl 's , whose earthly happiness he had coldly destroyed , nearly met over his crushed daughter . “
211898	211902	211725	211726	Mr. Hardie	312	” he gasped ; “
211908	211909	211906	211906	Jane	276	” “
211915	211920	211912	211912	me	0	” she moaned feebly . “
211929	211934	211935	211936	Poor papa	4407	” said Julia softly . “
211938	211950	211935	211936	Poor papa	4407	” said she , turning rather to Julia than to him . “
211955	211986	211935	211936	Poor papa	4407	” She was in a half lethargic state . Mr. Hardie asked the doctor in an agitated whisper if he might move her home . The doctor shook his head : “
212024	212043	212044	212044	Edward	254	” At these terrible words Mr. Hardie groaned : and they all began to speak below the breath . “
212046	212052	212044	212044	Edward	254	” murmured Mrs. Dodd hurriedly , “
212093	212094	212095	212095	You	254	” “
212104	212139	212095	212095	You	254	” muttered Mr. Hardie humbly , quite cowed by the blow that had fallen on him . The words agitated Mrs. Dodd with many thoughts , but she whispered as calmly as she could , “
212151	212216	212218	212218	she	5872	” Mr. Hardie begged to see the extent of the injury . Mrs. Dodd dissuaded him , but he persisted . Then the doctor showed her poor head . At that the father uttered a scream and sat quivering . Julia buried her face in the bed - clothes directly , and sobbed vehemently . It passed faintly across the benumbed and shuddering father , “
212228	212822	212823	212823	Papa	426	” but the thought made little impression at the time ; the mind was too full of terror and woe . The doctor now asked for brandy in a whisper . Mrs. Dodd left the room with stealthy foot , and brought it . He asked for a quill . Julia went with swift , stealthy foot , and brought it . With adroit and tender hands they aided the doctor , and trickled stimulants down her throat . Then sat like statues of grief about the bed ; only every now and then eye sought eye , and endeavoured to read what the other thought . Was there hope ? Was there none ? And by - and - bye , so roving is the mind , especially when the body is still , these statues began to thrill with thoughts of the past as well as the absorbing present . Ay , here were met a strange party ; a stranger , for its size , methinks , never yet met on earth , to mingle their hearts together in one grief . Just think ! Of him who sat there with his face hidden in his hands , and his frame shuddering , all the others were the victims . Yet the lady , whose husband he had robbed and driven mad , pitied and sympathised with him , and he saw it ; the lady , whom he had insulted at the altar and blighted her young heart and life , pitied and sympathised with him ; the poor old doctor pitied and sympathised , and was more like an anxious father than a physician . Even Jane was one of his victims ; for she fell by the hand of a man he had dishonestly ruined and driven out of his senses . Thinking of all he had done , and this the end of it , he was at once crushed and melted . He saw with awe that a mightier hand than man 's was upon him ; it had tossed him and his daughter into the house and the arms of the injured Dodds , in defiance of all human calculation ; and he felt himself a straw in that hand : so he was , and the great globe itself . Oh , if Jane should die ! the one creature he loved , the one creature , bereaved of whom he could get no joy even from riches . What would he not give to recall the past , since all his schemes had but ended in this . Thus stricken by terror of the divine wrath , and touched by the goodness and kindness of those he had cruelly wronged , all the man was broken with remorse . Then he vowed to undo his own work as far as possible : he would do anything , everything , if Heaven would spare him his child . Now it did so happen that these resolves , earnest and sincere but somewhat vague , were soon put to the test ; and , as often occurs , what he was called on to do first was that which he would rather have done last . Thus it was : about five o'clock in the afternoon Jane Hardie opened her eyes and looked about her . It was a moment of intense anxiety . They all made signals , but held their breath . She smiled at sight of Mr. Hardie , and said , “
212828	212864	212825	212826	dear papa	4508	” There was great joy : silent on the part of Mrs. Dodd and Julia ; but Mr. Hardie , who saw in this a good omen , Heaven recognising his penitence , burst out : “
212905	212937	212938	212938	Papa	426	” Jane did not seem to pay much heed to these words : she looked straight before her like one occupied with her own thought , and said distinctly and solemnly , “
212944	212996	212938	212938	Papa	426	” It fell on all three like a clap of thunder , those gentle but decided tones , those simple natural words . Julia 's eyes flashed into her mother 's , and then sought the ground directly . There was a dead silence . Mr. Hardie was the one to speak “
213012	213013	213003	213007	Those who love you best	5880	” “
213026	213034	213024	213024	sir	1075	” said the doctor , in alarm . “
213064	213246	213247	213247	You	5883	” Mr. Hardie was sore perplexed . He recoiled from the sudden exposure that might take place , if Alfred without any preparation or previous conciliatory measures were allowed to burst in upon them . And while his mind was whirling within him in doubt and perplexity , Jane spoke again ; but no longer calmly and connectedly ; she was beginning to wander . Presently in her wandering she spoke of Edward ; called him dear Edward . Mrs. Dodd rose hastily , and her first impulse was to ask both gentlemen to retire : so instinctively does a good woman protect her own sex against the other . But , reflecting that this was the father , she made an excuse and retired herself instead , followed by Julia . The doctor divined , and went to the window . The father sat by the bed , and soon gathered his daughter loved Edward Dodd . The time was gone by when this would have greatly pained him . He sighed like one overmatched by fate ; but said , “
213284	213342	213344	213344	you	0	” She paid no attention and wandered on a little ; but her mind gradually cleared , and by - and - bye she asked quietly for a glass of water . Mr. Hardie gave it her . She sipped , and he took it from her . She looked at him close , and said distinctly , “
213349	213350	213344	213344	you	0	” “

213370	213409	213410	213410	My	0	” she said gravely . Mr. Hardie trembled . Then , being alone with her , the miserable man unable to say no , unwilling to say yes , tried to persuade her not to ask for Alfred . “
213413	213417	213410	213410	My	0	” he whispered , “
213439	213440	213443	213443	papa	1059	” “
213447	213448	213443	213443	papa	1059	” “

213504	213508	213510	213510	you	426	” said Jane , “

213581	213591	213575	213575	I	0	” said Mr. Hardie , and hung his head . “
213597	213600	213601	213607	those wicked men with their dark words	5897	” she cried “
213639	213640	213614	213614	him	312	” “
213651	213658	213643	213644	my child	1441	” cried Mr. Hardie , trembling . “
213665	213666	213667	213667	I	0	” “
213670	213674	213675	213675	I	0	” she cried , “

213725	213726	213703	213703	you	1441	” “
213778	213786	213788	213790	the agonised father	5906	“ Oh no ! no ! no ! ”
213798	213874	213875	213875	She	5907	“ I will . He shall be here in twelve hours . Only promise me to bear up . Have a strong will ; have courage . You shall have Alfred , you shall have anything you like on earth , anything that money can get you . What am I saying ? I have no money ; it is all gone . But I have a father 's heart . Madam , Mrs. Dodd ! ”
213879	213981	213875	213875	She	5907	“ Can you give me paper ? No , I wo n't trust to a letter . I 'll send off a special messenger this moment . It is for my son , madam . He will be here to - morrow morning . God knows how it will all end . But how can I refuse my dying child ? Oh , madam , you are good , kind , forgiving ; keep my poor girl alive for me : keep telling her Alfred is coming ; she cares more for him than for her poor heart - broken father . ”
214067	214079	214082	214082	herself	255	“ He is coming , love ; all shall be well . ”
214099	214115	214082	214082	herself	255	“ Blessed are the peacemakers ; for they shall be called the children of God . ”
214241	214265	214228	214228	Julia	255	“ She is sleeping ; the doctor has hopes . Oh , sir , let us all pray for her day and night . ”
214315	214319	214321	214321	she	705	“ Good Heavens ! ”
214323	214347	214321	214321	she	705	“ have you forgotten ? He says he will kill you the first day he gets out . You told me so yourself . ”
214348	214388	214389	214389	He	778	“ Yes , Baker said so . I ca n't help it . I do n't care what becomes of me ; I care only for my child . Leave me , Peggy ; there , go , go . ”
214414	214418	214419	214419	he	778	“ O God , ”
214422	214555	214419	214419	he	778	“ I own my sins , and I repent them . Spare but my child , who never sinned against Thee , and I will undo all I have done amiss in Thy sight . I will refund that money on which Thy curse lies . I will throw myself on their mercy . I will set my son free . I will live on a pittance . I will part with Peggy . I will serve Mammon no more . I will attend Thine ordinances . I will live soberly , honestly , and godly all the remainder of my days ; only do Thou spare my child . She is Thy servant , and does Thy work on earth , and there is nothing on earth I love but her . ”
214582	214784	214579	214580	Dr. Wycherley	659	“ DEAR SIR,—My poor daughter lies dangerously wounded , and perhaps at the point of death . She cries for her brother . He must come down to us instantly with the bearer of this . Send one of your people with him if you like . But it is not necessary . I enclose a blank cheque , signed , which please fill at your discretion.—I am , with thanks , yours in deep distress , DR . SHORT arrived , approved Dr. Phillips 's treatment , and said the case was severe but not hopeless , and he would call again . A bed was prepared in the house for Mr. Hardie : but neither he nor any of the Dodds closed an eye that sorrowful night . About midnight , after a short slumber , the sufferer became uneasy , and begged to be left with Julia . Julia was sent for , and found her a good deal excited . She inquired more than once if they were quite alone , and then asked for paper and a pencil . She wrote a few lines , and made Julia put them in a cover and seal them . “
214790	214794	214796	214796	me	0	” she said , “
214846	214859	214861	214863	a dying sister	5928	” Julia pledged her honour . Then Jane wrote on the cover , “
214865	214878	214912	214912	He	5929	” Julia saw that ; and wept sore . Jane comforted her . “
214977	215023	215024	215024	I	0	” In this spirit of full resignation she abode constant , and consoled her weeping friends from time to time , whenever she was quite herself . About daybreak , being alone with her father , she shed a few tears at his lonely condition . “
215031	215035	215026	215026	you	5929	” said she . “
215099	215111	215112	215112	You	1054	” The miserable father tried to be playful and scold her : “
215121	215125	215112	215112	You	1054	” he said . “
215273	215283	215261	215261	me	0	” Even this could not disturb the dying Christian . “
215287	215291	215261	215261	me	0	” she said ; “
215362	215514	215515	215515	Alfred	312	” At ten in the morning Mr. Hardie 's messenger returned without Alfred , and with a note from Dr. Wycherley to this effect , that , the order for Alfred 's admission into his asylum being signed by Mr. Thomas Hardie , he could not send him out even for a day except on Thomas Hardie 's authority ; it would be a violation of the law . Under the circumstances , however , he thought he might venture to receive that order by telegraph . If , then , Mr. Hardie would telegraph Thomas Hardie in Yorkshire to telegraph him ( Wycherley ) , Alfred should be sent with two keepers wherever Mr. T. Hardie should so direct . Now Mr. Hardie had already repented of sending for Alfred at all . So , instead of telegraphing Yorkshire , he remained passive , and said sullenly to Mrs. Dodd , “
215523	215576	215515	215515	Alfred	312	” Thus Routine kept the brother from his dying sister . They told Jane , with aching hearts , there was reason to fear Alfred could not arrive that day . She only gave a meaning look at Julia , about the paper ; and then she said with a little sigh , “
215583	215654	215515	215515	Alfred	312	” This was the last disappointment Heaven allowed Earth to inflict on her ; and the shield of Faith turned its edge . One hour of pain , another of delirium , and now the clouds that darken this mortal life seemed to part and pass , and Heaven to open full upon her . She spoke of her coming change no longer with resignation ; it was with rapture . “
215657	215661	215515	215515	Alfred	312	” she cried , “
215692	215828	215829	215829	I	0	” The strong and healthy wept and groaned aloud ; but she they sorrowed for was all celestial bliss . In her lifetime she had her ups and downs of religious fervour ; was not without feverish heats , and cold misgivings and depression ; but all these fled at that dread hour when the wicked are a prey to dark misgivings , or escape into apathy . This timid girl that would have screamed at a scratch , met the King of Terrors with smiles and triumph . For her the grave was Jordan , and death was but the iron gate of life everlasting . Mors janua vitae . Yet once or twice she took herself to task : but only to show she knew what the All - Pure had forgiven her . “
215836	215840	215829	215829	I	0	” she said ; “
215966	216115	216116	216116	She	12431	” This prayer was granted ; the body failed more and more ; she could not swallow even a drop of wine ; she could not even praise her Redeemer ; that is to say , she could not speak . Yet she lay and triumphed . With hands put together in prayer , and eyes full of praise and joy unspeakable , she climbed fast to God . While she so mounted in the spirit , her breath came at intervals unusually long , and all were sent for to see Death conquer the body and be conquered by the soul . At last , after an unnaturally long interval , she drew a breath like a sigh . They waited for another ; waited , waited in vain . She had calmly ceased to live . The old doctor laid down her hand reverently , and said “
216123	216129	216116	216116	She	12431	” Then with many tears , “
216150	216256	216143	216143	I	0	” Richard Hardie was led from the room in a stupor . Immediately after death all the disfiguring effect of pain retired , and the happy soul seemed to have stamped its own celestial rapture on the countenance at the moment of leaving it ; a rapture so wonderful , so divine , so more than mortal calm , irradiated the dead face . The good Christians she left behind her looked on and feared to weep , lest they should offend Him , who had taken her to Himself , and set a visible seal upon the house of clay that had held her . “
216261	216267	216259	216259	mamma	1053	” cried Julia with fervour , “
216290	216853	216854	216854	Alfred	312	” And it was some hours before she cooled , and began to hang on Edward 's neck and weep his loss and hers , as weep we mortals must , though the angels of Heaven are rejoicing . Thus died in the flower of her youth , and by what we call a violent death , the one child Richard Hardie loved ; member of a religious party whose diction now and then offends one to the soul : but the root of the matter is in them ; allowance made for those passions , foibles , and infirmities of the flesh , even you and I are not entirely free from , they live fearing God , and die loving Him . There was an inquest next day , followed in due course by a public trial of James Maxley . But these are matters which , though rather curious and interesting , must be omitted , or touched hereafter and briefly . The effect of Jane 's death on Richard Hardie was deplorable . He saw the hand of Heaven ; but did not bow to it : so it filled him with rage , rebellion , and despair . He got his daughter away and hid himself in the room with her ; scarce stirring out by night or day . He spoke to no one ; he shunned the Dodds : he hated them . He said it was through visiting their house she had met her death , and at their door . He would not let himself see it was he who had sent her there with his lie . He loathed Alfred , calling him the cause of all . He asked nobody to the funeral : and , when Edward begged permission to come , he gave a snarl like a wild beast and went raging from him . But Edward would go : and at the graveside pitying Heaven relieved the young fellow 's choking heart with tears . But no such dew came to that parched old man , who stood on its other side like the withered Archangel , his eyes gloomy and wild , his white cheek ploughed deep with care and crime and anguish , his lofty figure bowed by his long warfare , his soul burning and sickening by turns , with hatred and rebellion , with desolation and despair . He went home and made his will ; for he felt life hang on him like lead , and that any moment he might kill himself to be rid of it . Strange to say , he left a sum of money to Edward Dodd . A moment before , he did n't know he was going to do it : a moment after , he was half surprised he had done it , and minded to undo it ; but would not take the trouble . He went up to London , and dashed into speculation as some in their despair take to drink . For this man had but two passions ; avarice , and his love for his daughter . Bereaved of her , he must either die , or live for gain . He sought the very cave of Mammon ; he plunged into the Stock Exchange . When Mr. Hardie said , “
216862	216895	216854	216854	Alfred	312	” Mrs. Dodd misunderstood him , naturally enough . She thought the heartless young man had sent some excuse : had chosen to let his sister die neglected rather than face Julia : “
216911	216948	216949	216950	the Wretch	1334	” said Mrs. Dodd , with sovereign contempt . From this moment she conceived a horror of the young man . Edward shared it fully , and the pair always spoke of him under the title of “
216952	217009	216949	216950	the Wretch	1334	” this was when Julia was not by . In her presence he was never mentioned . By this means she would in time forget him , or else see him as they saw him . And as , after all , they knew little to Mr. Hardie 's disadvantage , except what had come out of “
217013	217206	217010	217011	the Wretch	791	” mouth , and as moreover their hearts were softened towards the father by his bereavement , and their sight of his misery , and also by his grateful words , they quite acquitted him of having robbed them , and felt sure the fourteen thousand pounds was at the bottom of the sea . They were a little surprised that Mr. Hardie never spoke nor wrote to them again ; but being high - minded and sweet tempered , they set it down to all - absorbing grief , and would not feel sore about it . And now they must leave the little villa where they had been so happy and so unhappy . The scanty furniture went first ; Mrs. Dodd followed , and arranged it in their apartments . Julia would stay behind to comfort Edward , inconsolable herself . The auction came off . Most of the things went for cruelly little money compared to their value : and with the balance the sad young pair came up to London , and were clasped in their mother 's arms . The tears were in her tender eyes . “
217217	217226	217010	217011	the Wretch	791	” she said : Edward looked round astonished : “
217233	217237	217010	217011	the Wretch	791	” said he , “
217252	217253	217239	217239	you	0	” “
217263	217360	217254	217255	My children	9623	” replied Mrs. Dodd , kissing them both again . Next day they consulted together how they were to live . Edward wished to try and get his father into a public asylum ; then his mother would have a balance to live upon out of her income . But Mrs. Dodd rejected this proposal with astonishment . In vain Edward cited the ' Tiser that public asylums are patterns of comfort , and cure twice as many patients as the private ones do . She was deaf alike to the ' Tiser and to statistics . “
217371	217375	217254	217255	My children	9623	” said she . “
217397	217432	217379	217380	your father	1960	” She then informed them she had written to her Aunt Bazalgette and her Uncle Fountain , and invited them to contribute something towards David 's maintenance . Edward was almost angry at this . “
217439	217443	217379	217380	your father	1960	” said he . “
217456	217461	217446	217446	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd ; “
217469	217610	217611	217613	the Norman Conquest	5960	” While waiting for their answers , a word about the parties and their niece . Our Mrs. Dodd , born Lucy Fountain , was left at nineteen to the care of two guardians : 1 , her Uncle Fountain , an old bachelor , who loved comfort , pedigree , and his own way ; 2 , her Aunt Bazalgette , who loved flirting , dressing , and her own way ; both charming people , when they got their own way ; verjuice , when they did n't : and , to conclude , egotists deep as ocean . From guardians they grew match - makers and rivals by proxy : uncle schemed to graft Lucy on to a stick called Talboys , that came in with the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes , known in pedigrees as “
217615	218181	217611	217613	the Norman Conquest	5960	” Aunt , wife of a merchant of no Descent , except from a high stool , devoted her to Richard Hardie . An unlooked - for obstacle encountered both : Lucy was not amorous . She loved these two egotists and their quadrupeds ; but there she stopped dead short . They persisted ; and , while they pulled her to and fro and ruffled her native calm , David Dodd , first mate of the Something or other East Indiaman — brown cheek , honest speech , heart of gold — fell deep in love and worshipped her at a distance . His timidity and social insignificance made him harmless ; so egotist Fountain had him in to dessert to spin yarns ; egotist Bazalgette invited him to her house to flirt with . At this latter place he found Hardie and Talboys both courting Lucy ; this drove him mad , and in his fury he popped . Lucy declined him secundum artem : he went away blessing her , with a manly sob or two . Lucy cried a little and took a feminine spite against his rivals , who remained to pester her . Now Talboys , spurred by uncle , had often all but popped ; only some let , hindrance , or just impediment had still interposed : once her pony kept prancing at each effort he made towards Hymen ; they do say the subtle virgin kept probing the brute with a hair pin , and made him caracole and spill the treacle as fast as it came her way . However , now Talboys elected to pop by sea . It was the element his ancestors had invaded fair England by ; and on its tranquil bosom a lover is safe from prancing steeds , and the myriad anti - pops of terra firma . Miss Lucy consented to the water excursion demurely , designing to bring her sickly wooer to the point and so get rid of him for ever and ever . Plot and counter - plot were baffled by the elements : there came an anti - pop out of the south - west called a gale . Talboys boated so skilfully that he and his intended would have been united without ceremony by Father Nep , at the bottom of the British Channel , but for David Dodd , who was hovering near in jealous anguish and a cutter . He saved them both , but in the doing of it missed his ship , and professional ruin faced him . Then good - hearted Lucy was miserable , and appealed to Mr. Bazalgette , and he managed somehow to get David made captain of the Rajah . The poor girl thought she had squared the account with David ; but he refused the ship unless she would go halves , and while her egotists bullied and vexed her , he wrought so upon her pity , and teased her so , that to get rid of his importunity she married him . In time she learned to love him ten times better than if she had begun all flames . Uncle and aunt cut her tolerably dead for some years . Uncle came round the first ; some antiquarian showed him that Dodd was a much more ancient family than Talboys . “
218205	218428	217611	217613	the Norman Conquest	5960	” Mrs. Bazalgette , too , had long corresponded with her periodically , and on friendly terms . The answers came on the same day , curiously enough . Uncle Fountain , ruined by railway speculation , was living on an allowance from creditors ; but his house was at their service , if they liked to live with him — and board themselves . Mrs. Bazalgette 's was the letter of a smooth woman , who has hoarded imperishable spite . She reminded her niece after all these years , that her marriage with David was an act of disobedience and ingratitude . She then enumerated her own heavy expenses , all but the 400l . a year she spent in bedizening her carcass , and finally , amidst a multitude of petty insults , she offered to relieve Mrs. Dodd of — Julia . Now Poetry has reconciled us to an asp in a basket of figs ; but here was a scorpion in a bundle of nettles . Poor Mrs. Dodd could not speak after reading it . She handed it to Edward , and laid her white forehead wearily in her hand . Edward put the letter in an envelope and sent it back with a line in his own hand declining all further correspondence with the writer . “
218434	218438	217611	217613	the Norman Conquest	5960	” said he , “
218496	218497	218492	218492	you	8585	” “
218504	218509	218492	218492	you	8585	” said Julia eagerly . “
218539	218540	218528	218528	I	0	” “
218545	218550	218528	218528	I	0	” said Edward sadly ; “
218613	218674	218675	218675	You	8585	” He could say no more for the emotion his own words caused him ; thinking of Jane , he broke down altogether , and ran out of the room . However , he came back in an hour with his eyes red , but his heart indomitable ; determined to play a man 's part for all their sakes . “
218678	218710	218675	218675	You	8585	” said he , with something of his old genial way , that sounded so strange to one looking at his red eyes , and inspired a desire to hug him , “
218908	218970	218972	218972	he	5979	” He stood like a colossus , and held out his hand to them ; they clung round his neck in a moment , as if to illustrate his words ; clung tight , and blessed him for standing so firm and forbidding them to part . Mrs. Dodd sighed , after the first burst of enthusiastic affection , and said : “
218988	218989	218972	218972	he	5979	” “
218996	219000	218972	218972	he	5979	” said Julia . “
219010	219011	218972	218972	he	5979	” “
219016	219017	218972	218972	he	5979	” “
219035	219036	219026	219027	my daubs	5984	” “
219046	219047	219051	219051	you	0	” “
219054	219059	219061	219061	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd , “
219066	219067	219061	219061	I	0	” “
219111	219112	219113	219114	My mamma	1392	” “
219118	219122	219113	219114	My mamma	1392	” cried Julia ; “
219139	219140	219136	219137	poor mamma	1632	” “
219179	219180	219177	219177	me	0	” “
219185	219189	219183	219183	myself	0	” said Edward , “
219227	219339	219219	219219	I	0	” It is easy to settle on a business , hard to get a footing in one . Edward convinced that the dressmaking was their best card , searched that mine of various knowledge , the ' Tiser , for an opening : but none came . At last one of those great miscellaneous houses in the City advertised for a lady to cut cloaks . He proposed to his mother to go with him . She shrank from encountering strangers . No , she would go to a fashionable dressmaker she had employed some years , and ask her advice . Perhaps Madame Blanch would find her something to do . “
219349	219428	219345	219347	the ' Tiser	12211	” said Edward , clinging to his idol . Mrs. Dodd found Madame Blanch occupied in trying to suit one of those heart - breaking idiots , to whom dress is the one great thing , and all things else , sin included , the little ones . She had tried on a scarf three times ; and it discontented her when on , and spoilt all else when off . Mrs. Dodd saw , and said obligingly , “
219442	219536	219537	219537	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd , you must know , had an admirable art of putting on a shawl or scarf . With apparent nonchalance she settled the scarf on her shapely shoulders so happily that the fish bit , and the scarf went into its carriage ; forty guineas , or so . Madame cast a rapid but ardent glance of gratitude Dodd - wards . The customer began to go , and after fidgeting to the door and back for twenty minutes actually went somehow . Then madame turned round , and said , “
219591	219705	219584	219584	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd blushed , and with subdued agitation told Madame Blanch that this time she was come not to purchase but to ask a favour . Misfortune was heavy on her ; and , though not penniless , she was so reduced by her husband 's illness and the loss of 14,000l . by shipwreck , that she must employ what little talents she had to support her family . The woman explored her from head to foot to find the change of fortune in some corner of her raiment : but her customer was as well , though plainly dressed as ever , and still looked an easy - going duchess . “
219722	219728	219719	219719	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd humbly , “
219759	219760	219747	219747	I	0	” “
219769	219775	219766	219766	you	6000	” said Madame Blanch drily . “
219810	219811	219815	219815	madam	8503	” “
219855	219879	219893	219893	mistress	2619	” The dressmaker coloured and hesitated ; she felt the fascination of Dignity donning Humility , and speaking Music : but she resisted . “
219958	219959	219962	219962	madam	8503	” “
219964	219969	219970	219970	you	8503	” sighed Mrs. Dodd , “
219990	219991	219977	219977	you	8503	” “
219996	220002	219977	219977	you	8503	” said the woman hastily , “
220020	220021	220027	220027	madam	8503	” “
220029	220048	220027	220027	madam	8503	” N.B. The dressmaker had dropped the Madam , so the lady used it now at every word . “
220054	220059	220027	220027	madam	8503	” said Madame Blanch . “
220090	220125	220128	220128	I	0	” She then wrote on one of her own cards , Messrs. Cross , Fitchett , Copland , and Tylee , 11 , 12 , 13 , and 14 , Primrose Lane , City . “
220181	220243	220154	220154	she	6018	” Mrs. Dodd put the card in her bosom and pressed the hand extended to her by Madame Zaire Blanch ; whose name was Sally White , spinster . She went back to her children and showed them the card , and sank gracefully into a chair , exhausted as much by the agitation of asking favours as by the walk . “
220259	220263	220154	220154	she	6018	” said Edward : “
220279	220280	220281	220281	I	0	” “
220288	220313	220281	220281	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd , rising quietly from the chair . They begged her to rest herself first . No , she would not . “
220323	220327	220314	220314	I	0	” said she . “
220342	220385	220332	220332	I	0	” And she glided off in her quiet way , to encounter Cross , Fitchett , Copland and Tylee , in the lane where a primrose was caught growing — six hundred years ago . She declined Edward 's company rather peremptorily . “
220392	220507	220332	220332	I	0	” said she . But that was a blind ; the truth was , she could not bear her children to mingle in what she was doing . No , her ambition was to ply the scissors and thimble vigorously , and so enable them to be ladies and gentlemen at large . She being gone , Julia made a parcel of water - colour drawings , and sallied forth all on fire to sell them . But , while she was dressing , Edward started on a cruise in search of employment . He failed entirely . They met in the evening , Mrs. Dodd resigned , Edward dogged , Julia rather excited . “
220516	220520	220511	220511	us	6022	” she said . “
220588	220593	220583	220583	he	6025	” ( imitating him ) “
220645	220650	220652	220653	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ My poor girl , ”
220662	220671	220658	220658	her	253	“ why expose yourself to these cruel rebuffs ? ”
220672	220711	220713	220713	she	253	“ Oh , do n't waste your pity , mamma ; those great babyish tears were a happy thought of mine . He bought two directly to pacify me ; and there 's the money . Thirty shillings ! ”
220721	220726	220728	220728	Edward	254	“ The old cheat , ”
220730	220741	220728	220728	Edward	254	“ they were worth two guineas apiece , I know . ”
220742	220757	220789	220789	she	253	“ Not they ; or why would not anybody else give twopence for them ? ”
220758	220765	220766	220766	He	6025	“ Because pictures are a drug . ”
220816	220920	220789	220789	she	253	“ Children , my heart fell at that question . I was obliged to own myself an amateur and beg a trial . However , I gave Madame Blanch 's card : but Mr.—I do n't know which partner it was — said he was not acquainted with her : then he looked a little embarrassed , I thought , and said the Firm did not care to send its stuff to ladies not in the business . I might cut it to waste , or — he said no more ; but I do really think he meant I might purloin it . ”
220921	220947	220766	220766	He	6025	“ Why was n't I there to look him into the earth ? Oh , mamma , that you should be subjected to all this ! ”
220948	221078	220789	220789	she	253	“ Be quiet , child ; I had only to put on my armour ; and do you know what my armour is ? Thinking of my children . So I put on my armour , and said quietly , we were not so poor but we could pay for a piece of cloth should I be so unfortunate as to spoil it ; and I offered in plain terms to deposit the price as security . But he turned as stiff at that as his yard measure ; ' that was not Cross and Co. 's way of doing business , ' he said . But it is unreasonable to be dejected at a repulse or two ; and I am not out of spirits ; not much : ”
221126	221131	221133	221133	he	6028	“ Order , ladies , ”
221136	221161	221133	221133	he	6028	“ from Cross , Fitchett , and Co. , Primrose Lane . Porter outside with the piece . You can come in , sir . ”
221168	221175	221162	221162	Porter	808	“ Please sign this , ma'am . ”
221211	221229	221207	221208	The other	2684	“ Our Mr. Fitchett wishes you to observe this fall in the pattern . It is new . ”
221230	221252	221207	221208	The other	2684	“ I will , sir . Am I to trouble you with any money — by way of deposit , sir ? ”
221253	221272	221274	221274	he	808	“ No orders about it , ma'am . Ladies , your most obedient . Good morning , sir . ”
221925	221935	221937	221940	a fine young fellow	6055	“ You should be one of us , sir , ”
221951	221959	221961	221961	Edward	254	“ I wish to Heaven I was , ”
221975	221996	221963	221964	The other	2684	“ Then you should talk to our head man after the business ; there is a vacancy , you know . ”
222021	222031	222033	222035	the head man	6058	“ You are a stranger to me , sir , ”
222037	222054	222033	222035	the head man	6058	“ And I am sure it is no place for you ; you are a gentleman . ”
222055	222070	222078	222080	a comic fireman	6060	“ Well ; is there anything ungentlemanly in saving people 's lives and property ? ”
222071	222076	222078	222080	a comic fireman	6060	“ Hear ! hear ! ”
222096	222119	222090	222090	Others	8305	“ Why , Mr. Baldwin , if a gentleman ai n't ashamed of us , why should we be ashamed of him ? ”
222120	222128	222130	222130	another	1228	“ Where will ye get a better ? ”
222135	222147	222130	222130	another	1228	“ He is no stranger ; we 've seen him work . ”
222148	222153	222155	222157	the comic fireman	6063	“ Stop a bit , ”
222159	222181	222155	222157	the comic fireman	6063	“ what does the dog say ? Just call him , sir , if you please ; his name is Charlie . ”
222217	222242	222207	222207	his	254	“ I was rather taken by surprise at first , but , on the whole , I see no reason to recall my judgment . ”
222243	222249	222251	222252	the firemen	6054	“ It is all right , ”
222270	222284	222267	222267	him	254	“ Ye see that there dog — he knows more than we do . ”
222438	222444	222433	222433	he	254	“ I did all that . ”
222470	222476	222478	222478	Julia	255	“ What is that for ? ”
222481	222527	222478	222478	Julia	255	“ Is that sheepish face the thing to wear when a sister is reading out an heroic action ? Ah , these are the things that make one long to be a man , to do them . What are you thinking about , dear ? ”
222528	222543	222641	222642	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ Well , I am thinking the ' Tiser is pitching it rather strong . ”
222544	222552	222478	222478	Julia	255	“ My love , what an expression ! ”
222553	222630	222478	222478	Julia	255	“ Well , then , to be honest , I agree with you that it is a jolly thing to fight with fire and save men 's lives ; and I am glad you see it in that light ; for now you will approve the step I have taken . Ladies , I have put myself in the way of doing this sort of thing every week of my life . I 'm a fireman . ”
222631	222639	222641	222642	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ You are jesting , I trust ? ”
222645	222676	222641	222642	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ No , mamma . I got the place late last night , and I 'm to enter on my duties and put on the livery next Monday . Hurrah ! ”
222719	222724	222713	222713	they	6072	“ Cruel ! cruel ! ”
222729	222736	222713	222713	they	6072	“ Our humiliation is now complete , ”
222943	222983	222939	222939	he	254	“ I know I ca n't contribute as much to our living as you two can — the petticoats carry the brains in our family — but , be a burden to you ? Not if I know it . ”
222984	222991	222993	222993	Julia	255	“ Pride ! pride ! pride ! ”
223005	223020	223022	223023	prosaic mamma	6082	“ And such pride ! The pride that falls into a fire - bucket , ”
223025	223030	223032	223032	Edward	254	“ That is cutting , ”
223034	223060	223032	223032	Edward	254	“ but , soyons de notre siecle ; flunkeyism is on the decline . I 'll give you something to put in both your pipes : “
223065	223070	223022	223023	prosaic mamma	6082	” said Mrs. Dodd , “
223084	223085	223086	223086	Mine	6083	” “
223101	223128	223092	223092	he	6083	” said he , and appealed calmly to their reason , by which means he made no impression at all . Then he happened to say , “
223162	223182	223159	223159	she	815	” Now on this , their faces filled with sympathy directly . So encouraged he went on to say : “
223296	223297	223293	223293	she	815	” “
223302	223308	223293	223293	she	815	” said Mrs. Dodd tearfully , “
223366	223380	223382	223382	Edward	254	“ Why , mother , did n't I tell you it was me ? ”
223386	223394	223396	223396	Julia	255	“ No , that you did not , ”
223398	223418	223396	223396	Julia	255	“ Was it ? was it ? oh do be quick and tell one . There , it was . ”
223419	223452	223497	223497	She	255	“ Well , it was : ah , I remember now ; that splendiferous account shut me up . Oh , I say , did n't the ' Tiser pitch it strong ? ”
223453	223458	223460	223460	Julia	255	“ Not at all , ”
223462	223496	223497	223497	She	255	“ I believe every word , and ever so much more . Mamma , we have got a hero , and here he is at breakfast with us , like an ordinary mortal . ”
223525	223538	223520	223520	she	255	“ And so is mamma . She may say what she likes . ”
223539	223593	223497	223497	She	255	“ Proud of him ! ah , that I am ; very proud , and very unhappy . Heroes are my horror . How often , and how earnestly have I prayed that my son might not be brave like his father , but stay quietly at home out of harm 's way . ”
223848	223852	223841	223841	she	253	“ the Wretch . ”
223865	223869	223859	223859	she	253	“ the Wretch . ”
223933	223963	223928	223928	she	253	“ My darling , do not be afraid of me ; rob me of your happy thoughts if you will , but oh , not of your sad ones . ”
223970	223976	223977	223977	she	255	“ Oh no , mamma , ”
223980	224030	223977	223977	she	255	“ do not you encourage me in my folly . I know I have thrown away my affections on one who —— I shall never see him again : shall I , mamma ? Oh , to think I can say those words , and yet go living on . ”
224035	224053	224031	224032	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ And if you saw him , would that mend the chain he has chosen to break ? ”
224054	224136	224138	224138	she	6105	“ I do n't know ; but if I could only see him to part friends ! It is cruel to hate him now he has lost his sister ; and then I have got her message to give him . And I want to ask him why he was afraid of me : why he could not tell me he had altered his mind : did he think I wanted to have him against his will ? Oh , mamma , ”
224141	224160	224138	224138	she	6105	“ he seemed to love me ; he seemed all truth . I am a poor unfortunate girl . ”
224193	224252	224181	224181	Julia	255	“ My dear friend was , and advised me to be one too ; but I was wilful in those days and chose to visit by fits and starts , and be independent . I am humbled now a little : may I , mamma ? Since she died every word of hers seems a law to me . ”
224738	224755	224733	224733	she	255	“ At any rate , he will help me cure her of ' the Wretch . ' ”
225081	225094	225059	225059	they	6147	“ But for us the ' dear deranged ' would waste it . ”
225335	225379	225331	225331	They	6156	“ Sir,—By order of the Commissioners of Lunacy , I am directed to inform you that they are in the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo , which will be laid before the Board at their next meeting.—I am , & c. ”
225672	225676	225661	225661	he	312	“ The Scornful Dog ”
225868	225911	225858	225858	Alfred	312	“ Mind , doctor , all these pleasant fruitful hours we spend together so sweetly will not prevent my indicting you for a conspiracy as soon as I get out : it will rob the retribution of half its relish , though . ”
225912	225924	225926	225927	the doctor	8653	“ Ah , my dear young friend and fellow - student , ”
225930	226189	225926	225927	the doctor	8653	“ let us not sacrifice the delights of our profitable occupation of imbibing the sweets of intellectual intercourse to vague speculations as to our future destiny . During the course of a long and not , I trust , altogether unprofitable career , it has not unfrequently been my lot to find myself on the verge of being indicted , sued , assassinated , hung . Yet here I sit , as yet unimmolated on the altar of phrenetic vengeance . This is ascribable to the fact that my friends and pupils always adopt a more favourable opinion of me long before I part with them ; and ere many days ( and this I divine by infallible indicia ) , your cure will commence in earnest ; and in proportion as you progress to perfect restoration of the powers of judgment , you will grow in suspicion of the fact of being under a delusion ; or rather I should say a very slight perversion and perturbation of the forces of your admirable intellect , and a proper subject for temporary seclusion . Indeed this consciousness of insanity is the one diagnostic of sanity that never deceives me and , on the other hand , an obstinate persistence in the hypothesis of perfect rationality demonstrates the fact that insanity yet lingers in the convolutions and recesses of the brain , and that it would not be humane as yet to cast the patient on a world in which he would inevitably be taken some ungenerous advantage of . ”
226201	226204	226206	226208	the ready doctor	6175	“ Certainly , ”
226210	226229	226206	226208	the ready doctor	6175	“ and paradoxicality is an indicial characteristic of truth in all matters beyond the comprehension of the vulgar . ”
226230	226235	226237	226238	the maniac	11700	“ That sounds rational , ”
226446	226457	226433	226434	Dr. Eskell	826	“ Allow me to put a few questions to you . ”
226458	226466	226468	226468	Alfred	312	“ The more the better , sir , ”
226553	226563	226547	226547	he	826	“ You have been a scholar , I hear . ”
226564	226577	226579	226579	Alfred	312	“ I am not old enough to be a scholar , sir , ”
226581	226588	226579	226579	Alfred	312	“ but I am a student . ”
226589	226604	226547	226547	he	826	“ Well , well ; now can you tell me what follows this line — “
226612	226613	226547	226547	he	826	” “
226620	226626	226617	226617	you	312	” said Dr. Eskell ironically . “
226641	226642	226547	226547	he	826	” “
226649	226656	226645	226645	I	0	” said Alfred , sneering secretly . “
226661	226673	226674	226674	Alfred	312	“ Quite right ; now go on , if you can . ”
226703	226712	226714	226715	the examiner	6188	“ He seems to have a good memory , ”
226721	226730	226732	226732	Wycherley	659	“ Oh , that is nothing for him , ”
226751	226758	226742	226743	Dr. Eskell	826	“ Spirited lines those , sir . ”
226759	226786	226714	226715	the examiner	6188	“ Yes , sir ; but surely rather tumid . ' The whole forces of the shaken globe ? ' But little poets love big words . ”
226787	226812	226714	226715	the examiner	6188	“ I see ; you agree with Horace , that so great a work as an epic poem should open modestly with an invocation . ”
226813	226818	226820	226820	Alfred	312	“ No , sir , ”
226822	226953	226820	226820	Alfred	312	“ I think that rather an arbitrary and peevish canon of friend Horace . The AEneid , you know , begins just as he says an epic ought not to begin ; and the AEneid is the greatest Latin Epic . In the next place the use of Modesty is to keep a man from writing an epic poem at all but , if he will have that impudence , why then he had better have the courage to plunge into the Castalian stream , like Virgil and Lucan , not crawl in funking and holding on by the Muse 's apron - string . But — excuse me — quorsum haec tam putida tendunt ? What have the Latin poets to do with this modern 's sanity or insanity ? ”
226972	226994	226965	226966	Dr. Eskell	826	“ Continue to answer me as intelligently , and you may find it has a great deal to do with it . ”
227004	227029	227030	227030	He	312	“ Mine was a thoughtless remark : of course a gentleman of your experience can test the mind on any subject , however trivial . ”
227034	227069	227030	227030	He	312	“ Still , if you would but leave the poets , who are all half crazy themselves , and examine me in the philosophers of Antiquity . Surely it would be a higher criterion . ”
227078	227104	227070	227071	Dr. Wycherley	659	“ He labours under an abnormal contempt for poetry , dating from his attack . Previously to that he actually obtained a prize poem himself . ”
227105	227120	227070	227071	Dr. Wycherley	659	“ Well , doctor , and after that am I wrong to despise poetry ? ”
227150	227173	227174	227175	The maniac	11700	“ You might examine my young friend for hours and not detect the one crevice in the brilliancy of his intellectual armour . ”
227186	227305	227174	227175	The maniac	11700	“ For pity 's sake , doctor , do n't be so inaccurate . Say a spot on the brilliancy , or a crevice in the armour ; but not a crevice in the brilliancy . My good friend here , gentlemen , deals in conjectural certificates and broken metaphors . He dislocates more tropes , to my sorrow , than even his friend Shakespeare , whom he thinks a greater philosopher than Aristotle , and who calls the murder of an individual sleeper the murder of sleep , confounding the concrete with the abstract , and then talks of taking arms against a sea of troubles ; query , a cork jacket and a flask of brandy ? ”
227306	227312	227314	227315	Dr. Eskell	826	“ Well , Mr. Hardie , ”
227320	227341	227314	227315	Dr. Eskell	826	“ let me tell you those passages , which so shock your peculiar notions , are among the most applauded . ”
227342	227348	227350	227356	the maniac , whose logic was up	6192	“ Very likely , sir , ”
227358	227401	227350	227356	the maniac , whose logic was up	6192	“ but applauded only in a nation where the floods clap their hands every Sunday morning , and we all pray for peace , giving as our exquisite reason that we have got the God of hosts on our side in war . ”
227428	227442	227421	227421	He	829	“ I wish to put to you a question or two in private . ”
227461	227467	227468	227468	he	312	“ Oh no , gentlemen , ”
227472	227521	227468	227468	he	312	“ Let me have fair play . You have given me no secret audience ; then why give my accuser one ? I am charged with a single delusion ; for mercy 's sake , go to the point at once , and examine me on that head . ”
227522	227528	227530	227531	Mr. Abbott	829	“ Now you talk sense , ”
227544	227551	227530	227531	Mr. Abbott	829	“ But that will excite him , ”
227556	227563	227468	227468	he	312	“ it always does excite them . ”
227564	227575	227577	227577	Alfred	312	“ It excites the insane , but not the sane , ”
227579	227594	227577	227577	Alfred	312	“ So there is another test ; you will observe whether it excites me . ”
227607	227659	227603	227603	he	312	“ The supposed hallucination is this : I strongly suspect my father , a bankrupt — and therefore dishonest — banker , of having somehow misappropriated a sum of fourteen thousand pounds , which sum is known to have been brought from India by one Captain Dodd , and has disappeared . ”
227660	227665	227667	227668	Mr. Abbott	829	“ Stop a minute , ”
227670	227677	227667	227668	Mr. Abbott	829	“ Who knows it besides you ? ”
227678	227702	227603	227603	he	312	“ The whole family of the Dodds . They will show you his letter from India , announcing his return with the money . ”
227703	227709	227667	227668	Mr. Abbott	829	“ Where do they live ? ”
227710	227716	227667	227668	Mr. Abbott	829	“ Albion Villa , Barkington . ”
227783	227808	227778	227778	Wycherley	659	“ Are you quite sure this was not a vision , a phantom of the mind heated by your agitation , and your suspicions ? ”
227820	227835	227837	227837	Alfred	312	“ Pray , doctor , was I the only person who saw this vision ? ”
227840	227845	227847	227847	Wycherley	659	“ I conclude so , ”
227854	227895	227847	227847	Wycherley	659	“ But why do you conclude so ? Because you are one of those who reason in a circle of assumptions . Now it happens that Captain Dodd was seen and felt on that occasion by three persons besides myself . ”
227896	227900	227902	227903	Mr. Abbott	829	“ Name them , ”
227906	227960	227902	227903	Mr. Abbott	829	“ A policeman called Reynolds , another policeman , whose name I do n't know , and Miss Julia Dodd . The policemen helped me lift Captain Dodd off the grass , sir ; Julia met us chose by , and we four carried Dr. Wycherhey 's phantom home together to Albion Villa . ”
227976	227984	227973	227974	Dr. Wycherley	659	“ What do you say to that ? ”
227985	227995	227997	227998	the doctor	8653	“ I say it is a very important statement , ”
228001	228023	227997	227998	the doctor	8653	“ and that I am sure my young friend would not advance it unless he was firmly persuaded of its reality . ”
228024	228069	227973	227974	Dr. Wycherley	659	“ Much obliged , doctor ; and you would not contradict me so rashly in a matter I know all about and you know nothing about , if it was not your fixed habit to found facts on theories instead of theories on facts . ”
228070	228077	228079	228080	Mr. Abbott	829	“ There , that is enough , ”
228082	228108	228079	228080	Mr. Abbott	829	“ I have brought you both to an issue at last . I shall send to Barkington , and examine the policemen and the Dodds . ”
228109	228117	228119	228119	Alfred	312	“ Oh , thank you , sir , ”
228123	228144	228119	228119	Alfred	312	“ If you once apply genuine tests like that to my case , I shall not be long in prison . ”
228145	228148	228150	228150	Wycherley	659	“ Prison ? ”
228153	228168	228170	228171	Dr. Eskell	826	“ Have you any complaint , then , to make of your treatment here ? ”
228173	228180	228182	228182	Alfred	312	“ No , no , sir , ”
228185	228332	228182	228182	Alfred	312	“ Dr. Wycherley is the very soul of humanity . Here are no tortures , no handcuffs nor leg - locks , no brutality , no insects that murder Sleep — without offence to Logic . In my last asylum the attendants inflicted violence , here they are only allowed to endure it . And , gentlemen , I must tell you a noble trait in my enemy there : nothing can make him angry with madmen ; their lies , their groundless and narrow suspicions of him , their deplorable ingratitude to him , of which I see examples every day that rile me on his account ; all these things seem to glide off him , baffled by the infinite kindness of his heart and the incomparable sweetness of his temper ; and he returns the duffers good for evil with scarcely an effort . ”
228376	228380	228382	228382	Alfred	312	“ In short , ”
228384	228433	228382	228382	Alfred	312	“ to be happy in his house all a man wants is to be insane . But , as I am not insane , I am miserable ; no convict , no galley slave is so wretched as I am , gentlemen . And what is my crime ? ”
228434	228439	228441	228442	Dr. Eskell	826	“ Well , well , ”
228445	228459	228441	228442	Dr. Eskell	826	“ I think it likely you will not be very long in confinement . ”
228519	228558	228512	228513	The doctor	8653	“ However , gentlemen , you have heard him : now judge for yourselves whether anybody can be as clever as he is , without the presence of more or less abnormal excitement of the organs of intelligence . ”
228955	228966	228968	228969	Mr. Abbott	829	“ I have heard a good deal of your story , ”
228971	229002	228968	228969	Mr. Abbott	829	“ and coupling it with what we have seen of you , we think your relatives have treated you , and a young lady of whom everybody speaks with respect — ”
229003	229015	228968	228969	Mr. Abbott	829	“ God bless you for saying that ! God bless you ! ”
229016	229029	228968	228969	Mr. Abbott	829	“ — treated you both , I say , with needless severity . ”
229045	229053	229055	229055	he	826	“ I believe you to be cured , ”
229057	229105	229055	229055	he	826	“ and Mr. Abbott has some doubts whether you were ever positively insane . We shall lay your case before the Board at once , and the Board will write to the party who signed the order , and propose to him to discharge you at once . ”
229121	229140	229116	229116	he	312	“ What ! have you not the power to do me justice without soliciting Injustice to help you ? ”
229141	229148	229150	229151	Dr. Eskell	826	“ The Board has the power , ”
229153	229198	229150	229151	Dr. Eskell	826	“ but for many reasons they exercise it with prudence and reserve . Besides , it is only fair to those who have signed the order , to give them the graceful office of liberating the patient ; it paves the way to reconciliation . ”
229228	229231	229233	229234	Mr. Abbott	829	“ Then , ”
229237	229248	229233	229234	Mr. Abbott	829	“ you will see your case is not being neglected . ”
230390	230394	230379	230379	He	312	“ Hamlet was mad ”

231042	231054	231056	231056	he	312	“ I believe the bloke was no madder than I am , ”
231516	231519	231521	231521	he	312	“ Doctor , ”
231523	231550	231521	231521	he	312	“ I have been thinking over your arguments , and I capitulate . If Hamlet ever existed , he was as mad as a March hare . ”
231566	231610	231560	231561	Dr. Wycherley	659	“ My young friend , this gives me sincere pleasure ; not on my account , but on your own . There goes one of your illusions then . Now tell me — the 4,000l . ! Have you calmly reconsidered that too ? ”
231622	231625	231627	231627	he	312	“ Why , ”
231629	231691	231627	231627	he	312	“ that never amounted to anything more than a strong suspicion . It has long ceased to occupy my mind in excess . However , should I ever be so fortunate as to recover my liberty , I have no objection to collect the evidence about it pro and con . , and then make you the judge instead of myself . ”
231702	231708	231710	231711	the doctor	8653	“ Very well , sir , ”
231714	231728	231710	231711	the doctor	8653	“ Then , now I have a piece of good news for you . “
231737	231738	231731	231731	doctor	8892	” “
231761	231800	231801	231801	I	0	” Alfred was a little disappointed at this piece of news ; but recovering himself , asked him to certify that and let him send the certificate to the Board . Dr. Wycherley said he would with pleasure . “
231813	231901	231801	231801	I	0	” said he . Alfred retired triumphant , and went in at Plato with a good heart . In about an hour Dr. Wycherley paid him the promised visit . But what may not an hour bring forth ? He came with mortification and regret in his face to tell Alfred that an order of transfer had been signed by the proper parties , and counter - signed by two Commissioners , and he was to go to Dr. Wolf 's asylum that day . Alfred groaned . “
231917	231921	231904	231905	my father	1958	” said he . “

232101	232105	232098	232099	dear doctor	6344	” said Alfred . “
232161	232171	232173	232173	he	312	“ We shall never meet again , I fear , ”

232296	232308	232309	232309	he	854	“ Oh if I could be as ragged as you are , ”

232777	232814	232816	232816	he	312	“ Oh , my ring has a peculiar virtue , it tells me what is good for me . Ah ! what do I see ? My ruby changes colour . Fetch me a clean glass . ”
232825	232849	232816	232816	he	312	“ No , sir , leave the beer . I 'll analyse it in my room after dinner . I 'm a chemist . ”
233041	233047	233031	233032	Dr. Wolf	854	“ Let me introduce you , ”

233565	233601	233562	233562	she	742	“ His power over me is too terrible . Ah , good - bye to the peace and comfort I have been building up ! He will scatter them to the winds . He has . ”

234812	234842	234904	234905	Mrs. Archbold	742	“ Oh , thank you ; then pray send for Nurse Eliza , and hear the cruelties that are being done to the patients within a yard of us . ”
234843	234860	234787	234788	Mrs. Archbold	742	“ You had better tell me yourself , if you want me to pay any attention . ”
234861	234903	234904	234905	Mrs. Archbold	742	“ I ca n't . I do n't know how to speak to a lady of such things as are done here . The brutes ! the cowardly she - devils ! Oh , how I should like to kill them . ”

234957	235013	234953	234953	she	417	“ they have just been tanking one they had no business to touch ; it is Mrs. Dale , her that is so close on her confinement . They tanked her cruel they did , and kept her under water till she was nigh gone . I came away ; I could n't stand it . ”
235062	235132	235054	235054	he	312	“ Mrs. Archbold , you are strong and brave — for a woman ; oh , do go in to them and take them by the throat and shake the life out of them , the merciless , cowardly beasts ! Oh that I could be a woman for an hour , or they could be men , I 'd soon have my foot on some of the wretches . ”
235138	235146	235147	235147	she	742	“ Come with me both of you , ”

236253	237390	237407	237407	I	0	” All that Alfred could do for these victims was to promise to try and get them out some day , D.V. But there was a weak - minded youth , Francis Beverley , who had the honour to be under the protection of the Lord Chancellor . Now a lunatic or a Softy , protected by that functionary , is literally a lamb protected by a wolf , and that wolf ex officio the cruellest , cunningest old mangler and fleecer of innocents in Christendom . Chancery lunatics are the richest class , yet numbers of them are flung among pauper and even criminal lunatics , at a few pounds a year , while their committees bag four - fifths of the money that has been assigned to keep the patient in comfort . Unfortunately the protection of the Chancellor extends to Life and Reason , as well as Fleece ; with the following result : In public asylums about forty per cent . are said to be cured . In private ones twenty - five per cent , at least ; most of them poorish . Of Chancery Lunatics not five per cent . Finally , one - third of all the Chancery Lunatics do every six years exchange the living tombs they are fleeced and bullied in for dead tombs where they rest ; and go from the sham protection of the Lord Chancellor of England to the real protection of their Creator and their Judge . These statistics have been long before the world , and are dead figures to the Skimmer of things , but tell a dark tale to the Reader of things , so dark , that I pray Heaven to protect me , and all other weak inoffensive persons , from the protection of my Lord Chancellor in this kind . Beverley was so unfortunate as to exist before the date of the above petition : and suffered the consequences . He was an aristocrat by birth , noble on both sides of his house , and unluckily had money . But for that he would have been a labouring man , and free . My Lord Protector committed him with six hundred pounds a year maintenance money to the care of his committee , the Honourable Fynes Beverley . Now this corporate , yet honourable individual , to whom something was committed , and so Chancery Lane called him in its own sweet French the thing committed , was a gentleman of birth , breeding , and intelligence . He undertook to take care of his simple cousin ; and what he did take care of was himself . 1 . The Honourable Fynes Beverley , Anglo - French committee , or crown tenant , sub - let soft Francis for 300l . a year , pocketed 300,l . and washed his hands of Frank . 2 . Mr. Heselden , the sub - tenant , sub - let the Softy of high degree for 150,l . pocketed the surplus , and washed his hands of him . 3 . The 150l . man sub - let him to Dr. Wolf at 60l . a year , pouched the surplus , and washed his hands of him . And now what on earth was left for poor Dr. Wolf to do ? Could he sub - embezzle a Highlander 's breeks ? Could he subtract more than her skin from off the singed cat ? Could he peel the core of a rotten apple ? Could he pare a grated cheese rind ? Could he flay a skinned flint ? Could he fleece a hog after Satan had shaved it as clean as a bantam 's egg ? Let no man dare to limit genius ; least of all the genius of extortion . Dr. Wolf screwed comparatively more out of young Frank than did any of the preceding screws . He turned him into a servant of all work and half starved him ; money profit , 45l . out of the 60,l . or three - fourths , whereas the others had only bagged one - half . But by this means he got a good servant without wages , and on half a servant 's food , clearing 22l . and 12l . in these two items . Victim of our great national vice and foible , Vicariousness , this scion of a noble house , protected in theory by the Crown , vicariously sub - protected by the Chancellor , sub - vicariously sub - sham protected by his kin , was really flung unprotected into the fleece market , and might be seen — at the end of the long chain of subs . pros , vices , locos , shams , shuffles , swindles , and lies — shaking the carpets , making the beds , carrying the water , sweeping the rooms , and scouring the sordid vessels , of thirty patients in Drayton House , not one of whom was his equal either in birth or wealth ; and of four menials , who were all his masters and hard ones . His work was always doing , never done . He was not the least mad nor bad , but merely of feeble intellect all round . Fifty thousand gentlemen 's families would have been glad of him at 300l . a year , and made a son and a brother of him . But he was under the vicarious protection of the Lord Chancellor . Thin , half - starved , threadbare , out at elbows , the universal butt , scoffed at by the very lunatics , and especially ill treated by the attendants whose work he did gratis , he was sworn at , jeered , insulted , cuffed and even kicked , every day of his hard , hard life . And yet he was a gentleman , though a soft one ; his hands , his features , his carriage , his address , had all an indefinable stamp of race . How had it outlived such crushing , degrading usage ? I do n't know ; how does a daisy survive the iron roller ? Alfred soon found him out , and to everybody 's amazement , especially Frank 's , remonstrated gently but resolutely and eloquently , and soon convinced the majority , sane and insane , that a creature so meek and useful merited special kindness , not cruelty . One keeper , The Robin , alias Tom Wales , an ex — prize fighter , was a warm convert to this view . Among the maniacs only one held out , and said contemptuously he could n't see it . “
237393	237397	237407	237407	I	0	” said Alfred , “
237421	237517	237407	237407	I	0	” Rooke and Hayes treated remonstrance with open and galling contempt . Yet the tide of opinion changed so , they did not care to defy it openly : but they bullied poor Beverley now and then on the sly , and he never told . He was too inoffensive for this world . But one day , as Alfred was sitting with his door ajar , writing a letter of earnest expostulation to the Commissioners , who had left his first unanswered , he heard Hayes at the head of the stairs call roughly , “
237522	237523	237520	237520	Frank	868	” “
237526	237536	237524	237524	Sir	1075	” replied the soft little voice of young Beverley . “
237545	237546	237542	237543	young shaver	6502	” “
237553	237559	237551	237551	sir	1075	” and up ran Beverley . “
237567	237568	237571	237571	sir	1075	” “
237573	237574	237571	237571	sir	1075	” “
237586	237604	237571	237571	sir	1075	” And Hayes chucked him a crust , as one throws it to another man 's dog . “
237610	237639	237608	237608	sir	1075	” said Mr. Beverley , stooping down for it , and being habitually as hungry as a ratcatcher 's tyke , took an eager bite in that position . “
237647	237652	237642	237642	you	0	” said Hayes brutally : “
237664	238052	237662	237662	mizzle	6508	” And with that lent him a contemptuous kick behind , which owing to his position sent him off his balance flat on the tray ; a glass broke under him . Poor young Mr. Beverley uttered a cry of dismay , for he knew Hayes would not own himself the cause . Hayes cursed him for an awkward idiot , and the oath went off into a howl , for Alfred ran out at him brimful of Moses , and with a savage kick in the back and blow on the neck , administered simultaneously , hurled him head foremost down the stairs . Alighting on the seventh step , he turned a somersault , and bounded like a ball on to the landing below , and there lay stupefied . He picked himself up by slow degrees , and glared round with speechless awe and amazement up at the human thunderbolt that had shot out on him and sent him flying like a feather . He shook his fist , and limped silently away all bruises and curses , to tell Rooke and concert vengeance . Alfred , trembling still with ire , took Beverley to his room ( the boy was as white as a sheet ) , and encouraged him , and made him wash properly , brushed his hair , dressed him in a decent tweed suit he had outgrown , and taking him under his arm , and walking with his own nose haughtily in the air , paraded him up and down the asylum , to show them all the best man in the house respected the poor soft gentleman . Ah , what a grand thing it is to be young ! Beverley clung to his protector too much like a girl , but walked gracefully and kept step , and every now and then looked up at Alfred with a loving adoration , that was sweet , yet sad to see . Alfred marched him to Mrs. Archbold , and told his tale ; for he knew Hayes would misrepresent it , and get him into trouble . She smiled on the pair ; gently deplored her favourite 's impetuosity , entreated him not to go fighting with that great monster Rooke , and charmed him by saying , “
238068	238069	238056	238056	Frank	868	” “
238074	238079	238072	238072	he	868	” said Alfred eagerly . “
238109	238110	238112	238112	yours	6513	” “
238119	238149	238112	238112	yours	6513	” was the honeyed reply . In vain did Mr. Hayes prefer his complaint to Dr. Wolf . The Archbold had been before him , and the answer was , “
238154	238234	238112	238112	yours	6513	” These and many other good deeds did Alfred Hardie in Drayton House . But , as the days rolled on , and no answer came from the Commissioners , his own anxiety , grief , and dismay left him less and less able to sympathise with the material but smaller wrongs around him . He became silent , dejected . At last he came to Mrs. Archbold , and said sternly his letters to the Commissioners were intercepted . “
238241	238245	238235	238235	I	0	” said she . “
238252	238264	238265	238265	I	0	” So it was : but law and custom are two . “
238271	238275	238265	238265	I	0	” said he ; “
238295	238321	238322	238322	I	0	” And he stalked gloomily away . When he left her , she sighed at this imprecation from his lips ; but did not repent . “
238329	238334	238322	238322	I	0	” she said despairingly ; “
238349	238594	238346	238346	Wolf	854	” and the amorous crocodile shed a tear , and persisted in her double - faced course . By - and - by , when she saw him getting thinner and paler , and his bright face downcast and inexpressibly sad , she shared his misery : ay , shed scalding tears for him : yet could not give him up ; for her will was as strong as the rest of her was supple ; and hers was hot love , but not true love like Julia 's . Perhaps a very subtle observer , seeing this man and woman wax pale and spiritless together in one house , might have divined her secret . Dr. Wolf , then , was no such observer , for she made him believe she had a rising penchant for him . He really had a strong one for her . While Alfred 's visible misery pulled at her heart - strings , and sometimes irritated , sometimes melted her , came curious complications ; one of which requires preface . Mrs. Dodd then was not the wife to trust blindly where her poor husband was concerned . She bribed so well that a keeperess in David 's first asylum told her David had been harshly used by an attendant . She instantly got Eve Dodd to take him away : and transfer him to a small asylum nearer London , and kept by a Mrs. Ellis . “
238602	239143	238595	238595	Women	1149	” said the sagacious Lucy Dodd . But , alas ! if women are not cruel where sex comes in and mimics that wider sentiment , Humanity , women are deadly economical . Largely gifted with that household virtue , Mrs. Ellis kept too few servants , and , sure consequence in a madhouse , too many straitjackets , hobbles , muffs , leg - locks , bodybelts , & c. & c. Hence half her patients were frequently kept out of harm 's way by cruel restraints administered , not out of hearty cruelty , but female parsimony . Mrs. and Miss Dodd invaded the house one day when the fair economist was out , and found seven patients out of the twelve kept out of mischief thus : one in a restraint chair , two hobbled like asses , two chained like dogs , and two in straight - waistcoats , and fastened to beds by webbing and straps ; amongst the latter , David , though quiet as a lamb . Mrs. Dodd cried over him as if her heart would break , and made Miss Dodd shift him to a large asylum , where I believe he was very well used . But here those dreadful newspapers interfered ; a prying into sweet secluded spots . They diversified Mrs. Dodd 's breakfast by informing her that the doctor of this asylum had just killed a patient ; the mode of execution bloodless and sure , as became fair science . It was a man between sixty and seventy ; an age at which the heart can seldom stand very much shocking , or lowering , especially where the brain is diseased . So they placed him in a shower - bath , narrow enough to impede respiration , without the falling water , which of necessity drives out air . In short a vertical box with holes all round the top . Here the doctor ordered him a cold shower - bath of unparalleled duration : half an hour . To be followed by an unprecedented dose of tartar emetic . This double - barrelled order given , the doctor went away . ( Formula . ) The water was down to forty - five degrees Fahrenheit . Half an hour 's shower - bath at that temperature in a roomy bath would kill the youngest and strongest man in her Majesty 's dominions . For eight - and - twenty mortal minutes the poor old man stood in this vertical coffin under this cold cascade . Six hundred gallons of icy water were in that his last hour , his last half - hour , discharged upon his devoted head and doomed body . He had to be helped away from this death - torrent he had walked into in high spirits , poor soul . Even this change awakened no misgivings , no remorse ; though you or I , or any man or woman picked at hazard out of the streets , would at once have seen that he was dying , he was duly dozed by the fire with four spoonfuls of antimonial tincture — to mak ' sicker . But even the “
239148	239198	238595	238595	Women	1149	” can not slay the slain . The old man cheated the emetic ; for , before it could hurt him , he died of the bath ; And his body told its own sad tale ; to use the words of a medical eye - witness , it was “
239204	239314	238595	238595	Women	1149	” The death - torrent had driven the whole circulation from the surface . Mrs. Dodd was terrified , and in spite of Sampson 's assurance that this was the asylum of all others they would not settle another patient in until the matter should have blown over , got Eve Dodd to write to Dr. Wolf , and offer 300l . a year if he would take David at once , and treat him with especial consideration . He showed this letter triumphantly to Mrs. Archbold , and she , blinded for a moment by feeling , dissuaded him from receiving Captain Dodd . He stared at her . “
239325	239326	238595	238595	Women	1149	” “
239340	239341	239328	239328	they	6518	” “
239372	239518	239362	239362	I	0	” One day Alfred found himself locked into his room . This was unusual : for , though they called him a lunatic in words , they called him sane by all their acts . He half suspected that the Commissioners were in the house . Had he known who really was in the house , he would have beaten himself to pieces against the door . At dinner there was a new patient , very mild and silent , with a beautiful large brown eye , like some gentle animal 's . Alfred was very much struck with this eye , and contrived to say a kind word to him after dinner . Finding himself addressed by a gentleman , the new comer handled his forelock and made a sea scrape , and announced himself as William Thompson ; he added with simple pride , “
239522	239529	239519	239520	Able Seaman	6521	” then touching his forelock again , “
239537	239679	239519	239520	Able Seaman	6521	” After this , which came off glibly , he was anything but communicative . However , Alfred contrived to extract from him that he was rather glad to leave his last ship , on account of having been constantly impeded there in his duties by a set of lubbers , that clung round him and kept him on deck whenever the first lieutenant ordered him into the top . The very next day , pacing sadly the dull gravel of his prison yard , Alfred heard a row ; and there was the able seaman struggling with the Robin and two other keepers . He wanted to go to his duties in the foretop : to wit , the fork of a high elm - tree in the court - yard . Alfred had half a mind not to interfere . “
239686	239807	239813	239813	he	6523	” he said . But his better nature prevailed , and he told the Robin he was sure going up imaginary rigging would do Thompson more good than harm . On this the men reluctantly gave him a trial , and he went up the tree with wonderful strength and agility , but evident caution . Still Alfred quaked when he crossed his thighs tight over a limb of the tree forty feet from earth , and went carefully and minutely through the whole process of furling imaginary sails . However , he came down manifestly soothed by the performance , and , singular phenomenon , he was quite cool ; and it was the spectators on deck who perspired . “
239816	239820	239813	239813	he	6523	” said Alfred ; “
239843	239844	239841	239841	myself	0	” “
239863	239868	239813	239813	he	6523	” said the Robin ; “
239882	240169	239877	239877	he	6523	” At night Alfred dreamed he heard Julia 's sweet mellow voice speaking to him ; and he looked , and lo ! it was the able seaman . He could sleep no more , but lay sighing . Ere the able seaman had been there three days , Mrs. Dodd came unexpectedly to see him ; and it was with the utmost difficulty Alfred was smuggled out of the way . Mrs. Archbold saw by her loving anxiety these visits would be frequent , and , unless Alfred was kept constantly locked up , which was repugnant to her , they would meet some day . She knew there are men who ply the trade of spies , and where to find them ; she set one of them to watch Mrs. Dodd 's house , and learn her habits , in hopes of getting some clue as to when she might be expected . Now it so happened that , looking for one thing , she found another which gave her great hopes and courage . And then the sight of Alfred 's misery tried her patience , and then he was beginning half to suspect her of stopping his letters . Passion , impatience , pity , and calculation , all drove her the same road , and led to an extraordinary scene , so impregnated with the genius of the madhouse — a place where the passions run out to the very end of their tether — that I feel little able to describe it . I will try and indicate it . One fine Sunday afternoon , then , she asked Alfred languidly would he like to walk in the country . “
240183	240193	240180	240181	a prisoner	11555	” said he sorrowfully . She shook her head . “
240258	240259	240253	240253	I	0	” “
240286	240693	240274	240274	I	0	” The accomplished dissembler hesitated , yielded . They passed through the yard and out at the back door , which Alfred had so often looked wistfully at ; and by - and - by reached a delicious pasture . A light golden haze streamed across it . Nature never seemed so sweet , so divine , to Alfred before ; the sun as bright as midsummer , though not the least hot , the air fresh , yet genial , and perfumed with Liberty and the smaller flowers of earth . Beauty glided rustling by his side , and dark eyes subdued their native fire into softness whenever they turned on him ; and scarce fifty yards in the rear hung a bully and a mastiff ready to tear him down if he should break away from beauty 's light hand , that rested so timidly on his . He was young , and stout - hearted , and relished his peep of liberty and nature , though blotted by Vulcan and Rooke . He chatted to Mrs. Archbold in good spirits . She answered briefly , and listlessly . At last she stopped under a young chestnut - tree as if overcome with a sudden reflection , and turning half away from him leaned her head and hand upon a bough , and sighed . The attitude was pensive and womanly . He asked her with innocent concern what was the matter ; then faintly should he take her home . All her answer was to press his hand with hers that was disengaged , and , instead of sighing , to cry . The novice in woman 's wiles set himself to comfort her — in vain ; to question her — in vain at first ; but by degrees she allowed him to learn that it was for him she mourned ; and so they proceeded on the old , old plan , the man extorting from the woman bit by bit just so much as she wanted all along to say , and would have poured in a stream if let quite alone . He drew from his distressed friend that Dr. Wolf for reasons of his own had made special inquiries about the Dodds ; that she had fortunately or unfortunately heard of this , and had questioned the person employed , hoping to hear something that might comfort Alfred . “
240698	240702	240274	240274	I	0	” said she , “
240722	240723	240726	240726	you	0	” “
240729	240736	240726	240726	you	0	” said Alfred , trembling suddenly . “
240758	240759	240746	240746	I	0	” “
240766	240770	240772	240772	me	0	” gasped Alfred ; “
240776	240777	240779	240779	I	0	” “
240815	240816	240812	240813	a beau	4126	” “
240822	240827	240812	240813	a beau	4126	” cried Alfred furiously . “
240898	241211	241212	241212	Alfred	312	” At these words a cold sickness rushed all over Alfred , beginning at his heart . He stood white and stupefied a moment ; then , in the anguish of his heart , broke out into a great and terrible cry ; it was like a young lion wounded with a poisoned shaft . Then he was silent , and stood stock still , like petrified despair . Mrs. Archbold was prepared for an outburst : but not of this kind . His anguish was so unlike a woman 's that it staggered her . Her good and bad angels , to use an expressive though somewhat too poetical phrase , battled for her . She had an impulse to earn his gratitude for life , to let him out of the asylum ere Julia should be Mrs. Hurd , and even liberty come too late for true love . She looked again at the statue of grief by her side ; and burst out crying in earnest . This was unfortunate . Shallow pity exuding in salt water leaves not enough behind to gush forth in good deeds . She only tried to undo her own work in part ; to comfort him a little with commonplaces . She told him in a soothing whisper there were other women in the world besides this inconstant girl , others who could love him as he deserved . He made no answer to all she could say , but just waved his hand once impatiently . Petty consolation seemed to sting him . She drew back discouraged ; but only for a while . He was silent . With one grand serpentine movement she came suddenly close to him , and , standing half behind him , laid her hand softly on his shoulder , and poured burning love in his ear . “
241214	241218	241212	241212	Alfred	312	” she murmured , “
241362	241363	241339	241339	Alfred	312	” “
241385	241386	241373	241373	You	742	” “
241619	241694	241605	241605	I	0	” The passionate woman paused at last , but her hot cheek and heaving bosom and tender convulsive hand prolonged the pleading . I am afraid few men of her own age would have resisted her ; for voice and speech and all burning , melting , and winning ; and then , so reasonable , lads ; she did not stipulate for constancy . But Alfred turned round to her blushing and sorrowful . “
241698	241702	241708	241708	you	312	” he said ; “
241778	241779	241780	241780	You	312	” “
241785	241789	241780	241780	You	312	” she sobbed . “
241798	241804	241792	241792	I	0	” said he more gently . “
241903	241918	241919	241919	You	0	” Mrs. Archbold was white with ire long before he had done this sentence . “
241923	241927	241928	241928	you	0	” said she ; “
241939	241940	241942	241942	I	0	” “
241945	241950	241942	241942	I	0	” said he coldly : “
241960	241961	241942	241942	I	0	” “
241965	241969	241942	241942	I	0	” said she : “
242009	242010	242011	242011	I	0	” “
242017	242025	242011	242011	I	0	” said Alfred , feeling rather uneasy . “
242028	242032	242035	242035	you	0	” said she , “
242065	242066	242052	242052	he	868	” “
242076	242077	242069	242069	his	868	” “
242164	242165	242156	242156	you	0	” “
242174	242181	242182	242182	I	0	” he inquired with a sneer . “
242188	242200	242182	242182	I	0	” She hissed this fiendish threat out between her white teeth . “
242205	242209	242182	242182	I	0	” she said , “
242282	242295	242297	242297	I	0	” At this furious threat Alfred ground his teeth , and said , “
242333	242334	242313	242313	I	0	” “
242342	242348	242313	242313	I	0	” said the Archbold contemptuously ; “
242390	242419	242420	242420	We	6574	” AFTER a defiance so bitter and deadly , Alfred naturally drew away from his inamorata . But she , boiling with love and hate , said bitterly , “
242437	242519	242432	242432	sir	1075	” He stuck it out ungraciously , and averted his head ; she took it , suppressed with difficulty a petty desire to pinch , and so walked by his side . He was as much at his ease as if promenading jungles with a panther . She felt him quiver with repugnance under her soft hand ; and prolonged the irritating contact . She walked very slowly , and told him with much meaning she was waiting for a signal . “
242523	242527	242432	242432	sir	1075	” said she , “
242535	242613	242432	242432	sir	1075	” biting the word with her teeth as it went out . By - and - by a window was opened in the asylum , and a table - cloth hung out . Mrs. Archbold pointed it out to Alfred ; he stared at it ; and after that she walked him rapidly home in silence . But , as soon as the door was double - locked on him , she whispered triumphantly in his ear — “
242637	242638	242639	242644	My mother - in - law	6579	” “
242646	242663	242639	242644	My mother - in - law	6579	” cried the young man , and tried in vain to conceal his surprise and agitation . “
242681	242682	242678	242679	Mrs. Dodd	253	” “
242687	242703	242683	242684	Mrs. Dodd	253	” said Alfred , clasping his hands . Then he reflected , and said coolly : “
242715	242716	242710	242710	she	253	” “
242726	242727	242719	242724	your father - in - law	6581	” “
242743	242751	242738	242738	he	6582	” said Alfred with an incredulous sneer . “
242786	242804	242805	242806	Poor man	10453	” Alfred was now utterly amazed , and bewildered . Mrs. Archbold eyed him in silent scorn . “
242808	242820	242805	242806	Poor man	10453	” said he at last ; and hung his head sorrowfully . “
242845	242846	242824	242824	his	6582	” “
242858	242890	242824	242824	his	6582	” hissed the viper . At this moment Beverley appeared at the end of the yard . Mrs. Archbold whistled him to her like a dog . He came running zealously . “
242900	242904	242905	242907	A polite lady	6589	” she inquired . “
242921	242922	242911	242911	she	6589	” “
242929	242935	242926	242927	Mrs. Dodd	253	” said the Archbold quietly . “
242940	242944	242949	242949	her	6589	” continued Frank , “
242960	242961	242950	242953	a beautiful young lady	6592	” “
242966	242998	242962	242964	Miss Julia Dodd	255	” said the Archbold grimly . Alfred panted , and his eyes roved wildly in search of a way to escape and follow her ; she could not be far off . “
243004	243009	243002	243002	Frank	868	” inquired Mrs. Archbold . “
243037	243038	243028	243028	he	6596	” “
243070	243129	243130	243130	You	6589	” At these words , every one of them an adder , Alfred turned on her furiously , and his long arm shot out of its own accord , and the fingers opened like an eagle 's claw . She saw , and understood , but never blenched . Her vindictive eye met his dilating flashing orbs unflinchingly . “
243136	243140	243130	243130	You	6589	” he said , “
243149	243219	243130	243130	You	6589	” He turned from her with a deep convulsive sob , and , almost staggering , leaned his brow against the wall of the house . She had done what no man had as yet succeeded in ; she had broken his spirit . And here a man would have left him alone . But the rejected beauty put her lips to his ear , and whispered into them , “
243226	243393	243130	243130	You	6589	” Then she left him and went to his room and stole all his paper , and pens , and ink , and his very Aristotle . He was to have no occupation now , except to brood , and brood , and brood . As for Alfred , he sat down upon a bench in the yard a broken man : up to this moment he had hoped his Julia was as constant as himself . But no ; either she had heard he was mad , and with the universal credulity had believed it , or perhaps , not hearing from him at all believed herself forsaken ; and was consoling herself with a clergyman . Jealousy did not as yet infuriate Alfred . Its first effect resembled that of a heavy blow . Little Beverley found him actually sick , and ran to the Robin . The ex - prizefighter brought him a thimbleful of brandy , but he would not take it . “
243400	243404	243130	243130	You	6589	” he said , “
243426	243465	243130	243130	You	6589	” The Robin retired muttering . Little Beverley kneeled down beside him , and kissed his hand with a devotion that savoured of the canine . Yet it was tender , and the sinking heart clung to it . “
243470	243474	243468	243468	Frank	868	” he cried , “
243527	243581	243582	243582	I	0	” He moaned , and young Frank sorrowed over him , till the harsh voice of Rooke summoned him to some menial duty . This discharged , he came running back ; and sat on the bench beside his crushed benefactor without saying a word . At last he delivered this sapient speech : “
243594	243600	243585	243585	You	6604	” Alfred only sighed hopelessly . “
243610	243619	243602	243602	I	0	” said Frank . Alfred shook his head . “
243625	243740	243622	243622	me	0	” said Frank solemnly ; and he sat silent looking like a young owl : for thinking soon puzzled him , and elicited his intellectual weakness , whereas in a groove of duties he could go as smoothly as half the world , and but for his official , officious Protector , might just as well have been Boots at the Swan , as Boots and Chambermaid at the Wolf . So now force and cunning had declared war on Alfred , and feebleness in person enlisted in his defence . His adversary lost no time ; that afternoon Rooke told him he was henceforth to occupy a double bedded room with another patient . “
243766	243968	243764	243764	you	6608	” said the keeper with a malicious smile . The patient turned out to be the able seaman . Here Mrs. Archbold aimed a double stroke ; to shake Alfred 's nerves , and show him how very mad his proposed father - in - law was . She thought that , if he could once be forced to realise this , it might reconcile him to not marrying the daughter . The first night David did get up and paraded an imaginary deck for four mortal hours . Alfred 's sleep was broken ; but he said nothing , and David turned in again , his watch completed . Not a day passed now but a blow was struck . Nor was the victim passive ; debarred writing materials , he cut the rims off several copies of the Times , and secreted them : then catching sight of some ink - blots on the back of Frank 's clothes - brush , scraped them carefully off , melted them in a very little water , and with a toothpick scrawled his wrongs to the Commissioners ; he rolled the slips round a half - crown , and wrote outside , “
243994	244143	244144	244144	You	6610	” This done , he watched , and when nobody was looking , flung his letter , so weighted , over the gates ; he heard it fall on the public road . Another day he secreted a spoonful of black currant preserve , diluted it with a little water , and wrote a letter , and threw it into the road as before : another day , hearing the Robin express disgust at the usage to which he was now subjected , he drew him apart , and offered him a hundred pounds to get him out . Now the ex - prizefighter was rather a tender - hearted fellow , and a great detester of foul play . What he saw made him now side heartily with Alfred ; and all he wanted was to be indemnified for his risk . He looked down and said , “
244159	244167	244144	244144	You	6610	” Alfred offered him two hundred pounds . “
244176	244181	244144	244144	You	6610	” said the Robin ; “
244229	244244	244216	244216	him	878	” Alfred jumped at the proposal : he would give them two hundred apiece . “
244250	244255	244245	244245	I	0	” said the Robin ; “
244288	244428	244280	244280	he	878	” One fine morning the house was made much cleaner than usual ; the rotatory chair , in which they used to spin a maniac like a teetotum , the restraint chairs , and all the paraphernalia were sent into the stable , and so disposed that , even if found , they would look like things scorned and dismissed from service : for Wolf , mind you , professed the non - restraint system . Alfred asked what was up , and found all this was in preparation for the quarterly visit of the Commissioners : a visit intended to be a surprise ; but Drayton House always knew when they were coming , and the very names of the two thunderbolts that thought to surprise them . Mrs. Archbold communicated her knowledge in off - hand terms . “
244440	244548	244438	244438	Terry	881	” The gentlemen thus flatteringly heralded arrived next day . One an aged , infirm man , with a grand benevolent head , bald front and silver hair , and the gold - headed cane of his youth , now a dignified crutch : the other an ordinary looking little chap enough , with this merit — he was what he looked . They had a long interview with Mrs. Archbold first , for fear they should carry a naked eye into the asylum . Mr. Bartlett , acting on instructions , very soon inquired about Alfred ; Mrs. Archbold 's face put on friendly concern directly . “
244615	244631	244602	244602	he	6616	” In short , she gave them the impression that Alfred was a moping melancholiac . “
244640	244645	244634	244634	I	0	” said Mr. Bartlett , “
244652	244733	244734	244734	You	6622	” Alfred was accordingly sent for , and asked with an indifferent air how he was . He said he was very well in health , but in sore distress of mind at his letters to the Commissioners being intercepted by Mrs. Archbold or Dr. Wolf . Mrs. Archbold smiled pityingly . Mr. Bartlett caught her glance , and concluded this was one of the patient 's delusions . ( Formula . ) Alfred surprised the glances , and said , “
244805	244806	244856	244856	she	742	” “
244815	244833	244856	244856	she	742	” said Mr. Bartlett , and made the note . Mrs. Archbold looked rather discomposed at that . “
244839	244843	244845	244846	Mrs. Archbold	742	” said Alfred , “
244878	244879	244880	244880	You	0	” “
244898	245001	244880	244880	You	0	” said Mrs. Archbold , rising white with ire and apprehension , and sweeping out of the room . By this piece of female petulance she gave the enemy a point in the game ; for , if she had insisted on staying , Mr. Bartlett was far too weak to have dismissed her . As it was , he felt shocked at Alfred 's rudeness : and so small a thing as justice did not in his idea counterbalance so great a thing as discourtesy ; so he listened to Alfred 's tale with the deadly apathy of an unwilling hearer . “
245009	245178	245179	245180	Noble adversary	6628	” as poor Lear says . As for Dr. Terry , he was pictorial , but null ; effete ; emptied of brains by all - scooping - Time . If he had been detained that day at Drayton House , and Frank Beverley sent back in his place to Whitehall , it would have mattered little to him , less to the nation , and nothing to mankind . At last Mr. Bartlett gave Alfred some hopes he was taking in the truth ; for he tore a leaf out of his memorandum - book , wrote on it , and passed it to Dr. Terry . The ancient took it with a smile , and seemed to make an effort to master it , but failed ; it dropped simultaneously from his finger and his mind . Not a question was put to Alfred ; so he was fain to come to an end ; he withdrew suddenly , and caught Mrs. Archbold at the keyhole . “
245182	245416	245179	245180	Noble adversary	6628	” said he , and stalked away , and hid himself hard by : and no sooner did the inspectors come out , and leave the coast clear , than he darted in and looked for the paper Mr. Bartlett had passed to Dr. Terry . He found it on the floor : and took it eagerly up ; and full of hope , and expectation , read these words : WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE STUFF THE MATRON 'S GOWN IS MADE OF ? I SHOULD LIKE TO BUY MRS . BARTLETT ONE LIKE IT . Alfred stood and read this again , and again he searched for some hidden symbolical meaning in the words . High - minded , and deeply impressed with his own wrongs , he could not conceive a respectable man , paid fifteen hundred a year to spy out wrongs , being so heartless hard as to write this single comment during the earnest recital of a wrong so gigantic as his . Poor Alfred learned this to his cost , that to put small men into great places is to create monsters . When he had realised the bitter truth , he put the stony - hearted paper in his pocket , crept into the yard , and sat down , and , for all he could do , scalding tears ran down his cheeks . “
245421	245425	245179	245180	Noble adversary	6628	” he sobbed ; “
245430	245508	245179	245180	Noble adversary	6628	” Presently he saw Dr. Terry come wandering towards him alone . The Archbold had not deigned to make him safe ; senectitude had done that . Alfred , all heart — sick as he was , went to the old gentleman out of veneration for the outside of his head — which was Shakespearian — and pity for his bodily infirmity ; and offered him an arm . The doctor thanked him sweetly , and said , “
245520	245612	245515	245515	you	8948	” Then Alfred saw that the ancient man had already forgotten his face , and so looking at him with that rare instrument of official inspection , the naked eye , had seen he was sane ; and consequently taken him for a keeper . How swiftly the mind can roam , and from what a distance gather the materials of a thought ! Flashed like lightning through Alfred 's mind this line from one of his pets , the Greek philosophers : και τοντο μεγιστησ εστι τεχνης αγαθα ποιειν τα κακα “
245630	245664	245665	245665	Sir	1075	” Now the feebleness of this aged Inspector was an evil : the thing then was to turn it into a good . Shade of Plato , behold how thy disciple worked thee ! “
245667	245676	245677	245677	I	0	” said he , sinking his voice mysteriously , “
245705	245706	245687	245687	you	1075	” “
245712	245740	245687	245687	you	1075	” replied Nestor , going over beaten tracks ; for he had kept many a queer secret with the loyalty which does his profession so much honour . “
245768	245769	245747	245749	a young gentleman	8552	” “
245776	245777	245770	245770	You	1075	” “
245825	245941	245813	245813	you	1075	” The old fogie said he thought he should , and groped vaguely for his note - book : he extracted it at last like a loose tooth , fumbled with it , and dropped it : Alfred picked it up fuming inwardly . The ancient went to write , but his fingers were weak and hesitating , and by this time he had half forgotten what he was going to say . Alfred 's voice quavered with impatience ; but he fought it down , and offered as coolly as he could to write it for him : the offer was accepted , and he wrote down in a feigned hand , very clear — “
246027	246440	246020	246021	Mr. Abbott	829	” After this stroke of address Alfred took the first opportunity of leaving him , and sent Frank Beverley to him . Thus Alfred , alarmed by the hatred of Mrs. Archbold , and racked with jealousy , exerted all his intelligence and played many cards for liberty . One he kept in reserve ; and a trump card too . Having now no ink nor colouring matter , he did not hesitate , but out penknife , up sleeve , and drew blood from his arm , and with it wrote once more to the Commissioners , but kept this letter hidden for an ingenious purpose . What that purpose was my reader shall divine . WE left Julia Dodd a district visitor . Working in a dense parish she learned the depths of human misery , bodily and mental . She visited an honest widow , so poor that she could not afford a farthing dip , but sat in the dark . When friends came to see her they sometimes brought a candle to talk by . She visited a cripple who often thanked God sincerely for leaving her the use of one thumb . She visited a poor creature who for sixteen years had been afflicted with a tumour in the neck , and had lain all those years on her back with her head in a plate ; the heat of a pillow being intolerable . Julia found her longing to go , and yet content to stay : and praising God in all the lulls of that pain which was her companion day and night . But were I to enumerate the ghastly sights , the stifling loathsome odours , the vulgar horrors upon horrors this refined young lady faced , few of my readers would endure on paper for love of truth what she endured in reality for love of suffering humanity , and of Him whose servant she aspired to be . Probably such sacrifices of selfish ease and comfort are never quite in vain ; they tend in many ways to heal our own wounds : I wo n't say that bodily suffering is worse than mental ; but it is realised far more vividly by a spectator . The grim heart - breaking sights she saw arrayed Julia 's conscience against her own grief ; the more so when she found some of her most afflicted ones resigned , and even grateful . “
246443	246447	246012	246013	Dr. Wycherley	659	” said she , “
246479	246702	246012	246013	Dr. Wycherley	659	” And then , happier than most district visitors , she was not always obliged to look on helpless , or to confine her consolations to good words . Mrs. Dodd was getting on famously in her groove . She was high in the confidence of Cross and Co. , and was inspecting eighty ladies , as well as working ; her salary and profits together were not less than five hundred pounds a year , and her one luxury was charity , and Julia its minister . She carried a good honest basket , and there you might see her Bible wedged in with wine and meat , and tea and sugar : and still , as these melted in her round , a little spark of something warm would sometimes come in her own sick heart . Thus by degrees she was attaining not earthly happiness , but a grave and pensive composure . Yet across it gusts of earthly grief came sweeping often ; but these she hid till she was herself again . To her mother and brother she was kinder , sweeter , and dearer , if possible , than ever . They looked on her as a saint ; but she knew better ; and used to blush with honest shame when they called her so . “
246711	246719	246012	246013	Dr. Wycherley	659	” she would say with unaffected pain . “
246758	246818	246821	246821	her	6653	” Returning one day from her duties very tired , she sat down to take off her bonnet in her own room , and presently heard snatches of an argument that made her prick those wonderful little ears of hers which could almost hear through a wall . The two concluding sentences were a key to the whole dialogue . “
246823	246828	246829	246829	She	6653	” said Mrs. Dodd . “
246853	246854	246840	246840	my	0	” “
246877	246997	247035	247036	a friend	8490	” At this moment Julia came softly into the room with her curiosity hidden under an air of angelic composure . Her mother asked after Mrs. Beecher , to draw her into conversation . She replied quietly that Mrs. Beecher was no better , but very thankful for the wine Mrs. Dodd had sent her . This answer given , she went without any apparent hurry and sat by Edward , and fixed two loving imploring eyes on him in silence . Oh , subtle sex ! This feather was to turn the scale , and make him talk unquestioned . It told . She was close to him too , and mamma at the end of the room . “
247003	247014	247001	247001	Ju	265	” said he , putting his hands in his pockets , “
247042	247048	247035	247036	a friend	8490	” then to Mrs. Dodd : “
247153	247160	247141	247141	I	0	” continued he , getting warm , “
247172	247173	247141	247141	I	0	” “
247181	247185	247175	247175	me	0	” said Julia . “
247196	247197	247141	247141	I	0	” “
247200	247204	247205	247205	I	0	” said Edward . “
247210	247303	247205	247205	I	0	” Julia took the paper , and her eye fell on this short advertisement : Looking at her with some anxiety , they saw the paper give one sharp rustle in her hands , and then quiver a little . She bowed her head over it , and everything seemed to swim . But she never moved : they could neither of them see her face , she defended herself with the paper . The letters cleared again , and , still hiding her face , she studied and studied the advertisement . “
247314	247318	247309	247309	you	0	” said Edward . “
247328	247329	247309	247309	you	0	” “
247336	247382	247309	247309	you	0	” said Mrs. Dodd , with an admirable imitation of cool confidence . Julia said nothing ; but she now rose and put both arms round Edward 's neck , and kissed him fervidly again and again , holding the newspaper tight all the time . “
247385	247390	247309	247309	you	0	” said Mrs. Dodd : “
247397	247398	247393	247393	you	0	” “
247406	247411	247393	247393	you	0	” said Edward cheerfully . “
247436	247437	247434	247434	Ju	265	” “
247467	247573	247463	247463	he	6669	” So saying she kissed the ' Tiser violently more than once ; then fluttered away with it to her own room ashamed to show her joy , and yet not able to hide it . Mrs. Dodd shook her head sorrowfully : and Edward began to look rueful , and doubt whether he had done wisely . I omit the discussion that followed . But the next time his duties permitted him to visit them Mrs. Dodd showed him the ' Tiser in her turn , and with her pretty white taper finger , and such a look , pointed to the following advertisement : “
247578	247583	247574	247576	Poor simple girl	6671	” said Mrs. Dodd , “
247637	247638	247620	247620	she	6673	” “
247644	247648	247620	247620	she	6673	” said Edward ; “
247676	247686	247658	247658	you	0	” Mrs. Dodd took no notice of this remark . “
247694	247698	247691	247691	herself	6673	” she said . “
247708	247722	247691	247691	herself	6673	” And Mrs. Dodd leaned her cheek against Edward 's , and sighed . “
247731	247736	247726	247726	you	1053	” said he sorrowfully . “
247749	247750	247737	247737	I	0	” “
247754	247760	247737	247737	I	0	” cried Mrs. Dodd anxiously ; “
247772	247773	247775	247775	me	0	” “
247780	247781	247782	247782	She	6673	” “
247830	247877	247878	247879	the Wretch	1334	” She then put on maternal authority ( nobody could do it more easily ) and solemnly forbade all violence . He did not venture to contradict her now ; but cherished his resolution all the more , and longed for the hour when he might take “
247880	247933	247934	247935	the Wretch	791	” by the throat , and chastise him , the more publicly the better . Now , the above incident that revealed Julia 's real heart , which she had been hiding more or less all this time from those who could not sympathise with her , took eventually a turn unfavourable to “
247937	248475	247934	247935	the Wretch	791	” So he might well be called . Her great and settled fear had always been that Alfred was dead . Under the immediate influence of his father 's cunning , she had for a moment believed he was false ; but so true and loving a heart could not rest in that opinion . In true love so long as there is one grain of uncertainty , there is a world of faith and credulous ingenuity . So , as Alfred had never been seen since , as nobody could say he was married to another , there was a grain of uncertainty as to his unfaithfulness , and this her true heart magnified to a mountain . But now matters wore another face . She was sure he had written the advertisement . Who but he , out of the few that take the words of any song to heart , admired Aileen Aroon ? Who but he out of the three or four people who might possibly care for that old song , had appearances to explain away ? And who but he knew they took in the Morning Advertiser ? She waited then for the explanation she had invited . She read the advertising column every day over and over . Not a word more . Then her womanly pride was deeply wounded . What , had she courted an explanation where most ladies would have listened to none ; and courted it in vain ! Her high spirit revolted . Her heart swelled against the repeated insults she had received : this last one filled the bitter cup too high . And then her mother came in and assured her he had only inserted that advertisement to keep her in his power . He has heard you are recovering , and are admired by others more worthy of your esteem . Julia cried bitterly at these arguments , for she could no longer combat them . And Mr. Hurd was very attentive and kind . And when he spoke to Julia , and Julia turned away , her eye was sure to meet Mrs. Dodd 's eye imploring her secretly not to discourage the young man too much . And so she was gently pulled by one , and gently thrust by another , away from her first lover and towards his successor . It is an old , old story . Fate seems to exhaust its malice on our first love . For the second the road is smoother . Matters went on so some weeks , and it was perfectly true that Mr. Hurd escorted both ladies one day to Drayton House , at Julia 's request , and not Mrs. Dodd 's . Indeed , the latter lady was secretly hurt at his being allowed to come with them . One Saturday afternoon , Mrs. Dodd went alone to Drayton House by appointment . David was like a lamb , but , as usual , had no knowledge of her . Mrs. Archbold told her a quiet , intelligent , patient had taken a great fancy to him , and she thought this was adding much to his happiness . “
248484	248489	247934	247935	the Wretch	791	” asked Mrs. Dodd . “
248494	248499	247934	247935	the Wretch	791	” said Mrs. Archbold ; “
248506	248516	248500	248500	I	0	” She went out but soon returned , saying , “
248551	248552	248525	248527	the head keeper	11711	” “
248558	248651	248525	248527	the head keeper	11711	” said Mrs. Dodd . Soon after , she kissed Mrs. Archbold , and pressed a valuable brooch upon her : and then took leave . However , at the gate she remembered her parasol . Mrs. Archbold said she would go back for it . Mrs. Dodd would not hear of that : Mrs. Archbold insisted , and settled the question by going . She was no sooner in the house , than young Frank Beverley came running to Mrs. Dodd , and put the missing parasol officiously into her hand . “
248659	248663	248665	248665	you	6689	” said she ; “
248678	249007	248672	248673	Mrs. Archbold	742	” And with this they parted , and the porter opened the gate to her , and she got into her hired cab . She leaned her head back , and , as usual was lost in the sorrowful thoughts of what had been , and what now was . Poor wife , each visit to Drayton House opened her wound afresh . On reaching the stones , there was a turnpike This roused her up ; she took out her purse and paid it . As she drew back to her seat , she saw out of the tail of her feminine eye the edge of something white under her parasol . She took up the parasol , and found a written paper pinned on to it : she detached this paper , and examined it all over with considerable curiosity . It consisted of a long slip about an inch and a quarter broad , rolled like tape , and tied with packthread . She could not see the inside , of course , but she read the superscription : it was firmly but clearly written , in red ink apparently . Of the words I shall only say at present that they were strong and simple , and that their effect on the swift intelligence and tender heart of Mrs. Dodd was overpowering . They knocked at her heart ; they drew from her an audible cry of pity more eloquent than a thousand speeches : and the next moment she felt a little faint ; for she knew now the appeal was not in red ink , but in something very fit to pass between the heart of woe and the heart of pity . She smelt at her salts , and soon recovered that weakness : and next her womanly bosom swelled so with the milk of human kindness that her breath came short . After a little struggle she gushed out aloud , “
249021	249062	248672	248673	Mrs. Archbold	742	” Now , by this time she was close to her own house . She stopped the cab at her door , and asked the driver if his horse was fresh enough to carry her to the Board of Lunacy : “
249070	249074	249068	249068	sir	1075	” said she . “
249081	249086	249075	249075	Lord	6693	” said the cabman , “
249108	249159	249091	249092	my mare	6695	” Reassured on that point Mrs. Dodd went in just to give the servant an order : but as she stood in the passage , she heard her children 's voices and also a friend 's ; the genial , angry tones of Alexander Sampson , M. D. She thought , “
249177	249277	249172	249172	I	0	” and so after a little buzz about dinner and things with Sarah , mounted the stairs , and arrived among them singularly apropos , as it happened . Men like Sampson , who make many foes , do also make stauncher friends than ever the Hare does , and are faithful friends themselves . The boisterous doctor had stuck to the Dodds in all their distresses ; and if they were ever short of money , it certainly was not his fault : for almost his first word , when he found them in a lodging , was , “
249303	249315	249292	249292	I	0	” This being declined politely by Mrs. Dodd , he expostulated . “
249339	249357	249336	249337	a Chick	6698	” He returned to the charge at his next visit and scolded her well for her pride . “
249397	249398	249388	249388	I	0	” “
249407	249412	249388	249388	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd ; “
249440	249549	249553	249553	she	6707	” On the present occasion Dr. Sampson , whose affectionate respect for the leading London physicians has already displayed itself , was inveighing specially against certain specialists , whom , in the rapidity of his lusty eloquence , he called the Mad Ox . He favoured Julia and Edward with a full account of the maniform enormities he had detected them in during thirty years ' practice ; and so descended to his present grievance . A lady , an old friend of his , was being kept in a certain asylum month after month because she had got money and relations , and had once been delirious . “
249570	249607	249563	249563	she	6707	” This lady had thrown a letter over the wall addressed to him ; somebody had posted it : he had asked the Commissioners to let him visit her ; they had declined for the present . “
249619	249656	249563	249563	she	6707	” said he . So now he had bribed the gardener , and made a midnight assignation with the patient ; and was going to it with six stout fellows to carry her off by force . “
249665	249669	249659	249659	my	0	” said he . “
249768	249802	249763	249765	the Mad Ox	729	” At this conjuncture , or soon after , Mrs. Dodd came in with her paper in her hand , a little flurried for once , and after a hasty curtsey , said — “
249842	249908	249950	249950	you	1071	” The writing passed from hand to hand , and left the readers looking very gravely at one another . Julia was quite pale and horror - stricken . All were too deeply moved , and even shocked , to make any commonplace comment ; for it looked and read like a cry from heart to hearts . Dr. Sampson was the first to speak . “
249911	249919	249950	249950	you	1071	” said he , under his breath : “
249938	249939	249950	249950	you	1071	” “
249944	249948	249950	249950	you	1071	” said Edward , “
249960	249961	249950	249950	you	1071	” “
249997	250072	249950	249950	you	1071	” Julia said never a word . Mrs. Dodd , too , was for action not for talk . She bade them all a hasty adieu , and went on her good work . Ere she got to the street door , she heard a swift rustle behind her ; and it was Julia flying down to her , all glowing and sparkling with her old impetuosity , that had seemed dead for ever . “
250077	250086	249950	249950	you	1071	” she cried , panting with generous emotion ; “
250147	250178	250179	250180	the Wretch	791	” Two ladies carried a paper to Whitehall out of charity to a stranger . Therein the elder was a benefactress to a man she had never spoken of but as “
250182	250330	250179	250180	the Wretch	791	” the younger held her truant bridegroom 's heart , I may say , in her hand all the road and was his protectress . Neither recognised the hand - writing ; for no man can write his own hand with a toothpick . They reached Whitehall , and were conducted upstairs to a gentleman of pleasant aspect but powerful brow , seated in a wilderness of letters . He waved his hand , and a clerk set them chairs : he soon after laid down his pen , and leaned gravely forward to hear their business . They saw they must waste no time ; Julia looked at her mother , rose , and took Alfred 's missive to his desk , and handed it him with one of her eloquent looks , grave and pitiful . He seemed struck by her beauty and her manner . “
250348	250353	250179	250180	the Wretch	791	” said Mrs. Dodd . “
250358	250434	250179	250180	the Wretch	791	” said the gentleman , and began to read the superscription with a cold and wary look . But thawed visibly as he read . He opened the missive and ran his eye over it . The perusal moved him not a little : a generous flush mounted to his brow ; he rang the bell sharply . A clerk answered it ; the gentleman wrote on a slip of paper , and said earnestly , “
250453	250487	250179	250180	the Wretch	791	” He then turned to Mrs. Dodd , and put to her a few questions , which drew out the main facts I have just related . The papers were now brought in . “
250493	250502	250179	250180	the Wretch	791	” said he , and ran over them . “
250510	250514	250517	250517	you	6729	” said he , “
250531	250532	250517	250517	you	6729	” “
250544	250550	250551	250551	He	8724	” said Mrs. Dodd piteously . “
250586	250603	250604	250606	the poor gentleman	6734	” Julia looked at her mother , and then asked if it would be wrong to inquire “
250610	250611	250604	250606	the poor gentleman	6734	” “
250614	250619	250604	250606	the poor gentleman	6734	” said the official ; “
250694	251306	251307	251307	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd then gave her address ; and she and Julia went home with a glow about the heart selfish people , thank Heaven , never know . Unconsciously these two had dealt their enemy and Alfred 's a heavy blow ; had set the train to a mine . Their friend at the office was a man of another stamp than Alfred had fallen in with . Meantime Alfred was subjected to hourly mortifications and irritations . He guessed the motive , and tried to baffle it by calm self - possession : but this was far more difficult than heretofore , because his temper was now exacerbated and his fibre irritated by broken sleep ( of this poor David was a great cause ) , and his heart inflamed and poisoned by that cruel , that corroding passion jealousy . To think , that while he was in prison , a rival was ever at his Julia 's ear , making more and more progress in her heart ! This corroder was his bitter companion day and night ; and perhaps of all the maddeners human cunning could have invented this was the worst . It made his temples beat and his blood run boiling poison . Indeed , there were times when he was so distempered by passion that homicide seemed but an act of justice , and suicide a legitimate relief . For who could go on for ever carrying Hell in his bosom up and down a prison yard ? He began to go alone ! to turn impatiently from the petty troubles and fathomless egotism of those afflicted persons he had hitherto forced his sore heart to pity . Pale , thin , and wo - begone , he walked the weary gravel , like the lost ones in that Hall of Eblis whose hearts were a devouring fire . Even an inspector with a naked eye would no longer have distinguished him at first sight from a lunatic of the unhappiest class , the melancholiac . Mrs. Archbold looked on and saw this sad sight , not with the pity it would once have caused , but with a sort of bitter triumph lightened by no pleasure , and darkened by the shadow of coming remorse . Yet up to this time she had shown none of that inconstancy of purpose which marks her sex ; while she did go far to justify the poet 's charge : Rooke had a hint to provoke Alfred to violence such as would justify them in subjecting so popular a patient to bodily restraint , composing draughts , and other quick maddeners . Rooke entered into the game zealously from two motives ; he was devoted to Mrs. Archbold , and he hated Alfred , who had openly defied him , and mortified his vanity about Frank Beverley . One Saturday Alfred was ordered out to walk with Rooke and Hayes and Vulcan . He raised no objection : suspected , felt homicidal , suppressed the impulse , and by this self - command he got time to give that letter to Beverley with instructions . But , all the walk , he was saying to himself that Julia was in the house , and he was kept away from her , and a rival with her ; this made him sicken and rage by turns . He came back in a state verging on fury . On entering the yard poor Beverley , who had done his bit of cunning , and by reaction now relapsed into extra simplicity , came running , and said , “
251317	251318	251312	251312	she	6735	” “
251329	251333	251321	251321	you	0	” cried Rooke . “
251340	251341	251338	251338	Frank	868	” “
251357	251628	251353	251353	ye	0	” cried Rooke , seizing him and throttling him till he was black in the face . Alfred 's long - pent fury broke out : he gnashed his teeth and dashed his fist in Rooke 's face . Rooke staggered back and bellowed with pain and anger , then rushing at him incautiously , received a stinger that staggered him , and nearly closed his right eye . He took the hint , and put himself in a posture that showed he was skilled in the art of self - defence . He stopped two blows neatly , and returned a heavy one upon the ribs . Alfred staggered back some steps , but steadied himself , and , as Rooke rushed in too hastily to improve his advantage , caught him heavily on the other eye , but lost his own balance a little , which enabled Rooke to close ; then came a sharp short rally of re - echoing blows , and Rooke , not to be denied , got hold of his man , and a wrestling bout ensued , in which Alfred being somewhat weakened by misery and broken rest , Rooke 's great weight and strength enabled him , after a severe struggle , to fall with his antagonist under him , and knock the breath out of his body for the moment . Then Hayes , who had stood prudently aloof , came in and helped handcuff him . They could not walk up and down him for the Robin , who stood by with a professional air to see fair play . “
251638	251643	251634	251634	your	6737	” he said satirically . “
251675	251679	251680	251681	A cow	6741	” He added , “
251688	251758	251680	251681	A cow	6741	” When Alfred was handcuffed they turned him loose . It soon transpired , however , that he was now a dangerous maniac ( Formula ) and to be confined in the noisy ward . On hearing this he saw the trap he had fallen into ; saw and trembled . He asked himself what on earth he should do ; and presently the saying came back to him , “
251774	251846	251680	251681	A cow	6741	” He argued thus : Wolf 's love of money is my great evil ; he will destroy me for money , do anything for money . Then suppose I offer him money to be honest . He begged an interview with Dr. Wolf on business . This was accorded at once . He asked the doctor plump whether he received a large sum to detain him under pretence of insanity . “
251860	251866	251857	251858	Mr. Hardie	312	” was the dry reply . “
251915	251922	251900	251900	I	0	” Dr. Wolf 's eyes sparkled . “
251943	251976	251900	251900	I	0	” Dr. Wolf said he should be delighted to do it , if he could conscientiously . At this piece of hypocrisy Alfred 's cheek reddened , and he could not speak . “
251993	251998	251981	251981	I	0	” said Dr. Wolf . “
252023	252033	252034	252034	I	0	” Alfred stared . Had he mistaken his man ? “
252042	252048	252034	252034	I	0	” said the smooth doctor . “
252063	252064	252061	252061	Correggio	895	” “
252069	252077	252065	252065	I	0	” said the quick - witted Alfred ; “
252087	252088	252065	252065	I	0	” “
252104	252105	252095	252095	I	0	” “
252119	252120	252095	252095	I	0	” “
252127	252147	252095	252095	I	0	” And with this understanding the men of business parted . Dr. Wolf consulted Mrs. Archbold then and there . “
252150	252154	252095	252095	I	0	” said she ; “
252171	252172	252187	252187	he	6749	” “
252178	252184	252187	252187	he	6749	” said the poor doctor . “
252194	252199	252187	252187	he	6749	” said Mrs. Archbold . “
252212	252213	252215	252215	you	6743	” “
252244	252245	252233	252233	you	6743	” “
252256	252257	252249	252249	I	0	” “
252273	252311	252312	252312	He	6749	” The doctor promised . Then she owned to him with manifest reluctance that Alfred had taken advantage of her kindness , her indiscretion , in walking alone with him , and made passionate love to her . “
252320	252324	252312	252312	He	6749	” said she , “
252350	252441	252347	252347	his	6749	” Then seeing out of a corner of her eye that the doctor was turning almost green with jealousy , this artist proceeded to describe the love scene between her and Alfred , with feigned hesitation , yet minute detail . Only she inverted the parts : Alfred in her glowing page made the hot love ; she listened abashed , confused , and tried all she could think of to bring him to better sentiments . She concluded this chapter of history inverted with a sigh , and said , “
252454	252455	252444	252444	he	6749	” “
252462	252468	252457	252457	you	0	” asked Dr. Wolf uneasily . “
252506	252781	252782	252782	Cain	896	” And she cast a tender look down at the doctor 's feet . In short , she worked on him so , that he left Alfred at her disposition , and was no sooner gone to his other asylum six miles off ; than the calumniated was conducted by Hayes and Rooke through passage after passage , and door after door , to a wing of the building connected with the main part only by a covered way . As they neared it , strange noises became audible . Faint at first , they got louder and louder . Singing , roaring , howling like wolves . Alfred 's flesh began to creep . He stopped at the covered way : he would have fought to his last gasp sooner than go further , but he was handcuffed . He appealed to the keepers ; but he had used them both too roughly : they snarled and forced him on , and shut him into a common flagged cell , with a filthy truckle - bed in it , and all the vessels of gutta - percha . Here he was surrounded by the desperate order of maniacs he at present scarcely knew but by report . Throughout that awful night he could never close his eyes for the horrible unearthly sounds that assailed him . Singing , swearing , howling like wild beasts ! His right - hand neighbour reasoned high of faith and works , ending each pious argument with a sudden rhapsody of oaths and never slept a wink . His left - hand neighbour alternately sang , and shouted , “
252792	252822	252789	252790	a murderer	6755	” and howled like a wolf , making night hideous . His opposite neighbour had an audience , and every now and then delivered in a high nasal key , “
252829	252835	252836	252836	Brethren	6758	” varying it sometimes thus : “
252844	252975	252836	252836	Brethren	6758	” And then he would deliver a long fervent prayer , and follow it up immediately with a torrent of blasphemies so terrific , that coming in such a contrast they made Alfred 's body wet with perspiration to hear a poor creature so defy his Creator . No rest , no peace . When it was still , the place was like the grave ; and ever and anon , loud , sharp , tremendous , burst a thunderclap of curses , and set those poor demented creatures all yelling again for half - an - hour , making the tombs ring . And at clock - like intervals a harmless but dirty idiot , who was allowed to roam the ward , came and chanted through the keyhole , “
252985	253297	252836	252836	Brethren	6758	” This was the only observation he had made for many years . His ears assailed with horrors , of which you have literally no conception , or shadow of a conception , his nose poisoned with ammoniacal vapours , and the peculiar wild - beast smell that marks the true maniac , Alfred ran wildly about his cell trying to stop his ears , and trembling for his own reason . When the fearful night rolled away , and morning broke , and he could stand on his truckle - bed and see the sweet hoar - frost on a square yard of grass level with his prison bars , it refreshed his very soul , and affected him almost to tears . He was then , to his surprise , taken out , and allowed to have a warm bath and to breakfast with David and the rest ; but I suspect it was done to watch the effect of the trial he had been submitted to . After breakfast , having now no place to go , he lay on a bench , and there exhausted nature overpowered him , and he fell fast asleep . Mrs. Archbold came by on purpose , and saw him . He looked very pale and peaceful . There was a cut on his forehead due to Rooke 's knuckles . Mrs. Archbold looked down , and the young figure and haughty face seemed so unresisting and peaceful sad , she half relented , and shed some bitter tears . That did not , however , prevent her setting her female spies to watch him more closely than ever . He awoke cold but refreshed , and found little Beverley standing by him with wet eyes . Alfred smiled and held out his hand like a captive monarch to his faithful vassal . “
253309	253313	253298	253298	They	6759	” sobbed Frank . “
253321	253322	253325	253325	Frank	868	” “
253333	253341	253344	253344	sir	1075	” roared Rooke from an open window . “
253348	253361	253344	253344	sir	1075	” Alfred 's next visitor was the Robin . He came whispering , “
253398	253399	253402	253402	Heaven	273	” “
253424	253425	253421	253421	I	0	” “
253470	253490	253462	253462	she	6768	” The Robin then sauntered away , affecting nonchalance : and Alfred proceeded to hold the candle as directed . “
253494	253506	253462	253462	she	6768	” said he timidly rising from his seat at her approach . “
253509	253518	253507	253507	Sir	1075	” said she haughtily , and affecting surprise . “
253544	253545	253530	253530	you	8503	” “
253560	253561	253562	253562	I	0	” “
253581	253582	253574	253574	you	1075	” “
253596	253597	253598	253598	I	0	” “
253604	253605	253598	253598	I	0	” “
253611	253615	253606	253606	I	0	” said she . “
253627	253831	253625	253625	Hayes	857	” She whistled , and sent for him ; and gave him the requisite order before Alfred . Alfred thanked her warmly . She smiled , and went away disposed to change her tactics , and , having shown him how she could torment , try soothing means , and open his heart by gratitude . But presently looking out of her window she saw the Robin and him together ; and somehow they seemed to her subtle , observant eyes , to be plotting . The very suspicion was fatal to that officer . His discharge was determined on . Meantime she set her spies to watch him , and tell her if they saw or heard anything . Now Mrs. Archbold was going out to tea that evening , and , as soon as ever this transpired , the keepers secretly invited the keeperesses to a party in the first - class patients drawing - room . This was a rare opportunity , and the Robin and Garrett put their heads together accordingly . In the dusk of the evening the Robin took an opportunity and slipped a new key of the back gate into Alfred 's hand , and told him “
253842	253869	253625	253625	Hayes	857	” he was to get Thompson to go to bed early ; and , instead of taking off his clothes , was to wait in readiness . “
253877	253882	253870	253870	We	6773	” said the Robin , “
253921	253922	253916	253916	you	857	” “
253941	253942	253939	253939	Vulcan	858	” “
254000	254001	253950	253950	him	858	” “
254006	254010	254004	254004	Robin	839	” said Alfred , “
254027	254771	253950	253950	him	858	” The minutes seemed to creep very slowly till eight o'clock came . Then he easily persuaded David to go to bed ; Hayes went up and unlocked the door for them : it closed with a catch - lock . Hayes was drunk , but full of discipline , and insisted on the patients putting out their clothes ; so Alfred made up a bundle from his portmanteau , and threw it out . Hayes eyed it suspiciously , but was afraid to stoop and inspect it closer : for his drunken instinct told him he would pitch on his head that moment : so he retired grumbling and dangling his key . At the end of the corridor he met Mrs. Archbold full dressed , and with a candle in her hand . She held the candle up and inspected him ; and a little conversation followed that sobered Mr. Hayes for a minute or two . Mrs. Archbold was no sooner gone to her little tea - party than all the first - class ladies and gentlemen were sent to bed to get a good sleep for the good of their health , and the keepers and keeperesses took their place and romped , and made such a row , sleep was not easy within hearing of them . They sat on the piano , they sang songs to a drum accompaniment played on the table , they danced , drank , flirted , and enjoyed themselves like schoolboys . Hayes alone was gloomy and morose : so the Robin and Garrett consoled him , drank with him , and soothed him with the balm of insensibility : in which condition they removed him under charitable pretences , and searched his pockets in the passage for the key of Alfred 's room . To their infinite surprise and disappointment it was not upon him . The fact is , Mrs. Archbold had snatched it from him in her wrath , and put it in her own pocket . How far her suspicions went , how much her spies had discovered , I really do n't know ; but somehow or other she was uneasy in her mind , and , seeing Hayes in such a state , she would not trust him during her absence , but took the key away with her . The Robin and Garrett knew nothing of this , and were all abroad , but they thought Rooke must have the key ; so they proceeded to drink with him , and were just about to administer a really effective soporific in his grog , when they and all the merry party were suddenly startled by violent ringing at the bell , and thundering and halloaing at the hall door . The men jumped to their feet and balanced themselves , and looked half wild , half stupid . The women sat , and began to scream : for they had heard a word that has terrors for us all : peculiar terrors for them . This alarm was due to a personage hitherto undervalued in the establishment . Mr. Francis Beverley had been THINKING . So now , finding all the patients boxed up , and their attendants romping in the drawing - room , he lighted seven fires , skilfully on the whole , for practice makes perfect ; but , singular oversight , he omitted one essential ingredient in the fire , and that was the grate . To be plain , Mr. Francis made seven bonfires of bed - curtains , chairs , and other combustibles in the servants ' garrets , lighted them contemporaneously , and retired to the basement , convinced he had taken the surest means to deliver his friend out of Drayton House : and with a certain want of candour that characterises the weak , proceeded to black his other bad master 's shoes with singular assiduity . There was no wind to blow the flame ; but it was a clear frost ; and soon fiery tongues shot out of three garret - windows into the night , and lurid gleams burnished four more , and the old house was burning merrily overhead , and ringing with hilarity on the first floor . But the neighbours saw , pointed , wondered , comprehended , shouted , rang , knocked , and surged round the iron gate . “
254778	254780	253950	253950	him	858	” and “
254783	254824	253950	253950	him	858	” went down the road , and men on horseback galloped for engines ; and the terror - stricken porter opened and the people rushed in and hammered at the hall doors , and when Rooke ran down and opened , “
254827	254844	253950	253950	him	858	” was the word that met him from a score of eager throats and glittering eyes . “
254849	254853	255355	255356	Mr. Hardie	312	” he cried . “
254865	254882	254893	254894	the police	4259	” He ran out and looked up at the tongues of flame and volleys of smoke . “
254887	254891	254893	254894	the police	4259	” he roared . “
254900	255038	254893	254894	the police	4259	” And he dashed back , and calling to the other keepers to unlock all the doors they had keys of , ran up to the garrets to see what could be done . He came out awe - stricken at what he saw . He descended hastily to the third floor . Now the third floor of that wing was occupied principally by servants . In fact , the only patients at that time were Dodd and Alfred . Rooke called to the men below to send Hayes up to No . 75 with his key directly ; he then ran down to the next floor — of which he had keys — and opened all the doors , and said to the inmates with a ghastly attempt at cheerfulness , belied by his shaking voice , “
255054	255062	254893	254894	the police	4259	” He was afraid to utter the word “
255064	255343	254893	254894	the police	4259	” to them . The other keepers were as rapid , each on his beat , and soon the more rational patients took the alarm and were persuaded or driven out half - dressed into the yard , where they cowered together in extremity of fear ; for the fire began to roar overhead like a lion , and lighted up the whole interior red and bright . All was screaming and confusion ; and then came a struggle to get the incurable out from the basement story . There was no time to handcuff them . The keepers trusted to the terror of the scene to cow them , and so opened the doors and got them out anyhow . Wild , weird forms , with glaring eyes and matted hair , leaped out and ran into the hall , and laughed , and danced , and cursed in the lurid reflection of the fires above . Hell seemed discharging demons . Men recoiled from them . And well they did ; for now the skylight exploded , and the pieces fell tinkling on the marble hall fast as hail . The crowd recoiled and ran ; but those awful figures continued their gambols . One picked up the burning glass and ground it in his hands that bled directly : but he felt neither burn nor cut . The keepers rushed in to withdraw them from so dangerous a place : all but one obeyed with sudden tameness : that one struggled and yelled like a demon . In the midst of which fearful contest came a sudden thundering at a door on the third floor . “
255348	255352	254893	254894	the police	4259	” cried Rooke . “
255358	255363	255364	255364	You	312	” screamed the Robin . “
255371	255372	255364	255364	You	312	” “
255383	255384	255373	255373	I	0	” “
255398	255399	255393	255393	You	312	” “
255412	255413	255404	255404	I	0	” “
255462	255463	255458	255458	Rooke	856	” “
255475	255945	255469	255469	Hayes	857	” cried Rooke , stamping on the ground , and white with terror . By this time Garrett had got a hammer , and he and Wales rushed wildly up the stairs to batter in the strong door if they could . They got to the third floor , but with difficulty ; the smoke began to blind them and choke them , and fiery showers fell on them , and drove them back smarting and choking . Garrett sank down gasping at the stair - foot . Wales ran into the yard uttering pitiful cries , and pointing wildly upwards ; but before he got there , a hand had broken through the glass of a window up in the third floor , the poor white hand of a perishing prisoner , and clutched the framework and tore at it . At this hand a thousand white faces were now upturned amid groans of pity and terror , such as only multitudes can utter . Suddenly those anxious faces and glistening eyes turned like one , for an attempt , wild and unintelligible , but still an attempt , was about to be made to save that hand and its owner out of the very jaws of death . Now amongst the spectators was one whose life and reason were at stake on that attempt . Mrs. Dodd was hurrying homeward from this very neighbourhood when the fire broke out . Her son Edward was coming at nine o'clock to tea , and , better still , to sleep . He was leaving the fire brigade . It had disappointed him ; he found the fire - escape men saved the lives , the firemen only the property . He had gone into the business earnestly too ; he had invented a thing like a treble pouch hook , which could be fastened in a moment to the end of a rope , and thrown into the window , and would cling to the bare wall , if there was nothing better , and enable him to go up and bring life down . But he had never got a chance to try it ; and , per contra , he was on the engine when they went tearing over a woman and broke her arm and collar - bone in the Blackfriars Road ; and also when they went tearing over their own fire - dog , and crippled him . All this seemed out of character , and shocked Edward ; and then his mother could not get over the jacket . In a quarter of an hour he was to take off the obnoxious jacket for ever , and was now lounging at the station smoking a short pipe , when a man galloped up crying “
255948	255949	255469	255469	Hayes	857	” “
255953	255961	255469	255469	Hayes	857	” said Edward , giving a whiff . “
255964	255965	255458	255458	Rooke	856	” “
255972	255997	255458	255458	Rooke	856	” Guess how long before the horses were to , and the engine tearing at a gallop down the road , and the firemen shouting “
256002	256034	255460	255460	Rooke	856	” to clear the way , and Edward 's voice the loudest . When the report of fire swept townward past Mrs. Dodd , she turned , and saw the glow . “
256038	256042	255460	255460	Rooke	856	” said she , “
256051	256587	255460	255460	Rooke	856	” And full of the tender fears that fill such bosoms as hers for those they love , she could not go home till she had ascertained that it was not Drayton House . Moreover , Edward 's was the nearest station ; she had little hope now of seeing him to tea . She sighed , and retraced her steps , and made timid inquiries , but could gain no clear information . Presently she heard galloping behind her , and the fireman 's wild sharp cry of fire . An engine drawn by two powerful brown horses came furiously , all on fire itself with red paint and polished steel gleaming in the lights ; helmeted men clustered on it , and out of one of these helmets looked a face like a fighting lion 's , the eyes so dilated , the countenance in such towering excitement , the figure half rising from his seat as though galloping was too slow and he wanted to fly . It was Edward . Mother and son caught sight of one another as the engine thundered by , and he gave her a solemn ardent look , and pointed towards the fire ; by that burning look and eloquent gesture she knew it was something more than a common fire . She trembled and could not move . But this temporary weakness was followed by an influx of wild vigour ; she forgot her forty - two years , and flew to hover round the fire as the hen round water . Unfortunately she was too late to get any nearer than the road outside the gates , the crowd was so dense . And , while her pale face and anxious eyes , the eyes of a wife and a mother , were bent on that awful fire , the human tide flowed swiftly up behind her , and there she was wedged in . She was allowed her foot of ground to stand and look like the rest — no more . Mere unit in that mass of panting humanity , hers was one of the thousands of upturned faces lurid in the light of the now blazing roof . She saw with thousands the hand break the window and clutch the frame ; she gasped with the crowd at that terrible and piteous sight , and her bosom panted for her fellow - creature in sore peril . But what is this ? The mob inside utter a great roar of hope ; the crowd outside strain every eye . A gleaming helmet overtops the outer wall . It is a fireman mounting the great elm - tree in the madhouse yard . The crowd inside burst in a cheer . He had a rope round his loins ; his face was to the tree . He mounted and mounted like a cat ; higher , and higher , and higher , till he reached a branch about twelve feet above the window and as many distant from it laterally ; the crowd cheered him lustily . But Mrs. Dodd , half distracted with terror , implored them not to encourage him . “
256593	256598	256599	256602	my poor reckless darling	6790	” she cried despairingly ; “
256619	256620	256621	256622	Dear heart	9976	” “
256624	256629	256632	256633	the lady	1031	” said a woman , “
256640	256641	256637	256638	Poor thing	10951	” “
256649	256656	256647	256647	ma'am	8773	” said a coal - heaver . “
256688	257225	256681	256682	Good people	10306	” And she covered her face , and prayed and trembled and sobbed hysterically . A few yards behind was another woman , who had arrived later , yet like her was wedged immovable . This woman was more terror - stricken than Mrs. Dodd ; and well she might ; for she knew who was behind that fatal window : the woman 's name was Edith Archbold . The flames were now leaping through the roof , and surging up towards heaven in waves of fire six feet high . Edward , scorched and half blinded , managed to fasten his rope to the bough , and , calculating the distances vertical and lateral he had to deal with , took up rope accordingly , and launched himself into the air . The crowd drew their breath so hard it sounded like a murmur . To their horror he missed the window , and went swinging back . There was a cry of dismay . But Edward had never hoped to leap into the window ; he went swinging by the rope back to the main stem of the tree , gave it a fierce spang with his feet , and by this means and a powerful gesture of his herculean loins got an inch nearer the window : back again , and then the same game ; and so he went swinging to and fro over a wider and wider space ; and , by letting out an inch of cord each swing , his flying feet came above the window - ledge , then a little higher , then higher still ; and now , oh sight strange and glorious — as this helmeted hero , with lips clenched and great eyes that stared unflinchingly at the surging flames , and gleamed supernaturally with inward and outward fire , swang to and fro on his frail support still making for the window — the heads of all the hoping , fearing , admiring , panting crowd went surging and waving to and fro beneath ; so did not their hearts only but their agitated bodies follow the course of his body , as it rushed to and fro faster and faster through the hot air starred with snow - flakes , and hail , of fire . And those his fellow - men for whom the brave fireman made this supernatural effort , did they know their desperate condition ? Were they still alive ? One little hour ago Alfred sat on the bed , full of hope . Every minute he expected to hear the Robin put a key into the door . He was all ready , and his money in his pocket . Alas ! his liberator came not ; some screw loose again . Presently he was conscious of a great commotion in the house . Feet ran up and down . Then came a smell of burning . The elm - tree outside was illuminated . He was glad at first ; he had a spite against the place . But soon he became alarmed , and hammered at the door and tried to force it . Impossible . “
257228	257365	256681	256682	Good people	10306	” rang from men 's voices . Fire crackled above his head ; he ran about the room like a wild creature ; he sprang up at the window and dashed his hand through , but fell back . He sprang again and got his hand on some of the lighter woodwork ; he drew himself up nearly to the window , and then the wood gave way and he fell to the ground , and striking the back of his head , nearly stunned himself ; the flames roared fearfully now ; and at this David , who had hitherto sat unconcerned , started up , and in a stentorian voice issued order upon order to furl every rag of sail and bring the ship to the wind . He thought it was a tempest . “
257371	257695	256681	256682	Good people	10306	” cried Alfred in vain .. A beam fell from the roof to the floor , precursor of the rest . On this David thought the ship was ashore , and shouted a fresh set of orders proper to the occasion , so terribly alike are the angry voices of the sister - elements . But Alfred implored him , and got him to kneel down with him , and held his hand , and prayed . And , even while they kneeled and Alfred prayed , Death and Life met and fought for them . Under the door , tight as it was , and through the keyhole , struggled a hot stifling smoke , merciful destroyer running before fire ; and the shadow of a gigantic figure began to flicker in from the outside , and to come and go upon the wall . Alfred did not know what that was , but it gave him a vague hope : he prayed aloud as men pray only for their bodies . ( The crowd heard him and hushed itself breathless . ) The smoke penetrated faster , blinding and stifling ; the giant shadow came and went . But now the greater part of the roof fell in with an awful report ; the blazing timbers thundered down to the basement with endless clatter of red - hot tiles ; the walls quivered , and the building belched skyward a thousand jets of fire like a bouquet of rockets : and then a cloud of smoke . Alfred gave up all hope , and prepared to die . Crash ! as if discharged from a cannon , came bursting through the window , with the roar of an applauding multitude and a mother 's unheeded scream , a helmeted figure , rope in hand , and alighted erect and commanding on the floor amidst a shower of splinters and tinkling glass . “
257704	257746	257747	257748	the Wretch	1334	” roared this fire - warrior , clutching them hard , and dragged them both up to their feet by one prodigious gesture : all three faces came together and shone in the lurid light ; and he knew his father and “
257750	257752	257747	257748	the Wretch	1334	” and “
257755	257759	257753	257755	the Wretch ”	13367	” knew him . “
257762	257763	257753	257755	the Wretch ”	13367	” “
257766	257854	257753	257755	the Wretch ”	13367	” passed like pistol shots ; but not a word : even this strange meeting went for little , so awful was the moment , so great are Death and Fire . Edward clawed his rope to the bed ; up to the window by it , dropped his line to fireman Jackson planted express below , and in another moment was hauling up a rope ladder : this he attached , and getting on it and holding his own rope by way of banister , cried , “
257865	258179	258180	258180	Gently	627	” But poor David called that deserting the ship , and demurred , till Alfred assured him the captain had ordered it . He then submitted directly , touched his forelock to Edward , whom he took for that officer , and went down the ladder ; Alfred followed . Now the moment those two figures emerged from the burning pile , Mrs. Dodd , already half dead with terror for her son , saw and knew her husband : for all about him it was as light as day . What terror ! what joy ! what gratitude ! what pride ! what a tempest of emotions ! But her fears were not ended : Edward , not to overweight the ladder , went dangling by his hands along the rope towards the tree . And his mother 's eyes stared fearfully from him to the other , and her heart hung trembling on her husband descending cautiously , and then on his preserver , her son , who was dangling along by the hands on that frail support . The mob cheered him royally , but she screamed and hid her face again . At last both her darlings were safe , and then the lusty cheers made her thrill with pride and joy , till all of a sudden they seemed to die away , and the terrible fire to go out ; and the sore - tried wife and mother drooped her head and swooned away , wedged in and kept from falling by the crowd . Inside , the mob parted and made two rushes , one at the rescued men , one at the gallant fireman . Alfred and David were overpowered with curiosity and sympathy . They had to shake a hundred honest hands , and others still pressing on hurried them nearly off their feet . “
258190	258194	258195	258195	He	6804	” said Alfred . “
258200	258207	258197	258198	the keeper	11809	” said one of the crowd . “
258242	258243	258232	258233	good friends	3842	” “
258247	258313	258232	258233	good friends	3842	” was the cry , and they rushed with him to the back door . Rooke , who was about twenty yards off saw and suspected this movement . He fought his way and struggled after Alfred in silence . Presently , to his surprise , Alfred unlocked the door and whipped out with David , leaving the door open . Rooke shouted and halloaed : “
258321	258415	258317	258317	he	6804	” and struggled madly to the door . Now another crowd had been waiting in the meadows ; seeing the door open they rushed in and the doorway was jammed directly . In the confusion Alfred drew David along the side of the wall ; told him to stay quiet , bolted behind an outhouse , and then ran across country for the bare life . To his horror David followed him , and with a madman 's agility soon caught him . He snorted like a spirited horse , and shouted cheerily , “
258426	258427	258421	258421	I	0	” “
258433	258738	258421	258421	I	0	” cried Alfred , half mad himself with excitement , and the pair ran furiously , and dashed through hedges and ditches , torn , bleeding , splashed , triumphant ; behind them the burning madhouse , above them the spangled sky , the fresh free air of liberty blowing in their nostrils , and rushing past their ears . Alfred 's chest expanded , he laughed for joy , he sang for joy , he leaped as he went ; nor did he care where he went . David took the command , and kept snuffing the air , and shaping his course for blue water . And so they rushed along the livelong night . Free . A REPORT came round that the asylum was open in the rear . A rush was made thither from the front : and this thinned the crowd considerably ; so then Mrs. Dodd was got out by the help of some humane persons , and carried into the nearest house , more dead than alive . There she found Mrs. Archbold in a pitiable state . That lady had been looking on the fire , with the key in her pocket , by taking which she was like to be a murderess : her terror and remorse were distracting , and the revulsion had thrown her into violent hysterics . Mrs. Dodd plucked up a little strength , and characteristically enough tottered to her assistance , and called for the best remedies , and then took her hand and pressed it , and whispered soothingly that both were now safe , meaning David and Edward . Mrs. Archbold thought she meant Alfred and David : this new shock was as good for her as cold water : she became quieter , and presently gulped out , “
258754	258755	258743	258743	You	6809	” “
258759	258764	258757	258757	them	6810	” said Mrs. Dodd ; “
258777	258786	258766	258766	one	8375	” Mrs. Archbold gave a sigh of relief . “
258791	258796	258789	258789	madam	8503	” continued Mrs. Dodd , “
258831	258895	258827	258829	a proud mother	6822	” She could say no more for tears of joy , and while she wept deliciously , Mrs. Archbold cried too , and so invigorated and refreshed her cunning , and presently she perked up and told Mrs. Dodd boldly that Edward had been seeking her , and was gone home ; she had better follow him , or he would be anxious . “
258901	258906	258827	258829	a proud mother	6822	” objected Mrs. Dodd . “
258911	258916	258827	258829	a proud mother	6822	” said the other ; “
258927	258928	258917	258917	I	0	” “
258931	258939	258950	258950	he	11671	” said Mrs. Dodd , with meaning , “
258952	258953	258950	258950	he	11671	” “
258956	259033	258950	258950	he	11671	” ( Ump . ) She then promised to take David under her especial care , and Mrs. Dodd consented , though reluctantly , to go home . To her surprise Edward had not yet arrived , and Julia was sitting up , very anxious ; and flew at her with a gurgle , and kissed her eagerly , and then , drawing back her head , searched the maternal eyes for what was the matter . “
259041	259046	259036	259036	you	9193	” said Mrs. Dodd . “
259059	259108	259109	259111	dear mammas ”	13410	” and she sank into a chair , and held up her arms . Julia settled down in them directly , and in that position Mrs. Dodd told all the night 's work , told it under a running accompaniment of sighs and kisses , and ejaculations , and “
259111	259113	259114	259115	poor mammas	6828	” and “
259117	259212	259114	259115	poor mammas	6828	” and bursts of sympathy , astonishment , pity and wonder . Thus embellished and interrupted , the strange tale was hardly ended , when a manly step came up the stairs , and both ladies pinched each other , and were still as mice , and in walked a fireman with a wet livery , and a face smirched with smoke . Julia flew at him with a gurgle of the first degree , and threw her arms round his neck , and kissed both his blackened cheeks again and again , crying , “
259252	259372	259240	259242	a Christian hero	6832	” Mrs. Dodd checked her impetuous career by asking piteously if his mother was not to have him . On this , Julia drew him along by the hand , and sank with him at Mrs. Dodd 's knees , and she held him at arm 's length and gazed at him , and then drew him close and enfolded him , and thanked God for him ; and then they both embraced him at once , and interwove him Heaven knows how , and poured the wealth of their womanly hearts out on him in a torrent , and nearly made him snivel . But presently something in his face struck Mrs. Dodd accustomed to read her children . “
259381	259392	259379	259379	love	1402	” she inquired anxiously . He looked down and said , “
259404	259405	259408	259408	he	0	” “
259414	259422	259408	259408	he	0	” said Julia , doing the submaternal ; “
259431	259443	259425	259425	I	0	” and she flew off , turned suddenly at the door with “
259449	259478	259425	259425	I	0	” and up to his bedroom and put more coals on his fire , and took a swift housewifely look all round . Mrs. Dodd seized the opportunity . “
259486	259487	259479	259479	Edward	554	” “
259492	259497	259479	259479	Edward	554	” said he drily . “
259512	259513	259507	259507	you	1053	” “
259535	259607	259523	259523	I	0	” Soon after this they all bade each other good night ; and presently Mrs. Dodd came and tapped softly at her son 's door , and found him with his vest and coat off , and his helmet standing on the table reflecting a red coal ; he was seated by the fire in a brown study , smoking . He apologised , and offered to throw the weed away . “
259612	259620	259523	259523	I	0	” said she , suppressing a cough , “
259628	259629	259523	259523	I	0	” “
259657	259658	259650	259650	I	0	” “
259662	259674	259675	259675	Mamma	1053	” sighed Mrs. Dodd resignedly , and waited patiently all ears . “
259677	259694	259675	259675	Mamma	1053	” said the fire - warrior , becoming speculative under the dreamy influence of the weed , “
259851	259862	259847	259848	The Wretch	1334	” Mrs. Dodd held up her hands in mute amazement . “
259895	259905	259910	259910	he	554	” ( Puff . ) Mrs. Dodd groaned aloud . “
259912	259917	259910	259910	he	554	” she said faintly . “
259937	259938	259927	259928	Mrs. Archbold	742	” “
259973	260007	259967	259967	Our	6859	” He smoked on in profound silence waiting for her to speak . But she lay back in her chair mute and all relaxed , as if the news had knocked her down . “
260012	260018	259967	259967	Our	6859	” said Edward at last ; “
260035	260036	260053	260053	you	0	” “
260042	260051	260053	260053	you	0	” said Mrs. Dodd , shocked into energy . “
260066	260108	260053	260053	you	0	” She then assured him that , if Alfred 's sad state came to Julia 's ears , all her love for him would revive , and she would break with Mr. Hurd , and indeed never marry all her life . “
260117	260127	260109	260109	I	0	” continued Mrs. Dodd , with a deep sigh ; “
260230	260240	260227	260227	I	0	” The mother could utter no more for emotion . “
260243	260247	260248	260248	you	6869	” said Edward , “
260282	260287	260288	260288	Edward	554	” ( Puff . ) “
260290	260299	260288	260288	Edward	554	” said Mrs. Dodd , after some consideration , “
260326	260327	260329	260329	he	723	” “
260339	260340	260336	260336	she	1441	” “
260419	260420	260404	260404	she	1441	” “
260429	260430	260404	260404	she	1441	” “
260481	260482	260488	260489	mammy dear	6875	” “
260491	260495	260485	260485	you	1053	” said Edward . “
260510	260526	260498	260498	I	0	” And the fire - warrior sucked at his cigar , to stop a sigh . “
260541	260545	260498	260498	I	0	” sighed Mrs. Dodd “
260557	260558	260547	260547	you	0	” “
260615	260753	260598	260598	I	0	” At breakfast time came a messenger with a line from Mrs. Archbold , to say that David had escaped from Drayton House , in company with another dangerous maniac . Mrs. Dodd received the blow with a kind of desperate resignation . She rose quietly from the table without a word , and went to put on her bonnet , leaving her breakfast and the note ; for she did not at once see all that was implied in the communication . She took Edward with her to Drayton House . The firemen had saved one half of that building ; the rest was a black shell . Mrs. Archbold came to them , looking haggard , and told them two keepers were already scouring the country , and an advertisement sent to all the journals . “
260758	260763	260598	260598	I	0	” said Mrs. Dodd , “
260779	260854	260598	260598	I	0	” Mrs. Archbold said she might dismiss this fear ; the patient in question had but one illusion , and , though terribly dangerous when thwarted in that , was most intelligent in a general way , and much attached to Mr. Dodd ; they were always together . A strange expression shot into Mrs. Dodd 's eye : she pinched Edward 's arm to keep him quiet , and said with feigned indifference — “
260871	260872	260858	260869	the one who was in such danger with my husband last night	6883	” “
260875	260919	260858	260869	the one who was in such danger with my husband last night	6883	” said Mrs. Archbold off her guard . It had not occurred to her that this handsome , fashionably - dressed young gentleman , was the fireman of last night . She saw her mistake , though , the moment he said bluntly , “
260931	260932	260922	260922	you	0	” “
260938	260946	260934	260934	I	0	” asked Mrs. Archbold , mighty innocently : “
260961	261138	260955	260955	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd was silent a moment , then , somewhat hastily bade Mrs. Archbold good - bye . She told the cabman to drive to an old acquaintance of ours , Mr. Green . He had set up detective on his own account . He was not at his office , but expected . She sat patiently down till he came in . They put their heads together , and Green dashed down to the asylum with a myrmidon , while Mrs. Dodd went into the City to obtain leave of absence from Cross and Co. This was politely declined at first , but on Mrs. Dodd showing symptoms of leaving them altogether , it was conceded . She returned home with Edward , and there was Mr. Green : he had actually traced the fugitives by broken fences , and occasional footsteps in the side clay of ditches , so far as to leave no doubt they had got upon the great south - eastern road . Then Mrs. Dodd had a female inspiration . “
261153	261154	261155	261155	I	0	” “
261164	261168	261161	261162	a sailor	1097	” said Green . “
261197	261224	261225	261225	I	0	” Mrs. Dodd almost started at this off - hand question . But it was a natural one for Green to ask . She said gravely , “
261232	261247	261225	261225	I	0	” Green 's eye sparkled , and he took out his note - book . “
261257	261289	261251	261251	he	1462	” Mrs. Dodd seemed to wince at the question , and then turned her eyes inward to divine . The result was she gave a downright shudder , and said evasively , “
261305	261306	261294	261294	I	0	” “
261311	261315	261294	261294	I	0	” said Green , “
261377	261407	261442	261442	ma'am	8773	” Mrs. Dodd thus pressed , turned her eyes more and more inward , and said at last in a very low voice , and with a sort of concentrated horror—“He
261414	261439	261442	261442	ma'am	8773	” Mr. Green booked this eagerly . The lady 's emotion was nothing to him ; the hint was invaluable , the combination interesting . “
261444	261448	261442	261442	ma'am	8773	” said he , “
261504	261505	261495	261496	Tom Green	776	” “
261515	261516	261506	261506	I	0	” “
261541	261604	261605	261606	the Wretch	1334	” Mrs. Dodd waived this objection almost contemptuously ; she was all wife now . It was agreed that Green should drive round for her in an hour . He departed for the present , and Edward proposed to go in the dog - cart too , but she told him no ; she wanted him at home to guard his sister against “
261608	261615	261605	261606	the Wretch	1334	” Then seeing him look puzzled , “
261620	261624	261618	261618	Edward	254	” said she , “
261685	261693	261678	261679	The Wretch	791	” Edward from puzzled looked very grave . “
261703	261707	261678	261679	The Wretch	791	” he said . “
261728	261729	261724	261724	you	254	” “
261835	261836	261794	261796	that furious wretch	6918	” “
261847	261978	261839	261839	I	0	” said Edward . And he comforted her a little by promising faithfully not to let Julia go out of his sight till her return . She put on a plain travelling - dress . The dog - cart came . She slipped fifty sovereigns into Mr. Green 's hands for expenses , and off they went at a slapping pace . The horse was a great bony hunter of rare speed and endurance , and his long stride and powerful action raised poor Mrs. Dodd 's hopes , and the rushing air did her good . Green , to her surprise , made few inquiries for some miles on the Dover road ; but he explained to her that the parties they were after had probably walked all night . “
261987	262052	261979	261979	They	6921	” said Mr. Green . At Dartford they got a doubtful intimation , on the strength of which he rattled on to Rochester . There he pulled up , deposited Mrs. Dodd at the principal inn till morning , and scoured the town for intelligence . He inquired of all the policemen ; described his men , and shrewdly added out of his intelligence , “
262058	262113	261979	261979	They	6921	” No , the Bobbies had not seen them . Then he walked out to the side of the town nearest London , and examined all the dealers in food . At last he found a baker who , early that morning , had sold a quartern loaf to two tall men without hats , “
262118	262122	261979	261979	They	6921	” he added , “
262145	262209	262137	262137	they	6922	” On hearing they had entered Rochester hatless , the shrewd Mr. Green made direct to the very nearest slop - shop ; and his sagacity was rewarded : the shopkeeper was a chatterbox , and told him yes , two gents out on a frolic had bought a couple of hats of him , and a whole set of sailor 's clothes . “
262245	262364	262237	262237	I	0	” At that Green offered a sovereign for the old clothes blindfold . The trader instantly asked two pounds , and took thirty shillings . Green now set the police to scour the town for a gentleman and a common sailor in company , offered a handsome reward , and went to bed in a small inn , with David 's clothes by the kitchen fire . Early in the morning he went to Mrs. Dodd 's hotel with David 's clothes , nicely dried , and told her his tale . She knew the clothes directly , kissed them , and cried over them : then gave him her hand with a world of dignity and grace : “
262379	262380	262370	262370	Sir	1075	” “
262389	262395	262382	262382	you	1075	” said the delighted Green . “
262472	262757	262758	262758	I	0	” The dog - cart took the road , and the ex - hunter stepped out thirteen miles an hour . Now at this moment Alfred and David were bowling along ahead with a perfect sense of security . All that first night , the grandest of his life , Alfred walked on air , and drank the glorious exhilarating breath of Freedom . But , when the sun dawned on them , his intoxicating joy began to be dashed with apprehension : hatless and bemired , might they not be suspected and detained by some officious authority ? But the slop - shop set that all right . He took a double - bedded room in The Bear , locked the door , put the key under his pillow , and slept till eleven . At noon they were on the road again , and as they swung lustily along in the frosty but kindly air , Alfred 's chest expanded , his spirits rose , and he felt a man all over . Exhilarated by freedom , youth , and motion , and a little inflated by reviving vanity , his heart , buoyant as his foot , now began to nurse aspiring projects : he would indict his own father , and the doctors , and immolate them on the altar of justice and publicly wipe off the stigma they had cast on him , and meantime he would cure David and restore him to his family . He loved this harmless companion of his cell , his danger , and his flight ; loved him for Julia 's sake , loved him for his own . Youth and vanity whispered , “
262773	262969	262767	262767	I	0	” It struck him David 's longing for blue water was one of those unerring instincts that sometimes guide the sick to their cure . And then as the law permits the forcible recapture of a patient — without a fresh order or certificates — within fourteen days of his escape from an asylum , he did not think it prudent to show himself in London till that time should have elapsed . So , all things considered , why not hide a few days with David in some insignificant seaport , and revel in liberty and blue water with him all day long , and so by associations touch the spring of memory , and begin the cure ? As for David , he seemed driven seaward by some unseen spur ; he fidgeted at all delay ; even dinner fretted him ; he panted so for his natural element . Alfred humoured him , and an hour after sunset they reached the town of Canterbury . Here Alfred took the same precautions as before , and slept till nine o'clock . When he awoke , he found David walking to and fro impatiently . “
262975	262979	262767	262767	I	0	” said Alfred , “
262988	263119	262767	262767	I	0	” He made all haste , and they were on the road again by ten , walking at a gallant pace . But the dog - cart was already rattling along about thirty miles behind them . Green inquired at all the turnpikes and vehicles ; the scent was cold at first , but warmer by degrees , and hot at Canterbury . Green just baited his gallant horse , and came foaming on , and just as the pair entered the town of Folkestone , their pursuers came up to the cross - roads , not five miles behind them . Alfred went to a good inn in Folkestone and ordered a steak , then strolled with David by the beach , and gloried in the water with him . “
263133	263137	263170	263170	messmate	6808	” said he . “
263151	263165	263170	263170	messmate	6808	” David snuffed the breeze and his eye sparkled , and he said , “
263172	263230	263170	263170	messmate	6808	” And this remark , slight as it was was practical , and gave Alfred great delight : strengthened his growing conviction that not for nothing had this charge been thrown on him . He should be the one to cure his own father ; for Julia 's father was his : he had no father now . “
263234	263239	263170	263170	messmate	6808	” said he gaily , “
263264	263335	263256	263257	old boy	4624	” David said nothing and went rather doggedly back to the inn with him . The steak was on the table . Alfred told the waiter to uncover and David to fall to , while he just ran upstairs to wash his hands . He came down in less than two minutes ; but David was gone , and the waiter standing there erect and apathetic like a wooden sentinel . “
263342	263346	263347	263347	Gent	901	” said Alfred . “
263352	263357	263359	263359	you	6949	” was the reply . “
263376	263377	263378	263378	I	0	” “
263383	263389	263378	263378	I	0	” said the waiter angrily , “
263409	263601	263378	263378	I	0	” Alfred darted out and scoured the town ; he asked everybody if they had seen a tall gentleman dressed like a common sailor . Nobody could tell him : there were so many sailors about the port ; that which in an inland town would have betrayed the truant concealed him here . A cold perspiration began to gather on Alfred 's brow , as he ran wildly all over the place . He could not find him , nor any trace of him . At last it struck him that he had originally proposed to go to Dover , and had spoken of that town to David , though he had now glanced aside , making for the smaller ports on the south coast : he hired a horse directly , and galloped furiously to Dover . He rode down to the pier , gave his horse to a boy to hold , and ran about inquiring far David . He could not find him : but at last he found a policeman , who told him he thought there was another party on the same lay as himself : “
263604	263611	263378	263378	I	0	” said the man correcting himself , “
263631	263644	263626	263626	you	6957	” Alfred 's blood ran cold . Pursued ! and so hotly : “
263649	263653	263626	263626	you	6957	” he stammered ; “
263663	263678	263656	263656	I	0	” Then he said cunningly ( for asylums teach the frankest natures cunning ) , “
263693	263886	263656	263656	I	0	” Bobby consented , and under its influence described Mrs. Dodd and her companions to him . But not everybody can describe minutely . In the bare outlines , which were all this artist could furnish him , Alfred recognised at once , whom do you think ? Mrs. Archbold , Dr. Wolf , and his arch enemy Rooke , the keeper . Doubtless his own mind , seizing on so vague a description , adapted it rather hastily to what seemed probable . Mrs. Dodd never occurred to him , nor that David was the sole , or even the main object of the pursuit . He was thoroughly puzzled what to do . However , as his pursuers had clearly scoured Dover , and would have found David if there , he made use of their labours and galloped back towards Folkestone . But he took the precaution to inquire at the first turnpike , and there he learned a lady and two men had passed through about an hour before in a dog - cart ; it was a wonder he had missed them . Alfred gnashed his teeth ; “
263890	263894	263888	263888	you	6959	” he muttered . “
263913	264147	263656	263656	I	0	” He turned his horse 's head westward and rode after David . Convinced that his lost friend would not go inland , he took care to keep near the cliffs , and had ever an eye on the beach when the road came near enough . About eight miles west of Folkestone he saw a dog - cart going down a hill before him : but there was only a single person in it . However , he increased his pace and got close behind it as it mounted the succeeding hill which was a high one . Walking leisurely behind it his quick eye caught sight of a lady 's veil wrapped round the iron of the seat . That made him instantly suspect this might be the dog - cart after all . But , if so , how came a stranger in it ? He despised a single foe , and resolved to pump this one and learn where the others were . While he was thinking how he should begin , the dog - cart stopped at the top of the hill , and the driver looked seaward at some object that appeared to interest him . It was a glorious scene . Viewed from so great a height the sea expanded like ocean , and its light - blue waters sparkled and laughed innumerable in the breeze . “
264154	264160	264405	264405	he	6964	” said the escaped prisoner , “
264170	264179	264180	264180	I	0	” The man touched his hat and chuckled . “
264194	264199	264192	264192	sir	1075	” he said politely . “
264218	264286	264200	264200	I	0	“ No , sir ; not but what I can enjoy that a bit , too : but what I 'm looking at is an ' unt . Do you see that little boat ? Sailing right down the coast about eight miles off . Well , sir , what do you think there is in that boat ? But you 'll never guess . A madman . ”
264287	264290	264407	264407	his	6964	“ Ah ! ”
264291	264403	264407	264407	his	6964	“ Curious , sir , is n't it : a respectable gentleman too he is , and sails well ; only stark staring mad . There was two of 'em in company : but it seems they ca n't keep together long . Our one steals a fisherman 's boat , and there he goes down channel . And now look here , sir ; see this steam - tug smoking along right in front of us : she 's after him , and see there 's my governor aboard standing by the wheel with a Bobby and a lady : and if ever there was a lady she 's one ; ”
264410	264428	264405	264405	he	6964	“ She 's that mad gentleman 's wife , sir , as I am a living sinner . ”
264440	264446	264453	264453	his	312	“ Will they catch her ? ”
264456	264482	264453	264453	his	312	“ How can we be off it ? steam against sails . And if he runs ashore , I shall be there to nab him . ”
264496	264508	264509	264509	he	312	“ It 's the best thing that can befall him now , ”
264878	264948	264951	264951	he	902	“ And as for your invention , it has been invented four times before you invented it , and never was worth inventing at all . And you have borrowed two hundred pounds of me in ninety loans , each of which cost me an hour 's invaluable time : I hold ninety acknowledgments in your handwriting ; and I 'll put them all in force for my protection ; ”
264958	264981	264951	264951	he	902	“ Mr. Colls , take out a writ against this client ; what is your Christian name , sir ? I forget . ”
264982	264985	264987	264989	the gaping client	6988	“ Simon , ”
264995	265001	265003	265004	Mr. Compton	902	“ Thank you , sir , ”
265011	265064	265068	265068	he	902	hostilities—“A writ in the Common Pleas against Simon Macfarlane : keep it in your drawer , Colls , and if ever the said Macfarlane does me the honour to call on me again serve him with it on the spot ; and , if not , not ; good morning , sir . ”
265111	265116	265118	265119	Mr. Colls	903	“ Now , sir , ”
265143	265166	265132	265132	he	6991	“ Well , Mr. Colls , what do you advise ? Is this a moment to beard the lion in his den ? ”
265198	265217	265220	265220	he	903	“ Why , he 'll be as sweet as honey now he has got rid of a client . ”
265392	265423	265381	265382	the attorney	4942	“ You may go . The will is in my pocket : but I made sure he was a madman . They generally are , these ill - used clients . ”
265428	265447	265381	265382	the attorney	4942	“ Got a copy of the settlement , sir , under which you take this ten thousand pounds ? ”
265448	265453	265381	265382	the attorney	4942	“ No , sir . ”
265454	265460	265381	265382	the attorney	4942	“ Any lawyer seen it ? ”
265461	265472	265381	265382	the attorney	4942	“ Oh yes ; Mr. Crauford , down at Barkington . ”
265473	265493	265494	265494	Alfred	312	“ Good . Friend of mine . I 'll write to him . Names and addresses of your trustees ? ”
265498	265515	265494	265494	Alfred	312	“ You have brought the order on which you were confined , and the two certificates ? ”
265516	265520	265522	265522	Alfred	312	“ Not I , ”
265524	265677	265522	265522	Alfred	312	“ I have begged and prayed for a sight of them , and never could get one . That is one of the galling iniquities of the system ; I call it ' THE DOUBLE SHUFFLE . ' Just bring your mind to bear on this , sir : The prisoner whose wits and liberty have been signed away behind his back is not allowed to see the order and certificate on which he is confined — until after his release : that release he is to obtain by combating the statements in the order and certificates . So to get out he must first see and contradict the lies that put him in ; but to see the lies that put him in , he must first get out . So runs the circle of Iniquity . Now , is that the injustice of Earth , or the injustice of Hell ? ”
265686	265759	265678	265679	Mr. Compton	902	“ Well , I think is of the earth , earthy . There 's a mixture of idiocy in it the Devil might fairly repudiate . Young gentleman , the English Statutes of Lunacy are famous monuments of legislatorial incapacity : and indeed , as a general rule , if you want justice and wisdom , do n't you go to Acts of Parliament , but to the Common Law of England . ”
265781	265804	265767	265767	he	312	“ what he could do to punish the whole gang ; his father , the certifying doctors , and the madhouse keepers ? ”
265805	265817	265819	265820	Mr. Compton	902	“ Humph ! You might indict them all for a conspiracy , ”
265822	265921	265819	265820	Mr. Compton	902	“ but you would be defeated . As a rule , avoid criminal proceedings where you have a civil remedy . A jury will give a verdict and damages where they would not convict on the same evidence . Yours is just one of those cases where Temper says , ' indict ! ' but Prudence says , ' sue ! ' and Law , through John Compton , its oracle in this square , says , sue the defendant and no other . Now , who is the true defendant here , or party liable in law ? ”
265922	265932	265767	265767	he	312	“ The keeper of the asylum , for one . ”
265933	265960	265961	265961	He	902	“ No . If I remember right , all proceedings against him are expressly barred by a provision in the last statute . Let us see . ”
265990	265995	265997	265997	Alfred	312	“ Curse the law , ”
266000	266033	265997	265997	Alfred	312	“ No , do n't curse the Law . Curse the Act if you like ; but we ca n't get on without the Law , neither of us . Try again . ”
266034	266041	265767	265767	he	312	“ The certifying doctor , sir ? ”
266042	266045	266047	266048	Mr. Compton	902	“ Humph ! ”
266054	266192	266193	266193	Alfred	312	“ a jury might give you a verdict . But it would probably be set aside by the full court , or else by a court of error . For , unless you could prove informality , barefaced negligence , or mala fides , what does it come to ? A professional man , bound to give medical opinions to all comers , is consulted about you , and says he thinks you are insane : you turn out sane . Well , then , he was mistaken : but not more than he is in most of his professional opinions . We lawyers know what guesswork Medicine is : we see it in the witness - box . I hate suing opinions : it is like firing bullets at snipes in a wind . Try again . ”
266196	266210	266193	266193	Alfred	312	“ Why there is nobody left but the rogue who signed the order . ”
266211	266314	266193	266193	Alfred	312	“ And if you were a lawyer , that alone would tell you he is the defendant . Where a legal wrong has been committed by A. B. and C. , and there is no remedy against A. or B. , there must either be one against C. , or none at all : but this Law abhors as Nature does a vacuum . Besides , this defendant has done the wrong complained of . In his person you sue an act , not an opinion . But of course you are not cool enough to see all this just at first . ”
266315	266320	266322	266322	Alfred	312	“ Cool , sir , ”
266325	266375	266322	266322	Alfred	312	“ I am frozen with your remorseless law . What , of all these villains , may I only attack one , and ca n't I imprison even him , as he has me ? Such narrow law encourages men to violence , who burn under wrongs like mine . ”
266410	266442	266443	266443	Alfred	312	“ If I am to act for you , you had better write a line to the Commissioners of Lunacy requesting them to hand me copies of the order and certificates . ”
266447	266451	266453	266454	Mr. Compton	902	“ And now , ”
266457	266504	266505	266505	Alfred	312	“ I do n't think they will venture to recapture you during the fourteen days . But still they might ; and we attorneys are wary animals . So please give me at once a full authority to act under advice of counsel for your protection . ”
266522	266542	266511	266512	Mr. Compton	902	“ With this I can proceed by law or equity , even should you get into the asylum again . ”
266621	266700	266614	266614	Edward	254	“ Oh , Edward : my worst misgivings ! The two have parted . Poor papa has taken a man 's boat and is in sight . We shall follow directly in a steamboat . But the other ! You know my fears ; you must be father and mother to that poor child till I come home — Your sad mother , Julia held out her hand for the note . Edward put it in his pocket . “
266706	266712	266614	266614	Edward	254	” said the young lady . “
266725	266726	266715	266715	I	0	” “
266740	266741	266743	266743	me	0	” “
266745	266746	266743	266743	me	0	” “
266763	266772	266743	266743	me	0	” and the vivid face looked piteously surprised . “
266820	266821	266807	266807	she	1053	” “
266826	266853	266807	266807	she	1053	” cried Julia , and was for some time too interested and excited to think of anything else . But presently she returned to the charge . “
266859	266860	266861	266861	Humph	911	” “
266870	266871	266861	266861	Humph	911	” “
266895	266912	266913	266913	She	1053	” Edward coloured but said nothing . He thought however , and thus ran his thoughts : “
266936	266937	266930	266930	I	0	” “
266943	266950	266930	266930	I	0	” said Julia , eyeing him . “
266965	267002	266958	266958	you	0	” This fulminated , she drew herself up proudly and was silent . A minute afterwards , stealing a look at her , he saw her eyes suddenly fill with tears , apropos of nothing tangible . “
267008	267072	267073	267073	Hannah	759	” said he to himself At noon she put on her bonnet to visit her district . He put on his hat directly , and accompanied her . Great was her innocent pleasure at that : it was the first time he had done her the honour . She took him to her poor people , and showed him off with innocent pride . “
267080	267086	267073	267073	Hannah	759	” Then in a whisper , “
267092	267104	267089	267089	he	12186	” Presently she saw him looking pale ; unheard of phenomenon ! “
267112	267116	267108	267108	you	12186	” said she . “
267125	267126	267089	267089	he	12186	” “
267131	267135	267089	267089	he	12186	” said he . “
267167	267168	267153	267153	I	0	” “
267210	267211	267207	267207	you	254	” “
267236	267237	267214	267214	I	0	” “
267253	267254	267255	267257	A young duffer	7021	” “
267276	267277	267282	267282	he	7021	” “
267294	267349	267287	267287	I	0	” No answer . The next day he accompanied her again , but remained at the stairfoot while she went in to her patients ; and , when she came down , asked her , Could no good Christian be found to knock that poor woman on the head who lived in a plate . “
267357	267361	267352	267352	Heathen	912	” said Julia . “
267366	267370	267371	267372	the savages	7022	” said he ; “
267378	267430	267371	267372	the savages	7022	” He also accompanied her shopping , and smoked phlegmatically outside the shops ; nor could she exhaust his patience . Then the quick girl put this and that together . When they were at home again and her bonnet off , she looked him in the face and said sweetly , “
267439	267447	267371	267372	the savages	7022	” He smiled , and said nothing . “
267454	267459	267451	267451	you	254	” cried Julia impetuously . “
267491	267492	267485	267485	you	254	” “
267673	267717	267657	267657	you	254	” Then , with one of her old rapid transitions , she began to caress him and fawn on him : she seated him in an arm - chair and herself on a footstool , and suddenly curling round his neck , murmured , “
267762	267770	267746	267746	mamma	1053	” This last in an exquisite whisper . “
267780	267785	267787	267787	mamma	1053	” said he angrily . “
267797	267798	267789	267789	I	0	” “
267802	267811	267812	267812	you	7031	” she cried , bounding to her feet ; “
267902	267969	267975	267975	you	7037	” And instantly she burst out singing , with inspired eloquence and defiance — But , unable to sustain it , the poor Impetuosity dropped as quickly as she had mounted , and out went her arm on the table , and her forehead sank on her arm , and the tears began to run silently down the sweet face , so brave for a moment . “
267983	267987	267975	267975	you	7037	” said Edward . “
268001	268196	267999	267999	you	7037	” She made him a sign of assent with the hand that was dangling languidly , but she did not speak ; nor did she appeal to him any more . Alienation was commencing . But what was worse than speaking her mind , she was for ever at the window now , looking up and down the street ; and walking with her he felt her arm often tremble , and sometimes jerk . The secret was agitating her nerves , and destroying her tranquillity as much , or perhaps more , than if she had known all . Mrs. Dodd wrote from Portsmouth : whereof anon . Mr. Peterson called , and soon after him Mr. Hurd . Edward was glad to see them , especially the latter , whose visits seemed always to do Julia good . Moreover , as Peterson and Hurd were rivals , it afforded Edward an innocent amusement to see their ill - concealed aversion to one another , and the admirable address and delicacy with which his sister conducted herself between them . However , this pastime was cut short by Sarah coming in and saying , “
268209	268217	268199	268201	a young man	10852	” Julia looked up and changed colour . “
268225	268272	268220	268220	he	10852	” said Sarah . She knew very well he was a fireman , and also one of her followers . Edward went out and found one of his late brethren , who told him a young gentleman had just been inquiring for him at the station . “
268278	268279	268275	268275	he	10852	” “
268298	268299	268294	268296	a tall one	7043	” “
268303	268304	268294	268296	a tall one	7043	” “
268308	268309	268294	268296	a tall one	7043	” “
268316	268421	268294	268296	a tall one	7043	“ No : I did n't speak to him : it was Andrew . Andrew says he asked if there was a fireman called Dodd : so Andrew said you had left ; then the swell asked where you lived , and Andrew could n't tell him any more than it was in Pembroke Street . So I told him , says I , ' Why could n't you call me ? It is number sixty - six , ' says I. ' Oh , he is coming back , ' says Andrew . However , I thought I 'd come and tell you . ”
268545	268797	268803	268803	he	7049	“ What a headpiece mamma has ! But it did not strike her he would come to me first . Yet how plain that looks now : for of course I 'm the duffer 's only clue to Julia . These madmen are no fools , though . And how quiet he was that night ! And he made papa go down the ladder first : that was the old Alfred Hardie ; he was always generous : vain , overhearing , saucy , but noble with it all . I liked him : he was a man that showed you his worst , and let you find his best out by degrees . He hated to be beat : but that 's no crime . He was a beautiful oar , and handled his mawleys uncommon ; he sparred with all the prizefighters that came to Oxford , and took punishment better than you would think ; and a wonderful quick hitter ; Alec Reed owned that . Poor Taff Hardie ! And when I think that God has overthrown his powerful mind , and left me mine , such as it is ! But the worst is my having gone on calling him ' the Wretch ' all this time : and nothing too bad for him . I ought to be ashamed of myself . It grieves me very much . ' When found make a note on ; ' never judge a fellow behind his back again . ”
268983	268991	268992	268992	he	7049	“ Why that is near our house , ”
269025	269033	269034	269034	he	7049	“ What on earth is the matter ? ”
269037	269049	269034	269034	he	7049	“ The matter ? Plenty 's the matter , young man , ”
269053	269059	269061	269061	another	1228	“ Murder 's the matter , ”
269090	269102	269071	269073	An intelligent man	7061	“ Yes . For mercy 's sake , what is it ? ”
269103	269108	269110	269111	the man	8724	“ Make way there ! ”
269113	269143	269110	269111	the man	8724	“ He belongs . Sir , a madman has broke loose and got into your house . And I 'm sorry to say he has just killed two men . ”
269144	269149	269151	269152	several voices	7064	“ With a pistol , ”
269368	269383	269385	269385	Alfred	312	“ To Thomas Hardie ? Why , what has he to do with it ? ”
269387	269396	269407	269407	he	312	“ He is the defendant in the suit . ”
269443	269447	269449	269449	he	312	“ And there , ”
269451	269467	269449	269449	he	312	“ lies the order ; signed by Thomas Hardie , of Clare Court , Yorkshire . ”
269468	269473	269475	269475	Alfred	312	“ Curse his impudence , ”
269480	269494	269475	269475	Alfred	312	“ why , sir , he is next door to an idiot himself . ”
269495	269582	269584	269584	he	312	“ What does that matter ? Ah , now , if I had gone in a passion and indicted him , there would be a defence directly ; ' no malice , defendant being non compos . ' Whereas , by gently , quietly suing him , even if he was a lunatic , we would make him or his estate pay a round sum for falsely imprisoning a sane Briton . By - the - by , here is counsel 's opinion on your case , ”
269637	269645	269647	269647	Alfred	312	“ Why it is dead against me , ”
269649	269661	269647	269647	Alfred	312	“ There goes the one rotten reed you had left me . ”
269662	269666	269668	269669	the attorney	4942	“ Singularly dead , ”
269672	269808	269668	269669	the attorney	4942	“ he does not even say ' I am of opinion . ' He is in great practice , and hardworked : in his hurry he has taken up the Lunacy Acts , and has forgotten that the rights of sane Englishmen are not the creatures of these little trumpery statutes . No , thank you ; our rights are centuries older , and prevail wherever , by good luck , the statutes of the realm are silent ; now they are all silent about incarcerating sane men . Besides , he gives no cases . What is an opinion without a precedent ? A lawyer 's guess . I thought so little of his opinion that I sent the case to a clever junior , who has got time to think before he writes . ”
269828	269837	269820	269821	Mr. Compton	902	“ Now let us see what he says , ”
269847	269969	269970	269970	I	0	“ There was clearly a right of action under the common law and it has been exercised . Anderdon v. Brothers ; Paternoster v. Wynn , & c. Such a right can only be annulled by the express terms of a statute : now the 8 and 9 Victoria , cap . 100 , sect . 99 , so annuls it as against the madhouse proprietor only . That , therefore , is the statutory exception , and tends to confirm the common right . If the facts are as represented ( on which , of course , I can form no opinion ) , Mr. Hardie can safely sue the person who signed the order for his alleged false imprisonment . “
270159	270165	270175	270175	Hardie	778	“ ( Signed ) BARROW . “
270190	270191	270175	270175	Hardie	778	” “
270199	270204	270175	270175	Hardie	778	” inquired Alfred satirically . “
270226	270234	270236	270236	Alfred	312	” You appear sanguine , Mr. Compton , ”
270238	270259	270236	270236	Alfred	312	“ perhaps you would not mind advancing me a little money . I 've only half - a - crown . ”
270260	270271	270273	270273	Compton	902	“ It is all ready for you in this drawer , ”
270276	270290	270273	270273	Compton	902	“ See thirty sovereigns . Then you need not go to a bank . ”
270291	270300	270236	270236	Alfred	312	“ What , you knew I should borrow ? ”
270301	270320	270236	270236	Alfred	312	“ Do n't all my clients begin by bleeding me ? It is the rule of this office . ”
270321	270331	270273	270273	Compton	902	“ Then why do n't you give up business ? ”
270332	270352	270353	270353	He	902	“ Because I bleed the opposite attorney 's client a pound or two more than my own bleeds me . ”
270901	270917	270896	270896	He	312	“ If I find her , I shall perhaps wish I had never sought her . ”
271178	271188	271171	271175	a woman of the people	7129	“ It 's a soul singing without a body . ”
271252	271262	271263	271263	he	312	“ ' Wretch that I was to doubt her , ”
271305	271309	271310	271310	he	312	“ Miss Dodd ? ”
271317	271330	271310	271310	he	312	“ you need not announce me . I am an old acquaintance . ”
271658	271669	271671	271672	Mr. Hurd	723	“ Is this intrusion agreeable to you , Miss Dodd ? ”
271698	271703	271705	271705	Alfred	312	“ Pray , sir , ”
271712	271723	271705	271705	Alfred	312	“ have you any right to interfere between us two ? ”
271724	271728	271730	271730	Julia	255	“ None whatever , ”
271733	271771	271730	271730	Julia	255	“ Mr. Hurd , I need no one : I will permit no one to say a word to him . Mr. Hardie knows he can not enter a house where I am — without an explanation . ”
271772	271781	271705	271705	Alfred	312	“ What , before a couple of curates ? ”
271782	271793	271795	271795	Julia	255	“ Do not be insolent to my friends , sir , ”
271804	271811	271813	271813	he	312	“ Oh , as you please , ”
271815	271840	271813	271813	he	312	“ Only if you put me on my defence before strangers , I shall , perhaps , put you to the blush before them . ”
271841	271850	271852	271852	Julia	255	“ Why do you come here , sir ? ”
271861	271867	271852	271852	Julia	255	“ To see my betrothed . ”
271868	271873	271875	271875	she	255	“ Oh , indeed ! ”
271878	271891	271875	271875	she	255	“ in that case why have you postponed your visit so long ? ”
271892	271898	271813	271813	he	312	“ I was in prison . ”
271899	271903	271852	271852	Julia	255	“ In prison ? ”
271904	271938	271939	271939	He	312	“ In the worst of all prisons ; where I was put because I loved you ; where I was detained because I persisted in loving you , you faithless , inconstant girl . ”
271968	271988	271959	271959	she	255	“ Defend yourself , and then call me as many names as you like . Where was this prison ? ”
271989	271998	271999	272000	The girl	1641	“ It was an asylum : a madhouse . ”
272019	272023	272024	272024	he	312	“ Read that , ”
272045	272049	272051	272051	he	312	“ Read it , ”
272056	272062	272051	272051	he	312	“ that was the decoy . ”
272091	272229	272087	272087	He	312	“ The same villain who defrauded your father of his money , robbed me of my wife and my liberty : that Silverton House was a lunatic asylum , and ever since then ( Oh , Julia , the agony of that day ) I have been confined in one or other of those hells ; sane amongst the mad ; till Drayton House took fire , and I escaped : for what ? To be put on my defence , by you . What have you suffered from our separations compared with the manifold anguish I have endured , that you dare to receive the most injured and constant of mankind like this , you who have had your liberty all this time , and have consoled yourself for my absence with a couple of curates ? ”
272230	272234	272236	272236	Julia	255	“ For shame , ”
272254	272266	272268	272269	Mr. Hurd	723	“ Miss Dodd , will you put up with these insults ? ”
272271	272279	272281	272281	Julia	255	“ Ay , and a thousand more , ”
272285	272387	272281	272281	Julia	255	“ and thank Heaven for them ; they prove his sincerity . You , who have thought proper to stay and hear me insult my betrothed , and put my superior on his defence , look how I receive his just rebuke : Dear , cruelly used Alfred , I never doubted you in my heart , no not for a moment ; forgive me for taunting you to clear yourself ; you who were always the soul of truth and honour . Forgive me : I too have suffered ; for I thought my Alfred was dead . Forgive me . ”
272422	272428	272429	272429	he	7148	“ Oh ! God forbid , ”
272468	272474	272455	272455	herself	255	“ We are not alone . ”
272530	272544	272546	272546	Julia	255	“ Sit by me , my poor darling , and tell me all , ”
272611	272627	272606	272606	she	255	“ I insist on your telling me all — all . It will kill me . ”
272695	272700	272701	272701	he	312	“ I am undone , ”
272704	272730	272701	272701	he	312	“ They are coming to take me again ; and , if they do , they will drug me ; I am a dead man . ”
272731	272734	272736	272736	Julia	255	“ Fly ! ”
272738	272746	272747	272747	He	312	“ fly ! upstairs : the leads . ”
272856	272864	272866	272866	he	8724	“ Come , Mr. Hardie , sir , ”
272868	272881	272866	272866	he	8724	“ that is past a joke : would you murder a man ? ”
272882	272921	272812	272812	he	312	“ It 's no murder to kill an assassin in defence of life or liberty ; and I 'll kill you , Rooke , as I would kill a wasp , if you lay a finger on me . ”
272922	272928	272930	272930	Rooke	856	“ Do you hear that ? ”
272936	272942	272947	272947	Hayes	857	“ Ay , I hear , ”
272949	272961	272947	272947	Hayes	857	“ Then loose the dog . And run in after him . ”
273528	273531	273532	273532	he	854	“ There , ”
273535	273561	273532	273532	he	854	“ where that load of hay is going in : that is the way to it . Now stand you in the yard and watch . ”
274047	274055	274057	274061	one of the new keepers	7208	“ He is down upon his luck , ”
274063	274071	274057	274061	one of the new keepers	7208	“ we shall find him crouched somewhere . ”

' ' Let me see her , ' sid I. ' What for , ' sis he , ' when her own husband applies . ' ' Excuse me , ' sis I , ' I 'm not a bat , I 'm Saampson . ' I went to see her ; she was nairvous and excited . ' Oh , I know what you come about , ' said she . ' But you are mistaken . ' I questioned her kindly , and she told me her husband was a great trile t ' her nairves . I refused to sign . On that disn't the tailor drown himself in the canal nixt day ? He was the madman ; and she knew it all the time , but would n't tell us ; and that 's a woman all over . ”

276072	276080	276068	276068	Julia	255	“ Is this a case for jesting ? ”
276081	276088	276090	276091	the doctor	8653	“ Deevil a jest in it , ”

276557	276824	276555	276555	Alfred	312	“ it looks stranger to you than it is . The moment I found my pistol was gone , I determined to run . I looked down and saw a spout with a great ornamental mouth , almost big enough to sit on ; and , while I was looking greedily at it , three horses came into the yard drawing a load of hay . The waggoner was busy clearing the pavement with his wheel , and the waggon almost stopped a moment right under me . There was a lot of loose hay on the top . I let myself down , and hung by the spout a moment , and then leaped on to the loose hay . Unfortunately there were the hard trusses beneath it , and so I got my sprain . Oh , I say , did n't it hurt ? However , I crept under the hay and hid myself , and saw Wolf 's men come into the yard . By - and - by a few drops of rain fell , and some fellows chucked down a tarpaulin from the loft , and nearly smothered me : so I cut a few air - holes with my penknife . And there I lay , Heaven knows how long : it seemed two days . At last I saw an angel at a window I called her by the name she bears on earth : to my joy she answered , and here I am , as happy as a prince among you all , and devilish hungry . ”

's ruffian - like assault , you would have seen the most ridiculous sight in nature — videlicet , an attorney in a passion . I threw professional courtesy to the winds , and sent Colls off to Clare Court to serve the writ personally . Next day , he found the deft , walking in his garden with Mr. Richard Hardie . Having learned from the servant which was his man , he stepped up and served copy of the writ in the usual way . Deft turned pale , and his knees knocked together , and Colls thinks he mistook himself for a felon , and was going to ask for mercy . But Mr. Richard stopped him , and said his attorneys were Messrs. Heathfield , in Chancery Lane ; and was this the way Mr. Compton did business ? serving a writ personally on a gentleman in weak health . So Colls , who can sneer in his quiet way , told him ' No , ' but the invalid had declined to answer my letter , and the invalid had made a violent attack upon our client 's person , avoiding his attorney , ' so , as his proceedings are summary , we meet him in kind , ' says little Colls . ' Oho , ' says Mr. Richard , ' your are a wit , are you ? Come and have some luncheon . ' This was to get him away from the weaker brother , I take it . He gave Colls an excellent luncheon , and some admirable conversation on policy and finance : and when he was going , says this agreeable host : ' Well , Mr. — — - , you have had your bellyful of chicken and Madeira ; and your client shall have his bellyful of law . ' And this Colls considers emphatic but coarse.—I am , yours faithfully , “

No enemy was near : the press had swept the street alike of keepers and police with one Briarian gesture . He found Julia and Edward in great anxiety about their father . The immediate cause was a letter from Mrs. Dodd , which Edward gave him to read ; but not till he had first congratulated him heartily on the aegis of the press being thrown over him . “

280222	280319	280218	280218	Alfred	312	“ He was not very safe , for he was almost burnt to death . The fire liberated him , not I. After the fire I ran away from him : he followed me ; and then what could I do ? I made the best of it ; and gave up my own desires to try and cure him . He longed for the sea : I tried to indulge him : I hoped to bring him back to you sane : but fate was against me . I am the most unfortunate of men . ”

280329	280377	280326	280327	Mrs. Dodd	253	“ what you have done was the act of a madman ; and , if I believed you to be anything but a madman , the sight of you would be intolerable to me ; for you have made me a widow , and my children orphans . ”

281188	281199	281185	281185	Julia	255	“ she is not disfigured ; oh far from that . ”
281200	281243	281021	281021	she	255	“ Julia , you alarm me . This comes of shutting her brother up . May Heaven 's eternal curse light on those who did it . My poor little sister ! How you weep , Julia . My heart is lead . ”
281244	281256	281021	281021	she	255	“ I weep for you , darling , not for her . ”
281257	281287	281021	281021	she	255	“ Ah , that is how they talk when those we love are —— One word ! I shall never see my poor little Jenny again ; shall I ? ”
281288	281381	281021	281021	she	255	“ Yes , Alfred ; if you will but follow her steps and believe in Him , who soothed her last hour , and made her face shine with joy like an angel 's while we all wept around . Oh dear , oh dear , oh dear , he said he had but one true friend in the world . Alas it is so ; you have but me now , who pity you and love you more than heart can utter ; my own , my beloved , my bereaved . ”
281510	281531	281484	281484	she	7391	“ Oh , if I had only been kinder to her ! if I had but been kinder to her ! ”
281532	281539	281541	281541	Julia	255	“ You were kind to her , ”
281547	281589	281541	281541	Julia	255	“ Oh , no ; I was always sneering at her . And why ? I knew her religion was sincere : but my little mind fixed on a few phrases she had picked up from others , and I — — ”
281636	281639	281641	281641	Julia	255	“ Alfred , ”
281643	281821	281822	281822	He	7394	“ do not torment yourself . We girls care little about a few sarcasms ; it is the cold heart that wounds us . You loved Jane , and she knew it well , and joyed in it . You were kinder to her than you think , and so her dying thoughts were for you . It was for you she asked , and made your father send for you , and poor I hoped you would come . And , dearest , her last act was to write a few words to you , and trust them to her who she knew loved you better than heart can utter . Since it was her wish , let us try and read them together , the last words of a saint ( I have never seen them ) , and , if they do not prove words of love , then I will let you think you were not a good brother to her you and I , and poor , poor Edward , have lost . ”

283601	283697	283698	283698	She	7452	“ Your mother , your brother , your curates that would come buzzing the moment I left ; your sick people , who bask on your smiles and your sweet voice till I envy them : Sarah , whom you permit to brush your lovely hair , the piano you play on , the air you deign to breathe and brighten , everybody and everything that is near you ; they are all my rivals ; and shall I resign you to them , and leave myself desolate ? I 'm not such a fool . ”

284041	284079	284031	284031	he	312	“ So be it . I 'll get the trial over , and my sanity established , as soon as possible : and then I 'll hire a yacht and hunt her husband till I find him . ”
284137	284142	284144	284145	poor Julia	255	“ Ah , mamma , ”
284147	284161	284144	284145	poor Julia	255	“ you do n't love me as you did once . Poor Alfred ! ”
284246	284255	284257	284257	she	255	“ You have subjected yourself to a rebuff , ”
284260	284312	284257	284257	she	255	“ and one from which I should have saved you . Is it nothing that mamma out of pity to me connives at our meeting and spending hours together ? Do you think she does no violence to her own wishes here ? and is she to meet with no return ? ”
284313	284322	284324	284325	poor Alfred	312	“ What , are you against me too ? ”
284327	284342	284324	284325	poor Alfred	312	“ No , it is you who are our enemy with your unreasonable impatience . ”
284343	284357	284257	284257	she	255	“ I am not so cold - blooded as you are , certainly . ”
284358	284394	284257	284257	she	255	“ Humility and penitence would become you better than to retort on me . I love you both , and pray God on my knees to show me how to do my duty to both . ”
284395	284440	284324	284325	poor Alfred	312	“ That is it ; you are not single - hearted like me . You want to please all the world , and reconcile the irreconcilable . It wo n't do : you will have to choose between your mother and me at last . ”
284441	284451	284257	284257	she	255	“ Then of course I shall choose my mother . ”
284452	284455	284257	284257	she	255	“ Why ? ”
284456	284501	284257	284257	she	255	“ Because she claims my duty as well as my love ; because she is bowed down with sorrow , and needs her daughter just now more than you do ; besides , you are my other self , and we must deny ourselves . ”
284502	284522	284324	284325	poor Alfred	312	“ We have no more right to be unjust to ourselves than to anybody else ; injustice is injustice . ”
284523	284572	284257	284257	she	255	“ Alfred , you are a high - minded Heathen , and talk Morality . Morality is a snare . What I pray to be is a Christian , as your dear sister was , and to deny myself ; and you make it , oh so difficult . ”
284573	284599	284257	284257	she	255	“ So I suppose it will end in turning out your heathen and then taking your curate . Your mother would consent to that directly . ”
284600	284603	284605	284605	Julia	255	“ Alfred , ”
284609	284673	284605	284605	Julia	255	“ these words are harsh , and — forgive me for saying so — they are coarse . Such words would separate us two , without my mother , if I were to hear many of them ; for they take the bloom off affection , and that mutual reverence , without which no gentleman and lady could be blessed in holy wedlock . ”
284688	284691	284693	284693	Julia	255	“ Alfred , ”
284697	284737	284693	284693	Julia	255	“ do not think me behind you in affection , but wiser , for once , and our best friend . I do think we had better see less of one another for a time , my poor Alfred . ”
284738	284750	284605	284605	Julia	255	“ And why for a time ? Why not for ever ? ”
284751	284763	284693	284693	Julia	255	“ If your heart draws no distinction , why not indeed ? ”
284764	284791	284693	284693	Julia	255	“ So be it then : for I will be no woman 's slave . There 's my hand , Julia : let us part friends . ”
284792	284817	284824	284824	he	7464	“ Thank you for that , dear Alfred : may you find some one who can love you more — than — I do . ”
284840	284948	284949	284949	He	7465	“ If I had been as weak and inconstant as you are , I might have been out of Drayton House long before I did escape . But I was faithful to my one love . I have some right to sing ' Aileen Aroon , ' you have none . You are an angel of beauty and goodness ; you will go to Heaven , and I shall go to the devil now for want of you ; but then you have no constancy nor true fidelity : so that has parted us , and now nothing is left me but to try and hate you . ”
284956	284966	284968	284968	Julia	255	“ God bless you , go where you will , ”
285124	285243	285108	285108	Edward	254	“ Suppose my mother , with her present feelings , was to take a leaf out of your book , and use all her power ; where would you be then ? Come , old fellow , I know what love is , and one of us shall have the girl he loves , unless any harm should come to my poor father owing to your blunder — oh , that would put it out of the question , I feel — but let us hope better . I pulled you out of the fire , and somehow I seem to like you better than ever after that ; let me pull you out of this mess too . ”
285244	285248	285250	285252	the impetuous youth	8529	“ Pull away , ”
285254	285290	285250	285252	the impetuous youth	8529	“ I 'll trust you with my life : ay , with more than my life , with my love ; for you are the man for me : reason is always uppermost with you : “
285314	285333	285339	285340	the ancients	6261	” He assented ; but in the middle of putting on his coat , made this little observation : “
285389	285390	285339	285340	the ancients	6261	” “
285402	285421	285400	285400	Julia	255	” They went over ; Mrs. Dodd was in the city . Edward ushered in Alfred , saying , “
285428	285458	285400	285400	Julia	255	” and sagely retired for a few minutes . When he came back they were sitting hand in hand , he gazing on her , she inspecting the carpet . “
285464	285469	285339	285340	the ancients	6261	” said Edward drily : “
285491	285555	285561	285561	You	8529	” The proposal fell like a blight upon the reconciled lovers . But Edward gave potent reasons . The delays of law were endless : Alfred 's defendant had already obtained one postponement of the trial on frivolous grounds . Now the Oxford examination and Doncaster races come on at a fixed date , by a Law of Nature , and admit of no “
285559	285560	285561	285561	You	8529	” “
285634	285643	285631	285632	Mr. Bombast	941	” He ended with great though quiet force : “
285665	285778	285631	285632	Mr. Bombast	941	” Similes are no arguments ; that is why they convince people so : Alfred capitulated to the scissors and thread ; and only asked with abnormal humility to be allowed to taste the joys of reconciliation for two days . The third found him at Oxford ; he called on the head of his college to explain what had prevented his return to Exeter in the October term twelve months ago , and asked for rooms . Instead of siding with a man of his own college so cruelly injured , the dignitary was alarmed by the bare accusation , and said he must consider : insanity was a terrible thing . “
285790	285795	285631	285632	Mr. Bombast	941	” said Hardie bitterly . “
285813	286218	285799	285799	I	0	” In short , he could give no answer ; must consult the other officers , and would convey the result by letter . Alfred 's pride was deeply mortified , not less by a certain cold repugnant manner than by the words . And there came over his heart a sickening feeling that he was now in the eyes of men an intellectual leper . He went to another college directly , and applied to the vice - president , the vice - president sent him with a letter to the dean ; the dean looked frightened ; and told him hesitatingly the college was full ; he might put his name down , and perhaps get in next year . Alfred retired , and learned from the porter that the college was not full . He sighed deeply , and the sickening feeling grew on him ; an ineradicable stigma seemed upon him , and Mrs. Dodd was no worse than the rest of the world then ; every mother in England would approve her resolutions . He wandered about the scenes of his intellectual triumphs : he stood in the great square of the schools , a place ugly to unprejudiced eyes , but withal somewhat grand and inspiring , especially to scholars who have fought their keen and bloodless battles there . He looked at the windows and gilt inscription of the Schola Metaphysices , in which he had met the scholars of his day and defeated them for the Ireland . He wandered into the theatre , and eyed the rostrum , whence he had not mumbled , but recited , his Latin prize poem with more than one thunder of academic applause : thunder compared with which Drury Lane 's us a mere cracker . These places were unchanged ; but he , sad scholar , wandered among them as if he was a ghost , and all these were stony phantoms of an intellectual past , never , never to return . He telegraphed Sampson and Edward to furnish him with certificates that he had never been insane , but the victim of a foul conspiracy ; and , when he received them , he went with them to St. Margaret 's Hall ; for he had bethought him that the new principal was a first - rate man , and had openly vowed he would raise that “
286226	286275	286277	286277	me	0	” to a place of learning . Hardie called , sent in his card , and was admitted to the principal 's study . He was about to explain who he was , when the doctor interrupted him , and told him politely he knew him by reputation . “
286280	286285	286277	286277	me	0	” said he shrewdly , “
286301	286329	286277	286277	me	0	” Then Alfred began to quake , and , instead of replying , put a hand suddenly before his face , and lost courage for one moment . “
286335	286340	286332	286333	Mr. Hardie	312	” said the principal , “
286377	286378	286379	286379	Sir	1075	” “
286381	286386	286379	286379	Sir	1075	” said Alfred sadly , “
286401	286402	286379	286379	Sir	1075	” “
286409	286436	286379	286379	Sir	1075	” said Dr. Alder guardedly . He told it , omitting nothing essential that could touch the heart or excite the ironical humour of an academician . “
286448	286565	286566	286567	Mr. Hardie	312	” said the doctor . And I conclude the readers of this tale are all of the doctor 's opinion ; so sweet to the mind is ca nt . Alfred offered his certificates . Now Dr. Alder had been asking himself in what phrases he should decline this young genius , who was sane now , but of course had been mad , only had forgotten the circumstance . But the temptation to get an Ireland scholar into his Hall suddenly overpowered him . The probability that he might get a first - class in a lucid interval was too enticing ; nothing venture , nothing have . He determined to venture a good deal . “
286569	286573	286566	286567	Mr. Hardie	312	” said he , “
286619	287016	287021	287021	she	7477	” Now this fine speech , like Minerva herself , came from the head . Alfred was overcome by it to tears . At that the doctor 's heart was touched , and even began to fancy it had originated that noble speech . It was no use doing things by halves ; so Dr. Alder gave Alfred a delightful set of rooms ; and made the Hall pleasant to him . He was rewarded by a growing conviction that he had made an excellent acquisition . This opinion , however , was anything but universal : and Alfred finding the men of his own college suspected his sanity , and passed jokes behind his back , cut them all dead , and confined himself to his little Hall . There they petted him , and crowed about him , and betted on him for the schools as freely as if he was a colt the Hall was going to enter for the Derby . He read hard , and judiciously , but without his old confidence : he became anxious and doubtful ; he had seen so many first - rate men just miss a first - class . The brilliant creature analysed all his Aristotelian treatises , and wrote the synopses clear with marginal references on great pasteboard cards three feet by two , and so kept the whole subject before his eye , till he obtained a singular mastery . Same system with the historians : nor did he disdain the use of coloured inks . Then the brilliant creature drew lists of all the hard words he encountered in his reading , especially in the common books , and read these lists till mastered . The stake was singularly heavy in his case , so he guarded every crevice . And at this period he was not so unhappy as he expected . The laborious days went swiftly , and twice a week at least came a letter from Julia . Oh , how his grave academic room with oaken panels did brighten , when her letter lay on the table . It was opened , and seemed written with sunbeams . No quarrels on paper ! Absence made the heart grow fonder . And Edward came to see him , and over their wine let out a feminine trait in Julia . “
287074	287087	287064	287064	echo	946	” And , after puffing in silence awhile , he said resignedly , “
287094	287095	287099	287099	you	0	” “
287101	287116	287099	287099	you	0	” said the other serenely ; for he was also under the benign influence . “
287119	287123	287099	287099	you	0	” said Edward , “
287150	287562	287141	287141	I	0	” Alfred forgave him . And thus his whole life was changed , and for nearly twelve months ( for Dr. Alder let him reside in the Hall through the vacation ) he pursued the quiet tenor of a student 's life , interrupted at times by law ; but that is another topic . WIFE AND NO WIFE . Mrs. Dodd was visibly shaken by that calamity which made her shrink with horror from the sight of Alfred Hardie . In the winter she was so unwell that she gave up her duties with Messrs. Cross and Co. Her connection with them had been creditable to both parties . I believe I forgot to say why they trusted her so ; well , I must tell it elsewhere . David off her hands , she was independent , and had lost the motive and the heart for severe work . She told the partners she could no longer do them justice , and left them , to their regret . They then advised her to set up as a milliner , and offered her credit for goods at cash prices up to two thousand pounds . She thanked them like a sorrowful queen , and went her way . In the spring she recovered some spirit and health ; but at midsummer a great and subtle misfortune befell her . Her mind was bent on David night and day , and used to struggle to evade the laws of space that bind its grosser companion , and find her lost husband on the sea . She often dreamt of him , but vaguely . But one fatal night she had a dream as clear as daylight , and sharp as white pebbles in the sun . She was on a large ship with guns ; she saw men bring a dead sailor up the side ; she saw all their faces , and the dead man 's too . It was David . His face was white . A clear voice said he was to be buried in the deep next morning . She saw the deck at her feet , the breeches of the guns , so clear , so defined , that , when she awoke , and found herself in the dark , she thought reality was the illusion . She told the dream to Julia and Edward . They tried to encourage her , in vain . “
287567	287571	287563	287563	I	0	” she said , “
287602	287621	287594	287594	I	0	” Dr. Sampson ridiculed her dream to her face . But to her children he told another story . “
287628	287632	287622	287622	I	0	” he said , “
287679	288055	287659	287659	She	7491	” Her children could not console her ; they tried , but something hung round their own hearts , and chilled every effort . In a word , they shared her fears . How came she to see him on board a ship with guns ? In her waking hours she always said he was on a merchant ship . Was it not one of those visions , which come to mortals and give them sometimes a peep into Space , and , far more rarely , a glance into Time ? One day in the autumn , Alfred , being in town on law business , met what seemed the ghost of Mrs. Dodd in the streets . She saw him not ; her eye was on that ghastly face she had seen in her dreams . It flashed through his mind that she would not live long to part him and Julia . But he discouraged the ungenerous thought ; almost forgave her repugnance to himself , and felt it would be worse than useless to ask Julia to leave her mother , who was leaving her visibly . But her horror of him was anything but softened ; and she used to tell Dr. Sampson she thought the sight of that man would kill her now . Edward himself began to hope Alfred would turn his affections elsewhere . The house in Pembroke Street was truly the house of mourning now ; all their calamities were light compared with this . THE DISTRICT VISITOR . While Julia was writing letters to keep up Alfred 's heart , she was very sad herself Moreover , he had left her for Oxford but a very few days , when she received an anonymous letter ; her first . It was written in a female hand , and couched in friendly and sympathetic terms . The writer thought it only fair to warn her that Mr. Alfred Hardie was passionately fond of a lady in the asylum , and had offered her marriage . If Miss Dodd wished to be deceived , let her burn this letter and think no more of it ; if not , let her insert this advertisement in the Times : “
288061	288193	288194	288194	She	7494	” and her correspondent would communicate particulars by word or writing . What a barbed and poisoned arrow is to the body , was this letter to Julia 's mind . She sat cold as a stone with this poison in her hand . Then came an impetuous impulse to send it down to Alfred , and request him to transfer the other half of his heart to his lady of the asylum . Then she paused ; and remembered how much unjust suspicion had been levelled at him already . What right had she to insult him ? She would try and keep the letter to herself . As to acting upon it , her good sense speedily suggested it came from the rival in question , real or supposed . “
288202	288206	288194	288194	She	7494	” said Julia ; “
288226	288329	288221	288221	she	7494	” She put the letter in her desk , and it rankled in her heart . Hoeret lateri lethalis arundo . She trembled at herself ; she felt a savage passion had been touched in her . She prayed day and night against jealousy . But I must now , to justify my heading , skip some months , and relate a remarkable incident that befell her in the said character . On the first of August in this year , a good Christian woman , one of her patients , asked her to call on Mr. Barkington , that lodged above . “
288359	288360	288361	288361	Barkington	430	” “
288363	288383	288361	288361	Barkington	430	” said Julia , and put her hand to her bosom . She went and tapped at his door . “
288387	288631	288361	288361	Barkington	430	” said a shrillish voice . She entered , and found a weazened old man seated , mending his own coat . He rose , and she told him she was a district visitor . He said he had heard of her ; they called her the beautiful lady in that court . This was news to her , and made her blush . She asked leave to read a chapter to him ; he listened as to some gentle memory of childhood . She prescribed him a glass of port wine , and dispensed it on the instant . Thus physicked , her patient became communicative , and chattered on about his native place — but did not name it — and talked about the people there . Now our district visitor was , if the truth must be told , a compounder . She would permit her pupils to talk about earthly affairs , on condition they would listen to heavenly ones before she went . So she let this old man run on , and he told her he had been a banker 's clerk all his life , and saved a thousand pounds , and come up to London to make his fortune on the Stock Exchange ; and there he was sometimes a bull , and sometimes a bear , and whichever he was , certain foxes called brokers and jobbers got the profit and he the loss . “
288643	288647	288648	288649	The jobbers	7497	” said he . “
288675	289036	289037	289037	He	7501	” Then he told her that there was a crossing - sweeper near the Exchange who came from his native place , and had started as a speculator , and come down to that . Only he called it rising , and used to speak with a shudder of when he dabbled in the funds , and often told him to look sharp , and get a crossing . And lo ! one day when he was cleaned out , and desperate , and hovering with the other ghosts of little capitalists about the tomb of their money , he saw his countryman fall flat , and the broom fly out of his hand . Instantly he made a rush , and so did a wooden - legged sailor ; but he got first to the broom , and began to sweep while others picked up his countryman , who proved dead as a herring ; and he succeeded to his broom , and it made money by the Exchange , though he never could . Still , one day he picked up a pocket - book in that neighbourhood , with a lump of money , which he straightway advertised in — no newspapers . And now , Julia thought it time to interpose the eighth commandment , the golden rule , and such branches of learning . He became a favourite of hers : he had so much to say : she even thought she had seen his face before : but she could not tell where . She gave him good books and tracts ; and read to him , and ploughed his heart with her sweet voice , and sowed the good seed in the furrows — seed which , like wheat or other grain , often seems to fall flat and die , but comes out green after many days . One Saturday she invited him to dine with the servants next day . He came during church time , and went away in the afternoon while she was with her mother . But she asked Sarah , who proved eager to talk about him . “
289113	289128	289095	289095	she	276	” Julia said that was indiscreet ; but after all what did it matter ? “
289134	289138	289132	289132	Miss	7509	” Sarah replied : “
289171	289172	289167	289167	he	7501	” “
289180	289181	289188	289188	he	7501	” “
289192	289203	289188	289188	he	7501	” Then putting on a stolid look , she asked , “
289210	289211	289205	289205	he	7501	” “
289221	289222	289219	289219	he	7501	” “
289226	289230	289231	289231	Miss	7512	” said Sarah ; “
289496	289506	289486	289487	the folks	7522	“ It 's him ! she 's his daughter ! ”
289581	289582	289583	289583	Sarah	281	” “
289585	289589	289583	289583	Sarah	281	” said Julia , “
289648	289966	289646	289646	Sarah	281	” On Monday she called on Mr. Barkington to solve the mystery . But , instead of solving , her visit thickened it : for Mr. Barkington was gone bag and baggage . When Edward was told of this business , he thought it remarkable , and regretted he had not seen the old man . So do I ; for it is my belief Edward would have recognised him . DAVID DODD . The history of a man is the history of his mind . And that is why you have heard so little of late about the simplest , noblest , and most unfortunate of all my personages . Insanity is as various as eccentricity . I have spared the kind - hearted reader some of David 's vagaries . However , when we parted with him , he had settled into that strange phase of lunacy , in which the distant past seems nearly obliterated , and memory exists , but revolves in a narrow round of things present : this was accompanied with a positive illusion , to wit , a fixed idea that he was an able seaman : and , as usual , what mental power he retained came out strongest in support of this idea . All this was marked by a bodily agility somewhat more than natural in a man of his age . Owing to the wind astern , he was enabled to run into Portsmouth before the steam - tug came up with him : and he did run into port , not because he feared pursuit , but because he was desperately hungry ; and he had no suicidal tendencies whatever . He made for a public - house , and called for some bread and cheese and beer ; they were supplied , and then lo ! he had no money to pay for them . “
289981	290124	289978	289979	my bo	10159	” said he coolly . On this the landlord collared him , and David shook him off into the road , much as a terrier throws a rat from him ; then there was a row , and a naval officer , who was cruising about for hands , came up and heard it . There was nothing at all unseamanlike in David 's conduct , and the gentleman took a favourable view of it , and paid the small demand ; but not with unleavened motives . He was the second lieutenant of H. M. frigate Vulture ; she had a bad name , thanks to her last captain , and was short of hands : he took David aside and asked him would he like to ship on board the Vulture . David said yes , and suggested the foretop . “
290128	290133	289978	289979	my bo	10159	” growled the lieutenant , “
290141	290188	290189	290189	You	7529	” He then gauged this Jacky Tar 's intellects ; asked him inter alia how to send a frigate 's foretop gallant yard down upon deck : and to show how seamanship sticks in the brain when once it gets there , David actually told him . “
290194	290199	290189	290189	You	7529	” said the lieutenant , “
290206	290454	290203	290204	a seaman	9547	” and so took him on board the Vulture at Spithead , before Green began to search the town in earnest . Nobody acts his part better than some demented persons do : and David made a very tolerable sailor notwithstanding his forty - five years : and the sea did him good within certain limits . Between him and the past lay some intellectual or cerebral barrier as impenetrable as the great wall of China ; but on the hither side of that wall his faculties improved . Of course , the crew soon found out the gap in his poor brain , and called him Soft Billy , and played on him at first . But by degrees he won their affection ; he was so wonderfully sweet - tempered : and besides his mind being in an abnormal state , he loathed grog , and gave his allowance to his messmates . One day he showed an unexpected trait ; they were lying becalmed in southern latitudes , and , time hanging heavily , each wiled it how he might : one fiddled , another wrote to his Polly , another fished for sharks , another whistled for a wind , scores fell into the form of meditation without the reality , and one got a piece of yarn and amused himself killing flies on the bulwark . Now this shocked poor Billy : he put out his long arm and intercepted a stroke . “
290460	290465	290466	290466	You	7532	” said the operator . “
290470	290484	290466	290466	You	7532	” said Billy solemnly , looking into his face with great dreamy eyes . “
290490	290572	290485	290485	You	7532	” said the other , and lent him a tap on the cheek with the yarn . Billy did not seem to mind this ; his skin had little sensibility , owing to his disorder . Jack recommenced on his flies , and the bystanders laughed . They always laughed now at everything Billy said , as Society used to laugh when the late Theodore Hook asked for the mustard at dinner ; and would have laughed if he had said , “
290586	290711	290712	290712	My	0	” David stood looking on at the slaughter with a helpless puzzled air . At last he seemed to have an idea , he caught Jack up by the throat and knee , lifted him with gigantic strength above his head , and was just going to hurl him shrieking into the sea , when a dozen strong hands interfered , and saved the man . Then they were going to bind Billy hand and foot ; but he was discovered to be perfectly calm ; so they remonstrated instead , and presently Billy 's commander - in - chief , a ship - boy called Georgie White , shoved in and asked him in a shrill haughty voice how he dared do that . “
290715	290725	290726	290726	he	7536	” said Billy , with great humility and placidity , “
290750	290789	290746	290746	I	0	” At this piece of reasoning , and the simplicity and gentle conviction with which it was delivered , there was a roar . It subsided , and a doubt arose whether Billy was altogether in the wrong . “
290792	290796	290746	290746	I	0	” said one , “
290814	290815	290816	290816	I	0	” “
290832	290848	290816	290816	I	0	” said one old salt . Finally , several sided with Billy , and intimated that “
290860	291118	291119	291120	William Thompson	545	” And , indeed , methinks it was lovely and touching that so divine a ray of goodness and superior reason should have shot from his heart or from Heaven across that poor benighted brain . But it must be owned his mode of showing his humanity was somewhat excessive and abnormal , and smacked of lunacy . After this , however , the affection of his messmates was not so contemptuous . Now the captain of the Vulture was Billy 's cousin by marriage . Reginald Bazalgette . Twenty years ago , when the captain was a boy , they were great friends : of late Bazalgette had seen less of him ; still it seems strange he did not recognise him in his own ship . But one or two causes co - operated to prevent that . In the first place , the mind when turned in one direction is not so sharp in another ; and Captain Bazalgette had been told to look for David in a merchant ship bound for the East Indies . In the next place , insanity alters the expression of the face wonderfully , and the captain of a frigate runs his eye over four hundred sailors at muster , or a hundred at work , not to examine their features , but their dress and bearing at the one , and their handiness at the other . The worst piece of luck was that Mrs. Dodd did not know David called himself William Thompson . So there stood “
291121	292047	291119	291120	William Thompson	545	” large as life on the ship 's books , and nobody the wiser . Captain Bazalgette had a warm regard and affection for Mrs. Dodd , and did all he could . Indeed , he took great liberties : he stopped and overhauled several merchant ships for the truant ; and , by - the - by , on one occasion William Thompson was one of the boat 's crew that rowed a midshipman from the Vulture alongside a merchant ship to search for David Dodd . He heard the name and circumstance mentioned in the boat , but the very name was new to him . He remembered it , but only from that hour ; and told his loving tyrant , Georgie White , they had been overhauling a merchant ship and looking for one David Dodd . It was about Midsummer the Vulture anchored off one of the South Sea islands , and sent a boat ashore for fruit . Billy and his dearly beloved little tyrant , Georgie White , were among the crew . Off goes Georgie to bathe , and Billy sits down on the beach with a loving eye upon him . The water was calm : but the boy with the heedlessness of youth stayed in it nearly an hour : he was seized with cramp and screamed to his comrades . They ran , but they were half a mile from the boat . Billy dashed into the water and came up with Georgie just as he was sinking for the last time ; the boy gripped him ; but by his great strength he disentangled himself and got Georgie on his shoulders , and swam for the shore . Meantime the sailors got into the boat , and rowed hastily towards them . Now Billy was undermost and his head under water at times , and Georgie , some thought , had helped strangle him by gripping his neck with both arms . Anyway , by the boy 's account , just as they were getting into shallow water , Billy gave a great shriek and turned over on his back ; and Georgie paddled with his hands , but Billy soon after this sunk like a dead body while the boat was yet fifty yards off . And Georgie screamed and pointed to the place , and the boat came up and took Georgie in ; and the water was so clear that the sailors saw Billy lie motionless at the bottom , and hooked him with a boat hook and drew him up ; but his face came up alongside a deadly white , with staring eyes , and they shuddered and feared it was too late . They took him into a house and stripped him , and rubbed him , and wrapped him in blankets , and put him by the hot fire . But all would not do . Then , having dried his clothes , they dressed the body again and laid him in the boat , and cast the Union Jack over him , and rowed slowly and unwillingly back to the ship , Georgie sobbing and screaming over the body , and not a dry eye in the boat . The body was carried up the side , and uncovered , just as Mrs. Dodd saw in her dream . The surgeon was sent for and examined the body : and then the grim routine of a man - of - war dealt swiftly with the poor skipper . He was carried below to be prepared for a sailor 's grave . Then the surgeon walked aft and reported formally to the officer of the watch the death by drowning of William Thompson . The officer of the watch went instantly to the captain in his cabin and reported the death . The captain gave the stereotyped order to bury him at noon next day ; and the body was stripped that night and sewed up in his hammock , with a portion of his clothes and bedding to conceal the outline of the corpse , and two cannon balls at his feet ; and so the poor skipper was laid out for a watery grave , and covered by the Union Jack . I do n't know whether any of my amorous young readers are much affected by the catastrophe I have just related . If not , I will just remind them that even Edward Dodd was prepared to oppose the marriage of Julia and Alfred , if any serious ill should befall his father at sea , owing to Alfred 's imprudent interference in rescuing him from Drayton House . MINUTE study of my fellow - creatures has revealed to me that there are many intelligent persons who think that a suit at law commences in court . This is not so . Many suits are fought and decided by the special pleaders , and so never come into court ; and , as a stiff encounter of this kind actually took place in Hardie v. Hardie , a word of prefatory explanation may be proper . Suitors come into court only to try an issue : an issue is a mutual lie direct : and towards this both parties are driven upon paper by the laws of pleading , which may be thus summed : 1 . Every statement of the adversary must either be contradicted flat , or confessed and avoided : “
292049	292226	291119	291120	William Thompson	545	” means neutralised by fresh matter . 2 . Nothing must be advanced by plaintiff which does not disclose a ground of action at law . 3 . Nothing advanced by defendant , which , if true , would not be a defence to the action . These rules exclude in a vast degree the pitiable defects and vices that mark all the unprofessional arguments one ever hears ; for on a breach of any one of the said rules the other party can demur ; the demurrer is argued before the judges in Banco , and , if successfully , the faulty plaint or faulty plea is dismissed , and often of course the cause won or lost thereby , and the country saved the trouble , and the suitors the expense of trying an issue . So the writ being served by Plt . 's attorney , and an appearance put in by Deft . 's , the paper battle began by Alfred Hardie , through his attorney , serving on Deft . 's attorney “
292230	292360	291119	291120	William Thompson	545	” This was drawn by his junior counsel , Garrow , and ran thus , after specifying the court and the date : Middlesex to wit Alfred Hardie by John Compton his attorney sues Thomas Hardie For that the Deft . assaulted Plt . gave him into custody to a certain person and caused him to be imprisoned for a long space of time in a certain place to wit a Lunatic Asylum whereby the Plt . was much inconvenienced and suffered much anguish and pain in mind and body and was unable to attend to his affairs and was injured in his credit and circumstances . And the Plt . claims 5000l .. Mr. Compton conveyed a copy of this to Alfred , and said it was a sweet “
292363	292364	291119	291120	William Thompson	545	” “
292367	292371	291119	291120	William Thompson	545	” said Alfred , “
292393	292403	292404	292404	Counsel	13645	” Mr. Compton explained that this was the outline : “
292418	292702	292404	292404	Counsel	13645	” The defendant replied to the above declaration by three pleas . By statute 8 & 9 Vic . , c. 100 , s. 105 . 1 . The Deft . by Joseph Heathfield his attorney says he is not guilty . 2 . And for a further Plea the Deft , says that before and at the time of the alleged imprisonment Plt , was a person of unsound mind and incompetent to take care of himself and a proper person to be taken care of and detained and it was unfit unsafe improper and dangerous that he should be at large thereupon the Deft , being the uncle of the Plt . and a proper person to cause the Plt . to be taken charge of under due care and treatment in that behalf did cause the Plt . to be so taken charge of and detained under due care and treatment , & c. & c. The third plea was the stinger , but too long to cite verbatim ; it went to this tune , that the plaintiff at and before the time & c. had conducted himself like a person of unsound mind & c. and two certificates that he was insane had been given by two persons duly authorised under the statute to sign such certificates , and the defendant had believed and did bona fide believe these certificates to be true , & c. & c. The first of these pleas was a mere formal plea , under the statute . The second raised the very issue at common law the plaintiff wished to try . The third made John Compton knit his brows with perplexity . “
292710	292716	292404	292404	Counsel	13645	” said he to Alfred : “
292766	292767	292757	292757	Colls	712	” “
292773	292774	292768	292769	Mr. Colvin	955	” “
292787	292842	292768	292769	Mr. Colvin	955	” Alfred was staggered . He had thought to ride rough - shod over defendant — a common expectation of plaintiffs ; but seldom realised . Lawyers fight hard . The pleas were taken to Garrow ; he said there was but one course , to demur to No . 3 . So the plaintiff “
292868	293326	292858	292859	the plaintiff	14275	” Defendant rejoined that the same was good in substance , and thus Hardie v. Hardie divided itself into two cases , a question of law for the judges , and an issue for the mixed tribunal loosely called a jury . And I need hardly say that should the defendant win either of them he would gain the cause . Postponing the history of the legal question , I shall show how Messrs. Heathfield fought off the issue , and cooled the ardent Alfred and sickened him of law . In theory every Englishman has a right to be tried by his peers : but in fact there are five gentlemen in every court , each of whom has by precedent the power to refuse him a jury , by simply postponing the trial term after term , until the death of one of the parties , when the action , if a personal one , dies too ; and , by a singular anomaly of judicial practice , if a slippery Deft . ca n't persuade A. or B. , judges of the common law court , to connive at what I venture to call THE POSTPONEMENT SWINDLE , he can actually go to C. , D. , and B. , one after another , with his rejected application , and the previous refusal of the other judges to delay and baffle justice goes for little or nothing ; so that the postponing swindler has five to one in his favour . Messrs. Heathfield began this game unluckily . They applied to a judge in chambers for a month to plead . Mr. Compton opposed in person , and showed that this was absurd . The judge allowed them only four days to plead . Issue being joined , Mr. Compton pushed on for trial , and the cause was set down for the November term . Towards the end of the term Messrs. Heathfield applied to one of the puisne judges for a postponement , on the ground that a principal witness could not attend . Application was supported by the attorney 's affidavit , to the effect that Mr. Speers was in Boulogne , and had written to him to say that he had met with a railway accident , and feared he could not possibly come to England in less than a month . A respectable French doctor confirmed this by certificate . Compton opposed , but the judge would hardly hear him , and postponed the trial as a matter of course ; this carried it over the sittings into next term . Alfred groaned , but bore it patiently ; not so Dr. Sampson : he raged against secret tribunals : “
293415	293433	293412	293412	I	0	” Mr. Compton quietly reminded him there was a direct statement — the French doctor 's certificate . “
293438	293444	293412	293412	I	0	” shrieked Sampson , amazed . “
293492	293493	293471	293471	I	0	” “
293525	293526	293521	293521	I	0	” “
293529	293530	293521	293521	I	0	” “
293537	293538	293533	293533	you	0	” “
293554	293574	293521	293521	I	0	” He wrote off to the prefect of police at Boulogne , and in four days received an answer headed “
293582	293662	293521	293521	I	0	” The prefect informed him there had been no railway accident : but that the Sieur Speers , English subject , had really hurt his leg getting out of a railway carriage six weeks ago , and had kept his room some days ; but he had been cured some weeks , and going about his business , and made an excursion to Paris . On this Compton offered Sampson the shilling . But he declined to take it . “
293670	293674	293521	293521	I	0	” said he ; “
293707	293858	293859	293859	I	0	” The next term came . Mr. Compton delivered the briefs and fees , subpoenaed the witnesses , & c. , and Alfred came up with a good heart to get his stigma removed by twelve honest men in the light of day : but first one case was taken out of its order and put before him , then another , till term wore near an end . Then Messrs. Heathfield applied to another judge of the court for a postponement . Mr. Richard Hardie , plaintiff 's father , a most essential witness , was ill at Clare Court . Medical certificate and letter herewith . Compton opposed . Now this judge was a keen and honourable lawyer , with a lofty hatred of all professional tricks . He heard the two attorneys , and delivered himself to this effect , only of course in better legal phrase : “
293936	294006	294007	294007	You	7562	” To this Mr. Compton nailed him , but the commission took time ; and while it was pending , Mr. Heathfield went to another judge with another disabled witness : Peggy Black . That naive personage was nursing her deceased sister 's children — in an affidavit : and they had scarlatina — surgeon 's certificate to that effect . Compton opposed , and pointed out the blot . “
294019	294023	294007	294007	You	7562	” said he : “
294052	294058	294059	294059	I	0	” The judge nodded assent . “
294064	294085	294059	294059	I	0	” said he . Mr. Heathfield went out from his presence and sent a message by telegraph to Peggy Black . “
294104	294322	294091	294091	yourself	7562	” The accommodating maiden telegraphed back that she had unfortunately taken scarlatina of the children : medical certificate to follow by post . Four judges out of the five were now awake to the move . But Mr. Heathfield tinkered the hole in his late affidavit with Peggy 's telegram , and slipped down to Westminster to the chief judge of the court , who had had no opportunity of watching the growth and dissemination of disease among Deft . 's , witnesses . Compton fought this time by counsel and with a powerful affidavit . But luck was against him . The judge had risen to go home : he listened standing ; Compton 's counsel was feeble ; did not feel the wrong . How could he ? Lawyers fatten by delays of justice , as physicians do by tardy cure . The postponement was granted . Alfred cursed them all , and his own folly in believing that an alleged lunatic would be allowed fair play at Westminster , or anywhere else . Compton took snuff , and Sampson appealed to the press again . He wrote a long letter exposing with fearless irony the postponement swindle as it had been worked in Hardie v. Hardie : and wound up with this fiery peroration : “
294430	294512	294513	294514	The doctor	8653	“ I appeal to you , gentlemen , is not such a suitor sacred in all wise and good men 's minds ? Is he not defendant as well as plaintiff ? Why , his stake is enormous compared with the nominal defendant 's ; and , if I know right from wrong , to postpone his trial a fourth time would be to insult Divine justice , and trifle with human misery , and shock the common sense of nations . ”

294774	294797	294772	294772	he	357	“ I was in the House of Commons last night , and there I saw the defendant 's counsel earwigging the judge . ”
294798	294801	294803	294804	Mr. Compton	902	“ Nonsense , ”
294806	294825	294803	294804	Mr. Compton	902	“ such suspicions are ridiculous . Do you think they can talk of nothing but Hardie v. Hardie ? ”
294826	294863	294772	294772	he	357	“ Mai — dearr sirr — my son met one of Heathfield 's clerks at dinner , and he let out that the trile was not to come off . Put this and that together now . ”
294864	294870	294872	294873	Mr. Compton	902	“ It will come off , ”
294875	294883	294872	294873	Mr. Compton	902	“ and in five minutes at farthest . ”

It would be inconvenient to leave it unfinished ; and I must proceed on circuit the day after to - morrow . It must be a remanet : no man can do more than time allows . ”

295455	295485	295452	295452	he	357	“ With what a sense o ' relief th ' animal flings off the mask of humanity when there is no easy eclat to be gained by putting't on . ”

295745	295840	295865	295865	he	312	“ I had a deal of trouble to find you , sir . But I heard of the great lawsuit between Mr. Alfred and you , and I knew Mr. Heathfield was your solicitor ; so I watched at his place day after day : and at last you came . Oh , I was so pleased when I saw your noble figure ; but I would n't speak to you in the street for fear of disgracing you . I 'm such a poor little guy to be addressing a gentleman like you . ”
295873	295913	295865	295865	he	312	“ My poor Skinner , do you think I would turn up my nose at a faithful old servant like you ? Have a glass of wine with me , and tell me how you have been getting on . ”
296023	296033	296020	296020	Skinner	430	“ Well , sir , I am very poor . ”
296034	296044	296046	296047	Mr. Hardie	312	“ So am I , between you and me , ”
296050	296130	296046	296047	Mr. Hardie	312	“ I do n't mind telling you ; those confounded Commissioners of Lunacy wrote to Alfred 's trustees , and I have been forced to replace a loan of five thousand pounds . That Board always sides with the insane . That crippled me , and drove me to the Exchange : and now what I had left is all invested in time - bargains . A month settles my fate : a little fortune , or absolute beggary . ”
296131	296144	296146	296146	Skinner	430	“ You 'll be lucky , sir , you 'll be lucky , ”
296149	296215	296146	296146	Skinner	430	“ you have such a long head ; not like poor little me ; the Exchange soon burnt my wings . Not a shilling left of the thousand pounds , sir , you were so good as to give me for my faithful services . But you will give me another chance , sir , I know ; I 'll take better care this time . ”
296242	296269	296229	296229	Skinner	430	“ Of course , I could go to the other party : but I should n't like to do that . They would come down handsome . ”
296270	296275	296146	296146	Skinner	430	“ What other party ? ”
296276	296347	296348	296349	Mr. Hardie	312	“ La , sir , what other party ? Why Mrs. Dodd 's , or Mr. Alfred 's ; here 's the trial coming on , you know , and of course if they could get me to go on the box and tell all I know , or half what I know , why the judge and jury would say locking Mr. Alfred up for mad was a conspiracy . ”
296374	296377	296379	296379	he	312	“ What , ”
296382	296410	296379	296379	he	312	“ after all I and mine have done for you and yours , would you be so base as to go and sell yourself to my enemies ? ”
296411	296416	296418	296418	Skinner	430	“ Never , sir , ”
296426	296437	296418	296418	Skinner	430	“ Not if you 'll make a bid for me . ”
296438	296445	296379	296379	he	312	“ How much do you demand ? ”
296446	296453	296379	296379	he	312	“ Only another thousand , sir ? ”
296454	296459	296418	296418	Skinner	430	“ A thousand pounds ! ”
296460	296499	296379	296379	he	312	“ Why , what is that to you , sir ? you are rich enough to buy the eighth commandment out of the tables of ten per cent . : and then the lawsuit , Hardies versus Hardies ! ”
296500	296508	296510	296511	Mr. Hardie	312	“ You have spoken plainly at last , ”
296514	296560	296510	296511	Mr. Hardie	312	“ This is extorting money by threats . Do you know that nothing is more criminal , nor more easy to punish ? I can take you before a magistrate , and imprison you on the instant for this attempt . I will , too . ”
296561	296565	296567	296567	Skinner	430	“ Try it , ”
296570	296576	296567	296567	Skinner	430	“ Where 's your witness ? ”
296577	296582	296583	296583	Peggy	705	“ Behind that screen . ”
296601	296613	296615	296615	Peggy	705	“ I have taken all your words down , Mr. Skinner , ”
296623	296633	296615	296615	Peggy	705	“ Shall I go for a policeman , sir ? ”
296638	296641	296643	296643	he	312	“ Yes , ”
296646	296663	296643	296643	he	312	“ there 's no other course with such a lump of treachery and ingratitude as this . ”
296670	296678	296680	296680	Skinner	430	“ What a hurry you are in , ”
296682	296698	296680	296680	Skinner	430	“ a policeman ought to be the last argument for old friends to run to . ”
296704	296714	296716	296716	he	430	“ Do n't talk of indicting me , sir , ”
296718	296781	296716	296716	he	430	“ it makes me shiver : why how will you look when I up and tell them all how Captain Dodd was took with apoplexy in our office , and how you nailed fourteen thousand pounds off his senseless body , and forgot to put them down in your balance - sheet , so they are not whitewashed off like the rest . ”
296782	296791	296831	296831	He	312	“ Any witnesses to all this , Skinner ? ”
296792	296797	296831	296831	He	312	“ Yes , sir . ”
296798	296801	296716	296716	he	430	“ Who ? ”
296802	296811	296813	296813	Skinner	430	“ Well ; your own conscience for one , ”
296815	296822	296824	296825	Mr. Hardie	312	“ He is mad , Peggy , ”
296843	296934	296831	296831	He	312	“ Nobody was ever seized with apoplexy in my office . Nobody ever gave me 14,000l .. And if this is the probable tale with which you come here to break the law and extort money , leave my house this instant : and if ever you dare to utter this absurd and malicious slander , you shall lie within four stone walls , and learn what it is for a shabby vagabond to come without a witness to his back , and libel a man of property and honour . ”
296983	296991	296992	296994	MR . HARDIE	312	“ I've — got — The Receipt . ”
297012	297015	297017	297017	he	430	“ Ah ! ”
297019	297022	297024	297024	Skinner	430	“ Ah ! ”
297050	297074	297041	297042	Mr. Hardie	312	“ The receipt ( if any ) was flung into the dusthole and carried away . Do you think I have forgotten that ? ”
297075	297084	297024	297024	Skinner	430	“ Do n't you believe it , sir , ”
297089	297158	297041	297042	Mr. Hardie	312	“ While you turned your back and sacked the money , I said to myself , ' Oho , is that the game ? ' and nailed the receipt . What a couple of scoundrels we were ! I would n't have her know it for all your money . Come , sir , I see its all right ; you will shell out sooner than be posted . ”
297163	297179	297160	297160	Peggy	705	“ Mr. Skinner , be more considerate ; my master is really poor just now . ”
297180	297197	297199	297199	Skinner	430	“ That is no reason why I should be insulted and indicted and trampled under foot , ”
297205	297222	297224	297225	Mr. Hardie	312	“ Show me the receipt and take my last shilling , you ungrateful , vindictive viper , ”
297227	297232	297234	297234	Skinner	430	“ Stuff and nonsense , ”
297236	297282	297283	297283	Skinner	430	“ I 'm not a viper ; I 'm a man of business . Find me five hundred pounds ; and I 'll show you the receipt and keep dark . But I ca n't afford to give it you for that , of course . ”
297423	297432	297411	297411	She	705	“ Richard , it 's not worth that . ”
297457	297466	297467	297467	he	312	“ His blood be on his own head , ”
297470	297490	297467	297467	he	312	“ This is not my seeking . He shall learn what it is to drive Richard Hardie to despair . ”
297491	297496	297498	297498	Peggy	705	“ No , no , ”
297500	297532	297498	297498	Peggy	705	“ there are other countries beside this : why not gather all you have , and cross the water ? I 'll follow you to the world 's end , Richard . ”
297533	297539	297541	297541	he	312	“ Mind your own business , ”
297817	297835	297812	297813	Mr. Hardie	264	“ I must ask you , just for form , to show me you have the Receipt . ”
297836	297857	297801	297801	Skinner	430	“ Of course , sir ; but not so near , please : no snatching , if I know it . ”
297858	297864	297866	297867	Mr. Hardie	264	“ You are wonderfully suspicious , ”
297886	297895	297897	297897	he	430	“ Keep your distance a moment , sir , ”
297984	297994	297978	297979	Mr. Hardie	264	“ No ! no ! for Heaven 's sake ! ”
297995	297998	298000	298000	Skinner	430	“ What ! ”
298007	298036	298000	298000	Skinner	430	“ do you think I 'm such a fool as to meet a thief unarmed ? Come , cash up , or I 'll blow you to atoms . ”

298083	298124	298000	298000	Skinner	430	“ Cash up , then ; that 's business . Fling the five hundred pounds down , and walk away . Mind it is loaded with two bullets ; I 'll make a double entry on your great treacherous carcass . ”
298125	298139	298141	298142	Mr. Hardie	264	“ It 's no use trying to deceive such a man as you , ”
298149	298172	298141	298142	Mr. Hardie	264	“ I could not get the money before Saturday , and so I listened to the dictates of despair . Forgive me . ”
298173	298237	298000	298000	Skinner	430	“ Then come again Saturday night . Come alone , and I shall bring a man to see I 'm not murdered . And look here , sir , if you do n't come to the hour and do the right thing without any more of these unbusiness - like tricks , by Heaven , I 'll smash you before noon on Monday . ”
298238	298243	298000	298000	Skinner	430	“ I 'll come . ”
298244	298256	298141	298142	Mr. Hardie	264	“ I 'll blow you to Mr. Alfred and Miss Dodd . ”
298257	298266	298000	298000	Skinner	430	“ I 'll come , I tell you . ”
298267	298282	298000	298000	Skinner	430	“ I 'll post you for a thief on every brick in the Exchange . ”
298283	298308	298141	298142	Mr. Hardie	264	“ Have mercy , Skinner . Have pity on the wretched man whose bread you have eaten . I tell you I 'll come . ”
298309	298322	298324	298324	Skinner	430	“ Well , mind you do , then , cash and all , ”
298580	298588	298589	298589	he	430	“ That 's better than any fire , ”
298592	298634	298589	298589	he	430	“ they warm the heart . For one thing , they are my own : at all events , I did not steal them , nor take them of a thief for a bribe to keep dark and defraud honest folk . ”
298650	298656	298640	298640	he	430	“ To rob an angel , ”
298661	298691	298640	298640	he	430	“ The fourteen thousand pounds is all hers , and I could give it her in a moment . Curse him , he would have killed me for it . ”
298702	298705	298707	298707	he	430	“ Ah , ”
298709	298736	298707	298707	he	430	“ that is all right so far . But what is a paltry three hundred when I help do her out of fourteen thousand ? Villain ! ”
298784	298813	298781	298781	he	430	“ Miss Dodd lives at 66 , Pembroke Street , and I am going to take it to her as soon as I am well of my cold . ”

299058	299099	299100	299100	he	430	“ to come day after day and feed a poor little fellow like him , body and soul . She asked nothing back . She did n't know he could make her any return . Bless her ! bless her ! ”
299103	299187	299100	299100	he	430	“ Oh , how cruel I have been to her , and she so kind to me . She would never let me want , if I took her fourteen thousand pounds . Like enough give me a thousand , and help me save my poor soul , that I shall damn if I meet him again . I wo n't go his way again . Lead us not into temptation . I repent . Lord have mercy on me a miserable sinner . ”
299261	299270	299244	299244	he	7642	“ My head , how heavy it feels . ”

299454	299487	299440	299440	Skinner	430	“ You will never see him again till the day of the trial : and then he will go down and bear false witness against you . Why not leave the country ? ”
299488	299540	299541	299541	Peggy	705	“ How can I , simpleton ? My money is all locked up in the bargains . No , I 'm tied , tied to the stake ; I 'll fight to the last : and , if I 'm defeated and disgraced , I 'll die , and end it . ”

Let me be in that hall with the five hundred pounds , and I promise you he shall never appear against you . We will both go ; you with the money , I with my woman 's tongue . ”
299825	299834	299822	299823	Mr. Compton	902	“ That is your argument , I think . ”

299929	300068	299923	299923	his	7658	“ We are all of opinion that this plea is bad in law . By the common law of England no person can be imprisoned as a lunatic unless actually insane at the time . It has been held so for centuries , and down to the last case . And wisely : for it would be most dangerous to the liberty of the subject , if a man could be imprisoned without remedy unless he could prove mala fides in the breast of the party incarcerating him . As for the statute , it does not mend the matter , but rather the reverse ; for it expressly protects duly authorised persons acting under the order and certificates , and this must be construed to except from the protection of the statute the person making the order . ”
300405	300416	300417	300417	she	255	“ Oh do not go and dispirit him just now , ”
300420	300503	300417	300417	she	255	“ or he will do something rash . No , he must and shall get his first - class , and win his trial ; and then you know any lady will be too proud to marry him , and , when he is married and happy , you can tell him I did all I could for him , and hunted up the witnesses , and was his loving friend , though I could not — be — his — wife . ”

302826	302869	302822	302823	Mr. Colt	972	“ As my learned friend was afraid to cross - examine the plaintiff on any point but this , and as I mean to respond to his challenge , and call Miss Dodd , I will not trouble the plaintiff any further . ”

303456	303472	303429	303430	The serjeant	7778	“ Then , no . Another misfortune has now separated him and me for ever . ”
303473	303480	303446	303446	she	255	“ What is that , pray ? ”
303481	303501	303502	303503	The judge	11149	“ My father is said to have died at sea : and my mother thinks he is to blame . ”

304411	304432	304407	304407	Fullalove	472	“ Of course somebody asked you to drop in here so very accidentally : come now , who was it ? ”
304433	304448	304376	304377	Serjeant Saunders	967	“ I 'm God Almighty 's witness dropped from the clouds , I cal'late . ”
304449	304468	304515	304515	he	7849	“ Come , sir , no prevarication . How came you here just at the nick of time ? ”
304469	304514	304515	304515	he	7849	“ Counsellor , when I 'm treated polite , I 'm ile ; but rile me , and I 'm thunder stuffed with pison : do n't you raise my dander , and I 'll tell you . I have undertaken to educate this yar darkie,”—here

304549	304634	304515	304515	he	7849	“ So I said to him , coming over Westminster Bridge , ' Now there 's a store hyar where they sell a very extraordinary Fixin ; and it 's called Justice ; they sell it tarnation dear ; but prime . So I make tracks for the very court where I got the prime article three years ago , against a varmint that was breaking the seventh and eighth commandments over me , adulterating my patent and then stealing it . Blast him ! ”
304642	304774	304515	304515	he	7849	“ And coming along I said this old country 's got some good pints after all , old hoss . One is they 'll sell you justice dear , but prime in these yar courts , if you were born at Kamschatkee ; and the other is , hyar darkies are free as air , disenthralled by the univarsal genius of British liberty ; and then I pitched Counsellor Curran 's bunkum into this darkie , and he sucked it in like mother 's milk , and in we came on tiptoe , and the first thing we heard was a freeborn Briton treated wus than ever a nigger in Old Kentuck , decoyed away from his gal , shoved into a darned madhouse — the darbies clapped on him — — ”
304775	304788	304939	304939	Saunders	967	“ We do n't want your comments on the case , sir . ”
304789	304903	304515	304515	he	7849	“ No , nor any other free and enlightened citizen 's , I reckon . Wal , Vespasian and me sat like mice in a snowdrift , and hid our feelings out of good manners , being strangers , till his lordship got e - tarnally fixed about the Captain 's pocket - book . Vesp . , says I , this hurts my feelings powerful . Says I , this hyar lord did the right thing about my patent : he summed up just : and now he is in an everlasting fix himself : one good turn deserves another , I 'll get him out of this fix , any way . ”
304966	304980	304962	304962	Saunders	967	“ What , another amicus curiae , my lud ! This is unprecedented . ”
304981	304989	304991	304992	the judge	11149	“ Excuse my curiosity , Brother Saunders , ”
304995	305022	304991	304992	the judge	11149	“ I wish to trace this 14,000l . as far as possible . Have you any particular objection to the truth on this head of evidence ? ”
305023	305040	304954	304954	he	7789	“ No , my lud , I never urge objections when I ca n't enforce them . ”
305041	305049	304991	304992	the judge	11149	“ Then you are a wise man . ”
305061	305077	304954	304954	he	7789	“ Pray did Captain Dodd tell you what he intended to do with this money ? ”
305078	305168	304991	304992	the judge	11149	“ Is , massa judge , massa captan told dis child he got a branker in some place in de old country , called Barkinton . And he said dis branker bery good branker , much sartiner not to break dan the brank of England . ( A howl . ) De captan said he take de money to dis yer branker , and den hab no more trouble wid it . Den it off my stomach , de captan say , and dis child heerd him . Yah ! ”
305199	305229	305230	305230	Compton	902	“ Skinner ! On a hot scent . Sure to find him to - day.—N.B. He is wanted by another party . There is something curious a - foot . ”
305236	305256	305230	305230	Compton	902	“ For Heaven 's sake , bring him directly . In half an hour it will be too late . ”
305344	305376	305330	305331	Mr. Colt	972	“ We are about to call our last witness : the living have testified to my client 's sanity , and now we shall read you the testimony of the dead . ”
305650	305655	305638	305638	he	972	“ Call Edward Dodd . ”
305670	305676	305678	305678	he	254	“ I knew her well , ”
305680	305686	305678	305678	he	254	“ Is that her handwriting ? ”
305687	305691	305638	305638	he	972	“ It is . ”
305692	305698	305678	305678	he	254	“ Where was it written ? ”
305699	305708	305678	305678	he	254	“ In my mother 's house at Barkington . ”
305709	305714	305638	305638	he	972	“ Under what circumstances ? ”
305715	305731	305678	305678	he	254	“ She was dying — of a blow given her by a maniac called Maxley . ”
305732	305735	305737	305738	the judge	11149	“ Maxley ! ”
305742	305843	305737	305738	the judge	11149	“ I remember the Queen v. Maxley . I tried him myself at the assizes : it was for striking a young lady with a bludgeon , of which she died . Maxley was powerfully defended ; and it was proved that his wife had died , and he had been driven mad for a time , by her father 's bank breaking . The jury would bring in a verdict that was no verdict at all ; as I took the liberty to tell them at the time . The judges dismissed it , and Maxley was eventually discharged . ”
305864	305876	305855	305858	the witness.—Did Jane Hardie	276	“ Oh yes , sir . She told us all so . ”
305877	305886	305737	305738	the judge	11149	“ To whom did she give this letter ? ”
305887	305892	305737	305738	the judge	11149	“ To my sister . ”
305893	305905	305855	305858	the witness.—Did Jane Hardie	276	“ Oh , to your sister ? To Miss Julia Dodd ? ”
305906	305924	305737	305738	the judge	11149	“ Yes , sir . But not for herself . It was to give to Alfred Hardie . ”
305925	305947	305737	305738	the judge	11149	“ Can you read the letter ? It is rather faintly written . It is written in pencil , my lord . ”
305948	305976	305977	305979	The young man	1224	“ I could read it , sir ; but I hope you will excuse me . She that wrote it was very , very dear to me . ”
306031	306054	305991	305991	he	1224	“ You misunderstand him . Witnesses do not read letters out in court . Let the letter be handed up to me . ”

306135	306368	306121	306122	his lordship	7789	“ DEAR , DEAR BROTHER,—Your poor little Jane lies dying , suddenly but not painfully , and my last earthly thoughts are for my darling brother . Some wicked person has said you are insane . I deny this with my dying breath and my dying hand . You came to me the night before the wedding that was to be , and talked to me most calmly , rationally and kindly ; so that I could not resist your reasons , and went to your wedding , which , till then , I did not intend . Show these words to your slanderers when I am no more . But oh ! Alfred , even this is of little moment compared with the world to come . By all our affection , grant me one request . Battered , wounded , dying in my prime , what would be my condition but for the Saviour , whom I have loved , and with whom I hope soon to be . He smoothes the bed of death for me , He lights the dark valley ; I rejoice to die and be with Him . Oh , turn to Him , dear brother , without one hour 's delay , and then how short will be this parting . This is your dying sister 's one request , who loves you dearly . ”
306411	306423	306424	306424	he	11149	“ These are the words of a Christian woman , gentlemen , ”
306478	306489	306463	306463	his	972	“ Gentlemen of the jury , that is our case : ”
306653	307171	307175	307175	he	7897	“ Our case , gentlemen , is , that the plaintiff is sane , and that he owes his sanity to those prompt , wise , and benevolent measures , which we took eighteen months ago , at an unhappy crisis of his mind , to preserve his understanding and his property . Yes , his property , gentlemen ; that property which in a paroxysm of mania , he was going to throw away , as I shall show you by an unanswerable document . He comes here to slander us and mulet us out of five thousand pounds ; but I shall show you he is already ten thousand pounds the richer for that act of ours , for which he debits us five thousand pounds instead of crediting us twice the sum . Gentlemen , I can not , like my learned friend , call witnesses from the clouds , from the United States , and from the grave ; for it has not occurred to my client strong in the sense of his kindly and honourable intentions , to engage gentlemen from foreign parts , with woolly locks and nasal twangs , to drop in accidentally , and eke out the fatal gaps in evidence . The class of testimony we stand upon is less romantic ; it does not seduce the imagination nor play upon the passions ; but it is of a much higher character in sober men 's eyes , especially in a court of law . I rely , not on witnesses dropped from the clouds , and the stars , and the stripes — to order ; nor even on the prejudiced statements of friends and sweethearts , who always swear from the heart rather than from the head and the conscience ; but on the calm testimony of indifferent men , and on written documents furnished by the plaintiff ' , and on contemporaneous entries in the books of the asylum , which entries formally describe the plaintiff 's acts , and were put down at the time — at the time , gentlemen — with no idea of a trial at law to come , but in compliance with the very proper provisions of a wise and salutary Act . I shall also lay before you the evidence of the medical witnesses who signed the certificates , men of probity and honour , and who have made these subtle maladies of the mind the special study of their whole life . I shall also call the family doctor , who has known the plaintiff and his ailments , bodily and mental , for many years , and communicated his suspicions to one of the first psychological physicians of the age , declining , with a modesty which we , who know less of insanity than he does , would do well to imitate — declining , I say , to pronounce a positive opinion unfavourable to the plaintiff , till he should have compared notes with this learned man , and profited by his vast experience . ”

307791	307795	307797	307798	the judge	11149	“ In short , ”
307802	307840	307797	307798	the judge	11149	“ Dr. Wycherley took the very thing for granted which it was his duty to ascertain ; and you , sir , not to be behind Dr. Wycherley , took the thing for granted at second hand . ”
307855	307876	307849	307849	he	740	“ If this case is to be defended seriously , you had better call Mr. Richard Hardie without further delay . ”
307877	307914	307797	307798	the judge	11149	“ It is my wish , my lud ; but I am sorry to say he is in the country very ill ; and I have no hope of seeing him here before to - morrow . ”
307915	307962	307963	307964	Mr. Saunders	975	“ Oh , well ; so that you do call him . I shall not lay hearsay before the jury : hearsay gathered from Mr. Richard Hardie — whom you will call in person if the reports he has circulated have any basis whatever in truth . ”
307968	307977	307963	307964	Mr. Saunders	975	“ Mr. Richard Hardie is not the defendant , ”
308107	308113	308115	308115	he	972	“ And pray , sir , ”
308123	308150	308115	308115	he	972	“ do you never stir out of a madhouse ? Do you imagine that gentlemen in their senses dine at two o'clock in the nineteenth century ? ”
308151	308160	308115	308115	he	972	“ No . I do n't say that . ”
308161	308194	308199	308199	Colt	972	“ What do you say , then ? Is forcible imprisonment of a bridegroom in a madhouse the thing to give a gentleman a factitious appetite at your barbarous dinner - hour ? ”
308419	308444	308445	308445	Green	774	“ I am down on Mr. Barkington alias Noah Skinner . It is n't very far from here , if you will follow me . ”
308547	308569	308570	308570	She	255	“ Why your last letter was full of love , dearest ; what could you be thinking of to say that ? ”
308612	308691	308596	308596	she	255	“ I was afraid you would be disheartened , and lose your first class and perhaps your trial . But you are safe now , dear Alfred ; I am sure the judge sees through them ; for I have studied him for you . I know his face by heart , and all his looks and what they mean . My Alfred will be cleared of this wicked slander , and happy with some one —— Ah ! ”
308692	308704	308706	308706	Alfred	312	“ Yes , I mean to be happy with some one , ”
308708	308784	308596	308596	she	255	“ I am not one of your self - sacrificing angels ; thank Heaven ! Your shall not sacrifice us to your mother 's injustice nor to the caprices of fate . We have one another ; but you would immolate me for the pleasure of immolating yourself . Do n't provoke me too far , or I 'll carry you off by force . I swear it , by Him who made us both . ”
308785	308793	308797	308797	Julia	255	“ Dearest , how wildly you talk . ”
308899	308906	308908	308908	Green	774	“ Bring the old gentleman up , ”
308910	308924	308908	308908	Green	774	“ I appointed him six o'clock , and it 's on the stroke . ”

309074	309079	309072	309072	Green	774	“ what is this ? ”
309100	309115	309084	309085	Mr. Skinner	430	“ If you want to see him alive , let me open the door . ”
309116	309123	309125	309125	Green	774	“ There 's something amiss here , ”

315229	315235	315236	315236	I	0	“ justice according to law . ”
315261	315951	315255	315255	Lawyers	2191	“ This is an important , but not a difficult case . The plaintiff sues the defendant under the law of England for falsely imprisoning him in a madhouse . The imprisonment is admitted , and the sufferings of the plaintiff not disputed . The question is , whether he was insane at the time of the act ? Now , I must tell you , that in a case of this kind , it lies upon the defendant to prove the plaintiff 's insanity , rather than on the plaintiff to prove his own sanity . Has the defendant overcome this difficulty ? Illusion is the best proof of insanity ; and a serious endeavour was certainly made to fasten an illusion on the plaintiff about a sum of 14,000l .. But the proof was weak , and went partly on an assumption that all error is hallucination ; this is illusory , and would , if acted on , set one half the kingdom imprisoning the other half ; and after all , they did not demonstrate that the plaintiff was in error . They advanced no undeniable proof that Mr. Richard Hardie has not embezzled this L. 14,000 . I do n't say it was proved on the other hand that he did embezzle that sum . Richard Hardie sueing Alfred Hardie for libel on this evidence might possibly obtain a verdict ; for then the burden of proof would lie on Alfred Hardie ; but here it lies on those who say he is insane . The fact appears to be that the plaintiff imbibed a reasonable suspicion of his own father 's integrity ; it was a suspicion founded on evidence , imperfect , indeed , but of a sound character as far as it went . There had been a letter from Captain Dodd to his family , announcing his return with 14,000l . upon him , and , while as yet unaware of this letter , the plaintiff heard David Dodd accuse Richard Hardie of possessing improperly 14,000,l . the identical sum . At least , he swears to this , and as Richard Hardie was not called to contradict him , you are at liberty to suppose that Richard Hardie had some difficulty in contradicting him on oath . Here , then , true or false , was a rational suspicion , and every man has a right to a rational suspicion of his neighbour , and even to utter it within due limits ; and , if he overstep those , the party slandered has his legal remedy ; but if he omits his legal remedy , and makes an attempt of doubtful legality not to confute , but to stifle , the voice of reasonable suspicion , shrewd men will suspect all the more . But then comes a distinct and respectable kind of evidence for the defendant ; he urges that the plaintiff was going to sign away his property to his wife 's relations . Now , this was proved , and a draft of the deed put in and sworn to . This taken singly has a very extraordinary look . Still , you must consider the plaintiff 's reasonable suspicion that money belonging to the Dodds had passed irregularly to the Hardies , and then the wonder is diminished . Young and noble minds have in every age done generous , self - denying , and delicate acts . The older we get , the less likely we are to be incarcerated for a crime of this character ; but we are not to imprison youth and chivalry merely because we have outgrown them . To go from particulars to generals , the defendant , on whom the proof lies , has advanced hearsay and conjecture , and not put their originators into the box . The plaintiff , on whom the proof does not lie , has advanced abundant evidence that he was sane at the time of his incarceration : this was proved to demonstration by friends , strangers , and by himself . ”
315966	316509	315953	315954	the judge	11149	“ As to the parties themselves , it is curious how they impersonated , so to speak , their respective lines of argument . The representative of evidence and sound reasoning , though accused of insanity , was precise , frank , rational and dignified in the witness - box ; and I think you must have noticed his good temper . The party , who relied on hearsay and conjecture , was as feeble as they are ; he was almost imbecile , as you observed ; and , looking at both parties , it really seems monstrous that the plaintiff should be the one confined as a lunatic , and the defendant allowed to run wild and lock up his intellectual superiors . If he means to lock them all up , even you and I are hardly safe . ( Laughter . ) The only serious question , I apprehend , is on what basis the damages ought to be assessed . The plaintiffs counsel has made a powerful appeal to your passions , and calls for vengeance . Now I must tell you , you have no right to make yourselves ministers of vengeance , nor even to punish the defendant , in a suit of the kind : still less ought you to strike the defendant harder than you otherwise would — in the vague hope of punishing indirectly the true mover of the defendant and the other puppets . I must warn you against that suggestion of the learned counsel 's . If the plaintiff wants vengeance , the criminal law offers it . He comes here , not for vengeance , but for compensation , and restoration to that society which he is every way fitted to adorn . More than this — and all our sympathies — it is not for us to give him . But then the defendant 's counsel went too far the other way . His client , he says , is next door to an idiot , and so , forsooth , his purse must be spared entirely . This is all very well if it could be done without ignoring the plaintiff and his just claim to compensation . Why , if the defendant , instead of being weak - minded , were an idiot or a lunatic , it would protect him from punishment as a felon , but not from damages in a suit . A sane man is not to be falsely imprisoned by a lunatic without full compensation from the lunatic or his estate : a fortiori , he is not to be so imprisoned by a mere fool without just compensation . Supposing your verdict , then , to be for the plaintiff , I think vindictive damages would be unfair , on this feeble defendant , who has acted recklessly , but under an error , and without malice , or bad faith . On the other hand , nominal or even unsubstantial damages would be unjust to the plaintiff ; and perhaps leave in some minds a doubt that I think you do not yourselves entertain , as to the plaintiff 's perfect sanity during the whole period of his life . ”

319395	319649	319393	319393	he	357	“ y ' are goen to maerry int ' a strange family — which , like most of the droll things this man said , was true : for Soft Tommy and Alfred were the two intellectual extremes of the whole tribe of Hardies . Mrs. Archbold , disappointed both in love and revenge , posed her understanding , and soothed her mind , with Frank Beverley and opium . This soon made the former deep in love with her , and his intellect grew by contact with hers . But one day news came from Australia that her husband was dead . Now , perhaps I shall surprise the reader , if I tell him that this Edith Archbold began her wedded life a good , confiding , loving , faithful woman . Yet so it was : the unutterable blackguard she had married , he it was who laboured to spoil her character , and succeeded at last , and drove her , unwilling at first , to other men . The news of his death was like a shower - bath ; it roused her . She took counsel with herself , and hope revived in her strong head and miserable heart . She told Frank , and watched him like a hawk . He instantly fell on his knees , and implored her to marry him directly . She gave him her hand and turned away , and shed the most womanly tear that had blessed her for years . “
319658	319663	319393	319393	he	357	” said poor Frank ; “
319673	319962	319670	319671	a muff	13818	” To make a long story short , she exerted all her intelligence , and with her help Frank took measures towards superseding his Commission of Lunacy . Now , in such a case , the Lord Chancellor always examines the patient in person . What was the consequence ? Instead of the vicarious old Wolf , who had been devouring him at third and fourth hand , Frank had two interviews with the Chancellor himself : a learned , grave , upright gentleman , who questioned him kindly and shrewdly and finding him to be a young man of small intellectual grasp , but not the least idiotic or mad , superseded his commission in defiance of his greedy kinsfolk , and handed him his property . He married Edith Archbold , and she made him as happy as the day was long . For the first year or two she treated his adoration with good - natured contempt ; but , as years rolled on , she became more loving , and he more knowing ! They are now a happy pair , and all between her first honest love , and this her last , seems to her a dream . So you see a female rake can be ameliorated by a loving husband , as well as a male rake by a loving wife . It sounds absurd , and will offend my female readers and their unchristian prejudices , but that black - browed jade is like to be one of the best wives and mothers in England . But then , mind you , she had always — Brains . I do not exactly know why Horace puts together those two epithets , “
319964	319966	320247	320247	Alfred	312	” and “
319971	320078	320247	320247	Alfred	312	” Perhaps he had observed they go together . To be honest , I am not clear whether this is so on the grand scale . But certainly the two features did meet remarkably in one of my characters — Alfred Hardie . The day the bank broke , he had said he would pay the creditors . He now set to work to do it by degrees . He got the names and addresses , lived on half his income , and paid half away to those creditors : he even asked Julia to try and find Maxley out , and do something for him . “
320087	320093	320083	320083	me	0	” said he , trembling , “
320102	320229	320095	320095	I	0	” Maxley was known to be cranky , but harmless , and wandering about the country . Julia wrote to Mr. Green about him : Alfred 's was an uphill game ; but fortune favours the obstinate as well as the bold . One day , about four years after his marriage with Julia , being in London , he found a stately figure at the corner of a street , holding out his hand for alms , too dignified to ask it except by that mute and touching gesture . It was his father . Then , as truly noble natures must forgive the fallen , Alfred was touched to the heart , and thought of the days of his childhood , before temptation came . “
320232	320236	320095	320095	I	0	” said he , “
320243	320244	320238	320238	you	2093	” “
320249	320254	320247	320247	Alfred	312	” said Richard composedly : “
320310	320328	320545	320548	an agent you want	8257	” Alfred bit his lip , had a wrestle with the old Adam ; and said gently , “
320336	320523	320545	320548	an agent you want	8257	” He took him to Barkington , bag and baggage ; and his good Christian wife received the old man with delight ; she had prayed day and night for this reconciliation . Finding his son so warm , and being himself as cool , Richard Hardie entrapped Alfred into an agreement , to board and lodge him , and pay him a guinea every Saturday at noon ; in return for this Alfred was to manage Richard 's property , and pocket the profits , if any . Alfred assented : the old man chuckled at his son 's simplicity , and made him sign a formal agreement to that effect . This done he used so sit brooding and miserable nearly all the week till guinea time came ; and then brightened up a bit . One day Alfred sent for an accountant to look after his father 's papers , and see if matters were really desperate . The accountant was not long at work , and told Alfred the accounts were perfectly clear , and kept in the most , admirable order . “
320530	320534	320545	320548	an agent you want	8257	” said he , “
320554	320555	320551	320552	an accountant	14854	” “
320568	320605	320558	320558	you	8258	” Alfred was stupefied . The accountant , however , soon convinced him by the figures it was so . Alfred went with the good news to his father . His father went into a passion . “
320617	320621	320614	320615	ye fool	8260	” said he ; “
320662	320709	320649	320649	I	0	” Then Alfred saw the truth , and wondered at his past obtuseness . His father was a monomaniac . He consulted Sampson , and Sampson told him to increase the old man 's comforts on the sly , and pay him his guinea a week . “
320719	320788	320713	320713	you	8260	” Then Alfred employed an agent , and received a large income from his father 's land and houses , and another from his consols . The old gentleman had purchased westward of Hyde Park Square , and had bought with excellent judgment till his mind gave way . Alfred never spent a farthing of it on himself : but he took some for his father 's creditors . “
320794	320798	320713	320713	you	8260	” said he , “
320803	321267	321268	321268	I	0	” Some of these unhappy creditors he found in the workhouse ; the Misses Lunley that survived were there , alas ! He paid them their four thousand pounds , and restored them to society . The name of Hardie began to rise again from the dust . Now , while Richard Hardie sat brooding and miserable , expecting utter ruin , and only brightening up on guinea day , Julia had a protege with equally false views but more cheerful ones . It was an old man with a silver beard , and a machine with which he stamped leather into round pieces of silver , in his opinion . Nothing could have shaken that notion out of his mind . Julia confirmed it . She let it be known that she would always cash five pieces of round leather from Mr. Matthews ' mint per day , and ten on Friday , when working men are poorest . She contrived this with diabolical , no , angelical cunning , to save the old man from ridicule , and to do his soul much good . All souls were dear to her . What was the consequence ? He went about with his mint , and relieved poor people , and gratified his mania at the same time . His face began to beam with benevolence and innocent self - satisfaction . On Richard Hardie 's all was cordage : and deep gloom sat on his ever - knitted brow . Of these two men which was the rich man ; he who had nothing , yet thought he possessed enough for himself and his neighbours : or he who rolled in wealth , but writhed under imaginary poverty ? One reflection more . Do not look to see Providence dash the cup of prosperity from every dishonest hand ; or you will often be disappointed . Yet this , if you look closer , you shall often see : such a man holds the glittering cup tight , and nectar to the brim ; but into that cup a shadowy hand squeezes some subtle ingredient , which turns that nectar to wormwood . Richard Hardie died , his end being hastened by fear of poverty coming like an armed man , and his guinea a week going . Matthews met with an accident , and , being impervious to pain , but subject to death , was laid beside his poor mistress in St. Anne 's churchyard . Julia buried him , and had a headstone put to his grave ; and , when this was done , she took her husband to see it . On that stone was fresh carved the true name of the deceased , James Maxley . “
321276	321304	321272	321272	you	8262	” said Julia , her sweet voice trembling a little . Even she did not quite know how her husband would take it , or bear it . “
321309	321314	321305	321305	I	0	” said Alfred softly . “
321334	321361	321323	321323	I	0	” He looked at the grave in silence . Julia 's arms were round his neck in a moment , and her wet cheek consoling his . “
321384	321859	321382	321382	Jenny	401	” Richard Hardie 's papers were found in perfect order ; and among them an old will leaving 14,000l . to Edward Dodd . On this being announced to Edward , he suggested that it was a fraud : Alfred had been at him for a long time with offers of money , and failing there , and being a fine impetuous fellow , had lost his temper and forged a will , in his , Edward 's , favour . This scandalous defence broke down . The document was indisputable , and the magic sum was forced down Master Edward 's throat , nilly willy . Thus rose the Hard Cash a second time from the grave . All this enabled the tenacious Alfred to carry out a deeply - cherished design . Hardie 's late bank had been made into a shop ; but it belonged to Mrs. Dodd . He bought it of her , and set up the bank again , with Edward as managing partner . This just suited Edward , who sadly wanted employment . Hardie & Co. rose again , and soon wiped out the late disgraceful episode , and looked on to the past centuries of honour and good credit . No creditor of Richard Hardie was left unpaid . Alfred went in for politics ; stood for Barkington , was defeated by seventeen : took it as a matter of course ; told his friends he had never succeeded in anything at first ; nor been beaten in the end ; stood again , and became M. P. for Barkington , whence to dislodge him I pity any one who tries . For a long time Mrs. Dodd was nervous , and used to wake with a start at night , and put out her hand to make sure David was not lost again . But this wore off . For years the anniversary of that fatal day , when he was brought home on the stretcher , came back to them all as a day of gloom . But that wore off . Sometimes the happiness of her family seemed incredible to her , remembering what they had all gone through . At first , their troubles were too terrible and recent to be discussed . But even that wore off , and they could talk of it all ; and things bitter at the time became pleasant to remember . One midsummer day they had all dined together rather early at Albion Villa , and sat on the lawn , with Mrs. Dodd 's boy and Julia 's boy and girl playing about these ladies ' knees . Now after a little silence , Mrs. Dodd , who had been thinking quietly of many things , spoke to them all , and said : “
321897	321898	321902	321902	I	0	” “
321905	321931	321902	321902	I	0	” said Julia ; and caught up the nearest brat and kissed it impetuously : for Wifehood and Maternity had not un - Julia'd her . “
321942	321946	321940	321940	mamma	1053	” said Edward ; “
