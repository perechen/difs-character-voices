3609	3619	3621	3625	the man in the gabardine	2063	" Now , Bill , out with the bingo , "
3630	3645	3647	3648	the latter	2065	" Oh ! you 're always for the lush , you are , Dick , "
3672	3700	3744	3744	Bill	871	" But I wonder how the devil it is that Crankey Jem ai n't come yet . Who the deuce could have left that infernal door open ? "
3701	3727	3744	3744	Bill	871	" Jem or some of the other blades must have been here and left it so . It do n't matter ; it lulls suspicion . "
3728	3739	3741	3744	the man called Bill	2066	" Well , let 's make the reglars all square , "
3752	3770	3744	3744	Bill	871	" we 'll then booze a bit , and talk over this here new job of our'n . "
3771	3777	3779	3779	Dick	872	" Look alive , then , "
4358	4370	4372	4372	Bill	871	" Well , now , about this t'other job , Dick ? "
4374	4382	4372	4372	Bill	871	" It 's Jem as started it , "
4387	4421	4372	4372	Bill	871	" But he told me all about it , and so we may as well talk it over . It 's up Islington way — up there between Kentish Town and Lower Holloway . "
4422	4429	4322	4328	the two men in the next room	2084	" Who 's crib is it ? "
4430	4477	4322	4328	the two men in the next room	2084	" A swell of the name of Markham . He is an old fellow , and has two sons . One , the eldest , is with his regiment ; t'other , the youngest , is only about fifteen , or so — a mere kid . "
4478	4497	4372	4372	Bill	871	" Well , there 's no danger to be expected from him . But what about the flunkies ? "
4498	4533	4322	4328	the two men in the next room	2084	" Only two man - servants and three vimen . One of the man - servants is the old butler , too fat to do any good ; and t'other is a young tiger . "
4534	4540	4322	4328	the two men in the next room	2084	" And that 's all ? "
4541	4570	4372	4372	Bill	871	" That 's all . Now you , and I , and Jem is quite enough to crack that there crib . When is it to be done ? "
4571	4597	4322	4328	the two men in the next room	2084	" Let 's say to - morrow night ; there is no moon now to speak on , and business in other quarters is slack . "
4598	4620	4628	4628	he	2086	" So be it . Here goes , then , to the success of our new job at old Markham 's ; "
4654	4672	4372	4372	Bill	871	" I say , Bill , this old house has seen some jolly games , han't it ? "
4673	4699	4322	4328	the two men in the next room	2084	" I should think it had too . It was Jonathan Wild 's favourite crib ; and he was no fool at keeping things dark . "
4700	4741	4628	4628	he	2086	" No , surely . I dare say the well - staircase in the next room there , that 's covered over with the trap - door , has had many a dead body flung down it into the Fleet . "
4742	4766	4322	4328	the two men in the next room	2084	" Ah ! and without telling no tales too . But the trap - door has been nailed over for some years now . "
4792	4802	4628	4628	he	2086	" Why was the trap - door nailed down ? "
4803	4846	4628	4628	he	2086	" 'Cos there 's no use for that now , since the house is uninhabited , and no more travellers comes to lodge here . Besides , if we wanted to make use of such a conwenience , there 's another — — "
4865	4884	4886	4886	Dick	872	" I 've heard it said that the City is going to make great alterations in this quarter , "
4892	4907	4886	4886	Dick	872	" If so be they comes near us , we must shift our quarters . "
4908	5031	4628	4628	he	2086	" Well , and do n't we know other cribs as good as this — and just under the very nose of the authorities too ? The nearer you gets to them the safer you finds yourself . Who 'd think now that here , and in Peter - street , and on Saffron - hill too , there was such cribs as this ? Lord , how such coves as you and me does laugh when them chaps in the Common Council and the House of Commons gets on their legs and praises the blue - bottles up to the skies as the most acutest police in the world , while they wotes away the people 's money to maintain 'em ! "
5032	5066	4628	4628	he	2086	" Oh ! as for alterations , I do n't suppose there 'll be any for the next twenty years to come . They always talks of improvements long afore they begins 'em . "
5067	5128	4886	4886	Dick	872	" But when they do commence , they wo n't spare this lovely old crib ! It ' ud go to my heart to see them pull it about . I 'd much sooner take and shove a dozen stiff uns myself down the trap than see a single rafter of the place ill - treated — that I would . "
5129	5209	4628	4628	he	2086	" Ah ! if so be as the masons does come to pull its old carcass about , there 'll be some fine things made known to the world . Them cellars down stairs , in which a man might hide for fifty years and never be smelt out by the police , will turn up a bone or two , I rather suspect ; and not of a sheep , nor a pig , nor a bull neither . "
5210	5237	5239	5239	Bill	871	" Why — half the silly folks in this neighbourhood are afeerd to come here even in the daytime , because they say it 's haunted , "
5246	5308	5239	5239	Bill	871	" But , for my part , I should n't be frightened to come here at all hours of the night , and sit here alone too , even if every feller as was scragged at Tyburn or Newgate , and every one wot has been tumbled down these holes into the Fleet , was to start up , and — — "
5344	5353	5355	5356	his companion	2064	" What the devil 's the matter now ? "
5364	5376	5378	5380	the terrified ruffian	2094	" There ! there ! do n't you see — — , "
5393	5406	5408	5408	Dick	872	" It 's only some d —— d gammon of Crankey Jem , "
5421	5431	5436	5436	he	2092	" I 'll deuced soon put that to rights ! "
5452	5482	5444	5445	his comrade	2097	" No — I wo n't be left in the dark ! I ca n't bear it ! Damme , if you go , I 'll go with you ! "
6745	6774	6736	6743	those merciless villains who had borne him thither	2137	" Mercy , mercy ! I implore you ! Oh ! do not devote me to so horrible a death ! Do not — do not murder me ! "
6775	6784	6786	6786	Bill	871	" Hold your noisy tongue , you fool , "
6790	6808	6786	6786	Bill	871	" You have heard and seen too much for our safety ; we ca n't do otherwise . "
6809	6815	6817	6817	Dick	872	" No , certainly not , "
6819	6834	6817	6817	Dick	872	" You are now as fly to the fakement as any one of us . "
6835	6888	6894	6894	his	2138	" Spare me , spare me , and I will never betray you ! Oh ! do not send me out of this world , so young — so very young ! I have money , I have wealth , I am rich , and I will give you all I possess ! "
6903	6916	6918	6918	Dick	872	" Come ; here 's enough . Bill , lend a hand ! "
6937	6942	6944	6945	the youth	2012	" Mercy , mercy ! "
6954	6970	6971	6971	He	2138	" You will repent when you know — — I am not what I — — "
7070	7115	7116	7118	AN UNKNOWN FRIEND	2148	" The inscrutable decrees of Providence have enabled the undersigned to warn you , that this night a burglarious attempt will be made upon your dwelling . The wretches who contemplate this infamy are capable of a crime of much blacker die . Beware ! "
7120	7414	7116	7118	AN UNKNOWN FRIEND	2148	" This letter was written in a beautiful feminine hand . Due precaution was adopted at Mr. Markham 's mansion ; but the attempt alluded to in the warning epistle was , for some reason or another , not made . IT was between eight and nine o'clock , on a delicious evening , about a week after the events related in the preceding chapters , that two youths issued from Mr. Markham 's handsome , but somewhat secluded dwelling , in the northern part of the environs of London , and slowly ascended the adjacent hill . There was an interval of four years between the ages of these youths , the elder being upwards of nineteen , and the younger about fifteen ; but it was easy to perceive by the resemblance which existed between them that they were brothers . They walked at a short distance from each other , and exchanged not a word as they ascended the somewhat steep path which conducted them to the summit of the eminence that overlooked the mansion they had just left . The elder proceeded first ; and from time to time he clenched his fists , and knit his brows , and gave other silent but expressive indications of the angry passions which were concentrated in his breast . His brother followed him with downcast eyes , and with a countenance denoting the deep anguish that oppressed him . In this manner they arrived at the top of the hill , where they seated themselves upon a bench , which stood between two young ash saplings . For a long time the brothers remained silent ; but at length the younger of the two suddenly burst into tears , and exclaimed , "
7435	7436	7420	7420	Eugene	879	" "
7448	7454	7446	7446	Richard	874	" returned the elder brother . "
7606	7607	7608	7608	You	874	" "
7616	7636	7608	7608	You	874	" said Richard , after a pause , during which he appeared to reflect profoundly upon Eugene 's words ; "
7713	7714	7690	7690	he	2155	" "
7720	7737	7690	7690	he	2155	" repeated Eugene , with an irony which seemed extraordinary in one of his tender age ; "
7771	7772	7748	7748	he	2155	" "
7785	7799	7782	7782	he	2155	" urged Richard , whose voice was rendered almost inaudible by his sobs ; "
7813	7814	7782	7782	he	2155	" "
7824	7829	7836	7836	his	2155	" said Eugene violently ; "
7864	7865	7866	7866	I	0	" "
7878	7885	7891	7891	himself	2155	" said Richard , somewhat reproachfully , "
7907	7908	7887	7887	he	2155	" "
7917	7922	7887	7887	he	2155	" interrupted Eugene impatiently , "
8504	8505	8506	8506	I	0	" "
8513	8518	8506	8506	I	0	" said Richard mildly . "
8526	8530	8532	8533	our father	2155	" demanded Eugene . "
8537	8543	8532	8533	our father	2155	" returned the younger brother . "
8562	8566	8559	8559	their	2197	" persisted Eugene . "
8571	8575	8567	8569	My dear brother	2154	" said Richard , "
8619	8620	8621	8621	I	0	" "
8630	8636	8624	8624	you	0	" exclaimed Eugene , impatiently . "
8656	8664	8665	8665	you	2154	" he added , turning suddenly round , "
8699	8751	8752	8752	Richard	874	" And Eugene felt and looked annoyed at the turn which the conversation had taken . Richard was unhappy , and remained silent . In the meantime the sun had set ; and the darkness was gradually becoming more intense . Suddenly Eugene grasped his brother 's hand , and exclaimed , "
8759	8760	8752	8752	Richard	874	" "
8763	8771	8772	8772	you	2154	" cried the warm - hearted youth : "
8852	8853	8854	8854	I	0	" "
8863	8867	8854	8854	I	0	" returned Eugene ; "
8882	8883	8854	8854	I	0	" "
8886	8891	8892	8892	you	879	" said Richard hastily ; "
8939	8940	8925	8925	Eugene	879	" "
8950	8957	8941	8941	You	0	" said Eugene , almost contemptuously . "
9043	9044	9028	9041	a parent who has caused my ruin at my very first entrance into life	2210	" "
9063	9068	9080	9080	me	0	" ejaculated Richard fervently . "
9113	9114	9115	9115	Richard	874	" "
9133	9147	9115	9115	Richard	874	" cried Eugene emphatically , and rising from the bench as he spoke . "
9174	9175	9167	9167	I	0	" "
9180	9192	9167	9167	I	0	" murmured Richard , sobbing as if his heart would break . "
9199	9212	9213	9213	I	0	" said Eugene , slightly touched by his brother 's profound affliction . "
9242	9243	9227	9227	you	2213	" "
9255	9259	9261	9261	I	0	" said Richard . "
9265	9269	9261	9261	I	0	" answered Eugene . "
9307	9308	9309	9309	I	0	" "
9318	9813	9309	9309	I	0	" said Richard mournfully ; and , after affectionately embracing his brother , he hurried down the hill towards the mansion , turning back from time to time to catch a glimpse of Eugene 's figure through the increasing gloom , to satisfy himself that he was still there between the two saplings . Richard entered the house , and stole softly up to the bed - room which his brother usually occupied when at home . He began his mournful task of putting together the few things which Eugene had desired him to select ; and while he was thus employed the tears rolled down his cheeks in torrents . At one moment he was inclined to hurry to his father , and implore him to interfere in time to prevent Eugene 's departure ; but he remembered his solemn promise , and he would not break it . Assuredly this was a sense of honour so extreme , that it might be denominated false ; but it was , nevertheless , the sentiment which controlled all the actions of him who cherished it . Tenderly , dearly as he loved his brother — bitterly as he deplored his intended departure , he still would not forfeit his word and take the simple step which would probably have averted the much - dreaded evil . Richard 's sense of honour and inflexible integrity triumphed , on all occasions , over every other consideration , feeling , and desire ; and of this characteristic of his brother 's nature Eugene was well aware . Richard had made a small package of the articles which he had selected , and was about to leave the room to return to his brother , when the sound of a footstep in the passage communicating with the chamber , suddenly fell upon his ear . Scarcely had he time to recover from the alarm into which this circumstance had thrown him , when the door slowly opened , and the butler entered the apartment . He was a man of about fifty years of age , with a jolly red face , a somewhat bulbous nose , small laughing eyes , short grey hair standing upright in front , whiskers terminating an inch above his white cravat , and in person considerably inclined to corpulency . In height he was about five feet seven inches , and had a peculiar shuffling rapid walk , which he had learnt by some twenty - five years ' practice in little journeys from the sideboard in the dining - room to his own pantry , and back again . He was possessed of an excellent heart , and was a good - humoured companion ; but pompous , and swelling with importance in the presence of those whom he considered his inferiors . He was particularly addicted to hard words ; and as , to use his own expression , he was "
9818	9897	9309	9309	I	0	" it is not to be wondered if he occasionally gave those aforesaid hard words a pronunciation and a meaning which militated a little against received rules . In attire , he was unequalled for the whiteness of his cravat , the exuberance of his shirt - frill , the elegance of his waistcoat , the set of his kerseymere tights , and the punctilious neatness of his black silk stockings , and his well - polished shoes . "
9903	9924	9900	9901	Master Richard	874	" said the butler , as he shuffled into the room , with a white napkin under his left arm , "
9937	9938	9943	9943	Whittingham	881	" "
9945	9950	9943	9943	Whittingham	881	" replied the youth . "
9964	9965	9958	9959	my father	2156	" "
9983	10005	9974	9974	Tom	882	" said the butler , leisurely seating himself upon a chair close by the table whereon Richard had placed his package . "
10026	10027	10028	10028	Whittingham	881	" "
10048	10049	10039	10039	I	0	" "
10056	10066	10053	10054	Master Richard	874	" cried the butler , shaking his head gravely , "
10103	10116	10153	10154	Master Richard	874	" he added , slapping his right hand smartly upon his thigh ; "
10127	10128	10153	10154	Master Richard	874	" "
10132	10133	10153	10154	Master Richard	874	" "
10163	10167	10179	10181	the old man	2222	" Whittingham — — "
10168	10177	10179	10181	the old man	2222	" That 's my nomenklitter , Master Richard , "
10185	10249	10179	10181	the old man	2222	" and it was one of the fust you ever learned to pernounce . Behold ye , Master Richard , I have a right to speak — for I have knowed you both from your cradles — and loved you too ! Who was it , when you come into this subluminary spear — who was it as nussed you — and — — "
10250	10262	10179	10181	the old man	2222	" Good Whittingham , I know all that , and — — "
10263	10275	10277	10278	the butler	26635	" I have no overdue curiosity to satisfy , Master Richard , "
10280	10314	10277	10278	the butler	26635	" but my soul 's inflicted to think that you and Master Eugene could n't make a friend of old Whittingham . I feel it here , Master Richard — here , in my buzzim!"—and
10333	10353	10355	10355	Richard	874	" I must leave you now , Whittingham ; and I desire you to remain here until my return , "
10357	10364	10355	10355	Richard	874	" Do you hear , Whittingham ? "
10365	10392	10315	10318	the worthy old domestic	2224	" Yes , Master Richard ; but I do n't choose to do as you would wish in this here instance . I shall foller you . "
10393	10398	10355	10355	Richard	874	" What , Whittingham ? "
10399	10407	10355	10355	Richard	874	" I shall foller you , sir . "
10408	10416	10418	10418	Richard	874	" Well — you can do that , "
10437	10448	10423	10424	his brother	26611	" and pray God it may lead to some good . "
10449	10461	10463	10464	the butler	26635	" Ah ! now I see that I am raly wanted , "
10516	10523	10525	10527	the old domestic	2233	" Two trees , I suppose ? "
10530	10537	10539	10539	Richard	874	" Yes — he is there ! "
10541	10564	10539	10539	Richard	874	" but the reminiscence of the times when we planted those saplings has failed to induce him to abandon a desperate resolution . "
10565	10582	10584	10586	the old man	2222	" Ah ! he ai n't got Master Richard 's heart — I always knowed that , "
10594	10628	10584	10586	the old man	2222	" There are them two lads — fine tall youths — both black hair , and intelligible black eyes — admirably formed — straight as arrows — and yet so diversified in disposition ! "
10677	10686	10687	10687	he	879	" What ! Is that you , Whittingham ? "
10697	10710	10687	10687	he	879	" Richard , I did not think you would have done this . "
10711	10722	10724	10724	Whittingham	881	" It was n't Master Richard 's fault , sir , "
10726	10753	10724	10724	Whittingham	881	" I was rayther too wide awake not to smell what was a - going on by virtue of my factory nerves ; and so — — "
10754	10759	10762	10762	Eugene	879	" My dear Whittingham , "
10764	10794	10762	10762	Eugene	879	" I know that you are a faithful servant to my father , and very much attached to us : on that very account , pray do not interfere ! "
10795	10798	10800	10800	Whittingham	881	" Interfere ! "
10817	10834	10724	10724	Whittingham	881	" not interfere Master Eugene ? Well , I'm — I'm — I'm — regularly flabbergasted ! "
10835	10842	10844	10844	Eugene	879	" My mind is made up , "
10846	10889	10844	10844	Eugene	879	" and no persuasion shall alter its decision . I am my own master — my father 's conduct has emancipated me from all deference to parental authority . Richard , you have brought my things ? We must now say adieu . "
10890	10896	10724	10724	Whittingham	881	" My dearest brother — — "
10897	10902	10724	10724	Whittingham	881	" Master Eugene — — "
10903	10909	10844	10844	Eugene	879	" Whither are you going ? "
10910	10921	10724	10724	Whittingham	881	" I am on the road to fame and fortune ! "
10922	10925	10927	10927	Richard	874	" Alas ! "
10930	10949	10927	10927	Richard	874	" you may perhaps find that this world is not so fruitful in resources as you now imagine . "
10950	10959	10961	10961	Eugene	879	" All remonstrances — all objections are vain , "
10964	10975	10976	10976	he	879	" We must say adieu ! But one word more , "
10994	11100	10976	10976	he	879	" you doubt the possibility of my success in life , and I feel confident of it . Do you pursue your career under the auspices of that parent in whose wisdom you so blindly repose : I will follow mine , dependent only on mine own resources . This is the 10th of July , 1831 ; twelve years hence , on the 10th of July , 1843 , we will meet again upon this very spot , between the two trees , if they be still standing . Remember the appointment : we will then compare notes relative to our success in life ! "
11335	11339	11382	11382	he	2243	" killed the fatted calf:"—all
11897	11902	11866	11866	his	874	" out of town . "

12218	12227	12229	12230	the stranger	2298	" I see the count is abroad again , "
12241	12245	12234	12234	his	2298	" the drive . "
12246	12265	12234	12234	his	2298	" Poor fellow ! he has been playing at hide - and - seek for a long time . "
12266	12272	12274	12274	Richard	874	" Indeed ! and wherefore ? "
12276	12288	12290	12294	the well - dressed gentleman	2300	" What ! are you a stranger in London , sir ? "
12320	12336	12297	12297	his	2300	" Very nearly so , although a resident in its immediate vicinity all my life ; "
12404	12413	12415	12416	the stranger	2298	" Of course you mean to see life ? "
12418	12434	12415	12416	the stranger	2298	" Certainly . I have already studied the great world by the means of books . "
12435	12448	12574	12575	The stranger	2298	" But of course you know that there is nothing like experience . "
12449	12478	12574	12575	The stranger	2298	" I can understand how experience is necessary to a man who is anxious to make a fortune , but not to him who has already got one . "
12479	12500	12415	12416	the stranger	2298	" Oh , decidedly ! It is frequently more difficult to keep a fortune than it was to obtain one . "
12501	12510	12574	12575	The stranger	2298	" How — if I do not speculate ? "
12511	12521	12574	12575	The stranger	2298	" No ; but others will speculate upon you . "
12522	12573	12574	12575	The stranger	2298	" I really can not comprehend you . As I do not wish to increase my means , having enough , I shall neither speculate with my own nor allow people to speculate with it for me ; and thus I can run no risk of losing what I possess . "
12595	12601	12587	12587	his	2298	" You have never played ? "
12602	12609	12679	12679	he	2298	" Played ! at — — ? "
12610	12620	12587	12587	his	2298	" At cards ; for money , I mean . "
12621	12626	12587	12587	his	2298	" Oh ! never ! "
12627	12638	12640	12641	the stranger	2298	" So much the better : never do . Unless , "
12643	12674	12675	12676	The stranger	2298	" it is entirely amongst friends and men of honour . But will you avail yourself of my humble vehicle , and take one turn round ' the Drive ? ' "
12709	12731	12696	12707	a dapper - looking servant in light blue livery with silver lace	2310	" Might I have the honour of being acquainted with the name of a gentleman who exhibits so much kindness — — "
12732	12777	12778	12778	he	2298	" My dear sir , I must really apologise for my sin of omission . You confided your own circumstances so frankly to me that I can not do otherwise than show you equal confidence in return . Besides , amongst men of honour , "
12797	12903	12905	12907	the fashionable gentleman	2311	" such communications , you know , are necessary . I do not like that system of familiarity based upon no tenable grounds , which is now becoming so prevalent in London . For instance , nothing is more common than for one gentleman to meet another in Bond - street , or the Park , or in Burlington Arcade , for example 's sake , and for the one to say to the other—'My dear friend , how are you?'—'Quite well , old fellow , thank you ; but , by - the - by , I really forget your name ! ' However , "
12912	12956	12905	12907	the fashionable gentleman	2311	" here is my card . My town - quarters are Long 's Hotel , my country seat is in Berkshire , and my shooting - box is in Scotland , at all of which I shall be most happy to see you . "
13051	13094	13048	13049	Mr. Chichester	886	" Ah ! who would have thought of meeting you here — when London is actually empty , and I am ashamed of being yet left in it ? Our mutual friend the duke assured me that you were gone to Italy ! "
13095	13106	13108	13109	Mr. Chichester	886	" The duke always has some joke at my expense , "
13111	13164	13108	13109	Mr. Chichester	886	" He was once the cause of a very lovely girl committing suicide . She was the only one I ever loved ; and he one day declared in her presence that I had just embarked for America . Poor thing ! she went straight up to her room , and — — "
13165	13168	13170	13170	Richard	874	" And ! "
13172	13176	13178	13179	Mr. Chichester	886	" Took poison ! "
13199	13203	13205	13205	Markham	874	" Good heavens ! "
13207	13236	13205	13205	Markham	874	" Let me not trouble you with my private afflictions . Sir Rupert , allow me to introduce my friend Mr. Markham:—Mr . Markham , Sir Rupert Harborough . "
13248	13254	13256	13257	Sir Rupert	887	" Whither are you bound ? "
13259	13269	13256	13257	Sir Rupert	887	" We were thinking of an hour 's drive , "
13275	13305	13272	13273	Mr. Chichester	886	" and it was then my intention to have asked my friend Mr. Markham to dine with me at Long 's . Will you join us , Sir Rupert ? "
13306	13347	13205	13205	Markham	874	" Upon my honour , nothing would give me greater pleasure ; but I am engaged to meet the duke at Tattersall 's ; and I am then under a solemn promise to dine and pass the evening with Diana . "
13348	13358	13360	13361	Mr. Chichester	886	" Always gallant — always attentive to the ladies ! "
13363	13413	13360	13361	Mr. Chichester	886	" You know , my dear fellow , that Diana is so amiable , so talented , so fascinating , so accomplished , and so bewitching , that I can refuse her nothing . It is true her wants and whims are somewhat expensive at times ; but — — "
13414	13461	13205	13205	Markham	874	" Harborough , I am surprised at you ! What ! complain of the fantasies of the most beautiful woman in London — if not in England — you a man of seven thousand a year , and who at the death of an uncle — — "
13462	13471	13473	13474	Sir Rupert	887	" Upon my honour I begrudge her nothing ! "
13487	13516	13481	13481	his	887	" But , by the way , if you will honour me and Diana with your company this evening — and if Mr. Markham will also condescend — — "
13517	13522	13524	13525	Mr. Chichester	886	" With much pleasure , "
13527	13557	13524	13525	Mr. Chichester	886	" and I am sure that my friend Mr. Markham will avail himself of this opportunity of forming the acquaintance of the most beautiful and fascinating woman in England . "
13691	13701	13686	13688	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" that he must not keep the duke waiting ; "
13775	13778	13771	13771	he	874	" the duke "
13832	13843	13845	13846	Mr. Chichester	886	" What do you think of my friend the baronet ? "
13853	13856	13845	13846	Mr. Chichester	886	" the Drive "
13862	13870	13872	13872	Richard	874	" I am quite delighted with him , "
13874	13888	13872	13872	Richard	874	" and if her ladyship be only as agreeable as her husband — — "
13889	13915	13845	13846	Mr. Chichester	886	" Excuse me , but you must not call her ' her ladyship . ' Address her and speak of her simply as Mrs. Arlington . "
13916	13927	13872	13872	Richard	874	" I am really at a loss to comprehend — — "
13928	13933	13935	13935	Chichester	886	" My dear friend , "
13950	13971	13935	13935	Chichester	886	" Diana is not the wife of Sir Rupert Harborough . The baronet is unmarried ; and this lady — — "
13972	13977	13979	13979	Markham	874	" Is his mistress , "
13982	14001	13979	13979	Markham	874	" In that case I most certainly shall not accept the kind invitation I received for this evening . "
14002	14167	13935	13935	Chichester	886	" Nonsense , my dear friend ! You must adapt your behaviour to the customs of the sphere in which you move . You belong to the aristocracy — like me — and like the baronet ! In the upper class , even supposing you have a wife , she is only an encumbrance . Nothing is so characteristic of want of gentility as to marry early ; and as for children , pah ! they are the very essence of vulgarity ! Then , of course , every man of fashion in London has his mistress , even though he only keeps her for the sake of his friends . This is quite allowable amongst the aristocracy . Remember , I am not advocating the cause of immorality : I would not have every butcher , and tea - dealer , and linen - draper do the same . God forbid ! Then it would , indeed , be the height of depravity ! "
14168	14214	14216	14216	Richard	874	" Since it is the fashion , and you assure me that there is nothing wrong in this connexion between the baronet and Mrs. Arlington — at least , that the usages of high life admit it — I will not advance any farther scruples , "
15310	15321	15323	15323	Chichester	886	" Well , what shall we do to amuse ourselves ? "
15341	15346	15348	15349	the baronet	26709	" Upon my honour , "
15351	15368	15348	15349	the baronet	26709	" I am perfectly indifferent . What say you to a game of whist or écarté ? "
15369	15375	15377	15377	Chichester	886	" Just as you choose , "
15462	15472	15473	15473	he	2363	" Holloa , old chap , how are you ? "
15483	15499	15473	15473	he	2363	" Harborough , how are you ? Chichester , my tulip , how goes it ? "
15570	15641	15558	15558	Chichester	886	" Talbot is an excellent fellow — a regular John Bull — not over polished , but enormously rich and well connected . You will see that he is not more cultivated in mind than in manners ; but he would go to the devil to do any one a service ; and , somehow or another , you ca n't help liking the fellow when once you know him . "
15642	15658	15660	15660	Richard	874	" Any friend of yours or of the baronet 's will be agreeable to me , "
15662	15683	15660	15660	Richard	874	" and , provided he is a man of honour , a little roughness of manner should be readily overlooked . "
15684	15702	15704	15705	Mr. Chichester	886	" You speak like a man of the world , and as a man of honour yourself , "
15734	15747	15749	15750	Mr. Chichester	886	" I did n't know that you were in town , Talbot , "
15752	15760	15762	15763	the baronet	26709	" And I forgot to mention it , "
15765	15769	15771	15772	the lady	2373	" Or rather , "
15774	15786	15771	15772	the lady	2373	" you meditated a little surprise for your friend Mr. Chichester . "
15787	15810	15812	15813	Mr. Talbot	894	" I hope you 've been well , ma'am , since I saw you last — that is the day before yesterday , "
15815	15840	15812	15813	Mr. Talbot	894	" You was complaining then of a slight cold , and I recommended a treacle - posset and a stocking tied round the throat . "
15841	15850	15852	15853	the baronet	26709	" My dear Talbot , take some liqueur , "
15874	15888	15890	15891	Mr. Talbot	894	" But I dare say you did n't follow my advice , ma'am , "
15899	15982	15812	15813	Mr. Talbot	894	" For my part I am suffering dreadful with a bad foot . I 'll tell you how it were , ma'am . I 've got a nasty soft corn on my little toe ; and so what must I do , but yesterday morning I takes my razor , sharpens it upon the paytent strap , and goes for to cut off master corn . But instead of cutting the corn , I nearly sliced my toe off ; and — — "
15983	16007	16009	16010	the baronet	26709	" By the way , Diana , has the young gentleman called yet , whom we met the other evening at the Opera ? "
16018	16032	16034	16035	the Enchantress	2342	" Do you mean the effeminate youth whom we dubbed the Handsome Unknown ? "
16037	16058	16034	16035	the Enchantress	2342	" Yes : he who was so very mysterious , but who seemed so excessively anxious to form our acquaintance . "
16059	16069	16071	16071	Diana	889	" He promised to call some evening this week , "
16073	16091	16071	16071	Diana	889	" and play a game of écarté . He told me that he was invincible at écarté . "
16092	16103	16105	16106	Mr. Chichester	886	" Talking of écarté , let us play a game , "
16122	16133	16135	16136	this individual	2292	" Well , I 'll take a hand with pleasure , "
16146	16165	16143	16143	he	2292	" I will tell you the rest of the adventure about the soft corn another time , ma'am . "
16166	16173	16175	16175	Chichester	886	" What a nuisance this is ! "
16180	16188	16175	16175	Chichester	886	" The young fellow does stare so . "
16189	16199	16202	16203	the baronet	26709	" You must give him some explanation or another , "
16205	16221	16202	16203	the baronet	26709	" or I 'll tell Diana to say something presently that will smooth down matters . "
16272	16279	16260	16261	the lady	2373	" Are you fond of écarté ? "
16280	16317	16260	16261	the lady	2373	" I must venture a guinea upon Mr. Chichester . Sir Rupert is betting against him ; and I love to oppose Sir Rupert at cards . You will see how I shall tease him presently . "
16458	16472	16474	16475	Mr. Talbot	894	" Would you , ma'am , like to take Mr. Chichester 's place ? "
16722	16730	16732	16733	Mrs. Arlington	891	" Mr. Sydney , you are welcome , "
16745	16772	16732	16733	Mrs. Arlington	891	" It was but an hour ago that we were talking of you , and wondering why we had not received the pleasure of a visit . "
16773	16781	16783	16784	Mr. Sydney	897	" Madam , you are too kind , "
16807	16841	16842	16842	He	2392	" I am afraid that I am intruding : I had hoped to find you alone — I mean yourself and Sir Rupert Harborough — and I perceive that you have company — — "
17350	17361	17368	17369	Mr. Talbot	894	" Fal de lal lal , fal de lal la . "
17422	17427	17429	17430	Mr. Chichester	886	" What a pity , "
17457	17492	17447	17447	he	886	" this is his only fault — and , as it happens every night , it begins materially to disfigure his character . Otherwise , he is an excellent fellow , and immensely rich ! "
17600	17607	17598	17598	he	897	" that they should meet again , "
18942	18948	18950	18951	the servant	2459	" Mr. Stephens is below , "
18953	18972	18950	18951	the servant	2459	" I told him you had not risen yet , and he says he will await your convenience . "
18973	18981	18983	18984	the lady	2373	" I know not how it is , "
18987	19010	19011	19011	she	2373	" but I never felt less disposed for the visit of him whom I regard as my benefactor . Ah ! Louisa , "
19021	19056	19011	19011	she	2373	" I feel as if one of those dreadful attacks of despondency — one of those fearful fits of alarm and foreboding — of presentiment of evil , were coming on ; and — — "
19057	19062	19064	19065	the servant	2459	" Pray calm yourself , "
19075	19113	19064	19065	the servant	2459	" Remember that the very walls have ears ; that a word spoken in too high a tone may betray your secret ; and heaven alone knows what would be the result of such an appalling discovery ! "
19114	19123	19125	19126	the lady	2373	" Yes , it is that horrible mystery , "
19128	19205	19125	19126	the lady	2373	" which fills me with the most acute apprehensions . Compelled to sustain a constant cheat — to feel that I am a living , a breathing , a moving falsehood , a walking lie;—forced to crush all the natural amenities — ay , and even the amiable weaknesses of my sex ; governed by an imperious necessity against which it is now impossible to rebel,—how can I do otherwise than experience moments of unutterable anguish ! "
19206	19257	19064	19065	the servant	2459	" You must still have patience — patience only for a few months — three short months,—and the result of all this suspense — the end of all this anxiety , will be no doubt as advantageous — as immensely important and beneficial — as we are led to believe . "
19258	19281	19283	19284	the lady	2373	" True : we are bound to believe a man who seems so serious in all his actions with regard to me , "
19304	19344	19293	19293	she	2373	" But why does he keep me in the dark with regard to the true nature of that grand result ? Why does he not trust me , who have placed such unbounded , such implicit confidence in him ? "
19345	19373	19375	19376	the domestic	2464	" He is afraid lest an unguarded moment on your part should betray what he assures us to be of the most vital — the last importance , "
19384	19392	19393	19393	she	2373	" And really , my dearest girl , "
19396	19404	19393	19393	she	2373	affectionately,—"pardon me for calling you so — — "
19405	19416	19418	19419	the lady	2373	" Ah ! Louisa , you are my dearest friend ! "
19422	19452	19418	19419	the lady	2373	" You , and you alone , have supported my courage during the four years and a half that this horrible deceit has already lasted ; your kindness — — "
19453	19468	19471	19473	the female dependant	2466	" I have only done my duty , and acted as my heart dictated , "
19475	19513	19471	19473	the female dependant	2466	" But as I was observing , you are so very imprudent , as it is ; and can you expect that Mr. Stephens will reveal to you the minute details of a scheme , which — — "
19514	19517	19520	19521	the lady	2373	" Imprudent ! "
19523	19675	19520	19521	the lady	2373	" how am I imprudent ? Do I not follow all his directions — all your advice ? Have I not even learned to talk to the very groom in his own language about the horses and the dogs ? and do I not scamper across the country , upon my chestnut mare , with him following upon the bay horse at my heels , as if we were both mad ? And then you say that I am imprudent , when I have done all I can to sustain the character which I have assumed ? And with the exception of these rides , how seldom do I go abroad ? Half - a - dozen names include all my acquaintances : and no one — no one ever comes here ! This is , indeed , a hermit 's dwelling ! How can you say that I am imprudent ? "
19676	19685	19687	19687	Louisa	900	" Without going out of this very room , "
19693	19698	19687	19687	Louisa	900	" I could — — "
19699	19712	19714	19715	the lady	2373	" Ah ! the eternal remonstrances against these habiliments of my sex ! "
19746	19993	19714	19715	the lady	2373	" ever those remonstrances ! Alas ! I should die — I could not support this appalling deceit — were I not to gratify my woman 's feelings from time to time ? Do you think that I can altogether rebel against nature , and not experience the effects ? And , in occasionally soothing my mind with the occupations natural to my sex , have I ever been imprudent ? When I have dressed my hair as it should ever be dressed — when I have put on one of those silk or muslin robes , merely to see myself reflected in my mirror — and , oh ! what a pardonable vanity under such circumstances!—have I ever been imprudent enough to set foot outside this retreat — this boudoir , to which you alone are ever admitted ? Do I ever dress with the blinds of the windows raised ? No : I have done all that human being can do to support my spirits during this sad trial , and sustain the character I have assumed . But if it be desired that I should altogether forget my sex — and cling to the garb of a man ; if I may never — not even for an hour in the evening — follow my fantasy , and relieve my mind by resuming the garb which is natural to me — within these four walls — unseen by a soul save you — — "
19994	20005	20007	20007	Louisa	900	" Yes , yes , you shall have your way , "
20010	20024	20007	20007	Louisa	900	" But Mr. Stephens waits : will you not rise and see him ? "
20025	20031	20033	20034	the lady	2373	" It is my duty , "
20037	20077	20033	20034	the lady	2373	" He has surrounded me with every comfort and every luxury which appetite can desire or money procure ; and , however he may ultimately benefit by this proceeding , in the meantime my gratitude is due to him . "
20078	20090	20092	20092	Louisa	900	" The delicacy of his conduct towards you equals his liberality , "
20095	20142	20092	20092	Louisa	900	" Yes ; notwithstanding the peculiarity of our relative position , not a word , not a look disrespectful towards me from the first moment of our acquaintance ! He faithfully adheres to his portion of the contract , and I will as religiously observe mine . "
20143	20150	20152	20152	Louisa	900	" You speak wisely and consistently , "
20154	20179	20152	20152	Louisa	900	" and the result of your honourable conduct towards Mr. Stephens will no doubt be a recompense which will establish your fortunes for life . "
20180	20381	20382	20383	The lady	2373	" That hope sustains me . Oh ! how happy , thrice happy shall I be , when , the period of my emancipation being arrived , I may escape to some distant part of my own native country , or to some foreign clime , resume the garb belonging to my sex , and live in a way consistent with nature , and suitable to my taste . It is in anticipation of those golden moments that I from time to time retire into the impenetrable mystery of this boudoir , and dress myself in the garb which I love , and which is my own . And when that elysian age shall come , oh ! how shall I divert my mind with a retrospection upon these long weary weeks and months , during which I have been compelled to study habits opposed to my taste and feeling — to affect a love of horses and dogs , that a manly predilection may avert attention from a feminine countenance,—and to measure each word that falls from my lips , to study each attitude which my form assumes , and to relinquish pursuits and occupations which my mind adores . "
20415	20425	20411	20411	she	900	" keeping Mr. Stephens waiting rather longer than usual ; "
21149	21154	21155	21155	he	899	" My dear Walter , "
21158	21203	21155	21155	he	899	" it is really an age since I have seen you . Six weeks have elapsed , and I have not been near you . But you received my letter , stating that I was compelled to proceed to Paris upon most particular business ? "
21204	21211	21213	21214	the lady,—or	2499	" Yes , my dear sir , "
21247	21305	21307	21307	Walter	897	known,—"yes , my dear sir , I received your letter , and the handsome presents and remittances accompanying it . For each and all I return you my sincere thanks : but really , with regard to money , you are far too lavish towards me . Remember that I scarcely have any opportunity of being extravagant , "
21313	21347	21307	21307	Walter	897	" for I scarcely ever stir abroad , save to take my daily rides ; and you know that I never receive company , that my acquaintances are limited , so limited — — "
21348	21368	21370	21371	Mr. Stephens	899	" I know , my dear Walter , that you follow my advice as closely as can be expected , "
21373	21428	21370	21371	Mr. Stephens	899	" Three short months more and my object will be achieved . We shall then be both of us above the reach of Fortune 's caprices and vicissitudes . Oh ! how glorious — how grand will be this achievement ! how well worth all the sacrifices that I have required you to make . "
21429	21436	21438	21438	Walter	897	" Ah ! my dear sir , "
21443	21477	21438	21438	Walter	897	" you must remember that you are now talking enigmas to me ; that I am at present only a blind instrument in your hands — a mere machine — an automaton — — "
21478	21489	21491	21492	Mr. Stephens	899	" Do not press me upon this head , Walter , "
21496	21661	21681	21681	Walter	897	" You must not as yet be led to comprehend the magnitude of my views : you must have patience . Surely I have given you ample proofs of my good feeling and my honourable views towards yourself . Only conceive what would be your present position without me ; not a relation , not a friend in the wide world to aid or protect you ! I do not say this to vaunt my own conduct : I am merely advancing arguments to prove how confident I am in the success of my plans , and how sincere I am in my friendship towards you . For , remember , Walter — I always forget your sex : I only look upon you as a mere boy — a nephew , or a son , whom I love . Such is my feeling : I am more than a friend ; for , I repeat , I feel a paternal attachment towards you ! "
21662	21679	21681	21681	Walter	897	" And I entertain feelings of deep — yes , of the deepest gratitude towards you , "
21683	21776	21681	21681	Walter	897	" But the motive of my constant intercession to be admitted more into your confidence , is to be convinced — by my own knowledge — that my present conduct tends to facilitate no dishonest , no dangerous views . Oh ! you will pardon me when I say this ; for there are times when I am a prey to the most horrible alarms — when fears of an indescribable nature haunt me for hours together — and when I seem to be walking blindfold upon the brink of an abyss ! "
21777	21797	21799	21800	Mr. Stephens	899	" Walter , I am surprised that you should thus give way to suspicions most injurious to my honour , "
21810	21826	21799	21800	Mr. Stephens	899	" for the hundredth time do I assure you that you have nothing to fear . "
21827	21847	21849	21849	Walter	897	" Then wherefore this disguise ? why this constant cheat relative to my sex ? why this permanent deception ? "
21856	21876	21878	21879	Mr. Stephens	899	" Can not the most rigorous honesty be connected with the most profound prudence — the most delicate caution ? "
21889	21927	21681	21681	Walter	897	" Do not judge of motives by their mere superficial aspect : strange devices — but not the less honourable for being singular — are frequently required in the world to defeat designs of infamy and baseness . "
21928	21933	21935	21935	Walter	897	" Pardon my scepticism , "
21943	21989	21935	21935	Walter	897	" I was wrong , very wrong to suspect you . I will not again urge my anxiety to penetrate your secrets . I feel persuaded that you conceal the means by which our mutual prosperity is to be effected , simply for my good . "
21990	22005	22007	22008	Mr. Stephens	899	" Now you speak rationally , my dear , my faithful and confiding Walter , "
22010	22036	22007	22008	Mr. Stephens	899	" It was just in this vein that I was anxious to find you ; for I have an important communication to make this morning . "
22037	22050	21935	21935	Walter	897	" Speak : I am ready to follow your instructions or advice . "
22051	22159	21935	21935	Walter	897	" I must inform you , Walter , that in order effectually to work out my plans — in order that there should not exist the slightest chance of failure — a third person is required . It will be necessary that he should be conversant with our secret : he must know all ; and , of course , he must be taken care of hereafter . To be brief , I have already fallen in with the very individual who will suit me ; and I have acquainted him with the entire matter . You will not object to receive him occasionally as a guest ? "
22160	22195	22007	22008	Mr. Stephens	899	" My dear sir , how can I object ? Is not this your house ? and am not I in your hands ? You know that you can command me in all respects . "
22196	22212	22214	22215	Mr. Stephens	899	" I thought that you would meet my views with this readiness and good will , "
22217	22243	22214	22215	Mr. Stephens	899	" To tell you the real truth , then — I have taken the liberty of inviting him to dine with us here this day . "
22244	22249	22007	22008	Mr. Stephens	899	" To - day ! "
22250	22257	21935	21935	Walter	897	" Yes . Are you annoyed ? "
22258	22271	22007	22008	Mr. Stephens	899	" Oh ! not at all : only , the preparations — — "
22272	22342	22007	22008	Mr. Stephens	899	" Do not alarm yourself . While you were occupied with your toilet , I gave the necessary instructions to the cook . The old woman is almost blind and deaf , still she knows full well how to serve up a tempting repast ; and as I am believed by your three servants to be your guardian , my interference in this respect will not have appeared strange . "
22343	22350	22352	22352	Walter	897	" How could they think otherwise ? "
22354	22444	22352	22352	Walter	897	" Did not you provide those dependants who surround me ? Do they not look upon you as their master as well as myself ? Are they not aware that the villa is your own property ? And have they not been led to believe — with the exception of Louisa , who alone of the three knows the secret — that the state of my health compelled you to place me here for the benefit of a purer air than that which your residence in the city affords ? "
22445	22456	22458	22459	Mr. Stephens	899	" Well , since my arrangements meet with your satisfaction , "
22463	22506	22508	22509	Mr. Stephens	899	" I am satisfied . But I should tell you that I invited my friend hither not only to dine , but also to pass the day , that we might have an opportunity of conversing together at our leisure . Indeed , "
22516	22524	22508	22509	Mr. Stephens	899	" I expect him here every moment . "
22552	22556	22547	22547	Louisa	900	" Mr. Montague . "
22856	22861	22855	22859	a " devilish good fellow	26825	" devilish good fellow ; "
22959	22965	22967	22967	they	2511	" young men about town : "
22972	22978	22970	22970	they	2511	" men upon the town . "
23150	23153	23102	23106	the men upon the town	2529	" so vulgar "
23216	23220	23203	23205	Mr. George Montague	903	" City men , "
23249	23256	23243	23243	their	1993	" the front of the Bank , "
23257	23264	23275	23276	City men	26832	" the Custom - house Wharf , "
23266	23274	23243	23243	their	1993	" under the clock at the Docks . "
23285	23306	23307	23307	they	26832	" a certain speculation that would make a sure fortune , if one had but the capital to work upon ; "
23392	23396	23343	23343	they	26832	" making a hit "
23441	23462	23436	23437	each other	2546	" that it never could have been done unless he 'd had somebody with plenty of money to back him . "
23540	23549	23552	23552	his	903	" that money was necessary to beget money ; "
23553	23557	23559	23559	he	903	" City career , "
23842	23853	23839	23839	he	903	" an excellent thing in hand just at that moment ; "
23933	23943	23930	23931	Mr. Stephens	899	" if there were anything new in the City ? "
23944	23948	23950	23950	Montague	903	" Nothing particular , "
23952	24020	24026	24026	Stephens	899	" I have not of course been in town this morning ; but I was not away till late last night . I had a splendid thing in hand , which I succeeded in bringing to a favourable termination . By - the - by , there was a rumour on ' Change yesterday afternoon , just before the close , that Alderman Dumkins is all wrong . "
24021	24024	24026	24026	Stephens	899	" Indeed , "
24028	24035	24026	24026	Stephens	899	" I thought he was wealthy . "
24036	24071	24026	24026	Stephens	899	" Oh ! no ; I knew the contrary eighteen months ago ! It appears he has been starting a joint - stock company to work the Ercalat tin - mines in Cornwall — — "
24072	24083	24026	24026	Stephens	899	" And I suppose the mines do not really exist ? "
24084	24135	24026	24026	Stephens	899	" Oh ! yes ; they do — upon his maps ! However , he has been exhibiting certain specimens of tin , which he has passed off as Ercalat produce ; and it is now pretty generally known that the article was supplied him by a house in Aldgate . "
24136	24147	24026	24026	Stephens	899	" Then he will be compelled to resign his gown ? "
24148	24307	24026	24026	Stephens	899	" Not he ! On the contrary , he stands next in rotation for the honours of the civic chair ; and he intends to go boldly forward as if nothing had happened . You must remember that the aldermen of the City of London have degenerated considerably in respectability during late years ; and that none of the really influential and wealthy men in the City will have anything to do with the corporation affairs . You do not see any great banker nor merchant wearing the aldermanic gown . The only alderman who really possessed what may be called a large fortune , and whose pecuniary position was above all doubt , resigned his gown the other day in disgust at the treatment which he received from his brother authorities , in consequence of his connexion with the Weekly Courier — the only newspaper that boldly , fearlessly , and effectually advocates the people 's cause . "
24308	24318	24026	24026	Stephens	899	" And Dumkins will not resign , you think ? "
24319	24330	24332	24332	Montague	903	" Oh ! decidedly not . But for my part , "
24334	24413	24332	24332	Montague	903	" I feel convinced that the sooner some change is made in the City administration the better . Only conceive the immense sums which the corporation receives from various sources , and the uses to which they are applied . Look at the beastly guzzling at Guildhall , while there are in the very heart of the City Augean stables of filth , crime , and debauchery to be cleansed — witness Petticoat - lane , Smithfield — — "
24456	24463	24465	24465	Stephens	899	" Compose yourself , compose yourself , "
24469	24486	24465	24465	Stephens	899	" Shall I ring for a glass of water , or wine , or anything — — "
24487	24494	24496	24497	Walter Sydney	897	" No , it is past , "
24499	24529	24496	24497	Walter Sydney	897	" but I never think of that horrible — that appalling adventure without feeling my blood curdle in my veins . The mere mention of the word Smithfield — — "
24530	24546	24548	24548	Montague	903	" Could I have been indiscreet enough to give utterance to anything calculated to annoy ? "
24557	24574	24576	24576	Walter	897	" You were not aware of the reminiscence you awoke in my mind by your remark , "
24580	24600	24576	24576	Walter	897	" but were you acquainted with the particulars of that fearful night , you would readily excuse my weakness . "
24601	24610	24612	24612	Stephens	899	" You have excited Mr. Montague 's curiosity , "
24614	24627	24612	24612	Stephens	899	" and you have now nothing to do but to gratify it . "
24628	24659	24576	24576	Walter	897	" It is an adventure of a most romantic kind — an adventure which you will scarcely believe — and yet one that will make your hair stand on end . "
24660	24675	24677	24677	Montague	903	" I am now most anxious to learn the details of this mysterious occurrence , "
24712	25090	24691	24692	Walter Sydney	897	" It is now a little more than four years ago — very shortly after I first arrived at this house — that I rode into town , attended by the same groom who is in my service now . I knew little or nothing of the City , and felt my curiosity awakened to view the emporium of the world 's commerce . I accordingly determined to indulge in a ramble by myself amidst the streets and thoroughfares of a place of which such marvellous accounts reach those who pass their youth in the country . I left the groom with the horses at a livery - stable in Bishopsgate - street , with a promise to return in the course of two or three hours . I then roved about to my heart 's content , and never gave the lapse of time a thought . Evening came , and the weather grew threatening . Then commenced my perplexities . I had forgotten the address of the stables where the groom awaited my return ; and I discovered the pleasing fact that I had lost my way just at the moment when an awful storm seemed ready to break over the metropolis . When I solicited information concerning the right path which I should pursue , I was insulted by the low churls to whom I applied . To be brief , I was overtaken by darkness and by the storm , in a place which I have since ascertained to be Smithfield market . I could not have conceived that so filthy and horrible a nuisance could have been allowed to exist in the midst of a city of so much wealth . But , oh ! the revolting streets which branch off from that Smithfield . It seemed to me that I was wandering amongst all the haunts of crime and appalling penury of which I had read in romances , but which I never could have believed to exist in the very heart of the metropolis of the world . Civilisation appeared to me to have chosen particular places which it condescended to visit , and to have passed others by without even leaving a foot - print to denote its presence . "
25091	25097	25099	25099	Montague	903	" But this horrible adventure ? "
25101	25248	25099	25099	Montague	903	" Oh ! forgive my digression . Surrounded by darkness , exposed to the rage of the storm , and actually sinking with fatigue , I took refuge in an old house , which I am sure I could never find again ; but which was situated nearly at the end , and on the right - hand side of the way , of one of those vile narrow streets branching off from Smithfield . That house was the den of wild beasts in human shape ! I was compelled to hear a conversation of a most appalling nature between two ruffians , who made that place the depôt for their plunder . They planned , amongst other atrocious topics , the robbery of a country - seat , somewhere to the north of Islington , and inhabited by a family of the name of Markham . "
25249	25257	25265	25265	he	903	" Indeed ! What — how strange ! "
25268	25281	25265	25265	he	903	" How singular that you should have overheard so vile a scheme ! "
25282	25288	25290	25290	Walter	897	" Oh ! those villains , "
25292	25354	25290	25290	Walter	897	" were capable of crimes of a far deeper dye ! They discussed horror upon horror , till I thought that I was going raving mad . I made a desperate attempt to escape , and was perceived . What then immediately followed I know not , for I became insensible : in a word , Mr. Montague , I fainted ! "
25414	25424	25425	25425	she	2571	" I awoke to encounter a scene of horror , "
25433	25519	25520	25520	she	2571	" which you must fancy ; but the full extent of which I can not depict . I can only feel it even now . Those wretches were conveying me to a room upon the ground - floor — a room to which the cells of the Bastille or the Inquisition could have produced no equal . It had a trap - door communicating with the Fleet Ditch ! I begged for mercy — I promised wealth — for I knew that my kind benefactor , "
25528	25557	25520	25520	she	2571	" would have enabled me to fulfil my pledge to them ; but all was in vain . The murderers hurled me down the dark and pestiferous hole ! "
25558	25562	25564	25564	Montague	903	" Merciful heavens ! "
25566	25576	25578	25578	Walter	897	" It would appear that the house in question , "
25580	25843	25578	25578	Walter	897	" stood upon the side of , and not over the Ditch . There can be , however , no doubt that the trap - door was contrived for the horrible purpose of disposing of those victims who fell into the merciless hands of the occupants of the dwelling ; for when I had fallen some distance , instead of being immersed in black and filthy mud , I was caught upon a sloping plank which shelved towards a large aperture in the wall of the Ditch . I instinctively clung to this plank , and lay stretched upon it for some moments until I had partially recovered my presence of mind . The circumstance of having thus escaped a dreadful death gave me an amount of courage at which I myself was astonished . At length I began to reason whether it would be better to remain there until morning , and then endeavour to reach the trap - door above my head , or to devise some means of immediate escape . I decided upon the latter proceeding ; for I reflected that the morning would not afford light to that subterranean hole to enable me to act with certainty ; and I , moreover , dreaded the extreme vengeance of those ruffians who had already given me a sample of their brutality , should I happen to encounter them on emerging from the trap - door . Lastly , I considered that it was also probable that I might not succeed in raising the trap - door at all . "
25844	25850	25852	25852	Montague	903	" What a fearful situation ! "
25854	25861	25863	25863	Stephens	899	" Horrible even to think of , "
25885	25895	25897	25897	Walter	897	" With my hands and legs I groped about , "
25899	26313	25897	25897	Walter	897	" and I speedily ascertained my exact position with regard to the locality . My feet were close to a large square aperture in the perpendicular wall overhanging the Ditch ; and the floor of the cellar was only a couple of feet below the aperture . I accordingly got cautiously off the board , and stood upon the damp ground . After the lapse of several minutes , during which I nerved myself to adopt the idea that had struck me , I passed my head through the aperture , and looked out over the Ditch . The stream appeared rapid , to judge by its gurgling sound ; and the stench that exhaled from it was pestiferous in the extreme . Turning my head to the left I saw hundreds of lights twinkling in the small narrow windows of two lines of houses that overhung the Ditch . The storm had now completely passed away — the rain had ceased — and the night was clear and beautiful . In a few minutes I was perfectly acquainted with the entire geography of the place . The means of escape were within my reach . About three feet above the aperture through which I was now looking , a plank crossed the Ditch ; and on the opposite side — for the Ditch in that part was not above two yards wide from wall to wall — was a narrow ledge running along the side of the house facing the one in which I was , and evidently communicating with some lane or street close by . I can scarcely tell you how I contrived to creep through the aperture and reach the plank overhead . Nevertheless , I attempted the dangerous feat , and I accomplished it . I crossed the plank , and reached the ledge of which I have spoken : it terminated in the very street where stood the terrible den from which I had just so miraculously escaped . Indeed , I emerged upon that street only at a distance of a few yards from the door of that detestable place . To hurry away in a contrary direction was my first and most natural impulse ; but I had not proceeded far when the door of a house was suddenly thrown violently open , and out poured a crowd of men and women , among whom I was , as it were , immediately hemmed in . "
26314	26320	26322	26322	Montague	903	" What ! another adventure ? "
26324	26339	26341	26341	Walter	897	" One calculated to inspire feelings of deep disgust , if not of alarm , "
26343	26475	26341	26341	Walter	897	" It appeared that two women had been quarreling and had turned out to fight . They fell upon each other like wild cats , or as you would fancy that tigers would fight . A clear and lovely moon lighted this revolting scene . A circle was formed round the termagants , and for ten minutes did they lacerate themselves with fists and nails in a fearful manner . Their clothes were torn into ribands — their countenances were horribly disfigured with scratches — the blood poured from their noses — and their hair , hanging all dishevelled over their naked shoulders , gave them a wild , ferocious , and savage appearance , such as I never could have expected to encounter in the metropolis of the civilised world . "
26476	26486	26488	26489	Mr. Montague	903	" And in the very heart of the City , "
26491	27225	26488	26489	Mr. Montague	903	" Suddenly a cry of ' The Bluebottles ! ' was raised , and the crowd , belligerents and all , rushed pell - mell back again into the house . In spite of all my endeavours to escape I was hurried in with that hideous mob of ferocious - looking men and brazen - faced women . In a few moments I found myself in a large room , in which there were at least thirty wretched beds huddled close together , and so revoltingly dirty that the cold pavement or a hedge - side would have seemed a more preferable couch . And , oh ! how can I describe the inmates of that den , many of whom were crowding round a fire cooking provender , which filled the place with a sickening and most fetid odour . There were young girls almost naked , without shoes or stockings , and whose sunken checks , dimmed eyes , and miserable attire contrasted strangely with their boisterous mirth . Some of these unfortunate creatures , nevertheless , retained traces of original beauty prematurely faded . The men were hatless and shoeless ; indeed the entire assembly consisted of males and females evidently of the most wretched description . Scarcely had I time to cast a glance around me when I was questioned as to how I came there ? what I wanted ? and whether I meant to stand anything ? ' I will tell you what it is , ' said one to his companions , ' he is a swell who is come to have a look at these kind of cribs , and he must pay his footing . ' I immediately comprehended the nature of the impression which my presence had created , and presented the individual who had spoken with a couple of half - crowns . The sight of the money produced an immense feeling in my favour . Heaven only knows how many gallons of beer were fetched from a neighbouring public - house ; and when the inmates of that lazar - house — for I can scarcely call it anything else — had all partaken of the liquor , I was overwhelmed with offers of service . One declared , that if I merely came to see the neighbourhood he would take me round to every place in the street ; another assured me , that if I had committed a forgery or any other ' genteel crime , ' he would either help me to lie secure until the matter had blown over , or to escape from the country ; and so on . I suffered the wretches to retain the impression that curiosity had alone led me thither ; and as soon as I had made this announcement the mistress of the house was summoned to do the honours of the establishment . A blear - eyed old crone made her appearance , and insisted upon showing me over the house . ' These rooms , ' said she , meaning the two upon the ground floor , ' are for those who can afford to pay threepence for their bed and who have supper to cook . ' We then ascended to the first floor . ' These are the four - penny beds , ' said the old woman , pointing with pride and satisfaction to some thirty or forty couches , a shade cleaner , and the least thing further off from each other than those down stairs . The rooms on the first floor were also filled with lodgers ; and another demand was made upon my purse . On the third floor and in the attics were the most horrible scenes of wretchedness which I had yet beheld . Those dens were filled with straw beds , separated from each other only by pieces of plank about eight or ten inches in height . Men , women , and children were all crowded together — sleeping pell - mell . Oh ! it was a horrible , horrible spectacle . To be brief , I escaped from that moral plague - house ; and in a few moments was traversing Smithfield once more . Even the tainted air of that filthy enclosure was refreshing after the foul atmosphere from which I had just emerged . "
27243	27268	27270	27270	Montague	903	" And you never took any steps to root out that nest of villains in the Old House whence you escaped alive so miraculously ? "
27281	27292	27294	27294	Walter	897	" I wrote two anonymous letters the very next morning , "
27296	27332	27294	27294	Walter	897	" one to Mr. Markham , warning him of the contemplated burglar at his house ; and another to the Lord Mayor of London . It did not altogether suit Mr. Stephens 's plans — — "
27333	27356	27358	27359	this gentleman	2368	" No — not to make a fuss about an affair which would have been sure to bring your name into notoriety , "
27362	27376	27378	27378	Montague	903	" That adventure has no doubt given you a distaste for late rambles , "
27380	27388	27378	27378	Montague	903	" In the City — decidedly so , "
27393	27470	27378	27378	Montague	903	" I seldom go into London , early or late — I have so few inducements — so few acquaintances ! By the way , a few evenings ago I treated myself to a visit to the Opera , and there accident threw me into conversation with a gentleman and lady who sat in the same box as myself . The result was an invitation to the abode of the lady — a Mrs. Arlington — — "
27471	27475	27477	27477	Montague	903	" Mrs. Arlington , "
27486	27644	27477	27477	Montague	903	" The same . She is the friend of Sir Rupert Harborough . I am anxious to see something of the world now and then — and to avail myself of my present garb for that purpose . I accordingly called upon Mrs. Arlington last evening , and learnt ' a lesson of life . ' I saw an elegant woman , a baronet , a fashionable gentleman , and a very interesting young man , associating with a vulgar wretch of the name , I believe , of Talbot , whose manners would have disgraced a groom . I must , however , observe that the interesting young gentleman to whom I allude did not seem to be more pleased with the conversation and conduct of this vulgarian than myself . One coincidence somewhat extraordinary occurred — that same interesting young man was no other than Mr. Richard Markham , one of the sons of — — "
27645	27653	27655	27656	George Montague	903	" Ah ! indeed — how singular ! "
27666	27670	27671	27671	he	897	" very singular ! "
28002	28020	27992	27992	Richard	874	" I am always thinking of the period when I must bid adieu to your charming society . "
28021	28025	28027	28027	Diana	889	" Bid adieu ! "
28029	28033	28027	28027	Diana	889	" and wherefore ? "
28034	28053	28099	28099	she	889	" It must happen , sooner or later , that our ways in the world will be different . "
28054	28063	28065	28065	Diana	889	" Then you are not your own master ? "
28069	28084	28065	28065	Diana	889	" Certainly I am . But all friends must part some time or another . "
28085	28088	28090	28090	Diana	889	" True , "
28102	28132	28099	28099	she	889	" There are certain persons who are attracted towards each other by kindred feelings and emotions , and it is painful — very painful , for them to part ! "
28133	28138	28099	28099	she	889	" Heavens , Diana ! "
28142	28149	28150	28150	She	889	" you feel as I do ! "
28210	28217	28176	28176	she	889	" You feel as I do , "
28325	28338	28351	28351	her	889	" Why do you weep , Diana ? why do you weep ? "
28339	28346	28347	28347	she	889	" You love me , Richard , "
28370	28390	28347	28347	she	889	" you love me ; and I feel — I know that I am not worthy of your affection ! "
28448	28464	28466	28466	Diana	889	" Ah ! I knew that I should remind you of your duty towards yourself , "
28470	28533	28466	28466	Diana	889	" No — I am not worthy of you . But that you may hereafter give me credit for frankness and candour,—that you may be actually warned by myself against myself,—that you may learn to esteem me as a friend , if you will , I shall in a few words relate to you the incidents that made me what I am ! "
28534	28537	28539	28539	Richard	874	" Proceed , "
28541	28555	28539	28539	Richard	874	" proceed ! Believe me I shall listen with attention,—with the greatest attention ! "
28556	28564	28566	28567	Mrs. Arlington	891	" My father was a retired tradesman , "
28569	29014	28566	28567	Mrs. Arlington	891	" and as I was his only child and he enjoyed a competency , he gave me the best education that money could procure . Probably the good old man made up his mind that I should one day espouse a nobleman ; and , as my mother had died when I was very young , there was no one near me to correct the vanity with which my father 's adulation and ambitious pretensions inspired me . About three years ago I met at the theatre — whither I went with some friends — a young gentleman — tall , handsome , and fascinating like yourself . He contrived to obtain a formal introduction to my father , and was invited to our house , at which he speedily became a constant visitor . He had a happy tact in suiting his humours or tastes to those with whom he came in contact ; and he quite won my father 's heart by playing chess with him , telling him the news of the City , and reading the evening paper to him . George Montague soon became an established favourite ; and my father could do nothing without him . At length Montague proposed to him certain speculations in the funds : my father was allured by the prospect of quadrupling his capital , and consented . I must confess that the young man 's handsome person had produced a certain effect upon me — a giddy young girl as I was at that time ; and I rather encouraged my father in these schemes than otherwise . At first the speculations were eminently successful ; but in a short time they took a turn . Day after day did Montague come to the house to announce fresh losses and the necessity of farther advances . He declared that he should now speculate for a grand stake , which could not fail shortly to turn to his advantage . A species of infatuation seized upon my father ; and I was not aware of the ruinous course he was pursuing until it was too late . At length my father was totally ruined ; and George come to announce to us the failure of our last chance . My father now repented when it was too late . Eight short months had sufficed to dissipate his whole fortune ; he had not even enough left to pay the few debts which he had contracted , and which he had neglected to liquidate , trusting each day to the arrival of the lucky moment when he should find himself the master of millions ! "
29015	29022	29024	29024	Richard	874	" Oh ! the absurd hope ! "
29032	29057	29059	29059	Diana	889	" Alas ! this event was a fatal blow to my father 's health , at the same time that it wrecked his happiness , "
29061	29118	29059	29059	Diana	889	" He implored Montague not to desert ' his darling child'—for so he called me — in case anything should happen to himself ; and that same day — the day on which he saw all his prospects and hopes in this life blasted — he put a period to his existence by means of poison ! "
29119	29124	29126	29126	Markham	874	" This was horrible ! "
29128	29135	29126	29126	Markham	874	" Oh ! that villain Montague ! "
29136	29150	29152	29152	Diana	889	" My father 's creditors came to seize the few effects which remained , "
29158	29233	29152	29152	Diana	889	" and I was about to be turned houseless and unprotected into the streets , when Montague arrived . He took gold from his pocket , and satisfied the demands of the creditors . He moreover supplied me with money for my immediate wants . I was totally dependent upon him;—I had no relations — no friends to whom I could apply for succour or comfort . He seemed to commiserate my position — — "
29234	29237	29239	29239	Richard	874	" Perhaps , "
29241	29262	29239	29239	Richard	874	" he was not so very guilty , after all , relative to the loss of your father 's property ? "
29263	29269	29271	29271	Diana	889	" Judge by the sequel , "
29274	29338	29271	29271	Diana	889	" He was as base as he was in reality unfeeling . The transition from that state of dependence upon a young man to a more degraded one still , was to be expected . He no longer talked to me of marriage , as he once had done ; but he took advantage of my forlorn situation . I became his mistress . "
29339	29354	29356	29356	Richard	874	" Ah ! it was base — it was ungenerous — it was unmanly ! "
29358	29477	29356	29356	Richard	874	" He seemed to be possessed of ample resources ; but he accounted for this circumstance by assuring me that he had found another friend who was backing him in the same speculations in which my poor father had failed . We lived together for four months ; and he then coolly informed me that we must part . I found that I had never really entertained any very sincere affection for him ; and the little love which I experienced at first , had been quenched in my bosom by his cold cruelty . He seemed unfeeling to a degree . Observations , calculated to wound most acutely , fell from his lips upon all occasions — — "
29478	29482	29484	29484	Richard	874	" The dastard ! "
29492	29932	29484	29484	Richard	874	" If I wept at this cruelty , he treated me with increased brutality . You may , therefore , suppose that I was not deeply distressed to part with him . He gave me twenty guineas , and bade me a chilling farewell . From that moment I have neither seen nor heard of him . A few weeks after our separation my money was exhausted . I resolved to lead a virtuous and honourable life , and atone for my first fault . O God ! I did not then know that society will not receive the penitent frail one;—that society excludes poor deceived woman from all hopes of reparation , all chances of repentance ! I endeavoured to obtain a situation as a governess;—I might as well have attempted to make myself queen of England . Character — references ! I had neither . Vainly did I implore one lady to whom I applied to give me a month 's trial . She insulted me grossly . To another I candidly confessed my entire history : she patiently heard me to the end , and then ordered her lacquey to turn me out of the house . Oh ! society does more than punish : it pursues the unfortunate female who has made one false step , with the most avenging and malignant cruelty;—it hunts her to suicide or to new ways of crime . These are the dread alternatives . At that moment , had some friendly hand been stretched out to aid me,—had I met with one kind heart that would have believed in the possibility of repentance,—had I only been blest with the chance of entering upon a career of virtue , I should have been saved ! Yes — I should have redeemed my first fault , as far as redemption was possible;—and to accomplish that aim , I would have worked my nails down to the very quick,—I would have accepted any position , however menial,—I would have made any sacrifice , enjoyed any lot , so long as I was assured of earning my bread in a manner which need not make me blush . But society treated me with contempt . Why , in this Christian country , do they preach the Christian maxim , that ' there is more joy over one sinner who repenteth , than over ninety - and - nine just persons who need no repentance ? ' Why is this maxim preached , when the entire conduct of society expresses in terms which can not be misunderstood , a bold denial of its truth ? "
29933	29937	29939	29939	Richard	874	" Merciful heavens , "
29941	29962	29939	29939	Richard	874	" can this be true ? are you drawing a correct picture , Diana , or inventing a hideous fiction ? "
29963	29973	29975	29976	Mrs. Arlington	891	" God knows how true is all I say ! "
29986	30025	29975	29976	Mrs. Arlington	891	" Want soon stared me in the face : what could I do ? Chance threw me in the way of Sir Rupert Harborough:—compelled by an imperious necessity , I became his mistress . This is my history . "
30026	30034	30036	30036	Richard	874	" And the baronet treats you kindly ? "
30040	30064	30036	30036	Richard	874	" The terms upon which our connexion is based do not permit him an opportunity of being either very kind or very cruel . "
30065	30075	30077	30077	Markham	874	" I must now say farewell for the present , "
30101	30149	30036	30036	Richard	874	" In a day or two I will see you again . Oh ! I can not blame you for what you have done:—I commiserate — I pity you ! Could any sacrifice that I am capable of making , restore you to happiness and — and — "
30150	30157	30159	30159	Diana	889	" Honour , you would say , "
30163	30171	30173	30173	Richard	874	" I would gladly make that sacrifice , "
30175	30204	30205	30207	The young man	2266	" From this moment we will be friends — very sincere friends . I will be your brother , dearest Diana — and you shall be my sister ! "
30405	30421	30423	30423	he	911	" that , for his part , he was very well disposed for a spree ; "
30457	30468	30470	30470	Whittingham	881	" I wonder what them urchins are garping at so , "
30472	30506	30470	30470	Whittingham	881	" It mystificates me in no inconsiderable degree . Raly the lower orders of English is exceedingly imperlite . I feel the most inwigorated disgust and the most unboundless contempt for their manners . "
30507	30514	30516	30516	Suggett	911	" That 's jist like me , "
30518	30545	30516	30516	Suggett	911	" I ca n't a - bear the lower orders . I hate everythink wulgar.—But , by the bye , Mr. Whittingham , do you smoke ? "
30546	30566	30568	30569	the butler	26635	" I ca n't say but what I like a full - flavoured Havannah — a threepenny , mind , "
30573	30595	30568	30569	the butler	26635	" Just my taste , Mr. Whittingham . If I ca n't afford threepennies , I wo n't smoke at all . "
30715	30722	30724	30724	he	911	" This is a nice crib , "
30726	30741	30724	30724	he	911	" Excellent company ; and to - night there is a supper at eleven . "
30742	30748	30750	30751	Mr. Whittingham	881	" The very identified thing , "
30786	30789	30773	30774	the Servants	2611	" young lady "
30826	30839	30814	30814	himself	2616	" at three - pence a - pot in your own jugs . "

30884	30895	30897	30903	a second , who was more familiar	2622	" A quartern of gin and three outs , Caroline , "
30905	30916	30918	30919	a third	2623	" Pint of half - and - half , here , "
30921	30948	30950	30951	the waiter	2624	" Six of brandy , warm , Miss — four of gin , cold , and a pint of ale with the chill off — parlour ! "
30962	30987	30989	30993	a pretty little servant girl	2625	" Pot of porter ; and master 's compliments , and can you lend him yesterday 's Advertiser for half an hour or so ? "
31009	31019	30989	30993	a pretty little servant girl	2625	" Pot of ale , and a screw , Miss. "
31020	31030	30989	30993	a pretty little servant girl	2625	" Pint of gin , for mixing , please . "

31289	31295	31297	31298	the waiter	2624	" Good evening , Sir , "
31322	31327	31297	31298	the waiter	2624	" using the house . "
31328	31335	31337	31338	Mr. Suggett	911	" How are you , William ? "
31345	31351	31337	31338	Mr. Suggett	911	" George been here lately ? "
31352	31365	31297	31298	the waiter	2624	" Not very : I think he 's down in the country . "
31366	31383	31337	31338	Mr. Suggett	911	" Oh ! Well , what shall we have , Mr. Whittingham — brandy and water ? "
31384	31394	31337	31338	Mr. Suggett	911	" That 's my inwariable beverage , Mr. Suggett . "
31395	31401	31403	31404	the waiter	2624	" Two sixes , gentlemen ? "
31406	31409	31403	31404	the waiter	2624	" No , "
31416	31426	31411	31412	Mr. Whittingham	881	" two shillings ' worth , to begin with . "

31834	31843	31845	31846	the bookseller	2654	" Pretty well — pretty well , thank'ee , "

32125	32141	32054	32056	another old acquaintance	2661	" About . What grade do you now fill in the profession ? Any promotion ? "
32142	32150	32152	32153	Mr. Snoggles	923	" I 'm sorry to say not , "

32332	32362	32323	32324	the butler	26635	" Mr. Richard Markham is the finest young man about this stupendous city of the whole universe — and that 's as true as that this is a hand . "

32587	32590	32585	32585	Whittingham	881	" Bribery , "
32595	32608	32610	32610	Suggett	911	" No , let us have a bowl of punch at once , "
32612	32616	32618	32619	the lawyer	2668	" And corruption , "
32709	32724	32726	32727	Mr. Cobbington	921	" I hope to have your patronage , sir , for my circulating library , "
32732	32747	32726	32727	Mr. Cobbington	921	" Depends , sir , upon the specified nature of the books it contains , "
32752	32769	32726	32727	Mr. Cobbington	921	" I have nothing but moral romances in which vice is always punished and virtue rewarded . "
32770	32781	32797	32797	his	920	" That conduct of yours is highly credulous to you . "
32782	32791	32793	32794	Mr. Drummer	920	" All books is trash , except one , "
32804	32825	32797	32797	his	920	" They teaches naught but swearing , lewd conversation , ungodliness , and that worst of all vices — intemperance . "
32826	32835	32837	32838	Mr. Guffins	918	" I beg you to understand , sir , "
32859	32884	32837	32838	Mr. Guffins	918	" I beg you to understand , Mr. Drummer , my works , sir , are not the trash you seem to allude to . "
32885	32894	32896	32898	the reverend gentleman	27110	" I wo n't understand nothing nor nobody , "
32908	32933	32896	32898	the reverend gentleman	27110	" Leave me to commune with myself upon the vanities of this wicked world , and — and — drink my punch in quiet . "
32934	32937	32939	32941	the literary man	2679	" Humbug ! "
32954	32957	32959	32960	the bookseller	2654	" Ah ! "
32966	33145	32959	32960	the bookseller	2654	" nothing now succeeds unless it 's in the comic line . We have comic Latin grammars , and comic Greek grammars ; indeed , I do n't know but what English grammar , too , is a comedy altogether . All our tragedies are made into comedies by the way they are performed ; and no work sells without comic illustrations to it . I have brought out several new comic works , which have been very successful . For instance , ' The Comic Wealth of Nations ; ' ' The Comic Parliamentary Speeches ; ' ' The Comic Report of the Poor - Law Commissioners , ' with an Appendix containing the ' Comic Dietary Scale ; ' and the ' Comic Distresses of the Industrious Population . ' I even propose to bring out a ' Comic Whole Duty of Man . ' All these books sell well : they do admirably for the nurseries of the children of the aristocracy . In fact they are as good as manuals and text - books . "
33146	33157	33159	33160	the butler	26635	" This rage for the comic is most unexpressedly remarkable , "
33162	33167	33183	33183	he	26635	" It is indeed ! "
33201	33211	33213	33215	the reverend gentleman	27110	" That 's right — stone me to death ! "
33217	33262	33213	33215	the reverend gentleman	27110	" My name is Stephen — and it is all for righteousness ' sake ! I know I 'm a chosen vessel , and may become a martyr . My name is Stephen , I tell you — Stephen Drum — um — ummer ! "
33365	33380	33382	33383	Mac Chizzle	919	" We must certainly have those two men bound over to keep the peace , "
33385	33399	33382	33383	Mac Chizzle	919	" two sureties in fifty , and themselves in a hundred , each . "
33400	33414	33416	33417	Mr. Guffins	918	" I shall dress the whole scene up for one of the Monthlies , "
33419	33431	33433	33434	Mac Chizzle	919	" If you do , you 'll be indictable for libel , "
33436	33447	33433	33434	Mac Chizzle	919	" The greater the truth , the greater the libel . "
33467	33480	33482	33483	the latter	2065	" It must be about three years since I saw you last , "
33485	33492	33494	33494	Suggett	911	" Three year , come January , "
33496	33509	33511	33511	Snoggles	923	" Ah ! I 've seed some strange wicissitudes in the interval , "
33513	33531	33511	33511	Snoggles	923	" I went abroad as coachman , with a dashing young chap of the name of Winchester — "
33532	33550	33564	33565	the ostler	2689	" The devil you did ! how singular ! why my present guvner 's name is Chichester . "
33551	33562	33564	33565	the ostler	2689	" Well , I des say they 're cousins then , "
33567	33734	33564	33565	the ostler	2689	" but I hope your'n wo n't treat you as mine did me . He seemed to have no end of tin for some months , and lived — my eye , how he lived ! King 's Bench dinners ai n't nothin' to what his'n was ; and yet I 've heard say that the prisoners live there better than their creditors outside . Howsomever — things did n't always go on swimmingly . We went to Baden — called so cos of the baths ; and there my guvner got involved in some gambling transactions , as forced him to make his name Walker . Well , he bolted , leaving all his traps behind , and me amongst them , and not a skurrick to pay the hotel bill and find my way back agin to England . The landlord he seized the traps , and I was forced to walk all the way to — I forget the name of the place — "
33735	33740	33742	33742	Suggett	911	" Constantinople , perhaps , "
33756	33764	33766	33766	Snoggles	923	" No ; that ai n't it , "
33768	33820	33766	33766	Snoggles	923	" Howsomever , I had every kind of difficulty to fight up against ; and I never see my guvner from that day to this . He owed me eight pound , nineteen , and sixpence for wages ; and he was bound by contract to bring me back to England . "
33821	33829	33831	33832	Mr. Suggett	911	" Disgraceful raskel , that he was ! "
33834	33871	33831	33832	Mr. Suggett	911	" I raly think that we gentlemen ought to establish a society for our protection . The Licensed Witlers have their Association ; why should n't we have the Gentlemen 's Gentlemen organized into a society ? "
33872	33876	33878	33878	Snoggles	923	" Why not ? "
34015	34020	34011	34011	he	2703	" ask a blessing , "
34202	34217	34176	34177	the landlord	2618	" D — n your eyes , do n't cut it so infernally thick ! "
34221	34224	34172	34172	he	920	" glasses round "
34353	34357	34312	34312	their	2716	" crying drunk . "
35117	35122	35124	35124	he	886	" My dear Markham , "
35126	35220	35111	35112	Mr. Chichester	886	" you must excuse the liberty which I take in thus intruding upon your privacy ; but what is the meaning of this ? You were to lunch with Harborough to - day , and we were all to dine together in the evening . You called at Diana 's ; and from what you said upon leaving , she fancied you were coming straight home . So I have galloped all this way after you . You shut yourself up from your friends as if you had a design upon your life . "
35221	35234	35111	35112	Mr. Chichester	886	" I am not well — I am anxious to be alone . "
35235	35246	35248	35248	Chichester	886	" But I shall not allow you to remain alone , "
35250	35283	35248	35248	Chichester	886	" If you should feel melancholy , what guarantee have I that you will not commit suicide , or do what is nearly as bad — sit down and write sentimental poetry ? "
35284	35294	35111	35112	Mr. Chichester	886	" I am not very likely to do either . "
35295	35307	35111	35112	Mr. Chichester	886	" You must come and join us : the baronet — — "
35308	35314	35248	35248	Chichester	886	" I would rather — — "
35315	35333	35111	35112	Mr. Chichester	886	" I can take no excuse . Order round your chestnut , and let us be off . "
35334	35349	35351	35351	Markham	874	" Well — at all events I must go straight into the City first , "
35353	35365	35351	35351	Markham	874	" I have occasion to call at my guardian 's banker . "
35366	35392	35111	35112	Mr. Chichester	886	" Will you join me at seven precisely this evening , at Harborough 's own lodgings in Conduit - street ? We shall expect you . "
35393	35400	35402	35402	Markham	874	" You may rely upon me , "
35414	35421	35402	35402	Markham	874	" But who will be there ? "
35422	35518	35111	35112	Mr. Chichester	886	" Only the baronet , you , I , and Talbot — a partie quarre . Talbot is really a good fellow at heart , and has taken a great liking to you . Besides , he is the most liberal and generous fellow in existence . He sent a hundred pounds to every hospital in London yesterday morning — his annual donations ; and he thinks that no one knows anything about it . He always puts himself down as X. Y. Z. in the lists of charitable subscriptions : he is so unostentatious ! "
35519	35528	35111	35112	Mr. Chichester	886	" Those are admirable traits in his character . "
35529	35650	35652	35653	Mr. Chichester	886	" They are , indeed . Just now , for instance , he heard of a horrid case of distress . Only conceive a poor man , with nine small children and a wife just ready to present him with a tenth , dragged to Whitecross Street Prison , for a paltry hundred pounds ! Talbot instantly called me aside , and said , ' Chichester , my dear fellow , I have not time to attend to any business to - day . There is a five hundred pound note ; have the kindness to get it changed for me , and devote a hundred pounds to save the unhappy family . ' Those were Talbot 's own words , "
35665	35675	35677	35677	Richard	874	" How liberal ! how grand ! how noble ! "
35698	35745	35689	35689	he	874	" To be candid with you , I am myself going to the banker 's to draw some money ; and when I see you this evening , I shall be happy to place twenty pounds in your hands for the use of that poor family . "
35746	35769	35652	35653	Mr. Chichester	886	" No , my dear fellow , keep your money : the baronet and I shall take care of those poor people . "
35770	35776	35677	35677	Richard	874	" Nay — I insist — "
35777	35792	35689	35689	he	874	" Well — I am sorry now that I told you of the circumstance . "
35793	35800	35652	35653	Mr. Chichester	886	" And I am very glad . "
35801	35818	35820	35820	Chichester	886	" There — you shall have your own way then . But , by the by , "
35830	35844	35820	35820	Chichester	886	" you are going into the City , and to your banker 's ? "
35845	35851	35652	35653	Mr. Chichester	886	" Yes . And you ? "
35852	35868	35870	35870	Chichester	886	" I am anxious to get back to the West End as hastily as possible , "
35872	35884	35870	35870	Chichester	886	" You could do me a service , if you would ? "
35885	35889	35891	35891	Richard	874	" Name it , "
35893	35904	35906	35906	Chichester	886	" Get this note changed for me in the City , "
35927	35932	35934	35934	Markham	874	" Oh ! certainly , "
35993	35996	35998	35998	Chichester	886	" There ! "
36007	36019	35998	35998	Chichester	886	" I knew that my melancholy young gentleman would be punctual . "
36020	36028	36030	36031	the baronet	26709	" Delighted to see you , Markham , "
36042	36050	36052	36052	Talbot	894	" How are you , my tulip ? "
36054	36065	36052	36052	Talbot	894	" Why , Chichester said you had the blue devils ! "
36066	36077	36079	36079	Richard	874	" I really felt unequal to society to - day , "
36081	36091	36079	36079	Richard	874	" and I fancied that a little rest — — "
36092	36097	36099	36100	Mr. Talbot	894	" A little humbug ! "
36102	36143	36099	36100	Mr. Talbot	894	" That 's all my eye and my elbow , Markham . A d — d good bottle of champagne will soon put you to rights . But when I 'm ill , what do you think I always take ? "
36144	36151	36052	36052	Talbot	894	" I really ca n't guess . "
36152	36236	36052	36052	Talbot	894	" Why , going to bed I always take a pint of dog 's nose . There 's nothing like dog's - nose for getting into the system . You must have it in the pewter , you know — and nice and hot : you will then sweat a bucket - full in the course of the night , and get up in the morning as right as a trivet . I can assure you there 's nothing like dog's - nose . "
36237	36246	36248	36248	Richard	874	" And pray what is dog's - nose ! "
36250	36304	36248	36248	Richard	874	" Well , may I be hanged ! you are jolly green not to know what dog's - nose is ! You take half a pint of the best half - and - half — or you may have ale all alone , if you like — a quartern of blue ruin — — "
36305	36318	36320	36321	Mr. Chichester	886	" It is a mixture of gin , beer , and sugar , "
36325	36349	36351	36351	Talbot	894	" Well , and why could n't you let me tell the gentleman how to make dog's - nose in my own manner ? "
36356	36386	36351	36351	Talbot	894	" However , there 's nothing better than dog's - nose for the gripes , or wind on the stomach , or the rheumatics . For my part — — "
36387	36394	36396	36399	the Honourable Arthur Chichester	886	" D — n your part ! "
36474	36490	36508	36508	he	886	" There is your change , together with my twenty pounds for the poor family . "
36491	36498	36500	36500	Chichester	886	" Thank you , my boy , "
36539	36545	36523	36525	Meantime Mr. Talbot	894	" he was uncommonly peckish , "
36582	36588	36590	36590	Chichester	886	" This soup is unexceptionable , "
36592	36611	36590	36590	Chichester	886	" I never tasted better save once — and that was at the King of Prussia 's table . "
36612	36637	36639	36640	Mr. Talbot	894	" Ah ! I once had d — d good pea - soup , I remember , at the Duke of Lambeth 's table , "
36642	36659	36639	36640	Mr. Talbot	894	" But , I say , who the devil 's that kicking my unfortunate soft corn ? "
36660	36668	36670	36670	Chichester	886	" A glass of wine , Markham ? "
36671	36681	36683	36683	Talbot	894	" I suppose we 'd all better join in , "
36685	36699	36701	36702	the baronet	26709	" I shall be happy to drink wine with you , Mr. Talbot , "
36712	36718	36701	36702	the baronet	26709	" Just as you please , "
36742	36782	36701	36702	the baronet	26709	" I wonder what 's coming next . I say , Harborough , you have n't ordered any tripe , have you ? I am so fond of tripe . There 's nothing like tripe and onions for supper . "
36848	36888	36835	36835	Chichester	886	" Excuse me : but you went to your banker 's to - day . If you have much money about you , it is not safe to carry it about the streets of London at night - time . "
36889	36904	36906	36906	Markham	874	" I have fifty - five pounds in gold and fifty pounds in notes , "
36908	36914	36916	36916	Chichester	886	" Notes are safe enough , "
36918	36993	36916	36916	Chichester	886	" but gold is dangerous . Some one would be sure to frisk your purse . Here — I tell you how we can manage it — give me fifty sovereigns , and I will give you a fifty pound note in exchange . I can then lock up the gold in the baronet 's writing - desk , the key of which , I see , he has fortunately left in the lock . "
37017	37028	37030	37030	Richard	874	" I am much obliged to you for the thought , "
37032	37040	37030	37030	Richard	874	" it is very considerate of you . "
37157	37165	37154	37155	the baronet	26709	" that it was devilish slow work ; "
37172	37176	37178	37179	Mr. Chichester	886	" a spree ; "
37181	37215	37178	37179	Mr. Chichester	886	" that as his friend Markham was anxious to see life , the best thing they could all do was to drop in for an hour at No . — — , Quadrant . "
37216	37222	37224	37224	Markham	874	" What place is that ? "
37226	37242	37245	37245	Chichester	886	" Oh ; only an establishment for cards and dice , and other innocent diversions , "
37591	37594	37596	37602	the man to whom the countenance belonged	2787	" Well ? "
37604	37608	37610	37610	Chichester	886	" All right , "
38298	38319	38362	38362	he	874	" Tell me , is this a Gambling - House ? is it what I have heard called a Hell ? "
38320	38336	38362	38362	he	874	" It is a Gambling - House , if you will , my dear fellow , "
38341	38358	38362	38362	he	874	" but a most respectable one . Besides — you must see life , you know ! "
38443	38450	38452	38454	the young officer	2828	" Well , this is extraordinary ! "
38456	38492	38452	38454	the young officer	2828	" I never saw the luck set so completely in against me . However — I can afford to lose a little ; for I broke your bank for you last night , my boys ? "
38493	38499	38501	38501	Richard	874	" What does that mean ? "
38506	38524	38526	38526	Chichester	886	" He won all the money which the proprietor deposited in that tin case , he means , "
38528	38539	38526	38526	Chichester	886	" And how much do you suppose that might be ? "
38540	38549	38557	38569	the young officer , who had just lost another stake,—"a glass of claret	27203	" About fifteen hundred to two thousand pounds . "
38550	38555	38557	38569	the young officer , who had just lost another stake,—"a glass of claret	27203	" Here — waiter ! "
38566	38571	38557	38569	the young officer , who had just lost another stake,—"a glass of claret	27203	stake,—"a glass of claret . "
38637	38642	38643	38643	he	2828	" Fool ! idiot ! "
38651	38684	38643	38643	he	2828	" bring me a tumbler — a large tumbler full of claret ; my mouth is as parched as h — l , and my stomach is like a lime - kiln . "
38715	38719	38720	38720	he	2833	" A cigar ! "
38728	38733	38720	38720	he	2833	excitement—"bring me a cigar ! "
38751	38773	38775	38776	the gamester	2835	" Why the devil do n't you bring a light at the same time , you d — d infernal rascal ? "
38836	38852	38854	38856	the young officer	2828	" That makes three thousand that I have lost already , by G — d ! "
38858	38870	38872	38875	one of the Bonnets	2841	" Including the amount you won last night , I believe , "
38877	38895	38897	38898	the officer	2833	" Well , sir , and suppose it is — what the deuce is that to you ? "
38901	38972	38973	38973	He	2828	" Have I not been here night after night for these six weeks ? and have I not lost thousands — thousands ? When did I ever get a vein of good luck until last night ? But never mind — I'll play on — I'll play till the end : I will either win all back , or lose everything together . And then — in the latter case — "
38995	39001	39002	39002	he	2828	" Claret — more claret ! "
39010	39020	39002	39002	he	2828	" that cigar only makes me the more thirsty . "
39027	39040	39042	39042	Markham	874	" I am really afraid to contemplate that young man 's countenance , "
39046	39050	39042	39042	Markham	874	" Why so ? "

39095	39107	39044	39044	Chichester	886	" Pray be quiet . They will only laugh at you . "
39108	39118	39042	39042	Markham	874	" But the life of a fellow - creature ? "
39119	39125	38989	38989	he	2828	" What do they care ? "
39126	39137	39044	39044	Chichester	886	" Do you mean to say they are such wretches — "
39138	39159	39042	39042	Markham	874	" I mean that they do not care one fig what may happen so long as they get the money . "
39339	39355	39356	39356	he	2828	" Well — I said I would play until I won all or lost all , "
39359	39380	39356	39356	he	2828	" and I have done so . Waiter , give me another tumbler of claret : it will compose me . "

39432	39437	39426	39427	the Croupiers	935	" Yes , sir ; "
39480	39488	39490	39492	the young officer	2828	" Where is my hat , waiter ? "
39508	39518	39500	39500	he	2828	" In the passage , sir — I believe . "
39519	39544	39559	39561	The young officer	2828	" No — I remember , it is in the inner room . But do not trouble yourself — I will fetch it myself . "
39545	39551	39553	39554	the waiter	2624	" Very good , sir ; "
39578	39584	39586	39586	Markham	874	" What a shocking scene ! "
39590	39613	39586	39586	Markham	874	" I am glad I came hither this once : it will be a lesson for me which I can never forget . "

40094	40100	40102	40103	the inspector	2878	" Well , what now ? "
40125	40190	40191	40192	The inspector	2878	" Me , and Jones , and Jenkins , broke into No . — , in the Quadrant , as we heard a pistol — or else we should ha ' known ourselves better ; and this young feller is all we caught . Jones and Jenkins is staying in the house along with the dead body of the man as killed his self . "
40214	40229	40211	40211	he	2878	" Now , Crisp , we 'll enter that charge , if you please . "
40284	40293	40267	40268	the inspector	2878	" What is your name , young man ? "
40294	40298	40267	40268	the inspector	2878	" Richard Markham . "
40299	40316	40267	40268	the inspector	2878	" Oh ! Richard Markham . Put that down , Crisp . Where do you live ? "
40317	40325	40267	40268	the inspector	2878	" At Markham Place , near Holloway . "
40326	40351	40267	40268	the inspector	2878	" Put that down , Crisp . Now , do you want to let any of your friends know that you are in trouble ? "
40352	40368	40267	40268	the inspector	2878	" First tell me of what I am accused , and why I am detained . "
40369	40412	40267	40268	the inspector	2878	" You are accused of being in an unlawful house for an unlawful purpose — namely , gambling ; and a suicide has been committed there , they say . You will be wanted afore the coroner as well as the magistrate . "
40413	40429	40267	40268	the inspector	2878	" Can I be released until to - morrow by giving security for my appearance ? "
40430	40494	40267	40268	the inspector	2878	" No — I ca n't part with you . It is said that it is suicide — and I believe it : still it might be murder . But you seem a respectable young gentleman , and so you sha'nt be locked up in a cell all night . You may sit here by the fire , if you 'll be quiet . "
40495	40537	40267	40268	the inspector	2878	" I am at least obliged to you for this courtesy . But can you give me any idea of the extent of the penalty to which I am liable ? I did not gamble myself — I merely accompanied — — "
40538	40547	40549	40550	the Inspector	2878	" You need'nt criminate anybody , you know , "
40552	40568	40549	40550	the Inspector	2878	" The Magistrate will fine you a few pounds , and that will be all . "
40569	40583	40585	40585	Markham	874	" Then I should prefer not to acquaint my friends with my position , "
40587	40601	40585	40585	Markham	874	" since I can release myself from my present difficulty without their assistance . "
40744	40748	40741	40748	persons who were " in trouble , "	27239	" in trouble , "
40764	40777	40779	40779	Crisp	939	" Crankey Jem has done it brown at last , has'nt he ? "
40781	40786	40788	40789	the inspector	2878	" He has indeed , "
40791	40801	40788	40789	the inspector	2878	" But what could he have done with all the swag?"[1
40803	40813	40815	40819	the officer in plain clothes	2902	" Oh ! he 's fadded that safe enough , "
40821	40841	40815	40819	the officer in plain clothes	2902	" My eye ! What a slap - up lily benjamin[3 ] he had on when he was nabbed . "
40842	40855	40788	40789	the inspector	2878	" Yes — and sich a swell bandanna fogle in the gropus . "[5
40857	40886	40815	40819	the officer in plain clothes	2902	" He had'nt any ready tin though ; for he wanted to peel , and put the white - poodle up the spout for a drop of max . "[8
40888	40911	40788	40789	the inspector	2878	" And because you would'nt let him he doubled you up with a wallop in your dumpling - depot,[9 ] did'nt he ? "
40912	40925	40815	40819	the officer in plain clothes	2902	" Yes — but I bruised his canister[10 ] for him though . "
40926	40946	40815	40819	the officer in plain clothes	2902	" This 'll be the third time he 's been up afore the beaks[11 ] at the Old Bailey . "
40947	40957	40788	40789	the inspector	2878	" Consequently he 's sartain sure to be lagged . "[12
40959	40979	40815	40819	the officer in plain clothes	2902	" Ah ! it must be a clever nob in the fur trade[13 ] who 'll get him off . "
40980	40988	40990	40990	Crisp	939	" Well — talking makes me thirsty , "
40992	41005	40990	40990	Crisp	939	" I wish I 'd someot to sluice my ivories[14 ] with . "

41112	41118	41120	41121	the inspector	2878	" What 's the charge ? "
41123	41129	41131	41132	the constable	2911	" A rogue and vagabond , "
41134	41151	41131	41132	the constable	2911	" Oh ! very well : put that down , Crisp . How do you know ? "
41152	41179	41238	41239	the constable	2911	" Because he 's wandering about and has n't no where to go to , and no friends to refer to and I saw him begging . "
41180	41200	41238	41239	the constable	2911	" Very good ; put that down , Crisp . And I suppose he 's without food and hungry ? "
41201	41208	41210	41219	the poor wretch , who stood shivering at the bar	2912	" I have not tasted food — "
41221	41227	41229	41230	the inspector	2878	" Come , no lies , "
41232	41236	41238	41239	the constable	2911	" No lies ! "
41249	41259	41238	41239	the constable	2911	" Have you put it all down , Crisp ? "
41260	41265	41238	41239	the constable	2911	" Yes , sir . "
41266	41296	41297	41299	The poor creature	2916	" Well , let him have a bit of bread , and lock him up . He 'll get three months of it on the stepper to - morrow . "
41318	41331	41333	41333	Markham	874	" What do you think that unfortunate creature will be done to ? "
41335	41349	41333	41333	Markham	874	" Three months on the stepper — the treadmill , to be sure . "
41350	41355	41238	41239	the constable	2911	" But what for ? "
41356	41365	41238	41239	the constable	2911	" Why , for a rogue and vagabond . "
41366	41373	41375	41375	Markham	874	" A vagabond he may be , "
41377	41397	41375	41375	Markham	874	" because he has no home to go to ; but how do you know he is a rogue ? "
41398	41410	41238	41239	the constable	2911	" Why — he was found begging , was n't he ? "
41411	41421	41238	41239	the constable	2911	" And does that make a man a rogue ? "
41422	41434	41238	41239	the constable	2911	" Certainly it do — in the eye of the law . "
41435	41447	41449	41450	Mr. Crisp	939	" Ah ! and that eye can see without spectacles too , "
41492	41500	41502	41503	the inspector	2878	" Well , what 's the charge ? "
41505	41543	41502	41503	the inspector	2878	" This fellow will come upon my beat with his apple - cart , and I ca n't keep him off . So I 've sent his cart to the Green Yard , and brought him here . "
41544	41549	41551	41553	the poor fellow	2922	" Please , sir , "
41563	41687	41551	41553	the poor fellow	2922	" I endeavour to earn an honest living by selling a little fruit in the streets . I have a wife and seven children to support , and I only stayed out so long to - night because I had had a bad day of it , and the money is so much wanted at home — it is indeed , sir ! I do hope you 'll let me go , sir : my poor wife will be ready to break her heart when she finds that I do n't come home ; and my eldest boy always sits up for me . Poor little fellow ! he will cry so if he do n't kiss Father before he goes to bed . "
41757	41768	41770	41771	the inspector	2878	" Come , Crisp — have you got that down ? "
41773	41778	41770	41771	the inspector	2878	" Yes , sir . "
41779	41797	41770	41771	the inspector	2878	" Well , let the man be locked up : the magistrate must decide in the morning . "
41815	41828	41830	41830	Markham	874	" I could not exactly understand what this new prisoner has done , "
41832	41841	41843	41844	the inspector	2878	" Obstructed the way and created a nuisance , "
41847	41870	41843	41844	the inspector	2878	" But he is endeavouring to earn his bread honestly , I think ; and the road is open to every one . "
41871	41923	41954	41954	his	2930	" Oh ! no such thing . Those little carts frighten the horses in the great folks ' carriages , and ca n't be allowed . He must have a month of it — he 's been warned several times , and is incorrigible . I 'll tell the magistrate so . "
41924	41933	41954	41954	his	2930	" And what will become of his family ? "
41934	41948	41843	41844	the inspector	2878	" Family ! why , go to the workhouse , to be sure ! "
41976	41983	41950	41952	a third constable	2930	" What 's the charge now ? "
41984	42045	41954	41954	his	2930	" Charge from the workus . This here o'oman was admitted to - night to the Union with them three children ; and 'cos the master ordered her to be separated from her children , she kicked up hell 's delight . So the master turned 'em all out together , called me up , and give 'em in charge . "
42046	42053	41950	41952	a third constable	2930	" Put that down , Crisp . "
42054	42063	42065	42067	the poor woman	2437	" Yes — and it is true too , "
42069	42130	42065	42067	the poor woman	2437	" I am not ashamed to own that I love my children ; and up to this blessed hour they have never been separated from me . It would break their poor little hearts to be torn away from me — that it would , God bless them ! I love them all , poor — miserable as I am ! "
42143	42146	42148	42148	Markham	874	" Inspector , "
42159	42166	42148	42148	Markham	874	" you will allow me — — "
42167	42187	42065	42067	the poor woman	2437	" Silence , young man . It 's a charge from the workus , and the workus is paramount . "
42188	42195	42197	42197	Richard	874	" So it appears , indeed ! "
42200	42225	42197	42197	Richard	874	" Silence , I say . Do n't interfere , there 's a good lad . Crisp , have you got it all down ? "
42226	42231	42065	42067	the poor woman	2437	" Yes , sir . "
42232	42239	42065	42067	the poor woman	2437	" Lock 'em up , then . "
42240	42248	42250	42252	the unfortunate mother	2935	" At least we shall be together ! "
42296	42302	42274	42275	another policeman	2937	" Well — what now ? "
42303	42323	42065	42067	the poor woman	2437	" Fighting in the Blue Dragon : the landlord turned him out , and so I took him up . "
42324	42340	42274	42275	another policeman	2937	" Put that down , Crisp . What 's your name , my fine fellow ? "
42341	42345	42274	42275	another policeman	2937	" John Snoggles . "
42346	42366	42368	42369	the inspector	2878	" Put that down , Crisp . He 's a nice bird , is n't he , Mr. Markham ? "
42371	42374	42368	42369	the inspector	2878	" Markham ! "
42380	42388	42390	42390	Richard	874	" Yes — that is my name , "
42392	42398	42390	42390	Richard	874	" do you know me ? "
42399	42473	42274	42275	another policeman	2937	" Not that I am aweer of sir . Only the name reminded me that I have been this evening in the company of a gentleman as is in the service of a Mr. Markham . I left the Servants ' Arms at twelve precisely , and walked straight down to this here wicinity — I ai n't been more than half an hour coming — when I gets into a row — — "

42503	42516	42274	42275	another policeman	2937	" With several gentlemen — but the one I named was Vittingham . "
42517	42536	42481	42481	Richard	874	" Whittingham ! he is my butler . Poor fellow ! how anxious he will be about me . "
42537	42546	42548	42548	Snoggles	941	" He 's too drunk to be anxious , "
42551	42562	42548	42548	Snoggles	941	" I was the on'y one as come away sober . "
42563	42576	42578	42579	the inspector	2878	" I tell you what he could do , if you like , "
42602	42632	42578	42579	the inspector	2878	" there is no one here to make any charge against the fellow — the constable will withdraw it , and he can take a note home for you . "
42633	42638	42640	42640	Markham	874	" A thousand thanks ! "
42642	42651	42640	42640	Markham	874	" But you intimated that he was tipsy ? "
42652	42658	42660	42660	Snoggles	941	" He is certainly elevated , "
42662	42681	42660	42660	Snoggles	941	" Well , can you be at my house to - morrow morning by six or seven o'clock ? "
42682	42690	42640	42640	Markham	874	" Of course I can , sir . "
42691	42737	42660	42660	Snoggles	941	" I need not write : you can say that you have seen me , and that I shall be home in the course of the day . Do not mention where I am : I would not have him coming here to seek me . "

44695	44718	44691	44693	the poor creature	2916	" if I could but get to him . He lives in Edinburgh , and is well to do as a wheelwright . "
44719	44730	44732	44732	Richard	874	" Here are two guineas for you , my friend , "
44734	44775	44732	44732	Richard	874	" They will take you home ; and then may your reception be as favourable as you seem to think . There — I do not want you to thank me : go — and commence your journey at once . "
44804	44812	44814	44814	Richard	874	" And now , my good man , "
44824	44832	44814	44814	Richard	874	" what do you propose to do ? "
44833	44905	44814	44814	Richard	874	" To speak the truth , sir , I do n't know . The police seem determined that I sha n't earn an honest livelihood : and as I am equally resolved not to see my children starve before me , I have nothing left to do but to become a thief . I sha n't be the first whom the police have driven to that last resource in this city . "
44906	44911	44913	44913	Markham	874	" You speak bitterly , "
44915	44961	44913	44913	Markham	874	" Yes — because I tell the truth , sir . My cart is to be returned to me ; but of what use is it , or the stock that is in it , since I do n't dare go about to sell fruit ? "
44962	44971	44814	44814	Richard	874	" Could you not open a little shop ? "
44972	44981	44814	44814	Richard	874	" Ah ! sir — that requires money ! "
44982	44986	44913	44913	Markham	874	" How much ? "
44987	44998	45000	45001	the man	2092	" A matter of four or five pounds , sir , "
45003	45014	45000	45001	the man	2092	" and where could a poor devil like me — — "
45015	45026	45028	45028	Markham	874	" I will give you five pounds for the purpose ; "
45094	45109	45111	45111	Markham	874	" And now , my good woman , what can I do for you ? "
45122	45147	45111	45111	Markham	874	" How in the name of heaven , came you reduced , with three children , to such a state of want and destitution ? "
45148	45158	45160	45162	the poor creature	2916	" My husband , sir , is in prison , "
45178	45187	45160	45162	the poor creature	2916	" In prison ! and for what crime ? "
45188	45218	45111	45111	Markham	874	" Oh ! crime , sir — it is only a crime in the eye of the law , but not in the eye of either man or heaven . "
45219	45251	45111	45111	Markham	874	" My good woman , this is absurd . Is there any offence of which the law alone takes cognisance , and which is not reprehensible in the eye of God ? "
45252	45281	45111	45111	Markham	874	" On the contrary , sir — God has given us for our general use and benefit the very thing which the law has forbidden us to take . "
45282	45287	45289	45289	Richard	874	" This is trifling ! "
45292	45310	45289	45289	Richard	874	" Can you , whom I behold so affectionate to your children , be hardened in guilt ? "
45311	45466	45111	45111	Markham	874	" Do not think so , sir ! My husband was a hard working man — never spent an hour at the public - house — never deprived his family of a farthing of his wages . He was a pattern to all married men — and his pride was to see his children well - dressed and happy . Alas , sir — we were too happy not to meet with some sad reverse ! My husband in an evil hour went out shooting one afternoon , when there was a holiday at the factory where he worked ; and he killed a hare upon a nobleman 's grounds near Richmond . He was taken up and tried for poaching , and was sentenced to a year 's imprisonment with hard labour ! This term expires in six weeks ; but in the meantime — O God ! what have we not suffered ! "
45467	45473	45475	45475	Markham	874	" Ah ! forgive me , "
45483	45555	45475	45475	Markham	874	" I spoke harshly to you , because I did not remember that the law could be guilty of a deed of such inhuman atrocity . And yet I have heard of many — many such cases ere now ! Merciful heavens ! is it possible that the law , which with the right hand protects the privileges of the aristocracy , can with the left plunge whole families into despair ! "
45556	45564	45566	45568	the poor woman	2437	" Alas ! it is too true ! "
45578	45595	45597	45597	Markham	874	" Well — cheer up — your husband will be restored to you in six weeks , "
45599	45612	45597	45597	Markham	874	" In the meantime here is wherewith to provide for your family . "
46100	46110	46112	46112	Chichester	886	" I wonder what became of him last night , "
46114	46126	46112	46112	Chichester	886	" Upon my honour at the moment I did not care , "
46131	46145	46112	46112	Chichester	886	" Nor I either . I was only intent upon getting off myself . "
46146	46162	46346	46347	the baronet	26709	" He will not be pleased at our having left him in that unceremonious manner . "
46163	46181	46112	46112	Chichester	886	" Oh ! trust to me — any explanation will do . He is so exceedingly green . "
46182	46207	46112	46112	Chichester	886	" And so marvellously particular in his conduct . If it had not been for us , he would have remained quite a saint . "
46208	46214	46216	46216	Chichester	886	" I am not afraid , "
46218	46327	46216	46216	Chichester	886	" of being able to manage him and of turning him to immense advantage in our plans . But that vulgar beast Talbot will most certainly spoil all . Even the idea of the fellow 's wealth and charities will not always induce Markham to put up with his vulgarities . Besides , the wretch has such execrable bad taste . Last evening , for instance , when I casually dropped a neat little lie about the soup at the King of Prussia 's table , Talbot instantly paraded the Duke of Lambeth 's pea - soup . Only fancy a Duke and pea - soup united together ! "
46328	46344	46346	46347	the baronet	26709	" And then his dog 's nose , and sore feet , and boiled tripe , "
46349	46447	46346	46347	the baronet	26709	" After all the drilling we gave him in the first instance , when he stipulated upon associating with us in order to see how we worked the thing , he is still incorrigible . Then , when I think of all the money I have already laid out in buying the materials — in getting the proper paper — and in keeping him in feather all the time he was at work , my blood boils to see that he hangs like a millstone round our necks , and threatens by his vulgarity to spoil all . "
46448	46455	46457	46457	Chichester	886	" But what could we do ? "
46459	46596	46457	46457	Chichester	886	" You told me in the first instance to find an engraver on whom we could rely ; and I was compelled to enlist the fellow Pocock in our cause . He was the very man , so far as knowledge went , having been employed all his life in working for Bankers . But his atrocious vulgarity is his bane ; and even his aristocratic name of Talbot which I made him assume , does not help him to pass himself off as a gentleman . It was a pity he could not listen to reason and take the sum of ready money down , which you offered him in the first instance . But , no — he must needs cry thirds , and insist upon going about with us to see fair play . "
46597	46603	46605	46606	the baronet	26709	" And get his share , "
46608	46622	46624	46624	Chichester	886	" Yes . Even the very first night that he ever saw Markham , "
46626	46691	46624	46624	Chichester	886	" his greediness would have induced him to risk the ruin of everything by winning a few paltry pounds of the young fellow at Diana 's lodgings . But I d — d soon stopped that . I did n't even want to take the twenty pounds yesterday , which Markham offered for the poor family concerning whom I invented so capital a story . "
46692	46716	46718	46719	the baronet	26709	" No — it is not a few pounds that will do us any good , or remunerate me for my large outlay , "
46721	46805	46718	46719	the baronet	26709	" We want thousands — and this Markham is the very instrument we require . The first trial was made yesterday , and succeeded admirably . The note has actually been changed at a banker 's : no one can expect a better test than that . Now if this Talbot is to ruin us with Markham — the very person we want — the most excellent medium we could require — himself being above all suspicion , and entertaining no suspicion — — "
46806	46817	46819	46819	Chichester	886	" It would be enough to break one 's heart , "
46821	46836	46838	46839	the baronet	26709	" Besides , my creditors are so clamorous , settle with them I must , "
46841	46888	46838	46839	the baronet	26709	" And then Diana costs me a fortune . I must get rid of her without delay ; for I expect that she is getting sentimental on this youth , and will not interest herself in our affair for fear of letting him into a scrape . "
46889	46897	46899	46899	Chichester	886	" Why , it is very certain , "
46901	46987	46899	46899	Chichester	886	" that according to the admirable way in which we have arranged our plans , if an explosion took place , we could not possibly be implicated . However — we must make haste and work London , and then off to Paris . We might get rid of four or five thousand pounds worth amongst the money - changers in the Palais - Royal . Then off to Germany in due rotation — Italy next — touch at Spain — and home to England . "
46988	47006	47008	47009	the baronet	26709	" Upon my honour , it is a noble scheme — a grand , a princely scheme ! "
47016	47036	47008	47009	the baronet	26709	" My God ! if it were spoilt in its infancy by any fault of ours or our associates ! "
47037	47054	47056	47056	Chichester	886	" And Talbot is such a drunken beast , that we can scarcely rely upon him , "
47058	47082	47056	47056	Chichester	886	" He will one day commit himself and us too : the fellow does not know how to get tipsy like a gentleman . "
47083	47097	47099	47100	the baronet	26709	" We will tell him the candid truth and see what he says , "
47101	47193	47056	47056	Chichester	886	" When he finds that we are determined not to tolerate him with us , and that we will quash the whole thing at once if he insists upon remaining , he must yield . There was that young Walter Sydney who seemed at first to have taken a fancy to Diana . I thought of making use of him too;—but he never called again after that drunken display of Mr. Talbot 's . He was evidently disgusted with him for his conduct , and with us for associating with him . "
47194	47197	47199	47199	Chichester	886	" Well , "
47201	47239	47199	47199	Chichester	886	" let us resolve , then , to have an explanation with Talbot in the sense you have mentioned ; and you must also speak seriously to Diana and get her to make use of young Markham . "
47240	47247	47249	47250	the baronet	26709	" And if she will not , "
47252	47285	47249	47250	the baronet	26709	" I shall get rid of her without delay . What is the use of having an expensive mistress , unless you can use her either as a blind or a plant ? "
47325	47332	47334	47334	Chichester	886	" Is your master at home ? "
47336	47392	47334	47334	Chichester	886	" No sir ; he has not domesticated himself in his own abode since he went out shortly after you yesterday . But a person of my acquaintance — a man of perfect credibleness — has just come to ensure me that my young master will be here again in the currency of the day . "
47393	47402	47404	47404	Chichester	886	" Where did this person see your master ? "
47416	47424	47426	47426	Whittingham	881	" His respondencies is evasive and dissatisfactory , "
47428	47434	47436	47436	Chichester	886	" This is very remarkable ! "
47447	47477	47444	47444	he	886	" But we will await Mr. Markham 's return ; and I will just see this man and interrogate him alone — alone , do you hear , Whittingham . "
47478	47502	47444	47444	he	886	" I hear , sir , because my accoustic propensities is good . I will send this person to you into the library . "
47643	47648	47639	47640	a man	2001	" What ? John ! "
47661	47665	47667	47667	Snoggles	941	" Mr. Winchester ! "
47674	47686	47688	47688	Chichester	886	" Hush , my good fellow — don't say a word ! "
47696	47737	47688	47688	Chichester	886	" I am really glad to see you — I have often thought of you since that unpleasant affair . I hope it put you to no inconvenience . At all events , I will make matters all right now . "
47738	47744	47746	47746	Snoggles	941	" Better late than never , "
47748	47793	47746	47746	Snoggles	941	" Well — and you must promise me faithfully not to mention this affair to any one , and I will always stand your friend . And , remember — my name is Chichester now — not Winchester . Pray do not forget that . "
47794	47809	47811	47811	Snoggles	941	" No — no : I 'm fly enough — I'm down to trap , "
47820	47843	47811	47811	Snoggles	941	" Here is a twenty - pound note — that will cover all your losses , and recompense you into the bargain . "
47844	47849	47746	47746	Snoggles	941	" That 'll do . "
47850	47867	47746	47746	Snoggles	941	" It would be better that you should not say that you ever knew me before . "
47868	47874	47811	47811	Snoggles	941	" Just as you like . "
47875	47895	47746	47746	Snoggles	941	" I prefer that course . But now to another point . Where did you see Mr. Richard Markham ? "
47896	47908	47746	47746	Snoggles	941	" At the station - house , in — — street . "
47909	47919	47811	47811	Snoggles	941	" The station - house ! And for what ? "
47920	47968	47746	47746	Snoggles	941	" Ah ! there you beat me . I ca n't say ! All that I know is that he gave me half - a - sovereign to come and tell his old butler this morning that he should be home in the course of the day . "
47969	47977	47746	47746	Snoggles	941	" And that is all you know ? "
47978	47981	47811	47811	Snoggles	941	" Everything . "
47982	47998	48000	48000	Chichester	886	" Now can I rely upon you in respect to keeping the other matter secret ? "
48002	48010	48012	48012	Snoggles	941	" I have already told you so , "
48014	48032	48033	48033	Snoggles	941	" And you need not tell old Whittingham that his master is at the station - house . "
48046	48059	48043	48044	the baronet	26709	" Markham is at the station - house in — — street . "
48060	48070	48108	48109	the baronet	26709	" The deuce he is ! and for what ? "
48071	48094	48043	48044	the baronet	26709	" I can not learn . Do you not think it is odd that he did not send for either of us ? "
48095	48106	48108	48109	the baronet	26709	" Yes . We will return to town this moment , "
48111	48151	48108	48109	the baronet	26709	" and send some one unknown to him to hear the case at the police - office . We shall then learn whether anything concerning the notes transpires , and what to say to him when we see him . "
48152	48163	48165	48165	Chichester	886	" Yes : there is not a moment to lose , "
48253	48267	48269	48269	Snoggles	923	" Well , I 've learnt someot to - day , I have , "
48283	48288	48290	48290	Whittingham	881	" What 's that ? "
48292	48304	48290	48290	Whittingham	881	" Why that Winchester is Chichester , and Chichester is Winchester . "
48305	48312	48314	48315	the butler	26635	" They are two irrelevant cities , "
48317	48327	48314	48315	the butler	26635	" and not by no manner of means indentical . "
48328	48341	48343	48343	Snoggles	923	" The cities is different , but the men is the same , "
48345	48353	48343	48343	Snoggles	923	" I ca n't apprehend your meaning . "
48354	48383	48314	48315	the butler	26635	" Well — I will speak plain . Did you hear me tell Suggett the story about my old master , last night at the Servants ' Arms ? "
48384	48398	48343	48343	Snoggles	923	" No — I was engaged in a colloquial discourse at the time . "
48399	48409	48410	48411	Mr. Snoggles	923	" Then I will tell you the adventur ' over agin;"—and
48483	48501	48470	48470	he	874	" Ah ! Master Richard , I was sadly afraid that you had fallen into some trepidation ! "
48502	48536	48549	48550	the butler	26635	" A very unpleasant adventure , Whittingham — which I will relate to you another time — kept me away from home . I was with Sir Rupert Harborough and Mr. Chichester — — "
48537	48547	48549	48550	the butler	26635	" Mr. Chichester ai n't no good , sir , "
48553	48561	48549	48550	the butler	26635	" What do you mean , Whittingham ? "
48562	48589	48549	48550	the butler	26635	" I mean exactly what I say , Master Richard,—and nothing more nor less . Both the baronet and Mr. Chichester have been here this morning . "
48619	48625	48627	48627	Richard	874	" This is very extraordinary , "
48631	48644	48646	48646	Whittingham	881	" I ca n't say I ever regularly admired this Mr. Chichester , "
48648	48780	48646	48646	Whittingham	881	" He seems too dashing , too out - and - out , and too — too — circumwenting in his discourse , to be anythink exceeding and excessive good . Now I like the baronet much better ; he is n't so formiliar in his manners . Whenever he speaks to me he always says ' Mr. Whittingham ; ' but Mr. Chichester calls me plain ' Whittingham . ' As for that wulgar fellow Talbot , who has called here once or twice , he slaps me on the shoulder , and bawls out , ' Well , Whittingham , my tulip , how are you ? ' Now , you know , Master Richard , it 's not conformant to perceived notions to call a butler a tulip . "
48781	48797	48799	48799	Richard	874	" I have been deceived in my acquaintances — no doubt I have been deceived , "
48813	48895	48799	48799	Richard	874	" There is something suspicious in the connexion of that man Talbot — however rich he may be — with so elegant a gentleman as the baronet;—then this conduct of Chichester 's towards his servant — their taking me to a common gambling - house — their deserting me in the moment of need,—yes , I have been deceived ! And then , Diana — I ought never more to see her : her influence , her fascination are too dangerous ! "
48896	48902	48904	48904	Whittingham	881	" A gambling - house ! "
48914	48919	48921	48921	Richard	874	" My old friend , "
48929	49038	48921	48921	Richard	874	" I am afraid I have been enticed — inveigled into society which is not creditable to me or my position . I will repair my fault . Mr. Monroe , my guardian , advised me some weeks ago to indulge in a tour upon the continent : I will avail myself of this permission . At four o'clock I have an appointment — a pressing appointment to keep in town : by seven at latest I shall return . Have a post - chaise at the door and all things in readiness : we will proceed to Dover to - night . You alone shall accompany me . "
49039	49052	49054	49057	the faithful old dependant	3134	" Let 's do it , sir — let 's do it , "
49059	49085	49054	49057	the faithful old dependant	3134	" it will separate you from them flash fellows which lead young men into scrapes , and from them wulgar persons which call butlers tulips . "
49123	49225	49115	49116	Mrs. Arlington	891	" Circumstances of a very peculiar nature , and which I can not at present explain to you , compel me to quit London thus abruptly . I hope you will not imagine that I leave your agreeable society without many regrets . We shall probably meet again , when I may perhaps confide to you the motives of this sudden departure ; and you will then understand that I could not have remained in London another minute with safety to myself . I scarcely know what I write — I am so agitated and uneasy . Pray excuse this scrawl . "
49229	49247	49226	49227	RICHARD MARKHAM	874	" The second letter was to Mr. Monroe , and was couched in the following terms : — "
49365	49371	49372	49373	R. MARKHAM	947	" Ever your sincerely obliged , "
49375	49476	49372	49373	R. MARKHAM	947	" Having hastily folded , addressed , and sealed these letters , Markham hurried up to his bed - room to select certain articles of clothing and other necessaries which he should require upon his journey . He was interrupted in the middle of this occupation , by the entrance of Whittingham , who came to announce that two persons of somewhat strange and suspicious appearance desired an immediate interview with him . Scarcely was this message delivered , when the two men , who had followed Whittingham up - stairs , walked very unceremoniously into the bed - room . "
49485	49495	49479	49480	Richard Markham	874	" said one , advancing towards the young man . "
49512	49513	49501	49501	Markham	874	" "
49517	49528	49501	49501	Markham	874	" repeated the foremost of the ill - looking strangers . "
49563	49564	49555	49555	we	3140	" "

49631	49635	49628	49628	I	0	" demanded Richard . "

49668	49673	49655	49655	you	0	" demanded the officer . "

49840	49844	49833	49833	I	0	" said Richard , "
49864	49865	49859	49860	the magistrate	27233	" "
49873	49888	49889	49889	Jem	873	" returned the principal officer : then , addressing his companion , he said , "
49930	50293	49917	49917	you	873	" It was with great difficulty that Richard over - ruled the desire of Whittingham to accompany him ; but at length the faithful old man was induced to comprehend the necessity of staying behind , as an officer was about to exercise a strict search throughout the house , and Markham did not choose to leave his property to the mercy of a stranger . This point having been settled , Richard took his departure with the officer in whose custody he found himself . They entered the hackney - coach , which was waiting at a little distance , and immediately proceeded by the shortest cuts towards the chief office in Bow Street . Upon their arrival at that ominous establishment , Richard 's pocket - book and purse were taken away from him ; and he himself was thrust into a cell until the charge at that moment before the magistrate was disposed of . Here must we leave him for the present ; as during the night which followed his arrest , scenes of a terrible nature passed elsewhere . HOWEVER filthy , unhealthy , and repulsive the entire neighbourhood of West Street ( Smithfield ) , Field Lane , and Saffron Hill , may appear at the present day , it was far worse some years ago . There were then but few cesspools ; and scarcely any of those which did exist possessed any drains . The knackers ' yards of Cow Cross , and the establishments in Castle Street where horses ' flesh is boiled down to supply food for the dogs and cats of the metropolis , send forth now , as they did then , a fœtid and sickening odour which could not possibly be borne by a delicate stomach . At the windows of those establishments the bones of the animals are hung to bleach , and offend the eye as much as the horrible stench of the flesh acts repugnantly to the nerves . Upwards of sixty horses a day are frequently slaughtered in each yard ; and many of them are in the last stage of disease when sent to their "
50297	50307	49917	49917	you	873	" Should there not be a rapid demand for the "
50309	51105	51111	51111	dear	3158	" on the part of the itinerant purveyors of that article for canine and feline favourites , it speedily becomes putrid ; and a smell , which would alone appear sufficient to create a pestilence , pervades the neighbourhood . As if nothing should be wanting to render that district as filthy and unhealthy as possible , water is scarce . There is in this absence of a plentiful supply of that wholesome article , an actual apology for dirt . Some of the houses have small back yards , in which the inhabitants keep pigs . A short time ago , an infant belonging to a poor widow , who occupied a back room on the ground - floor of one of these hovels , died , and was laid upon the sacking of the bed while the mother went out to make arrangements for its interment . During her absence a pig entered the room from the yard , and feasted upon the dead child 's face ! In that densely populated neighbourhood that we are describing , hundreds of families each live and sleep in one room . When a member of one of these families happens to die , the corpse is kept in the close room where the rest still continue to live and sleep . Poverty frequently compels the unhappy relatives to keep the body for days — aye , and weeks . Rapid decomposition takes place — animal life generates quickly ; and in four - and - twenty hours myriads of loathsome animalculæ are seen crawling about . The very undertakers ' men fall sick at these disgusting — these revolting spectacles . The wealthy classes of society are far too ready to reproach the miserable poor for things which are really misfortunes and not faults . The habit of whole families sleeping together in one room destroys all sense of shame in the daughters : and what guardian then remains for their virtue ? But , alas ! a horrible — an odious crime often results from that poverty which thus huddles brothers and sisters , aunts and nephews , all together in one narrow room — the crime of incest ! When a disease — such as the small - pox or scarlatina — breaks out in one of those crowded houses , and in a densely populated neighbourhood , the consequences are frightful : the mortality is as rapid as that which follows the footsteps of the plague ! These are the fearful mysteries of that hideous district which exists in the very heart of this great metropolis . From St. John - street to Saffron Hill — from West - street to Clerkenwell Green , is a maze of narrow lanes , choked up with dirt , pestiferous with nauseous odours , and swarming with a population that is born , lives , and dies , amidst squalor , penury , wretchedness , and crime . Leading out of Holborn , between Field Lane and Ely Place , is Upper Union Court — a narrow lane forming a thoroughfare for only foot passengers . The houses in this court are dingy and gloomy : the sunbeams never linger long there ; and should an Italian - boy pass through the place , he does not stop to waste his music upon the inhabitants . The dwellings are chiefly let out in lodgings ; and through the open windows upon the ground - floor may occasionally be seen the half - starved families of mechanics crowding round the scantily - supplied table . A few of the lower casements are filled with children 's books , pictures of actors and highwaymen glaringly coloured , and lucifer - matches , twine , sweet - stuff , cotton , & c. At one door there stands an oyster - stall , when the comestible itself is in season : over another hangs a small board with a mangle painted upon it . Most of the windows on the ground - floors announce rooms to let , or lodgings for single men ; and perhaps a notice may be seen better written than the rest , that artificial - flower makers are required at that address . It was about nine o'clock in the evening when two little children — a boy of seven and a girl of five — walked slowly up this court , hand in hand , and crying bitterly . They were both clothed in rags , and had neither shoes nor stockings upon their feet . Every now and then they stopped , and the boy turned towards his little sister , and endeavoured to console her with kind words and kisses . "
51113	51117	51111	51111	dear	3158	" he said : "
51160	51297	51309	51311	a good girl	3162	" And the poor little fellow endeavoured to calm his own grief in order to appease the fears of his sister . Those children had now reached the door of the house in which their mother occupied an attic ; but they paused upon the step , evincing a mortal repugnance to proceed any farther . At length the little boy contrived by promises and caresses to hush the violence of his sister 's grief ; and they entered the house , the door of which stood open for the accommodation of the lodgers . Hand in hand these poor children ascended the dark and steep staircase , the boy whispering consolation in the girl 's ears . At length they reached the door of the attic : and there they stood for a few moments . "
51358	51494	51346	51346	mother	3159	" The boy kissed his sister once more , and then opened the attic - door . A man in a shabby black coat , and with an immense profusion of hair about his hang - dog countenance , was sitting on one side of a good fire , smoking a pipe . A thin , emaciated , but vixenish looking woman was arranging some food upon the table for supper . The entire furniture of the room consisted of that table , three broken chairs , and a filthy mattress in one corner . As soon as the boy opened the door , he seemed for a moment quite surprised to behold that man at the fireside : then , in another instant , he clapped his little hands joyously together , and exclaimed , "
51509	51510	51504	51504	father	3167	" "
51517	51541	51511	51511	Father	3167	" echoed the girl ; and the two children rushed up to their parent with the most pure — the most unfeigned delight . "
51549	51559	51560	51560	you	3171	" cried the man , brutally repulsing his children ; "
51567	51584	51560	51560	you	3171	" The boy fell back , abashed and dismayed : the little girl burst into tears . "
51592	51597	51560	51560	you	3171	" resumed the man ; "
51641	51642	51615	51615	she	3173	" "
51656	51666	51653	51654	Master Harry	949	" said the mother in a shrill menacing tone ; "
51684	51685	51688	51688	mother	3159	" "
51690	51703	51688	51688	mother	3159	" said the boy , slowly taking some halfpence from his pocket , "
51744	51786	51742	51742	Fanny	948	" As the boy uttered these words in a tremulous tone , and with tears trickling down his face , he got before his sister , in order to shield her , as it were , from his mother 's wrath . "
51794	51826	51791	51792	you fool	26592	" cried the woman , darting forward , and seizing hold of the boy 's hand containing the halfpence : then , having hastily glanced over the amount , she exclaimed , "
51856	51857	51844	51844	I	0	" "
51864	51869	51861	51861	he	3180	" demanded the man . "
51884	51890	51844	51844	I	0	" answered the woman indignantly . "
51916	52062	51904	51904	I	0	" The woman caught hold of the boy , and dealt him a tremendous blow upon the back with her thin bony fist . He fell upon his knees , and begged for mercy . His unnatural parent levelled a volley of abuse at him , mingled with oaths and filthy expressions , and then beat him — dashed him upon the floor — kicked him — all but stamped upon his poor body as he writhed at her feet . His screams were appalling . Then came the turn of the girl . The difference in the years of the children did not cause any with regard to their chastisement ; but while the unnatural mother dealt her heavy blows upon the head , neck , breast , and back of the poor little creature , the boy clasped his hands together , exclaiming , "
52083	52191	52069	52069	my	0	" Then forgetting his own pain , he threw himself before his sister to protect her — a noble act of self - devotion in so young a boy , and for which he only received additional punishment . At length the mother sate down exhausted ; and the poor lad drew his little sister into a corner , and endeavoured to soothe her . The husband of that vile woman had remained unmoved in his seat , quietly smoking his pipe , while this horrible scene took place ; and if he did not actually enjoy it , he was very far from disapproving of it . "
52194	52203	52069	52069	my	0	" said the woman , gasping for breath , "
52261	52262	52273	52276	A reg'lar knowing beggar	3189	" "
52267	52272	52273	52276	A reg'lar knowing beggar	3189	" growled the man . "
52320	52321	52316	52316	his	3189	" "
52326	52331	52316	52316	his	3189	" cried the woman : "
52408	52409	52380	52380	they	3192	" "
52422	52427	52412	52412	we	3196	" interrupted the man . "
52468	52469	52465	52465	Dick	872	" "
52476	52499	52474	52474	Bill	945	" answered the woman ; and throwing the children each a piece of bread , she added , in a cross tone , "
52531	52957	52521	52521	I	0	" The little boy gave the larger piece of bread to his sister ; and , having divested her of her rags , he made her as comfortable as he could on the filthy mattress , covering her over not only with her clothes but also with his own . He kissed her affectionately , but without making any noise with his lips , for fear that that should irritate his mother ; and then lay down beside her . Clasped in each other 's arms , those two children of poverty — the victims of horrible and daily cruelties — repulsed by a father whose neck they had longed to encircle with their little arms , and whose hand they had vainly sought to cover with kisses ; trembling even at the looks of a mother whom they loved in spite of all her harshness towards them , and from whose lips one word — one single word of kindness would have gladdened their poor hearts;—under such circumstances , we say , did these persecuted but affectionate infants , still smarting with the pain of cruel blows , and with tears upon their cheeks,—thus did they sink into slumber in each other 's arms ! Merciful God ! it makes the blood boil to think that this is no over - drawn picture — that there is no exaggeration in these details ; but that there really exist monsters in a human form — wearing often , too , the female shape — who make the infancy and early youth of their offspring one continued hell — one perpetual scene of blows , curses , and cruelties ! Oh ! for how many of our fellow - creatures have we to blush:—how many demons are there who have assumed our mortal appearance , who dwell amongst us , and who set us examples the most hideous — the most appalling ! As soon as the children were in bed , the woman went out , and returned in a few minutes with two pots of strong beer — purchased with the alms that day bestowed by the charitable upon her suffering offspring . She and her husband then partook of some cold meat , of which there was a plentiful provision — enough to have allowed the boy and the girl each a good slice of bread . And the bread which this man and this woman ate was new and good ; but the morsels thrown to the children were stale and mouldy . "
52963	52977	52958	52958	I	0	" said the woman , whispering in a mysterious tone to her husband , "
52990	52991	52994	52994	Polly	950	" "
53001	53006	52994	52994	Polly	950	" demanded the man . "
53009	53025	53026	53026	I	0	" resumed his wife , her countenance wearing an expression of demoniac cruelty and cunning , "
53078	53079	53082	53082	he	949	" "
53085	53094	53082	53082	he	949	" said Bill , with an approving nod . "

53198	53199	53195	53195	you	0	" "

53265	53270	53242	53242	she	948	" said Bill impatiently . "
53274	53284	53285	53285	she	948	" continued the woman , without heeding this question , "
53360	53361	53346	53346	she	948	" "
53370	53375	53366	53366	you	0	" demanded the man . "

53466	53471	53450	53450	I	0	" asked the man . "
53478	53505	53450	53450	I	0	" returned the woman . Her husband was a robber — yes , and a murderer : but he started when this proposal met his ear . "
53517	53523	53524	53524	I	0	" added the woman coolly . "
53531	53548	53524	53524	I	0	" she continued , after a pause , seeing that her husband did not answer her . "
53598	53599	53578	53578	she	951	" "
53607	53657	53658	53658	She	951	" asked the man , lighting his pipe , but not glancing towards his wife ; for although her words had made a deep impression upon him , he was yet struggling with the remnant of a parental feeling , which remained in his heart in spite of himself . "
53731	53732	53739	53739	you	0	" "
53741	53746	53739	53739	you	0	" demanded the man . "

53766	53790	53739	53739	you	0	" echoed Bill , who approved of the horrible scheme , but shuddered at the cruelty of it , villain as he was . "

53858	53873	53847	53847	I	0	" The conversation was interrupted by a low knock at the attic - door . "

54140	54163	54116	54116	He	873	" said Dick Flairer , after a pause , during which he lighted his pipe and paid his respects to the beer , "

54220	54225	54198	54198	My	0	" returned Bill Bolter . "

54285	54289	54273	54273	you	3229	" said Dick . "
54334	54363	54366	54366	Dick	872	" Dick Flairer had turned deadly pale at the mention of this circumstance : his knees shook ; and he cast an uneasy and rapid glance around him . "
54373	54378	54366	54366	Dick	872	" said the woman : "
54392	54393	54390	54390	you	872	" "
54396	54434	54435	54435	Bill	871	" he exclaimed , with a convulsive start ; then , after a moment 's silence , during which his two companions surveyed him with curiosity and fear , he added in a low and subdued tone , "
54508	54509	54499	54500	that man	3239	" "
54517	54529	54499	54500	that man	3239	" cried Bolter , looking uneasily around him in his turn . "

54697	54701	54695	54695	Dick	872	" demanded Bill . "
54709	54714	54695	54695	Dick	872	" exclaimed the woman . "
54720	54726	54727	54727	I	0	" said Dick very seriously . "

54873	54935	54865	54865	I	0	" cried Dick solemnly , striking his hand upon the table at the same time . There was a long pause . Even the woman , who was perhaps more hardened in vice and more inaccessible to anything in the shape of sentiment than her male companions , seemed impressed by the positive manner in which the man told his story . "
54945	54956	54865	54865	I	0	" ejaculated Dick , after the lapse of some minutes . "
54970	54971	54865	54865	I	0	" "
54981	54985	54996	54996	he	3251	" returned Bill ; "

55044	55048	55049	55051	the eldest son	3256	" said Dick ; "

55196	55202	55194	55194	Servants	3265	" said Bill , interrogatively . "
55218	55222	55211	55216	two women — three in all	3268	" replied Dick . "
55227	55234	55211	55216	two women — three in all	3268	" observed the woman , approvingly . "
55243	55247	55239	55240	the Cracksman	3270	" demanded Bill . "
55309	55310	55311	55311	I	0	" "
55316	55655	55311	55311	I	0	" said Bill ; and the two thieves left the room together . At the top of Union Court is Bleeding Hart Yard , leading to Kirby Street , at right angles to which is a narrow alley terminating on Great Saffron Hill . This was the road the burglars took . It was now eleven o'clock , and a thick fog — so dense that it seemed as if it could be cut with a knife — prevailed . The men kept close together , for they could not see a yard before them . Here and there lights glimmered in the miserable casements ; and the fog , thus faintly illuminated at intervals , appeared of a dingy copper colour . The burglars proceeded along Saffron Hill . The streets were nearly empty ; but now and then the pale , squalid , and nameless forms of vice were heard at the door - ways of a few houses , endeavouring to lure the passers - by into their noisome abodes . A great portion of the unwholesome life of that district had sought relief from the pangs of misery and the remorse of crime , in sleep . Alas ! the slumbers of the poor and of the guilty are haunted by the lean , lank , and gaunt visages of penury , and all the fearful escort of turpitude ! Through the broken shutters of several windows came the sounds of horrible revelry — ribald and revolting ; and from others issued cries , shrieks , oaths , and the sounds of heavy blows — a sad evidence of the brutality of drunken quarrels . Numerous Irish families are crowded together in the small back rooms of the houses on Saffron Hill ; and the husbands and fathers gorge themselves , at the expense of broken - hearted wives and famishing children , with the horrible compound of spirit and vitriol , sold at the low gin - shops in the neighbourhood . Hosts of "
55658	55912	55311	55311	I	0	" also congregate in that locality ; and the screams of the unfortunate boys , who writhe beneath the lash of their furious employers on their return home after an unsuccessful day with their organs , monkies , white mice , or chalk images , mingle with the other appalling or disgusting sounds , which make night in that district truly hideous . Even at the late hour at which the two burglars were wending their way over Saffron Hill , boys of ages ranging from seven to fifteen , were lurking in the courts and alleys , watching for any decently dressed persons , who might happen to pass that way . Those boys had for the most part been seduced from the control of their parents by the receivers of stolen goods in Field Lane , or else had been sent into the streets to thieve by those vile parents themselves . Thus , as the hulks , the convict - ships , the penitentiaries , and the gallows , relieve society of one generation of villains , another is springing up to occupy the vacancy . And this will always be the case so long as laws tend only to punish — and aim not to reform . Dick Flairer and Bill Bolter proceeded , without exchanging many words together , through the dense fog , until they reached a low public - house , which they entered . Nothing could be more filthy nor revolting than the interior of this "
55917	56042	56043	56043	Paddy	959	" Sweeps , costermongers , Jews , Irish bricklayers , and women of the town were crowding round the bar , drinking various malt and spirituous liquors fearfully adulterated . The beer , having been originally deluged with water to increase the quantity , had been strengthened by drugs of most deleterious qualities — such as tobacco - juice and cocculus - indicus . The former is a poison as subtle as that of a viper : the latter is a berry of such venomous properties , that if thrown into a pond , it will speedily send the fish up to the surface to gasp and die . The gin was mixed with vitriol , as hinted above ; and the whiskey , called "
56049	56111	56043	56043	Paddy	959	" with spirits of turpentine . The pots and glasses in which the various beverages were served up , were all stood upon double trays , with a cavity between , and numerous holes in the upper surface . The overflowings and drainings were thus caught and saved ; and the landlord dispensed the precious compound , which bore the name of "
56115	56151	56043	56043	Paddy	959	" at a halfpenny a glass . The two burglars nodded familiarly to the landlord and his wife , as they passed the bar , and entered a little , low , smoky room , denominated "
56155	56370	56373	56373	his	3275	" A tremendous fire burnt in the grate , at which a short , thin , dark man , with a most forbidding countenance , was sitting , agreeably occupied in toasting a sausage . The right hand of this man had lost the two middle fingers , the stumps of which were still covered with plaster , as if the injury had been recent . He was dressed in a complete suit of corduroy : the sleeves of his jacket , the lower part of his waistcoat , and the front of his trousers , were covered with grease . On the table near him stood a huge piece of bread and a pot of beer . This individual was Tom the Cracksman — the most adroit and noted burglar in the metropolis . He kept a complete list of all the gentlemen 's houses in the environs of London , with the numbers of servants and male inhabitants in each . He never attempted any dwelling within a circuit of three miles of the General Post Office : his avocation was invariably exercised in the suburbs of London , where the interference of the police was less probable . At the moment when we introduce him to our readers , he was somewhat "
56376	56412	56373	56373	his	3275	" as he himself expressed it , the accident which had happened to his hand , through playing with gunpowder , having completely disabled him for the preceding two months , and the landlord of the "
56416	56452	56373	56373	his	3275	" having made it an invariable rule never to give credit . Thus , though the Cracksman had spent hundreds of pounds in that house , he could not obtain so much as a glass of "
56455	56525	56565	56565	they	3277	" without the money . The Cracksman was alone in the parlour when Dick Flairer and Bill Bolter entered . Having toasted his sausage , the renowned burglar placed it upon the bread , and began eating his supper by means of a formidable clasp - knife , without deigning to cast a glance around . At length Bill Bolter burst out into a loud laugh , and exclaimed , "
56547	56548	56539	56539	you	954	" "
56557	56562	56551	56551	Bill	871	" ejaculated the burglar . "

56711	56716	56704	56704	We	3280	" observed Dick Flairer . "
56731	56732	56736	56736	them	3283	" "
56747	56753	56736	56736	them	3283	" returned the Cracksman bitterly . "

56844	56848	56811	56811	You	3287	" said Dick : "

56863	56868	56849	56849	we	3280	" demanded the Cracksman . "
56874	56878	56849	56849	we	3280	" cried Dick : "

56991	56995	56968	56968	you	3287	" answered Bill . "
56998	57003	56968	56968	you	3287	" resumed the Cracksman , "

57094	57099	57078	57079	Ben Price	960	" said Dick Flairer . "

57121	57125	57126	57126	We	3280	" added Bill . "
57149	57154	57126	57126	We	3280	" exclaimed the Cracksman . "

57178	57182	57183	57183	I	0	" said Dick . "
57202	57225	57183	57183	I	0	" The burglar went out to the bar , and returned with some brandy , which he and his companions drank pure . "
57233	57242	57228	57228	Jem	873	" observed the Cracksman , after a pause . "
57264	57265	57252	57252	he	873	" "
57279	57284	57276	57276	I	0	" said the Cracksman . "

57798	57802	57779	57781	the old nurse	3324	" demanded Dick . "
57810	57815	57779	57781	the old nurse	3324	" resumed the Cracksman . "
58069	58070	58058	58059	Mac Chizzle	919	" "
58077	58082	58072	58072	I	0	" exclaimed Dick Flairer . "
58566	58567	58543	58544	Mac Chizzle	919	" "
58584	58599	58580	58580	I	0	" ejaculated Dick , when the Cracksman had brought his tale to an end . "
58604	58612	58580	58580	I	0	" added Bill . The parlour of the "
58616	58759	58580	58580	I	0	" now received some additional guests — all belonging to the profession of roguery , though not all following precisely the same line . Thus there were Cracksmen , Magsmen , Area - Sneaks , Public Patterers , Buzgloaks , Dummy - Hunters , Compter - Prigs , Smashers , Flimsy - Kiddies , Macers,[47 ] Coiners , Begging - Letter Impostors , & c. , & c. The orgies of that motley crew soon became uproarious and revolting . Those who had money lavished it with the most reckless profusion ; and thus those who had none were far from being in want of liquor . The Cracksman was evidently a great man amongst this horrible fraternity : his stories and songs invariably commanded attention . It is not our purpose to detain the reader much longer in the parlour of the "
58764	58812	58580	58580	I	0	" we have doubtless narrated enough in this and the preceding chapter to give him a faint idea of some of the horrors of London . We can not , however , allow the morning scene to pass unnoticed . THE orgie lasted throughout the night in the "
58817	58928	58580	58580	I	0	" There were plenty of kind guests who , being flush of money , treated those that had none ; and thus Tom the Cracksman , Dick Flairer , and Bill Bolter , were enabled to indulge , to their heart 's content , in the adulterated liquors sold at the establishment . The cold raw November morning was ushered in with a fine mizzling rain . The gas - lights were extinguished in the parlour ; and the dawn of day fell upon countenances inflamed with debauchery , and rendered hideous by dirt and dark bristling beards . That was a busy hour for the landlord and landlady of the "
58933	58937	58580	58580	I	0	" The neighbours who "
58942	58957	58580	58580	I	0	" came in , one after another — male and female , to take their "
58960	58972	58580	58580	I	0	" This signified their first dram . Then was it that the "
58975	59276	58580	58580	I	0	" was in great demand . Old clothesmen , sweeps , dustmen , knackers , crimps , and women of the town , crowded round the bar , imbibing the strange but potent compound . Even young boys and girls of tender age seemed as a matter of course to require the morning stimulant ere they commenced the avocations or business of the day . Matted hair , blear - eyes , grimy faces , pestiferous breaths , and hollow cheeks , combined with rags and tatters , were the characteristics of the wretches that thronged about the bar of that lowest of low drinking - dens . Nothing is more revolting to the eye than the unwashed aspect of dissipation by the dingy light of the early dawn . The women had evidently jumped from their beds and huddled on their miserable attire without the slightest regard to decency , in order to lose no time in obtaining their morning dram . The men appeared as if they had slept in their clothes all night ; and the pieces of straw in the coarse matted hair of many of them , plainly denoted of what materials their beds were made . They all entered shivering , cold , depressed , and sullen . The dram instantly produced an extraordinary change in each . Artificial gaiety — a gaiety which developed itself in ribald jokes , profane oaths , and obscene talk — was diffused around . Those who could afford it indulged in a second and a third glass ; and some tossed for pots of beer . The men lighted their pipes ; and the place was impregnated with the narcotic fumes of the strongest and worst tobacco — that bastard opium of the poor . Presently the policeman "
59280	59295	58580	58580	I	0	" lounged in , and was complimented by the landlady with a glass of her "
59300	59332	58580	58580	I	0	" He seemed well acquainted with many of the individuals there , and laughed heartily at the jokes uttered in his presence . When he was gone , the inmates of the "
59336	59344	58580	58580	I	0	" all declared , with one accord , "
59360	59719	59346	59346	he	3380	" In the parlour there were several men occupied in warming beer , toasting herrings , and frying sausages . The tables were smeared over with a rag as black as a hat , by a dirty slip - shod drab of a girl ; and with the same cloth she dusted the frame of wire - work which protected the dingy face of the huge Dutch clock . Totally regardless of her presence , the men continued their obscene and filthy discourse ; and she proceeded with her work as coolly as if nothing offensive met her ears . There are , thank God ! thousands of British women who constitute the glory of their sex — chaste , virtuous , delicate - minded , and pure in thought and action,—beings who are but one remove from angels now , but who will be angels hereafter when they succeed to their inheritance of immortality . It must be to such as these that the eyes of the poet are turned when he eulogises , in glowing and impassioned language , the entire sex comprehended under the bewitching name of Woman ! For , oh ! how would his mind be shocked , were he to wander for a few hours amidst those haunts of vice and sinks of depravity which we have just described;—his spirit , towering on eagle - wing up into the sunny skies of poesy , would flutter back again to the earth , at the aspect of those foul and loathsome wretches , who , in the female shape , are found in the dwelling - places of poverty and crime ! But to continue . Bill Bolter took leave of his companions at about eight o'clock in the morning , after a night of boisterous revelry ; and rapidly retraced his steps homewards . Field Lane was now swarming with life . The miserable little shops were all open ; and their proprietors were busy in displaying their commodities to the best advantage . Here Jewesses were occupied in suspending innumerable silk handkerchiefs to wires and poles over their doors : there the "
59721	59789	60377	60377	I	0	" of old shoes were employed in spreading their stock upon the shelves that filled the place where the windows ought to have been . In one or two low dark shops women were engaged in arranging herrings , stock - fish , and dried haddocks : in another , coals , vegetables , and oysters were exposed for sale ; and not a few were hung with "
59797	59876	60377	60377	I	0	" To this we may add that in the centre of the great metropolis of the mightiest empire in the world — in a city possessing a police which annually costs the nation thousands of pounds — and in a country whose laws are vaunted as being adapted to reach and baffle all degrees of crime — numbers of receivers of stolen goods were boldly , safely , and tranquilly exposing for sale the articles which their agents had "
59879	59951	59346	59346	he	3380	" during the preceding night . There was , however , nothing in the aspect of Field Lane at all new to the eyes of Bill Bolter . Indeed he merely went down that Jew 's bazaar , in his way homewards , because he was anxious to purchase certain luxuries in the shape of red - herrings for his breakfast , he having borrowed a trifle of a friend at the "
59955	60001	59346	59346	he	3380	" to supply his immediate necessities . When he arrived at his lodgings in Lower Union Court , he was assailed with a storm of reproaches , menaces , and curses , on the part of his wife , for having stayed all night at the "
60005	60372	59346	59346	he	3380	" At first that cruel and remorseless man trembled — actually turned pale and trembled in the presence of the virago who thus attacked him . But at length his passion was aroused by her taunts and threats ; and , after bandying some horrible abuse and foul epithets with the infuriate woman , he was provoked to blows . With one stroke of his enormous fist , he felled her to the ground , and then brutally kicked her as she lay almost senseless at his feet . He then coolly sate down by the fire to cook his own breakfast , without paying the least attention to the two poor children , who were crying bitterly in that corner of the room where they had slept . In a few minutes the woman rose painfully from the floor . Her features were distorted and her lips were livid with rage . She dared not , however , attempt to irritate her furious husband any farther : still her passion required a vent . She looked round , and seemed to reflect for a moment . Then , in the next instant , all her concentrated rage burst upon the heads of her unhappy offspring . With a horrible curse at their squalling , the woman leapt , like a tiger - cat , upon the poor little boy and girl . Harry , as usual , covered his sister with his own thin and emaciated form as well as he could ; and a torrent of blows rained down upon his naked flesh . The punishment which that maddened wretch thus inflicted upon him , was horrible in the extreme . A thousand times before that day had Polly Bolter treated her children with demoniac cruelty ; and her husband had not attempted to interfere . On the present occasion , however , he took it into his head to meddle in the matter — for the simple reason that , having quarrelled with his wife , he hated her at the moment , and greedily availed himself of any opportunity to thwart or oppose her . Starting from his chair , he exclaimed , "
60393	60394	60385	60385	They	27595	" "
60401	60445	60446	60446	I	0	" returned the woman , desisting for an instant from her attack upon the boy , and casting a look of mingled defiance and contempt at her husband . That woman 's countenance , naturally ugly and revolting , was now absolutely frightful . "
60454	60458	60446	60446	I	0	" cried Bill . "
60472	60473	60465	60465	I	0	" "
60511	60512	60504	60504	you	0	" "
60551	60552	60544	60544	I	0	" "
60565	61042	60563	60563	you	0	" and she dealt a tremendous blow upon her boy 's shoulder . The poor lad screamed piteously : the hand of his mother had fallen with the weight of a sledge hammer upon his naked flesh . But that ferocious blow was echoed by another , at scarcely a moment 's interval . The latter was dealt by the fist of Bill Bolter , and fell upon the back part of the ruthless mother 's head with stunning force . The woman fell forward , and struck her face violently against the corner of the deal table . Her left eye came in contact with the angle of the board , and was literally crushed in its socket — an awful retribution upon her who only a few hours before was planning how to plunge her innocent and helpless daughter into the eternal night of blindness . She fell upon the floor , and a low moan escaped her lips . She endeavoured to carry her right hand to her now sightless eye ; but her strength failed her , and her arm fell lifeless by her side . She was dying . The man was now alarmed , and hastened to raise her up . The children were struck dumb with unknown fears , and clasped each other in their little arms . The woman recovered sufficient consciousness , during the two or three seconds which preceded the exhalation of her last breath , to glance with her remaining eye up into her husband 's face . She could not , however , utter an articulate sound — not even another moan . But no pen could depict , and no words describe , the deadly — the malignant — the fiendish hatred which animated her countenance as she thus met her husband 's gaze . The tigress , enveloped in the folds of the boa - constrictor , never darted such a glance of impotent but profound and concentrated rage upon the serpent that held it powerless in its fatal clasp . She expired with her features still distorted by that horrible expression of vindictive spite . A few moments elapsed before the man was aware that his wife was dead — that he had murdered her ! He supported her mechanically , as it were ; for he was dismayed and appalled by the savage aspect which her countenance had assumed — that countenance which was rendered the more hideous by the bleeding eye - ball crushed in its socket . At length he perceived that she was no more ; and , with a terrible oath , he let her head drop upon the floor . For a minute he stood and contemplated the corpse:—a whirlwind was in his brain . The voices of his children aroused him from his reverie . "
61052	61064	61065	61065	Mother	966	" asked the boy , in a timid and subdued tone . "
61070	61074	61075	61076	poor mother	3391	" said Fanny : "
61078	61079	61068	61068	herself	966	" "
61088	61093	61086	61086	father	3167	" added the boy : "
61108	61109	61099	61099	I	0	" "
61112	61131	61099	61099	I	0	" ejaculated the murderer : and , after another minute 's hesitation , he hurried to the door . "
61149	61162	61099	61099	I	0	" cried the little boy , bursting into an agony of tears : "
61177	61191	61173	61173	mother	3159	" added he with a glance of horror and apprehension towards the corpse : "
61232	61317	61321	61321	boy	3400	" With profound anguish in his heart , the little fellow clung to his father 's knees , and proffered his prayer in a manner the most ingenuous — the most touching . The man paused , as if he knew not what to do . His hesitation lasted but a moment . Disengaging himself from the arms of his child , he said in as kind a tone as he could assume — and that tone was kinder than any he had ever used before—"Don't
61345	61346	61338	61338	I	0	" "
61357	61944	61355	61355	father	3167	" returned the boy , clasping his little hands imploringly together . In another moment the two children were alone with the corpse of their mother ; while the murderer was rapidly descending the stairs to escape from the contemplation of that scene of horror . AGAIN the scene changes . Our readers must accompany us once more to the villa in the neighbourhood of Upper Clapton . It was the evening of the day on which was perpetrated the dreadful deed related in the preceding chapter . The curtains were drawn over the dining - room windows ; a cheerful fire burned in the grate ; and a lamp , placed in the middle of the table , diffused a pleasant and mellowed light around . An air of comfort , almost amounting to luxury , pervaded that apartment ; and its general temperature was the better appreciated , as the wind whistled without , and the rain pattered against the windows . At the table , on which stood a dessert of delicious fruits , conserves , cakes , and wines , sate Walter Sydney and George Montague . They had now been acquainted nearly three months ; and during that period they had met often . Montague had , however , seldom called at the villa , save when expressly invited by his friend Stephens : still , upon those occasions , he and Walter were frequently alone for some time together . Thus , while Stephens was examining into the economy of the stables , or superintending improvements in the garden , Montague and that mysterious lady in man 's attire , were thrown upon their own resources to entertain each other . The reader can not be surprised if an attachment sprung up between them . So far as that lovely woman was concerned , we can vouch that her predilection towards George Montague was the sincere and pure sentiment of a generous and affectionate heart . How worthy of such a passion his own feelings on the subject might have been , must appear hereafter . The masculine attire and habits which the lady had assumed , had not destroyed the fine and endearing characteristics of her woman 's heart . She was at first struck by Montague 's handsome person;—then his varied conversation delighted her;—and , as he soon exerted all his powers to render himself agreeable to the heroine of the villa , it was not long before he completely won her heart . The peculiarity of her position had taught her — and necessarily so — to exercise an almost complete command over the expression of her feelings . Thus , though an explanation had taken place between herself and Montague , and a mutual avowal of affection made , Stephens remained without a suspicion upon the subject . On the evening when we again introduce our readers to the villa , Montague was there by the express desire of Mr. Stephens ; but this latter individual had been detained by particular business elsewhere . Walter — for so we must continue to call that mysterious being — and Montague had therefore dined tête - à - tête ; and they were now enjoying together the two or three pleasant hours which succeed the most important meal of the day . The plans of the lovers will be comprehended by means of the ensuing conversation , better than if drily detailed in our own narrative style : — "
61953	61958	61355	61355	father	3167	" said the lady , "
61969	61970	61355	61355	father	3167	" "
61976	61980	61355	61355	father	3167	" echoed Montague ; "
61997	61998	61999	61999	My	0	" "
62015	62022	61999	61999	My	0	" observed the lady , mournfully . "
62028	62032	61999	61999	My	0	" ejaculated Montague . "
62058	62059	62038	62038	I	0	" "
62097	62098	62102	62102	I	0	" "
62155	62156	62209	62209	he	899	" "
62166	62185	62209	62209	he	899	" ejaculated the lady , her bosom heaving with pleasurable emotions beneath the tight frock which confined it . "
62234	62235	62209	62209	he	899	" "
62244	62249	62250	62250	He	899	" cried Montague emphatically . "
62268	62269	62270	62270	He	899	" "
62276	62283	62285	62285	he	899	" said the lady , reproachfully ; "
62291	62292	62285	62285	he	899	" "
62300	62301	62294	62294	I	0	" "
62465	62466	62467	62467	You	0	" "
62471	62475	62476	62476	Stephens	899	" said Montague . "
62483	62484	62476	62476	Stephens	899	" "
62495	62499	62490	62490	I	0	" continued Walter , "
62542	62543	62490	62490	I	0	" "
62561	62565	62490	62490	I	0	" added Montague , "
62645	62646	62649	62649	George	903	" "
62654	62666	62649	62649	George	903	" cried the lady , with a smile and a blush . "
62698	62743	62744	62744	George	903	" The time - piece upon the mantel struck eleven ; and Montague rose to depart . It was an awful night . The violence of the wind had increased during the last hour ; and the rain poured in torrents against the windows . "
62760	62772	62773	62773	one	2053	" said the lady , in a frank and ingenuous manner : "
62807	62994	62995	62995	You	3419	" Walter rang the bell , and gave Louisa the necessary instructions . In another half - hour Montague was conducted to the apartment provided for him , and Walter retired to the luxurious and elegant boudoir which we have before described . The satin curtains were drawn over the casement against which the rain beat with increasing fury : a cheerful fire actually roared in the grate ; and the thick carpet upon the floor , the inviting lounging - chair close by the hearth , and the downy couch with its snow - white sheets and warm clothing , completed the air of comfort which prevailed in that delicious retreat . The vases of sweet flowers were no longer there , it was true ; but a fragrant odour of bergamot and lavender filled the boudoir . Nothing could be more charming than this warm , perfumed , and voluptuous chamber — worthy of the lovely and mysterious being who seemed the presiding divinity of that elysian bower . Walter threw herself into the easy - chair , and dismissed her attendant , saying , "
63048	63181	63404	63406	Bill — Dick	968	" Louisa withdrew , and Walter then plunged into a delicious reverie . The approaching emancipation from the thraldom of an assumed sex — her affection for George Montague — and the anticipated possession of an ample fortune to guard against the future , were golden visions not the less dazzling for being waking ones . Half an hour had passed away in this manner , when a strange noise startled Walter in the midst of her meditations . She thought that she heard a shutter close violently and a pane of glass smash to pieces almost at the same moment . Alarm was for an instant depicted upon her countenance : she then smiled , and , ashamed of the evanescent fear to which she had yielded , said to herself , "
63204	63401	63404	63406	Bill — Dick	968	" Taking the lamp in her hand she issued from the boudoir , and hastily descended the stairs leading to the ground floor . In her way thither she could hear , even amidst the howling of the wind , the loud barking of the dogs in the rear of the villa . The hall , as she crossed it , struck piercing cold , after the genial warmth of the boudoir which she had just left . She cautiously entered the parlour on the left hand of the front door : all was safe . Having satisfied herself that the shutters in that apartment were securely closed and fastened , she proceeded to the dining - room . She opened the door , and was about to cross the threshold , when — at that moment — the lamp was dashed from her hand by some one inside the room ; and she herself was instantly seized by two powerful arms , and dragged into the apartment . A piercing cry issued from her lips ; and then a coarse and hard hand was pressed violently on her mouth . Further utterance was thus stopped . "
63408	63414	63404	63406	Bill — Dick	968	" said a gruff voice ; "
63440	63441	63404	63406	Bill — Dick	968	" "
63450	63464	63404	63406	Bill — Dick	968	" returned another voice , hastily , and with an accent of horror . "
63485	63486	63490	63490	him	3423	" "
63496	63502	63490	63490	him	3423	" cried a third voice . "
63513	63514	63511	63511	Bill	968	" "
63530	63545	63528	63528	Dick	968	" said the first speaker , who was no other than Tom the Cracksman . "
63562	63648	63552	63552	I	0	" Scarcely had these words issued from the lips of the burglar , when the door was thrown open , and Montague entered the room . He held a lamp in one hand , and a pistol in the other ; and it was easy to perceive that he had been alarmed in the midst of his repose , for he had nothing on save his trousers and his shirt . On the sudden appearance of an individual thus armed , Tom the Cracksman exclaimed , "
63664	63701	63656	63656	We	3427	" The light of the lamp , which Montague held in his hand , streamed full upon the countenance and person of Walter Sydney , who was struggling violently in the suffocating grasp of the Cracksman . "
63706	64052	64057	64057	I	0	" ejaculated Dick Flairer , dropping his dark lantern and a bunch of skeleton keys upon the floor , while his face was suddenly distorted with an expression of indescribable horror ; then , in obedience to the natural impulse of his alarm , he rushed towards the window , the shutters and casement of which had been forced open , leapt through it , and disappeared amidst the darkness of the night . Astonished by this strange event , Bill Bolter instantly turned his eyes from Montague , whom he was at that moment about to attack , towards the Cracksman and Walter Sydney . The colour fled from the murderer 's cheeks , as if a sudden spell had fallen upon him : his teeth chattered — his knees trembled — and he leant against the table for support . There was the identical being whom four years and five months before , they had hurled down the trap - door of the old house in Chick Lane:—and who , that had ever met that fate as yet , had survived to tell the tale ? For an instant the entire frame of the murderer was convulsed with alarm : the apparition before him — the vision of his assassinated wife — and the reminiscences of other deeds of the darkest dye , came upon him with the force of a whirlwind . For an instant , we say , was he convulsed with alarm;—in another moment he yielded to his fears , and , profiting by his companion 's example , disappeared like an arrow through the window . Amongst persons engaged in criminal pursuits , a panic - terror is very catching . The Cracksman — formidable and daring as he was — suddenly experienced an unknown and vague fear , when he perceived the horror and unassumed alarm which had taken possession of his comrades . He loosened his grasp upon his intended victim : Walter made a last desperate effort , and released himself from the burglar 's power . "
64064	64462	64057	64057	I	0	" cried Montague , pointing his pistol at the Cracksman . Scarcely were these words uttered , when the burglar darted forward , dashed the lamp from the hands of Montague , and effected his escape by the window . Montague rushed to the casement , and snapped the pistol after him : the weapon only flashed in the pan . Montague closed the window and fastened the shutters . He then called Walter by name ; and , receiving no answer , groped his way in the dark towards the door . His feet encountered an obstacle upon the carpet : he stooped down and felt with his hands;—Walter Sydney had fainted . Scarcely two minutes had elapsed since Montague had entered the room ; for the confusion and flight of the burglars had not occupied near so much time to enact as to describe . The entire scene had moreover passed without any noise calculated to disturb the household . There were consequently no servants at hand to afford Walter the succour which he required . For a moment Montague hesitated what course to pursue ; but , after one instant 's reflection , he took her in his arms , and carried her up into her own enchanting and delicious boudoir . GEORGE Montague placed his precious burden upon the bed , and for a moment contemplated her pale but beautiful countenance with mingled feelings of admiration , interest , and desire . The lips were apart , and two rows of pearl glittered beneath . The luxuriant light chesnut hair rolled over his arm , on which he still supported that head of perfect loveliness : his hand thus played with those silken , shining tresses . Still she remained motionless — lifeless . Gently withdrawing his arm , Montague hastened to sprinkle her countenance with water . The colour returned faintly , very faintly to her cheeks ; and her lips moved gently ; but she opened not her eyes . For a moment he thought of summoning Louisa to her assistance ; then , obedient to a second impulse , he hastily loosened the hooks of her semi - military frock - coat . Scarcely had his hand thus invaded the treasures of her bosom , when she moved , and unclosed the lids of her large melting hazel - eyes . "
64467	64479	64465	64465	I	0	" she exclaimed , instinctively closing her coat over her breast . "
64485	64489	64492	64492	I	0	" whispered Montague ; "
64499	64523	64494	64494	I	0	" The scene with the burglars instantly flashed to the mind of the lady ; and she cried in a tone rendered tremulous by fear—"And
64534	64535	64524	64526	those horrible men	3429	" "
64545	64546	64549	64549	you	0	" "
64556	64569	64549	64549	you	0	" continued Walter , hastily moving from the bed to a chair ; "
64601	64602	64604	64604	their	3429	" "
64615	64619	64611	64611	they	3429	" exclaimed Montague : "
64648	64649	64651	64651	you	0	" "
64655	64665	64651	64651	you	0	" said the lady , glancing tenderly toward the young man—"you
64702	64722	64723	64723	I	0	" She tendered him her hand , which he pressed rapturously to his lips;—and she did not withdraw it . "
64741	64745	64746	64746	I	0	" said Montague : "
64767	64768	64759	64759	I	0	" "
64777	64781	64771	64771	mine	3435	" interrupted Walter ; "
64791	64792	64783	64783	I	0	" "
64806	64810	64798	64798	I	0	" added Montague , "
64826	64827	64828	64828	You	0	" "
64850	64956	64845	64845	I	0	" Again did Montague press the fair hand of that enchanting woman to his lips ; and then , as he leant over her , their eyes met , and they exchanged glances of love — hers pure and chaste , his ardent and brimful of desire . He was maddened — he was emboldened by those innocent tokens of affection upon her part ; and , throwing his arms around her , he imprinted hot and burning kisses upon her lips . With difficulty did she disengage herself from his embrace ; and she cast upon him a look of reproach mingled with melancholy . "
64963	64979	64845	64845	I	0	" he exclaimed , seizing her hand once more and pressing it to his lips ; "
64993	64994	64997	64997	George	903	" "
65046	65053	65059	65059	Louisa	900	" she added with a blush , "
65067	65068	65059	65059	Louisa	900	" "
65075	65079	65059	65059	Louisa	900	" returned Montague ; "
65094	65095	65091	65092	beloved one	3442	" "
65102	65820	65091	65092	beloved one	3442	" said the lady;—and in another moment she was again alone in the boudoir . Montague returned to his apartment , full of the bliss which he had derived from the caresses enjoyed in a chamber that seemed sacred to mystery and love . He paced his own room with hasty and agitated steps : his brain was on fire . His own loose ideas of morality induced him to put but little faith in the reality of female virtue . He moreover persuaded himself that the principles of rectitude — supposing that they had ever existed — in the bosom of the enchanting creature he had just left , had been undermined or destroyed by the cheat which she was practising with regard to her sex . And , lastly , he fancied that her affections were too firmly rivetted on him to refuse him anything . Miserable wretch ! he was blinded by his own mad desires . He knew not that woman 's virtue is as real , as pure , and as precious as the diamond ; he remembered not that the object of his licentious passion was innocent of aught criminal in the disguise which she had assumed;—he reflected not that the caresses which she had ere now permitted him to snatch , were those which the most spotless virgin may honourably award to her lover . He paced his room in a frenzied manner — allowing his imagination to picture scenes and enjoyments of the most voluptuous kind . By degrees his passion became ungovernable : he was no longer the cool , calculating man he hitherto had been;—a new chord appeared to have been touched in his heart . At that moment he would have signed a bond , yielding up all hopes of eternal salvation to the Evil One , for a single hour of love in the arms of that woman whom he had left in the boudoir ! His passion had become a delirium:—he would have plunged into the crater of Vesuvius , or thrown himself from the ridge of the Alpine mountain into the boiling torrent beneath , had she gone before him . An hour thus passed away , and he attempted not to subdue his feelings : he rather encouraged their wild and wayward course by recalling to his imagination the charms of her whose beauty had thus strangely affected him,—the endearing words which she had uttered,—the thrilling effect of the delicious kisses he had received from her moist vermilion lips,—and the voluptuous contours of that snowy bosom which had been for a moment revealed to his eyes . An hour passed : he opened the door of his chamber and listened . A dead silence prevailed throughout the house . He stole softly along the passage and through the anteroom which led to the boudoir . When he reached the door of that chamber he paused for a moment . What was he about to do ? He waited not to answer the question , nor to reason within himself : he only chose to remember that a thin partition was all that separated him from one of the most beauteous creatures upon whom the sun ever shone in this world . His fingers grasped the handle of the door : he turned it gently;—the door was not locked ! He entered the boudoir as noiselessly as a spectre . The lamp was extinguished ; but the fire still burnt in the grate ; and its flickering light played tremulously on the various objects around , bathing in a rich red glare the downy bed whereon reposed the heroine of the villa . The atmosphere was warm and perfumed . The head of the sleeper was supported upon one naked arm , which was round , polished , and of exquisite whiteness . The other lay outside the clothes , upon the coverlid . Her long hair flowed in undulations upon the snowy pillows . The fire shone with Rembrandt effect upon her countenance , one side of which was completely irradiated , while the other caught not its mellow light . Thus the perfect regularity of the profile was fully revealed to him who now dared to intrude upon those sacred slumbers . "
65831	65941	65091	65092	beloved one	3442	" murmured Montague ; and he advanced toward the bed . At that moment — whether aroused by a dream , or startled by the almost noiseless tread of feet upon the carpet , we can not say — the lady awoke . She opened her large hazel eyes ; and they fell upon a figure to whom her imagination , thus suddenly surprised , and the flickering light of the fire , gave a giant stature . Her fears in one respect were , however , immediately relieved ; for the voice of Montague fell upon her ears almost as soon as her eyes caught sight of him . "
65949	65959	65091	65092	beloved one	3442	" he said in a harried and subdued tone . "
65966	66009	66010	66010	Villain	3446	" quickly ejaculated the lady , who in a moment comprehended how her privacy had been outraged ; and passing her arm beneath the pillow , she drew forth a long , sharp , shining dagger . Montague started back in dismay . "
66037	66038	66028	66028	I	0	" "
66047	66056	66028	66028	I	0	" ejaculated the young man , cruelly embarrassed . "
66088	66089	66080	66080	I	0	" "
66094	66135	66080	66080	I	0	" said the lady , with a calm and tranquil bitterness of accent that showed how profoundly she felt the outrage — the atrocity , that he , whom she loved so tenderly , had dared to meditate against her : "
66202	66725	66192	66192	I	0	" There was something so determined — so cool — so resolute in the manner and the matter of this address , that Montague felt abashed — humbled — beaten down to the very dust . Even his grovelling soul at that moment comprehended the Roman mind of the woman whom he would have disgraced : a coward when burglars menaced her life , she was suddenly endowed with lion - daring in defence of her virtue . The crest - fallen young man again attempted to palliate his intrusion : with superb scorn she waved her hand imperiously , as a signal to leave the room . Tears of vexation , shame , and rage , started into his eyes , as he obeyed that silent mandate which he now dared no longer to dispute . The moment the wretch had left the boudoir , the lady sprang from the bed and double - locked the door . She then returned to her couch , buried her head in the pillow , and burst into an agony of tears . WHEN Louisa entered the boudoir on the morning which succeeded this eventful night , nothing in Walter 's countenance denoted the painful emotions that filled her bosom . She narrated the particulars of the burglarious entry of the dwelling , and Montague 's opportune arrival upon the scene of action , with a calmness which surprised her faithful attendant . The truth was , that the attempt of the robbers upon the house , and even the danger in which her own life had been placed , had dwindled , in her own estimation , into events of secondary importance , when compared with that one atrocity which had suddenly wrecked all her hopes of love and happiness for ever . The usual mysterious toilet was speedily performed ; and , with a firm step and a countenance expressive of a stern decision , she descended to the breakfast - parlour . Montague was already there — pale , haggard , abashed , and trembling . He knew that the chance of possessing a lovely woman and ten thousand pounds was then at stake ; and , in addition to this perilous predicament of his nearest and dearest hopes , his position was embarrassing and unpleasant in the extreme . Had he succeeded in his base attempt , he would have been a victor flushed with conquest , and prepared to dictate terms to a woman entirely at his mercy:—but he had been foiled , and he himself was the dejected and baffled being who would be compelled to crave for pardon . As Louisa entered the room close upon the heels of Walter , the latter greeted George Montague with a most affable morning 's welcome , and conversed with him in a manner which seemed to say that she had totally forgotten the occurrence of the night . But the moment that Louisa had completed the arrangements of the breakfast table , and had left the room , Walter 's tone and manner underwent an entire and sudden change . "
66733	66749	66726	66726	You	3449	" she said , while a proud smile of scorn and bitterness curled her lips , "
66796	66797	66782	66782	I	0	" "
66807	66814	66801	66801	you	3449	" exclaimed Montague , profoundly surprised . "
66818	66826	66828	66828	you	26649	" repeated the lady , almost indignantly : "
67088	67089	67117	67117	you	0	" "
67095	67114	67117	67117	you	0	" ejaculated Montague , who had listened with deep interest and various conflicting emotions to this strange address : "
67130	67131	67132	67133	Mr. Montague	903	" "
67135	67158	67132	67133	Mr. Montague	903	" returned the lady , with great apparent coolness — though in reality she was inflicting excruciating tortures upon her own heart ; "
67187	67188	67190	67191	Mr. Stephens	899	" "
67193	67197	67190	67191	Mr. Stephens	899	" cried Montague : "
67210	67211	67207	67207	he	899	" "
67221	67226	67212	67212	He	899	" answered Walter solemnly . "
67231	67246	67212	67212	He	899	" ejaculated Montague , in despair at the imminent ruin of all his hopes . "
67292	67293	67328	67328	your	0	" "
67296	67306	67328	67328	your	0	" answered Walter , with unvaried coolness and determination . "
67347	67357	67328	67328	your	0	" she added , glancing over her male attire , "
67379	67380	67328	67328	your	0	" "
67393	67397	67383	67383	you	0	" cried Montague ; "
67434	67435	67436	67436	I	0	" "
67447	67453	67443	67443	you	0	" said Walter , satirically ; "
67524	67525	67521	67521	I	0	" "
67536	67540	67553	67553	I	0	" said Montague : "
67547	67548	67553	67553	I	0	" "
67559	67560	67553	67553	I	0	" "
67580	67581	67553	67553	I	0	" "
67611	67612	67553	67553	I	0	" "
67620	67626	67553	67553	I	0	" exclaimed Montague , passionately : "
67653	67654	67655	67660	The woman who truly loves ,	3465	" "
67765	67795	67797	67797	I	0	" Montague made no reply , but walked towards the window . Strange and conflicting sentiments were agitating in his brain . ' Twas thus he reasoned within himself . "
67919	67956	67957	67957	You	3472	" The selfish mind of George Montague thus revolved the various phases of his present position : and in a few moments he was determined how to act . Turning towards Walter Sydney , he exclaimed , "
67965	67966	67957	67957	You	3472	" "
67985	67986	67967	67967	I	0	" "
68007	68008	68009	68010	Mr. Stephens	899	" "
68052	68053	68039	68040	another friend	3476	" "
68071	68076	68054	68054	You	3472	" said Montague bitterly . "
68097	68103	68104	68104	I	0	" returned the lady proudly . "
68111	68119	68104	68104	I	0	" said Montague , after another pause . "
68147	68148	68136	68136	your	3472	" "
68225	68229	68241	68241	you	3472	" added the lady emphatically,—"and
68255	68256	68241	68241	you	3472	" "
68264	68274	68257	68257	I	0	" returned Montague , well pleased with this arrangement . "
68311	68312	68297	68297	I	0	" "
68318	68323	68315	68315	you	3472	" said the lady ; "
68347	68348	68343	68343	You	3472	" "
68351	68355	68343	68343	You	3472	" replied Montague . "
68364	68365	68360	68360	me	0	" "
68370	68374	68375	68375	You	3472	" exclaimed Walter . "
68452	68492	68450	68450	you	3472	" Walter hesitated for a moment , as if another observation were trembling upon her tongue : then stifling her emotions with a powerful effort , she waved her hand to the delinquent , and abruptly left the room . "
68522	68547	68548	68548	I	0	" said Montague to himself , as he prepared to take his departure from the villa in which he had spent some happy hours . "
68690	68704	68709	68709	I	0	" he added , while his countenance wore an expression of mingled revenge and triumph,—"then
68785	68794	68772	68772	I	0	" he said , with an ironical chuckle : "
68814	69576	68772	68772	I	0	" These or similar reflections continued to occupy the mind of George Montague , after he had left the villa , and while he was on his way to the nearest point where he could obtain a conveyance to take him into the City . THE visitor to the Polytechnic Institution or the Adelaide Gallery , has doubtless seen the exhibition of the microscope . A drop of the purest water , magnified by that instrument some thousands of times , appears filled with horrible reptiles and monsters of revolting forms . Such is London . Fair and attractive as the mighty metropolis may appear to the superficial observer , it swarms with disgusting , loathsome , and venomous objects , wearing human shapes . Oh ! London is a city of strange contrasts ! The bustle of business , and the smile of pleasure,—the peaceful citizen , and the gay soldier,—the splendid shop , and the itinerant pastry - stall,—the gorgeous equipage , and the humble market - cart,—the palaces of nobles , and the hovels of the poor,—the psalm from the chapel , and the shout of laughter from the tavern,—the dandies lounging in the west - end streets , and the paupers cleansing away the mud,—the funeral procession , and the bridal cavalcade,—the wealthy and high - born lady whose reputation is above all cavil , and the lost girl whose shame is below all notice,—the adventurer who defends his honour with a duel , and the poor tradesman whom unavoidable bankruptcy has branded as a rogue,—the elegantly - clad banker whose insolvency must soon transpire , and the ragged old miser whose wealth is not suspected,—the monuments of glory , and the hospitals of the poor,—the temples where men adore a God with affectation , and the shrines at which they lose their gold to a deity whom they adore without affectation,—in a word , grandeur and squalor , wealth and misery , virtue and vice,—honesty which has never been tried , and crime which yielded to the force of irresistible circumstances,—all the features , all the characteristics , all the morals , of a great city , must occupy the attention of him who surveys London with microscopic eye . And what a splendid subject for the contemplation of the moralist is a mighty city which , at every succeeding hour , presents a new phase of interest to the view;—in the morning , when only the industrious and the thrifty are abroad , and while the wealthy and the great are sleeping off the night 's pleasure and dissipation:—at noon , when the streets are swarming with life , as if some secret source without the walls poured at that hour myriads of animated streams into the countless avenues and thoroughfares;—in the evening , when the men of pleasure again venture forth , and music , and dancing , and revelry prevail around;—and at night , when every lazar - house vomits forth its filth , every den lets loose its horrors , and every foul court and alley echoes to the footsteps of crime ! It was about two o'clock in the morning , ( three hours after the burglarious attempt upon the villa , ) that a man , drenched by the rain which continued to pour in torrents , with his hat drawn over his eyes , and his hands thrust in his pockets to protect them against the cold , crept cautiously down West Street , from Smithfield , dodged past the policeman , and entered the old house which we have described at the opening of our narrative . Having closed and carefully bolted the front door , he hastily ascended to the room on the first floor where Walter Sydney had seen him and his companion conceal their plunder four years and four months previously . This man — so wet , so cold , and so miserable — was Bill Bolter , the murderer . Having groped about for a few moments , he found a match , struck it , and obtained a light . One of the secret recesses furnished a candle ; and the flickering glare fell upon the haggard , unshaven , and dirty countenance of the ruffian . Scarcely had he lighted the candle , when a peculiar whistle was heard in the street , just under the window . The features of Bolter became suddenly animated with joy ; and , as he hastily descended the stairs , he muttered to himself , "
69588	69613	68772	68772	I	0	" The individual to whom he opened the door was Dick Flairer — in no better plight , mentally and bodily , than himself . "
69621	69637	69619	69619	Bill	871	" demanded Dick , the moment he set foot in the up - stairs room . "
69642	69660	69619	69619	Bill	871	" answered Bolter , after a close inspection of the cupboard in the wall between the windows ; "
69669	69670	68772	68772	I	0	" "
69675	69679	68772	68772	I	0	" said Dick . "
69746	69747	69729	69731	that young feller	3493	" "

69779	69784	69767	69767	he	3493	" added Dick Flairer . "
69790	69799	69767	69767	he	3493	" observed Bolter , after a long pause . "

70336	70340	70396	70396	you	0	" said Bill . "
70348	70393	70396	70396	you	0	" said Dick , significantly . Bill Bolter shuddered ; and a convulsive motion agitated his neck , as if he already felt the cord around it . His countenance became ashy pale ; and , as he glanced fearfully around , he exclaimed , "
70452	70468	70432	70432	you	0	" The ruffian never expressed the least anxiety relative to the fate of his children . "
70473	70477	70432	70432	you	0	" exclaimed Dick : "
70537	70538	70532	70532	I	0	" "
70548	70564	70546	70546	Dick	872	" cried the murderer , casting a glance of alarm and horror upon his companion . "
70596	70697	70700	70700	you	0	" At that moment a whistle , similar to the sound by which Dick Flairer had notified his approach to Bill Bolter , emanated from the street and fell upon the ears of those worthies . Dick hastened to respond to this summons , and in a short time introduced the Cracksman . The moment this individual entered the room , he demanded if there were anything to eat or to drink upon the premises . He of course received a melancholy negative : but , instead of being disheartened , his countenance appeared to wear a smile of pleasure . "
70711	70758	70759	70759	I	0	" he exclaimed ; and , with these words , he produced from his pocket a quantity of cold victuals and a large flask of brandy . Without waiting to ask questions or give explanations , the three thieves fell tooth and nail upon the provender . "
70790	70801	70804	70804	I	0	" said the Cracksman , when his meal was terminated ; "
70821	70822	70812	70812	I	0	" "
70832	70836	70841	70841	you	0	" demanded Dick . "

70978	70983	70976	70976	Tom	954	" ejaculated Dick Flairer ; "

71033	71034	71005	71005	Bill	871	" "

71094	71099	71083	71083	he	3544	" cried the Cracksman . "
71117	71118	71113	71113	I	0	" "
71129	71133	71113	71113	I	0	" said Dick : "
71146	71147	71144	71144	Tom	954	" "
71194	71309	71187	71187	he	871	" Dick pointed with his finger downwards : Tom comprehended the signal , and nodded approvingly . The brandy produced a cheering effect upon the three ruffians : and pipes and tobacco augmented their joviality . Their discourse gradually became coarsely humorous ; and their mirth boisterous . At length Bill Bolter , who required every possible means of artificial stimulant and excitement to sustain his spirits in the fearful predicament in which he was placed , called upon the Cracksman for a song . Tom was famous amongst his companions for his vocal qualifications ; and he was not a little proud of the reputation he had acquired in the parlours of the various "
71313	71315	71187	71187	he	871	" and "
71318	71447	71177	71177	yourn	3548	cribs"[53 ] which he was in the habit of frequenting . He was not , therefore , backward in complying with his friend 's request ; and , in a somewhat subdued tone , ( for fear of making too much noise — a complaint not often heard in Chick Lane ) , he sang the following lines : — THE THIEVES ' ALPHABET . In this manner did the three thieves pass the first hours of morning at the old house in Chick Lane . At length the heavy and sonorous voice of Saint Paul 's proclaimed six o'clock . It still wanted an hour to sun - rise ; but they now thought it prudent to separate . Tom the Cracksman and Dick Flairer arranged together a "
71452	71859	71177	71177	yourn	3548	" for the ensuing night , which they hoped would prove more fortunate than their attempt on the villa at Upper Clapton ; but Dick faithfully promised Bill Bolter to return to him in the evening before he set out on the new expedition . Matters being thus agreed upon , the moment for the murderer 's concealment arrived . We have before stated that the entire grate in the room which the villains frequented , could be removed ; and that , when taken out of its setting , it revealed an aperture of considerable dimensions . At the bottom of this square recess was a trap - door , communicating with a narrow and spiral staircase , that led into a vault adjoining and upon the same level with the very cellar from which Walter Sydney had so miraculously escaped . The possibility of such an architectural arrangement being fully carried out , with a view to provide a perfect means of concealment , will be apparent to our readers , when we state that the side of the house farthest from the Fleet Ditch was constructed with a double brick wall , and that the spiral staircase consequently stood between those two partitions . The mode in which the huge chimneys were built , also tended to ensure the complete safety of that strange hiding - place , and to avert any suspicion that might for a moment be entertained of the existence of such a retreat in that old house . Even in case the secret of the moveable grate should be discovered , the eye of the most acute thief - taker would scarcely detect the trap - door at the bottom of the recess , so admirably was it made to correspond with the brick - work that formed its frame . The vault with which the spiral staircase corresponded , was about fourteen feet long by two - and - a - half wide . An iron grating of eight inches square , overlooking the Fleet Ditch , was all the means provided to supply that living tomb with fresh — we can not say pure — air . If the atmosphere of the hiding - place were thus neither wholesome nor pleasant , it did not at least menace existence ; and a residence in that vault for even weeks and weeks together was deemed preferable to the less "
71866	72103	71177	71177	yourn	3548	" sojourn of Newgate . But connected with the security of this vault was one fearful condition . The individual who sought its dark solitude , could not emancipate himself at will . He was entirely at the mercy of those confederates who were entrusted with his secret . Should anything happen to these men,—should they be suddenly overtaken by the hand of death , then starvation must be the portion of the inmate of that horrible vault : and should they fall into the hands of justice , then the only service they could render their companion in the living tomb , would be to reveal the secret of his hiding - place . Up to the time of which we are writing , since the formation of that strange lurking - hole in the days of the famous Jonathan Wild , three or four persons had alone availed themselves of the vault as a means of personal concealment . In the first place , the secret existed but with a very few and secondly , it was only in cases where life and death were concerned that a refuge was sought in so fearful an abode . When the grate was removed and the trap - door was opened , the entire frame of Bill Bolter became suddenly convulsed with horror . He dreaded to be left to the mercy of his own reflections ! "
72109	72171	71177	71177	yourn	3548	" said Bill , his teeth chattering as much with fear as with the cold . Fearful , however , of exciting the disgust and contempt of his companions at what might be termed his pusillanimous conduct , he mustered up all his courage , shook hands with the Cracksman and Flairer , and then insinuated his person through the aperture . "
72188	72192	72185	72186	old feller	3550	" returned Dick . "
72207	72212	72185	72186	old feller	3550	" added the Cracksman . "
72227	72747	72216	72216	I	0	" said Flairer . Provided with the little comforts just specified , the murderer descended the spiral staircase into the vault . The trap - door closed above his head ; and the grate was replaced with more than usual care and caution . The Cracksman and Dick Flairer then took their departure from the old house , in the foundation of which a fellow - creature was thus strangely entombed alive ! LET us now return to Mr. Whittingham , whom we left in serious and unfeigned tribulation at the moment when his young master was taken into custody upon the charge of passing a forged note . The Bow Street runner whom the officer had left behind to search the house , first possessed himself of the two letters which were lying upon the table in Markham 's library , and which were addressed respectively to Mrs. Arlington and Mr. Monroe . The functionary then commenced a strict investigation of the entire premises ; and , at the end , appeared marvellously surprised that he had not found a complete apparatus for printing forged notes , together with a quantity of the false articles themselves . This search , nevertheless , occupied three hours ; and , when it was over , he took his departure , quite sulky because he had nothing to offer as evidence save the two sealed letters , which might be valuable in that point of view , or might not . The moment this unwelcome guest had quitted the house , the butler , notwithstanding the lateness of the hour — for it was now dusk — ordered the market cart to be got ready ; and , with the least possible delay , he proceeded into town . Upon his arrival in Bow Street , he found the police - office closed : but upon enquiry he learnt that the investigation of Richard Markham 's case had been postponed until the following morning at eleven o'clock , the prisoner having declared that he could produce a witness who would satisfactorily show his ( the prisoner 's ) entire innocence in the transaction . In the meantime , he had been removed to Clerkenwell Prison . Without asking another question , Whittingham mounted his cart once more , and drove away at a rattling pace to Clerkenwell Prison . There he began to thunder like a madman at the knocker of the governor 's private entrance , and could hardly believe his senses when a servant - girl informed him that it was past the hours to see the prisoners . Whittingham would have remonstrated ; but the girl slammed the door in his face . He accordingly had no alternative save to drive direct home again . The very next morning at nine o'clock Mr. Whittingham entered the Servants ' Arms Tavern ; and with but little of his usual circumlocution and verbosity , enquired the address of Mr. Mac Chizzle , the lawyer , who had been one of the party at that house the evening but one before . "
72753	72758	72759	72759	He	3551	" said the landlord . "
72775	72800	72767	72773	a out - and - out practitioner	3553	" Whittingham did not wait to hear any further eulogium upon the attorney . It had struck him that his young master might require a "
72804	72874	72767	72773	a out - and - out practitioner	3553	" and having the supreme felicity of being totally unacquainted with the entire fraternity , he had felt himself somewhat puzzled how to supply the desideratum . In this dilemma , he had suddenly bethought himself of Mac Chizzle ; and , without waiting to ponder upon the propriety of the step he was taking , he rushed off in the manner described to procure that individual 's address . "
72882	72903	72879	72879	you	0	" cried the lawyer , who was astonished at the unceremonious manner in which Whittingham suddenly rushed into his office : "
72909	72910	72906	72906	you	0	" "
72913	72919	72906	72906	you	0	" was the laconic answer . "
72930	72936	72922	72922	you	0	" said Mr. Mac Chizzle . "
72968	72969	72941	72941	you	0	" "
72974	72990	72941	72941	you	0	" returned Whittingham , flinging his hat upon the floor and himself into a chair . "
72998	73003	72996	72996	sir	26649	" said the lawyer . "
73036	73037	73041	73041	sir	26649	" "

73266	73278	73252	73252	sir	26649	" continued Mac Chizzle , who was particularly fond of hearing himself talk,—"law

73403	73411	73396	73396	I	0	" said the butler , somewhat impatiently ; "

73551	73552	73553	73553	I	0	" "
73558	73596	73553	73553	I	0	" said Whittingham ; and , seeing that Mr. Mac Chizzle now paused at length , he narrated the particulars of his master 's arrest upon an accusation of passing a forged note for five hundred pounds . "
73606	73607	73603	73604	Mr. Whittingham	881	" "
73627	73628	73619	73619	his	3578	" "

73659	73663	73656	73657	Construct counsel	3581	" ejaculated Whittingham ; "

73684	73691	73681	73681	you	26649	" said the lawyer , coolly . "

73743	73747	73748	73749	Master Richard	874	" cried Whittingham . "
73775	73790	73791	73791	Simcox	974	" Mr. Mac Chizzle smiled , and summoned his clerk by the euphonious name of "
73793	73842	73791	73791	Simcox	974	" Mr. Simcox was somewhat slow in making his appearance ; and when he did , a very comical one it was — for his hair was red , his eyes were green , his countenance was studded with freckles , and his eye - lashes were white . "
73845	73851	73843	73843	Simcox	974	" said Mr. Mac Chizzle , "
74003	74004	73992	73992	he	27107	" "
74010	74014	73992	73992	he	27107	" said Simcox . "

74067	74084	74105	74106	a party	3593	" in view to accomplish a particular purpose , and they are always being disappointed by their "
74085	74102	74045	74045	I	0	parties"—- whom , by - the - bye , they never condescended to name . To be "
74108	74110	74045	74045	I	0	" or "
74117	74119	74045	74045	I	0	" or "
74129	74335	74045	74045	I	0	" are excuses which will last as long as business itself shall exist , and will continue to be received as apologies as long as any apologies are received at all . They will wear out every other lie . Whittingham was too much occupied by the affairs of his master , to pay any attention to the orders which the solicitor gave his clerk ; and he was considerably relieved when he found himself by the side of his professional adviser , rolling along the streets in a cabriolet . At length the lawyer and the faithful domestic were set down at the Police - Office in Bow Street ; and in a few moments they were admitted , in the presence of a policeman , to an interview with Markham in one of the cells attached to the establishment . Richard 's countenance was pale and care - worn : his hair was dishevelled ; and his attire seemed put on slovenly . But these circumstances scarcely attracted the eyes of Whittingham:—a more appalling and monstrous spectacle engrossed all the attention of that faithful old dependant ; and this was the manacle which confined his reverend master 's hands together . Whittingham wept . "
74341	74351	74338	74339	Master Richard	874	" he exclaimed in a voice broken by sobs , "
74374	74375	74370	74370	you	874	" "
74385	74392	74368	74368	I	0	" said Richard , deeply affected : "
74429	74430	74414	74414	he	886	" "
74434	74438	74441	74441	I	0	" cried Whittingham . "
74479	74480	74476	74476	himself	886	" "
74497	74509	74485	74485	Winchester	926	" interrupted the butler , a strange misgiving oppressing his mind : "
74556	74664	74553	74553	him	886	" Markham and Mac Chizzle then entered into conversation together : but scarcely had the unfortunate young man commenced his account of the peculiar circumstances in which he was involved , when the jailor entered to conduct him into the presence of the magistrate . Markham was placed in the felon 's dock ; and Mr. Mac Chizzle intimated to the sitting magistrate , in a simpering tone , that he appeared for the prisoner . Now we must inform our readers that Mac Chizzle was one of those low pettifoggers , who , without being absolutely the black sheep of the profession , act upon the principle "
74675	74752	74753	74755	a respectable solicitor	3599	" and practise indiscriminately in the civil and the criminal courts — conduct a man 's insolvency , or defend him before the magistrate — discount bills and issue no end of writs — act for loan societies and tally shops — in a word , undertake anything that happens to fall in their way , so long as it brings grist to the mill . Mr. Mac Chizzle was not , therefore , what is termed "
74757	75133	75134	75134	You	3600	" and the magistrate 's countenance assumed an appearance of austerity — for he had previously been possessed in Markham 's favour — when that individual announced that he appeared for the prisoner . Thus poor Whittingham , in his anxiety to do his beloved master a great deal of good , actually prejudiced his case materially at its outset . Though unhappy and care - worn , Richard was not downcast . Conscious innocence supported him . Accordingly when he beheld Mr. Chichester enter the witness - box , he bowed to him in a friendly and even grateful manner ; but , to his ineffable surprise , that very fashionable gentleman affected not to notice the salutation . It is not necessary to enter into details . The nature of the evidence against Markham was that he had called at his guardian 's banker 's the day but one previously , to receive a sum of money ; that he requested the cashier to change a five hundred pound Bank of England note ; that , although an unusual proceeding , the demand was complied with ; that the prisoner wrote his name at the back of the note , and that in the course of the ensuing morning it was discovered that the said note was a forgery . The prisoner was arrested ; and upon his person was found a second note , of fifty pounds ' value , which was also a forgery . Two letters were also produced — one to Mrs. Arlington , and another to Mr. Monroe , which not only proved that the prisoner had intended to leave the country with strange abruptness , but the contents of which actually appeared to point at the crime now alleged against him , as the motive of his flight . Markham was certainly astounded when he heard the stress laid upon those letters by the solicitor for the prosecution , and the manner in which their real meaning was made to tell against him . The Magistrate called upon him for his defence ; and Markham , forgetful that Mac Chizzle was there to represent him , addressed himself in an earnest tone to Mr. Chichester , exclaiming , "
75169	75170	75153	75155	the prosecuting counsel	3602	" "
75177	75191	75228	75228	you	0	" said Mr. Chichester , caressing his chin in a very nonchalant manner , "
75202	75203	75193	75193	I	0	" "
75211	75226	75228	75228	you	0	" ejaculated Richard , surprised at the tone and manner of his late friend . "
75259	75287	75292	75293	villain Axminster	977	" Mr. Chichester replied in an indignant negative . The magistrate shook his head : the prosecuting solicitor took snuff significantly;—Mac Chizzle made a memorandum;—and Whittingham murmured , "
75295	75296	75292	75293	villain Axminster	977	" "
75302	75306	75307	75308	Mr. Chichester	886	" exclaimed Richard : "
75334	75335	75324	75325	Mr. Talbot	894	" "
75346	75357	75336	75337	Mr. Talbot	894	" answered Chichester , in a measured and determined manner . "
75366	75404	75336	75337	Mr. Talbot	894	" cried Markham , more enraged than alarmed ; and he forthwith detailed to the magistrate the manner in which he had been induced to change the one note , and had become possessed of the other . "
75414	75419	75336	75337	Mr. Talbot	894	" said the magistrate ; "
75440	75487	75436	75436	You	0	" Before Richard could make any reply , he was lugged out of the dock by the jailor ; the next case was called on ; and he was hurried back to his cell , whither Mac Chizzle and the butler were permitted to follow him . "
75498	75515	75436	75436	You	0	" exclaimed Richard , wringing his hands , and walking hastily up and down the cell : "
75572	75573	75574	75575	Master Richard	874	" "
75580	75587	75574	75575	Master Richard	874	" cried the poor old butler , "
75630	75662	75623	75624	Master Richard	874	" As the faithful domestic uttered these words , the tears chased each other so rapidly down his cheeks that he seemed to need consolation quite as much as his master . "
75675	75679	75683	75683	his	3608	" continued Richard ; "
75700	75976	75696	75696	he	26709	" Markham stopped short , and seated himself upon the bench . He suddenly became very faint and turned ashy pale . Whittingham hastened to loosen his shirt - collar , and the policeman present humanely procured a glass of water . In a few minutes he recovered : and he then endeavoured to contemplate with calmness the full extent of the perils which environed him . His opinion of Chichester and Talbot was already formed : but the baronet — could he have been a party to their scheme of villany ? After a moment 's reflection , he answered the question to himself in an affirmative . He had , then , fallen into a nest of adventurers and swindlers . But Diana — oh ! no , she could not have been cognizant of the treacherous designs practised against him : she was doubtless made use of as an instrument to further the plans of the conspirators ! Such were his convictions . Should he , then , give her due warning in time , and afford her an opportunity of abandoning , ere it might be too late , an individual who would doubtless involve her , in the long run , in infamy and peril ? To pen a hasty note to Mrs. Arlington was now a duty which he conceived entailed upon him , and which he immediately performed . He then wrote a letter to Mr. Monroe , detailing the particulars of his unfortunate position , and beseeching him not to be prejudiced against him by the report which he might read in the newspapers the following day . "
75983	75995	75696	75696	he	26709	" said Markham , when he had disposed of these matters ; "
76037	76049	76050	76050	I	0	" Then , addressing himself to Mac Chizzle , he observed , "
76108	76150	76092	76092	He	3618	" Richard had preserved an unnatural degree of calmness as he uttered these words ; and Whittingham was himself astonished at the coolness with which his young master delivered his instructions . The old butler wept bitterly when he took leave of "
76154	76171	76151	76152	Master Richard	874	" and it cost the young man himself no inconsiderable effort to restrain his own tears . "
76182	76203	76175	76175	your	27485	" demanded the butler of the lawyer , as they issued from the door of the police - office together . "
76233	76239	76175	76175	your	27485	" cried the professional adviser . "
76261	76271	76243	76243	you	27485	" said Whittingham , with a very serious countenance , "

76301	76306	76291	76291	I	0	" said the lawyer . "

76335	76339	76320	76320	you	27485	" ejaculated Whittingham : "
76349	76350	76342	76342	I	0	" "
76362	76367	76368	76368	I	0	" resumed the lawyer . "
76382	76409	76371	76371	you	27485	" Mr. Whittingham stared at the professional man with the most unfeigned astonishment , which , indeed , was so great that it checked all reply . "
76412	76420	76371	76371	you	27485	" proceeded the shrewd Mr. Mac Chizzle , "
76443	76444	76433	76434	this Monroe	885	" "
76453	76458	76449	76451	Mr. Mac Chizzle	919	" exclaimed the butler , "
76462	76463	76449	76451	Mr. Mac Chizzle	919	" "
76473	76482	76449	76451	Mr. Mac Chizzle	919	" added the solicitor , shaking his head . "
76528	76529	76519	76519	you	27485	" "
76538	76554	76519	76519	you	27485	" repeated Whittingham , with considerable emphasis on each word as he slowly uttered it . "
76571	76572	76557	76557	you	27485	" "
76578	76583	76557	76557	you	27485	" replied Mac Chizzle : "
76597	76598	76557	76557	you	27485	" "
76610	76621	76557	76557	you	27485	" said the butler , after a moment 's pause . "
76643	76694	76636	76636	you	27485	" Mr. Whittingham then took leave of the solicitor , and proceeded to Bond Street . Within a few yards of the house in which Mrs. Arlington resided , the butler ran against an individual who , with his hat perched jauntily on his right ear , was lounging along . "
76700	76709	76711	76711	you	27485	" ejaculated Mr. Thomas Sugget — for it was he—"what
76725	76726	76711	76711	you	27485	" "
76733	76737	76740	76740	you	27485	" cried Whittingham , "
76752	76767	76742	76742	I	0	" Mr. Suggett gave a good long stare at Mr. Whittingham , and then exclaimed "
76792	76793	76779	76779	I	0	" "
76800	76806	76779	76779	I	0	" demanded the irritated butler . "
76820	76884	76809	76809	they	3628	" said Suggett ; and breaking into a horse - laugh , he passed rapidly on . Whittingham felt humiliated ; and the knock that he gave at the door of Diana 's lodgings was sneaking and subdued . In a few minutes , however , he was ushered into a back room on the first floor , where Mrs. Arlington received him . "
76904	76905	76893	76893	I	0	" "
76915	76920	76893	76893	I	0	" demanded the Enchantress . "
76926	76927	76893	76893	I	0	" "
76933	76945	76946	76946	He	874	" asked Diana , receiving the letter with a trembling hand . "
76969	76978	76957	76957	ma'am	26745	Newgate;"—and the old butler wiped away a tear . "
76982	76986	76957	76957	ma'am	26745	" exclaimed Diana ; "
76994	77016	76957	76957	ma'am	26745	" She immediately tore open the letter , and ran her eye over the contents , which were as follow : — "
77168	77171	77321	77322	the butler	26635	" R. M. "
77172	77181	77183	77183	Diana	946	" When shall you see your master again ? "
77195	77208	77185	77186	the butler	26635	" To - morrow , ma'am — with the blessing of God . "
77209	77220	77222	77223	Mrs. Arlington	891	" My compliments to him — my very best remembrances , "
77225	77235	77222	77223	Mrs. Arlington	891	" and I feel deeply grateful for this communication . "
77244	77247	77249	77249	Diana	946	" And , "
77257	77301	77249	77249	Diana	946	" if there be anything in which my humble services can be made available , pray do not hesitate to come to me . Indeed , I hope you will call — often — and let me know how this unfortunate business proceeds . "
77302	77319	77321	77322	the butler	26635	" Then you do n't believe that Master Richard is capable of this obliquity , madam ? "
77324	77331	77333	77333	Diana	946	" Oh ! no — impossible ! "
77336	77347	77349	77349	Whittingham	881	" Thank ' ee , ma'am , thank ' ee , "
77351	77371	77349	77349	Whittingham	881	" you have done my poor old heart good . God bless you , ma'am — God bless you ! "
77405	77409	77380	77380	his	3638	" Master Richard . "
77515	77521	77523	77524	the baronet	26709	" Well , Di . , "
77526	77531	77523	77524	the baronet	26709	" you seem annoyed . "
77532	77549	77550	77550	she	946	" You will be surprised , gentlemen , when I inform you who has been here , "
77560	77563	77565	77565	Chichester	886	" Indeed ! "
77570	77576	77565	77565	Chichester	886	" who could it be ? "
77577	77585	77587	77588	the baronet	26709	" Not an officer , I hope ? "
77590	77598	77600	77601	Mr. Talbot	894	" The chimley - sweeps , perhaps , "
77603	77610	77612	77612	Diana	946	" A person from Mr. Markham , "
77616	77642	77612	77612	Diana	946	" By his appearance I should conceive him to be the faithful old servant of his family , of whom I have heard him speak . "
77643	77651	77653	77653	Chichester	886	" Whittingham , I 'll be bound ! "
77655	77662	77653	77653	Chichester	886	" And what did he want ? "
77663	77673	77675	77675	Diana	946	" He brought me a letter from his master , "
77677	77687	77689	77689	she	946	" You may read it , if you please . "
77696	77700	77702	77702	Talbot	894	" Read out , "
77716	77736	77738	77739	the baronet	26709	" And what makes the young spark write to you in that d —— d impudent and familiar style ? "
77743	77760	77762	77763	the lady	2373	" You can not but admit that his letter is couched in a most friendly manner , "
77768	77773	77775	77776	the baronet	26709	" Friendly be hanged ! "
77778	77840	77775	77776	the baronet	26709	" I dare say you feel a most profound and sisterly sympathy for the young gaol - bird . After all , your profuse expenditure and extravagance helped to involve me in no end of pecuniary trouble ; and I was compelled to have recourse to any means to obtain money . Somebody must suffer;—better Markham than any one of us . "
77841	77859	77861	77861	Diana	946	" You do well , sir , to reproach me for being the cause of your embarrassments , "
77871	77992	77863	77863	her	946	" Have I not basely lent these rooms to your purposes , and acted as an attraction to the young men whom you have inveigled here to plunder at cards ? I have never forgiven myself for the weakness which prompted me thus far to enter into your schemes . But when you informed me of your plans relative to the forged notes , I protested vehemently against so atrocious a measure . Indeed , had it not been for your solemn assurance that you had abandoned the idea — at all events so far as it concerned Markham — I would have placed him upon his guard — in spite of your threats , your menaces , your remonstrances ! "
78048	78051	78053	78054	the baronet	26709	" Perdition ! "
78056	78077	78053	78054	the baronet	26709	" the world is coming to a pretty pass when one 's own mistress undertakes to give lessons in morality . "
78078	78085	78087	78087	Diana	946	" A desperate necessity , sir , "
78089	78116	78087	78087	Diana	946	" made me your mistress;—but I would sooner seek an asylum at the workhouse this moment , than become a partner in villany of this stamp . "
78117	78126	78128	78129	the baronet	26709	" And , as far as I care , "
78131	78144	78128	78129	the baronet	26709	" you may go to the workhouse as soon as you choose . "
78238	78243	78245	78246	the baronet	26709	" Come , Chichester , "
78256	78278	78279	78279	he	26709	" I shall be off . Talbot — this is no longer a place for any one of us . Madam , "
78289	78312	78279	78279	he	26709	" I wish you a very good afternoon . This is the last time you will ever see me in these apartments . "
78313	78321	78323	78323	Diana	946	" I wish it to be so , "
78332	78339	78341	78342	the baronet	26709	" And I need scarcely observe , "
78344	78355	78341	78342	the baronet	26709	" that after all that has passed between us — — "
78356	78365	78367	78368	the Enchantress	2342	" Oh ! I comprehend you , sir , "
78372	78387	78367	78368	the Enchantress	2342	" you need not fear me — your secrets are safe in my possession . "
78538	78541	78542	78542	she	2342	" No , "
78550	78668	78669	78669	She	2342	" I must not revenge myself that way ! Up to the present moment , I have eaten his bread and have been to him as a wife ; and I should be guilty of a vile deed of treachery were I to denounce him and his companions . Besides — who would believe my testimony , unsupported by facts , against the indignant denial of a man of rank , family , and title ? I must stifle my resentment for the present . The hour of retribution will no doubt arrive , sooner or later ; and Harborough shall yet repent the cruel — the cowardly insults he has heaped on my head this day ! "
78788	78805	78806	78806	she	2342	" Perhaps he thinks that I shall endeavour to win him back again to my arms , "
78810	78832	78833	78833	she	2342	aloud;—"perhaps he imagines that his countenance and support are imperatively necessary to me ? Oh ! no — Sir Rupert Harborough , "
78842	78885	78833	78833	she	2342	" you may vainly await self - humiliation from me ! To - morrow — yes , so soon as to - morrow shall you see that I can command a position more splendid than the one in which you placed me ! "
79036	79076	79028	79028	she	2342	" Count de Lestranges is brilliant in his offers , and immensely rich — no doubt ; but he is detestably conceited , and would think more of himself than of his mistress . His appeal must be rejected ; "
79090	79093	79094	79094	she	2342	" This , "
79101	79133	79094	79094	she	2342	" is from Lord Templeton . Five thousand a - year is certainly handsome ; but then he himself is so old and ugly ! Away with this suitor at once . "
79148	79157	79159	79159	Diana	946	" Here is a beautiful specimen of calligraphy , "
79167	79205	79206	79206	her	946	" but all the sentiments are copied , word for word , out of the love - scenes in Anne Radcliffe 's romances . Never was such gross plagiarism ! He merits the punishment I thus inflict upon him;"—and
79221	79273	79214	79214	she	946	" But what have we here ? Oh ! the German baron 's killing address — interspersed with remarks upon the philosophy of love . Ah ! my lord , love was not made for philosophers — and philosophers are incapable of love ; so we will have none of you . "
79280	79314	79214	79214	she	946	" Here is the burning address of the Greek attaché with a hard name . It is prettily written;—but who could possibly enter upon terms with an individual of the name of Thesaurochrysonichochrysides ? "
79326	79341	79343	79343	Diana	946	" Ah ! this seems as if it were to be the successful candidate , "
79352	79411	79343	79343	Diana	946	" It is written upon a plain sheet of white paper and without scent . But then the style — how manly ! Yes — decidedly , the Earl of Warrington has gained the prize . He is rich — unmarried — handsome — and still in the prime of life ! There is no room for hesitation . "
79420	79471	79472	79473	Diana Arlington	889	" I should have replied without delay to your lordship 's letter of yesterday week , but have been suffering severely from cold and bad spirits . The former has been expelled by my physician : the latter can only be forced to decamp by the presence of your lordship . "
79475	80906	79472	79473	Diana Arlington	889	" Having despatched this note to the Earl of Warrington , the Enchantress retired to her bed - room to prepare her toilette for the arrival of the nobleman around whom she had thus suddenly decided upon throwing her magic spells . At eight o'clock that evening , a brilliant equipage stopped at the door of the house in which Mrs. Arlington resided . The Earl of Warrington alighted , and was forthwith conducted into the presence of the Enchantress . And never was she more bewitching:—never had she appeared more transcendently lovely . A dress of the richest black velvet , very low in the corsage , set off her voluptuous charms and displayed the pure and brilliant whiteness of the skin to the highest advantage . Her ears were adorned with pendants of diamonds ; and a tiara glittering with the same precious stones , encircled her brow . There was a soft and languishing melancholy in her deep blue eyes and in the expression of her countenance , which formed an agreeable contrast to the dazzling loveliness of her person and the splendour of her attire . She was enchanting indeed . Need we say that the nobleman , who had already been introduced to her and admired her , was enraptured with the prize that thus surrendered itself to him ? Diana became the mistress of the Earl of Warrington , and the very next day removed to a splendid suite of apartments in Albemarle Street , while his lordship 's upholsterers furnished a house for her reception . Newgate ! what an ominous sound has that word . And yet the horror exists not in the name itself ; for it is a very simple compound , and would not grate upon the ear nor produce a shudder throughout the frame , were it applied to any other kind of building . It is , then , its associations and the ideas which it conjures up that render the word Newgate fearful and full of dark menace . At the mere mention of this name , the mind instantaneously becomes filled with visions of vice in all its most hideous forms , and crime in all its most appalling shapes;—wards and court - yards filled with a population peculiar to themselves,—dark gloomy passages , where the gas burns all day long , and beneath the pavement of which are interred the remains of murderers and other miscreants who have expiated their crimes upon the scaffold,—shelves filled with the casts of the countenances of those wretches , taken the moment after they were cut down from the gibbet,—condemned cells,—the chapel in which funeral sermons are preached upon men yet alive to hear them , but who are doomed to die on the morrow,—the clanking of chains , the banging of huge doors , oaths , prayers , curses , and ejaculations of despair ! Oh ! if it were true that the spirits of the departed are allowed to revisit the earth for certain purposes and on particular occasions,—if the belief of superstition were well founded , and night could be peopled with the ghosts and spectres of those who sleep in troubled graves,—what a place of ineffable horrors — what a scene of terrible sights , would Newgate be at midnight ! The huge flag - stones of the pavement would rise , to permit the phantoms of the murderers to issue from their graves . Demons would erect a gibbet at the debtor 's door ; and , amidst the sinister glare of torches , an executioner from hell would hang these miscreants over again . This would be part of their posthumous punishment , and would occur in the long — long nights of winter . There would be no moon ; but all the windows of Newgate looking upon the court - yards ( and there are none commanding the streets ) would be brilliantly lighted with red flames , coming from an unknown source . And throughout the long passages of the prison would resound the orgies of hell ; and skeletons wrapped in winding sheets would shake their fetters ; and Greenacre and Good — Courvoisier and Pegsworth — Blakesley and Marchant , with all their predecessors in the walks of murder , would come in fearful procession from the gibbet , returning by the very corridors which they traversed in their way to death on the respective mornings of their execution . Banquets would be served up to them in the condemned cells ; demons would minister to them ; and their food should be the flesh , and their drink the gore , of the victims whom they had assassinated upon earth ! All would be horrible — horrible ! But , heaven be thanked ! such scenes are impossible ; and never can it be given to the shades of the departed to revisit the haunts which they loved or hated — adored or desecrated , upon earth ! Newgate!—fearful name ! And Richard Markham was now in Newgate . He found , when the massive gates of that terrible prison closed behind him , that the consciousness of innocence will not afford entire consolation , in the dilemma in which unjust suspicions may involve the victim of circumstantial evidence . He scarcely knew in what manner to grapple with the difficulties that beset him;—he dared not contemplate the probability of a condemnation to some infamous punishment;—and he could scarcely hope for an acquittal in the face of the testimony that conspired against him . He recalled to mind all the events of his infancy and his boyish years , and contrasted his present position with that which he once enjoyed in the society of his father and Eugene . His brother?—aye — what had become of his brother?—that brother , who had left the paternal roof to seek his own fortunes , and who had made so strange an appointment for a distant date , upon the hill - top where the two trees were planted ? Four years and four months had passed away since the day on which that appointment was made ; and in seven years and eight months it was to be kept . They were then to compare notes of their adventures and success in life , and decide who was the more prosperous of the two,—Eugene , who was dependent upon his own resources , and had to climb the ladder of fortune step by step;—or Richard , who , placed by his father 's love half - way up that ladder , had only to avail himself , it would have seemed , of his advantageous position to reach the top at his leisure ? But , alas ! probably Eugene was a miserable wanderer upon the face of the earth ; perhaps he was mouldering beneath the sod that no parental nor fraternal tears had watered;—or haply he was languishing in some loathsome dungeon the doors of which served as barriers between him and all communion with his fellow - men ! It was strange — passing strange that Eugene had never written since his departure ; and that from the fatal evening of his separation on the hill - top all traces of him should have been so suddenly lost . Peradventure he had been frustrated in his sanguine expectations , at his very outset in life;—perchance he had terminated in disgust an existence which was blighted by disappointment ? Such were the topics of Markham 's thoughts as he walked up and down the large paved court - yard belonging to that department of the prison to which he had been consigned;—and , of a surety , they were of no pleasurable description . Uncertainty with regard to his own fate — anxiety in respect to his brother — and the dread that his prospects in this life were irretrievably blighted — added to a feverish impatience of a confinement totally unmerited — all these oppressed his mind . That night he had nothing but a basin of gruel and a piece of bread for his supper . He slept in the same ward with a dozen other prisoners , also awaiting their trials : his couch was hard , cold , and wretched ; and he was compelled to listen to the ribald talk and vaunts of villany of several of his companions . Their conversation was only varied by such remarks as these : — "
80909	80913	80914	80914	I	0	" said one , "
80936	80937	80926	80926	he	3661	" "
80966	80971	80972	80972	He	3662	" observed a second . "
80987	80988	80984	80984	I	0	" "
80993	80998	80990	80990	my	0	" said a third , "

81032	81037	81027	81027	I	0	" exclaimed a fourth , "
81074	81075	81066	81066	he	3665	" "
81091	81096	81078	81078	you	3664	" cried a fifth ; "
81161	81195	81153	81153	he	987	" At this idea all the prisoners who had taken part in this conversation , burst out into a loud guffaw — but not a whit the more hearty for being so boisterous . "
81200	81213	81153	81153	he	987	" asked Markham , who had listened with some interest to the above discourse,—"is
81233	81234	81153	81153	he	987	" "
81242	81249	81153	81153	he	987	" answered one of the prisoners . "
81300	81301	81283	81284	Baron Griffin	987	" "
81304	81331	81283	81284	Baron Griffin	987	" ejaculated Markham , whose ideas of the marvellous equality and admirable even - handedness of English justice , were a little shocked by these revelations . "
81336	81341	81353	81353	Spikeman	988	" continued his informant , "
81423	81424	81425	81425	I	0	" "
81428	81432	81425	81425	I	0	" said Markham : "
81443	81463	81464	81464	I	0	" The conversation then turned upon the respective merits of the various counsel practising at the Central Criminal Court . "
81469	81473	81474	81474	he	989	" said one : "
81500	81501	81492	81492	he	989	" "
81511	81516	81492	81492	he	989	" observed a second ; "
81544	81545	81531	81531	he	989	" "
81552	81557	81558	81558	his	991	" exclaimed a third ; "
81567	81568	81558	81558	his	991	" "
81576	81581	81558	81558	his	991	" said a fourth : "
81596	81597	81592	81592	they	3663	" "
81616	81621	81601	81601	they	3663	" exclaimed a fifth ; "
81642	81643	81601	81601	they	3663	" "
81666	81671	81672	81672	They	3663	" observed a sixth . "
81690	81738	81672	81672	They	3663	" These remarks diminished still more the immense respect which Markham had hitherto entertained for English justice ; and he now saw that the barrister who detailed plain and simple facts , did not stand half such a good chance of saving his client as the favoured one "
81747	81761	81762	81762	I	0	" By a very natural transition , the discourse turned upon petty juries . "
81771	81775	81762	81762	I	0	" said one , "
81797	81798	81784	81784	I	0	" "
81802	81807	81784	81784	I	0	" demanded another prisoner . "
81847	81848	81849	81849	I	0	" "
81864	81868	81849	81849	I	0	" said another . "
81871	81877	81878	81879	the jury	3365	" exclaimed the first speaker , "
81906	81907	81892	81892	they	2181	" "
81927	81933	81935	81935	he	3705	" said a third prisoner . "
81944	81945	81946	81947	A Metropolitan	3706	" "
81949	81950	81946	81947	A Metropolitan	3706	" "

82113	82114	82104	82104	we	3714	" "
82120	82124	82104	82104	we	3714	" ejaculated Markham . "
82129	82134	82104	82104	we	3714	" was the reply . "
82198	82199	82187	82187	they	3365	" "
82203	82213	82151	82152	the jury	3365	" cried Markham , perfectly astounded at these revelations . "
82222	82227	82151	82152	the jury	3365	" added his informant , "
82250	82251	82230	82232	Old Baily juries	3725	" "
82263	83092	82230	82232	Old Baily juries	3725	" said Richard . In this way did the prisoners in Markham 's ward contrive to pass away an hour or two , for they were allowed no candle and no fire , and had consequently been forced to retire to their wretched couches immediately after dusk . The night was thus painfully long and wearisome . Markham found upon enquiry that there were two methods of living in Newgate . One was to subsist upon the gaol allowance : the other to provide for oneself . Those who received the allowance were not permitted to have beer , nor were their friends suffered to add the slightest comfort to their sorry meals ; and those who paid for their own food , were restricted as to quantity and quality . Such is the treatment prisoners experience before they are tried;—and yet there is an old saying that every one must be deemed innocent until he be proved guilty . The old saying is a detestable mockery ! Of course Markham determined upon paying for his own food ; and when Whittingham called in the morning , he was sent to make the necessary arrangements with the coffee - house keeper in the Old Bailey who enjoyed the monopoly of supplying that compartment of the prison . The most painful ordeal which Richard had to undergo during his captivity in Newgate , was his first interview with Mr. Monroe . This gentleman was profoundly affected at the situation of his youthful ward , though not for one moment did he doubt his innocence . And here let us mention another revolting humiliation and unnecessary cruelty to which the untried prisoner is compelled to submit . In each yard is a small enclosure , or cage , of thick iron bars , covered with wire - work ; and beyond this fence , at a distance of about two feet , is another row of bars similarly interwoven with wire . The visitor is compelled to stand in this cage to converse with his relative or friend , who is separated from him by the two gratings . All private discourse is consequently impossible . What can recompense the prisoner who is acquitted , for all the mortifications , insults , indignities , and privations he has undergone in Newgate previous to that trial which triumphantly proclaims his innocence ? Relative to the interview between Markham and Monroe , all that it is necessary to state is that the young man 's guardian promised to adopt all possible means to prove his innocence , and spare no expense in securing the most intelligent and influential legal assistance . Mr. Monroe moreover intimated his intention of removing the case from the bands of Mac Chizzle to those of a well - known and highly respectable solicitor . Richard declared that he left himself entirely in his guardian 's hands , and expressed his deep gratitude for the interest thus demonstrated by that gentleman in his behalf . Thus terminated the first interview in Newgate between Markham and his late father 's confidential friend . He felt somewhat relieved by this visit , and entertained strong hopes of being enabled to prove his innocence upon the day of trial . But it then wanted a whole month to the next sessions — thirty horrible days which he would be compelled to pass in Newgate ! AS Richard was walking up and down the yard , an hour or two after his interview with Mr. Monroe , he was attracted by the venerable appearance of an elderly gentleman who was also parading that dismal place to and fro . This individual was attired in a complete suit of black ; and his pale countenance , and long grey hair flowing over his coat - collar , were rendered the more remarkable by the mournful nature of his garb . He stooped considerably in his gait , and walked with his hands joined together behind him . His eyes were cast upon the ground ; and his meditations appeared to be of a profound and soul - absorbing nature . Markham immediately experienced a strange curiosity to become acquainted with this individual , and to ascertain the cause of his imprisonment . He did not , however , choose to interrupt that venerable man 's reverie . Accident presently favoured his wishes , and placed within his reach the means of introduction to the object of his curiosity . The old gentleman changed his line of walk in the spacious yard , and tripped over a loose flagstone . His head came suddenly in contact with the ground . Richard hastened to raise him up , and conducted him to a bench . The old gentleman was very grateful for these attentions ; and , when he was recovered from the effects of his fell , he surveyed Markham with the utmost interest . "
83103	83181	83182	83182	I	0	" he inquired , in a pleasant tone of voice . Richard instantly related , from beginning to end , those particulars with which the reader is already acquainted . The old man remained silent for some minutes , and then fixed his eyes upon Markham in a manner that seemed intended to read the secrets of his soul . Richard did not quail beneath that eagle - glance ; but a deep blush suffused his countenance . "
83197	83203	83193	83193	you	3727	" suddenly exclaimed the stranger : "
83219	83220	83221	83221	I	0	" "
83233	83237	83221	83221	I	0	" said Richard . "

83273	83279	83261	83261	you	0	" returned the old gentleman . "
83496	83497	83493	83494	Thomas Armstrong	882	" "
83508	83523	83504	83504	you	882	" said Richard , surveying the great Republican writer with profound admiration and respect , "
83538	83539	83525	83525	I	0	" "
83544	83548	83525	83525	I	0	" continued Armstrong , "
83618	83623	83615	83616	O God	3751	" he added enthusiastically , "
83672	83673	83675	83675	you	882	" "
83679	83685	83675	83675	you	882	" asked Richard , timidly , "
83708	83709	83710	83710	My	0	" "
83777	83788	83789	83789	I	0	" Mr. Armstrong then proffered his counsel upon this point . "
83799	83803	83789	83789	I	0	" exclaimed Markham : "
83809	83810	83789	83789	I	0	" "
83813	83822	83789	83789	I	0	" cried the old man , somewhat bitterly . "
84051	84052	84045	84045	he	3761	" "
84056	84060	84045	84045	he	3761	" ejaculated Richard . "
84075	84079	84073	84073	him	3761	" said Armstrong . "
84091	84095	84082	84082	you	0	" cried Richard : "
84109	84110	84113	84113	he	3761	" "
84118	84128	84130	84130	he	3761	" ejaculated Mr. Armstrong , with a satirical smile : "
84168	84169	84170	84171	The villain	3773	" "
84173	84181	84170	84171	The villain	3773	" cried Markham , with unfeigned indignation . "
84199	84200	84170	84171	The villain	3773	" "
84207	84212	84204	84205	George Montague	903	" returned Mr. Armstrong . "
84216	84220	84213	84214	George Montague	903	" cried Richard . "
84244	84245	84234	84234	you	0	" "
84263	84264	84246	84246	You	0	" "
84277	84285	84246	84246	You	0	" replied the noble - hearted republican . "
84295	84296	84289	84289	you	0	" "
84352	84360	84362	84363	the republican	3777	" From the bottom of my heart , "
84390	84418	84419	84419	he	874	" an unprincipled agitator — the enemy of his country — the foe to morality — a political ruffian — a bloody - minded votary of Robespierre and Danton:"—and
84691	84723	84662	84663	This person	27442	" I 've taken a liberty with your name ; but I know you wo n't mind it . In a place like this we must help and assist each other . "
84724	84730	84732	84732	Markham	874	" And in what way — "
84734	84830	84732	84732	Markham	874	" Oh ! nothing very important ; only it 's just as well to tell you in case the turnkey says a word about it . The fact is , I have n't half enough to eat with this infernal gruel and soup that they give those who , like me , are forced to take the gaol allowance , and my old mother — who is known by the name of the Mummy — has promised to send me in presently a jolly good quartern loaf and three or four pound of Dutch cheese . "
84831	84852	84854	84854	Markham	874	" But I thought that those who took the gaol allowance were not permitted to receive any food from outside ? "
84856	84863	84865	84866	the man	2092	" That 's the very thing , "
84868	84894	84865	84866	the man	2092	" so I have told the Mummy to direct the parcel to you , as I know that you grub yourself at your own cost . "
84895	84906	84732	84732	Markham	874	" So long as it does not involve me — — "
84907	84919	84921	84922	the other	2054	" No — not in the least , my good fellow , "
84924	84930	84931	84931	he	2092	" And , in return , "
84940	84962	84931	84931	he	2092	" if I can ever do you a service , outside or in , you may reckon upon the Resurrection Man . "
84963	84968	84970	84970	Richard	874	" The Resurrection Man ! "
84984	84994	84996	84997	the man	2092	" Yes — that 's my name and profession , "
84999	85035	84996	84997	the man	2092	" My godfathers and godmothers called me Anthony , and my parents had previously blessed me with the honourable appellation of Tidkins : so you may know me as Anthony Tidkins , the Resurrection Man . "
85036	85043	85045	85045	Richard	874	" And are you really — — "
85052	85059	85045	85045	Richard	874	" are you really a — — "
85060	85066	85068	85068	Anthony	998	" A body - snatcher ? "
85070	85100	85068	85068	Anthony	998	" of course I am — when there 's any work to be done ; and when there is n't , then I do a little in another line . "
85101	85108	85110	85110	Markham	874	" And what may that be ? "
85160	85185	85186	85186	he	3220	" Crankey Jem on t'other side will tell you if you ask him . They would not put us together : no — no , "
85195	85229	85186	85186	he	3220	" they know a trick worth two of that . We shall both be tried together : fifteen years for him — freedom for me ! That 's the way to do it . "
85955	85970	85972	85973	a female	3827	" How silent and quiet everything has been lately in the old home opposite , "
85975	85990	86000	86002	a young woman	3828	" Last night — or rather early this morning , I heard singing there , "
86023	86039	86041	86043	the first speaker	27976	" It is very seldom that any one ever goes into that old house now , "
86045	86081	86041	86043	the first speaker	27976	" Strange rumours are abroad concerning it : I heard that there are subterranean places in which men can conceal themselves , and no power on earth could find them save those in the secret . "
86082	86121	86000	86002	a young woman	3828	" How absurd ! I was speaking to the policeman about that very thing a few days ago ; and he laughed at the idea . He says it is impossible ; and of course he knows best . "
86122	86176	86041	86043	the first speaker	27976	" I am not so sure of that . Who knows what fearful deeds have those old walls concealed from human eye ? For my part , I can very well believe that there are secret cells and caverns . Who knows but that some poor wretch is hiding there this very moment ? "
86177	86190	86000	86002	a young woman	3828	" Perhaps the man that murdered his wife up in Union Court . "
86191	86210	86041	86043	the first speaker	27976	" Well — who knows ? But at this rate we shall never get on with our work . "
86453	86467	86469	86470	the burglar	2086	" Well , Bill — alive or dead , eh — old fellow ! "
86472	86482	86484	86485	Bill Bolter	871	" Alive — and that 's all , Dick , "
86491	86502	86504	86504	Dick	872	" My God ! how pale you are , Bill , "
86529	86534	86536	86537	the wretch	27409	" Pale , Dick ! "
86547	86562	86536	86537	the wretch	27409	" I do not believe I can stand a night in that infernal hole . "
86563	86572	86574	86574	Flairer	872	" You must , Bill — you must , "
86576	86595	86574	86574	Flairer	872	" all is discovered up in Union Court there , and the police are about in all directions . "
86596	86610	86612	86613	the murderer	27918	" When was it found out ? Tell me the particulars — speak ! "
86619	86729	86612	86613	the murderer	27918	" Why , it appears that the neighbours heard a devil of a noise in your room , but did n't think nothink about it , cos you and Polly used to spar a bit now and then . But at last the boy — Harry , I mean — went down stairs and said that his mother would n't move , and that his father had gone away . So up the neighbours went — and then everything was blown . The children was sent to the workus , and the coroner held his inquest this afternoon at three . Harry was had up before him ; and — "
86730	86734	86736	86736	Bolter	871	" And what ? "
86740	86746	86748	86748	Dick	872	" And , in course , "
86750	86770	86748	86748	Dick	872	" the Coroner got out of the boy ull the particklars : so the jury returned a verdict — — "
86771	86778	86780	86780	Bill	871	" Of Wilful Murder , eh ? "
86790	86797	86799	86799	Dick	872	" Wilful Murder against William Bolter , "
86803	86809	86811	86812	the criminal	3852	" That little vagabond Harry ! "
86821	86830	86811	86812	the criminal	3852	" I 'll be the death on him ! "
86831	86854	86856	86856	Dick	872	" There 's no news at all about t'other affair up at Clapton , and no stir made in it at all , "
86864	86897	86856	86856	Dick	872	" so that there business is all right . But here 's a lot of grub and plenty of lush , Bill : that 'll cheer ye , if nothink else will . "
86898	86901	86903	86904	the murderer	27918	" Dick ! "
86906	86965	86903	86904	the murderer	27918	" I can not go back into that hole — I had rather get nabbed at once . The few hours I have already been there have nearly drove me mad ; and I can't — I wo n't attempt the night in that infernal cold damp vault . I feel as if I was in my coffin . "
86966	86973	86975	86975	Dick	872	" Well , you know best , "
86979	87010	86975	86975	Dick	872	" A hempen neckcloth at Tuck - up fair , and a leap from a tree with only one leaf , is what you 'll get if you 're perverse . "

87036	87049	87023	87023	his	871	" what am I to do ? what am I to do ? "
87050	87067	87069	87070	Dick Flairer	872	" Lie still down below for a few weeks , or go out and be scragged , "
87072	87131	87069	87070	Dick Flairer	872	" Come , Bill , be a man ; and do n't take on in this here way . Besides , I 'm in a hurry , and must be off . I 've brought you enough grub for three days , as I sha n't come here too often till the business has blowed over a little . "
87635	87702	87609	87613	a man in the street	3880	" Here is a full and perfect account of the horrible assassination committed by the miscreant William Bolter , upon the person of his wife ; with a portrait of the murderer , and a representation of the room as it appeared when the deed was first discovered by a neighbour . Only one Penny ! The fullest and most perfect account — only one Penny ! "
87722	87791	87982	87982	his	3883	" A full and perfect account of the bloody and cruel murder in Upper Union Court ; showing how the assassin first dashed out one of his victim 's eyes , and then fractured her skull upon the floor .

87792	87800	87982	87982	his	3883	" A reward of one hundred pounds ! "

87833	87840	87842	87843	a fourth	28430	" I wonder whereabouts he is , "
87845	87862	87876	87878	a fifth speaker	3883	" No doubt that he has run away — perhaps to America — perhaps to France . "
87863	87874	87876	87878	a fifth speaker	3883	" That shews how much you know about such things , "
87880	87942	87876	87878	a fifth speaker	3883	" It is a very strange fact , that murderers always linger near the scene of their crime ; they are attracted towards it , seemingly , as the moth is to the candle . Now , for my part , I should n't at all wonder if the miscreant was within a hundred yards of us at the present moment . "

88524	88548	88501	88501	Bolter	871	" Show the bull's - eye up in that farther corner : there may be a door in one of them dark nooks . "

88564	88591	88562	88562	another	26953	" the feller would n't be sich a fool as to come to a place that 's knowed to the Force as one of bad repute . "
88592	88626	88501	88501	Bolter	871	" I did n't think , myself , there was much good in coming to search this old crib : but the inspector said yes , and so we could n't say no . "
88627	88673	88501	88501	Bolter	871	" Let 's be off : the cold of this infernal den strikes to my very bones . But I say — that there shelving board that we first lighted on in getting down , is n't made to help people to come here alive . "

88692	88758	88501	88501	Bolter	871	" Yes — plain enough . It leads to a hole that looks on the ditch . But the plank is quite old and rotten ; so I dare say it was put there for some purpose or another a long time ago . Pr'aps the thieves used to convey their swag through that there hole into a boat in the ditch , and — — "
88759	88764	88766	88768	the other policeman	3901	" No , no , "
88770	88791	88766	88768	the other policeman	3901	" it was n't swag that they tumbled down the plank into the Fleet : it was stiff ' uns . "
88792	88818	88501	88501	Bolter	871	" Very likely . But there ca n't be any of that kind of work ever going on now : so let 's be off . "
88909	88926	88927	88927	he	27918	" There is but five men in the world as knows of this hiding - place , "

Dick Flairer is n't likely to sell a pal : Tom the Cracksman I 'd rely on even if he was on the rack . Crankey Jem is staunch to the backbone ; besides , he 's in the Jug : so is the Resurrection Man . They ca n't do much harm there . I think I 'm tolerably safe ; and as for frightening myself about ghosts and goblins — — "
89225	89232	89220	89220	he	3906	" Bill — are you asleep ? "
89250	89259	89284	89284	Dick	872	" Bill — why do n't you answer ? "
89264	89270	89284	89284	Dick	872	" It 's only me ! "
89317	89322	89324	89324	Dick	872	" My dear feller , "
89331	89405	89324	89324	Dick	872	" I did n't mean to come back so soon again , but me and Tom is a - going to do a little business together down Southampton way — someot that he has been told of ; and as we may be away a few days , I thought I 'd better come this evenin ' with a fresh supply . Here 's plenty of grub , and rum , and bakker . "
89406	89423	89453	89453	he	872	" Well , this is a treat — to hear a friendly voice again so soon , "
89425	89436	89324	89324	Dick	872	Bill;—"but why the devil do n't you light the candle ? "
89437	89448	89450	89450	Dick	872	" I 'm a - going to do it now , "
89463	89510	89453	89453	he	872	" I thought I would n't show a light here sooner than was necessary ; and we must not keep it burning too long ; cos there may be chinks in them shutters , and I des say the blue - bottles is on the scent . "
89511	89523	89525	89525	Bill	871	" They come and searched the whole place this mornin ' , "
89527	89536	89525	89525	Bill	871	" but they did n't smell me though . "
89537	89548	89550	89550	Dick	872	" Then you 're all safe now , my boy , "
89552	89606	89550	89550	Dick	872	" Here , look alive — take this basket , and pitch it down the stairs : it 's well tied up , and chock full of cold meat and bread . Put them two bottles into your pocket : there — that 's right . Now — do you want anythink else ? "
89607	89628	89651	89651	he	872	" Yes — a knife . I was forced to gnaw my food like a dog for want of one . "
89629	89634	89636	89636	Dick	872	" Here you are , "
89658	89665	89651	89651	he	872	" Now are you all right ? "
89666	89691	89651	89651	he	872	" Quite — that is , as right as a feller in my sitivation can be . You wo n't forget to come — — "
89770	89773	89775	89776	the murderer	27918	" Damnation ! "
89778	89783	89790	89790	he	871	" I 'm sold at last!"—and
89876	89884	89886	89894	the serjeant who headed the little detachment of police	3922	" Villain ! what have you done ? "
89896	89910	89912	89912	Bolter	871	" I 've drawn the claret of the rascal that nosed upon me , "
89915	89925	89927	89928	the serjeant	3924	" You were never more mistaken in your life , "
89930	89949	89927	89928	the serjeant	3924	" How — what do you mean ? Was n't it that scoundrel Dick that chirped against me ? "
89950	89958	89960	89961	the officer	2833	" No — ten thousand times No ! "
89963	90019	89960	89961	the officer	2833	" it was a prisoner in Newgate who split upon this hiding place . Somehow or another he heard of the reward offered to take you ; and he told the governor the whole secret of the vault . Without knowing whether we should find you here or not , we came to search it . "
90020	90033	90035	90035	Bolter	871	" Then it was the Resurrection Man who betrayed me after all ! "
90061	90076	90051	90051	he	871	" I have murdered my best friend — monster , miscreant that I am ! "
91480	91483	91466	91466	you	3972	" Yes . "
91546	91653	91654	91654	I	0	" I am desired by my lord the Marquis of Gerrano , his Highness 's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , to inform your Excellency that , in consequence of a general amnesty just proclaimed by His Serene Highness , and which includes all political prisoners and emigrants , passports to return to the Grand Duchy of Castelcicala , may be accorded to his Highness Alberto Prince of Castelcicala , nephew of his Serene Highness the Reigning Grand Duke , as well as to all other natives of Castelcicala now resident in England , but who may be desirous of returning to their own country , "
91670	91674	91654	91654	I	0	" Baron Ruperto , "
91717	91933	91934	91934	Your	3995	" You will be astounded , my dear father , when your eye meets the statement I am now at length compelled to make to you . The world believes my establishment to be as firmly based as the rocks themselves : my credit is unlimited , and thousands have confided their funds to my care . Alas , my dear father , I am totally insolvent : the least drain upon the bank would plunge me into irredeemable ruin and dishonour . I have , however , an opportunity of retrieving myself , and building up my fortunes : a certain government operation is proposed to me ; and if I can undertake it , my profits will be immense . Fifty thousand pounds are absolutely necessary for my purposes within six days from the present time . Consider whether you will save your son by making him this advance ; or allow him to sink into infamy , disgrace and ruin , by withholding it . Whichever way you may determine breathe not a word to a soul . The authorities in the Treasury have made all possible inquiries concerning me , and believe me to be not only solvent , but immensely rich . I expect your answer by return of post . "
91943	91947	91934	91934	Your	3995	" James Tomlinson . "
91961	91964	91954	91954	himself	3996	" all possible enquiries:"—he
92033	92047	92026	92026	himself	4000	" From whom , sir , did you anticipate that this letter came ? "
92048	92061	92063	92064	the Examiner	3957	" From Lord Tremordyn . Is it not directed to Lady Tremordyn ? "
92066	92072	92074	92075	the clerk	2971	" It is , sir , "
92077	92089	92074	92075	the clerk	2971	" But it is written by that lady 's daughter Cecilia . "
92090	92102	92104	92105	the Examiner	3957	" I am very sorry for that . The Home Office , "
92107	92128	92129	92129	he	3957	" is particularly anxious to ascertain the intention of Lord Tremordyn in certain party matters ; and it is known , "
92140	92159	92129	92129	he	3957	" that his lordship communicates all his political sentiments to her ladyship , who is now at Bath . "
92160	92172	92174	92175	the clerk	2971	" Then , sir , this letter need not be read ? "
92178	92185	92187	92188	the Examiner	3957	" Not read , young man ! "
92192	92247	92187	92188	the Examiner	3957	" How often am I to tell you that every letter which is once opened , is to be carefully perused ? Have we not been able to afford the government and the police some very valuable information at different times , by noting the contents of letters which we have opened by mistake ? "
92248	92251	92253	92255	the first clerk	4007	" Certainly , "
92257	92300	92253	92255	the first clerk	4007	" There is that deeply - planned and well - laid scheme of Stephens , and his young lady disguised as a man , who lives at Upper Clapton , which we discovered by the mere accident of opening a wrong letter . "
92301	92309	92311	92320	the clerk whose duty it was to read the epistles	4008	" I beg your pardon , sir , "
92336	92356	92357	92359	The young clerk	4010	" I will now proceed with the letter of the Honourable Miss Cecilia Huntingfield to her mother Lady Tremordyn . "
92366	92706	92357	92359	The young clerk	4010	" Oh ! my dear mother , how shall I find words to convey to you the fearful tale of my disgrace and infamy of which I am the unhappy and guilty heroine ? A thousand times before you left London , I was on the point of throwing myself at your feet and confessing all ! But , no — I could not — I dared not . And now , my dear parent , I can conceal my shame no longer ! Oh ! how shall I make you comprehend me , without actually entrusting this paper with the fearful secret ! My God ! I am almost distracted . Surely you can understand my meaning ? If not , learn the doleful tidings at once , my dearest and most affectionate parent : I am about to become a mother ! Oh ! do not spurn me from you — do not curse your child ! It has cost me pangs of anguish ineffable , and of mental agony an idea of which I could not convey to you , to sit down and rend your heart with this avowal . But , O heavens ! what am I to do ? Concealment is no longer possible : in three months more I shall be a mother ! That villain Harborough — the friend of our family , Sir Rupert Harborough,—the man in whom my dear father put every confidence,—that wretch has caused my shame ! And yet there are times , my dear mother , when I feel that I love him;—for he is the father of the child which must soon publish my disgrace ! And now , my fond — confiding — tender parent , you know all . Oh ! come to my rescue : adopt some means to conceal my shame;—shield me from my father 's wrath ! I can write no more at present : but my mind feels relieved now I have thus opened my heart to my mother . "
92714	92718	92357	92359	The young clerk	4010	" Cecilia Huntingfield . "
92782	92787	92775	92777	Mr. Frederick Stephens	1010	" My dear Brother , "
93084	93107	93108	93110	Your affectionate brother	4028	" Burn this letter the moment you have read it : we then know that it can not possibly have told tales . "
93112	93116	93108	93110	Your affectionate brother	4028	" Robert Stephens . "
93133	93137	93149	93149	he	4019	" tell no tales "
93814	93829	93831	93831	Louisa	900	" You ought to be in good spirits this morning , my dearest mistress , "
93839	93854	93831	93831	Louisa	900	" the period so anxiously looked forward to by you has at length arrived . "
93855	93865	93867	93867	Walter	946	" And to - morrow — to - morrow , "
93881	93905	93867	93867	Walter	946	" you , my excellent Louisa , will assist me to adorn myself with that garb which I have neglected so of late ! "
93906	93918	93920	93920	Louisa	900	" I shall be happy both for your sake and mine , "
93931	93949	93920	93920	Louisa	900	" and when I see you recovering all your usual spirits , in a foreign land — — "
93950	93954	93957	93957	Walter	946	" In Switzerland , "
93959	94000	93957	93957	Walter	946	" in Switzerland — whither you will accompany me , my good and faithful Louisa ; and to which delightful country we will proceed without delay ! There indeed I shall be happy — and , I hope , contented ! "
94001	94015	94017	94017	Louisa	900	" Mr. Stephens is to be here at ten , is he not ? "
94024	94084	94017	94017	Louisa	900	" At ten precisely ; and we then repair forthwith to the West End of the town , where certain preliminaries are requisite previously to receiving an immense sum of money which will be paid over to us at the Bank of England . This much Mr. Stephens told me yesterday . He had never communicated so much before . "
94085	94098	94100	94100	Louisa	900	" And this very afternoon it is your determination to leave London ? "
94102	94111	94113	94114	the lady	2373	" I am now resolved upon that step , "
94116	94184	94113	94114	the lady	2373	" You alone shall accompany me : Mr. Stephens has promised to provide for the groom and the old cook . Therefore , while I am absent this morning about the momentous business — the real nature of which , by - the - bye , has yet to be explained to me — you will make all the preparations that may be necessary for our journey . "
94429	94434	94413	94417	Those glances on either side	4065	words—"This is the day ! "
94435	94438	94440	94441	Mr. Stephens	899	" Walter , "
94452	94473	94440	94441	Mr. Stephens	899	" your conduct to - day must crown my designs with glorious success , or involve me in irretrievable ruin . "
94474	94486	94488	94488	Walter	946	" You may rely with confidence upon my discretion and prudence , "
94490	94501	94440	94441	Mr. Stephens	899	" Command me in all respects — consistently with honour . "
94502	94505	94507	94507	Stephens	899	" Honour ! "
94510	94651	94507	94507	Stephens	899	" why do you for ever mention that unmeaning word ? Honour is a conventional term , and is often used in a manner inconsistently with common sense and sound judgment . Honour is all very well when it is brought in contact with honour only ; but when it has to oppose fraud and deceit , it must succumb if it trust solely to its own force . The most honest lawyer sets chichanery and quibble to work , to counteract the chichanery and quibble of his pettifogging opponent : the politician calls the machinery of intrigue into play , in order to fight his foeman with that foeman 's own weapons:—if the French employ the aid of riflemen concealed in the thicket while the fair fight takes place upon the plain , the English must do the same . "
94652	94668	94670	94670	Walter	946	" I certainly comprehend the necessity of frequently fighting a man with his own weapons , "
94672	94688	94670	94670	Walter	946	" but I do not see to what point in our affairs your reasoning tends . "
94689	94694	94696	94696	Stephens	899	" Suppose , Walter , "
94706	94798	94507	94507	Stephens	899	syllable,—"suppose that you had a friend who was entitled to certain rights which were withheld from him by means of some detestable quibble and low chicanery ; suppose that by stating that your friend 's name was George instead of William , for instance , you could put him in possession of what is justly and legitimately his due , but which , remember , is shamefully and most dishonestly kept away from him;—in this case , should you hesitate to declare that his name was George , and not William ? "
94799	94827	94829	94829	Sydney	946	" I think that I should be inclined to make the statement , to serve the cause of justice and to render a friend a signal service , "
94837	94847	94849	94849	Stephens	899	" I could not have expected a different reply , "
94860	94906	94849	94849	Stephens	899	" and you would do so with less remorse when you found that you were transferring property from one individual who could well spare what he was never justly entitled to , to a person who would starve without the restoration of his legitimate rights . "
94907	94912	94914	94914	Walter	946	" Oh ! certainly , "
94929	94932	94934	94934	Stephens	899	" Then , "
94947	94996	94934	94934	Stephens	899	" you would in such a case eschew those maudlin and mawkish ideas of honour , which arbitrarily exact that a falsehood must never be told for a good purpose , and that illegitimate means must never — never be adopted to work out virtuous and profitable ends ? "
94997	95005	95007	95007	Sydney	946	" My conduct in assuming this disguise , "
95016	95056	95007	95007	Sydney	946	" has proved to you , I should imagine , that I should not hesitate to make use of a deceit comparatively innocent , with a view to oppose fraud and ensure permanent benefit to my friend and myself . "
95057	95076	95078	95078	Stephens	899	" Oh ! Walter , you should have been a man in person as well as in mind ! "
95082	95108	95078	95078	Stephens	899	" Now I have no fears of the result of my plans ; and before sun - set you shall be worth ten thousand pounds ! "
95109	95114	95116	95116	Walter	946	" Ten thousand pounds ! "
95120	95133	95116	95116	Walter	946	" How much can be done with such a sum as that ! "
95134	95151	95153	95153	Stephens	899	" You expressed a wish to leave this country , and visit the south of Europe , "
95155	95242	95153	95153	Stephens	899	" you will have ample means to gratify all your tastes , and administer to all your inclinations . Only conceive a beautiful little cottage on the shore of the lake of Brienz — that pearl of the Oberland ; the fair boat - women — the daughters of Switzerland — passing in their little shallops beneath your windows , and singing their national songs , full of charming tenderness , while the soft music mingles with the murmuring waves and the sounds of the oars ! "
95243	95251	95253	95253	Walter	946	" Oh ! what an enchanting picture ! "
95255	95265	95253	95253	Walter	946	" And have you ever seen such as this ? "
95266	95292	95294	95294	Stephens	899	" I have ; and I feel convinced that the existence I recommend is the one which will best suit you . To - day , "
95306	95343	95294	95294	Stephens	899	" shall you recover your rights;—to - day shall you oppose the innocent deceit to the enormous fraud;—to - day shall you do for yourself what you ere now stated you would do for a friend ! "
95344	95463	95464	95465	The lady	2373	" If you have drawn my own case in putting those queries to me,—if immense advantages will be derived from my behaviour in this affair,—if I am merely wresting from the hands of base cupidity that which is justly mine own,—and if the enemy whom we oppose can well afford to restore to me the means of subsistence , and thus render me independent for the remainder of my days,—oh ! how can I hesitate for a moment ? how can I refuse to entrust myself wholely and solely — blindly and confidently — in your hands,—you who have done so much for me , and who have taught me to respect , honour , and obey you ? "
95641	95820	95630	95630	he	899	tone,—"The fortune which must be wrested from the grasp of cupidity this day , would have belonged to your brother ; and no power on earth could have deprived him of it ; for , had he lived , he would yesterday have attained his twenty - first year ! His death is unknown to him who holds this money : but , by a miserable legal technicality , you — you , his sister , and in justice his heiress — you would be deprived of that fortune by the man who now grasps it , and who would chuckle at any plan which made it his own . Now do you comprehend me ? You have but to say that your name is Walter , instead of Eliza,—and you will recover your just rights , defeat the wretched chicanery of the law , and enter into possession of those resources which belong to you in the eyes of God , but which , if you shrink , will be for ever alienated from you and yours ! "
95821	95826	95828	95829	the lady	2373	" In one word , "
95831	95839	95828	95829	the lady	2373	" I am to personate my brother ? "
95840	95847	95849	95849	Stephens	899	" Precisely ! Do you hesitate ? "
95851	95909	95849	95849	Stephens	899	" will you allow the property of your family to pass into the hands of a stranger , who possesses not the remotest right to its enjoyment ? or will you by one bold effort — an effort that can not fail — direct that fortune into its just , its proper , and its legitimate channel ? "
95910	95916	95918	95919	the lady	2373	" The temptation is great , "
95929	95937	95938	95938	she	2373	" but the danger — the danger ? "
95942	95953	95938	95938	she	2373	" what would be the result if we were detected ? "
95954	95968	95970	95970	Stephens	899	" Nothing — nothing , save the total loss of the entire fortune , "
95972	96021	95970	95970	Stephens	899	" and , therefore , you perceive , that want of nerve — hesitation — awkwardness — blushes — confusion on your part , would ruin all . Be firm — be collected — be calm and resolute — and our plans must be crowned with unequivocal success ! "
96022	96041	96043	96044	the lady	2373	" Oh ! if I proceed farther , I will pass through the ordeal with ease and safety , "
96046	96089	96090	96090	she	2373	" I can nerve my mind to encounter any danger , when it is well defined , and I know its extent;—it is only when it is vague , uncertain , and indistinct , that I shrink from meeting it . Yes , "
96100	96152	96153	96153	she	2373	" I will follow your counsel in all respects : you do know — you must know how much we risk , and how far we compromise ourselves;—and when I see you ready to urge on this matter to the end , how can I fear to accompany you ? Yes , "
96165	96176	96153	96153	she	2373	one,—"I will be Walter Sydney throughout this day at least ! "
96177	96182	96184	96184	Stephens	899	" My dear friend , "
96192	96220	96184	96184	Stephens	899	" you act in a manner worthy of your noble - hearted brother , I see — he smiles upon you even in his picture - frame . "
96221	96238	96240	96241	the lady	2373	" I will retrieve from the hands of strangers that which is thine , dear brother , "
96272	96304	96269	96269	she	2373	" But you must acquaint me with the ceremonies we have to fulfil , and the duties which I shall have to perform , in order to accomplish the desired aim . "
96305	96313	96315	96315	Stephens	899	" I need not instruct you now , "
96317	96382	96315	96315	Stephens	899	" the forms are nothing , and explain themselves , as it were;—a few papers to sign at a certain person 's house in Grosvenor Square — then a ride to the Bank — and all is over . But we must now take our departure : the hackney - coach that brought us hither is waiting to convey us to the West End . "
96734	96742	96728	96729	Mr. Stephens	899	" His lordship expects you , sir . "
96773	96795	96766	96766	he	899	" Courage , my dear Walter : you are now about to appear in the presence of the Earl of Warrington ! "
96965	96988	96954	96954	he	899	" I need not ask if you are the young gentleman to whom I am to be introduced as Mr. Walter Sydney . "
96989	96998	97000	97001	Mr. Stephens	899	" This is my ward , your lordship , "
97005	97030	97000	97001	Mr. Stephens	899	" I think it is scarcely necessary to call your lordship 's attention to the striking resemblance which he bears to his lamented father . "
97031	97042	97044	97045	his lordship	3013	" Yes — it would be impossible to mistake him , "
97056	97081	97044	97045	his lordship	3013	" But sit down — pray sit down ; and we will proceed to business . I presume that gentleman is your professional adviser ? "
97082	97087	97089	97089	Stephens	899	" Mr. Mac Chizzle , "
97095	97109	97110	97110	he	899	" Mr. Pakenham , I have had the pleasure of seeing you before , "
97152	97169	97145	97146	Mac Chizzle,—as	1018	" I am astonished to see a person like you employed in so important an affair . "
97191	97259	97176	97179	the Earl of Warrington	891	" The object of this meeting is known to every one present . The duty that devolves upon me is to transfer to Walter Sydney , the only son and heir of the late Stanford Sydney , upon being satisfied with respect to the identity of the claimant , the sum of forty - one thousand pounds now invested in certain stocks in the Bank of England . "
97260	97268	97270	97271	Mr. Pakenham	1017	" It is needless , I presume , "
97273	97304	97270	97271	Mr. Pakenham	1017	" to enter into the particulars of this inheritance . We on our side admit our liability to pay the amount specified by his lordship , to the proper claimant . "
97305	97309	97311	97312	Mac Chizzle	919	" Quite satisfactory , "
97321	97337	97339	97340	Mr. Stephens	899	" The proofs of identity are , then , all that your lordship now requires ? "
97342	97361	97339	97340	Mr. Stephens	899	" And I only require them as a mere matter of necessary form and ceremony , Mr. Stephens , "
97368	97397	97363	97366	the Earl of Warrington	891	" I am well aware of your acquaintance with the late Mrs. Sydney , and of the fact that the deceased lady left her children to your care . "
97398	97408	97410	97410	Stephens	899	" My lord , here are the various certificates , "
97422	97454	97410	97410	Stephens	899	" In the first instance you have the marriage certificate of Stanford Sydney and Letitia Hardinge , the natural daughter of the late Earl of Warrington , your lordship 's uncle . "
97455	97460	97470	97470	he	3005	" Well — well , "
97490	97498	97470	97470	he	3005	" That certificate is beyond all dispute . "
97499	97502	97504	97504	Stephens	899	" Here , "
97506	97543	97504	97504	Stephens	899	" is the certificate of the birth of Eliza Sydney , born October 12th , 1810 ; and here is the certificate of her death , which took place on the 14th of February , 1831 . "
97544	97551	97553	97554	Mr. Pakenham	1017	" This certificate is not necessary , "
97556	97569	97570	97570	he	1017	" as in no case , under the provisions of these deeds , "
97582	97599	97570	97570	he	1017	" could that young lady have instituted even a shadow of a claim to this money . "
97600	97615	97617	97618	Mr. Stephens	899	" We had better possess one deed too many , than one too few , "
97625	97630	97632	97633	the Earl	4112	" Oh ! certainly , "
97635	97666	97632	97633	the Earl	4112	" And this precaution shows the exact condition of the late Mr. Stanford Sydney 's family . The daughter is no more : the son lives , and is present . "
97667	97675	97677	97677	Stephens	899	" Here , then , my lord , "
97679	97699	97677	97677	Stephens	899	" is the certificate of the birth of Walter Sydney , on the 25th day of November , 1814 . "
97733	97742	97744	97745	this gentleman	2368	" It is quite correct , my Lord , "
97747	97757	97744	97745	this gentleman	2368	" We now require two witnesses as to identity . "
97758	97769	97771	97772	Mr. Stephens	899	" I presume his Lordship will receive me as one , "
97774	97782	97771	97772	Mr. Stephens	899	" considering my intimate acquaintance with all — "
97783	97789	97791	97792	the Earl	4112	" Oh certainly — certainly , "
97795	97809	97811	97811	Stephens	899	" And Mr. Mac Chizzle will tender his evidence in the other instance , "
97813	97826	97828	97829	Mac Chizzle	919	" I have known this young gentleman for the last six years , "
97835	97843	97828	97829	Mac Chizzle	919	" and I knew his mother also . "
97844	97850	97852	97853	Mr. Pakenham	1017	" Is your Lordship satisfied ? "
97860	97863	97865	97866	the nobleman	3005	" Perfectly , "
97871	97881	97865	97866	the nobleman	3005	" I am , however , in your hands . "
97882	97889	97891	97892	Mr. Pakenham	1017	" Oh ! as for me , "
97894	97910	97891	97892	Mr. Pakenham	1017	" I have no objection to offer . Your Lordship is acquainted with Mr. Stephens . "
97911	97916	97919	97920	the Earl	4112	" Yes — yes , "
97922	97943	97919	97920	the Earl	4112	" I have known Mr. Stephens for some years — and I know him to be a man of honour . "
97944	97954	97956	97956	Pakenham	1017	" Then there is nothing more to be said , "
97958	97963	97965	97966	Mac Chizzle	919	" No — nothing , "
97968	97975	97965	97966	Mac Chizzle	919	" but to complete the business . "
97976	97984	97986	97987	Mr. Pakenham	1017	" I will now read the release , "
98461	98470	98471	98471	She	4094	" Will you now please to sign this ? "
98561	98602	98555	98557	the disguised lady	4094	" Mr. Walter Sydney , I have much pleasure in putting you in possession of this fortune ; and I can assure you that my best — my very best wishes for your health and prosperity , accompany the transfer . "
98622	98628	98630	98631	the Earl	4112	" Perhaps , Mr. Stephens , "
98640	98711	98630	98631	the Earl	4112	" you and your friends will do me the honour to accept of a slight refreshment in an adjoining room . You will excuse my absence ; but I have a few matters of pressing importance to transact with my solicitor , and which can not possibly be postponed . You must accept this as my apology ; and believe in my regret that I can not keep you company . "
98841	98853	98855	98856	Mac Chizzle	919	" Well , I think we managed the job very correctly , "
98858	98868	98870	98871	Mr. Stephens	899	" Everything passed off precisely as I had anticipated , "
98873	98883	98870	98871	Mr. Stephens	899	" But you , Walter — you are serious . "
98884	98905	98907	98907	she	4149	" I do not look upon the transaction in the same light as I did a couple of hours since , "
98910	98917	98919	98919	Stephens	899	" Ah ! my dear friend , "
98921	98963	98919	98919	Stephens	899	" you are deceived by the apparent urbanity of that nobleman , and the mildness of his solicitor . They assumed that appearance because there was no help for them;—they had no good to gain by throwing obstacles in our way . "
98964	98975	98977	98977	Walter	897	" But the certificate of my death was a forgery , "
98981	99000	99002	99002	Stephens	899	" A necessary alteration of names — without which the accomplishment of our plan would have been impossible , "
99004	99092	99002	99002	Stephens	899	" But let me ease your mind in one respect , my dear Walter . That nobleman is a relation of yours — and yet until this day his name has never been mentioned to you . And why ? Because he visits upon you the hatred which he entertained for your deceased mother ! Did you not observe that he interrupted me when I spoke of her ? did you not notice that he touched with extreme aversion upon the topics connected with your revered parents ? "
99093	99098	99100	99100	Walter	897	" I did!—I did ! "
99102	99109	99111	99111	Stephens	899	" He hates you!—he detests you ! "
99115	99167	99111	99111	Stephens	899	" and he will not countenance any claim which you might advance towards kinship with him . His duties as a nobleman and a gentleman dictated the outward civility with which he treated you ; but his heart gave no echo to the words of congratulation which issued from his lips . "
99168	99182	99184	99184	Walter	897	" I believe you — I know that you are speaking the truth , "
99186	99204	99205	99205	Stephens	899	" Pardon me , if for a moment I ceased to look upon you as a friend . "
99531	99537	99539	99540	the clerk	2971	" Those are the persons , "
99563	99574	99554	99554	he	2971	" Your plans are detected — these men are officers ! "
99575	99578	99545	99545	he	2971	" Officers ! "
99582	99588	99545	99545	he	2971	" What does this mean ? "
99589	99597	99599	99603	the foremost of those functionaries	4172	" We are here to apprehend you , "
99605	99618	99599	99603	the foremost of those functionaries	4172	" Resistance will be vain : there are others outside in readiness . "
99619	99623	99625	99625	Walter	897	" Merciful heavens ! "
99633	99645	99625	99625	Walter	897	" Oh ! Stephens , to what have you brought me ! "
99927	99936	99938	99939	the magistrate	27233	" With what do you charge these prisoners ? "
99941	99974	99938	99939	the magistrate	27233	" With conspiring to obtain the sum of forty - one thousand pounds from the hands of the Earl of Warrington , and the Governor and Company of the Bank of England . "
99975	99981	100151	100152	the solicitor	28220	" Is his lordship present ? "
99982	100136	99938	99939	the magistrate	27233	" Your worship , he is , at this moment , unaware of the diabolical fraud that has been contemplated , and in part perpetrated upon him . He has given up to the prisoners certain documents , which constituted their authority for transferring and selling out the sum I have mentioned . By certain means the intentions of the prisoners were discovered some time ago ; and secret information was given to the Bank directors upon the subject . The directors were not , however , permitted to communicate with the Earl of Warrington , under penalty of receiving no farther information from the quarter whence the original warning emanated . Under all circumstances , I shall content myself with stating sufficient to support the charge to - day , so that your worship may remand the prisoners until a period when the attendance of the Earl of Warrington can be procured . "
100137	100142	99938	99939	the magistrate	27233	" State your case . "
100143	100149	100151	100152	the solicitor	28220	" I charge this prisoner , "
100158	100208	100151	100152	the solicitor	28220	" with endeavouring to obtain the sum of forty - one thousand pounds from the Governor and Company of the Bank of England , under pretence of being one Walter Sydney , a man — whereas the prisoner 's name is Eliza Sydney , and she is a woman ! "
100239	100262	100264	100265	the solicitor	28220	" And I charge the other prisoners , Robert Stephens and Hugh Mac Chizzle , with aiding and abetting in the crime , "
100309	100341	100342	100342	she	4203	" It is true ! I am not what I seem ! I have been guilty of a fearful deception — a horrible cheat : but it was he — he , "
100349	100356	100342	100342	she	4203	" who made me do it ! "
100382	100387	100388	100388	he	4206	" You must remember , "
100396	100411	100388	100388	he	4206	" that anything which you admit here , may be used against you elsewhere . "
100412	100430	100432	100433	the lady	2373	" I am anxious to confess all that I have done , and all that I know , "
100435	100463	100388	100388	he	4206	" and in so doing , I shall in some measure atone for the enormity of my guilt , which I now view in its true light ! "
100464	100469	100471	100472	the alderman	4208	" Under these circumstances , "
100474	100485	100471	100472	the alderman	4208	" let the case stand over until to - morrow . "
101257	101364	101365	101370	The bailiff of the Warrington estate	4241	" The late Earl of Warrington was a man of eccentric and peculiar habits . An accident in his infancy had rendered his person deformed and stunted his growth ; and , being endowed with tender feelings and acute susceptibilities , he could not bear to mingle in that society where his own physical defects were placed in strong contrast with the fine figures , handsome countenances , and manly forms of many of his aristocratic acquaintances . He possessed a magnificent estate in Cambridgeshire ; and in the country seat attached to that domain did he pass the greater portion of his time in solitude . "
101464	101625	101626	101626	They	4250	" The reserved and world - shunning Earl soon became attracted towards Letitia Hardinge . He found that she possessed a high order of intellect ; and he delighted to converse with her . By degrees he experienced a deep attachment towards a being whose society often relieved the monotonous routine of his life ; and the gratitude which Letitia entertained towards the Earl for his kindness to her , soon partook of a more tender feeling . She found herself interested in a nobleman of high rank and boundless wealth , who was compelled to avoid the great world where the homage shown to his proud name appeared to him to be a mockery of his physical deformity ; she ministered to him with all a woman 's devotedness , during a tedious and painful malady which seized upon him shortly after his arrival in Cambridgeshire ; and at length her presence became as it were necessary to him . "
101716	101815	101816	101817	Letitia Hardinge	1021	" Letitia Hardinge , the Earl 's natural child , grew up in health and beauty . The father was dotingly attached to her , and watched her growth with pride and adoration . She was sixteen years of age , when Frederick , the Earl 's nephew and heir presumptive to the title and vast estates of the family , arrived in Cambridgeshire to pay his respects to his uncle , on his emancipation from college . The young man 's parents had both died in his infancy , and he was entirely dependant upon the Earl . "
101937	102068	102071	102083	a farmer upon the Earl 's estate , of the name of Sydney	4266	" The Earl beheld this attachment on his part , and was rejoiced . An union between the two cousins would secure to his adored daughter that rank and social position , which he was most anxious for her to occupy . As the wife of the heir presumptive to the richest Earldom in the realm , her origin would never be canvassed nor thought of . But Letitia herself returned not the young man 's love . By one of those extraordinary caprices , which so often characterise even the strongest female minds , she had taken a profound aversion to her suitor ; and being of a high and independent disposition , not even the dazzling prospect of wealth and title could move her heart in his favour . "
102225	102489	102490	102492	The old man	2222	" Reckless of this threat — indifferent to the feelings of that father who had cherished her so fondly , the perverse girl one morning abandoned the paternal home , and fled with Stanford Sydney , on whom she bestowed her hand . The blow came like a thunderbolt upon the head of the old Earl . He was naturally of a delicate and infirm constitution ; and this sudden misfortune proved too much for his debilitated frame . He took to his bed ; and a few hours before his death he made a will consistent with his oath . He left all his property to his nephew , with the exception of forty - one thousand pounds — the amount of his savings since he had inherited the title . This will ordained that his nephew should enjoy the interest of this sum ; but that , should Letitia bear a male child to Stanford Sydney , such issue should , upon attaining the age of twenty - one years , receive as his portion the above sum of forty - one thousand pounds . Such was the confidence which the old Earl possessed in his nephew , that he left the execution of this provision to him . It was also enacted by that will , that should the said Letitia die without bearing a son to the said Stanford Sydney ; or should a son born of her die previously to attaining his twenty - first year , then the sum alluded to should become the property of Frederick . "
102539	102730	102516	102516	Frederick	1010	" The fruits of the union of Stanford Sydney and Letitia Hardinge were a daughter and a son . The name of the former was Eliza : that of the latter was Walter . Eliza was a strong and healthy child ; Walter was sickly and ailing from his birth . Shortly after the birth of Walter , the father , who had long been in a deep decline , paid the debt of nature . Letitia was then left a widow , with two young children , and nothing but a small farm for her support . Her high spirit prevented her from applying to the Earl of Warrington — the man whose love she had slighted and scorned ; and thus she had to struggle with poverty and misfortune in rearing and educating her fatherless progeny . The farm which she tenanted was situated in Berkshire , whither she and her husband had removed immediately after the death of the father of Stanford . This farm belonged to a gentleman of the name of Stephens — a merchant of respectability and property , in the City of London . "
102896	103028	103029	103029	Stephens	899	" Robert Stephens was immediately attracted towards that family . It was not the beauty of Eliza which struck him:—he was a cold , calculating man of the world , and considered female loveliness as mere dross compared to sterling gold . He found that Walter was an amiable and simple - hearted youth , and he hoped to turn to his own advantage the immense inheritance which awaited the lad at his majority . He accordingly treated Mrs. Sydney with every indulgence , forgiving her the arrears already accumulated , and lowering her rent in future . He thus gained an immense influence over the family ; and when a sudden malady threw the widow upon her death - bed , it was to Stephens that she recommended her children . "
103099	103256	103257	103257	Stephens	899	" Scarcely had the breath left the body of the youth , when Stephens , by that species of magic influence which he had already begun to exercise over Eliza , induced her to assume her brother 's garb ; and she was taught to believe , even by the very side of his corpse , that immense interests were connected with her compliance with his wish . An old woman was the only female attendant at the farm - house ; and she was easily persuaded to spread a report amongst the neighbours that it was the daughter who was dead . Eliza did not stir abroad : Stephens managed the funeral , and gave instructions for the entry in the parish register of the burial of Eliza Sidney ; and , as Eliza immediately afterwards repaired to the Villa at Clapton , the fraud was not suspected in the neighbourhood of the Berkshire farm . "
103374	103507	103369	103372	the deceased Letitia Hardinge	1021	" When Stephens introduced the disguised Eliza to the nobleman , as Walter Sydney , upon the morning of the 26th of November , the Earl entertained not the least suspicion of fraud . He knew that Stephens was the son of an eminent merchant , and that he was well spoken of in society ; and he was moreover anxious to complete a ceremony which only recalled painful reminiscences to his mind . Thus , so far as his lordship was concerned , the deceit was managed with the most complete success ; and there is no doubt that the entire scheme might have been carried out , and the secret have remained for ever undiscovered , had not a private warning been communicated in time to the Bank of England . "
104758	104782	104749	104749	he	2889	crimination.—"Circumstances of a very peculiar nature , and which I can not at present explain , compel me to quit London thus abruptly . "
104783	104798	104749	104749	he	2889	" I could not have remained in London another minute with safely to myself . "
104799	104854	104749	104749	he	2889	" I conceive it to be my duty — in consequence of rumours which may shortly reach you concerning me — to inform you that I have this moment only awoke to the fearful perils of the career in which I have for some weeks past been blindly hurrying along , till at length yesterday——. "
104855	104875	104749	104749	he	2889	" I am penitent , deeply penitent : let this statement induce you to defend and protect my reputation . "
104890	104897	104749	104749	he	2889	" till at length yesterday — — "
105093	105100	105081	105083	Markham 's counsel	4394	" What are you , sir ? "
105101	105106	105229	105233	the counsel for the defence	4396	" A private gentleman . "
105107	105115	105051	105051	He	886	" What are your means of subsistence ? "
105116	105125	105081	105083	Markham 's counsel	4394	" I receive an allowance from my father . "
105126	105145	105229	105233	the counsel for the defence	4396	" Who is your father ? Now , take care , sir , how you answer that question . "
105146	105155	105051	105051	He	886	" He is a commercial man , sir . "
105156	105163	105081	105083	Markham 's counsel	4394	" Is he not a tradesman ? "
105164	105177	105229	105233	the counsel for the defence	4396	" Well,—he is a tradesman , then — if you like it . "
105178	105203	105051	105051	He	886	" Yes,—I do like it . Now — upon your oath — is he not a pawnbroker in Brick - lane , Bethnal Green ? "
105204	105222	105081	105083	Markham 's counsel	4394	" He is a goldsmith in a large way of business , and lends money occasionally — — "
105223	105226	105229	105233	the counsel for the defence	4396	" Ha ! "
105235	105245	105229	105233	the counsel for the defence	4396	" Go on , sir : lends money occasionally — "
105246	105254	105256	105256	Chichester	886	" Upon real security , I suppose , "
105265	105293	105295	105296	the barrister	4397	" Upon deposits ; let us give things their proper names . He lends money upon flannel petticoat — watches — flat - irons , & c. , "
105302	105329	105295	105296	the barrister	4397	" But I have not done with you yet , sir . Was your father — this very respectable pawnbroker — ever elevated to the peerage ? "
105330	105337	105256	105256	Chichester	886	" He was not , sir . "
105338	105353	105354	105355	Mr. Chichester	886	" Then how come you by the distinction of Honourable prefixed to your name ? "
105393	105417	105418	105420	The cross examination	4399	" that he had no right to the distinction , but that he had assumed it as a convenient West - End appendage . "
105424	105435	105418	105420	The cross examination	4399	" Did you not travel under the name of Winchester ? "
105436	105443	105256	105256	Chichester	886	" I did — in Germany . "
105444	105455	105256	105256	Chichester	886	" With what motive did you assume a false name ? "
105456	105463	105418	105420	The cross examination	4399	" I had no particular motive . "
105464	105487	105256	105256	Chichester	886	" Did you not leave England in debt ? and were you not afraid of your bills of exchange following you abroad ? "
105488	105508	105256	105256	Chichester	886	" There is some truth in that ; but the most honourable men are frequently involved in pecuniary difficulties . "
105509	105554	105418	105420	The cross examination	4399	" Answer my questions , sir , and make no observations . You will leave me to do that , if you please . Now sir — tell the jury whether you were not accompanied by a valet or coachman in your German trip ? "
105555	105566	105256	105256	Chichester	886	" I am always accustomed to travel with a domestic . "
105567	105618	105256	105256	Chichester	886	" A man who runs away from his creditors , should have more delicacy than to waste his money in such a manner . When you were at Baden - baden , were you not involved in some gambling transactions which compelled you to quit the Grand - Duchy abruptly ? "
105619	105639	105418	105420	The cross examination	4399	" I certainly had a dispute with a gentleman at cards : and I left the town next morning . "
105640	105662	105256	105256	Chichester	886	" Yes — and you left your clothes and your servant behind you — and your bill unpaid at the hotel ? "
105663	105683	105256	105256	Chichester	886	" But I have since met my servant , and paid him more than double the wages then due . "

106923	106938	106914	106914	he	2889	" He could not have remained in London another minute with safety to himself . "
106963	106968	106958	106958	They	4470	" He was penitent ; "

108698	108709	108710	108710	he	4567	" Thou art a blood - thirsty and merciless wretch , "
108717	108731	108710	108710	he	4567	" No : on the other hand , I subscribe to philanthropic institutions ! "
108944	108949	108951	108952	the spectators	4583	" That 's all ! "
109538	109656	109535	109535	He	3678	" Robert Stephens , you have been guilty of one of the most serious attempts at fraud , which , in a commercial country and a civilised community , could be perpetrated . You have moreover availed yourself of your influence over a young and confiding woman — an influence obtained by a series of kind actions towards her mother , her late brother , and herself — to convert her into the instrument of your guilty designs . The court can not pass over your case without inflicting the severest penalty which the law allows . The sentence of the Court is that you be transported beyond the seas for the term of your natural life . "
109686	109835	109679	109679	he	4624	" My Lord , I acknowledge the justice of my sentence : but permit me to observe that the female prisoner Eliza Sydney is innocent of any attempt to defraud . Up to a few hours before we called upon the Earl of Warrington to sign the release and obtain the bank receipts , she was ignorant of the real object which I had in view . Even then , when I unveiled my designs , she shrank from the part she had to perform ; and I was compelled to make use of all the specious arguments and all the sophistry I could call to my aid , to blind her as to the real nature of the transaction . My Lord , I make these few observations in justice to her ; I have nothing now to lose or gain by this appeal in her behalf . "
109896	110002	109892	109893	The Judge	3678	" Hugh Mac Chizzle , you have been found guilty of aiding and abetting , at the last moment , in the consummation of a deed of almost unpardonable fraud . You have taken advantage of a profession which invests him who practises it with an appearance of respectability , and gives him opportunities of perpetrating , if he be so inclined , enormous breaches and abuses of confidence : You stand second in degree of culpability to the prisoner Stephens . The sentence of the court , therefore , is , that you be transported beyond the seas for the term of fifteen years . "
110025	110196	110010	110011	the Judge	3678	" Eliza Sydney , your share in this unfortunate and guilty business has been rather that of an instrument than a principal . Still you had arrived , when you first assumed a masculine disguise , at the years of discretion , which should have taught you to reflect that no deceit can be designed for a good purpose . Your readiness to confess your guilt — the testimony of your fellow prisoner in your behalf — the recommendation of the jury — and the intercession of the prosecutor , however , weigh with the court . Still a severe punishment must be awarded you ; for if we were to admit the plea that a person between twenty and thirty is not responsible for his or her actions , justice would in numerous cases be defeated , and crime would find constant apologies and extenuation . The sentence of the court is that you be imprisoned for the space of two years in her Majesty 's gaol of Newgate . "
110227	110236	110224	110225	the Judge	3678	" a severe punishment must be awarded her , "
110335	110344	110346	110347	the Enchantress	2342	" Do not be alarmed , Miss Sydney , "
110349	110382	110346	110347	the Enchantress	2342	" the Earl of Warrington will do more for you than you may anticipate . He will use his influence with the Home Secretary , and obtain a mitigation of your sentence . "
110383	110398	110400	110400	Eliza	902	" Oh ! how kind in him thus to interest himself in my behalf , "
110402	110414	110400	110400	Eliza	902	" and I — who am so unworthy of his commiseration ! "
110415	110482	110346	110347	the Enchantress	2342	" Do not say that ! we have made enquiries , and we have found how you have been deceived . We have seen your faithful servant Louisa ; and she has told us enough to convince us that you was more to be pitied than blamed . One thing I have to communicate which will console you — I have taken Louisa into my service ! "
110483	110492	110494	110494	Eliza	902	" A thousand thanks , my dear madam , "
110496	110538	110494	110494	Eliza	902	" The thought of what was to become of her has made me very unhappy . This is indeed one subject of comfort . But I saw Louisa yesterday : why did she keep me in the dark in this respect ? "
110539	110549	110551	110552	Mrs. Arlington	891	" We enjoined her to maintain the strictest silence , "
110554	110590	110551	110552	Mrs. Arlington	891	" We were determined to see how you would act up to the very last moment in this distressing business , ere we allowed you to know that you had friends who cared for you . "
110591	110601	110603	110603	Eliza	902	" And how have I obtained this generous sympathy ? "
110615	110643	110645	110645	Diana	889	" The Earl loved your mother , and blames himself for his neglect of her children , whose welfare would have been dear to his deceased uncle , "
110648	110653	110654	110654	she	889	" And for myself , "
110657	110667	110654	110654	she	889	blushing—"anything which interests the Earl , also interests me . "
110668	110690	110692	110692	Eliza	902	" Believe me , I shall never forget this kindness on your part:—neither shall I ever be able to repay it , "
110694	110709	110710	110710	she	902	" I am now going to a protracted incarceration , in a terrible prison , "
110712	110747	110710	110710	she	902	mournfully,—"and God only knows whether I may survive it . But until the day of my death shall I pray for you and that good nobleman who forgives , pities , and consoles me . "
110748	110755	110757	110758	Mrs. Arlington	891	" He does — he does , "
110763	110825	110757	110758	Mrs. Arlington	891	" but fancy not that your confinement will pass without being relieved by the visits of friends . I shall call and see you as often as the regulations of the prison will permit ; and I again renew the promise which the Earl has authorised me to make relative to his intercession with the Secretary of State in your favour . "

111938	111950	111929	111929	his	26709	" My God ! Chichester , is nothing to be done ? "
111951	111958	111960	111961	that individual	28209	" I really do n't know , "
111963	112014	111929	111929	his	26709	" You heard how deucedly I got exposed to - day in the witness - box ; and after that I should not dare show up at the west - end for weeks and months to come — even if the sheriff 's officers were n't looking out for me . "
112015	112023	112025	112026	the baronet	26709	" Well , something must be done , "
112028	112074	112025	112026	the baronet	26709	" Here am I , playing at hide - and - seek as well as you — all my horses sold — my furniture seized — my carriages made away with — my plate pawned — and not a guinea — not a guinea left ! "
112075	112087	112089	112089	Chichester	886	" What should you say to a trip into the country ? "
112095	112180	112089	112089	Chichester	886	" London is too hot for both of us — at least for the present ; indeed my surprise is that we were not arrested on those infernal bills , coming out of the court . But , as I was saying — a trip into the country might do more good . To be sure , this is no time for the watering places : we might , however , pay a visit to Hastings , Bath , and Cheltenham on a venture . "
112181	112191	112025	112026	the baronet	26709	" And what could we do for ourselves there ? "
112192	112203	112025	112026	the baronet	26709	" Why — pick up flats , to be sure ! "
112204	112225	112089	112089	Chichester	886	" You know , Chichester , that I am not able to work the cards and dice as you can . "
112226	112236	112025	112026	the baronet	26709	" Then you must learn , as I did . "
112237	112244	112025	112026	the baronet	26709	" And who will teach me ? "
112245	112264	112089	112089	Chichester	886	" Why — myself , to be sure ! Could you have a better master than Arthur Chichester ? "
112265	112285	112025	112026	the baronet	26709	" But it would take so long to understand all these manœuvres — I should never have the patience . "
112286	112311	112025	112026	the baronet	26709	" Oh ! nonsense , Harborough . Come — what do you say ? Three days ' practice , and we will be off ? "
112312	112323	112325	112326	the baronet	26709	" But the money — the funds to move with ? "
112330	112340	112325	112326	the baronet	26709	" I am literally reduced to my last guinea . "
112341	112348	112025	112026	the baronet	26709	" Oh ! as for that , "
112352	112382	112350	112350	Chichester	886	" I will engage to get a twenty pound note from my father to - morrow ; and with that supply we can safely start off on our expedition . "
112383	112394	112396	112397	the baronet	26709	" Well — if you can rely upon doing this , "
112399	112424	112396	112397	the baronet	26709	" we will put your plan into execution . So let us lose no time ; but please to give me my first lesson . "
112425	112433	112435	112435	Chichester	886	" That 's what I call business , "
112514	112540	112500	112500	he	886	" Now , my dear fellow , be a good boy , and learn your lesson well . You will soon meet with your reward . "
112541	112547	112549	112550	the baronet	26709	" I am all attention , "
112552	112565	112567	112567	Chichester	886	" In the first place I shall show you how to secure , "
112569	112647	112567	112567	Chichester	886	" and as you know the game of Hazard well enough , I need say but little more on that head . There are two ways of securing . The first is to hold one of the dice between the fore and middle fingers , or the middle and third fingers , against the side of the box , so that one finger must cover the top of the die — in this way , you see . "
112648	112652	112654	112655	the baronet	26709	" I understand , "
112683	112701	112703	112703	Chichester	886	" This system is not so easy as the second , which I shall presently show you , "
112705	112797	112703	112703	Chichester	886	" because the die must be kept cleverly inside the box , so as not to be seen . The second way of securing is by taking hold of one of the dice by the little finger , and keeping it firm against the palm of the hand while you shake the box , so as to be able to drop it skilfully upon the table at the proper moment , when it will seem as if it came from the box along with the other . This is the way . "
112798	112804	112806	112807	the baronet	26709	" I shall soon understand , "
112809	112831	112806	112807	the baronet	26709	" Of course by being able to secure one die , you may make it turn up any number you choose . "
112832	112841	112843	112843	Chichester	886	" When you mean to practise this dodge , "
112845	112939	112843	112843	Chichester	886	" call five for a main ; because you can secure the four , and there is only the six on the loose die that can come up against you . If you have a good stake to get , secure a five every time ; because when the main is six to five , or seven to five , or eight to five , or nine to five , or ten to five , you must win every time , because you ca n't possibly throw out while the five is secured . "
112940	112960	112962	112963	the baronet	26709	" But will not the ear tell the pigeon that there is only one die rattling in the box ? "
112965	112971	112973	112973	Chichester	886	" Look at this box , "
112975	113000	112973	112973	Chichester	886	" It has two rims cut inside , near the bottom : the one die shaking against them produces the sound of two dice . "
113001	113011	113013	113014	Sir Rupert	887	" Are there not some peculiarities about these dice ? "
113029	113118	113013	113014	Sir Rupert	887	" Yes — those are unequal dice , and are so well made that no one , except a regular sharper , could detect them . They are bigger at one end than the other , and the sixes are placed on the smaller squares , because you must play with these dice to win upon high numbers , which are on those smaller squares . The dice will in nine cases out of ten fall upon the larger squares , and thus show the high numbers uppermost . "
113119	113124	113126	113127	the baronet	26709	" And these dice ? "
113134	113138	113140	113140	Chichester	886	" Loaded ones , "
113142	113165	113140	113140	Chichester	886	" These are to throw low ; and so the two sides which have got four and five on them are loaded . "
113166	113172	113174	113175	Sir Rupert	887	" How are they loaded ? "
113177	113295	113174	113175	Sir Rupert	887	" The corner pip of the four side , next to the five side , is bored very neatly to a certain depth : the same is done to the corner pip of the five side , adjoining the four side . Thus the two holes , so bored , meet each other at right angles . One of the holes is covered over with some strong cement : quicksilver is then poured in ; and the other hole is covered over with the cement . The spots are blackened ; and your dice are ready for use . These being intended to throw low , you must call a main , and take the odds accordingly . "
113296	113299	113301	113302	the baronet	26709	" Well , "
113304	113341	113301	113302	the baronet	26709	" I think I can now safely say that I know enough of the elements of your grammar to enable me to practise myself . Let us devote half an hour to the working of cards . "
113342	113350	113352	113352	Chichester	886	" The ways of managing the cards , "
113363	113425	113352	113352	Chichester	886	" are numerous . These , for instance , are Longs and Shorts . All the cards above the eight , are the least thing longer than those below it . I have a machine which was invented on purpose to cut them accurately . Nothing under an eight can be cut , you see , with these cards , lengthways . "
113426	113438	113301	113302	the baronet	26709	" And that pack so carefully wrapped up in the paper ? "
113439	113494	113301	113302	the baronet	26709	" Oh ! these are my Concaves and Convexes . All from the two to the seven are cut concave ; and all from the eight to the king are cut convex . By cutting the pack breadthways a convex card is cut ; by cutting it lengthways , a concave one is secured . "
113495	113504	113506	113507	Sir Rupert	887	" I have often heard of the bridge , "
113509	113515	113506	113507	Sir Rupert	887	" what does that mean ? "
113516	113527	113529	113529	Chichester	886	" Oh ! the bridge is simply and easily done , "
113541	113581	113301	113302	the baronet	26709	" You see it is nothing but slightly curving a card , and introducing it carelessly into the pack . Shuffle the cards as your opponent will , you are sure to be able to cut the bridged one . "
113582	113590	113592	113594	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" I could do that without study , "
113596	113603	113592	113594	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" Is my initiation now complete ? "
113604	113614	113616	113616	Chichester	886	" There are several other schemes with the cards , "
113618	113717	113616	113616	Chichester	886	" but I think that I have taught you enough for this evening . One famous device , however , must not be forgotten . You have heard of the way in which Lord de Roos lately attempted to cheat his noble companions at the club ? The plan practised by him is called sauter la coupe , and enables the dealer to do what he chooses with one particular card , which of course he has selected for this purpose . Now look how it is done ; for I can better show practically than explain verbally . "
113760	113770	113772	113776	the one to the other	4720	" They ca n't have found us out here ? "
113784	113790	113772	113776	the one to the other	4720	" What shall we do ? "
113791	113800	113801	113801	Chichester	886	" We must open — happen what will . "
113815	113820	113822	113822	one	2053	" Mr. Arthur Chichester ? "
113824	113849	113851	113851	Chichester	886	" He is n't here — we do n't know him . My name is Davis — ask the landlady if it is not , "
113870	113881	113883	113884	the bailiff	4725	" Come — come , none of that there gammon , "
113886	113942	113883	113884	the bailiff	4725	" I knows you well enough : my name 's Garnell ; and I 'll stand the risk of your being Chichester . Here 's execution out against you for four hundred and forty - seven pounds . I do n't suppose that you can pay — so you 'd better come off at once . "
113943	113947	113949	113949	Chichester	886	" Where to ? "
113964	113968	113970	113971	the officer	2833	" Where to ! "
113973	113991	113970	113971	the officer	2833	" why — to Whitecross , to be sure ! Where the devil would you go to ? "
113992	114006	113883	113884	the bailiff	4725	" Can I not be allowed to sleep in a sponging - house ? "
114007	114029	113970	113971	the officer	2833	" No — this is an execution , and a large sum , mind . I do n't dare do it . "
114030	114041	114043	114043	Chichester	886	" Well , then — here goes for Whitecross Street ! "
114182	114201	114172	114173	The officer	2833	" it was lucky he had been taken so close to the prison on such a rainy night . "
114353	114357	114338	114339	The turnkey	28502	" Who rings ? "
114368	114378	114380	114381	the turnkey	28502	" Sheriffs debtor — Arthur Chichester — L. S. , "
114571	114577	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" What is your name ? "
114578	114582	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" Arthur Chichester . "
114583	114590	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" Have you got your bread ? "
114591	114594	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" Yes . "
114595	114619	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" Well — put it in that pigeon - hole . Do you choose to have sheets to - night on your bed ? "
114620	114623	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" Certainly . "
114624	114707	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" Then that will be a shilling the first night , and sixpence every night after , as long as you remain here . You can , moreover , sleep in the inner room , and sit up till twelve o'clock . Those who ca n't afford to pay for sheets sleep in a room by themselves , and go to bed at a quarter to ten . You see we know how to separate the gentlemen from the riff - raff . "
114708	114724	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" And how long shall I be allowed to stay up in the Receiving Ward ? "
114725	114761	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" That depends . Do you mean to live at my table ? I charge sixpence for tea , the same for breakfast , a shilling for dinner , and four - pence for supper . "
114762	114776	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" Well — I shall be most happy to live at your table . "
114777	114826	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" In that case , write a note to the governor , to say you are certain to be able to settle your affairs in the course of a week ; and I will take care he shall have it the very first thing to - morrow morning . "
114827	114842	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" But I am sure of not being able to settle in a week . "
114843	114862	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" Do as you like . You wo n't be allowed to stay up here unless you do . "
114863	114888	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" Oh ! in that case I will do so at once . Can you oblige me with a sheet of writing - paper ? "
114889	114903	114567	114568	the steward	4776	" Certainly . Here is one . A penny , if you please . "
114997	115050	114981	114982	The Steward	4776	said,—"Those gentlemen at the fire are Sheriff 's Debtors , and live at my table : those chaps over there are Court of Requests ' Men , and have n't a shilling to bless themselves with . So , of course , I ca n't allow them to associate with the others . "
115051	115072	114981	114982	The Steward	4776	" How many prisoners , upon an average , pass through the Receiving Ward in the course of one year ? "
115073	115113	114981	114982	The Steward	4776	" About three thousand three hundred as near as I can guess . All the Debtors receive each so much bread and meat a - week . The prison costs the City close upon nine thousand pounds a year . "
115114	115132	115134	115134	Chichester	886	" Nine thousand a - year , spent to lock men up , away from their families ! "
115136	115158	115134	115134	Chichester	886	" That sum would pay the debts of the greater portion of those who are unfortunate enough to be brought here . "
115159	115166	115168	115169	the Steward	4776	" You may well say that , "
115171	115237	115168	115169	the Steward	4776	" Why , half the prisoners who come here are poor working - men , snatched away from their labour , and obliged to know that their wives and children will starve during their absence . That man over there , with the little bundle tied up in a blue cotton handkerchief , is only arrested for 8d . The costs are three and sixpence . "
115238	115254	114981	114982	The Steward	4776	" He is actually a prisoner , then , for four and two - pence . "
115255	115473	115168	115169	the Steward	4776	" Exactly . The man next to him is arrested for 3d . , the balance of a chandler 's shop debt ; his costs are five shillings . But the case of that poor devil who is crying so up in the corner , is the worst . It appears that he had an account at a tally - shop , and paid one shilling a - week towards its liquidation . He was in full work , and earned eighteen shillings a week ; and so he regularly gave his wife the money every Saturday night to put away for the tally - man . But the woman is fund of tippling , and she spent the money in gin . Well , the tally - man takes out a summons from the Court of Requests : the wife receives it , and is afraid to tell her husband . Next week comes the Rule : this the woman also hides , hoping , somehow or another , to get together the debt and costs , and settle it unknown to her husband . But no such thing : so this morning , as the poor fellow was going home to dinner , he was arrested for four shillings debt , and six shillings costs . "
115474	115480	115482	115482	Chichester	886	" This was cruel indeed , "
115493	115496	115498	115499	the Steward	4776	" Yes , "
115501	115541	115498	115499	the Steward	4776	" but that is nothing to the things that I have heard men tell up in this room . Loan - Societies , Tally - Shops , and the low pettifogging lawyers , keep this place well - filled . "
115573	115583	115168	115169	the Steward	4776	" gentlemen who boarded at the Steward 's table , "
116583	116589	116591	116592	the Steward	4776	" Well , Mr. Thaynes , "
116602	116623	116591	116592	the Steward	4776	" I began to think we should have had none down this morning . Pray take a seat , sir . "
116672	116724	116661	116661	himself	4776	said—"These are our rules and regulations . Every new member is required to pay an entrance fee of one pound and sixpence ; and this goes towards the fund for paying the officers and servants of the ward , providing coals , and administering generally to the comforts of the place . "
116725	116737	116739	116739	Chichester	886	" I am quite satisfied with the justice of the charge , "
116747	116757	116759	116760	the Steward	4776	" I suppose you will live at my table ? "
116762	116772	116759	116760	the Steward	4776	" Same charges as upstairs in the Receiving Ward . "
116773	116778	116780	116780	Chichester	886	" Oh ! certainly , "
116782	116794	116780	116780	Chichester	886	" Have you any body here of any consequence at all ? "
116795	116822	116759	116760	the Steward	4776	" Not particularly at this moment . Lord William Priggins stayed a couple of days with us , and went over to the Bench yesterday morning . "
116823	116837	116839	116839	Chichester	886	" Who is that gentleman walking up and down the narrow court outside ? "
116889	116926	116839	116839	Chichester	886	" Oh ! that is Count Pichantoss — a celebrated Russian nobleman , who was cleaned out some weeks since at a West - end Hell , and got put into prison for his hotel bill . "
116927	116945	116839	116839	Chichester	886	" And who is that respectable old gentleman with the bald head , and dressed in black ? "
116946	116981	116839	116839	Chichester	886	" That is a clergyman , the Rev. Henry Sharpere : he is an excellent preacher , they say — and the best securer of a die that I ever saw in my life . "
116982	116999	116839	116839	Chichester	886	" And that very sickly pale - faced youth , who seems to be scarcely twenty ? "
117000	117052	116839	116839	Chichester	886	" He is only twenty - one and a month . He was arrested the day after he came of age for blank acceptances which he had given , during his minority , to the tune of three thousand pounds , and for which he never received more than three hundred . "
117053	117067	116839	116839	Chichester	886	" And that quiet - looking old gentleman , at the table opposite ? "
117068	117416	116839	116839	Chichester	886	" He is a Chancery prisoner — committed for contempt . It appears that he was one morning walking by the Auction Mart , and saw large posting - bills announcing the immediate sale of an estate , consisting of thirteen houses , somewhere in Finsbury , under a decree of the Court of Chancery . My gentleman had n't a guinea in his pocket , nor the means of raising one at the time . Nevertheless he walked into the Mart as bold as brass , strode up stairs to the auctioneer 's rooms , and bid for the estate . There were plenty of competitors ; but he did n't care — he bid away ; and at last the estate was knocked down to him for four thousand three hundred pounds . When sales are effected under an order of the Chancellor , no deposit - money is required . This may seem strange to you ; but it is not the less a fact . So off walks my gentleman , quite rejoiced at his bargain . The first thing he does is to go and collect all the arrears of rent he can from the tenants of the houses , and to distrain upon those who could n't or would n't pay . Lord ! what a game he did play , to be sure ! He called into request the services of half the brokers in Finsbury , and made the tenants cash up to the very last farthing that was due . Well , the lawyers employed for the sale of the estate , drew up the deeds of conveyance and the abstract of the title ; but my gentleman never meant paying — so at last , the Chancery Court , getting tired of his excuses , and finding that he would not disgorge the amount he had already received for rents , nor yet come down with a shilling towards the purchase - money , clapt him into limbo under some form or another;—and so here he is .

121013	121030	121371	121373	the wretched murderer	5048	" It is now half - past seven . He is about now receiving the sacrament . "
121031	121055	121371	121373	the wretched murderer	5048	" Well — if I was he , I 'd send the old parson to the devil , and pitch into the sheriffs . "
121056	121091	121371	121373	the wretched murderer	5048	" Yes — so would I. For my part , I should like to live such a life as Jack Sheppard or Dick Turpin did , even if I did get hanged at last . "
121092	121130	121371	121373	the wretched murderer	5048	" There is something noble and exciting in the existence of a highwayman : and then — at last — what admiration on the part of the crowd — what applause when he appears upon the drop ! "
121131	121180	121371	121373	the wretched murderer	5048	" Yes . If this fellow Bolter had contented himself with being a burglar , or had only murdered those who resisted him , I should have cheered him heartily;—but to kill his wife — there 's something cowardly in that ; and so I shall hiss him . "
121181	121186	121371	121373	the wretched murderer	5048	" And so shall I. "
121187	121203	121371	121373	the wretched murderer	5048	" A quarter to eight ! The poor devil 's minutes are pretty well numbered . "
121204	121213	121371	121373	the wretched murderer	5048	" I wonder what he is about now . "
121214	121225	121371	121373	the wretched murderer	5048	" The pinioning will begin directly , I dare say . "
121226	121234	121371	121373	the wretched murderer	5048	" That must be the worst part . "
121235	121289	121371	121373	the wretched murderer	5048	" Oh ! no — not a bit of it . You may depend upon it that he is not half so miserable as we are inclined to think him . A man makes up his mind to die as well as to anything else . But what the devil noise is that ? "
121290	121327	121371	121373	the wretched murderer	5048	" Oh ! only some fool of a fellow singing a patter song about a man hanging , and imitating all the convulsions of the poor wretch . My eyes ! how the people do laugh ! "

123978	123986	123987	123987	he	874	" I should have thought , sir , "
123991	124014	123987	123987	he	874	" that you , who professed yourself so convinced of my innocence , would have received me with a smile of welcome ! "
124015	124022	124024	124026	the old man	2222	" My dear — dear boy , "
124028	124095	124024	124026	the old man	2222	" God knows I am rejoiced to hail your freedom ; and that same Almighty power can also attest to my sincere conviction of your innocence . Believe me , I would go through fire and water to serve you,—I would lay down my life , miserable and valueless as it is , to benefit you;—but , oh ! I cannot — cannot support your presence ! "
124109	124113	124115	124115	Richard	874	" I presume , "
124140	124183	124295	124295	he	874	listen,—"I presume that you scorn the man who has been convicted of felony ? It is natural , sir — it is natural ; but such a demonstration of aversion is not the less calculated to wound one who never injured you . "
124184	124242	124295	124295	he	874	" No — no , Richard ; you never injured me ; and that makes me feel the more acutely now . But — hear me . I take God to witness that I love you as my own son , and that I am above such unnatural conduct as that which you would impute to me . "
124243	124247	124249	124249	Markham	874	" My God ! "
124253	124288	124249	124249	Markham	874	" what does all this mean ? Are you ill ? Has anything unpleasant occurred ? If so , we will postpone all discussion upon my affairs until a period more agreeable to yourself . "
124349	124363	124346	124346	he	874	" My dear sir , you have evidently been very — very ill ! "

124606	124618	124603	124604	Mr. Monroe	885	" and can not say whether he be dead or living . "
124619	124633	124635	124635	Markham	874	" Thank God , you have nothing terrible to communicate relative to him , "
124673	124685	124687	124689	the old man	2222	" But I will not keep you in suspense , Richard , "
124691	124708	124687	124689	the old man	2222	" it is better for me to unburthen my mind at once . You are ruined ! "
124709	124712	124714	124714	Markham	874	" Ruined ! "
124768	124771	124772	124772	he	874	" Ruined ! "
124782	124842	124779	124779	he	874	" Aye ! ruined in reputation , doubtless ; but rich in the possessions which this world principally esteems . My property was all vested in you by my deceased father — I was not of age when I was condemned — and consequently the law could not touch my fortune when it filched from me my good name ! "
124843	124852	124854	124855	Mr. Monroe	885	" Ruined — ruined in property and all ! "
124859	124883	124779	124779	he	874	" Unfortunate speculations on my part , but in your interest , have consumed the vast property entrusted to me by your father ! "
125063	125083	125041	125041	Markham	874	" Tell me how all this has happened ; let me know the circumstances which led to this calamity . "
125084	125089	125091	125091	Monroe	885	" They are brief , "
125093	125532	125091	125091	Monroe	885	" and will convince you that I am more to be pitied than blamed . Long previous to your unfortunate trial I commenced a series of speculations with my own property , all of which turned out unhappily . The year 1832 was a fatal one to many old - established houses ; and mine was menaced with absolute ruin . In an evil hour I listened to the advice of a Mr. Allen , a merchant who had been reduced by great losses in America trading ; and by his counsel , I employed a small portion of your property with the view of recovering my own , and augmenting your wealth at the same time . Allen acted as my agent in these new speculations . At first we were eminently successful ; I speedily released myself from difficulty , and doubled the sum that I had borrowed from your fortune . At the beginning of 1836 Mr. Allen heard of a gentleman who required the loan of a considerable sum of money to work a patent which was represented to be a perfect mine of gold . Mr. Allen and I consulted upon the eligibility of embarking money in this enterprise : in a word , we were dazzled by the immense advantages to be derived from the speculation . At that time — it was shortly after your trial and sentence , Richard — I was ill and confined to my bed . Mr. Allen therefore managed this for me ; and it is an extraordinary fact that I have never once seen the individual to whom I lent an enormous sum of money — for I did advance the sum required by that person ; and I drew largely upon your fortune to procure it ! Oh ! Richard — had this speculation succeeded , I should have been a wealthy man once more , and your property would have been more than doubled . But , alas ! this individual to whom I advanced that immense amount , and whose securities I had fancied unexceptionable , defrauded me in the most barefaced manner ! And yet the law could not touch him , for he had contrived to associate Allen 's name with his own as a partner in the enterprise . Rendered desperate by this appalling loss , I embarked in the most extravagant speculations with the remainder of your money . The infatuation of the gambler seized upon me : and I never stopped until the result was ruin — total ruin to me , and comparative ruin to you ! "
125533	125541	125543	125543	Markham	874	" Comparative ruin — only comparative ruin ! "
125554	125603	125545	125545	his	874	" is there any thing left from the wrecks of my property — is there any thing available still remaining ? Speak;—and if you answer me in the affirmative — if you announce the existence of never so small a pittance , I will yet forgive you all ! "
125604	125617	125619	125621	the old man	2222	" This house and the small estate attached to it are left , "
125623	125638	125619	125621	the old man	2222	" and totally unincumbered . I neither could nor would touch your paternal possessions . "
125672	125682	125684	125684	Markham	874	" Thank God , I am not totally ruined ! "
125686	125819	125684	125684	Markham	874	" I can at least bury myself in this retreat ; — I can daily ascend that hill where the memorials of fraternal affection stand;—and I can there hope for the return of my brother ! My dear sir , what has been done can not be recalled : reproaches , even were I inclined to offer any , would be useless ; and regrets would be equally unavailing . This estate will produce me a small income — but enough for my wants . Two hundred pounds a - year are certainly a beggar 's pittance , when compared with the inheritance which my father left me;—but I am still grateful that even the means of subsistence are left . And you , Mr. Monroe — upon what are you subsisting ? "
125820	125831	125833	125835	the old man	2222	" I still attend to the wrecks of my affairs , "
125837	125855	125833	125835	the old man	2222	" and then I have my daughter Ellen — who earns a little with her needle — — "
125856	125878	125880	125883	the generous young man	5203	" You shall come and take up your abode with me — you and your daughter — and share my income , "
125960	125974	125976	125976	Richard	874	" You have not told me what became of your friend Mr. Allen , "
125982	125992	125976	125976	Richard	874	" He was an honourable and an upright man , "
125997	126026	125976	125976	Richard	874	" and the ruin which he had been the means of entailing , though innocently , upon me , broke his heart , he died three months ago . "
126027	126047	125976	125976	Richard	874	" And what became of the infamous cheat whose schemes have thus killed one person and ruined two others ? "
126048	126053	126055	126056	Mr. Monroe	885	" I know not , "
126058	126138	126055	126056	Mr. Monroe	885	" I never saw him myself ; nor did he even know that there was such a person as myself connected with the loan which he received . Certain commercial reasons — too long to be explained now — made me put forward Allen as the person who advanced the money , and conducted the entire business as a principal , and not as an agent . Thus no communication ever took place between me and this George Montague . "
126139	126143	126145	126145	Richard	874	" George Montague ! "
126147	126159	126145	126145	Richard	874	" Yes — he was the villain who has plundered us . "
126160	126165	126167	126167	Richard	874	" George Montague again ! "
126180	126235	126170	126170	he	874	" Why is it that this name should constantly obtrude itself upon my notice ? wherefore should I be perpetually condemned to hear it uttered , and always coupled with epithets of abhorrence and reproach ? and why should I be amongst the number of that miscreant 's victims ? Strange combination of circumstances ! "
126236	126244	126246	126247	his guardian	28256	" Are you acquainted with this Montague ? "
126249	126261	126246	126247	his guardian	28256	" the name seemed to produce a singular effect upon you . "
126262	126280	126282	126282	Markham	874	" I am not acquainted with him : like you , I have never even seen him , "
126284	126334	126282	126282	Markham	874	" But I have heard much concerning him ; and all that I have heard is evil . Surely — surely justice will some day overtake a miscreant who is constantly preying upon society , and who enriches himself at the expense of his fellow - creatures ' happiness ! "
126755	126758	126720	126724	many great and good men	5237	" Freed Convict "
126893	126901	126903	126903	Richard	874	" Thank God ! my brother lives ! "
126910	127048	126903	126903	Richard	874	" This is an intimation of his remembrance of me ! But — oh ! why did he desert me in my need ? wherefore came he not to see me in my prison ? Alas ! years must yet elapse ere I clasp him to my heart ! Let me not repine — let me not reproach him without hearing his justification ! He has revisited the hill ; and he chose a sacred day for what he no doubt deemed a sacred duty ! It was on the anniversary of the nativity of the Saviour that he came back to the scenes of his youth ! Oh , Eugene ! I thank thee for this : it is an assurance that the appointment on the 10th of July , 1843 , will be punctually kept ! "
127203	127217	127219	127219	Armstrong	994	" You see I have found you out , my dear young friend , "
127221	127297	127219	127219	Armstrong	994	" I miscalculated the date of your release from that abominable hole , and a few weeks ago was waiting for hours one day in Giltspur Street to welcome you to freedom . At length I did what I ought to have done at first — that is , inquired of the turnkeys whether you were to be released that day or not : and , behold — I found that the bird had flown . "
127298	127306	127308	127308	Richard	874	" I should have written to you , "
127310	127334	127308	127308	Richard	874	" for you were kind enough to give me your address ; but really my mind has been so bent upon solitude — — "
127335	127340	127342	127342	Armstrong	994	" From which solitude , "
127346	127369	127342	127342	Armstrong	994	" I am come to drag you away . Will you allow me to dispose of the next ten days for you ? "
127370	127380	127382	127382	Markham	874	" How do you mean , my good friend ? "
127384	127419	127382	127382	Markham	874	" I mean that you shall pass that time with me at the house of a friend at Richmond . Solitude and seclusion will never wean you from the contemplation of your past sorrows . "
127420	127433	127435	127435	Richard	874	" But you know that I can not go into society again , "
127437	127460	127462	127464	the old gentleman	28483	" This is absurd , Markham . I will hear no apologies : you must and shall place yourself at my disposal , "
127474	127485	127487	127487	Markham	874	" But to whom do you wish to introduce me ? "
127489	127763	127487	127487	Markham	874	" To an Italian emigrant , who has only just arrived in this country , with his family , but the honour of whose friendship I have enjoyed for many , many years . I must tell you that I have travelled much ; and that Italy has always been a country which has excited my warmest sympathy . It was at Montoni , the capital of the Grand Duchy of Castelcicala that I first met Count Alteroni ; and his extremely liberal political opinions , which completely coincide with my own , were the foundation of a staunch friendship between us . Ten years ago he was compelled to fly from his native land ; and he sought refuge in England . His only child — a beautiful girl of the name of Isabella — thus obtained an English education and speaks the language with fluency . Two years ago , he was allowed to return to Castelcicala ; but a few months back fresh political events in that state forced him once more to become an exile . He arrived in England a month ago , and has taken a small but commodious and picturesque residence at Richmond . His means are ample , but not vast ; and he therefore lives in comparative seclusion — other reasons , moreover , inducing him to avoid the pomp and ostentation which noblemen of his rank usually maintain . Thus , in addressing him , you must drop the formality of My Lord ; and remember also that his daughter chooses to be called simply , Miss Isabella , or the Signora Isabella . "
127764	127800	127802	127802	Richard	874	" And how can I venture to present myself to this nobleman of high rank , and his wife and daughter , knowing that but a few weeks ago I was liberated from a gaol ? "
127807	127825	127827	127827	Armstrong	994	" The count has not heard of your misfortune , and is not likely to do so , "
127829	128029	127827	127827	Armstrong	994	" He pressed me yesterday to pass a few days with him ; and I happened to mention that I was about to visit a young friend — meaning yourself — in whom I felt a deep interest . I then gave him such an account of you that he expressed a desire to form your acquaintance . Thus , you perceive , that I am taking no unwarranted liberty in introducing you to his house . As for the danger which you incur of your history being known , that can not be avoided ; and it is a point which you may as well risk now as upon any future occasion . A man of the world must always be prepared for reverses of this kind , and I think that I am not mistaken in you , Markham , when I express my opinion that you would know how to vindicate your character and assert your innocence in a manner which would disarm resentment and conquer prejudice . At least , assume as cheerful an appearance as possible ; and , believe me , you will find yourself right welcome at the dwelling of Count Alteroni . "
129179	129195	129197	129198	the count	26666	" You reside in a very pleasant and healthy part of London , Mr. Markham , "
129200	129243	129197	129198	the count	26666	" I am well acquainted with the situation of your mansion and grounds , from the description which my friend Armstrong has given me . The house stands close by a hill , on the summit of which there are two trees . "
129244	129249	129197	129198	the count	26666	" Ah , indeed ! "
129255	129300	129251	129253	Sir Cherry Bounce	1051	" The other day I wode by there for the firtht time in my life ; and I remember the houth ith veway beautifully thithuate in the neighbourwood of the bill dethwibed by the count , and with two ath tweeth on the top . "
129301	129307	129309	129309	Richard	874	" That is my house , "
129311	129326	129309	129309	Richard	874	" But it is an antiquated , gloomy - looking pile ; but — — "
129327	129370	129251	129253	Sir Cherry Bounce	1051	" Oh ! I beg your pardon , thir ; it is the thweeteth little plaith I ever thaw . I never thaw it but that time , and wath thwuck with the weway wemarkable appearanth of the hill and the tweeth . "
129371	129385	129387	129387	Markham	874	" Those trees were planted many years ago by my brother and myself , "
129399	129415	129387	129387	Markham	874	" and they yet remain there as the trysting - mark for a strange appointment . "
129416	129419	129421	129422	the count	26666	" Indeed ! "
129450	129544	129437	129437	he	874	" It is nearly seven years since that event took place . My elder brother disputed with my father , and determined to leave home and choose some career for himself , which he hoped might lead to fortune . He and I parted upon that hill , beneath those trees , with the understanding that in twelve years we were to meet again upon that same spot , and then compare our respective fortunes and worldly positions . On the 10th of July , 1843 , that appointment is to be kept . "
129545	129565	129567	129567	Isabella	1048	" And during the seven years which have already elapsed , have you received no tidings of your brother ? "
129569	129573	129575	129575	Markham	874	" None direct , "
129577	129621	129575	129575	Markham	874	" All that I know is that on Christmas - day , 1836 , he was alive ; for he went to the hill , while I was absent from home , and carved his name upon the tree that he himself planted . "
129622	129640	129642	129643	Captain Dapper	1053	" Strike me stupid , if that is n't the most romantic thing I ever heard of ! "
129649	129668	129642	129643	Captain Dapper	1053	" You ought to wite a copy of vertheth upon the wemarkable inthident , in Mith Ithabella'th Album , "
129674	129695	129697	129698	the captain	5310	" So I would , strike me ! if I was half such a good poet as you , Cherry , "
129700	129718	129720	129722	the effeminate baronet	5311	" You wote thum veway pwetty poetry the other day upon the Gweat Thea Therpenth , Thmilackth , "
129724	129742	129720	129722	the effeminate baronet	5311	" and I do n't know why you thouldn't do the thame by the two ath tweeth . "
129743	129764	129766	129767	the captain	5310	" Yes ; but — strike me ugly ! Miss Isabella would not let me insert them in her Album , "
129769	129776	129766	129767	the captain	5310	" and that was very unkind . "
129777	129791	129793	129794	the count	26666	" Bella says that you undertook to finish a butterfly and spoilt it , "
129797	129811	129813	129814	Sir Cherry	1051	" And now it theemth for all the world like an enormouth fwog , "
129816	129828	129830	129831	the captain	5310	" Now , really , Bounce , that is too bad ! "
129838	129856	129830	129831	the captain	5310	" I appeal to the signora herself , whether the butterfly was so very — very bad ? "
129857	129866	129868	129870	the young lady	4262	" Considering it to be your first attempt , "
129872	129898	129868	129870	the young lady	4262	" it was not so very much amiss ; and I must say that I preferred the butterfly to the lines upon the Sea Serpent . "
129899	129906	129908	129909	the hussar	5316	" Well , may I perish , "
129911	129951	129908	129909	the hussar	5316	" if I think the lines were so bad . But we will refer them to Mr. Markham;—not that I dispute Miss Isabella 's judgment : I 'd rather have my moustachios singed than do that ! But — — "
129952	129959	129961	129962	Sir Cherry	1051	" The vertheth ! the vertheth ! "
129964	129980	129982	129982	Markham	874	" I am afraid that my talent does not justify such a reference to it , "
129984	130001	129982	129982	Markham	874	" and I should rather imagine that Miss Isabella 's decision will admit of no appeal . "
130002	130036	129908	129909	the hussar	5316	" My dear thir , we will have your opinion . The vertheth were compothed in a hurway ; and they may not be quite tho ekthellent and faultleth ath they might be . "
130037	130053	129982	129982	Markham	874	" I only devoted half an hour to them , strike me if I did ! "
130054	130063	130065	130070	the effeminate young baronet of nineteen	5317	" Let'th thee — how do they begin ? "
130072	130085	130065	130070	the effeminate young baronet of nineteen	5317	" Oh ! I wemember — the opening ith thimple but ekpwethive : "
130091	130096	129982	129982	Markham	874	" interrupted the captain , "
130124	130132	130134	130135	Sir Cherry	1051	" No , that ithn't the way , "
130137	130152	130134	130135	Sir Cherry	1051	" Well , strike me , if I 'll say another word more then , "
130166	130184	130186	130186	Armstrong	994	" I am sure Miss Isabella was wrong not to have inserted these verses in her album , "
130197	130226	130186	130186	Armstrong	994	" But I know that my young friend , Mr. Markham , has a more refined taste with regard to poetry than he chose just now to admit . "
130227	130230	130232	130234	the beautiful Isabella	1048	" Indeed ! "
130236	130323	130232	130234	the beautiful Isabella	1048	" I should be delighted to hear Mr. Markham 's sentiments upon the subject of poetry ; for I confess that I myself entertain very singular notions in that respect . It is difficult to afford a minute definition of what poetry is ; for , like the unearthly visitants which the fears of superstition have occasionally summoned to the world , poetry fascinates the senses , but eludes the grasp of the beholder , and stands before him visible , powerful , and yet impalpable ! "
130324	130334	130336	130336	Markham	874	" I concur with your views , Miss Isabella , "
130357	130392	130232	130234	the beautiful Isabella	1048	" It is impossible to set forth , in any array of words , the subtlety and peculiarity of poetry , which soars above the powers of language and defies the reach of description . "
130393	130396	130398	130398	Isabella	1048	" Yes , "
130400	130438	130398	130398	Isabella	1048	" the painter can not place the rainbow or the glittering dew - drop upon his canvass ; the sculptor can not invest his image with a soul ; and it seems equally difficult to define poetry . "
130439	130467	130232	130234	the beautiful Isabella	1048	" We know of what we are speaking when we allude to it ; but there are no definitions which give us views of it sufficiently comprehensive . "
130468	130496	130498	130501	the captain of hussars	5318	" Well , strike me ! if I did n't think that every thing with rhymes , or in lines of a certain length , was poetry , "
130503	130513	130515	130516	the countess	5273	" My daughter can explain the mystery to you , "
130997	131006	131007	131007	she	1048	" because Captain Dapper did n't know when ; "
131023	131038	131007	131007	she	1048	" because Captain Dapper was constantly leaving her to play Sir Cherry some trick ; "
131135	131142	131144	131144	he	1053	" Cherry , my dear fellow , "
131174	131200	131144	131144	he	1053	" Cherry , my dear fellow , I have something upon my mind , strike me ! and I wish to unburden myself to you . "
131201	131214	131216	131217	the youth	2012	" Do you , Thmilackth ? What can pothibly be the matter ? "
131223	131248	131216	131217	the youth	2012	" Ith it veway terwible ? becauth if it ith , I had better call the count , and he will bwing hith blunderbuth . "
131249	131288	131144	131144	he	1053	" Strike me an idiot , Cherry , if you ai n't a fool with your counts and blunderbusses . Now listen to me ! I love Isabella , and have been doing the agreeable to her — — "
131289	131299	131144	131144	he	1053	" On my thoul I never could thee it ! "
131300	131409	131216	131217	the youth	2012	" I dare say not ! strike me , if I did n't keep it so precious snug and quiet ! However I love the girl ; and curse me if I do n't have her too — that 's more ! She shall be Mrs. Smilax Dapper , as sure as she 's born , and I hope the mother of a whole regiment of little Smilaxes . And then Cherry , you shall stay a month or six weeks with us at a time , and fondle the little ones on your knees , you shall , and every thing will go on comfortable and smooth . "
131410	131416	131418	131420	Sir Cherry Bounce	1051	" Oh ! veway thmooth ! "
131439	131496	131216	131217	the youth	2012	" And I suppose I am not presumptuous in aspiring to the hand of Isabella ? My father is a peer — and my uncle is a peer — and I have three thousand a - year of my own , beside expectations . Strike me , if I 'm a man to be sneezed at ! "
131497	131505	131216	131217	the youth	2012	" Who thinkth of thneething at you ? "
131506	131567	131216	131217	the youth	2012	" I do n't know exactly . And then I am not such a very bad looking fellow either . You are not ugly , Cherry , you are not — that is , not particularly ugly , although you have got pink eyes , and white lashes , and a pug nose;—but I 'm more athletic , strike me ! "
131568	131580	131216	131217	the youth	2012	" I 'm thure I do n't dithpute what you thay . "
131581	131589	131591	131592	the captain	5310	" Well then — acknowledging all this , "
131594	131608	131591	131592	the captain	5310	" how should I treat a fellow who endeavours to cut me out ? "
131609	131619	131621	131622	Sir Cherry	1051	" Thallenge him to fight with thword and pithtol , "
131624	131630	131621	131622	Sir Cherry	1051	" But who ith he ? "
131631	131682	131684	131685	the hussar	5316	" That upstart fellow , Markham , who was brought here by that odious , republican , seditious , disloyal scoundrel Armstrong , and who talks all day about poetry and music , and God knows what . However , I ca n't say I admire that plan of yours , "
131687	131703	131684	131685	the hussar	5316	" swords and pistols , you know are so very dangerous ; and — and — "
131704	131709	131621	131622	Sir Cherry	1051	" And what elth ? "
131710	131737	131621	131622	Sir Cherry	1051	" Why , you 're a fool , Cherry . I thought you would have hit upon some plan to enable me to secure the prize . "
131738	131754	131684	131685	the hussar	5316	" Well then — thuppothing we carwy the girl off , to Wochethter for inthanth . "
131755	131767	131621	131622	Sir Cherry	1051	" Deuce take Rochester ! my regiment is quartered at Chatham . "
131768	131775	131621	131622	Sir Cherry	1051	" Well — to Canterbury then ? "
131776	131791	131793	131794	the captain	5310	" Yes — that will do — strike me blind if it wo n't ! "
131796	131820	131793	131794	the captain	5310	" But if I could only get rid of this Markham somehow or another , I should prefer it . The fellow — — "
131853	131864	131866	131868	Sir Cherry Bounce	1051	" It wath'nt me — it wath'nt me who thpoke ! "
131897	131909	131911	131911	Richard	874	" Who was taking a most unwarrantable liberty with my name ? "
131921	131928	131930	131931	the captain	5310	" I certainly made an observation , "
131937	131949	131930	131931	the captain	5310	" and I do not hesitate to say , sir — — "
131950	131955	132017	132017	he	874	" What , sir ? "
131956	131973	131930	131931	the captain	5310	" Why , sir — that I feel , sir — that strike me , sir ! "
131974	131984	131988	131988	Markham	874	" Yes , sir — I shall strike you , "
131990	132015	131988	131988	Markham	874	" and that will teach you not to speak lightly of one , who is a comparative stranger to you , on another occasion . "
132927	132938	132943	132943	he	874	" Eugene , my brother — Eugene , dearest Eugene ! "
133255	133259	133261	133261	Richard	874	" My God ! "
133263	133270	133261	133261	Richard	874	" it was then no dream ! "
133375	133384	133386	133387	the count	26666	" I was anxious to see you again , "
133398	133442	133386	133387	the count	26666	" if it were only to joke you about the fright into which you threw poor Bounce the last time you were here . Isabel apprehended a duel between you and Dapper ; but we never could learn the origin of your dispute . "
133443	133453	133455	133455	Isabella	1048	" Indeed , I scarcely dreaded such an event , "
133457	133489	133455	133455	Isabella	1048	" for however capable Mr. Markham may be of fighting , I felt perfectly well convinced that Captain Dapper would not be induced to commit such a breach of the peace . "
133490	133498	133500	133500	Markham	874	" Our dispute was a mere trifle , "
133502	133514	133500	133500	Markham	874	" and I am sorry it should have reached your ears . "
133515	133524	133526	133527	the count	26666	" The Trojan war sprung from a trifle , "
133529	133538	133526	133527	the count	26666	" but these trifles are frequently very interesting . "
133539	133544	133546	133546	Richard	874	" The truth is , "
133548	133594	133546	133546	Richard	874	" that I overheard Captain Dapper abuse me to his companion , heaven only knows why ! Sir Cherry Bounce started away ; and I was compelled to give the young officer a couple of boxes upon the ears to teach him courtesy in future . "
133630	133642	133644	133645	the count	26666	" I shall not invite those gentlemen here very readily again , "
133647	133699	133644	133645	the count	26666	" I thought that they would have helped to pass away the time agreeably ; but one was such a fool , and the other such a fop , that I was really glad to get rid of them . However , I have now something else to occupy my attention . "
133700	133712	133714	133715	the countess	5273	" The count is going to speculate in an English Company , "
133717	133743	133714	133715	the countess	5273	" We foreigners , you know , Mr. Markham , are struck with the facility with which enormous fortunes are built up in your country . "
133744	133752	133754	133755	the count	26666	" Italy has lost all her commerce , "
133761	133765	133754	133755	the count	26666	" poor Italy ! "
133766	133775	133777	133777	Markham	874	" With all due deference to your experience , "
133779	133800	133777	133777	Markham	874	" I should counsel you to be particularly careful how you allow yourself to be deluded by visionaries and adventurers . "
133801	133878	133714	133715	the countess	5273	" Oh ! the gentleman who has proposed to me certain schemes for the realization of an immense fortune , is a man of probity and honour . The truth is , that the political condition of Italy may possibly compel me to remain an exile from my native land for the rest of my existence ; and I am anxious to turn the means now within my reach to the best advantage for my daughter . "
133879	133887	133889	133889	Isabella	1048	" You know , my dear father , "
133897	133911	133889	133889	Isabella	1048	" that I can be contented with a little — a very little . "
133912	133938	133940	133940	Richard	874	" I think I have before informed you that I lost a considerable portion of my own property through the nefarious speculations of an adventurer , "
133942	133991	133940	133940	Richard	874	" and I must confess that I look with a suspicious eye upon all schemes which induce us to change realities for chances . You possess , count , all that you require to make you happy during your exile;—why should you sigh and languish after immense wealth ? "
134047	134051	134053	134054	the count	26666	" I consider , "
134056	134124	134053	134054	the count	26666	" that a man is bound to do the best he can to increase the property he has to leave his offspring ; and as my own estate in Castelcicala is confiscated , and I have nothing to rely upon but a certain sum of ready - money , I am determined to vest the greater portion of it in an enterprize which will produce immense returns . "
134125	134136	134138	134138	Markham	874	" And what may the nature of the undertaking be ? "
134140	134184	134138	134138	Markham	874	" A line of steam - packets between London and Montoni , the capital of Castelcicala . Such an enterprize would absorb all the commerce now enjoyed by Leghorn and Civita Vecchia ; and Montoni would be the great mercantile port of Italy . "
134185	134192	134194	134194	Richard	874	" The scheme certainly seems plausible , "
134196	134237	134194	134194	Richard	874	" and , guided by your experience , may realize your expectations . I would rather see you embarking money in such an undertaking than in those desperate and outrageous ones which have nothing but their originality to recommend them . "
134308	134403	134296	134297	the count	26666	" I have this morning broken the ice : indeed , I have made the first plunge . I have confided the necessary funds to Mr. Greenwood — that is the name of the gentleman with whom I am to co - operate:—and he will immediately busy himself with the foundation of the enterprize . I shall not , however , mention this to the countess and Isabella for a few days ; for in commercial matters ladies always entertain apprehensions which give one what you English call the ' blue - devils . ' "
134873	134880	134881	134881	he	874	" Holloa , my fine fellow ! "
134894	134909	134881	134881	he	874	" you do n't mean to say that you have forgotten an old pal ? "
134910	134919	134921	134921	Markham	874	" What , Anthony — is this you ? "
134944	134989	134940	134942	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Yes — it is me — poor Tony Tidkins . But now permit me to ask you a question or two . What are you doing now ? Who lives there ? And what young girl was that you were walking about with ? "
134990	135005	135007	135007	Markham	874	" And by what right do you dare put those insolent queries to me ? "
135018	135042	135045	135047	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Oh ! if you do n't choose to answer my questions , I can precious soon ascertain all the truth for myself , "
135082	135092	135094	135094	Richard	874	" Wretch ! what do you mean to do ? "
135106	135152	135094	135094	Richard	874	" you do not know that that abode is sacred — that it is the residence of probity , innocence , and honour — that if you were to breathe a hint who and what you are , you would be spurned from the door ? "
135153	135175	135177	135179	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Ah ! I am accustomed to that in this Christian land — in this land of Bibles and Missionary Societies , "
135194	135267	135191	135191	he	3220	" But at all events I can first ask for alms and a morsel of bread at that house , and thereupon state that the gentleman who was just now walking with the young lady belonging to the house , was a companion of mine in Newgate — a communication which will tend to preserve the innocence , honour , probity , and all the rest of it , of that family . "
135284	135287	135289	135289	Markham	874	" Confusion ! "
135291	135300	135305	135305	he	3220	" this man will now effect my ruin ! "
135320	135339	135305	135305	he	3220	" Well — what now ? is n't a man at liberty to walk which way he chooses ? "
135340	135361	135363	135363	Richard	874	" You can not be so base as to betray me ? you would not ruin my happiness for ever ? "
135377	135401	135363	135363	Richard	874	" And why should I have any regard for you , since you receive and treat me as if I was a dog ? "
135402	135410	135421	135423	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I really did not mean — — "
135411	135419	135421	135423	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Oh ! bother to all apologies , "
135426	135444	135446	135446	Richard	874	" My God ! what do you want of me ? what can I do for you ? "
135540	135557	135559	135561	the Resurrection Man	952	" I may obtain from your fears what I should not have got from your generosity , "
135563	135581	135559	135561	the Resurrection Man	952	" but it does n't matter what motive produces it , so long as I get it . "
135582	135591	135593	135593	Richard	874	" And what is it that you require ? "
135596	135611	135593	135593	Richard	874	" But let us walk aside — they may see us from the windows . "
135612	135622	135625	135627	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And what do I care it they do ? "
135629	135647	135648	135648	he	874	" I suppose I sha n't suffer in character by talking to a companion in former misfortunes ? "
135735	135744	135746	135748	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Now I tell you what it is , "
135771	135806	135746	135748	the Resurrection Man	3220	" if you will only be civil I 'll accommodate you to the utmost of my power . Let us walk away from the house — we can then talk more at our ease . "
135832	135843	135845	135847	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You can , doubtless , suppose what I want ! "
135867	135873	135875	135875	Richard	874	" Money , I presume , "
135877	135911	135875	135875	Richard	874	" Yes — money . I know that you were in expectation of a great fortune when you were in Newgate ; and I suppose you have not run through it all yet . "
135912	135933	135935	135935	Markham	874	" I was almost totally ruined , during my imprisonment , by the unfortunate speculations in which my guardian engaged , "
135938	135972	135935	135935	Markham	874	" That 's all my eye ! Nevertheless , I wo n't be hard upon you : I know that you have got a splendid house and a grand estate close by — — "
135973	135986	135875	135875	Richard	874	" A few acres of land , as heaven is my witness ! "
135987	136063	135935	135935	Markham	874	" Well — you may try it on as much as you like ; but I tell you plainly it wo n't do for me . Let us cut this matter devilish short , and come to some understanding at once . I am hard up — I do n't know what to turn my hand to for a moment ; and I ca n't get orders for the stiff'uns as I used to do . "
136064	136081	136083	136083	Markham	874	" All that I have told you about the loss of my property is quite true , "
136085	136105	136083	136083	Markham	874	" and I have now but little more than a bare two hundred a - year to live upon . "
136106	136119	136121	136123	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Well , I will be generous and let you off easy , "
136125	136135	136121	136123	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You shall give me for the present — — "
136136	136141	136143	136143	Markham	874	" For the present ! "
136155	136181	136143	136143	Markham	874	" if I make any arrangement with you at all , it would be upon the express condition that you would never molest me more . "
136182	136187	136189	136197	the Resurrection Man , whom the promise cost nothing	5488	" Be it so , "
136214	136230	136143	136143	Markham	874	" give me five hundred pounds , and I will never seek you out again . "
136231	136236	136238	136238	Richard	874	" Five hundred pounds ! "
136240	136248	136238	136238	Richard	874	" I can not command the money ! "
136249	136258	136260	136261	the extortioner	5489	" Not a mag less will I take , "
136269	136365	136260	136261	the extortioner	5489	" I really can not comply with the proposal — I have not the money — I do not know where to get it . Why do you persecute me in this way ? what harm have I ever done to you ? why should you seek to ruin me , and to annihilate all my hopes of again establishing myself in an honourable position in society ? Tell me — by what right , by what law , do you now endeavour to extort — vilely , infamously extort — this money from me ? "
136471	136487	136493	136493	he	27409	" You want to know by what law and right I demand money of you , "
136511	136578	136493	136493	he	27409	" well — I will tell you . My law is that practised by all the world — the oppression of the weak by the strong ; and my right is also that of universal practice — the right of him who takes what will not dare to be refused . Now , then , you understand me ; and if not , hear my resolution . "
136579	136582	136584	136584	Richard	874	" Speak , "
136592	136602	136584	136584	Richard	874	" and let me know the worst at once . "
136603	136669	136493	136493	he	27409	" You have confirmed my suspicion that you are courting the young girl I saw you walking with : you have confirmed that suspicion by your manner and your words . Now , I require five hundred pounds ; and if you are anxious that your fair one should remain in ignorance of your Old Bailey adventures , you had better comply with my terms . "
136670	136681	136683	136683	Richard	874	" I positively declare that I have not the money , "
136685	136689	136683	136683	Richard	874	" Make it . "
136690	136694	136493	136493	he	27409	" But how ? "
136695	136713	136493	136493	he	27409	" Borrow it of the young lady 's father or mother , or uncle , or aunt . "
136714	136719	136493	136493	he	27409	" Never — impossible ! "
136720	136760	136493	136493	he	27409	" You say that you have a few acres of land left . I believe you have more ; but let 's take your own statement . Upon those few acres you can easily borrow the money I require . "
136761	136770	136493	136493	he	27409	" And diminish my miserable income still more ? "
136771	136798	136493	136493	he	27409	" Yes — or no , without further wrangling ? You must be well aware that this sacrifice is necessary if the girl is worth having . "
136799	136835	136837	136837	Markham	874	" In the name of heaven , allude not to — to — to Miss — — to the young lady with whom you saw me ere now;—allude not to her in this disgraceful manner ! "
136877	136885	136887	136889	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Will you give me the money ? "
136891	136921	136887	136889	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I will give you two hundred pounds — I have no more — I can get no more — I will not raise any more upon my property . "
136922	136928	136930	136931	the ruffian	2113	" Ca n't be done , "
136933	136944	136887	136889	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I will have the five hundred , or nothing . "
136945	136956	136958	136958	Markham	874	" It will take some days to procure the money , "
136963	136992	136958	136958	Markham	874	" Never mind . Give me what you have about you for my present purposes , and name the day and place for me to receive the rest . "
137036	137043	137045	137045	he	874	" Now this looks like business , "
137047	137069	137045	137045	he	874	" and is an earnest that you will do the thing that 's right . Where and when for the remainder ? "
137070	137087	137089	137089	Markham	874	" In a fortnight I will meet you at any place you may name in London , "
137091	137113	137089	137089	Markham	874	" Well , make it a fortnight . Do you know the Dark House , in Brick Lane , Bethnal Green ? "
137114	137119	137121	137121	Richard	874	" What is it ? "
137128	137200	137121	137121	Richard	874	" A public - house . Any one will tell you where it is . This day fortnight I shall expect to find you there at eight o'clock in the evening . If I do n't happen to be punctual , you can wait for me ; and if I do n't come that night , I shall the next . Remember how much depends upon your fulfilment of the contract . "
137201	137207	137209	137209	Richard	874	" I shall not fail , "
137231	137248	137121	137121	Richard	874	" And you , on your part , will adhere to your side of the agreement ? "
137249	137255	137257	137259	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Mute as a mouse , "
137261	137279	137257	137259	the Resurrection Man	3220	" and should I afterwards meet you by accident , I shall not know you . Farewell . "
137485	137494	137495	137495	he	2368	" as it was a debt of honour , "
137543	137585	137534	137535	another servant	5513	" If you please , sir , Mrs. Mangles has called , and is waiting below to see you . She has been here these three hours , and wishes very much to say a few words to you , sir . "
137586	137595	137597	137598	the gentleman	27107	" What ! that bothering upholsterer 's wife ! "
137624	137650	137534	137535	another servant	5513	" Why — her husband 's account has n't been owing quite a year yet ; and here she is boring from morning to night . "
137651	137670	137534	137535	another servant	5513	" Please , sir , she says that her husband is locked up in a spunging - house . "
137671	137676	137534	137535	another servant	5513	" Serve him right ! "
137677	137689	137534	137535	another servant	5513	" But he is a hard - working sober man — — "
137690	137698	137534	137535	another servant	5513	" He should n't run into debt . "
137699	137706	137534	137535	another servant	5513	" And he has five children . "
137707	137721	137534	137535	another servant	5513	" It is really disgusting ! these lower orders literally swarm with children ! "
137722	137743	137534	137535	another servant	5513	" And if you would only pay a quarter of the money , he would get out to - night . "
137744	137754	137534	137535	another servant	5513	" I wo n't pay a sixpence till January . "
137755	137769	137534	137535	another servant	5513	" Then he will be totally ruined , sir , his wife says . "
137770	137791	137534	137535	another servant	5513	" Well — he must be ruined , then . Go and turn her out , and send up Lafleur . "
137882	137885	137887	137889	the fashionable gentleman	2311	" Lafleur , "
137895	137907	137887	137889	the fashionable gentleman	2311	" you must dismiss that fellow John to - morrow morning . "
137908	137913	137887	137889	the fashionable gentleman	2311	" Yes , sir . "
137914	137941	137887	137889	the fashionable gentleman	2311	" He actually had the impertinence to bring me a message from a dun , while I was in a hurry to get dressed for dinner . "
137942	137954	137956	137957	the valet	5525	" Indeed , sir — you do n't say so sir ! "
137975	137996	137956	137957	the valet	5525	" Yes , sir — I will dismiss him to - morrow , sir — and without a character too . "
137997	138012	137956	137957	the valet	5525	" Do , Lafleur . And now to dress . Are the company come ? "
138013	138029	137956	137957	the valet	5525	" Mr. Chichester and Sir Rupert Harborough are in the drawing - room , sir . "
138030	138033	138035	138036	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Oh ! "
138044	138047	138041	138042	the gentleman	27107	name—"very well ! "
138155	138161	138163	138164	Mr. Greenwood	903	" My dear Sir Rupert , "
138166	138221	138163	138164	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I am delighted to see you . Chichester , how are you ? Where have you both been for the last six months ? Scarcely had I the pleasure of forming your acquaintance , when you were off like shots : and I have never seen nor heard of you till this morning . "
138222	138246	138248	138249	the baronet	26709	" Upon my honour , I hardly know what we have been doing — or indeed , what we have not been doing , "
138251	138269	138248	138249	the baronet	26709	" We have been in Paris and Brussels , and enjoyed all the pleasures of the Continent . "
138270	138292	138294	138294	Chichester	886	" And we found our way into the good graces of the Parisian ladies , and the purses of their husbands , "
138301	138306	138308	138309	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Ah ! ah ! "
138313	138328	138308	138309	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Trust you both for allowing yourselves to starve in a land of plenty . "
138329	138348	138350	138350	Chichester	886	" And so here we are , come back to England quite fresh and ready for new sport , "
138352	138405	138350	138350	Chichester	886	" You see that it is useful to go abroad for a season every now and then . Immediately after I passed through the Insolvents ' Court , two years ago , I went to Paris for six months , and came home again with a new reputation , as it were . "
138406	138414	138416	138417	Mr. Greenwood	903	" By the bye , Sir Rupert , "
138419	138438	138416	138417	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I lost a cool thousand to your father - in - law this afternoon at Tattersall 's . "
138439	138456	138458	138459	the baronet	26709	" What ! does the old lord do things in so spirited a way as that ? "
138461	138499	138458	138459	the baronet	26709	" Yes — now and then . I believe you and he are not on very good terms ? When I asked him after you a month or two ago , he appeared to evade the conversation . "
138500	138505	138507	138508	the baronet	26709	" The fact is , "
138510	138574	138507	138508	the baronet	26709	" old Lord and Lady Tremordyn pretend that I treat their daughter with neglect — just because I can not and will not be tied to my wife 's apron strings . I did not want to marry her ; but Lady Tremordyn intrigued to catch me ; and the old lord came down handsome — and so the match was made up . "
138642	138656	138658	138659	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Do you know what has become of your old flame Diana Arlington ? "
138668	138678	138680	138681	Sir Rupert	887	" And was she not your old flame too ? "
138685	138704	138680	138681	Sir Rupert	887	" I believe that when you were plain Mr. George Montague , instead of Mr. Montague Greenwood — — "
138705	138731	138658	138659	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Oh ! I have assumed the name of Greenwood , remember , because a relation of that name has left me a considerable fortune . "
138732	138754	138756	138757	the baronet	26709	" Well — that is a very good story to tell the world , but not friends , my dear fellow , "
138761	138784	138756	138757	the baronet	26709	" But we were talking of the Enchantress . I presume she is still under the protection of the Earl of Warrington ? "
138785	138790	138792	138792	Greenwood	903	" So I understand , "
138794	138801	138803	138804	the baronet	26709	" Well — I must say , "
138806	138840	138803	138804	the baronet	26709	" I always liked Diana ; and I dare say we should have been together up to the present moment , if it had not been for that infernal affair of Markham 's . "
138841	138847	138849	138850	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Ah ! Richard Markham ! "
138853	138865	138849	138850	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I have heard of him — but never seen him . "
138866	138879	138881	138881	Harborough	887	" I and Chichester were compelled to sacrifice him to save ourselves , "
138883	138897	138899	138899	Greenwood	903	" Yes — yes — it was a pity — a great pity , "
138906	138917	138919	138919	Chichester	886	" I wonder what has become of that same Markham ? "
138921	138950	138952	138952	Greenwood	903	" I understand that he lost the greater portion of his property by some unfortunate speculation or another , but the nature of which I have never learnt , "
138954	138971	138973	138975	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" And what about this Steam - Packet Company of which you were speaking this morning ? "
138977	139145	138973	138975	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" The fact is , I have got a certain Italian count in tow , and I intend to make him useful . He is an emigrant from the Grand Duchy of Castelcicala , having been concerned in some treasonable proceedings with Prince Alberto , who is the Grand Duke 's nephew , and who has also been compelled to fly to some other country . Be it as it may , this Count Alteroni and I became acquainted ; and , in the course of conversation , he observed that a fortune might be made by the establishment of a line of steam - packets between London and Montoni , the capital of Castelcicala . He added that he should be very willing to embark his own capital in such an enterprise . ' How extraordinary ! ' I immediately exclaimed : ' I had myself entertained the very same idea ! ' The count was enchanted ; and he has already advanced a considerable sum . "
139258	139272	139274	139276	Mr. Montague Greenwood	903	" I should very much like to have you both in the Direction , "
139285	139347	139279	139279	he	903	" but I have learnt that this Richard Markham , of whom we have been talking , is acquainted with the count ; and if he saw your names connected with the affair , he would instantly blow upon it . I should then have the count upon me for the fifteen thousand pounds he has already lodged in my hands . "
139348	139372	139374	139374	Chichester	886	" Let us write an anonymous letter to the count , and inform him that Markham has been convicted at the Old Bailey , "
139376	139381	139383	139383	Greenwood	903	" No — no , "
139386	139396	139383	139383	Greenwood	903	" you have injured that young man enough already . "
139397	139406	139408	139408	Chichester	886	" And what do you care about him ? "
139410	139422	139408	139408	Chichester	886	" You said just now that you had never seen him . "
139423	139433	139435	139435	Greenwood	903	" I did — and I repeat the assertion , "
139448	139511	139445	139445	he	903	" and I will beg you both to remember , gentlemen , that if you wish to co - operate with me in any of those speculations which I know so well how to manage , you will leave Mr. Richard Markham alone ; for I have certain private reasons for being rather anxious to do him a service than an injury . "
139512	139527	139529	139530	the baronet	26709	" Well , I will not in any way interfere with your good intentions , "
139532	139536	139538	139538	Chichester	886	" Nor I , "
139540	139556	139558	139559	Mr. Greenwood	903	" And as it is impossible for you to enter my Steam - Packet Company , "
139561	139705	139558	139559	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I will let you into another good thing which I have in view , and in which a certain banker is concerned . To tell you the real truth , this banker has been insolvent for some time ; and if his father had not advanced him about fifty thousand pounds three years ago , he would have gone to smash . As it was , the Lords of the Treasury got hold of his real position , by some means or another — he never could divine how ; and they refused a tender which he sent in for a certain money contract — I do n't know exactly what . Now his petition is more desperate than ever , and he and I are going to do an admirable stroke of business . I will let you both into it . "
139769	139787	139749	139750	a servant	5570	" This gentleman , sir , requests to be allowed to see you , if perfectly convenient . "
139788	139793	139795	139796	Mr. Greenwood	903	" The Count Alteroni ! "
139798	139846	139749	139750	a servant	5570	" What the devil could have brought him to London at this time of night ? John — show him into the study — there is a good fire for him ; and if that wo n't warm his heart , perhaps a bottle of Burgundy will . "
139872	139876	139858	139859	Mr. Greenwood	903	" the study . "
139877	139891	139893	139894	the count	26666	" My dear sir , I have to apologise for calling thus late , "
139896	139928	139893	139894	the count	26666	" but the truth is that I had a little business which brought me up to town to - day , and in this neighbourhood too ; and I thought — — "
139929	139939	139941	139942	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Pray offer no excuses , my dear count , "
139944	139968	139941	139942	Mr. Greenwood	903	" The truth is , I wished to see you very particularly — upon a matter not altogether connected with our enterprise — — "
139969	139972	139974	139975	the count	26666	" Indeed , "
139977	139986	139941	139942	Mr. Greenwood	903	" you interest me . Pray explain yourself . "
139987	140012	139941	139942	Mr. Greenwood	903	" In the first place , allow me to ask whether the ladies are yet acquainted with the undertaking in which you have embarked ? "
140013	140026	139941	139942	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Yes — I acquainted them with the fact this very morning . "
140027	140035	139941	139942	Mr. Greenwood	903	" And do they approve of it ? "
140036	140056	139941	139942	Mr. Greenwood	903	" They approve of every thing of which I think well , and disapprove of all that I abhor . "
140057	140073	140075	140075	Greenwood	903	" And do they know that I am the projector and principal in the enterprise ? "
140077	140085	140087	140088	the count	26666	" They are acquainted with every thing , "
140090	140164	140087	140088	the count	26666	" Indeed , they have formed of you the same exalted opinion which I myself entertain . It would be strange if they had not . We met you at the house of Lord Tremordyn ; and that nobleman spoke in the highest possible terms of you . But what connection exists between all those questions which you have put to me , and the matter concerning which you desired to see me ? "
140165	140187	139941	139942	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I am not sure that I ought to explain myself at present , nor to you in the first instance , "
140199	140245	139941	139942	Mr. Greenwood	903	" at all events I should wish you to know a little more of me , and to have some reason to thank me for the little service which I shall have the means of rendering you , in enabling you to treble your capital . "
140257	140326	140252	140253	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I had the pleasure of seeing the amiable countess and her lovely daughter many times last summer at the house of Lord Tremordyn ; and no one could know the Signora Isabella without being forcibly struck by her personal and mental qualifications . To render myself agreeable to Miss Isabella would be the height of my earthly happiness . You will pardon my presumption ; but — — "
140527	140533	140535	140535	he	5581	" I have no doubt , "
140542	140574	140535	140535	he	5581	" that Isabella will feel highly flattered by your good opinion of her . Indeed , I shall inform her without delay of the manner in which you have expressed yourself . "
140575	140580	140582	140582	Greenwood	903	" My dear sir , "
140585	140622	140535	140535	he	5581	" in the name of heaven tell the signora nothing at all about our present conversation . Her delicacy would be offended . Rather give me an opportunity of making myself better known to your daughter . "
140623	140673	140535	140535	he	5581	" I understand you . Come and pass a week or two with us at Richmond . We have not a soul staying with us at the present moment , Mr. Markham , who was our last guest , having returned to his own abode about ten days ago . "
140674	140683	140685	140686	Mr. Greenwood	903	" This is a busy time with me , "
140688	140706	140685	140686	Mr. Greenwood	903	" and I could scarcely spare a week with justice to yourself and my own interests — — "
140707	140710	140712	140713	the count	26666	" True , "
140715	140750	140751	140752	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I will bring the ladies up to town at the beginning of the new year . We have a very pressing invitation from the Tremordyns , and I will avail myself of it . "
140799	140802	140811	140811	he	5593	" There , "
140834	140882	140883	140883	he	5593	" I have not passed the last hour unprofitably . I have not only demanded the hand of the count 's lovely daughter , but have also persuaded the count to pay a few weeks ' visit to your father - in - law , Lord Tremordyn , "
140890	140902	140904	140905	the baronet	26709	" And what good do you propose by the latter arrangement ? "
140907	140979	140904	140905	the baronet	26709	" I shall get the count 's family at a house which Richard Markham stands no chance of visiting : for even if the count asked him to call upon him there , Markham would refuse , because he is sure to have read or heard that you , Sir Rupert , have married Lady Cecilia Huntingfield , and he would be afraid of meeting you at Lord Tremordyn 's residence . "
140980	141010	140904	140905	the baronet	26709	" And why should you be so anxious to separate the count from Markham , since Chichester and I are not to be in the Steam - packet concern ? "
141011	141039	141040	141041	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Because I myself could not , for certain reasons , visit the count 's family if I stood the chance of meeting that same Richard Markham . "
142549	142555	142566	142567	the butcher	5677	" Well , Mr. Pocock , "
142569	142578	142566	142567	the butcher	5677	" how does the world use you now ? "
142579	142588	142566	142567	the butcher	5677	" Very bad , indeed , Mr. Griskin , "
142593	142630	142566	142567	the butcher	5677	" For the last three year , come Janivary , I havn't known , when I got up in the morning , where the devil I should sleep at night;—and that is God Almighty 's truth . "
142631	142643	142645	142646	the butcher	5677	" I 'm sorry to hear your affairs do n't mend , "
142648	142668	142645	142646	the butcher	5677	" For my part , I 'm getting on blooming . I was a bankrupt only seven weeks ago . "
142669	142679	142681	142681	Markham	874	" A strange manner of being successful in business , "
142683	142694	142696	142697	the butcher	5677	" But all my goods was seized by the landlord , "
142706	142727	142696	142697	the butcher	5677	" and so they was saved from the messenger of the Court , when he come down to take possession . "
142728	142742	142744	142744	Pocock	1069	" Ah ! I suppose your bankruptcy has put you all right again , "
142746	142764	142744	142744	Pocock	1069	" Nothing like a bankruptcy now - a - days — it makes a man 's fortune . "
142765	142831	142696	142697	the butcher	5677	" Yes — and no going to quod neither . I made a lot of friends of mine creditors , and so I got my certificate the wery same day as I passed my second examination ; and now I 'm as right as a trivet . But what ails you , though , old feller , that you ca n't contrive to get on ? "
142832	142837	142839	142839	Pocock	1069	" The fact is , "
142849	142893	142839	142839	Pocock	1069	" I was led into bad company about three or four years ago , and I do n't care before who I say it , or who knows what infernal scrapes I was partly the means of getting a nice young fellow into . "
142894	142904	142906	142907	the butcher	5677	" I suppose you fell in with flash company ? "
142909	143098	142906	142907	the butcher	5677	" I did indeed ! I went out of my element — out of my proper sphere , as I may say ; and when a man does that without the means of keeping in it , he 's d —— d and done for at once . I fell in with a baronet and a swell cove of the name of Chichester , or Winchester , and who after all turned out to be the son of old Chichester the pawnbroker down the street here . They made a perfect tool of me . I was fed and pampered , and lived on the fat of the land ; and then , when the scheme fell through , I was trundled off like a hoop of which a charity schoolboy is tired . I fell into distress ; and though I 've met this here baronet and that there Chichester riding in their cabs , with tigers behind and horses before , they never so much as said , ' Talbot , ' or ' Pocock , my tulip , here is a quid for you . ' "
143099	143102	143104	143105	the butcher	5677	" Willanous , "
143107	143120	143104	143105	the butcher	5677	" But of what natur ' was the scheme you talk of ? "
143121	143256	142906	142907	the butcher	5677	" Why , I 'll tell you that too . I shall certainly proclaim my own crimes ; but I do n't hesitate to say that I was led away by those two thieves . My name , as you well know , is Bill Pocock , and they made me take the name of Talbot . I was brought up as an engraver , and did pretty well until some four years ago , when I lost my wife and got drinking , and then every thing went wrong . One day I fell in with this Chichester , and he lent me some money . He then began telling me how he knew the way of making an immense fortune with very little trouble , and no risk or expense to myself . "
143257	143264	143266	143267	the butcher	5677	" So far , so good , "
143269	143338	143266	143267	the butcher	5677	" I was hard up — I was rendered desperate by the death of my wife , and , to tell the truth , I wanted to live an idle life . I had got attached to public - house parlours , and could n't sit down to work with the graver . So I bit at Chichester 's proposal , and he introduced me to the baronet . "
143339	143345	143347	143348	the butcher	5677	" Another glass , Pocock , "
143395	143405	143407	143407	Talbot	894	" The scheme was certainly a very ingenious one , "
143409	143528	143407	143407	Talbot	894	" and deserved success . It was nothing more nor less than making bank - notes . I was used to engraving plates of that kind ; and so I undertook the job . I do n't care if any one here present goes and informs against me ; perhaps I should be better off in a prison than out of one . But what goes to my heart — and what I can never forget , and shall reproach myself for as long as I live , was the getting of a nice young fellow into a scrape , and making him stand Moses for the punishment , as you do , Griskin , for the grog . "
143529	143537	143539	143540	the butcher	5677	" And who was this young chap ? "
143542	143571	143539	143540	the butcher	5677	" One Markham . You must recollect his case . He was tried just about this time three years ago , and sentenced to two years ' imprisonment . "
143572	143579	143407	143407	Talbot	894	" Ca n't say I recollect . "
143580	143597	143599	143599	Pocock	945	" Well — this Markham was as innocent about the notes , as the child unborn ! "
143602	143615	143617	143618	the butcher	5677	" I raly do n't see that you need take on so , "
143620	143642	143617	143618	the butcher	5677	" for after all , you 'd better let another feller get into trouble than be locked up in lavender yourself . "
143643	143650	143652	143652	Pocock	945	" It was an unfortunate event , "
143659	143787	143652	143652	Pocock	945	" and nothing has prospered with me since . But what vexes me as much as all the rest , is to think of the conduct of those two chaps , Chichester and the baronet . They pretended not to know who I was , when I one day stopped them in Regent Street , and wanted to borrow a few pounds of them . The baronet turns round , and says to his pal , ' Who the devil is that fellow ? ' and Chichester puts up his eye - glass , stares at me through it for five minutes , and says , ' My good man , we never give alms to people unless they have certificates of good character to show . ' "
143798	143803	143789	143789	you	5688	" said the butcher . "
143823	143824	143825	143826	The devil	3259	" "
143869	143870	143847	143847	one	2053	" "
143876	143880	143847	143847	one	2053	" exclaimed Pocock , "
143929	143930	143933	143933	my	0	" "
143936	143971	143933	143933	my	0	" said the butcher , who was a good - natured man in his way , and who , having realised a considerable sum by his late bankruptcy , was disposed to be generous : "
143994	144004	143992	143992	Dick	1039	" he cried , addressing himself to the waiter , "
144044	144325	144036	144036	Dick	1039	" The waiter disappeared to execute these orders , and the conversation was then resumed upon the former topic . Pocock entered into all the details with which the reader is already acquainted ; and Markham who had made up his mind how to act , was determined to allow him to disclose spontaneously as much as he thought fit , before he should reveal himself . He sate in his obscure corner , shading his face with his hands , and affecting to be deeply interested in the columns of the Morning Advertiser , which lay the wrong way upwards before him . The moment Pocock had begun to speak upon matters which so deeply interested him , Richard had become an attentive listener , and , as that individual proceeded , and he found within his reach a means of establishing his innocence , his brain seemed to be excited with joy — even to delirium . His pulse throbbed violently — his heart palpitated audibly . Much as he had loathed that den when he first entered it , he would now have fallen down , and kissed its dirty , saw - dust covered floor . Hour after hour had passed away ; the clock had struck eleven , and still the Resurrection Man did not make his appearance . The butcher and Pocock were discussing their supper , and Markham was just thinking of accosting the latter , when the door was suddenly opened with great violence , and two persons muffled up in pea - coats , carrying enormous sticks , and smoking cigars , precipitated themselves into the parlour of the Dark House . "
144335	144349	144036	144036	Dick	1039	" ejaculated one , flinging himself upon a seat , and laughing heartily : "
144377	144378	144364	144365	the policeman	27346	" "
144395	144400	144388	144388	I	0	" observed the other ; "
144444	144445	144446	144446	I	0	" "
144464	144470	144446	144446	I	0	" said the first speaker . "
144511	144578	144493	144493	he	26985	" The latter portion of this conversation was uttered in whispers , and the two gentlemen again laughed heartily — doubtless because they had succeeded in the business which had that evening brought them to the eastern regions of London . In the midst of that second burst of hilarity , Mr. Pocock rose from his seat and advanced slowly towards the two new - comers . "
144583	144587	144493	144493	he	26985	" he exclaimed , "
144657	144679	144684	144684	you	27077	" The butcher burst out into a roar of laughter , which was echoed by several other inmates of the room . "
144686	144712	144684	144684	you	27077	" demanded Chichester , recovering his presence of mind sooner than the baronet ; for both were astounded at this unexpected and very embarrassing encounter . "
144723	144729	144717	144718	the man	2092	" murmured Sir Rupert Harborough . "
144736	144740	144741	144741	you	27077	" cried Pocock , "
144755	144769	144753	144753	Gentlemen	27077	" he added , turning towards the people seated at the various tables , "
144797	144798	144790	144790	they	27077	" "
144805	144814	144816	144816	you	27077	" said Chichester , in an impudent tone : "
144821	144822	144816	144816	you	27077	" "
144831	144832	144816	144816	you	27077	" "
144842	144847	144834	144834	I	0	" ejaculated the engraver . "
144894	144924	144927	144927	gentlemen	27077	" Chichester and the baronet were stupefied by this sudden and unexpected exposure . They knew not what to say or do ; and their countenances betrayed their guilt . "
144929	144936	144927	144927	gentlemen	27077	" resumed Pocock , growing excited , "
144965	144966	144967	144967	Devil	1074	" "
144972	144994	144967	144967	Devil	1074	" cried Chichester , now once more recovering his wonted self - possession , and determining to brave the accusation out : "
145017	145018	145019	145019	Liar	5727	" "
145021	145028	145019	145019	Liar	5727	" cried the engraver , furiously : "
145038	145039	145029	145029	I	0	" "
145045	145096	145043	145043	I	0	" calmly observed Markham , now advancing from his obscure corner , and appearing in the presence of those who so little expected to see him there . A tremendous sensation now prevailed in the room , and those who were spectators anxiously awaited the result of this strange drama . "
145117	145121	145157	145158	the Almighty	4958	" continued Markham . "
145169	145244	145157	145158	the Almighty	4958	" A solemn silence succeeded these words , which were delivered in a tone which produced an impression of awe upon all who heard them . Even the depraved and hardened men that were present on this occasion , in the parlour of the Dark House , gazed with respect upon the young man who dared to speak of the Almighty in that den of dissipation . Markham continued after a short pause : — "
145375	145376	145403	145403	my	0	" "
145380	145401	145403	145403	my	0	" said Mr. Chichester , perceiving that he was in no danger , and therefore assuming an air of bravado . "
145413	145418	145406	145406	I	0	" muttered the baronet . "
145438	145439	145406	145406	I	0	" "
145446	145450	145406	145406	I	0	" cried Markham ; "
145463	145464	145453	145453	I	0	" "
145475	145498	145465	145465	They	5741	" said the butcher , very coolly taking off his apron , and turning up the sleeves of his blue stuff jacket . "
145509	145510	145511	145511	I	0	" "
145514	145545	145511	145511	I	0	" cried a barber 's boy , laying aside his pipe , taking a long pull at the porter , and then advancing towards the two adventurers with clenched fists . "
145554	145558	145550	145550	I	0	" ejaculated Markham . "
145575	145576	145571	145571	I	0	" "
145599	145652	145584	145585	John Bull	895	" cried the butcher ; and before Richard could interfere farther , he felled the baronet with one blow of his tremendous fist . The barber forthwith pitched into the fashionable Mr. Chichester , who struggled in vain to defend himself . The baronet rose ; and the butcher instantly took his head "
145656	145769	145584	145585	John Bull	895	" and pummelled him to his heart 's content . As soon as Chichester and Sir Rupert were so severely thrashed that they were covered all over with bruises , and could scarcely stand upon their legs , the butcher and the barber kicked them into the open air , amidst the shouts and acclamations of all the inmates of the Dark House parlour . When order was once more restored , Markham addressed himself to the two champions who had avenged him in their own peculiar style , and not only thanked them for their well - meant though mistaken kindness , but also gave them munificent proofs of his bounty . "
145773	145781	145584	145585	John Bull	895	" said Richard , turning towards Pocock , "
145793	145794	145783	145783	you	5743	" "
145807	145812	145783	145783	you	5743	" answered the engraver . "
145844	145845	145848	145848	I	0	" "
145863	145905	145858	145861	a man of honour	26739	" Markham proceeded to draw up the declaration referred to ; and Pocock signed it with a firm and steady hand . This ceremony being completed , Richard placed Bank of England notes for fifty pounds in the engraver 's hand . "
145909	145913	145858	145861	a man of honour	26739	" he said , "
145969	146082	146083	146083	I	0	" Pocock wept tears of gratitude and repentance — the only acknowledgment he could offer for this sudden and most welcome aid . His emotions choked his powers of utterance . Markham hurried from the room , and took his departure from the establishment which possessed such an ominous name , but which had proved the scene of a great benefit to him that evening . He was hurrying up Brick Lane in a northerly direction — that is to say , towards Church Street , when he was suddenly stopped by an individual whom he encountered in his way , and who carried a large life - preserver in his hand . "
146093	146104	146085	146085	you	0	" said the Resurrection Man — for it was he . "
146116	146120	146105	146105	I	0	" answered Richard . "
146149	146150	146146	146146	you	0	" "
146171	146172	146146	146146	you	0	" "

146304	146305	146294	146294	I	0	" "
146319	146326	146314	146314	you	0	" demanded the Resurrection Man gruffly . "
146343	146344	146345	146345	I	0	" "
146382	146386	146371	146371	I	0	" added Markham , "
146391	146392	146371	146371	I	0	" "
146396	146416	146371	146371	I	0	" cried the Resurrection Man , who grew uneasy at the cold and indifferent way in which Markham spoke . "
146443	146444	146430	146430	You	0	" "
146455	146460	146449	146449	you	0	" ejaculated Richard firmly ; "
146500	146501	146470	146470	I	0	" "
146510	146516	146470	146470	I	0	" cried the Resurrection Man . "
146587	146588	146568	146568	I	0	" "
146597	146601	146589	146589	You	0	" said Markham ; "
146625	146626	146622	146622	you	0	" "
146630	146641	146622	146622	you	0	" ejaculated the Resurrection Man , considerably crest - fallen ; "
146656	146657	146622	146622	you	0	" "
146660	146668	146670	146670	you	0	" returned Richard in a resolute manner ; "
146732	146733	146734	146734	You	0	" "
146746	146752	146743	146743	I	0	" cried the Resurrection Man . "
146816	146841	146842	146842	You	0	" With these words Markham continued his way up Brick Lane ; but the Resurrection Man was again by his side in a moment . "
146848	146858	146859	146859	I	0	" he muttered in a hoarse and savage tone . "
146867	146868	146869	146869	You	0	" "
146875	146886	146869	146869	You	0	" repeated the villain , grinding his teeth with rage : "
146918	146919	146920	146920	I	0	" "
146930	147897	146920	146920	I	0	" said Markham . He then walked rapidly on , without looking behind him . The Resurrection Man stood still for a moment , considering how to act : then , apparently struck by a sudden idea , he hastened stealthily after Richard Markham . THE district of Spitalfields and Bethnal Green was totally unknown to Markham . Indeed , his visit upon the present occasion was the first he had ever paid to that densely populated and miserable region . It was now midnight ; and the streets were nearly deserted . The lamps , few and far between , only made darkness visible , instead of throwing a useful light upon the intricate maze of narrow thoroughfares . Markham 's object was to reach Shoreditch as soon as possible ; for he knew that opposite the church there was a cab - stand where he might procure a vehicle to take him home . Emerging from Brick Lane , he crossed Church Street , and struck into that labyrinth of dirty and dangerous lanes in the vicinity of Bird - cage Walk , which we alluded to at the commencement of the preceding chapter . He soon perceived that he had mistaken his way ; and at length found himself floundering about in a long narrow street , unpaved , and here and there almost blocked up with heaps of putrescent filth . There was not a lamp in this perilous thoroughfare : no moon on high irradiated his path;—black night enveloped every thing above and below in total darkness . Once or twice he thought he heard footsteps behind him ; and then he stopped , hoping to be overtaken by some one of whom he might inquire his way . But either his ears deceived him , or else the person whose steps he heard stopped when he did . There was not a light in any of the houses on either side ; and not a sound of revelry or sorrow escaped from the ill - closed casements . Richard was bewildered ; and — to speak truly — he began to be alarmed . He remembered to have read of the mysterious disappearance of persons in the east end of the metropolis , and also of certain fell deeds of crime which had been lately brought to light in the very district where he was now wandering;—and he could not help wishing that he was in some more secure and less gloomy region . He was groping his way along , feeling with his hands against the houses to guide him,—now knee - deep in some filthy puddle , now stumbling over some heap of slimy dirt , now floundering up to his ankles in the mud,—when a heavy and crushing blow fell upon his hat from behind . He staggered and fell against the door of a house . Almost at the same instant that door was thrust open , and two powerful arms hurled the prostrate young man down three or four steps into a passage . The person who thus ferociously attacked him leapt after him , closing the door violently behind him . All this occupied but a couple of seconds ; and though Markham was not completely stunned by the blow , he was too much stupefied by the suddenness and violence of the assault to cry out . To this circumstance he was probably indebted for his life ; for the villain who had struck him no doubt conceived the blow to have been fatal ; and therefore , instead of renewing the attack , he strode over Markham and entered a room into which the passage opened . Richard 's first idea was to rise and attempt an escape by the front door ; but before he had time to consider it even for a moment , the murderous ruffian struck a light in the room , which , as well as a part of the passage , was immediately illuminated by a powerful glare . Markham had been thrown upon the damp tiles with which the passage was paved , in such a manner that his head was close by the door of the room . The man who had assailed him lighted a piece of candle in a bright tin shade hanging against the wall ; and the reflection produced by the metal caused the strong glare that fell so suddenly upon Richard 's eyes . Markham was about to start from his prostrate position when the interior of that room was thus abruptly revealed to him ; but for a few moments the spectacle which met his sight paralyzed every limb , and rendered him breathless , speechless , and motionless with horror . Stretched upon a shutter , which three chairs supported , was a corpse — naked , and of that blueish or livid colour which denotes the beginning of decomposition ! Near this loathsome object was a large tub full of water ; and to that part of the ceiling immediately above it were affixed two large hooks , to each of which hung thick cords . In one corner of the room were long flexible iron rods , spades , pickaxes , wooden levers , coils of thick rope , trowels , saws , hammers , huge chisels , skeleton - keys , & c. But how great was Richard 's astonishment when , glancing from the objects just described towards the villain who had hurled him into that den of horrors , his eyes were struck by the sombre and revolting countenance of the Resurrection Man . He closed his eyes for a moment , as if he could thus banish both thought and danger . "
147904	147910	147902	147902	Mummy	1075	" ejaculated the Resurrection Man ; "
147926	147948	147917	147917	I	0	" Scarcely had he uttered these words , when a low knock was heard at the front door of the house . "
147955	147963	147917	147917	I	0	" cried the Resurrection Man , aloud ; "
147975	148031	147966	147967	these fellows	5760	" These words struck fresh dismay into the soul of Richard Markham ; for it instantly occurred to him that any friends of the Resurrection Man , who were thus craving admittance , were more likely to aid than to frustrate that villain 's designs upon the life and property of a fellow - creature . "
148036	148068	148071	148071	Mummy	1075	" cried the Resurrection Man , once more ; and , hastily returning into the passage , he reiterated his summons at the bottom of a staircase at the further end ; "
148082	148083	148084	148084	I	0	" "
148096	148178	148090	148090	I	0	" answered a cracked female voice from the top of the staircase ; and in another moment an old , blear - eyed , shrivelled hag made her appearance . She was so thin , her eyes were so sunken , her skin was so much like dirty parchment , and her entire appearance was so horrible and repulsive , that it was impossible to conceive a more appropriate and expressive nickname than the one which had been conferred upon her . "
148184	148194	148182	148182	Mummy	1075	" said the ruffian , in a hasty whisper ; "
148223	148365	148213	148214	the chaps	3290	" Another knock was heard at the door . Markham , well aware that resistance was at present vain , exercised sufficient control over himself to remain motionless , with his eyes nearly closed , while the Resurrection Man and the Mummy dragged him hastily into the back room . The Mummy turned the key in the lock , while the Resurrection Man hurried to the street door , and admitted two men into the front apartment . One was Tom the Cracksman ; the other was a rogue of the same stamp , and was known amongst his confederates in crime by the name of the Buffer . It was this man 's boast that he never robbed any one without stripping him to the very skin ; and as a person in a state of nudity is said to be "
148369	148379	148213	148214	the chaps	3290	" the origin of his pseudonym is easily comprehended . "
148382	148389	148390	148390	you	5767	" said the Cracksman , sulkily , "
148421	148422	148418	148418	my	0	" "
148432	148438	148425	148427	the old Mummy	5769	" returned the Resurrection Man ; "
148461	148462	148450	148450	I	0	" "
148473	148478	148466	148466	we	5771	" said the Cracksman , "
148492	148493	148466	148466	we	5771	" "
148499	148505	148466	148466	we	5771	" cried the Resurrection Man . "
148520	148521	148507	148507	you	5767	" "
148581	148582	148625	148625	he	0	" "
148589	148595	148625	148625	he	0	" ejaculated the Resurrection Man . "
148611	148616	148625	148625	he	0	" returned the Cracksman . "
148628	148633	148625	148625	he	0	" added the Buffer . "
148674	148675	148669	148669	you	5767	" "
148722	148723	148726	148726	my	0	" "
148731	148736	148726	148726	my	0	" exclaimed the Buffer . "
148795	148796	148780	148793	a feller that was walking so comfortable along , looking up at the moon	5780	" "
148814	148819	148799	148799	I	0	" added the Cracksman , "
148865	148866	148861	148861	their	5782	" "
148875	148880	148861	148861	their	5782	" said the Buffer ; "
148951	148952	148943	148943	they	3290	" "
148968	148991	148962	148962	I	0	" said the Cracksman , turning to the Resurrection Man , who had remained silent during the colloquy between his two companions ; "
149000	149001	149002	149002	I	0	" "
149006	149011	149002	149002	I	0	" was the answer , "
149029	149030	149031	149031	He	5788	" "
149034	149039	149031	149031	He	5788	" said the Cracksman ; "
149051	149052	149068	149069	a customer	5790	" "
149057	149063	149064	149064	he	5788	" exclaimed the Resurrection Man ; "
149080	149789	149073	149073	We	5771	" The Resurrection Man did not for a moment doubt that Richard Markham had been killed by the blow which he had inflicted upon him with his life - preserver ; and he therefore did not hesitate to undertake the business just proposed by his two confederates . He knew that , whatever Richard 's pockets might contain , he could rely upon the honesty of the Mummy , who — horrible to relate — was the miscreant 's own mother . Having therefore given a few instructions , in a whisper , to the old woman , he prepared to accompany the Cracksman and the Buffer . The three worthies provided themselves with some of the long flexible rods and other implements before noticed ; and the Resurrection Man took from a cupboard two boxes , each of about six inches square , and which he gave to his companions to carry . He also concealed the tin shade which held the candle , about his person ; and , these preliminaries being settled , the three men left the house . Let us now return to Richard Markham . The moment he was deposited in the back room , and the door had closed behind the occupants of that fearful den , he started up , a prey to the most indescribable feelings of alarm and horror . What a lurking hole of enormity — what a haunt of infamy — what a scene of desperate crime — was this in which he now found himself ! A feculent smell of the decomposing corpse in the next room reached his nostrils , and produced a nauseating sensation in his stomach . And that corpse — was it the remains of one who had died a natural death , or who had been most foully murdered ? He dared not answer the question which he had thus put to himself ; he feared lest the solution of that mystery might prove ominous in respect to his own fate . Oh ! for the means of escape ! He must fly — he must fly from that horrible sink of crime — from that human slaughter - house ! But how ? the door was locked — and the window was closed with a shutter . If he made the slightest noise , the ruffians in the next room would rush in and assassinate him ! But , hark ! those men were talking , and he could overhear all they said . Could it be possible ? The two who had just come , were going to take the third away with them upon his own revolting business ! Hope returned to the bosom of the poor young man : he felt that he might yet be saved ! But — oh , horror ! on what topic had the conversation turned ? Those men were rejoicing in their own infernal inventions to render murder unsuspected . The object of the tub of water , and the hooks and cords upon the ceiling , were now explained . The unsuspecting individual who passed the door of that accursed dwelling by night was set upon by the murderers , dragged into the house , gagged , and suspended by his feet to these hooks , while his head hung downwards in the water . And thus he delivered up his last breath ; and the wretches kept him there until decomposition commenced , that the corpse might not appear too fresh to the surgeon to whom it was to be sold ! Merciful heavens ! could such things be ? could atrocities of so appalling a nature be perpetrated in a great city , protected by thousands of a well - paid police ? Could the voice of murder — murder effected with so much safety , cry up to heaven for vengeance through the atmosphere of London ? At length the three men went out , as before described ; and Markham felt an immense weight suddenly lifted from off his mind . Before the Resurrection Man set out upon his excursion with the Cracksman and the Buffer , he had whispered these words to the Mummy : "
149902	150157	150158	150159	Vile wretch	5795	" It was in obedience to these instructions that the Mummy took a candle in her hand , and proceeded to the back - room , as soon as her son and his two companions had left the house . The horrible old woman was not afraid of the dead : her husband had been a resurrection man , and her only son followed the same business,—she was therefore too familiar with the sight of death in all its most fearful as well as its most interesting shapes to be alarmed at it . The revolting spectacle of a corpse putrid with decomposition produced no more impression upon her than the pale and beautiful remains of any lovely girl whom death had called early to the tomb , and whose form was snatched from its silent couch beneath the sod ere the finger of decay had begun its ravages . That hideous old woman considered corpses an article of commerce , and handled her wares as a trader does his merchandize . She cared no more for the sickly and fetid odour which they sent forth , than the tanner does for the smell of the tan - yard , or the scourer for the fumes of his bleaching - liquid . The Mummy entered the back - room , holding a candle in her hand . Markham started forward , and caught her by the wrist . She uttered a sort of growl of savage disappointment , but gave no sign of alarm . "
150161	150165	150158	150159	Vile wretch	5795	" exclaimed Richard ; "
150179	150180	150166	150166	God	880	" "
150192	150198	150200	150200	I	0	" said the old woman ; "
150210	150211	150213	150213	me	0	" "
150215	150219	150213	150213	me	0	" cried Markham : "
150228	150229	150213	150213	me	0	" "
150235	150240	150213	150213	me	0	" replied the hag . "
150269	150270	150274	150274	I	0	" "
150279	150377	150274	150274	I	0	" The old woman turned and walked slowly out of the room . Markham went after her ; for he thought that if he could discover who the unfortunate person was that had met his death in that accursed dwelling , he might be enabled to relieve his family at least from the horrors of suspense , although he should be the bearer of fatal news indeed . The Mummy opened the door of a cupboard formed beneath the staircase , and holding forward the light , pointed to some clothes which hung upon a nail inside . "
150388	150394	150395	150395	I	0	" said the old woman ; "
150401	150821	150395	150395	I	0	" With these words she drew back , but still held the candle in such a way as to throw the light into the closet . Markham stepped forward to reach the clothes , and , in extending his hand to take them from the peg , he advanced one of his feet upon the floor of the closet . A trap - door instantly gave way beneath his foot : he lost his balance , and fell precipitately into a subterranean excavation . The trap - door , which moved with a spring , closed by itself above his head , and he heard the triumphant cackling laugh of the old hag , as she fastened it with a large iron bolt . The Mummy then went and seated herself by the corpse in the front room ; and , while she rocked backwards and forwards in her chair , she crooned the following song : — THE BODY - SNATCHER 'S SONG . We must leave the Mummy singing her horrible staves , and accompany the body - snatchers in their proceedings at Shoreditch Church . THE Resurrection Man , the Cracksman , and the Buffer hastened rapidly along the narrow lanes and filthy alleys leading towards Shoreditch Church . They threaded their way in silence , through the jet - black darkness of the night , and without once hesitating as to the particular turnings which they were to follow . Those men were as familiar with that neighbourhood as a person can be with the rooms and passages in his own house . At length the body - snatchers reached the low wall surmounted with a high railing which encloses Shoreditch churchyard . They were now at the back part of that burial ground , in a narrow and deserted street , whose dark and lonely appearance tended to aid their designs upon an edifice situated in one of the most populous districts in all London . For some minutes before their arrival an individual , enveloped in a long cloak , was walking up and down beneath the shadow of the wall . This was the surgeon , whose thirst after science had called into action the energies of the body - snatchers that night . The Cracksman advanced first , and ascertained that the surgeon had already arrived , and that the coast was otherwise clear . He then whistled in a low and peculiar manner ; and his two confederates came up . "
150829	150838	150826	150826	your	5799	" said the surgeon in a hasty whisper . "
150845	150851	150826	150826	your	5799	" answered the Resurrection Man . "
150862	150869	150870	150870	You	5799	" added the surgeon , interrogatively . "
150887	150893	150879	150879	we	5800	" said the Resurrection Man . "
150897	150902	150904	150904	my	0	" whispered the surgeon ; "
150937	150976	150978	150978	you	5799	" The surgeon and the body - snatchers then scaled the railing , and in a few moments stood in the churchyard . The Resurrection Man addressed himself to his two confederates and the surgeon , and said , "
150998	151079	151092	151094	the Resurrection Man	3220	" With these words he crept stealthily along , amidst the tomb - stones , towards the church . The surgeon and the Cracksman seated themselves upon a grave close to the wall ; and the Buffer threw himself flat upon his stomach , with his ear towards the ground . He remained in this position for some minutes , and then uttered a species of low growl as if he were answering some signal which caught his ears alone . "
151097	151156	151092	151094	the Resurrection Man	3220	" whispered the Buffer , raising his head towards the surgeon and the Cracksman . He then laid his ear close to the ground once more , and resumed his listening posture . In a few minutes he again replied to a signal ; and this time his answer was conveyed by means of a short sharp whistle . "
151182	151301	151092	151094	the Resurrection Man	3220	" observed the Buffer in a whisper . Nearly twenty minutes elapsed after this announcement . The surgeon 's teeth chattered with the intense cold ; and he could not altogether subdue certain feelings of horror at the idea of the business which had brought him thither . The almost mute correspondence which those two men were enabled to carry on together — the methodical precision with which they performed their avocations — and the coolness they exhibited in undertaking a sacrilegious task , made a powerful impression upon his mind . He shuddered from head to foot:—his feelings of aversion were the same as he would have experienced had a loathsome reptile crawled over his naked flesh . "
151308	151319	151092	151094	the Resurrection Man	3220	" suddenly exclaimed the Buffer , rising from the ground . "
151323	151458	151092	151094	the Resurrection Man	3220	" The surgeon and the Cracksman followed the Buffer to the southern side of the church where there was a flight of steps leading up to a side - door in a species of lobby , or lodge . This door was open ; and the Resurrection Man was standing inside the lodge . As soon as they had all entered the sacred edifice , the door was carefully closed once more . We have before said that the night was cold : but the interior of the church was of a chill so intense , that an icy feeling appeared to penetrate to the very back - bone . The wind murmured down the aisle ; and every footstep echoed , like a hollow sound in the distance , throughout the spacious pile . "
151463	151472	151476	151476	you	26649	" said the Resurrection Man to the surgeon , "
151486	151513	151476	151476	you	26649	" The surgeon groped his way towards the communion - table , and at the northern side of the railings which surrounded it he stopped short . "
151520	151524	151535	151535	You	26649	" he said , "
151560	151589	151535	151535	You	26649	" The Resurrection Man stooped down , felt with his hand for the joints of the pavement in that particular spot , and thrust his knife between them . "
151592	151603	151535	151535	You	26649	" he said , after a few minutes ' silence : "
151632	151633	151618	151618	you	26649	" "
151686	151687	151688	151688	We	5810	" "
151698	151704	151688	151688	We	5810	" said the Resurrection Man ; "
151717	151718	151688	151688	We	5810	" "
151725	151735	151688	151688	We	5810	" returned the surgeon , in a decided tone . "
151806	151807	151784	151784	You	26649	" "
151814	151820	151821	151821	You	26649	" said the Resurrection Man . "
151837	152317	151831	151832	my mates	5822	" In a moment the Resurrection Man lighted a piece of candle , and placed it in the tin shade before alluded to . The glare which it shed was thereby thrown almost entirely downwards . He then carefully , and with surprising rapidity , examined the joints of the large flag - stone which was to be removed , and on which no inscription had yet been engraved . He observed the manner in which the mortar was laid down , and noticed even the places where it spread a little over the adjoining stones : or where it was slightly deficient . This inspection being completed , he extinguished the light , and set to work in company with the Cracksman and the Buffer . The eyes of the surgeon gradually became accustomed to the obscurity ; and he was enabled to observe to some extent the proceedings of the body - snatchers . These men commenced by pouring vinegar over the mortar round the stone which they were to raise . They then took long clasp - knives , with very thin and flexible blades , from their pockets ; and inserted them between the joints of the stones . They moved these knives rapidly backwards and forwards for a few seconds , so as effectually to loosen the mortar , and moistened the interstices several times with the vinegar . This operation being finished , they introduced the thin and pointed end of a lever between the end of the stone which they were to raise and the one adjoining it . The Resurrection Man , who held the lever , only worked it very gently ; but at every fresh effort on his part , the Cracksman and the Buffer introduced each a wedge of wood into the space which thus grew larger and larger . By these means , had the lever suddenly given way , the stone would not have fallen back into its setting . At length it was raised to a sufficient height to admit of its being supported by a thick log about three feet in length . While these three men were thus proceeding as expeditiously as possible with their task , the surgeon , although a man of a naturally strong mind , could not control the strange feelings which crept upon him . It suddenly appeared to him as if he beheld those men for the first time . That continuation of regular and systematic movements — that silent perseverance , faintly shadowed forth amidst the obscurity of the night , at length assumed so singular a character , that the surgeon felt as if he beheld three demons disinterring a doomed one to carry him off to hell ! He was aroused from this painful reverie by the Resurrection Man , who said to him , "
152326	152358	151831	151832	my mates	5822	" The surgeon applied all his strength to this task ; and the huge flag - stone was speedily moved upon two wooden rollers away from the mouth of the grave . "
152368	152374	152359	152359	You	5824	" said the Resurrection Man . "
152408	152413	152378	152406	one can be who stood by the grave for a quarter of an hour in day - light , and who has to recognise it again in total darkness	5826	" answered the surgeon . "
152422	152423	152359	152359	You	5824	" "
152433	152439	152359	152359	You	5824	" interrupted the Resurrection Man ; "
152462	152463	152378	152406	one can be who stood by the grave for a quarter of an hour in day - light , and who has to recognise it again in total darkness	5826	" "
152475	152480	152481	152481	I	0	" replied the surgeon . "
152498	152549	152481	152481	I	0	" The Resurrection Man took one of the long flexible rods which we have before noticed , and thrust it down into the vault . The point penetrated into the lid of a coffin . He drew it back , put the point to his tongue , and tasted it . "
152552	152560	152481	152481	I	0	" he said , smacking his lips , "
152578	152579	152580	152580	I	0	" "
152588	152678	152580	152580	I	0	" observed the surgeon . The body - snatchers then proceeded to raise the coffin , by means of ropes passed underneath it . This was a comparatively easy portion of their task ; and in a few moments it was placed upon the flag - stones of the church . The Resurrection Man took a chisel and opened the lid with considerable care . He then lighted his candle a second time ; and the glare fell upon the pale features of the corpse in its narrow shell . "
152685	153040	152580	152580	I	0	" said the surgeon , casting a hasty glance upon the face of the dead body , which was that of a young girl of about sixteen . The Resurrection Man extinguished the light ; and he and his companions proceeded to lift the corpse out of the coffin . The polished marble limbs of the deceased were rudely grasped by the sacrilegious hands of the body - snatchers ; and , having stripped the corpse stark naked , they tied its neck and heels together by means of a strong cord . They then thrust it into a large sack made for the purpose . The body - snatchers then applied themselves to the restoration of the vault to its original appearance . The lid of the coffin was carefully fastened down ; and that now tenantless bed was lowered into the tomb . The stone was rolled over the mouth of the vault ; and one of the small square boxes previously alluded to , furnished mortar wherewith to fill up the joints . The Resurrection Man lighted his candle a third time , and applied the cement in such a way that even the very workman who laid the stone down after the funeral would not have known that it had been disturbed . Then , as this mortar was a shade fresher and lighter than that originally used , the Resurrection Man scattered over it a thin brown powder , which was furnished by the second box brought away from his house on this occasion . Lastly , a light brush was swept over the scene of these operations , and the necessary precautions were complete . The clock struck three as the surgeon and the body - snatchers issued from the church , carrying the sack containing the corpse between them . They reached the wall at the back of the churchyard , and there deposited their burden , while the Cracksman hastened to see if the surgeon 's carriage had arrived . In a few minutes he returned to the railing , and said in a low tone , "
153044	153194	152580	152580	I	0	" The body was lifted over the iron barrier and conveyed to the vehicle . The surgeon counted ten sovereigns into the hands of each of the body - snatchers ; and , having taken his seat inside the vehicle , close by his strange freight , was whirled rapidly away towards his own abode . The three body - snatchers retraced their steps to the house in the vicinity of the Bird - cage Walk ; and the Cracksman and Buffer , having deposited the implements of their avocation in the corner of the front room , took their departure . The moment the Resurrection Man was thus relieved from the observation of his companions , he seized the candle and hastened into the back room , where he expected to find the corpse of Richard Markham stripped and washed . To his surprise the room was empty . "
153206	153223	153199	153201	the old fool	5831	" he exclaimed : then , hastening to the foot of the stairs , he cried , "
153230	153259	153224	153224	Mummy	1075	" In a few moments a door on the first floor opened , and the old woman appeared in her night gear at the head of the stairs . "
153266	153270	153262	153262	you	5832	" she exclaimed . "
153294	153295	153286	153286	you	5832	" "
153305	153306	153307	153307	Gammon	1079	" "
153325	153331	153332	153332	I	0	" demanded the Resurrection Man . "
153342	153348	153336	153336	he	5831	" returned the old hag : "
153370	153371	153351	153351	he	5831	" "
153390	153400	153377	153377	I	0	" ejaculated the Resurrection Man , stamping his foot . "
153421	153422	153426	153426	yourself	5832	" "
153430	153442	153428	153428	Tony	1061	" said the old hag , with a horrible cackling laugh ; "
153453	153454	153448	153448	I	0	" "
153461	153462	153426	153426	yourself	5832	" "
153472	153477	153426	153426	yourself	5832	" answered the Mummy . "
153485	153498	153426	153426	yourself	5832	" exclaimed the Resurrection Man , in a state of horrible suspense . "
153508	153509	153426	153426	yourself	5832	" "
153516	153527	153528	153528	you	5832	" cried the Resurrection Man in a voice of thunder : "
153543	153544	153528	153528	you	5832	" "
153547	153559	153528	153528	you	5832	" exclaimed the Mummy , in a tone of profound alarm . "
153564	153570	153528	153528	you	5832	" repeated the Resurrection Man . "
153602	153603	153606	153606	you	5832	" "
153619	153631	153632	153632	You	5832	" cried the old hag , now furious in her turn . "
153650	153651	153648	153648	you	5832	" "
153659	153669	153657	153657	mother	3159	" said the Resurrection Man , grinding his teeth . "
153698	153699	153686	153686	I	0	" "
153704	153709	153686	153686	I	0	" exclaimed the Mummy . "
153771	153772	153778	153778	you	0	" "
153787	153794	153778	153778	you	0	" persisted the old harridan doggedly . "
153799	153804	153778	153778	you	0	" cried the man . "
153819	154184	153808	153810	this cursed Markham	5846	" The Resurrection Man still had a hope left : the subterranean pit beneath the stairs was deep , and Markham might have been stunned by the fall . He hastened to the trap - door , and raised it . The vivid light of his candle was thrown to the very bottom of the pit by means of the bright reflector of tin . The hole was empty . Maddened by disappointment — a prey to the most terrible apprehensions — and uncertain whether to flee or remain in his den , the Resurrection Man paced the passage in a state of mind which would not have been envied by even a criminal on his way to execution . WHEN Richard Markham was precipitated into the hole beneath the stairs , by the perfidy of the Mummy , he fell with his head against a stone , and became insensible . He lay in this manner for upwards of half an hour , when a current of air which blew steadily upon his face , revived him ; and he awoke to all the horrors of his situation . He had seen and passed through enough that night to unhinge the strongest mind . The secrets of the accursed den in a subterranean dungeon of which he now lay,—the atrocious mysteries revealed by the conversation of the body - snatchers ere they set out on their expedition to Shoreditch Church,—the cold corpse of some unfortunate being most inhumanly murdered , and all the paraphernalia of a hideous death , in the front - room of that outpost of hell,—haunted his imagination , and worked him up to a pitch of excitement bordering upon frenzy . He felt that if he did not escape from that hole , he should dash his head against the wall , or go raving mad . He clenched his fists and struck them against his forehead in an access of despair . And then he endeavoured to reason with himself , and to look the perils that beset him , in the face . But he could not remain cool — he could not control his agonising emotions . "
154188	154193	153808	153810	this cursed Markham	5846	" he exclaimed aloud ; "
154351	154433	154345	154346	O Lord	29128	" Such was the fervent , heart - felt prayer which Markham breathed to heaven , in the agony and despair of his soul . He extended his arms , with his hands clasped together , in the ardour of his appeal ; and they encountered an opening in the wall . A ray of hope penetrated to his heart ; and when upon further search , he discovered an aperture sufficiently wide for him to creep through , he exclaimed , "
154464	155119	155121	155121	you	5854	" At all risks he determined to pass through the opening — lead whithersoever it might ; for he knew that he could scarcely be worse off ; and he felt a secret influence which prompted him thus to act , and for which he could not wholly account . He crept through the hole in the partition - wall , and found himself upon a soft damp ground . Every thing was veiled in the blackest obscurity . He groped about with his hands , and stepped cautiously forward , pausing at every pace . Presently his foot encountered what appeared to be a step : to his infinite joy he ascertained , in another moment , that he was at the bottom of a flight of stone stairs . He ascended them , and came to a door , which yielded to his touch . He proceeded slowly and cautiously along a passage , groping his way with his hands ; and , in a few moments he reached another door , which opened with a latch . He was now in the open street ! Carefully closing the door behind him , he hurried away from that accursed vicinity as if he were pursued by blood - hounds . He ran — he ran , reckless of the deep pools of stagnant water , careless of the heaps of thick mud through which he passed,—indifferent to the bruises which he sustained against the angles of houses , the corners of streets , and the stone - steps of doors,—unmindful of the dangers which he dared in threading thus wildly those rugged and uneven thoroughfares amidst the dense obscurity which covered the earth . He ran — he ran , a delirium of joy thrilling in his brain , and thanksgiving in his soul ; for now that he had escaped from the peril which so lately beset him , it appeared to his imagination a thousand times more frightful than when it actually impended over him . Oh ! he was happy — happy — thrice happy , in the enjoyment of liberty , and the security of life once more;—and he began to look upon the scenes of that eventful night as an accumulation of horrors which could have possibility only in a dream ! He ran — he ran , amidst those filthy lanes and foul streets , where a nauseating atmosphere prevailed;—but had he been threading a labyrinth of rose - trees , amongst the most delicious perfumes , he could not have experienced a more burning — ardent — furious joy ! Yes — his delight was madness , frenzy ! On , on — splashed with mud — floundering through black puddles — knee - deep in mire,—on , on he went — reckless which direction he pursued , so long as the rapidity of his pace removed him afar from the accursed house that had nearly become his tomb ! For an hour did he thus pursue his way . At length he stopped through sheer exhaustion , and seated himself upon the steps of a door over which a lamp was flickering . He collected his scattered ideas as well as he could , and began to wonder whither his wild and reckless course had led him : but no conjecture on his part furnished him with any clue to solve the mystery of his present whereabouts . He knew that he must be somewhere in the eastern district of the metropolis ; but in what precise spot it was impossible for him to tell . While he was thus lost in vain endeavours to unravel the tangled topographical skein which perplexed his imagination , he heard footsteps advancing along the street . By the light of the lamp he soon distinguished a policeman , walking with slow and measured steps along his beat . "
155132	155140	155121	155121	you	5854	" said Richard , accosting the officer : "
155152	155153	155121	155121	you	5854	" "
155157	155162	155121	155121	you	5854	" answered the policeman : "
155172	155173	155121	155121	you	5854	" "
155180	155471	155121	155121	you	5854	" ejaculated Markham , in a tone of surprise and vexation . And , truly enough , there he was in the centre of that immense assemblage of dangerous streets , cutthroat lanes , and filthy alleys , which swarm with crimps ever ready to entrap the reckless and generous - hearted sailor ; publicans who farm the unloading of the colliers , and compel those whom they employ to take out half their wages in vile adulterated beer ; and poor half - starved coal - heavers whose existence alternates between crushing toil and killing intoxication . It was in this neighbourhood that Richard Markham now was ! Heaven alone can tell what tortuous paths and circuitous routes he had been pursuing during the hour of his precipitate flight ; but his feet must have passed over many miles of ground from the instant that he emerged from the murderers ' den until he sank exhausted on the steps of a house in Ratcliff Highway . He was wet and covered with mud , and very cold . But he suddenly remembered that there was a duty which he owed to society — an imperative duty which he dared not neglect . He was impressed with the idea that Providence had that night favoured his escape from the jaws of death , in order that he might become the means of rooting up a den of horrors . There was not a moment to be lost : the three miscreants , unconscious of peril , had repaired to Shoreditch Church to exercise the least terrible portion of their avocations in that sacred edifice:—it might yet be time to secure them there ! The policeman was still standing near him . "
155482	155487	155121	155121	you	5854	" suddenly exclaimed Markham . "
155517	155518	155498	155499	the police,—I	5856	" "
155528	155533	155522	155522	you	0	" asked the officer . "
155558	155585	155553	155554	the villains	2119	" cried Richard , in a tone of excitement and with a wildness of manner which induced the officer to fancy that his brain was turned . "
155593	155598	155600	155600	you	0	" said the policeman ; "
155610	155640	155641	155641	I	0	" Markham signified his readiness to accompany the officer ; and they proceeded to the station - house in the neighbourhood . There Richard was introduced to the Superintendent . "
155646	155652	155641	155641	I	0	" said the young man , "
155698	155709	155641	155641	I	0	" added Markham , in a tone of fearful excitement , "
155821	155822	155806	155819	the three wretches whose crimes have been this night so providentially revealed to me	5869	" "
155831	155847	155848	155848	They	2109	" inquired the Superintendent , surveying Markham from head to foot in a strange manner . "
155857	155863	155864	155864	they	2109	" returned the young man ; "
155893	155894	155872	155891	a surgeon whom they were to meet at half - past one at the back of the burial - ground	5871	" "
155902	155907	155872	155891	a surgeon whom they were to meet at half - past one at the back of the burial - ground	5871	" said the Superintendent . "
155950	155951	155940	155941	some one	27192	" "
155962	155966	155940	155941	some one	27192	" ejaculated Markham ; "
155987	155988	155989	155989	My	0	" "
155993	155998	155989	155989	My	0	" interrupted the Superintendent , "
156044	156045	156046	156046	I	0	" "
156060	156065	156092	156092	he	5879	" cried Markham emphatically . "
156077	156082	156083	156087	The villain who attacked me	5879	" demanded the Superintendent . "
156114	156115	156092	156092	he	5879	" "
156123	156130	156120	156121	three murderers	5880	" whispered one policeman to another : "
156147	156148	156137	156137	He	5879	" "
156158	156162	156150	156150	I	0	" continued Markham ; "
156185	156208	156164	156164	I	0	" The two policemen turned round to conceal their inclination to laugh ; and the Superintendent could scarcely maintain a serious countenance . "
156225	156229	156230	156230	We	5885	" cried Markham . "
156261	156262	156252	156252	you	0	" "
156274	156278	156266	156266	I	0	" ejaculated Markham : "
156400	156401	156403	156403	you	0	" "
156418	156440	156403	156403	you	0	" demanded the Superintendent , moved by the solemnity and rationality with which Markham had uttered this last appeal to him . "
156447	156452	156403	156403	you	0	" was the reply : "
156547	156548	156534	156534	you	5883	" "
156563	156568	156569	156569	you	5883	" said the Superintendent ; "
156574	156575	156569	156569	you	5883	" "
156599	156749	156569	156569	you	5883	" exclaimed Markham , in a tone which inspired the Superintendent with confidence . That officer accordingly gave instructions to four constables to accompany Markham to Shoreditch Church . The little party proceeded thither with all possible expedition ; but the clock struck four just as they reached the point of destination . They hastily scaled the railings around the burial - ground , and proceeded to the very door from which the body - snatchers had emerged an hour previously . One of the policemen tried the door ; and it immediately yielded to his touch . At the same moment his foot struck against something upon the top step . He picked it up:—it was a padlock with the semicircular bolt sawed through . The policemen and Markham entered the church ; and the former commenced a strict search by means of their bull's - eye lanterns . "
156767	156774	156762	156762	he	27107	" observed one of the officers ; "
156785	156786	156789	156789	they	5895	" "
156805	156809	156810	156810	I	0	" said another . "
156816	156820	156810	156810	I	0	" remarked Richard , "
156851	156852	156833	156833	they	5895	" "

156904	156911	156888	156888	you	0	" added another police - officer , "

156944	156948	156938	156938	I	0	" said Markham ; "
156992	157033	157034	157034	You	0	" The officers and Richard accordingly returned to the station - house whence they came ; and as soon as the Superintendent heard that the church had really been broken open , he apologised to Markham for his former incredulity . "
157043	157048	157034	157034	You	0	" said this functionary , "
157072	157073	157074	157074	I	0	" "
157086	157090	157076	157076	you	0	" observed Markham . "
157100	157105	157076	157076	you	0	" answered the Superintendent : "
157150	157522	157524	157524	society	27044	" * * * * * Day dawned shortly after seven ; and at that time might be seen Richard Markham , accompanied by an officer in plain clothes , and followed by others at a distance , threading the streets and alleys in the neighbourhood of the Bird - cage Walk . The sun rose upon that labyrinth of close , narrow , and wretched thoroughfares , and irradiated those sinks of misery and crime as well as the regal palace and the lordly mansion at the opposite end of London . But the search after the house in which Markham had witnessed such horrors and endured such intense mental agony on the preceding night , was as vain and fruitless as if its existence were but a dream . There was not a street which Markham could remember having passed through ; there was not a house to which even his suspicions attached . And yet , may be , he and his official companions proceeded up the very street , and went by the door of the very house , which they sought . After a useless search throughout that neighbourhood for nearly four hours , Markham declared that he was completely at fault . The police accordingly abandoned any further proceedings on that occasion . It was however agreed between them and Markham that the strictest secresy should be preserved relative to the entire business , in order that the measures to be subsequently adopted with a view to discover the den of the murderers , might not be defeated by the tattle of busy tongues . RICHARD Markham had determined to lose no time in revealing to Count Alteroni those adventures which had rendered him an inmate of the Giltspur Street Compter for two years . And yet it was hard to dare the destruction of the bright visions which had dawned upon him in respect to the Signora Isabella : it was cruel to dash away from his lips the only cup of enjoyment which he had tasted for a long time . He knew not how the count would receive such a narrative as he had to tell . Doubtless it would alarm him : "
157526	157530	157524	157524	society	27044	" thought Richard , "
157541	157651	157652	157652	I	0	" Should the count , however , nobly and generously rise above the prejudices of the world , and believe the statement of Markham 's innocence , corroborated as it was by the document signed by Talbot , alias Pocock , much would have been gained by a candid and honourable confession . But if the reverse ensued , and the count banished Richard from his friendship , the young man felt that he himself would only have performed a melancholy duty , and broken asunder of his own accord those bonds which , were he to remain silent , an accident might one day snap abruptly and rudely . "
157656	157682	157652	157652	I	0	" said Markham to himself , as he arose in the morning after the day on which the fruitless search mentioned in the preceding chapter took place,—"I
157798	157888	157893	157893	I	0	" So reasoned Richard Markham . That evening he arrived at the count 's abode near Richmond , a few minutes before dinner . A kind welcome awaited him on the part of the count and countess ; and the eyes of Signora Isabella expressed the satisfaction she experienced at his return . When Markham was seated with the count after dinner , he determined to commence the explanation which he had resolved to give . He was just about to broach the subject , when the count observed , "
157918	157919	157909	157909	he	903	" "
157927	157931	157909	157909	he	903	" returned Richard . "
157942	157943	157909	157909	he	903	" "
157956	157961	157909	157909	he	903	" interrupted the count . "
158026	158027	158030	158030	you	0	" "
158035	158039	158030	158030	you	0	" stammered Markham . "
158063	158064	158047	158048	Mr. Greenwood	903	" "
158067	158068	158047	158048	Mr. Greenwood	903	" "
158079	158080	158072	158072	I	0	" "
158094	158098	158072	158072	I	0	" cried Richard . "
158124	158125	158105	158105	Markham	874	" "
158133	158137	158105	158105	Markham	874	" said Markham , "
158150	158151	158105	158105	Markham	874	" "
158159	158167	158105	158105	Markham	874	" exclaimed the count , somewhat haughtily ; "
158191	158308	158169	158169	I	0	" As the count uttered these words , he rose and led the way to the drawing - room ; and thus deprived Markham of that opportunity of making the confession he had intended . Richard was unhappy and dispirited . He perceived that the count was inclined to favour Mr. Greenwood 's suit ; and he now felt how dear Isabella was to him — how profoundly seated was his love for the beauteous Italian ! Misfortunes never come alone . Richard was destined to receive a crushing blow , although innocently inflicted , the moment he entered the drawing - room . The countess was conversing with her daughter upon her own family connections . "
158317	158334	158312	158312	us	5924	" said the count , as he took his seat upon the sofa near his wife . "
158353	158358	158359	158359	I	0	" observed the countess . "
158394	158395	158370	158370	I	0	" "
158400	158405	158370	158370	I	0	" inquired the count . "
158429	158434	158370	158370	I	0	" answered the countess ; "
158476	158477	158450	158450	I	0	" "
158481	158486	158450	158450	I	0	" said the count . "
158513	158514	158515	158515	I	0	" "
158525	158529	158523	158523	you	0	" observed Isabel . "
158563	158564	158550	158552	such a person	5935	" "
158570	158575	158550	158552	such a person	5935	" ejaculated the countess ; "
158597	158598	158589	158590	Mr. Markham	874	" "
158610	158625	158605	158605	I	0	" stammered Richard , whose countenance was as pale as that of a corpse . "
158652	158864	158872	158872	Isabella	1048	" With these words Markham hurried to the bed - chamber which was always allotted to him when he visited the count 's residence . All the horrible tortures which man can conceive , harassed him at that moment . He threw himself upon his couch — he writhed — he struggled , as if against a serpent which held him in its embraces . His eyes seemed as if they were about to start from their sockets ; his teeth were fast closed — he wrung his hair — he beat his breast — and low moans escaped from his bosom . The fiat of the count had gone forth . He who would claim or aspire to connection with his family must be like the wife of Cæsar — beyond all suspicion . It was not enough that such an one should be innocent of any crime : he must never have even been accused of one . Such was the disposition of the count — elicited by an accident , and unexpectedly ; and Markham could now divine the nature of the treatment which he would be likely to experience , were he to reveal his misfortunes to a nobleman who entertained such punctilious and extremely scrupulous notions ! "
158878	158893	158866	158866	I	0	" thought Markham within himself , as soon as he became somewhat more tranquillised . "
159083	159361	159069	159069	I	0	" A flood of tears relieved the unfortunate young man ; and he descended once more to the drawing - room — very pale , but as calm and tranquil as usual . Isabella glanced towards him from time to time with evident anxiety ; and , in spite of all his endeavours to appear cheerful and at his ease , he was embarrassed , cool , and reserved . Isabella was wounded and mortified by his conduct:—she attempted to rally him , and to ascertain whether he was really chilling in his manners on purpose , or only melancholy against his will : but she received frigid and laconic replies , which annoyed and disheartened the poor girl to such an extent that she could scarcely refrain from tears . Markham felt that , as an honourable man , he could no longer aspire to the hand of the signora , after the expression of opinion accidentally conveyed to him by the count and countess ; and he therefore forbore from any attempt to render himself agreeable , or to afford the slightest testimony of his passion . Acting with these views , and endeavouring to seem only properly polite , he fell into the opposite extreme , and grew cold and reserved . The count and countess imagined that he was unwell , and were not therefore annoyed by his conduct;—but poor Isabella , who was deeply attached to him , set down his behaviour to indifference . This idea on her part was confirmed , when Markham , in the course of conversation , intimated his intention of returning home on the following day . "
159369	159374	159375	159375	You	5944	" ejaculated the count . "
159395	159396	159383	159383	you	5944	" "
159418	159422	159410	159410	I	0	" said Richard . "
159435	159440	159410	159410	I	0	" cried the count . "
159464	159465	159461	159462	Lady Tremordyn	1007	" "
159469	159473	159479	159479	him	1006	" exclaimed Richard . "
159481	159482	159479	159479	him	1006	" "
159497	159509	159493	159495	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" said Markham , shuddering as he pronounced the abhorred name . "
159559	159560	159534	159534	He	1083	" "
159565	159569	159561	159563	Poor Lady Cecilia	1084	" ejaculated Isabella . "
159577	159578	159570	159570	She	1084	" "
159594	159599	159587	159587	yours	5952	" said the count . "
159607	159641	159642	159642	My	0	" added the signora , affecting to be engaged in contemplating a book of prints which lay upon the table before her , while her beautiful countenance was suffused with a deep blush . "
159649	159653	159642	159642	My	0	" observed Richard . "
159705	159706	159707	159707	You	5952	" "
159718	159723	159707	159707	You	5952	" exclaimed the count . "
159739	159745	159724	159724	We	5953	" said Markham , emphatically . "
159752	159753	159724	159724	We	5953	" "
159768	159778	159765	159766	free agents	5955	" said Isabella , still holding down her head ; "
159803	159842	159748	159748	God	880	" At this moment a servant entered the room and informed the count that the private secretary of the envoy of the Grand Duke of Castelcicala to the English court desired to speak with him in another apartment . "
159851	159931	159845	159845	I	0	" exclaimed the countess ; and , upon a signal of approval on the part of her husband , she accompanied him to the room where the secretary was waiting . Markham was now alone with Isabella . This was a probable occurrence which he had dreaded all that evening . He felt himself cruelly embarrassed in her presence ; and the silence which prevailed between them was awkward to a degree . At length the signora herself spoke . "
159945	159970	159935	159935	you	5956	" she said , without glancing towards him , and in a tone which she endeavoured to render as cool and indifferent as possible . "
159984	159995	159974	159974	I	0	" answered Richard , scarcely knowing what reply to make . "
160011	160012	159997	159997	you	5956	" "
160030	160031	160032	160033	Mr. Markham	874	" "
160065	160066	160047	160047	he	874	" "
160079	160083	160084	160084	You	5956	" ejaculated Markham . "
160185	160186	160182	160182	I	0	" "
160194	160211	160213	160213	myself	0	" said Isabella , now raising her head from the book , and glancing towards him . "
160222	160226	160219	160219	I	0	" he exclaimed : "
160302	160303	160298	160298	I	0	" "
160316	160321	160309	160310	my father	2156	" inquired Isabella timidly . "
160329	160333	160334	160334	He	2156	" answered Markham . "
160347	160348	160334	160334	He	2156	" "
160359	160363	160350	160350	I	0	" asked Isabella ; "

160535	160575	160517	160518	your father	2203	" asked the beauteous Italian , in a tone of voice rendered almost inaudible by a variety of emotions — for the heart of that innocent and charming being fluttered like a bird in the net of the fowler . "
160959	160960	160963	160963	you	0	" "
160969	160978	160963	160963	you	0	" inquired Isabella , casting down her eyes . "
161045	161046	161047	161047	You	0	" "
161056	161073	161074	161074	you	0	" murmured the lovely Italian maiden , casting down her large dark eyes and blushing deeply ; "
161079	161080	161083	161083	Isabella	1048	" "
161087	161091	161083	161083	Isabella	1048	" interrupted Richard . "
161123	161124	161114	161114	God	880	" "
161139	161158	161127	161127	I	0	" said Isabella , approaching him and laying her delicate and beautifully modelled hand lightly upon his wrist . "
161169	161232	161233	161233	You	5975	" ejaculated Markham , half wild with mingled joy and apprehensions;—and , yielding to an impulse which no mortal under such circumstances could have conquered , he caught her in his arms . He kissed her pure and chaste brow — he felt her fragrant breath upon his cheek — her hair commingled with his own — and he murmured the words , "
161237	161610	161233	161233	You	5975	" A gentle voice breathed an affirmative in his ear ; and he pressed his lips to hers to ratify that covenant of two fond hearts . Suddenly he recollected that Count Alteroni had declared that no one against whom there was even a suspicion of crime should ever form a connection with his family . Markham 's high sense of honour told him in a moment that he had no right to secure the affections of a confiding and gentle girl whose father would never yield an assent to their union : his brain , already excited , now became inflamed almost to madness;—he abruptly turned aside from her who had just avowed her attachment to him,—he muttered some incoherent words which she did not comprehend , and rushed out of the room . He hurried to the garden at the back of the house , and walked rapidly up and down a shady avenue of trees which ran along the wall that bounded the enclosure on the side of the public road . By degrees he grew calm and relaxed the speed of his pace . He then fell into a long and profound meditation upon the occurrences of the last half hour . He was beloved by Isabella , it was true;—but never might he aspire to her hand;—never could it be accorded to him to lead her to the altar where their attachment might be ratified and his happiness confirmed ! An inseparable barrier seemed to oppose itself to his wishes ; and he felt that no alternative remained to him but to put his former resolution into force , and take his departure homewards on the ensuing morning . Thus was it that he now reasoned . The moon shone brightly ; and the heavens were studded with stars . As Markham was about to turn for the twentieth time at that end of the avenue which was the more remote from the house , the beams of the moon suddenly disclosed to him a human face peering over the wall at him . He started , and was about to utter an exclamation of alarm , when a well - known voice fell upon his ears . "
161613	161620	161233	161233	You	5975	" was the word first spoken ; "
161648	161649	161652	161654	miscreant — murderer	5977	" "
161656	161660	161652	161654	miscreant — murderer	5977	" exclaimed Richard ; "
161675	161676	161677	161677	Fool	27204	" "
161679	161691	161677	161677	Fool	27204	" coolly returned the Resurrection Man — for it was he ; "
161704	161705	161677	161677	Fool	27204	" "
161708	161718	161677	161677	Fool	27204	" cried Markham , stamping his foot with vexation . "
161730	161731	161720	161720	God	880	" "
161745	161755	161720	161720	God	880	" said the Resurrection Man , with diabolical irony . "
161784	161785	161788	161788	you	5976	" "
161815	161816	161870	161870	you	5976	" "
161823	161867	161870	161870	you	5976	" The moon shone full upon the cadaverous and unearthly countenance of the Resurrection Man , and revealed the expression of ferocious rage which it wore as he uttered these words . That vile and foreboding face then suddenly disappeared behind the wall . "
161876	161892	161870	161870	you	5976	" cried the voice of the count , who was now advancing down the avenue . "
161896	161904	161870	161870	you	5976	" repeated Richard , alarmed and confused . "
161917	161922	161915	161915	you	5976	" said the count . "
161931	161935	161925	161929	a man in the road	5982	" answered Markham . "
162050	162051	162042	162042	you	5976	" "
162058	162063	162052	162053	Mr. Armstrong	994	" said Markham inquiringly . "
162117	162176	162113	162115	their deceased relative	5996	" Markham accompanied the count back to the drawing - room , where Captain Smilax Dapper had seated himself next to the signora ; and Sir Cherry Bounce was endeavouring to divert the countess with an account of their journey that evening from London . They both coloured deeply and bowed very politely when Richard entered the apartment . "
162184	162189	162180	162180	I	0	" continued Sir Cherry , "
162242	162243	162239	162239	I	0	" "
162257	162267	162268	162272	A countryman who passed by	6000	" ejaculated the gallant hussar , caressing his moustache . "
162314	162315	162305	162305	I	0	" "
162349	162350	162345	162346	the twathe	6005	" "
162359	162364	162365	162365	I	0	" said the count . "
162381	162387	162377	162377	I	0	" cried the young officer ; "
162402	162403	162390	162391	the signora	5333	" "
162412	162418	162406	162406	I	0	" said Isabella , laughing . "
162440	162441	162427	162427	I	0	" "
162449	162471	162427	162427	I	0	" observed Captain Dapper , as he turned over the leaves of the book which the beautiful Italian presented to him . "
162517	162518	162584	162584	yourself	6006	" "
162521	162527	162528	162529	The wiver	6011	" ejaculated Sir Cherry Bounce . "
162561	162562	162557	162557	thith	6015	" "
162568	162573	162557	162557	thith	6015	" said the signora . "

162588	162593	162584	162584	yourself	6006	" said the count . "
162604	162629	162602	162602	you	6006	" Isabella accordingly read the following stanzas in a tone of voice that added a new charm to the words themselves : — LONDON . "
162635	162640	162602	162602	you	6006	" exclaimed Captain Dapper . "
162651	162652	162602	162602	you	6006	" "
162677	162678	162669	162675	the thame perthon that painted the landthcape	6019	" "
162683	162687	162688	162688	His	6019	" answered Isabella . "
162695	162696	162688	162688	His	6019	" "
162704	162708	162709	162710	Robert Montgomery	1086	" exclaimed Dapper . "
162714	162727	162709	162710	Robert Montgomery	1086	" said Isabella , smiling with a charmingly arch expression of countenance . "
162733	163334	162730	162731	Wichard Markham	1087	" cried Sir Cherry ; and then he and his friend the hussar captain were excessively annoyed to think that they had been extolling to the skies the performances of an individual who had frightened the one out of his wits , and boxed the ears of the other . Thus passed the evening ; but Markham was reserved and melancholy . It was in vain that Isabella exerted herself to instil confidence into his mind , by means of those thousand little attentions and manifestations of preference which lovers know so well how to exhibit , but which those around perceive not . Richard was firm in those resolutions which he deemed consistent with propriety and honour ; and he deeply regretted the explanation and its consequences into which the enthusiasm of the moment had that evening led him . At length the hour for retiring to rest arrived . Richard repaired to his chamber — but not to sleep . His mind was too much harassed by the events of the evening — the plans which he had pursued , and those which he intended to pursue — the love which he bore to Isabel , and the stern opposition which might be anticipated from her father — the persecution to which he was subject at the hands of the Resurrection Man — and the train of evil fortune which appeared constantly to attend upon him;—of all these he thought ; and his painful meditations defied the advance of slumber . The window of his bed - chamber overlooked the garden at the back of the house ; from which direction a strange and alarming noise suddenly broke in upon his reflections . He listened — and all was quiet : he therefore felt convinced that his terror was unfounded . A few moments elapsed ; and he was again alarmed by a sound which seemed like the jarring of an unfastened shutter . A certain uneasiness now took possession of him ; and he was determined to ascertain whether all was safe about the premises . He leapt from his bed , raised the window , and looked forth . The night was now pitch dark ; and he could distinguish nothing . Not even were the outlines of the trees in the garden discernible amidst that profound and dense obscurity . Markham held his breath ; and the whispering of voices met his ears . He could not , however , distinguish a word they uttered:—a low hissing continuous murmur , the nature of which it was impossible to mistake , convinced him that some persons were talking together immediately beneath his window . In a few moments the jarring of a door or shutter , which he had before heard , was repeated ; and then the whispering ceased . By this time his eyes had become accustomed to the darkness ; and he could now faintly discern the outlines of three human forms standing together at the back door of the house . He could not , however , distinguish the precise nature of their present employment . It was , nevertheless , evident to him that they were not there with any honest intention in view ; and he resolved to adopt immediate measures to defeat their burglarious schemes . He hastily threw on his clothes , struck a light , and issued from his room . Cautiously advancing along a passage was the count , only half - dressed , with a pistol in each hand and a cutlass under his arm . "
163339	163344	163345	163345	I	0	" whispered the count : "
163393	163438	163388	163391	the men - servants	6024	" The count hurried down stairs , followed by Markham , and the three male domestics of the household . A noise was heard in the pantry , which was situate at the back of the house on the same level with the hall . "
163450	163470	163388	163391	the men - servants	6024	" cried a hoarse gruff voice , as the count , Richard , and the servants approached the pantry : "
163483	163574	163575	163575	Wretch	1062	" The count rushed forward , and burst open the door of the pantry , closely followed by Markham , holding the candle . Two of the burglars made a desperate push down the kitchen stairs and escaped : the third was captured in an attempt to follow his companions . The light of the candle fell upon the villain 's countenance , which was literally ghastly with a mingled expression of rage and alarm . Richard shuddered : for the captured burglar was no other than the Resurrection Man . "
163577	163587	163575	163575	Wretch	1062	" exclaimed Markham , recovering his self - command : "
163596	163597	163575	163575	Wretch	1062	" "
163606	163617	163601	163601	you	6026	" demanded the count , somewhat surprised by the observation . "
163621	163627	163630	163630	he	27255	" cried the Resurrection Man : "
163665	163666	163658	163658	you	1062	" "
163696	163697	163700	163700	your	1062	" "
163731	163732	163733	163733	Miscreant	28603	" "
163735	163739	163733	163733	Miscreant	28603	" cried Markham : "
163750	163751	163733	163733	Miscreant	28603	" "
163760	163765	163733	163733	Miscreant	28603	" said the count : "
163823	163824	163810	163810	I	0	" "
163829	163833	163827	163827	count	29320	" exclaimed Markham : "
163847	163848	163827	163827	count	29320	" "
163855	163861	163827	163827	count	29320	" said the count authoritatively : "
163877	163878	163869	163869	him	2092	" "
163890	163896	163880	163880	you	27322	" continued the Resurrection Man . "
163936	163937	163913	163913	He	29649	" "
163942	163954	163938	163940	Miscreant — murderer	5977	" exclaimed Markham , no longer able to contain his indignation : "
163970	163971	163938	163940	Miscreant — murderer	5977	" "
163974	163979	163938	163940	Miscreant — murderer	5977	" said the count . "
164015	164016	164008	164008	I	0	" "
164032	164033	164019	164019	count	29320	" "
164039	164049	164037	164037	Markham	874	" interrupted the Italian noble , with dignified firmness : "
164059	164060	164061	164065	The villain I allude to	6049	" "
164072	164078	164070	164070	Markham	874	" continued the Resurrection Man . "
164109	164110	164081	164081	him	27445	" "
164120	164174	164081	164081	him	27445	" almost screamed the distracted Markham , as this totally unexpected and unfounded accusation met his ears . The count himself was shocked at this announcement ; for he suddenly recollected Richard 's moody , embarrassed , and thoughtful manner the whole evening , and his sudden intention of departing the next day . "
164178	164183	164081	164081	him	27445	" said the count . "
164189	164201	164186	164187	that man	3239	" continued the body - snatcher , pointing contemptuously towards Markham , "
164251	164252	164242	164242	I	0	" "
164266	164276	164254	164254	you	874	" began Markham , unable to restrain his feelings . "
164281	164292	164279	164279	Markham	874	" exclaimed the count , still more authoritatively than before . "
164300	164301	164279	164279	Markham	874	" "
164312	164318	164323	164323	he	3239	" continued the Resurrection Man ; "
164335	164336	164323	164323	he	3239	" "
164340	164345	164337	164338	Merciful God	6058	" cried the count : "
164352	164353	164323	164323	he	3239	" "
164364	164366	164358	164358	I	0	" said Richard,—"and
164373	164374	164358	164358	I	0	" "
164384	164412	164375	164376	Mr. Markham	874	" exclaimed the count emphatically , while a cold perspiration burst out upon his forehead ; for he had recalled to mind the incident respecting the garden . "
164422	164428	164420	164420	count	29320	" said the Resurrection Man . "
164542	164543	164534	164534	Markham	874	" "
164546	164557	164534	164534	Markham	874	" ejaculated the count , with a thrill of horror . "
164595	164643	164644	164644	Isabella	1048	" Scarcely were these terrible words uttered by the Resurrection Man , when a loud — long — and piercing scream was heard , coming from the direction of the staircase ; and then some object instantly fell with violence upon the marble floor of the hall . "
164648	164661	164646	164646	Isabella	1048	" ejaculated Markham , turning hastily round to hurry to her assistance . "
164671	164692	164646	164646	Isabella	1048	" cried the count , in a stern voice , as he caught Richard 's arm and held him back . "
164702	164839	164646	164646	Isabella	1048	" There was a noble and dignified air of command about Count Alteroni , as he uttered these words , which could not escape the notice of Richard Markham , even amidst the crushing and overwhelming circumstances that surrounded him . The count took the candle from Markham 's hand , and hastened to the aid of his daughter , who , half - dressed , was lying upon the cold marble of the hall . He hastened to raise her ; and at that moment the countess appeared upon the stairs , followed by a lady's - maid bearing a lamp . The count reassured her in respect to the safety of the house , consigned Isabella to her care , and then returned to the pantry , where his presence was awaited in silence . "
164848	164857	164841	164841	you	6070	" demanded the count of the Resurrection Man . "
164864	164873	164862	164862	I	0	enough?"—and he glanced with fiendish triumph towards Markham . "
164878	164887	164876	164876	sir	26649	" said the count , turning to Richard ; "
164899	164900	164876	164876	sir	26649	" "
164941	164942	164951	164951	God	880	" "
164973	164986	164987	164988	Count Alteroni	1047	" The count uttered these words in a tone of intense agony . "
164997	165001	165004	165004	your	1047	" said Richard . "
165019	165045	165046	165046	You	1047	" Markham handed the document signed by Talbot , alias Pocock , to the count ; but the nobleman tossed it indignantly on the floor . "
165088	165187	165190	165190	sir	26649	" Vainly did Markham endeavour to obtain a hearing . The count silenced him with an air of command and an imposing dignity of manner that struck him with awe . Never did the Italian nobleman appear more really noble than when he was thus performing that which he considered to be an imperious duty . His fine form was drawn up to its full height — his chest expanded — his cheeks were flushed — and his eyes flashed fire . Yes — even beneath his dark complexion was the rich Italian blood seen mantling his countenance . "
165258	165740	165252	165254	my innocent daughter	6089	" With these words the colonel pushed Markham rudely from the pantry , and ordered a servant to conduct him to the front door . The blood of the young man boiled in his veins at this ignominious treatment;—and yet he dared not rebel against it ! The Resurrection Man took his departure at the same time by the garden at the back of the house . As Markham turned down the shrubbery , a window on the third floor of the count 's dwelling was thrown open ; and the voices of Sir Cherry Bounce and the Honourable Captain Dapper were heard loading him with abuse . Bowed down to the earth by the weight of the misfortune which had just fallen upon his head,—crushed by unjust and unfounded suspicions,—and sinking beneath a sense of shame and degradation , which all his innocence did not deprive of a single pang,—Markham dragged himself away from the house in which he had passed so many happy hours , and where he left behind him all that he held dear in this life . He seated himself upon a mile - stone at a little distance from the count 's mansion , to which he turned his eyes to take a last farewell of the place where Isabella resided . Lights were moving about in several rooms;—perhaps she was ill ? Most assuredly she had heard the dread accusations which had issued from the lips of the Resurrection Man against her lover;—and she would haply believe them all ? So thought Richard . Human language can not convey an adequate idea of the heart - rending misery which the poor oppressed young man endured as he sate by the road - side , and pondered upon all that had just occurred . Shame upon shame — degradation upon degradation — mountain upon mountain rolled on his breast , as if he were a modern Titan , to crush him and keep him down — never more to rise;—this was now his fate ! At length , afraid of being left alone with his own thoughts , which seemed to urge him to end his earthly woes in the blood of a suicide , he rose from the cold stone , turned one last sorrowful and lingering glance towards the mansion in the distance , and then hurried along the road to Richmond as if he were pursued by bloodhounds . And not more fearful nor more appalling would those bloodhounds have been than the horrible and excruciating thoughts which haunted him upon his way , and of which he could not divest himself ; so that at length a species of delirium seized upon him as he ran furiously onward , the mark of Cain appearing to burn like red - hot iron upon his brow , and a terrible voice thundering in his ear—"Freed
165743	166262	165252	165254	my innocent daughter	6089	" THE reader will remember that the events already related have brought us up to the close of 1838 . Thus three years had elapsed since the memorable trial which resulted in the condemnation of Eliza Sydney to an imprisonment of twenty - four long months in Newgate ; and a year had passed since her release from that dread abode . We therefore return to her again in December , 1838 — about the same time that those incidents occurred which we detailed in the last few chapters . Probably to the surprise of the reader , we again find Eliza Sydney the mistress of the beautiful villa at Upper Clapton . Yes : on the evening when we once more introduce ourselves to her , she was sitting alone in the drawing - room of that home , reading by the side of a cheerful fire . She was now twenty - eight years of age ; and , although somewhat more inclining to embonpoint than when we first described her , she was still a lovely and fascinating woman . That slightly increased roundness of form had given her charms a voluptuousness the most ravishing and seductive , but the effects of which upon the beholder were attempered by the dignity that reigned upon her high and noble brow , and the chaste expression of her melting hazel eyes . She was one of those fine creatures — one of those splendid specimens of the female sex , which are alone seen in the cold climates of the north ; for it appears to be a rule in nature that the flowers of our species expand into the most luscious loveliness in the least genial latitudes . There was a soft melancholy in the expression of her countenance , which might have been mistaken for languor , and which gave an additional charm to her appearance ; for it was easy to perceive her mind was now at ease , that delicate shade of sadness being the indelible effect of the adventures of the past . Her mind was at ease , because she was pure in heart and virtuous in intention,—because she knew that she had erred innocently when she lent herself to the fraud for which she had suffered,—because she possessed a competency that secured her against care for the present and fear for the future,—and because she dwelt in that strict solitude and retirement which she loved , and which was congenial to a soul that had seen enough of the world to learn to dread its cruel artifices and deceptive ways . We said that it was evening when we again introduce Eliza to the readers . A cold wind whistled without ; and a huge Christmas log burnt at the back of the grate , giving an air of supreme comfort to that tastefully - furnished room . The French porcelain time - piece upon the mantel proclaimed the hour of eight . Scarcely had the silvery chime ceased , when Louisa entered the room in great haste and excitement . "
166274	166285	166269	166269	you	26745	" she cried , closing the door carefully behind her . "
166296	166302	166294	166294	Louisa	900	" said Eliza , smiling . "
166306	166311	166313	166313	he	899	" exclaimed the servant : "
166320	166321	166313	166313	he	899	" "
166325	166329	166313	166313	he	899	" echoed Eliza . "
166332	166333	166336	166336	him	899	" "
166354	166355	166336	166336	him	899	" "
166359	166363	166356	166357	Mr. Stephens	899	" repeated Eliza . "
166397	166398	166399	166399	He	899	" "
166414	166419	166408	166408	he	899	" said Louisa emphatically ; "
166451	166452	166444	166444	he	899	" "
166460	166466	166454	166454	he	899	" said Eliza , musing . "
166471	166481	166454	166454	he	899	" There was a pause of a few moments . "
166487	166500	166482	166482	I	0	" exclaimed Eliza , in a decided tone , after some consideration . "
166528	166593	166516	166516	he	899	" Louisa left the room : and in another minute the convict Stephens stood in the presence of Eliza Sydney . Altered ! he was indeed altered . His eyes were sunken and lustreless — his cheeks wan and hollow — his hair prematurely tinged with grey — and his form thin and emaciated . He was moreover clad in rags — absolute rags . "
166597	166601	166516	166516	he	899	" ejaculated Eliza : "
166614	166615	166516	166516	he	899	" "
166636	166644	166645	166645	You	899	" said Stephens in a hollow voice . "

166673	166677	166680	166680	you	899	" exclaimed Eliza : "

166695	166701	166689	166689	I	0	" replied Stephens , sorrowfully . "
166715	166801	166802	166802	I	0	" The unhappy man sank upon a chair as he uttered these words ; and Eliza summoned Louisa to bring refreshments . The servant placed a tray laden with provisions upon the table , and retired . Stephens then fell ravenously upon the food thus set before him ; while tears stood in Eliza 's eyes when she thought that the miserable wretch had once commanded in that house where he now craved a morsel of bread ! At length the convict terminated his meal . "
166807	166811	166802	166802	I	0	" he said , "
166884	166894	166988	166988	You	6101	" he added , in a strange satirical manner : "
166901	166923	166988	166988	You	6101	" then , linking his voice almost to a whisper , he said in a tone of profound and touching melancholy , "
166935	166936	166925	166925	you	6101	" "
166943	166987	166937	166937	You	0	" said Eliza , wiping away the tears from her eyes ; for at that moment she remembered not the injury brought by that man upon herself — she saw and knew of nought save the misery of the hapless being before her . "
166993	166997	166998	166998	you	6101	" exclaimed Stephens , "
167010	167011	166998	166998	you	6101	" "

167038	167046	167035	167036	Excellent woman	6102	" cried the convict , deeply affected . "

168043	168054	168040	168041	an outcast	6154	" said Stephens , in a tone of bitter remorse . "

168516	168525	168504	168504	He	903	" said Eliza , with a slight blush ; "

168556	168560	168546	168546	my	0	" observed Stephens . "

168792	168811	168782	168782	Eliza	902	" interrupted Stephens , joy and hope animating his care - worn countenance and firing his sunken eyes . "
168817	168821	168782	168782	Eliza	902	" said Eliza . "
168846	168853	168858	168858	I	0	this,"—and she handed him her purse . "
168886	169533	169534	169534	Your	6178	" Stephens shed tears as he received the purse from the fair hand of that noble - hearted woman . He then took his departure with a heart far more light than when he had knocked humbly and timidly at the door of that villa an hour before . MR . Greenwood was seated in his study the morning after the event which occupied the last chapter . He was dressed en negligé . A French velvet skull - cap , embroidered with gold , sate upon his curled and perfumed hair : a sumptuous brocade silk dressing - gown was confined around the waist by a gold cord with large tassels hanging almost to his feet : his shirt collar was turned down over a plain broad black riband , the bow of which was fastened with a diamond broach of immense value ; and on his fingers were costly rings , sparkling with stones of corresponding kind and worth . On the writing - table an elegant French watch attached to a long gold chain , lay amidst a pile of letters , just as if it had been carelessly tossed there . A cheque , partly filled up for a thousand guineas,—several bank - notes , and some loose gold , were lying on an open writing - desk ; and , at one end of the table lay , in seeming confusion , a number of visiting cards bearing the names of eminent capitalists , wealthy merchants , peers , and members of Parliament . All this pell - mell assemblage of proofs of wealth and tokens of high acquaintance , was only apparent — and not real . It was a portion of Mr. Greenwood 's system — one of the principles of the art which he practised in deceiving the world . He knew none of the capitalists , and few of the aristocrats whose cards lay upon his table : and his own hand had arranged the manner in which the watch , the cheque - book , and the money were tossing about . Never did a coquet practise a particular glance , attitude , or mannerism , more seriously than did Mr. Greenwood these little artifices which , however trifling they may appear , produced an immense effect upon those with whom he had to deal , and who visited him in that study . Every thing he did was the result of a calculation , and had an aim : every word he spoke , however rapid the utterance , was duly weighed and measured . And yet at this time the man who thus carried his knowledge of human nature even to the most ridiculous niceties , was only in his twenty - eighth year . How perverted were great talents — how misapplied an extraordinary quickness of apprehension in this instance ! Mr. Greenwood contemplated the arrangements of his writing - table with calm satisfaction ; and a smile of triumph curled his lip as he thought of the position to which such little artifices as those had helped to raise him . He despised the world : he laughed at society ; and he cared not for the law — for he walked boldly up to the extreme verge where personal security ceased and peril began ; but he never over - stepped the boundary . He had plundered many — he had enriched himself with the wealth of others — he had built his own fortunes upon the ruins of his fellow men 's hopes and prospects : but still he had so contrived all his schemes that the law could never reach him , and if one of his victims accused him of villany he had a plausible explanation to offer for his conduct . If a person said to him , "
169550	169555	169558	169559	the man	2092	possessed,"—he would unblushingly reply , "
169631	169910	169911	169911	Lafleur	1064	" And this language would prove satisfactory and seem straight - forward to all by - standers , save the poor victim himself , who nevertheless would be struck dumb by the other 's assurance . Greenwood had commenced his ways of intrigue and pursuits of duplicity in the City , where he was known as George Montague . The moment he had obtained a considerable fortune , he repaired to the West End , added the name of Greenwood to his other appellations , and thus commenced , as it were , a new existence in a new sphere . He possessed the great advantage of exercising a complete control over all his feelings , passions , and inclinations — save with respect to women . In this point of view he was a complete sensualist — a heartless voluptuary . He would spare neither expense nor trouble to gratify his amorous desires , where he formed a predilection ; and if in any case he would run a risk of involving himself in the complexities of civil or criminal law , the peril would be encountered in an attempt to satisfy his lustful cravings . There are many men of this stamp in the world,—especially in great cities — and , more especially still , in London . Mr. Greenwood , having completed the arrangements of his study in the manner described , rang the bell . His French valet Lafleur made his appearance in answer to the summons . Mr. Greenwood then threw himself negligently into the arm - chair at his writing - table , and proceeded to issue his instructions to his dependant . "
169936	169951	169922	169922	he	1047	" He handed his valet a letter , sealed , and addressed to himself . "
170012	170013	170009	170009	you	26649	" "
170018	170054	170009	170009	you	26649	" answered Lafleur , without the slightest variation of countenance ; for he was too politic and too finished a valet to attempt to criticise his master 's proceedings by means of even a look . "
170061	170066	170009	170009	you	26649	" resumed Mr. Greenwood . "
170085	170086	170089	170089	sir	26649	" "

170517	170612	170515	170515	sir	26649	" Thus ended the morning 's instructions . The valet took the letter ( which Mr. Greenwood had written to himself , ) the duplicates , and the bank notes ; and retired . In half an hour he returned with a small purple morocco case containing a complete set of diamonds , worth at least twelve hundred guineas . He again withdrew , and returned in a few minutes;—but this time it was to usher in Count Alteroni . Mr. Greenwood received the Italian noble with more than usual affability and apparent friendship . "
170624	170634	170613	170613	I	0	" he said , when they were both seated , "
170718	170719	170707	170707	he	6221	" "

170830	170841	170814	170817	one of his clerks	6223	" said the count , evidently pleased at this arrangement . "
170848	170853	170814	170817	one of his clerks	6223	" said Mr. Greenwood ; "
170864	170865	170866	170866	You	6218	" "

171123	171128	171129	171129	You	6218	" said Mr. Greenwood . "

171317	171321	171277	171277	He	6228	" inquired Greenwood . "
171327	171332	171333	171333	His	6252	" answered the count . "
171338	171339	171333	171334	His partisans	6254	" "
171353	171357	171342	171342	I	0	" said Greenwood , "
171378	171405	171407	171407	you	6255	" At that moment the door opened ; and Lafleur entered , bearing a letter , which he handed to Mr. Greenwood . He then retired . "
171411	171443	171407	171407	you	6255	" said Greenwood to the count ; then , opening the letter , he appeared to read it with attention . At the expiration of a few moments , he said , "
171478	171479	171467	171467	he	6258	" "
171490	171500	171467	171467	he	6258	" exclaimed the count in a tone of vexation . "
171513	171518	171519	171519	You	6255	" cried Mr. Greenwood . "
171529	171578	171519	171519	You	6255	" With these words he handed to the count the letter which he had written to himself in a feigned hand , and to which he had affixed a fictitious name and address . The count read the letter and was satisfied . He then rose to depart . "
171625	171626	171622	171623	Lord Tremordyn	1006	" "
171637	171641	171628	171628	I	0	" said Greenwood , "

171703	171714	171715	171715	Villany	1089	" ejaculated Greenwood , in a tone of unfeigned surprise . "
171720	171725	171726	171726	He	1089	" cried the count . "
171740	171741	171726	171726	He	1089	" "
171744	171758	171772	171772	he	1089	" said Greenwood , this time affecting the astonishment expressed by his countenance . "
171799	171800	171786	171786	he	1089	" "
171807	171812	171786	171786	he	1089	" said Greenwood emphatically ; "
171819	171820	171813	171813	you	0	" "
171854	171862	171847	171847	I	0	" The count then took his departure . "
171866	171884	171864	171864	God	880	" said Mr. Greenwood to himself , the moment the door had closed behind the Italian nobleman : "
172033	172340	171993	171993	he	1089	" Mr. Greenwood 's meditations were interrupted by the entrance of Lord Tremordyn . This nobleman was a short , stout , good - tempered man . Being a large landholder , he exercised considerable influence in his county , of which he was lord - lieutenant ; and he boasted that he could return six members to parliament in spite of the Reform - bill . His wife was moreover allied to one of the richest and most important families in the hierarchy of the aristocracy ; and thus Lord Tremordyn — with no talent , no knowledge , no acquirements to recommend him , but with certain political tenets which he inherited along with the family estate , and which he professed for no other reason than because they were those of his ancestors,—Lord Tremordyn , we say , was a very great man in the House of Lords . He seldom spoke , it is true ; but then he voted — and dictated to others how to vote ; and in this existed his power . When he did speak , he uttered an awful amount of nonsense ; but the reporters were very kind — and so his speeches read well . Indeed , he did not know them again when he perused them in print the morning after their delivery . Moreover , his wife was a blue - stocking , and dabbled a little in politics ; and she occasionally furnished her noble husband with a few hints which might have been valuable had he clothed them in language a little intelligible . For the rest , Lord Tremordyn was a most hospitable man , was fond of his bottle , and fancied himself a sporting character because he kept hounds and horses , and generally employed an agent to "
172345	172358	172359	172359	My	0	" for him at races , whereby he was most amazingly plundered . "
172363	172376	172359	172359	My	0	" exclaimed Mr. Greenwood , conducting his noble visitor to a seat ; "
172404	172405	172395	172395	I	0	" "

172558	172559	172544	172545	Lady Tremordyn	1007	" "
172569	172587	172544	172545	Lady Tremordyn	1007	" said Mr. Greenwood , apparently musing ; then , after a brief pause , he added , "

172626	172627	172598	172598	I	0	" "

172685	172690	172678	172678	I	0	" observed his lordship . "

172728	172746	172723	172723	you	6285	" added the nobleman , seriously meaning what he said without any attempt at irony or satire . "

173187	173212	173213	173213	you	6184	" said Greenwood , with the calmness of a man who had never entertained a fear of being ultimately enabled to carry his point : "

173362	173384	173351	173351	I	0	" said Greenwood , in a meek and submissive manner : then , after a moment 's silence , he added , "
173425	173426	173422	173423	Lady Tremordyn	1007	" "
173460	173461	173463	173463	you	6184	" "
173470	173482	173463	173463	you	6184	" said Greenwood , sinking his voice to a mysterious whisper , "
173527	173528	173529	173529	I	0	" "
173538	173542	173532	173532	you	6184	" exclaimed the nobleman "
173551	173552	173532	173532	you	6184	" "
173568	173572	173553	173554	The count	26666	" said Greenwood . "
173598	173599	173591	173591	I	0	" "
173610	173654	173607	173607	your	6184	" After a little more conversation in the same strain , the nobleman took his leave , more pleased with Mr. Greenwood than ever . This gentleman , the moment he was alone , threw himself into his chair , and smiled complacently . "
173660	173666	173667	173667	I	0	" he said , musing . "
173725	173733	173734	173736	Lady Cecilia Harborough	1008	" The French valet entered the room . "
173746	174042	173734	173736	Lady Cecilia Harborough	1008	" Mr. Greenwood thrust the morocco case containing the diamonds into the pocket of his dressing - gown ; and then proceeded to the apartment where the lady was waiting . Lady Cecilia Harborough was about two - and - twenty , and very beautiful . Her hair was auburn , her eyes blue , and her features regular . Her figure was good ; but she was very slightly made — a perfect sylph in symmetry and model . Nursed amidst fashionable pleasure and aristocratic dissipation , she was without those principles which are the very basis of virtue . If she were true and faithful to her husband , it was only because she had not been strongly tempted to prove otherwise : if she had never indulged in an intrigue , it was simply because one to her taste had never come in her way . Her passions were strong — her disposition decidedly sensual . Thus was it that she had become an easy prey to Sir Rupert Harborough ; and when she had discovered that she was in a way to become a mother in consequence of that amour , she only repented of her conduct through dread of shame , and not for the mere fact of having deviated from the path of virtue . Her disgrace was concealed by a patched - up marriage with her seducer , a trip to the Continent , and the death of the child at its birth ; and thus there was no scandal in society attached to the name of Lady Cecilia Harborough . Mr. Greenwood had not made her wait many moments when he entered the drawing - room . Lady Cecilia rose , and hastening towards him , said , "
174067	174068	174050	174050	you	903	" "
174077	174094	174050	174050	you	903	" said Greenwood , handing her to a seat , and taking a chair near her , "
174112	174113	174096	174096	you	1008	" "
174132	174138	174125	174125	you	903	" inquired the lady impatiently . "
174169	174170	174172	174172	you	903	" "
174198	174209	174192	174192	you	903	head;"—and a smile played upon the fair patrician 's lips . "
174238	174239	174225	174225	I	0	" "
174245	174267	174225	174225	I	0	" said Lady Cecilia , with that easy familiarity which is always shown towards those who are confidants in cases of pecuniary embarrassment,—"you
174325	174326	174327	174327	Your	903	" "
174371	174372	174359	174360	your ladyship	6346	" "
174382	174389	174379	174380	Mr. Greenwood	903	" ejaculated Lady Cecilia , emphatically . "
174410	174411	174402	174403	Sir Rupert	887	" "
174419	174420	174421	174421	He	887	" "
174484	174485	174564	174564	He	887	" "
174491	174495	174564	174564	He	887	" said Greenwood . "
174524	174551	174517	174519	the very pawnbroker	6361	" Lady Cecilia stared at Mr. Greenwood in profound astonishment : then , as a sudden idea seemed to flash across her brain , she added , "
174562	174563	174564	174564	He	887	" "
174567	174568	174564	174564	He	887	" "
174573	174578	174570	174570	you	903	" continued the lady , "
174611	174612	174605	174609	a trusty servant of ours	6363	" "
174623	174627	174628	174628	I	0	" said Greenwood . "
174639	174640	174645	174645	he	887	" "
174656	174661	174662	174662	He	887	" exclaimed Lady Cecilia . "
174683	174684	174676	174676	he	887	" "
174692	174708	174686	174686	you	0	" inquired Mr. Greenwood , drawing his chair closer to that of his fair visitor . "
174728	174739	174740	174740	I	0	" said Lady Cecilia , tears starting into her eyes . "
174841	174842	174804	174804	she	1092	" "
174856	174861	174843	174843	You	0	" said Greenwood interrogatively . "
174901	174902	174903	174903	You	0	" "
174918	174923	174909	174909	You	0	" repeated Greenwood emphatically . "
174957	174958	174954	174954	his	6365	" "
174970	174983	174967	174967	you	903	" exclaimed the lady , a slight flush appearing upon her cheeks . "
175062	175063	175050	175051	Dr. Faustus	1093	" "
175080	175085	175094	175094	himself	2001	" said Mr. Greenwood , "
175123	175124	175094	175094	himself	2001	" "
175143	175148	175094	175094	himself	2001	" returned Lady Cecilia : "
175187	175214	175166	175166	I	0	" Greenwood caught hold of Lady Cecilia 's hand , fell at her feet , and presented her with the purple morocco case containing the diamonds . "
175217	175231	175233	175233	you	0	" she exclaimed , half inclined to suppose that this proceeding was a mere jest,—"what
175257	175258	175240	175240	you	0	" "
175271	175275	175240	175240	you	0	" said Greenwood . "
175302	175303	175290	175290	your	0	" "
175309	175335	175336	175336	you	903	" exclaimed the fair patrician lady , abandoning her left hand to this bold admirer , and receiving the case of diamonds with the right ; "
175353	175354	175355	175355	You	0	" "
175388	175389	175395	175395	you	903	" "
175423	175424	175407	175407	I	0	" "
175433	175452	175407	175407	I	0	" said Greenwood , who was himself astonished at the ease with which he had obtained this victory : "
175509	175510	175524	175524	yours	0	" "
175526	175530	175524	175524	yours	0	" murmured Cecilia . "
175629	175630	175624	175624	you	0	" "
175633	175704	175624	175624	you	0	" answered the libertine ; and he caught that frail but beauteous lady in his arms . * * * * * An hour elapsed : Lady Cecilia had taken her departure , richer in purse but poorer in honour;—and Greenwood had returned to his study . The flush of triumph was upon his brow ; and the smile of satisfaction was upon his lip . Lafleur entered the room . "
175712	175717	175710	175710	sir	26649	" said the valet , "
175751	175752	175741	175741	He	887	" "
175759	175824	175825	175825	You	6376	" The valet bowed and withdrew . Mr. Greenwood then wrote several letters connected with the various schemes which he had in hand . His occupation was interrupted by the entrance of Sir Rupert Harborough . With what ease and assurance — with what unblushing confidence did the libertine receive the man whose wife he had drawn into the snares of infamy and dishonour ! "
175837	175860	175825	175825	You	6376	" said Sir Rupert , who perceived by Greenwood 's attire that he had not been out of the house that morning ; "
175882	175883	175884	175884	I	0	" "
175894	175898	175889	175889	you	6376	" said Greenwood ; "
175918	175919	175943	175944	Lord Tremordyn	1006	" "
175926	175931	175943	175944	Lord Tremordyn	1006	" exclaimed Sir Rupert . "
175979	175980	175981	175981	I	0	" "
175993	175997	175981	175981	I	0	" observed Greenwood . "
176028	176029	176015	176015	I	0	" "
176034	176039	176015	176015	I	0	" interrupted the baronet ; "
176070	176071	176058	176058	he	29411	" "
176096	176097	176075	176075	he	29411	" "
176109	176110	176100	176101	Lady Cecilia	1008	" "
176132	176133	176114	176115	Lord Tremordyn	1006	" "
176143	176151	176137	176138	the devil	3259	" exclaimed the baronet , almost distracted . "
176175	176232	176233	176233	You	0	" Mr. Greenwood reflected for some minutes ; and this time his thoughtful manner was not affected . It struck him that he might effect a certain arrangement in this instance by which he might get the baronet completely in his power , and lay out some money at an enormous interest at the same time . "
176236	176241	176242	176242	you	0	" said Mr. Greenwood , "
176253	176254	176242	176242	you	0	" "
176259	176264	176242	176242	you	0	" answered Sir Rupert : "
176280	176281	176302	176303	Lord Tremordyn	1006	" "
176293	176298	176302	176303	Lord Tremordyn	1006	" pursued Mr. Greenwood , "
176332	176333	176318	176318	I	0	" "
176345	176346	176343	176343	Greenwood	903	" "
176400	176401	176394	176394	you	0	" "
176405	176422	176394	176394	you	0	" said the baronet , in a subdued tone , as if he breathed with difficulty . "
176435	176440	176441	176441	I	0	" replied Mr. Greenwood . "
176449	176455	176447	176447	you	0	" exclaimed Sir Rupert Harborough : "
176468	176469	176470	176470	I	0	" "
176479	176480	176470	176470	I	0	" "
176488	176510	176482	176482	I	0	" And the baronet departed to forge the name of Lord Tremordyn to a bill of exchange for fifteen hundred pounds . "
176519	176531	176511	176511	I	0	" said Greenwood to himself , when he was again alone . "
176617	176632	176633	176634	A person	3238	" Again the study door opened ; and again did Lafleur make his appearance . "
176645	176650	176636	176636	sir	26649	" said the valet , "
176659	176660	176636	176636	sir	26649	" "
176670	176671	176668	176668	he	3238	" "
176699	176700	176705	176707	such a person	5935	" "
176713	176784	176785	176785	You	0	" Lafleur withdrew , and presently introduced Stephens . For a few moments Greenwood surveyed him in a manner as if he were trying to recollect to whom that pale and altered countenance belonged ; for although Stephens had made considerable improvement in his attire , thanks to the contents of Eliza 's purse , he still retained upon his features the traces of great suffering , mental and bodily . "
176791	176800	176801	176801	Stephens	899	" he said , with a sickly smile . "
176807	176820	176825	176825	I	0	" exclaimed Greenwood , in an accent of the most profound surprise . "
176853	176854	176825	176825	I	0	" "
176864	176865	176860	176860	You	0	" "
176908	176909	176910	176911	Eliza Sydney	902	" "
176913	176917	176910	176911	Eliza Sydney	902	" cried Greenwood . "
176924	176925	176926	176926	She	902	" "
176970	176971	176973	176973	she	902	" "
176982	176987	176973	176973	she	902	" said Greenwood inquiringly . "
177039	177040	177041	177041	I	0	" "
177048	177075	177041	177041	I	0	" said Greenwood , musing upon a scheme which he was revolving in his mind , and which was as yet only a few minutes old : "
177115	177116	177105	177105	you	0	" "
177127	177131	177105	177105	you	0	" said Stephens , "
177141	177142	177105	177105	you	0	" "
177163	177176	177145	177145	you	0	" demanded Greenwood , surveying the returned convict in a peculiar manner . "
177190	177208	177209	177209	We	6401	" answered Stephens , not shrinking from a glance which seemed to penetrate into his very soul . "
177214	177218	177209	177209	We	6401	" said Greenwood . "
177256	177257	177258	177258	You	0	" "
177266	177273	177258	177258	You	0	" observed Stephens , somewhat bitterly . "
177286	177287	177288	177288	I	0	" "
177302	177308	177291	177291	you	0	" said Greenwood , coolly . "
177343	177344	177337	177337	I	0	" "
177351	177355	177356	177357	Eliza Sydney	902	" proceeded Greenwood . "
177359	177366	177356	177357	Eliza Sydney	902	" exclaimed Stephens , in dismay . "
177393	177394	177378	177378	I	0	" "
177397	177401	177378	177378	I	0	" cried Stephens . "
177412	177413	177402	177402	You	0	" "
177417	177426	177402	177402	You	0	" and Mr. Greenwood moved towards the bell . "
177432	177439	177429	177429	you	0	" demanded Stephens , in alarm . "
177452	177458	177459	177459	Villain	1094	" answered Greenwood , coolly . "
177467	177468	177461	177461	you	1094	" "
177474	177486	177469	177469	I	0	" and Greenwood placed his hand upon the bell - rope . "
177498	177502	177505	177505	I	0	" exclaimed Stephens . "
177511	177519	177505	177505	I	0	" Mr. Greenwood returned to his seat . "
177533	177544	177527	177527	you	1094	" he said in his usual calm and measured tone . "
177554	177555	177556	177556	I	0	" "
177564	177565	177560	177560	I	0	" "
177628	177629	177630	177630	I	0	" "
177643	177644	177640	177640	I	0	" "
177687	177688	177668	177668	you	1094	" "
177696	177701	177668	177668	you	1094	" cried Stephens emphatically . "
177727	177728	177729	177729	She	902	" "
177736	177757	177758	177759	My God	27430	" said Greenwood , sinking his voice almost to a whisper , and regarding his companion in a significant manner . "
177765	177776	177758	177759	My God	27430	" ejaculated Stephens , with horror depicted upon his countenance . "
177792	177797	177758	177759	My God	27430	" said Greenwood satirically . "
177804	177856	177857	177857	You	1094	" cried Stephens , striking the palm of his right hand against his forehead . Greenwood approached him , and whispered for some time in his ear . Stephens listened in silence ; and when the libertine had done , he signified a reluctant assent by means of a slight nod . "
177865	177870	177857	177857	You	1094	" said Greenwood aloud . "
177873	178022	178023	178023	You	6412	" answered Stephens . He then took his departure . Scarcely had he left the house when Sir Rupert Harborough returned . The baronet was deadly pale , and trembled violently . Greenwood affected not to observe his emotions , but received the bill of exchange which the baronet handed to him , with as much coolness as if he were concluding a perfectly legitimate transaction . Having read the document , he handed a pen to the baronet to endorse it . Sir Rupert affixed his name at the back of the forged instrument with a species of desperate resolution . Mr. Greenwood consigned the bill to his desk , and then wrote a cheque for a thousand pounds , which he handed to the baronet . Thus terminated this transaction . When the baronet had taken his departure , Mr. Greenwood summoned Lafleur , and said , "
178067	179059	178050	178056	the fellow known as Tom the Cracksman	6413	" Mr. Greenwood having thus concluded his morning 's business , partook of an elegant luncheon , and then proceeded to dress for his afternoon 's ride in the Park . THE more civilization progresses , and the more refined becomes the human intellect , so does human iniquity increase . It is true that heinous and appalling crimes are less frequent;—but every kind of social , domestic , political , and commercial intrigue grows more into vogue : human ingenuity is more continually on the rack to discover the means of defrauding a neighbour or cheating the world;—the sacred name of religion is called in to aid and further the nefarious devices of the schemer;—hypocrisy is the cloak which conceals modern acts of turpitude , as dark nights were trusted to for the concealment of the bloody deeds of old : mere brute force is now less frequently resorted to ; but the refinements of education or the exercise of duplicity are the engines chiefly used for purposes of plunder . The steel engraver 's art , and the skill of the caligrapher , are mighty implements of modern misdeed:—years and years are expended in calculating the chances of cards and dice;—education , manners , and good looks are essential to the formation of the adventurers of the present day;—the Bankruptcy Court itself is a frequent avenue to the temple of fortune;—and , in order to suit this new and refined system of things , the degrees of vices themselves are qualified by different names , so that he who gambles at a gaming - table is a scamp , and he who propagates a lie upon the Exchange and gambles accordingly , and with success , is a respectable financier . Chicanery , upon a small scale , and in a miserable dark office , is a degradation;—but the delicate and elaborate chicanery of politics , by which a statesman is enabled to outwit parties , or deceive whole nations , is a masterpiece of human talent ! To utter a falsehood in private life , to suit a private end , is to cut one's - self off from all honourable society:—but to lie day and night in a public journal — to lie habitually and boldly in print — to lie in a manner the most shameless and barefaced in the editorial columns of a newspaper , is not only admissible , but conventional , and a proof of skill , tact , and talent . Thus is modern society constituted:—let him deny the truth of the picture who can ! London is filled with Mr. Greenwoods : they are to be found in numbers at the West End . Do not for one moment believe , reader , that our portrait of this character is exaggerated . In pursuing the thread of a narrative like this , there will naturally be found much to alarm , to astonish , and to shock : but however appalling the picture , it teaches lessons which none can regret to learn . The chart that would describe the course to virtue must point out and lay bare the shoals , the quicksands , and the rocks of vice which render the passage perilous and full of terrors . With these few remarks , we pursue our history . At seven o'clock in the evening of the day following the one on which we have seen Mr. Greenwood conducting his multifarious schemes and transactions with the precision of a minister of state , Count Alteroni arrived at that gentleman 's house in Spring Gardens . He was shown into the elegantly furnished drawing - room , where Mr. Greenwood received him . The count was , however , the only one of all the financier 's visitors who did not seem dazzled by the proofs of wealth and luxury that prevailed around . The Italian nobleman remarked these indications of great riches , and considered them the guarantees of Mr. Greenwood 's prosperous position in the world : but , apart from this view of the splendour and sumptuousness of the mansion , he neither appeared astonished nor struck with admiration . The truth was , that Mr. Greenwood 's abode , with all its magnificent decorations and ornaments , its costly furniture , and its brilliant display of plate , was a mere hovel compared to the count 's own palace at Montoni , the capital city of Castelcicala . Mr. Greenwood and the count had not exchanged many words , ere dinner was announced . The banquet , although only provided for the founder of the feast and his one guest , was of a most magnificent description , every luxury which London could produce appearing upon the table . At half - past eight o'clock , the clerk of Mr. Greenwood 's solicitor arrived , and was introduced into the dining - room . He had brought with him a deed by which Greenwood bound himself to be answerable to Count Alteroni for the sum of fifteen thousand pounds , which the latter had placed in the hands of the former for the purpose of speculation in a certain Steam - packet Company , Greenwood recognising his responsibility towards the count to the above extent whether the company should succeed or not , it having been originally agreed that he ( Greenwood ) should incur all risks , as he had undertaken the sole direction of the enterprise . This deed was signed by George M. Greenwood , witnessed by the attorney 's clerk , and handed to Count Alteroni . The clerk then withdrew . Mr. Greenwood ordered a bottle of the very best Burgundy to be opened , and drank a bumper to the health of the Signora Isabella . Scarcely was this toast disposed of , when Lafleur entered the room , and said , "
179091	179092	179083	179083	I	0	" "
179096	179107	179083	179083	I	0	" exclaimed Mr. Greenwood , suddenly assuming a business air . "
179120	179121	179109	179109	you	6415	" "
179137	179142	179129	179129	you	6415	" said the nobleman . "
179164	179169	179155	179155	I	0	" cried Mr. Greenwood : "
179185	179267	179177	179177	I	0	" The count suffered himself to be over - ruled ; and Mr. Greenwood repaired to his study , well - knowing that , instead of a courier from Paris , he should there find Tom the Cracksman . Nor was he mistaken . That individual was sitting very comfortably in an arm - chair near the fire , gazing around him , and wondering , amongst other things , where the master of the house kept his strong - box . "
179275	179284	179272	179272	I	0	" said Greenwood , carefully closing the door , "
179289	179290	179286	179287	the Cracksman	3270	" "
179304	179309	179286	179287	the Cracksman	3270	" answered the villain . "
179324	179328	179317	179317	I	0	" continued Greenwood : "
179349	179350	179343	179343	I	0	" "
179360	179374	179357	179358	the sarvice	6424	" demanded the Cracksman , darting a keen and penetrating glance at Greenwood . "
179379	179385	179357	179358	the sarvice	6424	" coolly answered this individual . "
179393	179398	179357	179358	the sarvice	6424	" said the Cracksman . "
179439	179440	179432	179432	yours	6415	" "
179558	179559	179548	179552	the landlord of that place	6429	" "
179571	179576	179577	179578	Another person	6431	" cried the Cracksman . "
179670	179671	179660	179660	he	2618	" "
179774	179775	179761	179761	you	6415	" "
179779	179784	179761	179761	you	6415	" cried the Cracksman . "
179797	179798	179761	179761	you	6415	" "
179808	179809	179800	179800	you	6415	" "
179831	179832	179833	179833	He	6437	" "
179853	179854	179833	179833	He	6437	" "
179863	179870	179833	179833	He	6437	" said the Cracksman , coolly . "
179933	179934	179916	179916	they	6439	" "
179953	179954	179948	179948	they	6439	" "
179971	179972	179962	179963	the Buffer	29668	" "
180117	180118	180119	180119	I	0	" "
180122	180127	180119	180119	I	0	" said the Cracksman . "
180133	180134	180129	180129	he	2368	" "
180140	180141	180129	180129	he	2368	" "
180166	180167	180168	180168	You	0	" "
180186	180187	180168	180168	You	0	" "
180192	180197	180168	180168	You	0	" said the Cracksman . "
180202	180203	180168	180168	You	0	" "
180219	180220	180206	180206	I	0	" "
180236	180237	180227	180227	You	0	" "
180272	180300	180301	180301	My	0	" The Cracksman gave a significant nod and took his departure . Mr. Greenwood returned to the dining - room , where he had left the count . "
180312	180316	180317	180318	My correspondents	6454	" he observed . "
180335	180336	180337	180337	I	0	" "
180349	180543	180337	180337	I	0	" said the count . The two gentlemen then broached another bottle of Burgundy ; and Mr. Greenwood conversed with even more sprightliness than usual . Indeed , the count fancied that he had never found his host so agreeable and entertaining . At eleven o'clock precisely , the count 's cabriolet was announced ; and the nobleman took his departure , with the conviction , that , under his present circumstances , Mr. Greenwood was the most eligible suitor for the hand of Isabella that was likely to present himself . As soon as the count had taken his departure , Mr. Greenwood rang for his slippers and dressing - gown , drew close to the cheerful fire that burnt in the grate , and ordered Lafleur to make him a tumbler of the best pine - apple rum - punch . This exhilarating beverage and a fragrant Havannah cigar enabled Mr. Greenwood to pass the time away in a most comfortable and soul - soothing manner . And it was thus that he mused as he watched the pale blue transparent smoke of his cigar wreathing upwards to the ceiling : — "
180876	180903	180904	180904	I	0	" Lafleur entered the room at this moment , and handed a letter to his master . Greenwood opened it , and read as follows : — "
181017	181195	181008	181008	You	6474	" Greenwood full well understood the meaning of this note without a signature ; and its contents tended to augment that happiness which the success of his schemes infused into his breast . Hour after hour passed away;—at length midnight sounded ; and all the servants , save Lafleur , were dismissed to their sleeping apartments . The cigars , the rum - punch , and the pleasurable reflections into which the financier plunged , made the time elapse rapidly . One o'clock struck ; and he had not found a single moment tedious . He was not anxious , nor a prey to suspense , as other men would have been ; he felt certain that his wishes would be accomplished , and he was therefore as composed as if he had already been assured of their success . The clock struck two ; and a low knock was heard at the front door . Lafleur answered the summons ; and in a few moments introduced the Cracksman to the room where his master was sitting . "
181201	181212	181008	181008	You	6474	" said that worthy , the moment Lafleur had withdrawn . "
181220	181224	181217	181217	I	0	" cried Greenwood . "
181229	181234	181235	181235	We	6478	" returned the Cracksman . "
181301	181302	181289	181289	myself	0	" "
181310	181322	181303	181303	You	0	" said Greenwood , his whole countenance suddenly convulsed with horror . "
181341	181348	181333	181333	you	0	" returned the Cracksman , coolly . "
181376	181425	181426	181426	You	0	" Mr. Greenwood received the papers from the hands of the Cracksman , and observed with a glance that amongst them was the document which he had given a few hours previously to guarantee the safety of the fifteen thousand pounds placed in his hands by Count Alteroni . "
181430	181442	181426	181426	You	0	" he said , with some uneasiness depicted upon his countenance , "
181456	181457	181426	181426	You	0	" "
181464	181469	181470	181470	I	0	" cried the Cracksman ; "
181513	181514	181507	181507	I	0	" "
181526	181550	181519	181519	you	0	" said Greenwood;—then , taking his purse from his pocket , he counted down forty - two sovereigns upon the table , adding , "
181560	181579	181519	181519	you	0	" The Cracksman consigned the money to his fob , and then took leave of his employer , hoping "
181589	181747	181748	181748	My	0	" The moment he was gone , Greenwood thrust the document , which he had thus got back by a crime of an infamous nature , into the fire . When it was completely consumed , he proceeded to examine the other papers . These consisted chiefly of letters written in cypher , addressed to Count Alteroni , and bearing the post - mark of Montoni , Castelcicala : the rest were notes and memoranda of no consequence whatever . Mr. Greenwood , being unable to unriddle the letters written in cypher , and considering that they were upon political subjects with which he had little or no interest , consigned the entire packet of papers to the flames . He then retired to rest , and slept as soundly as if his entire day had been passed in virtuous deeds . At about ten o'clock in the morning he received the following letter from Richmond : — "
181753	181861	181750	181751	Mr. Greenwood	903	" As I was on my way home last evening , I was suddenly attacked by three villains in a dark and lonely part of the road . One of the miscreants stunned me with the blow of a pistol , and threw the little jockey into a ditch . Fortunately we are neither of us seriously injured . The robbers plundered me of every thing I had about my person — my purse containing thirty - four sovereigns , and all my papers , amongst which was the security I had received from your hands a few hours before . You will perhaps have another drawn . "
181900	181904	181905	181905	ALTERONI	1047	" Yours faithfully , "
181907	181908	181905	181905	ALTERONI	1047	" "
181920	181932	181933	181933	He	6487	" exclaimed Mr. Greenwood , when he had perused this letter . "
182107	182117	182070	182070	I	0	" he added , in a tone of triumph , "
182143	182482	182483	182483	You	6493	" RETURN we once more to the villa at Upper Clapton . Eliza Sydney 's household consisted only of Louisa and a peasant girl of about fifteen . She no longer kept horses and dogs , as she was compelled by Stephens to do during the time of her disguise , previously to her imprisonment . She therefore required no male retainers , save an old gardener who lived in one of the out - houses . A fictitious letter had caused the faithful Louisa to set out on a long journey ; and thus the principal obstacle to the atrocious scheme of the conspirators against Eliza 's peace and honour was removed . At ten o'clock on the evening fixed for the perpetration of the foul deed , the servant - girl carried the supper - tray to the dining - room where Eliza and Stephens were seated . The domestic spread the table with the materials for the most sociable of all meals , and , having placed two decanters upon the hospitable board , withdrew . The countenance of Stephens was particularly calm , considering the part he had undertaken to play towards a woman whose loveliness alone was sufficient to disarm the hand of enmity , and obtain the friendship of the most lawless . She had , moreover , already suffered so much through him,—she had extended towards him the hand of forgiveness and succour in his dire need,—and she possessed the most generous , the most noble , and the most confiding of dispositions . Oh ! should not all these considerations have moved that man in her favour ? He had received from Eliza the hundred pounds which she had promised him . With that sum he might have found his way to America , and still had a considerable balance in his pocket . But he had determined to add to it the two hundred pounds more which Greenwood had promised him . Although calm , he was very thoughtful . "
182487	182499	182483	182483	You	6493	" said Eliza , observing the pensive air of her guest . "
182519	182520	182501	182501	you	6493	" "
182556	182557	182544	182544	I	0	" "
182577	182581	182587	182587	we	6497	" continued Eliza , "
182701	182702	182703	182703	You	6493	" "
182713	182717	182703	182703	You	6493	" said Stephens . "
182721	182725	182703	182703	You	6493	" answered Eliza , "
182880	182881	182884	182884	you	6493	" "
182900	182901	182884	182884	you	6493	" "
182969	182970	182977	182977	you	6516	" "
182989	182993	182980	182980	you	6516	" said Stephens . "
183005	183023	182980	182980	you	6516	" Stephens filled two glasses with Port wine ; and almost at the same moment he exclaimed , "
183034	183059	182980	182980	you	6516	" Then , in a feigned attempt to raise the wick , he turned the screw the wrong way , and extinguished the light . "
183065	183118	182980	182980	you	6516	" he cried ; and , while Eliza hastened to re - light the lamp , he poured a few drops from a phial into one of the glasses of wine . The lamp was lighted once more ; and Eliza had resumed her seat . Stephens handed her the fatal glass . "
183127	183131	182980	182980	you	6516	" he said : "
183143	183158	183134	183134	God	880	" The words did not stick in his throat as he gave them utterance . "
183167	183245	183134	183134	God	880	" exclaimed Eliza in a tone which proved that the wish came from the bottom of her heart . She then drank a portion of the wine in her glass . The countenance of Stephens did not change as Eliza imbibed the soporific fluid . He contemplated her beauteous face with as much calmness as if he had just administered to her a potion calculated to embellish her charms , and add to her health and happiness . "
183252	183266	183247	183247	my	0	" said Eliza , placing the half - emptied glass upon the table ; "
183279	183280	183274	183274	I	0	" "
183287	183291	183274	183274	I	0	" returned Stephens . "
183304	183308	183297	183297	I	0	" observed Eliza . "
183318	183319	183297	183297	I	0	" "
183347	183351	183333	183333	you	0	" said Stephens . "
183356	183364	183333	183333	you	0	" answered Eliza , with a smile , "
183372	183438	183365	183365	I	0	" and she drained her glass . Half an hour passed in conversation ; and Eliza felt an irresistible drowsiness coming over her . She endeavoured to rally against it — but in vain ; and at length she would have fallen from her chair fast asleep , had not Stephens rushed forward and caught her . He then rang the bell for the servant . "
183475	183616	183462	183462	I	0	" Stephens and the servant carried the entranced lady to the boudoir . Having placed her upon the bed , Stephens left the servant to undress her , and hastily descended to the hall . He opened the front door with caution , and whistled . Two men emerged from the total darkness without , and glided into the hall . Stephens conducted them into a back parlour , and gave them the key to lock themselves in . He himself then returned to the dining - room , where he tranquilly awaited the arrival of Mr. Greenwood . Midnight was proclaimed at length . A low knock at the front door fell upon Stephens 's ear . He hastened to obey the summons , and admitted Greenwood into the house . They repaired to the dining - room together . "
183626	183630	183631	183631	Eliza	902	" said Stephens . "
183672	183700	183701	183701	You	6522	" And yet this man did not seem appalled nor horror - struck at the infernal nature of the crime for which he thus demanded the recompense . "
183709	183739	183701	183701	You	6522	" said Greenwood ; and he left the room . At the expiration of that interval he returned , the fire of triumph and lust flashing from his eyes . "
183751	183762	183745	183745	you	6522	" he observed in a tone of joy and exultation ; "
183830	183918	183921	183921	she	902	" Greenwood handed a bank - note to his accomplice — or rather instrument in this atrocious proceeding ; and Stephens then took his departure . But as he passed through the hall , he thrust a letter , addressed to Eliza Sydney , beneath the carpet that covered the stairs . The moment Greenwood was alone , he paced the dining - room for a few minutes , to feast his imagination with the pleasures of love and triumph which he now beheld within his reach . "
183925	183929	183921	183921	she	902	" he said : "
184069	184089	184042	184042	her	902	" He paused ; filled a tumbler half full of wine — and drank the contents at a draught . "
184103	184107	184042	184042	her	902	" he resumed . "
184166	184264	184265	184266	The deuce	26530	" With these words , he left the dining - room , and crossed the hall towards the staircase . He was now about to ascend to the boudoir . His foot was upon the first step , when he was rudely seized from behind , and instantly gagged with a pocket - handkerchief . Turning his head partially round , in a vain effort to escape from the powerful grasp in which he found himself , he encountered , by the light of the lamp that hung in the hall , the glance of the Cracksman . "
184268	184279	184265	184266	The deuce	26530	" exclaimed the burglar in a low and subdued tone : "
184345	184346	184323	184323	your	26530	" "
184356	184372	184373	184373	you	954	" said the Cracksman 's companion , who was no other than the Resurrection Man : "
184385	184386	184373	184373	you	954	" "
184404	184409	184387	184387	He	27255	" answered the Cracksman . "
184418	184425	184411	184411	he	27255	" added the Resurrection Man significantly . "
184447	184448	184437	184437	Stephens	899	" "
184458	184463	184452	184452	we	6532	" returned the Cracksman : "
184478	184711	184468	184468	I	0	" Greenwood conveyed several intimations , by means of signs , that he wished to speak ; but the two ruffians hurried him out of the house . They conducted him across the fields to an empty barn at a distance of about a mile from the villa . During the journey thither they conversed together in a flash language altogether unintelligible to their captive , who was still gagged . A difference of opinion evidently seemed to subsist between the two men , relative to the plan which they should pursue with regard to Greenwood ; but they at length appeared to agree upon the point . With regard to Greenwood himself , he was a prey to a variety of painful feelings,—disappointment in his designs upon Eliza at the moment when he appeared to stand upon the threshhold of success,—bitter malignity against Stephens who had thus duped him,—and alarm at the uncertainty of the fate which might await him at the hands of the villains in whose power he thus strangely found himself . The night was pitch - dark ; but the moment the two ruffians with their captive entered the barn , a lantern in the hands of the Cracksman was suddenly made to throw a bright light forwards . That light fell upon the countenance of Stephens , who was standing in the middle of the shed . "
184715	184720	184721	184721	We	6535	" said the Cracksman . "
184738	184739	184729	184729	he	6536	" "
184750	184754	184746	184746	you	6538	" demanded Stephens . "
184762	184767	184746	184746	you	6538	" replied the Cracksman . "
184825	184826	184811	184811	your	6538	" "
184831	184835	184811	184811	your	6538	" said Stephens . "
184842	184878	184811	184811	your	6538	" The Cracksman and the Resurrection Man instantly obeyed this command : they threw Greenwood upon a truss of straw , and fastened his hands together , and then his feet , with strong cord . "
184884	184895	184881	184881	your	6538	" said Stephens , as soon as this was accomplished . "
184906	184943	184896	184896	I	0	" He handed them some money as he thus spoke ; and , having counted it , the two villains bade him good night and left the barn , which was now enveloped in total darkness . "
184947	184961	184896	184896	I	0	" said Stephens , as soon as he was alone with his prisoner , "
185241	185450	185453	185453	sir	26649	" Stephens ceased ; and taking a long rope from a comer of the barn where he had concealed it , he fastened it to the cord which already confined the hands and feet of Greenwood . He then attached the ends firmly to one of the upright beams of the barn , so as to prevent the captive from crawling away from the place . This precaution being adopted , Stephens took his departure . It would be impossible to describe the rage , vexation , and disappointment which filled the breast of Greenwood while Stephens addressed him in the manner described , and then bound him with the cord . Yet during this latter process he lay perfectly quiet — well aware that any attempt at escape on his part would at that moment be totally unavailing . Five minutes elapsed after Stephens had left the barn , and Greenwood was marvelling within himself how long he should have to remain in that unpleasant position — bound with cords , and gagged in such a way that he could only breathe through his nostrils,—when the sounds of footsteps fell upon his ear , and the light of the Cracksman 's lantern again flashed through the barn .

186081	187027	186079	186079	sir	26649	" Greenwood arose from the straw upon which he had been lying , and stretched his limbs with as much pleasure as if he had just recovered from a severe cramp . He then reiterated his promise to the two men relative to the reward to be paid for the service just rendered him ; and , having inquired of them which was the nearest way to the West End , he set out upon his long and lonely walk home , depressed , disappointed , and hesitating between plans of vengeance against Stephens and fears of exposure in his own vile and defeated machinations with regard to the beautiful Eliza Sydney . ON the morning following the events just narrated , Mrs. Arlington was seated at breakfast in a sweet little parlour of the splendid mansion which the Earl of Warrington had taken and fitted up for her in Dover Street , Piccadilly . It was about eleven o'clock ; and the Enchantress was attired in a delicious deshabillé . With her little feet upon an ottoman near the fender , and her fine form reclining in a luxurious large arm - chair , she divided her attention between her chocolate and the columns of the Morning Herald . She invariably prolonged the morning 's repast as much as possible , simply because it served to wile away the time until the hour for dressing arrived . Then visits received , filled up the interval till three or four o'clock , when the carriage came round to the door . A drive in the park , or shopping ( according to the state of the weather ) occupied the time until six or seven . Then another toilet in preparation for dinner . In the evening a tête - à - tête with the Earl of Warrington , who had , perhaps , arrived in time for dinner,—or a visit to a theatre , the Opera , or a concert,—and to bed at midnight , or frequently much later . Such was the routine of the Enchantress 's existence . The Earl of Warrington behaved most liberally towards her . On the first day of every month he enclosed her a cheque upon his banker for two hundred guineas . He supplied her cellar with wine , and frequently made her the most splendid presents of jewellery , plate , cachmeres , & c. The furniture for her mansion had cost fifteen hundred pounds ; and all the bills were paid in her name . She was not extravagant , as women in her situation usually are ; and therefore , so far from incurring debts , she saved money . We can not say that the Earl of Warrington positively loved her . His first affections in life had experienced such a blight , that they might almost be said to have been interred in the grave of defeated hopes and aspirations . He could therefore never love again . But he liked Mrs. Arlington ; and he had every reason to believe that she was faithful to him . He was charmed with her conversation and her manners : he saw in her a woman who gave herself no airs , but , on the contrary , exerted herself in every way to please him;—she never attempted to excite his jealousy , nor affected gusts of passion merely for the sake of asserting her independence or of proving the hold which she possessed over him;—and in her society he forgot the cares of politics ( in which he was profoundly interested ) and all those other little annoyances , real or imaginary , to which every one in this world is subject , be his condition never so prosperous ! And Diana was faithful to him . She was a woman naturally inclined to virtue:—circumstances had made her what she was . She looked upon the Earl of Warrington as a benefactor ; and , although she did not actually love him more than he loved her , she liked him upon pretty nearly the same principles that he liked her . Her vanity was flattered by having captivated and being able to retain a handsome man , whose wealth and high rank rendered him an object of desire on the part of all ladies situated as was Diana;—she moreover found him an agreeable companion , kind , and indulgent;—and thus their liaison continued upon a basis which nothing appeared to threaten , nor even to weaken . They never spoke of love in reference to their connection . The earl was never upon his knees at the feet of his mistress ; nor did he repeat vows of constancy and fidelity every time he saw her . She acted on the same principle towards him . There was a great amount of real friendship and good feeling between those two;—but not an atom of mawkish sentimentality . The earl could trust Diana : he consulted her upon many of his plans and proceedings , whether in regard to his political career or the management of his estate ; and she invariably tendered him the advice which appeared most consistent with his interests . He therefore placed the fullest confidence in her;—and hence have we seen her carrying out all his generous plans with reference to Eliza Sydney . But to continue . Mrs. Arlington was seated at breakfast , as we have before stated , when a servant entered and informed her that Miss Sydney requested a few minutes ' conversation with her . Diana immediately ordered Eliza to be admitted . "
187039	187055	187056	187056	I	0	" said Eliza , affectionately grasping the hand that was stretched out to welcome her . "
187066	187071	187064	187064	Eliza	902	" answered the Enchantress . "
187102	187103	187104	187104	My	0	" "
187108	187112	187104	187104	My	0	" continued Eliza , "

187176	187242	187135	187135	you	26713	" With these words , Eliza handed to Mrs. Arlington the letter which Stephens had thrust under the stair - carpet at the villa on the preceding evening . Diana perused the letter with attention ; and a flash of indignation animated her fine countenance , as she thus made herself acquainted with the atrocious plot contrived by Greenwood against the honour of Eliza Sydney . "
187251	187264	187248	187249	George Montague	903	" cried Diana at the termination of the perusal of that letter . "
187271	187286	187248	187249	George Montague	903	" said Eliza , taking the hand of Mrs. Arlington and pressing it between her own;—"forgive

187315	187322	187325	187325	Diana	889	" exclaimed Mrs. Arlington in surprise . "

187681	187693	187655	187655	Diana	889	" replied Mrs. Arlington , after a few minutes ' consideration , "
187706	187707	187655	187655	Diana	889	" "
187719	187724	187655	187655	Diana	889	" said Miss Sydney . "
187744	187745	187746	187746	You	6579	" "
187753	187758	187746	187746	You	6579	" observed Mrs. Arlington . "

187899	187903	187905	187905	he	4112	" interrupted Eliza ; "
187921	187984	187985	187988	The Earl of Warrington	28357	" Mrs. Arlington dispatched the note to Lord Warrington , and then hastened to dress to receive him . In an hour the earl arrived . He and Mrs. Arlington were then closeted together for a considerable time . It was four o'clock when the nobleman took his departure , and Diana returned to the room where she had left Eliza Sydney . "
187990	188002	187985	187988	The Earl of Warrington	28357	" said the Enchantress , whose countenance was animated with joy , "
188126	188127	188114	188114	he	4112	" "
188134	188146	188131	188132	his lordship	3013	" exclaimed Eliza , tears of gratitude starting into her eyes . "
188151	188155	188156	188157	the earl	4112	" continued Diana , "
188340	188341	188322	188323	His lordship	3013	" "

188367	188381	188382	188383	The earl	4112	" interrupted Mrs. Arlington , playfully closing Eliza 's lips with her hand . "

188523	188527	188483	188483	His	4112	" said Eliza , "

188562	188567	188544	188544	his	4112	" exclaimed Mrs. Arlington . "
188623	188628	188615	188615	himself	4112	" added Mrs. Arlington , "
188642	188643	188615	188615	himself	4112	" "
188656	188668	188615	188615	himself	4112	" cried Eliza , embracing Diana with the most grateful fervour . "
188695	188696	188682	188682	I	0	" "
188711	188722	188699	188699	you	6612	" said Mrs. Arlington , in a tone deeply affected . "
188730	188744	188699	188699	you	6612	" exclaimed Miss Sydney , as if she repelled the idea with indignation : "
188774	188775	188776	188776	We	6640	" "
188789	188800	188776	188776	We	6640	" said Diana , warmly returning her friend 's embrace ; "
188827	188839	188776	188776	We	6640	" Mrs. Arlington gave directions to her servants that she was not "
188842	189025	189026	189027	The Lord	27089	" to a soul , save the Earl of Warrington ; and the ride in the park — the shopping — the theatre in the evening — all were sacrificed by Diana to the pleasure of Eliza 's society . Miss Sydney dispatched a note to the villa at Upper Clapton , announcing her intention of staying a few days with Mrs. Arlington . In the evening , Louisa , who had just returned from the journey on which the fictitious letter written by Stephens had sent her , made her appearance in Dover Street , with clothes , & c. for her mistress , and she then received instructions relative to the intended departure for the Continent . RETURN we to the dwelling of Richard Markham on the same day that Eliza Sydney sought her friend Mrs. Arlington , as related in the preceding chapter . Richard awoke as from a long and painful dream . He opened his eyes , and gazed vacantly around him . He was in his own bed , and Whittingham was seated by his side . "
189031	189069	189026	189027	The Lord	27089	" ejaculated the faithful old domestic;—and conceiving it necessary to quote Scripture upon the occasion of this happy recovery , he uttered , in a loud and solemn voice , the first sentence which presented itself to his memory,—"My
189079	189080	189075	189077	a ready writer	6647	" "
189090	189100	189088	189088	Whittingham	881	" demanded our hero , in a faint tone . "
189115	189120	189112	189113	Master Richard	874	" was the reply ; "
189184	189185	189168	189168	I	0	" "
189201	189213	189197	189199	my good friend	29199	" said Richard , pressing the faithful old domestic 's hand . "

189227	189231	189197	189199	my good friend	29199	" exclaimed Whittingham ; "

189322	189323	189298	189298	I	0	" "
189334	189339	189325	189325	you	0	" interrupted the butler ; "

189405	189409	189397	189397	I	0	" cried Markham . "
189425	189438	189413	189413	you	0	" said the butler , with a solemn shake of the head . "
189457	189458	189459	189459	I	0	" "
189470	189484	189459	189459	I	0	" resumed Whittingham , preparing to enumerate the various incidents upon his fingers . "

189684	189700	189681	189681	My	0	" exclaimed Richard , whose countenance was now suddenly animated with a ray of hope : "
189707	189708	189703	189703	you	0	" "
189719	189720	189712	189712	I	0	" "
189743	189748	189712	189712	I	0	" said Markham hastily . "
189771	190165	190166	190166	My	0	" While Richard uttered these words with a considerable degree of impatience , the butler dragged the portmanteau from beneath the bed , where he had deposited it , and placed it close to his master 's right hand . It was speedily opened , unpacked , and examined throughout ; the clothes and linen were unfolded ; and Richard 's eyes followed the investigation with the most painful curiosity . But there was no letter — no note from any inmate of the count 's abode . A sudden reminiscence entered his mind . Was the document signed at the Dark House amongst his papers ? He recollected having handed it to the count ; but he could not call to mind what had afterwards become of it . A moment 's examination convinced him that it had not been returned to him . At first he was grievously annoyed by this circumstance;—in another minute he was pleased , for it struck him that , after all , its contents might have been perused by the count and his family when the excitement of that fatal night had worn off . But how to wipe away the dread suspicion raised by the Resurrection Man , relative to the burglary — oh ! that was the most painful , and yet the most necessary task of all ! Markham sank back upon his pillow , and was lost in thought , when a low knock was heard at the door of his chamber . Whittingham answered it , and introduced Mr. Monroe . The old man was the very picture of care and wretchedness:—the mark of famine was , moreover , upon his sunken cheeks . His eyes were dead and lustreless;—his neck , his wrists , and his hands seemed nothing but skin and bone . In spite of the cleanliness of his person , the thread - bare shabbiness of his clothes could not escape the eye of even the most superficial observer . Markham had not seen him for some months ; and now , forgetting his own malady and his own cares , he felt shocked at the dreadful alteration wrought upon the old man 's person during that interval . On his part , Mr. Monroe was not less surprised to find Richard upon a bed of sickness . "
190170	190174	190166	190166	My	0	" said Markham , "
190192	190193	190184	190184	you	26679	" "
190204	190211	190196	190196	you	26679	" exclaimed the old man bitterly . "

190270	190271	190259	190259	I	0	" "
190281	190291	190274	190274	I	0	" interrupted the old man , bursting into tears , "

190309	190313	190304	190304	you	874	" said Markham : "

190343	190350	190304	190304	you	874	" cried the old man fervently . "
190371	190372	190363	190363	you	874	" "

190525	190545	190516	190517	Mr. Monroe	885	" cried Richard , horror - struck at the piteous tale thus conveyed to him in a few words . "
190552	190581	190516	190517	Mr. Monroe	885	" answered the old man , sinking into a chair , and sobbing bitterly . Whittingham walked towards the window , and wiped his eyes more than once . "
190595	190599	190584	190584	I	0	" said Markham . "
190641	190642	190643	190643	He	6679	" "
190655	190659	190643	190643	He	6679	" observed Monroe . "
190723	190724	190715	190715	he	6679	" "
190729	190733	190715	190715	he	6679	" ejaculated Markham . "
190742	190743	190744	190744	Greenwood	903	" "
190746	190751	190752	190752	Greenwood	903	" answered Mr. Monroe . "
190764	190786	190760	190762	the same person	6684	" cried Richard , suddenly recalling to mind the name of the individual to whom the count had entrusted his capital . "
190835	191015	191016	191016	Madam	26758	" While Whittingham was arranging his master 's portfolio upon the coverlid of the bed , Markham reflected upon the best means of communicating to Count Alteroni the character of the man to whom he had confided his fortune , and whom he thought of favourably as a suitor for his daughter 's hand . Anonymous letters were detestable to the honourable and open disposition of Richard , and he hesitated at the idea of sending a note direct from himself , fearing that it might be thrown into the fire the moment its signature should be perceived , and thus fail in its proposed aim . To call upon the count was impossible : to send Mr. Monroe was disagreeable . To communicate the important intelligence was imperiously necessary . But how was it to be conveyed ? An idea struck across his brain in this perplexity:—he would write to the countess , and trust to the natural curiosity of the female disposition to ensure the perusal of his letter . He accordingly penned the ensuing epistle : — "
191018	191209	191016	191016	Madam	26758	" Although calumniated in the presence of Count Alteroni , without being permitted to justify myself ; and although ruined in your estimation , without the freedom of explanation,—believe me , I have still the welfare of your family most sincerely at heart . As a proof of this assertion , allow me to inform you that the Mr. Greenwood , to whom Count Alteroni has entrusted his capital , is an adventurer and a villain . I on several occasions casually mentioned to you that I was plundered of all my property , before I became of an age entitled to enjoy it . My guardian Mr. Monroe , employed a certain Mr. Allen to speculate for him ; and this Mr. Allen was mercilessly robbed of all he possessed , and all he could raise , and all his friends who backed him could provide him with , by a miscreant of the name of Montague . These particulars , which I never mentioned to you before , I now deem it requisite to acquaint you with . Madam , that same George Montague is your Mr. Greenwood ! "
191219	191223	191213	191213	Madam	26758	" RICHARD MARKHAM . "
191388	191394	191396	191397	the count	26666	" Isabel , my love , "
191399	191451	191396	191397	the count	26666	" you are thoughtful this evening . What a silly girl you are to oppose that tyrannical little will of your own to my anxious hopes and wishes for your welfare — especially as I must know so much better than you what is for your good and what is not . "
191452	191456	191458	191458	Isabella	1066	" I think , "
191465	191478	191458	191458	Isabella	1066	" that I oppose no tyrannical will to your lordship 's commands . "
191479	191484	191486	191487	the count	26666	" Lordship 's commands ! "
191492	191516	191518	191519	the nobleman	3005	" Have I not ordered our rank and station to be forgotten here — in England ? And as for commands , Bella , "
191523	191562	191518	191519	the nobleman	3005	" I have merely expressed my wish that you should give Mr. Greenwood an opportunity of proving his disinterested affection and securing your esteem — especially on the occasion of our approaching visit to our friends the Tremordyns . "
191563	191568	191570	191571	the signora	5333	" My dear papa , "
191573	191598	191570	191571	the signora	5333	" I have faithfully promised you that if Mr. Greenwood should gain my affections , he shall not sue in vain for my hand . "
191599	191612	191614	191615	the count	26666	" That is a species of compromise which I do not understand , "
191617	191626	191614	191615	the count	26666	" Have you any particular aversion to him ? "
191627	191640	191642	191642	Isabella	1066	" I have no aversion — but I certainly have no love , "
191645	191664	191642	191642	Isabella	1066	" and where there is not love , dear father , you would not have me we d ? "
191665	191672	191674	191675	the count	26666	" Oh ! as for love , "
191685	191712	191674	191675	the count	26666	" time invariably thaws away those stern resolves and objections which young ladies sometimes choose to entertain , in opposition to the wishes of their parents . "
191713	191724	191726	191726	Isabella	1066	" My lord , I have no power over volition , "
191734	191744	191746	191747	the count	26666	" This is very provoking , Isabella — very ! "
191755	191809	191746	191747	the count	26666	" This man is in every way worthy of you — rich , genteel , and good - looking . As for his rank — it is true that he has no title : but of what avail to us are rank and title — exiled as we are from our native land — "
191810	191817	191819	191819	Isabella	1066	" Oh ! my dear father ! "
191825	191888	191819	191819	Isabella	1066	" do not fancy so ill of me as to suppose that I languish for rank , or care for honour ! No — let me either possess that title which is a reflection of your own when in Castelcicala;—or let me be plain Signora Isabella in a foreign land . Pomp and banishment — pride and exile , are monstrous incongruities ! "
191889	191899	191901	191902	the count	26666	" That is spoken like my own dear daughter , "
191904	191970	191901	191902	the count	26666	" The sorrows of my own lot are mitigated by the philosophy and firmness with which you and your dear mother support our change of fortunes;—and , alas ! I see but little chance of another re - action in our favour . O my dear country ! shall I ever see thee more ? Wilt thou one day recognise those who really love thee ? "
192001	192014	192016	192017	the nobleman	3005	" And it is this despair when I contemplate my future prospects , "
192024	192053	192016	192017	the nobleman	3005	" that induces me to wish to see you speedily settled and provided for , my dearest Isabella . What other motive can I have but your good ? "
192054	192069	192071	192073	the charming girl	6705	" Oh ! I know it — I know it , my dear father , "
192075	192139	192071	192073	the charming girl	6705	" and it is that conviction which makes me wretched when I think how reluctant I am to obey you in this instance . But do not grieve yourself , my dear father — and do not be angry with me ! I will be as civil and friendly as I can to this Mr. Greenwood ; and if — and if — — "
192263	192269	192270	192270	he	26666	" Bella , my darling , "
192273	192316	192270	192270	he	26666	" do not give way to grief : you can not think that I would sacrifice you to gold — mere gold ? No — never , never ! Console yourself — you shall never be dragged a victim to the altar ! "
192317	192322	192324	192324	Isabella	1066	" My dearest father , "
192333	192406	192270	192270	he	26666	fondly,—"God , who reads all my actions , knows that I would make any sacrifice to please you — to spare you one pang — to forward your views ! Oh ! believe me , I am too well aware of the deep responsibility under which I exist towards my parents — too deeply imbued with gratitude for all your kindness towards me , not to be prepared to obey your wishes ! "
192407	192417	192419	192420	the count	26666	" I will exact no sacrifice , dearest girl , "
192422	192431	192419	192420	the count	26666	" Compose yourself — and do not weep ! "
192465	192473	192475	192476	the financier	30425	" Ladies , excuse this late visit , "
192491	192525	192483	192483	his	30425	" but the truth is , I had business in the neighbourhood , and I could not possibly pass without stopping for a few moments at a mansion where there are such attractions . "
192546	192549	192551	192552	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Count , "
192560	192586	192551	192552	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I have not seen you since your adventure upon the highway ! But I was delighted to learn that you had received no injury . "
192587	192600	192602	192603	the count	26666	" My only regret is that I did not shoot the villains , "
192605	192624	192602	192603	the count	26666	" Have you had another deed prepared , to replace the one stolen from me on that occasion ? "
192625	192635	192637	192637	Greenwood	903	" I have given my solicitors the necessary instructions , "
192639	192646	192637	192637	Greenwood	903	" In a few days — — "
192647	192660	192662	192663	the count	26666	" Every thing with you is in a few days , Greenwood , "
192668	192703	192662	192663	the count	26666	" That deed would not occupy one day to engross , now that the copy is at your attorney 's office ; and it would have been a mark of goodwill on your part — "
192704	192711	192713	192714	the financier	30425	" Pray do not blame me ! "
192735	192774	192790	192791	the nobleman	3005	" I believe that for a man who has so much business upon his hands , and the interests of so many to watch and care for , I am as punctual to my appointments as most people . "
192775	192788	192790	192791	the nobleman	3005	" I do not speak of want of punctuality in keeping appointments , "
192793	192818	192790	192791	the nobleman	3005	" but I allude to the neglect of a matter which to you may appear trivial , but which to me is of importance . "
192819	192844	192846	192847	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Oh ! my dear count — we will repair this little error the day after to - morrow — or the next day , "
192849	192909	192910	192910	he	903	" I wish that every body was as regular and as punctual with me , as I endeavour to be with others ; and that punctuality on my part , my dear sir , has been the origin of my fortune . I do not like to speak of myself , ladies — I hate egotism — but really , "
192916	192926	192910	192910	he	903	" when one is attacked , you know — — "
192959	192964	192930	192931	a domestic	28911	" From Richard Markham ! "
192965	192969	192971	192972	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Richard Markham ! "
192974	192992	192971	192972	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I thought I understood you that that gentleman had ceased to visit or correspond with you ? "
192993	193004	193006	193007	the count	26666	" So I said — and so I shall maintain ! "
193009	193022	193006	193007	the count	26666	" My dear , we will return that letter without reading it . "
193023	193034	193036	193037	the countess	5273	" But I have already commenced the perusal of it , "
193047	193051	193036	193037	the countess	5273	" and — — "
193052	193058	193060	193061	the count	26666	" Then read no more , "
193065	193075	193077	193078	the countess	5273	" Excuse me — I shall read it all , "
193081	193087	193077	193078	the countess	5273	" and so will you . "
193088	193093	193095	193096	the count	26666	" What means this ? "
193098	193116	193095	193096	the count	26666	" Have I lost all authority in my own house ? Madam , I command you — — "
193117	193173	193174	193175	The count	26666	" There — I have finished it , and I implore you to read it yourself . Its contents are highly important , and do not in any way relate to certain recent events . Indeed he has purposely avoided any thing which may appear obtrusive , either in the shape of explanation or apology . "
193351	193369	193346	193347	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Pray , sir , how long is it since you were acquainted with one George Montague ? "
193415	193509	193403	193403	his	26666	" Oh ! my dear sir , I presume you are acquainted with the fact that my name was once Montague , since you ask me that question . I may also suppose that some one has communicated that circumstance to you with a desire to prejudice me in your opinion ; but I can assure you that I have not changed my name for any sinister purpose . My only motive was the request of an old lady , who left me a considerable property some time ago , upon that condition . "
193510	193530	193532	193533	the count	26666	" And you can also explain , perhaps , the nature of your dealings with a certain Mr. Allen ? "
193557	193562	193564	193565	the financier	30425	" My dear sir , "
193580	193697	193564	193565	the financier	30425	" I can explain that and every other action of my life . I was myself misled — I was duped — I was involved in an enterprise which entailed ruin upon myself and all connected with me . I suffered along with the others , and gave up all to the creditors . I have , however , been enabled to build up my fortunes again by means of the property left to me , and a series of successful operations . All people in commercial and financial affairs are liable to disappointment and embarrassment : the most cautious may over - speculate or miscalculate ; and how can I be blamed more than another ? "
193698	193709	193711	193712	the count	26666	" I will admit that a particular enterprise may fail , "
193714	193773	193711	193712	the count	26666	" but the writer of this letter explained to me on one or two occasions , enough to enable me to comprehend the whole machinery of fraud which you put into motion to obtain money from the public ; and though he never mentioned any names until to - day , in his letter , I might — — "
193774	193781	193783	193784	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Every man has his enemies , "
193788	193826	193783	193784	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I can not hope to be without mine . They may assert what they choose : upright and impartial men never listen to one - sided statements . But perhaps the writer of that letter — — "
193827	193857	193859	193860	the count	26666	" He is the Mr. Markham of whom I have often spoken to you , and concerning whom you were always asking me questions . I could not conceive , "
193862	193919	193859	193860	the count	26666	" why you were so curious to pry into his affairs , especially as when I mentioned you to him by the name of Greenwood , he did not seem to know any thing about you . But I can now well understand why you should wish to know something of a man whom you ruined ! "
193920	193924	193926	193927	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I ruined ! "
193951	193982	193926	193927	Mr. Greenwood	903	" There must be some mistake in this ! I never had any dealings with him in my life , which could either cause his ruin or establish his prosperity . "
193983	194000	194002	194003	the count	26666	" You took very good care , it would appear , not to do the latter , "
194005	194024	194002	194003	the count	26666	" But probably Mr. Markham 's letter will explain to you that which you appear to have forgotten . "
194110	194116	194117	194117	he	903	" This is indeed singular ! "
194130	194161	194117	194117	he	903	" Who would have suspected that Allen was merely an agent ? who could have foreseen where that blow was to strike ? Strange — unaccountable concatenation of unfortunate circumstances ! "
194162	194174	194176	194177	the count	26666	" Is the writer of that letter correct in his statement ? "
194180	194204	194206	194207	Mr. Greenwood	903	" The information given to you by Mr. Markham , relative to the losses experienced by a certain Mr. Allen , is correct , "
194215	194274	194206	194207	Mr. Greenwood	903	" But , I take my God to witness , that , until this moment , I was unaware that either Mr. Monroe or Mr. Markham were in the remotest way connected with that affair ; and I also solemnly protest that I would have given worlds sooner than have been the means of injuring either of them ! "
194275	194297	194299	194300	the count	26666	" You admit , then , that you defrauded the people who at that time placed their funds in your hands ? "
194302	194310	194312	194313	the financier	30425	" I admit nothing of the kind , "
194322	194333	194312	194313	the financier	30425	" I admit nothing so base as your insinuation implies . "
194334	194351	194206	194207	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Then wherefore were you so agitated when you perused that letter from Mr. Richard Markham ? "
194352	194428	194430	194431	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Count Alteroni , I am not aware that I owe you any explanation of my own private feelings . It is true , I was agitated — and I am still deeply grieved , to think that my want of judgment and foresight in a certain speculation should have involved in ruin those whom I wish well ! But I suffered as well as they — I lost as many thousands as they did , "
194469	194506	194459	194461	so many persons	6746	" and although I have done nothing for which I can be blamed by the world , I may still reproach myself when I find that others whom I care for have suffered by my speculations . "
194554	194594	194549	194550	Mr. Greenwood	903	" When that unfortunate speculation of mine took place , I was not so experienced in the sinuosities of the commercial and financial worlds as I am now.—I lost my all , and poverty stared me in the face . "
194613	194752	194602	194602	he	903	" But by dint of some good fortune and much hard toil and unwearied application to business , I retrieved my circumstances . Now , answer me candidly , Count Alteroni ; is there any thing dishonourable in my career ? Will you judge a man upon an ex - parte statement ? Is not one story very good until another be told ? Why , if all persons viewed their affairs constantly in the same light , would there be any business for the civil tribunals ? Do not plaintiff and defendant invariably survey the point at issue between them under discrepant aspects ? If they did not , wherefore do they go to law ? You may allow Mr. Markham and Mr. Monroe to entertain their views ; you will also permit me to enjoy mine ? "
194753	194757	194759	194760	the count	26666	" Mr. Greenwood , "
194762	194785	194759	194760	the count	26666	" I am afraid I have been too severe — nay , even rude in my observations . You will forgive me ? "
194786	194796	194808	194808	he	30425	" My dear sir , say not another word , "
194833	194864	194865	194866	The count	26666	" that the Earl of Warrington was in the drawing - room , and requested an interview , at which his lordship would not detain the count above ten minutes . "
194942	194946	194948	194949	the earl	4112	" Your lordship , "
194951	194967	194948	194949	the earl	4112	" will , I hope , pardon this intrusion at so unseemly an hour — — "
194968	194977	194979	194980	Count Alteroni	1047	" The Earl of Warrington is always welcome , "
194982	195019	194979	194980	Count Alteroni	1047	" and if I can not give him so princely a reception in England as I was proud to do in Italy , it is my means and not my will , which is the cause . "
195020	195053	195055	195056	the earl	4112	" My lord , I beseech you not to allude to any discrepancy in that respect — a discrepancy which I can regret for your lordship only , and not for myself , "
195058	195080	195055	195056	the earl	4112	" Indeed , I am so far selfish on the present occasion , that I am come to ask a favour . "
195081	195095	195097	195098	the count	26666	" Name the matter in which my poor services can avail your lordship , "
195100	195112	195097	195098	the count	26666	" and I pledge myself in advance to meet your wishes . "
195113	195117	195119	195122	the Earl of Warrington	891	" My lord , "
195124	195248	195119	195122	the Earl of Warrington	891	" I must inform your lordship that I am somewhat interested in a cousin of mine of the name of Eliza Sydney . This lady loved a man who was unworthy of her — a wretch whose pursuits are villany , and who enriches himself at the expense of the unwary and confiding . The heartless scoundrel to whom I allude , and the full measure of whose infamy was only exposed to me this day , has endeavoured to possess himself of the person of Eliza in a manner the most atrocious and cowardly . My lord , he employed a confederate to administer soporific drugs to her ; but Providence moved that confederate 's heart , and frustrated the damnable scheme . "
195249	195266	195268	195269	the count	26666	" And can such conduct go unpunished in this land of excellent laws and unerring justice ? "
195271	195277	195279	195280	the earl	4112	" Ah ! my lord , "
195282	195389	195279	195280	the earl	4112	" this man is possessed of great wealth , and consequently of great influence ; for , in England , money is power ! Moreover , the complete chain of evidence is wanting ; and then exposure to the female in such a case is almost equal to a stigma and to shame ! To continue my brief tale , my lord — this man , with a demon heart , is one who will persecute my cousin Eliza to the very death . A lady of my acquaintance , who can also tell a tale of the unequalled villany of this George Montague Greenwood — — "
195390	195393	195395	195396	the count	26666	" What ! "
195398	195431	195395	195396	the count	26666	" do I hear aright ? or do my ears deceive me ? What name did you give the miscreant who administered opiate drugs to a woman with the foulest of motives ? "
195432	195437	195439	195440	the earl	4112	" George Montague Greenwood , "
195442	195446	195448	195449	the count	26666	" O God ! "
195465	195489	195448	195449	the count	26666	" I thank thee that thou hast intervened , ere it was too late , to prevent that fearful sacrifice of my daughter ! "
195490	195497	195499	195500	the earl	4112	" Pardon me , my lord , "
195502	195516	195499	195500	the earl	4112	" if I have awakened any disagreeable reminiscences , or produced impressions — — "
195517	195561	195568	195568	he	26666	" Your lordship has done me an infinite service , in fully opening my eyes to the villany of a man whose damnable sophistry glosses over his crimes with so deceptive a varnish , that the sight is dazzled when contemplating his conduct . "
195584	195591	195593	195595	the Italian noble	5278	" Another time , my lord , "
195597	195634	195593	195595	the Italian noble	5278	" I will explain to you the cause of my present emotions . You will then perceive how confirmed a miscreant is this Greenwood . In the meantime tell me how I can aid your lordship ? "
195635	195646	195648	195651	the Earl of Warrington	891	" I was about to inform you , my lord , "
195653	195717	195648	195651	the Earl of Warrington	891	" that Miss Sydney , alarmed and appalled at the persecution of this man , who seems to spare neither expense nor crime to accomplish any purpose upon which he has once set his mind , has determined to sojourn for a time upon the Continent . Your lordship is aware that I possess a humble villa in the suburbs of Montoni — — "
195718	195727	195729	195730	the count	26666	" A beautiful residence , on the contrary , "
195732	195736	195737	195737	he	26666	" and where , "
195743	195754	195737	195737	he	26666	" in happier times I have partaken of your hospitality . "
195755	195770	195772	195773	the earl	4112	" Yes , your lordship has honoured me with your society at that retreat , "
195782	195853	195772	195773	the earl	4112	" It is to that villa that I now propose to despatch my cousin , in order that she may escape the persecutions and the plots of this vile Greenwood . The object of my present visit is to solicit your lordship for a few letters of introduction for Miss Sydney to some of those families in Montoni with whom she may experience the charms of profitable and intellectual society . "
195854	195859	195861	195862	the count	26666	" With much pleasure , "
195864	195874	195861	195862	the count	26666	" When does Miss Sydney propose to leave England ? "
195875	195886	195772	195773	the earl	4112	" The day after to - morrow , my lord . "
195887	195947	195861	195862	the count	26666	" To - morrow evening your lordship shall receive the letters which Miss Sydney requires . They will of course be unsealed — both in observance of the rules of etiquette , and on account of the custom - house officers in the continental states ; but your lordship will take care that they be not opened in England . "
195948	195986	195987	195990	The Earl of Warrington	891	" I comprehend you , my lord . The incognito which your lordship chooses to preserve in this country shall not be disturbed by any indiscretion on the part of myself or of those connected with me . "
196018	196034	196002	196003	the count	26666	" Request Mr. Greenwood to favour me with his company in this room — here ! "
196056	196060	196062	196064	the Italian nobleman	30184	" Mr. Greenwood , "
196066	196090	196062	196064	the Italian nobleman	30184	" I think you recollect the subject of our conversation when I was called away by the visit of the Earl of Warrington ? "
196091	196094	196096	196097	the financier	30425	" Perfectly , "

196141	196146	196148	196149	the count	26666	" Then , sir , "
196163	196261	196148	196149	the count	26666	" if you be really such an honourable and such an injured man as you would represent , and if you be really grieved when you hear that a fellow - creature has been ruined by the failure of your speculations , have the kindness to return me the money which I have confided to you , and I shall be inclined to think of you as you choose to think of yourself . To tell the truth , I am already sick of the uncertainty of speculation ; and would rather withdraw from the enterprise altogether . "
196262	196269	196271	196272	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Really , my dear sir , "
196274	196289	196271	196272	Mr. Greenwood	903	" this demand is so very irregular — so exceedingly unbusiness - like — — "
196290	196304	196306	196307	the count	26666	" We will not place it upon the footing of business , sir , "
196310	196321	196306	196307	the count	26666	" we will place it upon the basis of honour . "
196322	196336	196338	196339	the financier	30425	" Honour and business with me , my dear sir , are synonymous , "
196344	196350	196338	196339	the financier	30425	" So much the better ! "
196355	196388	196352	196353	the count	26666	" I see that we shall not dispute over this matter . The whole is summed up in a few words : return me the money I have placed in your hands . "
196389	196404	196406	196407	Mr. Greenwood	903	" These things can not be done in a hurry , my dear sir , "
196424	196443	196445	196446	the count	26666	" Either you have made away with my money , or you have it in your possession still , "
196448	196478	196445	196446	the count	26666	" If you have it , give me a cheque upon your banker for the amount : if you have placed it out at interest , give me security . "

196534	196539	196522	196522	you	903	" demanded the count . "

196658	196672	196610	196610	you	903	" cried Mr. Greenwood , an idea apparently striking him at that moment . "

196729	196734	196735	196736	James Tomlinson	1005	" asked the count . "
196738	196743	196735	196736	James Tomlinson	1005	" answered the financier . "

196806	196807	196784	196784	I	0	" "
196817	198023	196814	196815	Mr. Greenwood	903	" returned the count . The financier then took his departure . THE native of London is as proud of the City as if it were his own property . He can afford to be called a cockney for having been born within the sound of Bow bells , for there are merchant - princes , and the peers and monopolists of the commerce of this world , who bear the nickname as well as he . And well may the Londoner be proud of his city in numerous respects . It is the richest and the most powerful that the world has ever seen ! The dingy back parlours in Lombard Street , the upstairs business rooms in Cheapside , and the warehouses with shutters half up the windows in Wood Street and its neighbourhood , are the mysterious places in which the springs of the finance and trade of a mighty empire are set in motion ? Half a dozen men in the City can command in an hour more wealth than either Rome or Babylon had to boast of at the respective periods of their greatest prosperity . And neither Rome nor Babylon possessed drapers who cleared their fifty thousand a - year by selling gowns and shawls , nor sugar - bakers with a million in hard cash , nor grocers with a plum in each hand , nor brewers to whom the rise or fall of one halfpenny per pot in the price of beer makes a difference of forty thousand pounds per annum ! Rome , Babylon , Thebes , and Carthage , could all have been purchased by the East India Company — with perhaps a mortgage upon the India Docks ! But the reader must not imagine that all which glitters is gold . Amongst the most splendid establishments in London , and those most wealthy in appearance , there are some in a hopeless state of insolvency . To one of these we shall now introduce those who may choose to accompany us thither . The well - known banking - house of James Tomlinson was situated in Lombard Street . The establishment was not extensive ; nor were there a great many clerks , because it did little agency business for country banks , but was chiefly a house of deposit . It enjoyed a high reputation , and was considered as safe as the presumed wealth , integrity , and experience of its proprietor were likely to render it . It was moreover believed that the father of James Tomlinson was a sleeping partner ; and as the old gentleman had retired from the business of oilman with an immense fortune , the bank was presumed to possess every guarantee of stability . It had existed for upwards of sixty years , having been founded and most successfully carried on by an uncle of James Tomlinson . James himself had originally entered the establishment as a clerk , whence he rose to be a partner , and finally found himself at the head of the concern at his uncle 's death . James Tomlinson was not an extravagant man ; but he was not possessed of the ability and experience for which the world gave him credit . In the year 1826 , and at the age of forty , he found himself at the head of a flourishing and respectable establishment . He was indeed the sole proprietor , for his father was in reality totally unconnected with it as a partner . James was intimately acquainted with the mechanical routine of the bank business ; but he was deficient in those powers of combination and faculties of foresight which were necessary to enable him to lay out to the best advantage the moneys deposited in his hands . With good intentions , he lacked talent . He was an excellent head clerk or junior partner ; but he was totally unfitted for supreme management . Thus was it that in two or three years he experienced serious reverses ; and , although he carefully concealed the failure of his operations from all human eyes , the very safety of his establishment was seriously compromised . The French Revolution of 1830 ruined a Paris house to which Tomlinson had advanced a considerable sum ; and this blow consummated the insolvency of his bank . He was then compelled to make a confidant of his cashier , an old and faithful servant of his uncle , and of frugal habits , and kind but eccentric disposition . Michael Martin was this individual 's name . He was of very repulsive appearance , stooping in his gait , blear - eyed , and dirty in person . He took vast quantities of snuff ; but as much lodged upon his shirt - frill and waistcoat as was thrust up his nose . Thus his linen was invariably filthy in the extreme . His dress was a suit of seedy black ; and the right thigh of his trousers was brown and grimy with the marks of snuff — for upon that part of his attire did he invariably wipe his finger and thumb after taking a pinch of his brown rappee . Such was the individual whom Tomlinson took into his confidence , when the affairs of the bank grew desperate . Old Martin was as close and reserved as if he were both deaf and dumb ; and he was moreover possessed of a peculiar craftiness and cunning which admirably fitted him for the part that he was now to enact . Although it was next to impossible to retrieve the affairs of the bank , so great was the deficiency,—still Michael Martin assured his master that it was quite probable that they might be enabled to carry on the establishment for a length of time — perhaps even many years , the chances that the draughts upon the bank would not equal the deposits being in their favour . Thus was this insolvent and ruined establishment carried on , with seeming respectability and success , by the perseverance of Tomlinson , and the skill and craft of old Martin . We shall now introduce our readers into the parlour of the bank , at ten o'clock in the morning after the incidents related in the preceding chapter . James Tomlinson had just arrived , and was standing before the fire , glancing over the City Article of The Times . He was a fine , tall , good - looking man , plainly dressed , and without the slightest affectation either in manner or attire . The bluntness and apparent straightforwardness of his character had won and secured him many friends amongst a class of men who regard frankness of disposition and plainness of demeanour as qualities indicative of solidity of position and regular habits of business . Then he was always at his post — always to be seen ; and hence unlimited confidence was placed in him ! Having glanced over the newspaper which he held in his hand , he rang the bell . A clerk responded to the summons . "

198036	198037	198034	198034	sir	26649	" "
198045	198066	198034	198034	sir	26649	" The clerk withdrew ; and the old cashier entered the room , the door of which he carefully closed . "
198072	198077	198070	198070	Michael	1105	" said the banker . "
198081	198082	198034	198034	sir	26649	" "
198087	198100	198101	198101	We	6797	" answered the old man , with a species of savage grunt . "
198115	198116	198125	198125	you	1105	" "
198129	198156	198125	198125	you	1105	" observed Tomlinson , with a sigh ; and then his countenance suddenly wore an expression of ineffable despair — as evanescent as it was poignant . "
198165	198169	198217	198218	my God	27430	" said Michael : "
198212	198213	198214	198215	My God	27430	" "
198224	198228	198247	198247	themselves	6801	" exclaimed Tomlinson . "
198285	198286	198266	198267	a beggar	29173	" "
198293	198300	198301	198301	We	6808	" interrupted the old cashier impatiently . "
198309	198310	198301	198301	We	6808	" "
198321	198338	198301	198301	We	6808	" demanded the banker , putting the question with evident alarm — almost amounting to horror . "
198360	198365	198411	198411	Greenwood	903	" answered the cashier . "
198370	198374	198411	198411	Greenwood	903	" ejaculated Tomlinson . "
198394	198395	198396	198396	We	6808	" "
198404	198410	198396	198396	We	6808	" said the cashier rudely . "
198424	198425	198411	198411	Greenwood	903	" "
198434	198439	198432	198432	Michael	1105	" exclaimed the banker . "
198467	198468	198469	198469	I	0	" "
198484	198489	198481	198481	you	6809	" muttered the cashier . "
198498	198503	198504	198504	He	903	" added the banker . "
198540	198541	198542	198542	I	0	" "
198554	198558	198542	198542	I	0	" cried Tomlinson . "
198634	198635	198663	198663	his	4049	" "
198642	198654	198663	198663	his	4049	" observed the cashier , taking a huge pinch of snuff . "
198683	198687	198663	198663	his	4049	" continued Tomlinson , "
198732	198733	198722	198722	I	0	" "
198743	198747	198722	198722	I	0	" observed Michael . "
198771	198775	198776	198780	The functionary who received me	6818	" returned Tomlinson . "
198921	198928	198896	198896	God	880	" added the banker , thoughtfully . "
198947	198964	198896	198896	God	880	" said the old cashier , again regaling his nose with a copious pinch of snuff . "
198975	198984	198968	198968	myself	0	" observed the banker , with a shudder . "
199064	199065	199054	199056	the government broker	6830	" "
199075	199079	199054	199056	the government broker	6830	" demanded Martin . "
199084	199085	199054	199056	the government broker	6830	" "
199113	199117	199118	199118	You	6833	" continued Tomlinson . "
199217	199306	199176	199176	I	0	" At this moment a clerk entered , and informed the cashier that he was wanted in the public office . As soon as Michael had disappeared , the banker walked up and down his parlour , a prey to the most maddening reflections . There were but five thousand pounds left in the safe ; two thousand were to be paid to Greenwood ; and every minute a cheque , or two or three cheques might be presented , which would crush the bank at one blow . "
199316	199322	199176	199176	I	0	" murmured Tomlinson to himself , "
199331	199393	199176	199176	I	0	" Ah ! little thought those who passed by the banking - house at that moment , what heart - felt , horrible tortures were endured by the master of the establishment in his own parlour ! At length Martin returned . His countenance never revealed any emotions ; but he took snuff wholesale — and that was a fearful omen . "
199396	199407	199176	199176	I	0	" said Tomlinson , in a hoarse and hollow voice . "
199424	199429	199418	199419	Colonel Brown	1110	" replied the cashier . "
199437	199442	199418	199419	Colonel Brown	1110	" ejaculated the banker . "
199449	199454	199418	199419	Colonel Brown	1110	" asked the cashier . "
199466	199470	199418	199419	Colonel Brown	1110	" answered Tomlinson . "
199507	199508	199488	199488	Michael	1105	" "
199511	199518	199488	199488	Michael	1105	" said the old man coldly . "
199543	199544	199488	199488	Michael	1105	" "
199551	199574	199488	199488	Michael	1105	" returned Martin , taking more snuff . At that moment Mr. Greenwood was announced , and Michael withdrew from the parlour . "
199584	199596	199575	199575	You	6842	" said the banker , after the usual interchange of civilities . "
199607	199612	199599	199599	I	0	" replied the financier ; "
199628	199629	199625	199626	Count Alteroni	1047	" "
199635	199639	199625	199626	Count Alteroni	1047	" observed Tomlinson . "
199660	199661	199652	199652	I	0	" "
199669	199673	199652	199652	I	0	" said Greenwood ; "
199688	199689	199690	199691	My God	27430	" "
199693	199697	199690	199691	My God	27430	" cried Tomlinson ; "
199733	199734	199729	199729	me	0	" "
199745	199750	199751	199751	I	0	" said the financier : "
199779	199780	199768	199768	I	0	" "
199784	199793	199804	199804	you	903	" ejaculated the banker , clenching his fists ; "
199854	199855	199838	199838	you	903	" "
199866	199870	199872	199872	I	0	" said Greenwood , "
199883	199884	199885	199885	You	903	" "
199899	199909	199885	199885	You	903	" inquired the banker . Greenwood nodded an affirmative . "
199920	199921	199912	199912	he	6846	" "
199939	199949	199924	199924	he	6846	" added the financier , with a significant smile , "
199955	199995	199924	199924	he	6846	" Tomlinson appeared to reflect profoundly . His reverie was interrupted by the entrance of old Martin , taking snuff more vehemently than ever . The cashier whispered something in the banker 's ear , and then again retired . "
200003	200007	200011	200011	Greenwood	903	" cried Tomlinson : "
200033	200048	200029	200029	your	903	" This was precisely the point to which the financier was anxious to arrive . "
200051	200062	200029	200029	your	903	" he said , playing with his watch - chain . "
200100	200101	200089	200089	I	0	" "
200104	200108	200119	200119	Greenwood	903	" ejaculated Tomlinson ; "
200127	200128	200129	200129	I	0	" "
200138	200144	200129	200129	I	0	" returned the financier coolly . "
200191	200192	200182	200182	I	0	" "
200207	200211	200198	200198	you	903	" cried Tomlinson . "
200228	200229	200222	200222	your	903	" "
200244	200256	200222	200222	your	903	" said Greenwood , still playing with his watch - chain . "
200268	200273	200259	200260	my God	27430	" exclaimed the banker . "
200299	200316	200317	200318	Mr. Martin	1107	" With these words he rang the bell violently . Old Martin immediately made his appearance . "
200320	200334	200317	200318	Mr. Martin	1107	" said Tomlinson , affecting a calmness which he was far from feeling , "
200343	200344	200317	200318	Mr. Martin	1107	" "
200351	200362	200317	200318	Mr. Martin	1107	" growled Michael , taking a huge pinch of snuff . "
200368	200373	200317	200318	Mr. Martin	1107	" ejaculated the banker . "
200376	200384	200317	200318	Mr. Martin	1107	" answered the old man , doggedly : "
200404	200421	200422	200422	I	0	" Tomlinson walked once up the room ; then , turning to Greenwood , he said , "
200431	200439	200428	200429	Mr. Martin	1107	" he added , addressing the cashier , "
200453	200459	200450	200451	Mr. Greenwood	903	" The old man withdrew . "
200473	200482	200483	200484	The count	26666	" demanded Tomlinson , after a short pause . "
200507	200508	200494	200494	I	0	" "
200522	200529	200509	200509	You	0	" said the banker , ironically . "
200532	200541	200509	200509	You	0	" answered Greenwood , with his usual coolness . "
200573	200574	200575	200575	I	0	" "
200583	200587	200575	200575	I	0	" said Tomlinson . "
200600	200615	200593	200594	the count	26666	" Half an hour passed away ; and the Italian nobleman made his appearance . "
200627	200639	200625	200625	count	29320	" exclaimed Mr. Greenwood , with an ironical smile of triumph . "
200732	200733	200734	200734	I	0	" "
200742	200747	200734	200734	I	0	" said the count , "
200763	200764	200739	200740	Mr. Greenwood	903	" "
200773	200778	200781	200781	you	0	" exclaimed the financier , "
200816	200841	200804	200805	Mr. Tomlinson	1005	" The business was settled as Mr. Greenwood proposed . The count returned the financier his receipt , and accepted one from the banker . "
200851	200865	200849	200849	count	29320	" said Mr. Greenwood , placing the receipt in his pocket - book , "
200875	200876	200866	200866	I	0	" "
200882	200894	200878	200878	me	0	" returned the count , his features assuming a stern expression : "
200930	200931	200912	200912	you	26649	" "
200935	200940	200932	200933	Count Alteroni	1047	" began Mr. Greenwood , "
200947	200948	200941	200941	I	0	" "
200953	200961	200951	200951	sir	26649	" cried the Italian noble , imperatively : "
201019	201024	201016	201017	Mr. Tomlinson	1005	" added the count , "
201041	201072	201073	201073	He	1005	" Count Alteroni bowed politely to the banker , and , darting a withering glance of mingled contempt and indignation upon the abashed and astounded Greenwood , took his departure . "
201084	201244	201073	201073	He	1005	" said Greenwood , recovering an outward appearance of composure , though inwardly he was chagrined beyond description . Tomlinson made no reply : he was too much occupied with his own affairs to be able to afford attention to those of others . Greenwood shortly took his leave — delighted at having effectually settled his pecuniary obligation with the count , in such a manner that it could never again be the means of molestation in respect to himself,—but vexed at the discovery which the Italian nobleman had evidently made in respect to his conduct towards Eliza Sydney . Immediately after Mr. Greenwood had left the bank - parlour , old Michael entered . This time he carried his snuff - box open in his left hand ; and at every two paces he took a copious pinch with the fore - finger and thumb of his right . This was a fearful omen ; and Tomlinson trembled . "
201251	201252	201247	201247	Michael	1105	" "
201267	201273	201259	201259	Draughts	1111	" said the old cashier . "
201285	201286	201259	201259	Draughts	1111	" "
201291	201301	201311	201311	Michael	1105	" ejaculated the banker , clasping his hands together : "
201313	201314	201311	201311	Michael	1105	" "
201317	201324	201311	201311	Michael	1105	" said the cashier , gruffly . "
201334	201338	201311	201311	Michael	1105	" cried Tomlinson : "
201350	201351	201353	201353	you	6869	" "
201367	201371	201353	201353	you	6869	" inquired Michael . "
201386	201464	201374	201374	yourself	6869	" said the banker , whose countenance was ashy pale , and whose limbs trembled under him , as if he expected the officers of justice to drag him to a place of execution . The old cashier seated himself at the table , and wrote out the announcement that the bank was unfortunately compelled to suspend its payments . He then read it to the ruined man who was now pacing the apartment with agitated steps . "
201469	201470	201374	201374	yourself	6869	" "
201473	201478	201374	201374	yourself	6869	" answered the banker ; "
201496	201569	201485	201485	me	0	" Tomlinson was about to rush distractedly out of the room , when the cashier was summoned into the public department of the establishment . Five minutes elapsed ere his return — five minutes which appeared five hours to James Tomlinson . At length the old man came back ; and this time he did not carry his snuff - box in his hand . Without uttering a word , he took the "
201573	201591	201485	201485	me	0	" off the table , crushed it in his hand , and threw it into the fire . "
201596	201626	201485	201485	me	0	" he murmured , as he watched the paper burning to tinder ; and when it was completely consumed , he took a long and hearty pinch of snuff . "
201629	201633	201635	201635	you	6872	" echoed Tomlinson : "
201643	201644	201635	201635	you	6872	" "
201664	202066	201635	201635	you	6872	" answered the cashier , coolly and leisurely , as if he himself experienced not the slightest emotion . In another hour there were fifteen thousand pounds in the safe ; and when the bank closed that evening at the usual time , this sum had swollen up to twenty thousand and some hundreds . This day was a specimen of the life of James Tomlinson , the banker . Readers , when you pass by the grand commercial and financial establishments of this great metropolis , pause and reflect ere you envy their proprietors ! In the parlours and offices of those reputed emporiums of wealth are men whose minds are a prey to the most agonising feelings — the most poignant emotions . There is no situation so full of responsibility as that of a banker — no trust so sacred as that which is confided to him . When he fails , it is not the ruin of one man which is accomplished : it is the ruin of hundreds — perhaps thousands . The effects of that one failure are ramified through a wide section of society : widows and orphans are reduced to beggary — and those who have been well and tenderly nurtured are driven to the workhouse . And yet the law punishes not the great banker who fails , and who involves thousands in his ruin . The petty trader who breaks for fifty pounds is thrown into prison , and is placed at the tender mercy of the Insolvents ' Court , which perhaps remands him to a debtor 's gaol for a year , for having contracted debts without a reasonable chance of paying them . But the great banker , who commenced business with a hundred thousand pounds , and who has dissipated five hundred thousand belonging to others , applies to the Bankruptcy Court , never sees the inside of a prison at all , and in due time receives a certificate , which clears him of all his liabilities , and enables him to begin the world anew . The petty trader passes a weary time in gaol , and is then merely emancipated from his confinement — but not from his debts . His future exertions are clogged by an impending weight of liability . One system or the other is wrong:—decide , O ye legislators who vaunt "
202073	202161	202070	202071	your ancestors	6875	" which should be retained , and which abolished,—or whether both should be modified ! * * * * * In the course of the evening the Earl of Warrington called upon Mrs. Arlington , with whom he passed a few minutes alone in the drawing - room . When his lordship had taken his departure , Diana returned to Eliza whom she had left in another apartment , and , placing a quantity of letters , folded , but unsealed , in her hands , said , "
202238	202246	202231	202231	He	4112	" added Diana , with a smile , "
202283	202284	202266	202266	He	4112	" "
202288	202297	202266	202266	He	4112	" answered Eliza , glancing over their superscriptions , "
202355	202356	202335	202335	you	6879	" "
202367	202372	202357	202358	The earl	4112	" replied Mrs. Arlington . "

WE now come to a sad episode in our history — and yet one in which there is perhaps less romance and more truth than in any scene yet depicted . We have already warned our reader that he will have to accompany us amidst appalling scenes of vice and wretchedness:—we are now about to introduce him to one of destitution and suffering — of powerful struggle and unavailing toil — whose details are so very sad , that we have been able to find no better heading for our chapter than miserrima , or "
202610	204169	202429	202429	his	4112	" The reader will remember that we have brought our narrative , in preceding chapters , up to the end of 1838:—we must now go back for a period of two years , in order to commence the harrowing details of our present episode . In one of the low dark rooms of a gloomy house in a court leading out of Golden Lane , St. Luke 's , a young girl of seventeen sate at work . It was about nine o'clock in the evening ; and a single candle lighted the miserable chamber , which was almost completely denuded of furniture . The cold wind of December whistled through the ill - closed casement and the broken panes , over which thin paper had been pasted to repel the biting chill . A small deal table , two common chairs , and a mattress were all the articles of furniture which this wretched room contained . A door at the end opposite the window opened into another and smaller chamber : and this latter one was furnished with nothing , save an old mattress . There were no blankets — no coverlids in either room . The occupants had no other covering at night than their own clothes;—and those clothes — God knows they were thin , worn , and scanty enough ! Not a spark of fire burned in the grate;—and yet that front room in which the young girl was seated was as cold as the nave of a vast cathedral in the depth of winter . The reader has perhaps experienced that icy chill which seems to strike to the very marrow of the bones , when entering a huge stone edifice:—the cold which prevailed in that room , and in which the young creature was at work with her needle , was more intense — more penetrating — more bitter — more frost - like than even that icy chill ! Miserable and cheerless was that chamber : the dull light of the candle only served to render its nakedness the more apparent , without relieving it of any of its gloom . And as the cold draught from the wretched casement caused the flame of that candle to flicker and oscillate , the poor girl was compelled to seat herself between the window and the table , to protect her light from the wind . Thus , the chilling December blast blew upon the back of the young sempstress , whose clothing was so thin and scant — so very scant ! The sempstress was , as we have before said , about seventeen years of age . She was very beautiful ; and her features , although pale with want , and wan with care and long vigils , were pleasing and agreeable . The cast of her countenance was purely Grecian — the shape of her head eminently classical — and her form was of a perfect and symmetrical mould . Although clothed in the most scanty and wretched manner , she was singularly neat and clean in her appearance ; and her air and demeanour were far above her humble occupation and her impoverished condition . She had , indeed , seen better days ! Reared in the lap of luxury by fond , but too indulgent parents , her education had been of a high order ; and thus her qualifications were rather calculated to embellish her in prosperity than to prove of use to her in adversity . She had lost her mother at the age of twelve ; and her father — kind and fond , and proud of his only child — had sought to make her shine in that sphere which she had then appeared destined to adorn . But misfortunes came upon them like a thunderbolt : and when poverty — grim poverty stared them in the face — this poor girl had no resource , save her needle ! Now and then her father earned a trifle in the City , by making out accounts or copying deeds;—but sorrow and ill - health had almost entirely incapacitated him from labour or occupation of any kind;—and his young and affectionate daughter was compelled to toil from sun - rise until a late hour in the night to earn even a pittance . One after another , all their little comforts , in the shape of furniture and clothing , disappeared ; and after vainly endeavouring to maintain a humble lodging in a cheap but respectable neighbourhood , poverty compelled them to take refuge in that dark , narrow , filthy court leading out of Golden Lane . Such was the sad fate of Mr. Monroe and his daughter Ellen . At the time when we introduce the latter to our readers , her father was absent in the City . He had a little occupation in a counting house , which was to last three days , which kept him hard at work from nine in the morning till eleven at night , and for which he was to receive a pittance so small we dare not mention its amount ! This is how it was:—an official assignee belonging to the Bankruptcy Court had some heavy accounts to make up by a certain day : he was consequently compelled to employ an accountant to aid him ; the accountant employed a petty scrivener to make out the balance - sheet ; and the petty scrivener employed Monroe to ease him of a portion of the toil . It is therefore plain that Monroe was not to receive much for his three days ' labour . And so Ellen was compelled to toil and work , and work and toil — to rise early , and go to bed late — so late that she had scarcely fallen asleep , worn out with fatigue , when it appeared time to get up again;—and thus the roses forsook her cheeks — and her health suffered — and her head ached — and her eyes grew dim — and her limbs were stiff with the chill ! And so she worked and tolled , and toiled and worked . We said it was about nine o'clock in the evening . Ellen 's fingers were almost paralysed with cold and labour ; and yet the work which she had in her hands must be done that night ; else no supper then — and no breakfast on the morrow ; for on the shelf in that cheerless chamber there was not a morsel of bread ! And for sixteen hours had that poor girl fasted already ; for she had eaten a crust at five in the morning , when she had risen from her hard cold couch in the back chamber . She had left the larger portion of the bread that then remained , for her father ; and she had assured him that she had a few halfpence to purchase more for herself — but she had therein deceived him ! Ah ! how noble and generous was that deception;—and how often — how very often did that poor girl practise it ! Ellen had risen at five that morning to embroider a silk shawl with eighty flowers . She had calculated upon finishing it by eight in the evening ; but , although she had worked , and worked , and worked hour after hour , without ceasing , save for a moment at long intervals to rest her aching head and stretch her cramped fingers , eight had struck — and nine had struck also — and still the blossoms were not all embroidered . It was a quarter to ten when the last stitch was put into the last flower . But then the poor creature could not rest:—not to her was it allowed to repose after that severe day of toil ! She was hungry — she was faint — her stomach was sick for want of food ; and at eleven her father would come home , hungry , faint , and sick at stomach also ! Rising from her chair — every limb stiff , cramped , and aching with cold and weariness — the poor creature put on her modest straw bonnet with a faded riband , and her thin wretched shawl , to take home her work . Her employer dwelt upon Finsbury Pavement ; and as it was now late , the poor girl was compelled to hasten as fast as her aching limbs would carry her . The shop to which she repaired was brilliant with lamps and gas - lights . Articles of great variety and large value were piled in the windows , on the counters , on the shelves . Upwards of twenty young men were busily employed in serving the customers . The proprietor of that establishment was at that moment entertaining a party of friends up stairs , at a champagne supper ! The young girl walked timidly into the vast magazine of fashions , and , with downcast eyes , advanced towards an elderly woman who was sitting at a counter at the farther end of the shop . To this female did she present the shawl . "
204178	204183	202429	202429	his	4112	" murmured the shopwoman . "
204196	204197	204198	204198	I	0	" "
204209	204213	204215	204215	I	0	" answered Ellen ; "
204222	204223	204215	204215	I	0	" "
204229	204244	204226	204226	I	0	" exclaimed the shopwoman , turning the shawl over , and examining it critically ; "
204255	204256	204252	204252	I	0	" "
204259	204263	204252	204252	I	0	" said Ellen ; "
204272	204273	204276	204276	Miss	27067	" "
204289	204290	204293	204293	ma'am	26745	" "
204295	204308	204293	204293	ma'am	26745	" ejaculated the young girl , the tears starting into her eyes ; "
204319	204320	204327	204327	Miss.	1116	" "
204337	204338	204332	204332	you	26745	" "
204349	204385	204339	204339	I	0	" The poor girl spoke deferentially to this cold - hearted woman , in order to make her generous . Oh ! poverty renders even the innocence of seventeen selfish , mundane , and calculating ! "
204397	204429	204430	204430	You	26745	" said the woman , turning the shawl over and over , and scrutinising it in all points ; but she could not discover a single fault in Ellen 's work . "
204459	204478	204456	204456	I	0	" she added , thrusting her hand into the till under the counter , and drawing forth sixpence , "
204486	204487	204488	204488	Madam	26758	" "
204490	204498	204488	204488	Madam	26758	" said Ellen , bursting into tears , "
204509	204523	204499	204499	I	0	" She could say no more : her voice was lost in sobs . "
204528	204534	204499	204499	I	0	" cried the shopwoman harshly , "
204569	204588	204590	204590	you	26745	" Ellen took up the sixpence , wiped her eyes , and hastily turned to leave the shop . "
204597	204616	204590	204590	you	26745	" demanded the shopwoman abruptly . The fact was that the poor girl worked well , and did not "
204618	204644	204499	204499	I	0	" labour ; and the woman knew that it was the interest of her master to retain that young creature 's services . Those words , "
204653	205003	204499	204499	I	0	" reminded Ellen that she and her father must live — that they could not starve ! She accordingly turned towards that uncouth female once more , and received another shawl , to embroider in the same manner , and at the same price ! Eighty blossoms for sixpence ! Sixteen hours ' work for sixpence ! ! A farthing and a half per hour ! ! ! The young girl returned to the dirty court in Golden Lane , after purchasing some food , coarse and cheap , on her way home . On the ground - floor of a house in the same court dwelt an old woman — one of those old women who are the moral sewers of great towns — the sinks towards which flow all the impurities of the human passions . One of those abominable hags was she who dishonour the sanctity of old age . She had hideous wrinkles upon her face ; and as she stretched out her huge , dry , and bony hand , and tapped the young girl upon the shoulder , as the latter hurried past her door , the very touch seemed to chill the maiden even through her clothes . Ellen turned abruptly round , and shuddered — she scarcely knew why — when she found herself confronting that old hag by the dim lustre of the lights which shone through the windows in the narrow court . That old woman , who was the widow of crime , assumed as pleasant an aspect as her horrible countenance would allow her to put on , and addressed the timid maiden in a strain which the latter scarcely comprehended . All that Ellen could understand was that the old woman suspected how hardly she toiled and how badly she was paid , and offered to point out a more pleasant and profitable mode of earning money . Without precisely knowing why , Ellen shrank from the contact of that hideous old hag , and trembled at the words which issued from the crone 's mouth . "
205010	205015	205004	205004	You	6893	" said the wretch . "
205057	205221	205046	205046	you	6893	" Thus saying , the old hag turned abruptly into her own den , the door of which she banged violently . With her heart fluttering like a little bird in its cage , poor Ellen hastened to her own miserable abode . She placed the food upon the table , but would not touch it until her father should return . She longed for a spark of fire , for she was so cold and so wretched — and even in warm weather misery makes one shiver ! But that room was as cold as an ice - house — and the unhappiness of that poor girl was a burden almost too heavy for her to bear . She sate down , and thought . Oh ! how poignant is meditation in such a condition as hers . Her prospects were utterly black and hopeless . When she and her father had first taken those lodgings , she had obtained work from a "
205226	205960	205046	205046	you	6893	" This middle - woman was one who contracted with great drapery and upholstery firms to do their needle - work at certain low rates . The middle - woman had to live , and was therefore compelled to make a decent profit upon the work . So she gave it out to poor creatures like Ellen Monroe , and got it done for next to nothing . Thus for some weeks had Ellen made shirts — with the collars , wristbands , and fronts all well stitched — for four - pence the shirt . And it took her twelve hours , without intermission , to make a shirt : and it cost her a penny for needles , and thread , and candle . She therefore had three - pence for herself ! Twelve hours ' unwearied toil for three - pence ! ! One farthing an hour ! ! ! Sometimes she had made dissecting - trousers , which were sold to the medical students at the hospitals ; and for those she was paid two - pence halfpenny each . It occupied her eight hours to make one pair of those trousers ! At length the middle - woman had recommended her to the linen - draper 's establishment on Finsbury Pavement ; and there she was told that she might have plenty of work , and be well paid . Well paid ! At the rate of a farthing and a half per hour ! ! Oh ! it was a mockery — a hideous mockery , to give that young creature gay flowers and blossoms to work — she , who was working her own winding - sheet ! She sate , shivering with the cold , awaiting her father 's return . Ever and anon the words of that old crone who had addressed her in the court , rang in her ears . What could she mean ? How could she — stern in her own wretchedness herself , and perhaps stern to the wretchedness of others — how could that old hag possess the means of teaching her a pleasant and profitable mode of earning money ? The soul of Ellen was purity itself — although she dwelt in that low , obscene , filthy , and disreputable neighbourhood . She seemed like a solitary lily in the midst of a black morass swarming with reptiles ! The words of the old woman were therefore unintelligible to that fair young creature of seventeen:—and yet she intuitively reproached herself for pondering upon them . Oh ! mysterious influence of an all - wise and all - seeing Providence , that thus furnishes warnings against dangers yet unseen ! She tried to avert her thoughts from the contemplation of her own misery , and of the tempting offer made to her by the wrinkled harridan in the adjoining house ; and so she busied herself with thinking of the condition of the other lodgers in the same tenement which she and her father inhabited . She then perceived that there were others in the world as wretched and as badly off as herself ; but , in contradiction to the detestable maxim of Rochefoucauld — she found no consolation in this conviction . In the attics were Irish families , whose children ran all day , half naked , about the court and lane , paddling with their poor cold bare feet in the puddle or the snow , and apparently thriving in dirt , hunger , and privation . Ellen and her father occupied the two rooms on the second floor . On the first floor , in the front room , lived two families — an elderly man and woman , with their grown - up sons and daughters ; and with one of those sons were a wife and young children . Eleven souls thus herded together , without shame , in a room eighteen feet wide ! These eleven human beings , dwelling in so swine - like a manner , existed upon twenty - five shillings a week , the joint earnings of all of them who were able to work . In the back chamber on the same floor was a tailor , with a paralytic wife and a complete tribe of children . This poor wretch worked for a celebrated "
205964	206405	205046	205046	you	6893	" and sometimes toiled for twenty hours a - day — never less than seventeen , Sunday included — to earn — what ? Eight shillings a week . He made mackintoshes at the rate of one shilling and three - pence each ; and he could make one each day . But then he had to find needles and thread ; and the cost of these , together with candles , amounted to nine - pence a week . He thus had eight shillings remaining for himself , after working like a slave , without recreation or rest , even upon the sabbath , seventeen hours every day . A week contains a hundred and sixty - eight hours . And he worked a hundred and nineteen hours each week ! And earned eight shillings ! ! A decimal more than three farthings an hour ! ! ! On the ground floor of the house the tenants were no better off . In the front room dwelt a poor costermonger , or hawker of fruit , who earned upon an average seven shillings a week , out of which he was compelled to pay one shilling to treat the policeman upon the beat where he took his stand . His wife did a little washing , and perhaps earned eighteen - pence . And that was all this poor couple with four children had to subsist upon . The back room on the ground floor was occupied by the landlady of the house . She paid twelve shillings a week for rent and taxes , and let the various rooms for an aggregate of twenty - one shillings . She thus had nine shillings to live upon , supposing that every one of her lodgers paid her — which was never the case . Poor Ellen , in reflecting in this manner upon the condition of her neighbours , found herself surrounded on all sides by misery . Misery was above — misery below : misery was on the right and on the left . Misery was the genius of that dwelling , and of every other in that court . Misery was the cold and speechless companion of the young girl as she sate in that icy chamber : misery spread her meal , and made her bed , and was her chambermaid at morning and at night ! Eleven o'clock struck by St. Luke 's church ; and Mr. Monroe returned to his wretched abode . It had begun to rain shortly after Ellen had returned home ; and the old man was wet to the skin . "
206412	206418	206408	206410	my dear father	28616	" exclaimed the poor girl , "
206435	206436	206419	206419	you	28616	" "
206445	206464	206438	206438	I	0	" returned the heart - broken father , pressing his thin lips upon the forehead of his daughter . "
206478	206658	206471	206471	Nell	1118	" Without uttering a word , Ellen hastened out of the room , and begged a few sticks from one lodger , and a little coal from another . It would shame the affluent great , did they know how ready are the miserable — miserable poor to assist each other ! With her delicate taper fingers — with those little white hands which seemed never made to do menial service , the young girl laid the fire ; and when she saw the flame blazing cheerfully up the chimney , she turned towards the old man — and smiled ! She would not for worlds have begged any thing for herself — but for her father — oh ! she would have submitted to any degradation ! And then for a moment a gleam of something like happiness stole upon that hitherto mournful scene , as the father and daughter partook of their frugal — very frugal and sparing meal together . As soon as it was concluded , Ellen rose , kissed her parent affectionately , wished him "
206662	207066	207067	207068	my God	27430	" and retired into her own miserable , cold , and naked chamber . She extinguished her candle in a few moments , to induce her father to believe that she had sought repose ; but when she knew that the old man was asleep , she lighted the candle once more , and seated herself upon the old mattress , to embroider a few blossoms upon the silk which had been confided to her at the establishment in Finsbury . From the neighbouring houses the sounds of boisterous revelry fell upon her ears . She was too young and inexperienced to know that this mirth emanated from persons perhaps as miserable as herself , and that they were only drowning care in liquor , instead of encountering their miseries face to face . The din of that hilarity and those shouts of laughter , therefore made her sad . Presently that noise grew fainter and fainter ; and at length it altogether ceased . The clock of St. Luke 's church struck one ; and all was then silent around . A lovely moon rode high in the heavens ; the rain had ceased , and the night was beautiful — but bitter , bitter cold . Wearied with toil , the young maiden threw down her work , and , opening the casement , looked forth from her wretched chamber . The gentle breeze , though bearing on its wing the chill of ice , refreshed her ; and as she gazed upwards to the moon , she wondered within herself whether the spirit of her departed mother was permitted to look down upon her from the empyrean palaces on high . Tears — large tears trickled down her cheeks ; and she was too much overcome by her feelings even to pray . While she was thus endeavouring to divert her thoughts from the appalling miseries of earth to the transcendent glories of heaven , she was diverted from her mournful reverie by the sound of a window opening in a neighbouring house ; and in a few moments violent sobs fell upon her ears . Those sobs , evidently coming from a female bosom , were so acute , so heart - rending , so full of anguish , that Ellen was herself overcome with grief . At length those indications of extreme woe ceased gradually , and then these words—"Oh
207078	207110	206471	206471	Nell	1118	" fell upon Ellen 's ears . She was about to inquire into the cause of that profound affliction , when the voice of a man was heard to exclaim gruffly , "
207137	207447	207448	207448	I	0	" And then the window was closed violently . The workhouse ! That word sounded like a fearful knell upon Ellen 's ears . Oh ! for hours and hours together had that poor girl meditated upon the sad condition of her father and herself , until she had traced , in imagination , their melancholy career up to the very door of the workhouse . And there she had stopped : she dared think no more — or she would have gone mad , raving mad ! For she had heard of the horrors of those asylums for the poor ; and she knew that she should be separated from her father on the day when their stern destinies should drive them to that much - dreaded refuge . And to part from him — from the parent whom she loved so tenderly , and who loved her so well;—no — death were far preferable ! The workhouse ! How was it that the idea of this fearful home — more dreaded than the prison , less formidable than the grave — had taken so strong a hold upon the poor girl 's mind ? Because the former tenant of the miserable room which now was hers had passed thence to the workhouse : but ere she went away , she left behind her a record of her feelings in anticipation of that removal to the pauper 's home ! Impelled by an influence which she could not control — that species of impulse which urges the timid one to gaze upon the corpse of the dead , even while shuddering at the aspect of death — Ellen closed the window , and read for the hundredth time the following lines , which were pencilled in a neat hand upon the whitewashed wall of the naked chamber : — "
207455	207907	207450	207452	A TENDER MOTHER	6900	" Ellen read these lines till her eyes were dim with tears . She then retired to her wretched couch ; and she slept through sheer fatigue . But dreams of hunger and of cold filled up her slumbers;—and yet those dreams were light beside the waking pangs which realised the visions ! The young maiden slept for three hours , and then arose , unrefreshed , and paler than she was on the preceding day . It was dark : the moon had gone down ; and some time would yet elapse ere the dawn . Ellen washed herself in water upon which the ice floated ; and the cold piercing breeze of the morning whistled through the window upon her fair and delicate form . As soon as she was dressed , she lighted her candle and crept gently into her father 's room . The old man slept soundly . Ellen flung his clothes over her arm , took his boots up in her hand , and stole noiselessly back to her own chamber . She then brushed those garments , and cleaned those boots , all bespattered with thick mud as they were ; and this task — so hard for her delicate and diminutive hands — she performed with the most heart - felt satisfaction . As soon as this occupation was finished , she sate down once more to work . Thus that poor girl knew no rest ! ABOUT two months after the period when we first introduced Ellen Monroe to our readers , the old woman of whom we have before spoken , and who dwelt in the same court as that poor maiden and her father , was sitting at work in her chamber . The old woman was ill - favoured in countenance , and vile in heart . Hers was one of those hardened dispositions which know no pity , no charity , no love , no friendship , no yearning after any thing proper to human fellowship . She was poor and wretched;—and yet she , in all her misery , had a large easy chair left to sit upon , warm blankets to cover her at night , a Dutch clock to tell her the hour , a cupboard in which to keep her food , a mat whereon to set her feet , and a few turves burning in the grate to keep her warm . The walls of her room were covered with cheap prints , coloured with glaring hues , and representing the exploits of celebrated highwaymen and courtezans ; scenes upon the stage in which favourite actresses figured , and execrable imitations of Hogarth 's "
207912	208130	207450	207452	A TENDER MOTHER	6900	" The coverlid of her bed was of patchwork , pieces of silk , satin , cotton , and other stuffs , all of different patterns , sizes , and shapes , being sewn together — strange and expressive remnants of a vicious and faded luxury ! Upon the chimney - piece were two or three scent - bottles , which for years had contained no perfume ; and in the cupboard was a champagne - bottle , in which the hag now kept her gin . The pillow of her couch was stuffed neither with wool nor feathers — but with well - worn silk stockings , tattered lace collars , faded ribands , a piece of a muff and a boa , the velvet off a bonnet , and old kid gloves . And — more singular than all the other features of her room — the old hag had a huge Bible , with silver clasps , upon a shelf ! This horrible woman was darning old stockings , and stooping over her work , when a low knock at the door of her chamber fell upon her ear . That knock was not imperative and commanding , but gentle and timid ; and therefore the old woman did not hurry herself to say , "
208134	208213	207450	207452	A TENDER MOTHER	6900	" Even after the door had opened and the visitor had entered the room , the old hag proceeded with her work for a few moments . At length raising her head , she beheld Ellen Monroe . She was not surprised : but as she gazed upon that fair thin face whose roundness had yielded to the hand of starvation , and that blue eye whose fire was subdued by long and painful vigils , she said , "
208230	208231	208222	208222	I	0	" "
208238	208266	208269	208269	I	0	" exclaimed Ellen , surprised at these words , which appeared to contain a sense of dark and mysterious import that was ominous to the young girl . "
208274	208280	208269	208269	I	0	" repeated the old woman . "
208312	208313	208306	208306	you	0	" "
208321	208330	208317	208317	you	0	" said Ellen , with a bitter sigh . "
208358	208359	208345	208346	my father	2156	" "
208363	208390	208345	208346	my father	2156	" exclaimed the old woman , endeavouring to assume a soothing tone ; then , pointing to a foot - stool near her , she added , "
208406	208444	208445	208445	You	0	" Ellen really believed that she had excited a feeling of generous and disinterested sympathy in the heart of that hag ; and she therefore seated herself confidently upon the stool , saying at the same time , "
208477	208518	208455	208455	you	0	" The old woman glanced round to assure herself that the door of her cupboard was closed ; for in that cupboard were bread and meat , and cheese . Then , turning her eyes upwards , the hag exclaimed , "
208545	208640	208641	208641	You	0	" But when she had uttered these words , she cast her eyes upon the young girl who was now seated familiarly as it were , by her side , and scanned her from head to foot , and from foot to head . In spite of the wretched and scanty garments which Ellen wore , the admirable symmetry of her shape was easily descried ; and the old woman thought within herself how happy she should be to dress that sweet form in gay and gorgeous garments , for her own unhallowed purposes . "
208647	208651	208641	208641	You	0	" said Ellen . "
208673	208788	208641	208641	You	0	" The old hag 's countenance wore a singular expression when these last words fell upon her ears . Then she began to talk to the poor starving girl in a manner which the latter could not comprehend , and which we dare not describe . Ellen listened for some time , as if she were hearing a strange language which she was endeavouring to make out ; and then she cast a sudden look of doubt and alarm upon the old hag . The wretch grew somewhat more explicit ; and the poor girl burst into an agony of tears , exclaiming , as she covered her blushing cheeks with her snow - white hands—"No
208794	208894	208641	208641	You	0	" Still she did not fly from that den and from the presence of that accursed old hag , because she was so very , very wretched , and had no hope elsewhere . There was a long pause ; and the old hag and the young girl sate close to each other , silent and musing . The harridan cast upon her pale and starving companion a look of mingled anger and surprise ; but the poor creature saw it not — for she was intent only on her own despair . Suddenly a thought struck the hag . "
208912	208920	208905	208905	you	6906	" she said , after a while : "
208959	209017	209018	209018	I	0	" These words sounded upon the ears of the unhappy girl like a dream ; and parting , with her wasted fingers , the ringlets that clustered round her brow , she lifted up her large moist eyes in astonishment towards the face of the aged hag . But the old woman was serious in her offer . "
209030	209034	209018	209018	I	0	" she said . "
209051	209804	209805	209805	You	6915	" Ellen was literally stupefied by this strange proposal ; but when she had power to collect her ideas into one focus , she saw her father pining upon a bed of sickness , and surrounded by all the horrors of want and privation;—and she herself — the unhappy girl — had not tasted food for nearly thirty hours . Then , on the other side , was her innate modesty;—but this was nothing in the balance compared to the poignancy of her own and her parent 's sufferings . So she agreed to accompany the old hag to the house of the statuary in Leather Lane , Holborn . But first she hurried home to see if her father required any thing — a vain act of filial tenderness , for if he did she had nothing to give . The old man slept soundly — worn out with suffering , want , and sorrowful meditation ; and the landlady of the house promised to attend to him while Ellen was absent . The young maiden then returned to the old woman and they proceeded together to the house of the statuary . Up two flights of narrow and dark stairs , precipitate as ladders , did the trembling and almost heartbroken girl follow the hag . They then entered a spacious depository of statues modelled in plaster of Paris . A strange assembly of images was that ! Heathen gods seemed to fraternize with angels , Madonnas , and Christian saints ; Napoleon and Wellington stood motionless side by side ; George the Fourth and Greenacre occupied the same shelf ; William Pitt and Cobbett appeared to be contemplating each other with silent admiration ; Thomas Paine elbowed a bishop ; Lord Castlereagh seemed to be extending his hand to welcome Jack Ketch ; Cupid pointed his arrow at the bosom of a pope ; in a word , that strange pell - mell of statues was calculated to awaken ideas of a most wild and ludicrous character , in the imagination of one whose thoughts were not otherwise occupied . The statuary was an Italian ; and as he spoke the English language imperfectly , he did not waste much time over the bargain . With the cool criticism of a sportsman examining a horse or a dog , the statuary gazed upon the young maiden ; then , taking a rule in his hand , he measured her head ; and with a pair of blunt compasses he took the dimensions of her features . Giving a nod of approval , he consulted a large book which lay open upon a desk ; and finding that he had orders for a queen , an opera - dancer , and a Madonna , he declared that he would take three casts of his new model 's countenance that very morning . The old woman whispered words of encouragement in Ellen 's ear , as they all three repaired to the workshop , where upwards of twenty men were employed in making statues . Some were preparing the clay models over which the plaster of Paris was to be laid : others joined legs and arms to trunks;—some polished the features of the countenances : others effaced the seams that betrayed the various joints in the complete statues . One fixed wings to angels ' backs — another swords to warriors ' sides : a third repaired a limb that had been broken ; a fourth stuck on a new nose in the place of an old one knocked off . Ellen was stretched at full length upon a table ; and a wet cloth was placed over her face . The statuary then covered it with moist clay;—and the process was only complete when she was ready to faint through difficulty of breathing . She rested a little while ; and then the second cast was taken . Another interval to recover breath — and the third and last mould was formed . The statuary seemed well pleased with this trial of his new model ; and placing a sovereign in the young maiden 's hand , he desired her to return in three days , as he should require her services again . The poor trembling creature 's eyes glistened with delight as she balanced the gold in her little hand ; and she took her departure , accompanied by the hag , with a heart comparatively light . "
209813	209824	209805	209805	You	6915	" said the old woman , as they proceeded homewards : "
209846	210195	209834	209834	You	6915	" Ellen really felt grateful to the selfish harridan ; and having changed her gold for silver coin at a shop where she stopped to buy provisions , she counted ten shillings in the withered and sinewy hand which the hag thrust forth . Thus for three months did Ellen earn the means of a comfortable subsistence , by selling her countenance to the statuary . And that countenance might be seen belonging to the statues of Madonnas in catholic chapels ; opera dancers , and actresses in theatrical clubs ; nymphs holding lamps in the halls of public institutions ; and queens in the staircase windows of insurance offices . She never revealed to her father the secret spring of that improved condition which soon restored him to health ; but assured him that she had found more needle - work , and was well paid for it . The old man had too good an opinion of his daughter to suspect her of crime or frailty ; and he believed her innocent and well - meant falsehood the more readily , inasmuch as he saw her constantly engaged with her needle when he was at home . Three months passed away ; and already had a little air of comfort succeeded to the former dismal aspect of those two chambers which the father and daughter occupied , when the statuary died suddenly . Ellen 's occupation was once more gone ; and , after vainly endeavouring to obtain needle - work — for that which she did in the presence of her father was merely a pretence to make good her tale to him — she again repaired to the abode of the old hag who had introduced her to the statuary . The aged female was , if possible , more wrinkled and hideous than before ; the contrast between her and her fair young visitant was the more striking , inasmuch as the cheeks of the latter had recovered their roundness , and her form its plumpness by means of good and sufficient food . "
210203	210208	210196	210196	You	6917	" said the hag . "
210225	210226	210196	210196	You	6917	" "
210232	210236	210241	210241	him	31303	" returned Ellen , "
210267	210268	210246	210246	His	31303	" "
210281	210287	210272	210272	you	6917	" demanded the old woman . "
210296	210317	210318	210318	Your	6917	" Ellen heaved a deep sigh . The hag contemplated her for some time in silence , and then exclaimed , "
210386	210912	210376	210376	us	6926	" This proposal was far more agreeable to the maiden than the one which had led her into the service of the statuary ; and she did not for a moment hesitate to accompany the old woman to the abode of the artist . The great painter was about forty years of age , and dwelt in a splendid house in Bloomsbury Square . The rooms on the third floor were his studio , as he required a clear and good light . He accepted the services of Ellen Monroe as a copy , and remunerated the old woman out of his own pocket , for the introduction . But he required the attendance of his copy every day from ten till four ; and she was accordingly compelled to tell her father another story to account for these long intervals of absence . She now assured him that she was engaged to work at the residence of a family in Bloomsbury Square ; and the old man believed her . Her countenance having embellished statues , was now transferred to canvass . Her Grecian features and classic head appeared surmounted with the crescent of Diana , the helmet of Minerva , and the crown of Juno . The painter purchased dresses suitable to the characters which he wished her to adopt ; and , although she was frequently compelled to appear before him , in a state which at first was strongly repugnant to her modesty — with naked bust , and naked arms , and naked legs — the feeling of shame gradually wore away . Thus , though in body she remained pure and chaste , yet in soul was she gradually hardened to the sentiments of maiden delicacy and female reserve ! It is true that she retained her virtue — because it was not tempted . The artist saw not before him a lovely creature of warm flesh and blood ; he beheld nothing but a beautiful and symmetrical statue which served as an original for his heathen divinities and pastoral heroines . And in this light did he treat her . He paid her handsomely ; and her father and herself were enabled to remove to better lodgings , and in a more respectable neighbourhood , than those which had been the scene of so much misery in Golden Lane . The artist whom Ellen served was a portrait - painter as well as a delineator of classical subjects . When he was employed to paint the likeness of some vain and conceited West End daughter of the aristocracy , it was Ellen 's hand — or Ellen 's hair — or Ellen 's eyes — or Ellen 's bust — or some feature or peculiar beauty of the young maiden , in which the fashionable lady somewhat resembled her , that figured upon the canvass . Then when the portrait was finished , the artist would assemble his friends at the same time that the lady and her friends called to see it ; and the artist 's friends — well tutored beforehand — would exclaim , one , "
210919	210922	210376	210376	us	6926	" another , "
210927	210931	210376	210376	us	6926	" a third , "
210939	210943	210376	210376	us	6926	" a fourth , "
210946	211345	210376	210376	us	6926	profile!"—and so on . And all the while it was Ellen 's eye , or Ellen 's mouth , or Ellen 's hair , or Ellen 's profile , which the enthusiasts admired . Then the lady , flattering herself that she alone was the original , and little suspecting that the charms of another had been called in to enhance the beauty of her portrait , persuaded her fond and uxorious husband to double the amount of the price bargained for , and had the picture set in a very costly frame , to hang in the most conspicuous place in her mansion . It happened one day that the artist obtained the favour of a marchioness of forty - six by introducing into her portrait the nose , eyes , and mouth of that fair young maiden of seventeen . The great lady recommended him to the Russian Ambassador as the greatest of English painters ; and the ambassador immediately retained him to proceed to St. Petersburgh to transfer to canvass the physiognomy of the Czar . Ellen thus lost her employment once more ; and again did she repair to the den of the old hag who had recommended her to the statuary and the artist . The step of the maiden was less timid than formerly ; and her look was more confident . She was also dressed in a style which savoured of coquetry , for her occupation at the artist 's had taught her the value of her charms , and prompted her how to enhance them . She had imbibed the idea that her beauty was worth much , and should at least produce her a comfortable livelihood , even if it did not lay the foundation for a fortune . She therefore occupied all her leisure time in studying how to set it off to the greatest advantage . Thus dire necessity had compelled that charming young creature to embrace occupations which awoke all the latent female vanity that had slumbered in her bosom throughout the period of her pinching poverty , and that now shone forth in her manner — her gait — her glance — her speech — and her attire . The old hag observed this change , and was not surprised — for she was a woman of the world ; but she muttered to herself , "
211361	211362	211363	211363	I	0	" "
211371	211383	211368	211368	you	0	" said Ellen , seating herself without waiting to be asked . "
211399	211400	211392	211392	I	0	" "
211406	211412	211392	211392	I	0	" demanded the old hag . "
211419	211423	211392	211392	I	0	" replied Ellen . "
211430	211435	211437	211437	you	26653	" said the woman ; "
211459	211556	211437	211437	you	26653	" Ellen placed two sovereigns in the hand of the beldame ; and the old wretch opened her table drawer to search for something which she required . That drawer contained a strange incongruity of articles . Old valentine letters , knots of faded riband , cards , prophetic almanacs ; tooth powder boxes , and scented oil bottles , all alike empty ; the visiting cards of several noblemen and gentlemen , play - bills , theatrical journals , masquerade tickets never used , pieces of music , magazines of fashion , a volume of the "
211562	211575	211559	211560	Harriett Wilson	1130	" immoral prints , a song book , some leaves torn from the "
211579	211667	211559	211560	Harriett Wilson	1130	" medical drugs wrapped up in papers , a child 's caul , pieces of poetry in manuscript , amatory epistles on sheets of various tints , writs from the Court of Requests , summonses from police courts , & c. & c. The contents of that filthy drawer furnished a complete history of that old hag 's former life . The object of the old woman 's search was a card , which , having found it , she handed to the young maiden , saying , "
211707	212081	212082	212082	You	6932	" Ellen received the card , and hastened to Halkin Street , Belgrave Square , where the sculptor resided . She was shown first into a parlour upon the ground floor , then , when the object of her visit was made known , she was requested to walk up stairs to the studio of the great man . She found him contemplating with profound satisfaction a head which he had already cut from the top part of a block of marble . He was an old man of sixty , and he stooped in his gait ; but his eyes were dark and piercing . A bargain between the sculptor and Ellen was soon terminated ; and the next morning she entered upon her new employment . Stripped to the waist , she had to stand in a certain position , for several hours each day , in the presence of the sculptor . The old man laboured diligently at his statue , and allowed her little rest ; but he paid her munificently , and she was contented . The lady , whose statue was thus supposed to be in progress , called daily , and remained at the sculptor 's house for hours . She always came alone , and sate in the studio the whole time during which her call lasted : it was therefore imagined by all her friends that she really formed the model of the statue which was to bear her name . But Ellen 's neck — and Ellen 's shoulders — and Ellen 's bosom — and Ellen 's arms were in truth the pattern of the bust of that statue which was to be a great sculptor 's masterpiece , and to hand down the name of a great lady to posterity ! The very day upon which Ellen was to leave the sculptor 's employment , her services as a model being no longer required , this great lady happened to observe that she was in want of a nursery governess for her two young daughters . Ellen ventured to offer herself as a candidate for the situation . The lady raised her eyes and hands to heaven in astonishment , exclaiming , "
212113	212289	212293	212294	my child	6938	" And the lady was compelled to have recourse to her scent - bottle to save herself from fainting . She forgot that she would have herself stood to the sculptor if she had possessed a good bust ! The answer and the behaviour of this lady opened the eyes of Ellen to the nature of the opinion which the world must now form of her . She suddenly comprehended the real position which she occupied in society — about one remove above the unfortunate girls who were the avowed daughters of crime . Were she now to speak to the world of her virtue , that world would laugh insultingly in her face . Thus the dire necessity which had urged her upon this career , began by destroying her sense of female delicacy and shame : it now destroyed , in her estimation , every inducement to pursue a virtuous career . Again she sought the dwelling of the old hag : for the fourth time she demanded the assistance of the beldame . "
212296	212302	212316	212316	my	0	" said the old woman , "
212336	212337	212338	212338	You	6938	" "
212349	212359	212341	212341	I	0	" answered Ellen , with a smile of complacence ; "
212387	212388	212338	212338	You	6938	" "
212399	212437	212394	212394	you	6938	" exclaimed the old woman with a sigh — for she recalled to mind the pleasures and pursuits of her own youthful days , over which she retrospected with regret:—then , after a pause , she said , "
212443	212444	212441	212441	you	6938	" "
212450	212454	212441	212441	you	6938	" replied Ellen . "
212475	212476	212394	212394	you	6938	" "
212479	212494	212394	212394	you	6938	" ejaculated Ellen , laughing heartily , so as to display her brilliant teeth , "
212542	212547	212533	212533	I	0	later;"—and again she laughed . "
212572	212573	212564	212564	you	3159	" "
212588	212593	212578	212586	a French gentleman of science at the West End	6942	" answered the hag , "
212641	212642	212645	212645	his	6944	" "
212648	212652	212645	212645	his	6944	" said Ellen , "
212673	213568	212667	212667	you	3159	" The old woman once more had recourse to her filthy drawer , in which her present memoranda were mingled with the relics of the luxury of former days ; and taking thence a letter which she had only received that same morning , she tore off the address for the use of the young maiden . Ellen , who a few months previously had been accustomed to work for seventeen or eighteen hours without ceasing , now took a cab to proceed from the neighbourhood of St. Luke 's to Leicester Square . The French scientific experimentalist was at home ; and Ellen was conducted up four flights of stairs to a species of belvidere , or glass cabinet , built upon the roof of the house . The windows of this belvidere , and the paper with which the wood - work of the interior was covered , were of a dark blue , in order to mitigate the strength of the sun 's rays . Within this belvidere the Frenchman was at work . He was a short , middle - aged , sallow - faced , sharp - featured person — entirely devoted to matters of science , and having no soul for love , pleasure , politics , or any kind of excitement save his learned pursuits . He was now busily employed at a table covered with copper plates coated with silver , phials of nitric acid , cotton wool , pounce , a camera obscura , several boxes , each of about two feet square , and other materials necessary for photography . The Frenchman spoke English tolerably well ; and eyeing his fair visitant from head to foot , he expressed himself infinitely obliged to the person who had sent her . He then entered into particulars ; and Ellen found , to her surprise , that the photographer was desirous of taking full - length female portraits in a state of nudity . She drew her veil over her countenance , and was about to retire in disgust and indignation , when the Frenchman , who was examining a plate as he spoke , and therefore did not observe the effect his words had produced upon her , mentioned the price which he proposed to pay her . Now the artist paid better than the statuary ; the sculptor better than the artist ; and the photographer better than the sculptor . She therefore hesitated no longer ; but entered the service of the man of science . We shall not proceed to any details connected with this new avocation to which that lovely maiden lent herself . Suffice it to say , that having sold her countenance to the statuary , her likeness to the artist , and her bust to the sculptor , she disposed of her whole body to the photographer . Thus her head embellished images white and bronzed ; her features and her figure were perpetuated in divers paintings ; her bust was immortalized in a splendid statue ; and her entire form is preserved , in all attitudes , and on many plates , in the private cabinet of a photographer at one of the metropolitan Galleries of Practical Science . At length the photographer was satisfied with the results of his experiments regarding the action of light upon every part of the human frame ; and Ellen 's occupation was again gone . A tainted soul now resided in a pure body . Every remaining sentiment of decency and delicacy was crushed — obliterated — destroyed by this last service . Pure souls have frequently resided in tainted bodies : witness Lucretia after the outrage perpetrated upon her:—but here was essentially a foul soul in a chaste and virgin form . And what dread cause had consummated this sad result ? Not the will of the poor girl ; for when we first saw her in her cold and cheerless chamber , her mind was spotless at the Alpine snow . But dire necessity — that necessity which became an instrument in the old hag 's hands to model the young maiden to her purposes . For it was with ulterior views that the designing harridan had introduced the poor girl to that career which , without being actually criminal , led step by step towards criminality . The wretch knew the world well , and was enabled to calculate the influence of exterior circumstances upon the mind and the passions . After the first conversation which she had with Ellen , she perceived that the purity of the virgin was not to be undermined by specious representations , nor by dazzling theories , nor by delusive sophistry : and the hag accordingly placed the confiding girl upon a path which , while it supplied her with the necessaries of life , gradually presented to her mind scenes which were calculated to destroy her purity of thought and chastity of feeling for ever ! When Ellen left the service of the photographer , she repaired for the fifth time to the dwelling of the hag . The old woman was seated as usual at her work ; and she was humming to herself an opera air , which she remembered to have heard many — many years back . "
213577	213581	213569	213570	The Frenchman	6944	" said Ellen . "
213590	213591	213585	213585	you	6944	" "
213598	213604	213585	213585	you	6944	" answered the old woman , "
213631	213651	213652	213652	You	6944	" And the hag rocked herself backwards and forwards in her chair , as if overcome by painful reflections . "
213662	213668	213652	213652	You	6944	" observed Ellen , interrogatively . "
213752	213753	213740	213740	mother	3159	" "
213769	213781	213760	213760	you	3159	" inquired the hag , regarding Ellen fixedly in the face . "
213784	213792	213760	213760	you	3159	" answered the young maiden , lightly , "
213832	213844	213829	213830	the photographer	31473	" The old woman looked disappointed , and muttered to herself , "
213853	213854	213829	213830	the photographer	31473	" "
213862	213866	213867	213867	I	0	" inquired Ellen . "
213870	213883	213867	213867	I	0	" replied the hag , assuming a tone of kindness and conciliation , "
213911	213912	213900	213900	I	0	" "
213917	213921	213857	213857	you	0	" observed Ellen : "
213926	214539	214540	214540	My	0	" And she took her departure , downcast and disappointed , from the old hag 's abode . POVERTY once again returned — with all its hideous escort of miseries — to the abode of Monroe and his daughter . The articles of comfort which they had lately collected around them were sent to the pawnbroker : necessaries then followed to the same destination . Ellen no longer sought for needle - work : she had for some time past led a life which incapacitated her for close application to monotonous toil ; and she confidently reposed upon the hope that the old woman would procure her more employment with an artist or a sculptor . But at the expiration of the ten days , the hag put her off for ten days more ; and then again for another ten days . Thus a month passed away in idleness for both father and daughter , neither of whom earned a shilling . They could no longer retain the lodgings which they had occupied for some time in a respectable neighbourhood ; and now behold them returning to the very same cold , miserable , and cheerless rooms which we saw them occupying in the first instance , in the court leading out of Golden Lane ! What ups and downs constitute existence ! Two years had now passed away since we first introduced the reader to that destitute lodging in Golden Lane . We have therefore brought up this portion of our narrative , as well as all the other parts of it , to the close of the year 1838 . Misery , more grinding , more pinching , and more acute than any which they had yet known , now surrounded the father and daughter . They had parted with every thing which would produce the wherewith to purchase food . They lay upon straw at night ; and for days and days they had not a spark of fire in the grate . They often went six - and - thirty hours together without tasting a morsel of food . They could not even pay the pittance of rent which was claimed for their two chambers : and if it had not been for their compassionate neighbours they must have starved altogether . Monroe could obtain no employment in the City . When he had failed , during the time of Richard Markham 's imprisonment , he lost all his friends , because they took no account of his misfortunes , and looked only to the fact that he had been compelled to give up business . Had he passed through the Bankruptcy Court , and then opened his counting - house again to commence affairs upon credit , he would have found admirers and supporters . But as he had paid his creditors every farthing , left himself a beggar , and spurned the idea of entering upon business without capital of his own , he had not a friend to whom he could apply for a shilling . At length the day came when the misery of the father and the daughter arrived at an extreme when it became no longer tolerable . They had fasted for forty - eight hours ; and their landlady threatened to turn them out of their empty rooms into the street , unless they paid her the arrears of rent which they owed . They had not an article upon which they could raise the price of a loaf:—it was the depth of a cold and severe winter , and Ellen had already parted with all her under - garments . "
214544	214569	214540	214540	My	0	" said the heart - broken father , embracing his daughter affectionately , on the morning when their misery thus reached its utmost limit , "
214591	214592	214595	214595	you	0	" "
214597	214614	214595	214595	you	0	" inquired the daughter , anxiously glancing in the pale and haggard countenance of her sire . "
214625	214631	214632	214632	He	874	" said the old man . "
214656	214657	214649	214649	he	874	" "
214673	214682	214659	214659	you	0	" said the daughter , shaking her head . "
214694	214695	214701	214701	he	874	" "
214703	214709	214701	214701	he	874	" ejaculated the old man . "
214739	214740	214741	214741	God	880	" "
214749	214758	214759	214759	I	0	" cried Ellen , clasping her hands together . "
214776	214780	214759	214759	I	0	" added Monroe ; "
214839	214840	214837	214837	Greenwood	903	" "
214853	214857	214845	214845	you	0	" cried Ellen , "
214894	214895	214872	214872	He	903	" "
215015	215042	215043	215043	My	0	" With these words the old man embraced his daughter affectionately , and left the room . The moment he was gone Ellen said to herself , "
215266	215281	215263	215264	my God	27430	" she continued , clasping her hands together in an ebullition of intense agony ; "
215292	215304	215263	215264	my God	27430	" And straightway she proceeded to the dwelling of the old hag .
215350	215359	215361	215362	the woman	27628	" Miss Monroe is not come in yet , "
215365	215401	215361	215362	the woman	27628	" Here is the key of your lodgings — not that I think there is much worth the locking up . However , this key you do n't have again till my rent is paid . "
215402	215411	215413	215415	the old man	2222	" Here — pay yourself — pay yourself ! "
215869	215882	215861	215861	Ellen	1117	" My dear father , here is gold ! here is gold ! "
215883	215895	215897	215899	the old man	2222	" This then appears to be a day of good fortune , "
215906	215928	215897	215899	the old man	2222	" I also have gold — and these are the fruits of the first use which I have made of it ! "
215929	215932	215934	215934	Ellen	1117	" What ! "
215953	215958	215934	215934	Ellen	1117	" Richard Markham — — "
215959	215964	215966	215966	Monroe	1117	" Is an angel ! "
215968	215978	215966	215966	Monroe	1117	" He never will let us know want again ! "
215979	215985	215987	215987	Ellen	1117	" Oh ! my God ! "
216003	216025	215987	215987	Ellen	1117	" why did I not wait a few hours ? why did I not have patience and hope until your return ? "
216026	216034	216036	216038	the old man	2222	" Ellen , what mean those words ? "
216040	216047	216036	216038	the old man	2222	" speak — tell me — — "
216048	216055	216056	216056	she	1117	" Simply , my dear father , "
216078	216100	216056	216056	she	1117	" that I have consented to receive work at a price which will scarcely find us in bread ; and — — "
216101	216112	216114	216114	Monroe	1117	" You shall not hold to your bargain , dearest , "
216116	216178	216114	216114	Monroe	1117	" The money which you may have received in advance,—for you said , I think , that you had money,—shall be returned to those who would condemn you to a slavery more atrocious than that endured by the negroes in the West Indies ! Take courage my beloved Ellen — take courage : a brighter day will yet dawn upon us . "
216199	216204	216205	216205	he	5334	" My dearest daughter , "
216208	216280	216205	216205	he	5334	" you have no longer any hope ! I see by your looks that you despair ! God knows that we have encountered enough to teach us to place but little reliance upon the smiles of fortune : nevertheless , let us not banish hope altogether from our bosoms ! To - morrow we shall leave this dismal abode , and repair to the house of our young benefactor , Markham . "
216281	216284	216286	216286	Ellen	1117	" Markham ! "
216300	216314	216286	216286	Ellen	1117	" have you promised Mr. Richard Markham that we will reside with him ? "
216315	216364	216205	216205	he	5334	" Yes , dearest Ellen ; and in so doing I had hoped to give thee pleasure . You have known each other from infancy . Methinks I see thee now , a little child , climbing up that hill in company with Richard and his brother — — "
216365	216369	216371	216371	Ellen	1117	" His brother ! "
216382	216392	216394	216396	the old man	2222	" My dearest girl , you are not well , "
216410	216421	216407	216407	he	2222	" drink this , Ellen ; it will revive thee . "
218010	218016	218018	218020	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Well , my boy , "
218037	218050	218032	218033	the other	2054	Cracksman,—"well , my boy , do you feel equal to this undertaking ? "
218051	218054	218056	218056	Holford	1134	" Quite , "
218062	218070	218072	218073	the Cracksman	3270	" If we succeed , you know , "
218075	218139	218072	218073	the Cracksman	3270	" it will be a jolly good thing for you ; and if you happen to get nabbed , why — all the beaks can do to you will be to send you for a month or two upon the stepper . In that there case Tony and me will take care on you when you come out — won't we , Tony ? "
218140	218143	218160	218160	himself	3270	" Certainly , "
218147	218155	218156	218156	he	3270	Man.—"But if you get scented , Harry , "
218165	218249	218156	218156	he	3270	" as you approach the big house , you must have a run for it , and we shall stay here and leave the rope over the wall for two hours . If you do n't come back by that time , we shall suppose that you 've either got into some quiet corner of the palace , or that you 're taken ; and then , whichever happens of these two events , we sha n't be of any service to you . "
218250	218264	218266	218267	the Cracksman	3270	" One thing I should like you to bear in mind , youngster , "
218269	218325	218266	218267	the Cracksman	3270	" and that is , that if you do n't pluck up your courage well , and prepare for all kinds of dangers and difficulties , you 'd much better give up the thing at once . We do n't want you to run neck and heels into a business that you are afeard on . "
218326	218329	218331	218332	the youth	2012	" Afraid ! "
218336	218373	218331	218332	the youth	2012	" I shall not fail for want of courage . I have made up my mind to risk the venture ; and let the result be what it will , I shall go through with it . "
218374	218385	218387	218388	the burglar	2086	" That 's what I call speaking like a man , "
218390	218407	218387	218388	the burglar	2086	" though you are but a boy . Take a drop of brandy before you begin . "
218408	218413	218415	218415	Holford	1134	" Not a drop , "
218417	218433	218415	218415	Holford	1134	" I require a clear head and a quick eye , and dare not drink . "
218434	218441	218443	218444	the Cracksman	3270	" Well , as you will , "
218488	218493	218495	218495	Holford	1134	" I am ready , "
218497	218505	218495	218495	Holford	1134	" there is no use in delay . "
218506	218511	218513	218514	the Cracksman	3270	" Not a bit , "
218516	218530	218513	218514	the Cracksman	3270	" Tony and me will help you over the wall in a jiffey . "
218570	218574	218561	218561	he	2012	" Good night . "
218722	218727	218729	218730	the gardener	7126	" What was that ? "
218735	218740	218742	218743	the man	2092	" I heard nothing , "
218745	218756	218729	218730	the gardener	7126	" Yes — there was a rustling of those trees . "
218757	218763	218778	218779	the gardener	7126	" A cat , perhaps . "
218764	218772	218778	218779	the gardener	7126	" Or one of the aquatic birds . "
218878	218887	218889	218890	the man	2092	" Holloa ! who the devil is this ? "
218920	218937	218900	218900	he	2092	" I suppose you 're the new boy that the head - gardener hired this morning ? "
218938	218943	218945	218945	Holford	1134	" Yes , sir , "
218968	218983	218985	218986	the other	2054	" Then mind which way you go in future , young brocoli - sprout , "
219180	219189	219191	219191	one	2053	" Where did you say her majesty is ? "
219193	219201	219203	219204	the other	2054	" In the Roman drawing - room , "
219206	219231	219243	219243	he	27976	" The Sculpture Gallery is to be lighted up this evening . You can attend to that duty at once , if you will . "
219232	219236	219243	219243	he	27976	" Very well , "
222638	222653	222655	222655	one	2053	" The entertainment takes place in the Yellow and Roman Drawing Rooms this evening , "
222657	222666	222668	222669	the other	2054	" The prince is expected at five o'clock , "
222671	222693	222668	222669	the other	2054	" He and his father the Duke of Saxe Coburg Gotha , are to land at Woolwich between two and three . "
222694	222712	222655	222655	one	2053	" So I heard . The royal carriages have already left to meet her Majesty 's guests . "
222713	222721	222796	222797	The servants	2611	" Have you ever seen the prince ? "
222722	222744	222668	222669	the other	2054	" Once . He was in England , I remember , a short time previous to the accession of her Majesty . "
222745	222751	222655	222655	one	2053	" Is he good looking ? "
222752	222778	222796	222797	The servants	2611	" Very . Of course you believe as I do , and as every one else does that Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg will — — "
222779	222787	222668	222669	the other	2054	" Soon be Prince Albert of England . "
222788	222795	222655	222655	one	2053	" Hush ! walls have ears ! "
223191	223202	223204	223204	one	2053	" Well — what think you of the young prince ? "
223206	223215	223204	223204	one	2053	" Your grace was seated next to him . "
223216	223224	223166	223171	Two ladies attached to the court	7382	" Very handsome — and so unassuming , "
223229	223241	223166	223171	Two ladies attached to the court	7382	" Does your grace really believe that her Majesty is smitten ? "
223242	223262	223204	223204	one	2053	" No doubt of it . How fortunate for the family of the Grand Duke of Saxe - Coburg ! "
223263	223273	223204	223204	one	2053	" Yes — fortunate on the score of alliance . "
223274	223283	223166	223171	Two ladies attached to the court	7382	" And in a pecuniary point of view . "
223284	223342	223204	223204	one	2053	" Not so much as your grace thinks . There has been an absurd report in circulation that the grand duke 's revenues are so small , none of his family could venture to appear at the court of Vienna : and also , that the means of education for the younger branches were always excessively restricted . "
223343	223353	223204	223204	one	2053	" And are not these reports correct , countess ? "
223354	223507	223166	223171	Two ladies attached to the court	7382	" By no means . Your grace probably is aware that the earl and myself visited Germany the year before last ; and we remained six weeks at Gotha . The Duke of Saxe - Coburg possesses a considerable civil list , and a large private fortune . His brother Ferdinand espoused the wealthy Princess Kohary of Hungary ; and another brother , Leopold , married our lamented Princess Charlotte . It has been stated that Prince Leopold himself was a simple major in the Austrian service , with nothing but his pay , when he was fortunate enough to obtain the favour of the Princess Charlotte : this is so far from being correct , that he never was in the Austrian service at all , but was a general officer in the Russian army , enjoying , in addition to his full pay , a princely allowance from his country . "
223508	223519	223204	223204	one	2053	" Your ladyship has greatly pleased me with these elucidations . "
223520	223574	223204	223204	one	2053	" Your grace honours me with this mark of satisfaction . Prince Albert was educated at Bonn , on the Rhine . His mental qualifications are said to be of a very high order ; his disposition is amiable ; and he has obtained the affections of all who know him in Germany . "
223575	223597	223599	223600	the duchess	7385	" It is to be hoped that her most gracious Majesty will enjoy a long , prosperous , and happy reign , "
223609	223617	223619	223620	the countess	5273	" Long and prosperous it may be , "
223631	223652	223619	223620	the countess	5273	" but happy for her — happy for the sovereign whom we all so much love,—no — that is impossible ! "
223653	223663	223665	223666	the duchess	7385	" Alas ! I know to what you allude , "
223673	223689	223665	223666	the duchess	7385	" Merciful heavens ! is there , then , no perfect happiness in this world ? "
223690	223698	223700	223701	the countess	5273	" Where shall perfect happiness be found ? "
223716	223859	223700	223701	the countess	5273	" Never did any sovereign ascend the throne under more favourable circumstances than Victoria . Enshrined in a nation 's heart — beloved by millions of human beings,—wearing the proudest diadem in the universe , and swaying the sceptre of a dominion extensive as that of Rome , in her most glorious days,—oh ! why should not Victoria be completely happy ? Alas ! she can command the affections of her people by her conduct:—the valour of her subjects , the prowess of her generals , and the dauntless courage of her admirals , can preserve her empire from all encroachment — all peril;—wealth can surround her with every luxury , and all the potentates of the earth may seek her friendship;—but no power — no dominion — no wealth — no luxury — no love , can exterminate the seeds — — "
223860	223876	223665	223666	the duchess	7385	" Ah ! countess — for God 's sake , talk not in this manner ! "
223881	223899	223665	223666	the duchess	7385	" you make me melancholy — so melancholy , that I shall be dispirited the entire evening . "
223900	223932	223934	223935	the countess	5273	" Pardon me , my dear friend ; but I know not how our discourse gradually turned upon so sad a subject . And yet the transition must have been natural , "
223944	223964	223934	223935	the countess	5273	" for , most assuredly , I should not have voluntarily sought to converse upon so sad a theme . "
223965	223968	223970	223971	the duchess	7385	" Sad ! "
223973	224077	223970	223971	the duchess	7385	" ' tis sufficient to make one 's heart bleed . To think that a young creature whom millions and millions of beings idolize and adore — whose name is upon every lip — whose virtues and qualifications are the theme of every pen — whose slightest wish amounts to a command,—oh ! to think that this envied and amiable being should be haunted , day and night — alone , or when surrounded by all that is most noble or most lovely in England 's aristocracy,—haunted by that dread fear — that appalling alarm — that dismal apprehension;—oh ! it is intolerable ! "
224078	224081	224083	224084	the countess	5273	" Alas ! "
224086	224125	224083	224084	the countess	5273	" what poor — what miserable creatures are we ! The hand of the Deity mingles gall with the cup of nectar which is drunk by his elect ! There is no situation in life without its vexations . "
224126	224134	224136	224137	the duchess	7385	" Yes — vexations of all kinds ! "
224139	224161	224136	224137	the duchess	7385	" for those annoyances which are mere trifles to the lower classes , are grievous afflictions to us . But — — "
225131	225187	225196	225197	the duchess	7385	" How very awkward the viscount was last evening , my dear duchess . He would insist upon turning the pages for me when I sate at the grand pianoforte ; and he was always too soon or too late , although he pretended to read the fantasia which I played , bar by bar . "
225188	225194	225196	225197	the duchess	7385	" That is very provoking ! "
225199	225219	225196	225197	the duchess	7385	" I believe there is to be a Drawing - Room to - morrow , at St. James 's ? "
225220	225238	225196	225197	the duchess	7385	" Yes : your grace must have forgotten that her Majesty decided last evening upon holding one . "
225239	225258	225260	225261	the duchess	7385	" How many a young heart is fluttering now with anxiety and eager anticipation of to - morrow ! "
225263	225332	225260	225261	the duchess	7385	" A Drawing - Room is most formidable to the novice in court affairs . But the most entertaining portion of the embarrassment of the novice , is the fear that the gentleman who bears the name of the Court Circular , and who is invariably stationed in the Presence Chamber , may omit to mention her presence in the report which he draws up for the newspapers . "
225333	225350	225352	225353	the countess	5273	" George the Third and his consort held Drawing - Rooms weekly , for many years , "
225355	225456	225352	225353	the countess	5273	" George the Fourth held Drawing - Rooms but very seldom . William and Adelaide usually held about five or six in a season . And , after all , what can be more magnificent — what more eminently calculated to sustain the honour and dignity of the crown,[72 ] than a British Court Drawing - Room ? The tasteful dresses of the ladies — the blaze of diamonds — the waving ostrich plumes and lappets — the gold net — the costly tulle , constitute rather the characterstics of an oriental fiction than the reality of the present day . "
225457	225469	225471	225472	the duchess	7385	" The most magnificent Drawing - Rooms , in my opinion , "
225474	225528	225471	225472	the duchess	7385	" are those which we call Collar Days . The appearance of the Knights of the Garter , St. Patrick , the Thistle , the Cross and Bath , and all English orders , in their respective collars and jewels , in the presence of the sovereign , is splendid in the extreme . "
225529	225550	225552	225553	the countess	5273	" And how crowded upon Drawing - Room days are all the passages and corridors of St. James 's Palace , "
225555	225589	225552	225553	the countess	5273	" On the last occasion many of the peers and peeresses of the highest rank were compelled thus to wait for nearly three hours before their carriages could reach the palace - gates . "
225590	225639	225471	225472	the duchess	7385	" The most beautiful view of splendid equipages is found in a glance upon the Ambassador 's Court at Saint James 's , the carriages of the foreign ministers being decidedly the finest and most tasteful that are seen in the vicinity of the palace on those occasions . "
225640	225656	225700	225701	the duchess	7385	" Of a truth , this must be the most splendid court in the world , "
225659	225684	225471	225472	the duchess	7385	countess,—"since France became half republican ( how I hate the odious word Republic ! ) , and since Spain was compelled to copy France . "
225685	225698	225700	225701	the duchess	7385	" Yes — our court is the most splendid in the world , "
225727	225752	225720	225720	she	7385	" and more splendid still will it be when the queen shall have conferred her hand upon the interesting young prince who arrived yesterday . "
225753	225779	225471	225472	the duchess	7385	" Have you heard when the royal intentions to contract an union with his Serene Highness Prince Albert , will be communicated to the country ? "
225780	225829	225471	225472	the duchess	7385	" Not until the close of the year ; and the marriage will therefore take place at the commencement of 1840 . The prince will pay but a short visit upon this occasion , and then return to Germany until within a short period of the happy day . "
225830	225842	225844	225845	the countess	5273	" God send that the union may be a happy one ! "
225847	225851	225844	225845	the countess	5273	" But — — "
225852	225875	225877	225878	the duchess	7385	" Oh ! my dear friend , do not relapse again into those gloomy forebodings which rendered me melancholy all yesterday evening , "
225880	225911	225877	225878	the duchess	7385	" Alas ! your grace is well aware of my devoted attachment to our royal mistress ; and if there be times when I tremble for the consequences of — — "
225912	225925	225927	225928	the duchess	7385	" Breathe it not — give not utterance to the bare idea ! "
225939	225956	225927	225928	the duchess	7385	" Providence will never permit an entire empire to experience so great a misfortune as this ! "
225957	225965	225967	225968	the countess	5273	" Maladies of that kind are hereditary , "
225970	225997	225967	225968	the countess	5273	solemnly;—"maladies of that species descend through generations — unsparing — pitiless — regardless of rank , power , or position;—oh ! it is horrible to contemplate ! "
225998	226004	226006	226007	the duchess	7385	" Horrible — most horrible ! "
226009	226072	226006	226007	the duchess	7385	" The mind that thus labours under constant terror of the approach of that fearful malady , requires incessant excitement — perpetual change of scene ; and this restlessness which we have observed on the part of our beloved Sovereign — and those intervals of deep gloom and depression of spirits , when that craving after variety and bustle is not indulged — "
226073	226078	225967	225968	the countess	5273	" Are all — — "
226079	226088	225967	225968	the countess	5273	" Oh ! I comprehend you too well . "
226089	226098	226006	226007	the duchess	7385	" And marriage in such a case — — "
226099	226144	225967	225968	the countess	5273	" Perpetuates the disease ! Yes — yes — we must surround our sovereign with all our love , all our affection , all our devotion — for bitter , bitter are the moments of solitary meditation experienced at intervals by our adored mistress . "
226145	226155	226157	226158	the countess	5273	" Such is our duty — such our desire , "
226160	226180	226157	226158	the countess	5273	" The entire family of George the Third has inherited the seeds of disease — physical and mental — — "
226181	226186	226188	226189	the duchess	7385	" Scrofula and insanity , "
226196	226204	226206	226207	the countess	5273	" Which were inherent in that monarch , "
226209	226231	226206	226207	the countess	5273	" Did your grace ever hear the real cause and spring of that development of mental alienation in George the Third ? "
226232	226244	226246	226247	the duchess	7385	" I know not precisely to what incident your ladyship alludes , "
226249	226254	226256	226257	the countess	5273	" That unhappy sovereign , "
226259	226416	226256	226257	the countess	5273	" when Prince of Wales , fell in love with a beautiful young Quakeress , whose name was Hannah Lightfoot , and whom he first beheld at the window of a house in Saint James 's Street . For some time his Royal Highness and the young lady met in secret , and enjoyed each other 's society . At length the passion of the prince arrived at that point when he discovered that his happiness entirely depended upon his union with Hannah Lightfoot . His Royal Highness confided his secret to his next brother Edward , to Dr. Wilmot ( who was really the author of the letters of Junius ) , and to my mother . Those personages were the only witnesses of the legal marriage of the Prince of Wales with Hannah Lightfoot , which was solemnized by Dr. Wilmot , in Curzon Street Chapel , May Fair , in the year 1759 . "
226417	226427	226429	226430	the duchess	7385	" I have heard that such a connection existed , "
226432	226450	226429	226430	the duchess	7385	" but I never thought until now that it was of so serious and solemn a nature . "
226451	226519	226256	226257	the countess	5273	" Your grace may rely upon the truth of what I now tell you . Not long after the prince came to the throne , the Ministers discovered his connection with the Quakeress . The ' Royal Marriage Act ' was ultimately framed to prevent such occurrences with regard to future princes ; but it did not annul the union between George the Third and Hannah Lightfoot . "
226520	226529	226531	226532	the duchess	7385	" Was there any issue from this marriage ? "
226534	226539	226541	226542	the countess	5273	" There was issue , "
226554	226623	226541	226542	the countess	5273	" At my mother 's death I discovered certain papers which revealed to me many , many strange events connected with the court of George the Third ; and in which she was a confidant . But the history of Hannah Lightfoot is a sad one — a very melancholy one ; and positively can I assert that it led to the subsequent mental aberration of the king . "
226624	226638	226640	226641	the duchess	7385	" And there was issue resulting from that union , your ladyship says ? "
226649	226658	226660	226661	the countess	5273	" Yes — there was , there was ! "
226663	226713	226660	226661	the countess	5273	" But do not question me any more at present — on a future occasion I will place in the hands of your grace the papers which my deceased mother left behind her , and which I have carefully treasured up in secret — unknown even to my husband ! "
226714	226723	226725	226726	the duchess	7385	" And are the revelations so very interesting ? "
226728	226750	226752	226753	the countess	5273	" The events which have taken place in the family of George the Third would make your hair stand on end , "
226763	226781	226782	226782	she	5273	" But , pray — question me no more at present . Another time — another time , "
226786	226795	226782	226782	she	5273	" you shall know all that I know ! "
227229	227235	227237	227238	the latter	2065	" Well this is fortunate , "
227240	227246	227248	227248	Holford	1134	" What ! you here ! "
227256	227264	227266	227268	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Yes — certainly : why not ? "
227270	227329	227266	227268	the Resurrection Man	3220	" It struck me that as you never came near me and the Cracksman , you must be still in the royal crib ; and I considered that to be a sign that all was right . So I mustered up my courage , and came to look after you . The Cracksman 's waiting on the hill . "
227330	227339	227341	227341	Holford	1134	" Then let us leave this place immediately , "
227343	227384	227341	227341	Holford	1134	" We can do nothing at present — I was going to take my departure within an hour . Come — let us go ; and I will tell you every thing when we are in a place of security . "
227385	227393	227395	227397	the Resurrection Man	3220	" What 's the meaning of this ? "
227399	227419	227395	227397	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You ca n't have been here all this time without having found out where the plate is kept . "
227420	227426	227428	227428	Holford	1134	" Listen for one moment , "
227436	227493	227428	227428	Holford	1134	" the queen leaves for Windsor the day after to - morrow — then will be the time to do what you require ; and I can give you all the information you will want . At present nothing can be done — nothing ; and if we stay here much longer we shall be discovered . "
227494	227497	227499	227501	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Well , "
227503	227515	227499	227501	the Resurrection Man	3220	" provided that some good will result from your visit — — "
227516	227523	227428	227428	Holford	1134	" There will — there will . "
227524	227559	227560	227562	The Resurrection Man	3220	" Then I must follow your advice ; for of course you are better able to judge of what can be done and what ca n't be done in this crib , than me . "
227733	227737	227727	227740	The landlord and landlady of the " Boozing - Ken " on Saffron Hill	7506	" Boozing - Ken "
227759	227762	227798	227799	the landlord	2618	" all sorts "
227791	227796	227798	227799	the landlord	2618	" Well , Joe , "
227820	227828	227798	227799	the landlord	2618	" what news down at Cow Cross ? "
227829	227833	227835	227836	the man	2092	" Nothink partikler , "
227851	227937	227846	227849	a journeyman - knacker	7514	" We have been precious full of work lately — and that 's all I knows or cares about . Seventy - nine horses I see knocked down yesterday ; and out of them , fifty - three was so awful diseased and glandered when they was brought in , that we was obleeged to kill 'em and cut 'em up with masks and gloves on . It was but three weeks ago that we lost our best man , Ben Biddle:—you recollects Ben Biddle ? "
227938	227944	227946	227947	the landlord	2618	" I knowed him well , "
227949	227968	227946	227947	the landlord	2618	" He took his ' morning ' here reglar for sixteen years , and never owed a penny . "
227969	227978	227980	227981	the knacker	7516	" But do you know how he died ? "
227991	227999	227980	227981	the knacker	7516	" Ca n't say that I do . "
228000	228019	228021	228022	the knacker:—"he	31767	" He died of a fearful disease which is getting more and more amongst human creeturs every day , "
228022	228028	227980	227981	the knacker	7516	knacker:—"he died of the glanders ! "
228029	228033	228035	228036	the landlady	27841	" The glanders ! "
228050	228052	228076	228077	the knacker	7516	" morning "
228070	228074	228076	228077	the knacker	7516	" You see , "
228089	228254	228076	228077	the knacker	7516	" there is more diseased horses sold in Smithfield - Market than sound ' uns . The art of doctoring a dying horse so that he looks as lively and sound as possible to any one which ai n't wery knowing in them matters , is come to sich a pitch , that I 'm blowed if the wisest ai n't taken in at times . We have horses come into our yard that was bought the same morning in Smithfield , and seemed slap - up animals ; but in a few hours the effects of the stimulants given to 'em goes off , the plugs falls out of their noses , and there they are at the point of death . Why — if a horse has got four white feet , they 'll paint three , or perhaps all on 'em black ; and that part of the deception is n't never found out till they 're flayed in our yard . "
228255	228261	228263	228264	the landlord	2618	" But about poor Biddle ? "
228266	228276	228278	228279	the knacker	7516	" Well , in comes a horse one day , "
228281	228435	228278	228279	the knacker	7516	" and although we saw he was dead lame and altogether done up , we never suspected that he had the glanders . So Ben Biddle had the killing on him . He drives the pole - axe into the animal 's skull ; and he takes the wire and thrusts it into the brain as business - like as possible . While he was stooping over the beast , his hat falls off his head , and his handkerchief , which he always carried in his hat , fell just upon the horse 's mouth . The brute snorted out a last groan at the wery moment that Ben picks up his handkerchief . So Ben puts the handkerchief again into his hat , and puts his hat upon his head ; and away we all goes to the public - house to have a drop of half - and - half . "
228436	228441	228443	228447	the landlord who no doubt	7525	" Very right too , "
228451	228454	228456	228457	the knacker	7516	" Well , "
228459	228645	228456	228457	the knacker	7516	" Ben drinks his share , and presently he takes his handkerchief out of his hat quite permiscuous like , and wipes his face . In a few minutes he feels a strange pain in the eyes just as if some dust had got in;—but he did'nt think much on it , and so we all goes back to the yard . In a few hours Ben was taken so bad he was obliged to give up work ; and by eight or nine o'clock we was forced to take him to Bartholomew 's Hospital . He was seized with dreadful fits of womiting ; and matter come out of his nose , eyes , and month . By the morning his face was all covered over with sores ; holes appeared in his eyes , just for all the world as if they had got a most tremendous small - pox in 'em ; and his nose fell off . By three o'clock in the arternoon he was a dead man ; and I heerd say that he died in the most awful agonies . "
228646	228653	228655	228656	the landlady	27841	" And that was the glanders ? "
228658	228682	228655	228656	the landlady	27841	" Yes : he got 'em by wiping his face with the pocket - handkerchief that had fallen on the horse 's nostrils . "
228683	228687	228456	228457	the knacker	7516	" How shocking ! "
228692	228699	228701	228702	the landlord	2618	" And is the glanders increasing ? "
228704	228710	228712	228713	the knacker	7516	" The glanders is increasing , "
228715	228756	228712	228713	the knacker	7516	" and I feel convinced that it will soon become a disease as reglar amongst human beings as the small - pox or measles ; 'cos the authorities does n't do their duty in preventing the sale of diseased animals . "
228757	228766	228655	228656	the landlady	27841	" And how would you remedy the evil ? "
228767	228832	228655	228656	the landlady	27841	" I would have the Lord Mayor and Corporation appoint a proper veterinary surgeon as Inspector in Smithfield Market — a man of great experience and knowledge , who wo n't let himself be humbugged or gammoned by any of those infernal thieves that gets a living — aye , and makes fortunes too , by selling diseased animals doctored up for the occasion . "
228833	228845	228847	228848	the landlord	2618	" Yes — that 's certainly a capital plan of your'n , "
228851	228868	228847	228848	the landlord	2618	" But what becomes of all the flesh of the horses that go to your yards ? "
228869	228885	228887	228888	the man	2092	" You may divide the horses that 's killed by the knacker into three sorts , "
228890	229033	228887	228888	the man	2092	" that is — first , those horses that is quite healthy but that has met with accidents in their limbs ; second , those that is perhaps the least thing diseased , or in the wery last stage through old age ; and third , those that is altogether rotten . The flesh of the first is bought by men whose business it is to boil it carefully , and sell it to the sassage - makers : it makes the sassages firm , and is much better than beef . There is n't a sassage shop in London that do n't use it . Then the tongues of these first - rate animals goes to the butchers , who salts and pickles 'em : and I 'm blow'd if any one could tell 'em from the best ox - tongues . "
229034	229046	229048	229049	the landlady	27841	" Well , I 'll never eat sassages or tongues again ! "
229051	229061	229063	229064	the knacker	7516	" Oh ! nonsense — it 's all fancy ! "
229066	229112	229063	229064	the knacker	7516	" Half the tongues that is sold for ox - tongues is horses ' tongues . A knowing hand may always tell 'em , 'cos they 're rayther longer and thinner : for my part , I like 'em just as well — every bit . "
229113	229124	229340	229341	the landlady	27841	" And the flesh of the second sort of horses ? "
229125	229166	228887	228888	the man	2092	" That goes to supply the cat's - meat men in the swell neighbourhoods ; and the third sort , that is altogether putrid and rotten , is taken up by the cat's - meat men in the poor neighbourhoods . "
229167	229192	229194	229195	the landlord	2618	" And do you mean to say that there 's a difference even in cat's - meat between the rich and the poor customers ? "
229197	229205	229207	229208	the knacker	7516	" Do I mean to say so ? "
229225	229330	229216	229216	he	7516	" why , of course I do ! The poor may be pisoned — and very often is too — for what the rich cares a fig . I can tell you more too : some of the first class horses'-meat — the sound and good , remember — is made into what 's called hung - beef ; some is potted ; some is sold to the boarding - schools round London , where they takes in young gen'lemen and ladies at a wery low rate ; and some is disposed of — but , no — I do n't dare tell you — "
229331	229338	229340	229341	the landlady	27841	" Yes — do tell us ! "
229348	229357	229359	229360	the landlord	2618	" Do — there 's a good fellow , "
229362	229368	229370	229372	a dozen voices	7538	" Come , tell us , "
229374	229392	229394	229395	the knacker	7516	" No — no — I can't — I should get myself into a scrape , perhaps , "
229422	229430	229432	229433	the landlady	27841	" We wo n't say a word , "
229435	229446	229448	229449	the landlord	2618	" And I 'll stand a quartern of blue ruin , "
229451	229465	229448	229449	the landlord	2618	" with three outs — for you , me , and the missus . "
229466	229476	229478	229479	the knacker	7516	" Well — if I must , I must , "
229485	229490	229491	229491	he	7516	" The fact is , "
229505	229535	229497	229497	he	7516	" some of the primest bits of the first - rate flesh that goes out of the knackers ' yards of this wast metropolis is sent to the workuses ! "
229536	229540	229542	229543	the landlady	27841	" The workhouses ! "
229545	229552	229542	229543	the landlady	27841	" oh , what a horror ! "
229553	229557	229559	229560	the landlord	2618	" An abomination ! "
229570	229591	229593	229594	the knacker	7516	" It is God 's truth — and now that I 've said it , I 'll stick to it , "
229596	229606	229593	229594	the knacker	7516	" It 's a shame — a burning shame ! "
229612	229659	229593	229594	the knacker	7516	" My poor old mother 's in the Union , after having paid rates and taxes for forty - two year ; and if they make her eat horse 's flesh , I 'd like to know whether this country is governed by savages or not . "
229660	229670	229672	229676	a poor decrepit old man	7546	" And my brother 's in a workus too , "
229678	229736	229672	229676	a poor decrepit old man	7546	" and he once kept his carriage and dined in company with George the Third at Guildhall , where he 'd no end of turtle and venison . But , lack - a - daisy ! this is a sad falling off , if he 's to come down to horse - flesh in his old age . "
229737	229752	229754	229755	the knacker	7516	" What 's the use of all this here whining and nonsense , eh ? "
229757	229858	229754	229755	the knacker	7516	" Do n't I tell you that good horse - flesh answers all the purposes of beef , and is eaten by the rich in the shape of sassages and tongues ? What 's the use , then , of making a fuss about it ? How do you suppose the sassage - shops can afford to sell solid meat , without bone , at the price they do , if they did n't mix it with horses'-flesh ? They pays two - pence a - pound for the first - class flesh — and so it must be good . "
229859	229863	229865	229866	a voice	7548	" Never mind , "
229868	229918	229865	229866	a voice	7548	" it 's a shame to give paupers only a few ounces of meat a - week , and let that be horses'-flesh . It 's high time these things was put an end to . Why do n't the people take their own affairs in their own hands ? "
229919	229924	229926	229927	the knacker	7516	" Come , now , "
229940	230204	229936	229936	his	7516	" perhaps you ai n't aweer that good first - class horses'-flesh is better than half the meat that is sold in certain markets — I sha n't say which — for the benefit of the poor . Now you toddle out on Sunday night , on the Holloway , Liverpool , Mile End , and Hackney roads , and see the sheep , and oxen , and calves , coming into London for the next morning 's market . Numbers of the poor beasts fall down and die through sheer fatigue . They 're flayed and cut up all the same for the butcher 's market . And what do you think becomes of all the beasts that die of disease and so on , in the fields ? Do you suppose they 're wasted ? No such a thing ! They are all cut up too for consumption . Just take a walk on a Saturday night through a certain market , after the gas is lighted — not before , mind — and look at the meat which is marked cheap . You 'll see beef at two - pence half - penny a pound , and veal at three - pence . But what sort of stuff is it ? Diseased — rotten ! The butchers rub it over with fresh suet or fat , and that gives it a brighter appearance and a better smell . Howsomever , they ca n't perwent the meat from being quite thin , shrunk , poor , and flabby upon the bone . "
230205	230224	230226	230229	a butcher 's lad	7550	" I 'll bear witness to the truth of all wot you 've been saying this last time , "
230234	230240	230242	230243	the knacker	7516	" Of course you can , "
230252	230258	230259	230259	he	7516	" And do you know , "
230262	230360	230259	230259	he	7516	" that half the diseases and illnesses which takes hold on us without any wisible cause , and which sometimes puzzles the doctors themselves , comes from eating this bad meat that I 've been talkin ' about . Now , tell me — ain't a bit out of a good healthy horse , that was killed in a reg'lar way , with the blood flowing , better than a joint off a old cow that dropped down dead of the yallows in a field during the night , and was n't found so till the morning ? "
230399	230403	230404	230404	They	7555	" Boozing Ken . "
230425	230436	230438	230439	the Cracksman	3270	" He ai n't come yet , the young spark , "
230441	230464	230438	230439	the Cracksman	3270	" And yet he 's had plenty of time to go home and get a change o ' linen and that like . "
230465	230479	230481	230483	the Resurrection Man	3220	" May be he has turned into bed and had a good snooze , "
230485	230500	230481	230483	the Resurrection Man	3220	" He is not so accustomed to remain up all night as we are . "
230501	230590	230438	230439	the Cracksman	3270	" I think his head is rag'lar turned with what he has seen in the great crib yonder . He seemed to give sich exceeding wague answers to the questions we put to him as we walked through the park this morning . I 've heerd say that the conwersation of great people is wery gammoning , and that they ca n't always understand each other : so , if young Holford has been listening to their fine talk , it 's no wonder he 's got crankey . "
230591	230594	230481	230483	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Humbug ! "
230602	230665	230596	230598	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Let 's have some egg - flip , and we 'll wait for him . If he comes he shall give us all the information we want ; and if he does n't , we will lay wait for him , carry him off to the crib , and let the Mummy take care of him till he chooses to speak . "
230666	230675	230677	230678	the Cracksman	3270	" Yes — that'll be the best plan , "
230680	230702	230677	230678	the Cracksman	3270	" But do n't you think it 's a wery likely thing he wants to have the whole business to himself ? "
230703	230712	230714	230716	the Resurrection Man	952	" That 's just what I do think , "
230718	230731	230714	230716	the Resurrection Man	952	" he 'll find himself mistaken , though — I rather fancy . "
230732	230737	230739	230740	the Cracksman	3270	" So do I , "
230742	230752	230739	230740	the Cracksman	3270	" But let 's have this egg - flip . "
230810	230815	230817	230818	the Cracksman	3270	" Good stuff this , "
230824	230839	230817	230818	the Cracksman	3270	" I wonder whether poor Buffer has got anythink half so good this morning . "
230840	230851	230853	230855	the Resurrection Man	3220	" What 's to - day ? Oh ! Friday , "
230879	230895	230858	230858	he	3220	" let 's see — what 's the fare to - day in Clerkenwell Prison ? "
230896	230906	230908	230909	the Cracksman	3270	" Lord ! do n't you recollect all that ? "
230935	230947	230949	230951	the Resurrection Man	3220	" That 's a nice allowance for a strong healthy fellow ! "
230954	230988	230949	230951	the Resurrection Man	3220	" One month upon that will make his flesh as soft and flabby as possible . It 's a shame , by heavens ! to kill human beings by inches in that way ! "
230989	231001	231003	231004	the Cracksman	3270	" What a precious fool the Buffer has made of himself ! "
231009	231013	231003	231004	the Cracksman	3270	" The Buffer ! "
231048	231057	230949	230951	the Resurrection Man	3220	" is any thing wrong with the Buffer ? "
231058	231063	231065	231066	the Cracksman	3270	" Safe in lavender , "
231070	231081	231065	231066	the Cracksman	3270	" and ten to one he 'll swing for it . "
231082	231094	231096	231097	the waiter	2624	" My eyes ! I 'm very sorry to hear that , "
231099	231131	231096	231097	the waiter	2624	" He was a capital fellow , and never took the change when he gave me a joey[73 ] to pay for his three - penn'orth of rum of a morning . "
231132	231147	231149	231150	the Cracksman	3270	" Well , he 's done it brown at last , at all events , "
231152	231158	231160	231161	the waiter	2624	" What has he done ? "
231163	231179	231181	231182	the Cracksman	3270	" Why — what he is n't likely to have a chance of doing again , "
231184	231722	231181	231182	the Cracksman	3270	" I suppose you know that he married Moll Flairer , the sister of him as was killed by Bill Bolter at the Old House in Chick Lane , three years or so ago ? Well — he had a child by Moll ; and a very pretty little creetur it was . Even a fellow like me that ca n't be supposed to have much feeling for that kind of thing , used to love to play with that little child . It was a girl ; and I never did see such sweet blue eyes , and soft flaxy hair . The moment she was born , off goes the Buffer and subscribes to half a dozen burying clubs . The secretaries and treasurers was all exceedin ' glad to see him , took his tin , and put down his name . This was about two year ago . He kept up all his payments reg'lar ; and he was also precious reg'lar in keeping up such a system of ill - treatment , that the poor little thing seemed sinking under it . Now , as I said before , I 'm not the most remarkablest man in London for feeling ; but I 'm blow'd if I could n't have cried sometimes to see the way in which the Buffer and Moll would use that child . I 've seen it standing in a pail of cold water , stark naked , in the middle of winter , when the ice was floating on the top ; and because it cried , its mother would take a rope , half an inch thick , and belabour its poor back . Then they half starved it , and made it sleep on the bare boards . But the little thing loved its parents for all that ; and when the Buffer beat Moll , I 've seen that poor child creep up to her , and say in such a soft tone , ' Do n't cry , mother ! ' Perhaps all the reward it got for that was a good weltering . How the child stood it all so long , I ca n't say : the Buffer thought she never would die ; so he determined to put an end to it at once . And yet he did n't want money , for we had had some good things lately , what with one thing and another . All I know is that he first takes the little child and flings it down stairs ; he then puts it to bed , and sends his wife to the doctor 's for some medicine , and into the medicine he pours some laudanum . The little creature went to sleep smiling at him ; and never woke no more . This was two days ago . Yesterday the Buffer goes round to all the burying clubs , and gives notice of the death of the child . But some how or another the thing got wind ; one of the secretaries of a club takes a surgeon along with him to the Buffer 's lodgings , and all 's blown . "
231723	231737	231739	231740	the waiter	2624	" Well — I never heard of such a rig as that before , "
231742	231748	231750	231751	the Cracksman	3270	" As for the rig , "
231755	231869	231750	231751	the Cracksman	3270	" that is common enough . Ever since the burial societies and funeral clubs came into existence , nothink has been more common than these child - murders . A man in full work can very well afford to pay a few halfpence a - week to each club that he subscribes to , even supposing he puts his name down to a dozen . Then those that do n't kill their children right out , do it by means of exposure , neglect , and all kinds of horrible treatment ; and so it 's easy enough for a man to get forty or fifty pounds in this way at one sweep . "
231870	231879	231881	231882	the waiter	2624	" So it is — so it is , "
231884	232061	231881	231882	the waiter	2624	" burial clubs afford a regular premium upon the murder of young children . Ah ! London 's a wonderful place — a wonderful place ! Every thing of that kind is invented and got up first in London . I really do think that London beats all other cities in the world for matters of that sort . Look , for instance , what a blessed thing it is that the authorities seldom or never attempt to alter what they call the low neighbourhoods : why , it 's the low neighbourhoods that make such gentlemen as you two , and affords you the means of concealment , and existence , and occupation , and every thing else . Supposing there was no boozing - kens , and patter - cribs like this , how would such gentlemen as you two get on ? Ah ! London is a fine place — a very fine place ; and I hope I shall never live to see the day when it will be spoilt by improvement ! "
232062	232076	232078	232080	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Come , there 's a good deal of reason in all that , "
232082	232089	232090	232090	he	3220	" Here , my good fellow , "
232098	232111	232090	232090	he	3220	" drink this tumbler of egg - hot for your fine speech . "
232133	232149	232151	232153	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I never heard any thing more true than what that fellow has just said , "
232160	232265	232151	232153	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Only suppose , now , that all Saint Giles 's , Clerkenwell , Bethnal Green , and the Mint were improved , as they call it , where the devil would crime take refuge?—for no one knows better than you and me that we should uncommon soon have to give up business if we had n't dark and narrow streets to operate in , cribs like this ken to meet and plan in , and the low courts and alleys to conceal ourselves in . Lord ! what indeed would London be to us if it was all like the West - End ? "
232266	232297	232299	232300	the waiter	2624	" And so the fact is that the authorities very kindly leave in existence and undisturbed , those very places which give birth to you gentlemen in the first instance , "
232302	232308	232299	232300	the waiter	2624	" and sustain you afterwards . "
232309	232322	232324	232325	the Cracksman	3270	" Well , you ai n't very far wrong , old feller , "
232327	232340	232324	232325	the Cracksman	3270	" But , blow me , if this ever struck me before . "
232341	232347	232349	232351	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Nor me , neither , "
232353	232361	232349	232351	the Resurrection Man	3220	" till the flunkey started the subject . "
232362	232390	232397	232397	his	7591	" Ah ! there 's a many things that has struck me since I 've been in the waiter - line in flash houses of this kind , "
232401	232438	232397	232397	his	7591	" but one curious fact I 've noticed,—which is , that in nine cases out of ten the laws themselves make men take to bad ways , and then punish them for acting under their influence . "
232439	232446	232448	232449	the Cracksman	3270	" I do n't understand that , "
232451	232457	232459	232461	the Resurrection Man	952	" I do , though , "
232463	232530	232459	232461	the Resurrection Man	952	" and I mean to say that the flunkey is quite right . We ai n't born bad : something then must have made us bad . If I had been in the Duke of Wellington 's place , I should be an honourable and upright man like him ; and if he had been in my place , he would be — what I am . "
232531	232537	232539	232540	the waiter	2624	" Of course he would , "
232542	232547	232549	232550	the Cracksman	3270	" Now I understand , "
232552	232561	232563	232565	the Resurrection Man	952	" I tell you what we 'll do , "
232574	232643	232645	232647	the Resurrection Man	3220	" this devil of a Holford does n't appear to hurry himself , and the rain has just begun to fall in torrents;—so we 'll have another quart of flip , and the flunkey shall sit down with us and enjoy it ; and I will just tell you the history of my own life , by way of passing away the time . Perhaps you may find , "
232649	232688	232645	232647	the Resurrection Man	3220	" that it helps to bear out the flunkey 's remark , that in nine cases out of ten the laws themselves make us take to bad ways , and then punish us for acting under their influence . "
232728	233172	232721	232721	his	3220	" I was born thirty - eight years ago , near the village of Walmer , in Kent . My father and mother occupied a small cottage — or rather hovel , made of the wreck of a ship , upon the sea - coast . Their ostensible employment was that of fishing : but it would appear that smuggling and body - snatching also formed a portion of my father 's avocations . The rich inhabitants of Walmer and Deal encouraged him in his contraband pursuits , by purchasing French silks , gloves , and scents of him : the gentlemen , moreover , were excellent customers for French brandy , and the ladies for dresses and perfumes . The clergyman of Walmer and his wife were our best patrons in this way ; and in consequence of the frequent visits they paid our cottage , they took a sort of liking to me . The parson made me attend the national school regularly every Sunday ; and when I was nine years old he took me into his service to clean the boots and knives , brush the clothes , and so forth . I was then very fond of reading , and used to pass all my leisure time in studying books which he allowed me to take out of his library . This lasted till I was twelve years old , when my father was one morning arrested on a charge of smuggling , and taken to Dover Castle . The whole neighbourhood expressed their surprise that a man who appeared to be so respectable , should turn out such a villain . The gentlemen who used to buy brandy of him talked loudly of the necessity of making an example of him : the ladies , who were accustomed to purchase gloves , silks , and eau - de - cologne , wondered that such a desperate ruffian should have allowed them to sleep safe in their beds ; and of course the clergyman and his wife kicked me ignominiously out of doors . As all things of this nature create a sensation in a small community , the parson preached a sermon upon the subject on the following Sunday , choosing for his text ' Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar 's , and unto God the things that are God 's , ' and earnestly enjoining all his congregation to unite in deprecating the conduct of a man who had brought disgrace upon a neighbourhood till then famed for its loyalty , its morality , and its devotion to the laws of the country . "
233532	233683	233507	233510	the clergyman 's wife	7634	" Well , at that time my mother had got so thin , and weak , and ill , through want and affliction , that her neighbours gave her the name of the Mummy , which she has kept ever since . My father came home , and was shunned by every body . The baronet 's uncle happened to die at that period , and left his nephew an immense fortune:—the baronet paid all the fines , settled the Exchequer matters , and returned to Walmer . A triumphal reception awaited him : balls , parties , concerts , and routs took place in honour of the event;—and the mayor , the banker and the clergyman and his wife were held up as the patterns of philanthropy and humanity . Of course the baronet rewarded them liberally for having taken care of his children in the hour of need . "
233814	234042	233776	233780	a martyr to tyrannical laws	7643	" Up to this period , in spite of the contemplation of the lawless trade carried on by my father , I had been a regular attendant at church and at the Sunday - school ; and I declare most solemnly that I never went to sleep at night , nor commenced my morning 's avocations , without saying my prayers . But when my father got into trouble , the beadle kicked me out of church , and the parson drove me out of the school ; and so I began to think that if my religion was only serviceable and available as long as my father remained unharmed by the law , it could not be worth much . From that moment I never said another prayer , and never opened a bible or prayer - book . Still I was inclined to labour to obtain an honest livelihood ; and I implored my father , upon my knees , not to force me to assist in his proceedings of smuggling and body - snatching , to both which he was compelled by dire necessity to return the moment he was released from gaol . He told me I was a fool to think of living honestly , as the world would not let me ; but he added that I might make the trial . "
234211	234350	234191	234192	a seventh	7657	" Dispirited , but not altogether despairing , I returned home . On the following day , I walked into Deal , ( which almost joins Walmer ) and called at several tradesmen 's shops to inquire if they wanted an errand - boy . My reception by these individuals was worse than that which I had met with at the hands of the farmers . One asked me if I thought he would run the risk of having his house indicted as the receptacle for thieves and vagabonds;—a second pointed to his children , and said , ' Do you suppose I want to bring them up in the road to the gallows?'—a third locked up his till in affright , and threatened to call a constable;—and a fourth lashed me severely with a horse - whip . "
234511	234628	234487	234487	her	7665	" Finding that I had nothing to expect from the ladies , I tried the gentlemen who had been accustomed to patronise my father previous to his misfortune . The first swore at me like a trooper , and assured me that he had always prophesied I should go wrong:—the second spoke civilly , and regretted that his excellent advice had been all thrown away upon my father , whom he had vainly endeavered to avert from his wicked courses ( it was for smuggling things for this gentleman that my father had been arrested);—and the third made no direct answer , but shook his head solemnly , and wondered what the world was coming to . "
234765	235027	235028	235028	You	7684	" A sudden thought now struck me . I resolved to call next day upon the very baronet who had himself suffered so much in consequence of the customs - laws . Exhilarated by the new hope awakened within me , I repaired on the following morning to the splendid mansion which he now inhabited . I was shown into a magnificent room , where he received me , lounging before a cheerful fire . He listened very patiently to my tale , and then spoke , as nearly as I can recollect , as follows:—'My good lad , I have not the slightest doubt that you are anxious to eat the bread of honesty , as you very properly express it . But that bread is not within the reach of every body ; and if we were all to pick and choose in this world , my God ! what would become of us ? My dear young man , I occupy a prominent position amidst the gentry of these parts , and I have also a duty to fulfil towards society . Society has condemned you — unheard , I grant you : nevertheless , society has condemned you . Under these circumstances I have no alternative , but to decline taking you into my service ; and I must moreover request you to remember that if you are ever found loitering upon my grounds , I shall have you put in the stocks . I regret that my duty to society compels me thus to act . ' "
235426	235499	235384	235384	she	7698	" I returned home . ' Well , ' said my father , ' what luck this morning?'—'None , ' I replied.—'And what do you mean to do , lad?'—'To become a smuggler , a body - snatcher , or any thing else that you choose , ' was my reply ; ' and the sooner we begin , the better , for I am sick and tired of being good . ' "
235510	235731	235501	235501	I	0	" You have heard , perhaps , that Deal is famous for its boatmen and pilots . It is also renowned for the beauty of the sailors ' daughters . One of those lovely creatures captivated my heart — for I can even talk sentimentally when I think of those times ; and she seemed to like me in return . Her name was Katharine Price — Kate Price , as she was called by her acquaintance ; and a prettier creature the sun never shone upon . She was good and virtuous , too — and she alone understood my real disposition , which , even now that I had embarked in lawless pursuits , still panted to be good and virtuous also . At this time I was nineteen , and she was one year younger . We loved in secret — and we met in secret ; for her parents would not for one moment have listened to the idea of our union . My hope was to obtain a good sum of money by one desperate venture in the contraband line , and run away with Kate to some distant part of the country , where we could enter upon some way of business that would produce us an honest livelihood . This hope sustained us ! "
235831	236153	236154	236154	I	0	" Good luck attended upon my father and myself in respect to the body - snatching business . We raised thirty pounds ; and with that we set sail for France in the boat which we always hired for our smuggling expeditions . We landed at Calais , and made our purchases . We bought an immense quantity of brandy at tenpence a quart ; gloves at eightpence a pair ; three watches at two pound ten each ; and some eau - de - cologne , proportionately cheap . Our thirty pounds we calculated would produce us a hundred and twenty . We put out to sea again at about ten o'clock at night . The wind was blowing stiff from the nor'-east ; and by the time we had been an hour at sea it increased to a perfect hurricane . Never shall I forget that awful night . The entire ocean was white with foam ; but the sky above was as black as pitch . We weathered the tempest until we reached the shore about a mile to the south'ard of Walmer , at a place called Kingsdown . We touched the beach — I thought every thing was safe . A huge billow broke over the stem of the lugger ; and in a moment the boat was a complete wreck . My father leapt on shore from the bow at the instant this catastrophe took place : I was swallowed up along with the ill - fated bark . I was , however , an excellent swimmer ; and I combated , and fought , and struggled with the ocean , as a man would wrestle with a savage animal that held him in his grasp . I succeeded in gaining the beach ; but so weak and enfeebled was I that my father was compelled to carry me to our hovel , close by . "
236184	236440	236154	236154	I	0	" At length I got well . But what hope remained for me ? We were totally ruined — so was the poor fisherman whose boat was wrecked upon that eventful night . I wrote a note to Kate to tell her all that had happened , and to make an appointment for the following Sunday evening , that we might meet and talk over the altered aspect of affairs . Scarcely had I despatched this letter to the care of Kate 's sister - in - law , who was in our secret , and managed our little correspondence , when my father came in and asked me if I felt myself well enough to accompany him on a little expedition that evening . I replied in the affirmative . He then told me that a certain surgeon for whom we did business , and who resided in Deal , required a particular subject which had been buried that morning in Walmer Churchyard . I did not ask my father any more questions ; but that night I accompanied him to the burial - ground between eleven and twelve o'clock . The surgeon had shown my father the grave in the afternoon ; and we had a cart waiting in a lane close by . The church is in a secluded part , surrounded by trees , and at some little distance from any habitations . There was no danger of being meddled with:—moreover , we had often operated in the same ground before . "
236859	236923	236840	236840	I	0	" The surgeon and my father did not notice my emotions , but settled their accounts . The medical man then offered us each a glass of brandy . I drank mine with avidity , and then accompanied my father from the spot — uncertain whether to rush back and claim the body , or not . But I did not do so . "
237136	237286	237123	237123	he	26709	" Next day I was arrested and taken before a magistrate . The baronet appeared against me , and — to my surprise — swore that I had assaulted him with a view to rob him , and that he had the greatest difficulty in protecting his purse and watch . I told my story and showed the mark of the baronet 's whip across my face . The justice asked me if I could bring forward my witnesses to character . The baronet exclaimed , ' How can he ? he has been in Dover Castle for smuggling . '—'Never ! ' I cried emphatically.—'Well , your father has , then , ' said the baronet . This I could not deny.—'Oh ! that 's just the same thing ! ' cried the magistrate ; and I was committed to gaol for trial at the next Maidstone assizes . "
237364	237646	237355	237355	you	7735	" I was tried , and found guilty . The next two years of my life I passed at the hulks at Woolwich , dressed in dark grey , and wearing a chain round my leg . Even there I did not grow so corrupted , but that I sought for work the moment I was set at liberty again . I resolved not to return home to my parents , for I detested the ways into which they had led me . Turned away from the hulks one fine morning at ten o'clock , without a farthing in my pocket nor the means of obtaining a morsel of bread , my prospects were miserable enough . I could not obtain any employment in Woolwich : evening was coming on — and I was hungry . Suddenly I thought of enlisting . Pleased with this idea , I went to the barracks , and offered myself as a recruit . The regiment stationed there was about to embark for the East Indies in a few days and wanted men . Although certain of being banished , as it were , to a most unhealthy climate for twenty - one years , I preferred that to the life of a vagabond or a criminal in England . The sergeant was delighted with me , because I could read and write well ; but the surgeon would not pass me . He said to me , ' You have either been half - starved for a length of time , or you have undergone a long imprisonment , for your flesh is as flabby as possible . ' Thus was this hope destroyed . "
237751	238067	238092	238093	the strong	7741	" Well — that night I wandered into the country and slept under a hedge . On the following morning I was compelled to satisfy the ravenous cravings of my hunger with Swedish turnips plucked from the fields . This food lay so cold upon my stomach that I felt ready to drop with illness , misery , and fatigue . And yet , in this Christian land , even that morsel , against which my heart literally heaved , was begrudged me . I was not permitted to satisfy my hunger with the food of beasts . A constable came up and took me into custody for robbing the turnip field . I was conducted before a neighbouring justice of the peace . He asked me what I meant by stealing the turnips ? I told him that I had fasted for twenty - four hours , and was hungry . ' Nonsense , hungry ! ' he exclaimed ; ' I 'd give five pounds to know what hunger is ! you kind of fellows eat turnips by way of luxury , you do — and not because you 're hungry . ' I assured him that I spoke the truth.—'Well , why do n't you go to work ? ' he demanded.—'So I will , sir , with pleasure , if you will give me employment , ' I replied.—'Me give you employment , ' he shouted ; ' I would n't have such a fellow about me , if he 'd work for nothing . Where did you sleep last night?'—'Under a hedge , sir , ' was my answer.—'Ah ! I thought so , ' he exclaimed : ' a rogue and vagabond evidently . ' And this excellent specimen of the ' Great unpaid ' committed me forthwith to the treadmill for one month as a rogue and vagabond . "
238158	238436	238441	238441	I	0	" I had been two years at the hulks , and was not hardened : I had been a smuggler and a body - snatcher , and was not hardened:—but this one month 's imprisonment and spell at the treadmill did harden me — and hardened me completely ! I could not see any advantage in being good . I could not find out any inducement to be honest . As for a desire to lead an honourable life , that was absurd . I now laughed the idea to scorn ; and I swore within myself that whenever I did commence a course of crime , I would be an unsparing demon at my work . Oh ! how I then detested the very name of virtue . ' The rich look upon the poor as degraded reptiles that are born in infamy and that can not possibly possess a good instinct , ' I reasoned within myself . ' Let a rich man accuse a poor man before a justice , a jury , or a judge , and see how quick the poor wretch is condemned ! The aristocracy hold the lower classes in horror and abhorrence . The legislature thinks that if it does not make the most grinding laws to keep down the poor , the poor will rise up and commit the most unheard - of atrocities . In fact the rich are prepared to believe any infamy which is imputed to the poor . ' It was thus that I reasoned ; and I looked forward to the day of my release with a burning — maddening — drunken joy ! "
238603	238704	238705	238705	I	0	" The very first thing I did was to cut myself a good tough ash stick with a heavy knob at one end . The next thing I did was to break into the house of the very justice who had sentenced me to the treadmill for eating a raw turnip ; and I feasted jovially upon the cold fowl and ham which I found in his larder . I also drank success to my new career in a bumper of his fine old wine . This compliment was due to him : he had made me what I was ! "
239010	239119	239120	239120	I	0	" And the upper classes wonder that there are so many incendiary fires : my only surprise is , that there are so few ! Ah ! the Lucifer - match is a fearful weapon in the hands of the man whom the laws , the aristocracy , and the present state of society have ground down to the very dust . I felt all my power — I knew all my strength — I was aware of all my importance as a man , when I read of the awful extent of misery and desolation which I had thus caused . Oh ! I was signally avenged ! "
239287	239395	239284	239284	my	0	" Not many hours elapsed before I set fire to the largest barn upon the baronet 's estate . I waited in the neighbourhood and glutted myself with a view of the conflagration . The damage was immense . The next day I composed a song upon the subject , which I have never since forgotten . You may laugh at the idea of me becoming a poet ; but you know well enough that I received some trifle of education — that I was not a fool by nature — and that in early life I was food of reading . The lines were these : — "
239401	239492	239284	239284	my	0	" The baronet suspected that I was the cause of the fire , as I had just returned to the neighbourhood ; and he had me arrested and taken before a justice ; but there was not a shadow of proof against me , nor a pretence to keep me in custody . I was accordingly discharged , with an admonition ' to take care of myself'—which was as much as to say , ' If I can find an opportunity of sending you to prison , I will . ' "
239552	239559	239548	239550	the old Mummy	1075	" I need say no more . "
239560	239576	239578	239584	the waiter of the boozing - ken	7782	" And there 's enough in your history to set a man a - thinking , "
239586	239591	239578	239584	the waiter of the boozing - ken	7782	" there is indeed . "
239592	239602	239604	239605	the Cracksman	3270	" Ah ! I b'lieve you , there is , "
239635	239641	239643	239644	the Cracksman	3270	" Well , young blade , "
239646	239659	239643	239644	the Cracksman	3270	" you have n't kept us waiting at all , I suppose ? "
239660	239682	239684	239685	the lad	28865	" And do you fancy that I could wake myself up again in a minute when I had once laid down ? "
239689	239700	239702	239703	the Cracksman	3270	" Oh ! bother to the laying down , Harry , "
239705	239741	239702	239703	the Cracksman	3270	" Do n't you think me and Tony wants sleep as well as a strong hearty young feller like you ? and we have n't put buff in downy[74 ] since the night afore last . "
239742	239751	239753	239755	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Well , never mind chaffing about that , "
239768	239854	239765	239765	he	3220	" Now , about this business at the palace ? We must have no delay ; and when we make appointments in future , they must be better kept . But I wo n't speak of this one now , because there 's some allowance to be made for you , as you were up the best part of the night , and you ai n't accustomed to it as we are . But to the point . How is this affair to be managed ? "
239855	239869	239871	239871	Holford	1134	" I do n't see how it is to be managed at all , "
239875	239882	239884	239885	the Cracksman	3270	" The devil you do n't , "
239887	239900	239884	239885	the Cracksman	3270	" Then what was you doing all that time in the palace ? "
239901	239914	239953	239955	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Running a thousand risks of being found out every minute — — "
239915	239923	239953	239955	the Resurrection Man	3220	" So we all do at times . "
239924	239936	239884	239885	the Cracksman	3270	" And sneaking about at night - time to find food . "
239937	239951	239953	239955	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I think you managed to discover the right place for the grist , "
239965	239978	239957	239957	his	3220	" for you must recollect that I found you in the pantry . "
239979	240000	240002	240003	the Cracksman	3270	" And the pantry 's a good neighbourhood : it ca n't be far from where the plate 's kept , "
240005	240018	240020	240020	Holford	1134	" The plate is kept where no one can get at it , "
240022	240031	240020	240020	Holford	1134	" How do you know that , youngster ? "
240032	240068	239957	239957	his	3220	" I overheard the servants count it , lock it up in a chest , and take it up to the apartments of — of — the Lord Steward , I think they call him . "
240069	240073	240075	240076	the Cracksman	3270	" The deuce ! "
240085	240097	240099	240101	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Now I tell you what it is , young fellow , "
240103	240117	240099	240101	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I think that for some reason or another you 're deceiving us . "
240118	240123	240125	240126	the lad	28865	" You think so ? "
240128	240140	240125	240126	the lad	28865	" And why should you fancy that I am deceiving you ? "
240141	240149	240099	240101	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Because your manners tell me so . "
240150	240155	240157	240157	Holford	1134	" In that case , "
240164	240180	240157	240157	Holford	1134	" it is not of any use for us to talk more upon the subject . "
240181	240194	240196	240197	the Cracksman	3270	" By G — d , it is of use , though ! "
240199	240212	240214	240214	he	3270	" You shall tell us the truth by fair means or foul ; "
240252	240266	240268	240270	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Now , you see that it is no use to humbug us , "
240272	240324	240268	240270	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Tell us the whole truth , and you will of course get your reg'lars out of the swag . You told me that the Queen was going to Windsor in a day or two ; and that was as much as to say that the affair would come off then . "
240325	240343	240345	240345	Holford	1134	" I told you the Queen was going to Windsor — and I tell you so again , "
240347	240376	240345	240345	Holford	1134	" But I ca n't help it if they lock up the plate : and I do n't know what else there is for you to carry off . "
240440	240449	240451	240452	the Cracksman	3270	" Now , Holford , my good fellow , "
240468	240493	240451	240452	the Cracksman	3270	" if you fancy that you are able to go through this business alone , and without any help , you 're deucedly mistaken . "
240494	240501	240503	240503	Holford	1134	" I imagine no such thing , "
240505	240562	240503	240503	Holford	1134	" and to prove to you that I am convinced there is nothing to be got by the affair , in any shape or way , do you and Tidkins attempt it alone together . He found his way to the pantry as well as I did , and can tell you what he saw there . "
240563	240568	240570	240572	the Resurrection Man	3220	" That 's true , "
240580	240595	240570	240572	the Resurrection Man	3220	" So I suppose we must give the thing up as a bad job ? "
240596	240602	240604	240605	the Cracksman	3270	" I suppose we must , "
240611	240643	240608	240608	his	3270	" But , by G — d , if I thought this younker was humbugging us , I 'd plant three inches of cold steel in him , come what would . "
240644	240651	240653	240653	Holford	1134	" Thank you for your kindness , "
240660	240680	240681	240681	he	3220	" Another time , get some person to act for you whose word you will believe . And now , "
240690	240720	240681	240681	he	3220	" please to recollect the terms we agreed upon — a third of all we could get if successful , or five pounds for me in case of failure . "
240721	240730	240732	240734	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Well , I shall keep my word , "
240736	240745	240747	240748	the Cracksman	3270	" Blow me if I would , though , "
240752	240761	240763	240765	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Yes — fair play 's a jewel , "
240785	240826	240827	240827	he	3220	" Holford is entitled to his five pounds , and he shall have them ; but , curse me ! if I have enough in my pocket to pay him . I tell you what it is , my lad , "
240836	240853	240827	240827	he	3220	" you must meet me somewhere this evening , and I 'll give you the money . "
240854	240859	240861	240861	Holford	1134	" That will do , "
240863	240870	240861	240861	Holford	1134	" Where shall I meet you ? "
240871	240874	240876	240878	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Where ? "
240887	240907	240876	240878	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Oh ! I will tell you . You know the Dark - House in Brick Lane , Spitalfields ? "
240908	240920	240861	240861	Holford	1134	" I have heard of it , but was never there . "
240921	240936	240938	240940	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Well — meet me there to - night at nine o'clock , Harry , "
240952	240962	240938	240940	the Resurrection Man	3220	" and I 'll tip you the five couters . "
240963	240968	240970	240970	Holford	1134	" At nine punctually , "
240972	241113	240970	240970	Holford	1134	" I would not press you , but I have lost my place in consequence of being absent all this time without being able to give any account of myself ; and so I am regularly hard up . I 'm going to look after a situation up somewhere beyond Camden Town this afternoon , that I heard of by accident : but I am afraid I shall not get it , as I can give no reference for character;—and even if I could , it would be to the public - house where I was pot - boy , and the place I 'm going to try for is to clean boots and knives , and make myself generally useful in a gentleman 's house . So I am afraid that I am not likely to get the situation . "
241114	241127	241129	241131	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I hope you may , my lad , for your sake , "
241133	241163	241129	241131	the Resurrection Man	3220	" At all events the five quids will keep you from starving for the next two months to come ; so mind and be punctual this evening at nine . "
241164	241170	241172	241172	Holford	1134	" I shall not fail , "
241181	241199	241201	241202	the Cracksman	3270	" Well , blow me , if I can make out now what you 're up to , "
241217	241239	241241	241243	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You never thought that I should be fool enough to give him five coolers for doing nothing but humbug us ? "
241245	241322	241241	241243	the Resurrection Man	3220	" No — no : catch a weasel asleep — but not Tony Tidkins ! Do n't you see that he has been making fools of us ? I remember what a devil of a hurry he was in to get me away from the palace , when I lighted upon him in the pantry , and , altogether , I am convinced he has been doing his best to stall us off from the business . "
241323	241328	241330	241331	the Cracksman	3270	" So I think , "
241333	241336	241330	241331	the Cracksman	3270	" Well , "
241342	241424	241338	241340	the Resurrection Man	3220	" we 'll just try what a few days of the pit under the staircase in my crib will do for him . I have mended up the hole that opens into the saw - pit next door ; and there is no chance of his escaping . We must make him drink a glass at the Dark House , and drug the grog well , and we need n't fear about being able to get him up into my street . "
241425	241433	241435	241436	the Cracksman	3270	" Ah ! now I understand you , "
241438	241463	241435	241436	the Cracksman	3270	" only see what it is to have a head like your'n . The pit will soon make him tell us the real truth . "
241464	241474	241476	241478	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And if not — if he remains obstinate — "
241480	241486	241476	241478	the Resurrection Man	3220	aloud;—"why — in that case — "
241487	241497	241499	241500	the Cracksman	3270	" We shall know what to do with him , "
241765	241768	241769	241771	The Countess Alteroni	1163	" Richmond . "
241792	241822	241773	241773	her	1163	" The countess expresses her most sincere thinks for a communication which prevented an arrangement that , under the circumstances disclosed , would have proved a serious family calamity . "
241823	241830	241832	241832	Markham	874	" Yes — Isabella is saved ! "
241857	241975	241976	241976	Richard	874	" it is impossible to mistake the meaning of that last sentence . She is saved — and I have been the instrument of her salvation ! I have rescued her from an union with a profligate , an adventurer , a man of infamous heart ! Surely — surely her parents will admit that I have paid back a portion of the debt of gratitude which their kindness imposed upon me ! Yes — the countess herself seems to hold out a hope of reconciliation;—that note bids me hope ! It is more than coldly polite — it is confidential:—it gives me to understand the results of my own letter denouncing the miscreant George Montague Greenwood . "
242003	242010	242011	242011	he	874	" Enthusiastic visionary that I am ! "
242016	242075	242011	242011	he	874	" I construe common politeness into a ground of hope : I fancy that every bird I see — however ill - omened — is a dove of promise , with an olive - branch in its mouth ! Alas ! mine is a luckless fate — and God alone can tell what strange destinies yet await me . "
242194	242201	242202	242202	she	1117	" Do I intrude , Richard ? "
242205	242243	242202	242202	she	1117	" I knocked twice at the door ; and not receiving any reply , imagined that there was no one here . I came to change a book . But you — you are thoughtful and depressed . "
242244	242261	242263	242263	Markham	874	" I was meditating upon a topic which to me is always fraught with distressing ideas , "
242265	242273	242263	242263	Markham	874	" I was thinking of my brother ! "
242274	242278	242280	242280	Ellen	1117	" Your brother ! "
242289	242292	242294	242294	Richard	874	" Yes , "
242301	242348	242294	242294	Richard	874	" I would rather know the worst — if misfortunes have really overtaken him — than remain in this painful state of suspense . If he be prosperous , why should he stay away ? if poor , why does he not seek consolation with me ? "
242349	242352	242354	242354	Ellen	1117	" Perhaps , "
242358	242381	242354	242354	Ellen	1117	" perhaps he is — in reality — much better off than — than — any one who feels interested in him . "
242382	242386	242388	242388	Markham	874	" Heaven knows ! "
242390	242421	242388	242388	Markham	874	" But ere now you observed that I was melancholy and dispirited ; and I have told you wherefore . Ellen , I must make the same charge against you . "
242422	242426	242428	242430	the young lady	4262	" Against me ! "
242448	242454	242456	242456	Richard	874	" Yes , against you , "
242463	242504	242456	242456	Richard	874	" You may think that I am joking — but I never was more serious in my life . For the few days that you have been in this house , you have been subject to intervals of profound depression . "
242505	242508	242510	242510	Ellen	1117	" I ! "
242532	242537	242539	242539	Richard	874	" Alas ! Ellen , "
242541	242650	242539	242539	Richard	874	" I have myself been too deeply initiated in the mysteries of adversity and sorrow,—I have drunk too deeply of the cup of affliction,—I have experienced too much bitter , bitter anguish , not to be able to detect the presence of unhappiness in others . And by many signs , Ellen , have I discovered that you are unhappy . I speak to you as a friend — I do not wish to penetrate into your secrets;—but if there be any thing in which I can aid you — if there be aught wherein my poor services or my counsels may be rendered available,—speak , command me ! "
242651	242656	242658	242658	Ellen	1117	" Oh ! Richard , "
242666	242693	242658	242658	Ellen	1117	" how kind — how generous of you thus to think of me — you who have already done so much for my father and myself ! "
242694	242752	242539	242539	Richard	874	" Were you not the companion of my childhood , Ellen ? and should I not be to you as a brother , and you to me as a sister ? Let me be your brother , then — and tell me how I can alleviate the weight of that unhappiness which is crushing your young heart ! "
242753	242757	242759	242759	Ellen	1117	" A brother ! "
242764	242792	242800	242800	she	1117	" yes — you shall — you must be a brother to me ! And I will be your sister ! Ah ! there is consolation in that idea!"—then
242803	242857	242800	242800	she	1117	" But the time is not yet come when I , as a sister , shall appeal to you as a brother for that aid which a brother alone can give ! And until then — ask me no more — speak to me no farther upon the subject — I implore you ! "
242912	242920	242922	242924	the old butler	26551	" A young lad , Master Richard , "
242926	242995	242922	242924	the old butler	26551	" has called about the situation which is wacated in our household . I took the percaution of leaving word yesterday with the people at a public of most dubitable respectability called the Servants ' Arms , where I call now and then when I go into town ; and it appears that this young lad having called in there quite perspicuously this morning heard of the place . "
242996	243004	243006	243006	Markham	874	" Let him step in , Whittingham , "
243008	243033	243006	243006	Markham	874	" I will speak to him — although , to tell you the truth , I do not admire a public - house recommendation . "
243046	243058	243034	243034	Whittingham	881	" Step in here , young man ; step in here . "
243073	243087	243089	243089	Holford	1134	" I believe you are in want of a young lad , sir , "
243091	243098	243089	243089	Holford	1134	" to assist in the house . "
243099	243103	243105	243105	Markham	874	" I am , "
243107	243117	243105	243105	Markham	874	" Have you over served in that capacity before ? "
243118	243158	243089	243089	Holford	1134	" No , sir ; but if you would take me and give me a trial , I should feel very much obliged . I have neither father or mother , and am totally dependant upon my own exertions . "
243204	243215	243105	243105	Markham	874	" What have you been before , my good lad ? "
243216	243225	243105	243105	Markham	874	" To tell you the truth , sir , "
243230	243245	243105	243105	Markham	874	" I have been a simple pot - boy in a public - house . "
243246	243258	243105	243105	Markham	874	" And of course the landlord will give you a character ? "
243259	243271	243105	243105	Markham	874	" Yes — for honesty and industry , sir ; but — "
243272	243276	243105	243105	Markham	874	" But what ? "
243277	243298	243105	243105	Markham	874	" I do not think it is of any use to apply to the landlord for a character , because — "
243299	243303	243305	243305	Markham	874	" Because what ? "
243315	243343	243305	243305	Markham	874	" If you can have a character for honesty and industry , you need not be afraid of any thing else that could be said of you . "
243344	243351	243353	243353	Holford	1134	" The truth is , sir , "
243355	243411	243353	243353	Holford	1134	" I absented myself without leave , and remained away for two or three days : then , when I returned this morning at a very early hour I refused to give an account of my proceedings . That is the whole truth , sir ; and if you will only give me a trial — "
243412	243423	243425	243425	Markham	874	" There is something very straightforward and ingenuous about you , "
243427	243445	243425	243425	Markham	874	" perhaps you would have no objection to tell me how you were occupied during your absence . "
243446	243472	243474	243474	Holford	1134	" That , sir , is impossible ! But I declare most solemnly that I did nothing for which I can reproach myself — unless , "
243476	243502	243474	243474	Holford	1134	" it was in leading a couple of villains to believe that I would do a certain thing which I never once intended to do . "
243503	243511	243513	243513	Richard	874	" Really your answers are so strange , "
243515	243566	243513	243513	Richard	874	" that I know not what to say to you . It however appears from your last observation that two villains tempted you to do something wrong — that you lead them to believe you would fall into their plans — and that you never meant to fulfil your promise . "
243567	243620	243474	243474	Holford	1134	" It is all perfectly true , sir . They proposed a certain scheme in which I was to be an agent : I accepted the office they assigned to me , because it suited my disposition , and promised to gratify my curiosity in a way where it was deeply interested . "
243621	243638	243640	243640	Richard	874	" And how did you explain your conduct to the two men whom you speak of ? "
243663	243671	243673	243673	Holford	1134	" I invented certain excuses , sir , "
243677	243729	243673	243673	Holford	1134	" which completely damped their ardour in the matter alluded to . And now , sir , will you give me a trial ? I feel convinced you will : had I not thought so from the very beginning , I should not have spoken so freely as I have done . "
243730	243746	243748	243748	Markham	874	" I am disposed to assist you — I am desirous to meet your wishes , "
243750	243786	243748	243748	Markham	874	" Still , your representations are rather calculated to awaken fears than clear up doubts concerning you . What guarantee can you offer that you will never see those two villains again ? what security — "
243787	243790	243792	243792	Holford	1134	" Sir , "
243794	243843	243792	243792	Holford	1134	" your own manner is so frank and kind — so very condescending , indeed , to a poor lad like me — that I would not deceive you for the world . I had promised to meet those men to - night — for the last time — "
243844	243850	243748	243748	Markham	874	" To meet them again ? "
243851	243868	243748	243748	Markham	874	" Yes , sir — to receive the reward promised for the service which I undertook — "
243869	243875	243877	243877	Markham	874	" Ah ! young man , "
243879	243900	243877	243877	Markham	874	" this is most imprudent — if not actually criminal ! and where was this precious interview to take place ? "
243901	243910	243748	243748	Markham	874	" At the Dark - House , sir — "
243911	243917	243919	243919	Markham	874	" The Dark - House ! "
243921	243933	243919	243919	Markham	874	" what — a low tavern in Brick Lane , Spitalfields ? "
243934	243940	243748	243748	Markham	874	" The same , sir . "
243941	243950	243952	243952	Richard	874	" And the names of the two men ? "
243955	243976	243978	243978	Holford	1134	" Their right names and those by which they are commonly known amongst their own set , are very different , "
243980	243996	243998	243998	Markham	874	" How are they known ? what are they called in their own infamous sphere ? "
244008	244011	244000	244000	his	874	" speak ! "
244012	244024	244026	244026	Holford	1134	" I do not know whether I shall be doing right , "
244028	244037	244026	244026	Holford	1134	hesitating,—"perhaps I have already told you too much — "
244038	244044	244046	244046	Richard	874	" Speak , I say ! "
244057	244120	244046	244046	Richard	874	" speak . You do not know — you can not guess how necessary it is for me to have my present suspicions cleared up ! Speak — I swear no harm shall happen to you : on the contrary — I will reward you , if it should turn out as I suppose . Once more , who are these villains ? "
244121	244126	244164	244164	Markham	874	" They are called — "
244127	244134	244046	244046	Richard	874	" What ? speak — speak ! "
244135	244140	244046	244046	Richard	874	" The Resurrection Man — "
244141	244144	244164	244164	Markham	874	" Ah ! "
244145	244150	244046	244046	Richard	874	" And the Cracksman . "
244151	244162	244164	244164	Markham	874	" Then I am right — my suspicions are confirmed ! "
244181	244203	244176	244176	himself	874	" Sit down , my good lad — sit down : you and I have not done with each other yet . "
244247	244317	244230	244230	Richard	874	" Sit down — and fear nothing . I swear most solemnly that no harm shall happen to you , be you who or what you may : for I can not suppose that you are a participator in the crimes of these miscreants . You would not have come to me to tell me all this — Oh ! no ; Providence has sent you hither this day . "
244332	244360	244362	244362	Richard	874	" Are you aware of the pursuits of those two men whom you have named — I mean the full extent of the atrocity of their pursuits ? "
244371	244385	244387	244387	Holford	1134	" I know that they are body - snatchers and burglars , sir , "
244389	244440	244387	244387	Holford	1134	" indeed it was a burglary of which they would have made me the instrument ; but , oh ! sir — believe me , I am incapable of such a crime ; and the representations I have made to them have induced them to abandon all idea of it . "
244441	244450	244452	244452	Richard	874	" And you are not aware , then , "
244454	244466	244452	244452	Richard	874	" that they are more than body - snatchers and burglars ? "
244467	244472	244474	244474	Holford	1134	" More , sir ! "
244482	244497	244474	244474	Holford	1134	" Oh ! no , sir — how can they be more than that ? "
244498	244506	244508	244508	Markham	874	" They are more — far more , "
244514	244519	244508	244508	Markham	874	" they are murderers ! "
244520	244523	244525	244525	Holford	1134	" Murderers ! "
244539	244553	244555	244555	Markham	874	" Yes — murderers of the most diabolical and cold - blooded description , "
244557	244619	244555	244555	Markham	874	" But it is too long a tale to tell you now . Let it suffice for you to know that I was myself upon the point of becoming a victim to that most infernal of all miscreants , the Resurrection Man ; and I should conceive that the other whom you named is in all respects as bad as he ! "
244620	244623	244625	244625	Holford	1134	" Murderers ! "
244652	244655	244657	244657	Markham	874	" Murderers , "
244660	244672	244657	244657	Markham	874	" and through you must they be surrendered up to justice ! "
244673	244677	244679	244679	Holford	1134	" Through me ! "
244681	244716	244679	244679	Holford	1134	" Yes — through you . If you be really imbued with such honourable feelings as you ere now professed , you will not hesitate for one moment in discharging this duty towards society . "
244717	244731	244733	244733	Holford	1134	" But it would be an odious act of treachery on my part , "
244735	244744	244733	244733	Holford	1134	" let the men be what they may . "
244745	244760	244762	244762	Markham	874	" If you manifest such a reluctance to rid the metropolis of two murderers , "
244765	244925	244762	244762	Markham	874	" I shall conceive that you are more intimately connected with them than you choose to admit . But if you imagine that these villains are more innocent than I describe them — if you fancy that some motive prompts me to exaggerate their infamy , I will tell you that no language can enhance their guilt — no vengeance be too severe . Have you not heard that men have disappeared in a most strange and mysterious manner within the last year , at the eastern end of the metropolis,—disappeared without leaving a trace behind them,—men who were not in that situation which hurries the despairing wretch on to suicide ? You must have heard of this ! If not , learn the dismal fact now from my lips ! But the assassins — the dark and secret assassins of these numerous victims , are the wretches whom we shall this night lodge in the grasp of justice ! "
244926	244933	244935	244935	Holford	1134	" As you will , sir , "
244955	244978	244935	244935	Holford	1134	" I was to meet them at the Dark - House at nine o'clock : do you take measures to secure them . "
244979	244985	244987	244987	Markham	874	" Most assuredly I will , "
244990	245007	245009	245009	Richard	874	" And when I think of all that you have told me , my good lad , "
245011	245029	245009	245009	Richard	874	" I am inclined to believe that you yourself would have been a victim to those wretches . "
245030	245033	245035	245035	Holford	1134	" Me ! "
245045	245076	245035	245035	Holford	1134	" Yes — such is now my conviction . They made an appointment with you at the Dark - House , to give you a sum of money you say ? "
245077	245082	245009	245009	Richard	874	" Yes , sir . "
245083	245173	245035	245035	Holford	1134	" Foolish boy ! Do such men pay their agents or accomplices who fail to fulfil their designs , or who deceive them ? do such men part with their money so readily — that money which they encounter so many perils to obtain ? And that Dark - House — the place of your appointment,—that Dark - House is in the immediate neighbourhood of the head - quarters of their crimes ! Yes — there can not be a doubt : you also were to be a victim ! "
245174	245186	245188	245188	Holford	1134	" My God ! what a fearful danger have I incurred ! "
245253	245266	245268	245268	Markham	874	" You say that the hour of meeting is fixed for nine ? "
245277	245464	245268	245268	Markham	874	" Yes , sir ; and now let me thank you with the most unfeigned sincerity for having thus saved me from a dreadful death . Your kindness and condescension have led to a lengthy conversation between us ; and accident has made me reveal to you those particulars which have led you to form that conclusion relative to the fate destined for myself . You must not imagine for a moment that I would league with such villains in any of their diabolical plans . No , sir — I would sooner be led forth to the place of execution this minute . Although I consented to do their bidding in one respect , I repeat that I had mine own curiosity to gratify — that is , my own inclinations to serve : but when they wished to make me their instrument and tool in forwarding their unholy motives , I shrank back in dismay . Oh ! yes , sir — now I comprehend the entire infamy of those men 's characters : I see from what a fearful abyss I have escaped . "
245526	245537	245539	245539	Markham	874	" The gang may be more numerous than I imagine , "
245541	245586	245539	245539	Markham	874	" indeed , I know that there are a third man and hideous woman connected with those two assassins whom you have already named . It will therefore be advisable to lay such a trap that will lead to the capture of them all . "
245587	245596	245598	245598	Holford	1134	" Oh ! by all means , sir , "
245602	245614	245598	245598	Holford	1134	" I do not wish to show them any mercy now ! "
245615	245629	245631	245631	Markham	874	" We have no time to lose : it is now four o'clock , "
245633	245654	245631	245631	Markham	874	" and we must arrange the plan of proceeding with the police . You will accompany me on this enterprise . "
245655	245659	245539	245539	Markham	874	" Mr. Markham , "
245667	245761	245661	245661	Holford	1134	" I have no objection to aid you in any shape or way in capturing these miscreants , and rooting out their head quarters ; but I must beg of you not to place me in a position where I shall be questioned how I came to make this appointment for to - night with those two wretches . It would compel me to make a revelation of the manner in which I employed my time during the last few days ; and that — for certain reasons — I could not do ! "
245768	245781	245782	245782	he	874	" I do not see how your presence can be dispensed with , "
245791	245829	245782	245782	he	874	" In order to discover the exact spot where the murderers dwell , it will be advisable for you to allow yourself to be inveigled thither , and myself and the police would be close behind you . "
245830	245839	245841	245841	Holford	1134	" Oh ! never — never , sir ! "
245847	245880	245841	245841	Holford	1134	" Were you to miss us only for a moment — or were you to force an entrance a single instant too late — my life would be sacrificed to those wretches . "
245881	245886	245888	245888	Markham	874	" True — true , "
245890	245985	245888	245888	Markham	874	" it would be too great a risk in a dark night — in narrow streets , and with such desperadoes as those . No — I must devise some other means to detect the den of this vile gang . But first of all I must communicate with the police . You can remain here until my return . To - morrow inquiry shall be made relative to your honesty and industry ; and , those points satisfactorily ascertained , I will take you into my service , without asking any farther questions . "
246427	246429	246411	246420	several women in the parlour of the Dark - House	7896	" blowens "
246760	246770	246793	246793	herself	7928	" Now , come , tell us , Joe , "
246804	246817	246793	246793	herself	7928	heaver,—"tell us , Joe , how you come to be a prig ? "
246818	246831	246793	246793	herself	7928	" Ah ! do , Joe — there 's a good feller , "
246841	246849	246851	246852	the man	2092	" Lor ' it 's simple enough , "
246857	246868	246851	246852	the man	2092	" every poor devil must become a thief in time . "
246869	246878	246880	246881	the Cracksman	3270	" That 's what you say , Tony , "
246887	246893	246895	246898	the coal - heaver	7932	" Of course he must , "
246900	246938	246895	246898	the coal - heaver	7932	" more partickler them as follows my old trade — for though I 've got on the togs of a whipper , I ai n't one no longer . The dress is convenient — that 's all . "
246939	246950	246952	246957	the woman with the domino teeth	7933	" The Blue - bottles do n't twig — eh ? "
246959	247150	246952	246957	the woman with the domino teeth	7933	" That 's it : but you asked me how I come to be a prig — I'll tell you . My father was a coal - whipper , and had three sons . He brought us all up to be coal - whippers also . My eldest brother was drownded in the pool one night when he was drunk , after only drinking about two pots of the publicans ' beer : my other brother died of hunger in Cold - Bath Fields prison , where he was sent for three months for taking home a bit of coal one night to his family when he could n't get his wages paid him by the publican that hired the gang in which he worked . My father died when he was forty — and any one to have seen him would have fancied he was sixty - five at least — so broke down was he with hard work and drinking . But no coal - whipper lives to an old age : they all die off at about forty — old men in the wery prime of life . "
247151	247157	247159	247163	the large - toothed lady	7934	" And why 's that ? "
247165	247169	247171	247172	the man	2092	" Why not ? "
247174	247215	247171	247172	the man	2092	" Because a coal - whipper is n't a human being — or if he is , he is n't treated as such : and so I 've always thought he must be different from the rest of the world . "
247216	247227	246952	246957	the woman with the domino teeth	7933	" How is n't he treated like any one else ? "
247228	247399	246952	246957	the woman with the domino teeth	7933	" In the first place , he does n't get paid for his labour in a proper way . Wapping swarms with low public - houses , the landlords of which act as middle - men between the owners of the colliers and the men that 's hired to unload 'em . A coal - whipper ca n't get employment direct from the captain of the collier : the working of the collier is farmed by them landlords I speak of ; and the whipper must apply at their houses . Those whippers as drinks the most always gets employment first ; and whether a whipper chooses to drink beer or not , it 's always sent three times a - day on board the colliers for the gangs . And , my eye ! what stuff it is ! Often and often have we throwed it away , 'cos we could'nt possibly drink it — and it must be queer liquor that a coal - whipper wo n't drink ! "
247400	247411	247171	247172	the man	2092	" I should think so too . But go on . "
247412	247479	246952	246957	the woman with the domino teeth	7933	" Well , I used to earn from fifteen to eighteen shillings a - week ; and out of that , eight was always stopped for the beer ; and if I did n't spend another or two on Saturday night when I received the balance , the landlord set me down as a stingy feller and put a cross agin my name in his book . "
247480	247486	246952	246957	the woman with the domino teeth	7933	" What was that for ? "
247487	247563	247171	247172	the man	2092	" Why , not to give me any more work till he was either forced to do so for want of hands , or I made it up with him by standing a crown bowl of punch . So what with one thing and another , I had to keep myself , my wife , and three children , on about seven or eight shillings a - week — after working from light to dark . "
247564	247576	247578	247583	the woman with the huge teeth	7936	" And now your wife and children is better purvided for ? "
247585	247594	247596	247597	the man	2092	" Yes — indeed ! in the workus , "
247601	247663	247596	247597	the man	2092	" So now you see what a coal - whipper 's life is . He ca n't be a sober man if he wishes to — because he must pay for a certain quantity of drink ; and so of course he wo n't throw it away , unless it 's so bad he ca n't keep it on his stomach . "
247664	247672	247171	247172	the man	2092	" And was that often the case ? "
247673	247734	247171	247172	the man	2092	" Often and often . Well — he ca n't be a saving man , because he has no chance of getting his wages under his own management . He is the publican 's slave — the publican 's tool and instrument . Negro slavery is nothing to it . No tyranny is equal to the tyranny of them publicans . "
247735	247744	247596	247597	the man	2092	" And why is n't the plan altered ? "
247745	247856	247171	247172	the man	2092	" Ah ! why ? What do the owners of the colliers , or the people that the cargo 's consigned to , care about the poor devils that unload ? The publicans takes the unloading on contract , and employs the whippers in such away as to get an enormous profit . Talk of appealing to the owners — what do they care ? There has been meetings got up to change the system — and what 's the consekvence ? Why , them whippers as attended them became marked men , never got no more employment , and drownded themselves in despair , or turned prigs like me . "
247857	247866	247171	247172	the man	2092	" Ah ! that 's better than suicide . "
247867	248010	247596	247597	the man	2092	" Well — I do n't know , now ! But them meetings as I was a - speaking of , got up deputations to the Court of Aldermen , and the matter was referred to the Coal and Corn Committee — and there was , as usual , a great talk , but nothink done . Then an application was made to some Minister — I do n't know which ; and he sent back a letter with a seal as big as a crown - piece , just to say that he 'd received the application , and would give it his earliest attention . Some time passed away , and no more notice was ever taken of it in that quarter ; and so , I s'pose , a Minister 's earliest attention means ten or a dozen years . "
248011	248020	247171	247172	the man	2092	" What a shame to treat people so . "
248021	248196	247171	247172	the man	2092	" It 's only the poor that 's treated so . And now I think I have said enough to show why I turned prig , like a many more whippers from the port of London . There is n't a more degraded , oppressed , and brutalized set of men in the world than the whippers . They are born with examples of drunken fathers afore their eyes ; and drunken fathers makes drunken mothers ; and drunken parents makes sons turn out thieves , and daughters prostitutes;—and that 's the existence of the coal - whippers of Wapping . It ai n't their fault : they have n't edication and self - command to refuse the drink that 's forced upon them , and that they must pay for;—and their sons and daughters should n't be blamed for turning out bad . How can they help it ? And yet one reads in the papers that the upper classes is always a - crying out about the dreadful immorality of the poor ! "
248197	248209	248211	248212	the Cracksman	3270	" The laws — the laws , you see , Tony , "
248217	248221	248223	248225	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Of course , "
248227	248265	248223	248225	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Here we are , in this room , upwards of twenty thieves and prostitutes : I 'll be bound to say that the laws and the state of society made eighteen of them what they are . "
248266	248279	248281	248285	the orator of the evening	7941	" Nobody knows the miseries of a coal - whipper 's life , "
248287	248417	248281	248285	the orator of the evening	7941	" but him that 's been in it his - self . He is always dirty — always lurking about public - houses when not at work — always ready to drink — always in debt — and always dissatisfied with his own way of living , which is n't , however , his fault . There 's no hope for coal - whippers or their families . The sons that do n't turn out thieves must lead the same terrible life of cart - horse labour and constant drinking , with the certainty of dying old men at forty;—and the daughters that do n't turn out prostitutes marry whippers , and draw down upon their heads all the horrors and sorrows of the life I have been describing . "
248418	248428	248223	248225	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Well — I never knowed all this before ! "
248429	248487	248223	248225	the Resurrection Man	3220	" No — and there 's a deal of misery of each kind in London that is n't known to them as dwells in the other kinds of wretchedness : and if these things gets represented in Parliament , the cry is , ' Oh ! the people 's always complaining ; they 're never satisfied . ' "
248488	248515	248517	248522	a young and somewhat prepossessing woman	7942	" Well , you speak of each person knowing his own species of misery , and being ignorant of the nature of the misery next door , "
248536	248568	248580	248585	the woman with the large teeth	7943	" all I can say is , that people see girls like us laughing and joking always in public — but they little know how we weep and moan in private . "
248569	248578	248580	248585	the woman with the large teeth	7943	" Drink gin then , as I do , "
248587	248595	248597	248603	the young female who had previously spoken	7944	" Ah ! you know well enough , "
248605	248631	248597	248603	the young female who had previously spoken	7944	" that we do drink a great deal too much of that ! My father used to sell jiggered gin in George Yard , Whitechapel . "
248632	248641	248643	248647	one of the male guests	7945	" And what the devil is jiggered gin ? "
248649	248692	248694	248696	the young woman	7947	" It 's made from molasses , beer , and vitriol . Lor ' , every one knows what jiggered gin is . Three wine glasses of it will make the strongest man mad drunk . I 'll tell you one thing , "
248698	248770	248694	248696	the young woman	7947	" which you do not seem to know — and that is , that the very , very poor people who are driven almost to despair and suicide by their sorrows , are glad to drink this jiggered gin , which is all that they can afford . For three halfpence they may have enough to send them raving ; and then what do they think or care about their miseries ? "
248771	248777	248779	248781	the coal whipper	7948	" Ah ! very true , "
248783	248791	248779	248781	the coal whipper	7948	" I 've heard of this before . "
248792	248802	248804	248806	the young woman	7947	" Well — my father sold that horrid stuff , "
248808	249058	248804	248806	the young woman	7947	" and though he was constantly getting into trouble for it , he did n't mind ; but the moment he came out of prison , he took to his old trade again . I was his only child ; and my mother died when I was about nine years old . She was always drunk with the jiggered gin ; and one day she fell into the fire and was burnt to death . I had no one then who cared any thing for me , but used to run about in the streets with all the boys in the neighbourhood . My father took in lodgers ; and sixteen or seventeen of us , boys and girls all huddled together , used to sleep in one room not near so big as this . There was fifteen lodging houses of the same kind in George Yard at that time ; and it was supposed that about two hundred and seventy - five persons need to sleep in those houses every night , male and female lodgers all pigging together . Every sheet , blanket , and bolster , in my father 's house was marked with STOP THIEF , in large letters . Well — at eleven years old I went upon the town ; and if I did n't bring home so much money every Saturday night to my father , I used to be well thrashed with a rope 's end on my bare back . "
249059	249071	248779	248781	the coal whipper	7948	" Serve you right too , a pretty girl like you . "
249072	249104	248804	248806	the young woman	7947	" Ah ! you may joke about it — but it was no joke to me ! I would gladly have done anything in an honest way to get my livelihood — "
249105	249114	249116	249121	the Resurrection Man to his companion	7950	" Like me , when I was young , "
249123	249139	249141	249142	the Cracksman	3270	" Exactly . Let 's hear what the gal has got to say for herself , "
249144	249156	249141	249142	the Cracksman	3270	" the lush has made her sentimental;—she'll soon be crying drunk . "
249157	249166	249168	249170	the young woman	7947	" But I was doomed , it seemed , "
249172	249659	249168	249170	the young woman	7947	" to live in this horrible manner . When I was thirteen or fourteen my father died , and I was then left to shift for myself . I moved down into Wapping , and frequented the long - rooms belonging to the public - houses there . I was then pretty well off ; because the sailors that went to these places always had plenty of money and was very generous . But I was one night suspected of hocussing and robbing a sailor , and — though if I was on my death - bed I could swear that I never had any hand in the affair at all — I was so blown upon that I was forced to shift my quarters . So I went to a dress - house in Ada Street , Hackney Road . All the remuneration I received there was board and lodging ; and I was actually a slave to the old woman that kept it . I was forced to walk the streets at night with a little girl following me to see that I did not run away ; and all the money I received I was forced to give up to the old woman . While I was there , several other girls were turned out of doors , and left to die in ditches or on dunghills , because they were no longer serviceable . All this frightened me . And then I was so ill - used , and more than half starved . I was forced to turn out in all weathers — wet or dry — hot or cold — well or ill . Sometimes I have hardly been able to drag myself out of bed with sickness and fatigue — but , no matter , out I must go — the rain perhaps pouring in torrents , or the roads knee - deep in snow — and nothing but a thin cotton gown to wear ! Winter and summer , always flaunting dresses — yellow , green , and red ! Wet or dry , always silk stockings and thin shoes ! Cold or warm , always short skirts and a low body , with strict orders not to fasten the miserable scanty shawl over the bosom ! And then the little girl that followed me about was a spy with wits as sharp as needles . Impossible to deceive her ! At length I grew completely tired of this kind of life ; and so I gave the little spy the slip one fine evening . I was then sixteen , and I came back to this neighbourhood . But one day I met the old woman who kept the dress - house , and she gave me in charge for stealing wearing apparel — the clothes I had on my back when I ran away from her ! "
249660	249679	249681	249683	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Always the police — the police — the police , when the poor and miserable are concerned , "
249688	249697	249699	249702	the coal - heaver	7932	" But did the inspector take the charge ? "
249704	249712	249714	249716	the unfortunate girl	7957	" He not only took the charge , "
249718	249758	249714	249716	the unfortunate girl	7957	" but the magistrate next morning committed me for trial , although I proved to him that the clothes were bought with the wages of my own prostitution ! Well , I was tried at the Central Criminal Court — "
249759	249765	249685	249686	the Cracksman	3270	" And of course acquitted ? "
249766	249773	249714	249716	the unfortunate girl	7957	" No — found Guilty — — "
249774	249782	249714	249716	the unfortunate girl	7957	" What — by an English jury ? "
249783	249802	249685	249686	the Cracksman	3270	" I can show you the newspaper — I have kept the report of the trial ever since . "
249803	249823	249825	249828	the coal - whipper	7958	" Then , by G — d , things are a thousand times worse than I thought they was ! "
249844	249853	249855	249858	the unfortunate young woman	7959	" But the jury recommended me to mercy , "
249860	249929	249855	249858	the unfortunate young woman	7959	" and so the Recorder only sentenced me to twenty - one days ' imprisonment . His lordship also read me a long lecture about the errors of my ways , and advised me to enter upon a new course of life ; but he did not offer to give me a character , nor did he tell me how I was to obtain honest employment without one . "
249930	249939	249941	249948	one of the male inmates of the parlour	7960	" That 's the way with them beaks , "
249950	249995	249941	249948	one of the male inmates of the parlour	7960	" they can talk for an hour ; but supposing you 'd said to the Recorder , ' My Lord , will your wife take me into her service as scullery - girl ? ' he would have stared in astonishment at your imperence . "
249996	250004	250006	250017	the girl who was thus sketching the adventures of her wretched life	7963	" When I got out of prison , "
250019	250149	250006	250017	the girl who was thus sketching the adventures of her wretched life	7963	" I went into Great Titchfield Street . My new abode was a dress - house kept by French people . Every year the husband went over to France , and returned with a famous supply of French girls , and in the mean time his wife decoyed young English women up from the country , under pretence of obtaining situations as nursery - governesses and lady's - maids for them . Many of these poor creatures were the daughters of clergymen and half - pay officers in the marines . The moment a new supply was obtained by these means , circulars was sent round to all the persons that was in the habit of using the house . Different sums , from twenty to a hundred pounds — "
250150	250156	250158	250161	the coal - whipper	7958	" Ah ! I understand , "
250163	250179	250158	250161	the coal - whipper	7958	" But did you ever hear say how many unfortunate gals there was in London ? "
250180	250212	250006	250017	the girl who was thus sketching the adventures of her wretched life	7963	" Eighty thousand . From Titchfield Street I went into the Almonry , Westminster . The houses there are all occupied by fences , prigs , and gals of the town . "
250213	250236	250238	250241	the coal - whipper	7958	" And the parsons of Westminster Abbey , who is the landlords of the houses , does nothink to put 'em down , "
250243	250248	250250	250252	the young woman	7947	" Not a bit , "
250258	250291	250250	250252	the young woman	7947	" We had capital fun in the house where I lived — dog - fighting , badger - baiting , and drinking all day long . The police never visits the Almonry — "
250292	250313	250006	250017	the girl who was thus sketching the adventures of her wretched life	7963	" In course not , 'cos it 's the property of the parsons . They would n't be so rude . "
250355	250364	250366	250369	the coal - whipper	7958	" Well , go on , my dear , "
250377	250397	250399	250401	the young woman	7947	" I never was in a sentimental humour before to - night — not for many , many years , "
250403	250419	250399	250401	the young woman	7947	" and I do n't know what 's making me talk as I am now . "
250420	250432	250434	250438	a coarse - looking fellow	7973	" 'Cos you have n't had enough gin , my dear , "
250959	250965	250966	250966	he	7958	" Well , my dear , "
250985	250994	250966	250966	he	7958	" you have n't done your story yet . "
250995	251014	251015	251015	she	8007	" Oh ! I do not feel in the humour to go on with it to - night , "
251024	251038	251015	251015	she	8007	" Indeed , I recollect — I have an appointment — close by — "
251051	251058	251039	251039	She	8007	" Good - night , all , "
251064	251074	251076	251077	the Cracksman	3270	" Who the deuce is that feller , Tony ? "
251087	251099	251076	251077	the Cracksman	3270	" I ca n't say I like his appearance at all . "
251100	251105	251107	251109	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Oh ! nonsense , "
251111	251130	251107	251109	the Resurrection Man	3220	" he is some quiet chap that does n't like to smoke and talk at the same time . "
251131	251149	251151	251152	the Cracksman	3270	" But do n't it seem as how he 'd throwed a damp on the whole party ? "
251160	251175	251177	251179	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Do you take me for a child that 's frightened at a shadow ? "
251182	251229	251177	251179	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I suppose you 're afraid that this young Holford will play us false . Why — what could he do to us ? Anything he revealed would only implicate himself . He knows nothing about our games up by the Bird - cage Walk there . "
251230	251239	251241	251242	the Cracksman	3270	" I forgot that;—no more he does n't , "
251244	251259	251241	251242	the Cracksman	3270	" There 's nobody can do us any harm , that I know on . "
251260	251267	251269	251271	the Resurrection Man	3220	" One — and one only , "
251282	251301	251274	251274	his	3220	whisper,—"one only , I say , can injure us ; and he will not dare to do it ! "
251302	251310	251312	251313	the Cracksman	954	" Who the devil do you mean ? "
251315	251342	251344	251346	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I mean the only man that ever escaped out of the crib up by the walk after he had received a blow from my stick , "
251348	251358	251360	251361	the Cracksman	3270	" You do n't mean to say , Tony , "
251373	251399	251360	251361	the Cracksman	3270	" that there 's a breathing soul which ever went in the door of that crib an intended wictim , and come out alive agin ! "
251400	251444	251363	251363	his	3270	" Never do you mind now . We shall make all the people stare at us if we go on whispering in this way . Supposing any one did mean to nose upon us have n't we got our barkers in our pocket ? "
251445	251450	251452	251453	the Cracksman	3270	" Ah ! Tony , "
251471	251495	251363	251363	his	3270	idea,—"talking about nosing makes me remember someot that I was told a few days ago up in Rat 's Castle in the Rookery . "
251496	251502	251504	251506	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And what was that ? "
251529	251534	251536	251537	the Cracksman	3270	" What was it ? "
251551	251587	251536	251537	the Cracksman	3270	" why — I heard a magsman say that you nosed upon poor Crankey Jem , and that was the reason he got lagged and you was acquitted three year ago at the Old Bailey . "
251588	251597	251599	251601	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And what did you say to that ? "
251636	251642	251644	251645	the Cracksman	3270	" What did I say ? "
251651	251663	251644	251645	the Cracksman	3270	" why — I knocked the fellow down to be sure . "
251664	251690	251692	251694	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And you did what you ought to do , and what I should have done if any one had told me that of you , "
251858	251864	251866	251867	one reveller	8039	" I say , Ben , "
251871	251894	251866	251867	one reveller	8039	" have you heerd that they 're a goin' to lay out a park up by Bonner 's Road and Hackney Wick ? "
251895	251902	251950	251952	the first speaker	27976	" Yes — the Wictoria Park , "
251907	251943	251950	251952	the first speaker	27976	" On'y fancy giving them poor devils of Spitalfields weavers a park to walk in instead o ' filling their bellies . But I ' spose they 'll make a preshus deep pond in it . "
251944	251948	251950	251952	the first speaker	27976	" What for ? "
251954	251970	251950	251952	the first speaker	27976	" Why — for the poor creturs to drown theirselves in , to be sure . "
252035	252043	252045	252046	the Cracksman	3270	" Well , it 's gone nine , "
252051	252072	252045	252046	the Cracksman	3270	" and this fellow Holford do n't come . It 's my opinion he ai n't a - going to . "
252073	252084	252086	252088	the Resurrection Man	3220	" We 'll give him half an hour 's grace , "
252090	252115	252045	252046	the Cracksman	3270	" The young fool is hard up , and wo n't let the hope of five couters slip through his brain quite so easy . "
252116	252129	252131	252132	the Cracksman	3270	" Half an hour 's grace , as you say , Tony , "
252134	252150	252131	252132	the Cracksman	3270	" and then if he do n't come : we 'll be off — eh ? "
252151	252159	252161	252163	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Oh ! just as you like , "
252165	252178	252161	252163	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You seem quite chicken - hearted to - night , Tom . "
252179	252188	252190	252191	the Cracksman	3270	" I do n't know how it is , "
252193	252218	252220	252220	he	3270	" but I 've got a persentiment — as they calls it — of evil . The sight of that there feller there — — "
252226	252229	252231	252233	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Humbug ! "
252235	252247	252248	252248	He	3270	" you have n't had grog enough — that 's it . "
252649	252655	252641	252643	the other ruffian	2117	" All right , Tom . "
252656	252662	252664	252666	the Resurrection Man	3220	" All right , Tony . "
252719	252722	252724	252726	the Resurrection Man	952	" Damnation ! "
252728	252731	252738	252738	he	3220	" we are sold!"—and
252810	252817	252819	252840	the serjeant who commanded the police , and who was no other than the mysterious stranger of the Dark - House parlour	8102	" Break open the door there ! "
252842	252858	252860	252860	he	8102	" break open that door — and two of you run up stairs this moment ! "
252992	252996	252998	252998	Markham	874	" Good God ! "
253000	253006	252998	252998	Markham	874	" what can that mean ? "
253007	253012	253014	253017	a policeman near him	8118	" There — there ! "
253019	253032	253014	253017	a policeman near him	8118	" it is all over with the serjeant and my poor comrades ! "
253235	253244	253246	253247	the baronet	26709	" Now this is most provoking , Cecilia , "
253249	253274	253246	253247	the baronet	26709	" I never was so much in want of money in my life ; and you refuse to adopt the only means which — — "
253275	253281	253283	253284	the lady	2373	" Yes , Sir Rupert , "
253287	253311	253283	253284	the lady	2373	" I refuse to give you my diamonds to pledge again — and all your arguments shall never persuade me to do so . "
253312	253322	253246	253247	the baronet	26709	" Your heart is too good , Cecilia — — "
253323	253359	253283	253284	the lady	2373	" Oh ! yes — you may try what coaxing will do ; but I can assure you that I am proof against both honied and bitter words . Neither will serve your turn now . "
253360	253377	253379	253380	the baronet	26709	" And yet , somehow or another , you have the command of money , Cecilia , "
253386	253453	253379	253380	the baronet	26709	" You paid all the tradesmen 's bills and servants ' wages about two months ago : you found out — though God only knows how — that Greenwood had the duplicate of your diamonds;—you redeemed the ticket from him , and the jewels themselves from V — — 's ; and from that moment you have never seemed embarrassed for a five - pound note . "
253454	253464	253466	253467	Lady Cecilia	1008	" All that is perfectly true , Sir Rupert , "
253511	253516	253518	253519	the baronet	26709	" Well , then , "
253521	253543	253518	253519	the baronet	26709	" if you can thus obtain supplies for yourself , surely you can do something in the same way for me . "
253544	253553	253555	253556	Lady Cecilia	1008	" I have no ready money at present , "
253558	253572	253555	253556	Lady Cecilia	1008	" and I have determined not to part with my jewels . There ! "
253573	253595	253597	253598	the baronet	26709	" Perhaps you think that I am fool enough to be the dupe of your miserable and flimsy artifices , Cecilia ? "
253601	253616	253597	253598	the baronet	26709	" but I can tell you that I have seen through them all along . "
253617	253620	253622	253623	the lady	2373	" You ! "
253643	253651	253653	253654	the baronet	26709	" Yes — I , Lady Cecilia , "
253656	253670	253653	253654	the baronet	26709	" I am not quite such a fool as you take me for . "
253671	253683	253685	253687	the guilty wife	8134	" My God , Sir Rupert ! what — how — who——- "
253705	253717	253719	253720	the baronet	26709	" There ! you see that all my suspicions are confirmed , "
253722	253728	253719	253720	the baronet	26709	" your confusion proves it . "
253729	253750	253653	253654	the baronet	26709	" You can not say that — that — I have ever given you any cause , Sir Rupert — — "
253751	253781	253653	253654	the baronet	26709	" What ? to doubt your word ? Oh ! no — I ca n't say that you are in the habit of telling falsehoods generally ; but — — "
253782	253786	253719	253720	the baronet	26709	" Sir Rupert ! "
253787	253832	253653	253654	the baronet	26709	" Nay — I will speak out ! The fact is , you pretend to have quarrelled with Lady Tremordyn ; and it is all nonsense . Your mother supplies you with as much money as you require — and that is the secret ! "
253833	253842	253844	253845	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Oh ! Sir Rupert — Sir Rupert ! "
253868	253987	253653	253654	the baronet	26709	" You can not deny what I affirm , Cecilia . And now that I bethink me , it is most probable that Greenwood himself told Lord Tremordyn ( with whom he was intimate at that time , although they have since quarrelled , God only knows what about ) of my having placed the duplicate of the diamonds in his hands , and so your father arranged that matter with Greenwood . It is a gross system of duplicity , Cecilia — a gross system ; a pretended quarrel merely to prevent me from visiting at the house of my father - in - law . But , by God ! I will stand it no longer ! "
253988	253996	253998	253999	Lady Cecilia	1008	" What will you do , then ? "
254003	254026	253998	253999	Lady Cecilia	1008	" What will I do ? I will go straight off to Lord and Lady Tremordyn , and tell them my mind . "
254027	254040	253653	253654	the baronet	26709	" And Lord and Lady Tremordyn will tell you theirs in return . "
254041	254053	253653	253654	the baronet	26709	" And what can they say , madam , against me ? "
254054	254069	253998	253999	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Nay — Sir Rupert , rather ask what they can say for you . "
254070	254089	254091	254092	the baronet.—"Well	32620	" Oh ! you wish to irritate me , madam — you are anxious to quarrel with me , "
254092	254143	253998	253999	Lady Cecilia	1008	baronet.—"Well — be it so ! As for your father and mother , I will tell them that they do not act honourably , nor even prudently , in allowing their son - in - law to live by his wits and be compelled to raise money where he can . "
254144	254175	253998	253999	Lady Cecilia	1008	" And they will tell you in reply , that you did not act honourably nor prudently to squander the large sum they gave you when you married their daughter . "
254176	254182	254184	254185	the baronet	26709	" The devil they will ! "
254187	254212	254184	254185	the baronet	26709	" Then , in that case , I shall remind them of the consideration for which the large sum you allude to was given . "
254213	254218	254220	254221	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Monster — coward ! "
254223	254246	254220	254221	Lady Cecilia	1008	" do you dare to throw in my teeth the weakness of which I was guilty through excess of love for you ? "
254247	254300	253998	253999	Lady Cecilia	1008	" I am sure you need not be so fastidious , Cecilia . To talk of love now , between a man of the world like me and a woman of the world like you , is an absurdity;—and as for the little weakness of which you speak , I repaired it . "
254301	254304	254306	254307	the lady	2373	" Yes , "
254311	254360	254306	254307	the lady	2373	" When you saw me kneeling in despair at your feet — and when my mother implored you to save her daughter 's honour , you turned a deaf ear to our entreaties — you scorned our prayers : but when my father offered a golden argument — — "
254361	254371	253998	253999	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Lady Cecilia — silence , I command you ! "
254372	254383	254385	254386	the lady	2373	" When he offered a golden argument , I say , "
254392	254517	254385	254386	the lady	2373	" — when he produced his cheque - book , Sir Rupert Harborough pretended to yield to my entreaties ; and as he raised me from the ground — condescendingly raised me — me , the daughter of a peer — with one hand,—with the other he clutched the bribe ! Ah ! Sir Rupert — you spoilt a good heart — you trampled a confiding disposition in the dust — when you would not allow yourself to be purchased by my love , but still consented to sell yourself to me for my father 's gold ! Oh ! it was the vile instance of a man prostituting himself for gain , as poor weak woman has so often been doomed to do ! "
254518	254541	254543	254545	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" Lady Cecilia — I am astonished — I am amazed at the terms in which you allow yourself to address me ! "
254560	254564	254385	254386	the lady	2373	" And now , "
254568	254729	254730	254730	she	8140	lady,—"now you solicit me to ruin myself for you — to part with my very ornaments to supply your extravagances,—you , who had no pity upon my tears , no feeling for my anguish , no respect for my honour ! No , Sir Rupert Harborough : I have assisted you once — assisted you twice — assisted you thrice — assisted you a hundred times already ; and what return have you made me ? When you are penniless , you remain at home : when you are in the possession of funds , you remain absent for weeks and weeks together . You may love me no longer , it is true;—and , with regard to myself , I confess that your conduct has long — long ago destroyed all the romance of affection in my bosom . Still a woman can not endure neglect — at least I thought so a few months ago;—but now — now , "
254741	254754	254730	254730	she	8140	" I am indifferent alike as to your attention or your neglect ! "
254755	254768	254770	254771	Sir Rupert	887	" At least , Lady Cecilia , you are candid and explicit , "
254777	254787	254770	254771	Sir Rupert	887	" But perhaps you have something more to observe . "
254788	254793	254795	254796	the lady	2373	" No — nothing , "
254822	254825	254770	254771	Sir Rupert	887	" scene , "
254832	254842	254844	254845	the baronet	26709	" Well , what news with the old man ? "
254848	254860	254862	254862	Chichester	886	" My father will not advance me another shilling until June , "
254870	254890	254862	254862	Chichester	886	" and as for your bill — he wo n't look at it . Any thing good with you ? "
254891	254905	254907	254908	the baronet	26709	" Nothing . Lady Cecilia positively refuses to part with the jewels again , "
254916	254923	254907	254908	the baronet	26709	" And ca n't you — — "
254924	254930	254862	254862	Chichester	886	" Ca n't I what ? "
254931	254944	254946	254946	Chichester	886	" Ca n't you help yourself to them in spite of her ? "
254948	254951	254953	254953	Harborough	887	" Impossible ! "
254955	254982	254953	254953	Harborough	887	" She keeps them under lock and key in her own room ; and the door of that room she always locks when she goes out . "
254983	254998	255000	255000	Chichester	886	" How provoking ! If we only had some ready money at this moment , "
255002	255010	255000	255000	Chichester	886	" we might make a little fortune . "
255011	255036	254953	254953	Harborough	887	" Yes — town is full — and such opportunities as we might have ! By Jove , we must raise the wine somewhere . "
255037	255046	254953	254953	Harborough	887	" You do not think that Greenwood — — "
255047	255057	255059	255060	the baronet	26709	" Oh ! no — not for a moment ! "
255089	255102	255151	255151	he	886	" no — I can not apply to Greenwood for a shilling . "
255103	255130	255132	255133	Mr. Chichester	886	" And after all the pains I have taken in perfecting you in the new dodges with the cards and dice , ready for this season , "
255154	255172	255151	255151	he	886	" Here are the implements we want , too : every thing prepared — except the money . "
255173	255176	255178	255179	the baronet	26709	" Ah ! "
255181	255193	255178	255179	the baronet	26709	" you have got the things , then , at last ? "
255194	255197	255199	255199	Chichester	886	" Yes , "
255212	255388	255199	255199	Chichester	886	" Here are the scratched dice , you see . These must be used upon a bare table , because it is necessary to judge by the sound of the dice in the box whether they are on the scratched side or not . You understand that a hole has been drilled in the centre pip of the five in this die , and in the ace of the other ; a piece of ebony is then inserted , with a very small portion projecting . These dice can not , therefore , fall perfectly flat , when the five side of the one and the ace of the other are underneath on the table ; and it is very easy for the thrower just to move the box the least thing before he lifts it , to that the sound may tell him whether the scratched side is down or not . But you are to recollect that a man must be very drunk when you can use them with any degree of safety . "
255389	255397	255399	255400	Sir Rupert	887	" I should think so , indeed , "
255402	255424	255426	255426	Chichester	886	" I can assure you that no implements of our craft are , on certain occasions , more destructive than these , "
255428	255442	255426	255426	Chichester	886	" And what is the use of these slight scratches upon the dice ? "
255443	255455	255457	255457	Chichester	886	" To assist the eye in manipulating them . But here , "
255474	255675	255426	255426	Chichester	886	admiration,—"here is a famous antidote to fair dice . Do n't you see that when fair dice are used , you must introduce an unfair box . Many a greenhorn may have heard of loaded dice , and so on ; but very few know that there is such a thing as the Doctor Dice - box . Honour to the man , say I , who invented it . If you judge by the outside of this box , it is a very fair - looking one ; but just put your finger into it , and you will feel that no less than three - quarters of the inside are filled up , so that there is now only just space enough left in the middle for the dice to fit in . Towards the top the sides grow larger and smoother . The dice , you see , rattle by rising up and down , when shaken briskly , but do not change their position . All that you have to do is to put them in , in the first instance , with a view to the way in which you want them to come up . "
255676	255704	255706	255707	the baronet	26709	" So that if you want to throw a six and a five , put the dice into the box with the ace and the two uppermost , "
255709	255712	255714	255714	Chichester	886	" Precisely , "
255716	255746	255714	255714	Chichester	886	" A fair box , you know as well as I do , has one or more rims inside , against which the dice must turn in coming out . "
255747	255752	255754	255755	the baronet	26709	" By the bye , "
255757	255796	255754	255755	the baronet	26709	" what is the Gradus , Chichester ? you promised to show me a great many times , and have forgotten it ; but now that we are upon the subject , you may as well enlighten me . "
255797	255804	255820	255820	he	8149	" Certainly , my dear fellow , "
255823	255910	255820	255820	he	8149	" nothing is more easy than the Gradus , or Step . It is often much safer than Bridging , too . Bridging is known by every snob about town who pretends to set up for a Greek . All that you have to do for the Gradus is to let any particular card you fancy project a little in this way , so as to make sure that your opponent will turn it up , at whist or ecarté , as the case may be . "
255911	255933	255714	255714	Chichester	886	" Excellent ! I like the plan better than any other you ever yet showed me for effecting the same object . "
255934	255942	255944	255944	Chichester	886	" Palming may sometimes be done successfully , "
255946	256065	255944	255944	Chichester	886	" but you must have the small French cards to do it . There — all that there is to do is to secrete a particular card under the palm and partially up the sleeve till it is required . When your opponent is well primed , you can easily introduce a fifth king , or fifth ace , in this way . There is a great deal of art , too , in shuffling , or Weaving . At ecarté or whist , always watch which tricks taken up have the best cards ; then , when you take up all the cards to shuffle them again , weave in the good tricks to suit your purposes . "
256066	256076	256078	256079	the baronet	26709	" I heard a gentleman say the other night , "
256081	256097	256078	256079	the baronet	26709	" that he had been most gloriously fleeced by a fellow who used pricked cards . "
256098	256106	256108	256108	Chichester	886	" Ah ! they are capital weapons , "
256110	256215	256108	256108	Chichester	886	" Just lay the high cards flat on their backs , and then prick them with a very fine needle , so as to raise the slightest possible pimple in the world upon the backs down in one of the corners ; but mind , the cards are not to be punctured quite through . The fellow who told me how to do this dodge , used some chemical preparation to the ball of his thumb , which made that part almost raw , and consequently so very sensitive that he could feel the smallest possible pimple on the card with the greatest ease . "
256216	256224	256226	256227	Sir Rupert	887	" And what have you got there ? "
256244	256249	256251	256252	the Mentor	8151	" These are Reflectors , "
256254	256425	256251	256252	the Mentor	8151	" They are French cards , you perceive , and are only manufactured in France . They cost two guineas a pack ; but then — only think of their utility ! Look at the backs of these cards : instead of being plain , they are figured . Now this to a common observer is nothing , most of the French cards being , you know , variegated with flowers or other designs at the back . But to the initiated , the lines upon these cards are every thing . Mark how they run . All the high cards have semicircles in the corners , while all the low cards have the ends of the lines meeting in the corners . Then , by a more minute study still of these cards , it is easy to know kings , queens , knaves , and aces , by the manner in which the lines run upon the back . I hope these weapons are dangerous enough for you . "
256426	256438	256440	256441	the baronet	26709	" They are decidedly the most efficient I have yet seen , "
256443	256487	256440	256441	the baronet	26709	" I think we now know all the mysteries of the gaming world ; and , considering how many flats there are in London and the watering places , it would be astonishing indeed if we could not pick up a handsome living . "
256488	256494	256496	256497	Mr. Chichester	886	" Of course it would , "
256499	256660	256496	256497	Mr. Chichester	886	" The mania for play is most extraordinary . The moment a young man enters upon life , he fancies that it is very fine to frequent gambling - houses or lose his loose gold at private play : indeed he imagines that he can not be a man of the world without it . There is our advantage . That anxiety to be looked upon as a fine dashing fellow is the real cause of the immense increase of gaming propensities . Young men do not begin to play in the first instance because they like it : they commence , simply to gratify their vanity ; and then they imbibe the taste and acquire the habit . What they began through pride , they continue through love . There , again , I say , is our pull:—there always will be flats ready to throw themselves head and shoulders into the nets that sharps spread out for them . "
256661	256670	256672	256673	the baronet	26709	" All that is very true , Chichester , "
256675	256759	256760	256760	Chichester	886	" But we do n't want a homily on the vice of gambling this afternoon : what we require is the needful to enable us to put our plans into execution . The old tricks that you taught me more than three years ago in that very respectable lodging which you occupied in Bartholomew Close , are well - nigh worn out : we have now studied fresh ones;—but we are totally deficient in the steam to set our new engines in motion . "
256780	256788	256790	256791	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Well — it is all right ! "
256815	256821	256824	256825	the baronet	26709	" What is all right ? "
256833	256849	256851	256851	Greenwood	903	" Why — have you not heard that the election for Rottenborough took place yesterday ? "
256853	256864	256866	256867	the baronet	26709	" Oh ! to be sure — I forgot that ! "
256869	256881	256866	256867	the baronet	26709	" But you surely never have beaten Lord Tremordyn 's candidate ? "
256882	256892	256894	256894	Greenwood	903	" Yes — I was returned triumphantly—814 against 102 , "
256896	256906	256908	256908	Chichester	886	" I wish you joy , my dear fellow , "
256910	256930	256908	256908	Chichester	886	" I suppose you astonished the natives of Rottenborough ? but how the devil did you manage this victory ? "
256931	256944	256946	256946	Greenwood	903	" I will give you a brief sketch of the whole proceeding , "
256963	257023	256946	256946	Greenwood	903	" The fact is , I learnt in the latter part of December that the representative of Rottenborough intended to accept the Chiltern Hundreds when the Houses met in February . You know that I was at that time very intimate with Lord Tremordyn , your worthy and much revered father - in - law , Sir Rupert — — "
257024	257031	257033	257034	the baronet	26709	" Ah ! worthy , indeed ! "
257037	257045	257047	257047	Greenwood	903	" I accordingly spoke to Lord Tremordyn , "
257049	257244	257047	257047	Greenwood	903	" and , after a little delicate manœuvring , received his promise to support me,—in fact , to get me in for Rottenborough . It had been arranged that Count Alteroni and his family were to pass the month of January and a portion of February with Lord and Lady Tremordyn ; but in the mean time , the count learned something about me , as I before told you , which he did not like ; and he rejected me as a suitor for his daughter 's hand . That did not grieve me much . My only motives for making up to the signora at all were , because I really liked the girl , and because she is a nobleman 's daughter . But the count did not stop there . He sent an apology to Lord and Lady Tremordyn , and declined the invitation . Off goes his lordship to Richmond , and calls upon the count . The count spoke so ill of me , it appears , that his lordship determined to cut me . There seemed at first an insurmountable obstacle to my hopes relative to Rottenborough . "
257245	257257	257259	257259	Chichester	886	" Yes — but you are never dismayed at any thing , "
257261	257275	257259	257259	Chichester	886	" Never . There is no such word as impossible in my vocabulary , "
257279	257706	257259	257259	Chichester	886	" and as for improbable — that is a word which can only intimidate cowards . I made up my mind to exert all my energies to obtain the gratification of my wishes . I had set my mind upon becoming an M.P. I had dreamt of it — thought upon it for hours together — and had even based certain calculations and schemes upon the event . I was not to be disappointed . I immediately went down to Rottenborough , and put up at the principal inn . I looked about me for a day or two , and at length saw something that suited me — an old mansion in such a ruined and dilapidated state , that it would require three or four thousand pounds to restore it to a habitable and comfortable condition . It belonged to the banker of the place . I bought it without haggling , and thus made a friend of him . I then set all the masons , carpenters , decorators , and upholsterers in the place to work , paid a considerable sum into the banker 's hands , and appointed the head solicitor in the town to be my agent . I moreover gave him certain secret instructions relative to my ultimate views , and returned to London . Every Saturday I went down to Rottenborough — it is only twenty - four miles from London , you know — and paid all the bills without demanding discount . I also sent fifty pounds to the clergyman of the parish to lay out in purchasing blankets for the poor ; and paid the coal merchant for fifty tons of coals also for charitable distribution . I always remained at Rottenborough until Monday mornings , and went to church three times on the Sundays . No one spoke the responses louder than I did — no one dwelt with such holy delight upon the clergyman 's sermons as myself . I moreover won the hearts of the churchwardens , by placing a ten - pound note in the plate , after a charity sermon ; and I secured the overseer by visiting the workhouse with him , tasting the soup , and pronouncing the dietary - scale to amount to absolute luxuries . In this manner , I was soon talked about . ' Who is this Mr. Greenwood ? ' was the universal question . ' A wealthy capitalist of London , ' answered the lawyer . Thus , every thing progressed well . "
257707	257713	257715	257716	the baronet	26709	" So I should imagine , "
257718	258078	257715	257716	the baronet	26709	" Well — parliament met — the representative of Rottenborough resigned his seat ; and the next morning by eight o'clock , my lawyer - agent had secured every inn , tavern , and public - house in Rottenborough in my name . Placards were posted all over the town , announcing my intention to come forward in the liberal interest , Lord Tremordyn having always supported the opposite side . Down goes Lord Tremordyn with his candidate , and is quite astonished to see all the walls and houses covered with posters , on which the name of Greenwood appeared in monster - type . But if he were surprised at first , how much more was he compelled to marvel , and how deeply was he annoyed , when not an inn — not a tavern — not even a public - house , would receive him , or his horses . His lordship drove to the rector 's . The parson ' was excessively glad to see his lordship , and hoped his lordship would make his ( the rector 's ) house his home ; but he ( the rector ) could not think of entertaining the Conservative candidate also , as he had promised his vote to a gentleman who intended to settle in the place , and who had already done a vast amount of good there . ' Lord Tremordyn was astounded . He went to the banker 's . Precisely the same answer . The brewer , the coal - merchant , the Chairman of the Board of Poor Law Guardians ( who had heard that I admired the soup and considered gruel at nineteen out of twenty - one meals every week , to be actually encouraging in the poor a taste for luxuries ) all spoke well of me . Lord Tremordyn grew livid with rage ; and he was compelled to take up his quarters , with the new candidate , at the house of the undertaker , whose services I had neglected to secure , not having known upon what possible pretence to order a few coffins . "
258079	258082	258084	258085	Sir Rupert	887	" Capital ! "
258087	258108	258084	258085	Sir Rupert	887	" I am glad the old lord was taken in at last — he who fancied himself omnipotent at Rottenborough . "
258109	258279	257715	257716	the baronet	26709	" Every engine of Tory tactics was now put into execution by Lord Tremordyn , his candidate , and his agents . All his tenants who had not paid up their arrears of rent , were menaced with executions and ejectments if they did not vote for the Conservative . My lawyer knew how to counteract this influence . He found out all the tenants who were in arrears , and proffered them loans payable at very distant dates . This accommodation was gladly accepted ; and they were of course given to understand that the assistance emanated from me . ' At the same time , ' said my lawyer , ' you must not think that this is a mere electioneering manœuvre to secure your support . No — remain free and independent electors . Mr. Greenwood 's wishes and objects were merely to defeat tyranny and annihilate intimidation . ' In this way we completely weaned his own tenants away from Lord Tremordyn and his cause . "
258280	258293	258295	258295	Chichester	886	" All this must have cost you a great deal of money , "
258297	258338	258295	258295	Chichester	886	" Not near so much as you would fancy . But , whatever it was , it was well spent . The position of an M.P. to me is worth thousands and thousands:—I know how to avail myself of it . "
258339	258349	258351	258353	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" I wish I had your head , Greenwood , "
258359	258601	258616	258616	Chichester	886	" My dear baronet , if you had my head and lacked my perseverance , my industry , and my power of self - command , you would be but little benefited . Let me , however , continue my narrative of the electioneering proceedings . There was now nothing but placarding and counter - placarding . My canvassers were most eloquent in my cause . ' Do not look , ' said they , ' to whether a man be Whig or Tory — Radical or Conservative : ascertain whether he will benefit the town — whether he will be charitable to the poor , will support the tradesmen , and will dwell during the recess amongst the inhabitants of Rottenborough . What good have the candidates of the Tremordyn interest ever done for ye , O Rottenboroughers ? Has the present candidate an account at the banker 's ? has he given away blankets and coals wholesale ? has he come regularly on Sunday to attend divine service in our parish church three times ? has he employed the greater portion of the tradesmen of the town ? No — he appears amongst you as a stranger — making fine promises , but having given an earnest of nothing . Look at Greenwood — a man of enormous wealth — known probity — vast experience — high character — splendid qualifications — unlimited charity — and undoubted piety . ' "
258602	258614	258616	258616	Chichester	886	" I suppose you wrote out all that for your canvassers ? "
258618	258735	258616	258616	Chichester	886	" No : my lawyer copied a character for me out of an old romance ; and it seemed to be admirably appreciated . At length the eventful day — yesterday — came . You may depend upon it , I was up early . My band and colours commenced parading about the town at seven o'clock ; and my lawyer had very prudently hired the clown and pantaloon of Richardson 's Theatre to attend the band , and amuse the people with their antics during the intervals between the different airs . This told wonderfully well , and , as I afterwards learnt , won thirty - three votes away from Lord Tremordyn 's candidate . "
258736	258754	258756	258757	the baronet	26709	" A fact which speaks volumes in favour of the intellectual qualifications of the people of Rottenborough , "
258759	258767	258769	258769	Greenwood	903	" But the beauty of it was , "
258771	258817	258769	258769	Greenwood	903	" that my lawyer had the clown in the Guildhall , when my opponent addressed the electors ; and the fellow imitated the gesticulations and the facial contortions of Lord Tremordyn 's candidate so well , that the speech was drowned in roars of laughter . "
258818	258833	258835	258835	Chichester	886	" And I suppose that your speech was listened to with the greatest attention ? "
258837	258842	258835	258835	Chichester	886	" The very greatest , "
258846	259479	258835	258835	Chichester	886	" and I can assure you that I pitched them the gammon in the very finest possible style . ' Gentlemen , ' I said , ' it is well known that not a single town in this empire contains a more enlightened , intellectual , and independent population than Rottenborough . The inhabitants of Rottenborough are the envy of surrounding cities , and the admiration of the universe . History has ever been busy with the name of Rottenborough ; and never has a gallant Rottenborougher disgraced his name , his country , or his cause . This is the chosen home of freedom : if you seek for independence , you will find it in the peaceful groves and delicious retreats of Rottenborough . Famous also is this town for the loveliness and virtue of its women ; and beauteous and faithful wives make their husbands and sons good and great . Oh ! supremely blessed is the town of Rottenborough , situate in its happy valley , and through whose streets sweep balmy gales , laden with perfume and delicious odour . '—At this moment , the voice of some purblind Tory exclaimed , ' What do you say to the putrid black ditch at the back of the church ? ' Of course one of my own supporters smashed this ruffian 's hat over his eyes ; and I then proceeded thus : ' Gentlemen , free and independent electors of Rottenborough ! I offer myself as your representative ! I throw myself into your arms ! I undertake your cause ! Tory influence has long blunted your energies : Tory machinations have for years dimmed the bright and brilliant intellects of the Rottenboroughers . Do you ask me what are my principles ? I will tell you . I am a liberal in every sense of the word . I am anxious that every free and independent elector of Rottenborough shall have his beef and beer for nothing — which shall be the case to - morrow , if I am returned to - day . I am desirous that the industrious classes should be improved in condition — that they should have more food and less treadmill , and be supplied with flannel to expel the bleak and nipping cold of winter . This want it shall be my duty to supply . But that is not all : I hope to see the day arrive when every pauper in the workhouse at Rottenborough shall thank God for his happy condition , and receive an extra half ounce of bacon for the dinner of the Sabbath ! These are my fond aspirations — these are my aims ! If I seem to promise much — I am ready to perform it all . Trust me — try me — place me in a condition to be useful to you . I have now expounded to you all my views — I have laid bare my secret soul to your eyes ; and heaven can attest the sincerity of my intentions . Under these circumstances I confidently claim your suffrage;—but if it should happen that I am disappointed — if I am forced to shut up the mansion which I have purchased in this neighbourhood , suspend all the works , and fly for ever from the peaceful retreats and delicious haunts of Rottenborough , I shall at least——. ' Here it was arranged between my lawyer and me that my voice was to falter and that I should seem as if I was about to faint . I accordingly wound up the farce with a little bit of melodrama : and from that instant the cause of my opponent was desperate beyond all chances of redemption . "
259480	259490	259492	259492	Chichester	886	" You deserved success , after that brilliant speech ; "
259500	259539	259492	259492	Chichester	886	" The polling was continued briskly until four o'clock , when the mayor closed the books and announced that George Greenwood , Esquire , Gentleman , was duly returned to serve in Parliament as the representative of Rottenborough . "
259540	259558	259560	259560	Chichester	886	" When shall you ' take your oaths and your seat , ' as the papers say ? "
259562	259566	259568	259568	Greenwood	903	" This evening , "
259570	259582	259568	259568	Greenwood	903	" And of course you will range yourself amongst the liberals ? "
259583	259598	259600	259604	the new Member of Parliament	8161	" How can you fancy that I shall be guilty of such egregious folly ? "
259606	259630	259600	259604	the new Member of Parliament	8161	" The reign of the Liberals is drawing to a close : a Tory administration within a year or eighteen months is inevitable . "
259631	259646	259568	259568	Greenwood	903	" But you stood forward as a Liberal , and were returned as such . "
259647	259687	259568	259568	Greenwood	903	" Very true — very true , my dear fellow . But do you imagine that I became a Member of Parliament to meet the interests and wishes of a pack of strangers , or to suit my own ? "
259688	259696	259600	259604	the new Member of Parliament	8161	" And at the next election — — "
259697	259745	259568	259568	Greenwood	903	" I shall be returned again . Mark my word for that . A politician is not worth a fig who has not a dozen excuses ready for the most flagrant tergiversation ; and money — money will purchase all the free and independent electors of Rottenborough . "
259766	259768	259770	259770	Greenwood	903	" her aversion"—but
259780	259799	259777	259778	The baronet	26709	" that he should leave Mr. Greenwood to amuse Lady Cecilia with an account of his electioneering exploits ; "
259807	259809	259810	259811	Mr. Chichester	886	" shadow "
259813	259820	259822	259823	Lady Cecilia	1008	" You have succeeded , George ? "
259832	259842	259844	259844	Greenwood	903	" To my heart 's content , dearest Cecilia , "
259872	259880	259882	259883	Lady Cecilia	1008	" I am delighted with this result , "
259885	259901	259882	259883	Lady Cecilia	1008	" although my own father has sustained a defeat in the person of his candidate . "
259902	259913	259915	259919	the new Member of Parliament	8161	" All fair in the political world , dear Cecilia , "
259921	259954	259915	259919	the new Member of Parliament	8161	" But you have not yet appeared to understand that I came hither the moment I returned from Rottenborough,—to bear to you , first and foremost , the news of my success . "
259955	259979	259981	259982	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Ah ! dearest George , how can I ever sufficiently testify my gratitude to thee for all thy proofs of ardent love ? "
259991	260003	260005	260005	Greenwood	903	" Yes — I love you — I love you well , "
260132	260140	260142	260142	Chichester	886	" I beg you a thousand pardons , "
260151	260161	260142	260142	Chichester	886	" but I had left this parcel behind me ; "
260180	260184	260177	260177	he	886	" Merciful heavens ! "
260189	260204	260177	260177	he	886	" we are discovered — we are betrayed ! That wretch will ruin us ! "
260205	260218	260220	260220	Greenwood	903	" Do not fear — do not alarm yourself , sweetest lady , "
260222	260240	260241	260241	He	903	" I will undertake to stop that man 's mouth ! One moment — and I return . "
260257	260265	260267	260267	Greenwood	903	" Chichester , one word with you , "
260269	260281	260267	260267	Greenwood	903	" A dozen , if you like , my dear fellow . "
260282	260297	260241	260241	He	903	" You came into the drawing - room a minute ago — unexpectedly — — "
260298	260306	260267	260267	Greenwood	903	" And I apologised for my rudeness . "
260307	260336	260267	260267	Greenwood	903	" Yes — but you are not the less possessed of a secret which involves the honour of a lady — the happiness of an entire family — — "
260337	260354	260356	260356	Chichester	886	" Greenwood , I am a man of the world : you can rely upon me , "
260358	260385	260356	260356	Chichester	886	" Fear nothing on that score . You have now asked your favour , and obtained it of me : let me request one of you . "
260386	260395	260267	260267	Greenwood	903	" Command me in any way you choose . "
260396	260411	260356	260356	Chichester	886	" I am at this moment embarrassed for a hundred pounds or so — — "
260412	260421	260426	260426	he	903	" Say no more : they are yours , "
260442	260446	260448	260449	that individual	28209	" Thank you , "
260468	260477	260479	260480	Sir Rupert	887	" Well — have you found your implements ? "
260490	260501	260503	260503	Chichester	886	" Yes — and a hundred pounds into the bargain , "
260507	260514	260503	260503	Chichester	886	" A hundred pounds ! Impossible ! "
260515	260530	260479	260480	Sir Rupert	887	" There is the bank - note . It is just what we required . "
260531	260536	260503	260503	Chichester	886	" But how — — "
260537	260566	260568	260568	Chichester	886	" Greenwood was coming down stairs , and I mustered up courage to ask him for a loan . He complied without a moment 's hesitation . Indeed , "
260574	260598	260568	260568	Chichester	886	" I almost think that I shall be enabled , in case of emergency , to obtain another supply from the same quarter . "
260599	260607	260609	260609	Harborough	887	" This is fortunate — most fortunate ! "
260611	260636	260609	260609	Harborough	887	" Let us go and dine at Long 's or Stephen 's this evening , and see if we can pick up a flat . "
260669	260676	260677	260677	he	903	" Any one called , Lafleur ? "
260691	260715	260677	260677	he	903	" Two gentlemen ; sir . Their cards are upon your desk . They both declared that they would call again to day . "
260774	260779	260781	260782	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Ah ! ha ! "
260787	260809	260781	260782	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I understand what this means ! Already at work , eh ? No time to be lost , I see . "
260818	260887	260815	260815	he	903	" You see , my good fellow , that when a man like me — a man of — of — consideration , in a word — becomes entrusted with the interests of a free , enlightened , and independent constituency , like that of Rottenborough , the Ministerial party and the Opposition each endeavour to secure me to their cause — you understand , Lafleur — eh ? "
260888	260893	260815	260815	he	903	" Perfectly , sir , "
260904	260911	260913	260914	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Well , then , Lafleur , "
260916	260995	260913	260914	Mr. Greenwood	903	" you must know farther that each party has its whipper - in . The whippers - in keep lists of those who belong respectively to their own parties , and collect them together when their support is absolutely necessary on a division of the House . In fact , the whippers - in are the huntsmen of the pack : and the members all collect at the sound of their bugles . Do you comprehend , Lafleur ? "
260996	261006	260815	260815	he	903	" Yes , sir — thank you , sir . "
261007	261046	260913	260914	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I must therefore see both these gentlemen — but separately , mind . If they should happen to call at the same time , show one into the drawing - room while I receive the other here . "
261047	261052	260913	260914	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Yes , sir . "
261053	261059	261061	261062	Mr. Greenwood	903	" And now , Lafleur , "
261064	261092	261093	261093	Lafleur	1064	" while we are upon the subject , I may as well give you a few instructions relative to that deportment which my altered position renders necessary . "
261096	261117	261119	261120	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Placed in a situation of high responsibility and trust , by the confidence of an intelligent and enlightened constituency , "
261122	261210	261119	261120	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I am bound to maintain a position which may inspire respect and confidence . In the first place , as it can not be supposed that I shall receive many epistolary communications until my opinions upon particular measures and questions become known through my parliamentary conduct,—and as , at the same time , it would be disgraceful for the neighbourhood to imagine that my correspondence is limited , you must take care that the two - penny postman never passes my door without leaving a letter . "
261211	261246	261061	261062	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Yes , sir . I will have a letter , addressed to you , posted every two hours , sir , so that you can not fail to receive one by each delivery . "
261247	261259	261261	261262	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Good , Lafleur ; and you can tell the postman , "
261264	261279	261261	261262	Mr. Greenwood	903	" to knock louder than he has been in the habit of doing — — "
261280	261297	261061	261062	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Yes , sir ; because it is difficult to hear from the servants ' offices . "
261298	261366	261061	261062	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Precisely , Lafleur . And you can tell our newsman to bring me all the second editions of the newspapers whenever there are any ; and mind you always keep the news - boy waiting a long time at the door . Tell him , moreover , to bawl out ' second edition ' of whatever paper it may be , as loud as he can . "
261367	261379	261381	261381	Lafleur	1064	" I will take care he shall do so , sir , "
261383	261392	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" And once a week , or so , "
261400	261466	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" let an express - courier gallop at full speed up to the house , and ring and knock furiously until the door is opened . But , mind that he comes from at least three or four miles distant , so that his horse may be covered with foam , and himself with mud or dust , according to the state of the weather . "
261467	261473	261061	261062	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I understand , sir . "
261474	261544	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" Moreover , Lafleur , at least three or four times a week , go to Leadenhall Market and purchase the game and poultry which we may require for the house , and send it home by the London Parcels Delivery Company , so that the neighbours may say , ' More presents for Mr. Greenwood . Dear me ! how popular he must be with his constituents ! ' "
261545	261552	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" I fully comprehend , sir . "
261553	261569	261571	261575	the new Member of Parliament	8161	" You can send fish home , too,—and haunches of venison in the same manner , "
261577	261611	261571	261575	the new Member of Parliament	8161	" but mind that the feathers of the pheasants , the tails of the fish , and the feet of the haunches always hang out of the baskets in which they are packed . "
261612	261619	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" Oh ! certainly , sir . "
261620	261668	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" If you could possibly get a charity - school to wait upon me some morning , to solicit me to become a patron , or any thing of that sort , it would do good , and I should make a handsome donation to the funds . "
261669	261700	261571	261575	the new Member of Parliament	8161	" That can be managed , sir . I can safely promise that seventy boys and ninety girls shall wait upon you in procession any day you choose to appoint . "
261701	261729	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" Well and good , Lafleur . And mind that they are kept standing for three quarters of an hour in the street before they are admitted . "
261730	261739	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" As a matter of course , sir . "
261740	261751	261753	261754	Mr. Greenwood	903	" And now I will just mention a few things , "
261756	261779	261753	261754	Mr. Greenwood	903	" that you most manage with very great nicety . Indeed , I know I can rely upon you in every thing . "
261783	261831	261780	261780	Lafleur	1064	" You must turn away all Italian organ - players . The moment one shows himself under our windows , let one of the footmen rush out and order him off . It is not proper to encourage such vagabonds : the aristocracy do n't like them . "
261832	261838	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" Certainly not , sir . "
261839	261946	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" Organ - playing is a thing I am determined to put an end to . There is also the hoop nuisance . Give any boy into charge , whatever may be his age , who is caught trundling a hoop in Spring Gardens . That is another thing I am resolved to put an end to . Ballad - singers and broom - girls you will of course have taken into custody without hesitation . In fact you had better give the policeman upon the beat general instructions upon this head ; and you can slip a guinea into his hand at the same time . "
261947	261953	261780	261780	Lafleur	1064	" Very good , sir . "
261954	261971	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" At the same time we must be charitable , Lafleur — we must be charitable . "
261972	261977	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" Decidedly , sir . "
261978	262088	261780	261780	Lafleur	1064	" You must find out some decent woman with half a dozen children , to whom the broken victuals can be given every day at about three o'clock , when there are plenty of people in the street;—a woman who does not exactly want the food , but who will not refuse it . The respectability of her appearance will be set down to my benevolence , Lafleur ; and she must be careful always to come with her children . By these means we shall gain the reputation of being judiciously particular in respect to vagabonds and impostors , but charitable in the extreme to the deserving poor . "
262089	262095	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" Just so , sir . "
262096	262172	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" One word more , Lafleur . When any person calls whom you know I do not want to see , say , ' Mr. Greenwood is engaged with a deputation from his constituents ; ' or else , ' Mr. Greenwood has just received very important dispatches , and can not be disturbed;'—or , again , ' Mr. Greenwood has just stepped down as far as the Home Office . ' You fully comprehend . "
262173	262178	261780	261780	Lafleur	1064	" Perfectly , sir . "
262179	262195	261780	261780	Lafleur	1064	" Then you may retire , Lafleur . But — by the bye — Lafleur ! "
262196	262201	261394	261394	Greenwood	903	" Yes , sir ? "
262202	262219	262221	262222	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I shall add twenty guineas a year to your wages from this date , Lafleur , "
262224	262230	262232	262233	the valet	5525	" Thank you , sir , "
262245	262255	262257	262257	Greenwood	903	" Another step gained in the ladder of ambition ! "
262266	262756	262259	262259	himself	903	" A Member of Parliament — and in spite of Lord Tremordyn ! ha ! ha ! ha ! In spite of Lord Tremordyn ! Oh most intelligent and independent electors of Rottenborough : I bought your suffrages with gold , with fine words , with clowns and mountebanks , and with pots of beer ! Free and enlightened electors ! ha ! ha ! I shall turn against the very interest in which I was elected ; but if my constituents grumble , I will silence them with more gold;—if they reproach , I will use all the sophistry of which language is capable — and that is not a little;—if they repine , I will win them back to good humour with fresh sights , and buffoons , and galas;—if they grow dry with talking against me , I will have whole pipes of wine and butts of beer broached in their streets ! Yes — I must join the Tory interest : I see that it is now upon the rise . And yet I know — I feel in my heart — I have the conviction that the popular cause is the true one , the just one . But what of that ? I stood forward as a candidate to suit myself , and not for the sake of the free and independent electors of Rottenborough ! Yes , all goes well with me ! An occasional annoyance — such as my failure in obtaining possession of the person of Eliza Sydney , and of the hand of Isabella , the lovely Italian — cannot be avoided;—but in all great points — in all my important views , I am successful ! And yet , Isabella — Isabella ! Upon her the eye that is wearied with the contemplation of the rude and discordant scenes of life , could rest — could rest with unfeigned , with ineffable delight ! O Isabella , there are times when thine image comes before me , like the vision of a holy and chaste Madonna to the sleep - bound mind of the pious Catholic;—and there have been solitary hours in which the whole earth has seemed to me to be covered with flowers beneath the sweet sunlight of thine eyes ! And yet — who knows ? The day may come when even thou shalt be mine ! I longed to languish in the arms of Diana Arlington;—and I had my wish . I coveted the patrician loveliness of Cecilia Harborough;—and , behold ! my wealth purchased it . I sought for change ; and accident — a strange accident — surrendered to my embraces another — yes , another — whom I have never seen since that day — now more than two months ago,—but who , I have since learnt through the medium of my faithful Lafleur , dwells in the same house with — "
262820	262828	262830	262831	Mr. Sawder	1172	" The liberal cause triumphed most signally , "
262833	262850	262830	262831	Mr. Sawder	1172	" the result was hailed with enthusiasm at the Reform Club , I can assure you . "
262851	262857	262859	262860	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I have no doubt , "
262876	262918	262830	262831	Mr. Sawder	1172	circles,—"I have no doubt that every true lover of his country must be rejoiced at the victory achieved by straightforward conduct over the system of bribery , intimidation , and corruption practised by the nominee of Lord Tremordyn and his agents . "
262919	262926	262928	262929	Mr. Sawder	1172	" Oh ! certainly — certainly , "
262931	262955	262928	262929	Mr. Sawder	1172	" The object of my present visit is to ascertain whether you will permit me to introduce you to the House this evening ? "
262956	262971	262973	262974	Mr. Greenwood	903	" It is my intention to take the oaths and my seat this evening , "
262976	262983	262973	262974	Mr. Greenwood	903	" And my services as chaperon — "
262984	262994	262928	262929	Mr. Sawder	1172	" You really confer a great honour upon me . "
262995	263004	262973	262974	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Then I may consider that you accept — "
263005	263027	262973	262974	Mr. Greenwood	903	" My dear sir , how can I sufficiently thank you for this kind interest which you take in my behalf ? "
263028	263038	262928	262929	Mr. Sawder	1172	" Pray do not mention it , Mr. Greenwood . "
263039	263078	262973	262974	Mr. Greenwood	903	" No , Mr. Sawder , I will not allude to it ; since it is the more to be appreciated , inasmuch as I never had the pleasure of being known to you previous to this occasion . "
263079	263086	263088	263091	the whipper - in	8191	" I am therefore to understand , "
263109	263121	263088	263091	the whipper - in	8191	" that you will allow me the honour of introducing you — "
263122	263135	263137	263138	Mr. Greenwood	903	" The honour , my dear sir , would be with me , "
263145	263157	263137	263138	Mr. Greenwood	903	" At what hour , then , will you be prepared — "
263158	263173	263088	263091	the whipper - in	8191	" My time shall henceforth always be devoted to the interests of my constituents . "
263174	263185	263187	263190	the whipper - in	8191	" A very noble sentiment , my dear Mr. Greenwood , "
263192	263203	263187	263190	the whipper - in	8191	" Shall we then fix the ceremony for five o'clock ? "
263204	263231	263233	263234	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Five o'clock is an excellent hour , Mr. Sawder — an excellent hour . I know no hour that I like more than five o'clock , "
263236	263243	263245	263248	the whipper - in	8191	" Be it five , then , "
263250	263271	263245	263248	the whipper - in	8191	" And now , relative to the Reform club — when will it please you to be proposed a member ? "
263272	263303	263233	263234	Mr. Greenwood	903	" It will please me , my dear sir , at any time , to join that fraternity of honourable gentlemen with whom I shall in future co - operate . "
263304	263313	263315	263316	Mr. Sawder	1172	" Well and good , my dear sir , "
263452	263477	263443	263443	his	1173	" the object of which was to maintain the glorious old constitution inviolate , and uphold the Established Church in its unity and integrity . "
263478	263485	263487	263488	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Those are precisely my intentions , "
263490	263504	263506	263510	the Tory whipper - in	8199	" I am delighted to hear you say so , my dear sir , "
263512	263560	263506	263510	the Tory whipper - in	8199	" but I have one deep cause of uneasiness , which is that you may not entertain precisely the same views of what is necessary to maintain these honourable and ancient institutions , as the men who would gladly lay down their lives to benefit their country . "
263561	263569	263571	263572	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I believe , Sir Thomas Muzzlehem , "
263574	263606	263571	263572	Mr. Greenwood	903	" that I shall act according to the wishes of my constituents , the dictates of my own conscience , and the views of the illustrious men of whom you speak . "
263607	263647	263506	263510	the Tory whipper - in	8199	" In which case , my dear Mr. Greenwood , I am of course to understand that you will be one of us — one of the true defenders of the Throne , the Constitution , and the Church — "
263648	263656	263658	263659	Mr. Greenwood	903	" In other words , a Conservative , "
263661	263664	263666	263669	the whipper - in	8191	" Bravo ! "
263707	263722	263704	263704	he	8191	" At what hour shall I have the pleasure of introducing you this evening ? "
263723	263731	263733	263734	Mr. Greenwood	903	" At a quarter to five precisely , "
263736	263749	263751	263754	the whipper - in	8191	" And of course you will become a member of the Carlton ? "
263756	263769	263771	263772	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Of course — whenever you choose — as early as possible , "
263807	263824	263798	263798	Lafleur	1064	" A lady , sir , is waiting to see you in the drawing - room . "
263825	263829	263831	263832	Mr. Greenwood	903	" A lady ! "
263834	263839	263831	263832	Mr. Greenwood	903	" who is she ? "
263840	263864	263798	263798	Lafleur	1064	" I do not know , sir . She refused to give me her name ; and I have never seen her before . "
263865	263871	263798	263798	Lafleur	1064	" How did she come ? "
263872	263899	263798	263798	Lafleur	1064	" On foot , sir . She is neatly , but plainly dressed ; and yet her manners seem to indicate that she is a lady . "
263900	263908	263910	263910	Greenwood	903	" Strange ! who can she be ? "
264165	264168	264170	264170	Greenwood	903	" Ellen ! "
264176	264182	264170	264170	Greenwood	903	hers.—"what has brought you hither ? "
264183	264199	264201	264202	Miss Monroe	1117	" Can you not imagine it possible that I should wish to see you again ? "
264216	264254	264256	264256	Greenwood	903	" But why so much mystery , Ellen ? why refuse to give the servant your name ? why adopt a course which can not fail to render your visit a matter of suspicion to my household ? "
264261	264274	264276	264276	Ellen	1117	" Forgive me — forgive me , if I have done wrong , "
264285	264319	264276	264276	Ellen	1117	" Alas ! misfortunes have rendered me so suspicious of human nature , that I feared — I feared lest you should refuse to see me — that you would consider me importunate — "
264320	264355	264362	264362	he	903	" Well — well , Ellen : do not cry — that is foolish ! I am not angry now ; so cheer up , and tell me in what I can serve thee ? "
264440	264456	264458	264458	Ellen	1117	" Oh ! if you would only smile thus upon me — now and then — "
264463	264478	264437	264438	the libertine	5287	him,—"how much of the sorrow of this life would disappear from before my eyes . "
264479	264492	264494	264494	Greenwood	903	" How can one gifted with such charms as you be unhappy ? "
264496	264507	264509	264509	Ellen	1117	" What ! do you imagine that beauty constitutes felicity ? "
264516	264620	264509	264509	Ellen	1117	" Are not the loveliest flowers exposed to the nipping frosts , as well as the rank and poisonous weeds ? Do not clouds obscure the brightest stars , as well as those of a pale and sickly lustre ? You ask me if I can be unhappy ? Alas ! it is now long — long since I knew what perfect happiness was ! I need not tell you — you — how my father 's fortune was swept away;—but I may detail to you the miseries which the loss of it raised up around him and me — and chiefly me ! "
264621	264669	264784	264784	she	1117	" But why dwell upon so sad a theme , Ellen ? Did you come hither to divert me with a narrative of sorrows which must now be past , since — according to what I have heard — your father and yourself have found an asylum — "
264670	264675	264677	264678	Miss Monroe	1117	" At Markham Place ! "
264682	264709	264677	264678	Miss Monroe	1117	" Yes — we have found an asylum there — there , in the house of the individual whom my father 's speculations and your agency — "
264710	264725	264728	264728	Greenwood	903	" Speak not of that — speak not of that , I conjure you ! "
264730	264754	264728	264728	Greenwood	903	" Tell me Ellen — tell me , you have not breathed a word to your father , nor to that young man — "
264755	264762	264764	264764	Ellen	1117	" No — not for worlds ! "
264787	264875	264784	264784	she	1117	" But you ask me why I wish to narrate to you the history of all the miseries I have endured for two long years , and upwards : you demand of me why I would dwell upon so sad a theme . I will tell you presently . You shall hear me first . But pray , be not impatient : I shall not detain you long;—and , surely — surely , you can spare an hour to one who is so very — very miserable . "
264876	264883	264728	264728	Greenwood	903	" Speak , Ellen — speak ! "
264884	265030	264784	264784	she	1117	" The loss of our fortune plunged us into the most frightful poverty . We were not let down gradually from affluence to penury;—but we fell — as one falls from a height — abruptly , suddenly , and precipitately into the depths of want and starvation . The tree of our happiness lost not its foliage leaf by leaf : it was blighted in an hour . This made the sting so much more sharp — the heavy weight of misfortune so much less tolerable . Nevertheless , I worked , and worked with my needle until my energies were wasted , my eyes grew dim , and my health was sinking fast . Oh ! my God , I only asked for work;—and yet , at length , I lost even that resource ! Then commenced a strange kind of life for me . "
265031	265044	265046	265046	Greenwood	903	" A strange kind of life , Ellen — what mean you ? "
265054	265061	265063	265063	Ellen	1117	" I sold myself in detail , "
265076	265083	265085	265085	Greenwood	903	" I can not understand you , "
265087	265097	265085	265085	Greenwood	903	" Surely — surely your mind is not wandering ! "
265098	265110	265117	265117	her	30054	" No : all I tell you is unhappily too true , "
265138	265158	265128	265128	she	30054	" You have a plaster of Paris image as large as life , in the window of your staircase ? "
265159	265177	265179	265179	Greenwood	903	" Yes — it is a Diana , and holds a lamp which is lighted at night , "
265181	265198	265128	265128	she	30054	" But what means that strange question — so irrelevant to the subject of our discourse ? "
265199	265208	265210	265210	Ellen	1117	" More — more than you can imagine , "
265214	265223	265226	265226	her	1117	" That statue explains one phase in my chequered life;"—then
265265	265276	265262	265262	she	1117	" The face of your beautiful Diana is my own ! "
265358	265370	265371	265371	she	1117	" Do you see any thing that strikes you strangely there ? "
265381	265397	265399	265399	Greenwood	903	" The scene is Venus rising from the ocean , surrounded by nereids and nymphs , "
265401	265409	265371	265371	she	1117	" And you admire your picture much ? "
265410	265424	265466	265466	he	903	" Yes — much ; or else I should not have purchased it . "
265425	265433	265435	265435	Ellen	1117	" Then have you unwittingly admired me , "
265437	265448	265435	265435	Ellen	1117	" for the face of your Venus is my own ! "
265469	265546	265466	265466	he	903	" True — it is true ! There are your eyes — your mouth — your smile — your forehead — your very hair ! How strange that I never noticed this before . But — no — it is a dream : it is a mere coincidence ! Tell me — how could this have taken place;—speak — is it not a mere delusion — an accidental resemblance which you noticed on entering this room ? "
265547	265552	265554	265554	Ellen	1117	" Come with me , "
265630	265638	265640	265640	Ellen	1117	" Whence did you obtain that statue ! "
265650	265668	265670	265670	Greenwood	903	" The ruin of a family long reputed rich , caused the sale of all their effects , "
265672	265693	265670	265670	Greenwood	903	" and I purchased that statue , amongst other objects of value which were sold , for a mere trifle . "
265694	265704	265706	265706	Ellen	1117	" The lady has paid dearly for her vanity ! "
265708	265750	265706	265706	Ellen	1117	" her fate — or rather the fate of her statue is a just reward for the contempt , the scorn — the withering scorn with which she treated me , when I implored her to take me into her service . "
265751	265759	265670	265670	Greenwood	903	" What do you mean , Ellen ? "
265760	265774	265776	265778	the young lady	4262	" I mean that the bust of your marble statue is my own , "
265789	265793	265795	265795	Greenwood	903	" Another enigma ! "
265818	265826	265830	265830	Greenwood	903	" Will you tell me , Ellen , "
265845	265864	265830	265830	Greenwood	903	hour,—"will you tell me , Ellen , whether you have lost your reason , or I am dreaming ? "
265865	265870	265872	265872	Ellen	1117	" Lost my reason ! "
265880	265896	265872	265872	Ellen	1117	" no — that were perhaps a blessing ; and naught save misery awaits me ! "
265897	265909	265911	265911	Greenwood	903	" But the image — the picture — and the statue ? "
265914	265924	265926	265926	Ellen	1117	" They are emblems of phases in my life , "
265928	266011	265926	265926	Ellen	1117	" I told you ere now that my father and myself were reduced to the very lowest depths of poverty . And yet we could not die;—at least I could not see that poor , white - haired , tottering old man perish by inches — die the death of starvation . Oh ! no — that was too horrible . I cried for bread — bread — bread ! And there was one — an old hag — you know her — "
266012	266019	265872	265872	Ellen	1117	" Go on — go on . "
266020	266050	265926	265926	Ellen	1117	" Who offered me bread — bread for myself , bread for my father — upon strange and wild conditions . In a word I sold myself in detail . "
266051	266057	266059	266059	Greenwood	903	" Again that strange phrase ! "
266061	266068	266059	266059	Greenwood	903	" What mean you , Ellen ? "
266069	266103	265926	265926	Ellen	1117	" I mean that I sold my face to the statuary — my likeness to the artist — my bust to the sculptor — my whole form to the photographer — and — — "
266104	266107	266109	266109	Greenwood	903	" And — "
266114	266121	266123	266125	the young woman	7947	" And my virtue to you ! "
266149	266156	266158	266158	Greenwood	903	" Ah ! now I understand , "
266169	266173	266158	266158	Greenwood	903	" how horrible ! "
266174	266178	266180	266180	Ellen	1117	" Horrible indeed ! "
266182	266348	266180	266180	Ellen	1117	" But what other women sell first . I sold last : what others give in a moment of delirium , and in an excess of burning , ardent passion , I coolly and deliberately exchanged for the price of bread ! But you know this sad — this saddest episode in my strange history ! Maddened by the sight of my father 's sufferings , I flew to the accursed old hag : I said , ' Give me bread , and do with me as thou wilt ! ' She took me with her . I accompanied her , reckless of the way we went , to a house where I was shown into a chamber that was darkened ; there I remained an hour alone , a prey to all the horrible ideas that ever yet combined to drive poor mortal mad , and still failed to accomplish their dread aim;—the hour passed — a man came — you know the rest ! "
266349	266371	266123	266125	the young woman	7947	" Say no more , Ellen , on that head : but tell me , to what does all this tend ? "
266372	266423	266158	266158	Greenwood	903	" One word more . Hours passed away , as you are well aware : you would not let me go . At length I returned home . My God ! my poor father was happy ! He had met an angel , while I had encountered a devil — — "
266424	266429	266180	266180	Ellen	1117	" Ellen ! Ellen ! "
266430	266624	266158	266158	Greenwood	903	" He had gold — he was happy , I say ! He had purchased a succulent repast — he had spread it with his own hand — he had heaped up his luxuries , in his humble way , to greet the return of his dear — his darling child . Heavens ! how did I survive that moment ? how dared I stand in the presence of that old man — that good , that kind old man — whose hair was so white with many winters , and whose brow was so wrinkled with many sorrows ? I can not say how passed the few hours that followed my return ! Flower after flower had dropped from the garland of my purity — that purity in which he — the kind old man — had nurtured me ! And then there was the dread — the crushing — the overwhelming conviction that had I retained my faith in God for a few hours more — had I only exercised my patience until the evening of that fatal day , I had been spared that final guilt — that crowning infamy ! "
266717	266734	266735	266735	he	903	" Ellen , what can I do for you ? what would you have with me ? "
266763	266826	266745	266745	She	1117	" If you touch me under the influence of the sentiment that made you purchase my only jewel , lay not a finger on me — defile me not — let my sorrows make my person sacred ! But if you entertain one spark of feeling — one single idea of honour , do me justice — resign me not to despair ! "
266827	266834	266739	266739	his	903	" Do you justice , Ellen ? "
266835	266858	266860	266860	Ellen	1117	" Yes — do me justice ; for I was pure and spotless till want and misery threw me into your arms , "
266867	266901	266860	266860	Ellen	1117	" and if I sinned — if I surrendered myself up to him who offered me a price — it was only that I might obtain bread — bread for my poor father ! "
266902	266912	266739	266739	his	903	" Ellen , what would you have me do ? "
266913	266921	266922	266922	she	1117	" What would I have you do ! "
266927	267043	266922	266922	she	1117	" oh ! can not you comprehend what I would have you do to save my honour ? It is in your power to restore me to happiness;—it is you who this day — this hour — must decide my doom ! You ask me what I would have you do ? Here , upon my knees I answer you — here , at your feet I implore you , by all your hopes of prosperity in this world and salvation in the next — by all you bold dear , solemn , and sacred — I implore you to bestow a father 's honourable name upon the child which I bear in my womb ! "
267075	267082	267084	267084	Greenwood	903	" Rise , Ellen — rise , "
267086	267096	267084	267084	Greenwood	903	" some one may come — some one may — "
267097	267112	267056	267056	she	8232	" Never will I rise from this position until your tongue pronounces my fate ! "
267113	267124	267056	267056	she	8232	" You do not — you can not mean — — "
267125	267132	267134	267134	Ellen	1117	" That you should marry me ! "
267136	267282	267134	267134	Ellen	1117	" Yes — that is the prayer which I now offer to you ! Oh ! if you will but restore me to the path of honour , I will be your slave . If my presence be an annoyance to you , I will never see you more from the moment when we quit the altar : but if you will admit me to your confidence — if you will make me the partner of your hopes and fears , your joys and sorrows , I will smile when you smile — I will console you when you weep . I will serve you — upon my knees will I serve you;—I will never weary of doing your bidding . But — O God ! do not , do not refuse me the only prayer which I have now to offer to mortal man ! "
267283	267313	267056	267056	she	8232	" Ellen , this is impossible ! My position — my interest — my plans render marriage — at present — a venture in which I can not embark . "
267314	267329	267331	267331	Ellen	1117	" You reject my supplication — you throw me back into disgrace and despair , "
267333	267344	267331	267331	Ellen	1117	" Oh ! reflect well upon what you are doing ! "
267345	267350	267352	267353	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Listen to me , "
267355	267404	267352	267353	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Ask me any thing that money can purchase , and you shall have it . Say the word , and you shall have a house — a home — furnished in all imaginable splendour ; and measures shall be taken to conceal your situation from the world . "
267405	267415	267417	267417	Ellen	1117	" No — this is not what I ask , "
267419	267441	267417	267417	Ellen	1117	" The wealth of the universe can not recompense me if I am to pass as Mr. Greenwood 's pensioned mistress ! "
267442	267459	267461	267464	the Member of Parliament	8234	" Then what , in the name of heaven , do you now require of me ? "
267467	267475	267417	267417	Ellen	1117	" That you should do me justice , "
267488	267493	267495	267495	Greenwood	903	" Do you justice ! "
267497	267581	267495	267495	Greenwood	903	" and how have I wronged you ? If I deliberately set to work to seduce you — if , by art and treachery , I wiled you away from the paths of duty — if , by false promises , I allured you from a prosperous and happy sphere,—then might you talk to me of justice . But no : I knew not whom I was about to meet when the old hag came to me that day , and said — — "
267582	267591	267593	267593	Ellen	1117	" Enough ! enough ! I understand you , "
267608	267759	267593	267593	Ellen	1117	" You consider that you purchased me as you would have bought any poor girl who , through motives of vanity , gain , or lust , would have sold her person to the highest bidder ! Oh — now I understand you ! But , one word , Mr. Greenwood ! If there were no such voluptuaries — such heartless libertines as you in this world , would there be so many poor unhappy creatures like me ? In an access of despair — of folly — and of madness , I rushed upon a path which men like you alone open to women placed as I then was ! Perhaps you consider that I am not worthy to become your wife ? Fool that I was to seek redress — to hope for consolation at your hands ! Your conduct to others — to my father — to — "
267760	267814	267822	267822	Ellen	1117	" Ellen ! I command you to be silent ! Remember our solemn compact on that day when we met in so strange and mysterious a manner;—remember that we pledged ourselves to mutual silence — silence with respect to all we know of each other ! Do you wish to break that compact ? "
267815	267820	267822	267822	Ellen	1117	" No — no , "
267830	267893	267822	267822	Ellen	1117	" I would not have you publish my disgrace ! Happily I have yet friends who will — but no matter . Sir , I now leave you : I have your answer . You refuse to give a father 's name to the child which I bear ? You may live to repent your decision . For the present , farewell . "

She is apparently about twenty seven or twenty - eight years of age , very beautiful , and unmarried . She travelled in a handsome carriage , attended by one female servant and an elderly valet . Although arrived at that mature age , she has preserved all the freshness of her youthful charms — a circumstance which renders her presence here the more dangerous , for certain reasons which the undersigned will detail to your Excellency on a future occasion . This charming English woman brought letters of introduction to certain noble families at Montoni , and immediately obtained admittance into the very first society of this capital . She has taken up her residence at the villa possessed by the Earl of Warrington , in the suburbs of Montoni , and is , it is believed , nearly related to that English nobleman . The service now required of your Excellency is to ascertain all particulars that can be gleaned concerning her . This is of the utmost — the very utmost importance . As a guide to your proceedings , it may be as well to mention that Miss Sydney this morning sent a letter to the post - office addressed to a Mrs. Arlington , residing in Dover Street , London . "

272217	272240	272214	272215	Lord Ruperto	1186	" The Examiner turned over the letters ; and , at length , extracted a particular one from the heap , observing , "
272245	272267	272214	272215	Lord Ruperto	1186	" He then passed it to the clerks , by whom it was opened . The contents were as follows : — "
272275	272736	272268	272268	Montoni	136	" Exactly a month ago , my dearest Diana , I wrote to you a hasty note to state my safe arrival in this city , after a very pleasant journey through the delicious climes of France , Switzerland , and Northern Italy . It was at about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th of February that the carriage reached the brow of a hill from whence the eye commanded a magnificent view of a vast plain , rich with fertility , bounded at the further extremity by the horizon , and on the right hand stretching down to the sea , the blue of which seemed a pure reflection of the cloudless heavens above . At the mouth of a superb river , which , after meandering through that delicious plain , amidst groves and pleasant meadows , flowed into the calm and tranquil sea , the tall towers and white buildings of Montoni met my eyes . It is impossible to conceive any thing more charming or picturesque than the sight of this peerless city of Italy . The river 's verdant banks are dotted with magnificent villas and mansions , with which are connected beautiful gardens teeming with the choicest fruits and flowers , even at this season of the year ! For here , my dear Diana , it is perfect summer ! I ordered the carriage to stop for at least a quarter of an hour upon the hill , that I might enjoy the magnificent view of the vast plain and the beautiful city . Far above the edifices around , rose the two towers of the ancient cathedral of St. Theodosia — their dark and gloomy masses forming a striking contrast with the extensive white buildings of the ducal palace in the immediate foreground . The port of the city was crowded with shipping , the flags of all nations waving from the forest of masts that indicated the existence of an extensive commerce . While I was yet gazing upon the scene , the roar of distant artillery reached my ears . The Grand Duke ( as I afterwards learnt ) was just coming back from a water excursion in his beautiful yatch , a small steamer rigged as a frigate ; and the batteries of the port , and the ships of war in the offing thundered forth a salute in honour of the royal return . Two line - of - battle ships , one French and the other English , and three frigates of the Castelcicalan navy , had all their yards manned , and displayed their gayest colours . Altogether the scene was one of the most enchanting and exhilarating that I have ever yet beheld . "
272977	273069	273096	273096	his	28357	" The carriage proceeded , crossed the river over a suspension bridge , and , having passed the official dwellings of the Ministers of War , Commerce , Marine , and Finance , entered the southern suburbs of the metropolis of Castelcicala . I could not have conceived that any city could have possibly equalled London or Paris in the magnificence of its shops and the amount of wealth displayed in their windows;—but certainly , Montoni is a miniature counterpart of the finest portions of either the English or French capital . "
273176	273254	273159	273159	I	0	" And the Earl told you that it was a little villa , Diana ! It is a superb mansion . The rooms are magnificently furnished ; the gardens are spacious and full of all that is delicious in the shape of fruit or enchanting in the guise of flowers . I wandered for hours in those inviting grounds the morning after my arrival . But would you have me depict my new abode ? Listen : — "
273527	273745	273753	273754	General Grachia	1187	" When I had rested myself for two or three days , and completely recovered from the fatigues of travelling , I delivered my letters of introduction to the families to whom they were addressed . And here I have another instance of the Earl of Warrington 's noble conduct to record . The letters all represented me as the near relation of the Earl of Warrington ! I was received with open arms by all to whom I was thus introduced ; and each kind Italian family seemed only anxious to make me happy ! Oh ! what virtue must there have been in those letters , which Count Alteroni had written , no doubt according to the dictation of the Earl . But , ah ! Diana , relative to those letters there is a secret , which I do not choose to trust to paper , but which the Earl has perhaps already explained to you . Oh ! I do not wonder now that I was not to seek to penetrate their contents , in England ( neither did I myself ever open them at all ) ; nor is it a matter of marvel that those recommendations should prove such strong passports to the favour of those to whom they were addressed ! "

When he drew near the carriage in which General Grachia 's family and myself were seated , he rode up to it , and entered into conversation with the General 's lady . Presently he glanced toward me , and immediately bent down and whispered to Signora Grachia . The result was my formal introduction to the Grand Duke of Castelcicala . He inquired very kindly after the Earl of Warrington , whom he remembered perfectly . I blushed deeply as I answered his questions , for I was ashamed of the imperfect manner in which I speak the Italian language — for all that I know , as well as the little French with which I am acquainted , I taught myself during my residence at the villa at Clapton . The Grand Duke , however , seemed to comprehend me perfectly . Having conversed with us at least a quarter of an hour , he again whispered something to General Grachia 's lady ; and then rode on . "
274436	274635	274636	274636	I	0	" I need scarcely say that the entertainment itself was magnificent . Such a blaze of beauty I never saw before . Oh ! what charming creatures are the Italian women ; and Montoni is justly famed for its female loveliness ! The Grand Duke is a widower , and has no children . The honours of the evening were entrusted to the lady of the Minister of the Interior , who is also the President of the Council . The Duke opened the ball with that lady . You may laugh at the idea of a prince of sixty dancing : but in Italy every body dances . I was invited by the major of General Grachia 's regiment for the first quadrille , and by Baron Ruperto , under secretary of state for foreign affairs , for the second . The third and fourth I declined dancing , being somewhat overcome with the heat of the apartments . But the fifth quadrille I danced : this time I could not refuse . No — it was not an invitation that I received — it was a command ! I danced with the Grand Duke of Castelcicala ! "

He informed me that they were sent by order of his highness , and the messenger was expressly commanded to make inquiries concerning my health . I thanked him most sincerely for this act of kindness on the part of his illustrious master ; and when he had taken his departure , I sate in a delicious summer - house the entire morning , wondering to what circumstance I could have been indebted for such a token of royal favour . "
274933	275351	274921	274921	I	0	" Two days more passed , when I received an intimation from Signora Grachia that there was to be a select conversazione in the evening at the palace , and that I was specially invited . I accompanied General Grachia 's family ; and the moment we entered the room , the Grand Duke accosted us . After conversing with us for a few moments , he offered me his arm , saying that he would conduct me to inspect his sculpture - gallery . This splendid museum communicated with the apartment wherein the company ( which was by no means numerous on the occasion ) was assembled . His Highness led me into the gallery , and explained all its curiosities . The works of art , by some of the most eminent masters , are very valuable . His Highness evidently prolonged the inspection as much as possible ; and his language was occasionally interspersed with a compliment calculated to flatter me — nay , Diana , to make me very vain ! When we returned to the drawing - rooms , the Duke led me to a sofa , seated himself by me , and conversed with me for a considerable time . He asked me many questions relative to my family — whether my father and mother were still living , whether I had any brothers or sisters , and in what degree of relationship I stood towards the Earl of Warrington ? He then asked me how it was that I had not as yet launched my fortunes in the bark of matrimony ? I blushed deeply at this question , and replied that I had never as yet encountered any one with whom I had chosen to link my destinies . He then spoke of the peculiar position of princes , observing with a deep sigh , that they could not always follow the bent of their inclinations , nor obey the natural dictates of their affections . During the remainder of the evening I was the object of universal attention — I could not then conceive wherefore — on the part of the noble and beauteous guests assembled . Every one manifested the most respectful courtesy towards me ; and General Grachia 's family were more kind to me than ever . Ah ! a vague suspicion darted across my mind:—could it be possible ? Oh ! no — no ! that were the height of the most insane presumption ! "

275553	275700	275543	275551	her Majesty 's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs	8577	" THE verdure of the early spring re - clothed the trees with their gay garments , and gave back its air of cheerfulness to the residence of Count Alteroni . It was about mid - day ; and the sun beamed brightly from a heaven of unclouded blue . Nature appeared to be reviving from the despotism of winter 's rule ; and the primrose peeped bashfully forth to welcome the return of the feathered chorister of the grove . The count and countess , with their lovely daughter , were seated in the breakfast - parlour . The two ladies were occupied with their embroidery : the noble Italian exile himself was reading the Montoni Gazette , which that morning 's post had brought him . Suddenly he uttered an exclamation of surprise , and then appeared to read with additional interest and attention . "

Scarcely had the conversation thus received a rude check and the count resumed the perusal of his paper , when Sir Cherry Bounce and Captain Smilax Dapper were announced . "

277787	277803	277784	277785	Mr. Chichester	886	" exclaimed Isabella , on whom the mention of these names produced a strange effect . "
277806	277811	277784	277785	Mr. Chichester	886	" answered Captain Dapper ; "
277835	277881	277899	277899	count	29320	" Isabella 's countenance was suddenly irradiated with a gleam of the purest and most heart - felt joy;—the tears started to her eyes — but they were tears of happiness;—and , fearful that her emotions would be observed , she hurried from the room . "
277901	277916	277897	277897	you	0	" demanded Dapper , still continuing the conversation . The count shook his head . "
277923	277931	277897	277897	you	0	" said the gallant captain of hussars . "

278392	278396	278390	278390	Cherry	1051	" returned Dapper : "
278523	278563	278518	278518	himself	1051	" Isabella had returned to the apartment and resumed her seat a few moments before this story was finished ; and Captain Dapper appeared very much annoyed and surprised that she did not condescend to laugh at the recital . "
278568	278578	278518	278518	himself	1051	" he observed , after a moment 's pause , "

278600	278644	278597	278598	Wichard Markham	1087	" said Sir Cherry . The count made a movement of impatience ; the countess looked up from her embroidery ; and a deep blush mantled upon the cheek , and a sudden tremor passed through the frame , of the lovely Isabella . "
278651	278657	278648	278649	Richard Markham	874	" continued the hussar officer . "
278673	278674	278658	278658	I	0	" "
278683	278684	278676	278676	we	8697	" "

278721	278727	278707	278707	herself	8699	" said the count impatiently ; "
278744	278745	278737	278738	his wife	27679	" "
278748	278752	278737	278738	his wife	27679	" continued Dapper ; "
278798	278799	278792	278792	him	874	" "
278817	278822	278814	278815	Captain Dapper	1053	" said the count : "
278845	279450	278834	278834	Isabella	1066	" But no reply was given to the request of the count , who was seated in such a way that he could not see his daughter 's place at the work - table . Isabella had again left the room . Of what nature were the emotions which agitated the bosom of that beauteous — that amiable creature ? Wherefore had she first sought her own chamber to conceal tears of joy ? And why had she now retired once more , to hide the out - pourings of an intense anguish ? WHEN Isabella retired to her chamber the second time , she hastily put on her bonnet and shawl , and then hurried to the garden at the back of the mansion ; for she felt the necessity of fresh air , to cool her burning brow . She walked slowly up and down for a few minutes , her mind filled with the most distressing thoughts , when the sounds of voices fell upon her ears . She listened ; and the consequential tone of the hussar - captain , alternating with the childish lisp of Sir Cherry Bounce , warned her that the two young coxcombs had also directed their steps towards the garden . She felt in no humour to listen to their chattering gossip — wearisome at all times , but intolerable in a moment of mental affliction ; still she could not return to the house without encountering them in her way . A thought struck her — the gardener had been at work all the morning ; and the back - gate of the enclosure had been left open for his convenience . Perhaps it was not locked again ? Thither did she hurry ; and , to her joy , the means of egress into the fields were open to her . The delicate foot of that beauteous creature of seventeen scarcely made an impression upon the grass , nor even crushed the daisy , so light was her tread ! And yet her heart was heavy . Grief sate upon her brow ; and her bosom was agitated with sighs . She walked onward ; and , turning the angle of a grove , was now beyond the view of any one in her father 's garden . She relaxed her speed , and moved slowly and mournfully along the outskirts of the grove , vainly endeavouring to conquer the sorrowful ideas that obtruded themselves on her imagination . But Woe is an enemy that knows no remorse , gives no quarter , while it retains poor mortal in its grasp ; and when its victim is a young and innocent girl , whose heart beats with its first , its virgin love,—that direful enemy augments its pangs in proportion to the tenderness and sensibility of that heart which it thus ruthlessly torments . Isabella 's reverie was suddenly interrupted by a deep sigh . She turned her head ; and there , on her left hand — seated upon the trunk of a tree that had been blown down by the late winds,—with his face buried in his hands , was a gentleman apparently absorbed in reflections of no pleasurable nature . He sighed deeply , and his lips murmured some words , the sound of which , but not the meaning , met her ears . She was about to retrace her steps , when her own name was pronounced by the lips of the person seated on the tree,—and in a tone , too , which she could not mistake . "
279465	279538	279539	279539	Isabella	1066	" An exclamation of surprise — almost of alarm — burst from the lips of the beautiful Italian ; and she leant for support against a tree . Richard Markham — for it was by his lips that her name had been pronounced — raised his head , and gave vent to a cry of the most wild , the most enthusiastic joy . In a moment he was by her side . "
279541	279545	279539	279539	Isabella	1066	" he exclaimed : "
279562	279563	279548	279549	good angel	8709	" "

279621	279674	279588	279588	Isabella	1066	" repeated the signora , with a shudder . Markham dropped the hand which he had taken — which he had pressed for a moment in his : and he retreated a few paces , his entire manner changing as if he were suddenly awakened to a sense of his humiliating condition . "
279677	279688	279588	279588	Isabella	1066	" he said , in a low and tremulous tone , "
279709	279710	279693	279693	you	1066	" "
279718	279725	279715	279716	Mr. Markham	874	" answered the young lady hastily ; "

279761	279765	279753	279753	you	1066	" exclaimed Richard . "

279889	279895	279858	279858	I	0	" interrupted Richard , coldly . "

279992	280017	279984	279985	Mr. Markham	874	" said Isabella , timidly , and with her eyes bent towards the ground so that the long black fringes reposed upon her cheeks . "
280050	280054	280058	280058	signora	5958	" ejaculated Markham . "
280368	280369	280370	280371	Mr. Markham	874	" "
280373	280384	280386	280386	Markham	874	" said Isabella , in a voice scarcely audible through deep emotion,—"Mr

280418	280440	280441	280441	You	874	" exclaimed Markham , his tone softening , for he saw that the lovely idol of his heart was deeply touched . "
280521	280522	280568	280568	signora	5958	" "
280533	280541	280568	280568	signora	5958	" cried Isabella , now weeping bitterly ; "

280559	280563	280568	280568	signora	5958	" exclaimed Richard ; "

280584	280590	280581	280582	Mr. Markham	874	" returned the lovely girl . "
280597	280620	280566	280566	you	874	" said Richard , eagerly catching at the first straw which presented itself upon the ocean that had wrecked all his hopes ; "
280632	280633	280622	280622	you	874	" "
280639	280653	280622	280622	you	874	" answered Isabella , whose voice was almost entirely subdued by her emotions ; "
280669	280670	280663	280663	you	874	" "
280690	280708	280709	280709	Signora	1066	" cried Richard ; then , advancing towards Isabella , he took her hand , and said , "
280746	280747	280726	280726	You	1066	" "
280765	280769	280780	280780	you	1066	" replied Isabella . "
280773	280777	280780	280780	you	1066	" ejaculated Markham : "

280803	280822	280801	280801	Talbot	894	" answered the Italian , casting a glance of sympathy — of tender sympathy — upon her lover . "

281992	282000	281956	281956	you	1066	" said the young lady , tenderly : "

282040	282071	282033	282033	you	1066	" cried the young man , enthusiastically , his handsome countenance irradiated with a glow of animation which set off his proud style of male beauty to its fullest extent ; "
282192	282193	282194	282194	Richard	874	" "
282196	282202	282203	282203	you	874	" answered the Italian lady , "
282417	282418	282421	282421	Isabella	1066	" "
282425	282429	282421	282421	Isabella	1066	" exclaimed Richard , "

282487	282491	282484	282485	dear Richard	874	" said Isabella : "

282539	282543	282532	282532	He	2156	" answered Markham : "
282684	282685	282660	282662	an old woman	28871	" "
282694	282702	282660	282662	an old woman	28871	" said Isabella , with a shudder . "
282740	283033	282734	282734	Providence	878	" Richard pressed his lips to those of that charming girl , and bade her adieu . She tore herself — now reluctantly!—away from him , and hastily retraced her steps towards the mansion . But ere she passed the angle of the grove , she turned and waved her handkerchief to her lover . The young man kissed his hand fondly to the idol of his heart : and in another moment Isabella was out of sight . That one half - hour of bliss , which Richard had thus passed with the Italian lady , was a reward for weeks — months — years of anguish and of sorrow ! DURING the ensuing three months nothing occurred worthy of record , in connexion with any character that has figured upon the stage of our narrative . The month of July arrived : and found Tomlinson , the banker , more deeply involved in difficulties than ever . The result was that the consultations between him and old Michael , the cashier , were of very frequent occurrence ; and the latter grew more morose , more dirty , and more addicted to snuff in proportion as the affairs of the bank became the more desperate . One morning , in the first week of July , Tomlinson arrived at the banking - house half an hour earlier than usual . He had taken home the cash - books with him on the preceding evening , for the purpose of ascertaining his true position ; and he brought them back again in the morning before any of the clerks had arrived , with the exception of old Michael Martin , who was already waiting for him when he entered the parlour . "
283042	283061	283036	283036	Michael	1105	" said Tomlinson , on whose countenance the marks of care and anxiety were now too visibly traced , "
283090	283091	283084	283084	he	903	" "
283095	283113	283115	283115	he	903	" growled Martin , plunging his fore - finger and thumb into his capacious snuff - box : "
283131	283132	283115	283115	he	903	" "
283169	283170	283171	283171	He	903	" "
283186	283190	283181	283184	a good many others	8796	" said Michael ; "
283202	283203	283204	283205	Good God	8797	" "
283212	283226	283229	283229	Michael	1105	" exclaimed Tomlinson , with an expression of blank despair upon his countenance . "
283249	283250	283244	283244	you	1105	" "
283268	283279	283229	283229	Michael	1105	workhouse;"—and the old man took a huge pinch of snuff . "
283284	283288	283229	283229	Michael	1105	" cried Tomlinson ; "
283303	283304	283305	283305	I	0	" "
283310	283396	283305	283305	I	0	though;"—and two tears rolled slowly down the cashier 's cheeks . This was the first time that Tomlinson had ever beheld any outward and visible sign of emotion on the part of his faithful clerk . Tomlinson was not naturally a bad man — at all events , not a bad - hearted man : the cashier had served him with a fidelity rarely equalled ; and that announcement of a workhouse - doom in connexion with the old man touched him to the soul . "
283399	283409	283410	283410	you	1105	" he said , taking the cashier 's hand , "
283469	283516	283441	283441	you	1105	" The old man slowly opened one of the cash - books , pointed to the page at the head of which stood his own name , ran his finger down a column of payments made to himself , and stopping at the total , said , "
283531	283532	283441	283441	you	1105	" "
283539	283543	283544	283544	you	1105	" cried Tomlinson : "
283555	283556	283544	283544	you	1105	" "
283569	283585	283544	283544	you	1105	" said the cashier drily , taking a pinch of snuff at the same time . "
283600	283604	283544	283544	you	1105	" said Tomlinson , "
283612	283613	283544	283544	you	1105	" "
283626	283630	283544	283544	you	1105	" returned Michael . "
283637	283638	283635	283635	yourself	1105	" "
283645	283650	283635	283635	yourself	1105	" cried the banker . "
283665	283666	283660	283660	you	1105	" "
283677	283693	283694	283694	I	0	" almost growled the cashier , though his furrowed cheeks were still moist with tears . "
283737	283738	283733	283733	you	1105	" "
283752	283753	283755	283755	you	1105	" "

283791	283862	283784	283784	he	903	" Mr. Greenwood entered the parlour , and old Michael , taking his cash - books under his arm , withdrew . The member of parliament threw himself into a chair , and observed what a beautiful morning it was . Tomlinson made a movement of impatience , and yet dared not ask the question that trembled upon his tongue , and the answer to which would decide his fate . "
283865	283869	283784	283784	he	903	" continued Greenwood , "
283891	283892	283898	283898	Greenwood	903	" "
283900	283905	283898	283898	Greenwood	903	" cried the banker . "

284114	284119	284111	284111	you	0	" returned Greenwood coolly . "
284124	284129	284111	284111	you	0	" cried the banker . "

284258	284284	284285	284285	I	0	" demanded Tomlinson , with that moroseness which men in his desperate condition are so frequently known to manifest towards intriguers more fortunate than themselves . "
284298	284302	284290	284290	you	0	" answered Greenwood . "
284422	284423	284445	284445	you	0	" "
284428	284432	284445	284445	you	0	" said Tomlinson : "

284448	284452	284445	284445	you	0	" resumed Greenwood : "

284479	284485	284475	284477	my good friend	29199	" cried the despairing man , "

284806	284820	284794	284794	I	0	" said Tomlinson , again rendered rather impatient by Mr. Greenwood 's discursiveness . "
284831	284835	284794	284794	I	0	" continued Greenwood ; "
284921	284922	284945	284945	you	0	" "

285483	285637	285469	285469	you	903	" Tomlinson was pacing the bank - parlour in an abstracted mood , and paid not the slightest attention to this tirade from the lips of the newly - fledged politician . Mr. Greenwood saw that his observations were unheeded , and accordingly rose to take his departure . Tomlinson gave him a bill for a thousand pounds to enable him to strike a docket against him ; and Mr. Greenwood then withdrew . The moment he was gone , old Michael entered the room ; and Tomlinson communicated to him all that had passed . The cashier made no reply , but took the largest pinch of snuff he had ever yet abstracted from his box or conveyed to his nose . He had not yet broken silence , when the door opened , and Mr. Greenwood returned . Michael was about to withdraw ; but the capitalist stopped him , saying , "
285664	285665	285469	285469	you	903	" "
285669	285673	285469	285469	you	903	" exclaimed Tomlinson : "

286013	286032	286009	286009	you	1105	" The old cashier answered only with a grunt , and took snuff as it were by handfuls . "
286039	286045	286035	286035	you	1105	" repeated Tomlinson , impatiently . "
286064	286070	286046	286046	I	0	" replied the old man . "

286271	286301	286312	286312	you	1005	child;"—and the cashier wrung the hand of the member of Parliament with a warmth indicative of an amount of feeling which he had never been known to demonstrate before . "
286317	286344	286312	286312	you	1005	" said Greenwood ; and with these words he departed . And as he drove back to the West - End , he said to himself , "
286413	286431	286403	286403	his	1005	" The moment Greenwood had left the bank - parlour , old Michael accosted Tomlinson , and said "

286546	286575	286541	286541	you	1005	" cried Tomlinson , always bewildered by the terrors of his situation , and still half shrinking from the daring plot which Greenwood had opened to his view ; "
286597	286698	286594	286594	you	1005	" ON the Saturday morning following the Thursday on which the above - mentioned conversation took place , the count and his family were seated at breakfast . The morning paper was late ; and his lordship was one of those persons who can not enjoy their repast without the intellectual association of a journal . At length the wished - for print arrived ; and the count was soon buried in the preceding night 's debate in the House of Commons — for he felt deeply interested in all political affairs , no matter to which country they referred . "
286708	286719	286703	286706	a very clever man	8883	" he observed , after a long interval of silence . "

286890	286899	286886	286886	I	0	" said the count , after a pause , "
286927	286932	286969	286969	you	8891	" he added fervently , "
286995	286996	286969	286969	you	8891	" "
287008	287014	286969	286969	you	8891	" said the countess solemnly . "

287034	287038	286969	286969	you	8891	" exclaimed Isabella , "
287057	287146	286969	286969	you	8891	" The count resumed the perusal of the newspaper ; but his eyes had not dwelt many minutes upon the page ere he uttered a loud exclamation of mingled astonishment and alarm . The ladies looked towards him in a state of the most painful suspense : and this feeling was not immediately removed , for the count , with an ashy pale face , continued to read the article that had caught his eyes , for some moments , ere he explained the cause of his emotion . "
287149	287154	286969	286969	you	8891	" exclaimed the countess , "
287163	287164	287248	287248	Tomlinson	1005	" "
287183	287195	286969	286969	you	8891	" answered the nobleman , throwing the paper upon the table . "
287202	287207	286969	286969	you	8891	" he continued bitterly , "
287224	287225	286969	286969	you	8891	" "
287232	287245	286969	286969	you	8891	" said the countess , a prey to the most acute anxiety . "
287253	287259	287248	287248	Tomlinson	1005	" cried the Italian exile ; "
287267	287268	287269	287269	My	0	" "
287273	287292	287269	287269	My	0	" said Isabella , hastening to fling her arms around the neck of her much - loved sire , "

287307	287328	287269	287269	My	0	" repeated the countess ; and , taking up the newspaper , the following article instantly met her eyes : — "
287337	287583	287584	287584	Our	8899	" The City was yesterday morning thrown into a state of the greatest fermentation by a rumour which prevailed at about eleven o'clock , that the above - mentioned old - established and well - known banking establishment had been plundered to an enormous amount , and had suspended its payments . Unfortunately the rumour was but too true ; and our reporter , upon repairing to Lombard Street , found an immense crowd collected in front of the bank . The doors were closed ; and the following notice was posted up;—'James Tomlinson is under the painful necessity of suspending the affairs of the bank , at least for the present . The flight of the cashier , with money and securities to an amount bordering upon a hundred thousand pounds , is the cause of this unfortunate step . Further particulars will be made known at speedily as possible . ' It is impossible to describe the dismay which was depicted upon the countenances of those amongst the crowd who are sufferers by this calamity ; and many very painful scenes took place . One widow lady who had placed her little all in the concern , and who arrived upon the spot , to draw her half yearly interest , only a few moments after the doors were closed , was taken away in a state of madness . We have since learnt that the unfortunate lady has entirely lost her reason . "
287625	288183	288184	288184	We	8903	" It appears that the cashier , whose name was Michael Martin , is a very old man , and had been for many years in the service of the present and late proprietors of the bank . His presumed integrity , his known experience , and his general conduct , had led to his elevation to the post of head cashier — a situation which he has filled for upwards of ten years , without exciting a suspicion relative to his proceedings . It is , however , supposed that he must have been pursuing a most nefarious course for a considerable length of time , for reasons which we shall state presently . On Thursday evening , Mr. Tomlinson , who , it appears , is the sole proprietor of the establishment , although the business has been all along carried on under its original denomination of Tomlinson & Co. , quitted the bank at five o'clock , as usual , leaving the cashier to see all safe , and close the establishment for the day , according to custom . When Mr. Sanderson , one of the clerks , arrived at the bank at nine o'clock yesterday morning , he was surprised to find that the doors were not yet opened . The other clerks arrived shortly afterwards ; and their surprise at length turned into alarm . Still the integrity of the cashier was not for a moment suspected ; it was , however , imagined that something most have happened to him — an idea that was strengthened by the fact that the cashier occupied a room in the establishment , and there was consequently no reason to account for the doors remaining closed . The char - woman , who waited upon the cashier and swept out the bank , & c. , came up to the door while the clerks were thus deliberating , and stated that she had not been able to obtain admission that morning as usual . It was now determined by Mr. Sanderson to obtain the assistance of a policeman , and force an entrance . This was done ; and egress was obtained by breaking through the windows and shutters ( which close inside ) of the bank parlour . Mr. Sanderson and the constable immediately proceeded to the cashier 's private room , which is on the ground - floor , and in which the iron safe was kept . The bed had not been slept in during the night . Attention was then directed to the safe , where it was found that it was open , and its contents had been abstracted . The front door of the bank was opened , and the clerks admitted . Mr. Tomlinson was then immediately sent for . That gentleman arrived by ten o'clock ; and a farther investigation took place under his directions . The result of this search was a discovery that not only had the specie , notes , and securities disappeared , but even the cash - books , and all the papers that could throw any light upon the financial affairs of the establishment . It is this circumstance which induces a belief that the cashier must have carried on a system of plunder for a considerable length of time . "
288209	288210	288664	288665	the count	26666	" "
288214	288406	288664	288665	the count	26666	" A reward of £ 3000 has been offered for the apprehension of the cashier ; and a description of his person has been forwarded to all the principal seaports . [ For Description see our advertising columns . ] Our reporter learnt last evening that Mr. Tomlinson was more composed , and had even exerted himself to consult with some friends upon the best course to pursue . It , however , appears that so entirely did he confide in his cashier , that he is only able to give a vague and meagre account of the nature of the securities abstracted . They were , however , the bills and bonds of several great foreign and colonial mercantile houses . We regret to hear that Mr. G. M. Greenwood , M.P. , had paid a considerable sum of money into the bank , on Thursday morning . It appears that upwards of fifty thousand pounds in specie and notes ( the numbers of which are now unknown , they having been entered in one of the books taken away ) and forty - four thousand in securities have disappeared . "

288444	288537	288441	288442	Latest Particulars	1202	" In order to institute the fullest and most complete investigation into the affairs of the bank , it was resolved , at a late hour last evening , at a meeting of the principal creditors , Mr. Greenwood in the chair , that a docket should be struck against Mr. Tomlinson . At the same time , it is our duty to observe that this is done with no ill feeling towards that gentleman , who is deserving only of universal sympathy , and , in no way , of blame . "
288538	288552	288554	288555	the count	26666	" The name of that man Greenwood , in connexion with this affair , "
288557	288611	288554	288555	the count	26666	" impresses me with the idea that all is not right . Moreover , how could the cashier have removed a large quantity of specie without attracting attention in a thoroughfare so frequented at all hours as Lombard Street ? There is something wrong at the foundation of this history of the robbery . "
288612	288634	288636	288637	the countess	5273	" Alas ! little does it matter now to us , whether Mr. Tomlinson be a false or an unfortunate man , "
288639	288650	288636	288637	the countess	5273	" there is one thing certain — we are ruined ! "
288651	288662	288664	288665	the count	26666	" Yes — my dearest wife , my beloved daughter , "
288667	288738	288664	288665	the count	26666	" we are in a pitiable situation — in a foreign land ! It is true that I have friends : the Earl of Warrington — Lord Tremordyn , both of whom know our secret , and have faithfully kept it — would gladly assist me ; but I would not — could not apply to them — even though it be to settle the few debts which I owe ! "
288739	288746	288748	288749	the countess	5273	" Still there remains one course , "
288761	288765	288767	288768	the count	26666	" One course ! "
288770	288817	288767	288768	the count	26666	" Ah ! I know full well to what you allude ; but never , never will I sell my rights for gold ! No , my dear wife — my beloved daughter — we must prepare ourselves to meet our misfortunes in a becoming manner . "
288818	288822	288824	288824	Isabella	1066	" Dear father , "
288826	288848	288824	288824	Isabella	1066	" your goodness has conferred upon me an excellent education : surely I might turn to advantage some of those accomplishments — "
288849	288856	288858	288859	the nobleman	3005	" You , my sweetest girl ! "
288881	288905	288906	288906	Isabella	1066	" you — my own darling girl — a lady of your high rank become a governess ! no — never , never ! "
288916	289949	288906	288906	Isabella	1066	" said the countess enthusiastically . And , even in the hour of their misfortune , that exiled — ruined family found inexpressible solace in the sweet balm of each other 's love ! IT was now seven months since Ellen Monroe became the victim of George Greenwood . She bore in her bosom the fruit of that amour ; and until the present time she had managed to conceal her situation from those around her . She now began to perceive the utter impossibility of veiling her disgrace much longer . Her health was failing ; and her father and Markham were constantly urging upon her the necessity of receiving medical advice . This recommendation she invariably combated to the utmost of her power ; and in order to give a colour to her assurance that she suffered only from some trivial physical ailment , she was compelled to affect a flow of good spirits which she was far — very far from experiencing . Markham had frequently questioned her with the most earnest and friendly solicitude relative to the causes of those intervals of deep depression which it was impossible for her to conceal;—he had implored her to open her mind to him , as a sister might to a brother;—he had suggested to her change of scene , diversion , and other means of restoring her lost spirits;—but to all he advanced she returned evasive replies . Richard and the aged father of the young lady frequently convened together upon the subject , and lost themselves in conjectures relative to the cause of that decaying health and increasing unhappiness for which the sufferer herself would assign no feasible motive . At times Mr. Monroe was inclined to believe that the privations and vicissitudes which his daughter had experienced during the two years previous to their reception at the hospitable dwelling of Richard Markham , had engendered a profound melancholy in a mind that had been so painfully harassed , and had implanted the germs of a subtle malady in a system never constitutionally strong . This belief appeared the more reasonable when the old man called to mind the hours of toil — the wearisome vigils — and the exposure to want , cold , and inclement weather , which had been endured by the poor girl in the court in Golden Lane ; and Markham sometimes yielded to the same impression relative to the causes of a mental and physical decline which every day became more apparent . Then , again , Richard thought that the fresh air of the healthy locality where she now dwelt , and the absence of all care in respect to the wherewithal to sustain life , would have produced a beneficial effect . He enjoined her father to question her whether she cherished some secret affection — some love that had experienced disappointment ; but to this demand she returned a positive negative : and her father assured his young friend that Ellen had had no opportunity of obtaining the affection of another , or of bestowing her own upon any being who now slighted it . Of course her true position was never suspected for a moment ; and thus the cause of Ellen 's unhappiness remained an object of varied and conflicting conjectures . Seven months had now passed since that fatal day when the accursed old hag , whose name we have not allowed to defile these pages , handed her over to the arms of a ruthless libertine;—seven months of mental anguish and physical suffering had nearly flown;—the close of July was at hand;—and as yet Ellen had decided upon no plan to direct her future proceedings . She sometimes thought of returning to Greenwood , and endeavouring to touch his heart;—but then she remembered the way in which they had parted on the occasion of her visit to his house in Spring - Gardens;—she recalled to mind all she knew of the character of the man;—and she was compelled to abandon this idea . She felt that she would sooner die than accept his succour in the capacity of a mistress;—and there were , moreover , moments when she entertained sentiments of profound hatred , and experienced a longing for revenge , against the man who refused to do her justice . Then , again , she recollected that he was the father of the child which she bore in her bosom ; and all her rancorous feelings dissolved in tears . At other times she thought of throwing herself at her father 's feet , and confessing all . But what woman does not shudder at such a step ? Moreover , frail mortals invariably place reliance in the chapter of accidents , and entertain hopes , even in situations where it is impossible for those hopes to be realised . To Richard Markham she would not — dared not breathe a syllable that might lead him to infer her shame;—and yet , where was she to find a friend save in the persons of her father and her benefactor ? Most pitiable was the situation of this poor girl . And yet she already felt a mother 's feeling of love and solicitude for her unborn babe . Often — often , in the still hour of night , when others slept , did she sit up and weep in her chamber:—often — often , while others forgot their cares in the arms of slumber , was she a prey to an agony of mind which seemed to admit of no solace . And then , in those hours of intense wretchedness , would the idea of suicide steal into her mind — that idea which suggests a last resource and a sore relief as a term for misery grown too heavy for mortal endurance . But , oh ! she trembled — she trembled in the presence of that dread thought , which each night assumed a shape more awfully palpable , more fearfully defined to her imagination . She struggled against the idea : she exclaimed , in the bitterness of her agony , "
289955	290377	288906	288906	Isabella	1066	tempter;"—and yet there the tempter stood , more plainly seen , more positive in its allurement than ever ! That poor , helpless girl balanced in her mind whether she should dare human scorn , or in one mad moment resign her soul to Satan ! There was a piece of water at the back of the house close by the main road ; and thither would her footsteps lead her — almost unvoluntarily , for the tempter pushed her onward from behind;—thither would she repair at noon , to contemplate the sleeping waters of the lake within whose depths lurked one pearl more precious in the eyes of the unhappy than the brightest ornaments set in regal diadems,—the pearl of Oblivion ! Thither did the lost one stray : upon the margin of that water did she hover like the ghost of one who had sought repose beneath that silver surface;—and , oh ! how she longed to plunge into the shining water — and dared not . At eve , too , when the sun had set , and every star on the dark vault above was reflected on the bosom of the lake , and the pure argent rays of the lovely moon seemed to fathom its mysterious depths,—then again did she seek the bank ; and as she stood gazing upon the motionless pool , she prepared herself to take the one fatal leap that should terminate her sorrows — and dared not . No — she shrank from suicide ; and yet the time had now come when she most nerve herself to adopt some decided plan ; for a prolonged concealment of her condition was impossible . Markham 's household consisted of Whittingham , Holford , and a female domestic of the name of Marian . This woman was a widow , and had been in the service of our hero only since his release from incarceration . She was between forty and fifty ; and her disposition was kind , easy , and compassionate . One night — about an hour after the inmates of the Place had retired to their chambers — Ellen was sitting , as usual , mournfully in her room , pondering upon her unhappy condition , and dreading to seek a couch where her ideas assumed an aspect which made her brain reel as if with incipient madness,—when she heard a low knock at her door . She hastened to open it ; and Marian instantly entered the room . "
290385	290392	288906	288906	Isabella	1066	" she said in a whisper : "
290396	290405	288906	288906	Isabella	1066	alarmed;"—and she carefully closed the door behind her . "
290413	290416	290438	290438	I	0	" exclaimed Ellen "
290427	290428	290438	290438	I	0	" "
290441	290446	290438	290438	I	0	" replied the servant . "

290565	290576	290577	290577	you	1264	" ejaculated the young lady , sinking into a chair ; "
290589	290605	290584	290584	you	1264	" And Ellen burst into tears . The servant took her hand kindly , and said "
290802	290803	290784	290784	I	0	" "
290816	290832	290811	290811	you	1264	" answered Ellen , to whose ear these words of female sympathy came ineffably sweet ; "

290851	290857	290849	290849	Miss	8932	" interrupted Marian , soothingly , "

291273	291288	291249	291249	you	8918	" ejaculated Ellen , clasping her hands together , while her bosom heaved convulsively . "
291304	291305	291297	291297	me	0	" "
291322	291323	291310	291310	I	0	" "
291339	291346	291325	291326	the person	8954	" said the servant , hesitatingly . "
291356	291376	291325	291326	the person	8954	" cried Ellen ; then , after a pause , she added in a low and almost despairing tone , "
291382	291383	291325	291326	the person	8954	" "
291389	291393	291387	291387	Miss	8959	" continued Marian , "

291454	291458	291447	291447	you	1264	" interrupted Ellen . "
291538	292000	292004	292023	a man who has been a friend to me : I can not hesitate a moment to obey his summons	8963	" The servant then retired ; and Ellen remained alone — alone with the most desolating , heart - breaking reflections . At length her ideas produced a mental agony which was beyond endurance . She rose from her chair , and advanced towards the window , against the cold glass of which she leant her brow — her burning brow , to cool it . The moon shone brightly , and edged the clouds of night with silver . The eyes of the wretched girl wandered over the landscape , the outlines of which were strongly marked beneath the lustre of the moon ; and amongst other objects , she caught sight of the small lake at a little distance . It shone like a pool of quicksilver , and seemed to woo her to its bosom . Upon that lake her eyes rested long and wistfully ; and again the tempter stood behind her , and urged her to seek repose beneath that shining surface . She asked herself for what she had to live ? She did not seek to combat the arguments of the secret tempter ; but she collected into one focus all her sorrows ; and at length the contemplation of that mass of misery strengthened the deep anxiety which she felt to escape from this world for ever . And all the while she kept her eyes fixed upon the lake that seemed sleeping beneath the moonlight which kissed its bosom . But her poor father ! and the babe that she bore in her breast ! Oh ! no — she dared not die ! Her suicide would not comprise one death only;—but it would be the death of a second , and the death of a third,—the death of her father , and the death of her still unborn child ! She turned away from the window , and hastened to seek her couch . But slumber did not visit her eyes . She lay pondering on the best course for her to pursue ; but the more she reflected upon her condition , the farther off did she seem to wander from any settled point . At length she sank into an uneasy sleep ; and her grief pursued her in her dreams . She rose late ; and when she descended to the breakfast - room she learnt that Richard Markham was about to depart immediately for the Continent . Whittingham was busily occupied in packing his master 's baggage in the hall ; and Holford had been despatched into town to order a post - chaise . Markham explained this sudden movement on his part by placing a letter in Ellen 's hand , saying at the same time , "
292025	292039	292014	292014	I	0	" Ellen cast her eyes over the letter and read as follows : — "
292048	292054	292014	292014	I	0	" July 24 , 1839 . "
292060	292120	292121	292122	THOMAS ARMSTRONG	882	" If you can possibly dispose of your time for a few days , come to me at once . A severe accident — which may prove fatal — renders it prudent that I should attend to my worldly affairs ; and to this end I require the assistance of a friend . Such I know you to be . "
292124	292125	292121	292122	THOMAS ARMSTRONG	882	" "
292141	292145	292147	292147	his	26696	" said Markham , "

At length the post - chaise arrived , and Richard departed on his journey , after bidding adieu to Mr. Monroe and Ellen , and having received a special request from the faithful Whittingham "
292271	292328	292261	292261	Kidderminster	119	" IN the evening Ellen retired early to her apartment , for she felt very unwell ; and certain sensations which she had experienced during the day had alarmed her . A short time after she had withdrawn to the seclusion of her own chamber , the faithful and kind - hearted Marian made her appearance . "

293415	293425	293413	293413	Miss	8997	" she added , turning towards the suffering girl , "

293514	293519	293501	293501	he	6950	" demanded Ellen impatiently . "
293572	293573	293556	293556	you	27067	" "
293590	293594	293588	293588	Marian	1264	" said Ellen . "

293617	293621	293604	293605	the surgeon	29781	" observed Marian . "
293627	293633	293623	293623	you	27067	" Ellen shook her head . "
293653	293766	293767	293767	Your	9006	" The servant then hastily extinguished the lights and left the room . She hurried up to her own chamber , took from her box a purse containing forty sovereigns — all her little savings , put on her bonnet and shawl , concealed her face with a thick black veil , and then stole carefully down stairs . All was quiet ; and she left the house by the back door . In three quarters of an hour two persons advanced together up the garden at the back of the house . One was a woman ; and she led a man , whose eyes were blindfolded with a black handkerchief . "
293771	293783	293767	293767	Your	9006	" said Marian — for she was the female alluded to . "
293786	293791	293767	293767	Your	9006	" answered the surgeon . "
293801	293802	293767	293767	Your	9006	" "
293809	293810	293811	293811	You	9006	" "

293857	293861	293855	293855	sir	26649	" answered Marian . "

293980	294281	293967	293968	a gentleman	26980	" Marian let the surgeon onward , and admitted him into the house by the back door . All was still quiet . We have said on a previous occasion that the mansion was a spacious one . Ellen 's apartment was far removed from that in which her father slept ; and the rooms occupied by Whittingham and Holford were on the uppermost storey . There consequently existed little chance of disturbing any one . Marian led the surgeon very cautiously up the staircase to Ellen 's chamber , which they entered as noiselessly as possible . Upon advancing into the room , which was quite dark , the surgeon struck against a chest of drawers , and uttered a slight ejaculation of pain ; but not loud enough to reach the ears of those from whom it was necessary to conceal this nocturnal proceeding . Ellen was in the pangs of maternity when Marian and the surgeon came to her assistance ; and in a few moments after their arrival , she was the mother of a boy . Oh ! who can express her feelings when the gentle cry of the child fell upon her ears — that child from whom she was to part in a few minutes , perhaps for ever ? Half an hour afterwards Marian and the surgeon were again threading the garden;—but this time their steps led them away from the house . Beneath her thick shawl , carefully wrapped up , the servant carried Ellen 's child . She conducted the surgeon to within a short distance of his own abode , placed the child in his arms , and hurried rapidly away . She returned to the Place , and ascended to Ellen 's chamber without disturbing the other inmates . "
294286	294290	294284	294284	Marian	1264	" said Ellen , "
294305	294306	294299	294299	your	1264	" "

294500	294509	294493	294493	Miss	9024	" said the servant , after some hesitation , "

294525	294529	294520	294520	you	0	" exclaimed Ellen . "

294560	294564	294558	294558	Miss	27067	" answered Marian . "

294590	294598	294588	294588	Marian	1264	" said Ellen , with tears in her eyes;—"the

294628	294780	294781	294781	Marian	1264	" In a few moments the young mother was overtaken by a profound sleep — the first she had enjoyed for many , many weeks . But even this slumber was not attended by dreams of unmixed pleasure : the thoughts of her child — her new - born child , entrusted to the care of strangers , and severed from the maternal bosom — followed her in her visions . She awoke , considerably refreshed , at about seven o'clock in the morning . The faithful Marian was still watching by her side , and had prepared her some refreshment , of which Ellen partook . The young mother then asked for writing materials ; and , in spite of the remonstrances of Marian , sate up in her bed , and wrote a letter . When she had sealed and addressed it , she spoke in the following manner : "
294890	294891	294892	294892	You	1264	" "
294918	294919	294910	294910	Your	1264	" "
294946	294957	294958	294959	Mr. Greenwood	903	man;"—and she showed the address upon the letter to Marian . "
294961	294966	294958	294959	Mr. Greenwood	903	" exclaimed the servant . "
294998	294999	294978	294978	he	903	" "
295005	295009	295010	295011	that man	3239	" said Ellen , "

295080	295081	295084	295084	Marian	1264	" "
295107	295115	295116	295116	You	1264	" said Ellen , suddenly checking herself . "

295266	295298	295255	295255	I	0	" NOTHING could be more business - like than the study of Mr. Greenwood . The sofa was heaped up with papers tied round with red tape , and endorsed , some "

Piles of letters lay upon one table ; piles of newspapers upon another ; and a number of Reports of various Committees of the House of Commons , easily recognised by their unwieldy shapes and blue covers , was heaped up on the cheffonier between the windows . The writing - table was also arranged , with a view to effect , in the manner described upon a former occasion ; and in his arm - chair lounged Mr. Greenwood , pleasantly engaged in perusing the daily newspaper which contained the oration that he had delivered in the House on the preceding evening . It was about three o'clock in the afternoon . Mr. Greenwood had risen late , for the House had not separated until half - past two in the morning , and the member for Rottenborough was a man of too decidedly business - habits to leave his post in the middle of a debate . Lafleur entered , and announced Sir Rupert Harborough . "

296259	296283	296255	296257	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" replied the capitalist , who had not failed to notice the emotions of concentrated rage which filled the mind of the baronet . "

296891	296892	296881	296881	you	903	" "
296906	296914	296915	296915	You	903	" replied Greenwood in a determined manner . "
296938	296939	296923	296923	I	0	" "
296945	296973	296943	296943	sir	26649	" said the baronet , scarcely able to repress his rage . Sir Rupert Harborough then withdrew , a prey to feelings more easily imagined than described . "
296991	297003	297004	297004	I	0	" said Greenwood to himself , when he was again alone . "
297070	297082	297083	297084	A female	3827	" Lafleur entered the room at this moment , and said , "
297096	297097	297083	297084	A female	3827	" "
297105	297112	297083	297084	A female	3827	" Lafleur replied in the negative . "
297121	297167	297119	297119	her	3827	" said Greenwood ; and , unaware who she might be , he seated himself at his writing - table , where he appeared to be profoundly occupied with some deeds that were lying before him . In a few moments Marian entered the room . "
297182	297186	297187	297187	I	0	" demanded Greenwood . "
297201	297206	297198	297199	Miss Monroe	1117	" was the reply . "
297211	297236	297208	297209	Miss Monroe	1117	" ejaculated Greenwood ; and he hastened to peruse the letter which the servant placed in his hand . Its contents ran thus : — "
297375	297379	297406	297406	she	1264	" ELLEN MONROE . "
297420	297427	297429	297429	Greenwood	903	" You managed the matter admirably , "
297431	297468	297469	297469	he	903	" There are two points to which Miss Monroe directs my attention in this note . In the first place , she speaks of your most disinterested services . Accept this as a trifling mark of my gratitude:"—and
297484	297494	297496	297500	the kind - hearted woman	9084	" I do not desire any remuneration , sir , "
297502	297521	297496	297500	the kind - hearted woman	9084	" I will take my forty pounds ; but the other two notes I must beg to return . "
297522	297528	297530	297530	Greenwood	903	" No — keep them , "
297532	297542	297544	297545	the servant	2459	" I thank you , sir , most sincerely , "
297548	297582	297544	297545	the servant	2459	" but I would rather not . I rendered Miss Monroe that service which one female should afford another in such a case ; and I can not think of accepting any recompense . "
297596	297605	297607	297607	Greenwood	903	" You are really a most extraordinary woman , "
297627	297646	297607	297607	Greenwood	903	" Will you not permit me to offer you a ring — a watch — or some trinket — "
297647	297652	297654	297654	Marian	1264	" No , sir , "
297664	297690	297654	297654	Marian	1264	" Miss Monroe is so kind — so good — so gentle , I would go to the end of the world to serve her . "
297691	297701	297703	297704	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Well — you must have your own way , "
297706	297741	297703	297704	Mr. Greenwood	903	" The next point in Miss Monroe 's letter is a provision for her child . What sum do you suppose would content the surgeon and his wife who have taken care of it ? "
297742	297764	297607	297607	Greenwood	903	" They are poor people , sir — struggling against difficulties — and having their way to make in the world — "
297765	297777	297779	297779	Greenwood	903	" Suppose we say forty pounds a year for the present , "
297781	297791	297793	297793	Marian	1264	" Oh ! sir — that will be ample ! "
297795	297816	297793	297793	Marian	1264	" and Miss Monroe will be so rejoiced ! Ah ! sir — what consolation to the poor young lady ! "
297817	297826	297828	297828	Greenwood	903	" What is the address of the surgeon ? "
297830	297837	297607	297607	Greenwood	903	" Mr. Wentworth , Lower Holloway , "
297842	297863	297865	297865	Greenwood	903	" My servant shall call upon that gentleman this very evening , and carry him the first quarter 's payment , "
297867	297886	297865	297865	Greenwood	903	" You can say to Miss Monroe — but stay : I will write her a few lines . "
297887	297902	297908	297908	Marian	1264	" Oh ! do , sir . Who knows but it may console her ? "
297917	298007	297910	297911	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Your wishes are attended to in every point . The existence of the child need never be known to either Mr. Monroe or Mr. Richard Markham . Keep faithfully all the secrets which are treasured in your bosom ; and I will never desert the child . I will watch over its welfare from a distance : trust to me . You were wrong to hesitate to apply to me . My purse is at all times at your disposal — so long as those secrets remain undivulged . "
298011	298122	298123	298123	Lafleur	1064	" Marian , prompted by that inherently kind feeling which had influenced her entire conduct towards Ellen , hesitated for a few moments , after receiving this letter , and seemed anxious to speak . She would have pleaded in behalf of the young mother : she would have implored Greenwood to make her his own in the sight of heaven , and acknowledge their child . But her tongue clave to the roof of her mouth;—and she at length retired , unable to give utterance to a single word in favour of poor Ellen . As soon as she was gone , Greenwood rang for his faithful French valet . "
298125	298129	298123	298123	Lafleur	1064	" said he , "
298346	298347	298348	298348	I	0	" "
298353	298357	298348	298348	I	0	" answered Lafleur . "
298362	298363	298348	298348	I	0	" "
298382	298383	298384	298384	You	26649	" "
298392	298397	298390	298390	sir	26649	" And Lafleur retired . "
298404	298416	298417	298417	I	0	" said Greenwood to himself , when he was again alone . "
298454	298529	298560	298560	I	0	" The clock struck six ; and Mr. Greenwood repaired to his dressing - room to arrange his toilet for dinner . THAT same evening Mr. Chichester dined with his friend Sir Rupert Harborough , at the dwelling of the latter in Tavistock Square . Whenever her husband invited this guest , Lady Cecilia invariably made it a rule to accept an invitation elsewhere . The baronet and his friend were therefore alone together . "
298537	298557	298560	298560	I	0	" said Chichester , when the cloth was removed , and the two gentlemen were occupied with their wine . "
298564	298569	298562	298562	you	9097	" exclaimed the baronet . "
298582	298583	298584	298584	He	903	" "
298590	298594	298584	298584	He	903	" said Chichester . "
298599	298604	298595	298597	A conceited humbug	9099	" added the baronet . "
298611	298615	298616	298618	A consummate scoundrel	9101	" remarked Chichester . "
298620	298625	298616	298618	A consummate scoundrel	9101	" cried Sir Rupert . "
298630	298634	298627	298627	he	903	" observed Chichester . "
298644	298649	298627	298627	he	903	" continued the baronet ; "
298667	298668	298658	298659	the deuce	26530	" "
298675	298679	298658	298659	the deuce	26530	" said Chichester ; "

298973	298978	298970	298970	he	903	" said Chichester drily . "

298995	299000	298970	298970	he	903	" observed the baronet . "

299246	299264	299242	299242	you	886	" and Chichester sipped his wine with an affected indifference which was in itself most eloquently significant . "
299269	299278	299242	299242	you	886	" said the baronet , after a pause , "
299341	299342	299313	299313	I	0	" "
299350	299354	299345	299345	you	886	" said Chichester . "

299408	299442	299398	299398	I	0	" Sir Rupert Harborough 's countenance grew deadly pale , and his lips quivered . He now revolted from the mere idea of what he had just before wished to be a fact . "
299462	299470	299448	299448	Greenwood	903	" said Chichester , after a pause . "

299665	299669	299663	299663	Harborough	887	" said Chichester , "

299692	299698	299671	299671	you	887	" interrupted the baronet sharply . "

299851	299937	299840	299840	you	887	" cried Sir Rupert ; and , seizing a candle , he hurried from the room . Twenty minutes elapsed , during which Mr. Chichester sate drinking his wine as comfortably as if he had done a good action , instead of revealing so fearful a secret to his friend . At length Sir Rupert Harborough returned to the dining - room . He was very pale ; and there was something ghastly in his countenance , and sinister in the expression of his eyes . "
299943	299947	299840	299840	you	887	" inquired Chichester . "
299959	299964	299840	299840	you	887	" answered the baronet . "
299971	299982	299966	299966	I	0	" he added , with an hysterical kind of laugh , "

300000	300005	300006	300007	Lady Cecilia	1008	" asked his friend . "

300161	300183	300184	300184	I	0	" cried Sir Rupert , in whose mind one idea was uppermost , in spite of his depraved and selfish disposition : "
300222	300234	300220	300220	God	880	" he added , dashing his clenched fist upon the table ; "
300240	300241	300235	300235	I	0	" "
300255	300259	300235	300235	I	0	" said Chichester . "
300276	300277	300272	300273	the pawnbroker	1903	" "
300280	300294	300295	300295	I	0	" cried the baronet , whose manner continued to be excited and irritable ; "
300299	301007	300295	300295	I	0	" The two friends emptied their glasses , and took their departure , the baronet having carefully secured about his person the booty he had plundered from his wife . They then bent their steps towards the pawnbroking - establishment of Mr. V — — , in the Strand . What a strange type of all the luxury , dissipation , extravagance , profligacy , misery , ruin , and want , which characterise the various classes of society , is a pawnbroker 's shop ! It is the emporium whither go the jewels of the aristocrat , the clothes of the mechanic , the ornaments of the actress , and the necessaries of the poor . Genteel profligacy and pining industry seek , at the same place — the one the means for fresh extravagance , the other the wherewith to purchase food to sustain life . Two broad and direct roads branch off from the pawnbroker 's shop in different directions ; the first leading to the gaming - table , the second to the gin - palace ; and then those paths are carried onwards , past those half - way houses of destruction , and converge to one point , at which they meet at last , and whose name is Ruin . Two working men have been seen standing at the corner of a street , whispering together : at length one has taken off his coat , gone to the pawnbroker 's , come out with the proceeds , and accompanied the other to the nearest gin - shop , where they have remained until all the money raised upon the garment was expended . Again , during the absence from home of the hard - working mechanic , his intemperate wife has collected together their few necessaries , carried them to the pawnbroker 's , and spent the few shillings , thus procured , on gin . The thief , when he has picked a pocket of a watch , finds a ready means of disposing of it at the pawnbroker 's . Hundreds of working - men pledge their Sunday garments regularly every Monday morning , and redeem them again on Saturday night . Are pawnbrokers ' shops a necessary evil ? To some extent they are . They afford assistance to those whom some pressing urgence suddenly overtakes , or who are temporarily out of work . But are not the facilities which they thus present to all classes liable to an abuse more than commensurate with this occasional advantage ? Decidedly . They supply a ready means for drink to those who would hesitate before they sold their little property out - and - out ; for every one who pawns , under such circumstances , entertains the hope and intention of redeeming the articles again . The enormous interest charged by pawnbrokers crushes and effectually ruins the poor . We will suppose that a mechanic pledges his best clothes every Monday morning , and redeems them every Saturday night for wear on the Sabbath : we will presume that the pawnbroker lends him one pound each time:—they will thus be in pawn 313 days in each year , for which year he will pay 3s . 8d . interest , and 4s . 4d . for duplicates — making a total of 8s . Thus he pays 8s . for the use of his own clothes for 52 days ! If the government were really a paternal one — if it had the welfare of the industrious community at heart , it would take the system of lending money upon deposits under its own supervision , and establish institutions similar to the Mont de Piété in France . Correctly managed , demanding a small interest upon loans , such institutions would become a blessing:—now the shops of pawnbrokers are an evil and a curse ! Sir Rupert Harborough entered the pawnbroker 's shop by the front door , while Mr. Chichester awaited him in the Lowther Arcade . The baronet was well known in that establishment ; and he accordingly entered into a friendly and familiar chat with one of the young men behind the counter . "
301015	301028	301031	301031	sir	26649	" said Sir Rupert , pointing to one suspended to the wall . "
301070	301071	301044	301068	a young nobleman who had received it along with fifty pounds in cash the same morning by way of discount for a thousand pound bill	9141	" "
301080	301081	301075	301075	you	26649	" "
301085	301092	301075	301075	you	26649	" answered the young man coolly . "
301102	301114	301075	301075	you	26649	" continued the pawnbroker 's assistant , turning towards another painting . "
301130	301131	301075	301075	you	26649	" "
301144	301145	301136	301136	you	26649	" "
301151	301157	301136	301136	you	26649	" whispered the young man . "
301191	301192	301170	301189	an upholsterer who was once immensely rich , but who was ruined by giving credit to the Duke of York	9142	" "

301277	301283	301272	301272	they	9149	" said the baronet carelessly . "

301306	301311	301326	301326	my	0	" exclaimed the assistant . "
301329	301334	301326	301326	my	0	" said Sir Rupert . "
301347	301538	301326	301326	my	0	" added the assistant ; and , having made out the duplicates , he handed Sir Rupert over the sum required . On the following morning the baronet paid Mr. Greenwood the six hundred pounds , and gave a new bill for a thousand at four months , for which the capitalist was generous enough not to charge him any interest . There was nothing in the baronet 's conduct to create a suspicion in Mr. Greenwood 's mind that his intrigue with Lady Cecilia was detected ; but when the transaction was completed , Sir Rupert hastened to consult with his friend Chichester upon some plan for obtaining positive evidence of that amour . AT the expiration of ten days from the mysterious accouchement of Ellen Monroe , Richard Markham returned home . It was late at night when he alighted at his dwelling ; but , as he had written two days previously to say when his arrival might be expected , Mr. Monroe and Whittingham were sitting up to receive him . Richard 's countenance was mournful ; and he wore a black crape round his hat . "
301548	301553	301546	301546	Richard	874	" said Mr. Monroe . "
301579	301580	301569	301569	you	9151	" "
301591	301595	301581	301581	I	0	" said Richard . "
301626	301627	301628	301628	I	0	" "
301642	301646	301638	301638	his	994	" answered Whittingham ; "
301662	301663	301653	301653	he	994	" "
301670	301679	301666	301668	an excellent man	9156	" observed Markham , wiping away a tear . "
301694	301700	301701	301701	I	0	" added Whittingham , dogmatically . "
301711	301719	301701	301701	I	0	" continued Richard , after a pause . "
302119	302120	302121	302123	Poor Master Richard	1212	" "
302125	302137	302138	302138	I	0	" said Whittingham , surveying the young man with affectionate admiration . "
302148	302152	302141	302141	I	0	" continued Markham : "
302690	302691	302684	302684	His	0	" "
302696	302710	302692	302694	Good old man	9180	" exclaimed Whittingham , applying his snow - white handkerchief to his eyes . "
302717	302721	302692	302694	Good old man	9180	" continued Richard , "
302891	302915	302881	302881	You	9184	" Markham took a paper from his pocket , and handed it to Monroe , who read its contents aloud as follows : — "
302952	302994	302935	302935	you	874	" When you are destitute of all resources — when adversity or a too generous heart shall have deprived you of all means of subsistence — and when your own exertions fail to supply your wants , open the enclosed letter . "
303065	303077	303078	303079	THOMAS ARMSTRONG	882	" These directions I charge you to observe faithfully and solemnly . "
303081	303082	303078	303079	THOMAS ARMSTRONG	882	" "
303087	303091	303078	303079	THOMAS ARMSTRONG	882	" ejaculated Monroe . "
303111	303112	303109	303109	Richard	874	" "
303125	303131	303109	303109	Richard	874	" said the old butler . "
303141	303145	303146	303146	I	0	" observed Richard . "
303196	303197	303191	303191	Ellen	1117	" "
303211	303221	303191	303191	Ellen	1117	" answered Monroe , tears starting to his eyes . "
303227	303231	303232	303232	I	0	" cried Markham . "
303241	303242	303234	303234	you	0	" "
303254	303258	303243	303243	I	0	" said Monroe , "
303340	303341	303342	303342	You	0	" "
303353	303357	303350	303351	Mr. Monroe	885	" exclaimed Markham . "
303375	303376	303367	303367	she	29177	" "
303390	303394	303377	303377	She	29177	" observed Monroe . "
303431	303496	303497	303498	Mr. Markham	874	" Richard pressed the hand of the old man , and retired to his chamber , to seek that repose of which he stood so much in need after his journey . But ere he sought his couch , he sate down and wrote the following note to Count Alteroni , that it might be despatched to Richmond without delay in the morning : — "
303602	303702	303705	303705	Miss	9201	" IN the morning , when Ellen awoke at about eight o'clock , the first news she heard from Marian 's lips was the return of Richard Markham . The first sentiment which this announcement excited in the mind of the young lady , was one of extreme joy and thankfulness that her accouchement should have occurred so prematurely , and thus have happened during his absence ; but this feeling was succeeded by one of vague alarm and undefined dread , lest by some means or other her secret should transpire . This fear she expressed to Marian . "
303711	303717	303705	303705	Miss	9201	" said the faithful attendant . "
303754	303755	303748	303749	Mr. Markham	874	" "
303768	303772	303762	303762	Marian	1264	" returned Ellen ; "
303802	303803	303781	303781	you	874	" "
303853	303854	303855	303855	I	0	" "
303864	303865	303862	303862	Marian	1264	" "
303879	303913	303867	303867	I	0	" When Ellen was alone , she buried her face in the pillow and wept bitterly ; and from time to time her voice , almost choked with sobs , gave utterance to the words—"My
303919	304007	303867	303867	I	0	" Oh ! how happy would she have been , could she have proclaimed herself a mother without shame , and have spoken of her child to her father and her friend without a blush . In a few minutes Marian returned to the room ; and Ellen hastened to assume an air of composure . She wiped away her tears , and sate up in the bed , supported by pillows — for she was yet very weak and sickly — to partake of some refreshment . "
304018	304031	304032	304032	He	874	" said Marian , as she attended upon her lovely young patient . "
304057	304058	304059	304059	I	0	" "
304070	304074	304068	304068	Marian	1264	" exclaimed Ellen . "
304106	304107	304076	304076	you	1264	" "
304132	304308	304114	304114	I	0	" observed Ellen . Marian said all she could to re - assure the young mother ; and when the invalid had partaken of some tea , the kind - hearted servant left her , in order to attend to her own domestic duties down stairs . Ellen than fell into a mournful reverie , during which she reviewed all the events of the last two years and a half of her life . She pondered upon the hideous poverty in which she and her father had been plunged in the court leading out of Golden Lane ; she retrospected upon the strange services she had rendered the statuary , the artist , the sculptor , and the photographer ; she thought of the old hag who had induced her to enter upon that career;—and then she fixed her thoughts upon Greenwood and her child . She was thus mentally occupied when she heard footsteps ascending the staircase ; and immediately afterwards some one knocked at her door . In a faint voice she said , "
304312	304345	304114	304114	I	0	" The door opened , and Richard Markham entered the apartment ; but , as he crossed the threshold , he turned and said to some one who remained upon the landing , "
304355	304373	304374	304374	Ellen	1117	" He then advanced towards the bed , and took the young lady 's thin white hand . "
304376	304380	304374	304374	Ellen	1117	" he exclaimed , "
304387	304388	304394	304394	Richard	874	" "
304396	304406	304394	304394	Richard	874	" returned the invalid , casting down her eyes ; "
304434	304435	304394	304394	Richard	874	" "
304447	304451	304438	304438	you	1117	" said Markham . "
304485	304486	304473	304473	Marian	1264	" "
304507	304508	304497	304497	I	0	" "
304515	304520	304521	304521	he	2203	" interrupted Ellen eagerly ; "
304543	304544	304540	304540	he	2203	" "
304548	304552	304540	304540	he	2203	" ejaculated Markham . "
304562	304563	304553	304553	You	1117	" "
304572	304573	304565	304565	Marian	1264	" "
304606	304607	304608	304608	I	0	" "
304631	304632	304615	304615	Marian	1264	" "
304637	304641	304635	304635	Ellen	1117	" cried Markham , "
304648	304649	304650	304650	You	874	" "
304654	304677	304650	304650	You	874	" exclaimed the young lady , with a cold shudder that seemed to terminate in a death - chill at the heart . "
304680	304693	304650	304650	You	874	" continued Markham , his voice assuming a tone of melancholy interest ; "
304796	304797	304783	304783	God	880	" "
304810	304814	304800	304800	Richard	874	" said Ellen ; "
304835	304836	304807	304807	you	874	" "
304848	304852	304839	304839	Ellen	1117	" returned Markham ; "
304872	304873	304863	304863	myself	0	" "
304876	304882	304863	304863	myself	0	" repeated Ellen , mechanically . "
304896	304909	304887	304889	a medical gentleman	9219	" With these words Richard hastened to the door , and said , "
304929	305033	304922	304922	I	0	" The medical man then entered the chamber ; and Markham immediately retired . The votary of Æsculapius was a man of apparently five - and - twenty years of age — pale , but good - looking , with light hair , and a somewhat melancholy expression of countenance . He was attired in deep black . His manners were soft and pleasing ; but his voice was mournful ; and his utterance slow , precise , and solemn . Approaching the couch , he took the hand of the invalid , and , placing his fingers upon the pulse , said , "
305043	305044	305041	305041	Miss	9221	" "
305073	305094	305097	305097	Miss	9223	" exclaimed Ellen , speaking with a rapidity , and almost an incoherence , which somewhat surprised the medical man . "
305099	305108	305097	305097	Miss	9223	" he said calmly , after a pause , "
305135	305136	305128	305128	you	9223	" "
305157	305158	305149	305149	I	0	" "
305165	305171	305176	305176	sir	26649	" asked the medical man . "
305193	305194	305185	305185	I	0	" "
305200	305229	305197	305197	you	9223	" demanded the surgeon , seating himself by the side of the invalid with the air of a man who is determined to obtain answers to his questions . "
305241	305245	305230	305230	I	0	" said Ellen ; "
305257	305258	305252	305252	I	0	" "
305291	305292	305285	305285	you	9223	" "
305324	305325	305327	305327	me	0	" "
305373	305374	305377	305377	sir	26649	" "
305385	305412	305381	305381	you	26649	" cried Ellen , scarcely knowing what she said , and shrinking beneath the glance of mingled curiosity and surprise which the surgeon cast upon her . "
305422	305428	305381	305381	you	26649	" inquired the medical adviser . "
305457	305458	305471	305471	I	0	" "
305463	305468	305471	305471	I	0	" added the surgeon . "
305494	305495	305471	305471	I	0	" "
305504	305508	305498	305498	sir	26649	" replied Ellen . "
305526	305527	305523	305523	I	0	" "
305543	305544	305529	305529	you	27067	" "
305555	305582	305529	305529	you	27067	" said Ellen fearful of confirming the surgeon 's impression that she had been very ill , and consequently stood greatly in need of professional assistance : "
305593	305594	305529	305529	you	27067	" "
305598	305640	305529	305529	you	27067	" repeated the medical man , as if struck by the coincidence of this statement with something which at that moment occurred to his memory ; then glancing rapidly round the room , he started from his chair , and said , "
305657	305658	305653	305653	you	27067	" "
305663	305676	305653	305653	you	27067	" repeated the unhappy young lady , who trembled for her secret . "
305683	305702	305717	305717	you	26649	" demanded the surgeon , the slow solemnity of his tone changing to a strange rapidity of utterance : "
305711	305712	305717	305717	you	26649	" "
305727	305728	305722	305722	you	26649	" "
305733	305745	305722	305722	you	26649	" continued the surgeon , gazing fixedly upon Ellen 's countenance , "
305755	305756	305757	305757	His	9234	" "
305761	305775	305778	305783	a servant wearing a black veil	9235	" repeated Ellen mechanically , while a fearful shudder passed through her frame . "
305785	305786	305778	305783	a servant wearing a black veil	9235	" "
305791	305792	305778	305783	a servant wearing a black veil	9235	" "
305797	305798	305778	305783	a servant wearing a black veil	9235	" "
305807	305808	305811	305816	a lady of a male child	9238	" "
305818	305819	305811	305816	a lady of a male child	9238	" "
305832	305833	305830	305830	you	26649	" "
305839	305845	305837	305837	myself	0	" cried the surgeon emphatically . "
305854	305879	305837	305837	myself	0	" exclaimed Ellen ; and covering her face with her hands , she burst into an agony of tears and heart - wrung sobs . "
305882	305898	305837	305837	myself	0	" continued the surgeon , pacing the room , and glancing rapidly on all sides : "
305935	305966	305970	305970	sir	26649	" And for some moments he walked up and down the room in profound silence . Suddenly Ellen started up to a sitting posture in the bed , and exclaimed , "
305983	305984	305976	305976	you	26649	" "
305991	305996	305987	305989	Miss — Madam	9244	" replied Mr. Wentworth ; "
306010	306011	305987	305989	Miss — Madam	9244	" "
306025	306029	306018	306018	you	26649	" said Ellen . "
306050	306051	306032	306032	sir	26649	" "
306055	306065	306018	306018	you	26649	" said the surgeon , in a compassionate tone ; "
306073	306074	306066	306066	you	9250	" "
306090	306099	306066	306066	you	9250	" cried Ellen , clasping her hands together . "
306122	306146	306147	306148	Miss Monroe	1117	" Mr. Wentworth appeared to reflect deeply for some moments . Ellen awaited his reply in a state of the most agonising suspense . "
306150	306166	306147	306148	Miss Monroe	1117	" at length said Mr. Wentworth , speaking in his usual solemn and grave tone , "
306193	306194	306195	306195	I	0	" "
306206	306211	306213	306213	you	26649	" answered Ellen emphatically . "
306260	306261	306252	306252	I	0	" "
306276	306277	306268	306268	Your	1117	" "
306292	306296	306290	306290	you	26649	" exclaimed Ellen . "
306332	306333	306336	306337	Miss Monroe	1117	" "
306363	306364	306355	306355	I	0	" "
306371	306388	306355	306355	I	0	" said Ellen pressing the surgeon 's hand with the warmth of the most fervent gratitude . "
306401	306406	306391	306391	you	1117	" observed Mr. Wentworth ; "
306424	306425	306408	306408	you	1117	" "
306442	306443	306438	306438	you	26649	" "
306457	306462	306463	306464	Mrs. Wentworth	1213	" continued the surgeon . "
306506	306639	306640	306640	Montoni	136	" Ellen once more expressed her sincere and heartfelt thanks to the surgeon , who shortly took his leave of her , after strictly recommending her to take the medicaments which he should send in the course of the day . And now the recovery of the young invalid progressed rapidly ; and her own mind , relieved of many sources of anxiety and alarm , aided nature in conducting her to convalescence ; for she longed to behold and caress her child ! A FEW days after the incidents just narrated , the following letters were opened in the Black Chamber of the General Post - Office . The first was from the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Castelcicala to the representative of that state at the British court : — "
306644	306896	306640	306640	Montoni	136	" The undersigned is desired by his lordship the Marquis of Gerrano , Minister of Foreign Affairs , to inform your excellency that the information you forwarded relative to the Englishwoman Eliza Sydney , has failed to produce the desired effect . Your excellency stated that Mrs. Arlington , the correspondent of the said Eliza Sydney , was the mistress of the Earl of Warrington ; and that Eliza Sydney herself had been confined for two years in a criminal prison in England . Your excellency moreover forwarded the English newspapers of the time , containing a full and detailed report of her crime and trial . These statements have failed to produce any effect in a certain quarter , in consequence of the infatuation of a high personage in respect to this Eliza Sydney , and the apparent frankness ( as the Marquis of Gerrano has learnt ) with which she avowed the entire history of her past life to the high personage alluded to . It is now of the greatest consequence that your excellency should ascertain whether Eliza Sydney 's conduct has ever been tainted with incontinence ; whether , in a word , she has not indulged in immoral and vicious courses . The result of your excellency 's inquiries must be forwarded by courier without delay ; as you will perceive , by the inclosed copy of a ducal ordinance issued this morning , that the infatuation above alluded to grows to a very dangerous point . "
307012	307025	307026	307027	BARON RUPERTO	1004	" The undersigned renews his expressions of perfect consideration toward your excellency . "
307029	307038	307026	307027	BARON RUPERTO	1004	" Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs . "
307044	307065	307066	307067	ANGELO III	1189	" The following is a copy of the ducal ordinance to which reference was made in the above letter : — "
307081	307091	307092	307092	We	9275	" To all present and to come , Greeting : "
307103	307121	307186	307188	the Grand Duke	29429	" I. The style and title of Marchioness of Ziani are conferred upon the Signora Eliza Sydney . "
307144	307184	307186	307188	the Grand Duke	29429	" III . Our Minister Secretary of State for the Department of the Interior will execute the first article of this ordinance ; and our Minister Secretary of State for the Department of Finance will execute the second article . "

307439	307496	307511	307511	his	28357	" In my last letter I informed you that some one had represented to the Grand Duke my misfortunes in England . Happily this announcement failed to produce any change in his conduct or views with regard to me , as I had previously made him acquainted with all those particulars , of my own accord . "
307624	307717	307718	307718	I	0	" Well , then — all is decided : I am to be Grand Duchess of Castelcicala . The marriage is to take place in six weeks from the present date . The daughters of General Grachia are to be my bridesmaids . As a preliminary step towards this high honour , the Grand Duke has conferred upon me a title and a pension . To the world I am now the Marchioness of Ziani : to you , Diana , I am still , and always shall be — Eliza Sydney . "
307859	307907	307908	307908	You	9295	" I need scarcely say that you will oblige me by tendering my best thanks to the Earl of Warrington for the kind advice he sent me through you , and renew to him the expression of my eternal gratitude for all he has done for me . "
307918	307922	307954	307954	Montoni	136	" ELIZA SYDNEY . "
307928	307953	307954	307954	Montoni	136	" The third letter read upon this occasion , was addressed to Count Alteroni , Richmond , and ran in the following manner : — "

308492	308501	308503	308504	the Examiner	3957	" You have taken copies of these letters ? "
308506	308511	308513	308514	the clerk	2971	" Yes , sir , "
308518	308544	308513	308514	the clerk	2971	" Then let them be immediately conveyed to the office of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , as their contents are highly important . "
308545	308550	308479	308479	I	0	" Yes , sir . "
308754	308761	308764	308765	the crowd	29113	" Here 's the trade assignee , "
308870	308886	308888	308889	Mr. Styles	1220	" Fine day , Mr. Styles . How are Mrs. Styles and those dear children ? "
308893	308920	308888	308889	Mr. Styles	1220	batchelor.)—"Ah ! Mr. Milksop , how are you ? quite delighted to see you ! Why , upon my word , you are getting quite stout . "
308933	308978	308888	308889	Mr. Styles	1220	" But every thing prospers with you , I suppose!—Well , Mr. Chivers , how do you do ? Any thing new on the Stock - Exchange ? I believe you do n't suffer much by this business of Tomlinson 's , do you ? "
308979	308988	308990	308991	Mr. Chivers	1223	" Only three thousand — that 's all ! "
309004	309011	309013	309013	Greenwood	903	" Oh ! a mere song ! "
309020	309070	309017	309017	his	903	" Well , Vokes , are you here ? you do n't mean to say that you 're wasting your time in this manner , eh?—Ah ! Tullett , my good friend — delighted to see you . Why , how well you do look , to be sure ! "
309082	309088	309017	309017	his	903	" grinned horribly a ghastly smile "
309127	309133	309135	309139	the clerk of the court	9357	" Where 's the bankrupt ? "
309162	309165	309167	309167	Tomlinson	1005	" Here , "
309358	309363	309365	309366	a creditor	3560	" Very unfortunate indeed , "
309368	309390	309392	309392	another	26953	" I would much rather have heard that there was a dividend , than that the accounts are so very satisfactory , "
309394	309408	309410	309411	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Mr. Tomlinson 's creditors can not complain of him , your Honour , "
309416	309439	309410	309411	Mr. Greenwood	903	" on the contrary , they have every reason to be perfectly satisfied with him . He has given up every thing — "
309440	309451	309453	309454	Mr. Vokes	1224	" Why , there was nothing left to give up ! "
309456	309463	309465	309466	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Nothing left to give up ! "
309477	309559	309465	309466	Mr. Greenwood	903	" permit me , sir , as the trade - assignee duly chosen at the last meeting — permit me , sir , to inform you that there were the desks , counters , stools , and various fixtures of the bank — all of which Mr. Tomlinson surrendered in the most honourable and straightforward manner , and which have realized a hundred and eighty - one pounds , seventeen shillings , and sixpence , for the benefit of the estate . "
309560	309571	309573	309574	Mr. Vokes	1224	" Well — and what has become of that sum ? "
309576	309585	309587	309588	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Consumed by the expenses of the fiat , "
309591	309625	309587	309588	Mr. Greenwood	903	" But , as I was observing , your Honour , when I was interrupted — interrupted in a most indecent manner — the position of Mr. Tomlinson is a most honourable one — "
309626	309633	309635	309637	the consumptive creditor	9372	" Perhaps it is even enviable , "
309641	309647	309649	309650	Mr. Greenwood	903	" And I for one , "
309652	309659	309649	309650	Mr. Greenwood	903	" shall certainly sign his certificate . "
309660	309672	309674	309675	the Commissioner	8840	" Have no tidings been heard of the cashier who absconded ? "
309677	309682	309684	309686	the official assignee	9343	" None , sir , "
309692	309706	309708	309709	a creditor	3560	" What has become of the bankrupt 's furniture at his private residence ? "
309711	309728	309730	309730	Greenwood	903	" His landlord issued a distress for a year 's rent the moment the bank stopped , "
309732	309785	309730	309730	Greenwood	903	" The amount due to this most hard - hearted and unfeeling landlord is a hundred and twenty pounds , and the furniture would not fetch more at an auction . I therefore , with the full concurrence of the official assignee , allowed that very harsh man to keep the goods . "
309806	309826	309786	309787	A barrister	27338	" You allege that about ninety - four thousand pounds were abstracted from the bank by the fugitive cashier ? "
309827	309839	309730	309730	Greenwood	903	" I do — or as nearly as I can guess . "
309840	309871	309730	309730	Greenwood	903	" And yet , by this balance - sheet , I perceive that your liabilities are two hundred thousand pounds . Were you not insolvent when the robbery was perpetrated ? "
309872	309880	309786	309787	A barrister	27338	" It would appear so , certainly . "
309881	309892	309730	309730	Greenwood	903	" Then how do you account for that immense deficiency ? "
309893	309943	309730	309730	Greenwood	903	" I can account for it in no other manner than by presuming that my cashier had carried on a systematic mode of plunder for some years past ; but as I placed implicit reliance on him , I was never led to an investigation of my actual position . "
309944	309960	309786	309787	A barrister	27338	" Do you mean to say that your cashier embezzled many thousand pounds every year ? "
309961	309971	309972	309973	The barrister	4397	" I am afraid that such was the fact . "
310173	310264	310170	310170	he	903	" My dear fellow , you will soon be a new man . In one - and - twenty days this document will have passed the Lord Chancellor and the Court of Review , and be duly registered in Basinghall Street . I will then lend you a thousand pounds , at only twenty per cent . , to start you as a stock - broker . You see how well I have managed your business . You have passed through the Court — and you have kept your furniture . "
310265	310281	310283	310283	Tomlinson	1005	" Which I would have given up to my creditors , had you permitted me , "
310286	310320	310283	310283	Tomlinson	1005	" Nonsense , my dear fellow ! Never give away what you can keep by a little manœuvring . Your landlord can now withdraw his friendly seizure , and all will be well . "
310321	310347	310349	310349	Tomlinson	1005	" Nothing will render me happy until I find out that poor old man who has so nobly , so generously sacrificed himself for me , "
310357	310365	310349	310349	Tomlinson	1005	" What can have become of him ? "
310366	310376	310378	310378	Greenwood	903	" Oh ! do not bother yourself about him , "
310381	310399	310378	310378	Greenwood	903	" He will turn up one of these days ; and then you can remunerate him handsomely . "
310400	310415	310417	310417	Tomlinson	1005	" Ah ! that would indeed be a moment of supreme happiness for me ! "
310419	310422	310424	310424	Greenwood	903	" Yes , "
310428	310444	310424	310424	Greenwood	903	" a five - pound note will recompense the old fellow well for his conduct . "
310445	310452	310454	310454	Tomlinson	1005	" A five - pound note ! "
310456	310465	310454	310454	Tomlinson	1005	" Can you be in earnest , Greenwood ? "
310466	310484	310486	310486	Greenwood	903	" Well , if you think it is too much , give him a couple of sovereigns , "
310490	310547	310486	310486	Greenwood	903	" But I must take leave of you now : I am compelled to devote a couple of hours this evening to the interests of that free and enlightened body whom I have the honour to represent in parliament . So , adieu , Tomlinson ; and when your certificate is registered , come to me . "
310560	310565	310567	310567	Tomlinson	1005	" The heartless villain ! "
310588	310602	310585	310585	he	1005	" and yet his ingenuity has saved me from eternal degradation and shame ! "
310679	310688	310689	310689	he	1047	" My dear wife — my beloved daughter , "
310706	310811	310689	310689	he	1047	" my worst fears are confirmed . The bank will not pay one sixpence of dividend : Greenwood has contrived to get his fellow - conspirator clear of the tribunal ; and the creditors have not a hope left . It was with the greatest difficulty that I could so far master my feelings as to avoid an interference in those most iniquitous proceedings . But my position — my rank forbade me from attempting aught to expose those villains . And now , my dear wife — now , my charming Isabella — prepare yourselves to hear the worst . We are ruined ! "
310812	310815	310818	310819	the countess	5273	" Ruined ! "
310828	310833	310835	310835	Isabella	1066	" Oh ! no , "
310837	310847	310835	310835	Isabella	1066	" we have many friends , my dear father . "
310848	310856	310858	310859	the count	26666	" To whom I will not apply , "
310863	310905	310858	310859	the count	26666	" No — we must wrestle with our evil fortunes , and trust to the advent of better times . At present every thing seems to conspire to crush us ; and should that contemplated marriage take place in Castelcicala — — "
310906	310911	310913	310914	the countess	5273	" My dearest husband , "
310916	310948	310913	310914	the countess	5273	" do not aggravate present griefs by the apprehension of that which as yet only menace us . It is scarcely possible that the Grand Duke will perpetrate such a folly . "
310949	310966	310968	310969	the count	26666	" And that title of Marchioness of Ziani — and that pension,—do they not speak volumes ? "
310972	311009	310968	310969	the count	26666	" Oh ! there are moments when I feel inclined to listen to the representations of those faithful friends in my own country with whom I correspond , and who are ever counselling me to — — "
311010	311017	311019	311019	Isabella	1066	" Ah ! my dearest father , "
311025	311093	311019	311019	Isabella	1066	" would you endanger that life which is so precious to my mother and myself ? would you plunge your native land in the horrors of a civil war ? Oh ! let us dare all our present ills with firmness and resolution ; and if there be a guardian Providence — as I devoutly believe — he will not allow us to be persecuted for ever ! "
311094	311098	311100	311101	the count	26666	" Noble girl ! "
311103	311108	311109	311109	he	26666	" you teach me my duty;"—and
311121	311124	311126	311127	the countess	5273	" Yes , "
311136	311170	311126	311127	the countess	5273	" we are crushed only for a time . Our course is now clear:—we must give up our present establishment ; and — as we have , thank God ! no debts — — "
311171	311185	311187	311188	the count	26666	" Ah ! it is that which cuts me to the very soul ! "
311190	311286	311187	311188	the count	26666	" You are not yet acquainted with the extent of our misfortunes . A brave fellow countryman of mine , who supported me in all the plans which I endeavoured to carry out for the welfare of the Castelcicalans , and who was driven into exile on my account , was imprisoned in London a few months ago for a considerable sum of money . I could not leave him to perish in a gaol . I became answerable for him — and the creditor is now pressing me for the payment of the debt . "
311287	311297	311299	311300	the countess	5273	" And what is the amount of this liability ? "
311304	311309	311187	311188	the count	26666	" Eighteen hundred pounds , "
311314	311327	311329	311329	Isabella	1066	" Do not suffer that to annoy you , my dearest father , "
311331	311341	311329	311329	Isabella	1066	" My jewellery and superfluous wardrobe will produce — — "
311342	311349	311351	311352	the count	26666	" Alas ! my dearest child , "
311354	311419	311351	311352	the count	26666	" all that we possess would not realize any thing like that sum . But , happen what will , our first step must be to give up this furnished mansion , and retire to a more humble dwelling . That will not cost us many pangs . We shall still be together ; and our love for each other constitutes our greatest happiness . "
311420	311427	311429	311430	the countess	5273	" Yes , my dearest husband , "
311432	311441	311429	311430	the countess	5273	" even a prison should not separate us . "
311442	311459	311461	311461	Isabella	1066	" Where my beloved father is — where my parents are — there am I happy , "
311496	311498	311489	311491	that noble Italian	9414	" husband "
311500	311503	311489	311491	that noble Italian	9414	" father , "
311686	311697	311699	311700	the count	26666	" Yes , my beloved wife — my darling daughter , "
311702	311802	311699	311700	the count	26666	" we are ruined by my mad confidence in that villain Greenwood . You know that there is one means by which I could obtain wealth and release us from this cruel embarrassment . But never would either of you wish to see me sell my claims and resign my patriotism for gold ! No — dearest partakers of my sad destinies , that may not be ! I shall ever reject the offers of my persecutors with scorn ; and until fortune may choose to smile upon us , we must learn to support her frowns with resignation . "
311803	311822	311824	311824	Isabella	1066	" That same Almighty power which afflicts and chastises , can also restore gladness , and multiply blessings , "
311940	311973	311974	311974	Isabella	1066	" Read me from your Album , my dear girl , those lines which a poet is supposed to address to his wife , and which always possess new charms for me . "
312024	312047	312012	312013	a servant	5570	" who had some pressing business to communicate , and who was very sure that he should n't be considered an intruder . "
312083	312094	312096	312097	Mr. Johnson	1227	" I b'lieve you 're Count Alteroni , air you ? "
312102	312113	312096	312097	Mr. Johnson	1227	" I am . What is your business with me ? "
312114	312129	312173	312174	the man	2092	" I 'm come from Rolfe , the attorney , in Clements ' Inn , "
312134	312137	312173	312174	the man	2092	" he — "
312138	312159	312161	312162	the count	26666	" Oh ! I suppose he has sent you to say that he will accord me the delay I require ? "
312164	312171	312173	312174	the man	2092	" Not quite that there neither , "
312200	312228	312197	312197	he	2092	" The fact is , I 've got a execution agin your person — a ca - sa , you know , for eighteen hundred and costs . "
312229	312236	312238	312239	the count	26666	" A writ — a warrant ! "
312242	312259	312238	312239	the count	26666	" You do not mean to say that you are come to take me to prison ? "
312260	312266	312268	312269	Mr. Johnson	1227	" Not exactly that either , "
312271	312316	312268	312269	Mr. Johnson	1227	" You need n't go to quod , you know . You can come to our lock - up in the New - Cut , Lambeth , where you 'll be as snug as if you was in your own house , barring liberty . "
312317	312322	312324	312325	the count	26666	" I understand you , "
312339	312399	312336	312336	he	26666	" My dears , the evil moment is arrived . This person is a bailiff come to arrest me ; and I must go with him . I implore you not to take this misfortune to heart:—it was sure to happen ; and it might just as well occur to - day as a week or a month hence . "
312400	312408	312410	312411	the countess	5273	" And whither will they take you ? "
312417	312427	312336	312336	he	26666	" Can not we be allowed to accompany you ? "
312428	312443	312445	312446	the bailiff	4725	" You can come , ma'am , and see his lordship to - morrow , "
312448	312500	312445	312446	the bailiff	4725	" and you can stay with him from ten in the morning till nine in the evening — or may - be till half - arter ten as a wery partick'lar faviour — for which you 'll on'y have to pay half a sufferin extray . But there 's my man . "
312594	312620	312622	312622	Isabella	1066	" To - morrow , my dear father — to - morrow , the moment the clock strikes ten , we will be with you , "
312624	312637	312622	312622	Isabella	1066	" Oh ! how miserably will pass the hours until that period ! "
312638	312659	312570	312571	the count	26666	" Will you not now permit me , my dearest husband , to see the Envoy of Castelcicala , and — "
312660	312663	312665	312666	the count	26666	" No , "
312669	312690	312665	312666	the count	26666	" Did we not agree ere now to support with resignation all that fortune might have in store for us ? "
312691	312700	312702	312703	the countess	5273	" Ah ! pardon me — I forgot , "
312705	312722	312702	312703	the countess	5273	" I am overwhelmed with grief . Oh ! what a blow — and for you ! "
312723	312735	312737	312738	the nobleman	3005	" Show yourselves worthy of your high rank and proud name , "
312740	312748	312737	312738	the nobleman	3005	" and all will yet be well . "
312759	312768	312770	312771	the count	26666	" I am now ready to accompany you , "
312773	312779	312781	312782	Mr. Johnson	1227	" So much the better , "
312784	312821	312781	312782	Mr. Johnson	1227	" Me and my man Tim Bunkins come down in a omnibus ; I do n't know which vay you 'd like to go , but I 've heerd say you keeps a wery tidy cabrioily . "
312822	312843	312845	312846	the count	26666	" It would be a monstrous mockery for any one to proceed to a prison in his own luxurious vehicle , "
312849	312867	312845	312846	the count	26666	" As you came , so may you return . I will accompany you in an omnibus . "
313084	313116	313077	313077	He	9477	" Signora ! is it possible ? Do we indeed meet again ? Ah ! it seems to me that it is an age since I saw you , dearest Isabella ! "
313117	313136	313077	313077	He	9477	" And since we last met , Richard , many unfortunate events have happened . My poor father — "
313137	313148	313150	313150	Markham	874	" Your father ! what can have happened to him ? "
313162	313172	313174	313174	Isabella	1066	" He is in the Queen 's Bench Prison , "
313182	313216	313174	313174	Isabella	1066	" In the Queen 's Bench ! And you are going to him now ? Oh ! Isabella , you must tell me how all this happened : I will escort you a little way;"—and
313265	313270	313272	313272	Isabella	1066	" You are aware , "
313274	313288	313272	313272	Isabella	1066	" that my father intrusted a considerable sum of money to Mr. Greenwood . "
313289	313293	313295	313295	Markham	874	" The villain ! "
313298	313344	313295	313295	Markham	874	" I can not explain to you exactly how it was that my father accepted the security of Mr. Tomlinson , the banker , for that amount , as I am not acquainted with matters of business;—but he did so , and released Mr. Greenwood . "
313345	313356	313272	313272	Isabella	1066	" And Tomlinson failed — and your father lost all ! "
313357	313380	313382	313382	Isabella	1066	" Alas ! he did;—and he is now imprisoned for a sum for which he had become answerable to serve a friend , "
313384	313395	313382	313382	Isabella	1066	" How long has the count been in — in — "
313396	313400	313402	313403	the signora	5333	" In prison , "
313406	313439	313402	313403	the signora	5333	" He was arrested ten days ago ; and , by the advice of a solicitor , he removed on the following day from the bailiff 's private house to the Bench . "
313440	313445	313272	313272	Isabella	1066	" And the countess ? "
313446	313498	313272	313272	Isabella	1066	" My mother is very unwell to - day , and could not leave her room ; and I am now on my way to visit my poor father . We have left Richmond altogether ; and my mother and myself occupy lodgings in the Blackfriars Road , near the bridge . "
313499	313508	313510	313510	Richard	874	" Ten days ago this happened , Isabella , "
313513	313525	313510	313510	Richard	874	" and you did not acquaint me with what had occurred ? "
313526	313540	313272	313272	Isabella	1066	" Ah ! Richard — you know well that circumstances forbade me;—or else — "
313541	313550	313272	313272	Isabella	1066	" Or else ? Speak — dearest Isabella . "
313551	313606	313272	313272	Isabella	1066	" Or else I believe you would have given my father the best advice how to proceed . He is too proud to apply to his friends ; and he cannot — he must not remain in prison . His health would sink under the idea of degradation that has taken possession of him . "
313607	313612	313614	313614	Markham	874	" That villain Greenwood ! "
313618	313629	313614	313614	Markham	874	" When will the day of retribution arrive for him ? "
313630	313638	313640	313640	Isabella	1066	" We must now part , Richard , "
313666	313674	313676	313676	Markham	874	" Yes — we must part again , "
313679	313744	313676	313676	Markham	874	" But how happy should I have been had we met this morning under other circumstances ! How I should have blessed the accident that brought me thus early this morning on some business of my own , to this neighbourhood ! Oh ! Isabella , you know not how constantly I think of you — how unceasingly I dwell upon your dear image ! "
313745	313762	313764	313764	Isabella	1066	" And can you suppose , Richard , that I never devote a thought to you ? "
313773	313793	313764	313764	Isabella	1066	" But we must not talk upon such a subject at present . Let us hope for happier times . "
313883	313894	313895	313895	he	874	" Eighteen hundred pounds would procure the count 's liberation , "
313900	313992	313895	313895	he	874	" eighteen hundred pounds , which he does not possess , and which he is too proud to borrow,—eighteen hundred pounds , which would restore him to his family , and make Isabella happy ! My property is worth four thousand pounds:—if I raise two thousand pounds upon it , I shall curtail my income by exactly one half . I shall have one hundred pounds a - year remaining . But my education was good — my acquirements are not contemptible : surely I can turn them to some account ? "
314566	314579	314581	314581	Markham	874	" Will you have the kindness to accompany me in a cab ? "
314583	314604	314581	314581	Markham	874	" You can render me a service in the way in which I am about to dispose of this money . "
314605	314608	314610	314611	Mr. Dyson	1230	" Certainly , "
314613	314619	314610	314611	Mr. Dyson	1230	" Are you going far ? "
314620	314624	314626	314626	Richard	874	" Not very , "
314666	314672	314674	314674	Richard	874	" Now , Mr. Dyson , "
314676	314708	314674	314674	Richard	874	" will you have the kindness to repair to the office of the prison , and inquire the amount of debts for which a certain Count Alteroni is detained in custody ? "
314736	314751	314753	314754	the lawyer	2668	" Count Alteroni is a prisoner for eighteen hundred and twenty - one pounds , "
314756	314772	314774	314774	Richard	874	" Are there any fees or extra expenses beyond the sum specified in that paper ? "
314776	314784	314786	314787	the solicitor	28220	" Yes — merely a few shillings , "
314789	314837	314786	314787	the solicitor	28220	" I wish , then , that every liability of Count Alteroni be settled in such a way that he may quit the prison without being asked for a single shilling . Here is the necessary amount : pay all that is due — and pay liberally . "
314838	314843	314845	314846	the lawyer	2668	" My dear sir , "
314850	314865	314845	314846	the lawyer	2668	" I hope you have well reflected upon what you are about to do . "
314866	314871	314873	314873	Richard	874	" Yes — yes , "
314876	314887	314873	314873	Richard	874	" I have well reflected , I can assure you . "
314888	314905	314786	314787	the solicitor	28220	" Two thousand pounds — or nearly so — is a large sum , Mr. Markham . "
314906	314914	314786	314787	the solicitor	28220	" I have weighed all the consequences . "
314915	314927	314873	314873	Richard	874	" At least , then , you have received ample security — "
314928	314935	314786	314787	the solicitor	28220	" Not a scrap of paper . "
314936	314958	314786	314787	the solicitor	28220	" Had I not better call and see this nobleman , and obtain from him a warrant of attorney or cognovit — "
314959	314968	314970	314970	Markham	874	" So far from doing any such thing , "
314972	315040	314970	314970	Markham	874	" you must take especial care not to mention to a soul the name of the person who has employed you to effect the count 's release — not a syllable must escape your lips on this head ; nor need you acquaint the clerks whom you may see , with your own name . In a word , the affair must be buried in profound mystery . "
315041	315047	315049	315050	Mr. Dyson	1230	" Since you are determined , "
315052	315078	315049	315050	Mr. Dyson	1230	" I will obey your instructions to the very letter . But , once again , excuse me if I request you to reflect whether — "
315079	315106	315107	315108	The solicitor	28220	" My dear sir , I have nothing more to reflect upon ; and you will oblige me by terminating this business as speedily as possible . "
315392	315398	315400	315400	Markham	874	" Is it all settled ? "
315402	315406	315408	315409	the lawyer	2668	" Every thing , "
315411	315421	315408	315409	the lawyer	2668	" And when can the count leave the prison ? "
315422	315426	315428	315428	Dyson	1230	" Almost immediately , "
315557	315561	315563	315564	the count	26666	" Any letters ? "
315575	315580	315582	315583	the countess	5273	" None this morning , "
315585	315606	315582	315583	the countess	5273	" And now , my dear husband , tell me — have you settled any plan to effect your release ? "
315607	315610	315612	315613	the count	26666	" No , "
315615	315643	315612	315613	the count	26666	" I must trust to events . Were Armstrong alive , I should not hesitate to accept a loan from him;—but to none other would I apply . "
315676	315706	315708	315710	the gallant hussar	30101	" My dear count , you do n't mean to say that it is really true , and that you are here on your own account — strike me ! "
315712	315726	315728	315729	Sir Cherry	1051	" The newth wath twue — too twue , you thee , Thmilackth , "
315745	315749	315751	315752	the count	26666	" True indeed ! "
315756	315767	315769	315770	Sir Cherry	1051	" I wonder whether they will let uth out again ? "
315777	315808	315769	315770	Sir Cherry	1051	" But , I declare , they have got wacket - gwoundth here , and no leth than thwee pumpth . What can the pwithonerth want with tho muth water ? "
315809	315817	315819	315820	the captain	5310	" What , indeed — confound me ! "
315822	315847	315819	315820	the captain	5310	" For my part , I always heard that they lived upon beer . But tell me — how much is there against you ? "
315848	315854	315856	315858	Sir Cherry Bounce	1051	" Yeth — how muth ? "
315860	315865	315867	315868	the count	26666	" A mere trifle , "
315871	315886	315867	315868	the count	26666	" I have been cruelly robbed , and my present position is the result . "
315887	315890	315892	315893	the captain	5310	" Well , "
315901	316005	315892	315893	the captain	5310	" we are all here together — and so there is no harm in speaking openly , you know — and Cherry is n't anybody , strike him!—I was thinking that a very satisfactory arrangement might be made . Always strike when the iron 's hot ! I have long entertained a high respect for your family , count : my late uncle , the general , who introduced me and Cherry to you , always spoke in the best possible terms of you , although he never said much about your past life , and even hinted that there was some mystery — "
316006	316018	316020	316021	the count	26666	" To what is all this to lead , Captain Dapper ? "
316026	316043	316020	316021	the count	26666	" Simply that — why do you stand there , laughing like a fool , Cherry ? "
316044	316049	315867	315868	the count	26666	" Me , Thmilackth ? "
316050	316112	315892	315893	the captain	5310	" Yes — you . Well , as I was saying when Cherry interrupted me — I have always entertained the highest possible opinion of your family , count , and especially of the signora ; and if she would accept my hand and heart — why , strike me ! an arrangement could be made in four and twenty hours — "
316113	316117	316119	316120	the count	26666	" Captain Dapper , "
316122	316155	316119	316120	the count	26666	" no more of this . I believe that you would not wantonly insult either my daughter or myself ; but I can not listen to the terms to which you allude . "
316156	316161	315892	315893	the captain	5310	" My dear count — "
316162	316172	316174	316176	the noble Italian	9564	" Silence , sir ! No more of this ! "
316195	316210	316212	316213	that functionary	4633	" Sir , I have the pleasure to inform you that you are discharged , "
316215	316218	316220	316221	the count	26666	" Discharged ! "
316223	316232	316220	316221	the count	26666	" impossible ! How could I be discharged ? "
316250	316284	316236	316236	Isabella	1066	" A stranger has sent his solicitor to pay every thing against you at the gate ; and all the fees and the little donations to us and the criers are paid also . "
316285	316293	316295	316296	the count	26666	" You are bantering me , sirrah ! "
316298	316361	316295	316296	the count	26666	" You are mistaken . The Envoy from my native land , who alone of all my acquaintances is capable of doing an action of this generous nature , and in so delicate a manner , has been absent from London for the last ten days , and is even unaware of my situation . Who then could have paid my debts ? "
316450	316455	316457	316458	the turnkey	28502	" Well , sir , "
316460	316507	316457	316458	the turnkey	28502	" we do n't know who has done this , and it was n't our business to inquire . All I can say is , that the debt is paid , the fees settled , and you may leave the place as soon as you like . "
316508	316516	316518	316519	the count	26666	" Dapper , this is your doing , "
316527	316531	316518	316519	the count	26666	" And yet — "
316532	316550	316457	316458	the turnkey	28502	" No — strike me!—I had nothing to do with it — I wish I had now . "
316782	316870	316776	316776	his	2222	" Well , Master Richard , all this here ruination — and when I make use of the paragraph ruination , I mean to express the common sentence , flooring — has been brought round about by your over generosity , and good disposition towards others . I ca n't a - bear , Master Richard , to see you circumlocuted and circumwented in this manner ; and now all your property has gone to the canine species — or , wulgarly speaking , to the dogs . "
316871	316881	316883	316883	Richard	874	" What is done , is done , Whittingham , "
316885	316897	316883	316883	Richard	874	" nor did I send for you to criticise my conduct . "
316898	316920	316922	316924	the old butler	26551	" Ah ! Master Richard ; do n't go for to scold me — me that saw you bred and born , "
316932	316955	316922	316924	the old butler	26551	" I would n't be an ominous burden to you for all the world ; so I 'll get employment somewhere else — "
316956	316965	316967	316967	Richard	874	" No — no , my faithful friend , "
316976	317021	316967	316967	Richard	874	" I would not allow you to leave me on any account . As long as I have a crust you shall share it . My present object is to acquaint you with the necessity of introducing the most rigid economy into our household . "
317022	317076	316922	316924	the old butler	26551	" Ah ! now I understand you , Master Richard . And talking of this reminds me that a gentleman in the neighbourhood requires a young youth of the nature of Holford ; and so the lad might step quite permiscuous , as the saying is , into a good situation at once . "
317077	317105	316967	316967	Richard	874	" Well , let him seek for another place , Whittingham ; but tell him that he may stay here until he can succeed in finding one . "
318215	318225	318211	318212	the hag	29746	herself—"There is gold yet to be gained by her ! "
318265	318291	318252	318254	the old woman	26813	" My bird of beauty , you have come back to me again ; I have been waiting for your return a long long time . "
318292	318297	318299	318299	Ellen	1117	" Waiting for me ? "
318304	318332	318299	318299	Ellen	1117	" Yes , miss — certainly . I know the world — and I felt convinced that you could not always contrive for yourself , without me . "
318333	318343	318345	318345	Ellen	1117	" I am at a loss to understand you , "
318347	318355	318357	318358	the hag	29746	" Well — well , no matter ! "
318373	318378	318379	318379	she	29746	" At all events , "
318386	318399	318379	318379	she	29746	" you require my services now — else why are you come ? "
318400	318408	318410	318412	the young lady	4262	" Yes — I require your services , "
318414	318431	318379	318379	she	29746	" I want employment — can you tell me of any thing likely to suit me ? "
318432	318437	318439	318440	the hag	29746	" In what way ? "
318633	318642	318644	318645	the harridan	31270	" In what way can I serve you ? "
318653	318669	318671	318671	Ellen	1117	" Alas ! I have scarcely made up my mind how to answer the question , "
318681	318746	318671	318671	Ellen	1117	" I am not actually in want ; but my father and myself are dependent upon the bounty of one who is by no means able to support us in idleness . My father can do nothing ; he is old — infirm , and broken down by affliction . It therefore remains for me to do something to earn at least a trifle . "
318747	318768	318770	318772	the old woman	26813	" A young lady of your beauty can not be at a loss for friends who will treat her nobly , "
318799	318814	318816	318818	the young lady	4262	" Ah ! I know that I am not the ugliest person in existence , "
318824	318830	318831	318831	she	4262	" but I am anxious , "
318842	318892	318831	318831	she	4262	" to live a quiet — an honourable — and a virtuous life . I know there is nothing to be gained by the needle . I dislike the menial and degrading situation of a copy or a model:—are you aware of no other occupation that will suit me ? "
318893	318902	318904	318905	the hag	29746	" Have you any money in your pocket ? "
318914	318924	318926	318926	Ellen	1117	" I have three sovereigns and a few shillings , "
318935	318947	318949	318951	the old woman	26813	" I know of an employment that will suit you well , "
318953	318972	318949	318951	the old woman	26813	" and my price for putting it in your way will be the three sovereigns in your purse . "
318973	318981	318983	318983	Ellen	1117	" Of what nature is the employment ? "
318985	318993	318949	318951	the old woman	26813	" That of patient to a Mesmerist , "
318998	319004	319006	319008	the young lady	4262	" Patient to a mesmerist ! "
319010	319017	319006	319008	the young lady	4262	" I do not understand you . "
319018	319042	319044	319045	the hag	29746	" There is a French gentleman who has lately arrived in London , and who lectures upon Animal Magnetism at the West End , "
319047	319134	319044	319045	the hag	29746	" He has created a powerful sensation ; and all the world are running after him . But he requires patients to operate upon ; and the photographer , with whom he is acquainted , recommended him to apply to me . You will answer his purpose ; and you well know that I have always performed my promises to you hitherto ; so you need not be afraid to pay me my price at once . I will then give you the mesmerist 's card . "
319135	319150	319152	319152	Ellen	1117	" First explain the nature of the services that will be demanded of me , "
319154	319226	319152	319152	Ellen	1117	" You will be placed in a chair , and the magnetiser will pass his hands backwards and forwards in a particular way before your eyes ; you will then have to fall asleep — or pretend to do so , whichever you like ; and the professor will ask you questions , to which you must reply . This is the main business which he will require at your hands . "
319227	319235	319237	319237	Ellen	1117	" But it is a gross deception , "
319239	319262	319264	319266	the old woman	26813	" You may embrace or refuse my offer , just as you choose . If you are so very particular , Miss , "
319269	319292	319264	319266	the old woman	26813	" why do you not obtain the situation of a governess , or go out and give lessons in music and drawing ? "
319293	319321	319152	319152	Ellen	1117	" Because I should be asked for references , which I can not give;—because there would be a perpetual danger of my former occupations transpiring;—and because — — "
319322	319333	319335	319336	the hag	29746	" Because — because you do not fancy that employment , "
319339	319371	319335	319336	the hag	29746	" See now — my dinner is ready — you are wasting my time — I have other business to attend to anon . Do you refuse or accept my offer ? "
319372	319382	319384	319384	Ellen	1117	" What remuneration shall I be enabled to earn ? "
319388	319395	319384	319384	Ellen	1117	" Thirty shillings a - week . "
319396	319407	319335	319336	the hag	29746	" And how long shall I be occupied each day ? "
319408	319432	319445	319445	she	1117	" About two hours at the evening lectures three times a week ; and perhaps an hour every day to study your part . "
319433	319440	319442	319442	Ellen	1117	" Then I accept your offer , "
319560	319570	319571	319571	she	26813	" You see that I have a good connexion , "
319599	319713	319715	319717	the old hag	29758	" all the fashionable young men about town know me , and do not hesitate to engage my services on particular occasions . Then they recommend me , because I give them satisfaction ; and so I always have enough to do to give me bread . I am not idle , my dear child — I am not idle , I can assure you . Day and night I am at the beck and call of my patrons . I help gentlemen to mistresses , and ladies to lovers . But , ah ! the pay is not what it used to be — it is not what it used to be ! "
319724	319869	319870	319872	The old woman	26813	" There is a great competition , even in my profession , miss — a very great competition . The shoemakers , the tailors , the publicans , the butchers , the bakers , all complain of competition;—but they have not half so much right to complain as I have . Now and then I pick up a handsome sum in one way;—and , while I think of it , miss , I may as well mention to you — for who can tell what may happen?—you are young , and beautiful , and warm — and such a thing is almost sure to befall you as well as any other woman . But , as I was saying , miss — I may as well mention to you , that if you should happen — in consequence of a fault — to — — "
319901	319911	319913	319915	the old hag	29758	" Do not alarm yourself , my dear child , "
319926	319992	319913	319915	the old hag	29758	" I did not mean to offend you . I can assure you that many a young lady , of higher birth than yours , and dwelling in the most fashionable quarters of London , has been glad to avail herself of my services . What would often become of the indiscreet miss if it was n't for me ? what , indeed?—what , indeed ? "
319993	320001	320003	320003	Ellen	1117	" Haste and give me the card , "
320015	320028	320003	320003	Ellen	1117	" I am in a hurry — I can wait no longer . "
320029	320037	320039	320041	the old hag	29758	" There it is , my dear , "
320043	320061	320039	320041	the old hag	29758	" I know the situation will suit you . When you require another , come to me . "
320106	320145	320101	320101	herself	29758	" One of my stray sheep come back to me again ! This is as it should be . There is yet much gold to be made by that girl : she can not do long without me ! "
320769	320776	320758	320759	the Professor	34104	" the truths of Mesmerism practically illustrated "
320826	320828	320758	320759	the Professor	34104	" science "
320920	320932	320913	320914	the Professor	34104	" with a view to produce coma , or mesmeric sleep . "
320994	320997	320998	320998	he	34104	" Clairvoyance , "
321001	321104	320998	320998	he	34104	" is the most extraordinary result of Animal Magnetism . It enables the person magnetised to foretel events relating both to themselves and others ; to describe places which they have never visited , and houses the interior of which they have never seen ; to read books opened and held behind their heads ; to delineate the leading points of pictures in a similar position ; to read a letter through its envelope ; to describe the motions or actions of a person in another room , with a wall intervening ; and to narrate events passing in far distant places . "
321174	321182	321184	321185	the Professor	34104	" I shall now question the patient , "
321187	321213	321184	321185	the Professor	34104	" in a manner which will prove the first phenomenon of clairvoyance ; namely , the power of foretelling events relative to themselves and others . "
321230	321250	321214	321214	He	34104	" Can you tell me any thing in reference to future events which are likely to happen to myself ? "
321251	321268	321270	321270	Ellen	1117	" Within a week from this moment you will hear of the death of a relation ! "
321277	321285	321270	321270	Ellen	1117	" Of what sex is that relation ? "
321286	321296	321214	321214	He	34104	" A lady : she is now dangerously ill . "
321297	321303	321214	321214	He	34104	" How old is she ? "
321304	321336	321270	321270	Ellen	1117	" Between sixty and seventy . I can see her lying upon her sick - couch with two doctors by her side . She has just undergone a most painful operation . "
321337	321343	321345	321346	the Professor	34104	" It is perfectly true , "
321351	321380	321345	321346	the Professor	34104	" that I have an aunt of that age ; but I am not aware that she is even ill — much less at the point of death . "
321381	321389	321270	321270	Ellen	1117	" It is wonderful — truly wonderful ! "
321401	321416	321418	321419	the Professor	34104	" Let us now test her in reference to the second phenomenon I mentioned , "
321421	321444	321418	321419	the Professor	34104	" which will show the power of describing places she has never visited , and houses whose interiors she has never seen . "
321445	321455	321457	321458	several guests	9721	" Ah ! that will be curious , indeed , "
321460	321467	321469	321470	the Professor	34104	" Perhaps you , Mr. Wilmot , "
321480	321495	321469	321470	the Professor	34104	" will have the kindness to examine the patient relative to your own abode . "
321496	321499	321501	321502	Mr. Wilmot	1236	" Certainly , "
321512	321521	321509	321509	he	1236	" Will you visit me at my house ? "
321522	321527	321509	321509	he	1236	" With much pleasure , "
321533	321539	321509	321509	he	1236	" Where is it situated ? "
321540	321545	321509	321509	he	1236	" In Park Lane . "
321546	321557	321509	321509	he	1236	" Come in with me . What do you see ? "
321558	321589	321509	321509	he	1236	" A splendid hall , with a marble table between two pillars on one side , and a wide flight of stairs , also of marble , on the other . "
321590	321608	321509	321509	he	1236	" Come with me into the dining room of my house . Now what do you see ? "
321609	321614	321509	321509	he	1236	" Seven large pictures . "
321615	321621	321509	321509	he	1236	" Where are the windows ? "
321622	321633	321509	321509	he	1236	" There are three at the bottom of the room . "
321634	321641	321509	321509	he	1236	" What colour are the curtains ? "
321642	321647	321509	321509	he	1236	" A rich red . "
321648	321663	321509	321509	he	1236	" What is the subject of the large picture facing the fire - place ? "
321664	321670	321509	321509	he	1236	" The battle of Trafalgar . "
321671	321681	321509	321509	he	1236	" How do you know it is that battle ? "
321682	321710	321509	321509	he	1236	" Because I can read on the flag of one of the ships the words , ' England expects that every man will do his duty . ' "
321711	321721	321723	321724	Mr. Wilmot	1236	" I shall not ask her any more questions , "
321733	321750	321751	321751	he	1236	" Every one of her replies is true to the very letter . And I think , "
321760	321796	321751	321751	he	1236	" that you all know me well enough to believe me , when I declare most solemnly that this young person has never , to my knowledge , been in my house in her life . "
321834	321842	321844	321845	the Professor	34104	" We will have another proof yet , "
321847	321860	321844	321845	the Professor	34104	" Perhaps Mr. Parke will have the kindness to question the patient . "
321869	321884	321861	321862	Mr. Parke	1237	" Will you do me the favour to walk with me to my house . "
321885	321892	321894	321894	Ellen	1117	" Thank you , I will , "
321905	321911	321894	321894	Ellen	1117	" Where is my house ? "
321912	321920	321861	321862	Mr. Parke	1237	" In Mortimer Street , Cavendish Square . "
321921	321930	321861	321862	Mr. Parke	1237	" How many windows has it in front ? "
321931	321934	321894	321894	Ellen	1117	" Thirteen . "
321935	321944	321861	321862	Mr. Parke	1237	" Where are the two statues of Napoleon ? "
321945	321950	321861	321862	Mr. Parke	1237	" In the library . "
321951	321961	321894	321894	Ellen	1117	" What else do you see in that room ? "
321962	321973	321861	321862	Mr. Parke	1237	" Immense quantities of books on shelves in glass cases . "
321974	321980	321861	321862	Mr. Parke	1237	" Are there any pictures ? "
321981	321986	321894	321894	Ellen	1117	" Yes — seven . "
321987	321999	321861	321862	Mr. Parke	1237	" What is the subject of the one over the mantelpiece ? "
322000	322016	321861	321862	Mr. Parke	1237	" A beautiful view of London , by moonlight , from one of the bridges . "
322017	322020	322022	322023	Mr. Parke	1237	" Wonderful ! "
322025	322048	322022	322023	Mr. Parke	1237	" All she has said is perfectly correct . It is not necessary to ask her any more questions on this subject . "
322049	322052	322054	322055	the Professor	34104	" Gentlemen , "
322064	322103	322054	322055	the Professor	34104	" I am delighted to perceive that you are satisfied with this mode of illustrating the phenomena of clairvoyance . I will now prove to you that the patient can read a book held open behind her head . "
322189	322194	322186	322186	he	34104	" What is this ? "
322195	322199	322186	322186	he	34104	" A book , "
322205	322209	322186	322186	he	34104	" What book ? "
322210	322216	322186	322186	he	34104	" Milton 's Paradise Lost . "
322217	322226	322186	322186	he	34104	" At what page have I opened it ? "
322227	322236	322186	322186	he	34104	" I can read pages 110 and 111 . "
322237	322243	322186	322186	he	34104	" Read a few lines . "
322259	322264	322266	322267	several voices	9731	" That is sufficient , "
322269	322296	322266	322267	several voices	9731	" Do not fatigue her . We are perfectly satisfied . It is really marvellous . Who will now dare to doubt the phenomena of clairvoyance ? "
322297	322304	322306	322307	the Professor	34104	" Let us take a picture , "
322309	322321	322306	322307	the Professor	34104	" and she will delineate all the leading points in it . "
322339	322344	322345	322345	he	34102	" What is this ? "
322348	322352	322345	322345	he	34102	" A picture . "
322353	322359	322266	322267	several voices	9731	" What is the subject ? "
322360	322415	322345	322345	he	34102	" I do not know the subject ; but I can see two figures in the fore - ground , with a camel . The back - ground has elevated buildings . Oh ! now I can see it plainer : it is a scene in Egypt ; and those buildings are the pyramids . "
322416	322419	322421	322422	Mr. Wilmot	1236	" Extraordinary ! "
322424	322443	322445	322446	Mr. Parke	1237	" And that little hesitation was a proof of the fact that she could really see the picture , "
322448	322453	322455	322456	numerous voices	9734	" Wonderful ! extraordinary ! "
322507	322510	322511	322511	he	34102	" Gentlemen , "
322521	322549	322511	322511	he	34102	" the arrival of this missive affords me an opportunity of proving another phenomenon belonging to clairvoyance . The patient shall read this letter through the envelope . "
322550	322558	322560	322561	a guest	26808	" But if its contents be private ? "
322563	322580	322582	322583	the professor	34104	" Then I am surrounded by gentlemen of honour , who will not publish those contents , "
322617	322622	322600	322601	The mesmerist	34102	" What is this ? "
322623	322627	322628	322628	she	1117	" A letter , "
322631	322638	322628	322628	she	1117	" It is written in French . "
322639	322643	322645	322646	the mesmerist	34102	" Read it , "
322648	322663	322645	322646	the mesmerist	34102	" The writing is obscure , and the lines seem to cross each other . "
322664	322677	322679	322680	the Professor	34104	" That is because the letter is in an envelope and folded , "
322682	322689	322679	322680	the Professor	34104	" But try and read it . "
322709	322712	322690	322690	Ellen	1117	" Paris . "
322798	322803	322804	322805	FELICIE SOLIVEAU	1241	" Your humble servant , "
322807	322808	322804	322805	FELICIE SOLIVEAU	1241	" "
322819	322824	322804	322805	FELICIE SOLIVEAU	1241	" cried the Professor : "
322857	322898	322853	322855	my poor aunt	9752	" The mesmerist tore open the letter , hastily glanced over it , and handed it to the gentleman who stood nearest to him . This individual perused it attentively , and , turning towards the other guests , said , "
322910	323022	322853	322855	my poor aunt	9752	" The enthusiasm of the disciples of mesmerism present was only damped by the grief into which the Professor was now plunged by the conviction of the death of his venerable aunt . They , therefore , briefly returned their best thanks for the highly satisfactory illustrations of the truths of mesmeric phenomena which they had witnessed upon the occasion , and took their leave , their minds filled with the marvels that had been developed to them . The moment the guests and the reporters had taken their departure , the Professor hastened up to Ellen , took her by the hand , and exclaimed in a transport of joy , "
323070	323141	323063	323065	These English blockheads	9760	" Ellen rose from the chair in which she had feigned her mesmeric sleep , and was by no means displeased with the opportunity of stretching her limbs , which were dreadfully cramped through having remained an hour in one unchanged position . The Professor compelled her to drink a glass of wine to refresh her ; and in a few minutes she was perfectly at her ease once more . "
323144	323149	323063	323065	These English blockheads	9760	" repeated the mesmerist ; "
323438	323439	323451	323452	a gentleman	26980	" "
323445	323449	323451	323452	a gentleman	26980	" said Ellen , "
323478	323479	323451	323452	a gentleman	26980	" "
323483	323488	323451	323452	a gentleman	26980	" answered the Professor . "
323496	323497	323451	323452	a gentleman	26980	" "
323558	323559	323560	323560	I	0	" "
323576	323580	323567	323567	I	0	" observed Ellen . "
323596	323601	323567	323567	I	0	" said the Professor . "
323686	323739	323680	323680	I	0	" Ellen received the money tendered her by the mesmerist , and took her departure . Thus successfully terminated her first essay as a patient to a Professor of Animal Magnetism ! THE wonders performed by the Professor of Mesmerism produced an immense sensation . The persons who had been admitted to the "
323743	323838	323680	323680	I	0	" did not fail to proclaim far and wide the particulars of all that they had witnessed ; and , as a tale never loses by repetition , the narrative of those marvels became in a very few days a perfect romance . The reporters of the press , who had attended the exhibition , dressed up a magnificent account of the entire proceedings , for the journals with which they were connected ; and the fame of the Professor , like that of one of the knights of the olden time , was soon "
323850	324047	323680	323680	I	0	" At length a public lecture was given , and attended with the most complete success . Ellen had an excellent memory ; and her part was enacted to admiration . She recollected the most minute particulars detailed to her by the Mesmerist , relative to the interior of the houses of his friends , the contents of letters to be read through envelopes , the subjects of prints , and the lines of poetry or passages of prose in the books to be read when placed behind her . Never was a deception better contrived : the most wary were deluded by it ; and the purse of the Professor was well filled with the gold of his dupes . But all things have an end : and the deceit of the Mesmerist was not an exception to the rule . One evening , a gentleman — a friend of the Professor — was examining Ellen , who of course was in a perfect state of coma , respecting the interior of his library . The patient had gone through the process of questioning uncommonly well , until at length the gentleman said to her , "
324061	324301	323680	323680	I	0	" In the abstract there was nothing ludicrous in this query : but , when associated with the absurdity of the part which Ellen was playing , and entering as a link into the chain of curious ideas that occupied her mind at the moment , it assumed a shape so truly ridiculous that her gravity was completely overcome . She burst into an immoderate fit of laughter : her eyes opened wide — the perfect state of coma vanished in a moment — the clairvoyance was forgotten — the catalepsy disappeared — and the patient became unmesmerised in a moment , in total defiance of all the prescribed rules and regulations of Animal Magnetism ! Laughter is catching . The audience began to titter — then to indulge in a half - suppressed cachinnation;—and at length a chorus of hilarity succeeded the congenial symphony which emanated from the lips of the patient . The Professor was astounded . He was , however , a man of great presence of mind : and he instantaneously pronounced Ellen 's conduct to be a phenomenon in Mesmerism , which was certainly rarely illustrated , but for which he was by no means unprepared . But all his eloquence was useless . The risible inclination which now animated the great majority of his audience , triumphed over the previous prejudice in favour of Mesmerism ; the charm was dissolved — the spell was annihilated—"the
324315	324598	324662	324662	miss	27067	last"—the voice of the Professor had lost its power . No sooner did the hilarity subside a little , when it was renewed again ; and even the friends and most staunch adherents of the Professor looked at each other with suspicion depicted upon their countenances . What reason could not do , was effected by ridicule : Mesmerism , like the heathen mythology , ceased to be a worship . The Professor grew distracted . Confusion ensued ; the audience rose from their seats ; groups were formed ; and the proceedings of the evening were freely discussed by the various different parties into which the company thus split . Ellen took advantage of the confusion to slip out of the room ; and in a few moments she left the house . Her occupation was now once more gone ; and she resolved to pay another visit to the old hag . Accordingly , in a few days she again sought the miserable court in Golden Lane . It was about three o'clock in the afternoon , when the young lady entered the apartment in which the old hag dwelt . The wrinkled wretch was seated at the table , working . She had bought herself a new gown with a portion of the money which she had received from Ellen on the occasion of recommending the latter to the Mesmerist ; and the old woman 's looks were joyful — as joyful as so hideous an expression of countenance would allow them to be — for she thought of being smart once more , even in her old age . Vanity only ceases with the extinction of life itself . "
324604	324612	324613	324613	you	6938	" said the old woman , gaily ; "

324932	324938	324939	324939	They	27722	" cried the old hag . "

324982	324987	324972	324972	We	9794	" said Ellen firmly . "

325058	325069	325043	325043	you	6938	" answered the old hag , in a surly tone . "

325150	325156	325086	325086	I	0	" replied the old woman . "

325180	325185	325163	325163	I	0	" returned the hag . "
325253	325319	325320	325320	I	0	" For some moments Ellen remained lost in thought . The old woman 's offer pleased her : she was vain of her beauty and she contemplated with delight the opportunity thus presented to her of displaying it with brilliant effect . She already dreamt of success , applause , and showers of nosegays ; and her countenance gradually expended into a smile of pleasure . "
325325	325329	325320	325320	I	0	" she said ; "

325370	325388	325336	325336	you	0	" added the old woman , her wrinkled face becoming more wrinkled still with a sardonic grin . "

325439	325443	325426	325426	I	0	" said Ellen . "
325449	325455	325426	325426	I	0	" answered the old woman . "

325476	325547	325469	325469	I	0	" asked Ellen , taking out her purse . When a bailiff makes a seizure in a house , he assures himself with a glance around , whether there be sufficient property to pay at least his expenses;—when a debtor calls upon his creditor to ask for time , the latter surveys the former for a moment , to ascertain by his countenance if he can be trusted;—the wholesale dealer always "
325551	325606	325469	325469	I	0	" as it were , of the petty detailer who applies to him for credit;—and thus was it that the old woman scrutinized with a single look the capacity of Ellen 's purse , so that she might thereby regulate her demand . And all the while she appeared intent only on her work . "
325617	325625	325607	325607	You	9803	" the old woman at length said ; "
325650	325747	325635	325635	you	9803	" This arrangement was immediately complied with , and Ellen took leave of the old hag , with the fervent hope that she should never require her aid any more . On the following day Miss Monroe called upon the manager of the great national theatre where a figurante was required . She was ushered into the presence of the theatrical monarch , who received her with much urbanity and kindness ; and he was evidently pleased with her address , appearance , and manners , as she explained to him the nature of her business . "
325767	325772	325773	325773	You	9803	" said the manager . "
325856	325857	325858	325858	I	0	" "
325870	325874	325858	325858	I	0	" observed Ellen . "
325880	325885	325891	325891	my	0	" inquired the manager . "
325916	325917	325891	325891	my	0	" "
325934	325938	325891	325891	my	0	" answered Ellen . "
325945	325950	325891	325891	my	0	" said the manager . "
326017	326018	326005	326005	you	9803	" "
326028	326029	326030	326030	My	0	" "
326038	326043	326030	326033	My ballet - master	9812	" replied the manager . "
326072	326193	326030	326033	My ballet - master	9812	" Ellen assented to the proposal , and took leave of the manager . They were mutually satisfied with this interview : the manager was pleased with the idea of securing the services of a young lady of great beauty , perfect figure , and exquisite grace;—and , on her side , Ellen was cheered with the prospect of embracing an avocation which , she hoped , would render her independent of the bounty of others . And now her training commenced . In the first place her feet were placed in a groove - box , heel to heel , so that they formed only one straight line , and with the knees turned outwards . This process is called "
326197	326333	326030	326033	My ballet - master	9812	" At first the pain was excruciating — it was a perfect martyrdom ; but the fair student supported it without a murmur ; and in a very few days her feet accustomed themselves , as it were , to fall in dancing parallel to each other . The second lesson in the course of training consisted of resting the right foot on a bar , which Ellen was compelled to hold in a horizontal line with her left hand . Then the left foot was placed upon the bar , which was in this case held up by the right hand . By these means the stiffness of the feet was destroyed , and they were rendered as pliant and elastic as if they had steel springs instead of bones . This process is denominated "
326337	327147	326030	326033	My ballet - master	9812	" Next , the student had to practise walking upon the extreme points of the toes , so that the foot and the leg formed one straight line . Then Ellen had to practise the flings , capers , caprioles , turns , whirls , leaps , balances , borees , and all the various cuts , steps , positions , attitudes , and movements of the dance . During the caprioles the student had to train herself to perform four , six , and even eight steps in the air ; and the fatigue produced by these lessons was at times of the most oppressive nature.[78 ] When Ellen was perfected in these portions of her training , she had to practise the tricks of the stage . At one time the was suspended to lines of wires ; at another she was seated on paste - board clouds ; then she learned to disappear through traps , or to make her exit by a window . Some of these manœuvres were of a very dangerous nature ; indeed , in some , the danseuse actually risked her life — and all her limbs . The awkwardness of an underling in shifting a trap - door at the precise moment would have led her to dash her head against a plank with fearful violence . The art of theatrical dancing is divided into two schools , called Ballonné and Tacqueté . The former is the branch in which Taglioni shines ; the latter is that in which Fanny Ellsler excels . The style of the Ballonné , takes its name from the airiness of the balloon ; it combines lightness with grace , and is principally characterized by a breezy and floating appearance of the figure . The Tacqueté is all vivacity and rapidity , distinguished by sparkling steps and twinkling measures , executed with wonderful quickness upon the point of the feet . In both these schools was Ellen instructed . So intense was the application of Miss Monroe — so unwearied was she in her practice , so quick in comprehending the instructions of the master — so resolute in surmounting all obstacles , that in the short space of two months she was a beautiful dancer . The manager was perfectly astonished at her progress ; and he pronounced a most favourable opinion upon her chance of achieving a grand triumph . Her form became all suppleness and lightness ; her powers of relaxation and abandonment of limb were prodigious . When attired in the delicate drapery of the ballet , nothing could be more beautiful — nothing more sylph - like , than the elastic airiness of her rich and rounded figure . The grace of her attitudes — the charm of her dance — the arrangement of that drapery , which revealed or exhibited the exquisite contours of her form — the classic loveliness of her countenance — the admirable symmetry of her limbs — and the brilliant whiteness of her skin , formed a whole so attractive , so ravishing , that even the envy of her sister - figurantes was subdued by a sentiment of uncontrollable admiration . In obedience to a suggestion from the manager , Ellen agreed to adopt a well - sounding name . She accordingly styled herself Miss Selina Fitzherbert . She then learned that at least two - thirds of the gentlemen and ladies constituting the theatrical company , had changed their original patronymics into convenient pseudonyms . Thus Timothy Jones had become Gerald Montgomery ; William Wilkins was announced as William Plantagenet ; Simon Snuffles adopted the more aristocratic nomenclature of Emeric Gordon ; Benjamin Glasscock was changed into Horatio Mortimer ; Betsy Podkins was distinguished as Lucinda Hartington ; Mary Smicks was displaced by Clara Maberly ; Jane Storks was commuted into Jacintha Runnymede ; and so on . In her relations with the gentlemen and ladies of the corps , Ellen ( for we shall continue to call her by her real name ) found herself in a new world . Every thing with her present associates might be summed up in the word — egotism . To hear them talk , one would have imagined that they were so many princes and princesses in disguise , who had graciously condescended to honour the public by appearing upon the stage . The gentlemen were all descended ( according to their own accounts ) from the best and most ancient families in the country ; the ladies had all brothers , or cousins , or uncles highly placed in the army or navy;—and if any one ventured to express surprise that so many well - connected individuals should be compelled to adopt the stage as a profession , the answer was invariably the same — "
327172	327184	327169	327169	I	0	" would be added , with a toss of the head , "
327211	328414	327202	327202	I	0	" Poor creatures ! this innocent little vanity was a species of reward , a sort of set - off , for long hours of toil , the miseries of a precarious existence , the moments of bitter anguish produced by the coldness of an audience , and all the thousand causes of sorrow , vexation , and distress which embitter the lives of the actor and actress . With all their little faults , Ellen found the members of the theatrical company good - natured creatures , ever ready to assist each other , hospitable and generous to a fault . In their gay moments , they were sprightly , full of anecdote , and remarkably entertaining . Many of them were clever , and exhibited much sound judgment in their remarks and critical observations upon new dramas and popular works . At length the evening arrived when Ellen was to make her first appearance upon the stage in public . The house was well attended ; and the audience was thrown into a remarkably good humour by the various performances which preceded the ballet . Ellen was in excellent spirits , and full of confidence . As she surveyed herself in the glass in her little dressing - room a few moments before she appeared , a smile of triumph played upon her lips , and lent fire to her eyes . She was indeed ravishingly beautiful . Her success was complete . The loveliness of her person at once produced an impression in her favour ; and when she executed some of the most difficult measures of the Ballonné school , the enthusiasm of the audience knew no bounds . The eyes of the ancient libertines , aided by opera - glasses and lorgnettes , devoured the charms of that beautiful girl;—the young men followed every motion , every gesture , with rapturous attention;—the triumph of the debutante was complete . There was something so graceful and yet so voluptuous in her style of dancing,—something so bewitching in her attitudes and so captivating in her manner , that she could not have failed to please . And then she had so well studied all those positions which set off her symmetrical form to its best advantage,—she had paid such unwearied attention to those measures that were chiefly calculated to invoke attention to her well - rounded , and yet light and elastic limbs,—she had so particularly practised those pauses which afforded her an opportunity of making the most of her fine person , that her dancing excited pleasure in every sense — delighting the eye , producing an effect as of a musical and harmonious feeling in the mind , and exciting in the breasts of the male portion of the spectators passions of rapture and desire . She literally wantoned in the gay and voluptuous dance ; at one moment all rapidity , grace , and airiness ; at another suddenly falling into a pause expressive of a soft and languishing fatigue;—then again becoming all energy , activity , and animation,—representing , in all its phases , the soul — the spirit — the very poetry of the dance ! At length the toils of her first performance ended . There was not a dissenting voice , when she was called for before the curtain . And then , as she came forward , led by the manager , flowers fell around her — and handkerchiefs were waved by fair hands — and a thousand enthusiastic voices proclaimed her success . Her hopes were gratified — her aspirations were fulfilled:—she had achieved a brilliant triumph ! AND now commenced a gay and busy life for Ellen Monroe . To account for her long absence each day from home , was an easy matter ; for her father was readily satisfied , so implicit was the confidence he placed in his daughter 's discretion ; and Markham was always buried amongst his books in his study , save during the intervals occupied by meals . Ellen 's salary was considerable ; and to dispose of it in a manner that was not calculated to excite the suspicion of her parent and benefactor , required more duplicity . She took home with her a small amount weekly ; and the remainder she placed in the hands of a man of business , recommended to her by the manager . Numerous attempts were made by certain young noblemen and gentlemen , who frequented the theatre , to ascertain where she resided . But this secret was unknown to every one save the manager , and he kept it religiously . Nevertheless , Ellen was persecuted by amatory letters , and by proposals of a tender nature . A certain favoured few , of the youthful fashionables above alluded to , were permitted to lounge behind the scenes during the hours of performance ; and with them Ellen was an object of powerful attraction — indeed , the object of undivided attention and interest . They perceived that she was as beautiful when surveyed near as she seemed when viewed from a distance . But , although she would lend a willing ear to the nonsense and small talk of her wooers , she gave them no direct encouragement ; and , though somewhat free , her manners never afforded a pretence even for the most daring to overstep the bounds of decency towards her . The most brilliant offers were conveyed to her in the most delicate terms ; but they were invariably declined with firmness , when oral — and left unanswered , when written . A species of mystery appeared to hang around the charming danseuse , and only served to render her the more interesting . No one knew who she was , or whence she came . Her residence was a secret ; and she was seen only at the theatre . Then she was reported to be a very paragon of virtue , and had refused the offers of titled and wealthy men . These circumstances invested her with those artificial attractions which please the public , and which , when united with her real qualifications , raised her to a splendid degree of popularity . Although her time was fully occupied , she now and then found leisure to call at the house of Mr. Wentworth , the surgeon , and pass half an hour in the company of her child . The little being throve apace ; and Ellen felt for it all a mother 's tenderness — a love which was not impaired by that callousness towards virtue for virtue 's sake , which we have before noticed , and which had been produced in her by the strange scenes through which she had passed . One evening , a short time before she was to appear in the ballet , the manager informed her that a gentleman desired to speak with her alone in the green - room . To that apartment did Ellen immediately repair , and , to her surprise , the found herself in the presence of Mr. Greenwood . "
328423	328435	328417	328417	I	0	" exclaimed that gentleman , with one of his blandest smiles . "
328480	328481	328482	328482	My	0	" "
328488	328501	328517	328517	you	0	" answered Ellen , with singular and mysterious emphasis upon the name , "
328542	328543	328547	328547	you	9815	" "
328553	328557	328547	328547	you	9815	" demanded Greenwood . "
328566	328567	328558	328558	I	0	" "
328580	328585	328570	328570	I	0	" replied Ellen warmly . "
328730	328731	328740	328740	they	9826	" "
328747	328773	328740	328740	they	9826	" demanded Greenwood , somewhat abashed by the bitterness of the under - current of reproach which had characterised the last speech of the figurante . "
328777	328781	328740	328740	they	9826	" cried Ellen . "
328785	328795	328796	328796	I	0	" she added , after a moment 's thought , "
328811	328812	328796	328796	I	0	" "
328822	328826	328827	328828	The child	30315	" said Greenwood . "
328840	328841	328842	328842	He	30315	" "
328853	329013	328842	328842	He	30315	" was Ellen 's reply ; and as she delivered it , she felt an emotion — almost of tenderness — in favour of the man who thus inquired , with embarrassment of manner , after the welfare of their child . Greenwood 's quick eye noticed the feeling that animated the young mother 's bosom . He took her hand , and drew her towards him . She was so exquisitely beautiful — so inviting in the light gauze garb which she wore , that Greenwood 's passions were fired , and he longed to make her his mistress . Her hand lingered in his;—he pressed it gently . She did not seem to notice the circumstance ; her eyes were cast down — she was absorbed in thought . Greenwood imprinted a kiss upon her spotless forehead . She started , hastily withdrew her hand , and cast upon him a look of mingled curiosity and reproach . "
329033	329046	329047	329048	That mother	9831	" asked Greenwood , assuming a soft and tender tone of voice . "
329050	329054	329047	329048	That mother	9831	" answered Ellen , "
329063	329064	329047	329048	That mother	9831	" "
329074	329078	329047	329048	That mother	9831	" said Greenwood . "
329090	329104	329080	329080	you	9828	" inquired Ellen , darting a searching glance at the member of Parliament . "
329111	329115	329109	329109	Ellen	1117	" exclaimed Greenwood . "
329259	329260	329254	329254	Ellen	1117	" "
329277	329281	329254	329254	Ellen	1117	" said Ellen , "
329296	329297	329292	329292	you	1117	" "
329322	329326	329292	329292	you	1117	" exclaimed Greenwood . "
329337	329345	329332	329333	every libertine	9841	" replied Ellen , with bitter irony . "
329383	329481	329374	329375	your mistress	6519	" With these words Ellen left the green - room ; and in a few minutes she appeared upon the stage — gay , animated , radiant with beauty and with smiles — the very personification of the voluptuous dance in which she shone with such unrivalled splendour . Five or six evenings after the one on which she had this interview with Greenwood , Ellen received a note by the post . It was addressed to her at the theatre , by the name which she had assumed ; and its contents ran as follows : — "
329648	330449	329599	329599	you	1117	" This note was written in a neat but curious hand , which seemed to be that of a foreigner . The reader can well imagine the painful surprise which its contents produced upon the young figurante . She however had no difficulty in fixing upon Greenwood as the person who contemplated the atrocity revealed in that note . He alone ( save the manager , who was an honourable and discreet man ) knew where she lived ; unless , indeed , some other amatory swain had followed her homeward . This idea perplexed her — it was possible ; and yet she could not help thinking that Greenwood was the person against whom she was thus warned . But who had sent her that friendly notice ? Who was the mysterious individual that had thus generously placed her upon her guard ? Conjecture was useless . She must think only of how she ought to act ! Her mind was speedily made up . She resolved to ride in the vehicle of an evening up to the very door of Markham 's house , and trust to her ingenuity for an excuse to satisfy her father relative to this apparent extravagance on her part . Both Richard and Mr. Monroe put implicit confidence in her word;—she had already satisfactorily accounted for the late hours which her attendance at the theatre compelled her to keep , by stating that she was engaged to attend private concerts and musical conversaziones at the West End — sometimes , even , at Blackheath , Kensington , and Clapham — where she presided at the piano , in which she was a proficient . Then , when she was compelled to be present at rehearsals at the theatre , she stated that she had morning concerts to attend ; and as she was not absent from home every day ( her engagement with the manager being merely to appear three nights a - week ) this system of deception on her part readily obtained credit with both Markham and her father , neither of whom could seriously object to what they were induced to believe was the legitimate exercise of her accomplishments . Accordingly , when , on the morning after the receipt of the mysterious letter , she casually mentioned that she should no longer return home of an evening by the omnibus , as she disliked the lonely walk from the main - road , where it set her down , to the Place , and that her emoluments would now permit her to enjoy the comfort and safety of a cab , both Richard and her father earnestly commended her resolution . And why did she not tell the truth at once ? wherefore did she not acknowledge the career which she was pursuing , and reveal the triumph which she had achieved ? Because she knew that both her father and Markham would oppose themselves to the idea of her exercising the profession of a dancer;—because she had commenced a system of duplicity , and was almost necessitated to persevere in it;—and because she really loved — ardently loved — the course upon which she had entered . The applause of crowded audiences — the smiles of the manager — the adulation of the young nobles and gentlemen who , behind the scenes , complimented her upon her success , her talents , and her beauty,—these were delights which she would not very readily abandon . SINCE the period when Markham had made so great a sacrifice of his pecuniary resources , in order to effect the liberation of Count Alteroni from a debtor 's prison , he had devoted himself to literary pursuits . He aspired to the honours of authorship , and composed a tragedy . All young authors , while yet nibbling the grass at the foot of Parnassus ( and how many never reach any higher ! ) attempt either poetry or the drama . They invariably fix upon the most difficult tasks ; and yet they did not begin learning Greek with Euripides , nor enter upon their initiation into the mysteries of the Latin tongue with Juvenal . There is also another fault into which they invariably fall;—and that is an extraordinary tendency to three meretricious ornaments which they seem to mistake for fine writing . Truth and nature may be regarded as a noble flock , furnishing the richest fleece to mankind ; but when a series of good writers have exhausted their fleece in weaving the fabrics of genius , their successors are tempted to have recourse to swine for a supply of materials ; and we know , besides , that in this attempt , as in the rude dramas called "
330451	330962	330980	330980	he	9859	" in the middle ages , there is great cry and little wool . It is also liable to the objection that no skill in the workmanship , or adjustment in the machinery , can give it the beauty and perfection of the raw material which nature has appropriated to the purpose of clothing her favoured offspring . Too many writers of the present day , instead of attempting to rival their predecessors in endeavouring to fabricate the genuine fleece derived from this flock of truth and nature , into new and exquisite forms , are engaged in shearing the swine . In this labour they can obtain , at best , nothing more than erroneous principles of science , worthless paradoxes , unnatural fictions , tinsel poetry and prose , and unnumbered crudities . Richard Markham was not exempted from these faults . He wrote a tragedy — abounding in beauties , and abounding in faults . The most delicious sweets , used in undue proportions with our food and drink , soon become in a high degree offensive and disgusting . Markham heaped figure upon figure — crammed his speeches with metaphors — and travelled many thousands of miles out of his way in search of a similitude , when he had a much better and more simple one close at hand . Nevertheless , his tragedy contained proofs of a brilliant talent , and , with much judicious pruning , every element of triumphant success . Having obtained the address of the private residence of the manager of one of the principal metropolitan theatres , Richard sent his tragedy to the great man . He , however , withheld his real name , for he had determined to commence his literary career under a feigned one ; so that , in case he should prove unsuccessful , his failure might not become known to his friends the Monroes , or reach the ears of his well - beloved Isabella . For the same reason he did not give his proper address in the letter which accompanied the drama ; but requested that a reply might be sent to Edward Preston , to the care of Mr. Dyson ( his solicitor ) . He did not mention to a single soul — not even to Monroe or the faithful Whittingham — the circumstance of his authorship . He reflected that if he succeeded , it would then be time to communicate his happiness ; but , that if he failed , it would be useless to wound others by imparting to them his disappointments . He had ceased to be sanguine about any thing in this world ; for he had met with too many misfortunes to anticipate much success in life ; and his only ambition was to obtain an honourable livelihood . Scarcely a week had elapsed after Markham had sent his drama to the manager , when he received a letter from this gentleman . The contents were laconic enough , but explicit . The manager "
330971	330976	330980	330980	he	9859	satisfaction;"—he congratulated the writer upon "
330988	330990	330980	330980	he	9859	effect;"—he suggested "
330998	331004	331005	331005	he	9859	" and concluded by stating that "
331020	331110	331114	331114	sir	26649	" A postscript appointed a time for an interview at the manager 's own private residence . At eleven o'clock the next morning Markham was ushered into the presence of the manager . The great man was seated in his study , dressed in a magnificent Turkish dressing - gown , with a French skull - cap upon his head , and red morocco slippers upon his feet . He was a man of middle age — gentlemanly and affable in manner — and possessed of considerable literary abilities . "
331121	331131	331114	331114	sir	26649	" said the manager , when Markham was introduced . "
331198	331199	331192	331192	you	26649	" "
331209	331213	331192	331192	you	26649	" replied Markham . "
331224	331225	331221	331221	your	0	" "
331240	331245	331221	331221	your	0	" said the manager . "
331259	331263	331265	331265	I	0	" returned Markham ; "

331288	331299	331286	331286	sir	26649	" said the manager , surveying Markham with some astonishment , "
331321	331322	331318	331318	your	26649	" "
331346	331347	331327	331327	you	0	" "
331353	331363	331327	331327	you	0	" cried the manager , pleased at this compliment , "
331458	331459	331460	331460	I	0	" "
331470	331479	331460	331460	I	0	" answered Richard , overjoyed at the proposal . "
331496	331544	331460	331460	I	0	" said the manager ; then , taking a well - filled canvass bag from his desk , he counted down fifty guineas in notes , gold , and silver . Markham gave a receipt , and they exchanged undertakings specifying the conditions proposed by the manager . "
331555	331565	331547	331547	you	0	" inquired Richard , when this business was concluded . "
331571	331576	331578	331578	you	1260	" said the manager . "
331611	331612	331613	331613	I	0	" "
331621	331625	331613	331613	I	0	" answered Markham ; "

331641	331648	331631	331631	my	0	" said the manager , smiling , "
331716	332345	332346	332346	Your	9868	" Markham expressed his gratitude to the manager for the kindness with which he had received him , and then took his leave , his heart elated with hope , and his mind relieved from much anxiety respecting the future . When he left the manager 's residence he repaired to an adjacent tavern to procure some refreshment ; and there , while engaged in the discussion of a sandwich and a glass of sherry , he cast his eyes over The Times newspaper . A particular advertisement arrested his attention . A gentleman — a widower — required a daily tutor for his two young sons , whom he was desirous of having instructed in Latin , history , drawing , arithmetic , & c. The boys were respectively nine and eleven years old . The advertiser stated that any individual who could himself teach the various branches of education specified , would be preferred to a plurality of masters , each proficient only in one particular study . Personal application was to be made between certain hours . The residence of the advertiser was in Kentish Town ; and this vicinity to Markham 's own abode induced him to think seriously of offering his services . He did not feel disposed to pursue his literary labours until after the representation of his drama , as he was as yet unaware of the reception it might experience at the hands of the public;—and he was also by no means inclined to remain idle . The occupation of daily tutor in a respectable family appeared congenial to his tastes ; and he resolved to proceed forthwith to the residence of Mr. Gregory , in Kentish Town . Arrived at the house , he was admitted into the presence of a gentleman of about fifty , with a serious and melancholy countenance , prepossessing manners , and a peculiar suavity of voice that gave encouragement to the applicant . Markham told him in a few words that he was once possessed of considerable property , the greater portion of which he had lost through the unfortunate speculations of his guardian , and that he was now anxious to turn the excellent education which he had received to some advantage . Mr. Gregory had only lately arrived in London with his family , from a very distant part of the country , where he had a house and small estate ; but the recent death of a beloved wife had rendered the scenes of their wedded happiness disagreeable to him;—and this was the cause of his removal and his settlement in London . He lived in a very retired manner , and had previously known nothing of Markham — not even his name . He was therefore totally ignorant of Richard 's trial and condemnation for forgery . The young man felt the greatest possible inclination to reveal the entire facts to Mr. Gregory , whose amiable manners gave him confidence ; but he restrained himself — for it struck him that others were dependent upon him — that he ought not to stand in his own light — and that his innocence of the crime imputed to him , and the consciousness of those upright and honourable intentions which on all occasions filled his breast , were a sufficient extenuation for this silence . Mr. Gregory , who was himself a highly - educated man , soon saw that Markham was competent to teach his children all that it was desirable for them to acquire ; and he agreed to engage the applicant as his sons ' tutor . Richard offered to give him a reference to his solicitor ; but Mr. Gregory declined to take it , saying , "
332355	333546	332349	332350	Mr. Markham	874	" On the following day Richard entered upon his new avocation . He was engaged to attend at Mr. Gregory 's house from ten till three every day . The employment was a pleasant one ; and the pecuniary terms were liberal in the extreme . Gustavus and Lionel Gregory were two intelligent and handsome youths ; and they soon became greatly attached to their tutor . From the mere fact of having never been accustomed to tuition , Richard took the greater pains to explain all difficult subjects to them ; and so well did he adapt his plan of instruction to their juvenile capacities , that in the short space of a month , Mr. Gregory was himself perfectly astonished at the advance which his sons had made in their studies . He then determined that the advantages of the tutor 's abilities should be extended to his daughter , in respect to drawing ; and Miss Mary - Anne Gregory was accordingly added to the number of Markham 's pupils . Mary - Anne was , at the time of which we are writing , sixteen years of age . Delicate in constitution , and of a sweet and amiable disposition , she was an object of peculiar interest to all who knew her . Her long flaxen hair , soft blue eyes , pale countenance , and vermilion lips , gave her the appearance of a wax figure ; and her light and airy form , flitting ever hither and thither in obedience to the innocent gaiety and vivacity of her disposition , seemed that of some fairy whose destinies belonged not to the common lot of mortals . Although she was sixteen , she was considered but a mere girl ; and she romped with her brothers , and with the young female friends who occasionally visited her , with all the joyousness and glee of a child of ten years old . The animation of her countenance was on those occasions radiant and brilliant in the extreme:—a spectator could have snatched her to his arms and embraced her fondly,—not with a single gross desire — not with the shadow of an unhallowed motive ; but , in the same way as a man , who , being a parent himself , is attached to children , suddenly seizes upon a lovely little boy or girl of two or three years old , and covers its cheeks with kisses . Mary - Anne was by no means beautiful — not even pretty ; and yet there was something altogether unearthly in the whole character and expression of her countenance . It was a face of angelic interest — indicative of a mental amiability and serenity truly divine . Without possessing the ingredients of physical beauty — without regularity of feature or classical formation of head,—there was still about her an abstract loveliness , apart from shape and features , which was of itself positive and distinct , and seemed an emanation of mental qualities , infantine joyousness , and winning manners . It produced a sort of atmosphere of light around her — enveloping her as with a halo of innocence . Her face was as pale — as colourless as the finest Parian marble , but also , like the surface of that beautiful material , spotless and devoid of blemish . Her pure forehead was streaked with small azure veins : her lips were thin , and of the brightest vermilion ; and these hues placed in contrast with that delicate complexion , gave a sentiment and expression to her countenance altogether peculiar to itself . Her eyes , of a light and yet too positive a blue to be mistaken for grey , were fringed with long dark lashes , which imparted to them — ever gay and sparkling as they were — a magic eloquence as powerful as that of the most faultless beauty . And , again , in strange contrast with those dark lashes was her flaxen hair , the whole of which fell in ringlets and in waves over her shoulders and her back , no portion of it being collected in a knot behind . Then her form — it was so slight as to appear almost etherealised , and yet there was no mistaking the symmetry of its proportions . Thus — without being actually beautiful — Mary - Anne was a creature of light and joy who was calculated to interest , fascinate , and win , in a manner which produced feelings of admiration and of love . Her appearance therefore produced upon the mind an impression that she was beautiful — very beautiful ; and yet , if any one had paused to analyse her features , she would have been found to possess no real elements of physical loveliness . She was charming — fascinating — bewitching — interesting ; therefore lovely in one sense , and loveable in all respects ! Mary - Anne was a very difficult pupil to teach . In the midst of the most serious study , that charming and volatile creature would start from her chair , run to her piano , and commence a lively air , which she would leave also unfinished , and then narrate some sprightly anecdote , or utter some artless sally , which would create a general laugh . The seriousness of the tutor would be disturbed in spite of himself : and even her father , if present , could not find it in his heart to scold . The drawing would at length be resumed ; and for half an hour , the application of Mary - Anne would be intense . Then away would be flung the pencil ; and a new freak must be accomplished before the study would be resumed . Richard could not help liking this volatile , but artless and innocent creature,—as a man likes his daughter or his sister ; and she , on her part , appeared to become greatly attached to her tutor . Although Mr. Gregory followed no profession , being a man of considerable independent property , he was nevertheless much from home , passing his time either at the library of the British Museum or at his Club . Richard and Mary - Anne were thus much together,—too much for the peace of that innocent and fascinating girl ! She speedily conceived a violent passion for her tutor , which he , however , neither perceived nor returned . She was herself unaware of the nature of her own feelings towards him;—she knew as much of love and its sensations as a beauteous savage girl , in some far - off isle , knows of Christianity;—and hers was an attachment which could only be revealed to herself by some accident , which might excite her jealousy or awaken her grief . One morning , before the usual lessons of the day commenced , Mr. Gregory entered the study , and , addressing himself to Markham , said , "
333639	333640	333626	333626	we	9869	" "
333643	333649	333651	333652	Mr. Markham	874	" cried Mary - Anne ; "
333663	333664	333651	333652	Mr. Markham	874	" "
333670	333675	333651	333652	Mr. Markham	874	" said her father . "
333686	333687	333688	333688	I	0	" "
333693	333737	333688	333688	I	0	" exclaimed Mary - Anne , pouting her lips in a manner that was quite charming , and which might remind the reader of the petite moue that Esmeralda was accustomed to make in Victor Hugo 's admirable novel Notre Dame de Paris . "
333748	333756	333739	333739	you	26653	" returned her father with a smile ; "
333790	333791	333778	333779	Mr. Markham	874	" "
333813	333836	333839	333839	he	874	" said the young lady , with a little air of decision and firmness , which was quite comic in its way ; "
333843	333847	333839	333839	he	874	" she added , "
333863	333963	333964	333965	Mr. Markham	874	" Mr. Gregory surveyed his daughter with an air of astonishment . Probably he half penetrated the secret — for her passion could not be called her secret , because she was totally unconscious of the nature of her feelings , and sought to conceal nothing . Had she been aware of the real sentiment which she experienced , she would have at once revealed it ; for she was guileless and unsuspicious — ignorant of all deceit — devoid of all hypocrisy — and endowed with as much simplicity and artlessness as a child of six years old . "
333974	333987	333964	333965	Mr. Markham	874	" said Mr. Gregory , at length , with a peculiar emphasis ; "
333999	334018	333989	333989	I	0	" Mary - Anne instantly burst into tears , exclaiming , in a voice almost choked with sobs , "
334046	334224	334225	334228	A remarkable sweet creatur	9876	" And she retired in a pet to another apartment . Markham was himself astonished at this singular behaviour on the part of his interesting pupil . He was , however , far from suspecting the real cause , and took his leave with a promise to return to dinner on the following Sunday , until which time there was then an interval of five days . Three days after the one on which the above conversation took place , Markham was about to issue from his dwelling to proceed into town for the purpose of calling upon the manager , as he had that morning seen his drama advertised for early representation,—when Whittingham informed him that a young lady desired to speak to him In the drawing - room . The idea of Isabella instantly flashed through the mind of Richard:—but would she call upon him , alone and unattended ? No — for Isabella , was modesty and prudence personified . Then , who could it be ? Markham asked this question of his butler . "
334230	334234	334225	334228	A remarkable sweet creatur	9876	" said Whittingham ; "
334251	334252	334255	334255	you	9877	" "
334263	334274	334255	334255	you	9877	" cried Markham , on whom a light now broke . "
334288	334335	334285	334286	Master Richard	874	" demanded the butler , shifting his inseparable companion — the white napkin — from beneath one arm to the other . Markham repaired to the drawing - room:—his suspicions were verified;—the moment he entered the apartment , he beheld Miss Gregory seated upon the sofa . "
334341	334391	334338	334339	Mr. Markham	874	" she said , extending to him her hand , and smiling so sweetly with her vermilion lips , which disclosed a set of teeth not quite even , but as white as ivory , that Richard could not find it in his heart to be angry with her ; "
334421	334422	334413	334413	I	0	" "
334428	334432	334425	334426	Miss Gregory	1264	" said Markham , "
334456	334457	334434	334434	you	1264	" "
334460	334469	334434	334434	you	1264	" demanded Mary - Anne , in astonishment . "
334499	334500	334501	334501	My	0	" "
334523	334532	334506	334506	you	874	" interrupted Mary - Anne , laughing heartily . "
334601	334602	334588	334588	I	0	" "
334614	334618	334619	334619	he	2203	" said Richard , "
334631	334632	334619	334619	he	2203	" "
334654	334664	334646	334647	my father	2156	" said Mary - Anne , with considerable ingenuousness . "
334677	334685	334674	334674	I	0	" she added , ready to cry , "
334702	334703	334706	334707	Miss Gregory	1264	" "
334724	334736	334716	334716	I	0	" answered Markham , by way of soothing the poor girl ; "
334776	334777	334778	334778	I	0	" "
334786	334791	334778	334778	I	0	" persisted Miss Gregory , "
334839	334840	334833	334833	you	874	" "
334860	334866	334833	334833	you	874	" murmured Richard within himself . "
334945	334946	334947	334947	You	874	" "
334964	335088	334957	334957	you	874	" said Mary Ann , rising from the sofa , with tears in her eyes , and preparing — or rather affecting an intention to depart . Markham still gave her no reply . He was grieved — deeply grieved to wound her feelings ; but he thought that it would be better to allow her to return home at once , with sentiments of pique and wounded pride which would prevent a repetition of the same step , than to initiate her into those social mysteries which would only give an impulse to her lively imagination that would probably prove morally injurious to her . But Mary Anne was incapable of harbouring resentment ; and she burst into an agony of grief . "
335099	335103	335093	335093	you	874	" she exclaimed , "
335356	335461	335343	335343	I	0	" Mary - Anne had never spoken so seriously , nor in so impassioned a manner , in her life before . She was even astonished herself at the very ideas which she was now expressing for the first time , and which seemed to flow from some inward fountain whose springs she could not check . Markham was astounded . He suddenly comprehended the true situation of the innocent and artless girl in respect to himself . A pang shot through his heart when he considered the impossibility of her happiness ever being ensured by his means ; and he thought within himself , "
335479	335731	335732	335733	Mr. Markham	874	" But how could this love of hers be stifled ? how could that passion be suppressed ? All the remedies yet essayed to quench and annihilate love , have changed into poisons;—even violent and unexpected lessons will not always make the heart reflect . The more the slave bends , the heavier becomes the yoke : the more a man employs an unjust force , the more will injustice become necessary to his views . No one should attempt to exercise tyranny upon proud souls ; for he will readily learn that it is not easy to triumph over and trample on a noble love . Error succeeds error — outrage follows upon outrage — and bitterness increases like a torrent whose embankments have given way . Who can define the termination of these ravages ? Will not the tender and affectionate woman , whose love man may endeavour to stifle by coldness or neglect , perish in the ruin ? She will succumb to tears and to devouring cares — even while the love which she cherishes still preserves all its vigour , and loses nothing of its ardour through intense suffering ! Markham knew not how to reply to that affectionate girl , whose spirit he dared not break by his unkindness,—whose passion he could not return , because his heart was devoted to another,—and whose mind he was afraid to enlighten with regard to those social duties which originated in reasons and motives totally unknown to her . "
335735	335746	335732	335733	Mr. Markham	874	" said Mary - Anne , wiping away her tears , "
335775	335776	335750	335750	you	874	" "
335789	335793	335781	335782	Miss Gregory	1264	" exclaimed Markham . "
335817	335818	335801	335801	you	874	" "
335839	335846	335821	335821	I	0	" interrupted Mary - Anne pettishly . "
335856	335871	335853	335854	Miss Gregory	1264	" said Richard , cruelly embarrassed how to explain himself to the young lady ; "
335885	335886	335874	335874	you	874	" "
335892	335899	335874	335874	you	874	" exclaimed Mary - Anne quickly . "
335905	335909	335901	335901	you	874	" returned Markham . "
335928	335929	335916	335916	you	874	" "
335970	335971	335963	335963	you	874	" "
335978	335985	335963	335963	you	874	" cried Mary - Anne enthusiastically . "
335993	335994	335963	335963	you	874	" "
336036	336037	336031	336031	you	874	" "
336040	336046	336048	336048	you	874	" ejaculated Mary - Anne : "
336058	336059	336048	336048	you	874	" "
336069	336073	336048	336048	you	874	" replied Richard ; "
336080	336081	336082	336082	You	874	" "
336097	336098	336091	336091	she	5327	" "
336102	336144	336145	336146	Mr. Markham	874	" answered Richard . Mary - Anne remained silent for some moments : she appeared to reflect profoundly . A sudden glow of animation flushed her cheek:—was it a light that dawned in upon her soul ? Richard sincerely hoped so . "
336148	336189	336145	336146	Mr. Markham	874	" said Mary - Anne , rising from her seat , and speaking in a tone so serious that Richard could scarcely believe he was now listening to the once volatile , sprightly , thoughtless , and playful creature he had known,—"Mr
336299	337143	337144	337145	Mr. Markham	874	" She shook hands with Richard with her usual cordiality and warmth , and then took her departure — no longer skipping like the young fawn , but with steady and measured pace . And still that young girl did not dream that love had influenced her conduct;—she continued to believe that the sentiment she experienced was one of friendship . The idea of Richard 's marriage with another had only enlightened her in respect to those laws which , as social and sympathetic beings , we have conventionally enacted . On the ensuing Sunday Markham dined , according to engagement , with Mr. Gregory . Mary - Anne was present ; and striking was the change which had taken place in her ! Her manners were no longer gay , joyous , confiding , and full of animation . As sickness chases from the cheek the flush of hoyden health , so had a new sentiment banished that sprightliness of disposition and that liveliness of temperament which so lately had characterised this child of nature . Love , then , is omnipotent , if he can effect such changes as these ! Alas ! Love can work much for our unhappiness , but little for our felicity:—he may make the gladsome companion melancholy and serious ; but he seldom covers the countenance of the morose one with smiles ! Mary - Anne endeavoured to seem as reserved as possible with Richard ; and yet , from time to time , when she thought he did not notice her , she fixed her eyes upon him with an expression of such heart - devoted tenderness , that it seemed as if she were pouring forth her entire soul to the divinity whom she worshipped . In the grotesque and colossal sculptures , and the mountainous architectural piles of the East , we seem to behold the products of an imagination struggling with conceptions too vast for its compass , and hence endeavouring to make some approximation to the reality by heaping up the irregular and huge invisible forms;—and thus did the tortured and embarrassed mind of this poor girl , unacquainted with the precise nature of the sentiment it cherished , maintain a conflict with the feelings which oppressed it , and offer up an idolatry of its own invention to the object of its unbounded veneration . Mr. Gregory could not but perceive this change in his daughter 's behaviour ; and he was more or less at a loss to conceive the cause . He had entertained , for a few days previously , a faint suspicion that Mary - Anne had peradventure formed an attachment , which would thus account for her altered demeanour ; for since her call upon Markham , had her manners changed . But the good - hearted father was still loth to believe that his daughter 's young heart had been smitten — and for the simple reason because he did not wish it to be so . Although he respected Markham , he was like all parents , who , possessing fortunes themselves , are anxious that the suitors for their daughters ' hands should also be enabled to produce a modicum of this world 's lucre . He was therefore unwilling to admit in his own mind the conviction that his suspicion was well - founded : he fancied that change of scene or amusement would probably operate favourably upon his daughter 's mind , and bring her spirits back to their proper tone ; and in this resolution was he confirmed , when in the course of that Sunday evening , he saw the confirmation of his suspicion . He could no longer doubt:—a thousand little incidents proved to him the attachment of his daughter to Richard Markham ; and his quick glance convinced him that she was not loved by her tutor in return . That night Mr. Gregory lay awake , pondering upon the best course to pursue . At one moment he thought of communicating to Markham the state of his daughter 's heart ( for he could not suppose that Richard was aware of the passion of which he was the object ) , and permitting the young couple to look upon each other as destined to be one day united:—at another moment , he imagined that it would be better to allow things to take their chance for a short time , and thereby ascertain whether the attachment gained ground on the part of his daughter , and whether it would become mutual ( for he was entirely ignorant of Markham 's love for another ) ; and at length he resolved upon dispensing with the services of Richard , and trusting to time to eradicate the seeds of the unfortunate passion from the heart of Mary - Anne . This plan Mr. Gregory put into execution in the course of a few days — indeed , the very next time that Richard called at his house . "
337147	337152	337144	337145	Mr. Markham	874	" said the father , "
337184	337185	337186	337186	I	0	" "
337189	337193	337186	337186	I	0	" said Markham , "
337203	337204	337195	337195	I	0	" "
337214	337236	337195	337195	I	0	" interrupted Mr. Gregory , shaking Richard cordially by the hand : then , in a serious tone , he added , "
337258	337332	337252	337253	no visitors	9910	" Markham was satisfied . Mr. Gregory had heard nothing prejudicial to his character ; but he had evidently penetrated into the state of Mary - Anne 's feelings . Richard was delighted to be thus dismissed from a house where his presence was only calculated to destroy the more profoundly the peace of one of its inmates:—indeed , he himself had already entertained serious ideas of severing his connexion with that family . "
337357	337369	337352	337352	you	9911	" said Mr. Gregory , when the former rose to depart ; "
337403	337553	337352	337352	you	9911	" Richard thanked Mr. Gregory for his kindness , and took leave of him . He also bade adieu to Gustavus and Lionel , both of whom were deeply affected at the idea of losing the visits of their tutor:—but Mary - Anne had been purposely sent to pass a few days with some friends in the country . AT length the evening , upon which the tragedy was to be represented for the first time , arrived . Markham in the mean time had seen little of the manager , and had not attended a single rehearsal , his presence for that purpose not having been required . Moreover , true to his original intentions , he had not acquainted a soul with his secret relative to the drama . The manager still knew him only as Edward Preston ; and the advertisements in the newspapers had announced the "
337558	337563	337569	337593	a young author of considerable promise , but who had determined to maintain a strict incognito until the public verdict should have been pronounced upon	9913	" as one that had "
337597	337627	337569	337593	a young author of considerable promise , but who had determined to maintain a strict incognito until the public verdict should have been pronounced upon	9913	" A short time before the doors opened , Richard proceeded to the theatre , and called upon the manager , who received him in his own private apartment . "
337633	337639	337630	337631	Mr. Preston	1260	" said the theatrical monarch , "
337660	337661	337662	337662	I	0	" "
337671	337675	337664	337664	you	9915	" returned Markham . "
337687	337692	337693	337693	I	0	" said the manager . "
337720	337721	337713	337713	I	0	" "
337726	337730	337731	337735	My principal ballet - dancer	9916	" inquired Richard . "
337751	337752	337739	337745	a beautiful creature and a general favourite	9917	" "
337760	337764	337753	337753	I	0	" said Markham , "
337790	337791	337792	337792	You	0	" "
337803	337811	337792	337792	You	0	" observed the manager with a smile . "
337857	337858	337849	337849	She	1244	" "
337872	337876	337849	337849	She	1244	" said Markham . "
337879	337884	337849	337849	She	1244	" observed the manager . "
337900	337901	337902	337902	I	0	" "
337912	337916	337902	337902	I	0	" returned Markham , "
337955	337956	337958	337958	you	0	" "
337961	337966	337958	337958	you	0	" said the manager . "
337978	338202	337958	337958	you	0	" Richard promised compliance with this request , and then proceeded into the house , where he took a seat in the centre of the amphitheatre . The doors had been opened a few minutes previously , and the house was filling fast . By half - past six it was crowded from pit to roof . The boxes were filled with elegantly - dressed ladies and fashionable gentlemen : there was not room to thrust another spectator into any one point at the moment when the curtain drew up . The overture commenced . How long it appeared to Markham , passionately fond of music though he was ! At length it ceased ; and the First Act commenced . For some time a profound silence pervaded the audience:—not a voice , not a murmur , not a sigh , gave the slightest demonstration of either approbation or dislike . But , at length , at the conclusion of a most impressive soliloquy , which was delivered by the hero of the piece , one universal burst of applause broke forth ; and the theatre rang with the sounds of human tongues and the clapping of hands . When the First Act ended , the opinion of the audience was decisive in favour of the piece ; and the manager felt persuaded that "
338208	338619	337958	337958	you	0	" This was one of the happiest moments of Markham 's existence — that existence which had latterly presented so few green spots to please the mental eye of the wanderer in the world 's desert . His veins seemed to run with liquid fire!—a delirium of joy seized upon him — he was inebriated with excess of bliss . Around him the spectators were expressing their opinions of the first act , little suspecting that the author of the piece was so near . All those sentiments were unequivocally in favour of the tragedy . The Second Act began — progressed — terminated . No pen can describe the enthusiasm with which the audience received the development of the drama , nor the interest which it seemed to excite . Inspired by the applause that greeted them , the performers exerted all their efforts ; and the excellence of the tragedy , united with the talent of the actors and the beauty of the scenery , achieved a triumph not often witnessed within the walls of that or any other theatre . The Third Act commenced . Selina Fitzherbert appeared upon the stage ; and her presence was welcomed with rapturous applause . She came forward , and acknowledged the kindness of the audience with a graceful curtsey . Markham surveyed her with interest , in consequence of the manner in which her name had been mentioned to him by the manager;—but that interest grew more profound , and was gradually associated with feelings of extreme surprise , suspense , and uncertainty , for he fancied that if ever he saw Ellen Monroe in his life , there was she — or else her living counterpart — before him — an actress playing a part in his own drama ! He was stupefied;—he strained his eyes — he leant forward — he borrowed the opera - glass of a gentleman seated next to him;—and the more he gazed , the more he felt convinced that he beheld Ellen Monroe in the person of Selina Fitzherbert . At length the actress spoke : wonder upon wonder — it was Ellen 's voice — her intonation — her accent — her style of speaking . Markham was amazed — confounded . He inquired of his neighbour whether Selina Fitzherbert was the young lady 's real name , or an assumed one . The gentleman to whom he spoke did not know . "
338629	338630	337958	337958	you	0	" "
338676	338929	338931	338931	you	9926	" Markham could ask no more questions ; for his neighbour became all attention towards the piece . Richard reviewed in a moment , in his mind , all the principal appearances and characteristics of Ellen 's life during the last few months,—the lateness of her hours — the constancy of her employment — and a variety of circumstances , which only now struck him , but which tended to ratify his suspicion that she was indeed Selina Fitzherbert . His attention was withdrawn from his own piece ; and he determined to convince himself at once upon this head . Taking advantage of the termination of the first scene in the third act , he left the box , and proceeded behind the scenes of the theatre . But while he was on his way thither , it struck him that if his suspicions were correct , and if he appeared too suddenly in the presence of Ellen , he would perhaps so disconcert her as to render her unfit to proceed with the part entrusted to her . He accordingly concealed himself in a dark corner , behind some scene - boards , and whence he could see plainly , but where he himself could not be very readily discovered . He did not wait long ere his doubts were cleared up . In a few minutes after he had taken his post in the obscure nook , Ellen passed close by him . She was conversing with another actress . "
338936	338941	338931	338931	you	9926	" said the latter . "
338947	338951	338931	338931	you	9926	" replied Ellen . "
338965	338966	338953	338954	the manager	34264	" "
338974	338975	338967	338967	He	9927	" "
338978	338982	338967	338967	He	9927	" said Ellen . "
339083	339084	339085	339085	I	0	" "
339093	339099	339100	339100	he	9927	" said Ellen 's companion : "
339105	339309	339310	339310	author	9934	" The two ladies passed on ; and Richard heard no more . His doubts were , however , cleared up:—Ellen Monroe was a figurante and an actress ! He was not so annoyed at this discovery as Ellen had imagined he would have been when she took such precautions to conceal the fact from the knowledge of him and her father . Richard could not help admiring the independent spirit which had induced her to seek the means of earning her own livelihood , and which he now fully comprehended:—at the same time , he was sorry that she had withheld the truth , and that she had embraced the stage in preference to any other avocation . Alas ! he little suspected what scenes that poor girl had passed through:—he knew nothing of her connexion with the statuary , the artist , the sculptor , the photographer , Greenwood , and the mesmerist ! Having satisfied himself that Selina Fitzherbert and Ellen Monroe were one and the same person , and still amazed and bewildered by the discovery , Markham returned to the body of the theatre ; but , instead of proceeding to his former seat , he repaired to the "
339314	339594	339310	339310	author	9934	" which he found unoccupied , and which , being close to the stage , commanded a full view of the scene . The tragedy proceeded with unabated success : the performance of Ellen was alone sufficient to give it an extraordinary éclat . Her beautiful countenance — the noble and dignified manner in which she carried her classic head — her elegant form — the natural grace and suavity of her manners — her musical voice — and the correct appreciation she evinced of the character in which she appeared,—these were the elements of an irresistible appeal to the public heart . The tragedy would have been eminently successful by reason of its own intrinsic merits , and without Ellen:—but with her , that success was brilliant — triumphant — unparalleled in the annals of the modern stage ! The entire audience was enraptured with the charming woman who shone in two ways so essentially distinct,—who had first captivated the sense as a dancer , and who now came forth a great tragic actress . Her lovely person and her talents united , formed a passport to favour which not a dissentient voice could question;—and when the curtain fell at the close of the fifth act , the approbation of the spectators was expressed with clapping of hands , waving of handkerchiefs , and shouts of applause — all prolonged to an unusual length of time , and frequently renewed with additional enthusiasm . The moment the curtain fell Markham hastened behind the scenes , and encountered Ellen in one of the slips . Hastily grasping her by the hand , he said in a low but hurried tone "
339616	339617	339619	339619	me	0	" "
339623	339649	339652	339652	you	874	" exclaimed the young actress , partially recovering from the almost overwhelming state of alarm into which the sudden apparition of Markham had thrown her : "
339656	339657	339652	339652	you	874	" "
339674	339678	339679	339679	You	9935	" said Markham . "
339688	339689	339690	339690	Your	874	" "
339695	339704	339710	339710	Ellen	1117	" cried Miss Monroe more and more bewildered . "
339727	339774	339725	339725	you	9935	" A moment 's silence had succeeded the flattering expression of public opinion which arose at the termination of the performance ; and then arose a loud cry for Selina Fitzherbert . This was followed by a call for the author , and then a thousand voices ejaculated—"Selina
339785	339813	339814	339814	You	9935	" The manager now hastened up to the place where Ellen and Richard were standing , and where the above hurried words had been exchanged between them . "
339829	339845	339823	339823	you	9935	" Ellen glanced with an arch smile towards Richard , as much as to say , "
339854	339871	339846	339846	You	9935	" Markham begged and implored the manager not to force him upon the stage;—but the call for "
339877	339883	339872	339873	Selina Fitzherbert	1244	" was peremptory ; and the "
339885	340189	339875	339876	the Author	9927	" were growing clamorous . Popular will is never more arbitrary than in a theatre . Markham accordingly took Ellen 's hand:—the curtain rose , and he led her forward . The appearance of that handsome couple — a fine dark - eyed and genteel young man leading by the hand a lovely woman,—a successful author , and a favourite actress,—this was the signal for a fresh burst of applause . Richard was dazzled with the glare of light , and for some time could see nothing distinctly . Myriads of human countenances , heaped together , danced before him ; and yet the aspect and features of none were accurately delineated to his eyes . He could not have selected from amongst those countenances , even that of his long - lost brother , or that of his dearly beloved Isabella , had they been both or either of them prominent in that multitude of faces . And Isabella was there , with her parents — impelled by the curiosity which had taken so many thither that evening . Her surprise , and that of her father and mother , may therefore well be conceived , when , in the author of one of the most successful and beautiful dramatic compositions of modern times , they recognised Richard Markham ! The applause continued for three or four minutes — uninterrupted and enthusiastic — as if some mighty conqueror , who had just released his country from the thraldom of a foreign foe , was the object of adulation . At length this expression of approbation ceased ; and the spectators awaited in suspense , and with curiosity depicted upon their countenances , the acknowledgment of the honours showered upon the author . At that moment the manager stepped forward , and said , "
340269	340294	340366	340367	Edward Preston	1260	" The manager bowed and retired . Fresh applause welcomed the announcement of the tragic author 's name ; and a thousand voices exclaimed , "
340300	340363	340366	340367	Edward Preston	1260	" By this time Markham had recovered his presence of mind and self - possession : and his joy was extreme when he suddenly recognised Isabella in a box close by the stage . Oh ! that was a glorious moment for him : she was there — she beheld his triumph — and doubtless she participated in his own happy feelings . "
340369	340428	340366	340367	Edward Preston	1260	" was re - echoed through the house . And then a dead silence prevailed . All were anxious to hear Richard speak . But just at the moment when he was about to acknowledge the honours conferred upon him and his fair companion by the audience , a strange voice broke upon the stillness of the scene . "
340440	340441	340437	340437	Preston	1260	" "
340444	340449	340437	340437	Preston	1260	" cried numerous voices . "
340455	340456	340450	340450	His	1260	" "
340466	340467	340468	340468	His	1260	" "
340473	340474	340468	340468	His	1260	" "
340479	340480	340468	340468	His	1260	" "
340483	340484	340468	340468	His	1260	" "
340493	340494	340495	340495	His	1260	" "
340504	340540	340501	340502	the Forger	9944	" A burst of indignation , mingled with strong expressions of incredulity , rose against the individual , who , from an obscure nook in the gallery , had interrupted the harmony of the evening . "
340563	340925	340550	340561	Richard Markham who was condemned to two years ' imprisonment for forgery	9945	" thundered forth the hoarse and unpleasant voice . A piercing scream — the scream of a female tone — echoed through the house : all eyes were turned towards the box whence it issued ; and a young lady , with flaxen hair and pale complexion , was seen to sink senseless in the arms of the elderly gentleman who accompanied her . And in another part of the house a young lady also sank , pale , trembling , and overcome with feelings of acute anguish , upon her father 's bosom . So deeply did that dread accusing voice affect the sensitive and astonished Mary - Anne , and the faithful Isabella ! All was now confusion . The audience rose from their seats in all directions ; and the theatre suddenly appeared to be converted into a modern Babel . Overwhelmed with shame , and so bewildered by this cruel blow , that he knew not how to act , Markham stood for some moments like a criminal before his judges . Ellen , forgetting where she was , clung to him for support . At length , the unhappy young man seized Ellen abruptly by the hand , and led her from the public gaze . The curtain fell as they passed behind the scenes . The audience then grew more clamorous — none scarcely knew why . Some demanded that the man who had caused the interruption should be arrested by the police ; but those in the gallery shouted out that he had suddenly disappeared . Others declared that the accusation ought to be investigated;—people in the pit maintained that , even if the story were true , it had nothing to do with the success of the accused as a dramatic author;—and gentlemen in the boxes expressed their determination never to support a man , in a public institution and in a public capacity , who had been condemned to infamous penalties for an enormous crime . Thus all was noise , confusion , and uproar,—argument , accusation , and recrimination,—the buzzing of hundreds of tongues,—the clamour of thousands of voices . Some called "
340928	341097	341281	341287	a young man of extraordinary talent;—but it	9947	" upon the manager for introducing a discharged convict to the notice of Englishmen 's wives and daughters,—although the persons who thus clamoured did not utter a reproach against the immoral females who made no secret of their profligacy , and who appeared nightly upon the stage as its brightest ornaments — nor did they condescend to recall to mind the vicinity of that infamous saloon which vomited forth numbers of impure characters to occupy seats by the sides of those wives and daughters , whose purity was now supposed to be tainted because a man who had undergone an infamous punishment , but who could there set no bad example , had contributed to their entertainment ! And then commenced a riot in the theatre . The respectable portion of the audience escaped from the scene with the utmost precipitation:—but the occupants of the upper region , and some of the tenants of the pit , remained to exhibit their inclination for what they were pleased to term "
341101	341238	341281	341287	a young man of extraordinary talent;—but it	9947	" The benches were torn up , and hurled upon the stage:—hats and orange - peel flew about in all directions;—and serious damage would have been done to the theatre , had not a body of police succeeded in restoring order . In the mean time Markham and Ellen had been conducted to the Green Room , where a glass of wine was administered to each to restore their self - possession . The manager was alone with them ; and when Richard had time to collect his scattered ideas , he seemed to awake as from a horrible dream . But the ominous countenance of the manager met his glance;—and he knew that it was all a fearful reality . Then did Markham bury his face in his hands , and weep bitterly — bitterly . "
341244	341249	341241	341242	young man	27227	" said the manager , "
341364	341443	341356	341356	I	0	" Markham was consoled by the language of the manager , who spoke in a kind and sympathising tone of voice . Thus the only man who would suffer in a pecuniary point of view — or , at least , he who would suffer most — by the fatal occurrence of that evening , was also the only one who attempted to solace the unhappy Markham . As for poor Ellen — she was overwhelmed with grief . "
341456	341465	341444	341444	You	0	" said Richard , after a long pause . "
341477	341478	341444	341444	You	0	" "
341489	341499	341500	341500	Your	0	" exclaimed the manager , taking Richard 's hand . "
341516	341517	341520	341520	he	9952	" "
341528	341532	341524	341524	he	9952	" cried Ellen . "
341573	341574	341587	341587	I	0	" "
341580	341585	341587	341587	I	0	" exclaimed the manager . "
341604	341605	341587	341587	I	0	" "
341608	341613	341587	341587	I	0	" said Ellen firmly : "
341642	341643	341635	341635	I	0	" "
341662	341689	341690	341690	We	9955	" said the manager , who was really alarmed at the prospect of losing a figurante of such talent and an actress of such great promise . "
341698	341715	341694	341694	I	0	" returned Ellen , unwilling to add to the annoyances of the kind - hearted manager . "
341722	341727	341716	341716	You	0	" said this gentleman , "
341748	341757	341758	341758	I	0	" Markham now rose to take his departure . "
341769	341774	341758	341758	I	0	" said the manager . "
341824	342227	341821	341822	Miss Fitzherbert	1244	" Markham cordially acceded to this suggestion ; and it was agreed that he should depart by the private door , and that Ellen should return home in the usual manner by herself . But before they separated , the two young people agreed with each other that the strictest silence should be preserved at the Place , not only with respect to the events of that evening , but also in regard to the nature of the avocations in which they had both lately been engaged . Markham succeeded in escaping unobserved from the theatre;—and , humiliated , cast down , heartbroken,—bending beneath an insupportable burden of ignominy and shame,—with the fainting form of Isabella before his eyes , and the piercing shriek of Mary - Anne , whom he had also recognised , in his ears,—he pursued his precipitate retreat homewards . But what a dread revelation had been made to him that evening ! His mortal enemy — his inveterate foe had escaped from the death which , it was hitherto supposed , the miscreant had met in the den of infamy near Bird - Cage Walk some months previously:—his ominous voice still thundered in Markham 's ears;—and our unhappy hero once more saw all his prospects ruined by the unmitigated hatred of the Resurrection Man . ELLEN retired to her private dressing - room , and hastily threw aside her theatrical garb . She assumed her usual attire , and then stole away from the establishment , without waiting to say farewell either to the manager or any of her acquaintances belonging to the company . As she left the private door of the theatre , she saw several persons loitering about — probably in hopes of catching a glimpse of the author who had been so signally disgraced that evening , and whose previous departure from the house was unperceived . She drew her veil closely over her countenance ; but not before one fellow , more impudent than the rest , and whose cadaverous countenance , shaggy eye - brows , and sinister expression , struck a momentary terror into her soul , had peered beneath her bonnet . Fortunately , as Ellen considered it , a cab was close by ; and the driver was standing on the pavement with his hand grasping the door - latch , as if he were expecting some one . "
342232	342335	341821	341822	Miss Fitzherbert	1244	" said he , as Ellen approached . Ellen answered in the affirmative , mentioned her address , and stepped into the vehicle . The driver banged the door , and mounted his box . The man with the cadaverous countenance watched Ellen into the vehicle , and exchanged a sign of intelligence with the driver . The cab then drove rapidly away . Another cab was standing at a little distance ; and into this the man with the cadaverous countenance stepped . There was already an individual in it , who , when the former opened the door , said , "
342339	342340	341821	341822	Miss Fitzherbert	1244	" "
342344	342866	341821	341822	Miss Fitzherbert	1244	" was the reply . This second cab , containing these two individuals , then followed rapidly in the traces of the first . Meantime Ellen had thrown herself back in the vehicle , and had given way to her reflections . The events of that memorable evening occupied her attention . A coincidence , of a nature fitted only for the pages of a romance , had revealed to Markham and herself the history of each other 's pursuits . While she had been following the occupation of a figurante , he was devoting his time to dramatic composition . He had retained his employment a secret : she had dissembled hers . He had accidentally applied for the patronage of the same manager who had taken her by the hand . He had assumed a false name : so had she . Chance led her to take a part in his drama;—her talent had materially contributed to its success . A triumph was achieved by each;—and then came the overwhelming , crushing denunciation which turned his joy to mourning — his honour to disgrace — his glory to shame . She felt as if she were identified with his fate in this one respect:—he was her benefactor ; she esteemed him : and she seemed to partake in his most painful emotions as she pondered upon the incidents of that evening . And then she retrospected over the recent events which had chequered her own life . The cast of her countenance embellished statues;—her likeness lent its attraction to pictures;—her bust was preserved in marble;—her entire form feasted the eyes of many a libertine in the private room of the photographic department of a gallery of science;—her virtue had become the prey of one who gave her a few pieces of paltry gold in exchange for the inestimable jewel of her purity;—her dreams had been sold to a mesmerist;—her dancing had captivated thousands;—her tragic talent had crowned the success of a drama . What remained for her now to sell ? what talent did she possess which could now be turned to advantage ? Alas ! she knew not ! Her meditations were painful ; and some time elapsed ere she awoke from her reverie . At length she glanced towards the window : the night was beautifully clear , though piercing cold — for it was now the month of December ; and the year 1839 was drawing to a close . The vehicle was proceeding along a road skirted only by a few leafless trees , and wearing an aspect strange and new to her . The country beyond , on either side , seemed to present to her view different outlines from those which frequent passage along the road leading to Markham Place had rendered familiar to her eyes . Again she gazed wistfully forth:—she lowered the window , and surveyed the adjacent scenery with redoubled interest . And now she felt really alarmed ; for she was convinced that the driver had mistaken the road . She called to him , and expressed her fears . "
342873	342888	342871	342871	ma'am	26745	" he exclaimed , without relaxing the speed at which the vehicle was proceeding ; "
342915	343107	342908	342908	ma'am	26745	" Ellen 's fears were hushed for a short time ; but as she leant partially out of the window to survey the country through which she was passing , the sounds of another vehicle behind her own fell upon her ears . At any other time this circumstance would not have produced a second thought ; but on this occasion Ellen felt a presentiment of evil . Whether the mournful catastrophe of the evening , or her recent sad reflections,—or both united , had produced this morbid feeling , we can not say . Sufficient is it for us to know that such was the state of her mind ; and then she remembered the warning contained in the letter so mysteriously sent to her a short time previously at the theatre . Again she addressed the cabman ; but this time he made no answer ; and in a few minutes he drove up to the door of a small house which stood alone by the side of that dreary road . Scarcely had he alighted from his box , when the second cab came up and stopped also . "
343112	343146	342908	342908	ma'am	26745	" demanded Ellen , now seriously alarmed . An individual , who had alighted from the second cab , hastened to open the door of the first , and assist Ellen to alight . "
343155	343222	343153	343153	Miss	27067	" he said , in a dialect and tone which denoted him to be a foreigner . Ellen saw at a glance that he was a tall elderly man , with a dark olive complexion , piercing black eyes , but by no means an unpleasant expression of countenance . He was dressed in black , and wore a large cloak hanging loosely over his shoulders . "
343227	343231	343153	343153	Miss	27067	" repeated Ellen . "
343245	343246	343254	343254	Miss	27067	" "
343256	343262	343254	343254	Miss	27067	" replied the tall stranger . "
343274	343275	343276	343277	A gentleman	26980	" "
343279	343283	343276	343277	A gentleman	26980	" cried Ellen . "
343292	343293	343289	343290	Mr. Greenwood	903	" "
343304	343504	343505	343505	Tidkins	1061	" Ellen was naturally of a courageous disposition ; and the circumstances of her life had tended to strengthen her mind . It instantly struck her that she was in the power of her persecutor 's myrmidons , and that resistance against them was calculated to produce effects much less beneficial for her than those which remonstrance and firmness might lead to with their employer . She accordingly accompanied the tall stranger into the house . But what was the astonishment of the poor creature when she encountered in the hall the very old hag whom she had known in the court in Goldenlane , and who had originally introduced her to the embraces of Mr. Greenwood ! The horrible wrinkled wretch grinned significantly , at she conducted Ellen into a parlour very neatly furnished , and where a cheerful fire was burning in the grate . Meantime the tall stranger issued forth again , and ordered the driver of the cab in which Ellen had arrived to await further instructions . He then accosted the cadaverous looking man who had accompanied him in the second cab , and who was now loitering about in front of the house . "
343507	343511	343505	343505	Tidkins	1061	" said he , "
343562	343563	343565	343565	you	1061	" "
343570	343576	343565	343565	you	1061	" exclaimed the Resurrection Man . "
343594	343595	343577	343578	Your master	27435	" "
343599	343630	343577	343578	Your master	27435	" said the tall man : and when he had seen the second cab depart , he re - entered the house . In the hall he met Mr. Greenwood . "
343640	343649	343633	343633	Filippo	1271	" said this gentleman , in a whisper . "
343669	343670	343662	343663	the lady	2373	" "
343735	343736	343731	343733	an Italian incomparable	9985	" "
343746	343755	343740	343740	sir	26649	" said Filippo , with a low bow . "
343763	343767	343740	343740	sir	26649	" returned Greenwood . "
343821	343826	343814	343814	I	0	" The Italian bowed . "
343838	343842	343832	343832	myself	0	" said Greenwood . "
343856	343860	343844	343844	I	0	" demanded Filippo . "
343871	343892	343844	343844	I	0	" The Italian valet bowed once more , and returned to the driver of the vehicle that brought Ellen thither . "
343897	343906	343844	343844	I	0	" said Filippo , in a hurried tone , "
343931	343932	343935	343935	sir	26649	" "
343937	343942	343935	343935	sir	26649	" replied the man . "
343953	343957	343935	343935	sir	26649	" continued Filippo . "
344025	344080	344081	344081	We	9999	" The cabman signified acquiescence ; and Filippo returned to the house . Meantime the old hag , as before stated , had conducted Ellen to a parlour , where the young lady threw herself upon a sofa , her mind and body being alike fatigued with the events and anxieties of the evening . "
344087	344108	344085	344085	Miss	27067	" said the old woman , lingering near the table , on which refreshments of several luxurious kinds were placed . "
344154	344155	344142	344142	I	0	" "
344163	344167	344142	344142	I	0	" said Ellen , "
344182	344183	344176	344176	I	0	" "
344208	344213	344197	344197	I	0	" returned the hag . "
344226	344230	344232	344232	I	0	" cried Ellen ; "
344237	344238	344232	344232	I	0	" "
344309	344310	344298	344298	I	0	" "
344315	344347	344313	344313	wretch	10007	" cried Ellen , exasperated more at the cool language of calculation in which the old woman spoke , than with the prospects she held out and the arguments she used . "
344352	344360	344350	344350	Miss	27067	" resumed the hag , nothing discomfited , "
344416	344444	344447	344447	Miss	10010	" And the old hag shook her head seriously , as if she had arrived at some great moral conclusion . Ellen paid no attention to her . "
344449	344454	344447	344447	Miss	10010	" continued the hag , "
344568	344604	344605	344605	Sir	26649	" The argument of the old hag was cut short by the entrance of the individual of whom she was just speaking . She left the room ; and Ellen was now alone with Greenwood . "
344622	344640	344608	344608	you	26649	" demanded Ellen , rising from the sofa , and speaking in a firm but cold tone . "
344650	344651	344648	344648	Ellen	1117	" "
344680	344689	344690	344690	you	26649	" added Miss Monroe , sinking her voice , "
344712	344713	344714	344714	My	0	" "
344787	344788	344772	344772	I	0	" "
344798	344802	344795	344796	Mr. Greenwood	903	" interrupted Ellen . "
344823	344824	344807	344807	your	903	" "
344852	344853	344854	344854	I	0	" "
344930	344931	344915	344915	I	0	" "
344936	344947	344934	344934	Ellen	1117	" thundered Greenwood , his face becoming purple with indignation . "
344984	344985	344986	344986	I	0	" "
345018	345028	345029	345029	I	0	" exclaimed Ellen in a rapid and impassioned tone . "
345158	345159	345164	345164	Ellen	1117	" "
345166	345170	345164	345164	Ellen	1117	" said Greenwood . "
345426	345436	345414	345415	The servant	2459	" added Greenwood , in a tone slightly ironical , "
345518	346214	345512	345512	I	0	" Ellen made no reply ; and Greenwood left the room . The moment she was alone , Ellen rose and hastened to the window . She drew aside the curtain , and was somewhat surprised to perceive that the casements were not barred ; for she had expected to find every precaution against escape adopted after the confident manner in which Greenwood had spoken upon that head . But her heart sank within her ; for she remembered his assurance that the house was surrounded by spies . She therefore made up her mind , after some reflection , to remain quiet until the next day , and then regulate her endeavours to escape by the aspect of the house and its locality when seen by day - light . She felt exhausted and wearied , and partook of a light refreshment . She then took a candle from the table , and proceeded up - stairs to the bed - room prepared for her . Having carefully bolted the door , she sate down to reflect upon the propriety of writing to her father the note suggested by Greenwood . She felt most acutely on the old man 's account ; and she knew that she would not be permitted to communicate with him in terms more explicit than those mentioned by her persecutor . Such terms were too vague and equivocal to be satisfactory;—and she concluded in her own mind that silence was the better alternative of the two . Having once more satisfied herself that the room was safe against all chances of intrusion , she thought of retiring to rest . She laid aside her bonnet and shawl , which she had hitherto kept on , and then took off her gown . She approached a long Psyche , or full - length mirror , that stood near the dressing - table ( for the room was elegantly furnished ) , and for a moment contemplated herself with feelings of pride and pleasure — in spite of the vexatious position in which she found herself . But vanity was now an essential ingredient of her character . It had been engendered , nurtured , and matured by the mode of life she had been compelled to adopt . And , assuredly , hers were charms of which she had full right to be proud . The mirror reflected to her eyes a countenance that had been deemed worthy to embellish a Venus on the canvass of a great painter . In that same faithful glass was also seen a form the beautiful undulations and rich contours of which were perfectly symmetrical , and yet voluptuously matured . The delicate white corset yielded with docile elasticity to the shape which no invention of art could improve . The form reduced that corset to suit its own proportions ; and in no way did the corset shape the form . Those swelling globes of snow , each adorned as with a delicate rose - bud , needed no support to maintain them in their full and natural rotundity;—the curvatures which formed the waist , were not drawn nearer to each other by the compression of the stay;—the graceful swell of the hips required no art to improve or augment its copiousness . Ellen smiled — in spite of herself,—smiled complacently — smiled almost proudly , as she surveyed her perfect form in that mirror . But , hark ! what sound is that which suddenly falls upon her ear ? She starts — looks round — and listens . Again!—that sound is repeated . This time she comprehends its source : some one is tapping gently at the side window of the room . Ellen hastily put on her gown once more , and advanced to the casement . She raised the blind , and beheld the dark form of a man mounted upon a ladder , at the window . A second glance convinced her that he was the tall Italian whom she had before seen . She approached as closely as possible , and said , in a low tone , "
346225	346226	346217	346217	you	10042	" "
346234	346251	346227	346227	I	0	" answered Filippo , in a voice so low , that his words were scarcely intelligible . "
346269	346283	346259	346259	he	0	" Without a moment 's farther hesitation , Ellen gently raised the window . "
346299	346303	346286	346286	he	0	" repeated Filippo . "
346327	346328	346329	346329	I	0	" "
346337	346352	346335	346335	you	0	" said Ellen , overjoyed at the arrival of this unlooked - for succour . "
346360	346361	346355	346355	you	0	" "
346385	346501	346502	346502	Lady	8723	" returned Filippo , speaking in a rapid whisper . In less than a minute this was done ; and Ellen once more assumed her bonnet and shawl . By the directions of Filippo she then stepped upon the window - sill : he received her in his arms , and bore her in safety to the ground . Then , taking the ladder on his shoulders , he desired her to follow him without speaking a word . They passed behind the house , and stopped for a moment at a stable where Filippo deposited the ladder . He then led the way across a field adjoining the garden that belonged to the house . "
346504	346519	346502	346502	Lady	8723	" said the Italian , when they were at some distance from the dwelling , "
346559	346560	346541	346541	I	0	" "
346571	346575	346541	346541	I	0	" answered Ellen . "
346599	346600	346603	346603	lady	8723	" "
346618	346622	346603	346603	lady	8723	" replied Filippo . "
346814	346870	346872	346872	your	8723	" Filippo opened the door of a barn , which they had just reached ; and the cabman responded to his summons . In a few minutes the vehicle was ready to depart . Ellen offered the Italian a recompense for his goodness towards her ; but he drew himself up haughtily , and said , "
346888	347071	346877	346877	I	0	" He then handed Miss Monroe into the vehicle ; and ordered the driver to conduct the lady whithersoever she commanded him . Ellen desired to be taken home to Markham Place ; the Italian raised his hat respectfully ; and the cab drove rapidly away towards London . Miss Monroe now began to reflect profoundly upon the nature of the excuse which she should offer to her father and Richard Markham , to account for her prolonged absence . We have before said that she had ceased to shrink from a falsehood ; and she had certain cogent reasons for never associating her own name with that of Greenwood;—much less would she acquaint her father or Richard with an outrage which would only induce them to adopt means to punish its perpetrator , and thus bring them in collision with him . At length she resolved upon stating that she had been taken ill at a concert where she had been engaged for the evening : this course would be comprehended by Markham , who would only have to substitute the word "
347073	347075	347303	347303	Montoni	136	" for "
347077	347302	346877	346877	I	0	" in his own imagination ; and it would also satisfy her father . We need merely add to this episode in our eventful history , that Ellen reached home safely at four o'clock in the morning , and that the excuse was satisfactory to both Markham and her father , who were anxiously awaiting her return . RETURN we once more to Diana Arlington , who still occupied the splendid mansion in Dover Street , which had been fitted up for her by the Earl of Warrington . The routine of the life of the Enchantress continued the same as we have described it in Chapter LI . The Earl of Warrington was unremitting in his attention , and unchanged in his liberality towards his beautiful mistress ; and , on her part , Diana was the faithful friend and true companion who by her correct conduct maintained the confidence which she had inspired in the heart of her noble protector . We must again introduce our readers to the Enchantress at the hour of breakfast , and in the little parlour where we have before seen her . But on this occasion , instead of being occupied with the perusal of the Morning Herald , her entire attention was absorbed in the contents of a letter , which ran as follows : — "
347310	347339	347303	347303	Montoni	136	" I sit down , my dearest Diana , to inform you that the ceremony of my union with his Serene Highness Angelo III . was solemnized yesterday . "
347550	347743	347523	347523	he	26690	" The next step adopted by his Serene Highness was to dismiss the Marquis of Gerrano from the office of Minister of Foreign Affairs . Baron Ruperto , the Under Secretary in that Department , retired with his superior . The Duke adopted this measure in consequence of the intrigues of those noblemen to thwart his Highness 's intentions of raising to the ducal throne the woman whom he loved . You may suppose how grieved — how vexed — how distressed I have been through the conviction that I myself was the cause of these heart - burnings , jealousies , and intrigues ; and although I was innocently the source of such disagreeable proceedings , my sorrow and annoyance were but little mitigated by this impression . I implored the Grand Duke to allow me to leave the country , and retire to Switzerland ; but his Serene Highness remained firm , and assured me that , although he had many difficulties to overcome , he was not disheartened . Then he declared that his entire happiness was centred in me ; and he thus over - ruled my scruples . "
347865	348012	347845	347845	his	9287	" This decision was made known on the 19th of last month . I did not write to communicate the important fact to you , because I was apprehensive of new delays ; and as I had already misled you once ( though unintentionally on my part ) I was unwilling to deceive either you or myself a second time . I know your friendship for me , Diana,—I know that you entertain a sister 's love for me , the same that I feel for you,—and I also know that you anxiously watch the progress of my fortunes , as , under similar circumstances , I should yours . I therefore resolved to acquaint you with no more of my hopes , until they should have been realised . That result has now been attained ; and I need preserve a cold silence no longer . "
348136	348541	348545	348551	the three lovely daughters of General Grachia	10094	" I can scarcely tell you the nature of the varied emotions and feelings which filled — indeed agitated — my bosom when the memorable morning dawned . That was yesterday ! I awoke at an early — a very early hour,—before six , and walked in the garden with the hope that the fresh air and the charming tranquillity of the scene would compose me . I could scarcely believe that I was on the point of entering upon such high destinies ; that a diadem was so soon to encircle my brow ; that the thrilling words Highness and Princess would in a few hours be addressed to me ! I could not reconcile with my former obscure lot the idea that I was shortly to sit upon a sovereign throne , — command the allegiance of millions of human beings,—and share the fortunes of a potentate of Europe ! Was it possible that I — I who was the daughter of a poor farmer , and who had seen so much of the vicissitudes of life,—I who had thought myself happy with the competence which I enjoyed through the Earl of Warrington 's bounty at Clapton,—I who conceived myself to be one of the most fortunate of individuals when , by the goodness of that same excellent peer , I arrived in this State , and took possession of the villa which he had placed at my disposal,—I who had then no more elevated aspirations than to dwell in tranquillity and peace — no loftier hope than to deserve that kind nobleman 's benefits by my conduct,—was it possible that I was in a few hours to become the Grand Duchess of Castelcicala ? I could not fix my mind to such a belief ; the idea seemed an oriental fiction — a romantic dream . And yet , I remembered , I had already received an earnest of this splendid promise of fortune : I had already been elevated from a lowly condition to an exalted rank ; the distinction of a Marchioness was mine ; for months had I been accustomed to the sounding title of Your Ladyship and for months had I been enrolled amongst the peeresses of Castelcicala . Yes — I thought : it was true,—true that a Prince — a powerful Prince — intended to raise me to a seat upon his own ducal throne ! "
348691	348766	348771	348771	me	0	" Here my letter must terminate . Enclosed is an account of the entire ceremony , translated into English by my private secretary ( who is well acquainted with my native tongue ) from the Montoni Gazette . Fain would I have erased those passages which are favourable — too favourable to myself ; but I fancied that my friend — my sister Diana would be pleased to read the narrative in its integrity . "
348828	348832	348845	348846	Mrs. Arlington	891	" ELIZA SYDNEY . "
348884	348892	348879	348881	the Grand Duchess	10107	" THE MARRIAGE OF THE GRAND DUKE . "
348912	349165	348907	348910	Eliza Marchioness of Ziani	1215	" From an early hour the capital wore an appearance of unusual gaiety and bustle . The houses looking on the Piazzetta of Contarini , leading to the ancient Cathedral of Saint Theodosia , were decorated in a most splendid manner with banners , garlands , festoons of flowers , and various ornaments and devices appropriate to the occasion . The balconies were fitted up as verdant bowers and arbours , and the lovely characteristics of the country were thus introduced into the very heart of the city . The Town - Hall was hung with numerous banners ; and the royal standard waved proudly over the Black Tower of the Citadel . The shops in those streets through which the procession was to pass were fitted up with seats which were let to those who were willing to pay the high prices demanded for them . In other parts of the city the shops and marts of trade were all closed , as was the Exchange . A holiday was observed at the Bank of Castelcicala ; and the business of the General Post Office closed at eleven o'clock in the forenoon . Nor was the port less gay than the city . All the vessels in the harbour and docks , as well at those in the roadstead , were decked with innumerable flags . The royal standard floated from the main of the ships of war of the Castelcicalan navy . The sight was altogether most imposing and lively . "
349410	349574	349575	349576	The procession	10136	" At half - past ten o'clock the President of the Council , the Grand Chancellor , and the Intendant of the Ducal Civil List arrived in their carriages at General Grachia 's abode , preceded by one of the royal equipages , which was sent to convey the bride and her ladies - in - waiting to the palace . In a few minutes the President of the Council handed the bride , who was attended by the lady and three lovely daughters of General Grachia , into the ducal carriage . The procession then repaired to the palace , the crowds that lined the streets and occupied the windows and balconies by which it passed , expressing their feelings by cheers and the waving of handkerchiefs . To these demonstrations the bride responded by graceful bows , bestowed in a manner so modest and yet evidently sincere , that the conduct of this exalted lady upon the occasion won all hearts . "
349745	349889	349890	349891	The bride	34963	" This was the signal for the roar of artillery from all points . The citadel , and the ships of war in the roadstead thundered forth the announcement that his Serene Highness had just left the palace . The bells rang blithely from every steeple ; the troops presented arms , the military bands played the national hymn ; and the procession was welcomed with joyous shouts , the waving of handkerchiefs , and the smiles of beauty . The windows and balconies of the houses overlooking the streets through which it passed , were crowded with elegantly dressed ladies , brilliant with their own beauty , gay with waving plumes , and sparkling with diamonds . The only indication of political feeling which we observed upon the occasion , was on the part of the troops ; and they were silent . "
349999	350191	349980	349980	She	10160	" At length the cavalcade reached the cathedral , where the Archbishop of Montoni , assisted by the Bishops of Trevisano and Collato , was in attendance to perform the solemn ceremony . The sacred edifice was thronged by the élite and fashion of the capital , who had been admitted by tickets . When the royal party had entered the Cathedral , the doors were closed ; and the holy ceremony was solemnised . The roar of the artillery was again heard , as the royal party returned to their carriages . This time the Grand Duchess was handed by his Serene Highness into the state carriage . The return to the palace was distinguished by demonstrations of satisfaction on the part of the spectators more enthusiastic , if possible , than those which marked the progress of the cavalcade to the cathedral . A glow of animation was visible upon the countenance of her Serene Highness ; and the Grand Duke himself looked remarkably well and cheerful . In a short time the Sovereign conducted his lovely bride into that palace which in future is to be her home . "
350453	350554	350437	350437	we	10176	" Scarcely had the Enchantress terminated this narrative of the ceremony which elevated her friend to a ducal throne,—a narrative which she had perused with the liveliest feelings of satisfaction , and the most unadulterated pleasure,—when the Earl of Warrington was announced . Diana hastened to communicate to him the tidings which she had received ; and the nobleman himself read Eliza 's letter , and the extract from the Montoni Gazette , with an interest which showed how gratified he felt in the high and exalted fortunes of the daughter of her whom he had once loved so tenderly . "
350559	350575	350437	350437	we	10176	" said the earl , when he had terminated the perusal of the two documents , "
350601	350602	350594	350594	she	1216	" "
350615	350619	350594	350594	she	1216	" remarked Diana . "
350625	350630	350594	350594	she	1216	" observed the earl ; "
350722	350747	350700	350700	Stephens	899	" exclaimed the earl , who was carelessly turning the letter of the Grand Duchess over and over in his hands as he spoke , "
350754	350770	350700	350700	Stephens	899	remarkable;"—and he inspected the seal and post - marks of the letter with minute attention . "
350776	350780	350700	350700	Stephens	899	" inquired Diana . "
350788	350798	350700	350700	Stephens	899	" answered the earl , still continuing his scrutiny : "
350811	350812	350700	350700	Stephens	899	" "
350815	350819	350700	350700	Stephens	899	" cried Diana . "
350822	350829	350700	350700	Stephens	899	" said the Earl of Warrington ; "
350899	350900	350889	350889	you	1273	" "
350903	350907	350889	350889	you	1273	" said Diana : "
350938	350939	350923	350923	herself	10107	" "
350949	350963	350947	350947	Diana	1273	" said the earl , in a serious — almost a solemn tone , "
350988	350989	350981	350981	you	1273	" "
350992	351041	350981	350981	you	1273	" replied Diana ; and she hastily unlocked her writing - desk , where she produced all the correspondence she had received from Eliza Sydney . The earl carefully inspected the envelopes of those letters ; and his countenance grew more serious as he proceeded with his scrutiny . "
351044	351053	350981	350981	you	1273	" he exclaimed , after a long pause ; "
351117	351118	351114	351115	the receiver	10190	" "
351127	351128	351129	351129	I	0	" "
351135	351147	351114	351115	the receiver	10190	" said the Earl of Warrington , interrupting his fair mistress , "
351187	351188	351191	351191	you	0	" "
351193	351197	351191	351191	you	0	" inquired Diana : "
351205	351206	351202	351202	you	0	" "
351214	351221	351202	351202	you	0	" replied the Earl of Warrington . "
351228	351241	351202	351202	you	0	" cried Mrs. Arlington , her countenance expressing the most profound astonishment . "
351248	351253	351202	351202	you	0	" repeated the earl . "
351312	351358	351359	351359	I	0	" The earl consigned the letters to his pocket , and , with an air of deep determination , took a temporary leave of Mrs. Arlington . Scarcely had the earl left the house , when Mr. Greenwood 's valet , Filippo , was introduced . "
351365	351370	351359	351359	I	0	" said the Italian , "
351398	351399	351375	351375	I	0	" "
351407	351412	351405	351405	Filippo	1271	" exclaimed Mrs. Arlington . "
351419	351420	351427	351427	madam	26758	" "
351481	351482	351483	351483	I	0	" "
351507	351512	351483	351483	I	0	" observed Mrs. Arlington . "

351545	351549	351551	351551	I	0	" replied Filippo . "
351559	351564	351551	351551	I	0	" said Mrs. Arlington . "
351598	351599	351600	351600	I	0	" "
351611	351615	351600	351600	I	0	" answered Filippo ; "
351620	351628	351630	351630	I	0	" he added , suddenly recollecting himself , "
351651	351652	351645	351649	a certain Sir Rupert Harborough	10213	" "
351657	351668	351671	351671	madam	26758	" ejaculated Diana , a blush suddenly overspreading her cheeks . "
351723	351724	351721	351721	himself	887	" "
351728	351732	351736	351736	madam	26758	" cried Diana . "
351818	351819	351836	351836	his	887	" "
351829	351833	351834	351834	He	887	" inquired Diana . "
351870	351871	351867	351867	his	887	" "
351884	351894	351895	351895	I	0	" said Diana , after a moment 's hesitation . "
351932	351955	351923	351923	He	887	" she added , musing to herself rather than addressing the Italian valet : then , suddenly recollecting herself , she said , "
351967	351968	351923	351923	He	887	" "
351974	352310	351972	351972	madam	26758	" replied the valet ; and he then took his departure . The moment he was gone , Mrs. Arlington threw herself into her comfortable arm - chair , and became wrapt up in deep thought . IN a well furnished room , on the first - floor of the Home Office , sate the Secretary of State for that Department . The room was spacious and lofty . The walls were hung with the portraits of several eminent statesmen who had , at different times , presided over the internal policy of the country . A round table stood in the middle of the apartment ; and at this table , which groaned beneath a mass of papers , was seated the Minister . At the feet of this functionary was a wicker basket , into which he threw the greater portion of the letters addressed to him , and over each of which he cast a glance of such rapidity that he must either have been a wonderfully clever man to acquire a notion of the contents of those documents by means of so superficial a survey , or else a very neglectful one to pay so little attention to affairs which were associated with important individual interests or which related to matters of national concern . The time - piece upon the mantel struck twelve , when a low knock at the door of the apartment elicited from the Minister an invitation to enter . A tall , thin , middle - aged , sallow - faced person , dressed in black , glided noiselessly into the room , bowed obsequiously to the Minister , and took his seat at the round table . This was the Minister 's private secretary . The secretary immediately mended a pen , arranged his blotting - paper in a business - like fashion before him , spread out his foolscap writing paper , and then glanced towards his master , at much as to say , "
352315	352316	351972	351972	madam	26758	" "
352327	352332	352324	352324	you	0	" said the Minister , "
352341	352342	352324	352324	you	0	" "
352348	352377	352324	352324	you	0	" said the Secretary ; and he glanced cursorily over the letters alluded to , one after the other , briefly mentioning their respective objects as he proceeded . "
352479	352480	352465	352465	he	917	" "
352489	352495	352482	352482	you	10230	" demanded the Home Secretary . "
352508	352509	352482	352482	you	10230	" "
352515	352520	352482	352482	you	10230	" replied the Secretary . "
352570	352571	352574	352575	a barber	29574	" "
352579	352587	352574	352575	a barber	29574	" said the Home Secretary , yawning . "
352622	352623	352598	352599	young Medhurst	1279	" "
352634	352639	352640	352640	Medhurst	1279	" exclaimed the Minister . "
352653	352654	352650	352651	a barber	29574	" "
352663	352668	352650	352651	a barber	29574	" said the Secretary . "
352675	352676	352650	352651	a barber	29574	" "
352695	352696	352688	352689	William Lees	917	" "
352700	352717	352688	352689	William Lees	917	lord;"—and the Secretary , having endorsed the note upon the letter , referred to another document . "
352768	352769	352764	352764	He	10244	" "
352778	352783	352764	352764	He	10244	" interrupted the Minister . "
352816	352817	352821	352822	my lord	27330	" "
352881	352882	352878	352879	your lordship	28358	" "
352897	352902	352878	352879	your lordship	28358	" said the Minister . "
352916	352921	352904	352904	I	0	" asked the Secretary . "
352924	352929	352931	352931	you	0	" repeated the Minister : "
353083	353084	353087	353088	my lord	27330	" "
353090	353104	353087	353088	my lord	27330	" said the Secretary , evidently struck by this display of ministerial wisdom . "
353260	353261	353241	353241	he	10268	" "
353269	353274	353241	353241	he	10268	" said the Minister : "
353297	353298	353301	353302	my lord	27330	" "
353304	353453	353301	353302	my lord	27330	" replied the Secretary . At this moment a gentle knock was heard at the door of the apartment . The Secretary hastened to respond to the summons , and admitted two persons dressed in plain but decent attire . One was a short , stout , red - faced , consequential - looking man : the other was a tall , raw - boned , ungainly person , and seemed quite confounded at the presence in which he found himself . The former of these individuals was an inspector of police : the latter was a common police - officer . Indeed , the reader has been already introduced to them , in the fourteenth chapter of this narrative . Having ushered these individuals into the room , the private secretary hastened to breathe a few words in an under tone to the ear of his master . "
353464	353470	353473	353474	my lord	27330	" said the Minister aloud . "
353476	353492	353473	353474	my lord	27330	" replied the Secretary ; then , addressing the police - officers , he exclaimed . "
353539	353587	353588	353588	You	10284	" Both the Minister and Secretary were cautious enough not to give those instructions in their own handwriting . The men sate down , as they were desired ; and the inspector whispered to his companion an order to assume the duties of amanuensis on the occasion . "
353596	353601	353588	353588	You	10284	" said the Minister , "
353620	353621	353624	353625	my lord	27330	" "
353627	353632	353624	353625	my lord	27330	" replied the inspector . "
353645	353650	353624	353625	my lord	27330	" continued the Minister , "
353667	353668	353671	353672	my lord	27330	" "
353674	353679	353671	353672	my lord	27330	" said the inspector . "
353689	353690	353681	353681	Crisp	939	" "
353708	353717	353681	353681	Crisp	939	" answered the Minister , with a smile . "
353762	353763	353766	353767	my lord	27330	" "
353775	353776	353773	353773	Crisp	939	" "

354141	354146	354134	354134	he	27233	" continued the Minister , "
354176	354177	354180	354181	my lord	27330	" "
354189	354190	354187	354187	Crisp	939	" "
354194	354206	354187	354187	Crisp	939	" said the Minister , turning towards his own private secretary , "
354283	354284	354288	354289	my lord	27330	" "
354291	354296	354288	354289	my lord	27330	" replied the Secretary . "
354317	354318	354308	354309	your lordship	28358	" "
354321	354326	354308	354309	your lordship	28358	" said the Minister . "
354357	354358	354360	354361	your lordship	28358	" "
354363	354368	354360	354361	your lordship	28358	" exclaimed the inspector . "
354390	354415	354384	354385	his lordship	3013	" Mr. Crisp acted in all respects as he was desired ; and having each made an awkward bow , the two officers retired . "
354422	354427	354384	354385	his lordship	3013	" said the Minister . "
354433	354438	354384	354385	his lordship	3013	" replied the Secretary . "
354573	354574	354561	354561	He	31985	" "
354578	354583	354561	354561	He	31985	" answered the Minister . "
354671	354672	354675	354676	my lord	27330	" "
354807	354808	354780	354781	The agent	10369	" "

354962	354967	354950	354960	rich and influential men , whom it is necessary to conciliate	10384	" said the Minister . "

354981	354986	354950	354960	rich and influential men , whom it is necessary to conciliate	10384	" continued the Secretary , "
355142	355143	355184	355186	Sir Joseph Gosborne	1155	" "
355188	355215	355184	355186	Sir Joseph Gosborne	1155	" While the private secretary was still writing , a servant entered and informed the Minister that Mr. Teynham was waiting , and solicited an audience . "
355225	355231	355233	355233	him	10398	" exclaimed the Home Secretary . "
355236	355278	355233	355233	him	10398	" Mr. Teynham , a middle - aged gentleman attired in black , was introduced accordingly . He bowed very low to the Minister , and , when desired to take a chair , obsequiously seated himself upon the very edge . "
355290	355295	355284	355285	Her Majesty	31600	" said the Minister , "
355334	355352	355322	355323	her Majesty	31600	" Mr. Teynham bowed very low , and became entangled in a labyrinth of acknowledgments , with which "
355354	355356	355322	355323	her Majesty	31600	gratitude"—"sense of duty"—"impartial
355361	355369	355322	355323	her Majesty	31600	" and such like phrases were blended . "
355374	355383	355322	355323	her Majesty	31600	" said the Minister , after a pause , "
355467	355468	355469	355469	I	0	" "
355489	355490	355493	355494	Mr. Teynham	1281	" "
355498	355503	355493	355494	Mr. Teynham	1281	" cried the Minister : "

355601	355609	355595	355595	I	0	" said the newly - made magistrate . "

355633	355656	355630	355631	Mr. Teynham	1281	" said the Minister , with the most condescending affability , or the most affable condescension — whichever the reader likes best . "
355781	355782	355773	355773	I	0	" "
355794	355799	355773	355773	I	0	" said the Minister : "

355885	355890	355873	355874	your lordship	28358	" returned the Minister . "

356193	356198	356180	356181	Your lordship	28358	" said Mr. Teynham . "
356203	356208	356180	356181	Your lordship	28358	" continued the Minister , "
356360	356361	356362	356362	Your	1155	" "
356369	356375	356362	356363	Your lordship	28358	" was the submissive answer . "
356388	356394	356382	356382	I	0	" said the Home Secretary . "
356485	356525	356526	356526	his	1281	" The newly - made magistrate rose , bowed several times , and withdrew , walking obsequiously upon the points of his toes for fear his boots should creak in the awful presence of the Home Secretary . But if "
356528	356601	356602	356605	The Earl of Warrington	28357	" were thus meek and lowly before his patron , he afterwards avenged himself for that constraint , when seated in the magisterial chair , upon the poor devils that appeared before him ! The private secretary was about to proceed with the correspondence addressed from different quarters to the Minister , when a servant entered the room , and placed a card upon the table before this great officer of state . "
356607	356612	356602	356605	The Earl of Warrington	28357	" said the Minister . "
356618	356662	356663	356663	I	0	" The servant withdrew , and the private secretary retired to an inner apartment . In a few moments the Earl of Warrington was announced . When the usual civilities had been exchanged between the two noblemen , the Earl of Warrington said , "

356831	356836	356804	356804	I	0	" said the Minister . "

356911	356929	357008	357009	my lord	27330	" said the Minister , not a muscle of whose countenance moved as he heard this communication . "

356951	356958	356948	356948	I	0	" returned the Earl of Warrington , "

356980	357005	356948	356948	I	0	" ejaculated the Minister , with an air of great surprise — whether real or affected , we must leave our readers to determine . "
357017	357026	356948	356948	I	0	" said the Earl of Warrington , firmly . "
357030	357058	356948	356948	I	0	these;"—and , extracting the letters from his pocket , he pointed out to the Minister the same appearances which he had ere now explained to Mrs. Arlington . "
357064	357069	357070	357070	I	0	" said the Minister , "
357078	357079	357070	357070	I	0	" "

357123	357129	357120	357120	I	0	" observed the Minister inquiringly . "
357160	357161	357162	357162	Your	27330	" "
357184	357197	357178	357182	the Post - Master General	10503	" said the Minister , darting a keen glance upon the earl . "
357210	357215	357198	357198	I	0	" was the answer . "
357247	357252	357237	357238	some clerk	10505	" said the Minister . "
357330	357331	357335	357335	your	27330	" "
357339	357351	357352	357352	I	0	" inquired the Minister , with a trifling uneasiness of manner . "

357399	357400	357382	357382	I	0	" "

357568	357576	357552	357553	your lordship	28358	" said the Earl of Warrington coldly . "
357611	357612	357586	357587	your lordship	28358	" "
357621	357629	357614	357619	a nobleman devoted to my country	10524	" exclaimed the Earl of Warrington proudly , "
357661	357662	357663	357664	Your lordship	28358	" "
357668	357673	357663	357664	Your lordship	28358	" said the Minister . "
357732	357733	357734	357735	Your lordship	28358	" "
357739	357746	357734	357735	Your lordship	28358	" said the Minister , now really alarmed,—"your
357756	357757	357734	357735	Your lordship	28358	" "
357768	357769	357734	357735	Your lordship	28358	" "
357777	357778	357734	357735	Your lordship	28358	" "

357835	357840	357829	357830	Your lordship	28358	" said the Minister . "
357929	357930	357920	357920	I	0	" "
357975	357992	357972	357973	my lord	27330	" continued the Minister , with a smile whose deceptive blandness Mr. Greenwood would have envied , "
358048	358049	358050	358050	Her	10549	" "
358055	358065	358050	358050	Her	10549	" replied the earl with chilling — freezing hauteur , "
358125	358246	358122	358123	my lord	27330	" And the Earl of Warrington walked proudly from the room . On the following day a cabinet council was held at the Home Office . IT was evening ; and Lady Cecilia Harborough was seated alone in the drawing - room of the house which she and her husband occupied in Tavistock Square . A cheerful fire blazed in the grate : the lamp upon the table diffused a soft and mellow lustre through the apartment . Lady Cecilia 's manner was pensive : a deep shade of melancholy overspread her countenance ; and at times her lips quivered , and her bosom heaved convulsively . She was evidently attempting to struggle with feelings of a very painful nature . "
358254	358260	358294	358294	his	3239	" she at length murmured . "
358757	359208	359211	359211	Cecilia	1008	" Lady Cecilia paused , and compressed her lips together . She felt herself slighted — perhaps for some rival : and whose sufferings are more acute than those of a neglected woman ? who experiences mental pangs more poignant ? Lady Cecilia felt herself degraded . She now comprehended that she had been made the instrument of a heartless libertine 's pleasures ; and that he coolly thrust her aside when literally satiated with her charms . This was a most debasing conviction — debasing beyond all others , for a patrician lady ! Never did she seem so little in her own estimation : she felt polluted;—she saw that she had sold herself for gold : she remembered how willingly , how easily she surrendered herself on the first occasion of her criminality ; and she despised herself , because she felt that Greenwood despised her also ! She had no virtue — but she had pride . The highest bidder might enjoy her person , so voluptuous was she by nature — so ready also was she to make any sacrifice to obtain the means of gratifying her extravagance . Love with her was not a refinement — it was a sensuality . Still she had her pride — her woman 's pride ; for even the most degraded courtezan has that ; and it was her pride that was now so deeply wounded . She knew not what course to pursue . Should she endeavour to bring Greenwood back to her arms ? Or should she be revenged ? If she resolved upon the former , what wiles was she to adopt — what artifices to employ ? If she decided upon the latter , what point in her neglectful lover was vulnerable — what weapon could she use ? A woman does not like to choose the alternative of vengeance , because such a proceeding implies the absence of all hope and of all power of recalling the faithless one . And yet what was Lady Cecilia to do ? That refusal of the money which she had requested , appeared expressive of Mr. Greenwood 's determination to break off the connexion . In that case nothing remained to her but vengeance . Such were her thoughts . Her reverie was interrupted by the sudden entrance of her husband Sir Rupert Harborough . His face was flushed with drinking — for he had dined , with his friend Chichester , at a tavern ; and his cares had forced him to apply with even more than usual liberality to the bottle . He threw himself into a chair opposite to his wife , and said , "
359223	359224	359227	359228	Sir Rupert	887	" "
359230	359255	359256	359256	I	0	" she said , in a tone which signified that she also had her annoyances , and would rather not be troubled with his . "
359263	359268	359272	359272	Cecilia	1008	" cried the baronet . "
359287	359294	359272	359272	Cecilia	1008	" Lady Cecilia only laughed ironically . "
359305	359310	359295	359295	You	1008	" said Sir Rupert ; "
359324	359325	359312	359312	I	0	" "
359342	359347	359327	359327	I	0	" returned the lady . "
359371	359372	359391	359391	I	0	" "
359405	359406	359391	359391	I	0	" "

359433	359434	359415	359415	I	0	" "
359437	359443	359415	359415	I	0	" cried the baronet impatiently . "
359451	359456	359415	359415	I	0	" returned Lady Cecilia . "
359473	359474	359475	359476	Lady Cecilia	1008	" "
359516	359517	359518	359518	Our	10571	" "
359521	359525	359518	359518	Our	10571	" ejaculated Cecilia . "
359530	359536	359518	359518	Our	10571	" repeated the baronet emphatically . "
359551	359674	359675	359676	My God	27430	" To a person who had not the means of obtaining even the tenth part of that sum , and who had herself been disappointed that very evening in her endeavour to procure a hundred guineas , the question put by the baronet appeared in so ridiculous a light , that — in spite of her own annoyances — Lady Cecilia threw herself back in her chair , and burst into a loud and hearty laugh . Sir Rupert rose and paced the room in an agitated manner ; for he was totally at a loss what course to pursue . His only hope was in his wife ; and yet he knew not how to break the fatal news to her . "
359680	359695	359678	359678	Cecilia	1008	" he exclaimed , after a pause , during which he resumed his seat , "
359702	359703	359696	359696	you	1008	" "
359752	359753	359754	359754	My	0	" "

359883	359888	359880	359881	Sir Rupert	887	" answered the lady . "

360052	360097	360098	360098	Madam	26758	" And as she uttered these words , a smile of superb contempt curled her vermilion lips . Sir Rupert was maddened by this behaviour on the part of his wife ; and with difficulty could he restrain his feelings of rage and hatred . "
360100	360104	360098	360098	Madam	26758	" he exclaimed , "
360127	360128	360129	360129	I	0	" "
360139	360143	360136	360137	Sir Rupert	887	" answered Cecilia ; "

360227	360232	360225	360225	Cecilia	1008	" cried the baronet . "

360459	360464	360456	360456	your	1008	" persisted the baronet . "

360627	360636	360637	360637	I	0	" cried Lady Cecilia , now really alarmed . "

360667	360676	360657	360657	I	0	" repeated Lady Cecilia , turning deadly pale . "

360851	360862	360842	360842	you	1008	" said the baronet , in a tone of despair . "
360905	360906	360907	360908	Mr. Greenwood	903	" "
360968	360969	360961	360961	he	1006	" "
360984	360989	360975	360975	I	0	" began Lady Cecilia : "

361000	361018	361019	361019	I	0	" said Sir Rupert , fixing his eyes in a significant manner upon his wife 's countenance ; "
361048	361049	361040	361040	you	1008	" "
361058	361080	361052	361052	you	1008	" exclaimed Cecilia , a deep blush suffusing her face , and her eyes sinking beneath her husband 's expressive look . "
361090	361095	361088	361088	Cecilia	1008	" returned the baronet . "
361138	361139	361129	361129	I	0	" "
361147	361158	361142	361142	you	1008	" asked the guilty wife , in a trembling voice . "

361215	361228	361212	361213	Lady Cecilia	1008	" interrupted the baronet , speaking in a slow and emphatic manner , "
361251	361252	361253	361254	Sir Rupert	887	" "
361263	361264	361261	361261	you	1008	" "
361273	361279	361268	361268	I	0	" added the baronet sternly . "

361310	361314	361307	361307	I	0	" ejaculated Cecilia . "

361340	361346	361307	361307	I	0	" interrupted the baronet impatiently . "

361372	361377	361378	361378	I	0	" cried Lady Cecilia . "
361396	361397	361383	361384	Mr. Greenwood	903	" "
361401	361418	361383	361384	Mr. Greenwood	903	" said the baronet , whose turn to assume a tone of raillery had now arrived : "
361428	361429	361436	361436	he	903	" "
361441	361446	361436	361436	he	903	" continued Lady Cecilia ; "
361460	361461	361452	361452	he	903	" "
361468	361473	361466	361466	Cecilia	1008	" demanded Sir Rupert . "
361479	361566	361477	361477	yourself	26758	" said the lady ; and drawing a note from her bosom , she handed it to her husband . The correspondence that passed between Mr. Greenwood and Lady Cecilia was always of a laconic and most guarded nature : there was consequently nothing in the letter now communicated to Sir Rupert Harborough , to confirm his belief in his wife 's criminality . Indeed , the epistle was neither more nor less than any gentleman might write upon a matter of business to any lady . "
361579	361591	361594	361594	he	903	" said the baronet , throwing the note upon the table , "
361617	361627	361604	361604	I	0	" he continued , in a tone of command . "
361673	361674	361662	361662	his	886	" "
361681	361686	361662	361662	his	886	" murmured Lady Cecilia . "
361693	361698	361699	361699	Chichester	886	" continued the baronet , "
361723	361724	361709	361709	you	1008	" "
361730	361739	361709	361709	you	1008	" ejaculated the lady , now dreadfully excited . "
361747	361756	361757	361757	You	1008	" said Sir Rupert in an imperative manner . "
361804	361805	361792	361792	we	10600	" "
361817	361828	361812	361812	you	10602	" cried Cecilia , bursting into an agony of tears . "
361831	361836	361837	361837	I	0	" ejaculated the baronet : "
361913	361914	361918	361918	you	10602	" "
361933	361955	361918	361918	you	10602	" demanded Lady Cecilia , drying her tears , and endeavouring to compose herself , now that the worst was known . "
361970	361975	361956	361956	I	0	" said Sir Rupert ; "
362009	362010	361999	361999	you	1008	" "
362018	362023	361999	361999	you	1008	" exclaimed the lady , "
362118	362119	362101	362101	your	887	" "
362130	362131	362122	362122	you	1008	" "
362140	362177	362134	362134	you	1008	" interrupted his wife indignantly ; and it was singular to see that adulterous woman — that criminal wife — that profligate female now putting her husband to the blush , by exposing his base designs . "
362183	362188	362134	362134	you	1008	" exclaimed Sir Rupert , "
362212	362213	362197	362197	Greenwood	903	" "

362282	362292	362275	362275	I	0	" said Lady Cecilia , rising from her seat : "
362312	362390	362275	362275	I	0	" Sir Rupert rang the bell and ordered wine to be brought up , while Lady Cecilia hastened to her boudoir to attire herself for going out ; and in the mean time a servant was despatched to procure a cab . The vehicle arrived and Lady Cecilia was already upon the threshold of the front door of the house , when a servant in a handsome livery ascended the steps , presented a letter , and said "
362396	362572	362275	362275	I	0	" Lady Cecilia received the letter ; and the servant who delivered it , immediately took his departure . The lady was about to send in the letter by her own domestic to her husband , when the superscription on the envelope caught her eyes by the light of the hall - lamp . The writing was in the delicate hand of a female ; and , without a moment 's hesitation , Cecilia consigned the epistle to her reticule . She then stepped into the vehicle , and ordered the driver to take her to Spring Gardens . There were two bright lamps fixed in front of the cab ; and by these means was Lady Cecilia enabled to examine the contents of the letter intended for her husband . Without the least hesitation she opened the letter , and to her ineffable surprise discovered that it contained a Bank of England note for one thousand pounds . This treasure was accompanied by a letter , the contents of which were as follows : — "
362636	362746	362618	362619	The individual	8955	" No name — no date — no address were appended to this mysterious note . The writing was in a delicate female hand;—and a servant in a handsome livery had delivered the letter . These circumstances , combined with the handsome manner in which the money was tendered , refuted the suspicion that some female , with whom Sir Rupert was illicitly connected , had thus befriended him . Lady Cecilia was bewildered : the pain of conjecture and doubt was however absorbed in the pleasurable feelings excited by the possession of so large a sum of money . The cab now stopped at Mr. Greenwood 's residence . "
362756	362775	362747	362747	You	10608	" said Mr. Greenwood , as he handed the fair visitant to a seat in his elegant drawing - room,—"you
362790	362791	362747	362747	You	10608	" "
362794	362799	362747	362747	You	10608	" answered Cecilia coldly : "
362815	362816	362810	362811	Sir Rupert	887	" "
362819	362823	362747	362747	You	10608	" cried Greenwood ; "
362832	362833	362747	362747	You	10608	" "
362838	362843	362747	362747	You	10608	" added the lady . "
362864	362865	362846	362847	Sir Rupert	887	" "
362873	362877	362846	362847	Sir Rupert	887	" observed Greenwood . "
362900	362901	362886	362886	his	887	" "
362918	362923	362903	362903	you	0	" said Lady Cecilia . "
362936	362940	362934	362934	he	887	" exclaimed Greenwood . "

362969	362974	362951	362951	he	887	" observed the lady , "
362995	362996	363004	363004	He	887	" "
362999	363003	363004	363004	He	887	" cried Greenwood . "
363014	363015	363016	363016	His	887	" "

363055	363074	363047	363047	I	0	" said Greenwood , who did not treat the business with so much serious attention as Lady Cecilia had anticipated—"I

363151	363177	363178	363178	my	0	" said Lady Cecilia , cruelly hurt by this cold calculation on the part of a man the slave of whose passions she had so completely been,—"for

363205	363209	363203	363203	Cecilia	1008	" observed Greenwood . "
363227	363228	363216	363217	my husband	27376	" "
363241	363245	363216	363217	my husband	27376	" interrupted Greenwood . "
363300	363301	363282	363282	he	27376	" "
363315	363320	363312	363312	my	0	" repeated Lady Cecilia , "
363339	363340	363312	363312	my	0	" "
363379	363380	363369	363369	he	27376	" "
363391	363395	363369	363369	he	27376	" said Cecilia : "
363408	363413	363396	363396	we	10620	" she added ironically . "
363416	363422	363396	363396	we	10620	" exclaimed Greenwood , coolly ; "
363450	363451	363396	363396	we	10620	" "
363466	363471	363459	363459	I	0	" said Lady Cecilia . "
363482	363489	363473	363473	I	0	" returned the Member of Parliament . "
363532	363533	363524	363524	I	0	" "
363537	363544	363524	363524	I	0	" said Lady Cecilia , rising : "
363561	363627	363524	363524	I	0	" The fair patrician lady then took her leave , and returned to her husband , who awaited Greenwood 's decision in a state of the most painful suspense . Cecilia communicated to him the particulars of the interview ; and , ere he retired to rest , the baronet drew up the document which was to save himself by the compromise of his honour . "
363634	363648	363524	363524	I	0	" said Sir Rupert , as he handed the paper to his wife . "
363672	363673	363662	363662	I	0	" "
363676	363680	363662	363662	I	0	" said Cecilia . "
363830	363831	363797	363798	a mistress	10629	" "
363834	363839	363797	363798	a mistress	10629	" answered Lady Cecilia . "
363848	363849	363797	363798	a mistress	10629	" "
363856	363861	363797	363798	a mistress	10629	" returned Sir Rupert . "
363890	364514	363884	363884	I	0	" The baronet set to work , and , in a most business - like manner , wrote out the compact . He then read it to Lady Cecilia , who signified her approval of its terms . A counterpart was written ; and the husband and wife signed the papers that released them from all the moral obligations of their marriage - vows ! They then retired to their separate apartments , better pleased with each other , perhaps , than they had been for a long — long time . The reader need scarcely be informed that Lady Cecilia said nothing to her husband relative to the mysterious letter containing the Bank note for a thousand pounds . On the following morning Lady Cecilia repaired to the abode of Mr. Greenwood . When she arrived in Spring Gardens , she found the street completely blocked up with a train of charity children — boys and girls , marshalled by the parish beadle , and accompanied by the schoolmaster and schoolmistress . The girls were attired in their light blue dresses , plain straw bonnets , white collars , and pepper - and - salt coloured cloaks ; and their arms , red with the cold , were only half covered with their coarse mittens . The boys wore their muffin caps , short coats , and knee - breeches ; and each was embellished with a large tin plate , or species of medal , affixed like a badge of honour , to the breast . Their meagre countenances , their thin arms , and lanky legs , did not speak much in favour of the quantity of food which constituted their diurnal meals . Lady Cecilia was conducted to the drawing - room by the Italian valet , who informed her that Mr. Greenwood would wait upon her the moment he had dismissed the charity children . Lafleur , in the mean time threw open the door of the mansion , and admitted the procession into the spacious hall , after having kept the poor creatures shivering in the cold for nearly a quarter of an hour . The beadle took his station upon the steps , with awful dignity , and watched the boys and girls as they defiled past him in military order into the hall . It was very evident from the timid glances which the little scholars cast towards the countenance of this functionary , that they believed him to be one of the most important personages on the face of the earth ; and perhaps they were even perplexed to decide , in their own minds , whether the parish beadle whom they saw before them , or Mr. Greenwood , M. P. , whom they were about to see , was the greater man of the two . At length the procession had entirely cleared the threshold of the mansion , and then only did the beadle enter . He doffed his enormous cocked hat out of respect to the owner of the dwelling in which he now found himself , and made his long staff ring upon the marble pavement of the hall with a din that electrified the children and called looks of solemn importance to the countenances of the schoolmaster and mistress . In a few moments a side door opened , and Mr. Greenwood appeared . The beadle struck his stick upon the hall floor once more ; and the children , duly tutored to obey the signal , saluted the great man , the girls with low curtseys , and the boys by doffing their muffin caps , bobbing their heads forward , and kicking back their left legs . "
364520	364538	364517	364518	Mr. Muffles	1283	" said the Member of Parliament to the beadle , with one of his usual affable smiles ; "
364546	364547	364551	364551	sir	26649	" "
364553	364579	364582	364582	sir	26649	" responded Muffles in a self - sufficient and important tone , glancing at the same time in a patronising manner upon the groups of juveniles around—"these
364641	364642	364643	364643	I	0	" "
364650	364663	364647	364648	Mr. Muffles	1283	" replied the Member of Parliament , in a most condescending manner , "
364707	364737	364685	364685	I	0	" Mr. Greenwood did not think it necessary to state his knowledge that the whole affair had been got up by Lafleur , in obedience to his own commands . "
364743	364748	364749	364756	an enlightened , independent , and important constituency	10637	" continued Mr. Greenwood , "
364817	364844	364872	364873	This gen'leman	10642	" Mr. Muffles ' stick was here rapped upon the floor with tremendous violence ; and the boys and girls immediately burst forth into shrill cries of "
364849	364871	364872	364873	This gen'leman	10642	" When silence was once more restored , the beadle in due form presented the schoolmaster and schoolmistress to Mr. Greenwood . "
364877	364883	364875	364875	sir	26649	" said the parish functionary , "
364916	364917	364918	364918	Febivary	1285	" "
364923	364933	364920	364921	Mr. Muffles	1283	" said the schoolmaster , mildly correcting the beadle . "
364944	364950	364941	364942	Mr. Twiggs	1284	" exclaimed the parish authority . "
364983	364984	364965	364965	her	1286	" "
364997	365006	364994	364995	Mr. Twiggs	1284	" said Greenwood , bowing to the master : "
365024	365033	365010	365011	Mrs. Twiggs	1286	" he added , bowing to the mistress . "
365042	365054	365035	365035	you	26649	" said Mr. Twiggs , in a meek and fawning tone , "
365067	365068	365035	365035	you	26649	" "
365078	365082	365075	365076	Mr. Twiggs	1284	" returned Greenwood ; "
365100	365156	365075	365076	Mr. Twiggs	1284	" The mere idea of any mention of the parochial school being made in Parliament , produced such an impression upon the beadle that he banged his staff most earnestly on the hall floor ; and the children , taking it for a signal which they had been previously tutored to observe , again yelled forth "
365161	365162	365075	365076	Mr. Twiggs	1284	" "
365165	365176	365075	365076	Mr. Twiggs	1284	" thundered Mr. Muffles ; and the vociferations instantly ceased . "
365182	365196	365075	365076	Mr. Twiggs	1284	" said Mr. Greenwood , addressing the one who stood nearest to him , "
365211	365212	365213	365214	Jem Blister	1287	" "
365218	365224	365216	365216	sir	26649	" was the prompt reply . "
365238	365239	365242	365242	mother	3159	" "
365248	365249	365242	365242	mother	3159	" "
365255	365277	365278	365279	My Godfathers	28510	" ejaculated Mr. Muffles , with a terrific frown : then , by way of prompting the lad , he said , "
365282	365283	365284	365285	My Godfathers	28510	" "
365292	365311	365284	365285	My Godfathers	28510	" hastily cried the boy , catching at the hint ; and after a pause , he added , "
365323	365324	365284	365285	My Godfathers	28510	" "
365334	365340	365327	365327	I	0	" again exclaimed Mr. Twiggs . "
365355	365388	365389	365391	My good boy	10666	" Another urchin stepped forth from the rank , and stood , blushing up to his very hair , and fumbling about with his cap , in the presence of Mr. Greenwood . "
365393	365407	365389	365391	My good boy	10666	" said the Member of Parliament , condescendingly patting him upon the head , "
365413	365414	365410	365410	your	27187	" "
365428	365433	365426	365426	sir	26649	" replied the boy . "
365440	365445	365434	365434	I	0	" said the schoolmaster , "
365455	365456	365451	365451	his	10669	" "
365464	365468	365461	365462	Mr. Twiggs	1284	" exclaimed Greenwood : "
365492	365493	365494	365496	The fust man	10671	" "
365500	365501	365494	365496	The fust man	10671	" "
365513	365514	365515	365518	The fust ' ooman	10674	" "
365522	365523	365515	365518	The fust ' ooman	10674	" "
365528	365533	365515	365518	The fust ' ooman	10674	" repeated Mr. Greenwood . "
365544	365545	365536	365536	me	0	" "
365555	365560	365561	365561	He	10677	" said Mr. Twiggs . "
365567	365568	365561	365561	He	10677	" "
365583	365584	365574	365574	you	26649	" "
365610	365630	365631	365631	Garlick	1289	" The boy was rattling on at a furious pace , when the ominous voice of Mr. Twiggs ejaculated , "
365639	365649	365633	365633	I	0	" And Master Garlick began to cry most piteously . "
365660	365680	365681	365681	he	10677	" said Mr. Greenwood , by way of soothing the discomfited schoolmaster and restoring the abashed beadle to confidence ; "
365695	365795	365796	365796	My	0	" The Member of Parliament then delivered himself of a long harangue in favour of a sound religious education and in praise of virtue ; and thus ended the solemn farce . The great man bowed and withdrew : the beadle rapped his staff upon the floor ; Lafleur opened the door ; and the procession filed slowly out of the mansion . Mr. Greenwood , having thus gone through a ceremony an account of which was to appear in the papers on the following morning , hurried up to the drawing - room where Lady Cecilia awaited him . "
365800	365810	365796	365796	My	0	" he exclaimed , as he entered the room , "
365841	365842	365796	365796	My	0	" "
365851	365873	365796	365796	My	0	" interrupted the baronet 's wife , in a more peremptory tone than Mr. Greenwood had ever yet heard her use . "
365909	366041	366044	366045	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Mr. Greenwood ran his eye over the document , and appeared satisfied . He then drew forth the bill from his pocket - book , and handed it to Lady Cecilia . There was a flush upon the lady 's delicately pale countenance ; and her eyes sparkled with unusual vivacity . She was dressed in a very neat , but plain and simple manner ; and Mr. Greenwood fancied that she had never seemed so interesting before . As he delivered the bill into her keeping , he took her hand and endeavoured to convey it to his lips . She drew back with an air of offended dignity , which would have well become a lady that had never surrendered herself to the pleasures of an illicit love . "
366047	366060	366044	366045	Mr. Greenwood	903	" she said , in a firm , and even haughty tone : "
366128	366129	366124	366124	I	0	" "
366148	366158	366146	366146	Cecilia	1008	" replied Greenwood , with a somewhat supercilious smile ; "
366178	366179	366180	366180	Your	1008	" "
366193	366198	366180	366180	Your	1008	" said Lady Cecilia . "
366211	366216	366201	366201	I	0	" rejoined Greenwood haughtily , "
366227	366228	366231	366231	you	0	" "
366241	366249	366231	366231	you	0	" exclaimed Cecilia , with cutting irony , "
366409	366420	366402	366402	you	903	" Greenwood glanced hastily at the letter , and exclaimed , "
366438	366439	366429	366430	Mrs. Arlington	891	" "
366443	366447	366440	366441	Mrs. Arlington	891	" exclaimed Cecilia : "
366466	366467	366455	366456	that woman	27898	" "
366471	366499	366455	366456	that woman	27898	" said Greenwood , struck by this noble act on the part of the fair one whom he himself had first seduced from the paths of virtue . "
366508	366519	366455	366456	that woman	27898	" observed Cecilia , in a tone of profound contempt , "
366544	367273	366537	366542	the late lover of his wife	10700	" Greenwood only answered with a satirical curl of the lip . Lady Cecilia rose from her seat , bowed coldly to the capitalist , and withdrew . Thus terminated the amours of the man of the world and the lady of fashion — ending , as such illicit loves usually do , in a quarrel . But the reader must not suppose that the same sentiments of pride which had thus induced Lady Cecilia to break off abruptly a connexion which her paramour had been for some time dissolving by degrees , influenced her in the use to which she appropriated the handsome sum supplied for an especial purpose by Mrs. Arlington . The lady knew no compunction in this respect , and she therefore devoted the thousand pounds so generously forwarded by her husband 's late mistress , to her own wants ! * * * * * The Italian valet had overheard the entire conversation between Lady Cecilia Harborough and Mr. Greenwood , which we have just described . In the course of the day the whole details of that interview were communicated to Mrs. Arlington , who thus learnt that Lady Cecilia had intercepted the money intended for Sir Rupert Harborough , and had settled the forged bill without being compelled to disburse it . IT was the 1st of January , 1840 . The tide of Time rolls on with the same unvarying steadiness of motion , wearing off the asperities of barbarism , as the great flood of ocean smooths the sharp edges of rugged rocks . But as the seasons glide away , vainly may we endeavour to throw a veil upon the past;—vainly do we lament , when Winter comes , that our Spring - dreams should be faded and gone , too beautiful to endure;—vainly , vainly do we pray that the waves of a Lethean sea may overwhelm the memories of those years when Time cast flowers from his brow , and diamonds from his wing ! Time looks down upon the world from the heights of the Pyramids of Egypt ; and , as he surveys the myriad cities of the universe swarming with life,—marks the mighty armies of all states , ready to exterminate and kill,—views the navies of great powers riding over every sea,—as he beholds all these . Time chuckles , for he knows that they are his own ! For the day must come when the Pyramids themselves , the all but immortal children of antiquity , shall totter and fall ; and Time shall triumph over even these . The strongest edifices crumble into dust , and the power of the mightiest nations fritters into shreds , beneath the hand of Time . The glories of Sesostris are now a vague dream — the domination of Greece and Rome has become an uncertain vision : the heroes of the Crusades have long since mouldered in the earth;—the crescent of the Ottomans menaces Christendom no more : the armadas of Spain are extinct;—the thrones that Napoleon raised are cast down : of the millions that he led to conquest , during his meteor - like career , what numbers have left this busy scene for ever and how varied are the climes in which they have found their graves ! Oh , Time ! what is there that can strive with thee — thou that art the expression of the infinite existence of God himself ! Alas ! if Time were a spirit endowed with intellect to comprehend , and feelings to sympathise , how would he sorrow over the woes of that human existence , which has now occupied nearly sixty centuries ! Year after year rolls away ; and yet how slowly does civilization accomplish its task of improving the condition of the sons and daughters of toil . For in the present day , as it was in the olden time , the millions labour to support the few ; and the few continue to monopolize the choicest fruits of the earth . The rights of labour are denied ; and the privileges of birth and wealth are dominant . And ever , when the millions , bowed down by cares , and crushed with incessant hardships , raise the voice of anguish to their taskmasters , the cry is , "
367277	367337	366537	366542	the late lover of his wife	10700	" And when the poor labourer , with the sweat standing in large drops upon his brow , points to his half - starved wife and little ones , and demands the increase of his wages which will enable him to feed them adequately , and clothe them comfortably , the only response that meets his ears is still , "
367342	367397	366537	366542	the late lover of his wife	10700	" And when the mechanic , pale and emaciated , droops over his loom , and in a faint tone beseeches that his miserable pittance may be turned into a fair remuneration for that hard and unceasing work which builds up the fortunes of his employer , the answer to his pathetic prayer is , "

367500	368641	366537	366542	the late lover of his wife	10700	" for the millions , while the few repose on downy couches , feed upon the luxuries of the land and water , and move from place to place in sumptuous equipages ! It was the 1st of January , 1840 . Another New Year 's Day — commemorated with feasting by those who had no reason to repine , but marked as the opening of another weary epoch of care and sorrow by those who had nothing for which to be grateful , either to heaven or to man ! The first day of January , 1840 , was inclement and severe . The air was piercing cold , and the rain fell in torrents . The streets of the great metropolis were swept by a wintery wind that chased the poor houseless wanderers beneath the coverings of arches and doorways , and sent the shivering mendicants to implore an asylum at the workhouse . It was evening ; and the lamps diffused but an uncertain light in the great thoroughfares . The courts and alleys of the poor neighbourhoods were enveloped in almost total darkness ; for every shutter was closed , and where there were no shutters , blinds were drawn down , or rags were stretched across the windows , to expel the bitter cold . We must now request our readers to accompany us to a district of London , which is most probably altogether unknown to the aristocrat , even by name , and with which many of that class whose occupations lead them into an intimate acquaintance with the metropolis , are by no means familiar . Situate to the east of Bethnal Green,—bounded on the north by Bonner 's Fields , on the south by the Mile End Road , and on the east by the Regent 's Canal,—and intersected by the line of the Eastern Counties Railway , is an assemblage of narrow streets and filthy lanes , bearing the denomination of Globe Town . When compared with even the worst districts of the metropolis,—when placed in contrast with Saint Giles 's or Saffron Hill,—Globe Town still appears a sink of human misery which civilisation , in its progress , has forgotten to visit . The majority of the streets are unpaved , rugged , and broken . The individual who traverses them in the summer is blinded by the dust , or disgusted by heaps of putrescent offal , the rotting remains of vegetables , and filth of every description , which meet the eye at short intervals ; and , in winter , he wallows , knee - deep , in black mud and stagnant water . But even in the summer itself , and in the very midst of the dog - days , there are swamps of mire in many of the streets of Globe Town , which exhale a nauseating and sickly odour , like that of decomposing dead bodies . In the winter time Globe Town is a complete marsh . Lying low , in the vicinity of the canal , and on a naturally swampy soil , the district is unhealthy in the extreme . Nor do its inhabitants endeavour , by any efforts of their own , to mitigate the consequences of these local disadvantages . They seem , for the most part , to cling with a sort of natural tenacity , to their rags and filth . Perhaps it is the bitterness of their poverty which makes them thus neglectful of the first duties of cleanliness : perhaps their pinching indigence reduces them to a state of despair that allows them no spirit and no heart to do any thing that may conduce to their comfort . Whatever be the cause , it is nevertheless a fact that , with the exception of one or two streets , Globe Town is a district which necessity alone could compel a person of cleanly habits and domestic propriety to reside in . And yet Globe Town contains streets delighting in aristocratic names . There is Grosvenor Place in which a carriage and pair would have some trouble to turn ; there is Parade Street , where a corporal 's guard could not find space to manœuvre ; there is Park Street , whose most gorgeous embellishment is the sign of a mangle ; there is Chester Place , formed by two rows of miserable shops ; and there are Essex Street and Digby Street , where single men may obtain lodgings at the rate of threepence a night . How strange is this affection for fine names to distinguish horrible neighbourhoods ! In the lowest parts of Whitechapel we find Pleasant Row , Queen Street , Flower Street , Duke Street , and Rose Lane . In Bethnal Green , a place inhabited by the poorest of the poor is denominated Silver Street ; and , in the same district , a filthy thoroughfare is christened Pleasant Street . Globe Town and its immediate vicinity abound in cemeteries . To the north there is the Eastern London Cemetery ; and to the south there are two Jews ' burial grounds , and two other places of sepulture . With the exception of the first - mentioned one , which has only been recently opened , and is a large airy space neatly planted with shrubs , those cemeteries are so crowded with the remains of mortality , that it is impossible to drive a spade into the ground without striking against human bones . When you once merge from the Cambridge Road , pass the new church in Bethnal Green , and plunge into Globe Town , it seems as if you had left London altogether,—as if you were no longer within the limits of the metropolis , but had suddenly dropped from the clouds into a strange village strangely peopled . You encounter but few persons in the streets ; and those whom you do meet are , for the most part , squalid , emaciated , pale , and drooping . The only sounds of mirth which meet your ear , emanate from the casements of the public - houses , or from the urchins that play half - naked in the mud . With these exceptions , Globe Town is silent , gloomy , and sombre . The shop - windows are indicative of the poverty of the inhabitants . The butcher 's shed displays but a few slices of liver stretched upon a board , sheep 's heads of no very inviting appearance , and hearts , lungs , and lights , all hanging together , like a Dutch clock with its weights against a wall . The poor make stews of this offal . The fish - stalls present "
368646	368827	366537	366542	the late lover of his wife	10700	" as George Robins would say , nothing but the most coarse and the cheapest articles — such as huge Dutch plaice , haddocks , & c. In the season the itinerant venders of fresh - herrings and sprats drive a good trade in Globe Town . In a word , every thing in that district denotes poverty — poverty — nothing but pinching poverty . The inhabitants of Globe Town are of two kinds ; being weavers , and persons who earn their livelihood by working at the docks or on the canal , on the one hand ; and thieves , prostitutes , and vagrants , on the other . When a burglar or a pickpocket finds St. Giles 's , Clerkenwell , the Mint , or Bethnal Green too hot to hold him , he betakes himself to Globe Town , where he buries himself in some obscure garret until the storms that menaced him be blown over . Globe Town has thus acquired amongst the fraternity of rogues of all classes , the expressive denomination of the "
368831	369562	366537	366542	the late lover of his wife	10700	" In one of the narrowest , dirtiest , and most lonely streets at the eastern extremity of Globe Town , there was a house of an appearance more dilapidated than the rest . It was only two storeys high , and was built in a very singular manner . From the very threshold of the front door a precipitate staircase , more nearly resembling a ladder , led to the upper apartments ; so that when any one entered that house from the street , he had to thread no passage nor corridor , but immediately began to ascend those steep steps . The staircase led to a landing , from which two doors opened into small , dirty , and dark chambers . These rooms had a door of communication pierced in the wall that separated them : but there were no stairs leading down into the lower apartments of the house . The only way of obtaining access to the rooms on the ground - floor , was by means of a door up an alley leading from the street , and running along one side of the house into a court formed by other dwellings . Thus the upper and lower parts of this strange building might be said to constitute two distinct tenements . The windows of the ground - floor rooms were darkened with shutters , at the upper part of which holes in the shape of hearts had been cut to admit a few straggling rays of light . The rooms on the upper floor were furnished in a tolerably comfortable manner ; but every article was wretchedly begrimed with dirt . The front apartment served as a sitting - room for the inmates of this strangely - built house ; and the back chamber was fitted up as a bed - room . It was evening , as we before said ; and thick curtains were drawn over the two windows of the front room to which we have alluded . A candle with a long flaring wick , stood upon the table . On a good fire a kettle was just beginning to boil . The table was set out with glasses , bottles , sugar , lemons , pipes , and tobacco . The inmates of that room were evidently preparing for a carouse , while the rain beat in torrents against the windows , and the wind swept down the street like a hurricane . But who were the inmates of that room ? We will proceed to inform our readers . Lolling in an arm - chair , the covering of which was torn in many places , and spotted all over with grease , was a female , who in reality had scarcely numbered five - and - twenty years , but to whom the ravages of dissipation and evil passions gave the appearance of five - and - thirty . She had once been good - looking ; and her features still retained the traces of beauty : but there was a deep blue tint beneath the eyes , which joined the dark thick brows , and thus seemed to inclose the orbs themselves in a dingy circle . The faded cheeks were coloured with rouge ; but the dye had been so clumsily plastered on , that the effect could not deceive the most ignorant in such matters . This woman wore a faded light silk gown , cut very low in front , and disclosing a considerable portion of a thin and shrivelled neck . In a word , she had the air of being what she really was — a faded courtesan of a low order . Her proper name was Margaret Flathers ; but her acquaintance , for brevity 's sake , called her Meg ; and , in addition to these appellations , the name of The Rattlesnake had been conferred upon her , from the circumstance that she was fond of dressing in silks or satins , which she had a habit of rustling as much as possible when she walked . On the other side of the fire - place was seated a man of cadaverous countenance , which was overshadowed by a quantity of tangled black hair , and whose expression was vile and sinister to a degree .

369664	369703	369662	369662	Meg	1291	" The woman drew two tumblers towards her , and half filled each with gin . She then added sugar and lemon ; and in a few moments the Resurrection Man poured the boiling element upon the liquor . "

370251	370274	370275	370275	you	1291	" continued the Resurrection Man , after a pause , during which he imbibed a considerable quantity of the exhilarating fluid in his glass,—"don't

370714	370742	370711	370712	Richard Markham	874	" exclaimed the Resurrection Man , his countenance suddenly wearing an expression of such concentrated — vile — malignant rage , as to render him perfectly hideous . "
370752	370758	370711	370712	Richard Markham	874	" cried the Rattlesnake hastily ; "

371463	371483	371458	371458	Tony	1061	" said the woman , in a tone more than half interrogatively , and only partially expressing a conviction . "
371490	371511	371458	371458	Tony	1061	" cried the Resurrection Man , brutally ; at the same time eyeing his mistress in a somewhat suspicious manner . "
371527	371538	371525	371525	Tony	1061	" returned the Rattlesnake , affecting a tone of indifference . "

371566	371577	371578	371578	you	1291	" exclaimed Tidkins , striking his fist upon the table , "

371793	371799	371789	371789	yourself	1061	" returned the Resurrection Man . "

371902	371912	371893	371893	anybody	27236	" said the Rattlesnake in a tone of alarm . "
371920	371926	371893	371893	anybody	27236	" added the Resurrection Man ; "
371957	371958	371959	371959	Tony	1061	" "
371961	371973	371959	371959	Tony	1061	" exclaimed the woman , a deadly pallor overspreading her countenance , "
371992	371993	371974	371974	you	1061	" "
372012	372019	371994	371994	I	0	" interrupted the Resurrection Man coolly . "
372072	372337	372349	372349	Jack	1127	" At this moment a knock at the street door was heard . The Rattlesnake hastened to answer the summons , and returned accompanied by the Buffer and his wife . THE Buffer was one of the most unmitigated villains that ever disgraced the name of man . There was no species of crime with which he was not familiar ; and he had a suitable helpmate in his wife , who was the sister of Dick Flairer — a character that disappeared from the stage of life in the early part of this history . In person , the Buffer was slight , short , and rather well - made,—extremely active , and endowed with great physical power . His countenance was by no means an index to his mind ; for it was inexpressive , stolid , and vacant . His wife was a woman of about five - and - twenty , being probably ten years younger than her husband . She was not precisely ugly ; but her countenance — the very reverse of that of the Buffer — was so indicative of every evil passion that can possibly disgrace womanhood , as to be almost repulsive . The two new - comers seated themselves near the fire , for their clothes were dripping with the rain , which continued to pour in torrents . The warmth of the apartment and a couple of glasses of smoking grog soon , however , put them into good humour and made them comfortable ; and the Resurrection Man then proposed that they should "

372378	372383	372384	372384	He	874	" was the answer . "
372387	372405	372406	372406	you	1127	" exclaimed the Resurrection Man , as if the news were almost too good to be true : "

373717	373727	373711	373713	The old fellow	3255	" she added , after a moment 's pause . "

374050	374242	374259	374261	the Resurrection Man	952	" Just to show that if I was deceived , you was too . But it 's always the way with you : when any thing turns out wrong , you throw the blame on me . Did n't you say to me , when the old fellow was took ill a month ago : ' Moll , ' says you , ' go and offer your services to nurse the old gentleman ; and may be if he dies he 'll leave you something ; or at all events you may worm out of him the secret of where he keeps his money , and we can get hold of it all the same . ' That 's what you said — and so I did go and nurse the old man ; and he seemed very grateful , for at last he began to like me almost as much as he did his snuff - box — and that 's saying a great deal , considering the quantity of snuff he used to take , and the good it seemed to do him when he was low and melancholy . "
374243	374257	374259	374261	the Resurrection Man	952	" Well — what 's the use of you and the Buffer wrangling ? "
374263	374274	374259	374261	the Resurrection Man	952	" Tell us all about the old fellow 's death . "
374275	374283	374285	374285	Moll	1264	" As I was saying just now , "
374287	374508	374285	374285	Moll	1264	" the old gentleman was took wery bad this morning soon after Jack left to go up to Holloway ; and the landlady , Mrs. Smith , insisted on sending for a doctor . The old gentleman shook his head , when he heard Mrs. Smith say so , and seemed wery , much annoyed at the idea of having a medical visit . But Mrs. Smith was positive , for she said that she had lost her husband and been left a lone widder through not having a doctor in time to him when he was ill . Well , a doctor was sent for , and he said that the old gentleman was very bad indeed . He asked me and Mrs. Smith what his name was , and whether he 'd any relations , as they ought to be sent for ; but Mrs. Smith said that she never knowed his name at all , and as for relations no one never come to see him and he never went to see no one his - self . The doctors orders him to have mustard poultices put to his feet ; but it was n't of no use , for the old fellow gives a last gasp and dies at twenty minutes past two this blessed afternoon . "
374509	374512	374514	374516	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Well , "
374518	374533	374514	374516	the Resurrection Man	3220	" and then , I suppose , you had a rummage in his boxes ? "
374534	374539	374541	374541	Moll	1264	" Boxes , indeed ! "
374551	374626	374548	374548	her	1264	" Why , when he first come to the house , Mrs. Smith says that all he had was a bundle tied up in a blue cotton pocket handkercher — a couple of shirts , and a few pair of stockings , or so . She did n't like to take him in , she says ; but he offered to pay a month 's rent in advance ; and so she was satisfied . "
374627	374635	374637	374638	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Then you found nothing at all ? "
374640	374644	374646	374646	Moll	1264	" Not much , "
374648	374944	374646	374646	Moll	1264	" The moment we saw he was dead , we began to search all over the room , to see what he had left behind him . For a long time we could find nothing but a dirty shirt , two pair of stockings , and a jar of snuff ; and yet Mrs. Smith said she knew there must be money , for she had heard him counting his gold one day before he was took ill . Besides , during his illness , whenever money was wanted to get any thing for him , he never gave it at first , but sent me or Mrs. Smith out of the room with some excuse ; and when we went back , he always had the money in his hand . Well , me and Mrs. Smith searched and searched away ; and at last Mrs. Smith bethinks herself of looking behind the bed . We moved the bed away from the wall as well as we could , for the dead body lying upon it made it precious heavy ; and then we saw that a hole had been made down in the comer of the room . Mrs. Smith puts in her finger , and draws out an old greasy silk purse . I heard the gold chink ; but I saw that the purse was not over heavy . ' Well , ' says Mrs. Smith , ' I 'm glad I 've got a witness of what the poor gentleman left behind him , or else I might get into trouble some day or another , if any inquiries should be made . ' So she pours out the gold into her hand , and counts thirty - nine sovereigns . "
374945	374951	374953	374955	the Resurrection Man	952	" And that was all ? "
374957	374961	374963	374964	the Buffer	29668	" Every farthing , "
374968	375073	375085	375086	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Well , I asked Mrs Smith what she intended to do with it ; and she says , ' I shall bury the poor old gentleman decently : that will be five pounds . Then there is a pound for the doctor , as I must get him to follow the funeral ; and here is two pounds for you for your attention to the old gentleman in his illness . ' So she gives me the two pounds ; and I asks her what she is going to do with the rest , because there was still thirty - one pounds left . "
375074	375083	375085	375086	the Rattlesnake	1292	" And what did she say to that ? "
375088	375122	375085	375086	the Rattlesnake	1292	" She began a long ditty about her being an honest woman , though a poor one , and that dead man 's gold would only bring ill - luck into her house . "
375123	375128	375130	375132	the Resurrection Man	3220	" The old fool ! "
375134	375165	375130	375132	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And then she said she should ask the parson , when she had buried the old man , what she ought to do with the thirty - one pounds . "
375166	375183	375185	375187	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Why did n't you propose to split it between you , and hold your tongues ? "
375189	375194	375196	375196	Moll	1264	" So I did , "
375198	375239	375196	375196	Moll	1264	" and what do you think the old fool said ? She up and told me that she always thought that me and my husband was not the most respectablest of characters , and she now felt convinced of it . "
375240	375256	375258	375260	the Resurrection Man	952	" Well , we must have those thirty - one yellow boys , old fellow , "
375265	375274	375276	375277	the latter	2065	" Yea — if we can get them , "
375279	375298	375276	375277	the latter	2065	" and I know of no way to do it but to cut the old woman 's throat . "
375299	375307	375196	375196	Moll	1264	" No — that wo n't do , "
375313	375363	375383	375384	the Buffer	29668	" If the old woman disappeared suddenly , suspicion would be sure to fall on you ; and the whole Happy Valley would be up in arms . Then the blue - bottles might find a trace to this crib here ; and we should all get into trouble . "
375364	375381	375383	375384	the Buffer	29668	" But if you mean to put the kyebosh upon young Markham to - morrow night , "
375386	375400	375383	375384	the Buffer	29668	" wo n't that raise a devil of a dust in the neighbourhood ? "
375401	375417	375419	375421	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Markham disappears from Holloway , which is a long way from the Happy Valley , "
375423	375443	375445	375446	the Buffer	29668	" And the old butler , who is certain to know that the appointment was made for Twig Folly , "
375448	375468	375445	375446	the Buffer	29668	" wo n't he give information that will raise the whole Valley in arms , as you call it ? "
375469	375474	375476	375478	the Resurrection Man	3220	" No such thing , "
375480	375519	375476	375478	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Markham falls into the canal accidentally , and is drowned . There 's no mark of violence on his body , and his watch and money are safe about his person . Now do you understand me ? "
375520	375573	375445	375446	the Buffer	29668	" I understand that if you mean me to jump into the canal and help to hold him in it till he 's drowned , you 're deucedly out in your reckoning , for I ai n't going to risk drowning myself , 'cause I ca n't swim better than a stone . "
375574	375584	375586	375588	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You need not set foot in the water , "
375593	375610	375586	375588	the Resurrection Man	3220	" But I suppose you could hold him by the heels fast enough upon the bank ? "
375611	375622	375624	375625	the Buffer	29668	" Oh ! yes — I do n't mind that , "
375627	375651	375624	375625	the Buffer	29668	" but how shall we get the thirty - one couters from this old fool of a landlady , unless we use violence ? "
375760	375778	375746	375746	his	3220	" Do you know whether the old woman has spoken to any one yet about the funeral ? "
375779	375803	375746	375746	his	3220	" She said she should let it be till to - morrow morning , because the weather was so awful bad this afternoon . "
375804	375807	375809	375811	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Excellent ! "
375813	375843	375844	375845	The woman	27628	" Now , Moll , do you put on your bonnet , take the large cotton umbrella there , and go and do what I tell you without delay . "
375895	375949	375884	375884	he	3220	" Go down as fast as your legs will carry you to Banks , the undertaker , in Globe Lane , and ask to see him . Give him this ; but mind and deliver it into his hand only . If he is not at home , wait till he comes in . "
375966	375974	375976	375977	the Buffer	29668	" What 's in the wind now ? "
375990	375995	375997	375999	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You shall see , "
376001	376018	375997	375999	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Now let us fill our glasses , and blow a cloud till Moll comes back . "
376035	376043	376045	376046	the Buffer	29668	" How the rain does beat down , "
376052	376062	376064	376066	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And the wind sweeps along like a hurricane , "
376068	376095	376064	376066	the Resurrection Man	3220	" By the by , this is New Year 's Day . What different weather it is from what it was last New Year 's Day . "
376096	376112	376114	376115	the Buffer	29668	" Do you recollect what sort of weather it was last New Year 's Day ? "
376117	376121	376123	376125	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Perfectly well , "
376127	376148	376123	376125	the Resurrection Man	3220	" because it was on that evening that I and the poor Cracksman helped young Holford over the Palace wall . "
376149	376162	376164	376165	the Buffer	29668	" And that venture turned out no go , did n't it ? "
376167	376221	376164	376165	the Buffer	29668	" It failed because the young scamp either turned funky or played us false , I never could make out which . But I have an account to settle with him too ; and the first time I meet him I 'll teach him what it is to humbug a man like me . "
376268	376278	376280	376281	the Buffer	29668	" Come , sing as a song , Meg , "
376292	376304	376306	376307	the woman	27628	" I have got a cold , and ca n't sing , "
376309	376316	376318	376319	the Buffer	1077	" Well , then , Tony , "
376321	376338	376318	376319	the Buffer	1077	" tell us some of your adventures . They 'll amuse us till Moll comes back . "
376339	376354	376356	376358	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I am quite tired of telling the same things over and over again , "
376360	376387	376356	376358	the Resurrection Man	3220	" We 've never heard you practise in that line yet ; so the sooner you begin the better . Come , tell us your history . "
376388	376396	376398	376399	the Buffer	29668	" There is n't much to tell , "
376405	376418	376398	376399	the Buffer	29668	" but such as it is , you 're welcome to it . "
376467	376496	376497	376497	My	0	" You are well aware that my name is really John Wicks , although very few of my pals know me by any other title than the Buffer . "
376571	376896	376548	376548	they	10905	" When I was twelve years old , I began to carry out small quantities of coals and potatoes to the customers . We used to supply a great many of the prisoners in the Bench ; and whenever I went into that place , I generally managed to have a game of marbles , and sometimes rackets , with the young blackguards that lurked about the prison to pick up the racket balls , run on messages , and so on . At length I got to play for money ; and as I generally lost , I had to take the money which I received from the customers to pay my little gambling debts . I was obliged to tell my father and mother all kinds of falsehoods to account for the disappearance of the money . Sometimes I said that I had lost a few halfpence ; then I declared that a beggar in the street had snatched a sixpence out of my hand , and ran away ; or else I swore that the customers had not paid me . This last excuse led to serious misunderstandings ; for sometimes my father went himself to collect the debts owing to him ; and then , when the prisoners declared they had paid me , I stuck out that it was false ; and my father called them rogues and swindlers . At length , he began seriously to suspect that his son was robbing him ; and one day he found it out in a manner which I could not deny . I was then fourteen , and was pretty well hardened , I can tell you . So I turned round , and told my father that he had brought it all on himself , because he had instructed me how to cheat the customers in weight and measure , and had therefore brought me up in wrong principles . "
377298	377472	377481	377481	my	0	" My father had thirty barrows , which he let out to the costermongers at the rate of eighteen pence a day each ; and some of those men could clear eight or ten shillings a day by their traffic . But they are so addicted to drinking that they spend all they get ; and in the winter season they starve . Now and then a costermonger would disappear with the barrow , for the loan of which my father never required any security , as the poor souls had none to give ; and then my father offered a reward for the apprehension of the absentee . He was generally caught , and my father always had him taken before the magistrate and punished — as a warning , he said , to the rest . I used to think he behaved very harshly in this respect , as the poor wretch whom he thus got sent to the treadmill had most probably paid for the barrow over and over again . "
377899	378084	378085	378097	One of the persons who frequented the public - house in Suffolk Street	10943	" I now come to more interesting matters . I had been with my master about six years , and was then going on for twenty - one , when my father died . My mother sent for me home to help her in the business ; and I now had the command of money . The taste for gambling which I had imbibed in my boyhood , returned with additional force ; and I sought every opportunity of gratifying my inclination in this respect . I frequented a notorious public - house in Suffolk Street , where gaming was carried on to a great extent ; and my ill - luck seemed unvaried . My mother did all she could to check the progress of this infatuation ; but it was invincible ; and in the course of three years I had completely ruined both my mother and myself . An execution was put into the house for rent , and my mother died of a broken heart . I shed a few tears , and then looked round me for some occupation . "
378521	378738	378739	378739	I	0	" In this situation I remained for three years . The master was very good to us , and gave us a present every time he effected large sales by our means . One afternoon an elderly gentleman entered the mart , and stood bidding for some cut decanters . They had been invoiced to the proprietor of the establishment for six shillings , and the lowest price at which they were to be knocked down was two pounds ten . The bidding was rather slow ; and I retreated a pace or two behind the old gentleman , to avoid having the appearance of being anxious to make myself conspicuous . In that position I observed the corner of a red pocket - book peeping out of his coat tail . I glanced around : no one noticed me ; and in a moment I abstracted the inviting object . This was the first theft I ever committed ; and bad as I already was , the moment I had that pocket - book safe in my possession , I would have given the world for it to have been back again in its former place . The deed was however done ; and I evaporated from the auction mart with the rapidity of thought . "
379041	379271	379025	379025	he	2001	" I thankfully accepted his proposal ; and he led me into Field Lane . There he entered a shop where they sold salt fish , herrings , haddocks , and oysters . He asked a dirty - looking girl if Israel Moses was at home ; and , receiving an affirmative answer , led the way up a narrow , dark , and dirty staircase , to a room where an old Jew , with a face almost completely concealed by grisly white hair , was sitting at a table covered with papers . My guide immediately communicated to him the object of my visit ; and the old Jew questioned me closely relative to the way in which I had obtained the Bank notes . My companion advised me to tell him the exact truth , which I did ; and the Jew then offered me six hundred pounds in gold for my eight hundred pounds ' worth of notes . He explained to me that he should be compelled to send them to his agents in Paris , Hamburgh , and Amsterdam , to get rid of them ; and that he could therefore afford to give me no more . I accepted his proposal , received the gold , and departed , accompanied by my new friend , who was no other than Dick Flairer . "
379609	379972	379605	379605	Mary	1264	" We went down to Canterbury , and took lodgings on the Herne Bay road , close by the barracks . Dick and I used to visit all the neighbouring towns , and see what we could pick up ; but we led a jovial life , spending much more than we got , and thus making desperate inroads into my funds . My old habits of gambling returned ; and the gold which I had received from the Jew was disappearing very rapidly . We had left London for upwards of eight months , when we thought of returning to our old haunts . Mary seemed quite averse to the proposal , and was most anxious to remain a short time longer where she was . To this Dick agreed ; and he and I came up to town . We went to the Boozing - ken on Saffron Hill , and there took up our quarters . Dick introduced me to Bill Bolter ; and as it happened that our funds were all low , we resolved upon adopting some means to replenish our purses . Happening to take up the Times , I saw an advertisement , according to which a wealthy jeweller and goldsmith in the Strand required a porter . I made a remark which led Dick Flairer to observe , that if I chose to take the situation , he could get me a reference , as he knew one of the largest linen - drapers in Norton Folgate , who was in the habit of buying stolen goods of the cracksmen of Dick 's gang , and would not dare refuse to perform the part required . The plan was settled : I applied for the situation , gave the reference , and in two days entered the service of the rich goldsmith . In less than a fortnight I had obtained all the information I required ; and stepping out one evening , I hastened to the boozing - ken , where I met the pals , and appointed the following night for the enterprise . I then returned to my master 's residence . "
380526	380649	380650	380650	We	11022	" We were greatly grieved to think that our enterprise in the jeweller 's house should have failed , and that we had lost so excellent a fellow as Flairer ; but in the midst of our lamentations , the door opened and Dick himself entered the room . Pale , dripping , and exhausted , he fell upon a seat , and would most probably have fainted — if not died — had we not forced some brandy down his throat . He then revived ; and , having changed his clothes , was soon completely recovered from the effects of his bath , and the desperate exertions he had made to swim to a wharf communicating with the Commercial Road . "
380857	381050	380852	380852	Dick	872	" When we arrived there , after an absence of two months , we made a most unpleasant discovery — unpleasant to Dick as the brother , and to me who was enamoured of Mary . She was in a way to become a mother ; her situation was too palpable to be concealed . Dick flew into a most ungovernable rage ; and Mary tried to deny it . But the fact was glaring , and she was obliged to confess that she had been seduced by a serjeant of the regiment stationed at Canterbury . Her attachment to that man , and the hope that he would do her justice , were the reasons that had induced her to remain at Canterbury , when we went to London . The serjeant had recently treated her with neglect and indifference , and she longed for revenge . Dick and I swore that she should have it . She told us that the serjeant was very fond of angling , and that every morning early he indulged in his favourite sport in the river Stour , which flowed close by the barracks . "
381225	381531	381210	381210	He	3924	" The hour drew nigh , and Mary went to the place agreed upon . Dick and I followed her at a little distance . The night was dark ; it was in the month of April ; and the air was very cold . As we drew near the bridge as noiselessly as we could , we distinguished the forms of two persons standing upon the bridge , and leaning in earnest conversation upon the low railing that overhung the huge wheel which was revolving beneath , the torrent pouring over it through the sluices of the dam upon the top of which the bridge stood . We advanced closer ; and could then perceive that the two forms were those of Mary and her seducer . We proceeded to the bridge . When we reached the middle , Dick went up to the serjeant , and said , ' This is my sister ; do you mean to do her justice?'—'No , ' cried Mary ; ' he has just told me that I need have no hope in that respect . ' ' Then there is nothing more to be said , ' exclaimed Dick Flairer ; and at the same moment we precipitated ourselves upon the serjeant . Dick Flairer pressed his hand upon his mouth ; the poor wretch struggled violently ; but in an instant we hurled him over the bridge - railing . He fell upon the wheel ; the roar of the torrent , and the din of the ponderous machine drowned his last cry of agony , and the crushing of his bones . ' Now , Mary , ' said I , ' you are revenged . ' She pressed my hand convulsively , without uttering a word ; and we returned to our lodgings . "
381639	381919	381923	381923	I	0	" The moment the verdict was returned , and we saw that no suspicion attached to any body in reference to the murder , we left Canterbury , and repaired to London . In the course of a few weeks , Mary became the mother of a still - born child ; and in due time I assured her that I would overlook her fault , and marry her if she would have me . She was pleased with the proposal ; and Dick readily agreed to it . But before we could be spliced , I one day met the goldsmith of the Strand in the street ; and he gave me into custody . I was taken before the magistrates , and fully committed for an attempt to rob my employer . While I was in Newgate , waiting for my trial , I was greatly alarmed lest the old gentleman , whom I had robbed at the auction mart , should prefer an indictment against me ; but my fears in this respect were unfounded . At length the sessions commenced , and I was put upon my trial . The Sheriffs had supplied me with counsel , for I was completely without funds when I was arrested . The barrister thus retained in my behalf , advised me to plead guilty , as I should then stand a good chance of escaping transportation . I followed his recommendation , and expressed my contrition for the offence . The Recorder read me a long lecture , and condemned me to seven years ' transportation , which sentence was commuted to two years ' imprisonment in Newgate . "
382336	382495	382505	382505	their	11069	" I often thought , when I was in prison , that if there was a workshop , established by the government to receive persons whom the criminal gaols daily vomit back upon society , many a miserable creature would in reality reform , and be saved from a re - plunge into the sea of crime . But all that the government does is to punish . I mentioned these thoughts to the chaplain . And what did he say ? He endeavoured to get rid of the necessity of giving a decisive opinion , by throwing himself headlong into a mass of argument and reasoning , half religious and half political , which I could not understand . Thus do those men invariably extricate themselves from perplexing topics . In my opinion there is no mockery more abominable — no hypocrisy more contemptible — no morality more baseless than the attributes of a gaol - chaplain ! "
382595	382704	382561	382561	he	4914	" It does not do for me to hold forth in this manner ; I know that : but I can not help expressing the thoughts that occupied me when I was in Newgate . They are often present in my memory ; and , sometimes , when I am dull and in low spirits , I console myself by the conviction that if I am bad now , it is because there is no door open for me to be good . So a truce to these ideas . They do not often come from my lips ; and even now I scarcely wish to recall them . "
382815	382895	382910	382911	The porter	2789	" Suddenly a thought struck me . I would go to the workhouse . The idea consoled me ; and , fearful lest my good intentions should grow cool , I turned back past the door of Newgate again , and directed my steps down the Old Bailey towards Blackfriars ' Bridge . In the course of an hour , I knocked at the door of the — — Workhouse , with an order for admission from the overseer . "
383078	383180	383181	383181	We	11090	" So you see that we had only five ounces of cooked meat and five ounces of bacon , in the shape of animal food , in the course of each week ! And yet we had to work — to keep the grounds in order , to do various jobs in the establishment , and to pick four pounds of oakum each , every day , the Sabbath excepted . Felons are better off;[79 ] for in the prison one has more meat , more bread , and more gruel ( which is certainly nourishing ) than in the workhouse ! "
383257	383430	383219	383223	the able - bodied men	11086	" We were divided into messes , or tables of ten each ; and each mess elected a carver . The duty of the carver was to go to the kitchen and fetch the provision allotted to the individuals at his particular table , and then to distribute it in equal proportions . What fighting and wrangling always took place at meal times ! On meat days , one had too much fat , and another 's morsel was too under - done:—on bacon days , one had too much lean , and another had the rind given to him . Then one declared that he had been cheated out of a potatoe ; and so on . It was a scene of perpetual selfishness — of human beings quarrelling for a crumb ! But who can wonder ? A potatoe or a cubic inch of bread was a considerable portion of a meal ; and where all were ravenous , who could afford to lose even a potatoe or a crumb?[80 ] "
383523	383662	383663	383663	I	0	" But that is no business of mine — and I care nothing for politics of any kind . Of an evening , we used to gather round the fire till bed - time , and talk of our past lives . Many — many of my companions , had , like myself , seen better days ; and it actually made one 's heart ache to hear them compare their former positions with their present ones . And after all , what can be more inhuman — what more cruel , than the very principles of the workhouse system ? Old couples , who have lived together for years and years , are separated when they go to the workhouse . Mothers are debarred from the society of their little ones:—no ties of kindred are respected there ! "

We must observe that we have taken the liberty of altering and improving the language , in which the Buffer delivered his autobiography , to the utmost of our power : we have moreover embodied his crude ideas and reduced his random observations into a tangible shape . We should add that the man was not deficient in intellectual sharpness , in spite of the stolid expression of his countenance ; and thus the observations which he made relative to prison discipline and the neglect of government to adopt means of preventing crime in preference to punishing it when committed , need excite no astonishment in those who peruse them . But to return to the thread of our narrative . When the Buffer 's wife had taken a warm seat by the fire , and comforted herself with a tolerably profound libation of steaming gin - and - water , she proceeded to give an account of her mission .

385224	385447	385448	385448	I	0	" once more interrupted the terrible Resurrection Man , with a sinister lowering of his countenance which checked the reply that was rising to the lips of his companion . The Rattlesnake lighted a candle , and passed into the adjoining apartment . The Resurrection Man poured some raw spirits into a wine glass , tossed it off , and putting on his hat , left the room . He descended the precipitate staircase leading to the front door of the house , and in another moment reached the street . Simply closing , without locking , the door behind him , he turned sharply round into the dark alley which ran beneath a sombre and narrow arch , along one side of the house . But his footsteps , on this occasion , were closely followed by the Rattlesnake . Unable to restrain her curiosity any longer — and , perhaps , influenced by other motives of a less superficial nature,—Margaret Flathers had determined to follow her paramour this night ; and , scarcely had he closed the street door , when she was already at the bottom of the staircase . The moment she stepped into the street , she saw the dark form of the Resurrection Man turn down the alley above mentioned ; and she muttered to herself , "
385476	387187	385460	385460	he	11148	" The Resurrection Man passed half - way up the alley , and taking a key from his pocket , proceeded to open a door that communicated with the ground - floor of his singularly - built house . He entered , and the Rattlesnake hurried up to the door . She applied her ear to the key - hole — listened — and heard his footsteps echoing upon the boarded floor of the back - room . In a few moments the grating of a lucifer - match upon the wall met her ear ; and applying her eye for a moment to the key - hole , she saw that there was now a light within . Impelled by an invincible curiosity , or other motives of a powerful nature,—if not both,—the Rattlesnake cautiously raised the latch , and opened the door to the distance of nearly a foot . With the utmost care , she now ventured to look into the interior of that part of the house , in respect to which a species of Blue - beard restriction had existed for her ever since she first became the companion of the Resurrection Man in that mysterious abode . Glancing cautiously in , we say , she saw a small passage communicating with two rooms — one at each end , front and back . The door of the front room was closed : that of the back one was open . She accordingly directed all her attention to the back - room . Against the wall facing the door was a candle , burning in a bright tin shade or reflector ; and in the middle of the room , between the door and the light , stood the Resurrection Man . He had his back towards the Rattlesnake ; but she could watch all his proceedings with the greatest facility . And how strange were those proceedings!—The Resurrection Man enveloped himself in a large dark cloak , and fixed a black cloth mask over his countenance . He then advanced towards a cupboard , which he opened , and whence he took several articles , the precise nature of which the Rattlesnake could not ascertain , in consequence of the position in which her paramour was then standing . She however observed that he placed those articles in a basket at his feet ; and when this task was accomplished , he lifted the basket in his hand , and turned so abruptly round to leave the room , that the Rattlesnake trembled from head to foot lest he should have caught a glimpse of her head protruded through the opening of the door . She drew herself back and pulled the door towards her . For a moment she felt inclined to beat a precipitate retreat to her own quarters ; but curiosity compelled her to remain . What could mean that strange disguise?—Why that cloak?—Wherefore that mask?—And what were the objects which the Resurrection Man had consigned to his basket?—Lastly , whither was he going ? With the most extreme caution she again pushed the door partly open , and again did she glance into the interior of that mysterious division of the house . But all was now dark ; the light had disappeared , or was extinguished , and the place was involved in total obscurity . Nevertheless , all was not silent . The measured tread of receding footsteps fell upon the woman 's ear : those sounds seemed to come from heavy feet descending stone stairs . Fainter and fainter became the sounds , until at length they merged into the low wind , which whistled gloomily and monotonously through the lower part of the house . Margaret Flathers felt alarmed : she scarcely knew why . Was it that being aware of the diabolical character of the Resurrection Man , she naturally associated his present strange proceedings with some deed of darkness whose very mystery made her shudder ? Was it that she trembled at the idea of being in the power of a miscreant whose ability to work evil seemed as unbounded as his inclination ? Suddenly her thoughts received an interruption which was by no means calculated to tranquillize her mind . A scream , apparently coming from the very bowels of the earth , echoed through the lower part of that house — a scream expressive of an agony so intense , an anguish so acute , that it smote even her hardened and ruthless heart ! That scream was not repeated ; but its echoes rang long throughout the place , and vibrated in a strange and terrible manner on the ears of the Rattlesnake . Then followed low mutterings , in a hoarse and subdued tone ; but as they gradually grew louder , she could recognise the menacing voice of the Resurrection Man . Fear now completely triumphed over the motives which had induced the woman to seek to penetrate into the secrets of her paramour . The dark cloak — the black mask — the basket — the piercing scream — and the threatening voice , all combined to bewilder her imagination , and fill her with vague but not less terrible alarms . Hastily closing the door , she retreated with precipitate speed from the dark alley , and ascended the steep staircase leading to the upper rooms of the house . To throw off her clothes and betake herself to rest was the occupation of but a few minutes : nevertheless , as she laid aside her garments , she cast timid and furtive glances behind her — as if she were afraid that her eyes would encounter some horrible spectre — or some masked figure of appalling aspect . In a quarter of an hour after she had returned from the contemplation of those mysterious proceedings that had filled her mind with such ineffable horror , the Resurrection Man entered the bed - room . A light was burning upon the table , and when the door opened the Rattlesnake glanced with profound terror in that direction — for she feared lest he should appear in his long dark cloak and black mask . She was inured to crime;—but it was that crime which she could contemplate face to face ; and thus the idea that she was in a house where deeds of unknown horror and machinations of an undefined degree of blackness were the business of the terrible man with whom her fortunes were now linked , prostrated all her courage , and filled her with alarms the more profound , because so ominously vague . In order to avoid the risk of betraying her trepidation to the Resurrection Man , she soon affected to fall asleep ; and , when at length slumber really overtook her , her dreams were filled with gaunt forms clad in long black cloaks , and wearing upon their countenances dark masks , through the holes of which their eyes glared with fearful brightness . THE cold January morning struggled into existence , amidst rain and sleet , and seemed cradled in dense masses of clouds of tempestuous blackness . It appeared as if the sun had taken leave of the earth for ever ; and it would not have been surprising had the ignorant inquired whence came the gloomy light that just seemed to guide them to their toil . Miserable indeed was the aspect of the eastern district of the metropolis . Emaciated women , wrapt in thin and scanty shawls , crept along the streets , through the pouring rain , to purchase at the chandlers ' shops the morsel that was to serve for the morning 's meal,—or , perhaps , to pledge some trifling article in their way , ere they could obtain that meal ! Half - starved men,—poor wretches who never made a hearty meal , and who were yet compelled to work like horses,—unhappy beings , who flew to the public houses in despair , and then were reproached by the illiberal and intolerant for their immorality,—black sheep of Fortune 's flock , to whom verdant pastures were unknown,—friendless outcasts , who in sickness knew no other consolation than that of the hospital , and in destitution , no asylum save the workhouse,—luckless mortals , who cursed the day they knew the power of love , and execrated that on which they pronounced the marriage vows , because therefrom had sprung children who pined for want before their face,—such men as these were seen dragging themselves along to their labours on the railroad , the canal , or at the docks . It was about eight o'clock on this miserable morning , when a man , dressed in a shabby suit of black , and wearing a very dirty white neckcloth , the long ends of which hung , damp and lanky , over the front of his closely - buttoned body - coat , walked slowly along Smart Street — a thoroughfare in the eastern part of Globe Town . This individual was in reality verging upon sixty ; but as he dyed his hair and whiskers in order to maintain an uniform aspect of funereal solemnity , he looked ten years younger . His manner was grave and important ; and , although the rain was descending in torrents , he would not for the world depart from that measured pace which was habitual to him . He held an old umbrella above his head , to protect a battered hat , round which a piece of crape was sewn in three or four clumsy folds ; but the torrent penetrated through the cotton tegument , and two streams poured from the broad brims of his hat adown his anti - laughter - looking and rigidly demure countenance . When he arrived at about the middle of Smart Street , he halted , examined the numbers of the houses , and at length knocked at the door of one of them . An elderly woman , dressed in a neat but very homely garb , responded to the summons . "
387196	387203	387189	387190	Mrs. Smith	975	" demanded the individual in black . "
387211	387216	387207	387207	Smith	975	" answered the widow . "
387233	387255	387258	387258	ma'am	26745	please;"—and the stranger stepped into the passage . Mrs. Smith conducted him into her little parlour , and inquired his business . "
387260	387265	387258	387258	ma'am	26745	" was the answer , "
387282	387305	387280	387280	ma'am	26745	" continued the stranger , casting his eyes upwards in a most dolorous manner , and taking a dirty white handkerchief from his pocket,—"alas
387319	387320	387311	387311	you	26745	" "
387331	387365	387326	387326	sir	26649	" said Mrs. Smith , somewhat surprised at the display of sorrow which she now beheld , and very naturally expecting that her visitor would prove to be a relation of the deceased . "
387375	387401	387368	387368	ma'am	26745	" exclaimed the stranger , with a mournful shake of the head , and a truly pitiful turning up of the whites of his eyes : "
387430	387431	387435	387435	sir	26649	" "
387437	387474	387435	387435	sir	26649	" said the good woman , putting the corner of her apron to her eyes ; for the reflection of the stranger called to her mind the loss she had experienced in the deceased Mr. Smith . "
387484	387507	387482	387482	ma'am	26745	" continued the stranger , applying his handkerchief to his face , to suppress , as the widow thought , a sob : "
387542	387543	387544	387544	I	0	" "
387554	387578	387544	387544	I	0	" said Mrs. Smith , wondering when the gentleman would announce the precise terms of relationship in which he stood to the deceased . "
387585	387586	387582	387582	I	0	" "
387598	387628	387591	387591	you	26745	" said the stranger , with another solemn shake of his head — in consequence of which a great deal of wet was thrown over Mrs. Smith 's furniture ; "
387671	387682	387636	387637	Mrs. Smith	975	" here the stranger shook his head again , and groaned audibly—"was
387698	387746	387747	387749	My dear madam	28957	" Mrs. Smith now began to suspect that she was honoured with the visit of a devout minister of some particular sect to which the deceased had probably belonged . But before she had time to mention her supposition , the stranger resumed his highly edifying discourse . "
387751	387760	387801	387803	my dear madam	28957	" he said , turning up his eyes , "
387805	387824	387799	387799	madam	26758	" continued the stranger , apparently on the point of bursting out into a perfect agony of grief , "
387872	387873	387878	387878	sir	26649	" "
387880	387885	387886	387886	I	0	" said Mrs. Smith , "
387936	387937	387938	387938	I	0	" "
387955	387967	387953	387953	ma'am	26745	" observed the stranger , in a tone of deep solemnity . "
387973	387979	387971	387971	ma'am	26745	" he continued , rising , "
388008	388096	388097	388097	I	0	" Mrs. Smith , thinking within herself that the visitor must have some legitimate authority for his present proceeding , and presuming that he would condescend to impart to her the nature of that authority ere he took his leave , conducted him with very little hesitation to the room where the deceased lay stretched upon the bed . The corpse was covered with a clean white sheet ; for every thing , though excessively homely , was still neat and decent in the widow 's dwelling . "
388102	388123	388097	388097	I	0	" said the stranger , advancing solemnly up to the bed , and drawing the sheet away from the corpse , "
388154	388182	388143	388143	ma'am	26745	" With these words the extraordinary stranger drew a rule gravely from his pocket , and proceeded to measure the corpse , saying at the same time , "
388203	388204	388195	388195	your	26745	" "
388216	388237	388195	388195	your	26745	" demanded the widow , somewhat astounded at the process of measurement which was now going on before her eyes . "
388248	388253	388195	388195	your	26745	" said the stranger : "
388275	388276	388266	388266	ma'am	26745	" "
388286	388287	388278	388278	I	0	" "

388338	388347	388336	388336	sir	26649	" asked Mrs. Smith , point - blank . "
388354	388376	388336	388336	sir	26649	" answered the stranger , with a shake of the head more solemn than any he had yet delivered himself of , "
388384	388385	388386	388386	Undertaker	11207	" "
388388	388410	388386	388386	Undertaker	11207	" ejaculated the widow , a light breaking in upon her as she thought of the systematic measurement of the body . "
388427	388428	388417	388417	ma'am	26745	" "
388439	388447	388431	388431	I	0	" said Mrs. Smith , somewhat disappointed . "
388456	388461	388451	388451	your	26745	" ejaculated the undertaker . "
388524	388583	388586	388588	my dear madam	28957	" Mournful , indeed , was the shake of the head that accompanied this latter assurance ; and the undertaker once more had recourse to his dingy pocket - handkerchief . The widow used the corner of her apron . Mr. Banks saw the advantage he had gained , and hastened to clench the object of his visit . "
388614	388615	388616	388616	Matthew	1302	" "
388620	388626	388616	388616	Matthew	1302	" said the widow mildly . "
388658	388665	388633	388633	ma'am	26745	" And Mr. Banks sobbed audibly . "
388668	388677	388633	388633	ma'am	26745	" observed the widow , wiping her eyes , "
388701	388702	388703	388703	Our	11227	" "
388761	388762	388765	388765	sir	26649	" "
388767	388778	388765	388765	sir	26649	" said the widow , after a moment 's reflection , "
388805	388806	388813	388814	Mrs. Smith	975	" "
388816	388821	388813	388814	Mrs. Smith	975	" exclaimed Mr. Banks . "

388890	388895	388896	388896	I	0	" asked the widow . "

388932	388937	388939	388939	I	0	" continued Mrs. Smith ; "
388963	388964	388958	388958	I	0	" "
388987	389027	388981	388981	Gentlemen	27077	" added Mr. Banks . Though he uttered a compliment , he did not smile ; but Mrs. Smith was flattered ; and , leading the way down stairs to her little parlour , she invited Mr. Banks to take "
389044	389215	388981	388981	Gentlemen	27077	" Mr. Banks accepted the civility ; and the costs of the funeral were duly settled . The undertaker engaged to inter the deceased lodger for five pounds , and pay all expenses . At length he took his leave ; and Mrs. Smith felt quite relieved from any anxiety respecting the obsequies of the deceased . From Mrs. Smith 's humble abode , the respectable Mr. Banks proceeded to the dwelling of the Resurrection Man , who had just returned from a visit to the surgeon that had attended upon the deceased . The success of this visit will be related hereafter ; for the present , let us hasten to inform our readers that Mr. Banks acquainted his friend Mr. Tidkins with every particular respecting his call upon the widow in Smart Street . WHEN Mr. Banks had taken his leave of the widow in Smart Street , Globe Town , the latter seated herself in her little parlour to reflect upon what had passed during the interview . "
389218	389224	388981	388981	Gentlemen	27077	" she said to herself , "
389446	389468	389434	389434	I	0	" A tap at the parlour door interrupted Mrs. Smith 's reverie ; and the Buffer 's wife entered the room . "
389478	389483	389471	389471	you	0	" said Moll Wicks . "
389495	389496	389491	389491	company	26787	" "
389507	389508	389504	389505	Mrs. Wicks	1303	" "
389517	389538	389511	389512	Mr. Banks	1300	" ejaculated the Buffer 's wife , who now began to comprehend a part of the Resurrection Man 's plan : "
389548	389549	389540	389543	a highly respectable individual	11268	" "
389561	389562	389551	389551	you	0	" "
389595	389619	389569	389569	He	1300	" answered Moll — although be it well remembered , she had never seen nor heard of Mr. Banks before the preceding evening . "
389632	389643	389626	389626	I	0	" observed the widow , extremely satisfied with this information . "
389662	389663	389651	389651	you	26745	" "
389667	389672	389651	389651	you	26745	" responded Mrs. Smith ; "
389692	389841	389680	389680	I	0	" Scarcely were these words uttered , when a modest double knock at the front door was heard — a summons which Mrs. Wicks volunteered to answer . The moment she opened the door , an ejaculation of surprise was about to issue from her tongue ; but the individual whom she saw upon the threshold put his finger to his lips to impose silence . The Buffer 's wife responded with a significant nod , and introduced the visitor into the widow 's parlour . Moll Wicks then withdrew to her own room . Meantime the visitor stood in the presence of Mrs. Smith , who beheld before her a short man , with a pale face , dark piercing eyes , shaggy brows , and long straggling black hair . He was dressed in a respectable suit of mourning , and wore a clean white cravat . "
389851	389856	389848	389848	I	0	" said the visitor ; "

389961	389981	389958	389959	reverend sir	11051	" said the widow , sinking her voice , and drawing her chair closer up to her sanctified visitor , "

390007	390012	389958	389959	reverend sir	11051	" was the reply . "

390646	390651	390642	390642	they	11315	" asked the widow . "

390859	390870	390828	390828	I	0	" said the saintly man , in an impressive tone . "
390883	390895	390881	390881	sir	26649	" demanded the widow , sinking her voice to a whisper . "
390913	390914	390915	390916	Resurrection men	11332	" "
390918	390930	390915	390916	Resurrection men	11332	" ejaculated the reverend visitor , bursting out into a laugh ; "

390957	390958	390950	390950	surgeons	11336	" "
390970	390975	390950	390950	surgeons	11336	" was the answer . "
390986	390996	390999	390999	ma'am	26745	" cried Mrs. Smith , revolting at the idea . "
391020	391021	391002	391003	the surgeons	11342	" "
391028	391038	391025	391025	my	0	" exclaimed the widow , wiping away a tear , "

391101	391107	391090	391090	ma'am	26745	" said the sanctified gentleman . "
391132	391149	391150	391150	I	0	" With these words the holy man rose from his seat , and prepared to depart . "
391169	391182	391183	391183	He	1300	" said the widow , as she conducted him to the door . "
391188	391974	391183	391183	He	1300	" was the reply ; and the reverend minister took his leave of Mrs. Smith , from whose mind a considerable load was removed by the suggestion she had received relative to the disposal of the money of her defunct lodger — a suggestion which she now determined to follow to the very letter . In the mean time the Rattlesnake had been left alone at the mysterious dwelling which she and her terrible paramour inhabited . Before the Resurrection Man went out , after the call of Mr. Banks , he threw aside his every - day garb , and put on a complete suit of black . He performed the ceremony of his toilet somewhat hurriedly ; and the Rattlesnake perceived with the most unfeigned delight that he forgot to transfer the contents of the pockets of his old garments to those of his new ones . At length he went out ; and the Rattlesnake instantly commenced a strict examination of the clothes which he had just put off . There were a few papers and dirty letters , but of those the woman took no notice . Neither did her fingers clutch greedily the three or four sovereigns which were contained in a greasy purse . A bunch of keys — the principal object of her search — rivetted all her attention — engrossed all her interest . Without a moment 's delay , she descended the stairs , and issued from the house . She darted up the narrow alley , paused at the side door , and tried the lock with the different keys . The last of all was the one which opened the door . The heart of the Rattlesnake beat with joy as she entered the passage , and closed the door carefully behind her . She first peeped into the front room , and by the faint light that was admitted through the heart - shaped holes in the shutters , she beheld only the implements peculiar to the avocation of a resurrection man ; namely , flexible iron rods to sound the depths of graves , and long poles with hooks at the ends to drag up bodies , together with saws , spades , pickaxes , trowels , ropes , skeleton - keys , & c. & c. The Rattlesnake then entered the back room , which was small , damp , and in a dilapidated condition . The plaster of the walls had given way in several places ; and the whole appearance of the chamber seemed to indicate that it had not been inhabited for many years . A table , a chair , and a cupboard were all the furniture which the room contained . On the table lay the mask , and over the chair hung the cloak in which the Resurrection Man had disguised himself on the preceding night . The basket , which she had seen him use on the same occasion , and which was of the kind that housewives take to market to hold their purchases , lay upon the floor . The contents and appearance of the room were visible by means of the light admitted through the shutters . The door of the cupboard was locked , but one of the keys which the Rattlesnake had with her speedily unlocked it . There , however , was nothing either to excite or allay her curiosity — for it was empty . She now proceeded to examine the chamber more carefully , expecting to find some secret communication with a subterranean excavation ; for she was still impressed with the idea that she had heard the steps of the Resurrection Man descend a flight of stairs on the preceding evening ; and she was also convinced that the scream she had then heard had proceeded from a greater distance or lower depth than the small back chamber in which she now found herself . But all her attempts to penetrate this mystery were unavailing ; and , fearful that the Resurrection Man might return and detect her proceedings , she hastened away from the ground floor of this strange house . Carefully locking the doors after her , she succeeded in reaching the upper story and replacing the keys where she had found them , some time ere she heard the steps of the Resurrection Man ascending the staircase . When he entered the bed - room to change his clothes once more , he found her busily engaged in some domestic occupation ; and , as she welcomed him in her usual manner , not a suspicion of her proceedings entered his mind . "
391977	391988	391989	391989	I	0	" he said , as he assumed his common garb , "
392061	392070	392073	392074	Richard Markham	874	" he added , with a ferocious leer , "
392076	392286	392073	392074	Richard Markham	874	" WE must now go back to the preceding day , and introduce our readers to Markham Place , immediately after the Buffer had called upon Richard in the manner already described . Richard had received him in the library , and had there heard the exciting news of which the Buffer was the bearer . Dismissing the man to the kitchen to partake of some refreshment , Richard hastened to the parlour , where Mr. Monroe and Ellen were seated . The past sorrows and anxieties which the young man had experienced were now all forgotten : forgotten also was the dread exposure which he had so recently received at the theatre,—an exposure which had deprived him of the honourable renown earned by his own talent,—an exposure , too , which had induced Ellen to abandon that career wherein she excelled so pre - eminently . The idea of meeting his well - beloved brother now alone occupied his mind:—the hope of seeing and even succouring the wanderer banished every other consideration . His cheek , lately so pale , was flushed with a glow of animation , and his eyes glistened with delight , as he rushed into the room where Ellen and her father were seated . "
392299	392303	392304	392305	Your brother	2221	" he exclaimed . "
392307	392317	392318	392318	Eugene	879	" repeated Ellen , deadly pallor overspreading her countenance . "
392320	392332	392318	392318	Eugene	879	" cried Mr. Monroe , in a tone of deep interest . "
392343	392381	392382	392382	Eugene	879	" answered Richard , not noticing the strange impression which his words had made , and still produced upon Ellen , who now sat incapable of motion in her chair , as if she were suddenly paralyzed : "
392411	392412	392387	392388	A man	2001	" "
392418	392423	392387	392388	A man	2001	" said Mr. Monroe . "
392432	392433	392387	392388	A man	2001	" "
392477	392478	392466	392466	I	0	" "
392486	392499	392481	392481	you	0	" inquired Monroe , somewhat surprised by the singularity of this announcement . "
392521	392522	392481	392481	you	0	" "
392528	392534	392481	392481	you	0	" demanded the old man . "
392544	392549	392481	392481	you	0	" was the reply . "
392568	392580	392586	392587	the man	2092	" asked Ellen , who now began to breathe more freely . "
392616	392617	392618	392618	I	0	" "
392624	392640	392618	392618	I	0	" said Ellen , with peculiar emphasis on her words and warmth in her manner . "
392647	392694	392618	392618	I	0	" cried Markham , unwilling to allow the hope which had a moment ago appeared so bright , to be obscured by the mists of doubt : then , acting upon a sudden impulse , he rang the bell violently . Whittingham speedily made his appearance . "
392704	392710	392695	392702	The man that I have just sent below	11373	" said Richard , hastily , "
392723	392724	392695	392702	The man that I have just sent below	11373	" "
392730	392748	392750	392750	he	879	" ejaculated the old butler , forgetting his gravity , and literally beginning to dance with joy . "
392770	392774	392750	392750	he	879	" continued Markham . "
392787	392788	392783	392784	Miss Monroe	1117	" "
392802	392817	392796	392796	Richard	874	" exclaimed Ellen , with the same emphasis which had marked her previous declaration . "
392824	392828	392791	392791	I	0	" said Markham , "
392850	392872	392847	392847	your	881	" The old butler withdrew to execute these orders . Markham then began to pace the room in an agitated manner . "
392891	392895	392931	392931	he	2092	" he said , "
392963	392964	392965	392966	Many persons	8123	" "
392976	392980	392965	392966	Many persons	8123	" said Ellen . "
393015	393016	392984	393013	an individual in this neighbourhood who is ignorant of the meeting that is named for the 10th of July , 1843 , between the ash - trees on that hill	11385	" "
393019	393023	392984	393013	an individual in this neighbourhood who is ignorant of the meeting that is named for the 10th of July , 1843 , between the ash - trees on that hill	11385	" exclaimed Markham . "
393071	393072	393073	393073	I	0	" "
393096	393100	393094	393094	Richard	874	" persisted Ellen ; "
393153	393154	393155	393155	You	11393	" "
393161	393165	393155	393155	You	11393	" said Markham ; "
393198	393199	393200	393200	I	0	" "
393207	393211	393200	393200	I	0	" returned Ellen . "
393238	393239	393242	393242	you	11393	" "
393247	393251	393242	393242	you	11393	" inquired Richard . "
393260	393266	393252	393252	I	0	" answered the old man : "
393293	393303	393291	393291	Ellen	1117	" At this moment Whittingham returned to the parlour . "
393315	393319	393291	393291	Ellen	1117	" said Whittingham ; "
393349	393350	393351	393351	You	11393	" "
393356	393360	393351	393351	You	11393	" asked Markham . "
393400	393401	393402	393402	He	2221	" "
393413	393417	393402	393402	He	2221	" persisted Richard . "
393426	393430	393418	393418	He	2221	" replied Whittingham . "
393448	393449	393434	393434	he	2221	" "
393455	393459	393460	393460	I	0	" ejaculated Richard : "
393585	393601	393663	393663	God	880	" Whittingham withdrew ; and Ellen once more endeavoured to deter Richard from his resolution . "
393610	393659	393663	393663	God	880	" she exclaimed , with an earnestness which , had he not been otherwise preoccupied , would have struck him by its peculiarity , for it seemed rather the impassioned expression of a conviction based on indisputable grounds , than a doubt which might be based on truth or error;—"in
393750	393751	393741	393743	the same miscreant	11407	" "
393761	393767	393756	393756	you	874	" said Markham , significantly ; "
393805	393860	393799	393799	I	0	" Markham uttered these words in a tone which left no scope for further argument or remonstrance ; and Ellen threw herself back in her chair , a prey to reflections of the most painful nature . At length she retired to her chamber to meditate in secret upon the incident of the morning . "
393866	393871	393863	393863	I	0	" she mused aloud , "
393943	393968	394012	394014	that terrible man	11410	" But she shook her head impatiently , as if to renounce as impracticable the idea which had for a moment occupied her mind . "
393971	393975	394012	394014	that terrible man	11410	" she continued , "
394082	394100	394145	394145	him	874	" said Ellen , a shudder passing , like a cold chill , over her entire frame : "
394159	394230	394231	394233	My faithful friend	3596	" She smiled , in spite of the unpleasant nature of the emotions that agitated her bosom,—she smiled , because a wild and romantic idea had entered her imagination . Without further hesitation,—and acting under the sudden impulse of that idea,—she sate down and wrote a short note . When she had sealed and addressed it , she rang the bell . In a few moments Marian answered the summons . "
394235	394239	394231	394233	My faithful friend	3596	" said Ellen , "
394285	394286	394274	394274	You	3596	" "
394304	394308	394291	394291	I	0	" said Marian . "
394313	394317	394291	394291	I	0	" continued Ellen , "
394345	394346	394340	394341	Mr. Greenwood	903	" "
394351	394355	394347	394348	Mr. Greenwood	903	" ejaculated Marian . "
394454	394455	394445	394445	he	1271	" "
394463	394467	394461	394461	Miss	11425	" said Marian ; "
394474	394475	394461	394461	Miss	11425	" "
394490	394494	394487	394487	his	903	" continued Ellen . "
394555	394556	394540	394540	I	0	" "
394572	394576	394563	394563	Miss	11427	" returned Marian . "
394588	394592	394593	394593	you	3596	" said Ellen , "
394606	394607	394608	394608	I	0	" "
394616	394620	394614	394614	Miss	11428	" observed Marian . "
394630	394631	394622	394622	you	3596	" "
394637	394641	394642	394642	I	0	" answered Ellen . "
394714	394715	394701	394701	Marian	1264	" "
394721	394730	394701	394701	Marian	1264	" exclaimed Marian , in a kind tone ; "
394736	394737	394701	394701	Marian	1264	" "
394745	394751	394743	394743	Marian	1264	" added Ellen , solemnly , "
394772	394846	394701	394701	Marian	1264	" HOLYWELL Street was once noted only as a mart for second - hand clothing , and booksellers ' shops dealing in indecent prints and volumes . The reputation it thus acquired was not a very creditable one . Time has , however , included Holywell Street in the clauses of its Reform Bill . Several highly respectable booksellers and publishers have located themselves in the place that once deserved no better denomination than "
394850	395159	394701	394701	Marian	1264	" The unprincipled venders of demoralizing books and pictures have , with few exceptions , migrated into Wych Street or Drury Lane ; and even the two or three that pertinaciously cling to their old temples of infamy in Holywell Street , seem to be aware of the incursions of respectability into that once notorious thoroughfare , and cease to outrage decency by the display of vile obscenities in their windows . The reputation of Holywell Street has now ceased to be a by - word : it is respectable ; and , as a mart for the sale of literary wares , threatens to rival Paternoster Row . It is curious to observe that , while butchers , tailors , linen - drapers , tallow - manufacturers , and toy - venders , are gradually dislodging the booksellers of Paternoster Row , and thus changing the once exclusive nature of this famous street into one of general features , the booksellers , on the other hand , are gradually ousting the old - clothes dealers of Holywell Street . As the progress of the American colonist towards the far - west drives before it the aboriginal inhabitants , so do the inroads of the bibliopoles menace the Israelites of Holywell Street with total extinction . Paternoster Row and Holywell Street are both losing their primitive features : the former is becoming a mart of miscellaneous trades ; the latter is rising into a bazaar of booksellers . Already has Holywell Street progressed far towards this consummation . On the southern side of the thoroughfare scarcely a clothes shop remains ; and those on the opposite side wear a dirty and miserably dilapidated appearance . The huge masks , which denote the warehouse where masquerading and fancy - attire may be procured on sale or hire , seem to "
395166	395529	394701	394701	Marian	1264	" as if they knew that their occupation was all but gone . The red - haired ladies who stand at their doors beneath a canopy of grey trousers with black seats , and blue coats with brown elbows — a distant imitation of Joseph 's garment of many colours — seem dispirited and care - worn , and no longer watch , with the delighted eyes of maternal affection , their promising offspring playing in the gutters . Their glances are turned towards the east — a sure sign that they meditate an early migration to the pleasant regions which touch upon the Minories . Holywell Street is now a thoroughfare which no one can decry on the score of reputation : it is , however , impossible to deny that , were the southern range of houses pulled down , the Strand would reap an immense advantage , and a fine road would be opened from the New Church to Saint Clement Danes . It was about half - past seven in the evening that Ellen Monroe , dressed in the most simple manner , and enveloped in a large cloak , entered Holywell Street . Her countenance was pale ; but its expression was one of resolution and firmness . She walked slowly along from the west end of the street towards the eastern extremity , glancing anxiously upon the countenances of those traders who stood in front of the second - hand clothes shops . At length she beheld a female — one of the identical ladies with red hair above alluded to — standing on the threshold of one of those warehouses . Ellen looked upwards , and perceived all kinds of articles of male attire suspended over the head of this female , and swinging backwards and forwards , like so many men hanging , upon the shop - front . Ellen paused — glanced wistfully at the Jewess , and appeared to hesitate . Her manner was so peculiar , that , although the clothes venders do not usually solicit the custom of females , the Jewess immediately exclaimed in a sharp under - tone , "
395536	395550	394701	394701	Marian	1264	" Ellen turned , without another moment 's hesitation , into the shop . "
395565	395570	395563	395563	myself	0	" said Miss Monroe . "
395584	395638	395645	395645	you	26745	" These last words denoted a customer of precisely the nature that was most agreeable to the Jewess . She accordingly bustled about her , ransacked drawers and cupboards , and spread such a quantity of coats , trousers , and waistcoats , before Ellen , that the young lady was quite bewildered . "
395651	395662	395645	395645	you	26745	" said Miss Monroe , after a moment 's hesitation ; "
395675	395676	395645	395645	you	26745	" "
395681	395706	395645	395645	you	26745	" answered the Jewess ; and , having looked out a suit , she conducted Ellen up stairs into her own sleeping - apartment . "
395719	395721	395709	395709	I	0	" said Ellen;—"in
395742	396277	395735	395735	I	0	" she added , with a smile . The Jewess made no reply : it did not concern her , if her customer chose to metamorphose herself , so long as she was paid ; and she accordingly hastened to supply all the remaining apparel necessary to complete the disguise . She then left Ellen to dress herself at leisure . And soon that charming form was clothed in the raiment of the other sex : those delicate feet and ankles were encased in heavy boots ; thick blue trousers hampered the limbs lately so supple in the voluptuous dance ; a coarse shirt and faded silk waistcoat imprisoned the lovely bosom ; a collar and black neckcloth concealed the swan - like neck and dazzling whiteness of the throat ; and a capacious frock coat concealed the admirable symmetry of the faultless figure . The hair was then gathered up in a manner which would not betray the sex of the wearer of those coarse habiliments , especially when the disguise was aided by the darkness of the night , and when that luxuriant mass was covered with the broad - brimmed and somewhat slouching hat which the Jewess had provided for the purpose . Ellen 's toilette was thus completed , and she then descended to the shop . The Jewess — perhaps not altogether unaccustomed to such occurrences — made no comment , and took no impertinent notice of the metamorphosed lady . She contented herself with asking a handsome price for the clothes and accommodation afforded ; and Ellen paid the sum without a murmur , merely observing that she should send for her own apparel next day . Miss Monroe then left the shop , and issued from Holywell Street just as the church clocks in the neighbourhood struck eight . The reader has , doubtless , seen enough of her character to be well aware that she had acquired a considerable amount of fortitude and self - possession from the various circumstances in which she had been placed : she was not , therefore , now likely to betray any diffidence or timidity as she threaded , in male attire , the crowded streets of the metropolis . She threw into her gait as much assurance as possible ; and thus , without exciting any particular notice , she pursued her way towards the eastern districts of the great city . The weather was cold and damp ; but the rain , which had fallen in torrents the day before , had apparently expended its rage for a short interval . A sharp wind , however , swept through the streets ; and Ellen pitied the poor shivering , half - naked wretches , whom she saw huddling upon steps , or crouching beneath archways , as she passed along . Ellen walked rapidly , and having gained Bishopsgate Street , proceeded as far as the terminus of the Eastern Counties Railway . There she halted , and glanced anxiously around her . In a few minutes , a tall man , wrapped up in a large cloak , came up to the spot where she was standing . "
396284	396288	396280	396280	you	11443	" said Ellen . "
396302	396310	396293	396293	I	0	" returned Mr. Greenwood 's Italian valet . "
396342	396343	396339	396339	my	0	" "
396361	396365	396366	396366	Your	11444	" said Ellen . "
396427	396428	396429	396429	I	0	" "
396434	396438	396429	396429	I	0	" answered Filippo . "
396528	396547	396549	396549	Ellen	1117	" You will this night be the means of rendering an essential service to a fellow - creature , "
396556	396642	396549	396549	Ellen	1117	" A foul conspiracy against him,—whether to take his life or for other purposes of villany , I know not,—has been devised ; and he has blindly fallen into the snare that has been spread for him . At ten o'clock he is to attend an appointment on the banks of the canal at a place called Twig Folly . We must proceed thither : we must watch at a little distance ; and , if need be , we must interpose to save him . "
396643	396651	396653	396654	the Italian	33343	" A more simple plan , Miss , "
396656	396667	396653	396654	the Italian	33343	" would be to warn this individual of his danger . "
396668	396684	396686	396686	Ellen	1117	" I have done so ; but he will not believe that treachery is intended , "
396688	396712	396653	396654	the Italian	33343	" Then another effectual manner to counteract the designs of villains in such a case is to obtain the assistance of the police . "
396713	396738	396653	396654	the Italian	33343	" No , Filippo ; such a proceeding would lead to inquiries and investigations whence would transpire circumstances that must not be made known . "
396739	396761	396763	396764	the Italian	33343	" Miss Monroe , this proceeding on your part is so mysterious , that I hesitate whether to accompany you further , "
396790	396803	396805	396805	Ellen	1117	" Come with me — do not hesitate — I implore you , "
396807	396856	396858	396858	Ellen	1117	" If you persist in penetrating my motives for acting in this strange manner , I will tell you all , rather than you should retreat at a moment when it is too late for me to obtain other succour . And be your resolve as it may , "
396862	396902	396858	396858	Ellen	1117	" nothing shall induce me to turn back . Desert me — abandon me if you will , Filippo ; but , in the name of every thing sacred , lend me the weapons which you carry with you . "
396926	396934	396935	396935	he	11456	" I will believe , Miss Monroe , "
396941	396954	396935	396935	he	11456	" that your motives are excellent ; but are you well advised ? "
396955	396958	396960	396960	Ellen	1117	" Listen , "
396962	396998	396960	396960	Ellen	1117	" The individual , whose life we may perhaps this night save , is Richard Markham — the generous young man who has been a son to my father , and a brother to myself . "
396999	397011	397013	397013	Filippo	1271	" I have heard Mr. Greenwood mention his name many times , "
397015	397045	397047	397047	Ellen	1117	" He believes that he is to meet his brother , from whom he has been for many years separated , this night on the banks of the canal , "
397049	397094	397096	397096	Ellen	1117	" For certain reasons I know most positively that the idea of such an appointment can only be a plot on the part of some enemies of Richard Markham . And yet I dared not communicate those reasons to him — Oh ! no , "
397102	397109	397096	397096	Ellen	1117	" that was impossible — impossible ! "
397110	397124	397126	397126	Filippo	1271	" I do not seek to penetrate further into your secrets , Miss , "
397164	397177	397179	397179	Ellen	1117	" And the necessity of keeping those certain reasons a profound secret , "
397181	397333	397179	397179	Ellen	1117	" has also prevented me from procuring the intervention of the police . In the same way , should the result of our present expedition introduce you to the notice of Mr. Markham , it would be necessary for you to retain as a profound secret who you are — how you came to accompany me — and especially your connexion with Mr. Greenwood . Not for worlds must the name of Greenwood be mentioned in the presence of Richard Markham ! If it should be necessary to enter into explanations with him , leave that task to me ; and contradict nothing that you may hear me state . I have my motives for all I do and all I say — motives so grave , so important , that , did you know them all , you would applaud and not doubt me . And now are you satisfied ? "
397334	397337	397339	397339	Filippo	1271	" Perfectly , "
397341	397354	397339	397339	Filippo	1271	" I will not ask another question , nor hesitate another moment . "
397355	397363	397365	397365	Ellen	1117	" My everlasting gratitude is your due , "
397367	397379	397365	397365	Ellen	1117	" And now , one more favour have I to ask . "
397380	397384	397386	397387	the Italian	33343	" Name it , "
397389	397397	397386	397387	the Italian	33343	" Give me one of your pistols . "
397398	397404	397365	397365	Ellen	1117	" But , Miss Monroe — "
397405	397434	397435	397436	The Italian	33343	" Pray do not refuse me ! I am not a coward ; and I must inform you that I learnt to fire a pistol at the theatre . "
397553	397946	397543	397543	he	2266	" If my brother be involved in pecuniary difficulties,—or if he have committed any imprudence , from the results of which money may release him,—how gladly will I dispose of the remainder of my small income — how joyfully will I devote all I possess to aid him ! And then , when I have no other resources , I will open the mysterious document which Thomas Armstrong placed in my hands ere he breathed his last ; and I feel convinced that I shall at least receive therefrom good advice — if not pecuniary succour — to guide me in future . O Eugene ! is it possible that I am now about to meet you once more ? On the 10th of July , 1831 , did we part on the summit of the hill which overlooks the mansion of our ancestors . This is the 2d of January , 1840 . Eight years and a half have now elapsed since the day of our separation . Ah ! I know the proud — the haughty — the independent disposition of my brother ! Were he prosperous — were he successful in his pursuits , ( be those pursuits what they may , ) he would not seek me now . He would wait until the accomplishment of the twelve years : he would not seek me until the 10th of July , 1843 . Then should we compare notes , and ascertain who was the more prosperous ! Yes — this would be my brother 's mode of conduct . And therefore he is unhappy — he is unfortunate , that he seeks me ere the time be elapsed : he is perhaps poor — in want — who knows ? Oh ! how sincerely I hope that this is no delusion ; that my unfortunate star will not pursue me even unto the point of so terrible a disappointment ! No — I feel that this is no deception — that Eugene indeed awaits me . Who could wish to injure me ? who would desire to take my life ? who could hope to obtain a treasure by laying a plot to rob me ? The idea is preposterous ! Yes — the appointment is a genuine one : I am about to meet my brother Eugene ! "
398216	398224	398226	398227	the individual	8955	" True to your appointment , sir , "
398241	398251	398253	398253	Markham	874	" I told you that I should not fail , "
398275	398292	398253	398253	Markham	874	" But what of my brother ? will he come ? is he near ? Speak ! "
398293	398303	398305	398306	the man	2092	" He will be here in a few moments , "
398323	398328	398330	398330	Markham	874	" Are you sure ? "
398332	398349	398330	398330	Markham	874	" Why has he sent you first ? could he suspect treachery from his own brother ? "
398350	398357	398359	398360	the Buffer	29668	" Not a bit of it , "
398362	398373	398359	398360	the Buffer	29668	" Only — but here he comes , sure enow . "
398400	398408	398410	398411	the Buffer	29668	" Here is your brother , sir , "
398413	398419	398421	398421	Richard	874	" Eugene — dear Eugene ! "
398433	398437	398443	398445	the Resurrection Man	952	" Brother indeed ! "
398476	398479	398481	398481	Richard	874	" Villains ! "
398515	398521	398523	398525	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Now , my lad , "
398527	398550	398551	398551	He	3220	" your fate is decided . In a few minutes you 'll be at the bottom of the canal , and then — "
398955	398958	398951	398953	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Run ! run!"—but
398974	398981	398983	398983	Filippo	1271	" The villains!—they have drowned him ! "
398999	399003	399005	399005	Ellen	1117	" Brave man ! "
399007	399016	399005	399005	Ellen	1117	" Save him — oh ! save him ! "
399083	399121	399080	399080	she	1117	" Here is a rope , Filippo : Richard , try and catch the rope . Speak , Filippo — can you save him ? If not , I will myself plunge into the stream — and — "
399122	399131	399133	399133	Filippo	1271	" He is lost — he is gone ! "
399155	399168	399133	399133	Filippo	1271	" Oh , God ! do not say that ! do not — "
399169	399189	399080	399080	she	1117	" I see him — I see him , Miss — yonder — down the stream — struggling desperately — "
399314	399323	399303	399303	Ellen	1117	" He is saved — he is saved ! "
399376	399380	399364	399364	his	1271	" He lives ! "
399381	399386	399388	399388	Ellen	1117	" Heaven be thanked ! "
399448	399453	399441	399441	he	1271	" Where am I ? "
399454	399457	399459	399459	Ellen	1117	" Saved ! "
399461	399469	399441	399441	he	1271	" None but friends are near you . "
399519	399539	399540	399540	he	1271	" Ellen — is that you ? can this be you ? was it your voice that I heard ? "
399548	399555	399540	399540	he	1271	" or is it a vision ? "
399556	399594	399540	399540	he	1271	" It is no vision , Richard — it is indeed Ellen , who owes you so much , and who has been the humble instrument — aided by this brave man — of saving your life . "
399595	399603	399605	399605	Markham	874	" And who is this brave man ? "
399607	399635	399540	399540	he	1271	" Tell me his name , that I may pour forth my gratitude to him , as well as to you , kind Ellen — my sister ! "
399636	399640	399642	399642	Ellen	1117	" His sister ! "
399664	399665	399540	399540	he	1271	words—"his sister!"—were
399674	399683	399685	399685	Ellen	1117	" Do not fatigue yourself by speaking now , "
399693	399786	399685	399685	Ellen	1117	" Suffice it for the present to tell you that I was afraid of treachery towards you — I had my misgivings — a presentiment of evil haunted me ! I owed you so much , that I was determined to watch over your safety — weak and powerless as I am . Hence this strange attire . Fortunately I met this brave man — a total stranger to me — near the spot ; and , when I communicated my object to him , he generously offered to bear me company . "
399787	399792	399794	399794	Richard	874	" Excellent girl!—generous stranger ! "
399796	399813	399794	399794	Richard	874	" I owe you my life . Oh ! how can I ever express my gratitude ? "
399814	399826	399828	399828	Filippo	1271	" We must not speak on that subject now , sir , "
399830	399844	399828	399828	Filippo	1271	" The chief point to be considered is how to get you home . "
399845	399856	399859	399859	Ellen	1117	" And he lives so far from here , too , "
399915	399926	399928	399930	the young man	2266	" Oh ! this bitter disappointment — this vile treachery ! "
399951	399955	399957	399957	Ellen	1117	" Compose yourself , "
399967	400005	399957	399957	Ellen	1117	" compose yourself , Richard ; and do not excite yourself by unpleasant reflections . Let us rather think how we are to convey you home . There is no vehicle to be obtained in this neighbourhood . "
400006	400014	399957	399957	Ellen	1117	" I feel myself able to walk , "
400016	400030	399957	399957	Ellen	1117	Markham,—"at least as far as the nearest place where we can procure conveyance . "
400031	400039	400041	400041	Filippo	1271	" Wrap yourself up in my cloak , "
400043	400066	400041	400041	Filippo	1271	" It is close at hand — I took it off and concealed it under yonder tree , before the conflict began . "
400160	400171	400173	400173	Filippo	1271	" I shall now take leave of you , sir , "
400175	400195	400173	400173	Filippo	1271	" and I most sincerely hope that you will soon recover from the effects of this night 's maltreatment . "
400196	400200	400202	400202	Markham	874	" Generous man ! "
400204	400213	400202	400202	Markham	874	" tell me your name that I may — "
400220	400224	400226	400226	Markham	874	" How strange ! "
400228	400259	400226	400226	Markham	874	" That noble - hearted foreigner makes light of his own good deeds . He has left me no opportunity of expressing my gratitude more fully than by mere words . "
400260	400273	400275	400275	Ellen	1117	" He is evidently a man of lofty feelings and generous disposition , "
400278	400293	400294	400294	She	1117	" It was fortunate that I happened to encounter him in that lonely spot . "
400708	400725	400729	400739	men in the receipt of eight or ten shillings a week	11568	" Well , prefer an indictment at the sessions , if you do n't like it ! "
400965	400980	400960	400960	he	11578	" Whose grave must I disturb now to make room for the new one ? "
401011	401016	400983	400983	he	11578	" This will do . "
402224	402238	402208	402208	he	11636	" surely his superiors must know what was right and what was wrong ! "
402440	402446	402448	402451	the grave - digger	11578	" Mornin ' , sir , "
402453	402486	402448	402451	the grave - digger	11578	" Come to have a look at the size of the grave , s'pose ? You 've no call to be afeard ; I 'll be bound to make it big enow . "
402487	402501	402503	402504	the undertaker	32765	" I hope it wo n't be a very deep one , Jones , "
402506	402523	402503	402504	the undertaker	32765	" Somehow or another the friends of the blessed defunct are awerse to a deep grave . "
402524	402542	402544	402544	Jones	937	" My orders is to dig down sixteen feet and shore up the sides as I deepens , "
402546	402593	402544	402544	Jones	937	" Do n't you see that I shall throw the earth on wery light , so that it wo n't take scarcely no trouble to shovel it out agin ; 'cos the next seven as comes to this ground must all go into that there grave . "
402594	402598	402600	402601	the undertaker	32765	" Sixteen feet ! "
402606	402651	402600	402601	the undertaker	32765	" It will never do , Jones . The friends of the dear deceased would n't sleep quiet in their beds if they thought he had to sleep so deep in his'n . It wo n't do , Jones — it wo n't do . "
402652	402663	402665	402668	the grave - digger	11578	" My orders is sich from the proprietors , sir , "
402679	402690	402692	402693	the undertaker	32765	" Now I tell you what it is , Jones , "
402701	402738	402692	402693	the undertaker	32765	" not another grave will I ever order in this ground , and not another carkiss that I undertake shall come here , unless you choose to comply with my wishes concerning this blessed old defunct . "
402739	402776	402778	402778	Jones	937	" Well , Mr. Banks , there is n't a gen'leman wot undertakes in all Globe Town , or from Bonner 's Fields down to Mile End Gate , that I 'd sooner obleege than yourself , "
402785	402795	402778	402778	Jones	937	" but if so be I transgresses my orders — "
402796	402802	402804	402804	Banks	1300	" Who will know it ? "
402806	402831	402804	402804	Banks	1300	" You have whole and sole charge of the ground ; and it ca n't be often that the proprietors come to trouble you . "
402832	402843	402778	402778	Jones	937	" Well , sir , there is summut in that — "
402844	402864	402778	402778	Jones	937	" And then , instead of five shillings for yourself , I should not hesitate to make it ten — "
402865	402880	402804	402804	Banks	1300	" That 's business , Mr. Banks . How deep must the grave be ? "
402881	402888	402778	402778	Jones	937	" How deep is it already ? "
402889	402898	402900	402900	Jones	937	" A matter of nine feet , sir , "
402902	402911	402913	402914	the undertaker	32765	" Then not another hinch must you move , "
402918	402929	402913	402914	the undertaker	32765	" and here 's the ten bob as an earnest . "
402945	402956	402958	402958	Jones	937	" When 's the funeral a - coming , sir ? "
402964	402969	402971	402972	Mr. Banks	1300	" At two precisely , "
402974	402986	402988	402991	the grave - digger	11578	" Rale parson , or von of your men as usual ? "
402995	403035	403037	403038	the undertaker	32765	" Oh , a friend of mine — a wery pious , savoury , soul - loving wessel , Jones — a man that it 'll do your heart good to hear . But , I say , Jones , "
403040	403048	403037	403038	the undertaker	32765	" you 're getting uncommon full here . "
403049	403062	403037	403038	the undertaker	32765	" Yes , full enow , sir ; but I makes room . "
403063	403069	403071	403071	Banks	1300	" I see you do , "
403078	403086	403071	403071	Banks	1300	" what a offensive smell it makes . "
403087	403104	403106	403106	Jones	937	" And would you believe that I can scarcely support it myself sometimes , Mr. Banks ? "
403108	403126	403106	403106	Jones	937	" But , arter all , our ground is n't so bad as some others in London . "
403127	403134	403136	403137	the undertaker	32765	" I know it is n't , "
403139	403150	403152	403155	the grave - digger	11578	" Now ai n't it a odd thing , sir , "
403157	403202	403152	403155	the grave - digger	11578	" that persons which dwells up in decent neighbourhoods like , and seems exceedin ' proud of their fine houses and handsome shops , should n't notice the foul air that comes from places only hid by a low wail or a thin paling ? "
403203	403210	403212	403213	Mr. Banks	1300	" It is indeed odd enough , "
403215	403231	403233	403233	Jones	937	" Well , I knows the diggers in some o ' the yards more west , "
403235	403281	403233	403233	Jones	937	" and I 've heerd from them over and over agin that they pursues just the wery same course as we does here — has a Bone - House or some such conwenient place , and burns the coffins and bones that is turned up . "
403282	403291	403293	403294	Mr. Banks	1300	" I suppose it is necessary , Jones ? "
403296	403306	403308	403311	the grave - digger	11578	" Necessary , sir ? in course it be , "
403313	403339	403308	403311	the grave - digger	11578	" On'y fancy wot a lot of burials takes place every year in London ; and room must be made for 'em somehow or other . "
403340	403349	403351	403352	the undertaker	32765	" Ah ! I know something about that , "
403354	403453	403351	403352	the undertaker	32765	" Calkilations have been made which proves that the average life of us poor weak human creeturs is thirty - five years ; so , if London contains a million and a half of people , a million and a half of persons dies , and is buried in the course of every thirty - five years . Is n't that a fine thing for them that 's in the undertaking line ? 'cause it 's quite clear that there 's a million and a half of funerals in every thirty - five years in this blessed city . "
403454	403467	403469	403469	Jones	937	" And a million and a half of graves or waults rekvired , "
403471	403498	403469	403469	Jones	937	" Well , then , who the deuce can blame us for burning up the old ' uns to make room for the new ' uns ? "
403499	403504	403506	403507	Mr. Banks	1300	" Who , indeed ? "
403509	403688	403506	403507	Mr. Banks	1300	" T'other day I had an undertaking , which was buried in Enon Chapel , Saint Clement 's Lane,—down there by Lincoln 's Inn , you know . The chapel 's surrounded by houses , all okkipied by poor people , and the stench is horrid . The fact is , that the chapel 's divided into two storeys : the upper one is the preaching place ; and the underneath one is the burial place . There 's only a common boarded floor to separate 'em . You go down by a trap - door in the floor ; and pits is dug below for the coffins . Why , at one end the place is so full , that the coffins is piled up till they touch the ceiling — that is , the floor of the chapel itself , and there 's only a few inches of earth over 'em . The common sewer runs through the place ; so , what with that and the coffins and carkisses , it 's a nice hole . "
403689	403694	403696	403696	Jones	937	" Wuss than this ? "
403698	403704	403706	403706	Banks	1300	" Of course it is , "
403708	403740	403742	403743	the undertaker	32765	" 'cause at all ewents this is out in the open air , while t'other 's shut up and close . But I 'll tell you what it is , Jones , "
403760	403822	403750	403750	he	32765	" the people that lives in that densely - populated quarter about Saint Clement 's Lane , exists in the midst of a pestilence . Why they breathe nothing but the putrid stench of the Enon burial - place , the Green Ground in Portugal Street , and the Alms - House burying ground down at the bottom of the Lane . "
403823	403842	403844	403844	Jones	937	" All that 'll breed a plague von o ' these days in the werry middle of London , "
403846	403853	403855	403856	the undertaker	32765	" Not a doubt of it , "
403858	404014	403855	403856	the undertaker	32765	" But I have n't done yet all I had to say about that quarter . Wery soon after a burial takes place at Enon Chapel , a queer - looking , long , narrow , black fly crawls out of the coffin . It is a production of the putrefaction of the dead body . But what do you think ? Next season this fly is succeeded by another kind of insect just like the common bug , and with wings . The children that go to Sunday - school at the Chapel calls 'em ' body bugs . ' Them insects is seen all through the summer flying or crawling about the Chapel . All the houses that overlooks the Chapel is infested with rats ; and if a poor creetur only hangs a bit of meat out of his window in the summer time , in a few hours it grows putrid . "
404015	404023	404025	404025	Jones	937	" Well , Mr. Banks , sir , "
404034	404054	404025	404025	Jones	937	" it 's wery lucky that you ai n't one o ' them chaps which writes books and nonsense . "
404055	404061	403855	403856	the undertaker	32765	" Why so , Jones ? "
404062	404111	403855	403856	the undertaker	32765	" 'Cos if you was to print all that you 've been tellin ' me , you 'd make the fortunes of them new cemetries that 's opened all round London , and the consekvence would be that the grounds in London would have to shut up shop . "
404112	404222	404025	404025	Jones	937	" Very true , Jones . But what I 'm saying to you now is only in confidence , and by way of chat . Why , do you know that the people round about the burying grounds in London — this one as well as any other — have seen the walls of their rooms covered at times with a sort of thick fatty fluid , which produces a smell that 's quite horrid ! Look at that burying place in Drury Lane . It 's so full of blessed carkisses , that the ground is level with the first - floor windows of the houses round it . "
404223	404245	404247	404247	Jones	937	" Well , it 's a happy thing to know that the world do n't trouble themselves with these here matters , "
404249	404328	404247	404247	Jones	937	" Thank God ! in my ground I clears and clears away , coffins and bodies both alike , as quick as I turns 'em up . Lord ! what a sight of coffin nails I sells every month to the marine - store dealers ; and yet people passes by them shops and sees second - hand coffin furniture put out for sale , never thinks of how it got there , and where it come from . "
404329	404336	404338	404338	Banks	1300	" Of course they do n't , "
404340	404365	404338	404338	Banks	1300	" What the devil do you think would become of a many trades if people always wondered , and wondered how they supported theirselves ? "
404366	404378	404380	404380	Jones	937	" You speaks like a book , Mr. Banks , sir , "
404382	404499	404380	404380	Jones	937	" Arter all , I 've often thought wot a fool I am not to sell the coffin - wood for fuel , as most other grave - diggers does in grounds that 's obleeged to be cleared of the old ' uns to make room for the new ' uns . But , I say , Mr. Banks , sir , I 've often been going to ask you a question about summut , and I 've always forgot it ; but talkin ' of these things puts me in mind of it . What 's the reason , sir , that gen'lemen in the undertaking line wery often bores holes right through the coffins ? "
404500	404514	404516	404517	Mr. Banks	1300	" That 's what we call ' tapping the coffin , ' Jones , "
404519	404618	404516	404517	Mr. Banks	1300	" and we do it whenever a body 's going to remain at home two or three days with the coffin - lid screwed down , before the funeral takes place . Poor people generally buries on Sunday : well , p'raps the coffin 's took home on Wednesday or Thursday , and then the body 's put in and the lid 's screwed tight down at once to save trouble when Sunday comes . Then we tap the coffin to let out the gas ; cause there is a gas formed by the decomposition of dead bodies . "[81
404620	404631	404633	404633	Jones	937	" Well , all that 's a cut above me , "
404635	404645	404633	404633	Jones	937	" And now I must get back to work — "
404646	404654	404656	404657	the undertaker	32765	" Not at that grave , mind , "
404659	404667	404656	404657	the undertaker	32765	" It musn't be another hinch deeper . "
404668	404697	404633	404633	Jones	937	" Not a bit , sir — I ai n't a goin' to touch it : but I 've got another place to open ; so here goes . "
404720	404735	404737	404738	Mr. Banks	1300	" At two o'clock , Jones , I shall be here with the funeral , "
404740	404746	404748	404748	Jones	937	" Wery good , sir , "
405198	405203	405437	405438	the Buffer	29668	" Booth 's best . "
405204	405207	405209	405210	Mr. Banks	1300	" Well , "
405212	405228	405209	405210	Mr. Banks	1300	" the worst part now is over . We have got the body under ground — "
405229	405239	405241	405243	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And we must soon get it up again , "
405246	405260	405241	405243	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You are sure the old woman put the money in the coffin ? "
405261	405268	405270	405271	the undertaker	32765	" I see her do it , "
405273	405289	405270	405271	the undertaker	32765	" She wrapped it up in a old stocking which belonged to the blessed defunct — "
405290	405295	405297	405298	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Blessed defunct indeed ! "
405305	405321	405323	405324	Mr. Banks	1300	" You see , ma'am , I ca n't divest myself of my professional lingo , "
405326	405367	405323	405324	Mr. Banks	1300	" It comes natural to me now . But as I was a saying , I see the old woman wrap the thirty - one quids up in the toe of a stocking , and put it on his breast — "
405368	405376	405378	405380	the Resurrection Man	3220	" On the shroud , or underneath ? "
405383	405386	405388	405388	Banks	1300	" Underneath , "
405390	405430	405388	405388	Banks	1300	" I took good care of that . I knowed very well that you 'd want to draw the body up by the head , and that the money must be so placed as to come along with it . "
405431	405435	405437	405438	the Buffer	29668	" Of course , "
405440	405478	405437	405438	the Buffer	29668	" or else we should have to dig out all the earth , and break open the lid of the coffin ; and that takes twice as long as to do the job t ' other way . "
405479	405494	405496	405496	Banks	1300	" At what time is the sawbones coming down to the grave - yard ? "
405498	405506	405496	405496	Banks	1300	" He is n't coming at all , "
405512	405533	405508	405510	the Resurrection Man	3220	" but I promised that we would be at his place at half - past one o'clock to - night . "
405534	405538	405540	405541	the Buffer	29668	" Too early ! "
405543	405563	405540	405541	the Buffer	29668	" We ca n't think of beginning work ' afore twelve . The place ai n't quiet till then . "
405564	405575	405577	405579	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Well , and an hour will do the business , "
405581	405647	405577	405579	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Besides , the saw - bones will set up for us . Now then , Meg , clear away , and let 's have the blue ruin and hot water . I must just write a short note to a gentleman with whom I have a little business of a private nature ; and you can run and take it to the post presently . "
405675	405688	405667	405667	he	3220	" Arthur Chichester , Esq . , Cambridge Heath , near Hackney . "
405715	405739	405710	405712	the Resurrection Man	952	" Now you and Moll try your hands at some punch,—and make it pretty stiff too — just as you like it yourselves . "
405917	405921	405922	405922	he	1300	" good subject , "
405964	405972	405927	405928	the resurrectionists	11722	" another glass , and another pipe , "
406032	406039	406040	406040	he	3220	" We must now be off , "
406043	406066	406040	406040	he	3220	" You , Banks , can go home and get the cart ready : the Buffer and me will go our way . "
406067	406078	406080	406081	the undertaker	32765	" At what time shall I come with the cart ? "
406083	406098	406100	406100	Tidkins	998	" At a quarter past one to a second — neither more nor less , "
406108	406121	406123	406127	the Buffer of his wife	11727	" Are you going to stay here with Meg , or what ? "
406129	406136	406138	406139	the Rattlesnake	1292	" I shall go to bed , "
406142	406151	406138	406139	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Tony can take the key with him . "
406152	406160	406162	406162	Moll	1264	" Then I shall be off home , "
406164	406181	406162	406162	Moll	1264	" Besides , Mrs. Smith may think it odd if we both remain out so late . "
406191	406197	406199	406201	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Now come , Jack , "
406203	406219	406199	406201	the Resurrection Man	3220	" We have no time to lose . There 's the tools to get out . "
406263	406267	406269	406269	Tidkins	1061	" Bustle about , "
406317	406334	406312	406313	the Buffer	29668	" What the devil was that ? I could have sworn I heard some one moaning . "
406335	406338	406340	406342	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Nonsense , "
406371	406383	406385	406386	the Buffer	29668	" Well , I never was more deceived in my life , "
406388	406394	406396	406398	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You certainly never was , "
406541	406548	406531	406531	she	27674	" Now for the great secret ! "
406684	406695	406696	406696	she	27674	" Then there is a human being concealed somewhere hereabouts ! "
406701	406731	406696	406696	she	27674	" or else why that food ! And it must have been the supply of bread and water that I saw him put into his basket the other night . "
407467	407493	407463	407464	the Buffer	29668	" I only hope , Tony , that this business wo n't turn out as bad as the job with young Markham three nights ago . "
407494	407499	407501	407503	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Why should it ? "
407510	407519	407521	407522	the Buffer	29668	" Well , I do n't know why , "
407524	407549	407521	407522	the Buffer	29668	" P'rhaps , after all , it was just as well that feller escaped as he did . We might have swung for it . "
407550	407553	407555	407557	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Escape ! "
407564	407591	407521	407522	the Buffer	29668	" Yes — he did escape then ; but I have n't done with him yet . He shall not get off so easy another time . "
407592	407605	407607	407608	the Buffer	29668	" I wonder who those chaps was that come up so sudden ? "
407614	407622	407624	407624	Tidkins	1061	" Friends of his , no doubt , "
407626	407675	407624	407624	Tidkins	1061	" Most likely he suspected a trap , or thought he would be on the right side . But the night was so plaguy dark , and the whole thing was so sudden , it was impossible to form an idea of who the two strangers might be . "
407676	407687	407689	407690	the Buffer	1077	" One on 'em was precious strong , I know , "
407692	407771	407689	407690	the Buffer	1077	" But , for my part , I think you 'd better leave the young feller alone in future . It 's no good standing the chance of getting scragged for mere wengeance . I ca n't understand that sort of thing . If you like to crack his crib for him and hive the swag , I 'm your man ; but I 'll have no more of a business that 's all danger and no profit . "
407772	407781	407783	407785	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Well , well , as you like , "
407789	407798	407783	407785	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Here we are ; so look alive . "
407867	407881	407883	407884	the Buffer	29668	" Are you sure you can find the way to the right grave ? "
407889	407895	407883	407884	the Buffer	29668	" Do n't be afraid , "
407900	407910	407883	407884	the Buffer	29668	" I could go straight up to it blindfold . "
407937	407947	407949	407950	the Buffer	29668	" I 'm afeard the ground 's precious hard , "
408022	408039	408041	408043	the Resurrection Man	3220	" We 'll soon turn it up , let it be as hard as it will , "
408150	408154	408155	408155	he	3220	" All right , "
408190	408198	408199	408199	he	3220	" Not so hard as you thought , "
408202	408231	408199	408199	he	3220	" The fact is , the whole burial - place is so mixed up with human remains , that the clay is too greasy to freeze very easy . "
408232	408239	408241	408242	the Buffer	29668	" I s'pose that 's it , "
408605	408612	408614	408614	Tidkins	1061	" So far , so good , "
408616	408651	408614	408614	Tidkins	1061	" it must be close upon one o'clock . We have got a quarter of an hour left — and that 's plenty of time to do all that 's yet to be done . "
408820	408829	408836	408836	he	3220	" The blunt is all safe , Jack , "
409014	409020	409022	409023	the undertaker	32765	" Got the blessed defunct ? "
409027	409032	409034	409035	the Buffer	29668	" Right and tight , "
409037	409055	409034	409035	the Buffer	29668	" and the tin too . Now , then , look sharp — here 's the tools . "
409056	409062	409064	409064	Banks	1300	" I 've got 'em , "
409066	409077	409079	409080	the Buffer	29668	" Look out for the stiff ' un , then , "
409301	409305	409307	409308	the undertaker	32765	" blessed defunct , "
409362	409364	409375	409376	the Buffer	29668	" reg'lars "
409552	409557	409559	409559	Tidkins	1061	" Now , Jack , "
409564	409605	409559	409559	Tidkins	1061	" do you take the stiff ' un out of the sack , and lay him along decently on the table ready for business , while I retire a moment to this gentleman 's study and settle accounts with him . "
409606	409611	409613	409614	the Buffer	29668	" Well and good , "
409616	409626	409627	409628	The surgeon	29781	" I 'll stay here till you come back . "
409731	409737	409738	409738	he	29668	" There , old feller , "
409741	409788	409738	409738	he	29668	" you 're comfortable , at any rate . What a blessin ' it would be to your friends , if they was ever to find out that you 'd been had up again , to know into what skilful hands you 'd happened to fall ! "
409813	409818	409819	409819	he	29668	" Let me see , "
409824	409906	409819	409819	he	29668	" there 's thirty - one pounds that was buried along with him , and then there 's ten pounds that the sawbones is a paying now to Tony for the snatch ; that makes forty - one pounds , and there 's three to go shares . What does that make ? Threes into four goes once — threes into eleven goes three and two over — that 's thirteen pounds a - piece , and two pound to split — "
409974	409977	409979	409980	the Buffer	1077	" Holloa ! "
409987	409992	409979	409980	the Buffer	1077	" what 's that ? "
410015	410019	410021	410022	the miscreant	28562	" O God ! "
410055	410063	410021	410022	the miscreant	28562	" James Tomlinson , Stock - broker . "
410504	410508	410509	410509	He	1005	" private office . "
410615	410621	410622	410622	he	11922	" Well , Mr. Tomlinson , "
410625	410661	410622	410622	he	11922	" on those conditions I will lend my name to the Irish Railway Company proposed . But , remember , I require fifty shares , and I am not to pay a farthing for them . "
410662	410668	410670	410670	Tomlinson	1005	" Oh , of course , "
410672	410741	410670	410670	Tomlinson	1005	" that is precisely the proposal I was instructed to make to you . The fact is , between you and me , the projectors are all men of straw — one came out of Whitecross Street Prison a few weeks ago , and another has been a bankrupt twice and an insolvent seven times ; and so they must raise heaven and earth to get good names . "
410742	410753	410755	410756	the gentleman	27107	" ' Tis their only plan — their only plan , "
410758	410764	410765	410765	he	27107	" and I flatter myself , "
410772	410787	410765	410765	he	27107	" that the countenance of Mr. Sheriff Popkins is not to be sneezed at . "
410788	410798	410800	410800	Tomlinson	1005	" On the contrary , my dear Mr. Popkins , "
410802	410813	410800	410800	Tomlinson	1005	" your name will soon bring a host of others . "
410814	410828	410765	410765	he	27107	" I should think so , Mr. Tomlinson — I should think so , "
410836	410865	410765	410765	he	27107	" Well , then , Mr. Popkins , shall I make an appointment for you to meet Messrs. Bubble and Chouse to - morrow morning at my office ? "
410866	411027	410765	410765	he	27107	" If you please , my dear sir . And now I wish you to do a little matter for me . The fact is , I have been fool enough to take thirty shares in a certain railway company , and I have been elected a director . The company is in a most flourishing condition , and so I mean to make them purchase my shares of me . You will accordingly have the kindness to let it be known on ' Change that you have my shares to sell ; but you must mind and not part with them . The thing will get to the company 's ears , and they will be terribly alarmed at the prospect of the injury which may be done to the enterprise by a director offering his shares for sale . They will then send and negotiate with you privately , and you can make a good bargain with them . "
411028	411032	411034	411034	Tomlinson	1005	" I understand , "
411036	411069	411034	411034	Tomlinson	1005	" I shall only breathe a whisper about the shares being offered for sale , in a quarter whence I know the rumour will immediately fly to the Directors of the Company . "
411070	411073	411075	411077	Mr. Sheriff Popkins	1312	" Good , "
411079	411107	411108	411110	The worthy sheriff	11925	" Here is the scrip : you can tell me what you have done when I call to - morrow morning to meet Messrs. Bubble and Chouse . "
411121	411125	411127	411128	this gentleman	2368	" Mr. Tomlinson , "
411130	411156	411127	411128	this gentleman	2368	" I wish you to do your best for a new Joint Stock - Company which I have just founded . This is the prospectus . "
411173	411293	411157	411160	The stock - broker	4179	" Ah ! very good indeed — excellent ! ' British Marble Company . ' Famous idea ! ' Capital Two Hundred Thousand Pounds in Ten Thousand Shares of Twenty Pounds Each . ' Good again . ' Deposit One Pound per Share . ' That will do . Then comes the Board of Directors — all good names . I see you have made yourself Managing Director : well , that 's quite fair ! Then , again , ' Auditor , Mr. Alderman Sniff ; Treasurer , Mr. Alderman Sniff ; Secretary , Mr. Alderman Sniff . ' But who sells the quarry to the Company ? Oh ! I see , ' Mr. Alderman Sniff . ' "
411294	411304	411306	411307	the alderman	4208	" Well , what do you think of it ? "
411309	411319	411306	411307	the alderman	4208	" You ask me candidly , my dear sir ? "
411320	411323	411325	411326	the alderman	4208	" Certainly , "
411328	411350	411325	411326	the alderman	4208	" I think the plan is excellent . The only drawback to its success , is — shall I speak openly ? "
411351	411359	411306	411307	the alderman	4208	" I wish you to do so . "
411360	411375	411377	411377	Tomlinson	1005	" Then I am of opinion that you have given yourself too many situations , "
411379	411452	411377	411377	Tomlinson	1005	" In the first place you found the Company , and you make yourself Managing Director . Well and good . But then you also sell the quarry to the Company . Now , as Managing Director , you have to award to yourself a sum for that quarry ; as Treasurer you pay yourself ; as Secretary you draw up the agreements ; and as Auditor you confirm your own accounts ! "
411453	411480	411306	411307	the alderman	4208	" Perfectly correct , Mr. Tomlinson . Is it not a rule that Joint - Stock Companies are never to benefit any one save the founder ? "
411481	411489	411491	411494	the stock - broker	4179	" Oh ! no one denies that , "
411496	411524	411491	411494	the stock - broker	4179	" What I am afraid of is , that the public will not bite , when they see one man occupying so many situations in the Company . "
411525	411564	411306	411307	the alderman	4208	" Nonsense , my dear fellow ! The name of an alderman will carry every thing before it . Does not the world believe that the Aldermen of the City of London are all as rich as Crœsus ? "
411565	411573	411575	411575	Tomlinson	1005	" Whereas , between you and me , "
411581	411602	411575	411575	Tomlinson	1005	" there is scarcely one of them who has got a penny if his affairs came to be wound up . "
411603	411614	411616	411618	Mr. Alderman Sniff	1315	" And yet we live gloriously , ha ! ha ! "
411620	411635	411616	411618	Mr. Alderman Sniff	1315	" But to return to my business : what can you do for me ? "
411636	411644	411646	411646	Tomlinson	1005	" I can certainly recommend the enterprise , "
411648	411657	411646	411646	Tomlinson	1005	" But where can the marble be seen ? "
411658	411663	411665	411666	the alderman	4208	" At my office , "
411668	411707	411665	411666	the alderman	4208	" I went and bought the finest piece that was ever imported from Italy ; and there it is in my counting - house , labelled ' British Marble ' in letters at least half a foot high . "
411708	411715	411717	411717	Tomlinson	1005	" Where is the quarry situated ? "
411719	411734	411717	411717	Tomlinson	1005	" Oh ! I have n't quite made up my mind about that yet , "
411744	411787	411740	411742	Mr. Alderman Sniff	1315	" The truth is , I am going down into Wales this week , and I shall buy the first field I can get cheap in some rude part of the country . That is the least difficulty in the whole enterprise . "
411788	411798	411800	411800	Tomlinson	1005	" Your plans are admirable , my dear sir , "
411802	411823	411800	411800	Tomlinson	1005	" I will do all I can for you . Will you take a glass of wine and a biscuit ? "
411824	411834	411836	411837	the Alderman	4208	" No , I thank you — not now , "
411839	411890	411836	411837	the Alderman	4208	" I have promised a colleague to sit for him to - day at Guildhall police - court . Last week I was on the rota for attendance there , and I remanded a man who was brought up on a charge of obtaining three and sixpence under false pretences . "
411891	411894	411896	411896	Tomlinson	1005	" Indeed ? "
411904	411909	411800	411800	Tomlinson	1005	" Two Hundred Thousand Pounds "
411916	411919	411921	411922	Mr. Sniff	1315	" Yes , "
411924	411993	411994	411994	he	1315	" and I am going to sit to - day because that fellow comes up again . I mean to clear the City of all such rogues and vagabonds . I shall give him a taste of the treadmill for two months . So , good morning . By the by , call as you pass my office and have a look at the marble ; and mind , "
412001	412021	411998	411998	his	1315	" you do n't let out that it came from Italy . It is pure Welsh marble , remember ! "
412071	412083	412085	412086	the capitalist	33389	" My dear Tomlinson , I am delighted to see you , "
412088	412111	412085	412086	the capitalist	33389	" It is really an age — a week at least — since I saw you . How do matters get on ? "
412112	412122	412124	412124	Tomlinson	1005	" I have prospects of doing an excellent business , "
412126	412170	412124	412124	Tomlinson	1005	" The numberless bubble companies that are started every day , are the making of us stock - brokers . We dispose of shares or effect transfers , and obtain our commission , let the result be what it may to the purchasers . "
412171	412199	412201	412201	Greenwood	903	" And I hope that you have conquered those ridiculous qualms of conscience which always made a coward of you , when you were in Lombard Street ? "
412203	412211	412213	412213	Tomlinson	1005	" Needs must when the devil drives , "
412216	412221	412223	412223	Greenwood	903	" For my part , "
412225	412400	412223	412223	Greenwood	903	" I take advantage of this mania on the part of the English for speculation in joint - stock companies and railway shares . A day of reaction will come ; and the effects will be fearful . Thousands and thousands of families will be involved in irretrievable ruin . That day may not occur for one year — two years — five years — or even ten years;—but come it will ; and the signal for it will be when the House of Commons is inundated with railway and joint - stock company business , and when it is compelled to postpone a portion of that business until the ensuing session . Then confidence will receive a shock : an interval for calm meditation will occur ; and the result will be awful . Every one will be anxious to sell shares , and there will be no buyers . Now mark my words , Tomlinson ; and , if you speculate on your own account , speculate accordingly . I do so . "
412401	412414	412416	412416	Tomlinson	1005	" And you are not likely to go wrong , I know , "
412418	412445	412416	412416	Tomlinson	1005	" But stock - brokers do not risk any money of their own : they have plenty of clients , who will do that for them . "
412446	412453	412455	412455	Greenwood	903	" Then you are really thriving ? "
412457	412495	412455	412455	Greenwood	903	" I am earning a living , and my business is increasing . But I feel hanging like a mill - stone round my neck the thousand pounds which you lent me at twenty per cent . — "
412496	412504	412416	412416	Tomlinson	1005	" Yes — only twenty per cent . "
412505	412513	412515	412515	Tomlinson	1005	" Only at twenty per cent . , "
412520	412547	412515	412515	Tomlinson	1005	" and I am unable to return you more than one hundred at present , although I agreed to pay you two hundred every four months . "
412548	412554	412556	412556	Greenwood	903	" The hundred will do , "
412587	412601	412603	412604	the capitalist	33389	" There is a pretty business to be done in the City now , "
412610	412671	412603	412604	the capitalist	33389	" I contrive to snatch an hour or two now and then from the time which I am compelled to devote to the enlightened and independent body that returned me to Parliament ; and I seldom come into the City on those occasions without lending a few hundreds to some poor devil who has over - bought himself in shares . "
412672	412683	412685	412688	the stock - broker	4179	" I have no doubt that you thrive , Greenwood , "
412690	412705	412685	412688	the stock - broker	4179	" Every man who takes advantage of the miseries of others must get on . "
412706	412715	412717	412720	the Member of Parliament	8234	" To be sure — to be sure , "
412722	412733	412717	412720	the Member of Parliament	8234	" I hope that you will act upon that principle . "
412734	412789	412603	412604	the capitalist	33389	" I have no reason to complain of the business that I am now doing : I act as honestly as I can — and that principle deprives me of many advantageous affairs . Then I experience annoyance from a constant reminiscence of that poor old man who so nobly sacrificed himself for me . "
412790	412795	412797	412797	Greenwood	903	" The eternal cry ! "
412799	412818	412797	412797	Greenwood	903	" If you are so very anxious to find him out , put an advertisement in the Times — "
412819	412859	412603	412604	the capitalist	33389	" And if he saw it , he would believe it to be a stratagem of the police to arrest him . You know that there is a warrant out against him . The official assignee took that step . "
412860	412911	412603	412604	the capitalist	33389	" Well , let him take his chance ; and if he should happen to be captured , we will petition the Home Secretary to diminish the period for which he will be sentenced to transportation . Not that such a step would benefit him much , because his age — "
412912	412921	412923	412923	Tomlinson	1005	" Let us drop this subject , Greenwood , "
412928	412970	412923	412923	Tomlinson	1005	" With all my heart . I must admit that it moves one 's feelings ; and if I met the old man in the street , I should not hesitate to give him a guinea out of my own pocket . "
412971	412975	412977	412977	Tomlinson	1005	" A guinea ! "
412988	413016	412985	412985	his	1005	" Perhaps you would recommend me to bestow a five - pound note upon that poor Italian nobleman whom you cheated out of his fifteen thousand pounds . "
413017	413027	413029	413029	Greenwood	903	" You need not call him a poor nobleman , "
413031	413043	413029	413029	Greenwood	903	" He is now worth ten thousand pounds a - year . "
413044	413061	413063	413063	Tomlinson	1005	" Indeed ! A great change must have taken place , then , in his fortunes ? "
413065	413086	413088	413088	Greenwood	903	" The fact , in a few words , is this . A young lady , whom I knew well , "
413090	413140	413088	413088	Greenwood	903	" obtained letters of introduction from Count Alteroni to certain friends of his in Montoni , the capital of Castelcicala , to which state she repaired for the benefit of her health , or some such frivolous reason . She had the good fortune to captivate the Grand Duke — "
413141	413149	413151	413151	Tomlinson	1005	" Miss Eliza Sydney , you mean ? "
413153	413162	413151	413151	Tomlinson	1005	" The same . Did you know her ? "
413163	413185	413029	413029	Greenwood	903	" Not at all . But I read in the newspapers the account of her marriage with Angelo III . Proceed . "
413186	413237	413088	413088	Greenwood	903	" The moment she married the Grand Duke , a pension of ten thousand a - year was granted to Count Alteroni , by way of indemnification , I have heard , for his estates , which were confiscated after he had fled the country in consequence of political intrigues . "
413238	413246	413346	413346	he	903	" How did you learn all this ? "
413247	413288	413029	413029	Greenwood	903	" My valet Filippo happens to be a native of Montoni , and he seems well acquainted with all that passes in Castelcicala . Count Alteroni and his family have returned to the villa which they formerly inhabited at Richmond . "
413289	413323	413029	413029	Greenwood	903	" I am delighted to hear this good news . You have taken a considerable weight off my mind ; the transaction with that nobleman was always a subject of self - reproach . "
413324	413329	413331	413332	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I dare say , "
413349	413415	413346	413346	he	903	" You are no doubt the most punctilious and conscientious of all City men . I have something to communicate to you , and must do it briefly , as I am compelled to return to Spring Gardens , to meet a deputation from the Rottenborough Agricultural Society , at one o'clock precisely — and I never keep such people waiting more than an hour ! "
413416	413424	413426	413429	the stock - broker	4179	" That is considerate on your part , "
413431	413480	413482	413482	Greenwood	903	" Do n't you think it is ? But I did not come here for the sole purpose of chatting . The fact is , a gentleman with whom I am acquainted wants a stock - broker for a very delicate and important business — for a business , "
413491	413528	413485	413485	his	903	" which requires a man who will be content to put five hundred pounds into his pocket for the service that will be required of him , and perform that service blindfold , as it were . "
413529	413539	413541	413541	Tomlinson	1005	" I will do nothing to compromise my safety , "
413543	413553	413555	413555	Greenwood	903	" You will not be required to do so , "
413557	413597	413555	413555	Greenwood	903	" However , the gentleman I allude to will call upon you in the course of the day , I dare say ; and he will then explain to you the service he has to demand at your hands . "
413598	413607	413609	413609	Tomlinson	1005	" What is the name of your friend ? "
413611	413618	413609	413609	Tomlinson	1005	" Mr. Chichester — Arthur Chichester , "
413623	413628	413630	413633	the stock - broker	4179	" Chichester — Chichester , "
413637	413679	413630	413633	the stock - broker	4179	" surely I have heard you mention that name before ? Ah ! now I remember ! Did you not complain to me a few days ago that he had been making mischief between you and a certain Sir Rupert Harborough ? "
413680	413684	413686	413686	Greenwood	903	" I did , "
413688	413795	413686	413686	Greenwood	903	" and I certainly had good cause for anger against this same Arthur Chichester . But I had become his confidant and adviser in a certain affair a few weeks before I discovered that he had acquainted Sir Rupert Harborough with circumstances which he had better have kept to himself ; and I am therefore compelled to continue my assistance and counsel to him until the affair alluded to be brought to a successful termination . Besides , as Sir Rupert and I have settled our little differences , there is no use in bearing malice , especially when something is to be gained by forbearance . "
413796	413805	413807	413807	Tomlinson	1005	" I thought you would make that admission , "
413811	413849	413807	413807	Tomlinson	1005	" Well , I shall see your friend , and if , with safety , I can earn five hundred pounds , certainly , in my position , I can not afford to lose such an opportunity . "
413850	413859	413861	413861	Greenwood	903	" That is speaking like a reasonable man , "
413863	413975	413861	413861	Greenwood	903	" Never stick at trifles . What should I be now , if I had hesitated at every step I took ? Should I possess a hundred thousand pounds in good securities ? should I be enabled to gratify every wish , caprice , or desire , whose object money can accomplish ? should I be the representative of one of the most independent and intelligent constituencies in England ? Ah , my dear fellow , think of me and my position when you hesitate ; and always make money after the well - authorised system — honestly , if you can ; but , at all events , make money . "
413986	413989	413991	413991	Tomlinson	1005	" Yes , "
414000	414197	413991	413991	Tomlinson	1005	" that man is right ! Make money , honestly , if you can ; but , at all events , make money . That is the burden of his song ; why should it not be the chorus of mine ? When I look around me , I see every one making money upon the same plan . Sheriff Popkins does not hesitate to lend his name to a bubble ; and Alderman Spiff concocts one ! And they are men of reputation — holding important offices — appearing at Court — wielding power — exercising influence . This is indeed a wide field for contemplation . Why , Greenwood , in his bold , dashing manner , gains more in a day than I , in my miserable , droning fashion , earn in a month . To be afraid to touch the gold that is thrown in one 's way in this wonderful city , is to be a coward — a very coward . Yes — I see it all ! Greenwood is right . Make money — honestly , if you can ; but , at all events , make money ! "
414241	414247	414249	414249	Tomlinson	1005	" Show Mr. Chichester in , "
414302	414319	414299	414299	he	886	" I presume our mutual friend Greenwood has mentioned my name to you , Mr. Tomlinson ? "
414320	414331	414299	414299	he	886	" He has . I was prepared for your visit . "
414332	414341	414343	414343	Chichester	886	" But not for its object , perhaps ? "
414345	414355	414343	414343	Chichester	886	" I am as yet ignorant on that head , "
414360	414368	414343	414343	Chichester	886	" Mr. Greenwood then told you nothing — "
414369	414398	414299	414299	he	886	" Nothing , save an intimation that my services were required in a certain delicate and important matter , and that five hundred pounds would be my remuneration . "
414399	414403	414405	414406	Mr. Chichester	886	" Perfectly correct , "
414408	414420	414405	414406	Mr. Chichester	886	" Are you disposed to aid me on the proposed terms ? "
414421	414438	414299	414299	he	886	" I must first learn the nature of the business in which my interference is needed . "
414439	414447	414405	414406	Mr. Chichester	886	" And if you should then decline ? "
414448	414468	414405	414406	Mr. Chichester	886	" You shall have my solemn assurance that what you confide to me remains buried in my own bosom . "
414469	414479	414481	414481	Chichester	886	" That is what I call a proper understanding , "
414483	415453	414481	414481	Chichester	886	" You must know , then , that some three months ago I wooed , and won , a widow lady , not very ugly , certainly , but whose principal attraction consisted of the sum of sixteen thousand pounds in the three and a half per cents . She was five and twenty years of age , and possessed of a sweet little house in the neighbourhood of the Cambridge Heath gate . I met her one evening in July or August last at a party at my father 's house — when I was doing the amiable to the old gentleman in order to sound his pockets ; and my father whispered to me that I ought to make up to Mrs. Higgins . Certainly the name was not very aristocratic ; but then her Christian name was Viola ; and I thought that Viola Chichester would be pretty enough . I accordingly flirted with the widow on that occasion , and we seemed tolerably pleased with each other . I called next day — and every now and then , when I had time ; but I , really , scarcely entertained serious thoughts of making her an offer , until one day when I was desperately hard up , and I saw my friend Harborough involved in such difficulties that we could not do any good together . So I got into an omnibus in Bishopsgate Street , went down to Cambridge Heath , called upon Mrs. Higgins , and then and there offered her my heart and hand . She accepted me . We had a pleasant little chat about money matters : she stated that her late husband , a wealthy builder , had left her sixteen thousand pounds ; and , of course , I could not make myself out a pauper . Besides , she knew that father was tolerably well off . I assured her that I was possessed of a few thousands , and that the old gentleman allowed me three hundred a - year into the bargain . She stipulated that all her own money should be settled upon herself . I demurred to this proposal ; but she was obstinate ; and I then discovered that Mrs. Viola Higgins had a very determined will and a very positive temper of her own . I thought to myself , ' Here is a charming widow who throws herself into my arms , and who possesses a decent fortune ; it would be madness to neglect so golden an opportunity of enriching myself . Besides , ' I reasoned , ' when once we are married , it will be very easy for me to wheedle the affectionate creature out of any money that I may require . ' Well , I consented to the settlement of all her property upon herself ; and in due course we were married . I did not mention the matter to any of my West - End friends , because I did not like to invite them to the wedding — I was afraid their off - hand manners would alarm the bride , and give her an unfavourable opinion with regard to myself . So the business was kept very snug and quiet ; and we passed the honey - moon at my wife 's sister and brother - in - law 's , very decent people in their way , and dwelling at Stratford - le - Bow . On our return to London , I thought it time to break the ice in respect to my own pecuniary situation . The truth was , that I had not a penny - piece of my own , and that my father had long since withdrawn his support , in consequence of the immense drains I had made upon his purse . I was moreover encumbered with debts ; and some of my tradesmen had found me out and began to call at the house at Cambridge Heath . They even used menaces . My position was truly critical . I did not marry the widow merely with a view to take her out for a walk , sit by the fire - side chatting , or read a book while she worked . I wanted money,—money to pay my debts,—money to enjoy myself with . Accordingly I broke the ice by very candidly avowing that I had not a shilling . I , however , swore that her beauty and accomplishments had alone induced me thus to deceive her . But — oh ! the vixen ! She flew into such a passion that I thought she would tear my eyes out . She raved and wept — and wept and raved — and then reproached and taunted,—until I wished one of us at the devil , and scarcely cared which went there . The scene ended in Viola 's falling into a fit of hysterics ; and she was compelled to go to bed . I was most assiduous to her ; and my attentions evidently softened her . In a few hours she grew calm , and then said , ' Arthur , you have deceived me grossly ; but I can forgive you . I do not regret the loss of the wealth and income which you led me to believe were yours ; I am only sorry that you should have thought it necessary to practise such a measure to induce me to marry you . But let what is past be forgotten . The income derived from my property is sufficient for us ; and , if you will be kind and good to me , this deception shall never more trouble our happiness . ' "
415454	415472	415474	415474	Tomlinson	1005	" I think Mrs. Chichester spoke like a generous , sensible , and noble - hearted woman , "
415504	415507	415509	415510	that gentleman	3618	" Ahem ! "
415523	415538	415539	415539	he	3618	" However , all that fine feeling was mere outward show with my wife , "
415542	416099	415539	415539	he	3618	" for she was inexorable in her refusal to sell out or mortgage any of her funded property for my use . I told her that I had debts . ' Give a list to my solicitor , ' she said , ' and he shall compromise with your creditors . ' I assured her that I could make a better bargain with them myself . She would not believe me . I then declared point - blank that I did not mean to remain tied to her apron - strings ; that she must at least settle half the property upon me ; that I desired to keep a horse and cab , and introduce my friends to my wife ; and that I was resolved we should live as people of property ought to live . It was then that she showed her inveterate obstinacy , and manifested the worst shades of an infamous temper . She agreed to allow me one hundred a - year for my clothes and pocket - money , but would not give me any control over her property . As for horses , cabs , and West End friends , she ridiculed the idea . I prayed , threatened , and reasoned by turns : she was as immoveable as Mount Atlas . Several days were passed in perpetual arguments upon the subject ; but the more I prayed , threatened , and reasoned , the more obstinate she grew . One morning we had a desperate quarrel . I swore that I would be revenged — that I would extort from her by violence , or other means , what she refused to yield to argument . Nothing , however , could move her : she said that she would not ruin herself to gratify my extravagances . This was nearly a month ago . I bounced out of the house , and hurried up to the West End of the town , as fast as I could go , to see and consult my friend Sir Rupert Harborough . But , as I was on my way thither — for I actually had not even money in my pocket to pay a cab — I accidentally met Greenwood . He saw that I was annoyed and vexed , and inquired the reason . I told him all . He reflected for some moments , and then said , ' Do not consult Harborough in this matter . He can not assist you . There is only one course to adopt with such a woman as this . You must put her under restraint . ' I told him that nothing would please me better ; but that I should have all her friends upon me if I threw her into a lunatic asylum ; and that I was , moreover , without the means to take a single step . Greenwood and I went into a tavern , and discussed the business over a bottle of wine . He then laid down a certain plan , made certain stipulations respecting remuneration for himself , and offered to back me in carrying the matter to the extreme . Of course I assented to all he proposed . The whole affair was managed in such a manner as — "
416100	416109	416111	416111	Tomlinson	1005	" As none but Greenwood could manage it , "
416113	416116	416118	416118	Chichester	886	" Exactly , "
416120	416180	416118	416118	Chichester	886	" Indeed , he is a thorough man of business ! He procured two surgeons to call , at separate times , at the house at Cambridge Heath , ostensibly to see me . I took care to be at home . They also saw my wife ; and the result was that they granted the certificates I required . "
416181	416190	416192	416192	Tomlinson	1005	" Certificates of an unsound state of mind ? "
416194	416203	416205	416205	Chichester	886	" Certificates of an unsound state of mind , "
416209	416453	416205	416205	Chichester	886	" Greenwood managed it all — keeping himself , however , entirely in the back - ground . He found the surgeons — provided me with money to fee them — and then recommended to me a keeper of a lunatic asylum , who is not over particular . These proceedings occupied two or three days , during which I was on my very best behaviour with my wife ; but if ever I hinted to her the propriety of acceding to my wishes in respect to the disposal of her property , she cut me short by the assurance that her decision was irrevocable . I really wished to avoid extreme measures ; but with such a disobedient , self - willed , obstinate woman , leniency was an impossibility . Accordingly , I one evening allured her , during a walk , into the immediate vicinity of the lunatic asylum : the streets were lonely and deserted ; and it was already dark . The keeper of the mad - house had been prepared for the execution of the project that evening ; and he was at his post . As we slowly passed by his house , he sprang forward from some recess or dark nook , and fixed a plaster over my wife 's mouth . Thus not a cry could escape her lips . At the same moment we seized her , and conveyed her into the asylum . "
416454	416461	416463	416463	Tomlinson	1005	" That was three weeks ago ? "
416470	416481	416465	416465	Chichester	886	" And she has not come to her senses yet ? "
416482	416488	416205	416205	Chichester	886	" She has at length , "
416493	416568	416205	416205	Chichester	886	" I received a letter yesterday from the keeper of the asylum , stating that her spirit is broken , and that she is now ready to obey her husband in all things . The keeper wrote to me a few days ago to state that his mode of cure was producing a favourable result ; and yesterday he intimated to me by another letter that the mode alluded to had proved completely successful . "
416569	416579	416581	416581	Tomlinson	1005	" What course do you now intend to pursue ? "
416599	416613	416615	416615	Chichester	886	" I immediately communicated the important contents of this second letter to Greenwood , "
416617	416688	416615	416615	Chichester	886	" and he recommended me to apply to you to aid me in completing the business . My wife now sees her folly , and is willing to devote one half of her property — namely , eight thousand pounds , to the use and purposes of her lawful husband ; and I am generous enough to be satisfied with that sum , instead of insisting upon having the whole . "
416689	416694	416696	416696	Tomlinson	1005	" I understand you , "
416698	416724	416696	416696	Tomlinson	1005	" you require a stock - broker to effect the transfer of eight thousand pounds from the name of your wife into your own name . "
416725	416736	416738	416738	Chichester	886	" And to sell out the amount when so transferred , "
416740	416759	416761	416761	Tomlinson	1005	" It will be necessary for me to obtain the signature of your wife to a certain paper , "
416763	416793	416761	416761	Tomlinson	1005	" Greenwood has told me all this . In one word , will you accompany me to the asylum where my wife is confined , and obtain her signature ? "
416794	416816	416818	416818	Tomlinson	1005	" If she be willing to give it , I am willing to receive it — as a matter of business , "
416820	416869	416818	416818	Tomlinson	1005	" But , are you sure — in a word , what guarantee have you that she will not denounce the whole proceeding to the officers of justice — rally her friends around her — appeal to the law — and punish every one concerned in the business ? "
416870	417248	416761	416761	Tomlinson	1005	" Listen . The document which she agrees to sign is a general power on my behalf over eight thousand pounds in the Bank of England : this power will be dated two months back — a month after our marriage . We must be supposed to have called at your office on a particular day at that period , on which occasion she signed the power in your presence . It being a general power of transfer , it would not seem extraordinary that I did not use it until now — that is , two months after it was given . This night must she sign the deed : to - morrow you must transfer and sell out the money . Then to - morrow night , she shall be conveyed back to the house at Cambridge Heath . The two servants whom we keep are bribed to my interest : they are ready , in case of need , to prove the existence of those symptoms of insanity which justified the certificates of the surgeons and the restraint under which my wife has been placed . How , then , can she do us an injury ? If she proclaim her ' wrongs'—as she may call them , you can prove that the power of transfer could not have been extorted from her in a mad - house , as it was signed two months ago at your office ! Then , if she were to speak of the mode of treatment adopted by the keeper of that mad - house to curb her haughty spirit , the accusation would be indignantly denied ; and her statements would be set down to a disordered imagination , and would justify further restraint . Be you well assured , that she will never say or do any thing that may endanger her liberty again ! No — the fact is simply this : we divide the property , and separate for ever . She will be glad to get rid of a husband like me : I shall not be sorry to dissolve — as far as we can dissolve it — a connexion with a woman of her mean , griping , and avaricious disposition . "
417249	417257	417259	417259	Tomlinson	1005	" This is Greenwood 's scheme throughout , "
417261	417283	417259	417259	Tomlinson	1005	" No other man living could plot such admirable combinations to effect a certain object , without danger to any one . "
417284	417319	416761	416761	Tomlinson	1005	" Do you consent to act in this matter , on consideration of retaining for yourself five hundred pounds of the money which you will have to transfer and sell out to - morrow ? "
417320	417325	417327	417327	Tomlinson	1005	" I do consent , "
417343	417362	417338	417338	he	1005	" Make money — honestly , if you can ; but , at all events , make money . "
417363	417384	417386	417386	Chichester	886	" To - night — at ten o'clock , will you come to me at my house at Cambridge Heath ? "
417388	417392	416761	416761	Tomlinson	1005	" I will , "
417397	417421	416761	416761	Tomlinson	1005	" But let me ask you one question:—what excuse have you made to your wife 's friends for this absence of three weeks ? "
417422	417428	417430	417430	Chichester	886	" In the first place , "
417432	417536	417430	417430	Chichester	886	" her only relations consist of a sister and this sister 's husband at Stratford - le - Bow ; and they are so immersed in the cares of business , that they have not called once at Cambridge Heath ever since our marriage . Secondly , my wife always lived in a very retired manner , and has very few acquaintances or friends besides my father 's family . It was therefore easy to satisfy the one or two persons who did call , with the excuse that Mrs. Chichester had gone on a short visit to some relatives in the country . "
417537	417561	417563	417563	Tomlinson	1005	" And you feel convinced your precautions are so wisely taken , that she will never open her lips relative to the past ? "
417565	417590	417592	417592	Chichester	1319	" I am confident that she will not breathe a word that may lead to her return to the place where she now is , "
417604	417617	417619	417619	Tomlinson	1005	" Then I will not hesitate to serve you in this business , "
417621	417630	417619	417619	Tomlinson	1005	" To - night — at ten o'clock . "
417631	417640	417642	417642	Chichester	1319	" To - night — at ten o'clock , "
417665	417680	417681	417681	he	1005	" The die is cast — I am now about to plunge into crime ! "
417684	417803	417804	417804	Tomlinson	1005	" And yet how could I avoid — how could I long procrastinate this step ? These mean tricks — these dishonourable dealings — these deceptive schemes in which we brokers are compelled to bear a part , only serve to prepare the way for more daring and more criminal pursuits . Five hundred pounds at one stroke ! That is a little fortune to a man , struggling against the world , like me ! Four hundred will I pay to Greenwood — the other hundred will swell my little account at the bankers ' ; for who can hope to do any extent of business in this city without a good name at his bankers ' ? "
417849	417870	417839	417840	The clerk	2971	" Sir , there is a person , who refuses to give his name , waiting to speak to you . "
417871	417877	417879	417879	Tomlinson	1005	" Let him come in , "
417908	417914	417916	417919	the stock - broker	4179	" Your business , sir ? "
417932	417938	417940	417941	the man	2092	" Your name 's Tomlinson ? "
417948	417957	417940	417941	the man	2092	" Yes . What would you with me ? "
417958	417962	417964	417965	the man	2092	" James Tomlinson , "
417982	417989	417975	417975	he	2092	" late banker in Lombard Street ? "
417990	417994	417996	417996	Tomlinson	1005	" The same , "
418000	418018	418020	418021	the man	2092	" Then I took it down right , although he did speak in such a confused manner , "
418032	418038	418040	418043	the stock - broker	4179	" What do you mean ? "
418045	418059	418061	418062	the stranger	2298	" I mean that there 's a person who wants to see you , "
418064	418115	418061	418062	the stranger	2298	" I do n't know that I 'm exactly right in saying wants , because he is in such a state that he can neither want nor care about any thing . At the same time , I think it would be as well if you was to see him . "
418116	418122	418124	418124	Tomlinson	1005	" Who is this person ? "
418126	418144	418124	418124	Tomlinson	1005	" A man that seems to know you well enough , if I can understand his ravings . "
418145	418148	418150	418153	the stock - broker	4179	" Ravings ! "
418162	418216	418150	418153	the stock - broker	4179	" Ravings , indeed ! and enough to make him rave ! To be laid out as dead for four days , then put in a coffin , buried , and be had up again within ten or a dozen hours:—if that would n't make a man rave — what the devil would ? "
418217	418235	418124	418124	Tomlinson	1005	" Have the goodness to explain yourself . Every word you utter is an enigma to me . "
418236	418275	418124	418124	Tomlinson	1005	" But it was n't an enigma to my poor friend when the stiff ' un suddenly put a cold hand upon his . However , in two words , do you know a person called Michael Martin ? "
418276	418280	418282	418285	the stock - broker	4179	" Michael Martin ! "
418287	418296	418282	418285	the stock - broker	4179	" Speak — what has become of him ? "
418297	418303	418124	418124	Tomlinson	1005	" He has been ill — "
418304	418318	418124	418124	Tomlinson	1005	" Ill ! poor old man ! and I not to know it ! "
418319	418327	418124	418124	Tomlinson	1005	" Worse than that ! He died — "
418328	418335	418124	418124	Tomlinson	1005	" Died ! Where — when ? "
418336	418343	418124	418124	Tomlinson	1005	" Died — and was buried . "
418344	418360	418124	418124	Tomlinson	1005	" Trifle not with me . When did he die ? where is he buried ? "
418361	418374	418376	418377	the stranger	2298	" He died — was buried — and came to life again ! "
418385	418388	418390	418390	Tomlinson	1005	" Sir , "
418406	418424	418390	418390	Tomlinson	1005	" if you have called to tell me any thing concerning Michael Martin , speak without mystification . "
418425	418430	418432	418433	the stranger	2298	" Well , sir , "
418435	418752	418432	418433	the stranger	2298	" the plain truth is this:—An old man , without a name , took up his abode in a by - street in Globe Town some months ago . He was taken ill , and , to all appearance , died . He was buried . A surgeon fancied him as a subject , and hired me and a friend of mine to have him up again . We resurrectionized him , and took him in a cart last night to the surgeon 's house . He was conveyed into the dissecting - room , and stretched on the table . The doctor and I went into the surgery to settle the expenses ; and , in the mean time , my friend was left alone with the stiff ' un . It seems that a neighbour , suspecting that the surgeon now and then got a subject for his experiments , saw the cart stop at the door , and immediately understood what was going on . He went into his garden , which joins the yard where the dissecting - house stands , and seeing a light in the window of the dissecting - house , he felt sure that his suspicions were well founded , although he could not see into the place , because there was a dark blind drawn down over the window . However , the neighbour was resolved to clear up his doubts ; so he took up a brick - bat , and threw it as hard as he could against the window . The glass was broken , and the light extinguished . My friend , who was left alone with the stiff ' un , was somewhat startled at this occurrence ; but how much more was he alarmed when he suddenly felt the body stretch out its hand and catch hold of one of his ? "
418753	418761	418763	418763	Tomlinson	1005	" Then Michael Martin was not dead ? "
418816	418857	418869	418869	Tomlinson	1005	" No — the old man is not dead . The doctor and myself were in the surgery , when we heard the smash of the window and the cry of the Buf — of my friend , I mean . "
418858	418867	418869	418869	Tomlinson	1005	" Of your brother resurrectionist , I suppose , "
418878	418884	418869	418869	Tomlinson	1005	" Well , go on . "
418885	419111	418869	418869	Tomlinson	1005	" We went into the dissecting - room with a lamp , and there we found the light put out , and my comrade insensible on the floor . But what was more extraordinary still , we saw the corpse gasping for breath . ' He is not dead ! ' cried the surgeon ; and in a moment a lancet was stuck into his arm . The blood would not flow at first , but the surgeon chafed his temples and hands by turns ; and in a few moments the blood trickled out pretty freely . Meantime I had recovered my companion , and explained to him the nature of the phenomenon that had taken place . When he heard the real truth , he was no longer alarmed , because he knew very well that people are often buried in a trance . In fact , one night , about eighteen months ago , he and I went to Old Saint Pancras church - yard to get up a stiff ' un , and when we opened the coffin , we found that the body had turned completely round on its face ; it was , however , stone dead when we got it up — and never shall I forget what a countenance it had ! But of that no matter . "
419112	419123	419125	419125	Tomlinson	1005	" Have the goodness to keep to your present narrative , "
419146	419149	419151	419156	the man with the cadaverous countenance	34766	" Well , "
419158	419373	419151	419156	the man with the cadaverous countenance	34766	" in a very few minutes we completely recovered the old gentleman . I obeyed all the directions of the surgeon , and ran backwards and forwards to the pharmacy for God only knows what salts and what ammonia . At last the subject gave a terrible groan , opened his eyes , and exclaimed , ' Where am I ? ' The surgeon assured him that he was in safety — that he had been very ill — that he was now much better — and so on . Meantime , by the surgeon 's orders , I had called up his housekeeper , ( for he is a bachelor , ) and she had got a bed prepared and warmed , and some hot water ready , and every thing comfortable . Well , we carried the old gentleman up to bed ; the doctor gave him a little warm brandy and water ; and in another half hour , he was able to speak a few words in a comprehensible manner . But his brain seemed confused , and all we could learn was that his name was ' Michael Martin , ' and that he raved after a gentleman , whom he called ' James Tomlinson , the banker . ' "
419374	419384	419386	419386	Tomlinson	1005	" Ah ! he said that — did he ? "
419398	419402	419151	419156	the man with the cadaverous countenance	34766	" He did , "
419407	419436	419438	419439	the man	2092	" And then we began to think that we had heard those names before ; and , in a few minutes , I — who know every thing , "
419457	419459	419460	419460	he	2092	leer,—"I , "
419463	419487	419460	419460	he	2092	" remembered that Michael Martin was the man who had been the cashier in the bank of Tomlinson and Company , Lombard Street . "
419488	419497	419499	419502	the stock - broker	4179	" But did he say — did he — "
419506	419509	419460	419460	he	2092	breath,—"did he — "
419510	419542	419460	419460	he	2092	" He raved — he grew delirious ; and in his wanderings , he said enough to prove that he was not guilty of the breach of trust imputed to him . "
419543	419557	419559	419559	Tomlinson	1005	" O God ! thy vengeance overtakes me , then , at last ! "
419571	419579	419581	419591	the man whose revelations had thus produced so strange an effect	11976	" He said much — very much , "
419596	419658	419581	419591	the man whose revelations had thus produced so strange an effect	11976	" But do not alarm yourself — I am not one to peach ; and the doctor himself is not likely to say any thing that night lead to an awkward inquiry into the circumstances that brought the old gentleman into his house . Remember , the law now punishes with transportation those who resurrectionize , and those who encourage resurrectionists . "
419659	419667	419669	419669	Tomlinson	1005	" Then you will not betray me ? "
419679	419683	419685	419686	the man	2092	" Betray you ! "
419723	419855	419857	419858	the man	2092	" betray you ! What good should I get by that ? You know that a reward of three thousand pounds was offered to any one who would deliver up this Michael Martin ; and as a man of sense , you must also understand that it would not be very convenient for me to go forward and claim this reward . At the same time , I might talk — or my friend might talk ; no one could prevent that ; and such - like idle gossiping would lead to the detection of the old man . Now you are the best judge whether or not it is worth while to put a seal upon our lips . We do n't want to be hard upon you;—but , perhaps , "
419863	419886	419857	419858	the man	2092	" you had better see the old gentleman first , and then you will know that I am telling you the truth . "
419887	419898	419900	419900	Tomlinson	1005	" When can I see him ? where is he ? "
419918	419929	419857	419858	the man	2092	" You had better put off your visit till dusk , "
419934	419964	419857	419858	the man	2092	" because I should like to go with you , and the surgeon would not be very well pleased if I called upon him in the day - time . "
419965	419974	419976	419976	Tomlinson	1005	" Let it be at dusk , then , "
419978	419983	419976	419976	Tomlinson	1005	" Name your hour . "
419984	419998	420000	420003	the stock - broker	4179	" I have an engagement between nine and ten o'clock to - night , "
420005	420011	420013	420014	the visitor	28468	" And so have I , "
420016	420038	420013	420014	the visitor	28468	" What should you say to seven o'clock ? It is as dark then as it is at ten or eleven . "
420039	420046	420048	420048	Tomlinson	1005	" Seven will suit me well , "
420050	420057	420048	420048	Tomlinson	1005	" Where shall I meet you ? "
420058	420081	420083	420086	the body - snatcher	29761	" At Bethnal Green New Church — the church that stands in the Cambridge Road , and faces the Bethnal Green Road , "
420088	420110	420083	420086	the body - snatcher	29761	" You can be walking up and down there a few minutes before seven — I shall not keep you waiting . "
420111	420117	420119	420119	Tomlinson	1005	" I will be punctual , "
420121	420133	420119	420119	Tomlinson	1005	" But — once more — you will not betray me ? "
420134	420137	420083	420086	the body - snatcher	29761	" Ridiculous ! "
420143	420158	420083	420086	the body - snatcher	29761	" And this surgeon — will he not be tempted by the reward to — "
420159	420205	420212	420212	his	29761	" Do you think he would walk straight into Newgate and say , ' I am come to be transported for encouraging and employing resurrection men ? ' You need not alarm yourself . Me and my comrade will settle the matter amicably with you . "
420240	420271	420217	420217	himself	1005	" I have fervently prayed that I might meet my poor old clerk again ; and heaven has granted my request — but merely to punish me for my crimes ! "
420366	420378	420380	420380	Tomlinson	1005	" And thus was it , my good and faithful friend , "
420391	420426	420380	420380	Tomlinson	1005	explanations,—"thus was it that you so nobly sacrificed yourself for me ! Oh ! believe me that I have never ceased to think of your generous — your unparalleled behaviour in that sad business ! "
420427	420436	420438	420440	the old man	2222	" I know it — I know it , "
420448	420478	420480	420480	Michael	1105	" If you had not been a kind master to me , I should never have done all that for you . But , tell me,—and tell me truly , "
420492	420509	420510	420510	Martin	1105	" do you think that these persons — the surgeon , and that hideous man who — "
420545	420553	420555	420555	Tomlinson	1005	" Compose yourself , my excellent friend , "
420567	420673	420555	420555	Tomlinson	1005	" fear alone will seal these people 's lips — even if no other motive were powerful enough to ensure their silence . The surgeon seems an honest kind of man , and may be relied upon : besides , he would seriously compromise himself were he to breathe a word of this strange occurrence . As for the other person — he who came to tell me what had taken place , and brought me hither this evening — I have agreed to purchase his silence and that of a comrade , who , it appears , was engaged with him in the business . "
420674	420687	420689	420690	old Michael	1105	" I know you can not afford to do any such thing , "
420713	420728	420555	420555	Tomlinson	1005	" and I wo n't have you get yourself into difficulties on my account . "
420729	420738	420740	420740	Tomlinson	1005	" Believe me , I can afford it , "
420742	420770	420740	420740	Tomlinson	1005	" You ca n't . You told me just now that you were struggling against many difficulties . How much are you going to give these scoundrels ? "
420771	420781	420555	420555	Tomlinson	1005	" A mere trifle — nothing beyond my means — "
420782	420786	420788	420789	old Michael	1105	" How much ? "
420793	420798	420788	420789	old Michael	1105	" Two hundred pounds . "
420799	420831	420555	420555	Tomlinson	1005	" Two hundred pounds ! It can't — and it sha n't be done , Mr. Tomlinson . You have not got two hundred pounds : I know you have not . "
420832	420849	420851	420851	Tomlinson	1005	" I am to receive five hundred this evening for certain professional services to be rendered , "
420853	420877	420851	420851	Tomlinson	1005	" and I can readily spare a portion to ensure a silence which is necessary not only to your safety but to mine . "
420878	420884	420886	420887	old Michael	1105	" True — your safety , "
420902	420919	420886	420887	old Michael	1105	" Well — well , I suppose it must be done . Do it , then . "
420940	420956	420926	420926	Martin	1105	" You told me that you were going to receive five hundred pounds this evening ? "
420957	420963	420971	420971	his	4179	" Such is my hope , "
420978	420990	420992	420992	Michael	1105	" Ah ! you ca n't look me in the face , "
420997	421008	420992	420992	Michael	1105	" Where are you going to get that money from ? "
421009	421027	421029	421029	Tomlinson	1005	" From a client — for whom I am to do business — of a certain nature , "
421031	421041	421029	421029	Tomlinson	1005	" Certain nature , indeed ! What is it ? "
421042	421048	421085	421085	he	2222	" Merely professional . Michael , "
421053	421067	421069	421071	the old man	2222	" Professional business in one evening , that will produce five hundred pounds , "
421089	421096	421085	421085	he	2222	" I do n't believe it . "
421097	421110	421112	421112	Tomlinson	1005	" I declare most solemnly that I am telling you the truth , "
421123	421133	421135	421137	the old man	2222	" So much the worse for you , then , "
421141	421155	421135	421137	the old man	2222	" The business you are to perform for that sum is not honest . "
421206	421280	421281	421281	he	4502	" Have you not seen enough — experienced enough — and suffered enough , to render you timorous in re - embarking upon the great ocean of chicanery , duplicity , and crime ? Be you well assured that though the currents of that ocean may float you prosperously along for a season , they will sooner or later dash you against a sunken rock , and shipwreck you beyond redemption . Oh ! "
421304	421333	421334	421334	his	4502	eyes,—"Oh ! if you had only passed through all that I have within these last few days , you would not neglect so terrible a warning ! Do you know,"—and
421339	421753	421334	421334	his	4502	eloquent,—"do you know that I have passed the limits of the tomb , and have wandered in the worlds beyond ? Do you know that I have learnt the grand — the sublime — the supernal secret of eternity ? Yes — when the breath left this mortal clay , my soul winged its flight into the regions of infinite space ! With the rapidity of a whirlwind I was hurried away from the earth ; and , although I was nothing but a spirit , and could not touch myself , yet had I ears to hear , and eyes to see , and organs to receive sensations . I was permitted to wander amidst the regions of eternal bliss , and to penetrate into the mysteries of hell . O God ! I tasted of the joys of the former , and was equally compelled to submit to the torments of the latter — each for a little space ! Ah ! sir , can you not divine wherefore the Almighty from time to time plunges mortals into a trance — submits them to the dominion of death for a season ? It is that he may snatch away their souls , to lead them into the celestial mansions , and precipitate them into the depths of Satan 's kingdom,—so that , when restored to their mortal clay , they may teach their fellow - creatures the grand truths of eternity — they may announce to them that there is a heaven to reward , and a hell to punish ! And the Almighty made choice of me,—of me , a grovelling worm , one of the most obscure and humble of his creatures,—He made choice of me , I say , to become the means through which His warning voice might speak to you and others ! What the pleasures of heaven are , or of what the torments of hell consist , I dare not say : suffice it for you to know that there is a heaven , and there is a hell — and the former exceeds all idea which man can conceive of bliss , while the latter surpasses every thing which he can imagine of horror ! Be warned , then , by me , James Tomlinson — be warned by one who for four days was snatched away from earth , and , during that period was initiated in the mighty secrets of Eternity ! "
421939	421947	421948	421948	he	1005	" How gets on my patient now ? "
421955	421974	421984	421984	he	4179	" I fear — I am afraid — that is , I think — his head , wanders , "
421987	422004	422006	422007	the surgeon	29781	" We must expect that such will be the case — for some days to come , "
422035	422041	422043	422043	Tomlinson	1005	" You think , then , "
422045	422067	422043	422043	Tomlinson	1005	" that it is possible for this poor old man to rave — about things of — a very extraordinary nature ? "
422068	422084	422086	422087	the surgeon	29781	" People , when delirious , burst forth into the most wild and fanciful ravings , "
422096	422115	422086	422087	the surgeon	29781	" And he might , then , rave of heaven — and hell — and things relating to — "
422116	422124	422126	422127	the surgeon	29781	" He may rave of any nonsense , "
422131	422155	422126	422127	the surgeon	29781	" but that is no reason why we should allow ourselves to be affected by it — as I see that you are . "
422156	422168	422170	422170	Tomlinson	1005	" It was , indeed , very foolish on my part , "
422201	422210	422212	422213	the surgeon	29781	" You had better retire for the present , "
422215	422259	422212	422213	the surgeon	29781	" He is in a high fever — produced , perhaps , by this interview with you , under such circumstances . Do not think of seeing him again this evening : to - morrow evening he will be better and more composed . "
422260	422271	422273	422276	the stock - broker	4179	" And you will take every possible care of him , "
422278	422304	422273	422276	the stock - broker	4179	" Remember that no expense most be spared to make him comfortable — to ensure his recovery . I will remunerate you handsomely , sir . "
422305	422310	422312	422313	the surgeon	29781	" Well , well , "
422317	422340	422312	422313	the surgeon	29781	" We will talk about that another time . Good evening — you may return to - morrow at the same hour . "
422341	422345	422347	422347	Tomlinson	1005	" Good evening , "
422562	422595	422544	422545	Mr. Chichester	886	" When the other person comes , show him into the back parlour , as I may require to have some conversation with this gentleman before I introduce them to each other . "
422614	422621	422623	422623	Chichester	886	" You are before your time , "
422637	422643	422623	422623	Chichester	886	" that looks like business . "
422644	422657	422632	422635	the stock - broker	4179	" I accidentally had an appointment upon some business in this neighbourhood , "
422662	422676	422632	422635	the stock - broker	4179	" and when that matter was disposed of , I came straight hither . "
422677	422693	422695	422695	Chichester	886	" We can not repair to the lunatic asylum until ten or half - past , "
422697	422734	422695	422695	Chichester	886	" because , as a precaution , the keeper has promised to call upon me presently , and report whether my wife continues in the same docile mood as when he wrote to me yesterday afternoon . "
422735	422757	422759	422759	Tomlinson	1005	" I should be delighted to hear that you could settle this unpleasant — very unpleasant affair in some amicable way , "
422781	422788	422790	422790	Chichester	886	" Impossible , my dear sir ! "
422792	422821	422790	422790	Chichester	886	" There is no way save the one chalked out . I hope that you do not hesitate to fulfil the agreement into which you entered with me . "
422822	422830	422832	422832	Tomlinson	1005	" The truth is , Mr. Chichester , "
422834	422910	422832	422832	Tomlinson	1005	" there is no man in London to whom a few hundreds of pounds would prove so welcome as to me — especially as to - morrow I have to pay two hundred to men who will not be very well pleased to experience a disappointment . It is true that I possess such a sum at my bankers ' ; but I dare not draw out every shilling — my credit would be ruined . "
422911	422925	422927	422927	Chichester	886	" So much the better reason for doing as I require of you , "
422935	422938	422940	422940	Tomlinson	1005	" True , "
422942	422970	422940	422940	Tomlinson	1005	" But , on the other hand , I tremble to take a false step — I fear to jeopardize myself by connivance at a direct conspiracy — "
422971	422974	422976	422976	Chichester	886	" Pshaw ! "
422978	423002	422976	422976	Chichester	886	" What is the use of compunction on the part of a man who stands in so much need of money as yourself ? "
423022	423032	423034	423034	Chichester	886	" It is no one — of any consequence , "
423051	423078	423046	423046	he	886	" There is no use in introducing these men to each other , unless this milk - and - water fool is quite agreeable to act . "
423079	423086	423088	423091	the stock - broker	4179	" Did you make an observation ? "
423093	423138	423046	423046	he	886	" I was observing that it was no one of any consequence;—only some person for the servants , most probably . But let me now ask you seriously , Mr. Tomlinson , whether you feel disposed to proceed further in this matter or not ? "
423139	423148	423046	423046	he	886	" Candidly speaking , I would rather not , "
423153	423190	423046	423046	he	886	" Then you were wrong to give me a false hope of your aid , and allow so much valuable time to elapse , during which I might have found a broker less punctilious than you . "
423191	423202	423204	423204	Tomlinson	1005	" I regret that I should have caused this inconvenience , "
423206	423233	423204	423204	Tomlinson	1005	" but I had resolved to perform my promise until about an hour ago , and I have even brought the necessary documents for the purpose . "
423234	423246	423248	423248	Chichester	886	" Something very remarkable must have intervened to change your resolutions , "
423252	423258	423260	423260	Tomlinson	1005	" I am not superstitions , "
423262	423275	423260	423260	Tomlinson	1005	" but I believe that a providential warning was conveyed to me — "
423276	423306	423204	423204	Tomlinson	1005	" A providential fiddle - stick ! Remember , Mr. Tomlinson , that by your unpardonable vacillation in this matter you will only prolong the incarceration of my wife . "
423307	423319	423353	423353	his	886	" And , pray , who is responsible for that deed ? "
423320	423328	423330	423330	Chichester	886	" We will not discuss this point , "
423332	423348	423349	423349	he	886	" I did not ask you to become my Mentor . At the same time , "
423356	423371	423353	423353	his	886	" every moment is important — for my wife is going mad in reality ! "
423372	423386	423388	423388	Tomlinson	1005	" Then , in the name of God , release her at once ! "
423390	423399	423353	423353	his	886	" Never — until she signs the deed . "
423400	423404	423406	423406	Tomlinson	1005	" Release her , "
423408	423426	423406	423406	Tomlinson	1005	" and then bring her with you to my office , where she can make the transfer . "
423427	423555	423353	423353	his	886	" Are you mad yourself ? Do you suppose she would ever put pen to paper if she were once liberated in that manner ? I am surprised at your ignorance — vexed at your cowardice . You have not acted like a man of business , nor as a man of the world . It was for you to accept or decline my proposal — not to deceive me by these changes and shiftings of inclination . Come , sir — once for all — pluck up your courage : remember the two hundred pounds which you say must be paid to - morrow to two men who will not be put off , and the settlement of which debt will so materially embarrass your finances . "
423556	423566	423568	423568	Tomlinson	1005	" My mind is made up , Mr. Chichester , "
423571	423578	423568	423568	Tomlinson	1005	" And what is your decision ? "
423579	423589	423353	423353	his	886	" I shall beg to withdraw from the transaction . "
423626	423637	423639	423640	the individual	8955	" You shall not forfeit your word in this respect , "
423660	423668	423670	423670	Tomlinson	1005	" What does this man do here ? "
423680	423694	423696	423697	the man	2092	" What do I do here ? what do I do every where ? "
423704	423774	423696	423697	the man	2092	" Tell me the secret plot — the cunning intrigue—- the scheme of villany to which Anthony Tidkins , surnamed the Resurrection Man , is a stranger ! But little did I think when I called upon you this morning,—little did I imagine when I met you again this evening , that you were the person enlisted by Mr. Chichester in the affair which we have now in hand . "
423775	423790	423792	423792	Chichester	886	" It would appear , then , that you are acquainted with each other , "
423813	423826	423696	423697	the man	2092	" Why , what devilry was it that brought you two together ? "
423827	423868	423870	423872	the Resurrection Man;—and	12034	" Whether I keep Mr. Tomlinson 's secret , or whether I proclaim it to you and every one else whom I know , until the whole town rings with the circumstance , is a matter for him to decide , "
423887	423900	423902	423902	Tomlinson	1005	" If I pay you two hundred pounds , as agreed upon , "
423904	423913	423902	423902	Tomlinson	1005	" what more would you require of me ? "
423914	423943	423696	423697	the man	2092	" I require that you remain faithful to your promise to Mr. Chichester;—I require that you fulfil the service which you have undertaken to perform in his behalf , "
423949	423968	423696	423697	the man	2092	" And in what way does the business regard you — you , who acknowledge yourself to be — "
423969	423988	423990	423990	Tidkins	998	" A resurrectionist ! Certainly I am — and the most skilful in London , no other excepted , "
423997	424020	423990	423990	Tidkins	998	" But that does not prevent me from turning mad - house keeper — or any thing else — when opportunity offers . "
424021	424040	424042	424045	the stock - broker	4179	" What ! you are the keeper of the asylum in which this gentleman 's wife is imprisoned ! "
424056	424063	424065	424065	Chichester	886	" Yes , he is indeed , "
424067	424087	424065	424065	Chichester	886	" and a better keeper could not have been found . So now you know all about that point . "
424088	424103	424105	424107	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And Mr. Tomlinson will be good enough to accompany me to my house , "
424109	424133	424105	424107	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You , Mr. Chichester , can follow us at a little distance . It looks suspicious for three people to walk together . "
424134	424140	424142	424142	Tomlinson	1005	" I really must decline — "
424164	424172	424174	424176	the Resurrection Man	3220	" One word more , Mr. Tomlinson , "
424178	424266	424174	424176	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I am a person of determined spirit and resolution . I never stick at trifles myself ; and I do n't choose others , with whom I am connected , to balk me in my designs , when I can prevent them . Now , either come with me , and do what is required of you ; or , as sure as there is breath in your body , I will deliver up a certain person to the police , and stand the consequences myself . "
424267	424277	424354	424354	he	3220	" I beg of you — I implore you — "
424278	424281	424283	424283	Chichester	886	" Pshaw ! "
424285	424292	424283	424283	Chichester	886	" this is child 's play ! "
424293	424300	424302	424304	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Child 's play , indeed ! "
424310	424335	424302	424304	the Resurrection Man	3220	" But I will put an end to it . Come , sir — hesitate another minute , and that old man is lost ! "
424336	424342	424354	424354	he	3220	" I will accompany you , "
424357	424364	424354	424354	he	3220	" But God knows how unwillingly ! "
424464	424470	424441	424441	Tomlinson	1005	" Do not be afraid , "
424475	424530	424531	424531	Chichester	886	" I am as close as Newgate - door when people conduct themselves as they ought to do . One individual for whom I do business never knows what I am engaged in for another — unless his own bad behaviour forces me to blab . So make yourself quite easy upon that score . "
424622	424625	424611	424611	he	1005	" Holloa ! "
424644	424650	424611	424611	he	1005	" I suppose that this — "
424651	424654	424656	424658	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Hush ! "
424941	424971	424973	424975	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You see , this house was built for a lunatic asylum many — many years ago , when treatment was n't quite so humane as it is now , "
424979	424998	424973	424975	the Resurrection Man	3220	" but it had n't been used as such for the last thirty years till the other day . "
424999	425017	425019	425019	Tomlinson	1005	" And did you hire the establishment for the purpose of restoring it to its original uses ? "
425041	425047	425049	425049	Tidkins	998	" Not I , indeed , "
425062	425068	425070	425072	the Resurrection Man	3220	" This is the cell , "
425387	425390	425391	425391	she	28625	" Villains ! "
425394	425400	425391	425391	she	28625	" would you murder me ? "
425401	425409	425411	425411	Chichester	886	" No such thing , my dear , "
425413	425431	425391	425391	she	28625	" We have merely come to terminate this unpleasant business in the way proposed by Mr. Tidkins . "
425432	425436	425438	425438	Viola	1319	" The wretch ! "
425455	425470	425472	425472	Tidkins	998	" Ah ! I dare say I am , ma'am , in your estimation , "
425476	425520	425472	425472	Tidkins	998	" Oh ! you need n't look at me in that way , ma'am . I will acknowledge that I am your keeper in this establishment ; and that it 's me who has been good enough to bring you food every night . "
425521	425525	425528	425530	the unhappy lady	4203	" The wretch ! "
425553	425560	425561	425561	she	4203	" It is you , then , "
425574	425626	425561	425561	she	4203	" it is you who have dared to practise upon my fears in a manner the most diabolical — the most cowardly;—you who have chosen the solemn hour of midnight for your visits , and who have come in a guise calculated to fill my mind with the most horrible imaginings ! "
425627	425634	425636	425636	Tidkins	998	" Remember our agreement , ma'am , "
425640	425677	425636	425636	Tidkins	998	" You pledged yourself to forget the past upon certain conditions : we are here to fulfil those conditions . Do you mean to keep your word ? or must we leave you to your solitude ? "
425678	425684	425686	425686	Viola	1319	" Who is this gentleman ? "
425695	425704	425706	425706	Chichester	1319	" The stock - broker , my dear , "
425708	425722	425706	425706	Chichester	1319	" the person who will receive your signature to a certain little paper — "
425723	425728	425730	425731	the lady	2373	" Then , sir , "
425739	425913	425734	425734	herself	2373	" as you exercise an honourable profession , prove yourself an honourable man in this respect . You see before you a powerless female , who was weak enough to bestow her hand upon a villain — a villain that has immured her , by the aid of another villain of even a deeper dye than himself , in this horrible vault ! Perhaps they have told you that I am mad , sir ; but do I speak like one whose reason has abandoned her ? or would you receive the signature of a person who knew not what she signed ? Oh ! no , sir — you can not believe that I am in mental darkness ! you must perceive the full extent of the villany that has been practised against me , for the purpose of plundering me of that property which I received from my former husband ! Oh ! if you be a man possessing one spark of honour — as I must suppose that you are — "
425914	425923	425925	425926	Mr. Chichester	886	" Come — a truce to all this , "
425928	425950	425925	425926	Mr. Chichester	886	" The gentleman to whom you are addressing yourself knows the whole affair , and will act with and for me . "
425951	425958	425960	425962	the unhappy lady	4203	" Is this true , sir ? "
425984	426006	426007	426007	she	4203	" can this be true ? Is it possible that a person exercising an honourable profession can league with wretches of their stamp?"—and
426017	426038	426007	426007	she	4203	" Oh ! no , it can not be ! At least , hear me ! I married that man — "
426039	426051	426053	426053	Chichester	886	" Do n't I tell you that Mr. Tomlinson knows all , "
426057	426075	426053	426053	Chichester	886	" We did not come to debate upon the past , but to settle for the future . "
426076	426093	426095	426095	Viola	1319	" You have come , then , to plunder a weak , helpless , persecuted female , "
426097	426174	426175	426175	she	12093	" But do you know , sir , the terrible means that have been adopted to wring from me a consent to part with half the property which was bequeathed to me by a man that loved me — a man who toiled for years and years to amass the fortune that must now be devoted to the extravagances of a spendthrift ? Would you believe to what an extent the cruelty , the cowardice of that man,"—and
426178	426326	426053	426053	Chichester	886	Tidkins,—"has been carried to terrify me into compliance with the demands of his employer ? Sir , for three weeks and three days have I been a prisoner in this dungeon ; and every night — without fail — has that miscreant visited me in a disguise which , in such a place , and at such an hour , would make the stoutest heart palpitate with horror,—a disguise of such a nature that this is the first time that I have seen his face ; for on the fatal evening when I was seized and brought to this dungeon , every thing was involved in utter obscurity;—and then , when the door opened again , and a light gleamed in upon me,—O God ! it was carried by a person dressed in a dark cloak and a white mask — like a being of another world ! "
426327	426339	426341	426341	Tomlinson	1005	" Surely you did not go to such extremes as this ? "
426351	426367	426369	426369	Tidkins	998	" Whatever I did , or did not , is nothing to the present business , "
426373	426410	426411	426411	Tomlinson	1005	" If any thing is going to be done , let it be done at once ; if not , the lady will remain here till she chooses to consent to the terms proposed to her . "
426497	426506	426508	426508	Chichester	1319	" Now , what is to be done ? "
426510	426519	426521	426522	the lady	2373	" It is for this gentleman to decide , "
426531	426626	426521	426522	the lady	2373	" You may well suppose that I am desirous to recover the liberty which has thus been infamously violated;—but if you , sir , possess one germ of generous feeling — one spark of honour — one gleam of humanity in your soul , do not — do not lend yourself to this infamy ! Command these men to restore me to freedom — they can not refuse to obey you ! Oh ! sir — hear me — do not avert your head : hear me — hear me , I implore you ! "
426627	426638	426640	426642	the Resurrection Man	3220	" This is quite enough of folly for one time , "
426644	426685	426698	426698	he	3220	" I have been an idiot myself to listen to it so long . Mr. Tomlinson , are you prepared to receive the signature of this lady to the deed that will transfer to her husband a certain portion of her property?"—then
426705	426718	426698	426698	he	3220	" Hesitate — and I denounce your late clerk within an hour ! "
426775	426786	426753	426753	he	3220	" I am ready to receive that lady 's signature . "
426833	426844	426845	426845	he	1005	" In whose favour is the transfer to be made ? "
426848	426862	426864	426864	Viola	1319	" Then , sir , you are determined to league with my oppressors ? "
426878	426886	426864	426864	Viola	1319	" Madam , I am unfortunately compelled — "
426887	426894	426896	426897	the lady	2373	" Say no more , sir , "
426907	426934	426896	426897	the lady	2373	" If you came hither a villain , I must be mad indeed to hope to make you an honest man by any reasoning of mine . "
426935	426945	426947	426947	Tomlinson	1005	" Madam , you wrong me , by heavens ! "
426980	426994	426995	426995	Tomlinson	1005	" Hesitate another moment , and I denounce you and your cashier together ! "
427009	427020	426995	426995	Tomlinson	1005	" In whose favour is this transfer to be made ? "
427021	427029	427031	427031	Viola	1319	" In that of Mr. Arthur Chichester , "
427035	427045	427031	427031	Viola	1319	" What is the amount to be so transferred ? "
427046	427074	427076	427078	the injured woman	12102	" Eight thousand pounds , being part of a sum now standing in my name in the Three - and - a - Half per cents . , "
427130	427148	427127	427127	he	1005	" You are aware , madam , that this document is ante - dated by two months ? "
427149	427155	427127	427127	he	1005	" I am , sir . "
427156	427172	427173	427173	Viola	1319	" Nothing now remains , then , madam , save for you to sign it . "
427217	427234	427206	427206	she	1319	" What guarantee have I that my freedom is to follow this concession on my part ? "
427235	427250	427252	427252	Chichester	1319	" To - morrow evening , at dusk , you shall be conveyed home , "
427261	427277	427252	427252	Chichester	1319	" And why not this evening — now — the moment that document is signed ? "
427278	427291	427206	427206	she	1319	" Because I should prefer laying my hand on the money first , "
427296	427300	427302	427303	the lady	2373	" Mr. Tomlinson , "
427305	427344	427302	427303	the lady	2373	" I have more confidence in you than in either of these men : I am willing even to believe that some circumstance , unknown to me , compels you unwillingly to become their instrument on this occasion . "
427345	427356	427358	427358	Tomlinson	1005	" By heavens , you speak the truth , madam ! "
427362	427403	427358	427358	Tomlinson	1005	" I believe you . Now , sir , promise me on your most solemn word of honour — by every thing you consider sacred—- that to - morrow evening at nine o'clock I shall be released from this dungeon . "
427404	427424	427426	427426	Tomlinson	1005	" I promise — I swear that you shall be conveyed home to - morrow evening at nine o'clock , "
427428	427455	427426	427426	Tomlinson	1005	" But , in return , madam , will you pledge yourself as solemnly that your lips shall ever remain closed with regard to this proceeding ? "
427456	427467	427469	427471	the poor creature	2916	" Oh ! yes — I do — I do , "
427507	427522	427524	427524	Chichester	1319	" Secresy on all sides is one of the conditions of the present arrangement , "
427526	427535	427537	427539	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And if the lady breaks that condition , "
427541	427593	427537	427539	the Resurrection Man	3220	" she would repent it ; for let her be surrounded by friends — let her be protected by a regiment of soldiers — let her take refuge in the Queen 's palace , I would still find means to tear her away , and bring her back to this dungeon . "
427650	427658	427659	427659	she	1319	" I am now at your mercy , "
427674	427689	427691	427691	Chichester	1319	" You need not be afraid that we shall deceive you , my dear , "
427741	427752	427754	427756	the Resurrection Man	3220	" No — there 's nothing to be afraid of , "
427758	427836	427754	427756	the Resurrection Man	3220	" The lady has fulfilled her part of the bargain , and we will perform ours . As for her keeping this little business dark , I feel confident about that : she would not like to stand the chance of coming here again ; and , as for making a disturbance merely to get back the money , that would be useless , when once it had found its way into the pockets of her husband . "
427899	427911	427912	427912	he	3220	" You see that I expected how all this would end , "
427920	427964	427912	427912	he	3220	" and so I prepared a little treat for the lady . Here 's a prime fowl ; that brown paper contains ham ; here 's a new loaf ; and this is a bottle of as excellent sherry as one need drink . "
428015	428025	428027	428027	Tidkins	998	" We must now take leave of Mrs. Chichester , "
428029	428046	428027	428027	Tidkins	998	" To - morrow evening , ma'am , at nine precisely , you shall be free . "
428083	428089	428066	428066	she	1319	" Remember your solemn promise ! "
428090	428112	428113	428113	Viola	1319	" Do not be alarmed , madam . There can be no interest to detain you here beyond to - morrow . "
428162	428172	428159	428159	she	1319	" God grant that they may not deceive me ! "
428220	428233	428234	428234	she	1319	" Oh ! fool that I was , to sign that paper ! "
428243	428315	428234	428234	she	1319	" Will men , who are capable of such villany — such atrocity as this that they have practised towards me,—will they remain satisfied with a portion of the gold that has allured them to violate every principle of honour and humanity ? Oh ! no — no ! and perhaps — to conceal their crime the more effectually — they will not hesitate to imbrue their hands in my blood ! "
428360	428426	428427	428427	She	1319	" Still — still there was something honest in the appearance of that stock - broker : there was something feeling in his words ! He was performing a task against which his soul revolted . He commiserated my condition : oh ! yes — he sympathised with me ! In him is my hope — my only hope ! I need not quite despair ! "
429117	429134	429135	429135	he	874	" Isabella — dearest Isabella ! What good angel prompted you to grant me this interview ? "
429147	429156	429158	429159	the signora	5333	" Do you think me indiscreet , Richard ? "
429172	429179	429181	429182	her lover	2356	" Indiscreet , my sweet girl ! "
429184	429219	429181	429182	her lover	2356	" Oh ! how can you suppose that I would entertain a harsh feeling with regard to that goodness on your part which doubtless instigated you to afford me the happiness of this meeting ? "
429220	429235	429237	429237	Isabella	1066	" But when we met here — seven or eight months ago , Richard , "
429239	429262	429237	429237	Isabella	1066	" I told you that never — never would I consent to a stolen interview . And now — you may imagine — "
429263	429280	429282	429282	Markham	874	" I imagine that you love me , Isabella — love me as I love you , "
429284	429393	429282	429282	Markham	874	" and what other idea can occupy my thoughts when that one is present ? Oh ! you know not the ineffable joy — the unequalled pleasure which I experienced when your letter reached me yesterday . I recognised your handwriting immediately ; and I seized the letter with avidity , when it was brought to me in my study . And then , Isabella — will you believe me when I tell you that I trembled to open it ? I laid it upon the table — my hand refused to break the seal . Pardon me — forgive me , if for a moment I feared — "
429394	429406	429408	429408	Isabella	1066	" That I had forgotten my vows — my plighted affection , "
429412	429435	429408	429408	Isabella	1066	" Again I say pardon — forgive me , dearest girl ; but — oh ! I have been so very unfortunate ! "
429436	429445	429447	429447	Isabella	1066	" Think not of the past , Richard , "
429451	429480	429482	429482	Markham	874	" The past ! Oh ! how can I cease to ponder upon the past , when it has nearly bereaved me of all hope for the future ? "
429489	429494	429496	429496	Isabella	1066	" Not all hope , "
429498	429506	429496	429496	Isabella	1066	" since hope still remains to me ! "
429507	429513	429515	429515	Richard	874	" Angel that thou art ! "
429524	429542	429496	429496	Isabella	1066	" How weak I am , since it is from thee that moral courage ever is imparted . "
429543	429551	429553	429553	Isabella	1066	" You were speaking of my letter , "
429559	429675	429553	429553	Isabella	1066	" True ! But so many emotions — joy and hope — sorrowful reminiscences and brighter prospects , bewilder me ! I will , however , try to talk calmly ! When your letter came , I feared to open it for some moments : I dreaded a new calamity ! But at length I called all my firmness to my aid ; and a terrible weight was taken from my soul , when my eye glanced at the first lines of that letter which suddenly became as dear and welcome as a reprieve to the condemned criminal . Then , when I saw that my beloved Isabella still thought of me — still loved me—- "
429676	429689	429691	429691	Isabella	1066	" Oh , I did not tell you that in my letter , "
429700	429770	429691	429691	Isabella	1066	" No — but I divined it — I gathered it from the words in which you conveyed to me your desire to see me — from the manner in which you said that at eleven o'clock this morning you should walk in the very place where we had met accidentally once before — oh ! I suddenly became a new being : never was my heart so light ! "
429771	429795	429553	429553	Isabella	1066	" And yet I said in my letter , Richard , that I wished to see you upon a matter of business — — "
429796	429850	429553	429553	Isabella	1066	" Ah ! Isabella , destroy not the charm which makes me happy ! Let no cold thought of worldly things chill the heavenly fervour of our affection . Were it not for that love which reciprocally exists between us , how should I have supported the misfortunes that have multiplied upon me ? "
429851	429882	429553	429553	Isabella	1066	" Again I say , Richard , allude not to the past . Alas ! bitter — bitter were the tears that I wept on that fatal night when — — "
429883	429916	429553	429553	Isabella	1066	" When I was publicly disgraced at the theatre — in the midst of a triumph . Yes — Isabella , you were there — there , when my shame was consummated ! "
429917	429928	429930	429930	Isabella	1066	" Accident had led us to the theatre that evening , "
429932	430037	429930	429930	Isabella	1066	" My father had heard that a new tragedy , of which grand hopes were entertained , was to be produced ; and he insisted that I should accompany him and my mother . I was compelled to assent to his desire — although I prefer retirement and tranquillity to society and gaiety . You may conceive our astonishment — you may imagine my surprise and my joy , when you came forward to acknowledge the congratulations offered for a triumph so brilliantly achieved . And then — but let us leave that subject — my blood turns cold when I think of it ! "
430038	430052	430054	430054	Markham	874	" Oh ! go on — speak of it , speak of it ! "
430058	430097	430054	430054	Markham	874	" for although the reminiscence of that fearful scene be like pouring molten lead upon an open wound , still it is sweet — it is sweet , Isabella , to receive sympathy from such lips as yours . "
430098	430137	430139	430139	Isabella	1066	" Alas ! I have little more to say — except that the sudden intervention of that terrible man seemed to strike me as with the arrow of death ; and I became insensible . Then , Richard,—then , "
430148	430169	430139	430139	Isabella	1066	" my mother suspected my secret — or rather received a confirmation of the suspicion which she had long entertained ! "
430170	430179	430181	430181	Markham	874	" And she shuddered at the mere idea ? "
430185	430235	430181	430181	Markham	874	" No , Richard : my mother is kind and good — and , you know , was always well disposed towards you : I have told you that much before ! She said little — and of that no matter ! But my father — my father — — "
430236	430243	430245	430245	Richard	874	" He discovered our secret also ! "
430247	430256	430245	430245	Richard	874	" Oh ! did he not curse me ? "
430257	430291	430139	430139	Isabella	1066	" He was cool and calm , when — on the following morning — he spoke to me upon the subject . I answered him frankly : I admitted my attachment for you . "
430292	430310	430181	430181	Markham	874	" What did he say , Isabella ! Tell me every thing — suppress not a word ! "
430311	430322	430324	430324	Isabella	1066	" Oh , heavens ! he made me very miserable , "
430332	430385	430139	430139	Isabella	1066	" But wherefore distress both yourself and me with a recapitulation of what ensued ? Suffice it to say , that I collected all the arguments in my memory — and they were not a few;—and I presented to him that paper — the confession of Talbot , which proved your innocence ! "
430386	430390	430392	430392	Markham	874	" Dearest girl ! "
430396	430405	430407	430407	Isabella	1066	" He did not refuse to read it , "
430409	430448	430454	430454	Markham	874	" and at length , when I saw that I had made a profound impression on him , I turned the conversation upon the momentary reverse of fortune which had plunged him into a debtors ' prison — — "
430449	430452	430454	430454	Markham	874	" Isabella ! "
430459	430521	430454	430454	Markham	874	" And then I boldly declared my conviction that the unknown friend who had released him — the anonymous individual who had thrown open to him the gate leading to liberty — the nameless person , that had done so generous a deed , and accomplished it in a manner as delicate as it was noble,—was none other than Richard Markham ! "
430573	430584	430586	430586	Markham	874	" Oh , Isabella ! you told your father that ! "
430588	430597	430586	430586	Markham	874	" And yet — you knew not — — "
430598	430607	430609	430609	Isabella	1066	" My suspicion amounted almost to a certainty , "
430611	430690	430609	430609	Isabella	1066	" and now I doubt no longer . Oh ! Richard — if ever for one moment I had wavered in my love for you,—if ever an instant of coldness , arising from worldly reflections , had intervened to make me repent my solemn vows to you,—that one deed of yours — that noble sacrifice of your property , made to release my revered parent from a gaol,—that — that alone would have rendered my heart unalterably thine ! "
430691	430704	430706	430706	Markham	874	" Beloved girl — this moment is the happiest of my life ! "
430727	430732	430734	430734	Isabella	1066	" Yes , Richard , "
430777	430820	430767	430775	a lady whose brow was encircled with a diadem	12157	" yes , Richard , if ever I felt that no deed nor act of mine shall separate us eternally — if ever I rejoiced in the prospect of possessing wealth , and receiving lustre from my father 's princely rank — — "
430821	430824	430826	430826	Richard	874	" Isabella ! "
430848	430855	430767	430775	a lady whose brow was encircled with a diadem	12157	" Isabella , what mean you ? "
430856	430860	430862	430863	the signora	5333	" I mean , "
430877	430948	430862	430863	the signora	5333	" I mean that henceforth , Richard , I can have no secret from you,—that I must now disclose what has often before trembled upon my tongue ; a secret which my father would not , however , as yet , have revealed to the English public generally,—the secret of his rank ; for he whom the world knows as the Count Alteroni , is Alberto , Prince of Castelcicala ! "
431015	431031	431008	431008	Isabella	1066	" Richard — dear Richard — do you not believe how much I love you ? "
431061	431066	431067	431067	he	874	" Ah ! Isabella , "
431072	431083	431067	431067	he	874	" how insuperable is the barrier which divides us now ! "
431084	431115	431117	431117	Isabella	1066	" And — if that barrier to which you allude , ever existed , was it less formidable when you were ignorant of the secret than it is at present ? "
431121	431128	431130	431130	Richard	874	" It seems so to me , "
431132	431218	431130	431130	Richard	874	" Are you not placed on an eminence to which I never can hope to reach ? have I not dared to lift my ambitious eyes towards a Princess — the daughter of one who will some day wear a sovereign crown ? Oh ! now the delusion is gone — I am awakened from a long dream ! But , say — did your highness make this revelation to - day , in order to extinguish my adventurous aspirations at once and for ever ? "
431219	431230	431232	431232	Isabella	1066	" Richard , you wrong me — cruelly wrong me ! "
431238	431250	431252	431252	Markham	874	" Forgive me — forgive me , sweetest , dearest girl ! "
431254	431270	431252	431252	Markham	874	" I was mad — I raved — I knew not what I said — — "
431271	431318	431130	431130	Richard	874	" Richard , when we met here — once before — you doubted my affection , and then you asked me to forgive you ! How often will you put my feelings to so cruel a test ? how often will you renew those unjust suspicions ? "
431319	431358	431252	431252	Markham	874	" O God ! what have I done , that I should thus call tears to your eyes , Isabella ? Forgive me , again — I say — forgive me : on my knees I implore — — "
431359	431373	431375	431375	Isabella	1066	" No — no ! I think no more of what you said , "
431377	431382	431383	431383	she	1066	" Calm yourself for my sake!"—and
431408	431413	431414	431414	he	12162	" Yes , Isabella , "
431417	431431	431414	431414	he	12162	" I am now calm ; and you — you are an angel ! "
431432	431444	431446	431447	the Princess	12163	" A mere terrestrial one , Richard , I am afraid , "
431453	431540	431446	431447	the Princess	12163	" And now let me speak to you upon the little matter of business to which I alluded in my note . After I had informed my father that you were the generous unknown who had been the means of his release from prison , he exclaimed , ' Excellent - hearted young man ! How I have wronged him by my injurious suspicions concerning that night when the burglary was attempted at our home ! ' You see that I tell you his very words . "
431541	431563	431414	431414	he	12162	" Yes — tell me every thing , dear Isabella . And , thus , your father no longer believes — — "
431564	431590	431592	431592	Isabella	1066	" How can he believe that any one would attempt to rob him one day , and pay nearly two thousand pounds for him another ? "
431594	431614	431592	431592	Isabella	1066	" Oh , no — he is disabused upon that point . Would that he were unprejudiced on others ! "
431615	431620	431622	431622	Markham	874	" I understand you , "
431626	431657	431622	431622	Markham	874	" The Prince can not consent to renew his acquaintance with one who has been subjected to an infamous punishment , and who aspires to the hand of his daughter . "
431658	431668	431670	431670	Isabella	1066	" Alas ! you have divined but too truly , "
431677	431737	431670	431670	Isabella	1066	" Nevertheless , may we not hope ? Already is one great point gained : my father believes that you may have been unfortunate , and not guilty . Oh ! that is a great obstacle removed ! And in my mother , Richard , you have a warm friend — although her prejudices of rank and family — — "
431738	431749	431751	431751	Markham	874	" I can well comprehend the sentiments of her Highness , "
431753	431767	431751	431751	Markham	874	" and it is all that which now makes me fear lest — — "
431768	431777	431779	431779	Isabella	1066	" Fear not — but hope every thing , "
431843	431855	431857	431857	Richard	874	" Yes — I will hope , for both our sakes , "
431859	431869	431871	431871	Isabella	1066	" And now let me conclude my little narrative , "
431873	431979	431981	431981	Isabella	1066	" My father resolved to repay you the money you had so generously advanced , the moment he was enabled ; and as the Grand Duke of Castelcicala has settled upon him an income of ten thousand a - year , besides an immediate grant of forty thousand pounds,—boons which my father had only accepted because no political condition was attached to them , and because they are alleged to be an indemnification for his estates which have been confiscated,—he only awaited the arrival of his first remittances to acquit himself of that debt of honour . The day before yesterday he gave this letter , "
431992	432053	431981	431981	Isabella	1066	" to one of our servants to convey to the post at Richmond . I demanded it back again privately of the servant , with the view of placing it myself in your hands , and — and taking the opportunity to reveal to you a secret which I did not think it right to keep from you any longer . "
432054	432068	432070	432070	Markham	874	" I receive this packet , then , Isabella , with its contents , "
432080	432127	432070	432070	Markham	874	" because your father is happily in a position to repay me the trifle which I was enabled to disburse for his benefit . But ten thousand times more valuable is this sum to me , since its payment prompted you to grant me this interview . "
432128	432139	432141	432142	the lady	2373	" I had so much to tell you , Richard , "
432149	432172	432141	432142	the lady	2373	" that I could not commit it all to paper . I therefore adopted this plan — which perhaps is indiscreet — — "
432173	432183	432185	432185	Markham	874	" Use not that epithet again , dear Isabella , "
432187	432247	432185	432185	Markham	874	" You assure me that you love me : can you then regret that you have made me happy by allowing me to see you — to talk to you — to embrace you once again ? And yet , in the midst of that happiness , the sad thought intrudes upon me—'When shall I see thee again ? ' "
432248	432263	432265	432265	Isabella	1066	" Accident may throw us together soon — as it has done ere now , "
432267	432282	432265	432265	Isabella	1066	" accident — or rather Providence — does so much for us poor mortals . "
432283	432335	432185	432185	Markham	874	" But , with your mother 's prejudices in favour of rank and birth , and with your father 's high destinies , what hope can exist for so humble an individual as myself ? How can I dare aspire to the hand of a Princess of a powerful independent state ? "
432336	432356	432185	432185	Markham	874	" Did not Miss Eliza Sydney espouse the Grand Duke of Castelcicala ? and she — she also — — "
432357	432363	432365	432365	Markham	874	" Oh ! I remember , "
432370	432406	432185	432185	Markham	874	hesitated,—"I remember that she also was unfortunate , as I was ; and she also endured a weary imprisonment of two years . Yes — I accept the omen — it is an auspicious one ! "
432435	432567	432432	432432	he	874	" Oh ! if ever this fond aspiration should be realised,—if ever the humble and obscure Englishman were united to the high - born and brilliant Italian Princess , how sweet — how sweet would it be for him to owe rank and fortune to the woman whom he loved so fondly , and whom he would ever love until the hand of Death should beckon him to the tomb ! For myself , I pant not for the honours and glories of this life ; for hadst thou , Isabella , been the daughter of the lowest peasants , I had loved thee all the same — and had been far , far more contented , because the obstacles which now oppose our happiness might then have ceased to exist ! "
432568	432574	432576	432576	Isabella	1066	" Believe me , Richard , "
432585	432812	432432	432432	he	874	" believe me , that the happiest day of my life will be that when I can prove to you the extent of that affection with which you have inspired me;—and , again I repeat , that if ever I rejoiced in the prospect of that fortune which , whether my father eventually succeed to the ducal throne or not , he will be enabled to leave me,—and if ever I felt proud of that high station which my family enjoys , or indulged in the hope that my parents may one day attain to sovereign rank,—that joy , that pride , that hope are all experienced on account of you ! For , like you , I care not for the grandeur and ostentation of palaces;—but it will be a thrice happy day for me , when I can say to thee—'Richard , my fortune is all thine , and thou shalt share my rank ! ' Because , in Castelcicala , unlike the usages of your native land , he who espouses a Princess becomes a Prince ; and , when you shall be thus exalted , Richard , who will dare to remind you of the misfortunes of your past life ? That is why I rejoice in my present rank and future prospects,—a joy that is experienced solely on account of you ! "
432813	432848	432432	432432	he	874	" Noble - hearted girl ! what kindness — what attention — what devoted love on my part can ever repay thee for these generous feelings — these endearing proofs of the tenderest attachment ! "
432849	432865	432867	432867	Isabella	1066	" Do you think that I should love you , Richard , as I do , "
432869	432950	432867	432867	Isabella	1066	" if I did not know the generosity of your soul — if I did not appreciate all your virtues ? I am well aware that , unfortunately , you are not rich ; and yet you sacrificed — nobly sacrificed your property to release my parent from a gaol ! Oh ! how can I ever forget that conduct of yours ? You speak of repaying me for my affection : how much do I not owe to you ? "
434121	434255	434303	434303	I	0	" I can not sufficiently express my admiration of your noble and generous conduct in having liquidated the debts for which I was detained in the Queen 's Bench prison . I now repay , with unfeigned and heart - felt gratitude , that sum which you advanced , for my necessities , in a manner so honourable to your own nature and so eminently useful to me at that period . I need not say how deeply I regret the injurious suspicions which I entertained concerning you on a certain occasion : but circumstances were too powerfully combined against you to admit of any other impression . You will forgive me — for I ask your pardon : I sincerely apologise for all I may have said or done on that occasion . "
434441	434629	434429	434429	your	874	" One more subject must not be forgotten . I am well aware that you are not as wealthy as you once were . Thank God , my pecuniary means have ceased to be a subject of anxiety to me . You aided me when I was in need and in distress : allow me to offer you a trifling assistance towards enabling you to build up your fortunes . This is an object , which , with your great talents , you can not fail to accomplish . Remember , I do not offer this small aid as an acquittal of my deep obligation towards you : no — my gratitude is intense — and the circumstances under which you befriended me leave me ever your debtor . But as a friend , I offer you the use of my purse;—as a friend I place in your hands a sum of money which you can use during your pleasure , and return to me at your convenience . Should that sum be insufficient to forward your views , hesitate not to apply to me for more . "
434659	434665	434666	434666	ALTERONI	1047	" Your very sincere friend , "
434668	435192	434666	434666	ALTERONI	1047	" Markham picked up the cheque : it was for five thousand pounds . We must endeavour to explain the nature of the feelings which the contents of the Prince 's letter created within him . He saw with delight that the illustrious exile once more addressed him as a friend , and that all suspicions of his guilt had been extirpated from the mind of that nobleman . But , on the other hand , the barrier between himself and Isabella seemed to be rendered insuperable by the positive terms in which the Prince bade him eradicate his passion from his bosom . That barrier was no doubt twofold : the father of Isabella never could consent to the union of his daughter with one whom the world had stamped with ignominy , although innocent:—and , chiefly , the Italian Prince — the probable heir to a throne — might aspire to a far , far higher connexion for his child . Then Richard 's thoughts were directed to the handsome sum of money which the Prince had placed at his disposal ; and he could not do otherwise than admire the delicate manner in which it was proffered,—a manner that scarcely admitted of a refusal . And yet Richard was resolved to return the surplus above the amount which he had disbursed to procure the Prince 's liberation from prison . Thus was it with mingled feelings of joy and melancholy that Markham reviewed the contents of that letter . Still he clung to Hope,—for Isabella had bade him hope ; and he thought that the same good Providence which had thus far reconciled him to the father of his beloved , might in time accomplish more striking miracles in his favour . But , alas ! it must indeed be a miracle that could link his fate with the high destinies of the ducal house of Castelcicala ! Isabella , instead of being the daughter of an obscure count , was the only child of one who , if he were not to become himself the sovereign of the most powerful petty state in Europe , would at all events occupy a station next only to the sovereign whenever circumstances should allow him to return to his native land . But , on the other hand , Isabella was faithful and true ; and what might not be expected from woman 's love ? In a word , Markham was rather inclined to hope than to despair ; and the incidents of that morning imparted to his soul a solace which was a recompense for much , very much of past suffering . Having partaken of some refreshment , Richard returned to London , and repaired to the bank where the cheque was made payable . He only drew for the amount actually due to him , and desired that the surplus might be retained in behalf of Count Alteroni ( under which name the Prince was known at the bankers ' establishment ) . On his return home , Richard addressed the following letter to the Italian nobleman : — "
435241	435296	435212	435212	you	6276	" Your wishes in respect to the attachment which I certainly entertain for the Signora Isabella , shall be so far complied with — that I will not venture to present myself at your abode . As for extinguishing that affection which burns in my heart — mortal power can not accomplish the task . "
435483	435500	435501	435501	I	0	" In the earnest hope that happiness and health may attend upon yourself and amiable family , "
435508	435516	435517	435518	RICHARD MARKHAM	874	" Your most grateful and faithful servant , "
435520	436093	435517	435518	RICHARD MARKHAM	874	" It will be seen that the tone of this letter was somewhat constrained ; but , although Richard endeavoured to write with apparent ease , as if ignorant of his correspondent 's real rank , he could not forget that he was addressing himself to the Prince of Castelcicala . ALAS ! that we should be compelled to turn from such bright scenes as woman 's love and lovers ' hope , to deeds of infamy and crime . But so goes the world ; and no faithful historian can venture to deviate from the rule . Sad , and dismal , and dark , are many of the phases which this narrative has yet to show ; but we can also promise our reader that there will not be wanting bright and cheering scenes to afford relief to his eye . Chequered , indeed , are the ways of life : varied and diversified are all its paths . And , oh ! let him who is wearied with the load of existence , while wending through the rough and craggy places of the world , and when rudely jostled by the world 's unfeeling crowd,—let him remember that there is another sphere beyond , where the ways are smooth and pleasant , and where the voice of lamentation is never heard,—a sphere where angels alone shall be the guides of the elect , and where the sound of grateful harmony shall never cease,—a sphere , whose name is Heaven ! Again we say , alas ! that we should be compelled to divert the attention of our reader from scenes of mundane bliss and the contemplation of the purest love , to deeds of iniquity and hatred . But to our task . It was about five o'clock in the evening of the day that witnessed the incidents of the two preceding chapters , and that had succeeded the night on which the unhappy Viola had signed a deed surrendering up half her property to her unprincipled husband,—that the Resurrection Man returned home to his dwelling in Globe Town . But before he ascended to the apartments inhabited by himself and his mistress with a fearful name , he entered the lower part of the building , and , having lighted a candle , descended to the subterranean vaults . In the first place he went into a cell opposite to that which was still tenanted by Viola , who , it will be remembered , had received a solemn promise to be restored to her own abode that evening at nine o'clock . The Resurrection Man entered the cell to which we have alluded , and which was empty . He raised a stone from the floor , and drew from a hole of about a foot deep , a large leathern bag , the contents of which sent forth the welcome metallic sound of gold as he took it in his hand . The miscreant seated himself upon the cold floor of the cell , and poured forth into his hat the glittering contents of the bag . His eyes sparkled with delight as he surveyed the treasure . He took a few of the coins up in his hand , and let them drop one by one back again into his hat — his glances greedily fixed upon the gold as he thus toyed with it . "
436102	436106	435517	435518	RICHARD MARKHAM	874	" he mused within himself,—"two
436139	436152	435517	435518	RICHARD MARKHAM	874	" he continued , taking a smaller canvass bag from his pocket , "
436238	436297	436225	436225	I	0	" And his countenance suddenly assumed an expression perfectly hideous , as he reflected upon the probability of his career being cut short by the hand of the law . But , in another moment , he grew composed — that is to say , desperately hardened ; and he then proceeded with his occupation and his musings . "
436348	436354	436363	436365	the grand swag	12262	fund;"—and here the miscreant smiled . "
436357	436361	436363	436365	the grand swag	12262	" he continued , "
436414	436685	436410	436412	Mr. Anthony Tidkins	998	" And here the Resurrection Man laughed outright:—it was a horrible chuckle — the triumph of a miscreant of a most atrocious nature . But he was happy — happy after his own fashion ; — happy in counting and contemplating the produce of his turpitude . While he was consigning his wealth to the larger bag , and gloating over the gold as he passed it through his hand , he was suddenly alarmed by a slight sound in the passage . It seemed like a low footstep . He listened , but it was not repeated . For nearly a minute did he remain motionless , and almost breathless , in a state of painful attention ; but not another sound met his ear . Then , recovering from the state of uneasy suspense into which that incident had thrown him , he rose from the floor , and hurried into the passage which divided the two rows of cells . All was quiet . Ashamed of himself for his childish alarm , and muttering a curse at his folly for having given way to that fear , he returned into the cell , buried his treasure and covered the place with the stone . He then carefully locked the door of the dungeon . He crossed the passage , and proceeded gently to open the door leading into the cell occupied by Viola . When he entered this vault , he found the lamp extinguished ; but by the glare of his candle , he perceived the unhappy woman stretched in a profound slumber upon the bed . "
436689	436693	436410	436412	Mr. Anthony Tidkins	998	" he muttered to himself,—"and
436860	437040	436849	436849	Tomlinson	1005	" At that instant an idea struck the Resurrection Man . Hitherto he had worked as Chichester 's agent , and by Chichester 's directions , in this affair : what if he were to turn the business to some good account for himself ? The lady had only parted with half her property : she had eight thousand pounds left . Might not all , or a decent portion of this sum thus remaining , pass into the hands of the Resurrection Man ? His mode of treatment had elicited the first concession : some additional horrors might extort a further grant . The idea was excellent : fool that he was for not having thought of it before ! Thus reasoned Anthony Tidkins . The more he thought of the new plot which had just entered his head , the more he grew enamoured of it . He was well aware that neither Chichester nor Tomlinson would dare to adopt measures to resist his will ; and with a grin of savage delight , he exclaimed aloud , "
437049	437331	436849	436849	Tomlinson	1005	" He then removed the bottle of wine from the cell , so that when Viola awoke she might not repeat her dose — supposing that she should be ignorant of the cause of her long lethargic slumber ; for the Resurrection Man was not aware of the sudden effect which it had produced upon her , but imagined that the drugged liquid was only powerful enough to operate gradually . He next replenished the lamp with oil from a bottle which stood in one corner of the cell , and , having lighted the lamp , withdrew , carefully bolting and locking the door behind him . He ascended from the subterranean prison , replaced the stone trap - door , and issued from the ground - floor of the house . He observed that the door leading into the alley was locked as he had left it when he entered ; and this circumstance reassured him relative to the little incident which had temporarily disturbed him when counting his money in the cell . Many circumstances combined to put the Resurrection Man into an excellent humour . He had that day added four hundred pounds to his hidden treasure ; he saw business of all kinds multiplying upon his hands , and promising a golden harvest ; and he had hit upon a scheme which , he had no doubt , would produce him a larger sum than he had ever yet realised even in his dreams . It was therefore with a smiling countenance that he entered the up - stairs room where the Rattlesnake was busily employed in spreading the contents of her cupboard upon the table . "
437345	437349	437350	437350	I	0	" he exclaimed . "
437407	437408	437393	437393	I	0	" "
437415	437439	437413	437413	Tony	1061	" returned the woman , with a manner even more wheedling and fawning than she had ever before used towards her terrible paramour . "
437448	437449	437452	437452	Meg	1291	" "
437491	437492	437481	437485	two gentlemen close by here	12273	" "
437506	437511	437495	437495	you	1061	" said the Rattlesnake . "
437556	437557	437549	437549	Meg	1291	" "
437565	437602	437549	437549	Meg	1291	" returned Margaret Flathers , affecting a smile as if she were quite satisfied ; but as she turned to replace the meat in the cupboard , her countenance involuntarily assumed an expression of mysterious triumph . "
437610	437616	437549	437549	Meg	1291	" said the Resurrection Man : "
437636	437650	437651	437651	I	0	" Tidkins lighted his pipe , and smoked for some moments in silence . "
437658	437666	437667	437667	you	1291	" he exclaimed , after a pause ; "
437707	437708	437699	437699	I	0	" "
437711	437725	437726	437726	You	1291	" said Margaret , as she mixed two glasses of gin and water . "
437792	437875	437788	437790	Miss Margaret Flathers	1291	" The Resurrection Man laughed at this joke — as he considered and meant it to be ; and the Rattlesnake , who never dared to thwart him in any thing , and who apparently had some additional motive to humour him on this occasion , hastened to comply with his request — or rather command . She accordingly related her history , the phraseology of which we have taken the liberty materially to correct and amend , in the following manner . "
438250	438392	438234	438235	a girl	27847	" How my infancy was passed I , of course , can only form an idea by the mode of treatment generally adopted towards babies in the mining districts , and under such circumstances as those connected with my birth . My mother would , perhaps , come up from the pit once , in the middle of the day , to give me my natural nourishment ; and when I screamed during her absence , the little girl , who acted as my nurse , most probably thrust a teaspoonful of some strong opiate down my throat to make me sleep and keep me quiet . Many children are killed by this treatment ; but the reason of death , in such cases , is seldom known , because the Coroner 's assistance is seldom required in the mining districts . "
438706	438796	438702	438704	an infant mind	12313	" I remember at this moment what my feelings were then — as well as if the incident I am relating had only occurred yesterday . During the day - light I had seen the lofty chimneys giving vent to columns of dense smoke , the furnaces putting forth torrents of lurid flame , and the coke - fires burning upon the ground : but that was the first time I had ever beheld those meteors blazing amidst utter darkness ; and I was afraid — I was afraid . "
439153	439302	439311	439311	my	0	" But to return to my first descent into the pit . My mother , who was dressed in a loose jacket , open in front , and trousers ( which , besides her shoes , were the only articles of clothing on her , she wearing neither shift nor stockings ) , leapt upon the clatch - iron as nimbly as a sailor in the rigging of his ship . She then received me from the outstretched arm of the old woman , and made me sit in the easiest and safest posture she could imagine . But when I found myself being gradually lowered down into a depth as black as night , I felt too terror - struck even to cry out ; and had not my mother held me tight with one hand , I should have fallen precipitately into that hideous dark profundity . "
439721	439851	439715	439715	I	0	" You must remember that I had been reared in a complete state of mental darkness ; and that no enlightened instruction had dispelled the clouds of superstition which naturally obscure the juvenile mind . I could not read : I had not even been taught my alphabet . I had not heard of such a name as Jesus Christ ; and all the mention of God that had ever met my ears , was in the curses and execrations which fell from the lips of my father , my mother , her acquaintances , and even the little girl who had nursed me . You can not wonder , then , if I was so appalled , when I first found myself in that strange and terrific place . "
440012	440179	440180	440181	My mother	27004	" Well , we went on , until we suddenly came upon a scene that astonished me not a little . The passage abruptly opened into a large room,—an immense cave , hollowed out of the coal in a seam that I since learnt to be twenty feet in thickness . This cave was lighted by a great number of candles ; and at a table sate about twenty individuals — men , women , and children — all at breakfast . There they were , as black as negroes — eating , laughing , chattering , and drinking . But , to my surprise and disgust , I saw that the women and young girls were all naked from the waist upwards , and many of the men completely so . And yet there was no shame — no embarrassment ! But the language that soon met my ears!—I could not comprehend half of it , but what I did understand , made me afraid ! "
440279	440522	440523	440524	Phil Blossom	1333	" The name of the man for whom my mother worked was Phil Blossom . He was married , but had no children . His wife was a cripple , having met with some accident in the mine , and could not work . He was therefore obliged to employ some one to carry his coal from the place where he worked , to the cart that conveyed it to the foot of the shaft . Until I went down into the mine , my mother had carried the coal for him , and also hurried ( or dragged ) the cart ; but she now made me fill one cart while she hurried another . Thus , at seven years old , I had to carry about fifty - six pounds of coal in a wooden bucket . When the passage was high enough I carried it on my back ; but when it was too low , I had to drag or push it along as best I could . Some parts of the passages were only twenty - two inches in height ; this was where the workings were in very narrow seams ; and the difficulty of dragging such a weight , at such an age , can be better understood than explained . I can well recollect that when I commenced that terrible labour , the perspiration , commingling with my tears , poured down my face . "
440708	440778	440779	440779	I	0	" Phil Blossom was what was called a getter . He first made a long straight cut with a pickaxe underneath the part of the seam where he was working : this was called holing : and as it was commenced low down , the getter was obliged to lie flat on his back or on his side , and work for a long time in that uneasy manner . "
440878	441052	441053	441053	I	0	" Many — many weeks passed away ; and at length I grew quite hardened in respect to those sights and that language which had at first disgusted me . I became familiar with the constant presence of naked men and half - naked women ; and the most terrible oaths and filthy expressions ceased to startle me . I walked boldly into the great cavern which I have before described , and which served as a place of meeting for those who took their meals in the mine . I associated with the boys and girls that worked in the pit , and learnt to laugh at an obscene joke , or to practise petty thefts of candles , food , or even drink , which the colliers left in the cavern or at their places of work . The mere fact of the boys and girls in mines all meeting together , without any control,—without any one to look after them,—is calculated to corrupt all those who may be well disposed . "
441268	441475	441476	441476	You	12388	" If I did not do exactly as Phil Blossom told me , the treatment I received from him was horrible ; and my mother did not dare interfere , or he would serve her in the same manner . He thrashed me with his fist or with a stick , until I was bruised all over . My flesh was often marked with deep wales for weeks together . One day he nipped me with his nails until he actually cut quite through my ear . He often pulled my hair till it literally gave way in his hand ; and sometimes he would pelt me with coals . He thought nothing of giving me a kick that would send me with great violence across the passage , or dash me against the opposite side . On one occasion he was in such a rage , because I accidentally put out the candle which he had to light him at his work , that he struck a random blow at me with his pickaxe in the dark , and cut a great gash in my head . All the miners in pits baste and bray — that is , beat and flog — their helpers . "
441629	441677	441678	441678	I	0	" Deaths from accidents of this nature were seldom , if ever , brought under the notice of the coroner : indeed , to save time , it was usual to bury the poor victims within twenty - four or thirty - six hours after their decease . "
442104	442288	442289	442289	Our	12422	" Again , how can the collier 's home possibly be comfortable ? He makes his wife and children toil with him in the mine : he married a woman from the mine ; and neither she nor her daughters know any thing of housekeeping ? How can disorder be prevented from creeping into the collier 's dwelling , when no one is there in the day - time to attend to it ? Then all the money which they can save from the Tommy - shop , ( of which I shall speak presently ) goes for whiskey . Husband and wife , sons and daughters all look after the whiskey . The habits of the colliers are hereditarily depraved : they are perpetuated from father to son , from mother to daughter ; none is better nor worse than his parents were before him . Rags and filth — squalor and dissipation — crushing toil and hideous want — ignorance and immorality ; these are the features of the collier 's home , and the characteristics of the collier 's life . "
442318	442687	442692	442693	my mother	27004	" But the chief source of poverty and frequent want — amounting at times almost to starvation — amongst persons earning a sufficiency of wages , is the truck system . This atrociously oppressive method consists of paying the colliers ' wages in goods , or partly in goods , through the medium of the tommy - shop . The proprietor of a tommy - shop has an understanding with the owners of the mines in his district ; and the owners agree to pay the persons in their employment once a month , or once a fortnight . The consequence is that the miners require credit during the interval ; and they are compelled to go to the tommy - shop , where they can obtain their bread , bacon , cheese , meat , groceries , potatoes , chandlery , and even clothes . The proprietor of the tommy - shop sends his book to the clerk of the owner of the mine the day before the wages are paid ; and thus the clerk knows how much to stop from the wages of each individual , for the benefit of the shopkeeper . If the miners and their wives do not go to the tommy - shop for their domestic articles , they instantly lose their employment in the mine , in consequence of the understanding between their employer and the shopkeeper . Perhaps this would not be so bad if the tommy - shops were honest ; because it is very handy for the collier to go to a store which contains every article that he may require . But the tommy - shop charges twenty - five or thirty per cent . dearer than any other tradesman ; so that if a collier and his family can earn between them thirty shillings a week , he loses seven or eight shillings out of that amount . In the course of a year about twenty pounds out of his seventy - five go to the tommy - shop for nothing but interest on the credit afforded ! That interest is divided between the tommy - shop - keeper and the coal - mine proprietor . "
442856	442965	442822	442822	you	12433	" The wages , in my time , were subject to great changes : I have known men earn twenty - five shillings a week at one time , and twelve or fifteen at another . And out of that they were obliged to supply their own candles and grease for the wheels of the carts or trams . The cost of this was about three - pence a day . Then , again , the fines were frequent and vexatious : it was calculated that they amounted to a penny a day per head . These sums all went into the coffers of the coal - owners . "
443032	443295	443019	443020	the deceased	3368	" By the time I was twelve years old I was as wild a young she - devil as any in the mines . Like the other females , I worked with only a pair of trousers on . But I would not consent to hurry the trams and skips . I saw that my mother had got a great bald place on her head , where she pushed the tram forward up sloping passages ; and as I was told that even amidst the black and filth with which I was encrusted , I was a good - looking wench , I determined not to injure my hair . I may as well observe that a stranger visiting a mine , and seeing the boys and girls all huddling together , half - naked , in the caves or obscure nooks , could not possibly tell one sex from the other . I must say that I think , with regard to bad language and licentious conduct , the girls were far — far worse than the boys . It is true that in the neighbourhood of the pits Sunday - schools were established ; but very few parents availed themselves of these means of obtaining a gratuitous education for their children . When I was twelve years old , I did not know how to read or write : I was unaware that there was such a book as the Bible ; and all I knew of God and Jesus Christ was through the oaths and imprecations of the miners . "
443668	443983	443984	443984	I	0	" I pondered seriously upon all this ; and every circumstance that occurred , and every scene around me , tended to strengthen my resolution to quit an employment worse than that of a galley - slave . I saw my mother wasting all her best energies in that terrible labour , and yet remaining poor — beggared ! Scarcely enough for the present — not a hope for the future ! Sometimes I wept when I contemplated her , although she had but little claims on my sympathy or affection ; nevertheless , when I saw her bald head — her scalp thickened , inflamed , and sometimes so swollen , that it was like a bulb filled with spongy matter , and so painful that she could not bear to touch it,—when I heard her complain of the dreadful labour of pushing the heavy corves and trams with her sore head,—when I perceived her spine actually distorted with severe work ; her stomach growing so weak that she frequently vomited her food almost as soon as it was eaten ; her heart so seriously affected that the intervals of violent palpitation frequently made her faint ; her lungs performing their functions with difficulty ; her chest torn with a sharp hacking cough , accompanied by the expectoration of a large quantity of matter of a deep black colour , called by colliers the black - spit;—when I saw her thus overwhelmed with a complication of maladies — dying before my eyes , at the age of thirty - three!—when I looked around , and beheld nine out of ten of all the persons employed in the pits , whether male or female , similarly affected,—I shuddered at the bare idea of devoting my youth to that horrible toil , and then passing to the grave while yet in the prime of life ! "
444054	444464	444465	444465	I	0	" One morning my candle had accidentally gone out , and I was creeping along the dark passage to the spot where Phil Blossom was working , to obtain a light from his candle , when I heard him and my mother conversing together in a low tone , but with great earnestness of manner . Curiosity prompted me to stop and listen . ' Are you sure that is the case ? ' said Phil.—'Certain , ' replied my mother . ' I shall be confined in about five months . '—'Well , ' observed Phil , ' I do n't know what 's to be done . My old woman will kick up the devil 's delight when she hears of it . I wish she was out of the way : I would marry you if she was . '—Then there was a profound silence for some minutes . It was broken by the man , who said , ' Yes , if the old woman was out of the way you and I might get married , and then we should live so comfortable together . I 'm sure no man can be cursed with a wife of worse temper than mine . '—'Yes , ' returned my mother , ' she is horrible for that . '—'Do you think there would be much harm in pushing her down a shaft , or shoving her head under the wheel of your tram , Bet ? ' asked Phil , after another pause.—'There would be no harm , ' said my mother , ' if so be we wern't found out . '—'That 's exactly what I mean , ' observed Phil.—'But then , ' continued my mother , ' if she did n't happen to die at once , she might peach , and get us both into a scrape . '—'So she might , ' said Phil.—'I'll tell you what we might do , ' exclaimed my mother , in a joyful tone : ' does n't your wife come down at one to bring you your dinner?'—'Yes , ' replied Phil Blossom : ' that 's all the old cripple is good for . '—'Well , then , ' pursued my mother , ' I 'll tell you how we can manage this business . '—Then they began to whisper , and I could not gather another word that fell from their lips . "
444846	445301	445302	445305	One of the boys	12484	" Shortly before one o'clock that same day my mother came to the place where I was carrying the coals , and gave me a butter - cake ( as we called bread and butter ) , telling me that she was going up out of the mine , as she must pay a visit to the tommy - shop for some candles and grease for herself , and some tobacco for Phil Blossom . I did not dare utter a word expressive of the suspicions which I entertained ; but I felt convinced that this proceeding was in some way connected with the subject of the conversation which I had overheard . A strange presentiment induced me to leave my place of work , and creep along the passage to the foot of the shaft , in order to see whether Phil 's wife would come down at the usual time with his bait . Several half - marrows and foals ( as we called the young lads who pushed the trams ) were at the end of the passage just at the foot of the shaft ; and we got into conversation . It is a very curious thing to look up a shaft from the very bottom ; the top seems no bigger than a sugar - basin . Well , the boys and I were chattering together about different things , when the click of the clatch - harness at the top of the shaft fell upon my ears . I peeped up and saw some one get on the clatch : then the creaking of the wheel and roller was heard . ' Here comes some one 's bait , I dare say , ' observed one of the half - marrows.—I wish it was mine , ' said another ; ' but I never get any thing to eat from breakfast - time till I go home at night . '—Scarcely were these words spoken when a piercing scream alarmed us : there was a rushing sound — the chains of the harness clanked fearfully — and down came a woman with tremendous violence to the bottom of the pit , the clatch rattling down immediately after her . A cry of horror burst from us all ; the poor creature had fallen at our very feet . We rushed forward ; but she never moved . The back part of her head was smashed against a piece of hard mineral at the bottom of the shaft . But her countenance had escaped injury ; and as I cast a hasty glance upon it , I recognised the well - known face of Phil Blossom 's crippled wife ! "
445387	445581	445383	445383	I	0	" In due time the cause of the accident was ascertained . It appeared that my mother had gone up the shaft , but when she got to the top she struck her foot so forcibly against the upright post of the machinery , that she lamed herself for the time . The old woman who presided over the machinery ( as I have before said ) very kindly offered to go to the tommy - shop for her , on condition that she would remain there to work the handle for people coming up or going down . This was agreed to . The very first person who wanted to go down was Mrs. Blossom ; and my mother alleged that the handle unfortunately slipped out of her hand as she was unwinding the rope . This explanation satisfied the overseer of the mine : the intervention of the coroner was not deemed necessary;—my mother appeared much afflicted at the accident : Phil Blossom mourned the death of his wife with admirable hypocrisy;—the corpse was interred within forty - eight hours;—and thus was Phil 's wife removed without a suspicion being excited ! "
445733	446415	446416	446418	The poor fellow	2922	" I had not a penny in my pocket , nor a friend on the face of the earth to whom I could apply for advice , protection , or assistance . All that stood between me and starvation , that I could see , was a piece of bread and some cheese , which I had taken with me when I left home . I walked as far as I could without stopping , and must have been about six miles from the pit where I had worked , when evening came on . It was November , and the weather was very chilly . I looked round me , almost in despair , to see if I could discover an asylum for the night . Far behind me the tremendous chimneys and furnaces vomited forth flames and volumes of smoke ; and the horizon shone as if a whole city was on fire : but in the spot where I then found myself , all was drear , dark , and lonely . I walked a little farther , and , to my joy , espied a light . I advanced towards it , and soon perceived that it emanated from a fire burning in a species of cave overhung by a high and rugged embankment of earth belonging to a pit that had most probably ceased to be worked . Crouching over this fire was a lad of about fifteen , clothed in rags , dirty , emaciated , and with starvation written upon his countenance . I advanced towards him , and begged to be allowed to warm myself by his fire . He answered me in a kind and touching manner ; and we soon made confidants of each other . I told him my history , only suppressing my knowledge that the death of Phil Blossom 's wife arose from premeditation , instead of accident , as I did not wish to get my mother into a scrape , although I had no reason to have any regard for her . The lad then acquainted me with his sad tale . He was an orphan ; and his earliest remembrance was experienced in a workhouse , of which , it appeared , he had become an inmate shortly after his birth , his parents having been killed at the same time by the explosion of a fire - damp in the pit in which they had worked . When the lad was eight years old , the parish authorities apprenticed him to a miner , who gave him the name of Skilligalee , in consequence of his excessive leanness . This man treated him very badly ; but the poor boy endured all for a period of seven years , because he had no other asylum than that afforded him by his master . ' At length , ' said the boy , ' a few weeks ago , master got hurt upon the head by the falling in of some coal where he was working ; and from that moment he acted more like a madman than a human being . He used to seize me by the hair , and dash me against the side of the pit : sometimes he flogged me with a strap till my flesh was all raw . I could stand it no longer ; so , about three weeks ago , I ran away . Ever since then I have been living , I can scarcely tell how . I have slept in the deserted cabins on the pits ' bank , or in the old pits that have done working : I have got what I could to eat , and have even been glad to devour the bits of candles that the colliers had left in the pits . All this is as true as I am here.[85 ] Yesterday I found some matches in a pit ; and that is how I have this good fire here now . But I am starving ! ' "
446583	446805	446571	446571	I	0	" ' Come with me , ' said Skilligalee . I did not ask any questions , but followed him . He led the way in silence for upwards of half an hour , and at length lights suddenly shone between a grove of trees . Skilligalee leapt over a low fence , and then helped me to climb it . We were then in a meadow planted with trees — a sort of park , which we traversed , guided by the lights , towards a large house . We next came to a garden ; and , having passed through this enclosure , we reached the back part of the premises . Skilligalee went straight up to a particular window , which he opened . He then crept through , and told me to wait outside . In a few minutes he returned to the window , and handed me out a large bundle , wrapped up in a table - cloth . He then crept forth , and closed the window . We beat a retreat from the scene of our plunder ; and returned to the cave . The fire was still blazing , and Skilligalee fed it with more fuel , which he obtained by breaking away the wood from an old ruined cabin close by . "
447026	447132	447156	447156	Skilligalee	1337	" We then partook of some of the cold meat and fine white bread which the pantry had furnished ; and , while we thus regaled ourselves , we debated what we should do with the silver forks and spoons . I said before that I was decently dressed ; but my companion was in rags . It was accordingly agreed that I should go to the nearest town in the morning , dispose of the plate , purchase some clothes for Skilligalee , and then rejoin him at the cave . This matter being decided upon , we laid down and went to sleep . "
447428	447714	447395	447395	he	27233	" At the expiration of that period , I was again placed before the magistrate ; and , to my surprise , I found Skilligalee in the court . He was still clothed in his rags , and looked more wretched and famished than when I first saw him . I gave him a look , and made a sign to assure him that I would not betray him ; but the moment the case was called , he stood forward and declared that he alone was guilty,—that he had robbed the house , and that I was merely an instrument of whom he had made use to dispose of the proceeds of the burglary . I was overcome by this generosity on his part ; and both the magistrate and the owner of the property were struck by the avowal . The latter declared that he did not wish to prosecute : the former accordingly inflicted a summary sentence of imprisonment for a few weeks upon Skilligalee . He then questioned me about my own condition ; and I told him that I had worked in a mine , but that I had been compelled to run away from home in consequence of the ill treatment I received at the hands of my mother . I expressed my determination to put an end to my life sooner than return to her ; and the gentleman , whose house had been robbed , offered to provide for me at his own expense , if the magistrate would release me . This he agreed to do ; and the gentleman placed me as a boarder in a school kept in the town by two elderly widows . "
447826	448002	447821	447821	his	12546	" During the whole of that period I had never heard of my mother , or Phil Blossom . I now felt some curiosity to discover what had become of them ; so , one day , having obtained a holiday for the purpose , I went over to the pit where I had myself passed so many miserable years . The same old woman , who had presided at the handle of the roller that raised or lowered the clatch - harness , during the period of my never - to - be - forgotten apprenticeship , was there still . She did not recognise me — I was so altered for the better . Clean , neatly dressed , stout , and tall , I could not possibly be identified with the dirty , ragged , thin , and miserable - looking creature who had once toiled in that subterranean hell . I accosted the old woman , and asked her if a woman named Betsy Flathers or Blossom worked in the mine . "
448006	448542	448003	448004	Bet Blossom	1338	" ejaculated the old woman : ' why , she 's been dead a year!'—'Dead ! ' I echoed . ' And how did she die?'—'By falling down the shaft , to be sure , ' answered the old woman.—Although I entertained little affection for my mother , absence and a knowledge of her character having destroyed all feelings of that kind , I could not hear this intelligence without experiencing a severe shock.—'Yes , ' continued the old woman , ' it was a sort of judgment on her , I suppose , for she herself let a poor creature fall down some four or five years ago , when she took my place at the handle here for a few minutes while I went to the tommy - shop for her . She married the husband of the woman who was killed by the fall ; and every body knew well enough afterwards that there was n't quite so much neglect in the affair as she had pretended at the time , but a something more serious still . However , there was no proof ; and so the thing was soon forgot . Well , one day , about a year ago , as I said just now , Phil Blossom came up to me and asked me to run to the tommy - shop to fetch him some candles . I told him to mind the wheel , and he said he would . It seems that a few minutes after I had left on his errand , his wife came up the clatch ; and , according to what a lad , who looked up the shaft at the time , says , she had just reached the top , when she fell , harness and all , the whole pit echoing with her horrible screams . She died the moment she touched the bottom . Phil Blossom was very much cut up about it ; but he swore that the handle slipped out of his hand , and then went whirling round and round with such force that he could n't catch it again . I own people did say that Phil and his second wife led a precious dog - and - cat kind of a life ; but the overseer thought there was no reason to make a stir about it , and there the matter ended . '—'And what has become of Phil Blossom ? ' I inquired.—The old woman pointed down the shaft , as much as to say that he was still working in the mine.—'Did they have any children ? ' I asked.—'Bet had one , I believe , ' said the old woman ; ' but it died a few days after it was born , through having too large a dose of Godfrey 's Cordial administered to make it sleep . '—I gave the old woman a shilling , and turned away from the place , by no means anxious to encounter Phil Blossom , who , I clearly perceived , had rid himself of my mother by the same means which she had adopted to dispose of his first wife . "
448867	448903	448864	448864	we	12569	" I did not neglect my appointment . Skilligalee was delighted to see me again ; and he proposed that I should leave service , and live with him . I consented ; and — — "
449469	449482	449483	449483	she	1291	" Fortune seemed to favour me this afternoon when I watched him , "
449488	449501	449483	449483	she	1291	" and surely it will not desert me at the last moment . "
449890	449895	449881	449883	that unhappy lady	12608	" Where am I ? "
449896	449903	449905	449906	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Hush ! not a word , "
449912	449923	449905	449906	the Rattlesnake	1292	" I am come to save you — follow me ! "
449994	450000	450002	450003	the latter	2065	" Fear nothing , lady , "
450005	450016	450002	450003	the latter	2065	" only be silent , and lose not a moment . "
450100	450104	450105	450105	she	27628	" O heavens ! "
450113	450119	450105	450105	she	27628	" if he should come ! "
450120	450127	450129	450129	Viola	1319	" Have you the right key ? "
450135	450144	450129	450129	Viola	1319	" The one that has opened it before , "
450146	450168	450105	450105	she	27628	Margaret;—"but it appears that — it will not turn — and , ah ! my God , I hear steps approaching ! "
450207	450214	450215	450215	she	1319	" It was a false alarm , "
450251	450255	450262	450262	her	1291	" Thank God ! "
450277	450287	450289	450289	Viola	1319	" Come — let us not lose a moment , "
450538	450544	450546	450547	Margaret Flathers	1291	" We are now safe , "
450549	450555	450546	450547	Margaret Flathers	1291	" We are now safe , "
450560	450568	450546	450547	Margaret Flathers	1291	" Still this place is lonely — — "
450569	450580	450546	450547	Margaret Flathers	1291	" And if that dreadful man were on our track — "
450581	450588	450546	450547	Margaret Flathers	1291	" We might yet repent — — "
450589	450599	450546	450547	Margaret Flathers	1291	" Yes — we might yet repent our proceeding . "
450703	450712	450714	450715	the Rattlesnake	11700	" Which way are you going , madam ? "
450746	450754	450756	450757	Mrs. Chichester	1319	" My own house is close by , "
450759	450783	450756	450757	Mrs. Chichester	1319	" But you — whither are you going ? Will it not be better for you to come with me — and — — "
450784	450789	450791	450792	Margaret Flathers	1291	" No , lady , "
450794	450815	450791	450792	Margaret Flathers	1291	" you are not aware who and what I am , or you would not make me that generous offer . "
450816	450819	450821	450821	Viola	1319	" Generous ! "
450823	450860	450821	450821	Viola	1319	" have you not saved me from a fearful dungeon ? It is true that my persecutors promised to release me this evening : but , alas ! their word was not to be depended upon . "
450861	450866	450868	450868	Margaret	1291	" Ah ! madam , "
450870	450906	450868	450868	Margaret	1291	" if you trusted to Anthony Tidkins to give you your freedom , you would have been woefully disappointed — unless , indeed , he had no longer any interest in keeping you a prisoner . "
450907	450912	450914	450914	Viola	1319	" Well — well , "
450916	450940	450914	450914	Viola	1319	" we will talk of all that hereafter . In the mean time , I insist upon your accompanying me to my home . "
450941	450954	450956	450956	Margaret	1291	" I will see you safe to your own door , madam , "
450958	450966	450956	450956	Margaret	1291	" and there I shall leave you . "
450967	450979	450981	450981	Viola	1319	" And why will you refuse an asylum at my abode ? "
450983	450991	450993	450994	the Rattlesnake	1292	" I dare not remain in London , "
450996	451037	450993	450994	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Oh ! you know not the perseverance , the craft , and the wickedness of the man from whose power you have just escaped . But there is one favour , madam , which you can grant me — — "
451038	451042	451044	451044	Viola	1319	" Name it , "
451046	451057	451044	451044	Viola	1319	" it is already conferred , if within my power . "
451058	451069	451071	451072	the Rattlesnake	1292	" You can have no difficulty in fulfilling my request , "
451074	451170	451071	451072	the Rattlesnake	1292	" because it is simple , and consists only in forbearance . I mean , madam , that you will amply reward me for the service I have been able to render you , if you will promise not to take any measures to punish or molest Anthony Tidkins . He has been more or less good to me ; and I should not like to know that he was injured through me . Besides , his revenge would only be the more terrible , if ever you or I again fell into his hands . "
451171	451181	451183	451183	Viola	1319	" I give you the promise which you require , "
451185	451210	451183	451183	Viola	1319	" although I must confess that it is somewhat repugnant to my feelings to allow such a wretch to be at large with impunity . "
451211	451220	451071	451072	the Rattlesnake	1292	" But for my sake , lady — — "
451221	451248	451183	451183	Viola	1319	" For your sake , I give my most solemn pledge not to do aught that may injure that man on account of his past offences . "
451249	451254	451183	451183	Viola	1319	" A thousand thanks ! "
451259	451307	451183	451183	Viola	1319	" Let us now proceed . But , heavens ! you have got nothing on your head nor on your shoulders ; and I did not notice that before ! Take my bonnet and shawl , madam — I am more accustomed to the cold than you . "
451308	451311	451313	451313	Viola	1319	" No , "
451315	451333	451313	451313	Viola	1319	" in five minutes I shall be at my own house . Come — let us proceed . "
451377	451384	451385	451385	she	1319	" In another hour , madam , "
451388	451404	451385	451385	she	1319	" I shall not be in London . Then only shall I consider myself safe . "
451405	451467	451366	451367	the Rattlesnake	1292	" At least allow me to supply you with some money for your immediate purposes . I have none about me , and I know not whether my husband has left a single shilling in the house ; but any of my tradesmen in the neighbourhood will honour my draft ; and if you will walk in for a few minutes — "
451468	451487	451489	451489	she	12640	" Thank you , madam — thank you for your kind consideration ; but I am well supplied ; "
451515	451520	451521	451521	she	1319	" At all events , "
451524	451541	451521	451521	she	1319	" should you ever require a friend , do not hesitate to apply to Mrs. Chichester . "
451542	451546	451548	451549	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Mrs. Chichester ! "
451551	451591	451548	451549	the Rattlesnake	1292	" surely I have heard that name before ? Oh ! I recollect — I have taken to the post - office letters from Tidkins to a Mr. Chichester , who , I suppose , must be your husband . "
451592	451596	451598	451598	Viola	1319	" The same , "
451605	451610	451612	451613	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Farewell , madam , "
451615	451634	451612	451613	the Rattlesnake	1292	" I feel that I shall not breathe with freedom until I am far beyond London . Farewell . "
451635	451638	451640	451641	Mrs. Chichester	1319	" Farewell , "
451701	451717	451719	451719	Viola	1319	" Make fast the door with chain and bolt , and bring me the key , "
451730	451751	451719	451719	Viola	1319	" See also that the shutters of the windows are well secured ; and bring me your master 's pistols . "
451752	451762	451764	451765	the servant	2459	" Mr. Chichester came this morning early , ma'am , "
451767	451777	451764	451765	the servant	2459	" and took away every thing belonging to him . "
451778	451783	451785	451785	Viola	1319	" Heaven be thanked ! "
451787	451842	451843	451843	she	1319	" Perhaps he will molest me no more ? God grant that the separation may be eternal ! Nevertheless , secure the door and the windows : this house is not safe ! To - morrow I shall leave it , and hire lodgings in the very heart of London . There , perhaps , "
451848	451857	451843	451843	she	1319	" no violence can be offered to me ! "
452515	452526	452528	452530	Mary - Anne	1264	" We have only known each other one short week , "
452532	452572	452528	452530	Mary - Anne	1264	" and yet I feel as if you were sent to me by heaven to become my friend and confidant — for , oh ! it seems to me as if my soul nourished a secret which consumes it . "
452573	452595	452597	452598	the signora	5333	" An accident made us acquainted ; and that very circumstance immediately inspired me with a deep interest in your behalf , "
452600	452625	452597	452598	the signora	5333	" There are occasions when two persons become more intimate in a few short days , than they otherwise would in as many years . "
452626	452635	452637	452639	Mary - Anne	1264	" You echo my own feelings , signora , "
452641	452655	452637	452639	Mary - Anne	1264	" and your goodness makes me desire to deserve and gain your friendship . "
452656	452668	452670	452670	Isabella	1066	" Your wish is already accomplished , my dear Miss Gregory , "
452672	452703	452670	452670	Isabella	1066	" You have my friendship ; and if you think me worthy of your confidence , I can sympathise with your sorrows , even if I can not remove them . "
452704	452720	452722	452724	Mary - Anne	1264	" How have you divined that the confidence I would impart is associated with grief ? "
452728	452734	452736	452738	the beautiful Italian	30104	" I will tell you , "
452740	453143	452736	452738	the beautiful Italian	30104	" When you were riding on horseback , accompanied by your father , along this road a week ago , I observed you from my own chamber . Even at that distance , I perceived something about you that immediately inspired me with interest . I followed you with my eyes until you were out of sight : and then I still continued to think of you — wondering , with that idiosyncrasy of thought which often occurs during a leisure half - hour , who you were . At length you returned . You were a few paces in front of your father ; and I observed that the horse you rode was a spirited one . Then occurred the accident : the moment you were thrown so rudely off against the very gate of our shrubbery , I precipitated myself down the stairs , and , calling for the servants as I descended , hurried to your assistance . You can not remember — because you were insensible — that I was the first to reach the spot , where your father had already raised you from the ground . Mr. Gregory was distracted : he thought that you were lost to him for ever . I , however , ascertained in a moment that you still breathed ; and I directed the servants to convey you to the house . While you were still stretched in a state of insensibility upon my own bed , I contemplated you with increasing interest . Then , when you awoke at length , and spoke,—and when I conversed with you,—it seemed as if I were irresistibly attracted towards you . I was , indeed , delighted when my father proposed to Mr. Gregory to allow you to remain a few days with us until you should be completely recovered from the effects of your fall . Your father consented , and he left you with us . It was not long before I perceived that you nourished a profound grief;—I observed the frequent abstraction of your manner — I noticed your pensive mood . I thought within myself , ' Is it possible that one so young and interesting should already be acquainted with sorrow ? ' From that hour I have felt deeply on your account — for , alas ! I myself have known what are the effects of grief ! "
453144	453147	453149	453151	Mary - Anne	1264	" Signora , "
453159	453208	453149	453151	Mary - Anne	1264	" I can never repay you for this kind interest which you manifest towards me . I feel that I should be happier were I to tell you all that grieves me ; but I tremble — lest you should think me very foolish , and very indiscreet ! "
453209	453218	453220	453220	Isabella	1066	" Foolish we may all be at times , "
453222	453232	453220	453220	Isabella	1066	" but indiscreet I am convinced you never were . "
453233	453254	453256	453258	Mary - Anne	1264	" Is it not indiscreet to nurse a sentiment whose hopes can never be realised ? Is it not indiscreet , "
453272	453280	453256	453258	Mary - Anne	1264	" to love one who loves another ? "
453281	453287	453289	453289	Isabella	1066	" No — not indiscreet , "
453293	453303	453289	453289	Isabella	1066	" for what mortal has power over the heart ? "
453304	453317	453319	453321	Mary - Anne	1264	" Signora , love is not then a stranger to your breast ! "
453336	453351	453353	453353	Isabella	1066	" I should be unworthy of your confidence , were I to withhold mine , "
453355	453380	453381	453381	she	33350	" Yes — my troth is plighted to one than whom no living soul possesses more generous , more noble feelings : and yet , "
453388	453413	453381	453381	she	33350	" there are obstacles in the way of our union — obstacles which , alas ! I sometimes think , can never be overcome ! "
453414	453431	453433	453435	Mary - Anne	1264	" Ah ! lady , while I can now feel for you — feel most deeply , "
453437	453473	453433	453435	Mary - Anne	1264	" I am , nevertheless , rejoiced that you have thus honoured me with your confidence . It removes any hesitation — any alarm , on my part , to unburden my soul to you ! "
453474	453483	453485	453485	Isabella	1066	" Speak , my dear Mary - Anne , "
453487	453502	453485	453485	Isabella	1066	" you will at least be certain to receive sympathy and consolation from me . "
453503	453512	453514	453516	Mary - Anne	1264	" I shall then reveal my sentiments unreservedly , "
453518	454093	453514	453516	Mary - Anne	1264	" I have before mentioned to you that I have two brothers , who are now at college . A few months ago , they were preparing for their collegiate course of study , and were residing at home in Kentish Town . My father obtained for them the assistance of a tutor — a young gentleman who had once been wealthy , but who had been reduced to comparative poverty . Oh ! it was impossible to see that young man without feeling an interest in him . When I first heard that a tutor was engaged for my brothers , I immediately pictured to myself a confirmed pedagogue — shabby , dirty , dogmatic , and ugly . How greatly then was I astonished , when I was introduced to an elegant and handsome young man , of polished manners , agreeable conversation , entirely unassuming , courteous , and affable ? There was a partial air of melancholy about him ; but his eyes were lighted with the fire of intellect , and his noble forehead seemed to be adorned with that unartificial crown of aristocracy which nature bestows upon her elect . Alas ! woe to me was the day when that young man first entered my father 's dwelling . The interest I felt for him soon augmented to a degree , that I was miserable when he was away . But , when he was present , oh ! then my heart seemed to bound within me like a fawn upon the hills ; and my happiness was of the most ravishing description — I was gay , frolicksome , and playful : no laugh of a child was so hearty , so sincere as mine ! His voice was music to my ears ! He taught me drawing ; but I was too happy to sit still for many minutes together — too happy to sit next to him ! And yet I did not understand my own feelings : in fact , I never stopped to analyse them . I was carried along by a whirlwind that left me no leisure for self - examination . When he was absent , my only thought was upon what he had said when present , and how happy I should be when he came once more . I had no more idea of the true nature of the sentiment that animated my soul , than I have at this instant of what constitutes the happiness of heaven . I knew that I felt happy when he was there : I know that those feel happy who dwell above;—but I was as ignorant then of what formed my felicity , as I now am of the bliss experienced by those who inhabit the Almighty 's kingdom . Thus a few weeks passed away ; and then my father announced his intention of allowing a holiday for a short period . I remember — as well as if it were an event of yesterday — that this arrangement caused me serious displeasure ; because I understood that our tutor would cease to visit us during the suspension of the studies . I expressed my annoyance in plain terms ; but this ebullition on my part was most probably considered a specimen of girlish caprice , or the airs of a spoiled child . And now , signora — now — — "
454094	454099	454101	454103	the Italian lady	33350	" Call me Isabella , "
454107	454114	454101	454103	the Italian lady	33350	" Now , my dear Isabella , "
454120	454164	454116	454118	Mary - Anne	1264	" I come to that part of my narrative which involves an indiscretion that may appear grave in your eyes — though , God knows , I was at the time entirely ignorant of the imprudence of the step which I was taking . "
454165	454187	454189	454189	Isabella	1066	" I am prepared to allow every extenuation for one so young , so artless , and so inexperienced as yourself , "
454191	454199	454189	454189	Isabella	1066	" Ah ! how kind you are , "
454211	454408	454201	454203	Mary - Anne	1264	" But let me not hesitate to reveal the indiscretion into which I was hurried by feelings of a new and powerful nature , I called upon the young tutor at his own residence ! And then , how nobly did he behave ! how generously did he act ! He explained to me — by degrees , and in the most delicate manner possible — the impropriety of the step which I had taken : he gave me an insight into those rules of feminine propriety , a breach of which can scarcely be extenuated by the plea of guilelessness;—in a word , he opened my eyes to the position in which I had placed myself ! But , alas ! what did I learn at the same time ? He told me that he was attached to a young lady , who was very beautiful . It then struck me , with lightning rapidity , that I had no right to offer my friendship ( for still I did not dream of love ) to one on whom another heart had claims ; and I left him with a sincere apology for my conduct . "
454409	454418	454420	454424	the pure - minded Isabella	12684	" I admit that your indiscretion was great , "
454426	454445	454420	454424	the pure - minded Isabella	12684	" but no one possessing a generous heart could hesitate to sympathise with you , rather than blame . "
454446	454452	454454	454456	Mary - Anne	1264	" For days and days , "
454458	454655	454454	454456	Mary - Anne	1264	" I struggled with my feelings . I still believed that all I experienced towards the object of my interest was friendship . But when he resumed his attendance , I found that it was impossible to conquer the sentiments which agitated my bosom . God knows — God knows , Isabella , how I reasoned with myself upon the state of mind in which I existed ! I prayed to heaven to relieve me from the doubts , the anxieties , the uneasiness , which constantly oppressed me , by restoring me to that state of perfect happiness which was mine ere I knew that being who , in spite of himself , exercised so powerful an influence over me . At length my father sent me suddenly , and without a day 's warning , to pass a week with some particular friends at Twickenham . I was at first inclined to remonstrate with him at this proceeding ; and then it struck me that it would be well if I were to cease to exist under the spell which the frequent presence of the tutor at the house seemed to throw around me . "
454656	454676	454678	454678	Isabella	1066	" And all this time you were still unaware of the true nature of the feelings which animated you ? "
454680	454689	454691	454693	Mary - Anne	1264	" Oh ! yes — I was indeed , "
454695	455111	454691	454693	Mary - Anne	1264	" but a fearful occurrence was speedily destined to open my eyes ! I remained a few days with my kind friends at Twickenham , and then returned home . I there learnt that the tutor had ceased to attend at the house , as my brothers were to proceed , at the commencement of January , to college . I know not whether my father had some motive for the conduct which he thus pursued , in abruptly dismissing the tutor and sending me away while he adopted that step ; nor can I say whether any particular reason prompted him to do all that he could to amuse my mind on my return home . It is , nevertheless , certain that he exerted himself to provide amusements for me : he purchased two horses , and accompanied me in frequent equestrian exercises ; he took me to concerts and the theatres ; and supplied me with entertaining books of travel and adventure , music , and pictures . But my mind was intent only upon one absorbing idea ; nor could it be weaned from that feeling which it nursed in favour of the young tutor . I , however , acceded to all my father 's plans of diversion ; and it was one evening at the theatre that the veil fell from my eyes ! I accompanied my father to witness a new drama . The action of the piece was deeply interesting ; the poetry was of a nature to touch the inmost soul . There was a passage in which the heroine described her hopeless love : I listened — I drank in every word — I hung upon each syllable of that fine speech as if my own destiny were intimately linked with the scene enacting before me . As she proceeded , I was painfully surprised by the similitude existing between the feelings that she described and that I felt . At length a light dawned in upon my soul;—then did I begin to comprehend the real nature of the sentiments that filled my own soul;—then could I read my own heart ! I perceived that I loved tenderly , deeply , unalterably ! I heard no more of the drama — I saw nothing more of its progress : I sate absorbed in deep reflection upon the conviction that had so suddenly reached me . When I awoke from my reverie , the tragedy — — "
455112	455116	455118	455118	Isabella	1066	" A tragedy ? "
455122	455173	455118	455118	Isabella	1066	" Yes — the tragedy was finished , and the author , holding the hand of the heroine of his piece , stood before the public . Merciful heavens ! the great tragic writer who had thus suddenly burst upon the world , was no other than the young tutor ! "
455174	455178	455180	455180	Isabella	1066	" The tutor ! "
455190	455203	455205	455207	Mary - Anne	1264	" Yes — he whom I had just discovered that I loved , "
455209	455216	455218	455218	Isabella	1066	" May I inquire his name ? "
455231	455241	455243	455244	Miss Gregory	1264	" There can be no indiscretion in revealing it , "
455246	455262	455243	455244	Miss Gregory	1264	" for it is not probable that you have ever heard of Mr. Richard Markham . "
455263	455267	455269	455269	Isabella	1066	" Unhappy girl ! "
455286	455346	455269	455269	Isabella	1066	" it is now my duty to return your confidence with a reciprocal frankness . But , alas ! what I am about to say can not tend to soothe your sorrows , since — as I fondly believe — it will only confirm you in the impression that the affections of him whom you love are fixed elsewhere . "
455347	455354	455356	455358	Mary - Anne	1264	" You speak mysteriously , Isabella , "
455360	455366	455356	455358	Mary - Anne	1264	" pray , explain yourself . "
455367	455375	455377	455378	the signora	5333	" I will — and without reserve , "
455388	455409	455377	455378	the signora	5333	" So far from Mr. Richard Markham being a stranger to me , Mary - Anne , he is — — "
455410	455414	455416	455417	Miss Gregory	1264	" He is — "
455421	455444	455416	455417	Miss Gregory	1264	" He is the hope of my happiness — the one to whom my vow of constancy and love is pledged — — "
455445	455453	455455	455457	Mary - Anne	1264	" You the object of his attachment ! "
455465	455483	455455	455457	Mary - Anne	1264	" Oh ! forgive me — forgive me , that I have dared to love him also ! "
455484	455496	455498	455498	Isabella	1066	" Alas ! dear girl , I have nothing to forgive , "
455502	455518	455498	455498	Isabella	1066	" I deeply — deeply compassionate your lot . And , oh ! believe me , "
455523	455566	455580	455582	Mary - Anne	1264	Princess,—"believe me when I say that no feeling of petty jealousy — no sentiment unworthy the honourable affection which I bear towards Richard Markham — can ever impair the friendship that has commenced , and shall continue , between you and me ! "
455567	455578	455580	455582	Mary - Anne	1264	" Oh ! how noble is your disposition , Isabella ! "
455584	455658	455580	455582	Mary - Anne	1264	" But your generous assurance shall not meet with an ungrateful return . So far from feeling jealous of you,—envious I must be , to some extent,—I offer you the most sincere congratulations on your engagement to one who is so well worthy of your love — in spite of what the world may say against him;—for that he could be guilty of the deed of which that horrible man accused him — — "
455659	455665	455667	455667	Isabella	1066	" He is not guilty , "
455671	455686	455687	455688	The signora	5333	" The story is a long one ; but I will tell thee all . "
455723	455746	455716	455716	Isabella	1066	" Oh ! I knew that he was all of honourable , great , and generous , that human nature could be ! "
455774	455783	455784	455784	she	1264	" Oh ! well might he have said , "
455802	455834	455795	455795	she	1264	signora,—"well might he have said that his heart was devoted to a lady who was very beautiful ! And he might also have observed , as good as she was lovely ! "
455835	455844	455846	455846	Isabella	1066	" Nay — you must not flatter me , "
455848	455861	455863	455865	Mary - Anne	1264	" You need not hesitate to hear the truth from my lips , "
455867	455887	455863	455865	Mary - Anne	1264	" God grant that I may live to see you happily united : I shall then die in peace . "
455888	455900	455902	455902	Isabella	1066	" It is wrong to talk of dying at your age , "
455904	455917	455902	455902	Isabella	1066	" Time will mitigate that passion which has made you unhappy — — "
455918	455937	455939	455941	Mary - Anne	1264	" Oh ! Isabella , do you believe that true and sincere love can ever succumb to time ? "
455946	455960	455962	455964	the Italian lady	33350	" Time can not extinguish it ; but time may soften its pangs , "
455973	455992	455994	455995	Miss Gregory	1264	" But time will only ripen , and not eradicate , the canker which gnaws at the heart , "
455997	456001	456002	456002	she	1264	" and mine , "
456021	456107	456108	456108	she	1264	said,—"mine has received a wound whose effects may be comparatively slow , but which is not the less mortal . A few years , perhaps , and my earthly career must end . I shall wither like the early flowers , that peep forth prematurely to greet a deceptive gleam of sunshine which they mistake for spring:—I shall pass away at that age when my contemporaries are in the full enjoyment of life , vigour , and happiness ! Yes — I feel it here — here;"—and
456116	456123	456125	456125	Isabella	1066	" No , my dear friend , "
456132	456165	456125	456125	Isabella	1066	" your prospect is not so gloomy as you would depict it . There is one star that burns in the same heaven which is above us all;—and that star is Hope . "
456166	456169	456171	456173	Mary - Anne	1264	" Hope ! "
456177	456197	456171	456173	Mary - Anne	1264	" ah ! where does hope exist for me ? Is not hope extinguished in my heart for ever ? "
456198	456208	456210	456210	Isabella	1066	" In the one sense , hope is dead , "
456214	456394	456210	456210	Isabella	1066	" but hope beams not only in one sphere . The attentions of your friends — the kindness of your relations , will combine to cheer your path ; and surely this conviction must be allied to hopes of tranquillity , peace , and even happiness ! Consider , Mary - Anne — you have a father who is still in the vigour of his years : you will live for him ! You have brothers who must soon enter upon their respective careers in the great world : you must live for them ! You have friends who are devoted to you : you will live for them also ! Oh ! do not speak of death with levity : do not seem to invite its presence ! We do not live for ourselves only : we live for others . To yield to those feelings which facilitate the ravages of sorrow and encourage the inroads of grief , is to perpetrate a slow suicide . God and man alike require that we should war against our misfortunes ! "
456411	456417	456409	456409	Isabella	1066	" answered Mary - Anne : "
456444	456445	456409	456409	Isabella	1066	" "
456470	457174	457175	457176	Mr. Wentworth	1209	" answered Isabella . Mary - Anne sighed , but gave no answer . The two maidens now felt wearied with the somewhat lengthy walk which they had taken ; and they accordingly retraced their steps to the mansion . IT was evening ; and a cheerful fire burned in the grate of the drawing - room at Markham - Place . Mr. Monroe and his daughter were seated in that apartment ; the former dozing in an arm - chair , the latter reading a novel . Richard was engaged in a literary pursuit in his library . From time to time Miss Monroe laid aside her book , and fell into meditation . Not that she had any particular subject for her reflections ; but the events of her life , when taken together , constituted a theme from which it was impossible to avert her attention for any lengthened period . There was also a topic upon which she pondered more frequently as time passed on . She knew that in the course of nature,—especially after the rude shocks which his constitution had received from mental suffering and bodily privation,—her father could not live much longer . Then , she was well aware that she could not continue to dwell beneath the same roof with Richard Markham;—and her pride revolted against the idea of receiving a direct eleemosynary assistance from him in the shape of a pecuniary allowance . She had some few pounds treasured up in a savings bank , and which she had saved from her salary when engaged at the theatre ; but this sum would not maintain her long . She therefore looked , with occasional anxiety , to the necessity of adopting some course that should obtain for her a livelihood . Of all the avocations in which she had been engaged , she preferred that of the stage ; and there were times when she seriously thought of returning to the profession , even during her father 's life - time . In sooth , it was a pity that one of the brightest ornaments of female loveliness should have been lowered by circumstances from the pedestal of virtue and modesty which she would have so eminently adorned . Should her transcendent loveliness captivate the heart of any individual whose proposals were alike honourable and eligible , how could she accept the hand thus extended to her ? She must either deceive him in respect to that wherein no man likes to be deceived ; or she must decline the chance of settling herself advantageously for life . These were the alternatives;—for in no case could she reveal her shame ! Her fate was not , therefore , a happy one ; and the reader need not marvel if she now and then found reflections of a disagreeable nature stealing into her soul . She was now past twenty years of age : and in spite of the severe trials which she had endured , the sweet freshness of her youthful charms was totally unimpaired . Her faultless Grecian countenance,—her classically - shaped head,—her swan - like neck,—her symmetrical form,—her delicate hands and feet,—all those charms which had been perpetuated in the works of so many artists — these elements of an almost superhuman beauty still combined to render her passing lovely ! O Ellen ! the soul of the philanthropist must mourn for thee,—for thou wast not wrongly inclined by nature . On a purer being than thou wast , ere misery drove thee in an evil moment to an evil course , the sun never shone:—and now thou hast to rue the shame which thine imperious destiny , and not thy faults , entailed upon thee ! But to our tale . Old Mr. Monroe was dozing in the arm - chair ; and Ellen had once more turned her eyes upon her book , when Marian entered the room . She perceived at a glance that Mr. Monroe was asleep ; and , placing her finger upon her lip to enjoin silence , she put a note into Ellen 's hand , saying it the same time in a low whisper , "
457197	457214	457196	457196	Miss.	1116	" Marian then withdrew . Ellen tore open the note , and read as follows : — "
457264	457268	457252	457253	My servant	3451	" DAVID WENTWORTH . "
457349	457391	457340	457343	that gentleman 's wife	12704	" The danger is over — the crisis is past ! Do not alarm yourself — my husband no longer fears for your son 's life . He , however , deemed it to be his duty to send for you . "
457392	457405	457407	457407	Ellen	1117	" Oh ! he did well — he acted kindly and considerately , "
457409	457424	457425	457426	Mrs. Wentworth	1213	" But let me assure myself that my boy is no longer in danger . "
457805	457811	457813	457813	Ellen	1117	" My child is saved , "
457818	457826	457813	457813	Ellen	1117	" Has my father inquired for me ? "
457827	457832	457801	457803	the faithful Marian	33634	" No , miss , "
457837	457854	457801	457803	the faithful Marian	33634	" He is still in the drawing - room ; and Mr. Markham is with him . "
457855	457864	457866	457866	Ellen	1117	" They are up late to - night , "
457868	457872	457873	457873	she	1117	" But I , "
457876	457894	457873	457873	she	1117	" am weary in mind and body , and shall at once repair to my own room . "
458084	458100	458070	458070	Ellen	1117	" My dear father , in the name of heaven , what is the matter ? "
458101	458107	458109	458111	the old man	2222	" O God ! Ellen , "
458122	458155	458109	458111	the old man	2222	" tell me that it is not true — say but one word , to assure me that you are the pure and spotless girl I have always deemed you to be ! "
458156	458159	458161	458163	the young lady	4262	" Father ! "
458173	458182	458161	458163	the young lady	4262	" why do you ask me that question ? "
458183	458192	458194	458196	the old man	2222	" Because a fearful suspicion racks my brain , "
458198	458219	458194	458196	the old man	2222	" and I could not retire to rest until I knew the truth — be that truth what it may . "
458220	458230	458232	458232	Ellen	1117	" My dear father — you alarm me cruelly ! "
458250	458257	458259	458261	the old man	2222	" In one word , Ellen , "
458263	458272	458259	458261	the old man	2222	" what is the meaning of that letter ? "
458335	458357	458327	458327	she	1117	" Forgive me ! forgive me — my dear , dear father ! Do not curse your wretched — wretched daughter ! "
458448	458466	458432	458432	he	885	" My God ! that I had died ere I had experienced this bitter — bitter hour ! "
458512	458553	458504	458504	she	1117	" Forgive me , my dear father . Oh ! if my child were here , I would hold it in my arms towards you ; and , when its innocent countenance met your eyes , you would pardon me ! "
458554	458567	458569	458570	Mr. Monroe	885	" Ellen ! Ellen ! thou hast broken thy father 's heart , "
458580	458651	458573	458573	his	885	" Oh ! heaven be thanked that thy mother has been snatched from us ! But tell me , unhappy girl , who is the villain that has dishonoured thee — for , in the moment of my intense agony , when I read the fatal letter that disclosed thy dishonour and marked the name of thy child , I vilely — ungratefully accused our generous benefactor of thy ruin . "
458652	458661	458663	458663	Ellen	1117	" What ! Richard?—oh ! no , no ! "
458709	458714	458716	458718	the old man	2222	" Ellen ! Ellen ! "
458720	458736	458716	458718	the old man	2222	" Ellen — my dearest daughter , Ellen — oh ! I have killed her ! "
458750	458755	458757	458759	the agonised father	12751	" Water ! water ! "
458761	458770	458757	458759	the agonised father	12751	" she is insensible — she is dying ! "
458818	458823	458825	458827	the old man	2222	" My sweet child , "
458836	458878	458825	458827	the old man	2222	" live — live for me : all shall be forgiven — all forgotten . I was harsh to thee , my Ellen — to thee who have always been so fond , so tender , and so good to me . "
458879	458889	458891	458891	Marian	1264	" Leave her , sir , for the present , "
458893	458910	458891	458891	Marian	1264	" allow her to compose herself . This discovery has been almost too much for her ! "
458911	458915	458825	458827	the old man	2222	" I will , "
458920	458941	458942	458944	The old man	2222	" You must stay with her , good Marian ; and in the morning I will come and see her . "
459030	459049	459051	459053	the old man	2222	" And you persist in refusing to acquaint me with the name of him who has dishonoured you ? "
459061	459076	459078	459078	Ellen	1117	" Oh ! my dear father , why will you persist in torturing me ? "
459080	459091	459078	459078	Ellen	1117	" Do you think that I have not suffered enough ? "
459092	459109	459111	459111	Monroe	1117	" Oh ! I can well believe that you have suffered , Ellen — suffered profoundly , "
459113	459397	459111	459111	Monroe	1117	" for you were reared in the ways of virtue ; and you could not have fallen into those of crime without a remorse . Suffered ! but how have I not suffered during the last few hours ! When I read that fearful secret , I became a madman . I had but two ideas : my daughter was a mother , and her child 's name was Richard ! What could I think ? I went straight to the room where our benefactor was sitting : I closed the door ; I approached him , with the rage of a demon in my breast , and I said , ' Villain ! is my daughter 's honour the price of the hospitality which you have shown towards us ? ' He was thunderstruck ; and I showed him the letter . He burst into tears , exclaiming , ' Could you believe me capable of such infernal atrocity ? ' Then we reasoned together ; we conversed upon the subject ; and his noble frankness of manner convinced me that I had erred — grossly erred ! He implored me to allow the night to pass ere I revealed to you the appalling discovery which I had made : he dreaded the effects of my excited state of mind ; he thought that rest would calm me . But there was no rest for me ! I retired to my room ; and there — when alone — I felt that I could not endure meditation . I came to your chamber ; and then — O God ! the doubt to which I had yet so fondly clung was dissipated . "
459398	459408	459410	459410	Ellen	1117	" My dear father , if you knew all , "
459414	459470	459410	459410	Ellen	1117	" you would pity me — oh ! you would pity me ! Do not think that I surrendered myself to him who is the father of my child , in a moment of passion : do not imagine that the weakness was preceded by affection on my part for him who led me astray ! "
459471	459479	459481	459482	Mr. Monroe	885	" Unhappy girl , what mean you ? "
459484	459508	459481	459482	Mr. Monroe	885	" Would you rob yourself of the only plea of extenuation which woman in such a case can offer ? Speak , Ellen ! "
459509	459523	459525	459525	Ellen	1117	" I will tell you all — that is , all I know , "
459531	459594	459525	459525	Ellen	1117	" You remember that when we returned to live in that horrible court in Golden Lane , the second time we were reduced to poverty,—you remember what fearful privations we endured ! At length our misery reached a point when it became intolerable ; and one morning you set out with the determination of seeking relief from the bounty of Richard Markham . "
459595	459601	459603	459603	Monroe	1117	" I well remember it , "
459605	459608	459603	459603	Monroe	1117	" Proceed . "
459609	459631	459525	459525	Ellen	1117	" You can then call to mind the circumstance of my absence when you returned home to our miserable abode — — "
459632	459651	459653	459655	the old man	2222	" I do — I do : hours passed — I had gold — and you were absent ! "
459661	459670	459672	459672	Ellen	1117	" And when I returned home — late — "
459695	459704	459674	459674	her	1117	" did I not bring you gold also ? "
459705	459709	459711	459711	Monroe	1117	" Merciful heavens ! "
459718	459755	459711	459711	Monroe	1117	" say no more , Ellen — say no more — or I shall go mad ! Oh , God ! I comprehend it all ! You went and sold yourself to some libertine for gold ! "
459771	459780	459782	459782	Ellen	1117	" Father — dear father , calm yourself , "
459784	459821	459822	459822	she	1117	" I could not see you want — I had no faith in the success of your appeal to him who has since been our benefactor — I thought that there was but one resource left;—but , "
459843	459924	459822	459822	she	1117	" I call my God to witness that I acted not thus for myself . Oh , no ! death sooner should have been my fate . But you , my dear father , you wanted bread ; you were starving ; and that was more than I could bear ! I sinned but once — but once ; and never , never have I ceased to repent of that fatal step — for my one crime bore its fruit ! "
459963	459979	459956	459956	he	5334	" Ellen , my daughter , it is for me to ask pardon of you ! "
459980	459994	459996	459997	Miss Monroe	1117	" No , say not so , dear father — say not so ! "
460013	460038	460039	460039	she	1117	" No , my dear father , it was not your fault , if misery drove me to despair . But now you perceive , "
460044	460061	460062	460062	she	1117	" that I was more to be pitied than to be blamed ; and — and , "
460075	460092	460039	460039	she	1117	" you understand why I can not tell you who was the father of my child ! "
460290	460301	460303	460303	Richard	874	" A parent must not be separated from her offspring , "
460305	460318	460303	460303	Richard	874	" henceforth , Ellen , that infant must be nurtured by thee . "
460319	460332	460334	460334	Ellen	1117	" Oh ! good , generous friend , my more than brother ! "
460361	460364	460366	460367	Mr. Monroe	885	" Richard , "
460369	460385	460386	460386	Marian	1264	" you possess the noblest soul that ever yet blessed or adorned a human being . "
460409	460429	460430	460430	Ellen	1117	ears:—"Fear nothing : I was sent to fetch the child ; and Mr. Wentworth will keep your secret inviolably . "
460545	460580	460536	460536	she	1264	" Our benefactor 's goodness deserves every explanation from us ; tell him the extent of my misfortune — reveal to him the origin and cause of my shame — let nothing be concealed . "
460581	460584	460586	460586	Richard	874	" Ellen , "
460588	460672	460586	460586	Richard	874	" I know all ! Forgive me , but I reached the door of your room when you were telling your sad tale to your father ; and I paused — because I considered that it was improper to interrupt you at such a moment . And , if I overheard that affecting narrative , it was not a mean curiosity which made me stop to listen — it was the deep interest which I now more than ever feel in your behalf . "
460673	460681	460683	460683	Ellen	1117	" And you do not despise me ? "
460690	460694	460696	460696	Richard	874	" Despise you ! "
460698	460725	460696	460696	Richard	874	" I deeply sympathise with you ! Oh , no ! you are not criminal ; you are unfortunate . Your soul is pure and spotless . "
460726	460737	460739	460739	Ellen	1117	" But the world — what will the world think , "
460741	460753	460739	460739	Ellen	1117	" when I am seen with this babe in my arms ? "
460754	460766	460696	460696	Richard	874	" The world has not treated you so well , Ellen , "
460770	460806	460807	460807	he	874	" that its smiles should be deeply valued . Let the world say what it will , it would be unnatural — inhuman — to separate a mother from her child ; unless , indeed , "
460810	460824	460807	460807	he	874	" it is your desire that that innocent should be nursed among strangers . "
460825	460832	460834	460834	Ellen	1117	" Oh , no — no ! "
460836	460883	460834	460834	Ellen	1117	" But my unhappy situation shall not menace your tranquillity ; nor shall the tongue of scandal gather food from the fact of the residence of an unwedded mother beneath your roof . I will retire , with my father , to some secluded spot — — "
460884	460887	460889	460889	Markham	874	" Ellen , "
460891	460967	460889	460889	Markham	874	" were I to permit that arrangement , it would seem as if I were not sincere in the interest and commiseration , instead of the blame , which I ere now expressed concerning you . No : unless you and your father be wearied of the monotonous life which you lead with me , here will you both continue to dwell ; and let the world indulge in its idle comments as it will . "
460968	460982	460984	460984	Ellen	1117	" Your benevolence finds a reason for every good deed which you practise , "
460986	461017	460984	460984	Ellen	1117	" Ah ! Richard , you should have been born a prince , with a princely fortune : how many thousands would then have been benefited by your boundless philanthropy . "
461018	461032	461034	461034	Richard	874	" My own misfortunes have taught me to feel for those of others , "
461036	461074	461034	461034	Richard	874	" and if the world were more anxious than it is to substitute sympathy for vituperation , society would not be the compound of selfishness , slander , envy , and malignity , that it now is . "
461075	461084	461086	461086	Ellen	1117	" It is settled , then , Richard , "
461088	461100	461086	461086	Ellen	1117	" that my babe shall henceforth experience a mother 's care ! "
461292	461302	461304	461305	this gentleman	2368	" I am off to France to - morrow , "
461314	461335	461304	461305	this gentleman	2368	" and I called to see if I could do any thing for you on that side of the water . "
461336	461341	461343	461343	Greenwood	903	" No , nothing , "
461345	461357	461343	461343	Greenwood	903	" Do you propose to make a long stay in France ? "
461358	461371	461373	461373	Chichester	886	" I shall honour Paris with my presence for about a month , "
461375	461380	461382	461382	Greenwood	903	" During which time , "
461388	461407	461382	461382	Greenwood	903	" you will contrive to get rid of all the money which Mrs. Viola Chichester so generously supplied . "
461408	461412	461414	461414	Chichester	1319	" Generously indeed ! "
461419	461522	461414	461414	Chichester	1319	" So far from thinking of running through the money , I hope to double it . Although the public gambling - houses have been abolished in France , there is plenty of play at the private clubs . But you must not imagine that I have a perfect fortune in my possession : the means adopted to obtain the cash cost a mint of money : then were five hundred pounds to Tomlinson for his assistance ; five hundred to you for your aid , advice , and advances—(there is a splendid alliteration for you!)—and three hundred to poor Anthony Tidkins . "
461523	461527	461529	461529	Greenwood	903	" Poor indeed ! "
461531	461552	461529	461529	Greenwood	903	" According to what you told me , the miserable wretch must be in a blessed state of pecuniary nudity . "
461553	461559	461561	461561	Chichester	1319	" It was perfectly true , "
461563	461627	461561	461561	Chichester	1319	" When he came to meet me and Tomlinson on the night that Viola was to be released , in the dark alley adjoining his house , he was like a furious hyena . It seems that he had awoke up ten minutes before the hour appointed for our meeting , and then discovered his loss as I before described it to you . "
461628	461642	461644	461644	Greenwood	903	" I should not like to have such a man as my enemy , "
461648	461762	461768	461768	Greenwood	903	" Nor I either . Bless me , how he did swear ! I never heard such imprecations come from a human being 's mouth before . He vowed that he would undertake no other business , nor devote himself to any other pursuit , until he had traced the woman who had robbed him , and avenged himself upon her . Flaying alive , he said , was too good for her ! Well , I gave him twenty pounds , poor devil , through good nature ; and Tomlinson gave him ten through fear ; for it appears that this Tidkins exercises some extraordinary influence over that cowardly stock - broker — "
461763	461766	461768	461768	Greenwood	903	" Ahem ! "
461770	461776	461777	461777	he	903	" And so poor Tidkins , "
461780	461795	461777	461777	he	903	" did not set out on his travels after the thief empty - handed ? "
461796	461815	461768	461768	Greenwood	903	" By no means . But he is a useful fellow , and one might want him again . "
461816	461819	461821	461821	Greenwood	903	" True , "
461823	461861	461821	461821	Greenwood	903	" he is one of the necessary implements which men of the world must make use of at times , to carve out their way to fortune . Hare you heard any thing of your beloved wife ? "
461862	461873	461875	461875	Chichester	1319	" Nothing more than what I have already told you , "
461877	461922	461924	461924	Chichester	1319	" She has given up her abode at the Cambridge Heath gate , and taken apartments at a house in the very heart of the City , and where there are plenty of other lodgers . She is determined to be secure . However , "
461930	461960	461924	461924	Chichester	1319	" so long as she holds her tongue about that little matter — which she seems inclined to do — she need not fear any further molestation from me . "
461961	461980	461982	461982	Greenwood	903	" I question whether you would have released her that evening , had she not made her escape , "
461984	461991	461982	461982	Greenwood	903	" Oh , indeed I should , "
461995	462079	461982	461982	Greenwood	903	" I did not wish to push things too far ; and I really believe that another week 's confinement in that terrible place , which I have described to you , would have turned her mad in reality . Then again , I should have been afraid of that cowardly , snivelling fool , Tomlinson , who insisted upon accompanying me to ensure her release . That man has every inclination to be a downright rogue ; but he lacks the courage . "
462080	462089	462091	462091	Greenwood	903	" Have you seen your friend Harborough lately ? "
462093	462137	462091	462091	Greenwood	903	" To tell you the truth , he is going with me on my present expedition to Paris . His name , you know , sounds well : Sir Rupert Harborough , Bart . , son - in - law of Lord Tremordyn,—eh ? "
462138	462151	462153	462153	Greenwood	903	" His name must be somewhat worn out , I should imagine , "
462162	462169	461982	461982	Greenwood	903	" Have you seen Lady Cecilia ? "
462170	462237	462091	462091	Greenwood	903	" No : she has her suite of apartments , and Sir Rupert has his — they do not interfere with each other . Sir Rupert , however , notices that Lady Cecilia has a great many visitors of the male sex ; and amongst others , an officer of the grenadier guards , seven feet seven inches high , including his bear - skin cap . "
462238	462250	462252	462252	Greenwood	903	" Indeed ! Lady Cecilia is then becoming a confirmed demirep , "
462265	462273	462275	462275	Chichester	1319	" There is no doubt of that , "
462277	462290	462275	462275	Chichester	1319	" But you seem up to your neck in business as usual . "
462291	462305	462307	462307	Greenwood	903	" Yes : I am busily engaged in behalf of the Tory party , "
462309	462351	462307	462307	Greenwood	903	" The future Premier has great confidence in me . I have bought him over seven votes from the Whig side during the recess ; and the moment the Tories succeed to power , I shall be rewarded with a baronetcy . "
462352	462363	462365	462365	Chichester	1319	" You are making your way famously in the world , "
462371	462378	462380	462380	Greenwood	903	" Pretty well — pretty well , "
462447	462457	462444	462444	Greenwood	903	" What have you done with the old man ? "
462458	462480	462482	462482	Tomlinson	1005	" I have taken a lodging for him in an obscure street of Bethnal Green , and there he is residing , "
462484	462490	462492	462492	Greenwood	903	" My plan was better , "
462496	462524	462492	462492	Greenwood	903	" you should have had him locked up in one of Tidkins 's subterranean cells , and allowed three or four shillings a week for his maintenance . "
462525	462528	462530	462530	Tomlinson	1005	" Impossible ! "
462534	462551	462530	462530	Tomlinson	1005	" I could never have acted so unmanly — so ungrateful — so atrocious a part . "
462552	462560	462562	462565	the Member of Parliament	8234	" Well , just as you please , "
462567	462575	462562	462565	the Member of Parliament	8234	" of course , you know best . "
462576	462584	462586	462586	Tomlinson	1005	" We will not discuss that point , "
462588	462626	462628	462629	Mr. Greenwood	903	" That is precisely what I said some time since to a deputation from the free and independent electors of Rottenborough , when they sent to remonstrate with me on a certain portion of my parliamentary conduct , "
462664	462667	462669	462670	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Ah ! "
462672	462679	462669	462670	Mr. Greenwood	903	" any thing wrong , Marian ? "
462680	462702	462704	462705	the servant	2459	" That may be according to the light in which you view the news I am come to communicate , sir , "
462707	462723	462704	462705	the servant	2459	" In a word , Miss Monroe 's father and Mr. Markham have discovered all . "
462724	462732	462734	462734	Greenwood	903	" All ! no — not all ! "
462740	462747	462734	462734	Greenwood	903	" surely Ellen could not — — "
462748	462756	462758	462758	Marian	1264	" When I said all , sir , "
462760	462787	462758	462758	Marian	1264	" I was wrong . Mr. Monroe and my master have discovered that Miss Ellen is a mother ; and her child is now with her . "
462788	462795	462797	462797	Greenwood	903	" What ! at Markham Place ? "
462799	462804	462797	462797	Greenwood	903	" Yes , sir . "
462805	462823	462758	462758	Marian	1264	" And is it known also who — what person — the father , I mean — — "
462824	462836	462838	462838	Marian	1264	" Miss Ellen has maintained that a profound secret , sir , "
462840	462844	462846	462846	Greenwood	903	" Thank heaven ! "
462852	462861	462846	462846	Greenwood	903	" But Mr. Wentworth — the surgeon — — "
462862	462931	462758	462758	Marian	1264	" He has also promised to remain dumb relative to what little he knows . You are best aware , sir , whether Miss Monroe has studied your wishes , or your interests , in remaining silent herself relative to you , and in recommending Mr. Wentworth , through me , to say nothing that may prove that she is really acquainted with the father of her child . "
462932	462944	462946	462946	Greenwood	903	" But how was the discovery made ? Tell me all , "
462949	462993	462946	462946	Greenwood	903	" The explanation is short . Mr. Wentworth sent a note relative to the health of the infant , last evening , to Miss Monroe ; and she inadvertently left it upon the table in the same room where her father was sitting . "
462994	463008	463010	463010	Greenwood	903	" And her father — and Richard — Mr. Markham , I mean , "
463012	463026	463010	463010	Greenwood	903	" are acquainted but with the bare fact that she is a mother ? "
463027	463053	463055	463055	Marian	1264	" That is all , sir . But , oh ! if you only knew the excuse that Miss Ellen made to avoid additional explanations , "
463057	463071	463055	463055	Marian	1264	" you yourself — yes , you , sir , would be affected . "
463072	463078	463080	463080	Greenwood	903	" What was that excuse ? "
463082	463095	463097	463097	Marian	1264	" I can scarcely believe for one moment that it was true , "
463108	463114	463116	463119	the Member of Parliament	8234	" But what was it ? "
463123	463172	463116	463119	the Member of Parliament	8234	" Oh ! she spoke of the misery to which her father and herself had once been reduced , and she said that , prompted by despair , she had sold her virtue to one whom she knew not — whom she had never seen before nor since . "
463173	463180	463182	463182	Greenwood	903	" Ah ! she said that , "
463184	463194	463182	463182	Greenwood	903	" And were her father and your master satisfied ? "
463195	463255	463256	463257	Mr. Greenwood	903	" The old man wept well - nigh to break his heart , and Mr. Markham said that henceforth the child should stay with its mother in his house . Oh ! sir , there lives not a man of nobler disposition than my master : he is all that is generous , humane , liberal , and upright ! "
463333	463444	463329	463330	Mr. Greenwood	903	" You will proceed immediately to the abode of Mr. Wentworth , at Holloway : you will hand him from me this bank - note for fifty pounds ; and you will say to him these words : ' As the child has been removed through an unforeseen occurrence from your care , its father sends you this as a small token of his gratitude for the kindness you have manifested towards it ; and he hopes that , should you be questioned upon the subject , you will not reveal the fact that you ever had the slightest communication from its father . ' Go — and return quickly . "
463459	463480	463482	463482	Greenwood	903	" You can inform Miss Monroe of the step which I have thus taken to ensure the surgeon 's secrecy , "
463489	463500	463502	463503	the servant	2459	" I shall not fail to do so , sir , "
463526	463534	463516	463516	Greenwood	903	" My child beneath Richard 's roof ! "
463683	463686	463687	463687	he	28357	" Diana , "
463690	463716	463687	463687	he	28357	" we must separate . You have conducted yourself in a manner that has made me the laughing - stock of all who know me . "
463717	463721	463723	463723	Diana	1273	" My lord ! "
463731	463744	463723	463723	Diana	1273	" you must have been misinformed ; or you are bantering me . "
463745	463753	463755	463756	the earl	4112	" Neither the one nor the other , "
463758	463786	463755	463756	the earl	4112	" You may probably conceive whether I am inclined to jest , when I state that your kind consideration towards Sir Rupert Harborough has reached my ears . "
463787	463793	463795	463795	Diana	1273	" Indeed , my lord ! "
463797	463826	463795	463795	Diana	1273	" I do not attempt to deny that I forwarded , anonymously , to Sir Rupert Harborough a sum of money to extricate him from a fearful embarrassment . "
463827	463856	463858	463861	the Earl of Warrington	28357	" It would be unmanly in me to do more than remind you whence came that money which you could afford to fling away upon an unprincipled profligate , "
463863	463892	463858	463861	the Earl of Warrington	28357	" at the same time , you can not suppose that it is pleasant to my feelings to learn that the world makes itself merry at my expense . "
463893	463922	463795	463795	Diana	1273	" Your lordship is aware that I am the last person in existence to do aught to occasion you the slightest uneasiness . Perhaps I was wrong — — "
463923	463965	463795	463795	Diana	1273	" You can not , with your good sense , think otherwise . But let us not dispute upon the point : the thing is done , and can not be recalled ; but its effect is fatal to our connection . "
463966	463974	463858	463861	the Earl of Warrington	28357	" Your lordship does not mean — — "
463975	463985	463987	463988	the nobleman	3005	" I mean that we must separate , Diana , "
463992	464001	464003	464004	the Enchantress	2342	" Is my fault irreparable in your eyes ? "
464012	464028	464003	464004	the Enchantress	2342	" No man can endure ridicule — and I am particularly sensitive in that respect . "
464029	464045	464047	464047	Diana	1273	" But where did you learn that such was the result of my foolish kindness ? "
464063	464078	464080	464081	the earl	4112	" I will give you every explanation you require , as in duty bound , "
464083	464234	464080	464081	the earl	4112	" Captain Fitzhardinge , an officer in the Grenadier Guards , is an acquaintance of mine . He is a visitor at the house of Sir Rupert Harborough ; and last evening Lady Cecilia Harborough told him what she called a capital anecdote of how she had cheated her husband out of a thousand pounds . Then , it appears , they laughed heartily at this excellent joke ; and Lady Cecilia proceeded to inform him that she had discovered whence the handsome subsidy emanated . She concluded , in terms more galling than polite , by ridiculing the Earl of Warrington , who was foolish enough to supply Mrs. Arlington so munificently with money , that she was enabled to spare some for her ancient lovers . You have asked me for the plain truth , and I have told it , as Captain Fitzhardinge stated it to me . "
464235	464250	464252	464253	the Enchantress	2342	" And thus a trivial indiscretion on my part has created all this mischief , "
464255	464290	464252	464253	the Enchantress	2342	" You have acted most unwisely , Diana : I will not go so far as to say that you must have had some particular motive in forwarding that money to one who — — "
464291	464300	464302	464302	Diana	1273	" Heaven knows the purity of my motive ! "
464316	464342	464302	464302	Diana	1273	" The world will scarcely admit that purity of motive in such a case was possible . Consider the inferences that must be drawn — — "
464343	464367	464369	464370	the Enchantress	2342	" And do you , my lord , believe that any unworthy reason of that kind led me to assist Sir Rupert Harborough ? "
464372	464431	464369	464370	the Enchantress	2342	" If I may judge by your outward conduct towards me , I should give a decided negative in reply to your question . But we should no longer be happy in each other 's society , while the least ground for unpleasant suspicions existed . We will , then , separate — but separate as good friends . "
464432	464440	464442	464442	Diana	1273	" Be it so , my lord , "
464464	464480	464482	464483	the earl	4112	" The lease of this house , and every thing it contains , are yours , "
464491	464503	464482	464483	the earl	4112	" in this pocket - book there is a cheque — — "
464504	464510	464512	464512	Diana	1273	" No , my lord , "
464514	464546	464512	464512	Diana	1273	" your bounty has already done much for me — more than you seem to think I have deserved : I can not accept another favour at your lordship 's hands . "
464637	464650	464651	464651	he	4112	" You refuse to accept this token of my friendship , Diana ? "
464654	464677	464651	464651	he	4112	" I must beg most respectfully to decline it , my lord — with fervent gratitude , nevertheless , for your generosity . "
464749	464752	464753	464753	he	4112	" Diana , "
464756	464760	464753	464753	he	4112	" we — — "
464941	464974	464935	464936	The earl	4112	" Give me your hand , Diana : we will part , as I said , good friends ; and remember that I shall always be ready to serve you . Farewell ! "
464975	464981	464983	464984	Mrs. Arlington	891	" Farewell , my lord , "
465093	465109	465110	465110	she	2342	" Oh ! if I had but said one word when his hand pressed mine , "
465113	465130	465110	465110	she	2342	" I might still have retained him ! He is gone!—my best , my only friend ! "
465444	465447	465433	465433	her	1273	" Fire ! "
465885	465987	465988	465988	His	26709	" After all , it is absurd for me to take this trouble to get my new mistress secretly out of the house . Why should she not walk boldly in and out , night or day , I wonder ? ' Pon my honour , I have a great mind that she should ! But , no — whatever agreement exists between me and Lady Cecilia , a certain degree of decency must be observed before the servants , and for the sake of one 's character with the neighbours . After all , prudence is perhaps the best system . "
466073	466080	466081	466081	he	26709	" Silence , Caroline — silence , "
466084	466092	466081	466081	he	26709	" it is most likely the housemaid . "
466278	466284	466292	466293	a man	2001	" Farewell , dearest Cecilia , "
466295	466301	466292	466293	a man	2001	" Farewell , beloved Fitzhardinge , "
466342	466351	466353	466353	Fitzhardinge	1346	" When shall we meet again , dearest ? "
466362	466376	466353	466353	Fitzhardinge	1346	" To - night — at the usual hour I will admit you , "
466381	466396	466353	466353	Fitzhardinge	1346	" Sir Rupert goes to France to - night with his splendid friend Chichester . "
466397	466404	466406	466408	the Grenadier Guardsman	12898	" Thank heaven for that blessing ! "
466410	466451	466406	466408	the Grenadier Guardsman	12898	" And now , adieu , sweet Cecilia , until this evening ! But , tell me , before I depart — shall I always find you the same warm , loving , devoted , fond creature you now are ? "
466452	466459	466353	466353	Fitzhardinge	1346	" Always — always to you , "
466471	466506	466508	466509	the officer	2833	" And am I indeed the first whom you have ever really loved ? am I the only one who has ever tasted the pleasures of heaven in your arms , save your husband ? "
466528	466540	466521	466521	he	2833	" Oh ! tell me so once again — only once ! "
466541	466556	466558	466564	the fair , but guilty patrician lady	12901	" You know that you alone could have tempted me to weakness , Fitzhardinge , "
466566	466579	466558	466564	the fair , but guilty patrician lady	12901	" you alone could have induced me to forget my marriage vows ! "
466580	466591	466593	466594	the officer	2833	" Now I shall depart happy , my beloved Cecilia , "
466645	466651	466653	466653	Cecilia	1008	" What is the matter ? "
466657	466664	466666	466667	the officer	2833	" This infernal chain is fast , "
466669	466680	466666	466667	the officer	2833	" and all I can do will not move it . "
466681	466686	466688	466689	the lady	2373	" Let me try , "
466703	466710	466712	466712	Fitzhardinge	1346	" What is to be done ? "
466714	466718	466720	466720	Cecilia	1008	" God knows ! "
466722	466751	466720	466720	Cecilia	1008	" and it is growing late ! In half - an - hour it will be day - light . Besides , the servants will be about presently . "
466752	466756	466758	466759	the officer	2833	" The devil ! "
466763	466766	466768	466769	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Stay , "
466771	466797	466768	466769	Lady Cecilia	1008	" I will go to the kitchen and obtain a light . Do not move from this spot : I will not be a moment . "
467104	467107	467109	467110	the officer	2833	" Sir , "
467116	467144	467109	467110	the officer	2833	" for all our sakes avoid exposure ; but if you require any satisfaction at my hands , you know who I am and where I reside . "
467145	467148	467150	467151	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Satisfaction ! "
467191	467212	467214	467214	she	1008	" what satisfaction can Sir Rupert Harborough require , when he admits such a creature as that into his house ? "
467233	467237	467239	467241	the young woman	7947	" Creature indeed ! "
467251	467268	467239	467241	the young woman	7947	" I think I am as honest as you , my lady , at all events . "
467269	467272	467274	467274	Cecilia	1008	" Wretch ! "
467350	467358	467360	467361	Sir Rupert	887	" Come , enough of this folly , "
467365	467382	467383	467383	he	887	" we shall have the servants here in a moment . Perhaps you and this gentleman , "
467386	467407	467383	467383	he	887	" will step into that room for a moment , while I open the door for my little companion here . "
467514	467521	467522	467522	he	26709	" Well , on my honour ! "
467533	467552	467522	467522	he	26709	" this is one of the most pleasant adventures that ever I heard or read of—'pon my honour ! "
467553	467571	467573	467574	Captain Fitzhardinge	1346	" Have you requested me to wait here in order to contribute to your hilarity , sir ? "
467578	467583	467585	467586	the baronet	26709	" My dear fellow , "
467588	467614	467585	467586	the baronet	26709	" let us laugh in concert ! Oh ! I can assure you that you need fear no law - suits nor pistols from me ! "
467615	467620	467622	467623	the Guardsman	12944	" Fear , sir ! "
467625	467633	467622	467623	the Guardsman	12944	" I do not understand the word . "
467634	467652	467654	467656	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" Well — expect , then , if that will suit you better , my dear captain , "
467658	467676	467654	467656	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" You see that my wife and myself act as we please , independently of each other . "
467677	467681	467683	467683	Cecilia	1008	" Sir Rupert ! "
467727	467732	467734	467735	the baronet	26709	" My dear Cecilia , "
467737	467767	467734	467735	the baronet	26709	" is it not much better that your friend should be made acquainted with the grounds on which you have admitted him as your sworn knight and only love ? "
467768	467775	467777	467778	Captain Fitzhardinge	1346	" Cease this bantering , sir , "
467780	467800	467777	467778	Captain Fitzhardinge	1346	" Have I not already said that I am willing to give you any satisfaction which you may require ? "
467801	467813	467815	467816	the baronet	26709	" And must I again tell you , my dear fellow , "
467831	467880	467827	467827	his	26709	bitter,—"must I again tell you that I require no satisfaction — that I have none to ask , and you none to give ? But I can not allow you to consider me a grovelling coward:—I must explain to you the grounds on which my forbearance is based . "
467881	467886	467888	467889	Captain Fitzhardinge	1346	" Proceed , sir , "
467893	467906	467908	467909	Lady Cecilia	1008	" You will then allow me to retire to my own room ? "
467922	467928	467930	467931	the baronet	26709	" No , my dear , "
467941	467960	467930	467931	the baronet	26709	" you must remain to corroborate the truth of what I am about to state to this gentleman . "
467977	467985	467987	467988	the baronet	26709	" In one word , Captain Fitzhardinge , "
467990	468093	468095	468096	the baronet	26709	" there is a mutual understanding between my wife and myself , that we shall follow our own inclinations , whims , and caprices , without reference to the ties which bind us , or the vows which we pledged at church some years ago . All this may seem very strange : it is nevertheless true . Therefore , I have no more right to quarrel with Lady Cecilia on your account , than she has to abuse me on account of that young person whom you saw in the house just now . Now , then , my dear captain , "
468105	468144	468098	468098	his	26709	" you may at your ease congratulate yourself upon being the only person that Lady Cecilia has ever loved , and the only one on whom she has ever bestowed her favours with the exception of her husband . "
468145	468154	468156	468157	the officer	2833	" Then I am to understand , sir , "
468170	468186	468156	468157	the officer	2833	" that you do not consider yourself offended or aggrieved by the — the — — "
468187	468192	468194	468195	the baronet	26709	" Not a whit ! "
468197	468214	468215	468216	The captain	5310	" On the contrary — I have no doubt we shall be excellent friends in future . "
468263	468272	468273	468273	she	1008	" What means this scene , Sir Rupert , "
468276	468282	468273	468273	she	1008	" after our mutual compact ? "
468283	468287	468289	468290	the baronet	26709	" My dear , "
468294	468348	468273	468273	she	1008	" you treated my little friend in a most unpleasant manner , and I thought myself justified in retaliating to a certain extent . Besides , I was compelled to give an explanation to a man who would have otherwise looked upon me as a coward for failing to demand satisfaction of him . "
468349	468365	468367	468368	Lady Cecilia	1008	" But did you not consider that you have rendered me contemptible in his eyes ? "
468374	468378	468380	468381	the baronet	26709	" Never fear , "
468383	468444	468380	468381	the baronet	26709	" Confiding in your sweet assurances that he alone has ever possessed your love , and that he alone , save your husband , has ever been blest with the proofs of that affection , he will return ere long to your arms . Besides , am I not going to France to - night with my splendid friend Chichester ? "
468445	468468	468273	468273	she	1008	" This is cruel , Sir Rupert . If an accident made you acquainted with the conversation which passed between us — — "
468469	468474	468476	468478	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" An accident indeed ! "
468483	468526	468476	468478	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" ' Pon my honour , the entire adventure was one of the drollest that ever occurred ! But let us say no more upon the subject ! Adhere to the compact on your side , and insult not my friends — — "
468527	468535	468537	468538	Lady Cecilia	1008	" But a prostitute in my house ! "
468545	468555	468557	468558	Sir Rupert	887	" And my wife 's paramour in my house ! "
468560	468575	468577	468578	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Oh ! there is something refined in an amour with one 's equal , "
468580	468589	468577	468578	Lady Cecilia	1008	" but a wretch of that description — — "
468590	468595	468597	468598	the baronet	26709	" Enough of this ! "
468600	468616	468597	468598	the baronet	26709	" The servants are already about : let us each retire to our own rooms . "
468845	468853	468854	468854	she	1008	" The wretch — the cowardly wretch ! "
468867	469087	468854	468854	she	1008	" was he not born to be my ruin ? From the moment that I saw him first until the present hour , has he not been an evil genius in my way ? Yes — oh ! yes : he is a demon sent to torture me in this world for my faults and failings ! Seduced by him when I was very young , I might have been plunged into disgrace and infamy , had not my father purchased his consent to espouse me . Then the large sum that was paid to save my honour was squandered in the payment of his debts , or in ministering to his extravagances . Now , what is our position ? what is my position ? Shunned by my own father and mother , I am left dependent on him who knows not how to obtain enough for himself ; or else I — I , the daughter of a peer , must sell myself to some Mr. Greenwood or Captain Fitzhardinge for the means to support my rank ! Oh ! it is atrocious : I begin to loathe myself ! Would that I were the mistress of some wealthy man who would be constant and kind towards me , rather than the wife of this beggared baronet ! "
469116	469119	469120	469120	she	1008	" Absurd ! "
469130	469329	469120	469120	she	1008	" why should I shed tears upon the past which no human power can recall ? Rather let me avail myself of the present , and endeavour to provide for the future . Am I not young ? and does not my glass tell me that I am beautiful ? Even the immaculate — the taintless — the exemplary rector of Saint David 's paid me a compliment on my good looks when I met him at Lady Marlborough 's , a few days ago . Yes — and methought that if the most evangelical of evangelical clergymen of the Established Church could for a moment be moved by my smile,—if that admired preacher , who publicly avows that he refrains from marriage upon principle,—if that holy minister who is quoted as a pattern to his class , and an example for the whole world,—if he could whisper a word savouring of a compliment in my ear , and then seem ashamed of the moment of weakness into which his admiration had betrayed him;—if my charms could effect so great a miracle as this , what may they not do for me in helping me on to fortune ? "
469345	469348	469349	469349	she	12967	" Yes , "
469356	469470	469471	469471	she	12968	" I will no longer remain in the same house with my unprincipled and heartless husband : I will no longer breathe the tainted atmosphere which he inhabits . His very name is associated in my mind with forgery and felony ! I will break the shackle which yet partially binds me to him ; I will emancipate myself from the restraint and thraldom wherein I now exist . Fitzhardinge is rich and loving : perhaps he may still feel the influence of the silken chain which I threw around his heart . We will see ! If he come gladly back to my feet , my aim is won : if not — well,"—and
469474	469490	469471	469471	she	12968	complacently,—"there are others as rich , as handsome , and as easily enchained as he ! "
469504	469592	469491	469492	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Come to me , dearest Fitzhardinge , at three precisely this afternoon : I have much to say respecting the specious falsehoods which Sir Rupert uttered this morning in order to conceal the natural cowardice of his disposition . He was afraid to involve himself in a quarrel with you ; and he excused his unmanly forbearance by means of assertions that reflected upon me . Come , then , to me at three : I shall be alone , and at home only to you . "
469812	469823	469805	469805	she	1008	" that she was only at home to Captain Fitzhardinge . "
469916	469928	469930	469931	the earl	4112	" I must apologise , Lady Harborough , for this intrusion , "
469933	469969	469930	469931	the earl	4112	" but I trust to your kindness to pardon me in that respect , and to afford me a little information concerning a matter which has suddenly assumed an air of importance in my eyes . "
469970	469990	469992	469993	Lady Cecilia	1008	" No apology is necessary for the honour which your lordship confers upon me by visiting my humble abode , "
469995	470020	469992	469993	Lady Cecilia	1008	" and with regard to the subject to which your lordship alludes , I shall be happy to furnish any information in my power . "
470021	470031	470033	470034	the earl	4112	" Your ladyship 's courtesy encourages me to proceed , "
470036	470106	470033	470034	the earl	4112	" Forgive me if I must direct your attention to one of those pieces of gossip — I will not say scandal — which so often become current in the sphere in which we move . I allude to an anecdote relative to a certain mysterious remittance of a thousand pounds which was forwarded to Sir Rupert Harborough , and which your ladyship undertook to disburse for his advantage . "
470107	470121	470123	470124	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Your lordship places the matter in as delicate a light as possible , "
470148	470234	470137	470137	she	1008	" but it was only a pleasant trick which I played Sir Rupert . The truth is , Sir Rupert is not the most generous of men towards his wife ; and when I found that some honourable person was repaying him a debt contracted a long time previously , I thought that , as the amount fell so providentially into my hands , I could not do better than appropriate it to the liquidation of the arrears of pin - money due to me . "
470235	470241	470243	470244	the earl	4112	" Very just , madam , "
470273	470283	470137	470137	she	1008	" I believe that the amount was forwarded anonymously ? "
470284	470295	470297	470298	Lady Cecilia	1008	" To tell you the candid truth , my lord , "
470300	470338	470297	470298	Lady Cecilia	1008	" the whole affair was so strange and romantic , that I kept , as a great curiosity , the letter which accompanied the bank - note . If you possess any interest in the matter — — "
470339	470354	470356	470357	the earl	4112	" Your ladyship knows that I am not seeking this information without some object , "
470361	470367	470368	470368	he	4112	" Would it be indiscreet , "
470377	470387	470368	470368	he	4112	" to request a glimpse at that great curiosity ? "
470388	470395	470397	470398	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Oh ! by no means , "
470436	470449	470450	470450	she	1008	" It was not so scented with musk when I received it , "
470455	470474	470450	470450	she	1008	" but it was redolent of a far more grateful flavour — that of this world 's mammon . "
470475	470490	470492	470495	the Earl of Warrington	28357	" I believe mammon is the deity whom we all more or less adore , "
470535	470544	470532	470532	he	28357	" May I be permitted to read it ? "
470545	470571	470573	470574	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Oh ! certainly , my lord : and , if you have any curiosity in the matter , you are welcome to retain it , "
470576	470585	470587	470588	the earl	4112	" With your leave I will do so , "
470590	470604	470606	470607	Lady Cecilia	1008	" And now that I have replied to all your lordship 's queries , "
470609	470618	470606	470607	Lady Cecilia	1008	" may I ask one in my turn ? "
470626	470648	470650	470651	the baronet	26709	" Who was the indiscreet eave's - dropper or tale - bearer that gave your lordship the hint concerning this business ? "
470655	470670	470672	470673	the earl	4112	" Methinks that your ladyship has been at no pains to conceal the affair , "
470675	470694	470672	470673	the earl	4112	" and what hundreds have talked about can not well be charged against an individual tale - bearer . "
470695	470709	470711	470711	Cecilia	1008	" Nay , my lord , I mentioned it but to two persons , "
470713	470741	470711	470711	Cecilia	1008	" the first was to Sir Rupert Harborough — in a moment of pique ; and the other was to a — a — particular friend — — "
470742	470753	470755	470756	the earl	4112	" I am not indiscreet enough to ask for names , "
470843	470846	470848	470849	the lady	2373	" Fitzhardinge , "
470851	470865	470848	470849	the lady	2373	" I perceive that you have allowed yourself to be prejudiced against me . "
470866	470873	470875	470876	the guardsman	12944	" Not prejudiced , Lady Cecilia , "
470878	471134	470875	470876	the guardsman	12944	" but I confess that I am no longer under the influence of a blind passion . The conduct of your husband this morning was that of a man who was acting consistently with the circumstances which he explained , and not that of an individual who was playing a part in order to disguise the innate cowardice of his disposition . No , Cecilia — your husband is not a coward — whatever else he may be ! And now one word relative to myself . So long as I believed that you made to me , as a proof of love , the generous sacrifice of conjugal fidelity,—so long as I believed that an affection for me alone induced you to violate your marriage - vow,—then the dream was sweet , though not the less criminal ! But when I discovered that you made no sacrifice to me,—that you came not to my arms warm with a love that trembled at detection , but secure in the existence of a heartless compact with your husband,—then my eyes were opened , and I saw that Lady Cecilia Harborough had risked nothing of all that she had pretended to risk — sacrificed nothing of all that she had affected to sacrifice — for the sake of Captain Fitzhardinge ! Thus the delusion was destroyed ; and although our amour might be based upon more impunity than I had ever conceived , it would be the less sweet ! The charm — the spell is broken ! "
471135	471154	471156	471157	Lady Cecilia	1008	" And have you come here to tell me all this — to insult me with your moralisings ? "
471182	471192	471194	471195	the officer	2833	" No ! not to insult you , Cecilia , "
471197	471229	471194	471195	the officer	2833	" but to explain in an open and candid manner the motive which leads me to say : ' Let us forget the past , as it regards each other ! ' "
471230	471235	471237	471238	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Be it so , "
471258	471276	471277	471278	Captain Fitzhardinge	1346	" In that case , sir , we can have nothing more to say to each other . "
471294	471304	471284	471285	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Beaten — beaten ! defeated in this hope ! "
471320	471369	471317	471317	she	1008	" How foolish is this grief ! how useless this indignation ! Sorrow and hatred are the consuming enemies of female beauty ! Did I not say ere now that there were others in the world as rich , as handsome , and as confiding as Captain Fitzhardinge ? "
471668	471671	471672	471672	she	1008	" Yes , "
471678	471709	471672	471672	she	1008	" he once said , ' I never saw you look so well as you appear this evening:'—these words shall be a motto to a new chapter in my life ! "
471723	471731	471732	471732	she	1008	" Thirty - six years of age , "
471736	471743	471732	471732	she	1008	musings,—"wealthy — handsome — unmarried , from principle,"—and
471757	471847	471848	471848	She	1008	lips,—"and yet fond of society , the Reverend Reginald Tracy must no longer be permitted to remain proof against woman 's beauty — aye , and woman 's wiles . Oh ! no — he shall repeat to me , but far more tenderly , the words he uttered the other evening : his passing compliment shall become a permanent expression of his sentiments ! But his character — his disposition ? must I not study them ? If that be necessary , the task is ready to hand ! "
471965	471974	471976	471977	the servant	2459	" What name shall I say , sir ? "
471988	471997	471999	472000	the nobleman	3005	" It is needless to mention any name , "
472002	472012	471999	472000	the nobleman	3005	" I shall not detain the gentleman five minutes . "
472042	472048	472050	472051	the earl	4112	" I believe , sir , "
472053	472070	472050	472051	the earl	4112	" that you are attending upon the lady who experienced so severe an accident last night ? "
472071	472086	472030	472031	The waiter	2624	" I was by chance passing through Dover Street when the flames burst forth , "
472091	472127	472030	472031	The waiter	2624	" and I gave an immediate alarm to the police . I remained upon the spot to ascertain if my professional services could be rendered available ; and it was well that I did so . "
472128	472136	472138	472139	the earl	4112	" The lady then is much injured ? "
472148	472152	472154	472155	the surgeon	29781	" Seriously injured , "
472157	472196	472154	472155	the surgeon	29781	" and as I live at some distance from this neighbourhood , I considered it proper to remain with the patient all night . Indeed , I have not left her for a moment since the accident occurred . "
472197	472207	472209	472210	the earl	4112	" Your attention shall be nobly recompensed , sir , "
472212	472224	472209	472210	the earl	4112	" Here is my card , and I am your debtor . "
472245	472249	472251	472252	the nobleman	3005	" And now , "
472254	472276	472251	472252	the nobleman	3005	" answer me one question — candidly and sincerely . Will your patient be scarred by the effects of the fire ? "
472277	472290	472292	472293	the surgeon	29781	" My lord , that is more than I can answer for , "
472295	472317	472292	472293	the surgeon	29781	" Fortunately , medical assistance was rendered the moment after the accident occurred ; and this circumstance should inspire great hope ! "
472318	472324	472326	472327	the earl	4112	" Then I will hope , "
472329	472361	472326	472327	the earl	4112	" How long an interval do you imagine must elapse ere she may be pronounced convalescent ? Or rather , I should have asked , is she in any positive danger ? "
472362	472410	472251	472252	the nobleman	3005	" There is always danger — great danger in these cases , my lord . But , should the fever subside in a few days , I should recommend the removal of the patient to some quiet neighbourhood — afar from the bustle of the West End . "
472411	472423	472425	472426	the earl	4112	" You said that you yourself resided some distance from hence ? "
472435	472446	472448	472449	the surgeon	29781	" My abode is in Lower Holloway , my lord , "
472451	472458	472448	472449	the surgeon	29781	" and my name is Wentworth . "
472459	472466	472468	472469	the earl	4112	" Holloway is quiet and retired , "
472471	472484	472448	472449	the surgeon	29781	" but is not the air too bleak there at this season ? "
472485	472514	472251	472252	the nobleman	3005	" It is pure and wholesome , my lord ; and the spot is tranquil , and devoid of the bustle of crowds and the din of carriages . "
472515	472525	472527	472528	the Earl	4112	" Wherever Mrs. Arlington may remain until her recovery , "
472530	472562	472527	472528	the Earl	4112	" she must receive all the attentions which can be lavished upon her ; and in nothing must she be thwarted where gold can procure her the gratification of her wishes . "
472563	472593	472251	472252	the nobleman	3005	" I would offer to place my house at the lady 's disposal , my lord — and the attention of Mrs. Wentworth would be unremitting — but — — "
472594	472599	472601	472602	the earl	4112	" Name the obstacle , "
472604	472636	472601	472602	the earl	4112	" Perhaps you consider that the position of the lady with regard to myself,—a position the nature of which you may have divined,—is somewhat too equivocal to permit your wife — — "
472637	472666	472251	472252	the nobleman	3005	" No , my lord ; medical men have no scruples of that kind . I hesitated because I feared that my abode would be too humble — — "
472667	472676	472678	472679	the earl	4112	" Then let that obstacle vanish this moment , "
472681	472735	472737	472738	the nobleman	3005	" It is my wish that Mrs. Arlington should be removed to your house so soon as the step can be taken with safety to herself : you will then devote yourself to her cure ; and on you I place my reliance . I have been unjust to her , Mr Wentworth , "
472753	472799	472737	472738	the nobleman	3005	tone,—"I have been unjust to her — but I will make her ample reparation — that is , provided you can preserve her beauty,—for we are all mortal — and I confess to a weakness,—but no matter ! Say — you will do your best ! "
472800	472814	472816	472817	the surgeon	29781	" My lord , I am poor , and struggling with the world , "
472819	472886	472816	472817	the surgeon	29781	" and , I may say without vanity — because I possess certificates from eminent medical men under whom I have studied — that I am not ignorant of my profession . My lord , I have every inducement to devote all the knowledge I possess to the aim which you desire . My attentions shall be unwearied and unremitting ; and if I succeed — — "
472887	472946	472737	472738	the nobleman	3005	" If you succeed in restoring her to me in that perfection of beauty which invested her when I took leave of her yesterday,—without a mark , without a scar,—your fortune shall be my care , and you will have no need to entertain anxiety relative to the future , with the Earl of Warrington as your patron . "
472947	472966	472968	472969	Mr. Wentworth	1209	" At present , my lord , all I can say is — I will do my best , "
472971	472981	472983	472984	the earl	4112	" And at present I can ask no more , "
472997	473011	472994	472994	he	4112	" May I be allowed to see your patient for a few moments ? "
473016	473025	473027	473028	the nobleman	3005	" I know why you dislike this proposal , "
473030	473059	473027	473028	the nobleman	3005	" you are afraid that , when I contemplate the altered countenance of that woman who was lately so beautiful , I shall despair of her complete cure . "
473060	473069	473071	473072	Mr. Wentworth	1209	" Such is , indeed , my impression , "
473074	473103	473071	473072	Mr. Wentworth	1209	" Those symptoms and appearances which are most alarming to persons unacquainted with the medical art , are frequently the least causes of alarm to the professional man . "
473104	473117	473119	473120	the earl	4112	" Then let me speak to her , and not see her , "
473122	473136	473119	473120	the earl	4112	" I understand your lordship : in a few minutes I will return . "
473182	473189	473190	473191	Mr. Wentworth	1209	" Will your lordship follow me ? "
473287	473300	473277	473277	himself	3005	" Diana , can you forgive me for my cruelty of yesterday ? "
473301	473320	473269	473270	The nobleman	3005	" I never entertained a feeling of resentment , my lord , and therefore have nothing to forgive , "
473333	473343	473345	473346	the earl	4112	" I did you a serious wrong , Diana , "
473348	473437	473345	473346	the earl	4112	" but I am not too proud to confess my error . I trembled at the idea of ridicule : hence the hastiness of my conduct . And then , there was a suspicion in my mind — a suspicion which made me uneasy , very uneasy — but which is now dispelled . I have read your letter which accompanied the bank - note addressed to Sir Rupert Harborough ; and I am satisfied in respect to the integrity — nay , the generosity of your motives . "
473438	473461	473463	473463	Diana	889	" It was kind of you , my lord , to take the steps necessary to reinstate me in your good opinion , "
473477	473491	473493	473494	the earl	4112	" There was no kindness in the performance of an act of justice , "
473496	473591	473493	473494	the earl	4112	" When I read in this morning 's newspaper the sad account of that terrible accident of last night , my heart smote me for my conduct towards you . Then I reflected upon all the happiness which I had enjoyed in your society , and I was moved — deeply , profoundly moved ! I despatched a servant to this hotel to inquire if you were really so seriously injured as the journal represented ; and he brought me back word that your life was no longer in positive danger , but — — "
473592	473608	473610	473610	Diana	889	" But that I shall be a hideous object for the remainder of my days , "
473620	473624	473626	473627	the earl	4112	" God forbid ! "
473631	473639	473626	473627	the earl	4112	" Mr. Wentworth seems to promise — — "
473640	473674	473493	473494	the earl	4112	" Alas ! the medical art prompts its professors to console the mind in order to heal the body ; but I am not foolish enough to yield to a hope so baseless ! "
473688	473695	473697	473700	the Earl of Warrington	28357	" Diana , you must hope , "
473702	473724	473697	473700	the Earl of Warrington	28357	" you will recover — yes , you will recover ; and even if a slight trace of this accident — — "
473725	473730	473733	473733	Diana	889	" A slight trace ! "
473749	473817	473740	473740	her	889	" a slight trace , my lord ! I shall be disfigured for life : nothing can save me ! My countenance will be seared as with a red - hot - iron — my neck will be covered with deep scars — my arms , my entire body will be furrowed with crimson and purple marks ! O God ! it is hard to suffer thus ! "
473864	473900	473861	473861	she	889	" Pardon me — I am weak , I am foolish . And now proceed to tell me how you became possessed of that note which I sent with the money to Sir Rupert Harborough . "
473916	473950	473952	473953	the earl	4112	" And now that I have done an act of justice , and convinced myself of the purity of the motives which induced you to act in the manner that created my displeasure , "
473955	474038	473952	473953	the earl	4112	" let us talk of yourself . I have made arrangements with Mr. Wentworth which , I hope , will meet your approval and conduce to your benefit . When you can be removed with safety , you shall be conveyed from the bustle of an hotel in a crowded neighbourhood to the tranquil retirement of Mr. Wentworth 's abode at Holloway . I am induced to place reliance upon the skill and talent of that man — I scarcely know why . "
474039	474051	474053	474054	the patient	34137	" Oh ! yes — he is no doubt very clever , "
474056	474078	474053	474054	the patient	34137	" for his treatment of me speedily gave me relief from the acuteness of the agony which I at first experienced . "
474079	474093	474095	474096	the nobleman	3005	" Every thing shall be done to conduce to your comfort , Diana , "
474098	474134	474095	474096	the nobleman	3005	" My upholsterer shall send down to Mr. Wentworth 's house the furniture that may be required for the rooms which you are to occupy ; and my steward shall supply him with ample funds . "
474135	474144	474146	474146	Diana	889	" How kind — how good you are , "
474148	474158	474160	474161	the earl	4112	" But I shall not attempt to see you , "
474163	474180	474160	474161	the earl	4112	" until your recovery is announced to me — your complete recovery ; and then — — "
474197	474211	474212	474212	he	4112	" Farewell , Diana — my presence is not calculated to calm you , "
474215	474236	474212	474212	he	4112	" I shall now leave you — but , remember , I watch over you from a distance . Farewell ! "
474237	474245	474247	474247	Diana	889	" Farewell — till we meet again , "
474249	474319	474247	474247	Diana	889	" But — oh ! how shall I dread that day ! And — if my worst fears should be confirmed — if I really become the horrible , scarred , hideous object which I dread,—then — then we shall never meet more,—for I will fly from the world and bury myself in some deep solitude whither none who ever knew me in my bright days shall trace me ! "
474320	474340	474342	474343	the earl	4112	" You will not be forced to adopt such an alternative , Diana — believe me you will not ! "
474345	474357	474342	474343	the earl	4112	" At all events — let us hope,—let us both hope ! "
474388	474392	474393	474393	he	29781	" Mr. Wentworth , "
474401	474448	474393	474393	he	29781	" remember all that I have told you . Gold shall be placed at your disposal with no niggard hand ; spare no expense ! That lady 's complete restoration to her pristine beauty is your care : think of naught save that one grand aim ! "
474449	474453	474455	474456	the surgeon	29781	" My lord , "
474458	474476	474455	474456	the surgeon	29781	" I can only repeat the words I used just now — I will do my best ! "
474893	474908	474910	474912	the polite beadles	13110	" This way , my lord . Pray step this way , my lady , "
474919	475054	474910	474912	the polite beadles	13110	" The pew - opener is in attendance , my lord . My lady , here is the hymn - book , which your ladyship commanded me to procure for your ladyship . My lord , take care of the step . This door , ladies , if you please . Gentlemen , this way , if you would be so condescending . Yes , sir — certainly , sir — the pew - opener will find you a seat , sir — immediately , sir . Ladies , this way is less crowded . You will find the left aisle comparatively empty . My lord , straight forward , if your lordship will be so good . Ladies , the pew - opener is in attendance . This way , ladies and gentlemen ! "
475075	475535	475061	475062	the policeman	27346	" Now , then , you young woman , where the deuce are you pushing to ? Want to get a good place , eh ? What ! with sich a rag of a shawl as that there?—I'm afeard I ca n't admit you . Now , boy , stand back , or I 'll show you the reason why . I say , old woman , you ai n't wanted here ; we does n't take in vimen with red cloaks . You 'd better go to the dissenting chapel round the corner , you had : that 's good enow for you . Holloa ! what 's this mean ? a sweep in his Sunday toggery . Come , come ; that 's rayther too strong , chummy . You toddle off , now . Here , young woman , you may come in ; you may—'cos you 're very pretty : that way , my dear . Holloa ! here comes a feller without a nose . No — no — that wo n't do at no price ; my orders is partickler ; no von comes here vithout a nose . Vy , you 'd frighten all the great ladies out o ' their vits . They already complains of the riff - raff that comes to this here chapel ; so we must try and keep it se - lect — just like Gibbs 's westry . Ha ! ha ! now then , who 's that blaigaird a - talking so loud there ? It 's on'y me as can talk here at this door , 'cos I 'm official — I am . This vay , young woman : push the door , my dear . Well , if you ai n't married , I 'm sure you ought to be . Now , then , who 's that a guffawing like a rhinoceros ? I 'll clap a stopper on your mug , I will . Come , come ; you go back , old chap : no workus - livery here ; this is the wrong shop for the workus people ; this is — I can tell yer . Vell , you 're a genteel couple , I do n't think — coming to a pro - pri - ai - tory chapel vithout no gloves , and fists as black as tinkers . Stand back there , boys , and let that young gal vith the yaller ribands come up : she 's decent , she is . Yes , my dear,—you may go in , my dear . Now , then , stand back — no more comes in this mornin ' : the orgin 's begun . "
476266	476281	476248	476251	the pew - opener	37994	" If you please , ma'am , the doors will be closed almost directly . "
476282	476296	476298	476299	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Could you — could you oblige me with a glass of water ? "
476301	476312	476298	476299	Lady Cecilia	1008	" I feel as if I were about to faint . "
476313	476320	476328	476328	she	1008	" Oh ! certainly , ma'am , "
476346	476353	476355	476361	the clergyman of the pew - opener	13149	" Is the lady very unwell ? "
476373	476384	476355	476361	the clergyman of the pew - opener	13149	" She seems very languid — quite overcome , sir , "
476389	476396	476355	476361	the clergyman of the pew - opener	13149	" But this is the pew . "
476409	476413	476414	476414	he	4937	" Lady Harborough ! "
476417	476423	476436	476436	he	4937	" Is your ladyship unwell ? "
476445	476456	476458	476459	Lady Cecilia	1008	" It is nothing — the heat , I suppose , "
476470	476489	476462	476462	she	1008	" Thank you , Mr. Tracy , for your attention : I feel better — much better now . "
476490	476506	476508	476509	the clergyman	4937	" Will your ladyship step into the vestry and sit down for a few minutes ? "
476521	476536	476538	476538	Cecilia	1008	" If it would not be indiscreet , I should esteem it a favour , "
476583	476600	476602	476602	Cecilia	1008	" I am ashamed — perfectly ashamed to give you all this trouble , Mr. Tracy , "
476614	476643	476602	476602	Cecilia	1008	" but the heat of the chapel — and , to tell the truth , the emotions which your beautiful discourse aroused within me — quite overcame me . "
476644	476655	476657	476658	Reginald Tracy	1350	" The chapel was , indeed , very much crowded , "
476680	476703	476705	476705	Cecilia	1008	" Nevertheless , this little incident will not in future prevent me from becoming one of the most regular of your congregation , "
476741	476748	476750	476750	Cecilia	1008	" I feel quite recovered now , "
476757	476777	476750	476750	Cecilia	1008	" and will return home . I offer you my best thanks for this kind attention on your part . "
476778	476813	476711	476712	Mr. Tracy	1353	" Do not mention it , Lady Harborough . But I can not permit you to return alone , after this indisposition : allow me to conduct you as far as your own door ? "
476814	476827	476750	476750	Cecilia	1008	" I could not think of taking you out of your way — "
476828	476849	476851	476852	Reginald Tracy	1350	" It happens that I have a call to make in Tavistock Square , and am actually going that way , "
477402	477405	477415	477417	her own mistress	13176	" splendid friend "
477550	477558	477560	477561	Lady Cecilia	1008	" What o'clock is it , Sarah ? "
477581	477591	477686	477687	the cameriste	13184	" It must be nearly one , my lady , "
477596	477636	477686	477687	the cameriste	13184	" Then you have no time to lose , Sarah . The ringlets are quite divine ; pray take equal pains with the back - hair . Do you think that I look better in ringlets or in bands ? "
477637	477644	477686	477687	the cameriste	13184	" In ringlets , my lady . "
477645	477671	477686	477687	the cameriste	13184	" And if I had my hair in bands , and asked you the same question , you would reply , ' In bands . ' "
477672	477684	477686	477687	the cameriste	13184	" Your ladyship can not think that I am so insincere , "
477689	477700	477702	477703	the lady	2373	" Do you fancy me in this dress , Sarah ? "
477712	477721	477686	477687	the cameriste	13184	" I prefer the blue watered - silk , "
477726	477739	477686	477687	the cameriste	13184	" Then why did you not recommend it in the first instance ? "
477740	477748	477702	477703	the lady	2373	" Your ladyship never required my advice . "
477749	477756	477702	477703	the lady	2373	" True . Have you finished ? "
477757	477779	477781	477781	Sarah	1355	" No hairdresser from Bond Street , or the Burlington Arcade , could have performed his task better , my lady , "
477783	477796	477798	477798	Cecilia	1008	" Yes — it is very well — very well , indeed , "
477806	477817	477798	477798	Cecilia	1008	" I will now descend to the drawing - room . "
477885	477890	477870	477871	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Sturm 's Reflections . "
477911	477929	477931	477932	the rector	32742	" I have called to satisfy myself that your ladyship has recovered from the indisposition of yesterday , "
477934	477938	477940	477940	Cecilia	1008	" Not altogether , "
477942	477957	477940	477940	Cecilia	1008	" Indeed , after I returned home , yesterday , I experienced a relapse . "
477958	477981	477931	477932	the rector	32742	" I observed that you were not at chapel in the evening , and I feared that such might be the case . "
478019	478050	478052	478053	the lady	2373	" I can assure you that nothing save indisposition could have induced me to remain away from a place where one gathers so much matter for useful and serious meditation , "
478055	478077	478079	478079	Reginald	1350	" And yet the world generally forgets the doctrines which are enunciated from the pulpit , an hour after their delivery , "
478081	478103	478105	478105	Cecilia	1008	" Yes — when they are doled forth by ministers who have neither talent nor eloquence to make a profound impression , "
478120	478157	478105	478105	Cecilia	1008	" I believe that our churches would be much better frequented , were the clergy less dogmatic , less obscure ; and did they address themselves more to the hearts of their hearers than they do . "
478158	478180	478182	478183	the rector	32742	" I believe it is necessary to appeal to the heart , and not be satisfied with merely reaching the ears , "
478187	478230	478232	478232	Cecilia	1008	" And wherever the pastor possesses the rare talent of moving the feeling,—of exciting the mind to salutary reflection , as well as merely expounding points of doctrine,—thither will the multitude flock , high and low , rich and poor . Oh ! "
478245	478350	478232	478232	Cecilia	1008	" how grand — how noble a situation does that man occupy , who , by the magic of his voice and the power of his mind , can collect the thousands around his pulpit ! I can understand how an impression may be easily made upon the half - educated or totally ignorant classes of society : but to cast a spell upon the intelligent , the well - informed , and the erudite,—to congregate the aristocracy of the realm to listen to the words that flow from his mouth,—oh ! great , indeed , must be the influence of such a man ! "
478351	478375	478377	478377	Reginald	1350	" You consider , then , Lady Cecilia , that the upper classes need powerful inducements to attend to the truths of religion ? "
478401	478414	478416	478416	Cecilia	1008	" I consider — but , if I tell you my thoughts , "
478422	478438	478416	478416	Cecilia	1008	" I shall unavoidably pay a high compliment to you ; and that neither — — "
478439	478451	478453	478454	the clergyman	4937	" Let me hear your ladyship 's sentiments in any case , "
478479	478483	478485	478485	Cecilia	1008	" I believe , "
478487	478657	478485	478485	Cecilia	1008	" that the upper classes in this country are very irreligious . I do not say that they are infidels : no — they all cherish a profound conviction of the truths of the gospel . But their mode of life — their indolent and luxurious habits , militate against a due regard to religious ceremonials . How is it , then , that they are aroused from their apathy ? They hear of some great preacher , and curiosity in the first instance prompts them to visit the place of his ministry . They go — almost as they would repair to see a new play . But when they listen to his words — when they drink , in spite of themselves , large draughts of the fervour which animates him — when he appeals to their hearts , then they begin to perceive that there is something more in religion than an observance of a cold ceremonial ; and they go home ' to reflect ! ' "
478658	478667	478669	478670	the rector	32742	" You believe that to be the case ? "
478698	478708	478710	478711	Lady Cecilia	1008	" I feel convinced that such is the fact , "
478731	478761	478728	478728	she	1008	" Many of my friends have confessed that such has been the case in respect to their attendance at your chapel — and such was the case with myself ! "
478762	478769	478771	478772	the clergyman	4937	" With you , Lady Cecilia ? "
478787	478793	478795	478797	the artful woman	13188	" Yes , with me , "
478799	478836	478837	478837	she	1008	" For , to be candid with you , Mr. Tracy , I need consolation of some kind — and the solace of religion is the most natural and the most effective . My domestic life , "
478846	478881	478882	478882	She	1008	" is far from a happy one . Sir Rupert thinks more of his own pleasures than of his wife;—he does more than neglect me — he abandons me for weeks and weeks together . "
478929	478940	478943	478943	Cecilia	1008	" But why should I intrude my sorrows upon you ? "
478945	478990	478943	478943	Cecilia	1008	" And yet if it be not to the minister of religion to whom we poor creatures must unburden our woes , where else can we seek for consolation ? from what other source can we hope to receive lessons of resignation and patience ? "
478991	478994	478996	478997	the rector	32742	" True , "
478999	479037	478996	478997	the rector	32742	" And that has often appeared to me the best and redeeming feature in the Roman Catholic world , where the individual places reliance upon his priest , and looks to him for spiritual support and aid . "
479038	479051	479053	479054	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Ah ! would that our creed permitted us the same privilege ! "
479061	479078	479080	479080	Reginald	1350	" I know of no rule nor law which forbids the exercise of such a privilege , "
479082	479100	479080	479080	Reginald	1350	" unless , indeed , usage and custom be predominant , and will admit of no exceptions . "
479101	479213	478996	478997	the rector	32742	" For my part , I despise such customs and usages , when they tend to the exclusion of those delightful outpourings of confidence which the individual pants to breathe into the ears of the pastor in whom implicit faith can be placed . In how many cases could the good clergyman advise his parishioners , to the maintenance of their domestic comfort ? how many heart - burnings in families would not such a minister be enabled to soothe ? Oh ! sir , I feel that your eloquence could teach me how to bear , unrepiningly , and even cheerfully , all the sorrows of my own domestic hearth ! "
479214	479228	479230	479231	the clergyman	4937	" Then look upon me as a friend , my dear Lady Cecilia , "
479241	479275	479230	479231	the clergyman	4937	" look upon me as a friend ; and happy indeed shall I be if my humble agency or advice can contribute to smooth the path of life for even only one individual ! "
479276	479296	479302	479302	she	1008	" Mr. Tracy , I accept your preferred friendship — I accept it as sincerely as it is offered , "
479393	479396	479398	479398	Cecilia	1008	" Henceforth , "
479420	479463	479474	479475	the rector	32742	anticipated—"henceforth you will have no votary more constant in attendance than I ; but , on your part , you must occasionally spare from your valuable time a single half hour wherein to impart to me the consolations I so much require . "
479464	479472	479474	479475	the rector	32742	" Be not afraid , Lady Cecilia , "
479492	479529	479474	479475	the rector	32742	" I shall not forget that you have ingenuously and frankly sought my spiritual aid ; and I should be false to the holy cause in which I have embarked , were I to withhold it . "
479530	479541	479543	479543	Cecilia	1008	" I thank you — deeply , sincerely thank you , "
479545	479579	479543	479543	Cecilia	1008	" But judge for yourself whether I do not seek solace , in my domestic afflictions , from the proper source ! This is the book which I was reading when you called . "
479585	479588	479543	479543	Cecilia	1008	" Reflections , "
479596	479599	479600	479600	she	1008	" There , "
479603	479613	479600	479600	she	1008	" it was this page which I was perusing . "
479986	479994	479996	479997	Lady Cecilia	1008	" He will come again on Wednesday , "
480185	480189	480141	480141	his	1350	" pleasant vices , "
480365	480369	480361	480361	he	1350	" a bore . "
480536	480544	480547	480548	Lady Cecilia	1008	" He will come again on Wednesday , "
480674	480730	480658	480660	The designing creature	13233	" It is indeed kind of you to visit me on such a day as this . I have been so happy — so resigned — so possessed with the most complete mental tranquillity since you manifested sympathy and interest in my behalf , that your presence appears to be that of a good angel ! "
480731	480748	480750	480751	the rector	32742	" It is our duty to sustain those who droop , and console those who suffer , "
480753	480757	480759	480759	Cecilia	1008	" Delightful task ! "
480761	480837	480759	480759	Cecilia	1008	" What a pure and holy satisfaction must you enjoy , when you reflect upon the amount of comfort which your lessons impart to the world - wearied and sinking spirit . Believe me , many an one has entered the gates of your chapel with a weight upon his soul almost too heavy for him to bear , and has issued forth carrying his burden of care lightly , if not cheerfully , along ! "
480838	480858	480860	480860	Reginald	1350	" Do you really imagine that my humble agency can produce such good results in the cause of heaven ? "
480877	480884	480885	480885	she	1008	" I do — I do , "
480892	480919	480920	480920	she	1008	" I can judge by the effect which your admirable discourse of last Sunday morning produced upon myself . For — let me not deceive you , "
480935	480990	480920	480920	she	1008	voice,—"let me not deceive you — it was not the heat of the chapel which overcame me — it was your eloquence ! I dared not confess this to you at first ; but now — now that I can look upon you as a friend — I need have no secret from you . "
481109	481132	481133	481133	he	13236	" Oh ! how can the man who accompanied you to the altar , and there swore to love and cherish you , "
481148	481174	481133	481133	he	13236	before,—"how can that man find it in his heart to neglect — to abandon you,—you who are evidently all gentleness , amiability , and candour ! "
481175	481189	481191	481191	Cecilia	1008	" He has no heart — no soul for any one save himself , "
481193	481248	481133	481133	he	13236	" And now tell me — relieve my mind from a most painful suspense upon one point ! Am I criminal in the eyes of heaven , because I have ceased to love one whom I vowed to love , but whose conduct has quenched all the affection that I once experienced for him ? "
481249	481259	481261	481261	Reginald	1350	" You must not harden your heart against him , "
481263	481299	481261	481261	Reginald	1350	" but by your resignation , your uncomplaining patience , your meekness , and your constant devotion to his interests , you must seek to bring him back to the paths of duty and love . "
481300	481312	481314	481314	Cecilia	1008	" I might as well essay to teach the hyena gratitude , "
481316	481322	481333	481333	he	13238	" You speak too bitterly , "
481351	481361	481363	481363	she	1008	" Alas ! we have no power over volition , "
481365	481384	481363	481363	she	1008	" and that doctrine is a severe one which enjoins us to kiss the hand that strikes us . "
481385	481388	481390	481390	Reginald	1350	" True , "
481392	481422	481423	481423	He	1350	" I know not how it is — but I feel that I am at this moment unaccountably deficient in argument to meet your objections ; and yet — — "
481437	481455	481457	481457	Cecilia	1008	" Oh ! you can appreciate the difficulty of enjoining a love towards one who merits hatred , "
481476	481576	481457	481457	Cecilia	1008	" You see that you are deficient in reasoning to enforce the alleged necessity of maintaining , cherishing , and nourishing respect and veneration for a husband who has forfeited all claims to such feelings on the part of his injured wife . At all events , do not tell me that I am criminal in ceasing to love one who oppresses me;—do not say that I offend heaven by ceasing to kiss the hand that rudely repulses all my overtures of affection;—oh ! tell me not that — or you will make me very , very miserable indeed ! "
481610	481620	481622	481623	the clergyman	4937	" Compose yourself — compose yourself , Lady Cecilia , "
481644	481670	481622	481623	the clergyman	4937	" Do not give way to sorrow — remember the lessons of resignation and patience which you have heard from my lips — remember — — "
481703	481707	481708	481708	she	2373	" Oh Reginald!—Reginald ! "
481711	481730	481708	481708	she	2373	" I can not love my husband more — no — it is impossible ! I love another ! "
481731	481736	481738	481739	the rector	32742	" You love another ! "
481755	481776	481778	481778	Cecilia	1008	" Yes — and now reproach , revile me — leave me — spurn me — treat me with contempt ! "
481780	481802	481778	481778	Cecilia	1008	" do all this if you will ; but never , never can you prevent me from idolizing — adoring you ! "
481803	481806	481808	481809	Reginald Tracy	1350	" Cecilia ! "
481816	481825	481808	481809	Reginald Tracy	1350	" you know not what you are saying ! "
481826	481841	481843	481844	the lady	2373	" Alas ! I know but too well the feelings which my words express , "
481855	481883	481843	481844	the lady	2373	" Hear me for a few minutes , and then leave me to the misery of my fate — a hopeless love , and a breaking heart ! "
481884	481898	481900	481900	Reginald	1350	" Speak , then , and unburden your mind to me without reserve , "
481935	481952	481954	481954	Cecilia	1008	" Yes , I will speak , even though I render myself contemptible in your sight , "
481987	482326	482327	482327	Reginald	1350	" For months and months past I have cherished for you a feeling , the true nature of which has only revealed itself to me within the last few days . In the first instance , I admired your character and your talents : I respected you ; and respect and admiration soon ripened into another feeling . You do not know the heart of woman ; but it is ever moved by a contemplation of the sublime characteristics of remarkable men — like you . I met you in society , and I almost worshipped the ground on which you trod . I listened to your conversation : not a word was lost to me ! During long and sleepless nights your image was ever present to my mind . You became an idol that I adored . At length you yourself , one evening , innocently and unconsciously , fanned the flame that was engendered in my heart : you told me that I looked well . That passing compliment rendered me your devoted slave . I thought that no human happiness could be greater than that of pleasing you . I resolved to attend your chapel from that period . I obtained the pew that was nearest to the pulpit ; and when you preached I was electrified . Oh ! you saw how I was overcome ! Your attention to me on that occasion threw additional chains around me . Then you called on me the day before yesterday , and you spoke so kindly that I was every moment on the point of falling at your feet , and exclaiming,—'Forgive me , but I now know that I love you ! ' You proffered me your friendship : how joyously I accepted the sacred gift ! And that friendship — oh ! let me not forfeit it now — for the love which my heart cherishes for you shall be as pure and taintless as that friendship with which you have blessed me ! "
482509	482518	482519	482519	she	1008	" You hate me — you despise me , "
482530	482575	482576	482576	She	1008	" Oh ! do not crush me with your contempt — do not abandon me to the conviction of your abhorrence ! Reginald — take pity upon me : forgive me for loving you — forgive me — on my knees I implore you ! "
482599	482602	482604	482605	the rector	32742	" Cecilia , "
482616	482628	482629	482629	she	1008	" No — no , you shall not leave me thus , "
482636	482662	482629	482629	she	1008	" I should die if you went away , without telling me that you forgive me ! No , you must not leave me thus ! "
482663	482678	482680	482680	Reginald	1350	" Rise , Cecilia — rise — in the name of heaven , rise ! "
482693	482720	482629	482629	she	1008	" rise , and I will forgive you . I will do all that you desire — I will not leave you until you are composed . "
482721	482738	482740	482740	Cecilia	1008	" And you will return and see me again ? you will not withdraw your friendship ? "
482749	482756	482758	482758	Reginald	1350	" No — never , never ! "
482780	482792	482794	482794	Cecilia	1008	" Oh ! thank you — thank you for that assurance ! "
482815	482836	482808	482808	she	1008	" you shall be as a brother to me ; and our friendship , our love , shall be eternal ! "
482919	482937	482958	482958	him	1350	" To - morrow , to - morrow , dearest Cecilia , I will see thee again , "
482943	482948	482950	482951	the lady	2373	" He is mine ! "
482960	482964	482950	482951	the lady	2373	" irrevocably mine ! "
483687	483698	483699	483699	he	1350	" My God ! what is the matter with me ? "
483729	483790	483791	483791	He	1350	" I have tried to pray — and last night , for the first time in my life , I sought my pillow , unable to implore the blessings of my Maker . Oh ! what spell has overtaken me ? what influence is upon me ? Cecilia — Cecilia — is it indeed thou that hast thus changed me ? "
483831	483834	483835	483835	he	1350	" No , "
483840	483938	483835	483835	he	1350	" I will never see her more . I will conquer these horrible feelings — I will triumph over the mad desires , the fiery cravings which have converted the heaven of my heart into a raging hell ! Oh ! why is she so beautiful ? why did she say that she loved me ? Was it to disturb me in my peaceful career — to wean me from my God ? No — no : she yielded to an impulse which she could not control;—she loves me — she loves me — she loves me ! "
483982	483989	483990	483990	he	13274	" Yes — she loves me , "
483993	484061	483990	483990	he	13274	" but I must fly from her — I must avoid her as if she were a venomous serpent . I dare not trust myself again in her presence : and not for worlds — not for worlds would I be with her alone once more . No,—I must forget her — I must tear her image from my heart — I must trample it under foot ! "
484186	484194	484195	484195	he	13274	" I will see her once more , "
484206	484240	484195	484195	he	13274	" I will tell her that I stand upon an abyss — I will implore her to have mercy upon me , and permit me to retreat ere yet it be too late ! "
484273	484280	484281	484281	he	13274	" Even now I might retreat , "
484286	484298	484281	484281	he	13274	" there is still time ! I will — I will ! "
484559	484566	484568	484568	Cecilia	1008	" Your visit to - day , "
484570	484593	484568	484568	Cecilia	1008	" proves to me that you have forgiven the indiscreet confession into which I was yesterday led in a moment of weakness . "
484594	484609	484611	484611	Reginald	1350	" I am come as a friend — as a true and sincere friend , "
484621	484649	484611	484611	Reginald	1350	" But I know not whether my occupations , my duties , in a word — will permit me to visit you again for some time — — "
484650	484668	484670	484670	Cecilia	1008	" Oh ! do not deprive me of the pleasure of your society from time to time , "
484713	484719	484721	484721	Reginald	1350	" Listen , Lady Cecilia , "
484723	484752	484721	484721	Reginald	1350	" and I will tell you frankly the real motives which most compel me to forego the pleasure of your society in future . I tremble for myself ! "
484753	484759	484761	484761	Cecilia	1008	" You tremble for yourself ! "
484769	484781	484761	484761	Cecilia	1008	" Do you think me , then , so very formidable ? "
484782	484789	484791	484791	Reginald	1350	" Formidable — oh ! no , "
484802	484824	484791	484791	Reginald	1350	" But I consider that you are very beautiful — too beautiful for me thus to seek your presence with impunity . "
484825	484844	484846	484847	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Then would you sever that bond of friendship which you yourself proposed so generously , so kindly ? "
484874	484893	484895	484895	Reginald	1350	" It must be so — it must be so — for my peace of mind , Cecilia ! "
484925	484934	484936	484936	Cecilia	1008	" It must be so,—oh ! cruel resolve ! "
484946	485010	484936	484936	Cecilia	1008	" But let me not advance my selfish feelings as a barrier to your interest . Oh ! no , Reginald — I would sacrifice every thing to give you pleasure ! You shall go — you shall leave me ; but you will sometimes think of me — you will occasionally devote a thought to her who has dared to love you ! "
485011	485017	484939	484939	his	1350	" Dared to love me ! "
485020	485033	484936	484936	Cecilia	1008	rector;—"and what if I — — but no — it is madness ! "
485034	485046	485048	485048	Cecilia	1008	" Speak — tell me what you were about to say , "
485055	485089	485048	485048	Cecilia	1008	" I was on the point of asking what you would think — what opinion you would form of me , if I were to confess that I also dared to love you ? "
485090	485103	485105	485105	Cecilia	1008	" I should reply that such happiness never could descend upon me , "
485107	485126	485128	485128	Reginald	1350	" And yet it is true — it is true ! I can not conceal it from myself , "
485139	485148	485128	485128	Reginald	1350	" it is true that I love you ! "
485149	485158	485160	485160	Cecilia	1008	" Oh ! am I indeed so blest ? "
485162	485172	485160	485160	Cecilia	1008	" Tell me once more that you love me ! "
485173	485177	485179	485180	the rector	32742	" Love you ! "
485191	485205	485206	485206	He	32742	" I worship — I adore you — I will die for you ! "
486134	486144	486145	486145	he	1350	" Oh ! I am not yet totally lost ! "
486154	486357	486145	486145	he	1350	" I am not yet an outcast from divine mercy ! Heaven itself manifests an interest in my welfare : dare I neglect the warning ? No — no ! I have sinned — but there is repentance . Upon my otherwise spotless life there is one stain ; but tears of regret shall be shed unceasingly until the mark be washed away ! And thou , temptress — never more must we meet as we have lately met ; I must shun thee as my evil genius ! Yet I do not blame thee — for I myself was fond , and being fond , was weak . If I fell , and can yet aspire to pardon and forgiveness,—I who was strong,—what extenuation may not exist for thee — a poor , weak woman ! Oh ! let the light of divine grace shine in upon my soul , even as these bright beams of the orb of day penetrate with cheering influence to my very heart ! Let me rise up from the depths of sin , stronger than when I fell,—so that sad experience may tend to confirm my resolves to pursue the paths of chastity and virtue ! "
486566	486572	486551	486551	he	1350	" lead him into temptation . "
486783	486791	486793	486793	Markham	874	" The desire of my dying friend , "
486795	486841	486793	486793	Markham	874	" must serve as an apology for my intrusion upon you ; but , I implore you , reverend sir , not to hesitate to soothe by your much - coveted presence the passage of a fellow - creature from this world to a better . "
487099	487104	487106	487106	Ellen	1117	" Oh ! sir , "
487121	487140	487106	487106	Ellen	1117	" how grateful am I for this prompt attention to the wish of my dear — dear father ! "
487141	487154	487160	487160	he	32742	" I deserve no gratitude for the performance of a Christian duty , "
487229	487234	487236	487236	Monroe	1117	" This holy man , "
487238	487262	487236	487236	Monroe	1117	" has taught me how to die like a true Christian . Weep not , dearest Ellen ; we shall meet again hereafter . "
487263	487270	487272	487274	the young lady	4262	" Oh , my dearest father , "
487283	487298	487272	487274	the young lady	4262	" it is I — I who have murdered you ! My conduct — — "
487299	487312	487314	487315	her father	5334	" Silence , Ellen — accuse not yourself in that dreadful manner , "
487392	487403	487405	487406	the surgeon	29781	" Mr. Monroe must be kept very — very quiet , "
487421	487429	487431	487431	Ellen	1117	" And then — there is hope ? "
487436	487443	487445	487446	the surgeon	29781	" Yes — there is hope , "
487449	487461	487463	487463	Ellen	1117	" May heaven be thanked for that assurance on your part , "
487555	487565	487567	487567	Reginald	1350	" I will call again to - morrow morning , "
487573	487585	487567	487567	Reginald	1350	" for I perceive that this gentleman is not without hopes . "
487586	487599	487601	487601	Ellen	1117	" Thank you — thank you , sir , for your kindness , "
487606	487621	487622	487622	She	1117	" Your presence seems to have brought a blessing into this sick - room . "
487956	487970	487953	487953	she	1117	" He will recover ! Mr. Wentworth assures me that he will recover ! "
487971	487983	487985	487985	Reginald	1350	" Most sincerely do I congratulate you upon this happy change , "
487987	488012	487985	487985	Reginald	1350	" I can well comprehend the feelings of an affectionate daughter who is allowed to hope that her parent may be restored to her . "
488013	488026	488028	488028	Ellen	1117	" Yes , sir — and so good a father as mine ! "
488030	488039	488028	488028	Ellen	1117	" But it was all my fault — — "
488056	488063	488065	488066	the rector	32742	" Your fault , Miss Monroe ? "
488093	488115	488065	488066	the rector	32742	" I can not believe that any fault of yours — you whom I found hanging over your beloved father — — "
488116	488126	488128	488128	Ellen	1117	" Let us speak no more upon that subject , "
488153	488191	488192	488192	Her	1117	" He will recover — something tells me that he will recover ; and then — oh ! how I will cherish him — how I will exert myself to make the remainder of his days happy ! "
488726	488780	488712	488714	The old woman	26813	" A man of great learning like you , reverend sir , can not be otherwise than a man of great taste . This conviction has emboldened me to call upon you in preference to any other , relative to a most perfect work of art which fortune has thrown in my way . "
488815	488827	488829	488830	the hag	29746	" Listen to me for a few minutes , reverend sir , "
488832	488858	488829	488830	the hag	29746	" and I will explain my meaning to you . Your charity , as well as your taste , is about to be appealed to . "
488859	488862	488864	488865	the clergyman	4937	" Speak , "
488898	488913	488915	488917	the old hag	29758	" I will not detain you long — I will not detain you long , "
488919	489085	488915	488917	the old hag	29758	" You must know , reverend sir , that a foreign sculptor — a poor Italian — came some few months ago to lodge at my humble dwelling . He was in the deepest distress , and had not the means to procure either marble or tools . I am very poor — very poor , myself , sir ; but I could not see a fellow - creature starving . I bought him marble — and I bought him tools . He went to work , toiling day and night almost unweariedly ; and a week ago he put the finishing stroke to the statue of a nymph . His art has enabled him , by means of colour , to give a life - like appearance to that admirable work of art ; so that as you contemplate it , it seems to you as if the eyes were animated , the lips breathed , and the bosom rose and sank with respiration . "
489086	489102	489104	489105	the rector	32742	" And your artist is , no doubt , anxious to dispose of his statue ? "
489107	489111	489113	489114	the hag	29746	" Precisely so , "
489116	489162	489113	489114	the hag	29746	" I do not profess to be a judge myself ; but I can speak of the effect which it produced upon me . When I saw it finished — standing upon its pedestal — I was about to address it as a living being . "
489163	489174	489176	489176	Reginald	1350	" The effect must , then , be indeed striking , "
489193	489204	489206	489208	the old hag	29758	" Were you to judge for yourself , reverend sir , "
489210	489258	489206	489208	the old hag	29758	" you would find that I have not overrated the perfection of this masterpiece . The sculptor demands but a small price for his statue : it would be a charity were you to purchase it yourself , or recommend one of your friends to do so . "
489259	489272	489274	489274	Reginald	1350	" When and where could I see this matchless work of art ? "
489283	489297	489299	489302	the horrible old hag	13394	" At my own humble dwelling in Golden Lane is this statue concealed , "
489304	489338	489299	489302	the horrible old hag	13394	" and no mortal eyes , save the sculptor 's and mine own , have yet glanced upon it . If you will accompany me now , you can inspect it without delay . "
489405	489417	489419	489420	the rector	32742	" I will proceed with you at once to your abode , "
489429	489436	489438	489439	the hag	29746	" And you will do well , "
489441	489458	489438	489439	the hag	29746	" for I can promise you a fine treat in what you are about to see . "
489621	489632	489634	489636	the old woman	26813	" This is a strange place , you will say , "
489651	489662	489639	489639	she	26813	court,—"this is a strange place to contain such a treasure . "
489663	489679	489681	489682	the clergyman	4937	" And for that reason the treasure should not long be allowed to remain here , "
489923	489936	489942	489942	she	29746	" I gave the poor artist the best rooms in my house , "
489953	489973	489974	489974	She	29746	" The statue stands in the adjoining chamber ; you can inspect it at once , while I — — "
490277	490284	490285	490285	he	1350	" I am not then deceived ! "
490484	490490	490491	490491	he	1350	" O Cecilia , Cecilia ! "
490495	490637	490491	490491	he	1350	" hast thou sent thy statue hither to compel me to fall at its feet and worship the senseless stone , while thou — the sweet original — art elsewhere , speculating perhaps upon the emotions which this phantasmagorian sport was calculated to conjure up within me ! Ah ! Cecilia , if thou wast resolved to subdue me once more — if thou couldst not rest until I became thy slave again,—oh ! why not have invited me to meet thine own sweet self , instead of this speechless , motionless , passionless image,—a counterpart of thee only in external loveliness ! Yes — there it is perfect:—the hair — the brow — the eyes — the mouth — — Heavens ! those lips seem to smile once more ; those eyes sparkle with real fire ! Cecilia — Cecilia — "
490661	490666	490667	490667	he	1350	" Yes — yes ! "
490698	490700	490701	490701	he	1350	altogether,—"yes ! "
490704	490739	490701	490701	he	1350	" there is something more than mere senseless marble here ! The eyes shoot fire — the lips smile — the bosom heaves — — Oh ! Cecilia — Cecilia , it is yourself ! "
490783	490804	490806	490806	Cecilia	1008	" And you will pardon me for the little stratagem which I adopted to bring you back to my arms ? "
490808	490818	490820	490821	the rector	32742	" How can I do otherwise than pardon you ? "
490860	490949	490806	490806	Cecilia	1008	" Oh ! Cecilia , I have had a violent struggle with my feelings ; but I shall now contend against them no more . No ! from this instant I abandon all hope of empire — all wish for dominion over myself : I yield myself up to the pleasures of love and to thee ! Sweet Cecilia , thou hast taught me how ineffable is the bliss which mortals may taste in this world;—and after all , the sure present is preferable to the uncertain future ! "
490950	490973	490975	490976	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Reginald — beloved Reginald , didst thou imagine that I would resign thee so easily as thou wouldst have resigned me ! "
490978	491009	490975	490976	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Oh ! you know not the heart of woman ! There were but two alternatives for me — to bring you back , or to avenge myself on you . "
491010	491014	491016	491016	Reginald	1350	" Avenge yourself ! "
491020	491023	490806	490806	Cecilia	1008	" Yes , "
491042	491199	490806	490806	Cecilia	1008	" a woman who fondly — madly loves , as I love , Reginald — will not so willingly part with the object of her affection ! What,—could you suppose that I would surrender myself to you one day to be abandoned the next ? No — never , never would I permit myself to be made the victim of a caprice ! You wrote to me to implore me not to seek to see you again : I requested one last interview — you refused me my demand ! Then I smarted sorely ; but I said to myself , ' He loves me ' ; and I added , ' I love him also . ' I accordingly resolved to attempt one grand effort to draw the anchorite from his cell . Chance threw in my way the old woman whom I sent to you , and in whose house we now are — — "
491200	491207	491209	491209	Reginald	1350	" And what chance was that ? "
491224	491234	491236	491236	Cecilia	1008	" I will tell you all , dearest Reginald , "
491238	491277	491236	491236	Cecilia	1008	" The evening after I received your cruel note desiring that all might end between us , I was going out with the intention of calling upon you — yes , of throwing myself at your feet — — "
491278	491282	491284	491285	the rector	32742	" Imprudent Cecilia ! "
491294	491311	491313	491313	Cecilia	1008	" Yes — I was on the point of leaving my own abode to seek yours , "
491315	491367	491313	491313	Cecilia	1008	" when I heard a hoarse and ominous voice muttering behind me . I looked round , and perceived that old wretch . She smiled — or rather , leered significantly , and said , ' Happy , happy lady — to enjoy the rector of Saint David 's love ! ' "
491368	491373	491375	491375	Reginald	1350	" She said that ! "
491377	491387	491375	491375	Reginald	1350	" How could she divine what passed between us ? "
491388	491414	491313	491313	Cecilia	1008	" She has since explained to me how she one evening saw you leave my house — with a certain wildness in your manner — — "
491415	491420	491422	491423	the rector	32742	" True ! true ! "
491425	491448	491422	491423	the rector	32742	" and the mind of the old woman being perhaps naturally evil , she conceived evil of others on the faintest suspicion . "
491449	491452	491454	491454	Cecilia	1008	" Exactly , "
491456	491482	491454	491454	Cecilia	1008	" When she accosted me in that manner , I was so wretched , so miserable at the idea of being separated from you — — "
491483	491500	491313	491313	Cecilia	1008	" Sweetest creature ! I was , indeed , ungrateful in return for so much love ! "
491501	491548	491454	491454	Cecilia	1008	" I was so unhappy that I was even glad to speak of thee to such a wretch as that old creature . Then she uttered words of consolation , and we talked together — talked for an hour in the cold , damp street — — "
491549	491553	491555	491555	Reginald	1350	" Poor Cecilia ! "
491557	491566	491568	491570	the wily woman	13446	" What would I not dare for you ? "
491580	491610	491568	491570	the wily woman	13446	" And now you can guess the rest — how the old woman proposed that some stratagem should be invented to bring the recreant back to my arms — — "
491611	491642	491644	491644	Reginald	1350	" And you have thus blindly confided yourself — not only your secret , but mine also — to a perfect stranger ? O , Cecilia — was this prudent ? "
491648	491654	491656	491657	the lady	2373	" Does love know prudence ? "
491659	491710	491656	491657	the lady	2373	" But fear not : gold will seal the lips of our confidant ; and better is it for her obscure dwelling to be the scene of our loves than for our caresses to be exchanged at my abode , where the intrusion of a servant at any moment — — "
491711	491714	491716	491716	Reginald	1350	" True ! "
491718	491734	491716	491716	Reginald	1350	" And yet upon what a fearful abyss does my reputation now seem to tremble ! "
491735	491738	491740	491741	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Yours ! "
491762	491858	491745	491745	she	1008	" Oh ! can you be so selfish as to think only of yourself ? Should you be detected , you are ruined only in your profession , and not as a man — for with the man there is no dishonour in illicit love;—but if I be detected , am I not lost as a wife , and as a woman ? Will not all the wrath of an avenging society light upon me ? For it is upon us — upon poor woman — that contumely , and shame , and disgrace fall ! "
491859	491866	491868	491869	the rector	32742	" Forgive me , dearest Cecilia , "
491879	491955	491868	491869	the rector	32742	" I have been unjust to you — I have thought only of myself , unmindful of the immense sacrifice that is made by thee ! But , forgive me , I say — and never again shall the expression of my cowardly alarms — my egotistical terrors impair our happiness ! I love you — I love you , my Cecilia : Oh ! heaven knows how sincerely — how madly I love you ! "
491956	491964	491966	491966	Cecilia	1008	" And you will love me always ? "
491968	491977	491979	491980	the rector	32742	" Always ! for ever — and ever ! "
493259	493334	493243	493255	the fair - complexioned man , whose name we have not yet stated	13507	" Do n't alarm yourself , my dear young woman : we have banked the rag for fear that a buzman[87 ] should have nabbed you with it in your possession . But you shall have your reg'lars out of it , mind , whenever you want to pursue your way . Only , as you 've happened to trespass upon the dominions of his high mightiness King Zingary , you must pay toll . "
493410	493419	493393	493393	she	1292	" Have not you and I met before ? "
493420	493427	493393	493393	she	1292	" Not unlikely , my dear , "
493432	493469	493393	493393	she	1292	" Perhaps under the screw — or in the Holy Land , which I visit from time to time — or else in the bottom of a coal - hell[90 ] in the county of Stafford . "
493470	493477	493479	493480	the Rattlesnake	1292	" It is ! it is ! "
493496	493504	493490	493490	her	1292	" Do n't you remember me now ? "
493505	493509	493511	493512	the man	2092	" Remember you ? "
493548	493568	493537	493537	he	2292	" May I never drink rum slim[91 ] again if it is n't my old flame , Meg Flathers ! "
493578	493582	493584	493584	Skilligalee,—for	1366	" Your Majesty , "
493595	493598	493599	493599	he	1366	suppressed,—"Your Majesty , "
493608	493625	493599	493599	he	1366	" allow me to present to you my wife , the lovely and accomplished Margaret Flathers . "
493626	493631	493633	493633	Zingary	953	" She is welcome , "
493636	493685	493633	493633	Zingary	953	" Young woman , sit down and be welcome . We ask no questions whether you are our comrade 's splice[92 ] or not : it is enough for us that he acknowledges you as such . Aischa — welcome a daughter ; Eva — greet a sister . "
493703	493710	493712	493712	Aischa	1363	" I welcome you , daughter , "
493714	493721	493723	493723	Eva	1365	" I greet you , sister , "
493741	493751	493753	493753	Morcar	1364	" And I greet you too , my gal , "
493772	493778	493780	493781	the King	3366	" And now sit down , "
493783	493789	493780	493781	the King	3366	" and moisten your chaffer . "[93
493791	493796	493798	493798	Morcar	1364	" Ah ! do , "
493800	493826	493798	493798	Morcar	1364	" for you must want it after sleeping underneath that tree on the top of the hill , exposed to the cold wind and damp . "
493967	493973	493976	493976	Aischa	1363	" No — there first , "
493995	494001	494003	494003	Skilligalee	1337	" Good — isn't it ? "
494010	494022	494024	494025	the Rattlesnake	1292	" I felt very cold — and it has revived me , "
494027	494040	494042	494042	Skilligalee	1337	" And the contents of that pot will put you right altogether , "
494055	494061	494062	494062	he	1364	" Beg pardon , majesty , "
494131	494141	494117	494129	the Traveller , who had sat a silent spectator of all that passed	13528	" Now , friend , your turn is come . "
494142	494146	494148	494149	the man	2092	" Thank you , "
494168	494183	494160	494160	he	2092	" And some one else 's turn must come too , sooner or later . "
494184	494192	494194	494200	the laughing , light - hearted Skilligalee	13530	" Always brooding upon the same thing , "
494202	494216	494218	494219	the Traveller	7829	" And if you had been served by a villain as I was , "
494223	494258	494218	494219	the Traveller	7829	" you would long for the time to come to settle up accounts with him . Thank my stars ! we shall be in London to - morrow , and then — then — — "
494333	494340	494341	494341	she	13533	" Are you going to London ? "
494363	494373	494341	494341	she	13533	" Ah ! indeed are we , my dear , "
494378	494420	494341	494341	she	13533	" The royal palace in the Holy Land is prepared for our reception ; and this night at nine o'clock does his majesty make his triumphant entry , disguised as a timber - merchant,[94 ] into that part of his dominions . "
494421	494425	494427	494428	the Rattlesnake	1292	" To London ! "
494430	494444	494427	494428	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Then — then — I can not accompany you — I — — "
494445	494452	494454	494454	Skilligalee	1337	" What have you to fear ? "
494456	494476	494454	494454	Skilligalee	1337	" Have you not me to defend you individually , and his majesty 's protection to shield you generally ? "
494477	494482	494427	494428	the Rattlesnake	1292	" No — no , "
494487	494527	494484	494485	Margaret Flathers	1291	" I cannot — will not return to London . I hate the place — I detest it — I abhor it ! I am not even now as far from it as I could wish — not half . "
494528	494533	494535	494535	Skilligalee	1337	" Far from it ? "
494542	494563	494484	494485	Margaret Flathers	1291	" Why , you can almost hear the sounds of the cabs and hackney - coaches where we are now . "
494564	494567	494569	494569	Margaret	1291	" What ! "
494571	494584	494569	494569	Margaret	1291	" How far are we from London ? tell me — speak ! "
494585	494604	494606	494606	Skilligalee	1337	" When you are on the top of that place where I found you sleeping early this morning , "
494608	494624	494606	494606	Skilligalee	1337	" you can see Hornsey Wood on the next hill — about two miles off . "
494625	494647	494649	494649	Margaret	1291	" My God ! then in spite of all my care last night , I must have gone a strange round , "
494660	494671	494673	494673	Skilligalee	1337	" Ah ! I see how it is , Meg , "
494675	494762	494673	494673	Skilligalee	1337	" you are in trouble about that gold . Well — never mind , old gal — so much the more reason for me to protect you . Now I tell you what it is : not all the buzmen in London can find you out at our crib in the Holy Land ; and so you shall come along with us , and you shall keep in doors the whole time : we 'll take care of you . What do you think of that ? "
494763	494766	494768	494768	Margaret	1291	" Skilligalee , "
494770	494799	494768	494768	Margaret	1291	" I am not afraid of the police : they do n't trouble themselves about me . But there is a certain man that seeks my life — — "
494800	494808	494810	494811	her companion	12574	" Oh ! if that 's all , "
494813	494852	494810	494811	her companion	12574	" make yourself perfectly easy . You do n't know yet what defences and fortifications the king has got to his palace : a regiment of swaddles[95 ] would never storm it , or take it by surprise . "
494853	494864	494866	494867	the Rattlesnake	1292	" And you really think that I shall be safe ? "
494894	494897	494899	494899	Skilligalee	1337	" Think ! "
494901	494964	494899	494899	Skilligalee	1337	" I do n't think — I'm certain . Trust to me — and all will be right . Besides , do you not pay toll to his majesty ? and where can you find a more powerful protector than King Zingary ? You will see what he can do , when once we arrive at the palace in the Holy Land . "
494965	494977	494979	494980	the Rattlesnake	1292	" But — but — will he keep all my gold ? "
494984	494991	494993	494993	Skilligalee	1337	" Not all , my dear , "
494995	495030	494993	494993	Skilligalee	1337	" One third goes to the Box;[96 ] another third to be divided amongst all us here who picked you up ; and the other remains at your own disposal . Are you content ? "
495031	495034	495036	495037	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Quite , "
495103	495106	495101	495101	he	3366	" cocking a broseley;"[97]—the
495320	495325	495327	495327	Eva	1365	" All is ready , "
495673	495710	495664	495664	Skilligalee	1337	" We will go and seat ourselves under the brow of yonder hill , and pass an hour in conversation . I have much to tell you , and you must have something to tell me . "
495711	495719	495721	495721	Margaret	1291	" I have — I have indeed ! "
495751	495765	495767	495767	Margaret	1291	" I have often read and heard of the King of the Gipsies , "
495769	495802	495767	495767	Margaret	1291	" but I always imagined that he was a fabulous character . Is that old man yonder really the King ; or has he only assumed the distinction by way of amusement ? "
495803	495816	495818	495818	Skilligalee	1337	" He is as much the sovereign of the gipsies , Margaret , "
495824	495849	495818	495818	Skilligalee	1337	" as Victoria is the Queen of England ; and more so , for the whole tribe pays him a blind and implicit obedience . "
495850	495873	495875	495876	the Rattlesnake	1292	" How came the king and his family with such strange names as those by which I heard them call each other ? "
495878	495895	495897	495897	Skilligalee	1337	" The Gipsies in England are of two distinct races , although united under one ruler , "
495899	495972	495897	495897	Skilligalee	1337	" They are Egyptian and Bohemian , and the royal family always adopts names likely to please both parties : Zingary and Aischa are , amongst the gipsies , supposed to be Egyptian names ; Morcar and Eva are held as Bohemian . The parents who have Egyptian names , give Bohemian ones to their children ; so that the rulers of the tribe are alternately looked upon as Egyptian and Bohemian . "
495973	495989	495991	495992	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Then Morcar and Eva will be king and queen at the death of Zingary ? "
495994	495998	496000	496000	Skilligalee	1337	" Just so , "
496002	496022	496024	496024	Margaret	1291	" Now tell me , who is that moody , melancholy , scowling fellow that you call the Traveller ? "
496026	496034	496024	496024	Margaret	1291	" We know but little of him , "
496039	496228	496024	496024	Margaret	1291	" He joined us — or rather , we picked him up in a state of starvation , a few miles from Liverpool , about six weeks or two months ago ; and the king has allowed him to tramp with us , because he is without friends or money . Moreover , he was anxious to get to London ; and , for some reason or other , he is afraid to be seen on the high - roads , or in the towns and villages . So our wandering life just suited his convenience ; and he feels himself safe in our company . He seldom speaks about his own affairs ; but he has said enough to enable us to understand that he has suffered deeply in consequence of the treachery of some person in whom he had put confidence , or who was his pal in former times ; and he is going up to London with the hope of finding out his enemy . He seems a desperate fellow ; and I should not like to be the person that has offended him . "
496229	496236	496238	496238	Margaret	1291	" He is not a gipsy ? "
496242	496252	496254	496254	Skilligalee	1337	" No — not a whit more than myself , "
496256	496292	496254	496254	Skilligalee	1337	" and I dare say he will leave us in London . As he was with us when we banked your rag , he will have his reg'lars , and that will set him up . "
496293	496309	496311	496312	the Rattlesnake	1292	" And you have no idea what he has been , or who he is ? "
496314	496389	496399	496400	the Rattlesnake	1292	" We never ask questions , Meg ; we listen to all that is told us , but we never seek to pry into secrets . The king was quite contented with seeing your well filled bag ; but if you remained in his company for a hundred years from this time , he would never ask you how you came by it . All impertinent curiosity is against the laws of the Zingarees . "
496390	496397	496399	496400	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Zingarees ! who are they ? "
496402	496416	496418	496418	Skilligalee	1337	" The Gipsies — with another name — that 's all , Meg , "
496420	496544	496418	496418	Skilligalee	1337	" But I was telling you about the man that we call the Traveller . When his heart has been the least thing warmed with sluicing his bolt[99 ] and cocking his broseley , he has told us strange stories of foreign countries , so that even old Zingary , who has travelled a good deal , has turned up the whites of his eyes . But there is no doubt that the sulky stranger has seen much , and gone through much also . He talks of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn , and Australia , and heaven only knows what distant places , almost as well as you and I should about the coal - hells in Staffordshire . "
496545	496559	496561	496562	the Rattlesnake	1292	" And does he mean to kill the man that has offended him ? "
496564	496571	496561	496562	the Rattlesnake	1292	" I 'll warrant he does , "
496576	496678	496561	496562	the Rattlesnake	1292	" for all that he possessed in the world , when we picked him up nearly frozen to death in a pit where he had crept for shelter,—all that he possessed besides his rags , was a long dagger , which he calls a poniard : it is as bright as silver , and so flexible that you can bend it double without breaking it . So determined is he to bury it some half dozen inches in his enemy 's heart , that he would n't even sell it , it appears , when famishing for a morsel of bread . "
496679	496688	496690	496691	the Rattlesnake	1292	" He seems a desperate - looking fellow , "
496693	496736	496690	496691	the Rattlesnake	1292	" I never beard of so terrible a man — except one ; and hell does n't contain a greater demon than him . But I will tell you all about that another time : you must answer me my questions first . "
496737	496743	496745	496745	Skilligalee	1337	" Oh ! of course , "
496752	496773	496745	496745	Skilligalee	1337	" because you are the lady , and I am the gentleman . What else do you want to know ? "
496774	496785	496690	496691	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Why , the king is going up to London ? "
496786	496846	496690	496691	the Rattlesnake	1292	" He always does at this season of the year , to meet the chiefs of the different districts , and settle a good deal of business . But you will see all about it when once we get up into the Holy Land — that is , if you 've made up your mind to go with us . "
496847	496851	496853	496854	the Rattlesnake	1292	" I have , "
496856	496879	496690	496691	the Rattlesnake	1292	" And now tell me all that has happened to you since we parted in that hurried manner — you know how . "
496880	496886	496888	496888	Skilligalee	1337	" Well — I will , "
496890	496902	496888	496888	Skilligalee	1337	" so listen attentively , as all story - tellers say . "
496922	497078	496913	496913	he	1337	" You remember the day we parted , after having lived together for nearly six months . I gave you two guineas to find your way up to London , where I recommended you to proceed to seek your fortune ; and I told you that I had as much left for myself , to help me to get away from a part of the country where the numerous burglaries I had committed had put all the constables on the alert after me . But in reality I had but two or three shillings remaining in my pocket . I knew that if I told you the real state of my finances , you would not accept so much as I had given you ; but I was afraid that you might be implicated in my difficulties , and so I was determined that you should have sufficient to convey you clear away from Staffordshire . "
497399	497662	497665	497665	he	13585	" But as I clambered up the ladder to my roosting - place , my unfortunate trousers caught a nail ; and one leg was split completely down to the foot . I was now in a most wretched dilemma , not knowing how I should contrive to mend my luckless inexpressibles . But I soon fell asleep , in spite of my unpleasant reflections ; and when I awoke , the dawn of the mild spring morning was just breaking . I examined my garment , and was reduced to despair at its appearance . At length I resolved to dress myself , go down stairs , borrow a needle and thread of the old woman , and be my own tailor . When I descended into the yard , I found a lad busily employed in cleaning a pair of boots , while a pair of trousers lay upon a bench , neatly folded up , having evidently gone through the process of brushing . I immediately recognised the stout drab pantaloons which the red - faced man wore on the preceding evening ; and my eyes dwelt longingly upon them . In reply to my questions , the boy said that his grandmother ( the old widow who kept the public - house ) was not up yet , but that he could get me a needle and thread , as he knew where she kept her work - bag . I begged him to do so ; and he very obligingly went into the house for that purpose . "
497761	497825	497758	497758	I	0	" The red - faced gentleman 's boots were a wonderful improvement upon my old broken shoes ; but his pantaloons fitted somewhat awkwardly , being a world too wide round the waist , and a foot too short in the legs . However , they were better than my old tattered unmentionables , and I could not complain that they were dear ! "
497939	498117	498118	498118	I	0	" ' So poor old Joe Dobbin 's scapegrace nephew is coming home at last ? ' said one.—'Yea , ' replied the other : ' he has been seeking his fortune , as a sailor , all over the world , for the last ten years ; and now that he has n't a penny , and is a - weary of a sea - faring life , he has written to say that he is coming home to his poor old blind uncle . '—'Ah ! Tom Tittlebat has been a wild ' un in his day , I 'll answer for it , ' said the first old man . ' But his uncle seems quite delighted at the idea of seeing him again , ' observed the other old fellow.—'He says that he shall persuade upon Tom to stay at home and take care of him ; and then he 'll be able to turn away cross old Margery , who robs him and ill - treats him in a shameful manner . ' "
498340	498439	498314	498314	I	0	" Away we went to the cottage inhabited by old Dobbin , my two aged companions really showing me the way , while I pretended to be quite familiar with it . The moment we came in sight of my alleged uncle 's residence , old Buckley and Dottings ( whose names I had found out from their own discourse with me ) hobbled forward , exclaiming , ' Here 's the prodigal returned , Brother Dobbin!'—'Kill the fatted calf , Brother Dobbin ! ' And in a few moments I was in my alleged uncle 's arms . "
498592	498695	498696	498696	I	0	" Well , the punch was made ; and there it stood steaming in an enormous bowl upon the table . I was determined to enjoy myself ; for I purposed to pack up every thing portable during the night and decamp before dawn , for fear that the rightful nephew should return before I had turned my trick to advantage . So I filled the tumblers , and plied the punch to such an extent that even old Margery 's ill - humour was overcome by the gaiety of the scene ; and she consented to sit down and join us . "
498857	498948	498837	498837	I	0	" Meantime Dame Margery , having answered the door , returned , exclaiming , ' It be Master George , ' and followed by a person whom her tall gaunt form in some measure hid from me until they were both close to the table . Then what a dreadful scene took place ! In cousin George , to my horror and dismay , I beheld the red - faced man that I 'd met at the Three Compasses , and whose drab trousers adorned me at that very moment ! "
499166	499265	499266	499266	My	0	" But this turn did not serve me . While I spoke , cousin George surveyed me attentively ; and , again rushing upon me , he roared out , ' He 's a cheat ! he 's an impostor ! Tom has a mole on the left cheek , and he 's none : Tom has a cut over the right eye , and he has n't . Go for a constable . '—'Well , I thought all along he was a rogue , ' cried Dame Margery , hurrying off to execute this most unpleasant order . "
499369	499415	499352	499352	I	0	" Away I scudded — a hue and cry after me : but I ran like a race - horse ; and in a few minutes was beyond the sound of the ' Stop , thief , ' raised by cousin George 's ominous voice . "
499464	499571	499456	499456	they	13626	" I strolled along through the fields , diverting myself with reflection upon the past , and pondering upon what might be in store for the future , until I reached a large market town , where I went boldly to the tap - room of the principal tavern . I ordered an excellent supper , with plenty of ale , feeling convinced that some lucky adventure would enable me to pay for my cheer — for I had now but one shilling left , the remainder of my money having been spent at the inn where I met the two old acquaintances of blind Dobbin . "
499810	500248	499796	499796	they	13630	" At twelve o'clock the waiter came in , and bawled out , ' Any more orders , gentlemen ? any more orders ? ' No answer being given , he said , ' I will receive each gentleman 's account , if you please . '—This announcement came like a clap of thunder upon me : I had but a shilling in my pocket , and owed nearly three . What to do I could not tell . Meantime the waiter went round , collecting the money due to him from each individual ; and the nearer he drew to the table where I was sitting , the more fidgetty I became . As I glanced round me with feverish anxiety , I saw the dark black eyes of the sallow - faced stranger fixed upon me ; and I thought that they glared with fiendish delight , as if they had penetrated my secret . I felt ashamed — and my eyes fell beneath the demon - like glance . In another moment the waiter stood before me . ' Now , sir — if you please , sir : steak , one shilling — taturs , penny — bread , penny — fourteen - pence ; two pints of ale , eight - pence — screw of bakker , penny — pot porter , four - pence,—that 's two - and - three , sir . ' I sat aghast for a few minutes , and then began to fumble in my pockets , the waiter every moment growing more impatient . At that instant the sallow - faced stranger pointed to the bench on which I was sitting , and said in a surly tone , ' No wonder , young man , that you ca n't find your money in your pocket , when you let it roll about in all directions . ' He then sank back into his corner , and seemed to take no more notice of me or my concerns . I thought he had a mind to banter me ; but , turning my eyes towards the place which he had indicated , to my surprise I perceived a couple of half - crowns lying there . I am sure the waiter must have seen how my countenance brightened up with sudden joy ; but he made no remark ; and I paid my bill . He then passed on to the sallow - faced man , who settled his own account , and hastily left the room , without condescending to cast another glance upon me . "
500376	500883	500893	500894	a person	3238	" Elbowing my way through the graziers , drovers , and butchers , I got into the middle of the market , and there a most extraordinary spectacle met my eyes . A man was leading a woman along by a halter , which was tied round her neck . At first , I thought that a public execution was about to take place ; but , seeing no gibbet — no police — no sheriffs — and no clergyman,—and observing , at a second glance , that the woman was giggling and laughing very much unlike a person just going to be hanged , I was at a loss to account for so strange a sight . The crowd appeared to enjoy the fun — for fun it evidently was — excessively ; and , at length , I learnt that ' Bob Fosset , the dog's - meat - man , was about to sell his wife to Will Wyatt , the costermonger . ' And , sure enough , such was the fact . Bob Fossett led his wife — a comely - looking woman enough — to the centre of the market , and tied the halter to a sheep - pen . He then mounted on the top bar of the pen , and shouted out : ' I hereby put up my wife , Jenny Fossett , to public auction ; and I declare that she shall go to the highest bidder . '—'So I will , Bob , ' cried the woman.—'Hooray , Bob Fossett , ' bawled the crowd assembled ; and then there was such laughing , and joking , and sky - larking , it seemed for all the world just like a fair . Well , Will Wyatt steps forward , and exclaims : ' I bid one shilling for that woman . '—'One shilling bid , ' said Bob Fossett.—'One shilling and a pot of beer , ' cries some wag in the crowd.—'One shilling and a pot of beer is bid , ' shouts Fossett ; ' who bids any more?'—'One shilling and a gallon of beer ! ' bawls Will Wyatt.—'One shilling and a gallon of beer for this woman ! ' cries Bob Fossett : ' who 'll advance on that ? Going for one shilling and a gallon of beer : going — going,—will no one bid?—gone ! Will Wyatt , my lad , that woman 's yours ! ' So Will Wyatt steps forward , kisses the woman , takes off the halter , and tacks her under his arm as cozy as if they 'd just been spliced at church . Then they all three went off to the nearest public - house , the crowds hooraying , and shouting , and squeaking , and roaring , as they made way for the party to pass along . I determined to see the remainder of the fun , and so I followed them to the public - house . "
501145	501249	501130	501130	he	2092	" You may imagine how astonished I was at the ominous words which he had whispered in my ear ; but , collecting my ideas , I began to feel alarmed for my safety ; and , having no longer any interest in the party whom I had followed into the public - house , I abruptly departed — without partaking of , or paying for , the refreshment which I had ordered . Hurrying away from the place , I got out of the town as quick as possible ; and , avoiding the main - road , struck into the fields . "
501780	502232	502233	502233	I	0	" The stranger and his companion hastened away towards the place where I was to meet them again , and I proceeded towards the farm . It was by no means difficult to gain admittance into the kitchen of that hospitable establishment : a simple request for a cup of milk led to an invitation from a buxom cook and a smart servant - maid to walk in and rest myself a little . Then bread and cheese , and a foaming tankard of home - brewed were set before me ; and , while I ate and drank , I gradually drew the two women into the conversation which suited my purpose . They proclaimed the praises of ' master and missis ; ' and told me how the old people were very well off ; and how Miss Jemima , the eldest daughter , was engaged to a young farmer in the neighbourhood ; how Miss Mary , the second daughter , had been courted by an officer in the army who had been quartered in the neighbouring town , but who had since left , and had never written to her afterwards ; and how Miss Frances , the youngest , had been very melancholy ever since she had visited an aunt at Stafford , where it was well known an attorney 's clerk had paid her very great attention . These , and various other particulars relative to the family , were related to me in the course of conversation ; and , having remained at the farm for a couple of hours , I was about to take my leave , as well informed relative to the inmates as if I had lived with them all my life . But just as I was rising to depart , I espied a purse lying in a work - box upon a shelf ; and I began to reflect how I could make it my own . Accident served my purpose : the cook insisted upon drawing me some more ale , and went into the cellar for that purpose ; and the maid - servant stepped to the door of the kitchen to receive a can of milk which a boy brought there at the moment . To dart toward the shelf and secure the purse was the work of an instant ; and when the maid turned towards me again , I was sitting as composedly as if I had never left my chair . The cook made her appearance with the ale , of which I drank ; and I then took my leave , with many thanks for the kind entertainment I had received . "
502370	502672	502679	502683	The red - faced man	13581	" Considerably cheered at this change in my pecuniary position , I pursued my way until long after dusk , when I entered a village where I determined to put up for the night . Having supped at a public - house , I inquired about a bed , and found that I could be accommodated with one in a double - bedded room , the other being already retained by a traveller who had arrived before me , but who had stepped out , I was informed , to transact some business with certain inhabitants of his acquaintance . Being tired , I went up to the room where I was to sleep , before the return of the person who was to occupy the other bed ; but before I sought my own nest I looked about for a secure spot where I could conceal my purse , as I fancied that my companion might probably be no more honest than myself . I accordingly hid my treasure between the mattress and the sacking ; and , putting my clothes under my pillow , lay down to rest . I soon fell into a deep sleep , from which I did not awake until aroused by the noise of some one moving about the room . I started up , and rubbing my eyes , asked what o'clock it was . The person who occupied the other bed was shaving himself at a looking - glass , with his back turned towards me ; but the moment my voice fell upon his ears , he started round ; and — to my horror — I recognised but too well , beneath a thick coat of lather , the never - to - be - forgotten countenance of cousin George . "
502837	502985	502813	502813	he	2908	" I did not choose to drag forth my purse from its place of concealment , for fear it might involve me in a worse dilemma than that in which I found myself , and which , after all , was not particularly serious . I however left it beneath the mattress , with deep regret , and was led away by the constable , every soul in the public - house turning out to witness my departure . The landlord , moreover , gave me a parting blessing after a fashion — accusing me as a thief who had run up a score of three shillings and seven - pence halfpenny at his house , without the slightest means of paying it ! To this very natural conclusion he came , inasmuch as the constable , upon searching me , had found nothing in my pockets . "
503285	503546	503547	503548	The procession	10136	" While I was pent up in the out - house , I went up to the window and looked out upon that open country which seemed the scene of a freedom now lost to me . As I was standing there , pondering on my condition , and wondering whether the numerous burglaries which I had committed in a neighbourhood not very far distant , would be brought against me , my attention was suddenly attracted to a number of people who were advancing rapidly towards the house . As they drew near , to my surprise I recognised the swarthy stranger and his female companion , both evidently in the custody of two constables , and followed by the cook , maid - servant , and other persons belonging to the farm - house . An idea of the real truth instantly flashed through my mind ; and I felt sorry — very sorry for the two poor creatures who , I had no doubt , were suffering under a suspicion of the robbery which I had perpetrated . Moreover , I could not help thinking that the swarthy man and the sallow - faced man were one and the same person , and that the two half - crowns had been purposely thrown in my way by him , at the inn in the market - town , to relieve me from that embarrassment into which his keen eyes had penetrated . These reflections suddenly filled me with deep interest in the stranger and his female companion . "
503971	504349	503961	503962	The constable	2911	" The moment I entered the room , the gipsy - man and his companion exhibited the greatest surprise and interest . I gave them a re - assuring glance ; and then , turning towards the magistrate , I said , ' Your worship , these two poor creatures are innocent of the crime imputed to them . '—'How do you know ? ' demanded the justice roughly , for his lunch - time was now drawing near.—'Because I stole it myself , ' was my answer . The greatest astonishment pervaded the assembly ; joy animated the countenance of the two gipsies ; while the cook and maid servant cried out , ' Dear me ! ' and ' Who would have thought it ! ' as loud as they could . The justice looked tremendous savage , and declared that he would order the room to be cleared of strangers if they interrupted the business in that indecent manner ! I was then called upon to explain the assertion which I had made.—'These two persons , ' I said , pointing towards the gipsies , ' are accused of stealing a purse from farmer Clodhopper 's kitchen?'—'They are . Well?'—'Then they did n't steal it , because I stole it myself ; and these servants can prove that I was there yesterday afternoon . '—'So he was ! ' exclaimed the cook and maid in the same breath.—'And now , ' I continued , ' if you will send and search under the mattress of the bed which I slept in last night at the public - house where I was arrested , you will find the purse . ' But this trouble was avoided ; for scarcely had I uttered these words , when in came the landlord of that public - house , holding the purse in his hands . His wife , it appeared , had found it when making the beds ; and suspicion instantly pointed to me as the person who had placed it in the spot where it was discovered . This circumstance brought the case safe home to me ; and the gipsies were instantly discharged , with a warning to take care of themselves in future ! "
504427	504626	504413	504413	I	0	" I was taken back to the out - house , with another serious charge hanging over my head ; and the cart was every moment expected to convey me to the county gaol . But time slipped away , and it did not arrive . At length the constable became impatient , and talked about the impropriety of trifling with the time of a public officer like him , adding that he did n't know if he should n't write to the prime minister about it . Presently the man - servant came in with some dinner for him — but not a bite nor a sup for me ! Neither did the constable offer me any thing . ' Here 's a pretty business , ' says the servant ; ' the man that was to drive you over to the county gaol has got drunk somehow or other , and ca n't go ; and the horse has suddenly gone dead lame . '—'What 's to be done , then ? ' cried the constable.—'Why , you must wait till the man 's sober , and the veterinary surgeon has looked to the horse . ' "
504797	504974	504780	504782	the swarthy gipsy	13764	" Away we went at a rattling pace : it was soon dark , and the constable told the driver not to go at such a rate . But he did not obey the command : on the contrary , he whipped the horse the more ; and the cart bounded along the road as if it was for wager . The constable swore and prayed by turns : the driver laughed ; and presently the cart upset into a dry ditch . ' Run for your liberty ! ' cried the driver to me , as he pulled me from the ditch ; and I followed him across the fields with a speed that was increased by hearing the constable shouting ' Stop , thief ! ' behind me . But in a very few minutes those cries became fainter and fainter , until they at length ceased altogether . Still my deliverer pursued his way , and at such a rate , too , that I was scarcely able to keep up with him . "
505063	505788	505040	505041	my companion	35712	" ' You must be informed , ' he said , ' that my name is Morcar , and that I am the son of Zingary , king of the gipsies . The female whom you saw with me yesterday and this morning , is my wife . A considerable portion of the money earned by our race consists of fees paid by the simple and credulous , for having their fortunes told . In order to obtain the necessary information relative to the inhabitants of those places or dwellings which we visit , we are compelled to assume many disguises , or to make use of the agency of others , not connected with us , to gather that information for us . Some days ago , at an early hour in the morning , I was loitering about in the neighbourhood of the Three Compasses , and from behind a hedge saw you make off with the boots and trousers which a boy had been brushing in the yard . Chance led me that same afternoon to the village where you played your famous trick upon old Dobbin ; and , as the story spread like wild - fire through the place immediately after your detection by cousin George , I could not avoid hearing all the particulars . I got a lift in a cart from that village to the market - town where I met you the same night at the inn . I could not help admiring your boldness and ingenuity ; and , while I sat quietly smoking my pipe in the tap - room , listening to the discourse of the inmates , and picking up a variety of information , to be turned to future account , I noticed your embarrassment at the appearance of the waiter to collect the money owing by each individual . I had made a good day 's work in a certain way , and was disposed to be liberal : accordingly , at a moment when you were turned in another direction , I placed the two half - crowns close by where you sate on the bench . Next day I threw off what I call my ' sallow disguise ' , and repaired to another public - house , near the market , to glean additional information , all of which our women have since turned to ample profit . Then I was enabled to give you a warning which was really important to you , as old Dobbin 's cousin George had actually arrived that morning in the town to attend the market . A few days afterwards I was roving with my wife along the by - lanes in the neighbourhood of Clodhopper 's farm , endeavouring by some means to glean what we could concerning the young women at that place — for our finest harvests are always reaped at farm - houses . Again I met you ; and I made you the instrument of my design . But , ' added Morcar , with a smile , ' you went farther than you were instructed : you did a thing which we never do — I mean , steal money . We take for our use a sucking - pig , a fowl , or a goose ; and we do not consider that stealing . We also snare rabbits and game ; and we look upon it as no crime . However , you saw the scrape into which that business of the purse got me and my wife this morning . You saved us , and I vowed to save you also . The moment I was discharged I went to the stable where the horse that was to convey you to gaol was kept , and bribed the ostler to drive a nail into his foot so as to touch the flesh . Then I found the man who was to drive you , and plied him so well with liquor that he was unable to perform his duty . My object was to delay your journey until the evening , because I knew that I could ensure your escape in the dark . You have seen how well my plans have succeeded , because you are now free . ' "
505934	506037	506038	506047	THE wanderer amidst the crowded thoroughfares of the multitudinous metropolis	13775	" I accepted the welcome offers of Morcar , and that very night was conducted to the encampment where his father and mother had taken up their quarters . Eva presented her son to me , saying , ' You have preserved for this little one a father and mother : henceforth the Zingarees will know thee as a friend ! ' From that moment I have lived with the gipsies until the present time ; and , though some years have passed away since I first joined them , I have not yet become weary of our wandering mode of existence . "
506329	506333	506362	506372	any one who had the right of entry into the habitation	13796	" the lobby , "
507158	507309	507150	507151	the king	3366	" Most loyal and dutiful friends , this is the hundred and thirty - first anniversary of the institution of that custom in virtue of which the provincial rulers of the united races of Egyptians and Bohemians in England assemble together once every year at the Palace . A hundred and thirty - one years ago , this house was purchased by my grandfather King Sisman , and bequeathed to his descendants to serve as the head - quarters and central point of our administration . There is scarcely an individual of the united races who has not experienced the hospitality of this Palace . Every worthy Zingaree who visits the metropolis enjoys his bed and his board without fee and without price for seven days in our mansion , the superintendence of which is so ably conducted , while we are absent , by our brother on my right . "
507326	507409	507311	507312	the king	3366	" In his hands our treasures are safe ; and to - morrow he will place before you an account of the remittances he has received from the provincial districts , and the expenditures he has made in the maintenance of this establishment . You will find , I have reason to believe , a considerable balance in our favour . Let us then celebrate with a bumper the hundred and thirty - first anniversary of the opening of our royal palace ! "
507430	507435	507437	507438	the king	3366	" My pretty Eva , "
507444	507453	507437	507438	the king	3366	" will now oblige us with a song ? "
507490	507497	507499	507500	the king	3366	" Thank you , sweet Eva , "
507528	507536	507538	507538	Zingary	953	" Ours is indeed a happy life , "
507540	507717	507538	507538	Zingary	953	" When roving over the broad country , we enjoy a freedom unknown to the rest of the world . No impost or taxes have we then to pay : we drink of the stream at pleasure , and never feel alarmed lest our water should be cut off . We can choose pleasant paths , and yet pay no paving - rate . The sun lights us by day , and the stars by night ; and no one comes to remind us that we owe two quarters ' gas . We pitch our tents where we will , but are not afraid of a ground - landlord . We do not look forward with fear and trembling to Lady - day or Michaelmas , for the broker can not distress us . We move where we like , without dreading an accusation of shooting the moon . In fine , we are as free and independent as the inhabitants of the desert . A health , then , to the united races of Zingarees ! "
507765	507772	507730	507731	the king	3366	" COME HITHER , FAIR MAIDEN . "
508016	508038	508009	508009	he	7829	" Another day is gone — and he still lives : but I will never rest until I trace him out . "
508337	508341	508343	508344	the visitor	28468	" Mr. Markham , "
508355	508526	508343	508344	the visitor	28468	" you are , perhaps , surprised to see me here , especially after the manner in which we parted . I am come to demand a favour , and not to reproach you:—indeed , I have no right to use the word reproach towards you at all . You conducted yourself like an honourable man in respect to me : you taught my sons no lessons save those by which they have profited . If you erred in early life , you have no doubt repented;—and shall man dare to withhold that pardon which the Lord vouchsafes to all who implore it ? I beheld your triumph at the theatre — would to God that nothing had sullied it ! I beheld your fall — and I commisserated you . But before that there were reasons — cogent reasons which forbade me to continue the cultivation of your friendship ; and as a man of honour and of good taste , you have not sought mine since we parted . "
508527	508533	508620	508621	Mr. Gregory	1261	" Before you proceed farther , "
508535	508613	508343	508344	the visitor	28468	Richard,—"for I see that you have some business of more or less importance to discuss with me,—allow me to inform you that I was not overpowered by guilt on that fatal night when I was so cruelly denounced at the theatre . The consciousness of crime did not strike me level with the dust . I fell beneath a reaction of feelings too powerful for human nature to struggle with . The proofs of my innocence — — "
508614	508618	508620	508621	Mr. Gregory	1261	" Your innocence ! "
508627	508634	508620	508621	Mr. Gregory	1261	" your innocence , say you ? "
508635	508641	508643	508643	Markham	874	" Yes — my innocence , "
508653	508672	508643	508643	Markham	874	" for I can glory in that innocence , and assert it boldly and without fear of contradiction . "
508673	508684	508686	508687	Mr. Gregory	1261	" In the name of God , explain your meaning ! "
508699	508715	508721	508721	he	5194	" I mean that I was the victim of the most infernal treachery ever planned , "
508735	508754	508756	508757	this gentleman	2368	" Oh ! now , indeed , I can make my proposal to you with joy and honour ! "
508759	508833	508756	508757	this gentleman	2368	" for you must know , Mr. Markham , that my daughter loves you , and has for some time loved you with the most pure , the most holy , and the most ardent affection ! But you saw that she loved you — you were not blind to that passion which her ingenuous nature would not allow her to conceal : you knew that her heart was fondly devoted to you . "
508834	508841	508843	508843	Markham	874	" And most solemnly I declare , "
508845	508864	508843	508843	Markham	874	" that neither by word nor deed did I ever encourage that feeling in Miss Gregory 's heart . "
508865	508870	508872	508877	the father of that young lady	13917	" I believe you , "
508879	508947	508872	508877	the father of that young lady	13917	" for I noticed that you were often reserved when she was gay and friendly towards you . And it was to separate her from the object of her affection that I parted with you as the tutor of my sons ; for it was not until the disclosure at the theatre that I learnt the sad accusation under which you had laboured in your early youth . "
508961	509232	508948	508949	Mr. Gregory	1261	" I hoped that my daughter 's happiness was not altogether compromised by her love for you;—I removed her to a change of scene ; and there an accident threw her into the society of a charming family , with whom she passed about ten days . At the beginning of this week I fetched her home to my house in Kentish Town ; but I found that she was more melancholy than ever . Her naturally joyous and lively disposition has changed to mourning and sorrow . I have not , however , told her that I am acquainted with her secret : I know not whether she even suspects that I have penetrated it . I have studiously avoided all mention of your name ; and she never alludes to you by word . But she thinks of you always ! She nourished a flame which consumes her ! Now I am come , Mr. Markham , to propose to you the hand of my daughter,—to propose it to you with frankness and candour ! I know that the step which I am taking is an unusual one — perhaps an improper one;—but the safety — the happiness — the life of my daughter compels me thus to depart from the usages of society . If your heart be not otherwise engaged — and I never heard you hint that such was the case,—and if you think that the charms and accomplishments of Mary - Anne are worthy of your notice,—in addition to the handsome fortune which my means enable me to settle upon her,—in that case — — "
509233	509238	509240	509240	Richard	874	" My dear sir , "
509250	509276	508948	508949	Mr. Gregory	1261	own,—"you have honoured me with this proposal;—and , under other circumstances , I should have been no doubt gratified — but — it is impossible ! "
509277	509280	509282	509283	Mr. Gregory	1261	" Impossible ! "
509292	509335	509282	509283	Mr. Gregory	1261	" Yes — impossible ! I appreciate your daughter 's great merits — I admire her personal beauty — I respect her excellent qualities,—and I could have loved her dearly as a sister;—but my heart — that is not mine to give ! "
509336	509343	509345	509346	Mr. Gregory	1261	" What ? You love another ! "
509348	509372	509345	509346	Mr. Gregory	1261	" For some time my affections have been devoted to a young lady , who has confessed a reciprocal attachment to me — — "
509373	509378	509380	509382	the unhappy father	13919	" Enough — enough ! "
509384	509421	509380	509382	the unhappy father	13919	" for my poor daughter there is now no hope ! But you , Mr. Markham , will forget that this proposal was ever made;—you will bury the particulars of this visit of mine in oblivion ? "
509422	509435	509436	509437	Mr. Gregory	1261	" With me the secret of your daughter 's heart is sacred . "
509687	509698	509700	509702	the fellow brutally	13930	" Why the devil do n't you use your eyes ? "
509740	509743	509744	509744	he	874	" Wretch ! "
509762	509775	509744	509744	he	874	" we have met at last where you shall not escape me ! "
509776	509782	509784	509786	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Damnation ! Richard Markham ! "
510036	510042	510044	510046	a gruff voice	13946	" What do you want ? "
510058	510063	510065	510067	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Open — open ! "
510069	510081	510065	510067	the Resurrection Man	3220	" let me in , and I will reward you well . "
510136	510145	510132	510133	the villain	3773	" I have done them , by God ! "
510146	510151	510153	510168	the man who had opened the door , and who had the appearance of a gipsy	13951	" Who are you ? "
510170	510186	510132	510133	the villain	3773	" Judging by the way in which your house is secured , my good friend , "
510191	510220	510132	510133	the villain	3773	" there can be no harm in telling you that I am persecuted by blue - bottles — a race which can not be altogether unknown to you . "
510221	510226	510228	510229	the gipsy	13952	" That 's enough , "
510231	510240	510228	510229	the gipsy	13952	" you are safe here . Follow me . "
510365	510401	510362	510362	he	3220	" If I am not mistaken , this is the crib where the famous race of Bohemians and Egyptians are accustomed to meet in London . I claim of them hospitality for a few hours . "
510402	510412	510414	510415	the King	3366	" As long as suits your interests , friend , "
510417	510427	510362	510362	he	3220	" Sit down , and do as we do . "
510470	510476	510478	510479	the King	3366	" Booze and be merry , "
510481	510532	510533	510533	he	3366	" we shall have nothing to interrupt our merriment to - night ; the women have all gone to roost , that they may get up early , for we leave the Holy Land to - morrow morning . At five o'clock we depart . But you , my friend , "
510543	510579	510533	510533	he	3366	" are welcome to remain here a day or two , if such a plan suits your safety , as I suppose it does . We leave an intendant of our royal palace behind us . "
510596	510606	510608	510609	this individual	2292	" All is quiet up stairs , your majesty , "
510611	510639	510608	510609	this individual	2292	" and so I suppose the women are gone to the downy . They all seem glad at the idea of leaving London to - morrow morning . "
510640	510653	510655	510656	the King	3366	" And none more so , I think , than your Margaret , "
510662	510681	510682	510684	The Resurrection Man	3220	" She seems dreadfully afraid of that man who , she says , is in pursuit of her . "
510701	510707	510709	510709	Skilligalee	1337	" If you knew all , "
510711	510745	510709	510709	Skilligalee	1337	" you would not blame her . It appears that the fellow is a perfect demon . His regular trade is in dead bodies ; and so he ca n't be very nice . "
510746	510756	510762	510762	himself	3220	" It is the Rattlesnake — it must be ! "
510948	510965	510967	510967	Skilligalee	1337	" Poor Meg is terribly put out because she has lost all her companions up stairs , "
510969	510988	510967	510967	Skilligalee	1337	" She could n't bear the idea of sleeping all alone in the great room just over this . "
510989	511006	511008	511010	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Then she should get married , and have a husband to take care of her , "
511029	511042	511044	511044	Skilligalee	1337	" And so she has some one to take care of her , "
511046	511072	511044	511044	Skilligalee	1337	" and that 's me . But there 's one rule in this place — men sleep in their rooms , and women in theirs . "
511073	511088	511090	511090	Zingary	953	" We ca n't split the palace into a hundred different bed - chambers , "
511092	511096	511098	511100	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Certainly not , "
511102	511122	511098	511100	the Resurrection Man	3220	" But surely the lady you are talking of ca n't be afraid in such a fortress as this ? "
511123	511130	511132	511132	Skilligalee	1337	" But she is , though , "
511134	511159	511160	511160	he	3220	" The women that occupied the same room with her went away this morning , because the court is going out of town again , "
511168	511197	511205	511207	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Meg wanted to move into her majesty 's room ; but Aischa and Eva told her that she must learn to get rid of her stupid fears . "
511198	511203	511205	511207	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And very properly , "
511209	511218	511220	511220	Skilligalee	1337	" But never mind these matters of talk , "
511222	511251	511220	511220	Skilligalee	1337	" they 're only domestic , after all . Come , I 'll sing you a song , as it 's the last night we shall be here . "
511312	511315	511317	511318	the King	3366	" Skilligalee , "
511320	511359	511317	511318	the King	3366	" you will tell the trap - faker[100 ] that the Traveller is the only one out ; and you will conduct our new guest to the strangers ' ward . Lieges and friends , good - night . "
511503	511511	511512	511512	he	1337	" Trap - faker , old fellow , "
511515	511541	511512	511512	he	1337	" the Traveller is out late to - night ; but I suppose he means to come back . He 's the only one abroad . "
511542	511546	511548	511549	the porter	2789	" All right , "
511551	511558	511559	511559	Skilligalee	1337	" I 'll attend to him . "
511979	511982	511983	511983	he	998	" Margaret ! "
512048	512055	512057	512059	the Resurrection Man	3220	" If you cause an alarm , "
512070	512100	512057	512059	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I 'll cut your throat that minute . I want to speak to you ; and if you tell me the truth I will do you no harm . "
512166	512171	512173	512176	the Resurrection Man,—"one word	38745	" Now , mind , "
512175	512186	512187	512187	He	3220	Man,—"one word to disturb the house — and you die ! "
512232	512238	512240	512240	Tidkins	998	" You see , Margaret , "
512242	512289	512240	512240	Tidkins	998	" no one can escape me : sooner or later I fall in with those who thwart or injure me . But we have not much time for idle chattering . In one word ; what have you done with the money you stole from me ? "
512290	512298	512300	512301	the woman	27628	" The gipsies have got it all , "
512311	512326	512300	512301	the woman	27628	" but a part of it is mine whenever I choose to claim it . "
512327	512338	512340	512342	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Who has got it ? Where is it kept ? "
512352	512359	512340	512342	the Resurrection Man	3220	" The king of the gipsies . "
512360	512371	512240	512240	Tidkins	998	" What — the old fool with a white beard ? "
512372	512376	512300	512301	the woman	27628	" The same . "
512377	512388	512340	512342	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And where does he keep it , I say ? "
512389	512409	512240	512240	Tidkins	998	" I have been told that the bag containing the gipsies ' treasure is always placed under his bolster . "
512410	512417	512419	512421	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Are you sure of that ? "
512423	512426	512240	512240	Tidkins	998	" Certain , "
512465	512473	512442	512442	she	1291	" Has any of it been spent ? "
512474	512479	512481	512482	the Rattlesnake	1292	" No — no , "
512532	512547	512549	512551	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Do you know where the king , as you call him , sleeps ? "
512553	512568	512570	512570	Margaret	1291	" Yes — I am acquainted with every nook and corner of this place , "
512582	512590	512592	512594	the Resurrection Man	3220	" But he does not sleep alone , "
512596	512613	512592	512594	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I know all about that . How many men occupy the same room with him ? "
512614	512620	512663	512665	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Only his son Morcar . "
512621	512626	512592	512594	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Are they armed ? "
512627	512630	512632	512633	the Rattlesnake	1292	" No , "
512635	512656	512632	512633	the Rattlesnake	1292	" they have nothing — or fancy they have nothing — to fear : this house is so well guarded ! "
512657	512661	512663	512665	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Now listen , "
512671	512714	512663	512665	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I have no time to waste in words . Will you conduct me to the room where this king of yours sleeps , and help me to get back my gold ? or will you have your throat cut this minute ? "
512734	512752	512754	512755	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Oh ! put away that horrid thing , and I will do all you tell me ! "
512773	512786	512788	512788	Tidkins	998	" Well — I do n't want to do you any harm , "
512797	512831	512835	512835	he	998	" But I warn you , that if you attempt any treachery , I will shoot you upon the spot without an instant 's hesitation , let the consequences be what they may . "
512855	512864	512866	512867	the woman	27628	" You need not threaten me , Tony , "
512903	512913	512915	512915	Tidkins	1061	" None of that nonsense with me , Meg , "
512917	512943	512915	512915	Tidkins	1061	" it has deceived me before . But I warn you ! So now jump up and lead the way to the king 's room . "
512979	512985	512986	512986	she	1291	" Shall I dress myself ? "
512989	513033	512986	512986	she	1291	" What for ? You do n't think that you 're going away with me — do you ? No , no ; I shall leave you in the excellent company which you have chosen for yourself , and with your friend Skilligalee . "
513057	513066	513068	513070	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Take the light , and go first , "
513534	513537	513539	513539	Morcar	1364	" Villain ! "
513550	513559	513539	513539	Morcar	1364	" is this the reward of our hospitality ? "
513560	513571	513573	513575	the Resurrection Man	3220	" It 's mine — and I can prove it , "
513577	513600	513573	513575	the Resurrection Man	3220	" But let me go — I do n't want to hurt any of you — and you need n't hurt me . "
513601	513607	513609	513610	the Traveller	7829	" Ah ! that voice ! "
513685	513696	513698	513698	Morcar	1364	" He is not dead — but he is dying , "
513708	513714	513716	513717	the Traveller	7829	" Tell him , then , "
513726	513757	513716	513717	the Traveller	7829	joy,—"tell him that the man who was transported four years ago by his infernal treachery has at length been avenged,—tell him that he dies by the hand of Crankey Jem ! "
514075	514078	514079	514079	he	953	" Margaret , "
514087	514423	514079	514079	he	953	" you are now in the presence of the secret tribunal of the united races of Zingarees . Our association , existing by conventional rules and laws of its own making , and to a certain degree independent of those which govern the country wherein we dwell , has been compelled to frame severe statutes to meet extreme cases . One of our customs is hospitality ; and you have seen enough of us to know that we ask but few questions of those who seek our charity or our protection . It necessarily happens that persons who so come amongst us , learn much of our mode of life and many of our proceedings . But the basest ingratitude alone could reward our generous hospitality with a treacherous betrayal of any matters , the communication of which might militate against our interests . Although we have no sympathy and no dealings with the thieves and rogues of this great metropolis , we never refuse them the security of this establishment , when accident or previous acquaintance with its existence leads them to seek the safety of its walls . This conduct on our part has been pursued upon grounds of generosity and policy;—generosity , because we believe that half the criminals in existence are rather the victims of bad laws than of their own perverse natures;—policy , because we wish to keep on good terms with all orders and classes who live in violation of the law . It , however , behoves us to adopt as much precaution as possible against treachery , and to punish treachery where we detect it , and when the perpetrator of it is in our power . With this view the secret tribunal was instituted at the same time that this establishment was first opened , more than a century ago . Margaret , you are now in the presence of that tribunal , and you are accused of treachery and ingratitude of the very blackest dye . "
514510	514519	514521	514522	King Zingary	953	" What are the facts of this case ? "
514528	514658	514521	514522	King Zingary	953	" you , Margaret , are discovered by us one morning , sleeping in the open air , and nearly dead with the cold . You have a treasure with you , which we might have appropriated altogether to ourselves , but a third of which has been held at your disposal — yours at any time you might choose to demand it . You come amongst us ; you are treated by us with even more than usual attention and kindness ; and you are allowed to associate with our wives and daughters without the least restraint . A fortnight scarcely elapses , when you conduct a robber into my room , and point to him the place where he may find the treasure belonging to the association . "
514659	514666	514668	514668	Margaret	1291	" Hear me — hear me ! "
514677	514687	514668	514668	Margaret	1291	" hear me — and I will explain all . "
514688	514691	514693	514694	the king	3366	" Speak , "
514696	514705	514707	514708	the Rattlesnake	1292	" I am not guilty of premeditated ingratitude , "
514710	514864	514707	514708	the Rattlesnake	1292	" I awoke in the middle of the night , and found a fiend in human shape hanging over me . That man was the one whom I had been so anxious to avoid — of whom I was so afraid . I admit that I had robbed him of the gold which you found with me ; but I was not bound to tell you that before now . Well — I awoke , and he was hanging over me ! How he came into the house , you best know ; how he knew that I was an inmate of it , I can not explain ; how he discovered my room is also a mystery . Nevertheless — he did find me out ; and with dreadful threats of instant death he made me lead him to your apartment to get back his gold . That is the whole truth . "
514876	514893	514894	514894	he	953	" Why did you not give the alarm , when once you were in my chamber ? "
514897	514936	514894	514894	he	953	" Even if I am old and feeble , was not Morcar there ? and could you not in one moment have summoned the others to your aid , by touching the bell - rope within your reach ? "
514937	514970	514972	514973	the Rattlesnake	1292	" And , had I done so , that instant would have been my last . The fearful man , whom I obeyed , would have shot me dead on the spot , "
514975	514990	514992	514993	the king	3366	" And do you not know how to die rather than betray your companions ? "
514995	515006	515008	515008	Margaret	1291	" I am but a woman — a weak woman , "
515010	515028	515008	515008	Margaret	1291	" and — oh ! no — no — I could not die so horrible a death ! "
515029	515039	515041	515041	Zingary	953	" Our women would die in such a cause , "
515043	515061	515041	515041	Zingary	953	" and those who join us and live with us must learn our customs and our habits . "
515062	515100	515008	515008	Margaret	1291	" Remember how sudden was the appearance of that man — how awful were his threats — in the middle of the night — and a knife , I may say , at my very throat — — "
515101	515263	515277	515278	the Rattlesnake	1292	" It is a most extraordinary thing , that the very man whom you so much dreaded should have happened to seek our hospitality within a fortnight after you had joined us . Am I wrong if I entertain a suspicion in that respect ? You knew that the bag , which every night was deposited beneath my head , contained not only the greater part of the gold which you brought us , but also the year 's contributions from the tribes and districts : you knew all this , because we had no secrets from you . Then , perhaps , you were tired of our company ; and you imagined that it would be an easy thing to make your peace with that man whom you so much feared , by putting him in possession of a larger treasure than the one you plundered from him,—a treasure , too , which you might hope to share with him . "
515264	515275	515277	515278	the Rattlesnake	1292	" As I live , that was not the case ! "
515282	515313	515277	515278	the Rattlesnake	1292	" You know that I have never stirred out of this house once since I first crossed the threshold : how , then , could I communicate with that man ? "
515314	515329	515331	515332	the king	3366	" Where there is a will , there generally is a way , Margaret , "
515334	515346	515331	515332	the king	3366	" Have you any thing further to urge in your defence ? "
515347	515354	515356	515357	the woman	27628	" I have told the truth , "
515359	515366	515356	515357	the woman	27628	" what more can I say ? "
515367	515373	515375	515375	Zingary	953	" Then you may retire , "
515493	515496	515490	515491	the majority	14095	" Guilty . "
515530	515638	515521	515521	Zingary	953	" This tribunal , Margaret , has duly deliberated upon the case in which you are so especially interested . The result of that deliberation is , that you are found guilty of the blackest treachery and ingratitude . The founders of this tribunal wisely ordained that it should only pronounce one penalty in all cases which terminated in convictions ; and that penalty is one which does not enable the criminal to return to the world to seek at the hands of the country 's tribunals redress for what such criminal might deem to be an injustice practised by this court . That penalty is death ! "
515639	515642	515521	515521	Zingary	953	" Death ! "
515648	515665	515645	515646	Margaret Flathers	1291	" oh , no — you would not , could not murder me in cold blood ! "
515666	515669	515521	515521	Zingary	953	" Death , "
515672	515690	515645	515646	Margaret Flathers	1291	Zingary;—"death in the usual manner , according to the laws which this Tribunal was instituted to dispense . "
515691	515694	515697	515699	the unhappy woman	12130	" Death ! "
515707	515807	515697	515699	the unhappy woman	12130	" no — it is impossible ! You will not kill me — you can not cut me off so soon ! I am not prepared to die — I have led a wicked life , and must have time to repent . Spare me ! But — do not keep me in this dreadful suspense ! Oh ! I can understand that you wish to strike me with terror — to read me a terrible lesson . Well — you have succeeded ! Expel me from your society — thrust me out of your house ; but — — "
515808	515812	515814	515814	Zingary	953	" Remove her , "
515863	515872	515874	515874	Skilligalee	1337	" When is the sentence to be executed ? "
515883	515888	515890	515891	the king	3366	" Within the hour , "
515893	515905	515906	515906	Skilligalee	1337	" You may converse with her up to the fatal moment . "
515914	515922	515924	515924	Zingary	953	" Let the Traveller be now introduced , "
515968	515987	515989	515990	the king	3366	" You have conducted yourself in a manner calculated to involve us all in a most serious difficulty , "
515996	516059	515989	515990	the king	3366	" and we are compelled to rid ourselves of your presence without delay . You have been treated with hospitality by us : reward us by maintaining the most profound secresy relative to all you have seen or heard since you have been our companion and guest . Depart — and may you always be ready and willing to serve a Zingaree . "
516060	516067	516069	516069	Jem	873	" I will — I will , "
516071	516149	516069	516069	Jem	873	" night and day — in any case — I will risk my life for one of you . I do not blame you for expelling me ; in fact , I should have left you in the morning of my own accord . London is no place for an escaped convict ; and I shall not be sorry to leave it . But , answer me one question before I go : is that man dead ? "
516150	516161	516163	516163	Zingary	953	" We shall give you no information on that head , "
516165	516189	516190	516191	Crankey Jem	873	" Depart , my friend — and trouble us with your presence no longer . You have gold — and may you prosper . "
516415	516421	516423	516424	the king	3366	" Is every thing ready ? "
516426	516430	516423	516424	the king	3366	" Every thing , "
516472	516475	516477	516478	the king	3366	" Margaret , "
516485	516506	516477	516478	the king	3366	" your doom is prepared . Brethren , take warning against treachery and ingratitude from this last act of justice ! "

517934	517964	517899	517899	Richard	874	" It was . I knew him at once — I could not be mistaken : his voice , laden with a curse , still rings in my ears . "
517965	517983	517985	517986	the constable	2911	" Well , since the gentleman 's so positive , I ' spose it must be so , "
517988	518067	517985	517986	the constable	2911	" we musn't sleep upon it , mates . Ten to one that Tidkins has taken to burrow in one of the low cribs about here ; and he means to lie quiet for two or three days till the alarm 's blown over . I know the dodges of these fellers . You two go the round of Plumptre Street ; and me and this gentleman will just take a promiscuous look into the kens about here . "
518105	518121	518123	518124	the policeman	27346	" We 'll go first to Rats ' Castle , sir , if you please , "
518126	518145	518123	518124	the policeman	27346	" that is the most likely place for a run - away to take refuge in at random . "
518146	518153	518155	518155	Markham	874	" What is Rats ' Castle ? "
518189	518206	518123	518124	the policeman	27346	" The night - house where all kind of low people meet to sup and lodge , "
518211	518228	518123	518124	the policeman	27346	" But here we are — and you 'll see all about it in an instant . "
518294	518307	518309	518310	the policeman	27346	" You knock at the door , sir , if you please , "
518312	518354	518309	518310	the policeman	27346	" while I stand aside . I 'll slip in after you ; for if they twig my coat , and Tidkins really happens to be there , they 'd give him the office to bolt before we could get in . "
518355	518360	518362	518362	Markham	874	" Well thought of , "
518364	518375	518362	518362	Markham	874	" But upon what plea am I to claim admittance ? "
518376	518394	518395	518396	The policeman	27346	" As a stranger , impelled by curiosity . You carry the silver key in your pocket . "
518421	518426	518415	518416	the visitor	28468	" Who 's here ? "
518427	518437	518439	518439	Richard	874	" No one that will do you any harm , "
518441	518470	518439	518439	Richard	874	" I am anxious to witness the interior of this establishment ; and here is half - a - crown for you if you can gratify my curiosity . "
518471	518479	518543	518543	he	2001	" That 's English , any how , "
518489	518494	518543	518543	he	2001	" Stop a minute . "
518524	518537	518539	518540	a man	2001	" Now then , my ben - cull — in with you , "
518604	518613	518615	518616	the constable	2911	" Now , no noise , old feller , "
518631	518642	518615	518616	the constable	2911	" our business is n't with any of your set . "
518643	518647	518615	518616	the constable	2911	" Wery good , "
518656	518670	518615	518616	the constable	2911	" you know best — it is n't for me to say nothink . "
518671	518677	518679	518680	the officer	2833	" Go first , sir , "
518684	518711	518679	518680	the officer	2833	" You seem to know him better than me , for I never saw him but once — and then only for a minute or two . "
518712	518716	518718	518718	Richard	874	" Which way ? "
518720	518737	518739	518740	the policeman	27346	" Straight on — and then down stairs . You keep behind us , old feller , "
518903	518906	518901	518901	housewives	36026	" thieves , "
519170	519176	519178	519178	Markham	874	" He is not here , "
519192	519212	519214	519215	the policeman	27346	" He may come : this is the most likely place in Saint Giles 's for him to visit , "
519217	519227	519214	519215	the policeman	27346	" We will wait half - an - hour . "
519300	519308	519270	519271	A waiter	14249	" Please to order anythink , gen'lemen ? "
519309	519319	519321	519322	the constable	2911	" Two glasses of brandy - and - water , "
519410	519414	519366	519367	those present	2716	" in their jackets "
519494	519500	519502	519502	Markham	874	" What a strange assembly , "
519507	519517	519502	519502	Markham	874	" Strange to you , sir — no doubt , "
519538	519758	519504	519505	the constable	2911	" That sturdy feller sitting at the head of the nearest table , with the great cudgel between his legs , is one of the class that do n't take the trouble to clothe themselves in rags , but trust to their insolence to extort alms from females walking alone in retired parts . That feller next to him , all in tatters , but who laughs louder than any one else , is one of them whining , shivering , snivelling wretches that crouch up in doorways on rainy days , and on fine ones sit down on the pavement with ' Starving , but dare not beg , ' chalked on the stone before them . The man over there in sailor 's clothes tumbled down an area when he was drunk , and broke his leg : he was obliged to have it cut off ; and so he now passes himself off as one of Nelson 's own tars , though he never saw the sea in his life . That chap almost naked who 's just come in , is going to put on his coat and shoes before he sits down to supper ; he always goes out begging in that state on rainy days , and is a gentleman on fine ones . "
519759	519766	519768	519768	Markham	874	" I do not understand you , "
519776	519781	519783	519784	the policeman	27346	" Why , sir , "
519786	519978	519783	519784	the policeman	27346	" there 's certain beggars that always turn out half - naked , on rainy days , or when the snow 's on the ground ; and people pity them so much on those occasions that the rogues get enough to keep them all through the fine weather . If they have wives and children to go out with them , so much the better : but that feller there is n't married ; and so he goes with a woman who frequents this place , and they hire three or four children from the poor people in this neighbourhood , at the rate of two - pence a day each child , and its grub . To see them go shivering and whining through the streets , with no shoes or stockings , you 'd think they were the most miserable devils on the face of the earth ; and then , to make the scene complete , the man and woman always pinch the little children that they carry in their arms , to make them cry , whenever they pass a window when several ladies are looking out . "
519979	519984	519986	519986	Markham	874	" Is this possible ? "
519994	520100	519986	519986	Markham	874	" Possible , sir ! Do n't I see it all every day of my life ? Look at them men and women blowing their hides out with all that good meat ; and now look at the pots of porter that 's coming in . Every soul there has sworn a hundred times during the day that he has n't tasted food for forty - eight hours , and will repeat the same story to - morrow . But they all had good suppers here last night , and good breakfasts here this morning ; and you see how they are faring this evening . "
520101	520111	520113	520113	Markham	874	" But there are real cases deserving of charity ? "
520125	520132	519986	519986	Markham	874	" Certainly there are , sir , "
520137	520196	519986	519986	Markham	874	" but it 's very difficult for such as you to decide between the true and the false . Look at that man who carves at the second table : he can see well enough to cut himself the tit - bits ; but to - morrow he will be totally blind in one of the fashionable squares . "
520197	520201	520203	520203	Richard	874	" Totally blind ! "
520214	520286	520203	520203	Richard	874	" Yes , sir — totally blind ; led by a dog , and with a placard upon his chest . He keeps his eyes fast shut , and colours the lids with carmine and vermilion . But that is nothing . That feller next to him , who uses his knife and fork so well , will to - morrow have lost his right arm at the battle of Salamanca . "
520287	520296	519986	519986	Markham	874	" But how can that imposture be effected ? "
520297	520316	520318	520319	the constable	2911	" His right arm is concealed under his clothes , and the coat - sleeve hangs down loose , "
520321	520501	520318	520319	the constable	2911	" That tall stout man who has just jumped so nimbly over the form in his way back to his place , has walked on crutches in the streets for the last twenty years ; and when you see him so , you would think he could hardly drag himself along . The feller over there is a frozen - out gardener in winter , and a poor Spitalfields ' weaver in summer . The one next to him will have a black patch over his left eye to - morrow ; and yet you may see that it is as good as his right . The short man opposite to him bends his left leg back , and has a wooden one to support the knee , when he is in the street . That woman there has been dressed in widows ' weeds for the last fifteen years , and always has a troop of six children with her ; but the children never grow any bigger , for she hires fresh ones every year or so . "
520502	520519	520521	520521	Markham	874	" This is the most extraordinarily combined mass of contradictions and deceptions I ever gazed upon , "
520523	520532	520534	520535	the policeman	27346	" You may well say that , sir , "
520537	520960	520534	520535	the policeman	27346	" The ragged feller down at the bottom of the second table sits as upright as you or me : well , in the streets he crawls along the ground with two iron supporters in his hands . He is the most insolent feller in London . The man next to him goes about on a sort of van , or chaise , and the world believes that he has no legs at all ; but they are all the time concealed in the body of the vehicle , and the stumps of the thighs which are seen are false . Those three hulking chaps over there , sitting with the three women that laugh so much , are begging - letter impostors . The eldest of the three men has been seventeen years at the business , and has been in prison twenty - eight times . One day he is a bricklayer who has fallen from a scaffold , and broken his leg , and has a wife and eleven young children dependent on him ; another day he is a licensed clergyman of the Church of England , but unemployed for two years — wife and six children totally dependent on him . Then he changes into a stanch Tory , ruined by his attachment to the cause , and proscribed by all his friends on account of his principles : in this shape he addresses himself to the old Tory noblemen , and makes a good harvest . The very next day he becomes a determined and stanch Reformer , who lost his employment through giving his vote for the Tower Hamlets to the liberal candidate at the last election , and has since met with an uninterrupted series of misfortunes — sold up by a Tory landlord,—his wife been dead only a fortnight , and seven motherless children left dependent on him . This kind of letter always draws well . Then he becomes a paralytic with an execution in his house ; or a Spitalfields ' weaver , with nine children , two of which are cripples , and one blind ; or else a poor Scotch schoolmaster , come to London on business , and robbed by designing knaves of the means of returning to his own country . The women are just as bad . They are either wives with husbands in hospitals and bed - ridden mothers ; or daughters with helpless parents and sick brothers and sisters dependent on them;—and so on . "
520961	520983	520985	520985	Markham	874	" But if you be aware of all these monstrous impositions , why do you not interfere to protect the public ? "
520987	520992	520994	520995	the constable	2911	" Lord , sir ! "
520997	521069	520994	520995	the constable	2911	" if we took up all persons that we know to be impostors , we should have half London in custody . We only interfere when specially called upon , or when we see cases so very flagrant that we ca n't help taking notice of them . Some of these chaps that are eating here so hearty now , will seem to be dying in the streets to - morrow . "
521070	521084	521086	521086	Richard	874	" Merciful heavens , what a city of deceit and imposture is this ! "
521100	521132	521086	521086	Richard	874	" Were the interior of this den but once exposed to general view , charity would be at an end , and the deserving poor would suffer for the unprincipled impostor . "
521133	521212	521213	521213	Markham	874	" True enough , sir . And now look — the cloth is removed , and every one is ordering in something strong to wash down the supper . There goes a crown - bowl of punch — that 's for the begging - letter impostors : and there 's glasses of punch , and cold spirits and water , and shrub , and negus . That 's the way they do it , you see , sir . "
521252	521264	521265	521265	he	874	" The person whom we seek does not appear to come , "
521275	521289	521265	521265	he	874	" Two hours have elapsed — and we are only wasting time here . "
521290	521303	521305	521306	the constable	2911	" He must have taken refuge in some other crib , sir , "
521308	521329	521330	521330	Markham	874	" Let us leave this one , and make the round of the other lodging - houses in this street . "
521794	521806	521786	521787	The pawnbroker	1903	" Whilst thy dominion lasts , I am sure to thrive . "
521853	521861	521848	521848	he	32765	" Thou art the Angel of Death . "
522147	522158	522160	522161	the policeman	27346	" Unless my mates have been more lucky than us , "
522171	522181	522160	522161	the policeman	27346	" we must conclude that the bird is flown . "
522182	522209	522211	522211	Richard	874	" And even if they should chance to enter a house where the miscreant has taken refuge , how would they be enabled to recognise him ? "
522213	522221	522223	522224	the constable	2911	" One of them knows him well , "
522354	522366	522336	522337	The constable	2911	" Ah ! there 's Smithers at his old tricks again . "
522367	522373	522375	522375	Richard	874	" And who is Smithers ? "
522410	522422	522424	522424	Markham	874	" Had we not bettor ascertain what is the matter here ? "
522428	522446	522448	522449	the officer	2833	" I dare not force an entry , unless there 's a cry of ' Murder , ' "
522492	522495	522424	522424	Markham	874	" Murder ! "
522593	522598	522600	522601	the policeman	27346	" Now , Gibbet , "
522622	522629	522600	522601	the policeman	27346	" what 's all this about ? "
522630	522638	522640	522643	the hump - back	14348	" Oh ! you are an officer ! "
522653	522666	522640	522643	the hump - back	14348	" for God 's sake come up — father 's murdering Kate ! "
523292	523298	523284	523296	the agent of an imagination that loved to " sup full of horrors	39002	" sup full of horrors , "
523798	523816	523792	523792	herself	7718	" For God 's sake protect me — but do not , do not hurt my uncle ! "
523997	524005	524007	524009	the young girl	30983	" For God 's sake protect me ! "
524015	524026	524027	524027	she	30983	" but do not — do not hurt my uncle , "
524040	524048	524050	524051	the constable	2911	" Come , come , Master Smithers , "
524053	524068	524050	524051	the constable	2911	" this wo n't do : you musn't alarm the neighbourhood in this manner . "
524069	524082	524084	524085	the man	2092	" Why , then , does she interfere between me and Gibbet ? "
524102	524115	524117	524118	the constable	2911	" She does it out of good - nature , I suppose , "
524120	524142	524117	524118	the constable	2911	" Every one knows how shameful you treat your son Gibbet ; and this poor gal takes her cousin 's part . "
524176	524189	524191	524192	the man	2092	" She does it out of good - nature , does she ? "
524194	524262	524191	524192	the man	2092	" then why wo n't he learn my business ? He never can be fit for any other . But , no — the moment I leave him , he is off to the side of Miss there ; and she makes him read in her outlandish books , so that he despises his father and the business that he must take to , sooner or later . "
524263	524275	524277	524278	the policeman	27346	" But you ought not to beat Miss Katherine , Smithers , "
524280	524311	524191	524192	the man	2092	" The next time I hear the cry of ' Murder ' in your house I 'll walk you off to the station — and that 's all about it . "
524312	524326	524328	524329	the man	2092	" I suppose that I may leather my own son if I choose ? "
524333	524346	524348	524349	the constable	2911	" You ought to remember that he is deformed through your cruelty , "
524351	524363	524348	524349	the constable	2911	" and that his mother died of fright and grief — — "
524364	524373	524377	524377	his	1405	" Hold your tongue , blue - bottle ! "
524383	524403	524377	524377	his	1405	" It is n't for you to come and make mischief in a family . Get out with you ! "
524404	524419	524421	524421	Markham	874	" But if we leave this poor girl to the rage of her uncle , "
524437	524445	524421	524421	Markham	874	" he will do her some injury . "
524446	524457	524459	524460	the officer	2833	" What is to be done with her , sir ? "
524462	524471	524459	524460	the officer	2833	" Smithers says she is his niece — — "
524472	524489	524491	524504	our hero , whose humane heart was moved in favour of the suffering girl	14414	" Is it not certain that she stands in such a degree of relationship towards him ? "
524506	524518	524520	524520	Smithers	1405	" Now , then , what are you chattering about there ? "
524522	524571	524520	524520	Smithers	1405	" I want to go to bed : Gibbet , you be off to your room — and , Kate , you go to yours . This is mine — and I should advise the blue - bottle with his spy in plain clothes to make themselves scarce . "
524572	524583	524585	524586	the policeman	27346	" Remember , I shall report you to our serjeant , "
524588	524602	524585	524586	the policeman	27346	" and he will tell the Division to keep an eye on you . "
524603	524610	524612	524613	the man	2092	" Tell him whatever you like , "
524677	524683	524674	524674	his	5194	" Who is that man ? "
524684	524689	524653	524653	his	2911	" The Public Executioner , "
524714	524724	524726	524727	the policeman	27346	" I see that you are surprised , sir , "
524729	524752	524726	524727	the policeman	27346	" but could n't you guess where you was when you saw the room filled with gibbets , real or in pictures ? "
524753	524768	524770	524770	Richard	874	" It never struck me who the owner of those terrific symbols might be , "
524772	524803	524770	524770	Richard	874	" I concluded that some man of morbid taste dwelt there ; but not for one moment did I imagine that I was in the presence of the public executioner . "
524804	524820	524822	524823	the policeman	27346	" Did you ever see such a horrible - looking object as his son is ? "
524825	524855	524822	524823	the policeman	27346	" Poor creature — he is greatly to be pitied ! Surely his father can not in reality have conferred upon him the name by which you called him ? "
524856	525009	524770	524770	Richard	874	" I do n't suppose that Gibbet is his real name , sir , but it is the only one I ever heard him called by . You see , sir , Smithers wishes to bring the lad up to the same line : he wants an assistant , and he thinks that Gibbet is old enough to help him . Besides , there 's plenty of work always after Assizes in the country ; and the London hangman may get the jobs if he likes . He 's considered more skilful than any one else ; and , after all , practice makes perfect . As it is , he is forced to refuse a good many offers , because he ca n't be here , there , and everywhere . Now if Gibbet would only take to the business kindly , he might help his father to earn a fortune ! "
525010	525029	525031	525031	Markham	874	" But if the poor lad have a loathing for the horrible avocation — as well he may , "
525037	525047	525031	525031	Markham	874	" why should he be forced to embrace it ? "
525048	525058	525060	525061	the constable	2911	" Because he can never do himself good elsewhere , "
525063	525120	525060	525061	the constable	2911	" Who will employ the son of Jack Ketch ? Why , will you believe it , sir , that not a soul visits Smithers ' family ? Although he lives in this neighbourhood , where , God knows , people ai n't over nice and partickler , not a human being would cross his threshold . "
525121	525131	525133	525133	Markham	874	" Does that aversion arise from disgust or superstition ? "
525135	525141	525133	525133	Markham	874	" From both , sir , "
525146	525233	525133	525133	Markham	874	" The people that live in this district are of two kinds — the poor and ignorant , and the rogues and vagabonds . The poor and ignorant are afraid of the public executioner ; and the rogues and vagabonds hate him , although he 's merely an instrument . Miss Kate goes to market for him ; and the shop - keepers that know who she is , are scarcely civil to her . They seem as if they 'd rather she 'd keep away . "
525234	525246	525248	525248	Markham	874	" And you say that she is the executioner 's niece ? "
525250	525256	525248	525248	Markham	874	" Smithers says so himself , "
525261	525296	525248	525248	Markham	874	" and of course I know nothing to the contrary ; but it does seem strange that so amiable , genteel , and clever , a young gal should belong to such a family ! "
525297	525307	525133	525133	Markham	874	" Her own parents are dead , I presume ? "
525308	525469	525133	525133	Markham	874	" Yes , sir,—she is an orphan . When Smithers is very dull and miserable with his lonely situation , he sometimes comes down to the station and has a chat with us constables ; and then he 's pretty communicative . He told me one day that Katherine 's parents had died when she was very young , and so he was compelled to take care of her . All the while she was a child Smithers let her do pretty well as she liked ; and it is a wonder that she has turned out a good gal . But she regularly frequented the School established in the parish of Saint David 's by the Rev. Mr. Tracy ; and in that way she picked up a tolerable smattering of knowledge . Since then she 's instructed herself as much as she could , and has bought books with the little money that her needle has produced her . "
525470	525500	525502	525502	Richard	874	" But who employs her as a sempstress , if , as you say , so terrible a stigma affixes itself to each member of the hangman 's family ? "
525504	525526	525528	525529	the policeman	27346	" The old housekeeper at Mr. Tracy 's is very friendly disposed towards the poor creature , and gives her work , "
525531	525568	525528	525529	the policeman	27346	" Katherine does all she can to console that poor hump - back Gibbet ; and she has taught him to read and write — aye , and what 's more , sir , to pray . "
525569	525572	525574	525574	Richard	874	" Policeman , "
525580	525653	525574	525574	Richard	874	" the manner in which you have spoken relative to that poor girl , shows me that you have a good heart . Is there any mode of ameliorating her wretched situation ? I feel the deepest compassion for her miserable lot ; and all you have told me of her excellent character makes me anxious to see her removed from the vile society of that ruffian under whose roof she lives . "
525654	525674	525676	525677	the constable	2911	" I believe she is anxious to go out to service , sir , or open a little school , "
525679	525703	525676	525677	the constable	2911	" but her family connection is against her . Or else I do n't think that Smithers would care about parting with her . "
525704	525716	525718	525718	Markham	874	" What induces you to suppose that such are her wishes ? "
525720	525729	525718	525718	Markham	874	" Because she told me so , sir , "
525734	525764	525718	525718	Markham	874	" One evening I went to Smithers ' house , with a certain message from the Sheriff of London — you can guess what , I dare say — — "
525765	525782	525574	525574	Richard	874	" To acquaint him with the day fixed for some wretch 's execution , no doubt ? "
525783	525962	525986	525987	the policeman	27346	" Precisely , sir ; but Smithers was n't at home , and so I sate down and waited for him . It was n't in Jack Ketch 's own room up stairs where we went just now , and where he teaches his son how to hang by means of that puppet ; but it was in a little parlour they have got down stairs , and which Miss Kate keeps as clean and comfortable as if they saw no end of company . Well , I got talking to the young gal ; and though she never said a single word against her uncle , but spoke of him in a grateful and kind manner , she let out that if he could spare her , she should like to earn her own bread by her own exertions . And then the poor creature burst out crying , and said , that no one would take her as a servant , and that she should get no scholars even if she was to open a school . "
525980	525984	525986	525987	the policeman	27346	" Poor gal ! "
525996	526261	525986	525987	the policeman	27346	" she do n't deserve to suffer as she does . My beat is about this quarter : and I know pretty well all that 's going on . I see more than other people about here , because I 've opportunity and leisure . Besides , it 's my business . Well , sir , I can assure you that there is n't a more charitable or generous - hearted gal in all London than Miss Katherine . If a poor neighbour 's ill , it 's ten to one but some female muffled up in her shawl knocks at the door of the sick person 's house , leaves a parcel , and runs away ; and then there 's tea , and sugar , and gruel , for the invalid — and no one knows who brought it , or where it comes from . Or if a family 's in want , the baker calls with bread that 's paid for , but wo n't say who sent it . Or may be it 's the butcher with a small joint — but always sent in the same quiet manner . Then , while the poor creatures whose hearts are made glad by this unlooked - for charity , are wondering whether it was the parson , or the parson 's wife , or this benevolent gentleman , or that good lady , who sent the things , Kate buries herself in her room , and does n't even think that she has done any thing out of the way . "
526262	526267	526269	526269	Markham	874	" Is this possible ? "
526271	526287	526289	526290	the policeman	27346	" I know it , sir — for I 've seen her do it all , "
526292	526308	526289	526290	the policeman	27346	" when she could n't see me and little thought that any body noticed her . "
526309	526319	526321	526321	Richard	874	" And she the niece of the public executioner ! "
526323	526332	526321	526321	Richard	874	" a pearl concealed in this horrible swamp ! "
526368	526374	526376	526376	Richard	874	" Well , what news ? "
526380	526383	526376	526376	Richard	874	" None , "
526388	526412	526376	526376	Richard	874	" We have been in every flash crib down yonder , and ca n't hear or see any thing of the Resurrection Man . "
526413	526428	526430	526430	Richard	874	" Then we must abandon the search for to - night , I presume , "
526432	526450	526430	526430	Richard	874	" The clock has struck one , and I begin to be wearied of this fruitless ramble . "
526451	526469	526471	526481	the constable who had been our hero 's companion that night	14438	" We will exert ourselves to discover the miscreant that blew up our comrades in Bethnal Green , "
526483	526504	526430	526430	Richard	874	" Should we succeed in capturing him , sir , where can I wait upon you to communicate the tidings ? "
526505	526511	526471	526481	the constable who had been our hero 's companion that night	14438	" My name is Markham , "
526516	526543	526471	526481	the constable who had been our hero 's companion that night	14438	" and I live at Holloway . If you discover the villain Anthony Tidkins , lose not a moment in making me acquainted with the circumstance . "
526576	526581	526582	526582	he	874	" My good fellow , "
526593	526621	526582	526582	he	874	" you have too kind a heart for the situation which you fill . Should you ever require a friend , hesitate not to come to me . "
526622	526659	526660	526660	Markham	874	" And should you , sir , ever need the humble aid of Morris Benstead , you know the Division I belong to , and a note to the chief station will always command my attention . "
526732	526740	526742	526743	the man	2092	" I beg your pardon , sir , "
526745	526763	526742	526743	the man	2092	" but I heard you mention two names a few moments ago that are familiar to me . "
526764	526767	526769	526770	our hero	5194	" Indeed ! "
526780	526800	526802	526803	the man	2092	" Yes:—I was lurking in a court , and I heard you say that you were Mr. Richard Markham , "
526805	526814	526802	526803	the man	2092	" and you mentioned a certain Anthony Tidkins . "
526815	526824	526826	526826	Richard	874	" I did . Do you know him ? "
526828	526833	526835	526836	the man	2092	" But too well , "
526839	526844	526846	526846	Markham	874	" Who are you ? "
526848	526920	526846	526846	Markham	874	" No matter who I am : I know you — and I know him . I was in a certain place at the same time that you were there ; though we were not in the same ward . But I heard all about you then ; and when you mentioned your name just now , I felt sure you was the same person . Has Tidkins ever injured you ? "
526921	526924	526926	526926	Richard	874	" Cruelly , "
526928	526953	526926	526926	Richard	874	" But I am not influenced by petty motives of revenge : I am anxious to deliver a monster into the grasp of justice . "
526954	526973	526846	526846	Markham	874	" And what should you say if you heard that Tidkins was beyond your reach in this world ? "
526974	526987	526926	526926	Richard	874	" I should rejoice that society was relieved from such a fiend . "
526988	527003	527005	527006	the man	2092	" Then I think that I can make your mind easy on that score , "
527008	527014	527016	527016	Richard	874	" What do you mean ? "
527020	527033	527035	527036	the stranger	2298	" I mean that this hand has done the law 's work , "
527038	527055	527057	527057	Markham	874	" You mean — you mean that you yourself have acted the part of an avenger ? "
527059	527075	527057	527057	Markham	874	" Precisely what I do mean : in plain terms , I 've killed him . "
527076	527088	527090	527090	Richard	874	" My God ! and you tell me this so coolly ! "
527092	527109	527090	527090	Richard	874	" Whatever that man 's crimes may be , you are not the less a murderer ! "
527110	527145	527057	527057	Markham	874	" Pooh — pooh ! I should have thought you 'd more pluck than to talk in this way . What does it matter whether Jack Ketch or a private enemy did the job ? "
527146	527156	527158	527158	Markham	874	" Where did this happen ? when?—how long ago ? "
527176	527187	527189	527190	the man	2092	" If you really wish to know all about it , "
527192	527236	527189	527190	the man	2092	" step up this court , where we can talk in peace , and I will tell you . What ! you think I am going to hurt you too ? Well , be it so . Goodnight — or rather good morning . "
527247	527250	527252	527252	Richard	874	" Stay , "
527261	527267	527252	527252	Richard	874	" I will accompany you . "
527318	527325	527315	527315	he	2092	" Can you keep a secret ? "
527326	527334	527336	527336	Richard	874	" If I promise to do so , "
527338	527352	527315	527315	he	2092	" Then promise not to betray what I am going to tell you . "
527353	527357	527359	527359	Markham	874	" I promise , "
527365	527370	527372	527373	the man	2092	" You must know , "
527380	527418	527372	527373	the man	2092	" that I have lately partaken of the hospitality of a race of persons , at whose head - quarters — not a hundred miles from where we are now standing — I met Anthony Tidkins — — "
527419	527422	527424	527424	Richard	874	" When ? "
527427	527433	527424	527424	Richard	874	" About two hours ago . "
527434	527444	527372	527373	the man	2092	" Ah ! then it may be true — — "
527445	527482	527484	527484	he	2092	" True ! what interest have I to tell you a lie ? I have been some time in search of that villain ; and accident threw us together to - night . This dagger — — "
527499	527508	527484	527484	he	2092	poniard,—"this dagger drank his life 's best blood ! "
527522	527526	527518	527519	The assassin	28556	" Unhappy man , "
527531	527548	527518	527519	The assassin	28556	" are you not aware that your life may be forfeited on account of this deed ? "
527549	527567	527518	527519	The assassin	28556	" And this good blade should reach the heart of any one that attempted to take me , "
527576	527596	527598	527598	Markham	874	" I promised to betray nothing that you might communicate to me , and I shall keep my word , "
527612	527628	527598	527598	Markham	874	" Did I wish to forfeit my pledge , your dagger would not intimidate me . "
527629	527636	527638	527639	the stranger	2298	" You are a brave fellow , "
527641	527671	527638	527639	the stranger	2298	" and all brave men may be trusted . Would you like to satisfy yourself , with your own eyes , that Anthony Tidkins has received his death wound ? "
527672	527676	527678	527678	Markham	874	" I should , "
527680	527692	527678	527678	Markham	874	" both on my own account and on that of society . "
527693	527717	527638	527639	the stranger	2298	" And you will not betray the place that I shall take you to , or the people that you may see there ? "
527718	527727	527638	527639	the stranger	2298	" Most solemnly will I keep your secret . "
527728	527772	527678	527678	Markham	874	" Come with me , then . I will leave you at the door ; and your own ingenuity must obtain you admittance . But , one word more : you will not state to any one there that you have met me ? "
527773	527791	527638	527639	the stranger	2298	" I will not even allow my motive for visiting the place you speak of to transpire . "
527792	527801	527802	527803	The man	2092	" I believe all you say . Come ! "
527837	527854	527678	527678	Markham	874	" Knock , and demand shelter : admittance will not , I fancy , be refused . "
527855	527864	527866	527866	Markham	874	" Is there any danger to be encountered ? "
527868	527880	527866	527866	Markham	874	" not that I fear it — but I am unarmed . "
527881	527918	527678	527678	Markham	874	" There is no danger . This is the head - quarters of the Gipsies , or Zingarees : they never use the dagger or the pistol . And , once more , remember your promise . "
527919	527926	527928	527928	Richard	874	" I shall not forget it , "
527930	527942	527928	527928	Richard	874	" But , before we separate , answer me one question . "
527943	527950	527952	527953	the man	2092	" Speak — and be speedy , "
527955	527992	527952	527953	the man	2092	" In one word , then , why , when you overheard my conversation with the policeman , did you resolve upon making me the confidant of a deed which might send you to the scaffold ? "
527993	528002	528004	528005	the man	2092	" Because I am proud of that deed , "
528020	528072	528004	528005	the man	2092	triumph;—"because it is the result of four years of pent - up yearning after vengeance;—because , in avenging myself , I have avenged all who have suffered through that miscreant;—because I am anxious that those who have been injured by him should know the fate that has overtaken him at last . "
528361	528366	528372	528373	the porter	2789	" Who are you ? "
528375	528386	528388	528388	Markham	874	" I seek a few hours ' repose and rest , "
528390	528396	528388	528388	Markham	874	" Who sent you here ? "
528397	528407	528372	528373	the porter	2789	" A person who is a friend to you . "
528408	528417	528372	528373	the porter	2789	" Do you know what place this is ? "
528418	528431	528388	528388	Markham	874	" Yes — it is the head - quarters of the Zingarees . "
528432	528439	528441	528442	the porter	2789	" So far , so good , "
528444	528456	528441	528442	the porter	2789	" Well — wait a few moments — I must see . "
528510	528515	528516	528516	he	2789	" You may enter , "
528519	528532	528516	528516	he	2789	" The Zingarees never refuse hospitality when it can be safely granted . "
528549	528553	528555	528556	the man	2092	" Follow me , "
528589	528598	528600	528601	the porter	2789	" You have your choice of the downies , "
528608	528623	528600	528601	the porter	2789	" and I shall leave you this light . Do you require any food ? "
528624	528631	528645	528645	he	2092	" None , I thank you . "
528632	528638	528640	528641	the man	2092	" So I should think , "
528951	528964	528965	528965	he	874	" How weak I am to yield to this sentiment of fear ! "
528968	528977	528965	528965	he	874	" Rather let me determine how to act . "
529480	529485	529487	529487	Markham	874	" Time wears on , "
529490	529526	529487	529487	Markham	874	" and no opportunity of satisfying myself upon the one point seems to present itself . To attempt to seek repose is impossible ; to pass the dull hours in suspense like this is intolerable ! "
529575	529601	529602	529602	he	874	" The hour for departure will come , and I shall leave this house as full of doubt and uncertainty as when I entered it ! "
529707	529722	529723	529723	he	874	" With the assurance of light for another half hour , and good courage , "
529728	529736	529723	529723	he	874	" I may yet accomplish my purpose . "
529920	529922	529875	529879	the inmates of the house	12909	" Anthony Tidkins!"—but
530066	530087	530088	530088	Richard	874	" Come to me to - night without fail , between eleven and twelve . Knock in the usual manner . "
530180	530183	530187	530187	himself	874	" Oh ! "
530189	530228	530187	530187	himself	874	" if my unhappy brother have really been the victim , the associate , or the employer of that incarnate demon , may God grant that the wretch is indeed no more — for the sake of Eugene ! "
530249	530255	530259	530259	himself	874	" It must be so ! "
530261	530306	530259	530259	himself	874	" that stranger has not deceived me:—the presence of this pocket - book here is an undeniable trace of the miscreant . Oh , how much it now behoves me to convince myself that he is indeed removed from the theatre of his crimes ! "
530834	530846	530848	530848	Markham	874	" No — that self - accuser has not deceived me ! "
530856	530883	530884	530884	He	874	" All circumstances combine to bear evidence to the truth of his assertion ! Doubtless the gipsies have departed , carrying away the corpse with them ! "
530947	531026	530945	530945	he	874	himself—"Am I certain that he is no more ? That lint to stanch the blood — those bandages to bind the wound,—do they not rather bear testimony to a blow which was not fatal , but left life behind it ? And yet , for what purpose could the body be removed — save for secret interment ? Oh ! if that man be yet alive — and if Eugene be indeed his accomplice or his patron — — "
531072	531078	531080	531080	Richard	874	" But , after all , "
531094	531219	531080	531080	Richard	874	mind,—"after all , ought I not to rejoice , if this man be indeed still alive , that he has survived the assassin 's blow — that he is allowed leisure for repentance ! My Maker , who can read all hearts , knows that I am not selfish ; and yet it is a principle of our frail human nature to rejoice at the fall of a deadly enemy ! Oh ! when I think of all the wrongs and injuries I have experienced at the hands of that man,—exposures — persecutions — attempts upon my life,—I can not pray that he may live to be the scourge of others — and perhaps of my brother — as he has been of me ! "
531623	531628	531615	531616	a man	2001	" Who is it ? "
531637	531649	531651	531651	Markham	874	" I will answer you when we are on equal terms , "
531668	531674	531675	531675	he	874	" Now — stand off , "
531678	531689	531675	531675	he	874	" for I am not to be injured with impunity . "
531690	531699	531701	531702	the man	2092	" I do n't want to injure you , "
531704	531723	531701	531702	the man	2092	" But who are you ? I know by your voice that you 're not one of us . "
531724	531734	531736	531736	Markham	874	" You then are an inmate of this house ? "
531756	531760	531762	531763	the man	2092	" She lives ! "
531798	531818	531788	531788	Richard	874	" She lives ? whom do you allude to ? Surely there can not be a female imprisoned — — "
531819	531829	531831	531832	the man	2092	" Be silent , in the name of heaven ! "
531838	531855	531831	531832	the man	2092	" The life of an unhappy woman depends upon your secrecy — whoever you may be . "
531856	531870	531872	531872	Markham	874	" Then would I rather aid than harm you and her , both , "
531899	531904	531906	531907	the man	2092	" This bolt,—this bolt ! "
531918	531925	531906	531907	the man	2092	" Oh ! for a light ! "
531926	531933	531935	531935	Richard	874	" Can you not procure one ? "
531937	531940	531942	531943	the man—"a	39205	" Stay , "
531943	531978	531979	531980	The man	2092	man—"a good thought ! There should be candles somewhere here — and matches . By Jove ! here is a candle — and , on this shelf — yes — here are matches also ! "
532000	532015	532017	532018	the man	2092	" Ah ! I thought so by your voice — you are a gentleman , "
532020	532028	532017	532018	the man	2092	" then you will not betray me ? "
532029	532033	532035	532035	Markham	874	" Betray you ! "
532042	532069	532070	532071	The man	2092	" I will tell you what I mean presently : there is no time to be lost ! Hark — another groan : she is dying ! "
532210	532230	532238	532238	he	14635	" Margaret — cheer up — it 's me — it 's Skilligalee — I'm come to save you , "
532243	532252	532254	532254	Markham	874	" How long has she been immured here ? "
532256	532263	532265	532265	Skilligalee	1337	" Only three or four hours , "
532267	532294	532295	532295	Markham	874	" and so it must be fright that has half killed her . Pray get some water , sir — there 's plenty in the scullery . "
532342	532350	532352	532353	the Rattlesnake	1292	" How long have I been here ? "
532375	532382	532384	532384	Skilligalee	1337	" Not many hours , Meg , "
532386	532397	532398	532398	she	14634	" And you will not leave me here any longer ? "
532401	532414	532398	532398	she	14634	" Oh ! do not let me die in this horrible place ! "
532415	532423	532425	532425	Skilligalee	1337	" I am come to save you , "
532427	532437	532425	532425	Skilligalee	1337	" Are you able to get up and walk ? "
532438	532447	532449	532450	the Rattlesnake	11700	" Yes — for the sake of freedom , "
532457	532463	532464	532464	she	14634	" But who is that ? "
532479	532490	532492	532492	Skilligalee	1337	" That 's exactly what I do n't know myself , "
532494	532536	532537	532537	Markham	874	" The gentleman has , however , behaved himself as such ; and that 's enough for us . Hark ! there 's the clock on the staircase striking five ? We have n't much time to lose : come on . "
532564	532571	532572	532572	she	14634	" Which way shall we go ? "
532592	532598	532600	532600	Skilligalee	1337	" By the back gate , "
532602	532619	532600	532600	Skilligalee	1337	" I have secured the key . The porter keeps the keys of the front door . "
532620	532640	532642	532643	the Rattlesnake	1292	" And what has become of him — that dreadful man who was the cause of all this misery ? "
532645	532662	532642	532643	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Was he killed by the blow that the Traveller dealt him with his long dagger ? "
532675	532687	532688	532688	he	14634	" Was any one wounded in this house during the night ? "
532716	532724	532726	532726	Richard	874	" Answer me , I conjure you , "
532736	532753	532726	532726	Richard	874	" I have every reason to believe that a person whose name is Anthony Tidkins — — "
532754	532761	532763	532764	the Rattlesnake	1292	" Oh ! yes — yes , "
532771	532779	532781	532781	Markham	874	" Then I have not been deceived ! "
532783	532812	532781	532781	Markham	874	" That individual , who is better known as the Resurrection Man , was dangerously wounded — if not killed — in this house a few hours since . "
532815	532824	532781	532781	Markham	874	" he continued , addressing himself to Skilligalee , "
532862	532863	532856	532856	you	1337	" "
532871	532875	532856	532856	you	1337	" said Skilligalee . "
532887	532888	532880	532880	I	0	" "
532935	532936	532909	532909	he	3220	" "
532946	532951	532943	532944	Mr. Markham	874	" interrupted be Rattlesnake . "
533012	533058	533075	533075	you	1337	" Here the Rattlesnake stopped , and leant heavily upon Skilligalee for support — so profoundly was she terrified at the mere possibility of Anthony Tidkins being still in existence . Her companion perceived her emotion , and fathoming its cause , hastened to exclaim , "
533072	533073	533065	533065	You	1337	" "
533085	533089	533079	533079	you	1337	" demanded Markham . "
533097	533102	533092	533092	him	14645	" was the answer . "
533110	533114	533092	533092	him	14645	" cried Richard . "
533117	533121	533092	533092	him	14645	" returned Skilligalee . "
533196	533197	533192	533193	the Traveller	7829	" "
533208	533212	533213	533214	The Traveller	7829	" demanded Richard . "
533216	533221	533213	533214	The Traveller	7829	" answered the Skilligalee . "
533249	533250	533239	533239	he	14645	" "
533257	533263	533251	533251	I	0	" said Richard , musing . "
533271	533272	533266	533266	I	0	" "
533333	533334	533337	533337	him	14645	" "
533339	533371	533337	533337	him	14645	" said Richard , instantaneously recalling to mind the groans which had met his ears when he was listening at his chamber door to the bustle of the gipsies ' departure . "
533376	533380	533374	533374	him	14645	" repeated Skilligalee . "
533394	533395	533396	533396	We	14663	" "
533471	533482	533468	533468	we	14663	" added Skilligalee , his voice assuming a peculiar tone , "
533490	533491	533492	533492	God	880	" "
533496	533512	533492	533492	God	880	" ejaculated the Rattlesnake , with a fervour which made Markham 's blood run cold . "
533526	533530	533516	533516	I	0	" said Skilligalee , "
533561	533599	533531	533531	you	14676	" Skilligalee uttered these words in his usually jocular manner ; for he was anxious to reassure his female companion , who still laboured under an excess of terror that seemed ready to prostrate all her energies . "
533609	533613	533531	533531	you	14676	" said Markham : "
533625	533676	533683	533683	you	14681	" Skilligalee now took the candle and led the way , still supporting Margaret Flathers on his arm . They all three effected their egress from the palace without any obstacle . When they were safe in the alley with which the back gate communicated , Markham said to Skilligalee , "
533705	533706	533683	533683	you	14681	" "
533714	533718	533719	533719	I	0	" answered Skilligalee . "
533738	533739	533719	533719	I	0	" "
533754	533758	533719	533719	I	0	" said Richard : "
533769	533770	533775	533775	sir	26649	" "
533780	533784	533775	533775	sir	26649	" returned Skilligalee . "
533794	533872	533775	533775	sir	26649	" Markham vainly pressed his offer : it was declined with many expressions of gratitude . The truth was that Skilligalee had the greater portion of his share of Margaret 's gold still remaining ; and there was something so generous and so noble in the manner of Richard Markham , that he could not find it in his heart to impose upon him by taking a sum of which he did not stand in immediate need . "
533896	533900	533878	533878	me	0	" observed Richard , "
533915	533916	533917	533917	I	0	" "
533926	533930	533917	533917	I	0	" returned Skilligalee ; "
533939	533940	533933	533933	God	880	" "
533944	533954	533942	533942	you	14681	" continued Richard , addressing himself to Margaret Flathers , "
534015	534016	534018	534018	God	880	" "
534029	534078	534018	534018	God	880	" said Margaret Flathers , weeping . She had not merely repeated , with parrot - like callousness , the words uttered by her companion : that benediction emanated with fervid sincerity from a heart deeply penetrated by anxiety to renew a long - forgotten acquaintance with rectitude . "
534083	534210	534081	534081	sir	26649	" said Skilligalee . He and the Rattlesnake then struck into one of the streets with which the alley at the back of the gipsies ' palace communicated . Richard took another direction on his way homewards . A fortnight had passed since the incidents just related . It was a Monday morning . The clock of St. Giles 's had just struck six , when the faint , flickering gleam of a candle struggled through the uppermost windows of the hangman 's house . The few persons who were passing along at that hour , and on that dark winter 's morning , shuddered as they caught a glimpse of the sickly glare through the obscurity and the mist — for they thought within themselves , "
534230	534267	534270	534270	you	14701	" And such was indeed the case . Smithers rose shortly before six ; and , having lighted the solitary candle that stood upon the mantel , proceeded to the floor below to call his son . "
534274	534293	534270	534270	you	14701	" he cried , thundering with his fist at the door of the hump - back 's room ; "
534297	534298	534270	534270	you	14701	" "
534306	534318	534304	534304	father	3167	" replied the lad , from the interior of the chamber . "
534326	534510	534304	534304	father	3167	" said the executioner in a savage tone . He then returned to the loft . There was something horribly fantastic in the appearance of that place . The dim and sickly light of the candle did but little more than redeem from complete obscurity the various strange objects which we have already described . But as the penetrating eye of the executioner plunged into the visible darkness of the loft , and beheld the ominous figure balancing beneath the beam , while its mask of a livid white hue wore a ghastly appearance in contrast with the black body and limbs which it surmounted,—no sentiment of horror nor of alarm agitated his heart . The avocations of the man had brutalized him , and blunted every humane feeling which he had once possessed . He walked up and down the room impatiently for several minutes , until the door opened and his son entered . The hideous countenance of the lad was ghastly pale , and distorted with horror . His eyes glared fearfully , as if terrific apparitions flitted before them . "
534513	534518	534304	534304	father	3167	" said his father , "
534535	534536	534522	534522	your	14703	" "
534540	534555	534522	534522	your	14703	" repeated the lad , his teeth chattering , and his knees knocking together . "
534569	534574	534562	534562	I	0	" cried the executioner . "
534632	534670	534621	534621	I	0	" With these words , Smithers seized his leathern thong , and was advancing towards the hump - back , when the wretched lad threw himself on his knees , clasped his hands together , and cried , "
534697	534698	534693	534693	you	3167	" "
534709	534720	534693	534693	you	3167	" said the executioner , dropping the already uplifted thong . "
534863	534864	534854	534854	I	0	" "
534880	534881	534877	534877	father	3167	" "
534930	534931	534932	534932	I	0	" "
534941	534948	534939	534939	father	3167	" resumed the lad , submissively ; "
534956	534957	534953	534953	I	0	" "
534961	534974	534953	534953	I	0	" cried Smithers , savagely , and taking up the thong again . "
534981	534985	534979	534979	father	3167	" faltered Gibbet . "
535062	535063	535065	535065	I	0	" "
535079	535094	535096	535096	you	0	" inquired the lad , the workings of whose countenance were now absolutely terrific . "
535103	535107	535100	535100	you	0	" answered Smithers . "
535205	535227	535233	535233	they	14727	" Gibbet clasped his hands together , and raised his eyes in an imploring manner , as much as to say , "
535236	535279	535233	535233	they	14727	" Fortunately for him , his father did not perceive this expression of emotion , for the executioner had approached the candle to the model - gallows , and was now busily occupied in arranging the figure for his son 's practice . "
535297	535302	535294	535294	I	0	" continued the executioner ; "
535465	535519	535461	535461	I	0	" While Smithers was thus talking , he had lowered the figure until it stood upon the drop . He then took off the halter ; but the puppet still retained its upright position , because it was well stiffened and had heavy plates of lead fastened to the soles of its feet . "
535538	535555	535533	535533	they	14741	" continued Smithers , as he unfastened the cord which pinioned the arms of the puppet ; "
535703	535745	535684	535684	I	0	" Smithers paused for a moment , and contemplated the puppet and the model - gallows with great admiration . He had fashioned the one and built the latter himself ; and he was not a little proud of his handiwork . "
535752	535758	535750	535750	Gibbet	1406	" he at length exclaimed ; "
535775	535776	535765	535765	you	1406	" "
535788	535797	535798	535798	you	3167	" returned the lad , bursting into tears , "
535802	535803	535798	535798	you	3167	" "
535806	535818	535798	535798	you	3167	" cried the executioner his countenance assuming an expression truly ferocious . "
535828	535843	535819	535819	You	3167	" added the unfortunate youth , shrinking from the glance of his savage parent . "
535851	535881	535849	535849	Gibbet	1406	" said the man , a little softened by the reminiscence that he himself had made his son the object of the very reproach levelled against his personal deformity . "
535906	535928	535943	535943	Gibbet	1406	" Gibbet approached the model - gallows ; but his countenance still denoted the most profoundly - rooted disgust and abhorrence . "
535945	535950	535943	535943	Gibbet	1406	" continued the executioner . "
535985	535999	535979	535979	you	1406	" Gibbet took the whip - cord which his father handed to him . "
536103	536118	536124	536124	you	1406	" Here Gibbet cast a hasty but terrified glance towards his father 's attire . "
536131	536140	536141	536141	you	1406	" said Smithers , with a coarse laugh ; "
536218	536328	536209	536209	we	14754	" Gibbet approached the puppet , and endeavoured to manipulate the string as his father instructed him ; but his hand trembled so convulsively that he could not even pass it between the arms of the figure . While he was still fumbling with the cord , and vainly endeavouring to master his emotions , the leathern thong descended with tremendous violence upon his back . An appalling cry burst from the poor lad ; but the executioner only showered down curses on his head . At length Gibbet contrived , through fear of another blow , to pinion the figure in a manner satisfactory to his brutal parent . "
536331	536335	536209	536209	we	14754	" exclaimed Smithers ; "
536606	536607	536610	536610	father	3167	" "
536612	536616	536610	536610	father	3167	" returned Gibbet . "
536625	536651	536619	536619	we	14780	" continued Smithers , once more busying himself with the puppet , which he surveyed with an admiration almost amounting to a kind of love . "
536696	536716	536680	536680	We	14780	" proceeded Smithers , alluding to the figure , and rather musing aloud than addressing himself to his son . "
536801	536802	536790	536790	I	0	" "
536806	536839	536790	536790	I	0	" cried Gibbet , literally writhing with mental agony , as the drop fell with a crashing sound , and the jerking noise of the halter met his ear a moment afterwards . "
536846	536905	536844	536844	coward	3389	" exclaimed the executioner ; and again the leathern thong elicited horrible screams from the hump - back . The lad was still crying , and his father was in the midst of sundry fearful anathemas , levelled against what he called his son 's cowardice , when a knock was heard at the door of the loft . "
536909	536942	536945	536945	Banks	1300	" shouted the executioner . The invitation was obeyed ; and an elderly man , dressed in a shabby suit of black , entered the room with an affected solemnity of gait . "
536947	536952	536945	536945	Banks	1300	" exclaimed the executioner . "
536966	536967	536963	536964	old feller	3550	" "
536975	536988	536972	536973	Mr. Smithers	1405	" returned the undertaker , shaking his head in a lachrymose manner , "
537013	537044	537046	537046	he	3550	" And , according to a custom which years had rendered a part of Mr. Banks 's nature , he wiped his eyes with a dingy white pocket - handkerchief . "
537054	537063	537050	537052	the old fool	5831	" ejaculated Smithers , with a coarse guffaw ; "
537098	537099	537081	537081	you	1405	" "
537145	537146	537139	537139	Smithers	1405	" "
537149	537154	537139	537139	Smithers	1405	" cried the executioner . "
537167	537185	537206	537207	Mr. Smithers	1405	" asked Mr. Banks , in a tremulous tone and with another solemn shake of the head . "
537194	537200	537206	537207	Mr. Smithers	1405	" was the prompt reply . "
537212	537220	537206	537207	Mr. Smithers	1405	" observed the undertaker of Globe Lane . "
537240	537241	537234	537235	Mr. Smithers	1405	" "
537259	537265	537252	537252	'em	14797	" demanded the executioner savagely . "
537279	537283	537271	537271	God	880	" answered Banks ; "
537316	537317	537319	537319	you	1405	" "
537328	537333	537319	537319	you	1405	" cried the executioner , "
537352	537353	537319	537319	you	1405	" "
537368	537382	537354	537354	I	0	" responded Mr. Banks , turning up his eyes in a melancholy manner . "
537555	537556	537562	537562	he	14800	" "
537566	537572	537562	537562	he	14800	" demanded the executioner impatiently . "
537591	537596	537562	537562	he	14800	" answered the undertaker . "
537613	537614	537606	537606	you	1405	" "
537633	537638	537627	537627	I	0	" answered Mr. Banks . "
537645	537650	537641	537643	you old rogue	14808	" shouted the executioner , "
537700	537701	537690	537690	you	1405	" "
537717	537730	537733	537733	I	0	" said the undertaker , with a solemn shake of his head ; "
537747	537748	537735	537735	I	0	" "
537762	537766	537754	537759	such fools as to be gulled	14812	" observed Smithers . "
537785	537789	537769	537769	they	26674	" demanded Banks . "
537883	537884	537871	537871	we	14817	" "
537892	537898	537871	537871	we	14817	" was the dogged answer . "
537906	537920	537904	537904	Smithers	1405	" said the undertaker , with a whining , coaxing tone and manner . "
537929	537930	537925	537925	I	0	" "
537936	537940	537941	537941	I	0	" said Banks . "
537966	537967	537955	537955	you	1405	" "
537972	537976	537955	537955	you	1405	" answered Smithers . "
537990	537996	537987	537988	the living	14822	" The undertaker muttered something about "
538000	538023	537955	537955	you	1405	" smoothed down the limp ends of his dirty cravat , and slowly withdrew , shaking his head more solemnly than ever . "
538034	538048	538030	538032	a Public Executioner	14823	" cried Smithers , turning with an air of triumph towards his son : "
538087	538088	538090	538090	father	3167	" "
538092	538105	538090	538090	father	3167	" cried the lad , unable to restrain his feelings any longer : "
538361	538471	538344	538344	I'll	0	" Smithers was so astounded at this appeal that he had allowed it to proceed without interruption . He was accustomed to be addressed on the same subject , but never to such a length , nor with such arguments ; so that the manner and matter of that prayer produced a strange impression on the man who constantly sought , by means of rude sophistries , to veil from himself and his family the true estimation in which his calling was held . Gibbet , mistaking his father 's astonishment for a more favourable impression , threw himself at his feet , clasped his hands , and exclaimed , "
538517	538518	538503	538503	I	0	" "
538524	538537	538541	538541	God	880	" cried the executioner , now recovering the use of his tongue : "
538543	538557	538541	538541	God	880	" he added , pointing with terrible ferocity towards the model - gallows , "
538584	538717	538572	538572	I	0	" Gibbet rose — disappointed , dispirited , and with a heart agitated by the most painful emotions . But why had not Smithers recourse to the leathern weapon as usual ? why had he spared the poor hump - back on this occasion ? Gibbet himself marvelled that such forbearance should have been shown towards him , since he now comprehended but too well that his father was inexorable in his determination with regard to him . The truth was that Smithers was so far struck by his son 's appeal as to deem it of more serious import than any previously manifested aversion to his horrible calling ; and he accordingly met it with a menace which he deemed to be more efficacious than the old discipline of the thong . "
538723	538735	538721	538721	me	0	" said the executioner , after a few moments ' pause , "
538820	539866	539869	539869	Kate	1413	" Smithers proceeded down stairs , followed by Gibbet . They entered a little parlour , where Katherine was preparing breakfast . It being still dark , a candle stood on the table ; and its light was reflected in the polished metal tea - pot , milk - jug , and sugar - basin . The table napkin was of dazzling whiteness : the knives and forks were bright as steel could be;—in a word , an air of exquisite neatness and cleanliness pervaded the board on which the morning 's repast was spread . Nor was this appearance confined to the table . The little room itself was a model of domestic propriety . Not a speck of dust was to be seen on the simple furniture , which was also disposed with taste : the windows were set off with a clean muslin curtain ; and the mantel was covered with fancy ornaments all indicative of female industry . Then Kate herself!—her appearance was in perfect keeping with that of the room which owed its cleanliness and air of simple comfort to her . A neat cap set off her chesnut hair , which was arranged in plain bands : her dark stuff gown was made high in the body and long in the skirt , but did not conceal the gracefulness of her slender form , nor altogether prevent a little foot in a neat shoe and a well - turned ankle in a lily - white cotton stocking from occasionally revealing themselves . Then her hands were so slightly brown , her fingers so taper , and her nails so carefully kept , that no one , to look at them , would conceive how much hard work Katherine was compelled to do . Though so rigidly neat and clean , Kate had nothing of the coquette about her . She was as bashful and artless as a child ; and , besides — whom had she , the executioner 's acknowledged niece , to captivate ? Although she endeavoured to greet Smithers and the hump - back with a smile , a profound melancholy in reality oppressed her . It was one of those mornings when her uncle was to exercise his horrible calling:—this circumstance would alone have deeply affected her spirits , which were never too light nor buoyant . But on the present occasion , another cause of sorrow weighed on her soul — and that was the knowledge that her wretched cousin was that morning to enter on his fearful noviciate ! She entertained a boundless compassion for that unfortunate being . His physical deformities , and the treatment which he experienced from his father , called forth the kindest sympathies of her naturally tender heart . Moreover , he had received instruction and was in the habit of seeking consolation from her : she was the only friend of that suffering creature who was persecuted alike by nature and by man ; and she perhaps felt the more acutely on his account , because she was so utterly powerless in protecting him from the parental ferocity which drove him to her for comfort . She knew that a good — a generous — a kind — and a deeply sensitive soul was enclosed within that revolting form ; and she experienced acute anguish when a brutal hand could wantonly torture so susceptible a spirit . And to that wounded , smarting spirit she herself was all kindness — all softness — all conciliation — all encouragement . No wonder , then , if the miserable son of the public executioner was devoted to her : no wonder if she were a goddess of light , and hope , and consolation , and bliss to him ! To do her the slightest service was a source of the purest joy which that poor being could know : to be able to convince her by a deed,—even so slight as picking up her thread when it fell , or placing her chair for her in its wonted situation,—this , this was sublime happiness to the hump - back ! He could sit for hours near her , without uttering a word — but watching her like a faithful dog . And when her musical voice , fraught with some expression of kindness , fell upon his ear , how that hideous countenance would brighten up — how those coarse lips would form a smile — how those large dull orbs would glow with ineffable bliss ! But when his father was unkind to her,—unkind to Katherine , his only friend,—unkind to the sole being that ever had looked not only without abhorrence , but with unadulterated gentleness on him,—then a new spirit seemed to animate him ; and the faithful creature , who received his own stripes with spaniel - like irresistance , burst forth in indignant remonstrance when a blow was levelled at her . Then his rage grew terrible ; and the resigned , docile , retiring hump - back became transformed into a perfect demon . How offensive to the delicate admirer of a maudlin romance , in which only handsome boys and pretty girls are supposed to be capable of playing at the game of Love , must be the statement which we are now about to make . But the reader who truly knows the world,—not the world of the sentimental novel , but the world as it really is,—will not start when we inform him that this being whom nature had formed in her most uncouth mould,—this creature whose deformities seemed to render him a connecting link between man and monkey,—this living thing that appeared to be but one remove above a monster , cherished a profound love for that young girl whom he esteemed as his guardian angel . But this passion was unsuspected by her , as its nature was unknown to himself . Of course it was not reciprocated:—how could it be ? Nevertheless , every proof of friendship — every testimonial of kind feeling — every evidence of compassion on her part , only tended to augment that attachment which the hump - back experienced for Katherine . "
539871	539887	539869	539869	Kate	1413	" said the executioner , as he took his seat at the breakfast - table , "
539900	539927	539888	539888	I	0	" The girl made no answer ; but she cast a rapid glance at the hump - back , and two tears trickled down her cheeks . "
539932	539936	539930	539930	Gibbet	1406	" added Smithers ; "
539970	539971	539963	539963	you	1406	" "
539982	539987	539992	539992	he	1295	" inquired Katherine timidly . "
540016	540049	540011	540011	you	0	" This was more or less true : the generous - hearted girl hoped yet to be able to avert her uncle from his intention in respect to the hump - back . "
540060	540071	540051	540051	I	0	" continued the executioner , as he ate his breakfast . "
540083	540084	540078	540078	you	0	" "
540096	540100	540086	540086	you	0	" said Kate . "
540115	540120	540122	540122	I	0	" returned the executioner ; "
540135	540136	540137	540137	I	0	" "
540151	540176	540137	540137	I	0	" observed Katherine , with her eyes fixed upon her cup — she dared not raise them to Smithers ' face as she spoke : "
540205	540206	540208	540208	your	29368	" "
540215	540220	540223	540223	me	0	" ejaculated the executioner ; "
540238	540268	540223	540223	me	0	" Gibbet rose and hastened from the room . In a few moments he returned , holding in his hand a paper , which he gave to his father . "
540275	540288	540271	540271	I	0	" said Smithers , as he glanced his eye over the paper : "
540361	540376	540350	540350	he	1428	" With these words Smithers tossed off his tea , rose , and exclaimed , "
540389	540390	540391	540391	Father	3167	" "
540401	540415	540393	540393	I	0	" murmured the hump - back , who seemed fixed to his chair . "
540422	540445	540446	540446	Uncle	29368	" cried the executioner , in so terrible a tone that Gibbet started from his seat as if suddenly moved by electricity . "
540462	540479	540454	540454	you	29368	" began Katherine , venturing upon a last appeal in favour of the hump - back . "
540482	540514	540480	540480	Kate	1413	" said the executioner , turning abruptly upon her , while his countenance wore so ferocious an expression of mingled determination and rage , that the young girl uttered an ejaculation of alarm,—"Kate
540524	540825	540480	540480	Kate	1413	" He said no more , but darted on her a look of such dark , diabolical menace , that she sank back , annihilated as it were , into her seat . She covered her face with her hands , and burst into an agony of tears . For some moments she remained absorbed in profound grief : the fate of the wretched hump - back , and the idea that she herself was doomed to exist beneath the same roof with the horrible man whom she called her uncle , were causes of bitter anguish to her tender and sensitive soul . When she raised her head , and glanced timidly around , she found herself alone . The dawn was now breaking ; and Katherine extinguished the candle . How gloomily does the young day announce itself to the dwellers in the narrow streets and obscure alleys of the poor districts of the metropolis ! The struggling gleam appears to contend with difficulty against the dense atmosphere and noxious vapours which prevail in those regions even in the midst of winter ; and as each fitful ray steals through the dingy panes , its light seems leaden and dull , not golden and roseate as that of the orb of day . Kate wiped away her tears , and set to work to clear the table of the breakfast - things . Having performed this duty , she slipped on her neat straw bonnet and warm shawl,—purchased by the produce of her own industry,—and repaired to market . But , alas ! poor girl — as she passed rapidly through the streets , she could not help noticing the people , that were lounging at their doors , nudge each other , as much as to say , "
540833	540843	540828	540831	the executioner 's niece	39065	" And no friendly voice welcomed her with a kind "
540847	540911	540828	540831	the executioner 's niece	39065	" no human being had a passing compliment,—not even one of those civil phrases which cost nothing to utter , mean perhaps as little , but still are pleasing to hear,—to waste upon the executioner 's niece . Some old women , more hard - hearted than the rest , exclaimed , as she hurried timidly by the spot where they were gossiping , "
540925	541328	540828	540831	the executioner 's niece	39065	" And when the poor girl reached the shop whither she was going , her eyes were bathed in tears . The shopkeeper was cool and indifferent in his manner towards her — not obsequious and ready as towards his other customers . He even examined with suspicion the coin which she tendered him in payment for her purchases — as if it were impossible that honesty could dwell in the heart of an executioner 's niece ! The ill - conditioned fellow ! He saw not the mild blue eyes , with a tear glittering in each like twin - drops of the diamond - dew;—he marked not the pretty lips , apart , and expressive of such profound melancholy;—he observed not the thick folds of the shawl across the gently - budding bosom rise and sink rapidly:—no,—he beheld not that interesting young creature 's grief ; but he treated her rudely and harshly , because she was the executioner 's niece ! Kate retraced her steps homewards . She saw other girls of her own age nod familiarly to their acquaintances at the windows , as they passed;—but she had no friend to receive or return her smile of recognition ! Shrinking within herself , as it were , from the slightest contact with the world which despised her , the poor young creature felt herself an interloper upon the very pavement , and even stepped into the muddy street to make way for those who passed . With a broken spirit she returned home , her fate weighing upon her soul like a crime ! And so it was with her always on those mornings when her uncle was called upon to exercise his fearful functions . She was glad to bury herself once more in that dwelling the threshold of which a friendly step so seldom crossed : her little parlour , embellished with her own hands , appeared a paradise of peace after the contumely which she experienced in the bustling streets . She had returned home in so depressed a state of mind that she had forgotten to close the front door behind her . She opened her work - box , seated herself at the table , and commenced her toil of pleasure — for that young girl loved her needle , and abhorred idleness . She then fell into a reverie as she worked . "
541338	541343	541331	541332	a hangman	14871	" she mused aloud ; "
541492	541493	541494	541494	You	14879	" "
541505	541542	541494	541494	You	14879	" said a mild voice close behind her chair . Kate started , and looked round . It was the rector of St. David 's who had entered he room , unperceived by the young maiden . "
541549	541553	541544	541544	me	0	" answered Kate ; "
541576	541577	541582	541583	poor child	9899	" "
541585	541595	541582	541583	poor child	9899	" interrupted Reginald Tracy , to whose cheeks the phrase "
541598	541625	541582	541583	poor child	9899	" brought a flush of crimson — for he remembered how he himself had deviated from the doctrines which he had long successfully and sincerely taught : "
541653	541654	541639	541639	I	0	" "
541663	541667	541639	541639	I	0	" exclaimed Katherine . "
541675	541676	541677	541677	We	14883	" "
541681	541694	541677	541677	We	14883	" answered the rector , taking a chair near the young maiden . "
541705	541706	541707	541707	I	0	" "
541761	541856	541857	541857	I	0	" Kate raised her mild blue eyes towards the rector 's countenance ; but her glance drooped again instantaneously , for his looks were fixed upon her in a manner which she had never noticed in him before , and which excited a momentary feeling of embarrassment — almost of alarm — in her mind . But that feeling passed away as rapidly as it had arisen ; and she blushed to think that she should have experienced such a sentiment in the presence of so holy a man and so great a benefactor . "
541880	541884	541885	541885	I	0	" said Reginald . "
541896	541897	541898	541899	Another friend	3476	" "
541901	541907	541898	541899	Another friend	3476	" ejaculated the young girl . "
541921	541922	541923	541923	You	14889	" "
541926	541931	541923	541923	You	14889	" replied Mr. Tracy . "
541952	541953	541933	541935	not a gentleman	14895	" "
541964	541993	541933	541935	not a gentleman	14895	" And she stopped short , being unwilling to allude to that instance of her uncle 's cruelty which had led to the visit mentioned by the rector . "
542003	542007	542008	542008	He	3618	" continued Reginald . "
542022	542023	542015	542015	he	3618	" "
542034	542044	542026	542026	strangers	2803	" asked Katherine , her eyes swimming in tears . "
542048	542053	542026	542026	strangers	2803	" replied the rector . "
542069	542070	542071	542071	He	2368	" "
542076	542088	542071	542071	He	2368	" exclaimed Katherine , with an enthusiasm which was almost pious . "
542150	542151	542134	542134	He	2368	" "
542163	542168	542134	542134	He	2368	" exclaimed Katherine fervently . "
542172	542173	542134	542134	He	2368	" "
542177	542283	542134	542134	He	2368	" demanded Reginald , in whose eyes the young maiden had never been an object of peculiar interest until at present;—and now he observed , for the first time , that her personal appearance was far — very far from disagreeable . The truth was , that , since his fall , he had viewed every woman with different eyes from those through which he had before surveyed the female sex . When he himself was chaste and pure , he observed only the feminine mind and manner:—now his glances studied and discriminated between external attractions . His moral survey had become a sensual one . "
542287	542295	542134	542134	He	2368	" he said , when Katherine hesitated . "
542304	542305	542134	542134	He	2368	" "
542322	542328	542316	542316	I	0	" was the immediate answer . "
542407	542408	542415	542415	him	14908	" "
542424	542428	542429	542429	I	0	" said Reginald . "
542466	542467	542459	542459	I	0	" "
542489	542494	542473	542473	he	14905	" said the rector . "
542497	542501	542473	542473	he	14905	" exclaimed Kate . "
542528	542529	542573	542573	he	14905	" "
542532	542555	542573	542573	he	14905	" replied the fashionable preacher , who during this colloquy had gradually drawn his chair closer to that of the young maiden . "
542617	542618	542619	542621	The generous stranger	14921	" "
542623	542627	542619	542621	The generous stranger	14921	" exclaimed Kate . "
542642	542643	542644	542645	Mr. Markham	874	" "
542648	542649	542644	542645	Mr. Markham	874	" "
542652	542667	542650	542650	Markham	874	" cried the young girl , strangely excited by the mention of that name . "
542678	542800	542671	542671	you	0	" asked the rector , surprised at the impression thus produced . Katherine appeared to reflect profoundly for some moments ; then , opening a secret drawer of her work - box , she drew forth a small satin bag , carefully sewed all round . She took her scissors and unpicked the thread from one end of the bag . The rector watched her attentively , and with as much surprise as interest . Having thus opened one extremity of the bag , she inserted her delicate fingers , and produced a sheet of letter - paper , folded , and dingy with age . Handing it to the rector , she observed , with tears streaming down her cheeks , "
542825	542839	542812	542812	she	27004	" Reginald Tracy unfolded the letter , and read as follows : — — "
542900	542989	542892	542893	Mr. Markham	874	" The words that originally stood in the place which we have marked with asterisks , had evidently been blotted out by the tears of the writer . Reginald folded the letter as he had received it , and returned it to Katherine . The young girl immediately replaced it in the little bag , which she sewed up with scrupulous care . It was the poor creature 's sole treasure ; and she prized it as the last and only memento that she possessed of her mother . "
543001	543036	543037	543037	I	0	" said the rector , after a long pause , during which the bag , with its precious contents , had been consigned once more to the secret drawer in the work - box . "
543044	543052	543037	543037	I	0	" answered Kate , drying her tears . "
543116	543117	543101	543101	Markham	874	" "
543129	543130	543127	543127	him	2203	" "
543183	543216	543162	543162	I	0	" And again the young maiden wept bitterly . The rector was deeply affected ; and for some minutes his sensual ideas concerning the damsel were absorbed in a more generous sympathy . "
543242	543244	543245	543245	he	2203	" asked Reginald,—"did
543255	543256	543245	543245	he	2203	" "
543268	543272	543274	543274	he	29276	" answered Kate ; "
543315	543316	543308	543310	the medical man	32095	" "
543330	543335	543336	543336	She	3173	" asked the rector . "
543341	543342	543336	543336	She	3173	" "
543351	543352	543344	543344	she	3173	" "
543362	543363	543359	543360	Katherine Wilmot	1413	" "
543377	543382	543367	543367	you	14926	" said the rector . "
543410	543411	543388	543390	a superior woman	14947	" "
543422	543426	543420	543420	sir	26649	" observed Katherine . "
543448	543449	543443	543443	himself	14949	" "
543453	543484	543485	543487	Mr. Richard Markham	874	" exclaimed Reginald , whose eyes were once more fixed upon the interesting girl near him,—fixed , too , with an ardent glance , and not one of tender sympathy . "
543558	543559	543560	543560	I	0	" "
543577	543581	543574	543574	your	26649	" said Katherine . "
543614	543615	543616	543616	I	0	" "
543623	543628	543616	543616	I	0	" resumed the clergyman , "
543647	543658	543660	543660	my	0	" and he cast upon her a burning look brimful of licentiousness—"I
543695	544253	544254	544254	I	0	" He paused for a moment:—he hesitated , because at the back of the offer there was an unworthy motive at which his guilty soul quaked , lest it should betray itself . But that pure - minded and artless girl only saw in that offer a noble act of kindness ; and she frankly accepted it — upon the condition that her uncle approved of her conduct in doing so . The rector rose — he had no farther excuse for protracting his visit . The young girl thanked him for his goodness with the most heart - felt sincerity . He then took his leave . Reginald Tracy proceeded from the dwelling of the hangman to the corner of Tottenham Court Road , where his carriage was waiting for him . He stepped into the vehicle , and ordered the coachman to drive him to Markham Place near Lower Holloway . Richard was not at home : he had gone for a short walk with Mr. Monroe , who was yet too feeble to move far without the support of a companion 's arm . They were , however , expected to return in a short time;—besides , Miss Monroe was in the drawing - room ; and the rector therefore decided upon walking in and waiting for Mr. Markham . The name of Miss Monroe produced a powerful sensation in the breast of that man whose passions until lately dormant from his birth , now raged so furiously . He had seen her in a voluptuous negligee , attending by the sick - bed of her father;—he had heard her utter words of strange self - accusing import , in connection with that parent 's illness;—and his curiosity , as well as his desires , was kindled . He had been fascinated by that charming girl ; and our readers will remember that he had felt himself capable of making any sacrifice to obtain her love ! His mind , too , entertained a distant suspicion — a very distant one , but still a suspicion — that she had strayed from the path of virtue;—for of what else could a daughter , whom he had seen hanging like a ministering angel over her father 's couch , accuse herself ? This suspicion — and , at all events , that mystery which hung around the accusation alluded to , served to inflame the imagination of a man who now sought to place no bridle upon his passions . The idea suggested itself to him , that if another had revelled in her charms , why should not he ? In a word , his heart glowed with secret delight when he learnt from Whittingham that Miss Monroe was alone in the drawing - room . On his entrance , Ellen rose from the sofa , and welcomed him with a cordiality which originated in a sense of gratitude for the spiritual comfort he had rendered her father during his illness . At a glance his eyes scanned the fair form of Ellen from head to foot ; and his imagination was instantly fired with the thoughts of her soft and swelling charms — those graceful undulations which were all her own , and needed no artificial aids to improve the originals of nature ! "
544279	544284	544254	544254	I	0	" said the rector . "
544293	544298	544254	544254	I	0	" exclaimed Ellen cheerfully . "
544317	544318	544307	544307	I	0	" "
544327	544332	544319	544319	I	0	" observed the rector ; "
544347	544348	544350	544350	myself	0	" "
544352	544359	544360	544360	You	0	" interrupted Ellen , blushing deeply . "
544366	544367	544360	544360	You	0	" "
544371	544376	544368	544368	I	0	" answered the rector . "
544479	544480	544481	544482	Mr. Tracy	1353	" "
544484	544494	544481	544482	Mr. Tracy	1353	" exclaimed Ellen , cruelly embarrassed by this language , "
544511	544512	544496	544496	you	1353	" "
544548	544549	544534	544534	you	14957	" "
544560	544578	544534	544534	you	14957	" cried Ellen , tears starting from her eyes , while her cheeks were suffused with blushes : "
544606	544607	544534	544534	you	14957	" "
544614	544622	544534	544534	you	14957	" said the rector with apparent meekness : "
544655	544656	544658	544658	me	0	" "
544674	544685	544686	544687	Miss Monroe	1117	" said Ellen , completely deceived by this consummate hypocrisy . "
544689	544693	544695	544695	me	0	" continued Reginald , "
544793	544794	544795	544795	I	0	" "
544806	544817	544800	544800	your	0	" said Ellen , now recovering her presence of mind ; "
544835	544836	544844	544845	Miss Monroe	1117	" "
544847	544866	544844	544845	Miss Monroe	1117	" persisted the rector , determined not to abandon the point to which he had so dexterously conducted the conversation,—"that
544876	544877	544844	544845	Miss Monroe	1117	" "
544892	544897	544898	544898	I	0	" interrupted Ellen firmly . "
544925	544926	544912	544912	I	0	" "
544956	545027	545030	545030	mamma	8688	" These words were uttered in so decided a tone , that Reginald dared not persist in his attempt to thrust himself into the young lady 's confidence . An awkward silence ensued ; and the rector was thinking how he should break it , when the door opened . Almost at the same moment , a female voice was heard outside the room , saying , in tender playfulness , "
545036	545178	545034	545034	mamma	8688	" Then , immediately afterwards , Marian entered the apartment , bearing an infant in her arms . Whittingham had neglected to tell her that there was a visitor in the drawing - room . Poor Marian , astounded at the presence of the rector , could neither advance nor retreat for some moments . At length she turned abruptly away . Ellen sank back upon the sofa , overcome with shame and grief . The rector threw upon her a glance full of meaning ; but she saw it not — for her own eyes were cast down . This depression , however , lasted only for a moment . Suddenly raising her head , she exclaimed with that boldness and firm frankness which had been taught her by the various circumstances of the last few years of her life , "
545201	545202	545190	545193	a man of honour	26739	" "
545215	545231	545190	545193	a man of honour	26739	" asked Reginald , taking her hand — that soft , warm , delicate hand . "
545240	545265	545190	545193	a man of honour	26739	" returned Ellen , withdrawing her hand hastily from what she however conceived to be only the pressure of a friendly or fraternal interest ; "

545306	545313	545298	545298	I	0	" cried the rector , enthusiastically . "
545320	545362	545315	545315	you	14974	" murmured Ellen , completely deceived in respect to the cause of Tracy 's warmth , and mistaking for friendly interest an ebullition of feeling which was in reality gross and sensual . With these words Ellen hurried from the room . "
545369	545392	545363	545363	I	0	" said the rector triumphantly to himself , as he rose and paced the apartment , mad passions raging in his breast ; "
545478	545549	545444	545444	I	0	" Reginald threw himself , exhausted by the indomitable violence of his passions , upon the sofa . Scarcely had he time to compose himself , when Markham entered the room . The rector communicated to him the particulars of his interview with Katherine Wilmot , and concluded by saying that , as the girl was known to his housekeeper , he had determined upon taking her into his service . "
545559	545563	545444	545444	I	0	" observed Richard , "
545630	545631	545650	545650	you	0	" "
545642	545647	545650	545650	you	0	" observed the rector . "
545681	545682	545683	545683	My	0	" "
545692	545716	545689	545689	I	0	" exclaimed Richard , who , in the natural generosity of his heart , gave the rector credit for the most worthy motives . "
545764	547123	547124	547125	My God	27430	" Some farther conversation took place between Reginald Tracy and Richard Markham upon this subject , and when the former rose to depart , they both observed , for the first time during their interview , that a violent shower of rain was pouring down . Richard pressed the rector to remain to dinner — an invitation which he , whose head was filled with Ellen , did not hesitate to accept . The rector 's carriage and horses were accordingly housed in the stables attached to Markham Place ; and Whittingham was desired to make Mr. Tracy 's coachman and livery - servant as comfortable as possible — instructions with which the hospitable old butler did not fail to comply . Dinner was served up at five o'clock ; and Reginald had the felicity of sitting next to Miss Monroe . The more he saw of this young lady , the more did he become enraptured with her,—not , however , experiencing a pure and chaste affection , but one whose ingredients were completely sensual . The evening passed rapidly away;—the rain continued to pour in torrents . As a matter of courtesy — indeed , of hospitality , for Richard 's nature was generosity itself — the rector was pressed to stay the night at the Place ; and , although he had a good close carriage to convey him home ( and persons who have such equipages are seldom over careful of their servants ) , he accepted the invitation . There was something so pleasing — so intoxicating in the idea of passing the night under the same roof with Ellen ! It was scarcely light when the rector of Saint David 's rose from a couch where visions of a most voluptuous nature had filled his sleep . Having hastily dressed himself , he descended from his room with the intention of seeking the fine frosty air of the garden to cool his heated brain . But as he proceeded along a passage leading to the landing of the first flight of stairs , he heard a light step slowly descending the upper flight ; and the next moment , the voice of Ellen speaking fondly to her child , fell upon his ear . For nurses and mothers will talk to babes of even a few months old — although the innocents comprehend them not ! Reginald stepped into the recess formed by the door of one of the bed - chambers in that spacious mansion ; and scarcely had he concealed himself there when he saw Ellen , with the child in her arms , pass across the landing at the end of the passage , and enter a room on the other side . She wore a loose dressing - gown of snowy whiteness , which was confined by a band round her delicate waist , and was fastened up to the throat : her little feet had been hastily thrust into a pair of buff morocco slippers ; and her long shining hair flowed over her shoulders and down her back . The licentious eyes of the clergyman followed her from the foot of the stairs to the room which she entered ; and even plunged with eager curiosity into that chamber during the moment that the door was open as she went in . That glance enabled him to perceive that there was a bath in the apartment to which Ellen had proceeded with her child . Indeed , the young lady , ever since her residence at Markham Place , had availed herself of the luxury of the bathing - room which that mansion possessed : and every morning she immersed her beautiful person in the refreshing element , which she enjoyed in its natural state in summer , but which was rendered slightly tepid for her in winter . When the rector beheld her descend in that bewitching negligee,—her hair unconfined , and floating at will — her small , round , polished ankles glancing between the white drapery and the little slippers,—and the child , with merely a thick shawl thrown about it , in her arms,—and when he observed the bath in that chamber which she entered , he immediately comprehended her intention . Without a moment 's hesitation he stole softly from the recess where he had concealed himself , and approached the door of the bath - room . His greedy eyes were applied to the key - hole ; and his licentious glance plunged into the depths of that sacred privacy . The unsuspecting Ellen was warbling cheerfully to her child . She dipped her hand into the water , which Marian had prepared for her , and found the degree of heat agreeable to her wishes . Then she placed the towels near the fire to warm . Reginald watched her proceedings with the most ardent curiosity : the very luxury of the unhallowed enjoyment which he experienced caused an oppression at his chest ; his heart beat quickly ; his brain seemed to throb with violence . The fires of gross sensuality raged madly in his breast . Ellen 's preparations were now completed . With her charming white hand she put back her hair from her forehead . Then , as she still retained the child on her left arm , with her right hand she loosened the strings which closed her dressing - gown round the neck and the band which confined it at the waist . While thus occupied , she was partly turned towards the door ; and all the treasures of her bosom were revealed to the ardent gaze of the rector . His desires were now inflamed to that pitch when they almost become ungovernable . He felt that could he possess that charming creature , he would care not for the result — even though he forced her to compliance with his wishes , and murder and suicide followed,—the murder of her , and the suicide of himself ! He was about to grasp the handle of the door , when he remembered that he had heard the key turn in the lock immediately after she had entered the room . He gnashed his teeth with rage . And now the drapery had fallen from her shoulders , and the whole of her voluptuous form , naked to the waist , was exposed to his view . He could have broken down the door , had he not feared to alarm the other inmates of the house . He literally trembled under the influence of his fierce desires . How he envied — Oh ! how he envied the innocent babe which the fond mother pressed to that bosom — swelling , warm , and glowing ! And now she prepared to step into the bath : but , while he was waiting with fervent avidity for the moment when the whole of the drapery should fall from her form , a step suddenly resounded upon the stairs . He started like a guilty wretch away from the door : and , perceiving that the footsteps descended the upper flight , he precipitated himself down the stairs . Rushing across the hall , he sought the garden , where he wandered up and down , a thousand wild feelings agitating his breast . He determined that Ellen should be his ; but he was not collected enough to deliberate upon the means of accomplishing his resolution,—so busy was his imagination in conjuring up the most voluptuous idealities , which were all prompted by the real scene the contemplation whereof had been interrupted . He fancied that he beheld the lovely young mother immersed in the bath — the water agitated by her polished limbs — each ripple kissing some charm , even as she herself kissed her babe ! Then he imagined he saw her step forth like a Venus from the ocean — her cheeks flushed with animation — her long glossy hair floating in rich undulations over her ivory shoulders . "
547127	547134	547124	547125	My God	27430	" he exclaimed , at length , "
547263	547617	547619	547619	me	0	" The rector 's reverie was suddenly interrupted by the voice of Whittingham summoning him to the breakfast - room . Thither he proceeded ; and there Ellen , now attired in a simple but captivating morning - dress , presided . Little did she imagine that the privacy of her bath had been invaded — violated by the glance of that man who now seated himself next to her , and whose sanctity was deemed to be above all question . Little , either , did her father and friend suppose that there was one present who had vowed that she should be his , and who , in connection with that determination , had entertained no thought of marriage . The ramble in the garden had so far cooled the rector 's brain , that nothing in his behaviour towards Ellen was calculated to excite observation ; but , from time to time , when unperceived , he cast upon her a glance of fervent admiration — a long , fixed , devouring glance , which denoted profound passion . At length the hour for departure arrived ; and his carriage drove round to the front door . The rain of the preceding evening had changed to frost during the night;—the morning was fine , fresh , and healthy , though intensely cold ; there was hence no shadow of an excuse for a longer stay . The rector expressed his thanks for the hospitality which he had experienced , with that politeness which so eminently characterised his manners ; and when he shook hands with Ellen , he pressed hers gently . She thought that he intended to convey a sort of assurance that the secret which he had detected on the previous day , was sacred with him ; and she cast upon him a rapid glance , expressive of gratitude . Reginald then stepped into the carriage , which immediately rolled rapidly away towards London . Upon his arrival at home , he proceeded straight to his study , whither he was immediately followed by the old housekeeper . "
547627	547632	547624	547625	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" said the rector ; "
547639	547640	547641	547641	I	0	" "
547649	547676	547641	547641	I	0	" observed the old woman , fidgetting about the room , for with senile pertinacity she was resolved to say what she had upon her mind : "
547681	547685	547677	547677	I	0	" she continued , "
547706	547707	547692	547692	you	26649	" "
547725	547750	547722	547723	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" said the rector , who , like all guilty persons , was half afraid that his conduct was suspected by the old woman . "
547791	547797	547798	547798	I	0	" added the old housekeeper , "
547810	547811	547802	547802	I	0	" "
547816	547824	547802	547802	I	0	" said the rector , somewhat softened . "
547837	547838	547843	547843	they	15002	" "
547850	547856	547843	547843	they	15002	" interrupted the old woman ; "
547867	547868	547864	547864	you	26649	" "
547874	547883	547871	547871	you	0	" demanded Reginald , now once more irritated . "
547904	547917	547902	547902	sir	26649	" answered the housekeeper , wiping away a tear from her eye . "
547976	547977	547970	547970	you	26649	" "
547980	548002	547970	547970	you	26649	" ejaculated Reginald , struck by the imprudence of which he had been guilty in admitting Lady Cecilia into his abode . "
548026	548037	548009	548010	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" he added , half afraid to ask the question ; "
548064	548065	548058	548058	you	26649	" "
548077	548082	548068	548068	sir	26649	" returned the housekeeper , "
548096	548097	548098	548099	The clerk	2971	" "
548101	548105	548109	548109	he	2971	" ejaculated Reginald ; "
548112	548113	548109	548109	he	2971	" "
548134	548135	548116	548116	he	2971	" "
548142	548165	548138	548140	an impertinent fellow	15011	" cried the rector , thrown off his guard by the alarming announcement that a change in his behaviour had been observed . "
548179	548189	548176	548176	I	0	" observed the housekeeper , with a deep sigh . "
548197	548208	548194	548195	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" said the rector , vexed at his own impatience : "
548252	548303	548315	548316	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" The rector floundered in the midst of his falsehood ; but the old housekeeper readily believed him , and was rejoiced to think that he had at length honoured her with his confidence in respect to the cause of that restlessness which she had mistaken for a secret grief . "
548318	548328	548305	548307	no one else	3364	" said the rector , in a tone of conciliation "
548341	548342	548332	548333	no one	26771	" "
548360	548361	548362	548362	Ah!—well	1431	" "
548364	548365	548362	548362	Ah!—well	1431	" "
548419	548420	548401	548401	she	1008	" "
548431	548432	548424	548424	you	0	" "
548441	548464	548465	548468	The servant - maid	15022	" answered the housekeeper , surprised at the question , as if there were any thing else to tell save the truth . "
548486	548487	548465	548468	The servant - maid	15022	" "
548491	548509	548512	548512	sir	26649	" echoed Reginald , seriously annoyed at this repetition of visits from Lady Cecilia 's confidential servant . "
548532	548537	548527	548527	she	1008	" continued the housekeeper . "
548551	548555	548539	548539	you	0	" mused Reginald . "
548562	548563	548558	548559	Lady Cecilia	1008	" "
548568	548582	548566	548566	sir	26649	" cried the housekeeper , more surprised still at her master 's observations . "
548599	548600	548595	548597	Lady Cecilia Harborough	1008	" "
548608	548616	548595	548597	Lady Cecilia Harborough	1008	" stammered the rector , cruelly embarrassed : "
548625	548626	548627	548630	The Reverend Reginald Tracy	1350	" "
548635	548654	548627	548630	The Reverend Reginald Tracy	1350	" said the housekeeper , who was as proud of her master as she was attached to him . "
548662	548667	548659	548660	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" exclaimed the rector . "
548696	548812	548691	548691	I	0	" Up to this moment the housekeeper had spoken in the full conviction that annoyance alone was the cause of her master 's recent change of behaviour and present singularity of manners ; but his increasing embarrassment — the strangeness of his observations relative to Lady Cecilia — his anxiety lest she should entertain an evil idea concerning his absence from home,—added to a certain vague rumour which had reached her ears relative to the lightness of that lady 's character,—all these circumstances , united with the fact of Cecilia having sent so often to request Mr. Tracy to call upon her , suddenly engendered a suspicion of the truth in the housekeeper 's mind . "
548821	548843	548814	548814	you	0	" said the housekeeper , wishing to discard that suspicion , and therefore hastening to change the conversation to another topic , "
548865	548866	548859	548860	Katherine Wilmot	1413	" "
548874	548879	548882	548882	she	1413	" exclaimed the rector . "
548901	548906	548882	548882	she	1413	" continued Mrs. Kenrick , "
548938	548939	548941	548941	you	0	" "
548950	548954	548941	548941	you	0	" said Reginald . "
548969	549013	548960	548960	I	0	" answered the old lady , who , in spite of the natural excellence of her heart , was somewhat piqued at not having been previously consulted upon the subject : then , ashamed of this littleness of feeling , she hastily added , "
549051	549052	549043	549043	I	0	" "
549056	549110	549043	549043	I	0	" said the rector , not sorry to be relieved of the presence of his housekeeper , in whose manner his guilty conscience made him see a peculiarity which filled his mind with apprehension . In a few minutes Katherine Wilmot entered the rector 's study . Her story was brief but painful . "
549282	549291	549275	549275	I	0	" continued the girl , with a shudder , "
549418	549463	549406	549406	he	29276	" Katherine ceased , and wiped her eyes . The poor girl had said nothing of the terrific beating which the executioner inflicted upon Gibbet the moment they returned home , and then upon Katherine herself before he thrust her out of the house . "
549477	549498	549475	549475	Katherine	1413	" inquired the rector , who during the maiden 's simple narrative , had never taken his eyes off her . "
549515	549519	549499	549500	My uncle	29276	" replied Katherine ; "
549544	549545	549551	549551	Kate	1413	" "
549553	549558	549551	549551	Kate	1413	" observed the rector ; "
549571	549572	549575	549575	sir	26649	" "
549584	549589	549575	549575	sir	26649	" ejaculated the girl , "
549605	549606	549609	549609	you	26649	" "
549614	549635	549609	549609	you	26649	" said Reginald , prolonging the conversation only because the presence of an interesting female had become his sole enjoyment . "
549642	549656	549661	549661	yourself	1413	" continued the rector , rising from his seat , and approaching her , "
549673	549674	549675	549675	I	0	" "
549683	549687	549675	549675	I	0	" returned Katherine . "
549705	549710	549689	549689	you	1413	" said the rector . "
549731	549732	549733	549733	I	0	" "
549744	549887	549733	549733	I	0	" was the artless reply . The rector gave some more trivial directions , and dismissed his new domestic to her duties . He then hastened to Tavistock Square , to appease Lady Harborough , whose jealousy , he suspected , had been aroused by his absence from home . To make his peace with Lady Cecilia was by no means a difficult matter ; and it was accomplished rather by the aid of the rector 's purse than his caresses . He remained to dinner with the syren who had first seduced him from the paths of virtue , which he had pursued so brilliantly and triumphantly — too brilliantly and triumphantly to ensure stability ! In the evening , when they were seated together upon the sofa , Reginald implored her to be more cautious in her proceedings in future . "
549899	549903	549733	549733	I	0	" he said , "
549940	549941	549925	549926	my housekeeper	14890	" "
549947	549957	549945	549945	Reginald	1350	" murmured Cecilia , casting her arms around him ; "
549968	549969	549962	549962	you	1350	" "
549985	549990	549980	549980	you	15064	" said the rector . "
550046	550047	550026	550026	she	14890	" "
550056	550083	550049	550049	I	0	" whispered Cecilia , accompanying her words with voluptuous kisses , so that in a short time the rector 's ill - humour was completely subdued . "
550087	550091	550049	550049	I	0	" she added , "
550110	550111	550102	550102	I	0	" "
550116	550121	550114	550114	Cecilia	1008	" answered the clergyman ; "
550173	550449	550164	550164	we	15067	" Reginald Tracy now rose , embraced his mistress , and took his leave . But it was not to return home immediately . His mind was filled with Ellen 's image ; and , even while in the society of Lady Cecilia , he had been pondering upon the means of gratifying his new passion — of possessing that lovely creature of whose charms he had caught glimpses that had inflamed him to madness . Amongst a thousand vague plans , one had struck him . He remembered the horrible old woman of Golden Lane , who had enticed him to her house under a pretence of seeing a beautiful statue , and had thereby led him back to the arms of Lady Cecilia Harborough . To her he was determined to proceed ; for he thought that he might be aided in his designs by that ingenuity of which he had received so signal a proof . Accordingly , wrapping himself up in his cloak , he repaired directly from Lady Cecilia 's house to the vile court in Golden Lane . It was past seven o'clock in the evening when he reached the old hag 's abode . She was dozing over a comfortable fire ; and her huge cat slept upon her lap . Even in the midst of her nap , the harridan mechanically stretched forth her bony hand from time to time , and stroked the animal down the back ; and then it purred in acknowledgment of that caress which to a human being would have been hideous . Suddenly a knock at the door awoke the hag . "
550454	550478	550164	550164	we	15067	" murmured the old woman , as she rose , placed the cat upon the rug , and hastened to answer the door : "
550489	550501	550479	550481	no idle visitor	15069	" The moment she opened the door the rector rushed in . "
550506	550512	550479	550481	no idle visitor	15069	" said the old hag : "
550525	550539	550542	550542	you	15070	" she cried , as Reginald Tracy laid aside his hat and cloak ; "
550555	550556	550552	550552	you	15070	" "
550561	550574	550552	550552	you	15070	" demanded the rector , as he threw himself into a chair . "
550593	550598	550600	550600	they	15073	" answered the hag ; "
550605	550606	550603	550603	women	1934	" "
550616	550621	550607	550607	You	15070	" said the rector . "
550638	550639	550640	550640	You	26649	" "
550656	550675	550654	550654	sir	26649	" observed the harridan , with one of her most significant and , therefore , most wicked leers . "
550708	550712	550698	550699	Lady Harborough	1008	" cried Reginald . "
550731	550738	550714	550714	you	26649	" answered the old woman boldly . "
550754	550755	550714	550714	you	26649	" "
550759	550781	550714	550714	you	26649	" said the rector ; and , taking gold from his purse , he flung it upon the table , adding , "
550814	550815	550816	550816	You	26649	" "
550831	550845	550829	550829	sir	26649	" said the hag , as she gathered up the gold with avidity . "
550864	550869	550877	550877	her	15081	" continued the rector ; "
550919	550920	550917	550917	wife	3414	" "
550930	550935	550936	550936	I	0	" murmured the hag . "
550943	550948	550936	550936	I	0	" said Reginald Tracy . "
551008	551009	551001	551001	Accident	993	" "
551022	551029	551030	551030	She	15081	" cried the harridan , musing . "
551049	551050	551043	551046	a very young man	15091	" "
551053	551063	551043	551046	a very young man	15091	" cried the hag , struck by this information . "
551069	551070	551066	551066	her	15081	" "
551074	551079	551071	551072	Ellen Monroe	1117	" replied the rector . "
551084	551090	551080	551080	I	0	" exclaimed the old woman . "
551097	551104	551091	551091	You	0	" cried Reginald Tracy in astonishment . "
551119	551120	551106	551106	you	0	" "
551136	551137	551138	551138	She	15081	" "
551162	551167	551168	551168	My	0	" demanded the rector . "
551179	551184	551168	551168	My	0	" said the hag . "
551225	551226	551203	551203	I	0	" "
551229	551234	551235	551235	I	0	" said the rector : "
551242	551256	551235	551235	I	0	" But tell me — have you any hope that I may succeed ? "
551257	551265	551267	551268	the hag	29746	" The business is a difficult one , "
551270	551349	551267	551268	the hag	29746	" And yet greater obstacles than I can here see have been overcome — aye , and by me , too . Did I not tell Lady Harborough that I would bring you back to her arms ? and did I not succeed ? Am I then to be foiled now . Show me the weakness of a human being , and I direct all my energies against that failing . Ellen Monroe has two vulnerable points — — "
551350	551355	551357	551358	the rector	32742	" Which are they ? "
551361	551371	551373	551374	the harridan	31270	" Her vanity and her love for her father , "
551376	551394	551373	551374	the harridan	31270	" Leave her to me : when I am ready for you I will call upon you . "
551395	551406	551408	551409	the rector	32742	" And you will lose no time , good woman ? "
551420	551432	551434	551435	the hag	29746	" I will not let the grass grow under my feet , "
551437	551464	551434	551435	the hag	29746	" But you must have patience ; for the girl is stubborn — sadly stubborn . Art , and not entreaties , will prevail with her . "
551465	551484	551486	551487	the rector	32742	" In any case , manage your matters in such a way that I can not be compromised , "
551489	551498	551486	551487	the rector	32742	" and your reward shall be most liberal . "
551499	551504	551506	551507	the hag	29746	" Trust to me , "
551524	551535	551537	551538	the hag	29746	" And so I have made a discovery this evening ! "
551547	551707	551537	551538	the hag	29746	" Miss Ellen is a mother — she has a child of six or seven months old ! She never told me that when she came to seek my aid , and I gave her the card of the Mesmerist;—she never told me that when she sought me after that , and I sent her to the Manager;—she never told me that when I met her at Greenwood 's house in the country , and from which she escaped by the window . The cunning puss ! She does not even think that I know where she lives;—but Lafleur told me that — Lafleur told me that ! He is the prince of French valets — worth a thousand such moody , reserved Italians as Filippo ! So now the rector must possess Miss Ellen ? Well — and he shall , too , if I have any skill left — if I have any ingenuity to aid him ! "
551765	551768	551769	551769	she	29746	" Yes , "
551777	551986	551769	551769	she	29746	" I must not fail in this instance . The rector is a patron who will not spare his gold ; and Ellen may not be the only one he may covet . I warrant he will not keep me unemployed ! These parsons are terrible fellows when once they give way ; and I should think the rector has not been long at this game , or he could scarcely have contrived to maintain his reputation as he has . How the world would be astonished did it know all ! But I am astonished at nothing — not I ! No — no — I have seen too much in my time . And if I repent of any thing — but no I do not repent:—still , if I did sometimes think of one more than another , ' tis of that poor Harriet Wilmot ! I should like to know what became of her . It must be sixteen or seventeen years since that occurred;—but the mention of the name of Markham just now , brought it all fresh back again to my mind . Well — it can not be helped : it was in the way of business like any thing else ! "
552079	552089	552091	552091	Reginald	1350	" What do you want , my good lad ? "
552093	552109	552091	552091	Reginald	1350	" Please , sir , I want to speak to Kate Wilmot , my cousin , "
552118	552136	552138	552138	Reginald	1350	" Indeed ! I suppose , then , that you are the son of — of — — "
552156	552161	552142	552142	he	1350	" of the hangman , "
552176	552184	552186	552187	the lad	28865	" My name is Smithers , sir , "
552189	552198	552200	552201	the rector	32742	" Ah ! Smithers — so it is , "
552203	552264	552200	552201	the rector	32742	" Well , my good lad , I can not think of preventing Katherine 's relations from coming to see her if they choose ; but , as she is now in a good place and respectably settled , it would perhaps be prudent that those visits should occur as seldom as possible — I mean , not too often . "
552265	552285	552287	552291	the poor hump - back	39309	" I 'm sure , sir , I 'm very sorry if I have offended you , by coming , "
552293	552321	552287	552291	the poor hump - back	39309	" and I would not for all the world injure Kate in the opinion of those friends who have been so kind as to provide for her . "
552322	552336	552338	552339	the rector	32742	" Yon have done no harm — I am not angry with you , "
552341	552364	552338	552339	the rector	32742	" Only Mrs. Kenrick , my housekeeper , is very particular , and does not like the servants to have many visitors . "
552365	552376	552378	552378	Gibbet	1406	" Then I wo n't come any more , sir , "
552391	552405	552378	552378	Gibbet	1406	" Yes — you may come and see your cousin every Sunday evening . "
552406	552420	552422	552425	the hump - back	14348	" Oh ! thank you , sir — thank you kindly , sir ! "
552434	552445	552447	552448	the rector	32742	" Every Sunday evening , then , let it be , "
552450	552474	552447	552448	the rector	32742	" And now go round by the back way , and see her to - night , since you wish to do so . "
552875	552909	552869	552869	he	1406	" No Kate — they shall not prevent me from seeing you of an evening when I will — and when , too , you will little suspect that I am so near . "
552940	552957	552935	552938	the hump - back	14348	" Mr. Tracy says that I may come and see you every Sunday evening , Kate , "
552964	552976	552959	552959	Gibbet	1406	" you wo n't say no — will you , Kate ? "
552977	552983	552985	552986	the maiden	31069	" Certainly not , John , "
552988	553002	553003	553003	she	31069	" I shall always be glad to see you , my poor cousin , "
553007	553017	553019	553022	the hump - back	14348	" Oh ! I know you will , Kate , "
553024	553050	553051	553051	he	1406	" I have missed you so all yesterday afternoon , and all to - day ; and father is more unkind to me than ever , "
553061	553073	553075	553075	Katherine	1413	" We must hope that better times await you , John , "
553082	553087	553089	553089	Gibbet	1406	" Never for me , "
553096	553399	553089	553089	Gibbet	1406	" Father does not cease to upbraid me for my conduct yesterday morning . But I could not help it . I went down to Newgate with the intention to do my best ; but when I got there , and found myself face to face with the miserable wretch who was about to suffer,—when I saw his awful pale face , his wild glaring eyes , his distorted features , his quivering limbs,—and when I heard him murmur every other moment , ' O Lord ! O Lord ! ' in a tone scarcely audible and yet expressive of such intense anguish,—I could not lay a finger upon him ! When my father gave me the twine to pinion him , it fell from my hands ; and I believe I felt as much as the unfortunate man himself . Oh ! heavens — his face will haunt me in my dreams as long as I live . I never shall forget it — it was so ghastly , so dreadful ! I would not have had any thing to do with taking that man 's life away — no , not for all the world . I did not see a criminal before me — I only saw a fellow - creature from whom his fellow - creatures were about to take away something which God alone gave , and which God alone should have the right to recall . I thought of all this ; and I was paralysed . And it was because my nature would not let me touch so much as the hem of that man 's garment to do him harm , that my father upbraids and beats me . Oh ! it is too cruel , Kate — it is too cruel to bear ! "
553400	553408	553410	553411	the girl	27605	" It is , my poor cousin , "
553413	553441	553445	553445	she	27605	" but let me entreat you to submit patiently — as patiently as you can . Times must change for you — as they have for me . "
553522	553534	553536	553536	Katharine	1413	" You will come and see me next Sunday , John , "
553547	553555	553556	553556	he	1406	" Next Sunday evening , dear Kate , "
553588	553601	553586	553586	herself	29758	" I must lose no time — I must lose no time . "
553852	553863	553847	553847	she	29758	" She is well lodged — she is well lodged ! "
554114	554119	554120	554120	Ellen	1117	" It is she ! "
554252	554259	554261	554261	Ellen	1117	" What are you doing here ? "
554265	554275	554277	554278	the harridan	31270	" Resting myself , as you see , miss , "
554280	554312	554277	554278	the harridan	31270	" But how charming you look this morning ! That black velvet bonnet sets off your beautiful complexion ; and the fresh air has given a lovely glow to your cheeks . "
554313	554324	554326	554326	Ellen	1117	" You have not uttered that compliment without a motive , "
554339	554371	554326	554326	Ellen	1117	" But you must not suppose that your flattery will make me forget the part which you played when Mr. Greenwood had me conveyed to his house somewhere in the country . "
554372	554387	554389	554391	the old hag	29758	" My dear child , do not be angry with me on that account , "
554393	554410	554389	554391	the old hag	29758	" Mr. Greenwood thought that you would prefer me as your servant instead of a stranger . "
554411	554451	554453	554453	Ellen	1117	" Or rather , he hired you to talk me over to his wishes — or , perhaps , because he knew that you would wink at any violence which he might use . But I outwitted you both , "
554457	554472	554474	554475	the hag	29746	" Ah ! now I see that you have forgiven me , my child , "
554477	554516	554474	554475	the hag	29746	" And when I behold your sweet lips , red as cherries — your lovely blue eyes , so soft and languishing — and that small round chin , with its charming dimple , I feel convinced — — "
554517	554527	554529	554529	Ellen	1117	" Nay — you are determined to flatter me , "
554531	554545	554529	554529	Ellen	1117	" but I shall not forgive you the more readily on that account . "
554546	554559	554561	554562	the hag	29746	" How well this pelisse becomes your beautiful figure , my child , "
554573	554578	554580	554581	Miss Monroe	1117	" Cease this nonsense , "
554583	554592	554580	554581	Miss Monroe	1117	" and tell me what brings you hither . "
554593	554603	554529	554529	Ellen	1117	" To see you once more , my child . "
554604	554612	554561	554562	the hag	29746	" How did you discover my abode ? "
554613	554620	554622	554623	the hag	29746	" A pleasant question , forsooth ! "
554625	554645	554646	554646	she	1117	" Do you think that I am not well acquainted with all — yes , all that concerns you ? "
554650	554665	554667	554667	Ellen	1117	" Alas ! I am well aware that you know much — too much , "
554674	554677	554679	554680	the hag	29746	" Much ! "
554682	554704	554679	554680	the hag	29746	" I know all , I say,—even to the existence of the little one that will some day call you mother . "
554705	554718	554720	554720	Ellen	1117	" Who told you that ? Speak — who told you that ? "
554725	554736	554738	554739	the hag	29746	" It can not matter — since I know it , "
554741	554747	554738	554739	the hag	29746	" it can not matter . "
554748	554752	554679	554680	the hag	29746	" One question , "
554754	554768	554738	554739	the hag	29746	Ellen,—"and I will ask you no more . Was Mr. Greenwood your informant ? "
554769	554774	554776	554777	the hag	29746	" He was not , "
554779	554808	554776	554777	the hag	29746	" And now tell me , without circumlocution , what business has brought you hither — for that you came to meet with me I have no doubt . "
554809	554818	554820	554821	the hag	29746	" Sit down by me , my child , "
554823	554832	554820	554821	the hag	29746	" and listen while I speak to you . "
554833	554845	554847	554847	Ellen	1117	" Nay — I can attend to you as well here , "
554871	554881	554883	554884	the hag	29746	" You seem to have no confidence in me , "
554886	554896	554883	554884	the hag	29746	" and yet I have ever been your friend . "
554897	554908	554910	554910	Ellen	1117	" Yes — you have helped me to my ruin , "
554914	554969	554910	554910	Ellen	1117	" And yet I scarcely blame you for all that , because you only aided me to discover what I sought at the time — and that was bread at any sacrifice . Well — go on , and delay not : I will listen to you , if only through motives of curiosity . "
554970	554975	554977	554978	the harridan	31270	" My sweet child , "
554994	555086	554977	554978	the harridan	31270	" a strange thing has come to my knowledge . What would you think if I told you that a man of pure and stainless life , who is virgin of all sin,—a man who to a handsome exterior unites a brilliant intellect,—a man whose eloquence can excite the aristocracy as well as produce a profound impression upon the middle classes,—a man possessed of a fine fortune and a high position,—what would you think , I say , if I told you that such a man has become enamoured of you ? "
555087	555106	555108	555108	Ellen	1117	" I should first wonder how such a phœnix of perfection came to select you as his intermediate , "
555120	555131	555133	555134	the hag	29746	" A mere accident made me acquainted with his passion , "
555136	555189	555133	555134	the hag	29746	" But surely you would not scorn the advances of a man who would sacrifice every thing for you — who would consent to fall from his high place for one single hour of your love — who would lay his whole fortune at your feet as a proof of his sincerity . "
555190	555204	554977	554978	the harridan	31270	" To cut short this conversation , I will answer you with sincerity , "
555208	555306	554977	554978	the harridan	31270	" Mr. Greenwood is the only man who can boast of a favour which involves my shame : he is the father of my child . I do not love him — I have no reason to love him : nevertheless , he is — I repeat — the father of my child ! That expresses every thing . Who knows but that , sooner or later , he may do me justice ? And should such an idea ever enter his mind , must I not retain myself worthy of that repentant sentiment on his part ? "
555307	555317	555319	555320	the hag	29746	" You cherish a miserable delusion , my child , "
555322	555346	555319	555320	the hag	29746	" and I am surprised at your confidence in the good feelings of a man of whom you have already seen so much . "
555347	555362	555364	555364	Ellen	1117	" Ah ! there is a higher power that often sways the human heart , "
555395	555425	555427	555428	the woman	27628	" You will then allow this man of whom I have spoken , and who has formed so enthusiastic an attachment towards you , to languish without a hope ? "
555430	555438	555440	555440	Ellen	1117	" Men do not die of love , "
555446	555458	555460	555462	the old harridan	29904	" But he is rich — and he would enrich you , "
555464	555493	555460	555462	the old harridan	29904	" he would place your father in so happy a position that the old man should not even experience a regret for the prosperity which he has lost . "
555494	555506	555508	555508	Ellen	1117	" My father dwells with a friend , and is happy , "
555510	555516	555518	555520	the old hag	29758	" But he is dependant , "
555522	555573	555518	555520	the old hag	29758	" for you yourself once said to me , ' We are dependant upon one who can not afford to maintain us in idleness . ' How happy would you be — for I know your heart — to be enabled to place your father in a state of independence ! "
555574	555596	555460	555462	the old harridan	29904	" Would he be happy did he know that he owed the revival of his prosperity to his daughter 's infamy ? "
555597	555638	555518	555520	the old hag	29758	" Did he divine whence came the bread that was purchased by your services to the statuary , the artist , the sculptor , and the photographer ? You yourself assured me that you kept your avocations a profound secret . "
555639	555656	555658	555658	Ellen	1117	" Were I inclined to sell myself for gold , Greenwood would become a liberal purchaser , "
555660	555684	555658	555658	Ellen	1117	" All your sophistry is vain . You can not seduce me from that state of tranquil seclusion in which I now dwell . "
555685	555703	555705	555706	the hag	29746	" At least grant your unknown lover an interview , and let him plead his own cause , "
555724	555734	555736	555736	Ellen	1117	" Ah ! think not that he is unknown , "
555746	555819	555736	555736	Ellen	1117	" a man of pure and stainless life , virgin of all sin,—a man endowed with a handsome person , and a brilliant intellect,—a man whose eloquence acts as a spell upon all classes,—a man possessed of a large fortune and enjoying a high position,—such is your description ! And this man must have seen me to love me ! Now think you I can not divine the name of your phœnix ? "
555820	555829	555937	555939	the young lady	4262	" You suspect then , my child — — "
555830	555844	555846	555846	Ellen	1117	" Nay — I have something more than mere suspicion in my mind , "
555848	555881	555883	555885	the young lady	4262	" Oh ! now I comprehend the motive of that apparent earnestness with which he implored me to reveal the secret sorrow that oppressed me ! In a word , old woman , "
555894	555906	555883	555885	the young lady	4262	" your phœnix is the immaculate rector of St. David 's ! "
555907	555919	555921	555922	the hag	29746	" And do you not triumph in your conquest , Miss ? "
555930	555935	555937	555939	the young lady	4262	" Oh ! yes , "
555950	555966	555937	555939	the young lady	4262	" so much so , that I will meet him when and where you will . "
555967	555972	555974	555975	the hag	29746	" Are you serious ? "
555979	556000	556002	556002	Ellen	1117	" Did I ever jest when I agreed to accept the fine offers which you made me on past occasions ? "
556004	556018	556020	556022	the old woman	26813	" No : and you can not have an object in jesting now , "
556024	556039	556020	556022	the old woman	26813	" But when and where will you meet him who is enamoured of you ? "
556040	556053	555937	555939	the young lady	4262	" You say that he will make any sacrifice to please me ? "
556054	556061	555937	555939	the young lady	4262	" He will — he will . "
556062	556149	556020	556022	the old woman	26813	" Then he can not refuse the appointment which I am about to propose to you . On Monday evening next there is to be a masked ball at Drury Lane Theatre . At ten o'clock precisely I will be there , dressed as a Circassian slave , with a thick veil over my face . Let him be attired as a monk , so that he may be enabled to shroud his features with his cowl . We shall not fail to recognise each other . "
556150	556160	556162	556164	the old woman	26813	" Again I ask if you are in earnest ? "
556172	556179	556181	556181	Ellen	1117	" I was never more so , "
556183	556196	556198	556199	the hag	29746	" But why can not the appointment take place at my abode ? "
556201	556217	556219	556219	Ellen	1117	" Oh ! fie — the immaculate rector in your dirty court in Golden Lane ! "
556221	556234	556236	556238	the old woman	26813	" That court was once good enough for you , my child , "
556240	556249	556251	556253	the young lady	4262	" We will not dispute upon that point , "
556255	556293	556251	556253	the young lady	4262	" If I am worth having , I am worth humouring ; and I must test the sincerity of the attachment which your phœnix experiences for me , by making him seek me at a masked ball . "
556294	556304	556306	556307	the hag	29746	" Oh ! the caprices of you fair ones ! "
556309	556326	556306	556307	the hag	29746	" Well , my child , I will undertake that it shall be as you desire . "
556327	556335	556337	556337	Ellen	1117	" Next Monday evening at ten o'clock , "
556700	556703	556694	556701	Turks who had never uttered a " Bismillah	39777	" Bismillah , "
557160	557166	557168	557170	the Greek Brigand	15257	" What ? Ellen here ! "
557174	557183	557168	557170	the Greek Brigand	15257	" I must not lose sight of her ! "
557339	557344	557346	557355	an Ancient Knight in a buff jerkin and plumed tocque	15259	" Fair eastern lady , "
557357	557380	557346	557355	an Ancient Knight in a buff jerkin and plumed tocque	15259	" if thou hast lost the swain that should attend upon thee , accept of my protection until thou shalt find him . "
557381	557390	557392	557392	Ellen	1117	" Thanks for thy courtesy , Sir Knight , "
557396	557411	557392	557392	Ellen	1117	" I am come to confess to a holy father whom I see yonder . "
557412	557425	557427	557428	the Knight	15260	" Wilt thou then abjure thine own creed , and embrace ours ? "
557430	557440	557442	557442	Ellen	1117	" Such is indeed my intention , Sir Knight , "
557487	557491	557493	557494	Reginald Tracy	1350	" Sweet girl , "
557514	557528	557510	557510	Ellen	1117	" how can I sufficiently thank you for this condescension on your part ? "
557529	557558	557560	557560	Ellen	1117	" I am fully recompensed by the attention you have shown to the little caprice which prompted me to choose this scene for the interview that you desired , "
557592	557596	557598	557598	Ellen	1117	" Mr. Tracy , "
557600	557631	557598	557598	Ellen	1117	" why did you entrust your message of love to another ? why could you not impart with your own lips that which you were anxious to communicate to me ? "
557632	557636	557638	557639	the rector	32742	" Dearest Ellen , "
557641	557664	557638	557639	the rector	32742	" I dared not open my heart to you in person — I was compelled to do so by means of another . "
557665	557674	557676	557676	Ellen	1117	" If your passion be an honourable one , "
557678	557690	557676	557676	Ellen	1117	" there was no need to feel shame in revealing it . "
557691	557775	557638	557639	the rector	32742	" My passion is most sincere , Ellen . I would die for you ! Oh ! from the first moment that I beheld you by your father 's sick - bed , I felt myself drawn towards you by an irresistible influence ; and each time that I have since seen you has only tended to rivet more firmly the chain which makes me your slave . Have I not given you an unquestionable proof of my sincerity by meeting you here ? "
557776	557789	557791	557791	Ellen	1117	" A proof of your desire to please me , no doubt , "
557793	557830	557791	557791	Ellen	1117	" But what proof have I that your passion is an honourable one ? You speak of its sincerity — you avoid all allusion to the terms on which you would desire me to return it . "
557831	557838	557840	557841	the rector	32742	" What terms do you demand ? "
557843	557881	557840	557841	the rector	32742	" Shall I lay my whole fortune at your feet ? Shall I purchase a splendid house , with costly appointments , for you ? In a word , what proof of my love do you require ? "
557882	557911	557913	557913	Ellen	1117	" Are you speaking as a man who would make a settlement upon a wife , or as one who is endeavouring to arrange terms with a mistress ? "
557915	557920	557922	557922	Reginald	1350	" My sweet girl , "
557924	557989	557922	557922	Reginald	1350	" know you not that , throughout my career , I have from the pulpit denounced the practice of a man in holy orders marrying , and that I have more than once declared — solemnly declared — my intention of remaining single upon principle ? You would not wish me to commit an inconsistency which might throw a suspicion upon my whole life ? "
557990	558022	558024	558024	Ellen	1117	" Then , sir , by what right do you presume that I will compromise my fair fame for your sake , if you tremble to sacrifice your reputation for mine ? "
558026	558200	558206	558207	the rector	32742	" Is every compromise to be effected by poor woman , and shall man make no sacrifice for her ? Are you vile , or base , or cowardly enough to ask me to desert home and friends to gratify your selfish passion , while you carefully shroud your weakness beneath the hypocritical cloak of a reputed sanctity ? Was it to hear such language as this that I agreed to meet you ? But know , sir , that you have greatly — oh ! greatly mistaken me ! By the most unmanly — the most disgraceful means you endeavoured to wring from me , a few days ago , a secret which certain expressions of mine , incautiously uttered over what I conceived to be my father 's death - bed , had perhaps made you more than half suspect . Those words , which escaped me in a moment of bitter anguish , you treasured up , and converted them into the text for a sermon which you preached me . "
558201	558204	558206	558207	the rector	32742	" Ellen , "
558209	558214	558206	558207	the rector	32742	" why these reproaches ? "
558215	558225	558227	558237	the young lady , whose bosom palpitated violently beneath the dualma	15272	" Oh ! why these reproaches?—I will tell you , "
558239	558622	558227	558237	the young lady , whose bosom palpitated violently beneath the dualma	15272	" Do you think that you did well to press me to reveal the secret of my shame ? Do you think that you adopted an honourable means to discover it ? When you addressed me in that saintly manner — a manner which I now know to have been that of a vile hypocrisy — I actually believed you to be sincere ; for the time I fancied that a man of God was offering me consolation . Nevertheless , think you that my feelings were not wounded ? But an accident made you acquainted with that truth which you vainly endeavoured to extort from me ! And now you perhaps believe that I can not read your heart . Oh ! I can fathom its depths but too well . You cherish the idea that because I have been frail once , I am fair game for a licentious sportsman like you . You are wrong , sir — you are wrong . I never erred but once — but once , mark you;—and then not through passion — nor through love — nor in a moment of surprise . I erred deliberately — no matter why . The result was the child whom you have seen . But never , never will I err more — no , not even though tempted , as I have been , by the father of my child ! You sent to me a messenger — the same filthy hag who pandered to my first , my only disgrace,—you sent her as your herald of love . Ah ! sir , you must have already plunged into ways at variance with the sanctity of your character — or you could not have known her ! I told her — as I now assure you — that I do not affect a virtue which I possess not;—but if I henceforth remain pure and chaste , it is because I am a mother — because I love my child — because I will keep myself worthy of the respect of him who is the father of that child , should God ever move his heart towards me . Say then that I am virtuous upon calculation — I care not : still I am virtuous ! "
558680	558688	558690	558690	Reginald	1350	" Ellen , what means all this ? "
558692	558703	558690	558690	Reginald	1350	" are you angry with me ? You alarm me ! "
558704	558717	558719	558719	Ellen	1117	" Suffer me to proceed , that you may understand me fully , "
558721	558778	558719	558719	Ellen	1117	" You mercilessly sought to cover me with humiliation , when you rudely probed that wound in my heart , the existence of which an unguarded expression of mine had revealed to you . Your conduct was base — was cowardly ; and , as a woman , I eagerly embraced the opportunity to avenge myself . "
558779	558784	558786	558786	Reginald	1350	" To avenge yourself ! "
558800	558807	558809	558809	Ellen	1117	" Yes — to avenge myself , "
558812	559023	558809	558809	Ellen	1117	" When your messenger — that vile agent of crime — proposed to me that I should grant you an interview , I bethought myself of this ball which I had seen announced in the newspapers . It struck me that if I could induce you — you , the man of sanctity — to clothe yourself in the mummery of a mask and meet me at a scene which you and your fellow - ecclesiastics denounce as one worthy of Satan , I should hurl back with tenfold effect that deep , deep humiliation which you visited upon me . It was for this that I made the appointment here to - night — for this that I retired early to my chamber , and thence stole forth unknown to my father and my benefactor — for this that I now form one at an assembly which has no charms for me ! My intention was to seize an opportunity to tear your disguise from you , and allow all present to behold amongst them the immaculate rector of Saint David 's . But I will be more merciful to you than you were to me : I will not inflict upon you that last and most poignant humiliation ! "
559024	559035	559037	559038	the rector	32742	" My God ! Miss Monroe , are you serious ? "
559043	559054	559037	559038	the rector	32742	" or is this merely a portion of the pastime ? "
559055	559063	559065	559065	Ellen	1117	" Does it seem sport to you ? "
559067	559088	559065	559065	Ellen	1117	" if so , I will continue it , and wind it up with the scene which I had abandoned . "
559089	559103	559105	559105	Reginald	1350	" For heaven 's sake , do not expose me , Miss Monroe ! "
559120	559136	559105	559105	Reginald	1350	" Let me depart — and forget that I ever dared to address you rudely . "
559137	559142	559144	559144	Ellen	1117	" Yes — go , "
559146	559187	559144	559144	Ellen	1117	" you are punished sufficiently . You possess the secret of my frailty — I possess the secret of your hypocrisy : beware of the use you make of your knowledge of me , lest I retaliate by exposing you . "
559289	559299	559284	559284	he	1436	" By heavens ! she is a noble creature ! "
559505	559512	559513	559513	she	3304	" Mr. Tracy — Mr. Tracy , "
559516	559525	559513	559513	she	3304	" here is a note from Lady Harborough . "
559526	559539	559541	559542	the rector	32742	" Tell Lady Harborough to go to the devil , Mrs. Kenrick ! "
559603	559613	559615	559616	the rector	32742	" What is the matter now , Mrs. Kenrick ? "
559639	559646	559648	559649	the housekeeper	39575	" Nothing , sir — nothing , "
559672	559686	559652	559652	she	39575	" only I thought that something very terrible had occurred to annoy you . "
559687	559699	559701	559701	Reginald	1350	" Yes — yes — I have indeed been grievously annoyed , "
559703	559744	559652	559652	she	39575	" and you must forgive my hasty conduct . I was wrong — very wrong . Do not think anything more of it , Mrs. Kenrick . But did you not observe that Lady Harborough had sent a message — — "
559745	559755	559767	559767	she	39575	" A note , sir . Here it is . "
559795	559811	559812	559812	she	39575	" I am afraid , sir , that something very dreadful has happened to you , "
559816	559824	559812	559812	she	39575	" Shall I send for the physician ? "
559825	559864	559767	559767	she	39575	" No — no , Mrs. Kenrick : I shall be quite well in the morning . I have received a violent shock — the sudden communication of ill news — the death of a dear friend — — "
559865	559879	559881	559882	the housekeeper	39575	" Ah ! sir , I was convinced that all was not right , "
559884	559906	559881	559882	the housekeeper	39575	" If you would follow my advice you would take something to compose you — to make you sleep well — — "
559907	559946	559767	559767	she	39575	" An excellent thought , Mrs. Kenrick ! If it be not too late , I wish you would send and procure me a little laudanum : I will take a few drops to ensure a sound slumber . "
559947	559955	559957	559958	the housekeeper	39575	" I will do so , sir , "
559991	560105	559977	559978	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Nearly a week has elapsed , dearest Reginald , and I have not seen you ! neither have I heard from you . What is the meaning of this ? Is it neglect , or extreme caution ? At all events the interval which you enjoined for the cessation of my visits to you , has nearly expired ; and my impatience will brook no longer delay . I must see you to - night ! Precisely as the clock strikes twelve , I will be at your front - door , when you must admit me as on previous occasions — or I shall imagine that you are already wearied of your "
560109	560114	559977	559978	Lady Cecilia	1008	" said the rector , "
560213	560288	560205	560205	she	15308	" The rector seated himself before the cheerful fire which burnt in the grate , and fell into a long train of voluptuous meditation . He had become in so short a time a confirmed sensualist ; and now that his long pent - up passions had broken loose , they never left him a moment of repose . His reverie was interrupted by a knock at the door ; and Mrs. Kenrick entered . "
560303	560307	560295	560296	a druggist	15309	" she said , "
560322	560323	560318	560318	you	26649	" "
560327	560332	560318	560318	you	26649	" returned the rector : "
560350	560466	560467	560467	Cecilia	1008	" The housekeeper wished her master a good night 's rest , and withdrew . The rector then took a decanter of wine from a cupboard , and tossed off two glasses full , one immediately after the other . The idea that Cecilia would shortly be there and the effects of the wine inflamed his blood , and brought back the colour to his cheeks . Midnight soon sounded : the rector threw off his shoes , took a candle in his hand , and hastened down stairs . He opened the front - door with the utmost caution ; and a female , muffled in an ample cloak , darted into the hall . "
560469	560474	560467	560467	Cecilia	1008	" whispered the rector . "
560478	560604	560476	560476	Reginald	1350	" answered the lady , in the same under tone . They then stole noiselessly up stairs , and reached the rector 's chamber without having scarcely awakened the faintest echo in the house . The remainder of the night was passed by them in the intoxicating joys of illicit love . Locked in Cecilia 's arms , the rector forgot the humiliation he had received at the hands of Ellen , and abandoned himself to those pleasures for which he risked so much ! It was still dark — though at a later hour in the morning than Cecilia had been previously in the habit of quitting the rector 's house — when the guilty pair stole softly down stairs , without a light . "
560609	560614	560607	560607	Cecilia	1008	" murmured the rector : "
560622	560623	560624	560625	My God	27430	" "
560627	560632	560624	560625	My God	27430	" whispered the lady : "
560639	560655	560633	560633	I	0	" The rector listened for a moment , and then said in a faint tone , "
560662	560700	560633	560633	I	0	" A light flashed on the wall a few steps beneath those on which they were standing : it was too late to retreat ; and in another moment Mrs. Kenrick made her appearance on the stairs . "
560706	560834	560703	560704	Mr. Tracy	1353	" ejaculated the housekeeper , her eyes glancing from the rector in his dressing - gown to the lady in her cloak . Then the good woman stood motionless and silent — her tongue tied , and her feet rooted to the spot , with astonishment . Lady Cecilia drew her veil hastily over her countenance ; but not before Mrs. Kenrick had recognised her . A thousand ideas passed rapidly through the rector 's brain during the two or three moments that succeeded this encounter . At first he thought of inventing some excuse for his awkward situation;—next he felt inclined to spring upon his old housekeeper and strangle her;—then he conceived the desperate idea of rushing back to his room and blowing his brains out . "
560838	560844	560835	560836	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" at length he exclaimed , "
560854	560876	560847	560847	you	1430	" The housekeeper made no reply to her master ; but , turning a contemptuous glance upon the lady , said , "
560889	560929	560880	560880	me	0	" Cecilia followed her mechanically ; and Reginald rushed up the stairs to his room , a prey to emotions more readily conceived than described . The housekeeper preceded Lady Cecilia in silence , and opened the front door . "
560935	560951	560932	560933	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" said the frail patrician , who had now nearly recovered her presence of mind , "
560964	560965	560954	560954	you	1430	" "
560973	560978	560971	560971	madam	26758	" answered the housekeeper ; "
561012	561075	560986	560986	I	0	" She then closed the door unceremoniously , and , seating herself on one of the mahogany benches in the hall , burst into tears . That good woman loved her master with a maternal affection ; and she was shocked at this dread confirmation of the faint suspicions which she had already entertained , and which had so sorely afflicted her . "
561081	561087	560986	560986	I	0	" she thought within herself . "
561262	561315	561253	561253	He	15317	" Thus did the good woman reason within herself . When she had somewhat recovered from the first shock which the unpleasant discovery of her master 's criminality had produced upon her , she repaired to her domestic avocations . Kate was already in the kitchen , occupied with her usual duties . "
561322	561327	561316	561316	Katherine	1413	" said Mrs. Kenrick , "
561355	561356	561346	561346	I	0	" "
561362	561380	561346	561346	I	0	" exclaimed the young maiden , desisting from her employment , and preparing to listen with attention . "
561387	561392	561346	561346	I	0	" continued the housekeeper ; "
561416	561417	561410	561410	you	1413	" "
561431	561435	561425	561425	I	0	" said Kate ; "
561460	561461	561479	561479	I	0	" "
561490	561491	561479	561479	I	0	" "
561496	561506	561509	561509	Katherine	1413	" cried Kate , astonished at this unexpected announcement . "
561517	561522	561509	561509	Katherine	1413	" proceeded Mrs. Kenrick . "
561562	561563	561554	561554	She	15332	" "
561577	561581	561567	561567	you	0	" asked Kate : "
561603	561624	561584	561584	you	0	" she added , bursting into tears ; for she thought of her poor persecuted cousin the hump - back . "
561634	561639	561678	561678	ma'am	26745	" returned Mrs. Kenrick : "
561674	561675	561668	561668	you	15337	" "
561691	561696	561684	561684	I	0	" interrupted the girl : "
561710	561711	561697	561698	the executioner	3575	" "
561718	561726	561697	561698	the executioner	3575	" exclaimed the good - natured housekeeper ; "
561771	561797	561762	561762	you	15337	" There was an earnestness in the way in which Mrs. Kenrick spoke that immediately removed from Katherine 's mind the suspicion she had entertained . "
561810	561827	561800	561800	you	15337	" said the footman , now suddenly emerging from the pantry , which joined the kitchen . "
561838	561845	561836	561836	Thomas	911	" exclaimed Mrs. Kenrick , angrily . "
561854	561859	561846	561846	I	0	" answered the footman , "
561869	561870	561861	561861	I	0	" "
561898	561903	561891	561891	you	15337	" remarked the housekeeper . "
561913	561917	561918	561918	I	0	" exclaimed Thomas . "
561935	561936	561920	561920	you	15337	" "
561952	561957	561937	561937	You	15337	" said Mrs. Kenrick . "
561972	561982	561967	561967	you	15337	" she continued , now addressing herself to Katherine , "
562026	562045	562046	562046	Thomas	911	" The housekeeper then resumed her avocations with the complacency of one conscious of having performed a duty . "
562048	562056	562046	562046	Thomas	911	" she said , after a pause , "
562078	562087	562088	562088	Master	27070	" The footman hastened to obey this order . "
562102	562190	562191	562191	Master	27070	" was the information which the man gave on his return to the kitchen . The housekeeper made no reply : she was however pleased when she reflected that the rector felt his situation — a state of mind which she hoped would lead to complete repentance and reform . The morning passed : the afternoon arrived : and still Reginald Tracy kept his room . The housekeeper sent the footman up to ask if he required any thing . Thomas returned with a negative answer , adding "
562212	562282	562203	562203	his	27435	" Again the housekeeper remained silent , more convinced than before that contrition was working its good effects with her master . Hour after hour passed ; the sun went down ; and darkness once more drew its veil over the mighty city . Mrs. Kenrick again sent up Thomas with the same inquiry as before . The servant returned to the kitchen with a letter in his hand . "
562290	562294	562285	562285	master	27070	" he said ; "
562319	562368	562369	562369	My	0	" Thomas then departed to execute his commission . Shortly after he was gone , the bell of the rector 's room rang . Mrs. Kenrick hastened to answer it . She found Mr. Tracy sitting in a musing attitude before the fire in his bed - room . "
562374	562378	562371	562372	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" he said , "
562439	562440	562428	562428	I	0	" "
562447	562455	562428	562428	I	0	" exclaimed the housekeeper , in surprise . "
562464	562469	562459	562459	you	1430	" answered the rector : "
562481	562507	562508	562508	I	0	" Mrs. Kenrick left the room to execute her master 's wishes ; and , as she descended the stairs , she thought within herself , "
562528	562724	562508	562508	I	0	" And the good woman experienced a pleasure as sincere as if any one had announced to her that she was entitled to a princely fortune . To send Katherine out of the way for an hour was no difficult matter . The old housekeeper gave her leave to repair to Saint Giles 's to visit her relatives ; and the young girl , thinking that her uncle might repent of his recent harshness towards her , now that she was no longer dependant upon him , gladly availed herself of this permission . Katherine accordingly proceeded to Saint Giles 's ; and the moment she had left the house Mrs. Kenrick spread the kitchen table with the tea - things . Katherine tripped lightly along towards Saint Giles 's ; but as she drew near her uncle 's door , she relaxed her speed , and her heart grew somewhat heavy . She was afraid of experiencing an unkind reception . It was , therefore , with a pleasure the more lively as it was unexpected , that the poor girl found herself welcomed by a smile on the part of her dreaded relative . "
562730	562740	562728	562728	Kate	1413	" said he , when he perceived his niece ; "
562792	562793	562794	562794	I	0	" "
562810	562851	562808	562808	uncle	29368	" said Kate , wiping away a tear , as she followed Smithers into the little parlour , which , somehow or another , did not look so neat as it had been wo nt to do in her time . "
562865	562869	562863	562863	Kate	1413	" continued Smithers . "
562875	562880	562872	562872	I	0	" he added abruptly , "
562897	562898	562872	562872	I	0	" "
562907	562923	562905	562905	uncle	29368	" answered the girl , more and more astonished at this unusual urbanity of manner . "
562938	562947	562929	562929	I'm	0	" said Smithers , after a short pause . "
562959	562960	562957	562957	myself	0	" "
562965	562971	562963	562963	you	29368	" asked Kate , kindly . "
562983	563021	562981	562981	Kate	1413	" returned the public executioner , sinking his voice to a low and mysterious whisper ; but , at the same time , his countenance grew deadly pale , and he cast a shuddering look around him . "
563034	563050	563028	563028	uncle	29368	" said Kate , surveying him attentively — for his peculiarity of manner alarmed her . "
563060	563083	563058	563058	Kate	1413	" continued the executioner ; then , drawing his chair closer towards that on which his niece was seated , he added , "
563090	563091	563092	563092	Your	29368	" "
563101	563102	563099	563099	you	29368	" "
563111	563122	563109	563109	Kate	1413	" proceeded Smithers , in a tone of deep dejection : "
563138	563139	563140	563140	Uncle	29368	" "
563170	563171	563167	563168	a physician	9191	" "
563200	563212	563192	563192	I	0	" continued Smithers , after a few moments of profound reflection . "
563230	563231	563220	563220	I	0	" "
563238	563244	563236	563236	uncle	29368	" said Katherine , hastily . "
563404	563405	563408	563408	uncle	29368	" "
563410	563414	563408	563408	uncle	29368	" answered Katherine ; "
563435	563436	563408	563408	uncle	29368	" "
563445	563450	563451	563451	I	0	" continued the executioner . "
563529	563530	563526	563526	its	15379	" "
563542	563556	563526	563526	its	15379	" said the young girl , casting an involuntary glance of timidity around . "
563573	563580	563562	563571	one of the sort to be deluded by the imagination	15382	" asked Smithers , somewhat contemptuously . "
563600	563601	563562	563571	one of the sort to be deluded by the imagination	15382	" "
563630	563634	563635	563635	I	0	" urged Kate . "
563647	563652	563635	563635	I	0	" persisted the executioner . "
563697	563731	563692	563692	I	0	" Kate made no reply : she saw the inutility of arguing with her uncle upon the subject ; and she was afraid of provoking his irritable temper by contending against his obstinacy . "
563744	563753	563742	563742	Kate	1413	" said the executioner , after a pause . "
563810	563811	563803	563803	I	0	" "
563822	563826	563812	563812	I	0	" answered Kate . "
563833	563834	563835	563837	The young vagabond	15389	" "
563839	563876	563835	563837	The young vagabond	15389	" ejaculated the executioner , whose irritability this question had aroused in spite of the depression of spirits under which he laboured ; for he could not forget the unwearied repugnance which Gibbet manifested towards the paternal avocations:—"the
563890	563891	563880	563880	he	15389	" "
563899	563908	563880	563880	he	15389	" exclaimed Kate , surprised at this information . "
563911	563916	563880	563880	he	15389	" continued the executioner ; "
563928	563929	563922	563922	he	15389	" "
563939	563945	563947	563947	he	15389	" observed the young maiden . "
563974	563975	563954	563954	he	15389	" "
563987	563997	563954	563954	he	15389	" exclaimed Kate , in a tone of disappointment . "
564003	564008	563999	563999	you	1413	" replied the executioner . "
564022	564023	564010	564010	I	0	" "
564034	564042	564032	564032	uncle	29368	" said Katherine , rising to depart . "
564046	564146	564032	564032	uncle	29368	" grumbled the man , some of his old surliness returning . Katherine then took leave of her uncle , and hurried towards Mr. Tracy 's residence . She reached her destination as the clock struck nine , and entered the house as usual , by the back way . She proceeded to the kitchen , where , to her surprise , she observed Mrs. Kenrick sitting in her arm - chair , but apparently fast asleep . The old housekeeper 's arms reposed upon the table , and formed a support for her head which had fallen forwards . "
564149	564153	564162	564162	her	15393	" thought Katherine ; "
564166	564269	564270	564271	My God	27430	" The young maiden moved lightly about the kitchen , while she threw off her bonnet and cloak , for fear of awaking the housekeeper . Then she sate down near the fire , and fell into a profound reverie concerning the strange tale which her uncle had told her . Presently it struck her that she did not hear the housekeeper breathe ; and an awful suspicion rushed like a torrent into her mind . For some moments she sate , motionless and almost breathless , in her chair , with her eyes fixed upon the inclined form of the housekeeper . "
564273	564279	564270	564271	My God	27430	" at length Kate exclaimed ; "
564299	564325	564289	564289	her	15395	" Then , overcoming her terror , the young maiden bent down her head so as to obtain a glimpse of Mrs. Kenrick 's countenance . "
564338	564509	564334	564334	she	15395	" cried the horror - struck girl , as her eyes encountered a livid and ghastly face instead of the healthy and good - humoured one which was familiar to her . And Katherine sank back in her seat , overcome with grief and terror . Suddenly the thought struck her that , after all , the housekeeper might only be in a fit . Blaming herself for the delay which her fears had occasioned ere she administered succour , Kate hastened to raise the old lady 's head . But she let it fall again when she had obtained another glance of that ghastly countenance;—for the eyes were fixed and glazed — the under jaw had fallen — and the swollen tongue was lolling , dark and livid , out of the mouth . Then Kate rushed into the yard , screaming for help . The rector 's groom ( who also acted as coachman ) was in the stable adjoining ; and he immediately hastened to the spot . "
564515	564535	564334	564334	she	15395	" he demanded , alarmed by the wildness of Katherine 's manner and the piercing agony of her cries . "
564541	564548	564536	564537	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" replied Katherine , sobbing bitterly . "
564551	564587	564588	564589	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" ejaculated the man ; and he instantly rushed into the kitchen . In a few moments afterwards the rector made his appearance , and inquired the cause of the screams which had alarmed him . "
564595	564623	564588	564589	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" said the groom . Katherine had flung herself into a chair , and was giving full vent to her grief for the loss of her benefactress . "
564626	564631	564588	564589	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" cried the rector . "
564652	564653	564654	564654	I	0	" "
564664	564688	564662	564662	sir	26649	" said the groom , who had now raised the housekeeper from her procumbent posture , and laid her back in the chair . "
564696	564779	564799	564799	you	26649	" exclaimed the rector impatiently . The groom instantly departed ; and during his short absence the rector was most assiduous in bathing the housekeeper 's forehead with vinegar and water , and chafing her hands between his own . In a few minutes the groom returned , accompanied by a surgeon ; and the rector was found in the midst of his vain attentions . The surgeon 's examination was brief ; but his words were decisive , as he said , "
564795	564796	564799	564799	you	26649	" "
564802	564806	564799	564799	you	26649	" demanded Reginald . "
564813	564818	564808	564809	your servant	27082	" replied the surgeon . "
564821	564826	564799	564799	you	26649	" exclaimed the rector . "
564858	564859	564862	564863	Mr. Tracy	1353	" "
564865	564871	564862	564863	Mr. Tracy	1353	" said the surgeon positively , "
564876	564887	564872	564872	she	27082	" At these words Kate 's sobs became more convulsive . "
564894	564899	564917	564917	I	0	" cried the rector : "
564910	564911	564906	564906	she	27082	" "
564920	564921	564917	564917	I	0	" "
564930	564942	564917	564917	I	0	" exclaimed Reginald Tracy , burying his face in his hands : "
564954	564955	564917	564917	I	0	" "
564958	564971	564917	564917	I	0	" echoed Katherine , starting from her seat , and coming forward : "
565009	565010	564985	564985	She	27082	" "
565023	565028	565019	565021	my poor girl	15408	" said the rector ; "
565054	565112	565113	565113	I	0	" At this moment Thomas returned from his mission to Markham Place . The poor fellow was deeply affected when the dreadful spectacle in the kitchen met his eyes , and when the few particulars yet known concerning the death of the housekeeper , or rather the first discovery of her death — were communicated to him . "
565124	565128	565113	565113	I	0	" exclaimed Thomas , "
565142	565143	565113	565113	I	0	" "
565149	565154	565157	565157	sir	26649	" cried the rector . "
565159	565164	565157	565157	sir	26649	" answered the man ; "
565190	565191	565178	565178	she	27082	" "
565196	565204	565207	565207	sir	26649	" said Reginald , in unfeigned surprise . "
565237	565247	565229	565229	I	0	" rejoined Thomas , wiping away an honest tear . "
565251	565266	565268	565268	you	38012	" said the surgeon , who had been attentively examining Katherine for some moments , "
565276	565277	565278	565278	I	0	" "
565282	565316	565280	565280	sir	26649	" exclaimed the young girl , who was too deeply absorbed in grief at the death of her benefactress to have her ideas very clearly distributed in the proper cells of her brain . "
565319	565324	565361	565361	sir	26649	" continued the surgeon : "
565352	565353	565337	565337	you	38012	" "
565363	565367	565358	565358	I	0	" said Katherine : "
565385	565395	565368	565369	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" The surgeon threw an inquiring glance towards Reginald . "
565399	565404	565368	565369	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" ejaculated the rector . "
565412	565416	565406	565407	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" returned Katherine : "
565432	565433	565425	565425	she	1430	" "
565447	565461	565445	565445	sir	26649	" said the surgeon , with another glance of inquiry towards the rector . "
565469	565476	565479	565479	I	0	" answered Mr. Tracy , calmly : "
565488	565489	565479	565479	I	0	" "
565493	565497	565479	565479	I	0	" ejaculated Thomas ; "
565510	565511	565512	565512	I	0	" "
565517	565524	565512	565512	I	0	" almost shrieked the poor girl : "
565534	565549	565512	565512	I	0	" And she clasped her hands together . The surgeon shook his head mysteriously . "
565553	565567	565568	565568	you	26649	" exclaimed the rector , who was evidently excited to a painful degree , "
565591	565592	565586	565588	this young person	34156	" "
565607	565617	565593	565593	I	0	" observed the surgeon , with true professional calmness . "
565633	565634	565626	565626	she	39575	" "
565650	565655	565626	565626	she	39575	" interrupted the rector . "
565675	565680	565672	565673	Mr. Tracy	1353	" said the surgeon ; "
565709	565710	565687	565687	she	39575	" "
565716	565734	565687	565687	she	39575	" cried the rector , striking his forehead forcibly with the open palm of his right hand . "
565751	565772	565773	565774	Mr. Tracy	1353	" said the surgeon . He then whispered a few words to the groom . The groom immediately went out . "
565788	565801	565778	565778	you	26649	" cried Katherine , in a tone of the most piercing anguish . "
565824	565825	565826	565826	I	0	" "
565830	565833	565834	565834	you	1353	" exclaimed the rector,—"believe
565842	565843	565834	565834	you	1353	" "
565850	565872	565847	565848	Mr. Tracy	1353	" cried the poor girl , falling upon her knees before him , and grasping his hands convulsively in her own . "
565881	565886	565873	565873	You	1353	" muttered the surgeon . "
565904	565905	565908	565908	you	26649	" "
565911	565916	565908	565908	you	26649	" cried the rector . "
565939	565944	565945	565945	You	1353	" he added emphatically . "
565955	565975	565945	565945	You	1353	" returned the surgeon coolly . At this moment the groom returned , followed by a police - officer . "
565989	565994	565976	565977	A person	3238	" said the surgeon ; "
566004	566076	566077	566078	My God	27430	" Then followed one of those heart - rending scenes which defy the powers of the most graphic pen to delineate . Amidst the wildest screams — and with cries of despair which pierced even to the stoic heart of the surgeon , who had acted in a manner which he had deemed merely consistent with his duty , the unhappy girl was led away in the custody of the officer . "
566092	566105	566106	566107	The surgeon	29781	" exclaimed Reginald Tracy , as he precipitated himself from the kitchen . "
566111	566118	566119	566119	master	27070	" observed Thomas to the groom ; "
566135	566183	566184	566185	Mr. Markham	874	" Early on the morning which succeeded the arrest of Katharine Wilmot , Mr. Gregory paid a visit to Markham Place . The moment he entered the room where Richard received him , our hero observed that some deep affliction weighed upon the mind of his friend . "
566187	566199	566184	566185	Mr. Markham	874	" said the latter , in a tone of profound anguish , "
566222	566223	566230	566230	you	26679	" "
566233	566237	566230	566230	you	26679	" exclaimed Richard . "
566243	566244	566230	566230	you	26679	" "
566258	566265	566245	566247	Mary - Anne	1264	" interrupted Mr. Gregory , solemnly . "
566310	566311	566306	566306	I	0	" "
566328	566332	566291	566291	God	880	" answered Markham ; "
566341	566342	566306	566306	I	0	" "
566347	566353	566306	566306	I	0	" said the afflicted father . "
566377	566394	566306	566306	I	0	" There was a pause , during which Mr. Gregory was wrapped up in painful reflections . "
566397	566414	566415	566415	you	15450	" said he , at length breaking that solemn silence , and taking Richard 's hand ; "
566455	566469	566450	566450	herself	1264	" Richard gazed at Mr. Gregory in astonishment as he uttered these words . "
566476	566482	566450	566450	herself	1264	" continued the wretched father ; "
566577	566578	566573	566575	the Lady Isabella	1048	" "
566587	566600	566601	566601	They	15456	" ejaculated Markham , more and more surprised at what he heard . "
566658	566659	566647	566647	they	15456	" "
566669	566673	566647	566647	they	15456	" cried Markham . "
566678	566683	566647	566647	they	15456	" continued Mr. Gregory , "
566728	566729	566730	566730	She	1048	" "
566738	566743	566744	566744	She	1048	" said Markham enthusiastically . "
566758	566763	566744	566744	She	1048	" resumed Mr. Gregory ; "
566865	566883	566886	566886	you	0	" Richard pressed the hand of his respected friend in token of gratitude for this kind wish . "
566899	566904	566886	566886	you	0	" said Mr. Gregory ; "
566916	567066	567075	567075	Richard	874	" Markham instantly prepared himself to accompany the unhappy parent . Few were the words that passed between them as they proceeded to the dwelling which was the abode of sorrow . On their arrival Markham was shown into the drawing - room for a short time ; and then the nurse came to introduce him into the sick - chamber . The room was nearly dark ; the curtains of the bed were close drawn ; and thus the dying girl was completely concealed from our hero . But near the foot of the bed was standing a beauteous form , whose symmetrical shape Markham could not fail to recognise . Isabella extended her hand towards him : he pressed it in silence to his lips . Mary - Anne had heard his footsteps ; and she also gave him her hand between the folds of the curtains . "
567077	567081	567075	567075	Richard	874	" whispered Isabella : "
567092	567161	567082	567084	our poor friend	15473	" And Isabella wept — and Richard also wept ; for those noble - minded beings could not know , without the liveliest emotion , that one so sweet , so innocent , and so youthful , was stretched upon the bed from which she was destined never to rise again . Markham seated himself by the side of the bed ; and Isabella was about to withdraw . "
567170	567221	567082	567084	our poor friend	15473	" said Mary - Anne , in a plaintive but silver tone of voice , which touched a chord of sympathy that vibrated to their very souls . Alas ! that dulcet voice could not move the tuneless ear of Death ! Isabella obeyed her friend 's wish in silence . "
567231	567250	567226	567226	you	874	" continued Mary - Anne , after a brief pause , and now evidently addressing herself to Richard . "
567400	567401	567402	567402	You	874	" "
567411	567430	567402	567402	You	874	" exclaimed Markham , deeply affected , while Isabella 's ill - suppressed sobs fell upon his ears . "
567477	567478	567465	567474	one so young , so innocent , and so beautiful	15486	" "
567481	567514	567465	567474	one so young , so innocent , and so beautiful	15486	" cried Mary - Anne , with a bitterness of accent which surprised our hero , and which served to elicit a fresh burst of sorrow from the sympathising bosom of Isabella : "
567522	567530	567465	567474	one so young , so innocent , and so beautiful	15486	" Then there was another solemn pause . "
567543	567553	567538	567538	you	874	" resumed Mary - Anne , again breaking silence . "
567602	567614	567649	567650	angel Isabella	1048	" continued the young maiden , in a tone of excitement , "
567703	567715	567699	567699	Richard	874	" she said , with a sort of holy enthusiasm and sybilline fervour,—"then
567729	567774	567699	567699	Richard	874	" At that solemn moment , Isabella extended her hand towards Richard , who pressed hers tenderly ; and the lovers thus acknowledged the impression which had been wrought and the happy augury which was conveyed by the fervent language of the dying girl . "
567787	567800	567699	567699	Richard	874	" continued Mary - Anne , in the same tone of inspiration . "
567885	567886	567888	567888	you	874	" "
567890	567900	567888	567888	you	874	" exclaimed Richard and Isabella in the same breath ; "
567905	567914	567888	567888	you	874	" And the tears streamed down their cheeks . "
567921	567927	567888	567888	you	874	" said Mary - Anne ; "
567976	567977	567968	567968	I	0	" "
567988	567992	567968	567968	I	0	" exclaimed Richard . "
568005	568006	568007	568007	My	0	" "
568010	568020	568007	568007	My	0	" repeated the invalid , with an evident shudder . "
568028	568034	568007	568007	My	0	" demanded the young maiden : "
568044	568045	568046	568046	You	874	" "
568050	568054	568046	568046	You	874	" returned Markham : "
568084	568085	568105	568105	you	874	" "
568092	568100	568090	568090	Richard	874	" murmured the soft tones of Isabella ; "
568108	568133	568105	568105	you	874	" At the same time that the Signora thus spoke in a low whisper , deep and convulsive sobs emanated from behind the curtains . "
568141	568154	568137	568139	Mary - Anne	1264	" said Richard , not comprehending the meaning of Isabella 's words ; "
568163	568164	568155	568155	I	0	" "
568173	568178	568167	568167	I	0	" said Miss Gregory ; "
568189	568190	568180	568181	my father	2156	" "
568193	568197	568202	568202	he	2156	" echoed Richard . "
568206	568207	568209	568209	he	2156	" "
568226	568227	568231	568231	He	2156	" "
568294	568295	568285	568285	I	0	" "
568298	568313	568285	568285	I	0	" said Mary - Anne , in a faint and deeply - melancholy tone , "
568364	568365	568415	568415	Isabella	1048	" "
568371	568378	568415	568415	Isabella	1048	" cried Markham with a shudder . "
568384	568390	568415	568415	Isabella	1048	" repeated Mary - Anne . "
568422	568423	568415	568415	Isabella	1048	" "
568429	568434	568435	568435	I	0	" answered our hero : "
568449	568453	568454	568454	I	0	" he added , "
568470	568471	568472	568472	You	874	" "
568476	568482	568472	568472	You	874	" said the dying girl , "
568569	568570	568551	568551	I	0	" "
568573	568578	568551	568551	I	0	" echoed our hero : "
568589	568590	568586	568586	you	874	" "
568606	568617	568586	568586	you	874	" returned the young lady , with a deep sigh . "
568693	568701	568688	568688	I	0	" continued Mary - Anne , bitterly ; "
568720	568721	568707	568707	I	0	" "
568738	568758	568707	568707	I	0	" said Richard , deeply afflicted by the tone , the manner , and the communications of the invalid ; "
568784	568785	568781	568782	a surgeon	31889	" "
568790	568848	568781	568782	a surgeon	31889	" cried Mary - Anne , convulsively ; and , taking Richard 's hand , she carried it to her countenance . She placed his fingers upon her closed eye - lids . He touched them ; they yielded to his pressure . The sockets of the eyes were empty . The eye - balls were gone ! "
568869	568880	568932	568933	the Almighty	4958	" exclaimed our hero , unable to contain his emotions . "
568889	568895	568932	568933	the Almighty	4958	" said Mary - Anne . "
568972	569001	569004	569004	your	0	" Markham made no answer ; and during the long silence which ensued , the dying girl was wrapt up in mental devotion . At length she said , "
569014	569049	569004	569004	your	0	" Her voice had now lost all its excitement ; and her utterance was slow and languid . The lovers obeyed her desire . Mary - Anne placed their hands together , and said , "
569060	569068	569004	569004	your	0	" Richard and Isabella both wept plentifully . "
569078	569084	569085	569085	You	0	" murmured Mary - Anne . "
569105	569106	569093	569094	my father	2156	" "
569120	569132	569110	569112	Mary - Anne	1264	" said Isabella , in a tone expressive of deep emotion . "
569141	569180	569110	569112	Mary - Anne	1264	" added Richard . He then led the weeping Isabella from the apartment . As they issued from the chamber of death , they met Mr. Gregory in the passage : he wrung their hands , and said , "
569191	569269	569110	569112	Mary - Anne	1264	" The unhappy parent then repaired to the death - bed of his daughter . Markham and Isabella proceeded in silence to the drawing - room . The scene , which they had just witnessed , produced a most painful impression upon the minds of the lovely Italian lady and Richard Markham . For some moments after they were alone in the drawing - room together , they maintained a profound silence . At length Richard spoke . "
569286	569290	569284	569284	Isabella	1048	" he said . "
569303	569307	569284	569284	Isabella	1048	" answered Isabella , "
569326	569327	569320	569320	my	0	" "
569332	569336	569320	569320	my	0	" ejaculated Markham . "
569358	569359	569360	569360	I	0	" "
569371	569375	569360	569360	I	0	" returned Isabella ; "
569398	569399	569387	569387	you,—apart	15523	" "
569442	569443	569444	569444	Richard	874	" "
569493	569494	569481	569483	Mary - Anne	1264	" "
569501	569505	569481	569483	Mary - Anne	1264	" answered Markham . "
569536	569550	569529	569529	Isabella	1048	" The Princess tendered him her hand , which he kissed in rapture . "
569555	569566	569529	569529	Isabella	1048	" said Isabella , after a few moments ' silence , "
569614	569615	569616	569616	I	0	" "
569647	569648	569644	569645	the soldiery	15531	" "
569651	569655	569644	569645	the soldiery	15531	" answered Isabella ; "
569754	569755	569776	569777	General Grachia	1187	" "
569762	569766	569776	569777	General Grachia	1187	" remarked Richard . "
569770	569774	569776	569777	General Grachia	1187	" continued Isabella , "
569861	569862	569848	569849	the Duke	26690	" "
569881	569885	569877	569879	his Prime Minister	15548	" observed Richard . "
569888	569892	569877	569879	his Prime Minister	15548	" answered Isabella . "
569935	569936	569929	569930	General Grachia	1187	" "
569941	569945	569929	569930	General Grachia	1187	" ejaculated Markham . "
569957	569958	569963	569963	he	26690	" "
569967	569971	569963	569963	he	26690	" continued Isabella , "
570073	570086	570087	570087	I	0	" Isabella produced the newspaper , and , opening it , said , "
570095	570096	570087	570087	I	0	" "
570108	570112	570101	570101	me	0	" returned Markham . "
570121	570126	570087	570087	I	0	" exclaimed the Signora . "
570136	570140	570128	570128	I	0	" said Richard . "
570153	570154	570128	570128	I	0	" "
570171	570175	570128	570128	I	0	" interrupted Richard : "
570221	570301	570302	570303	ANGELO III	1189	" The lovely Italian girl listened to this announcement with the most tender interest . She received it as a proof of boundless love for her ; and sweet — ineffably sweet was the glance of deep gratitude which she threw upon her lover . Richard took the Montoni Gazette from the fair hand which tendered it to him , and then read , with ease and fluency , the following translation of the ducal ordinance alluded to : — "
570317	570327	570328	570328	We	15564	" To all present and to come , Greeting : "
570339	570375	570328	570328	We	15564	" I. The censorship of the press is restored from this date : and no newspaper nor periodical work shall be published in our dominions , without the consent of the Minister of the Interior . "
570421	570457	570460	570460	Our	15564	" III . No assembly of more than seven persons will henceforth be allowed to take place , without the consent of the local authorities , save for the purposes of religious worship and ceremonial . "
570488	570511	570513	570515	the Grand Duke	1085	" V. Our Minister Secretary of State for the Department of the Interior will see to the execution of this our ordinance . "
570520	570524	570517	570518	ANGELO III	1189	" RAPALLO PISANI , "
570530	570536	570517	570518	ANGELO III	1189	" January 10th , 1840 . "
570537	570566	570568	570568	Richard	874	" The Grand Duke has thus destroyed the freedom of the press , promulgated a law to suppress political meetings , and menaced the country with martial law , "
570580	570599	570601	570601	Isabella	1066	" And it would appear , by the newspapers and by private letters which my father has received , "
570603	570649	570601	570601	Isabella	1066	" that the Grand Duke would have proceeded to extremes far more dangerous to his throne had not his amiable Duchess softened him . But even her intercessions — and I understand she is a most deserving princess — were ineffectual in a great measure . "
570650	570660	570662	570662	Markham	874	" Know you the results of that despotic ordinance ? "
570664	570673	570675	570676	the Signora	5333	" Several riots have taken place at Montoni , "
570678	570700	570675	570676	the Signora	5333	" and the Captain - General of the province of Abrantani has proclaimed martial law throughout the districts which he governs . "
570701	570710	570712	570712	Richard	874	" Matters are then becoming serious in Castelcicala , "
570714	570722	570712	570712	Richard	874	" What has become of General Grachia ? "
570723	570764	570765	570765	she	5333	" No one knows . He left Montoni within twenty - four hours after the receipt of the decree of exile ; but my father has received no information of his progress or intentions . Oh ! my beloved country , "
570775	570795	570765	570765	she	5333	" may God grant that thou wilt not be the scene of anarchy , bloodshed , and civil strife ! "
570969	571000	570956	570957	Mr. Gregory	1261	" She is gone — she died in my arms ! Almost her last words were , ' Tell Isabella and Richard sometimes to think of Mary - Anne . ' "
571039	571042	571044	571045	Mr. Gregory	1261	" Richard , "
571052	571105	571044	571045	Mr. Gregory	1261	" you must write to my sons and tell them of this sad affliction . Desire them to return home immediately from college : I was wrong not to have sent for them before ; but — my God ! I knew not that my sweet child 's death was so near ! "
571236	571249	571251	571251	Ellen	1117	" Mr. Tracy 's footman has been here with very disagreeable news , "
571262	571280	571251	571251	Ellen	1117	" Had I known whither you were gone , I should have directed him on to you . "
571281	571287	571289	571289	Richard	874	" Mr. Tracy 's footman ! "
571291	571319	571289	571289	Richard	874	" Why — he was here last evening , with a letter from his master inviting me and Mr. Monroe to dine with him next Monday — — "
571320	571327	571329	571329	Ellen	1117	" I am aware of it , "
571331	571338	571329	571329	Ellen	1117	" And you declined the invitation . "
571339	571349	571351	571351	Richard	874	" Yes — because I do not seek society , "
571353	571372	571351	571351	Richard	874	" I wrote a proper answer : what , then , did his servant require to - day ? "
571373	571388	571329	571329	Ellen	1117	" It appears that a young person in whom you felt some interest — — "
571389	571393	571395	571395	Richard	874	" Katherine Wilmot ? "
571397	571403	571395	571395	Richard	874	" That is the name , "
571407	571412	571414	571415	our hero	5194	" What about her ? "
571417	571425	571414	571415	our hero	5194	" She has committed a crime — — "
571426	571430	571329	571329	Ellen	1117	" A crime ! "
571431	571447	571414	571415	our hero	5194	" A crime of the blackest dye : she has poisoned Mr. Tracy 's housekeeper . "
571448	571462	571464	571464	Markham	874	" Ellen you are deceived — you are mistaken : it is impossible ! "
571466	571537	571464	571464	Markham	874	" I never saw her but once , it is true : and still the impression she made upon me was most favourable . I did not mention any thing concerning her to either you or your father , because I sought to do an act of humanity in tearing her away from a wretched home ; and I am not one who speaks of such a deed as that . "
571538	571551	571553	571553	Ellen	1117	" I am not deceived — I am not mistaken , Richard , "
571555	571589	571590	571590	Ellen	1117	" The footman came and narrated to me the particulars ; and he said that his master was too unwell , through horror and excitement , to write to you upon the subject . "
571630	571641	571642	571642	he	874	" If that innocent - looking girl be a murderess , "
571647	571672	571642	571642	he	874	" I shall never put faith in human appearances again . But , until she be proved guilty , I will not desert her . "
571673	571678	571680	571680	Ellen	1117	" Do you know , "
571682	571721	571680	571680	Ellen	1117	" that I do not like your Mr. Tracy at all ! Not that I suppose him capable of falsely accusing any one of so heinous a crime as murder ; but — I do not like him . "
571722	571729	571731	571731	Richard	874	" A female caprice , Ellen , "
571733	571741	571642	571642	he	874	" The world in general adores him . "
571742	571759	571761	571761	Ellen	1117	" Ah ! those who stand upon the highest pinnacles often experience the most signal falls , "
571763	571775	571777	571777	Richard	874	" The breath of calumny has never tainted his fair fame , "
571779	571794	571777	571777	Richard	874	" Alas ! we have so many — many instances of profound ecclesiastical hypocrisy , "
571799	571808	571810	571810	Markham	874	" Ellen , you wrong an excellent man , "
571815	571840	571810	571810	Markham	874	" I will call upon him to - morrow morning , and learn from his own lips the particulars of this most mysterious deed . "
573826	573838	573819	573819	her	15721	" Mr. Markham , I am innocent — I am innocent ! "
573839	573857	573859	573859	Richard	874	" So I choose to believe you — unless a jury should pronounce you to be guilty , "
573861	573866	573867	573867	he	874	" and even then , "
573875	573888	573867	573867	he	874	" it is possible — I mean that juries are not infallible . "
573889	573906	573908	573908	Katherine	1413	" Oh ! Mr. Markham , I am most unfortunate — and very , very unhappy ! "
573917	573940	573908	573908	Katherine	1413	" I have never injured a human being — and yet , see where I am ! see how I am treated ! "
574036	574048	574050	574050	Katherine	1413	" It is not death that I fear , Mr. Markham , "
574056	574191	574050	574050	Katherine	1413	" but it is hard — very hard to be accused of a crime which I abhor ! No — I do not fear death : perhaps it would be better for me to die even at my age — than dwell in a world which has no charms for me . For I have been unhappy from my birth , Mr. Markham : I was left an orphan when I was young — so very young — oh ! too young to lose both parents ! Since then my existence has not been blest ; and at the very moment when a brighter destiny seemed opened to me , through the goodness of yourself and Mr. Tracy , I am suddenly snatched away to a prison , and overwhelmed with this terrible accusation ! "
574192	574195	574197	574197	Richard	874	" Katherine , "
574210	574231	574197	574197	Richard	874	" I believe you to be innocent — as God is my judge , I believe you to be innocent ! "
574232	574245	574247	574247	Katherine	1413	" And may that same Almighty Power bless you for this assurance ! "
574260	574272	574274	574274	Richard	874	" Although in asserting my conviction of your innocence , Katherine , "
574276	574304	574274	574274	Richard	874	" I leave the deed itself enveloped in the darkest mystery , still I do believe that you are innocent — and I will not desert you . "
574318	574324	574325	574326	Thomas Armstrong	882	" I believe that you are innocent,"—when
574335	574348	574349	574349	he	874	" Yes , Katherine — you are , you must be innocent , "
574352	574393	574349	574349	he	874	" and I will labour unceasingly to make your innocence apparent . I will provide the ablest counsel to assist in your defence ; and all that human agency can effect in your behalf shall be ensured at any cost . "
574440	574449	574450	574450	he	15734	" Has your uncle been to see you ? "
574453	574462	574464	574464	Katherine	1413	" No , sir — nor my cousin , "
574474	574508	574509	574509	He	15734	" Perhaps they are unaware of your situation . I will call and communicate to them the sad tidings . As your relatives , it is right that they should know the truth . "
574617	574629	574631	574632	the man	2092	" It 's no use knocking and knocking there , sir , "
574634	574751	574631	574632	the man	2092	" Smithers and his lad left London early yesterday morning for some place in the north of Ireland — I do n't know the name — but where there 's some work in his partickler line . The postman brought Smithers a letter , asking him to start off without delay ; and he did so . He took Gibbet with him to give him another chance , he said , of trying his hand . Smithers told me all this before he went away , and asked me to take in any letters that might come for him , or answer any one that called . That 's how I came to know all this . "
574752	574764	574766	574766	Richard	874	" Do you happen to be aware when he will return ? "
574768	574779	574781	574782	the man	2092	" I 've no more idea than that there tater , "
574864	574893	574848	574848	Markham	874	" You have doubtless heard of the extraordinary position in which poor Katherine Wilmot is placed . I , for one , firmly believe her to be innocent . "
574894	574901	574903	574904	the officer	2833	" So do I , sir , "
574908	574925	574927	574927	Richard	874	" Then you will prove the more useful to my purposes in consequence of that impression , "
574929	574978	574927	574927	Richard	874	" When I saw you on a former occasion , you offered me your services if ever I should require them . Little did I then suppose that I should so soon need your aid . Are you willing to assist me in investigating this most mysterious affair ? "
574979	574990	574992	574992	Benstead	1415	" With pleasure , sir — with the sincerest pleasure , "
574994	575005	574992	574992	Benstead	1415	" You know the respect I entertain for Miss Kate . "
575006	575015	575017	575018	our hero	5194	" And I know your goodness of heart , "
575020	575105	575017	575018	our hero	5194	" You must then aid me in collecting proofs of her innocence . Spare no expense in your task : hesitate not to apply to me for any money that you may need . Here are ten pounds for immediate purposes . To - morrow I will let you know whom I shall decide upon employing to conduct the poor girl 's defence ; and you can then communicate direct with the solicitor and barrister retained . Are you willing to undertake this task ? "
575106	575114	575116	575117	the policeman	27346	" Need you ask me , sir ? "
575119	575130	575116	575117	the policeman	27346	" I would do any thing to serve Miss Kate . "
575131	575150	575152	575152	Richard	874	" Prudence renders it necessary for me to keep myself in the back - ground in this affair , "
575154	575194	575152	575152	Richard	874	" for fear lest scandal should attach an unworthy motive to my exertions in her behalf , and thus prejudice her cause by injuring her character . Upon you , then , I throw the weight of the investigation . "
575195	575202	575204	575204	Benstead	1415	" And I accept it cheerfully , "
575395	575410	575412	575413	the Italian	33343	" The object of my visit is of a most important and solemn nature , "
575415	575433	575412	575413	the Italian	33343	" and you will excuse me if I open my business by asking you a few questions . "
575434	575444	575482	575483	the Italian	33343	" This is certainly a strange mode of proceeding , "
575449	575476	575482	575483	the Italian	33343	" but you are aware that I must reserve to myself the right of replying or not to your queries , as I may think fit . "
575477	575480	575482	575483	the Italian	33343	" Undoubtedly , "
575485	575525	575482	575483	the Italian	33343	" But I am a man of honour ; and should our interview progress as favourably as I hope , I shall entrust you with secrets which will prove my readiness to look upon you in the same light . "
575526	575529	575531	575531	Richard	874	" Proceed , "
575533	575538	575531	575531	Richard	874	" you speak fairly . "
575539	575566	575482	575483	the Italian	33343	" In the first place , am I right in believing that you were once most intimate with a certain Count Alteroni who resides near Richmond ? "
575567	575571	575573	575573	Richard	874	" Quite right , "
575575	575591	575573	575573	Richard	874	" Do you , or do you not , entertain good feelings towards that nobleman ? "
575592	575607	575609	575610	our hero	5194	" The best feelings — the most sincere friendship — the most devoted attachment , "
575612	575624	575609	575610	our hero	5194	" Are you aware of any particulars in his political history ? "
575625	575635	575573	575573	Richard	874	" He is a refugee from his native land . "
575636	575645	575609	575610	our hero	5194	" Does he now bear his true name ? "
575646	575657	575659	575659	Richard	874	" If you wish me to place confidence in you , "
575661	575681	575609	575610	our hero	5194	" you will yourself answer me one question , before I reply to any farther interrogatory on your part . "
575682	575685	575573	575573	Richard	874	" Speak , "
575691	575720	575722	575722	Richard	874	" Do you wish to propose to me any thing whereby I can manifest my attachment to Count Alteroni , without injury to my own character or honour ? "
575724	575728	575730	575731	the stranger	2298	" I do , "
575734	575745	575730	575731	the stranger	2298	" You can render Count Alteroni great and signal services . "
575746	575767	575769	575769	Richard	874	" I will then as frankly admit to you that I am acquainted with all which relates to Count Alteroni , "
575779	575790	575792	575793	the stranger	2298	" With all which relates to Prince Alberto of Castelcicala ? "
575800	575807	575792	575793	the stranger	2298	" Do we understand each other ? "
575808	575826	575828	575828	Richard	874	" So far that we are equally well acquainted with the affairs of his Highness the Prince , "
575830	575840	575842	575843	the foreigner	15762	" Right . You have heard of General Grachia ? "
575845	575854	575842	575843	the foreigner	15762	" He is also an exile from Castelcicala , "
575858	575864	575866	575867	the foreigner	15762	" He is in England , "
575869	575900	575866	575867	the foreigner	15762	" I had the honour to be his chief aide - de - camp , when he filled the post of Minister of War ; and I am Colonel Morosino . "
575911	575915	575917	575917	Morosino	1442	" General Grachia , "
575919	576068	575917	575917	Morosino	1442	" reached England two days ago . His amiable family is at Geneva . The general visited Prince Alberto yesterday , and had a long conversation with his Highness upon the situation of affairs in Castelcicala . The Grand Duke is endeavouring to establish a complete despotism , and to enslave the country . One province has already been placed under martial law ; and several executions have taken place in Montoni itself . The only crime of the victims was a demand for a Constitution . General Grachia represented to his Highness Prince Alberto the necessity of taking up arms in defence of the liberties of the Castelcicalans against the encroachments of despotism . The reply of the Prince was disheartening to his friends and partizans . ' Under no pretence , ' said he , ' would I kindle civil war in my native country . ' "
576069	576077	576079	576079	Richard	874	" He possesses a truly generous soul , "
576081	576091	576093	576094	the Colonel	30185	" He is so afraid of being deemed selfish , "
576096	576148	576093	576094	the Colonel	30185	" and no one can do otherwise than admire that delicacy and forbearance which shrink from the idea of even appearing to act in accordance with his own personal interests . The Prince has every thing to gain from a successful civil war : hence he will not countenance that extremity . "
576149	576158	576160	576160	Markham	874	" And what does General Grachia now propose ? "
576162	576231	576253	576253	Markham	874	" You are aware that when Prince Alberto was exiled from Castelcicala for having openly proclaimed his opinions in favour of a Constitution and of the extension of the popular liberties , numbers of his supporters in those views were banished with him . We know that there can not be less than two thousand Castelcicalan refugees in Paris and London . Do you begin to comprehend me ? "
576232	576251	576253	576253	Markham	874	" I fear that you meditate proceedings which are opposed to the wishes of his Highness Prince Alberto , "
576255	576291	576253	576253	Markham	874	" The friends of Castelcicalan freedom can undertake what in them would be recognised as pure patriotism , but which in Prince Alberto would be deemed the result of his own personal interests or ambition . "
576292	576295	576297	576297	Richard	874	" True , "
576299	576305	576297	576297	Richard	874	" the distinction is striking . "
576306	576372	576253	576253	Markham	874	" The Prince , moreover , in the audience which he accorded to General Grachia yesterday evening , used these memorable words:—'Were I less than I am , I would consent to take up arms in defence of the liberties of Castelcicala ; but , being as I am , I never will take a step which the world would unanimously attribute to selfishness . ' "
576373	576379	576381	576381	Markham	874	" Those were noble sentiments ! "
576383	576392	576381	576381	Markham	874	" well worthy of him who uttered them . "
576393	576408	576410	576411	Colonel Morosino	1442	" And worthy of serving as rules and suggestions for the patriots of Castelcicala ! "
576413	576422	576423	576423	he	1442	" There are certain times , Mr. Markham , "
576426	576468	576423	576423	he	1442	" when it becomes a duty to take up arms against a sovereign who forgets his duty towards his subjects . Men are not born to be slaves ; and they are bound to resist those who attempt to enslave them . "
576469	576486	576488	576488	Richard	874	" Those words have often been uttered by a deceased friend of mine — Thomas Armstrong , "
576490	576498	576500	576501	the Colonel	30185	" Thomas Armstrong was a true philanthropist , "
576503	576544	576500	576501	the Colonel	30185	" and were he alive now , he would tell you that subjects who take up arms against a bad prince are as justified in so doing as the prince himself could be in punishing those who violate the laws . "
576545	576550	576552	576552	Richard	874	" In plain terms , "
576554	576571	576552	576552	Richard	874	" General Grachia intends to espouse the popular cause against the tyranny of the Grand Duke ? "
576572	576578	576580	576581	Colonel Morosino	1442	" Such is his resolution , "
576583	576608	576552	576552	Richard	874	" And now that you have heard all these particulars , you will probably listen with attention to the objects of my present visit . "
576609	576615	576617	576617	Richard	874	" Proceed , Colonel Morosino , "
576619	576648	576662	576663	the officer	2833	" You must be well aware that , as one well attached to his Highness Prince Alberto , I can not be otherwise than interested in these communications . "
576649	576660	576662	576663	the officer	2833	" I shall condense my remarks as much as possible , "
576665	576762	576764	576764	Morosino	1442	" General Grachia purports to enter into immediate relations with the Castelcicalans now in London and Paris . Of course the strictest secresy is required . The eventual object will be to purchase two or three small ships which may take on board , at different points , those who choose to embark in the enterprise ; and these ships will have a common rendezvous . When united , they will sail for Castelcicala . A descent upon that territory would be welcomed with enthusiasm by nine - tenths of the population ; and the result , "
576768	576789	576662	576663	the officer	2833	whisper,—"the inevitable result must be the dethronement of the Grand Duke and the elevation of Alberto to the sovereign seat . "
576790	576801	576803	576803	Markham	874	" That the project is practicable , I can believe , "
576805	576831	576803	576803	Markham	874	" that it is just , I am also disposed to admit . But do you not think that a bloodless revolution might be effected ? "
576832	576852	576662	576663	the officer	2833	" We hope that we shall be enabled successfully to assert the popular cause without the loss of life , "
576856	576876	576662	576663	the officer	2833	" But this can only be done by means of an imposing force , and not by mere negotiation . "
576877	576892	576894	576894	Markham	874	" You consider the Grand Duke to be so wedded to his despotic system ? "
576897	576924	576926	576927	the Colonel	30185	" What hope can we experience from so obstinate a sovereign , and so servile an administration as that of which Signor Pisani is the chief ? "
576929	576977	576926	576927	the Colonel	30185	" And surely you must allow that patriotism must not have too much patience . By allowing despots to run their race too long , they grow hardened and will then resist to the last , at the sacrifice of thousands of lives and millions of treasure . "
576978	576988	576990	576990	Richard	874	" Such is , alas ! the sad truth , "
576992	577010	576990	576990	Richard	874	" At the same time a fearful responsibility attaches itself to those who kindle a civil war . "
577011	577021	577023	577024	the Colonel	30185	" Civil wars are excited by two distinct motives , "
577026	577072	577084	577084	Markham	874	" In one instance they are produced by the ambition of aspirants to power : in the other , they take their origin in the just wrath of a people driven to desperation by odious tyranny and wrong . The latter is a sacred cause . "
577073	577082	577084	577084	Markham	874	" Yes — and a most just one , "
577086	577112	577084	577084	Markham	874	" If then , I admit that your projects ought to be carried forward , in what way can my humble services be rendered available ? "
577113	577122	577124	577125	Colonel Morosino	1442	" I will explain this point to you , "
577127	577312	577124	577125	Colonel Morosino	1442	" General Grachia , myself , and several stanch advocates of constitutional freedom , met to deliberate last evening upon the course to be pursued , after the General had returned from his interview with the Prince at Richmond . We sat in deliberation until a very late hour ; and we adopted the outline of the plans already explained to you . We then recognised the necessity of having the co - operation of some intelligent , honourable , and enlightened Englishman to aid us in certain departments of our preliminary arrangements . We must raise considerable sums of money upon certain securities which we possess ; we must ascertain to what extent the laws of this country will permit our meetings , or be calculated to interfere with the progress of our measures ; we must purchase ships ostensibly for commercial purposes ; and we must adopt great precautions in procuring from outfitters the arms , clothing , and stores which we shall require . In all these proceedings we require the counsel and aid of an Englishman of honour and integrity . "
577313	577319	577321	577321	Richard	874	" Proceed , Colonel Morosino , "
577330	577568	577325	577327	the Italian officer	15785	" We then found ourselves at a loss where to look for such a confidential auxiliary and adviser ; when one of our assembly spoke in this manner:—'I came to this country , as you well know , at the same time as his Highness the Prince . From that period until the present day I have frequently seen his Highness ; and I became aware of the acquaintance which subsisted between his Highness and an English gentleman of the name of Richard Markham , who was introduced to his Highness by the late Thomas Armstrong . I am also aware that a misunderstanding arose between the Prince and Mr. Markham : the nature of that misunderstanding I never learnt ; but I am aware that , even while it existed , Richard Markham behaved in the most noble manner in a temporary difficulty in which his Highness was involved . I also know that the motives which led to that misunderstanding have been completely cleared away , and that the Prince now speaks in the highest terms of Mr. Richard Markham . Address yourselves , then , to Mr. Markham : he is a man of honour ; and with him your secret is safe , even if he should decline to meet your views . '—Thus spoke our friend last night ; and now the cause and object of my visit are explained to you . "
577569	577593	577595	577595	Richard	874	" You have spoken with a candour and frankness which go far to conquer any scruples that I might entertain in assisting you , "
577597	577663	577665	577665	Richard	874	" At the same time , so important a matter demands mature consideration . Should I consent to accept the office with which you seek to honour me , I should not be a mere lukewarm agent : I should enter heart and soul into your undertaking ; nor should I content myself with simply succouring you in an administrative capacity . Oh ! no , "
577675	577699	577670	577670	he	874	" I would accompany you on your expedition when the time came , and I would bear arms in your most righteous cause . "
577700	577705	577707	577708	the Colonel	30185	" Generous young man ! "
577720	577741	577707	577708	the Colonel	30185	" God grant that your answer may be favourable to us . But pray delay not in announcing your decision . "
577742	577759	577761	577761	Markham	874	" This time to - morrow evening I will be prepared to give you an answer , "
577772	577782	577763	577764	The Colonel	30185	" To - morrow evening I will call again . "
577859	577882	577851	577852	the Prince	6244	" Were I less than I am , I would consent to take up arms in defence of the liberties of Castelcicala . "
577933	577951	577952	577952	he	874	" Oh ! if I could but achieve some deed that would render me worthy of Isabella , "
577955	578013	577952	577952	he	874	" how should I bless the day when I adopted the cause of those brave exiles who now seek my aid ! Yes — I will join them , heart and soul ; and in me they shall have no lukewarm supporter ! The die is cast;—and this resolution must either make or mar me for ever ! "
578210	578213	578192	578195	friends with smiling countenances	15802	" Your Highness "
578215	578218	578192	578195	friends with smiling countenances	15802	" My Lord "
578240	578247	578248	578248	he	874	" A dream — a dream ! "
578265	578277	578248	578248	he	874	" but will the most happy episode therein ever be fulfilled ? "
578381	578385	578387	578388	the Colonel	30185	" Mr. Markham , "
578402	578410	578387	578388	the Colonel	30185	" have you made up your mind ? "
578411	578415	578417	578417	Richard	874	" I have , "
578424	578430	578417	578417	Richard	874	" And your decision — — "
578431	578464	578466	578466	Richard	874	" Is to join you , heart and soul — to throw myself with enthusiasm into your cause — to co - operate with you as if I were a Castelcicalan subject , "
578494	578507	578509	578510	Colonel Morosino	1442	" I am no prophet , if you ever repent this decision , "
578518	578533	578509	578510	Colonel Morosino	1442	" Will you now permit me to introduce a gentleman who has accompanied me ? "
578534	578539	578541	578541	Markham	874	" With much pleasure , "
578587	578591	578593	578594	the Colonel	30185	" Mr. Markham , "
578596	578607	578593	578594	the Colonel	30185	" may you soon become better acquainted with General Grachia . "
578622	578636	578608	578609	The veteran	15815	" I rejoice to find that your decision is favourable to our views . "
578637	578653	578655	578655	Markham	874	" You will also find that I shall be zealous and unwearied in your service , "
578657	578661	578663	578664	General Grachia	1187	" Our proceedings , "
578666	578685	578663	578664	General Grachia	1187	" must be conducted with caution , so that no rumour prejudicial to our measures may reach Castelcicala . "
578686	578694	578696	578696	Markham	874	" I believe it to be understood , "
578698	578747	578696	578696	Markham	874	" that should the Grand Duke change his policy to such an extent that the Castelcicalans may obtain their just rights and privileges by means of his concessions , before our own projects shall be ripe for execution,—that , in this case , we at once abandon them . "
578748	578751	578753	578754	General Grachia	1187	" Assuredly , "
578756	578852	578853	578854	The General	33197	" God knows the purity of my motives , and that I would not plunge my country into civil war without the pressure of a dire necessity . Neither am I adopting extreme measures from vindictive motives because the Grand Duke has banished me not only from office but also from the territory . Had I assented to his despotic decrees I might have retained my high position in the cabinet , and aggrandized my own fortunes at the same time . As a proof of my integrity , Mr. Markham , read this document . "
578875	578892	578895	578895	he	33197	" To His Excellency General Grachia , Minister Secretary of State for the Department of War . "
578975	578987	578989	578990	General Grachia	1187	" To this letter I replied by sending in my resignation , "
578992	579009	578989	578990	General Grachia	1187	" and thus I wrecked my own fortunes , and made my wife and children exiles . "
579010	579020	579022	579022	Markham	874	" You acted nobly — like a true patriot , "
579030	579063	579022	579022	Markham	874	" If for one instant I entertained a scruple in embracing your cause , it is now annihilated ; for you have honoured me with the most convincing proofs of your patriotism . "
579064	579072	579074	579075	the General	33197	" I served the Grand Duke faithfully , "
579077	579266	579074	579075	the General	33197	" and I can not reproach myself for any measure which I ever recommended to his Serene Highness . Although deeply attached to Prince Alberto , I did not oppose the marriage of the Grand Duke ; because I believed that , upon principle , sovereigns are entitled to as much freedom in affairs so nearly touching their domestic happiness , as any of their subjects . I saw in the present Grand Duchess an amiable lady ; and I knew that she was a virtuous one from the strong recommendations which she received from his Highness Prince Alberto and the Earl of Warrington to myself and my family . I supported , then , that marriage upon principle — upon a conviction which I entertain . I believe that sovereigns have a right to consult their own happiness in marriage ; but I never will admit that they have a right to enslave their subjects . I will maintain the privileges of princes , when I consider them encroached upon by the people : with equal readiness will I protect the people against the tyranny of princes . "
579283	579302	579277	579277	he	874	" How blind sovereigns often seem to the merits and honesty of those who would counsel them wisely ! "
579303	579311	579313	579314	Colonel Morosino	1442	" Such is too frequently the case , "
579316	579329	579331	579349	General Grachia:—"one of the most humble , but not the least sincere , of those refugees who support us	40269	" The plan upon which I propose to act is simply this , "
579332	579508	579277	579277	he	874	Grachia:—"one of the most humble , but not the least sincere , of those refugees who support us , will take a house in London in his own name ; and there shall our head - quarters be fixed . There shall we hold our meetings ; and thence will our correspondence be expedited to those whom we can trust , and on whose support we can rely . In order to avoid all cause of suspicion , I shall take a house for myself and suite at the West End , where I shall , however , lead a comparatively secluded life . Fortunately , the greater portion of my property consisted in money in the public funds of Castelcicala ; and for that I obtained securities which may be easily realised in London . My friend Morosino stands in the same position . Between us we can muster some twenty thousand pounds ; and other exiles , who are favourable to our views , can throw ten thousand more into the common stock . "
579509	579522	579524	579524	Richard	874	" To which I shall also be permitted to contribute my quota , "
579526	579535	579537	579538	General Grachia	1187	" Not if we can manage without it , "
579540	579558	579537	579538	General Grachia	1187	" and I have no doubt that pecuniary resources will not be wanting in this good cause . "
579944	579948	579936	579936	Katherine	1413	" Not Guilty . "
579972	580262	579968	579969	Henry Massey	1445	" I am a surgeon , and reside in Great Coram Street . One evening , early in February , a young female came to my shop and purchased two ounces of laudanum . She brought no phial with her . I gave it to her in a phial of my own , which I labelled Poison . On the following evening I was summoned to the house of the Rev. Mr. Tracy . I was introduced into the kitchen , where I found the deceased lying back in her chair quite dead . A young female was there ; and I recognised her to be the one who had purchased the poison at my shop . She is the prisoner at the bar . From this circumstance and others which transpired , I suspected her to have poisoned the deceased ; and I had her given into custody . The Rev. Mr. Tracy was in the kitchen when I arrived . He was doing all he could to recover the deceased . He was deeply affected . On the following day I examined the deceased , and found that she had died by poison . That poison was laudanum . I discovered so large a quantity in her , by the usual tests , that she must have experienced a deep lethargy almost immediately after taking the poison , and could not have lived many minutes . I can not say that she did not take it voluntarily , and with the object of committing suicide . There was nothing upon the table near her — no cup , glass , nor any drinking vessel . The phial produced is the one in which I sold the poison . "
580267	580526	580263	580264	Thomas Parker	1446	" I am footman to the Rev. Mr. Tracy . On the morning of the day when the housekeeper was poisoned , I overheard a conversation between her and Katherine Wilmot . The deceased informed Katherine that she must leave the house , but would not assign any reason . The deceased , however , said that she would provide for Katherine at a sister 's in the country . Katherine objected to leave London , because her relations live here . I thought Mrs. Kenrick was jealous of Katherine , and wished to get rid of her . I mean that deceased thought that Katherine would perhaps be entrusted to fulfil some of her duties as housekeeper . I came out of the pantry , where I was cleaning the plate , and observed that I supposed Mrs. Kenrick was jealous of Katherine . The housekeeper cut the matter short by saying that Katherine should leave . Katherine was very miserable all day afterwards . In the evening my master sent me with a letter to a gentleman at Holloway . When I came back , I found the housekeeper dead . The first witness was there , in the kitchen . So were my master , Katherine , and the groom . I alluded to the conversation which had taken place between the deceased and the prisoner in the morning . The surgeon mentioned about Katherine having bought the laudanum at his house . Katherine seemed very much confused . She was then given into custody . "
580531	580757	580527	580528	James Martin	1447	" I am groom and coachman to the Rev. Mr. Tracy . On the evening in question I heard screams in the yard . I was in the stable adjoining . There is a communication between the yard of the house and the stable yard . I hastened to the yard of the house where the screams came from . I saw Katherine wringing her hands and crying . I asked her what was the matter ? She said , ' Mrs. Kenrick is dead . ' I hurried into the kitchen . Almost immediately afterwards Mr. Tracy came in . He had been alarmed by the screams too , he said . I found the housekeeper lying forward on the table , with her face resting on her arms , as if she had fallen asleep . I raised her , and laid her back in her chair . She seemed quite dead . Mr. Tracy was greatly affected . Katherine did not offer to help , but withdrew to the farther end of the kitchen . She cried very much . Mr. Tracy sent me for a surgeon . When I came back with the first witness , we found Mr. Tracy bathing deceased 's head with vinegar , and doing all he could to recover her . Katherine was not assisting him . "
580783	580823	580777	580777	He	4395	" When I first went into the kitchen , there were no cups , nor glasses , nor any drinking vessels on the table . All the tea - things had been washed and put into their proper place . "
580830	581007	580824	580827	The Rev. Reginald Tracy	1350	" I received the prisoner into my service through charity . I had no character with her . I had known her before , because she had attended the St. David 's Sunday Schools . I considered her to be a most exemplary young person . I was not aware that Mrs. Kenrick intended to send her away . Mrs. Kenrick had the power , if she chose to do so , as she managed my household for me . I can not say that Katherine had done any thing to offend Mrs. Kenrick . She had done nothing to offend me . In the evening I was alarmed by screams . I went down into the kitchen , and found the housekeeper in the position described by the last witness . I sent him for a surgeon , and adopted all the remedies within my reach to recover the housekeeper . I think I had observed that something had been preying upon the mind of the deceased . She had lately been melancholy and abstracted . "
581012	581108	581109	581110	A policeman	28229	" I am not aware that Katherine went out on the evening in question . I do not know that she visited her uncle on that evening . I can not say that she did not . She would not have asked me for permission to do so . She would have applied to Mrs. Kenrick . I was unwell all day , and did not leave my room until I heard the screams . I was very loath to believe that Katherine could have perpetrated such a deed . I told the surgeon so . "
581113	581176	581109	581110	A policeman	28229	" I was summoned to Mr. Tracy 's house on the evening in question . I took the prisoner into custody . When I had conveyed her to the station - house , I returned to Mr. Tracy 's house . I searched the kitchen . I found the phial , produced in court , upon a shelf . It was empty . "
581260	581270	581272	581272	one	2053	" What an amiable man he appears to be ! "
581274	581288	581290	581290	another	26953	" How he endeavoured to create an impression in favour of the prisoner , "
581292	581304	581306	581307	a third	2623	" He said that he was loath to believe her guilty , "
581309	581320	581306	581307	a third	2623	" and considered her to be an exemplary young person . "
581321	581326	581328	581330	the first speaker	27976	" Hush ! hush ! "
581332	581341	581328	581330	the first speaker	27976	" the case is about to be resumed . "
581846	581850	581854	581855	the barrister	4397	" My lords , "
581869	581881	581854	581855	the barrister	4397	" this case is likely to take a most unexpected turn . "
581882	581887	581889	581889	Richard	874	" Heaven be thanked ! "
581893	581910	581891	581891	himself	874	" the poor creature 's innocence will be made apparent — I feel that it will ! "
581956	581960	581962	581963	the barrister	4397	" My lords , "
581965	581988	581962	581963	the barrister	4397	" I need not continue my speech in defence of the prisoner . I shall at once proceed to call my witnesses . "
582000	582004	582006	582007	the barrister	4397	" Jacob Smithers ! "
582025	582279	582020	582020	He	39028	" The prisoner is my niece . She called at my house on the evening alluded to . She remained with me at least half an hour . She did not complain of Mrs. Kenrick ; nor did she say that she was to leave the Rev. Mr. Tracy 's house . I remember that I was very low - spirited myself that evening ; and so I suppose she did not choose to annoy me by saying that she was to leave . Or else , perhaps , she thought that I should wish her to return home to me if I knew that she was to leave Mr. Tracy 's service . I have been to Belfast where I was detained some days : then I accepted an engagement to go to the Isle of Man . I never received any letter informing me of what had occurred to my niece . The fact is , I do not go by my right name when I travel in that way , because I have to stop at inns , and do not like to be known . That is probably the reason why a letter addressed to me by the name of Smithers did not reach me . I did not see the account of this business in the newspapers until a few days since , when I was in the Isle of Man ; and I returned home as quick as possible . I only reached London an hour ago . "
582280	582286	582288	582289	the barrister	4397	" You may stand down , "
582300	582304	582297	582297	he	4397	" Rachel Bennet ! "
582335	582372	582332	582332	She	15904	" I am the sister of the deceased , and reside about three miles from Hounslow . I received a letter from my sister early in February . The letter now shown me is the one . "
582388	582475	582332	582332	She	15904	" On the following day I received a letter from Mr. Tracy informing me of my sister 's death , and stating that it was supposed she had been poisoned by a young person then in custody . I was bed - ridden with illness at the time , and was supposed to be dying . I could not therefore come to London , or take any steps in the matter . Some one came to me yesterday , and induced me to come to town . "
582519	582806	582807	582807	Your	15909	" I hope this will find you much improved in health : at the same time I am somewhat anxious at not having heard from you . My present object in writing to you is to request you to receive at your house a young person in whom I am interested , and who is at present in Mr. Tracy 's service . Katherine Wilmot is a pretty and interesting girl ; and it would be unsafe for her to remain here . You know , dear Rachel , that you and I have never had any secrets between us ; and I am not now going to break through that rule of mutual confidence which has been the basis of our sincere attachment . The truth is , Mr. Tracy is not what he was . He has fallen from the pinnacle of virtue which he once so proudly occupied ; and it was only this morning that I had the most convincing proof of his weakness and folly ! O Rachel — I met him and his mistress face to face upon the stairs ! But I will not dwell upon this : I sincerely pray to heaven that he may repent , and become the good man he once was . I know that this secret will be sacred with you . But I am determined to remove from him all temptations , as far as lies in my humble power ; and you may now comprehend my motives for sending Katherine Wilmot away from this house . In a word , I shall despatch her to you by to - morrow 's coach ; and will write at greater length by her . "
582814	582858	582811	582812	MATILDA KENRICK	1440	" This letter produced a most extraordinary sensation in the court . The Judges , the barrister , the prisoner , and the audience were astounded at this revelation of the weakness of that man whom the world almost worshipped as a saint . "
582863	582870	582871	582871	he	15911	" murmured Richard Markham to himself : "
582884	582941	582942	582942	You	0	" And what of Reginald himself ? The moment the clerk reached that paragraph which proclaimed the astounding fact of his unworthiness , a cold perspiration broke out upon his forehead ; and he turned to leave the court . But Morris Benstead caught him by the arm , and pointing to a seat , said , "
582958	583016	582955	582956	an officer	27507	" The rector cast a look of unutterable dismay upon the policeman , and fell upon the bench in a state of mind bordering on distraction . Meantime the case proceeded . The counsel for the prosecution said that he should like to ask Rachel Bennet a few questions . That witness accordingly returned to the box . "
583037	583043	583019	583019	you	26649	" inquired the prosecuting counsel . "
583146	583147	583148	583148	We	15927	" "
583158	583164	583148	583148	We	15927	" exclaimed the prosecuting counsel . "
583170	583171	583148	583148	We	15927	" "
583174	583182	583148	583148	We	15927	" cried the barrister for the defence : "
583198	583199	583200	583200	I	0	" "
583206	583211	583200	583200	I	0	" continued the woman , "
583311	583312	583294	583294	I	0	" "
583319	583337	583314	583314	you	15933	" said the counsel for the prisoner : then , in a loud tone , he called , "
583341	583485	583338	583339	John Smithers	1451	" And Gibbet entered the witness - box . His first glance was towards the dock ; and that look , rapid , and imperceptible to others , conveyed a world of hope to the bosom of poor Katherine . Richard Markham was at a loss to conceive what testimony the hump - back could bring forward in the prisoner 's favour . Every one present felt the deepest interest in the turn given to the proceedings . The hump - back stood upon a stool that there was in the witness - box ; and even then his head was alone visible . His hideous countenance , pale and ghastly through his intense feelings for Katherine 's situation , was nevertheless animated with confidence and hope . Amidst a dead silence of awe - inspiring solemnity , he deposed as follows : — "
583632	583689	583630	583630	Katherine	1413	" A murmur , expressive of deep feeling — mingled surprise , sympathy , and admiration — on the part of the audience , followed this ingenuous announcement . Many an eye was moistened with a tear ; and even the Judges did not look angrily when that murmur met their ears . Gibbet continued : — "
584205	584267	584268	584268	My	0	" The reader may imagine the profound sensation which this narrative created . Richard Markham was literally astounded . Katherine Wilmot wept abundantly . Reginald Tracy was crushed , as it were , to the very dust , by this overwhelming exposure of his guilt . The jury whispered together for a few moments ; and the foreman rose and said , "
584296	584297	584288	584288	we	15948	" "
584303	584309	584288	584288	we	15948	" said the senior judge . "
584325	584326	584327	584327	I	0	" "
584336	584415	584327	584327	I	0	" exclaimed Morris Benstead in a loud tone . In a private room up stairs , at a tavern nearly opposite the Court - house of the Old Bailey , a happy party was assembled . And yet the group was somewhat motley . It consisted of Richard Markham , Katherine Wilmot , the Public Executioner , Gibbet , Rachel Bennet , and Morris Benstead . The best luncheon which the house afforded was spread upon the table . "
584427	584431	584418	584418	you	0	" said Benstead . "
584461	584462	584435	584436	the man	2092	" "
584487	584492	584464	584464	you	0	" said Richard Markham . "
584507	584512	584513	584513	I	0	" returned the policeman . "
584656	584665	584644	584645	the housekeeper	39575	" added Benstead , turning towards Mrs. Bennet . "
584866	584867	584874	584874	she	1430	" "
584885	584889	584893	584893	sir	26649	" observed Richard . "
584895	584899	584893	584893	sir	26649	" said Benstead . "
585417	585418	585402	585403	Mr. Smithers	1405	" "
585424	585428	585421	585422	Mr. Markham	874	" said Katherine , "
585464	585465	585466	585466	I	0	" "
585476	585481	585466	585466	I	0	" returned our hero ; "
585498	585499	585495	585495	my	0	" "
585519	585523	585515	585515	I	0	" said Kate . "
585531	585544	585525	585525	you	874	" she continued , turning towards Gibbet , who was seated next to her,—"you
585559	585560	585525	585525	you	874	" "
585569	585582	585567	585567	Kate	1413	" said the hump - back , whimpering like a mere child . "
585602	585603	585585	585585	you	874	" "
585631	585643	585613	585613	you	874	" exclaimed Kate , tears also streaming down her own cheeks . "
585683	585684	585704	585704	you	1413	" "
585690	585695	585704	585704	you	1413	" said the executioner , "
585725	585726	585704	585704	you	1413	" "
585733	585739	585740	585740	you	874	" answered the young maiden , "
585820	585821	585803	585803	they	16003	" "
585836	585849	585825	585825	I	0	" exclaimed the executioner , as if struck by a sudden remorse . "
585897	585923	585892	585892	I	0	" she added slowly ; for the amiable girl was anxious to extenuate her uncle 's self - accusation in the eyes of those present . "
585934	585943	585892	585892	I	0	" cried the executioner , with resolute emphasis ; "
585963	586030	586031	586031	Uncle	29368	" Smithers threw himself back in his chair , and compressed his lips together to restrain his emotions . But nature asserted her empire . A tear trickled from each eye , and rolled slowly down the cheeks of that man whose heart had been so brutalized by his fearful calling . Kate rose from her chair , and threw herself into his arms , exclaiming , "
586048	586087	586037	586037	you	29368	" Gibbet cried , and yet laughed — sobbed , and yet smiled , in so strange a manner , as he contemplated that touching scene , that the result of his emotions presented the most ludicrous aspect . "
586094	586098	586091	586091	Kate	1413	" said Smithers : "
586192	586193	586195	586195	me	0	" "
586197	586214	586215	586215	me	0	" exclaimed Richard Markham , who was ever sensibly alive to the existence of generous feelings in others,—"believe
586217	586226	586195	586195	me	0	" he cried , grasping Smithers ' hand , "
586239	586240	586229	586231	a good man	9198	" "
586245	586252	586254	586254	you	26649	" ejaculated Smithers , unfeignedly surprised ; "
586262	586263	586258	586260	the Public Executioner	39028	" "
586277	586281	586269	586269	I	0	" replied Markham , "
586308	586353	586354	586354	You	0	" The Public Executioner fixed upon the animated and handsome countenance of our hero a glance of the deepest gratitude — a glance of respect , almost of veneration ! He then cast down his eyes , and appeared to plunge into profound rumination . "
586364	586368	586354	586354	You	0	" said Benstead , "
586391	586392	586383	586384	Mrs. Kenrick	1430	" "
586398	586425	586426	586427	my uncle	29276	" exclaimed the young maiden , upon whose heart the noble conduct of Richard Markham towards her despised and degraded relative had made a deep impression : "
586466	586467	586458	586458	I	0	" "
586475	586480	586458	586458	I	0	" exclaimed Mrs. Bennet , "
586526	586557	586511	586511	I	0	" Katherine turned a look of deep gratitude upon the good woman who made her this generous offer ; and then she glanced timidly towards her uncle and Richard Markham . "
586571	586576	586577	586577	I	0	" said our hero , "
586617	586618	586619	586619	I	0	" "
586630	586635	586640	586640	you	26649	" observed the executioner : "
586668	586669	586670	586670	I	0	" "
586681	586710	586675	586675	I	0	" said Richard , touched by the strange gentleness of manner which was now evinced by one lately so rude , so brutal , so self - willed . "
586725	586726	586720	586721	Mrs. Bennet	1452	" "
586746	586810	586731	586732	Mrs. Bennet	1452	" said the executioner . Mrs. Bennet now suggested that her husband would be uneasy if she remained long absent from home ; and Richard immediately summoned the waiter , to whom he gave orders to procure a post - chaise . This command was speedily executed . Katherine took leave of her relatives , Markham , and Benstead , with streaming eyes . "
586818	586880	586815	586816	my girl	10714	" said the executioner , in a tone the tremulousness of which he could not altogether subdue . Gibbet could say nothing : his voice was choked with sobs . Katherine , however , whispered words of kindness in his ears ; and the poor hump - back smiled as he wrung her hand with all the fervour of his affection . "
586887	586891	586815	586816	my girl	10714	" said Kate , "
586910	586911	586915	586915	Katherine	1413	" "
586917	586928	586915	586915	Katherine	1413	" returned Richard , shaking her warmly by the hand ; "
586948	587030	586936	586938	a sincere friend	16033	" The young maiden then tendered her thanks to the good - hearted policeman for the interest he had manifested in her favour . The farewells were all said ; good wishes were given and returned ; and Mrs. Bennet hurried Katherine from the room . Those who remained behind , watched their departure from the window . The moment the post - chaise had rolled away from the door of the tavern , Smithers accosted our hero , and said , "
587250	587386	587243	587243	I	0	" And the executioner turned abruptly aside ; for he was weeping — he was weeping ! Markham had not interrupted him while he spoke , because our hero knew that it was well for that man to give way to the good feelings which the contemplation of humanity and philanthropy in others had so recently awakened . But Richard did not perceive that , while the executioner was giving utterance to the invincible promptings of nature , Gibbet had drawn near,—had listened to his father with indescribable interest,—had drunk in with surprise and avidity every word that fell from his lips,—and had gradually sunk upon his knees in the presence of that benefactor whom even a rude , brutalized , and savage disposition was now compelled to believe to be something more than man ! "
587391	587411	587413	587413	sir	26649	" said Benstead , glancing his eyes around , and touching Markham 's arm to direct his attention to the scene,—"this
587425	587443	587413	587413	sir	26649	" Richard hastily brushed away a tear , and raising Gibbet from his adoring posture , said , "
587465	587493	587494	587494	You	26649	" Then our hero caught Smithers by the hand , and drawing him into the recess of a window , whispered in a low and rapid tone , "
587535	587551	587521	587521	I	0	" Smithers did not answer for a few moments : he appeared to reflect profoundly . "
587562	587568	587554	587554	I	0	" he at length said : "
587593	587923	587924	587925	fashionable preachers	16052	" With these words the executioner turned abruptly away , caught Gibbet by the hand , and hurried from the room . A few minutes afterwards Richard Markham and Benstead also took their departure , each in a different direction ; but the police - officer 's pocket contained substantial proofs of our hero 's liberality . A week passed away , during which the examination of Reginald Tracy took place before the police - magistrate , and terminated in the committal of the rector to Newgate . The whole town rang with the extraordinary events which had led to this crisis in the career of a man whose very name had so lately inspired respect . The clergy were horror - struck at the disgrace brought upon their cloth by this terrific explosion ; for people grew inclined to look upon real ecclesiastical sanctity as nothing more nor less than a garb of rank hypocrisy . Some ministers of the gospel , more daring and enthusiastic than the rest , boldly proclaimed from their pulpits that Reginald Tracy was a saint and a martyr , against whom a horrible conspiracy had been concocted in order to remove the imputation of murder from the young female who had been discharged , and fix it on him . Other clergymen entered into learned disquisitions to prove that Satan must have obtained especial leave from God , as in the case of Job , to tempt the most holy and pious of men ; and that , having failed to seduce him from the right path , the Evil One had accomplished a series of atrocities all so artfully arranged as to fix the stain upon the rector of St. David 's . But there were some reverend gentlemen , who , having always been jealous of Reginald Tracy 's popularity , descanted in significant terms upon the shallowness of mere eloquence in the pulpit , and the folly of running after "
587927	587962	587924	587925	fashionable preachers	16052	" One venerable and holy gentleman , who had been married three times , and had received from his wives an aggregate of seventeen pledges of their affection , bitterly denounced in his sermon the "
587966	587967	587924	587925	fashionable preachers	16052	" "
587971	587973	587924	587925	fashionable preachers	16052	" and "
587977	588080	587924	587925	fashionable preachers	16052	" who had dared to set his face against the sacred institution of matrimony . The fashionable world was powerfully excited by the exposure of Reginald Tracy . Some wiseacres shook their heads , and observed that they had always suspected there was something wrong about the rector ; others plainly asserted that they had even prophesied what would happen some day . The fair sex all agreed that it was a great pity , as he was such a charming preacher and such a handsome man ! The press was not idle in respect to the business . The newspapers teemed with "
588084	588331	588332	588334	The Murdered Housekeeper	16053	" and all the penny - a - liners in London were on the alert to collate additional facts . Nine out of ten of these facts , however , turned out to be pure fictions . One journal , conducted on more imaginative principles than its contemporaries , promulgated a new discovery which it had made in respect to the rector 's history , and coolly fixed upon his back all the murders which had occurred in the metropolis during the previous dozen years , and the perpetrators of which had never yet been detected . Heaven knows Reginald Tracy was bad enough ; but if one believed all which was now said of him in the public journals , no monster that ever disgraced humanity was so vile as he . Some of the cheap unstamped periodicals treated their readers with portraits of the rector ; and as very few of the artists who were employed to draw them had ever seen their subject , and were now unable to obtain access to him , their inventive faculties were put to the most exciting test . And , as a convincing proof that no two persons entertain the same idea of an object which they have never seen , it may be observed that there was a most extraordinary variety in the respective characteristics of these portraits . In a word , the rector 's name engrossed universal attention:—a cheap romance was issued , entitled "
588339	588781	588784	588784	ma'am	26745	Clergyman;"—one of the minor theatres attracted crowded houses by the embodiment of the particulars of the case in a melodrama;—and Madame Tussaud added the effigy of Reginald Tracy to her collection of wax - works . But what were the feelings of Lady Cecilia Harborough when the terrible announcement of the rector 's arrest met her ears ! We must observe that when she first heard of the death of the housekeeper , she entertained a faint suspicion that Reginald , and not Katherine Wilmot , was the author of the deed . But while the young girl was yet in prison , before the trial , and when Cecilia and the rector met , the latter so eloquently expatiated upon the case , that Cecilia 's suspicions were hushed ; and she learnt to look upon the housekeeper 's death following so shortly on the exposure of the rector 's hypocrisy to that female , as a remarkable coincidence only . Moreover , the rector had all along declared his impression that the housekeeper had committed suicide , and that the innocence of Katherine would be made apparent before the judges . Thus Cecilia 's mind had been more or less tranquillised during the interval which occurred between the housekeeper 's death and the day of trial . But when , in the afternoon of the day on which that trial took place , the appalling news of Katherine 's acquittal and Reginald 's arrest reached her ears , she was thrown into a state of the most painful excitement . It was true that she could not in the slightest degree be implicated in the enormous crime of which he was accused : but would her guilty connexion with him transpire ? Her conscience entertained the worst forebodings in this respect . At one moment she thought of hastening to visit him in his prison : then she reflected that such a course would only encourage a suspicion calculated to proclaim that scandal which she was so anxious to avoid . Fortunately Sir Rupert Harborough was still away from home , with his friend Chichester , and thus Lady Cecilia had no disagreeable spy to witness her distressing emotions and embarrassment . Day after day passed ; Reginald had been committed , as before stated , to Newgate ; and Cecilia heard nothing from him . At length at the expiration of a week from the day of his arrest , a dirty , shabby - looking lad called in Tavistock Square , and requested to see Lady Cecilia Harborough alone . He was accordingly admitted to her presence . "
588786	588790	588784	588784	ma'am	26745	" he said , "
588824	588825	588821	588821	they	16056	" "
588830	588840	588828	588828	you	0	" demanded Cecilia , with ill - concealed disgust . "
588857	588862	588864	588864	I	0	" returned the boy ; "
588874	588875	588864	588864	I	0	" "
588884	588885	588879	588879	you	0	" "
588908	588909	588890	588891	Mr. Tracy	1353	" "
588913	588923	588890	588891	Mr. Tracy	1353	" ejaculated Lady Cecilia , with an unaffected shudder . "
588960	588961	588945	588945	I	0	" "
588980	588981	588971	588971	you	0	" "
589115	589116	589113	589113	ma'am	26745	" "
589121	589152	589113	589113	ma'am	26745	" said Lady Cecilia , in a tone of deep disgust , as she threw the lad a few shillings across the table in the room where she received him . "
589167	589172	589174	589174	I	0	" asked the boy ; "
589185	589186	589174	589174	I	0	" "
589198	589202	589187	589187	You	0	" answered Cecilia : "
589228	589229	589232	589232	ma'am	26745	" "
589238	589243	589232	589232	ma'am	26745	" replied the boy ; "
589248	589260	589232	589232	ma'am	26745	" He then pocketed the money , and took his departure . "
589265	589277	589232	589232	ma'am	26745	" thought Lady Cecilia , when she was once more alone : "
589441	589639	589433	589433	he	27445	" This idea determined Lady Cecilia upon visiting Newgate on the following day . She did not reflect that she herself was the first link in that chain which had so rapidly wound itself around the unhappy man , until it paralysed his limbs in a criminal gaol . She often asked herself how he could have been so mad as to commit the deed that menaced him with the most terrible fate ; but beyond the abstract event itself she never thought of looking . The morning dawned ; Lady Cecilia rose , and dressed herself in as unpretending a manner as possible . At half - past nine she went out , took a cab at the nearest stand , and proceeded to Newgate . She ascertained , by inquiry , which was the prison entrance , and ascended the steps leading to the half - door , the top of which was garnished with long iron spikes . A stout , red - faced turnkey , with a good - tempered countenance , admitted her into the obscure lobby , behind which was a passage where a gas - light burns all day long . "
589647	589652	589642	589642	you	16085	" said the turnkey . "
589656	589661	589642	589642	you	16085	" was the reply . "
589669	589670	589663	589663	you	16085	" "
589682	589683	589642	589642	you	16085	" "
589694	589715	589716	589717	Anne Tracy	1457	" Lady Cecilia , who seldom lost her presence of mind , instantly took up the pen , and wrote down "
589719	589720	589716	589717	Anne Tracy	1457	" "
589726	589731	589722	589722	me	0	" said the turnkey , "
589747	589748	589741	589741	you	16085	" "
589753	589757	589749	589749	I	0	" answered Cecilia . "
589779	589861	589768	589777	a turnkey who will admit you to Tracy 's cell	16091	" All titular distinctions are dropped in Newgate . Lady Cecilia proceeded along the passage as she was desired , and at length reached a large stone vestibule , from which several doors opened into the different yards in that part of the building . She accosted a turnkey , informing him whom she came to visit ; and he bade her follow him . In a few moments he stopped at a massive door , opened it , and said , "
589868	589920	589768	589777	a turnkey who will admit you to Tracy 's cell	16091	" She advanced a few steps : the door closed behind her ; and she found herself in the presence of Reginald Tracy . But how changed was he ! His cheeks were ghastly pale — his eyes sunken — his hair was in disorder — his person dirty and neglected . "
589929	589939	589927	589927	Cecilia	1008	" he said , without rising from his chair . "
589959	589960	589963	589963	Reginald	1350	" "
589965	589975	589963	589963	Reginald	1350	" exclaimed Cecilia , as she took a seat , "
589985	589986	589963	589963	Reginald	1350	" "
590002	590006	589963	589963	Reginald	1350	" said Reginald . "
590030	590031	590020	590020	You	26745	" "
590041	590045	590036	590036	you	1350	" observed Cecilia . "
590052	590056	590046	590046	I	0	" continued Reginald : "
590072	590077	590078	590078	I	0	" he added bitterly , "
590095	590096	590088	590088	you	26745	" "
590108	590109	590099	590099	Reginald	1350	" "
590116	590122	590114	590114	Cecilia	1008	" interrupted the rector impatiently . "
590145	590146	590130	590130	you	1008	" "
590165	590170	590130	590130	you	1008	" said Lady Cecilia . "
590190	590191	590186	590188	no light one	16098	" "
590213	590217	590186	590188	no light one	16098	" returned Cecilia . "
590220	590226	590242	590242	him	28766	" exclaimed the rector contemptuously . "
590307	590312	590300	590301	my heiress	16096	" he added slowly , "
590357	590358	590343	590343	I	0	" "
590365	590394	590363	590363	you	0	" said Cecilia , somewhat alarmed . The rector leant forward , fixed a penetrating glance upon his mistress , and said in a hollow and subdued tone , "
590403	590404	590395	590395	I	0	" "
590407	590415	590419	590419	you	16105	" echoed Cecilia , with a shudder . "
590434	590439	590425	590425	you	16105	" he asked eagerly . "
590446	590452	590443	590443	you	0	" demanded Cecilia greatly excited . "
590466	590471	590443	590443	you	0	" answered the rector . "
590494	590495	590481	590486	the old hag in Golden Lane	16108	" "
590504	590508	590481	590486	the old hag in Golden Lane	16108	" said Cecilia . "
590514	590515	590516	590516	My	0	" "
590528	590551	590522	590522	I	0	" answered Reginald , who only maintained the composure which he now displayed by the most desperate efforts to subdue his emotions . "
590571	590580	590581	590581	I	0	" he continued , in a musing tone . "
590792	590810	590833	590833	you	1008	" He paused , and buried his face in his hands . A sob escaped his breast . "
590822	590827	590833	590833	you	1008	" he suddenly cried . "
590857	590858	590839	590839	you	1008	" "
590868	590879	590863	590863	you	1008	" said Cecilia , in a low but decided tone . "
590888	590892	590863	590863	you	1008	" continued Reginald ; "
590929	590930	590931	590931	I	0	" "
590945	590950	590940	590940	you	0	" said his mistress . "
590971	590972	590955	590955	We	16117	" "
590975	590980	590955	590955	We	16117	" was the answer . "
590997	591001	591002	591002	You	1008	" said Reginald . "
591008	591009	591002	591002	You	1008	" "
591019	591157	591158	591158	Fool	27204	" The rector offered the lady his hand : Cecilia pressed it with affected fervour , though in reality she almost recoiled from the touch . Profligate as she was , she had no sincere sympathy for a murderer . Nor was she sorry when she once more found herself beyond the terrible walls of Newgate . Reginald Tracy awoke early on the morning when Cecilia was to return to him . He had been dreaming of delicious scenes and voluptuous pleasures ; and he opened his eyes to the fearful realities of Newgate . He clasped his hands together with the convulsiveness of ineffable mental agony ; and the smile that had played upon his lips in his elysian dream , was suddenly changed into the contortion of an anguish that could know no earthly mitigation . "
591166	591178	591158	591158	Fool	27204	" he exclaimed aloud , in a piercing tone of despair . "
591299	591316	591341	591342	a murderer	27686	" Then the rector sate up in his bed , and glanced wildly around the cell . "
591321	591330	591341	591342	a murderer	27686	" he cried with a shriek of despair ; "
591349	591401	591341	591342	a murderer	27686	" He threw himself back on the rude bolster , and covered his face with his hands . But though he closed his eyes , and pressed his fingers upon the lids until the balls throbbed beneath , he could not shut out from his mind the horrors of his position . "
591408	591492	591341	591342	a murderer	27686	" he cried , and then rolled upon his bed in convulsions of rage : he gnashed his teeth — he beat his brow — he tore his hair — he clenched his fists with the fury of a demon . His emotions were terrible . He seemed like a wild beast caught in a net whose meshes were inextricable . Then a rapid reaction took place in that man of powerful passion ; and he grew exhausted — humble — and penitent . "
591501	591511	591512	591512	I	0	" he said , joining his hands in prayer . "
591550	591595	591596	591597	That wretch	16123	" This short prayer , in which reproach and intercession were commingled , was said with profound sincerity . But the image of Cecilia suddenly sprang up in the rector 's imagination ; and then his entire form once more became convulsed with rage . "
591605	591626	591596	591597	That wretch	16123	" he exclaimed , clenching his fist so violently that the nails of his fingers almost penetrated into his palms . "
591789	591813	591814	591815	Senseless idiot	16128	" And again he beat his forehead and his breast : again he tore his hair , and writhed convulsively on his bed . "
591821	591825	591814	591815	Senseless idiot	16128	" he continued . "
592014	592035	592005	592006	the Almighty	4958	" The rector ceased , and lay for some instants still and motionless . But his mind was fearfully active . "
592042	592048	592005	592006	the Almighty	4958	" he thought within himself , "
592194	592246	592170	592171	a wretch	16141	" These thoughts were too heart - rending for the miserable man to endure ; and , starting from his bed , he threw on his clothes with a rapidity that denoted the feverish state of his mind . The clock struck eight ; and his breakfast was brought to him . "
592257	592262	592170	592171	a wretch	16141	" he asked himself . "
592344	592365	592338	592338	God	880	" Thus passed the time of this truly wretched man . At length the clock struck nine — next ten . "
592370	592383	592367	592367	she	16146	" he said , as he paced his cell with agitated steps . "
592532	592566	592524	592524	I	0	" Nor was Reginald mistaken . Scarcely had he arrived at that point in his musings , when the bolts of his cell were drawn back , and Lady Cecilia entered the dungeon . "
592574	592579	592571	592571	your	0	" said the rector . "
592588	592598	592582	592582	I	0	" answered Cecilia , throwing herself into a chair : "
592611	592612	592614	592614	you	0	" "
592619	592658	592614	592614	you	0	" asked Reginald in a hollow tone . Cecilia drew from her bosom a small crystal phial , and handed it to the rector . He greedily withdrew the cork , and placed the bottle to his nostrils . "
592671	592685	592686	592686	I	0	" he exclaimed , as he carefully concealed the phial about his person , "
592695	592717	592718	592718	My	0	" And , as he spoke , his countenance was animated with an expression of diabolical triumph . Cecilia was alarmed . "
592726	592730	592718	592718	My	0	" she cried ; "
592738	592739	592735	592735	myself	0	" "
592746	592751	592735	592735	myself	0	" said the rector ; "
592773	592774	592764	592764	I	0	" "
592791	592808	592789	592789	Reginald	1350	" returned Cecilia , affecting a tenderness of tone and manner which she did not feel . "
592820	592850	592817	592818	beloved Cecilia	1008	" exclaimed the rector ; and as she cast down her eyes beneath his looks , he glared upon her for a moment with the ferocity of a tiger . "
592862	592867	592869	592869	you	0	" he added composedly , "
592888	592889	592885	592885	his	28766	" "
592894	592902	592885	592885	his	28766	" echoed Cecilia , turning deadly pale . "
592912	592913	592903	592903	You	1350	" "
592921	592925	592885	592885	his	28766	" said Reginald . "
592940	592941	592933	592933	you	0	" "
592951	592955	592933	592933	you	0	" cried Cecilia . "
592969	592970	592971	592972	Foolish woman	16152	" "
592983	592987	592933	592933	you	0	" ejaculated Reginald . "
593044	593045	593082	593082	Cecilia	1008	" "
593057	593076	593055	593055	Reginald	1350	" said Cecilia , in whose breast the mention of the twenty thousand pounds had stifled all compunction . "
593088	593093	593082	593082	Cecilia	1008	" observed the rector . "
593109	593110	593103	593103	I	0	" "
593118	593153	593114	593114	Reginald	1350	" exclaimed Cecilia , who was not sorry to escape a ceremony which she had anticipated with horror — for the idea that her paramour was a murderer was ever present in her mind . "
593158	593179	593156	593156	Cecilia	1008	" added the rector ; and he turned his back to the door . In another moment she was gone . "
593191	593202	593183	593183	I	0	" cried Reginald , when he was once more alone . "
593358	593498	593348	593348	hers	1008	" Then the rector paced his cell , while from his breast escaped a hoarse sound like the low growling of a wild beast . But we will not dwell upon the wretched man 's thoughts and words throughout that long day . Evening came . Six o'clock struck ; and Reginald feared no farther interruption from the turnkeys . He then sate down to write two letters . Having occupied himself in this manner for a short time , he sealed the letters , and addressed them . When this task was accomplished , he felt more composed and calm than he had done during the day . He walked three or four times up and down his cell . Then he fell upon his knees , and prayed fervently . Yes — fervently ! Seven o'clock struck . "
593504	593564	593348	593348	hers	1008	" he exclaimed , rising from his suppliant posture near the bed . He took the bottle from his pocket : a convulsive shudder passed over him as he handled the fatal phial whose contents were to sever the chain which bound his spirit to the earth . Then he felt weak and nervous ; and he sate down . "
593570	593576	593577	593577	I	0	" he said to himself : "
593584	593593	593330	593330	she	1008	" But he still hesitated for a minute ! "
593598	593617	593330	593330	she	1008	" he exclaimed , as if in answer to an idea which had occupied him during that interval ; "
593631	593866	593623	593623	My	0	" This thought nerved him with courage to execute his desperate purpose . He raised the phial to his lips , and swallowed the contents — greedy of every drop . In a few seconds he fell from his chair — a heavy , lifeless mass — upon the floor of the dungeon . Cecilia passed a sleepless and agitated night . Wild hopes and undefined fears had banished repose from her pillow . She thought the morning would never come . At length the first gleam of dawn struggled through the windows of her bed - room ; and she instantly arose . She was pale — yet fearfully excited ; and there was a wildness in her eyes which denoted the most cruel suspense . The minutes seemed to be hours ; for she was now anxiously awaiting the arrival of the morning paper . She descended to the breakfast parlour ; but the repast remained untouched . At length the well - known knock of the news - boy at the front door echoed through the house . The moment the journal was placed on the table by her side , Cecilia took it up with trembling hands , and cast a hasty glance over its contents . In another instant all suspense relative to the rector 's fate ceased . The following words settled that point beyond a doubt : — "
593875	593991	593872	593873	REGINALD TRACY	1350	" Shortly after eight o'clock last evening a rumour was in circulation , to the effect that the above - mentioned individual , whose name has so recently been brought before the public in connection with the murder of Matilda Kenrick , had put a period to his existence by means of poison . It appears that the turnkey , on visiting his cell , according to custom , at eight o'clock , found him stretched upon the floor , to all appearances quite dead . Medical aid was immediately procured ; but life was pronounced by the gaol - surgeon to be totally extinct . We have been unable to learn any further particulars . "
593992	594005	594009	594009	herself	1008	" It is better so , than to die upon the scaffold , "
594011	594032	594009	594009	herself	1008	" Now to the lawyer 's : Reginald expressly told me that I was to call upon him this morning . "
594177	594191	594193	594195	the frail woman	16167	" Did you not expect a visit from Lady Cecilia Harborough this morning ? "
594197	594202	594204	594205	the lawyer	2668	" Lady Cecilia Harborough ! "
594222	594229	594207	594207	his	2668	" Are you Lady Cecilia Harborough ? "
594230	594237	594207	594207	his	2668	" I am Lady Cecilia Harborough , "
594242	594254	594256	594257	Mr. Wharton	1458	" So young — and yet so powerful to work evil ! "
594270	594279	594281	594281	Cecilia	1008	" I do not understand you , sir , "
594293	594304	594306	594307	the lawyer	2668	" Do not aggravate your wickedness by means of falsehood , "
594310	594456	594306	594307	the lawyer	2668	" Think you that I am a stranger to your connexion with that unhappy man who died by his own hands last night ? I have known him for many years — I knew him when he was pure , honourable , and respected : I have seen him the inmate of a dungeon . The day before yesterday I was with him for the last time . He then revealed to me every particular connected with his fall . He told me how you practised your syren arts upon him — how you led him on , until he became an adulterer ! He explained to me how he repented of his first weakness , and how you practised a vile — a detestable artifice , by the aid of an old hag in Golden Lane , to bring him back to your arms . "
594457	594475	594477	594478	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Spare me this recital , sir , which has been so highly coloured to my prejudice , "
594480	594495	594477	594478	Lady Cecilia	1008	" I confess that I was enamoured of that unhappy man ; but — — "
594496	594506	594508	594509	Mr. Wharton	1458	" You can not palliate your wickedness , madam , "
594513	594559	594508	594509	Mr. Wharton	1458	" Mr. Tracy detailed to me every blandishment you used — every art you called into force to subdue him . And as for your love for him , Lady Cecilia Harborough — even that excuse can not be advanced in extenuation of your infamy . "
594560	594569	594571	594571	Cecilia	1008	" Sir — that is a harsh word ! "
594583	594591	594593	594594	the solicitor	28220	" Nay , madam — sit still , "
594596	594648	594593	594594	the solicitor	28220	" you may yet hear harsher terms from my lips . I say that you can not even plead a profound and sincere attachment to that man as an excuse for the arts which you practised to ensnare and ruin him:—no , madam — it was his gold which you coveted ! "
594649	594661	594508	594509	Mr. Wharton	1458	" Sir — I will hear no more — I — — "
594662	594670	594672	594673	the lawyer	2668	" Your ladyship must hear me out , "
594683	594775	594777	594778	Mr. Wharton	1458	" When alone in his gloomy cell , your victim pondered upon all that had passed between him and you , until he came to a full and entire comprehension of the utter hollowness of your heart . He then understood how he had been duped and deluded by you ! Moreover , madam , it was by your desire that he admitted you into his own house — that fatal indiscretion which , being often repeated , at length led to the terrible catastrophe . Now , then , madam , "
594784	594817	594781	594781	his	1458	" who was the real cause of my friend 's downfall ? who was the origin of his ruin ? who , in a word , is the murderess of Reginald Tracy ? "
594818	594822	594824	594826	the wretched woman	16172	" My God ! "
594837	594852	594824	594826	the wretched woman	16172	" you are very severe — too , too harsh upon me , sir ! "
594853	594858	594860	594861	the lawyer	2668	" No , madam , "
594863	594956	594860	594861	the lawyer	2668	" I am merely placing your conduct in its true light , and giving your deeds their proper name . You had no mercy upon my unfortunate friend;—you sacrificed him to your base lust after gold;—you hurried him on to his doom . Why should I spare you ? You have no claims upon my forbearance as a woman — because , madam , your unmitigated wickedness debars you from the privilege of your sex . To show courtesy to you , would be to encourage crime of the most abhorrent nature . "
594957	594970	594972	594973	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Was it to be thus upbraided , sir — thus reviled , "
594983	594995	594972	594973	Lady Cecilia	1008	" that I was desired to call upon you this morning ? "
594996	595005	595007	595008	the solicitor	28220	" Desired to call upon me , madam ! "
595010	595018	595007	595008	the solicitor	28220	" who conveyed to you such instructions ? "
595019	595024	595026	595026	Cecilia	1008	" Mr. Tracy himself , "
595042	595074	595076	595077	Mr. Wharton	1458	" Then my poor friend must have been aware of the reception which you would meet at my hands — of the stern truths that you would hear from my lips , "
595079	595092	595076	595077	Mr. Wharton	1458	" for to no other purpose could this visit have been designed . "
595093	595124	595007	595008	the solicitor	28220	" But — are there no written instructions — with which you may be as yet unacquainted — no papers , the contents of which you have not read — — "
595125	595137	595139	595140	the lawyer	2668	" Madam , I am at a loss to comprehend you , "
595142	595178	595139	595140	the lawyer	2668	" If you allude to any papers of Mr. Tracy 's now in my hands , I can assure you that they bear no reference to any affairs in which you can possibly be interested . "
595179	595206	595208	595208	Cecilia	1008	" And you have read all those papers — every one — the last that was placed in your hands , as well as any others ? "
595217	595223	595139	595140	the lawyer	2668	" Merciful heavens , madam ! "
595238	595283	595225	595236	the lawyer , on whose mind a light seemed suddenly to break	16176	" surely — surely you can not be in expectation of a legacy or a boon from that man whom you hurried to his ruin — aye , even to murder and suicide ? Surely your presumption is not so boundless as all that ? "
595332	595339	595341	595342	the lawyer	2668	" No , madam — no , "
595353	595377	595341	595342	the lawyer	2668	" if that unhappy man had bequeathed you any thing , it would have been his curse — his withering , dying curse ! "
595378	595386	595388	595388	Cecilia	1008	" Oh ! do not say that , "
595414	595527	595528	595529	Lady Cecilia	1008	" Ah ! I am rejoiced that your ladyship at last feels the full force of that infamy which has accomplished the ruin of a man once so good , so upright , so honourable , so happy ! But you are , no doubt , curious to know how your victim has disposed of that wealth of which you would have plundered him had he not been so suddenly stopped in his mad career ? I will tell you . He has bequeathed it to that young girl who so nearly suffered for his crime — to Katherine Wilmot , who was so unjustly accused of the enormity which he perpetrated ! "
595539	595546	595552	595554	that stern denunciator	16181	" Weep , madam , weep , "
595561	595594	595552	595554	that stern denunciator	16181	" weep — for you have good cause ! Not for the wealth of the universe would I harbour the feelings which ought to be — must be yours at this moment . "
595621	595637	595639	595640	Mr. Wharton	1458	" I request your ladyship to have the goodness to remain here until my return , "
595642	595650	595639	595640	Mr. Wharton	1458	" I shall not keep you long . "
595714	595791	595704	595704	she	1008	" I have been deceived — cruelly deceived ; and if I did Reginald any wrong , he is amply avenged . One thing seems certain — he has retained the secret of the means by which he obtained the poison . He has not compromised me there ; or else this harsh man would have been only too glad to throw that also in my teeth . Thus , my position might have been worse ! "
595836	595841	595842	595842	he	2668	" Lady Cecilia Harborough , "
595852	595872	595842	595842	he	2668	" the measure of your guilt is now so full , that justice demands an explanation at your hands . "
595873	595878	595880	595882	the frail woman	16167	" Justice , sir ! "
595892	595897	595899	595900	the lawyer	2668	" Yes , madam , "
595902	595919	595899	595900	the lawyer	2668	" and even from the grave will the wrongs of Reginald Tracy cry out against you . "
595920	595929	595930	595930	she	16167	" My God ! what do you mean ? "
595940	595955	595957	595958	the solicitor	28220	" Before Reginald Tracy took the poison which hurried him to his last account , "
595966	596017	595957	595958	the solicitor	28220	" he wrote two letters . These were found upon the table in his cell . One was to Katherine Wilmot — the other was to me . The governor of Newgate has just been with me , and has delivered to me this last communication from my poor friend . "
596018	596024	596026	596026	Cecilia	1008	" The governor of Newgate ! "
596034	596092	595957	595958	the solicitor	28220	" Yes , madam : and the contents are to inform me that you — you , madam , with an assumed name , and passing yourself off as Mr. Tracy 's sister , visited him twice in his cell , and , on the latter occasion , furnished him with the means of self - destruction . "
596093	596104	596106	596106	Cecilia	1008	" Heaven protect me ! it is but too true ! "
596125	596143	596119	596119	she	1008	" You would not give me up to justice , sir — you will not betray me ? "
596144	596149	596151	596152	Mr. Wharton	1458	" No , madam , "
596154	596165	596151	596152	Mr. Wharton	1458	" I had punished you sufficiently when these tidings arrived . "
596166	596175	596177	596177	Cecilia	1008	" Thank you , sir — thank you , "
596184	596192	596177	596177	Cecilia	1008	" But the governor of Newgate — — "
596193	596233	596119	596119	she	1008	" Is gone , madam . I did not tell him that you were here . I must , however , warn you that I communicated to him , as in duty bound , the contents of this letter . "
596234	596243	596318	596319	the lawyer	2668	" Then he is aware that I — — "
596244	596272	596274	596275	the lawyer	2668	" He is aware that you conveyed the poison to Reginald Tracy ; and the officers of justice will be in search of you in another hour , "
596279	596289	596291	596291	Cecilia	1008	" My God ! what will become of me ? "
596304	596316	596318	596319	the lawyer	2668	" I would not say that you were here , madam , "
596321	596459	596318	596319	the lawyer	2668	" because Reginald Tracy had contemplated making me the means of handing you over to the grasp of justice ; and I am sorry that he should so far have misunderstood me . I now comprehend why he directed you to come hither . He thought that his letter would reach me earlier — before you came , and that I should be the willing instrument of his vengeance . I will not show you the letter , because he has mistaken me — he has misunderstood me ; and for this reason alone — and for no merciful feeling towards you — have I shielded you thus far . Now go , madam : when once you are away from this house , you must adopt the best measures you can devise to ensure your safety . "
596460	596479	596481	596481	Cecilia	1008	" But can you not counsel me , sir — will you not direct me how to act ? "
596483	596496	596481	596481	Cecilia	1008	" I am bewildered — I know not what step to take ! "
596497	596507	596509	596510	the lawyer	2668	" I have no counsel to offer , madam , "
596812	596820	596799	596799	She	1008	" Help may come from this quarter ! "
596832	596837	596839	596840	Lady Cecilia	1008	" My good woman , "
596843	596852	596839	596840	Lady Cecilia	1008	" all is known — all is discovered ! "
596853	596858	596860	596862	the old hag	29758	" What is known ? "
596870	596890	596892	596892	Cecilia	1008	" It is known that I conveyed the poison , which you procured for me , to Reginald Tracy , "
596899	596908	596892	596892	Cecilia	1008	" You have heard that he is dead ? "
596909	596916	596918	596919	the hag	29746	" I heard that last evening , "
596921	596929	596918	596919	the hag	29746	" What are you going to do ? "
596930	596940	596892	596892	Cecilia	1008	" To hide myself from the officers of justice , "
596944	596957	596958	596960	The old woman	26813	" But step into this court , or we shall be observed . "
596969	596981	596983	596983	Cecilia	1008	" I must conceal myself — at least for the present , "
596985	596993	596983	596983	Cecilia	1008	" Will you grant me an asylum ? "
596994	597001	597007	597007	her	29746	" I ! my dear lady ! "
597011	597032	597007	597007	her	29746	" I am in danger myself — I am in danger myself ! Did I not procure you the poison ? "
597033	597043	596983	596983	Cecilia	1008	" True . But I would not betray you . "
597044	597066	597068	597069	the hag	29746	" No — we must each shift for ourselves — we must each shift for ourselves , as best we can , "
597072	597109	597068	597069	the hag	29746	" Indeed , I may as well remind you , Lady Cecilia , that your day is gone — you are ruined — and , if you had any spirit , you would not survive it ! "
597110	597119	597121	597121	Cecilia	1008	" My God ! what do you mean ? "
597128	597140	597142	597143	the hag	29746	" The river is deep , or the Monument is high , "
597150	597157	597142	597143	the hag	29746	" and you are near both ! "
597178	597184	597186	597186	Cecilia	1008	" Even she deserts me ! "
597211	597233	597234	597234	Her	16222	" even she deserts me ! My God — is there nothing left to me but suicide ? No — nothing ! "
597269	597277	597278	597278	she	16222	" No — nothing left but that , "
597287	597292	597278	597278	she	16222	" nothing — nothing ! "
597322	597330	597331	597331	she	16222	" The river — or the Monument , "
597341	597391	597331	597331	she	16222	" the river is near — but the Monument is nearer . Drowning must be slow and painful — the other will be instantaneous . From the river I might be rescued ; but no human power can snatch me from death during a fall from that dizzy height . "
597432	597443	597445	597445	one	2053	" And so she was not his sister , then ? "
597447	597452	597454	597455	the other	2054	" No such thing , "
597457	597534	597535	597536	The men	2060	" I heard the governor of Newgate tell all about it to one of the City officers scarcely half an hour ago . The governor was coming out of a lawyer 's house — Tracy 's lawyer , I believe — and the City officer was waiting for him at the door . He then told him that it was a lady of fashion — with a name something like Cecilia Scarborough , I think — — "
597553	597557	597558	597558	she	16172	" Merciful heavens ! "
597571	597581	597558	597558	she	16172	" even at this moment I am not safe ! "
597602	597611	597588	597588	she	16172	" Sixpence , if you please , ma'am , "
597650	597662	597664	597665	the man	2092	" It 's a fine day to view London , ma'am , "
597673	597676	597678	597678	Cecilia	1008	" Beautiful , "
597704	597711	597712	597712	she	1008	" My God ! my God ! "
597717	597725	597712	597712	she	1008	" is it indeed come to this ? "
597753	597761	597762	597762	she	1008	" And yet there is no alternative ! "
597765	597800	597762	597762	she	1008	" none — none ! But my mother — my poor mother ! what will be her feelings ? Oh ! better to know that I am dead , than an inmate of Newgate ! "
597943	597947	597949	597949	Cecilia	1008	" But yesterday , "
597961	598047	597952	597952	she	1008	" had any one said to me , ' Thou wilt seek death to - morrow , ' I should have ridiculed the idea . And yet it has come to this ! Oh ! it is hard to quit this world of pleasure — to leave that city of enjoyment ! Never more to behold that gorgeous sun — never more to hear those busy sounds ! But if I hesitate , my heart will turn coward ; and then — Newgate — Newgate ! "
598273	598285	598292	598292	she	16246	" She can not now betray me for procuring the poison , "
598479	598489	598490	598490	she	1413	" This is kind of you , Mr. Markham , "
598502	598515	598517	598517	Richard	874	" I am come to see you upon important business , Katherine , "
598519	598534	598517	598517	Richard	874	" But first let me inquire after the good people with whom you reside ? "
598535	598542	598544	598544	Katherine	1413	" I am sorry to say , "
598546	598614	598544	598544	Katherine	1413	" that Mrs. Bennet experienced a relapse after her return from London ; and she is not able to leave her chamber . She is , however , much better . Her husband is a kind - hearted , good man , and he behaves like a father to me . He is now occupied with the business of his farm , but will be in presently . "
598615	598631	598633	598633	Markham	874	" And now , Katherine , listen to the tidings which I have to communicate , "
598635	598650	598633	598633	Markham	874	" Have you received any news from London within the last day or two ? "
598651	598658	598544	598544	Katherine	1413	" No — not a word , "
598676	598680	598682	598682	Richard	874	" Compose yourself , "
598684	598714	598682	598682	Richard	874	" the news that I have for you are good . But first I must inform you that your late master , Mr. Reginald Tracy , is no more . "
598715	598718	598720	598720	Katherine	1413	" Dead ! "
598722	598732	598734	598734	Markham	874	" He put a period to his own existence , "
598736	598761	598734	598734	Markham	874	" but not before he made you all the amends in his power for the deep injury which his own guilt entailed upon you . "
598762	598778	598780	598780	Katherine	1413	" Then he confessed his crime , and thus established my innocence beyond all doubt ? "
598782	598812	598780	598780	Katherine	1413	" And he has bequeathed to you his whole fortune , with the exception of a small legacy to Mrs. Bennet , whom his guilt deprived of a sister , "
598817	598825	598827	598827	Katherine	1413	" Oh ! then he died penitent ! "
598866	598874	598876	598876	Richard	874	" He died by his own hands , "
598878	598948	598876	598876	Richard	874	" and the world will not generally admit that such an act can be consonant with sincere penitence . That he attempted to make his peace with heaven ere he rushed into the presence of the Almighty , let us hope:—that he did all he could to recompense those whom his crime had injured , is apparent . But this letter will probably tell you more on that head . "
598966	598971	598957	598957	he	874	" Miss Katherine Wilmot . "
598993	599254	598986	598986	she	30983	" To you , Katherine Wilmot , a man about to appear before his Maker appeals for pardon . That man is deeply imbued with a sense of the injury — the almost irreparable injury which his enormous guilt caused you to sustain . But in confessing that this guilt was all and solely his own,—in proclaiming your complete innocence,—and in offering you the means of henceforth enjoying independence , and fulfilling the dictates of your charitable disposition,—that great criminal entertains a hope that you will accord him your forgiveness , and that you will appreciate his anxiety to do you justice in his last moments . My solicitor is already acquainted with my intentions ; and he will faithfully execute my wishes . This letter will be forwarded to him , to be delivered to you , through your benefactor — that noble - hearted young man , Mr. Richard Markham . The bulk of my fortune , amounting to eighteen thousand pounds , I have made over to my solicitor in trust for yourself , and under certain conditions which I have devised exclusively for your benefit . The sum of five hundred pounds I have , in addition , bequeathed to Rachel Bennet , with the hope that she will extend her pardon also to the man who deprived her of an affectionate sister . This letter is written in a hurried manner , and under circumstances whose appalling nature you may well conceive . May heaven bless you ! Refuse not to pray for the soul of "
599258	599309	598986	598986	she	30983	" Katherine perused this letter , and then handed it to Richard Markham . While he read it , the young maiden prayed inwardly but sincerely for the eternal welfare of him whose course had been dazzling like a meteor , but had terminated in a cloud of appalling blackness . "
599326	599347	599320	599320	I	0	" said Richard , after a long interval of silence , during which he allowed Katherine to compose her thoughts . "
599590	599591	599594	599594	I	0	" "
599621	599625	599626	599626	You	0	" exclaimed Katherine . "
599637	599641	599626	599626	You	0	" said Richard ; "
599666	599667	599656	599656	I	0	" "
599678	599683	599684	599684	you	16269	" said the maiden , "
599688	599689	599684	599684	you	16269	" "
599702	599706	599690	599690	I	0	" continued Markham . "
599779	599780	599808	599808	him	14905	" "
599791	599804	599805	599805	I	0	" ejaculated Katherine , clasping her hands together in token of gratitude . "
599815	599819	599805	599805	I	0	" proceeded Markham ; "
599827	599828	599824	599825	a child	5166	" "
599841	599845	599832	599832	His	16282	" murmured Katherine . "
599887	599888	599889	599889	You	0	" "
599911	599924	599901	599901	you	0	" cried Katherine , her heart glowing with gratitude towards our hero . "
599940	599948	599938	599938	Katherine	1413	" said Richard , with a smile . "
599955	599963	599952	599952	me	0	" exclaimed the amiable girl , joyfully . "
600014	600015	600055	600055	cousin	15043	" "
600030	600034	600055	600055	cousin	15043	" said Katherine . "
600047	600051	600036	600036	I	0	" continued Richard . "
600067	600068	600055	600055	cousin	15043	" "
600072	600076	600055	600055	cousin	15043	" said Katherine . "
600085	600086	600081	600082	his father	26629	" "
600094	600104	600055	600055	cousin	15043	" added Markham , seeing that the maiden hesitated . "
600128	600129	600130	600130	He	14905	" "
600148	600152	600136	600136	he	14905	" said Kate . "
600241	600242	600245	600245	you	0	" "
600256	600260	600245	600245	you	0	" said Katherine , "
600273	600274	600245	600245	you	0	" "
600288	600292	600275	600276	Your uncle	14905	" observed Richard . "
600335	600336	600307	600307	you	0	" "
600344	600355	600307	600307	you	0	" exclaimed Katherine , recoiling from the name in horror . "
600372	600376	600307	600307	you	0	" said Richard . "
600414	600415	600443	600443	your	0	" "
600425	600429	600443	600443	your	0	" said Katherine ; "
600451	600452	600443	600443	your	0	" "
600457	600461	600455	600455	Katherine	1413	" resumed Markham , "
600541	600542	600543	600543	I	0	" "
600561	600629	600548	600548	you	0	" said Katherine . At this moment an old man , dressed in a rustic garb , but with a good - natured countenance and venerable white hair , entered the room . This was the farmer himself . Katherine introduced Richard to him as her benefactor ; and the old man shook hands with our hero in a cordial manner , saying at the same time , "
600663	601099	600635	600636	Miss Kate	1413	" Richard thanked the good - natured rustic for the well - meant compliment , and then communicated to him the fact that his wife was entitled to a legacy of five hundred pounds , which would be paid to her order in the course of a few days . The old man was overjoyed at these tidings , although his countenance partially fell when he heard the source whence the bequest emanated ; but Richard convinced him that it would be unwise and absurd to refuse it . Mr. Bennet hastened up - stairs to communicate the news to his wife . While he was absent , the farmer 's servant - girl entered to spread the table for the afternoon 's repast . On the return of the old man to the room , the dinner was served up ; and our hero sat down to table with the farmer and Katherine . A happy meal was that ; and in the pure felicity which Katherine now enjoyed , Richard beheld to a considerable extent the results of his own goodness . How amply did the spectacle of that young creature 's happiness reward him for all that he had done in her behalf ! It was four o'clock in the afternoon when our hero took his leave of the old farmer and Miss Wilmot , in order to retrace his steps to Hounslow . The old farmer had offered to convey Richard to Hounslow in his own spring - cart , or to provide him with a guide to conduct him thither ; but our hero felt so confident of being enabled to find his way back to the town , that he declined both offers . He walked on , across the fields , pondering upon various subjects,—Isabella , his brother , Katherine , Reginald Tracy 's crimes , and the frightful suicide of Lady Cecilia Harborough,—and with his mind so intent upon these topics , that some time elapsed ere he perceived that he had fallen into a wrong path . He looked around ; but not an object of which he had taken notice in the morning , when proceeding to the farm , could he now discover . Thus he had lost the only means which could assist his memory in regaining the road . As he stood upon a little eminence , gazing around to find some clue towards the proper direction which he should follow , a light blue wreath of smoke , rising from behind a hill at a short distance , met his eyes . "
601107	601113	600635	600636	Miss Kate	1413	" he said to himself ; "
601133	601369	600635	600636	Miss Kate	1413	" Towards the light blue cloud which curled upwards , Markham directed his steps ; but when he reached the brow of the hill , from the opposite side of which the smoke at first met his eye , he perceived , instead of a cottage as he expected , an encampment of gipsies . A covered van stood near the spot where two men , two women , and a boy were partaking of a meal , the steam of which impregnated the air with a powerful odour of onions . The caldron , whence the mess was served up in earthenware vessels , was suspended by means of stakes over a cheerful wood - fire . We need attempt no description of the persons of those who were partaking of the repast : it will be sufficient to inform the reader that they consisted of King Zingary , Queen Aischa , Morcar , Eva , and this latter couple 's son . They were , however , totally unknown to Richard : but the moment he saw they were of the gipsy tribe , he determined to glean from them any thing which they might know and might choose to reveal concerning the Resurrection Man . He therefore accosted them in a civil manner , and , stating that he had lost his way , inquired which was the nearest path to Hounslow . "
601385	601405	601378	601379	young gentleman	16306	" answered Zingary , stroking his long white beard in order to impress Richard with a sense of veneration ; "
601418	601419	601407	601408	my grandson	16307	" "
601426	601442	601421	601421	I	0	" exclaimed the boy , starting from the ground , and preparing to set off . "
601457	601461	601445	601446	the gentleman	27107	" observed Morcar . "
601468	601479	601463	601463	you	16305	" said Markham , whose purpose this invitation just suited , "
601517	601518	601519	601520	The gentleman	27107	" "
601526	601530	601524	601524	Morcar	1364	" said Zingary : "
601540	601611	601524	601524	Morcar	1364	" The King 's son hastened to the van to fetch the bottle of spirits ; and Markham could not help observing his fine , tall , well - knit frame , to which his dark Roman countenance gave an additional air of manliness — even of heroism . Richard partook of the spirits , in order to ingratiate himself with the gipsies ; and King Zingary then called for his "
601614	601615	601524	601524	Morcar	1364	" "
601624	601635	601616	601616	You	16305	" observed Richard , by way of encouraging a conversation . "
601645	601649	601642	601643	young gentleman	16306	" answered Zingary ; "
601660	601661	601642	601643	young gentleman	16306	" "
601674	601678	601671	601672	a King	16314	" asked Markham . "
601692	601701	601679	601679	I	0	" said Zingary , in a stately manner . "
601735	601814	601732	601733	my grandson	16307	" Richard started when these names fell upon his ears ; for they had been mentioned to him by Skilligalee in the Palace of the Holy Land . He also remembered to have been informed that it was in consequence of something which the Resurrection Man told Aischa , when she was attending to his wound , that the gipsies took him with them when they removed from the Palace to the encampment near the Penitentiary at Pentonville . "
601829	601847	601815	601815	I	0	" said Richard , with a bow — an act of courtesy which greatly pleased King Zingary . "

601876	601892	601855	601870	some of your subjects for a night 's lodging at your establishment in St. Giles 's	16325	" exclaimed the King ; and now all the gipsies surveyed Richard with some interest . "

604284	604395	604396	604396	You	16453	" Richard now rose to take leave of the hospitable and entertaining family in whose society he had thus passed an hour ; and , as it was growing dark , Morcar himself offered to conduct our hero as far as Hounslow . This proposal was gladly accepted ; and Markham , having taken leave of the King , Aischa , and Eva , set out with Morcar . In the course of three - quarters of an hour they reached the precincts of the town . Richard forced a handsome remuneration upon the gipsy , and reminded him of the promise made by his father concerning the Resurrection Man . "
604402	604406	604277	604282	a Grand , or Great Lord	16452	" said Morcar : "
604435	604543	604423	604426	many on the alert	16455	" The gipsy then turned to retrace his steps towards the encampment ; and Richard proceeded to the inn , where he obtained a conveyance for London . On the following evening Smithers presented himself , according to appointment , at Markham Place . Richard received him in the library , and treated him altogether with a condescension and a degree of kindness which made a deep impression on the mind of the executioner . Our hero then proceeded to acquaint him with the good fortune of Katharine , and the arrangement which had been made to supply him with the means to establish him in business . "
604562	604566	604553	604553	you	16457	" said Richard . "

604733	604737	604722	604722	she	1413	" answered Richard ; "
604777	604778	604812	604812	she	1413	" "
604789	604793	604812	604812	she	1413	" exclaimed Smithers ; "
604820	604835	604812	604812	she	1413	" And for a few moments Smithers appeared to be absorbed in deep thought . "
604853	604861	604871	604871	you	26649	" he continued , suddenly breaking silence ; "
604911	604912	604914	604915	your niece	16467	" "
604917	604921	604914	604915	your niece	16467	" ejaculated Richard . "
604931	604935	604914	604915	your niece	16467	" replied Smithers . "
604963	604964	604956	604956	Kate	1413	" "
604976	605009	604966	604966	she	1413	" said Markham , who was not altogether displeased to learn that the young female for whom he experienced a fraternal interest , was not even a connexion of the Public Executioner . "
605025	605029	605032	605032	you	26649	" continued Smithers ; "
605049	605050	605041	605041	I	0	" "
605053	605057	605058	605058	I	0	" said Markham . "

605090	605094	605081	605081	I	0	" resumed Smithers ; "
605108	605128	605129	605129	My	0	" Smithers settled himself in a comfortable position in his chair , and then related the following history : — "
605431	605449	605450	605450	Wilmot	1432	" Smithers paused for a moment , heaved a deep sigh , and then continued thus : — "
605610	605619	605620	605620	I	0	" Again Smithers paused for a few moments . "
605627	605631	605620	605620	I	0	" he continued , "
605819	605820	605797	605797	I	0	" "
605828	605832	605821	605821	You	16507	" observed Markham ; "

605852	605856	605858	605858	I	0	" said Smithers ; "

605986	605990	605961	605961	I	0	" said Markham , "

606697	606709	606691	606691	I	0	" Smithers uttered these words in a tone of deep feeling . "
606718	606722	606710	606710	I	0	" he continued ; "
607116	607146	607147	607147	Our	16556	" Smithers passed his hand over his forehead , as if to alleviate the acuteness of painful recollections . He then pursued his narrative in the following manner : — "
607289	607321	607278	607278	I	0	" Richard drew his chair , by a mechanical movement as it were , closer to that of the executioner , and prepared to listen with redoubled attention , if possible . "
607330	607334	607381	607381	She	27323	" continued Smithers , "
607723	607747	607720	607721	Harriet Wilmot	1432	" The executioner paused , averted his head for a moment , and wiped away a tear . He then continued his narrative . "
608389	608407	608380	608380	me!—I	0	" Here Smithers covered his face with his hands , and the tears trickled through his fingers . "
608422	608431	608408	608409	The lodgers	27602	" he continued , after a long pause ; "
608563	608604	608548	608548	she	27323	" Again the miserable man paused , and gave way to his emotions . Several minutes elapsed ere he continued his narrative ; and Markham also remained wrapped in a profound silence . At length the executioner proceeded thus : — "
608814	608815	608797	608797	she	1432	" "
608837	608842	608816	608816	I	0	" interrupted our hero . "
608863	608867	608860	608861	Mr. Markham	874	" said Smithers . "
608870	608874	608860	608861	Mr. Markham	874	" replied Richard . "
608886	608887	608875	608879	The late Mr. Reginald Tracy	1354	" "
608901	608906	608907	608907	She	2916	" continued the executioner . "

609048	609052	609030	609030	you	16660	" inquired Richard . "

609164	609165	609153	609153	you	16660	" "
609168	609172	609153	609153	you	16660	" answered Smithers . "
609277	609278	609273	609273	her	31879	" "
609282	609286	609273	609273	her	31879	" said Richard . "
609750	609751	609755	609757	my good friend	29199	" "
609767	609771	609755	609757	my good friend	29199	" said Richard . "
609781	609785	609788	609788	you	29199	" exclaimed Smithers ; "
609820	609821	609814	609814	I	0	" "
609828	609834	609835	609835	you	29199	" said Markham , kindly , "
609875	609876	609877	609877	I	0	" "
609891	609903	609877	609877	I	0	" observed Smithers , sinking his voice to a mysterious whisper : "
609911	609912	609904	609904	I	0	" "
609916	609926	609929	609930	Mr. Markham	874	" repeated Richard , surprised at this strange announcement . "
609982	609983	609984	609985	Another face	16702	" "
609987	609991	609994	609994	you	0	" ejaculated Markham : "
609997	609998	609994	609994	you	0	" "
610017	610025	610005	610006	Harriet Wilmot	1432	" answered Smithers , with a shudder . "
610030	610034	610005	610006	Harriet Wilmot	1432	" said Markham , "
610294	610295	610322	610322	you	29199	" "
610314	610318	610311	610311	you	29199	" said Smithers . "

610373	610377	610369	610369	My	0	" said Richard , "
610480	610793	610468	610468	you	16720	" Smithers promised to obey our hero 's desires in all respects , and then took his leave,—wondering how any human being could possess such influence over the heart , to humanize and reclaim it , as Richard Markham . In order to avoid unnecessary details we shall now concisely state that Smithers and his son paid the visit agreed upon to Katherine Wilmot . Smithers communicated to her , when they were alone together for half an hour , so much of his own history as involved all the particulars with which he was acquainted concerning her parentage . The grateful girl expressed a deeper sense of obligation than she had ever yet experienced towards the individual who had supported her for so many years , although she had no claims of relationship upon him . After one of the most agreeable days which the late executioner and his son had ever passed in their lives , they took leave of Katherine and the worthy people of the farm , and returned to London . Poor Katherine Wilmot ! she had that day learnt more concerning her parentage than she had ever known before ; but she would have been happier , perhaps , had her original impressions on that subject never been disturbed ! Still Markham had conceived it to be a duty which was owing to the young maiden , to permit Smithers thus to reveal to her those circumstances which seemed to fix her with the stigma of illegitimacy . That night her pillow was moistened with abundant tears , as she lay and reflected upon her lamented mother ! On the appointed evening Smithers and his son called at Markham Place . They were conducted by Whittingham to a parlour , where the table was spread with a handsome collation , places being arranged for three persons . "
610800	610818	610468	610468	you	16720	" said Richard Markham , who received them with a warmth far more encouraging than mere courtesy : "
610835	610836	610839	610839	sir	26649	" "
610841	610845	610847	610847	you	26649	" ejaculated Smithers ; "
610856	610857	610847	610847	you	26649	" "
610864	610868	610847	610847	you	26649	" answered Richard : "
610877	611025	610873	610875	a regenerated man	16726	" John Smithers ( for we shall suppress his nickname of Gibbet , as his father had already done so ) cast a glance of profound gratitude upon our hero , in acknowledgment of a behaviour that could not do otherwise than confirm his father in his anxious endeavours to adopt a course of mental improvement . Smithers ' confidence increased , when he had imbibed a glass or two of generous wine ; and he related to Markham the particulars of his interview with Katharine . Then was it for the first time the hump - back learnt that Katherine was not his cousin . He said nothing ; but , as he drank in all that fell from his father 's lips , two large tears rolled down his cheeks . When the supper was over , Richard addressed Smithers in the following manner : — "
611168	611172	611186	611186	your	16727	" proceeded Markham , "
611224	611359	611360	611360	We	16732	" After some hesitation , Smithers received the pocket - book . He and his son then took leave of Richard Markham , with the most sincerely felt expressions of gratitude , and with a promise from the father to write to him soon to state where and how they had settled themselves . Scarcely had those two individuals , now both made happy , taken their departure , when Whittingham informed his master that a person with a dark complexion , and who gave the name of Morcar , requested to speak to him . Richard ordered the gipsy to be instantly admitted to his presence . Morcar was accordingly shown into the parlour . The moment he found himself alone with Markham , he said in a low and somewhat solemn tone , "
611365	611366	611360	611360	We	16732	" "
611379	611383	611374	611374	your	16733	" said Richard . "

612141	612145	612125	612127	The villain Tidkins	998	" observed Markham ; "

612511	612526	612527	612527	Tidkins	998	" said Markham , who had listened with interest and astonishment to these details , "

612592	612596	612582	612582	his	1395	" answered Morcar ; "

612655	612659	612649	612649	you	16818	" said Richard . "

612752	612813	612745	612745	I	0	" answered the gipsy ; and he took his departure . Moored at a wharf at the Rotherhithe side of the river Thames , nearly opposite Execution Dock , were several lighters and barges , all lying together . Along the upper part of the buildings belonging to the wharf were painted , in rude but gigantic letters , the following words:—"Mossop
612827	613450	612745	612745	I	0	" Mr. Mossop , the sole proprietor of this wharf , was by no means particular what goods he thus received , whence they came when he housed them , or whither they were going when he carted them . He asked no questions , so long as his commission and charges were duly paid . For the convenience of his numerous customers , he kept his office constantly open ; and either himself or his son Ben Mossop was in constant attendance . Indeed , Mr. Mossop did more business by night than by day . He was , however , a close man : he never put impertinent questions to any one who called to patronise him ; and thus his way of doing business was vastly convenient for all those who used his wharf or his store - houses . If a lighter arrived at that wharf , ostensibly with a freight of hay , but in reality with divers bales of cotton or other goods concealed beneath the dried grass , Mr. Mossop did not seem to think that there was any thing at all strange in this ; and if next day he happened to hear that a barge at a neighbouring wharf had been robbed of divers bales of cotton during the night , Mr. Mossop was too much of a gentleman to question the integrity of his customers . Even if every wall in Rotherhithe , Horselydown , and Bermondsey , were covered with placards announcing the loss of the bales , describing them to a nicety , and offering a reward for their recovery , Mr. Mossop never stopped to read one of them . On two or three occasions , when a police - officer called at his wharf and politely requested him just to honour the nearest magistrate with a visit , and enter into an explanation how certain goods happened to be found in his store - rooms , the said goods having been lost by other parties in an unpleasant manner , Mr. Mossop would put an enormous pair of spectacles upon his nose and a good face on the matter at the same time ; and it invariably happened that he managed to convince the bench of his integrity , but without in any way compromising those persons who might be in custody on account of the said goods . His son Ben was equally prudent and reserved ; and thus father and son were mighty favourites with all the river pirates who patronised them . Moreover , Mossop 's Wharf was most conveniently situate : the front looked , of course , upon the river ; the back opened into Rotherhithe Wall ; and Mossop 's carts were noted for the celerity with which they would convey goods away from the warehouse to the receivers in Blue Anchor Road or in the neighbourhood of Halfpenny Hatch . The father and son were also famous for the regularity and dispatch with which they executed business on pressing occasions . Thus , while Mossop senior would superintend the landing of goods upon the wharf , Mossop junior was stationed at the back gate , where it was his pleasing duty to see the bales speedily carted as they were brought through the warehouses by the lumpers employed . Mossop senior was also reputed to be a humane man ; for if any of his best customers got into trouble ( which was sometimes the case ) and were short of funds , a five pound note in a blank envelop would reach them in prison to enable them to employ counsel in their defence ; and this sum invariably appeared as "
613453	614107	612745	612745	I	0	" in Mossop 's next account against them when they were free once more , and enabled to land another cargo at the wharf . But to continue our narrative . It was the evening after the one on which Morcar had called at Markham Place ; consequently the evening of that day when the gipsy was to meet our hero on the Tower wharf . Over the particulars of that meeting we , however , pass ; as the plans then arranged will presently develop themselves . It was now about nine o'clock . The evening was beautiful and moonlight . Myriads of stars were rocked to and fro in the cradle of the river 's restless tide ; and the profiles of the banks were marked with thousands of lights , glancing through dense forests of masts belonging to the shipping that were crowded along those shores . At intervals those subdued murmurs which denoted that the river was as busy and active as the great city itself , were absorbed in the noise of some steamer ploughing its rapid way amidst the mazes of vessels that to the inexperienced eye appear to be inextricably entangled together . Then would arise those shouts of warning to the smaller craft,—those rapid commands to regulate the movements of the engines,—and those orders to the helmsman , which , emanating from the lips of the captain posted on the paddle - box , proclaim the progress of the steamer winding its way up the pool . A wondrous and deeply interesting spectacle , though only dimly seen , is that portion of the Thames on a moonlight night . Then indeed is it that even the most callous mind is compelled to contemplate with mingled astonishment and awe , one of the grandest features of the sovereign city and world 's emporium of trade . The gurgling water , and the countless masts,—the vibration of mighty engines on the stream , and the myriads of twinkling lights along the shores,—the cheering voices of the mariners , and the dense volumes of smoke which moving colossal chimneys vomit forth,—the metallic grating of windlasses , and the glittering of the spray beneath revolving wheels,—the flapping of heavy canvass , and the glare from the oval windows of steamers,—the cries of the rowers in endangered boats , and the flood of silver lustre which the moon pours upon the river 's bosom,—these form a wondrous complication of elements of interest for both ear and eye . The barge that was farthest off from Mossop 's wharf , of all the lighters moored there , and that could consequently get into the stream quicker than any other near it , was one to which we must particularly direct our readers ' attention . It was called the Fairy , and was large , decently painted , and kept in pretty good order . It had a spacious cabin abaft , and a smaller one , termed a cuddy , forward . The mast , with its large brown sail that seemed as if it had been tanned , was so fitted as to be lowered at pleasure , to enable the vessel to pass under the bridges at high water . The rudder was of enormous size ; and the tiller was as thick and long as the pole of a carriage . The waist , or uncovered part of the lighter in the middle , was now empty ; but it was very capacious , and adapted to contain an immense quantity of goods . On the evening in question two men were sitting on the windlass , smoking their pipes , and pretty frequently applying themselves to a can of grog which stood upon the deck near them . One was the Resurrection Man : the other was John Wicks , better known as the Buffer . "
614112	614118	614110	614110	Jack	1127	" said the Resurrection Man , "
614135	614136	614139	614139	I	0	" "
614157	614162	614144	614144	you	1127	" exclaimed the Buffer . "

614191	614197	614165	614165	I	0	" cried the Resurrection Man . "

614348	614353	614346	614346	Tony	1061	" said the Buffer , "
614378	614379	614371	614371	them	16834	" "
614400	614406	614392	614392	you	1061	" returned the Resurrection Man . "
614500	614501	614493	614493	he	1479	" "
614506	614511	614493	614493	he	1479	" said the Buffer . "

614558	614562	614553	614553	I	0	" answered Tidkins . "
614631	614632	614618	614618	they	16835	" "
614636	614658	614618	614618	they	16835	" observed the Buffer . At this period of the conversation , a woman 's head appeared above the cabin hatchway . "
614663	614667	614659	614659	Supper	1480	" she said . "
614674	614735	614672	614672	Moll	1264	" returned the Buffer . The two villains then descended into the cabin , where a well - spread table awaited them . Scarcely had the trio concluded their repast , when a man , who had come from the wharf and had walked across the barges until he reached the Fairy , called to Tidkins , by the appellation of "
614738	614743	614736	614736	Captain	16844	" from the hatchway . "
614747	614819	614736	614736	Captain	16844	" answered the Resurrection Man . The person thus invited was the foreman in Mr. Mossop 's employment . He was short , stout , and strongly built , with a tremendous rubicundity of visage , small piercing grey eyes , no whiskers , and a very apoplectic neck . His age might be about fifty ; and he was dressed in a light garb befitting the nature of his calling . "
614825	614840	614822	614823	Mr. Swot	1481	" said the Resurrection Man , as the little fat foreman descended the ladder ; "
614873	614874	614859	614859	you	1481	" "
614881	614891	614859	614859	you	1481	" returned Mr. Swot , as he seated himself . "

615024	615030	615011	615011	he	1478	" observed the Resurrection Man . "

615053	615059	615038	615038	I	0	" said the Resurrection Man . "
615070	615078	615066	615067	all friends	26996	" asked Swot , glancing around him . "
615081	615085	615066	615067	all friends	26996	" replied Tidkins . "
615110	615111	615093	615093	she	16854	" "
615116	615120	615093	615093	she	16854	" said Swot . "

615233	615253	615221	615221	I	0	" Mr. Swot emptied his mug at a draught , lighted a pipe , and then continued thus : — "
615294	615295	615299	615300	the men	2060	" "
615305	615309	615299	615300	the men	2060	" said Tidkins . "
615313	615318	615299	615300	the men	2060	" observed the Buffer , "
615330	615331	615299	615300	the men	2060	" "
615335	615340	615299	615300	the men	2060	" returned Mr. Swot . "

615435	615447	615428	615428	we	16868	" resumed Swot , helping himself to another supply of grog . "
615658	615659	615664	615665	the owners	32423	" "
615674	615682	615664	615665	the owners	32423	" said the Resurrection Man , interrogatively . "
615697	615701	615664	615665	the owners	32423	" answered Swot . "
615742	615743	615804	615804	I	0	" "
615753	615758	615746	615746	I	0	" said the Buffer . "
615763	615767	615768	615770	the Lady Anne	16880	" continued Swot , "

615807	615813	615804	615804	I	0	" answered the Resurrection Man . "

615843	615847	615837	615838	three men	14571	" returned Swot ; "
615873	615874	615858	615860	the Lady Anne	1482	" "
615878	615891	615858	615860	the Lady Anne	1482	" ejaculated the Resurrection Man and the Buffer in the same breath . "
615895	615904	615858	615860	the Lady Anne	1482	" repeated Moll Wicks , with a shudder . "
615910	615961	615858	615860	the Lady Anne	1482	" said Swot , coolly emptying his second mug of grog . There was a dead silence for some moments . It seemed as if the spirits of those who had listened with deep attention to the foreman 's narrative , were suddenly damped by the explanation that closed it . "
615968	615977	615965	615965	you	16873	" asked Swot , at length breaking silence . "
615980	615996	615965	615965	you	16873	" returned the Resurrection Man , throwing off the depression which had fallen upon him . "
616009	616010	616065	616065	God	880	" "
616021	616026	616012	616012	you	16873	" demanded the Buffer . "

616057	616061	616037	616037	you	16873	" said Moll . "
616084	616090	616082	616082	Jack	1127	" exclaimed the Resurrection Man . "
616098	616103	616082	616082	Jack	1127	" observed the foreman . "
616174	616175	616234	616234	you	16873	" "
616184	616190	616234	616234	you	16873	" said the Resurrection Man . "
616205	616206	616199	616199	you	16873	" "
616213	616218	616209	616209	I'll	16899	" answered Mr. Swot . "
616296	616297	616288	616288	they	16903	" "
616302	616308	616288	616288	they	16903	" said the Resurrection Man . "
616320	616321	616310	616310	you	16873	" "
616336	616340	616310	616310	you	16873	" answered Swot . "

616374	616574	616360	616360	I	0	" cried Tidkins . Mr. Swot then took his departure ; and the three persons whom he left behind in the lighter , continued their carouse . In this way the Resurrection Man , the Buffer , and Moll Wicks amused themselves until nearly eleven o'clock , when , just as they were thinking of retiring for the night,—Tidkins to his bed in the after cabin where they were then seated , and the other two to their berth in the cuddy forward,—the lighter was suddenly shaken from one end to the other by some heavy object which bumped violently against it . The collision was so powerful that the Buffer 's wife was thrown from her seat ; and every plank in the Fairy oscillated with a crashing sound . The Buffer and the Resurrection Man rushed upon the deck . A single glance enabled them to ascertain the cause of the sudden alarm . A lighter , nearly as large as the Fairy , and heavily laden , had been so clumsily brought in against the barges moored off the wharf , that it came with the whole weight of its broad - side upon the Fairy . "
616580	616606	616360	616360	I	0	" ejaculated the Buffer , applying this complimentary epithet to the two men who were on the deck of the lighter which was putting in . "
616616	616625	616608	616608	we	16909	" exclaimed one of the individuals thus addressed . "
616633	616638	616608	616608	we	16909	" answered the Buffer . "
616643	616644	616645	616646	The Blossom	16912	" "
616648	616653	616645	616646	The Blossom	16912	" was the reply . "
616659	616663	616645	616646	The Blossom	16912	" demanded Wicks . "
616670	616683	616645	616646	The Blossom	16912	" cried the man , speaking in a surly and evasive manner . "
616704	616705	616645	616646	The Blossom	16912	" "
616710	616715	616645	616646	The Blossom	16912	" shouted the Buffer . "

616739	616795	616796	616796	We	16909	" said the man . While the Blossom was executing this manœuvre , which it did in a most clumsy manner , as if the two men that worked her had never been entrusted with the care of a lighter before , the Buffer turned towards the Resurrection Man , and said in a whisper , "
616836	616837	616832	616834	the Lady Anne	1482	" "
616842	616848	616832	616834	the Lady Anne	1482	" answered the Resurrection Man . "

617004	617009	616994	616996	a regular man	16921	" observed the Buffer . "

617045	617049	617040	617042	a reg'lar man	16924	" said Wicks . "
617075	617076	617077	617077	We	16920	" "
617085	617091	617077	617077	We	16920	" observed the Resurrection Man . "
617141	617142	617159	617164	the person to learn all this	16926	" "
617146	617151	617159	617164	the person to learn all this	16926	" returned the Buffer . "
617166	617172	617156	617156	you	1127	" continued the Resurrection Man . "
617256	617257	617258	617258	I	0	" "
617265	617272	617258	617258	I	0	" cried the Buffer , impatiently ; "
617341	617342	617450	617450	friend	38250	" "
617347	617351	617450	617450	friend	38250	" interrupted Tidkins : "
617392	617447	617363	617364	Those lubbers	16917	" The Buffer immediately proceeded to obey this order . He walked across the barges , which , as we before stated , were so closely moored together that they formed one vast floating pier ; and approaching as close as possible to the Blossom , without setting foot upon it , he said , "
617489	617490	617454	617454	You	38250	" "
617500	617548	617454	617454	You	38250	" answered the man who had before spoken . The Buffer now perceived that the other individual on board the Blossom , and who had charge of the helm , was a Black , of tall form , and dressed in the rough garb of a sailor . "
617554	617563	617549	617549	You	38250	" said the Buffer , after a pause . "
617569	617575	617549	617549	You	38250	" answered the first speaker . "
617585	617586	617577	617577	you	38250	" "
617592	617598	617577	617577	you	38250	" was the laconic reply . "
617606	617607	617603	617603	your	38250	" "
617612	617617	617603	617603	your	38250	" returned the man . "
617629	617634	617621	617621	you	0	" continued the Buffer . "
617637	617643	617621	617621	you	0	" was the brief answer . "
617652	617656	617621	617621	you	0	" observed Wicks . "
617664	617665	617658	617658	you	0	" "
617673	617678	617666	617666	I	0	" replied the master . "
617685	617692	617666	617666	I	0	" said the Buffer , with a laugh,—"I

617710	617715	617695	617695	he	16936	" returned the master . "
617725	617726	617719	617719	he	26667	" "
617733	617738	617719	617719	he	26667	" repeated the Buffer . "

617755	617762	617753	617753	you	0	" said the master , significantly . "
617769	617789	617765	617765	I	0	" cried Wicks , who now felt convinced that the Blossom was not a whit better than the Fairy . "
617802	617803	617800	617800	Blackee	1484	" "
617815	617822	617800	617800	Blackee	1484	" said the master , gruffly . "
617828	617833	617800	617800	Blackee	1484	" observed the Buffer . "
617875	617876	617867	617867	I	0	" "
617886	617891	617877	617877	You	0	" said the master . "
617901	617961	617877	617877	You	0	" The Buffer did not hesitate to accept this invitation . The Black had lighted his pipe , and was lounging on the deck over the after cabin . The master disappeared down the hatchway of the small cabin , or cuddy , forward ; and in a few moments he returned with a bottle and two tin pannikins . "
617970	617991	617992	617993	The Fairy	1483	" he said , as he poured out the liquor , which exhaled the strong and saccharine flavour of rum . "
617995	618000	617992	617993	The Fairy	1483	" replied the Buffer . "
618010	618011	618007	618008	the Fairy	1483	" "
618019	618033	618016	618017	the Blossom	1333	" The master and the Buffer each took draughts of the raw spirit . "
618043	618048	618036	618036	us	16944	" said the master . "
618063	618064	618051	618060	an honest , open - hearted kind of a feller	16946	" "
618072	618076	618051	618060	an honest , open - hearted kind of a feller	16946	" interrupted Wicks . "
618086	618109	618083	618083	you	0	" said the master , speaking deliberately , as if he were meditating upon some particular idea which then occupied his mind ; "
618147	618148	618149	618149	You	0	" "
618158	618163	618149	618149	You	0	" returned the Buffer . "

618210	618214	618191	618191	He	1478	" answered Wicks . "
618223	618228	618191	618191	He	1478	" returned the master . "

618363	618368	618357	618358	a man	2001	" demanded the master : "
618375	618376	618369	618373	one of the right kind	16958	" "
618391	618396	618382	618382	him	16957	" answered the Buffer . "

618466	618471	618459	618459	we	16959	" said the master . "
618495	618502	618505	618505	we	16959	" remarked the Buffer , interrogatively . "
618513	618518	618505	618505	we	16959	" answered the master . "
618522	618523	618505	618505	we	16959	" "
618527	618539	618505	618505	we	16959	" said Wicks ; and he then returned to the Fairy . "
618549	618565	618542	618542	you	0	" demanded the Resurrection Man , who was smoking his pipe on the after deck . "
618575	618580	618573	618573	Tony	1061	" was the reply . "
618676	618677	618647	618647	he	27285	" "
618686	618694	618678	618678	You	0	" exclaimed the Resurrection Man , hastily . "
618715	618716	618706	618706	I	0	" "
618726	618732	618706	618706	I	0	" observed the Resurrection Man ; "
618760	618797	618798	618798	I	0	" It wanted half - an - hour to day - break , when the splash of oars alongside met their ears ; and in a few moments Swot , the foreman , made his appearance . "
618809	618814	618798	618798	I	0	" said that individual ; "
618826	618827	618820	618822	two stout chaps	16971	" "
618834	618844	618829	618829	they	16972	" demanded the Resurrection Man , thereby meaning pistols . "
618849	618854	618829	618829	they	16972	" replied the foreman . "
618884	618885	618877	618877	I	0	" "
618889	618894	618877	618877	I	0	" cried the Buffer . "
618909	618910	618899	618899	you	950	" "
618927	618932	618911	618911	You	950	" observed the woman . "
618935	618940	618941	618942	Some one	27192	" answered her husband . "
618954	618955	618941	618942	Some one	27192	" "
618971	618975	618964	618965	a coward	3497	" exclaimed Moll . "
618984	618990	618976	618976	We	16974	" said the Resurrection Man . "
619006	619007	619000	619000	we	16974	" "
619019	619030	619008	619008	You	0	" returned Swot , to whom this question was addressed . "
619064	619065	619008	619008	You	0	" "
619068	619152	619008	619008	You	0	" answered Tidkins . The three men then ascended to the deck . The dawn was at that moment breaking in the east ; and every moment mast after mast on the stream , and roof after roof on the shore , appeared more palpably in the increasing light of the young day . On board of the Blossom , the Black was busily employed in washing the deck , and seemed to take no notice of any thing that was passing elsewhere . "
619164	619168	619008	619008	You	0	" said Tidkins . "
619178	619826	619171	619171	we	16974	" The foreman retraced his steps across the barges to the wharf ; while the Resurrection Man and the Buffer , each armed with a pair of pistols , leapt into the boat , that lay alongside the lighter . Two stout fellows , dressed like watermen , and who were already seated in the boat , instantly plied their sculls . The skiff shot rapidly away from the vicinity of the barges , and was soon running down the middle of the river with a strong tide . The morning was beautiful and bright : a gentle breeze swept the bosom of the stream:—and when the sun burst forth in all its effulgent glory , a few fleecy clouds alone appeared on the mighty arch of blue above . Here and there the mariners on board the outward - bound vessels were busy in heaving up their anchors — a task which they performed with the usual cheering and simultaneous cry,—or in loosening the canvass that immediately became swollen with the breeze . At distant intervals some steamer , bound to a native or foreign port , walked , as it were , with gigantic strides along the water , raising with its mighty Briarean arms , a swell on either side , which made the smaller craft toss and pitch as if in a miniature whirlpool . Alas ! how many souls have found a resting - place in the depths of those waters ; and the spray of the billow seems the tears which old Father Thames sheds as a tribute to their graves ! Then , at dark midnight , when the wind moans over the bosom of the river , the plaintive murmurs sound as a lament for those that are gone ! Vain are thy tears , O River ! But if they must be shed , let them flow for the living , whose crimes or whose miseries may , with Orphic spell , awaken the sympathy of even inanimate things . The boat shot rapidly along , the sun gilding its broad pathway . What evidence of commercial prosperity appears on either side ! The clang of mighty hammers denote the progress of new vessels in the various building - yards ; and in the numerous docks the shipwright is busy in repairing the effects of past voyages , and rendering the gallant barks fit to dare the perils of the ocean once more ! The river - pirates , whose course we are following , pursued their way : the old Dreadnought , stripped of the cannon that once bristled on its lofty sides , and now resembling the worn - out lion that has lost its fangs , was passed;—the domes of Greenwich greeted the eye;—and now the boat merged upon the wide expanse which seems to terminate with Blackwall . But , no ! the stream sweeps to the right ; and onward floats the skiff — skirting the Kentish shore . At length the gloomy and sombre - looking hulks off Woolwich are reached : the boat shoots in between the shipping ; and there the pirates landed . At Woolwich they repaired to a low public - house with which they were acquainted ; and , as the fresh air of the river had sharpened their appetites , they called into request every article of food which was to be found in the larder . Liquors in due proportion were ordered ; the Resurrection Man paid the score for all ; and in this manner the four pirates contrived to while away the time until the tide turned once more in their favour in the afternoon . At three o'clock they retraced their steps to the boat ; and in a few minutes were again gliding rapidly along on the bosom of the river . "
619829	619835	619171	619171	we	16974	" said the Resurrection Man , "
619856	619876	619171	619171	we	16974	" These words were especially addressed to the two men whom the foreman at Mossop 's wharf had provided . "
619880	619886	619171	619171	we	16974	" continued the Resurrection Man , "
619955	619956	619961	619961	master	27070	" "
619963	619979	619980	619980	Swot	1481	" returned one , who was called Long Bob , in consequence of his height : "
619989	619990	619980	619980	Swot	1481	" "
620007	620052	619991	619991	We	16983	" added the other , who delighted in the name of the Lully Prig,[1 ] from the circumstance of his having formerly exercised the calling with which , in flash language , the name is associated , before he became a river - pirate . "
620059	620065	620056	620057	each other	2546	" said the Resurrection Man , "
620074	620076	620077	620077	We	16983	"[2 ] "
620089	620095	620077	620077	We	16983	" answered the Lully Prig ; "
620119	620120	620086	620087	old feller	3550	" "
620127	620133	620086	620087	old feller	3550	" said the Resurrection Man . "
620182	620184	620185	620185	We	16983	"[5 ] "
620192	620197	620185	620185	We	16983	" said Long Bob . "
620234	620236	620199	620199	Swot	1481	"[7 ] "
620257	620263	620269	620269	they	16994	" exclaimed the Lully Prig ; "
620293	620294	620199	620199	Swot	1481	" "
620302	620308	620199	620199	Swot	1481	" exclaimed the Resurrection Man . "
620324	620497	620199	620199	Swot	1481	" On went the boat with increased rapidity , the Lully Prig and Long Bob plying the oars with strength and skill . Then , when they were wearied , the Resurrection Man and the Buffer took their turns . Occasionally Tidkins handed round his flask , which he had taken good care to have replenished with rum at Woolwich ; and at intervals the Buffer or the Lully Prig cheered their labours with a song . In this manner Erith was reached and passed:—Greenhithe and Ingress Abbey , the front of which splendid mansion is built with the stones of old London Bridge , were in due course left behind;—and soon the antique windmill and the tall tower of Gravesend greeted the eyes of the river - pirates . At the two piers of the town were numerous steam - packets;—there were large merchant - vessels riding at anchor in the middle of the river;—and , on the opposite side , Tilbury Fort commanded the expanse of water with its cannon . "
620509	620515	620199	620199	Swot	1481	" said the Resurrection Man , "
620528	620529	620199	620199	Swot	1481	" "
620534	620840	620199	620199	Swot	1481	" returned the Buffer . The boat continued its course ; and in a short time it was made fast to the little jetty which affords a convenient means of landing at the point mentioned . The Lobster Tavern is a small isolated place of entertainment , upon the bank of the Thames , and is chiefly frequented by those good folks who , in fine weather , indulge in a trip on Sundays from London to Gravesend . There are sheds , with seats , built in front of the tavern ; and on a calm summer 's evening , the site and view are pleasant enough . The four pirates entered the establishment , and called for refreshments . They thus passed away the time until ten o'clock , when Mossop 's foreman joined them . In another half - hour they were all five seated in the boat ; and , in the darkness of the night , they bent their way towards the plague - ship . They kept close along the Kentish shore ; and when Swot imagined that they must be within half - a - mile of the place where the Lady Anne was stranded , the oars were muffled . The sky was covered with dense black clouds : no moon and not a star appeared . The water seemed as dark as ink . But the foreman knew every inlet and every jutting point which marked the course of the Thames ; and , with the tiller in his hand , he navigated the boat with consummate skill . Not a word was spoken ; and the faint murmurs of the oars were drowned in the whistling of the breeze which now swept over the river . At length the foreman said in a low whisper , "
620851	620893	620894	620894	We	17000	" At a distance of about a quarter of a mile that light appeared , like a solitary star upon the waters . Sometimes it moved — then stopped , as the quarantine officers rowed , or rested on their oars . "
620907	620916	620903	620905	the Lady Anne	1482	" whispered Swot , after another long pause : "
620922	621106	620903	620905	the Lady Anne	1482	" The Buffer cautiously raised a plank at the bottom of the boat , and drew forth , one after another , five cutlasses . These the pirates silently fastened to their waists . The boat moved slowly along ; and in another minute it was by the side of the plague ship . The Resurrection Man stretched out his arm , and his hand swept its slimy hull . There was not a soul upon the deck of the Lady Anne ; and , as if to serve the purposes of the river - pirates , the wind blew in strong gusts , and the waves splashed against the bank and the vessel itself , with a sound sufficient to drown the noise of their movements . The bow of the Lady Anne lay high upon the bank : the stern was consequently low in the water . As cautiously as possible the boat was made fast to a rope which hung over the schooner 's quarter ; and then the five pirates , one after the other , sprang on board . "
621109	621265	620903	620905	the Lady Anne	1482	" cried a boy , suddenly thrusting his head above the hatchway of the after cabin . Long Bob 's right hand instantly grasped the boy 's collar , while his left was pressed forcibly upon his mouth ; and in another moment the lad was dragged on the deck , where he was immediately gagged and bound hand and foot . But this process had not been effected without some struggling on the part of the boy , and trampling of feet on that of the pirates . Some one below was evidently alarmed , for a voice called the boy from the cabin . Long Bob led the way ; and the pirates rushed down into the cabin , with their drawn cutlasses in their hands . There was a light below ; and a man , pale and fearfully emaciated , started from his bed , and advanced to meet the intruders . "
621277	621287	621288	621288	Rascal	1488	" cried Long Bob , drawing forth a pistol . "
621295	621300	621292	621292	you	17002	" ejaculated the other ; "
621331	621332	621323	621323	you	17002	" "
621341	621393	621333	621333	We	17006	" answered Long Bob . Then , dropping his weapons , he sprang upon the surgeon , whom he threw upon the floor , and whose mouth he instantly closed with his iron hand . The pirates then secured the surgeon in the same way as they had the boy above . "
621400	621404	621333	621333	We	17006	" cried Swot . "
621424	621480	621412	621414	One of you	17008	" The Lully Prig volunteered this service ; and the other pirates repaired to the cabin forward . They well knew that the plague - stricken invalids must be there ; and when they reached the hatchway , there was a sudden hesitation — a simultaneous pause . The idea of the pestilence was horrible . "
621483	621488	621501	621501	God	880	" said the foreman , "
621493	621494	621498	621498	I	0	" "
621503	621646	621501	621501	God	880	" ejaculated the Resurrection Man ; and he sprang down the ladder . The others immediately followed him . But there was no need of cutlass , pistol , or violence there . By the light of the lamp suspended to a beam , the pirates perceived two wretched creatures , each in his hammock,—their cadaverous countenances covered with large sores , their hair matted , their eyes open but glazed and dim , and their wasted hands lying like those of the dead outside the coverlids , as if all the nervous energy were defunct . Still they were alive ; but they were too weak and wretched to experience any emotion at the appearance of armed men in their cabin . The atmosphere which they breathed was heated and nauseous with the pestilential vapours of their breath and their perspiration . "
621655	621701	621501	621501	God	880	" said the Resurrection Man , with a visible shudder . The pirates were only too glad to emerge from that narrow abode of the plague ; and never did air seem more pure than that which they breathed when they had gained the deck . "
621707	621711	621501	621501	God	880	" cried Swot . "
621719	621740	621742	621742	we	17012	" he continued , stopping at that which covered the compartment of the ship where the freight was stowed away ; "
621788	621948	621784	621785	the guard	17016	" The hatch was raised without much difficulty : a rope was then made fast to a spar and lowered into the waist of the schooner ; and Long Bob slid down . In a few moments he lighted his dark lantern ; and the other three descended one after the other , the Lully Prig , be it remembered , having remained in the after cabin . And now to work they went . The goods , with which the schooner was laden , were removed , unpacked , and ransacked . There were gums , and hides , and various other articles which the western coast of Africa produces ; but the object of the pirates ' enterprise and avarice was the gold - dust , which was contained in two heavy cases . These were , however , at the bottom of all the other goods ; and nearly an hour passed before they were reached . "
621957	621975	621784	621785	the guard	17016	" cried Swot , when every thing was cleared away from above the cases of precious metal . "
621989	621990	621978	621978	Tony	1061	" "
622002	622018	621991	621991	I	0	" answered the Resurrection Man , as he took a long sup of the spirit . "
622032	622033	622019	622019	I	0	" "
622037	622042	622019	622019	I	0	" said the foreman : "
622079	622146	622060	622061	Long Bob	1486	" The four men bent forward to the task ; and as they worked by the dim light of the lantern , in the depths of the vessel , they seemed to be four demons in the profundities of their own infernal abode . Suddenly the Resurrection Man staggered , and , supporting himself against the side of the vessel , said in a thick tone , "
622160	622161	622154	622154	I	0	" "
622172	622176	622154	622154	I	0	" cried Swot . "
622186	622198	622179	622179	I	0	" said Tidkins , seating himself on a bale of goods ; "
622211	622244	622179	622179	I	0	" The Buffer , the foreman , and Long Bob were suddenly and simultaneously inspired with the same idea ; and they cast on their companion looks of mingled apprehension and horror . "
622252	622256	622179	622179	I	0	" ejaculated Swot . "
622268	622276	622263	622263	he	0	" said Bob , with a shudder . "
622280	622292	622263	622263	he	0	" returned the Buffer , in a tone of indescribable terror . "
622300	622329	622295	622296	a fool	3208	" exclaimed the Resurrection Man , glaring wildly upon his comrades , and endeavouring to rise from his seat . But he fell back , exhausted and powerless . "
622332	622350	622295	622296	a fool	3208	" he muttered in a low but ferocious tone ; and he gnashed his teeth with rage . "
622354	622377	622378	622379	The coward	17024	" repeated the Buffer , now unable to contain his fears . Then he hastily clambered from the hold of the schooner . "
622381	622385	622435	622436	My God	27430	" cried Swot : "
622396	622434	622435	622436	My God	27430	" But as he yet spoke , Long Bob , influenced by panic fear , sprang after the Buffer , as if Death itself were at his heels , clad in all the horrors of the plague . "
622444	622463	622464	622467	Every man for himself	17026	" cried the Resurrection Man , his voice losing its thickness and assuming the piercing tone of despair . "
622472	622496	622497	622498	The cowards	17027	" returned Swot , whom the panic had now robbed of all his courage ; and in another moment he also had disappeared . "
622503	622608	622497	622498	The cowards	17027	" said Tidkins , clenching his fists with rage . Then , by an extraordinary and almost superhuman effort , he raised himself upon his legs : but they seemed to bend under him . He , however managed to climb upon the packages of goods ; and , aided by the rope , lifted himself up to the hatchway . But the effort was too great for his failing strength : his hands could not retain a firm grasp of the cord ; and he fell violently to the bottom of the hold , rolling over the bales of merchandize in his descent . "
622614	622671	622497	622498	The cowards	17027	" he mattered to himself ; and then he became rapidly insensible . Meantime the Lully Prig , who was mounting sentry upon the surgeon in the after cabin , was suddenly alarmed by hearing the trampling of hasty steps over head . He rushed on deck , and demanded the cause of this abrupt movement . "
622675	622709	622497	622498	The cowards	17027	" cried the Buffer , as he leapt over the ship 's quarter into the boat . The Lully Prig precipitated himself after his comrade ; and the other two pirates immediately followed . "
622716	622732	622733	622733	Tidkins	1061	" said the Lully Prig , as the boat was pushed away from the vessel . "
622739	622923	622733	622733	Tidkins	1061	" answered the Buffer , his teeth chattering with horror and affright . Fortunately the police - boat was at a distance ; and the pirates succeeded in getting safely away from that dangerous vicinity . But the Resurrection Man remained behind in the plague - ship ! We must now return to the Blossom — the lighter which had only arrived at Mossop 's wharf the night before the incidents of the last chapter occurred . When the boat which conveyed the pirates to Gravesend had pushed away from the Fairy at day - break , as already described , the Black , who was cleaning the deck of the Blossom , cast from beneath his brows a rapid and scrutinising glance at the countenances of the four men who were seated in that skiff . As soon as the boat was out of sight , the Black hastened down into the after - cabin of the Blossom , where a person was lying fast asleep in bed . The Black shook this person violently by the shoulder , and awoke him . "
622934	622939	622929	622929	sir,—I	0	" cried the Black . "
622942	622954	622929	622929	sir,—I	0	" cried Markham , starting up , and rubbing his eyes . "
622959	622960	622961	622961	He	17030	" "
622977	622981	622966	622971	three other men in a boat	17031	" answered Morcar ; "
622996	622997	622988	622988	him	17034	" "
623006	623010	623003	623004	the Fairy	40970	" exclaimed Richard . "
623013	623017	623003	623004	the Fairy	40970	" replied Morcar ; "
623028	623029	622988	622988	him	17034	" "
623035	623039	622988	622988	him	17034	" said Markham ; "
623049	623138	623044	623044	I	0	" The gipsy , who had so well disguised himself as a man of colour , hastened to the cuddy where Benstead was wrapped in the arms of Morpheus . The police - officer was delighted , when awakened and made acquainted with Morcar 's discovery , to find that the Resurrection Man had been thus recognised ; and he lost no time in dressing himself . The gipsy and Benstead afterwards proceeded to Richard 's cabin , where they found our hero just completing his hasty toilet . "
623146	623157	623044	623044	I	0	" said Markham , when they were all three assembled . "
623228	623229	623230	623230	My	0	" "
623239	623243	623230	623230	My	0	" observed Benstead . "
623367	623368	623374	623374	they	17046	" "
623385	623392	623374	623374	they	17046	" said Richard , half interrogatively . "
623403	623407	623374	623374	they	17046	" returned Benstead . "
623433	623434	623424	623424	Morcar	1364	" "
623445	623450	623438	623440	two other men	17053	" observed the gipsy . "
623471	623475	623454	623454	they	17053	" said Richard . "
623500	623501	623494	623494	they	17053	" "
623504	623508	623494	623494	they	17053	" exclaimed Benstead , "
623562	623563	623552	623552	Tidkins	1061	" "
623568	623572	623552	623552	Tidkins	1061	" said Markham . "
623633	623641	623627	623631	a deaf and dumb Black	17067	" continued Richard , with a smile ; "
623721	624013	624018	624019	the pirates	41119	" This advice was agreed to by Benstead and Morcar ; and while Richard remained below , the others took their turns in watching upon the deck . But all that day passed ; and the pirates did not come back to the Fairy — they being occupied in the manner related in the last chapter . Morcar undertook to keep watch during the night ; but hour after hour stole away,—another day dawned , and still the Fairy was occupied only by the woman whom the pirates had left behind . That day also passed ; and it was not until midnight that Morcar 's attention was attracted towards the Fairy . Then a boat rowed alongside of the pirate - barge . The night was pitch dark — so dark that Morcar could not see what was going on in the direction of the Fairy : but his ears were all attention . He was enabled to discover , by means of those organs , that the boat transferred one or more of its living freight ( but he could not tell how many ) to the Fairy : then a brief conversation was carried on in low whispers , but not a distinct word of which reached the gipsy . At length the boat pushed off , and rowed away up the river . Morcar stood upon the deck of the Blossom for a few minutes , attentively listening to catch a sound of any thing that might be passing on board the pirate lighter : but all continued silent in that quarter . Then Morcar descended to the cabin , where Richard and the policeman were waiting . To them he communicated the few particulars just narrated . "
624031	624036	624018	624019	the pirates	41119	" said our hero ; "
624087	624088	624089	624089	I	0	" "
624101	624106	624089	624089	I	0	" said the policeman ; "
624113	624232	624108	624108	Morcar	1364	" This was done ; Richard also retired to rest ; and the night passed away without any further adventure . But at day - break Morcar , who had again resumed the watch , observed some activity on board the Fairy . The Buffer and his wife were in fact making evident preparations for departure . They raised the mast by means of the windlass ; they shook out the sail ; fixed the tiller in the rudder , and performed the various preliminaries in a most business - like manner . Morcar speedily communicated these circumstances to Benstead and Markham ; and these three held a rapid consultation in the after - cabin of the Blossom . "
624253	624257	624259	624260	a soul	28621	" asked Markham . "
624262	624266	624259	624260	a soul	28621	" answered Morcar . "
624279	624280	624273	624273	Tidkins	1061	" "
624292	624293	624284	624284	He	1061	" "
624301	624305	624306	624306	Benstead	1454	" said Morcar . "
624315	624347	624312	624313	the man	2092	" observed Richard , after a pause . The policeman immediately left the cabin . He crossed the barges and approached the Fairy , which was just ready to put off . "
624353	624357	624306	624306	Benstead	1454	" cried Benstead : "
624364	624365	624358	624358	you	26696	" "
624377	624382	624368	624368	we're	17084	" answered the Buffer : "
624402	624403	624368	624368	we're	17084	" "
624410	624411	624368	624368	we're	17084	" "
624433	624434	624427	624427	you	26696	" "
624457	624461	624449	624449	I	0	" answered Benstead . "
624481	624486	624476	624476	you	26696	" said the Buffer , "
624526	624527	624517	624517	I	0	" "
624535	624539	624528	624528	You	26696	" said Benstead . "
624577	624578	624555	624556	your pal	16957	" "
624581	624587	624555	624556	your pal	16957	" answered the Buffer shortly . "
624666	624701	624657	624658	old feller	3550	" With these words the Buffer loosened the rope that held the Fairy alongside the barge next to it ; and then by means of a boat - hook he pushed the lighter off . "
624705	624717	624657	624658	old feller	3550	" exclaimed Benstead ; and he hastened back to the Blossom . "
624724	624738	624657	624658	old feller	3550	" asked Morcar , when these particulars were communicated to him and Richard . "
624758	624762	624752	624752	they	2109	" observed Benstead ; "
624775	624776	624765	624765	they	2109	" "
624790	624794	624780	624782	the Resurrection Man	3220	" added Markham . "
624809	624810	624803	624803	them	2109	" "
624827	624831	624820	624820	they	2109	" said Benstead ; "
624854	624855	624847	624847	he	3220	" "
624865	624869	624847	624847	he	3220	" observed Richard . "
624902	624903	624897	624897	we	17096	" "
624908	624973	624897	624897	we	17096	" said Benstead . This plan was immediately put into operation . The skiff was lowered : Markham , the policeman , and the gipsy leapt into it ; the two latter pulled the oars ; and our hero , muffled in a pilot coat , with the collar of which he concealed his countenance as much as possible , sate in the stern . "
624986	624990	624897	624897	we	17096	" said Richard . "
625027	625028	625021	625021	Tidkins	1061	" "
625033	625037	625021	625021	Tidkins	1061	" answered Benstead . "
625066	625339	625353	625353	her	17104	" The rowers had therefore little more to do than just play with their oars , as the tide bore the skiff along with even a greater rapidity than the lighter , although the latter proceeded with tolerable speed , in consequence of being empty , and having a fair breeze with it . Thus , when the boat drew too near the barge , the rowers backed their oars ; and by this manœuvring they maintained a convenient distance . On board the lighter , the Buffer and his wife were too busy with the management of their vessel — a task to which they were not altogether equal — to notice the watch and pursuit instituted by the little boat . In the manner described , the two parties pursued their way up the narrow space left by the crowds of shipping for the passage of vessels . The Tower was passed — that gloomy fortalice which has known sighs as full of anguish and hearts as oppressed with bitter woe as ever did the prisons of the Inquisition , or the dungeons of the Bastille . Then the Custom House was slowly left behind ; and Billingsgate , world - renowned for its slang , was passed by the pursued and the pursuer . To avoid the arch of London Bridge the Buffer lowered his mast ; and then midway between that and Southwark Bridge , his intentions became apparent . He was about to put in at a wharf on the Surrey side , where a large board on the building announced that lighters were bought or sold . "
625345	625349	625353	625353	her	17104	" cried Markham : "
625366	625423	625424	625424	I	0	" Benstead and Morcar plied the oars with a vigour which soon brought the boat within a few yards of the Fairy . The Buffer 's attention was now attracted to it for the first time ; but he did not immediately recognise the two rowers , because they had their backs turned towards the lighter . "
625430	625468	625427	625428	that man	3239	" suddenly exclaimed Richard , as he contemplated the Buffer , who was standing at the tiller , and who had his eyes fixed with some anxiety upon the boat , which was evidently pulling towards him . "
625471	625475	625476	625481	That man on board the lighter	17108	" asked Benstead . "
625483	625498	625499	625499	He	17108	" was the reply . Benstead cast a glance behind him , and said , "
625508	625509	625512	625512	him	17108	" "
625520	625524	625527	625527	he	17108	" cried Richard . "
625560	625616	625539	625539	he	17108	" These words Richard spoke aloud ; but they were unintelligible to his two companions , who were unacquainted with the incident referred to . They had no time to question him , nor had he leisure to explain his meaning to them ; for at that moment the boat shot alongside of the lighter . "
625619	625639	625640	625640	You	17112	" cried the Buffer , in alarm , as he recognised our hero who immediately sprang upon the deck . "
625644	625648	625640	625640	You	17112	" said Richard : "
625678	625679	625672	625672	I	0	" "
625685	625696	625682	625682	you	0	" asked the Buffer , somewhat reassured by these words . "
625700	625704	625682	625682	you	0	" replied Richard . "
625710	625720	625707	625708	my wife	27323	" ejaculated the Buffer , with a hoarse laugh . "
625729	625730	625727	625727	Moll	950	" "
625735	625740	625727	625727	Moll	950	" cried Richard sternly ; "
625767	625798	625763	625763	you	1454	" The Buffer cast looks of surprise and curiosity upon Richard 's companions , who , having made the boat fast to the lighter , had leapt upon the deck . "
625807	625816	625801	625801	you	1454	" cried Wicks , addressing himself to Benstead . "
625832	625833	625828	625828	you	1454	" "
625840	625845	625834	625834	I	0	" answered Benstead coolly . "
625875	625876	625866	625866	you	1454	" "
625884	625889	625866	625866	you	1454	" remarked the Buffer . "
625906	625907	625894	625895	your negro	17123	" "
625910	625920	625894	625895	your negro	17123	" replied Benstead , unable to suppress a smile . "
625932	625933	625894	625895	your negro	17123	" "
625943	625948	625949	625950	Your friend	26744	" asked the Buffer . "
625960	625961	625949	625950	Your friend	26744	" "
625970	626003	625963	625963	you	1454	" In the meantime , Richard and the gipsy had descended into the after - cabin ; and they now re - appeared upon the deck , their search having been fruitless . "
626009	626013	625963	625963	you	1454	" said Richard . "
626019	626050	626051	626051	I	0	" He and Morcar visited the cuddy ; but the Resurrection Man was evidently not in the lighter . They returned to the after deck ; and questioned the Buffer . "
626059	626087	626051	626051	I	0	" was the reply of that individual , who did not dare reveal the truth relative to the expedition to the plague ship , and its result ; "
626131	626139	626141	626142	a policeman	28229	" he added , pointing to Benstead , "
626144	626145	626141	626142	a policeman	28229	" "
626150	626154	626141	626142	a policeman	28229	" exclaimed Richard . "
626256	626257	626246	626246	he	998	" "
626262	626286	626246	626246	he	998	" said the Buffer , who had found time , while Richard thus spoke , to collect his ideas and invent a tale , "
626346	626347	626339	626339	Tidkins	998	" "
626352	626356	626349	626349	he	998	" demanded Richard . "
626359	626366	626349	626349	he	998	" answered the Buffer , boldly . "
626385	626386	626379	626379	he	998	" "
626395	626403	626379	626379	he	998	" said Benstead aside to our hero . "
626439	626440	626436	626436	his	27445	" "

626546	626571	626542	626542	my	0	" cried the Buffer , brutally . Markham turned away in disgust , and descended to the boat , followed by Morcar and Benstead . "
626585	626598	626580	626580	I	0	" said Richard , when they had pushed off from the Fairy ; "

626658	626662	626621	626621	his	17150	" observed Morcar . "

626691	626969	626970	626970	He	17153	" Return we now to one whom we have long left , but whom the reader can not have forgotten . In a sumptuously furnished room at the house of Mr. Wentworth , the surgeon of Lower Holloway , Diana Arlington was reclining upon a sofa . She was dressed in an elegant manner ; but a large black lace veil , doubled so as to render it more impervious to the eye of a beholder , was thrown over her head . The folds were also so arranged that the elaborately worked border completely concealed her countenance . She was alone . An open piano , a harp , and piles of music , together with a choice selection of volumes on the shelves of a book - case , denoted the nature of her amusements during her residence of several weeks at the surgeon 's abode . It was mid - day . The damask curtains at the windows were drawn in such a manner as to reduce the light of the effulgent sun to a mellow and soft lustre within that apartment . Beautiful nosegays of flowers imparted a delicious fragrance to the atmosphere . The bounty of the Earl of Warrington had furnished the room in a style of luxury which could scarcely be surpassed . But was Diana happy ? Were those sighs which agitated her heaving bosom,—was that restlessness which she now manifested,—was that frequent listening as the sounds of wheels passed along the road,—were all these signs of sorrow or of suspense ? Patience , gentle reader . The time - piece on the mantel had chimed mid - day . "
626975	626983	626970	626970	He	17153	" murmured Diana . Ten minutes elapsed . "
626989	627020	627023	627023	he	17153	" she said aloud . And her restlessness redoubled . At length a carriage drove rapidly up to the door ; and a long double knock reverberated through the house . "
627025	627041	627042	627042	Diana	889	" cried Diana . In a few moments the Earl of Warrington entered the room . "
627047	627066	627023	627023	he	17153	" exclaimed the nobleman , starting back when he beheld her countenance covered with that ominous dark veil : "
627073	627074	627023	627023	he	17153	" "
627085	627090	627093	627094	my lord	27330	" added the Enchantress . "
627105	627106	627096	627097	Mr. Wentworth	1209	" "
627111	627130	627109	627109	Diana	889	" answered the Earl , seating himself upon the sofa by her side , and taking her hand : "
627288	627289	627280	627280	I	0	" "
627296	627306	627293	627293	my	0	" asked Diana , in a soft plaintive tone . "
627326	627327	627308	627309	your lordship	28358	" "
627338	627350	627335	627335	you	0	" answered the nobleman , pressing her hand with warm affection . "
627363	627367	627361	627361	Diana	889	" he continued , "
627488	627489	627492	627493	my lord	27330	" "
627495	627504	627492	627493	my lord	27330	" said Diana , in a tremulous tone , "
627526	627527	627530	627530	Diana	889	" "
627540	627547	627530	627530	Diana	889	" answered the Earl , emphatically . "
627619	627620	627621	627621	My	0	" "
627633	627644	627621	627622	My lord	27330	" said Diana , in a tone of deep emotion . "
627844	627845	627846	627846	Diana	889	" "
627862	627867	627854	627854	I	0	" answered the Earl : "
627901	627902	627890	627890	you	889	" "
627909	627910	627890	627890	you	889	" "
627922	627929	627920	627920	Diana	889	" interrupted the Earl , warmly . "
627943	627957	627940	627940	I	0	" returned Diana , her voice thrilling with tones expressive of ineffable joy . "
627969	628025	627940	627940	I	0	" And as she spoke she slowly drew the black veil from her countenance . The nobleman 's heart palpitated , as she did so , with emotions of the most painful suspense — even of alarm : he felt like a man who in another instant must know the worst . The veil dropped . "
628030	628134	628028	628028	Diana	889	" exclaimed the Earl , starting with surprise and indescribable delight . For instead of a countenance seared and marked , he beheld a pure and spotless face glowing with a beauty which , even in her loveliest moments , had never seemed to invest her before . Not a scar — not a trace of the accident was visible . Her pouting lips were like the rose moistened with dew : her high , pale forehead was pure as marble ; and her cheeks were suffused in blushes which seemed to be born beneath the clustering ringlets of her dark brown hair . "
628139	628152	628137	628137	Diana	889	" exclaimed the Earl , as he drew her to his breast , "
628162	628163	628164	628164	You	0	" "
628169	628201	628164	628164	You	0	" she murmured , as she clasped her warm white arms around his neck , and imprinted a delicious kiss upon his lips , while her eyes were filled with a voluptuous languor,—"you
628218	628219	628213	628213	you	0	" "
628232	628237	628230	628230	Diana	889	" said the Earl . "
628259	628260	628230	628230	Diana	889	" "
628304	628324	628296	628296	I	0	" exclaimed Diana . These vows were sealed with innumerable kisses . At length the Earl rose to depart . "
628329	628333	628296	628296	I	0	" he said , "
628352	628353	628296	628296	I	0	" "
628361	628439	628296	628296	I	0	" returned Diana . The nobleman embraced her once more , and took his leave . But he did not immediately quit the house : he had business with Mr. Wentworth to transact . We know not the precise sum that this generous peer presented to the surgeon : this , however , we can assure our readers , that he kept his word to the very letter — for Mr. Wentworth became rich in one day . "
628449	628466	628441	628441	you	17175	" had the Earl said , when he first entrusted Diana to the surgeon 's care , "
628519	628586	628587	628587	I	0	" Such were the nobleman 's words upon that occasion ; and , on the present , he amply fulfilled his promise . Three days after , Diana became the Countess of Warrington . The happy news were thus communicated by the bride to her sincerest and best friend : — Grosvenor Square March 22nd , 1840 To Her Serene Highness the Grand Duchess of Castelcicala . "
628720	628896	628897	628897	I	0	" I regret to perceive by your letters , dearest Eliza , that you are not altogether happy . You say that the Grand Duke loves you ; but his temper is arbitrary — his disposition despotic . And yet he is amiable and gentle in his bearing towards you . Study to solace yourself with this conviction . He has elevated you to a rank amongst the reigning princesses of Europe ; and as you have embraced the honours , so must you endure some few of the political alarms and annoyances which are invariably attached to so proud a position . You tremble lest the conduct of the Grand Duke , in alienating from him those who are considered his best friends , should endanger his crown . Are you convinced that those persons are indeed his friends ! Of course I know not — I can not determine : I would only counsel you , my dearest friend , not to form hasty conclusions relative to the policy of his Serene Highness . "
628977	629045	629051	629052	dearest Eliza:—I	17189	" His Highness Alberto of Castelcicala—(for you are aware that the Earl of Warrington communicated to me some time ago the real rank and name of Count Alteroni)—continues to reside at his villa near Richmond . This much I glean from the public journals ; but doubtless you are well acquainted with all these facts , inasmuch as your government has a representative at the English court . "
629104	629110	629111	629111	DIANA	889	" Ever your sincere friend , "
629113	629551	629111	629111	DIANA	889	" Such are the strange phases which this world presents to our view ! That same Fortune , who , in a moment of caprice , had raised an obscure English lady to a ducal throne , placed , when in a similar mood , a coronet upon the brow of another who had long filled a most equivocal position in society . Some few days after the events just related , Mr. G. M. Greenwood , M.P. , entertained several gentlemen at dinner at his residence in Spring Gardens . The banquet was served up at seven precisely:—Mr . Greenwood had gradually made his dinner hour later as he had risen in the world ; and he was determined that if ever he became a baronet , he would never have that repast put on table till half - past eight o'clock . On the present occasion , as we ere now observed , the guests were conducted to the dining - room at seven . The thick curtains were drawn over the windows : the apartment was a blaze of light . The table groaned beneath the massive plate : the banquet was choice and luxurious in the highest degree . On Mr. Greenwood 's right sate the Marquis of Holmesford — a nobleman of sixty - three years of age , of immense wealth , and notorious for the unbounded licentiousness of his mode of life . His conversation , when his heart was somewhat warmed with wine , bore ample testimony to the profligacy of his morals : seductions were his boast ; and he frequently indulged in obscene anecdotes or expressions which even called a blush to the cheeks of his least fastidious male acquaintances . On Mr. Greenwood 's left was Sir T. M. B. Muzzlehem , Bart . , M.P. , and Whipper - in to the Tory party . Next to the two guests already described , sate Sir Cherry Bounce , Bart . , and the Honourable Major Smilax Dapper — the latter of whom had recently acquired a grade in the service by purchase . Mr. James Tomlinson , Mr. Sheriff Popkins , Mr. Alderman Sniff , Mr. Bubble , Mr. Chouse , and Mr. Twitchem ( a solicitor ) completed the party . Now this company , the reader will perceive , was somewhat a mixed one : the aristocracy of the West End , the civic authority , and the members of the financial and legal spheres , were assembled on the present occasion . The fact is , gentle reader , that this was a "
629555	629589	629111	629111	DIANA	889	" and that you may be no longer kept in suspense , we will at once inform you that when the cloth was drawn , Mr. Greenwood , in a brief speech , proposed "
629601	629610	629612	629612	your	17193	" The toast was drunk with great applause . "
629620	629628	629612	629612	your	17193	" said Mr. Twitchem , the solicitor , "

629665	629704	629658	629658	I	0	" cried the Honourable Major Dapper . The solicitor then drew a bundle of papers from his pocket , and in a business - like manner read the contents of one which he extracted from the parcel : — "

It will thus be the means of transit for passengers and traffic over a most important section of the Great Desert , which , though placed in maps in a more southernly latitude , nevertheless extends to the District through which this Line is to pass . "
629954	630027	629943	629943	his	17200	" The Morocco government ( one of the most enlightened in Africa ) has also assented to the enterprise ; and the Emperor , the better to manifest the favour with which he views the project , ordered his Prime Minister to be soundly bastinadoed for daring to question its practicability . This proof of the imperial wisdom has filled the Committee and friends of the enterprise with the most sanguine hopes . "
630048	630108	630109	630114	The ex - Emir of Mascara	17203	" The Emperor of Morocco , on one side , and his Excellency the Governor - General of Algeria , on the other , have signified their readiness to grant a strong armed force to protect the engineers and operatives , when laying down the rails , from being devoured by wild beasts , or molested by predatory tribes . "
630193	630243	630171	630172	the Committee	41474	" It is with the greatest satisfaction that the Committee of Direction is enabled to announce these brilliant prospects ; and the Committee beg to state that application for the allotment of Shares must be made without delay to James Tomlinson , Esq . , Stockbroker , Tokenhouse Yard .

630250	630256	630171	630172	the Committee	41474	" SHARPLY TWITCHEM , Secretary . "
630257	630278	630280	630281	Sir Cherry	1051	" On my thoul , there never wath any thing better — conthith , bwief , ekthplithit , and attwactive ! "
630283	630302	630304	630305	Major Dapper	1492	" Sure to take — as certain as I 'm in Her Majesty 's service — strike me ! "
630307	630321	630323	630324	the Marquis	17209	" I think you ought to have thrown in something about African beauties , "
630326	630360	630323	630324	the Marquis	17209	" they are particularly stout , you know , being all fed on a preparation of rice called couscousou . I really think I must pay a visit to those parts next spring . "
630361	630394	630396	630400	Sir T. M. B. Muzzlehem	1173	" I will undertake to get one of the members of the government to introduce a favourable mention of the project into his speech to - morrow night , in the House , "
630402	630418	630396	630400	Sir T. M. B. Muzzlehem	1173	" but you must send him a hundred shares the first thing in the morning . "
630419	630425	630427	630428	Mr. Twitchem	1494	" That shall be done , "
630430	630438	630427	630428	Mr. Twitchem	1494	" Well , my lord and gentlemen , "
630443	630570	630440	630441	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I think that this little business looks uncommonly well . The project is no doubt feasible — I mean , the shares are certain to go off well . Mr. Bubble and Mr. Chouse will undertake to raise them in public estimation , by the reports they will circulate in Capel Court . Of course , my lord and gentlemen , when they are at a good premium , we shall all sell ; and if we do not realise twenty or thirty thousand pounds each — each , mark me — then shall you be at liberty to say that the free and independent electors of Rottenborough have chosen as their representative a dolt and an idiot in the person of your humble servant . "
630571	630583	630585	630586	Mr. Bubble	1493	" Whatever Mr. Greenwood undertakes is certain to turn to gold , "
630588	630594	630596	630597	Mr. Chouse	1314	" Ca n't be otherwise , "
630599	630611	630596	630597	Mr. Chouse	1314	" Mr. Greenwood 's name stands so well in the City , "
630617	630632	630634	630636	Mr. Alderman Sniff	1315	" And his lordship 's countenance to the enterprise is a tower of strength , "
630638	630649	630651	630652	Mr. Tomlinson	1005	" I have already had many inquiries concerning the project , "
630654	630676	630678	630678	Bubble	1493	" Yes — Chouse and I took care to circulate reports in the City that such a scheme was in contemplation , "
630680	630696	630698	630701	Mr. Twitchem:—"the predatory tribes	1503	" Gentlemen , I think that all difficulties have been provided against in this Prospectus , "
630699	630714	630723	630724	Mr. Greenwood	903	Twitchem:—"the predatory tribes , Abd - el - Kadir , and the wild beasts . "
630715	630721	630723	630724	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Nothing could be better , "
630726	630786	630788	630789	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Take care that the Prospectus be sent as an advertisement to every London journal , and the leading provincial ones . You know that I am a shareholder in one of the London newspapers ; and I can promise you that it will not fail to cry up our enterprise . In fact , my lord and gentlemen , "
630791	630821	630788	630789	Mr. Greenwood	903	" I have at this moment in my pocket a copy of a leading article — that will appear in that paper , the day after to - morrow . "
630822	630830	630832	630834	Sir Cherry Bounce	1051	" My gwathioth!—do read it , Greenwood , "
630836	630851	630853	630854	Major Dapper	1492	" Yes : I 'd give the world to hear it — smite me ! "
630879	631163	630856	630857	Mr. Greenwood	903	" In our opposition to those multifarious railway projects which are starting up on all sides , as if some Cadmus had been sowing bubbles in our financial soil , we have only been swayed by our fears lest such a number of schemes , which never can obtain the sanction of Parliament , should injure the credit , and impair the monetary prosperity of the country . It must not , however , be supposed that we are inimical to those undertakings which are based upon fair , intelligible , and reasonable grounds . There are many talented , honourable , and wealthy individuals engaged in speculations of this nature ; and , their motives being beyond suspicion , no one of common sense can for a moment suppose that we include their projects amongst the airy nothings against which we are compelled to put the public on their guard . The extension of railways is internally connected with the progress of civilisation ; and when we behold the principle applied to distant and semi - barbarian countries — as in the case , for instance , of that truly grand and promising enterprise , the Algiers , Oran , and Morocco Great Desert Railway — we feel proud that England should have the honour of taking the initiative in thus propagating beyond its own limits the elements of civilisation , and the germs of humanising influences . At the same time we shall continue our strenuous opposition to all railway schemes which we consider to be mere bubbles blown from the pipes of intriguants and adventurers ; and we shall never pause until in those pipes we put an effectual stopper . "
631164	631175	631177	631178	Sir Cherry	1051	" Thuper - ekthellent — glowiouth — majethtic — athtounding ! "
631184	631197	631199	631200	Mr. Greenwood	903	" You perceive how beautifully — how delicately the puff is insinuated , "
631202	631211	631199	631200	Mr. Greenwood	903	" That article will have an astonishing effect . "
631212	631218	631220	631221	the Marquis	17209	" No doubt of it , "
631223	631280	631220	631221	the Marquis	17209	" You might have contrived to introduce something relative to the Emperor of Morocco 's ladies . Why not state that the Moorish terminus will command a view of the gardens of the imperial harem , where those divine creatures — each of seventeen stone weight — are wo nt to ramble in a voluptuous undress ? "
631281	631294	631296	631296	Greenwood	903	" No — no , my lord ; that would never do ! "
631302	631414	631296	631296	Greenwood	903	" And now , my lord and gentlemen , we perfectly understand each other . Each takes as many shares as he pleases . When they reach a high premium , each may sell as he thinks fit . Then , when we have realized our profits , we will inform the shareholders that insuperable difficulties prevent the carrying out of the project,—that Abd - el - Kadir , for instance , has violated his agreement and declared against the scheme,—that the Committee of Direction will therefore retain a sum sufficient to defray the expenses already incurred , and that the remaining capital paid up shall be returned to the shareholders . "
631415	631428	631430	631431	Mr. Twitchem	1494	" That is exactly what , I believe , we all understand , "
631433	631438	631440	631441	Lord Holmesford	1504	" For my part , "
631443	631468	631440	631441	Lord Holmesford	1504	" I only embark in the enterprise to oblige my friend Greenwood ; and therefore I am agreeable to any thing that he proposes . "
631507	631513	631515	631516	this nobleman	4289	" Now , friend Greenwood , "
631518	631527	631515	631516	this nobleman	4289	" you will keep your engagement with me ? "
631528	631541	631515	631516	this nobleman	4289	" Yes , my lord : I am prepared to accompany you . "
631542	631551	631553	631554	the Marquis	17209	" Let us depart at once , then , "
631561	631584	631553	631554	the Marquis	17209	" my carriage has been waiting some time ; and I long to introduce you to the voluptuous mysteries of Holmesford House . "
631744	631760	631761	631762	The domestic	2464	" You may retire ; and let them ring the bell when all is ready . "
631789	631810	631786	631786	he	17209	" We must endeavour to while away half an hour ; and then I can promise you a pleasing entertainment . "
631833	631838	631840	631841	the Marquis	17209	" For my part , "
631843	631964	631840	631841	the Marquis	17209	" I study how to enjoy life . I possess an immense fortune , and do not scruple to spend it upon all the pleasures I can fancy , or which suggest themselves to me . I am not such an idiot as to imagine that I possess the vigour or natural warmth which characterised my youth ; and therefore I have become an Epicurean in my recreations . I invent and devise the means of inflaming my passions ; and then — then I am young once more . You will presently behold something truly oriental in the refinements on voluptuousness which I have conceived to produce an artificial effect on the temperament when nature is languid and weak . "
631977	632017	631965	631966	Your lordship	28358	" observed Greenwood , who , unprincipled as he was , could not , however , avoid a feeling of disgust when he heard that old voluptuary , with one foot in the grave , thus shamelessly express himself . "
632026	632031	632020	632020	women	1934	" continued the Marquis , "
632070	632071	632072	632072	Your	17209	" "
632089	632093	632081	632087	the grim monster who spares no one	17242	" said Greenwood . "
632161	632192	632154	632154	I	0	" Just as the aged voluptuary uttered these words , a silver bell that hung in the apartment was agitated gently by a wire which communicated with the adjoining saloon . "
632199	632204	632206	632206	me	0	" exclaimed the Marquis : "
632208	632254	632206	632206	me	0	" The nobleman opened the door leading into the saloon , which he entered , accompanied by Greenwood . He then closed the door behind him . The saloon was involved in total obscurity ; the blackest darkness reigned there , unbroken by a ray . "
632260	633150	632257	632257	your	0	" said the Marquis . Greenwood complied ; and the nobleman led him to a sofa at a short distance from the door by which they had entered . They both seated themselves on the voluptuous cushions . For some moments a solemn silence prevailed . At length that almost painful stillness was broken by the soft notes of a delicious melody , which , coming from the farther end of the apartment , stole , with a species of enchanting influence , upon the ear . Gentle and low was that sweet music when it began ; but by degrees it grew louder — though still soft and ravishing in the extreme . Then a chorus of charming female voices suddenly burst forth ; and the union of that vocal and instrumental perfection produced an effect thrilling — intoxicating — joyous , beyond description . The melody created in the mind of Greenwood an anxious desire to behold those unseen choristers whose voices were so harmonious , so delightful . The dulcet , metallic sounds agitated the senses with feelings of pleasure , and made the heart beat with vague hopes and expectations . For nearly twenty minutes did that delicious concert last . Love was the subject of the song,—Love , not considered as an infant boy , nor as a merciless tyrant,—but Love depicted as the personification of every thing voluptuous , blissful , and enchanting,—Love , the representative of all the joys which earth in reality possesses , or which the warmest imagination could possibly conceive,—Love apart from the refinements of sentiment , and contemplated only as the paradise of sensualities . And never did sweeter voices warble the fervid language of passion through the medium of a more enchanting poesy ! Twenty minutes , we said , passed with wonderful rapidity while that inspiring concert lasted . But even then the melody did not cease suddenly . It gradually grew fainter and fainter — dying away , as it were , in expiring sounds of silver harmony , as if yielding to the voluptuous enhancement of its own magic influence . And now , just as the last murmur floated to the ears of the raptured listeners , a bell tinkled at a distance ; and in an instant — as if by magic — the spacious saloon was lighted up with a brilliancy which produced a sensation like an electric shock . At the same time , the music struck up in thrilling sounds once more ; and a bevy of lovely creatures , whom the glare suddenly revealed upon a stage at the farther end of the apartment , became all life and activity in a voluptuous dance . Three chandeliers of transparent crystal had suddenly vomited forth jets of flame ; and round the walls the illumination had sprung into existence , with simultaneous suddenness , from innumerable silver sconces . A glance around showed Greenwood that he was in a vast and lofty apartment , furnished with luxurious ottomans in the oriental style ; and with tables groaning beneath immense vases filled with the choicest flowers . The walls were covered with magnificent pictures , representing the most voluptuous scenes of the heathen mythology and of ancient history . The figures in those paintings were as large as life ; and no prudery had restrained the artist 's pencil in the delineation of the luxuriant subjects which he had chosen . There was Lucretia , struggling — vainly struggling with the ardent Tarquin,—her drapery torn by his rude hands away from her lovely form , which the brutal violence of his mad passion had rendered weak , supple , and yielding . There was Helen , reclining in more than semi - nudity on the couch to which her languishing and wanton looks invited the enamoured Phrygian youth , who was hastily laying aside his armour after a combat with the Greeks . There was Messalina — that imperial harlot , whose passions were so insatiable and whose crimes were so enormous,—issuing from a bath to join her lover , who impatiently awaited her beneath a canopy in a recess , and which was surmounted by the Roman diadem . Then there were pictures representing the various amours of Jupiter,—Leda , Latona , Semele , and Europa — the mistresses of the god — all drawn in the most exciting attitudes , and endowed with the most luscious beauties . But if those creations of art were sufficient to inflame the passions of even that age when the blood seems frozen in the veins , how powerful must have been the effect produced by those living , breathing , moving houris who were now engaged in a rapid and exciting dance to the most ravishing music . They wore six in number , and all dressed alike , in a drapery so light and gauzy that it was all but transparent , and so scanty that it afforded no scope for the sweet romancing of fancy , and left but little need for guesses . But if their attire were thus uniform , their style of beauty was altogether different . We must , however , permit the Marquis to describe them to Greenwood — which he did in whispers . "
633158	633162	632206	632206	me	0	" he said , "
633339	633340	633333	633333	she	17250	" "
633353	633359	633333	633333	she	17250	" observed Greenwood , laughing . "
633366	633379	633333	633333	she	17250	" returned the Marquis , chuckling and coughing at the same time . "
633457	633458	633459	633459	She	17250	" "
633464	633468	633459	633459	She	17250	" exclaimed Greenwood . "
633476	633477	633459	633459	She	17250	" "
633536	633537	633527	633527	she	17250	" "
633546	633550	633538	633538	She	17250	" whispered Greenwood . "
633565	633570	633559	633559	her	17250	" answered the Marquis . "
633718	633719	633696	633696	she	1516	" "
633725	633729	633720	633720	She	1516	" said Greenwood . "
633739	633740	633732	633732	she	1516	" "
633762	633767	633744	633744	she	1516	" returned the Marquis . "
633881	633882	633883	633885	A real Georgian	17277	" "
633887	633891	633892	633894	A real Georgian	17277	" exclaimed Greenwood . "
633896	633901	633892	633894	A real Georgian	17277	" answered the Marquis ; "
634084	634085	634072	634072	her	1516	" "
634094	634098	634099	634099	Malkhatoun	1517	" asked Greenwood . "
634101	634106	634099	634099	Malkhatoun	1517	" replied the Marquis ; "
634130	634131	634118	634121	the wife of Osman	17280	" "
634142	634155	634135	634135	you	17283	" inquired Greenwood , enraptured with the beauty of the oriental girl . "
634163	634170	634159	634159	I	0	" answered the Marquis of Holmesford ; "
634271	634272	634275	634275	she	1516	" "
634281	634286	634275	634275	she	1516	" said Greenwood interrogatively . "
634292	634297	634289	634289	your	17291	" answered the Marquis . "
634339	634552	634332	634332	you	17291	" During this conversion , the dance proceeded . Nothing could be more voluptuous than that spectacle of six charming creatures , representing the loveliness of as many different countries , engaged in a pas de six in which each studied how to set off the graces of her form to the utmost advantage . The genial warmth of the apartment — the delicious perfume of the flowers — the brilliancy of the light — the exciting nature of the pictures — and the enchantment of that dance in which six beings of the rarest beauty were engaged,—filled the mind of Greenwood with an ecstatic delirium . Not the rich and luscious loveliness of Diana Arlington , whom circumstances had made his own,—not the matured and exuberant charms of Eliza Sydney , who had escaped his snares,—not the bewitching beauty of Ellen Monroe , from whose brow he had plucked the diadem of purity,—nor the licentious fascinations of Lady Cecilia Harborough , who sold herself to him for his gold,—not all these had so stirred his heart , so inflamed his ardent imagination , as the spectacle which he now beheld . At length the dance terminated . The Marquis then advanced towards the stage , accompanied by Greenwood , and said , "
634588	634633	634634	634634	I	0	" Greenwood bowed ; the six beauties returned his salutation ; and the Marquis then proposed to adjourn to the ante - room , where supper was served up . The ladies descended from the platform by a flight of steps on one side . "
634642	634647	634634	634634	I	0	" said the Marquis . "
634661	634983	634986	634986	you	17297	" Without hesitation Greenwood advanced towards the charming Malkhatoun , who took the arm which he presented to her , with a sweet smile — as if of gratitude for the preference . As Greenwood thus stepped forward to meet her , he now for the first time observed the orchestra , which was situated in a large recess on the right of the stage , and had consequently been unseen by him from the place which he had originally occupied at the other end of the saloon . The party now proceeded to the ante - room before mentioned . There a magnificent repast was served up . They all seated themselves at table , Kathleen next to the Marquis , and Malkhatoun by the side of Greenwood . At first the conversation languished somewhat , the ladies being abashed and reserved in the presence of a stranger ; but as they grew warmed by degrees with the generous wine , their tongues were unlocked ; and in half an hour they rattled and chatted away as if they had never known restraint . They laughed and displayed their beautiful teeth : their eyes flashed fire , or became voluptuously melting : and their cheeks were animated with the hues of the rose . Even the fair Mohammedan did not refuse the sparkling champagne which effervesced so deliciously over the brim of the crystal glass . The Scotch and Irish girls warbled the sweetest snatches of song which Greenwood had ever heard ; and then the French damsel rose and gave admirable imitations of Taglioni 's , Ellsler 's , and Duvernay 's respective styles of dancing — throwing , however , into her movements and attitudes a wantonness which even the most exciting efforts of those artistes never displayed . It was now nearly two in the morning ; and Greenwood intimated to the Marquis his wish to retire . "
634989	635014	634986	634986	you	17297	" replied the old voluptuary , who had drawn Kathleen upon his knee , and was toying with her as if they were unobserved : "
635035	635043	635079	635079	I	0	" he added , in a whisper , "
635052	635053	635079	635079	I	0	" "
635060	635077	635079	635079	I	0	" asked Greenwood , also in a low tone , while joy flashed from his eyes . "
635082	635087	635079	635079	I	0	" replied the Marquis . "
635101	635149	635092	635092	I	0	" Greenwood smiled , and then redoubled his attentions towards the charming Georgian , who returned his smiles , and seemed to consider herself honoured by his caresses . On a signal from the Marquis , the Scotch , English , French , and Spanish girls withdrew . "
635165	635188	635092	635092	I	0	" cried the nobleman , who was already heated with frequent potations , and inflamed by the contiguity of his Hibernian mistress . "
635192	635234	635092	635092	I	0	" responded Greenwood . The toast was drunk ; and then the Marquis whispered something to Greenwood , pointing at the same time to the door which opened into the bathing rooms . The member of Parliament nodded an enraptured assent . "
635249	635254	635089	635089	you	17297	" observed the nobleman . "
635354	635564	635343	635344	no soul	17309	" Greenwood presented his hand to Malkhatoun , and led her away in obedience to the nobleman 's suggestion . The door by which they left the ante - room admitted them into a passage dimly lighted with a single lamp , and where several doors opened into the bathing apartments . Into one of those rooms Greenwood and the beautiful Georgian passed . Shortly afterwards the Marquis and Kathleen entered another . Here we must pause : we dare not penetrate farther into the mysteries of Holmesford House . Our narrative must now take a leap of several months . It was the middle of October . Once more in the vicinity of Count Alteroni 's mansion near Richmond , a handsome young man and a beautiful dark - eyed maiden were walking together . Need we say that they were Richard and the charming Isabella ? The countenances of both wore an expression of melancholy ; but that indication of feeling was commingled with the traces of other emotions . Richard 's eyes beamed with ardour , and his lips denoted stern resolution : Isabella 's bewitching features showed that her generous soul entertained warm and profound hope , even though the cloud sate upon her brow . "
635571	635580	635343	635344	no soul	17309	" said Richard , gazing tenderly upon her , "
635631	635632	635616	635616	I	0	" "
635656	635661	635649	635649	I	0	" answered the Princess ; "
635726	635727	635728	635728	I	0	" "
635751	635768	635728	635728	I	0	" said Richard , gazing with mingled admiration and rapture upon the angelic countenance of Isabella ; "
635810	635811	635797	635797	you	17310	" "
635829	635833	635824	635824	I	0	" replied Isabella . "
635845	635855	635841	635841	me;—and	17314	" she added , tears starting into her eyes . "
636044	636059	636034	636035	General Grachia	1187	" continued Richard , his handsome countenance now lighted up with a glow of heroic enthusiasm,—"if
636116	636117	636120	636120	I	0	" "
636126	636142	636120	636120	I	0	" exclaimed the Italian lady , whose soul caught the enthusiasm which animated her lover . "
636210	636211	636196	636197	General Grachia	1187	" "
636217	636225	636213	636214	the Prince	6244	" added Richard , with a sigh . "
636267	636268	636238	636238	Isabella	1066	" "
636277	636281	636275	636275	Richard	874	" answered Isabella . "
636343	636344	636355	636355	her	1264	" "
636363	636367	636345	636345	I	0	" returned Markham ; "
636423	636424	636416	636416	thou	17338	" "
636446	636464	636465	636465	I	0	" cried Isabella , now giving way to her grief as the moment of separation drew nigh . "
636518	636519	636520	636520	I	0	" "
636529	636539	636520	636520	I	0	" ejaculated Markham , pressing her to his breast . "
636666	636667	636660	636660	Isabella	1066	" "
636683	636732	636670	636670	Richard	874	" murmured Isabella , as she wept bitterly upon his breast . Then they embraced each other with that passionate ardour — with that lingering unwillingness to separate — with that profound dread to tear themselves asunder , which lovers in the moment of parting alone can know . "
636740	636744	636738	636738	Isabella	1066	" said Richard : "
636760	636761	636738	636738	Isabella	1066	" "
636773	636777	636738	636738	Isabella	1066	" answered Isabella ; "
636784	636957	636958	636959	Master Richard	874	" Another embrace — and they parted . Yes — they parted,—that handsome young man and that charming Italian maiden ! And soon they waved their handkerchiefs for the last time;—then , in a few moments , they were lost to each other 's view . Richard returned home to his house at Lower Holloway . He had visited the farm near Hounslow a few days previously , and had taken leave of Katherine . The young maiden had wept when her benefactor communicated to her his intended absence from England for some time ; but , as he did not acquaint her with the nature of the business which took him way from his native country , she was not aware of the perils he was about to encounter . He had now to say farewell to the inmates of his own dwelling . But towards Mr. Monroe , Ellen , and the faithful Whittingham he was less reserved than he had been to Katherine . Vainly had the old butler implored "
636968	637034	636958	636959	Master Richard	874	business;"—vainly had Mr. Monroe endeavoured to persuade him to refrain from risking his life in the political dissensions of a foreign country ; vainly had the beautiful and generous - hearted Ellen , with a sisterly warmth , argued on the same side . Richard was determined:—they deemed him obstinate — foolish — almost mad ; but they knew not of his love for Isabella ! "
637049	637058	637035	637035	I	0	" said our hero , addressing Mr. Monroe , "
637173	637179	637196	637196	you	17344	" added Richard,—and here his voice faltered,—"my
637217	637218	637219	637219	Richard	874	" "
637226	637262	637219	637219	Richard	874	" exclaimed Mr. Monroe , tears of gratitude trickling down his cheeks . Whittingham also wept ; and Ellen 's sobs were convulsive — for she regarded Richard in the light of a dear brother . "
637279	637283	637219	637219	Richard	874	" said Markham . "
637417	637431	637432	637432	him	2172	" continued Richard , while the tears rolled down his cheeks , large and fast,—"tell
637497	637555	637559	637559	Richard	874	" Ellen sobbed as if her heart would break as Richard uttered these words . There was something fearfully poignant and convulsive in that young lady 's grief . But suddenly rousing herself , she rushed from the room ; and , returning in a few moments with her child , she presented it to Markham , saying "
637573	637618	637622	637622	Richard	874	" Our hero received the innocent infant in his arms , and kissed it tenderly . No pen can depict the expression of pleasure — of radiant joy,—joy shining out from amidst her tears,—with which Ellen contemplated that proof of affection towards her babe . "
637630	637658	637625	637625	you	874	" she exclaimed , as she received back her child . The old butler and Mr. Monroe were not callous to the touching nature of that scene . "
637667	637671	637659	637659	I	0	" observed Richard . "
637713	637739	637740	637740	Morcar	1364	" Markham then withdrew to his study . There he wrote a few letters upon matters of business . At length Whittingham made his appearance . "
637747	637753	637744	637745	Master Richard	874	" said the old man , "
637761	637762	637763	637763	I	0	" "
637771	637811	637769	637769	Whittingham	881	" answered Richard . The old butler withdrew . Then Richard took from his strong - box the mysterious packet which had been left to him by Thomas Armstrong ; and that sacred trust he secured about his person . "
637814	637818	637819	637819	I	0	" he said , "
637830	637838	637819	637819	I	0	" And tears trickled down his cheeks . "
637843	637851	637819	637819	I	0	" he exclaimed , after a pause : "
637872	637940	637944	637944	sir	26649	" He then returned to the drawing - room . At that moment the post - chaise arrived at the front door of the mansion . We will not detail the affecting nature of the farewell scene : suffice it to say that Richard departed with the fervent prayers and the sincerest wishes of those whom he left behind . Morcar , the gipsy , accompanied him . "
637946	637951	637944	637944	sir	26649	" asked the postillion . "
637956	638002	637944	637944	sir	26649	" replied Richard . And the post - chaise whirled him away from the home of his forefathers ! By a special messenger , on the same day when the above - mentioned incidents took place , the following letter was despatched from London : — "
638013	638191	638196	638197	noble lady	17369	" I have the honour to inform your Serene Highness that the measures which I adopted ( and which your Highness condemned in the last letter your Highness deigned to address to me ) have enabled me to ascertain the intentions of the conspirators . The three vessels purchased by them are now completely equipped and manned . One has already arrived in the Downs , where the Chiefs of the rebels are to join her . A second sailed from Hull four days ago : and the third left Waterford about the same time . They will all three meet at Cadiz , where they are to take in stores and water . Twelve hundred exiled Castelcicalans are on board these three ships , which are ostensibly fitted out as emigrant vessels for North America . So well have General Grachia , Colonel Morosino , and Mr. Markham planned their schemes , that I question whether even the English government is acquainted with the real destination of those ships , and the object of their crews . "
638324	638379	638399	638400	your Highness	36939	" At the meeting of which I have just spoken , it was resolved that the descent upon Castelcicala shall be made in the neighbourhood of Ossore , which , I need scarcely inform your Serene Highness , is a small sea - port about thirty - five miles to the south of Montoni . "
638442	638488	638489	638489	I	0	" But remember , my lady — remember the prayer which I offered up to your Highness when first I wrote concerning this conspiracy,—remember the earnest supplication which I then made and now renew,—that not a hair of Richard Markham 's head must be injured ! "
638506	638547	638496	638504	your Serene Highness 's most faithful and devoted servant	17378	" FILIPPO DORSENNI . Oct. 16th , 1840 . Thus was it that Mr. Greenwood 's Italian valet provided , to the utmost of his power , for the safety of Richard Markham , in case those whom he improperly denominated "
638549	639357	638496	638504	your Serene Highness 's most faithful and devoted servant	17378	" should fall into the hands of the Castelcicalan authorities . The Grand - Duchy of Castelcicala is bounded on the north by the Roman States , on the south by the kingdom of Naples , on the east by the Apennine Mountains , and on the west by the Mediterranean Sea . It is the most beautiful , the best cultivated , and the finest portion of the Italian Peninsula . The inhabitants are brave , enlightened , and industrious . Castelcicala is divided into seven districts , or provinces , the capitals of which are Montoni ( which is also the metropolis of the Grand Duchy ) , Abrantani , Veronezzi , Pinalla , Estella , Terano , and Montecuculi . Each province is governed by a Captain - General ( the chief military authority ) , and a Political Prefect , ( the chief civil authority ) . The principal city , Montoni , stands at the mouth of the Ferretti , and contains a hundred thousand inhabitants . It is built on both sides of the river , has a fine harbour , spacious dockyards , and extensive arsenals , and is one of the principal trading - ports of Italy . It is strongly fortified on the system of Vauban . The entire population of the Grand - Duchy of Castelcicala is two millions . Its revenues are three millions sterling ; and the annual income of the sovereign is two hundred thousand pounds . From these details the reader will perceive that Castelcicala is by no means an unimportant country in the map of Europe . We shall now continue our narrative . It was the middle of November , 1840 , and at an early hour in the morning , before sunrise , when three vessels ( two large brigs and a schooner ) ran in as close as the depth of water would permit them with safety , on the Castelcicalan coast a few miles below Ossore . The boats of these vessels were immediately lowered ; and by the time the sun dawned on the scene , nearly twelve hundred armed men were landed without molestation . This force was divided into two columns : one of seven hundred strong was commanded by General Grachia ; the other of five hundred was led by Colonel Morosino . Richard Markham , as Secretary - General of the Constitutional Chiefs , and attended by Morcar , accompanied General Grachia . The chiefs and their staff were all provided with horses . The army presented a somewhat motley aspect , the officers alone appearing in uniforms . The entire force was , however , well provided with weapons ; and every heart beat high with hope and patriotism . The banners were unfurled ; an excellent brass band struck up an enlivening national air ; and the two columns marched in the direction of Ossore . It was deemed most important to possess this sea - port without delay ; as its harbour would afford a safe refuge for the three ships to which the Constitutionalists ( as the invaders termed themselves ) could alone look for the means of retreat , in case of the failure of their enterprise . But of such a result they entertained not the slightest apprehension . And now the peasants in the farm - houses and hamlets near which they passed , were suddenly alarmed by the sounds of martial music : but the rumour of the real object of the invaders spread like wild - fire ; and they had not marched three or four miles , before they were already joined by nearly a hundred volunteer - recruits . The hearts of the Constitutionalists were enlivened by this success ; for while the male inhabitants of the district through which they passed hastened to join them , the women put up audible prayers to heaven to prosper their glorious enterprise . Ossore was in the province of Abrantani , which had for nearly a year groaned under the tyranny of the Captain - General , who governed his district by martial law , the jurisdiction of the civil tribunals having been superseded by the odious despotism of military courts . The Constitutionalists , therefore , entertained the strongest hopes that Ossore would pronounce in their favour the moment they appeared beneath its walls . The Constitutionalists were now only three miles from Ossore , which was hidden from their view by a high hill , up the acclivity of which the two columns were marching , when the quick ear of General Grachia suddenly caught the sound of horses ' feet on the opposite side of the eminence . Turning to one of his aides - de - camp , he said , "
639391	639449	639450	639450	Markham	874	" These words were delivered in a rapid but firm tone . The aide - de - camp galloped away to execute the order ; and General Grachia proceeded to address a few brief but impressive words to the patriots of his division , telling them that the moment to strike a blow was now at hand . "
639452	639464	639450	639450	Markham	874	" said the General , when he had concluded his harangue , "
639475	639513	639516	639519	Count Santa - Croce	1525	" Scarcely were these words uttered , when a large body of cavalry made its appearance on the summit of the hill . A general officer , surrounded by a brilliant staff , was at their head . "
639528	639536	639543	639543	he	1525	" exclaimed Grachia , drawing his sword . "
639561	639857	639551	639551	My	0	" The Constitutionalists gave a deafening cheer in answer to the words of their commander . Then , like an avalanche bursting from its rest on the Alpine height , and rolling with dread and deafening din in its precipitate path , the ducal cavalry thundered down the hill . But they were well received ; and a terrific contest ensued . The ear was deafened with the report of musketry and the clang of weapons . Bullets whistled through the air ; and as the serried ranks on either side poured forth volumes of smoke,—the Constitutionalists with their muskets , and the cavalry with their carbines,—the shouts of the combatants and the groans of the dying announced the desperate nature of the conflict . But , alas ! the Constitutionalists were doomed to experience a sad blow ! General Grachia,—a patriot whose memory demands our admiration and respect,—was slain at the commencement of the battle . He died , fighting gallantly at the head of his troops ; and not before the enemy had felt the weight of his valiant arm . Almost at the same moment the ensign who bore the Constitutional banner was struck to the earth ; and an officer of the ducal cavalry seized the standard . But scarcely had he grasped it , when Richard Markham , who had vainly endeavoured to protect his chief and friend from the weapons of the enemy , spurred his steed with irresistible fury against the officer , hurled him from his seat , and snatched the banner from his grasp . Then , waving the flag above his head with his left hand , and wielding his sword in the right , Richard plunged into the thickest of the fight , exclaiming , "
639866	639905	639551	639551	My	0	" The moment that Grachia fell , a sudden panic seized upon the Constitutionalists of his division ; and they were already retreating , when that gallant exploit on the part of Markham rallied them with galvanic effect . "
639914	640081	639551	639551	My	0	" was the cry ; and our hero was instantly backed by his faithful Morcar and a whole host of Constitutionalists . The conflict was desperate — both sides fighting as if all idea of quarter were out of the question , and victory or death were the only alternatives . Fired by the loss of General Grachia,—conscious of the desperate position in which defeat would place the invaders,—and inspired by the image of Isabella , Richard fought with the fury of the Destroying Angel . He who had only been looked upon as possessing an able head in administrative matters , now suddenly appeared in a new light,—a gallant warrior , who by his bravery had succeeded in rallying a panic - struck army . Already were the ducal cavalry retreating;—already had the Captain - General , who surveyed the conflict from the summit of the hill , disappeared with his staff - officers on the opposite side;—already were the Constitutionalists of Richard 's division shouting "
640082	640420	640539	640546	one of the chiefs of this monstrous invasion	17393	Victory,"—when Colonel Morosino 's corps , which had been engaged by another body of cavalry , was observed to be in full retreat — dispersing in disorder — flying before its triumphant foes . The rumour that Colonel Morosino himself was slain , and that a strong body of infantry , provided with cannon , was already advancing from the opposite side of the hill , now spread like wild - fire through the ranks of Richard 's division . Vainly did Markham endeavour by his example to inspire the troops with courage . A panic seized upon them : they exclaimed that some villain had betrayed them ; and the disorder became general . The ducal cavalry which were so lately in full retreat , rallied again : their charge was irresistible ; they literally swept the slope of the hill down which they rushed . Backed by a small but gallant band that scorned to retreat , and well seconded by Morcar , Richard fought with a desperation which was truly marvellous in one who had never wielded a hostile brand until that day . But a pistol - bullet disabled his right arm ; and he was taken prisoner , together with Morcar and several others . The Constitutionalists were completely defeated ; five hundred fell upon the field of battle ; the remainder were dispersed or captured . But scarcely three hundred succeeded in saving themselves by flight . And almost at the same moment when this unfortunate expedition was thus overwhelmed with ruin , a Castelcicalan frigate , which had put out from Ossore harbour , shortly after the landing of the Constitutionalists , captured the three vessels which were the last hope of those patriots who had escaped from captivity or carnage . From the summit of the hill , whither he was conducted into the presence of the Captain - General of Abrantani , Richard beheld the three vessels strike their colours to the Castelcicalan man - of - war . "
640428	640434	640539	640546	one of the chiefs of this monstrous invasion	17393	" he said within himself ; "
640445	640515	640539	640546	one of the chiefs of this monstrous invasion	17393	" He was not , however , permitted much time for reflection — either in respect to his own desperate condition , or that of the unfortunate fugitives whose last hope was thus cut off by the seizure of the ships ; for the Captain - General — an old man , with white hair , but a stern and forbidding countenance,—addressed him in a haughty and savage tone . "
640528	640532	640517	640517	you	17391	" he exclaimed ; "
640548	640549	640550	640550	I	0	" "
640556	640562	640550	640550	I	0	" answered Richard , fearlessly . "
640565	640572	640550	640550	I	0	" ejaculated the Captain - General . "
640601	640602	640595	640595	he	17395	" "
640611	640632	640633	640634	An Englishman	17397	" said Markham , returning the proud glance of defiance and scorn which Count Santa - Croce threw upon him . "
640636	640643	640633	640634	An Englishman	17397	" thundered the Captain - General . "
640694	640695	640696	640696	I	0	" "
640706	640722	640696	640696	I	0	" said Markham , his voice faltering not , although his cheek grew somewhat pale : "
640768	640769	640758	640758	I	0	" "
640777	640785	640774	640775	a foreigner	6243	" returned the Captain - General ferociously . "
640790	640828	640758	640758	I	0	" Markham was instantly surrounded by soldiers , and dragged to the foot of a tree at a little distance . An aide - de - camp of the Count was ordered to superintend the sad ceremony . "
640847	640879	640880	640880	I	0	" asked the officer , who was a generous - minded young man , and who , having beheld Richard 's bravery in the conflict , could not help respecting him . "
640892	640897	640882	640882	you	0	" replied our hero ; "
640931	640932	640933	640934	Richard Markham	874	" "
640936	640941	640933	640934	Richard Markham	874	" ejaculated the officer . "
640950	640951	640933	640934	Richard Markham	874	" "
640955	640960	640933	640934	Richard Markham	874	" answered our hero . "
640972	641113	640969	640970	brave Englishman	1529	" cried the officer ; and without uttering another word , he hastened back to the spot where the Captain - General of Abrantani was standing . Were we to say that Richard was now otherwise than a prey to the most profound suspense , we should be exaggerating the moral strength of human nature . We have no wish to make of our hero a demigod : we allow him to be nothing more than mortal after all ! It was , therefore , with no little anxiety that Markham saw the officer approach the Captain - General of Abrantani , and discourse with him for some moments in a low tone . The aide - de - camp appeared to urge some point which he was anxious to carry : Count Santa - Croce shook his head ominously . "
641117	641123	640969	640970	brave Englishman	1529	" murmured Richard to himself : "
641131	641241	641242	641242	You	0	" His eyes were still fixed upon those two men who appeared to be arguing his life or death . At length the Captain - General took a paper from the breast of his profusely - laced blue uniform coat , and cast his eyes over it . Richard watched him with breathless anxiety . This state of suspense did not last long . Count Santa - Croce folded the paper , replaced it where he had taken it from , and then gave a brief command to the officer . The latter hurried back to the spot where Markham was hovering as it were between life and death . "
641248	641260	641242	641242	You	0	" cried the Castelcicalan his countenance expressing the most unfeigned joy . "
641264	641268	641261	641262	Generous friend	17411	" exclaimed Richard : "
641279	641280	641274	641274	you	17411	" "
641287	641296	641274	641274	you	17411	" answered the aide - de - camp . "
641338	641345	641333	641336	the Captain - General	41804	" he added in a whisper , "
641354	641355	641333	641336	the Captain - General	41804	" "
641370	641374	641367	641368	generous Italian	1199	" cried Richard ; "
641395	641396	641397	641398	Mario Bazzano	1532	" "
641419	641424	641397	641398	Mario Bazzano	1532	" was the answer . "
641433	641438	641397	641398	Mario Bazzano	1532	" he continued rapidly : "
641470	641471	641474	641475	Signor Bazzano	1532	" "
641477	641481	641482	641482	You	17411	" said Markham . "
641513	641514	641515	641515	My	0	" "
641545	641554	641538	641543	the Captain - General of Abrantani	17383	" returned the aide - de - camp . "
641572	641649	641562	641565	my lord 's surgeon	17423	" Then once more did the generous - hearted Castelcicalan hasten away ; and in a few minutes he returned , accompanied by the Count 's own medical attendant . Richard 's arm was examined ; and it was discovered that a bullet had passed through the fleshy part between the elbow and the shoulder . The wound was painful , though by no means dangerous ; and the surgeon bandaged it with care and skill . "
641655	641659	641652	641653	Signor Markham	1533	" said Bazzano , "
641741	641742	641743	641743	I	0	" "
641749	641753	641746	641746	my	0	" answered Richard , "
641788	641789	641792	641792	signor	17435	" "
641794	641836	641792	641792	signor	17435	" said Bazzano . The aide - de - camp then ordered his own and another horse ( for Richard 's steed had been sorely wounded in the conflict ) to be brought to the spot where this conversation took place . "
641840	641844	641845	641845	you	0	" said Richard , "
641916	641917	641924	641924	you	0	" "
641927	641931	641932	641932	He	27035	" inquired Bazzano . "
641955	642079	642080	642081	Young man	27227	" And Richard pointed in the direction where the poor gipsy was plunged into a painful and profound reverie at a little distance . For the third time the aide - de - camp,—who was a tall , active , handsome , dark - eyed young man,—hurried away . Count Santa - Croce had mounted his horse and repaired , with his staff , to view more closely the spot where the conflict had taken place , and to issue orders relative to the interment of the killed and the disposal of the prisoners . Mario Bazzano did not therefore dread the eagle glance of his superior , as he hastened to perform another generous deed and confer another favour on Richard Markham . "
642083	642092	642080	642081	Young man	27227	" he said , addressing himself to Morcar , "
642109	642121	642105	642107	My good friend	29199	" he added , speaking to the sentinel who stood near , "
642140	642251	642253	642253	I	0	" The sentinel was satisfied ; and Morcar followed the officer to the spot where Richard and the Castelcicalan soldiers who had charge of him , were standing . A third horse was procured ; and in a few minutes the aide - de - camp , our hero , and Morcar rode rapidly away from the scene of carnage , towards Ossore . It were a vain task to attempt to describe the joy which succeeded Morcar 's grief and apprehension , when he discovered that his own and his master 's lives were beyond danger , and that Mario Bazzano was evidently so well inclined to befriend them . "
642269	642280	642253	642253	I	0	" said the aide - de - camp to Richard , "
642344	642345	642337	642337	I	0	" "
642351	642355	642337	642337	I	0	" exclaimed Richard , "
642389	642390	642391	642395	The chiefs of the enterprise	17457	" "
642402	642406	642391	642395	The chiefs of the enterprise	17457	" answered Mario ; "
642458	643109	643110	643110	We	17461	" The severe terms in which the young aide - de - camp , who was evidently devoted to the Grand Duke 's cause , spoke of the Constitutionalists , pierced like a dagger to the heart of our hero ; but delicacy and gratitude towards one from whom he had received such signal obligations , prevented him from making any comment . In a short time the little party reached Ossore , at which town they proceeded to an hotel , where they obtained refreshments . There , also , plain clothes were procured for Markham , in order that his uniform ( which was different from that of the Castelcicalan officer ) might not create unpleasant notice on his arrival at Montoni . Morcar had no uniform to change . When the repast was terminated , Lieutenant Bazzano ordered a post - chaise and four ; and in a short time the little party was whirling rapidly along the high road to the capital . During the journey Richard and the aide - de - camp rose higher in each other 's esteem , the more they conversed together ; and by the time they reached their destination , a sort of friendship , which circumstances had tended to invest with unusual interest , already existed between them . Bazzano assured our hero that the contemplated invasion of the Constitutionalists had been communicated some time previously to the Captain - General of Abrantani ; but whence that information had emanated the young officer was unable to state . Preparations had , however , been in existence for at least a fortnight to receive the invaders when they set foot on the Castelcicalan territory . These assurances confirmed Richard in the opinion which he had already formed , that treachery had existed somewhere on the side of the patriots . It was nine o'clock at night when the post - chaise entered the capital of Castelcicala . In spite of his unfortunate position,—a prisoner , defeated in his grand aims , and with all his hopes apparently blasted,—Richard could not help feeling a glow of pleasure when he thus found himself in the sovereign city which was the birth place of his well - beloved Isabella . But , oh ! in what a state did he now enter its walls ! Instead of accompanying a victorious army to proclaim Alberto Grand Duke of Castelcicala,—instead of the society of the patriotic Grachia and the heroic Morosino,—instead of hearing the welcome voices of a liberated people echoing around,—the young man was in the custody of a subaltern , and , for aught he knew , on his way to a dungeon ! Then — Grachia , Morosino , and the other chiefs of the enterprise — where were they ? Numbered with the dead — or captives in the hands of a savage conqueror ! Oh ! how were Markham 's fondest hopes blasted ! how were his elysian dreams dissipated by the mocking reality of disaster and defeat ! Now , too , how much farther than ever was he removed from the sole object of his toils,—the only hope of his existence,—the hand of Isabella ! Her father , who had all along discountenanced the projects of the Constitutionalists , but who would naturally have pardoned them had they succeeded , could not for a moment be expected to forgive the survivors of that terrible defeat ! All these gloomy ideas annihilated in a moment the temporary glow of pleasure which our hero had experienced on entering Montoni . The chaise traversed the southern part of the metropolis , crossed the Ferretti by a noble bridge , and entered the most fashionable and imposing quarter of that portion of the city which stands on the northern side of the river . At length it stopped at an hotel . "
643115	643120	643110	643110	We	17461	" said Mario Bazzano . "
643128	643132	643133	643133	I	0	" exclaimed Richard . "
643148	643159	643133	643133	I	0	" returned the aide - de - camp , laughing . "
643169	643200	643161	643161	you	0	" said our hero , surprised at the kind forbearance shown towards him — captured , as he had been , with arms in his hand against the reigning Prince . "
643209	643213	643161	643161	you	0	" replied Bazzano . "
643262	643263	643264	643264	My	0	" "
643277	643331	643332	643332	I	0	" said Markham . They then descended from the vehicle , and were conducted to a private apartment in the hotel . Bazzano ordered refreshments : then , as soon as he himself had drunk a glass of wine and eaten a mouthful of food , he left the room , simply observing , "
643354	643383	643392	643393	the Castelcicalans	1226	" Markham bowed an acquiescence with this request ; and , as soon as the door had closed behind the aide - de - camp , he exclaimed , "
643402	643403	643398	643400	a glorious race	17467	" "
643418	643422	643415	643416	Mr. Markham	874	" observed Morcar . "
643437	643442	643427	643427	I	0	" returned our hero . "
643578	643594	643565	643565	her	17475	" he continued , rather musing to himself , than addressing his words to Morcar ; "
643625	643665	643666	643667	Signor Markham	1533	" Then he paced the room — lost in conjecture , and giving way to the immense variety of reflections which his position was calculated to engender . In an hour the young aide - de - camp returned . "
643669	643673	643666	643667	Signor Markham	1533	" he said , "
643690	643699	643688	643688	You	1533	" he added , addressing himself to Morcar , "
643706	643800	643688	643688	You	1533	" Richard signified his readiness to follow Bazzano ; and they left the hotel together . It was now past eleven o'clock ; and , though the shops were all closed , the streets of Montoni were resplendent with the lustre which streamed from the windows of the cafés , restaurants , and club - houses . Markham could not help observing to his companion that there appeared to be numerous patrols of military moving about in the capital , and that the sentinels were posted along the streets at very short intervals . "
643814	643823	643825	643825	I	0	" answered the aide - de - camp ; "
643864	643865	643851	643851	I	0	" "
643874	643948	643866	643869	The reigning Grand Duke	28612	" observed Markham . Bazzano made no reply : it was evident that he could not contradict the assertion ; and , being in his sovereign 's service , he could not with propriety corroborate it . A quarter of an hour 's rapid walking brought our hero and the young officer to an immense square ; and the magnificent buildings on two sides thereof shed a brilliant light from their ample casements . "
643955	644691	643866	643869	The reigning Grand Duke	28612	" said Mario . Crossing the square , the officer led the way towards a small door in one of the angles of the immense edifice . Mario knocked gently ; and the door was immediately opened by a tall servant in a gorgeous livery . Markham followed his companion into a small vestibule , brilliantly lighted , and at the end of which was a narrow staircase carpetted all over . Not a word was spoken : the domestic bowed as the two young men passed him ; and Bazzano led the way up the staircase , which was lighted by lamps held in the hands of marble statues placed in recesses . On the landing which the visitors speedily reached , an usher , dressed in black , and wearing a massive gold chain , advanced to receive them ; and , opening a door , conducted them into an ante - room , where he requested them to be seated . He then opened another door on the opposite side from which they had entered the room , and disappeared for a few minutes . On his return , he desired Markham to follow him . Our hero obeyed , and was led through several magnificent apartments , all brilliantly lighted , but unoccupied at the moment . At length the usher paused in a room smaller , but more elegantly furnished , than any of the preceding ones ; and , having requested our hero to take a seat , he retired by the same door by which they had entered that room . For a few minutes Richard remained alone with his reflections . He was now in the Castelcicalan palace . But wherefore had he been brought thither ? Was it to undergo an examination before the Grand Duke , relative to the invasion of the morning ? was it to be overwhelmed with reproaches by that sovereign against whom , and without provocation , he had borne arms ? Could treachery be meditated ? No — that idea was absurd . He was so completely in the power of the Grand Duke , that there had been no need to exercise treachery towards him , if punishment were intended . Then our hero thought of the Grand Duchess . Had she learnt that he was engaged in the expedition ? had she remembered his name ? was it through her he had received that treatment from Mario Bazzano which had so astonished him ? could it be possible that she would interest herself in him ? He was in the midst of his reverie , when a door opposite to where he was sitting , suddenly opened ; and a lady , elegantly attired , with a tiara of diamonds upon her brow , entered the apartment . One glance was sufficient for Richard Markham ! He immediately recognised the beautiful woman whom he had seen five years previously , disguised in male attire , at Mrs. Arlington 's lodgings , and whose singular history had subsequently reached his ears when he was imprisoned at the same time as herself , though of course not in the same department , in Newgate . Yes — he recognised her who was once Eliza Sidney ; and he now bent his head to the grand Duchess of Castelcicala . Although somewhat pale , and showing a slightly deeper shade of that melancholy expression which her countenance had acquired during her captivity of two years , Eliza was still eminently lovely . Her form had expanded into those proportions which indicated the maturity of her charms , but which gave to her beauty a voluptuousness that was only attempered by the chaste glances of her melting hazel eyes , and the halo of purity which dwelt on her lofty and spotless brow . And well fitted was that pure and open forehead to be crowned with the glittering tiara which denoted her sovereign rank , and which set off to such exquisite advantage the large bands of her light , luxuriant , shining , chesnut hair ! Her walk was a dignified and yet harmonious motion;—her gesture expressed no particle of hauteur , but still denoted a consciousness of the respect which she felt to be due to her position as a Princess , and to her character as a woman . "
644699	644730	644696	644697	Mr. Markham	874	" she said in a sweet tone , and with a manner full of grace : then , placing herself on a sofa at a short distance , she added , "
644763	644764	644765	644765	I	0	" "
644771	644780	644767	644767	your	17486	" answered Markham , firmly , but respectfully . "
644810	644811	644800	644808	those who have power to command in this State	17490	" "
644821	644832	644818	644819	Mr. Markham	874	" returned the Grand Duchess , with a half smile . "
644973	644974	644975	644975	Your	17484	" "
645002	645006	644975	644975	Your	17484	" said Markham ; "

645156	645189	645152	645153	your Highness	36939	" answered Markham , surprised at this mention of an incident which had occurred only a short time previously to the separation of himself and his brother on the hill - top . "

645213	645226	645210	645211	your Highness	36939	" ejaculated Markham , more and more amazed at what he heard . "
645232	645236	645229	645230	Mr. Markham	874	" continued Eliza : "

645345	645349	645342	645343	your Highness	36939	" observed Richard . "
645352	645362	645342	645342	your	874	" resumed the Grand Duchess , sinking her voice , "
645398	645399	645400	645400	Your	874	" "
645421	645425	645426	645426	I	0	" said Markham . "
645445	645451	645430	645430	I	0	" answered the Grand Duchess ; "
645469	645478	645479	645479	I	0	" she added , with an arch smile , "

645525	645536	645510	645510	Your	874	" said Markham , well knowing to what Eliza alluded . "
645539	645547	645510	645510	Your	874	" exclaimed the Grand Duchess , solemnly : "
645570	645578	645566	645566	his	1444	" she continued , archly smiling again , "
645657	645666	645682	645683	General Grachia	1187	" exclaimed Eliza , wiping away a tear , "
645693	645694	645695	645696	General Grachia	1187	" "
645711	645715	645695	645696	General Grachia	1187	" observed Richard . "
645723	645741	645695	645696	General Grachia	1187	" said the Grand Duchess , after a pause , during which she seemed a prey to deep thought,—"do
645807	645815	645794	645794	You	874	" she added , with a sigh , "
645978	645979	645960	645960	I	0	" "
645994	645999	645990	645992	your Serene Highness	41683	" exclaimed Markham fervently . "

646019	646023	645990	645992	your Serene Highness	41683	" said Eliza . "
646041	646179	646180	646181	Mr. Markham	874	" When Eliza had first entered the room , Richard had bowed his head low to the Grand Duchess ; but now he sank on his bended knee in presence of the humane and tender - hearted woman . Eliza felt the full force of this expression of feeling:—it rewarded her for her goodness ! She extended her hand towards him ; and he respectfully touched it with his lips . Then he rose , and resumed his seat . Oh ! at that moment , how sweet — how sweet to the amiable and noble - minded woman,—noble in nature , as well as in name,—was the possession of power;—and how amply recompensed was she for its humane use , by that spontaneous tribute of respect which she had just received from her fellow - countryman ! "
646183	646191	646180	646181	Mr. Markham	874	" she said , after a pause , "
646296	646297	646274	646274	you	874	" "

646402	646408	646393	646395	your Serene Highness	41683	" was the decided reply . "

646893	646901	646889	646891	foolish young man	17566	" exclaimed the Grand Duchess , smiling . "

647015	647026	647013	647013	they	17569	" asked Eliza , still half smiling as she spoke . "
647056	647057	647060	647060	God	880	" "
647071	647077	647060	647060	God	880	" said the Grand Duchess . "
647095	647186	647187	647187	I	0	" Eliza once more extended her hand towards our hero , who pressed it respectfully , but with fervour , to his lips . He then withdrew . In the adjoining apartment he found the usher waiting for him . They retraced their steps to the ante - room , where Signor Mario Bazzano was seated , expecting their return . In a few minutes our hero and the young aide - de - camp were on their way back to the hotel . During the walk , Bazzano said , "
647209	647216	647189	647189	you	17572	" Markham replied in the affirmative . "
647234	647240	647220	647220	I	0	" observed the young officer . "
647256	647406	647220	647220	I	0	" We must now transport our readers back to London . At about the same time when the events of the two preceding chapters occurred in Castelcicala , others of a scarcely less interesting nature took place in the great metropolis of England . It was about three o'clock in the afternoon of one of those dark , misty , dispiriting November days , when the sun is scarcely visible , and sinks early to rest , that half - a - dozen fashionable gentlemen were lounging in the bay - window of a Club - House in St. James 's Street . They were all dressed in the first style : gold chains festooned over waistcoats of the most recent Parisian fashion ; and brilliantly polished boots , without a speck of mud upon them , showed that their owners had not arrived at the Club on foot .

647416	647423	647414	647414	Greenwood	903	" asked the Marquis of Holmesford . "

647607	647618	647571	647571	he	1538	" ejaculated Mr. Greenwood , horror depicted on his countenance . "

647644	647649	647650	647650	He	1538	" answered Lord Dunstable . "

647751	647778	647725	647725	Dunstable	1539	" observed Colonel Cholmondeley , a gentleman of about three - and - thirty who was one of the group in the Club - House window . "

647885	647923	647863	647863	God	880	" muttered the Marquis of Holmesford , who , in consequence of swollen gums , had been compelled to lay aside his false teeth for a few days , and was therefore somewhat incomprehensible in his speech . "
647965	647966	647944	647944	they	35368	" "
647973	647978	647944	647944	they	35368	" observed Mr. Greenwood . "

648272	648282	648216	648216	you	17613	" observed Major Dapper , who was also present . "
648288	648293	648216	648216	you	17613	" demanded Colonel Cholmondeley . "
648300	648305	648216	648216	you	17613	" said Mr. Smicksmack . "

648517	648528	648474	648474	me	0	" said Lord Dunstable , when the cachinnation was concluded . "
648541	648545	648536	648536	Chichester	1319	" replied Greenwood . "

648872	648879	648856	648856	he	2172	" muttered the Marquis of Holmesford . "

648951	648952	648949	648949	Cleopatra	1543	" "
648962	648966	648949	648949	Cleopatra	1543	" remarked Greenwood . "

649031	649035	649025	649025	she	2373	" answered Greenwood . "
649085	649086	649090	649090	Greenwood	903	" "
649092	649097	649090	649090	Greenwood	903	" cried the Marquis . "

649126	649131	649119	649119	Greenwood	903	" observed Lord Dunstable . "

649151	649156	649119	649119	Greenwood	903	" replied the capitalist . "

649206	649211	649195	649195	you	17209	" remarked Greenwood coolly . "
649224	649300	649218	649218	I	0	" These last words were uttered , in a loud tone , and accompanied by a stern shake of the head , to a poor , ragged , shivering creature , who had paused on the pavement outside to solicit alms from the aristocrats assembled at the window . The miserable woman cast one glance of ineffable anguish on Mr. Greenwood , and then hurried away , overwhelmed by the savage determination of his refusal . "
649313	649318	649218	649218	I	0	" said Mr. Smicksmack . "
649338	649339	649329	649329	her	27373	" "
649345	649358	649343	649343	I	0	" whispered Lord Dunstable to Colonel Cholmondeley , whom he drew aside . "
649366	649377	649360	649360	you	0	" he asked in a low and somewhat hoarse tone . "
649386	649403	649384	649384	I	0	" said the Captain , also sinking his voice — but simply because Dunstable did so . "
649413	649419	649410	649411	Lydia Hutchinson	1544	" returned the young nobleman , "
649437	649449	649431	649432	my God	27430	" And for a few moments his countenance became inexpressibly sad . "
649461	649465	649431	649432	my God	27430	" whispered Cholmondeley . "
649473	649477	649467	649467	she	27373	" said Dunstable . "
649494	649495	649487	649487	her	27373	" "
649523	649530	649516	649516	Lydia	1544	" interrupted the colonel , impatiently . "
649575	649962	649567	649567	I	0	" Then the Captain drew the young nobleman back to the group in the window ; and in a few minutes the sprightly nature of the conversation banished from Dunstable 's mind the unpleasant reminiscences which had been temporarily excited by the sudden appearance of one whom he knew so well ! In the meantime that miserable female pursued her way down St. James 's Street . The weather was cold — dreadfully cold : the streets were damp — and she had neither shoes nor stockings ! An old cotton gown , a wretched rag of a shawl , and a broken straw bonnet , constituted her sole attire . Not an article of clothing had she more than those enumerated . She had parted with her under garments to obtain the means of subsistence ; not even a petticoat had she beneath that thin cotton gown ! When she stopped for a moment to implore alms at the Club - window , it was the first time she had ever begged . She had not recognised him who had recognised her : but the stern countenance of Greenwood , as he refused her a single penny from his immense wealth , had struck her with despair . If the rich would not assist her , how could she hope for succour from the poor ? She hurried down the street , weak and weary as she was;—but she hurried , with a sort of shuffling pace , because she was cold , and her feet were so benumbed that she could not feel that she had any ! She passed many a brilliantly lighted shop,—many a superb Club,—many a magnificent hotel , from the underground windows of which emanated the savoury steam of delicious viands:—she beheld cheerful fires , roaring up the chimneys of the kitchens whence those odours came;—but she was starving , shivering , dying , all the same ! A carriage , with arms emblazoned on the panels , and with horses whose beauty and appointments attracted the gaze of the passengers , was standing opposite to a splendid shawl - warehouse . Just as the poor mendicant was passing , a tall footman , carrying a gold - headed cane in his hand , pushed her rudely back , exclaiming , "
649974	650088	649965	649965	you	17656	" The shivering woman cast a timid look around , and beheld an elderly gentleman handing a lady , much younger than himself , to the carriage above mentioned . The blaze of light from the shop window illuminated that portion of the street ; and as the elegantly - dressed lady turned her countenance towards her companion , to answer some observation which he made to her , the mendicant caught a full view of her beautiful features . A scream escaped from the beggar 's lips : then , in the next moment , she rushed towards the door of the carriage , which the gentleman and lady were just entering . "
650094	650098	650089	650092	Miss Enfield — Adeline	17657	" she exclaimed . "
650108	650122	650123	650124	Miss Enfield	1545	" cried the voice of the nobleman — for such indeed he was . "
650132	650142	650126	650126	I	0	" answered the beggar , clinging to the door . "
650151	650156	650157	650157	I	0	" asked the nobleman . "
650173	650188	650191	650192	a teacher	17662	" faltered the beautiful lady , evidently by no means pleased at the recognition . "
650194	650199	650191	650192	a teacher	17662	" cried the nobleman . "
650211	650324	650191	650192	a teacher	17662	to:"—and he drew up the carriage window violently . That was a signal for the coachman to whip his horses : the fiery animals sprang forward — the carriage moved off with a species of jerk — the poor starving , shivering creature was thrown upon the kerb - stone — and there she lay insensible . In a moment she was surrounded by a crowd , that formed a circle about her , and stood gazing on the prostrate , motionless form as if the spectacle were very interesting , but by no means calculated to awaken compassionate sympathy . Then a huge policeman elbowed his way through the crowd , crying "
650329	650448	650449	650449	She	17663	" in a very savage tone , and crushing divers bonnets , besides upsetting sundry small boys in his endeavours to force a passage . But at the same moment that he reached the spot where the poor creature was lying , a lady , about six - and - twenty years of age , and well though by no means showily dressed , pressed through the crowd , and immediately bestowed her attention on the mendicant female . The lady raised the unfortunate being 's head ; and then , by the light of the lamp , it was discovered that she had received a wound on the temple , from which the blood was flowing freely . "
650465	650470	650473	650474	the workus	27282	" said the policeman ; "
650480	650481	650482	650482	She	17663	" "
650488	650494	650495	650495	I	0	" observed the lady firmly : "
650506	650507	650495	650495	I	0	" "
650517	650522	650511	650511	you	0	" demanded the policeman . "
650538	650543	650528	650528	her	17663	" answered the lady . "
650568	650578	650580	650580	you	17668	" A murmur of approbation arose amongst the crowd . "
650594	650605	650580	650580	you	17668	" continued the lady , addressing herself to the officer . "
650632	650681	650682	650682	She	2916	" The wretched woman was removed to the adjacent establishment of a medical practitioner ; and in a short time the benevolent lady had the satisfaction of ascertaining that the wound on the poor creature 's forehead was the only injury which she had sustained by the fall . "
650695	650707	650708	650708	I	0	" said the surgeon , when he had bandaged the wound . "
650723	650851	650852	650852	You	2916	" This humane proposal was immediately carried into effect;—the starving creature would have eaten ravenously ; but the surgeon prudently checked her;—and in a short time she was considerably revived . She appeared to be about seven or eight and twenty years of age ; and possessed the remains of great personal attractions . But her dark eyes were sunken , and their lustre was dimmed with privation : her cheeks were hollow ; and her form was little more than mere skin and bone . The lady did not ask her if she had any friends , or any home . Such a question would have been a superfluous mockery of one whose appearance was sufficient to convey the sad tale of utter destitution and hopelessness . "
650862	650872	650852	650852	You	2916	" whispered the lady , in a kind tone . "
650895	650896	650883	650883	I	0	" "
650906	650915	650902	650902	you	26758	" began the woman , bursting into tears ; "
650921	650922	650923	650923	I	0	" "
650930	650935	650923	650923	I	0	" interrupted the lady . "
650947	650992	650993	650993	I	0	" The surgeon 's boy was despatched for a hackney - coach , into which the invalid was conveyed . The lady then entered it , and directed the driver to take them to her residence , which was in Cannon Street , City . "
650999	651009	650997	650997	myself	0	" said the lady , as they proceeded thither ; "
651038	651039	651042	651042	madam	26758	" "
651044	651050	651042	651042	madam	26758	" returned the poor woman , "
651086	651173	651176	651177	Mrs. Chichester	1319	" And the unhappy creature wept bitterly . The lady endeavoured to console her to the best of her ability ; and even in the short conversation which passed between them during the ride from the West End to the City , the invalid gave proofs of a superior understanding and cultivated mind . At length they reached Cannon Street , and stopped at a house , the lower portion of which was a stationer 's shop . The lady occupied apartments on the first floor . "
651186	651199	651176	651177	Mrs. Chichester	1319	" exclaimed the mistress of the house , who opened the door . "
651207	651208	651176	651177	Mrs. Chichester	1319	" "
651215	651240	651211	651211	your	26758	" interrupted Viola , with a smile — for the benevolent lady was none other than the neglected and persecuted wife of Mr. Chichester . "
651271	651272	651261	651261	I	0	" "
651286	651368	651369	651369	My	0	" exclaimed the mistress of the house . Then she bustled about to help the invalid up stairs ; and the poor creature speedily experienced a feeling akin to happiness , when cheered by a comfortable fire and a good meal . Mrs. Chichester also supplied her with warm clothes ; and a night 's rest made her an altered being . On the following day she was enabled to narrate her history , which she did in the ensuing manner . "
651550	651766	651541	651542	my mother	27004	" To say that my brother and myself were the only consolation which my poor father now possessed , were merely to tell the common tale of parental love in the widowed breast . We were indeed his only consolation ! Often and often has he told us this , when we were old enough to comprehend his meaning , and appreciate the full value of his kindness . He was an excellent man . In order to let his children be respectably dressed and maintain a decent appearance — especially at church on Sundays — he stinted himself of almost the common necessaries of life . He undertook my brother 's education himself ; and from his lips I also learnt the rudiments of the knowledge which I possess . There was resident in the village , a widow lady of great accomplishments , but reduced circumstances ; and out of his pittance my father even contrived to spare something to procure her services in giving me lessons in music , drawing , embroidery , and French . Under her tuition I progressed rapidly in those branches ; and , when I was sixteen , I was considered to be better educated than if I had been brought up at a boarding - school . "
651947	652052	651926	651926	himself	2156	" My father brought me up to London , and left me at Mrs. Lambkin 's establishment , which was called Belvidere House . He wept when he took leave of me ; but as Mrs. Lambkin ( who was a widow , about forty years of age ) spoke very kindly , and promised to take great care of me , the sorrow of parting was somewhat mitigated on both sides . I was to receive no salary the first year ; but if I suited , my remuneration was fixed at six pounds for the second year , to be increased subsequently . "
652281	652639	652640	652640	I	0	" Scarcely had my father left the door , when Mrs. Lambkin turned round towards me , and in a tone which I considered somewhat inconsistent with her former manner and language , exclaimed , ' Now , miss , dry those tears , and go up to your room to make yourself decent for afternoon school . The young ladies at Belvidere House all belong to the first families of distinction , and are accustomed to see the teachers well dressed . ' Then , ringing the bell , she said to a smart servant who answered the summons , ' Jessica , show Miss Hutchinson to her room . ' Jessica took a good long stare at me , then turning sharply round , told me to follow her . We proceeded up two handsome flights of stairs , beautifully , carpetted . On the second floor , the doors of several bed - rooms stood open ; and I could not help admiring the comfort — nay , even the luxury , which their interior revealed to the hasty glance that I threw into them . ' These are the young ladies ' rooms , ' said Jessica abruptly : ' yours is higher up . ' On the third floor I also observed the doors of several chambers standing open , and permitting glimpses of great neatness inside . ' These are our rooms , ' said Jessica — alluding , as I afterwards discovered , to the servants ' apartments . Up another flight we went ; and now we reached the attics . ' These are the junior teachers ' rooms , ' cried Jessica , ' and this is yours , ' she added , flinging open the door of a garret , wherein I perceived nothing save a mean - looking bed , one chair , a table with a wash - hand basin on it , a brown stone pitcher in a corner , and a glass as large as the palm of my hand hanging to a pin stuck in the wood - work of the window . "
652963	653086	652953	652953	Betsy	902	" Jessica walked away in the most stately manner , preceding me down stairs , and evidently considering me her inferior . Betsy was summoned ; and with no small amount of grumbling , that dirty slattern condescended to hold one end of my trunk , while I carried the other . Scarcely had I dressed myself in my second best gown ( I had but three)—when Jessica came up to say that Mrs. Lambkin was excessively angry at the length of time I took to make myself decent . Jessica herself was in a very bad humour at being obliged to mount four flights to convey this message , and told me in an insolent manner not to dawdle so again . "
653244	653357	653236	653238	forty young ladies	17733	" The four little girls whom I had to teach , were as stupid as they well could be , and so pert that I scarcely knew how to manage them . They laughed and giggled at every attempt which I made to instruct them . Sometimes Mrs. Lambkin would exclaim , ' Hutchinson , there 's too much noise with your class;'—and when I spoke very low to my pupils , it was , ' Hutchinson , you 're literally doing nothing there ! ' The three senior teachers were alone addressed by Mrs. Lambkin as Miss : with the three juniors it was plain Rhodes , Jessop , and Hutchinson . "
653515	653616	653489	653489	I	0	" I soon found that Mrs. Lambkin was very far from being so amiable as she had appeared in the presence of my father — except of an evening , after about six or seven o'clock ; and then she grew more cheerful — nay , jovial , and was very familiar with us all . But she was constantly leaving the room where we all sate , and remaining away for only a few minutes each time ; but the oftener she went out in this strange manner , I noticed that the more good - humoured she grew . "
653881	654162	653872	653872	I	0	" That same night , after I had retired to my garret , the door was opened softly , and the Honourable Miss Enfield entered . She was in her night clothes ; and , placing her finger on her lip to enjoin caution , she said , ' My dear Miss Hutchinson , you can do me such a favour , if you will ? ' ' — Certainly I will , if I can , ' was my answer.—'Oh ! you can very easily , ' continued the young lady , who , by - the - by , was a sweet pretty girl , and very interesting : ' a letter will come addressed to you , by the first post to - morrow morning . '—'Indeed ! ' I said ; ' and how do you know that?'—'Because , though the envelope will be addressed to you , the letter inside will be for me , ' she answered , laughing.—'And what would Mrs. Lambkin say if she knew it ? ' I asked.—'She can not know it unless you tell her ; and I am sure you will not do that , dear Miss Hutchinson , ' returned the Honourable Miss Enfield.—'I will oblige you this time , ' I said , after some consideration ; ' but pray do not let this take place again . '—Then she kissed me so affectionately , I was really pleased to have made a friend of her ; for I was so forlorn and unhappy in my situation — though I never let my father know how completely we had been deceived in Mrs. Lambkin 's disposition . "
654398	654482	654389	654396	the same person as the two preceding ones	17764	" She was very grateful to me for my kindness , and treated me with marked attention . Being the daughter of a noble house , her conduct towards me produced a pleasant effect in respect to the three senior teachers , who , seeing that Miss Enfield courted my society , began to treat me more as their equal than they had hitherto done . Mrs. Lambkin also grew less harsh towards me ; and my position acquired some degree of comfort . "
654917	655157	655158	655161	The Honourable Miss Enfield	1545	" Then the Honourable Miss Enfield withdrew , leaving me greatly astonished at what I had heard . I lay awake the greater part of the night , reflecting on all that she had told me ; and when I thought of this young lady 's rank , youth , beauty , and brilliant prospects , I felt sad at the idea that the purity of her soul had been in the least degree interfered with by tales of drunken men , bad women , and police - riots , as well as by the example of an intemperate school - mistress . Miss Enfield 's communication had shed a new light upon my mind . The term ' bad woman ' set me thinking what it could mean ; and at last I comprehended its signification . Oh ! how I shuddered when that first consciousness of the real extent to which female frailty can reach , grew more and more defined in my imagination , until I understood its deep shade of guilt . The first step towards teaching the youthful mind to become infidel , is to suffer it to know that there live men , in Christian countries , who deny the truth of revealed religion:—the first step towards inducing a young girl to harbour impure thoughts , is to show her that female depravity has , in its worst sense , an indubitable existence ! "
655320	655585	655304	655304	she	1545	" We passed by several linen - drapers ' shops ; but the Honourable Miss Enfield entered none of them . At length we reached Hyde Park . ' Do let us take a walk here , my dear Miss Hutchinson , ' she exclaimed : ' see how beautiful the trees already seem ; and what a freshness there is in the air!'—I assented ; and we entered the Park . Presently Miss Enfield burst out into a joyous laugh . I inquired the reason ; but she only looked archly at me , and renewed her merriment . Scarcely had I time to question her a second time concerning her joyousness , when she pressed my arm significantly ; and I beheld two tall , fine - looking military men approaching . I cast my eyes downwards , for I perceived that they were looking attentively at us ; but in a few moments I heard one of the officers exclaim , ' It is my dearest Adeline ! I felt convinced that she would not disappoint me . '—'Not for worlds , Cholmondeley , ' she replied;—and , in another moment , she had left me and was hanging on the officer 's arm.—'Now , Dunstable , you do the amiable with Miss Hutchinson , ' said Captain Cholmondeley to his companion ; and before I could recover from the stupefaction into which these proceedings threw me , I found myself arm - in - arm with a handsome young officer , whom I soon afterwards ascertained to be Lord Dunstable . "
655827	656067	655822	655825	the Honourable Captain Cholmondeley	1557	" Nearly two hours passed away in this manner ; and then I insisted upon returning to Belvidere House . We accordingly overtook Miss Enfield and the Captain ; and I signified my desire , observing that Mrs Lambkin would be angry did we remain absent much longer . ' We will not part with you , ladies , ' said the Captain , ' unless you promise to lighten our darkness again with your presence ere we are all a week older . '—'This day week we could manage it again , ' immediately observed Miss Enfield.—I murmured an objection.—'If you do not come , my dearest Miss Hutchinson , ' whispered Lord Dunstable to me , ' I shall either hang or drown myself . '—I smiled ; and Adeline , who was watching my countenance , cried , ' Oh ! Lydia is such a dear good - natured creature , and we are such friends , I am sure she will not refuse . '—Again I smiled ; and this was taken for an assent on my part . Then the two gentlemen looked round , and , perceiving no strangers near at the present , they bade us farewell in a most tender manner:—I mean that Captain Cholmondeley pressed Adeline in his arms , while Lord Dunstable literally glued his lips to mine . And I —— Oh ! my resistance was but feeble ! "
656402	656560	656561	656561	Adeline	1545	" I could not sleep all that night ! I considered my fortune already assured ; and I declare most solemnly that I felt more delight , in the visions of prosperity and bliss which I conjured up , on account of my father and brother , than for the sake of myself . The week passed away : I did not oppose Miss Enfield 's intimation to me that we should keep our appointment with the two officers ; and , permission having been obtained as before , we sallied forth . Hyde Park was soon gained ; and we were not kept waiting a moment by our beaux — for they were already at the place of meeting . They received us with evident delight ; and as Lord Dunstable pressed my hand tenderly , my eyes met his — a deep blush suffused my countenance — and I felt that I already loved him . "
656793	656955	656774	656775	Lord Dunstable	1539	" The Honourable Captain Cholmondeley 's private dwelling was in the immediate vicinity of Sloane Street ; and thither we repaired . A servant in livery opened the door : we were conducted into an elegantly furnished dining - room , and a cold collation was speedily served up . Champagne was poured out ; and , not aware of its strength , I drank two glasses without much hesitation . The Captain told the servant to leave the room ; and I remember that we laughed , and chatted , and ate , and drank as happily as if Adeline and myself were in no way tied to time . But presently my senses became obscured ; my head swam round ; and I was ready to fall from my seat . I have a faint idea of beholding Adeline sitting on the Captain 's knee ; and then I recollected no more , until I awoke in the morning ! "
657142	657452	657453	657453	I	0	" Then came the sudden thought , ' What was to become of me in the meantime?'—'You can return to Belvidere House , ' answered Lord Dunstable : ' Miss Enfield will make it all right for you . '—'Return to Belvidere House ! ' I exclaimed : ' impossible!'—'Nay , it is very possible , ' rejoined my lover : ' Adeline , who is an uncommonly sharp girl , arranged it all last evening before she left . She said that she should let herself into Belvidere House by the back way , and that she should proceed straight into the parlour , where she should assure Mrs. Lambkin that you , Lydia , had come home with such a dreadful headach , you were obliged to go straight up to bed . '—'That excuse will do for last night , ' I said , wringing my hands in despair : ' but this morning?'—'All is arranged equally well , ' answered my noble lover . ' It is only now six o'clock : you are to be in the neighbourhood of the school by half - past seven ; Adeline will steal out and join you : then you can both walk boldly up to the door , enter , and say that you have been out together for a little stroll , in accordance with a permission to that effect which Adeline declared she would obtain from Mrs. Lambkin last night , when that respectable lady was in her cups . '—These stratagems produced a great relief to my mind , because I saw that they were entirely practicable . But , even in that moment of my agitated soul , I could not help reflecting upon the deep artifice which lurked in the bosom of so young a creature as the Honourable Miss Enfield . "
657583	657874	657875	657878	The Honourable Miss Enfield	1545	" At a short distance from the school , I met Miss Enfield . I cast down my eyes , and blushed deeply . She laughed merrily . ' Oh ! Adeline , ' I exclaimed , ' to what has all this intriguing brought me?'—'My dear Lydia , ' she returned , ' our positions in that respect are equal ; and , as our lovers will keep their words and marry us , where is the harm?'—I stared at the young lady with the most profound astonishment . How were our positions equal in reference to our lovers ? She speedily cleared up my doubts . ' If you continue to blush and turn pale alternately , twenty times in a minute , as you are now doing , ' she said , ' we shall both be suspected . We must exercise the greatest caution ; for if it were discovered that we surrendered ourselves to our lovers——.'—'We ! ' I repeated , contemplating her with increasing astonishment.—'My dear Lydia , ' she continued , ' do you suppose that I was more virtuous than you , or the captain less tender than the nobleman ? I certainly would not have accepted the invitation to visit Cholmondeley 's private abode , if I had foreseen the consequences . But what is done can not be undone ; and we must make the best of it . '—I offered no reply : I saw that we were both completely at the mercy of those who had taken advantage of us,—that our positions were indeed equal in this one respect ; and I fervently hoped that we might not live to rue the adventures of the last twelve hours ! "
658112	658204	658083	658083	he	1539	" The two weeks passed away : we met again ; and on this occasion the invitation to Cholmondeley 's house was renewed — insisted upon — and , alas ! accepted . I will not dwell upon this portion of my narrative . Suffice it to say that Cholmondeley 's residence was converted into the scene of unlawful pleasure and voluptuousness,—that Adeline with her lover in one room , and myself with Dunstable in another , entered upon a career of wantonness , which grew more insatiable as it progressed ! "
658353	658478	658479	658479	I	0	" That night , at eleven o'clock , Adeline came to my garret . I was reduced to despair ; and could offer her no consolation , although she needed it even more — oh ! far more than I. The moment she found herself alone with me , she gave way to a paroxysm of grief — a convulsion of anguish , which alarmed me . I implored her to restrain her emotions , or we should be overheard . She sank upon my bed ; and I soon perceived that she was enduring great bodily pain in addition to deep mental affliction . An idea of the terrible truth flashed through my brain : she was in the agony of premature labour ! "
658681	658775	658776	658776	I	0	" An hour afterwards Adeline dragged herself back to the room in which she slept . That was a fearful night for us both : it was for me — it must have been for her ! I never closed my eyes : this terrible event weighed upon my soul like a crime . I felt as if I had been the accomplice in some awful deed of darkness . The cold and placid moon seemed to reproach me — as if its bright orb were heaven 's own all - seeing eye ! "
658886	658971	658881	658881	God	880	" I knelt down at last , and tried to pray . I called upon heaven — I called upon my father — I called upon my brother , to pardon me ! Then once more I turned my eyes towards the moon ; and its reproachful , chilling glance seemed to penetrate to the depths of my secret soul,—singling me , me out for its maddening scrutiny,—marking me alone , of all the human race , for its calm , but bitter contemplation . "
659015	659137	659138	659138	I	0	" Never was morning more welcome to the guilty imagination haunted by the fearful apparitions of the night , than it was to me . I composed myself as well as I could ; but when I surveyed my countenance in the glass , I was dismayed by its awful pallor — its haggardness — its care - worn look . I did not dare plead illness , as an excuse for keeping my chamber ; because I was too anxious to ascertain what course Miss Enfield would pursue to escape those inquiries that her appearance , I felt convinced , must elicit . Besides , there was something in my box which — but of that no matter at present . "
659330	659419	659328	659328	Adeline	1545	" The breakfast was over ; and we all repaired to the school - room . As we were proceeding thither , Miss Enfield drew me aside for a moment , and said in a hurried whisper , ' For heaven 's sake , keep my secret , dearest Lydia : the honour of a noble family depends upon your prudence!'—I pressed her hand in acquiescence.—'I will ever be your friend , dearest Lydia , ' she repeated.—Then we separated to take our respective places in the school . "
659549	659656	659540	659540	I	0	" Mrs. Lambkin summoned Miss Rhodes , Miss Jessop , and myself to accompany her . Then Adeline rose , and exclaimed , ' Surely , Mrs. Lambkin , you will not subject these three young ladies to the indignity of examining their trunks?'—'Yes , but I will though , ' cried Mrs. Lambkin , her anger getting the better of her respect for the scion of aristocracy.—Adeline sank back in her seat : and never — never shall I forget the imploring , despairing , heart - rending glance which she darted upon me , as I followed the school - mistress from the room . "
659912	660112	659901	659901	she	1547	" Miss Rhodes and Miss Jessop had gone down stairs ; Jessica , Mrs. Lambkin , and myself were alone together . During the few minutes that intervened between the search in my small boxes and the visit to my large trunk , I revolved in my mind the only alternatives which a certain discovery that I now saw to be inevitable , would leave me : namely , to shield Miss Enfield by accusing myself ; or to save myself by exposing her . Then I thought whether I really should save my own honour by this latter course ; for , although my frailty had led to none such consequences as those which were connected with Adeline , nevertheless she might proclaim me to have been the paramour of Lord Dunstable . Moreover , I remembered her appealing , despairing look;—I called to mind all the promises of friendship and assistance which she had made me ; I knew that she belonged to a noble , wealthy , and influential family ; and I had such confidence in the generosity and grateful nature of her disposition , that I felt fully persuaded she would never abandon me . "
660241	660557	660216	660219	The school - mistress	42305	" Jessica gave vent to an exclamation of horror and alarm , and was rushing towards the door , when Mrs. Lambkin , recovering from the sudden shock which this spectacle had occasioned , held her back , saying , ' In the name of God be cautious ; or my establishment will be ruined ! ' Then turning towards me , her lips quivering and white with rage , she said , in a low hollow tone , ' No wonder you are so pale and ill this morning ! But must I look upon you as the murderess——.'—'Oh ! no , no , madam , ' I exclaimed , falling on my knees , and joining my hands together ; ' that child was born dead . Listen to me , and I will tell you all ; I will confess every thing!'—'There appears to be but little now to confess , ' returned Mrs. Lambkin ; ' and I have no time for idle conversation . The honour of my institution is seriously compromised : I will pay you the amount due to you , and you can leave my service this minute . It will be your fault if the real cause ever transpires . '—'Ah ! madam , ' I exclaimed , ' shall I not then be looked upon as the thief who stole your spoons?'—'No , ' answered the school - mistress . ' I will declare in the presence of the entire establishment that my search has proved ineffectual in all quarters ; and I will even allow you the merit of having left of your own accord , for the same reason which prompted Miss Rhodes and Miss Jessop to give me notice . ' Mrs. Lambkin then turned towards Jessica , to whom she enjoined the strictest secrecy concerning the discovery of the dead child . "
660715	660844	660845	660845	We	17889	them!'—"Wretch ! ' she cried , ' would you have me dispose of your bastard 's corpse for you?'—This insulting question brought the blood into my cheeks . Oh ! it was too much to be thus reviled for a disgrace which did not really belong to me . Mrs. Lambkin saw how I was agitated , and , dreading a scene , she said in a low tone , ' You can remain here till to - morrow , Miss Hutchinson . If you choose to walk out this evening , when it is dark , you have my permission . But , in the meantime , you will have the kindness to keep your box carefully locked . '—I understood the hint , and bowed acquiescence . "
660901	661254	660896	660896	I	0	" The day passed slowly away . Fortunately the missing spoons were found in the evening : they had merely been mislaid by the cook or scullery - girl . I retired to my chamber at an earlier hour than usual : the presence of the school - mistress was irksome to me in the room below . In a short time Adeline came to me . She had stolen away to have an opportunity of conversing with me . Then I narrated to her all that had occurred in the morning . She threw herself upon my neck , and thanked me with tears in her eyes for having saved her from the depths of disgrace . She called me her ' sister'—her ' friend'—her ' dearest , dearest friend ; ' and vowed she would never forget the immense service which I had rendered her . Then I felt glad that I had acted as I had done . She even offered to go out , when the other inmates of the house had retired to rest , and dispose of the corpse of the child — her own child ; but I knew that it would be death to one in her condition to venture abroad in the night - air . I accordingly undertook to perform that task also . We next conversed on my own prospects . I was averse to return home : I dreaded the numerous questions which my father and brother were certain to put to me . Adeline , who was an uncommonly worldly - minded girl for her age , instantly suggested that I should take a respectable lodging in London , and she would undertake to procure for me a situation as a nursery - governess . The Christmas holidays were at hand : she would be returning in the course of ten days to her parents ' house in Belgrave Square ; and she assured me that she should then have an opportunity of exercising her influence in my favour . To these proposals I assented ; and she withdrew . "
661377	661401	661430	661431	Mrs. Lambkin	1547	" I now breathed more easily ; but it was not without some difficulty that I found my way back to Belvidere House . "
661540	661817	661537	661538	the widow	4283	" I sent a porter for my boxes ; and then my first care was to write a letter to my father . This I found to be no easy task . I recoiled from the idea of sending a tissue of falsehoods to that dear , confiding parent . Nevertheless , the duty was imperative . I accordingly concocted a letter , in which I informed him ' that having been grievously insulted by Mrs. Lambkin , I had left her service ; but that I had met with a sincere friend in the Honourable Miss Adeline Enfield , one of the young ladies of the establishment , who had taken a great interest in me , and had not only promised to procure me a situation as a nursery - governess in a wealthy family , but had also recommended me , in the interval , to the care of a most respectable widow . ' By return of post I received my father 's answer . He regretted my precipitation in leaving Mrs. Lambkin until I had written to consult him ; but admitted that the provocation in searching my boxes was grave . He expressed his entire confidence in my discretion , and declared his delight at the friendship I had formed with Miss Enfield . But he charged me to return home the moment I experienced the least difficulty in obtaining another situation . He concluded by stating that either he or Edgar would have repaired to London to see me ; but that the expense was an almost insuperable barrier to such a step , their limited means being considered . "
662059	662241	662049	662049	She	1545	" I will not dwell tediously on this portion of my narrative . On the following day I called upon Lady Penfeather , and was received very graciously . After some conversation , she engaged me at a salary of twenty guineas a - year ; and I was to remove to her house immediately . She was an easy , affable , good - natured person — about thirty - six years of age , and not very handsome . Her husband , Sir Wentworth Penfeather , was three or four years older than herself , and was a fine , tall , good - looking man . They had three children , whose ages were between six and ten : the two eldest were girls , and the youngest a boy . These were to be my pupils . I hastened back to my lodging , and wrote a letter to my father informing him of my good luck . Then I settled with my kind landlady , and removed to Sir Wentworth Penfeather 's residence in Cavendish Square . "
662401	662719	662394	662394	I	0	" Three months had now passed ; and I had never seen Adeline since she called upon me at my lodging . I knew that she was not to return to Mrs. Lambkin 's establishment , her education being completed ( completed indeed ! ) ; and I felt hurt that she had not found a leisure moment either to call or write to me . I accordingly wrote a note requesting to see her . I was anxious to obtain another situation , and thus escape from Sir Wentworth Penfeather 's importunities . On the following day Adeline called , and desired to see me alone . I was struck by her cold and distant manner . ' Miss Hutchinson , ' she said , ' you must not be astonished at my conduct in not visiting you . You did me a great service : I have returned the obligation by procuring you a good situation . There are now no debts on either side . Our ways lie so totally different in the world , that were I to maintain an intimacy with you , my behaviour would be subject to the most annoying comments . We have both of us a deep interest in keeping each other 's secrets . Were you , in a moment of anger against me , to state that it was my child that was discovered in your trunk , who would believe you ? whereas , if you proclaim our respective amours with Captain Cholmondeley and Lord Dunstable , you publish your own shame at the time you denounce me . I am sorry to be compelled to speak thus to you ; but I should have thought that your own good sense would have taught you the immeasurable distance which lies between you and me . Henceforth we are mere acquaintances , and nothing more . ' "
663096	663253	663086	663086	herself	1564	" The moment her back was turned , Lord Dunstable said to me in a hurried whisper , ' Dearest Lydia , you look more beautiful than ever ! I have never ceased to think of you since we last met . I have much to say to you : will you meet me to - morrow afternoon , somewhere ? Say in the Pantheon , ( it is not very far from hence ) at three o'clock precisely?'—I murmured an affirmative ; and at that moment Lady Penfeather returned , accompanied by the children . Lord Dunstable affected to admire them very highly ; and the mother was quite charmed with his amiability . I could not help noticing how much his continental tour had improved him ; indeed , I had never seen him looking so handsome before : my heart was once more filled with the fondest hopes;—for I really loved that man . "
663402	663616	663644	663644	he	17951	" He began by saying ' What must you have thought of my conduct in leaving England so abruptly?'—'It gave me very great pain , ' I answered ; ' and , after all your promises to me , I considered that I had reason to be both dissatisfied and unhappy . '—'Let me speak candidly to you , ' he continued . ' I am so circumstanced , in consequence of being entirely dependent on my father , that marriage is for the present impossible . But I love you very sincerely , and absence has augmented my attachment . Are you happy where you are?'—I then candidly acquainted him with Sir Wentworth Penfeather 's conduct towards me , and stated my determination to leave my present situation as soon as I could obtain another.—'Sir Wentworth , ' continued Lord Dunstable , ' is the greatest scoundrel in respect to women , in London . If you do not yield to his wishes , he will slander you to his wife in private : and you will be turned away some fine morning without knowing why , and without a character . '—'Can he be so base ? ' I exclaimed , alarmed at this information.—'He is indeed , ' replied Dunstable . "
663754	664200	663751	663751	we	17954	" But do not imagine that I did all this without a pang , when I thought of my poor father and my brother ! Oh ! no — I wept bitter , burning tears at my weakness , after I quitted my lover ; and I resolved to recall my promise to accept his protection . In this better frame of mind I returned to Cavendish Square . The moment I entered , the servant who opened the door informed me that Lady Penfeather desired to speak to me . I proceeded to the drawing - room , where her ladyship was sitting . Sir Wentworth was also there . I immediately suspected that there was something wrong . Lady Penfeather said , in a cold and freezing tone , ' Miss Hutchinson , I have no farther need of your services . Here is the amount due to you , together with a quarter 's salary in addition , as I have not given you a quarter 's notice . '—'This is somewhat peremptory , madam , ' I observed , when I could recover from this sudden and unexpected announcement.—'I should be even justified in turning you out of the house , without the quarter 's salary , Miss , ' retorted the lady : ' but I do not wish to behave too harshly to you ; I would not , however , advise you to apply to me for a character . '—'My God ! ' I exclaimed ; ' what have I done?'—'The levity of your conduct has been noticed by Sir Wentworth , ' returned Lady Penfeather.—'Sir Wentworth ! ' I repeated , unable to believe my own ears ; and then , in a moment , Lord Dunstable 's words flashed to my memory.—'Yes , Miss Hutchinson , ' continued Lady Penfeather ; ' and as I recalled to mind the significant glances which you exchanged with Lord Dunstable yesterday , I deemed it my duty to have you watched this afternoon . Do you desire to know any more?'—'It is perfectly true that I have been with Lord Dunstable ere now , ' I exclaimed , my blood boiling with indignation : ' but it is because I would not listen to the infamous proposals of your husband , madam , that I have been maligned , and am treated thus . '—Sir Wentworth started from his seat , livid with rage ; and her ladyship ordered me to quit the room . I perceived that all attempts at explanation in respect to her husband 's conduct were vain ; and I accordingly obeyed this mandate . "
664383	664529	664532	664532	I	0	" Alas ! those few days were prolonged into a few weeks . I did not dare to write home : I fondly hoped that my father imagined me still to be in Lady Penfeather 's establishment ; and I felt convinced there was no chance of his coming to London so long as he entertained this impression . Lord Dunstable continued very kind to me . He had hired magnificent apartments for me in Jermyn Street , and allowed me a carriage , besides a handsome weekly allowance . He passed with me all the time he could spare from his regimental duties ; but he never went abroad with me — except to a private box at the theatre on two or three occasions ; and then he was so afraid of being seen by his relations , that I was quite miserable . "
664662	664797	664644	664644	his	42264	" But one morning I was aroused from this dream of irresolution — vacillation — weakness — and crime . I was seated alone at breakfast , whiling away an hour with the newspaper . Suddenly my eyes fell upon an advertisement at the head of the second column of the first page . Oh ! never shall I forget the agony of my feelings — the deep , deep anguish of my soul , as I read these words:—'L. H. , your father is at the point of death . Your afflicted brother implores you to return home . For God 's sake , delay not ; or it will be too late ! All shall be forgiven and forgotten . '—And in the corner was the name of my father 's village ! "
664931	665139	664918	664918	I	0	" I lavished gold upon the postillions to induce them to spare not their horses . The chaise rushed along like the wind . God knows what were my feelings during the few hours which that terrible journey lasted . I can not attempt to describe them . Oh ! if indiscretion and crime have their enjoyments , they are also doomed to experience bitter — bitter penalties . And my punishment was now at hand . It was not so long since I had journeyed along that road with my father — when he first conducted me up to London . Then we had travelled by the coach , and not so rapidly as I was now retracing the same path . Then , too , I had marked many of the most prominent features on the road and in the adjacent country,—here a church — there a picturesque farm — a cottage — a mill — or a hamlet ! As I was hurried along in the post - chaise , I looked ever and anon from the window ; oh ! there were the same objects I had before observed;—there they were , apparently unchanged;—but I — my God — was I the same ? "
665406	665531	665397	665397	God	880	" And now the chaise rolled through the village : the humble inhabitants rushed to their doors — Ah ! how many faces that I knew , were thrust forth to gaze at the equipage . I can picture to myself that when the condemned malefactor , on the morning of his death , is advancing towards the scaffold , he closes his eyes just at the moment when he feels that he has reached that point whence his glances might embrace all its hideous reality . Urged by a similar impulse , I covered my face with my hands the instant the chaise swept from the main - road towards the home of my childhood . I dared not glance in that direction ! "
665603	665751	665590	665590	I	0	" From that instant all consciousness abandoned me for several hours . Indeed , it was not until the next morning that I awoke as it were from a hideous dream,—and yet awoke to find it all a fearful reality . I was in bed : my poor brother — pale and care - worn — was leaning over me . In a short time I learnt all . My father was indeed no more . He had breathed his last while I was yet on my way to implore his dying blessing . And he had left me his blessing — he did not curse me , although I had been the cause of his death ! Nor did my brother reproach me : on the contrary , he whispered to me words of consolation , and even of hope ! Poor father — beloved brother ! "
666014	666114	666117	666117	my	0	" And I gazed upon his cold clay — and I followed him to the grave which was hollowed for him near the walls of that church wherein for twenty years he had preached the ways of virtue — those ways which he himself had so steadily pursued . Oh ! when the minister came to those solemn words ' Earth to earth , and ashes to ashes,'—and when the cold clay rattled down upon the coffin - lid,—what feelings were mine ! You may probably divine them ; but the world has no language that can express them ! "
666301	666587	666290	666291	Lord Dunstable;—as	1568	" Was I , then , the murderess of my poor father and my noble - hearted brother ? If my hand had not struck a dagger into their hearts , my conduct had nevertheless hurried them to the grave . I hated — I abhorred myself . But the bitterness of my reflections was in some degree mitigated by the hasty preparations which I was compelled to make for an immediate return to London . I had not money enough to enable me to take a post - chaise ; and I was therefore obliged to wait for the Portsmouth coach , which passed through the village on its way to the metropolis . I had already made up my mind what course to adopt . Now that my father and brother were no more , I could not bear the idea of remaining in the place where we had all been once so happy together : I moreover knew that the parsonage - house would soon be required by the new curate who had been appointed as my late father 's successor . I accordingly sent for the village lawyer , and gave him instructions to realize in ready money all the little property which had become my sad inheritance . I told him that in a few days I would let him know my address in London ; and that he was to forward me the proceeds of the sale . But I retained a few relics to remind me of my departed relatives ; and as I wept bitterly over them , I took a solemn vow that my future conduct should prove the sincerity of my repentance for the past ! "
666754	667055	667058	667059	a coroner	15836	" The coach , on its arrival in London , stopped at the White Horse Cellar . I took a cab , and immediately proceeded to the house of the surgeon who had written to me . There it was that my brother had breathed his last ! The duel had taken place in the neighbourhood of Bayswater : my brother received his adversary 's ball in the breast ; and although he lived for some hours afterwards , he never spoke again . Lord Dunstable conjured the surgeon to show the unfortunate young man every attention , and then took his immediate departure for the continent . But , from motives of delicacy , neither poor Edgar nor his lordship had communicated to the medical man the cause of the duel . It was only by means of papers found about my brother 's person that the surgeon discovered that he had a sister , and ascertained where that sister lived . In the hurry , alarm , and confusion which followed the duel , the surgeon had forgotten to demand , and Lord Dunstable was too bewildered to communicate , any particulars relative to the family or friends of the young man who had fallen in the hostile encounter . Thus , had it not been for certain memoranda which were discovered in my poor brother 's pocket - book , the surgeon would not have known to whom to write , and I might have remained for months — or even years — in ignorance of that dear relative 's untimely fate . Full well did I comprehend the delicacy of his own conduct : he had not left a written trace which might expose my shame by revealing the motives that had led to the duel ! "
667267	667845	667846	667846	I	0	" Six months passed away : during that period I was treated with the utmost kindness by the surgeon and his family . But misfortune suddenly overtook that excellent man . The villany of a false friend plunged him from affluence into comparative poverty . This abrupt change preyed so deeply on his mind , that he put a period to his existence . His brother — a man of morose disposition and selfish character — undertook to provide for the widow and her children ; and I was then compelled once more to shift for myself . I took an affectionate farewell of those who had behaved so well towards me , and removed to a humble lodging , where I soon experienced all the wretchedness of my lonely and unfriended position . I inserted advertisements in the newspapers , for the purpose of obtaining a situation as teacher in a school or governess in a respectable family ; and although I received many replies , I failed to give a satisfactory account of myself . I could not refer to Mrs. Lambkin , nor to Lady Penfeather ; and I found that my orphan condition excited but little sympathy in my favour . Thus a year — an entire year — passed ; and at the end , I found myself without hope , and without resources . I knew not what would become of me . At length I mustered up all my courage , and proceeded to Rossville House . I inquired for Miss Adeline Enfield . The servant demanded my name , and left me standing in the hall for nearly ten minutes until his return . I was then shown into a small but magnificently furnished parlour ; and almost immediately afterwards Adeline made her appearance . She advanced towards me with the most chilling hauteur of manner , and desired to know ' my business . '—'Oh ! Miss Adeline , ' I exclaimed , ' have I no claims upon your friendship?'—'You must remember what took place between us the last time we met , ' she answered . ' If you require pecuniary assistance , I will succour you for the last time ; but circumstances compel me to decline seeing you , or even knowing you in future . '—'And is this the way you treat me after all I suffered on your account ? ' I said , bursting into tears . ' Do you not reflect that your reputation is in my hands?'—'If you menace me , Miss Hutchinson , ' she said , ' I shall know how to treat you . In a word , who would believe your story were you to proclaim it ? You would only draw down upon yourself the vengeance of my family by endeavouring to shift your own disgrace on to my shoulders . The whole world would denounce you as a common impostress . '—An instant 's reflection showed me that these assurances were strictly true . But my pride was hurt , and my feelings were poignantly wrung by the blackness of Adeline 's ingratitude . Pushing aside her hand which tendered me a purse of gold , I exclaimed , ' From this moment , Miss Enfield , I consider myself absolved from all motives of secrecy on your account;'—and , before she could utter a word of reply , I left the room . "
667994	668220	667944	667944	she	27841	" I had eaten nothing since the morning : I was hungry , and I had not a farthing in my pocket . It was moreover cold ; and I knew not where to sleep that night . Oh ! then how bitterly did I regret the ebullition of pride and feeling which had prevented me from accepting the purse which Adeline had proffered me ! It was now too late to conciliate her : I had used menaces ; and I felt convinced that it would be impossible to make my peace with that proud and determined spirit . I wandered about the streets in a state of mind which every moment suggested suicide . Then did all the happiness of home and of the days of innocence recur to my memory with a force that nearly crushed me ! I thought of my dear departed father and my noble - hearted brother — both hurried to the grave by my wickedness ! Evening came — and I was still a wanderer in the streets , without a hope — without a feasible project ! Hour after hour passed : midnight was proclaimed by the iron tongues of the thousand towers of this mighty city;—and I sank exhausted on the step of a door in Gerrard Street , Soho . I then became insensible . "
668845	669210	668841	668842	the girl	27605	" I ate a very hearty breakfast , and then lay down again ; for I was not quite recovered from the fatigues of the preceding day . I fell into a doze ; and when I awoke , Mrs. Harpy was once more standing by the side of the bed . ' Here are your things , my dear , ' she said : ' I paid your landlady fifteen shillings . That was for two weeks ' rent owing , and a week she claimed because you had left without giving notice . She gives an excellent character of you , and proves all you have told me to be quite true . I am really as fond of you as if you were my own daughter . You are looking much better ; and a nice little boiled fowl , with a glass of Port , will set you to rights . What time do you like to dine , dear?'—'My good lady , ' I replied , ' you are heaping favours upon me , and I have not the means of paying you for any one of them . '—'Don't talk of that , my dear girl , ' ejaculated Mrs. Harpy . ' I 'm sure it is quite a pleasure to do any thing for you . But , by - the - by , ' she added , ' you may just as well give me a memorandum for what I am paying for you ; and as I shall be able to procure some nice , easy , genteel avocation for you , you can reimburse me at your convenience . '—Of course I was delighted at this opportunity of testifying my honest intentions and good - will ; and I instantly affixed my signature to a slip of paper which she produced from her pocket . Mrs. Harpy kissed me very affectionately ; and then , casually observing that she kept a very genteel boarding - house , concluded by saying that she would ask some of the young ladies to come up after dinner and keep me company for an hour or two . "
669561	669751	669755	669756	the servant	2459	" I kept my bed , by Mrs. Harpy 's advice , all that day ; but I did not feel sleepy in the evening , after the young ladies had left me;—and even if the contrary were the case , I should not have been able to indulge a wish for repose , for after eleven o'clock the whole establishment seemed to be in a constant bustle . People ran up and down stairs ; doors were banged ; shouts of laughter awoke every echo in the place ; glasses rattled on trays that were carried to the different rooms ; and the boisterous mirth of men rose at intervals above the other sounds and noises . This confusion , as it appeared to me , continued until about two o'clock ; and then the house became quiet . My suspicions were seriously excited relative to the respectability of Mrs. Harpy 's establishment ; but I endeavoured to quiet them by all the arguments I could conceive in that lady 's favour , and which were prompted by my gratitude towards her . At length I fell asleep . "
669981	670562	670563	670563	I	0	" I threw myself on a chair and burst into a flood of tears . Merciful heavens ! for what fate was I reserved ? Had I indeed fallen so low that my only home was a loathsome den of iniquity like that ? For some minutes after the occurrence of the incident just related , I felt as if my senses were leaving me . Suddenly the door opened , and Mrs. Harpy made her appearance . She seemed astonished at the condition in which she found me , and was about to make some remark , when I threw myself at her feet , exclaiming , ' I conjure you , madam — if you have any pity for a poor friendless orphan — let me leave your house this moment!'—'And where will you go , my dear child ? ' she said.—'To the workhouse , ma'am : anywhere , rather than remain here ! ' I answered.—'This is a pretty recompense for my kindness towards you , ' she observed . ' If it had not been for me , you would have died in the streets . '—'Far better for me were it , had I so perished ! ' I exclaimed.—'Now , Miss , ' cried Mrs. Harpy , growing angry , ' what is the meaning of all this nonsense?'—'Can you ask me ? ' I demanded . ' Oh ! that the feelings which prompted you to assist me , should have been any other save the disinterested benevolence for which I so sincerely thanked you!'—'Then you know where you are , Miss , I suppose ? ' she said , with a leer ; and , before I had time to give any reply , she added , ' I meant you to find it out in a day or two ; and it 's as well now as a few hours later . Here you are , and here you will stay . You shall be treated just in proportion as you behave ; and this evening , I shall introduce some fine nobleman or gentleman to you . '—'Never ! ' I cried : then moving towards the door , I said , ' Detain me at your peril!'—'So I shall , ' answered Mrs. Harpy , coolly . ' I 've got your I. O. U. for twenty pounds ; and if you go any where , it will be to Whitecross Street prison , before you 're many hours older . Remember , it 's for necessaries ; and so no plea of minority or any other gammon of that kind , will avail you . '—I remembered the slip of paper which I had signed ; and my heart sank within me , as I saw how completely I was in the power of that vile woman.—'So now you understand how you are situated , ' she continued , softening in her tone and manner . ' This is what all young girls like you must come to , sooner or later ; and you 'll be very happy here , I can assure you . This evening a nobleman who patronizes my house , will call upon you ; and if you have any of your nonsense with him , I 'll send you straight to Whitecross Street to - morrow morning . '—With these words she left the room , locking the door behind her . "
670705	670802	670809	670810	that nobleman	28768	" At ten o'clock the servant brought up waxlights , and a tray containing a bottle of champagne , glasses , and several plates of fruits and cakes . I watched these preparations in a state of dumb despair , bordering on stupefaction . Another half hour passed ; and steps once more ascended the stairs . My heart palpitated violently ! The door was thrown open;—a man elegantly dressed entered the room;—I cast one glance towards him , and , uttering a faint cry , sank insensible on the carpet . It was Lord Dunstable ! "
671326	671626	671311	671311	he	0	" Scarcely could he have had time to gain the street door , when Mrs. Harpy bounded into my room , exclaiming , ' Well , my dear , you have behaved very well , for his lordship went away in an excellent humour . What did he give you?'—'Give me ! ' I repeated , surveying that horrible woman with mingled indignation and terror.—'By Jove , he 's a lord in name and nature both ! ' ejaculated Mrs. Harpy , as her eyes caught sight of a bank - note which lay upon the table . ' Twenty pounds , as I 'm a living woman ! ' and she clutched the object of her delighted avarice.—'Hold , madam ! ' I exclaimed . ' Not one farthing of that money will I retain ! The man who gave it killed my brother!'—'I do n't care who he 's killed , or who he means to kill , ' answered the old woman , ' But here 's his money ; and that I intend to keep . '—'You keep it ! ' I cried.—'Yes ; who else ? What an ungrateful hussy you must be , after I took you out of the street ! This room and your board will cost you a guinea a - day . Then your clothes , washing , and other things are all extra . So I 'll keep nineteen pound fifteen shillings on account ; and you shall have a crown for pocket money . If that is not generous , I do n't know what is ; but I like to do the thing what 's right . '—With these words she threw five shillings on the table , and walked off with the twenty pound note . "
671976	672378	671966	671966	I	0	" Pardon me , if I dwell for a few minutes upon the characteristics of those houses of abomination , in one of which I was now located . Mrs. Harpy was an admirable type of her profession . She was mean and griping in the extreme when wringing an extra shilling , or even an extra penny , from her boarders , as we were called ; and yet she was profuse and liberal in supplying us with costly wine . If we complained of having to eat cold meat two days running , she would storm , and declare that we lived too well as it was;—but she would think nothing of giving us a bottle of champagne , which could not have cost her less than eight or ten shillings , after dinner . She took from us every farthing that we received , and invariably made us out her debtors , although she never showed us any accounts . To give you an idea of her way of managing , I will relate a little anecdote . One Saturday afternoon , Matilda ( whom I have before mentioned ) asked her for a sovereign ; adding , ' You know I have given you altogether thirteen guineas this week . '—'Thirteen guineas ! ' screamed the old woman : ' I 'll take my Bible oath it was only twelve . '—'Well , call it even twelve , if you like , ' said the young female : ' you can well spare me a sovereign . '—'Lord bless the girl ! ' cried Mrs. Harpy . ' Why , there 's seven guineas for your board and lodging ; two guineas for your washing ; that 's ten ; a guinea for pocket money ; and a guinea for letters and needles and thread ; that makes up the twelve , or else I never went to school to learn compound addition . '—'And multiplication too , ' said Matilda . ' Why , I had but one letter all the week , and that was paid . '—'Well , my dear , ' answered Mrs. Harpy , ' we will ask the postman . Come ! I 'll stand another bottle of champagne now , and you shall have an extra sovereign for yourself next Saturday , if you 're lucky in the meantime . ' "
672774	673278	672724	672725	the bullies	18148	" Sometimes , the bullies would attempt a similar scheme of extortion in reference to individuals who came voluntarily to the house ; and if the latter resisted the exorbitant demands made upon them , they were not unfrequently maltreated in a most shameful manner . It often happened that a gentleman would become a regular visitor to the house , if he took a fancy to one particular boarder : in such a case he probably adopted a false name , and took every precaution to avoid discovery as to who he was . The girl whom he visited , was then directed to pump him ; and if she failed to elicit the desired particulars , one of the bullies was instructed to watch and dog him when he left the house . By these means , his real name , residence , position , and circumstances , were speedily ascertained . If he were moving in a very respectable sphere , was married , or had any particular motives to induce him to keep his intrigue secret , he was the very kind of person who suited Mrs. Harpy and her bullies . The next time he visited the house , he would be surrounded by those ruffians , menaced with exposure , and forced to pay a considerable sum of money to purchase silence . But the evil did not terminate there . From that time forth , the unfortunate gentleman would be periodically beset by his persecutors ; and fresh extortions would be effected to renew the pledge of secrecy on their part . Married men , moving in respectable spheres , have been driven to suicide by this atrocious system ! Many a time have I read , in the newspapers , instances of self - destruction on the part of gentlemen whose pecuniary , social , or domestic circumstances afforded not the least appearance of any possible motive for such a deed;—and then I have thought within myself that those poor victims had been hunted to death by extortioners of the class which I have described ! The man who has a character to lose , or who has the peace of his family to consider , knows not how fearfully both are compromised , both endangered , when he so far forgets himself as to set foot in a house of infamy . He may imagine that his secret never can transpire — that neither his family nor friends can , by any possible means , ever discover that he has thus erred;—but , if he be an individual , who , by his wealth and social position , appears worth the trouble of looking after , he will most assuredly find himself a prey to the vilest of extortioners . His happiness will be undermined and destroyed ; he will live in constant dread of exposure : and deeply — deeply will he rue the day that he ever set foot in a brothel ! "
673862	674029	674033	674033	I	0	" Some weeks elapsed ere I was completely aware of the infamies which were perpetrated in Mrs. Harpy 's den ; and then I resolved to leave the place , whatever might subsequently become of me . At length an opportunity served ; and one evening , with only a small parcel of necessaries under my arm , and a few shillings in my purse , I slipped out of that scene of iniquities . I can not enter into further details ; suffice it to say , from that moment commenced an existence of fearful vicissitudes,—starvation one day , luxury the next,—the most abrupt descents into the lowest abyss of destitution , and the most sudden elevations to comfort , though still a career of infamy,—wanderings for many , many nights together , without knowing where to lay my head , and then a lodging and a good bed ! Oh ! it was horrible , that precariousness of life to which I was doomed ! "
674158	674541	674542	674542	I	0	" But my own vicissitudes continued ! Oh ! let those who are prone to turn away from the unfortunate woman with disgust and abhorrence , rather exercise a feeling of sympathy in her behalf . She does not drag her weary frame nightly along the pavement , through choice , but from necessity . In all weathers must she ply her miserable trade — or starve . Then to what indignities is she subjected ! Every drunken ruffian considers himself justified in ill - using her : every brutal fellow jostles against her , and addresses her in terms of insult . Do they think that , because she is compelled to ply her hideous trade , she has no feelings ? But it is chiefly from the young men who rove about the streets at night , smoking cigars , wearing pea - coats , and carrying sticks , that the unfortunate woman is doomed to receive the deepest indignity:—yes , from those who ought to have more chivalry in their dispositions ! There is one base extortion to which the unfortunate woman is subjected , and which I must mention . I allude to the necessity of feeing the policeman belonging to that beat where the unhappy creature walks . The miserable wretch who deviated from this practice , either through inability or unwillingness , would never have a moment 's peace . The moment she was accosted in the street by a gentleman , the officer would come up and order her brutally to move on ; and perhaps he would add violence to harsh words . Then , on the slightest pretence — and often without any at all — the miserable woman is dragged off to the station - house , charged with creating a disturbance , and taken next morning before the magistrate . In vain may she protest her innocence of the offence charged against her : in vain may she denounce the vindictive motives of the officer . The word of one policeman is deemed worth the oaths of ten thousand degraded females ; and the accused is sentenced to Bridewell accordingly . No one can conceive the amount of the wrongs inflicted by the police upon the most miserable class of women ! "

Lovely flowed the river amidst the meads that were clothed in the country 's everlasting green . Busy hamlets , neat farm - houses , and the chateaux of nobles or wealthy gentlemen , varied the appearance of the magnificent landscape . Although it was the middle of November , the climate was as mild and genial as that of September in the British Islands : the vines had not been entirely stripped of their luscious fruit ; and the citrons , so plentiful that they were but little prized by the inhabitants , grew wild by the road - side . Here groups of mighty chesnut - trees afforded a delicious shade to the way - worn traveller : there the tapering spire of a village church , or the white walls and slated roof of some lordly country - seat , appeared above the verdant mulberry - groves . Nevertheless , the woodlands of Castelcicala were not characterised by that gloominess of foliage which invests the English and German forests with such awful solemnity ; for the leaves were of a brighter green , and the density of their shade was relieved by the luxuriousness of the botany that spread its rich and varied colours over the surface of the land . The banks of the Ferretti yielded an immense profusion of aromatic herbs , which imparted a delicious perfume and , at the same time , a freshness to the air . Much as those two travellers had been accustomed to admire the loveliness of their own native England , they could not avoid exclamations of joy and surprise as they pursued their way amidst the fertile plains of Castelcicala . We need scarcely inform our readers that those travellers were Richard Markham and his faithful Morcar . Our hero , dressed in a neat but modest garb , and carrying a portfolio of drawing materials under his arm , journeyed along a little in advance of his attendant , who bore a small valise of necessaries . In his pocket - book Richard had secured the two passports , for himself and follower , which the interest of Mario Bazzano had obtained , and which were made out in fictitious names . Fastened to a riband round his neck , and carefully concealed beneath his raiment , was a small morocco leather case , containing the sealed letter left him , with such mysterious instructions , by Thomas Armstrong . The well - filled purse which the generosity of the Grand Duchess had supplied , and a map of the Duchy , completed the stock of materials with which the travellers had deemed it fit to furnish themselves . Their way now lay , according to the advice which Richard had received from the Grand Duchess , towards Friuli : thence it was his intention to strike off abruptly in a longitudinal direction , and , passing between Dandolo and Lipari , proceed straight toward the Neapolitan frontier . On the fourth evening the two travellers arrived at Friuli , having walked upon an average thirty miles each day , and slept at night in some cottage or farm - house . They did not , however , penetrate into the fine and spacious town which they had now reached ; but stopped at a small tavern in the suburbs . There they ordered supper , which was served up to them in the public room , as Richard did not think it prudent to excite notice by having a private apartment . Several other persons were sitting in the public room , busily engaged in imbibing the various liquors suited to their respective palates , and discussing , with great solemnity , the political aspect of the State . By their conversation Markham judged that they must be the small tradesmen of the suburbs of the town , as they all seemed well acquainted with each other , and spoke as if they were in the habit of meeting at that tavern every evening after the bustle and cares of the day 's business . "

675847	675851	675832	675832	he	27107	" said Richard , "

676117	676124	676115	676115	him	18238	" asked one of the company . "
676134	676139	676129	676129	he	18238	" was the reply ; "

676212	676317	676206	676206	them	18245	" exclaimed several voices . The emotions of our hero , while this discourse was progressing , may be more readily imagined than explained : but prudence on his own account , and obedience to the advice of the Grand Duchess , sealed his lips . Morcar continued to eat and drink without excitement , because the conversation passing around was totally unintelligible to him . The relative of the mayor 's adjunct was dilating pompously on the duties of a sovereign , when a post - chaise drove furiously up to the door of the tavern . All was immediately bustle and confusion . "
676324	676409	676451	676452	Signor Bazzano	1532	" shouted a voice in the passage . Then commenced the rattling of harness,—the running hither and thither of ostlers,—and the usual calling and bawling which characterise such occasions . All the inmates of the coffee - room , with the exception of Markham and the gipsy , rushed out to stare at the equipage . Scarcely was the room thus left comparatively empty , when a tall man , wrapped in an ample travelling cloak , entered hastily , followed by the landlord . "
676429	676434	676437	676437	sir	26649	" cried the traveller . "
676439	676450	676437	676437	sir	26649	" said the host , and hurried from the room . "
676454	676474	676451	676452	Signor Bazzano	1532	" whispered our hero , who had started from his seat at the sound of the traveller 's voice . "
676480	676497	676477	676478	Signor Markham	1533	" said the young aide - de - camp , shaking him kindly by the hand . "
676558	676738	676547	676547	my	0	" At that moment the host re - appeared with the gold and silver in change for the note ; and Bazzano , having hastily consigned the money to his pocket , hurried from the room,—but not before he had darted a significant glance upon our hero . In a few moments the post - chaise drove rapidly away . Richard returned to his seat in a cruel state of uncertainty , doubt , and suspense . What could that precipitate journey mean ? was Bazzano the sole occupant of the carriage ? what terrible events could have occurred at Montoni ? and what was that fearful peril which would oblige him to adopt so painful a precaution as to separate from his companion ? Richard was at a total loss how to solve these queries which naturally suggested themselves to his mind . While he was yet pondering on the singularity of the incidents which had occurred , all within the space of three or four minutes , the company poured back again to the coffee - room . "
676743	676747	676547	676547	my	0	" said one . "
676760	676764	676547	676547	my	0	" observed another . "

676804	676814	676799	676799	he	18250	" demanded the speaker , turning abruptly towards Markham ; "
676825	676826	676827	676827	He	18250	" "
676841	676847	676839	676839	sir	26649	" answered our hero laconically . "

676906	676923	676884	676889	The tall man in the cloak	18258	" observed another of the company . Richard smiled imperceptibly ; for he thought within himself , "
676950	677015	676942	676943	the travellers	42662	" The company continued to debate , as all gossips will , upon the incident which had just occurred ; and Richard determined to lose no more time ere he explained to Morcar , who had of course recognised the young aide - de - camp , the nature of the warning he had received from this individual . He according bade the assembled guests "
677019	677065	676942	676943	the travellers	42662	" and left the room , followed by Morcar . At his request , the landlord conducted them to a double - bedded room ; and the moment the host had retired , Richard communicated to the gipsy all that Bazzano had said to him . "
677076	677080	677074	677074	sir	26649	" exclaimed Morcar . "
677085	677089	677074	677074	sir	26649	" asked Richard . "

677326	677330	677299	677299	Morcar	1364	" continued Richard , "

677382	677386	677375	677375	I	0	" exclaimed Morcar : "

677464	677473	677462	677462	Morcar	1364	" demanded Richard , surveying him with astonishment . "
677485	677489	677462	677462	Morcar	1364	" replied Morcar ; "
677498	677499	677462	677462	Morcar	1364	" "
677505	677550	677462	677462	Morcar	1364	" exclaimed Richard , struck by the truth of the observation , and well - pleased at the idea that his faithful dependant would indeed derive no small benefit , under circumstances , from the aid of that extensive and mysterious freemasonry to which he belonged,—"on
677686	677687	677671	677672	that functionary	4633	" "
677697	677701	677688	677688	I	0	" said Morcar . "
677709	677714	677715	677715	I	0	" continued our hero , "

677791	677795	677796	677796	You	26649	" replied Morcar . "

677861	677865	677859	677859	Morcar	1364	" said Richard . "

677914	677924	677905	677905	him	18296	" added Morcar , seeing that our hero hesitated . "
677970	677971	677947	677947	your	26649	" "
677980	677990	677947	677947	your	26649	" interrupted Markham , pressing the gipsy 's hand ; "
677996	678124	678125	678126	Generous man	36200	" And they each dashed away the tears from their eyes . Richard then divided the contents of his purse into two equal portions , and presented one to Morcar . The gipsy positively refused to accept any thing beyond a few pieces of gold ; but Markham was more positive still , and compelled him to assent to the equitable partition of the large sum which Eliza 's bounty had supplied . They then retired to rest . At day - break Markham started up ; but he looked in vain for Morcar . On the table stood a pile of gold : it was the one which our hero had forced upon the gipsy;—and only two of the pieces had been taken from the heap . "
678128	678132	678125	678126	Generous man	36200	" cried Markham : "
678153	678564	678133	678133	God	880	" Having hastily dressed himself , our hero concealed about his person the few necessaries that were indispensable , and left the remainder in his valise . He then descended to the coffee - room , hurried over a slight refreshment , and , having settled the account , took his departure , telling the landlord to keep the valise for him until his return . But now how lonely , forlorn , and friendless did he feel , as he hurried away from the inn where he had parted with his faithful dependant ! Richard Markham struck into the fields , and pursued his way in a southerly direction . He avoided even the small hamlets , and kept as much as possible in the open country . Being unaware of the precise nature of the danger which menaced his life,—although of course connecting it with the part which he had recently played in the invasion,—he feared lest printed descriptions of his person , with rewards for his apprehension , might be circulated ; and this source of terror induced him to choose the most secluded paths . It was long after sunset when he stopped at a small country public - house , where he determined to rest for the night . To his great joy the coffee - room was unoccupied by other travellers ; and the landlord appeared a simple , honest kind of half - farmer , half - publican , who never troubled himself about any one 's business save his own . A good supper and a bottle of very excellent wine tended to raise our hero 's spirits : and when the meal was concluded , he fell into a train of meditation on the events of the preceding evening . A thousand times did he ask himself who could be the occupant of that chaise which was journeying in such haste ? for that there was some person inside the vehicle , who had urgent reasons for the utmost circumspection , the fact of the drawn blinds would not permit him to doubt . Moreover , the young aide - de - camp was evidently riding outside for the purpose of answering any questions that might be put , paying the bills , directing the postillions , and in all respects acting with a view to save the person or persons inside from the necessity of giving their own orders . The words—"Terrible
678569	678725	678728	678728	landlord	27071	Montoni"—were also fraught with a most menacing and mysterious importance . What could they mean ? whom had these events endangered ? Was it possible that the kindness of the Grand Duchess towards himself had been detected ? And if so , what results could such a discovery have produced ? While he was thus lost in the most painful conjectures , a horseman suddenly galloped up to the door of the inn ; and in a few moments the traveller himself entered the coffee - room . He was a slightly - built , middle - aged man , with a good - humoured expression of countenance . He was attired in a kind of undress cavalry uniform , consisting of a foraging - cap with a broad gold band , a laced jacket , trousers with a red stripe down each leg , and a very small black leathern knapsack at his back . "
678730	678749	678728	678728	landlord	27071	" he exclaimed , as he entered the room , followed by the individual whom he thus addressed , "
678785	678817	678728	678728	landlord	27071	" The landlord bustled about to serve up the best his house could afford in such haste ; and in the meantime the new - comer addressed himself to our hero . "
678825	678829	678823	678823	sir	26649	" he said . "
678849	678856	678832	678832	you	26649	" returned Richard with a smile . "
678872	678877	678867	678867	I	0	" observed the man . "
678892	678896	678882	678882	you	26649	" he added : "
678923	678924	678925	678925	You	26649	" "
678930	678934	678925	678925	You	26649	" answered Richard . "
678943	678944	678936	678936	you	26649	" "
678982	678983	678925	678925	You	26649	" "
678991	679009	678925	678925	You	26649	" asked Richard , scarcely able to conceal the anxiety with which he waited for a reply . "
679013	679018	679019	679021	The Grand Duchess	10107	" was the answer . "
679025	679026	679019	679021	The Grand Duchess	10107	" "
679029	679033	679019	679021	The Grand Duchess	10107	" ejaculated Markham . "
679052	679057	679041	679042	no one	26771	" continued the courier . "
679154	679166	679152	679152	sir	26649	" added the courier , sinking his voice to a whisper , "
679208	680569	679199	679199	I	0	" At that moment the landlord entered with a tray containing the courier 's supper ; and the conversation ceased . Nor had our hero an opportunity of reviving it ; for the courier was too busily engaged with his knife and fork to utter a word during his meal ; and the moment it was terminated , he wished Markham good night and took his departure . Still our hero had gleaned enough to afford him some clue to the mystery of the post - chaise . The Grand Duchess had fled : the reason of her flight was not publicly known . Was it not probable that she was an occupant of the post - chaise which journeyed so swiftly ? did not this idea receive confirmation from the fact that Mario Bazzano accompanied the vehicle ? Then again occurred the question , had the Grand Duchess involved herself in difficulty by her generosity towards him ? The bare supposition of such an occurrence was the source of the most poignant anguish in the breast of Richard Markham . He retired to rest ; but his sleep was uneasy ; and he awoke at an early hour , little refreshed . He was however compelled to pursue his melancholy journey , which he resumed with a heavy heart and with a mind oppressed by a thousand vague apprehensions . There was one circumstance which especially afflicted him . He had not dared to write a letter to Isabella ; and he knew that the tidings of the failure of the invasion would shortly reach her . Then what must be her feelings ! She would believe that he had either fallen in the conflict , or was a prisoner in some Castelcicalan fortress ; and he entertained so profound a conviction of her love for him,—a love as sincere as that which he experienced for her,—that he dreaded the effects which would be produced upon her by the most painful uncertainty or the worst apprehensions concerning his fate . Still , how could he write to her with any hope that the letter would reach her ? In the existing condition of Castelcicala , he felt persuaded that all correspondence addressed to Prince Alberto or any member of his family , would be intercepted . This conviction had hitherto prevented him from addressing a word to that charming girl whose image was ever present to his mind . But as he journeyed wearily along , it suddenly struck him that he might write to Whittingham , and enclose a note for Isabella . Besides , he was also anxious to acquaint that faithful servant , as well as Mr. Monroe and Ellen , with the hopes that he entertained of being shortly enabled to return to his native land . He accordingly resolved to put this project into execution . For that purpose he was compelled to pass the next night at a town where there was a post - office . He wrote his letters in the most guarded manner , and omitted the signature . When they were safely consigned to the letter - box , he felt as if a considerable load had been taken off his mind . At this town he gleaned a great deal of information concerning the agitated condition of the country . Martial law had been proclaimed in every province ; and the worst fears existed as to the Grand Duke 's ulterior views . The idea of Austrian intervention appeared to be general ; and deep , though not loud , were the curses which were levelled against the policy of that sovereign who could venture to call in a foreign soldiery to rivet the shackles of slavery which he had imposed upon his subjects . One circumstance peculiarly struck our hero : the Grand Duke seemed to possess no supporters — no apologists . The hatred excited by his tyranny was universal . Castelcicala only required a champion to stand forward — a leader to proclaim the cause of liberty — and Richard felt convinced that the whole nation would rise as one man against the despot . That the Grand Duchess had fled precipitately from Montoni , was a fact now well known ; but the motives and details of her departure were still veiled in the most profound mystery . There was another circumstance which forced itself on Markham 's observation : this was that the deepest sympathy existed in behalf of the prisoners who had been taken in the conflict near Ossore , and who , it seemed , had all been despatched to the fortress of Estella . Richard 's prowess in rallying the troops also appeared to be well known ; and on more occasions than one , during his wanderings in Castelcicala , did he find himself the object of the most flattering discourse , while those who eulogised him little suspected that the hero of their panegyric was so near . But it is not our intention to follow him through those wanderings . Suffice it to say that he found his journey more wearisome than he had anticipated ; and that he was frequently compelled to avail himself of a carrier 's van along the by - roads , or to hire a horse , in order to diminish the fatigues of his wayfaring . It was on the twelfth evening after he left Friuli , where he had parted with Morcar , that he crossed the river Usiglio at a ferry about four miles to the east of Pinalla . He was now only forty miles from the Neapolitan frontier ; and in twenty - four hours more he fondly hoped to be beyond the reach of danger . He had partaken of but little refreshment during that day , for the nearer he approached the point where peril would cease and safety begin , the more anxious did he become . Having crossed the ferry , he inquired of the boatman the way to the nearest inn . A dreary by - lane was pointed out to him , with an intimation that it would lead to a small public - house , at the distance of about a mile . Richard pursued his way , and had proceeded about three hundred yards down the lane , which was shaded on either side by large chesnut - trees , when several individuals rushed upon him so suddenly that he had no time to offer any effectual resistance . He , however , struggled desperately , as two of the banditti ( for such his assailants were ) attempted to bind his arms with cords . But his endeavours to free himself from their grasp were vain and fruitless , and only provoked a rougher treatment at their hands ; for one of the banditti drew a pistol from his belt , and with the butt - end of the weapon aimed a desperate blow at our hero 's head . Richard fell , bleeding and insensible , upon the ground . When he opened his eyes again , he found himself lying in a comfortable bed . Putting aside the damask - silk curtains , he glanced anxiously around the room , which was sumptuously furnished . He fell back on his pillow , and strove to collect his scattered ideas . His head pained him : he raised his hand to his forehead , and found that it was bandaged . Then the attack of the banditti in the dark lane flashed across his mind ; and he mechanically thrust his hand into his bosom . Alas ! Armstrong 's letter was gone ! We must now direct our readers ' attention for a short space to the parlour of the Boozing - Ken on Saffron Hill . It was nine o'clock in the evening ; and , as usual , a motley company was assembled in that place . A dozen persons , men and women , were drinking the vile compounds which the landlord dispensed as "

He occasionally glanced towards the clock as if he were expecting some one ; and then an impatient but subdued curse rose to his lips , proving that the individual for whom he waited was behind his time .

His denunciation of the abominable system of doctoring wines , spirits , and malt liquors produced a gloomy effect upon the company whom he left behind . The Buffer glanced often and often towards the clock : the time was passing rapidly ; and yet the person for whom he was waiting came not . "

683095	683124	683125	683125	Brayvo	1580	" And in another minute the parlour of the boozing - ken reverberated with the intonations of the following strange song : — THE MAN OF MANY PURSUITS . "

Scarcely had the applause , which greeted this song , terminated , when the door opened , and Lafleur , Mr. Greenwood 's French valet , entered the room . He was disguised in a large rough coat and slouched hat ; but the Buffer immediately recognised his countenance , and hurried to meet him . "

684734	684806	684807	684809	My dear fellow	26700	" repeated Lafleur impatiently . Before the Buffer could answer the question , the door was thrown open , and the Resurrection Man entered the room . Anthony Tidkins was dressed in a most miserable manner ; and his whole appearance denoted poverty and privation . He was thin and emaciated ; his eyes were sunken ; his cheeks hollow ; and his entire countenance more cadaverous and ghastly than ever . "
684811	684822	684807	684809	My dear fellow	26700	" cried the Buffer , springing forward to meet him ; "

The hopes of obtaining a considerable sum of money animated the eyes of Tidkins with fire and his cadaverous countenance with a glow of fiendish satisfaction . He highly approved of the idea of engaging the Lully Prig and Long Bob in the enterprise ; for he entertained a good opinion of their courage , in spite of the affair of the plague - ship . Indeed , he could well understand the invincible nature of the panic - terror which had seized upon them on that occasion ; and , as he foresaw that their co - operation would be valuable in other matters , he was disposed to forget the past . In fine , all the preliminary arrangements were made with Lafleur , who presented the two villains each with a ten pound - note as an earnest of his sincerity , and then took his departure . When the Resurrection Man and the Buffer were alone together , they brewed themselves strong glasses of brandy and water , lighted their pipes , and naturally began to discourse on what had passed since they last saw each other . The Buffer related all that had occurred to him after his return to Mossop 's wharf,—how he had been pursued by the three men belonging to the Blossom,—how one turned out to be Richard Markham , another a policeman in disguise , and the third Morcar,—how they had vainly searched the Fairy to discover Anthony Tidkins,—and how he himself eventually sold the lighter .

688627	688633	688625	688625	Jack	1127	" inquired the Resurrection Man . "
688658	688663	688655	688655	you	0	" was the answer . "
688674	688680	688666	688666	I	0	" said the Resurrection Man ; "
688694	688789	688692	688692	you	0	" It was six o'clock on the evening following the incidents related in the two preceding chapters . Mr. Greenwood had just concluded an early dinner ( early for him ) after having devoted the greater part of the day to business in the City , and a small portion of it to his fair Georgian , for whom he had taken elegantly furnished apartments in Suffolk Street , Pall Mall . Having disposed of his last glass of champagne , the honourable member for Rottenborough rang the bell . Lafleur made his appearance . "
688798	688803	688806	688806	sir	26649	" inquired Mr. Greenwood . "
688813	688818	688811	688811	sir	26649	" answered the valet . "
688870	688871	688872	688872	I	0	" "
688879	688883	688872	688872	I	0	" replied Lafleur ; "

689025	689029	689030	689030	Her	18615	" said Lafleur . "

689082	689089	689077	689077	you	26649	" demanded Mr. Greenwood , sternly . "
689105	689106	689096	689096	I	0	" "
689150	689151	689154	689154	sir	26649	" "
689163	689167	689161	689161	sir	26649	" observed Lafleur . "
689189	689194	689184	689184	I	0	" continued Mr. Greenwood . "
689199	689203	689184	689184	I	0	" responded Lafleur . "
689222	689227	689205	689205	I	0	" added Mr. Greenwood . "
689232	689236	689230	689230	sir	26649	" observed Lafleur . "
689257	689265	689244	689244	you	26649	" The valet answered in the affirmative . "
689390	689391	689394	689394	sir	26649	" "
689400	689405	689394	689394	sir	26649	" observed the valet . "
689415	689420	689394	689394	sir	26649	" continued Mr. Greenwood . "
689471	689472	689452	689456	a woman singing a ballad	18643	" "
689479	689484	689474	689474	your	26649	" said the valet : "
689493	689494	689488	689491	the muffin - boy	18646	" "
689501	689511	689488	689491	the muffin - boy	18646	" observed Mr. Greenwood , rising from his seat . "
689523	689524	689520	689520	you	0	" "
689529	689530	689527	689527	sir	26649	" "
689592	689593	689554	689554	you	1064	" "
689598	689613	689554	689554	you	1064	" answered Lafleur , not a muscle of his countenance betraying any extraordinary emotion . "
689621	689625	689554	689554	you	1064	" said Greenwood ; "
689648	689649	689672	689672	you	26649	" "
689652	689670	689672	689672	you	26649	sir;"—and Lafleur was about to leave the room , when he suddenly recollected himself , and said , "
689708	689709	689706	689706	sir	26649	" "
689726	689734	689735	689736	The scoundrel	13697	" cried Mr. Greenwood , desperately excited . "
689850	689857	689858	689858	you	1064	" added Mr. Greenwood , solemnly , "
689885	689886	689889	689889	sir	26649	" "
689891	689982	689889	689889	sir	26649	" And Lafleur left the room . A few minutes afterwards Mr. Greenwood repaired to his study , where the lamp had already been placed upon the table . He then opened his iron safe , and drew forth a large canvass bag full of sovereigns . This he consigned to a tin box , resembling those in which lawyers keep their clients ' papers . Three more bags , of the same size as the first , were taken from the safe and stowed away in this japanned case . "
689987	689993	689889	689889	sir	26649	" murmured Greenwood to himself . "
690027	690037	690023	690023	I	0	" Mr. Greenwood , having thus complimented himself upon those "
690039	690089	690023	690023	I	0	" whereby he had gained his wealth , proceeded to take a large portfolio from the iron safe . Partially opening its various compartments , so as to obtain a glance at the contents , he smiled still more complacently than when his eyes lingered on the canvass bags . "
690099	690114	690023	690023	I	0	" he exclaimed aloud , as he consigned the portfolio to the tin case . "
690144	690171	690172	690172	My	0	" His really handsome countenance wore an expression of triumph , as he carefully locked the tin case , and placed the key in his pocket . "
690199	690201	690223	690224	the financier	30425	" continued Greenwood,—"now
690203	690209	690223	690224	the financier	30425	sum,"—and he glanced towards the tin box—"will
690305	690382	690293	690293	Pshaw	1324	" He ceased , and surveyed himself complacently in the mirror above the mantel . He then rang the bell . Lafleur appeared in about a minute ; but so calm , composed , and unruffled was his countenance , that no living soul would have suspected that he had been attentively listening at the door of the study all the while his master was transferring the treasure from the iron safe to the tin box . "
690394	690643	690392	690392	Lafleur	1064	" said Mr. Greenwood , not choosing to lose sight of his tin box . Lafleur once more disappeared , and speedily returned with his master 's travelling attire . He announced at the same time that the chaise was at the door . In a few minutes , Mr. Greenwood was ensconced in the vehicle . The tin box was stowed away under the seat : and his case of pistols lay by his side , within convenient reach . Filippo and Lafleur mounted the dickey : the postillions cracked their whips ; and the equipage rolled rapidly away from Spring Gardens . At half - past eight o'clock precisely the vehicle drove up to the door of the principal inn of which the town of Rottenborough could boast . The ostlers seemed to bungle in a very unusual manner , as they changed the horses ; and full five minutes elapsed ere they could loosen the traces . In a word , they punctually obeyed the directions of Mr. Greenwood 's agent in that famous town . Suddenly the door of the tap - room burst open and vomited forth about eighty of such queer and suspicious - looking fellows , that no prudent man would have walked down a dark lane where he knew any one of them to be lurking . Out they came — in most admirable disorder — pell - mell — jostling , hustling , pushing , larking with each other . "
690652	690666	690667	690667	Greenwood	903	" they shouted , at the tops of voices somewhat disguised in liquor . "
690676	690677	690673	690674	the Tories	18677	" "
690682	690704	690673	690674	the Tories	18677	" shouted a little man , dressed in deep black , and who suddenly appeared at the head of the mob : "
690713	690714	690707	690708	the Liberals	32855	" "
690723	690736	690707	690708	the Liberals	32855	" cried the mob ; and then they shouted louder than ever , "
690751	690779	690746	690747	The Tories	1345	" Then the little man in black , who was none other than the honourable member 's agent , rushed up to the carriage window , exclaiming , "
690825	690841	690880	690880	Brayvo	1580	" added the lawyer , glancing round at the ragged and half - drunken mob , "
690878	690879	690880	690880	Brayvo	1580	" "
690884	690889	690890	690890	gentlemen	27077	" ejaculated the crowd of "
690892	690902	690903	690903	Gentlemen	27077	" when the little lawyer had concluded his speech . "
690905	690920	690903	690903	Gentlemen	27077	" said Mr. Greenwood , thrusting his head out of the chaise - window , "
691019	691020	691004	691004	Gentlemen	27077	" "
691032	691044	691004	691004	Gentlemen	27077	" cried one of the free and independent inhabitants of Rottenborough . "
691049	691064	691004	691004	Gentlemen	27077	" continued Greenwood , unabashed by this interruption , which raised a general titter ; "
691132	691376	691377	691377	I	0	" With this splendid finale , Mr. Greenwood sank back in the chaise , which immediately drove rapidly away , amidst the uproarious shouts of the ragamuffins and tatterdemalions whom the lawyer had convoked , according to Lafleur 's written instructions , for the occasion . The ragamuffins and tatterdemalions were , however , well recompensed for their trouble ; for they were copiously regaled with beer and tobacco before the arrival of the honourable member ; and as soon as the member had departed , a supper of boiled tripe and onion - sauce was served up to them . The entertainment concluded with a quarrel and battle amongst the convivialists , several of whom took home with them broken heads and black eyes as trophies of their prowess . Meantime the travelling - chaise rolled along the road . The night was beautiful , clear , and frosty ; and the moon rode high in the heavens . Newington was passed ; and Mr. Greenwood was just falling into a delicious sleep , when four men , wearing masks , and enveloped in thick pilot - coats , rushed from a hedge . The horses were stopped suddenly ; and two of the ruffians presented pistols at the heads of the postillions , menacing them with instant death if they offered any resistance . Greenwood lowered the windows of the chaise , and holding a pistol in each hand , exclaimed , "
691387	691846	691377	691377	I	0	" Filippo leapt to the ground on one side , and Lafleur followed him so closely , that he fell over the Italian , one of whose pistols went off by the shock , but without doing any mischief . Before he could make an effort to rise , Lafleur struck him on the head with the butt - end of one of his weapons , and laid him senseless on his back . Meantime , while the Lully Prig and Long Bob took charge of the postillions , as above stated , the Resurrection Man and the Buffer rushed up to the door of the chaise . Greenwood fired point - blank at Tidkins 's head but without the slightest effect . The door was opened ; and the Resurrection Man sprang into the vehicle . Greenwood fired his second pistol ; but it merely singed his assailant 's hair . Then the Member of Parliament was dragged into the road , and bound hand and foot almost in the twinkling of an eye . This being done , the Resurrection Man hastened to search the chaise , and speedily secured the tin box . He gave a long shrill whistle : this was a signal to announce his success ; for it had been previously agreed amongst the ruffians that they should not utter a word more than might be absolutely necessary , so that their voices might not be afterwards recognised , in case suspicion fell upon them . Moreover , the Resurrection Man 's voice was well known to Greenwood ; and thus this precaution was not an useless one . The four robbers and Lafleur now beat a rapid retreat towards an adjacent chalk - pit , the Buffer leading the way , and the Resurrection Man carrying the box . We left Richard Markham at the moment when , awaking in a strange bed , he perceived that Thomas Armstrong 's letter was gone ! It would be impossible to describe his grief at this discovery . The mysterious document , which he had treasured with so much care , and concerning which such particular instructions had been left by his departed friend,—a document which seemed so intimately to regard his future welfare,—had been wrested from him ! For a few moments he remained a prey to the deepest dejection ; and tears stole into his eyes . But he was not allowed to remain long in that unpleasant reverie . The door opened slowly ; and a light step approached his couch . He drew aside the curtain , and beheld a middle - aged lady , elegantly dressed , and with a countenance on which the Almighty had written the word "
691848	691886	691890	691891	Signor Markham	1533	" in characters so legible , that a savage might have read and learnt to revere them . Advancing close up to the bed , the lady said , in a soft tone , and in the Italian language:—"Be
691910	691911	691896	691908	those who will treat you as your dauntless valour and noble mind deserve	18702	" "
691918	691932	691916	691916	madam	26758	" asked our hero , reassured by the lady 's words and manner . "
691950	691955	691940	691941	Signor Viviani	1589	" answered the lady . "
691966	691970	691959	691959	you	0	" inquired Richard . "
691998	692003	691959	691959	you	0	" returned Signora Viviani . "
692021	692034	692008	692008	lady	8723	" exclaimed Markham , new life as it were animating his soul . "
692037	692051	692075	692075	Signora	1590	" cried the banker 's sister , placing her finger upon her lip : "
692070	692071	692062	692062	You	0	" "
692082	692083	692062	692062	You	0	" "
692087	692092	692093	692093	You	0	" was the reply . "
692098	692099	692093	692093	You	0	" "
692103	692107	692093	692093	You	0	" ejaculated Richard . "
692123	692124	692125	692125	Morcar	1364	" "
692137	692142	692135	692135	Signor	1589	" said the lady . "
692173	692174	692177	692177	lady	8723	" "
692204	692218	692219	692219	You	0	" said Markham , pressing the lady 's hand respectfully to his lips . "
692233	692249	692219	692219	You	0	" observed the banker 's sister , with a mysterious but good - natured smile . "
692277	692278	692268	692269	Thomas Armstrong	882	" "
692283	692293	692268	692269	Thomas Armstrong	882	" cried Markham , overjoyed at such welcome intelligence . "
692302	692303	692295	692295	Providence	878	" "
692316	692321	692304	692304	I	0	" said the lady . "
692337	692369	692331	692331	he	2172	" Signora Viviani left the room , and shortly returned , accompanied by a gentleman of about sixty , and whose countenance was as expressive of excellent qualities as her own . "
692377	692386	692387	692388	a patient	34192	" said the lady , with a smile : "
692418	692419	692420	692420	I	0	" "
692442	692457	692460	692461	a friend	26800	" exclaimed the banker , pressing both Markham 's hands cordially in his own ; "
692468	692474	692463	692463	I	0	" added the excellent man . "
692488	692498	692499	692499	Your	0	" asked Richard , overpowered by so much goodness . "
692523	692528	692530	692530	he	882	" answered the banker ; "
692661	692662	692653	692653	you	0	" "
692678	692682	692683	692683	I	0	" said Richard . "
692731	692732	692726	692729	selfish or insane adventurers	18735	" "
692737	692741	692726	692729	selfish or insane adventurers	18735	" ejaculated Viviani . "
692781	692802	692778	692779	Richard Markham	874	" The countenance of our hero became animated with a glow of generous enthusiasm as these words met his ears . "
692808	692815	692778	692779	Richard Markham	874	" exclaimed the banker 's sister . "
692827	692832	692816	692818	An old woman	28871	" she added smiling ; "
692848	692849	692844	692844	she	1329	" "
692853	692866	692844	692844	she	1329	" ejaculated Richard , surprised at this allusion to that beautiful lady . "
692877	692886	692902	692902	he	1442	" said the banker 's sister , smiling , "
693108	693109	693110	693111	Excellent lady	18757	" "
693113	693117	693118	693118	you	18757	" cried Markham ; "
693156	693157	693158	693158	You	18757	" "
693171	693176	693177	693177	I	0	" said the banker . "
693670	693735	693659	693659	he	1364	" While the banker was yet speaking , he drew from his pocket the morocco case containing Armstrong 's letter , and laid it upon the bed . Richard warmly pressed his hand with grateful fervour . He then in a few words narrated the particulars of the attack made upon him by the banditti in the narrow lane , and concluded by saying , "
693777	693778	693763	693763	I	0	" "
693788	693823	693780	693780	you	0	" said the banker , with a smile . Richard was about to explain the nature of the mysterious instructions which Armstrong had written on the envelope , when Viviani stopped him , saying , "
693959	694007	694008	694008	My	0	" So astonished was Markham , while the banker recapitulated the very words of Armstrong 's mysterious instructions , that he could not utter a syllable until the excellent man had finished speaking ; and then he cried , in a tone of the most unfeigned surprise , "
694018	694039	694012	694012	you	26679	" Signora Viviani laughed so heartily at Markham 's astonishment , that her good - natured countenance became quite purple . "
694047	694055	694042	694042	I	0	" exclaimed the banker , laughing also ; "
694185	694186	694289	694289	I	0	" "
694209	694213	694214	694214	I	0	" said Richard . "
694223	694286	694214	694214	I	0	" Again did the good banker and his merry sister — who , though bachelor and spinster , possessed hearts overflowing with the milk of human kindness , and who felt towards Richard almost as a father and mother would feel towards their own child,—again did they laugh heartily ; until the lady remembered that their patient might be too much excited . "
694300	694305	694298	694298	Morcar	1364	" said the banker . "
694425	694426	694408	694408	He	1364	" "
694433	694442	694443	694443	he	1364	" added the banker 's sister , laughing , "
694514	694515	694512	694512	himself	1364	" "
694522	694539	694512	694512	himself	1364	" cried Markham , tears standing on his long , dark , and slightly curled lashes . "
694552	694553	694554	694554	He	1364	" "
694560	694565	694554	694554	He	1364	" said the banker ; "
694602	694603	694589	694589	he	1364	" "
694616	694620	694604	694604	You	0	" said Richard ; "
694629	694630	694631	694631	You	0	" "
694638	694645	694631	694631	You	0	" exclaimed Signora Viviani , laughing . "
694669	694670	694631	694631	You	0	" "
694675	694680	694631	694631	You	0	" returned our hero . "

694702	694707	694631	694631	You	0	" said the banker . "
694726	694733	694736	694736	Richard	874	" The banker 's countenance fell . "
694738	694742	694736	694736	Richard	874	" he replied , "
694853	694854	694839	694839	it	18803	" "
694858	694862	694839	694839	it	18803	" ejaculated Richard : "
694871	694872	694839	694839	it	18803	" "
694886	694896	694882	694882	I	0	" continued the banker , in a melancholy tone . "
695083	695084	695066	695066	Richard	874	" "
695092	695117	695051	695052	Marshal Herbertstein	1592	" said Richard , astounded at all he had just heard , and at the rapidity with which so many important events had occurred . "
695136	695141	695128	695128	you	874	" continued the banker . "
695256	695257	695272	695272	they	18837	" "
695266	695270	695272	695272	they	18837	" asked Richard : "
695281	695282	695272	695272	they	18837	" "
695345	695528	695529	695529	I	0	" Signor Viviani was interrupted by the entrance of a servant , who came to announce that Morcar requested admittance to the sick - room . The kind - hearted banker and his no less excellent sister withdrew , in order to allow the gipsy an opportunity of free and unrestrained intercourse with his master . Nothing could exceed the joy which the faithful Morcar experienced on finding his master restored to consciousness , and evidently in a fair way towards convalescence . The reader may imagine with what enthusiasm the gipsy dwelt upon the kindness of Signor Viviani and his sister ; and when the grateful fellow had exhausted all his powers of speech in depicting the excellent qualities of these good people , he begged Markham to acquaint him with his adventures since they separated at Friuli . Richard related those particulars which are already known to the reader ; and he did not forget to reproach Morcar for having refused to accept his share of the purse at the tavern in the suburbs of the above - mentioned town . "
695541	695545	695532	695532	I	0	" answered Morcar ; "
695618	695619	695623	695623	you	0	" "
695632	695659	695623	695623	you	0	" asked Richard , with a good - natured smile at the solemn manner in which his follower had uttered the concluding portion of his observations . "
695670	695674	695660	695660	We	18855	" replied Morcar ; "
695847	695848	695842	695842	You	18862	" "
695856	695860	695842	695842	You	18862	" said Richard . "
695888	695889	695883	695884	Signor Viviani	1589	" "
695901	695905	695891	695891	I	0	" answered Morcar , "
695947	695948	695951	695953	my faithful friend	3596	" "
695955	695965	695969	695969	your	18862	" exclaimed Richard , taking the gipsy 's hand , "
696015	696016	696017	696017	You	0	" "
696028	696033	696017	696017	You	0	" said the gipsy . "
696054	696055	696045	696045	you	0	" "
696061	696072	696045	696045	you	0	" asked Richard , seeing that the gipsy checked himself . "
696085	696425	696426	696426	You	18874	" replied Morcar . Our hero saw that his dependant had some plan in his head ; but he did not choose to press him on the subject . A fortnight had elapsed since Richard Markham awoke to consciousness in the house of the generous Castelcicalan banker . This interval had produced a marvellous change in his physical condition . A powerful constitution , aided by excellent medical advice , and the unremitting attention of his kind friends , enabled him to triumph over the severity of the treatment which he had experienced at the hands of the banditti . He was now completely restored to health — with the exception of a partial weakness and pallor which naturally followed a long confinement to his couch . But by means of gentle exercise in the garden belonging to the banker 's house , he was rapidly recovering his strength , and the hues of youth again began to bloom upon his cheeks . It was on the 26th of December , 1840 , that he had a long conversation with the banker and Morcar . A certain project was the topic of this debate,—a project for which Morcar had arranged all the preliminaries during Richard 's illness , and which our hero now burned to carry into execution . Signor Viviani raised but one objection ; and that was only for the purpose of delaying , not renouncing , the scheme in view . He feared lest Markham 's health might not be sufficiently restored to enable him to embark so soon in the enterprise . But this doubt was completely over - ruled by his young friend , whose enthusiastic soul could not brook delay in a matter that was so near and dear to his heart . The deliberations of the three individuals who formed this solemn council lasted for four hours , and concluded at sunset . Richard then wrote several letters , which he sealed and placed in the hands of Signor Viviani , saying , "
696437	696449	696452	696453	my generous	18875	" The banker wrung our hero 's hand cordially , exclaiming , "
696491	696516	696544	696544	you	1533	" Signora Viviani entered the room at this moment , and in a tone of deep anxiety , inquired the result of the deliberation . "
696524	696531	696544	696544	you	1533	" replied the banker , solemnly . "
696537	696542	696544	696544	you	1533	" exclaimed the lady ; "
696579	696580	696581	696581	My	0	" "
696585	696593	696581	696581	My	0	" interrupted Richard , with a smile , "
696628	696629	696656	696656	God	880	" "
696647	696654	696656	696656	God	880	" said the banker 's sister . "
696662	696737	696656	696656	God	880	" The old lady wiped the tears from her eyes as she spoke . It was now quite dusk ; and our hero signified his intention of taking his departure . He confided the morocco case containing Armstrong 's letter , to his excellent friend , the banker , and at the same time expressed his deep gratitude for all the kindness he had experienced at the hands of that gentleman and his sister . "
696747	696753	696743	696745	my noble boy	18882	" ejaculated the old man ; "
696840	697220	697223	697226	four hundred brave men	18885	" Signora Viviani , on her side , felt as acutely in parting with our hero as if she were separating from a near relative — so much had his amiable qualities , generous disposition , and noble character endeared him alike to the banker and his kind - hearted sister . And now the door of that hospitable mansion closed behind Richard Markham , who was accompanied by his faithful Morcar . They pursued their way , the gipsy acting as the guide , through the streets of Pinalla , and passing out of the town by the north - eastern gate , followed the course of the river Usiglio for upwards of two miles and a - half . The night was clear with the pure lustre of the chaste moon ; and the air was mild , though fresh enough to be invigorating . At length they reached the confines of a forest , into which Morcar plunged , closely followed by his master . They now continued their way amidst an almost total darkness , so thick was the foliage of the evergreens through the mazes of which they pursued their course . Presently lights glimmered among the trees ; and in a few minutes more , Morcar conducted our hero into a wide open area , where a spacious gipsy - encampment was established . Markham caught his companion by the arm , and held him back for a few moments while he contemplated that scene so strange — so wild — and yet so picturesque . A space , probably an acre in extent , had been cleared in the midst of the forest ; and the tall trees all around constituted a natural barrier , defining the limits of the arena formed for the encampment . A hundred tents , of the rude gipsy fashion , swarmed with life . Dark countenances bent over the cheerful fires , above which mighty caldrons were simmering ; and the lurid light was reflected from dark eyes . The tall athletic forms of men and the graceful figures of women , were thrown out into strong relief by the lambent flames ; and the sounds of many voices fell in confused murmurs upon the ears . "
697238	697250	697223	697226	four hundred brave men	18885	" exclaimed Morcar , stretching forth his arm towards the encampment . "
697257	697276	697223	697226	four hundred brave men	18885	" cried Markham , all the enthusiasm of his soul aroused by the hopes which those words conveyed : "
697293	697294	697281	697281	you	18886	" "
697316	697320	697295	697295	My	0	" replied Morcar ; "
697369	697370	697388	697388	you	18886	" "
697382	697386	697388	697388	you	18886	" said Richard . "
697424	697425	697431	697431	sir	26649	" "
697433	697439	697431	697431	sir	26649	" returned Morcar , seriously . "
697494	697495	697484	697484	me	0	" "
697502	697506	697497	697498	the King	3366	" asked Richard . "
697543	698143	697528	697529	the chiefs	13883	" Morcar led our hero through the mazes of the encampment to a tent more conveniently contrived and spacious than the rest ; and as they passed along , the groups of Cingani surveyed Richard with curiosity and respect . They evidently divined who he was . In the tent to which Morcar conducted his master , three elderly men were seated upon mats , smoking their pipes , and discoursing gravely upon political affairs . They welcomed Richard with respectful warmth , and instantly assigned to him the place of honour at the upper end of the tent . A council was then held ; but as the results will explain the decision to which the members came , it is not necessary to detail the deliberations on this occasion . We must , however , observe that Markham accepted the responsible and difficult post of commandant of the entire force ; and he immediately handed over to the gipsies an amount in bank - notes equivalent to a thousand pounds , for the purpose of reimbursing the outlay already effected by the Cingani chiefs , and of supplying an advance of pay to all the members of the band . At about eleven o'clock the fires were all extinguished throughout the encampment ; and , sentinels having been posted at short intervals round the open space , those who were not on duty laid down to rest . At day - break the scene was once more all bustle and life : the morning meal was hastily disposed of ; and Richard then issued the necessary orders for breaking up the encampment . It was arranged that the men who bore arms should proceed by forced marches towards Estella ; while the women and children might follow at their own pace . The farewells between husbands and wives , brothers and sisters , fathers and children , sons and mothers , took place in silence , but in profound sincerity ; and the corps , consisting of four hundred men , all well armed with muskets and cutlasses , and some few with axes also , was soon in motion amidst the dense mazes of the forest . Markham , with a sword by his side and a pair of pistols in the breast of his coat , advanced in front of the column , attended by the three chiefs and Morcar . It was at day - break on the 29th of December , that the sentinels posted on the southern bastion of the citadel of Estella , observed a small but compact body of men suddenly emerge from the forest which stretches along the Usiglio , from the neighbourhood of Pinalla almost up to the very walls of Estella . An alarm was given throughout the citadel ; for the beams of the rising sun glistened on the weapons of the small force that was approaching ; and although no uniform attire characterised the corps , it was easy to perceive that it advanced with a hostile intention . But ere the garrison could be got under arms , Richard 's followers had already cut an opening in the palisades which protected the glacis , and were advancing up the inclined plane towards the rampart . On they went , their youthful leader at their head : the glacis was passed — the covered way was gained — and then the sentinels on the bastion discharged their muskets at the besiegers . Two of the Cingani fell dead , and one was very slightly wounded . "
698147	698407	698145	698145	me	0	" cried our hero ; and rushing along the covered way , he reached the wooden bridge which communicated with the interior of the citadel . And now commenced an interval of fearful peril , but for which Markham was not unprepared . The soldiers of the garrison had by this time flocked to the rampart of the bastion , and commenced a terrific fire upon the besiegers . The latter , however , replied to it with rapidity and effect , while half a dozen of the foremost cut down with their axes a huge beam from the wooden bridge , and , under the superintendence of Markham , used it as a battering - ram at the postern - gate . The Cingani , however , lost eight or nine of their men while this task was in progress ; and their position , exposed as they were to a murderous fire , would soon have become untenable , had not the postern - gate shortly yielded to the engine employed against it . Then , with his drawn sword in his hand , Markham precipitated himself into the citadel , closely followed , and well supported by the brave and faithful Cingani . The tunnel beneath the rampart , into which the postern opened , was disputed for some minutes with desperate valour on both sides ; but our hero was so ably backed by Morcar , the three chiefs , and the foremost of his corps , that he eventually drove the soldiers before him . "
698414	698520	698521	698521	Friends	26675	" shouted Richard , as he rushed onward , and entered the court of the citadel . The cry was taken up by the Cingani ; and although the conflict continued in the court for nearly half an hour longer , it was evident that the note of liberty had touched a chord in the hearts of the Castelcicalan soldiers , for they resisted but feebly and , though superior in numbers to the besiegers , rapidly gave way . On the farther side of the court stood a large but low and straggling building , the windows of which were defended with iron bars . "
698523	698538	698521	698521	Friends	26675	" exclaimed Markham , pointing with his blood - stained sword towards that structure , "
698547	698655	698656	698656	Markham	874	" These words operated like an electric shock upon our hero 's followers ; and they rushed onward , driving the soldiers like chaff before them . The gate of the prison was reached , and speedily forced : Richard entered the gloomy stronghold , and the work of liberation commenced . Five hundred Castelcicalan patriots were restored to freedom in a short half - hour ; and when they recognised in their deliverer him who had been one of the chiefs of the first expedition , and whose valour was so signalised in the battle near Ossore , their enthusiasm knew no bounds . The name of "
698657	698982	698656	698656	Markham	874	" was shouted to the sky : the patriots flocked around him , with heart - felt thanks and the most fervent outpourings of their gratitude ; and they hailed him as a deliverer and a chief . There was not , however , much time for congratulation or explanation . Though the garrison of the citadel was weak , that of the town itself was strong ; for the Captain - General had concentrated the greater part of his force in the heart of Estella in order to over - awe the inhabitants . This fact had been previously gleaned by the spies whom Morcar had sent out while Richard was yet an inmate of the banker 's house ; and hence the attack upon the most exposed part of the citadel in preference to an attempt upon the town . Richard was now master of the citadel . A portion of the garrison had fled into Estella ; but by far the larger part , about three hundred in number , declared its readiness to join the cause of liberty . This offer was joyfully accepted . The armoury was then visited , and arms were distributed to the patriots who had been delivered from their dungeons . Thus Richard Markham found himself at the head of an effective force of nearly twelve hundred men — a triumphant position , which had fortunately cost no more than about twenty lives on the side of the Cingani . It was now mid - day ; and while his forces were obtaining refreshment , and putting the citadel in a proper state of defence , in case of an attack on the part of the Captain - General of Estella , Richard called a council of the three Cingani chiefs , Morcar , the leading patriots whom he had released , and the officers of the garrison - troops that had declared in favour of "
698989	699445	698656	698656	Markham	874	" At this council it was resolved that Richard should issue a proclamation to the inhabitants of Estella , declaring the real objects for which the standard of civil liberty had been raised — namely , to release the imprisoned patriots , to expel the Austrians from the land , and to place Prince Alberto upon the ducal throne . This resolution was carried into effect ; and the document was forwarded to the Mayor of Estella . The corporation was immediately assembled ; and while the Captain - General prepared to attack the citadel , the municipal body remained in close deliberation . Three hours elapsed ; when a rumour prevailed throughout the town that the troops had refused to leave their barracks at the command of the Captain - General . This proof of sympathy with the successful Constitutionalists decided the opinions of the members of the corporation ; and the Mayor , attended by several of the municipal authorities , waited upon Richard Markham and presented him with the keys of the city . No sooner were these tidings bruited throughout Estella , than the Captain - General , the Political Prefect , and one regiment which remained faithful to the Grand Duke 's cause , left the town with extraordinary precipitation : the remainder of the garrison sent a deputation to Markham 's head quarters in the citadel to announce their readiness to join his cause ; and at seven o'clock in the evening of that eventful day the roar of the artillery on the walls of Estella saluted the tri - coloured flag of liberty which was hoisted on the Town - Hall . By this grand and decisive blow , Richard possessed himself of one of the principal towns of Castelcicala , and found himself backed by a force of three thousand men . His first care , when order and tranquillity were restored that evening , was to forward a courier with a letter to Signor Viviani at Pinalla . That letter not only detailed the events of the day , but contained a request that the banker would lose no time in writing an account of the proceedings direct to Prince Alberto ( under the name of Count Alteroni ) in England . Richard also enclosed a letter to be forwarded to Mr. Monroe , and one from Morcar to Eva . The corporation had assembled in the Town Hall , immediately after the tri - coloured flag was hoisted , and remained in deliberation until past ten o'clock . The Mayor then published a proclamation in which there were three clauses . The first declared the sittings of the municipal body permanent , under the title of "
699455	699836	699837	699837	Gentlemen	27077	" The second nominated Richard Markham General - in - chief of the army of that province . The third called upon all good and faithful Castelcicalan patriots to take up arms in the cause of Constitutional liberty and Prince Alberto , and against the Austrian army of occupation . A copy of this proclamation was forwarded to Richard Markham , who highly approved of the first and last clauses , and accepted the rank conferred upon him by the second . Early on the following morning uniforms , taken from the store - rooms in the arsenal , were distributed amongst the Cingani and the patriots who had been liberated ; and Richard then made his entry into Estella , in compliance with the request of the corporation . Wearing the uniform of a General - officer , and mounted upon a handsome charger , our hero never appeared to greater advantage . The garrison of the town lined the streets , and presented arms to the youthful commander whose extraordinary skill and prowess had so materially contributed to the victory of the preceding day , and who was hailed as a champion raised up by Providence to deliver Castelcicala from the tyranny under which it groaned . He was attended by two officers whom he had appointed his aides - de - camp , and by the faithful Morcar , whom nothing could induce to accept any definite rank , but who , in the uniform of a private , was proud to follow his valiant master . The windows were crowded with faces , anxious to obtain a glimpse of the youthful hero ; and while bright eyes shone upon his way , fair hands waved handkerchiefs or threw nosegays of exotics and artificial flowers from the casements . The bells rang merrily ; the artillery saluted the entrance of the General into the town ; the crowds in the streets welcomed him with enthusiastic shouts ; and the civic authorities , in their official robes , received him as he alighted at the Town - Hall . There he was complimented on his gallant deeds , and invited to partake of a sumptuous banquet in the evening . But Richard 's answer was firm though respectful . "
699839	699843	699837	699837	Gentlemen	27077	" he said , "
699962	699978	699981	699981	sir	26649	" This short but pithy speech was received with enthusiastic cheers by the municipal body . "
699983	699995	699981	699981	sir	26649	" said the Mayor , when silence was obtained once more , "
700065	700932	700055	700055	you	26649	" Markham bowed , and withdrew . His return to the citadel was a signal for the renewal of that enthusiasm which had greeted his entrance into the town . But he was not proud ! No — he had no room in his heart for pride : hope — delicious , burning , joyous hope,—the hope of accomplishing his mighty aims and earning the hand of Isabella as his reward,—this was the only sentiment which filled his soul ! On his arrival at the citadel once more , he issued immediate orders to prepare for a march . He proposed to leave a garrison of one thousand men in Estella , and take two thousand with him ; for he calculated that this number would be considerably increased , by volunteers , on his way to Abrantani . The evident rapidity with which he intended his movements to be characterised , created a most favourable impression not only amongst the inhabitants of Estella , but also with the troops under his command ; and though they all deemed him eminently worthy of the post to which he had been raised , yet few foresaw the future greatness of that hero who was destined to take his place amongst the most brilliant warriors of the age . It was at two o'clock in the afternoon that the Constitutional army , consisting of two thousand men , defiled through the western gate of the citadel , towards the bridge over the Usiglio . A squadron of four hundred cavalry led the way : next came the corps of Cingani ; then the horse - artillery , with twelve field - pieces ; next the liberated patriots ; and the rear - guard consisted of the regular infantry of the garrison . As soon as the river was crossed , Richard formed his little army into three columns , and then commenced a rapid march towards Villabella , which he knew to be well affected in favour of the Constitutional cause . But while he was leading a gallant band over the fertile plains of Castelcicala , incidents deserving notice occurred in his native land far away . It was the 1st of January , 1841 . If there be any hour in the life of man when he ought to commune with his own heart , that proper interval of serious reflection is to be found on New Year 's Day . Then , to the rightly constituted mind , the regrets for the past will serve as finger - posts and guides to the hopes of the future . The heathen mythology depicted Janus with two faces , looking different ways:—so let the human heart , when on the first day of January , it stands between two years , retrospect carefully over the one that has gone , and combine all its solemn warnings for use and example in the new one which has just commenced . This also is the day that recalls , with additional impressiveness , the memory of those dear relatives and friends whose mortal forms have been swept away by the viewless and voiceless stream of Time . Nor less do fond parents think , amidst tears and prayers , of their sons who are absent in the far - off places of the earth,—fighting the battles of their country on the burning plains of India , or steering their way across the pathless solitudes of the ocean . But , alas ! little reck the wealthy and great for those whose arms defend them , or whose enterprise procures them all the bounties of the earth . An oligarchy has cramped the privileges and monopolised the rights of a mighty nation . Behold the effects of its infamous Poor - Laws;—contemplate the results of the more atrocious Game - Laws;—mark the consequences of the Corn - Laws . The Poor - Laws ! Not even did the ingenuity of the Spanish or Italian Inquisitions conceive a more effectual method of deliberate torture and slow death , than the fearful system of mental - abasement and gradient starvation invented by England 's legislators . When the labourer can toil for the rich no longer , away with him to the workhouse ! When the old man , who has contributed for half a century to the revenue of the country , is overtaken by sudden adversity at an age which paralyses his energies , away with him to the workhouse ! When the poor widow , whose sons have fallen in the ranks of battle or in defence of the wooden walls of England , is deprived of her natural supporters , away with her to the workhouse ! The workhouse is a social dung - heap on which the wealthy and great fling those members of the community whose services they can no longer render available to their selfish purposes . The Game - Laws ! Never was a more atrocious monopoly than that which reserves the use of certain birds of the air or animals of the earth to a small and exclusive class . The Almighty gave man "
700960	701406	700055	700055	you	26649	" and those who dare to monopolise any of these , to the prejudice of their fellow - creatures , fly in the face of the Lord of all ! The Game - Laws have fabricated an offence which fills our prisons — as if there were not already crimes enough to separate men from their families and plunge them into loathsome dungeons . That offence is one of human construction , and exists only in certain countries : it is not a crime against God — nor is it deemed such in many enlightened states . The selfish pleasures of a miserably small minority demand the protection of a statute which is a fertilising source of oppression , wretchedness , ruin , and demoralization . The Game - Laws are a rack whereon the aristocracy loves to behold its victims writhing in tortures , and where the sufferers are compelled to acknowledge as a heinous crime a deed which has in reality no moral turpitude associated with it . The Corn - Laws ! Were the Russian to boast of his freedom , Common Sense would point to Siberia and to the knout , and laugh in his face . When the Englishman vaunts the glory of his country 's institutions , that same Common Sense comes forward and throws the Corn - Laws in his teeth . What ! liberty in connexion with the vilest monopoly that ever mortal policy conceived ? Impossible ! England manufactures articles which all the civilised world requires ; and other states yield corn in an abundance that defies the possibility of home consumption . And yet an inhuman selfishness has declared that England shall not exchange her manufactures for that superfluous produce . No — the manufactures may decay in the warehouses here , and the grain abroad may be thrown to the swine , sooner than a miserable oligarchy will consent to abandon one single principle of its shameless monopoly . The Corn - Laws are a broom which sweeps all the grain on the threshing - floor into one corner for the use of the rich , but which leaves the chaff scattered every where about for the millions of poor to use as best they may . The aristocracy of England regards the patience of the masses as a bow whose powers of tension are unlimited : but the day must come , sooner or later , when those who thus dare to trifle with this generous elasticity will be struck down by the violence of the recoil . Although our legislators — trembling at what they affect to sneer at under the denomination of "
701410	701457	700055	700055	you	26649	intellect"—obstinately refuse to imitate enlightened France by instituting a system of national education,—nevertheless , the millions of this country are now instructing themselves ! Honour to the English mechanic — honour to the English operative : each alike seeks to taste of the tree of learning , "
701469	701905	700055	700055	you	26649	" Thank God , no despotism — no tyranny can arrest the progress of that mighty intellectual movement which is now perceptible amongst the industrious millions of these realms . And how excellent are the principles of that self - instruction which now tends to elevate the moral condition of the country . It is not confined within the narrow limits which churchmen would impose : it embraces the sciences — the arts — all subjects of practical utility,—its aim being to model the mind on the solid basis of Common Sense . To the millions thus enlightened , Religion will appear in all its purity , and the objects of Government in all their simplicity . The holy Christian worship will cease to be regarded as an apology for endowing a Church with enormous revenues ; and political administration must no longer be considered as a means of rendering a small portion of the community happy and prosperous to the utter prejudice of the vast remainder . There breathes not a finer specimen of the human race than a really enlightened and liberal - minded Englishman . But if he be deserving of admiration and applause , who has received his knowledge from the lips of a paid preceptor — how much more worthy of praise and respect is the self - instructed mechanic ! But to resume our narrative . It was the 1st of January , 1841 . The time - piece on the mantel in Mr. Greenwood 's study had just struck two in the afternoon . That gentleman himself was pacing the apartment in an agitated manner . His handsome dressing - gown of oriental pattern was not arranged , with the usual contrived air of negligence , to display the beautiful shirt - front , over which hung the gold chain of his Breguet - watch:—on the contrary , it had evidently been hurried on without the least regard to effect . The writing - table was heaped with a confused pile of letters and accounts — not thrown together for show , but lying in the actual disorder in which they had been tossed aside after a minute investigation . Though not absolutely slovenly in his present appearance , Mr. Greenwood had certainly neglected his toilet on that day ; and the state of his room moreover proved that he was too much absorbed in serious affairs to devote time to the minor considerations of neatness and the strict propriety of order . There was a cloud upon his brow ; and his manner was restless and unsettled . "
701914	701929	700055	700055	you	26649	" he exclaimed aloud , as he walked up and down with uneven steps . "
702135	702236	702237	702238	The villain	3773	" Mr. Greenwood ground his teeth with rage as he uttered these horrible maledictions . He did not , however , recall to mind that Lafleur was an honest man when he entered his service;—he did not pause to reflect upon all the intrigues , machinations , plots , duplicities , and villanies , in which he had employed his late valet,—thus gradually initiating him in those paths which could scarcely have led to any other result than the point in which they had actually terminated — the robbery of the master by the servant whom he had thus tutored . "
702240	702244	702237	702238	The villain	3773	" continued Greenwood . "
702299	702310	702272	702272	Filippo	1271	" He paused and glanced towards the time - piece . "
702341	702377	702380	702380	Tomlinson	1005	" And Greenwood 's countenance became as dark and lowering as the sky ere the explosion of the storm . In a few moments a double - knock at the door echoed through the house . "
702382	702414	702380	702380	Tomlinson	1005	" ejaculated Greenwood ; and with sovereign command over himself , he composed his features and assumed his wonted ease of manner . The stock - broker now entered the room . "
702425	702435	702415	702415	You	1005	" said Greenwood , shaking him by the hand . "
702442	702447	702436	702436	I	0	" was the answer : "
702455	702456	702448	702448	I	0	" "
702460	702472	702448	702448	I	0	" asked Greenwood , scarcely able to conceal his profound anxiety . "
702475	702479	702480	702480	You	1005	" replied Tomlinson . "
702593	702614	702615	702615	My	0	" This long speech enabled Greenwood to recover from the shock which the announcement of a new reverse had produced . "
702619	702623	702617	702617	Tomlinson	1005	" he said , "
702748	702749	702755	702755	you	0	" "
702760	702767	702755	702755	you	0	" inquired the stock - broker . "
702786	702790	702768	702768	You	1005	" continued Greenwood : "
702799	702800	702802	702802	I	0	" "
702805	702813	702802	702802	I	0	" observed the stock - broker bitterly . "
702820	702824	702825	702825	I	0	" exclaimed Greenwood . "
702849	702850	702831	702831	you	1005	" "
702855	702859	702851	702851	I	0	" returned Tomlinson . "
702875	702876	702870	702872	a great speculator	18941	" "
702887	702910	702883	702883	I	0	" added Greenwood , playing with his watch - chain in the easy complacent manner which had so characterised him until lately . "
702923	702933	702883	702883	I	0	" said Tomlinson , in his usual quiet way ; "
702945	702946	702954	702954	you	1005	" "
702957	702967	702954	702954	you	1005	" exclaimed Greenwood , with difficulty concealing his vexation . "
702998	702999	703000	703000	I	0	" "
703064	703065	703053	703053	I	0	" "
703068	703083	703053	703053	I	0	" ejaculated Greenwood : then , after a moment 's pause , he said , "
703100	703101	703085	703085	you	0	" "
703104	703117	703085	703085	you	0	" answered the stock - broker . Again Greenwood appeared to reflect . "
703121	703125	703085	703085	you	0	" he observed , "
703146	703147	703140	703140	I	0	" "
703154	703160	703148	703148	You	1005	" said Tomlinson , coolly . "
703267	703268	703269	703269	I	0	" "
703272	703276	703269	703269	I	0	" said Greenwood . "
703299	703300	703289	703289	you	0	" "
703304	703308	703289	703289	you	0	" returned Tomlinson ; "
703336	703337	703325	703325	I	0	" "
703342	703346	703325	703325	I	0	" cried Greenwood . "
703362	703363	703364	703364	I	0	" "
703369	703376	703364	703364	I	0	" said the stock - broker . "
703384	703385	703364	703364	I	0	" "
703389	703390	703364	703364	I	0	" "
703402	703406	703392	703394	your late cashier	18954	" inquired Greenwood . "
703420	703425	703392	703394	your late cashier	18954	" was the answer . "
703441	703442	703392	703394	your late cashier	18954	" "
703457	703461	703392	703394	your late cashier	18954	" said Greenwood . "
703487	703532	703480	703481	Van Diemen	1600	" Tomlinson turned away in disgust , and took his leave . Greenwood never moved from his seat until he heard the front door close behind the stock - broker . Then he started from his chair , and all his apparent composure vanished . "
703539	703558	703480	703481	Van Diemen	1600	" he exclaimed , in a hoarse , hollow tone , while he clenched his fists with rage . "
703633	703638	703640	703640	I	0	thousand!"—and he laughed wildly . "
703659	703671	703640	703640	I	0	" Then he paced the room in a singularly agitated manner . "
703685	703689	703680	703680	I	0	" he continued . "
703893	704038	704044	704044	myself	0	" Having thus buoyed himself up with those hopes which invariably urge on the gambler — whether at the actual gaming - table or in the public funds ( for there is little difference in a moral light between the two modes of speculation),—to put down fresh stakes on the chance aimed at , Greenwood recovered his wonted calmness . He busied himself in arranging his papers , and restoring neatness to his writing - table . Thus passed the time until six o'clock , when Filippo entered the room with a letter . It was from Tomlinson . Greenwood tore it open : the contents were favourable . The stock - broker 's friend had agreed to advance any sum up to twenty - five thousand pounds on the terms proposed , and had promised to observe the strictest secrecy in the transaction . "
704046	704050	704051	704051	Fortune	1147	" ejaculated Greenwood . "
704058	704224	704051	704051	Fortune	1147	" At nine o'clock on the same evening , Mr. Greenwood , muffled in a cloak , alighted from a hackney - cab in the Waterloo Road at the corner of the New Cut . That wide thoroughfare which connects the Waterloo and Blackfriars ' Roads , is one of the most busy and bustling , after its own fashion , in all London . Nowhere are the shops of a more miscellaneous nature : nowhere are the pathways so thronged with the stalls and baskets of itinerant venders . The ingenuity of those petty provision - dealers adapts the spoilt articles of the regular fishmongers and butchers to serviceable purposes in the free market of the New Cut . The fish is cut in slices and fried in an oil or butter whose rancid taste obviates the putrid flavour and smell of the comestible ; and the refuse scraps from the butchers shops are chopped up to form a species of sausage - balls called "
704227	704267	704051	704051	Fortune	1147	" Then the grease , in which the racy slices of fish and savoury compounds of lights and liver have been alike cooked , serves to fry large rounds of bread , which , when thus prepared , are denominated "
704273	704398	704051	704051	Fortune	1147	" Of course these culinary refinements are prepared by the venders in their own cellars or garrets hard by ; but when conveyed to the miscellaneous market in the New Cut , the luxuries impart a greasy and sickening odour to the air . It is perfectly wonderful to behold the various methods in which the poor creatures in that thoroughfare endeavour to obtain an honest livelihood ; and although their proceedings elicit a smile — still , God pity them ! they had better ply their strange trades thus than rob or beg ! There may be seen , for instance , a ragged urchin holding a bundle of onions in his hand , and shouting at the top of his shrill voice , "
704402	704431	704051	704051	Fortune	1147	ha'porth!"—and , no matter how finely dressed the passer - by , he is sure to thrust the onions under his or her very nose , still vociferating , "
704437	704572	704434	704435	a ha'porth	18961	" Poor boy ! he thinks every one must want onions ! The immediate vicinity of the Victoria Theatre is infested with women who offer play - bills for sale , and who seem to fancy it impossible that the passers - by can be going elsewhere than to the play . Here an orange - girl accosts a gentleman with two or three of the fruit in her hand , but with a significant look which gives the assurance that her real trade is of a less innocent nature:—there a poor woman with an array of children before her , offers lucifer matches , but silently appeals for alms . A little farther on is a long barrow covered with toys ; and a tall man without a nose , shouts at intervals , "
704583	704627	704434	704435	a ha'porth	18961	" Some of these gimcracks excite astonishment by their extreme cheapness ; but they are chiefly made by the convicts in Holland , and are exported in large quantities to England . In the middle of the road a man with stentorian voice offers "
704635	704648	704434	704435	a ha'porth	18961	" and , enumerating the list , he is sure to announce the "
704653	704711	704434	704435	a ha'porth	18961	" amongst the rest . Nearly opposite the Victoria Theatre there is an extensive cook's - shop ; and around the window stands a hungry crowd feasting their eyes on the massive joints which are intended to feast the stomach . In front of the butchers ' shops the serving - men keep up a perpetual vociferation of "
704714	704759	704434	704435	a ha'porth	18961	buy!"—a sort of running fire that denotes the earnestness with which competition is carried on amongst rivals in that delectable trade . Perhaps a new baker 's shop is opened in the New Cut ; and then a large placard at the window announces that "
704775	705037	704051	704051	Fortune	1147	" The buyers do not pause to reflect that the price of the cordial is deducted from the weight of the bread . The pawnbrokers ' shops seem to drive a most bustling trade in the New Cut ; and the fronts of their establishments present a more extensive and miscellaneous assortment of second - hand garments , blankets , handkerchiefs , and sheets , than is to be seen elsewhere . The influx and efflux of people at the public - houses and gin - shops constitute not the least remarkable feature of that neighbourhood , where every thing is dirty and squalid , yet where every one appears able to purchase intoxicating liquor ! On the southern side of the New Cut there are a great many second - hand furniture shops , the sheds wherein the articles are principally exposed being built against the houses in a fashion which gives the whole , when viewed by the glaring of the gas - lights , the appearance of a bazaar or fair . The New Cut is always crowded ; but the multitude is not entirely in motion . Knots of men congregate here , and groups of women there — the posts at the corners of the alleys and courts , or the doors of the gin - shops , being the most favourite points of such assembly . The edges of the pathways are not completely devoted to provision dealers . Penny peep - shows , emblazoned with a coloured drawing representing the last horrible murder,—itinerant quacks with "
705042	705344	704434	704435	a ha'porth	18961	toothache,"—stalls covered with odd numbers of cheap periodical publications,—old women seated on stools , behind little trays containing combs , papers of needles , reels of cotton , pack - thread , stay - laces , bobbin , and such - like articles,—men with cutlery to sell , and who flourish in their hands small knives with innumerable blades sticking out like the quills on a porcupine,—these are also prominent features in that strange market . In some conspicuous place most likely stands a caravan , surmounted by a picture representing a colossal giant and a giantess to match , with an assurance in large letters that the originals may be seen inside:—then , as the eye wanders from the enormous canvass to the caravan itself , and compares their sizes , the mind is left in a pleasing state of surprise how even one of the Brobdingnag marvels — let alone two — could possibly stow itself away in that diminutive box . Branching off from the New Cut , on either side , are numerous narrow streets,—or rather lanes , of a very equivocal reputation ; their chief characteristics being houses of ill - fame , gin - shops , beer - shops , marine - store dealers , pawnbrokers , and barbers ' establishments . There are two facts connected with low neighbourhoods which can not fail to attract the attention of even the most superficial observers in their wanderings amidst the mazes of the modern Babylon . The first is that the corner shops of nearly all the narrow and dirty streets are occupied by general dealers or people in the chandlery - line ; and the second is that all the barbers ' establishments are ornamented with a blind or placard conveying an assurance that each is "
705350	705466	704434	704435	a ha'porth	18961	" Here , again , the mind enjoys the excitement of uncertainty , as in the matter of the caravan and the giants ; for it is impossible to arrive at any satisfactory decision whether the aforesaid placard means you to infer that the shop to which it belongs was the first ever opened in the world for tonsorial purposes , or only the first that shed the light of its civilisation upon that especial neighbourhood . We may also observe that some of the proprietors of those establishments are not altogether unacquainted with the mysteries of puffing ; inasmuch as we frequently read upon their shop - fronts the truly exhilarating and inspiring words , "
705474	705854	704434	704435	a ha'porth	18961	" Such are the New Cut and its tributary lanes . And it was now along the New Cut that Mr. Greenwood , enveloped in his cloak , was pursuing his way . He scarcely noticed the turmoil , bustle , and business of that strange thoroughfare ; for he was too much absorbed in his own meditations . The truth was , that his affairs — once so gloriously prosperous — were now rendered desperate by various reverses ; and he was about to seek a desperate means of retrieving them . The reader can not have failed to observe that the characters of George Montague Greenwood and Richard Markham stand out from our picture of London Life in strong contrast with each other ; and it is not the less remarkable that while the former was rising rapidly to wealth , rank , and eminence , the latter was undergoing persecutions and sinking into comparative poverty . Now — at the epoch which we are describing — the tables seem to have turned ; for while George Montague Greenwood is about to seek a desperate remedy for his desperate affairs , Richard Markham is leading a gallant army over the fertile plains of Castelcicala . The former , then , may be deemed the personification of vice , the latter the representative of virtue . They had chosen separate paths:—the sequel will fully demonstrate which of the two characters had selected the right one . In the meantime we will continue our narrative . Mr. Greenwood pursued his way , and , having crossed over to the southern side of the New Cut , repaired to a small row of private houses of which this famous thoroughfare can boast at the extremity joining the Blackfriars ' Road . There he stopped for a moment beneath a lamp to consult a memorandum in his pocket - book ; and , having thereby refreshed his memory in respect to the address of which he was in search , he proceeded to knock at the door of a house close by . A dirty servant - girl opened it just as far as a chain inside would permit ; and protruding her smutty face , said , with strange abruptness , "
705861	705862	704434	704435	a ha'porth	18961	" "
705869	705873	705864	705865	Mr. Pennywhiffe	1602	" demanded Greenwood . "
705899	705912	705891	705891	I	0	" returned that most uninteresting specimen of the female - domestic race . "
705916	705922	705896	705896	your	1602	" exclaimed Greenwood , indignantly . "
705930	705931	705925	705925	you	0	" "
705937	705942	705934	705934	you	1602	" replied the girl . "
705950	705951	705954	705955	a execution	18966	" "
705961	705979	705954	705955	a execution	18966	" And , with these words , the girl banged the door in Mr. Greenwood 's face . "
705992	706016	705980	705980	I	0	" thought the Member of Parliament , as he turned away from the house , which was evidently in a state of siege . "
706022	706057	706058	706058	You	1602	" He then knocked at the door of the next house . A woman with a child in her arms answered the summons ; and , without waiting for any question , said abruptly , "
706064	706179	706058	706058	You	1602	" Greenwood entered accordingly , supposing that the woman had overheard his inquiry next door , and that he had now found the abode of the person whom he sought . The woman led the way into a back room , almost completely denuded of furniture , smelling awfully of tobacco - smoke , and very feebly lighted with a single candle that wanted snuffing . In the midst of a dense cloud of that vapour , a man without a coat was sitting on a trunk ; but the moment Greenwood entered , this individual threw down his clay - pipe , and advancing towards the visitor , exclaimed in a ferocious voice , "
706247	706265	706225	706225	I	0	" Thus speaking , the ferocious individual advanced towards Greenwood , squaring away like clock - work . "
706277	706284	706270	706270	you	26649	" exclaimed the Member of Parliament . "
706295	706296	706285	706285	I	0	" "
706304	706310	706285	706285	I	0	" demanded the pugilistic phenomenon . "
706317	706321	706322	706322	I	0	" said Greenwood . "
706325	706326	706322	706322	I	0	" "
706336	706341	706328	706328	you	26649	" exclaimed the man , "
706350	706351	706343	706343	you	26649	" "
706358	706368	706354	706354	I	0	" answered Greenwood , unable to suppress a smile . "
706378	706379	706372	706374	a Mr. Pennywhiffe	18971	" "
706388	706393	706381	706381	he	18971	" was the rejoinder . "
706420	706438	706381	706381	he	18971	" Greenwood turned indignantly away from the room , and left the house , muttering to himself , "
706455	706489	706491	706491	him	18971	" He was not , however , disheartened : it was highly necessary for him to see the person of whom he was in search ; and he accordingly knocked at another door . "
706502	706509	706492	706492	I	0	" shouted a masculine voice inside . "
706525	706735	706518	706518	he	18971	" Greenwood did not wait for the door to be opened ; he knew very well that Mr. Pennywhiffe could not live there . The fourth house at which he knocked was the right one . A decent - looking servant girl replied in the affirmative to his inquiry ; and he was forthwith conducted to a well - furnished room on the first floor , where he found Mr. Pennywhiffe seated at a table covered with papers . This individual was about fifty years of age . In person he was short , thin , and by no means prepossessing in countenance . His eyes were deeply set , grey , and restless ; and his forehead was contracted into a thousand wrinkles . He was dressed in a suit of black , and wore a white neckcloth — no doubt to enhance the respectability of his appearance . This was , however , a difficult task ; for had he figured in the dock of a criminal tribunal , the jury would have had no trouble in coming to a verdict , a more hang - dog countenance being seldom seen , even in a city where the face is so often the mirror of the mind . "
706741	706752	706738	706739	Mr. Greenwood	903	" exclaimed Mr. Pennywhiffe , rising to welcome his visitor ; "
706780	706781	706776	706777	no listeners	18978	" "
706792	706806	706776	706777	no listeners	18978	" answered Greenwood , taking a chair , and throwing back his cloak . "
706836	706837	706833	706834	Mr. Pennywhiffe	1602	" "
706842	706847	706833	706834	Mr. Pennywhiffe	1602	" asked that individual . "
706852	706856	706833	706834	Mr. Pennywhiffe	1602	" replied Greenwood . "
706864	706865	706866	706866	Decidedly	1603	" "
706882	706886	706868	706868	I	0	" exclaimed Greenwood . "
706897	706901	706887	706887	My	0	" observed Pennywhiffe ; "
706911	706912	706913	706913	I	0	" "
706930	706931	706927	706927	you	903	" "
706938	706942	706927	706927	you	903	" said Pennywhiffe . "
706952	706953	706927	706927	you	903	" "
706961	706977	706927	706927	you	903	" exclaimed the Member of Parliament , laying his pocket - book upon the table . "
706988	707030	706981	706981	I	0	" Mr. Pennywhiffe rose from his seat , and opening an iron safe , took thence a memorandum - book and a small tin box . Returning to his seat , he handed the memorandum - book to Greenwood , saying , "
707093	707332	707333	707333	I	0	" While Greenwood was employed in examining the memorandum - book , which contained upwards of five hundred names of peers , and great landowners , in addition to those of the chief commercial firms of London , Birmingham , Liverpool , Manchester , Leeds , Sheffield , Glasgow , and other places,—besides several belonging to Paris , Lyons , Bordeaux , Havre , and Lille ; Brussels , Amsterdam , Rotterdam , and Hamburgh ; New York , the West Indian Islands , and Montreal ; Calcutta , Bombay , and Madras;—while Mr. Greenwood , we say , was examining this strange register , and copying several of the best names of noblemen , gentlemen , and merchants , upon a slip of paper , Mr Pennywhiffe opened his tin - case . The contents thereof were numerous paid checks , and bills of exchange , respectively bearing the signatures of the persons or firms whose names were entered in the memorandum - book . How Mr. Pennywhiffe became possessed of such important documents,—which , seeing that they had all been duly honoured at maturity , ought to have remained in the hands of those who took them up,—was a mystery which he kept to himself . Whether he had collected them by degrees , or had obtained them in a heap by robbery , or any other means , he never condescended to acquaint his clients . "
707339	707343	707333	707333	I	0	" said Greenwood ; "
707382	707383	707333	707333	I	0	" "
707390	707393	707333	707333	I	0	" observed Mr. Pennywhiffe,—"an
707413	707414	707416	707416	you	0	" "
707427	707709	707419	707419	I	0	" Mr. Pennywhiffe once more had recourse to his iron safe , and returned to his seat with a small paste - board box , long and narrow , and containing a vast number of bill - stamps adapted to sums of all amounts . As the usual formula of such documents was printed ( though in various ways , they having been procured at different stationers ' shops ) the process of filling them up was by no means a tedious one . But now the ingenuity of Mr. Pennywhiffe mainly exhibited itself . Each bill was filled up with a different ink and a different pen ; and so skilful a caligrapher was he , that the most astute judge of writing could not possibly have perceived that they were all written by the same hand . Then , by the aid of red ink , a few flourishes , and little circles containing initial letters or figures as if each document corresponded with some particular entry in some particular leger or bill - book , the papers speedily assumed a very business - like appearance . And now the most difficult and delicate part of the entire process was to commence — the signatures . But Mr. Pennywhiffe went to work with the air of one who fully understood what he was about ; and with the originals before him as a copy , he perfected acceptance after acceptance in so masterly a manner , that Greenwood , when he compared the fictitious signatures with the genuine , was astounded at the caligraphic proficiency of that man whose dangerous agency he was now rendering available to his purposes . "
707717	707722	707419	707419	I	0	" said Mr. Pennywhiffe . "
707733	707737	707419	707419	I	0	" observed Greenwood . "
707742	707747	707419	707419	I	0	" demanded the caligrapher . "
707759	707760	707761	707761	I	0	" "
707765	707770	707761	707761	I	0	" returned Mr. Pennywhiffe ; "
707779	707912	707761	707761	I	0	" He rose and threw a quantity of small coal upon the fire , so as to smother the flame , and create a dense smoke . He then passed each bill several times through the smoke , until the documents acquired a slightly dingy hue . Lastly , he placed them between the leaves of a portfolio scented with musk , so as to take off the odour of the smoke ; and the entire process was terminated . Mr. Greenwood now counted upon the table bank - notes to the aggregate amount of the two hundred pounds promised , and the price of the stamps ; and in exchange he received the bills for twenty - three thousand two hundred and seventeen pounds , nine shillings , and sevenpence halfpenny . "
707925	707940	707922	707923	Mr. Pennywhiffe	1602	" said Greenwood , as he placed the bills in his pocket - book . "
707965	707966	707955	707958	the inmates of each	18985	" "
708152	708153	708155	708155	he	18997	" "
708162	708187	708155	708155	he	18997	" said Mr. Greenwood , rising to take his departure . At this moment a double knock at the front - door was heard . "
708194	708283	708155	708155	he	18997	" exclaimed Mr. Pennywhiffe . Urged by curiosity to catch a glimpse of the mysterious gentleman alluded to , Greenwood hurried on his cloak , took leave of the caligrapher , and left the room . On the stairs he met the lodger , who was ascending to his attic , with a brass candlestick , containing an inch of the commonest candle , in his hand . The moment he and Greenwood thus encountered each other , an ejaculation of surprise issued from the lips of each . "
708290	708304	708155	708155	he	18997	" said the gentleman , placing his fore - finger upon his lip . "
708312	708320	708310	708310	Greenwood	903	" he continued , in a whisper , "
708330	708331	708321	708321	you	903	" "
708338	708367	708321	708321	you	903	" answered Greenwood . They then shook hands , and parted — the gentleman continuing his way to the attic , and Greenwood hastening to leave the house . "
708373	708396	708321	708321	you	903	" thought the latter , as he proceeded towards the cab - stand near Rowland Hill 's chapel in the Blackfriars Road : "
708418	708820	708821	708823	G. M. Greenwood	903	" At half - past four o'clock on the following afternoon , Ellen Monroe was in the immediate vicinity of the Bank of England . She had been to receive a small sum of money which an old debtor of her father 's , residing in Birchin Lane , had written to state that he was in a condition to pay ; and she was now on her return to Markham Place . The evenings of January are obscure , if not quite dark , at that hour ; and the lamps were lighted . As she was proceeding along Lothbury , Greenwood suddenly passed her . He was walking rapidly , in a pre - occupied manner , and did not perceive her . But she beheld him ; and she turned to speak to him ; for in spite of all the injuries which her parent , her benefactor Richard , and herself had sustained at his hands , he was still the father of her child ! Scarcely had she thus turned , when he drew his handkerchief from his pocket — still hurrying on towards Tokenhouse Yard . Ellen quickened her pace ; but in a few moments her foot encountered an object on the pavement . She stooped , and picked it up . It was a pocket - book . Conceiving that Greenwood might have dropped it , as she had found it on the very spot where she had seen him take his handkerchief from his pocket , she ran in the direction which she supposed him to have pursued ; but as , in the mean time , he had turned into the narrow alley called Tokenhouse Yard , and as she continued her way along Lothbury towards Throgmorton Street , she did not of course overtake him . Finding that her search after him was unavailing , she determined to examine the contents of the pocket - book , and ascertain if it really did belong to him ; in which case , she resolved to proceed straight to Spring Gardens , and restore it to him . Retracing her steps along Lothbury , she entered Cateaton Street ; and turning into the Old Jewry , which was almost deserted , she stopped beneath the light of a lamp to open the pocket - book . It contained several letters , addressed to "
708830	709090	708821	708823	G. M. Greenwood	903	" and thus her doubts were cleared up at once . But as she was thus investigating the interior of the pocket - book , her eye fell upon a number of bills of exchange , all drawn and endorsed by Mr. Greenwood , and accepted for large sums by noblemen , well - known landowners , and eminent merchants . A rapid glance over these documents convinced Ellen that the aggregate amount which they represented could not fall far short of twenty - five thousand pounds ; for , in addition to the fictitious bills obtained from Pennywhiffe , Greenwood had placed in his pocket - book several genuine ones which he legitimately possessed . Miss Monroe 's scrutiny did not altogether occupy a minute ; and , carefully securing the pocket - book about her person , she hurried towards Cheapside , where she entered a cab , directing the driver to take her to Spring Gardens . She did not forget Greenwood 's former conduct in having her carried away to his house in the country ; but she did not apprehend any ill - usage at his hands in a part of London where succour would be so readily obtained as in Spring Gardens . It was therefore without hesitation that she resolved to proceed direct to his own dwelling in that quarter . In due time the vehicle stopped at Greenwood 's house in Spring Gardens . With a beating heart Ellen knocked at the door , which was almost immediately opened by Filippo . "
709096	709114	709093	709094	Miss Monroe	1117	" he exclaimed , as the light of the hall - lamp fell upon her beautiful countenance . "
709126	709134	709119	709119	I	0	" she answered , with a smile : "
709140	709141	709136	709136	he	903	" "
709165	709166	709154	709154	he	903	" "
709174	709472	709168	709168	I	0	" said Ellen . Filippo conducted her up stairs . In the window of the staircase still stood the beautiful model of the Diana , holding a lamp in its hand,—that model which was the image of her own faultless form . On the landing - place , communicating with the drawing - room , was also the marble statue , the bust of which was sculptured in precise imitation of her own . And , when she entered the drawing - room , the first object which met her eyes was the picture of Venus rising from the ocean , surrounded by nereids and nymphs,—that Venus which was a faithful likeness of herself ! Oh ! how many phases of her existence did these permanent representations of her matchless beauty bring back to her memory ! When Filippo left her , and she found herself alone , she fell upon a sofa , and gave way to a violent flood of tears . Then she felt relieved ; and she began to ask herself wherefore she had come thither ? Was it because she was glad to have found an excuse for calling upon him who was the father of her child ? was it because she was anxious to receive his thanks — from his own lips — for restoring to him his pocket - book ? She scarcely knew . Half an hour passed in reflections of this nature — reflections which branched off in so many different ways , and converged to no satisfactory point — when a cab suddenly drove up to the house . In another minute hasty steps ascended the stairs — they approached the drawing - room — and Greenwood rushed in , banging the door furiously behind him . "
709481	709503	709478	709478	I	0	" he exclaimed , frantically — for he did not immediately perceive Ellen , whom a screen concealed from his view . "
709523	709644	709645	709645	Ellen	1117	" He said no more , but threw himself upon a chair , and buried his face in his hands . Ellen instantly comprehended it all:—the bills which she had seen in the pocket - book were forgeries ! Rapid as lightning a train of new reflections passed through her brain:—a project suggested itself;—she hesitated for a moment — but only for a moment:—she thought of her child — and she was resolved . Assuming all her calmness , and calculating in an instant all the chances of her scheme , she rose from the sofa , and slowly approached the chair on which Greenwood was seated . He heard a step in the room , and raised his eyes . "
709647	709668	709645	709645	Ellen	1117	" he exclaimed , starting back in surprise . She murmured a Christian name — but it was not George . "
709676	709682	709645	709645	Ellen	1117	" cried Greenwood , fiercely : "
709693	709716	709645	709645	Ellen	1117	" he added , speaking thickly , and at the same instant casting upon her a glance which seemed to pierce her inmost soul,—"tell

709737	709751	709734	709734	I	0	" answered Ellen , gazing , in her turn , fixedly upon him . "
709757	709758	709753	709753	you	0	" "
709766	709779	709763	709763	you	0	" continued Miss Monroe , keeping her eyes still bent upon him . "
709787	709788	709783	709783	you	0	" "
709795	709804	709790	709790	you	0	" added Ellen , in an emphatic tone ; "

709815	709819	709822	709822	you	0	" ejaculated Greenwood . "
709864	709865	709885	709885	he	19015	" "
709871	709878	709885	709885	he	19015	" thought Ellen , within herself : "
709891	709896	709885	709885	he	19015	" she exclaimed aloud ; "
709903	709904	709885	709885	he	19015	" "
709914	709920	709885	709885	he	19015	" cried Greenwood , frantically . "
709936	709945	709946	709946	me	0	" he added , suddenly becoming cool — desperately cool:—"tell

709967	709971	709946	709946	me	0	" answered Ellen . "
709975	709979	709986	709986	you	0	" repeated Greenwood : "
709983	709984	709986	709986	you	0	" "
709992	709998	709986	709986	you	0	" was the steady reply . "
710002	710009	709986	709986	you	0	" exclaimed Greenwood , laughing hysterically . "
710129	710130	710127	710127	Ellen	1117	" "
710138	710142	710127	710127	Ellen	1117	" cried Ellen . "

710210	710211	710241	710241	you	1117	" "
710227	710238	710213	710213	I	0	" said the young lady , in a hasty tone . "
710251	710257	710248	710248	you	1117	" he exclaimed , bewildered . "
710307	710308	710309	710309	I	0	" "
710319	710323	710309	710309	I	0	" said Ellen . "

710336	710357	710324	710324	Your	0	" repeated Greenwood , electrified by that word , and not knowing whether it imported good or evil to him : "
710365	710366	710361	710361	you	1117	" "
710371	710374	710376	710376	me	0	" answered Miss Monroe;—"and
710378	710379	710376	710376	me	0	" "
710385	710389	710383	710383	Ellen	1117	" cried Greenwood . "
710396	710397	710383	710383	Ellen	1117	" "
710414	710420	710403	710403	I	0	" asked the young lady . "
710452	710465	710445	710445	Ellen	1117	" And he advanced towards her , with out - stretched hands . "
710471	710482	710445	710445	Ellen	1117	" exclaimed the young lady , in a firm tone . "
710574	710575	710560	710560	I	0	" "
710586	710600	710601	710601	you	0	" cried Greenwood , his countenance becoming livid with mingled fear and rage : "
710657	710706	710728	710728	their	2180	" And he rushed towards her , as a tiger springs upon its victim . But Ellen , light as the fawn , glided away from him , and took such a position that a table was between them , and a bell - pull within her reach . "
710714	710718	710720	710720	I	0	" she exclaimed , "
710756	710757	710749	710749	your	0	" "
710760	710770	710749	710749	your	0	" cried Greenwood , grinding his teeth with rage . "
710778	710779	710776	710776	Ellen	1117	" "
710791	710814	710776	710776	Ellen	1117	" she answered , drawing herself up to her full height , and assuming all the influence of her really queenly beauty . "
710817	710821	710831	710831	God	880	" ejaculated Greenwood . "
710848	710849	710835	710835	I	0	" "
710861	710877	710850	710850	You	1117	" replied Ellen , calmly , and with a slightly satirical curl of the lip . "
710889	710897	710887	710887	Ellen	1117	" persisted Greenwood , urged to desperation . "
710904	710910	710887	710887	Ellen	1117	" said the young lady . "
710934	710939	710931	710931	God	880	" she added solemnly , "
710963	710964	710965	710965	You	1117	" "
710984	710988	710973	710973	you	1117	" cried Greenwood : "
711004	711005	710994	710994	you	1117	" "
711031	711037	711039	711039	he	6938	" answered Ellen , emphatically ; "
711050	711051	711039	711039	he	6938	" "
711058	711063	711053	711053	you	1117	" again remonstrated Greenwood , "
711120	711121	711115	711115	Ellen	1117	" "
711134	711139	711115	711115	Ellen	1117	" interrupted Miss Monroe . "
711177	711178	711174	711175	a wife	26722	" "
711187	711191	711185	711185	Ellen	1117	" persisted Greenwood : "
711196	711197	711185	711185	Ellen	1117	" "
711235	711236	711237	711245	A woman who is determined to gain her point	19045	" "
711251	711257	711237	711245	A woman who is determined to gain her point	19045	" muttered Greenwood to himself . "
711263	711267	711260	711260	you	0	" asked Ellen . "
711341	711342	711343	711343	Ellen	1117	" "
711351	711362	711345	711345	I	0	" said Greenwood , in a tone of deep humiliation ; "
711380	711381	711384	711384	you	0	" "
711394	711399	711387	711387	I	0	" interrupted Miss Monroe . "
711429	711430	711435	711435	you	0	" "
711494	711495	711496	711496	Marian	1264	" "
711510	711515	711496	711496	Marian	1264	" answered Miss Monroe . "
711541	711545	711546	711546	I	0	" said Greenwood . "
711589	711590	711586	711587	a lady	4378	" "
711600	711604	711594	711594	you	0	" returned Ellen . "
711617	711624	711615	711615	her	1213	" She then rang the bell . "
711632	711644	711627	711627	you	0	" asked Greenwood , alarmed by this movement on her part . "
711669	711673	711657	711657	I	0	" replied Ellen . "
711684	711834	711657	711657	I	0	" Filippo made his appearance ; and Ellen then took leave of Mr. Greenwood , as if nothing peculiar had occurred between them . Oh ! with what joy — with what fervid , intoxicating joy — did she return to Markham Place ! She had subdued him whose cold , calculating , selfish heart was hitherto unacquainted with honourable concessions;—she had conquered him — reduced him to submit to her terms — imposed her own conditions ! Never — never before had she embraced her child with such pride — such undiluted happiness as on that evening . And never had she herself appeared more beautiful — more enchantingly lovely ! Her lips were wreathed in smiles — her eyes beamed with the transports of hope , triumph , and maternal affection — a glow of ineffable bliss animated her countenance — her swelling bosom heaved with rapture . "
711844	711860	711861	711861	I	0	" said Mr. Monroe , when she took her seat at the tea - table : "
711867	711868	711861	711861	I	0	" "
711882	711886	711869	711869	I	0	" answered Ellen . "
711920	711929	711911	711911	you	0	" she added , with a sweet smile , "
711941	711942	711943	711943	You	6961	" "
711973	711978	711970	711970	I	0	" continued Mr. Monroe , "
712025	712026	712004	712004	God	880	" "
712040	712051	712052	712052	I	0	" returned Ellen , a cloud passing over her countenance . "
712072	712092	712064	712064	he	874	" We must observe that the news of our hero 's success at Estella had not yet reached England . "
712103	712112	712064	712064	he	874	" said Mr. Monroe , after a pause , "
712135	712136	712138	712138	I	0	" "
712146	712148	712141	712141	he	874	" added Ellen;—"yes
712153	712262	712141	712141	he	874	" she repeated , with strange emphasis upon these words . On the following morning , a few minutes before ten o'clock , a post - chaise stopped at the gate of the parish church of Hackney ; and Mr. Greenwood alighted . He was pale ; and the quivering of his lip denoted the agitation of his mind . The clock was striking ten , when a hackney - coach reached the same point . Greenwood hastened to the door , and assisted Mrs. Wentworth and Ellen Monroe to descend the steps . As he handed out the latter , he said , in a hurried whisper , "
712272	712273	712274	712274	I	0	" "
712277	712388	712274	712274	I	0	" answered Ellen . The party then proceeded to the church , the drivers of the vehicles being directed to await their return at a little distance , so as not to attract the notice of the inhabitants . The clergyman and the clerk awaited the arrival of the nuptial party . The ceremony commenced — proceeded — and terminated . Ellen was now a wife ! Her husband imprinted a kiss upon her pale forehead ; and at the same moment she handed him the pocket - book . In a few minutes the marriage - certificate was in her possession . Drawing her husband aside , she said , "
712419	712420	712421	712421	Ellen	1117	" "
712423	712427	712421	712421	Ellen	1117	" interrupted Greenwood , "
712473	712484	712471	712471	Ellen	1117	" he added , his countenance lighting up with animation ; "
712508	712509	712500	712501	your father	2203	" "

712628	712632	712633	712633	I	0	" replied Ellen . "
712639	712645	712636	712636	I	0	" answered Greenwood , earnestly . "
712674	712675	712663	712663	I	0	" "
712684	712708	712663	712663	I	0	" murmured Ellen , pressing his hand fervently , and regarding him with affection — for he was the father of her child ! "
712713	712732	712663	712663	I	0	" answered Greenwood;—but his bride perceived not how much of sensual passion prompted him on the present occasion . "

712824	712828	712829	712829	You	1117	" replied Greenwood . "
712831	712841	712829	712829	You	1117	" exclaimed Ellen , with a smile of satisfaction . "
712880	713212	713213	713213	We	19087	" Ellen hastened to the vestry where the surgeon 's wife was seated near a cheerful fire ; and the arrangement desired by Greenwood was soon made . The party then proceeded to the vehicles . Mrs. Wentworth bade the newly - married couple adieu , having faithfully promised to retain their secret inviolate ; and Greenwood handed her into the hackney - coach . He and Ellen entered the post - chaise ; and while the surgeon 's wife retraced her way to her own abode , the bride and bridegroom hastened to Richmond . We must now request our readers to accompany us once more to Castelcicala . In an incredibly short time , and by dint of a forced march which put the mettle of his troops to a severe test,—at which , however , they did not repine , for they were animated by the dauntless courage and perseverance of their commander.—Richard Markham arrived beneath the walls of Villabella . During his progress towards the town , he had been joined by upwards of four hundred volunteers , all belonging to the national militia , and armed and equipped ready for active service . The daring exploit which had made him master of Estella , had created an enthusiasm in his favour which he himself and all his followers considered to be an augury of the final success of the Constitutional Cause ; and in every village — in every hamlet through which his army had passed , was he welcomed with the most lively demonstration of joy . When , early on the morning of the 1st of January , his advanced guard emerged from the woods which skirted the southern suburb of Villabella , the arrival of the Constitutional Army was saluted by the roar of artillery from the ramparts ; and almost at the same moment the tri - coloured flag was hoisted on every pinnacle and every tower of the great manufacturing town . "
713220	713230	713213	713213	We	19087	" exclaimed Richard , as he pointed towards Villabella . "
713243	713359	713361	713361	me	0	" The army halted beneath the walls of Villabella , for Richard did not deem it proper to enter those precincts until formally invited to do so by the corporation . He , however , immediately despatched a messenger to the mayor , with certain credentials which had been supplied him by the Committee of Administration at Estella ; and in the course of an hour the municipal authorities of Villabella came forth in procession to welcome him . The mayor was a venerable man of eighty years of age , but with unimpaired intellects , and a mind still young and vigorous . Alighting from his horse , Richard hastened forward to meet him . "
713369	713374	713361	713361	me	0	" exclaimed the mayor . "
713386	713396	713361	713361	me	0	" he added , turning and pointing towards Villabella , "
713415	713570	713361	713361	me	0	" Then the mayor embraced Richard in presence of the corporation — in presence of the Constitutional Army ; and the welkin rang with shouts of enthusiastic joy . The formal invitation to enter Villabella was now given ; and Markham issued the necessary orders . The corporation led the way : next came the General , attended by his staff ; and after him proceeded the long lines of troops , their martial weapons gleaming in the morning sun . The moment our hero passed the inner drawbridge , the roar of cannon was renewed upon the ramparts ; and the bells in all the towers commenced a merry peal . As at Estella , the windows were thronged with faces — the streets were crowded with spectators — and every testimonial of an enthusiastic welcome awaited the champion of Constitutional Liberty . Then resounded , too , myriads of voices , exclaiming , "
713573	713576	713361	713361	me	0	Alberto"—"Long live the General!"—"Down
713579	713584	713361	713361	me	0	Tyrant!"—"Death to the Austrians ! "
713673	713695	713697	713697	he	874	" although he could never again bear arms in favour of the Grand Duke , he would not fight against him . "
714456	714459	714460	714460	he	874	" Constitutionalists ! "
714463	714484	714460	714460	he	874	" your brethren are victorious elsewhere : abandon not the field ! Follow me — to conquest or to death ! "
715022	715038	715013	715013	he	874	" I am the servant , sir , and not the master of the Castelcicalans . "
715599	715603	715593	715594	the Colonel	30185	command—"General salute ! Present arms!"—and
715655	715659	715697	715697	he	874	" Shoulder arms ! "
715910	715916	715918	715918	Richard	874	" Every thing favours me ! "
715926	715998	715918	715918	Richard	874	" Oh ! for success at Abrantani ; and such will be its moral effect upon my troops that I shall fear nothing for the result of the grand and final struggle that must take place beneath the walls of Montoni ! And , then , Isabella , even your father will acknowledge that I have some claim to your hand as a reward for placing him upon the ducal throne ! "
716607	716615	716617	716617	Richard	874	" By this time to - morrow , "
716627	716648	716617	716617	Richard	874	" the tower on which yon spire stands shall echo with the sounds of its bells to celebrate our triumph ! "
716649	716652	716654	716654	Morcar	1364	" Amen ! "
717938	717946	717947	717955	The Committee of Government of the State of Castelcicala	19376	" Montoni , January 9th , 1841 . "
718033	718090	718187	718187	GAETANO	1616	" The Committee can not , however , omit one duty which they now perform by virtue of the full powers of administration and government that have been vested in them by the inhabitants of the capital , and which powers are recognised by all faithful Castelcicalans who have declared in favour of the Constitutional cause . "
718113	718152	718106	718111	the General - in - Chief	19316	" The Committee of Government have therefore ordained , and do ordain , that the style and title of Marquis of Estella be conferred upon the General - in - Chief , the most Excellent Signor Richard Markham . "
718177	718186	718187	718187	GAETANO	1616	" By order of the Committee of Government — "
718196	718204	718187	718187	GAETANO	1616	" The second despatch ran thus : — "
718223	718227	718228	718228	We	19387	" My Lord , "
718427	718455	718456	718456	We	19387	" We feel convinced that these brief statements will be sufficient to induce your lordship to lose no time in marching to the deliverance of the capital . "
718466	718473	718463	718464	My Lord	27330	" Your lordship 's obedient servants , "
718492	718507	718488	718490	Vice - President	19384	" Montoni , January 9th , 1841 ( Six o'clock in the morning . ) "
719115	719135	719136	719136	GAETANO	1616	" Hasten , my lord — delay not ! In forty - eight hours it will be too late ! "
719138	719163	719136	719136	GAETANO	1616	" Richard instantly despatched a messenger , on whose prudence and daring he could rely , with an answer equally brief and impressive : — "
719193	719196	719167	719167	signor	17435	" ESTELLA . "
720792	720957	720755	720755	Legino,—he	1619	" Long ere this will reach thee , dearest one , thou wilt have heard , by means of telegraphic dispatch through France , of the great victory which has made me master of Castelcicala . If there be any merit due unto myself , in consummating this great aim , and conducting this glorious cause to its final triumph , it was thine image , beloved Isabella , which nerved my arm and which gave me intelligence to make the combinations that have led to so decided an end . In the thickest of the fight — in the midst of danger,—when balls whistled by me like hail , and the messengers of death were circulating in every direction,—thine eyes seemed to be guiding stars of hope , and promise , and love . And now the first moment that I can snatch from the time which so many circumstances compel me to devote to your native land , is given to thee ! "
720991	721009	721010	721010	RICHARD	874	" Although men now call me Marquis of Estella , to thee , dearest , I am simply "
721012	721348	721010	721010	RICHARD	874	" Our hero despatched this letter in one to Signor Viviani at Pinalla , by especial courier . He next wrote hasty accounts of the great victory which he had gained , to the chief authorities of the various cities and towns which had first declared in his favour , as before mentioned ; and these also were instantly sent off by messengers . Then soon did rumour tell the glorious tale how Montoni was delivered ; and how the mighty flood of Austrian power , which had dashed its billows against the walls of the ducal capital , was rolled back over the confines of Castelcicala into the Roman States , never to return ! We shall not dwell upon the particulars of that night which succeeded the battle . Our readers can imagine the duties that devolve upon a commander after so brilliant and yet so sanguinary a day . Suffice it to observe , that Richard visited the houses in the village to which the wounded had been conveyed ; while Colonel Cossario took possession of the Austrian camp . That night Montoni was brilliantly illuminated ; and the most exuberant joy prevailed throughout the capital . The Committee of Government assembled in close deliberation , immediately after the receipt of the welcome tidings of the victory ; and , although they consulted in secret , still the inhabitants could well divine the subject of their debate — the best means of testifying their own and the nation 's gratitude towards that champion who had thus diffused joy into so many hearts . Early in the morning , the entire Committee , dressed in their robes , and attended by the chief officers of the garrison , repaired on horseback to the village where Richard had established his head - quarters . Our hero came forth to meet them , at the door of the mansion where he was lodged , and received those high functionaries with his plumed hat in hand . "
721352	721363	721010	721010	RICHARD	874	" exclaimed Signor Gaëtano , the President of the Committee , "
721502	721503	721492	721493	their organ	19569	" "
721506	721510	721492	721493	their organ	19569	" answered Richard : "
721551	721552	721553	721554	My lord	27330	" "
721556	721561	721553	721554	My lord	27330	" returned the President , "
721570	721571	721562	721562	Castelcicala	1085	" "
721588	721592	721578	721578	I	0	" exclaimed Markham ; "
721634	721638	721639	721640	your troops	19577	" continued Markham ; "
721671	721672	721662	721662	I	0	" "
721682	721687	721689	721689	your	27330	" answered the President ; "
721701	721702	721703	721703	I	0	" "
721716	722355	721703	721703	I	0	" rejoined Markham . The President then communicated to the Regent the pleasing fact that the Lord High Admiral had that morning hoisted the tri - coloured flag and sent an officer to signify his adhesion to the victorious cause . In answer to a question from Signor Gaëtano , Richard signified his intention of entering Montoni at three o'clock in the afternoon . The principal authorities then returned to the capital . Long before the appointed hour , the sovereign city wore an aspect of rejoicing and happiness . Triumphal arches were erected in the streets through which the conqueror would have to pass : the troops of the garrison were mustered in the great square of the palace ; and a guard of honour was despatched to the southern gate . The windows were filled with smiling faces : banners waved from the tops of the houses . The ships in the harbour and roadstead were decked in their gayest colours ; and boats were constantly arriving from the fleet with provisions of all kinds for the use of the inhabitants . The great bell in the tower of Saint Theodosia at length proclaims the hour of three . And , now — hark ! the artillery roars — Montoni salutes her Regent : the guard of honour presents arms ; the martial music plays a national air ; and the conqueror enters the capital . The men - of - war in the roadstead thunder forth echoes to the cannon on the ramparts ; and the yards are manned in token of respect for the representative of the sovereign power . What were Richard 's feelings now ? But little more than two months had elapsed since he had first entered that city , a prisoner — vanquished — with shattered hopes — and uncertain as to the fate that might be in store for him . How changed were his circumstances ! As a conqueror — a noble — and a ruler did he now make his appearance in a capital where his name was upon every tongue , and where his great deeds excited the enthusiasm , the admiration , and the respect of every heart . Then his ideas were reflected still farther back ; and he thought of the time when he was a prisoner , though innocent , in an English gaol . Far more rapidly than we can record his meditations , did memory whirl him through all past adversities — reproduce before his mental eyes his recent wanderings in Castelcicala — and hurry him on to this glorious consummation , when he finds himself entering the capital as the highest peer in the State . On his right hand was Colonel Cossario ; and close behind him — amidst his brilliant staff — was Morcar,—the faithful gipsy whose devotedness to his master had not a little contributed to this grand result . On went the procession amidst the enthusiastic applause of the myriads collected to welcome the conquerors,—on through streets crowded to the roof - tops with happy faces,—on to the ducal palace , in whose great square ten thousand troops were assembled to receive the Regent . Richard alighted from his horse at the gate of the princely abode , on the threshold of which the municipal authorities were gathered to receive him . Oh ! at that moment how deeply — how sincerely did he regret the loss of General Grachia , Colonel Morosino , and the other patriots who had fallen in the fatal conflict of Ossore ! Nor less did memory recall the prophetic words of that departed girl who had loved him so devotedly , but so unhappily;—those words which Mary - Anne , with sybilline inspiration , had uttered upon her death - bed:—"Brilliant
722456	722486	722439	722439	Richard	874	" We must again transport our readers to the great metropolis of England . It was late in the evening of the 24th of January , 1841,—with Byron , we "
722492	722881	722439	722439	Richard	874	dates,"—that a man , of herculean form , weather - beaten countenance , and whose age was apparently somewhat past forty , was passing down Drury Lane . He was dressed like a labourer , with a smock frock and a very broad - brimmed straw hat , which was slouched as much as possible over his face . Passing into Blackmoor Street , he continued his way towards Clare Market ; whence he turned abruptly into Clements ' Lane , and entered a public - house on the right hand side of this wretched scene of squalor and poverty . No one possessing the least feeling of compassion for the suffering portion of the industrious millions—(and how large is that portion!)—can pass along the miserable thoroughfare called Clements ' Lane without being shocked at the internal misery which the exterior appearance of many of the dwellings bespeaks . There is ever a vile effluvium in that narrow alley — a miasma as of a crowded churchyard ! Entering the parlour of the public - house , the man with the weather - beaten countenance and slouched hat was immediately recognised by a lad seated apart from the other inmates of the room . This youth was about eighteen or nineteen years of age , very short in stature , but well made . On a former occasion we have stated that his countenance was effeminate and by no means bad - looking ; his eyes were dark and intelligent ; his teeth good ; and his voice soft and agreeable . His manners were superior to his condition ; and his language was singularly correct for one who was almost entirely self - taught , and who had filled menial employments since his boyhood . He was dressed in a blue jacket and waistcoat , and dark brown trousers ; and that attire , together with a boy 's cap , contributed towards the extreme youthfulness of his appearance . A pint of porter stood , untouched , upon a table at which he was sitting . The man with the weather - beaten countenance proceeded to take his seat next to this lad : he then rang the bell , and having ordered some liquor and a pipe , entered into conversation with his young companion . "
722895	722900	722893	722893	Harry	1474	" asked the man . "
722912	722916	722910	722910	Jem	1005	" replied Holford . "

723474	723478	723462	723462	you	1134	" whispered Holford . "

723667	723676	723677	723679	A beautiful lady	19611	" answered Holford , in a mysterious tone . "
723690	723695	723682	723682	you	1134	" demanded Crankey Jem . "
723710	723714	723677	723679	A beautiful lady	19611	" replied Holford , "
723758	723763	723750	723750	she	19611	" he added mournfully , "

723812	723819	723806	723806	She	26716	" said Crankey Jem , interrogatively . "

723903	723908	723901	723901	Harry	1134	" said his companion ; "

723932	723943	723926	723926	your	19616	" muttered Holford , a cloud passing over his countenance . "
724165	724166	724167	724167	You	19622	" "
724173	724202	724169	724171	a singular lad	19623	" said Crankey Jem , eyeing the youth with no small degree of astonishment , and some suspicion that he was not altogether right in his upper storey . "
724262	724263	724265	724265	I	0	" "
724272	724276	724265	724265	I	0	" said Holford . "

724310	724314	724305	724305	she	19618	" demanded Jem . "
724325	724375	724305	724305	she	19618	" answered Harry . Crankey Jem had commenced an observation in reply , when one of the persons who were sitting drinking at another table , suddenly struck up a chant in so loud and boisterous a tone that it completely drowned the voice of Holford 's companion : — "
724385	724399	724382	724383	young sprig	1622	" said Crankey Jem , when the song was brought to a conclusion . "
724439	724545	724434	724434	I	0	" Holford rose , and followed Crankey Jem from the public - house . The latter led the way to a court in Drury Lane ; and introduced the lad into a small back chamber , which was tolerably neat and comfortable . On a table near the window , were small models of ships , executed with considerable taste ; various tools ; blocks of wood , not yet shaped ; paint - pots , brushes , twine , little brass cannon and anchors,—in a word , all the articles necessary for the miniature vessels which are seen in the superior toy - shops . "
724557	724568	724555	724555	Harry	1134	" said Jem , pointing towards the work - table . "
724617	724686	724608	724608	Harry	1134	" Jem stirred the fire , and then busied himself to spread a small round table standing in the middle of the room , with some cold meat , a substantial piece of cheese , and a quartern loaf . He also produced from his cupboard a bottle of spirits , and when there was a good blaze in the grate , he placed the kettle to boil . "
724698	724708	724696	724696	Jem	873	" said Holford , when these preparations were concluded . "
724723	724728	724720	724720	I	0	" was the answer . "

724790	724796	724780	724780	you	0	" cried Jem , laughing ; "

724906	724910	724894	724894	you	1134	" exclaimed Holford , "

724986	724990	724984	724984	Harry	1134	" said Jem . "
725008	725056	725002	725002	I	0	" They ate their supper with a good appetite . Jem — who was somewhat methodical after a fashion — cleared away the things , and placed two clean tumblers and a bowl full of sugar upon the table . When the grog was duly mixed , and "
725062	725268	725269	725269	My	0	" as the man termed it , he commenced his truly remarkable history , which we have corrected and improved as to language , in the following manner . My father 's name was Robert Cuffin . At the death of his father he succeeded to a good business as grocer and tea - dealer ; but he was very extravagant , and soon became bankrupt . He obtained his certificate , and then embarked as a wine merchant . At the expiration of three years he failed again , and once more appeared in the Gazette . This time he was refused his certificate . He , however , set up in business a third time , and became a coal merchant . His extravagances continued : so did his misfortunes . He failed , was thrown into prison , and took the benefit of the Insolvents ' Act — but not without a long remand . On his release from gaol , he turned dry - salter . This new trade lasted a short time , and ended as all the others had done . Another residence in prison — another application to the Insolvents ' Court — and another remand , ensued . "
725617	725688	725589	725589	gentlemen	27077	" Well , the visitors sate down ; and my father , whose countenance had assumed a most wonderful gravity of expression since the morning , opened the prayer - meeting with a psalm . He then read passages from the two sacred books he had brought with him ; and he wound up the service by an extemporaneous discourse , which drew tears from the eyes of his audience . "
725734	725939	725700	725700	herself	5043	" To be brief — so well did my father play his cards , that he soon gathered about him a numerous congregation ; a chapel was hired somewhere in Goodman 's Fields ; and he was now a popular minister . His flock placed unbounded confidence in him — nay almost worshipped him ; so that , thanks to their liberality , he was soon provided with a nicely - furnished house in the immediate vicinity of the chapel . Next door to him there dwelt a poor widow , named Ashford , and who had a very pretty daughter called Ruth . These females were amongst the most devoted of my father 's flock ; and in their eyes the reverend preacher was the pattern of virtue and holiness . The widow was compelled to take a little gin at times ' for the stomach 's sake ; ' but one day she imbibed too much , fell down in a fit , and died . My father preached a funeral sermon , in which he eulogised her as a saint ; and he afforded an asylum to the orphan girl . Ruth accordingly became an inmate of my father 's house . "
726290	726505	726287	726288	Miss Ashford.[19	1627	" Thus my father preserved both his mistress and his sanctity — at least for some considerable time longer . The fruit of that amour was myself ; and my name is consequently Ashford — James Ashford — although my father insisted upon calling me Cuffin . Time wore on ; but by degrees the jealousies which my father had at first succeeded in appeasing , developed themselves in an alarming manner between the wife and the mistress . Scenes of violence occurred at the house of his Reverence ; and the neighbours began to think that their minister 's amour was not quite so holy in its nature as he had represented it . The congregation fell off ; and my father 's reputation for sanctity was rapidly wearing out . Still he would not part with my mother and me ; and the result was that his lawful wife left the house with all her own children . My father refused to support them ; the parish officers interfered ; and the scandal was grievously aggravated . Death arrived at this juncture to carry away the principal bone of contention . My mother became dangerously ill , and after languishing in a hopeless condition for a few weeks , breathed her last . "
726641	726814	726817	726817	I	0	" I was totally friendless . Vainly did I call upon the deacons and elders of the congregation ; even those who had adhered to my father to the very last , had their eyes opened now that he was no longer present to reason with them . They spurned me from their doors ; and I was left to beg or steal . I chose the former ; but one night I was taken up by a watchman ( there were no police in those times ) because I was found wandering about without being able to give a satisfactory account of myself . You may look astonished ; but I can assure you that when a poor devil says , ' I am starving — houseless — friendless — pennyless , ' it is supposed to mean that he ca n't give a satisfactory account of himself ! In the morning I was taken before the magistrate , and committed to the House of Correction as a rogue and vagabond . "
727313	727758	727767	727767	he	29781	" Myself and several other convicts , who were sentenced at the same session , were removed from Newgate to the Penitentiary at Millbank . Amongst the number were two persons whose names you may have heard before , because their case made a great noise at the time . These were Robert Stephens and Hugh Mac Chizzle , who were the principal parties concerned in a conspiracy to pass a certain Eliza Sydney off as a young man , and defraud the Earl of Warrington out of a considerable property . We remained about a fortnight in the Penitentiary , and were then transferred to the convict - ship at Woolwich . But before we left Millbank , we were clothed in new suits of grey , or pepper - and - salt , as we called the colour ; and we were also ironed . The convict - ship was well arranged for its miserable purpose . On each side of the between - decks were two rows of sleeping - berths , one above the other : each berth was about six feet square , and was calculated to hold four convicts , eighteen inches ' space to sleep in being considered ample room enough for each individual . The hospital was in the fore - part of the vessel , and was separated from the prison by means of a bulk - head , in which partition there were two strong doors , forming a means of communication between the two compartments . The fore and main hatchways , between decks , were fitted up with strong wooden stanchions round them ; and in each of those stanchions there was a door with three padlocks , to let the convicts in and out , and secure them effectually at night . In each hatchway a ladder was placed , for us to go up and down by ; and these ladders were always pulled on deck after dusk . Scuttle - holes , or small ports to open and shut for the admission of air , were cut along the vessel 's sides ; and in the partition between the prison and the hospital was fixed a large stove , with a funnel , which warmed and ventilated both compartments at the same time . When we were placed on board the convict - ship , we had each a pair of shoes , two pairs of trousers , four shirts , and other warm clothing , besides a bed , bolster , and blanket . Of Bibles , Testaments , and Prayer - Books , there was also plenty . "
727934	728033	727906	727917	a head , or chairman , who saw the provisions weighed out	19728	" The surgeon selected six of the most fitting amongst the convicts to act the part of petty officers , whose duty it was to see his orders punctually executed , and to report instances of misconduct . Four of these remained in the prison ; and the other two were stationed on deck , to watch those convicts who came up in their turns for airing . The Captains of the Deck , as the officers were called , had some little extra allowance for their trouble , and were moreover allowed a certain quantity of tobacco . "
728149	728252	728135	728135	I	0	" The surgeon was a kind and humane man . The moment we were out of sight of land , he ordered our chains to be taken off ; and he allowed us to enjoy as much air upon deck as we could possibly require . The guard , under the command of a commissioned officer , consisted of thirty - one men , and did duty on the quarter - deck in three alternate watches . A sentry , with a drawn cutlass , stood at each hatchway ; and the soldiers on watch always had their fire - arms loaded . "
728783	728980	728757	728758	the surgeon	29781	" I must observe , that while the ship was still in the Thames , none of the convicts would admit that they deserved their fate . They all proclaimed themselves much - injured individuals , and declared that the Home Secretary was certain to order a commutation of their sentence . The usual declarations were these:—'I am sure never to see New South Wales . The prejudice of the judge against me at the trial were evident to all present in the court . The jury were totally misled by his summing - up . My friends are doing every thing they can for me ; and I am sure to get off . '—Out of a hundred and ten convicts , at least a hundred spoke in this manner . But the ship sailed,—England was far behind,—and not one single convict had his hopes of a commuted sentence gratified . Then , when those hopes had disappeared , they all opened their budget of gossip most freely , and related their exploits in so frank a manner , that it was very easy to perceive the justice of the verdicts which had condemned them . "
729233	729647	729675	729676	the guard	17016	" Sydney is beautifully situated . It possesses a fine ascent from a noble harbour ; and its bays , its coves , its gardens , its gentlemen 's seats , form a pleasing spectacle . Then its forests of masts — the Government - house , with its beautiful domain — the numerous wharfs — the thousands of boats upon the glassy water — and Wooloomooloo , with its charming villas and its windmills,—all these combine to enhance the interest of the scene . The town itself is far more handsome than I had expected to find it . The shops are very fine — particularly the silversmiths ' , the haberdashers ' , and confectioners ' , which would not disgrace the West End of London . They are mostly lighted with gas , and in the evening have a brilliant appearance . There is an astonishing number of grog - shops — nearly two hundred and fifty , for a population of 30,000 souls . George Street and Pitt Street are the principal thoroughfares : and the rents are so high that they average from three to five hundred pounds a - year . There are no common sewers in Sydney ; and , although the greater portion of the town stands upon a height , yet many of the principal streets are perfectly level , and the want of a vent for the foul water and other impurities is sadly felt . I may add , that the first appearance of Sydney and its inhabitants does not impress a stranger with the idea of being in a country so far away from Europe ; the language , the manners , and the dress of the people being so closely similar to those of England . But wait a little while , and a closer observation produces a different effect . Presently you will see the government gangs of convicts , marching backwards and forwards from their work in single military file,—solitary ones straggling here and there , with their white woollen Paramatta frocks and trousers , or grey or yellow jackets with duck overalls , all daubed over with broad arrows and initial letters to denote the establishment to which they belong,—and then the gaol - gang , moving sulkily along with their jingling leg - chains,—all these sad spectacles telling a tale of crime and its effects , and proclaiming trumpet - tongued the narrative of human degradation ! "
729819	729886	729814	729815	no tongue	19803	" In the course of a few days we were all divided into sections , according to the degrees of punishment which we were to undergo . Stephens and Mac Chizzle were kept at Sydney : I was sent with some thirty others to Port Macquarie — a place about two hundred and sixty miles , as the crow flies , to the north of Sydney . "
730158	730422	730423	730423	Our	19817	" The chain - gang to which I belonged was stationed at Philip 's Creek ; and our business was to supply timber for the ship - builders on Sarah 's Island . We were lodged in huts of the most miserable description ; and though our toils were so long and arduous , our rations were scarcely sufficient to keep body and soul together . The timber we cut was principally Huon pine ; no beasts of burden were allowed ; and we had to roll the trunks of trees to an immense distance . What with the humid climate , the want of fresh meat , and the severity of the labour , no man who fell ill ever entertained a hope of recovery . Talk of the civilised notions of the English — talk of the humane principles of her penal laws,—why , the Inquisition itself could not have been more horrible than the doom of the convict at Macquarie Harbour ! Again I say , it was true that we were great criminals ; but surely some adequate mode of punishment — some mode involving the means of reformation — might have been devised , without the application of so much real physical torture ! I have heard or read that when the Inquisition put its victims to the rack , it afterwards remanded them to their dungeons , and allowed them leisure to recover and be cured;—but in the penal settlement of Port Macquarie those tortures were renewed daily — and they killed the miserable sufferers by inches ! "
730572	730815	730827	730839	each individual possessing no more food than was sufficient for a single meal	19824	" I had not been at Macquarie Harbour more than five months , when Stephens and Mac Chizzle arrived , and were added to our chain - gang . This punishment they had incurred for having endeavoured to escape from Sydney , where they had been treated with some indulgence , in consequence of their station in life previous to their sentence in England . So miserable was I , with hard work and scanty food , that I resolved to leave the place , or perish in the attempt . I communicated my design to Stephens and Mac Chizzle ; and they agreed to accompany me . Escape from Macquarie was known to be a most difficult undertaking ; and few convicts who essayed it were ever able to reach the settlements in other parts of the Colony . They were either murdered by their comrades for a supply of food , or perished in the bush . Formidable forests had to be traversed ; and the chance of catching kangaroos was the only prospect of obtaining the means of existence . Nevertheless , I resolved to dare all those horrors and fearful risks , rather than remain at Philip 's Creek . Five or six others , in addition to Stephens and Mac Chizzle , agreed to adopt this desperate venture with me ; and one night we stole away — to the number of ten — from the huts . "
731181	731751	731752	731752	I	0	" On the following day Blackley managed to kill a kangaroo , weighing about sixty pounds ; and thus we were supplied with food for three or four days , acting economically . The flesh of the kangaroo is much like venison , and is very fine eating . We continued our way amidst the forest , which appeared endless ; and in due time the kangaroo 's flesh was consumed . Blackley was unwearied in his exertions to provide more food ; and , so much time was wasted in these endeavours , that we made but little progress in our journey . And now , to our terror , Blackley could find no more opossums — could kill no more kangaroos . We grew desperate : starvation was before us . Moody — sulky — glaring on each other with a horribly significant ferocity , we dragged ourselves along . Four days elapsed — and not a mouthful of food had we touched . On the fifth night we made a fire , and sate round it at considerable distances from each other . We all endeavoured to remain awake : we trembled at the approach of drowsiness — for we knew the consequences of sleep in our desperate condition . There we sate — none uttering a word,—with cracked and bloody lips — parched throats — eyes glowing with cannibal fires,—our minds a prey to the most appalling thoughts . At length Mac Chizzle , the lawyer , fell back in a sound slumber , having no doubt found it impossible to bear up against the weariness which was creeping over him . Then Blackley rose , and went farther into the wood . It required no ghost to tell us that he had gone to cut a club for a horrible purpose . The most breathless silence prevailed . At length there was a strange rustling amongst the trees at a little distance ; and then cries of indescribable agony fell upon our ears . These tokens of distress were in the voice of Blackley , who called us by name , one after another . A vague idea of the real truth rivetted us to the spot ; and in a short time the cries ceased altogether . Oh ! what a night of horror was that ! An hour had elapsed since Blackley 's disappearance ; and we had ceased to trouble ourselves concerning his fate:—our own intolerable cravings for food were the sole objects of our thoughts . Nor was Mac Chizzle doomed to escape death . A convict named Felton determined to execute the purpose which Blackley had entertained — though in a different manner . Afraid to venture away from the party to cut a bludgeon , he drew a large clasp - knife from his pocket , and plunged the long sharp blade into the breast of the sleeper . A cry of horror burst from Stephens and myself ; and we rushed forward — now that it was unfortunately too late — to save the victim . We were well aware of the man 's intentions when he approached his victim ; but it was not until the blow was struck that we had the courage to interfere . It was , however , as I have said — too late ! Mac Chizzle expired without a groan . "
731955	732219	731947	731947	themselves	19836	" At length the morning dawned upon that awful and never - to - be - forgotten night . The fire was now extinguished ; but near the ashes lay the entrails and the head of the murdered man . The cannibals had completely anatomised the corpse , and had wrapped up in their shirts ( which they took off for the purpose ) all that they chose to carry away with them . Not a word was spoken amongst us . The last frail links of sympathy — if any really had existed — seemed to have been broken by the incidents of the preceding night . Six men had partaken of the horrible repast ; and they evidently looked on each other with loathing , and on Stephens and myself with suspicion . We all with one accord cut thick sticks , and advanced in the direction whence Blackley 's cries had proceeded a few hours previously . His fate was that which we had suspected : an enormous snake was coiled around the wretch 's corpse — licking it with its long tongue , to cover it with saliva for the purpose of deglutition . We attacked the monstrous reptile , and killed it . Its huge coils had actually squeezed our unfortunate comrade to death ! Then — for the first time for many , many years — did a religious sentiment steal into my soul ; and I murmured to myself : ' Surely this was the judgment of God upon a man who had meditated murder . ' "
732500	732595	732615	732615	them	19846	" In fact , I was not long at large after I separated with Stephens . My convict - dress betrayed me to a party of soldiers : I was arrested , taken to Sydney , tried , and sentenced to transportation to Norfolk Island . Before I left England in 1836 , and since my return towards the end of 1839 , I have heard a great many persons talk about Norfolk Island ; but no one seemed to know much about it . I will therefore tell you something concerning it now . "
733078	733687	733688	733688	You	19883	" There is no attempt to reform the prisoners in Norfolk Island , beyond prayer - reading — and this is of scarcely any benefit . The convicts are too depraved to be amended by mere moral lessons : they want education ; they require to be treated like human beings , instead of brute beasts , criminal though they are ; they need a sufficiency of wholesome food , to enable them to toil with something approaching a good will ; they ought to be protected against the tyranny of overseers , who send them to gaol for the most trivial offences , or on the slightest suspicions ; they should not be forced to labour in chains which gall their ankles almost to the bone , when a guard with loaded muskets is ever near , and seeing that shackles on the legs would not prevent violence with the hands were they inclined to have recourse to it ; nor should they be constantly treated as if they were merely wild beasts whom it is impossible to tame save by means of privation , heart - breaking toil , and the constant sense of utter degradation . How can men be redeemed — reclaimed — reformed by such treatment as this ? Let punishment be terrible — not horrible . It is monstrous to endeavour to render the criminal more obstinate — to make the dangerous one more ferocious — to crush in the soul every inducement to amend — to convert vice into hardened recklessness . The tortures of semi - starvation and overwhelming toil , and the system of retaining men 's minds in a state of moral abasement and degradation in their own eyes , will never lead to reform . When at Macquarie Harbour , or at Norfolk Island , I have often thought how comparatively easy it would be to reclaim even the very worst among the convicts . Teach them practically that while there is life there is hope,—that it is never too late to repent,—that man can show mercy to the greatest sinner , even as God does,—that the most degraded mind may rise from the depths of its abasement,—that society seeks reformation and prevention in respect to crime , and not vengeance,—that the Christian religion , in a word , exists in the heart as well as in a book . But what sentiments do the convicts entertain ? They are taught , by oppressive treatment , to lose sight of their own turpitude , and therefore to consider that all mankind is bent on inflicting a demoniac vengeance upon them;—they look upon the authorities as their persecutors;—they begin to fancy that they are worms which are justified in turning on those who tread them under foot;—they swear , and blaspheme , and talk obscenely , merely because there is no earthly solace left them save in hardening their own hearts against all kindly sympathies and emotions;—they receive the Word of God with suspicion , because man does not practically help them to a belief in the divine assurance relative to the efficacy of repentance;—they are compelled by terrific and unceasing hardships to look upon the tears of a contrite heart as the proofs of moral weakness:—and , in a word , they study how to avoid reflections which can lead , so far as they can see , to no beneficial end . They therefore welcome hardness of heart , obstinacy , and recklessness of disposition as an actual means of escape from thoughts which would , under favourable circumstances , lead to moral amendment and reformation . "
733783	734045	733748	733748	you	19883	" My own prospects were gloomy enough . My life was to be passed in exile , misery , and torture . I loathed my associates . They took all possible pains to tease and annoy each other . They converted a beautiful spot — one of the loveliest islands in the world — into a perfect hell upon earth;—and seemed determined to supply any deficiency which the authorities had left in the sum of our unhappiness . They concocted various schemes of mischief , and then the most hardened would betray their comrades merely for the pleasure of seeing them flogged ! I never shall forget a convict saying to me one day , ' I doubt the existence of a God ; but I wish , if there is one , that he would take away my life , for I am so very miserable . I have only six years more to serve ; and I am determined either to escape , or to murder some one and get hanged for it . '—This man 's name was Anson ; and from that moment he and I had frequent conversations together relative to an escape from the island . But how few were our hopes ? Surrounded by the ocean — pent up in so narrow a space , as it were — so distant from all other lands — fearful to confide in our companions — and unable to carry our scheme into effect without assistance , we were frequently induced to give it up in despair . "
734608	734943	734944	734944	We	19929	" As we had conjectured , there was very little provision on board ; for the Commandant never used the yacht for more than a few hours ' trip at a time . We had therefore done wisely to provide the biscuit ; but there was not two days ' supply of meat on board . We accordingly steered for the back of Philip Island , which we knew to abound in pigs and goats , and to be uninhabited by man . Anson and another of our companions went on shore with fire - arms , which we had found in the cutter ; and within two hours after day - light they shot four pigs and thirteen goats . Myself and the other convict , who remained on board to take care of the vessel and guard the seaman and the boy , caught several king - fish and rock - cod . We were thus well provisioned ; and another trip to the shore filled our water - casks . We next proposed to the seaman and boy either to join us , or to take the skiff and return to Norfolk Island as best they might . They preferred the latter offer ; and we accordingly suffered them to depart , after compelling the sailor to exchange his clothes for one of our convict suits ; so that we had now a proper garb each . In their presence we had talked of running for New Caledonia — an Island to the north of Norfolk Island ; but the moment they were gone , we set sail for New Zealand , which is precisely in a contrary direction — being to the south of Norfolk Island . Our craft was but little better than a cockle - boat : it was , however , decked ; fine weather prevailed ; and moreover , it was better to die by drowning than perish by the gradual tortures of a penal settlement . "

But I was destined to be the only survivor of the four convicts who had escaped from Norfolk Island . When only a few yards from the boat , my companion suddenly relaxed his hold upon the spar , and sank with a loud cry — to rise no more . The water was not tinged with blood — and therefore I do not suppose that he was attacked by a shark : most probably a sudden cramp seized him;—but , whatever the cause , he perished ! I was dragged in an exhausted state into the boat , and was speedily safe on board the bark . "

The streets are spacious : the houses are built of brick ; and the roofs , covered with shingles , have the appearance of being slated . Mount Wellington rises behind the town to the height of 4000 feet , and is almost entirely clothed with forests . There is in Hobart Town a spacious House of Correction for females : it is called the Factory , and contained at that time about two hundred and fifty prisoners . They were employed in picking and spinning wool , and in washing for the Hospital , Orphan - School , and other institutions . The women were dressed in a prison garb , and had their hair cut close , which they naturally considered a grievous infliction of tyranny . When they misbehaved themselves , they were put into solitary confinement ; and I heard that many of them had gone raving mad while enduring that horrible mental torture . I saw a chain - gang of a hundred and ten convicts , employed in raising a causeway across a muddy flat in the Derwent : they looked miserably unhealthy , pale , and emaciated , being half - starved , over - worked , and compelled to drink very bad water . The Government - House is a fine building , on the banks of the Derwent , and about a mile from the town . The Penitentiary at Hobart Town contains about six hundred prisoners , and is the principal receptacle for newly - arrived convicts . They are sent out in gangs , under overseers and guards , to work on the roads , or as carpenters , builders , sawyers , or masons , in the various departments . "

These hags , dressed out in their gayest garb , and pretending to be overwhelmed with grief ( while they really are with gin ) , represent themselves to be the mothers or aunts of the ' poor dear creatures ' who have got into trouble , and assure the surgeon that their so - called daughters or nieces were most excellent girls and bore exemplary characters previous to their present ' misfortune . ' The surgeon — if a novice , or a humane man — believes the tale , and is sure to treat with kindness the ' poor creatures ' thus recommended to him . About twenty years ago a Religious Society in London sent out , in an emigrant ship , twelve ' reclaimed unfortunate girls , ' with the hope that they might form good matrimonial connexions among the free settlers in the colony ; there always having been — especially at first — a great dearth of European females in Australia . These girls were called the Twelve Apostles ; and all England rang with the good work which had been accomplished by the Religious Society . But on the arrival of the Twelve Apostles at Sydney , seven of them were found to be in the family way by the sailors ; and the others immediately entered on a course of unbounded licentiousness.[22 ] "
737210	737498	737499	737499	I	0	" I will tell you one more anecdote relative to Australian marriages . A very handsome woman was transported for shop - lifting — her third offence of the kind . She left a husband behind her in England . On her arrival at Sydney she was allotted to an elderly gentleman , a free settler , and who , being a bachelor , sought to make her his mistress . She , however , resisted his overtures , hoping that he would make her his wife , as he was not aware that she had a husband in her native country . Time wore on , he urgent — she obstinate,—he declining matrimonial bonds . At length she received a black - edged letter from her mother in England ; and upon being questioned by her master , she stated ' that its contents made a great alteration in her circumstances . ' More she would not tell him . He was afraid of losing his handsome servant ; and agreed to marry her . They were united accordingly . When the nuptial knot was indissolubly tied , he begged his beloved wife to explain the nature of the black - edged letter . ' There is now no need for any further mystery , ' she said , ' The truth is , I could not marry you before , because I had a husband living in England . That black - edged letter conveyed to me the welcome news that he was hanged five months ago at the Old Bailey ; and thus nothing now stands in the way of our happiness . '—And that woman made the rich settler a most exemplary wife . "

The bark , in which I worked my passage to Europe , reached England in safety ; and I was once more at large in my native country . Yes — I was free to go whithersoever I would — and to avenge myself on him who had betrayed me to justice ! The hope of some day consummating that vengeance had never deserted me from the moment I was sentenced in the Central Criminal Court . It had animated me throughout all the miseries , the toils , and the hardships which I have related to you . It inspired me with courage to dare the dangers of an escape from Macquarie : its effect was the same when I resolved upon quitting Norfolk Island . I have once had my mortal foe within my reach ; but my hand dealt not the blow with sufficient force . It will not fail next time . I know that vengeance is a crime ; but I can not subdue those feelings which prompt me to punish the man whose perfidy sent me into exile . In all other respects I am reformed — completely reformed . Not that the authorities in Australia or Norfolk Island have in any way contributed to this moral change which has come over me : no — my own meditations and reflections have induced me to toil in order to earn an honest livelihood . I will never steal again : I will die sooner . I would also rather die by my own hand than return to the horrors of Macquarie or Norfolk Island . But my vengeance — Oh ! I must gratify my vengeance;—and I care not what may become of me afterwards ! "

740705	740717	740719	740720	Mr. Tunks,—for	20249	" The business of the evening is over , Mr. Tidkins , "
740728	740764	740722	740724	the Bully Grand	1635	" and we are now deep in the pleasures of the meeting , as you see . Help yourself ! There are spirits of all kinds , and pipes or cigars — whichever you prefer . "
740765	740774	740776	740776	Tidkins	998	" Have you any information to give me ? "
740782	740856	740776	740776	Tidkins	998	" Plenty — but not at this moment , Mr. Tidkins . Take a glass of something to dispel the cold ; and by - and - bye we will talk on matters of business . There is plenty of time ; and many of my young friends here would no doubt be proud to give you a specimen of their vocal powers . Let me see — who 's turn is it ? "
740857	740864	740866	740873	a boy who sate near the Bully Grand	20250	" Leary Lipkins 's , sir , "
740875	740884	740886	740886	Tunks	1637	" Oh ! Leary Lipkins — is it ? "
740889	740910	740886	740886	Tunks	1637	" Now , brother Lipkins , the company are waiting for an opportunity to drink to your health and song . "
740956	740959	740937	740937	he	1638	" Bravo ! "
740960	740963	740886	740886	Tunks	1637	" Brayvo ! "
740964	740971	740937	740937	he	1638	" Bra - ah - vo ! "
741001	741102	740987	740989	The Bully Grand	1635	" Gentlemen , in proposing the health of our excellent brother Leary Lipkins , I might spare eulogy , his merits being so well known to us all . But I feel that there are times when it is necessary to expatiate somewhat on the excellent qualities of the leading members of our honourable Society — in order to encourage an emulative feeling in the breasts of our younger brethren . Such an occasion is the present one , when we are all thus sociably assembled . Gentlemen , you all know Leary Lipkins ! ( Cheers , and cries of "
741109	741241	740987	740989	The Bully Grand	1635	" ) You all know that he is indeed leary in every sense of the word . ( Hear ! hear ! ) He can see through the best bit of broad cloth that ever covered a swell 's pocket . There seems to be a sort of magnetic attraction between his fingers and a gold watch in the fob of a Bond Street lounger . ( Cheers . ) Talk of mesmerism ! why — Leary Lipkins can send a gentleman into a complete state of coma as he walks along the streets , so that he never can possibly feel Leary 's hands in his pockets . Gentlemen , I hold Leary Lipkins up to you as an excellent example ; and beg to propose his very good health . "
741247	741252	741272	741272	he	1638	" three times three . "
741265	741270	741272	741272	he	1638	" a neat speech ; "
741467	741476	741478	741480	that great functionary	20263	" What o'clock is it , Mr. Tidkins ? "
741482	741488	741478	741480	that great functionary	20263	" Half - past ten , "
741493	741508	741510	741510	Tunks	1637	" Well , I will devote my attention to you in a few minutes , "
741512	741543	741510	741510	Tunks	1637	" You may rest perfectly easy — I have obtained information on every point in which you are interested . But — hark ! Shuffling Simon is going to speak ! "

741804	741810	741812	741814	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Now for your information , "
741819	741835	741812	741814	the Resurrection Man	3220	" In the first place , have you discovered any thing concerning Crankey Jem Cuffin ? "
741836	741846	741848	741848	Tunks	1637	" My emissaries have been successful in every instance , "
741855	741880	741848	741848	Tunks	1637	" A man exactly corresponding with your description of Crankey Jem dwells in an obscure court in Drury Lane . Here is the address . "
741881	741888	741890	741890	Tidkins	998	" Any tidings of Margaret Flathers ? "
741892	741932	741890	741890	Tidkins	998	" She has married a young man who answers to your description of Skilligalee ; and they keep a small chandlery - shop in Pitfield Street , Hoxton Old Town . The name of Mitchell is over the door . "
741933	741944	741946	741948	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Your lads are devilish sharp fellows , Bully Grand , "
741952	741978	741980	741980	Tunks	1637	" With thirty - six emissaries all over London every day , it is not so very difficult to obtain such information as you required , "
741982	742002	741980	741980	Tunks	1637	" Moreover , you paid liberally in advance ; and the boys will always be glad to serve you . "
742003	742010	742012	742012	Tidkins	998	" Now for the next question , "
742014	742028	742012	742012	Tidkins	998	" Any news of the old man that Tomlinson goes to see sometimes ? "
742029	742045	741980	741980	Tunks	1637	" Yes — he lives in a small lodging in Thomas Street , Bethnal Green , "
742050	742108	741980	741980	Tunks	1637	" There is his address also . His name is Nelson:—you best know whether it is his right one or not . That is no business of mine . Mr. Tomlinson regularly calls on him every Sunday afternoon , and passes some hours with him . The old man never stirs out , and is very unwell . "
742109	742118	742120	742120	Tidkins	998	" Once more I must compliment your boys , "
742127	742140	742120	742120	Tidkins	998	" Have you been able to learn any thing concerning Katherine Wilmot ? "
742141	742148	742150	742151	Mr. Tunks	1637	" There I have also succeeded , "
742153	742204	742150	742151	Mr. Tunks	1637	" My boys discovered that , after the trial of Katherine , she lunched with some friends at an inn in the Old Bailey , and shortly afterwards left in a post - chaise . She was accompanied by an old lady ; and the chaise took them to Hounslow . "
742205	742218	742220	742222	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And there , I suppose , all traces of them disappear ? "
742226	742261	742267	742269	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Not at all . I sent Leary Lipkins down to Hounslow yesterday ; and he discovered that Miss Wilmot is staying at a farm - house belonging to a Mr. and Mrs. Bennet . "
742262	742265	742267	742269	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Precisely ! "
742271	742301	742315	742317	the Bully Grand	1635	" That Mrs. Bennet was a witness on the trial . I remember reading all about it . She was the sister of the woman whom Reginald Tracy murdered . "
742302	742313	742315	742317	the Bully Grand	1635	" The farm is only a short distance from Hounslow , "
742319	742349	742315	742317	the Bully Grand	1635	" any one in the town can direct you to it . Most probably it was with this Mrs. Bennet that Miss Wilmot travelled in the post - chaise . "
742350	742354	742356	742358	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Evidently so , "
742360	742431	742356	742358	the Resurrection Man	3220	" But of that no matter . All I required was Katherine Wilmot 's address ; and you have discovered it . Now for my last question . Have you ascertained whether it will be possible to bribe the clerk of the church where Lord Ravensworth and the Honourable Miss Adeline Enfield were married , to tear out the leaf of the register which contains the entry of that union ? "
742432	742465	742315	742317	the Bully Grand	1635	" I have learnt that the clerk is open to bribery : but he is a cautious man , and will not allow himself to be sounded too deeply in the matter , "
742470	742478	742480	742482	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Then that business must regard me , "
742484	742514	742480	742482	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You have served me well in all these matters . Twenty pounds I gave you the other day : here are twenty pounds more . Are you satisfied ? "
742515	742527	742529	742531	the Bully Grand	1635	" I have every reason to be pleased with your liberality , "
742544	742553	742540	742540	his	1635	" Have you any further commands at present ? "
742554	742557	742559	742561	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Yes , "
742570	742584	742559	742561	the Resurrection Man	3220	" let one of your lads take a couple of notes for me . "
742617	742706	742599	742599	himself	3220	" The news I have just received are rather good than bad . The clerk is open to bribery , but is cautious . I will myself call upon him the day after to - morrow ; and I will meet you afterwards , at our usual place of appointment , in the evening between six and seven . But you must find money somehow or another : I am incurring expenses in this matter , and can not work for nothing . Surely Greenwood will assist you ? "
742714	742724	742725	742727	The Resurrection Man	952	" Gilbert Vernon , Esq . , No.—Stamford Street . "
742737	742776	742780	742780	he	952	" I have discovered Katherine 's address , and shall call upon you the day after to - morrow at nine o'clock in the evening . Remain at home ; as you know the importance of the business . "
742795	742800	742802	742804	the Resurrection Man	3220	" My good lad , "
742810	742949	742802	742804	the Resurrection Man	3220	" here are two notes , which you must deliver this night — this night , mind . The first is addressed ; and the person for whom it is intended never retires to bed until very late . He will be up , when you call at the house where he lodges in Stamford Street . Give the letter into his own hand . You must then proceed to Golden Lane ; and in the third court on the right - hand side of the way , and in the fourth house on the left - hand in that court , an old woman lives . You must knock till she answers you ; and give her this second letter . I actually do not know her name , although I have dealings with her at present . "
743067	743074	743041	743043	The Resurrection Man	3220	" New Church , Bethnal Green . "
743292	743297	743299	743299	Holford	1134	" I have succeeded ! "
743303	743326	743299	743299	Holford	1134	" the villain lives there ! I have traced him to his lurking - hole ; and Jem may yet be avenged ! "
743812	743827	743829	743830	the duchess	7385	" The dinner - party was tiresome to - day , my dear countess , "
743832	743844	743829	743830	the duchess	7385	" her Majesty did not appear to be in good spirits . "
743845	743848	743850	743851	the lady	2373	" Alas ! "
743855	743872	743850	743851	the lady	2373	" our gracious sovereign 's melancholy fits occur at less distant intervals as she grows older . "
743873	743886	743888	743889	the duchess	7385	" And yet her Majesty has every earthly reason to be happy , "
743891	743911	743888	743889	the duchess	7385	" The Prince appears to be devotedly attached to her ; and the Princess Royal is a sweet babe . "
743912	743921	743923	743924	the countess	5273	" Worldly prosperity will not always ensure felicity , "
743926	744016	743923	743924	the countess	5273	" and this your grace must have perceived amongst the circle of your acquaintance . Her Majesty is a prey to frequent fits of despondency , which are distressing to the faithful subjects who have the honour to be near the royal person . She will sit for an hour at a time , in moody contemplation of that sweet babe ; and her countenance then wears an expression of such profound — such plaintive — such touching melancholy , that I have frequently wept to behold her thus . "
744017	744028	744030	744031	the duchess	7385	" What can be the cause of this intermittent despondency ? "
744033	744038	744040	744041	the countess	5273	" It is constitutional , "
744043	744129	744040	744041	the countess	5273	" The fit comes upon her Majesty at moments when she is surrounded by all the elements of pleasure , happiness , and joy . It is a dark spirit against which no mind , however powerful , can wrestle . The only method of mitigating the violence of its attacks is the bustle of travelling:—then novelty , change of scene , exercise , and the demonstrations of popular devotion seem to relieve our beloved sovereign from the influence of that morbid , moody melancholy . "
744130	744164	744166	744167	the duchess	7385	" I believe that when we conversed upon this topic on a former occasion,—it must be at least two years ago,—your ladyship hinted at the existence of hereditary idiosyncrasies in the Royal Family ? "
744171	744174	744176	744177	her grace	20357	" Indeed , "
744181	744202	744176	744177	her grace	20357	" I well remember that you alluded to the unfortunate attachment of George the Third for a certain Quakeress — — "
744203	744222	744224	744225	the countess	5273	" Yes — Hannah Lightfoot , to whom the monarch , when a prince , was privately united , "
744227	744282	744224	744225	the countess	5273	" His baffled love — the necessity which compelled him to renounce one to whom he was devotedly attached — and the constant dread which he entertained lest the secret of this marriage should transpire , acted upon his mind in a manner that subsequently produced those dread results which are matters of history . "
744283	744290	744292	744293	the duchess	7385	" You allude to his madness , "
744299	744314	744316	744317	the countess	5273	" Yes , your grace — that madness which is , alas ! hereditary , "
744320	744416	744316	744317	the countess	5273	" But George the Third had many — many domestic afflictions . Oh ! if you knew all , you would not be surprised that he had lost his reason ! The profligacy of some of his children — most of them — was alone sufficient to turn his brain . Many of those instances of profligacy have transpired ; and although the public have not been able to arrive at any positive proofs respecting the matters , I can nevertheless assure your grace that such proofs are in existence — and in my possession ! "
744417	744452	744224	744225	the countess	5273	" Your ladyship once before hinted as much to me ; and I must confess that without having any morbid inclination for vulgar scandal , I feel some curiosity in respect to those matters . "
744453	744475	744477	744478	the countess	5273	" Some day I will place in your hand papers of a fearful import , in connexion with the Royal Family , "
744480	744569	744477	744478	the countess	5273	" Your grace will then perceive that profligacy the most abandoned — crimes the most heinous — vices the most depraved , characterised nearly all the children of George the Third . There is one remarkable fact relative to that prince 's marriage with Hannah Lightfoot . The Royal Marriage Act was not passed until thirteen years after this union , and could not therefore set it aside ; and yet Hannah Lightfoot was still living when the prince espoused Charlotte Sophia Princess of Mecklenburgh Strelitz in 1761 . "
744570	744575	744577	744578	the duchess	7385	" Is this possible ? "
744583	744592	744594	744595	the countess	5273	" It is possible — it is true ! "
744598	744673	744594	744595	the countess	5273	" In 1772 the Royal Marriage Act[25 ] was passed , and provided that no member of the Royal Family should contract a marriage without the sovereign 's consent . This measure was enacted for several reasons ; but principally because the King 's two brothers had formed private matrimonial connexions,—the Duke of Cumberland with Mrs. Horton , a widow — and the Duke of Gloucester with the widow of the Earl of Waldegrave . "
744674	744686	744688	744689	the duchess	7385	" The act certainly appears to me most cruel and oppressive , "
744691	744720	744594	744595	the countess	5273	" inasmuch as it interferes with the tenderest affections and most charming of human sympathies — feelings which royalty has in common with all the rest of mankind . "
744721	744729	744731	744732	the countess	5273	" I cordially agree with your grace , "
744734	745022	744731	744732	the countess	5273	" The law is barbarous — monstrous — revolting ; and its evil effects were evidenced by almost every member of the family of George the Third . In the first place , the Prince of Wales ( afterwards George the Fourth ) was privately united to Mrs. Fitzherbert , at the house of that lady 's uncle , Lord Sefton . Fox , Sheridan , and Burke were present at the ceremony , in addition to my mother and several relations of the bride . Mr. Fox handed her into the carriage ; and the happy pair proceeded to Richmond , where they passed a week or ten days . Queen Charlotte was made acquainted with the marriage : she sent for her son , and demanded an explanation . The prince avowed the truth . Your grace has , of course , read the discussion which took place in connexion with this subject , in the House of Commons , in 1787 . Mr. Rolle , the member for Devonshire , mysteriously alluded to the union : Mr. Fox rose up , and denied it ; but from that day forth Mrs. Fitzherbert never spoke to Fox again . Sheridan let the truth escape him:—he said , ' A lady who has been alluded to , is without reproach , and is entitled to the truest and most general respect . ' How would Mrs. Fitzherbert have been without reproach , or entitled to respect , if she were not married to the prince ? But I have proofs — convincing proofs — that such an union did actually take place , although it was certainly null and void in consequence of the Marriage Act . "
745023	745038	745040	745041	the duchess	7385	" It nevertheless subsisted according to the feelings and inclinations of the parties interested , "
745043	745057	745040	745041	the duchess	7385	" and it was based on honour , if on no legal principle . "
745058	745061	745063	745064	the countess	5273	" Alas ! "
745072	745199	745063	745064	the countess	5273	" the word honour must not be mentioned in connexion with the name of George the Fourth . It pains me to speak ill of the ancestors of our lovely queen : but — if we converse on the subject at all — truth must influence our observations . The entire life of George the Fourth was one of profligacy and crime . Often have I marvelled how one possessing a soul so refined as Georgiana , the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire , could have resigned herself to such a degraded voluptuary — such a low debauchee . Yet she was his Queen of Love , surrounded by her graces , who , however , bore the modern names of Craven , Windham , and Jersey . "
745200	745213	745215	745216	the duchess	7385	" Carlton House has , indeed , beheld strange and varied scenes , "
745218	745249	745215	745216	the duchess	7385	" low orgies and voluptuous revels — music floating here — dice rattling there — the refinements of existence in one room , and the most degraded dissipation in another . "
745250	745256	745258	745259	the countess	5273	" Such was the case , "
745261	745351	745258	745259	the countess	5273	" But let us return to the consequences of the Royal Marriage Act . Rumour has told much in connexion with the coupled names of the Duke of York and Mrs. Clarke — the late King William and Mrs. Jordan ; and so well known are these facts that I need not dwell upon them . The matrimonial connexions of the Duke of Sussex — first with Lady Augusta Murray , and afterwards with Lady Cecilia Underwood,[26 ] are all matters resting upon something more solid than mere conjecture . "
745352	745365	745367	745368	the duchess	7385	" And the Duke of Cumberland — the present King of Hanover ? "
745371	745380	745382	745383	the countess	5273	" It is dangerous to speak of him , "
745385	745398	745382	745383	the countess	5273	" because it is impossible to utter a word in his favour . "
745399	745415	745417	745418	the duchess	7385	" You surely can not believe all the tales that have been circulated against him ? "
745435	745447	745449	745450	the countess	5273	" Does your grace particularly allude to the death of Sellis ? "
745465	745468	745470	745470	she	5273	" Because , "
745478	745786	745470	745470	she	5273	" I should be sorry — nay , nothing should induce me — to state in plain terms my impression relative to that event . I may , however , allude to a few material points . Sir Everard Home , the medical attendant of the Duke of Cumberland , frequently observed , ' that too much pains were taken to involve that affair in mystery ; ' and another eminent physician , since dead , declared that ' the head of Sellis was nearly severed from his body , and that no man could inflict upon himself a wound of such a depth . ' The Duke of Cumberland stated that his valet , Sellis , entered his bed - chamber and attacked him with a sword ; and that having failed in his murderous purposes , he retired to his own room and committed suicide . Sir Everard Home distinctly proved , on the inquest , that the corpse was found lying on its side on the bed ; and yet ' he had cut his own throat so effectually that he could not have changed his position after inflicting the wound . ' I will not , however , make any observations upon that fact and this statement which seem so conflicting : the subject is almost too awful to deal with . There is still one remarkable point to which the attention of those who discuss the dark affair should be directed:—the hand - basin in Sellis 's room was half full of blood - stained water , and it is very clear that the miserable wretch himself could not have risen to wash his hands after the wound was inflicted in his throat . But let us not dwell on this horrible event : the mere mention of it makes me shudder . "
745787	745810	745812	745813	the duchess	7385	" The King of Hanover has been , at least , unfortunate in many circumstances of his life , if not guilty , "
745815	745836	745812	745813	the duchess	7385	" because his enemies have insisted strongly upon the suspicious nature of the incident of which we have been speaking . "
745837	745859	745861	745862	the countess	5273	" The more so , because it was known that the Duke of Cumberland had intrigued with the wife of Sellis , "
745864	745905	745861	745862	the countess	5273	" As your grace declares , that exalted personage has been indeed unfortunate — if nothing more . In 1830 Lord Graves committed suicide ; and the improper connexion existing between the Duke of Cumberland and Lady Graves was notorious . "
745906	745911	745913	745914	the duchess	7385	" I well remember , "
745916	745983	745861	745862	the countess	5273	" that the conduct of the Duke and Lady Graves was far from prudent , to say the least of it , after that melancholy event . Scarcely were the remains of the self - slain nobleman cold in the tomb , ere his widow and her illustrious lover were seen driving about together in the neighbourhood of Hampton Court , where Lady Graves had apartments . "
745984	745987	745989	745990	the duchess	7385	" True , "
745992	746359	745989	745990	the duchess	7385	" But we have travelled a long way from our first topic — the Royal Marriage Act . We were speaking of its pernicious effects in respect to the family of George the Third . And that was a fine family , too ! My deceased mother often expatiated — and her secret papers dwell at length — upon the charms of the princesses . Alas ! how sorrowfully were they situated ! In the bloom of youth — in the glow of health — with warm temperaments and ardent imaginations , which received encouragement from the voluptuous indolence of their lives — they were denied the privileges of the meanest peasant girl in the realm:—they were unable to form matrimonial connexions where their inclinations prompted them . The consequences were those which might have been anticipated : the honour of the princesses became sacrificed to illicit passion — passion which was still natural , although illicit ! Those amours were productive of issue ; but the offspring of none has created any sensation in the world , save in the instance of Captain Garth , the son of the Princess Sophia . Relative to the mysterious birth of that individual , the secret papers left by my mother — and the existence of which is even unknown to my husband — contain some strange , some startling facts . Conceive the embarrassment — the perilous nature of the situation in which the princess was suddenly involved — when , during a journey from London to some fashionable watering - place , she found herself overtaken with the pangs of premature maternity — she , who up to that moment had managed to conceal her condition even from the attendants upon her person ! Then imagine this princess — a daughter of the sovereign of the realm — compelled to put up at a miserable road - side inn — forced to make a confidant of her lady in attendance , and obliged also to entrust her secret to the surgeon of the village where her child was born ! But you shall read the narrative , with all its details , in my private papers . "
746360	746392	746394	746395	the duchess	7385	" What opinion has your ladyship formed relative to the circumstances which led to the Bill of Pains and Penalties instituted against Queen Caroline , the spouse of George the Fourth ? "
746397	746414	746416	746417	the countess	5273	" I firmly believe that most unfortunate and most persecuted princess to have been completely innocent , "
746423	747001	746416	746417	the countess	5273	" From the first she was hateful to her husband . When the Earl of Malmsbury , who was sent to Germany to escort the Princess to England , arrived with her in London , the Prince of Wales repaired instantly to pay his respects to his intended bride . But scarcely had he set eyes on her when he conceived a feeling of ineffable dislike ; and , turning towards the Earl , he said , ' Harris,[27 ] a glass of brandy — I am ill ! ' Your grace has heard of love at first sight : here was hatred at first sight . Every thing attending that marriage was inauspicious : for if the Princess had the misfortune to make an unfavourable impression on the Prince , his Royal Highness wantonly wounded her feelings by grossly manifesting his dislike towards her on all occasions . On the bridal night he drank so deeply that he fell on a sofa in the nuptial chamber , and there slept with his clothes on . But to pass over many years , let us come to the circumstances which led to the memorable trial of Queen Caroline . During her continental travels , Baron Bergami was presented to her . He was a man of honourable character , good family , but ruined fortunes . His condition excited the compassion of the generous - hearted Caroline ; and she gave him a situation in her household . His conversation was fascinating ; and he was frequently her companion inside the travelling chariot . Perhaps an English lady would have acted with more prudence ; but your grace will remember that there is a wide distinction between our manners and customs and those of the Continent . We see improprieties in actions which foreigners view as harmless courtesies or innocent proofs of friendly interest . We also seem ready to meet suspicions of evil half - way : foreigners , with more generous frankness and candour , say , ' Evil be to him who evil thinks . ' But the marriage was hateful to King George the Fourth ; and he was determined to dissolve it . He was resolved to sacrifice his wife to his aversions . She was to be made a victim . Then commenced that atrocious subornation of perjured witnesses which gave a colour to the proceedings against the unfortunate Queen . Her slightest levities were tortured into proofs of guilt : her generosity towards Bergami was branded as an illicit passion . The witnesses made statements which proved how well they had been tutored : they over - acted their parts ; and , in their zeal to serve a master who paid them for their perjury , they deposed to more than they could possibly have known , even if the main accusation had been true . The nation was indignant — for the people , your grace , are possessed of much chivalry and noble generosity of character . Then , too , rose the portentous voices of Denman and Brougham , calling upon the hidden accuser to come forth and confront his victim . Oh ! it was a vile proceeding ; and I , as a woman — as a wife , feel my blood boiling in my veins when I think of all the foul wrongs which were heaped upon the most injured of my sex ! "
747002	747006	747008	747009	the duchess	7385	" That trial , "
747021	747042	746416	746417	the countess	5273	companion,—"that trial was certainly a dark blot on the page which records the annals of George the Fourth 's reign . "
747043	747050	747052	747053	the countess	5273	" Say rather , your grace , "
747055	747296	747052	747053	the countess	5273	" the blackest of the innumerable black deeds which characterised his existence . Before the accusation in respect to Bergami was ever thought of , a charge was concocted against that injured lady , and commissioners were appointed to investigate it . Thus , your grace perceives , her bad husband was determined to ruin her . That charge accused her of having been delivered of a male child at her abode at Blackheath ; and the affair certainly appeared suspicious at first . But how triumphantly was it met ? how readily was it refuted ? how easily was it explained ! The injured lady had taken a fancy to the infant of poor but respectable people named Archer , living in that neighbourhood ; and she had undertaken to adopt and provide for the boy . The unfortunate Princess felt the necessity of loving something — since her own child was taken from her . Thus was her goodness towards William Archer converted into a weapon wherewithal to assail her in the most tender point . Her husband 's agents circulated the most odious calumnies concerning her , and even improperly coupled her name with that of Sir Sydney Smith , the hero of Acre . But the Archer story fell to the ground ; and the Bergami scandal was subsequently propagated with a zeal which evinced the determination of George the Fourth to ruin Caroline of Brunswick . "[28
748299	748303	748294	748296	the Lord Steward	32186	" The Queen ! "
749869	749876	749878	749879	the Queen	5010	" Melbourne informed me last evening , "
749881	749915	749878	749879	the Queen	5010	" that he trembles for the safety of his Cabinet during the approaching session . The Carlton Club is particularly active ; and the Conservative party has acquired great strength during the recess . "
749916	749927	749929	749930	Prince Albert	1143	" What would be the consequence of a Ministerial defeat ? "
749932	749939	749941	749942	the Queen	5010	" A dissolution , of course , "
749944	750083	750085	750086	the Queen	5010	" I must candidly confess that I should regret to see the Conservative party succeed to power . All the principal lords and ladies of our household would be immediately changed . The Whigs , however , have certainly grown unpopular ; and there appears to be some distress in the country . The very first article on which my eyes rested when I took up this newspaper ere now , is headed ' Dreadful Suicide through Extreme Destitution . ' Beneath , in the same column , is an article entitled ' Infanticide , and Suicide of the Murderess , through Literal Starvation . ' The next column contains a long narrative which I have not had time to read , but which is headed ' Suicide through Dread of the Workhouse . ' On this page , "
750095	750154	750085	750086	the Queen	5010	" there is an article entitled ' Death from Starvation ; ' another headed ' Dreadful Condition of the Spitalfields ' Weavers ; ' a third called ' Starving State of the Paisley Mechanics ; ' a fourth entitled ' Awful Distress in the Manufacturing Districts ; ' and I perceive numerous short paragraphs all announcing similar calamities . "
750155	750166	750168	750169	the Prince	6244	" The English papers are always full of such accounts , "
750171	750198	750200	750201	the Queen	5010	" And yet I would have you know that England is the richest , most prosperous , and happiest country on the face of the earth , "
750206	750265	750085	750086	the Queen	5010	" You must not take these accounts literally as you read them . My Ministers assure me that they are greatly exaggerated . It appears — as the matter has been explained to me — that the persons who furnish these narratives are remunerated according to quantity ; and they therefore amplify the details as much as possible . "
750266	750282	750284	750285	Prince Albert	1143	" Still those accounts must be , to a certain extent , based on truth ? "
750290	750412	750284	750285	Prince Albert	1143	" Not nearly so much as you imagine . My Ministers have satisfied me on that head ; and they must know better than you . Take , for instance , the article headed ' Dreadful Condition of the Spitalfields ' Weavers . ' You may there read that the weavers are in an actual state of starvation . This is only newspaper metaphor : the writer means his readers to understand that the weavers are not so well off as they would wish to be . Perhaps they have not meat every day — perhaps only three or four times a week : but they assuredly have plenty of bread and potatoes — because bread and potatoes are so cheap ! "
750413	750442	750444	750445	Prince Albert	1143	" I thought that you intended to discountenance the importation of foreign silks , by ordering all the ladies of the Court to wear dresses of English material ? "
750451	750457	750459	750460	the Queen	5010	" Such was my intention , "
750462	750615	750459	750460	the Queen	5010	" but the ladies about me dropped so many hints on the subject , that I was compelled to rescind the command . I must confess that I was not sorry to find an excuse for so doing ; for I greatly prefer French silks and French dressmakers . But let me make an observation upon this article which is headed ' Suicide through Dread of the Workhouse . ' I spoke to the Secretary of State a few days ago upon the subject of workhouses ; and he assured me that they are very comfortable places . He declared that the people do not know when they are well off , and that they require to be managed like refractory children . He quite convinced me that all he said was perfectly correct ; and I really begin to think that the people are very obstinate , dissatisfied , and insolent . "
750616	750628	750630	750631	the Prince	6244	" They are most enthusiastic in their demonstrations towards their sovereign , "
750633	750638	750640	750640	Victoria	1154	" And naturally so , "
750642	750695	750640	750640	Victoria	1154	" Am I not their Queen ? are they not my subjects ? do I not rule over them ? All the happiness , prosperity , and enjoyments which they possess emanate from the throne . They would be very ungrateful if they did not reverence — nay , adore their sovereign . "
750696	750702	750704	750705	Prince Albert	1143	" Oh , of course ! "
750707	750728	750704	750705	Prince Albert	1143	" In Germany , any individual who exhibits the least coldness towards his sovereign is immediately marked as a traitor . "
750729	750744	750746	750747	the Queen	5010	" And in this country the Home Secretary keeps a list of disaffected persons , "
750749	750854	750746	750747	the Queen	5010	" but , thank God ! their number is very limited — at least , so I am assured . My Ministers are constantly informing me of the proofs of loyalty and devotion which the people manifest towards me . If this were a Roman Catholic nation , they would no doubt place my image next to the Virgin in their chapels ; and if it were an idolatrous country , my effigy would assuredly stand amongst the gods and goddesses . It is very pleasant , Albert , to be so much loved by my subjects — to be positively worshipped by them . "
750878	751029	750870	750871	The Queen	5010	" You remember the paragraph which the Secretary of State pointed out a few days ago : it was in the Morning Post , if you recollect . That journal — which , by the bye , circulates entirely amongst the upper servants of the aristocracy , and nowhere else — declared ' that so great is the devotion of my loyal , subjects that , were such a sacrifice necessary , they would joyfully throw themselves beneath the wheels of my state - carriage , even as the Indians cast themselves under the car of Juggernaut . '[31 ] I never in my life saw but that one number of the Post : its circulation , I am told , is confined entirely to the servants of the aristocracy ; still it seems in that instance to express the sentiments of the entire nation . You smile , Albert ? "
751030	751051	751053	751054	the Prince	6244	" I was only thinking whether the paragraph to which you have alluded , was another specimen of newspaper metaphor , "
751062	751067	751069	751070	the Queen	5010	" Not at all , "
751074	751141	751069	751070	the Queen	5010	" the Editor wrote precisely as he thought . He must know the real sentiments of the people , since he is a man of the people himself . I have been assured that he was once the head - butler in a nobleman 's family : hence his success in conducting a daily newspaper exclusively devoted to the interests and capacities of upper - servants . "
751142	751156	751158	751159	the Prince	6244	" I thought that English Editors were generally a better class of men ? "
751161	751170	751172	751173	the Queen	5010	" So they are for the most part , "
751175	751355	751172	751173	the Queen	5010	" graduates at the Universities — barristers — and highly accomplished gentlemen . But in the case of the Morning Post there seems to be an exception . We were , however , conversing upon the distress in the country — for there certainly is some little distress here and there ; although the idea of people actually dying of starvation in a Christian land is of course absurd . I am really bewildered , at times , with the reasons of , and the remedies proposed for , that distress . If I ask the Home Secretary , he declares that the people are too obstinate to understand what comfortable places the workhouses are;—if I ask the Colonial Secretary , he assures me that the people are most wilfully blind to the blessings of emigration : if I ask the Foreign Secretary , he labours to convince me that the distracted state of the East reacts upon this country ; and if I ask the Bishop of London he expresses his conviction that the people require more churches . "
751356	751371	751373	751374	the Prince	6244	" For my part , I do not like to interfere in these matters , "
751376	751387	751373	751374	the Prince	6244	" and therefore I never ask any questions concerning them . "
751388	751438	751172	751173	the Queen	5010	" And you act rightly , Albert , for you certainly know nothing of English politics . I observe by the newspapers that the country praises your forbearance in this respect . You are a Field - Marshal , and Chief Judge of the Stannaries Court — and — — "
751439	751447	751449	751450	the Prince	6244	" And a Knight of the Garter , "
751452	751462	751464	751465	the Queen	5010	" Yes — and a Learned Doctor of Laws , "
751467	751472	751464	751465	the Queen	5010	" any thing else ? "
751473	751485	751487	751488	the Prince	6244	" Several things — but I really forget them all now , "
751490	751494	751496	751497	the Queen	5010	" Never mind , "
751499	751554	751496	751497	the Queen	5010	" I intend to obtain for you higher distinctions yet . I do not like the mere title of Prince , and the style of Royal Highness : you shall be King - Consort and Your Majesty . Then , when a vacancy occurs , you must be appointed Commander - in - Chief . "
751555	751565	751567	751568	the Prince	6244	" I feel deeply grateful for your kind intentions , "
751574	751593	751567	751568	the Prince	6244	" but you are well aware that I am totally ignorant of every thing connected with the army . "
751594	751603	751605	751606	the Queen	5010	" That is of no consequence in England , "
751608	751692	751605	751606	the Queen	5010	" You will have subordinates to do your duty . I must speak to Melbourne about all this . And now , as I intend to take these steps in your behalf , pray be a little more cautious relative to your private amusements ; and let me hear of no more burying of dogs with funeral honours . That little affair of the interment of Eos at Windsor has attracted the notice of the press , I understand . It was indiscreet . "
751693	751706	751708	751709	the Prince	6244	" If I adapt my conduct entirely according to the English notions , "
751711	751729	751708	751709	the Prince	6244	" I should be compelled to give up those battues to which I am so devotedly attached . "
751730	751739	751741	751742	the Queen	5010	" We must consult Melbourne on that head , "
751887	751935	751882	751882	He	7279	" Why are you so exalted , and I so abased ? And yet your graceful person — your intelligent countenance — your handsome features , seem to fit you for such an elevated position . Nevertheless , if I had had your advantages of education — — "
752021	752030	752013	752013	he	6244	" Come forth — whoever you may be . "
752062	752067	752069	752071	his Royal Highness	31726	" Who are you ? "
752077	752088	752069	752071	his Royal Highness	31726	" what means this intrusion ? how came you hither ? "
752211	752216	752217	752217	he	6244	" I am willing , "
752220	752254	752217	752217	he	6244	" to forgive the present offence ; you shall be suffered to depart . But I warn you that a repetition of the act will lead to a severe punishment . Follow me . "
752272	752285	752287	752287	his	6244	" Conduct this lad as privately as you can from the palace , "
752291	752304	752287	752287	his	6244	" Ask him no questions — and mention not the incident elsewhere . "
753001	753008	753009	753009	he	20613	" Good evening , Mr. Vernon , "
753030	753040	753027	753027	he	20613	" I hope I have not kept you waiting . "
753041	753048	753050	753050	Vernon	1679	" Oh ! never mind that , "
753054	753063	753050	753050	Vernon	1679	" Have you any good news to communicate ? "
753064	753099	753013	753013	he	20613	" I am sorry to say that I have not . I called this morning upon the clerk of the parish church where your brother was married , and tried him in all ways . "
753100	753105	753107	753107	Vernon	1679	" And he refused ? "
753114	753118	753120	753120	Tidkins	1647	" He refused , "
753122	753146	753120	753120	Tidkins	1647	" He is timid and old ; and , after having first entertained the subject , at length backed out of it altogether . "
753147	753156	753158	753158	Vernon	1679	" Because you did not offer him enough , "
753162	753247	753158	753158	Vernon	1679	" because you did not show him gold ! You are only lukewarm in this affair : you are afraid to risk a few miserable pounds in the business . This is not the way to conduct a grand project of such a nature . It is true that I am fearfully embarrassed for funds at this moment ; but if you had acted with liberality — if we eventually succeeded — you must be well aware that my generosity would know no bounds . "
753248	753252	753254	753256	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Mr. Vernon , "
753260	753339	753254	753256	the Resurrection Man	3220	" if you have nothing better than reproaches to offer as the reward of my exertions in your behalf , we should do well to separate at once . I was not niggard in my offers to the clerk : I spread fifty golden sovereigns before him — told him to take them , and promised as much more when he had done the job . But he hesitated — reflected — and at length positively refused altogether . "
753340	753353	753355	753355	Vernon	1679	" And you really believe there is no hope in that quarter ? "
753359	753412	753414	753416	the Resurrection Man	3220	" None . If the old clerk would ever agree to serve us , he would have consented this morning . I know the man now : he is too timid to suit our purposes . But let us look calmly at the whole business , and devise another mode of proceeding , "
753418	753441	753414	753416	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You are still determined , by some means or other , to get possession of the estates of your elder brother ? "
753442	753453	753455	753455	Vernon	1679	" My resolution is even increased by every fresh obstacle , "
753457	753560	753562	753562	Vernon	1679	" I have two powerful objects to accomplish — revenge and ambition . Lord Ravensworth has treated me with a cruelty and a contempt that would goad the most meek and patient to study the means of vengeance . Our late father always intended the ready money , of which he could dispose , to come to me , because the estates were entailed upon my brother . But my father died suddenly , and intestate ; and my brother , although he well knew our parent 's intentions , grasped all — gave me nothing ! No — I am wrong , "
753572	753596	753562	753562	Vernon	1679	" he agreed to allow me five hundred pounds a - year , as a recompense for the loss of as many thousands ! "
753597	753604	753606	753608	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And you accepted the offer ? "
753610	753623	753625	753625	Vernon	1679	" I accepted it as a beggar receives alms sooner than starve , "
753627	753714	753625	753625	Vernon	1679	" I accepted it because I had nothing : I had not the means of existence . But I accepted it also as an instalment of my just due — and not as a concession on the part of his bounty . My habits are naturally extravagant : my expenses are great — I can not check myself in that respect . Thus am I perpetually obtaining advances from my brother 's agent ; and now I have not another shilling to receive until next January . "
753715	753720	753722	753724	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Nearly a year ! "
753726	753738	753722	753724	the Resurrection Man	3220	" But if you was to call on the agent — — "
753739	753742	753744	753744	Vernon	1679	" Absurd ! "
753746	753885	753744	753744	Vernon	1679	" Have I not told you that my brother believes me still to be in the East — still travelling in Turkey ? So long as he supposes me far away , I can carry on my projects in London with far greater security . In a word , it is much safer that my presence in this country should remain a profound secret . He will die shortly — he must die — he is daily , steadily parting with vitality . He is passing out of existence by a sure , a speedy , and yet an inexplicable progression of decay . Of his death , then , I am sure ; and when it shall occur , how can suspicion attach itself to me — since I am supposed to be abroad — far away ? "
753886	753899	753901	753903	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You are certain that your brother is hastening towards the grave ? "
753905	753940	753901	753903	the Resurrection Man	3220	" The great obstacle — the greatest , I mean — will be thereby removed . Suppose that Lady Ravensworth should be delivered of a boy , would it not be equally easy — — "
753941	753958	753722	753724	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Yes — it would be easy to put it out of the way by violence , "
753964	754035	753722	753724	the Resurrection Man	3220	" but , then , I should risk my neck at the same time that I gained a fortune . No — that will not do ! I could not incur a danger of so awful a nature . The infant heir to vast estates would be jealously protected — attentively watched — surrounded by all wise precautions:—no — it were madness to think of practising aught against its life . "
754036	754061	753744	753744	Vernon	1679	" Could not the same means by which — even though at a distance — you are undermining the life of your brother — — "
754062	754067	754069	754069	Vernon	1679	" No — no , "
754073	754117	754069	754069	Vernon	1679	" It is not necessary that I should explain to you the precise nature of the means by which I succeed in effecting Lord Ravensworth 's physical decay ; suffice it to state that those means could not be applied to a child . "
754118	754121	754123	754125	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Nevertheless , "
754127	754170	754123	754125	the Resurrection Man	3220	" you must have an agent at Ravensworth Park ; for if — as I suppose — your brother is dying by means of slow poison , there is some confidential creature of your own about his person to administer the drugs . "
754171	754227	753744	753744	Vernon	1679	" I have no agent at Ravensworth;—I have no confidential creature about my brother 's person;—and I have so combined my measures that Lord Ravensworth is actually committing suicide — dying by his own hand ! Another time I will expound all this to you ; for to you alone have I communicated my projects . "
754228	754237	754239	754241	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Have you not explained yourself to Greenwood ? "
754243	754271	754239	754241	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I thought you told me , the last time we met , that he knew you well — and knew also that you are in England ? "
754272	754305	754307	754307	Vernon	1679	" I was acquainted with him some four or five years ago , when he was not so prosperous as he is — or as he appears to be — at present , "
754309	754372	754307	754307	Vernon	1679	" but having been abroad since that time until my return last week , I had lost sight of him — and had even forgotten him . It was not a little provoking to run against him the very first day of my arrival in London ; and , though I endeavoured to avoid him , he persisted in speaking to me . "
754373	754388	754390	754392	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You are not afraid that he will gossip about your presence in London ? "
754394	754408	754410	754410	Vernon	1679	" He promised me most faithfully to keep the fact a profound secret , "
754412	754427	754429	754429	Tidkins	1647	" And will he not advance you a small sum for your present purposes ? "
754431	754461	754463	754463	Vernon	1679	" I called on him last evening , in consequence of the suggestion contained in your note;—I requested a loan for a particular purpose;—but he refused to oblige me , "
754469	754484	754465	754465	his	1679	" I wish that I had not so far humbled myself by asking him . "
754485	754491	754493	754493	Tidkins	1647	" No matter for that , "
754495	754631	754493	754493	Tidkins	1647	" we are wandering from our subject . Here is the substance of the whole affair:—Lord Ravensworth will soon be gathered to his fathers , as they say : but in the meantime Lady Ravensworth may have a child . If it is a daughter , you are all safe ; if it is a son you are all wrong . I do n't know how it is — I'm not superstitious — but in these matters , where a good fellow like yourself is within reach of a fortune , and whether you are to get it or not depends on the sex of an expected infant,—in such cases , I say , the card generally does turn up wrong . Now if the child should be a boy , what will you do ? "
754632	754653	754655	754655	Vernon	1679	" I can not consent to abandon the plan of bribing the clerk to destroy the leaf in the register , "
754657	754679	754655	754655	Vernon	1679	" Pshaw ! the project is bad — I told you so all along . See how the matter would stand , "
754681	754823	754655	754655	Vernon	1679	Tidkins:—"Lord Ravensworth dies and leaves , we will suppose , an infant heir — a son . Then you suddenly make your appearance , and demand proofs of your brother 's marriage . The register is searched — a leaf is missing — it is the one which contains the record of the union celebrated between Lord Ravensworth and Miss Adeline Enfield ! Would not this seem very extraordinary ? would it not create suspicions that Lord Ravensworth may not have died fairly ? No — your project , Mr. Vernon , will never do : It is baseless — shallow — childish . It is unworthy of you . If you persist in it , I shall wash my hands of the business:—if you will follow my advice , you shall be Lord Ravensworth before you are a year older . "
754856	754862	754863	754863	he	20626	" Speak , Mr. Tidkins , "
754866	754880	754863	754863	he	20626	" we have met to consult on the necessary course to be adopted . "
754881	754893	754895	754897	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Let us come , then , boldly to the point , "
754906	754958	754900	754900	his	3220	" rest patiently for the confinement of Lady Ravensworth , which , you have learnt , is expected to take place in six weeks;—if the issue is a girl , you need trouble yourself no more in the business , but calmly wait till death does its work with Lord Ravensworth . "
754959	754968	754970	754970	Vernon	1679	" And if the issue be a boy ? "
754980	754990	754992	754994	the Resurrection Man	3220	" It must be put out of the way , "
755004	755029	754992	754994	the Resurrection Man	3220	" and you may trust to me that the business shall be done in such a manner as to endanger no one 's neck . "
755030	755043	755045	755045	Vernon	1679	" You think — you imagine that it can be done — — "
755065	755075	755077	755077	Tidkins	998	" I do not speak upon thoughts and imaginings , "
755079	755117	755119	755121	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I argue on conviction . Leave the whole affair to me . I have my plan already settled — and , when the time comes , we will talk more about it . For the present , "
755139	755177	755178	755178	Vernon	1679	" have the goodness to write the name of Ravensworth at the bottom of this blank . I shall not use it until you are really Lord Ravensworth , when the signature will be your proper one . "
755190	755202	755178	755178	Vernon	1679	" It is a five - and - twenty shilling stamp . "
755203	755212	755214	755216	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Yes — to cover three thousand pounds , "
755218	755255	755178	755178	Vernon	1679	" That will not be too much for making you a peer and a rich man . Besides , I intend to advance you a matter of fifty pounds at once , for your immediate necessities . "
755256	755273	755275	755275	Vernon	1679	" And if I should happen to fail in obtaining the title and estates of Ravensworth , "
755277	755292	755275	755275	Vernon	1679	" this document would enable you to immure me in a debtor 's prison . "
755293	755296	755298	755298	Tidkins	998	" Ridiculous ! "
755302	755355	755356	755356	he	998	" In that case your name would not be Ravensworth ; and it is the name of Ravensworth which I require to this bill . As for throwing your person into a prison , what good could that do me ? A dead carcass is of more value than a living one , "
755504	755512	755494	755494	he	3220	" Golden Lane , Saint Luke 's . "
755599	755603	755622	755622	her	20644	" living statue ; "

756010	756027	756028	756028	She	29758	" of so youthful a creature having been brought to her abode for such a purpose . "
756043	756046	756028	756028	She	29758	" under twelve "
756548	756552	756547	756547	them	20692	" oyster day , "
756580	756585	756547	756547	them	20692	" boxing - day , "
757584	757595	757597	757598	the hag	29746	" So you have discovered the address of Katherine Wilmot , "
757600	757606	757597	757598	the hag	29746	" Where does she reside ? "
757607	757612	757713	757715	the old hag	29758	" No matter where , "
757618	757693	757713	757715	the old hag	29758	" it is sufficient that I can communicate with her , or bring her up to London , when it suits me . I have come now to have a full understanding with you on the subject ; and if we play our cards well , we may obtain a round sum of money from this girl — that is , supposing she is really the child of the Harriet Wilmot whom you knew . "
757694	757711	757713	757715	the old hag	29758	" There can be no doubt of it — there can be no doubt of it , "
757723	757746	757718	757718	herself	29758	" She is the daughter of that Harriet Wilmot whom I knew , and whose image sometimes haunts me in my dreams . "
757747	757757	757759	757761	the Resurrection Man	3220	" But what proofs have you of the fact ? "
757763	757794	757759	757761	the Resurrection Man	3220	" It will not suit me to take any more trouble in the matter , unless I know for certain that I am not running a wild - goose chase . "
757795	757823	757825	757827	the old hag	29758	" I shall not tell you how I came to know Harriet Wilmot seventeen years ago , nor any thing more about her than I can help , "
757830	757918	757825	757827	the old hag	29758	" I was , however , well acquainted with her — I knew all about her . With her own lips she told me her history . She was for some time engaged to be married to a young man — young at that period — at Southampton . His name was Smithers . Circumstances separated them before the realisation of their hopes and wishes ; and she came to London with her father , who soon afterwards died of a broken heart through misfortunes in business . "
757919	757923	757925	757927	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Broken heart ! "
757930	757946	757925	757927	the Resurrection Man	3220	" who ever died of a broken heart ? But never mind — go on . "
757947	757966	757968	757969	the hag	29746	" Harriet was alone in the world — an orphan — unprotected — and without friends or resources , "
757971	758044	758046	758048	the old woman	26813	" She was accordingly compelled to go out to service . A wealthy gentleman saw her , and fell in love with her — but I shall not tell you all about that ! No — I shall not tell you about that ! Harriet 's was a strange fate — a sad fate ; and I do not like to think of the part I acted in some respects towards her , "
758064	758068	758070	758072	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Go on , "
758074	758100	758070	758072	the Resurrection Man	3220	" If you have got any thing unpleasant in your memory , all the shakings of heads in the world wo n't drive it out . "
758101	758114	758116	758118	the old woman	26813	" Alack ! you speak the truth — you speak the truth , "
758120	758160	758116	758118	the old woman	26813	" It was the blackest deed I ever committed — I wish it had never occurred : it troubles me very often ; and when I can not sleep at night , I am constantly thinking of Harriet Wilmot . "
758161	758170	758172	758172	Tidkins	998	" What is all this to lead to ? "
758176	758189	758191	758192	the hag	29746	" I shall not trouble you with many more of my reflections , "
758194	758396	758191	758192	the hag	29746	" Harriet became a mother : she had a daughter , on whom she bestowed the name of Katherine . Three or four years afterwards I lost sight of her , and never beheld her more . From that time all traces of herself and her child were gone until last year , when the murder of Reginald Tracy 's housekeeper placed the name of Katherine Wilmot before the public . That name immediately struck me : the newspapers said she was sixteen years old — precisely the age that Harriet 's daughter must have been . Then the name of Smithers was mixed up in the proceedings which ensued : I saw it all — Harriet must be dead , and Smithers had adopted her child as his niece ! But , to convince myself still further , I went to the Old Bailey — I saw Katherine in the dock : you might have knocked me down with a feather , so strong was the resemblance between the young girl and her deceased mother ! I came home — I was very ill : methought I had seen the ghost of one whom I had deeply , deeply injured ! "
758397	758424	758426	758428	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And now you have so far forgotten your remorse that you are desirous to turn your knowledge of Katherine 's parentage to a good account ? "
758435	758452	758426	758428	the Resurrection Man	3220	" But how do you know that she is not well informed on that head already ? "
758453	758464	758466	758468	the old hag	29758	" She can not be — she can not be , "
758470	758536	758466	758468	the old hag	29758	" she would not bear the name of Wilmot if she was . Besides , I have since ascertained that her mother died when she was only four years old ; and therefore Katherine was too young to receive any revelation from her parent 's lips . No — no : I have good reason to believe that Katherine knows nothing of her paternal origin . "
758537	758564	758566	758568	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I am now perfectly satisfied , from all you have told me , that Katherine Wilmot is the daughter of the Harriet whom you knew , "
758570	758601	758566	758568	the Resurrection Man	3220	" and as you seem so positive that she is unaware of many important particulars concerning her birth , I will proceed in the business you have proposed to me . "
758602	758608	758610	758612	the old woman	26813	" Where is she living ? "
758614	758621	758623	758623	Tidkins	998	" If I tell you that , "
758625	758695	758623	758623	Tidkins	998	" what guarantee have I got that you will not post off alone to her , extort the purchase - money for your secrets , and chouse me out of my reglars ? Look you — I have been at the trouble and expense of finding her out — which you never could have done — and I must go halves with you in the produce of the affair . "
758696	758705	758707	758709	the old woman	26813	" So you shall — so you may , "
758711	758767	758707	758709	the old woman	26813	" But I will not speak to her in your hearing . I do n't know how it is that I have a strange superstitious awe in connexion with all that concerns Harriet Wilmot 's memory and the existence of her child . I can not help the feeling — I can not help it . "
758768	758772	758774	758776	the Resurrection Man	3220	" By Satan , "
758786	758867	758774	758776	the Resurrection Man	3220	" you are either a drivelling fool , or you are deceiving me . You entertain compunction about these Wilmots — and yet you purpose to obtain money from the girl . Now is this consistent ? Take care how you play with me ; for — if I catch you out in any of your tricks — I will hang you up to your own bedpost as readily as I would wring the neck of that damned old cat . "
758868	758882	758884	758886	the old hag	29758	" You shall see whether I will deceive you — you shall see , "
758894	758933	758884	758886	the old hag	29758	" Arrange the business as you will , so long as I may have speech of Katherine without being overheard ; but you shall be present when she pays me for the secret which I have to communicate . "
758934	758946	758948	758950	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Let that be the understanding , and I am agreeable , "
758952	758971	758948	758950	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Will it suit you to go a few miles out of town with me to - morrow . "
758972	758979	758981	758982	the hag	29746	" Is it to see Katherine ? "
758984	758998	759000	759000	Tidkins	998	" What the devil else do you think I want your company for ? "
759002	759038	759000	759000	Tidkins	998	" to take you to dine at Greenwich or Blackwall — eh ? Not quite such a fool as that ! However , to - morrow morning you may expect me at seven o'clock — — "
759039	759048	759050	759051	the hag	29746	" It is not light at that hour , "
759053	759064	759066	759068	the Resurrection Man	952	" I prefer the dusk of either morning or evening , "
759070	759169	759170	759172	The old hag	29758	" It suits me better — because I have a few enemies in London . But , as I was saying , I shall call for you at seven to - morrow morning ; a friend of mine — one Banks of Globe Town — has a covered spring - cart and a capital bit of horse - flesh . He will drive us to where we have to go , in no time . So do n't keep us waiting — as the vehicle will be at the bottom of the lane by a quarter to seven . "
759544	759561	759563	759563	Ellen	1046	" I shall really experience deep regret to leave your dwelling - place , dear Katherine , "
759578	759598	759563	759563	Ellen	1046	" for even at this season , it possesses many attractions superior to the vicinity of a great city . "
759599	759610	759612	759612	Katherine	1413	" In the warmer months it is a beautiful spot , "
759614	759637	759563	759563	Ellen	1046	" But you will not leave me to - day ? Consider — you have only been here a few hours — — "
759638	759643	759645	759645	Ellen	1046	" Since yesterday morning , "
759651	759671	759645	759645	Ellen	1046	" and in that time we have formed a friendship which may never , I hope , be interrupted . "
759672	759677	759679	759679	Katherine	1413	" Oh ! never , "
759682	759718	759679	759679	Katherine	1413	" It was so kind of you to come and find me out in my seclusion — so considerate to make me acquainted with all those wonderful events which have occurred to my benefactor — — "
759719	759727	759730	759730	Ellen	1046	" Nay — neither kind nor considerate , "
759732	759798	759730	759730	Ellen	1046	" Richard 's letter , dated from the city of Abrantani on the 10th , and received by my father the day before yesterday , enjoined him to send me to see you — to make your acquaintance — to assure myself that you are well and happy — and to communicate to you tidings which Richard feels will be welcome to all his friends . "
759799	759805	759807	759807	Katherine	1413	" Oh ! welcome indeed ! "
759813	759873	759807	759807	Katherine	1413	" How much do I owe to him — and how worthy is he of that rank which has rewarded his grand deeds ! Such a man could not long remain a humble individual : his great talents — his noble heart — his fine qualities were certain to elevate him above the sphere in which he was born . "
759874	759887	759889	759889	Ellen	1046	" And now will the name of Markham go down to posterity , "
759893	759972	759889	759889	Ellen	1046	" and the glory which Richard has thrown around it , will be to some degree shared by all who bear it . Oh ! this was prophesied to me but a little while ago;—and yet , then how far was I from suspecting that the realisation of the prediction was so near at hand , especially too , as that prediction was not uttered with any reference to Richard — but to another,—that other alluding to himself ! "
760002	760241	759992	759992	Ellen	1046	" But I was speaking of matters which are yet unknown — yet strange to you . Think no more of my observations on that topic . There are times when the soul is lost and bewildered in the contemplation of the world 's strange events and marvellous vicissitudes ; and such has often been the case with me during the last few days . It was on the 16th of January that we received the letter which imparted us the tidings of Richard 's first exploit — the capture of Estella . Oh ! how sincerely I prayed for his success — and yet I trembled for him ! My father , too , had some misgivings ; but we endeavoured to reassure each other , mutually concealing our fears . Two or three days afterwards we received the news of his triumphant entry into Villabella;—another interval of a few days , and we had a letter from him , giving us a brief account of the Battle of Piacere . Our fears were almost entirely dissipated by the tidings of this glorious achievement ; and if any doubts yet lingered , they were completely dispelled by the news of the great victory of Abrantani . Oh ! how well has he earned that coronet which now adorns his brow!—how well does that proud title of Marquis become the great , the generous , and the good ! "
760242	760263	760265	760266	Miss Wilmot	1413	" Would that his struggles were over , and that the civil war was put an end to in Castelcicala ! "
760286	760295	760297	760297	Ellen	1046	" I have no fears for the result , "
760299	760435	760297	760297	Ellen	1046	" a conqueror has he hitherto been — and a conqueror will he remain ! Heaven itself prospers him in this undertaking : the wise dispensations of Providence are apparent throughout his career in the Grand Duchy . Had the first expedition , which landed at Ossore , succeeded , there were great chiefs — Grachia and Morosino — who would have taken the lead in the State . But the enterprise failed — and those patriots were numbered with the slain . The idea of releasing from their captivity his companions in that fatal affair , led Richard to the attack of Estella . He succeeded — and he stood alone at the head of the movement . There was not a chief amongst the patriots to dispute his title to that elevated situation . "
760436	760458	760460	760460	Katherine	1413	" Yes — the finger of heaven was assuredly visible in all those circumstances which led to my benefactor 's greatness , "
760462	760514	760460	760460	Katherine	1413	" Methinks that when I see him again , I shall be strangely embarrassed in his presence:—instead of addressing him by the familiar name of Mr. Markham , my lips must tutor themselves to breathe the formal words ' My Lord , ' and ' Your Lordship ; ' and — — "
760515	760530	760532	760532	Ellen	1046	" Oh ! you wrong our noble - hearted friend — our mutual benefactor , "
760534	760568	760532	760532	Ellen	1046	" Rank and distinction — wealth and glory can not change his heart : he will only esteem them as the elements of an influence and of a power to do much good . "
760654	760668	760675	760675	he	20810	" Is this the way , young ladies , to Farmer Bennet 's ? "
760686	760690	760692	760692	Kate	1413	" It is , "
760694	760739	760692	760692	Kate	1413	" You may see the roof appearing from the other side of yonder eminence . Mr. Bennet is not , however , within at this moment : he has gone to a neighbouring village on business , and will not return till two o'clock . "
760740	760747	760754	760754	he	3220	" Then you know Farmer Bennet ? "
760796	760812	760814	760816	the detestable woman	20815	" Well , Miss — do I have the pleasure of meeting you once more ? "
760853	760859	760844	760844	she	20815	" Ah ! Miss Wilmot ! "
760860	760866	760868	760870	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Is this Miss Wilmot ? "
760889	760895	760897	760897	Kate	1413	" My name is Wilmot , "
760907	760921	760897	760897	Kate	1413	" Was it for me that your visit to the farm was intended ? "
760922	760930	760932	760934	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Neither more nor less , Miss , "
760936	760940	760941	760941	he	3220	" This person , "
760949	760958	760941	760941	he	3220	" has something important to say to you . "
760959	760970	760972	760973	the hag	29746	" Yes — and we must speak alone , too , "
760975	760978	760972	760973	the hag	29746	" No ! "
760986	761032	760980	760980	Ellen	1046	" that may not be . I am Miss Wilmot 's friend — the friend , too , of one in whom she places great confidence ; and whatever you may have to communicate to her can not be a secret in respect to me . "
761049	761052	761054	761054	Kate	1413	" Yes , "
761080	761101	761066	761066	she	1413	" yes — whatever you may wish to communicate to me must be told in the presence of my friend . "
761102	761112	761114	761116	the Resurrection Man	3220	" But the business is a most delicate one , "
761118	761128	761130	761130	Ellen	1046	" Oh ! I have no doubt of that , "
761142	761150	761152	761154	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Do you know this young lady ? "
761172	761180	761182	761183	the hag	29746	" I know that young lady well , "
761192	761203	761182	761183	the hag	29746	" I know you well,—do I not , Miss Monroe ? "
761204	761214	761216	761216	Ellen	1117	" I am not disposed to deny the fact , "
761220	761293	761216	761216	Ellen	1117	" and I can assure you that my disposition is as resolute and determined as you have always found it to be . Therefore , if you have aught to communicate to Miss Wilmot , say it quickly — or come with us to the farm , where you will be more at your ease : but , remember , I do not quit this young lady while you are with her . "
761294	761311	761313	761314	the hag	29746	" You will repent of this obstinacy , Miss — you will repent of this obstinacy , "
761316	761322	761324	761324	Ellen	1117	" It may be so , "
761326	761338	761324	761324	Ellen	1117	" nevertheless , menaces will not deter me from my purpose . "
761339	761355	761357	761358	the hag	29746	" If you thwart me , I can proclaim matters that you would wish unrevealed , "
761368	761374	761376	761378	this young lady	39501	" Act as you please , "
761390	761411	761376	761378	this young lady	39501	" Your impertinence only convinces me the more profoundly of the prudence of my resolution to remain with Miss Wilmot . "
761468	761472	761473	761473	he	998	" Miss Monroe , "
761474	761519	761434	761434	He	998	said,—"for such , I learn , is your name,—I beg of you to allow my companion a few moments ' conversation with your young friend . They need not retire a dozen yards from this spot ; and your eye can remain upon them . "
761520	761523	761525	761525	Ellen	1117	" No , "
761529	761591	761525	761525	Ellen	1117	" your companion shall have no private conference with Miss Wilmot . Miss Wilmot 's affairs are no secret to me;—she has voluntarily made me acquainted with her past history and her present condition — and she can not now wish me to remain a stranger to the object of your visit , however delicate be the nature of that business . "
761592	761604	761606	761606	Kate	1413	" I am desirous that Miss Monroe should hear your communications , "
761608	761622	761624	761626	the old hag	29758	" I will not speak to Miss Wilmot in the presence of witnesses , "
761628	761644	761646	761646	Ellen	1117	" Then we have nothing farther to prevent us from returning to the farm immediately , "
761666	761678	761680	761681	the hag	29746	" Neither need we remain here any longer , Mr. Tidkins , "
761683	761686	761688	761688	Ellen	1117	" Tidkins ! "
761708	761710	761711	761711	she	1117	homeward:—"Tidkins ! "
761722	761734	761711	761711	she	1117	" my God ! what new plot can now be contemplated ? "
761752	761759	761761	761762	Miss Wilmot	1413	" Do you know those people ? "
761773	761776	761778	761778	Ellen	1117	" Unfortunately , "
761787	761875	761778	761778	Ellen	1117	utterance,—"unfortunately I can attest that the woman whom we have just met , is the vilest of the vile ; and the mention of that man 's name has revealed to me the presence of a wretch capable of every atrocity — a villain whose crimes are of the blackest dye — an assassin whose enmity to our benefactor Richard is as furious as it is unwearied . Come , Katharine — come : hasten your steps;—we shall not be in safety until we reach the farm . "
761939	761944	761945	761945	she	1117	" My dear friend , "
761948	761975	761945	761945	she	1117	" some plot is in existence against your peace . That fearful - looking man and that horrible old woman are perfect fiends in mortal shape . "
761976	761988	761990	761990	Katharine	1413	" But what cause of enmity can they entertain against me ? "
762019	762042	761993	761993	her	1413	" I never saw them before in my life , to my knowledge ; and I certainly never can have injured them . "
762043	762088	762090	762090	Ellen	1117	" You are rich — and that is a sufficient motive to inspire the man with designs against you : you are pretty — and that is a sufficient reason for inducing the woman to spread her nets in your path . The man , "
762092	762125	762090	762090	Ellen	1117	" has more than once attempted the life of our generous benefactor Richard ; and that old hag , Katherine , is a wretch who lives upon the ruin of young females . "
762167	762225	762227	762227	Ellen	1117	observations:—"The person of the man was previously unknown to me ; but Mr. Markham had made me familiar with his name . Thus , when I heard that name breathed by his infamous companion , I recognised in him the monster of whose crimes my benefactor has related so dread a history . As for the woman , "
762235	762278	762227	762227	Ellen	1117	" she has been pointed out to me as one of those vile wretches who render cities and great towns dangerous to young females . Indeed , she once practised her arts upon me:—hence I am well aware of her true character . "
762422	762428	762430	762430	she	1452	" to cheer their spirits , "
762494	762507	762509	762509	he	1461	" Your servant , ma'am — your most obedient , young ladies , "
762523	762548	762520	762520	he	1461	" Ah ! if my eyes does n't deceive me in my old age , that 's Miss Kate Wilmot , werily and truly ! "
762549	762553	762555	762555	Katherine	1413	" Mr. Banks ! "
762591	762668	762571	762572	the undertaker	32765	" Yes , my dear — my name is , as you say , Banks — Edward Banks , of Globe Lane , London — Furnisher of Funerals on New and Economic Principles — Good Deal Coffin , Eight Shillings and Sixpence — Stout Oak , Thirty - five Shillings — Patent Funeral Carriage , One Pound Eleven — First Rate Carriage - Funeral , Mutes and Feathers , Four Pound Four — Catholic Fittings — — "
762669	762674	762676	762677	Mr. Bennet	1461	" Really , sir , "
762681	762708	762676	762677	Mr. Bennet	1461	" this is not a very pleasant subject for conversation ; and if you have come upon no other business than to recite your Prospectus — — "
762709	762720	762722	762723	Mr. Banks	1300	" A thousand apologies , sir — a thousand apologies , "
762731	762769	762771	762772	the undertaker	32765	" But whenever I see a few or a many mortal wessels gathered together , I always think that the day must come when they 'll be nothink more than blessed carkisses and then , Mr. Bennet , "
762789	762815	762771	762772	the undertaker	32765	" how pleasant to the wirtuous feelings must it be to know where to get the funeral done on the newest and most economic principles . "
762816	762825	762827	762828	the farmer	13679	" Katherine , do you know this person ? "
762841	762858	762827	762828	the farmer	13679	" I have seen him three or four times at Mr. Smithers ' house in London , "
762863	762881	762827	762828	the farmer	13679	" but Mr. Banks well knows that I never exchanged ten words with him in my life . "
762882	762893	762895	762896	Mr. Bennet	1461	" Then you do not come to see Miss Wilmot ? "
762903	762910	762912	762912	Banks	1300	" No , sir — no , "
762919	763011	763013	763013	he	1300	" Did you not perceive , sir , that I was quite took at a non - plush when I set my wenerable eyes on the blessed countenance of that charming gal ? But pardon me , sir — pardon me , if I am someot long in coming to the pint:—it is , however , my natur ' to ramble when I reflects on the pomps and wanities of this wicked world ; and natur ' is natur , ' sir , after all — is it not , ma'am ? "
763026	763036	763038	763038	her	1452	" I really do not understand you , sir , "
763061	763097	763099	763100	the farmer	13679	" Now , sir , will you have the goodness to explain the nature of your business with me — since it is with me , no doubt , that you have business to transact ? "
763118	763136	763138	763138	Ellen	1117	" Something tells me that this man 's visit bears reference to our adventure of the morning , "
763142	763160	763161	763161	Katherine	1413	" Do not offer to leave the room : let us hear all he has to say . "
763182	763196	763198	763199	the undertaker	32765	" My business is n't to be explained in a moment , sir , "
763201	763213	763198	763199	the undertaker	32765	" and I must beg your patience for a little while . "
763214	763218	763220	763221	the farmer	13679	" Go on , "
763265	763276	763278	763279	Mr. Banks	1300	" You 're in mourning , ma'am , I see , "
763286	763317	763278	763279	Mr. Banks	1300	" Ah ! I remember — that wexatious affair of the Rector of Saint David 's . Pray , ma'am , who undertook the funeral of your blessed defunct sister ? "
763318	763321	763323	763324	Mrs. Bennet	1452	" Sir ! "
763332	763380	763382	763385	this most disagreeable visitor	20872	" No offence , ma'am — no offence . Only I should like it to be known in these here parts that Edward Banks — of Globe Lane , London , undertakes on new and economic principles , and does n't mind distances . S'pose , sir , "
763392	763424	763382	763385	this most disagreeable visitor	20872	" s'pose you come to me some fine morning and says , ' Banks , ' says you , ' my dear wife has just become a blessed defunct — — ' "
763425	763431	763433	763434	Mr. Bennet	1461	" This is too much ! "
763441	763457	763433	763434	Mr. Bennet	1461	" Have you , or have you not , any business to engage my attention ? "
763458	763474	763476	763476	Banks	1300	" I 'm coming to the pint — I'm coming to the pint this moment , "
763478	763506	763507	763508	the undertaker	32765	" Pray sit down for a few minutes — I sha n't ingross much more of your wallyable time ; for time really is wallyable in this sublunary speer;"—and
763536	763640	763515	763517	worthy Mrs. Bennet	1452	" When we look around us , and behold how many benighted creeturs lives in total recklessness for the futur'—without putting by in an old stocking or any where else a single penny towards buying 'em a decent coffin — it 's enough to make one 's hair stand on end . But I see you are growing impatient , sir:—well — perhaps my feelings does carry me away . Still I do n't mean no harm . Howsomever — business is business , as coffins is coffins , or carkisses is carkisses ; and so here 's to business in a jiffy . "
763729	763997	763718	763718	he	1300	" There is dooties which we owe to heaven — and there is dooties which we owe to our fellow - creeturs . To heaven , ma'am , we owes a obligation of wirtue : to our fellow - creeturs we owes respect and decency when they 're no more . Wirtues , ma'am , is like the white nails on a black - cloth covered coffin : the more there is of 'em , the stronger is the coffin , and the better it looks . Wices , ma'am , is like the knots in a common deal coffin : the more there is of 'em , the veaker is the coffin , and the wuss it looks . I 'm now a - going to show you , ma'am — and you , too , sir — and you also , young ladies — a object of the deepest interest to us poor mortal wessels . I 've wrapped it up in this wise , 'cause I 've paytented it , and this is the only model I 've got . When once it 's generally known , the whole world will thank me for the inwention ; and posterity will remember with gratitude the name of Banks of Globe Lane — Furnisher of Funerals on New and Economic Principles . You see , the parcel is gettin ' smaller and smaller—'cause the blessed object was as well wrapped up as a young babby . However — here 's the last fold:—off with the paper — and there 's the concentrating focus of all interest ! "
764075	764110	764068	764069	the farmer	13679	" I have already put up with your insolence too long . What does this unwarrantable intrusion upon my privacy mean ? Speak , sir : have you any thing to say to me ? "
764111	764122	764124	764125	the undertaker	32765	" I am now coming to the pint at length , "
764134	764139	764140	764140	he	32765	" In one word , "
764155	764176	764140	764140	he	32765	pencil,—"in one word , I want you and your family to let me put down each of your names — — "
764177	764181	764183	764183	Bennet	1452	" For what ? "
764187	764203	764183	764183	Bennet	1452	" For a Paytent Silk - covered Silver - nailed Indestructible Wood - seasoned Coffin , "
764209	764224	764183	764183	Bennet	1452	" It 's warranted to keep as good as new till you want it . "
764277	764291	764269	764269	Katherine	1413	" What have you done , Mr. Banks ? Mrs. Bennet is fainting ! "
764341	764346	764348	764349	the farmer	13679	" Water , Katherine!—quick ! "
764453	764469	764470	764470	Banks	1300	" One moment — only one moment — as you value the memory of your deceased mother,"—whispered
764488	764533	764481	764481	he	1300	" Take this note — read it in private — its contents deeply concern you and your blessed defunct parent . If you breathe a word concerning it to a soul you will for ever lose the opportunity of knowing who was your father . "
764674	764680	764682	764683	the farmer	13679	" Where is that scoundrel ? "
764700	764705	764682	764683	the farmer	13679	" He is gone , "
764726	764729	764731	764731	Bennet	1452	" Gone ! "
764733	764755	764731	764731	Bennet	1452	" But it is better that he should have gone — or I might be tempted to do him a mischief . "
764756	764766	764768	764768	Ellen	1117	" That man came hither with some sinister design , "
764770	764791	764768	764768	Ellen	1117	" From the first moment of his appearance , my suspicions associated his visit with the adventure of the morning . "
764792	764800	764802	764803	the farmer	13679	" But what object could he have ? "
764805	764818	764802	764803	the farmer	13679	" He seemed only anxious to intrude himself as long as possible . "
764819	764833	764835	764835	Ellen	1117	" Perhaps he was waiting for an opportunity to speak to Katherine alone , "
764837	764847	764835	764835	Ellen	1117	" He certainly appeared to be talking against time . "
764848	764854	764856	764856	Katherine	1413	" Yes , dear friends , "
764872	764953	764856	764856	Katherine	1413	" that man did desire to speak to me alone — and he succeeded in his object . Pardon me if for a few moments I hesitated whether to obey his solemn injunction of silence , or to communicate the incident to you who wish me well . But the words which he spoke , and the earnestness of his manner , bewildered me . It however only required a short interval of sober reflection to teach me my duty . "
764979	764992	764994	764994	Ellen	1117	" You have acted prudently in revealing these particulars , dear Kate , "
764996	765026	764994	764994	Ellen	1117	" A man who is compelled to effect his purposes by such low devices as those employed by him who has just left us , can not mean well . "
765027	765037	765039	765040	Farmer Bennet	1687	" Let us hear the contents of the letter , "
765042	765056	765039	765040	Farmer Bennet	1687	" we may then , perhaps , see more clearly into the mystery . "
765057	765063	765065	765065	Kate	1413	" Read it , Ellen , "
765067	765082	765065	765065	Kate	1413	" I must confess to a profound curiosity to become acquainted with its contents . "
765095	765251	765083	765083	Ellen	1117	" Silence and secrecy,—if you respect the memory of your deceased mother ! Be not deluded by the advice of Miss Monroe , who has her own reasons for prejudicing you against me . I am well acquainted with all the particulars of your birth:—I can impart facts that it behoves you to learn . You will bitterly repent any distrust in this matter . Have you no inclination to hear more concerning your mother 's history than you can possibly now know ? would you not go far , and sacrifice much , to glean something with regard to your father ? This evening — at seven precisely — I shall be at the foot of the hill where I met you just now . If you come alone , you will learn much that nearly and deeply concerns you : if you appear accompanied by a soul , my lips will remain sealed . "
765259	765260	765254	765254	YOU	20900	" "
765276	765282	765265	765265	my	0	" said Ellen , indignantly , "
765332	765340	765311	765311	I	0	" Katherine glanced inquiringly towards the farmer . "
765354	765362	765352	765352	Kate	1413	" said he , after a pause ; "
765412	765631	765632	765632	You	20905	" This project was approved of even by the timid Mrs. Bennet ; and Katherine Wilmot anxiously awaited the coming of the appointed hour . The evening was calm , fresh , and dry : the heavens were covered with stars ; and objects were visible at a considerable distance . A few minutes before the wished - for hour , Katherine , Ellen , and the farmer reached the hill at the foot of which was the place of appointment . Then Kate left them and proceeded alone , while her two friends hastened by a circuitous route to gain a clump of trees which would enable them to remain concealed within a distance of fifty yards of the spot where Kate was to meet the old woman . The young girl pursued her way — her heart palpitating with varied emotions,—vague alarm , exalted hope , and all the re - awakened convictions of her orphan state . She reached the foot of the hill , and in a few minutes beheld a human form emerging , as it were , from the obscurity at a distance — the dim outline gradually defining itself into a positive shape , and at length showing the figure of the old woman whom she had seen in the morning . "
765643	765657	765641	765641	Miss	20906	" said the hag , as she approached the timid and trembling girl . "
765678	765763	765668	765668	me	0	" Then Kate turned towards the moon , and parted the light chesnut hair : which clustered around her countenance ; so that a pure flood of silvery lustre streamed on all the features of that sweetly interesting face — a sight too hallowed for the foul - souled harridan to gaze upon ! It was as if the veil of the Holy of Holies , in the Jewish temple , were lifted before some being fresh from the grossest pollutions of the world . "
765770	765775	765776	765776	You	20905	" murmured the hag . "
765814	765815	765798	765799	Ellen Monroe	1117	" "
765825	765831	765818	765818	you	0	" inquired Katherine , mildly . "
765847	765848	765818	765818	you	0	" "
765853	765858	765818	765818	you	0	" said the hag , "
765890	765891	765894	765894	her	3173	" "
765912	765922	765894	765894	her	3173	" replied Kate , in a deeply plaintive tone . "
766146	766156	766177	766177	her	27004	" continued Kate , tears trickling down her cheeks , "
766371	766372	766373	766373	Your	0	" "
766382	766388	766380	766380	Miss	20918	" said the old woman . "
766409	766410	766389	766390	Your mother	3173	" "
766422	766449	766452	766452	I	0	" exclaimed Katherine , forgetting , in the enthusiasm of her filial , but orphan , love , all her late repugnance to that old woman : "
766568	766574	766575	766575	you	0	" added Kate , suddenly ; "
766601	766602	766596	766596	you	0	" "
766611	766616	766605	766605	I	0	" was the answer : "
766625	766626	766619	766619	her	27004	" "
766632	766657	766629	766629	she	27004	" demanded Katherine , trembling at the question she thus put , for fear the reply should not be as she would wish it . "
766670	766675	766663	766663	she	27004	" said the hag : "
766693	766694	766695	766696	Poor mother	3391	" "
766698	766709	766695	766696	Poor mother	3391	" murmured the young girl , with a profound sob : "
766753	766754	766744	766744	I	0	" "
766771	766777	766744	766744	I	0	" answered the old woman ; "
766804	766858	766864	766864	you	0	" The hag hesitated:—yes , even she , with her soul so hardened in the tan - pits of vice , as to be on all other occasions proof against the dews of sympathy,—even she hesitated , as if softened by the ingenuous and holy outpourings of that young orphan 's filial love . "
766869	766873	766864	766864	you	0	" exclaimed Katherine ; "
766897	766994	766887	766887	you	0	" As Katherine entertained not the slightest recollection of her father , all her thoughts had ever been fixed on the memory of her mother;—but when she coupled the two names together — when she found her lips pronouncing the sacred denominations of father and mother in the same breath , there arose in her soul such varied and overpowering emotions that she dissolved into a violent agony of weeping . But that efflux of tears relieved the surcharged heart of the orphan ; and , composing herself as quickly as she could , she exclaimed , "
767024	767025	767015	767015	you	39658	" "
767045	767051	767060	767060	she	3173	" inquired the old hag . "
767078	767082	767060	767060	she	3173	" answered Katherine . "
767093	767094	767060	767060	she	3173	" "
767105	767109	767097	767097	I	0	" exclaimed Katherine : "
767187	767191	767147	767149	my medical attendant	14924	" continued Katherine , "
767252	767257	767258	767258	Markham	874	" added the orphan . "
767262	767275	767276	767276	she	14934	" repeated the hag , as if sorely troubled by some reminiscence ; "
767306	767307	767303	767304	Mr. Markham	874	" "
767317	767321	767303	767304	Mr. Markham	874	" replied Kate ; "
767398	767399	767394	767395	Richard Markham	874	" "
767414	767421	767422	767422	she	1117	" said the hag , hastily : "
767438	767444	767448	767450	Mr. Richard Markham	874	" she continued in a musing tone,—"and
767458	767459	767448	767450	Mr. Richard Markham	874	" "
767470	767474	767468	767468	him	874	" ejaculated Katherine . "
767592	767593	767579	767579	he	874	" "
767603	767618	767600	767600	I	0	" said the old woman , scarcely able to subdue a chuckle of delight . "
767634	767635	767600	767600	I	0	" "
767653	767657	767650	767650	you	8916	" exclaimed Katherine . "
767695	767696	767729	767729	you	20956	" "
767714	767719	767705	767705	I	0	" returned the hag . "
767752	767770	767778	767778	he	20957	" and here the old woman cast a rapid glance around , and lowered her voice to a whisper,—"that
767805	767806	767790	767790	He	20957	" "
767811	767815	767790	767790	He	20957	" said Katherine : "
767827	767828	767829	767829	I	0	" "
767858	767864	767853	767853	you	20960	" returned the old woman . "
767893	767894	767889	767889	he	20957	" "
767901	767905	767889	767889	he	20957	" asked Katherine . "
767930	767931	767917	767917	you	0	" "
767942	767947	767917	767917	you	0	" said the hag . "
767965	767966	767940	767940	Miss	20963	" "
767972	767985	767968	767968	I	0	" interrupted Katherine , unable to subdue a tone expressive of contempt . "
768078	768079	768059	768059	you	0	" "
768089	768098	768080	768080	I	0	" was the old woman 's ready reply . "
768127	768128	768119	768119	I	0	" "
768136	768154	768156	768156	him	3239	" asked Katherine , wearied by this mercenary trading in matters which to her appeared so sacred . "
768180	768185	768177	768178	Reginald Tracy	1354	" exclaimed the hag . "
768190	768196	768177	768178	Reginald Tracy	1354	" said Kate , impatiently . "
768208	768213	768199	768199	I	0	" was the answer ; "
768252	768253	768233	768233	I	0	" "
768261	768271	768272	768272	I	0	" said Kate , after a moment 's hesitation . "
768378	768514	768362	768362	your	0	" There was a temporary pause:—the old woman seemed to be reflecting upon the orphan 's words ; and the young girl herself was rapidly conjecturing of what nature the promised revelations could be . But how vain were all her attempts to assign a satisfactory solution to that enigma which the hag , like some horrible sphynx , had set before her ! During this prolonged interview the early loveliness of the evening had yielded to one of those sudden variations peculiar to our island - climate at that season of the year:—the sky had become overcast — the moon no longer poured forth a flood of sweet silver lustre to light up the innocent countenance of the maiden , or to mock with its chaste halo the wrinkled expression of the foul hag . "
768528	768536	768539	768539	he	20972	" said the old woman at length . "
768558	768562	768539	768539	he	20972	" answered Katherine . "
768633	768634	768635	768638	The Marquis of Estella	1610	" "
768640	768648	768651	768651	he	1610	" exclaimed the hag , in astonishment : "
768662	768663	768657	768657	he	1610	" "
768682	768684	768657	768657	he	1610	" inquired Katherine;—"those
768689	768690	768657	768657	he	1610	" "
768702	768707	768696	768696	I	0	" said the hag . "
768750	768751	768737	768738	a Marquis	19418	" "
768766	768771	768774	768774	Miss	27067	" interrupted the hag . "
768826	768827	768821	768821	you	20975	" "
768841	768852	768855	768855	you	0	" replied Katherine , in a hasty and timid whisper . "
768898	768899	768902	768902	Miss	20987	" "
768906	768918	768902	768902	Miss	20987	" said the hag , in a subdued but earnest tone : "
768925	768960	768919	768919	I	0	" Then they both held their breath;—but all was still — not a sound met their ears , save the low murmur of the breeze which had sprung up within the last few minutes . "
768965	768971	768919	768919	I	0	" observed the old woman . "
768979	768980	768975	768975	you	0	" "
768988	768990	768975	768975	you	0	" returned Kate:—"you
769030	769031	769032	769032	I	0	" "
769040	769055	769036	769036	I	0	" interrupted the old woman ; and after a short pause , she added , "
769214	769215	769197	769198	that man	3239	" "
769226	769239	769197	769198	that man	3239	" observed Katherine , considerably relieved by the old woman 's explanation , "
769257	769258	769245	769246	Miss Monroe	1117	" "
769261	769267	769245	769246	Miss Monroe	1117	" answered the old woman ; "
769313	769314	769307	769308	Miss Monroe	1117	" "
769319	769323	769317	769317	you	0	" said Kate . "
769386	769387	769390	769391	young lady	8916	" "
769395	769401	769390	769391	young lady	8916	" answered the old woman . "
769412	769421	769390	769391	young lady	8916	" she added , as a sudden thought struck her,—"except
769455	769456	769457	769457	I	0	" "
769468	769474	769460	769460	he	2092	" said Katherine , indignantly ; "
769498	769499	769504	769504	Miss	21003	" "
769506	769743	769504	769504	Miss	21003	" returned the hag , apparently well pleased with the resolute manner of the young orphan . They then separated . The old woman went one way ; and Katherine proceeded direct to the clump of trees where Ellen and the farmer were concealed;—for it was now so dark that there was no fear of the direction she took being observed . It may be naturally supposed that Ellen and Mr. Bennet were deeply anxious to be made acquainted with the particulars of an interview concerning which they had some few misgivings . On the return of the trio to the farm - house , they found Mrs. Bennet very uneasy on Kate 's account . The appearance of the young maiden reassured the good - hearted woman ; and Katherine then gave a detailed account of all that had passed between herself and the hag . The impression produced was , that there was really a legitimate foundation for the old woman 's proceedings , and that she was actually possessed of secrets touching Kate 's parentage . The agreement that the recompense was only to be awarded to her after she had made the promised communications , was considered a proof of good faith ; and Kate 's promise to supply the sum demanded in the first instance to satisfy the avarice of the Resurrection Man , met with the approval of her friends . "
769750	769754	769755	769755	I	0	" said Kate , "
769777	769778	769775	769775	Ellen	1117	" "
769785	769790	769791	769792	Mr. Wharton	1458	" observed the farmer . "
769935	770636	770637	770637	I	0	" It is needless to say that Katherine expressed her gratitude to Mr. Bennet for his goodness ; and Ellen readily promised to stay at the farm for a day or two longer , until the pending mysteries should be cleared up . Mr. Bennet moreover undertook to call at Markham Place , with a note from Ellen to relieve Mr. Monroe of any anxiety which he might feel on her account , as her absence from home would be protracted beyond the time originally contemplated . The two young ladies had now retired to the bed - chamber which Kate occupied at the farm , and which Ellen shared with her during her visit . The respective characters of those two charming creatures were then incidentally contrasted and powerfully set forth , each in its peculiar phase , by means of occurrences apparently trivial to a degree , but which were nevertheless significant in the eyes of those who closely observed the nature of the human mind . While Ellen was disrobing herself , she stood , in all the pride of her glorious beauty , before the mirror ; in the reflection of which she also arranged her long , luxuriant hair previously to retiring to rest . But Katherine , in the semi - obscurity of the remotest corner , laid aside her vestment ; nor did she once think of approaching the glass . Whence arose this discrepancy,—this pride on the one hand , and this bashfulness on the other ? It was that Ellen had been placed in those circumstances which had taught her the value and led her to appreciate the extent of her almost matchless charms:—her lovely countenance had served as a copy , and her exquisitely modelled form as a pattern for artists and sculptors;—during her brief dramatic career , she had been the object of unceasing adulation;—and when she forced Greenwood to espouse her , the splendour of her beauty had disarmed him of the resentment which he would otherwise have experienced in being compelled to sacrifice for her all his hopes of a brilliant matrimonial alliance . Hers was the pride of a loveliness which had produced her bread in the hour of her bitter need,—which was perpetuated in great works of art,—which had elicited the heart - felt admiration of many suitors of rank and name,—and which was still in all the freshness of health and youth . Still that pride was never obtrusive — not even conspicuous ; for it was attempered by a natural generosity , an innate loftiness of soul which rendered her as adorable for her disposition as she was desirable for her beauty . Katherine had long languished in a condition which compelled her to retire from observation . While she dwelt with the late executioner , she was glad to be able to shroud herself from public view . She was always neat and cleanly from principle , but not from pride . The germinations of self - complacency had been checked in their nascent state , though not completely obliterated ; and now , if they were slightly expanding in the genial atmosphere of the improved circumstances which surrounded her , it was with a legitimate growth , such as no female mind should remain unacquainted with . For a certain degree of proper pride is necessary to woman,—to preserve her self - esteem , and to maintain her soul so happily poised that it may not fall into over - weening confidence on the one side , nor into an awkward and repulsive reserve on the other . That chamber - scene would have made a fine and deeply interesting subject for the pencil of the artist , who would have delighted to shadow forth the variety of the female character,—here the glorious loveliness of the wife who dared not avow that sacred name,—there the retiring beauty of the young virgin . But Katherine had not altogether escaped the influence of that blind deity who exercises so important a control over the destinies of us mortals . How this happened we must leave her to describe in her own artless manner . "
770645	770671	770637	770637	I	0	" said Ellen , as she stood combing her long and silky hair , on which a lamp 's reflection in the mirror shed a bright glory,—"I

770777	770782	770775	770775	Ellen	1117	" was the reply : "
770794	770803	770789	770789	I	0	" added Katherine , with some little hesitation . "
770817	770821	770808	770808	you	1413	" exclaimed Ellen ; "

771205	771213	771200	771200	you	1413	" returned the young wife , laughing ; "

771247	771251	771233	771233	I	0	" said Katherine ; "
771259	771277	771228	771228	your	1413	" And she hesitated,—suffused with blushes even in the nook whither Ellen 's eyes were not directed ! "
771282	771286	771228	771228	your	1413	" exclaimed Ellen . "

772702	772703	772694	772694	I	0	" "
772721	772726	772727	772727	I	0	" continued the maiden . "
772897	772898	772887	772887	I	0	" "
772908	772980	772981	772981	I	0	" said Ellen , laughing , as she threw herself , half undressed , into an easy chair , and began to unlace the boots which enclosed her pretty feet . Katherine had emerged from her nook , and was sitting on the side of the bed which was farthest removed from Ellen ; and there , veiling her blushes behind the curtain , the young maiden continued her artless narrative . "
772988	772992	772981	772981	I	0	" she said : "
773176	773177	773172	773174	a polished gentleman	21074	" "
773182	773186	773187	773187	He	2298	" said Ellen . "
773193	773194	773187	773187	He	2298	" "
773204	773214	773195	773195	He	2298	" answered Katherine , with the most ingenuous seriousness . "
773256	773257	773250	773250	he	2298	" "
773266	773270	773259	773259	you	0	" exclaimed Ellen . "
773305	773306	773307	773307	I	0	" "
773314	773322	773307	773307	I	0	" answered Katherine , with a sigh . "
773439	773440	773436	773436	him	2298	" "
773452	773468	773449	773449	he	2298	" asked Ellen , surprised by the thoughtful seriousness of her young friend 's manner . "
773477	773481	773472	773472	me	0	" exclaimed Katherine . "
773496	773497	773489	773489	He	2298	" "
773514	773518	773512	773512	Kate	1413	" said Ellen . "
773809	774088	774093	774093	Katherine	1413	" The tender interest of the subject had so completely absorbed all other ideas in the mind of Katherine , that — no longer under the restraint of the extreme bashfulness which had driven her into the obscure part of the chamber in order to lay aside her vesture — she had emerged from the concealment of the curtain , and gradually approached nearer and nearer towards Ellen , while the latter was affectionately offering her counsel . The scene was now a most touching one . In the large arm - chair reclined the young wife , her luxuriant hair , not yet arranged for repose , flowing in shining waves over her ivory shoulders , and forming a dark curtain behind her arching neck , the dazzling whiteness and graceful contour of which were thus enhanced with an effect truly enchanting;—while a stray curl of the glossy hair , detached from the mass behind , and more fortunate than its companions , fell on the glowing bosom which was without shame revealed in the sanctity of that chamber . And , standing meekly before the young wife,—with downcast eyes and blushing cheeks,—was the young virgin,—her white arms supporting the loosened garments over her bosom in that sweet attitude of modesty which so many great masters have loved to delineate in their marble representations of female beauty . It seemed as if Venus , the Queen of Love , were enthroned in the voluptuous negligence of the boudoir , and had suddenly assumed a demeanour befitting her sovereign sway , while she tutored one of her attendant Graces in some lesson whose importance demanded that unusual seriousness . "
774095	774105	774093	774093	Katherine	1413	" added Ellen , after a moment 's pause , "
774140	774141	774142	774142	I	0	" "
774167	774200	774157	774157	I	0	" returned Kate ; and , yielding to the generous emotions of friendship , she threw herself on the bosom of her whom she had made the confidant of her young love . "
774216	774224	774202	774202	you	1413	" said Ellen , embracing her affectionately . "
774237	774510	774234	774235	dear Ellen	1117	" replied the maiden , weeping from emotions of gratitude and love . Human nature has no essence more pure,—the world knows nothing more chaste,—heaven has endowed the mortal heart with no feeling more holy , than the nascent affection of a young virgin 's soul . The warmest language of the sunny south is too cold to shadow forth even a faint outline of that enthusiastic sentiment . And God has made the richest language poor in the same respect , because the depths of hearts that thrill with love 's emotions are too sacred for the common contemplation . The musical voice of Love stirs the source of the sweetest thoughts within the human breast , and steals into the most profound recesses of the soul , touching chords which never vibrated before , and calling into gentle companionship delicious hopes till then unknown ! Yes — the light of a young maiden 's first love breaks dimly but beautifully upon her as the silver lustre of a star glimmers through a thickly - woven bower ; and the first blush that mantles her cheek , as she feels the primal influence , is faint and pure as that which a rose - leaf might cast upon marble . But how rapidly does that light grow stronger , and that flush deeper,—until the powerful effulgence of the one irradiates every corner of her heart , and the crimson glow of the other suffuses every feature of her countenance . On the ensuing morning Farmer Bennet departed early for London . After breakfast , Ellen said , with a significant smile : "
774534	774572	774573	774574	Mr. Bennet	1461	" Katherine blushed , and then smiled also ; but she offered no objection to the proposed walk . The toilette of the young ladies was soon complete ; and they sallied forth on their little excursion . "
774583	774587	774573	774574	Mr. Bennet	1461	" observed Ellen . "
774638	774639	774636	774636	Richard	874	" "
774648	774652	774644	774644	I	0	" said Katherine . "
774661	774674	774656	774656	you	1413	" she added in a tremulous tone , and with downcast eyes . "
774682	774688	774656	774656	you	1413	" answered Ellen , laughing . "
774826	774827	774828	774828	Ellen	1117	" "
774832	774847	774830	774830	Ellen	1117	" murmured Kate , suddenly ; and she caught her companion by the arm . "
774859	774865	774857	774857	yourself	1413	" was the rapid reply . "
774888	775130	774877	774877	he	21086	" And , in effect , a handsome young man,—with a dark complexion , fine and expressive eyes , and a graceful figure,—was advancing in the opposite direction . But he came slowly , as if anxious to keep some favourite object as long in view as possible ! How the pulse of the maiden 's young heart quickened , as she beheld her unknown lover approaching . And now the handsome stranger came near:—and Katherine drew close to her companion , as the timid fawn relies for protection on the stately deer . The look of the stranger was cast for a moment upon Ellen ; but not the bright glance of her eye — nor the rich colouring of her cheeks , framed as they were in masses of glossy hair — nor that symmetry of swelling bust , delicate waist , and matchless proportions of a finely - moulded form,—not this assemblage of charms induced the stranger to dwell for more than an instant on Katherine 's companion . No:—it was to Katherine herself that his eyes reverted with adoring glance ; and though he gazed fixedly upon the retiring maiden , yet there was something so respectful in his manner , that it was impossible to take offence at it . He made way for the two ladies , and raised his hat as they passed . Katherine returned the salutation without turning her eyes towards him . "
775138	775158	775160	775160	he	21080	" observed Ellen , when they were at such a distance as to incur no danger of being overheard ; "
775241	775556	775557	775557	I	0	" We need not record the conversation that ensued : the reader does not require to be informed that its principal topic was the love of the young maiden — a theme on which she was naturally pleased to speak , and in the discussion of which Ellen indulged her;—not , however , with the view of fanning the flame of incipient passion ; but with the affectionate motive of warning her against the encouragement of hopes which might never be fulfilled . The walk was prolonged until two o'clock , when the young ladies retraced their steps to the farm . Mr. Bennet had not yet returned from London : dinner was however served up . The fresh air had given Ellen an appetite ; but Katherine ate little , and was somewhat pensive . Indeed , the maiden had sufficient to engage the meditation of her young mind . The evident impression which the handsome stranger had made upon her , and the hope that evening would bring her the much - desired information relative to her parents , divided her thoughts . But of what nature would the old woman 's secrets prove ? in what manner were they to be a source of comfort to her ? It will be remembered that Smithers had made her acquainted with certain particulars relative to her mother ; and the sad inference had been that Katherine was of illegitimate birth . Would the tendency of the old woman 's communications be to clear up this mystery in a manner satisfactory to the young maiden ? As yet all was doubt and uncertainty ; and conjecture was vain ! It was about four o'clock when the farmer made his appearance . He entered the parlour , where Ellen , Katharine , and Mrs. Bennet were sitting , with a countenance expressive of supreme satisfaction . "
775567	775571	775564	775565	young ladies	30625	" he exclaimed ; "
775594	775595	775600	775600	him	874	" "
775602	775615	775600	775600	him	874	" ejaculated Ellen and Kate , as it were in one breath . "
775621	775626	775600	775600	him	874	" said the farmer . "
775637	775640	775632	775633	Mr. Monroe	885	Miss,"—addressing Ellen ; "
775653	775677	775632	775633	Mr. Monroe	885	" Ellen hastily tore open her father 's note , and began to read its contents aloud : — January 29th , 1841 . "
775792	775897	775787	775790	the Regent of Castelcicala	19579	" Nothing more is known at present ; but this is enough not only to reassure us all — but to fill our hearts with joy . My blood glows in my veins , old as I am , when I think of Richard 's grand achievements . To what a proud height has he raised himself — second only to a sovereign ! As I looked forth from the casement ere now , and beheld the two trees on the hill - top , I could not avoid a sorrowful reflection concerning Eugene . What can have become of him ? I — — "
775898	775908	775910	775910	Katherine	1413	" Heavens ! dearest Ellen , are you ill ? "
775921	775941	775910	775910	Katherine	1413	" No , Kate : it is nothing ! The abruptness with which we have received these tidings — — "
775942	775949	775951	775951	Katherine	1413	" Yes — you are unwell , "
775973	775981	775982	775982	she	1046	" I am better now , Kate , "
775985	775997	775982	775982	she	1046	" Do you terminate the perusal of my father 's letter . "
776022	776107	776108	776108	I	0	" I fear that he will not be enabled to tell so glorious a tale as his younger brother,—even if the appointment be really kept on his part ! But enough of that . You speak of bringing Miss Wilmot , to pass a few days at the Place . I entirely approve of the project , if the excellent people with whom she is living , and of whom Richard has spoken to us so highly , be willing to part with her . "
776460	776474	776448	776448	I	0	" I write this long letter while Mr. Bennet partakes of some refreshment . "
776498	776845	776496	776496	Ellen	1046	" & c. & c. It is unnecessary to state that the news from Montoni diffused the most lively joy amongst the party assembled in the parlour of the farm - house . Ellen speedily recovered her usual flow of excellent spirits , and expressed her sincere satisfaction at that remarkable elevation on the part of Richard which had excited the enthusiasm of her father . Mr. and Mrs. Bennet offered no objection to the proposal that Kate should pay a visit to Markham Place : on the contrary , though grieved to part with her , they considered that change of scene could not do otherwise than benefit her . And now the appointed hour for the meeting with the old woman drew near ; and Mr. Bennet provided Kate with the necessary funds for her purpose . Shortly before seven , the farmer ( provided with a brace of loaded pistols ) and Ellen repaired to the same hiding - place which they had occupied on the preceding evening ; and , with a beating heart , Katherine hastened to the spot where she expected to encounter one who had promised to reveal secrets so nearly concerning her . The old woman did not , however , make her appearance . The minutes passed slowly away — and still she came not . Katherine 's anxiety was intense . Half an hour had elapsed : still there was no sign of the hag . The young maiden waited until past eight o'clock ; and at length she suddenly perceived two persons advancing towards her at a little distance . For a moment she felt afraid ; but the farmer 's voice speedily reassured her . Ellen and he were alarmed at Katherine 's prolonged absence , and had come to seek her . Finding that the old woman had not made her appearance , they began to view the entire affair with some suspicion ; and Kate was compelled to return with them to the farm — a prey to the most cruel disappointment . "
776862	776867	776868	776868	she	26813	" said the farmer , "
776917	777280	776904	776904	he	1300	" During the remainder of the evening Kate was pensive and melancholy ; nor could all Ellen 's affectionate endeavours wean her from her sorrowful thoughtfulness . They retired to rest early ; and Katherine rose next morning with the hope of receiving tidings from the old woman . But hour after hour passed without gratifying her wish . Ellen purposely delayed their departure for London , to afford a fair opportunity for the arrival of any intelligence which the old woman might forward ; but three o'clock came , and still all was blank disappointment and mystery in respect to the affair . Then Kate herself saw the inutility of tarrying longer ; and , having taken an affectionate farewell of Mrs. Bennet , the young ladies were accompanied by the farmer to Hounslow . There they obtained a conveyance for the capital , and Mr. Bennet saw them depart in safety . We must now succinctly record a few incidents which occurred at the mansion of Prince Alberto in the vicinity of Richmond , from the period when Richard bade adieu to Isabella ere his departure for Castelcicala in the month of October , 1840 , until the end of January , 1841 — that is , up to the date at which we have brought our narrative in the preceding chapter . The Princess Isabella declared , at her farewell meeting with Richard , that wild hopes and exalted visions filled her imagination when she contemplated the enterprise on which her lover was about to embark . So well did she read the true character of our hero , and so elevated was her opinion of his high qualifications , that she felt persuaded he only required an opportunity to open for himself a grand and brilliant career . Her boundless affection for Richard Markham aided her not only in fostering these convictions , but also in shadowing forth and defining the elements of a glorious success and rapid rise on the part of one to whom her first and undivided love was given . But when she tore herself away from his last embrace,—when she breathed the mournful word "
777283	777657	776904	776904	he	1300	" and then separated from the generous , the high - minded , and handsome young man who possessed her heart,—oh ! how acute was the anguish that filled her soul ! For some minutes — when he was no longer in sight — all her golden dreams and glorious visions fled from her imagination;—she strove to recall them , as a drowning person in the dark hour of night struggles to gain the surface of the waters once more to catch another glimpse of the bright stars above;—but hope seemed to have yielded to blank despair . The Princess , however , possessed a firm mind ; and when the primal burst of anguish was over , she wrestled with her gloomy imaginings , until she gradually triumphed over their mournful influence . Having purposely prolonged her walk homewards , in order to compose herself , Isabella did not re - enter the mansion until she had collected her scattered thoughts and had wiped away the traces of her tears . Her father had all along discountenanced the expedition to Castelcicala , so far as he was concerned ; although he could not do otherwise than wish it success . Indeed , as he himself had intimated to General Grachia , he would no doubt have joined in it , had he been differently situated . It was therefore with feelings of admiration that the Prince had from the first heard of Markham 's enthusiasm in the Constitutional cause : and at that period he frequently found himself dwelling attentively upon all the good points in Richard 's character which had once made our hero so welcome a guest at the mansion . As for Isabella 's mother , this Princess was more than ever favourable towards Markham ; for she saw in his present conduct nothing save a profound devotion to the cause of her illustrious husband , and a laudable ambition to render himself worthy of her daughter 's love — that love which was no secret to the parents of the amiable girl ! When Isabella returned to the drawing - room after her interview with Richard , her still melancholy demeanour attracted the notice of her affectionate parents . "
777665	777674	777660	777660	you	21124	" inquired the Prince , eyeing her attentively . "
777679	777685	777660	777660	you	21124	" was the instantaneous reply , "
777703	777704	777700	777701	Mr. Markham	874	" "
777707	777716	777700	777701	Mr. Markham	874	" exclaimed the Prince , a little impatiently . "
777729	777743	777726	777726	his	874	" continued Isabella , in a tone expressive of the pride of truth ; "
777787	777788	777776	777776	his	874	" "
777794	777823	777790	777790	you	0	" said the Prince , in a softening voice , and with a manner which denoted how justly proud he was of the upright mind of his daughter . "
777831	777840	777824	777824	We	21129	" answered Isabel , wiping away a tear ; "
777849	777857	777824	777824	We	21129	" she added in a faltering tone , "
777882	777883	777886	777886	we	21129	" "
777894	777903	777886	777886	we	21129	" said the Princess of Castelcicala , hastily . "
777930	777931	777925	777925	he	874	" "
777942	777953	777932	777932	I	0	" murmured Isabella , casting down her eyes and blushing : "
778002	778299	777988	777988	I	0	" The Prince made no reply : but the expression of his countenance was not severe ; and the Princess of Castelcicala embraced her daughter affectionately . From that time the mansion contained three anxious hearts ; for the exiled family was deeply interested in the results of the expedition to Castelcicala . Who , then , can depict the disappointment with which the tidings of the fatal affair of Ossore were received , at the end of November , in that dwelling ? The Prince and Princess perceived in the failure of the enterprise a deep blow to their own cause in the Duchy , inasmuch as it was calculated to afford the supporters of the Grand Duke an excuse for heaping opprobrium on the name of Alberto , whom they would point out as the instigator of the invasion;—and Isabella was overwhelmed with grief by the mystery which at that period enveloped the fate of Richard . Several days of heart - breaking suspense elapsed : the colour forsook the maiden 's cheek ; and her countenance became expressive of a deep melancholy . Nor was this terrible uncertainty concerning Richard 's fate the only cause of affliction which she was now doomed to experience . Her father was so profoundly affected by the failure of the expedition , and the evils which he believed would result to his own interests in many respects , that he became ill , and was soon unable to leave his bed . Then how assiduous was the poor girl to her parent , while her own heart was often well - nigh breaking ! The Prince grew irritable and impatient , and even reproached his daughter for fretting on account of one who , as he declared , "
778319	778414	778415	778415	He	21134	" But Isabella bore all this without a murmur ; and as her father grew more harsh , her attentions towards him were redoubled . In her mother 's kindness and sympathy the afflicted maiden found a consolation ; but she could with difficulty bear up against the agony of suspense and alarm which she experienced on account of her lover . At length,—about a week after the receipt of the fatal tidings connected with the battle of Ossore,—Whittingham called at the mansion , and placed in Isabella 's hand a letter from Richard . "
778421	778432	778415	778415	He	21134	" were the maiden 's first words of reviving hope ; "
778440	778478	778415	778415	He	21134	" But Isabella 's joy was speedily overclouded once more ; for she saw , by the guarded manner in which he wrote and by the omission of his signature , that her lover was in danger . Nevertheless—"where
778487	778719	778415	778415	He	21134	" as the proverb says ; and , somewhat consoled by his conviction , she was less miserable than before ! And now came another tedious interval of suspense , the wretchedness of which was enhanced by the increasing indisposition of the Prince . At length — at the expiration of about three weeks — the Princess Isabella received a letter from Signora Viviani , the nature of which , as already known to our readers , was not extremely well calculated to reassure the affectionate girl relative to her lover . It was true that she was informed of Richard 's safe arrival at Pinalla , where he was in the society of kind friends ; but vague and torturing fears were aroused by the fact that he himself had been unable to write to her . Again was there a weary interval of silence ; but this was suddenly broken in a manner calculated to re - awaken all the bright hopes which Isabella had once entertained relative to the future greatness of Richard Markham . On the 16th of January , the news of the glorious exploit at Estella reached the mansion of the exiled family in England ; and inspired the young Princess with the most enthusiastic feelings of admiration towards him whom she loved so fondly , and of whom she had always thought so well . "
778732	778750	778724	778724	I	0	" exclaimed the Prince , when Signor Viviani 's letter narrating that event was read to him . "
778804	778805	778840	778840	Castelcicala	1085	" "
778812	778829	778807	778807	yourself	0	" said Isabella , enraptured at the manner in which he had spoken of her lover : "
778847	779009	778840	778840	Castelcicala	1085	" But the Prince could not tranquillize his mind : the thraldom of a sick bed had become more intolerable to him than ever ; and , although he now ceased to reproach his daughter , his irritability of temper painfully increased . Three days afterwards letters were received at the mansion announcing Richard 's entry into Villabella . Then the colour came back again to the cheeks of the charming Italian maiden ; and her eyes shone with all their wonted brilliancy . Forgotten were her recent sorrows — gone was her agonising suspense — banished was the memory of her cruel doubts;—her lover was already a hero — and hope was once more enthroned in her heart . The Prince now began to perceive the absolute necessity of avoiding the excitement of useless repinings at that illness which still chained him to his bed . Richard 's letters told him how the inhabitants of Villabella had shouted the thrilling words "
779012	779109	778840	778840	Castelcicala	1085	Alberto!"—and the Prince was inspired with hopes the extent of which he did not seek to conceal . Four days elapsed ; and when the postman was again descried by the watchful Isabella advancing through the shrubbery towards the mansion , how quickly beat the hearts of the illustrious exiles ! Yes — there were letters from Castelcicala:—never were sealed documents more quickly torn open ! And , oh ! what joyous news did they contain — the victory of Piacere ! Isabella 's feelings found vent in tears:—she was so happy — that she wept ! "
779116	779139	778840	778840	Castelcicala	1085	" said the Prince , raising himself upon his pillow ; then , after a moment 's pause , he exclaimed warmly , "
779146	779215	779143	779144	a hero	45135	" Ah ! how touchingly grateful was the glance which Isabella cast upon her father through her tears , to thank him for that generous sentiment relative to one in whom she felt so deep an interest ! Another short interval now occurred ; and then fresh letters came , bringing farther tidings of success . The battle of Abrantani was a worthy sequence to that of Piacere ! "
779222	779234	779236	779236	you	1329	" now exclaimed the Prince , pressing her to his heart , "
779255	779256	779236	779236	you	1329	" "
779266	779271	779236	779236	you	1329	" answered the maiden : "
779296	779297	779236	779236	you	1329	" "
779309	779319	779236	779236	you	1329	" observed the Princess of Castelcicala to her husband , "
779330	779331	779332	779332	He	874	" "
779353	779638	779332	779332	He	874	" ejaculated the Prince , enthusiastically . Isabella pressed her mother 's hand tenderly for having obtained this most welcome avowal . The health of Prince Alberto now rapidly improved ; and in a few days he was enabled to leave the couch to which he had been confined for many weary weeks . And Isabella — Oh ! all the charming carnation tinge had come back to her cheeks ; and her eyes were brilliant with the purest rays of happiness and hope . Her fondest dreams — her brightest visions were all but realised : her lover was accomplishing those grand destinies of which her mental vision had caught glimpses ere his departure from England ; and the world was already busy with his name . And now , too , was that name ever upon the tongue of her father , who pronounced it with admiration and respect . A few days after the arrival of the intelligence of the decisive victory of Abrantani , the newspapers acquainted the illustrious Italian family with the fact that the Committee of Government at Montoni had bestowed the title of Marquis of Estella upon the youthful Commander - in - Chief of the Armies of Castelcicala . Oh ! with what joyous feelings — with what ineffable emotions of enthusiasm , did the charming Isabella read aloud to her parents that account of her lover 's elevation,—an elevation which , as he himself had felt convinced , must remove one grand obstacle that had hitherto existed in the way of their happiness . And how did her young heart beat and her bosom heave , when her father exclaimed , in an emphatic tone , "
779704	780260	779681	779681	I	0	" Isabella threw herself at her father 's feet , and pressed to her lips the hand which she also moistened with her tears . She endeavoured to murmur words of gratitude for that most welcome assurance ; but her heart was too full — she could only weep ! It was a most touching scene ; and , perhaps , never had that exiled family experienced more perfect happiness than on this occasion . But the sentiment was soon destined to give way to new fears and fresh anxieties . It was well - known that Montoni was besieged by an immense Austrian force ; and the English newspapers , in commenting upon the position of the Constitutionalists , declared that though the moral effects of so decisive a victory as that of Abrantani must be very great , there was nevertheless much room to doubt whether the Marquis of Estella would be able to assemble an army sufficiently strong to march to the relief of the capital . Prince Alberto trembled as he read these observations ; because he not only comprehended their justice , but was also well aware that the fate of Castelcicala could be alone decided by a pitched battle between the Austrians and the Constitutionalists . He endeavoured to conceal his misgivings from his wife and daughter : but they saw what was passing in his mind;—and thus all was still anxiety and hope — uncertainty and fervent aspiration , at the mansion of the Prince . Thus did a few days pass ; and Alberto suffered a slight relapse , in consequence of the nervous state of doubt in which he was plunged . All his hopes — all his interests — all his prospects were at stake . If the Constitutionalists were successful , a crown awaited him : if the Austrians triumphed , the Grand Duke Angelo had pledged himself to adopt a scion of the imperial family of Vienna as the heir to the throne . Thus Prince Alberto hovered between a glorious elevation or a fatal fall . The Princess , his wife , entertained sanguine hopes that a campaign so successfully begun , would terminate in triumph ; and Isabella called every argument to her aid to convince her father and mother that all must end well ! Nevertheless , poor girl ! she also had her intervals of doubt and alarm ; and many were the tears which she shed in secret as she prayed for the safety of her lover . And now how eagerly was the arrival of the postman looked for every day ; how anxiously was the presence of the newspaper awaited ! At length , on the morning of the 29th of January , all doubts were cleared up — all uncertainties terminated . The illustrious family was seated at the breakfast table — a mere ceremonious mockery , for they were unable to eat a morsel . Presently a servant entered , and presented the morning paper to the Prince . Alberto opened it with a trembling hand : his wife and daughter watched him attentively . Suddenly he started — his eyes were lighted up with their wonted fires — a flush appeared on his pale cheek — and he exclaimed in a fervent tone , "
780268	780331	779681	779681	I	0	" He could say no more : his emotions nearly overpowered him , weakened as he was by a long illness . Isabella caught the paper as it was falling from his hands . One glance was sufficient : it told her all ! For there — conspicuously displayed at the head of a column — was the following glorious announcement : — "
780334	780345	779681	779681	I	0	" TOTAL DEFEAT OF THE AUSTRIANS — DELIVERANCE OF MONTONI . "
780359	780428	779681	779681	I	0	" ' The Castelcicalan steamer Torione has just arrived . The Austrians were completely routed on the 23rd . Montoni is delivered . The Grand Duke has fled . The Marquis of Estella entered the capital at three o'clock on the 24th . He has been appointed Regent until the arrival of Alberto I. The Torione left while the cannon were saluting the presence of the Marquis . ' "
780429	780445	780447	780447	Isabella	1329	" Let me be the first to congratulate your Serene Highness on this glorious result ! "
780465	780476	780478	780478	Alberto	1444	" No — not on your knees , dearest Isabel ! "
780486	780506	780507	780507	he	1444	" but come to my arms , sweet girl — and you also , beloved companion of my banishment , "
780524	780545	780507	780507	he	1444	joy:—"come to my arms — for we are no longer exiles — we shall once more behold our native land ! "
780984	780987	780988	780988	He	1645	" cabinet . "
781702	781705	781701	781701	his	1645	" cabinet , "
782083	782094	782095	782097	This young lady	39501	" to be that morning led to the hymeneal altar . "
782359	782367	782369	782370	the valet	5525	" Your lordship is better this morning , "
782374	782385	782387	782388	the nobleman	3005	" Yes — I am a little better , Quentin , "
782390	782431	782387	782388	the nobleman	3005	" and yet I hardly know that I have ever felt actually ill . Want of appetite is the principal ailment which affects me . It makes me grow thin , you perceive:—but am I so very thin , Quentin ? "
782432	782440	782442	782443	the valet	5525	" Oh ! no , my lord , "
782464	782480	782442	782443	the valet	5525	" Your lordship is certainly not so stout as your lordship was ; but — — "
782481	782487	782387	782388	the nobleman	3005	" But what , Quentin ? "
782488	782522	782442	782443	the valet	5525	" I think — if your lordship would not be offended — that I am acquainted with the cause of that want of appetite , which prevents your lordship from taking proper sustenance . "
782523	782543	782545	782546	the nobleman	3005	" Go on , Quentin : I shall not be offended . I know you are a faithful fellow , "
782548	782557	782545	782546	the nobleman	3005	" What do you think is the cause ? "
782558	782573	782575	782576	the valet	5525	" With your lordship 's permission , I should say that smoking too much — "
782580	782585	782587	782588	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" Pooh ! pooh!—nonsense ! "
782592	782698	782587	782588	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" I have always been a great smoker : you know I have . I began to smoke when I was only fourteen ; and as I was so long a bachelor — during the best years of my life , indeed — I had no reason to curb myself in my favourite recreation . It would be different , perhaps , if I used the filthy tobacco which you buy in England — or if I smoked strong Havannah cigars . But that mild and aromatic plant , which is reared in the East , can not injure a soul:—a child might smoke it . "
782699	782705	782707	782708	the valet	5525	" Your lordship knows best , "
782719	782732	782707	782708	the valet	5525	" But I think your lordship has smoked more lately than — — "
782733	782740	782743	782744	the nobleman	3005	" I dare say I have , "
782751	782842	782743	782744	the nobleman	3005	" But the last chest of tobacco which my brother sent me is so much better than all the former ones ; and there is such a delightful soothing influence in the samples of Turkish and Persian , that I can not lay aside my pipe when once I take it up . Let me see ! It was only last October — yes , and at the end of October , too — that I received the chest ; and I have already made a deep inroad into it . "
782843	782856	782858	782859	the valet	5525	" Is the Honourable Mr. Vernon still in Turkey , my lord ? "
782861	783045	782858	782859	the valet	5525	" Yes : at least , when I heard from him last — that was when he sent me the chest of tobacco in October — he stated in his letter that he should yet remain abroad for two or three years . He seems devoted to the East . But you know , Quentin , that he and I are not upon the very best of terms , although we occasionally correspond and interchange little civilities every now and then . However , I can scarcely blame myself for any coldness that may subsist between us . I have behaved to him as an elder brother ought to a younger one;—and because I would not consent to minister to his extravagant propensities he took umbrage . When I espoused her ladyship last May , I wrote to Mr. Vernon , who was then at Beyrout , acquainting him with that event ; and his reply , which accompanied the chest of tobacco in October , was more kind and conciliatory than I could have expected , considering his gloomy and morose character . "
783046	783060	783062	783062	Quentin	1704	" I am glad that he exhibited a proper feeling towards your lordship , "
783077	783083	783085	783086	the nobleman	3005	" And so am I , "
783088	783129	783085	783086	the nobleman	3005	" Then I wrote to him again in November , to inform him that Lady Ravensworth was in a way that gave promise of a continuation of our name,—the name of Ravensworth is a very ancient one , Quentin — — "
783130	783153	783062	783062	Quentin	1704	" Yes , my lord . I believe your lordship can trace it back to the invasion of Britain by the Romans ? "
783154	783161	783163	783164	the nobleman	3005	" No — not quite that , "
783166	783210	783163	783164	the nobleman	3005	" but to the conquest by William the Norman . However , I wrote to my brother , as I have informed you ; and I received no answer . I therefore conclude that he has renewed his travels through Asia - Minor . "
783235	783241	783163	783164	the nobleman	3005	" just one little pipe , "
783304	783339	783299	783299	he	1645	" The company are already assembled , my lord , in the drawing - room ; and her ladyship will be quite delighted to see your lordship looking so very well to - day . "
783461	783465	783466	783466	she	1680	" interesting situation , "
783696	783706	783708	783710	the innocent reader	21276	" Why did she not remonstrate with her guardian ? "
783773	783789	783791	783796	that self - same innocent reader	21283	" But , then , poor Maria might have opened her heart to Lady Rossville ? "
783838	783849	783791	783796	that self - same innocent reader	21283	" catching at the first rich man who offered himself , "
784312	784315	784334	784334	her	21316	" got off "
784705	784728	784702	784702	she	1545	" It is very strange that the lady's - maid whom you have hired did not come last evening , as promised . "
784729	784738	784740	784740	Maria	1137	" It is , indeed , very annoying , "
784765	784770	784772	784773	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" But never mind , "
784779	784818	784772	784773	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" you shall take my maid Flora with you , and I will either find another at my leisure , or keep the one whom you have engaged , should she make her appearance after you have left . "
784819	784829	784831	784831	Maria	1137	" This is very kind of you , Adeline , "
784835	784855	784857	784858	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" I am afraid you did not manage well in your first essay in choosing dependants , dear Maria , "
784860	784916	784857	784858	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" You were attracted by the advertisement in the Morning Herald ; whereas I never should think of taking a lady's - maid who advertises . Then , as you yourself told me , you went to some out - of - the - way place in the City for the young woman 's character . "
784917	784927	784929	784929	Maria	1137	" Oh ! I was perfectly satisfied , Adeline , "
784978	784984	784960	784974	Lord Rossville , who had been standing at the window for the last few moments	21332	" Here 's the bridegroom ! "
785055	785058	785067	785067	He	21324	" happy man "
785311	785328	785338	785338	he	21346	" A most un - christianlike and decidedly unhallowed manner for a bridegroom to comport himself , "
785346	785352	785354	785355	Lord Rossville	1703	" It certainly is strange , "
785357	785371	785354	785355	Lord Rossville	1703	" But perhaps our young friend is anxious to display his skill — — "
785372	785385	785387	785388	Count Swindeliski	1710	" No such a ting , milor — no such a ting ! "
785394	785418	785387	785388	Count Swindeliski	1710	" Dat young gentelman 's von great homebogue ; and if me was dere , me hit him some kick for his pain . "
785419	785434	785445	785445	she	1712	" Ah ! he does n't ride so well as my poor dear fourth , "
785454	785464	785466	785468	the young clergyman	21349	" It 's all vanity and vexation of spirit , "
785476	785487	785489	785490	the Bishop	17258	" No , sir — it is not , sir , "
785493	785506	785489	785490	the Bishop	17258	" it is sheer bad riding , sir — and nothing else . "
785523	785528	785530	785533	a Member of Parliament	6339	" For my part , "
785535	785548	785530	785533	a Member of Parliament	6339	" I move that we repair to the young gentleman 's assistance . "
785549	785558	785560	785561	another Member	21354	" And I beg to second the motion , "
785563	785573	785560	785561	another Member	21354	" Ah ! by heaven , that 's serious ! "
785664	785671	785673	785674	Baron Torkemdef	1711	" It 's noting at all , "
785676	785705	785673	785674	Baron Torkemdef	1711	" he only tink himself hurted — you only tink dat a horse what did seem to run way wid him:—it all de idea — all de fancy . "
785888	785902	785873	785874	Lady Adeline	1545	" We have been painfully excited on your account , Sir Cherry Bounce . "
786149	786163	786165	786166	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" We have been painfully excited on your account , Sir Cherry Bounce , "

786224	786239	786241	786243	Major Smilax Dapper	1492	" I never saw such a Guy on a horse before — strike me ! "
786254	786284	786241	786243	Major Smilax Dapper	1492	" He would keep in advance of me the whole way ; and although I called after him to rein in — strike him!—he would not listen to me . "
786285	786297	786299	786300	Sir Cherry	1051	" It wath that thouting and hoowaying that fwightened my horth , "
786309	786324	786326	786327	Lord Rossville	1703	" At all events you are not hurt — and that is the essential , "
786329	786343	786345	786346	Baron Torkemdef	1711	" Hurted ! no — of course de good gentleman 's not hurted , "
786348	786382	786345	786346	Baron Torkemdef	1711	" it noting at all but de idea — de fancy . You know vare well , sare , dat you not really exist — dat you only tink you do exist — — "
786481	786494	786496	786497	Mrs. Berrymenny	1712	" I was just as timid with my first as Maria is , "
786504	786518	786496	786497	Mrs. Berrymenny	1712	" with my second I was a leetle more gay;—with my third — — "
786519	786524	786526	786527	the Countess	5273	" Dear Mrs. Berrymenny , "
786531	786558	786526	786527	the Countess	5273	" pray do not talk of your seconds and thirds , when here are my two youngest daughters who have n't even yet got their firsts . "

786970	787014	786959	786960	Mrs. Berrymenny	1712	" that it is all mere fancy on my part that I have had five husbands ? If so , sir , all I can say is that I should like to have a sixth opportunity of putting your theory to the test . "
787126	787129	787131	787132	Major Dapper	1492	" Cherry , "
787134	787160	787131	787132	Major Dapper	1492	" you are not half lively enough — blow you ! You look like a fool — but I suppose you ca n't help it . "

787258	787265	787267	787270	the Countess of Brazenphace	21407	" Lord Ravensworth is certainly improving , "
787276	787288	787267	787270	the Countess of Brazenphace	21407	" My second used to deceive me in the same manner , "
787300	787326	787267	787270	the Countess of Brazenphace	21407	" He was always dying — and always getting better , for at least three years before he went off altogether . My fourth — — "
787327	787339	787342	787343	the Countess	5273	" Oh ! you have told me all about him before , "
787363	787378	787380	787381	Baron Torkemdef	1711	" Dat vare excellent bird — how you call him ? Peasant — ah ! "
787401	787444	787383	787385	the young clergyman	21349	" But after all it no use for to praise one ting or to blame anoder—'cause dem each de idea — de fancy . Dere really no table — no peasant — no wine — no peoples : it all de imagination . "
787487	787500	787485	787485	himself	21349	" I wonder whether the Baron 's appetite is an idea also . "
787501	787504	787506	787509	the Countess of Brazenphace	21407	" Seraphina , "
787516	787568	787506	787509	the Countess of Brazenphace	21407	" if you look so much at Count Swindeliski , I shall be very angry . He has got no money , and is not a match for you . There is the Member for Buyemup - cum - Rhino sitting on your right , and he is a wealthy bachelor . "
787569	787575	787577	787578	Miss Seraphina	1720	" But , dear mamma , "
787585	787592	787577	787578	Miss Seraphina	1720	" he is at least sixty . "
787593	787599	787506	787509	the Countess of Brazenphace	21407	" So much the better , "
787605	787623	787506	787509	the Countess of Brazenphace	21407	" he is the easier to catch . Now mind your p 's and q 's , Miss. "
787670	787676	787680	787681	Miss Wigmore	1046	" Miss Blewstocken , dear , "
787683	787702	787680	787681	Miss Wigmore	1046	" have you composed nothing appropriate for the present occasion?—no sweet little poem in your own fascinating style ? "
787703	787713	787715	787718	the literary young lady	21420	" Oh ! dear Miss Wigmore , how unkind ! "
787727	787791	787715	787718	the literary young lady	21420	" I could not have believed it of you — to appeal to me before so many ! If I have told you in confidence , or if it be indeed generally known that ' The Poetic Nosegay ' was written by me — and if it had a very large circulation — I do not think it is fair to expect — — "
787792	787798	787800	787801	Miss Wigmore	1046	" Ah ! Miss Blewstocken , "
787803	787815	787800	787801	Miss Wigmore	1046	" we are all aware that your pen is seldom idle . "
787816	787829	787831	787833	the literary lady	21421	" It is really quite provoking to find oneself known to Fame , "
787849	787891	787831	787833	the literary lady	21421	" I wish I had never written at all:—not that I have ever been induced to acknowledge the authorship of that novel which was so successful last year—'The Royal Fiddlestick , ' I mean . No:—but the time may come — — "
787922	787928	787930	787934	the Bishop of Lord Rossville	21423	" Who is that lady ? "
787936	787944	787930	787934	the Bishop of Lord Rossville	21423	" Miss Blewstocken , the celebrated authoress , "
787949	787952	787954	787955	the Bishop	17258	" Oh ! "
787987	787996	787998	788000	the German Baron	1711	" Talk of de poetry and de novel , "
788002	788032	787998	788000	the German Baron	1711	" what are all dem to de researches of de philosoph ? Was your lordship ever read my von grand vork on de ' Ideality of de Universe ? ' "
788033	788047	788049	788050	the Bishop	17258	" I can not say that I have ever read it , sir , "
788056	788117	788049	788050	the Bishop	17258	" I have heard of it , sir — and I consider its doctrines to be opposed to the Bible , sir . I believe it is in fourteen large volumes , sir ? Well , sir — then all I have to observe upon it is that so many quartos are themselves too substantial to be a mere idea . "
788118	788125	788127	788128	the Baron	9919	" But dey are von idea ! "
788132	788183	788127	788128	the Baron	9919	" Dey do not really exist , milor — in spite of what your lordship shall say . Every ting is de idea — we be ourselves all de walking , moving idea : dere no such ting as joy — no such ting as pain — dey mere sensation — "
788279	788288	788290	788291	the Bishop	17258	" Pray do not mind it , sir , "
788295	788302	788290	788291	the Bishop	17258	" it is merely an idea . "
788303	788313	788319	788319	he	1711	" Yes — it de idea , no doubt ! "
788339	788364	788330	788331	the domestic	2464	" but de idea was come in de unpleasant shape — dat noting against my doctrine — tousand devils , how him do burn ! "

788448	788456	788458	788460	the fascinating foreigner	21436	" It vare fine — vare fine , "
788462	788536	788458	788460	the fascinating foreigner	21436	" De ancestral castle of the Swindeliskis vare grand — touch de clouds — so long dat when you do stand at de von end you shall not see de oder — so wide dat horses shall always be kept saddled for to cross de court . My father was keep tree tousand dependants : me not choose for to spend de revenue in dat vay — me only may keep von tousand . "
788537	788549	788551	788553	Miss Helena Wigmore	1046	" And can you prefer England to your own beautiful country ? "
788555	788562	788564	788565	the Count	26666	" Me shall not prefare England , "
788567	788605	788564	788565	the Count	26666	" me shall choose wife of de English ladies — dey vare beautiful — vare fine — vare clevare . Den me take my wife to Poland , where she shall be von vare great lady indeed . "

788798	788802	788792	788793	Major Dapper	1492	" blow you ! "

788897	788906	788908	788909	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" I have directed Flora to accompany you , "
788911	788960	788908	788909	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" and you can keep her altogether , if you choose . Should the young woman whom you have hired , make her appearance , I will retain her , and give her a trial . But what is her name ? I had forgotten to ask you . "
789037	789051	789057	789057	she	1712	" I wish I was bound on a similar trip with a sixth , "
789068	789089	789057	789057	she	1712	" I wish I could get off my eighth and ninth as easily as the Rossvilles have done with Maria , "
789096	789114	789091	789094	the Countess of Brazenphace	1717	" But I am afraid that the member for Buyemup - cum - Rhino will not bite . "

Dat handsome chariot do not actually exist — it only de idea ; and dat loving pair what shall sit in it are only idea as well . All is idea — me an idea — and dat Lord Bischop wid de lawn - sleeves only an idea . "
789256	789262	789264	789264	Adeline	1545	" Where is Lord Ravensworth ? "
789269	789290	789266	789267	a domestic	28911	" His lordship felt suddenly unwell a few moments ago , my lady , and has retired to his cabinet . "
789291	789303	789305	789306	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" Ah ! a reaction — a recurrence to the meerschaum ! "
789315	789320	789322	789323	the servant	2459	" Please your ladyship , "
789325	789369	789322	789323	the servant	2459	" a young woman has just arrived from London . She says that she was hired by Miss Villiers — I beg pardon Lady Bounce — and that an accident to the vehicle in which she came to the Hall has delayed her . "
789370	789380	789382	789382	Adeline	1545	" Oh ! she is to remain with me , "
789384	789414	789382	789382	Adeline	1545	" Tell her that I will take her into my service on the same terms that were arranged between her and Lady Bounce . She is to replace Flora . "
789415	789420	789421	789422	the servant	2459	" Very good , my lady;"—and
789428	789434	789436	789436	Adeline	1545	" One moment , William , "
789442	789461	789436	789436	Adeline	1545	" Did this young woman mention her name — for as yet I am really ignorant of it ? "
789462	789468	789470	789471	the domestic	2464	" Yes , my lady , "
789473	789480	789470	789471	the domestic	2464	" her name is Lydia Hutchinson . "
789486	789490	789492	789493	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" Lydia Hutchinson ! "
789505	789512	789514	789515	Lady Rossville	1563	" Are you unwell , Adeline ? "
789521	789532	789534	789534	Adeline	1545	" No — a sudden indisposition — it is nothing ! "
790355	790421	790348	790348	Viola	1319	thus:—"The young woman who now stands before you has been unfortunate — very unfortunate ; and hers has been the fate of the unfortunate . She is most anxious to eat the bread of industry and honesty . I am persuaded that a kind hand stretched out to aid her in this desire , will raise her to happiness , and ensure her lasting gratitude . "
790649	790657	790659	790659	Adeline	1545	" But of what avail are tears ? "
790663	790701	790659	790659	Adeline	1545	" The danger is here — the evil is before me . We must meet:—it were better that I should see her at once ! Doubtless she is unaware in whose abode she is now a menial ! "
790735	790743	790745	790746	the housekeeper	39575	" This is my lady 's apartment , "
790751	790755	790745	790746	the housekeeper	39575	" Thank you , "
790805	790809	790811	790811	Adeline	1545	" Come in , "
790943	790952	790940	790940	she	1545	" Miss Enfield ! Is it indeed you ? "
790953	790959	790940	790940	she	1545	" I am Lady Ravensworth , "
790966	790975	790977	790977	Lydia	1544	" Oh ! now I understand it all ! "
790996	791042	790989	790989	she	1544	" you have taken compassion on me at length,—you discovered where I was residing,—you sent some friend to engage me as if for herself,—and you were determined to surprise me by this proof of your goodness — this token of your kind remembrance of me ! "
791043	791046	791048	791048	Adeline	1545	" No , "
791050	791113	791048	791048	Adeline	1545	" accident alone has brought you into my service : and you must well understand that I am not over well pleased with the coincidence . In a word , name the sum that will satisfy you for the loss of a good place — and take your departure . You can leave to me the invention of some proper excuse — — "
791114	791119	791121	791121	Lydia	1544	" Is it possible ? "
791123	791133	791121	791121	Lydia	1544	" this cold — heartless — ungrateful reception — — "
791134	791144	791146	791146	Adeline	1545	" Do you recollect to whom you are speaking ? "
791155	791167	791169	791169	Lydia	1544	" Oh ! yes,—I know that full well — too well , "
791195	791268	791169	791169	Lydia	1544	" I stand in the presence of one to save whose good fame I sacrificed my own — to shield whom from the finger of scorn and reproach , I allowed myself to be made a victim ! Yes , proud lady of Ravensworth — so many years have not elapsed since , in my cold and cheerless garret , in the depth of a winter night , you gave birth — — "
791269	791274	791276	791276	Adeline	1545	" Silence , Lydia ! "
791295	791308	791169	791169	Lydia	1544	" Let us not refer to the past . The present — — "
791309	791312	791314	791314	Lydia	1544	" No , "
791321	791443	791314	791314	Lydia	1544	" you can not — you shall not deter me from talking of the past . For you , lady , are so highly exalted above myself , that it is almost impossible for you to shape the least — the faintest — the most remote idea of the depth of misery into which I have been plunged . And yet I pant — I long — I feel a burning desire to make you comprehend all I have suffered;—because to my acquaintance with you — to my fatal connexion with you at the seminary — may be traced all the sorrows — the profound , ineffable woes — the degradations — the terrible afflictions that have since marked my career ! "
791444	791462	791464	791465	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" I will not hear more;—I can not permit you thus to insult — to upbraid me , "
791476	791506	791508	791508	Lydia	1544	" Oh ! I have longed for this opportunity to meet you face to face , and tell you all I have suffered , and all I now feel ! "
791510	791645	791508	791508	Lydia	1544	" and it is not likely that I will abandon so favourable an occasion . No — you have triumphed over me long enough : you have used me as a tool when it suited your convenience — and you spurned me when I had ceased to be useful . Though maintaining your own outward respectability , honour , and good name upon the wreck of mine , you dare to treat me with the blackest ingratitude ! Lady Ravensworth , I said that all I have endured was traceable to you ! When I first met you at the Kensington seminary , I was pure , artless , innocent:—you were already initiated in the secrets of intrigue — you were even then , at that tender age , a wanton in your heart . "
791646	791657	791659	791659	Adeline	1545	" Lydia — Miss Hutchinson ! Oh ! my God ! "
791668	791690	791692	791694	the unfortunate woman	42601	" Yes — you were already trembling on the verge of dishonour — you were courting seduction and all its consequences ! "
791726	791821	791692	791694	the unfortunate woman	42601	" I even remember still — oh ! how well I remember — that you were the first who opened my eyes to the existence of female frailty . Yes — I , who went to that school as a teacher , was taught by a pupil ! And merciful heavens ! what did you teach me ? You led me on step by step in the path of duplicity and dishonour : you made me the companion of your own amours ; and we became victims to our seducers on the same day ! "
791822	791831	791833	791833	Adeline	1545	" Oh ! spare me — spare me ! "
791835	791853	791833	791833	Adeline	1545	" My God ! if we were overheard ! I should be lost — ruined — undone ! "
791854	791882	791884	791885	Lydia Hutchinson	1544	" Rest tranquil on that head:—it does not suit my present purposes to betray you — and I will explain my reason shortly . In the meantime , "
791887	791907	791884	791885	Lydia Hutchinson	1544	" I must recall to your recollection all those circumstances which led me to sacrifice myself to save you . "
791908	791923	791925	791926	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" No — no : I remember everything . Say no more , Lydia , "
791928	791950	791925	791926	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" Tell me what you require — what I can do for you ! Will you have money ? or — — "
791951	791954	791956	791956	Lydia	1544	" Peace!—silence ! "
791969	791972	791973	791973	she	1544	" Oh ! "
791979	792225	791973	791973	she	1544	" I have sold myself for gold;—but never — never may that occur again ; either bodily or morally ! Your ladyship declares you remember all that has ever passed between us ? Then does your ingratitude become infinitely the more vile and contemptible . For when you lay writhing in the agonies of maternity , I was there,—there in that cold and cheerless garret,—to minister unto you ! And when the lifeless form of your babe was discovered concealed amongst my clothes — in my room — and in my box,—I did not turn to the school - mistress and say , ' It is not mine : it is Miss Adeline Enfield's!'—When , too , I saw that you were so weak , so feeble , and so suffering that the cold night air would kill you , I took your child , and , like a thief , I stole away from the house to sink the corpse in a distant pool . For you had said to me , ' Keep my secret , dearest Lydia : the honour of a noble family depends upon your prudence!'—My prudence ! Oh ! no:—the honour of your family depended on the sacrifice of mine ! And I did sacrifice my family to save you;—for to all that I did for you may be traced the broken heart of my poor father and the assassination of my brother by the hand of the duellist ! "
792226	792235	792238	792239	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" Oh ! spare me — spare me ! "
792241	792268	792238	792239	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" I have been very ungrateful — very unkind ; but now , Lydia , I will endeavour to compensate you for all that has passed . "
792269	792280	792282	792283	Miss Hutchinson	1551	" One being alone can so compensate me , lady , "
792289	792485	792282	792283	Miss Hutchinson	1551	" and that being is God ! No human power can give me back my poor father or my much - loved brother : no human agency can obliterate from my mind those infamies and degradations to which I have been subject . What amount of gold can reward me for days of starvation and nights of painful wanderings amidst the creatures of crime , without a place to repose my aching , shivering limbs ? And sometimes , amidst the overwhelming crowd of sorrows that so often drove me to the river 's bank , or made me pause on the threshold of the chemist's - shop where poison was to be procured,—I saw , from time to time , your name mentioned in the newspapers . Oh ! what memories did those occasions recall ! On the very day that you were presented at Court , I had not a crust to eat ! And twice on that day did I seek the river 's brink , whence I turned away again — afraid of changing even the horrible certainties of this life 's sufferings for the more appalling uncertainties of another world . "
792486	792496	792498	792499	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" Lydia — Lydia , you are killing me ! "
792501	792538	792498	792499	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" Pity me — if not for myself , for the sake of the innocent child which I bear in my bosom . Tell me what I can do for you — what you require — — "
792539	792546	792548	792548	Lydia	1544	" My views are soon explained , "
792550	792563	792548	792548	Lydia	1544	" I demand permission to remain in the service of your ladyship . "
792564	792573	792575	792575	Adeline	1545	" Oh ! no — no : impossible ! "
792582	792590	792592	792592	Lydia	1544	" It must be as I say , "
792596	792600	792602	792603	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" Insolent menial ! "
792611	792622	792609	792609	herself	1680	" Leave me — quit this house — go — — "
792623	792629	792631	792632	Miss Hutchinson	1551	" Do you dare me ? "
792634	792691	792631	792632	Miss Hutchinson	1551	" I assured your ladyship ere now that it did not suit my present plans to expose you ; because I seek to remain in your service . But , if you essay again to triumph over me — to spurn me from your presence — I will , remorselessly and fearlessly , proclaim the past . "
792692	792699	792701	792701	Adeline	1545	" And who will believe you ? "
792710	792766	792701	792701	Adeline	1545	" who will believe you ? The whole world will denounce you as an impostress . Nay — more : I will punish you — yes , I will punish you for your insolence ! I will declare that you have attempted to extort money from me by means of the most diabolical threats — — "
792767	792783	792785	792785	Lydia	1544	" Think not that I am to be intimidated by your ladyship 's miserable subterfuges , "
792809	792829	792701	792701	Adeline	1545	" Are there no witnesses to speak to collateral faces ? Could Cholmondeley and Dunstable prove nothing against you ? "
792830	792844	792846	792846	Adeline	1545	" They would not raise their voices against a noble lady 's fame , "
792850	792867	792869	792869	Lydia	1544	" They would speak the truth when placed on their oaths in a court of justice , "
792873	792960	792869	792869	Lydia	1544	" for it is to a court of justice that your ladyship threatens to drag me . And now , proud peeress , I dare you to the public investigation ! Throw open the door — summon your domestics — send me to a gaol!—but the day of fair and searching scrutiny must come — and I should await in confidence the reply that a British judge and a British jury would give to the vile calumny of even a lady so highly exalted as yourself ! "
792961	792964	792966	792966	Adeline	1545	" Enough ! "
792985	793026	792869	792869	Lydia	1544	" I accept your challenge — for I well know that I can rely upon the honour of Lord Dunstable and Colonel Cholmondeley . Yes — yes : they would sooner perjure themselves than attaint the honour of a peeress ! "
793027	793036	793038	793038	Lydia	1544	" There is one other consideration , then , "
793044	793062	793038	793038	Lydia	1544	" and perhaps the ingenuity of your ladyship will devise a means of frustrating that test also . "
793063	793070	793072	793072	Adeline	1545	" To what do you allude ? "
793074	793095	793097	793097	Lydia	1544	" I mean that when you summon your domestics to drag me to a gaol on a charge of extortion , "
793101	793131	793097	793097	Lydia	1544	" that moment do I proclaim the history of the past ! Then will medical experience speedily prove whether Lady Ravensworth now bears her first child in her bosom ! "
793196	793200	793202	793202	Adeline	1545	" My husband ! "
793222	793227	793219	793219	she	1545	" Mercy ! mercy ! "
793228	793233	793219	793219	she	1545	" Mercy ! mercy ! "
793262	793265	793270	793270	his	1645	" Rise , "
793302	793337	793270	793270	his	1645	" Rise , madam : this is a subject which can not be disposed of in passionate ejaculations;—it requires a calmer deliberation — for the honour of two noble families is now at stake ! "
793338	793344	793354	793354	she	1545	" Then you know all ! "
793361	793376	793354	793354	she	1545	" Yes — I overheard enough to enable me to comprehend the whole truth , "
793456	793463	793436	793436	he	21509	" Young woman , be seated . "
793483	793486	793488	793489	the nobleman	3005	" Adeline , "
793510	793665	793498	793498	he	21509	" before we enter upon this sad topic , I must in justice to myself observe that I did not seek your chamber to play the eaves - dropper . I felt unwell in the drawing - room ere now , and I retired to my own cabinet to solace myself in the usual manner with the meerschaum . But it struck me that I had been better during all the early part of the morning than for some weeks past ; and , after a long struggle with myself , I resolved to renounce the pipe . On my return to the drawing - room , I heard that you were suddenly indisposed ; and I came hither to inquire after you . But at the moment I reached your door , I overheard words which struck me as with a thunderbolt . Then I listened — and overheard much — too much ! "
793666	793676	793678	793678	Adeline	1545	" And now you hate — you despise me ! "
793682	793703	793704	793704	she	1545	" you will thrust me forth from your dwelling — you will cover me with shame ! No — no , "
793708	793717	793704	793704	she	1545	" death — death before such a fate ! "
793718	793724	793726	793727	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" Calm yourself , Adeline , "
793739	793766	793726	793727	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" I before observed that there is the honour of two families to preserve — that of Rossville and of Ravensworth . Give me your Bible . "
793767	793771	793773	793773	Adeline	1545	" My Bible ! "
793781	793791	793773	793773	Adeline	1545	" Yes — your Bible . Where is it ? "
793792	793797	793799	793799	Adeline	1545	" There — there ! "
793856	793863	793864	793864	he	26711	" Will you swear , Adeline , "
793872	793920	793864	793864	he	26711	tone,—"will you swear upon this volume which contains the Word of God , that the child you now bear in your bosom is mine , and that since your marriage you have never forgotten the fidelity due to a husband ? Will you swear this , Adeline ? "
793921	793928	793929	793929	she	1545	" I will — I will ! "
793955	793960	793962	793963	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" Swear , then , "
793965	793986	793962	793963	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" and invoke God to cast you dead — dead this minute at my feet — if you swear falsely . "
793987	793994	793996	793997	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" I do — I do ! "
794019	794088	794009	794009	she	1680	" I swear , as I hope for future salvation , that I have never been unfaithful , even in thought , to my marriage vow , and that the child I bear in my bosom is my husband 's . This I swear by every thing sacred and holy ; and if I have sworn falsely , may the great God cast me dead at your feet . "
794173	794176	794177	794177	he	1645	" Yes , "
794190	794285	794177	794177	he	1645	thoughts,—"the honour of two families must be preserved ! And , after all,—perhaps I am rightly served ! A man of my years should have sought a partner of a fitting age ; but it is the fault — the error — the curse of elderly men to believe that their rank and wealth warrant them in seeking some young girl who may thus become as it were a victim . Then mothers take advantage of that longing to obtain a wife of comparatively tender years ; and those worldly - minded parents — — "
794286	794297	794299	794299	Adeline	1545	" My lord — my lord , spare my feelings ! "
794305	794317	794177	794177	he	1645	" My mother knew not of her daughter 's frailty — — "
794318	794326	794328	794329	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" Well — enough on that head ! "
794334	794363	794364	794364	he	1645	" The past can not be recalled : let us secure the honour of the future . You have erred in your girlhood , Adeline ! and there , "
794370	794425	794364	794364	he	1645	" is one who knows that sad secret . You have been ungrateful to her — by her accusations and your acknowledgment ; and she holds you in her power . Not you alone:—but she holds your family and mine — for an exposure would create a scandal that must redound upon us all ! "
794426	794445	794447	794447	Lydia	1544	" I have no wish to avail myself of the possession of that secret for such an object , "
794449	794468	794447	794447	Lydia	1544	" I have two motives for desiring to remain at least a year in her ladyship 's service . "
794469	794472	794474	794474	Adeline	1545	" Never ! "
794478	794489	794474	794474	Adeline	1545	" It is you who have made all this mischief ! "
794490	794495	794497	794498	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" Silence , Adeline , "
794511	794521	794508	794508	he	1645	" Young woman , proceed — and speak frankly . "
794522	794546	794548	794548	Lydia	1544	" I stated that I had two objects to serve in being anxious to remain in her ladyship 's service for one year , "
794550	794605	794548	794548	Lydia	1544	" In the first place , I have been so unfortunate — so very , very miserable , that I wish to earn my livelihood by servitude ; and it is my hope to remain here until her ladyship can conscientiously give me such a character as will ensure me a good situation elsewhere . "
794606	794612	794614	794615	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" That is naturally understood , "
794617	794624	794614	794615	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" What is your second motive ? "
794625	794630	794632	794632	Lydia	1544	" My second motive ! "
794641	794660	794632	794632	Lydia	1544	" oh ! that I will explain to her ladyship in private — and she will be satisfied ! "
794661	794667	794669	794670	the nobleman	3005	" Now listen to me , "
794672	794715	794669	794670	the nobleman	3005	" Lady Ravensworth dislikes the idea that you should remain here . I will give you the means of settling yourself comfortably for life , if you will leave forthwith , and promise solemnly to preserve that fatal secret which you possess . "
794716	794720	794722	794722	Lydia	1544	" My lord , "
794728	794807	794722	794722	Lydia	1544	" I return you my most sincere thanks for that bounteous offer which I am compelled to decline . Were I to accept your lordship 's conditions , my aims would not be answered . In respect to my first object , I have determined to earn a character that may to some extent retrieve the past;—for , as your lordship must have gathered from the conversation which you overheard , I have been unfortunate — very unfortunate ! "
794808	794812	794814	794814	Adeline	1545	" Merciful heavens ! "
794816	794843	794814	794814	Adeline	1545	" how can I retain you in my service ? You have belonged to a class — oh ! no — it is impossible — impossible ! "
794844	794857	794859	794860	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" I do not wish to insult your feelings , young woman , "
794862	794903	794859	794860	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" especially since you manifest so praiseworthy a desire to retrieve your character . But you must perceive the impossibility , as her ladyship observes , of retaining you in our service . You might be known — recognised — — "
794904	794910	794912	794912	Lydia	1544	" I understand your lordship , "
794916	795001	794912	794912	Lydia	1544	" I might be recognised as an unhappy creature who had once earned a livelihood by parading the public streets . That is scarcely probable:—I am much changed since then . The kindness of an excellent lady has enabled me to recruit my strength and to recover a healthy appearance . Yes — I must be altered ; for your lordship does not perceive in me the poor miserable starving wretch who some few months since accosted her ladyship in Saint James 's Street . "
795002	795008	795010	795011	the nobleman	3005	" Ah ! I recollect , "
795021	795129	795010	795011	the nobleman	3005	" I only observed you for a moment on that occasion ; but still — so miserable was your appearance — it made an impression on my mind . Yes — you are indeed changed ! Nevertheless , those who saw you in an unhappy career , before you became so reduced as you were on the occasion which you have mentioned , might recognise you . And — pardon my frankness , young woman ; but the subject admits not of the measurement of words — what would be thought of me — of my wife — of all the other members of my household — — "
795130	795144	795146	795146	Lydia	1544	" If I were seen in your establishment , your lordship would add , "
795148	795221	795146	795146	Lydia	1544	" I admit the truth of all your lordship states : still my wish to remain a member of that establishment is unchanged . For — as your lordship may have ere now gathered from our conversation — it was her ladyship who first placed me in those paths which led to my ruin ; and it must be her ladyship who shall aid me in earning an honourable character once more . "
795222	795230	795232	795232	Adeline	1545	" But this punishment is too severe ! "
795255	795268	795270	795271	the nobleman	3005	" Consider , I implore you , the position of my wife , "
795273	795284	795270	795271	the nobleman	3005	" in a few weeks she will become a mother ! "
795285	795311	795313	795313	Lydia	1544	" My lord , her ladyship never had any consideration for me , from the first moment that I ceased to be useful to her , "
795319	795342	795313	795313	Lydia	1544	" and I can not consent to sacrifice what I consider to be my own interests to her ladyship 's wishes now . "
795378	795391	795393	795394	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" It must be so , then — it must be so , "
795407	795438	795402	795402	he	1645	" You shall have an apartment in my establishment and handsome wages:—all I exact is that you do not force your attentions on her ladyship save when she demands them . "
795439	795458	795460	795460	Lydia	1544	" If I remain here , it must be in the capacity of her ladyship 's principal attendant , "
795462	795483	795460	795460	Lydia	1544	" otherwise I could not fairly earn a good character in the eyes of the other dependants of your lordship . "
795484	795490	795492	795493	the nobleman	3005	" Perdition ! young woman , "
795495	795501	795492	795493	the nobleman	3005	" you demand too much ! "
795502	795510	795512	795513	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" More than I will ever concede , "
795529	795541	795543	795543	she	1544	" Then your lordship will permit me to take my departure , "
795554	795564	795548	795548	she	1544	" My God ! she will reveal every thing ! "
795570	795576	795578	795578	Lydia	1544	" Yes — every thing , "
795594	795605	795607	795608	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" Stay , young woman — this may not be ! "
795610	795620	795607	795608	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" You exercise your power with a fearful despotism . "
795621	795635	795578	795578	Lydia	1544	" The world has been a fearful despot towards me , my lord , "
795643	795663	795665	795666	the nobleman	3005	" And with your tyranny in this respect you will kill my wife — kill my yet unborn child ! "
795683	795846	795665	795666	the nobleman	3005	" But the honour of the Rossvilles and the Ravensworths must be preserved — at any sacrifice — at any risk!—Yes — though you bring misery into this house , here must you remain — since such is your inflexible will . Were an exposure to take place , the consequences — my God ! would be awful — crushing ! The finger of ridicule and scorn would point at me — the elderly man who espoused the young and beautiful girl , and who was so proud that he had won her for a wife ! And then — should the child of which she is so soon to become a mother , prove a son — although the law would recognise him as the heir to my name and fortune , yet the scandalous world would throw doubts , perhaps , on his legitimacy . Ah ! the thought is maddening ! And my brother — my brother too — — "
795903	795912	795913	795913	she	27679	" Oh ! God have mercy upon me ! "
795928	795944	795913	795913	she	27679	" how dearly — dearly am I now paying for the errors of my youth ! "
795945	795955	795957	795958	the nobleman	3005	" Does that sight not move you , woman ? "
795979	796011	795965	795965	he	3005	" My lord , I lost all by serving the interests of her who is now Lady Ravensworth ; and it is time that I should think only of my own . "
796043	796062	796064	796065	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" Then be it all as you say — be it all as you wish , despotic woman ! "
796067	796090	796064	796065	Lord Ravensworth	1645	" Remain here — command us all — drive us to despair — for our honour is unhappily in your remorseless hands . "
796159	796170	796171	796171	she	1680	" He is gone — and you are still there ! "
796181	796216	796171	796171	she	1680	" Now we are alone together — and doubtless I am to look upon you as one determined to drive me to despair . What other motive had you for insisting upon remaining here ? "
796217	796226	796228	796228	Lydia	1544	" Lady , I will now explain myself , "
796235	796286	796228	796228	Lydia	1544	" It pierced me to the heart to cause so much grief to that good nobleman , of whom you are so utterly unworthy ; but for you I have no kind consideration — no mercy . Adeline , I hate you — I loathe you — I detest you ! "
796287	796291	796293	796294	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" Merciful heavens ! "
796296	796307	796293	796294	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" and you are to be constantly about my person ! "
796308	796323	796325	796325	Lydia	1544	" Yes : and my second motive for remaining here to enjoy that privilege , "
796329	796333	796325	796325	Lydia	1544	" is vengeance ! "
796334	796337	796339	796339	Adeline	1545	" Vengeance ! "
796357	796362	796364	796365	Lydia Hutchinson	1544	" Vengeance — vengeance ! "
796367	796419	796364	796365	Lydia Hutchinson	1544	" Before the rest of the world I shall appear the humble and respectful dependant — yes , even in the presence of your husband . But when alone with you , I shall prove a very demon , whose weapons are galling reproaches , ignominies , insults , and indignities . "
796420	796427	796429	796429	Adeline	1545	" Oh ! this is terrible ! "
796439	796448	796429	796429	Adeline	1545	" You can not be such a fiend . "
796449	796456	796458	796458	Lydia	1544	" I can — I will ! "
796460	796924	796458	796458	Lydia	1544	" Have I not undergone enough to make me so ? And all was occasioned by you ! When I was your wretched tool , you promised me the affection of a sister ; and how did you fulfil your pledge ? You came to me at a house where I was a governess , and whence I was anxious to remove from the importunities of the master ; and there you threw off the mask . I then saw the hollowness of your soul . My father died of a broken heart , and my brother perished in a duel , in consequence of my iniquity . But who had made me criminal ? You ! I called upon you at Rossville House at a time when a little sympathy on your part might have still saved me ; for I should have felt that I had one friend still left . But you scorned me — you even menaced me ; and I then warned you that I was absolved from all motives of secrecy on your account . Your black ingratitude drove me to despair ; and I immediately afterwards fell to the lowest grade in the social sphere — that of a prostitute ! Yes — for I need use no nice language with you . All the miseries I endured in my wretched career I charge upon your head . And ere now you menaced me again : you threatened to accuse me falsely of a crime that would render me amenable to the criminal tribunals of the country . It only required that to fill the cup of your base ingratitude to the very brim . And think you that your malignant — your spiteful glances,—your looks of bitter , burning hate,—were lost upon me ? No — you would doubtless assassinate me , if you dared ! Oh ! I have long detested you — long loathed your very name ! But , never — never , until we met in this room ere now , did I believe that my hatred against you was so virulent as it is . And never — never until this hour did I appreciate the sweets of vengeance . At present I can revel in those feelings:—I can wreak upon you — and I will — that revenge which my own miseries and the death of those whom I held dear have excited in my heart ! Your ladyship now knows the terms of our connexion , for one year ; and at the expiration of that period you will be glad — Oh ! too glad to rid yourself of me by giving me a character that will never fail to procure for me a place in future . "
797504	797523	797497	797497	he	3220	" By all the powers of hell ! I 'll find means to cure you of this obstinacy . "
797534	797542	797544	797546	the Resurrection Man	952	" Then try another night of it ! "
797635	797646	797620	797624	a person in the street	21582	" Mr. Tidkins ! Mr. Tidkins ! is that you ? "
797647	797651	797653	797655	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Rather so , "
797664	797671	797653	797655	the Resurrection Man	3220	" walk up , Mr. Tomlinson . "
797672	797683	797685	797688	the stock - broker	4179	" I — I — if you have no objection , "
797698	797726	797685	797688	the stock - broker	4179	" I would much prefer — that is , I should like to speak to you down here ; because my time is precious — and — — "
797727	797738	797740	797742	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And you are afraid to trust yourself with me , "
797746	797813	797740	797742	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Why , what an infernal fool you must be ! I do n't suppose that you 've come with your pockets full of gold : and , if you have n't , you certainly ai n't worth robbing and murdering . So , walk up , I say — and no more of this gammon . Shut the door , and bolt it after you . "
797926	797939	797941	797941	Tidkins	998	" Sit down , and do n't be afraid , Mr. Tomlinson , "
797943	797971	797941	797941	Tidkins	998	" There , sir — draw near the fire ; and here 's brandy , rum , or gin , if you like to take any thing . "
797972	797979	797981	797984	the stock - broker	4179	" Nothing , I thank you , "
798001	798022	797981	797984	the stock - broker	4179	" You wrote to desire me to call this evening — at seven o'clock — or I might repent — — "
798023	798034	798036	798038	the Resurrection Man	952	" Yes — and so you would repent the consequences , "
798040	798095	798036	798038	the Resurrection Man	952	" But , as you have come , it is all right . I dare say you thought I had forgotten you : you were deceived , you see ; for I never lose sight of old friends . When I want to use them , I am sure to find them out again . "
798096	798108	798110	798113	the stock - broker	4179	" And what can I do for you , Mr. Tidkins ? "
798156	798169	798171	798173	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I have but two wants in the world at any time , "
798179	798199	798171	798173	the Resurrection Man	3220	" money most often — vengeance now and then . But it is money that I want of you . "
798200	798205	798207	798207	Tomlinson	1005	" Money — money ! "
798209	798230	798207	798207	Tomlinson	1005	" do you think I am made of money ? I have had hard struggles — losses — expenses — — "
798231	798238	798240	798242	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I dare say you have , "
798246	798337	798240	798242	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I do not mean to be hard upon you ; but something I must have . You see , I have got a little amount put by — how obtained is neither here nor there ; and I want to scrape together as much as I can , so that in a few months , when I have settled the different matters I have on hand , I may leave England for America , or some such place ; and then you will never hear of me any more . "
798338	798346	798348	798348	Tomlinson	1005	" That will be a great blessing , "
798357	798375	798377	798379	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And under all circumstances , you must help me to make up the sum I want , "
798381	798392	798394	798394	Tomlinson	1005	" You are too hard upon me , Mr. Tidkins , "
798396	798414	798394	798394	Tomlinson	1005	" If I had employed you on any business , it would be different : but — — "
798415	798434	798436	798436	Tidkins	998	" But if you have a secret that I have found out , and that 's worth keeping ? "
798440	798450	798452	798452	Tomlinson	1005	" Oh ! then it is as I feared ! "
798481	798504	798394	798394	Tomlinson	1005	" Surely this man must be Satan himself , who comes at intervals to goad the wicked to desperation for their sins ! "
798505	798514	798516	798516	Tidkins	998	" What 's that you say about Satan ? "
798518	798523	798525	798528	the stock - broker	4179	" Nothing — nothing , "
798532	798548	798525	798528	the stock - broker	4179	" I was only thinking to myself that Satan took a delight in persecuting me . "
798549	798556	798558	798560	the Resurrection Man	952	" I know nothing about that , "
798562	798589	798558	798560	the Resurrection Man	952	" All I care for is the cash that you will have the goodness to bring me down to - morrow evening at this same hour . "
798656	798667	798669	798672	the stock - broker	4179	" But wherefore should you press me in this way ? "
798674	798686	798669	798672	the stock - broker	4179	" Did I not satisfy your demands on a former occasion ? "
798687	798696	798698	798698	Tidkins	998	" And have I not kept my pledge ? "
798700	798730	798698	798698	Tidkins	998	" Has a word ever escaped my lips to do you an injury ? Why , there is still a reward of three thousand pounds to be got — — "
798731	798736	798738	798738	Tomlinson	1005	" No — no , "
798740	798764	798738	798738	Tomlinson	1005	" you are wrong . My affairs are all wound up in respect to the bank — and a dividend has been paid . "
798765	798776	798778	798778	Tidkins	998	" A precious small one , I 'll be bound , "
798780	798823	798778	798778	Tidkins	998	" However,—reward or no reward,—it would n't place you in a very comfortable situation if I was to take a policeman with me , and just call at a particular house in Thomas Street , where an old gentleman named Nelson — — "
798824	798827	798829	798829	Tomlinson	1005	" Enough ! "
798831	798859	798829	798829	Tomlinson	1005	" I see you know all . My God ! when shall I be released from this peril ? when shall I know a moment 's comfort ? "
798860	798877	798879	798881	the Resurrection Man	3220	" When you 've brought me down a couple of hundred pounds to - morrow night , "
798891	798916	798888	798888	his	3220	" And , then — if you like to make it worth my while — I tell you what I 'll do for you . "
798917	798920	798922	798925	the stock - broker	4179	" What ? "
798931	798973	798975	798977	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I 'll entice the old fellow down here , and either lock him up in one of my cells , or else settle his hash in such a way that he shall only be fit to sell to the surgeons , "
799005	799008	799010	799010	Tomlinson	1005	" Monster ! "
799049	799096	799023	799023	he	1005	" no — never will I imbrue my hands with blood , nor suborn another to play the assassin 's part for me ! To - morrow evening you shall receive the amount you demand ; and heaven grant that all connexion between us may cease . "
799097	799102	799104	799106	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Be it so , "
799119	799129	799131	799131	Tomlinson	1005	" You have nothing more to say to me ? "
799323	799328	799329	799329	he	1005	" Who is it ? "
799336	799339	799351	799353	the Lully Prig	41139	" Me , "
799380	799384	799376	799378	the Resurrection Man	3220	" What news ? "
799385	799391	799376	799378	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Just as you wished , "
799396	799710	799376	799378	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I called at the chandlery shop in Pitfield Street , Hoxton , and axed for a nounce of bakker . The woman served me ; and I soon see that she was alone . Then says I , ' If so be no one 's within ' earing , I want a word with you . '—She looked frightened , but said nothing wotsomever.—'All I have to tell you is just this , ' says I : ' Tony Tidkins knows where you be and all about you . But he says , says he , that if you take no notice of him in case you sees him , and says nothing to nobody in case you ' ears of him , he 'll leave you alone . '—Lor ! how she did turn pale and tremble when I mentioned your name ; and she seemed so glad when I told her that you would n't do her no harm , if so be she did n't try to do you none.—'If he wo n't come near me , I 'll never even breathe his name , ' she says.—'And you 'll never utter a word about the crib in Globe Town , ' says I.—'Never , never , ' says she.—'Well , then , ' says I , ' all will go on well ; and you can sleep as sound in your bed as if there was n't such a man as Tony Tidkins in the world . But if so be you peaches , or says a word , ' says I , ' that may get Tony into trouble , he 's got plenty of friends as will awenge him , and the fust is me . '—So she swore eyes and limbs , she 'd keep all close ; and in that way I left her . "
799711	799718	799720	799722	the Resurrection Man	952	" So far , so good , "
799724	799792	799720	799722	the Resurrection Man	952	" She 's frightened , and will keep a close tongue . That 's all I want . When I have finished the different things I have in hand , and do n't care about staying in London any longer , I will punish her for what she did to me . But my revenge will keep for the present . Now , what about Crankey Jem ? "
799793	799811	799813	799815	the Lully Prig	1487	" He still lives in the court in Drury Lane , and stays at home all day , "
799817	799857	799813	799815	the Lully Prig	1487	" But at night he goes out for some hours , and I ca n't find out where . For three evenin 's follering I watched him ; and every time I missed him at last somehow or another . "
799858	799865	799867	799869	the Resurrection Man	952	" Which way did he go ? "
799871	799912	799867	799869	the Resurrection Man	952	" Different ways — but always up one street and down another — now here , then there , as if he had n't no partickler motive , but merely went out a walkin ' for the fun of it . "
799913	799923	799925	799927	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I tell you what it is , Lully , "
799931	800011	799925	799927	the Resurrection Man	3220	" you 're not so wide awake as I am . That fellow has some object in wandering about zigzag and crosswise in that manner . He has got a scent of me ; and he 's following it up . But at the same time he 's afraid that I may have a scent of him ; and so he dodges about . It 's as clear as day - light—'cause it 's just what I should do . "
800012	800023	800025	800027	the Lully Prig	1487	" And you 're a downy cove enough , Tony , "
800029	800053	800025	800027	the Lully Prig	1487	" although I do think arter all you 've let that damned parley - woo French feller do us about them Bank notes . "
800054	800065	800067	800069	the Resurrection Man	952	" It 's very strange the Buffer does n't return , "
800071	800127	800067	800069	the Resurrection Man	952	" I 'd take my davy that he would n't chouse us out of our reglars . But time will show . Now look here , Lully,—as you 've made that same remark a dozen times since the thing took place,—and just see how the matter stood . We got four thousand pounds clear — — "
800128	800137	800139	800141	the Lully Prig	1487	" Yes — a thousand a - piece , "
800145	800154	800139	800141	the Lully Prig	1487	" and a precious jolly catch it was . "
800155	800158	800067	800069	the Resurrection Man	952	" Well , "
800164	800293	800318	800320	the Lully Prig	41139	" the Bank notes were of no more use to us than so much waste paper , because Greenwood was sure to stop them the moment he got back to London : at least I should think so . Now when that French fellow Lafleur offered to let you , me , the Buffer , and Long Bob share the gold , and he would go to France to smash the notes at the money - changer 's that he told us about in Paris , and then take his thousand beyond his fifth share of the produce of the notes , it was the best thing we could do to accept his proposal — particularly as he said that any one of us might go with him . "
800294	800316	800318	800320	the Lully Prig	41139	" But if he sticks to the whole sixteen thousand pounds , what a deuced good pull he has over us , "
800322	800327	800329	800331	the Resurrection Man	3220	" So he has , "
800333	800428	800443	800445	the Lully Prig	1487	" and again I tell you that if he had n't offered to go to France and change the notes , we must have destroyed them in the very chalk - pit where we divided the swag . They were no use to us — but a great danger . It was better to trust to the chance of Lafleur doing the thing that 's right ; and if he do n't , the Buffer will drop down on him , in spite of all the guilloteens and Johnny - darmies[33 ] in France . "
800429	800441	800443	800445	the Lully Prig	1487	" Well , we wo n't quarrel about it , Tony , "
800447	800505	800443	800445	the Lully Prig	1487	" You and the Buffer let me in for a good thing ; and I ought not to grumble . You see , I 've follered your advice , and kept the blunt in a safe place , without wasting it as Long Bob is doing . He 's never been sober since the thing took place . "
800506	800512	800514	800516	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Where is he now ? "
800518	800540	800542	800544	the Lully Prig	1487	" Oh ! he 's knocking about at all the flash cribs , spending his tin as fast as he can , "
800546	800561	800563	800563	Tidkins	1061	" Do n't let him know of this place of mine for the world , "
800565	800603	800563	800563	Tidkins	1061	" A drunken chap like that is n't to be trusted in any shape . I only hope he wo n't wag his tongue too free about the business that put all the money into his pocket . "
800604	800608	800610	800612	the Lully Prig	1487	" Not he ! "
800614	800685	800610	800612	the Lully Prig	1487	" he 's as close as the door of Newgate about them kind of things , even when he 's as drunk as a pig . But I do n't want to have nothing more to do with him ; I 'll stick to you and the Buffer ; and when you 've settled all the things you say you have in hand , we 'll be off to Americky . "
800686	800729	800731	800733	the Resurrection Man	3220	" So we will , Lully . But this fellow Crankey Jem annoys me . You must go on watching him . Or p'rhaps it would be better to get the Bully Grand to set some of his Forty Thieves after him ? "
800735	800740	800743	800744	Lully Prig	1487	" No — no , "
800773	800794	800762	800762	his	1487	" leave him in my hands , and I 'll find out what dodge he 's upon sooner or later . "
800844	800849	800840	800841	the Buffer	29668	" It is me . "
800850	800856	800858	800860	the Resurrection Man	952	" Well — what luck ? "
800887	800896	800898	800899	the Buffer	29668	" Sold — regularly sold — done brown ! "
800909	800912	800914	800916	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Damnation ! "
800964	800972	800974	800975	the Buffer	29668	" You may well swear , Tony , "
800985	801008	800974	800975	the Buffer	29668	" for we never was so completely done in all our lives . That snivelling Mounseer was one too many for us . "
801009	801018	801020	801022	the Lully Prig	1487	" Ah ! I see how it is , "
801036	801056	800974	800975	the Buffer	29668	" and I ca n't say it 's more than I expected . But how did he do it ? "
801057	801068	801070	801071	the Buffer	29668	" Why , he gave me the slip at last , "
801098	801195	801196	801196	We	21646	" You see , he kept me humbugging about in Paris week after week , always saying that it was n't prudent to begin smashing the notes yet awhile ; and I stuck to him like a leech . I sha n't make a long story on it now — I'm too vexed : all I 'll tell you at present is that four days ago he gave me the slip ; and so I twigged that it was all gammon . He 'd done us brown — that was wery clear;—and so I come back . "
801440	801442	801403	801405	Mr. Alderman Sniff	1315	" success "
801493	801504	801506	801506	Tomlinson	1005	" But how have you managed to do it all ? "
801530	801541	801543	801544	the Alderman	4208	" You see I began life with plenty of money , "
801546	801728	801543	801544	the Alderman	4208	" I mean I had a decent fortune at the death of my father , which took place when I was about two - and - twenty . But that soon went ; and I was glad to accept an offer to go out to India . On my arrival at Madras I was inducted into a situation as clerk in a mercantile establishment ; and there I was making some little money , when I was foolish enough to issue a prospectus for the ' General Boa - Constrictor Killing and Wild Beast Extirpation Joint - Stock Company,'—a project which was not so well relished as I could have wished . My employers discharged me ; and , deeply disgusted with the ignorance of the English settlers and the natives , who could not understand the magnitude of my designs , I came back to England . My trip to India was , however , very useful to me ; for , on my return to this country , I lived splendidly on the Deccan Prize Money for four years . "
801729	801737	801739	801739	Tomlinson	1005	" Lived on the Deccan Prize Money ! "
801741	801753	801739	801739	Tomlinson	1005	" why — what claim had you to any of it ? "
801754	801757	801759	801760	Mr. Sniff	1315	" None , "
801762	802138	801759	801760	Mr. Sniff	1315	" I never was in the Deccan in my life . But I declared that I had claims to I ca n't remember how many lacs of rupees ; and it was very easy to obtain loans from friends and get bills cashed on the strength of the assertion . Of course this had an end : the settlement of the Deccan Prize Money affairs was interminable ; but the facility for procuring cash on the strength of it was not equally lasting . However,—as I just now observed,—I lived comfortably on my alleged claims for four years ; and then I started the ' Universal Poor Man 's Corn - Plaster and Blister Gratuitous Distribution Society . ' I got several philanthropic and worthy men to join me in this laudable undertaking : we took splendid offices in King Street , Cheapside ; and the enterprise progressed wonderfully . How well I remember our first annual meeting at Exeter Hall ! The great room was crowded to excess . I was the Secretary , and it was my duty to read the Report of the Committee . That document had been drawn up in most pathetic language by some poor devil of an author whom I employed for the purpose ; and it produced a wonderful effect . It was really quite touching to see how the ladies — poor dear creatures!—wept tears of the most refreshing philanthropy , when I enumerated the blessings which this Society had conferred upon vast numbers of individuals . Nine thousand six hundred and sixty - seven Corn - Plasters and eleven thousand two hundred and fourteen Blisters had been distributed gratuitously , during the year , to as many poor suffering creatures , who had all been thereby cured of corns previously deemed inveterate , and of chest - complaints that until then had received no medical attention . The Report dwelt upon the gratitude of thousands of poor families for the relief thus dispensed , and congratulated the members of the Society on the claims they possessed to the applause of the whole Christian world . Subscriptions rained in upon me in perfect torrents ; and there was not a tearless eye throughout that vast hall . "
802139	802151	802153	802153	Tomlinson	1005	" How was it that so excellent an institution became extinct ? "
802164	802172	802160	802161	the Alderman	4208	" I really can scarce tell you , "
802177	802417	802160	802161	the Alderman	4208	" Whether it was that the public thought there could not possibly be any more corns to cure or pulmonary complaints to heal,—or whether it was in consequence of a proposition which I made , in an unlucky hour , to extend the benefits of the Society to the poor savages in the islands of the Pacific,—I ca n't say : it is , however , certain that the subscribers were very ' backward in coming forward ' at the third annual meeting ; and so the institution dwindled into nothing . I had , nevertheless , saved some little money ; and I was not long idle . My next spec . was ' The Metropolitan Poor Family 's Sunday - Dinner Gratuitous Baking Association . ' You perceive that I am fond of dealing in humane and philanthropic enterprises . My idea was to establish numerous baking - houses all over London , and to cook the poor man 's Sunday joint and potatoes for him , the Society reserving to itself the dripping , which being sold , and the profits added to the voluntary subscriptions received from the charitable , would support these most useful institutions . At the end of a year , however , I was compelled to dissolve the Association , after having gone to the expense of building no less than sixty enormous ovens in as many different parts of London . "
802418	802426	802428	802428	Tomlinson	1005	" How came that project to fail , "
802430	802442	802428	802428	Tomlinson	1005	" when it was calculated to benefit so many poor families ? "
802443	802462	802464	802465	Alderman Sniff	1315	" Simply because so few of those poor families ever had any Sunday dinners to cook at all , "
802467	802513	802515	802516	the philanthropist	37564	" Nevertheless , the subscriptions which were received paid all the outlay , and remunerated me for my trouble . I therefore met with some little encouragement in all I did for the benefit of my fellow - creatures ; and , more than that , "
802523	802536	802515	802516	the philanthropist	37564	" I enjoyed the approval , Mr. Tomlinson , of my conscience . "
802575	802577	802515	802516	the philanthropist	37564	" Conscience "
802588	802605	802607	802608	Alderman Sniff	1315	" While I was thus engaged in the behoof of the poorer classes of the community , "
802610	802817	802607	802608	Alderman Sniff	1315	" I was gaining influence with my fellow citizens . I became the Treasurer of no end of charitable institutions , was elected Churchwarden of my parish , and soon became Deputy of the Ward . Fortunately my parish , as you well know , is governed by a Select Vestry — properly consisting of three individuals ; but as two of the last - elected trio have died , and as I have ever stedfastly and successfully opposed the nomination of other parishioners to replace the deceased , we have now a Select Vestry of One . This gentleman is my most intimate friend ; and it would do your heart good to see the parochial solemnity and official dignity with which he annually proposes me to himself as a candidate for the place of Churchwarden , and then proceeds to second the nomination , put the question , lift up his hand , and declare me duly elected without a dissentient voice . In due time I was chosen Alderman of the Ward ; and every thing has gone well with me . I have been eminently successful . My ' British Marble Company ' was a glorious hit , as you well know . "
802818	802827	802829	802829	Tomlinson	1005	" Yes — a glorious hit for you , "
802836	802889	802829	802829	Tomlinson	1005	" You yourself were Managing Director , and you sold your quarry — or rather your supposed quarry — to yourself;—you were Auditor and Secretary , and consequently examined and passed your own accounts;—you were also the Treasurer , and paid yourself . You had the best of it in every way . "
802890	802896	802898	802898	Sniff	1315	" Come , Mr. Tomlinson , "
802903	802925	802898	802898	Sniff	1315	" I allowed you to reap a decent profit on the shares which you sold ; so you need not complain . "
802926	802934	802936	802939	the stock - broker	4179	" Oh ! I do not complain , "
802941	802955	802936	802939	the stock - broker	4179	" But how do you get on with the accounts of your parish ? "
802956	802960	802962	802963	the Alderman	4208	" Mr. Tomlinson , "
802968	803016	803023	803023	his	21669	" I never will give any accounts at all to those refractory parishioners of mine . The Select Vestry of One has met regularly every year , and resolved himself into a Committee to investigate my accounts — and that is sufficient . And , after all , "
803030	803073	803023	803023	his	21669	" even if the accounts were produced,—although they run over such a long period of years , you might put them all into your waistcoat - pocket without finding it stick out more than it now does with your small French watch . "[34
803127	803132	803133	803133	he	903	" My dear Tomlinson , "
803136	803172	803133	803133	he	903	" I am quite delighted to find you within . I have made a hit , and shall retrieve myself with ease . The ten thousand pounds which Holmesford lent me are now twenty thousand . "
803173	803180	803182	803182	Tomlinson	1005	" You are a lucky fellow , "
803188	803201	803182	803182	Tomlinson	1005	" Adversity has no effect upon you ; whereas with me — — "
803202	803211	803213	803213	Greenwood	903	" Why — what is the matter now ? "
803215	803219	803213	803213	Greenwood	903	" Always complaining ? "
803220	803228	803230	803233	the stock - broker	4179	" I have good cause for annoyance , "
803235	803243	803230	803233	the stock - broker	4179	" That precious acquaintance of yours — — "
803244	803247	803249	803249	Greenwood	903	" Who ? "
803253	803290	803182	803182	Tomlinson	1005	" The lunatic - asylum keeper , as your friend Chichester supposed him to be — but the resurrectionist , thief , extortioner , villain , and perhaps murderer , as I take him to be , "
803292	803312	803230	803233	the stock - broker	4179	Tomlinson,—"that scoundrel Tidkins , in a word , has discovered poor old Michael 's address , and menaces me . "
803313	803316	803318	803318	Greenwood	903	" Ah ! "
803322	803361	803318	803318	Greenwood	903	" it is your own fault : you should have got Martin out of the way — even if you had painted him black , shipped him to the United States , and sold him as a slave . "
803362	803365	803367	803367	Tomlinson	1005	" Ridiculous ! "
803371	803391	803367	803367	Tomlinson	1005	" I never will cease to be a friend — a grateful friend — to that poor old man . "
803392	803395	803397	803397	Greenwood	903	" Well , "

804255	804315	804237	804237	you	0	" observed the stock - broker , coolly . Greenwood made no reply , but remained plunged in a deep reverie , the subject of which was the brilliant destiny that appeared to await Richard Markham . As soon as he had taken his leave , Tomlinson also began musing ; but it was upon a far different topic ! "
804328	804334	804338	804338	he	903	" he said within himself : "
804380	804404	804354	804354	Greenwood	903	" cried Tomlinson , aloud , as a sudden idea was created in his mind by the mention of the name of that glorious Republic:—"and
804598	804607	804592	804592	He	903	" continued the stock - broker , bitterly , "
804693	805312	804683	804683	I	0	" Tomlinson 's resolution was now irrevocably fixed . He would emigrate to the United States , accompanied by his faithful old clerk ! Greenwood 's money should constitute the principal resource to which he must trust as the basis whereon to establish a fortune in the place of the one he had lost . Nor did he hesitate a moment — weak , timid , and vacillating as he was in ordinary circumstances — to self - appropriate those funds thus entrusted to him . He had no sympathy for Greenwood;—and , moreover , he had many an act of insolence on the part of that individual — many an instance of oppression , to avenge . Ere the failure of the bank , Greenwood had taken advantage of his necessities to wring from him enormous interest for loans advanced , and had , moreover , made him his instrument in defrauding the Italian prince . Since the establishment of the office in Tokenhouse Yard , Greenwood had continued to use Tomlinson as a tool so long as his own fortunes had remained prosperous;—and even latterly — since the condition of Greenwood 's finances had levelled some of those barriers which the necessities of the one and the wealth of the other had originally raised between them,—even latterly , the manner of the Member of Parliament towards the fallen banker had been that of patronage and superiority . Then the frequent and heartless allusions which Greenwood made to the poor old clerk , rankled deeply in the mind of Tomlinson ; and all these circumstances armed that naturally weak and timid man with a giant strength of mind when he contemplated the possibility of at length punishing Greenwood for a thousand insults . Tomlinson was not naturally a vindictive man:—persons of his quiet and timid disposition seldom are . But there are certain affronts which , when oft repeated and dwelt upon in their aggregate , form a motive power that will arouse the most enduring and the weakest mind to action — especially , too , when accident throws a special opportunity of vengeance in the way . James Tomlinson was a strange compound of good and bad qualities — the latter arising from his constitutional want of nerve , and his deficiency in moral energy . Had he been mentally resolute , he would have proved a good and great man . The conflicting elements of his character were signally demonstrated on this occasion , when he had determined to fly from the country . Having given his clerks positive orders that he was not to be interrupted for some hours , he sealed up in different parcels the small sums of money which his various clients had placed in his hands to purchase scrip or other securities , and addressed the packets to those to whom the sums respectively belonged,—omitting , however , Greenwood in this category . He next computed the salaries due to his clerks , and set apart the amount required to liquidate those obligations also . These duties being accomplished , he locked all the parcels up in one of the drawers of his writing - table , and placed the key in his pocket . Greenwood 's deposit he secured about his person . When it grew dusk in the evening , he repaired to the lodging which Michael Martin occupied in Bethnal Green . As soon as Tomlinson had made known his scheme to the old man—(but , of course , without betraying the fact of his intention to self - appropriate Greenwood 's money)—Michael took a huge pinch of snuff , and reflected profoundly for some minutes . "
805325	805422	804683	804683	I	0	" demanded the ex - cashier at length . Tomlinson explained , with great frankness , that the Resurrection Man had by some means discovered the secret of Michael 's abode , and was again playing the part of an extortioner . He , moreover , expressed his invincible dislike for a city where he had experienced such painful reverses ; and declared his resolution of no longer living in such a state of suspense and anxiety as he was kept in by the constant dread of an exposure in respect to his faithful old clerk . "
805432	805438	805423	805423	You	21705	" said Martin , gruffly : "

805458	805467	805444	805444	my	0	" asked Tomlinson , with a foreboding shudder . "

805521	805522	805495	805495	you	21705	" "
805526	805535	805495	805495	you	21705	" exclaimed Tomlinson , wiping away a tear : "

805563	805582	805542	805547	My good — faithful old friend	21706	" said Michael , who was obliged to take several pinches of snuff to conceal his own emotions : "
805611	805624	805608	805608	I	0	" he added , more hastily than he was accustomed to speak . "
805632	805649	805650	805650	We	21707	" said Tomlinson , rejoiced at this assent which he had wrung from his faithful servitor . "
805688	805689	805608	805608	I	0	" "
805697	805702	805608	805608	I	0	" said old Martin ; "
805714	805715	805704	805704	you	21705	" "
805718	805722	805704	805704	you	21705	" replied Tomlinson ; "
805740	806024	805734	805734	We	21707	" The advice of the stock - broker was acted upon ; and the fugitives succeeded in leaving the kingdom in safety . But that night the Resurrection Man vainly awaited the arrival of James Tomlinson . And on the following day , Mr. Greenwood discovered , to his cost , that the effects of those lessons of duplicity and dishonour which he had inculcated in respect to the stock - broker , practically redounded upon himself ! It was midnight . In a garret , belonging to a house in the same court where Crankey Jem resided , sate Henry Holford . He was alone . His elbow rested on the table , and his hand supported his feverish head — for dark thoughts filled the brain of that young man . The flickering light of a single candle fell upon the pages of an old volume , which he was reading with intense interest . His cheeks were pale,—his lips were dry,—his throat was parched,—and his eye - balls glared with unnatural lustre . He did not feel athirst — else there was water handy to assuage the craving:—nor did he hear his heart beating violently , nor experience the feverish and rapid throbbing of his temples . No:—his whole thoughts — his entire feelings — his every sensation,—all were absorbed in the subject of his study . And that the reader may fully comprehend the nature of those impulses which were now urging this strange young man on to the perpetration of a deed that was destined to give a terrible celebrity to his name , we must quote the passage on which his mind was so intently fixed : — "
806035	806409	806025	806029	THE ASSASSINATION OF GUSTAVUS III	21709	" The nobles were discontented with the general conduct of the King ; and a conspiracy was planned against him under his own roof . His wars had compelled him to negotiate large loans , and to impose upon his subjects heavy taxes . The nobles took advantage of that circumstance to prejudice the minds of many of the people against the sovereign who had laboured so long for their real good . On the 16th of March , 1792 , he received an anonymous letter , warning him of his immediate danger from a plot that was laid to take away his life , requesting him to remain at home , and avoid balls for a year ; and assuring him , that if he should go to the masquerade for which he was preparing , he would be assassinated that very night . The King read the note with contempt , and at a late hour entered the ball - room . After some time he sat down in a box with the Count of Essen , and observed he was not deceived in his contempt for the letter , since , had there been any design against his life , no time could be more favourable than that moment . He then mingled , without apprehension , among the crowd ; and just as he was preparing to retire with the Prussian ambassador , he was surrounded by several persons in masks , one of whom fired a pistol at the back of the King , and lodged the contents in his body . A scene of dreadful confusion ensued . The conspirators , amidst the general tumult and alarm , had time to retire to other parts of the room ; but one of them had previously dropped his pistols and a dagger close by the wounded King . A general order was given to all the company to unmask , and the doors were immediately closed ; but no person appeared with any particular distinguishing marks of guilt . The King was immediately conveyed to his apartment ; and the surgeon , after extracting a ball and some slugs , gave favourable hopes of his Majesty 's recovery . "
806565	806633	806635	806635	his	1735	" The King languished from the 17th to the 29th of March . At first , the reports of his medical attendants were favourable ; but on the 28th a mortification was found to have taken place , which terminated his existence in a few hours . On opening his body , a square piece of lead and two rusty nails were found unextracted within the ribs . "
806835	806981	806801	806802	the regent	43841	" Ankarstrom was no sooner apprehended , than he confessed with an air of triumph , that he was the person ' who had endeavoured to liberate his country from a monster and a tyrant . ' Suspicions at the same time fell on the Counts Horn and Ribbing , Baron Pechlin , Baron Ehrensvard , Baron Hartsmandorf , Von Engerstrom the Royal Secretary , and others ; and these suspicions were confirmed by the confession of Ankarstrom . After a very fair and ample trial , this man was condemned to be publicly and severely whipped on three successive days , his right hand and his head to be cut off , and his body impaled : which sentence he suffered on the 17th of May. His property was given to his children , who , however , were compelled to change their name . "
806982	806991	806993	806993	Holford	1134	" Ankarstrom was a martyr — a hero ! "
807121	807129	807130	807130	he	1134	" Yes — Ankarstrom was a hero ! "
807133	807234	807130	807130	he	1134	" Oh ! how he must have despised the efforts of the torturers to wring from him a groan:—how he must have scorned the array of penalties which were sought to be made so terrible ! And Ravaillac — the regicide beneath whose hand fell Henry IV . of France — oh ! how well is every word of his history treasured up in my mind . But Francis Damien — ah ! his fate was terrible indeed ! And yet I am not afraid to contemplate it — even though such a one should be in store for me . "

807618	807628	807611	807611	they	21755	" exclaimed Holford , pushing the book from him : "
808027	808754	808017	808017	I	0	" And , as he spoke , he clenched his fists and ground his teeth together with a ferocious bitterness , which indicated the fearfully morbid condition of his mind . For he was enraged against fortune who had made him poor and humble — against the world for keeping him so — and against royalty and aristocracy for being so much happier and so incomparably more blessed than the section of society to which he belonged . And in his vanity — for his soaring disposition made him vain — he conceived that he possessed elements of greatness , which the world , with a wilful blindness , would not see ; or which adverse circumstances would not suffer to develop themselves . He deemed himself more persecuted than others moving in the same sphere : his restless , diseased , and excited mind , had conjured up a thousand evils to which he thought himself the marked — the special prey . He had seen , in his visits to the palace , so much of the highest eminence of luxury , pleasure , happiness , and indolent enjoyment , that he looked around with horror and affright when he found himself hurled back again into the lowest depths of obscurity , privation , and cheerlessness of life . He had at intervals feasted his eyes so greedily with all the fascination , the glitter , the gorgeousness , the splendour , the ease , and the voluptuousness , of the Court , that he could not endure the contemplation of the fearful contrast which was afforded by the every - day and familiar scenes of starvation , penury , misery , and ineffectual toil that marked the existence of the people . The moral condition of Henry Holford was a striking proof of the daring flights of which the human mind is capable . On the very first occasion of his visit to the palace , he had allowed himself to be carried away by all the wildest emotions and the strangest impressions that were produced by the novelty of what he then saw and heard . Royalty had been ever associated , in his vulgar conception , with something grand and handsome in man , and something wonderfully beautiful in woman . Thus , when he first saw the Queen , he was prepared to admire her:—he admired her accordingly ; and that feeling increased to a degree the insolence of which at times overawed and terrified even himself . By another wayward inclination of his unhealthy but enthusiastic mind , he had from the first been prepared to dislike the Prince ; and this feeling increased in violence with those circumstances which each successive visit to the royal abode developed . At length — as if his evil destiny must infallibly hurry him on to some appalling catastrophe — he was discovered by the Prince in the detestable condition of an eaves - dropper , and was ignominiously driven forth from that dwelling where his mind had gradually collected the elements of a most unnatural excitement . He knew that any attempt to repeat his visits would be frustrated by the precautions which were certain to have been adopted to prevent future intrusions of a like nature ; and he now felt precisely as one who is compelled suddenly to abandon a habit to which he had become wedded . Strange as it may appear , the morbid excitement attendant upon those visits to the palace was as necessary to Holford 's mental happiness as tobacco , opium , snuff , or strong liquors are to so many millions of individuals . With a person in such a state of mind , the first impulse was bitter hatred against the one who had deprived him of a source of pleasurable excitement ; and in that vengeful feeling were absorbed all those rational reflections which would have convinced him that his own insolent intrusion — his own unpardonable conduct — had provoked the treatment he had received . He never paused to ask himself by what right he had entered the palace and played the ignoble part of a listener to private conversation and a spy upon the hallowed sanctity of domestic life:—the dominant idea in his mind was his ignominious expulsion . "
808767	808774	808017	808017	I	0	" he would say to himself ; "
808801	808991	808788	808788	him	21778	" By degrees the mind of that young man found its gloomy broodings upon vengeance associating themselves with other sentiments . He gradually blended this idea of revenge with the ardent desire of breaking those trammels which kept his name imprisoned in the silent cavern of obscurity . The two sentiments at length united in his imagination ; and his pulse beat quickly — and his eyes flashed fire , when he surveyed the possibility of gratifying his thirst for vengeance and suddenly rendering his name notorious at the same moment , and by one desperate — fearful deed ! The reader can not now be at a loss to comprehend how this wretchedly mistaken young man was brought to study the history of those regicides who have gained an infamous renown in the annals of nations . And as he dwelt with an insane enthusiasm upon those narratives , the feeling of admiration — nay , adoration — which he had once experienced towards the Queen , was merged in the terrible longing for a diabolical notoriety that now became his predominating — his all - absorbing passion ! "
808994	809020	808788	808788	him	21778	" he exclaimed , as he pushed the book away from him , that night on which we have introduced the reader to his garret : "
809128	809851	809121	809126	the pot - boy Henry Holford	1134	" The act on which the young man was now resolved , appeared not to him in its real light as an atrocious crime — a damnable deed that would arouse a yell of execration from one end of the land to the other:—it seemed , on the contrary , a glorious achievement of which he would have reason to be proud . Alas ! how strangely constituted is the human mind , which , in any state of being , could cherish such monstrous delusions — such fatal aspirations ! But is there no blame to be attached to society for this development of ideas so morbid even on the part of one single individual ? is there nothing in the constitution of that society which gives encouragement , as it were , to those detestable sentiments ? Let us see . Enough has been said in the more serious and reasoning parts of this work to prove that society is in a vitiated — a false — and an artificial condition . The poor are too poor , and the rich too rich : the obscure are too low , and the exalted too high . The upper classes alone have opportunities of signalising themselves : the industrious millions have no chance of rising in the State . Interest procures rank in the Navy — money buys promotion in the Army — and interest and money united obtain seats in the Legislative Assembly . Interest and money , then , remain to the exclusive few : the millions have neither — nor are they even stimulated by a national system of Education . An aristocrat of common abilities may rise to eminence in some department of the State , with but little trouble : but a son of toil , however vast his natural talents , has not a single chance of starting from obscurity through the medium of their proper development . This is true : and we defy the most subtle reasoner on behalf of the oligarchy to refute those positions . Now , such being the case,—with a dominant aristocracy on one hand , and the oppressed millions on the other,—is it not evident that every now and then some member of the latter class will brood upon the vast , the astounding contrast until feelings of a deplorably morbid nature become excited in his mind ? How could it be otherwise ? Ireland , with its agrarian outrages and its frequent instances of assassination , proves the fact . England , with its incendiary fires in periods of deep distress , affords additional corroboration . We deplore that such should be the case ; and not for a moment do we advocate such means of vindicating just rights against the usurpers thereof . But if these instances of outbreaking revenge — if these ebullitions of indomitable resentment do now and then occur , no small portion of the blame must be charged against that aristocracy which maintains itself on an eminence so immeasurably above the depths in which the masses are compelled to languish . And when the poor creature who is goaded to desperation , does strike — can we wonder if , in the madness of his rage , he deals his blows indiscriminately , or against an innocent person ? He may even aim at royalty itself — although , in every really constitutional country , the sovereign is little more than a mere puppet , the Prime Minister of the day being the virtual ruler of the nation . From what we have said , it is easy to perceive how the contemplation of the splendid luxury of the palace first unhinged and unsettled the mind of Henry Holford . We must now go a step farther . Society manifests a most inordinate and pernicious curiosity in respect to criminals who perpetrate an unusual offence . This curiosity passes all legitimate bounds . The newspapers , with a natural attention to pecuniary interests , obey the cravings of that feeling by serving up the most highly - seasoned food to suit the peculiar appetite . Portraits of the guilty one are exhibited in every picture - shop . Apposite allusions are introduced into dramatic representations ; and even the presiding genius of a "
809856	809910	809121	809126	the pot - boy Henry Holford	1134	" mingles the subject with his humorous outpourings . If the criminal make an attack upon royalty , he goes through the important but mysterious ordeal of an examination at the Home Office , whence the reporters for the press are excluded . On his appearance at Bow Street , the magisterial tribunal is "
809926	810051	809915	809915	ladies	29329	" as the journals say ; and when the finale comes at the Central Criminal Court , the fees for admission to the gallery rise to two or three guineas for each individual . Thus the criminal is made into a hero ! Now is not all this sufficient to turn the head of one whose mind is already partially unhinged ? Society , then , is to blame in many ways for the development of those morbid feelings which , in the present instance , actuated Henry Holford in his desperate purpose . Crankey Jem was at dinner , in the afternoon of the day which followed the night of Holford 's sad historical studies , when the young man entered his room . "
810062	810083	810055	810055	you	21784	" said Jem , pointing to a seat , and pushing a plate across the table in the same direction . "

810787	810792	810746	810746	he	1061	" observed Crankey Jem ; "
810979	810980	810981	810981	I	0	" "
810986	810993	810981	810981	I	0	" exclaimed Henry Holford , abruptly , "
811007	811008	810996	810996	you	873	" "
811020	811039	811012	811012	you	873	" demanded the returned convict , laying down his knife , and looking Holford full in the face . "
811059	811084	811049	811050	another man	13755	" said Henry , returning the glance in a manner so confident and unabashed , that Jem 's suspicions were hushed in a moment . "
811096	811100	811087	811087	you	873	" said he : "
811110	811128	811103	811103	you	873	" With these words , he rose , went to a cupboard , and produced the weapons . "
811144	811148	811129	811129	I	0	" said Holford . "
811153	811154	811129	811129	I	0	" "
811157	811161	811129	811129	I	0	" answered Jem . "
811177	811178	811179	811179	I	0	" "
811188	811192	811193	811193	I	0	" observed Holford . "
811204	811205	811199	811200	my friend	26696	" "
811223	811232	811233	811234	Many persons	8123	" ejaculated Jem , his vague suspicions returning . "
811253	811263	811266	811266	they	8123	" said the young man , still completely unabashed ; "
811278	811279	811266	811266	they	8123	" "
811287	811415	811266	811266	they	8123	" muttered Jem . Still he was not quite reassured ; and yet he was unwilling to tax Holford with requiring the pistols for any improper purpose . The young lad 's reasons might be true — they were at least feasible ; and Jem was loth to hurt his feelings by hinting at any suspicion which the demand for the weapons had occasioned . Moreover , it would be churlish to refuse the loan of them — and almost equally so to decline loading them;—and the returned convict possessed an obliging disposition , although he had been so much knocked about in the world . He was also attached to Henry Holford , and would go far to serve him . Nevertheless , he still hesitated . "
811428	811437	811426	811426	Jem	873	" said Holford , observing that he wavered . "
811445	811457	811426	811426	Jem	873	" demanded the man , turning short round upon the lad . "
811464	811472	811460	811460	you	21820	" cried Holford , now blushing deeply . "
811505	811506	811460	811460	you	21820	" "
811511	811515	811460	811460	you	21820	" said Jem ; "
811532	811533	811517	811517	you	0	" "
811538	811544	811545	811545	you	21820	" cried Holford , laughing : "
811574	811575	811570	811570	I	0	" "
811586	811648	811578	811578	you	0	" said Crankey Jem ; and , turning to the cupboard , he proceeded to load the pistols . But still he was not altogether satisfied ! Holford rose from his seat with an assumed air of indifference , and approached the table where the little models of the ships were standing . A few minutes thus elapsed in profound silence . "
811655	811662	811649	811649	They	21823	" said Jem , at length ; "
811701	811702	811703	811703	I	0	" "
811707	811720	811703	811703	I	0	" returned Holford , as he concealed the pistols about his person . "
811733	811734	811721	811721	I	0	" "
811738	811827	811721	811721	I	0	" said Jem . But scarcely had Holford left the room a minute , when the returned convict followed him . The fact was that there shot forth a gleam of such inexpressible satisfaction from Holford 's eyes , at the moment when he grasped the pistols , that the vague suspicions which had already been floating in the mind of Crankey Jem seemed suddenly to receive confirmation — or at least to be materially strengthened ; and he feared lest his young friend meditated self - destruction . "
811837	811856	811721	811721	I	0	" muttered Jem , as he hastened down the stairs , slouching his large hat over his eyes ; "
811881	811918	811872	811872	I	0	" When he gained the street , he looked hastily up and down , and caught a glimpse of Holford , who was just turning into Russell Street , leading from Drury Lane towards Covent Garden . "
811927	811932	811919	811919	I	0	" thought Crankey Jem . "
811959	812064	811954	811954	I	0	" Meantime , Holford , little suspecting that his friend was at no great distance behind him , pursued his way towards St. James 's Park . Now that his mind was bent upon a particular object , and that all considerations had resolved themselves into that fixed determination , his countenance , though very pale , was singularly calm and tranquil ; and neither by his face nor his manner did he attract any particular notice as he wandered slowly along . He gained the Park , and proceeded up the Mall towards Constitution Hill . Crankey Jem followed him at a distance . "
812082	812088	812077	812078	some friends	27007	" he muttered to himself ; "
812102	812243	812244	812244	They	27007	" Holford stopped midway in the wide road intersecting Constitution Hill , and lounged in an apparently indifferent manner against the fence skirting the Green Park . There were but few persons about , in that particular direction , at the time,—although the afternoon was very fine , and the sun was shining brightly through the fresh , frosty air . It was now three o'clock ; and some little bustle was visible amongst those few loungers who were at the commencement of the road , and who were enabled to command a view of the front of the palace . They ranged themselves on one side:—there was a trampling of horses ; and in a few moments a low open phaeton , drawn by four bays , turned rapidly from the park into the road leading over Constitution Hill . "
812248	812381	812244	812244	They	27007	" murmured Holford to himself , as he observed the equipage from the short distance where he was standing . Every hat was raised by the little group at the end of the road , as the vehicle dashed by — for in it were seated the Queen and her illustrious husband . By a strange coincidence Her Majesty was sitting on the left hand of Prince Albert , and not on the right as usual : she was consequently nearest to the wall of the palace - gardens , while the Prince was nearest to the railings of the Green Park . And now the moment so anxiously desired by Holford , was at hand:—the phaeton drew nigh . He hesitated:—yes — he hesitated;—but it was only for a single second . "
812399	812473	812244	812244	They	27007	" were the thoughts that , rapid as lightning , flashed across his mind . Not another moment did he waver ; but , advancing from the railings against which he had been lounging , he drew a pistol from his breast and fired it point - blank at the royal couple as the phaeton dashed past . The Queen screamed and rose from her seat ; and the postillions stopped their horses . "
812477	812551	812552	812553	My God	27430	" cried the Prince , in a loud tone , as he pulled Her Majesty back upon the seat ; and his countenance was ashy pale . Holford threw the first pistol hastily away from him , and drew forth the second . But at that moment a powerful grasp seized him from behind,—his arm was knocked upwards,—the pistol went off into the air,—and a well - known voice cried in his ears , "
812562	812581	812555	812555	Harry	1134	" Several other persons had by this time collected on the spot ; and the most cordial shouts of "
812587	812588	812589	812589	God	880	" "
812594	812654	812589	812589	God	880	" burst from their lips . Her Majesty bowed in a most graceful and grateful manner : the Prince raised his hat in acknowledgment of the sympathy and attachment manifested towards his royal spouse and himself;—and the phaeton rolled rapidly away towards Hyde Park , in obedience to the wishes of the Queen and the orders of the Prince . "
812665	812694	812660	812660	I	0	" repeated Crankey Jem , without relaxing his hold upon the would - be regicide . But Holford hung down his head , and maintained a moody silence . "
812700	812701	812696	812696	you	0	" "
812706	812742	812704	812704	he	21832	" were the questions that were now addressed to Crankey Jem from all sides . But before he could answer his interrogators , two policemen broke through the crowd , and took Holford into custody . "
812752	812768	812771	812772	Mr. Crisp	939	" said one of the officers , who was a serjeant , to his companion . "
812774	812779	812771	812772	Mr. Crisp	939	" was the reply . "
812787	812798	812771	812772	Mr. Crisp	939	" continued the serjeant , addressing himself to Crankey Jem , "
812819	812820	812807	812807	you	939	" "
812826	812838	812839	812839	I	0	" said Jem , now terribly alarmed on his own account : "
812842	812843	812839	812839	I	0	" "
812848	812853	812839	812839	I	0	" cried Mr. Crisp . "
812883	812907	812880	812880	I	0	" added Mr. Crisp , changing his tone and assuming a severe look as he gazed on the countenance of the returned convict , "
812915	812916	812919	812920	Mr. Crisp	939	" "
812922	812933	812919	812920	Mr. Crisp	939	" said the policeman , who had charge of Holford . "
812944	812949	812919	812920	Mr. Crisp	939	" cried the serjeant , "
812972	813265	812965	812965	he	21839	" With these words Mr. Crisp collared the poor fellow , who offered no resistance . But large tears rolled down his cheeks ! Policemen and prisoners then proceeded across the park to the Home Office , followed by a crowd that rapidly increased in numbers as it rolled onwards . On the arrival of the two prisoners and the two policemen at the Home Office , they were shown into a small room joining the one in which the Secretary of State for that Department was accustomed to receive individuals or deputations , and where we have already seen him in an earlier portion of this work . But on the present occasion the Home Secretary had to be fetched from the Foreign Office , where he was sitting with his colleagues in a Cabinet Council . The police officers and the prisoners were therefore left alone together for nearly half an hour in the room to which some subordinate official had ordered them to be conducted , upon the motives of their presence there being made known to him . The crime of which Holford was accused seemed too grave and serious for even the tamperings of policemen : still as these gentry are not merely content with having a finger in almost every pie , but must thrust a whole hand in when once they find the opportunity , it was impossible that either Mr. Crisp or his colleague could leave Crankey Jem as well as the would - be regicide unassailed with questions . The common policeman placed a chair against the outer door of the room , and seated himself in it with the air of a man who meant to say as plainly as he could , "
813272	813401	813269	813269	you	21841	" Holford sank upon a seat and fell into a profound reverie ; but it was impossible to gather the nature of his thoughts from the now passionless and almost apathetic expression of his countenance . Crankey Jem also took a chair ; but his nervous manner , the pallor of his face , the quivering of his lip , and the unsettled glances of his eyes , betrayed the fearful condition of his mind . The poor wretch already imagined himself transported back amongst the horrors of Norfolk Island ! As for Mr. Crisp , he walked once or twice up and down the room , surveying himself complacently in a mirror , and then advancing towards Crankey Jem , said with a sort of official importance , "
813419	813431	813416	813416	you	16943	" Jem Cuffin cast upon him a look of deep disgust . "
813434	813450	813452	813452	you	16943	" continued Mr. Crisp , in no way abashed at this unequivocal expression of feeling , "
813530	813531	813532	813532	I	0	" "
813540	813545	813532	813532	I	0	" observed Crankey Jem . "
813558	813563	813552	813552	I	0	" said Mr. Crisp . "
813610	813611	813608	813608	yourself	16943	" "
813643	813647	813636	813636	you	0	" said Jem . "
813662	813667	813657	813657	I	0	" returned Mr. Crisp . "
813687	813688	813676	813676	I	0	" "
813697	813698	813693	813693	I	0	" "
813706	813710	813701	813701	I	0	" cried Crisp . "
813717	813724	813711	813711	I	0	" observed Jem Cuffin , angrily . "
813754	813759	813750	813750	your	16943	" continued Mr. Crisp , "
813791	813792	813781	813781	I	0	" "
813800	813806	813793	813793	I	0	" returned Jem , drily . "
813819	813823	813824	813824	I	0	" cried Crisp . "
813840	813841	813793	813793	I	0	" "
813848	813859	813793	813793	I	0	" said Crankey Jem , with a movement of impatience . "
813896	813897	813883	813883	I	0	" "
813903	813908	813898	813898	You	16943	" returned Crankey Jem . "
813914	813922	813898	813898	You	16943	" exclaimed Crisp , rubbing his nose . "
813970	813971	813951	813951	I	0	" "
813974	813978	813951	813951	I	0	" cried Jem ; "
813985	813986	813951	813951	I	0	" "
813994	814025	813951	813951	I	0	" proceeded the indefatigable Mr. Crisp : then , perceiving that his endeavours to find out the prisoner 's place of abode were useless , he went upon another tack . "
814082	814096	814097	814097	I	0	" And Mr. Crisp fixed a searching eye upon Crankey Jem 's countenance . "
814104	814114	814115	814115	you	16943	" exclaimed the prisoner , seriously irritated at length ; "
814164	814278	814279	814279	You	21856	" With these words , Crankey Jem turned his back upon the baffled Mr. Crisp , and looked out of the window . Almost at the same moment an inner door was thrown open , and one of the Under Secretaries for the Home Department beckoned Mr. Crisp into the adjacent room , where the principal Secretary was already seated , he having arrived by the private entrance . Crisp remained with the Minister for about ten minutes , and then returned to the ante - room , but it was merely to conduct Henry Holford and Crankey Jem into the presence of the Home Secretary and the Chief Magistrate of Bow Street . "
814285	814297	814298	814298	Crisp	939	" said the Home Secretary , addressing the police - officer . "
814308	814309	814303	814303	Crisp	939	" "
814325	814398	814318	814318	You	21856	" repeated the Minister . And the police - officer retired accordingly , marvelling how the examination could possibly be conducted in a proper manner without his important presence . The magistrate commenced by informing Henry Holford of the accusation laid against him by Crisp , and then cautioned him in the usual manner to beware of what he said , as anything he uttered might be used in evidence against him . "
814415	814419	814420	814420	I	0	" returned Holford . "
814441	814442	814446	814446	you	21856	" "
814450	814454	814446	814446	you	21856	" exclaimed Jem ; "
814474	814486	814463	814463	I	0	" Holford cast a glance of unfeigned surprise on his friend . "
814489	814494	814463	814463	I	0	" continued the latter , "
814622	814623	814607	814607	you	21856	" "
814628	814637	814607	814607	you	21856	" said the magistrate to the Home Secretary . "
814641	814689	814607	814607	you	21856	" answered the latter functionary , who , from the first moment that Holford entered the room , had never ceased to gaze at him in the same way that one would contemplate an animal with two heads , or four tails , in the Zoological Gardens . "
814704	814726	814727	814727	He	2092	" remarked the magistrate , in an under tone . The words did not , however , escape Holford 's ears . "
814733	814746	814751	814751	he	2092	" cried the youth , as if indignant at the bare idea . "
814805	814860	814861	814862	This man	27445	" Crisp and the other policeman were called in separately , and examined upon this point . Their evidence went entirely to prove that James Cuffin could not have been an accomplice in the deed . When the policemen had withdrawn , the Home Secretary and the magistrate conversed together in a low tone . "
814874	814879	814871	814871	my	0	" said the magistrate ; "
814914	814915	814916	814916	You	27330	" "
814924	814930	814916	814916	You	27330	" returned the Home Secretary ; "
814948	814949	814936	814936	I	0	" "
814962	815757	814959	814960	my lord	27330	" said the magistrate , inquiringly . The Minister nodded an assent . The policemen were re - admitted , the depositions were signed , and the necessary instructions were given for the removal of the prisoners . Two cabs were procured : Holford was conducted to one , and conveyed to Newgate,—but not before he had shaken hands with Crankey Jem , who shed tears when he took so sad a farewell of the lad , whom he really liked . He himself was shortly afterwards removed in the other cab to the New Prison , Clerkenwell . A week had now elapsed since Lydia Hutchinson entered the service of Lady Ravensworth . The service ! Oh ! what a service was that where the menial had become the mistress , and the mistress had descended to the menial . From the moment that Lydia had expressed her unalterable resolution to remain at the Hall , Lord Ravensworth scarcely ever quitted his private cabinet . He had a bed made up in an adjoining room , and secluded himself completely from his wife . Vainly did Adeline seek him — go upon her knees before him — and beseech him , with the bitterest tears and the most fervent prayers , to return to an active life:—he contemplated her with an apathetic listlessness — as if he were verging , when but little past the prime of life , into second childhood . Or if he did manifest a scintillation of his former spirit , it was merely to command his wife to leave him to his own meditations . And again did he have recourse to the pipe : in fact he was never easy now save when he lulled his thoughts into complete stupefaction by means of the oriental tobacco . Even when , in the midst of her earnest prayers , his wife implored him to come forth again into the world — to live , in fine , for the sake of his as yet unborn babe , the fire that kindled in his eyes was so evanescent that an acute observer could alone perceive the momentary — and only momentary — effect which the appeal produced . The guests had all taken their departure the day after the bridal ; and the splendid mansion immediately became the scene of silence and of woe . To all the entreaties of his wife — to all the representations of his favourite page Quentin , that he would engage eminent medical assistance , Lord Ravensworth turned a deaf ear , or else so far roused himself as to utter a stern refusal , accompanied with a command that he might be left alone . Thus was he rapidly accomplishing his own destruction,—committing involuntary suicide by slow , certain , and yet unsuspected means,—even as his brother , the Honourable Gilbert Vernon , had declared to the Resurrection Man . Adeline had no inclination to seek the bustle and excitement of society . Her love of display and ostentation was subdued — if not altogether crushed . She was so overwhelmed with sorrow — so goaded by the tyranny of Lydia Hutchinson — so desperate by the mere fact of having to submit to that oppression , and by the consciousness that she dared not unbosom her cares to a single sympathising heart,—that she at times felt as if she were on the point of becoming raving mad , and at others as if she could lay herself down and die ! We will afford the reader an idea of the mode of life which the once proud and haughty Lady Ravensworth was now compelled to lead beneath the crushing despotism of Lydia Hutchinson . It was on the seventh morning after the arrival of the latter at Ravensworth Hall . The clock had struck nine , when Lydia repaired to the apartment of her mistress —— her mistress ! Until she reached the door , her manner was meek and subdued , because she incurred a chance of meeting other domestics in the passages and corridors . But the moment she entered Adeline 's apartment — the moment the door of that chamber closed behind her — her manner suddenly changed . No longer meek — no longer subdued — no longer wearing the stamp of servitude Lydia assumed a stern expression of countenance — so terrible in a vengeful woman — and in an instant clothed herself , as it were , with an appearance of truly fiend - like malignity . Adeline slept . Approaching the bed , Lydia shook her rudely . Lady Ravensworth awoke with a start , and then glanced hastily — almost franticly — around . "
815764	815781	815760	815760	you	21872	" she murmured , shrinking from the look of bitter hatred which Lydia cast upon her . "
815789	815795	815784	815784	I	0	" said the vindictive woman . "
815804	815805	815800	815800	you	21872	" "
815813	815817	815800	815800	you	21872	" exclaimed Adeline ; "
815906	815907	815914	815914	I	0	" "
815917	815921	815914	815914	I	0	" cried Lydia . "
816093	816131	816136	816136	Adeline	1545	" With these words Lydia seized Lady Ravensworth rudely by the wrist , and compelled her to leave the couch . Then the revengeful woman seated herself in a chair , and said in a harsh tone , "
816142	816143	816138	816138	I	0	" "
816155	816160	816161	816161	You	0	" exclaimed Lady Ravensworth . "
816176	816177	816161	816161	You	0	" "
816184	816191	816179	816179	me	0	" said Lydia Hutchinson , coolly ; "
816229	816230	816233	816234	my God	27430	" "
816242	816250	816233	816234	my God	27430	" murmured Adeline , wringing her hands . "
816262	816263	816233	816234	my God	27430	" "
816283	816287	816266	816267	a woman	3385	" returned Lydia . "
816301	816426	816427	816427	I	0	" Adeline made no reply ; but , with scalding tears trickling down her cheeks , she proceeded — yes , she — the high - born peeress!—to arrange the wood in the grate — to heap up the coals — and to light the fire . And while she was kneeling in the performance of that menial task,—while her delicate white hands were coming in contact with the black grate,—and while she was shivering in her night gear , and her long dishevelled hair streamed over her naked neck and bosom,—there , within a few feet of her , sate the menial — the servant , comfortably placed in an arm - chair , and calmly surveying the degrading occupation of her mistress . "
816470	816479	816492	816493	the rich	1894	" said Lydia , after a short pause ; "
816574	816716	816725	816725	madam	26758	" Adeline sobbed bitterly , but made no reply . The fire was now blazing in the grate : still the high - born peeress was shivering with the cold — for ere she could put on a single article of clothing , she was forced to wash the black dirt from her delicate fingers . Then that lady , who — until within a week — had never even done so much as take , with her own hands , a change of linen from the cupboard or select a gown from the wardrobe , was compelled to perform those duties for herself;—and all the while her servant,—her hired servant , to whom she had to pay high wages and afford food and lodging,—that servant was seated in the arm - chair , warming herself by the now cheerful fire ! "
816727	816731	816725	816725	madam	26758	" said Lydia . "
817004	817114	817117	817117	you	1545	" While Lydia Hutchinson was thus venting her bitter sarcasm and her cutting reproach upon Lady Ravensworth , the latter was hurriedly accomplishing the routine of the toilet . She no longer took pride in her appearance:—she scarcely glanced in the mirror as she combed out those tresses which it was Lydia 's duty to have arranged;—her sole thought was to escape as speedily as possible from that room where insults and indignities were so profusely accumulated upon her . But her ordeal of torture was not yet at its end . So soon as Lady Ravensworth was dressed , Lydia Hutchinson said in a cool but authoritative tone , "
817127	817128	817117	817117	you	1545	" "
817145	817152	817154	817154	I	0	" almost shrieked the unhappy lady ; "
817184	817185	817186	817186	I	0	" "
817202	817218	817186	817186	I	0	" said Lydia , in the same imperturbable manner in which she had before spoken . "
817286	817287	817275	817275	you	1545	" "
817296	817306	817307	817307	I	0	" cried Adeline , fire flashing from her eyes . "
817328	817332	817334	817334	your	0	" replied Lydia ; "
817342	817343	817334	817335	your ladyship	6346	" "
817364	817370	817371	817371	You	0	" ejaculated Adeline , wildly . "
817389	817390	817379	817379	you	0	" "
817399	817403	817392	817392	you	0	" interrupted Lydia ; "
817464	817465	817466	817466	Lydia	1544	" "
817488	817519	817481	817481	you	1544	" cried Adeline , clasping her hands together in a paroxysm of ineffable anguish , and falling at the feet of the stern and relentless woman whom she had wronged . "
817528	817553	817481	817481	you	1544	" said Lydia Hutchinson , now speaking in a deep and almost hoarse tone , which denoted the powerful concentration of her vengeful passions . "
817668	817669	817679	817679	Lydia	1544	" "
817681	817709	817679	817679	Lydia	1544	" cried Adeline , in a voice of despair , while she endeavoured to take the hands of her servant , at whose feet she still knelt . "
817721	817734	817679	817679	Lydia	1544	" said Lydia , drawing back her hands in a contemptuous manner : "
817744	817745	817679	817679	Lydia	1544	" "
817764	817780	817781	817781	I	0	" exclaimed Adeline , raising her eyes in an imploring manner towards the vengeful woman . "
817815	817816	817817	817817	Your	1544	" "
817827	817839	817817	817817	Your	1544	" said Lydia , with a scornful curl of the lip ; "
817885	817886	817868	817868	you	1544	" "
817900	817917	817868	817868	you	1544	" ejaculated Adeline , rising from her knees in a perfect fury of rage and despair , "
817958	818176	818178	818178	you	21920	" she repeated , her eyes rolling wildly , and her delicate hands clenching as she screamed forth the word . The scene was really an awful one — a scene to which no powers of description can possibly do justice . The stern , inflexible tyranny of Lydia Hutchinson forced Lady Ravensworth to pass through all the terrible ordeal of the most tearing and heart - breaking emotions . Did the miserable peeress endeavour to screen herself within the stronghold of a sullen silence , the words of Lydia Hutchinson would gradually fall upon her , one after the other , with an irritating power that at length goaded her to desperation . Did she meet accusation by retort , and encounter reproach with upbraiding , the inveteracy of Lydia 's torturing language wound her feelings up to such a pitch that it was no wonder she should ask , with an agonising scream , whether the avenging woman sought to drive her mad ? Or , again , did she endeavour to move the heart of her hired servant by self - humiliation and passionate appeal , the coldness , or the malignant triumph with which those manifestations were received awoke within her that proud and haughty spirit which was now so nearly subdued altogether . "
818185	818250	818178	818178	you	21920	" Lady Ravensworth had said:—then , when the accompanying paroxysm of feeling was past , she threw herself on a chair , and burst into an agony of tears . But Lydia was not softened ! She suffered Adeline to weep for a few minutes ; and when the unhappy lady was exhausted — subdued — spirit - broken — the unrelenting torturess repeated her command—"You
818257	818302	818178	818178	you	21920	" Oh ! bad as Adeline was at heart — selfish as she was by nature and by education,—it would have moved a savage to have seen the imploring , beseeching look which , through her tears , she cast upon Lydia 's countenance . "
818306	818332	818178	818178	you	21920	" said Lydia , imperatively . Then Lady Ravensworth rose , and meekly and timidly began to perform that menial office for her own menial . "
818337	818341	818333	818333	I	0	" observed Lydia , "
818583	818804	818805	818805	His	21931	" In this strain did Lydia Hutchinson continue to speak , while Lady Ravensworth arranged her hair . And each word that the vindictive woman uttered , fell like a drop of molten lead upon the already lacerated heart of the unfortunate Adeline . At length the ordeal — that same ordeal which had characterised each morning since Lydia Hutchinson had become an inmate of Ravensworth Hall — was over ; and Adeline was released from that horrible tyranny — but only for a short time . When Lady Ravensworth descended to the breakfast parlour , she summoned her husband 's principal valet , Quentin , to her presence , and desired him to hasten and inform his lordship that the morning meal was served up . Quentin bowed and retired . But both Lady Ravensworth and the valet were well aware that this was a mere idle ceremonial which would only lead to the same ineffectual result as on the six preceding mornings — indeed , ever since the arrival of Lydia Hutchinson at the Hall . At the same time , the servant was very far from suspecting how large a share the new lady's - maid enjoyed in the relapse of his master and the increasing sorrows of his mistress . In a few minutes Quentin returned . "
818818	818838	818808	818808	you	21933	" was the message which he delivered — a message as formal as the one that had evoked it . "
818846	818855	818856	818857	His lordship	3013	" asked Adeline , with a profound sigh . "
818868	819021	818856	818857	His lordship	3013	" was the answer . Adeline sighed once more , and remained silent . The valet withdrew ; and the unhappy lady endeavoured to eat a morsel of food : but she had no appetite — her stomach seemed to loathe all solid nourishment ; and she pushed her plate from her . She then endeavoured to while away an hour or two with the most recently published novel and the morning 's newspapers ; but she found her imagination ever wandering to other and sadly painful topics . It was about mid - day , when , as she was standing listlessly at the window , which commanded a view of the park , she suddenly caught sight of a carriage that was advancing rapidly towards the mansion . The livery of the servants belonging to it was unknown to her ; and she hastily summoned a domestic to instruct him that "
819031	819112	819022	819022	she	21938	" The vehicle drove up to the principal entrance of Ravensworth Hall ; and although the domestic delivered the answer commanded by his mistress , it did not seem sufficient to cause the departure of the carriage . There was some conversation between the servant who gave that answer and the occupants of the vehicle;—but Lady Ravensworth could not overhear a word that was said . In a few minutes , however , the domestic returned to Adeline 's presence . "
819117	819121	819114	819115	your ladyship	6346	" he said , "
819144	819145	819138	819139	his companions	26945	" "
819150	819155	819148	819148	you	0	" interrupted Lady Ravensworth . "
819170	819313	819314	819314	You	21945	" The domestic once more hurried away ; and Adeline shortly beheld , from the window , two gentlemen alight from the carriage , and then carefully remove a third , who appeared to be in a helpless condition . She did not , however , catch a glimpse of either of their faces . Lady Ravensworth now felt herself to be in a most unpleasant situation . Her husband , she knew , would not come forth from his private cabinet to do the honours of his mansion ; and delicacy prevented her from hastening to receive persons who might be total strangers to her , and who arrived under such extraordinary circumstances . She did not , however , long hesitate how to act . Ringing the bell , and summoning Quentin to her presence , she said to him , "
819377	819466	819467	819467	I	0	" Quentin retired to execute this commission . He had the wounded man borne to a bed - room , and offered to send a messenger on horseback to procure medical assistance , from the nearest village ; but one of the other two gentlemen proved to be a surgeon , whose services had been engaged in the usual manner by the duellists . In the meantime , Lady Ravensworth repaired to her boudoir , to change her dress . She was immediately followed thither by Lydia Hutchinson . "
819474	819494	819495	819495	I	0	" said Adeline , with a visible shudder , as the lady's - maid closed the door behind her . "
819504	819508	819495	819495	I	0	" returned Lydia . "
819552	819553	819538	819538	I	0	" "
819567	819585	819558	819558	you	0	" cried Lady Ravensworth , affrighted by the malignant bitterness with which these last words were uttered . "
819599	819603	819587	819587	you	0	" demanded Lydia . "
819612	819616	819587	819587	you	0	" replied Adeline . "
819638	819639	819641	819643	that wounded duellist	21956	" "
819655	819661	819647	819648	his companions	26945	" said Lydia , impressively . "
819666	819690	819647	819648	his companions	26945	" ejaculated Adeline , who felt convinced that some fresh cause of anguish to herself lurked in the mysterious language of her torturess . "
819705	819716	819647	819648	his companions	26945	" said Lydia , as if shuddering with concentrated rage . "
819733	819745	819647	819648	his companions	26945	" exclaimed Adeline , a terrible suspicion darting across her mind . "
819753	819767	819750	819750	your	0	" said Lydia , fixing her eyes with malignant joy upon her mistress : "
819790	819791	819793	819793	God	880	" "
819799	819819	819829	819829	he	21961	" murmured Adeline , in a low but solemn tone . And she sank almost insensible upon the sofa . "
819822	819828	819829	819829	he	21961	" continued the unrelenting Lydia , "
819966	819967	819958	819960	These two men	21971	" "
819987	819998	819999	819999	Your	0	" murmured Adeline , in the bitterness of her heart . "
820008	820027	819999	819999	Your	0	" retorted Lydia , ever ready to plunge a fresh dagger into the soul of the unhappy lady . "
820037	820046	820031	820031	you	0	" ejaculated Adeline , clasping her hands together . "
820074	820075	820065	820065	I	0	" "
820093	820097	820065	820065	I	0	" said Lydia . "
820113	820118	820104	820104	I	0	" she added sneeringly ; "
820130	820131	820120	820120	I	0	" "
820136	820148	820120	820120	I	0	" cried Lady Ravensworth , springing from the sofa in alarm . "
820159	820199	820151	820151	I	0	" observed Lydia , calmly . Adeline made no reply : she felt convinced that all remonstrance would be useless . She accordingly addressed herself to the toilet , Lydia assisting her in that ceremony for the first time . "
820222	820226	820211	820211	I	0	" said Lydia ; "
820252	820253	820287	820287	you	0	" "
820256	820278	820287	820287	you	0	" cried Adeline , turning sharply round upon Lydia , whose bitter taunt touched the most sensitive fibre of her heart . "
820293	820691	820287	820287	you	0	" said Lydia , with imperturbable coolness . Adeline bit her lips almost till the blood came , to suppress the rage that rose as it were into her throat . She then hastily left the boudoir , followed at a short distance by Lydia Hutchinson . Lady Ravensworth knew that her torturess was behind her,—knew also that it was vain to reason with her in respect to any particular line of conduct that she might choose to adopt . As the unhappy lady proceeded towards the drawing - room , she endeavoured to compose both her countenance and her mind as much as possible : but she felt herself blushing at one moment and turning pale the next,—now with a face that seemed to be on fire — then with an icy coldness at the heart . Since she was at school at Belvidere House she had never met Colonel Cholmondeley . He had been much abroad ; and , when he was in London , accident had so willed it that he did not once encounter the partner of his temporary amour . But that same chance was not for ever to be favourable to Adeline in this respect ; and now she was at length about to meet that man of all the species in whose presence she had most cause to blush . Such an encounter was however necessary , for the sake of appearances . What would her servants think if she remained in the solitude of her own chamber while visitors were at the mansion ? what would the surgeon , who attended the wounded duellist , conjecture if she refused the common courtesy which became the mistress of the mansion ? The total retirement of Lord Ravensworth was already a sufficient reason to provoke strange surmises on the part of the newly - arrived guests , although the existence of his extraordinary and unaccountable malady was well known in the fashionable world : but if to that fact were superadded the circumstance of a similar seclusion on the part of Lady Ravensworth , the most unpleasant rumours might arise . Thus was Adeline imperatively forced to do the honours of her house on this occasion . And now she has reached the door of the drawing - room . She pauses for a moment : how violently beats her heart ! "
820696	820702	820287	820287	you	0	" she murmurs to herself : "
820715	820786	820787	820788	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" And she entered the drawing - room . One only of the guests was there ; and he had his back towards the door at the moment . But full well did she recognise that tall , graceful , and well - knit frame . The sound of light footsteps upon the thick carpet caused him to turn hastily round;—and then Adeline and her seducer were face to face . "
820790	820811	820787	820788	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" said the Colonel , rather averting his glance as he spoke — for he experienced the full embarrassment of this encounter,—"necessity
820939	820940	820941	820941	I	0	" "
820962	820982	820941	820941	I	0	" said Adeline , with her eyes fixed upon the ground , and a deep blush upon her cheeks . "
820990	820991	820992	820993	Mr. Graham	1753	" "
821006	821011	820992	820993	Mr. Graham	1753	" answered the Colonel ; "
821068	821069	821059	821059	I	0	" "
821096	821160	821161	821161	I	0	" said Lydia Hutchinson , who had entered the room unperceived by either Colonel Cholmondeley or Lady Ravensworth , and who now advanced slowly towards them . The Colonel stared at Lydia for a few moments : but evidently not recognising her , he turned a rapid glance of inquiry upon Adeline , who only hung down her head , and remained silent . "
821172	821194	821164	821164	you	0	" continued Lydia , approaching close to Colonel Cholmondeley : then , fixing her eyes intently upon him , she said , "
821201	821202	821196	821196	you	0	" "
821208	821222	821203	821206	My good young woman	21995	" replied the Colonel , with a mixture of hauteur and bantering jocularity , "
821278	821279	821285	821288	every lady's - maid	21998	" "
821290	821311	821285	821288	every lady's - maid	21998	" said Lydia , with a scornful glance towards Adeline , who , pale and trembling , had sunk upon a seat,—"it
821335	821427	821285	821288	every lady's - maid	21998	" While she was yet speaking , a light broke upon the Colonel 's mind . Who but one acquainted with Lady Ravensworth 's secret could be capable of such extraordinary conduct ? This idea led him to survey Lydia Hutchinson 's countenance more attentively than before;—and , although it was much altered,—although it no longer bore the blooming freshness which had characterised it when he first knew her,—still the expression and the features enabled him to recognise the young woman who had become the victim of his friend Lord Dunstable . "
821435	821458	821430	821430	you	0	" continued Lydia , perceiving by a sudden gesture on the part of the Colonel that he had at length remembered her . "
821608	821817	821818	821818	I	0	" And pointing disdainfully at Adeline , who uttered a low scream and covered her face with her hands as those terrible words fell upon her ears , Lydia slowly quitted the room . Frightfully painful was now the situation of Lady Ravensworth and Colonel Cholmondeley . The former was crushed by the terrible indignity cast upon her : the latter was so astounded and at the same time so hurt by all that had just occurred , that he knew not how to act . He felt that any attempt to console Lady Ravensworth would be an insult ; and yet he experienced an equal inability to permit the scene to pass without some comment . Fortunately for them both , Mr. Graham , the surgeon , entered the room at this juncture . Adeline composed herself by one of those extraordinary efforts which she had lately been so often compelled to exert ; and Cholmondeley , with the case of a man of fashion ( who must necessarily be a thorough hypocrite ) , instantly assumed a manner that would even have disarmed suspicion , had any been excited . Having uttered a few ceremonial phrases upon his introduction to Lady Ravensworth , Mr. Graham said , "
821853	821854	821840	821840	I	0	" "
821858	821893	821840	821840	I	0	" exclaimed Cholmondeley,—not with any real piety , but merely using that common phrase as expressive of his joy to think that the matter was not more serious than it now appeared to be . "
821901	821910	821840	821840	I	0	" continued the surgeon , turning towards Adeline , "
821931	821932	821928	821929	your ladyship	6346	" "
821949	821953	821928	821929	your ladyship	6346	" observed Adeline . "
821994	822005	822007	822007	my	0	" The surgeon bowed in acknowledgment of this courteous intimation . "
822010	822017	822007	822007	my	0	" Colonel Cholmondeley hastened to say , "
822055	822360	822043	822043	I	0	" Adeline threw a glance of gratitude upon the Colonel for this expression of his intention to relieve her from the embarrassment of his presence ; and accordingly , after partaking of some luncheon , Cholmondeley took his departure . But ere he left , Lydia Hutchinson had secretly placed a letter , containing a key , upon the seat of the carriage which bore him away . It would be impossible to conceive the existence of a more wretched woman than Adeline Ravensworth . Though wealth and title were hers,—though every luxury and every pleasure were within her reach,—though with jewels of inestimable value she might deck herself at will , and thus enhance her natural charms,—still , still was she the prey to a constant agony of mind which rendered life intolerable . For it is not all the wealth of India,—nor all the luxuries and pleasures of oriental palaces,—nor all the diamonds that ever sparkled over the brow of beauty,—it is not these that can impart tranquillity to the soul , nor give peace to the conscience . Such was the bitter truth that Adeline was now compelled to acknowledge ! Shortly after the departure of Colonel Cholmondeley , which occurred at about four o'clock in the afternoon , Lady Ravensworth felt so deeply the want of undisturbed solitude for her meditations and of fresh air to relieve the stifling sensation which oppressed her , that she determined to take a long walk through the quiet fields . Hastily slipping on a plain straw bonnet and a thick warm shawl , she left the house unperceived by her torturess — Lydia Hutchinson . Passing through the spacious gardens at the back of the mansion , she gained the open fields , where the cold fresh breeze somewhat revived her drooping spirits . "
822377	822391	822374	822375	a son	26799	" she thought , as she cast a hasty but proud glance around : "
822490	822680	822681	822681	I	0	" These reflections led to a variety of others — all connected with Adeline 's interests or her sorrows . So profoundly was she plunged in her painful reverie , and at the same time so invigorated did she feel by the freshness of the air , that she insensibly prolonged her walk until the shades of evening gathered around her . She had now reached the ruined remains of a gamekeeper 's lodge which marked the boundary of the Ravensworth estate in that direction . Feeling a sudden sensation of weariness come over her , she seated herself on a bench which still existed near the dilapidated remnant of the cottage - portico . Scarcely had she taken that place , when a voice from the other side of the ruined wall caused her to start with sudden affright : but the words that met her ears conquered this first feeling of alarm , and inspired one of curiosity . She accordingly lingered where she was ; and as the darkness was every moment growing more intense , she knew there was but little danger of being perceived . "
822697	822707	822681	822681	I	0	" said the voice , in an impatient tone . "
822824	822825	822830	822830	I	0	" "
822834	822852	822830	822830	I	0	" said another voice , whose deep tones rolled solemnly upon the silence of the dark evening . "
822877	822878	822830	822830	I	0	" "
822887	822893	822884	822884	you	0	" demanded the first speaker : "
822948	822949	822941	822941	I	0	" "
822960	822971	822951	822951	you	0	" asked the individual with the deep - toned voice ; "
822983	822984	822974	822974	I	0	" "
822988	823014	822974	822974	I	0	" exclaimed the first speaker : then , after a pause , during which Adeline distinctly heard the rustling sound of paper , he said , "
823037	823038	823025	823025	I	0	" "
823046	823060	823025	823025	I	0	" returned the deep - toned voice . There was another short pause . "
823064	823073	823025	823025	I	0	" cried the first speaker , at length . "
823093	823101	823025	823025	I	0	" he added with a low chuckle . "
823157	823158	823159	823159	I	0	" "
823171	823186	823159	823159	I	0	" said the deep - toned voice , rather impatiently — and even haughtily . "
823210	823211	823204	823204	I	0	" "
823219	823493	823214	823214	I	0	" returned the other . The two individuals then separated — each taking a different way ; but one came round the angle of the ruined wall , and passed so close to Adeline that she shrank back in a dreadful state of alarm lest her presence there should be discovered;—for , mysterious as was the conversation which she had just overheard , there was one fact which it too intelligibly revealed — and this was the desperate nature of those two men 's characters . But the individual who passed so closely , did not observe her — for the evening was very dark , and she moreover was sitting in the still deeper obscurity of the ruined portico . Neither was she enabled to obtain a glimpse of his countenance : the outline of a tall and somewhat stout figure , as he hurried by her , was the extent of the view which she caught of him . In a few moments all was again silent : the sounds of the retreating footsteps no longer met her ears . She did not immediately leave the ruins : she paused to reflect upon the strange conversation which she had overheard . But all its details were dark and mysterious — save that one man was a wretch who gloried in his readiness to perform any crime for a commensurate reward , and that the other was either his accomplice or his employer in some fearful plot that was in progress . There was one expression that had fallen from the lips of the former miscreant , and on which Lady Ravensworth principally dwelt:—"Now
823514	823568	823504	823504	I	0	" Could the whereabouts , or locality , alluded to , have any connexion with that neighbourhood ? And , if so , did the observation refer to the Ravensworth estate ? Or were the two men merely discussing , in those ruins , matters which regarded some other and totally distinct spot ? "
823578	823592	823504	823504	I	0	" said Adeline to herself , after a long meditation upon the subject . "
823665	823919	823647	823647	he	1646	" Thus reasoning against the vague and temporary fears which had arisen in her mind , Adeline rose from the bench and was about to retrace her steps homewards , when the moon suddenly appeared from behind a cloud , and its rays fell upon a small white object that lay at the lady 's feet . She mechanically picked it up:—it was a piece of paper on which she could perceive , by the moonlight , that a few words were written ; but she could not decypher them . Nevertheless , the mode in which the short lines were arranged struck her with the idea that this paper contained an address ; and a natural association of facts immediately encouraged the belief that she held in her hand the one which the self - vaunted bravo had given ere now to his companion , and which the latter might probably have dropped by accident . Hastily concealing it in her bosom , Adeline retraced her steps to Ravensworth Hall . On her arrival she hurried to her boudoir , lighted the wax tapers , and examined the paper ere she even laid aside her bonnet and shawl . Yes — it contained an address ; and the words were scrawled as they would be if written in the dark . There could , then , be no doubt that this was the address which one of the men had given to his companion in the ruins of the gamekeeper 's lodge . "
823937	823956	823959	823959	he	22040	" muttered Adeline to herself , as she concealed the paper in one of her jewel - caskets . "
824039	824058	824035	824035	Lydia	1544	" continued Adeline , her brows contracting and a dark cloud passing over her countenance as she spoke , "
824071	824105	824035	824035	Lydia	1544	" But scarcely was the fearful thought thus implied , when Adeline seemed to recoil from it with horror : for , covering her face with her hands , she almost shrieked out , "
824116	824117	824110	824110	I	0	" "
824126	824152	824110	824110	I	0	" said a low voice close by her ear ; and almost at the same instant she was clasped in the arms of Colonel Cholmondeley . "
824159	824171	824110	824110	I	0	" exclaimed Adeline , struggling to free herself from his embrace . "
824185	824190	824174	824174	I	0	" returned the Colonel : "
824216	824246	824211	824211	I	0	" And as he uttered these words , he glued his lips to hers , although she still continued to resist his insolence to the utmost of her power . "
824252	824259	824211	824211	I	0	" she murmured in a faint tone "
824269	824299	824300	824300	Adeline	1545	" Cholmondeley supported her to the sofa ; then , throwing himself at her feet , he took her hands in his , and said in a fervent tone , "
824561	824597	824598	824599	your friend	26744	" With her head drooping upon her bosom,—with tears trembling upon her long dark lashes,—and with her hands still retained in those of Colonel Cholmondeley , did Adeline listen to this specious appeal . The words "
824600	824612	824620	824621	a friend	26800	" touched a chord which vibrated to her heart 's core . "
824631	824635	824623	824624	a friend	26800	" she exclaimed ; "
824644	824683	824684	824684	I	0	" Cholmondeley was man of the world enough to perceive that his appeal was successful — that his victory was complete ; and , seating himself by Adeline 's side , he drew her towards him , saying , "
824749	824750	824763	824763	your	0	" "
824766	824772	824763	824763	your	0	" cried Adeline , joyfully . "
824793	824843	824785	824785	I	0	" returned Cholmondeley . Then withdrawing his arm from her waist , as a tacit proof of his honourable intentions , but still retaining one of her hands in his own , he looked anxiously in her countenance to read the impression which his words and manner had created . "
824867	824871	824854	824854	I	0	" returned Adeline ; "
824977	824978	824982	824982	Adeline	1545	" "
824990	825002	824985	824985	your	1545	" said Cholmondeley , in a low , but tender tone . "
825103	825104	825101	825101	Lydia	1544	" "
825112	825124	825101	825101	Lydia	1544	" exclaimed Lady Ravensworth , profoundly surprised at what she heard . "
825190	825195	825188	825188	Adeline	1545	" continued the Colonel , "
825212	825213	825202	825204	that odious woman	22075	" "
825229	825234	825226	825227	a friend	26800	" said Lady Ravensworth ; "
825270	825271	825272	825272	I	0	" "
825280	825284	825278	825278	Adeline	1545	" replied Cholmondeley . "
825303	825307	825278	825278	Adeline	1545	" exclaimed Adeline . "
825331	825332	825335	825335	Adeline	1545	" "
825337	825346	825335	825335	Adeline	1545	" said Cholmondeley , in a tender tone , "
825371	825372	825364	825364	you	1545	" "
825375	825390	825364	825364	you	1545	" repeated Lady Ravensworth , with a tone and manner expressive of unfeigned surprise . "
825419	825420	825421	825421	My	0	" "
825433	825440	825421	825422	My God	27430	" cried Adeline , seriously alarmed . "
825451	825478	825447	825447	I	0	" Cholmondeley was now astonished in his turn ; and hastily taking a paper from his pocket , he handed it to Lady Ravensworth , saying , "
825486	825501	825447	825447	I	0	" Adeline cast her eyes upon the paper , and read these words : — "
825601	825602	825633	825633	Lydia	1544	" "
825606	825619	825633	825633	Lydia	1544	" ejaculated Adeline , when she had hurriedly glanced over the paper : "
825646	825680	825633	825633	Lydia	1544	" There was the wildness of despair in the manner of Lady Ravensworth , as she uttered these words ; and Cholmondeley could not for another moment imagine that her distress was feigned . "
825688	825692	825694	825694	you	1545	" he said : "
825714	825715	825712	825712	yours	1545	" "
825724	825730	825722	825722	Cholmondeley	1541	" she answered , emphatically , "
825783	825816	825774	825774	Cholmondeley	1541	" The Colonel dared not delay another moment : the almost desperate wildness of Adeline 's manner convinced him that she spoke the truth — that she had not invited him thither . "
825834	825846	825820	825820	me	0	" he said , imprinting a hasty kiss upon her forehead . "
825863	825934	825853	825853	you	1541	" she cried , in a tone of agonising alarm . Cholmondeley rushed to the door:—Adeline followed him into the passage , bearing a candle in her hand . The reader may conceive the relief which she experienced , when , upon casting a rapid glance up and down , she found that her torturess was not there either to expose her completely , or to triumph over her alarms . "
825937	825984	826048	826048	she	1544	" whispered Cholmondeley ; and he disappeared down the staircase . Adeline remained at the top , until she heard the private door at the bottom carefully open and as gently close . Then she breathed more freely , and re - entered her own chamber . "
825994	826013	826014	826014	She	1544	" she murmured to herself , as she sank upon the sofa , exhausted both mentally and bodily . "
826051	826073	826048	826048	she	1544	" Scarcely had these words passed Adeline 's lips , when the door opened , and her torturess entered the room . "
826083	826105	826080	826081	terrible woman	22087	" cried Adeline , advancing towards Lydia Hutchinson , and giving vent to the question which was uppermost in her mind . "
826127	826138	826108	826108	you	22087	" said Lydia , with a smile of triumphant contempt . "
826154	826158	826142	826142	you	22087	" began Adeline . "
826169	826175	826142	826142	you	22087	" interrupted Lydia , coolly ; "
826195	826196	826183	826184	Colonel Cholmondeley	1541	" "
826208	826220	826198	826198	you	22087	" cried Lady Ravensworth , in a tone bitter with rage . "
826237	826241	826242	826243	Merciful God	880	" returned Lydia . "
826253	826258	826245	826245	you	22087	" screamed Lady Ravensworth . "
826272	826273	826263	826263	you	22087	" "
826279	826290	826274	826274	I	0	" replied Lydia , in her calm , impassive manner . "
826302	826340	826341	826341	You	0	" said Adeline , conquering the turbulent emotions of passion which agitated within her , and flinging herself once more upon the sofa , while her thoughts wandered to the address concealed in the casket of jewels . "
826346	826352	826341	826341	You	0	" repeated Lydia , scornfully . "
826411	826412	826413	826413	Wretch	1062	" "
826415	826424	826413	826413	Wretch	1062	" muttered Adeline , hoarsely between her teeth . "
826434	826438	826413	826413	Wretch	1062	" said Lydia . "
826560	826561	826557	826557	I	0	" "
826574	826578	826566	826566	you	0	" cried Adeline . "
826583	826587	826566	826566	you	0	" answered Lydia : "
826604	826605	826588	826588	I	0	" "
826622	826623	826608	826608	you	0	" "
826664	826677	826678	826680	such a friend	22103	" continued Lydia , in a tone of the most mordent sarcasm : "
826755	826756	826749	826749	you	0	" "
826775	826779	826766	826766	you	0	" exclaimed Adeline . "
826786	826790	826783	826783	my	0	" replied Lydia ; "
826823	826824	826827	826827	you	0	" "
826844	826865	826827	826827	you	0	" cried Adeline , her thoughts again reverting to the address which she had concealed in her jewel - casket . "
826882	826886	826873	826873	you	0	" returned Lydia ; "
826917	826950	826905	826905	I	0	" Adeline made no answer : her mind now dwelt with less horror than before upon the possible use which she might be driven to make of the address in the casket . "
826961	826965	826905	826905	I	0	" exclaimed Lydia ; "
827042	827057	827058	827058	I	0	" Adeline started convulsively , but checked the reply which rose to her lips . "
827070	827074	827067	827068	the housekeeper	39575	" continued Lydia ; "
827151	827152	827143	827144	the housekeeper	39575	" "
827155	827163	827153	827153	Quentin	1704	" cried Adeline , with a shudder . "
827188	827192	827179	827179	they	22116	" continued Lydia . "
827306	827307	827311	827311	you	0	" "
827325	827351	827311	827311	you	0	" cried Lady Ravensworth , trembling as she beheld ruin and disgrace yawning like a black precipice at her feet , ready to engulph her : "
827375	827376	827354	827354	you	0	" "
827388	827392	827393	827393	I	0	" answered Lydia : "
827459	827460	827469	827469	you	0	" "
827474	827480	827469	827469	you	0	" exclaimed Adeline , bitterly : "
827510	827511	827499	827499	your	0	" "
827515	827521	827499	827499	your	0	" cried Lydia , emphatically : "
827532	827533	827528	827528	I	0	" "
827574	827588	827589	827589	I	0	" said Lady Ravensworth , pressing her clasped hands convulsively to her heart . "
827598	827603	827594	827594	I	0	" returned Lydia coldly : "
827681	827682	827671	827672	The housekeeper	39575	" "
827696	827700	827686	827686	you	0	" exclaimed Adeline . "
827711	827712	827703	827703	God	880	" "
827730	828297	827721	827721	he	30221	" With these words Lydia Hutchinson left the boudoir . It was now nine o'clock in the evening : Mr. Graham had been left to dine alone ; and Adeline felt the necessity of proceeding to the drawing - room , to join her guest in partaking of coffee . A plea of indisposition was offered for her absence from the dinner - table ; and to her questions concerning his patient , Mr. Graham replied favourably . The evening dragged its slow length wearily along ; for Adeline was too much depressed in spirits to prove a very agreeable companion . She moreover fancied she beheld an impudent leer upon the countenances of the domestics who served the coffee ; and this circumstance , although in reality imaginary , only tended to complete her confusion and paralyse her powers of conversation . Were it not that she now dreamt of vengeance in her turn,—were it not that she beheld a chance of speedily ridding herself for ever of the torturess whom circumstances had inflicted upon her,—she could not possibly have endured the weight of the last indignity forced upon her . To be made the object , as she deemed herself to be , of her very servants ' scandalous talk and insulting looks , was a position so utterly debasing , that she would have fled from it by means of suicide , had she not consoled herself by the idea that a terrible vengeance on the authoress of her degradation was within her reach . Crime is like an object of terror seen dimly through the obscurity of night . When afar off from it , the appearance of that object is so vaguely horrible — so shapelessly appalling , that it makes the hair stand on end ; but the more the eye contemplates it — the more familiar the beholder grows with its aspect — and the nearer he advances towards it , the less terrible does it become ; until at length , when he goes close up to it , and touches it , he wonders that he was ever so weak as to be alarmed by it . We have seen Lady Ravensworth recoiling with horror from the bare idea of perpetrating the crime which the possession of the self - vaunted bravo 's address suggested to her imagination:—the next time it entered her thoughts , she was less terrified;—a few hours passed — and she was now pondering calmly and coldly upon the subject . O God ! what is the cause of this ? Is there implanted in the heart of man a natural tendency towards even the blackest crimes — a tendency which only requires the influence of particular circumstances to develop it to its dark and terrible extreme ? We may here explain the motives which had induced Colonel Cholmondeley to endeavour to renew his connexion with Adeline . Of love remaining for her he had none — even if he had ever experienced any at all . But his interests might have been probably served by the restoration of his former influence over her . He was a man of ruined fortunes — having dissipated a large property ; and although he still contrived to maintain appearances , the struggle was a severe one , and only kept up with the desperate view of "
828302	828582	827721	827721	he	30221	" Thus , when he found the letter and the key in the carriage — naturally presuming that Adeline had herself thereby intimated her readiness to renew their former liaison,—he began to reflect that Lord Ravensworth was dying — that Lady Ravensworth might , should she have a son , be speedily left a wealthy widow — or that at all events she must acquire some fortune at her husband 's decease,—and that he should be acting prudently to adopt all possible means to regain his ancient influence over her . This explanation will account for his readiness to act in accordance with the hint which he had fancied to have been conveyed by Adeline through the medium of the letter and the key : it will also show wherefore he humoured her , during their interview , in respect to accepting the colder denomination of friend , instead of the warmer one of lover . The reader may imagine his confusion , when an explanation took place relative to the letter and the key ; nor need we describe the bitter feelings with which he beat his ignominious retreat . It was eleven o'clock at night . Mr. Graham had just left his patient in a profound sleep , and had retired to the bed - room allotted to him , Lydia Hutchinson having already come to keep the promised vigil by the couch of the wounded nobleman . The curtains were drawn around the bed : waxlights burnt upon the mantel . A deep silence reigned throughout the mansion . Lydia Hutchinson threw herself back in the arm - chair , and gave way to her reflections . "
828858	828881	828882	828882	Graham	1753	" She had reached this point in her musings , when Lord Dunstable moved , and coughed gently . He was awake . "
828884	828893	828882	828882	Graham	1753	" he murmured , in a faint tone : "
828908	828909	828882	828882	Graham	1753	" "
828916	828920	828882	828882	Graham	1753	" answered Lydia : "
828931	828956	828957	828957	Lydia	1544	" Thus speaking , she drew aside the curtains . Lord Dunstable cast one glance up to that countenance which looked malignantly on him . "
828959	828963	828966	828966	you	1544	" he said : "
828976	828977	828966	828966	you	1544	" "
829012	829020	828980	828981	Lydia Hutchinson	1544	" was the calm and measured reply . "
829030	829058	829026	829028	none else present	22148	" asked Dunstable , in a tone of alarm . Lydia drew the curtains completely aside ; and the nobleman cast a hasty look round the room . "
829067	829071	829073	829073	you	1544	" she said ; "
829079	829080	829083	829083	you	1544	" "
829090	829094	829083	829083	you	1544	" he exclaimed : "
829106	829107	829095	829095	you	1544	" "
829122	829128	829108	829108	I	0	" interrupted the avenging woman . "
829160	829161	829157	829158	a murderer	27686	" "
829171	829184	829163	829164	a man	2001	" said Dunstable , darting a savage glance towards Lydia 's countenance , "
829194	829195	829185	829185	he	2001	" "
829208	829217	829205	829206	a ravisher	22155	" cried Lydia , in a taunting tone . "
829299	829300	829301	829301	Lydia	1544	" "
829309	829314	829303	829303	Lydia	1544	" cried Lord Dunstable ; "
829332	829333	829337	829337	you	1544	" "
829356	829360	829337	829337	you	1544	" continued Lydia . "
829490	829491	829484	829484	you	1544	" "
829543	829556	829596	829596	you	1544	" said Dunstable , speaking contemptuously , and yet with great difficulty . "
829569	829589	829590	829590	I	0	" replied Lydia , in a hoarse voice that indicated the rage which these words excited in her bosom . "
829809	829952	829801	829801	your	1544	" Weak as was the young nobleman 's frame,—attenuated as was his mind by suffering and by prostration of the physical energies , it is not to be wondered at if those terrible reproaches produced a strange effect upon him,—uttered as they were , too , in a tone of savage malignity , and by a woman with whom he found himself alone at an hour when all the other inmates of the mansion were probably rocked in slumber . That evanescent gleam of a naturally spirited disposition which had enabled him to meet her first taunts with a contemptuous reply , had disappeared ; and he now found himself prostrated in mind and body — rapidly yielding to nervous feelings and vague alarms — and almost inclined to believe himself to be the black - hearted criminal which Lydia represented him . "
829970	829974	829801	829801	your	1544	" proceeded Lydia , "
830161	830162	830165	830165	Lydia	1544	" "
830169	830174	830165	830165	Lydia	1544	" murmured Lord Dunstable : "
830186	830187	830182	830182	I	0	" "
830206	830207	830201	830201	you	1544	" "

830274	830278	830280	830281	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" added Lydia ; "
830290	830291	830283	830283	Adeline	1545	" "
830297	830304	830292	830292	I	0	" said Lord Dunstable , faintly : "
830311	830312	830308	830308	you	1544	" "
830322	830323	830308	830308	you	1544	" "
830332	830333	830326	830326	Lydia,—Oh	1759	" "
830347	830348	830344	830344	you	1544	" "
830364	830365	830360	830360	you	1544	" "
830375	830381	830371	830371	I	0	" said Lydia , imperiously . "
830388	830389	830382	830382	I	0	" "
830396	830397	830398	830400	A vile seducer	22188	" "
830411	830412	830382	830382	I	0	" "
830429	830430	830398	830400	A vile seducer	22188	" "
830435	830448	830398	830400	A vile seducer	22188	" said Dunstable , writhing with the pangs of an intolerable thirst . "
830455	830456	830457	830457	You	1544	" "
830470	830471	830472	830472	I	0	" "
830478	830484	830485	830485	I	0	" exclaimed the miserable nobleman . "
830497	830498	830491	830491	I	0	" "
830504	830510	830527	830527	I	0	" returned Lydia , ferociously . "
830551	830552	830527	830527	I	0	" "
830572	830589	830556	830556	you	1544	" said Lydia , holding a glass of lemonade at a short distance from his lips . "
830596	830613	830614	830614	You	1544	" murmured Dunstable , almost driven to madness by the excruciating anguish of his burning thirst . "
830629	830643	830644	830644	I	0	" continued Lydia , advancing the glass still nearer to his parched mouth . "
830655	830692	830693	830693	I	0	" Then Lydia allowed him to drink as much as he chose of the refreshing beverage . At that moment the time - piece struck one , and a low knock was heard at the door . "
830698	830712	830693	830693	I	0	" said Lydia , in a whisper , as she leant over him . "
830781	830811	830812	830812	His	22197	" Lord Dunstable groaned in anguish , and closed his eyes — as if against some horrific spectre . Lydia smiled triumphantly , and hastened to admit the housekeeper . "
830818	830834	830836	830836	he	22197	" she whispered to the person who thus came to relieve her in the vigil ; "
830849	830850	830836	830836	he	22197	" "
830859	830875	830836	830836	he	22197	" answered the housekeeper , also in a low tone , inaudible to the invalid . "
830879	830880	830836	830836	he	22197	" "
830884	831033	830836	830836	he	22197	" returned Lydia . She then withdrew — satisfied at having adopted a precautionary measure in case the nobleman should utter a complaint against her . And she retired to her own chamber gloating ever the vengeance which she had already taken upon the man who had ruined her , and happy in the hope of being enabled to renew those torments on the ensuing night . We must conclude this chapter with an incident which has an important bearing upon events that are to follow . Adeline arose early on the morning following that dread night of vengeance , and dressed herself before Lydia made her appearance in the boudoir . Hastening down stairs , Lady Ravensworth ordered breakfast to be immediately served , and the carriage to be got ready . When she returned to the boudoir to assume her travelling attire , Lydia was there . "
831043	831047	831034	831034	You	22198	" she said ; "
831062	831063	831058	831058	you	22198	" "
831079	831083	831070	831070	Lydia	1544	" answered Adeline ; "
831103	831104	831100	831100	I	0	" "
831133	831141	831130	831130	you	22198	" she demanded in an authoritative manner . "
831153	831181	831130	831130	you	22198	" was the reply , which Adeline gave meekly — for she had her own reasons not to waste time by irritating her torturess on this occasion . "
831188	831192	831186	831186	Adeline	1545	" said Lydia : "
831236	831273	831274	831274	You	1545	" Adeline was now ready to depart ; and Lydia attended her , for appearance ' sake , to the carriage . Ere the door of the vehicle was closed , Lady Ravensworth said to Lydia , "
831309	831321	831330	831330	you	1545	" Lydia darted upon her mistress a glance which was intended to say—"You
831333	831345	831330	831330	you	1545	command;"—but she answered aloud , in an assumed tone of respect , "
831351	831385	831330	831330	you	1545	" The footman closed the door — and the carriage drove rapidly away for the town - mansion at the West End . And as it rolled along , Adeline mused thus : — "
831481	831693	831473	831473	Lydia	1544	" Then , as she smiled with demoniac triumph , Adeline took from her bosom and devoured with her eyes the address that she had picked up in the ruins of the gamekeeper 's cottage . There was only an old housekeeper maintained at the town - mansion , to take care of the dwelling ; and thus Adeline was under no apprehension of having her motions watched . Immediately after her arrival , which was shortly before eleven in the forenoon , she repaired to a chamber , having given instructions that as she had many letters to write , she desired to remain uninterrupted . But scarcely had the housekeeper withdrawn , when Adeline enveloped herself in a large cloak , put on a common straw bonnet with a thick black veil , and left the house by a private door of which she possessed the key . It was on the same morning when Adeline came to London in the manner just described , that Anthony Tidkins emerged from his dwelling , hastened up the dark alley , and entered the ground - floor of the building . He was not , however , alone:—Mr . Banks , who had been breakfasting with him , followed close behind . "
831701	831716	831473	831473	Lydia	1544	" said the Resurrection Man , when they were both in the back room ; "
831736	831737	831738	831738	I	0	" "
831742	831746	831738	831738	I	0	" returned Banks . "
831782	831783	831784	831784	I	0	" "
831790	831798	831784	831784	I	0	" observed the Resurrection Man , coolly : "
831857	831858	831853	831853	she	30983	" "
831861	831865	831853	831853	she	30983	" returned Banks , "
831927	831928	831923	831924	the surgeon	29781	" "
831934	831938	831923	831924	the surgeon	29781	" said Tidkins : "
831978	832124	832141	832142	old woman	37392	" The Resurrection Man descended the stone staircase , followed by Banks , who carried the light . In a few moments they entered the vault where their prisoner was confined . And that prisoner was the vile hag of Golden Lane ! A lamp burned feebly upon the table in the subterranean ; and the old woman was already up and dressed when the two men made their appearance . She was sitting in a chair , dolefully rocking herself to and fro , and uttering low moans as she pondered upon her condition and the terms on which she might obtain her release . When the Resurrection Man and Banks entered the subterranean , she turned a hasty glance towards them , and then continued to rock and moan as before . The two men seated themselves on the side of the bed . "
832127	832133	832135	832135	you	22220	" said the Resurrection Man , "
832179	832180	832181	832181	Alack	1683	" "
832191	832197	832187	832187	myself	0	" said the old hag ; "

832227	832235	832219	832219	you	22220	" returned the Resurrection Man , savagely . "
832293	832294	832280	832280	you	22220	" "
832299	832308	832280	832280	you	22220	" murmured the hag , still rocking herself . "
832316	832322	832310	832310	I	0	" answered the Resurrection Man . "
832414	832415	832404	832404	you	22220	" "
832428	832434	832435	832435	Alack	1683	" moaned the old hag . "
832439	832440	832435	832435	Alack	1683	" "
832448	832452	832441	832441	You	22220	" answered Tidkins . "
832695	832696	832686	832686	I	0	" "
832701	832707	832686	832686	I	0	" moaned the old woman . "
832715	832719	832710	832710	I	0	" continued the Resurrection Man;—"enough
833038	833039	833022	833022	you	22220	" "
833054	833064	833069	833069	you	22220	" murmured the horrible crone , shaking her head . "
833077	833078	833069	833069	you	22220	" "
833091	833097	833118	833118	Ned	1152	" exclaimed the Resurrection Man . "
833108	833113	833118	833118	Ned	1152	" added Mr. Banks . "
833120	833124	833118	833118	Ned	1152	" returned Tidkins . "
833365	833366	833356	833357	old woman	37392	" "
833373	833378	833356	833357	old woman	37392	" crooned the harridan . "
833387	833411	833412	833412	she	22260	" said Banks , shaking his head with that solemnity which he had affected so long as at length to use it mechanically : "
833446	833447	833440	833444	Jones the grave - digger	22263	" "
833453	833486	833451	833451	Satan	1204	" suddenly ejaculated the Resurrection Man , starting up , and laying his iron hand on the hag 's shoulder so as to prevent her from rocking to and fro any longer ; "
833515	833528	833530	833530	you	22220	" he shouted in her ears , as he shook her violently : "
833544	833545	833530	833530	you	22220	" "
833552	833557	833580	833580	God	880	" cried the hag : "
833561	833562	833580	833580	God	880	" "
833570	833576	833563	833563	I	0	" ejaculated the Resurrection Man ; "
833599	833600	833597	833597	Banks	1300	" "
833617	833622	833597	833597	Banks	1300	" answered the undertaker . "
833630	833636	833637	833637	I	0	" said the Resurrection Man . "
833646	833650	833637	833637	I	0	" observed Banks ; "
833660	833661	833652	833652	I	0	" "
833669	833673	833674	833674	they	22268	" exclaimed Tidkins : "
833708	833709	833710	833710	I	0	" "
833715	833735	833736	833736	I	0	" returned Banks , with as much complacency as if a party of pleasure had been proposed to him . "
833744	833745	833738	833738	you	0	" "
833767	833771	833772	833772	You	0	" answered Tidkins . "
833801	833941	833795	833797	the old woman	26813	" The undertaker departed to execute this commission ; and Tidkins again reasoned with the hag . But all he could get out of her was a moaning exclamation ; and as soon as he withdrew his hand from her shoulder , she began rocking backwards and forwards as before . It suddenly struck the Resurrection Man that she was actually losing her senses through the rigours of confinement ; and he became alarmed — not on her account , but for the secret which he wished to extort from her . As this idea flashed to his mind , he cast a rapid glance towards the old woman ; and surprised her as she herself was scrutinising his countenance with the most intense interest , while she was all the time pretending to be listlessly rocking her self . "
833948	833951	833795	833797	the old woman	26813	" ejaculated Tidkins "
834094	834095	834128	834128	you	22273	" "
834105	834125	834126	834126	I	0	" said the hag , seeing that her new design was detected and that it was useless to persist in it,—"if
834145	834146	834135	834135	you	22273	" "
834175	834183	834170	834170	you	22273	" replied the Resurrection Man , sternly . "
834253	834307	834247	834247	Banks	1300	" The undertaker made his appearance , laden with the articles for which he had been sent . The Resurrection Man laid the wood and coals in the brazier , and applied a match . In a few moments there was a bright blaze , which he fanned by means of the bellows . "
834320	834326	834331	834331	Jones	1584	" said Tidkins , coolly . "
834348	834353	834339	834339	he	1584	" returned Mr. Banks . "
834368	834377	834378	834378	I	0	" said the hag , now really alarmed . "
834385	834386	834378	834378	I	0	" "
834391	834397	834402	834402	you	998	" growled the Resurrection Man . "
834406	834407	834402	834402	you	998	" "
834426	834432	834434	834434	I	0	" continued the old woman ; "
834441	834442	834434	834434	I	0	" "
834453	834454	834434	834434	I	0	" "
834465	834470	834434	834434	I	0	" added the hag . "
834501	834512	834492	834492	she	1161	" repeated the old woman , with a cunning leer ; "
834523	834524	834492	834492	she	1161	" "
834538	834542	834526	834526	you	998	" said Tidkins ; "
834551	834552	834546	834546	Banks	1300	" "
834555	834567	834546	834546	Banks	1300	" observed the undertaker , smoothing his limp cravat - ends : "
834596	834597	834568	834569	Edward Banks	1152	" "
834604	834620	834602	834602	Ned	1152	" cried Tidkins : then addressing himself again to the old woman , he said , "
834633	834634	834624	834624	you	998	" "
834641	834646	834624	834624	you	998	" exclaimed the hag . "
834669	834670	834662	834662	you	998	" "
834678	834684	834685	834685	I	0	" demanded Tidkins , eagerly . "
834691	834696	834688	834688	I	0	" was the reply . "
834701	834702	834688	834688	I	0	" "
834733	834741	834724	834724	they	22283	" And again the hag leered cunningly . "
834750	834770	834724	834724	they	22283	" mused the Resurrection Man , now hesitating between his avarice and his desire to possess such important testimony . "
834773	834779	834781	834781	your	998	" he continued , after a pause,—"to
834864	834865	834866	834866	Alack	1683	" "
834876	834881	834866	834866	Alack	1683	" said the hag . "
834895	834896	834897	834897	I	0	" "
834905	834909	834897	834897	I	0	" returned Tidkins . "
834996	834997	834998	834998	I	0	" "
835001	835006	834998	834998	I	0	" answered the hag . "
835013	835053	834998	834998	I	0	" Tidkins departed to fetch writing materials , food , some strong liquor , and oil for the old woman 's lamp . In five minutes he returned ; and , placing those articles upon the table , said , "
835061	835062	834998	834998	I	0	" "
835070	835075	834998	834998	I	0	" returned the hag : "
835088	835096	834998	834998	I	0	" And she heaved a deep sigh . "
835105	835327	834998	834998	I	0	" said the Resurrection Man . He and Banks then fastened the huge door upon the old woman , and left the subterranean . When they reached the street , the undertaker departed in the direction of his own house ; and the Resurrection Man ascended to his apartment on the first floor . Mr. Tidkins sate down and smoked his pipe as calmly as if he were not at all afraid to be left alone to the company of the thoughts which the occupation was likely to stir up within him . For when a man takes up his pipe , all the most important ideas in his brain are certain to present themselves to his contemplation ; and think on them he must , willing or unwilling . But Tidkins shrank not from any of those reflections : he was not one of your villains who are either afraid in the dark , or who loathe solitude;—what he did he perpetrated systematically , and reviewed coolly . He did not have recourse to the pipe on account of its soothing qualities — for as long as he made money , he had no cares ; and when he indulged in a glass , it was by no means to drown remorse — because he had no compunctions to stifle . "
835343	835349	835337	835337	I	0	" he mused to himself : "
835682	835724	835892	835892	Tidkins	998	" The Resurrection Man looked at his watch:—the time had passed rapidly away while he was smoking and thinking;—and it was now nearly an hour past mid - day . The knock — which was low and timid — was repeated . "
835730	835868	835892	835892	Tidkins	998	" said Tidkins ; and he hastened down to the street door . He opened it and beheld a lady , enveloped in a large cloak , and wearing a black veil which was so elaborately worked and so well arranged in thick folds that it was impossible to catch even the faintest glimpse of the countenance that it concealed . Tidkins , however , perceived at the first glance that it was no mean person who had sought his abode ; for the delicate kid gloves were drawn on the small hands with a scrupulous nicety ; the foot which rested upon the door - step was diminutive to a fault ; and the appearance of the lady , even disguised as she was , had something of superiority and command which could not be mistaken . "
835875	835888	835870	835871	Mr. Tidkins	998	" she said , in a tremulous and half - affrighted tone . "
835900	835983	835892	835892	Tidkins	998	" answered the Resurrection Man , in as polite a manner as he could possibly assume . It seemed as if the lady looked at him through her veil for a few moments , ere she made a reply ; and she even appeared to shudder as she made that survey . And no wonder;—for a countenance with a more sinister expression never met her eyes ; and she had moreover recognised the man 's voice , which she had heard before . "
835991	836000	835985	835985	you	26745	" said Tidkins ; seeing that she hesitated . "
836029	836227	836228	836228	I	0	" For another instant did Adeline—(there is no necessity to affect mystery here)—hesitate ere she accepted this invitation:—then she thought of her torturess Lydia — and she boldly crossed the threshold . But when Tidkins closed and bolted the door behind her , and she found herself ascending the steep staircase,—when she remembered that she was now alone in that house with a man concerning whom her notions were of the most appalling nature,—she felt her legs tremble beneath her . Then again was she compelled to encourage herself by rapidly passing in mental review the horrors of those tortures and the extent of those indignities which she endured at the hands of Lydia Hutchinson!—and her strength immediately revived . She ascended the stairs , and entered the back room , to which the Resurrection Man directed her in language as polite as he could command . Then , having placed a chair for his mysterious visitor near the fire , he took another at a respectful distance from her — for he knew that it would be impolitic to alarm one who was evidently a well - bred lady , by appearing to be too familiar . "
836256	836270	836271	836271	I	0	" said Adeline , after a long pause , but still fearfully embarrassed . "
836285	836289	836290	836290	I	0	" replied Tidkins : "
836376	836377	836360	836360	you	22311	" "
836384	836399	836360	836360	you	22311	" returned Adeline : then , after a moment 's thought , she said , "
836429	836430	836434	836434	ma'am	26745	" "
836436	836440	836434	836434	ma'am	26745	" answered Tidkins . "
836449	836450	836451	836451	I	0	" "
836459	836464	836451	836451	I	0	" said Lady Ravensworth . "
836484	836485	836492	836492	ma'am	26745	" "
836494	836518	836492	836492	ma'am	26745	" observed Tidkins , his countenance brightening up considerably at the prospect of reaping a good harvest by means of his new customer . "
836571	836572	836575	836575	you	26745	" "
836605	836619	836598	836598	I	0	" And Adeline was seized by a sudden paroxysm of remorse and alarm . "
836625	836629	836621	836621	yourself	26745	" said Tidkins . "
836960	836961	837001	837003	a bitter enemy	22348	" "
836967	836995	837001	837003	a bitter enemy	22348	" added Lady Ravensworth , hastily — for she had been enabled to collect her thoughts and compose herself while Tidkins was thus expatiating upon his exploits . "
837005	837007	837001	837003	a bitter enemy	22348	" he repeated;—"it
837015	837022	837001	837003	a bitter enemy	22348	for,"—and he lowered his voice as he spoke—"I
837054	837060	837046	837046	I	0	" he added , significantly . "
837090	837099	837100	837100	I	0	" said Adeline , catching at this alternative . "
837105	837111	837100	837100	I	0	" was the calm reply . "
837130	837147	837124	837124	you	0	" demanded Adeline , a vague suspicion entering her mind that this fearful man knew her . "
837157	837158	837148	837148	I	0	" "
837175	837187	837161	837161	ma'am	26745	" answered Tidkins , who divined the motive of her observations . "
837297	837298	837299	837299	I	0	" "
837303	837318	837299	837299	I	0	" answered Adeline , reassured that she was not known to the Resurrection Man : "
837326	837327	837323	837324	a woman	3385	" "
837344	837348	837334	837335	a woman	3385	" said Tidkins . "
837366	837367	837368	837368	I	0	" "
837371	837394	837368	837368	I	0	" replied Adeline , in a low and hoarse tone — as if she only uttered those monosyllables with a great exertion . "
837402	837410	837400	837400	ma'am	26745	" said the Resurrection Man , significantly : "
837419	837420	837421	837421	I	0	" "
837425	837432	837423	837423	you	26745	" interrupted Lady Ravensworth , hastily . "
837464	837465	837466	837467	The dead	14821	" "
837472	837951	837952	837953	Mr. Tidkins	998	" observed Tidkins , in a low and measured tone . Adeline shuddered , and made no reply . She fell back in the chair , and rapidly reviewed in her mind all the perils and circumstances of her position . She wished to rid herself of Lydia Hutchinson — for ever ! She was moreover anxious that this object should be effected in a manner so mysterious and secret that she might not afterwards find herself at the mercy of the agent whom she employed in her criminal purpose . She had , indeed , already settled a plan to that effect , ere she called upon Tidkins . During the whole of the preceding night had she pondered upon that terrible scheme ; and so well digested was it that Lydia might be made away with — murdered , in fine — and yet Tidkins would never know whom he had thus cut off , where the deed was accomplished , nor by whom he had been employed . Thus , according to that project , all traces of the crime would disappear , without the possibility of ever fixing it upon herself . Now this idea was disturbed by the hint thrown out relative to imprisonment in a dungeon . Were such a scheme carried into effect , Tidkins must know who his prisoner was , and by whom he was employed . A hundred chances might lead to an exposure , or enable Lydia to effect her escape . Moreover , by adopting this project , Adeline saw that she should be placing herself at the mercy of a ferocious man , who might become an extortioner , and perpetually menace her by virtue of the secret that would be in his keeping . She felt that she should live in constant alarm lest Lydia might effect her release by bribery or accident . But chiefly did she reason that she had suffered so much at the hand of one who was acquainted with a dread secret concerning her , that she shrank from the idea of so placing herself at the mercy of another . All these arguments were reviewed by the desperate woman in far less time than we have occupied in their narration . But while she was thus wrapped up in her awful reverie , Tidkins , who guessed to a certain extent what was passing in her mind , sate silently and patiently awaiting her decision between the two alternatives proposed — a dungeon or death ! Had he been able to penetrate with a glance through the folds of that dark veil , he would have beholden a countenance livid white , and distorted with the fell thoughts which occupied the mind of his visitor:—but never once during this interview did he obtain a glimpse of her features . "
837955	837971	837952	837953	Mr. Tidkins	998	" at length said Adeline , in a low tone and with a visible shudder , "
838022	838023	838026	838026	your	22370	" "
838030	838036	838026	838026	your	22370	" returned the Resurrection Man . "
838046	838088	838026	838026	your	22370	" exclaimed Adeline , stifling all feelings of compunction : then taking from beneath her cloak a heavy bag , she threw it upon the table , the chink of gold sounding most welcome to the ears of the Resurrection Man . "
838096	838100	838026	838026	your	22370	" she continued : "
838127	838128	838122	838122	I	0	" "
838139	838153	838122	838122	I	0	" said Tidkins , his eyes sparkling with joy beneath their shaggy brows . "
838166	838167	838159	838159	I	0	" "
838173	838182	838159	838159	I	0	" continued Adeline , forcing herself to speak with calmness:—"you
838277	838278	838272	838272	you	998	" "
838289	838312	838279	838279	I	0	" answered Tidkins , overjoyed at the prospect of obtaining such an important addition to the ill - gotten gains already hoarded . "
838321	838322	838317	838317	I	0	" "
838341	838345	838317	838317	I	0	" replied Adeline . "
838354	838394	838346	838346	I	0	" said the Resurrection Man . Lady Ravensworth then took her departure . As soon as it was dusk , Tidkins filled a basket with provisions , and repaired to the subterranean dungeon where the old hag was confined . "
838401	838414	838397	838397	you	998	" he demanded , as he placed the basket upon the table . "
838425	838431	838346	838346	I	0	" returned the old woman : "
838447	838448	838346	838346	I	0	" "
838466	838470	838450	838450	you	998	" said Tidkins . "
838541	838542	838527	838527	yours	998	" "
838555	838560	838549	838549	I	0	" answered the hag . "
838574	838575	838576	838576	You	998	" "
838587	838591	838576	838576	You	998	" returned Tidkins : "
838601	838653	838599	838599	yourself	998	" He then closed the door , bolted it carefully , and quitted the subterranean . While he was engaged in making some little changes in his toilet ere he sallied forth to his appointment with the veiled lady , he thus mused upon a project which he had conceived : — "
838763	838908	838756	838756	she	28625	" Having thus reasoned against the project which he had for a moment considered feasible , the Resurrection Man armed himself with a dagger and pistols , enveloped himself in his cloak , slouched his hat over his forbidding countenance , and then took his departure . It wanted five minutes to nine o'clock when Anthony Tidkins reached the corner of Oxford Street and the Edgeware Road . A cab was standing a few yards up the latter thoroughfare ; and as the driver was sitting quietly on his box , without endeavouring to catch a fare , it instantly struck the Resurrection Man that his unknown patroness might be the occupant of the vehicle , and was waiting for him . He accordingly approached the window , and by the reflection of a shop gas - light , perceived the veiled lady inside . "
838913	838927	838911	838911	you	22385	" she said , unable to distinguish his countenance beneath his slouched hat . "
838935	838969	838930	838930	ma'am	26745	" he cried to the driver ; and , opening the door , entered the cab . It then moved rapidly away — the driver having evidently received his instructions before - hand . "
838975	838983	838984	838984	You	22385	" said the lady . Tidkins obeyed . "
838992	838996	838986	838986	your	22385	" continued Adeline . "
839008	839069	838986	838986	your	22385	" He had taken off his hat upon entering the vehicle ; and Adeline now drew over his head a large flesh - coloured silk cap , or bag , fitted with a string that enabled her to gather it in and fasten it round his neck — but not so tightly as to impede the free current of air . "
839083	839111	839070	839070	I	0	" she said , loathing herself at the same time for being compelled to address this conciliatory language to such a man — a murderer by profession ! "
839128	839409	839117	839117	ma'am	26745	" A profound silence then ensued between them . On his part the Resurrection Man , who was intimately acquainted with London and all its multitudinous mazes , endeavoured to follow in his mind the course which the vehicle was taking ; and for some time he was enabled to calculate it accurately enough . But it presently turned off to the left , and shortly afterwards took several windings , which completely baffled his reckoning . He accordingly abandoned the labour , and trusted to accident to furnish him with the clue which he desired . On her side , Adeline was a prey to the most horrible emotions . Now that she had carried the dread proceedings up to the point which they had reached , she recoiled from urging them to the awful catastrophe . Vainly did she endeavour to tranquillise herself with the specious reasoning that she would not become a murderess , since her hands were not to do the deed,—or that even if that name must attach itself to her , she was justified in adopting any means , however extreme , to rid herself of a remorseless enemy:—vainly did she thus argue:—the crime she was about to commit , or to have committed for her , seemed appalling ! Often during this long ride was she on the point of declaring to her terrible companion that she would stop short and abandon the murderous project at once : and then would come soul - harrowing remembrances of Lydia 's tyranny , accompanied by violent longings after vengeance . Thus did nearly three quarters of an hour pass , when the cab suddenly halted . "
839431	839484	839117	839117	ma'am	26745	" said Adeline in a rapid whisper . The Resurrection Man understood her ; and the darkness of the night favoured the precautions which Lady Ravensworth had suggested to prevent the driver , who opened the door , from observing that Tidkins 's face was covered with the flesh - coloured silk . "
839490	839494	839117	839117	ma'am	26745	" said Adeline : "
839512	839674	839675	839675	My	0	" And she placed a piece of gold in the man 's hand . She then took the arm of Tidkins and hurried him across the fields — for such he could feel the soil upon which he was walking to be . In this manner did they proceed for upwards of half an hour , when they reached the fence surrounding the gardens of Ravensworth Hall . Adeline opened the wicket by means of a key which she had with her , and hurried her companion through the grounds to the private door at the southern extremity of the mansion . This she also opened and locked again when they had entered . She then conducted the Resurrection Man up the staircase , and finally into her boudoir . Guiding him to a chair , she released him from the silk cap ; but when it was removed , he could perceive nothing — for the room was quite dark . "
839684	839688	839701	839701	she	37668	" whispered Adeline : "
839776	839777	839782	839782	ma'am	26745	" "
839784	839788	839782	839782	ma'am	26745	" returned Tidkins . "
839809	840012	839802	839802	my	0	" Adeline then guided him behind the curtain of her bed ; and she herself took her post near the door . And now succeeded a most appalling interval of nearly twenty minutes,—appalling only to Adeline ; for her hardened accomplice was thinking far more of the additional sum he was about to earn , than of the deed he was hired to perpetrate . But , Adeline — oh , her thoughts were terrible in the extreme ! Not that she dreaded the failure of the deadly plot , and a consequent exposure of the whole machination:—no — her plans were too well laid to admit that contingency . But she felt her mind harrowing up , as it were , at the blackness of the tragedy which was in preparation . Twenty minutes , we said , elapsed:—twenty years of mental agony — twenty thousand of acute suffering , did that interval appear to be . At length a step echoed in the corridor;—nearer and nearer it came . Good God ! what pangs lacerated the heart of Lady Ravensworth;—and even then — far as she had gone — she was on the point of rushing forward , and crying , "
840020	840029	839802	839802	my	0	" But some demon whispered in her ear , "
840035	840168	840169	840169	Wretch	1062	vengeance!"—and she retained her post — she stifled the better feelings that had agitated within her — she nerved herself to be merciless and unrelenting . She knew that the step approaching was that of Lydia ; for Lydia allowed none of the other servants to enter her mistress 's own private chamber . The reason of this must be obvious to the reader:—Lydia only repaired thither for the sake of appearances — and not to do the work which it was her duty to perform . No — that had been left for Adeline herself to execute ! And now the handle of the lock was agitated — the door opened — and Lydia , bearing a light , entered the room . Instantly Adeline closed the door violently — exclaiming , "
840176	840352	840171	840171	your	1062	" Lydia started — and dropped the light . But in another second the Resurrection Man , springing like a tiger from his lair , rushed upon her from behind the curtain — seized her throat with his iron grasp — and threw her on the floor as easily as if she were a child . The light had gone out — and the fearful deed was consummated in the dark . A low gurgling — a suffocating sound — and the convulsions of a body in the agony of death were the terrible indications to Adeline that the work was indeed in awful progress ! Faint and sick at heart — with whirling brain — and bright sparks flashing from her eyes — Lady Ravensworth leant against the door for support . Two minutes thus elapsed — the gurgling sound every instant growing fainter and fainter . Adeline felt as if her own senses were leaving her — as if she were going mad . Suddenly a low , hoarse voice near her whispered , "
840358	840390	840391	840391	We	22401	" Then Lady Ravensworth was suddenly recalled to the consciousness of her perilous position,—awakened to the necessity of carrying out all her pre - arranged measures of precaution to the end . "
840399	840410	840411	840411	You	22402	" she said , in a low and hurried tone . "
840457	840636	840793	840793	God	880	" The Resurrection Man clutched the gold eagerly:—the weight was sufficient to convince him that his patroness was not deceiving him . While he was hugging his ill - earned gains , Adeline hastily felt her way to the bureau , opened it , and took forth her casket of jewels . She left the door of the bureau open , and the key in the lock . The Resurrection Man now suffered her to replace the silk cap over his head:—what would he not have done for one who paid so liberally ! Then , taking the body upon his back , he was led by Adeline from the boudoir . They descended the stairs , and passed out of the mansion by the private door , which Adeline closed but left the key in the lock . She conducted him through the grounds once more , leaving the wicket open — and proceeded across a field , in one corner of which was a large deep pond . A pile of stones was near the brink . "
840644	840791	840793	840793	God	880	" said Adeline . The Resurrection Man obeyed , and seated himself quietly by it . Adeline averted her eyes from the pale countenance , on which a faint stream of straggling moonlight stole through the darkness of the night;—and rapidly did she busy herself to secure her casket of rich jewels and several huge stones about the corpse . This she did by means of a strong cord , with which she had provided herself ; for — fearful woman!—she had not omitted one single detail of her horrible plan — nor did she hesitate to sacrifice her precious casket to aid in the assurance of her own safety . When this labour was finished,—and it did not occupy many minutes,—Adeline rolled the body down the precipitous bank into the pond . There was a splash — a gurgling sound ; and all was still . "
840795	840801	840793	840793	God	880	" murmured the Resurrection Man ; "
840820	840862	840818	840818	her	22404	" The words did not , however , reach the ears of Lady Ravensworth,—or she would have recoiled with abhorrence from that fearful admiration which she had excited in the mind of such a miscreant — a resurrectionist — a murderer ! "
840869	840877	840818	840818	her	22404	" said Adeline , breathing more freely . "
840882	840976	840818	840818	her	22404	" She led her companion across the fields:—her delicate feet were wet with the dew;—and though she felt wearied — oh ! so wearied that she was ready to sink,—yet that woman — within a few weeks of becoming a mother — was armed with an almost superhuman energy , now that it was too late to retreat and her enemy was no more . When they reached the cab , the driver was sleeping on his box ; and before he was well awake , the Resurrection Man had entered the vehicle . "
840988	841085	840982	840982	you	22406	" said Adeline , as she followed Tidkins into the cab . And now she was journeying side by side with one who had just perpetrated a cold - blooded murder,—she the promptress — he the instrument ! In three quarters of an hour they again stopped at the corner of the Edgeware Road , Adeline having removed the cap from the Resurrection Man 's head a few minutes previously . The cab was dismissed:—Tidkins had vainly looked to discover its number . Adeline , by bribing the driver , had provided against that contingency also ! "
841092	841096	841090	841090	ma'am	26745	" said Tidkins , "
841112	841113	841098	841098	you	26745	" "
841118	841122	841098	841098	you	26745	" interrupted Adeline . "
841126	841133	841144	841144	her	22410	" And she hastened rapidly away . "
841146	841154	841098	841098	you	26745	" murmured the Resurrection Man to himself : "
841162	841393	841155	841155	she	22410	" He then pursued his way homewards , well contented with his night 's work . And Adeline regained admittance to her town - mansion , having so well contrived matters that the housekeeper never suspected she had once quitted it during the day or night . Between three and four o'clock in the morning the rain began to pour down in torrents , and continued until past eight,—so that Lady Ravensworth was enabled to assure herself with the conviction that even the very footsteps of herself and Anthony Tidkins were effaced from the grounds belonging to the Hall , and from the fields in one of which was the pond to whose depths the corpse of the murdered victim had been consigned . Scarcely had Lady Ravensworth risen from the table , whereon stood the untasted morning meal , when the housekeeper of the town - mansion entered the room , and informed her mistress that Quentin had just arrived on horseback from the Hall , and requested an immediate audience of her ladyship . Adeline was not unprepared for some such circumstance as this ; she however affected to believe that the sudden appearance of Quentin in town bore reference to the illness of her husband ; and when the valet entered the apartment , she hastened to meet him , exclaiming , with well - assumed anxiety , "
841409	841410	841405	841405	Quentin	1704	" "
841425	841426	841432	841432	Quentin	1704	" "
841434	841447	841432	841432	Quentin	1704	" cried Adeline , as if tortured by acute suspense and apprehension . "
841458	841462	841448	841449	My lord	27330	" returned Quentin : "
841491	841492	841493	841493	Lydia	1544	" "
841496	841501	841493	841493	Lydia	1544	" exclaimed Lady Ravensworth . "

841559	841564	841565	841565	Lydia	1544	" ejaculated the valet . "
841576	841577	841565	841565	Lydia	1544	" "
841582	841590	841565	841565	Lydia	1544	" cried Adeline , feigning deep indignation . "
841608	841609	841601	841601	I	0	" "
841625	841629	841601	841601	I	0	" observed Quentin . "
841643	841648	841638	841638	you	1704	" demanded Lady Ravensworth . "
841897	841898	841855	841855	Lydia	1544	" "
841908	841926	841855	841855	Lydia	1544	" demanded Adeline , whose plan had succeeded in all its details precisely as she had foreseen . "
841949	841953	841941	841941	I	0	" answered Quentin . "
842071	842072	842060	842063	the other female servants	22445	" "
842084	842088	842060	842063	the other female servants	22445	" exclaimed Adeline : "
842095	842096	842091	842091	she	1544	" "
842111	842122	842097	842097	They	22446	" answered Quentin , with a little embarrassment of manner . "
842130	842203	842125	842125	I	0	" said Adeline , blushing deeply — for she guessed the cause of the valet 's hesitation : he was evidently impressed with the idea that his mistress had possessed herself of those keys to favor her supposed amour with Colonel Cholmondeley . But she willingly incurred even this suspicion , because , by apparently accounting for the keys being in her room , it made the evidence stronger against Lydia Hutchinson . "
842213	842222	842205	842206	his lordship	3013	" inquired Adeline , after a short pause . "
842231	842235	842223	842223	I	0	" answered Quentin ; "
842276	842352	842355	842355	Quentin	1704	" Lady Ravensworth suffered the valet to reach the door ere she called him back ; for nothing was more opposed to her plan than the idea of giving any notoriety to the transaction , inasmuch as such a course might afford Anthony Tidkins a clue to the entire mystery of the transaction in which he had played so important a part . Accordingly , as if impelled by a second thought , she said , "
842364	842365	842355	842355	Quentin	1704	" "
842371	842379	842355	842355	Quentin	1704	" cried the valet , in astonishment . "
842388	842393	842380	842380	I	0	" was the answer . "
842420	842428	842433	842433	my	0	" ejaculated Quentin , his surprise increasing . "
842440	842444	842433	842433	my	0	" she continued . "
842535	842536	842532	842533	Lady Bounce	1723	" "
842545	842555	842537	842538	Your ladyship	6346	" said the obsequious valet , with a bow . "
842568	842569	842537	842538	Your ladyship	6346	" "
842584	842588	842580	842580	myself	0	" answered Adeline ; "
842599	843152	842590	842590	you	22461	" Quentin retired , well persuaded in his own mind that the leniency of his mistress was caused by her fears lest the presumed fact of the keys of the private door and the wicket having been kept in her room might lead to inquiries calculated to bring to light her supposed amour with Colonel Cholmondeley . Thus was it that one of the engines of Lydia 's vengeance,—namely , the trick by which she had induced the Colonel to enter her mistress 's boudoir , and the fact of making the other servants privy to that visit,—now materially served the purposes of Adeline . In a quarter of an hour the carriage was ready ; and Lady Ravensworth was soon on her way back to the Hall . On her arrival , she found that the circumstance of Lydia Hutchinson 's disappearance had yielded in interest to one of a more grave and absorbing character . Lord Ravensworth was dying ! She hastened to his apartment , and found him lying in bed — in a state of complete insensibility — and attended by Mr. Graham , who had sent off an express to town ( by a shorter way than the main road by which Adeline had returned ) for eminent medical assistance . It appeared that about an hour previously the nobleman 's bell had rung violently ; and when the servants hurried to the room , they found their master in a fit . He had probably felt himself suddenly attacked with an alarming symptom , and staggered from his chair to the bell - rope , and had then fallen upon the floor . Mr. Graham had been immediately summoned ; and by his orders Lord Ravensworth was conveyed to bed . But he had continued insensible — with his eyes closed ; and the only sign of life was given by his faint , low breathing . It is scarcely necessary to state that Mr. Graham exerted all his skill on behalf of the dying man . Adeline affected the deepest sorrow at the condition in which she found her husband;—but the only grief which she really experienced was caused by the prospect of being shortly compelled to resign all control over the broad lands of Ravensworth , in case her as yet unborn child should prove a daughter . In the course of the day two eminent physicians arrived from London ; but the condition of Lord Ravensworth was hopeless : nothing could arouse him from the torpor in which he was plunged ; and in the evening he breathed his last . Thus was it that this nobleman had at length accomplished — involuntarily accomplished — his self - destruction by the use of the oriental tobacco sent to him by his brother Gilbert Vernon ! On the first day of February there had been a marriage at Ravensworth Hall : on the sixteenth there was a funeral . How closely does mourning follow upon the heels of rejoicing , in this world ! On the same night when Lord Ravensworth breathed his last , the following scene occurred in London . It was about eleven o'clock when the Resurrection Man and Mr. Banks entered the cell in which the old woman was confined . "
843158	843178	843154	843154	your	22466	" demanded Tidkins , in a surly tone , as if he expected a farther delay in the business . "
843183	843189	843179	843179	God	880	" returned the foul hag ; "
843194	843278	843179	843179	God	880	" And she pointed to several sheets of paper , written upon in a hand which showed that the harridan had been no contemptible pen - woman in her younger days . The Resurrection Man greedily seized the manuscript , and began to scrutinise each consecutive page . As he read , his countenance displayed grim signs of satisfaction ; and when , at the expiration of a quarter of an hour , he consigned the papers to his pocket , he said , "
843292	843293	843283	843283	I	0	" "
843304	843314	843299	843299	her	22467	" observed Mr. Banks , shaking his head solemnly ; "
843373	843374	843404	843405	old woman	37392	" "
843379	843396	843404	843405	old woman	37392	" cried Tidkins : then , counting down ten sovereigns upon the table , he said , "
843445	843446	843438	843438	you	22467	" "
843457	843625	843449	843449	I	0	" muttered the hag , as she wrapped the sovereigns in a morsel of paper , and concealed them under her clothes . The Resurrection Man now proceeded to blindfold her carefully ; and the operation reminded him of the process to which he had submitted on the preceding night , at the hands of his veiled patroness . He next helped the old woman to put on her cloak , the hood of which he threw over her bonnet so that a portion of it concealed her face ; and Banks then led her away from the subterranean , while Tidkins remained behind them for a few moments to secure the doors . The party now proceeded , by the most unfrequented streets , through Globe Town into Bethnal Green ; but it was not until they reached Shoreditch , that the Resurrection Man removed the bandage from the old hag 's eyes . Then she gazed rapidly around her , to ascertain where she was . "
843646	843657	843628	843628	you	22473	" said the Resurrection Man , with a low chuckle . "
843671	843730	843663	843663	she	22474	" remarked Banks . The worthy trio then pursued their way to Golden Lane . On their arrival at the court , the hag uttered an exclamation of delight when she beheld the filthy place of her abode once more : but her joy was suddenly changed into sadness as a thought struck her ; and she exclaimed , "
843747	843976	843663	843663	she	22474	" She alluded to the juvenile prostitutes whom she had tutored in the ways of vice . Heaving a deep sigh at the reflection , she took a key from her pocket , and opened the door of her house . A little delay occurred in obtaining a light ; but at length she found a candle and matches in a cupboard at the end of the passage . Mr. Banks now officiously opened the door of the old woman 's parlour ; but this act was followed by a sweeping , rustling noise — and the undertaker started back , uttering a yell of agony . The hag screamed too , and nearly dropped the light ; for her large black cat had flown at Banks as he entered the room . The fact was that the poor animal had been left in that apartment , when the old woman first set out with the Resurrection Man and the undertaker for Hounslow ; and it had gone mad through starvation . Tidkins rushed forward the moment his friend gave vent to that scream of anguish , and caught the cat by the neck and hind legs with his powerful fingers , as it clung , furious with rage , to the breast of the undertaker , whose dingy shirt frill and front its claws tore to rags . "
843986	844010	843663	843663	she	22474	" cried the hag , with unfeigned anxiety — for the only thing she loved in the world was her huge black cat . "
844017	844021	843663	843663	she	22474	" exclaimed Tidkins : "
844032	844054	844055	844055	They	22479	" And in spite of the violent pressure he maintained with his fingers upon its throat , the animal struggled fearfully . "
844064	844094	844055	844055	They	22479	" observed Mr. Banks , dolefully , as he beheld the tattered state of his linen and smarted with the pain of the cat 's scratches upon his chest . "
844103	844109	844100	844100	I	0	" again screamed the hag : "
844124	844125	844100	844100	I	0	" "
844131	844159	844100	844100	I	0	" said the Resurrection Man , coolly , as he literally wrung the cat 's neck : then he tossed the carcass from him upon the stairs . "
844163	844169	844160	844161	Poor thing	26694	" murmured the old woman : "
844186	844211	844173	844173	I	0	" And she actually wiped away a tear,—she who felt no pity , no compunction , no sympathy in favour of a human soul ! "
844220	844230	844218	844218	she	22482	" muttered Banks , endeavouring to smooth his linen : "
844238	844293	844235	844235	I	0	" The trio then entered the parlour : but before she could compose herself to attend to business , the old hag was compelled to have recourse to her gin ; and fortunately there was some in her bottle . Her two companions refreshed themselves in a similar manner ; and Tidkins then said , "
844307	844308	844235	844235	I	0	" "
844320	844325	844315	844315	I	0	" cried the hag ; "
844352	844471	844346	844346	you	22483	" The old woman spoke more confidently now ; for she felt herself to be less in the power of her two companions than she so lately was . The Resurrection Man understood her , and smiled grimly , as he counted the money before her . She then took a pair of scissors , cut a small hole in the mattress of her bed , and drew forth a pocket - book , which she handed to Tidkins . It was tied round with a piece of riband — once pink , now faded to a dingy white ; and its contents were several letters . The Resurrection Man glanced over their superscriptions , muttering to himself , "
844591	845604	844583	844583	I	0	" With a complacent smile — as complacent as a smile on such a countenance could be — the Resurrection Man secured the pocket - book with its contents about his person . He and Banks then took their leave of the old woman . It was on a beautiful morning , in the first week of March , that a large war - steamer passed Gravesend , and pursued its rapid way towards Woolwich . She was a splendid vessel , rigged as a frigate , and carrying twelve carronades . Her hull was entirely black , save in respect to the gilding of her figurehead and of her stern - windows ; but her interior was fitted up in a style of costly magnificence . Large mirrors , chaste carving , rich carpets , and soft ottomans gave to the chief cabin the air of a princely drawing - room . On the deck every thing denoted the nicest order and discipline . The sailors performed their duties with that alacrity and skill which ever characterise men - of - war 's men who are commanded by experienced officers ; and two marines , with shouldered firelocks , paced the quarter - deck with measured steps . The white sails were all neatly furled ; for the gallant vessel was now progressing by the aid of that grand power which has achieved such marvellous changes on the face of the earth . The tall chimney sent forth a volume of black smoke ; and the bosom of the mighty river was agitated into high and foam - crested billows by the play of the vast paddle - wheels . From the summit of the main - mast floated the royal standard of Castelcicala . And on the deck , in the uniform of a general officer , and with a star upon his breast , stood the Marquis of Estella , conversing with his aides - de - camp . At a short distance was Morcar — in plain , private clothes . Richard was now returning to his native shore — occupying in the world a far more exalted position than , in his wildest imaginings , he could ever have hoped to attain . He had left England as an obscure individual — a subordinate in a chivalrous expedition — under the authority of others:—he came back with a star upon his breast — having achieved for himself a renown which placed him amongst the greatest warriors of the age ! Unmarked by title , unknown to fame , was he when he had bade adieu to the white cliffs of Albion a few months previously:—as the Regent of a country liberated by himself — as a Marquis who had acquired nobility by his own great deeds , did he now welcome his native clime once more . Tears of joy stood in his eyes — emotions of ineffable bliss arose in his bosom , as he thought of what he had been , and what he now was . But vanity was not the feeling thus gratified : at the same time , to assert that our hero was not proud of the glorious elevation which he had reached by his own merits , would be to deny him the possession of that laudable ambition which is an honour to those who entertain it . There is , however , a vast distinction between vanity and a proper pride : the former is a weakness — the latter the element of moral strength . Yes : Richard was proud — but not unduly so — of the honours which were now associated with his name;—proud , because he had dashed aside every barrier that had once seemed insuperable between the Princess and himself . And , oh ! he was happy , too — supremely happy ; for he knew that when he landed at Woolwich he should behold her whom we have before declared to be the only joy of his heart — the charming and well - beloved Isabella ! The gallant steamer pursued its way : Erith is passed;—and soon Woolwich is in sight . And now the cannon roars from the English arsenal : the volumes of white smoke sweep over the bosom of the Thames;—the artillery salutes the royal standard of Castelcicala . The troops are drawn up in front of the barracks to do honour to their heroic fellow - countryman , who retains his almost sovereign rank until the moment when he shall resign it into the hands of that Prince on whose brow he has come to place a diadem . It is low water ; and the Castelcicalan steamer drops her anchor at some little distance from the wharf . Then , under a salute from the cannon of the gallant vessel , the Marquis of Estella descends into a barge which has been sent from the arsenal to waft him ashore . But while he is still at a distance from the wharf his quick eye discerns well - known forms standing near the spot where he is to land . There are the Grand - Duke Alberto and the Grand - Duchess , attended by the commandant of Woolwich and his staff ; and leaning on her father 's arm , is also the Princess Isabella . The Grand - Duke is in plain clothes : he has come as it were incognito , and as a friend , to receive him to whom he is indebted for that throne which awaits him ; and he is moreover anxious that all the honours proffered on this occasion shall be acknowledged by him who still bears the rank of Regent of Castelcicala . The barge touches the steps : Richard leaps ashore . He hurries up the stairs — he stands upon the wharf ; and , while the guard of honour of British soldiers presents arms , he is affectionately embraced by the Grand - Duke . "
845612	845631	845632	845632	I	0	" exclaimed Alberto , straining him to his breast , as if he were a dearly beloved son . "
845655	845675	845679	845679	you	22491	" replied Markham , whose heart was so full that he could with difficulty give utterance to those words . "
845683	845690	845679	845679	you	22491	" cried the Grand - Duke . "
845709	845745	845749	845749	Richard	874	" And , as he thus spoke , Alberto placed the hand of our hero in that of the beauteous Isabella , while the Grand - Duchess said in a voice tremulous with joyful emotion , "
845757	846163	845751	845751	you	874	" Markham thanked the parents of his beloved with a rapid but expressive glance of the deepest gratitude ; and he and Isabella exchanged looks of ineffable tenderness , as they pressed each other 's hand in deep silence — for their hearts were too full to allow their lips to utter a syllable . But those looks — how eloquent were they ! They spoke of hopes long entertained — often dim and overclouded — but never completely abandoned — and now realized at last ! To appreciate duly the sweets of life , we should have frequently tasted its bitters ; for it is by the influence of contrast , that the extent of either can be fully understood . Those who have been prosperous in their loves,—who have met with no objections at the hands of parents , and who have not been compelled to wrestle against adverse circumstances,—are incapable of understanding the amount of that bliss which was now experienced by Richard and Isabella . It was indeed a reward — an adequate recompense for all the fears they had entertained , the sighs they had heaved , and the tears they had shed on account of each other ! And we ourselves , reader , pen these lines with heart - felt pleasure ; for there are times — and the present occasion is one — when we have almost fancied that our hero and heroine were real , living characters , whom we had seen often and known well;—and we are vain enough to hope that this feeling has not been confined to our own breast . Yes — we can picture to ourselves , with all its enthusiasm , that delightful scene when the handsome young man,—handsomer than ever in the uniform which denoted his high rank,—exchanged those glances of ineffable tenderness and devoted love with the charming Italian maiden,—more charming than ever with the light of bliss that shone in her eyes , made her sweet bosom heave , and brought to her cheeks a carnation glow beneath the faint tint of bistre which denoted her southern origin without marring the transparency of her pure complexion . And now , the first delights of this meeting over , Richard presented his aides - de - camp to the illustrious family ; then , beckoning Morcar towards him , he took the gipsy by the hand , saying , "
846194	846195	846200	846203	the sovereign of Castelcicala	22497	" "
846205	846219	846200	846203	the sovereign of Castelcicala	22497	" returned the Grand - Duke , shaking Morcar warmly by the hand , "
846228	846229	846200	846203	the sovereign of Castelcicala	22497	" "
846237	846248	846230	846232	Your Serene Highness	41683	" said Morcar , in a firm but deferential manner , "
846289	846306	846283	846283	he	1395	" continued Morcar , looking at Richard and dashing away a tear at the same time ; "
846378	846379	846365	846365	they	22503	" "
846393	846413	846365	846365	they	22503	" exclaimed the Duke , struck by the extreme modesty and propriety of the Zingaree 's words and manner . "
846422	846423	846416	846416	I	0	" "
846431	846443	846428	846428	your	0	" answered Morcar , in the same respectful but firm tone as before,—"nothing
846491	846501	846485	846485	he	22505	" continued the gipsy , once more looking affectionately towards Markham;—"and
846527	846584	846587	846588	a wife	26722	" Having thus spoken , Morcar wrung the hand of our hero with a fraternal warmth , and was about to hurry away,—leaving all his hearers deeply affected at the words which he had uttered,—when Isabella stepped forward , caught him gently by the arm , and said in her sweet musical voice , now so tremulously clear,—"But
846624	846644	846647	846647	lady	8723	" Thus speaking , the Princess unfastened a gold chain from her neck , and forced it upon Morcar . "
846649	846654	846647	846647	lady	8723	" said the gipsy , "
846678	846690	846691	846691	she	1365	" he added , sinking his voice almost to a whisper , "
846717	846824	846691	846691	she	1365	" With these words , Morcar hurried away — hastened down the steps , leapt into a wherry , and directed the rowers to push the boat instantly from the wharf . When it was some yards distant , Morcar turned his head towards the group upon the quay , and waved his hand in token of adieu;—and every member of that group returned his salutation with gestures that expressed the kindest feelings towards him . The party now proceeded to the residence of the commandant , where a splendid déjeuner was served up . Richard sate next to his Isabella , and was supremely happy . "
846833	846839	846830	846830	I	0	" he whispered to her , "
847019	847020	847021	847021	I	0	" "
847033	847037	847060	847060	Richard	874	" answered Isabella , "
847069	847070	847058	847058	I	0	" "
847077	847082	847058	847058	I	0	" whispered our hero , "
847118	847119	847100	847100	I	0	" "
847155	847160	847141	847141	I	0	" said the Princess . "
847243	847244	847260	847260	they	22526	" "
847254	847258	847260	847260	they	22526	" answered Richard , "
847271	847355	847260	847260	they	22526	" A domestic now entered and stated that the carriages were in readiness ; and the illustrious party , having taken leave of the commandant and officers of the garrison , proceeded to the mansion at Richmond . Alberto and Richard Markham were then closeted for some time together . Our hero presented his Highness with the official despatches from the Ministers announcing his proclamation as Grand - Duke , and inviting him to return to Castelcicala to take possession of the throne . "
847365	847376	847356	847356	Your	37529	" said Richard , when these documents had been perused , "
847496	847497	847498	847498	I	0	" "
847512	847519	847498	847498	I	0	" replied the Grand - Duke : "

847633	847640	847630	847631	my lord	27330	" cried Markham , somewhat uneasily . "
847660	847668	847650	847650	I	0	" answered the Duke with a smile . "
847709	847710	847699	847699	Isabella	1329	" "
847726	847745	847748	847748	Richard	874	" exclaimed Richard , falling upon his knees , and pressing the sovereign 's hand to his lips . "
847752	847759	847748	847748	Richard	874	" said the Grand - Duke : "
847829	847830	847826	847827	my daughter	29175	" "
847842	847847	847839	847839	her	29175	" replied our hero . "
847877	847878	847863	847863	I	0	" "
847896	847903	847906	847906	Richard:—the	1771	" exclaimed the Grand - Duke . "
847918	847919	847920	847920	Your	874	" "
847926	847933	847920	847920	Your	874	" continued Richard , thus encouraged , "
848085	848093	848094	848094	Your	22556	" added Richard , with a sigh . "
848110	848130	848094	848095	Your Highness	36939	" The Grand - Duke reflected profoundly for some minutes ; and Richard awaited his answer with intense anxiety . "
848143	848149	848134	848134	your	22556	" at length cried Alberto : "
848186	848187	848174	848174	I	0	" "
848202	848205	848206	848206	Isabella	1329	" said Richard "
848233	848234	848217	848217	God	880	" "
848253	848261	848240	848240	you	0	" returned Alberto , with a smile . "
848299	848300	848301	848301	I	0	" "
848310	848312	848301	848301	I	0	" answered Richard,—"that
848360	848361	848377	848377	you	0	" "
848366	848373	848377	848377	you	0	" interrupted the Grand - Duke . "
848385	848391	848377	848377	you	0	" he added , smiling , "
848403	848404	848377	848377	you	0	" "
848418	848419	848377	848377	you	0	" "
848434	848442	848420	848420	You	0	" again interrupted the Duke , laughing . "
848491	848498	848513	848513	you	0	" added his Serene Highness significantly , "
848516	848517	848518	848518	Your	0	" "
848527	848636	848637	848637	Isabella	1329	" exclaimed Richard , again pressing the Duke 's hand to his lips . Alberto then rang the bell , and commanded the domestic who answered the summons to request the presence of the Grand - Duchess and the Princess . Those illustrious ladies soon made their appearance — Isabella 's heart fluttering with a kind of joyful suspense , for she full well divined at least one topic that had been discussed during the private interview of her father and her lover . The two latter rose as the ladies entered the room . Then the Grand - Duke took his daughter 's hand , and said , "
848766	848791	848732	848732	himself	22578	" continued the Grand - Duke , drawing himself up to his full height , while a glow of honourable pride animated his countenance , "
848920	849160	849161	849161	He	22584	" With these words the Grand - Duke took from the table a paper which he presented to our hero , who received it on his bended knee . He then rose : Alberto placed the hand of Isabella in his ; and the young lovers flew into each other 's arms . The parents exchanged glances of unfeigned satisfaction as they witnessed the happiness of their charming daughter and of him whom she loved so faithfully and so well . Dinner was shortly announced ; and around the table were smiling faces gathered that evening . At nine o'clock Richard took his departure alone in the Grand - Duke 's carriage ; for he had transferred his own aides - de - camp to the service of their sovereign . But when he bade farewell to Isabella on this occasion , it was with the certainty of seeing each other again in a short time ; and they inwardly thanked heaven that their meeting was no longer clandestine , and that their attachment was at length sanctioned by the parents of the charming maiden . On the same evening Mr. Monroe , Ellen , and Katharine were assembled in the drawing - room at Markham Place . The lamp burnt bright , and there were books open upon the table ; but none of the little party had any inclination to read:—some event of importance was evidently expected . "
849168	849181	849161	849161	He	22584	" observed Mr. Monroe , after a long pause in the conversation . "
849203	849204	849207	849207	he	22584	" "
849230	849234	849207	849207	he	22584	" said Ellen , "
849248	849249	849207	849207	he	22584	" "
849252	849347	849207	849207	he	22584	" exclaimed Mr. Monroe ; and he walked to the window , whence he looked forth into the bright clear night . It is a strange fact that whenever people are expecting the arrival of some one near or dear to them , they invariably go to the windows , where they watch with a sort of nervous agitation — as if by so doing they could hasten the coming which they anticipate . The two young ladies drew close to each other on the sofa , and exchanged a few words in whispers . "
849357	849361	849348	849348	You	22589	" said Ellen ; "
849400	849401	849402	849402	I	0	" "
849412	849419	849410	849410	Ellen	1117	" answered Kate , blushing deeply , "
849463	849464	849447	849447	you	0	" "
849487	849491	849472	849472	he	1300	" interrupted Ellen . "
849524	849546	849472	849472	he	1300	" Katherine was about to reply , when Mr. Monroe , who was still watching at the window , suddenly exclaimed , "
849553	849835	849472	849472	he	1300	" The two young ladies hurried to the casement , and beheld the lamps of the vehicle rapidly approaching , while the sound of its wheels also reached their ears . Then they both hastened from the room , followed by Mr. Monroe , to receive Markham the moment he should alight . Whittingham and Marian joined them ; and the whole party was stationed on the steps of the front door when the carriage drove up . In another moment Richard was amongst them ; and there were such congratulations — such shaking of hands — and such proofs of joy as were seldom known or seen even on occasions of similar happiness . As for the old butler , he was literally mad with the excitement of his feelings . He hugged his young master with a warmth that could not possibly have been exceeded had they stood in the relation of father and son , and the fervour of which considerably deranged the position of our hero 's epaulettes and aiguillettes — for he was in his uniform , as the reader will remember . Then , when Whittingham had thus far testified his joy at his master 's return , he seized upon Marian and compelled her to perform three or four rapid pirouettes with him in the hall — to the infinite peril of that good woman 's equilibrium . She disengaged herself from him with considerable difficulty ; and the old man , quite overcome by his feelings and performances , sate down in one of the hall - chairs , and began to whimper like a child — exclaiming as well as he could , "
849858	849865	849866	849867	Master Richard	874	" and he slapped his breast . "
849901	849902	849893	849893	Marlborough	1092	" "
849911	849922	849904	849904	yourself	22597	" said the young Prince , pressing Whittingham 's hand : "
849942	849972	849923	849923	I	0	" The footman who attended upon the Grand - Duke 's carriage now approached our hero , and with head uncovered , said in a tone of extreme deference , "
849991	849992	849993	849993	I	0	" "
850003	850007	849993	849993	I	0	" answered Richard ; "
850019	850038	850039	850040	The Prince	6244	" The footman bowed , and retreating to the hall - steps , cried aloud to the coachman , "
850046	850047	850039	850040	The Prince	6244	" "
850054	850072	850073	850073	I	0	" ejaculated Whittingham , who , together with the others present , had caught those swelling titles . "
850088	850089	850073	850073	I	0	" "
850117	850129	850134	850134	I	0	" answered Richard , laughing at his old dependant 's bewilderment : "
850159	850189	850192	850193	Master Richard	874	" The butler seemed to reflect profoundly for a few moments , with his eyes fixed on the marble floor then , suddenly raising his head , he exclaimed , "
850322	850362	850314	850315	his Highness	8564	" Having issued these commands in a tone of pompous importance which the old man had not adopted for some years past , he seized a candle and led the way in a solemn and dignified manner up stairs . "
850377	850402	850314	850315	his Highness	8564	" whispered Richard , laughing , to Ellen and Katharine , as he placed himself between them , and gave them each an arm . "
850425	850524	850314	850315	his Highness	8564	" The reader will not require us to detail all the conversation which ensued . Markham had so much to tell , and his hearers so much to learn , that the time slipped away with lightning speed . Our hero not only related at length all that had occurred to him in Italy , but also entered upon explanations which he had never broached before relative to his attachment to Isabella . He made Whittingham sit down and listen to all he had to say ; and he concluded by acquainting those present with his intended marriage . "
850527	850533	850314	850315	his Highness	8564	" he hastened to add , "
850616	850619	850636	850636	my	0	friend,"—addressing himself to Whittingham,—"preside
850623	850624	850625	850625	I	0	" "
850639	850689	850691	850691	Whittingham	881	" said the butler , with an air of considerable importance . Ellen 's countenance had suddenly become thoughtful , when she heard that Richard was so shortly to be married . Leaning towards him , as she sate by his side , she murmured in a hasty whisper , "
850708	850748	850704	850705	my father	2156	" Markham requested the old man to see that the servants of the Grand - Duke were well cared for ; and Whittingham accordingly withdrew . Richard then glanced inquiringly towards Ellen , who rose and whispered to Katherine , "
850778	850789	850768	850769	my father	2156	" Kate cheerfully complied with this request , and retired . "
850797	850806	850795	850795	Ellen	1774	" inquired Richard with some degree of anxiety . "
850822	850823	850795	850795	Ellen	1774	" "
850832	850836	850827	850827	yourself	874	" said Ellen . "
850922	850923	850924	850924	Ellen	1774	" "
850939	850962	850927	850927	Isabella	1329	" began Richard , deeply affected by these words , which recalled so many unpleasant reminiscences with respect to Monroe 's daughter . "
850969	850988	850966	850966	me	0	" continued Ellen , with a sweet smile of gratitude for the sentiment which Markham had half expressed : "
851106	851107	851100	851100	father	3167	" "
851110	851117	851100	851100	father	3167	" repeated our hero , joyfully . "
851125	851130	851100	851100	father	3167	" cried Mr. Monroe : "
851152	851168	851100	851100	father	3167	" And he pressed her to his heart with the warmest enthusiasm of paternal affection . "
851171	851180	851100	851100	father	3167	" continued Ellen , after a short pause , "
851310	851311	851313	851313	you	22642	" "
851317	851321	851313	851313	you	22642	" exclaimed Markham : "
851391	851392	851386	851389	a very dear sister	22647	" "
851408	851416	851403	851403	you	22642	" exclaimed Ellen , emphatically and joyfully ; "
851471	851484	851450	851450	you	22642	" continued Ellen , casting down her eyes , and blushing deeply . "
851520	851521	851522	851522	I	0	" "
851531	851536	851529	851529	Ellen	1774	" exclaimed Mr. Monroe . "
851573	851574	851575	851576	Your father	2203	" "
851588	851592	851581	851581	I	0	" said Richard : "
851655	851656	851657	851657	Father	940	" "
851661	851673	851674	851674	you	940	" murmured Ellen , pressing their hands affectionately in her own , "
851689	851722	851681	851681	you	940	" And as tears of joy stood in her large melting blue eyes , and her face and neck were suffused in blushes , how beautiful did she appear — sweet Ellen ! "
851733	851742	851723	851723	You	940	" said Markham , after a short pause . "
851752	851756	851744	851744	I	0	" answered Ellen ; "
851768	851769	851758	851758	she	44791	" "
851804	851808	851795	851795	you	940	" observed Richard . "
851824	851844	851795	851795	you	940	" replied Ellen . She then hurried from the room , and in a short time returned with Katherine . "
851860	851877	851853	851853	your	940	" said Ellen , as the young ladies seated themselves side by side upon the sofa . "
851885	851888	851890	851890	I	0	" began Katherine "
852282	852303	852304	852304	I	0	" Kate wiped away the tears that had started into her eyes as she thus alluded to her maternal parent . "
852310	852318	852304	852304	I	0	" she continued , after a pause , "
852470	852471	852454	852454	I	0	" "
852487	852491	852454	852454	I	0	" observed Richard ; "
852512	852513	852514	852514	I	0	" "
852563	852564	852543	852543	He	1300	" "
852569	852573	852566	852567	that friend	10694	" said Markham , "
852625	852626	852608	852608	he	2092	" "
852634	852638	852639	852639	I	0	" observed Katherine , "
852738	852739	852740	852740	I	0	" "
852746	852750	852751	852751	Tidkins	998	" exclaimed Richard . "
852803	852804	852806	852806	my	0	" "
852812	852816	852817	852817	I	0	" continued Katherine , "
852916	852917	852918	852918	You	22700	" "
852925	852929	852918	852918	You	22700	" said Richard ; "
853114	853681	853704	853704	him	22707	" Katherine expressed her gratitude to our hero for this additional proof of his kindness towards her . The happy party remained in conversation until a late hour — unconscious of the rapid lapse of time , so deeply were they interested in the various topics of their discourse . It was , indeed , nearly two o'clock in the morning when the last light was extinguished in Markham Place . Nevertheless , the inmates of that happy dwelling rose at an early hour — for there was much to be done that day , and little time for the purpose . Ellen and Mr. Monroe repaired to town the moment breakfast was over , to make a variety of purchases in order to render the mansion as complete in all its arrangements as possible for the reception of the bride . Money is endowed with a wondrously electric power to make tradesmen bustling and active ; and in spite of the little leisure left for choice and selection , the business - habits of Mr. Monroe and the good taste of his daughter enabled them to accomplish their task in a manner satisfactory to all concerned . Thus , in the afternoon , waggons piled with new and costly furniture , carts laden with chinaware and glass , and others containing carpets , curtains , and handsome hangings for the windows , were on their way to Markham Place . And at the mansion , in the meantime , all was bustle and activity . Richard had departed early in the Grand - Duke 's carriage for Richmond ; but Katherine superintended all the domestic arrangements ; Marian obtained the assistance of two or three char - women in her special department ; and Whittingham forthwith added to the establishment , upon his own responsibility , two footmen and a page , all of whom were well known to him and happened to have been out of place at the moment . Thus , by the time the young Prince returned home to dinner at five o'clock , the old mansion exhibited an appearance so changed , but withal so gay and tastefully handsome , that he was unsparing in his praises of those who had exhibited so much zeal in rendering it fit to receive his bride on the following day . The happy morning dawned . The weather was mild and beautiful ; the sky was of a cloudless azure ; and all nature seemed to smile with the gladness of an early spring . Markham rose at seven o'clock , and dressed himself in plain clothes ; but upon his breast he wore the star which denoted his princely rank . And never had he appeared so handsome;—no — not even when , with the flash of his first triumph upon his cheeks , he had entered the town of Estella and received the congratulations of the inhabitants . When he descended to the breakfast - room , he found Mr. Monroe , Ellen , and Katherine already assembled : they too were attired in a manner which showed that they were not to be omitted from the bridal party . At eight o'clock the Grand - Duke 's carriage drove up to the door ; and in a few minutes our hero and his friends were on their way to Richmond . "
853684	853690	853704	853704	him	22707	" thought Ellen to herself ; "
853719	853927	853930	853930	you	22710	" The carriage rolled rapidly along ; and as the clock struck nine it dashed up the avenue to the door of the now royal dwelling . Richard and his companions were ushered into the drawing - room , where the Grand - Duke and the Duchess , with the aides - de - camp , and a few select guests , were awaiting their arrival . The reception which Mr. Monroe , Ellen , and Katherine experienced at the hands of the royal pair was of a most cordial kind , and proved how favourably our hero had spoken of them . In a short time Isabella made her appearance , attended by her bridemaids — the two daughters of an English peer . Richard hastened to present his friends to the Princess ; and the cordiality of the parents underwent no contrast on the part of the daughter;—but if she were more courteous — nay , kind — in her manner to either , that preference was shown towards Ellen . And it struck the young lady that such slight preference was evinced towards her ; for she turned a quick but rapid glance of profound gratitude upon Richard , as much as to say , "
853938	854563	853930	853930	you	22710	" How lovely did Isabella seem — robed in virgin white , and her cheeks suffused with blushes ! There was a charm of ineffable sweetness — a halo of innocence about her , which fascinated the beholder even more than the splendour of her beauty . As she cast down her eyes , and the long slightly - curling black fringes reposed upon her cheeks , there was an air of purest chastity in her appearance which showed how nearly allied her heart was to the guilelessness of angels . And then her loveliness of person — Oh ! that was of a nature so ravishing , so enchanting , as to inspire something more than mere admiration — something nearer resembling a worship . Poets have compared eyes to stars — teeth to ivory — lips to coral — bosoms to snow;—they have likened symmetry of form to that of sylphs , and lightness of step to that of fairies;—but poor , poor indeed are all similitudes which we might call to our aid to convey an idea of the beauty of this charming Italian maiden , now arrayed in her bridal vestment ! The ceremony was twofold , Richard being a Protestant and Isabella a Roman Catholic . A clergyman of the Church of England therefore united them , in the first instance , by special licence , at the Grand - Duke 's mansion . The bridal party immediately afterwards entered the carriages , which were in readiness , and repaired to the Roman Catholic chapel at Hammersmith , where the hands of the young couple were joined anew according to the ritual of that creed . And now the most exalted of Richard 's earthly hopes were attained;—the only means by which his happiness could be ensured , and a veil drawn over the sorrows of the past , were accomplished . When he looked back to the period of his first acquaintance with Isabella,—remembered how ridiculously insignificant was once the chance that his love for her would ever terminate in aught save disappointment,—and then followed up all the incidents which had gradually smoothed down the difficulties that arose in his path until the happy moment when he knelt by her side at the altar of God,—he was lost in astonishment at the inscrutable ways of that Providence which had thus brought to a successful issue an aspiration that at first wore the appearance of a wild and delusive dream ! On the return of the bridal party to the mansion near Richmond , a splendid banquet was served up ; and if there were a sentiment of melancholy which stole upon the happiness of any present , it was on the part of Isabella and her parents at the idea of separation . At length the déjeuner is over ; and Isabella retires with her mother and bridemaids to prepare for her departure . The Grand - Duke takes that opportunity to thrust a sealed packet into our hero 's hand . A few minutes elapse — Isabella returns — the farewells take place — and the bridegroom conducts his charming bride to the carriage . Mr. Monroe , Ellen , and Katherine follow in a second chariot . It was four o'clock in the afternoon when Richard assisted his lovely young wife to alight at the door of his own mansion ; and now Markham Place becomes the residence of the Prince and Princess of Montoni . Vain were it to attempt to describe the delight of the old butler when he beheld his master bring home that beauteous , blushing bride ; and — as he said in the course of the day to Mr. Monroe , "
854654	854663	854646	854646	I	0	" he added , in a mysterious whisper , "
854679	854778	854779	854779	You	0	" It was eleven o'clock that night when Ellen cautiously issued from the back door of the mansion . She passed rapidly through the garden , passed out of the gate , and hastily ascended the hill on whose summit were the two trees . A man was seated on the bench . Ellen approached him , threw her arms round his neck , and embraced him with a tenderness that even appeared to surprise him by its warmth . She placed herself by his side ; he drew her towards him — and kissed her almost affectionately . "
854784	854795	854779	854779	You	0	" said Ellen , in a plaintive and anxious tone . "
854821	854822	854813	854813	your	0	" "
854830	854843	854813	854813	your	0	" replied Greenwood , without answering her question in a direct way , "
854858	854859	854845	854845	you	0	" "
854868	854879	854862	854862	I	0	" she asked , in a tone tremulous with joy . "
854886	854922	854923	854923	you	0	" exclaimed Greenwood , speaking nevertheless in a manner which seemed to indicate that he was giving way to a feeling of weakness which he could not conquer , but of which he was ashamed ; "
854948	854949	854942	854943	some one	27192	" "
854957	854967	854942	854943	some one	27192	" cried Ellen , pressing her lips to his . "
855034	855035	855036	855036	You	0	" "
855044	855064	855042	855042	Ellen	1774	" said Greenwood , upon whose lash a tear stood : but he hastily dashed it away , exclaiming , "
855123	855124	855111	855111	I	0	" "
855127	855138	855111	855111	I	0	" cried Ellen , the tears streaming from her eyes : "
855167	855176	855191	855191	he	0	" she continued , pointing towards the mansion ; "
855325	855326	855318	855318	his	0	" "
855336	855342	855318	855318	his	0	" exclaimed Greenwood , impatiently . "
855359	855360	855353	855353	you	22727	" "
855372	855379	855353	855353	you	22727	" cried Ellen , in alarm : "
855536	855537	855501	855501	me	0	" "
855544	855551	855542	855542	Ellen	1774	" cried Greenwood , almost furiously : "
855667	855668	855670	855670	you	1774	" "
855685	855686	855670	855670	you	1774	" "
855698	855704	855696	855696	Ellen	1774	" added Greenwood , hastily . "
855724	855725	855696	855696	Ellen	1774	" "
855733	855746	855696	855696	Ellen	1774	" cried Ellen , as a sudden reminiscence shot through her brain , "
855773	855774	855757	855757	you	1774	" "
855789	855793	855787	855787	Ellen	1774	" said Greenwood , hastily;—"but
855798	855803	855804	855804	I	0	" he added mournfully . "
855856	855857	855824	855824	Richard	874	" "
855864	855871	855824	855824	Richard	874	" asked Ellen , somewhat reproachfully . "
855887	855888	855889	855889	I	0	" "
855896	855904	855892	855892	I	0	" returned Greenwood , with renewed impetuosity . "
856053	856054	856047	856047	Ellen:—I	1779	" "
856061	856070	856047	856047	Ellen:—I	1779	" said Ellen , again embracing her husband : "
856083	856084	856085	856085	I	0	" "
856094	856098	856089	856089	I	0	" continued Greenwood : "
856138	856139	856121	856121	I	0	" "
856148	856152	856121	856121	I	0	" said Ellen ; "
856157	856166	856121	856121	I	0	" she added , glancing towards the trees . "
856172	856173	856192	856192	Ellen	1774	" "
856194	856195	856192	856192	Ellen	1774	" "
856202	856256	856257	856257	I	0	" They embraced , and separated — Ellen retracing her steps towards the mansion , and Greenwood remaining on the hill . On the following morning , after breakfast , Richard conducted his lovely bride over the grounds belonging to the Place ; and when they had inspected the gardens , he said , "
856297	856369	856370	856370	Eugene	879	" They ascended the eminence : they stood between the two trees . But scarcely had Richard cast a glance towards the one planted by the hand of Eugene , when he started , and dropped Isabella 's arm . She threw a look of intense alarm on his countenance ; but her fears were immediately succeeded by delight when she beheld the unfeigned joy that was depicted on his features . "
856386	856390	856395	856395	he	879	" exclaimed Richard . "
856404	856441	856395	856395	he	879	" The Princess now observed the inscriptions upon the tree . They stood thus : — Eugene . Dec. 25 , 1836 . Eugene . May 17th , 1838 . Eugene . March 6 , 1841 . "
856447	856451	856442	856442	Eugene	879	" said Richard . "
856514	856650	856651	856651	My	0	" Isabella partook of her husband 's joy ; and after lingering for some time upon the spot , they retraced their steps to the mansion . The carriage was already at the door : they entered it ; and Richard commanded the coachman to drive to Woolwich . On their arrival at the wharf where Richard had landed only two days previously , they found a barge waiting to convey them on board the Castelcicalan steamer . The Grand - Duke and Grand - Duchess , with their suite , received them upon the deck of the vessel . The hour of separation had come : Alberto and his illustrious spouse were about to return to their native land to ascend a throne . The Grand - Duke drew Richard aside , and said , "
856677	856678	856657	856657	your	22750	" "
856697	856701	856702	856702	My	0	" answered Markham . "
856734	856735	856711	856711	he	2172	" "
856747	856754	856711	856711	he	2172	" said the Grand - Duke ; "
856769	856770	856771	856771	Your	22750	" "
856787	856791	856792	856792	You	22750	" exclaimed Markham . "
856938	856939	856935	856936	Thomas Armstrong	882	" "
856957	856987	856935	856936	Thomas Armstrong	882	" said the Grand - Duke ; then , by way of cutting short our hero 's remonstrances in respect to the annual revenue , his Serene Highness exclaimed , "
856998	857719	856935	856936	Thomas Armstrong	882	" We shall not dwell upon the parting scene . Suffice it to say that the grief of the daughter in separating from her parents was attempered by the conviction that she remained behind with an affectionate and well - beloved husband ; and the parents sorrowed the less at losing their daughter , because they knew full well that she was united to one possessed of every qualification to ensure her felicity . And now the anchor was weighed ; the steam hissed through the waste - valves as if impatient of delay ; and the young couple descended the ship 's side into the barge . The boat was pushed off — and the huge wheels of the steamer began to revolve on their axis , ploughing up the deep water . The cannon of the arsenal thundered forth a parting salute in honour of the sovereign and his illustrious spouse who were returning to their native land from a long exile . The ship returned the compliment with its artillery , as it now sped rapidly along . And the last waving of the Grand - Duchess 's handkerchief , and the last farewell gesture on the part of the Grand - Duke met the eyes of Isabella and Richard during an interval when the wind had swept away the smoke of the cannon . The Prince and Princess of Montoni landed at the wharf , re - entered their carriage , and were soon on their way back to Markham Place . The evening appointed by Katherine , in her note to Mr. Banks , for the purchase of the papers relating to her birth , had now arrived . It was nearly eight o'clock . The undertaker was at work in his shop , the door of which stood open ; and several idle vagabonds were standing near the entrance , watching the progress that was made in bringing a new coffin to completion . Somehow or another , people always do stop at the doors of undertakers ' workshops — doubtless actuated by feelings of the same morbid nature as those which call crowds of faces to the windows in a street along which a funeral is passing . Mr. Banks had laid aside his coat , and appeared in his dingy shirt sleeves : he wore a paper cap upon his head ; and a long apron was tied very high up above his waist — reaching , indeed , almost to the waistcoat pockets . As the gas was not laid on in his establishment , he was working by the light of a couple of tallow candles , that flickered in a most tantalising manner with the draught from the open door — leaving Mr. Banks every other minute in a state of exciting suspense as to whether they were about to be extinguished or to revive again . Still he did not choose to adopt the very natural precaution of closing the shop - door , because he considered it business - like to have a group of idlers collected at the entrance . And there was an air of business about Mr. Banks 's establishment . There were shining white coffin - plates hanging along one row of panes in the window ; and black japanned ones suspended along another row . At a central pane hung a miniature coffin - lid , covered with black cloth , and studded with nails in the usual manner . The shop itself was crowded with coffins , in different stages towards completion : the floor was ankle deep in shavings and sawdust ; and carpenters ' tools of all kinds lay scattered about . But , pre - eminently conspicuous amongst all those objects , was a glass - case standing upon a little shelf , and enclosing that very miniature model of the patent coffin which he had displayed at the farm - house near Hounslow . Mr. Banks was busily employed in fitting a lid to a coffin which stood upon trestles in the middle of the shop ; and his two eldest boys , one fifteen and the other thirteen , were occupied , the first in planing a board , and the second in sawing a plank . "
857722	857736	857737	857737	I	0	" mused Mr. Banks to himself , as he proceeded with his work , "
857920	857962	858042	858042	I	0	" And , as if deeply impressed by this conviction , the undertaker shook his head solemnly . He then continued his employment for some time without musing upon any one topic in particular . At length he broke silence altogether . "
857967	858008	857965	857965	Ned	1152	" said he to his eldest - born ( he had five or six smaller specimens of the Banks ' breed indoors ) , as he raised his head from his work , and looked severely round towards the lad ; "
858047	858054	858042	858042	I	0	" added Mr. Banks , sternly . "
858076	858081	858068	858068	they	22775	" returned the youth ; "
858094	858095	858068	858068	they	22775	" "
858139	858144	858135	858135	his	22778	" responded Mr. Banks . "
858160	858161	858164	858164	you	0	" "
858171	858176	858164	858164	you	0	" cried the boy , "
858206	858207	858164	858164	you	0	" "
858233	858245	858214	858226	the blessed carkiss that 'll rejice in such a lid as that board	22785	" said Banks , sweeping his horny palm over the plank . "
858256	858257	858214	858226	the blessed carkiss that 'll rejice in such a lid as that board	22785	" "
858268	858275	858262	858266	a fool and a humbug	22786	" returned the lad , sulkily : "
858286	858287	858279	858279	I	0	" "
858297	858306	858279	858279	I	0	" cried Banks , assuming a threatening attitude . "
858313	858318	858279	858279	I	0	" added his son . "
858326	858391	858392	858392	Brayvo	1580	" said Mr. Banks , coolly , as he dealt his heir a tremendous box on the ear , which forced the young man nearly over the plank that had caused the dispute ; but as the lad was not quite floored , his father bestowed on him a kick which , speedily succeeding the slap , levelled the youthful coffin - maker altogether . "
858394	858446	858392	858392	Brayvo	1580	" shouted the idlers at the door . The discomfited son of Mr. Banks got up , retreated to the farther end of the shop , and was about to discharge a volley of insolence at his father when a gentleman and lady suddenly appeared on the threshold of the shop . "
858452	858457	858449	858450	Miss Wilmot	1413	" exclaimed Mr. Banks : "
858469	858493	858467	858467	sir	26649	" he added , turning towards Kate 's companion , whom he did not know personally , but who was really Richard Markham . "
858504	858529	858502	858502	sir	26649	" Then , without farther ceremony , the undertaker banged the door violently in the faces of the loungers at the shop - entrance . "
858536	858546	858502	858502	sir	26649	" he said , again turning to his visitors . "
858684	858731	858672	858678	the poor sinful wessels in this neighbourhood	22800	" Thus talking , and shaking his head in a most solemn manner , Mr. Banks led the way to a parlour behind the shop : and when his two visitors had entered it , he closed the door to prevent the intrusion of his sons . "
858744	858765	858742	858742	sir	26649	" said the undertaker , doing the honours of his abode with all the politeness of which he was master . "
858806	858807	858797	858797	Mr.—Mr.—ahem!—I	22807	" "
858816	858820	858797	858797	Mr.—Mr.—ahem!—I	22807	" said Richard . "
858850	858872	858873	858873	Sir	26649	" And as he spoke , our hero coolly produced a brace of pistols , which he laid upon the table . "
858884	858897	858873	858873	Sir	26649	" stammered the undertaker , turning pale , and recoiling in alarm . "
858901	858905	858873	858873	Sir	26649	" said Markham : "
858965	858970	858946	858946	you	27067	" he added emphatically , "
858976	858977	858946	858946	you	27067	" "
858992	858996	858988	858988	her	1413	" said Banks , "
859033	859034	859021	859021	I	0	" "
859045	859055	859043	859043	sir	26649	" returned our hero , in an authoritative tone . "
859082	859083	859087	859087	sir	26649	" "
859097	859104	859087	859087	sir	26649	" said Banks , still hesitating ; "
859110	859111	859087	859087	sir	26649	" "
859121	859125	859087	859087	sir	26649	" added Markham . "
859137	859167	859127	859127	I	0	" Thus speaking , he drew forth a pocket - book , and , opening it , displayed to the undertaker 's eager eyes a number of Bank notes . "
859175	859179	859127	859127	I	0	" murmured Banks ; "
859221	859222	859197	859197	you	27067	" "
859233	859240	859242	859242	you	1300	" said Markham , somewhat sternly ; "
859285	859286	859287	859287	I	0	" "
859296	859342	859292	859292	I	0	" returned the undertaker . With these words , he slowly unlocked an old walnut - wood desk , which stood in a recess ; and thence he took a brown - paper parcel , tied round with coarse string and sealed in several places . "
859356	859381	859347	859347	I	0	" he said , leisurely advancing towards the table : then , taking a seat , he handed the parcel to Markham , observing , "
859465	859505	859452	859452	he	26696	" While Banks was thus indulging his garrulity , Markham had opened the parcel by the aid of a pair of scissors which lay upon the table ; and the first thing which struck him was a letter addressed to "
859512	859586	859506	859507	Mr. Markham	874	" Katherine , who watched him attentively , without , however , looking at the papers herself , observed him start as if with sudden surprise : then he tore open the letter with almost a wild precipitation , and glanced rapidly over the contents . As he read , his countenance became flushed , and his features expressed mingled joy and astonishment — joy the most fervent , astonishment the most profound . "
859590	859606	859506	859507	Mr. Markham	874	" he exclaimed , throwing down the letter , ere he had fully perused it : "
859633	859634	859635	859636	Your sister	6636	" "
859640	859657	859635	859636	Your sister	6636	" murmured the young maiden , as she sank almost fainting upon her brother 's breast . "
859667	859673	859660	859661	my sister	27063	sister!"—and he embraced her tenderly . "
859732	859733	859727	859727	you	1413	" "
859748	859759	859736	859736	Richard	874	" exclaimed Katherine , weeping through varied but ineffable emotions . "
859777	859778	859779	859779	I	0	" "
859793	859797	859785	859785	I	0	" returned Markham . "
859818	859826	859828	859828	I	0	" And again he embraced her tenderly . "
859841	859845	859828	859828	I	0	" murmured Katherine : "
859857	859858	859828	859828	I	0	" "
859864	859868	859828	859828	I	0	" said Richard ; "
859889	859890	859892	859892	you	22847	" "
859906	859930	859933	859933	they	22849	" observed Mr. Banks , wiping his eyes with the limp ends of his cravat , as if deeply affected by the scene . "
859984	859985	859950	859950	I	0	" "
859995	860023	859993	859993	sir	26649	" exclaimed Richard , with whom the undertaker 's remarks passed unheeded , so absorbed were his thoughts in the signal discovery which he had just made . "
860043	860044	860037	860037	You	22847	" "
860059	860071	860047	860047	I	0	" said Banks , grasping the treasure now handed to him ; "
860102	860116	860128	860128	my	0	" continued the undertaker , as he scrutinised the notes one by one . "
860183	860215	860222	860225	this pretty young lady	22859	" And Mr. Banks proceeded to lock up the pocket - book , with its valuable contents , in his desk . Richard and Katherine rose , as if to depart . "
860233	860243	860222	860225	this pretty young lady	22859	" said Mr. Banks , attempting a pleasant smile . "
860267	860268	860219	860219	your	27330	" "
860272	860384	860385	860385	his	0	" returned Markham , throwing a sovereign upon the table . Katherine looked at her brother in astonishment ; but he affected not to perceive the impression which his strange conduct had thus created . Banks seemed overjoyed at the affability of the nobleman ; and gathering up the piece of gold , the change out of which he already considered as his own perquisite , he hastened to execute the commission;—but not without trying the lid of the desk ere he left the room , to convince himself that it was securely locked . He passed through the shop , which was empty ; and , muttering to himself something about "
860401	860430	860385	860385	his	0	" opened the street door and went out . The moment he was gone , Richard seized his pistols , and saying in a hurried tone to Katharine , "
860442	860496	860385	860385	his	0	" hastened from the room by a door leading to the inner part of the dwelling . He rushed down a passage , and entered the yard — as if well acquainted with the undertaker 's premises . The moment he set foot in the yard , he whistled in a peculiar manner . "
860499	860513	860385	860385	his	0	" cried a man , darting forward from the corner near the window . "
860520	860533	860534	860534	Fool	27204	" exclaimed Markham , advancing towards him , and presenting a pistol . "
860536	860632	860534	860534	Fool	27204	" said the man ; and he threw himself with desperate fury upon our hero . But Richard , maintaining his footing gallantly , closed with his assailant , and threw him to the ground , his pistol going off with the shock — without , however , inflicting any injury . And at the same moment three police - officers leapt over the wall , in time to put an end to the struggle between Markham and his opponent , the latter of whom they made their prisoner and immediately bound with strong cords . "
860638	860645	860648	860648	Benstead	1454	" asked one of the officers . "
860650	860655	860648	860648	Benstead	1454	" was the reply : "
860673	860766	860668	860669	the prisoner	2889	" The whole transaction,—from the moment when Richard left the undertaker 's parlour to that when he re - entered it , followed by the policemen with the captive,—had not occupied two minutes . He found Katherine reclining back in her chair — half fainting and paralysed by terror , so deeply had the report of the pistol and the concomitant scuffle in the yard alarmed her . But the moment she heard her brother 's voice , she started up , gazed wildly around , and threw herself into his arms . "
860782	860793	860796	860797	dear sister	22864	" she exclaimed , terror still depicted on her countenance . "
860804	860808	860799	860799	I	0	" exclaimed Richard . "
860840	860965	860975	860977	a cussed fool	22871	" Katherine turned a rapid glance towards the group on the other side of the room , and beheld the sinister and ferocious countenance of the individual whom she had seen in the company of the old hag near Bennet 's farm . At this moment the door communicating with the shop opened , and Mr. Banks made his appearance , carrying a bottle in his hand . He started back in astonishment and alarm when his eyes encountered the police - officers , with his friend Anthony Tidkins securely bound in the midst of them . But as his glances wandered from one to another , he suddenly appeared to recollect something ; and , fixing his eyes on Benstead , he exclaimed , "
861057	861118	861043	861044	the gen'lemen	22878	" added Mr. Banks , with a smirking countenance . This semi - pleasantry on his part was only assumed ; for his own life had not been so immaculate as to preclude the existence of certain fears when he found himself in the dangerous vicinity of the police . He was , however , speedily reassured on this head . "
861125	861129	861120	861120	your	22874	" exclaimed Markham , "
861152	861157	861175	861175	you	22874	man,"—pointing with deep disgust towards Tidkins,—"you
861295	861312	861313	861313	I	0	" he added , addressing these words to the undertaker , but glancing affectionately towards Katherine . "
861323	861337	861313	861313	I	0	" said Banks , shaking in every limb with vague fears and suspicions . "
861381	861410	861313	861313	I	0	" Richard turned his back contemptuously upon Mr. Banks , and , addressing himself to Benstead , asked where he intended to lodge the prisoner for the night . "
861432	861437	861438	861438	He	22885	" was the reply . "
861489	861680	861681	861681	I	0	" Markham promised compliance with this request . A cab was sent for ; and the Resurrection Man , who had maintained a moody silence , although he never ceased from looking vindictively upon our hero , from the moment he was arrested , was now removed in safe custody . The Prince then conducted Katherine to the carriage that was waiting for them in another street ; and shortly after ten o'clock they reached Markham Place . We shall pass over all elaborate details of the surprise and joy with which Isabella , Ellen , and Mr. Monroe received the intelligence that Katherine was our hero 's sister,—his sister without what the world calls the stigma of illegitimacy ! Suffice it to say , that the discovery produced the most unfeigned pleasure in the breasts of all , and that Kate became the object of the sincerest congratulations . Richard then related as succinctly as possible,—for he longed to peruse the precious documents in his possession,—the capture of the Resurrection Man and the scheme by which he had placed that villain in the hands of the officers of justice .

861890	861956	861957	861957	I	0	" The members of that happy party drew round the table ; and Richard began by reading the various letters that accompanied the old woman 's narrative . But as those epistles merely corroborated the main points of her tale , we shall not quote them . The narrative itself will explain all ; and that important document may be found in the ensuing chapter . "
862035	862553	862554	862554	I	0	" At that epoch I kept a boarding - house — a fashionable boarding - house , in a fashionable street at the West End . I was not then ugly and withered as I am now : I had the remains of great beauty — for I was very beautiful when young ! I was also of pleasant and agreeable manners , and knew well how to do the honours of a table . You will not therefore be surprised when I tell you that I was a great favourite with the persons who lodged at my establishment , and with the still more numerous visitors . It is true that this establishment was a boarding - house ; and it was conducted to all outward appearances , in a most respectable manner . But it had its interior mysteries as well as many other dwellings in this metropolis . The fact is , that I was well known to a large circle of nobles and gentlemen who employed all their leisure time in intrigues and amours . Having been gay myself from fifteen to forty , I was deeply versed in the various modes of entrapping respectable young persons , and even ladies , in the meshes artfully spread to ensure a constant supply of new victims to the lust of those men of pleasure . Having changed my name and thrown a veil as it were over the past , I opened the boarding - house by means of the funds supplied by my patrons , and soon experienced great success . By paying all my tradesmen with the utmost punctuality , I acquired a good character in the neighbourhood ; for your tradesmen can always make or mar you , their shops being the scandal - marts where all reports , favourable or unfavourable , are put into circulation ; and as they consider that those who pay well must necessarily be respectable , regularity on that point is certain to ensure their advantageous opinion . Having thus founded the respectability of my establishment , the rest was easy enough . The calculations made by myself and patrons were these:—Boarding - houses are usually inhabited by ladies possessing incomes which , though derived from sources that are sure , are too small to enable them to set up in housekeeping for themselves . Elderly widows with their daughters,—young widows who , coming from the country or from abroad , are strangers in London , but who wish to marry again , and therefore seek that society which is most easily entered,—friendless orphans who possess small annuities,—aunts and their nieces,—grandmothers with their grand - daughters,—these are the class of ladies who principally support boarding - houses . Thus there is always a large proportion of young ladies in those establishments ; and out of a dozen there are sure to be three or four very good - looking . There can now be no difficulty in understanding the motives which induced my patrons to place me at the head of a boarding - house . "
862852	863038	863039	863039	I	0	" The lodgers in boarding - houses are always mean and avaricious . The smallness of their incomes does not permit them to indulge largely in their natural taste for dress ; and yet nowhere do females maintain such desperate struggles to appear fine in their apparel . Thus the ladies in boarding - houses can easily be persuaded to accept of presents ; and of these my patrons were by no means sparing . A gold chain was a certain passport to a young lady 's favour ; and a velvet or silk dress would secure the good opinion of the aunt or grandmamma , and even of the mamma . Moreover , when one of my patrons appeared particularly attentive to any young lady , she concluded of course that his intentions were honourable ; and in a very short time she became his victim . In a word , my boarding - house , though ostensibly so respectable , was nothing more nor less than a brothel conducted with regard to outward decencies , and carefully hushing up scandals that occurred within . "
863297	863453	863291	863291	I	0	" My plan was to instil into Harriet 's mind elevated notions of the position which she ought to reach through the medium of her personal attractions . I told her of great lords who had fallen in love with females in obscure stations , and who had married them ; and as I also supplied Harriet with clothes , I took good care that they should be of such a nature as was calculated to engender ideas of finery . But all my arts failed to corrupt the pure mind of Miss Wilmot : she listened to me with respect — never with interest;—she wore the garments that I gave her , because she had none others . I saw that it was no use to think of introducing the Marquis to her immediately ; and such was the passion he had conceived for her , that he did not become lukewarm with delay . "
863875	864056	863858	863858	I	0	" Harriet Wilmot thus entered my service . But the very same day that she came into my house , I was attacked with a sudden and malignant fever , which threw me upon a sick bed . For ten days I was insensible to all that was passing around me ; and when I awoke from that mental darkness , I found Harriet by my bed - side . For ten days and ten nights had she watched near me , scarcely snatching a few moments ' repose in the arm - chair . She was pale and wan with long vigils ; but how her beautiful countenance lighted up with the animation of joy , when the physician declared that I should recover . And this same physician assured me that I owed my life more to the care of the faithful Harriet than to his skill . I was overwhelmed by this demonstration of so much gratitude on her part ; and I determined to place her beyond the reach of danger the moment I was convalescent . "
864422	864451	864452	864452	Harriet	1432	" I must observe that all these incidents,—from the first moment of my acquaintance with Harriet until she thus quitted my house,—occurred within a period of three months . "
864693	864786	864787	864788	Mr. Markham	874	" This gentleman was Mr. Markham , of Markham Place . I never was in the neighbourhood of that mansion until about a year ago ; then I saw it for the first time , and I sighed as I thought of Harriet Wilmot ! For she ought to have become the mistress of the spacious dwelling;—and so she doubtless would have become , had not my treachery blighted all her hopes — all her prospects ! But I must go back to resume the thread of my history in due course . "
864874	865151	864865	864865	I	0	" It was about three months after the birth of Katherine that I met Harriet one day in the street ; and she seemed to me more beautiful than ever . She had written to announce to me that she was married , but without saying to whom , nor indicating where she lived . When I thus encountered her , holding her babe in her arms , she invited me to her lodgings , for she said , ' My husband will not be offended with me for communicating all the particulars of my happiness to you ; since you were the only friend I found in the time of my poverty and , when my poor father was on his death - bed . Besides , ' she added , with a smile of infinite satisfaction , ' my husband is about to acknowledge me as his wife and take me to his own home . ' While we were yet speaking , the Marquis of Holmesford rode by on horseback ; and , as he turned to nod to me , he instantly recognised Harriet . She also knew him , and hurrying along with some alarm , entered her lodging , which was close by . I followed her : the incident which had disturbed her was soon forgotten ; and she then told me all the particulars of her first meeting and her subsequent marriage with Mr. Markham . And how she doted upon her child ! Never did I behold a mother so enthusiastic in her tenderness towards the offspring which she loved — and in which she felt pride ! "
865515	865914	865480	865481	The Marquis	17209	" I was now sorely perplexed : I no longer hesitated to obey the Marquis , because my own interests were concerned ; but I knew not what project to devise . At length , after having racked my brain for some short time , I hit upon a device which seemed to be the most feasible my ingenuity could suggest ; but I resolved to cultivate the intimacy of Harriet for nearly a week ere I put it into execution . I accordingly contrived to be almost constantly with her for the next five days , saving when she expected her husband . Of his coming she was usually made aware by letters from him : some of those epistles she read to me , in the ingenuous confidence of her pure soul ; and well might she rejoice in them — well might she treasure them,—for they were replete with tenderness and love . I know not exactly now what it was that prompted me to possess myself of some of those letters , in which Mr. Markham spoke of Harriet as his wife and the infant Katherine as his own child;—but I most probably thought that my knowledge of that secret union and its fruit might be turned to advantage , especially as I saw that a wealthy and well - born man was struggling with his pride whether to proclaim to the world his marriage with an obscure servant or whether he should continue to keep the affair secret . At all events I can not conceal the fact that I abstracted , during a temporary absence of Harriet from the room on one occasion when I called , three of the letters from her desk,—three epistles in which Mr. Markham alluded in the most unequivocal terms to his private marriage with Harriet and the existence of the fruit of that union . These letters were addressed simply ' Mrs. Wilmot , ' and without the mention of her abode on the envelope ; because , as I learnt from Harriet , Mr. Markham always sent them by a messenger from a tavern in Lower Holloway — never from his own house , nor by any one of his servants ; and by omitting the address , no clue could be afforded to impertinent curiosity should a letter thus sent happen to be lost . "
866077	866190	866075	866075	I	0	" When I took leave of her on the fifth evening she said to me , ' Mr. Markham will not be able to visit me at all to - morrow : you would afford me pleasure by dining with me and passing a long evening . '—The invitation exactly suited my purposes ; and I readily accepted it . But on the following day , instead of repairing to Harriet 's lodging at four o'clock , as promised , I went straight to Holmesford House . The Marquis was at home : he awaited my coming — for I had communicated my design to him by note on the preceding evening . "
866352	866529	866530	866530	I	0	" There was one room in Holmesford House which I must particularly describe . It was a bed - chamber — small , but furnished in the most sumptuous manner . It had no side windows ; but there was a sky - light on the roof ; and double sets of panes were fixed in the ample wood - work , with an interval of perhaps four inches between each pair . Thus no screams — no shrieks could penetrate beyond that strangely - contrived window : the double panes deadened every sound which transpired in that room . Similar precautions were adopted in respect to the other parts of the chamber . The doors were double , and covered with thick baize , so that they fixed tightly in their setting . The walls were also double , with a considerable interval between them : there was even a false floor half a foot above the proper one ; and carpets were spread so thickly that not even a footstep echoed in that chamber . "
866755	866993	866740	866740	Harriet	1432	" It was in the very depth of winter and consequently quite dark when Harriet reached Holmesford House . The lamps over the entrance had been purposely left unlighted ; and thus the poor young woman did not observe the vast exterior of the mansion to which she had come . But when the front door had closed behind her , and she found herself in the hall , she exhibited some alarm ; for , dimly as it was seen by the lustre of one faint lamp , she observed enough to convince her that she was in no common dwelling . The servant ( who had of course received her cue ) noticed the impression thus made upon her , and hastened to say something of a re - assuring nature . Thus , in a few minutes , Harriet was inveigled into the chamber which I have before described . ' Permit me to hold the baby , madam , ' said the servant ; ' your friend is ill in that bed . '—Harriet , doubtless bewildered at the strangeness of the whole proceeding , mechanically passed the child to the servant , and advanced towards the bed , the curtains of which were drawn around . She heard the doors close : she looked round — the servant had disappeared with the babe;—and Harriet was now alone with the Marquis of Holmesford ! "
867233	867414	867230	867231	Harriet Markham	1783	" Two hours elapsed , I say ; and at length the Marquis of Holmesford made his appearance . He was dreadfully frightened : his manner was wild and excited . I could not gather , from the expression of his countenance , whether he had triumphed or lost the victory to which he aspired over a virtuous and defenceless woman . I interrogated him with a gesture of impatience . ' Damnable woman ! ' he exclaimed ; ' if there were not such creatures as you , there would be less scope for the vices of men like me . Begone ! I would not endure another such scene — no , not were I offered a sovereign crown!'—I made some observation ; but he interrupted me fiercely , and commanded me to depart . I dared not disobey — his manner was actually terrific . He appeared as if he had just witnessed some horrible spectre , or had perpetrated a dreadful crime . I returned home ; and never did I pass such a miserable night . "
867852	868087	867829	867829	I	0	" The next evening came , and I had neither heard from the landlady , nor seen the Marquis . I sent a note to the latter ; but he had left town on the previous day . A thought struck me : could he have persuaded Harriet to accompany him ? Had he so far overcome the virtue of that pure - minded creature ? I thought of the packet from Mr. Markham , and longed to ascertain its contents . A strong suspicion lurked in my mind that it was connected with the affair in some way or another . I however waited a week ; and , hearing no tidings of any kind concerning Harriet , went boldly to her lodgings . ' Mrs. Wilmot 's disappearance is so strange , ' I said to the landlady , ' that , having consulted my legal adviser , and acting on the plea of being her intimate friend , I am determined to open that packet which was sent for her , and which I think must afford some clue to her absence . '—The landlady gave me the packet , saying , ' If you take the responsibility on yourself , well and good ; but I will have nothing to do with the business . '—This was better than I had even expected ; and I departed with the parcel . "
868353	868466	868467	868468	The Marquis	17209	" This terrible document bore no signature : but it was impossible , either by its nature or the handwriting , that it could have emanated from any one save Mr. Markham . The three letters accompanying it contained expressions of sincere gratitude and fervent affection towards Mr. Markham , and denoted three particular phases in Harriet 's connexion with him : namely , her assent to their union , the fact that she was in a way to become a mother , and the announcement of approaching maternity . I wept as I read them:—I wept as I thought of all I had done in accomplishing the ruin of poor Harriet ! "
868590	869020	868587	868588	Harriet Markham	1783	" I fell gradually lower and lower in the scale of my avocations ; but still I contrived to gain a living in various ways which have no connexion with the object of this narrative . It was about a year after the sad events above recorded , that I one day met Harriet Wilmot face to face in the neighbourhood of Bloomsbury . She was poorly clad and sickly in appearance ; and her countenance was expressive of profound mental dejection . She held a letter in her hand ; but she had not her child with her ; and she was hurrying rapidly along — most probably to the post - office . ' Harriet ! ' I exclaimed , catching her by the hand.—She started at being thus accosted ; but the moment her eyes fell on my countenance , she shuddered visibly , and cried out , ' You!'—then she darted away as if in affright , dropping the letter upon the pavement . For some moments I was so stupefied by her abrupt flight , that I stood as it were paralyzed . But seeing the letter upon the pavement , I recovered the use of my limbs , and hastened to pick it up . It was addressed ' To the Marquis of Holmesford , Holmesford House . ' I hurried away with it , saying to myself , ' Now I shall discover how far the connexion between Harriet and the Marquis went . '—But I was disappointed : the letter merely contained , as far as I can remember , these words:—'I ought not to address your lordship , under the peculiar — the distressing circumstances which made us acquainted ; but necessity compels me to appeal to your lordship 's bounty . It is not for myself , however , that I implore your aid ; but for the sake of my child , who is starving ! Oh ! my lord , if you only knew what the feelings of a mother are when she beholds her infant shrieking for food , and turning its eyes towards her countenance in so piteous a manner that they speak the language of famine far more eloquently than its tongue could possibly do , were it able to express its wants in words,—if you could understand these feelings , you would not think ill of me because I thus appeal to your bounty!'—An address was given in an obscure street in Bloomsbury ; and the letter was signed ' Harriet Wilmot . ' "
869284	869361	869252	869253	the woman	27628	" I went away , very miserable . I felt convinced that Harriet , when she perceived she had lost her letter , suspected that it might fall into my hands , and that I should thereby learn her place of abode . And it was clear that she had departed so abruptly to avoid me ! I have kept that letter — as well as all the others to which I refer in my history . "
869853	870234	869830	869830	she	1432	" Thus had I involuntarily driven her a second time from her humble home ! I was sorely afflicted , for many reasons — but chiefly because my motives were not on either occasion wrong . I was about to take my departure , when I thought I would cast a look at the interior of the chamber which she had inhabited . By its appearance I hoped to judge of her circumstances , which I sincerely wished might be improved . I entered the room : it was evidently a ready - furnished garret . I am able to recognise such facts at a glance . Though not absolutely wretched , it was mean — very mean — too mean to permit the idea that she , poor creature ! was comfortable in her resources . Several papers were burning in the grate : she had evidently set fire to them the moment ere she left the room in the precipitate manner described . I hastened to extinguish the smouldering flames , but redeemed the fragment of only one important paper . It contained the commencement of a letter evidently written that morning , as I discovered by the date . Strange to say , it was another epistle addressed ' To the Marquis of Holmesford , Holmesford House . ' Its contents were to this effect:—'Your lordship will pardon me for again intruding myself upon your notice ; but a deep sense of the duty I owe to my child , and the dread of leaving the poor innocent girl to the mercy of strangers — for the hand of Death seems to be already upon me — must serve as my excuse for thus troubling you . And when your lordship reflects that it is to you that I owe all the hideous misery which has been my lot for nearly four years,—through you that I lost the love and confidence of my husband,—your lordship 's heart will not allow this appeal to be made in vain . Hitherto your lordship has remained unacquainted with the name of that husband of whom I speak ; but now it is my duty to reveal it to you , that your lordship may see him and ex — — ' "
870326	870337	870323	870323	I	0	" From that time forth I never saw her more ! "
870397	870589	870390	870390	himself	17209	" My task is terminated : nor would I for worlds be compelled to accomplish it over again . It has given additional poignancy to thoughts that frequently oppress me , and has aroused others equally painful , but which had slumbered for years and years until now . And where I write — I dare not name the place , nor even those at whose command I write — there is a fearful gloom that is congenial , too congenial with those appalling reminiscences . Perhaps I should have felt and expressed less remorse for the past , had I written under more pleasant circumstances ; perhaps , in that case , many of those dread images which here haunt my mind and are reflected in the bewailings and self - reproaches which appear in these pages , would not have visited me : still , had I performed this task in a cheerful chamber and in the gladdening sun - light,—even then I must have felt some remorse — for of all the bad deeds of my life , the treachery which I perpetrated towards Harriet is the blackest ! "
870602	870873	870594	870594	Katharine	1413	" It was eleven o'clock on the following day , when the Marquis of Holmesford rose from the arms of one of the houris who formed his harem . He thrust his feet into a pair of red morocco slippers , put on an elegant dressing - gown of gay - coloured silk , and passed from the room of his charmer to his own chamber . There he entered a bath of warm milk ; and , while luxuriating in the tepid fluid which imparted temporary vigour to a frame enfeebled by age and dissipation , he partook of a bowl of the richest French soup , called consommée , which his valet presented on a massive silver salver . Having finished a broth that was well calculated to replenish the juices of his wasting frame , the hoary voluptuary left the bath , which was immediately wheeled into an adjacent chamber . Every morning was a certain quantity , consisting of many gallons , of new milk supplied for the use of the Marquis of Holmesford ; and when it had served him for one bath , it became the perquisite of his valet . And what did this domestic do with it ? Had he possessed hogs , he would not have given to those unclean beasts the fluid which had washed off all the impurities of his master 's person:—no — he would not have allowed the very pigs to partake of the milk with which the disgusting exudations of the old voluptuary 's body had commingled ! But he contracted with a milk - man whose "
870875	870909	871139	871139	my	0	" was in a very poor neighbourhood ; and that milk - man paid the valet a certain sum daily for the perquisite . It was then retailed to the poor as the best "
870916	871135	871136	871137	Mr. Greenwood	903	" Let us , however , return to the Marquis . Upon quitting his bath , he commenced the mysteries of the toilet,—that ceremony which involves so many repulsive details when connected with old men or old women who have recourse to cosmetics or succedaneous means to render less apparent the ravages of time and debauchery . Taking out his complete set of false teeth , he placed them in a glass filled with pure lavender water . His dressing - case supplied a silver instrument to scrape the white fur from a tongue that denoted the fever produced by the previous evening 's deep potations ; a pair of silver tweezers removed the hairs from his nostrils ; and , in the meantime , his wig , stretched upon a block , was skilfully dressed by the valet . It was past mid - day when Lord Holmesford quitted his chamber , looking as well as all the artificial means which he adopted towards the improvement of his person , and all the accessories of faultless clothes , whitest linen , and richest jewellery , could render an old worn - out beau of sixty - four . As he was descending the stairs , a servant met him , and said in a profoundly respectful tone , "
871149	871180	871136	871137	Mr. Greenwood	903	" The Marquis nodded his head , as much as to say that he heard the announcement , and proceeded to the apartment where the Member for Rottenborough was waiting . "
871188	871231	871183	871183	Greenwood	903	" cried the Marquis , affecting the sparkling hilarity of youth , and endeavouring to walk with a jaunty and easy air , just as if his old bones did not move heavily in their sockets like a door on rusty hinges ; "

871267	871283	871260	871261	Your lordship	28358	" said Greenwood , who had his own purposes to serve by flattering the nobleman ; "

871419	871452	871414	871414	you	903	" exclaimed the Marquis , highly delighted at the compliment thus conveyed — for with debauchees in fashionable life such a degrading assertion is a compliment , and a most welcome one , too:—"no

871486	871509	871510	871510	You	0	" cried Greenwood , gravely sustaining the familiar poke in the chest which his former compliment had elicited from the old nobleman . "

871558	871563	871550	871550	Dollabel	1784	" ejaculated the Marquis . "

872015	872071	872072	872072	Your	1785	" ejaculated Greenwood , nearly dying with laughter . The Marquis never for a moment suspected it to be all forced , but rubbed his hands together so briskly and chuckled so heartily , that a violent fit of coughing supervened , and he was compelled to turn aside to hold in his false teeth .

872346	872379	872380	872380	I	0	" interrupted the Marquis , rather peremptorily ; for he had entertained doubts of his friend 's prosperity for some time past ; and this application only tended to confirm his suspicions . "
872390	872406	872380	872380	I	0	" The dialogue was interrupted by the sudden entrance of a servant , who said , "
872421	872422	872410	872413	the Prince of Montoni	23151	" "
872430	872439	872423	872424	The Prince	6244	" exclaimed Greenwood , thrown off his guard . "
872446	872467	872423	872424	The Prince	6244	" said the Marquis , in the tone of a man who was surprised but not alarmed at this visit . "
872471	872483	872423	872424	The Prince	6244	" interrupted Greenwood , speaking in a hurried and thick tone , "
872524	872985	872506	872506	I	0	" And having uttered this hasty injunction , Greenwood passed into a back drawing - room , which was separated from the front one by folding - doors . But it was easy to overhear in the former apartment all that was said in the latter . Scarcely had the Member for Rottenborough thus retreated , when the Prince was ushered into the presence of the Marquis of Holmesford . Those two personages had never met before ; and the moment they thus found themselves face to face , they surveyed each other with rapid but scrutinising glances . On one side Richard Markham was naturally curious to behold the man,—the monster in human form,—who could have practised so much villany against so much virtue — who , in a word , had destroyed the happiness of the deceased and lamented mother of Katharine . On the other hand , the Marquis was struck by the handsome and noble appearance of that fine young man , who had raised himself from a sphere comparatively humble to an exalted position — who had led armies to a crowning triumph through the deadly strife of battle — and who was himself the personification of that generous spirit of political freedom which now influences the civilised world from the banks of the Thames to the waters of the Volga . And , oh ! what a contrast was formed in that splendid drawing - room where a great Prince and a wealthy peer now met for the first time:—the one possessing a heart beating with all the generous emotions that can redeem frail humanity from some of the dire consequences of the Primal Fall ; the other accustomed to sacrifice all and every thing to his own selfish lusts and degrading debaucheries:—the one endowed with that manly beauty which associates so well with the dignity of high rank and the aristocracy of virtue ; the other sinking beneath the infirmities of age and the ravages of dissipation:—the one noble alike by nature and by name ; the other noble only by name:—the one carrying his head erect , and well able to meet the glance of every eye that would seek to penetrate into the recesses of his soul ; the other conscious of having outraged so many hearts , that he quailed beneath the look of every visitor whose business was not immediately announced:—the one , in a word , the type of all that is great , good , chivalrous , and estimable ; the other a representative of a vicious hereditary aristocracy ! The Marquis requested our hero to be seated , and , having himself taken a chair , waited for an explanation of the motives of this visit . "
872995	872999	872986	872986	I	0	" said Richard , "
873043	873044	873045	873045	I	0	" "
873053	873058	873045	873045	I	0	" interrupted the nobleman ; "
873074	873075	873045	873045	I	0	" "
873089	873104	873105	873105	I	0	" continued Richard , bowing coldly in acknowledgment of the compliment thus paid him , "
873145	873146	873147	873147	Your	23157	" "
873165	873176	873177	873178	your Highness	36939	" exclaimed the Marquis , with evident signs of astonishment : "
873195	873196	873192	873192	strangers	2803	" "
873204	873213	873192	873192	strangers	2803	" said our hero , calmly but firmly : "
873408	873409	873410	873410	Your	23157	" "
873419	873428	873429	873429	I	0	" said the Marquis of Holmesford , warmly . "
873466	873467	873447	873447	I	0	" "
873472	873492	873447	873447	I	0	" cried Richard : then , as a sudden reminiscence struck him , he said in a musing tone , "
873531	873567	873568	873568	Harriet	1783	" Although the Prince uttered those words rather in a musing tone to himself than in direct address to the Marquis , the latter caught the name of Harriet , and instantly became deeply agitated . "
873580	873585	873588	873589	my lord	27330	" murmured the nobleman . "
873591	873595	873588	873589	my lord	27330	" continued Richard : "
873633	873634	873635	873636	Harriet Wilmot!—yes	1786	" "
873642	873649	873638	873638	I	0	" said the Marquis , faintly : "
873660	873661	873662	873662	Your	23157	" "
873678	873680	873667	873667	I	0	" interrupted Markham,—"when
873708	873709	873698	873699	her child	33631	" "
873721	873730	873713	873714	a God	44169	" exclaimed the Marquis of Holmesford , emphatically , "
873768	873769	873761	873762	my lord	27330	" "
873783	873818	873761	873762	my lord	27330	" Richard could say no more : he pressed his hand to his brow , as if to steady his brain and collect his thoughts ; and tears trembled on his long black lashes . "
873823	873852	873761	873762	my lord	27330	" cried the Marquis , rising from his seat , and speaking with more sincerity and more seriousness than had characterised his tone for many , many years ; "
873934	873935	873936	873936	My	0	" "
873939	873979	873936	873937	My lord	27330	" said Richard , in a voice tremulous with mingled emotions of joy and doubt ; and as he spoke , he also rose from his seat , and took the nobleman 's hand , which he pressed with nervous force,—"my
874048	874049	874050	874050	I	0	" "
874065	874070	874050	874050	I	0	" said the Marquis . "

874127	874131	874125	874125	you	23197	" observed Richard , "
874242	874243	874215	874215	she	1432	" "
874250	874257	874215	874215	she	1432	" exclaimed the Marquis , emphatically . "
874316	874317	874302	874304	the old woman	26813	" "
874322	874327	874318	874318	She	1432	" remarked our hero ; "
874336	874337	874318	874318	She	1432	" "
874350	874355	874339	874339	I	0	" interrupted the Marquis . "
874626	874627	874622	874622	Harriet	1432	" "
874634	874644	874622	874622	Harriet	1432	" exclaimed Markham , fervently clasping his hands together . "
874654	874659	874650	874650	she	1432	" continued the Marquis ; "
875041	875042	875036	875037	the stranger	2298	" "
875051	875062	875063	875063	I	0	" said Markham , the tears trickling down his cheeks . "
875075	875084	875063	875063	I	0	" continued the nobleman , after a pause . "
875208	875209	875205	875205	her	1432	" "
875221	875225	875226	875226	I	0	" asked Richard . "
875234	875239	875232	875232	her	1432	" was the reply : "
875387	875388	875389	875389	She	1432	" "
875398	875402	875389	875389	She	1432	" said Richard . "
875447	875448	875444	875445	Katherine Wilmot	1413	" "
875452	875457	875449	875450	Katherine Wilmot	1413	" exclaimed the Marquis : "
875466	875467	875468	875468	My	0	" "
875488	875489	875490	875490	I	0	" "
875497	875502	875490	875490	I	0	" interrupted the Marquis . "
875558	875559	875556	875556	Harriet	1432	" "
875570	875574	875556	875556	Harriet	1432	" said Richard , "
875808	875847	875804	875804	I	0	" The Prince then took his leave of the Marquis . Scarcely had Richard left the room , when Greenwood re - entered it from the back apartment . His countenance was pale — his manner was agitated . "
875855	875868	875804	875804	I	0	" demanded the Marquis , astonished at his friend 's altered mien . "
875884	876012	875882	875882	me	0	" was the answer . And Greenwood left the house abruptly . We must leave the reader to imagine the joy that prevailed at Markham Place , when the Prince returned thither , the bearer of those happy tidings which proved the legitimacy of Katherine and the innocence of her departed but not unlamented mother . Return we now to the Resurrection Man,—that incarnate fiend whose crimes were so numerous , and all of so black a dye . Firmly bound , and guarded by three officers , who kept their bludgeons in their hands , the miscreant saw that all resistance was vain : he accordingly threw himself back in the cab that was bearing him to prison , and gave way to his saturnine reflections . "
876027	876031	875882	875882	me	0	Katharine,"—it was thus he mused,—"a
876274	876380	876264	876264	I	0	" These and numberless other reflections , in which despondency and hope alternately asserted a predominant influence , occupied the mind of Anthony Tidkins as the cab proceeded rapidly through Bethnal - Green and Shoreditch,—then along Old Street — up the Goswell Road — through Northampton Square — and lastly along Exmouth Street , in its way to Coldbath Fields ' Prison . At length the cab turned into the short road which forms the approach , within the wooden railings in front of the governor 's dwelling , to the great gates of the gaol,—those gates over which may be read in large letters , "
876386	876827	876264	876264	I	0	" A shudder crept over even the iron frame of Anthony Tidkins , as those huge portals , towering high above the cab which now drew up close to them , seemed to frown upon him like a colossal genius of evil amidst the obscurity of night . Benstead leapt from the cab , and knocked loudly at the gate . The iron din was responded to by gloomy echoes from the courts inside . In a few minutes heavy chains fell , and the wicket was opened by a man bearing a lantern . Benstead whispered to him for a few moments ; and Tidkins was conducted into a little lobby on the left hand . The turnkey , who had opened the gate , then proceeded to the governor 's house , which was close by within the walls ; and , after an absence of ten minutes , he returned with an affirmative answer to Benstead 's request that the prisoner might be retained in custody in that gaol until a magistrate should otherwise dispose of him . The turnkey accordingly led the way through the wicket of a strong iron grating , across a yard where a watchman armed with a loaded blunderbuss was stationed , and thence into a building , up the narrow stone staircase of which the party proceeded , until they reached a cell , where the Resurrection Man , who was now released from his bonds , was left . Tidkins threw himself upon the bed and soon fell asleep . He was not an individual to whom danger or even the prospect of death could bring remorse : darkness and solitude had no alarms for him;—and , thus , in spite of the profound vexation he experienced at his present predicament , he yielded to the influence of fatigue and slept soundly . On the following morning a bowl of gruel and a piece of bread were supplied for his breakfast ; and he washed at the common sink belonging to that department of the gaol . At ten o'clock Benstead and two other officers arrived , placed manacles upon him , and conveyed him to a cab , in which they seated themselves with him . In about half an hour the Resurrection Man was placed in the dock at the Lambeth Street Police Office . The Prince of Montoni , attended by his solicitor , Mr. Dyson , had entered the court a few moments before ; and the magistrate , upon being made acquainted with his name and rank , immediately threw down the newspaper , saying , "
876892	876912	876883	876883	usher	23295	" Scarcely able to conceal his disgust at this fulsome behaviour of the magistrate , the Prince coldly said , "
876944	877912	876883	876883	usher	23295	" The magistrate turned very red , and bowed meekly , but without repeating his offer . The case was then entered upon . The Prince detailed the particulars of that adventure at the Resurrection Man 's house in the neighbourhood of the Bird - cage Walk , with which the reader is already acquainted : and he also related the subsequent circumstances connected with the blowing up of the den — a deed which had cost several persons their lives , and which ( added Markham ) was no doubt perpetrated by Tidkins himself . When these depositions were taken down , the Prince was about to enter upon his second charge — namely , the attack made upon him at Twig Folly : but the magistrate thought the first case had better be previously completed , and resolved upon remanding the prisoner for three days , in order to allow time to procure the evidence of those surviving policemen who had witnessed the fate of their brother - officers on the occasion of the blowing up of the house . Tidkins was accordingly remanded to Coldbath Fields ' Prison ; and the Prince of Montoni immediately repaired in his carriage to Holmesford House — the particulars of which visit have been detailed in the preceding chapter . On his return to the gaol , Tidkins was allowed to walk for an hour in the tread - wheel yard nearest to the entrance of the prison . There are several tread - mill yards in Coldbath Fields ' gaol , alike for males and females ; but we specify the particular yard in which the Resurrection Man was permitted to take exercise , because it has relation to a certain event which is to follow . It is also of the wheel in this yard that the fan , or balance , is seen above the wall near the south - western angle of the prison , by persons passing through Coldbath Square . The tread - wheel is an enormous drum , or cylinder , with ranges of steps all round it , at a distance of about a foot and a half from each other . Between forty and fifty persons can work on the wheel at one time . It moves slowly round towards the prisoners placed upon it ; and thus the step on which the foot stands descends , while the next step presents itself . A platform is built to half the height of the wheel ; and from this platform the prisoners step upon the wheel itself . They support themselves by a railing , and their weight keeps the wheel in motion . Thus they must sink with all their weight , as they work on that rotatory engine of diabolical torture . The action is that of going up stairs , without , however , actually rising higher ; for every step so reached sinks beneath the feet , and the prisoner is compelled to get upon the next one in its descent . Those prisoners who wait their turns to go on , sit upon the platform ; and the task - master in the yard directs the intervals of labour and those of rest . And upon this engine of torture , as we ere now denominated the tread - mill , not only boys of twelve years of age are placed , but even women ! Yes:—in this civilised country,—in this land where novelists and poets celebrate the chivalrous devotion which should be paid to the softer sex,—in this great city , where the pseudo - saints blurt forth their nauseating hypocrisy at Exeter Hall , and swindle the charitable of alms for the purpose of improving the condition of savages thousands of miles off , while there is such an awful want of instruction and moralising elements at home,—in the very centre of the English capital are women subjected to the ferocious torture of the tread - mill ! The food is scanty;—and yet the labour thus forced upon the poor sickly , half - starved wretches , is horribly severe . Three - quarters of the crimes which send prisoners to Coldbath Fields , are larcenies and robberies caused by dire penury and pinching want : the miserable beings are half - famished already when they enter that gaol ; but they are nevertheless retained in something closely bordering on that state of constant hunger , while the hardest possible labour is required from them ! Remember , reader , that we do not wish idleness to prevail in a prison . It is just the place where habits of industry should be inculcated . We therefore approve of the system of workshops established in Coldbath Fields : we admire the oakum - room — the room , too , where shoe - making is taught — and that department of the prison in which rugs are manufactured for a wholesale warehouse that contracts for the purchase of the same . But we abhor torture — we detest cruelty ; and the tread - wheel is alike a torture and a cruelty ! It makes the heart bleed in the breast of the visitor to the female - division of Coldbath Fields , to behold women nursing their babes at one moment , and then compelled to deliver their sucklings to the care of their fellow - prisoners , while they themselves repair to take their turn upon the tread - mill ! Talk of the despotism of Turkey , Russia , Austria , or Prussia,—talk of the tyranny of those countries where the will of one man is a law , be it for good or evil,—we solemnly and emphatically cry , "
877917	878339	876883	876883	usher	23295	" Flogging in the Army and Navy , private whipping in prisons , semi - starvation in workhouses and gaols , and the tread - wheel,—these are the tortures which exist in this land of boasted civilisation — these are the instances in which our rulers seek to emulate the barbarism of past ages and the wanton inhumanity of foreign autocrats ! We must in justice observe that Coldbath Fields ' Prison is kept in a most cleanly state . Perhaps the ventilation is not as perfect as it might be ; and certainly the stone cells must be awfully cold in winter , for there are no means of imparting to them any artificial warmth . But as far as wholesome cleanliness is concerned , there is not the slightest ground whereon to raise a cavil against the establishment . The discipline maintained in that gaol is on the Silent System . There it no separation — no classification — during the day ; but the plan of silence prevents the corruption of the only moderately bad by the inveterately wicked . At night each individual sleeps apart in a cell . Anthony Tidkins walked about the yard , affecting a moody and sullen air of indifference , but in reality catching with rapid glance every point of the buildings around him — every object within the range of his vision ; so that he committed to memory a complete map of that division of the prison where he was now taking exercise . Having walked an hour , he was re - conducted to his room where a bowl of pease - soup with a slice of bread was given to him for his dinner . In the evening he was supplied with a basin of gruel and another piece of bread , and was then locked in for the night . It was , as the readers must remember , in the middle of the month of March when these events occurred . At that season of the year the sun sets at about six o'clock ; and it is consequently dark at seven . The Resurrection Man was no sooner left undisturbed for the night , when he commenced the arduous and almost desperate attempt of an escape from the prison . Taking off his coat , he tore open the lining of the collar , and drew forth two files scarcely larger than watch - springs , and made of steel of an equally fine temper . "
878358	878607	876883	876883	usher	23295	" he exclaimed , as he bent the files almost double to try their elasticity , and then drew them over one of his nails to test the keenness of their teeth . It is not an uncommon circumstance for the police - magistrates at the offices not within the City of London to remand prisoners accused of heinous crimes to Coldbath Fields ' gaol ; and as such persons can not , according to the law , be deemed guilty until they be declared so by a jury , they are not lodged in the common dark cells allotted to misdemeanants or criminals sentenced to imprisonment within those walls . There is a room specially appropriated to the use of untried individuals who are sent to Coldbath Fields . That chamber is capable of holding four or five beds , and has two windows looking upon the prison - grounds . Those windows are , however , secured by strong iron bars outside the casements , which are made to open for the purpose of airing the room in the day - time . Tidkins had already carefully examined these bars , and had calculated to a nicety the exact time which it would occupy him to remove two of them by means of his files . It was seven o'clock when he commenced his labour ; and as the clock of the church on Clerkenwell Green struck eleven , that portion of his task was accomplished . "
878613	878628	876883	876883	usher	23295	" muttered the Resurrection Man to himself , with a low chuckle of triumph : "
878639	878804	878629	878629	I	0	" But his fingers were cut and lacerated with the process : he , however , assuaged the pain by greasing the flesh with the remainder of the gruel left in his bowl . The next proceeding was to tear his bedding into slips , wherewith to form a rope ; and this was accomplished in about half an hour . The window was not very high from the ground ; and he did not dread the descent:—but the moon was shining brightly — and he knew that watchmen , carrying fire - arms , kept guard in the prison - grounds . He looked up at the lovely planet of the night , whose chaste splendour was at that moment blessed by so many travellers alike upon the land and on the ocean ; and he uttered a fearful imprecation against its pure silvery lustre . But he did not hesitate many minutes : his case was desperate — so was his character . "
878824	878962	878629	878629	I	0	" he said to himself , as he fastened the rope to the bar which stood next to the place of the two that he had removed . Then he passed his legs through the window ; and clinging by his hands and feet , slid slowly and safely down the rope . He was now in the grounds belonging to the prison ; but the high wall , that bounded the enclosure , separated him from the street . Cautiously and noiselessly did he creep along , beneath the shade of the building — directing his steps towards the tread - wheel yard in which he had been permitted to take exercise , as above stated . Suddenly the noise of footsteps and of voices fell upon his ears ; and those ominous sounds were approaching . "
878965	878980	878981	878981	I	0	" thought the Resurrection Man , as he crouched up close beneath the building : "
879006	879015	879018	879018	you	0	" And he ground his teeth with rage . "
879028	879048	879018	879018	you	0	" said one of the watchmen to his companion , as they advanced round that part of the prison . "
879058	879063	879053	879053	my	0	" was the reply ; "
879117	879118	879108	879108	they	3365	" "
879121	879127	879108	879108	they	3365	" said the first speaker : "
879135	879136	879129	879129	he	23302	" "
879143	879148	879149	879150	The judge	3678	" exclaimed his companion . "
879179	879180	879182	879182	d'ye	23309	" "
879193	879194	879196	879196	he	23302	" "
879352	879353	879348	879350	the Home Secretary	27340	" "
879362	879368	879348	879350	the Home Secretary	27340	" observed the first speaker . "
879371	879376	879348	879350	the Home Secretary	27340	" said his companion ; "
879463	879537	879452	879452	he	36336	" The two men had stopped within half a dozen yards of the place where the Resurrection Man was crouched up in the deep shade of the building ; and every word of the above conversation met his ears . In spite of the peril of discovery which now seemed inevitable , the miscreant experienced a momentary feeling of pride and triumph as he listened to the observations which were made concerning himself . "
879547	879559	879540	879540	I	0	" said one of the watchmen , after a short pause : "
879579	879686	879687	879687	I	0	" This was meant as a joke ; and so the two men chuckled at it . Tidkins also chuckled within himself ; because he had just learnt that the watchmen intended to separate , and that consequently only one would pass him . He was still menaced with a fearful peril ; but he considered it to be only one half so great as it had seemed a few moments previously . Midnight was now proclaimed by the iron tongue of Clerkenwell Church ; and the two watchmen parted — one retracing his steps round the building ; and the other slowly advancing towards Tidkins . "
879699	880427	879687	879687	I	0	" thought the Resurrection Man , clenching his fingers as if they already held the intended victim 's neck in their iron grasp . But Providence saved the miscreant from that additional crime:—the watchman struck abruptly away from the neighbourhood of the building , and walked towards the boundary wall . His back was now turned upon Tidkins , who lost no time in availing himself of this unexpected relief from the danger which had threatened him . In fact , the very circumstance of the two watchmen having advanced so close to him in each other 's company,—which circumstance had menaced him with a detection that seemed unavoidable,—now proved most advantageous to his scheme ; for as he hurried rapidly on towards the first tread - wheel yard , he passed between the two watchmen , each of whom was retreating farther from him , the one by retracing his steps round the building , and the other by lounging towards the wall . Thus , while their backs were turned upon him , he gained in safety the tread - wheel yard where he had taken exercise , and every point of which he had accurately committed to memory . His movements were now executed with the rapidity of one who had well weighed and pre - considered them . Taking from a corner a gardener 's basket , which he had previously noticed there , and which was used to convey the potatoes that were dug up in the prison - grounds , he turned it bottom upwards against a low building , or out - house , which abutted with a shelving slate roof against the high wall . By means of the basket , he raised himself upon this roof — crept up on it — and with one nimble spring upwards was enabled to catch at the chevaux - de - frise , or revolving iron spikes , which were fixed near the top of the wall , and which thus hung over the out - house . Careless of the wounds which he received from the chevaux - de - frise , he scrambled over them , and gained the top of the wall . The wall was much too high to permit him to drop into the street with any chance of escaping a broken limb . This he had previously reflected upon ; and he now commenced the desperate feat of walking along the summit of that lofty wall — with a bright moon shining above , and the almost positive certainty of being observed by the watchmen inside the prison . To increase the personal danger incurred by this extraordinary undertaking , the wall is irregular on the top , breaking into sudden and abrupt falls towards the south - western angle , and then rising with elevations equally abrupt from that point to the north - western angle . This peculiarity of structure is caused by the unevenness of the ground on which the entire establishment with all its enclosures stands . The journey along the top of the walls was not even a short one . The object of the Resurrection Man was to reach the houses in Guildford Place , which join the prison - wall on the eastern side . The point where he ascended was nearly at the middle of the southern wall ; but between him and the south - eastern angle stood the gates and the governor 's house , which he could not pass . He therefore had to make a circuit comprising nearly half the southern wall — all the western wall — all the northern wall — and then a part of the eastern wall;—and this in the largest prison in England ! It was a desperate venture : but — as we have before said — Tidkins was a desperate man — and his case was also desperate ! Fortune often aids the unworthy ; and she did so upon this occasion . Scarcely had the Resurrection Man proceeded twenty yards along the wall , when the moon — hitherto so lovely — became suddenly obscured ; and a huge black cloud swept over its face . Tidkins cast one rapid glance upwards ; and his heart leapt within him , as he said to himself , "
880440	880832	879687	879687	I	0	" On he went — walking upright , and rapidly — with scarcely an unusual effort to balance himself upon that giddy height,—and stooping only when he reached any of those abrupt descents or ascents in the structure of the wall which we have ere now noticed . And now he has gained — safely gained — the north - western angle : he is pursuing his way along the wall which looks upon Calthorpe Street . At the slightest signal of alarm he is prepared to risk his life by leaping from the wall . But no one observes him : it is now quite dark;—he is far away from that part of the prison where the watchmen walk;—and the street beneath is empty . Here and there are lights in the upper windows of the adjacent houses : he can almost see into those rooms , above the level of which he is placed . Looking to his right , he perceives the dark outlines of the prison - buildings , between which and the northern wall , whereon he is now walking , there is a considerable interval , the intermediate space being occupied by the gaol - gardens . His heart beats joyfully — triumphantly : he has gained the north - eastern angle ! A glance to the left shows him the lights of Bagnigge Wells : before him are those of Wilmington Square ; and to his right is Guildford Place . He felt that he was beyond the reach of danger ; and so exhilarating was his joy , that a momentary dizziness seized upon him — and he nearly fell over within the precincts of the gaol . But recovering his balance by an extraordinary exertion , he planted his feet more firmly than ever on the wall , and continued his walk along the dizzy height . He was now again in danger of discovery ; for he had reached that part of the eastern wall against which the buildings and tread - wheel yards of the females ' department stood , and in the immediate vicinity of which a watchman was stationed . Nevertheless , the houses in Guildford Place were near ; and their back premises abutted against the outer side of the wall along which he was now proceeding . "
880849	881185	881186	881186	Thieves	2899	" he said to himself , as he cast a rapid glance upwards . But , no — the cloud passes ! It has passed;—and the bright moon suddenly bursts forth with a flood of silver light . Almost at the same instant , a loud voice raises an alarm within the precincts of the gaol : the sharp crack of a blunderbuss is heard — and a bullet whistles past the Resurrection Man , whose dark form , as seen by the watchman near the females ' department , stands out in strong relief against the moon - lit sky . The cry of the watchman is echoed by other voices on the prison side of the wall ; and Tidkins mutters a terrible curse as he hurries forward . But his courage does not fail him:—no — he is determined to sell his life as dearly as possible ! In less than a minute after the watchman within the enclosure had raised the alarm , the Resurrection Man reached the backs of the houses in Guildford Place;—and now the clear moonlight was of the utmost service to him , in enabling him to execute his movements with security and caution . He lowered himself from the prison - wall to the roof of an out - house , and thence alighted in a yard attached to a dwelling . The back - door of the house was locked and bolted inside : but this was a small obstacle in the way of one who had just escaped from the Middlesex House of Correction . Unable to waste time by proceeding with caution , and compelled to risk the chance of alarming the inhabitants of the dwelling , the desperate man threw himself with all his strength against the door , which broke inwards with a loud crash . The noise was followed by ejaculations of alarm in the house ; footsteps were heard overhead ; windows were thrown open — and the cry of "
881188	882105	881186	881186	Thieves	2899	" echoed along the street . Tidkins paused not to reflect:—he dashed through the house — along the passage to the front door , the bolts of which he drew back in a moment . The key was in the lock:—every thing now appeared to favour the escape of the Resurrection Man ! The front - door was opened in a few moments , just as the inmates of the dwelling were rushing down the stairs . But when they reached the passage , the door closed violently behind the intruder who had caused their alarm . The Resurrection Man was safe in the open street ; and he knew that he had a good start of the prison watchmen , who would have to make a considerable circuit from the vicinity of the females ' department to the gates , and from the gates round the south - eastern angle , ere they could reach the point from which he was now departing . Swift as an arrow he scud up Guildford Place — turned to the right — and slackened his pace only when he had passed through Wilmington Square . He gained the City Road , along which he walked somewhat leisurely towards Finsbury — well aware that his pursuers would not think of looking for him in a wide and open thoroughfare , but would rather prosecute their searches in the narrow lanes and low districts in the immediate neighbourhood of the gaol . His object was to gain his den in Globe Town ; for not a word had transpired during his examination before the magistrate at Lambeth Street , to show that the police had any clue to his place of abode ; and he felt certain that Banks would not have betrayed him . The undertaker , he knew , was too deeply concerned in many of his plots and schemes to risk a general smash of the whole gang , by making any unpleasant revelations . The Resurrection Man struck from the City Road into Old Street , and speedily reached Shoreditch . As he passed down one of the horrible lanes which lie behind Shoreditch Church , he observed the door of a public - house to be open . He was well aware of the flash character of the place , but did not happen to be known by the people who kept it . He entered this low boozing - ken , ordered a glass of something at the bar , and inquired for the evening paper . It was immediately handed to him ; for all flash houses of that description take an evening as well as a morning journal , that their customers may receive the earliest intelligence of each day 's Police or Old Bailey proceedings — matters in which the generality of them are very frequently interested . Tidkins turned to the most recent Police Intelligence , and found his own case duly reported . Nothing , however , was said in that or any other department of the paper , which tended to excite an alarm lest his house in Globe Town had been discovered or any of his accomplices in his various crimes had been traced . Thus reassured , he drank off the contents of his glass , and then recollected that he had no money in his pocket to pay for it . All he had about him when he was arrested , had been taken from him , according to custom , on his removal to Coldbath Fields . Scarcely had this new embarrassment presented itself to his mind , when the door of the tap - room opened , and a man came forth . To Tidkins 's infinite relief it proved to be the Buffer , who started when he saw his old friend at liberty . The Resurrection Man placed his finger upon his lip ; and the Buffer instantly checked the ejaculation of astonishment which had risen to his tongue . The trifling debt incurred for the liquor was immediately settled by the Resurrection Man 's friend ; and the precious pair left the boozing - ken together . As they walked along towards Globe Town , Anthony Tidkins related the particulars of his escape , at which the Buffer was monstrously delighted . Then , in reply to the Resurrection Man 's questions , the other stated that he had seen Banks on the previous afternoon , and that no inquiries of a suspicious nature had been made at that individual 's abode . When they reached the door of the Resurrection Man 's house in Globe Town , the Buffer took leave of his friend , with a promise to call in the course of the day and bring the morning 's newspapers . Tidkins was overjoyed when he again set foot in his back room on the first floor : and finding some gin in the cupboard , he celebrated his escape and return with a copious dram . He did not immediately retire to bed , although he was sadly fatigued and bruised by the achievements of the night ; but , taking down a bundle of keys from a shelf , he paid a visit to the subterranean department of his establishment . The moment he placed the key in the lock of the private door up the narrow alley , he uttered a curse , adding , "
882136	882196	882125	882125	I	0	" And the perspiration ran down his countenance:—for he trembled for the safety of his treasure ! With feverish impatience he opened the door , and entered that part of his strangely - built house . Having obtained a light , a new circumstance of alarm struck him : the door of the back room was standing wide open ! "
882213	882218	882219	882220	Some one	27192	" he cried aloud . "
882244	882314	882238	882238	he	27192	" With a perception as keen as that of the North American Indian following the trail of a fugitive foe , did the Resurrection Man examine the floor of the room ; and his suspicions that some one had been thither were confirmed by the appearance of several particles of damp dirt , which had evidently been left by the feet of an intruder within the last few hours . "
882319	882325	882238	882238	he	27192	" thought the Resurrection Man . "
882337	882365	882366	882366	I	0	" This was evident ; for the brick which covered the iron ring in the masonry of the chimney , had not been restored to its place . "
882374	882380	882480	882480	God	880	" cried Tidkins , aloud : "
882393	882475	882387	882388	Some one	27192	" With almost frantic impatience he raised the trap , and descended into the subterranean . Entering one of the cells,—not the same whence the Rattlesnake had stolen his treasure,—he raised a stone , and then almost shrank from glancing into the hollow thus laid open . But mastering his fears,—those fears which owned the influence of avarice far more than that of danger or of crime,—he held the lantern over the hole , and plunged his eyes into its depth . "
882482	882531	882480	882480	God	880	" he exclaimed , as four or five canvass bags met his view . Then , in order to convince himself of the reality of the presence of his treasure , he opened the bags one after the other , and feasted his sight upon their glittering contents . "
882542	882569	882536	882536	Banks	1300	" he mused to himself , as he restored the bags to their place of concealment , and then rolled the stone back into its setting : "
882716	882748	882670	882670	he	1300	" continued Tidkins , in deep perplexity , and almost as much alarmed as Robinson Crusoe was upon discovering the print of the human foot upon the sand of his island . "
882927	883389	883390	883390	Prince	44632	" Thus reasoning against the feasibility of his fears,—as men often do in cases of doubt and uncertainty , and when they are anxious to persuade themselves of the groundlessness of their alarms,—Tidkins left the subterranean , and returned to his chamber , where he immediately went to bed . But his fears were well founded : some one had visited the subterranean during the hours while he himself was occupied in escaping from Coldbath Fields ' Prison . That intruder was not , however , Banks — nor any one of the Resurrection Man 's accomplices in crime . We must now return to that beautiful little villa , in the environs of Upper Clapton , to which we introduced our readers in the early portion of this history , and where we first found Eliza Sydney disguised in the garb of a man . Nothing was altered in the appearance of that charming suburban retreat , either externally or internally,—unless it were that there were no dogs in the kennels nor horses in the stables , and that the elegant boudoir no longer displayed articles of male attire . But the trees around were green with the verdure of Spring ; the fields , stretching behind far as the eye could reach , were smiling and cultivated ; and umbrageous was the circular grove that bounded the garden . In the parlour on the ground - floor still hung the miniatures of Eliza and her dead brother — that brother whom she had personated with such fatal consequences to herself ! And now on the sofa in that parlour sate Eliza Sydney herself,—dressed in deep mourning . She was pale — but beautiful as ever ! The snow - white widow 's cap concealed her bright chesnut hair , save where the shining masses were parted , glossy and smooth , over her lofty and polished forehead . The high black dress and plain collar covered the snowy whiteness of her neck , but still displayed the admirable contours of her bust . Her countenance bore a somewhat melancholy but resigned expression ; and the amiability of her soul shone in her large , soft , melting hazel eyes . It was noon — about a week after the date of the incidents related in the preceding chapter . Scarcely had the time - piece upon the mantel proclaimed the mid - day hour , when a carriage drove up to the front door of the villa . A few moments elapsed ; and three visitors were ushered into the parlour where Eliza awaited them . These were the Prince and Princess of Montoni and Katherine Markham . Eliza extended her hand with ingenuous courtesy towards Richard , saying , "
883416	883428	883397	883397	me	0	" Then , offering her hand to Isabella , she added , "
883473	883666	883673	883673	Prince	44632	" There was something so sweet and touching — something so frank and sincere — in the manner of the exiled Grand - Duchess of Castelcicala , that Isabella 's heart was instantaneously warmed towards her . Moreover , the young Princess felt all the noble generosity of that conduct on the part of one who had lost a throne by the events which had led to the happiness of herself and her husband , and which had achieved the exaltation of her parents . Thus were those two beauteous creatures attracted to each other the instant they met ; and Isabella , instead of receiving the out - stretched hand that was offered as the pledge of friendship , threw herself into Eliza 's arms . It was a touching picture,—the embrace of that charming bride and that scarcely less charming widow ! In due course Markham presented his sister to the exiled Grand - Duchess , who received her in the most affable and cordial manner . When the first excitement of this meeting was over , and they were all seated , Eliza broke a temporary silence which ensued . "
883675	883685	883673	883673	Prince	44632	" she said , addressing herself to our hero , "
883712	883713	883738	883738	they	23351	" "
883725	883729	883738	883738	they	23351	" observed Richard , "
883785	883786	883787	883787	You	44632	" "
883793	883797	883798	883798	you	44632	" exclaimed Eliza : "
884020	884021	884005	884005	You	44632	" "
884036	884059	884005	884005	You	44632	" said Richard;—and Isabella , who was greatly affected by the noble behaviour of Eliza , enthusiastically echoed her husband 's sentiments . "
884067	884071	884091	884091	he	23366	" continued Eliza , "
884115	884116	884091	884091	he	23366	" "
884138	884142	884118	884118	I	0	" observed Richard , "
884152	884153	884118	884118	I	0	" "
884170	884174	884176	884176	Richard	874	" exclaimed Isabella ; "
884202	884203	884176	884176	Richard	874	" "
884209	884213	884176	884176	Richard	874	" said Eliza . "
884221	884230	884232	884232	me	0	" she added , with a sweet smile , "
884289	884290	884322	884322	Prince;—but	1796	" "
884295	884301	884322	884322	Prince;—but	1796	" exclaimed Richard , warmly . "
884310	884316	884304	884304	I	0	" continued the royal widow . "
884522	884523	884524	884524	We	23378	" "
884543	884547	884535	884535	you	23372	" said Isabella ; "
884599	884622	884624	884624	I	0	" Eliza pressed Isabella 's hand , and smiled sweetly upon her and Katherine through the tears that stood upon her lashes . "
884641	884650	884624	884624	I	0	" continued Eliza , after a short pause . "
885107	885108	885104	885105	your foes	23415	" "
885118	885130	885131	885131	Providence	878	" exclaimed Isabella , gazing with tearful affection at her husband . "
885138	885142	885131	885131	Providence	878	" murmured Katherine . "
885156	885161	885131	885131	Providence	878	" added Eliza Sydney . "
885528	885529	885519	885519	you	1792	" "
885540	885544	885531	885531	I	0	" observed Richard . "
885591	885592	885595	885595	Prince	44632	" "
885597	885601	885602	885602	you	1792	" returned Eliza ; "
885814	885815	885807	885807	he	27376	" "
885841	885848	885822	885822	your	23449	" ejaculated the Prince , fervently . "
885855	885859	885822	885822	your	23449	" returned Eliza . "
885905	885906	885909	885909	you	23449	" "
885921	885925	885909	885909	you	23449	" cried Richard . "
885974	885975	885966	885966	he	1532	" "
885981	885985	885976	885976	He	1532	" interrupted Eliza ; "
886262	886263	886246	886246	I	0	" "
886276	886280	886246	886246	I	0	" said Richard . "
886319	886320	886306	886306	I	0	" "
886331	886335	886306	886306	I	0	" answered Eliza ; "
886390	886543	886381	886381	he	1532	" Eliza was interrupted by a loud knock at the front door . Katherine sighed : for the words of the royal widow had aroused within her gentle breast painful remembrances of her own romantic and apparently hopeless attachment ! The door opened ; and Signor Bazzano was introduced . Richard immediately hastened forward to greet him . But — how strange!—a cry of wild delight burst from the lips of the handsome Castelcicalan , as his eyes encountered one particular countenance in that room;—and at the same moment Katherine clung convulsively to Isabella 's arm , as if to save herself from falling from the sofa . For Mario Bazzano was the hero of the young maiden 's romantic adventures at Hounslow ! Katherine , with the ingenuous confidence of a sister , had revealed to her brother , and also to Isabella , the particulars of those strange meetings with the "
886547	886599	886381	886381	he	1532	" and had not attempted to disguise the impression made upon her heart by that individual,—an impression against which she had vainly endeavoured to struggle . Thus , when those tokens of recognition were manifested alike by Mario Bazzano and Katherine Markham , both Richard and Isabella instantly divined the cause . "
886606	886627	886381	886381	he	1532	" exclaimed the Castelcicalan officer , endeavouring to throw off the trammels of embarrassment , and speaking in excellent English ; "
886646	886647	886643	886643	I	0	" "
886650	886657	886643	886643	I	0	" interrupted the Prince , laughing . "
886675	886676	886670	886670	she	28749	" "
886683	886720	886670	886670	she	28749	" cried Mario , in a tone which expressed some degree of vexation at this announcement — as if he dared not aspire to so near a relative of a personage of our hero 's rank . "
886730	886741	886728	886728	Bazzano	1532	" said Richard , shaking him warmly by the hand . "
886790	886813	886784	886784	you	1532	" And as he spoke , he glanced slily towards the blushing Katherine , who was half hiding her countenance behind Isabella . "
886820	886824	886784	886784	you	1532	" exclaimed Mario . "
886914	886915	886916	886916	We	23484	" "
886935	887011	887012	887012	You	23485	" said the Prince , again smiling — but with kindness , and in a manner well calculated to reassure the young Italian officer , whom he led towards Katherine . And , oh ! how the bashful maiden 's heart beat , and how crimson became her sweet countenance , as she felt her hand pressed in that of him who had now for some months occupied so large a portion of her thoughts ! "
887028	887482	887483	887485	the handsome stranger	45012	" whispered Isabella to Eliza , as they walked towards the window from which Richard was now gazing upon the prospect spread before the villa . Then Mario and Katherine began to converse,—timidly and with frequent intervals of silence at first : but by degrees those intervals became shorter and shorter;—and at length the young officer found himself describing how he had felt deeply grieved at being unable to utter a word to her in her own tongue when they had met in the fields near the farm,—how he had torn himself away from the spot and returned to London to study English,—how he had gone back to Hounslow a few days afterwards , and vainly wandered about in those fields with the hope of seeing her,—how he conceived at length that she must purposely remain within the house to avoid him , the idea that she had left the neighbourhood never entering his mind,—how he had returned again to London and pursued his English studies under the romantic impression that they would some day serve him in respect to the attachment he had formed for her,—and how he paid frequent visits to the vicinity of the farm , and was at length almost compelled to abandon the hope of ever seeing her again . All this he suddenly found himself telling her ; and she as suddenly found herself listening to him with attention,—neither quite recollecting how the subject had first been touched upon . Their pleasant tête - a - tête was at length interrupted by Eliza Sydney , who tapped them each on the shoulder , with the laughing assurance that the servant had already announced luncheon three times ; and then Kate 's countenance was again suffused with blushes , as she took the proffered arm of her lover to repair to the apartment where an elegant collation was served up . The afternoon passed speedily away ; and all were so happy that they were in no haste to break up such a pleasant party . Eliza accordingly insisted that her guests should remain to dinner — an invitation which was accepted . Indeed , it was eleven that night ere the Prince 's carriage and Mario 's horse were ordered round to the door . And when the young officer separated from Katharine , it was not without an assurance from her brother that he would always be a welcome guest at Markham Place . Great was the surprise , but not less the joy , of Ellen Monroe , when Katherine , on her return home and ere the two young ladies sought their couch , made her friend acquainted with the elucidation of the mystery of "
887487	887698	887483	887485	the handsome stranger	45012	" What contrasts does mortal existence present to view ! While some are joyous and happy in one place , others are overwhelmed with sorrow and affliction elsewhere ! At the same moment that the surgeon ushers a new being into life , the hand of the executioner cuts short the days of another . Here the goblet sparkles with the ruby wine — there the lip touches the poisoned glass of suicide:—in this abode a luxurious banquet is spread upon the table — in that the wretched inmate has not a crust to stay the cravings of famine ! Thus was it that while the hostess and the guests were blithe and happy in the villa near Clapton , a painful scene was in process of enactment elsewhere . It was about five o'clock on that same evening when a cab stopped at the prisoners ' gate of Newgate ; and from the vehicle stepped a tall , powerfully - built , and rather good - looking man dressed in plain clothes . He was accompanied by a Superintendent and Serjeant of Police . They were immediately admitted into the lobby of the gaol ; and the turnkey , after bestowing upon them a nod of recognition , said , "
887725	887726	887713	887714	the youngster	23312	" "
887729	887738	887713	887714	the youngster	23312	" replied the tall man in plain clothes . "
887760	887761	887756	887756	Cope	1797	" "
887773	887801	887767	887768	Mr. Busby	1798	" answered the turnkey . The tall man , who responded to the name of Busby , accordingly passed from the lobby into the governor 's office . "
887806	887843	887846	887846	I	0	" asked the turnkey , rubbing his nose with the end of the massive emblem of his office , and accosting the two police authorities , who had seated themselves on the bench facing the gate . "
887850	887855	887846	887846	I	0	" returned the Serjeant ; "
887897	887898	887899	887899	You	0	" "
887905	887910	887899	887899	You	0	" ejaculated the turnkey . "
887921	887928	887915	887916	Mr. Crisp	939	" said the Superintendent , pompously : "

888116	888121	888126	888126	Crisp	939	" answered the turnkey . "

888149	888154	888141	888141	you	939	" was the reply . "

888215	888223	888224	888224	We	23511	" returned the functionary thus appealed to . "

888298	888303	888255	888255	they	27139	" said the turnkey . "

888354	888359	888326	888326	they	23516	" observed the Superintendent . "

888389	888394	888395	888395	It	17	" moralised the turnkey . "

888417	888422	888427	888427	Crisp	939	" cried the Superintendent . "
888433	888434	888427	888427	Crisp	939	" "
888443	888448	888438	888438	I	0	" continued the turnkey , "
888471	888472	888477	888477	Crisp	939	" "
888548	888549	888525	888525	Lord	23524	" "
888568	888573	888576	888576	they	23527	" proceeded the turnkey ; "
888585	888586	888576	888576	they	23527	" "
888603	888608	888595	888595	they	23527	" asked the Superintendent . "
888613	888618	888595	888595	they	23527	" replied the turnkey . "
888657	888658	888663	888663	Crisp	939	" "
888685	888686	888688	888688	they	23535	" "
888691	888696	888688	888688	they	23535	" rejoined the turnkey . "
888702	888721	888700	888700	Busby	1798	" And , as he spoke , the tall man in plain clothes re - entered the lobby . "
888725	888730	888700	888700	Busby	1798	" asked the Superintendent . "
888741	888946	888733	888733	We	23537	" was the reply . The turnkey stepped into a passage leading to the interior of the gaol , and gave some instructions to a colleague who was stationed there . A few minutes afterwards Henry Holford , dressed in his own clothes , and not in the prison - garb , was led into the lobby by the official to whom the turnkey had spoken . The youth was well in health , and by no means cast down in spirits . His face , at no period remarkable for freshness of colour , was less pallid than it ever before had been . There were , however , a certain apathy and indifference in his manner which might have induced a superficial observer to conclude that his reason was in reality affected ; but a careful examination of the expression of his countenance and a few minutes ' study of his intelligent dark eyes , would have served to convince even the most sceptical that , however morbid his mind might for an interval have become , that excitement or disease had passed away , and he was now as far removed from insanity as the most rational of God 's creatures . "
888952	888982	888983	888983	you	27227	" said Mr. Busby , with great kindness of manner , as if he were endeavouring to conciliate an individual whom he actually deemed to be of disturbed intellects ; "
889012	889013	888991	888991	I	0	" "
889028	889040	889025	889025	you	0	" said Holford , an expression of slyness curling his lip . "
889046	889047	889048	889048	He	23540	" "
889058	889066	889056	889056	Crisp	939	" whispered the Superintendent to the Serjeant . "
889073	889078	889056	889056	Crisp	939	" was the reply . "
889087	889099	889085	889085	Crisp	939	" continued the Superintendent , still speaking aside to his subordinate . "
889140	889141	889134	889134	I	0	" "
889149	889153	889134	889134	I	0	" returned Crisp . "
889173	889174	889165	889165	you	26649	" "
889182	889187	889180	889180	Crisp	939	" rejoined the Superintendent . "
889204	889205	889197	889197	he	28502	" "
889219	889223	889208	889208	you	26649	" said Crisp . "
889229	889236	889226	889226	I	0	" answered the Superintendent , emphatically ; "
889255	889394	889248	889248	Busby	1798	" This was indeed the case ; for while the two police - officers were thus engaged in the interchange of their own little private sentiments , Mr. Busby had conducted Holford to the cab , and had ensconced himself therein by the side of the prisoner . The Superintendent followed them into the vehicle ; and , at the suggestion of Busby , who declared in a whisper to that functionary that three men were not needed to take care of one boy , the farther services of Crisp were dispensed with . And now the cab rolled rapidly along the Old Bailey , turned down Ludgate Hill , thence into Bridge Street , and over Blackfriars Bridge , in its way to Bethlem . How strange to Holford appeared the busy , bustling streets , and that river—"the
889396	889729	889208	889208	you	26649	highway"—on whose breast all was life and animation,—after the seclusion of several weeks in Newgate ! But — ah ! did he not now behold those scenes for the last time ? would not he thenceforth become dead to the world ? was he not about to be immured in a living tomb ? Never — never more would the echoes of the myriad voices of the great city meet his ears ! He was on his way to the sepulchre of all earthly hopes — all mundane enjoyments — all human interests ! Henceforth must that bright sun , which now steeped pinnacle , dome , tower , and river in a flood of golden lustre , visit him with its rays only through the grated window of a mad - house ! For the last time was he crossing that bridge — for the last time did he behold that crowded thoroughfare leading to the obelisk:—on the gay shops , the rapid vehicles , and the moving multitudes , was he also now gazing for the last time ! The last time ! Oh ! those three monosyllables formed a terrible prelude — an awful introduction to an existence of monotony , gloom , and eternal confinement ! Ah ! could he recall the events of the last few weeks!—But , no — it was impossible:—the die was cast — the deed was done — and justice had settled his destiny ! The last time ! And he was so young — so very young to be compelled to murmur those words to himself . The sky was so bright — the air of the river was so refreshing — the scene viewed from the bridge was so attractive , that he could scarcely believe he was really doomed never to enjoy them more ! And there was a band of music playing in the road — at the door of a public - house ! What was the air ? "
889736	890142	889208	889208	you	26649	" Merciful God!—he was now a slave of the most abject description ! The convict in the hulks knew that the day of release must come — the transported felon might enjoy the open air , and the glorious sun , and the cheering breeze:—but for him — for Henry Holford — eternal confinement within four walls ! The last time ! Oh ! for the pleasures of life that were now to be abandoned for ever ! For the last time did his eyes behold those play - bills in the shop windows — and he was so fond of the theatre ! For the last time did he see that omnibus on its way to the Zoological Gardens — and he was so fond of those Gardens ! Ah ! it was a crushing — a stifling — a suffocating sensation to know that in a few minutes more huge doors , and grated windows , and formidable bolts and bars must separate him from that world which had so many attractions for one of his age ! Yes:—he now beheld those houses — those shops — those streets — those crowds — those vehicles — for the last time ! And now the cab has reached the iron gate in front of Bethlem Hospital . There was a temporary delay while the porter opened that gate . Holford looked hastily from the windows ; and his lips were compressed as if to subdue his feelings . Again the vehicle rolled onward , and in a few moments stopped at the entrance of the huge mad - house . The Superintendent alighted : Holford was directed to follow ; and Busby came close after him . The great folding doors leading into the handsome hall of the establishment stood open:—Holford paused on the threshold for an instant — cast one rapid but longing look behind him — a last look — and then walked with firm steps to a waiting - room commanding a view of the grounds at the back of the building . On the table lay a book in which visitors to the institution are compelled to enter their names and places of abode . Holford turned over the leaves — carelessly at first ; but when he caught sight of several great names , he experienced a momentary glow of pride and triumph , as he murmured to himself , "
890157	890838	890152	890152	their	23554	" Busby , who was one of the principal officers connected with the establishment , of which Sir Peter Laurie is the intelligent and justly - honoured President , left the room for a short time , Holford remaining in the charge of the Superintendent . When the first - mentioned functionary returned , it was to conduct the youth to his future place of abode . Busby led the way through a long and well ventilated passage , in which about a dozen miserable - looking men were lounging about . Holford cast a glance of ill - concealed terror upon their countenances , and read madness in their wild eyes . But , to his astonishment , he beheld no horrifying and revolting sights,—no wretches writhing in chains — no maniacs crowning themselves with straws — no unhappy beings raging in the fury of insanity . He had hitherto imagined that madhouses were shocking places — and Bethlem worse than all : but distressing though the spectacle of human reason dethroned and cast down must ever be , it was still a great relief to the young man to find , upon inquiry of the officer , that there were no scenes throughout the vast establishment one tittle worse than that which he now beheld . On one side of that long passage were the cells , or rather little rooms , in which the inmates of that department of the asylum slept , each being allowed a separate chamber . The beds were comfortable and scrupulously cleanly in appearance ; and the officer informed Holford that the linen was changed very frequently . From the other side of the passage , or wide corridor , opened the rooms in which the meals were served up ; and here we may observe that the food allowed the inmates of Bethlem Hospital is both excellent in quality and abundant in quantity . There was a very tall officer,—indeed , all the male keepers throughout the institution are tall , strong , and well - built men,—walking slowly up and down the passage of which we are speaking ; and when any of the unhappy lunatics addressed him , he replied to them in a kind and conciliatory manner , or else good - naturedly humoured them by listening with apparent interest and attention to the lamentable outpourings of their erratic intellects . It is delightful to turn from those descriptions of ill - disciplined prisons and of vicious or tyrannical institutions , which it has been our duty to record in this work,—it is delightful to turn from such pictures to an establishment which , though awakening many melancholy thoughts , nevertheless excites our admiration and demands our unbounded praise , as a just tribute to the benevolence , the wisdom , and the humanity which constitute the principles of its administration . Oh ! could the great — the philanthropic Pinel rise from the cold tomb and visit this institution of which we are speaking,—he would see ample proof to convince him that , while on earth , he had not lived nor toiled in vain . Connected with the male department of Bethlem , there are a library and a billiard - room , for the use of those who are sufficiently sane to enjoy the mental pleasures of the one or the innocent recreation of the other . The books in the library are well selected : they consist chiefly of the works of travellers and voyagers , naval and military histories and biographies , and the leading cheap periodicals — such as The London Journal , Chambers 's Information for the People , Knight 's Penny Magazine , & c. Communicating with the female department of the asylum , is a music - room,—small , but elegantly fitted up , and affording a delightful means of amusement and solace to many of the inmates of that division of the building . When these attentions to the comforts and even happiness,—for Bethlem Hospital exhibits many examples where "
890841	891087	891088	891089	Merciful God	880	bliss,"—of those who are doomed to dwell within its walls , are contrasted with the awful and soul - harrowing spectacle which its interior presented not very many years ago , it is impossible to feel otherwise than astonished and enraptured at the vast improvements which civilisation has introduced into the modern management of the insane ! But let us return to Henry Holford . We left him threading the long passage which formed a portion of his way towards the criminal department of the hospital,—that department which was thenceforth to be his abode ! It may be readily imagined that he gazed anxiously and intently on all he saw,—that not a single object of such new , strange , and yet mournful interest to him escaped his observation . Suddenly he beheld a man leaning against the wall , and staring at him as he passed in a wild and almost ferocious manner . There seemed to be something peculiar in that poor creature 's garb:—Holford looked again — and that second glance made him shudder fearfully ! The man had on a strait - waistcoat,—a strong garment made of bed - ticking , and resembling a smock that was too small for him . The sleeves were beneath , instead of outside , and were sewn to the waistcoat — a contrivance by which the arms of the unhappy wretch were held in a necessary restraint , but without the infliction of pain . "
891091	891098	891088	891089	Merciful God	880	" thought Holford , within himself ; "
891126	891151	891114	891114	I	0	" His miserable reflections were strangely interrupted . One of the lunatics abruptly drew near and addressed him in a wild and incoherent tone . "
891157	891161	891114	891114	I	0	" he said ; "
891205	891761	891763	891763	I	0	" Holford felt a cold and shuddering sensation creep over him ; for these manifestations of a ruined intellect struck him forcibly — fearfully,—as if they were an omen — a warning — a presage of the condition to which he himself must speedily come ! He was relieved from the farther importunities of the poor lunatic , by the sudden opening of a door , by which Busby admitted him into a narrow passage with two gratings , having a small space between them . The inner grating was at the bottom of a stone staircase , down which another keeper speedily came in obedience to a summons from Busby 's lips . This second keeper now took charge of Henry Holford , whom he conducted up the stairs to a gallery entered by a wicket in an iron grating , and divided by a similar defence into two compartments . One of these compartments was much larger than the other , and contained many inmates and many rooms : the smaller division had but six chambers opening from it . The entire gallery was , however , devoted to those persons who , having committed dread deeds , had been acquitted on the ground of insanity . It was to the lesser compartment that Holford was assigned . And now he was an inmate of the criminal division of Bethlem Hospital,—he who was as sane as his keeper , and who could , therefore , the more keenly feel , the more bitterly appreciate the dread circumstances of his present condition ! And who were his companions ? Men that had perpetrated appalling deeds — horrible murders — in the aberration of their intellects ! Was this the triumph that he had achieved by his regicide attempt ? had he earned that living tomb as the sacrifice to be paid for the infamous notoriety which he had acquired ? Oh ! to return to his pot - boy existence — to wait on the vulgar and the low — to become once more a menial unto menials,—rather than stay in that terrible place ! Or else to be confined for life in a gaol where no presence of madness might tend to drive him mad also!—Yes — that were preferable — oh ! far preferable to the soul - harrowing scene where man appeared more degraded and yet more formidable than the brutes ! Yes — yes : transportation — chains — the horrors of Norfolk Island,—any thing — any thing rather than immurement in the criminal wards of Bethlem ! Vain and useless regrets for the past!—futile and ineffective aspirations for the future ! It was in the middle of April , and about two o'clock in the afternoon , when the Honourable Gilbert Vernon knocked at the door of Mr. Greenwood 's mansion in Spring Gardens . He was immediately admitted by a footman in livery ; and Filippo , the Italian valet , who was lounging in the hall at the moment , conducted him to the elegant drawing - room where the Member for Rottenborough was seated . As soon as Filippo had retired , Mr. Vernon said in a somewhat impatient tone , as he fixed his large grey eyes in a scrutinising manner upon Greenwood 's countenance , "
891786	891787	891817	891817	you	23558	" "
891794	891799	891791	891792	Mr. Vernon	1679	" was the reply ; "

891852	891856	891839	891839	I	0	" exclaimed Vernon , "

891886	891911	891874	891874	I	0	" returned the Member of Parliament , with the coolness of a man who knows he is dictating to one completely in his power . "
891914	891922	891923	891923	I	0	" said Vernon , biting his lip . "
891936	891937	891938	891938	I	0	" "
891949	891969	891970	891970	You	23558	" continued Greenwood , without appearing to notice the hesitation with which his visitor gave the promise of attention . "
892113	892114	892100	892100	you	23558	" "
892118	892152	892115	892116	Mr. Greenwood	903	" ejaculated Vernon , his face assuming so dark — so foreboding — so ferocious an expression that the Member of Parliament saw his dart had been levelled with the most accurate aim . "
892160	892188	892157	892158	Mr. Vernon	1679	" said Greenwood , playing with his watch - chain in a calm and quiet manner , as if he were discoursing upon the most indifferent topics . "
892235	892236	892237	892238	Mr. Greenwood	903	" "
892240	892255	892237	892238	Mr. Greenwood	903	" cried Vernon , starting from his seat , his countenance red with indignation , "
892278	892279	892280	892280	I	0	" "
892284	892295	892280	892280	I	0	" interrupted the Member , with the most provoking calmness : "

892354	892370	892371	892371	Your	0	" demanded Vernon , rage imparting a terrible emphasis to his deep - toned voice . "
892382	892386	892371	892371	Your	0	" answered Greenwood . "

892497	892512	892515	892515	I	0	" cried Vernon , hastily , and for the moment thrown off his guard . "

892555	892575	892552	892553	Mr. Greenwood	903	" interrupted Vernon , subduing his vexation and rage with a desperate mental effort , and resuming his seat , "
892603	892604	892590	892590	you	0	" "
892673	892687	892667	892667	you	0	" continued Greenwood , fixing upon his visitor a glance of triumphant assurance ; "

892744	892759	892760	892760	I	0	" demanded Vernon , who saw that he was completely in Greenwood 's power . "
892767	892773	892760	892760	I	0	" was the calm reply . "
892794	892795	892786	892786	I	0	" "
892798	892807	892786	892786	I	0	" repeated Vernon , his lip curling haughtily . "

893148	893160	893146	893146	you	0	" observed the guilty man , his countenance again becoming overcast . "
893168	893174	893165	893166	Mr. Vernon	1679	" continued Greenwood , emphatically , "

893534	893556	893528	893528	you	903	" cried Vernon , affecting an ease which he did not feel and a sudden familiarity which he did not like . "

893949	893964	893909	893909	I	0	" demanded the Honourable Gilbert Vernon , with a contemptuous curl of the lip . "
893971	893975	893909	893909	I	0	" responded Greenwood . "
894058	894059	894060	894061	Mr. Greenwood	903	" "
894063	894074	894060	894061	Mr. Greenwood	903	" said Vernon , speaking thickly between his set teeth , "
894089	894090	894083	894083	you	903	" "
894103	894304	894083	894083	you	903	" observed Greenwood . Gilbert Vernon then took his leave , in no very enviable state of mind under the conviction that his crimes had placed him so entirely in the power of such an extortioner as the Member for Rottenborough . We must observe , ere we conclude the chapter , that Filippo , the Italian valet , had listened at the door of the drawing - room where this interview took place ; and that not a syllable of the whole conversation was lost upon him . In the evening Filippo obtained leave of absence for a few hours ; and he availed himself of this license to repair to the villa in which Eliza Sydney dwelt . It was about five o'clock in the afternoon of the same day on which the interview between George Montague Greenwood and the Honourable Gilbert Vernon took place , that a post - chaise advanced rapidly through Ravensworth Park , towards the Hall . In a few minutes it stopped at the principal entrance of the mansion ; and the Honourable Mr. Vernon alighted . Quentin , who received him , made some inquiry in a respectful tone concerning his baggage . "
894317	894696	894305	894306	My valet	36456	" replied Vernon , abruptly . Thus , without committing himself by a positive assertion , he led Quentin and the other domestics who were present to infer that he had only just arrived in England , and had left his servant in London to clear his baggage at the Custom - House . Quentin bowed as he received that answer , and hastened to conduct Mr. Vernon to the drawing - room where Lady Ravensworth was seated . The widow and her brother - in - law now met for the first time . Vernon saw before him a young and beautiful woman , very pale , and with a countenance whose expression denoted much suffering — mental rather than physical . It was true that she had only lately become a mother,—that little more than a month had elapsed since she had given birth to an heir to the proud title and broad lands of Ravensworth;—and though the pallor of her face was the natural consequence of so recent an event , yet the physical languor which usually follows also , had given place to a nervousness of manner — a restlessness of body — a rapid wandering of the eyes — and an occasional firm compression of the lips , which indicated an uneasy mind . Alas ! upon that woman 's soul lay a crime , heavy and oppressive as a weight of lead ! The voice of the murdered Lydia was ever ringing in her ears;—the countenance of the murdered Lydia was ever staring her in the face — ghastly , distorted , and livid in appearance;—the form of the murdered Lydia was ever standing before her ! At night the spectre placed itself between the opening of the curtains , and seemed more palpable — more horrible — more substantial in the hours of darkness . No wonder , then , that her mind was restless — that her manner was nervous — and that her looks were wandering and unsettled ! But let us continue the thread of our narrative , taking it up at the moment when the Honourable Gilbert Vernon entered the apartment where Lady Ravensworth rose to receive him . Extending her hand towards him , she said , "
894728	894755	894772	894772	you	23610	" These words reassured Vernon on one important point : they proved that letters had been sent , conveying the intelligence of his brother 's death . "
894780	894784	894772	894772	you	23610	" answered Vernon ; "
894812	894813	894809	894809	you	23610	" "
894820	894835	894814	894818	That voice — that voice	23613	" shrieked Adeline , staggering towards a chair , on which she sank helplessly . "
894842	894959	894838	894839	Mr. Vernon	1679	" Gilbert was astounded at the affrighted manner and strange ejaculations of his sister - in - law;—but , seeing that she was on the point of fainting , he snatched from the table a small bottle of powerful scent , and handed it to her . She inhaled the perfume , which acted as a slight restorative ; but it was chiefly to the natural vigour of her mind , and to the imperious necessity in which dread circumstances had placed her of constantly maintaining as much command over herself as possible , that she was indebted for her almost immediate recovery from the state into which sudden surprise and profound alarm had thrown her . "
894970	894974	894961	894962	your ladyship	6346	" said Vernon . "
895018	895019	895010	895010	I	0	" "
895027	895043	895045	895045	yourself	23610	" exclaimed Adeline , in a tone which denoted the most painful excitement and agitation . "
895057	895061	895066	895066	your	23610	" said Gilbert ; "
895083	895084	895085	895086	My guest	6633	" "
895088	895096	895085	895086	My guest	6633	" repeated Adeline , with a shudder . "
895103	895110	895085	895086	My guest	6633	" exclaimed Vernon , somewhat impatiently ; "
895195	895196	895197	895198	Mr. Vernon	1679	" "
895200	895211	895197	895198	Mr. Vernon	1679	" interrupted Adeline , with a kind of feverish haste , "
895274	895288	895270	895270	your	1679	" And she fixed her eyes in a penetrating manner upon his countenance . "
895293	895335	895270	895270	your	1679	" answered Vernon , quailing not beneath that look — for he had so desperate a part to play at Ravensworth Hall , that he knew how much depended upon a self - command and a collectedness of ideas that might avert suspicion,—"it
895406	895407	895410	895411	Mr. Vernon	1679	" "
895413	895418	895410	895411	Mr. Vernon	1679	" again interrupted Adeline ; "
895449	895457	895466	895466	I	0	" she added , suddenly recollecting herself , "
895479	895480	895466	895466	I	0	" "
895486	895501	895466	895466	I	0	" said Vernon , gaining additional assurance , in proportion as Lady Ravensworth hesitated . "
895520	895521	895513	895513	I	0	" "
895538	895566	895524	895524	I	0	" cried Adeline , whose suspicions were robbed of much of their strength by the calm and apparently open manner of her brother - in - law . "
895623	895627	895634	895635	Mr. Vernon	1679	" added Gilbert . "
895637	895641	895634	895635	Mr. Vernon	1679	" continued Adeline , "
895684	895813	895814	895814	My	0	" And , as she spoke , she again studied his countenance with the most earnest attention . Desperate was the effort which the guilty man exerted over the painful excitement of feeling which this declaration produced within him:—in a moment he recalled to mind all the particulars of his meeting with the Resurrection Man at the ruined lodge ; and he also remembered that he had lost on the same occasion the scrap of paper on which was written the address of his terrible agent in crime . But he did succeed in maintaining a calm exterior:—steadily he met the searching glance fixed upon him;—and though his heart beat with fearful emotions , not a muscle of his countenance betrayed the agitation that raged within his breast . "
895818	895829	895814	895814	My	0	" said Vernon , in a cool and collected tone , "
895893	896135	896136	896136	You	23630	" Adeline listened to the deep tones of that voice which now rolled upon her ear like a perpetuation of the echoes of the one which she had heard in the ruins;—and she was still staggered at the resemblance ! She also remembered that , in spite of the darkness of the night , she had on that occasion caught a glimpse of the tall and somewhat stout form which had passed near her , and which she knew not to have been that of the Resurrection Man , whom she had since seen:—and she was bewildered more and more . But the calmness with which Vernon denied the circumstance of being in England at that time,—the steady , honest manner with which he declared that she was labouring under a delusion in identifying his voice with the one she had heard in the ruined lodge,—and the absence of any motive which she could conjecture for his maintaining his presence in this country ( even were he really here at the period alluded to ) so profoundly secret,—these arguments staggered her still more than even her contrary suspicions . On his side , Vernon was congratulating himself on the evident embarrassment of his sister - in - law ; and he felt convinced that the sound of his voice alone — and nothing that had passed between him and Tidkins in the ruined cottage — had produced an impression upon her . "
896151	896173	896136	896136	You	23630	" said Adeline , after a short pause , and now adopting the only course open to her in the matter . "
896230	896234	896212	896212	you,—to	23633	" answered Vernon ; "
896270	896271	896274	896274	us	23635	" "
896288	896292	896274	896274	us	23635	" exclaimed Adeline . "
896406	896414	896383	896385	Two distinguished noblemen	23642	" Vernon bit his lip with vexation . "
896422	896426	896383	896385	Two distinguished noblemen	23642	" continued Adeline , "
896436	896452	896460	896460	his	23637	" A dark cloud passed over the countenance of the brother - in - law . "
896463	896483	896460	896460	his	23637	" added Lady Ravensworth , who did not observe those manifestations of feeling on the part of Gilbert Vernon , "
896506	896507	896484	896486	your deceased brother	23601	" "
896555	896912	896540	896540	he	23637	" In spite of the necessity of maintaining the most complete self - command over himself , in order to carry out his plans successfully , Gilbert Vernon could not avoid those bitter observations which showed how deeply he was galled at the total want of confidence displayed in respect to him by his deceased brother . Adeline felt that the point was a delicate one , and made no reply . Fortunately for them both , each being much embarrassed by the present topic of discourse , a servant now entered to announce that dinner was served up . Gilbert Vernon and Lady Ravensworth accordingly repaired to the dining - room . We may here observe that Lord Dunstable and Mr. Graham had left the mansion some weeks previously , the young nobleman having recovered from the wound which he had received in the duel . When dinner was over , Vernon and his sister - in - law returned to the drawing - room , where coffee was served up . Adeline directed that the infant heir — then scarcely more than a month old — should be brought in , Gilbert having hypocritically expressed a desire to see his newly - born nephew . The request was granted:—the nurse made her appearance with the babe ; and Vernon passed upon it the usual flattering encomiums which are so welcome to a mother 's ears . But there was no falsehood in those praises,—however insincere might be the manner in which they were uttered:—for the infant was a remarkably fine one , and appeared sweetly interesting as it slept in the nurse 's arms . Vernon flattered the mother 's vanity so adroitly , by distant but by no means unintelligible allusions to her own good looks , as he spoke of the child , that she began to consider him a far more agreeable man than she had at first supposed he could possibly prove to be . Shortly after the nurse had retired with the child , Quentin entered the drawing - room , and , addressing himself to Vernon , said , "
896925	896926	896540	896540	he	23637	" "
896934	896938	896540	896540	he	23637	" returned Gilbert , "
896953	896954	896955	896955	I	0	" "
896968	896972	896965	896966	Mr. Vernon	1679	" observed Adeline , "
896993	897402	896984	896985	Your valet	23651	" Quentin withdrew for the purpose of sending Mr. Vernon 's domestic to the drawing - room ; and Lady Ravensworth , having remained for a few moments to finish her coffee , also retired . On the landing she heard hasty steps approaching and almost immediately afterwards Quentin appeared , followed by the Honourable Gilbert Vernon 's valet . They passed Lady Ravensworth as she was about to ascend the stairs leading from the brilliantly lighted landing to the floor above . But — O horror!—was it possible?—did her eyes deceive her?—was she the sport of a terrible illusion ? No:—a second glance at the countenance of the false valet was sufficient to confirm the appalling suspicion which the first look in that direction had suddenly excited within her . For his was a countenance which , once seen — if only for a moment — could never be forgotten;—and in spite of the new suit of complete black which he wore,—in spite of the care that had been bestowed upon his person,—in spite of the pains which a Globe Town barber had devoted to his usually matted hair — it was impossible not to recognise in this individual so disguised , the instrument of Adeline 's own crime — the terrible Resurrection Man ! As if struck by a flash of lightning , Adeline fell insensible upon the stairs . When she awoke , she found herself in bed,—not in the chamber where the murder of Lydia Hutchinson had been perpetrated : no — never since that fatal night had Lady Ravensworth dared to sleep in her boudoir;—but she had adopted as her own apartment , one quite at the opposite end of the building . Yet , vain — oh ! passing vain were the endeavours of the murderess to escape from the phantom of her victim:—had she fled to the uttermost parts of the earth — had she buried herself amidst the pathless forests of America , or made her abode on the eternal ice of the northern pole,—even thither would the spectre have pursued her ! It was midnight when Lady Ravensworth awoke in her chamber , after having fainted upon the stairs . An ejaculation of terror escaped her lips — for she instantly recollected all that had passed . The curtains were immediately drawn aside ; and a charming female countenance , but totally unknown to Adeline , beamed upon her . "
897408	897413	897406	897406	lady	8723	" said the stranger : "
897424	897425	897426	897427	A friend	26800	" "
897429	897438	897442	897443	a friend	26800	" repeated Adeline , with a profound sigh : "
897457	897474	897455	897455	enemies	11404	" And covering her face with her hands , she burst into an agony of tears . "
897482	897505	897477	897477	yourself	23658	" said the stranger , in so sweet and musical a tone that it carried to the heart conviction of friendly intentions . "
897524	897642	897643	897643	You	23658	" asked Adeline , relieved by her tears . Then she turned her still streaming eyes towards the stranger who spoke in so kind , so soothing , so convincing a manner ; and she beheld , by the mellowed light of the lamps that burnt in the chamber , a female of lovely person , but clad in deep black , and wearing the peculiar cap which bespeaks the widow . The respectability of this garb combined with the softness of the lady 's tone and manner , and the sweet amiability of her fine countenance , to produce the most favourable impression upon the wretched Adeline,—wretched alike through her own misdeeds and those of others ! "
897650	897653	897643	897643	You	23658	" answered the stranger:—"rather
897721	897722	897714	897714	I	0	" "
897734	897761	897714	897714	I	0	" shrieked Lady Ravensworth , the presence of Gilbert Vernon and Anthony Tidkins in that mansion , and evidently leagued together , recurring to her mind . "
897790	897791	897792	897792	Lady	8723	" "
897801	897806	897792	897792	Lady	8723	" was the reply . "
897881	897882	897885	897885	you	0	" "
897898	897902	897888	897889	Gilbert Vernon	1646	" exclaimed Adeline . "
897918	897959	897961	897962	that valet	23673	" She checked herself ere she uttered another word that might have led her new friend to marvel how she could possibly have obtained any previous insight into the character of that attendant upon her brother - in - law . "
897970	897976	897961	897962	that valet	23673	" said the strange lady , "
898025	898026	898022	898023	another Judas	23675	" "
898036	898058	898032	898032	you	23676	" cried Lady Ravensworth , with a cold shudder — for she knew how much of that appalling description was true ! "
898072	898077	898067	898067	I	0	" was the reply ; "
898102	898103	898105	898106	that friend	10694	" "
898108	898112	898105	898106	that friend	10694	" said Adeline . "
898116	898121	898114	898114	myself	0	" answered the stranger . "
898172	898173	898174	898175	Excellent woman!—heaven	23683	" "
898183	898213	898174	898175	Excellent woman!—heaven	23683	" cried Adeline , reassured by these words ; and , as she spoke , she caught her new friend 's hand and pressed it enthusiastically to her lips . "
898240	898241	898221	898221	I	0	" "
898250	898255	898247	898247	you	23676	" was the reply ; "

898729	898736	898714	898714	he	1646	" exclaimed Adeline , in affright : "
898743	898744	898740	898740	you	23676	" "
898747	898757	898740	898740	you	23676	" replied Eliza Sydney,—for she was the generous - hearted unknown,—"did
898771	898772	898805	898805	his	1646	" "
898781	898796	898776	898776	I	0	" cried Adeline , clasping her hands together , and speaking with hysterical vehemence : "
898841	898890	898838	898839	Gilbert Vernon	1646	" And she sank back exhausted upon the pillow , from which she had raised herself as she screamed forth that last accusation . Several minutes elapsed ere she grew calm enough to explain to Eliza the meaning of her exclamation relative to the voice in the ruins . "
898903	898907	898891	898891	You	23676	" observed Eliza ; "
899066	899067	899058	899058	he	1646	" "
899080	899084	899069	899069	I	0	" cried Adeline : "
899093	899094	899097	899097	you	23676	" "
899136	899140	899143	899143	he	1646	" demanded Eliza . "
899229	899230	899209	899209	he	1646	" "
899246	899250	899240	899240	your	23676	" said Adeline : "
899272	899273	899234	899234	your	23676	" "
899281	899285	899278	899279	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" returned Eliza . "
899312	899313	899327	899327	your	23676	" "
899317	899321	899327	899327	your	23676	" answered Adeline ; "
899406	899407	899400	899401	Mr. Graham	1753	" "
899412	899418	899400	899401	Mr. Graham	1753	" said Eliza , interrogatively . "
899429	899434	899400	899401	Mr. Graham	1753	" was the answer . "
899449	899453	899400	899401	Mr. Graham	1753	" observed Eliza . "
899474	899475	899400	899401	Mr. Graham	1753	" "
899482	899547	899548	899548	You	23676	" said Adeline , with a dreadful shudder , as she thought of the murdered Lydia Hutchinson . But Eliza Sydney did not comprehend that Lady Ravensworth had any source of affliction save the machinations of her enemies . In the morning , Eliza wrote the following letter to Filippo Dorsenni , Greenwood 's valet : — Ravensworth Hall , April 16th , 1841 . "
899590	899605	899584	899584	herself	1680	" I wish you to undertake the three following commissions as speedily as possible . "
899721	899770	899701	899701	she	23726	" In the second place , you must endeavour to discover the abode of the beautiful Georgian , Malkhatoun , whom , as you informed me some months ago — shortly after my arrival in England — Mr. Greenwood made over to his friend the Honourable Major Dapper . "
899856	899871	899891	899892	the servants	2611	" You can write to me to report the progress of these three commissions . "
899872	899875	899877	899877	Quentin	1704	" Well , "
899896	899931	899877	899877	Quentin	1704	" the Honourable Mr. Vernon is by no means the most agreeable gentleman that ever set foot in this house ; but his valet beats any thing I ever saw in the same shape . "
899932	899941	899943	899946	one of the maids	23737	" Did you ever see such a countenance ? "
899948	899967	899943	899946	one of the maids	23737	" I am sure it was not for his good looks that Mr. Vernon could have chosen him . "
899968	899991	899993	900000	another member of the female branch of dependants	23739	" He is just the kind of person that I should not like to meet in a lane in a dark night , "
900002	900011	900013	900013	Quentin	1704	" He certainly can not help his looks , "
900015	900025	900013	900013	Quentin	1704	" but heaven knows they tell amazingly against him . "
900026	900034	900036	900037	the butler	26635	" And what I think somewhat extraordinary , "
900039	900093	900036	900037	the butler	26635	" is that just now I found him in my pantry , balancing the silver spoons at the end of his finger , as if to tell the weight of them . So I quietly informed him that my pantry was sacred ; and he took himself off with a very ill grace . "
900094	900105	900107	900112	the first maid who had spoken	23743	" Did you notice him last night , after supper , "
900114	900148	900107	900112	the first maid who had spoken	23743	" when we got talking about the disappearance of Lydia Hutchinson with my lady 's casket of jewels , how eagerly he joined in the conversation , and how many questions he asked ? "
900149	900158	900160	900162	another female servant	23744	" Yes , to be sure I did , "
900164	900266	900160	900162	another female servant	23744	" he was as curious about the matter as if Lydia was his own sister , or daughter , or sweetheart . He wanted to learn how long ago it happened — how we knew that she had run away with the casket — and all about it ; and then , when we told him what we thought of the matter , he cross - questioned us as if he was a counsel and we were witnesses at a trial . But I wonder who this widow is that came last night , and seems so intimate with my lady . "
900267	900275	900277	900277	Quentin	1704	" She 's a very genteel person , "
900279	900317	900277	900277	Quentin	1704	" and seems to know how to treat servants , as if she had a great many of her own . You can always tell the true breed of people by the way they behave to servants . "
900318	900329	900331	900332	a footman	23745	" I 'm decidedly of your opinion , Mr. Quentin , "
900334	900389	900331	900332	a footman	23745	" A true gentleman or true lady always says ' Thank you , ' when you hand them any thing at table , and so on . But it seems that my lady is very unwell this morning ; for she and her new friend had their breakfast in my lady 's own chamber . "
900390	900409	900411	900414	one of the females	23746	" And the nurse and child are to remain altogether in my lady 's private suite of apartments , "
900416	900429	900411	900414	one of the females	23746	" Does any one know the name of my lady 's friend ? "
900430	900442	900444	900444	Quentin	1704	" Mrs. Beaufort , I think the lady's - maid said , "
900446	900453	900444	900444	Quentin	1704	" But here comes James White . "
900490	900499	900501	900501	Quentin	1704	" Been taking a walk , Mr. White ? "
900513	900524	900501	900501	Quentin	1704	" Yes — just looking about the grounds a little , "
900529	900540	900501	900501	Quentin	1704	" Handsome building this — fine park — beautiful gardens . "
900541	900551	900553	900553	Quentin	1704	" It is a handsome building , Mr. White , "
900555	900564	900553	900553	Quentin	1704	" and as commodious as it is handsome . "
900565	900569	900571	900573	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Very commodious , "
900575	900589	900590	900590	he	3220	" Nice snug little private door , too , at the southern end , "
900597	900621	900623	900626	one of the maids	23737	" Why , that was the very door that Lydia Hutchinson decamped by , when she ran off with my lady 's jewels , "
900628	900633	900635	900637	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Ah — indeed ! "
900641	900656	900635	900637	the Resurrection Man	3220	" And was n't her ladyship cut up at the loss of the jewels ? "
900657	900661	900663	900665	the female servant	23755	" Somewhat so , "
900669	900683	900663	900665	the female servant	23755	" But my lady is too rich to care very much about that . "
900684	900704	900706	900706	Tidkins	998	" And was there no blue - bot — police - case , I mean , made of it ? "
900708	900711	900713	900714	the maid	38487	" None , "
900716	900735	900713	900714	the maid	38487	" My lady possesses too good a heart to wish to punish even those who most wrong her . "
900736	900745	900747	900749	the Resurrection Man	3220	" A very excellent trait in her character , "
900766	900779	900752	900752	he	3220	" Was her ladyship at the Hall when that young woman bolted ? "
900780	900806	900713	900714	the maid	38487	" No : she had gone to London early in the morning of the very same day . But there 's my lady 's bell . "
900836	900853	900831	900831	she	23758	" Mr. Quentin , you are wanted in the little parlour opposite my lady 's room . "
900886	900914	900877	900877	she	23758	" Lady Ravensworth informs me that you were devoted to your late master : doubtless you are equally well disposed towards his unprotected and almost friendless wife ? "
900915	900941	900877	900877	she	23758	" If there is any way , madam , in which my fidelity can be put to the test , I shall be well pleased , "
900946	900953	900955	900955	Eliza	902	" In a word , then , "
900957	900998	900955	900955	Eliza	902	" your mistress and the infant heir are in danger ; and it behoves you to aid me in defeating the machinations of their enemies . After what I have now said , are your suspicions in no way excited ? "
900999	901005	901007	901007	Quentin	1704	" I confess , madam , "
901009	901022	901007	901007	Quentin	1704	" that the presence of a certain person in this house — — "
901023	901032	901034	901034	Eliza	902	" You allude to the Honourable Mr. Vernon , "
901036	901066	901034	901034	Eliza	902	" and you are right ! He has domiciled himself here without invitation — without apparent motive ; and he is attended by an individual capable of any atrocity . "
901067	901073	901075	901075	Quentin	1704	" Mr. Vernon 's valet ? "
901079	901083	901075	901075	Quentin	1704	" The same , "
901088	901131	901075	901075	Quentin	1704	" But I dare not explain myself more fully at present . What I now require of you is to watch all the proceedings of Mr. Vernon and his attendant , and report to me whatever you may think worthy of observation . "
901132	901143	901145	901145	Quentin	1704	" I will not fail to do so , madam , "
901147	901174	901176	901176	Eliza	902	" And now I have to request you to give me a small portion of the tobacco which the late Lord Ravensworth was accustomed to use , "
901178	901202	901176	901176	Eliza	902	" and the remainder you must carefully conceal in some secure place , as it may some day be required for inspection elsewhere . "
901203	901213	901215	901215	Quentin	1704	" Your directions shall all be implicitly attended to , "
901217	901244	901215	901215	Quentin	1704	" But might I be permitted to ask whether you are aware , madam , that the tobacco was sent to Lord Ravensworth by Mr. Vernon ? "
901245	901268	901270	901270	Eliza	902	" It is my knowledge of that fact which induced me to give those instructions concerning the weed — the fatal weed , "
901274	901289	901291	901291	Quentin	1704	" Ah ! madam — I also have had my suspicions on that head ! "
901301	901340	901291	901291	Quentin	1704	" I hinted those suspicions to the medical gentleman who attended my lord in his last moments ; and he had the tobacco analysed by a skilful chemist;—but the result did not turn out as I had expected . "
901341	901352	901354	901354	Eliza	902	" Lady Ravensworth has already mentioned this fact to me , "
901356	901389	901354	901354	Eliza	902	" I have , however , conceived a means of submitting the weed to a better test . But of this and other subjects I will speak to you more fully hereafter . "
901590	901609	901582	901582	he	48038	" What , in the name of common sense ! can he possibly want with meat - hooks ? "
901680	901705	901660	901660	he	998	" The truth is , I 'm fond of reading in bed ; and as a candle is dangerous , I prefer a lantern . "
901940	901946	901950	901950	himself	1704	" This is most extraordinary ! "
901952	901973	901950	901950	himself	1704	" He is evidently going out . But what is he about to do ? what can all this mean ? "
902011	902017	901983	901985	the Resurrection Man	3220	" What can he mean ? "
902336	902347	902349	902349	Quentin	1704	" If I can thus obtain a glimpse of him , "
902351	902369	902349	902349	Quentin	1704	" he can in the same manner catch sight of me the first time he turns round . "
902860	902869	902870	902870	he	3220	" And yet this must be the spot ! "
902882	902902	902870	902870	he	3220	" I went over the whole grounds this morning — and I could swear it was here that — — "
903706	903714	903702	903703	Filippo Dorsenni	1271	" Your orders have been punctually obeyed . "
903778	903810	903813	903813	I	0	" In the second place , I have discovered the address of the beautiful Georgian ; and can communicate with her so soon as I receive your instructions to that effect . "
903841	903942	903830	903830	he	23859	" To this letter Eliza despatched an immediate answer , praising her faithful adherent for the skill and despatch with which he had executed her orders , and giving him certain instructions in respect to Malkhatoun . She then repaired to the parlour opposite Lady Ravensworth 's own apartment ; for Quentin had already sent a private message by one of the female servants , intimating that he was anxious to speak to her without delay . When they met in the parlour , Eliza heard with profound astonishment the extraordinary narrative which the valet had to relate to her . "
903954	903958	903830	903830	he	23859	" observed Eliza ; "
904028	904029	904034	904034	him	23865	" "
904038	904046	904036	904036	madam	26758	" said Quentin , with a shudder . "
904082	904083	904084	904084	He	23865	" "
904090	904094	904084	904084	He	23865	" answered Eliza . "
904099	904106	904097	904097	madam	26758	" cried Quentin , somewhat reproachfully ; "
904156	904157	904158	904158	I	0	" "
904170	904178	904179	904179	I	0	" answered Eliza , mildly but firmly : "
904334	904335	904345	904345	madam	26758	" "
904347	904351	904345	904345	madam	26758	" observed Quentin , "
904363	904364	904353	904354	a magistrate	3072	" "
904385	904389	904390	904390	he	1679	" answered Eliza , "
904465	904466	904467	904467	I	0	" "
904476	904480	904474	904474	madam	26758	" said Quentin . "
904503	904504	904486	904487	Anthony Tidkins	998	" "
904521	904525	904506	904506	you	1704	" interrupted Eliza , "
904734	904893	904713	904713	you	1704	" Quentin could not help admiring the strength of mind , the sagacity , and the calmness which Eliza Sydney displayed in her self - imposed task of countermining the dark plots of the Honourable Gilbert Vernon . Though but a servant , he was himself shrewd , intelligent , and well - informed ; and he was not one of those obstinate men who refuse to acknowledge to themselves the superiority of a female mind , where such superiority really exists . He accordingly expressed his readiness to follow Eliza 's counsel in all things connected with their present business ; and he also promised that he would not by his conduct towards Tidkins excite in that individual 's mind any idea that he was known or suspected . He and Eliza Sydney then separated . We must pause for a moment to explain the system of argument upon which this lady 's present proceedings were based . "
904896	904902	904713	904713	you	1704	" she said to herself , "
905165	905223	905224	905224	I	0	" Ravensworth Hall was now the scene of plot and counter - plot,—of fears , suspicions , and a variety of conflicting passions . While Quentin and Eliza Sydney were engaged in the conversation above related , the following discourse took place between the Resurrection Man and Gilbert Vernon in the bed - chamber of the latter . "
905238	905242	905228	905228	I	0	" said Tidkins . "
905318	905319	905268	905269	my person	9179	" "
905322	905328	905268	905269	my person	9179	" exclaimed Vernon , impatiently . "
905357	905358	905353	905353	he	23899	" "
905376	905380	905353	905353	he	23899	" asked Tidkins . "
905406	905410	905353	905353	he	23899	" answered Vernon . "
905470	905471	905447	905447	you	23898	" "
905476	905480	905447	905447	you	23898	" growled Tidkins : "
905546	905547	905538	905539	the servants	2611	" "
905553	905557	905538	905539	the servants	2611	" observed Vernon . "
905712	905713	905699	905699	she	1680	" "
905736	905742	905699	905699	she	1680	" interrupted the Resurrection Man . "
905763	905767	905699	905699	she	1680	" said Vernon ; "
905864	905865	905868	905868	she	1680	" "
905898	905902	905885	905885	she	1680	" exclaimed Tidkins ; "
905909	905910	905911	905911	She	1680	" "
905918	905922	905911	905911	She	1680	" replied Vernon . "
905965	905966	905967	905967	I	0	" "
905980	905997	905998	905998	You	0	" said Tidkins , with some little hesitation , and after a few moments ' pause . "
906000	906018	906021	906021	me	0	" cried Vernon , turning shortly round , and surveying his ill - favoured accomplice with astonishment . "
906023	906031	906021	906021	me	0	" answered the Resurrection Man , coolly . "
906059	906060	906056	906056	I	0	" "
906065	906069	906070	906070	I	0	" ejaculated Vernon . "
906080	906086	906070	906070	I	0	" rejoined Tidkins , angrily . "
906101	906128	906096	906096	you	0	" demanded Vernon , more and more surprised ; for he knew that the Resurrection Man was not accustomed to boast without the power of performing . "
906136	906140	906096	906096	you	0	" answered Tidkins . "
906227	906228	906242	906242	you	0	" "
906235	906239	906242	906242	you	0	" cried Vernon , "
906271	906272	906279	906280	Mr. Vernon	1679	" "
906282	906290	906279	906280	Mr. Vernon	1679	" said the Resurrection Man , coolly . "
906307	906308	906309	906309	You	1679	" "
906318	906324	906312	906314	a wonderful man	23932	" observed Gilbert , slowly ; "
906360	906361	906340	906340	you	1679	" "
906371	906378	906364	906369	not such a fool as that	23933	" interrupted the other , gruffly . "
906392	906588	906380	906380	I	0	" said Vernon . And , without farther hesitation — though not entirely without misgiving — he sate down to pen a brief note to his sister - in - law , requesting an interview at her leisure . An hour afterwards Lady Ravensworth proceeded alone to one of the drawing - rooms . Eliza Sydney had offered no objection to this interview which Mr. Vernon had demanded with his sister - in - law : on the contrary , she was afraid that his suspicions would be excited were it refused . On her part , Adeline was far from feeling annoyed at the request contained in Vernon 's letter ; for she had been a prey to the most acute suspense ever since she had recognised the Resurrection Man in her brother - in - law 's valet . Her guilty conscience led her at one moment to believe that Tidkins was certain to discover that Ravensworth Hall was the scene of the mysterious murder in which he was her instrument ; and at another time she persuaded herself that her plans had been too prudently adopted to admit of such an elucidation . "
906604	906617	906631	906631	he	37404	" she thought , as she repaired to the drawing - room , "
906873	907000	907001	907001	My	0	" Thus musing , Lady Ravensworth entered the drawing - room . Her countenance was almost as white as marble ; and this pallor was enhanced by the widow 's weeds which she wore . We must here observe that there was , as is usual in the well - furnished rooms of the mansions of the rich , a screen in one corner of the apartment ; and on the same side were large folding - doors opening into an ante - chamber , which communicated with the passage and also with the suite of saloons intended for grand occasions . The moment Adeline entered the apartment , Gilbert Vernon , who was already there , rose from a sofa and hastened to meet her . "
907005	907019	907001	907001	My	0	" he said , taking her hand with an air of great friendship , "
907052	907053	907042	907042	I	0	" "
907064	907114	907061	907062	Mr. Vernon	1679	" answered Adeline coldly , as she withdrew her hand somewhat hastily ; for , deeply steeped in guilt as she herself was , she shrank from the touch of one whom she looked upon as the murderer of her husband and the deadly foe of her infant child . "
907124	907148	907122	907122	Adeline	1545	" said Gilbert , fixing his large grey eyes upon her in a searching manner , though she averted her looks from him : "
907165	907166	907167	907167	I	0	" "
907172	907177	907167	907167	I	0	" replied Lady Ravensworth , "
907222	907223	907224	907224	Your	0	" "
907245	907253	907238	907239	a stranger	2291	" said Vernon , biting his lip . "
907277	907278	907279	907279	My	0	" "
907305	907330	907279	907279	My	0	" observed Adeline , gathering courage when she perceived that her brother - in - law was rather inclined to conciliate than to menace . "
907341	907345	907336	907336	your	0	" said Gilbert , "
907355	907377	907378	907378	My	0	" Thus speaking , he hastily retreated from the room through the same door by which Lady Ravensworth had entered it . "
907383	907446	907378	907378	My	0	" murmured Adeline , clasping her hands joyfully together , the moment Vernon had disappeared;—and she also was about to quit the apartment , when the screen was suddenly thrown back . She cast a glance of apprehension towards the spot whence the noise had emanated ; and an ejaculation of horror escaped her lips . The Resurrection Man stood before her ! "
907455	907471	907472	907472	I	0	" said Tidkins , advancing towards her with a smirking smile on his cadaverous countenance : "
907478	907479	907472	907472	I	0	" "
907487	907517	907518	907518	Lord	23955	" cried Adeline , in a feigned voice , and endeavouring to subdue her terror so as ward off , if possible , the danger which now menaced her . "
907538	907547	907548	907548	You	37795	" said Tidkins , with a horrible chuckle . "
907566	907567	907548	907548	You	37795	" "
907590	907608	907582	907582	he	1679	" cried Adeline , astonished at her own effrontery : but her case was so truly desperate ! "
907622	907628	907609	907609	I	0	" said the Resurrection Man ; "
907700	907701	907702	907702	You	0	" "
907711	907718	907702	907702	You	0	" cried Adeline , almost wildly . "
907740	907741	907730	907730	you	0	" "
907756	907762	907744	907744	you	0	" returned Tidkins , maliciously . "
907895	907896	907897	907897	You	0	" "
907907	907927	907897	907897	You	0	" said Lady Ravensworth , whose tone and countenance , however , strangely belied the words which she uttered . "
907959	907960	907962	907962	Satan	1204	" "
907964	907976	907962	907962	Satan	1204	" cried the Resurrection Man , stamping his foot with impatience ; "
908002	908003	907992	907992	you	1204	" "
908006	908030	908034	908034	you	1204	" screamed Adeline , starting from her seat , and speaking in her proper tone , being now completely thrown off her guard : "
908038	908064	908034	908034	you	1204	" And her countenance , which expressed all the worst and most furious passions of her soul , contrasted strangely with her garb of widowhood . "
908073	908081	908071	908071	myself	0	" answered the Resurrection Man , brutally . "
908130	908176	908119	908119	I	0	" Adeline 's cheeks were flushed with rage when he began to answer her last question ; but as he went on , all the colour forsook them ; and , pale — pale as a corpse , she fell back again upon the sofa . "
908189	908208	908179	908179	I	0	" said the Resurrection Man , coolly surveying the condition to which he had reduced the guilty woman . "
908248	908282	908283	908283	You	0	" Lady Ravensworth cast a rapid glance at his countenance as he uttered these words ; and catching at the assurance which they conveyed , she said in a low and hollow tone , "
908294	908295	908283	908283	You	0	" "
908302	908306	908283	908283	You	0	" cried Tidkins . "
908322	908323	908311	908311	he	1679	" "
908335	908345	908327	908327	you	0	" demanded Adeline , almost suffocated by painful emotions . "
908354	908355	908356	908356	He	1679	" "
908362	908374	908356	908356	He	1679	" answered Tidkins , in a less familiar tone than before : "
908393	908394	908381	908381	he	1679	" "
908404	908412	908399	908399	you	0	" exclaimed Adeline , with hysterical impatience . "
908430	908436	908419	908419	ma'am	26745	" rejoined the Resurrection Man . "
908465	908466	908467	908467	He	1679	" "
908472	908478	908467	908467	He	1679	" said Adeline , bitterly . "
908509	908515	908480	908480	he	1679	" continued the Resurrection Man ; "
908567	908568	908557	908557	I	0	" "
908572	908579	908557	908557	I	0	" repeated Lady Ravensworth , disdainfully . "
908592	908600	908582	908582	ma'am	26745	" returned Tidkins , with a leer . "
908640	908641	908624	908624	I	0	" "
908661	908671	908644	908644	you	0	" cried Adeline , again becoming flushed with indignation . "
908680	908686	908672	908672	I	0	" answered Tidkins , coolly ; "
908723	908724	908718	908718	I	0	" "
908728	908732	908735	908735	you	0	" shrieked Adeline : "
908738	908739	908735	908735	you	0	" "
908783	908787	908776	908777	Lydia Hutchinson	1544	" answered Tidkins ; "
908814	908815	908806	908806	I	0	" "
908820	908826	908806	908806	I	0	" cried Adeline , wildly : "
908838	908839	908846	908846	ma'am	26745	" "
908848	908852	908846	908846	ma'am	26745	" returned Tidkins . "
908880	908881	908846	908846	ma'am	26745	" "
908885	908899	908846	908846	ma'am	26745	" said Adeline , speaking in a tone as if she were suffocating . "
908905	908910	908901	908901	I	0	" was the answer . "
908946	908947	908929	908929	you	26745	" "
908954	908959	908929	908929	you	26745	" screamed Lady Ravensworth . "
909030	909031	909021	909021	me	0	" "
909041	909045	909021	909021	me	0	" answered Tidkins . "
909059	909069	909047	909047	I	0	" he added , with a low chuckling laugh . "
909093	909099	909086	909086	he	27435	" cried Adeline , rapidly . "
909109	909115	909100	909100	I	0	" answered the Resurrection Man . "
909193	909220	909182	909182	I	0	" Having thus expressed his appalling menaces , the Resurrection Man hurried from the apartment . Lady Ravensworth pressed her hands to her brow , murmuring , "
909234	909342	909229	909229	I	0	" A quarter of an hour after the interview between Lady Ravensworth and the Resurrection Man , Eliza Sydney repaired to the little parlour before mentioned , in compliance with a message which had been conveyed to her from Quentin . The moment she entered that room she was struck by the ghastly and alarming appearance of the valet . He was pacing the apartment with agitated steps ; his face was as pale as death — his eyes rolled wildly in their sockets — and his entire aspect was that of a man who had just seen some terrible spectacle , or heard some appalling revelation . "
909356	909373	909376	909376	madam	26758	" asked Eliza , advancing towards the valet , after she had carefully closed the door . "
909383	909399	909380	909381	Mrs. Beaufort	1806	" exclaimed Quentin , clasping his hands together through the intenseness of his mental anguish ; "
909462	909463	909464	909464	Quentin	1704	" "
909470	909474	909464	909464	Quentin	1704	" cried Eliza . "
909486	909487	909488	909488	Madam	26758	" "
909490	909509	909488	909488	Madam	26758	" said the valet , drawing close to her , and speaking in a low and hollow tone , "
909529	909530	909516	909517	Lydia Hutchinson	1544	" "
909545	909549	909533	909534	the nurse	3335	" answered Eliza ; "
909559	909560	909551	909552	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" "
909570	909574	909565	909565	madam	26758	" observed Quentin . "
909594	909595	909597	909597	you	1704	" "
909603	909610	909597	909597	you	1704	" cried Eliza , somewhat impatiently . "
909629	909630	909597	909597	you	1704	" "
909639	909643	909597	909597	you	1704	" said Quentin , "
909700	909701	909686	909689	Gilbert Vernon,—that Lady Ravensworth	1680	" "
909705	909711	909712	909713	A murderess	15424	" said Eliza , hastily . "
909715	909731	909712	909713	A murderess	15424	" returned Quentin , shuddering from head to foot as he uttered the appalling word . "
909740	909750	909737	909737	I	0	" exclaimed Eliza , the colour forsaking her cheeks . "
909777	909778	909784	909784	madam	26758	" "
909786	909796	909781	909781	I	0	" said the valet , in a mournful tone ; "
909839	909840	909836	909837	Lydia Hutchinson	1544	" "
909853	909862	909851	909851	Quentin	1704	" exclaimed Eliza Sydney , now greatly excited . "
909873	909874	909867	909867	you	1704	" "
909890	909895	909888	909888	madam	26758	" said the valet . "
909952	909953	909937	909938	my lady	37795	" "
909965	909969	909937	909938	my lady	37795	" observed Eliza . "
909977	909981	909975	909975	madam	26758	" continued Quentin , "
910172	910173	910168	910168	she	37795	" "
910180	910184	910168	910168	she	37795	" exclaimed Eliza . "
910202	910203	910168	910168	she	37795	" "
910215	910219	910213	910213	madam	26758	" added Quentin , "
910241	910278	910229	910239	that fiend who was hired by my lady to murder her	24055	" The valet then detailed at length all the conversation which had taken place between the Resurrection Man and Lady Ravensworth , and which explained wherefore Tidkins had fished up the body of the murdered woman . "
910284	910296	910229	910239	that fiend who was hired by my lady to murder her	24055	" said Eliza , horror - struck at all she heard , "
910313	910314	910304	910304	Tidkins	1061	" "
910333	910337	910229	910239	that fiend who was hired by my lady to murder her	24055	" continued Quentin : "
910360	910361	910348	910348	I	0	" "
910369	910375	910366	910366	my	0	" said Eliza , firmly . "
910430	910431	910432	910432	I	0	" "
910447	910451	910435	910435	I	0	" observed Quentin . "
910472	910473	910469	910470	Lydia Hutchinson	1544	" "
910480	910489	910469	910470	Lydia Hutchinson	1544	" ejaculated Eliza Sydney , with a shudder . "
910566	910567	910551	910551	he	1061	" "
910582	910593	910594	910594	you	24067	" asked Quentin , profoundly surprised at the resolution of Eliza Sydney:—"will
910633	910634	910624	910624	you	24067	" "
910643	910647	910624	910624	you	24067	" answered Eliza . "
910694	910695	910691	910691	her	27627	" "
910706	910715	910691	910691	her	27627	" said Quentin , in a musing manner ; "
910755	910766	910753	910753	Madam	26758	" added the valet , turning abruptly round towards Eliza , "
910805	910897	910898	910898	Your	26758	" How powerful is the moral influence of a virtuous woman , performing painful but solemn , though self - imposed duties ! And , oh ! had that man , who now felt and acknowledged this influence,—had he known that he stood in the presence of one whose brow had been adorned with a diadem , and who still possessed a ducal title , although she used it not,—had he known all this , he would have fallen at her feet , in homage to one so great and good ! "
910920	910924	910917	910917	you	1704	" exclaimed Eliza . "
911102	911103	911106	911106	madam	26758	" "
911108	911120	911106	911106	madam	26758	" exclaimed Quentin , in unfeigned admiration of this excellent lady ; "
911146	911147	911143	911144	public executioners	24092	" "
911156	911162	911154	911154	Quentin	1704	" said Eliza , impressively . "
911188	911189	911169	911169	I	0	" "
911211	911216	911192	911192	madam	26758	" cried the valet . "
911223	911227	911218	911218	you	26758	" said Eliza . "
911254	911255	911258	911258	madam	26758	" "
911260	911264	911258	911258	madam	26758	" returned Quentin : "
911275	911276	911272	911272	your	26758	" "
911293	911305	911306	911306	I	0	" said Eliza , in a low , but emphatic tone . "
911314	911319	911312	911312	madam	26758	" observed the valet . "
911336	911337	911323	911323	I	0	" "
911348	911352	911339	911339	I	0	" returned Eliza . "
911453	911454	911455	911455	I	0	" "
911461	911465	911459	911459	madam	26758	" said Quentin . "
911483	911936	911475	911476	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" The valet then retired ; and Eliza hurried back to Adeline 's apartments . There a most painful — a most distressing scene took place . The nurse was dismissed with the child into a remote chamber of the same suite ; and when Eliza was alone with Adeline , she broke to the miserable lady her knowledge of the fearful crime which had put an end to the existence of Lydia Hutchinson . And , oh ! how gently — how delicately — and in what a purely Christian spirit of charity , did Eliza perform this most difficult — this most melancholy duty ! It was not as an avenger , menacing the thunders of the law , that Eliza spoke : it was not as one prepared to deliver up the criminal to justice , that she addressed herself to Lady Ravensworth . No:—it was as a true disciple of Him with whom is vengeance as well as mercy , that she communed with Adeline : and this wretched woman found , to her astonishment , that she possessed a friend who would pray with her , solace her , and conceal her guilt , instead of a being prepared to expose , to disgrace , and to abandon her upon the plea of performing a duty which every one owes to society ! Then , when Lady Ravensworth was sufficiently composed — when the first terrific shock was over,—she related , truly and minutely , her entire history : she revealed to Eliza all those particulars of her connexion with Lydia Hutchinson , which are known to the reader ; she concealed nothing — for the unparalleled generosity of Eliza 's mind and conduct aroused in Adeline 's heart all the better feelings of her sex and nature . Though the crime of murder is so horrible that there exists for it scarcely the shadow of extenuation,—still when the case of Lady Ravensworth was calmly considered,—when it was remembered how she had been goaded to madness and desperation by the conduct of Lydia Hutchinson,—when all the circumstances that united at the time to cause her reason to totter upon its seat , were dispassionately viewed,—even the well - ordered mind of Eliza Sydney was induced to admit that , if ever such shadow of extenuation did exist , it was in this most lamentable episode in the history of the human race . And , oh ! with what feelings of profound — ineffable gratitude did Adeline throw herself at the feet of that angel who seemed to have been sent from above to teach her that there was hope for even the greatest criminal , and that "
911961	911962	911963	911963	You	24109	" "
911976	911980	911963	911963	You	24109	" said Eliza : "
912199	912522	912523	912523	You	24114	" This was the holy and touching language with which Eliza Sydney sought to move the heart of Lady Ravensworth to penitence . Could such wholesome means fail of success ? No:—and Adeline felt rejoiced that her secret had become known to one who availed herself of that knowledge for such excellent purposes ! The comprehensive mind of Eliza Sydney enabled her to embrace at a glance all the new difficulties which the crime of Adeline had conjured up . Eliza 's aim , as before stated , was to take such effectual steps to stop the guilty career of Vernon , that the heir of Ravensworth should be entirely freed from any farther peril at the hands of his unnatural uncle . But the very same moment that ruined Vernon and his atrocious assistant , might bring destruction upon Adeline ; for when the strong grasp of the law once fixed itself on Tidkins , there was no guarantee that he would not , in his rage , reveal the terrible mystery respecting the fate of Lydia Hutchinson . This chance was duly weighed by Eliza Sydney ; but she conceived a plan to save Adeline from the overwhelming consequences of such an exposure . What this project was will be explained hereafter:—suffice it for the present to say that it obviated the necessity of any change in the policy already adopted to defeat and punish Gilbert Vernon and Tidkins ; and that Adeline gratefully assented to the conditions which it involved . A far more embarrassing subject for immediate consideration presented itself to the mind of Eliza Sydney . This was how to advise Lady Ravensworth to act in respect to the requisition made by Gilbert Vernon , and so energetically backed by Anthony Tidkins , relative to her presence in the drawing and dining rooms . But at length Eliza decided upon recommending Adeline to yield in this instance . "
912545	912549	912523	912523	You	24114	" said Eliza ; "
912603	912604	912605	912605	I	0	" "
912615	912708	912610	912610	you	24114	" returned Adeline . She accordingly presided at the dinner - table that very evening:—and thus was the promise , made by the Resurrection Man to his employer , fulfilled to the letter . During the repast , Vernon endeavoured to ingratiate himself as much as possible with the two ladies : but Adeline was too unhappy even to affect any feeling beyond cold politeness ; and Eliza Sydney was only distantly courteous . Coffee was served in the drawing - room ; and afterwards the ladies withdrew to their own apartments . "
912717	912728	912610	912610	you	24114	" said Vernon to himself , when he was alone : "
912778	913105	913106	913106	I	0	" That night , at eleven o'clock , Eliza Sydney stole from the mansion , Adeline and Quentin being alone cognisant of her proceeding . In the garden she met the faithful valet , who was provided with a drag , a mattock , a spade , and a sack . They repaired together to the field in which was the pond where the remains of Lydia Hutchinson were concealed . Quentin , who had purposely reconnoitred the vicinity in the afternoon , proceeded to dig a grave in a spot where there was no grass , and at a distance of about twenty yards from the water . This labour occupied an hour : and , when it was concluded , he proceeded with Eliza to the pond . The drag was used successfully ; and the corpse was drawn to land . It was then wrapped in a large sheet which Eliza had brought for the purpose , and carried to the grave hollowed to receive it . Eliza breathed a prayer for the soul of her whose remains were denied Christian sepulture , while Quentin threw back the soil . The superfluous earth was conveyed in the sack to the pond ; and thus all traces of this hurried burial disappeared . Eliza and Quentin then returned to the mansion . On the following morning , after breakfast , Eliza Sydney walked out alone , and repaired to a grove at a short distance from the mansion . A cab , containing two persons , drove up to the same spot a few moments afterwards ; and Filippo , having leapt out , assisted Malkhatoun to alight . Eliza immediately joined them ; and they all three entered the grove together . When they had proceeded so far as to be beyond the range of the cab - driver 's hearing , Eliza stopped , and , addressing herself to Malkhatoun , said , "
913133	913134	913106	913106	I	0	" "
913145	913159	913135	913135	I	0	" was the reply , spoken with singular accuracy for an oriental foreigner . "
913166	913170	913171	913171	I	0	" continued Eliza : "
913222	913223	913229	913229	lady	8723	" "
913231	913235	913229	913229	lady	8723	" answered Malkhatoun ; "
913255	913256	913251	913253	the female slaves	24123	" "
913264	913268	913251	913253	the female slaves	24123	" inquired Eliza . "
913271	913276	913251	913253	the female slaves	24123	" was the reply . "
913282	913291	913293	913294	many slaves	24125	chief,"—and as she spoke , tears started into her eyes:—"he
913335	913336	913338	913338	you	24119	" "
913350	913354	913357	913357	lady	8723	" asked Eliza . "
913365	913369	913357	913357	lady	8723	" replied Malkhatoun ; "
913418	913419	913406	913406	he	24131	" "
913430	913503	913504	913504	Lady	8723	" observed Eliza . As she spoke , she produced from her reticule a small galley - pot containing some of the late Lord Ravensworth 's tobacco : then she drew forth a box of lucifer - matches . Malkhatoun held the galley - pot , while Eliza procured a light ; and the flame was then applied to the tobacco . The beautiful Georgian immediately inhaled the vapour , and said , "
913539	913540	913532	913532	he	24133	" "
913547	913551	913532	913532	he	24133	" murmured Eliza . "
913556	913560	913544	913544	I	0	" continued Malkhatoun , "
913619	913620	913621	913621	I	0	" "
913629	913633	913623	913623	you	0	" said Eliza . "

913704	913708	913709	913709	I	0	" answered Malkhatoun . "

913788	913814	913775	913775	you	24149	" asked Eliza , the tears trickling down her cheeks — for Malkhatoun 's voice was soft and plaintive as she told her artless tale . "
913837	913841	913815	913815	I	0	" replied Malkhatoun . "

913930	914342	913910	913910	my	0	" said Filippo . Malkhatoun could scarcely believe her ears ; but when she saw that Eliza was really in earnest , she threw herself at the feet of her benefactress , whose hand she covered with her kisses and her tears . Eliza hastened to raise her from that posture ; and when the now happy Georgian became composed , they all three retraced their steps to the cab . Malkhatoun and Filippo returned to London ; and Eliza retraced her way to Ravensworth Hall . Nor did she forget her promise to Malkhatoun ; and two days afterwards the fair Georgian embarked at Gravesend on board a ship bound for the Levant . Nearly five weeks had elapsed since the day when the noble - minded Eliza Sydney first took up her quarters at Ravensworth Hall . Time was , therefore , now verging towards the close of May , 1841 . It was at about nine o'clock in the morning of a charming day , at this period , that the Resurrection Man sauntered leisurely from the servants ' offices , at Ravensworth Hall , with the air of a person about to indulge in a stroll after eating a good breakfast . But when he was out of sight of the Hall , he quickened his pace , and proceeded somewhat rapidly towards the ruined lodge where he had once before met the Honourable Gilbert Vernon . And it was to meet that very same individual that he now sought the place again . But as Vernon had not yet arrived , Tidkins , after walking round the dilapidated cottage to convince himself that no stranger was near , took a seat upon a pile of bricks , and , producing a cigar - case , was speedily wrapped in the enjoyment of a mild havannah and his own delectable meditations . With the nature of those thoughts we shall not trouble the reader : suffice it to say that they were all connected with the scheme which he and his master were carrying on at Ravensworth Hall , and the last dread act of which was now in immediate contemplation . Tidkins had just lighted a second cigar , when he descried Vernon at a distance . He , however , continued to smoke — for he was not the man to stand upon any ceremony with his employer , even were that employer a prince . "

914381	914431	914371	914371	I	0	" answered Vernon , with difficulty concealing an expression of disgust at the odious familiarity of his agent ; but he had already learnt that crime places the menial upon a footing with the master , and compels the haughty aristocrat to brook the insolence of the vulgar desperado . "
914447	914451	914435	914435	we	24161	" continued Tidkins . "

914599	914603	914594	914595	No one	26771	" replied Vernon . "

914661	914670	914671	914674	some very curious person	24171	" he added , with a jocular chuckle , "

914704	914711	914688	914688	I	0	" said Vernon , somewhat sternly . "

914757	914770	914740	914741	the jugglers	24173	" answered Tidkins , coolly inhaling the fragrant vapour of his cigar . "

914848	914852	914827	914827	You	0	" said Vernon . "
914863	914869	914853	914853	I	0	" replied Tidkins , impatiently . "

914894	914896	914853	914853	I	0	" rejoined Vernon,—"to

915001	915005	914998	914998	we	24181	" remarked Tidkins . "

915075	915079	915912	915912	I	0	" exclaimed Vernon . "
915086	915201	915912	915912	I	0	" The Resurrection Man drew from his pocket a ball covered with coarse blue paper , and nearly as large as a cricket - ball . Then , rising from his seat , he dashed it with some degree of violence upon the hard ground . It exploded in the twinkling of an eye , with a din as loud as that of a blunderbuss ; and both Vernon and the Resurrection Man were immediately enveloped in a dense cloud of black and sulphurous - smelling smoke . When the dark volume had blown away , Vernon beheld the cadaverous countenance of the Resurrection Man looking towards him with a grin of ferocious satisfaction . "
915208	915214	915912	915912	I	0	" cried Tidkins , triumphantly . "
915217	915911	915912	915912	I	0	" answered Gilbert , averting his face — for there was something fiend - like and horrible in the leer of his companion . There was a short pause ; and then those two villains resumed their conversation . But as the remainder of their discourse was connected with the last act of their tragic drama , which we shall be compelled to relate in detail , it is unnecessary to record in this place any more of what passed between them upon the present occasion . After having been nearly an hour together , Gilbert Vernon and the Resurrection Man separated , in order to return by different routes to the Hall . Five minutes after they had left the building , the head of a man looked cautiously over the brink of the empty cistern to which Tidkins had jocularly alluded , and which stood on the top of the least dilapidated portion of the lodge . Seeing that the coast was now perfectly clear , the person who was concealed in the cistern emerged from his hiding - place and let himself drop lightly upon the ground . This individual was the gipsy , Morcar . Being on his way to London,—alone , and upon some business connected with his tribe,—he had stopped to rest himself in those ruins : but he had not been there many minutes , when he heard the sound of footsteps ; and , almost immediately afterwards , he beheld , through a cranny in the wall behind which he was seated , the well - known form and features of the Resurrection Man . His first impulse was to dart upon the miscreant and endeavour to make him his prisoner ; but , seeing that Tidkins looked suspiciously about , Morcar instantly imagined that he had some object in seeking that place . At the same time it struck him , from his knowledge of the Resurrection Man 's character , that this object could be no good one ; and he resolved to watch the villain 's proceedings . Thus , while Tidkins was making the circuit of the ruins , Morcar clambered noiselessly and rapidly up to the cistern , in which he concealed himself . The consequence was , that the gipsy overheard the entire discourse which shortly afterwards ensued between Tidkins and Vernon ; and a scheme of such diabolical villany was thus revealed to him , that his hair almost stood on end as the details of the fearful plot were gradually developed by means of that conversation . When the Resurrection Man and Gilbert Vernon had taken their departure , and Morcar had emerged from his hiding - place , his first impulse was to proceed to Ravensworth Hall and communicate every thing he had overheard to the lady of that mansion . But , ere he took that step , he sate down , with the usual caution which characterises his race , to ponder upon the subject . We have before stated that it is repugnant to the principles of the Zingarees to be instrumental in delivering a criminal over to any justice save their own ; and Morcar knew that if he did adopt such a course , he must necessarily appear as a witness against the two villains whose dark designs he had so strangely discovered . This appearance in a court of justice would sorely damage him with his tribe , over whom he was to rule at his father 's death . It is , however , probable that the excellent effects of Richard Markham 's example upon the generous - hearted Morcar would have hushed those scruples and induced him to do what his good sense told him was his duty towards society , had not the sudden reminiscence of a certain portion of the conversation he had overheard confirmed him in the opinion that he should be acting more prudently to counteract the project of the two villains at the moment it was to be put into execution , rather than deliver them up to justice ere it was attempted . "
915921	915929	915912	915912	I	0	" had one of the miscreants said , "
915957	915985	915986	915987	This man	27445	" The reasoning which these words now engendered in Morcar 's mind , was coincidentally similar to that upon which Eliza Sydney 's conduct had been based . "
915989	915993	915986	915987	This man	27445	" thought Morcar , "
916163	916402	916499	916501	a clever feller	24198	" Having devised a mode of proceeding , Morcar quitted the ruins , and bent his way towards the Three Kings public - house , which was about a mile distant . On his arrival at the little rustic inn , the gipsy sauntered into the tap - room , where he sate down , and ordered some refreshment . At one of the tables five men were busily engaged in devouring bread and cheese and washing down the same with long draughts of Barclay and Perkins 's Treble X. They were thin , but well - made and athletic - looking fellows ; and were dressed in garments of which fustian and corduroy were the principal materials . On the bench near them were several bundles tied up in handkerchiefs , through the openings and holes of which the quick eye of the gipsy caught sight of certain nankin breeches and flesh - coloured stockings , such as are worn by itinerant mountebanks . In a corner of the room stood a large drum , and near it a wicker basket with a lid . Morcar was convinced that these persons were the same to whom Vernon and Tidkins had alluded . His object was now to get into conversation with them ; and this was easily effected by one of those casual remarks upon the weather which invariably commence a discourse between strangers in this country . "
916406	916425	916499	916501	a clever feller	24198	" said the gipsy , after quenching his thirst with half the contents of a pint of porter . "
916430	916437	916499	916501	a clever feller	24198	" replied one of the men . "
916445	916446	916439	916439	you	24196	" "
916450	916454	916439	916439	you	24196	" returned Morcar . "
916462	916469	916455	916455	I	0	" he added with apparent carelessness , "

916483	916490	916455	916455	I	0	" exclaimed another of the jugglers : "

916652	916661	916622	916622	your	24199	" cried one of the men , eagerly , "
916678	916679	916680	916680	I	0	" "
916699	916714	916687	916687	I	0	" said Morcar , still speaking in a careless , indifferent kind of way . "

916743	916753	916737	916737	we	24204	" exclaimed two or three of the men together . "

916832	916833	916853	916854	These figures	24209	" "
916836	916841	916853	916854	These figures	24209	" exclaimed the jugglers . "
916848	916852	916853	916854	These figures	24209	" continued Morcar . "
916879	916880	916853	916854	These figures	24209	" "
916890	916907	916853	916854	These figures	24209	" said one of the men , who began to think the gipsy was bantering them . "
916917	916923	916913	916913	you	0	" answered Morcar , seriously ; "
916964	916965	916948	916948	I	0	" "
916976	916985	916973	916973	you	0	" observed the man who had last spoken , "
917002	917014	916973	916973	you	0	" he added , with a sly glance towards his companions , "
917037	917038	916973	916973	you	0	" "
917049	917053	917047	917047	myself	0	" cried Morcar . "

917081	917091	917073	917073	you	0	" interrupted the spokesman of the party of jugglers ; "

917137	917141	917121	917121	you	0	" replied Morcar : "

917173	917178	917179	917179	you	0	" cried the man : "

917247	917251	917253	917253	I	0	" answered Morcar ; "
917258	917359	917253	917253	I	0	" The five jugglers , who were evidently much delighted at the prospect of securing so valuable an addition to their troop , consulted together in whispers for a short period , while Morcar hummed a tune as if perfectly indifferent whether a bargain were concluded or not . The men did not fail to remark his free and off - hand manner , and took it as an unquestionable proof of his confidence in the value of his invention and the success which must attend upon its exhibition . They therefore resolved to enlist him on almost any terms . "
917362	917378	917253	917253	I	0	" said the spokesman of the party , at length turning towards Morcar once more , "
917397	917398	917253	917253	I	0	" "
917406	917410	917253	917253	I	0	" replied Morcar : "
917419	917420	917413	917413	us	24218	" "
917425	917882	917413	917413	us	24218	" added one of the jugglers , who , as the gipsy subsequently discovered , was the musician of the party — his instrumental harmony being composed of the huge drum and a set of Pandean pipes , vulgarly called a mouth - organ . The process of shaking hands all round and of imbibing more strong beer was then gone through ; after which the jugglers became very anxious to see the marvellous net that was to make their fortunes . They were , therefore , somewhat disappointed when Morcar informed them that one of the tribe had conveyed it to London in his cart the day before ; but their elongating countenances expanded once more into smiles of satisfaction when he assured them that he would instantly set off after it , and be with them again at least an hour previously to the time when they intended to visit the mansion in the neighbourhood . Matters being thus arranged , Morcar took his departure — rejoiced at the success of his project , though somewhat annoyed at having been compelled to utter so many falsehoods to the credulous jugglers . But this vexation was speedily dissipated by the remembrance of the important duty which he had undertaken ; and he moreover intended to make the poor fellows a handsome recompense for the disappointment they were destined to experience relative to the wonderful net . It is not necessary to follow the gipsy 's footsteps to the metropolis , and back to the Three Kings again : suffice it to say that he made his appearance at the little public - house shortly after six o'clock in the evening — much to the joy of the five jugglers , who began to imagine that he had been hoaxing them . But all their suspicions vanished when they beheld the gipsy return , with an iron rod , as long as a hop - pole , and round which the magic net was rolled , over his shoulder . This rod was not much thicker than the thumb , but the bulk of the burden was considerably increased by the folds of the net . And at that net did the jugglers stare with such eager eyes , that Morcar could hardly contain his laughter : for the net was nothing more than a common one of the very largest size , such as poachers use to drag canals and small rivers . It was , however , very strong , and when stretched out would cover a room eighteen feet long , by twelve in width . The iron rod was about thirteen feet long , and the net was rolled round it breadthways . "
917897	917904	917883	917883	You	24219	" said one of the jugglers . "
917921	917925	917918	917918	you	24219	" returned Morcar . "

918029	918037	918027	918027	Mike	1105	" said the musician of the troop . "

918246	918256	918261	918261	myself	0	" demanded Mike , with mingled satisfaction and astonishment . "
918265	918284	918261	918261	myself	0	" answered Morcar , taking a huge red wig from one pocket and a hideous mask from another ; "
918301	918302	918324	918324	they	24228	" "
918307	918311	918324	918324	they	24228	" observed Mike . "
918327	918480	918324	918324	they	24228	" The jugglers were now in high spirits ; and they speedily addressed themselves to the process of changing their common apparel for the professional costume . The evening was serene and beautiful . A few thin vapours floated lazily through the blue arch , the hue of which was deliciously mellowed by the golden light of the sun . It was about seven o'clock ; and the principal inmates of Ravensworth Hall were collected in the drawing - room . Adeline , pale , emaciated , and care - worn , was reclining upon the sofa ; and near her sate Eliza Sydney . The nurse was walking up and down the apartment , with the infant heir in her arms . Gilbert Vernon was standing outside the window , on a spacious balcony , around which were placed green wooden boxes and garden - pots containing shrubs and early flowers . "
918487	918499	918324	918324	they	24228	" said Eliza , in a low tone , to Adeline : "

918556	918565	918549	918549	I	0	" answered Adeline , mournfully — very mournfully . "

918624	918628	918619	918619	lady	8723	" interrupted Eliza . "

918646	918650	918629	918630	Mr. Vernon	1679	" returned Adeline ; "

918700	918706	918679	918679	he	1679	" said Eliza , earnestly . "
918718	918743	918744	918744	Vernon	1679	" she continued , sinking her voice to a scarcely audible whisper , as she leant over the unhappy lady whom she thus addressed . "
918761	918762	918766	918766	he	1679	" "
918774	918778	918766	918766	he	1679	" asked Adeline . "
918858	918859	918860	918860	Habit	1813	" "
918872	918877	918860	918860	Habit	1813	" replied Eliza Sydney . "

919095	919100	919086	919086	I	0	" answered Lady Ravensworth : "

919202	919223	919193	919193	I	0	" answered Eliza , with a profound sigh ; for she pitied — deeply pitied the wretched but criminal woman : "
919317	919318	919321	919321	his	3239	" "
919324	919330	919321	919321	his	3239	" said Adeline , anxiously . "
919362	919389	919332	919332	I	0	" Eliza Sydney was suddenly interrupted by an exclamation which came from the lips of Gilbert Vernon . She rose , and hastened to the window . "
919411	919415	919392	919404	a troop of poor fellows who doubtless endeavour to earn an honest penny	24260	" said Vernon ; "
919436	919798	919799	919800	These conjurors	24262	" Had not Eliza Sydney 's curiosity been at the moment attracted by the strange appearance of the corps of mountebanks to whom Vernon alluded , and who were advancing towards the Hall , she would have been struck with surprise at the emanation of such generous sentiments from so cold - hearted , austere , and aristocratic a person as he . But her attention was for the time directed towards six persons , five of whom were clad in the light grotesque manner in which mountebanks appear at country - fairs , and even not unfrequently in the streets of London . They wore flesh - coloured stockings , nankin breeches , and jackets of variegated colours , as if , in respect to this latter article of their apparel , they attempted to vie with the peculiar costume of world - renowned Harlequin . The sixth was dressed in a common garb , and wore a hideous mask . One of the jugglers carried an enormous drum slung behind his back , and had a set of Pandean pipes tucked in his neckcloth beneath his chin ; and another was laden with a wicker - basket . The man who was dressed in the common garb and wore the mask , bore a long rod with a net twisted round it , upon his shoulder . A fourth carried two stout stakes ; and the remaining two were empty - handed , although it was evident by their dress that they took no small share in the performances which itinerant mountebanks and conjurors of this kind are in the habit of exhibiting . We must observe , in respect to the man who wore the mask , and who , as the reader already knows , was the gipsy Morcar , that beneath his ample straw hat , and over the edges of the mask , projected huge bushes of reddish - yellow hair , which seemed as if they had once belonged to a door - mat . He walked , a little apart from the others , in company with the man who carried the stakes . "
919812	919826	919799	919800	These conjurors	24262	" said Eliza Sydney , as the men drew nearer to the house . "
919859	919860	919866	919867	Mrs. Beaufort	1806	" "
919869	919873	919866	919867	Mrs. Beaufort	1806	" returned Vernon . "
919936	919937	919938	919938	I	0	" "
919956	919960	919938	919938	I	0	" answered Eliza : "
919964	919965	919938	919938	I	0	" "
919973	919977	919938	919938	I	0	" interrupted Vernon , "
920042	920089	920035	920036	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" Eliza scarcely knew how to offer any farther objection : she was , however , about to make some remark in answer to Mr. Vernon , when the point at issue was settled by that gentleman beckoning the foremost mountebank to advance under the window . "
920096	920115	920035	920036	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" he exclaimed , looking over the parapet of the balcony , and tossing the man a sovereign , "
920126	920127	920035	920036	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" "
920132	920146	920130	920130	sir	26649	" cried the man , receiving the money in his straw - hat . "
920161	920519	920521	920521	he	24278	" He then returned to his companions , who had stationed themselves at a short distance on the lawn . The mountebanks forthwith commenced their preparations . The wicker - basket was placed upon the ground ; and its contents were speedily disposed in a manner to suit the performances . A long rope was tied to two trees of about twenty yards ' distance from each other : some common blue plates and a wash - hand basin were laid upon the grass ; and then a number of small yellow balls were ranged in a line , and at short intervals apart , across the lawn . While some of the men were making these arrangements , Morcar and his companion advanced to within a short distance of the balcony , and drove the two stakes firmly into the ground . To the tops of these stakes they fastened the ends of the iron rod , without however unrolling the net , but in such a manner that the rod itself would revolve with ease , and the entire net might be drawn out in a moment . They then took their posts each by one of the stakes , and there remained motionless . In the meantime the man with the drum and the mouth - organ had commenced his instrumental harmony , such as it was ; and , at the sound , the servants of the Hall flocked from their offices to the steps of the entrance , well pleased to observe that the monotony of their existence in a dwelling where no company was now received , was about to be broken by even the performances of a few wandering mountebanks . In the drawing - room , Vernon was still stationed at the balcony ; and the nurse , holding the sleeping child in her arms , had approached the open window outside of which Vernon was thus standing . Eliza Sydney had returned to the side of Lady Ravensworth , to whom she mentioned the presence of the mountebanks and the encouragement which they had received from Mr. Vernon . "
920537	920548	920521	920521	he	24278	" said Adeline , her lip curling with contemptuous hauteur . "
920572	920573	920521	920521	he	24278	" "
920586	920655	920579	920579	our	24279	" returned Eliza . Lady Ravensworth was about to reply , when Quentin entered the room and placed a letter in Eliza 's hands . The valet then withdrew . Eliza immediately recognised the writing of the faithful Filippo , and opened it in haste . Her countenance evinced signs of satisfaction as she perused its contents ; but ere she reached the end , she sighed deeply . "
920662	920676	920656	920656	You	24280	" whispered Lady Ravensworth , who had attentively watched her friend 's countenance . "
920686	920687	920688	920688	I	0	" "
920691	920701	920688	920688	I	0	" answered Eliza , also in a low tone , "
920721	920728	920688	920688	I	0	villain"—glancing towards the window as she thus spoke—"is
920736	920737	920688	920688	I	0	" "
920747	920753	920740	920741	your messenger	39819	" said Adeline , joyfully . "
920759	920760	920740	920741	your messenger	39819	" "
920787	920791	920783	920783	his	27403	" answered Eliza . "
920806	921135	920783	920783	his	27403	" Adeline became red as scarlet , and a profound sigh escaped her bosom;—for was she not also a disgrace to human nature ? Eliza forgot at the moment that her words were calculated to wound the already deeply lacerated heart of Lady Ravensworth;—else not for a moment — criminal as Adeline was — would those words have escaped her tongue . Neither did she perceive the acute emotions which she had awakened ; for she was intent upon the reflections excited by the arrival of Filippo 's letter . In the meantime the sports upon the lawn had commenced . One of the mountebanks ascended to the tightrope , and performed many curious evolutions , much to the amusement not only of the servants assembled upon the steps at the entrance , but even of the nurse at the window . When the dancing was over , a second juggler balanced first a blue plate , and then the basin , on the point of a long stick — making them spin rapidly round , to the especial delight of the female servants . The nurse , too , was so very much amused that she crossed the threshold of the window , and advanced a little upon the balcony , the better to view the performance . Vernon seemed intent upon the sports , and did not appear to notice that the ladies were not spectators also . But perhaps he might have thought that they were at another window . And all this while Morcar , with his mask and bushy yellow hair , and his assistant Mike , were stationed each by one of the stakes to which the net was fixed . From time to time Vernon had looked over the balcony at these two men , whose presence there seemed somewhat to annoy him : and when the exhibition of the plates and basin was over , he leant forward , exclaiming , "
921162	921163	921164	921164	You	0	" "
921171	921175	921164	921164	You	0	" replied Morcar . "
921193	921194	921187	921187	I	0	" "
921200	921206	921187	921187	I	0	" thought Vernon to himself . "
921252	921524	921187	921187	I	0	" Such were the rapid reflections which passed through Vernon 's brain . And had searching eyes been fixed upon his countenance now , they would have observed that although he seemed to watch the sports with a zest passing strange in a man of his years , there were far more important matters agitating in his brain;—for his face was pale — his lips quivered from time to time — and , even while his head remained stationary as if he were looking straight towards the lawn , his eyes were wild and wandering . Amidst the servants on the steps of the entrance stood the Resurrection Man , apparently one of the most enthusiastic admirers of the sport . But he — as well as his employer in the balcony — was somewhat annoyed when he beheld the iron rod and the net which was rolled round it , placed upon the stakes on the verge of the lawn almost beneath the open window of the drawing - room . Another circumstance likewise engaged his attention . This was that he had only seen five jugglers when he had first hired them for the performances ; whereas there were now six present . He , however , consoled himself with the idea that the man in the mask and his companion had taken their station so near the balcony , simply because their exhibition , whatever it was , should be better viewed by the inmates of the drawing - room ; and relative to the presence of the sixth juggler , he said to himself upon second thoughts , "
921546	921753	921754	921754	I	0	" But to continue the thread of our narrative . The last beams of the setting sun were flickering faintly in the western horizon , when the jugglers commenced what may be termed the third act of their performances — namely , the athletic exercises . They had wrestling matches , took extraordinary leaps , and performed various other feats of strength and skill . These being over , one of the band threw himself back , supporting himself with his hands on the ground , and in this position ran on all fours along the line of yellow balls , picking them up with his mouth , one after the other , with astonishing rapidity . This feat elicited a burst of applause from the servants on the steps ; and the nurse , still holding the child in her arms , advanced close up to the parapet of the balcony . The sun had already set when that last feat began : the twilight was , however , sufficiently strong to permit the spectators to obtain a good view of the performance . But the jugglers now paused for a few minutes to rest themselves ; and during that interval the duskiness sensibly increased . "
921770	921774	921754	921754	I	0	" observed Vernon . "
921783	921926	921927	921928	The child	30315	" The nurse looked over the parapet to see whether the man in the mask and his companion were still stationed near their apparatus , the use of which puzzled her amazingly . At that moment two of the jugglers who had advanced from the lawn towards the flag - stones that skirted the wall of the mansion , threw each a detonating - ball upon the pavement . The explosion was loud — abrupt — startling ; and a volume of dense smoke instantly burst as it were from the ground , enveloping the balcony , and pouring even into the drawing - room through the open window . And , almost at the same instant that the explosion took place , a terrible scream pierced the air ; and this was followed by agonising shrieks , mingled with frantic cries of "
921933	921934	921927	921928	The child	30315	" "
921938	921977	921978	921978	child	36802	" ejaculated Eliza Sydney , rushing from her seat near Lady Adeline to the window . But she was met by the nurse , who darted in from the balcony , clasping her hands together , and still screaming wildly—"The
921983	921984	921980	921981	the child	30315	" "
921988	921998	921985	921986	Holy God	1815	" cried Vernon , also rushing into the room : "
922014	922029	922030	922030	Murderer!—vile	24297	" And he sank upon a chair , as if overcome by his grief . "
922035	922040	922030	922030	Murderer!—vile	24297	" exclaimed Eliza Sydney : "
922046	922047	922048	922048	Madam	26758	" "
922050	922059	922048	922048	Madam	26758	" cried Vernon , starting from his seat , "
922073	922074	922065	922065	I	0	" "
922088	922122	922077	922077	I	0	" ejaculated Eliza , as she forced the nurse , who was raving violently , to a sofa . At that moment shouts of delight were heard from below ; and loud cries of "
922127	922164	922077	922077	I	0	" reached all the inmates of the drawing - room — save Lady Ravensworth , who had fainted the instant the first wild scream of the nurse had struck her ears like a death - omen . "
922169	922195	922303	922303	God	1815	" repeated the nurse , catching at the joyous sound , and now becoming hysterical with the effects of the revulsion of emotions thereby produced . "
922204	922264	922303	922303	God	1815	" cried Eliza Sydney , darting towards the balcony ; but it was now too dark to distinguish any thing that was passing below . Her suspense did not , however , endure many moments longer ; for the door of the drawing - room was suddenly thrown open , and the man in the mask rushed in , crying "
922269	922301	922303	922303	God	1815	" Eliza Sydney hastened to meet him , and received the child in her arms . The little innocent was indeed unhurt , to all appearance , but was crying bitterly . "
922308	922348	922306	922306	God	1815	" exclaimed Eliza , fervently , as she pressed the child to her bosom . Quentin now made his appearance with lights : and several of the servants had followed him as far as the door of the room . "
922361	922367	922368	922368	she	6519	" said Eliza , hastily : "
922385	922430	922431	922431	My	0	" The lady's - maid was close by ; and , hastening into the room , she devoted the necessary attentions to Adeline , who , soon recovering , opened her eyes , gazed wildly around , and then exclaimed in a frantic tone , "
922437	922438	922431	922431	My	0	" "
922450	922466	922447	922448	dear lady	24306	" said Eliza Sydney , advancing towards the sofa with the babe in her arms . "
922486	922618	922447	922448	dear lady	24306	" cried Adeline in a shrieking tone : then , receiving the infant from her friend , she clasped it with frantic fondness to her bosom . In the meantime — although this scene occupied but a few minutes — Gilbert Vernon had sunk upon a chair , like one intoxicated . A film came over his eyes — his brain reeled — and he could not accurately distinguish what was passing around him . Amidst the sudden chaos into which his ideas were plunged , one thought was alone clear — defined — and unobscured ; and this was that the child was saved ! The moment Eliza Sidney had consigned the heir of Ravensworth to the arms of his mother , she said in a hasty whisper to Quentin , "
922631	922652	922447	922448	dear lady	24306	" The valet quitted the room ; and Eliza then advanced towards Gilbert Vernon , exclaiming in a loud tone , "
922691	922728	922682	922682	he	24309	" As these words , uttered with terrible emphasis , fell upon the ears of the servants , a cry of horror and execration burst from their lips ; and Vernon , starting up , exclaimed , "
922745	922781	922735	922735	you	1816	" But the next moment he was pinioned by a pair of powerful arms ; for Morcar , who had hastily thrown off his mask and wig , was prepared to secure the guilty man . "
922787	922815	922785	922785	villain	3446	" cried Vernon , struggling furiously — but without avail ; for some of the male domestics of the household now assisted the gipsy to retain him . "
922844	922845	922846	922846	I	0	" "
922848	922855	922857	922857	I	0	" answered Eliza Sydney , boldly . "
922860	922864	922868	922868	I	0	" echoed Morcar . "
922874	922882	922871	922872	murderous wretch	24315	" exclaimed the nurse , stepping forward . "
922889	922904	922871	922872	murderous wretch	24315	" cried Vernon , ceasing to struggle , and sinking back into the chair . "
922933	922934	922922	922922	you	24316	" "
922941	922948	922922	922922	you	24316	" ejaculated the nurse , vehemently . "
923005	923071	923072	923073	That woman	27898	" A second burst of indignation on the part of the servants struck terror to the heart of the guilty wretch , who writhed upon his chair ; while the workings of his ashy pale countenance — the convulsive movements of his lips — and the wild rolling of his eyes , were terrible — terrible ! Nevertheless he mustered up courage sufficient to exclaim , "
923091	923092	923093	923093	She	27898	" "
923102	923106	923093	923093	She	27898	" cried Eliza . "
923138	923139	923140	923140	You	0	" "
923142	923161	923140	923140	You	0	" said Vernon , quailing beneath the indignant glance of abhorrence which the royal widow fixed upon him . "
923164	923168	923140	923140	You	0	" she continued : "
923256	923257	923246	923246	I	0	" "
923266	923270	923246	923246	I	0	" cried Vernon . "
923279	923283	923284	923284	I	0	" returned Eliza . "
923291	923292	923294	923294	I	0	" "
923300	923306	923294	923294	I	0	" said Gilbert , violently . "
923311	923315	923316	923316	You	24326	" resumed Eliza . "
923352	923353	923344	923344	your	24326	" "
923362	923366	923368	923369	your landlady	42510	" exclaimed Vernon . "
923384	923388	923389	923389	Monster	1727	" added Eliza . "
923391	923403	923389	923389	Monster	1727	" ejaculated one of the servants who had hold upon him . "
923409	923415	923389	923389	Monster	1727	" cried Vernon , furiously . "
923427	923435	923420	923420	you	24326	" said Eliza , with bitter emphasis . "
923469	923470	923457	923462	All the inmates of the household	24338	" "
923479	923483	923472	923472	I	0	" returned Eliza ; "
923516	923517	923501	923505	the ablest chemists in England	24340	" "
923548	923553	923554	923554	You	24326	" cried Gilbert Vernon . "
923564	923570	923554	923554	You	24326	" said Eliza , calmly , "
923694	923695	923679	923679	you	24326	" "
923723	923727	923699	923699	you	24326	" demanded Vernon . "
923752	923753	923755	923755	you	24326	" "
923760	923764	923755	923755	you	24326	" answered Eliza ; "
923877	923906	923873	923875	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Vernon shuddered fearfully as these words fell upon his ears ; for it seemed as if a sledge - hammer had been suddenly struck upon his brain . "
923917	923921	923873	923875	the Resurrection Man	3220	" said Morcar , "
924064	924065	924066	924067	Excellent man	11225	" "
924069	924085	924066	924067	Excellent man	11225	" exclaimed Eliza Sydney , while a murmur of applause passed amongst the assembled servants : "
924095	924096	924097	924097	I	0	" "
924109	924114	924107	924107	madam	26758	" was the answer : "
924121	924122	924123	924123	Morcar	1364	" "
924125	924129	924123	924123	Morcar	1364	" echoed Eliza . "
924171	924172	924123	924123	Morcar	1364	" "
924179	924220	924123	924123	Morcar	1364	" cried Morcar , who for some moments had been studying Eliza 's features with attention — for he had seen many portraits of her during his sojourn in Italy , and a light now broke in upon his memory : "
924273	924298	924301	924301	Morcar	1364	" And , as he spoke , Morcar abandoned his hold upon Gilbert Vernon , and fell upon his knees before the royal widow . "
924303	924308	924301	924301	Morcar	1364	" she hastily exclaimed : "
924348	924349	924353	924353	Morcar	1364	" "
924363	924373	924353	924353	Morcar	1364	" returned the gipsy , proudly and yet respectfully ; "
924387	924820	924353	924353	Morcar	1364	" At that moment a cry of alarm burst from the servants who had still retained their hold upon Vernon ; and at the same instant this guilty man sprang furiously from their grasp — hurled them violently aside — and , ere a single hand could stop his mad career , rushed to the window . Morcar bounded after him : but it was too late . Gilbert Vernon had precipitated himself from the balcony ! The sound of his fall upon the pavement beneath,—and the sound of a human being thus falling has none other like it in the world,—struck upon every ear in that drawing - room . Some of the servants hastened down stairs , and ran to the spot where Vernon lay . They raised him — they bore him into the hall ; but the moment the light of the lamps fell upon him , they perceived that all human aid was unavailing . His skull was literally beaten in , and his hair was covered with his blood and brains ! Thus did he meet the fate which he had all along intended for his infant nephew . Terrible suicide — but just retribution ! Half an hour after this dread event a travelling carriage rolled rapidly away from Ravensworth Hall . In it were seated Adeline , with her child upon her lap , her lady's - maid , and the nurse . The faithful Quentin , who had been induced by the persuasion of Eliza Sydney to remain in the service of Lady Ravensworth , occupied the dickey behind the vehicle . Adeline was now on her way to Dover , whence she purposed to pass to the continent ; her intention being , in pursuance of the advice of Eliza , to seek some retired spot in the south of France , where she might at least find tranquillity and repose , if not happiness , after the rude storms to which she had lately been so fearfully exposed . Not that this self - expatriation was compulsory on account of Lady Ravensworth 's one dread crime : it was nevertheless the project to which we have before alluded , and by which means Eliza had planned that Adeline should escape from the consequences of any revelation that might be made by the Resurrection Man in respect to the murdered Lydia Hutchinson . But no such revelation was made , inasmuch as Tidkins had disappeared from the mansion ere Quentin received the order to secure him . For the instant the cry of "
924825	926316	926317	926317	Cuffin	873	" fell upon the ears of the Resurrection Man and conveyed to him the stunning fact that the scheme had failed — that the child had escaped , in some marvellous manner , the fate intended for it,—then did he know full well that Ravensworth Hall was no longer the place for him . Reckless of what might become of Vernon , and unnoticed by the servants amidst the confusion which prevailed immediately after the fall of the child from the balcony , Tidkins slipped out of the mansion by the back way , and was speedily beyond the reach of danger . Thus terminated that terrible series of incidents which constitute so strange an episode in the annals of the family of Ravensworth . But ere Adeline took her departure from the mansion of that noble race whose name she bore , she had learnt , with surprise and joy , that the excellent friend whom heaven had sent her , and by whose touching language and admirable example her own heart had been brought to a state of sincere and profound penitence,—she had learnt , we say , that this noble - hearted woman was one whose brow a diadem had lately graced ! We may also observe that Morcar refused the liberal recompense which both Adeline and Eliza proffered him for the most important service which he had rendered in defeating Vernon 's plan at a moment when , in spite of all the precautions and the various measures adopted by Eliza , it seemed to touch upon the verge of a success fatal to the existence of the infant heir . Satisfied with the approval of his own conscience , and attended by the blessings of a mother whose child he had saved , Morcar returned with the jugglers to the Three Kings , where he completely satisfied them for the disappointment they had experienced in respect to the wondrous properties of his net ; and on the ensuing morning he parted from them , to pursue his own way . Eliza Sydney passed the night at Ravensworth Hall ; and , after the Coroner 's Inquest had sate next day upon the body of the suicide Vernon , she returned to her peaceful villa at Clapton . As the Resurrection Man hurried through the fields , amidst the darkness of the night , he vented in horrible imprecations the rage he experienced at the failure of a scheme to which he had devoted so much time and trouble . He knew that the blank acceptance which he had extorted from Vernon , and which he had looked upon as the safe guarantee of the speedy acquisition of three thousand pounds , was now but a valueless slip of paper ; and he cursed himself for having been foolish enough to advance some two or three hundred guineas of his own money to furnish his late employer with the supplies necessary for his purposes . But as a set - off against these disappointments he had one consolation — a consolation which to a less avaricious mind would have been more than commensurate with the losses that Tidkins deplored . He was possessed of Lady Ravensworth 's valuable casket of jewels , which he had removed , a few days after he had obtained it in the manner already described , to his house in Globe Town . And it was to this den that he was now repairing . He was as yet unacquainted with the fate of Gilbert Vernon ; but , supposing it probable that justice might already have that individual in his grasp , he at once determined to provide for his own safety . Abandoning , therefore , all his long - nourished schemes of vengeance against the Prince of Montoni , the Rattlesnake , and Crankey Jem , Tidkins was now intent only on securing his treasure , and taking his departure for America with the least possible delay . It was about two o'clock in the morning when the Resurrection Man , sinking with the fatigues of his long and circuitous journey round all the northern outskirts of London , arrived at his own house . Wearied as he was , he wasted no time in snatching a temporary repose : a glass of spirits recruited his strength and invigorated his energies ; and , with his bunch of keys in his hand , he repaired from his own chamber to the rooms on the ground - floor . It will be remembered that on a former occasion,—on his return home , in the middle of the month of March , after his escape from the Middlesex House of Correction,—the Resurrection Man had perceived certain indications which led him to imagine that the step of an intruder had visited the ground - floor and the subterranean part of his house . His suspicions had fallen upon Banks ; but an interview with this individual convinced him that those suspicions were unfounded ; for although he did not question him point - blank upon the subject , yet his penetration was such , that he could judge of the real truth by the undertaker 's manner . Since that period Tidkins had visited his house in Globe Town on several occasions — indeed , as often as he could possibly get away from Ravensworth Hall for the greater portion of a day ; and , perceiving no farther indications of the intrusion of a stranger , he became confirmed in the belief which had succeeded his first suspicions , and which was that he had been influenced by groundless alarms . But now , the moment he put the key into the lock of the door in the alley , he uttered a terrible imprecation — for the key would not turn , and there was evidently something in the lock ! Hastily picking the lock with one of those wire - instruments which are used for the purpose by burglars , he extracted from it a piece of a key which had broken in the wards . Fearful was now the rage of the Resurrection Man ; and when he had succeeded in opening the door , he precipitated himself madly into that department of his abode . But what pen can describe his savage fury , when , upon lighting a lantern , he saw the trap raised , and the brick removed from the place in the chimney where it covered the secret means of raising the hearth - stone ? Plunging desperately down into the subterranean , at the risk of breaking his neck , Tidkins felt like one on whose eyes a hideous spectre suddenly bursts , when he beheld the door of a cell — the very cell in which his treasure was concealed — standing wide open ! Staggering now , as a drunken man — and no longer rushing wildly along,—but dragging himself painfully,—Tidkins reached that cell . His worst fears were confirmed : the stone in the centre was removed from its place;—and his treasure was gone ! Yes:—money - bags and jewel - casket — the produce of heaven only knows how much atrocity and blackest crime — had disappeared . This was the second time that his hoarded wealth was snatched from him . Then did that man — so energetic in the ways of turpitude , so strong in the stormy paths of guilt,—then did he sink down , with a hollow groan , upon the cold floor of the cell . For a few minutes he lay like one deprived of sense and feeling , the only indications of life being the violent clenching of his fists , and the demoniac workings of his cadaverous countenance . Cadaverous!—never did the face of a wretched being in the agonies of strangulation by hanging , present so appalling — so hideous an appearance ! But in a short time the Resurrection Man started up with a savage howl and a terrible imprecation : his energies — prostrated for a period — revived ; and his first idea , when arousing from that torpor , was vengeance — a fearful vengeance upon the plunderer . But who was that plunderer ? whose hand had suddenly beggared him ? His suspicions instantly fixed themselves upon two persons — the only two of his accomplices who were acquainted with the mysteries of the subterranean . These were Banks and the Buffer . He was about to turn from the cell , and repair forthwith — even at that hour — to the dwelling of the undertaker , when his eyes suddenly fell upon some letters scrawled in chalk upon the pavement , and which the position of the lantern had hitherto prevented him from observing . He stooped down , and read the words—"James
926319	926359	926317	926317	Cuffin	873	" The mystery was solved : his mortal enemy , Crankey Jem , had robbed him of his treasure ! Dark — terribly ominous and foreboding — was now the cloud which overspread the countenance of the Resurrection Man . "
926370	926383	926384	926384	I	0	" he muttered to himself , with a hyena - like growl , "
926437	926639	926427	926429	the Bully Grand	1635	" With these words,—and now displaying that outward calmness which often covers the most intensely concentrated rage,—the Resurrection Man quitted the subterranean , carefully securing the doors behind him . He purposely broke a key in the lock of the door leading into the dark alley , so as to prevent the intrusion of any of the neighbours , should their curiosity tempt them to visit the place ; for he made up his mind not to return thither again so long as Jem Cuffin was alive and able to betray him . Having provided himself with a few necessaries , he closed the up - stairs rooms , and then took his departure . He bent his steps towards the house of the undertaker in Globe Lane ; and , knocking him up , obtained admittance and a bed . When he awoke from a sound sleep , into which sheer fatigue plunged him in spite of the unpleasant nature of his thoughts , it was broad - day - light . He immediately rose and despatched one of Banks 's boys for the morning newspaper ; and from its columns he learnt the fate of the Honourable Gilbert Vernon . "
926669	926675	926654	926659	these sentimental humbugs in high life	24383	" murmured Tidkins to himself . "
926715	927215	926711	926713	scoundrel Crankey Jem	873	" Twenty months had elapsed since the events just related . It was now the end of January , 1843 . Haply the reader may begin to imagine that our subject is well - nigh exhausted — that the mysteries of London are nearly all unveiled ? He errs ; for London is a city containing such a variety of strange institutions , private as well as public , and presenting so many remarkable phases to the contemplation of the acute observer , that the writer who is resolved to avail himself fully of the heterogeneous materials thus supplied him , can not readily lack food for comment and narrative . The dwellers in the country , and even the inhabitants of the great provincial cities and manufacturing towns , can form no just estimate of the wondrous features of the sovereign metropolis by the local scenes with which they are familiar . Who can judge of the splendour of the West End of London by even the most fashionable quarters of Edinburgh or Dublin ? Who can conceive the amount of revolting squalor and hideous penury existing in the poor districts of London , by a knowledge of the worst portions of Liverpool or Manchester ? Who can form a conjecture of the dreadful immorality and shocking vice of the low neighbourhoods of London , judging by the scenes presented to view in the great mining or manufacturing counties ? No:—for all that is most gorgeous and beautiful , as well as all that is most filthy and revolting,—all that is best of talent , or most degraded of ignorance,—all that is most admirable for virtue , or most detestable for crime,—all that is most refined in elegance , or most strange in barbarism,—all , all these wondrous phases are to be found , greatest in glory , or lowest in infamy , in the imperial city of the British Isles ! And shall we be charged with vanity , if we declare that never until now has the veil been so rudely torn aside , nor the corruptions of London been so boldly laid bare ? But , in undertaking this work , we were determined at the outset to be daunted by no fear of offending the high and the powerful : we were resolved to misrepresent nothing for the purpose of securing to ourselves the favour of those whom so many sycophants delight to bespatter with their sickly praises . In the same independent spirit do we now pursue our narrative . On the left - hand side of Brydges Street , as you proceed from the Strand towards Russell Street , Covent Garden , you may perceive a lamp projecting over the door of an establishment which , viewed externally , appears to be a modest eating - house ; but which in reality is one of the most remarkable places of nocturnal entertainment in London . Upon the lamp alluded to are painted these words——"The
927218	927483	927484	927509	gentlemen " who either turn night into day , or who make up for the toils of the day by the dissipated enjoyments of the night	48586	" It was past midnight , towards the end of January , 1843 , when two gentlemen , wearing fashionable Taglioni coats over their elegant attire , and impregnating the fine frosty air with the vapour of their cigars , strolled into this establishment . Proceeding down a passage , they pushed open a door with a painted ground - glass window , and entered a spacious supper - room . This apartment was lofty , handsomely fitted up , well furnished , and provided with boxes containing little tables , like the coffee - room of an hotel . A cheerful fire burnt in the grate , and the numerous lights suspended around the apartment were reflected in a handsome mirror over the mantel - piece . Above the door leading into the room was a species of gallery , forming a grotto - like opening into a suite of upper apartments , which were reached by a flight of stairs leading from the passage just now mentioned . All was gaiety and bustle both in the coffee - room below and the chambers above . Numerous suppers were in progress , the partakers thereof consisting of gentlemen of various descriptions and gay ladies of only one particular class . Oysters , lobsters , cold fowls , ham , and kidneys , constituted the principal edibles ; while liquor flowed copiously and in all gradations of luxury , from humble porter in pewter pots to sparkling champagne in green bottles . The male portion of the guests was composed of those various specimens of "
927485	927609	927610	927611	her friend	30560	" who either turn night into day , or who make up for the toils of the day by the dissipated enjoyments of the night . There was an attorney 's clerk , who , having picked up a stray guinea in a manner for which he would not perhaps have liked to account , was doing the liberal , in the shape of oysters , stout , and hot brandy - and - water , to some fair Cyprian whom he had never seen before , and whom he would perhaps never see again , but with whom he was on the very best possible terms for the time being ; the only trifling damper to his enjoyment being her constant anxiety lest "
927612	927766	927484	927509	gentlemen " who either turn night into day , or who make up for the toils of the day by the dissipated enjoyments of the night	48586	" should happen to come in and catch her at supper with the said attorney 's clerk . There was a notorious black - leg , who was regaling a couple of frail ones with champagne and looking out for flats as well ; while his accomplice was doing precisely the same in the next box,—both these respectable gentlemen affecting to be total strangers to each other . There also was a handsome young man , who , having just come of age , and stepped into the possession of a good property , was commencing his career of waste and extravagance at the Paradise . Proud of the nauseating flattery of the three or four abandoned women who had him in tow , he was literally throwing about his money in all directions , and staring around him with the vacant air of semi - intoxication , as much as to say , "
927779	927993	927769	927769	you	24387	" In another box was an old man , who had reached the wrong side of sixty , but who was endeavouring to make a young girl of seventeen believe that he was but forty - four last birth - day,—a tale which she had too much tact to appear to doubt for a moment , as the antiquated beau supplied her with copious draughts of champagne to enable her to swallow the lie the more easily . A little farther on was a dandified , stiff - necked , coxcomical individual of about six - and - twenty , sipping sherry with a fair friend , and endeavouring to render himself as polite and agreeable as possible . But , at every word he spoke , he drew out the edge of the table - cloth to precisely the extent of a yard between his fore - fingers and thumbs;—whereby it was easy to perceive that , although he assured his companion he was a captain in the Guards , he in reality exercised the less conspicuous but more active employment of a linen - draper 's assistant . Crowding near the fire were several Cyprians , who had not as yet obtained cavaliers , and were therefore hovering between the alternatives of "
927995	927997	927484	927509	gentlemen " who either turn night into day , or who make up for the toils of the day by the dissipated enjoyments of the night	48586	" or "
928001	928175	927484	927509	gentlemen " who either turn night into day , or who make up for the toils of the day by the dissipated enjoyments of the night	48586	" the odds being , to all appearances , in favour of the latter . They did not , however , seem very unhappy while their fate , as to oysters and stout , was pending in the balance of suspense ; but laughed , chattered , and larked amongst themselves ; and then , by way of avoiding any thing like monotony or sameness in their recreation , two of them got up a pleasant little quarrel which terminated in a brisk exchange of blows and scratches . Leaning over the side of the grotto - like gallery before referred to , were two individuals , whose appearance was something between that of dissipated actors and broken down tradesmen ; and who were so disguised in liquor that their own mothers could scarcely have recognised them . Being most probably wearied of their own conversation , they diverted themselves by addressing their remarks to the people in the coffee - room below , whom they invited in the most condescending manner possible to "
928179	928180	927484	927509	gentlemen " who either turn night into day , or who make up for the toils of the day by the dissipated enjoyments of the night	48586	" "
928185	928186	927484	927509	gentlemen " who either turn night into day , or who make up for the toils of the day by the dissipated enjoyments of the night	48586	" "
928191	928361	928364	928364	sir	26649	" and enact various other little social civilities of the same ambiguous nature . Within the upper rooms were several gay ladies and jovially disposed gentlemen , all mainly intent upon the pleasures of eating or drinking , which occupations were however relieved by boisterous shouts of laughter and practical jokes of all kinds . In justice to the proprietor of this establishment it must be observed that he conducted it upon as orderly a system as could be possibly maintained when the characters of his patrons and patronesses are taken into consideration ; and the moment a disturbance occurred , either himself or his waiters adopted the most efficient means of putting an end to it , by bundling the offenders neck - and - crop into the street . The two gentlemen who lounged , as before stated , into this celebrated night - house on the occasion alluded to , took possession of a vacant box , and throwing down their cigars , summoned the waiter . "
928376	928439	928368	928368	sir	26649	" cried the chief functionary thus adjured , and who was busy at the moment in disputing the items of the score with the linen - draper 's assistant:—but , when that little matter was duly settled to the satisfaction of the waiter and the discomfiture of the assistant aforesaid , he hurried up to the table occupied by the new comers . "
928449	928461	928447	928447	Harborough	1008	" asked one of the gentlemen , appealing to his companion . "
928474	928479	928467	928467	I	0	" was the reply . "
928488	928505	928467	928467	I	0	" Thus encouraged , Mr. Chichester ( for it was he ) desired the waiter to bring "
928511	928520	928523	928523	sir	26649	" and to follow with a cold fowl . "
928529	928556	928523	928523	sir	26649	" said the domestic , hastily transferring a pepper - box from one side of the table to the other , and smoothing down the cloth : "
928567	928568	928565	928565	gentlemen	27077	" "
928574	928579	928565	928565	gentlemen	27077	" returned Mr. Chichester ; "
928586	928587	928590	928590	sir	26649	" "
928595	928653	928590	928590	sir	26649	sir:"—and the waiter glided away with that kind of shuffling , shambling motion which no living beings save waiters can ever accomplish . When the provender was duly supplied , and the first glass of champagne was quaffed , Chichester leant across the table , and said to the baronet in a low tone of chuckling triumph , "
928676	928677	928590	928590	sir	26649	" "
928684	928690	928590	928590	sir	26649	" returned Sir Rupert Harborough . "
928721	928722	928717	928717	I	0	" "
928732	928736	928717	928717	I	0	" said Chichester ; "
928762	928763	928747	928747	you	24401	" "
928770	928775	928747	928747	you	24401	" replied the baronet . "
928778	928779	928780	928780	Greenwood	903	" "
928782	928786	928789	928789	you	24401	" added Chichester . "
928798	928799	928795	928795	he	903	" "
928835	928836	928837	928838	The scoundrel	13697	" "
928872	928877	928863	928863	I	0	" said the baronet . "
928913	928914	928892	928892	his	903	" "
928925	928931	928919	928919	we	24405	" interrupted Chichester , impatiently . "
928976	929008	929012	929012	he	24406	" The baronet glanced in the direction indicated ; and immediately afterwards gave an affirmative nod of the head to his companion : then , leaning across the table he whispered , "
929069	929070	929057	929057	he	10669	" "
929076	929087	929092	929092	he	10669	" inquired Chichester , also speaking in a subdued tone . "
929096	929101	929092	929092	he	10669	" replied the baronet . "
929130	929174	929116	929116	I	0	" The two friends resumed the discussion of their supper , and in a few minutes began to converse with each other in a tone loud enough to be heard — and intended also to be so heard — in the next box . "
929192	929205	929177	929177	you	24401	" observed the baronet , in a tone of mere friendly courtesy . "
929221	929233	929212	929213	Sir Rupert	887	" was the answer , delivered in the same punctilious manner . "
929247	929248	929235	929235	you	24401	" "
929254	929294	929251	929252	Mr. Chichester	886	" cried the baronet : then drawing out a betting - book from the breast - pocket of his coat , he proceeded to enter the wager , saying aloud and in a measured tone as he did so , "
929317	929343	929251	929252	Mr. Chichester	886	" This ceremony was followed on the part of Mr. Chichester , who , having produced his book , wrote down the wager , saying , "
929364	929365	929362	929362	baronet	24415	" "
929369	929374	929362	929362	baronet	24415	" exclaimed the baronet , "
929410	929411	929414	929415	Sir Rupert	887	" "
929417	929421	929414	929415	Sir Rupert	887	" cried Chichester . "
929431	929442	929414	929415	Sir Rupert	887	Derby:"—then , as if speaking to himself , he continued , "
929489	929510	929486	929487	Sir Rupert	887	" he exclaimed , raising his head from the contemplation of the leaf on which these sham bets were entered , "
929520	929521	929516	929516	I	0	" "
929527	929685	929516	929516	I	0	" said the baronet ; and the wager was accordingly inscribed in the little books . The two gentlemen then refreshed themselves each with another draught of champagne ; and Sir Rupert Harborough , as he drank , glanced over the edge of the glass into the next box , to ascertain the effect produced upon Mr. Egerton by the previous little display of sporting spirit . That effect was precisely the one which had been anticipated . Mr. Egerton was not so tipsy but that he was struck with the aristocratic names of the two gentlemen in the next box ; and he raised his head from the bosom of a Cyprian to take a view of Sir Rupert Harborough , Bart . , and the Honourable Arthur Chichester . So satisfactory was the result of the survey — at least to himself — that he determined not only to show off a little of his own "
929689	929789	929516	929516	I	0	" but also , if possible , form the acquaintance of the two gentlemen ; for , like many young fellows similarly circumstanced , he was foolish enough to believe that the possession of money must prove a passport to the best society , if he could only obtain an opening . Therefore , having greedily devoured every word of the dialogue just detailed , and taking it for granted that nothing in this world was ever more sincere than the betting of Sir Rupert Harborough , Bart . , and the Honourable Arthur Chichester , Mr. Egerton exclaimed , "
929815	929816	929805	929805	you	27077	" "
929821	929828	929819	929819	sir	26649	" said the baronet , gravely , "
929852	929860	929861	929861	I	0	" he added with a gracious smile , "
929877	929878	929861	929861	I	0	" "
929889	929894	929861	929861	I	0	" ejaculated Mr. Egerton . "
929970	929971	929967	929967	I	0	" "
929978	929982	929974	929974	I	0	" answered the baronet "
929999	930000	930003	930003	him	886	" "
930007	930013	930003	930003	him	886	" returned the young man . "
930050	930051	930046	930046	I	0	" "
930059	930076	930046	930046	I	0	" observed Mr. Chichester , carelessly : then , taking out his book , he said , "
930106	930107	930100	930100	I	0	" "
930117	930159	930115	930115	sir	26649	" asked the young gentleman , looking round the room with an air of importance , as if he were quite accustomed to the thing , although it was in reality the first wager he had ever laid in his life . "
930171	930194	930169	930169	sir	26649	" returned Chichester : then , glancing in an inquiring manner towards his new acquaintance , he said with a bland smile , "
930209	930210	930202	930202	I	0	" "
930223	930228	930215	930215	you	26649	" interrupted the other . "
930250	930404	930238	930238	I	0	" He then produced his card ; and Mr. Chichester , of course , affected not to have been previously aware of the young gentleman 's name . The bet between them was duly recorded — by Mr. Chichester in his little book , and by Mr. Albert Egerton on the back of a love - letter . The latter gentleman then called for his bill , and having glanced at the amount , paid it without a murmur , adding a munificent donation for the waiter . Having effected this arrangement , by means of which he got rid of the women who had fastened themselves on him , he coolly passed round to the table at which his new acquaintances were seated , and called for another bottle of champagne . When it was brought , he was about to pay for it ; but Sir Rupert interrupted him , saying , "
930431	930483	930427	930429	a better acquaintance	24436	" The bottle went round rapidly ; and Mr. Egerton became quite enchanted with the agreeable manners of Sir Rupert Harborough , Bart . , and the off - hand pleasant conversation of the Honourable Arthur Chichester . It was now past one o'clock ; and the baronet proposed to depart . "
930493	930497	930487	930487	you	24434	" inquired Egerton . "
930505	930532	930487	930487	you	24434	" returned Harborough , in a tone of gentle remonstrance , as much as to say that there could have been no doubt upon the subject . "
930539	930540	930534	930534	you	24434	" "
930543	930548	930534	930534	you	24434	" was the answer : "
930563	930610	930550	930550	we	24435	" The baronet called for the bill , paid it , and led the way from the room , followed by Egerton and Chichester , the former of whom insisted upon stopping at the bar to take some soda water , as he declared himself to be "
930619	930723	930550	930550	we	24435	" While the three gentlemen were engaged in partaking each of a bottle of the refreshing beverage , Sir Rupert felt his coat - sleeve gently pulled from behind ; and , turning round , he perceived a man whom he had noticed in the coffee - room . Indeed , this was one of the black - legs already alluded to as having been engaged in treating Cyprians to supper and champagne . The baronet instantly comprehended the nature of the business which this individual had to address him upon ; and making him a significant sign , he said to Chichester , "
930756	930822	930746	930746	I	0	" Gentleman , indeed!—one of the most astounding knaves in London ! But vice and roguery compel the haughty aristocrat to address the lowest ruffian as an equal . Chichester took Egerton 's arm , and sauntered out of the house , attended to the door by the obsequious master of the establishment — an honour shown only to those who drink champagne or claret . "
930831	930851	930746	930746	I	0	" asked the baronet , taking the black - leg aside , and speaking to him in a whisper . "
930858	930863	930855	930856	Sir Rupert	887	" returned the man : "
930960	930961	930952	930952	you	887	" "
930968	930973	930964	930964	you	0	" said the baronet . "
930996	930997	930962	930962	I	0	" "
931007	931021	930962	930962	I	0	" answered the black - leg , consigning the notes to his pocket . "
931061	931062	931063	931063	I	0	" "
931069	931076	931063	931063	I	0	" said the baronet , colouring . "
931086	931091	931063	931063	I	0	" continued the man . "
931180	931181	931184	931186	my good fellow	27449	" "
931189	931194	931184	931186	my good fellow	27449	" stammered the baronet . "
931211	931218	931184	931186	my good fellow	27449	" persisted the black - leg , "
931247	931248	931237	931237	you	0	" "
931255	931260	931237	931237	you	0	" said Sir Rupert . "
931342	931343	931350	931352	a dead man	31780	" "
931357	931529	931354	931355	Sir Rupert	887	" whispered the black - leg . He then returned to the supper - room ; and the baronet hastened after his friends . Sir Rupert Harborough , Mr. Albert Egerton , and Mr. Arthur Chichester were walking arm - in - arm , and smoking cigars , along the West Strand , about ten minutes after the little incident which closed the preceding chapter , when they were met by two tall and fashionable - looking gentlemen , who immediately recognised the baronet and Chichester . Both parties stopped ; and the two gentlemen were in due course introduced to Mr. Egerton as Lord Dunstable and the Honourable Colonel Cholmondeley . By the significant tone and manner of the baronet,—a sort of freemasonry known only to the initiated,—both Dunstable and the Colonel were given to understand that a flat had been caught in the person of Mr. Albert Egerton ; and they immediately received their cue as completely as if they had been prompted by half an hour 's explanation . "
931543	931557	931532	931532	you	24457	" inquired Dunstable , as they all now proceeded together through Trafalgar Square . "
931569	931629	931532	931532	you	24457	" answered the baronet , carelessly . Mr. Egerton drew himself up an inch higher immediately , although somewhat top - heavy with the champagne and cigars;—but he felt quite proud — quite another man , indeed — at being numbered amongst Sir Rupert Harborough 's friends , and at walking familiarly in the company of a real lord . "
931646	931673	931632	931632	I	0	" observed Dunstable , forgetting at the moment that himself and friend were proceeding in quite a contrary direction when the meeting alluded to took place . "
931686	931696	931679	931679	we	24461	" Egerton noticed not the little oversight . The word "
931699	931998	931632	931632	I	0	" perfectly electrified him . He had often passed by the great pandemonium in St. James 's Street , and looked with wistful eyes at its portals — marvelling whether they would ever unfold to give admission to him ; and now that there seemed a scintillation of a chance of that golden wish , which he had so often shadowed forth , being substantially gratified , he could scarcely believe that he was in truth Albert Egerton , the son of an outfitter , and having a very respectable widowed aunt engaged in the haberdashery line on Finsbury Pavement;—but it appeared as if he had suddenly received a transfusion of that aristocracy in whose company he found himself . Already did he make up his mind to cut the good old aunt and the half - dozen of fair cousins — her daughters — for ever:—already did he vow never to be seen east of Temple Bar again . But then he thought how pleasant it would be to drop in at Finsbury Pavement on some Sunday — just at the hour of dinner , which he could make his lunch — and then astound his relatives with the mention of his aristocratic acquaintances,—no , his friends,—Lord Dunstable , Sir Rupert Harborough , the Honourable Colonel Cholmondeley , and the Honourable Arthur Chichester ! And what glorious names , too:—nothing plebeian about them — nothing lower than an Honourable ! Had he known how cheaply Mr. Chichester held his titular decoration , Albert Egerton would have perhaps assumed one himself : but he did not entertain the least suspicion concerning the matter , and therefore envied the pawnbroker 's son almost as much as either of the others . But to return . Lord Dunstable had said , "
932007	932021	931632	931632	I	0	" Deep was the suspense of Mr. Egerton until Sir Rupert Harborough replied , "
932044	932045	932037	932037	Egerton	1818	" "
932052	932061	932047	932047	I	0	" he murmured , in a disconsolate tone . "
932069	932074	932064	932065	all members	24465	" said Lord Dunstable ; "
932092	932737	932086	932086	Harborough	887	" This arrangement was rendered necessary by the fact that Mr. Chichester was not a member of Crockford 's , and would , therefore , require to be introduced by Colonel Cholmondeley . Dunstable , Harborough , and Egerton accordingly walked on together ; while the Colonel and Chichester followed at some little distance , as it was not thought worth while to allow the young flat to perceive that the Honourable Arthur Chichester must be smuggled in , as it were , as well as himself . In this manner the two parties repaired to the celebrated — or rather notorious — Saint James 's Club ; and Egerton 's wildest dream was realized — the acmé of his ambition was reached — the portals of Crockford 's were darkened by his plebeian shadow ! Although excited by wine and by the novelty of his situation , he nevertheless maintained his self - possession so far as to avoid any display of vulgar wonderment at the brilliant scene upon which he now entered . Leaning on the arms of Lord Dunstable and Sir Rupert Harborough , he passed through the marble hall , and was conducted to the coffee - room on the right - hand side . There they waited for a few minutes until Cholmondeley and Chichester joined them ; and Egerton had leisure to admire the superb pier - glasses , the magnificent chandeliers , the handsome side - boards , the costly plate , and the other features of that gorgeous apartment . When the Colonel and Chichester made their appearance , the party proceeded to the supper - room . There Egerton 's eyes were completely dazzled by the brilliant looking - glasses , all set in splendid frames with curious designs — the crystal chandeliers — the elegant sconces — the superb mouldings — the massive plate — and the immense quantities of cut glasses and decanters . The curtains were of the richest damask silk ; the walls were hung with choice pictures ; and the whole magic scene was brilliantly lighted up with innumerable wax candles , the lustre of which was reflected in the immense mirrors . In a word , the voluptuousness and luxury of that apartment surpassed any thing of the kind that young Egerton had ever before witnessed . Seated near one of the fire - places in conversation with an elderly gentleman , was an old man , somewhat inclined to stoutness , and very slovenly in his costume . His clothes were good ; but they appeared to have been tossed upon him with a pitch - fork . His coat hung in large loose wrinkles over his rounded shoulders : his trousers appeared to hitch up about the thighs , as if through some defect in their cut ; two or three of his waistcoat buttons had escaped from their holes , or else had not been fastened in them at all ; his cravat was limp ; and his shirt - frill was tumbled . His countenance was pale and sickly , and totally inexpressive of that natural astuteness and sharpness which had raised him from the most obscure position to be the companion of the noblest peers in the realm . His eyes were of that lack - lustre species which usually predicate mental dullness and moral feebleness , but which was at variance with the general rule in this instance . In a word , his entire appearance bespoke an individual whose health was wasted by long vigils and the want of needful repose and rest . When Lord Dunstable 's party entered the room , there were already three or four groups occupying supper - tables , on which the French dishes , prepared in Ude 's best style steamed , with delicious odour . "
932746	932751	932743	932744	Mr. Egerton	1818	" inquired Lord Dunstable . "
932761	932766	932754	932754	I	0	" was the reply . "
932782	932842	932769	932771	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" It was not true that Egerton had supped with the baronet and Chichester , as the reader knows ; but Sir Rupert had already said so of his own accord , and Mr. Egerton was not the young man to contradict a statement which seemed to place him upon a certain degree of intimacy with the aforesaid baronet . "
932851	932869	932848	932849	my lord	27330	" cried the stout gentleman , rising from his seat near the fire , and accosting Dunstable . "
932890	932891	932896	932896	you	0	" "
932898	932904	932894	932894	I	0	" said Dunstable , coolly : "
932934	932963	932931	932932	Mr. Egerton	1818	" And a significant glance , rapid as lightning , from Lord Dunstable 's eyes , conveyed his meaning to the stout elderly gentleman with the sickly face . "
933004	933046	933002	933002	sir	26649	" These last words were addressed to Egerton , and were accompanied by a very low bow . Dunstable took the young man 's arm , and led him into the next apartment , where there was a French hazard table . "
933064	933082	933083	933088	That good - natured old gentleman	24483	" inquired Egerton , in a whisper , when they had passed from the supper - room . "
933090	933114	933083	933088	That good - natured old gentleman	24483	" cried Dunstable , aloud , and bursting out into a fit of laughter so hearty that the tears ran down his cheeks : "
933121	933122	933123	933123	Crockford	1826	" "
933125	933144	933145	933150	a good - natured old gentleman	24484	" repeated Egerton , in astonishment ; for , although he had denominated the presiding genius of the place "
933152	933186	933145	933150	a good - natured old gentleman	24484	" he had not failed to observe the execrable English which he spoke , and was overwhelmed with surprise to learn that the friend of nobles was at such open hostilities with grammar . "
933198	933208	933194	933196	the great Crockford	1826	" continued Lord Dunstable , in an under tone . "
933252	933349	933352	933352	he	24489	" There were only three or four persons lounging about in the Hazard - Room , previously to the entrance of Dunstable , Egerton , Harborough , Cholmondeley , and Chichester ; and no play was going on . The moment , however , those gentlemen made their appearance , the loungers to whom we have just alluded , and who were decoy - ducks connected with the establishment , repaired to the table and called for dice , while his croupiers took their seats , and the groom - porter instantly mounted upon his stool . "
933358	933366	933352	933352	he	24489	" asked Egerton , in a whisper . "
933374	933379	933352	933352	he	24489	" replied Lord Dunstable . "
933387	933388	933352	933352	he	24489	" "
933403	933438	933352	933352	he	24489	" said the foolish young man , afraid of being deemed unfashionable in the eyes of his new acquaintances if he admitted that he never yet handled a dice - box in his life . "
933450	933460	933463	933463	I.	24491	" exclaimed Dunstable , who saw through the artifice : "
933472	933526	933467	933467	Crockey	1828	" And , as he spoke , Mr. Crockford made his appearance , holding in his hands an elegant rosewood case , which he placed upon the table , and behind which he immediately seated himself . The dice - box was now taken by Lord Dunstable , who set ten sovereigns , called "
933528	933537	933352	933352	he	24489	" as a main , and threw seven . "
933542	933549	933352	933352	he	24489	" exclaimed the groom - porter . "
933557	933565	933566	933566	I	0	" said Sir Rupert Harborough to Egerton : "
933575	933576	933566	933566	I	0	" "
933579	933734	933566	933566	I	0	" cried Egerton ; and in another moment he had the pleasure of handing over his money to the baronet . After Lord Dunstable had thrown out , Mr. Chichester took the box , and Cholmondeley in his turn ensnared Egerton into a private bet , which the young man of course lost . But he parted from his bank - notes with a very good grace ; for , although considerably sobered by the soda - water which he had drunk at the Paradise , yet what with the wine and the idea of being at that moment beneath Crockford 's roof , he was sufficiently intoxicated to be totally reckless of his financial affairs . Thus , after having lost a bet to each of his friends , he was easily persuaded to take the box , and dispense a little more of his cash for the especial benefit of Mr. Crockford . "
933742	933746	933735	933735	I	0	" cried Egerton , "
933753	933759	933735	933735	I	0	" He then threw ten . "
933764	933771	933735	933735	I	0	" cried the groom - porter . "
933777	933781	933735	933735	I	0	" said Dunstable ; "
933798	933802	933735	933735	I	0	" Egerton threw . "
933811	933833	933735	933735	I	0	" cried the groom - porter . And the young man 's money was swept towards the bank in a moment . "
933840	933844	933838	933838	Egerton	1818	" exclaimed Chichester . "
933852	933886	933887	933887	I	0	" was the reply — for the waiter had just handed round goblets of the most delicious claret , and the lights began to dance somewhat confusedly before the young victim 's eyes . "
933902	933903	933919	933919	ace	24492	" "
933909	933916	933919	933919	ace	24492	" cried the groom - porter : "
933923	933949	933919	933919	ace	24492	" And away went the bank - notes to the rosewood case at the head of the table . Colonel Cholmondeley now took the box . "
933959	933963	933951	933951	you	0	" he said . "
933969	933982	933951	933951	you	0	" was the reply , given with a stammer and a blush ; "
934006	934013	934000	934000	my	0	" Dunstable nodded significantly to Crockford . "
934020	934043	934000	934000	my	0	" said the old hell - keeper , rising from his seat and shuffling towards Egerton , whom he drew partially aside ; "
934073	934074	934079	934079	Egerton	1818	" "
934081	934086	934079	934079	Egerton	1818	" whispered Lord Dunstable . "
934108	934109	934110	934110	I	0	" "
934114	934149	934150	934150	I	0	" hesitated the young man for a moment , as the thought of his previous losses flashed to his mind , even amidst the dazzling influence of Crockford 's club and his aristocratic acquaintances : "
934153	934154	934150	934150	I	0	" "
934161	934183	934159	934159	sir	26649	" said the waiter , approaching him with a massive silver salver on which stood the crystal goblets of ruby wine . "
934185	934218	934289	934289	I	0	you;"—and Egerton quaffed the aromatic juice to drown the unpleasant ideas which had just intruded themselves upon him : then , as he replaced the glass upon the salver , he said , "
934233	934250	934227	934227	I	0	" Sir Rupert Harborough took the box , set himself in ten pounds , and cried , "
934256	934261	934227	934227	I	0	" He then threw . "
934266	934273	934227	934227	I	0	" exclaimed the groom - porter . "
934283	934288	934289	934289	I	0	" observed Colonel Cholmondeley . "
934295	934299	934289	934289	I	0	" cried Egerton . "
934307	934315	934305	934305	sir	26649	" said the pompous groom - porter : "
934324	934325	934318	934320	not a setter	24498	" "
934330	934339	934340	934341	The gentleman	27107	" cried Crockford , affecting a jocular chuckle . "
934364	934365	934361	934362	the gentleman	27107	" "
934379	934413	934376	934377	the caster	24496	" said Egerton , now growing interested in the play as he began to understand it better . Sir Rupert threw a few times , and at last turned up six and three . "
934422	934468	934473	934473	sir	26649	" cried the groom - porter . Egerton now insisted upon taking the box again ; and in a few minutes he had not a fraction left of the thousand pounds which he had borrowed . He turned away from the table and sighed deeply . "
934475	934548	934473	934473	sir	26649	" said the waiter , as composedly as if he were offering the wine through civility and not for the systematic purpose of washing away a remorse . Egerton greedily swallowed the contents of a goblet ; and when he looked again towards the table , he was astounded to find another bundle of Bank notes thrust into his hand by the obliging Mr. Crockford , who said in his blandest tones , "
934561	934562	934551	934551	you	26649	" "
934572	934576	934577	934577	you	26649	" whispered Dunstable : "
934586	934587	934577	934577	you	26649	" "
934596	934647	934670	934670	you	26649	" murmured Egerton , with a sickly smile : but still he took the money . He then played rapidly — wildly — desperately,—drinking wine after each new loss , and inwardly cursing his unlucky stars . The second thousand pounds were soon gone ; and Dunstable whispered to Crockford , "
934685	934686	934670	934670	you	26649	" "
934691	934698	934670	934670	you	26649	" answered the hell - keeper . "
934710	934711	934701	934701	you	26649	" "
934715	934727	934701	934701	you	26649	" returned Dunstable;—then turning towards his party , he said aloud , "
934741	934742	934730	934730	I	0	" "
934752	934792	934745	934745	I	0	" stammered Egerton , catching joyfully at the chance of an immediate escape from the place where fortunes were so speedily engulphed;—for tipsy as he now was again , the idea of his losses was uppermost in his mind . "
934801	934808	934799	934799	gentlemen	27077	" said Crockford , bowing deferentially ; "
934841	934842	934847	934847	he	26744	" "
934849	934853	934847	934847	he	26744	" interrupted Dunstable . "
934872	934873	934874	934874	I	0	" "
934888	936127	934885	934885	my	0	" returned the young man . But , as his hand trembled and his visual faculties were duplicated for the time , he was ten minutes ere he could fill up a printed cheque in a proper manner . The business was , however , accomplished at last , and the party withdrew , amidst the bows of decoy - ducks , croupiers , waiters , groom - porters , door - porters , and all the menials of the establishment . William Crockford was the founder of the Club which so long bore his name , and which was only broken up a short time ago . He began life as a fishmonger ; and when he closed his shop of an evening , was accustomed to repair to some of the West End hells , where he staked the earnings of the day . Naturally of a shrewd and far - seeing disposition , he was well qualified to make those calculations which taught him the precise chances of the hazard - table ; and a lucky bet upon the St. Leger suddenly helped him to a considerable sum of ready money , with which he was enabled to extend his ventures at the gaming - house . In due time he gave up the fish - shop , and joined some hellites in partnership at the West End . Fortune continued to favour him ; and he was at length in a condition to open No . 50 , St. James 's Street , as a Club . The moment the establishment was ready for the reception of members , announcements of the design were made in the proper quarters ; and it was advertised that all persons belonging to other Clubs were eligible to have their names enrolled without ballot as members of the St. James 's . The scheme succeeded beyond even the most sanguine hopes of Crockford himself ; and hundreds of peers , nobles , and gentlemen , who were fond of play , but who dared not frequent the common gaming - houses , gladly became supporters and patrons of the new Club . In the course of a short time No . 51 was added to the establishment ; and No . 52 was subsequently annexed . The rules and regulations were made more stringent , because several notorious black - legs had obtained admission ; but , until the very last , any member was permitted to introduce a stranger for one evening only , with the understanding that such visitor should be balloted for in due course . The entrance - fee was fixed at twenty guineas a year ; and an annual payment of ten guineas was required from every member . The three houses , thrown into one , were soon found to be too small for the accommodation of the members : they were accordingly pulled down , and the present magnificent building was erected on their site . It is impossible to say how much money was expended upon this princely structure ; but we can assert upon undoubted authority that the internal decorations alone cost ninety - four thousand pounds ! The real nature of this most scandalous and abominable establishment soon transpired . Hundreds of young men , who entered upon life with fortune and every brilliant prospect to cheer them , were immolated upon the infernal altar of that aristocratic pandemonium . Many of them committed suicide:—others perpetrated forgeries , to obtain the means of endeavouring to regain what they had lost , and ended their days upon the scaffold;—and not a few became decoy - ducks and bonnets in the service of the Arch - demon himself . Even noblemen of high rank did not hesitate to fill these ignominious offices ; and for every flat whom they took to the house , they received a recompense proportionate to the spoil that was obtained . To keep up appearances with their fellow members , these ruined lacqueys of the great hellite actually paid their subscriptions with the funds which he furnished them for the purpose . So infamous became the reputation of Crockford 's , that it was deemed necessary to devise means to place the establishment apparently upon the same footing with other Clubs . A committee of noblemen and gentlemen ( what precious noblemen and gentlemen , good reader ! ) was formed to administer the affairs of the institution ; but this proceeding was a mere blind . The Committee 's jurisdiction extended only to the laws affecting the introduction of new members , the expulsion of unruly ones , and the choice of the wines laid in for the use of the Club . The French Hazard Bank and all matters relating to the gambling - rooms were under the sole control of Crockford , who reaped enormous advantages from that position . Thus was it that a vulgar and illiterate man — a professed gambler — a wretch who lived upon the ruin of the inexperienced and unwary , as well as on the vices of the hoary sinner,—thus was he enabled to make noble lords and high - born gentlemen his vile tools , and thrust them forward as the ostensible managers of a damnable institution , the infamous profit of which went into his own purse![36 ] Albert Egerton now became the constant companion of the fashionable acquaintances whom he had accidentally picked up — or rather , who had cunningly picked up him . He dined with them at Long's;—he formed with them parties to eat fish at Greenwich and Blackwall;—he became a member of Crockford's;—and every day he lost considerable sums to them in one shape of gambling or another . They had ascertained that he was possessed , on coming of age a few weeks previously , of the handsome fortune of sixty thousand pounds ; and they determined to appropriate the best portion of it to their own uses . The Honourable Colonel Cholmondeley most obligingly acted as his Mentor in the choice of magnificent furnished apartments in Stratton Street;—Lord Dunstable was kind enough to purchase two thorough - breds for him , the price being only eight hundred guineas — a little transaction by which his lordship quietly pocketed three hundred as his own commission;—Mr . Chichester thought it no trouble to select a rare assortment of wines at one of the most fashionable merchants of the West End , and actually carried his good - nature so far as to see them carefully stowed away in the young dupe 's cellar;—and Sir Rupert Harborough generously surrendered to him his cast - off mistress . The four friends also conceived so violent an attachment towards Mr. Egerton , that they never lost sight of him . They managed matters so well that he had no time for compunctious reflections ; for they invariably made him drunk ere they took him home to his bed ; and when he awoke in the morning , the obliging Mr. Chichester was sure to be already there to give him sherry and soda - water . Then Harborough would drop in to breakfast ; and while Egerton was performing the duties of the toilette , Dunstable and Cholmondeley were sure to make their appearance . Perhaps Egerton would complain of headach . "
936138	936143	934885	934885	my	0	" Lord Dunstable exclaimed : "
936177	936178	936175	936175	Harborough	887	" "
936190	936199	936184	936184	I	0	" observed Egerton on one of these occasions : "

936342	936347	936335	936335	he	24522	" was the answer ; "
936375	936376	936361	936361	he	24522	" "
936383	936387	936361	936361	he	24522	" exclaimed Dunstable : "
936495	936613	936492	936492	he	26690	" Egerton was profoundly gratified with the absurd flattery thus constantly poured in his ear ; and as he really possessed a handsome person , he saw no difficulty in carrying out the idea of marrying an heiress . And this same belief has proved fatal to thousands and thousands of young men placed in the same situation as Albert Egerton . They pursue a career of reckless extravagance and dissipation , buoying themselves up with the hope that when their present resources shall have passed away , it will be the easiest thing possible to rebuild their fortunes by means of marriage . A month slipped away , and Egerton found himself on intimate terms with many "
936616	936644	936492	936492	he	26690	town"—one of the most popular members at Crockford's — a great favourite in certain titled but not over - particular families , where there were portionless daughters to "
936648	936810	936492	936492	he	26690	" and at whose house Lord Dunstable enjoyed the entrée — and the pride and delight ( as he believed ) of his four dear friends who had done so much for him ! And sure enough they had done a great deal in his behalf ; for he had already sold out twenty thousand pounds , or one third of his entire fortune ; but he was purposely kept in such an incessant whirl of excitement , pleasure , dissipation , and bustle , that he had no time for reflection . One morning — it was about eleven o'clock — the young man awoke with aching head and feverish pulse , after the usual night 's debauch ; and it happened that none of his dear friends had yet arrived . Egerton rang the bell for some white wine and soda - water to assuage the burning thirst which oppressed him ; and when his livery - boy , or "
936813	936838	936839	936840	A lady	4378	" appeared with the refreshing beverage , the young rake learnt that a lady was waiting to see him in the drawing - room . "
936842	936846	936851	936851	she	4378	" exclaimed Egerton : "
936854	936855	936851	936851	she	4378	" "
936866	936871	936858	936862	a stout , elderly lady	24534	" said the tiger . "
936879	936891	936874	936874	she	4378	" inquired Egerton , beginning to suspect who his visitor was . "
936896	936901	936874	936874	she	4378	" was the answer . "
936947	936948	936926	936926	she	4378	" "
936959	936965	936926	936926	she	4378	" muttered Egerton to himself . "
936978	936986	936926	936926	she	4378	rascal:"—fashionable upstarts always vent their annoyances upon their servants;—"and
937003	937093	936994	936994	I	0	" The tiger disappeared — returned with the hot - water — and then departed once more , to execute the latter portion of his master 's orders . Egerton felt truly wretched and ashamed of himself when he surveyed his pale cheeks and haggard eyes in the glass , and thought of the course which he had lately been pursuing . But then he remembered the flattery of his fashionable friends , and soothed his remorseful feelings by the idea that he was on intimate terms with all the "
937099	937207	936994	936994	I	0	" was a member of Crockford 's , and had the entrée of several families of distinction . Moreover , when he was shaved and washed,—oiled and perfumed,—and attired in a clean shirt , black trousers , red morocco slippers , and an elegant dressing - gown , his appearance was so much more satisfactory to himself that he felt quite equal to the task of encountering his relative . He accordingly proceeded , with a smile upon his lips and an easy unconstrained manner , to the drawing - room , where a respectable , motherly - looking , stout old lady was anxiously awaiting him . "
937212	937222	936994	936994	I	0	" she exclaimed , as he entered the apartment , "
937254	937321	937249	937249	you	1818	" And , while she spoke , the good - natured woman made a motion as if she were anxious to embrace her nephew ; but he — well aware that it is improper to give way to one 's feelings in the fashionable world — retreated a step or two , and graciously allowed his aunt to shake the tip of his fore - finger . "
937331	937337	937324	937324	Albert	1818	" exclaimed the baffled relative . "
937343	937352	937324	937324	Albert	1818	" she continued , quietly resuming her seat , "
937439	937440	937433	937433	he	1256	" "
937443	937451	937441	937441	Storks	1256	" murmured Egerton , turning very pale . "

937467	937477	937478	937478	he	1256	" continued the aunt , speaking with great volubility ; "

937887	937912	937868	937868	Albert	1818	" said Egerton , in a hurried and nervous tone , for a thundering double - knock at that moment reverberated through the house . "
937932	937933	937924	937925	some one	27192	" "
937943	937949	937940	937941	dear Al	24563	" observed the old lady . "

938002	938081	937963	937963	I	0	" he exclaimed , rushing forward , with out - stretched hand , to greet his young friend : but , perceiving the lady , who had risen from the sofa , he stopped short , and bowed to her with distant politeness — for it struck him at the moment that she might be a washerwoman , or the mother of Egerton 's servant , or a shirt - maker , or some such kind of person . "
938088	938108	938109	938109	I	0	" said the aunt , in acknowledgment of the bow ; and , resuming her seat , she observed , "

938163	938185	938153	938153	sir	26649	" answered Dunstable , in a cold tone ; while Egerton bit his lips — at a loss what to do . "
938193	938199	938153	938153	sir	26649	" continued the garrulous lady . "
938244	938245	938242	938242	sir	26649	" "
938258	938269	938250	938250	I	0	" said Lord Dunstable , with marvellous stiffness of manner . "
938277	938283	938275	938275	sir	26649	" literally shouted the lady . "

938309	938315	938307	938307	madam	26758	" was the cold reply . "
938351	938368	938344	938344	madam	26758	" And he turned towards Egerton , who was pretending to look out of the window . "
938374	938387	938388	938388	My	0	" exclaimed the lady , now eyeing the nobleman with sovereign contempt . "
938392	938409	938388	938388	My	0	" said Egerton , desperately resolved to put an end if possible to this awkward scene ; "

938653	938779	938780	938780	he	24592	" for having affected ere now not to know anything of the City . I can not fancy how I could have been so foolish . As for the Mansion House , it is the finest building in the world ; and Lombard Street is the very focus of attraction . With Aldgate I am well acquainted ; and a pleasant spot it is , too . The butchers ' shops in the neighbourhood must be quite healthy for consumptive people . Then you have Whitechapel , madam;—fine — wide — and open : the Commercial Road — delightful proof of the industry of this great city;—and , best of all , there is the Albion in Aldersgate Street,—where , by the by , Egerton , "

938802	938809	938811	938811	Egerton	1818	" Oh ! yes — certainly , "

What would England 's commerce be without such industrious , plodding , intelligent persons as your aunt ? Egerton , my boy , you ought to be proud of her — as I am of her acquaintance . But there is Chichester 's knock , I 'll swear ! "

We are assured by persons who have seen the Bruiser in training at Bexley Heath , and the Pet at Cheshunt , that the men are in first - rate condition , and full of confidence . The Bruiser has vowed that if he is beaten in this fight , he will retire altogether from the Ring ; but his friends do not for a moment apprehend that the result will be such as to occasion such a step . The admirers of this truly British sport have begun to flock to the neighbourhood of the scene of action ; and every bed at Wigginton is already let . In fact we know of two guineas having been offered and refused for a mere ' shake - down ' in the tap of the Green Lion , at that beautiful little village . The odds in favour of the Bruiser have risen within these few days to eleven to five . The Bruiser 's backers are not known : they are most likely some swell nobs , who prefer keeping out of sight . Some thousands of pounds will change hands next Thursday . "

941755	941844	941752	941752	he	1792	" you can place yourself in a somewhat more comfortable position than that in which I deeply regret to find you ; and , when you feel inclined to see me again , be good enough to write me a note to that effect , so that I may call upon you . For , if it would not be impertinently prying into your affairs , I should wish to learn the sad narrative of those reverses which have so reduced a gentleman of your rank and station . "

All London rings with the fame of his goodness : his whole time seems to be passed in benefiting his fellow - creatures ! Wherever poverty is known to exist , thither does he send in secret his unostentatious charity ! But such good deeds can not remain concealed ; and I — I for one will proclaim to all who have spurned me in my bitter need , that a stranger has saved me — and that stranger a great Prince whose shoes they are not worthy to touch ! "
942736	942905	942909	942909	my	0	" I was born in 1790 , and am consequently in my fifty - third year . My father was a merchant , who married late in life , upon his retirement from business ; and I was an only child . Your Highness may therefore well imagine that I was spoilt by my affectionate parents , whose mistaken tenderness would never permit me to be thwarted in any inclination which it was possible for them to gratify . Instead of being sent to school at a proper age , I was kept at home , and a master attended daily to give me instruction in the rudiments of education ; but as I preferred play to learning , and found that if I pleaded headach my mother invariably suggested the propriety of giving me a holiday , I practised that subterfuge so constantly , that my master 's place was a sinecure , and I could scarcely read two words correctly when I was ten years old . "
943112	943253	943272	943272	his	2156	" I had just completed my sixteenth year , and was one afternoon passing the half - holiday at pitch and toss with several other boys in a remote corner of the spacious play - ground , when an usher came to inform me that my father had just arrived , and was waiting in the parlour . Thither I accordingly repaired ; and in a few minutes after I had been closeted with my parent , I learnt that he had just purchased an ensign 's commission for me in the — th regiment of Light Infantry , and that I was to return home with him that very day to prepare my outfit previously to joining the corps . Thus was I suddenly transformed from a raw school - boy into an officer in His Majesty 's service . "
943463	943603	943604	943604	I	0	" Colonel Beaumont was mightily annoyed when he heard that a merchant 's son had obtained a commission in his regiment ; for , aristocratic as military officers are even now - a - days in their opinions , they were far more illiberal and proud at the time when I entered the army . It was then the year 1807 — during the war , and when the deaths of Pitt and Fox , which both occurred in the previous year , had left the country in a very distracted condition . When , however , the colonel learnt that my father was a rich man , that I had a handsome allowance , and was possessed of a couple of fine horses , his humour underwent an immediate change , and he received me with marked politeness . "
943887	944347	944348	944349	The colonel	30185	" One evening — when I had been about a year in the regiment — it was my turn to give the wine - party in my room ; but at the usual hour of meeting no one made his appearance save the colonel . ' Well , ' he said , laughing , ' I suppose we cleaned the others out so effectually last night , that they have not a feather left to fly with . But that need not prevent us from having a game together . '—I readily assented , for cards and dice already possessed extraordinary fascinations in my eyes ; and we sat down to écarté . At first we played for small stakes , and drank our wine very leisurely ; but as I won nearly every game , the colonel became excited , and made more frequent applications to the bottle . Still he lost — and the more he lost , the more wine he took ; until , getting into a passion , he threw down the cards , exclaiming , ' Curse my ill - luck to - night ! I have already paid over to you a hundred and seventeen guineas at this miserable peddling work ; and I will have no more of it . Damn it , Anderson , if you 've any pluck you 'll let me set you fifty guineas at hazard?'—'Done ! ' cried I ; and the cards being thrown aside , we took to the dice . My luck still continued : I won three hundred pounds — all the ready money the colonel had about him ; and he then played on credit , scoring his losses on a sheet of paper . His excitement increased to a fearful pitch , and he drank furiously . Still we played on , and the grey dawn of morning found us at our shameful work . At length Beaumont started up , dashed the dice - box upon the floor , crushed it beneath his heel , and uttered a terrible imprecation upon his ill - luck . He drank soda - water to cool himself ; and we then examined the account that had been kept . The colonel owed me four thousand four hundred pounds , in addition to the ready money he had already lost . Pale as death , and with quivering lip , he gave me his note of hand for the amount ; and having enjoined me in a low hoarse voice not to mention the affair to a single soul , rushed out of the room . I retired to bed , as happy as if I had performed some great and honourable achievement . "
944887	944996	945009	945009	he	30185	" A few days after this event the colonel obtained three months ' leave of absence ; and during that period the major remained in command . He was a severe , but honourable and upright man ; and he intimated his desire that the wine - parties should be discontinued . Myself and the other officers who were accustomed to play , took the hint , and no longer assembled for gaming purposes in our rooms ; but we had supper - parties at one of the principal taverns in the town , and the cards and dice were in as much request amongst us as ever . "
945114	945205	945093	945093	he	30185	" Time passed very rapidly away , and my father purchased me a lieutenancy in the same regiment , a vacancy occurring . I would gladly have exchanged into another corps , the coldness of the colonel towards me being a source of much mortification and annoyance — the more especially as it was so little deserved on my part . I however rejoiced at my promotion , and submitted so resignedly to Beaumont 's behaviour that he never had an opportunity of addressing me in the language of reprimand . "
945491	945669	945486	945489	the charming Julia Vandeleur	1839	" I paid her a great deal of attention that evening , and called next day at her abode . To be brief , I soon became a constant visitor ; and Mrs. Vandeleur did not discountenance my presence . Nor did her daughter manifest any repugnance towards me . The influence of that dear creature was then most salutary:—would that it had always continued so ! For one year I never touched a card nor die , all my leisure time being passed at the cottage . To add to my happiness my father came down to Portsmouth to see me : he took apartments for a few weeks at the George Hotel ; and I introduced him to Mrs. and Miss Vandeleur . Although Julia was no heiress , my father was too much attached to me to throw any obstacle in the way of my suit ; and I was accepted as Miss Vandeleur 's intended husband . Oh ! what joyous days were those — days of the most pure and unadulterated happiness ! "
946215	946579	946586	946587	the Colonel	30185	" Colonel Beaumont speedily found that his malignant officiousness had failed to produce the desired aim ; and he called again , with some plausible pretext , upon the widow . By hypocritically affecting a merely conscientious motive in having acted as he had done , he gleaned from her the pledges I had made and the satisfaction with which she had received them . That same afternoon , at the mess - table , his manner became as kind and courteous towards me as it was wo nt to be when I first joined the regiment ; I could not however respond with any congeniality . Still he did not seem abashed , but appeared not to notice my disinclination to accept his advances . When I was about to leave the table , for the purpose of repairing to the abode of my beloved , the Colonel said , ' Anderson , I wish to speak to you in my room . '—I bowed and accompanied him thither.—'Let us forget the past , ' he said , extending his hand towards me , ' and be friendly as we were wont . '—'I am not aware , sir , ' was my reply , ' that I ever offended you . '—'No ; but you humiliated me , ' he answered , with a singular expression of countenance ; ' and that , to a military man and a superior officer , was most galling . Circumstances have lately changed with me . A distant relative has died and left me a considerable property ; and my first duty is to pay you the four thousand pounds I owe you . '—'That debt , sir , ' said I , ' has been cancelled long ago . '—'You generously destroyed the proof , ' he hastily rejoined ; ' but the obligation never could be annihilated , save in this manner : ' and he handed me the sum which he had formerly owed.—I of course received the amount , and my opinion of him grew far more favourable , in spite of his attempt to ruin me with Mrs. Vandeleur . "
946945	947260	946903	946904	a man	2001	" Oh ! what will your Highness think of me when I declare that I was alarmed by this threat , and that I yielded to the colonel 's urgent solicitation ! He produced wine ; and I drank deeply to drown my remorse . At first I trembled as I touched the dice - box — for I remembered the solemn oath pledged only a few days previously . But in a short time the influence of the liquor and the excitement of play stifled all compunction ; and I once more devoted myself to the game with all the intense interest which is experienced by the confirmed gamester . Beaumont was cool and collected : I was nervous and irritable . Fortune seemed to be bent upon giving him the revenge which he had solicited . I lost — we doubled our stakes : I continued to lose — and I steeped my vexation in frequent draughts of wine . In three hours I lost back again the whole amount he had paid me . The colonel then threw down the box , and said , ' I am satisfied . '—'But I am not , ' I exclaimed furiously : ' let us go on . '—'As you please , ' he observed calmly ; and , maddened with drink — hurried on , too , by the terrible excitement which gamblers alone can know , I played — and played until I owed the colonel two thousand three hundred pounds . Then a revulsion of feeling took place ; and I cursed my folly . I loathed myself : intoxicated as I was , I felt as a perjurer should feel . The colonel claimed my note of hand ; and I gave it . This done , I rushed wildly from his room , and hastened to my own . "
947581	947809	947838	947838	he	30185	" Much relieved by this speedy and easily - effected negotiation , I returned to Portsmouth , where I arrived at about nine o'clock in the evening . I repaired straight to the George Hotel , at which , as I expected , my father had put up . But he was not within ; and I accordingly hastened to the barracks to pay the money to Beaumont . The Colonel was at home , and received me with a chilling coldness for which , after all that had recently passed between us , I was little prepared . I did not however appear to notice the circumstance ; but tendered him the amount due . ' Oh ! Mr. Anderson , ' he replied , ' the debt is paid . '—'Paid ! ' I exclaimed , greatly surprised at this announcement.—'Yes , ' he said : ' it was settled this evening , about two hours since . Your father called on me , and redeemed the note of hand . '—'My father ! ' cried I , a cold chill striking to my heart : ' how came he to know that you held such a document?'—'Really , Mr. Anderson , I have no time to converse with you now , ' answered the Colonel ; and he bowed me out with freezing politeness . "
948148	948378	948379	948379	He	24911	" In reply to my hurried and anxious questions , I learnt that any attempt to see Julia would be vain , and could have no other result than to irritate Mrs. Vandeleur the more against me . My father offered me some consolation by the assurance that if I conducted myself well for a year , there would be a hope of reconciliation with the incensed lady ; and I trusted to Julia 's love to ensure her fidelity . Thus , partially — though very partially — relieved from the intenseness of that pain which now pierced to my very soul , I hastened to the barracks to superintend the packing up of my things , and to take leave of my brother - officers . This being done , I was passing out of the barrack - yard , when I encountered the Colonel . The light of the lamp fell upon his countenance , which expressed fiend - like satisfaction and triumph . Catching me by the arm , as I was about to pass him in silence , he muttered between his teeth , ' Anderson , I am avenged . You humiliated me once ; and I hate you for it ! Know me as your implacable enemy ; and renounce all hope of your Julia — for she shall be mine ! ' "
948490	948900	948902	948903	my father	2156	" The money that I had borrowed of the Jew was still in my possession ; and I resolved to lose no time in returning it . Accordingly , the very next day after my arrival in London , I set out on my way to his abode in the City ; but meeting with some officers of my acquaintance , I agreed to dine with them at an hotel in Bridge Street , Blackfriars . In fact , I was so very unhappy that I was glad to meet with such society ; and I thought that I could easily postpone my visit to the Jew until the morrow . The dinner was first - rate — the wines excellent ; and I drank copiously to drown my cares . Presently some one proposed cards : I could not offer any objection ; but I simply stated that I should not play . Cards , however , were brought ; and écarté was the game . I sate looking on . In the course of half an hour I saw a most favourable opportunity for making a good bet ; and , with the most wretched sophistry , I reasoned to myself that betting and playing were two very different things . I accordingly offered the wager , and won it . Encouraged by this success , I bet again ; and again I won . In less than another half hour I had pocketed two hundred guineas — for the play was high and the wagers in proportion . The ice was , alas ! again broken ; and it did not require much persuasion to induce me to take a hand . I thought of Julia — sighed and hesitated : I looked again at the cards — sighed once more — and seized them with that desperate feeling which we experience when we know we are doing wrong . To be brief , we kept up the play until three o'clock in the morning ; and I not only lost every farthing I had about me — amounting , with the Jew 's money and my own , to nearly three thousand pounds — but six hundred more by note of hand . It was understood that we should meet again on the following evening at another hotel , to settle accounts ; and I returned home in that state of mind which suggests suicide ! "
949107	949288	949102	949103	the Jew	35713	" For the three months during which my leave of absence lasted , I pursued the desperate career of a gamester , contriving , however , so well , that my father had not a single suspicion of the fatal truth . I was now in a fearful plight,—owing nearly six thousand pounds to the Jew , and compelled to devote nearly every pound I received from my father on leaving to join my regiment , to the payment of the interest . I remained for about ten months at Chatham , and still continued to play nightly . I was , however , unsuccessful , and quite unable to keep up the settlement of the quarterly amounts of interest with the rapacious Jew . What aggravated the mental anguish which I endured , was that my father corresponded with Mrs. Vandeleur from time to time , and gave her the most favourable accounts of me . Of this he informed me in his letters , and when I occasionally repaired to town to pass a few days with him . "
949523	949773	949516	949517	my father	2156	" Much as I longed to embrace my dear Julia , I was not sorry to be allowed a few hours ' delay in London ; for I felt how necessary it was to pacify the Jew . I accordingly called upon him , acquainted him with my approaching marriage , and stated that as it was my father 's intention to transfer to my name a considerable sum in the public funds , the monies owing should be paid with all arrears the moment that transfer took place . Goldshig seemed quite satisfied ; and I took leave of him with a light heart . But as I was issuing from his dwelling , I ran against Colonel Beaumont — my mortal enemy — who was about to enter the house . He started and was evidently much surprised : I was both surprised and annoyed . Convinced , however , that this meeting was a mere coincidence , and that his presence there had no connexion with my affairs , I was about to pass on with silent contempt , when he laid his hand on my arm — as he had done at the barrack - gate at Portsmouth thirteen months previously — and said , ' You think you will yet possess Julia : you are mistaken ! She has repulsed me — but you know that I can avenge an insult!'—I thrust him rudely away from me , smiled contemptuously , and passed on . "
949961	950022	949951	949951	I	0	" I learnt that Colonel Beaumont had , as Mrs. Vandeleur stated in her letter , persecuted my Julia with his addresses , and implored her to marry him . But her heart remained faithful to me , although circumstances had compelled her mother to explain to her the cause of our separation ; and the Colonel was summarily refused . "
950158	950476	950129	950130	Mrs. Vandeleur	1840	" While Julia was taking leave of her affectionate parent in a private room , a waiter entered the apartment where I and my father were conversing together , and informed me that a person desired to speak to me below . I followed the waiter to a parlour on the ground - floor ; and there — to my ineffable horror — I found Mr. Goldshig . Two suspicious - looking men were standing apart in a corner . I instantly comprehended the truth . I was arrested for the debt owing to the Jew . In vain did I attempt to expostulate with him on the harshness of this proceeding . ' You know very well , ' said he , ' that you and your wife are going off to the continent , and I might have whistled for my money if I had not done this . In fact , the person who gave me the information , strongly urged me to arrest you on Saturday evening immediately after your arrival ; but there was some delay in getting the writ . However , you are safe in the officer 's hands now ; and you must go to quod if your father do n't give his security . '—I was overwhelmed by this sudden disaster ; and I vowed vengeance upon Beaumont , whose malignity I too well recognised as the origin of my present predicament . There was no alternative but to send for my father . His sorrow was immense ; and he assured me that in settling the debt , he was moved only by consideration for the feelings of my bride and her mother , whom he would not plunge into affliction by allowing his son 's conduct to reach their ears . He accordingly gave his security to the Jew ; and I was once more free . "
950690	950772	950687	950687	his	36632	" I now found myself the possessor of a fortune amounting in ready money to thirty - six thousand pounds . Mrs. Vandeleur resided with us ; and , when the mournful impression created by my father 's death became softened down , there was not a happier family in the universe than ours . My Julia was all that I had anticipated — amiable , affectionate , and as faultless as a wife as she was excellent as a daughter . "
950874	951256	950847	950847	friends	26675	" Such was my position when a friend one day proposed that I should become a member of a Club to which he already belonged . Mrs. Vandeleur and Julia , seeing that I was very much at home , thought that this step would ensure me a little recreation and change of scene , and therefore advocated the propriety of accepting the offer . I was balloted for and elected . My friend was a well - meaning , sincere , and excellent man , who had not the slightest idea of placing me in the way of temptation when he made the proposal just mentioned . Neither had my mother - in - law or wife the least suspicion that play ever took place at a Club . I was equally ignorant of the fact until I became initiated ; and then I perceived the precipice on which I had suddenly placed myself . But I dared not make any observation to my friend on the subject ; for he was totally unaware that gaming had ever been amongst the number of my failings . To be brief , I had not been a member of the Club six weeks , when I was one evening induced to sit down to a rubber of whist with three staid old gentlemen , who only played for amusement . ' There can not be any harm in doing this , ' said I to myself ; ' because no money is staked . Moreover , even if there were , I have now acquired such control over myself that I could not possibly forget my solemn vows in this respect . '—Thus endeavouring to soothe my conscience — for I knew that I was doing wrong , but would not admit it even to myself — I sate down . We played for an hour , at the expiration of which one gentleman left and another took his place . The new - comer proposed shilling points , ' just to render the game interesting . ' The other two gentlemen agreed : I could not possibly — at least , I thought I could not — seem so churlish or so mean as to refuse to play on those terms . "
951477	951638	951639	951639	My	0	" I shall not linger upon details . The current of my fatal predilection — dammed up for five years and a half — had now broken through its flood - gates , and rushed on with a fury rendered more violent by the lengthened accumulation of volume and power . Écarté was my favourite game ; and I found several members of the Club willing to play with me on all occasions . For some time I neither gained nor lost to any important amount ; but one evening the play ran high , and — hurried along by that singular infatuation which prompts the gamester to exert himself to recover his losses — I staked large sums . Fortune was opposed to me ; and I retired a loser of nearly two thousand pounds . The ice being once more completely broken , I plunged headlong into the fatal vortex ; and my peace of mind was gone ! "
952015	952386	951991	951991	her	24985	" I persisted in my fearful course ; and , as if I were not already surrounded by elements of ruin sufficiently powerful , I became a member of Crockford 's . In saying that , I mention sufficient to convince your Highness that I rushed wilfully and blindly on to the goal of utter destruction . My fortune disappeared rapidly ; and when it was gone , I sold my commission , and then applied to Goldshig , who lent me money upon the most exorbitant terms . But let me pass over the incidents of three years . At the expiration of that time how was I situated ? What was the condition of my family ? Painful as these reminiscences are , I will not conceal the facts from your Highness . In a chamber at the house in Russell Square Mrs. Vandeleur lay upon her death - bed . Julia — pale , with haggard eyes , sunken cheeks , and appearance so care - worn that it would have moved even the heart of an overseer or master of a workhouse,—Julia hung , weeping bitterly , over the pillow . In the nursery , a servant was endeavouring to pacify the children , who were crying because they knew that their ' dear grandmamma , ' was very , very ill . In the kitchen an ill - looking fellow was dozing by the fire:—he was a bailiff 's man in possession — for there was an execution levied on my property . And I — where was I ? Gone to solicit Goldshig the Jew for a few days ' grace , the sale having been advertised to take place next morning ! Thus was this once happy home now invaded by misery and distress:—thus was an amiable wife plunged into sorrows so keen , woes so bitter , afflictions so appalling , that it was no wonder if her charming form had wasted away , and the frightful aspect of the demon of despair had chased the roses from her cheeks;—and thus , too , was an excellent lady dying prematurely with that worst of the Destroyer 's plagues — a broken heart ! "
952599	952920	952579	952580	My God	27430	" I approached my wife — I took her in my arms — I murmured , as I kissed her pale cheek , ' Can you — can you forgive me?'—'Oh ! have I ever reproached you , William ? ' she asked , endeavouring to smile in gratitude for my caresses.—'No : never , never , poor dear afflicted creature ! ' I exclaimed wildly ; ' and it is your resignation , your goodness which makes my conduct so black , so very black!'—She wound her arms about my neck , and said in her soft gentle tone , ' Will you not come and see my mother?'—I started back in horror . She comprehended me , and observed , ' Do not fear reproaches : but come with me , I conjure you!'—I took the hand which she extended to me : holy God ! how thin that hand had become — how skeleton - like had grown the taper fingers . Though it was my own wife 's hand I shuddered at the touch . She seemed to read my thoughts ; for she pressed my hand affectionately , and then wiped away her tears . A deep sob escaped her bosom — and she hurried me towards the sick - room . The children followed us without opposition on their mother 's part ; and in a few moments the mournful group approached the bed of death . I had not seen Mrs. Vandeleur for nearly a week ; and I was shocked — oh ! painfully shocked at the alteration which had taken place in her . From a fine , stout , handsome , healthy woman , she had wasted away to a mere shadow:—Julia was a shadow herself — but her mother seemed to be the shade of a shadow ! Merciful heavens ! and all this had been wrought by me ! "
953135	953317	953112	953112	Her	28639	" Heaven only knows how I passed the wretched night that followed . I remember that the dawn of a cold March morning , accompanied by a cheerless drizzling rain , found me pacing the parlour in a despairing manner . I do believe I was half mad . And such horrible ideas haunted me ! I thought of killing my wife and children , and then blowing out my own brains . Then I resolved to fly — and never see them more . In another minute I wept bitterly when I asked myself , ' But what would become of them ? ' I writhed in mental agony , as I found no response to this question ; and when I pictured to myself all the amiable qualities of my wife — her gentleness — her goodness — her endearments — her unimpaired love,—and then thought of the little innocents with their winning ways , their little tricks , their pretty sayings , and their cherub countenances,——Oh ! God , no words can explain how acute my sufferings were ! "
953708	953971	953702	953702	I	0	" For hours and hours did I wander about like a maniac — walking hastily along , without any defined object — and not even observing the crowds that passed me . Every thing was confused : bells seemed to be ringing in my very brain . It was dark when I thought of returning home ; and then I felt shocked at the idea of having deserted my poor wife and helpless children at such a time . My ideas were now more collected ; and I hastened to Russel Square . All was quiet in the house : but they were evidently still there — for a faint light gleamed through one of the shutters . I knocked with trembling hand . Tho door was immediately opened — by Julia . ' Oh ! thank God that you have come back ! ' she exclaimed , sinking half - fainting into my arms : ' you know not what horrible fears have oppressed me!'—I embraced her tenderly : never — never did she seem more dear to me ! The children also flocked around me ; and the tender word ' Papa ! ' wrung from me a flood of tears , which relieved me . I then made certain inquiries , and learnt the most heart - rending particulars . Every thing was sold and removed — even to the children 's little beds;—but the worst of all was that the corse of Julia 's mother lay upon the floor of the chamber where she had breathed her last ! "
954298	954692	954270	954296	the only one of all my late friends who would even read a letter that came from me — so utterly was I despised by them all	25041	" And now — will it be believed that , such was my infatuation in respect to play , I actually gambled with my fellow - prisoners — staking the money that had been obtained with so much difficulty to pay a lawyer to conduct my business in the Insolvents ' Court ! Yes — while my poor wife was sitting up nearly all night to earn a trifle with her needle or in painting maps,—while my children were dependent for their daily bread upon the exertions of their poor dying mother,—I — wretch that I was — lost the very means that were to restore me to them ! When the money had all disappeared , I became like a madman , and attempted to lay violent hands upon myself . I was taken to the infirmary of the prison , where I lay delirious with fever for six weeks . At the expiration of that time I recovered ; and the humanity of the governor of the gaol secured the services of a lawyer to file my petition and schedule in the Insolvents ' Court . The day of hearing came ; and I was discharged . But , alas ! I returned to the humble lodging occupied by my family without a hope — without resources . Nevertheless , the angel Julia received me with smiles ; and the children also smiled with their sickly , wan , and famished countenances . Then , in the course of a conversation which Julia endeavoured to render as little mournful as possible , I learnt that Colonel Beaumont had been persecuting her with his dishonourable offers,—that he had dogged her in her way to the prison when she went thither to see me,—that he had even intruded himself upon her in her poor dwelling of one back room ! Indeed , it was only in consequence of this visit that my wife mentioned the circumstance to me at all ; but so pure was her soul , that she could not keep secret from me an occurrence on which , did I hear it from stranger lips , a disagreeable construction might be placed . Ill — weak — dying as she was , she was still sweetly interesting;—and I could well understand how an unprincipled libertine might seek to possess her . "
954924	955306	955307	955307	I	0	" Six months after my release from prison the small - pox invaded the house in which we lodged ; and so virulent was the malady , that within three weeks it carried off two of my children — the girl , who was the eldest , and the younger boy . I need not attempt to describe my own grief nor the anguish of my wife . The blow was too much for her ; and she was thrown upon a sick bed . At the same time my employer failed in business ; and I accordingly lost my situation . I was returning home , one evening,—very miserable after several hours ' vain search for another place,—when I met a gentleman who had once been a brother - officer in the regiment in which I first served . I made known to him my deplorable situation , assuring him that both my wife and my only remaining child were at that moment lying dangerously ill , and that I was on my way home without a shilling to purchase even the necessaries of life . He said that he had no objection to serve me ; and , giving me a guinea for immediate wants , desired me to call on him next day at a particular address in Jermyn Street . I hastened joyfully home , and communicated my good fortune to poor Julia . On the following morning I repaired to Jermyn Street . My friend received me cordially , and then explained his views . To my profound surprise I learnt that he was the proprietor of a common gaming - house ; and his proposal was that I should receive three guineas a week for merely lounging about the play - rooms of an evening , and acting as a decoy to visitors . My situation was so desperate that I consented ; and ten guineas were given me on the spot to fit myself out in a becoming manner . I returned home ; and informed Julia that I had obtained the place of a night - clerk in a coach - office . She believed me : a smile played on her sickly countenance;—and she was soon afterwards able to leave her bed . "
955569	955762	955763	955763	I	0	" It was in the middle of winter : the snow lay upon the ground ; and the cold was intense . My poor wife — in the last stage of consumption , and with only a thin gown and a miserable rag of a shawl to cover her — clung to my arm , and even then attempted to console me . Oh ! God — what an angel was that woman ! We roved through the streets — for we dared not sit down on a door - step , through fear of being frozen to death ! What my feelings were , it is impossible to explain . Morning — the cold wintry morning — found us dragging our weary forms along the Dover Road . We had no object in proceeding that way ; but with tacit consent we seemed bent upon leaving a city where we had endured so much . At length Julia murmured in a faint tone , ' William , dearest , I can not move a step farther ! ' And she sank , half fainting , upon a bank covered with snow . "
956096	956247	956248	956259	The poor people at whose cottage my wife thus breathed her last	25084	" Her voice had gradually been growing fainter , and her articulation more difficult , as she uttered those loving words which Death rudely cut short . The medical man came : it was too late — all was over ! Then did I throw myself upon that senseless form , and accuse myself of having broken the heart of the best of women . Oh ! I thought , if I could only recall the past : if the last few years of my life could be spent over again — if my beloved wife , my little ones , and my fortune were still left to me — how different would my conduct be ! But repentance was too late : the work was done — and the consummation of the task of ruin , sorrow , and death was accomplished ! Wretch — wretch that I was ! "
956343	956594	956325	956325	her,—it	25086	" When I had followed the corpse of my poor wife to the grave , I returned to London ; and , assuming another name , procured a humble employment in the City . Would you believe , my lord , that one who had held the rank of a Field Officer became the follower of a bailiff — a catchpole — a sort of vampire feeding itself upon the vitals of the poor and unfortunate ? Yet such was my case : and even in that detestable capacity I experienced one day of unfeigned pleasure — one day of ineffable satisfaction ; and that was upon being employed to arrest and convey to Whitecross Street prison my mortal enemy — Colonel Beaumont . Yes : he also was ruined by play , and overwhelmed with difficulties . And at whose suit was he captured ? At that of Goldshig , the Jew ! The Colonel was playing at hide - and - seek ; but I tracked him out . Night and day did I pursue my inquiries until I learnt that he occupied a miserable lodging in the Old Bailey : and there was he taken . He languished for six months in prison — deserted by his friends — and compelled to receive the City allowance . Every Sunday during that period did I visit the gaol to gloat upon his miseries . At length he died in the infirmary , and was buried as a pauper ! "

957231	957232	957209	957212	the Prince of Montoni	23151	" "
957243	957248	957209	957212	the Prince of Montoni	23151	" replied Major Anderson . "
957280	957397	957270	957270	I	0	" The Prince was satisfied with this arrangement , and took his departure from the lodging of the ruined gamester . Reader ! there is no vice which is so fertile in the various elements of misery as Gambling ! While Major Anderson was engaged in relating his terribly impressive history to the Prince of Montoni , Lord Dunstable and Egerton were in earnest conversation together at the lodgings of the latter gentleman in Stratton Street . The fact was , that Albert Egerton was placed in a most cruel dilemma , as the following note , which he had received in the morning , will show : — — Pavement , March 28th , 1843 . "
957599	957604	957584	957584	You	25110	" Your loving aunt , "
957608	957609	957605	957606	BETSY BUSTARD	1848	" "
957618	957632	957633	957633	Egad	1849	" asked Egerton for the tenth time since the arrival of his friend . "
957648	957652	957635	957635	I	0	" replied Dunstable . "
957669	957670	957662	957662	you	0	" "
957673	957677	957678	957678	you	25110	" exclaimed Egerton : "
957719	957720	957748	957748	My	0	" "
957743	957747	957737	957737	you	25110	" suggested Dunstable . "
957759	957763	957748	957749	My aunt	9765	" returned Egerton . "
957821	957822	957854	957854	I	0	" "
957830	957834	957854	957854	I	0	" cried Dunstable . "
957839	957849	957854	957854	I	0	" he continued , a sudden idea striking him : "
957862	957885	957854	957854	I	0	" And his lordship seemed as overjoyed as if he himself were the individual who was unexpectedly released from a serious difficulty . "
957893	957899	957854	957854	I	0	" said Egerton , imploringly : "
957909	957910	957904	957904	you	0	" "
957924	957929	957911	957911	I	0	" returned the nobleman . "
958006	958007	957993	957995	an old gardener	25130	" "
958027	958033	958016	958016	you	0	" observed Egerton , impatiently . "
958040	958052	958053	958054	The gardener	7126	" ejaculated Lord Dunstable , slapping his friend upon the shoulder . "
958103	958104	958097	958097	you	0	" "
958112	958119	958105	958105	I	0	" returned Egerton , his countenance brightening up—"if
958128	958129	958105	958105	I	0	" "
958138	958142	958131	958131	you	0	" asked Dunstable . "
958150	958154	958131	958131	you	0	" replied Egerton . "
958183	958184	958185	958185	I	0	" "
958203	958211	958185	958185	I	0	" said Dunstable , rising to depart . "
958242	958278	958240	958240	you	0	" Egerton wrung his friend 's hand ; and the nobleman had already reached the door of the room , when he turned back as if a sudden recollection had struck him , and said , "
958328	958361	958309	958313	my agent in the country	25140	" Lord Dunstable 's estate was one of those pleasing fictions which exhibit the imaginative faculties of so many members of the aristocracy and gentry residing at the West End of London . "
958366	958379	958309	958313	my agent in the country	25140	" was Egerton 's prompt answer to the question put to him . "
958400	958401	958397	958397	you	0	" "
958416	958652	958411	958411	I	0	" said Dunstable ; and having received that sum in Bank - notes , he took his departure , humming an opera air . It is not necessary to detail the particulars of the young nobleman 's visit to Ravensworth Hall : suffice it to say that he was completely successful in his proposed arrangements with the gardener , and that he communicated this result to his friend Egerton at Long 's Hotel in the evening . Chichester , Cholmondeley , and Harborough were let into the secret ; and they insisted upon joining the party . Accordingly , on the following day Egerton sent a favourable reply to his aunt 's letter ; but his conscience reproached him — deeply reproached him , for the cheat which he was about to practise upon his confiding and affectionate relative . For , in spite of the dissipated courses which he was pursuing,—in spite of the gratification which his pride received from the companionship of his aristocratic acquaintances,—in spite of the lavish extravagance that marked his expenditure , this young man 's good feelings were not altogether perverted ; and it required but the timely interposition of some friendly hand to reclaim him from the ways that were hurrying him on to ruin ! The Monday fixed upon for the excursion arrived ; and at eleven o'clock in the forenoon a huge yellow barouche , commonly called "
958658	958787	958411	958411	I	0	" rattled up to the door of Mr. Egerton 's lodgings in Stratton Street . The driver of this vehicle had put on his best clothes , which were , however , of a seedy nature , and gave him the air of an insolvent coachman ; and the pair of horses which it was his duty to drive seemed as if they had been purchased at least six months previously by a knacker who had , nevertheless , mercifully granted them a respite during pleasure . Egerton 's countenance became as red as scarlet when this crazy equipage stopped at his door : but his four friends , who were all posted at the windows of his drawing - room , affected to consider the whole affair as "
958795	959029	958411	958411	I	0	" and thus the young man 's mind was somewhat calmed . By the side of the seedy coachman upon the box sate a tall , thin , red - haired young man , dressed in deep black , and with his shirt - collar turned down , over a neckerchief loosely tied , after the fashion of Lord Byron . The moment the glass - coach stopped in Stratton Street , down leapt the aforesaid seedy coachman on one side , and the thin young man on the other ; and while the seedy coachman played a nondescript kind of tune upon the knocker of the house , the young gentleman proceeded to hand out first Mrs. Bustard , and then her five daughters one after the other . This being done , and Egerton 's tiger having thrown open the front door , the thin young man offered one arm to Mrs. Bustard and the other to Miss Clarissa Jemima Bustard , and escorted them into the house , the four remaining young ladies following in a very interesting procession indeed . Egerton hastened to welcome his relatives ; but from the first moment that he had set his eyes upon the red - haired young man , he had entertained the most awful misgivings;—and those fears were fully confirmed when Mrs. Bustard introduced that same young man by the name of "
959041	959138	959139	959141	an old acquaintance	25145	" The son and heir of the wealthy tripe - man tendered a hand which felt as flabby as tripe itself ; and Miss Clarissa Jemima was under the necessity of blushing deeply at her mamma 's allusion to her contemplated change of situation . Egerton gave Mr. Tedworth Jones the tip of his fore - finger , and then conducted the party up stairs to the drawing - room , where the ceremony of introducing his City relatives to his West End friends took place . Lord Dunstable was most gallant in claiming Mrs. Bustard as "
959143	959222	959139	959141	an old acquaintance	25145	" and he even overcame his aristocratic prejudices so far as to shake hands with Mr. Tedworth Jones . Then the young ladies were introduced in due order ; and , though they giggled with each other a great deal , and were dressed in very flaunting colours , they were all very good - looking ; and this circumstance rendered Lord Dunstable , Sir Rupert Harborough , Colonel Cholmondeley , and Mr. Chichester particularly agreeable towards them . "
959225	959247	959264	959264	mamma	8688	" exclaimed Mrs. Bustard , throwing herself into an arm - chair , and wiping the perspiration from her fat face , "
959258	959259	959260	959262	Glass - coach	25147	" "
959266	959274	959264	959264	mamma	8688	" said Miss Susannah Rachel , reprovingly . "
959283	959288	959280	959281	my dear	26653	" returned Mrs. Bustard . "
959340	959341	959309	959309	I	0	" "
959359	959369	959350	959350	madam	26758	" said Mr. Chichester , with an affable smile . "
959381	959430	959371	959373	the old lady	3304	" whispered Sir Rupert Harborough to Colonel Cholmondeley . But Mr. Chichester 's observation had made all the young ladies giggle , with the exception of Miss Clarissa Jemima , who blushed , and whispered to Mr. Jones something about such a remark being very unpleasant for a person "
959435	959458	959371	959373	the old lady	3304	" Mr. Jones cast a sentimental glance upon his intended , and sighed very poetically as he assured Miss Clarissa that she was "
959462	959463	959371	959373	the old lady	3304	" "
959472	959481	959469	959470	Al dear	25154	" asked Mrs. Bustard , after a pause ; "
959505	959506	959490	959490	I	0	" "
959523	959534	959513	959513	I	0	" replied Egerton , with miserable attempt at a joke . "
959546	959547	959538	959538	you	29369	" "
959558	959576	959552	959552	I	0	" hastily interposed Lord Dunstable , who perceived that his young friend was very far from happy . "
959652	959783	959623	959626	the Colonel 's phaeton	25159	" Scarcely were these words uttered when the four - in - hand and the phaeton alluded to , dashed up the street ; and the tiger entered to announce their arrival . Egerton immediately offered his arm to his aunt , well knowing that if he did not take care of her no one else would : Mr. Tedworth Jones escorted his intended ; Lord Dunstable took one of the young ladies under his protection ; and the three others of course fell respectively to the lot of Colonel Cholmondeley , Sir Rupert Harborough , and Mr. Chichester . A fair and equitable distribution of the party took place between the three vehicles ; and the cavalcade moved rapidly away in a northern direction , Mrs. Bustard assuring her nephew "
959805	960037	959623	959626	the Colonel 's phaeton	25159	" The gentlemen were very agreeable , and the young ladles very amiable — although they every now and then simpered and giggled without much apparent cause ; but then it must be recollected that they suddenly found themselves for the first time in their lives in the company of a Lord , a Baronet , and two Honourables , one of whom moreover was a Colonel . The day was very fine : the air was as mild as if it were the month of May instead of March ; and the whole party were in excellent spirits — for even Egerton recovered his natural gaiety when he saw that the affair was likely to pass off without any of those annoyances which he had feared would arise from the collision of Finsbury denizens and West End fashionables . At length the open country was gained ; and in due time the stately pile of Ravensworth Hall appeared in the distance . Nothing could equal the gratification which Mrs. Bustard and the five Misses Bustard experienced when the edifice was pointed out to them as Egerton 's country - seat ; and , without pausing to reflect how incompatible were his means with such a grand mansion , they felt no small degree of pride at the idea of claiming the proprietor of Ravensworth Hall as their own near relation . "
960043	960066	959623	959626	the Colonel 's phaeton	25159	" whispered Miss Clarissa to Mr. Jones , who would insist on keeping her hand locked in his during the whole ride . "
960073	960079	960083	960083	you	25165	" replied the enamoured swain ; "
960085	960175	960083	960083	you	25165	" Miss Clarissa blushed for the thirtieth time that morning ; and , as if the squeeze of the hand which Mr. Jones gave her as a proof of his undivided affection were not sufficient , he planted his boot upon her foot at the same time . This is , however , so common a token of love in all civilised and enlightened countries , that Miss Clarissa Jemima received it as such , although the tender pressure somewhat impaired the snow - white propriety of her stocking . "
960183	960200	960083	960083	you	25165	" exclaimed Miss Susannah Rachel Bustard , as the three carriages now swept through Ravensworth Park . "
960203	960209	960083	960083	you	25165	" said another Miss Bustard . "
960217	960238	960215	960215	ladies	29329	" observed Colonel Cholmondeley , who was seated in the same vehicle with two of Mrs. Bustard 's fair daughters . "
960252	960281	960250	960250	Al	1045	" said the good lady herself , as she thrust her head from the window of the glass - coach , and surveyed the building with ineffable satisfaction . "
960295	960296	960250	960250	Al	1045	" "
960308	960312	960306	960306	aunt	29369	" replied Egerton . "
960317	960323	960306	960306	aunt	29369	" cried the enraptured lady . "
960326	960330	960306	960306	aunt	29369	" said Egerton : "
960353	960354	960306	960306	aunt	29369	" "
960361	960368	960306	960306	aunt	29369	" exclaimed Mrs. Bustard , joyfully . "
960401	960498	960398	960398	I	0	" The three carriages now stopped before the entrance of the Hall ; and Lord Dunstable 's lacquey gave a furious ring at the bell . In a short time one of the folding - doors was slowly opened to a distance of about a foot , and an old man , wearing a strange brown wig surmounted by a paper cap , thrust his head forth . Then , having surveyed the party with a suspicious air for some moments , he opened the door a little wider and revealed the remainder of his form . "
960505	960516	960501	960503	my good fellow	27449	" ejaculated Dunstable , as he rushed up the steps ; "
960538	960567	960601	960601	him	25176	" This was intended as a hint to make the gardener aware of the particular individual who was to be passed off as the owner of Ravensworth Hall . "
960572	960598	960601	960601	him	25176	" said the man , in a drawling tone , as he took off the paper cap , and made a bow to the company ; "
960636	960637	960619	960619	he	25176	" "
960643	960648	960649	960649	you	0	" hastily interposed Dunstable , "
960658	960659	960649	960649	you	0	" "
960666	960672	960662	960662	I	0	" continued the old man ; "
960681	960682	960683	960683	Thieves	2899	" "
960685	960690	960683	960683	Thieves	2899	" cried Lord Dunstable : "
960705	960706	960683	960683	Thieves	2899	" "
960711	960749	960683	960683	Thieves	2899	" said the gardener , turning a quid of tobacco from one side of his mouth to another , so that a swelling which at first appeared in his left cheek was suddenly transferred to the right ; "
960788	960847	960848	960848	My	0	" Dunstable cut short the old man 's garrulity by inquiring if the baskets , that were sent on the previous day , had arrived ; and , on receiving a round - about reply in the misty verbosity of which he perceived an affirmative , the nobleman desired Egerton to do the honours of his new mansion . "
960852	960895	960848	960850	My good man	27359	" said Mrs. Bustard , advancing in a stately fashion towards the gardener , who had replaced the paper cap on his head , and had tucked up his dirty apron , so that it looked like a reefed sail hanging to his waist,—"my
960979	961036	961037	961037	My	0	" The gardener was a little , shrivelled , stolid - looking old man ; and there was something so ludicrous in the way in which he stared at Mrs. Bustard as she thus addressed him , that Cholmondeley and Chichester were compelled to turn aside to prevent themselves from bursting into a roar of laughter . "
961041	961062	961037	961037	My	0	" said Dunstable , hastening forward to the rescue — for Egerton was trembling like a leaf through the fear of exposure,—"this
961088	961089	961075	961076	her nephew	48907	" "
961094	961104	961075	961076	her nephew	48907	" cried Mrs. Bustard , struck by this observation ; "
961130	961131	961119	961119	one	2053	" "
961136	961143	961119	961119	one	2053	" said Lord Dunstable , hastily ; "
961156	961157	961119	961119	one	2053	" "
961162	961171	961172	961172	his	25203	" observed Egerton , in a faint tone , "
961177	961178	961172	961172	his	25203	" "
961186	961191	961184	961184	ma'am	26745	" said the gardener : "
961245	961346	961234	961234	you	27359	" But Dunstable hastened to cut short this somewhat disagreeable scene,—which , by the way , never would have occurred , had he adopted the precaution of previously ascertaining the name of the gardener,—by desiring Mr. Abraham Squiggs to lead the way into the drawing - room prepared to receive the company . This request was complied with ; and the old man slowly proceeded up the marble staircase , followed by the whole party . Mrs. Bustard and her daughters were highly delighted at the splendid appearance of the mansion ; and their joy was expressed by repeated exclamations of "
961347	961349	961351	961351	I	0	Beautiful!"—"Charming!"—"Quite a palace!"—"Well
961352	961356	961234	961234	you	27359	never!"—"Oh ! the sweet place!"—and
961364	961377	961379	961381	the old gardener	25206	" Ah ! this here mansion has seen a many strange things , "
961400	961423	961384	961384	he	25206	" this wery room is the one where Mr. Gilbert Vernon throwed his - self out of winder about two years ago . "
961424	961432	961434	961435	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" Threw himself out of the window ! "
961437	961446	961434	961435	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" and what did he do that for ? "
961447	961456	961458	961460	the old man	2222	" To kill his - self , ma'am , "
961462	961545	961458	961460	the old man	2222	" I was n't here at the time : I 'd gone down into the country to see a garden that a friend o ' mine manured with some stuff that he bought in a jar at the chemist's — about a pint of it to a acre . Ah ! it 's a wonderful thing , to be sure , to be able to carry manure enow for a whole garden in your veskit - pocket , as one may say . "
961546	961562	961564	961565	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" But you was speaking about a gentleman who threw himself out of the window ? "
961569	961576	961578	961579	the gardener	7126	" Ah ! so I were , "
961581	961632	961578	961579	the gardener	7126	" It was told in the newspapers at the time ; but no partickler cause was given . Oh ! there was a great deal of mystery about all that business ; and I do n't like to say much on it , 'cos Mr. Vernon is knowed to walk . "
961633	961638	961642	961645	the ladies and gentlemen	25211	" Known to walk ! "
961656	961659	961661	961662	the gardener	7126	" Yes , "
961672	961729	961661	961662	the gardener	7126	" Gilbert Vernon sleeps in a troubled grave ; and his sperret wanders about the mansion of a night . If it was n't that me and my wife is old and friendless , and must go to the workus if we had n't this place , we 'd not sleep another night in Ravensworth Hall . "
961730	961737	961739	961740	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" Why , my dear Al ! "
961763	961776	961739	961740	Mrs. Bustard	1833	windows,—"you have gone and bought a haunted house , I do declare ! "
961777	961782	961784	961787	the tripeman 's son	25214	" How charmingly poetical ! "
961793	961803	961784	961787	the tripeman 's son	25214	" only think , dearest — a haunted house ! "
961804	961815	961739	961740	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" Yes , Tedworth — I do indeed think — — "
961816	961822	961824	961826	the sentimental swain	25215	" What ? beloved one ! "
961828	961841	961843	961845	the young lady	4262	" That I hope we shall leave it before it grows dusk , "
961858	961863	961865	961865	Egerton	1818	" My dear aunt , "
961880	961914	961865	961865	Egerton	1818	" I am not so silly as to be frightened by tales of ghosts and spirits ; and I would as soon sleep in this room as in any other throughout the mansion . "
961915	961933	961935	961936	the gardener	7126	" No , you would n't , young man — no , indeed , you would n't ! "
961976	962031	961957	961958	the gentlemen	4703	" I say , sir , that you would not like to sleep in this room — for , as sure as there is a God above us , have me and my wife seen the sperret of Gilbert Vernon standing at dusk in that very balcony which he throwed his - self from . "
962032	962037	962039	962042	all the young ladies	49376	" Dear ! dear ! "
962045	962052	962054	962055	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" And what was he like ? "
962057	962062	962064	962065	the gardener	7126	" Why , ma'am , "
962067	962126	962064	962065	the gardener	7126	" he was dressed all in deep black ; but his face were as pale as a corpse 's ; and when the moonbeams fell on it , me and my wife could see that it was the face of a dead man as well as I can see e'er a one of you at this present speaking . "
962127	962139	962141	962142	Lord Dunstable	1539	" Egad ! you have bought a nice property , Egerton , "
962150	962165	962141	962142	Lord Dunstable	1539	" I shall propose that we return to London again before it grows dusk . "
962166	962175	962177	962177	Egerton	1818	" Decidedly — since you are so disposed , "
962219	962231	962233	962235	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" ' Pon my honour , all this is vastly entertaining ! "
962237	962254	962233	962235	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" But how long ago was it that you saw the ghost , my good friend ? "
962255	962260	962262	962264	the old man	2222	" How long ago ? "
962268	962501	962262	962264	the old man	2222	" why , I have seen it a matter of fifty — or , may be a hundred times . The fust time , me and my wife was together : we had been across the fields to a farm - house to get some milk , butter , and what not ; and we was a - coming home through the Park , when we see a dark object in the balcony there . My wife looks — and I looks — and sure enow there it were.—'What do you think it is ? ' says she.—'I think it 's a thief , ' says I.—'No it ai n't , ' say she : ' it do n't move ; and a thief would n't stand there to amuse his - self . '—'No more he would , ' says I : ' let 's go near , for no one wo n't harm two poor old creaturs like us . ' And we went close under the balcony , and looked up ; but never shall I forget , or my old ' ooman either , the awful pale face that stared down upon us ! Then we recollected that that wery balcony was the one which Mr. Vernon had throwed his - self from ; and that was enow for us . We knowed we had seen his sperret ! "
962502	962513	962515	962516	Miss Clarissa	1385	" Oh ! dear , if it should come now ! "
962545	962564	962566	962567	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" Well — this is what I call a leetle dilemmy that you 're got into , Albert , "
962569	962582	962566	962567	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" for you 'll never be able to live in this place . "
962583	962603	962605	962606	the gardener	7126	" And no one else — unless it is such poor old helpless creaturs as me and my wife , "
962608	962656	962605	962606	the gardener	7126	" Since the fust time we see the sperret — and that 's near a year and a half ago — we've seen him a many , many times ; but he do n't hurt us — we've got used to him , as one may say . "
962657	962668	962670	962671	Colonel Cholmondeley	1541	" If this be the room that your ghost frequents , "
962673	962697	962670	962671	Colonel Cholmondeley	1541	" why did you select it for our reception to - day , since there are so many other apartments in the mansion ? "
962717	962734	962736	962737	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" Oh ! do make him tell us why he chose this apartment of all others ! "
962742	962747	962749	962749	Egerton	1818	" My good fellow , "
962772	962789	962795	962796	the gardener	7126	mansion,—"my good fellow , did you not hear the question addressed to you by Colonel Cholmondeley ? "
962790	962793	962795	962796	the gardener	7126	" Yes , "
962800	962812	962814	962814	Egerton	1818	" Then , why — why do you not answer it ? "
962827	962845	962847	962849	the old gardener	25206	" Why — if you 're koorious to know , I han't no objection to tell you , "
962858	962928	962847	962849	the old gardener	25206	" You see , when the establishment was broke up just after Lady Ravensworth left the Hall on a sudden , and when her lawyer come down here to discharge the servants , except me and my wife , who was put in charge o ' the place , he goes through the whole building , has all the shutters shut , and locks up all the rooms — — "
962929	962937	962939	962939	Dunstable	1539	" Yes , yes — of course , "
962943	962963	962939	962939	Dunstable	1539	" because the mansion was to be sold just as it stood , with all the furniture in it . "
962964	962975	962977	962978	the gardener	7126	" But he give us the keys , in course , "
962980	963038	962977	962978	the gardener	7126	" on'y he told us to keep the rooms locked , and the shutters shut , when we was n't dusting or cleaning . Well , the wery next day arter we see the sperret in the balcony , me and my wife come up to this room together , and sure enow the shutters was open ! "
963039	963047	963049	963053	one of the young ladies	25238	" And they had been closed before ? "
963060	963070	963072	963074	the old man	2222	" As sure as you 're there , Miss , "
963076	963104	963072	963074	the old man	2222	" what I now tell you is as true as true can be . But the door was locked — and that made it more koorious still . "
963105	963128	963130	963131	Colonel Cholmondeley	1541	" It is clear that the shutters in this one particular room had been left open when all the others were closed , "
963151	963159	963161	963162	Abraham Squiggs	1851	" Well — and if they was , "
963179	963197	963236	963238	the old man	2222	veracity,—"me and my wife shut 'em up again , and locked the door when we went out . "
963198	963203	963205	963211	two or three of the Misses Bustard	25243	" And what followed ? "
963222	963234	963236	963238	the old man	2222	" Why , that next night the shutters was opened again , "
963279	963282	963284	963286	the old man	2222	" Yes , "
963302	963348	963294	963294	he	2222	" and from that moment till now I 've never set foot in this here drawing - room . But the sperret is often here ; for sometimes the shutters stays open for two or three days — sometimes they 're closed for weeks together . "
963349	963370	963372	963372	Egerton	1818	" But what has all that to do with your bringing us to this very room on the present occasion ? "
963381	963396	963398	963399	the gardener	7126	" Now do n't be angry , sir , and I 'll tell you , "
963416	963569	963403	963403	he	7126	" The shutters has been shut for a matter of three weeks up to last night ; and so when I see 'em open agen , I says to my wife , says I , ' Now 's the time to see what the sperret raly wants , and why he troubles that room . There 's a power of fine folks a - coming to - morrow , ' says I ; ' and we 'll just put 'em in the haunted - room . If so be the sperret shows his - self , they 're sure to speak to him ; and may be he 'll tell them why he walks . '—'Do so , ' says my old o'oman : and by rights I should n't have said a word about the sperret at all;—but it come out some how or another ; and now you know all . "
963570	963588	963590	963591	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" And we are very much obleeged , indeed , for being put into a haunted room , "
963596	963606	963608	963608	Cholmondeley	1541	" Oh ! the joke is a capital one ! "
963610	963636	963608	963608	Cholmondeley	1541	" and we will stay here by all means . If the ladies should be frightened , the gentlemen must take them upon their knees . "
963637	963647	963649	963650	Clarissa Jemima	1385	" Oh ! this before one in my situation ! "
963655	963664	963666	963670	the poetical tripe - man	25256	" It is too bad , my charmer , "
963732	963741	963743	963743	Egerton	1818	" Pray be seated , ladies and gentlemen , "
963755	963777	963743	963743	Egerton	1818	" and excuse me for a few minutes while I ascertain that every thing necessary for your entertainment has been provided . "
963928	963952	963954	963956	the old lady	3304	" Fine turkey , stuffed with black things — truffles I 've heerd 'em called by the cooks that used to be here , "
963974	964084	963954	963956	the old lady	3304	" glorious ham — four cold chicken — and tongues , reg'lar picturs ! Two could pies — weal and ham most likely — leastways , unless one 's beef . Six lobsters — flask of ile — and bottle of winegar . But what 's this heavy feller ? Cold round of biled beef;—and here 's a blessed quarter of lamb . They 'll want mint - sarse for that . What next ? Four great German sassages — excellent eating , I 'll bet a penny ! No end of bread — half a Cheshire cheese — whole Stilton — and that 's all in this basket . "
964207	964322	964195	964197	the young man	2266	" My friend Lord Dunstable gave you five pounds the other day as a slight recompense for your civility in allowing me the use of the Hall on this occasion . Here is another five - pound note for you ; but pray be upon your guard should either of the ladies take it into their heads to question you concerning my right to this property . I , however , perceive that you are well disposed to aid me in this little innocent cheat upon my relations ; and I really give you great credit for the ghost - story which you told to get rid of them all as soon as possible . "
964323	964332	964334	964335	the gardener	7126	" Thank'ee kindly for the money , sir , "
964337	964367	964334	964335	the gardener	7126	" but as I 'm a living sinner which hopes to be saved , every word I said up stairs about the sperret is as true as the Gospel . "
964368	964371	964373	964373	Egerton	1818	" Ridiculous ! "
964375	964395	964373	964373	Egerton	1818	" you can not seriously believe in such a thing ? Who ever heard of ghosts in these times ? "
964396	964401	964403	964404	the man	2092	" Well , sir , "
964411	964435	964403	964404	the man	2092	" do n't let 's talk any more about it—'cos it might bring bad luck to disbelieve in ghosts where a ghost walks . "
964736	964741	964743	964745	Mr. Tedworth Jones	937	" For my part , "
964747	964816	964743	964745	Mr. Tedworth Jones	937	" I believe every word that the old man uttered . Love , poetry , and ghosts seem to me to go together . For what is love , unless the lover who loses her whom he loves , can soothe the agony of his mind by the conviction that she — the dear lost one — is ever near him in the shape of a disembodied spirit ? "
964839	964854	964858	964859	Clarissa Jemima	1385	" How sweet you do talk , to be sure , my dear Tedworth ! "
964861	964867	964868	964868	she	1385	" It was your conversation , "
964876	964886	964868	964868	she	1385	" that first made an impression upon my heart . "
964887	964898	964900	964901	Mr. Jones	937	" And did my poetry have no influence , dearest ? "
964925	964938	964940	964941	this gentleman	2368	" Ah ! now I have found you out , Mr. Jones ! "
964963	965006	964950	964950	his	2368	" you 're a poet — eh ? Well — I thought so from the very first . In fact you have the air of a poet — you wear your collar like a poet — you look altogether like a poet . "
965084	965097	965099	965100	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" And I can assure you that they are very pretty too , "
965114	965130	965132	965133	Mr. Chichester	886	" But you should print them , my dear sir — you should print them , "
965135	965148	965132	965133	Mr. Chichester	886	" Let the world welcome you at once as a great poet . "
965149	965152	965154	965156	Mr. Tedworth Jones	937	" Well , "
965187	965200	965132	965133	Mr. Chichester	886	" I did venture to print little piece a few weeks ago . "
965201	965204	965206	965206	Chichester	886	" Indeed ! "
965215	965223	965206	965206	Chichester	886	" in some periodical , I presume ? "
965224	965255	965257	965258	Mr. Jones	937	" No — it was to have been struck off on a few sheets of gilt - edged paper — just to circulate privately amongst my friends , you know , "
965260	965286	965257	965258	Mr. Jones	937	" but really the compositors made such an awful mull of the first proof that I never had the courage to let them go on ! "
965287	965295	965297	965297	Chichester	886	" That was a very great pity , "
965299	965316	965318	965319	Mr. Jones	937	" I can show you the original copy and the first proof , if you like , "
965321	965341	965318	965319	Mr. Jones	937	" and you may then judge for yourself how far I was justified in being angry with the printers . "
965390	965395	965364	965365	Mr. Jones	937	" in her situation . "
965452	965456	965503	965504	Mr. Chichester	886	" in her situation "
965523	965540	965542	965543	Mr. Jones	937	" I think you will grant that the printers made a slight mull of my writing ? "
965557	965568	965570	965571	this gentleman	2368	" Yes — a slight mull , as you observe , "
965592	965623	965570	965571	this gentleman	2368	" But it is impossible to feel any annoyance at that strange assemblage of misconceptions on the part of the printer , since the original itself is so perfectly beautiful . "
965624	965633	965635	965636	Clarissa Jemima	1385	" Oh ! yes — so very charming ! "
965669	965675	965677	965679	Miss Susannah Rachel	1832	" Well , I declare , "
965685	965716	965677	965679	Miss Susannah Rachel	1832	" I do n't think I shall ever again be able to sleep without a light in the room , after all that has been told us about the ghost . "
965717	965730	965787	965790	the fifth Miss Bustard	1832	" And I shall always cover my head over with the clothes , "
965740	965746	965748	965750	the fourth daughter	25314	" I 've been told , "
965752	965774	965748	965750	the fourth daughter	25314	" that a horse - shoe nailed to the door of a room will prevent evil spirits from passing the threshold . "
965775	965785	965787	965790	the fifth Miss Bustard	1832	" Or sleep with a Bible under your pillow , "
965792	965801	965787	965790	the fifth Miss Bustard	1832	" That 's all very well , gals , "
965811	965837	965787	965790	the fifth Miss Bustard	1832	" but ghostesses wo n't be kept away by such means as them . Where there 's evil spirits , there evil spirits will be . "
965838	965847	965849	965850	Lord Dunstable	1539	" Nothing can possibly be clearer , madam , "
965852	965863	965865	965866	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" And if they must walk , they will walk , "
965868	965877	965865	965866	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" Your arguments are really admirable , madam . "
965878	965905	965907	965908	the lady	2373	" And so it 's of no use bothering oneself about it — beyond getting away as soon as possible from the place where ghostesses are , "
965910	965929	965931	965932	the nobleman	3005	" Were you of the other sex , madam , I should say you had graduated at Oxford , "
965934	965945	965931	965932	the nobleman	3005	" for you reason with all the logic of Euclid . "
965946	965959	965961	965962	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" Is Mr. Euclid such a very clever man , my lord ? "
966112	966119	966121	966122	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" Well , my dear Albert , "
966131	966171	966121	966122	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" I admire the edifisk and I admire the gardens very much ; but I do n't like the evil spirit . You 'll never be happy in this lonely place until you marry , and have a companion . "
966172	966175	966177	966177	Egerton	1818	" Marry ! "
966204	966213	966215	966215	his	25328	" Yes — marry , to be sure ! "
966223	966254	966215	966215	his	25328	" Let me see — I think I could make up an excellent match for you . What should you say to Miss Posselwaithe , the great paviour 's daughter ? "
966255	966262	966264	966265	Lord Dunstable	1539	" Oh ! my dear madam , "
966267	966317	966264	966265	Lord Dunstable	1539	" your nephew may look somewhat higher than a paviour 's daughter . I intend that he shall marry a lady of title as well as of fortune . Only think how well it will sound in the Morning Herald—'Mr . and Lady Egerton , of Ravensworth Park . ' "
966318	966327	966329	966330	the aunt	48911	" So it would — so it would ! "
966368	966373	966264	966265	Lord Dunstable	1539	" the haunted room ; "
966647	966650	966628	966628	he	937	" Clarissa , "
966661	966663	966656	966657	the poet	27850	" miss her;"—and
966686	966691	966675	966675	she	4262	" in her situation . "
966718	966725	966727	966729	the old gardener	25206	" merry as a marriage bell , "
966760	966767	966756	966756	his	25206	" A corpse ! a corpse ! "
966853	966860	966861	966861	he	2222	" A corpse ! a corpse ! "
966869	966880	966882	966882	Egerton	1818	" What in the name of heaven do you mean ? "
967495	967503	967505	967506	the stranger	2298	" Some foul deed has been committed , "
967508	967527	967505	967506	the stranger	2298	" but I have always heard and read that God will sooner or later bring murder to light . "
967528	967541	967543	967545	the old gardener	25206	" Ah ! and that 's true enow , I 'll warrant ! "
967547	967593	967543	967545	the old gardener	25206	" The body which that hand belongs to , was no doubt buried deep ; but the rains overflowed yonder pond , and the water made itself a way along here , you see — so that it has hollered the earth out several foot . "
967594	967604	967606	967607	the stranger	2298	" Well — it 's of no use talking , "
967609	967639	967606	967607	the stranger	2298	" but make haste and dig down here , old gentleman — so that we may see whether the hand has an arm , and the arm a body . "
967835	967847	967849	967850	the stranger	2298	" Here 's work for the Coroner , at all events , "
967857	967870	967849	967850	the stranger	2298	" We must move the body to the big house there — — "
967871	967879	967881	967883	the old gardener	25206	" Move the body to the Hall ! "
967901	967907	967909	967910	the stranger	2298	" Yes — most certainly , "
967912	967980	967981	967982	The gardener	7126	" Would you leave a Christian — as I hope that poor woman was — to be devoured by rats and other vermin ? I might have done so once : but , thank God ! I have become a better man since then . Howsomever , get us a plank or two , old gentleman ; and we 'll do our duty in a proper manner . "
968124	968131	968133	968134	the stranger	2298	" What is the matter now ? "
968136	968141	968143	968144	the gardener	7126	" Why , sir , "
968151	968198	968143	968144	the gardener	7126	" me and my wife has been a - thinking together that it would be as well to put the remains of that poor creetur as far from our own rooms as possible : 'cos what with a sperret here and a dead body there — — "
968199	968207	968209	968210	the stranger	2298	" Well , well — old man , "
968214	968250	968209	968210	the stranger	2298	" this load is heavy , and I for one shall be glad to put it down somewhere . So leave off chattering uselessly — and tell us in a word what you do mean . "
968251	968256	968258	968259	the gardener	7126	" To be sure , "
968261	968268	968258	968259	the gardener	7126	" this way — this way . "
968304	968316	968318	968319	the stranger	2298	" We never can get up that staircase , old gentleman , "
968330	968348	968350	968351	the gardener	7126	" It 's easier than you think — the stairs is n't so steep as they seem , "
968353	968359	968360	968360	he	7126	" and what 's more , "
968365	968384	968360	968360	he	7126	" you may either bring your burden this way , or leave it in the open air altogether . "
968385	968390	968393	968395	the old woman	26813	" To be sure , "
968397	968438	968393	968395	the old woman	26813	" if you do n't choose to put the body in the very farthermost room from our end of the building , you may take it back again ; and them stairs leads to the room that is farthermost off . "
968540	968550	968552	968553	the gardener	7126	" Put it down there — on the carpet , "
968624	968632	968599	968601	the old man	2222	" Hark ! there 's a footstep ! "
968633	968641	968643	968644	his wife	27679	" Yes — I hear it too ! "
968661	968668	968658	968658	she	27679	" There — there — there ! "
968685	968694	968696	968697	the gardener	7126	" At the end of the passage — — "
968699	968706	968708	968709	his wife	27679	" Do you see any thing ? "
968715	968727	968729	968730	the man	2092	" No — but it 's certain to be the sperret , "
968888	968895	968878	968878	he	7126	" A corpse ! a corpse ! "
968909	968912	968878	968878	he	7126	" Fire ! "
968938	968945	968878	968878	he	7126	" A corpse ! a corpse ! "
969367	969375	969377	969377	Dunstable	1539	" This is a most extraordinary thing , "
969407	969429	969400	969400	he	1539	" Does not the strange discovery just made remind you of something that I mentioned to you nearly two years ago ? "
969430	969434	969436	969437	the Colonel	30185	" I recollect ! "
969439	969450	969400	969400	he	1539	" you allude to the mysterious disappearance of Lydia Hutchinson . "
969451	969455	969457	969458	the nobleman	3005	" I do , "
969460	969473	969400	969400	he	1539	" That event occurred while I was lying wounded in this house . "
969474	969486	969488	969489	the gardener	7126	" Ah ! I heerd of it , to be sure ! "
969491	969518	969488	969489	the gardener	7126	" But I was down in the country when all them things took place — I was there for some months . Do you think — — "
969519	969527	969529	969529	Dunstable	1539	" No — it could not be ! "
969531	969551	969529	969529	Dunstable	1539	" for it was well known at the time that Lydia decamped with Lady Ravensworth 's jewel - box . "
969643	969649	969651	969653	the old gardener	25206	" As your lordship says , "
969667	969710	969663	969663	himself	25206	" it ca n't have any thing to do with that young o'oman who was here a few weeks as my lady 's maid—'cos it 's well knowed that she bolted off with the jewel - casket , as your lordship says . "
969735	969787	969712	969712	Cholmondeley	1541	" Let us leave this matter where it is . Should the body just discovered be really that of Lydia Hutchinson , who disappeared so strangely , it would be very annoying for us to have to explain to a Coroner 's jury all we know about her and Lady Ravensworth . "
969788	969792	969794	969794	Dunstable	1539	" Truly so , "
969796	969809	969794	969794	Dunstable	1539	" And , after all , it is no affair of ours . "
970039	970060	970030	970030	his	2298	" Well met , I declare ! You 're the very identical men I 've long been wanting to see ! "
970088	970096	970098	970099	the baronet	26709	" Ah ! my good friend Talbot ! "
970114	970125	970098	970099	the baronet	26709	" upon my honour I am delighted to see you ! "
970126	970140	970142	970142	Chichester	886	" So am I — quite charmed to find you looking so well ! "
970144	970154	970156	970159	the individual thus addressed	25514	" No thanks to either of you , howsomever , "
970174	970218	970156	970159	the individual thus addressed	25514	" But you know as well as I do that my name is n't Talbot at all ; it 's Bill Pocock — and , I may add , too , without telling a lie , that it 's now honest Bill Pocock . "
970219	970226	970228	970228	Chichester	886	" Well , my dear Pocock , "
970238	970267	970228	970228	Chichester	886	" I am really quite happy to see you . But we will step out into the garden , and just talk over a few little matters — — "
970268	970273	970275	970276	the gardener	7126	" Oh ! gentlemen , "
970283	970312	970275	970276	the gardener	7126	" you 're quite welcome to step into our little parlour t'other side of the passage — if so be you have any thing private to talk about . "
970313	970323	970325	970325	Chichester	886	" Thank you — that will exactly suit us , "
970399	970437	970396	970396	Pocock	945	" So I find you two chaps still pursuing the old game . Got in with a young cit named Egerton — and all his relations — eh ? Pretty goings on , I 've no doubt . "
970438	970450	970452	970452	Chichester	886	" Only just in a friendly way , my dear fellow , "
970454	970472	970452	970452	Chichester	886	" But you stated that you had been looking for me and Harborough for a long time ? "
970473	970485	970487	970487	Pocock	945	" Yes — I was anxious enough to see you both , "
970489	970527	970487	970487	Pocock	945	" and I 'll tell you the reason why . You remember that night — some few years ago — when you two got such a precious walloping at the Dark House in Brick Lane , Spitalfields ? "
970528	970533	970535	970536	the baronet	26709	" Well — well , "
970538	970542	970535	970536	the baronet	26709	" go on . "
970543	970579	970487	970487	Pocock	945	" Oh ! I see you have n't forgot it ! You also know that on that same night the very young man whom we all ruined , was present — I mean Richard Markham . "
970580	970592	970594	970594	Chichester	886	" Yes — to be sure . But what of that ? "
970596	970621	970594	970594	Chichester	886	" Why — I gave him a paper , drawed up and signed by myself,—plain William Pocock , and none of your aristocratic Talbots . "
970622	970627	970629	970630	the baronet	26709	" And that paper ? "
970634	970649	970651	970651	Pocock	945	" Contained a complete confession of the whole business that brought him into trouble , "
970653	970764	970766	970766	Pocock	945	" But he pledged himself not to use it to my prejudice ; and that 's the reason why you never heard of it in a legal way . On that same occasion he put a fifty - pound note into my hand , saying , ' Accept this as a token of my gratitude and a proof of my forgiveness ; and endeavour to enter an honest path . Should you ever require a friend , do not hesitate to apply to me . '—Those was his words ; and they made a deep impression on me . Yes — gentlemen , and I did enter an honest path , "
970770	971066	970766	970766	Pocock	945	" and that money prospered me . I returned to my old business as an engraver — I left off going to public - houses — I worked hard , and redeemed my character with my old employers . Since that night at the Dark House all has gone well with me . I have never applied to my benefactor — because I have never required a friend . But I have prayed for him morning and evening — yes , gentlemen , prayed ! I know that this may sound strange in your ears : it is nevertheless true — and I am not ashamed to own it . And while that faultless young man was pursuing his glorious career in a foreign land , there was an obscure but grateful individual in London who wept over his first reverses , but who laughed , and sang , and danced for joy when the newspapers brought the tidings of his great battles . And that individual was myself : for he was my saviour — my guardian angel — my benefactor ! Instead of heaping curses upon me , he had spoken kind words of forgiveness and encouragement : instead of spurning me from his presence , he had given me money , and told me to look upon him as my friend ! My God ! such a man as that can save more souls and redeem more sinners than all the Bishops that ever wore lawn sleeves ! I adore his very name — I worship him — I am as proud of his greatness as if he was my own son ; and all Prince though he now is , did it depend upon me , he should wear a crown . "
971145	971148	971150	971150	Pocock	945	" Yes , "
971152	971271	971150	971150	Pocock	945	" all I possess in the world I owe to the Prince of Montoni . I am now at my ease — I live in my own house , bought with my own hard - earned money:—I can even afford to take a little pleasure , or an occasional ramble , as I was doing just now when accident brought me here . And , what is more , I always have a five - pound note to assist a friend . You can not wonder , then , if I worship the very name of that man who from a comparatively humble rank has raised himself to such a proud height by his valour and his virtues . "
971272	971290	971292	971292	Chichester	886	" But what has all this to do with your anxiety to see the baronet and me ? "
971304	971309	971311	971311	Pocock	945	" A great deal , "
971313	971391	971311	971311	Pocock	945	" I only want an opportunity to show the Prince how grateful I am to him ; and for that reason have I looked out for you . Great , powerful , and rich as he now is , the memory of the past can not oppress him ; but still it would be satisfactory to his noble mind to receive from both of you the same confession of his innocence that he has had from me . "
971392	971395	971397	971398	the baronet	26709	" What ? "
971409	971418	971420	971420	Pocock	945	" Yes — you know what I mean , "
971422	971502	971420	971420	Pocock	945	" and you dare not refuse me . Although it is my duty , perhaps , to step up stairs and quietly explain to the people there what kind of acquaintances they have got in you , yet the honour of the Prince is uppermost with me ; and I will not expose you , if you at once write out and sign a paper saying that he was innocent and you was the guilty cause of his misfortunes . "
971503	971506	971508	971508	Harborough	887	" Impossible ! "
971510	971516	971518	971518	Chichester	886	" He would transport us ! "
971524	971533	971535	971536	the engraver	29561	" And no great harm if he did , "
971540	971564	971535	971536	the engraver	29561	" But consideration for me will prevent his punishing you . So if you value the friendship of your chums up stairs — — "
971565	971577	971579	971580	the baronet	26709	" It would never do to be shown up before them ! "
971596	971619	971621	971621	Chichester	886	" You will pledge yourself not to show to any one , save the Prince , the paper you require of us ? "
971626	971648	971650	971650	Pocock	945	" When once you 've given me that paper , I want to know nothing more of you or your pursuits , "
971777	971786	971788	971788	he	29561	" Now that this little business is settled , "
971790	971861	971788	971788	he	29561	" perhaps you two gentlemen will just allow me to observe that I have found an honest way of life much happier than a dishonest one , and quite as easy to pursue , if you only have the will ; but whether you 'll profit by this advice or not , is more than I can say — and certainly much more than I should like to answer for . "
972242	972246	972238	972239	the former	2255	" Lady Ravensworth ! "
972268	972299	972256	972256	he	25568	" Your ladyship is doubtless astonished to see so large a party at Ravensworth Hall ; but if you will permit me to speak to you five words in private — "
972300	972311	972313	972313	Adeline	1545	" I have no secrets to discuss with Colonel Cholmondeley , "
972370	972392	972367	972367	she	1833	" May I be permitted to inquire , madam , the meaning of this assembly on the day of my return ? "
972393	972407	972409	972410	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" If you 'll tell me fust , ma'am , who you are , "
972412	972420	972409	972410	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" may be I 'll satisfy you . "
972421	972427	972367	972367	she	1833	" I am Lady Ravensworth , "
972433	972485	972367	972367	she	1833	" Well then , my lady , all I can say is — and which I do on the part of my nephew Albert — that you 're quite welcome to occupy a room or two in this edifisk until such times as you can provide yourself with another place — — "
972486	972500	972502	972502	Egerton	1818	" My dear aunt , allow me to explain myself to Lady Ravensworth , "
972508	972516	972518	972519	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" Eh — do , my boy , "
972577	972591	972602	972602	he	1539	" Lady Ravensworth , permit me — one word , I implore you ! "
972607	972619	972621	972621	Adeline	1545	" Is this mystery to be explained to me at all ? "
972623	972684	972621	972621	Adeline	1545	" Lord Dunstable , I have no better reason to grant a private interview to you than to your friend Colonel Cholmondeley : I therefore hope that , without farther delay , you will inform me to what circumstance I am to attribute the honour which my poor mansion has experienced by receiving so large a party during my absence . "
972685	972691	972693	972694	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" Her mansion , indeed ! "
972731	972744	972746	972746	Egerton	1818	" Upon me must the weight of your ladyship 's anger fall , "
972763	972769	972771	972772	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" No such a thing ! "
972774	972799	972771	972772	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" What right has the lady to be angry ? Because her house was put up for sale , and you bought it — — "
972800	972809	972811	972811	Adeline	1545	" Abraham , will you explain this enigma ? "
972830	972836	972838	972840	the old man	2222	" Why , my lady , "
972859	972911	972838	972840	the old man	2222	" your ladyship sees these wery respectable folk — leastways , respectable as far as I know anythink to the contrairey,—for my maxim is , my lady — as I often says to my old ' ooman — says I — at such times when she says , says she — — "
972920	972933	972935	972936	the gardener	7126	" I 'm a - coming to the pint , my lady , "
972948	972991	972935	972936	the gardener	7126	" and in doing that , my lady , I must ax your ladyship 's pardon—'cos I 'm a poor simple old man which ca n't boast of much edication — leastways , as I says to my old ' ooman — — "
972992	972997	972999	972999	Adeline	1545	" This is insupportable ! "
973001	973026	972999	972999	Adeline	1545	" In one word , did you not receive my letter stating that it was my intention to return to the Hall this week ? "
973027	973040	973042	973043	the gardener	7126	" No , my lady — no such a letter ever come , "
973045	973069	973071	973071	Adeline	1545	" But you can perhaps inform me in two words how these ladies and gentlemen happened to honour my house with their presence ? "
973079	973085	973087	973088	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" Your house , ma'am ! "
973097	973121	973090	973090	her	1833	" no such a thing ! It 's my nephew's — he bought it — and he is here to tell you so ! "
973130	973135	973137	973139	the young man	2266	" My dear aunt , "
973147	973172	973137	973139	the young man	2266	" I have deceived you ! I am sorry for the cheat which I have practised upon you : but the truth is — — "
973173	973181	973183	973184	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" Do n't tell me no more ! "
973186	973249	973183	973184	Mrs. Bustard	1833	" I see it all . It 's a hoax — a shameful hoax ! And I should n't wonder if your Lord and your Baronet and your Honourables are all as Brummagem as your title to this edifisk . Come , Tedworth — come , gals : let 's get back to the Pavement . This is no place for us . "
974770	974773	974775	974776	Lady Adeline	1545	" Abraham , "
974778	974904	974775	974776	Lady Adeline	1545	" there are certain circumstances which render my return to this house far from pleasant . Almost heart - broken by the loss of that dear , dear child who constituted my only earthly joy , I come back to my native land with the hope of at least finding tranquillity and peace in the retirement of Ravensworth Hall . But scarcely do I alight from my carriage , when I encounter upon the very threshold of my home a party of revellers whom your imprudence permitted to celebrate their orgies within these walls . This fault I was inclined to pardon : but when , upon the first superficial glance around the principal apartments , I perceive that many valuable articles have disappeared — — "
974905	974911	974913	974915	the old man	2222	" Disappeared , my lady ! "
974929	974934	974913	974915	the old man	2222	" Yes , Abraham , "
974941	974971	974913	974915	the old man	2222	" pictures — ornaments — time - pieces — China bowls — and several objects of less value are missing from these apartments . Have you removed them elsewhere ? "
974972	974978	974980	974981	the gardener	7126	" Oh ! my lady , "
974983	975033	974980	974981	the gardener	7126	" you ca n't think that I would rob you ! As God is my judge , neither me nor my wife has touched a single thing in the place — leastways , unless it was to dust and clean 'em . The doors has been kept locked — — "
975034	975053	974913	974915	the old man	2222	" But if you have been in the habit of allowing strangers the use of these apartments — — "
975054	975080	975082	975084	the , gardener	25665	" No , my lady — this was the fust and the last time that me and my old ' ooman did such a thing , "
975088	975111	975082	975084	the , gardener	25665	" and we did n't know we was a - doing anythink so wery wrong — seeing your ladyship was n't here . "
975112	975127	975129	975129	Adeline	1545	" And you have not even observed that certain pictures and ornaments had disappeared ? "
975152	975163	974913	974915	the old man	2222	" Never , my lady — we never noticed it , "
975168	975216	974913	974915	the old man	2222	" For my part , I seldom come into these rooms at all : but my old ' ooman dusted 'em out reglar once a month or so ; and if she 'd missed anythink I should have knowed of it in a moment . But — — "
975217	975223	975225	975226	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" But what , Abraham ? "
975233	975264	975225	975226	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" There 's one circumstance that has troubled me and my wife more than once — or twice — or a dozen times , my lady : and yet — — "
975265	975274	975275	975277	The old man	2222	" Speak candidly . Why do you hesitate ? "
975299	975308	975296	975296	he	2222	" The Hall is troubled , my lady . "
975309	975315	975317	975317	Adeline	1545	" What do you mean ? "
975332	975341	975317	975317	Adeline	1545	" Explain yourself , old man — speak ! "
975342	975355	975357	975357	Abraham	1851	" Ah ! my lady — there 's no doubt on it ! "
975364	975379	975357	975357	Abraham	1851	" Mr. Vernon ca n't rest in his grave — his sperret walks — — "
975380	975388	975393	975393	her	1680	" A truce to this idle folly ! "
975516	975524	975525	975525	she	1680	" A truce to this idle folly ! "
975528	975551	975525	975525	she	1680	" and prepare yourself to give the explanations which my solicitor may require at your hands to - morrow . Leave me . "
975552	975559	975506	975506	she	1680	" I hope your ladyship — — "
975560	975575	975525	975525	she	1680	" Leave me , I say ; and send my maid up with lights . "
975576	975586	975525	975525	she	1680	" Yes , my lady — certainly I will , "
975601	975650	975525	975525	she	1680	" but before I go — I must acquaint your ladyship — leastways , I must in dooty state that — though it ai n't a wery pleasant thing — still it was n't my fault — as my old ' ooman can prove to your ladyship — — "
975651	975655	975657	975657	Adeline	1545	" Leave me ! "
975672	975751	975752	975752	she	1545	" If you have any apology to offer for your conduct — which , I regret to say , is now placed beyond all doubt by the confusion of your manner — you must satisfy my legal adviser upon that head . Fear not , however , that I will seek to punish an old man who can not have many years to remain in this world : no — I am not vindictive — my own sufferings , "
975760	975790	975752	975752	she	1545	" have taught me to be merciful to others . But I do not desire to prolong this conversation now . Leave me , I repeat — leave me ! "
976222	976233	976234	976234	she	1545	" I could wish that the evening were less gloomy , "
976239	976248	976234	976234	she	1545	" And how long Quentin seems to be ! "
976293	976301	976303	976303	Adeline	1545	" Still I wish he would come ! "
976305	976362	976363	976363	She	1545	" He is a faithful servant — and I should feel more secure were he near me . What can be this dreadful depression of spirits which I experience ? Alas ! happiness and I have long been strangers to each other : but never — never have I felt as I do to - night ! "
976579	976585	976587	976587	Adeline	1545	" Holy God protect me ! "
976650	976656	976644	976646	the Resurrection Man	3220	" What do you here ? "
976657	976663	976665	976665	Tidkins	998	" That 's my business , "
976669	976701	976702	976702	he	3220	" You see that I am here:—here I have been for a long time — and here I shall remain as much longer as it suits my purpose . That is , "
976710	976723	976702	976702	he	3220	" unless you make it worth my while to take myself off . "
976724	976728	976730	976730	Adeline	1545	" Detestable extortioner ! "
976732	976741	976702	976702	he	3220	" am I never to know peace again ? "
976742	976754	976756	976758	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Well — now that 's your business , my lady , "
976760	976831	976756	976758	the Resurrection Man	3220	" The fact is , I find this place so much to my liking , and it answers my views as well as my safety so well , that I am in no hurry to quit it . You may look as black as you please : but you ought to know by this time that Tony Tidkins is not the man to be frightened by a lady 's frown . "
976832	976839	976841	976841	Adeline	1545	" The law will protect me , "
976851	976859	976861	976863	the Resurrection Man	952	" Yes — and punish you too , "
976867	976873	976875	976876	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" Now listen to me , "
976883	976948	976875	976876	Lady Ravensworth	1680	" human forbearance has limits — human patience has bounds . My forbearance is exhausted — my patience is worn out . Sooner than submit to your persecutions — sooner than be at the mercy of your extortions,—I will seek redress at the hands of justice — aye , even though I draw down its vengeance upon my own head at the same time ! "
977002	977027	976994	976994	he	3220	" If you attempt that dodge again , I 'll shoot you through the head as sure as you 're now a living woman . "
977039	977056	977063	977063	he	3220	" You see that it 's no use to play tricks with me , young lady , "
977071	977079	977081	977081	Adeline	1545	" What is it that you require ? "
977090	977199	977081	977081	Adeline	1545	" what can I do to induce you to depart and never molest me more ? Oh ! have mercy upon me , I implore you — have mercy upon me ! I have no friends to protect me : I am widowed and childless . My poor boy has been snatched from me — my sole earthly solace is gone ! But why do you persecute me thus ? Have I ever injured you ? If you hate me — if you look upon me as an enemy , kill me outright:—do not — do not take my life by inches . Your presence is slow torture ! "
977200	977207	977209	977209	Tidkins	1061	" Will you listen to reason ? "
977211	977221	977209	977209	Tidkins	1061	" can you speak calmly for a few minutes ? "
977222	977229	977231	977231	Adeline	1545	" I will — I can , "
977244	977265	977266	977266	he	3220	" Well , then — if you keep your word , our business will soon be brought to an end , "
977279	977298	977266	977266	he	3220	" You must know that I 've been living in this house almost ever since you left it . "
977299	977303	977305	977305	Adeline	1545	" Living here ! "
977316	977330	977332	977332	Tidkins	1061	" Yes — living here as snug as a bug in a rug , "
977347	977393	977337	977337	he	1061	" The truth is I had certain reasons of my own for being either in or near London : and I looked about for a safe place . Happening to pass this way a few weeks after that business about Vernon , you know — — "
977394	977399	977401	977401	Adeline	1545	" Proceed — proceed ! "
977405	977412	977414	977414	Tidkins	1061	" I 'm in no hurry , "
977416	977436	977414	977414	Tidkins	1061	" But my servant may come — Quentin will be here shortly — I expect him every minute — — "
977437	977447	977449	977449	Tidkins	1061	" He wo n't hurt me , my lady , "
977453	977731	977449	977449	Tidkins	1061	" If he attempted to lay a hand on me , I 'd shoot him on the spot . However , I will go on quicker — since you wish it . Well , as I was saying , I passed by this way and saw the house all shut up . Inquiries at the village down yonder let me know that you was gone , and that there was no one but an old man and his wife about the premises . Nothing could suit me better : I resolved to take up my quarters here directly;—and I pitched upon the very room where Vernon threw himself out of the window . One day I heard the two old people talking in the next apartment , which they were dusting out ; and I found , by their discourse , that they believed in ghosts . That was a glorious discovery for me : I soon saw that certain little devices which I practised made them think that Vernon 's spirit haunted the place — and so I boldly opened the shutters and made myself comfortable , when I took it into my head . They were n't at the house , it seems , when I was staying here two years ago ; and so they did n't know who I really was . Thus , when they saw me standing in the balcony — which I often did just to amuse myself by frightening them a little — they firmly believed it was Gilbert Vernon 's spirit that haunted the place . Lord ! how I have laughed sometimes at the poor old souls ! "
977732	977739	977741	977741	Adeline	1545	" It is you , then , "
977749	977760	977778	977778	Tidkins	1061	" who have been plundering the Hall during my absence ? "
977761	977776	977778	977778	Tidkins	1061	" Well — you may call it by that name , if you like , "
977786	977865	977778	977778	Tidkins	1061	" I do n't hesitate to admit that I have now and then walked off with a small picture — or a time - piece — or a mantel ornament — or what not — just to raise supplies for the time being . But you ought to be very much obliged to me that I 've left any thing at all in the whole place . Such forbearance is n't quite in keeping with my usual disposition . "
977866	977878	977886	977886	her	1680	" Villain ! this to me — and said so coolly ! "
977889	977898	977900	977900	Tidkins	1061	" Pray keep where you are , ma'am , "
977910	977918	977900	977900	Tidkins	1061	" you promised to listen to reason . "
977919	977922	977924	977924	Adeline	1545	" Reason ! "
977926	977954	977924	977924	Adeline	1545	" and do you call it reason when I am compelled to hear the narrative of your villanies — the history of your depredations on my property ? "
977955	977967	977969	977971	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You knew what I was when you sought my acquaintance , "
977973	977995	977969	977971	the Resurrection Man	3220	" and after all , I 've only just been taking the little liberties which one friend may use with another . "
977996	977999	978001	978001	Adeline	1545	" Friend ! "
978023	978035	978037	978039	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Come — we're only wasting time by all this disputing , "
978041	978126	978037	978039	the Resurrection Man	3220	" The whole thing lies in a nut - shell . You 've come home again — and you want to enjoy undisputed possession of your own house . Well — that is reasonable enough . But , by so doing , you turn me out of doors ; and I do n't exactly know where I shall find a crib so safe and convenient as this . I must have an indemnity , then : and that is also reasonable on my part . "
978127	978139	978141	978141	Adeline	1545	" Until you told me that you had robbed the house , "
978160	978222	978037	978039	the Resurrection Man	3220	time,—"I was prepared to purchase your departure with a sum of money : but now,—now that I have the most convincing proofs of your utter profligacy — even if such proofs were wanting,—now that I see the folly of reposing the slightest trust in one who studies nothing save his own wants and interests,—I will think of a compromise no longer . "
978223	978230	978232	978232	Tidkins	1061	" You will repent your obstinacy , "
978234	978254	978232	978232	Tidkins	1061	" Remember how you have dared me on a former occasion , and how I reduced you to submission . "
978255	978258	978260	978260	Adeline	1545	" True ! "
978279	978402	978407	978407	she	1545	" but at that time I was crushed by the weight of difficulties — overwhelmed with embarrassments and perils of the most formidable nature . I would then have committed any new crime to screen the former ones : I would have effected any compromise in order to avert danger . But now — what is there to bind me to existence ? Nothing — unless it be the enjoyment of seclusion and tranquillity . These are menaced by your persecutions : and I will put an end to this intolerable tyranny — or perish in the attempt . That is my decision . Let us be at open war , if you will : and ' tis thus I commence hostilities ! "
978469	978505	978457	978457	he	1061	" This is the last time I will be trifled with . By Satan ! young woman , I 'll strangle you , if this game continues — just as I strangled your Lydia Hutchinson ! "
978593	978602	978603	978603	he	3220	" Let us make a long business short , "
978613	978679	978603	978603	he	3220	" If I told you just now that I had helped myself to a few of the things in this house , it was only to convince you that I am not likely to stick at trifles in respect to you or yours . You have money — and I want some . Give me my price — and you shall never see me again . "
978680	978691	978693	978693	Adeline	1545	" No — you may murder me if you will , "
978697	978732	978693	978693	Adeline	1545	" but I will not submit to your tyranny any more . Oh ! you are a terrible man — and I would sooner die than live in the constant terror of your persecution ! "
978733	978761	978763	978763	Tidkins	1061	" Foolish woman , give up this screeching — or , by hell ! I 'll settle you , and then help myself to all I want , "
978862	978874	978875	978875	he	3220	" I must put an end to this nonsense at once , "
978883	978950	978875	978875	he	3220	" There is something now in the house , proud and obstinate woman as you are — that will make you fall on your knees and beseech me to remove it from your sight . But we will try that test : and remember , this pistol that touches your forehead is loaded . Attempt to raise an alarm — and I blow your brains out . "
978951	978963	978965	978965	Adeline	1545	" Release me — let me go — I implore you ! "
978991	978998	979000	979000	Tidkins	1061	" No — you shall come , "
979004	979022	979000	979000	Tidkins	1061	" I am sick of this reasoning , and must bring you to the point at once . "
979023	979040	979042	979042	Adeline	1545	" Let me go — and I swear to follow whither you may choose to lead , "
979044	979055	979042	979042	Adeline	1545	" Well — now I release you on that condition , "
979247	979258	979259	979259	she	1545	" Oh ! no — not here ! not here ! "
979290	979307	979309	979309	Tidkins	1061	" Then give me a thousand pounds — and I will leave the house this minute , "
979311	979320	979322	979322	Adeline	1545	" No — you shall kill me first ! "
979345	979361	979334	979334	she	1545	" I will resist you to the death : you have driven me to desperation ! "
979491	979501	979482	979482	he	3220	" Behold the remains of the murdered Lydia Hutchinson ! "
979555	979564	979566	979568	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Perdition ! I have gone too far , "
979570	979587	979566	979568	the Resurrection Man	3220	" She is dead — and I have done as good as cut my own throat ! "
980065	980072	980048	980048	They	26726	" sleep off his melancholy humour , "
980136	980147	980149	980150	the Major	42047	" At length I find you alone , Mr. Egerton , "
980152	980180	980149	980150	the Major	42047	" I have called every evening for the last few days , and have never until now been fortunate enough to learn that you were at home . "
980181	980194	980196	980202	the young man , whom it struck	25763	" To what am I to attribute the honour of this visit ? "
980220	980244	980246	980246	Anderson	1836	" Pardon me if , ere I reply to that question , I pause to observe that you survey me with some attention , "
980248	980323	980246	980246	Anderson	1836	" and I can divine what is passing in your mind . You think that my features are not altogether unknown to you ? I believe this to be the case — for you have seen me before . Indeed I should have begun by thanking you — most gratefully thanking you for that generous intention on your part which was interrupted at the door of the St. James 's Club - House — — "
980324	980330	980332	980332	Egerton	1818	" Ah ! I recollect ! "
980341	980345	980332	980332	Egerton	1818	" But — — "
980346	980358	980360	980361	the Major	42047	" Again I can read what is passing in your mind , "
980367	980448	980360	980361	the Major	42047	" and I can appreciate the delicacy which made you thus stop short . You notice the change that has taken place in my appearance ? Yes — my circumstances are indeed altered ; and from a wandering mendicant , I have become a gentleman once more . But that change has been effected by the very individual whose interposition on that night to which I have just now alluded , prevented you from exercising your intended benevolence towards me . "
980449	980459	980461	980461	Egerton	1818	" And that individual was the Prince of Montoni , "
980463	980474	980461	980461	Egerton	1818	" Oh ! then you know him by sight — — "
980475	980490	980492	980492	Egerton	1818	" I knew him not , otherwise than by name , until that evening , "
980494	980513	980492	980492	Egerton	1818	" and it was from Sir Rupert Harborough and Mr. Chichester that I learnt who the stranger was . "
980514	980527	980529	980529	Anderson	1836	" Ah ! his Highness has good cause to remember them also ! "
980546	980549	980551	980551	Egerton	1818	" Indeed , "
980553	980572	980551	980551	Egerton	1818	" I now recollect that they seemed alarmed at his presence , and mentioned his name with trepidation . "
980573	980580	980582	980583	the Major	42047	" Well might they do so ! "
980587	980603	980582	980583	the Major	42047	" But the Prince himself will explain to you those particulars to which I allude . "
980604	980612	980614	980614	Egerton	1818	" The Prince — explain to me ! "
980616	980654	980614	980614	Egerton	1818	" Yes : my object in calling upon you is to request that you will either visit the Prince as soon as convenient , or appoint a day and an hour when his Highness may visit you . "
980655	980679	980681	980681	Egerton	1818	" Oh ! I should be indeed joyful to form the acquaintance of that illustrious hero of whom every Englishman must feel proud ! "
980692	980727	980614	980614	Egerton	1818	" Valour , integrity , and the most unbounded humanity are associated with the name of Richard Markham . But upon what business can the Prince be desirous to honour me with his acquaintance ? "
980728	980736	980614	980614	Egerton	1818	" That his Highness will himself explain , "
980741	980761	980614	980614	Egerton	1818	" What hour will you appoint for to - morrow to wait upon the Prince at his own residence ? "
980762	980773	980775	980775	Egerton	1818	" I will be there punctually at mid - day , "
980777	980783	980785	980786	Major Anderson	1836	" And in the meantime , "
980794	980821	980785	980786	Major Anderson	1836	" it will be as well if you do not mention to those persons with whom you are intimate , the appointment which you have made . "
980822	980829	980831	980831	Egerton	1818	" I understand you , sir , "
980833	980841	980831	980831	Egerton	1818	" it shall be as you suggest . "
981033	981046	981051	981051	he	42047	" And there likewise is entombed the mystery of the dead body ! "
981107	981126	981128	981128	Richard	874	" You will perhaps imagine that I have taken a very great liberty with you , Mr. Egerton , "
981130	981195	981128	981128	Richard	874	" in requesting you to call upon me in this manner ; but when you are made acquainted with my motives in seeking the present interview , you will give me credit for the most sincere disinterestedness . In a word , I consider it to be my duty to warn you against at least two of those persons who call themselves your friends . "
981196	981209	981211	981211	Egerton	1818	" My lord , I was not unprepared for such an announcement , "
981218	981227	981229	981229	Richard	874	" Then is my task the more easy , "
981231	981252	981229	981229	Richard	874	" I allude to Sir Rupert Harborough and Mr. Chichester , the latter of whom assumes the distinction of Honourable . "
981253	981265	981267	981267	Egerton	1818	" And is he not of noble birth , my lord ? "
981269	981278	981280	981280	Markham	874	" He is the son of a tradesman , "
981282	981348	981349	981349	Egerton	1818	" But that is no disgrace in my estimation : far from it ! The industrious classes are the pillars of England 's greatness ; and I for one would rather walk arm - in - arm along the most fashionable thoroughfare with the honest mechanic or upright shopkeeper , than boast of intimacy even with a King who is unworthy of esteem and respect . "
981393	981396	981398	981398	Markham	874	" Yes , "
981400	981525	981398	981398	Markham	874	" your friend Mr. Chichester is one of those impostors who assume title and distinction as well to aid their nefarious courses as to gratify their own grovelling pride . I do not speak with malignity of that man — although I once suffered so much through him : for were he to seek my forgiveness , heaven knows how readily it would be accorded . Neither is it to gratify any mean sentiment of revenge that I now warn you against these two individuals . My present conduct is dictated by a sense of duty , and by an ardent desire to save a young and confiding young man , as I believe you to be , from the snares of unprincipled adventurers . "
981526	981537	981539	981539	Egerton	1818	" Oh ! now a light breaks in upon me , "
981541	981576	981539	981539	Egerton	1818	" and I recognise in the actions of those whom I lately deemed my friends , all the designing intrigues to which your Highness alludes ! Fool that I was to be thus deceived ! "
981577	981594	981596	981597	the Prince	6244	" Rather thank heaven that the means of redemption have arrived ere it be too late , "
981601	981631	981596	981597	the Prince	6244	" for I can scarcely believe , from all I have heard concerning you , that your affairs are in a state of ruin which admits of no hope . "
981632	981638	981640	981640	Egerton	1818	" Your Highness argues truly , "
981642	981660	981640	981640	Egerton	1818	" I have yet sufficient resources remaining to furnish me with the means of an honourable livelihood . "
981661	981678	981680	981681	the Prince	6244	" Then you need scarcely regret the amount you have paid for the purchase of experience , "
981683	981790	981680	981681	the Prince	6244	" But allow me to place in your hands proofs of the iniquity of Sir Rupert Harborough and his friend . Behold these two documents ! They contain the narrative of as foul a scheme of turpitude as ever called the misdirected vengeance of the law upon an innocent victim . The first of these papers is the confession of an engraver whom Harborough and Chichester made the instrument of that project which at one time covered my name with so dark a cloud . You seem astonished at what I say ? Oh ! then you are ignorant of that episode in my chequered life . "
981791	981811	981813	981813	Egerton	1818	" Never have I heard rumour busy with your lordship 's name , save to its honour and glory , "
981822	981835	981837	981838	our hero	5194	" Peruse these papers — they will not occupy you many minutes , "
981845	981879	981837	981838	our hero	5194	" The second document , which I now hand you , only came into my possession this morning : it was signed yesterday afternoon , by Sir Rupert Harborough and Mr. Chichester — — "
981880	981887	981889	981889	Egerton	1818	" Yesterday afternoon , my lord ! "
981891	981907	981889	981889	Egerton	1818	" Those gentlemen were in my company — at a short distance from London — — "
981908	981913	981915	981915	Richard	874	" At Ravensworth Park , "
981921	982096	981915	981915	Richard	874	" You see that I know all . It was indeed at that very mansion — which , as you are doubtless aware , was reduced to ashes during the night — that this confession was drawn up and signed by your two friends . The engraver , whose name is appended to the first of those papers , was led by accident to Ravensworth Hall ; and there he encountered the two adventurers who had once made him their instrument — their vile tool ! He compelled them to draw up and sign that second paper , which you hold in your hands , and which , through gratitude for some trifling act of kindness that I was once enabled to show him , he obtained by working on their fears . Scarcely an hour has elapsed since I experienced the satisfaction of receiving that document from him ; and my delight was enhanced by the conviction that he is now an honest — a worthy — and a prosperous member of society . "
982267	982280	982282	982283	the Prince	6244	" Would you rush madly into a thicket where venomous reptiles abound ? "
982285	982437	982282	982283	the Prince	6244	" would you plunge of your own accord into a forest where the most terrible wild beasts are prowling ? would you , without a sufficient motive , leave the wholesome country and take up your abode in a plague - stricken city ? No : and it would be an insult to your understanding — to that intelligence with which God has endowed you — to put such questions to you , were it not for the purpose of conveying a more impressive moral . For the gaming - house is the thicket where reptiles abound — it is the forest where wild beasts prowl , ravenous after their prey — it is the city of pestilence into which one hurries from the salubrious air . Pause , then — reflect , my young friend,—and say whether the folly of the gambler be not even as great as his wickedness ? "
982467	982481	982483	982485	the young man	2266	" You have converted me , my lord — you have saved me ! "
982502	982539	982483	982485	the young man	2266	" Oh ! how can I express my gratitude ? But you may read it in those tears which I now shed — tears of contrition for the past , and bright hopes for the future ! "
982551	982596	982540	982540	Richard	874	" Enough ! I see that you are sincere . And now listen to the plan which I have conceived to shame the men who have been preying upon you ; for such punishment is their due — and it may even be salutary . "
982978	982995	982997	982997	Dunstable	1539	" Well , I really began to suppose that you had determined to cut us altogether , "
983006	983018	982997	982997	Dunstable	1539	" For three whole days we saw nothing of you — — "
983019	983049	983051	983051	Egerton	1818	" Have I not already assured you that I was compelled to pass that time with my relatives , in order to appease them after the exposure at Ravensworth ? "
983053	983065	983067	983067	Chichester	886	" And we have accepted the apology as a valid one , "
983069	983074	983076	983077	the baronet	26709	" Upon my honour , "
983079	983113	983076	983077	the baronet	26709	" if I had known you were doing the amiable on Finsbury Pavement , I should have called just to help you in your endeavours to regain the favour of those excellent ladies . "
983114	983130	983132	983133	Colonel Cholmondeley	1541	" I am afraid your reception would have been none of the best , Harborough , "
983135	983147	983149	983149	Egerton	1818	" I must confess that the old lady was terribly enraged , "
983151	983175	983149	983149	Egerton	1818	" not only against me , but also against you all , as she looked upon you as my accomplices in the cheat . "
983176	983192	983194	983195	Lord Dunstable	1539	" Well , we must take some opportunity of making our peace in that quarter , "
983197	983231	983194	983195	Lord Dunstable	1539	" I will send her a dozen of champagne and a Strasburg pie to - morrow , with my compliments . But what shall we do to pass away an hour or two ? "
983232	983238	983240	983240	Chichester	886	" What shall we do ? "
983242	983261	983240	983240	Chichester	886	" Why , amuse ourselves — as gentlemen of rank and fashion are accustomed — eh , Egerton ? "
983262	983283	983284	983284	he	1539	" Oh ! decidedly . I am willing to fall in with your views . You have been my tutor , "
983292	983301	983284	983284	he	1539	" and the pupil will not prove rebellious . "
983302	983309	983311	983311	Dunstable	1539	" Well said , my boy ! "
983313	983322	983311	983311	Dunstable	1539	" Have you your dice - box handy ? "
983323	983333	983335	983335	Egerton	1818	" My rascal of a tiger has lost it , "
983337	983352	983335	983335	Egerton	1818	" But I know that the baronet seldom goes abroad without the usual implements . "
983353	983359	983361	983362	Sir Rupert	887	" Ah ! you dog ! "
983372	983418	983441	983441	Dunstable	1539	" You are , however , quite right ; and I do not think that any fashionable man about town should forget to provide himself with the means of the most aristocratic of all innocent recreations . Upon my honour , that is my opinion . "
983419	983439	983441	983441	Dunstable	1539	" Just what my friend the Duke of Highgate said the other day — even to the very words , "
983443	983447	983449	983450	the baronet	26709	" How singular ! "
983463	983470	983472	983472	Egerton	1818	" By the by , Dunstable , "
983474	983484	983472	983472	Egerton	1818	" you promised to introduce me to his Grace . "
983485	983526	983441	983441	Dunstable	1539	" So I did , my dear boy — and so I will . Let me see — I shall see the Duke on Monday , and I will make an appointment for him to join us at dinner somewhere . "
983527	983532	983534	983534	Egerton	1818	" The very thing , "
983536	983554	983534	983534	Egerton	1818	" I shall be quite delighted — particularly if his Grace be one of your own sort . "
983555	983565	983567	983567	Dunstable	1539	" Oh ! he is — to the utmost , "
983584	983591	983593	983595	the young man	2266	" I am glad of that , "
983597	983643	983593	983595	the young man	2266	" If I only knew three or four more such gay , dashing , good - hearted fellows as you all are , I should be as contented as possible . By the way , Chichester , I will tell you a very odd thing . "
983644	983651	983653	983654	that gentleman	3618	" Indeed ! what is it ? "
983656	983727	983653	983654	that gentleman	3618	" Oh ! nothing more than a strange coincidence . Just this:—I told you that I had been staying a day or two with my respected aunt on the Pavement . Well , yesterday I wandered through the Tower Hamlets — merely for a ramble — and without any fixed purpose : but , as I was strolling down Brick Lane — a horrid , low , vulgar neighbourhood — — "
983728	983731	983733	983733	Chichester	886	" Dreadful ! "
983742	983751	983753	983753	Egerton	1818	" Oh ! terrible — filthy , degrading , "
983757	983793	983753	983753	Egerton	1818	" You may therefore conceive my surprise when I perceived the aristocratic name of Chichester painted in huge yellow letters , shaded with brown , over a shop - front in that same Brick Lane . "
983794	983799	983801	983801	Chichester	886	" How very odd ! "
983810	983821	983823	983824	the baronet	26709	" Yes — but those coincidences of course do occur , "
983851	983860	983862	983864	the young man	2266	" And what made the thing more ludicrous , "
983866	983881	983862	983864	the young man	2266	" was that over the aristocratic name of Chichester hung three dingy yellow balls . "
983882	983887	983889	983896	the gentleman whom this announcement so particularly touched	25829	" Capital ! excellent ! "
983908	983920	983922	983922	Egerton	1818	" Yes : I had a good laugh at the coincidence , "
983924	983960	983922	983922	Egerton	1818	" At the same time I knew very well that there could be nothing in common between Mr. Chichester , the pawnbroker of Brick Lane , and the Honourable Arthur Chichester of the fashionable world . "
983961	983969	983971	983971	Chichester	886	" I should hope not , indeed ! "
983978	983987	983989	983991	Sir Rupert Harborough	887	" Come — take the box , Egerton , "
983993	983998	984000	984002	the young man	2266	" Oh ! willingly , "
984004	984034	984000	984002	the young man	2266	" But we must play on credit , because I have no money in the house ; and he who loses shall pay by cheque or note of hand . "
984035	984039	984041	984042	the baronet	26709	" With pleasure , "
984086	984134	984056	984056	He	2266	" Seven 's the main . Come , Dunstable , fill your glass : the wine stands with you . By the by , has your rascally steward sent you up your remittances yet ? You know you were complaining to me about him the other day . "
984135	984144	984146	984148	the young nobleman	42059	" No — he is still a defaulter , "
984152	984163	984165	984165	Egerton	1818	" And likely to continue so , I 'm afraid , "
984167	984179	984165	984165	Egerton	1818	" But where is that estate of yours , old fellow ? "
984180	984189	984056	984056	He	2266	" Oh ! down in the country — — "
984190	984202	984056	984056	He	2266	" Yes — I dare say it is . But where ? "
984203	984219	984221	984221	Dunstable	1539	" Why — in Somersetshire , to be sure . I thought you knew that , "
984239	984250	984252	984252	Egerton	1818	" That makes seven hundred I owe you , Harborough , "
984254	984308	984252	984252	Egerton	1818	" Do pass the wine , Chichester . Five 's the main . Let me see — what were we talking about ? Oh ! I recollect — Dunstable 's estate . And so it 's in Somersetshire ? Beautiful county ! What is the name of the estate , my dear fellow ? "
984309	984317	984323	984324	the nobleman	3005	" My own name — Dunstable Manor , "
984334	984346	984348	984348	Egerton	1818	" Dunstable Manor — eh ? What a sweet pretty name ! "
984350	984392	984397	984397	he	2330	" And yet it is very strange — I know Somersetshire as well as any one can know a county ; but I do not recollect Dunstable Manor . How foolish I must be to forget such a thing as that . "
984414	984422	984424	984424	Dunstable	1539	" What are you going to do ? "
984431	984443	984445	984445	Egerton	1818	" Only refreshing my memory by a reference to this Gazetteer , "
984458	984468	984470	984470	Dunstable	1539	" Oh ! come — none of this nonsense ! "
984480	984489	984470	984470	Dunstable	1539	" Who ever thinks of reading before company ? "
984490	984499	984501	984501	Egerton	1818	" It would be rude , I admit , "
984512	984558	984501	984501	Egerton	1818	" were we not such very particular and intimate friends — so intimate indeed , that we have one purse in common between us all five , and that purse happens to be the one which I have the honour to carry in my pocket . "
984559	984569	984571	984572	Lord Dunstable	1539	" Egerton , what is the matter with you ? "
984583	984594	984596	984598	the young man	2266	" Matter ! nothing at all , my dear boy , "
984611	984643	984601	984601	he	2266	" Here it is — Somersetshire — a very detailed account — not even the smallest farm omitted . But how is this ? Why — Dunstable Manor is not here ! "
984644	984648	984650	984651	the nobleman	3005	" Not there ! "
984660	984668	984670	984670	Egerton	1818	" No — indeed it is not ! "
984672	984753	984670	984670	Egerton	1818	" Now really this is a great piece of negligence on the part of the compiler of the work ; and if I were you , Dunstable , I would bring an action against him for damages . Because , only conceive how awkward this would make you appear before persons of suspicious dispositions . Well — upon my honour , as the baronet says — this coincidence is almost as extraordinary as that of the pawnbroker in Brick Lane . "
984779	984802	984804	984804	Egerton	1818	" Yes — suspicious people would be inclined to imagine that the Dunstable estate was in the clouds rather than in Somersetshire , "
984818	984869	984804	984804	Egerton	1818	" But the world is so very ill - natured ! Would you believe that there are persons so lamentably scandalous as to declare that our friend Chichester is no more an Honourable than I am , and that he really is the son of the pawnbroker in Brick Lane ? "
984870	984874	984876	984876	Chichester	886	" The villains ! "
984883	984892	984876	984876	Chichester	886	" who are those persons that dare — — "
984893	984898	984900	984900	Egerton	1818	" Wait one moment ! "
984902	984955	984900	984900	Egerton	1818	" it is my duty as a sincere friend to tell you each and all what I have heard . Those same scandalous and ill - natured people exceed all bounds of propriety ; for they actually assert that Sir Rupert Harborough has for years been known as a profligate adventurer — — "
984956	984963	984965	984966	the baronet	26709	" By God , Mr. Egerton ! "
984968	984972	984965	984966	the baronet	26709	" I — — "
984973	984984	984986	984988	the young man	2266	" And they affirm in quite as positive a manner , "
984995	985016	984986	984988	the young man	2266	" that you , Dunstable , and you too , Cholmondeley , are nothing more nor less than ruined gamesters . "
985017	985020	985022	985023	the Colonel	30185	" Egerton , "
985029	985038	985022	985023	the Colonel	30185	" this is carrying a joke too far . "
985039	985046	985048	985048	Dunstable	1539	" A great deal too far , "
985050	985064	985066	985068	the young man	2266	" It really is no joke at all , my lord and gentlemen , "
985081	985094	985066	985068	the young man	2266	" for every word I have uttered is firmly believed by myself ! "
985095	985099	985101	985103	the four adventurers	25847	" By you ! "
985113	985122	985124	985124	Egerton	1818	" Yes — and by all the world , "
985139	985145	985157	985157	he	1541	" This is too much ! "
985236	985242	985247	985247	he	887	" The Prince of Montoni ! "
985280	985296	985277	985277	he	6244	" No one passes hence , at present . Mr. Egerton , secure those dice . "
985335	985341	985343	985343	Cholmondeley	1541	" Be he a king , "
985355	985363	985364	985365	the Colonel	30185	" he shall suffer for his conduct to me;"—and
985375	985388	985390	985390	Richard	874	" Beware , sir , how you place a finger on me ! "
985392	985407	985390	985390	Richard	874	" Approach another step nearer , and I will lay you at my feet ! "
985455	985463	985465	985466	the Prince	6244	" Let no one pass , Whittingham , "
985468	985476	985465	985466	the Prince	6244	" until our present business be accomplished . "
985477	985483	985485	985487	the old butler	26551	" No , my lord , "
985521	985544	985514	985514	Whittingham	881	" And mind , my men , that you on no account let them sneaking willains Scarborough and Axminster defect their escape ! "
985545	985557	985559	985559	Dunstable	1539	" My lord , what means this conduct on your part ? "
985564	985576	985514	985514	Whittingham	881	" By what authority do you detain us here as prisoners ? "
985577	985584	985586	985586	Cholmondeley	1541	" Yes — by what authority ? "
985592	985618	985620	985620	Richard	874	" By that authority which gives every honest man a right to expose unprincipled adventurers who are leagued to plunder and rob an inexperienced youth , "
985627	985636	985620	985620	Richard	874	" Mr. Egerton , give me those dice . "
985732	985738	985740	985741	the Prince	6244	" Behold , Mr. Egerton , "
985754	985798	985740	985741	the Prince	6244	" how your false friends have been enabled to plunder you . Heaven be thanked that I am entirely ignorant of the disgraceful details of gamesters ' frauds ; but a child might understand for what purpose this die has been thus prepared . "
985799	985813	985814	985816	That scoundrel there	25874	" Loaded , your Highness , is the technical term , observed Pocock . "
985818	985823	985814	985816	That scoundrel there	25874	" pointing to Chichester , "
985845	985846	985814	985816	That scoundrel there	25874	" "
985858	985873	985874	985874	Egerton	1818	" said Lord Dunstable , his manner having changed to the most cringing meekness . "
985885	985886	985888	985888	you	1818	" "
985894	985902	985888	985888	you	1818	" inquired the young man , bitterly . "
985929	985941	985943	985943	'em	25878	" ejaculated the old butler , rubbing his hands joyfully together . "
985969	985970	985966	985967	my lord	27330	" "
985986	985999	985984	985984	mother	3159	" said Dunstable , whose entire manner expressed the most profound alarm . "
986011	986012	985984	985984	mother	3159	" "
986024	986033	986022	986022	yourself	0	" interrupted Markham , in a severe tone . "
986081	986082	986073	986073	I	0	" "
986093	986105	986090	986091	your Highness	36939	" observed Egerton , with a grateful glance towards the Prince . "
986120	986124	986125	986125	we	25888	" exclaimed Richard : "
986226	986227	986228	986228	Your	25894	" "
986237	986242	986228	986229	Your Highness	36939	" said Lord Dunstable ; "
986317	986357	986358	986359	Lord Dunstable	1539	" The young nobleman spoke with a feeling and an evident sincerity that touched both our hero and Egerton ; but Cholmondeley turned away in disgust from his penitent friend , and Harborough exchanged a contemptuous look with Chichester . "
986361	986370	986358	986359	Lord Dunstable	1539	" said Markham , in an impressive tone , "
986445	986446	986436	986436	their	25897	" "
986452	986464	986436	986436	their	25897	" returned the young nobleman , tears trickling down his cheeks : "
986526	986556	986557	986558	My lord	27330	" With these words , Dunstable bowed profoundly to the Prince , and hurried from the room , without casting a single glance upon his late confederates in iniquity . "
986577	986593	986557	986558	My lord	27330	" asked the old butler , as soon as Dunstable had disappeared from the room . "
986607	986617	986557	986558	My lord	27330	" said the Prince , turning towards the engraver , "
986767	986834	986842	986842	they	25904	" Having uttered these words , the Prince turned away , with undisguised aversion , from the two villains whom he had so impressively and solemnly addressed . They slunk out of the apartment , with chap - fallen countenances , while Whittingham followed them to the door of the dining - room , through which they passed , and conveyed to them the satisfactory intelligence that "
986858	986905	986842	986842	they	25904	" As soon as they had departed , Colonel Cholmondeley inquired in an insolent tone whether the Prince had any thing to say to him ; but finding that Markham turned his back contemptuously upon him , he swaggered out of the room , muttering something about "
986911	986925	986842	986842	they	25904	" Early the next morning , Mrs. Bustard received the following letter : — "
986932	987100	987101	987101	I	0	" Faithful to the promise which I made to you the day before yesterday , my dear aunt , I have quitted the West End , and am once more located in a quiet neighbourhood . Thanks to the kind interference of that most amiable and excellent nobleman the Prince of Montoni , and to the encouragement given me by your forgiveness of the deception which I so shamefully practised upon you , I have been completely awakened to the errors of my late mode of life . I shall pledge myself to nothing now : my future conduct will prove to you how effectually wise counsels and past experience have changed my habits , my inclinations , and my ideas . One thing , however , I may state on the present occasion : namely , that I am convinced there is no character so truly dangerous and so thoroughly unprincipled as the one who delights in the name of ' the man about town . ' "
987271	987404	987405	987405	Your	25915	" To the Prince my unbounded gratitude is due . He has saved me from utter ruin , and has advised me how to employ the remainder of my fortune so as to recover by my industry what I have lost by my folly . It appears that his august father - in - law , the sovereign of Castelcicala,—and who has set so good an example to the Italian States by giving a Constitution and a national representation to his own country,—has established a line of steam - packets between London and Montoni ; and it is my intention to trade between the two capitals . But the details of this project I will explain to you to - morrow , when I shall have the pleasure of calling upon you . "
987412	987901	987405	987405	Your	25915	" It was about a week after the exposure which had taken place in Stratton Street , that the following events occurred at the splendid mansion of the Marquis of Holmesford . Although the time - piece upon the mantel of this nobleman 's bed - room had only just proclaimed the hour of three in the afternoon , yet the curtains were drawn close over the windows , and the chamber was rendered as dark as possible . In that apartment , too , there was a profound silence — broken only by the low but irregular breathing of some one who slept in the bed . By the side of the couch sate two elderly men , dressed in black , and who maintained a strict taciturnity — doubtless for fear of awakening the sleeper . On a small table between them were various bottles containing medicines . The bed stood upon a sort of dais , or raised portion of the floor , this platform being attained by two steps . High over the couch was a canopy of velvet and gold , surmounted by the coronet of a Marquis , and from whence the rich satin curtains , of dark purple , flowed over that voluptuous bed . The room itself was furnished in the most luxurious manner . The rosewood tables were inlaid with mother of pearl : the chairs were of antique form , with high backs carved in the most exquisite manner;—the mirrors were large , the pictures numerous , and all set in magnificent frames;—and the toilette - table was of the most elegant and costly description . And yet he , for whom all this gorgeousness and splendour had been devised,—he , whose wealth had converted the entire mansion into a palace that would have even delighted the proudest Sultan that ever sate on an oriental throne,—this man , for whom earth had such delights — the world so many enjoyments,—this man — the Marquis of Holmesford — was about to succumb to the power of the Angel of Death . Oh ! what a mockery was it to behold,—when the window - curtains were drawn back , upon the Marquis awaking from his uneasy slumber,—what a mockery was it to behold that truly imperial magnificence surrounding the couch whereon lay a thin , weak , haggard , and attenuated old man , in whose eyes was already seen that stony glare which marks the last looks of dissolving nature ! The nobleman awoke , and turned round towards his physicians , who watched at the bed - side . One of them rose and drew back the window - curtains as noiselessly as possible ; and then the pure light of a lovely day streamed into the apartment . The other medical attendant took the nobleman 's hand , felt his pulse , and inquired in a low whisper "
987908	987909	987903	987904	his lordship	3013	" "
987921	987933	987903	987904	his lordship	3013	" answered the Marquis , in a hollow but feeble tone . "
987970	987984	987961	987961	men	1993	" he added , pronouncing the fatal word with a most painful effort , "
987991	987992	987993	987993	Your	0	" "
988005	988012	987993	987993	Your	0	" said the physician , emphatically ; "
988025	988026	988016	988016	my	0	" "
988037	988042	988030	988030	you	0	" stammered the Marquis , "
988055	988087	988088	988089	My lord	27330	" And as he spoke , his glassy eyes were for a few moments lighted up with the evanescent fire of intense excitement — the agitation of a suspense ineffably painful . "
988091	988101	988088	988089	My lord	27330	" answered the physician , in a solemn tone , "
988115	988116	988103	988103	you	0	" "
988131	988146	988148	988148	you	0	" almost shrieked the old nobleman , starting up wildly to a sitting posture : "
988179	988180	988181	988181	My	0	" "
988185	988196	988181	988181	My	0	" said the second physician , advancing towards the bed , "
988215	988216	988210	988210	he	10280	" "
988225	988236	988237	988237	you	0	" again interrupted the nobleman , catching at a straw : "
988321	988344	988311	988311	you	0	" And once more did he contemplate them with eager — anxious glances , expressive alike of feverish hope and tremendous terror . "
988349	988353	988311	988311	you	0	" he cried : "
988373	988374	988376	988377	your lordship	28358	" "
988385	988395	988376	988377	your lordship	28358	" answered the elder physician — he who had first spoken,—"we
988416	988417	988410	988410	you	0	" "
988423	988457	988468	988468	you	0	" ejaculated the Marquis , attempting a laugh — which , however , rather resembled a death - rattle that seemed to shake his crazy old frame even to the very vital foundations : "
988549	988614	988540	988540	doctor	25921	" And , thus speaking , the Marquis fell back upon his pillow , in a state of extreme exhaustion . The younger physician forced him to swallow some medicine ; and for a few minutes he lay panting and moaning as if the chords of existence were snapping rapidly one after the other . At length he turned again towards his medical attendants . "
988634	988646	988621	988621	I	0	" he said , in a very faint and feeble tone : "
988718	988719	988722	988722	my	0	" "
988730	988737	988728	988728	yourself	15515	" observed the elder medical attendant . "
988750	988751	988781	988781	you	15515	" "
988766	988771	988761	988761	I	0	" said the Marquis . "
988803	988829	988781	988781	you	15515	" he added , with a ghastly attempt to smile away that expression of profound terror which he felt to be imprinted on his countenance . "
988860	988861	988852	988852	you	15515	" "
988875	988887	988865	988865	you	15515	" said the elder physician , who was thus appealed to . "
988913	988914	988915	988915	Doctor	25921	" "
988925	988933	988917	988917	doctor	25921	" again half shrieked the affrighted nobleman . "
988984	988985	988976	988976	you	15515	" "
988989	988996	988976	988976	you	15515	" said the physician , solemnly , "
989014	989343	989344	989344	My	0	" The Marquis uttered a hollow groan , and , closing his eyes , appeared to be suddenly wrapt in profound meditation . The scene which we have just described , was a most painful one — even to those two physicians whose experience in such matters was so extensive . There was something peculiarly horrible in that old man of shattered health and exhausted vigour , boasting of the strength of a constitution ruined by a long career of debauchery,—boasting , too , even against his own internal convictions ! But , like all men who fear to die , the Marquis would not admit in words what his soul had acknowledged to itself . He seemed to feel as if there were a possibility of staving off the approach of death , merely by reiterating a disbelief that the destroyer was advancing at all . Thus , though his mind was filled with the most appalling apprehensions , he nevertheless clung — he knew not how nor wherefore — to a hope that his physicians might be deceived — that they had exaggerated his danger — that their skill was potent enough to wrestle with the dissolution of nature — in a word , that it was quite possible for him to recover . And , if he feared to die , it was not precisely because he dreaded the idea of being suddenly plunged into eternity ; for he had been a sceptic all his life , and was by no means convinced that there was any future state at all . But his mind shrank from the thought of death as from a revolting spectacle ; and moreover the world had so many charms — such boundless attractions for him — that he could not endure the prospect of being called away from those delicious scenes for ever ! He remained for nearly a quarter of an hour buried in the most profound meditation . "
989348	989367	989344	989344	My	0	" he at length said , opening his glassy eyes once more , and turning towards his physicians , "
989401	989402	989403	989404	Your lordship	28358	" "
989415	989421	989409	989413	a man of strong mind	25945	" answered the elder physician ; "
989443	989444	989437	989437	I	0	" "
989449	989456	989437	989437	I	0	" said the Marquis , hastily . "
989470	989477	989459	989459	your	0	" replied the physician , solemnly : "
989493	989494	989498	989498	your	0	" "
989502	989529	989498	989498	your	0	" said the Marquis , grasping the bed - clothes tightly with both his hands , as if to restrain an explosion of his agonising feelings . "
989543	989599	989533	989534	your lordship	28358	" returned the physician . A pause of some minutes ensued : the Marquis could not trust himself to speak . Silence was for a time the only safeguard against a relapse into those wildly - expressed doubts , adjurations , and frantic wanderings which had ere now denoted the real condition of his mind . "
989612	989625	989606	989606	I	0	" he at length said , in a low and measured tone . "
989651	989652	989638	989638	doctor	25921	" "
989666	989667	989638	989638	doctor	25921	" "
989682	989689	989671	989671	you	0	" interrupted the Marquis , angrily . "
989728	989754	989755	989755	Your	0	" The two physicians consulted each other with a rapid interchange of glances ; and both thereby intimating an affirmative , the elder one said , "
989767	989768	989755	989755	Your	0	" "
989776	989799	989755	989755	Your	0	" repeated the Marquis , the bed actually shaking with the cold shudder that passed through his frame at this appalling announcement : "
989807	989814	989825	989825	your	0	" he said a second time : "
989857	989858	989825	989825	your	0	" "
989872	989877	989825	989825	your	0	" was the reply . "
989881	989908	989869	989869	my	0	" murmured the Marquis : then after another short pause , he said in a tone which it cost him a dreadful effort to render firm , "
989924	990056	989869	989869	my	0	" This desire was immediately complied with ; and as the lawyer lived in the neighbourhood , scarcely half an hour elapsed ere he was ushered into the presence of the Marquis . The physicians were desired to remain in the room ; and the solicitor , seating himself by the nobleman 's directions at the table near the bed , prepared his writing materials . The Marquis of Holmesford then gave instructions relative to the disposal of his property ; and the lawyer drew up the will in due form . Having detailed various bequests and legacies , and disposed of the great bulk of his fortune , the Marquis , who spoke in a firm and distinct tone of voice , addressed the lawyer in the following manner : — "
990176	990177	990170	990170	you	26649	" "
990201	990208	990178	990178	I	0	" was the solicitor 's reply . "
990221	990294	990295	990297	My good friends	27348	" said the Marquis ; and he sate up in the bed , apparently with but little exertion . He affixed his name with a firm hand to the document , and requested the physicians to witness it . The ceremony was then completed ; and the solicitor took his departure . So soon as he had left the room , the Marquis addressed himself to the physicians in these terms : — "
990434	990435	990439	990439	your	0	" "
990453	990459	990460	990460	I	0	" said the elder physician , "
990496	990497	990498	990498	I	0	" "
990510	990540	990498	990498	I	0	" said the Marquis , his glazing eyes lighting up with the fever of impatience , and a hectic flush appearing on his sallow , sunken , withered cheeks . "
990578	990579	990580	990580	My	0	" "
990585	990586	990582	990582	Marquis	1519	" "
990594	990595	990587	990588	My lord	27330	" "
990609	990633	990587	990588	My lord	27330	" exclaimed the nobleman , cutting short the ejaculations of the two physicians by an imperious wave of his skeleton - like hand : "
990655	990765	990766	990766	You	25976	" The physicians essayed farther remonstrances — but in vain . The Marquis grew fearfully irritated with their opposition , and then fell back so exhausted upon his pillow , that the medical attendants were compelled to administer as a restorative the cordial which he had demanded as an artificial stimulant a few minutes previously . The effect of the cordial was really surprising : that old man , whom its influence had just snatched — but snatched only for a time — from the out - stretched arms of death , sate up in his bed , smiled , and seemed to bid defiance to the destroying angel . "
990775	990795	990766	990766	You	25976	" he said , in a jocose manner , which contrasted awfully with the inevitable peril of his condition : "
990828	990979	990980	990980	Gentlemen	27077	" The physicians , rather to please their obstinate patient than to gratify any avaricious longing on their part , did as they were desired : but , scarcely had they opened the desk , where they observed a bundle of Bank - notes , when a low chuckle met their ears . They turned and beheld the Marquis , clad in a long dressing - gown and with slippers on his feet , hurrying out of the room by a small door near the foot of his bed . To hasten after him was their first and most natural impulse ; but the key was turned on the other side ere they even reached the door . Without losing a moment , they hastened from the room by a door at the opposite extremity ; but in the adjoining passage they were met by the nobleman 's principal valet . "
990982	990987	990988	990988	his	25980	" said the domestic , "
991005	991006	990991	990991	me	0	" "
991013	991019	991009	991011	my good fellow	27449	" exclaimed the younger physician , "
991041	991042	991055	991055	Whither	884	" "
991047	991054	991055	991055	Whither	884	" added the senior medical attendant . "
991061	991087	991055	991055	Whither	884	" The valet whispered a few words to the physicians : they understood him full well , and exchanged looks of mingled disgust and horror . "
991095	991103	991055	991055	Whither	884	" at length observed the elder physician , "
991112	991143	991144	991145	the harem	25986	" We have described at great length , in a former portion of our narrative , the voluptuous attractions of that department of Holmesford House which may very properly be denominated "
991147	991646	991144	991145	the harem	25986	" The reader doubtless remembers the vast and lofty room which we depicted as being furnished in the most luxurious oriental style , and which was embellished with pictures representing licentious scenes from the mythology of the ancients . To that apartment we must now once more direct attention . Grouped together upon two ottomans drawn close to each other , five beautiful women were conversing in a tone so low that it almost sank to a whisper ; while their charming countenances wore an expression of mingled suspense and sorrow . They were all in deshabillée , though it was now past four o'clock in the afternoon . This negligence , however , extended only to their attire ; for each of those lovely creatures had bathed her beauteous form in a perfumed bath , and had arranged her hair in the manner best calculated to set off its luxuriance to advantage and at the same time to enhance the charms of that countenance which it enclosed . But farther than this the toilette of those five fascinating girls had not progressed ; and the loose morning - wrappers which they wore , left revealed all the glowing beauties of each voluptuous bust . There was the Scotch charmer , with her brilliant complexion , her auburn hair , and her red cherry lips:—there was the English girl — the pride of Lancashire — with her brown hair , and her robust but exquisitely modelled proportions:—and next to her , on the same ottoman , sate the Irish beauty , whose sparkling black eyes denoted all the fervour of sensuality . On the sofa facing these three women , sate the French wanton , her taper fingers playing with the gold chain which , in the true spirit of coquetry , she had thrown negligently round her neck , and the massive links of which made not the least indentation upon the plump fullness of her bosom . By her side was the Spanish houri , her long black ringlets flowing on the white drapery which set off her transparent olive skin to such exquisite advantage . This group formed an assemblage of charms which would have raised palpitations and excited mysterious fires in the heart of the most heaven - devoted anchorite that ever vowed a life of virgin - purity . And the picture was the more fascinating — the more dangerous , inasmuch as its voluptuousness was altogether unstudied at this moment , and those beauteous creatures noticed not , in their sisterly confidence towards each other , that their glowing and half - naked forms were thus displayed almost as it might have seemed in a spirit of competition and rivalry . But what is the topic of their discourse ? and wherefore has a shade of melancholy displaced those joyous smiles that were wo nt to play upon lips of coral opening above teeth of pearls ? Let us hear them converse . "
991656	991662	991144	991145	the harem	25986	" said the Scotch girl , "
991669	991670	991144	991145	the harem	25986	" "
991680	991687	991673	991674	the Marquis	17209	" added the French - woman . "
991690	991694	991700	991700	he	17209	" observed the English beauty,—"it
991721	991722	991700	991700	he	17209	" "

991764	991769	991731	991732	the lawyers	25989	" cried the Spaniard . "

991800	991806	991791	991791	you	25992	" interposed the French charmer ; "

991836	991842	991833	991833	his	17209	" said the English girl . "
991846	991852	991833	991833	his	17209	" added the Irish beauty . "
991891	991892	991882	991883	the Marquis	17209	" "
991902	991908	991882	991883	the Marquis	17209	" remarked the Scotch girl , "
991951	991952	991939	991939	his	17209	" "
991959	991967	991984	991984	he	17209	" said the Irish beauty , Kathleen ; "
992006	992325	991984	991984	he	17209	" Scarcely were these words uttered , when the door of the apartment opened abruptly ; and the Marquis made his appearance . The five women started from their seats , uttering exclamations of joy . The Marquis bolted the door with great caution , and then advanced towards his ladies with a smile upon his haggard , pale , and death - like countenance . Indeed , it was with the greatest difficulty that the young women could restrain a murmur of surprise — almost of disgust — when , as he drew nearer towards them , they beheld the fearful ravages which a few hours ' illness had made upon his face . The extent of those inroads was moreover enhanced by the absence of his false teeth , which he had not time to fix in his mouth ere he escaped from the thraldom of his physicians : so that the thinness of his cheeks was rendered almost skeleton - like by the sinking in of his mouth . The superb dressing - gown seemed a mockery of the shrivelled and wasted form which it loosely wrapped ; and as the old nobleman staggered towards his mistresses , whose first ebullition of joy at his appearance was so suddenly shocked by the ghastly hideousness of his aspect , they had not strength nor presence of mind to hasten to meet him . Kathleen was the first to conquer her aversion and dismay ; and she caught the Marquis in her arms just at the instant when , overcome by the exertions of the last few minutes , he was about to sink beneath the weight of sheer exhaustion . Then the other women crowded forward to lend their aid ; and the old nobleman was placed upon one of the luxurious ottomans . He closed his eyes , and seemed to breathe with great difficulty . "
992335	992339	991984	991984	he	17209	" exclaimed Kathleen : "
992349	992350	991984	991984	he	17209	" "
992355	992406	991984	991984	he	17209	" murmured the Marquis , in a faint tone ; and , opening his eyes once more , he gazed around him — vacantly at first , then more steadily,—until he seemed to recover visual strength sufficient to distinguish the charming countenances that were fixed upon him with mournful interest ; "
992413	992425	991984	991984	he	17209	" he continued , his voice becoming a trifle more powerful ; "
992451	992466	992447	992447	I	0	" he added with a smile the ghastliness of which all his efforts could not subdue,—"I
992474	992475	992447	992447	I	0	" "
992484	992501	992504	992506	my dear girls	26001	" ejaculated all the women ( save Kathleen ) , shrinking back in terror and dismay . "
992508	992513	992504	992506	my dear girls	26001	" returned the Marquis : "
992557	992558	992561	992562	my lord	27330	" "
992564	992575	992561	992562	my lord	27330	" she repeated , in a tone of kind remonstrance . "
992585	992601	992561	992562	my lord	27330	" cried the nobleman , raising himself partially up on the cushions of the sofa . "
992609	992721	992561	992562	my lord	27330	" The French and Spanish girls hastened to a splendid buffet near the stage at the end of the room , and speedily returned to the vicinity of the ottoman , bearing between them a massive silver salver laden with bottles and glasses . The wine was poured forth : the Marquis desired Kathleen to steady his hand as he conveyed the nectar to his lips ; and he drained the glass of its contents . A hectic tinge appeared upon his cheeks ; his eyes were animated with a partial fire ; and he even seemed happy , as he commanded his ladies to drink bumpers of champagne all round . "
992736	992744	992724	992724	I	0	" he exclaimed , with a smile ; "
992798	992924	992925	992925	Girls	10458	" And for a few minutes the hoary voluptuary , whose licentious passions were dominant even in death , closed his eyes and seemed to enjoy with intense gratification all the luxury of his position . It was a painful and disgusting sight to behold the shrivelled , haggard , and attenuated countenance of the dying sensualist , pressing upon that full and alabaster globe so warm with health , life , and glowing passions;—painful and disgusting , too , to see that thin , emaciated , and worn - out frame reclining in the arms of a lovely girl in the vigour and strength of youth:—hideous — hideous to view that contiguity of a sapless , withered trunk and a robust and verdant tree ! "
992927	992944	992925	992925	Girls	10458	" said the Marquis , at length opening his eyes , but without changing his position , "
993020	993047	993009	993009	your	10458	" The French - woman obeyed this command , and drew forth a sealed packet , addressed to the five ladies by their christian and surnames . "
993051	993056	993009	993009	your	10458	" said the Marquis . "
993094	993151	993082	993082	I	0	" While the nobleman was yet speaking , Anna had opened the packet , whence she drew forth a number of Bank - notes . There were ten — each for a thousand pounds ; and a few words written within the envelope specified that the amount was to be equally divided amongst the five ladies . "
993161	993174	993082	993082	I	0	" exclaimed the French girl , her countenance becoming radiant with joy . "
993178	993184	993082	993082	I	0	" cried the English beauty . "
993188	993194	993082	993082	I	0	" ejaculated the Scotch charmer . "
993207	993217	993218	993218	My	0	" said the Spanish houri . Kathleen simply observed , "
993235	993318	993222	993222	I	0	" The Marquis made no reply ; but taking the delicate white hand of the Irish girl , as he lay pillowed upon her palpitating breast , he gently slipped upon one of her taper fingers a ring of immense value . He then squeezed her hand to enjoin silence ; and this act was not perceived by the other ladies , who were too busily employed in feasting their eyes upon the Bank - notes to pay attention to aught beside . "
993325	993336	993337	993337	I	0	" suddenly exclaimed the Marquis , after a short pause : "
993361	993427	993458	993458	you	26015	" The French girl — to whose mind there was something peculiarly heroical and romantic in the conduct of the Marquis — hastened to obey the order which had been specially addressed to her ; and the sparkling juice of Epernay again moistened the parched throat of the dying man , and also enhanced the carnation tints upon the cheeks of the five youthful beauties . "
993434	993448	993458	993458	you	26015	" said the nobleman , addressing himself to the French and Spanish women , "
993463	993478	993458	993458	you	26015	" he added , turning his glazing eyes upon the Scotch and English girls , "
993498	993695	993696	993696	Kathleen	1515	" The Marquis spoke in a faint and tremulous voice , for he felt himself growing every moment weaker and weaker ; and his head now lay , heavy and motionless , upon the bosom of the Irish girl , whose warm and polished arm was thrown around him . The Scotch and English girls hastened to place themselves , the former before a splendid harp , and the latter at a pianoforte , the magnificent tones of which had never failed to excite the admiration of all who ever heard them . Then the French and Spanish women commenced a slow , languishing , and voluptuous dance , the evolutions of which were well adapted to display the fine proportions of their half - naked forms . A smile relaxed the features of the dying man ; and his glances followed the movements of those foreign girls who vied with each other in assuming the most lascivious attitudes . By degrees , that exciting spectacle grew indistinct to the eyes of the Marquis ; and the music no longer fell upon his ears in varied and defined tones , but with a droning monotonous sound . "
993700	993710	993698	993698	Kathleen	1515	" he murmured , speaking with the utmost difficulty , "
993733	993761	993762	993762	Kathleen	1515	" The Irish girl shuddered in spite of herself — shuddered involuntarily as she felt the cheek of the Marquis grow cold and clammy against her bosom . "
993767	993778	993765	993765	Kathleen	1515	" he murmured in a whisper that was scarcely audible ; "
993784	993996	993999	993999	his	26017	" Conquering her repugnance , the Irish girl , who possessed a kind and generous heart , reached a glass on the table near the sofa ; and , raising the nobleman 's head , she placed the wine to his lips . With a last — last expiring effort , he took the glass in his own hand , and swallowed a few drops of its contents:—his eyes were lighted up again for a moment , and his cheek flushed ; but his head fell back heavily upon the white bosom . Kathleen endeavoured to cry for aid — and could not : a sensation of fainting came over her — she closed her eyes — and a suffocating feeling in the throat almost choked her . But still the music continued and the dance went on , for several minutes more . All at once a shriek emanated from the lips of Kathleen : the music ceased — the dance was abandoned — and the Irish girl 's companions rushed towards the sofa . Their anticipations were realised : the Marquis was no more ! The hope which he had so often expressed in his life - time , was fulfilled almost to the very letter;—for the old voluptuary had "
994022	994709	993765	993765	Kathleen	1515	" It was now the middle of April , 1843 . The morning was fine , and the streets were marked with the bustle of men of business , clerks , and others repairing to their respective offices , when Mr. George Montague Greenwood turned from Saint Paul 's Churchyard into Cheapside . He was attired in a plain , and even somewhat shabby manner : there was not a particle of jewellery about him ; and a keen eye might have discovered , in the tout ensemble of his appearance , that his toilette had been arranged with every endeavour to produce as good an effect as possible . Thus his neckcloth was tied with a precision seldom bestowed upon a faded piece of black silk : his shirt - cuffs were drawn down so as to place an interval of snowy white between the somewhat threadbare sleeve of the blue coat and the common grey glove of Berlin wool:—a black riband hung round his neck and was gathered at the ends in the right pocket of the soiled satin waistcoat , so as to leave the beholder in a state of uncertainty whether it were connected with a watch or only an eye - glass — or , indeed , with any thing at all;—and the Oxford - mixture trousers , rather white at the knees , were strapped tightly over a pair of well - blacked bluchers , a casual observer would certainly have taken for Wellingtons . In his hand he carried a neat black cane ; and his gait was characterised by much of the self - sufficiency which had marked it in better days . It was , however , far removed from a swagger : Greenwood was too much of a gentleman in his habits to fall into the slightest manifestation of vulgarity . His beautiful black hair , curling and glossy , put to shame the brownish hue of the beaver hat which had evidently seen some service , and had lately been exposed to all the varieties of weather peculiar to this capricious climate . His face — eminently handsome , as we have before observed — was pale and rather thin ; but there was a haughty assurance in the proud curl of the upper lip , and a fire in his large dark eyes , which showed that hope was not altogether a stranger to the breast of Mr. George Montague Greenwood . It was about a quarter past nine in the morning when this gentleman entered the great thoroughfare of Cheapside . Perhaps there is no street in all London which presents so many moral phases to the eyes of the acute beholder as this one , and at that hour ; inasmuch as those eyes may single out , and almost read the pursuit of , every individual forming an item in the dense crowd that is then rolling onward to the vicinity of the Bank of England . For of every ten persons , nine are proceeding in that direction . Reader , let us pause for a moment and examine the details of the scene to which we allude : for Greenwood has slackened his pace — his eye has caught sight of Bow clock — and he perceives that he is yet too early to commence the visits which he intends to make in certain quarters . And first , gentle reader , behold that young man with the loose taglioni and no undercoat : he has a devil - me - care kind of look about him , mingled with an air of seediness , as if he had been up the best part of the night at a free - and - easy . He is smoking a cigar — at that hour of the morning ! It is impossible to gaze at him for two seconds , without being convinced that he is an articled clerk to an attorney , and that he does n't care so long as he reaches the office just five minutes before the "
994711	994985	995469	995469	I	0	" arrives . But that old man , with a threadbare suit of black , and the red cotton handkerchief sticking so suspiciously out of his pocket , as if he had something wrapped up in it,—who is he ? Mark how he shuffles along , dragging his heavy high - lows over the pavement at a pace too speedy for his attenuated frame : and see with what anxiety he looks up at the clock projecting out far overhead , to assure himself that he shall yet be at his office within two minutes of half - past nine — or else risk his place and the eighteen shillings a week which it brings him in , and on which he has to support a wife and large family . He is a copying clerk in a lawyer 's office — there can be no doubt of it ; and the poor man has his dinner wrapped up in his pocket - handkerchief ! Do you observe that proud , pompous - looking stout man , with the large yellow cane in his hand , and the massive chain and seals hanging from his fob ? He is a stockbroker who , having got up a bubble Railway Company , has enriched himself in a single day , after having struggled against difficulties for twenty years . But , see — a fashionably - dressed gentleman , with a little too much jewellery about his person , and a rather too severe swagger in his gait , overtakes our stout friend , and passes his arm familiarly in his as he wishes him "
994989	995168	995170	995170	he	26018	" There is no mistake about this individual : he is the Managing - Director of the stockbroker 's Company , and was taken from a three - pair back in the New Cut to preside at the Board . Arcades ambo — a precious pair ! Glance a moment at that great , stout , shabbily - dressed man , whose trousers are so tight that they certainly never could have been made for him , and whose watery boiled - kind of eyes , vacant look , and pale but bloated face , denote the habitual gin - drinker . He rolls along with a staggering gait , as if the effects of the previous night 's debauch had not been slept off , or as if he had already taken his first dram . He is on his way to the neighbourhood of the Bank , where he either loiters about on the steps of the Auction Mart , or at the door of Capel Court , or else proceeds to some public - house parlour "
995173	995464	995170	995170	he	26018	" His business is to hawk bills about for discount ; and , to hear him speak , one would believe that he could raise a million of money in no time — whereas he has most likely the pawn - ticket of his Sunday 's coat in his pocket . And now mark that elderly , sedate , quiet - looking man , whose good black suit is well - brushed and his boots nicely polished . He compares his heavy gold watch with the clock of Bow church , and is quite delighted to see that his time is correct to a second . And now he continues his way , without looking to the right or the left : he knows every feature — every shop — every lamp - post of Cheapside and the Poultry too well to have any farther curiosity about those thoroughfares — for he has passed along that way every morning , Sundays excepted , during the last twenty years . Are you not prepared to make an affidavit that he is a superior clerk in the Bank of England ? But we must abandon any farther scrutiny of the several members of the crowd in Cheapside — at least for the present ; because it is now half - past nine o'clock , and Mr. Greenwood has reached Cornhill . Here he paused — and sighed,—sighed deeply . That sigh told a long and painful history,—of how he had lately been rich and prosperous — how he had lost all by grasping at more — how he was now reduced almost to the very verge of penury — and how he wondered whether he should ever be wealthy and great again ! "
995473	995498	995499	995499	My	0	" he said to himself — speaking not with his lips , but with that silent though emphatic tongue which belongs to the soul . "
995516	995634	995499	995499	My	0	" Then , calling all his assurance to his aid , he turned into the office of a well - known merchant and capitalist on Cornhill . The clerks did not immediately recognise him ; for the last time he had called there , it was at four in the afternoon and he had alighted from an elegant cab : whereas now it was half - past nine in the morning , and he had evidently come on foot . But when he demanded , in his usual authoritative tone , whether their master had arrived yet , they recollected him , and replied in the affirmative . Greenwood accordingly walked into the merchant 's private office . "
995641	995652	995499	995499	My	0	" he said , extending his hand towards the merchant , "
995668	995717	995720	995721	Mr. Greenwood	903	" The merchant affected not to perceive the out - stretched hand ; nor did he return the bland smile with which Mr. Greenwood accosted him . But , just raising his eyes from the morning paper which lay before him , he said in a cold tone , "
995735	995756	995732	995732	your	26649	" The ex - member for Rottenborough took a chair uninvited , and proceeded to observe in a confidential kind of whisper,—"The
995824	995825	995826	995826	I	0	" "
995838	995839	995834	995835	Mr. Greenwood	903	" "
995852	995859	995834	995835	Mr. Greenwood	903	" interrupted the ex - member . "
995884	995885	995886	995886	You	26679	" "
995897	995907	995886	995886	You	26679	" asked the merchant , eyeing his visitor askance . "
995928	995932	995886	995886	You	26679	" returned Greenwood . "
995944	995951	995937	995937	I	0	" said the merchant , drily . "
995960	995964	995937	995937	I	0	" cried Greenwood : "
995970	995971	995937	995937	I	0	" "
995991	995992	995976	995976	I	0	" "
996004	996018	996019	996021	The impertinent scoundrel	26028	" interrupted Greenwood , indignantly ; and he strode out of the office . "
996023	996036	996019	996021	The impertinent scoundrel	26028	" he muttered to himself , when he had gained the street . "
996076	996210	996068	996068	I	0	" In spite of this attempt at self - consolation , Greenwood was deeply mortified with the reception which he had experienced at the merchant 's office : his anger had , however , cooled and his spirits revived by the time he reached Birchin Lane , where dwelt another of his City acquaintances . This individual was a capitalist who had once been saved from serious embarrassment , if not from total ruin , by a timely advance of funds made to him by Greenwood ; and though the capitalist had paid enormous interest for the accommodation , he had nevertheless always exhibited the most profound gratitude towards the ex - member for Rottenborough . It was , therefore , with great confidence that Greenwood entered the private office of the capitalist . "
996217	996229	996068	996068	I	0	" cried the latter , apparently overjoyed to see his visitor , "
996263	996284	996257	996257	I	0	" Greenwood addressed him in terms similar to those which he had used with the merchant a few minutes previously . "
996301	996313	996287	996287	you	26700	" said the capitalist , his entire countenance beaming with smiles . "
996320	996327	996287	996287	you	26700	" answered the ex - member . "
996338	996339	996329	996329	you	26700	" "

996361	996375	996355	996357	a lucky dog	26031	" cried the capitalist , playfully thrusting his fingers into Greenwood 's ribs . "
996387	996397	996383	996383	I	0	" observed the latter , in a measured tone . "
996423	996424	996411	996411	I	0	" "
996432	996437	996411	996411	I	0	" exclaimed the capitalist . "

996488	996492	996478	996478	you	0	" said Greenwood . "

996537	996541	996525	996525	you	0	" asked Greenwood . "
996547	996552	996544	996544	your	26700	" cried the other ; "
996594	996606	996607	996607	I	0	" he added , sinking his voice to a mysterious whisper , "
996624	996625	996607	996607	I	0	" "
996628	996632	996607	996607	I	0	" exclaimed Greenwood . "

996670	996675	996654	996654	I	0	" said the capitalist : "

996703	996707	996687	996687	I	0	" continued Greenwood , "

996816	996830	996773	996773	you	0	City!"—and the capitalist chuckled , as if he had uttered a splendid joke . "
996837	996857	996859	996859	you	0	" said Greenwood , relishing this mirth as little as a person in his situation was likely to do ; "
996916	996917	996897	996897	I	0	" "
996931	996936	996897	996897	I	0	" answered the capitalist : "
996960	997183	996941	996941	I	0	" Greenwood rose , put on his hat , and left the office without uttering another word . He felt that he was righteously punished — for he had , in his time , often treated men in the same manner,—professing ardent friendship , and yet refusing the smallest pecuniary favour ! Having walked about for nearly half an hour , to calm the feelings which the conduct of the capitalist had so painfully excited , Greenwood repaired to the office of a great bill - discounter and speculator in Broad Street . This individual had been a constant visitor at Greenwood 's house in Spring Gardens — had joined him in many of his most profitable speculations — and had gained considerable sums thereby . He was , moreover , of a very enterprising character , and always ready to risk money with the hope of large returns . Greenwood entered the clerks ' office ; and , glancing towards the private one at the lower extremity , he caught sight of the speculator 's countenance peering over the blinds of the glass - door which opened between the two rooms . The face was instantly withdrawn ; and Greenwood , who of course affected not to have observed its appearance at the window , inquired whether the speculator was within . "
997192	997214	997185	997185	I	0	" drawled a clerk , who was mending a pen : then , without desisting from his operation , he said , "

997236	997242	997215	997215	I	0	" exclaimed Greenwood , angrily . "
997251	997252	997245	997245	you	0	" "
997263	997334	997261	997261	sir	26649	" returned the clerk ; and , having duly nibbed the pen , he dismounted very leisurely from his stool — paused to arrange a piece of blotting - paper on the desk in a very precise manner indeed — brushed the splinters of the quill from his trousers — and then dragged himself in a lazy fashion towards the private office . Greenwood bit his quivering lip with rage . "
997339	997345	997261	997261	sir	26649	" he thought to himself , "
997354	997397	997398	997399	The governor	28195	" Meantime the clerk entered the inner office , and carefully closed the door behind him . Greenwood could hear the murmuring sounds of two voices within . At length the clerk re - appeared , and said in a careless tone , "
997455	997456	997446	997447	the governor	28195	" "
997468	997488	997457	997457	I	0	" returned Greenwood , his heart ready to break at the cool , deliberate insult thus put upon him . "
997507	997508	997497	997497	you	0	" "
997515	997524	997525	997526	every one	27275	" interrupted the clerk , with impertinent emphasis , "
997548	998450	997536	997537	my governor	26051	" Greenwood 's countenance became scarlet as these bitter taunts met his ears ; and for a moment he felt inclined to rush upon the insolent clerk and punish him severely with his cane . But , being naturally of a cool and cautious disposition , he perceived with a second thought that he might only become involved in a dilemma from which he had no means to extricate himself : so , conquering his passion , he rushed out of the office . He could now no longer remain blind to the cruel conviction that the extremities of his position were well known in the City , and that the hopes with which he had sallied forth three hours previously were mere delusive visions . Still he was resolved to leave no stone unturned in the endeavour to retrieve his ruined fortunes ; but feeling sick at heart and the prey to a deep depression of spirits , he plunged hastily into a public - house to take some refreshment . And now behold the once splendid and fastidious Greenwood,—the man who had purchased the votes of a constituency , and had even created a sensation within the walls of Parliament,—the individual who had discounted bills of large amount for some of the greatest peers of England , and whose luxurious mode of living had once been the envy and wonder of the fashionable world,—behold the ex - member for Rottenborough partaking of a pint of porter and a crust of bread and cheese in the dingy parlour of a public - house ! There was a painful knitting of the brows , and there was a nervous quivering of the lip , which denoted the acute emotions to which he was a prey , as he partook of his humble fare ; and once — once , two large tears trickled down his cheeks , and moistened the bread that he was conveying to his mouth . For he thought of the times when money was as dirt in his estimation,—when he rode in splendid vehicles , sate down to sumptuous repasts , was ministered unto by a host of servants in gorgeous liveries , and revelled in the arms of the loveliest women of the metropolis . Oh ! he thought of all this : he recalled to mind the well - filled wardrobes he had once possessed , and glanced at his present faded attire;—he shook up the remains of the muddy beer at the bottom of the pewter - pot , and remembered the gold he had lavished on champagne : his eyes lingered upon the crumbs of the bread and the rind of the cheese left on the plate , and his imagination became busy with the reminiscences of the turtle and venison that had once smoked upon his board . But worse — oh ! far worse than this was the dread conviction that all his lavish expenditure — all his ostentatious display — all his princely feasts , had failed to secure him a single friend ! No wonder , then , that the bitter — bitter tears started from his eyes ; and , though he immediately checked that first ebullition of heart - felt anguish yet the effort only caused the storm of emotions to rage the more painfully within his breast . For , in imagination , he cast his eyes towards a mansion a few miles distant ; and there he beheld one whose condition formed a striking contrast with his own — one who had suddenly burst from obscurity and created for himself as proud a name as might be found in Christendom,—a young man whose indomitable energies and honourable aspirations had enabled him to lead armies to conquest , and who had taken his place amongst the greatest Princes in the universe ! The comparison which Greenwood drew — despite of himself — between the elevated position of Richard Markham and his own fallen , ruined lot , produced feelings of so painful — so exquisitely agonising a nature , that he could endure them no longer . He felt that they were goading him to madness — the more so because he was alone in that dingy parlour at the time , and was therefore the least likely to struggle against them successfully . Hastily quitting the public - house , he rushed into the street , where the fresh air seemed to do him good . And then he asked himself whether he should risk farther insult by calling upon other wealthy men with whom he had once been on intimate terms ? For a few moments he was inclined to abandon the idea : but a little calm reflection told him not to despair . Moreover , he had a reason — a powerful motive for exerting all his energies to repair the past , so far as his worldly fortunes were concerned ; and though the idea was almost insane , he hoped — if he had but a chance — to make such good use of the coming few weeks as would reinstate him in the possession of enormous wealth . But , alas ! it seemed as if no one would listen to the scheme which he felt convinced was calculated to return millions for the risk of a few thousands ! "
998464	998475	997536	997537	my governor	26051	" he thought , as he hurried towards Moorgate Street . "
998493	998577	998626	998626	Greenwood	903	" This idea brought a smile to his lips ; and , relaxing his pace , he composed his countenance as well as he could ere he entered the office of a wealthy stockbroker in Moorgate Street . The stockbroker was lounging over the clerks ' desk , conversing with a merchant whom Greenwood also knew ; and the moment the ex - member for Rottenborough entered , the two City gentlemen treated him to a long , impertinent , and contemptuous stare . "
998580	998601	998602	998602	you	26053	" said Greenwood , affecting a pleasant smile , which , God knows ! did not come from the heart ; "
998620	998621	998626	998626	Greenwood	903	" "
998636	998656	998626	998626	Greenwood	903	" drawled the stockbroker , turning towards his friend the merchant in a manner that was equivalent to saying , "
998666	998667	998672	998672	Greenwood	903	" "
998674	998687	998672	998672	Greenwood	903	" observed the merchant , putting his glasses up to his eyes : "
998702	998703	998695	998695	I	0	" "
998710	998715	998695	998695	I	0	" chuckled the stockbroker . "
998725	998738	998716	998716	You	26053	" said the object of this intended witticism but really galling insult : "
998752	998753	998754	998754	I	0	" "
998761	998766	998754	998754	I	0	" interrupted the stockbroker , "
998796	998797	998832	998834	a certain capitalist	26058	" "
998801	998830	998832	998834	a certain capitalist	26058	" said Greenwood , determined to receive all this sarcasm as quietly as a poor devil ought to do when about to make a proposal requiring an advance of funds,—"and
998857	998858	998832	998834	a certain capitalist	26058	" "
998865	998870	998832	998834	a certain capitalist	26058	" laughed the stockbroker . "
998877	998882	998875	998875	he	26058	" chuckled the merchant . "
998891	998896	998914	998914	he	33389	" continued the broker , "
998947	998948	998949	998949	He	26058	" "
998955	998961	998953	998953	he	26058	" again chuckled the merchant . "
998968	999091	998953	998953	he	26058	" once more laughed the stockbroker ; and , taking his friend 's arm , he led him into his private office , the two continuing to laugh and chuckle until the door closed behind them . Greenwood now became aware of the gratifying fact that every clerk in the counting - house was laughing also ; and he rushed out into the street , a prey to feelings of the most agonising nature . But the ignominy of that day was not yet complete in respect to him . As he darted away from the door of the insolent stockbroker 's office , he came in collision with two gentlemen who were walking arm - in - arm towards the Bank . "
999102	999117	999118	999118	Greenwood	903	" began one , rubbing his arm which had been hurt by the encounter . "
999120	999170	999118	999118	Greenwood	903	" cried the second , stepping back in surprise . The ex - member for Rottenborough raised his eyes at the sounds of those well - known voices , and beheld Mr. Chichester , with his inseparable friend the baronet , both eyeing him in the most insulting manner . "
999179	999184	999173	999173	Greenwood	903	" exclaimed Sir Rupert ; "
999236	999237	999224	999224	you	903	" "
999247	999251	999224	999224	you	903	" cried Chichester . "
999259	999260	999224	999224	you	903	" "
999274	999282	999283	999284	And bluchers	26067	" added the baronet , laughing heartily . "
999287	999642	999283	999284	And bluchers	26067	" Greenwood stayed to hear no more : he broke from the hold which the two friends had laid upon him , and darted down an alley into Coleman Street . Greenwood had been insulted by those wealthy citizens who once considered themselves honoured by his notice ; and this he might have borne , because he was man of the world enough to know that poverty is a crime in the eyes of plodding , money - making persons . But to be made the jest of a couple of despicable adventurers — to be jeered at by two knaves for whom he entertained the most sovereign contempt , because their rascalities had been conducted on a scale of mean swindling rather than in the colourable guise of financial enterprise,—to be laughed at and mocked by such men as those , because they happened to have good clothes upon their backs,—Oh ! this was a crushing — an intolerable insult ! The unhappy Greenwood felt it most keenly : he writhed beneath the sharp lash of that bitter sarcasm which had been hurled against his shabby appearance;—he groaned under the scourge of those contemptuous scoffs ! Sanguine as his disposition naturally was,—confident as he ever felt in his own talents for intrigue and scheming,—he was now suddenly cast down ; and hope fled from his soul . Not for worlds would he have risked the chance of receiving farther insult that day , by calling at the counting - house of another capitalist ! And now he fled from the City with a species of loathing,—as much depressed by disappointment as he had been elated by hope when he entered it a few hours previously . He crossed Blackfriars ' Bridge , turned into Holland Street , and thence entered John Street , where he knocked timidly at the door of a house of very mean appearance . A stout , vulgar - looking woman , with carrotty hair , tangled as a mat , overshadowing a red and bloated face , thrust her head out of the window on the first floor . "
999645	999654	999283	999284	And bluchers	26067	" she cried , in an impertinent tone . "
999668	999697	999656	999656	you	26068	" said Greenwood , calling to his aid all that blandness of manner which had once served him us a powerful auxiliary in his days of extensive intrigue . "
999701	999707	999656	999656	you	26068	" was the abrupt reply . "
999716	999717	999718	999719	Mrs. Brown	1868	" "
999730	999744	999718	999719	Mrs. Brown	1868	" said the unhappy man , who saw that a storm was impending . "
999754	999755	999718	999719	Mrs. Brown	1868	" "
999763	999785	999718	999719	Mrs. Brown	1868	" shouted the landlady of the house , for the behoof of all her neighbours who were lounging at their doors . "
999827	999828	999831	999832	Mrs. Brown	1868	" "
999835	999836	999831	999832	Mrs. Brown	1868	" "
999843	999860	999839	999840	Mrs. Brown	1868	" interrupted the woman , hanging half way out of the window , and gesticulating violently . "
999880	999881	999839	999840	Mrs. Brown	1868	" "
999890	999923	999886	999888	dear Mrs. Brown	1868	" inquired a woman , with a child in her arms , stepping from the door of the adjoining dwelling to the kerb - stone , and looking up at the window . "
999928	999957	999886	999888	dear Mrs. Brown	1868	" vociferated Greenwood 's landlady , who only required such a question as the one just put to her in order to work herself into a towering passion : "
1000037	1000038	1000018	1000019	Mrs. Sugden	1869	" "
1000041	1000057	1000018	1000019	Mrs. Sugden	1869	" cried Mrs. Sugden , darting a look of fierce indignation upon the miserable Greenwood . "
1000064	1000076	1000018	1000019	Mrs. Sugden	1869	" continued Mrs. Brown , now literally foaming at the mouth : "
1000111	1000113	1000096	1000097	my husband	27376	" . "
1000118	1000145	1000096	1000097	my husband	27376	" ejaculated Mrs. Sugden , casting up her eyes to heaven , as if she could not have thought the world capable of such an atrocity . "
1000179	1000321	1000151	1000152	that feller	32577	" Greenwood stayed to hear no more : he perceived that all hope of obtaining admission to his lodging was useless ; and he accordingly stole off , followed by the abuse of Mrs. Brown , the opprobrious epithets of Mrs. Sugden , and the scoffs of half - a - dozen of the neighbours . It was now four o'clock in the afternoon ; and Greenwood found himself retracing his way over Blackfriars ' Bridge , without knowing whither he was going — or without even having any place to go to . He was literally houseless — homeless ! His few shirts and other necessaries were left behind at the lodging which had just been closed against him ; and a few halfpence in his pocket , besides the garments upon his back , were all his worldly possessions . "
1000329	1000362	1000151	1000152	that feller	32577	" he thought within himself , as he hurried over the bridge , not noticing the curiosity excited on the part of the crowd by his strange looks and wildness of manner : "
1000400	1000587	1000588	1000588	We	26081	" And he hurried franticly along — hell raging in his bosom . At length it suddenly struck him that he was gesticulating violently in the open street and in the broad day - light ; and he was overwhelmed with a sense of deep shame and profound humiliation . He rushed across Bridge Street , with the intention of plunging into one of those lanes leading towards Whitefriars ; when a cry of alarm resounded in his ears — and in another moment he was knocked down by a cabriolet that was driving furiously along . The wheel passed over his right leg ; and a groan of agony escaped him . The vehicle instantly stopped : the livery servant behind sprang to the ground ; and , with the aid of a policeman who came up to the spot the instant the accident occurred , the domestic raised Greenwood from the pavement . But an agonising cry , wrung from him by the excruciating pain which he felt in his right leg , showed that he was seriously injured ; and the policeman said , "
1000596	1000615	1000588	1000588	We	26081	" There were two gentlemen in the cabriolet ; and one of them , leaning out , said , "
1000627	1000628	1000625	1000625	him	26082	" "
1000639	1000675	1000676	1000677	My gwathiouth	26086	" demanded the other gentleman , also thrusting forward his head . Greenwood recognised their voices , and turned his face towards them in an imploring manner : but he suffered too acutely to speak . "
1000681	1000697	1000676	1000677	My gwathiouth	26086	" cried Sir Cherry Bounce , who was one of the inmates of the cab : "
1000706	1000707	1000712	1000712	Cherry	1051	" "
1000717	1000724	1000727	1000727	policeman	39085	" ejaculated the Honourable Major Dapper . "
1000743	1000744	1000731	1000731	he	26082	" "
1000751	1000756	1000761	1000761	Cherry	1051	" echoed Sir Cherry . "
1000767	1000772	1000764	1000765	a fool	3208	" cried the Major . "
1000823	1000824	1000821	1000821	yourself	1051	" "
1000829	1000834	1000821	1000821	yourself	1051	" returned the officer : "
1000858	1000859	1000838	1000838	you	26649	" "
1000866	1000871	1000838	1000838	you	26649	" exclaimed Sir Cherry . "
1000876	1000884	1000838	1000838	you	26649	" said the Honourable Major Smilax Dapper . "
1000935	1000936	1000933	1000933	John	1715	" "
1000942	1001239	1000933	1000933	John	1715	" cried the servant , springing up behind the vehicle . And away went the cabriolet with the rapidity of lightning . In the meantime a crowd had collected ; and amongst the spectators thus assembled were two individuals who seemed to take a more than common interest in the painful scene . One was Filippo , who happened to be passing at the moment : but he kept behind the crowd , so that Greenwood might not perceive him . The other was the hump - back Gibbet , whom accident likewise made a witness of the event , and who , observing the cruel indifference with which the gentlemen in the cab had treated a misfortune caused by themselves , felt suddenly interested in behalf of the victim of their carelessness . The policeman procured a stretcher ; and , with the aid of two or three of the idlers whom the accident had collected to the spot , he conveyed Greenwood to Saint Bartholomew 's Hospital . Filippo hurried rapidly away the moment he saw his late master removed in the manner described ; but Gibbet , who , we should observe , was clad in deep mourning , walked by the side of the procession . Greenwood fainted , through excessive pain , while he was being conveyed to the hospital ; and when he came to himself again , he was lying in a narrow bed , upon a hard mattress stretched on an iron framework , while the house - surgeon was setting his leg , which had been broken . The room was long and crowded with beds , in each of which there was a patient ; for this was the Casualty Ward of Saint Bartholomew 's Hospital . "
1001248	1001265	1001266	1001270	Two gentlemen in a cab	26103	" said the house - surgeon to the police - officer , who was standing by . "
1001282	1001287	1001288	1001288	They	26103	" was the answer . "
1001358	1001359	1001343	1001343	I	0	" "
1001364	1001371	1001343	1001343	I	0	" said the surgeon , impatiently : "
1001399	1001400	1001396	1001397	Mrs. Jubkins	1871	" "
1001405	1001413	1001403	1001403	sir	26649	" said a nurse , stepping forward . "
1001426	1001450	1001423	1001424	Mrs. Jubkins	1871	" continued the house - surgeon , behind whom stood two assistants , termed dressers , and smelling awfully of rum and tobacco : "
1001518	1001519	1001520	1001521	The Eye	26117	" "
1001540	1001550	1001538	1001538	sir	26649	" replied the head nurse of the Casualty Ward . "
1001571	1001572	1001573	1001574	The Ribs	26121	" "
1001578	1001586	1001573	1001574	The Ribs	26121	" answered the nurse , somewhat indignantly , "
1001608	1001609	1001606	1001606	sir	26649	" "
1001622	1001627	1001614	1001615	Mrs. Jubkins	1871	" said the surgeon : "
1001650	1001651	1001640	1001640	he	26736	" "
1001658	1001663	1001640	1001640	he	26736	" observed the nurse . "
1001676	1001677	1001679	1001680	the Nose	26126	" "
1001690	1001746	1001679	1001680	the Nose	26126	" The surgeon then felt Greenwood 's pulse , gave Mrs. Jubkins a few necessary directions , and was about to proceed to the next ward to visit a Brain , which also had a compound fracture of the arm , when he suddenly espied Gibbet near the head of the new patient 's bed . "
1001753	1001758	1001762	1001762	you	27449	" said the surgeon ; "
1001765	1001766	1001769	1001769	sir	26649	" "
1001771	1001775	1001769	1001769	sir	26649	" answered Gibbet , "
1001811	1001812	1001793	1001793	I	0	" "
1001821	1001833	1001793	1001793	I	0	" murmured Greenwood , in a faint and yet earnest tone . "
1001844	1001849	1001836	1001836	you	27449	" said the surgeon : "
1001856	1001864	1001865	1001865	you	27449	" he added , speaking to Gibbet , "
1001876	1001877	1001865	1001865	you	27449	" "
1001886	1001967	1001865	1001865	you	27449	" was the answer . The surgeon , the nurse , and the dressers moved away : the policeman had already taken his departure ; and Greenwood was therefore enabled to speak without reserve to the kind - hearted hump - back who had manifested so generous an interest in his behalf . And now behold Gibbet — the late hangman 's son — leaning over the pallet of the once fashionable , courted , and influential George Montague Greenwood . "
1001980	1001993	1001865	1001865	you	27449	" said the latter , in a very faint and low tone , "
1002010	1002011	1002007	1002007	your	27449	" "
1002019	1002023	1002007	1002007	your	27449	" interrupted Gibbet . "
1002036	1002037	1002038	1002038	I	0	" "
1002041	1002045	1002038	1002038	I	0	" continued Greenwood . "
1002062	1002063	1002038	1002038	I	0	" "
1002067	1002075	1002038	1002038	I	0	" said Gibbet , with a start . "
1002083	1002084	1002079	1002079	you	27449	" "
1002107	1002108	1002096	1002099	The Prince of Montoni	23151	" "
1002114	1002118	1002096	1002099	The Prince of Montoni	23151	" murmured Greenwood . "
1002133	1002134	1002125	1002130	a young lady named Miss Monroe	26141	" "
1002149	1002150	1002139	1002139	she	26141	" "
1002163	1002167	1002157	1002157	I	0	" said Greenwood . "
1002207	1002208	1002209	1002209	Your	0	" "
1002222	1002223	1002256	1002256	her	26141	" "
1002230	1002250	1002252	1002252	her	26141	" interrupted Greenwood , with a sad smile , which was not , however , altogether devoid of bitterness : "
1002288	1002297	1002282	1002282	her	26141	" he added , after a short pause , "
1002311	1002312	1002313	1002313	Your	0	" "
1002322	1002416	1002313	1002313	Your	0	" replied Gibbet . Greenwood expressed his thanks ; and the hump - back took his departure . It was at about eight o'clock in the evening when Gibbet alighted from a cab at the entrance of Markham Place . He knocked timidly at the door ; but the servant who answered the summons received him with respect — for not the veriest mendicant that crawled upon the face of the earth ever met with an insulting glance nor a harsh word from any inmate of that dwelling . To Gibbet 's question whether "
1002423	1002586	1002417	1002417	His	26149	" the domestic replied by a courteous invitation to enter ; and being shown into a parlour — the very same where more than two years previously he and his father had one evening supped with our hero — he was shortly joined by the Prince . The hump - back , well as he had been enabled to judge of the excellent qualities of Richard , was nevertheless surprised at the kind and affable manner in which that exalted personage hastened forward to welcome him ; and tears of gratitude rolled down the poor creature 's face as he felt his hands clasped in those of one whom he so profoundly respected and so enthusiastically admired . Markham made him sit down , and rang the bell for wine and refreshments : then , noticing that the hump - back was in deep mourning , he hastened to question him as to the cause — which he nevertheless could well divine . "
1002592	1002596	1002589	1002590	my lord	27330	" answered Gibbet , "
1002633	1002634	1002614	1002614	he	27039	" "
1002642	1002646	1002636	1002636	yourself	27330	" said Richard ; "
1002663	1002664	1002614	1002614	he	27039	" "
1002674	1002682	1002614	1002614	he	27039	" continued Gibbet , drying his tears , "
1002766	1002767	1002769	1002769	yourself	27330	" "
1002774	1002778	1002779	1002779	you	27330	" said Markham : "
1002784	1002785	1002786	1002786	I	0	" "
1002792	1002797	1002786	1002786	I	0	" proceeded John Smithers , "
1002838	1002839	1002840	1002840	Katherine	1864	" "
1002846	1002852	1002853	1002853	You	27330	" said Richard , kindly . "
1002887	1002888	1002891	1002892	my lord	27330	" "
1002901	1002911	1002895	1002895	you	27330	" ejaculated Gibbet , wiping his eyes once more . "
1003164	1003165	1003156	1003156	he	2156	" "
1003187	1003191	1003176	1003176	your	0	" exclaimed Richard . "
1003199	1003200	1003201	1003201	I	0	" "
1003527	1003528	1003522	1003522	he	2156	" "
1003536	1003552	1003522	1003522	he	2156	" said Markham , wiping away a tear , while Gibbet 's eyes were streaming , "
1003607	1003608	1003611	1003612	my lord	27330	" "
1003619	1003623	1003611	1003612	my lord	27330	" ejaculated Gibbet : "
1003658	1003659	1003660	1003660	You	36629	" "
1003671	1003677	1003660	1003660	You	36629	" said Markham , emphatically . "
1003695	1003712	1003683	1003683	I	0	" answered Gibbet , conquering his emotions and speaking more firmly than he had yet done . "
1003736	1003783	1003786	1003787	my lord	27330	" Richard surveyed the hump - back with unfeigned astonishment;—and this sentiment was strangely increased , when the poor creature , suddenly yielding to the impulse of his emotions , fell at our hero 's feet , and catching hold of both his hands , exclaimed , "
1003974	1004061	1004062	1004062	My	0	" Gibbet had spoken with such strange rapidity and such wild — startling — almost frenzied energy,—and the revelation his words conveyed had so astonished our hero , that the sudden seriousness which his countenance assumed was mistaken by the poor hump - back for severity . But this error was speedily dissipated , when Markham , recovering from his bewilderment , raised him from the floor , conducted him to a seat , and , leaning over him , said in the kindest possible manner , "
1004126	1004127	1004128	1004128	I	0	" "
1004139	1004149	1004135	1004135	I	0	" cried Gibbet , tears streaming from his eyes : "
1004209	1004223	1004206	1004206	my	0	" he added , hastily wiping his eyes and assuming a calm demeanour , "
1004245	1004246	1004250	1004250	you	0	" "
1004257	1004262	1004250	1004250	you	0	" said the Prince . "
1004280	1004326	1004272	1004272	you	0	" Gibbet gave a reluctant consent ; and , when his feelings were entirely calmed , Richard introduced him into the drawing - room where Isabella , Katherine and her husband , Ellen and Mr. Monroe were seated . And here the reader may exclaim , "
1004355	1004779	1004780	1004780	My	0	" Yes , reader : and it was precisely because this poor creature was deformed — an orphan — with what many might term a stigma on his parentage — and so lonely and desolate in the world , that Richard Markham took him by the hand , and introduced him into the bosom of his domesticity . But the Prince also knew that the unfortunate hump - back possessed a heart that might have done honour to a monarch ; and our hero looked not to personal appearance — nor to birth — nor to fortune — nor to name,—but to the qualities of the mind ! And Isabella , who had heard all the previous history of those with whom Katherine had passed so many years of her life , welcomed that poor deformed creature even as her husband had welcomed him,—welcomed him , too , the more kindly because he was so deformed ! But we shall not dwell upon this scene:—we shall leave our readers to picture to themselves the delight of Katherine at beholding him whom she had long believed to be her cousin , and who was ever ready to catch the stripes that were destined for her,—her sorrow when she heard of the death of the hump - back 's father,—and the happiness experienced by Gibbet himself at passing an evening in the society of the inmates of Markham Place . Accident enabled him to obtain a few moments ' conversation aside with Ellen ; and to her he broke in as few words but in as delicate a manner as possible , the sad news which he had to communicate relative to Greenwood . The young lady suppressed her grief as well as she could ; but she shortly afterwards pleaded indisposition and retired early to her room — there to ponder and weep , without fear of interruption , over the fallen fortunes of her husband ! On the following morning , Gibbet — true to his resolve , which our hero no longer attempted to shake — took his departure from Markham Place , laden with the presents which had been forced upon him , and followed by the kindest wishes of those good friends whom he left behind . Eliza Sydney had just sate down to breakfast , when a cab drove hastily up to the door of the villa , and Ellen alighted from the vehicle . The moment she entered the parlour , Eliza advanced to meet her , saying , "
1004815	1004824	1004805	1004805	my	0	" Ellen heard these remarks with unfeigned surprise . "
1004832	1004836	1004805	1004805	my	0	" continued Eliza , "
1004854	1004855	1004838	1004838	I	0	" "
1004867	1004891	1004838	1004838	I	0	" exclaimed Ellen , taking a chair near her friend , upon whose countenance she turned a look of mingled curiosity and suspense . "
1004899	1004903	1004838	1004838	I	0	" answered Eliza : "
1004925	1004926	1004922	1004923	a friend	26800	" "
1004933	1004941	1004922	1004923	a friend	26800	" cried Ellen , bursting into tears . "
1004953	1004954	1004947	1004947	you	26765	" "
1004964	1004968	1004947	1004947	you	26765	" interrupted Eliza . "
1004973	1004977	1004947	1004947	you	26765	" ejaculated Ellen . "
1005012	1005013	1004996	1004996	me	0	" "
1005020	1005031	1005032	1005032	you	26765	" cried Ellen , throwing herself into Eliza 's arms , "
1005069	1005070	1005032	1005032	you	26765	" "
1005073	1005083	1005032	1005032	you	26765	" answered Eliza , returning the embrace of friendship ; "
1005164	1005165	1005166	1005166	You	26765	" "
1005174	1005178	1005172	1005172	Eliza	902	" cried Ellen . "
1005199	1005200	1005201	1005201	He	27376	" "
1005214	1005220	1005201	1005201	He	27376	" answered Eliza , emphatically : "
1005259	1005260	1005264	1005264	me	0	" "
1005278	1005282	1005284	1005284	your	902	" ejaculated Ellen : "
1005299	1005300	1005301	1005301	You	902	" "
1005309	1005313	1005301	1005301	You	902	" said Eliza ; "
1005376	1005377	1005361	1005361	he	27376	" "
1005380	1005388	1005389	1005389	you	902	" cried Ellen , with a start : "
1005394	1005395	1005389	1005389	you	902	" "
1005413	1005417	1005400	1005400	you	26713	" said Eliza . "
1005510	1005511	1005504	1005504	He	27376	" "
1005515	1005527	1005512	1005513	Filippo Dorsenni	1271	" exclaimed Ellen , a light breaking in upon her mind : "
1005535	1005536	1005512	1005513	Filippo Dorsenni	1271	" "
1005556	1005567	1005539	1005539	you	26713	" inquired Eliza , in a sweet tone of conciliation . "
1005574	1005578	1005539	1005539	you	26713	" cried Ellen : "
1005599	1005600	1005601	1005601	I	0	" "
1005607	1005612	1005601	1005601	I	0	" was the reply ; "
1005638	1005639	1005626	1005626	he	27403	" "
1005652	1005656	1005658	1005661	the same generous man	26244	" said Ellen ; "
1005686	1005687	1005658	1005661	the same generous man	26244	" "
1005696	1005700	1005701	1005701	you	26713	" observed Eliza , "
1005845	1005846	1005862	1005862	you	902	" "
1005856	1005860	1005862	1005862	you	902	" asked Ellen , "
1005872	1005873	1005862	1005862	you	902	" "
1005878	1005884	1005862	1005862	you	902	" replied the royal widow , "
1005923	1005924	1005912	1005912	you	26713	" "
1005935	1005954	1005912	1005912	you	26713	" cried Ellen , recalling to mind the details of that memorable meeting to which Eliza Sydney alluded . "
1005962	1005968	1005956	1005956	Filippo	1271	" continued the royal widow ; "
1006059	1006087	1006048	1006048	she	26252	" Ellen again threw herself into the arms of the generous - hearted widow , upon whose bosom she poured forth tears of the most profound gratitude . "
1006091	1006095	1006097	1006097	you	26713	" said Eliza , "
1006113	1006114	1006097	1006097	you	26713	" "
1006122	1006126	1006097	1006097	you	26713	" returned Ellen , "
1006168	1006169	1006154	1006154	I	0	" "
1006193	1006199	1006190	1006190	Richard	874	" added Eliza , emphatically . "
1006203	1006209	1006210	1006210	I	0	" continued Ellen , mournfully , "
1006259	1006260	1006263	1006263	your	26713	" "
1006266	1006272	1006273	1006273	My	0	" said Eliza , interrogatively . "
1006277	1006281	1006273	1006273	My	0	" answered Ellen . "
1006288	1006298	1006285	1006285	my	0	" exclaimed the widow , after a brief pause . "
1006376	1006377	1006378	1006379	Dearest friend	6572	" "
1006381	1006385	1006388	1006388	your	6572	" exclaimed Ellen , "
1006469	1006470	1006442	1006442	he	1271	" "
1006485	1006489	1006491	1006491	Filippo	1271	" said Eliza , "
1006521	1006659	1006662	1006662	ma'am	26745	" Ellen expressed the deepest gratitude to her friend for the kind interest thus manifested in behalf of herself and her husband ; and , having taken an affectionate leave of the royal widow , she repaired to Saint Bartholomew 's Hospital . The clock of the establishment was striking eleven when Ellen alighted from the cab at the entrance in Duke Street ; and , having inquired her way to the Casualty Ward , she crossed the courtyard towards the department of the building where her husband lay . Ascending a wide staircase , she reached a landing , where she accosted a nurse who was passing from one room to another at the moment . Ellen intimated her request to see the gentleman who was brought in with a broken leg on the preceding afternoon . "
1006664	1006669	1006670	1006670	you	26745	" answered the nurse , "
1006728	1006729	1006720	1006723	a many male inwalids	26269	" "
1006745	1006762	1006720	1006723	a many male inwalids	26269	" said Ellen , in a low tone , and with tears trickling down her cheeks . "
1006775	1006780	1006765	1006767	poor dear thing	26271	" observed Mrs. Jubkins . "
1006788	1006807	1006783	1006783	I	0	" replied Ellen , eagerly catching at the hint with which the curiosity of the woman furnished her . "
1006817	1006822	1006809	1006809	I	0	" said the nurse , "
1006878	1007189	1006855	1006857	the male Casualty	26277	" Thus speaking , Mrs. Jubkins threw open the door of a small room , into which she showed Ellen , who availed herself of that opportunity to slip a guinea into her hand . Mrs. Jubkins expressed her thanks by a nod , and hurried away with the assurance that she should not be many minutes absent . When the door had closed behind the nurse , Ellen surveyed , with a rapid glance , the room in which she now found herself . It was small , but exquisitely clean and well ventilated . There were four beds in the place , only one of which was occupied . Obeying a mechanical impulse , rather than any sentiment of curiosity , Ellen glanced towards that couch which was tenanted by an invalid ; but she started with mingled surprise and horror as her own bright eyes encountered the glassy ones that stared at her from the pillow . For a moment she averted her head as if from some loathsome spectacle ; but again she looked towards the bed , to satisfy herself whether the suspicion which had struck her were correct or not . Yes — that idea was indeed well - founded ; for there — in a dying state , with her hideous countenance rendered ghastly by disease — lay the old hag of Golden Lane ! A faint attempt at a smile relaxed the rigid expression of the harridan 's death - like face , as she recognised Ellen ; and her toothless jaws moved for a moment as if she were endeavouring to speak:—but she evidently had not strength to utter a word . All on a sudden the boundless aversion which the young lady entertained towards the wretch , became changed into a sentiment of deep commiseration ; and Ellen exclaimed involuntarily , "
1007208	1007251	1006855	1006857	the male Casualty	26277	" The bed shook as if with a convulsive shudder on the part of the hag , whose countenance , upturned towards Ellen , wore an expression which — intelligible amidst all the ghastly ugliness of that face — seemed to say , "
1007263	1007296	1007256	1007256	you	26280	" Ellen understood what was passing in the old woman 's mind at the moment ; and , advancing nearer to the couch , she said in a tone tremulous with emotions , "
1007377	1007380	1007374	1007375	a wife	26722	" she added proudly,—"holier
1007433	1007464	1007467	1007469	that old woman	31072	" At that moment the door opened , and Mrs. Jubkins returned to the room . Ellen cast another glance of forgiveness upon the hag and hurried into the passage . "
1007471	1007491	1007467	1007469	that old woman	31072	" she asked , in a low tone , when the door had closed behind herself and the nurse . "
1007503	1007509	1007501	1007501	Miss	26286	" replied the hospital nurse , "
1007676	1007684	1007657	1007657	she	26813	" added the nurse , recollecting herself , "
1007721	1007722	1007701	1007701	she	26813	" "
1007732	1007742	1007743	1007745	The Resurrection Man	3220	" asked Ellen , with some degree of curiosity . "
1007747	1007755	1007743	1007745	The Resurrection Man	3220	" replied the nurse , shuddering visibly . "
1007814	1007993	1007994	1007994	Ellen	1117	" As she uttered these words Mrs. Jubkins opened a door at the end of the passage , and conducted Ellen into the room where her husband was lying . For a moment the young lady recoiled from the appearance of that large apartment , filled with beds in which there lay pillowed so many ghastly faces ; but this emotion was as evanescent as the most rapid flash of lightning . And now , firm in her purpose to console and solace him whom she had taught herself to love , she followed the nurse towards the bed where the patient lay,—looking neither to the right nor to the left as she proceeded thither . Greenwood 's countenance was very pale ; but the instant the lovely features of his wife burst upon his view , his eyes were lighted up with an expression of joy such as she had never seen them wear before , and the glow of which appeared to penetrate with a sensation of ineffable bliss into the very profundities of her soul . "
1008003	1008025	1007994	1007994	Ellen	1117	" said Greenwood , tears starting on his long silken lashes , as he pressed her hand warmly in his own . "
1008037	1008041	1007994	1007994	Ellen	1117	" whispered Ellen : "
1008071	1008072	1008077	1008077	Ellen	1117	" "
1008079	1008083	1008077	1008077	Ellen	1117	" murmured Greenwood : "
1008097	1008106	1008077	1008077	Ellen	1117	" he added , after a brief pause , "
1008140	1008141	1008119	1008119	I	0	" "
1008151	1008155	1008119	1008119	I	0	" whispered Ellen : "
1008267	1008268	1008269	1008269	Ellen	1117	" "
1008275	1008281	1008269	1008269	Ellen	1117	" said Greenwood , impatiently . "
1008295	1008316	1008318	1008318	you	33938	" answered the beautiful young woman , smiling with a plaintive and melancholy sweetness as she leant over his couch . "
1008434	1008460	1008472	1008472	my	0	" Greenwood made no answer ; but he meditated profoundly upon those loving words and touching assurances that his beauteous wife breathed in his ear . "
1008463	1008467	1008468	1008468	you	33938	" continued Ellen , "
1008593	1008594	1008595	1008595	Ellen	1117	" "
1008597	1008608	1008595	1008595	Ellen	1117	" murmured Greenwood , pressing her hand to his lips , "
1008643	1008909	1008635	1008635	I	0	" Sweet Ellen , thou hast conquered the obduracy of that heart which was so long the abode of selfishness and pride;—thou hast subdued the stubborn soul of that haughty and ambitious man:—thine amiability has triumphed over his worldliness;—and thou hast thy crowning reward in the tears which now moisten his pillow , and in the affectionate glances which are upturned towards thee ! And Ellen departed from the hospital where her angelic influence had wrought so marvellous a change,—departed with a bosom cherishing fond hopes and delicious reveries of happiness to come . In the course of that very day Filippo engaged a house in the northern part of Islington ; and Ellen superintended , with a joyful heart , the preparations that were made during the ensuing week to render the dwelling as comfortable as possible . At length she had the pleasure,—nay , more than pleasure — the ineffable satisfaction of welcoming her husband to that abode which , if not so splendid nor so spacious as the mansion he had once occupied in Spring Gardens , was at least a most grateful change after the cold and cheerless aspect of a hospital . It was about eleven o'clock in the night of the first Saturday of June , that the Resurrection Man — the terrible Anthony Tidkins — issued from the dwelling of Mr. Banks , the undertaker in Globe Lane , Globe Town . Mr. Banks followed him to the threshold , and , ere he bade him good night , said , as he retained him by the sleeve , "
1008923	1008924	1008912	1008912	you	26314	" "
1008933	1008937	1008912	1008912	you	26314	" returned Tidkins . "
1008993	1008994	1008989	1008991	the infernal villain	26316	" "
1008997	1009001	1008989	1008991	the infernal villain	26316	" observed Banks , "
1009039	1009040	1009043	1009043	he	26317	" "
1009060	1009069	1009043	1009043	he	26317	" exclaimed Tidkins , with a savage growl . "
1009138	1009139	1009119	1009119	I	0	" "
1009148	1009152	1009119	1009119	I	0	" said Banks , "
1009203	1009204	1009205	1009205	You	26320	" "
1009219	1009225	1009212	1009217	the old woman in Golden Lane	26325	" whispered Tidkins , impatiently . "
1009248	1009249	1009228	1009228	I	0	" "
1009254	1009259	1009228	1009228	I	0	" said Mr. Banks ; "
1009290	1009291	1009282	1009285	the wicked old creetur	26327	" "
1009302	1009308	1009294	1009294	she	26325	" growled the Resurrection Man . "
1009317	1009323	1009294	1009294	she	26325	" moaned the hypocritical undertaker : "
1009378	1009379	1009385	1009385	you	26320	" "
1009390	1009394	1009381	1009381	your	26320	" muttered Tidkins ; "
1009421	1009422	1009405	1009405	you	26320	" "
1009437	1009443	1009448	1009448	he	26325	" said Banks , earnestly . "
1009456	1009457	1009459	1009459	he	26325	" "
1009461	1009465	1009459	1009459	he	26325	" exclaimed Tidkins . "
1009507	1009508	1009503	1009504	Crankey Jem	873	" "
1009520	1009524	1009525	1009525	you	26320	" said Banks , "
1009537	1009538	1009539	1009539	I	0	" "
1009542	1009595	1009597	1009599	the Resurrection Man	3220	" answered Tidkins , with an abruptness which was in itself expressive of demoniac ferocity . ' You come to me to - morrow morning ; and see if I wo n't invent some scheme that shall put Richard Markham in my power . I tell you what it is , Banks , "
1009608	1009645	1009597	1009599	the Resurrection Man	3220	" I hate that fellow to a degree I can not explain ; and depend upon it , he shall gnash his teeth in one of the dark cells yonder before he 's a week older . "
1009646	1009655	1009657	1009658	the undertaker	32765	" And what good will that do you ? "
1009660	1009664	1009666	1009666	Tidkins	1061	" What good ! "
1009689	1009716	1009677	1009677	he	1061	" We 'll make him pay an immense sum for his ransom — a sum that shall enrich us both , Ned : and then — — "
1009717	1009721	1009723	1009723	Banks	1300	" And then ? "
1009727	1009741	1009743	1009743	Tidkins	1061	" And then — when I 've got all I can from him , "
1009745	1009751	1009743	1009743	Tidkins	1061	" I 'll murder him ! "
1010098	1010113	1010117	1010117	himself	1061	" Well , nothing has been disturbed up here — that 's certain enough , "
1010119	1010128	1010117	1010117	himself	1061	" Now for a survey of the vaults . "
1010330	1010338	1010339	1010339	he	1061	" I think it 's all right , "
1010354	1010403	1010404	1010404	He	1061	" Still the lock might have been picked since I was here last , and another key purposely broken in it to stave off suspicion . At any rate , it is better to examine every nook and corner of the whole place — and so I will ! "
1010495	1010503	1010504	1010504	he	1061	" Yes — it is all right ! "
1010509	1010558	1010504	1010504	he	1061	" no one has been here during my absence . I suppose that villain Jem Cuffin was content with all the gold and jewels he got , and took no farther steps to molest me . But , by Satan ! if ever I clap my eyes on him again!"—and
1010568	1010571	1010572	1010572	he	1061	" Well , "
1010584	1010628	1010629	1010629	he	1061	" it 's a blessing to be able to come back and settle in the old crib ! There 's no place in London like it : the house in Chick Lane is nothing to it . And now that I have returned , "
1010650	1010668	1010670	1010670	he	1061	it,—"one of these deep , cold , cheerless dungeons shall soon become the abode of Richard Markham ! "
1010773	1010819	1010763	1010763	he	1061	" Ah ! this must be the cell ! It 's the one , as I have been told , where so many maniacs dashed their brains out against the wall , when this place was used as an asylum — long before my time . "
1010848	1010853	1010854	1010854	he	1061	" Yes — yes ! "
1010859	1010926	1010854	1010854	he	1061	" this is the one for Richard Markham ! All that he has ever done to me shall soon be fearfully visited on his own head ! Ah , ah ! we shall see whether his high rank — his boasted virtues — his immense influence — and his glorious name can mitigate one pang of all the sufferings that he must here endure ! Yes , "
1010936	1010944	1010934	1010934	his	1061	countenance,—"this is the dungeon for Richard Markham ! "
1010945	1010952	1010928	1010928	Tidkins	1061	" No — it is thine ! "
1011049	1011059	1011065	1011065	he	873	" The hour of vengeance is come at last ! "
1011080	1011121	1011065	1011065	he	873	" There shall you remain , Tidkins — to perish by starvation — to die by inches — to feel the approach of Death by means of such slow tortures that you will curse the day which saw your birth ! "
1011122	1011131	1011133	1011135	the Resurrection Man	952	" Jem , do not say all that ! "
1011144	1011162	1011133	1011135	the Resurrection Man	952	" You would not be so cruel ? Let me out — and we will be friends . "
1011163	1011166	1011168	1011168	Cuffin	873	" Never ! "
1011170	1011214	1011168	1011168	Cuffin	873	" What ! have I hunted after you — dogged you — watched you — then lost sight of you for two years — now found you out again — at length got you into my power — and all this for nothing ? "
1011215	1011228	1011230	1011232	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Well , Jem — I know that I used you badly , "
1011239	1011269	1011230	1011232	the Resurrection Man	3220	" but forgive me — pray forgive me ! Surely you were sufficiently avenged by plundering me of my treasure — my hoarded gold — my casket of jewels ? "
1011270	1011274	1011276	1011277	Crankey Jem	873	" Miserable wretch ! "
1011286	1011355	1011276	1011277	Crankey Jem	873	" do not imagine that I took your gold and your jewels to enrich myself . No : had I been starving , I would not have purchased a morsel of bread by means of their aid ! Two hours after I had become possessed of your treasure , I consigned it all — yes , all — gold and jewels — to the bed of the Thames ! "
1011356	1011364	1011366	1011366	Tidkins	1061	" Then are you not sufficiently avenged ? "
1011383	1011396	1011398	1011399	Crankey Jem	873	" Your death , amidst lingering tortures , will alone satisfy me ! "
1011401	1011429	1011398	1011399	Crankey Jem	873	" Monster that you are , you shall meet the fate which you had reserved for an excellent nobleman whose virtues are as numerous as your crimes ! "
1011430	1011441	1011443	1011443	Tidkins	1061	" What good will my death do you , Jem ? "
1011461	1011474	1011476	1011477	James Cuffin	873	" What good would the death of Richard Markham have done you ? "
1011479	1011814	1011476	1011477	James Cuffin	873	" Ah ! you can not answer that question ! Of what advantage is your cunning now ? But listen to me , while I tell you how I have succeeded in over - reaching you at last . One night — more than two years ago — I was watching for you in the street . I had found out your den — and I was waiting your return , to plunge my dagger into your breast . But when you did come home that night , you was not alone . Another man was with you ; and a woman , blindfolded , was being dragged between you up the alley . I watched — you and the man soon afterwards re - appeared ; but the woman was not with you . Then I knew that she was a prisoner , or had been murdered ; and I thought that if I could place you in the hands of justice , with the certainty of sending you to the scaffold , my revenge would be more complete . But my plan was spoilt by the silly affair of young Holford ; for I was locked up in prison on account of that business . But I got my liberty at last ; and that very same night I returned to this house . I knew that you had been arrested and was in Coldbath Fields ; and so I resolved to examine the entire premises . By means of skeleton keys I obtained an easy entrance into the lower part of the house ; and , after a little careful search , I discovered the secret of the trap - door . I visited the cells ; but the woman was not in any of them . And now you know how I came to discover the mysteries of your den , Tidkins ; and you can guess how at another visit I found the hiding - place of your treasure . "
1011815	1011821	1011823	1011825	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Jem , one word ! "
1011835	1011855	1011823	1011825	the Resurrection Man	3220	" You have got me in your power — do you mean to put your dreadful threat into execution ? "
1011856	1011866	1011868	1011869	the avenger	14075	" No persuasion on earth can change my mind ! "
1011876	1011887	1011868	1011869	the avenger	14075	" Hark ! this is a proof of my determination ! "
1011929	1011932	1011934	1011936	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Devil ! "
1012095	1012105	1012107	1012108	the avenger	14075	" Now you can understand that I am determined ! "
1012110	1012158	1012107	1012108	the avenger	14075	" And here shall I remain until all is over with you , Tidkins . No ! I shall now and then steal out for short intervals at a time , to procure food — food to sustain me , while you are starving in your coffin ! "
1012159	1012163	1012165	1012165	Tidkins	1061	" Infernal wretch ! "
1012167	1012215	1012165	1012165	Tidkins	1061	" you are mistaken ! I will not die by starvation , if die I must . I have matches with me — and in a moment I can blow the entire house — aye , and half the street along with it — into the air ! "
1012216	1012225	1012227	1012228	Crankey Jem	873	" You will not frighten me , Tidkins , "
1012237	1012240	1012242	1012244	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Damnation ! "
1012258	1012274	1012275	1012276	Crankey Jem	873	" will neither prayers nor threats move you ? Then must I do my worst ! "
1012407	1012414	1012415	1012415	he	3220	" My eyes ! my eyes ! "
1012426	1012434	1012415	1012415	he	3220	" O God ! I am blinded ! "
1012435	1012447	1012449	1012450	Crankey Jem	873	" Sight would be of no use in that dark dungeon , "
1012461	1012474	1012477	1012479	the Resurrection Man	3220	" Are you not satisfied now , demon — devil — fiend ! "
1012481	1012491	1012477	1012479	the Resurrection Man	3220	" The powder has blinded me , I say ! "
1012492	1012502	1012504	1012505	the avenger	14075	" It was damp , and only exploded partially , "
1012507	1012511	1012504	1012505	the avenger	14075	" Try again ! "
1012512	1012515	1012517	1012517	Tidkins	1061	" Wretch ! "
1012896	1012933	1012892	1012893	the postman	32906	" Your mortal enemy , my lord , is no more . My vengeance has overtaken him at last . Anthony Tidkins has died a horrible death:—had he lived , you would have become his victim . "
1012937	1013386	1012892	1012893	the postman	32906	" It was the 10th of July , 1843 . The bell upon the roof of Markham Place had just proclaimed the hour of nine , and the morning was as bright and beautiful as the cheerful sun , the cloudless sky , and the gentle breeze could render a summer - day,—when a party of eight persons ascended the hill on which stood the two trees . Those emblems of the fraternal affection of early years were green , verdant , and flourishing ; and on the one which had been planted by the hands of the long - lost brother , were the following inscriptions : — Eugene . Dec. 25 , 1836 . Eugene . May 17th , 1838 . Eugene . March 6 , 1841 . Eugene . July 1st , 1843 . This last inscription , as the reader will perceive , had only been very recently added ; and Richard regarded it as a promise — a pledge — a solemn sign that the appointment would be kept . It was nine o'clock in the evening when the parting between the brothers took place in the year 1831 ; and , although it was impossible to determine at what hour of the day on which the twelve years expired , Eugene would return , nevertheless Richard , judging by his own anxiety to clasp a brother in his arms , felt certain that this brother would not delay the moment that was to re - unite them . Accordingly , at nine o'clock on the morning of the 10th of July , 1843 , the Prince , repaired to the eminence on which he hoped — oh ! how fondly hoped — full soon to welcome the long - lost Eugene . His seven companions were the Princess Isabella , Ellen , Mr. Monroe , Katherine , Mario Bazzano , Eliza Sydney , and the faithful Whittingham . Richard could not conceal a certain nervous suspense under which he laboured ; for although he felt assured of Eugene 's appearance , yet so long a period had elapsed since they had parted , and so many vicissitudes might have occurred during the interval , that he trembled lest the meeting should be characterised by circumstances which would give his brother pain . The Princess Isabella , naturally anxious to become acquainted with her brother - in - law , also looked forward to the return of the long - lost one with emotions which enabled her to comprehend those that animated her husband ; and pressing his hand tenderly as they seated themselves on the bench between the trees , she whispered , "
1013410	1013698	1013699	1013699	I	0	" On her side , Katherine was the prey to various conflicting feelings,—anxiety to know a brother whom she had as yet never seen — fear lest he should not come — and curiosity to be convinced whether he were as amiable , as generous - hearted , and as deserving of her sisterly love as Richard . And Ellen — poor Ellen!—how difficult for her was the task of concealing all the emotions which agitated her bosom now ! But she nevertheless derived much encouragement and hope from the frequent looks of profound meaning which were directed towards her by Eliza Sydney . Bazzano endeavoured to soothe the anxiety of his beloved Katherine ; while Mr. Monroe and Whittingham shared to a considerable degree the suspense which now animated them all . It was about a quarter past nine o'clock , when Mr. Greenwood halted by the road - side , at a spot which commanded a view of the hill - top whereon stood the two trees . He was on foot ; and though he had so far recovered from his recent accident as to exhibit only a very trifling lameness in his gait , still the short walk which he had taken from Islington to the immediate vicinity of Markham Place , compelled him to pause and rest by the way - side . He looked towards the hill , and could plainly distinguish the number of persons who were stationed on that eminence . A deadly pallor overspread his countenance ; and tears started from his eyes . But in a few moments he exercised a violent effort over his emotions , and exclaimed aloud , with a kind of desperate emphasis , "
1013722	1013735	1013736	1013736	you	1117	" he added , his voice suddenly changing to a plaintive tone , "
1013758	1013859	1013744	1013744	you	1117	" This apostrophe to his wife seemed to arouse all the better feelings of his soul ; and without farther hesitation , he pursued his way towards the hill . In a few minutes he reached a point where the road took a sudden turn to the right , thus running round all one side of the base of the eminence , and passing by the mansion itself . There he paused again;—for although the party assembled on the hill were plainly perceived by him , he was yet unseen by them — a hedge concealing him from their view . "
1013871	1013884	1013744	1013744	you	1117	" he exclaimed , with a temporary revival of bitterness of spirit . "
1013910	1013949	1013950	1013950	She	26417	" At that instant he caught sight of the figure of his wife , who , having advanced a few paces in front of her companions , stood more conspicuously than they upon the brow of the hill . "
1013956	1013962	1013950	1013950	She	26417	" he murmured to himself . "
1013970	1014026	1013950	1013950	She	26417	" And , as he spoke , he was about to emerge from the shade of the high hedge which concealed him,—about to turn the angle of the road , whereby he would immediately be perceived by those who stood on the hill,—when his attention was suddenly called elsewhere . For , no sooner had the words—"Oh
1014033	1014203	1014204	1014204	Villain	3446	" issued from his lips , than a post - chaise , which was dashing along the road towards London at a rapid rate , upset only a few paces from the spot where he had paused to glance towards the hill . One of the fore - wheels of the vehicle had come off ; and the chaise rolled over with a heavy crash . The postillion instantly stopped his horses ; while a man — the only traveller whom the vehicle contained — emerged from the door that was uppermost , and which he had contrived to open . All this occurred so rapidly that the traveller stood in the road a few instants after the upsetting of the chaise . Greenwood drew near to inquire if he were hurt : but , scarcely had his eyes caught a glimpse of that man 's features , when he uttered a cry of mingled rage and delight , and sprang towards him . For that traveller was Lafleur ! "
1014206	1014219	1014221	1014221	you	26419	" cried Greenwood , seizing hold of the Frenchman by the collar : "
1014239	1014240	1014234	1014234	you	26419	" "
1014244	1014251	1014234	1014234	you	26419	" exclaimed the ex - valet ; "
1014258	1014259	1014260	1014260	Wretch	1062	" "
1014262	1014266	1014234	1014234	you	26419	" interrupted Greenwood : "
1014274	1014510	1014270	1014270	me	0	" Lafleur gnashed his teeth with rage , and endeavoured to shake off his assailant with a sudden and desperate effort to hurl him to the ground . But Greenwood , weakened though he was by illness , maintained his hold upon the Frenchman , and called for assistance . The postillion knew not whose part to take , and therefore remained neutral . Lafleur 's situation was most critical ; but he was not the man to yield without a desperate attempt to free himself . Suddenly taking a pistol from his pocket , he aimed a furious blow , with the butt - end of the weapon , at the head of Greenwood , whose hat had fallen off in the struggle . The blow descended with tremendous force : and in the next moment Greenwood lay senseless on the road , while Lafleur darted away from the spot with the speed of lightning . For an instant the postillion hesitated whether to pursue the fugitive or attend to the wounded man ; but he almost immediately decided in favour of the more humane course . Upon examination he found that Greenwood 's forehead had received a terrible wound , from which the blood was streaming down his temples . He was moreover quite senseless ; and the postillion , after binding the wound with a handkerchief , vainly endeavoured to recover him . "
1014527	1014696	1014697	1014697	My	0	" said the man to himself ; and , after an instant 's reflection , he remembered that Markham Place was close at hand . Depositing Greenwood as comfortably as he could on the cushions which he took from the chaise , he hastened to the mansion , and related to the servants all that had occurred . Without a moment 's hesitation,—well knowing that their conduct would be approved of by their excellent master,—three stout footmen hastened , with the means of forming a litter , to the spot where the postillion had left Greenwood . On their arrival they found that he had to some extent recovered his senses ; and a cordial , which one of the footmen poured down his throat , completely revived him . But , alas ! he was aroused only to the fearful conviction that he had received his death - blow ; for that mysterious influence which sometimes warns the soul of its approaching flight , was upon him ! "
1014701	1014712	1014697	1014697	My	0	" he said , in a faint and languid tone , "
1014727	1014728	1014745	1014745	you	26649	" "
1014734	1014740	1014732	1014732	sir	26649	" returned the senior footman ; "
1014748	1014749	1014750	1014750	I	0	" "
1014756	1014768	1014750	1014750	I	0	" exclaimed Greenwood , speaking with more strength and animation than at first,—"I
1014821	1014964	1014814	1014815	the Prince	6244	" The servants were well aware of the motive which had induced their master and his companions to repair to the hill - top thus early on this particular day ; and the urgent request of Greenwood now excited a sudden suspicion in their minds . But they did not express their thoughts : there was no time to waste in question or comment — for the wounded gentleman , who had proffered so earnest a prayer , was evidently in a dying state . Exchanging significant glances , the servants placed Greenwood upon the litter ; and , aided by the postillion , set out with their burden towards the hill . The angle of the road was passed ; and the party bearing the wounded man , suddenly appeared to the view of those who were stationed on the hill . "
1014968	1014976	1014814	1014815	the Prince	6244	" exclaimed Richard , with a shudder : "
1014982	1014983	1014814	1014815	the Prince	6244	" "
1014988	1014992	1014814	1014815	the Prince	6244	" said Ellen : "
1015012	1015013	1015002	1015004	some poor creature	26428	" "
1015028	1015038	1015039	1015040	A man	2001	" cried the Prince , now becoming painfully excited . "
1015063	1015293	1015297	1015298	sweet Isabella	1329	" And as he uttered these words , Richard sank back almost fainting upon the seat . The gallant warrior , whose heart had never failed in the thickest of the battle — whose courage was so dauntless when bullets were flying round him like hail — and whose valour had given him a name amongst the mightiest generals of the universe,—this man of a chivalrous soul was subdued by the agonising alarm that had suddenly menaced all his fond fraternal hopes with annihilation ! For so ominous — so sinister appeared to be the approach of a litter at the very moment when he was anxiously awaiting the presence of a long - lost brother , that his feelings experienced a revulsion as painful as it was sudden . And now for a few moments the strange spectacle of the litter was forgotten by those who crowded round our hero in alarm at the change which had come over him . Even Ellen turned away from the contemplation of that mournful procession which was toiling up the hill;—for she had seen Greenwood on the preceding evening — she had left him in good health — she had raised his spirits by her kind attentions and her loving language — and she did not for one moment apprehend that he could be the almost lifeless occupant of that litter ! "
1015314	1015326	1015307	1015307	you	26432	" said Richard , at the expiration of a few minutes : "
1015354	1015355	1015345	1015345	I	0	" "
1015358	1015364	1015369	1015369	Richard	874	" repeated Isabella , tenderly : "
1015428	1015429	1015430	1015430	You	874	" "
1015439	1015456	1015430	1015430	You	874	" said Markham , pressing with the tenderest warmth the hand of his lovely young wife . "
1015465	1015475	1015458	1015458	I	0	" answered the Princess , with a sweet smile . "
1015487	1015491	1015477	1015477	us	26435	" said Katherine . "
1015502	1015503	1015477	1015477	us	26435	" "
1015513	1015556	1015507	1015508	the servants	2611	" asked Richard . This question produced a startling effect upon all who heard it : and no wonder that it did so — for the consideration which it involved had escaped all attention during the excitement of the last few minutes . "
1015567	1015574	1015507	1015508	the servants	2611	" whispered Ellen to Eliza Sydney . "
1015582	1015698	1015699	1015699	Eugene	879	" At that moment the litter had approached so near the brow of the hill , that as Ellen glanced towards it while she spoke , her eyes obtained a full view of the countenance of him who lay stretched upon that mournful couch . A piercing shriek burst from her lips ; and she fell back , as if suddenly shot through the heart , into the arms of Eliza Sydney . Richard sprang forward : a few steps brought him close by the litter , which the bearers now placed upon the ground beneath the foliage of the very tree whereon the inscriptions were engraved ! One look — one look was sufficient ! "
1015705	1015742	1015703	1015703	Eugene	879	" exclaimed our hero , in a tone of the most intense anguish , as he cast himself on his knees by the side of the litter , and threw his arms around the dying man . "
1015796	1015797	1015798	1015798	Your	26444	" "
1015803	1015822	1015798	1015798	Your	26444	" cried Isabella , scarcely knowing what she said in that moment of intense excitement and profound astonishment : "
1015852	1015853	1015854	1015854	Montague	903	" "
1015858	1015875	1015856	1015856	Greenwood	903	" ejaculated Richard , starting as if an ice - bolt had suddenly entered his heart . "
1015905	1015906	1015909	1015909	Richard	874	" "
1015916	1015932	1015913	1015914	that villain	29649	" answered Eugene , turning his dying countenance in an imploring manner towards his brother . "
1015951	1015952	1015913	1015914	that villain	29649	" "
1015957	1015972	1015913	1015914	that villain	29649	" cried the Prince , again embracing Eugene with passionate — almost frantic warmth . "
1016033	1016034	1016025	1016025	Eugene	879	" "
1016046	1016050	1016044	1016044	Richard	874	" said Eugene . "
1016090	1016091	1016067	1016067	you	1864	" "
1016100	1016121	1016098	1016098	Eugene	879	" cried Kate , also falling on her knees by the side of her brother , and embracing him tenderly . "
1016137	1016147	1016149	1016149	you	1864	" continued Eugene , extending his hand towards her : "
1016162	1016163	1016149	1016149	you	1864	" "
1016179	1016190	1016177	1016177	Eugene	879	" answered the Princess , tears trickling down her countenance . "
1016213	1016214	1016203	1016203	your	879	" "
1016224	1016228	1016203	1016203	your	879	" murmured Eugene . "
1016239	1016263	1016264	1016264	Your	0	" exclaimed Ellen , who , having regained her consciousness through the kind attentions of Eliza Sydney , now flew to the litter . "
1016269	1016283	1016267	1016267	Ellen	1117	" cried Mr. Monroe and Richard as it were in the same breath . "
1016299	1016303	1016286	1016286	Eugene	879	" ejaculated Ellen : "
1016323	1016324	1016306	1016306	you	879	" "
1016331	1016350	1016306	1016306	you	879	" said Eugene , a transient fire animating his eyes , as he clasped Ellen in his arms , "
1016412	1016413	1016414	1016414	We	26473	" "
1016424	1016438	1016414	1016414	We	26473	" said his wife , bending over the litter with the tenderest solicitude ; "
1016447	1016448	1016414	1016414	We	26473	" "
1016457	1016462	1016414	1016414	We	26473	" exclaimed her husband : "
1016500	1016501	1016507	1016507	you	0	" "
1016513	1016534	1016507	1016507	you	0	" said Eliza Sydney , approaching the couch , and extending her hand to Eugene , who wrung it cordially . "
1016537	1016550	1016507	1016507	you	0	" added Eliza , perceiving that he was about to address her : "
1016569	1016570	1016571	1016572	Admirable woman	26482	" "
1016574	1016613	1016571	1016572	Admirable woman	26482	" cried Eugene , overpowered by so many manifestations of forgiveness , affection , and sympathy as he had received within the last few minutes . Mario Bazzano was then presented to his brother - in - law . "
1016623	1016632	1016615	1016615	God	1815	" said Eugene , in a solemn tone . "
1016757	1016758	1016759	1016759	Your	0	" "
1016763	1016767	1016759	1016759	Your	0	" shrieked Ellen : "
1016776	1016777	1016759	1016759	Your	0	" "
1016788	1016798	1016786	1016786	Eugene	879	" said Richard , his eyes dimmed with tears , "
1016806	1016908	1016786	1016786	Eugene	879	" Katherine and Isabella also wept abundantly . A servant had already departed to fetch a surgeon : a second was now despatched to the house for the little Richard and the young Prince Alberto . It was at length Whittingham 's turn to go forward ; and , whimpering like a child , he pressed Eugene 's hand warmly in his own . The old man was unable to speak — his voice was choked with emotion ; but Eugene recognised him , and acknowledged his faithful attachment with a few kind words which only increased the butler 's grief . "
1016925	1016934	1016917	1016919	my dearest relatives	26491	" said Eugene , after a brief pause . "
1017375	1017376	1017366	1017366	I	0	" "
1017386	1017390	1017366	1017366	I	0	" exclaimed Richard . "
1017431	1017491	1017492	1017492	God	1815	" Eugene raised himself , by Ellen 's aid , upon the litter , and embraced the two children with the most unfeigned tenderness . For a few moments he gazed earnestly upon their innocent countenances : then , yielding to a sudden impulse , as the incidents of his own career swept through his memory , he exclaimed , "
1017507	1017524	1017505	1017505	I	0	" Richard and Ellen implored him not to give way to bitter reflections for the past . "
1017539	1017543	1017544	1017544	My	0	" murmured Eugene . "
1017579	1017580	1017581	1017581	He	26511	" "
1017591	1017596	1017585	1017585	he	26511	" exclaimed the Prince . "
1017620	1017621	1017610	1017610	he	26511	" "
1017631	1017654	1017597	1017597	Ellen	1117	" added Richard . Then , drawing forth the document , he broke the seal . A letter fell upon the ground . "
1017658	1017662	1017597	1017597	Ellen	1117	" said Eugene : "
1017673	1017696	1017697	1017697	I	0	" The Prince complied with his brother 's request , and read the letter aloud . Its contents were as follow : — "
1017732	1017750	1017597	1017597	Ellen	1117	" Richard , you will become a great man — as you are now a good one . "
1017842	1017922	1017927	1017930	my dear young friend	29196	" Signor Viviani , banker at Pinalla , in the State of Castelcicala , or his agents , Messrs. Glyn and Co. , bankers , London , will pay over to you , on presentation of this letter , the sum of seventy - five thousand pounds , with all interest , simple and compound , accruing thereto since the month of July , 1839 , at which period I placed that amount in the hands of Signor Viviani . "
1017986	1017998	1017999	1018000	THOMAS ARMSTRONG	882	" Be happy , my dear young friend — be happy ! "
1018002	1018026	1017999	1018000	THOMAS ARMSTRONG	882	" It would be impossible to describe the emotions awakened in the breast of all those who heard the contents of this letter . "
1018033	1018042	1017999	1018000	THOMAS ARMSTRONG	882	" exclaimed Richard , after a brief pause , "
1018061	1018062	1018056	1018056	you	0	" "
1018086	1018106	1018084	1018084	Richard	874	" continued Eugene , in a voice tremulous with emotions and faint with the ebb of life 's spirit , "
1018171	1018172	1018167	1018169	a ruined profligate	26522	" "
1018177	1018182	1018167	1018169	a ruined profligate	26522	" exclaimed the Prince ; "
1018193	1018198	1018183	1018183	you	0	" Eugene smiled faintly . "
1018206	1018306	1018307	1018308	My husband	27376	" ejaculated Ellen . And it was so ! Terrible was the anguish of those by whom he was surrounded . Mr. Wentworth , the surgeon , appeared at this crisis ; but his attentions were ministered in vain . Eugene 's eyes grew dim — still he continued sensible ; and he knew that his last moments were approaching . Richard — Ellen — Katherine — Eliza Sydney — the two children — Mario Bazzano — Isabella — Mr. Monroe — and the faithful Whittingham — all wept bitterly , as the surgeon shook his head in despair ! "
1018314	1018320	1018307	1018308	My husband	27376	" screamed Ellen , wildly : "
1018345	1019395	1018307	1018308	My husband	27376	" Eugene essayed to speak — but could not : and that was his last mortal effort . In another moment his spirit had fled for ever ! Lafleur was captured , tried , and condemned to transportation for life , for the manslaughter of Eugene Markham . Immediately after the trial the Prince and Princess of Montoni , with the infant Prince Alberto , and accompanied by Signor and Signora Bazzano , embarked for Castelcicala in the Torione steam - frigate which was sent to convey them thither . We need scarcely say that the faithful Whittingham was in our hero 's suite . Eliza Sydney continues to reside at her beautiful villa near Upper Clapton ; and her charitable disposition , her amiable manners , and her exemplary mode of life render her the admiration and pride of the entire neighbourhood . The Earl of Warrington and Diana dwell in comparative seclusion , but in perfect happiness , and have never once regretted the day when they accompanied each other to the altar . King Zingary departed this life about six months ago ; and Morcar is now the sovereign of the Gipsy tribe in these realms . He has already begun strenuously to exert himself in the improvement of the moral character of his people ; and though he finds the materials on which he labours to make an impression somewhat stubborn , he has declared his intention of persevering in his good work . His wife Eva constantly wears round her neck the gold chain which Isabella sent her ; and night and morning the son of these good people is taught to kneel down and pray for the continued prosperity and happiness of the Prince and Princess of Montoni . Pocock has remained an honest , industrious , and worthy man . He has now a good establishment in one of the most business - streets of the City , employs many hands , and has purchased some nice little freehold property in the neighbourhood of Holloway — in order , as he says , that he may have an occasional excuse for taking a walk round the mansion which bears the name of him whom he extols as his saviour — his benefactor ! And that mansion — to whom does it now belong ? It is the property of Mr. Monroe , and will become Ellen 's at his death : but the old man is still strong and hearty ; and every fine afternoon he may be seen walking through the grounds , leaning upon the arm of his daughter or of Eliza Sydney , who is a frequent visitor at the Place . Ellen is beautiful as ever , and might doubtless marry well , did she choose to seek society : but she has vowed to remain single for the sake of her child , who is now a blooming boy , and whom she rears with the fond hope that he will prove worthy of the name that he bears — the name of his uncle , Richard Markham . Skilligalee and the Rattlesnake , long since united in matrimonial bonds , are leading a comfortable and steady life in Hoxton , the business of their little shop producing them not only a sufficiency for the present , but also the wherewith to create a provision for their old age . Crankey Jem called upon them on the evening following the death of the Resurrection Man , and acquainted them with the event . From that moment nothing positive has ever been heard of James Cuffin ; but it is supposed that he embarked as a common sailor in some ship bound for a long voyage . Henry Holford remains a prisoner in Bethlem Hospital . He is in the full and unimpaired possession of his intellects , but has often and bitterly cursed the day when he listened to the whispering voice of his morbid ambition . Albert Egerton has already become a wealthy merchant , possessing an establishment at Montoni and one in London ; and , when sojourning at the former , he receives frequent invitations to dine at the Palace . Lord Dunstable has retrieved the errors of his earlier years by an unwearied course of honourable and upright conduct , steadfastly pursued from the moment when he declared himself to have been touched by the words of the Prince of Montoni on the occasion of the exposure in Stratton Street . Colonel Cholmondeley , Sir Rupert Harborough , and Mr. Chichester are undergoing a sentence of ten years ' condemnation to the galleys at Brest , for having attempted to pass forged Bank of England notes at a money - changer 's shop in Paris . Major Anderson continues to live honourably and comfortably upon a pension allowed him by the Prince . Mrs. Chichester removed about two years ago to a pleasant cottage in Wales , where she dwells in the tranquil seclusion suitable to her taste . Filippo Dorsenni has opened an extensive hotel for foreigners at the West End of the town , and is happy in the prosperity of his business . Lady Bounce was compelled to sue for a separate maintenance about eighteen months ago , on the ground of cruelty and ill - treatment ; and in this suit she succeeded . Sir Cherry and Major Dapper continue as intimate as ever , and pursue pretty well the same unprofitable career as we have hitherto seen them following . Mr. Banks , the undertaker of Globe Lane , carried his economic principles to such an extent that he fell into the habit of purchasing cloth to cover his coffins at a rate which certainly defied competition ; but a quantity of that material having been missed from a warehouse in the City and traced to his establishment , he was compelled , although much against his inclination , to accompany an officer to Worship Street , where the porter belonging to the aforesaid warehouse was already in the dock on a charge of stealing the lost property . Vain was it that Mr. Banks endeavoured to impress upon the magistrate 's mind the fact that he was as "
1019411	1020046	1020049	1020049	you	26527	" the case was referred to the learned Recorder at the Old Bailey for farther investigation ; and one fine morning Mr. Banks found himself sentenced to two years ' imprisonment in the Compter for receiving goods knowing them to have been stolen . Concerning Tomlinson and old Michael Martin , we have been unable to glean any tidings : but in respect to Robert Stephens , we have reason to believe that he manages to obtain a livelihood , under a feigned name , in a counting - house at New York . John Smithers , better known to our readers as Gibbet , is the wealthiest inhabitant of a new town that has risen within these last three years in the valley of the Ohio ; and in a recent letter to the Prince of Montoni he declares that he is happier than he ever thought he could become . ' Tis done : Virtue is rewarded — Vice has received its punishment . Said we not , in the very opening of this work , that from London branched off two roads , leading to two points totally distinct the one from the other ? Have we not shown how the one winds its tortuous way through all the noisome dens of crime , chicanery , dissipation , and voluptuousness ; and how the other meanders amidst rugged rocks and wearisome acclivities , but having on its way - side the resting - places of rectitude and virtue ? The youths who set out along those roads,—the elder pursuing the former path , the younger the latter,—have fulfilled the destinies to which their separate ways conducted them . The one sleeps in an early grave : the other is the heir - apparent to a throne . Yes : and the prophetic words of the hapless Mary - Anne are fulfilled to the letter ; for now in their palace at Montoni , do the hero and heroine of our tale , while retrospecting over all they have seen and all they have passed through , devote many a kind regret to the memory of the departed girl who predicted for them all the happiness which they enjoy ! And that happiness — the world has seen no felicity more perfect . Adored by a tender wife,—honoured by her parents , on whose brows his valour placed the diadems which they wear,—and almost worshipped by a grateful nation whom his prowess redeemed from slavery,—Richard Markham knows not a single care . On her side,—wedded to him to whom her young heart gave its virgin love,—proud of a husband whose virtues in peace and whose glory in war have shed undying lustre on the name which he bears,—blessed , too , with a lovely boy , whose mind already develops the reflections of his father 's splendid qualities , and with a charming girl , who promises to be the heiress of the mother 's beauty,—can Isabella be otherwise than happy ? Kind Reader , who have borne with me so long — one word to thee . If amongst the circle of thy friends , there be any who express an aversion to peruse this work,—fearful from its title or from fugitive report that the mind will be shocked more than it can be improved , or the blush of shame excited on the cheek oftener than the tear of sympathy will be drawn from the eye;—if , in a word , a false fastidiousness should prejudge , from its own supposition or from misrepresentations made to it by others , a book by means of which we have sought to convey many an useful moral and lash many a flagrant abuse,—do you , kind reader , oppose that prejudice , and exclaim—"Peruse
1020052	1020127	1020049	1020049	you	26527	" For if , on the one side , we have raked amidst the filth and loathsomeness of society,—have we not , on the other , devoted adequate attention to its bright and glorious phases ? In exposing the hideous deformity of vice , have we not studied to develope the witching beauty of virtue ? Have we not taught , in fine , how the example and the philanthropy of one good man can "
1020146	1020243	1020049	1020049	you	26527	" If , then , the preceding pages be calculated to engender one useful thought — awaken one beneficial sentiment,—the work is not without its value . If there be any merit in honesty of purpose and integrity of aim,—then is that merit ours . And if , in addition to considerations of this nature , we may presume that so long as we are enabled to afford entertainment , our labours will be rewarded by the approval of the immense audience to whom we address ourselves,—we may with confidence invite attention to a Second Series of "
