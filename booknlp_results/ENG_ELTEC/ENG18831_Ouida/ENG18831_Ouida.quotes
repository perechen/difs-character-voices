16657	16739	16646	16646	he	868	” asked Zarâ . He laughed , and drew his knife against own brown throat in a significant gesture . Zarâ said no word to him , but she went away with the child under some branches , on which was hung a tattered piece of awning , orange striped , that marked her own especial resting place . Out of the group about the fire , one man , rising , advanced , and looked Taric full in the eyes . “
16748	16772	16646	16646	he	868	” Taric , who never let any living soul molest or menace him , answered without offence , and with a savage candour . “
16825	16840	16841	16841	Taric	124	“ You loved her , and you will let the wolves eat her body ? ”
16844	16863	16841	16841	Taric	124	“ There are few wolves in the Liébana . Go and bury her if you choose , Phratos . ”

18423	18436	18437	18437	he	121	“ The poor fool ’s prayer to the brute that she hated ! ”
18638	18645	18647	18647	Phratos	121	“ She must have been beautiful ? ”
18658	18669	18647	18647	Phratos	121	“ and you care no more for her than that . ”
18687	18714	18684	18684	his	124	“ There will be as good grapes on the vines next year as any we gathered this . What does it signify?—she was only a woman . “
18801	18848	18849	18849	She	117	“ I met her in the wood one summer night . The sun was setting . I do not know why I cared for her — I did . She was like a tall white lily ; these women of ours are only great tawny sunflowers . “
18964	19032	18954	18954	I	0	“ But after a bit she pined , and grew dull again , and wept in secret , and at times I caught her praying to the white cross which she wore on her breast . That made me mad . I cursed her and beat her . She never said anything ; she seemed only to love me more , and that made me more mad . “
19132	19232	19122	19122	I	0	“ But she never said a rough word , you know , and that makes a man mad . Maddalena or Kara or Rachel — any of them,—would have flown and struck a knife at me , and hissed like a snake , and there would have been blows and furious words and bloodshed ; and then we should have kissed , and been lovers again , fast and fierce . But a woman who is quiet , and only looks at you with great , sad , soft eyes , when you strike her,—what is one to do ? “
19322	19517	19518	19518	His	968	“ At last I heard of you in the Liébana , from a tribe we fell in with on the other side of the mountains , and so we travelled her on foot . I thought she would have got to the women before her hour arrived . But she fell down there , and could not stir ; and so the end came . It is best as it is . She was wretched , and what could I do with a woman like that , who would never hearken to another lover , nor give up her dead God on his cross , nor take so much as a broken crust if it were stolen , nor even show her beauty to a sculptor to be carved in stone — for I tried to make her do that , and she would not . It is best as it is . If she had lived we could have done nothing with her . And yet I see her sometimes as I saw her that night , so white and so calm , in the little green wood , as the sun set — ”
19611	19616	19617	19617	he	121	“ The child lives ? ”
19648	19655	19656	19656	he	968	“ Let it go to hell , ”
19723	19729	19730	19730	he	121	“ The child lives still ? ”
19738	19747	19748	19748	he	121	“ You will try and keep it alive ? ”
19756	19769	19751	19751	She	126	“ What is the use ? Taric would rather it were dead . ”
19770	19836	19850	19850	her	126	“ What matter what Taric wishes . Living or dead , it will not hinder him . A child more or less with us , what is it ? Only a draught of goat ’s milk or a handful of meal . So little ; it can not be felt . You have a child of your own , Zarâ : you cared for it ? ”
19837	19840	19841	19841	she	126	“ Yes , ”
19880	19889	19891	19891	Phratos	121	“ Then have pity on the motherless creature , ”
19895	20021	19891	19891	Phratos	121	“ I buried that dead woman ; and her eyes , though there was no sight in them , still seemed to pray to mine — and to pray for her child . Be merciful , Zarâ . Let the child have the warmth of your arms and the defence of your strength . Be merciful , Zarâ ; and your seed shall multiply and increase tenfold , and shall be stately and strong , and shall spread as the branches of the plane‐trees , on which the storm spends its fury in vain , and beneath which all things of the earth can find refuge . For never was a woman ’ pity fruitless , nor the fair deeds of her days without recompense . ”
20069	20078	20079	20079	she	126	“ You are always a fool , Phratos , ”
20082	20091	20079	20079	she	126	“ but it shall be as you fancy . ”
20135	20156	20157	20157	she	126	“ It is a little cub , not worth the saving ; and its dam was not of our people , ”
20174	20188	20189	20189	she	126	“ It is for you , my angel , that I do it , ”
20270	20292	20293	20293	she	126	“ Why should he play for this little stray thing , when he never played once for you , my glory ? ”
22176	22181	22182	22182	he	124	“ Which is mine ? ”
22243	22248	22249	22249	he	124	“ Can she dance ? ”
22255	22266	22249	22249	he	124	“ In her own fashion,—as a flower in the wind , ”
22541	22546	22547	22547	he	124	“ She will do , ”
22550	22560	22547	22547	he	124	“ What is it you mean with the child ? ”
22568	22581	22582	22582	he	124	“ The little vermin is good for a gold piece or two , ”
22698	22704	22705	22705	she	1076	“ You signed to me , ”
22714	22721	22705	22705	she	1076	“ You want the child killed ? ”
22731	22740	22705	22705	she	1076	“ Not I ; what should I gain ? ”
22741	22753	22705	22705	she	1076	“ What is it you want , then , with her ? ”
22754	23004	22705	22705	she	1076	“ I mean to take her , that is all.—See here — a month ago , on the other side of the mountains , I met a fantoccini player . It was at a wine‐shop , hard by Luzarches . He had a woman‐child with him who danced to his music , and whom the people praised for her beauty , and who anticked like a dancing dog , and who made a great deal of silver . We got friends , he and I. At the week ’s end the brat died : some sickness of the throat , they said . Her master tore his hair and raved ; the little wretch was worth handfuls of coin to him . For such another he would give twelve gold pieces . He shall have her . She will dance for him and me ; there is plenty to be made in that way . The women are fools over a handsome child ; they open their larders and their purses . I shall take her away before sunrise ; he says he teaches them in seven days , by starving them and giving them the stick . She will dance while she is a child . Later on — there are the theatres ; she will be strong and handsome , and in the great cities , now , a woman ’s comeliness is as a mine of gold ore . I shall take her away by sunrise . ”
23005	23010	23032	23032	she	126	“ To sell her ? ”
23065	23113	23061	23061	Taric	124	“ Surely ; why not ? I will make a dancing dog of her for the peasants ’ pastime ; and in time she will make dancing dogs of the nobles and the princes for her own sport . It is a brave life — none better . ”
23153	23159	23160	23160	she	1082	“ What will Phratos say ? ”
23165	23212	23160	23160	she	1082	“ Phratos ? A rotten fig for Phratos ! What can he say — or do ? The little beast is mine ; I can wring its neck if I choose , and if it refuse to pipe when we play for it , I will . ”
23429	23435	23437	23437	Phratos	121	“ It was my doing ! ”
23576	23585	23586	23586	he	121	“ Hush ! it is I , Phratos , ”
23843	23848	23849	23850	the child	272	“ Is it morning ? ”
23856	23865	23866	23866	he	121	“ No , dear ; it is night , ”
24453	24471	24472	24473	the peasants	703	“ There is a curse written against all honest folk on every one of those shaking coins , ”
25073	25080	25081	25081	he	121	“ Art thou cold , dear ? ”
25132	25135	25122	25122	she	272	“ No . ”
25432	25441	25442	25442	he	121	“ They will surely be good to her ? ”
25445	25458	25442	25442	he	121	“ Old people , and prosperous , and alone by their fireside . ”
25713	25732	25733	25733	he	121	“ Thou wilt go in there the old man yonder , and sleep by that pleasant fire to‐night , ”
25738	25771	25733	25733	he	121	“ And thou wilt be good and gentle , and even as thou art to me always ; and to‐morrow at noontide I will come and see how it fares with thee . ”
25779	25787	25788	25788	she	1170	“ I will not go without thee , ”
25951	25956	25957	25957	he	121	“ Go , dear , ”
26069	26080	26081	26081	he	121	“ I will see how it is with her to‐morrow , ”
26095	26342	26081	26081	he	121	“ If it be well with her — let it be well . If not , she must come forth with me , and we must seek some lair where her wolf‐sire shall not prowl and discover her . But it will be hard to f ind ; for the vengeance of Taric is swift of foot and has a far‐stretching hand an eyes that are sleepless . And his heart was heavy in him as he went . He had done what seemed to him just and due to the child and her mother ; he had been true to the vow he had made answering the mute prayer of the sightless dead eyes ; he had saved the flesh of the child from the whip of the trainer , and the future of the child from the shame of the brothel ; he had done thus much in saving her from her father , and he had done it in the only way the was possible to him . Yet his heart was heavy as he went ; and it seemed to him even as though he had thrust some mountain bird with pinions that would cleave the clouds , and eyes that would seek the sun , and a song that would rise with the dawn , and a courage that would breast the thunder , down into the darkness of a trap , to be shorn and crippled and silenced for evermore . “
26349	26620	26343	26343	I	0	” he told himself ; restless with a vague remorse , as though the good he had done had been evil . But when the morrow dawned there had happened that to Phratos which forbade him to see whether it were well with her that day or any day in all the many years that came . For Phratos that night , being blinded and shrouded in the storm of snow , lost such slender knowledge as he had of that northern country , and wandered far afield , not knowing where he was in the wide white desert , on which no single star‐ray shone . The violence of the storm grew with the hours . The land was a sheet of snow . The plains were dim and trackless as a desert . Sheep were frozen in their folds , and cattle drowned amidst the ice in the darkness . All lights were out , and the warning peals of the bells were drowned in the tempest of the winds . The land was strange to him , and he lost all knowledge where he was . Above , beneath , around , were the dense rolling clouds of snow . Now and then through the tumult of the hurricane there was blown a strange harsh burst of jangled chimes that wailed a moment loudly on the silence and then died again . At many doors he knocked : the doors of little lonely places standing in the great colourless waste . But each door , being opened cautiously , was with haste shut in his face again . “
26626	26781	26623	26624	a gypsy	893	” the people muttered , and were afraid ; and they drew their bars closer and huddled together in their beds , and thanked their saints that they were safe beneath a roof . He wrapped his sheepskin closer round him and set his face against the blast . A hundred times he strove to set his steps backwards to the town , and a hundred times he failed ; and moved round and round vainly , never escaping the maze of the endless white fields . Now the night was long , and he was weakly . In the midst of the fields there was a cross , and at the head of the cross hung a lantern . The wind tossed the light to and fro . It flickered on the head of a woman . She lay in the snow , and her hand grasped his foot as he passed her . “
26786	26792	26782	26782	I	0	” she said to him : “
26805	27063	27064	27065	The woman	633	” And as she spoke , her lips closed together and her throat rattled , and she died . The boy slept at her feet , and babbled in his sleep , delirious . Phratos stooped down and raised him . He was a child of eight years , and worn with famine and fever , and his gaunt eyes stared hideously up at the driving snow . Phratos folded him in his arms , and went on with him : the snow had nearly covered the body of his mother . All around him were the fields . There was no light , except from the lantern on the cross . A few sheep huddled near without a shepherd . The stillness was intense . The bells had ceased to ring , or he had wandered far from the sound of them . The lad was senseless ; he muttered drearily foolish words of fever ; his limbs hung in a dead weight ; his teeth chattered . Phratos , bearing him , struggled on : the snow was deep and drifted heavily ; every now and then he stumbled and plunged to his knees in a rift of earth or in a shallow pool of ice . At last his strength , feeble at all times , failed him ; his arms could bear their burden no longer ; he let the young boy slip from his hold upon the ground ; and stood , breathless and broken , with the snowflakes beating on him . “
27069	27706	27064	27065	The woman	633	” he thought ; she was a stranger , she was a beggar , she was dead . She had no bond upon him , neither could she ever bear witness against him . Yet he was loyal to her . He unwound the sheepskin that he wore , and stripped himself of it , and folded it about the sick child , and with a slow laborious effort drew the little body under the frail shelter of a knot of furze , and wrapped it closely round , and left it there . It was all that he could do . Then , with no defence between him and the driving cold , he strove once more to find his road . It was quite dark ; quite still . The snow fell ceaselessly ; the white wide land was pathless as the sea . He stumbled on as a mule may that being blind and bruised yet holds its way from the sheer instinct of its sad dumb patience . His veins were frozen ; his beard was ice ; the wind cut his flesh like a scourge ; a sickly dreamy sleepiness stole on him . He knew well what it meant . He tried to rouse himself ; he was young , and his life had its sweetness ; and there were faces he would fain have seen again , and voices whose laughter he would fain have heard . He drew the viol round and touched its strings ; but his frozen fingers had lost their cunning , and the soul of the music was chilled and dumb : it only sighed in answer . He kissed it softly as he would have kissed a woman ’s lips , and put it in his bosom . It had all his youth in it . Then he stumbled onward yet again , feebly , being a cripple and cold to the bone , and pierced with a million thorns of pain . There was no light anywhere . The endless wilderness of the ploughed lands stretched all around him ; where the little hamlets clustered the storm hid them ; no light could penetrate the denseness of that changeless gloom ; and the only sound that rose upon the ghastly silence was the moaning of some perishing flock locked in a flood of ice , and deserted by its shepherd . But what he saw and what he heard were not these ; going barefoot and blindfold to his death , the things of his own land were with him ; the golden glories of sunsets of paradise ; the scarlet blaze of a wilderness of flowers ; the sound of the fountains at midnight ; the glancing of the swift feet in the dances ; the sweetness of songs sad as death sung in the desolate courts of the old palaces ; the deep dreamy hush of white moons shining through lines of palms straight on a silvery sea . These arose and drifted before him , and he ceased to suffer or to know , and sleep conquered him ; and he dropped down on the earth noiselessly and powerlessly as a leaf sins ; and the snow fell and covered him . When the morning broke a peasant , going to his labour in the fields while the stormy winter sun rose red over the whitened world , found both his body and the child ’s . The boy was warm and living , still beneath the shelter of the sheepskin : Phratos was dead . The people succoured the child , and nursed and fed him so that his life was saved ; but to Phratos they only gave such burial as the corby gives the stricken deer . “
27717	27851	27064	27065	The woman	633	” they said ; and they left him there , and the snow kept him . His viol they robbed him of , and cast it as a plaything to their children . But the children could make no melody from its dumb strings . For the viol was faithful ; and its music was dead too . And his own land and his own people knew him never again ; and never again at evening was the voice of his viol heard in the stillness ; and never again did the young men and the maidens dance to his bidding , and the tears and the laughter rise and fall at his will , and the beasts and the birds frisk and sing at his coming , and the children in his footsteps cry:—“Lo
27862	28703	28704	28704	Marengo	134	” THE hottest sun of a hot summer shone on a straight dusty road . An old man was breaking stones by the wayside ; he was very old , very bent , very lean , worn by ninety years if he had been worn by one ; but he struck yet with a will , and the flints flew in a thousand pieces under his hammer , as though the youth and the force of nineteen years instead of ninety were at work on them . When the noon bell rang from a little odd straight steeple , with a slanting roof , that peered out of the trees to the westward , he laid his hammer aside , threw off his brass‐plated cap , wiped his forehead of its heat and dust , sat down on his pile of stones , and took out hard black crust and munched it with teeth that were still strong and white . The noontide was very quiet ; the heat was intense , for there had been no rainfall for several weeks ; there was one lark singing high up in the air , with its little breast lifted to the sun ; but all the other birds were mute and invisible , doubtless hidden in some delicious shadow , swinging drowsily on tufts of linden bloom , or underneath the roofing of broad chestnut leaves . The road on either side was lined by the straight forms of endless poplars , standing side by side as sentinels . The fields were all ablaze on every acre with the gold of ripening corn or mustard , and the scarlet flame of innumerable poppies . Here and there they were broken by some little house , white or black , or painted in bright colours , which lifted up amongst its leaves a little tower like a sugar‐loaf or a carved gable , and a pointed arch beneath it . Now and then they were divided by rows of trees standing breathless in the heat , or breadths of apple orchards , some with early fruits already ripe , some with fruits as yet green as their foliage . Through it all the river ran , silver in the light ; with shallow fords , where the deep‐flanked bullocks drank ; and ever and anon an ancient picturesque bridge of wood , time‐bronzed and moss‐embroidered . The old man did not look round once ; he had been on these roads a score of years ; the place had to him the monotony and colourlessness which all long familiar scenes wear to the eyes that are weary of them . He was ninety‐five ; he had to labour for his living ; he ate black bread ; he had no living kith or kin ; no friend save in the mighty legion of the dead ; and he sat in the scorch of the sun ; he hated the earth and the sky , the air and the landscape : why not ? They had no loveliness for him ; he only knew that the flies stung him and that the red ants could crawl through the holes in his shoes , and bite him sharply with their little piercing teeth . He sat in such shade as the tall lean poplar gave , munching his hard crusts ; he had a fine keen profile and a long white beard that were thrown out as sharply as a sculpture against the golden sunlight , in which the gnats were dancing . His eyes were fastened on the dust as he ate ; blue piercing eyes that had still something of the fire of their youth ; and his lips under the white hair moved a little now and then , half audibly . His thoughts were with the long dead years of an unforgotten time — a time that will be remembered as long as the earth shall circle round the sun . With the present he had nothing to do ; he worked to satisfy the lingering cravings of a body that age seemed to have lost all power to kill ; he worked because he was too much of a man still to beg , and because suicide looked to his fancy like a weakness , but life for all that was over with him ; life in the years of his boyhood had been a thing so splendid , so terrible , so drunken , so divine , so tragic , so intense , that the world seemed now to him to have grown pale and grey and pulseless , with no sap in its veins , no hue in its suns , no blood in its humanity . For his memory held the days of Thermidor ; the weeks of the White Terror ; the winter dawn , when the drums rolled out a King ’s threnody ; the summer nights , when all the throats of Paris cried “
28706	29200	28704	28704	Marengo	134	” He had lived in the wondrous awe of that abundant time when every hour was an agony or a victory ; when every woman was a martyr or a bacchanal ; when the same scythe that had severed the flowering grasses served also to cleave the fair breasts of the mother , the tender throat of the child ; when the ground was purple with the blue blood of men as with the juices of out‐trodden grapes , and when the waters were white with the bodies of virgins as with the moon‐fed lilies of summer . And how he sat here by the wayside , in the dust and the sun , only feeling the sting of the fly and the bite of the ant ; and the world seemed dead to him , because so long ago , though his body still lived on , his soul and had cursed God and died . Through the golden notes of the dancing air and of the quivering sunbeams , whilst high above the lark sang on , there came along the road a girl . She was bare‐footed and bare‐throated , lithe of movement , and straight and supple , as one who passed her life on the open lands and was abroad in all changes of the weather . She walked with the free and fearless measure of the country women of Rome or the desert‐born women of Nubia ; she had barely entered his sixteenth year ; but her bosom and limbs were full and firm , and moulded with almost the luxuriant splendor of maturity ; her head was not covered after the fashion of the country , but had a scarlet kerchief wound about , and on it she bore a great flat basket , filled high with fruits and herbs and flowers ; a mass of colour and of blossom , through whose leaves and tendrils her dark level brows and her great eyes , blue black as a tempestuous night , looked out , set straight against the sun . She came on , treading down the dust with her long and slender feet , that were such feet as a sculptor would give his Cleopatra or his Phryne . Her face was grave , shadowed , even fierce ; and her mouth , though scarlet as a berry and full and curled , had its lips pressed close to one another , like the lips of one who has long kept silence , and may keep it — until death . As she saw the old man her eyes changed and lightened with a smile which for the moment banished all the gloom and savage patience from her eyes , and made them mellow and lustrous as a southern sun . She paused before him , and spoke , showing her beautiful white teeth , small and even , like rows of cowrie shells . “
29207	29242	29243	29243	Fool	4877	” The old man started , and looked up with a certain gladness on his own keen visage , which had lost all expression save such as an intense and absorbed retrospection will lend . “
29245	29255	29243	29243	Fool	4877	” he made answer , harshly yet not unkindly . “
29280	29281	29258	29258	you	1200	” “
29295	29359	29258	29258	you	1200	” She spoke in the accent and the language of the province , but with a voice rich and pure and cold ; not the voice of the north , or of any peasantry . She put her basket down from off her head , and leaned against the trunk of the poplar beside him , crossing her arms upon her bare chest . “
29372	29500	29368	29370	the old nothing	1205	” he said curtly . Her eyes gleamed with a fierce thirsty longing ; she made him no reply . He broke off half his dry bread and tendered it to her . She shook her head and motioned it away ; yet she was as hungered as any hawk that has hunted all through the night and the woods , and has killed nothing . The growing life , the superb strength , the lofty stature of her made her need constant nourishment , as young trees need it ; and she was fed as scantily as a blind beggar ’s dog , and less willingly than a galley slave . The kindly air had fed her richly , strongly , continually ; that was all . “
29503	29511	29368	29370	the old nothing	1205	” she said slowly , after awhile . “
29521	29531	29516	29516	I	0	” The old man , Marcellin , smiled grimly . “
29593	29645	29590	29590	You	0	” She mused a moment ; her brain was rapid in intuitive perception , but barren of all culture ; it took her many moments to follow the filmy track of a metaphorical utterance . But by degrees she saw his meaning , and the shadow settled over her face again . “
29657	29669	29714	29714	I	0	” she said slowly . The old man smiled still grimly . “
29722	29723	29724	29725	The priests	514	” “
29727	29759	29724	29725	The priests	514	” All the scorn of which her curved lips were capable curled on them , and a deep hate gathered in her eyes — a hate that was unfathomable and mute . “
29770	29775	29724	29725	The priests	514	” she said bitterly , “
29787	29812	29780	29780	priests	493	” Marcellin looked up at her from under his bushy white eyebrows ; a glance fleet and keen as the gleam of blue steel . “
29818	29823	29780	29780	priests	493	” he said curtly . “
29841	29842	29780	29780	priests	493	” “
29847	29886	29780	29780	priests	493	” she muttered . There was impatience in her echo of the words , and yet there was an awe also as of one who uses a name that is mighty and full of majesty , although familiar . “
29891	29895	29780	29780	priests	493	” repeated Marcellin . “
29904	29943	29780	29780	priests	493	” His meaning this time lay too deep for her , and passed her ; she stood leaning against the poplar , with her head bent and her form motionless in the sunlight like a statue of bronze . “
29953	29958	29948	29948	they	364	” she said suddenly : “
29967	29975	29961	29961	they	364	” The old man stroked his beard . “
29992	30079	29981	29981	Cain	137	” She mused over the saying ; silent still . The lark dropped down from heaven , suddenly falling through the air , mute . It had been struck by a sparrow‐hawk , which flashed black against the azure of the skies and the white haze of the atmosphere ; and which flew down in the track of the lark and seized it ere it gained the shelter of the grass and bore it away within his talons . Marcellin pointed to it with his pipe‐stem . “
30091	30093	29981	29981	Cain	137	” — “
30099	30113	29981	29981	Cain	137	” she added . The old man took his pipe back and smoked . “
30123	30140	29981	29981	Cain	137	” Again she did not comprehend ; a puzzled pain clouded the lustre of her eyes . “
30155	30160	30161	30161	Abel	138	” Marcellin smiled grimly . “
30175	30582	30161	30161	Abel	138	” She was silent yet again ; he had told her that old story of the sons born of Eve , and the one whom , hearing it , she had understood and pitied had been Cain . At that moment , through the roadway that wound across the meadows and through the corn lands and the trees , there came in sight a gleam of scarlet that was not from the poppies , a flash of silver that was not from the river , a column of smoke that was not from the weeds that burned on the hillside . There came a cloud , with a melodious murmur softly rising from it : a cloud that moved between the high flowering hedges , the tall amber wheat , the slender poplars , and the fruitful orchards ; a cloud that grew larger and clearer as it drew more near to them , and left the green water meadows and winding field paths for the great high road . It was a procession of the Church . It drew closer and closer by slow imperceptible degrees , until it approached them ; the old man sat upright , not taking his cap from his head nor his pipe from his mouth ; the young girl cease to lean for rest against the tree , and stood with her arms crossed on her breast . The Church passed them ; the great gilt crucifix held aloft , the scarlet and the white of the robes catch‐ ing the sunlight ; the silver chains and silver censers gleaming ; the fresh young voices of the singing children cleaving the air like a rush of wind ; the dark shorn faces of the priests bowed over open books , the tender sound of the bells ringing across the low deep monotony of prayer . The Church passed them ; the dust of the parched road rose up in a choking mass ; the heavy mist of the incense hung darkly on the sunlit air ; the tramp of the many feet startled the birds from their rest , and pierced through the noonday silence . It passed them , and left them behind it ; but the fresh leaves were choked and whitened ; the birds were fluttered and affrightened ; the old man coughed , the girl strove to brush the dust motes from her smarting eyelids . “
30588	30597	30862	30862	thou	1225	” said the stone‐breaker , with a smile . “
30610	30637	30862	30862	thou	1225	” Now she understood ; and her beautiful curled lips laughed mutely . The old man rammed some more tobacco into the bowl of his pipe . “
30643	30647	30862	30862	thou	1225	” he said . “
30666	30803	30663	30664	the rainmakers	1224	” The procession passed away out of sight , going along the highway and winding by the course of the river , calling to the bright blue heavens for rain ; whilst the little bells rang and the incense curled and the priest prayed themselves hoarse , and the peasants toiled footsore , and the eager steps of the choral children trod the tiny gnat dead in the grasses and the bright butterfly dead in the dust . The priests had cast a severer look from out their down‐dropped eyelids ; the children had huddled together , with their voices faltering a little ; and the boy choristers had shot out their lips in gestures of defiance and opprobrium as they had passed these twain beneath the wayside trees . For the two were both outcasts . “
30814	30860	30805	30805	thou	1225	” whispered to another one fair and curly‐headed baby , who was holding in the sun her little , white , silver‐fringed banner , and catching the rise and fall of the sonorous chaunt as well as she could with her little , lisping tones . “
30870	31046	30862	30862	thou	1225	” muttered to another a handsome golden brown boy , who had left his herd untended in the meadow to don his scarlet robes and swing about the censer of his village chapel . And they all sang louder , and tossed more incense on high , and marched more closely together under the rays of the gleaming crucifix as they went ; feeling that they had been beneath the shadow of the powers of darkness , and that they were purer and holier and more exalted , because they had thus passed by in scorn what was accursed with psalms on their lips , with the cross as their symbol . So they went their way through the peaceful country with a glory of sunbeams about them — through the corn , past the orchards , by the river , into the heart of the old brown , quiet town , and about the foot of the great cathedral , where they kneeled down int he dust and prayed , then rose and sang the “
31049	31140	30805	30805	thou	1225	” Then , the tall dark‐visaged priest , who had led them all thither under the standard of the golden crucifix , lifted his voice alone and implored God , and exhorted man ; implored for rain and all the blessings of harvest , exhorted to patience and the imitation of God . The people were moved and saddened , and listened , smiting their breasts ; and after a while rising from their knees , many of them in tears , dispersed and went their ways , muttering to one another:—“We
31162	31167	30862	30862	thou	1225	” and answering to one another:—“We
31191	31201	31202	31202	Lo	114	” For the priests had not said to them , “
31221	31581	31582	31583	This man	1234	” IN the days of his youngest youth , in the old drunken days that were dead , this old stone‐breaker Marcellin had known such life as it is given to few men to know — a life of the soul and the senses ; a life of storm and delight ; a life mad with blood and wine ; a life of divinest dreams ; a life when women kissed them , and bade them slay ; a life when mothers blessed them and bade them die ; a life , strong , awful , splendid , unutterable ; a life seized at its fullest and fiercest and fairest , out of an air that was death , off an earth that was hell . When his cheeks had had a boy ’s bloom and his curls a boy ’s gold he had seen a nation in delirium ; he had been one of the elect of a people ; he had uttered the words that burn , and wrought the acts that live ; he had been of the Thousand of Marsala ; and he had been of the avengers in Thermidor : he had raised his flute‐like voice from the tribune , and he had cast in his vote for the death of a king ; passions had been his playthings , and he had toyed with life as a child with a match ; he had beheld the despised enthroned in power , and desolation left within kings ’ palaces ; he too had been fierce , and glad , and cruel , and gay , and drunken , and proud , as the whole land was ; he had seen the white beauty of the royal women bare in the hands of the mob , and the throats that princes had caressed kissed by the broad steel knife ; he had had his youth in a wondrous time , when all men had been gods or devils , and all women martyrs or furies . And now,—he broke stones to get daily bread , and those who passed him by cursed him , saying : “
31588	31914	31582	31583	This man	1234	” For he had outlived his time , and the life that had been golden and red at its dawn was now grey and pale as the ashes of a fire grown cold ; for in all the list of the world ’s weary errors there is no mistake so deadly as age . Years before , in such hot summer weather as this , against which the Church had prayed , the old man , going homewards to his little cabin amidst the fields , had met a little child coming straight towards him in the full crimson glow of the setting sun , and with the flame of the poppies all around her . He hardly knew why he looked at her , but when he had once looked his eyes rested there . She had the hues of his youth about her ; in that blood‐red light , amongst the blood‐red flowers , she made him think of women ’s forms that he had seen in all their grace and their voluptuous loveliness clothed in the red garment of death , and standing on the dusky red of the scaffold as the burning mornings of the summers of slaughter had risen over the land . The child was all alone before him in that intense glow as of fire ; above her there was a tawny sky , flushed here and there with purple ; around her stretched the solitary level of the fields burnt yellow as gold by the long mouths of heat . There were stripes on her shoulders blue and black from the marks of a thong . He looked at her , and stopped her , why he hardly knew , except that a look about her , beaten but yet unsubdued , attracted him . He had seen the look of yore in the years of his youth , on the faces of the nobles he hated . “
31920	31944	31916	31916	you	1236	” he asked her in his harsh , strong voice . She put her heavy load of faggots down and stared at him . “
31947	31973	31582	31583	This man	1234	” She echoed the word stupidly . No one ever thought she could be hurt ; what was done to her was punishment and justice . “
31984	32001	32021	32021	Flamma	117	” She gave a gesture of assent with her head , but she did not answer . “
32006	32020	32021	32021	Flamma	117	” he pursued . A cloud of passion swept over her beat face . “
32023	32024	32021	32021	Flamma	117	” “
32029	32030	32031	32031	They	1237	” “
32035	32036	32031	32031	They	1237	” “
32047	32048	32049	32049	I	0	” “
32054	32055	32049	32049	I	0	” “
32059	32060	32049	32049	I	0	” “
32074	32111	32049	32049	I	0	” Marcellin leaned on his elm stick , and fastened on her his keen passionless eyes with a look which , for him who shunned and was shunned by all his kind , was almost sympathy . “
32117	32123	32124	32124	I	0	” he said to her . “
32141	32497	32124	32124	I	0	” The child followed him passively , half stupidly ; he was the first creature that had ever bidden her go with him , and this rough pity of his was sweet to her , with an amazing incredible balm in it which only those can know who see raised against them every man ’s hand , and hear on their ears the mockery of all the voices of their world . Under reviling , and contempt , and constant rejection , she had become savage as a trapped hawk , wild as an escaped panther ; but to him she was obedient and passive , because he had spoken to her without a taunt and without a curse , which until now had been the sole two forms of human speech that she had heard . His little hut was in the midst of those spreading cornfields , set where two pathways crossed each other , and stretched down the gentle slope of the cultured lands to join the great highway — a hut of stones and plaited rushes , with of roof of thatch , where the old republican , hardy of frame and born of a toiling race , dwelt in solitude , and broke his scanty bitter bread without lament , if without content . He took some leaves of a simple herb that he knew , soaked them with water , and bound them on her shoulders , not ungently , though his hand was so rough with labour , and , as men said , had been so often red with carnage . Then he gave her a draught of goat ’s milk , sweet and fresh , from a wooden bowl ; shared with her the dry black crusts that formed his only evening meal ; bestowed on her a gift of a rare old scarlet scarf of woven wools and eastern broideries , one of the few relics of his buried life ; lifted the faggots on her back , so that she could carry them with greater ease ; and set her on her homeward way . “
32503	32549	32124	32124	I	0	” he said , briefly , as she went across the threshold . The child bent her head in silence , and kissed his hand quickly and timidly , like a grateful dog that is amazed to have a caress , and not a blow . “
32568	32597	32561	32561	I	0	” the old man muttered as he stood in his doorway looking after her shadow as it passed small and dark across the scarlet light of the poppies . “
32611	32677	32604	32604	they	1239	” thought the child , who had long known his face , though he had never noted hers ; and it seemed to her that all mercy lay in her father ’s kingdom — which they called the kingdom of evil . The cool moist herbs slaked the heat of her bruises ; and the draught of milk had slaked the thirst of her throat . “
32682	33766	33767	33767	Georges	140	” she asked in her heart as she went through the tall red poppies . And from that evening thenceforward Folle‐Farine and Marcellin cleaved to one another , being outcasts from all others . AS the religious gathering broke up and split in divers streams to divers ways , the little town returned to its accustomed stillness — a stillness that seemed to have in it the calm of a thousand sleeping years , and the legends and the dreams of half a score of old dead centuries . On market‐days and saint‐days , days of high feast or of perpetual chaffering , the town was full of colour , movement , noise , and population . The country people crowded in , filling it with the jingling of mule‐bells ; the fisher people came , bringing with them the crisp salt smell of the sea and the blue of the sea on their garments ; its own tanners and ivory carvers , and fruiterers , and lacemakers turned out by the hundred in all the quaint variety of costumes which their forefathers had bequeathed to them , and to which they were still wise enough to adhere . But at other times when the fishers were in their hamlets , and the peasantry on their lands and in their orchards , and the townsfolk at their labours in the old renaissance mansions , which they had turned into tanneries , and granaries , and wool‐sheds , and workshops , the place was profoundly still ; scarcely a child at play in the streets , scarcely a dog asleep in the sun . When the crowds had gone the priests laid aside their vestments , and donned the black serge of their daily habit , and went to their daily avocations in their humble dwellings . The crosses and the censers were put back upon their altars , and hung up upon their pillars . The boy choristers and the little children put their white linen and their scarlet robes back in cupboards and presses , with heads of lavender and sprigs of rosemary to keep the moth and the devil away , and went to their fields , to their homes , to their herds , to their paper kites , to their daisy chains , to the poor rabbits they pent in a hutch , to the poor flies they killed in the sun . The town became quite still , the market place quite empty ; the drowsy silence of a burning , cloudless afternoon was over all the quiet places about the cathedral walls , where of old the bishops and the canons dwelt ; grey shady courts ; dim open cloisters ; houses covered with oaken carvings , and shadowed with the spreading branches of chestnuts and of lime‐trees that were as aged as themselves . Under the shelter of one of the lindens , after the populace had gone , there was seated on a broad stone bench the girl who had stood by the wayside erect and unbending as the procession had moved before her . She had flung herself down in dreamy restfulness . She had delivered her burden of vegetables and fruit at a shop near by , whose awning stretched out into the street like a toadstool yellow with the sun . The heat was intense ; she had been on foot all day ; she sat to rest a moment , and put her burning hands under a little rill of water that spouted into a basin in a niche in the wall . An ancient well , with a stone image of the Madonna sculptured above , and a wreath of vine‐leaves in stone running around , in the lavish ornamentation of an age when men loved loveliness for its own sake , and begrudged neither time nor labour in its service . She leaned over the fountain , kept so cool by the roofing of the thick green leaves ; there was a metal cup attached to the basin by a chain , and she filled it at the running thread of water , and stooped her lips to it again and again thirstily . The day was sultry ; the ways were long and white with powdered limestone ; her throat was still parched with the dust raised by the many feet of the multitude ; and although she had borne in the great basket which now stood empty at her side , cherries , peaches , mulberries , melons , full of juice and lusciousness , this daughter of the devil had not taken even one to freshen her dry mouth . Folle‐Farine stooped to the water and played with it , and drank it , and steeped her lips and her arms in it ; lying there on the stone bench , with her bare feet curled one in another , and her slender round limbs full of the voluptuous repose of a resting panther . The coolness , the murmur , the clearness , the peace , the soft flowing movement of water , possess an ineffable charm for natures that are passion‐tossed , feverish , and full of storm . There was a dreary peace about the place , too , which had charms likewise for her ; in the dusky arch of the long cloisters , in the grey lichen‐grown walls , in the broad pamments of the paven court , in the clusters of strange delicate carving beneath and below ; in the sculptured friezes where little nests that the birds had made in the spring still rested , and in the dense brooding thickness of the boughs which brought the sweetness and the shadows of the woods into the heart of the peopled town . She stayed there , loath to move ; loath to return where a jeer , a bruise , a lifted stick , a muttered curse , were all her greeting and her guerdon . As she lay thus , one of the doors in the old houses in the cloisters opened ; the head of an old woman was thrust out , crowned with the high fan‐shaped comb , and the towering white linen cap , that are the female note of that especial town . The old woman wa the mother of the sacristan , and she , looking out , shrieked shrilly to her son : “
33784	34036	33774	33775	The devil	4853	” The sacristan was hoeing amongst his cabbages in the garden behind his house , surrounded with clipt yew , and damp from the deep shade of the cathedral , that overshadowed it . He ran out at his mother ’s call , hoe in hand , himself an old man , though stout and strong . The well in the wall was his especial charge and pride ; immeasurable sanctity attached to it . According to tradition , the water had spouted from the stone itself , at the touch of a branch of blossoming pear , held in the hand of St. Jerome , who had returned to earth in the middle of the fourteenth century , and dwelt for a while near the cathedral , working at the honourable trade of a cordwainer , and accomplishing mighty miracles throughout the district . It was said that some of his miraculous power still remained in the fountain , and that even yet , those who drank on St. Jerome ’s day , in full faith and with believing hearts , were , oftentimes , cleansed of sin , and purified of bodily diseases . Wherefore on that day , throngs of peasantry flocked in from all sides , and crowded round it , and drank ; to the benefit of the sacristan in charge , if not to that of their souls and bodies . Summoned by his mother , he flew to the rescue of the sanctified spring . “
34041	34045	33774	33775	The devil	4853	” he shouted . “
34078	34150	34067	34067	God	118	” Folle‐Farine lifted her head and looked him in the face with her audacious eyes , and laughed ; then tossed her head again , and plunged it into the bright living water , till her lips , and her cheeks , and all the rippling hair about her temples sparkled with its silvery drops . The sacristan , infuriated at once by the impiety and the defiance , shrieked aloud . “
34176	34601	34602	34602	They	1250	” And he seized her roughly with one hand upon her shoulder , and with the other raised the hoe and brandished the wooden staff of it above her head in threat to strike her ; whilst his old mother , still thrusting her lofty head‐gear and her wrinkled face from out of the door , screamed to him to show he was a man , and have no mercy . As his grasp touched her , and the staff cast its shadow across her , Folle‐Farine sprang up , defiance and fury breathing from all her beautiful fierce face . She seized the staff in her right hand , wrenched it with a swift movement from his hold , and catching his head under her left arm , rained blows on him from his own weapon with a sudden gust of breathless rage which blinded him , and lent to her slender muscular limbs , the strength and force of man . Then , as rapidly as she had seized and struck him , she flung him from her with such violence that he fell prostrate on the pavement of the court ; caught up the metal pail which stood by ready filled , dashed the water over him where he lay , and turning from him without a word , walked across the courtyard slowly , and with a haughty grace in all the carriage of her bare limbs , and the folds of her ragged garments ; bearing the empty osier‐basket on her head , deaf as the stones around to the screams of the sacristan and his mother . In these secluded cloisters , and in the high noontide , when all were sleeping or eating in the cool shelter of their darkened houses , the old woman ’s voice remained unheard . The saints heard , no doubt , but they were too lazy to stir from their niches in that sultry noontide ; except the baying of a chained dog aroused , there was no answer to the outcry , and Folle‐Farine passed out into the market place unarrested , and not meeting another living creature . As she turned into one of the squares that led to the open country , she saw in the distance one of the guardians of the peace of the town moving quickly towards the cloisters , with his glittering lace shining in the sun , and his long scabbard clattering upon the stones . She laughed a little as she saw . “
34609	34615	34602	34602	They	1250	” she said to herself . “
34624	35077	35078	35078	You	1251	” She judged rightly ; they did not come . She crossed the wide scorching square , whose white stones blazed in the glare of the sun . There was nothing in sight except a stray cat prowling in a corner , and three sparrows quarrelling over a foul‐smelling heap of refuse . The quaint old houses round seemed all asleep , with the shutters closed like tired eyelids over their little dim , aged , orbs of windows . The gilded vanes on their twisted chimneys , and carved parapets , pointed motionless to the warm south . There was not a sound except for the cawing of some rooks , who built their nests high aloft in the fretted pinnacles of the cathedral . Undisturbed she crossed the square , and took her way down the crooked street that led her homeward to the outlying country . It was an old , twisting , dusky place , with the water flowing through its centre as its only roadway ; and in there were the oldest houses of the town , all of timber , black with age , and carved with the wonderful florid fantasies and grotesque conceits of the years when a house was to its master a thing beloved and beautiful , a bulwark , an altar , a heritage , an heirloom to be dwelt in all the days of a long life , and bequeathed in all honour and honesty to a noble offspring . The street was very silent , the ripple of the water was the chief sound that filled it . Its tenants were very poor , in many of its antique mansions the beggars shared shelter with the rats and the owls . In one of these dwellings , however , there were still some warmth and colour . The orange and scarlet flowers of a nasturtium curled up its twisted pilasters ; the big , fair clusters of hydrangea filled up its narrow casements ; a breadth of many‐coloured saxifrage , with leaves of green and rose , and blossoms of purple and white , hung over the balcony rail , which five centuries earlier had been draped with cloth of gold ; and a little yellow song bird made music in the empty niche from which the sculptured flower‐de‐luce had been so long torn down . From the window a woman looked , leaning with folded arms above the rose‐tipped saxifrage , and beneath the green‐leaved vine . She was a fair woman , white as the lilies , and she had silver pins in her amber hair , and a mouth that laughed sweetly . She called to Folle‐Farine , “
35089	35102	35084	35084	you	1251	” Folle‐Farine started and withdrew the fixed gaze of her lustrous eyes . “
35108	35293	35104	35104	you	1251	” she answered curtly . All beautiful things head a fascination for her . This woman above was very fair to see , and she looked at her as she looked at the purple butterflies in the sun ; at the stars shining down through the leaves ; at the vast , dim , gorgeous figures in the cathedral windows ; at the happy children running to their mothers with their hands full of primroses , as she saw them in the woods at spring‐time ; at the laughing groups round the wood‐fires in the new year time when she passed a lattice pane that the snow‐drift had not blocked ; at all the things that were so often in her sight , and yet with which her life had no part or likeness . She stood there on the rough flints , in the darkness cast from the jutting beams of the house ; and the other happier creature leaned above there in the light , white and rose‐hued , and with the silver bells of the pins shaking in her yellow tresses . “
35301	35311	35294	35294	You	1252	” cried the other from her leafy nest above . “
35323	35324	35312	35312	You	1252	” “
35327	35328	35312	35312	You	1252	” “
35383	35384	35385	35385	He	1254	” “
35390	35406	35408	35408	he	1254	” the child muttered wearily ; had she not besought him endlessly with breathless prayers ? “
35419	35420	35450	35450	they	4948	” “
35424	35434	35450	35450	they	4948	” asked Folle‐Farine , with a quick startled breath . “
35453	35454	35450	35450	they	4948	” “
35459	35466	35457	35457	you	1252	” The fair woman above laughed : “
35481	35525	35474	35474	he	1254	” and she plucked one of the silver pins from her hair , and stabbed the rosy foam of the saxifrage through and through with it ; for she was but a gardener ’s wife , and was restless and full of discontent . “
35530	35535	35474	35474	he	1254	” she added quickly , “
35568	35664	35558	35558	you	1252	” Folle‐Farine went on her way over the sharp stones with a heavy heart . That picture in the casement head had made that passage bright to her many a time ; and when at last that picture had moved and spoken , it had only mocked her and reviled her as the rest did . The street was dark for her like all the others now . The gardener ’s wife , leaning there , with the green and gold of the vineleaves brushing her hair , looked after her down the crooked way . “
35675	36217	35665	35667	That young wretch	1262	” she thought ; and the thought was bitter to her , as such a one is to a fair woman . Folle‐Farine went slowly and sadly through the street with her head dropped , and the large osier basket trailing behind her over the stones . She was well used to be pelted with words hard as hailstones , and usually heeded them little , or gave them back with sullen , fierce defiance . But from this woman they had wounded her ; for that bright bower of golden leaves and scarlet flowers she had faintly fancied some stray beam of light might wander even to her . She was soon outside the gates of the town , and beyond the old walls , where the bramble and the lichen grew over the huge stones of ramparts and fortifications , useless and decayed from age . The country roads and paths , the silver streams and the wooden bridges , the lanes through which the market mules picked their careful way , the fields in which the white‐capped peasant women and the brindled oxen were at work , stretched all before her in a radiant air , sweet with the scent of ripening fruits from many orchards . Here and there a wayside crucifix rose dark against the sun ; here and there a chapel bell sounded from under some little peaked red roof . The cattle dozed beside meadow ditches that were choked with wild flowers ; the dogs lay down beside their sheep and slept . At the first cottage which she passed , the housewife sat out under a spreading chestnut tree , weaving lace upon her knee . Folle‐Farine looked wistfully at the woman , who was young and pretty , and who darted her swift skilled hand in and out around the bobbins , keeping time meanwhile with a mirthful burden that she sang . The woman looked up and frowned as the girl passed by her . A little way farther on there was winehouse by the roadside , built of wood , vine‐wreathed , and half hidden in the tall flowering briars of its garden . Out of the lattice there was leaning a maiden with the silver cross on her bosom shining in the sun , and her meek blue eyes smiling down from under the tower of her white cap . She was reaching a carnation to a student who stood below , with long fair locks and ruddy cheeks , and a beard yellow with the amber down of twenty years ; and who kissed her white wrist as he caught the red flower . Folle‐Farine glanced at the pretty picture with a dull wonder and a nameless pain : what could it mean to be happy like that ? Half a league onward she passed another cottage shadowed by a sycamore‐tree , and with the swallows whirling around its tall twisted stone chimneys , and a beurré pear covering with branch and bloom its old grey walls . An aged woman sat sipping coffee in the sun , and a young one was sweeping the blue and white tiles with a broom , singing gaily as she swept . “
36226	36264	36223	36224	my mother	1264	” she asked , pausing to look tenderly at the withered brown face , on which the shadows of the sycamore leaves were playing . The old mother smiled , steeping her bread in the coffee bowl . “
36279	36302	36269	36269	I	0	” She was happy though she was blind . Folle‐Farine stood a moment and looked at them across a hedge of honeysuckle . “
36320	36500	36501	36501	She	1267	” she thought ; and she went on her way through the poppies and corn , half softened , half enraged . Was she lower than they because she could find no one to care for her or take gladness in her life ? or was she greater than they because all human delights were to her as the dead letters of an unknown tongue ? Down a pathway fronting her , which ran midway between the yellowing seas of wheat and a belt of lilac clover , and over which a swarm of bees was murmuring , there came a country‐woman , crushing the herbage under her heavy shoes , ragged , picturesque , sunbrowned , swinging deep brass pails as she went to the herds on the hillside . She carried a child twisted into the folds of her dress ; a boy , half asleep , with his curly head against her breast . As she passed , the woman drew her kerchief over her bosom , and over the brown rosy face of the child . “
36511	36515	36501	36501	She	1267	” she muttered . “
36524	37724	36516	36516	Her	1267	” And she covered the child jealously , and turned aside , so that she should tread a separate pathway through the clover , and needed not to brush the garments of the one she was compelled to pass . Folle‐Farine heard , and laughed aloud . She knew of what the woman was thinking . In the summer of the previous year , as she had passed the tanyard on the western bank of the river , the tanner ’s little son , rushing out in haste , had curled his mouth in insult at her , and clapping his hands , hissed in a child ’s love of cruelty the mocking words which he had heard his elders use of her . In answer , she had only turned her head and looked down at him with calm eyes of scorn . But the child , running out fast , and startled by that regard , had slipped upon a shred of leather and had fallen heavily , breaking his left leg at the knee . The limb , unskilfully dealt with , and enfeebled by a tendency to disease , had never been restored , but hung limp , crooked , useless , withered from below the knee . Through all the country side the little cripple , Rémy , creeping out into the sun upon his crutches , was pointed out in a passionate pity as the object of her sorcery , the victim of her vengeance . When she had heard what they said she had laughed as she laughed now , drawing together her straight brows and showing her glistening teeth . All the momentary softness died in her now as the peasant covered the boy ’s face and turned aside into the clover . She laughed aloud , and swept on through the half‐ripe corn with that swift , harmonious , majestic movement which was inborn in her , as it is inborn in the deer or the antelope ; singing again as she went those strange wild airs , like the sigh of the wind , which were all the language which lingered in her memory from the land that had seen her birth . To such aversion as this she was too well used for it to be a matter of even notice to her . She knew that she was marked and shunned by the community amidst which her lot was cast ; and she accepted proscription without wonder and without resistance . Folle‐Farine : the Dust . What lower thing did earth hold ? In this old‐world district , amidst the pastures and cornlands of Normandy , superstition had taken a hold which the passage of centuries and the advent of revolution had done very little to lessen . Few of the people could read , and fewer still could write . They knew nothing but what their priests and their politicians told them to believe . They went to their beds with the poultry , and rose as the cock crew : they went to mass , as their ducks to the osier and weed ponds ; and to the conscription as their lambs to the slaughter . They understood that there was a world beyond them , but they remembered it only as the best market for their fruit , their fowls , their lace , their skins . Their brains were as dim as were their oil‐lit streets at night ; though their lives were content and mirthful , and for the most part pious . They went out into the summer meadows chaunting aves , in seasons of drought to pray for rain on their parching orchards , in the same credulity with which they groped through the winter fog , bearing torches and chaunting dirges to gain a blessing at seed time on their bleak black fallows . The beauty and the faith of the old Mediæval life were with them still ; and its faith were its bigotry and its cruelty likewise . They led simple and contented lives ; for the most part honest , and amongst themselves cheerful and kindly ; preserving much grace of colour , of costume , of idiosyncracy , because apart from the hueless communism and characterless monotony of modern cities . But they believed in sorcery and in devilry ; they were brutal to their beasts , and could be as brutal to their foes ; they were steeped in legend and tradition from their cradles ; and all the darkest superstitions of dead ages still found home and treasury in their hearts and at their hearths . Therefore , believing her a creature of evil , they were inexorable against her ; and thought that in being so they did their duty . They had always been a religious people in this birth country of the Flamma race ; the strong poetic reverence of their forefathers , which had symbolised itself in the carving of every lintel , corbel , or buttress in their streets , and in the fashion of every spire on which a weather‐vane could gleam against the sun , was still in their blood ; the poetry had departed , but the bigotry remained . Their ancestors had burned wizards and witches by the score in the open square of the cathedral place , and their grandsires and grandams had in brave , dumb , ignorant peasant fashion held fast to the lily and the cross , and gone by hundreds to the salutation of the axe and the baptism of the sword in the red days of revolution . They were the same people still ; industrious , frugal , peaceful , loyal , wedded to old ways and to old relics , content on little , and serene of heart ; yet , withal , where they feared or where they hated , brutal with the brutality begotten of abject ignorance . And they had been so to this outcast whom they all called Folle‐Farine . When she had first come amidst them , a little desolate foreign child , mute with the dumbness of an unknown tongue , and cast adrift amongst strange people , unfamiliar ways , and chill blank glances , she had shyly tried in a child ’s vague instincts of appeal and trust to make friends with the other children that she saw , and to share a little in the mothers ’ smiles and the babies ’ pastimes that were all around her in the glad green world of summer . But she had been denied and rejected with hard words and harder blows ; at her coming the smiles had changed to frowns , and the pastime into terror . She was proud , she was shy , she was savage ; she felt rather than understood that she was suspected and reviled ; she ceased to seek her own kind , and only went for companionship and sympathy to the creatures of the fields an the woods , to the things of the earth and the sky and the water . “
37732	37768	36516	36516	Her	1267	” half in sport hissed the youths in the market‐place against her as the little child went amongst them , carrying a load for her grandsire , heavier than her arms knew how to bear . “
37776	37816	37769	37769	Thou	1270	” said the old man himself , as she strained her small limbs to and fro the floors of his storehouses , carrying wood or flour or tiles or rushes , or whatever there chanced to need such convoy . “
37828	37873	37874	37875	The devil	4853	” hissed the six‐year old infants at play by the river when she waded in amidst them to reach with her lither arms the far‐off water‐flower which they were too timorous to pluck , and tendered it to the one who had desired it . “
37893	39382	37874	37875	The devil	4853	” muttered the old women , lifting a stick as she went near to their cattle in the meadows to brush off with a broad dockleaf the flies that were teasing the poor , meek , patient beasts . So , cursed when she did her duty and driven away when she tried to do good , her young soul had hardened itself and grown fierce , mute , callous , isolated . There were only the four‐footed things , so wise , so silent , so tender of heart , so bruised of body , so innocent , and so agonised , that had compassion for her , and saved her from utter desolation . In the mild sad gaze of the cow , in the lustrous suffering eyes of the horse , in the noble frank faith of the dog , in the soft bounding glee of the lamb , in the unwearied toil of the ass , in the tender industry of the bird , she had sympathy and she had example . She loved them and they loved her . She saw that they were sinless , diligent , faithful , devoted , loyal servers of base masters ; loving greatly , and for their love goaded , beaten , overtasked , slaughtered . She took the lesson to heart ; and hated men and women with a bitter hatred . So she had grown up for ten years , caring for no human thing , except in a manner for the old man Marcellin , who was , like her , proscribed . The priest had striven to turn her soul what they had termed heavenward ; but their weapons had been wrath and intimidation . She would have none of them . No efforts that they or her grandsire made had availed ; she would be starved , thrashed , cursed , maltreated as they would ; she could not understand their meaning , or would not submit herself to their religion . As years went on they found the contest hopeless , so had abandoned her to the devil , who had made her ; and the daughter of one whom the whole province had called saint had never passed within church‐doors or known the touch of holy water save when they had cast it on her as an exorcism . And when she met a priest in the open roads or on the byepaths of the fields , she always sang in loud defiance her wildest melodies . Where had she learnt these ? They had been sung to her by Phratos , and taught by him . Who had he been ? Her old life was obscure to her memory , and yet glorious even in that dimness . She did not know who those people had been with whom she had wandered , nor in what land they had dwelt . But that wondrous free life remained on her remembrance as a thing never to be forgotten or to be known again ; a life odorous with bursting fruits and budding flowers ; full of strangest and of sweetest music ; spent for ever under green leaves and suns that had no setting ; for ever beside fathomless waters and winding forests ; for ever rhymed to melody and soothed to the measure of deep winds and drifting clouds . For she had forgotten all except its liberty and its loveliness ; and the old gypsy life of the Liébana remained with her only as some stray fragment of an existence passed in another world from which she was now an exile , and revived in her only in the fierce passion of her nature , in her bitter , vague rebellion , in her longing to be free , in her anguish of vain desires for richer hues and bluer skies and wilder winds than those amidst which she toiled . At times she remembered likewise the songs and the melodies of Phratos ; remembered them when the moon rays swept across the white breadth of water lilies , or the breath of the spring stole through the awakening woods ; and when she remembered them she wept — wept bitterly , where none could look on her . She never thought of Phratos as a man ; as of one who had lived in a human form , and was now lying dead in an earthly grave . Her memory of him was as of some nameless creature half divine , whose footsteps brought laughter and music , with eyes bright as a bird ’s , yet sad as a dog ’s , and a voice for ever singing ; clad in goat ’s hair , gigantic and gay : a creature that had spoken tenderly to her , that had bidden her laugh and rejoice , that had carried her when she was weary ; that had taught her to sleep under the dewy leaves , and to greet the things of the night as soft sisters , and to fear nothing in the whole living world , in the earth , or the air , or the sky , and to tell the truth though a falsehood were to save the bare feet from flintstones , and naked shoulders from the stick , and an empty body from hunger and thirst . A creature that seemed to her in her memories even as the faun seemed to the fancies of the children of the Piræus ; a creature half man and half animal , glad and grotesque , full of mirth and of music , belonging to the forest , to the brook , to the stars , to the leaves , wandering like the wind , and , like the wind , homeless . This was all her memory ; but she cherished it ; in the face of the priests she bent her straight black brows and curled her scornful scarlet lips , but for the sake of Phratos she held one religion ; though she hated men she told them never a lie , and asked of them never alms . She went now along the white level roads , the empty basket balanced on her head , her form moving with the free harmonious grace of desert women , and she sang as she went the old sweet songs of the broken viol . She was friendless and desolate ; she was ill‐fed , she was heavily tasked ; she toiled without thanks ; she was ignorant of even so much knowledge as the peasants about her had ; she was without a past or a future , and her present had in it but daily toil and bitter words ; hunger , and thirst , and chastisement . Yet for all that she sang;—sang because the vitality in her made her dauntless of all evil ; because the abundant life opening in her made her glad in despite of fate ; because the youth , and the strength , and the soul that were in her could not utterly be brutalised , could not wholly cease from feeling the gladness of the sun , the coursing of the breeze , the liberty of nature , the sweet quick sense of living . Before long she reached the spot where the old man Marcellin was breaking his stones . His pile was raised much higher ; he sat astride on a log of timber and hammered the flints on and on , on and on , without looking up ; the dust , where the tramp of the people had raised it , was still thick on the leaves and the herbage ; and the prayers and the chaunts had failed as yet to bring the slightest cloud , the faintest rain mist , across the hot unbroken azure of the skies . Marcellin was her only friend ; the proscribed always adhere to one another ; when they are few they can only brood and suffer , harmlessly ; when they are many they rise as with one foot and strike as with one hand . Therefore , it is always perilous to make the lists of any proscription over long . The child , who was also an outcast , went to him and paused ; in a curious , lifeless , bitter way they cared for one another ; this girl who had grown to believe herself born of hell , and this man who had grown to believe that he had served hell . With the bastard Folle‐Farine and with the regicide Marcellin the people had no association , and for them no pity ; therefore they had found each other by the kinship of proscription ; and in a way there was love between them . “
39391	39414	39388	39388	you	1274	” said the old man to her as she passed him again on her homeward way , and paused again beside him . “
39421	39426	39388	39388	you	1274	” she answered him . “
39435	39436	39438	39438	they	1277	” “
39441	39479	39481	39481	they	1277	” She sat down a moment beside him , on the bank which was soft with moss , and odorous with wild flowers curling up the stems of the poplars and straying over into the corn beyond . “
39636	39637	39629	39629	you	1284	” “
39643	39663	39640	39640	you	0	” asked the old man , still breaking his stones with a monotonous rise and fall of his hammer . “
39674	39675	39664	39664	I	0	” “
39679	39680	39677	39677	he	1276	” “
39753	39754	39749	39749	he	1276	” “
39763	39900	39758	39758	you	1284	” Her eyes clouded ; she was mute . She vaguely knew the meaning it bore to herself , but it was beyond her to express it . All things of nature had voices and parables for her , because her fancy was vivid and her mind was dreamy ; but that mind was still too dark , and too profoundly ignorant , for her to be able to shape her thoughts into metaphor or deduction . The bird had spoken to her ; by his silence as by his song ; but what he had uttered she could not well utter again . Save , indeed , that song was not gladness , and neither was silence pain . Marcellin , although he had asked her , had asked needlessly ; for he also knew . “
39920	39945	39905	39905	you	1284	” he pursued , still echoing his words and hers by the ringing sound of the falling hammer . A smile curled her lips . “
39953	39958	39959	39959	They	4948	” she said carelessly . “
39989	39990	39971	39971	I	0	” “
39993	40028	39971	39971	I	0	” said the old man briefly , with a gleam of light over his harsh lean face . He looked up at her as he worked , the shivered flints flying right and left . “
40039	40051	40052	40053	A woman	4876	” he muttered , as his keen gaze swept over her . “
40055	40233	40052	40053	A woman	4876	” She echoed the words dully and half wonderingly ; she could not understand it in connection with herself . A woman ; that was a woman who sat in the sun under the fig tree , working her lace on a frame ; that was a woman who leaned out of her lattice tossing a red carnation to her lover ; that was a woman who swept the open porch of their house , singing as she cleared the dust away ; that was a woman who strode on her blithe way through the clover , carrying her child at her breast . She seemed to have no likeness to them , no kindred with them ; she , a beast of burden , a creature soulless and homeless ; an animal made to fetch and carry , to be cursed and beaten , to know neither love nor hope , neither past nor future , but only a certain dull patience and furious hate , a certain dim pleasure in labour and indifference to pain . “
40244	40252	40241	40242	a woman	4876	” said the old man once more . “
40322	40323	40316	40316	you	1293	” “
40326	40523	40524	40524	I	0	” She scarcely knew the meaning of the word . She saw that the female creatures round her were of all shades of age , from the young girls with their peach‐like cheeks to the old crones brown and withered as last year ’s nuts ; she knew that if she lived on she would be old likewise ; but of a future she had no conception , no ideal . She had been left too ignorant to have visions of any other world hereafter than this one which the low‐lying green hills and the arc of the pale blue sky shut in upon her . She had one desire , indeed — a desire vague yet fierce — the desire for liberty . But it was such desire as the bird which she had freed had known ; the desire of instinct , the desire of existence , only ; her mind was powerless to conceive a future , because a future is a hope , and of hope she knew nothing . The old man glanced at her , and saw that she had not comprehended . He smiled with a certain bitter pity . “
40528	40534	40524	40524	I	0	” he said to himself ; “
40545	40623	40624	40624	Women	365	“ Yet he saw that the creature who was so ignorant of her own powers , of her own splendours , of her own possibilities , had even now a beauty as great as that of a lustrous eastern‐eyed passion‐flower ; and he knew that to a woman who has such beauty as this the world holds out in its hand the tender of at least one future — one election , one kingdom , one destiny . “
40628	40633	40624	40624	Women	365	” she said suddenly ; “
40640	40645	40635	40636	any one	788	” Marcellin smiled bitterly . “
40675	40739	40663	40663	his	1304	” She was silent again , revolving his meaning ; it lay beyond her , both in the peril which it embodied from others , and the beauty in herself which it implied . She could reach no conception of herself , save as what she now was , a body servant of toil , a beast of burden like a young mule . “
40755	40763	40663	40663	his	1304	” she said , slowly and dreamily ; “
40777	40790	40663	40663	his	1304	” Marcellin smiled his grim and shadowy smile . He made answer — “
40793	40835	40663	40663	his	1304	” She sat mute once more , revolving this strange , brief word in her thoughts — strange to her , with a promise as vague , as splendid , and as incomprehensible as the prophecy of empire to a slave . “
40839	40846	40663	40663	his	1304	” she said , at last . “
40865	40866	40928	40928	they	1305	” “
40878	40891	40928	40928	they	1305	” muttered the old man , wearily cracking the flints in two ; “
40936	40984	40928	40928	they	1305	” Folle‐Farine listened , musing , with her hands clasped on the handles of her empty basket , and her chin resting upon them , and her eyes watching a maimed butterfly drag its wings of emerald and diamond through the hot , pale , sickly dust . “
40988	41011	40928	40928	they	1305	” she said , suddenly , as she stooped and lifted the wounded insect gently on to the edge of a leaf . “
41018	41022	41013	41013	I	0	” Marcellin smiled . “
41045	41046	41041	41041	poets	1314	” “
41052	41053	41049	41050	a poet	1315	” “
41094	41095	41049	41050	a poet	1315	” “
41098	41177	41049	41050	a poet	1315	” She was so accustomed to be told , that all she did was unlike to others , and was either wicked or was senseless , that she saw nothing except the simple statement of a fact in the rebuke which he had given her . She sat quiet , gazing down into the thick white dust of the road , bestirred by the many feet of mules and men that had trodden through it since the dawn . “
41183	41188	41178	41178	I	0	” she pursued slowly . “
41210	41211	41201	41201	I	0	” “
41230	41231	41233	41233	they	1318	” “
41257	41258	41233	41233	they	1318	” “
41290	41291	41294	41294	him	1324	” “
41311	41312	41303	41303	he	1324	” “
41332	41333	41334	41335	A woman	4876	” “
41337	41383	41334	41335	A woman	4876	” she repeated . The word seemed to have no likeness and no fitness with herself . A woman — she!—a creature made to be beaten , and worn at , and shunned , and loaded like a mule , and driven like a bullock ! “
41387	41408	41385	41385	you	1328	” said the old man , resting his hammer for a moment , and wiping the sweat from his brow . “
41515	41516	41507	41508	the devil	4853	” “
41527	41554	41520	41521	the devil	4853	” Marcellin leaned his hammer on his knee , and his voice rose clear and strong ; as it had rung of yore from the tribune . “
41591	41600	41587	41588	the devil	4853	“ That is his wisdom , see you . “
41626	41644	41645	41645	It	4853	“ The poor little weak soul is blind and astray in the busy streets of the world . “
41731	41745	41747	41752	the devil , who hearkens always	1343	“ It cries often , but God and man leave it to itself . “
41863	41912	41913	41913	He	1343	“ Then is the soul dazzled and captured , and made the devil ’s for evermore ; half through its innocence , half through its weakness ; but chiefly of all because God and man would not hear its cries while yet it was sinless and only astray . ”
42146	42155	42156	42156	she	1349	“ The soul ! What is the soul ? ”
42242	42243	42244	42244	I	0	” “
42265	42266	42262	42262	my	0	” “
42278	42286	42262	42262	my	0	” She freed it from his hand . “
42322	42323	42324	42324	You	1349	” “
42422	42423	42406	42408	Few great men	1365	” “
42429	42438	42406	42408	Few great men	1365	” he continued , breaking off his parable ; “
42464	42694	43574	43575	the gods	1366	” She nodded her head , and went ; he seldom used gentle words to her , and yet she knew , in a way , that he cared for her ; moreover , she rejoiced in that bitter , caustic contempt in which he , the oldest man amidst them , held all men . His words were the only thing that had aroused her dulled brain to its natural faculties ; in a manner , from him she had caught something of knowledge — something , too , of intellect ; he alone prevented her from sinking to that absolute unquestioning despair which surely ends in idiocy or in self‐murder . She pursued her way in silence across the fields , and along the straight white road , and across a wooden bridge that spanned the river , to her home . There was a gentler lustre in her eyes and her mouth had the faint light of a half smile upon it ; she did not know what hope meant ; it never seemed possible to her that her fate could be other than it was , since so long the messengers and emissaries of her father ’s empire had been silent and leaden‐footed to her call . Yet , in a manner , she was comforted , for had not two mouths that day bidden her “
42696	43570	43574	43575	the gods	1366	” ? She entered at length the little wood of Yprès , and heard that rush and music of the deep mill water , which was the sole thing she had learned to love in all the place . Beyond it were the apple orchards and fruit gardens which rendered Claudis Flamma back full recompense for the toil they cost him — recompense so large , indeed , that many disbelieved in that poverty which he was wo nt to aver weighed so hardly and so tightly on him . Both were now rich in all their mature abundance , since the stream which rushed through them had saved them from the evil effects of the long drought so severely felt in other districts . The cherry trees were scarlet with their latest fruit ; the great pumpkins glowed amongst their leaves in tawny orange heaps ; little russet‐breasted bullfinches beat their wings vainly at the fine network that enshrouded the paler gold of the wall apricots ; a grey cat was stealing amongst the delicate yellows of the pear‐shaped marrows ; where a round green wrinkled melon lay a‐ripening in the sun , a gorgeous dragon‐fly was hovering , and a mother‐mavis , in her simple coif of brown and white and grey , was singing with all the gladness of her sunny summer joys . Beyond a hedge of prickly thorn the narrower flower garden stretched , spanned by low stone walls , made venerable by the silvery beards of lichens ; and the whole earth was full of colour from the crimson and the golden gladioli ; from the carmine‐hued carnations ; from the deep‐blue lupins , and the Gloire de Dijon roses ; from the green slender stems , and the pure white cups , of the virginal lilies ; and from the gorgeous beetles , with their purple tunics and their shields of bronze , like Grecian hoplites in battle array . While everywhere , above this sweet glad garden world , the butterflies , purple and jewelled , the red‐starts in their ruby coats , the dainty azure‐winged blue‐warblers , the golden‐girdled wasp with his pinions light as mist , and the velvet‐coated bee with his pleasant harvest song , flew ever in the sunlight , murmuring , poising , praising , rejoicing . The place was beautiful in its own simple , quiet way ; lying in a hollow , where the river tumbled down in tow or three short breaks and leaps which broke its habitual smooth and sluggish form , and brought it in a sheet of dark water and with a million foam‐bells against the walls of the mill‐house and under the ponderous wheels . The wooden house itself also was picturesque , in the old fashion common when men built their dwellings slowly and for love ; with all its countless carvings black by age , its jutting beams shapen into grotesque human likeness and tragic masks ; its parquetted work run over by the green cups of stoneworks , and its high roof with deep shelving eave bright with diapered tiles of blue and white and rose , and alive all day with curling swallows , with pluming pigeons , with cooing doves . It was beautiful ; and the heart of Reine Flamma ’s young daughter doubtless would have clung to it , with all a child ’s instinct of love and loyalty to its home , had it not been to her only a prison‐house wherein three bitter gaolers for ever ruled her with a rod of iron — bigotry and penury and cruelty . She flung herself down a moment in the garden , on the long grass under a mulberry tree , ere she went in to give her account of the fruit sold and the monies brought by her . She had been on foot since four o’clock in the dawn of that sultry day ; her only meal had been a bowl or cold milk and a hunch of dry bread crushed in her strong small teeth . She always toiled hard at such bodily labour as was set to her ; to domestic work , to the work of the distaff and spindle , of the stove and the needle , they had never been able to break her ; they had found that she would be beaten black and blue ere she would be bound to it ; but against open air exertion she had never rebelled , and she had in her all the strength and the swiftness of the nomadic race of the Liébana , and had nought of their indolence and their dishonesty . She was very hungry , she was again thirsty ; yet she did not break off a fruit from any bough about her ; she did not steep her hot lips in any one of the cool juicy apricots which studded the stones of the wall beyond her . No one had ever taught her honesty , except indeed in that dim dead time when Phratos had closed her small hands in his whenever they had stretched out to some forbidden thing , and had said , “
43585	43762	43574	43575	the gods	1366	” And yet honest she was , by reason of the fierce proud savage independence in her , and her dim memories of that sole friend loved and lost . She wanted many a thing , many a time;—nay , nearly every hour that she lived , she wanted those sheer necessaries which make life endurable ; but she had taught herself to do without them rather than owe them by prayer or plunder to that human race which she hated , and to which she always doubted her own kinship . Buried in the grass , she now abandoned herself to the bodily delights of rest , of shade , of coolness , of sweet odours : the scent of the fruits and flowers was heavy on the air ; the fall of the water made a familiar tempestuous music on her ear ; and her fancy , poetic still , though deadened by a life of ignorance and toil , was stirred by the tender tones of the numberless birds that sang about her . “
43771	43937	43574	43575	the gods	1366	” she thought , as she lay there watching the dark leaves sway in the foam and the wind , and the bright‐bosomed birds float from blossom to blossom . For there was latent in her , all untaught , that old pantheistic instinct of the divine age , when the world was young , to behold a sentient consciousness in every leaf unfolded to the light ; to see a soul in every created thing the day shines on ; to feel the presence of an eternal life in every breeze that moves , in every grass that grows ; in every flame that lifts itself to heaven ; in every bell that vibrates on the air ; in every moth that soars to reach the stars . Pantheism is the religion of the poet ; and nature had made her a poet , though man as yet had but made of her an outcast , a slave , and a beast of burden . “
43946	44802	43574	43575	the gods	1366	” she thought , watching the sun‐rays pierce the purple heart of a passion‐flower , the shadows move across the deep brown water , the radiant butterfly alight upon a lily , the scarlet‐throated birds dart in and out , through the yellow feathery blossoms of the limes . All birds were her friends . Phratos had taught her in her infancy many notes of their various songs , and many ways and means of luring them to come and rest upon her shoulder and peck the berries in her hands . She had lived so much in the open fields and amongst the woods that she had made her chief companions of them . She could emulate so deftly all their voices , from the call of the wood dove to the chant of the blackbird , and from the trill of the nightingale to the twitter of the titmouse , that she could summon them all to her at will , and have dozens of them fluttering around her head and swaying their pretty bodies on her wrist . It was one of her ways that seemed to the peasantry so weird and magical ; and they would come home from their fields on a spring day‐break and tell their wives in horror how they had seen the devil ’s daughter in the red flush of the sunrise , ankle‐deep in violets , and covered with birds from head to foot , hearing their whispers , and giving them her messages to carry in return . One meek‐eyed woman had dared once to say that St. Francis had done as much , and it had been accredited to him as a fair action and virtuous knowledge ; but she was frowned down and chattered down by her louder neighbours , who told her that she might look for some sharp judgment of heaven for daring to couple together the blessed name of the holy saint and the accursed name of this foul spirit . But all they could say could not break the charmed communion between Folle‐Farine and her feathered companions . She loved them and they her . In the hard winter she had always saved some of her scanty meal for them , and in the springtime and the summer they always rewarded her with floods of songs and soft caresses from their nestling wings . There were no rare birds , no birds of moor and mountain , in that cultivated and populous district ; but to her all the little home‐bred things of pasture and orchard were full of poetry and of character . The robins , with that pretty air of boldness with which they veil their real shyness and timidity ; the strong and saucy sparrows , powerful by the strength of all mediocrities and majorities ; all the dainty families of finches in their gay apparellings ; the plain brown bird that filled the night with music ; the gorgeous oriole ruffling in gold , the gilded princeling of them all ; the little blue warblers , the violets of the air ; the kingfishers who had hovered so long over the forget‐me‐nots upon the rivers that they had caught the colours of the flowers on their wings ; the bright black‐caps green as the leaves , with their yellow waistcoats and velvet hoods , the innocent freebooters of the woodland liberties : all these were her friends and lovers , various as any human crowds of court or city . She loved them ; they and the fourfooted beasts were the sole things that did not flee from her ; and the woeful and mad slaughter of them by the peasants was to her a grief passionate in its despair . She did not reason on what she felt ; but to her a bird slain was a trust betrayed , an innocence defiled , a creature of heaven struck to earth . Suddenly on the silence of the garden there was a little shrill sound of pain ; the birds flew high in air , screaming and startled ; the leaves of a bough of ivy shook as with a struggle . She rose and looked ; a line of twine was trembling against the foliage ; in its noosed end the throat of the mavis had been caught ; it hung tremblingly and clutching at the air convulsively with its little drawn up feet . It had flown into the trap as it had ended its joyous song and soared up to join its brethren . There were a score of such traps set in the miller ’s garden . She unloosed the cord from about its tiny neck , set it free , and laid it down upon the ivy : the succour came too late ; the little gentle body was already without breath ; the feet had ceased to beat the air ; the small soft head had drooped feebly on one side ; the lifeless eyes had started from their sockets ; the throat was without song for evermore . “
44812	45108	43574	43575	the gods	1366	” she thought , as she stood with the little dead bird in her hand . Its mate , which was poised on a rose bough , flew straight to it , and curled round and round about the small slain body , and piteously bewailed its fate , and mourned , refusing to be comforted , agitating the air with trembling wings , and giving out vain cries of grief . Vain ; for the little joyous life was gone ; the life that asked only of God and Man a home in the green leaves ; a drop of dew from the cup of a rose ; a bough to swing on in the sunlight ; a summer day to celebrate in song . All the winter through , it had borne cold and hunger and pain without lament ; it had saved the soil from destroying larvæ , and purified the trees from all foul germs ; it had built its little home unaided , and had fed its nestlings without alms ; it had given its sweet song lavishly to the winds , to the blossoms , to the empty air , to the deaf ears of men ; and now it lay dead in its innocence ; trapped and slain because human greed begrudge it a berry worth the thousandth part of a copper coin . Out from the porch of the mill‐house Claudis Flamma came , with a knife in his hand and a basket , to cut lilies for one of the choristers of the cathedral , since the morrow would be the religious feast of the Visitation of Mary . He saw the dead thrush in her hand , and chuckled to himself as he went by . “
45116	45347	43574	43575	the gods	1366	” he said , thinking how shrewd and how sure in their make were these traps of twine that he set in the grass and the leaves . She said nothing ; but the darkness of disgust swept over her face , as he came in sight in the distance . She knelt down and scraped a hole in the earth ; and laid moss in it and put the mavis softly on its green and fragrant bier , and covered it with handsful of fallen rose leaves and with a spring or two of thyme . Around her head the widowed thrush flew ceaselessly , uttering sad cries;—who now should wander with him through the sunlight?—who now should rove with him above the blossoming fields?—who now should sit with him beneath the boughs hearing the sweet rain fall between the leaves?—who now should wake with him whilst yet the world was dark , to feel the dawn break , ere the east were red , and sing a welcome to the unborn day ? MEANWHILE Claudis Flamma cut the lilies for the cathedral altars , muttering many holy prayers as he gathered the flowers of Mary . When the white lily sheaves had been borne away , kept fresh in wet moss , by the young chorister who had been sent for them , the miller turned to her . “
45353	45473	43574	43575	the gods	1366	” She , standing beside the buried bird , undid the leathern thong about her waist , opened the pouch , and counted out the coins , one by one , on the flat stone of a water tank amongst the lilies and the ivy . There were a few silver pieces of slight value and some dozens of copper ones . The fruit had been left at various stalls and houses in small portions , for it was the custom to supply it fresh each day . He caught them up with avidity , bit and tested each , counted them again and again , and yet again ; after the third enumeration he turned sharply on her . “
45488	45489	45483	45483	you	1373	” “
45496	45502	45483	45483	you	1373	” she answered him curtly . “
45514	45515	45483	45483	you	1373	” “
45522	45523	45483	45483	you	1373	” “
45530	45531	45483	45483	you	1373	” “
45559	45560	45538	45538	I	0	” “
45565	45566	45567	45567	They	1375	” “
45594	45595	45588	45588	he	1376	” “
45599	45600	45601	45601	You	1373	” “
45630	45631	45618	45618	You	1373	” “
45641	45642	45632	45632	I	0	” “
45651	45652	45653	45653	I	0	” “
45670	45671	45662	45662	I	0	” “
45681	45704	45672	45672	Wretch	144	” A smile careless and sarcastic curled her mouth ; her eyes looked at him with all their boldest , fiercest lustre . “
45717	45718	45719	45719	You	1373	” “
45724	45745	45719	45719	You	1373	” he shrieked , his thin and feeble voice rising in fury at his lost coins and his discovered treachery . “
45859	45870	45851	45851	I	0	” She laughed a hard , scornful , reckless laughter . “
45884	45885	45886	45886	You	1373	” “
45894	45895	45886	45886	You	1373	” “
45908	45909	45910	45910	You	1373	” “
45920	45921	45910	45910	You	1373	” “
45929	45930	45910	45910	You	1373	” “
45934	46474	45910	45910	You	1373	” She set her teeth in silence ; and without a moment ’s hesitation unloosened the woollen sash knotted round her waist , and pushed down the coarse linen tunic from about her throat . The white folds fell from off the perfect curves of her brown arms , and left bare her shining shoulders , beautiful as any sculptured Psyche ’s . She was not conscious of degradation in her punishment ; she had been bidden to bow her head and endure the lash from the earliest years she could remember . According to the only creed she knew , silence and fortitude and strength were the greatest of all virtues . She stood now in the cross lights among the lilies as she had stood when a little child , erect , unquailing , and ready to suffer ; insensible of humiliation because unconscious of sin ; and so tutored by severity and exposure that she had as yet none of the shy shame and the fugitive shrinking of her sex . She had only the boldness to bear , the courage to be silent , which she had had when she had stood amongst the same tall lilies , in the same summer radiance , in the years of her helpless infancy . She uncovered herself to the lash as a brave hound crouches to it ; not from inborn cowardice , but simply from the habit of obedience and of endurance . He had used her as the Greeks the Helots ; he always beat her , when she was at fault , to teach her to be faultless ; and , when without offence , beat her to remind her that she was the offspring of humiliation , and a slave . He took , as he had taken in an earlier time , a thick rope which lay coiled upon the turf ready for the binding of some straying boughs ; and struck her with it , slowly . His arm had lost somewhat of its strength , and his power was unequal to his will . Still rage for the loss of his copper pieces , and the sense that she had discovered the fraudulent intention of his small knavery , lent force to his feebleness ; as the scourge whistled through the air and descended on her shoulders it left bruised , swollen marks to stamp its passage , and curling , adder‐like , bit and drew blood . Yet to the end she stood mute and motionless , as she had stood in her childhood ; not a nerve quivered , not a limb flinched : the colour rushed over her bent face and her bare chest , but she never made a movement ; she never gave a sound . When his arm dropped from sheer exhaustion , she still said not one word ; she drew tight once more the sash about her waist , and fastened afresh the linen of her bodice . The bruised and wounded flesh smarted and ached and throbbed ; but she was used to such pain , and bore it as their wounds were borne by the women of the Spartan games . “
46483	46490	46475	46475	Your	1385	” he muttered with a smile . “
46524	46699	46516	46517	the mule	1386	” She did not go within to eat ; the bruises and the burning of her skin made her feel sick and weak . She went away and cast herself at full length in the shade of the long grasses of the orchard ; resting her chin upon her hands , cooling her aching breast against the soft damp moss ; thinking , thinking , thinking , of what she hardly knew , except , indeed , that she wished that she were dead , like the bird she had covered with the leaves . He did not leave her long to even so much peace as this ; his shrill voice soon called her from her rest ; he bade her get ready the mule and go . She obeyed . The animal was saddled with his wooden pack ; as many sacks as he could carry were piled upon the framework ; she put her hand upon his bridle , and set out to walk to Barbizène which was two leagues away . “
46716	47365	46475	46475	Your	1385	” muttered the miller , as he watched the old mule pace down the narrow , tree‐shadowed road that led across the fields : and he believed that he did rightly in this treatment of her . It gratified the sharp hard cruelty of temper in him , indeed , but he did not think that in such self‐indulgence he ever erred . He was a bitter , cunning , miserly old man , whose solitary tenderness of feeling and honesty of pride had been rooted out for ever when he had learned the dishonour of the woman whom he had deemed a saint . In the ten years of time which had passed since first the little brown large‐eyed child had been sent to seek asylum with him , he had grown harder and keener and more severe with each day that rose . Her presence was abhorrent to him , though he kept her , partly from a savage sense of duty , partly from the persuasion that she had the power in her to make the strongest and the cheapest slave he had ever owned . For the rest , he sincerely and devoutly believed that the devil , in some witchery of human guise , had polluted his daughter ’s body and soul , and that it was by the foul fiend and by no earthly lover that she had conceived and borne the creature who now abode with him . Perhaps , also , as was but natural , he sometime felt more furious against this offspring of hell because ever and again some gleam of fantastic inborn honour , some strange savage instinct of honesty , would awake in her and oppose him , and make him ashamed of those small and secret sins of chicanery wherein his soul delighted , and for which he compounded with his gods . He had left her mind a blank , because he thought the body laboured hardest when the brain was still asleep , which is true ; she could not read ; she could not write ; she knew absolutely nothing . Yet there was a soul awake in her ; there were innumerable thoughts and dreams brooding in her fathomless eyes ; there was a desire in her , fierce and unslaked , for some other life than this life of the packhorse and of the day labourer which alone she knew . He had done his best to degrade and to brutalise her , and in much he had succeeded ; but he had not succeeded wholly . There was a liberty in her that escaped his thraldom ; there was a soul in her that resisted the deadening influence of her existence . She had none of the shame of her sex ; she had none of the timorous instincts of womanhood . She had a savage stubborn courage , and she was insensible of the daily outrages of her life . She would strip bare to his word obediently , feeling only that it would be feeble and worthless to dread the pain of the lash . She would bathe in the woodland pool , remembering no more that she might be watched by human eyes than does the young tigress that has never beheld the face of man . In all this she was brutalised and degraded by her tyrant ’s bondage : in other things she was far higher than he , and escaped him . Stupefied as her mind might be by the exhaustion of severe physical labour , it had still irony and it had still imagination ; and under the hottest heats of temptation there were two things which by sheer instinct she resisted , and resisted so that neither of them had ever been forced on her — they were falsehood and fear . “
47375	48844	46475	46475	Your	1385	” said Claudis Flamma , when he found that he could not force her to deviate from the truth . The world says the same of those who will not feed it with lies . THAT long dry summer was followed by an autumn of drought and scarcity . The prayers of the priests and peoples failed to bring down rain . The wooden Christs gazed all day long on parching lands and panting cattle . Even the broad deep rivers shrank and left their banks to bake and stink in the long drought . The orchards sickened for lack of moisture , and the peasants went about with feverish faces , ague‐stricken limbs , and trembling hearts . The corn yielded ill in the hard scorched ground , and when the winter came it was a time of dire scarcity and distress . Claudis Flamma and a few others like him alone prospered . The mill‐house at Yprès served many purposes . It was a granary , a market , a baker ’s shop , an usurer ’s den , all in one . It looked a simple and innocent place . In the summer time it was peaceful and lovely , green and dark and still , with the blue sky above it , and the songs of birds all around ; with its old black timbers , and its many‐coloured orchards , and its pretty leafy gardens , and its grey walls washed by the hurrying stream . But in the winter it was very dreary , utterly lonely . The water roared , and the leafless trees groaned in the wind , and the great leaden clouds of rain or fog enveloped it duskily . To the starving , wet , and woe‐begone peasants who would go to it with aching bones and aching hearts , it seemed desolate and terrible . They dreaded with a great dread the sharp voice of its master — the hardest and the shrewdest and the closest fisted Norman of them all . For they were most of them his debtors , and so were in a bitter subjugation to him , and had to pay those debts as best they might with their labour or their suffering ; with the best of all their wool , or oil , or fruit ; often with the last bit of silver that had been an heirloom for five centuries , or with the last bit of money buried away in an old pitcher under their apple tree to be the nest egg of their little pet daughter ’s dowry . And yet Claudis Flamma was respected among them ; for he could outwit them , and was believed to be very wealthy , and was a man who stood well with the good saints and with holy Church:—a wise man , in a word , with whom these northern folks had the kinship of mutual industry and avarice . For the most part the population around Yprès was thrifty and thriving in a cautious , patient , certain way of well‐doing ; and , by this portion of it , the silent old miser was much honoured as man laborious and penurious , who chose to live on a leek and a rye loaf , but who must have , it was well known , put by large gains in the thatch of his roof or under the bricks of his kitchen . By the smaller section of it — poor , unthrifty , loose‐handed fools — who belied the province of their birth so far as to be quick to spend and slow to save , and who therefore fell into want and famine and had to borrow of others their children ’s bread , the old miller was hated with a hate deeper and stronger because forced to be mute , and to submit , to cringe , and to be trod upon , in the miserable servitude of the hopeless debtor . In the hard winter which followed on that sickly autumn these and their like fell farther in the mire of poverty than ever , and had to come and beg of Flamma loans of the commonest necessaries of their bare living . They knew that they would have to pay a hundredfold in horrible extortion when the spring and summer should bring them work , and give them fruit on their trees and crops on their little fields ; but they could do no better . It had been for many years the custom to go to Flamma in such need ; and being never quit of his hold , his debtors never could try for aid elsewhere . The weather towards the season of Noel became frightfully severe ; the mill stream never stopped , but all around it was frozen , and the swamped pastures were sheets of ice . The birds died by thousands in the open country , and several of the sheep perished in snow storms on the higher lands . There was dire want in many of the hovels and homesteads , and the bare harvests of a district , usually so opulent in the riches of the soil , brought trouble and dearth in their train . Sickness prevailed because the old people and the children in their hunger ate berries and roots unfit for human food ; the waters swelled , the ice melted , and many homes were flooded , and some even swept away . Old Pitchou and Claudis Flamma alone were content ; the mill wheel never stopped work , and famine prices could be asked for in this extremity . Folle‐Farine worked all that winter , day after day , month after month , with scarcely a word being spoken to her , or scarcely an hour being left her that she could claim as her own . She looked against the snow as strangely as a scarlet rose blossoming in frost there could have done ; but the people that came to and fro , even the young men amongst them , were too used to that dark vivid silent face of hers , and those lithe brown limbs that had the supple play and the golden glow of the East in them , to notice them as any loveliness ; and if they did note them on some rare time , thought of them only as the marks of a vagrant and accursed race . She was so unlike to themselves that the northern peasantry never dreamed of seeing beauty in her ; they turned their heads away when she went by , striding after her mule or bearing her pitcher from the well with the free and vigorous grace of a mountain or desert‐born creature . The sheepskin girt about her loins , the red kerchief knotted to her head , the loose lithe movements of her beautiful limbs , the sullen fire and fierce dreams in her musing eyes,—all these were so unlike themselves that they saw nothing in them except what was awful or unlovely . Half the winter went by without a kind word to her from any one except such as in that time of suffering and scarcity Marcellin spoke to her . So had every winter gone since she had come there — a time so long ago that the memory of Phratos had become so dim to her that she often doubted if he also were not a mere shadow of a dream like all the rest . Half the winter she fared hardly and ate sparingly , and did the work of the mule and the bullocks : indifferent and knowing no better , and only staring at the stars when they throbbed in the black skies on a frosty night , and wondering if she would ever go to them , or if they would ever come to her — those splendid and familiar yet unknown things that looked on all the misery of the earth , and shone on tranquilly and did not seem to care . Time came close on to the new year , and the distress and the cold were together at their height . The weather was terrible ; and the poor suffered immeasurably . A score of times a‐day she heard them ask bread at the mill , and a score of time saw them given a stone ; she saw them come in the raw fog , pinched and shivering , and sick with ague , and she saw her grandsire deny them with a grating sarcasm or two , or take from them fifty times its value for some niggard grant of food . “
48857	49398	49403	49403	myself	0	” she said to herself ; and yet she did both , and could not help it . There was among the sufferers one old and poor , who lived not far from the mill , by name Manon Dax . She was a little old hardy brown woman , shrivelled and bent , yet strong , with bright eyes like a robin ’s , and a tough frame , eighty years old . She had been southern born , and the wife of a stone cutter ; he had been dead fifty years , and she had seen all her sons and daughters and their offspring die too ; and had now , left on her hand to rear , four young great‐grandchildren , almost infants , who were always crying to her for food as new‐born birds cry in their nests . She washed a little , when she could get any linen to wash , and she span , and she picked up the acorns and the nuts , and she tilled a small plot of ground that belonged to her hut , and she grew cabbages and potatoes and herbs on it , and so kept a roof over her head , and fed her four nestlings , and trotted to and fro in her wooden shoes all day long , and worked in hail and rain , in drought and tempest , and never complained , but said that God was good to her . She was anxious about the children , knowing she could not live long — that was all . But then she felt sure that the Mother of God would take care of them , and so was cheerful ; and did what the day brought her to do , and was content . Now on Manon Dax , as on thousands of others , the unusual severity of the winter fell like a knife . She was only one amongst thousands . Nobody noticed her ; still it was hard . All the springs near her dwelling were frozen for many weeks ; there was no well nearer than half a league ; and half a league out and half a league back every other day over ground sharp and slippery with ice , with two heavy pails to carry , is not a little when one is over eighty , and has only a wisp of woollen serge between the wind and one ’s withered limbs . The acorns and horse‐chestnuts had all been disputed with her fiercely by boys rough and swift , who foresaw a time coming in which their pigs would be ill‐fed . The roots in her little garden plot were all black and killed by the cold . The nettles had been all gathered and stewed and eaten . The snow drove in through a big hole in her roof . The woods were ransacked for every bramble and broken bough by reivers younger and more agile than herself ; she had nothing to eat , nothing to burn . The children lay in their little beds of hay and cried all day long for food , and she had none to give them . “
49405	49634	49403	49403	myself	0	” she thought , stopping her ears not to hear them ; if it had been only herself it would have been so easy to creep away into the corner among the dry grass , and to lie still till the cold froze the pains of hunger and made them quiet ; and to feel numb and tired , and yet glad that it was all over , and to murmur that God was good , and so to let death come — content . But it was not only herself . The poor are seldom so fortunate — they themselves would say so unhappy — as to be alone in their homes . There were the four small lives left to her by the poor dead foolish things she had loved,—small lives that had been rosy even on so much hunger , and blithe even amidst so much cold ; that had been mirthful even at the flooding of the snowdrift , and happy even over a meal of mouldy crusts , or of hips and haws from the hedges . Had been — until now , when even so much as this could not be got , and when their beds of hay were soaked through with snow‐water ; now — when they were quite silent , except when they sobbed out a cry for bread . “
49665	49839	49840	49840	I	0	” she thought , sitting by her black hearth , across which the howling wind drove , and stopping her ears to shut out the children ’s cries . She had often known severe winters , scanty food , bitter living,—she had scores of times in her long years been as famished as this , and as cold , and her house had been as desolate . Yet she had borne it all and never asked for an alms , being strong and ignorant , and being also in fear of the world , and holding a debt a great shame . But now she knew that she must do it , or let those children perish ; being herself old and past work , and having seen all her sons die out in their strength before her . The struggle was long and hard with her . She would have to die soon , she knew , and she had striven all her lifetime so to live that she might die saying , “
49848	49922	49840	49840	I	0	” This perhaps , she thought sadly , had been only a pride after all ; a feeling foolish and wicked , that the good God sought now to chasten . Any way she knew that she must yield it up and go and ask for something ; or else those four small things , that were like a cluster of red berries on a leafless tree , must suffer and must perish . “
49933	49937	49928	49928	I	0	” she thought . “
49992	50039	50043	50044	my treasures	1395	” And she rose up on her bent stiff limbs , and went to the pile of hay on which the children were lying , pale and thin , but trying to smile , all of them , because they saw the tears on her cheeks . “
50046	50069	50070	50070	I	0	” she said to them , striving to speak cheerily , and laying her hands on the curls of the eldest born ; “
50099	50130	50131	50131	I	0	” Bernardou promised , being four years old himself ; and she crept out of the little black door of the hut into the white road and the rushing winds . “
50137	50482	50131	50131	I	0	” she said to herself . It was three in the afternoon , nearly dark at the season of midwinter . The business of the day was done . The people had come and gone , favoured or denied , according to such sureties as they could offer . The great wheel worked on in the seething water ; the master of the mill sat against the casement to catch the falling light , adding up the sums in his ledger — crooked little signs such as he had taught himself to understand , though he could form neither numerals nor letters with his pen . All around him in the storehouses there were corn , wood , wool , stores of every sort of food . All around him , in the room he lived in , there were hung the salt meats , the sweet herbs , and the dried fruits , that he had saved from the profusion of other and healthier years . It pleased him to know that he held all that , and also withheld it . It moved him with a certain saturnine glee to see the hungry wistful eyes of the peasants stare longingly at all those riches , whilst their white lips faltered out an entreaty — which he denied . It was what he liked ; to sit there and count his gains after his fashion , and look at his stores and listen to the howling wind and driving hail , and to chuckle to think how lean and cold and sick they were outside — those fools who had mocked him because his saint had been a gipsy ’s leman . To be prayed to for bread , and give the stone of a bitter denial ; to be implored with tears of supplication , and to answer with a grim jest ; to see a woman come with children dying for food , and to point out to her the big brass pans full of milk , and say to her , “
50490	51063	51064	51064	Flamma	115	” and then to see her go away wailing and moaning that her child would die , and tottering feebly through the snow — all this was sweet to him . Before his daughter had gone from him , he had been , though a hard man , yet honest , and had been , though severe , not cruel ; but since he had been aware of the shame of the creature whom he had believed in as an angel , every fibre in him had been embittered and salted sharp with the poignancy of an acrid hate towards all living things . To hurt and to wound , and to see what he thus struck bleed and suffer , was the only pleasure life had left for him . He had all his manhood walked justly , according to his light , and trusted in the God to whom he prayed ; and his God and his trust had denied and betrayed him , and his heart had turned to gall . The old woman toiled slowly through the roads which lay between her hut and the water‐mill . They were roads which passed through meadows and along corn‐fields , beside streamlets , and amongst little belts of woodland , lanes and paths green and pleasant in the summer , but now a slough of frozen mud , and whistled through by north‐east winds . She held on her way steadily , stumbling often , and often slipping and going slowly , for she was very feeble from long lack of food , and the intensity of the cold drove through and through her frame . Still she held on , bravely , in the teeth of the rough winds and of the coming darkness , though the weather was so wild that the poplar trees were bent to the earth , and the little light in the Calvary lamp by the river blew to and fro , and at last died out . Still she held on , a little dark tottering figure , with a prayer on her lips and a hope in her heart . The snow was falling , the clouds were driving , the waters were roaring in the twilight : she was only a little black speck in the vast grey waste of the earth and the sky , and the furious air tossed her at times to and fro like a withered leaf . But she would not let it beat her ; she groped her way with infinite difficulty , grasping a bough for strength , or waiting under a tree for breath a moment , and thus at last reached the mill‐house . Such light as there was left showed her the kitchen within , the stores of wood , the strings of food ; it looked to her as it had looked to Phratos , a place of comfort and of plenty ; a strong safe shelter from the inclement night . She lifted the latch and crept in , and went straight to Claudis Flamma , who was still busy beneath the window with those rude signs which represented to him his earthly wealth . She stood before him white from the falling snow , with her brown face working with a strong emotion , her eyes clear and honest , and full of an intense anxiety of appeal . “
51066	51073	51064	51064	Flamma	115	” she said simply to him , “
51178	51219	51172	51172	I	0	” He shut his ledger , and looked at her . They had been neighbours , as she had said , half a century and more ; and had often knelt down before the same altar , side by side . “
51224	51229	51172	51172	I	0	” he asked simply . “
51232	51237	51172	51172	I	0	” she made answer ; “
51251	51252	51242	51242	They	1403	” “
51259	51263	51242	51242	They	1403	” he asked . “
51360	51444	51348	51348	I	0	” Claudis Flamma got up and walked to the other side of the kitchen . Her eyes followed him with wistful , hungry longing . Where he went there stood pans of new milk , baskets of eggs , rolls of bread , piles of faggots . Her feeble heart beat thickly with eager hope , her dim eyes glowed with pleasure and with thankfulness . He came back and brought to her a few sharp rods , plucked from a thorn tree . “
51453	51462	51348	51348	I	0	” he said , with a dark smile . “
51482	51501	51505	51505	you	115	” She looked at him startled and disquieted , yet thinking that he meant but a stern jest . “
51509	51515	51505	51505	you	115	” she murmured , trembling ; “
51557	51570	51571	51571	I	0	” He smiled , and answered her in this harsh grating voice , “
51592	51626	51627	51627	You	115	” She reeled a little as if he had struck her a blow with his fist , and her face changed terribly , whilst her eyes stared without light or sense in them . “
51636	51640	51632	51632	You	115	” she muttered . “
51673	51674	51663	51663	I	0	” “
51687	51956	51957	51958	The children	452	” he answered her , with the habitual lie of the miser ; and he opened his ledger again , and went on counting up the dots and crosses by which he kept his books . His servant Pitchou sat spinning by the hearth : she did not cease her work , nor intercede by a word . The poor can be better to the poor than any princes ; but the poor can also be more cruel to the poor than any slave drivers . The old woman ’s head dropped on her breast , she turned feebly , and felt her way , as though she were blind , out of the house and into the air . It was already dark with the darkness of descending night . The snow was falling fast . Her hope was gone : all was cold — cold as death . She shivered and gasped , and strove to totter on : the children were alone . The winds blew and drove the snow flakes in a white cloud against her face ; the bending trees creaked and groaned as though in pain ; the roar of the mill‐water filled the air . There was now no light : the day was gone , and the moon was hidden ; beneath her feet the frozen earth cracked and slipped and gave way . She fell down ; being so old and so weakly she could not rise again , but lay still with one limb broken under her , and the winds and the storm beating together upon her . “
51963	52076	51960	51961	the children	452	” she moaned feebly , and then was still : she was so cold , and the snow fell so fast ; she could not lift herself nor see what was around her ; she thought that she was in her bed at home , and felt as though she would soon sleep . Through the dense gloom around her there came a swiftly moving shape , that flew as silently and as quickly as a night bird , and paused as though on wings beside her . A voice that was at one timid and fierce , tender and savage , spoke to her through the clouds of driven snow spray . “
52147	52148	52129	52129	he	115	” “
52155	52234	52129	52129	he	115	” The blessed word aroused her from her lethargy ; she raised herself a little on one arm , and tried to see whence the voice came that spoke to her . But the effort exhausted her ; she fell again to the ground with a groan — her limb was broken . Folle‐Farine stood above her ; her dark eyes gleaming like a hawk ’s through the gloom , and full of a curious , startled pity . “
52245	52251	52241	52241	you	104	” she said , abruptly . “
52281	52319	52325	52325	I	0	” She spoke hastily and roughly ; she was ashamed of her own compassion . What was it to her , whether any of these people lived or died ? They had always mocked and hated her . “
52337	52465	52325	52325	I	0	” she thought , with the ferocity of vengeance that ran in her oriental blood . Yet she had come out in the storm , and had brought away her food for strangers , though she had been at work all day long , and was chilled to the bone , and was devoured with a ravenous hunger . Why did she do it ? She did not know . She scorned herself . But she was sorry for this woman , so poor and brave , with her eighty‐two years , and so bitterly denied in her extremity . Manon Dax dimly caught the muttered words , and feebly strove to answer them , whilst the winds roared and the snow beat upon her fallen body . “
52471	52475	52325	52325	I	0	” she murmured ; “
52545	52834	52836	52836	you	1427	” Folle‐Farine stood in silence a moment , then she stooped and lifted the old creature in her strong young arms , and with that heavy burden set out on her way in the teeth of the storm . She had known the woman , and the little ones , by sight and name long and well . Once or twice when she had passed by them , the grandam , tender of heart , but narrow of brain , and believing all the tales of her neighbours , had drawn the children closer to her , under the wing of her serge cloak , lest the evil eye that had bewitched the tanner ’s youngest born , should fall on them , and harm them in like manner . Nevertheless the evil eyes gleamed on her with a wistful sorrow , as Folle‐Farine bore her with easy strength and a sure step , through the frozen woodland ways , as she would have borne the load of wood , or the sack of corn , which she was so well used to carry to and fro like a packhorse . Manon Dax did not stir , she did not even strive to speak again ; she was vaguely sensible of a slow , buoyant , painless movement , of a close soft pressure that sheltered her from the force of the winds , of a subtle warmth that stole through her emaciated aching frame , and made her drowsy and forgetful , and content to be still . She could do no more . Her day for struggle and for work was done . Once she moved a little . Her bearer paused and stopped and listened . “
52839	52848	52836	52836	you	1427	” Manon Dax gave a soft troubled sigh . “
52853	52918	52849	52849	God	118	” she muttered , like one speaking in a dream . Folle‐Farine held on her way , as before her Phratos had once held on his ; fiercely blown , blinded by the snow , pierced by the blasts of the hurricane , but sure of foot on the ice as a reindeer , and sure of eye in the dark as a night‐hawk . “
52924	52939	52940	52940	She	1428	” she asked once of the burden she carried . There was no answer . “
52944	53158	52940	52940	She	1428	” she thought ; and went onward . The distance of the road was nothing to her , fleet and firm of step , and inured to all hardships of the weather ; yet it cost her an hour to travel it , heavily weighted as she was , soaked with snow‐water , blown back continually by the opposing winds , and forced to stagger and to pause by the fury of the storm . At last she reached the hut . The wind had driven open the door . The wailing cries of the children echoed sorrowfully on the stillness , answered by the bleating of sheep , cold and hungry in their distant folds . The snow had drifted in unchecked ; all was quite dark . She felt her way within over the heaps of the snow , and being used by long custom to see in the gloom , as the night‐haunting beasts and birds can see , she found the bed of hay , and laid her burden gently down on it . The children ceased their wailing ; the two eldest ones crept up close to their grandmother ; and pressed their cheeks to hers , and whispered to her eagerly , with their little famished lips : “
53169	53249	53250	53250	God	118	” But there was still no answer . The clouds drifted a little from the moon which had been so long obscured ; it shone for a moment through the vapour of the heavy sky ; the whitened ground threw back the rays increased tenfold ; the pale gleam reached the old still face of Manon Dax . There was a feeble smile upon it — the smile with which her last words had been spoken in the darkness ; “
53254	53515	53516	53516	They	1429	” She was quite dead . ALL that night Folle‐Farine tarried with the children . The youngest had been suffocated whilst they had been alone , by the snow that had fallen through the roof , from which its elders had been too small and weakly to be able to drag it out , unaided . She laid it , stiff already in the cold night , beside the body of its old grandam , who had perished in endeavouring to save it ; they lay together , the year‐old child and the aged woman , the broken bud and the leafless bough . They had died of hunger , as the birds die on the moors and plains ; it is a common fate . She stayed beside the children , who were frightened and bewildered and quite mute . She divided such food as she had brought between them , not taking any herself . She took off the sheepskin which she wore in winter tied round her loins as her outdoor garment , and made a little nest of it for the three , and covered them with it . She could not close the door , from the height of the drifted snow , and the wind poured in all night long , though in an hour the snow ceased to fall . Now and then the clouds parting a little , let a ray of the moon stray in ; and then she could see the quiet faces of the old woman and the child . “
53532	53690	53522	53522	they	1429	” she thought ; and she pondered on it deeply , with the bitter and melancholy irony which life had already taught her . The hours of the night dragged slowly on ; the winds howled above the trembling hovel ; the children sobbed themselves to sleep at last , lulled by the warmth of the sheepskin , in which they crept together like young birds in a nest . She sat there patiently ; frozen and ravenous ; yet not drawing a corner of the sheepskin to her own use , nor regretting a crumb of the bread she had surrendered . She hated the human race , whose hand was always against her . She had no single good deed to thank them for , nor any single gentle word . Yet she was sorry for that old creature , who had been so bitterly dealt with all her years through , who had died saying “
53695	54007	53691	53691	God	118	” She was sorry for those little helpless , unconscious starving animals , who had lost the only life that could labour for theirs . She forgave — because she forgot — that in other winters this door had been shut against her as against an accursed thing , and these babes had mocked her in their first imperfect speech . The dawn broke ; the sharp grey winter ’s day came ; the storm had lulled ; but the whole earth was frost‐bound and white with snow , the air was piercing , the sky dark and overcast . She had to leave them ; she was bound to her daily labour at the mill ; she knew that if when the sun rose she were found to be absent , she and they too would surely suffer . What to do for them she could not tell . She had no friend save Marcellin , who himself was as poor as these . She never spoke to any living thing , except a sheep‐dog , or a calf bleating for its mother , or a toil‐worn bullock staggering over the ploughed clods . Between her , and all those around her , there were perpetual enmity and mistrust , and scarcely so much of a common bond as lies in a common humanity . For in her title to a common humanity with them they disbelieved ; while she in her scorn rejected all claim to it . At daybreak there passed by the open door in the mist , a peasant going to his cattle in the fields beyond , pushing through the snow a rude hand‐cart full of turnips , and other winter food . She rose and called to him . He stared and stood still . She went to the doorway and signed to him . “

54036	54093	54032	54032	Manon	152	” he echoed stupidly : he was her nearest neighbour , and he had helped her to fetch her washing‐water sometimes from the well half a league away , and when his wife had been down , with fever and ague , the old woman had nursed her carefully and well through many a tedious month . “
54146	54474	54139	54141	one of them	1437	” It was so dark still , that he had not seen at first who it was that addressed him , but slowly , as he stared and stared , and drew nearer to her , he recognised the scarlet girdle , the brown limbs , the straight brow , the fathomless eyes . He feared her , with a great fear rising there suddenly before him , out of that still white world of dawn and shadow . He dropped the handles of his cart and fled ; a turn in the road , and the darkness of the morning , soon hid him from sight . She thought that he had gone to summon his people , and she went back and sat again by the sleeping children , and watched the sad still faces of the dead . The peasant flew home as swiftly as his heavy shoes and the broken ice of the roads would allow . His cabin was at some distance , at a place where , amidst the fields , a few huts , a stone crucifix , some barns and stacks , and a single wineshop made up a little village , celebrated in the district for its wide spreading orchards and their excellence of fruits . Even so early the little hamlet was awake ; the shutters were opened ; the people were astir ; men were brushing the snow from their thresholds ; women were going out to their field‐work ; behind the narrow lattices the sleepy eyes and curly heads of children peered , while their fingers played with the fanciful encrustations of the frost . The keeper of the tavern was unbarring his house door ; a girl broke the ice in a pool for her ducks to get at the water ; a few famished robins flew to and fro songless . His own wife was on her doorstep ; to her he darted . “
54480	54484	54475	54476	Manon Dax	148	” he shouted . “
54489	54527	54534	54536	the old man	335	” said his wife , shouldering her broom ; a great many had died that winter , and they were so poor and sharp‐set with famine themselves , that they had neither bread nor pity to spare . “
54550	54598	54546	54546	his	335	“ The young devil of Yprès has killed her , that I am sure . She is there in the hut in the dark , with her eyes glaring like coals . And for what should she be there if not for evil ? Tell me that . ”
54599	54604	54605	54606	his wife	501	“ Is it possible ? ”
55097	55168	55169	55169	Flandrin	153	“ Flandrin , you have said well , beyond a doubt ; the good soul has been struck dead by sorcery . But , you have forgot one thing , the children are there , and that devil of Yprès is with them . We — good Christians and true — should not let such things be . Go , and drive her out and bring the young ones hither . ”
55198	55206	55208	55210	the other woman	1473	“ That is as it should be , ”
55212	55248	55208	55210	the other woman	1473	“ Go , Flandrin , and we — we will take the little souls in for this day , and then give them to the public charity , better can not be done . Go . ”
55249	55263	55265	55266	his wife	501	“ But mind that thou dost strike that beast , Folle‐Farine , sharply ! ”
55268	55284	55286	55286	another	1475	“ If thou showest her the cross , she will have to grovel and flee , ”
55288	55292	55286	55286	another	1475	“ Not she , ”
55304	55391	55294	55296	an old dame	1476	“ One day my blessed son , who is nearly a saint , Heaven knows , menaced her with his cross , and she stood straight , and fearless , and looked at it , and said , ‘ By that sign you do all manner of vileness in this world , and say you are safe to be blest in another ; I know ! ’ and so laughed and went on . What are you to do with a witch like that — eh ? ”
55392	55397	55399	55402	the women in chorus	1478	“ Go , Flandrin , ”
55404	55419	55399	55402	the women in chorus	1478	“ Go ! Every minute you waste the little angels are nearer to hell ! ”
55420	55428	55430	55430	Flandrin	153	“ Come yourselves with me , then , ”
55434	55451	55430	55430	Flandrin	153	“ I will not go after those infants , it is not a man 's work . ”
55588	55596	55598	55599	his wife	501	“ Let us go ourselves , then ! ”
55617	55651	55611	55611	she	501	“ Men are ever cowards . It shall never be said of me , that I left those babes to the fiend while I gave my own children their porridge by the fire ! ”
56461	56464	56465	56465	she	1524	“ What ! ”
56468	56503	56465	56465	she	1524	“ nine good Christians fearful of one daughter of hell ? Fie ! for shame ! Look ; my leaden Peter is round my neck ! Is he not stronger than she any day ? ”
56628	56644	56645	56645	one	1305	“ You met that poor saint and killed her in the snow with your witcheries ! ”
56648	56659	56661	56661	another	1475	“ You have stifled that poor babe where it lay ! ”
56663	56670	56672	56673	a third	1529	“ A good woman like that ! ”
56675	56703	56672	56673	a third	1529	“ who was well and blithe and praising God only a day ago , for I saw her myself come down the hill for our well water ! ”
56704	56727	56729	56730	a fourth	1530	“ It is as you did with the dear little Rémy , who will be lame all his life , through you , ”
56732	56747	56758	56759	a fifth	1531	“ You are not fit to live ; you spit venom like a toad . ”
56748	56756	56758	56759	a fifth	1531	“ Are you alive , my angels ? ”
56773	56795	56758	56759	a fifth	1531	“ Are you alive after that witch has gazed on you ? It is a miracle ! The Saints be praised ! ”
56844	56851	56852	56852	she	104	“ She was cold and hungry , ”
56876	56922	56852	56852	she	104	“ She had fallen , and was dying . I brought her here . The young child was killed by the snow . I stayed with the rest because they were frightened and alone . There is no more to tell . What of it ? ”
56923	56935	56942	56942	He	153	“ Thou hast better come away . What canst thou prove ? ”
57128	57133	57134	57134	she	633	” Ah — h ! ”
57137	57150	57134	57134	she	633	“ see how the innocent child is bewitched ! It is horrible ! ”
57151	57158	57166	57166	her	1541	“ Look on that;—oh infernal thing ! ”
57172	57196	57166	57166	her	1541	“ You dare not face that blessed image . See — see all of you — how she winces , and turns white ! ”
57577	57608	57610	57610	Flandrin	153	“ Prick her in the breast , and see if the devil be still in her . I have heard say there is no better way to test a witch ! ”
57697	57704	57706	57707	Rose Flandrin	153	“ What matter ; what matter ? ”
57709	57734	57735	57735	She	1541	“ When our fathers hunted witches in the old time , did they stop for that ? Draw blood , and you will see . ”
57752	57765	57766	57766	she	1541	“ It is the only babe that will ever cling to thee ! ”
57954	57971	57973	57974	the women	472	“ If one were to drive the nail to the head , she would not feel ! ”
58003	58059	57998	57998	Flandrin	153	“ There is our notary close at hand , on the road on his mule ! Hist ! Come out quickly . You know how strict he is , and how he forbids us ever to try and take the law into our own keeping . Quick — as you love your lives — quick ! ”
58160	58165	58166	58169	the old white‐haired notary	1568	" Is anything amiss ? "
58261	58282	58283	58283	they	472	“ Flandrin , going to his cow , saw her first , and he came to us and told us , ”
58304	58354	58283	58283	they	472	“ and we have taken the poor little things to carry them home ; we are going to give them food , and warm them awhile by the stove , and then we shall come back and do all that is needful for the beloved dead who are within . ”
58355	58368	58370	58403	the notary , who liked them all , having married them all , and registered their children ’s births , and who was a good old man though stern ; kindly and very honest	1572	“ That is well . That is good and neighbourly of you , ”
58474	58520	58521	58521	he	1572	“ How tender the poor are to the poor ! Those people have not bread enough for themselves , and yet they burden their homes with three strange mouths . Their hearts must be true at the core , if their tongues sometimes be foul , ”
58552	58566	58567	58567	they	472	“ To think we should have had to leave that fiend of Yprès ! ”
58573	58611	58567	58567	they	472	“ Well , there is one thing , she will not get over the hurt for days . Her bones will be stiff for many a week . That will teach her to leave honest folk alone . ”
58624	58633	58635	58635	Flandrin	153	“ Hold thy noise , thou little pig ! ”
58645	58675	58640	58640	Bernardou	150	“ Hold thy noise , I tell you , or I will put you in the black box in a hole in the ground , along with thy great‐grandmother . ”

59029	59037	59039	59040	Rose Flandrin	153	“ For the law is over good , ”
59042	59083	59039	59040	Rose Flandrin	153	“ and takes the part of all sorts of vile creatures . It will protect a rogue , a brigand , a bullock , a dog , a witch , a devil — anything,—except now and then an honest woman . ”
59291	59298	59299	59299	she	104	“ I tried to help you , ”
59302	59321	59299	59299	she	104	“ I was a fool . I might have known how they pay any good done to them . ”
59414	59428	59429	59429	she	104	“ I will never come abroad without a knife in my girdle again , ”
59495	59505	59507	59507	Folle‐Farine	104	“ She lied , even in her last breath ! ”
59509	59518	59507	59507	Folle‐Farine	104	“ She said that her God was good ! ”
60261	60279	60251	60251	she	147	“ Flamma ! there is thy gad‐about , who has not been a ’ bed all night . ”
60298	60303	60304	60304	he	335	“ Where hast been ? ”
60310	60328	60304	60304	he	335	“ Pitchou says thou hast not lain in thy bed all night long . Is it so ? ”
60347	60354	60355	60355	she	104	“ Yes , it is true , ”
60360	60367	60368	60368	he	335	“ And where hast been then ? ”
60418	60514	60408	60408	she	104	“ I went after old Manon Dax , to give her my supper . She died in the road , and I carried her home . And the youngest child was dead too . I stayed there because the children were alone ; I called to Flandrin and told him ; he came with his wife and other women , and they said I had killed old Dax ; they set on me , and beat me , and pricked me for a witch . It is no matter . But it made me late . ”
60745	60757	60758	60758	he	1651	“ Flandrin and his wife are honest people , and pious , ”
60766	60871	60758	60758	he	1651	“ When they find a wench out of her bed at night , they deal rightly with her , and do not hearken to any lies that she may tell them of feigned alms‐giving to cover her vices from their sight . I thank them that they did so much of my work for me . They might well prick thee for a witch ; but they will never cut so deep into thy breast , as to be able to dig the mark of the devil out of it . Now , up and work , or it will be worse for thee . ”
60997	61014	61016	61018	the man Flandrin	1449	“ My women dealt somewhat roughly with thy wench at break of day , good Flamma , ”
61047	61078	61016	61018	the man Flandrin	1449	“ I hope thou wilt not take it amiss ? The girl maddened my dame — spitting on her Peter , and throwing the blessed image away in a ditch . ”
61079	61085	61087	61087	Flamma	117	“ The woman did well , ”
63090	63094	63095	63095	she	501	“ One spark , ”
63105	63123	63095	63095	she	501	her—“one spark on the dry thatch , and what a bonfire they would have for their feasting ! ”
63212	63224	63227	63227	she	501	“ Another time , take care how you awake a witch ! ”
63404	63447	63389	63389	He	150	“ I know you — you were good that night . The people all say you are wicked , but you gave us your food , and held my hand . Take me back to gran’mère — oh , take me back ! ”
63494	63501	63502	63502	she	501	“ She is dead , Bernardou , ”
63536	63543	63545	63546	the boy	4995	“ Dead ! What is that ? ”
63548	63615	63545	63546	the boy	4995	“ She was stiff and cold , I know , and they put her in a hole ; but she would waken , I know she would , if she only heard us . We never cried in the night but she heard in her sleep , and got up and came to us . Oh , do tell her — do , do tell her ! ”
63646	63657	63658	63658	she	501	“ Why are you out in the cold , Bernardou ? ”
63690	63706	63707	63707	he	4995	“ They beat me ; they say I am naughty , because I want gran’mère , ”
63714	63757	63707	63707	he	4995	“ they beat me often , and oh ! if she knew , she would wake and come . Do tell her — do ! Bernardou will be so good , and never vex her , if only she will come back ! ”
63938	63948	63949	63949	Folle‐Farine	104	“ I wish I could take you , Bernardou ! ”
63970	63976	63949	63949	Folle‐Farine	104	“ I wish I could . ”
64175	64202	64203	64204	The speaker	789	“ Bernardou ! Bernardou ! thou little plague . Come within . What dost do out there in the dark ? Mischief , I will warrant . ”
64240	64245	64246	64246	she	104	“ Thou little beast ! ”
64252	64304	64305	64305	She	104	“ Dost dare talk to the witch that killed they grandmother ? Thou shalt hie to bed , and sup on a fine whipping . Thank God , thou goest to the hospital tomorrow ! Thou woudst bring a dire curse on the house in reward for our alms to thee . ”
64448	64453	64461	64461	she	104	“ God is good . ”
64454	64460	64461	64461	she	104	“ What is their God ? ”
64464	64485	64461	64461	she	104	“ They care for him , and he seems to care nothing for them whether they be old or young . ”
65113	65125	65106	65106	She	104	“ Open , Marcellin — open quickly . It is only I. ”
65173	65178	65131	65131	She	104	“ Who is there ? ”
65179	65186	65187	65187	she	104	“ It is I , Marcellin , ”
65190	65210	65131	65131	She	104	“ It is not night . I am come to be an hour with you . Is anything amiss ? ”
65255	65267	65268	65268	she	5264	“ Is it the old man , Marcellin , you want ? ”
65271	65280	65268	65268	she	5264	“ Marcellin , yes — where is he ? ”
65281	65301	65306	65306	Folle‐Farine	104	“ He died four days ago . Get you gone ; I will have no tramps about my place . ”
65302	65305	65268	65268	she	5264	“ Died ! ”
65348	65354	65356	65358	the old woman	334	“ Yes , why not ? ”
65360	65434	65356	65358	the old woman	334	“ To be sure men said that God would never him die , because he killed St. Louis ; but myself I never thought that . I knew the devil would not wait more than a hundred years for him — you can never cheat the devil , and he always seems stronger than the saints — somehow . You are that thing of Yprès , are you not ? Get you gone ! ”
65435	65445	65446	65446	she	1820	“ Who are you ? Why are you here ? ”
65477	65497	65498	65500	the old peasant	638	“ I am an honest woman and a pious ; and it befouls me to dwell where he dwelt , ”
65506	65583	65498	65500	the old peasant	638	“ I stood out a whole day , but when one is poor and the place is offered quit of rent , what can one do?—and it is roomy and airy for the fowls , and the priest has flung holy water about and purified it , and I have a Horse‐shoe nailed up , and a St. John in the corner . But be off with you , and take your foot from my door . ”
65588	65597	65598	65598	she	104	“ When did he die ; and how ? ”
65604	65625	65627	65629	the old woman	334	“ He was found dead on the road , on his heap of stones , the fourth night from this , ”
65647	65830	65832	65832	she	1823	“ Perhaps he had been hungered , I do not know ; or more likely the devil would not wait any longer ; anyways , he was dead — the hammer in his hand . Max Liében , the man that travels with the wooden clocks , found him . He lay there all night . Nobody would touch him . They say they saw the mark of the devil ’s claws on him . At last they got a dung‐cart , and took him away before the sun rose . He died just under the great Calvary — it was like his blasphemy . They have put him in the common ditch . I think it shame to let the man that slew a saint be in the same grave with all the poor honest folk who feared God , and were Christians though they might be beggars and outcasts . Get you gone , you be as vile as he . If you want him go ask your father the foul fiend for him — they are surely together now . ”
65848	65860	65861	65861	she	1823	“ Not but what the devil can get through the chinks , ”
65901	65910	65911	65911	she	104	“ He died alone — he died alone , ”
67906	67912	67960	67961	a man	4875	“ J’avais quelque chose là ! ”
68436	68455	68456	68456	he	4875	“ They will light some bakehouse fire to pay those that may throw my body in a ditch , ”

73216	73224	73225	73225	she	104	“ They are the dead , surely , ”

74742	74757	74758	74758	she	2159	“ The gods slew him because he dared to be too like to themselves , ”
74761	74775	74758	74758	she	2159	“ else he could not be so beautiful,—he,—only a man , and dead ? ”
74987	74997	74998	74998	she	2159	“ If they would give him back his life ? ”
75104	75125	75126	75126	She	2159	“ One life alone can ransom another . Live immortal with us ; or for that dead man — perish . ”

75242	75262	75239	75239	she	2159	“ As for me,—I am nothing — nothing . Let me die as the Dust dies — what matter ? ”
75610	75624	75625	75625	he	4875	“ To die — of hunger — like a rat in a trap ! ”
75760	75767	75768	75768	She	2159	“ To die — of hunger ! ”
76114	76117	76118	76118	he	4875	“ Bread,—bread,—bread ! ”
76121	76128	76118	76118	he	4875	“ To die for bread ! — ”
77013	77020	77010	77010	her	2159	“ I am stronger than they , ”
77451	77471	77472	77472	he	2250	“ That the mind of a man can be killed for the want of the food thrown to swine ! ”
78917	78926	78927	78927	she	2159	“ How like their god is to them ! ”
79232	79241	79242	79242	she	2159	“ They have left it all to me , ”

Why have you ever bade me desire the light and seek it , if for ever you must thrust me into the darkness of negation ? Shall I be Nothing?—like the muscle that rots , like the bones that crumble , like the flesh that turns to ashes , and blows in a film on the winds ? Shall I die so ? I?—the mind of a man , the breath of a god ? ”

82835	82842	82795	82796	the devil	4853	“ You had left it loose ? ”
82843	82866	82795	82796	the devil	4853	“ I got out to push it off the sand . It had grounded . I forgot it . It went adrift . ”
82867	82876	82795	82796	the devil	4853	“ What foul thing were you at meanwhile ? ”
82881	82899	82877	82877	She	2336	“ If you do not say , I will cut your heart out with a hundred stripes ! ”
82900	82904	82795	82796	the devil	4853	“ You can . ”
82905	82941	82795	82796	the devil	4853	“ I can ! you shall know truly that I can ! Go , get the boat — find it above or below water — or to the town prison you go as a thief . ”
83352	83359	83360	83360	she	2336	“ I have found the boat , ”
83428	83438	83439	83439	he	115	“ It is well for you that you have , ”
83445	83454	83439	83439	he	115	“ I will spare you half the stripes:—strip . ”
83505	83513	83514	83514	she	2336	“ I am guilty — this time , ”
84304	84338	84339	84339	He	2446	“ There lived once in the east , a great king ; he dwelt far away , amongst the fragrant fields of roses , and in the light of suns that never set . “
84453	84632	84445	84446	this king	2490	“ His buckler was sown with gems , but his heart beneath it was sore . For he had been long bitterly harassed by foes who descended on him as wolves from the hills in their hunger , and he ha been long plauged with heavy wars and with bad rice harvests , and with many troubles to his nation that kept it very poor , and forbade him to finish the building of new marble palaces , and the making of fresh gardens of delight , on which his heart was set . So he , being weary of a barren land and of an empty treasury , with all his might prayed to the gods that all he touched might turn to gold , even as he had heard had happened to some magician long before in other ages . And the gods gave him the thing he craved ; and his treasury overflowed . No king had ever been so rich , as this king now became in the short space of a single summer‐day . “
84641	84812	84439	84440	the people	4948	“ When he stretched out his hand to gather the rose that blossomed in his path , a golden flower scentless and stiff was all he grasped . When he called to him the carrier‐dove that sped with a scroll of love words across the mountains , the bird sank on his breast a carven piece of metal . When he was athirst and shouted to his cup bearer for drink , the red wine ran a stream of molten gold . When he would fain have eaten , the pulse and pomegranate grew alike to gold between his teeth . And lo ! at eventide , when he sought the silent chambers of his harem , saying , ‘ here at least shall I find rest , ’ and bent his steps to the couch whereon his best beloved slave was sleeping , a statue of gold was all he drew into his eager arms , and cold shut lips of sculptured gold were all that met his own . “
84844	84867	84874	84874	I	0	“ Now the world is too like that king , and in its greed of gold it will barter its life away . “
84903	84933	84874	84874	I	0	“ The future of the world is written . For God has granted their prayer to men . He has made them rich and their riches shall kill them . “
85226	85315	85320	85321	that king	6074	” His voice sank , and the silence that followed was only filled with the sound of the winds in the pine‐woods , and the sound of the sea on the shore . The people were very still and afraid ; for it seemed to them that he had spoken as prophets speak , and that his words were words of truth . Suddenly on the awe‐stricken silence an answering voice rang , clear , scornful , bold , and with the eager and fearless defiance of youth . “
85394	85493	85496	85496	thee	2520	” The speaker stood outside the crowd with a dead sea‐bird in his hand ; he was in his early boyhood , he had long locks of bright hair that curled loosely on his shoulders , and eyes of northern blue , that flashed like steel in their scorn . The people , indignant and terrified at the cold rough words which blasphemed their prophet , turned with one accord to draw off the rash doubter from that sacred audience place , but the Preacher stayed their hands with a gesture , and looked sadly at the boy . “
85510	85521	85505	85505	thou	2520	” The boy hung his head and his face flushed . “
85528	85532	85505	85505	thou	2520	” he muttered . “
85540	85584	85505	85505	thou	2520	” And he went on his way out from the people with his dead bird , which he had slain with a stone that he might study the exquisite mystery of its silvery hues . The Preacher followed him dreamily with his glance . “
85595	85599	85586	85586	he	2522	” he murmured . “
85622	85812	85586	85586	he	2522	” AND the words of the Preacher had come true ; so true that the boy Arslàn , grown to manhood , had dreamed of fame , followed the genius in him , and having failed to force the world to show faith in him , had dropped down dying on a cold hearth , for sheer lack of bread , under the eyes of the gods . It had long been day when he awoke . The wood smouldered , still warming the stone chamber . The owls that nested in the ceiling of the hall were beating their wings impatiently against the closed casements , blind with the light and unable to return to their haunts and homes . The food and the wine stood beside him on the floor ; the fire had scared the rats from theft . He raised himself slowly , and by sheer instinct ate and drank with the avidity of long fast . Then he stared around him blankly , blinded like the owls . It seemed to him that he had been dead ; and had risen from the grave . “
85827	86330	86333	86333	they	2523	” he muttered dully . His first sensation was disappointment , anger , weariness . He did not reason . He only felt . His mind was a blank . Little by little a disjointed remembrance came to him . He remembered that he had been famished in the coldness of the night , had endured much torment of the body , had fallen headlong and lost his consciousness . This was all he could recall . He looked stupidly for awhile at the burning logs ; at the pile of brambles ; at the flask of wine , and the simple stores of food . He looked at the grey closed window , through which a silvery daylight came . There was not a sound in the house ; there was only the cracking of the wood and the sharp sealike smell of the smoking pine boughs , to render the place different from what it had been when he last had seen it . He could recall nothing , except that he had starved for many days ; had suffered , and must have slept . Suddenly his face burned with a flush of shame . As sense returned to him , he knew that he must have swooned from weakness produced by cold and hunger ; that some one must have seen and succoured his necessity ; and that the food which he had half unconsciously devoured must have been the food of alms . His limbs writhed and his teeth clenched as the thought stole on him . To have gone through all the aching pangs of winter in silence , asking aid of none , only to come to this at last ! To have been ready to die in all the vigour of virility , in all the strength of genius , only to be saved by charity at the end ! To have endured , mute and patient , the travail of all the barren years , only at their close to be called back to life by aid that was degradation ! He bit his lips till the blood started , as he thought of it . Some eyes must have looked on him , in his wretchedness . Some face must have bent over him in misery . Some other human form must have been near his in this hour of his feebleness and need , or this thing could never have been . He would have died alone and unremembered of man , like a snake in its swamp or a fox in its earth . And such a death would have been to him tenfold preferable to a life restored to him by such means as these . Death before accomplishments is a failure , yet withal may be great ; but life saved by alms is a failure , and a failure for ever inglorious . So the shame of this ransom for death far outweighed with him the benefit . “
86339	86360	86333	86333	they	2523	” he cried in his soul against those unknown lives which had weighed his own with the fetters of obligation . “
86393	86897	86387	86387	they	2523	” And his heart was hard against them . They had stolen his only birthright — freedom . Had he craved life so much as to desire to live by shame he would sooner have gone out into the dusky night and have snatched food enough for his wants from some rich husbandman ’s granaries , or have stabbed some miser at prayers , for a bag of gold:—rather crime than the debt of a beggar . So he reasoned ; stung and made savage by the scourge of enforced humiliation . Hating himself because , in obedience to mere animal craving , he had taken and eaten , not asking whether what he took was his own . He had closed his mouth , living , and had been ready to die mute , glad only that none had pitied him ; his heart hardened itself utterly against this unknown hand which had snatched him from death ’s dreamless ease and ungrudged rest , to awaken him to a humiliation that would be as ashes in his teeth so long as his life should last . He arose slowly , and staggered to the casement . He fancied he was delirious , and had distempered visions of the food so long desired . He knew that he had been starving long — how long ? Long enough for his brain to be weak and visited with phantoms . Instinctively he touched the long round rolls of bread , the shape of the wine flask , the wicker of the basket : they were the palpable things of common life ; they seemed to tell him that he had not dreamed . Then it was charity ? His lips moved with a curse . That was his only thanksgiving . The windows were unshuttered ; through them he looked straight out upon the rising day — a day rainless and pale , and full of cool softness , after the deluge of the rains . The faint sunlight of a spring that was still chilled by winter was shed over the flooded fields and swollen streams ; snow‐white mists floated before the languid passage of the wind ; and the moist land gave back , as in a mirror , the leafless trees , the wooden bridges , the belfries and the steeples , and the strange sad bleeding Christs . On all sides near , the meadows were sheets of water , the woods seemed to drift upon a lake ; a swan ’s nest was washed past on broken rushes , the great silvery birds beating their heavy wings upon the air , and pursuing their ruined home with cries . Beyond , everything was veiled in the twilight of the damp grey vapour ; a world half seen , half shrouded , lovely exceedingly , filled with all divine possibilities and all hidden powers : a world such as Youth beholds with longing eyes in its visions of the future . “
86902	87501	87502	87502	I	0	” he said to himself ; and he smiled wearily as he said it . Beautiful , certainly ; in that delicious shadow ; in that vague light : in that cloud‐like mist , wherein the earth met heaven . Beautiful , certainly ; all those mystical shapes rising from the sea of moisture which hid the earth and all the things that toiled on it . It was beautiful , this calm , dim , morning world , in which there was no sound except the distant ringing of unseen bells ; this veil of vapour , whence sprang these fairy and fantastic shapes that cleft the watery air ; the land to the sky , in which all homely things took grace and mystery , and every common and familiar form became transfigured . It was beautiful ; but this landscape had been seen too long and closely by him for it to have power left to cheat his senses . Under that pure and mystical veil of the refracted rain things vile , and things full of anguish , had their being:—cattle in the slaughter‐houses ; the drunkards in the hovels ; disease and debauch and famine ; the ditch , that was the common grave of all the poor ; the hospital , where pincers and knives tore the living nerves in the inquisition of science ; the fields , where the women toiled bent , cramped , and hideous ; the dumb driven beasts , patient and tortured , for ever blameless , yet for ever accursed:—all these were there beneath that lovely veil , through which there came so dreamily the slender shafts of spires and the chimes of half heard bells . He stood and watched it long , so long that the clouds descended and the vapours shifted away , and the pale sun‐rays shone clearly over a disenchanted world , where roof joined roof and casement answered casement , and the figures on the crosses became but rude and ill‐carved daubs ; and the cocks crew to one another , and the herdsmen swore at their flocks , and the oxen flinched at the goad , and the women went forth to their field work ; and all the charm was gone . Then he turned away . The cold fresh breath of the morning had breathed upon him , and driven out the dull , delicious fancies that had possessed his brain . The simple truth was plain before him : that he had been seen by some stranger in his necessity and succoured . He was thankless ; like the sick , to whom unwelcome aid denies the refuge of the grave , calling him back to suffer , and binding on his shoulders the discarded burden of life ’s infinite weariness and woes . He was thankless ; for he had grown tired of this fruitless labour , this abortive combat ; he had grown tired of seeking credence and being derided for his pains , while other men prostituted their powers to base use and public gain , receiving as their wages honour and applause ; he had grown tired of toiling to give beauty and divinity to a world which knew them not when it beheld them . He had grown tired , though he was yet young , and had strength , and had passion , and had manhood . Tired — utterly , because he was destitute of all things save his genius , and in that none were found to believe . “
87516	87546	87549	87549	they	2525	” It does not need to have worn the imperial purples and to be lying dying in old age to know thus much in all truth and all bitterness . “
87556	88187	87549	87549	they	2525	” he said in his heart , as he turned aside from the risen sun . He had striven to do justly with this strange , fleeting , unasked gift of existence , which comes , already warped , into our hands , and is broken by death ere we can set it straight . He had not spent it in riot or madness , in lewd love or in gambling greed ; he had been governed by great desires , though these had been fruitless , and had spent his strength to a great end , though this had been never reached . As he turned from looking out upon the swollen stream that rushed beneath his windows , his eyes fell upon the opposite wall , where the white shapes of his cartoons were caught by the awakening sun . The spider had drawn his dusty trail across them ; the rat had squatted at their feet ; the darkness of night had enshrouded and defaced them ; yet with the morning they arose , stainless , noble , undefiled . Amongst them there was one colossal form , on which the sun poured with its full radiance . This was the form of a captive grinding at a mill‐stone ; the majestic symmetrical supple form of a man who was also a god . In his naked limbs there was a supreme power ; in his glance there was a divine command ; his head was lifted as though no yoke could ever lie on that proud neck ; his foot seemed to spurn the earth as though no mortal tie had ever bound him to the sod that human steps bestrode : yet at the corn‐mill he laboured , grinding wheat like the patient blinded oxen that toiled beside him . For it was the great Apollo in Pheræ . The hand which awoke the music of the spheres had been blood‐stained with murder ; the beauty which had the light and lustre of the sun had been darkened with passion and with crime ; the will which no other on earth or in heaven could withstand had been bent under the chastisement of Zeus . He whose glance had made the black and barren slopes of Delos to laugh with fruitfulness and gladness,—he whose prophetic sight beheld all things past , present , and to come , the fate of all unborn races , the doom of all unspent ages,—he , the Far‐Striking King , laboured here beneath the curse of crime , greatest of all the gods , and yet a slave . In all the hills and vales of Greece his Io pæan sounded still . Upon his holy mountains there still arose the smoke of fires of sacrifice . With dance and song the Delian maidens still hailed the divinity of Lêtô ’s son . The wave of the pure Ionian air still rang for ever with the name of Delphinios . At Pytho and at Clarus , in Lycia and in Phokis , his oracles still breathed forth upon their fiat terror or hope into the lives of men ; and still in all the virgin forests of the world the wild beasts honoured him wheresoever they wandered , and the lion and the boar came at his bidding from the deserts to bend their free necks and their wills of fire meekly to bear his yoke in Thessaly . Yet he laboured here at the corn‐mill of Admetus ; and watching him at his bondage there stood the slender , slight , wing‐footed Hermes , with a slow , mocking smile upon his knavish lips , and a jeering scorn in his keen eyes , even as though he cried : “
88301	89556	89557	89557	She	2532	” Thus to the artist by whom they had been begotten the dim white shapes of the deities spoke . Thus he saw them , thus he heard , whilst the pale and watery sunlight lit up the form of the toiler in Pheræ . For even as it was with the divinity of Delos , so is it likewise with the genius of a man , which , being born of a god , yet is bound as a slave to the grindstone . Since even as Hermes mocked the Lord of the Unerring Bow , so is genius mocked of the world , when it has bartered the herds and the grain , and the rod that metes wealth , for the seven chords that no ear , dully mortal , can hear . And as he looked upon this symbol of his life , the captivity and the calamity , the strength and the slavery of his existence overcame him ; and for the first hour since he had been born of a woman Arslàn buried his face in his hands and wept . He could bend great thoughts to take the shapes that he chose , as the chained god in Pheræ bound the strong kings of the desert and the forest to carry his yoke ; yet , like the god , he likewise stood fettered to the mill to grind for bread . A VALLEY long and narrow , shut out from the rest of the living world by the ramparts of stone that rose on either side to touch the clouds ; dense forests of pines , purple as night , where the erl‐king rode and the bear‐king reigned ; at one end mountains , mist , and gloom , at the other end the ocean ; brief days with the sun shed on a world of snow , in which the sounds of the winds and the moans of the wolves alone were heard in the solitude ; long nights of marvelous magnificence with the stars of the arctic zone glowing with an unbearable lustre above a sea of phosphorescent fire ; those were Arslàn ’s earliest memories — those had made him what he was . In that pine‐clothed Norwegian valley , opening to the sea , there were a few homesteads gathered together round a little wooden church , with great torrents falling above them , and a profound loneliness around ; severed by more than a day ’s journey from any other of the habitations of men . There a simple idyllic life rolled slowly on through the late and lovely spring times , when the waters loosened and the seed sprouted , and the white blossoms broke above the black ground : through the short and glorious summers , when the children ’s eyes saw the elves kiss the roses , and the fairies float on the sunbeam , and the maidens braided their fair hair with blue cornflowers to dance on the eve of St. John : through the long and silent winters , when an almost continual night brooded over all things , and the thunder of the ocean alone answered the war of the wind‐torn forests , and the blood‐red blaze of the northern light gleamed over a white still mountain world , and within doors , by the warm wood fire , the youths sang Scandinavian ballads , and the old people told strange Sagas , and the mothers , rocking their new‐born sons to sleep , prayed God for mercy to have on all human lives drowning at sea and frozen in the snow . In this Alpine valley , hidden amidst stupendous walls of stone , bottomless precipices , and summits that touched the clouds , there was a cottage even smaller and humbler than most , and closest of all to the church . It was the house of the pastor . The old man had been born there , and had lived there all the years of his life save a few that he had passed in a town as a student ; and he had wedded a neighbour who , like himself , had known no other home than this one village . He was gentle , patient , simple , and full of tenderness ; he worked like his people all the week through , in the open weather , amongst his fruit‐trees , his little breadth of pasturage , his herb‐garden , and his few sheep . On the seventh day he preached to the people the creed that he himself believed in with all the fond , unquestioning , implicit faith of the young children who lifted to him their round wandering eyes . He was good ; he was old : in his simple needs and his undoubting hopes he has happy ; all the living things of his little world loved him , and he loved them . And fate lit on him to torture him , as it is its pleasure to torture the innocent . It sent him a daughter who was fair to sight , and had a voice like music ; a form lithe and white , with hair of gold , and eyes like her own planets . She had never seen any other spot save her own valley ; but she had the old Berserker blood in her veins , and she was restless ; the sea tempted her with an intense power ; she desired passionately , without knowing what she desired . The simple pastoral work , the peaceful household labours , the girls ’ garland of alpine flowers , the youths ’ singing in the brief rose twilight , the saga told the thousandth time around the lamp in the deep mid‐winter silence ; these things would not suffice for her . The old Scandinavian madness was her veins . And one day the sea tempted her too utterly ; beyond her strength,—as a lover , after a thousand entreaties , one day tempts a woman , and one day finds her weak . The sea vanquished her , and she went — whither ? They hardly knew : to these old people the world that lay behind their mountain fortress was a blank . It might be a paradise ; it might be a prison . They could not tell . They suffered their sorrow meekly ; they never cursed her ; they did not even curse their fate because they had given life to a woman child . After awhile they heard of her . She wrote them tender and glowing words ; she was well , she was proud , she was glad , she had found those who told her that she had a voice which was as a gift of gold , and that she might sing in triumph to the nations . Such tidings came from time to time ; brief welcome words , first teeming with hope , then delirious with triumph , yet ever ending with a short sad sigh of conscience , a prayer for pardon — pardon for what ? The letters never said : perhaps only for the sin of desertion . The slow salt tears of age fell on these glowing pages in which the heart of a young , vain‐glorious , tender creature stamped itself ; but the old people never spoke of them to others . “
89568	90620	89557	89557	She	2532	” This was all they said , yet this gentle patience was a martyrdom too sharp to last ; when that year closed the mother was in her grave , and the old man left alone . The long silent winter came , locking the valley within its fortress of ice , severing it from all the rest of the breathing human world ; and the letters ceased . He would not let them say that she had forgotten ; he chose to think that the severance was due to the wall of snow which was built up between them rather than to any division of her ingratitude and oblivion . The sweet sudden Norwegian spring came , all the white and golden flowers breaking up from the hard crust of the soil , and all the loosened waters rushing with a shout of liberty to join the sea . The summer followed with the red mountain roses blossoming by the brooks , and the green mountain grasses blowing in the wind , with the music of the herd‐bells ringing down the passes , and the sound of the fife and of the reed‐pipe calling the maidens to the dance . In the midst of the summer , one night , when all the stars were shining above the valley , and all the children slept under the roofs with the swallows , and not a soul was stirring , save where here and there a lover watched a light glow in some lattice underneath the eaves , a half‐dead woman dragged herself feebly under the lime‐tree shadows of the pastor ’s house , and struck with a faint cry upon the door and fell at her father ’s feet , broken and senseless . Before the full day had dawned she had given birth to a male child ; and died as her son ’s eyes opened to the morning light . He inherited no name , and they called him after his grandsire , Arslàn . When his dead daughter lay stretched before him in the sunlight , with her white large limbs folded to rest , and her noble fair face calm as a mask of marble , the old pastor knew little — nothing — of what her life through these two brief years had been . Her lips had scarcely breathed a word since she had fallen senseless on his threshold . That she had triumph he knew ; that she had fallen into dire necessities he saw . Whether she had surrendered art for the sake of love , or whether she had lost the public favour by some caprice of the public , whether she had been eminent or obscure in her career , whether it had abandoned her or she had abandoned it , he could not tell , and he knew too little of the world to be able to learn . That she had travelled her weary way homeward to her native mountains that her son might not perish among strangers , he knew ; but no more . Nor was more ever known by any living soul . In life there are so many histories which are like broken boughs that strew the ground after a storm , snapped short at either end , so that none know the crown of them nor the root . The child whom she had left grew in goodliness and strength and stature , until the people said that he was like that child‐king , whom their hero Frithiof raised upon his buckler above the multitude ; and who was not afraid , but boldly gripped the brazen shield , and smiled fearlessly at the noonday sun . He had his mother ’s golden Scandinavian beauty ; the beauty of sculpture , white as the snow , of unusual height , and largely moulded ; and his free life amidst the ice‐fields and the pinewoods , and on the wild northern seas , developed both health and strength to their uttermost perfection . The people admired and wondered at him ; they did not love him . The lad was cold , dauntless , silent ; he repelled their sympathies and disdained their pastimes . He chose rather to be by himself than with them . He was never cruel ; but he was never tender ; and when he did speak he spoke with a sort of eloquent scorn and caustic imagery that seemed to them extraordinary in one so young . But his grandfather loved him greatly ; and reared him tenderly and wisely ; and braced him with a scholar ’s lore and with a mountaineer ’s exposure , so that both brain and body had their due . He was a simple childlike broken old man ; but in this vigorous youth that unfolded itself beside him his age seemed to strike fresh root , and he had wisdom and skill enough to guide its development justly . The desire of his soul was that his grandson should succeed him in the spiritual charge of that tranquil valley , and thus escaped the dire perils of the cities in which the mother ’s life had been caught and consumed like a moth ’s in flame . But Arslàn ’s eyes looked ever across the ocean with that look in them which had been in his mother ’s , and when the old man spoke of this holy and peaceful future , he was silent . Moreover , he — who had never beheld but the rude paintings on panels of pine that decorated the little red church under the firs and lindens,—he had the gift of art in him . He had few and rough means only with which to make his crude and unguided essays ; but the delirium of it was on him , and the peasants of his village gazed awe‐stricken and adoring before the things which he drew on every piece of pine‐wood , on every smooth breadth of sea‐worn granite , on every bare surface of lime‐washed wall that he could find at liberty for his usage . Whey they asked him what , in his manhood , he would do , he said little . “
90629	92342	92344	92344	I	0	” he made answer ; and he kept his word . Up to his twentieth year he never quitted the valley . He studied deeply , after his own manner , but nearly all his days were passed in the open air alone ; in the pure cold air of the highest mountain summits , amidst the thunder of the furious torrents ; in the black recesses of lonely forests , where none , save the wolf and the bear , wandered with him ; or away on the vast expanse of the sea , where the storm drove the great arctic waves like scourged sheep , and the huge breakers seized the shore as a panther its prey . On such a world as this , and in the marvelous nights of the north , his mind fed itself and gained its full powers . The feeble life of the old man held him to this lonely valley that seemed filled with the coldness , the mystery , the unutterable terror and majesty of the arctic pole , to which it looked ; but , unknown to him , it thus fettered him likewise where alone the genius in him could take its full shape and full stature . Unknown to him , in these years it took the depth , the strength , the patience , the melancholy , the virility of the North ; took these never to be lost again . In the twentieth winter of his life an avalanche engulfed the pastor ’s house , and the little church by which it stood ; covering both beneath a mountain of earth and snow and rock and riven trees . Some of the timbers withstood the shock , and the roof remained standing uncrushed above their heads . The avalanche fell some little time after midnight : there were only present in the dwelling himself , the old man , and a serving woman . The woman was killed on her bed by the fall of a beam upon her ; he and the pastor still lived : lived in perpetual darkness without food or fuel , or any ray of light . The wooden clock stood erect , uninjured ; they could hear the hours go by in slow succession . The old man was peaceful and even cheerful ; praising God often ; and praying that help might come to this beloved one . But his strength could not hold out against the icy cold , the long hunger , the dreadful blank around . He died ere the first day had wholly gone by , at even‐song ; saying still that he was content , and still praising God who had rewarded his innocence with shame , and recompensed his service with agony . For two more days and nights , Arslàn remained in his living tomb , enshrouded in eternal gloom , alone with the body of his grandfather , stretching out his hands ever and again to meet the icy touch rather than be without companionship . On the morning of the third day the people of the village , who had laboured ceaselessly , reached him ; and he was saved . As soon as the spring broke , he left the valley and passed over the mountains , seeking a new world . His old familiar home had become hateful to him ; he had no tie to it save two low graves , still snow‐covered underneath a knot of tall stone‐pines ; the Norse passion of wandering was in his veins as it had been in his mother ’s before him ; he mutely desired freedom , colour , knowledge , art , fame , as she had desired them , and he went : turning his face from that lowly green nest lying like a lark ’s between the hills . He did not go as youth mostly goes , blind with a divine dream of triumph : he went , consciously , to a bitter combat as the sea kings of old , whose blood ran in his veins , and whose strength was in his limbs , had gone to war , setting their prow hard against the sharp salt waves and in the teeth of an adverse wind . He was not without money . The pastor , indeed , had died almost penniless ; he had been always poor , and had given the little he possessed to those still poorer . But the richest landowner in the village , the largest possessor of flocks and herds , dying childless , had bequeathed his farm and cattle to Arslàn ; having loved the lad ’s dead mother silently and vainly . The value of these realised by sale gave to Arslàn , when he became his own master , what , in that valley at least , was wealth ; and he went without care for the future on this score into the world of men ; his mind full of dreams and the beautiful myths of dead ages ; his temper compounded of poetry and coldness , of enthusiasm and of scepticism ; his one passion a supreme ambition , pure as snow in its instinct , but half savage in its intensity . From that spring , when he had passed away from his birthplace as the winter snows were melting on the mountain sides , and the mountain flowers were putting forth their earliest buds under the pine boughs , until the time that he now stood solitary , starving , and hopeless before the mocking eyes of his Hermes , twelve years had run their course , and all through them he had never once again beheld his native land . Like the Scandinavian Regner , he chose rather to perish in the folds , and by the fangs , of the snakes that devoured him than return to his country with the confession of defeat . And despite the powers that were in him , his life had been a failure , an utter failure — as yet . In his early youth he had voyaged often , with men who went to the extreme north in search of skins and such poor trade as they could drive with Esquimaux or Koraks ; he had borne their dangers and their poverty , their miseries and their famine , for sake of seeing what they saw;—the pathless oceans of the ice realm , the trailing pines alone in a white snow world , the red moon fantastic and horrible in a sky of steel , the horned clouds of reindeer rushing through the endless night , the arch of the aurora spanning the heavens with their fire . He had passed many seasons of his boyhood in the silence , the solitude , the eternal desolation , and the mute mystery of that Arctic world , which for no man has either sympathy or story ; and in a way he had loved it , and was often weary for it ; in a way its spirit remained with him always ; and its inexorable coldness , its pitiless indifference to men ’s wants and weakness , its loneliness and its purity , and its scorn , were in all the works of his hand ; blended in a strange union with the cruelty , and the voluptuousness , and the gorgeousness of colour , which gave to everything he touched the glow and the temper of the east . Thus , what he did pleased none ; being for one half the world too chill , and being for the other half too sensual . The world had never believed in him ; and he found himself in the height and maturity of his powers condemned to an absolute obscurity . Not one man in a million knew his name . During these years he had devoted himself to the study of art with an undeviating subservience to all its tyrannies . He had studied humanity in all its phases ; he had studied form with all the rigid care that it requires ; he had studied colour in almost every land that lies beneath the sun ; he had studied the passions in all their deformities , as well as in all their beauties ; he had spared neither himself nor others in pursuit of knowledge . He had tried most vices , he had seen all miseries , he had spared himself no spectacle , however loathsome ; he had turned back from no license , however undesired , that could give him insight into empire over human raptures and affliction . Neither did he spare himself any labour however costly , however exhausting , to enrich his brain with that varied learning , that multifarious science which he held needful to every artist who dared to desire greatness . The hireling beauty of the wanton , the splendour of the sun and sea , the charnel lore of anatomy , the secrets of dead tongues and buried nations , the horrors of the lazar wards and pest‐houses , the glories of golden deserts and purple vineyards , the flush of love on a young girl ’s cheek , the rottenness of corruption on a dead man ’s limbs , the hellish riot of a brothel , the divine calm of an eastern night ; all things alike he studied , without abhorrence as without delight , indifferent to all save for one end,—knowledge and art . So entirely and undividedly did this possess him that it seemed to have left him without other passions ; even as the surgeon dissects the fair lifeless body of sone beautiful dead women , regardless of loveliness or sex , intent on the secret of disease , the mystery of formation , which he seeks therein , so did he study the physical beauty of women and their mortal corruption , without other memories than those of art . He would see the veil fall from off the limbs of a creature lovely as a goddess , and would think only to himself—“How
92358	92517	92518	92519	My God	2535	” One night , in the hot , close streets of Damascus , a man was stabbed,—a young Maronite — who lay dying in the roadway , without sign or sound , whilst his assassins fled ; the silver Syrian moon shining full on his white and scarlet robe , his calm , upturned face , his lean hand knotted on the dagger he had been spared no time to use ; a famished street dog smelling at his blood . Arslàn , passing through the city , saw and paused beside him ; stood still and motionless , looking down on the outstretched figure ; then drew his tablets out and sketched the serene , rigid face , the flowing , blood‐soaked robes , the hungry animal mouthing at the wound . Another painter , his familiar friend , following on his steps , joined him a little later , and started from his side in horror — “
92527	92531	92523	92523	you	2535	” he cried . “
92540	92543	92535	92536	see?—that man	2536	” Arslàn looked up—“I
92550	93198	92535	92536	see?—that man	2536	” he answered . It was thus always with him . He was not cruel . To animals he was humane , to women gentle , to men serene ; but his art was before all things with him , and with humanity he had little sympathy ; and if had passions , they had wakened no more than as the drowsy tigress wakes in the hot hush of noon , half indifferent , half lustful , to strike fiercely what comes before her , and then , having slain , couches herself and sleeps again . But for this absolute surrender of his life , his art had as yet recompensed him nothing . Men did not believe in him ; what he wrought saddened and terrified them ; they turned aside to those who fed them on simpler and on sweeter food . His works were great , but they were such as the public mind deems impious . They unveiled human corruption too nakedly , and they shadowed forth visions too exalted , and satires too unsparing , for them to be acceptable to the multitude . They were compounded of an idealism clear and cold as crystal , and of a reality cruel and voluptuous as love . They were penetrated with an acrid satire and an intense despair : the world caring only for a honied falsehood and a gilded gloss in every art , would have none of them . So far these twelve long years his labour had been waste , his efforts fruitless . Those years had been costly to him in purse;—travel , study , gold flung to fallen women , sums spent on faithless friends , utter indifference to whosoever robbed him , so long as he was left in peace to pursue lofty aims and high endeavours — all these did their common work on wealth which was scanty in the press of the world , though it had appeared inexhaustible on the shores of the north sea . His labours also were costly , and they brought him no return . The indifference to fortune in a man of genius looks , to a man of the world , the stupor of idiotcy : from such a stupor he was shaken one day to find himself face to face with beggary . His works were seen by few , and these few were antagonstic to them . All ways to fame were closed to him , either by the envy of other painters , or by the apathies and the antipathies of the nations themselves . In all lands he was repulsed ; he roused the jealousy of his compeers and the terror of the multitudes . They hurled against him the old worn‐out cry that the office of art was to give pleasure , not pain ; and when his money was gone , so that he could no longer , at his own cost , expose his works to the public gaze , they and he were alike obliterated from the public marts ; they had always denied him fame , and they at last thrust him quickly into oblivion , and abandoned him to it without remorse , and even with contentment . He could , indeed , with the facile power of eye and touch that he possessed , have easily purchased a temporary ease and evanescent repute , if he had given the world from his pencil those themes for which it cared , and descended to the common spheres of common art . But he refused utterly to do this . The best and greatest thing in him was his honesty to the genius wherewith he was gifted ; he refused to prostitute it ; he refused to do other than to tell the truth as he saw it . “
93208	93557	93203	93204	this man	1234	” his enemies had always hooted against him . It is what the world always says of those who utter unwelcome truths in its unwilling ears . So the words of the old Skald by his own northern seashores came to pass ; and at length , for the sake of art , it came to this , that he perished for want of bread . For seven days he had been without food , except the winter berries which he broke off the trees without , and such handfuls of wheat as fell through the disjointed timbers of the ceiling , for whose possession he disputed with the rats . The sheer absolute poverty , which leaves the man whom it has seized without so much as even a crust wherewith to break his fast , is commoner than the world in general ever dreams . For he was now so poor that for many months he had been unable to buy fresh canvas on which to work , and had been driven to chalk the outlines of the innumerable fancies that pursued him upon the bare smooth grey stone walls of the old granary in which he dwelt . He let his life go silently away without complaint , and without effort , because effort had been so long unavailing , that he had discarded it in a contemptuous despair . He accepted his fate , seeing nothing strange in it , and nothing pitiable ; since many better men than he had borne the like . He could not have altered it without beggary or theft , and he thought either of these worse than itself . There were hecatombs of grain , bursting their sacks , in the lofts above ; but when , once on each eighth day , the maltster owning them sent his men to fetch some from the store , Arslàn let the boat be moored against the wall , be filled with barley , and be pushed away again down the current , wihtout saying once to the rowers , “
93563	94369	92535	92536	see?—that man	2536	” And yet , though like a miser , amidst his gold , his body starved amidst the noble shapes and the great thoughts that his brain conceived and his hand called into substance , he never once dreamed of abandoning for any other the career to which he had dedicated himself from the earliest days that his boyish eyes had watched the fires of the Arctic lights glow above the winter seas . Art was to him as mother , brethren , mistress , offspring , religion — all that other men hold dear . He had none of these , he desired none of them ; and his genius sufficed to him in their stead . It was an intense and reckless egotism , made alike cruel and sublime by its intensity and purity , like the egotism of a mother in her child . To it , as the mother to her child , he would have sacrificed every living creature ; but to it also , like her , he would have sacrificed his very existence as unhesitatingly . But it was an egotism which , though merciless in its tyranny , was as pure as snow in its impersonality ; it was untainted by any grain of avarice , of vanity , of selfish desire ; it was independent of all sympathy ; it was simply and intensely the passion for immortality:—that sublime selfishness , that superb madness , of all great minds . Art had taken him for its own , as Demeter , in the days of her desolation , took the child Demophoon to nurture him as her own on the food of gods , and to plunge him through the flames of a fire that would give him immortal life . As the pusillanimous and sordid fears of the mortal mother lost to the child for evermore the possession of Olympian joys and of perpetual youth , so did the craven and earthly cares of bodily needs hold the artist back from the radiance of the life of the soul , and drag him from the purifying fires . Yet he had not been utterly discouraged ; he strove against the Metanira of circumstance ; he did his best to struggle free from the mortal bonds that bound him ; and , as the child Demophoon mourned for the great goddess that had nurtured him , refusing to be comforted , so did he turn form the base consolations of the sense and the appetites , and beheld ever before his sight the ineffable majesty of that Mater Dolorosa who once and for ever had anointed him as her own . Even now as the strength returned to his limbs and the warmth to his veins , the old passion , the old worship , returned to him . The momentary weakness which had assailed him passed away . He shook himself with a bitter impatient scorn for the feebleness into which he had been betrayed ; and glanced around him still with a dull wonder as to the strange chances which the past night had brought . He was incredulous still ; he thought that his fancy , heated by long fasting , might have cheated him ; that he must have dreamed ; and that the food and fuel which he saw must surely have been his own . Yet reflection told him that this could not be ; he remembered that for several weeks his last coin had been spent ; that he had been glad to gather the birds ’ winter berries to crush beneath his teeth , and gather the dropped corn from the floor to quiet the calm of hunger ; that for many a day there had been no fire on the hearth , and that only a frame which long sunless northern winters had braced to such hardihood in early youth , had enabled him to resist and endure the cold . Therefore , it must be charity . Charity!—as the hateful truth came home to him , he met the eyes of the white , slender , winged Hermes : eyes that from out that colourless and smiling face seemed to mock him with a cruel contempt . His was the old , old story — the rod of wealth bartered for the empty shell that gave forth music . Hermes seemed to know it and to jeer him . Hermes , the mischief‐monger , and the trickster of men ; the inventive god who spent his days in cajoling his brethren , and his nights in the mockery of mortals ; the messenger of heaven who gave Pandora to mankind ; Hermes , the eternal type of unscrupulous Success , seemed to have voice and cry to him:—“Oh
94402	95173	95174	95174	He	2540	” Arslàn turned from the great cartoon of the gods in Pheræ , and went out into the daylight , and stripped and plunged into the cold and turbulent stream . Its chilliness and the combat of its current braced his nerves and cleared his brain . When he was clad , he left the grain‐tower with the white forms of its gods upon its walls , and walk slowly down the banks of the river . Since life had been forced back upon him he knew that it was incumbent upon his manhood to support it by the toil of his hands if men would not accept the labour of his brain . Before , he had been too absorbed in his pursuit , too devoted to it , body and soul , to seek to sustain existence by sheer manual exertion which was the only thing that he had left untried for self‐maintenance . In a manner too he was too proud ; not too proud to labour , but too proud to easily endure to lay bare his needs to the knowledge of others . But now , human charity must have saved him ; a charity which he hated as the foulest insult of his life ; and he had no chance save to accept it like a beggar bereft of all shame , or to seek such work as would give him his daily bread . So he went ; feebly , for he was still weak from the length of his famine . The country was well known to him , but the people not at all . He had come by hazard on the old ruin where he dwelt , and had stayed there full a year . These serene blue skies , these pale mists , these corn‐clad slopes , these fields of pleasant of plenteous abundance , these quiet homesteads , these fruit‐harvests of this Norman plain were in a contrast intense , yet soothing , to all that his life had known . These old quaint cities , these little villages that seemed always hushed with the sound of bells , these quiet streams on which the calm sunlight slept so peacefully , these green and golden lands of plenty that stretched away to the dim grey distant sea,—all these had had a certain charm for him . He had abided with them , partly because amidst them it seemed possible to live on a handful of wheat and a draught of water , unnoticed and unpitied , partly because , having come hither on foot through many lands and by long hardships , he had paused there weary and incapable of farther effort . Whilst the little gold he had had on him had lasted he had painted innumerable transcripts of the ancient buildings , and of its summer and autumnal landscapes . And of late — through the bitter winter — of late it had seemed to him that it was as well to die here as elsewhere . When a man knows that his dead limbs will be huddled into the common ditch of the poor , the nameless , and the unclaimed , and that his dead brain will only serve for soil to feed some little rank wayside poisonous weed , it will seldom seem of much moment in what earth the ditch be dug , by what feet the sward be trod . He went on his way seeking work ; he did not care what , he asked for any that might serve to use such strength as hunger had left in him , and to give him his daily bread . But this is a great thing to demand in the world , and so he found it . They repulsed him everywhere . They had their own people in plenty , they had their sturdy , tough , weather‐beaten women , who laboured all day in rain , or snow , or storm , for a pittance , and they had these in larger numbers than their field‐work needed . They looked at him askance ; this man with the eyes of Arctic blue and the grave gestures of a king , who only asked to labour as the lowest amongst them . He was a stranger to them ; he did not speak their tongue with their accent ; he looked , with that white beauty and that lofty stature , as though he could crush them in the hollow of his hand . They would have none of him . “
95178	96541	95174	95174	He	2540	” they said amongst themselves ; and they would have none of him . He had an evil name with them . They said at eventide by their wood‐fires that strange things had been seen since he had come to the granary by the river . Once he had painted , from the pretty face of a stonecutter ’s little fair son , a study of the wondrous child Zagreus gazing in the fatal mirror ; the child was laughing , and happy , and healthful at noon , crowned with carnations and river lilies , and by sunset he was dead — dead like the flowers that were still amongst his curls . Once a girl had hired herself as a model to him for an Egyptian wanton , half a singer and half a gipsy — handsome , lithe , fantastic , voluptuous : the very night she left the granary she was drowned in crossing a wooden bridge of the river , which gave way under the heavy tramp of the fantoccini player who accompanied her . Once he had sketched , for the corner of an oriental study , a rare‐plumaged bird of the south , which was the idol of a water‐carrier of the district , and the wonder of all the children round : and from that date the bird had sickened and drooped , and lost its colours , and pined until it died . The boy ’s death had been from a sudden seizure of one of the many ills of infancy ; the dancing girl ’s had come from a common accident due to the rottenness of old worn water‐soaked timber ; the mocking‐bird ’s had arisen from the cruelty of captivity and the chills of northern winds ; all had been the result of simple accident and natural circumstance . But they had sufficed to fill with horror the minds of a peasantry always bigoted and strongly prejudiced against every stranger ; and it became to them a matter of implicit credence that whatsoever living thing should be painted by the artist Arslàn would assuredly never survive to see the rising of the morrow ’s sun . In consequence , for leagues around they shunned him ; not man , nor woman , nor child would sit to him as models ; and now , when he sought the wage of a daily labour amongst them , he was everywhere repulsed . He had long repulsed human sympathy , and in its turn it repulsed him . At last he turned and retraced his steps , baffled and wearied ; his early habits had made him familiar with all manner of agricultural toil ; he would have done the task of the sower , the herdsman , the hewer of wood , or the charcoal‐burner ; but they would none of them believe this of one with his glance and his aspect ; and solicitation was new to his lips and bitter there as gall . He took his way back along the line of the river ; the beauty of the dawn had gone , the day was only now chilly , heavy , with a rank moisture from the steaming soil . Broken boughs and uprooted bushes were floating on the turgid water , and over all the land there hung a sullen fog . The pressure of the air , the humidity , the colourless stillness that reigned throughout , weighed on lungs which for a score of years had only breathed the pure strong rarified air of the north ; he longed with a sudden passion to be once more amidst his native mountains under the clear steel‐like skies , and beside the rush of the vast wild seas . Were it only to die as he looked on them , it were better to die there than here . He longed , as men in deserts thirst for drink , for one breath of the strong salt air of the north , one sight of the bright keen sea‐born sun as it leapt at dawn from the waters . The crisp cold nights , the heavens which shone as steel , the forests filled with the cry of the wolves , the mountains which the ocean ceaselessly assailed , the mighty waves which marched erect like armies , the bitter Arctic wind which like a sabre cleft the darkness ; all these came back to him , beloved and beautiful in all their cruelty , desired by him , with a sick longing for their freshness , for their fierceness , for their freedom . As he dragged his tired limbs thought the grasses and looked out upon the sullen stream that flowed beside him , an oar struck the water , a flat black boat drifted beneath the bank , a wild swan disturbed rose with a hiss from the sedges . The boat was laden with grain ; there was only one rower in it , who steered by a string wound round her foot . She did not lift her face as she went by him ; but her bent brow and her bosom grew red , and she cut the water with a swifter , sharper stroke ; her features were turned from him by that movement of her head , but he saw the eastern outline of the cheek and chin , the embrowned velvet of the skin , the half‐bare beauty of the heaving chest and supple spine bent back in the action of the oars , the long slender and arched shape of the naked foot , round which the cord was twined;—their contour and their colour struck him with a sudden surprise . He had seen such oftentimes , eastwards , on the banks of golden rivers , treading , with such feet as these , the sands that were the dust of countless nations ; bearing , on such shoulders as these earthen water‐vases that might have served the feasts of Pharaohs ; showing such limbs as these against the curled palm branches and the deep blue sky upon the desert ’s edge . But here!—a face of Asia amongst the corn‐lands of Northern France ? It seemed to him strange ; he looked after her with wonder . The boat went on down the stream without any pause ; the sculls cleaving the heavy tide with regular and resolute monotony ; the golden piles of the grain and the brown form of the bending figure soon hidden in the clouds of river‐mist . He watched her , only seeing a beggar‐girl rowing a skiff full of corn down a sluggish stream . There was nothing to tell him that he was looking upon the saviour of his body from the thralls of death ; if there had been , in his mood , then , he would have cursed her . The boat glided into the fog which closed behind it ; a flock of water‐birds swam out from the rushes and darted at some floating kernels of wheat that had fallen over the vessel ’s side ; they fought and hissed , and flapped and pecked amongst themselves over the chance plunder ; a large rat stole amidst them unnoticed by them in their exultation , and seized their leader and bore him struggling and beating the air with blood‐stained wings away to a hole in the bank ; a mongrel dog , prowling on the shore , hearing the wild duck ’s cries , splashed into the sedges , and swam out and gripped the rat by the neck in bold sharp fangs , and bore both rat and bird , bleeding and dying , to the land ; the owner of the mongrel , a peasant making ready the ground for colza in the low‐lying fields , snatched the duck from the dog to bear it home for his own eating , and kicked his poor beast in the ribs for having ventured to stray without leave and to do him service without permission . “
96552	96571	96574	96574	one	1305	” thought Arslàn , as he turned aside to enter the stone archway of his own desolate dwelling . “
96584	96786	96574	96574	one	1305	” At that moment the setting sun pierced the heavy veil of the vapour , and glowed through the fog . The boat , now distant , glided for a moment into the ruddy haze , and was visible ; the water around it , like a lake of flame , the white steam above it , like the smoke of a sacrifice fire . Then the sun sank , the mists gathered closely once more , all light faded , and the day was dead . He felt stifled and sick at heart as he returned along the reedy shore towards his dreary home . He wondered dully why his life would not end : since the world would have none of him , neither the work of his brain nor the work of his hands , it seemed that he had no place in it . He was half resolved to lie down in the water there , amongst the reeds , and let it flow over his face and breast , and kiss him softly and coldly into the sleep of death . He had desired this many times ; what held him back from its indulgence was not “
96795	97350	96574	96574	one	1305	” of which Plato speaks ; he had no such misgiving in him , and he believed death to be a simple rupture and end of all things , such as any man had right to seek and summon for himself ; it was rather that the passion of his art was too strong in him , that the power to create was too intense in him , so that he could not willingly consign the forces and the fantasies of his brain to that annihilation to which he would , without thought or pause , have flung his body . As he entered the haunted hall which served him as his painting‐room , he saw a fresh fire of logs upon the hearth , whose leaping flames lighted the place with cheerful colour , and he saw on the stone bench fresh food , sufficient to last several days , and a brass flagon filled with wine . A curious emotion took possession of him as he looked . It was less surprise at the fact , for his senses told him it was the work of some charity which chose to hide itself , than it was wonder as to who , in this strange land , where none would even let him earn his daily bread , knew enough or cared enough to supply his necessities thus . And with this there arose the same intolerant bitterness of the degradation of alms , the same ungrateful hatred of the succour that seemed to class him amongst beggars , which had moved him when he had awakened with the dawn . He felt neither tenderness nor gratitude , he was only conscious of humiliation . There were in him a certain coldness , strength , and indifference to sympathy , which , whilst they made his greatness as an artist , made his callousness as a man . It might have been sweet to others to find themselves remembered and pitied by another at an hour when their forces were spent , their fate friendless , and their hopes all dead . But it was not so to him , he only felt like the desert animal which , wounded , repulses every healing hand , and only seeks to die alone . There was only one vulnerable , one tender nerve in him , and this was the instinct of his genius . He had been nurtured in hardihood , and had drawn in endurance with every breath of his native air ; he would have borne physical ills without one visible pang , and would have been indifferent to all mortal suffering ; but for the powers in him , for the art he adored , he had a child ’s weakness , a woman ’s softness . He could not bear to die without leaving behind his life some work the world would cherish . Call it folly , call it madness , it is both : the ivory Zeus that was to give its sculptor immortality , lives but in tradition ; the bronze Athene , that was to guard the Piræus in eternal liberty , has long been levelled with the dust ; yet with every age the artist still gives life for fame , still cries , “
97362	97586	96574	96574	one	1305	” It was this in him now which stirred his heart with a new and gentler emotion ; emotion which , while half disgust , was also half gladness . The food was alms‐given , since he had not earned it , and yet — by means of this sheer bodily subsistence — it would be possible for him to keep alive those dreams , that strength , by which he still believed it in him to compel his fame from men . He stood before the Phœbus in Pheræ , thinking ; it stung him with a bitter torment ; it humiliated him with a hateful burden — this debt which came he knew not whence , and which he never might be able to repay . And yet his heart was strangely moved ; it seemed to him that the fate which thus wantonly , and with such curious persistence , placed life back into his hands , must needs be one that would bear no common fruit . He opposed himself no more to it . He bent his head and broke bread , and ate and drank of the red wine:—he did not thank God or man as he broke his fast ; he only looked in the mocking eyes of Hermes , and said in his heart : — “
97596	98539	98541	98541	I	0	” And Hermes smiled : Hermes the wise , who had bought and sold the generations of men so long ago , in the golden age , and who knew so well how they would barter away their greatness and their gladness , and their bodies and their souls , for one sweet strain of his hollow reed‐pipe , for one sweet glance of his soulless Pandora ’s eyes . Hermes — Hermes the liar , Hermes the wise,—knew how men ’s oaths were kept . AT the close of that day Claudis Flamma discovered that he had been robbed — robbed more than once : he swore and raved and tore his hair for loss of a little bread and meat and oil and a flagon of red wine . He did not suspect his grand‐daughter ; accusing her perpetually of sins of which she was innocent , he did not once associate her in thought with the one offence which she had committed . He thought that the window of his store‐house had been forced from the exterior ; he made no doubt that his spoiler was some vagabond from one of the river barges . By such tramps his hen‐house and his apple‐lofts had often previously been invaded . She heard his lamentations and imprecations in unbroken silence ; he did not question her ; and without a lie she was able to keep her secret . In her own sight she had done a foul thing — a thing that her own hunger had never induced her to do . She did not seek to reconcile herself to her action by any reflection that she had only taken what she had really earned a thousand times over by her service ; her mind was not sufficiently instructed , and was of too truthful a mould to be capable of the deft plea of a sophistry . She could dare the thing ; and do it , and hold her peace about it , though she should be scourged to speak ; but she could not tamper with it to excuse it to herself ; for this she had neither the cunning nor the cowardice . Why had she done it?—done for a stranger what no pressure of need had made her do for her own wants ? She did not ask herself ; she followed her instinct . He allured her with his calm and kingly beauty , which was like nothing else her eyes had ever seen ; and she was drawn by an irresistible attraction to this life which she had bought at the price of her own from the gods . Yet stronger even than this sudden human passion which had entered into her was her dread lest he whom she had ransomed from death should know of his debt to her . Under such a dread , she never opened her lips to anyone on this thing which she had done . Silence was natural to her ; she spoke so rarely , that many in the province believed her to be dumb ; no sympathy had ever been shown to her to woo her to disclose either the passions that burnt latent in her veins , or the tenderness that trembled stifled in her heart . Thrice again did she take food and fuel to the water‐tower undetected , both by the man whom she robbed , and the man whom she succoured . Thrice again did she find her way to the desolate chamber in its owner ’s absence and refill the empty platters and warm afresh the cold blank hearth . Thrice again did Claudis Flamma note the diminution of his stores , and burnish afresh his old rusty fowling‐piece , and watch half the night on his dark staircase , and prepare with his own hands a jar of poisoned honey and a bag of poisoned wheat , which he placed , with a cruel chuckle of grim glee , to tempt the eyes of his spoilers . But the spoiler , being of his own household , saw this trap set , and was aware of it . In a week or two the need for these acts which she hated ceased . She learned that the stranger for whom she thus risked her body and soul , had found a boatman ’s work upon the water which , although a toil rough and rude , and but poorly paid , still sufficed to give him bread . Through she was herself so pressed with hunger , many a time , that as she went through the meadows and hedgerows she was glad to crush in her teeth the tender shoots of the briars , and the acrid berry of the brambles , she never again , unbidden , touched so much as a mouldy crust thrown out to be eaten by the poultry . Flamma , counting his possessions greedily night and morning , blessed the saints for the renewed safety of his dwelling , and cast forth the poisoned wheat as a thank‐offering to the male birds who were for ever flying to and fro their nested mates in the leafless boughs above the earliest violets , and whose little throats were strangled even in their glad flood of nuptial song , and whose soft bright eyes grew dull in death ere even they had looked upon the springtide sun . For it was ever thus that Folle‐Farine saw men praise God . She took their death to her own door , sorrowing and full of remorse . “
98554	98637	98541	98541	I	0	” she thought , as she say the rosy throats of the robins and bullfinches turned upward in death on the turf . She blamed herself bitterly with an aching heart . The fatality which makes human crime recoil on the innocent creatures of the animal world oppressed her with its heavy and hideous injustice . Their God was good , they said : yet for her sin and her grandsire ’s greed the harmless song‐birds died by the score in torment . “
98649	99082	98541	98541	I	0	” she thought . In this mute young lonely soul of hers Nature had sown a strong passion for justice , a strong instinct towards what was righteous . As the germ of a plant born in darkness underground will , by sheer instinct , uncurl its colourless tendrils , and thrust them through crevices and dust , and the close structure of mortared stones , until they reach the light and grow green and strong in it , so did her nature strive , of its own accord , through the gloom enveloping it , towards those moral laws which in all ages and all lands remain the same , no matter what deity be worshipped , or what creed be called the truth . He nascent mind was darkened , oppressed , bewildered , perplexed , even like the plant which , forcing itself upward from its cellar , opens it leaves not in pure air and under a blue sky , but in the reek and smoke and fœtid odours of a city . Yet , like the plant , she vaguely felt that light was somewhere ; and as vaguely sought it . With most days she took her grandsire ’s boat to and fro the town , fetching or carrying ; there was no mode of transit so cheap to him as this , whose only cost was her fatigue . With each passage up and down the river , she passed by the dwelling of Arslàn . Sometimes she saw him ; once or twice , in the twilight , he spoke to her ; she only bent her head to hide her face from him , and rowed more quickly on her homeward way in silence . At other times , in his absence , and when she was safe from any detection , she entered the dismal solitudes where he laboured , and gazed in rapt and awed amazement at the shapes that were shadowed forth upon the walls . The service by which he gained his daily bread was on the waters , and took him often leagues away — simple hardy toil , amongst fishers and canal‐carriers and bargemen . But it left him some few days , and all his nights , free for art ; and never in all the years of his leisure had his fancy conceived and his hand created more exquisite dreams and more splendid phantasies than now in this bitter and cheerless time , when he laboured amidst the poorest for the bare bread of life . “
99093	99183	98541	98541	I	0	” and in truth the gloom of the cellar gives birth to an art more sublime than the light of the palace can ever beget . Suffering shortens the years of the artist , and kills him oftentimes ere his prime be reached ; but in suffering alone are all great works conceived . The senses , the passions , the luxuries , the lusts of the flesh , the delirium of the desires , the colours , the melodies , the fragrance , the indolences,—all that made the mere “
99187	101797	101798	101798	I	0	” delightful , all go to enrich and to deepen the human genius which steeps itself in them ; but it is in exile from these that alone it can rise to its greatest . The grass of the Holy River gathers perfume from the marvelous suns , and the moonless nights , and the gorgeous bloom of the east , from the aromatic breath of the leopard and the perfume of the fallen pomegranate , and the sacred oil that floats in the lamps , and the caress of the girl‐bathers ’ feet , and the myrrh‐dropping unguents that glide from the maidens ’ bare limbs in the moonlight,—the grass holds and feeds on them all . But not till the grass has been torn from the roots , and been crushed , and been bruised and destroyed , can the full odours exhale of all it has tasted and treasured . Even the imagination of man may be great , but it can never be at its greatest until one serpent , with merciless fangs , has bitten it through and through , and impregnated it with passion and with poison,—that one deathless serpent which is Memory . Arslàn had never been more ceaselessly pursued by innumerable phantasies , and never had given to these a more terrible force , a more perfect utterance , than now , when the despair which possessed him was absolute,—when it seemed to him that he had striven in his last strife with fate , and been thrown never to rise again,—when he kept his body alive by such soulless ceaseless labour as that of the oxen in the fields — when he saw every hour drift by , barren , sullen , painful,—when only some dull yet staunch instinct of virility held him back from taking his own life in the bleak horror of these fruitless days,—when it seemed to him that his oath before Hermes , to make men call him famous , was idle as a sigh of a desert wind through the hollow ears of a skull bleaching white on the sand . Yet he had never done greater things — never in the long years through which he had pursued and studied art . With the poor wage that he earned by labour he bought by degrees the tools and pigments lacking to him , and lived on the scantiest and simplest food , that he might have wherewith in order to render into shape and colour the imaginations of his brain . And it was on these that the passionate , wondering , half‐blinded eyes of Folle‐Farine looked with awe and adoration in those lonely hours when , in his absence , she stole into his chamber , and touching nothing , scarcely daring to breathe aloud , crouched on the bare pavement mute and motionless , and afraid with a fear that was the sweetest happiness her brief youth had ever known . Though her own kind had neglected and proscribed her , with one accord , there had been enough in the little world surrounding her to feed the imaginative senses latent in her,—enough of the old mediæval fancy , of the old ecclesiastical beauty , of the old monastic spirit , to give her a consciousness , through a dumb one , of the existence of art . Untaught though she was , and harnessed to the dreary mill‐wheel round of a hard physical toil , she yet had felt dimly the charm of the place in which she dwelt . Where the fretted pinnacles rose in hundreds against the sky,—where the common dwellings of the poor were panelled and parquetted and carved in a thousand fashions,—where the graceful and the grotesque and the terrible were mingled in an inextricable , and yet exquisite , confusion,—where the grey squat jug that went to the well , and the jolting beam to which the clothes ’ line was fastened , and the creaking sign that swung above the smallest wine‐shop , and the wooden gallery on which the poorest troll hung out her many‐coloured rags , had all some trace of a dead art , some fashioning by a dead hand,—where all these were , it was not possible for any creature dowered by nature with any poetic instinct to remain utterly unmoved and unawakened in their midst . Of the science and the execution of art she was still absolutely ignorant ; the powers by which it was created still seemed a magic incomprehensible , and not human ; but its meaning she felt with that intensity which is the truest homage of all homage to its influence . Day after day , therefore , she returned and gazed on the three gods of forgetfulness , and on all the innumerable forms and fables which bore them company ; the virgin field of her unfilled mind receiving the seeds of thought and of fancy that were scattered so largely in this solitude , lying waste , bearing no harvest . Of these visits Arslàn himself knew nothing ; towards him her bold wild temper was softened to the shyness of a doe . She dreaded lest he should ever learn what she had done ; and she stole in and out of the old granary , unseen by all , with the swiftness and the stealthiness which she shared in common with other untamed animals which , like her , shunned all man and woman kind . And this secret — in itself so innocent , yet for which she would at times blush in her loneliness , with a cruel heat that burnt over all her face and frame — changed her life , transfigured it from its objectless , passionless , brutish dulness and monotony , into dreams and into desires . For the first time she had in her joy and fear ; for the first time she became human . All the week through he wrought perforce by night ; the great windows stood wide open to the bright cold moons of early spring ; he worked only with black and white using colour only at sunrise , or on the rare days of his leisure . Often at nightfall she left her loft , as secretly as a fox its lair , and stole down the river , and screened herself amongst the grasses , and watched him where he laboured in the mingling light of the moon and of the oil‐lamp burning behind him . She saw these things grow from beneath his hand , these mighty shapes created by him ; and he seemed to her like a god , with the power to beget worlds at his will , and all human life in its full stature out from a little dust . The contrast of this strength , of this power which he wielded , with the helpless exhaustion of the body in which she had found him dying , smote her with a sorrow and a sweetness that were like nothing she had ever known . That a man could summon hosts at his command like this , yet perish for a crust!—that fusion of omnipotence and powerlessness , which is the saddest and strangest of all the sad strange things of genius , awoke an absorbing emotion in her dormant heart ! She watched him thus for hours in the long nights of a slow‐footed spring , in whose mists and chills and heavy dews her inured frame took no more harm than did the green corn shooting through the furrows . She was a witness to his solitude . She saw the fancies of his brain take form . She saw the sweep of his arm call up on the blank of the wall , or on the pale spaces of the canvas , these images which for her had alike such majesty and such mystery . She saw the faces beam , the eyes smile , the dancing‐women rise , the foliage uncurl , the gods come forth from the temples , the nereids glide through the moonlit waters , at his command , and beneath his touch . She saw him also in those moments when , conceiving no eyes to be upon him , this man , whom mankind denied , loosened rein to the bitterness in him ; and , standing weary and heartsick before these creations for which his generation had no sight , and no homage , let the agony of constant failure , of continual defeat , overcome him , and cursed aloud the madness which possessed him , which drove him on for ever in this ungrateful service , and would not let him do as other men did — tell the world lies , and take its payment out in gold . Until now she had hated all things , grieved for none , unless , indeed , it were for a galled ox toiling wounded and tortured on the field ; or a trapped bird , shrieking in the still midnight woods . But now , watching him , hearing him , a passionate sorrow for a human being possessed her . And to her eyes he was so beautiful in that utter unlikeness to herself and to all men whom she had seen . She gazed at him , never weary of that cold , fair , golden beauty , like the beauty of his sun‐god ; of those serene deep‐lidded eyes , which looked so often past her at the dark night skies ; of those lithe and massive limbs , like the limbs of the gladiator that yonder on the wall strained a lion to his breast in the deadly embrace of combat . She gazed at him until she loved him with the intense passion of a young and ignorant life , into whose gloom no love had ever entered . With this love the instinct of her womanhood arose , amid the ignorance and savagery of her nature ; and she crouched perpetually under the screen of the long grass to hide her vigil , and whenever his eyes looked from his easel outward to the night she drew back , breathless and trembling , she knew not why , into the deepest shadow . Meantime , with that rude justice which was in her , she set herself atonement for her fault — the fault through which those tender little bright‐throated birds were stretched dead amongst the first violets of the year . She laboured harder and longer than ever for her task‐master , and denied herself the larger half of even those scanty portions which were set aside for her of the daily fare , living on almost nothing , as those learn to do who are reared under the roof of the French poor . To his revilings she was silent , and under his blows patient . By night she toiled secretly , until she had restored the value of that which she had taken . Why did she do it ? She could not have told . She was proud of the evil origin they gave her ; she had a cynical gladness in her infamous repute ; she scorned women and hated men ; yet all the same she kept her hands pure of thefts and her lips pure of lies . So the weeks went on till the hardness of winter gave way to the breath of the spring , and in all the wood and orchard around the water‐mill of Yprès the boughs were green with buds , and the ground was pale with primroses — a spring all the sweeter and more fertile because of the severity of the past winter . It became mid‐April . It was market‐day for all the country lying round that wondrous cathedral‐spire , which shot into the air far‐reaching and ethereal , like some fountain whose column of water had been arrested aloft and changed to ice . The old quiet town was busy , with a rich sunshine shed upon it , in which the first yellow butterflies of the year had begun to dance . It was high noon , and the highest tide of the market . Flower‐girls , fruit‐girls , egg‐sellers , poultry‐hucksters , crowds of women , old and young , had jolted in on their docile asses , throned on their sheepskin saddles ; and now , chattering and chaffering , drove fast their trade . On the steps of the cathedral boys with birds’‐nests , knife‐grinders making their little wheels fly , cobblers hammering , with boards across their knees , travelling pedlars with knapsacks full of toys and mirrors , and holy images , and strings of beads , sat side by side in amicable competition . Here and there a priest passed , with his black robe and broad hat , like a dusky mushroom amongst a bed of many‐hued gillyflowers . Here and there a soldier , all colour and glitter , showed like a gaudy red tulip in bloom amidst tufts of thyme . The old wrinkled leathern awnings of the market stalls glowed like copper in the brightness of noon . The red tiles of the houses edging the great square were gilded with yellow houseleeks . The little children ran hither and thither with big bunches of primroses or sheaves of blue wood hyacinths , singing . The red and blue serges of the young girls ’ bodices were like the gay hues of the anemones in their baskets . The brown faces of the old dames under the white roofing of their headgear were like the russet faces of the home‐kept apples which they had garnered through all the winter . Everywhere in the shade of the flapping leather , and the darkness of the wooden porches , there were the tender blossoms of the field and forest , of the hedge and garden . The azure of the hyacinths , the pale saffron of the primroses , the cool hues of the meadow daffodils , the ruby eyes of the cultured jonquils , gleamed amongst wet rushes , grey herbs , and freshly budded leafage . Plovers ’ eggs nestled in moss‐lined baskets ; sheaves of velvet‐coated wallflowers poured fragrance on the air ; great plumes of lilac nodded on the wind , and amber feathers of laburnum waved above the homelier masses of mint and marjoram , and sage and chervil . It was high noon , but the women still found leisure time to hear the music of their own tongues , loud as the clacking of mill paddles . In one corner an eager little group was gathered round the stall of a favourite flower‐seller , who wore a bright crimson gown , and a string of large silver beads about her neck , and a wide linen cap , that shaded her pretty rosy face as a great snowy mushroom may grow between the sun and a little ruddy wild strawberry . She had brown eyes that were now brimming over with tears as she stood surrounded by all the treasures of spring . She held clasped in her arms a great pot with a young almond tree growing in it , and she was weeping as though her heart would break , because a tile had fallen from a roof above and crushed low all its pink splendour of blossom . “

101886	101912	101884	101884	Edmée	188	” groaned an old woman , tottering from her nut‐stall with a heap of ruffled , blood‐stained , brown plumage held up in her hand . “

102008	102034	102001	102001	she	2546	” said a tanner ’s wife , who drew after her , clinging to her skirts , a little lame , mis‐shapen , querulous child . “

102097	102118	102086	102086	her	2546	” asked a youth looking up from plucking the feathers out from a living , struggling , moaning , goose . “

102166	102179	102163	102163	we	2555	” they cried in a hearty chorus round the broken almond tree . “

102224	102233	102221	102222	little Bernardou	150	” added one who had not hitherto spoken . “

102316	102321	102323	102325	an old woman	5264	“ Nay , indeed , ”
102349	102444	102467	102467	he	5041	“ Nay , was it not only this very winter that my son ’s little youngest brother threw a stone at her , just for luck , as she went by in her boat through the town ; and it stuck her and drew blood from her shoulder ; and that self‐same night a piece of the oaken carvings in the ceiling gave way and dropped upon the little angel as he slept , and broke his arm above the elbow:—she is a witch ; there is no question but she is a witch . ”
102445	102461	102467	102467	he	5041	“ If I were sure so , I would think it well to kill her , ”

103138	103158	103171	103171	he	2592	“ Who is a witch — who dances naked ? — who bathes with devils at the full moon ? ”
103193	103209	103171	103171	he	2592	“ It is a shame to see the child of Reine Flamma so dealt with , ”
103234	103247	103248	103248	he	2594	“ A jettatrice should be killed for the good of the people , ”
103309	103328	103330	103333	the cripple ’s mother	2585	“ She is always mute like that ; she can not feel . Strike , strike , strike ! ”
103470	103481	103482	103482	they	2600	“ Stone her to death ! stone her to death ! ”
103549	103556	103557	103561	One of the elder lads	2606	“ Strike ! strike ! strike ! ”
103812	103816	103817	103817	she	2593	“ Strike now ! ”
105895	105898	105885	105885	his	167	said:—“Not yet . ”
107012	107393	107396	107396	you	2741	” And for those glowing colours of passion which burned so hotly for an instant , only so soon to fade out into the pallor of indifference or satiety , he had a contempt which almost took the place and the semblance of chastity . He worked on and on , studying the sleeper at his feet , with the passionless keenness of a science that was as merciless in its way as the science which tortures and slaughters in order to penetrate the mysteries of sentient existence . She was beautiful in her way , this dark strange foreign child , who looked as though her native home must have been where the Nile lily blooms , and the black brows of the Sphinx are bent against the sun . She was beautiful , like a young leopard , like a young python , coiled there , lightly breathing , and mute and motionless and unconscious . He painted her as he would have painted the leopard or python lying asleep in the heavy hush of a noon in the tropics . And she was no more to him than these would have been . The shadows grew longer ; the sunlight died off the bright head of the boy Hypnos ; the feathery reeds on the bank without got a red flush from the west ; there came a sudden burst of song from a boat‐load of children going home from the meadows where they had gathered the first cowslips of the season in great sheaves that sent their sweetness on the air though the open window as they went by beneath the walls . The shouts of the joyous singing rang shrilly through the silence ; they pierced her ear and startled her from her slumber ; she sprang up suddenly , with a bound like a hart that scents the hounds , and stood fronting him ; her eyes opened wide , her breath panting , her nerves strained to listen and striving to combat . In the first bewildered instant of her awakening she 0 thought that she was still in the market‐place of the town and that the shouts were from the clamour of her late tormenters . He turned and looked at her . “
107399	107451	107396	107396	you	2741	” he asked her , in the tongue of the country . She started afresh at the sound of his voice , and drew her disordered dress together , and stood mute , with her hands crossed on her bosom , and the blood coming and going under her transparent skin . “
107457	107462	107454	107454	you	2741	” he asked again . “
107466	107700	107463	107463	I	0	” She echoed his cowardly word with a half‐tremulous defiance ; the heroism of her nature , which an hour earlier had been lashed to its fullest strength , cast back the question as an insult ; but her voice was low and husky , and the blood dyed her face scarlet as she spoke . For she feared him ; and for the moment she had forgotten how she had come there and all that had passed , except that some instinct of the long‐hunted animal was astir in her to hide herself and fly . But he stood between her and the passage outward , and pride and shame held her motionless . Moreover , she still listened intently : the confused voices of the children still seemed to her like those of the multitude by whom she had been chased ; and she was ready to leap tiger‐like upon them , rather than let them degrade her in his sight . He looked at her with some touch of interest : she was to him only some stray beggar girl , who had trespassed into his solitude ; yet there was that in her untamed regard , in her wide open eyes , in the stag‐like grace of her attitude , in the sullen strength which spoke in her reply , that warmed him to closer notice of all these . “
107708	107715	107703	107703	you	2742	” he asked her , slowly . “
107730	107787	107790	107790	you	2742	” The colour burned in her face ; she said nothing . The singing of the children was waxing fainter , as the boat floated from beneath the wall on its homeward way into the town . She ceased to fancy these cries the cries of her foes , and recollection began to revive in her . “
107793	107856	107790	107790	you	2742	” he repeated , musing how he should persuade her to return to the attitude sketched out upon the easel . She returned his look with the bold truthfulness natural to her , joined with that apprehensiveness of chastisement which becomes second nature to every creature that is for ever censured , cursed , and beaten for every real or imagined fault . “
107863	108002	107857	107857	I	0	” she answered him , with a backward movement of her hand , which had a sort of reverence in it , up to the forms of the gods above her . The answer moved him ; he had not thought to find a feeling so high as this in this ragged , lonely , sunburnt child ; and , to the man for whom , throughout a youth of ambition and of disappointment , the world had never found the voice of favour , even so much appreciation as lay in this outcast ’s homage had its certain sweetness . For a man may be negligent of all sympathy for himself , yet never , if he be poet or artist , will he be able utterly to teach himself indifference to all sympathy for his works . “
108005	108012	108015	108015	they	2744	” he echoed , in surprise . “
108020	108200	108015	108015	they	2744	” She coloured at the unconcealed contempt that lay in his last word ; her head drooped ; she knew that they were much to her — friends , masters , teachers divine and full of pity . But she had no language in which to tell him this ; and if she could have told him , she would have been ashamed . Also , the remembrance of those benefits to him , of which he was ignorant , had now come to her through the bewilderment of her thoughts , and it locked her lips to silence . Her eyes dropped under his ; the strange love she bore him made her blind and giddy and afraid ; she moved restlessly , glaring round with the half‐timid , half‐fierce glances of a wild animal that desires to escape and can not . Watching her more closely , he noticed for the first time the stains of blood upon her shoulder , and the bruise on her chest , where the rent in her linen left it bare . “
108206	108211	108201	108201	You	2746	” he asked her , “
108215	108221	108242	108243	The people	4948	” She shook her head . “
108226	108227	108242	108243	The people	4948	” “
108240	108241	108242	108243	The people	4948	” “
108247	108248	108242	108243	The people	4948	” “
108255	108256	108242	108243	The people	4948	” “
108259	108260	108242	108243	The people	4948	” “
108264	108265	108266	108266	I	0	” “
108270	108371	108266	108266	I	0	” She answered him with the quiet calm of one who offers an all‐sufficient reply . But the reply to him told nothing : he had been too shunned by the populace , who dreaded the evil genius which they attributed to him , to have been told by them of their fancies and follies ; and he had never essayed to engage either their companionship or their confidence . To be left to work , or to die , in solitude undisturbed was the uttermost that he had ever asked of any strange people amidst whom he had dwelt . “
108377	108381	108373	108373	you	0	” he repeated . “
108390	108398	108266	108266	I	0	” She gave a gesture of assent . “
108406	108431	108400	108400	you	0	” She paused a moment , glancing still hither and thither all round , as a trapped bird glances , seeking his way outward . “
108436	108440	108400	108400	you	0	” she muttered ; “
108475	108582	108468	108468	I	0	” He looked at her more earnestly than he had done before . The repressed passion that glanced under her straight dusky brows , the unspoken scorn which curled on her mouth , the nervous meaning with which her hands clenched on the folds of linen on her breast , attracted him ; there was a force in them all which aroused his attention . There were in her that conscious power for ferocity , and that contemptuous abstinence from its exercise , which lie so often in the fathomless regard of the lion ; he moved nearer to her , and addressed her more gently . “
108587	108591	108468	108468	I	0	” he asked , “
108603	108604	108595	108596	these people	5831	” “
108609	108621	108605	108605	I	0	” she answered him again , unable to add anything else . “
108628	108629	108605	108605	I	0	” “
108632	108633	108605	108605	I	0	” “
108646	108647	108641	108641	You	0	” “
108654	108655	108641	108641	You	0	” “
108662	108663	108664	108664	He	2755	” “
108668	108669	108664	108664	He	2755	” “
108675	108680	108671	108671	you	0	” She was silent . “
108683	108684	108671	108671	you	0	” “
108687	108881	108882	108882	He	2756	” They were but words to her — empty and meaningless . She knew that he beat her more often because she told truth or refused to cheat . For aught that she was sure of , she might be wrong , and he right . Arslàn looked at her musingly . All the thought he had was to induce her to return to the attitude necessary to the completion of his picture . He put a few more questions to her ; but the replies told him little . At all times silent , before him a thousand emotions held her dumb . She was afraid , besides , that at every word he might suspect the debt he owed to her , and she dreaded its avowal with as passionate a fear as though , in lieu of the highest sacrifice and service , her action had been some crime against him . She felt ashamed of it , as of some unholy thing ; it seemed to her impious to have dared to give him back a life that he had wearied of , and might have wished to lose . “
108892	109198	108887	108887	he	2756	” she said to herself . She had never imagined what fear meant until she had looked on this man ’s face . Now she dreaded , with an apprehension which made her start like a criminal at every sound , lest he should ever know of this gift of life which , unbidden , she had restored to him : which , being thus given , her instinct told her he would only take as the burden of an intolerable debt , of an unmeasurable shame . Perfect love casts out fear , runs the tradition ; rather , surely , does the perfect love of a woman break the courage which no other thing could ever daunt , and set foot on the neck that no other yoke would ever touch . By slow degrees he got from her such fragments of her obscure story as she knew . That this child , so friendless , ill‐treated , and abandoned , had been the saviour of his own existence , he never dreamed . A creature beaten and half starved herself could not , for an instant , look to him one likely to have possessed even such humble gifts as food and fuel . Besides , his thoughts were less with her than with the interrupted study on his easel , and his one desire was to induce her to endure the same watch upon her , waking , which had had power to disturb her even in her unconsciousness . She was nothing to him , save a thing that he wished to turn to the purpose of his art — like a flower that he plucked on his way through the fields , for the sake of its colour , to fill in some vacant nook in a mountain foreground . “
109205	109257	109199	109199	You	2757	” he asked her , whilst she stood before him , flushing and growing pale , irresolute and embarrassed , with her hands nervously gathering the folds of her dress across her chest , and her sad , lustrous , troubled eyes glancing from side to side in a bewildered fear . “
109260	109264	109265	109265	You	2758	” she muttered . “
109278	109279	109273	109273	I	0	” “
109300	109305	109306	109306	They	2759	” Her face dropped . “
109316	109337	109339	109339	they	2759	” she murmured , with a pathetic , apologetic timidity in her voice . He laughed a little ; bitterly . “
109365	109366	109367	109367	I	0	” “
109369	109388	109389	109389	You	2758	” She glanced at him half‐wistfully , half‐despairingly ; she thought that he spoke in derision of her . “
109391	109395	109389	109389	You	2758	” he answered . “
109659	109664	109665	109665	he	2763	“ You are glad ? ”
109679	109684	109671	109671	She	2758	“ I am frightened ! ”
109740	109750	109751	109751	he	2763	“ Well then — let me paint you there , ”
109758	109775	109751	109751	he	2763	“ I am too poor to offer you a reward for it . I have nothing — ”
109776	109781	109782	109782	she	2758	“ I want nothing , ”
109809	109872	109804	109804	He	2763	“ I can not boast the same . But , since you care for all these hapless things that are imprisoned here , do me , their painter , this one grace . Lie there , in the shadow again , as you were when you slept , and let me go on with this study of you till the sun sets . ”
109896	109901	109902	109902	she	2758	“ If you care ! ”
110009	110036	110037	110037	She	2758	“ Certainly I care . Go yonder and lie as you were lying a few moments ago — there in the shadow , under these gods . ”
110883	110890	110891	110891	he	172	“ There is nothing else here , ”
110894	110914	110891	110891	he	172	“ But since you care for such things , take as may of them as you will as recompense . ”
111066	111072	111073	111073	she	2784	“ I want no payment , ”
111088	111107	111073	111073	she	2784	“ Wait . I did not mean to hurt you . Will you not take them as reward ? ”
111108	111111	111112	111112	She	2784	“ No . ”
111150	111161	111162	111162	he	602	“ Can you return to‐morrow ? or any other day ? ”
111208	111213	111214	111214	she	2784	“ If you wish , ”
111221	111235	111214	111214	she	2784	“ I do wish , surely . The sketch is all unfinished yet . ”
111236	111242	111243	111243	She	2784	“ I will come then . ”
111289	111297	111298	111298	She	2784	“ Shall I go with you homeward ? ”
111303	111315	111300	111300	her	2784	“ But the people who struck you!—they may attack you again ? ”
111326	111337	111323	111323	her	2784	“ I showed them a knife!—they are timid as hares . ”
111338	111345	111323	111323	her	2784	“ You are always by yourself ? ”
111346	111349	111350	111350	She	2784	“ Always . ”
111406	111412	111413	111413	he	2796	“ You will come back ? ”
111425	111428	111429	111429	she	2784	“ Yes , ”
111611	111625	111626	111626	he	2796	“ If she should not come , it will be of little moment , ”
111629	111638	111626	111626	he	2796	“ I have nearly enough for remembrance there . ”
112450	112456	112457	112459	The old man	335	mumbled—“like mother , like child . ”
112482	112488	112489	112489	he	335	“ A whole day wasted ! ”
112500	112511	112489	112489	he	335	“ Beast ! What hast thou to say for thyself ? ”
112534	112539	112540	112540	she	2784	“ I say nothing , ”
112543	112548	112549	112549	he	335	“ Nothing ! nothing ! ”
112554	112616	112549	112549	he	335	“ Then we will find a way to make thee speak . Nothing!—when three of the clock should have seen thee back hither at latest , and five hours since then have gone by without account . You have spent it in brawling and pleasure — in shame and iniquity — in vice and in violence , thou creature of sin ! ”
112617	112625	112626	112626	She	2784	“ Since you know , why ask ? ”
112680	112741	112674	112674	his	335	“ Five hours , five mortal hours , stolen from me , your lawful work left undone that you may riot in some secret abomination that you dare not to name . Say where you have been , what you have done , you spawn of hell , or I will wring your throat as I wring a sparrow ’s ! ”
112742	112750	112751	112751	She	2784	“ I have done as I chose . ”
112784	112925	112927	112927	he	2838	“ As you choose ! Oh‐ho ! You would speak as queens speak — you — a thing less than the worm and the emmet . As you choose — you!—who have not a rag on your back , not a crust of rye bread , not a leaf of salad to eat , not a lock of hay for your bed , that is not mine — mine — mine . As you choose . You!—you thing begotten in infamy ; you slave ; you beggar ; you sloth ! You are nothing — nothing less than the blind worm that crawls in the sand . You have the devil that bred you in you , no doubt ; but it shall go hard if I can not conquer him when I bruise your body and break your will . ”
113153	113158	113159	113159	she	2839	“ Touch me again ! ”
113174	113194	113164	113164	her	2839	“ Touch me again ; and by the heaven and hell you prate of , I will kill you ! ”
113989	113995	113996	113996	he	115	“ Get to thy den , ”
114003	114017	113996	113996	he	115	“ We are a‐bed too late . To‐morrow I will deal with thee . ”
114083	114086	114080	114080	Arslàn	172	“ beauty , ”
114546	114549	114550	114550	she	2839	“ Beautiful ! ”
114555	114583	114550	114550	she	2839	“ only as a poppy as a snake , as a night moth are beautiful — beautiful — and without fragrance , or sweetness , or worth ! ”
114979	114990	114991	114991	she	334	“ Prayer did little to keep holy the other one , ”
114994	115005	114991	114991	she	334	“ unless , indeed , the devil heard and answered . ”
115043	115050	115052	115054	the old woman	334	“ Thou hast a good labourer , ”
115088	115117	115118	115118	She	334	“ Take heed that thou dost not drive her away , Flamma . One may beat a saddled mule safely , but hardly so a wolf ’s cub . ”
115420	115432	115434	115436	the old man	335	“ She also is a saint ; let God take her ! ”
115605	115639	115594	115594	he	335	“ Thou lettest that which was pure escape me to be defiled and be slaughtered , and now Thou lettest that which is vile escape me to become beautiful and free and strong ! ”
115694	115715	115692	115692	himself	335	“ She was devil begotten . Would it not be well once and for all to rid men of her ? ”
115792	115805	115789	115789	she	334	“ He shall not do it till I have been back there . ”
116009	116019	116020	116020	she	334	“ I have worked from daybreak through to sunset , ”
116027	116041	116020	116020	she	334	“ It is enough for man and beast . The rest I claim . ”
116114	116121	116122	116122	he	335	“ There is hell in her , ”
116127	116141	116122	116122	he	335	“ Let her go to her rightful home . There is one thing — ”
116142	116148	116150	116152	the old woman	334	“ There is one thing ? ”
116179	116199	116168	116168	He	335	“ One thing . I have made the devil work for me hard and well ten whole years through ! ”
116200	116204	116206	116208	the woman Pitchou	613	“ The devil ! ”
116214	116260	116206	116208	the woman Pitchou	613	“ Dost thou think the devil was ever such a fool as to work for thy wage of blows and of black bread ? Why , he rules the world , they say ! And how should he rule unless he paid his people well ! ”
116804	116810	116811	116811	he	2923	“ Do not look there , ”
116816	116824	116811	116811	he	2923	“ I had forgotten you . Otherwise — ”
116825	116838	116785	116785	he	2923	“ I have looked there . It is only a dead woman . ”
116839	116848	116785	116785	he	2923	“ Only ! What makes you say that ? ”
116849	116863	116864	116864	He	2923	“ I do not know . There are many — are there not ? ”
116915	116921	116922	116922	he	2923	“ There are many indeed , ”
116928	117007	116922	116922	he	2923	“ Just there is the toughest problem — it is the insect life of the world ; it is the clouds of human ephemeræ , begotten one summer day to die the next ; it is the millions on millions of men and women born , as it were , only to be choked by the reek of cities , and then fade out to nothing ; it is the numbers that kill one ’s dream of immortality ! ”
117068	117078	117079	117079	she	104	“ It is Fortis , the rag‐picker ’s daughter , ”
117130	117133	117134	117134	he	2923	“ Yes , ”
117138	117160	117134	117134	he	2923	“ It is his daughter . She died twenty hours ago,—of low fever , they say — famine , no doubt . ”
117161	117169	117170	117170	She	104	“ Why do you have her here ? ”
117208	117216	117217	117217	he	2923	“ The dead sit to me often , ”
117233	117236	117217	117217	he	2923	“ Why ? ”
117237	117248	117217	117217	he	2923	“ That they may tell me the secrets of life . ”
117249	117255	117217	117217	he	2923	“ Do they tell them ? ”
117256	117791	117217	117217	he	2923	“ A few;—most they keep . See,—I paint death ; I must watch it to paint it . It is dreary work , you think ? It is not so to me . The surgeon seeks his kind of truth ; I seek mine . The man Fortis came to me on the river side last night . He said to me , ‘ You like studying the dead , they say ; have my dead for a copper coin . I am starving;—and it can not hurt her . ’ So I gave him the coin — though I am as poor as he — and I took the dead woman . Why do you look like that ? It is nothing to you ; the girl shall go to her grave when I have done with her . She bent her head in assent . It was nothing to her ; and yet it filled her with a cruel feverish jealousy , it weighed on her with a curious pain . She did not care for the body lying there — it had been but the other day that the dead girl had shot her lips out at her in mockery and called her names from a balcony in an old ruined house as the boat drifted past it;—but there passed over her a dreary shuddering remembrance that she , likewise , might one day lie thus before him and be no more to him than this . The people said that he who studied death , brought death . The old wistful longing that had moved her , when Marcellin had died , to lay her down in the cool water and let it take her to long sleep and to complete forgetfulness , returned to her again . Since the dead were of value to him , best , she thought , be of them , and lie here in that dumb still serenity , caressed by his touch and his regard . For , in a manner , she was jealous of this woman , as of some living rival who had , in her absence , filled her place and been of use to him and escaped his thought . Any ghastliness or inhumanity in this search of his for the truth of his art amidst the frozen limbs and rigid muscles of a corpse , never occurred to her . To her he was like a deity ; to her these poor weak shreds of broken human lives , these fragile empty vessels , whose wine of life had been spilled like water that runs to waste , seemed beyond measurement to be exalted when deemed by him of value . She would have thought no more of grudging them in his employ and in his service than priests of Isis or of Eleusis would have begrudged the sacrificed lives of the beasts and birds that smoked upon their temple altars . To die at his will and be of use to him;—this seemed to her the most supreme glory fate could hold ; and she envied the rag‐picker ’s daughter lying there in such calm content . “
117801	117807	117794	117794	you	2932	” he said at length . “
117824	117825	117826	117826	I	0	” “
117833	117847	117848	117848	I	0	” she answered slowly , with a certain perplexed pain upon her face . “
117897	118046	117889	117889	I	0	” He started at the strangeness and suddenness of the words spoken steadily and with perfect sincerity and simplicity in the dialect of the district , with no sense in their speaker of anything unusual being offered in them . His eyes tried to search the expression of her face with greater interest and curiosity than they had ever done ; and they gained from their study but little . For the innumerable emotions awakening in her were only dimly shadowed there , and had in them the confusion of all imperfect expressions . He could not tell whether here there was a great soul struggling through the bonds of an intense ignorance and stupefaction , or whether there were only before him an animal perfect , in its physical development , but mindless as any clod of earth . He did not know how to answer her . “
118054	118060	118049	118049	you	0	” he said at last . “
118069	118075	118049	118049	you	0	” She stared at him . “
118091	118092	118049	118049	you	0	” “
118106	118112	118113	118114	A woman	4876	” She laughed a little . “
118120	118121	118116	118116	Marcellin	135	” “
118132	118158	118161	118162	a woman	4876	” She pointed to the corpse which the last sun‐rays were brightening , till the limbs were as alabaster and the hair was as gold . “
118217	118236	118214	118214	they	2944	” His mouth smiled with a touch of sardonic humour , whose acrimony and whose irony escaped her . “
118256	118264	118265	118265	You	0	” Her eyes clouded and lightened alternately . “
118275	118276	118265	118265	You	0	” “
118296	118297	118299	118300	a woman	4876	” “
118302	118311	118313	118314	a woman	4876	” she muttered with disappointment and with impatience . “
118316	118327	118313	118314	a woman	4876	” he echoed as he pointed to the god Hermes . “
118334	118335	118336	118336	He	2951	” “
118338	118349	118336	118336	He	2951	” She looked rapidly and wistfully at the white‐winged god . “
118423	119794	118417	118417	your	4876	” She obeyed him and told him what she knew ; lying there , where he had motioned her , in the shadow under the figures of the three grandsons of Chaos . He listened , and wrought on at her likeness . The story , as she told it in her curt imperfect words , was plain enough to him , though to herself obscure . It had in some little measure a likeness to his own . It awakened a certain compassion for her in his heart , which was rarely moved to anything like pity . For to him nature was so much and man so little , the one so majestic and so exhaustless , the other so small and so ephemeral , that human wants and human woes touched him but very slightly . His own , even at their darkest , moved him rather to self‐contempt than to self‐compassion , for these were evils of the body and of the senses . As a boy he had had no ear to the wail of the frozen and famishing people wandering homeless over the waste of drifted snow , where but the night before a village had nestled in the mountain hollow ; all his senses had been given in a trance of awe and rapture to the voices of the great winds sweeping down from the heights through the pine‐forests , and of the furious seas below , gnashing and raging on the wreck‐strewn sand . It was with these last that he had had kinship and communion , these endured always ; but for the men they slew , what were they more in the great sum of time than forest‐leaves or ocean driftwood ? And , indeed , to those who are alive to the nameless , universal , eternal soul which breathes in all the grasses of the fields , and beams in the eyes of all creatures of earth and air , and throbs in the living light of palpitating stars , and thrills through the young sap of forest trees , and stirs in the strange loves of wind‐borne plants , and hums in every song of the bee , and burns in every quiver of the flame , and peoples with sentient myriads every drop of dew that gathers on a hare‐bell , every bead of water that ripples in a brook — to these the mortal life of man can seem but little , save at once the fiercest and the feeblest thing that does exist ; at once the most cruel and the most impotent ; tyrant of direst destruction and bondsman of lowest captivity . Hence , pity entered very little into his thoughts at any time ; the perpetual tortures of life did indeed perplex him , as it perplexes every thinking creature , with wonder at the universal bitterness that taints all creation , at the universal death whereby all forms of life are nurtured , at the universal anguish of all existence which daily and nightly assails the unknown God in piteous protest at the inexorable laws of inexplicable miseries and mysteries . But because such suffering was thus universal , therefore he almost ceased to feel pity for it ; of the two he pitied the beasts far more than the human kind:—the horse staggering beneath the lash in all the feebleness of hunger , lameness , and old age ; the ox bleeding from the goad on the hard furrows , or stumbling through the hooting crowd , blind , footsore , and shivering , to its last home in the slaughter‐house ; the dog , yielding up its noble life inch by inch under the tortures of the knife , loyally licking the hand of the vivisector while he drove his probe through its quivering nerves ; the unutterable hell in which all these gentle , kindly and long‐suffering creatures dwelt for the pleasure or the vanity , the avarice or the brutality of men,—these he pitied perpetually , with a tenderness for them that was the softest thing in all his nature . But when he saw men and women suffer he often smiled , not ill pleased . It seemed to him that the worst they could ever endure was only such simple retribution , such mere fair measure of all the agonies they cast broadcast . Therefore he pitied her now for what repulsed all others from her — that she had so little apparent humanity , and that she was so like an animal in her strength and weakness , and in her ignorance of both her rights and wrongs . Therefore he pitied her ; and there was that in her strange kind of beauty , in her half‐savage , half‐timid attitudes , in her curt , unlearned , yet picturesque speech , which attracted him . Besides , although solitude was his preference , he had been for more than two years utterly alone , his loneliness broken only by the companionship of boors , with whom he had not had one thought in common . The extreme poverty in which the latter months of his life had been passed , had excluded him from all human society , since he could have sought none without betraying his necessities . The alms‐seeking visit of some man even more famished and desperate than himself , such as the rag‐picker who had brought the dead girl to him for a few brass coins , had been the only relief to the endless monotony of his existence , a relief that made such change in it worse than its continuance . In Folle‐Farine for the first time in two long , bitter , colourless , hated years , there was something which aroused his interest and his curiosity , some one to whom impulse led him to speak the thoughts of his mind with little concealment . She seemed , indeed , scarcely more than a wild beast , half‐tamed , inarticulate , defiant , shy , it might be even , if aroused , ferocious ; but it was an animal whose eyes dilated in quickening sympathy with all his moods , and an animal whom , at a glance , he knew would , in time , crawl to him or combat for him as he chose . He talked to her now , much on the same impulse that moves a man , long imprisoned , to converse with the spider that creeps on the floor , with the mouse that drinks from his pitcher , and makes him treat like an intelligent being the tiny flower growing blue and bright between the stones , which is all that brings life into his loneliness . The prison door once flung open , the sunshine once streaming across the darkness , the fetters once struck off , the captive once free to go out again amongst his fellows , then — the spider is left to miss the human love that it has learnt , the mouse is left to die of thirst , the little blue flower is left to fade out as it may in the stillness and the gloom alone . Then they are nothing : but while the prison doors are still locked they are much . Here the gaoler was poverty , and the prison was the world ’s neglect , and they who lay bound were high hopes , great aspirations , impossible dreams , immeasurable ambitions , all swathed and fettered , and straining to be free with dumb , mad force against bonds that would not break . And in these , in their bondage , there were little patience , or sympathy , or softness , and to them , even nature itself at times looked horrible , though never so horrible , because never so despicable as humanity . Yet , still even in these an instinct of companionship abided ; and this creature , with a woman ’s beauty , and an animal ’s fierceness and innocence , was in a manner welcome . “
119802	119860	119797	119797	women	365	” she said , after awhile , following , though imperfectly , the drift of his last words , where she lay stretched , obedient to his will , under the shadow of the wall . He smiled the smile of one who recalls some story he has heard from the raving lips of some friend fever‐stricken . “
119975	120110	119968	119968	he	4870	“ Years went with him thus , and he grew old , and he said to himself , ‘ I have lived content ; so shall I die purified , and ready for the kingdom of heaven . ’ For it was in the day when that wooden god , who hangs on the black cross yonder , was not a lifeless effigy as now , but a name of power and of might , adjuring , while his people smiled under torture , and died in the flame , dreaming of a land where the sun never set , and the song never ceased , and the faithful for ever were at rest . So the years , I say , went by with him , and he was glad and at peace . “
120156	120248	120148	120148	him	4870	“ He was loth , and dreaded to accede to her prayer , for he said , ‘ Wheresoever a woman enters , there the content of man is dead . ’ But she was in dire distress , and entreated him with tears and supplications not to turn her adrift for the lightning and the lions to devour : and he felt the old human pity steal on him , and he opened the door to her , and bade her enter and take sanctuary there in God ’s name . “
120310	120413	120419	120419	she	2967	“ And she laughed in his beard , and cried , saying ‘ Thou thinkest thou hast lived , and yet thou hast not loved ? Oh sage ! oh saint ! oh fool , fool , fool ! ’ then into his veins there rushed youth , and into his brain there came madness ; the life he had led seemed but death , and eternity loathsome since passionless ; and he stretched his arms to her and sought to embrace her , crying , ‘ Stay with me , though I buy thee with hell . ’ And she stayed . “
120497	120530	120531	120531	Arslàn	172	“ He searched for her in every city , and in every land . Some say he searches still , doomed to live on through every age , and powerless to die . ”
120775	120780	120781	120781	she	2976	“ That is true ! ”
120789	120808	120781	120781	she	2976	“ It is a saint ’s story in substance ; it is true in spirit for all time . ”
120834	120851	120852	120852	Arslàn	172	“ If I be a woman , shall I then be such a woman as that ? ”
120869	120892	120854	120854	his	172	“ Why not ? You are the devil ’s daughter , you say . Of such are men ’s kingdom of heaven ! ”
120935	120946	120947	120947	she	2976	“ Do , then , men love what destroys them ? ”
120952	120955	120956	120956	he	172	“ Always ! ”
120994	121001	121002	121002	she	2976	“ I do not want love , ”
121025	121054	121002	121002	she	2976	“ I want , I want , to have power as the priest has on the people when he says , ‘ pray ! ’ and they pray . ”
121055	121058	121059	121059	he	172	“ Power ! ”
121072	121102	121059	121059	he	172	“ Who does not ? But do you think the woman that tempted the saint had none ? If ever you reach that kingdom such power will become yours . ”
121211	121227	121228	121228	she	2976	“ I have prayed to the devil again and again and he will not hear , ”
121231	121248	121228	121228	she	2976	“ Marcellin says that he has ears for all . But for me he has none . ”
121249	121309	121176	121176	He	172	“ He has too much to do to hear all . All the nations of the earth beseech him . Yonder man on the cross they adjure with their mouths indeed ; but it is your god only whom in their hearts they worship . See how the Christ hangs his head : he is so weary of lip‐service . ”
121310	121330	121228	121228	she	2976	“ But since they give the Christ so many temples , why do they raise none to the devil ? ”
121331	121424	121176	121176	He	172	“ Chut ! No man builds altars to his secret god . Look you : I will tell you another story . Once , in an Eastern land , there was a temple dedicated to all the deities of all the peoples that worshipped under the sun . There were many statues and rare ones ; statues of silver and gold , of ivory , and agate , and chalcedony , and there were altars raised before all , on which every nation offered up sacrifice and burned incense before its divinity . “
121466	121530	121547	121547	he	5005	“ The noise was fearful , and the feuds were many , and the poor king , whose thought it had been to erect such a temple , was confounded , and very sorrowful , and murmured , saying—‘I dreamed to beget universal peace and tolerance and harmony ; and lo ! there come of my thoughts nothing but discord and war . ’ “
121592	121660	121662	121663	each man	6927	“ The king gave him permission ; and he raised up a simple stone , and on it he wrote , ‘ To the Secret Sin ! ’ and , being a sorcerer , he wrote with such a curious power , that showed the inscription to the sight of each man , but blinded him whilst he gazed on it to all sight of his fellows . “
121711	121841	121701	121709	not one man left to worship one of them	2998	” She listened ; her eloquent eyes fixed on him , her lips parted , her fancy fantastic and full of dreams , strengthened by loneliness , and unbridled through ignorance , steeping itself in every irony and every phantasy , and every shred of knowledge that Chance , her only teacher , cast to her . She sat thinking , full of a vague sad pity for that denied and forsaken God on the cross , by the river , such as she had never felt before ; since she had always regarded him as the symbol of cruelty , of famine and of hatred ; not knowing that these are only the colours which all deities alike reflect from the hearts of the peoples that worship them . “
121848	121854	121701	121709	not one man left to worship one of them	2998	” she said , suddenly . “
121872	121876	121863	121863	I	0	” Arslàn smiled . “
121900	121901	121886	121886	they	5171	” “
121907	121908	121909	121909	Their	5171	” “
122029	122039	122040	122042	None of them	516	” She thought a while , steadily and wearily . “
122044	122050	122040	122042	None of them	516	” she said at last . “
122063	122109	122110	122110	I	0	” She thought gravely some moments again . Although a certain terse and even poetic utterance was the shape which her spoken imagination naturally took at all times , ignorance and solitude had made it hard for her aptly to marry her thoughts to words . “
122115	122122	122110	122110	I	0	” she said , wearily afresh . “
122398	122405	122392	122392	he	942	” Arslàn smiled as he heard . “
122490	122638	122470	122470	you	3030	” She did not understand him ; but she felt that she was honoured by him , and not scorned as others scorned her , for being thus unlike humanity . It was a bitter perplexity to her , this earth on which she had been flung amidst an alien people ; that she should suffer herself seemed little to her , it had become as a second nature ; but the sufferings of all the innumerable tribes of creation , things of the woods , and the field , and the waters , and the sky , that toiled and sweated and were hunted , and persecuted and wrenched in torment , and finally perished to gratify the appetites or the avarice of humanity , these sufferings were horrible to her always : inexplicable , hideous , unpardonable,—a crime for which she hated God and Man . “
122646	122653	122654	122655	no god	2988	” she said , at length , “
122660	122661	122654	122655	no god	2988	” “
122666	122683	122654	122655	no god	2988	” he answered her , as he motioned towards the three brethren that watched above her . “
122689	122708	122709	122709	My	0	” A smile that moved her to a certain fear of him passed a moment over his mouth . “
122726	122727	122712	122712	They	3033	” “
122733	122734	122730	122730	yours	3034	” “
122758	122809	122748	122748	I	0	” She looked at him in awe and in reverence . She imagined him the priest of some dark and terrible religion , for whose sake he lapsed his years in solitude and deprivation , and by whose powers he created the wondrous shapes that rose and bloomed around him . “
122815	122829	122812	122813	gentler gods	3039	” she said timidly , raising her eyes to the brethren above her . “
122841	122842	122843	122843	I	0	” “
122892	122893	122887	122887	his	3041	” “
122900	122901	122895	122896	that god	3043	” “
122904	122937	122938	122938	He	3043	” She was silent . Was this god not her god also ? Had she not chosen him , and laid her life down at his feet for this man ’s sake ? “
122946	123895	122938	122938	He	3043	” she said again in her heart . And Thanatos she knew would not betray her ; for Thanatos keeps all the secrets of men — he , who alone of the gods reads the truths of men ’s souls , and smiles , and shuts them in the hollow of his hand , and lets the braggart Time fly on with careless feet , telling what lies he will to please the world a little space . Thanatos holds silence and can wait;—for him must all things ripen , and , at last , to him must all things fall . WHEN she left him that night , and went homeward , he trimmed his lamp and returned to his labours of casting and modelling from the body of the rag‐picker ’s daughter . The work soon absorbed him too entirely to leave any memory with him of the living woman . He did not know — and had he known would not have heeded — that instead of going on her straight path back to Yprès she turned again , and , hidden amongst the rushes upon the bank , crouched half sitting and half kneeling , to watch him from the river‐side . It was all dark and still , without ; nothing came near , except now and then some hobbled mule turned out to forage for his evening meal , or some night‐browsing cattle straying out of bounds . Once or twice a barge went slowly and sullenly by , its single light twinkling across the breadth of the stream , and the voice of its steersman calling huskily through the fog . A drunken peasant staggered across the fields singing snatches of a republican march that broke roughly on the silence of the night . The young lambs bleated to their mothers in the meadows , and the bells of the old clock towers in the town chimed the quarters with a Laus Deo in which all their metal tongues joined musically . She remained there undisturbed amongst the long grasses and the tufts of the reeds , gazing always into the dimly‐lighted interior where the pale rays of the oil flame lit up the white forms of the gods , the black shadows of the columns , the shapes of the wrestling lion and the strangled gladiator , the grey stiff frame and hanging hair of the dead body , and the bending figure of Arslàn as he stooped above the corpse and pursued the secret powers of his art into the hidden things of death . To her there seemed nothing terrible in a night thus spent , in a vigil thus ghastly ; it seemed to her only a part of his strength thus to make death,—men ’s conqueror,—his servant and his slave ; she only begrudged every passionless touch that his grasp gave to those frozen and rigid limbs which he moved to and fro like so much clay ; she only envied with a jealous thirst every cold caress that his hand lent to that loose and lifeless hair which he swept aside like so much flax . He did not see ; he did not know . To him she was no more than any bronze‐winged , golden‐eyed insect that should have floated in on a night breeze and been painted by him and been cast out again upon the darkness . He worked more than half the night — worked until the small store of oil he possessed burned itself out , and left the hall to the feeble light of a young moon shining through dense vapours . He dropped his tools , and rose and walked to and fro on the width of the stone floor . His hands felt chilled to the bone with the contact of the dead flesh ; his breathing felt oppressed with the heavy humid air that lay like ice upon his lungs . The dead woman was nothing to him . He had not once thought of the youth that had perished in her ; of the laughter that hunger had hushed for ever on the colourless lips ; of the passion blushes that had died out for ever on the ashen cheeks ; of the caressing hands of mother and of lover that must have wandered amongst that curling hair ; of the children that should have slept on that white breast so smooth and cold beneath his hand . For these he cared nothing , and thought as little . The dead girl for him had neither sex nor story ; and he had studied all phases and forms of death too long to be otherwise than familiar with them all . Yet a certain glacial despair froze his heart as he left her body , lying there in the flicker of the struggling moonbeams , and , himself , pacing to and fro in his solitude , suffered a greater bitterness than death in his doom of poverty and of obscurity . The years of his youth had gone in fruitless labour , and the years of his manhood were gliding after them , and yet he had failed so utterly to make his mark upon his generation that he could only maintain his life by the common toil of the common hand‐labourer , and , if he died on the morrow , there would not be one hand stretched out to save any one work of his creation from the housewife ’s fires or the lime‐burner ’s furnace . Cold to himself as to all others , he said bitterly in his soul , “
123918	124312	124315	124315	God	118	” He told himself that harsh and inexorable truth a score of times , again and again , as he walked backward and forward in the solitude which only that one dead woman shared . He told himself that he was a madman , a fool , who spent his lifetime in search and worship of a vain eidolon . He told himself that there must be in him some radical weaknesses , some inalienable fault , that he could not in all these years find strength enough to compel the world of men to honour him . Agony overcame him as he thought and thought and thought , until he scorned himself ; the supreme agony of a strong nature that for once mistrusts itself as feebleness , of a great genius that for once despairs of itself as self‐deception . Had he been the fool of his vanities all his youth upward ; and had his fellow‐men been only wise and clear of sight when they had denied him and refused to see excellence in any work of his hand ? Almost , he told himself , it must be so . He paused by the open casement , and looked outward , scarcely knowing what he did . The mists were heavy ; the air was loaded with damp exhalations ; the country was profoundly still ; above‐head only a few stars glimmered here and there through the haze . The peace , the silence , the obscurity were abhorrent to him ; they seemed to close upon him , and imprison him ; far away were all the colour and the strength and the strain and the glory of living ; it seemed to him as though he were dead also , like the woman on the tressel yonder ; dead in some deep sea grave where the weight of the waters kept him down and held his hands powerless , and shut his eyelids from all sight , while the living voices and the living footsteps of men came dimly on his ear from the world above ; voices not one of which uttered his name ; footsteps , not one of which paused by his tomb . It grew horrible to him — this death‐in‐life , to which in the freshness of manhood he often himself condemned . “
124317	124330	124315	124315	God	118	” he , who believed in no God , muttered half aloud , “
124461	124490	124491	124493	One mortal listener	3050	“ We are born but to perish ; is Humanity a thing so high or pure that it should not claim exemption for the universal and inexorable law ? ”
124923	124932	124933	124933	she	3051	“ The gods gave me life for him , ”
124936	124949	124933	124933	she	3051	“ His life instead of mine ? Will they forget?—Will they forget ? ”
124977	124982	124983	124983	she	3051	“ Oh , Immortals ! ”
124993	125078	124983	124983	she	3051	“ remember to give me his life and take mine . Do what you choose with me ; forsake me , kill me ; cast my body to fire , and my ashes to the wind ; let me be trampled like the dust , and despised as the chaff ; let me be bruised , beaten , nameless , hated always ; let me always suffer and always be scorned ; but grant me this one thing — to give him his desire ! ”
127499	127519	127520	127523	the people of Yprès	3138	“ WHAT has come to that evil one ? She walks the land as though she were a queen , ”
128618	128671	128612	128612	they	2248	“ She has found a lover,—oh ho!—that brown wicked thing . A lover meet for her;—a man who walks abroad in the moonless nights , and plucks the mandrake , and worships the devil , and paints people in their own likeness , so that as the colour dries the life wastes ! ”
128956	128964	128953	128953	she	3093	him—“it is well enough with me now . ”
129137	129141	129142	129142	she	915	“ See here , ”
129145	129204	129142	129142	she	915	“ you are feeble and I am strong . I know every nook and corner in the woods . I know a hundred rare herbs that you never find . I will bring you a basketful of them twice in each week , if you will show me how to read those signs that the people call letters . ”
129210	129235	129205	129207	The old woman	334	“ It were as much as my life is worth to have you seen with me . The lads will stone my window . Still—. ”
129801	129808	129792	129792	he	172	“ If only you were not so ignorant!”—and
129856	129869	129870	129870	He	172	“ The characters that men print are no longer riddles to me . ”
130383	130389	130390	130390	he	172	“ What is the use ? ”
130402	130586	130390	130390	he	172	“ What is the use ? If I die tomorrow they will sell for so much rubbish to heat a bakery store . It is only a mad waste of hours — waste of colour , of canvas , of labour . The world has told me so , many years . The world always knows what it wants . It selects unerringly . It must judge better than I do . The man is a fool , indeed , who presumes himself to be wiser than all his generation . If the world will have nothing to do with you , go and hang yourself — or if you fear to do that , dig a ditch or a grave for a daily meal . Give over dreams . The world knows what it wants , and if it wanted you would take you . It has brazen lungs to shout for what it needs ; the lungs of a multitude . It is no use what your own voice whispers you unless those great lungs also shout before you , Hosannah . ”
130660	130666	130667	130667	she	104	“ Of a winter night , ”
130672	130776	130667	130667	she	104	“ I have heard old Pitchou read aloud to Flamma , and she reads of their God , the one they hang everywhere on the crosses here ; and the story ran that the populace scourged and nailed to death the one whom they knew afterwards , when too late , to have been the great man that they looked for , and that , being bidden to make their choice of one to save , they chose to ransom and honour a thief : one called Barabbas . Is it true?—If the world ’s choice were wrong once , why not twice ? ”
130802	130918	130919	130919	She	104	“ Why not twice ? Why not a thousand times ? A thief has the world ’s sympathies always . It is always the Barabbas — the trickster in talent , the forger of stolen wisdom , the bravo of political crime , the huckster of plundered thoughts , the charlatan of false art , whom the vox populi elects and sets free , and sends on his way rejoicing . ‘ Will ye have Christ or Barrabas ? ’ Every generation is asked the same question , and every generation gives the same answer ; and scourges the divinity out of its midst , and finds its idol in brute force and low greed . ”
130944	130949	130950	130950	she	104	“ But the end ? ”
130953	131012	130950	130950	she	104	“ The dead God is the God of all these people round us now , and they have built great places in his honour , and they bow when they pass his likeness in the highway or the market place . But with Barabbas — what was the end ? It seems that they loathe and despise him ? ”
131018	131168	131169	131169	He	3222	“ His end ? In Syria maybe the vultures picked his bones , where they lay whitening on the plains — those times were primitive , the world was young . But in our day Barabbas lives and dies in honour , and has a tomb that stares all men in the face , setting forth his virtues , so that all who run may read . In our day Barabbas — the Barabbas of money greeds and delicate cunning , and the theft which has risen to science , and the assassination that kills souls and not bodies , and the crime that deals moral death and not material death — our Barabbas , who is crowned Fraud in the place of mailed Force — lives always in purple and fine linen , and ends in the odours of sanctity with the prayers of priests over his corpse . ”
131258	131264	131265	131265	he	3222	“ Hush ! be quiet , ”
131273	131280	131265	131265	he	3222	“ I have thought of something . ”
131801	131804	131765	131766	the people	4948	“ Barabbas ! ”
132975	132982	132983	132983	he	172	“ But what were the use ? ”
132990	133015	132983	132983	he	172	“ What the use to be at pains to give it its full life on canvas ? No man will ever look on it . ”
133582	133589	133590	133590	he	172	“ Does it move you so ? ”
133595	133621	133590	133590	he	172	“ Well — the world refuses me fame ; but I do not know that the world could give me a higher tribute than yours . ”
133622	133626	133627	133627	she	3289	“ The world ? ”
133630	133645	133627	133627	she	3289	“ The world ? You care for the world — you?—who have painted that ? ”
133769	133774	133775	133775	he	172	“ Care ? I ? ”
133779	133865	133775	133775	he	172	“ We , who call ourselves poets or painters , can see the truth and can tell it — we are prophets so far ; but when we come down from our Horeb we hanker for the flesh‐pots and the dancing women , and the bags of gold , like all the rest . We are no better than those we preach to ; perhaps we are worse . Our eyes are set to the light ; but our feet are fixed in the mire . ”
134011	134020	134021	134021	he	172	“ And yet I desire nothing for myself , ”
134024	134043	134021	134021	he	172	“ I would lie down and die to‐morrow , gladly , did I know that they would live . ”
135516	135527	135529	135530	the gardener	5341	“ Is that all the devil has done for you ? ”
135551	135615	135544	135544	Yprès	11	“ It was scarcely worth while to be his offspring if he deal you no better gifts than that . He is as niggard as the saints are — the little mean beasts . Do you know that the man who paints you brings death they say — sooner or later — to every creature that lives again for him in his art ? ”
135667	135673	135674	135674	she	104	“ I have heard it , ”
135686	135693	135674	135674	she	104	“ And you have no fear ? ”
135694	135700	135701	135702	The gardener	5341	“ I have no fear . ”
135717	135823	135701	135702	The gardener	5341	“ Well — the devil gives strength , no doubt . But I will not say much for the devil ’s wage . A fine office he set you — his daughter — to lend yourself to a painter ’s eyes like any wanton that he could hire in the market‐place for a drink of wine . If the devil do no better than that for you — his own begotten,—I will cleave close to the saints and the angels henceforth , though they do take all the gems and the gold and the lace for their altars , and bestow so little in answer . ”
136794	136821	136822	136822	she	3348	“ Though I shall die as the leaf dies in my body , yet I shall live for ever embalmed amidst the beauty of his thoughts , ”
136870	136874	136875	136875	she	3348	“ The sea ! ”
136878	136883	136875	136875	she	3348	“ What is that ? ”
136884	136894	136895	136895	he	3362	“ Is it possible that you do not know ? ”
136900	136913	136875	136875	she	3348	wonder—“you who have lived all these years within two leagues of it ! ”
136914	136921	136922	136922	she	3348	“ I have heard of it , ”
136927	136937	136922	136922	she	3348	“ but I can not tell what it is . ”
136938	136984	136875	136875	she	3348	“ The man has never lived yet who could tell — in fit language . Poseidon is the only one of all the old gods of Hellas who still lives and reigns . We will go to his kingdom . Sight is better than speech . ”
137666	137678	137679	137679	he	3416	“ You find it hard to live apart from your kind ? ”
137718	137721	137856	137856	she	3348	“ To live apart?”—she
137726	137759	137760	137760	Her	3348	“ Yes — like this . To see no child smile , to hear no woman gossip , no man exchange good morrow with you . Is it any sorrow to you ? ”
137765	137796	137760	137760	Her	3348	“ What does it matter ? It is best so . One is free . One owes nothing — not so much as a fair word . That is well . ”
137797	137816	137679	137679	he	3416	“ I think it is well — if one is strong enough for it . It wants strength . ”
137817	137822	137823	137823	She	3348	“ I am strong . ”
137850	137855	137856	137856	she	3348	“ To live apart , ”
137870	137934	137856	137856	she	3348	“ I know what you mean — now . It is well — it is well with those men you tell me of when the world was young , who left all other men and went to live with the watercourse and the wild dove , and the rose and the palm , and the great yellow desert ; was it not well ? ”
137935	138015	138016	138016	Her	3434	“ So well with them that men worshipped them for it . But there is no such worship now . The cities are the kingdom of heaven ; not the deserts ; and he who hankers for the wilderness is stoned in the streets as a fool . And how should it be well with you , who have neither wild rose nor wild dove for compensation , but are only beaten and hooted , and hated and despised ? ”
138032	138117	138028	138028	she	3434	“ See here.—There is a pretty golden thing in the west road of the town who fears me horribly , Yvonne , the pottery painter ’s daughter . She says to her father at evening , ‘ I must go read the offices to old Mother Margot ; ’ and he says , ‘ Go , my daughter ; piety and reverence of age are twin blossoms off one stem of a tree that grows at the right hand of God in Paradise . ’ “
138153	138285	138288	138302	a woman who makes lace at the windows of the house against the fourth gate	3437	“ There is an old man at the corner of the market‐place , Ryno , the fruit seller , who says that I am accursed , and spits out at me as I pass . He says to the people as they go by his stall , ‘ See these peaches , they are smooth and rosy as a child ’s cheek ; sweet and firm ; not their like betwixt this and Paris . I will let you have them cheap , so cheap ; I need sorely to send money to my sick son in Africa . ’ And the people pay , greedily ; and when the peaches are home they see a little black speck in each of them , and all save their bloom is rottenness . “
138434	138629	138630	138630	You	3449	” She spoke with aa thoughtful and fierce earnestness , not witting of the caustic in her own words , meaning simply what she said , and classing the kisses of men as some sort of weakness and vileness , like those of a theft and a lie ; as she had come to do out of a curious , proud , true instinct that was in her , and not surely from the teaching of any creature . She in her way loved the man who walked beside her ; but it was a love of which she was wholly unconscious ; a pity , a sorrow , a reverence , a cultus , a deification , all combined , that had little or nothing in common with the loves of human kind , and which still left her speech as free , and her glance as fearless , with him as with any other . He knew that ; and he did not care to change it ; it was singular , and gave her half her charm of savagery and innocence commingled . He answered her merely , with a smile : “
138705	138706	138698	138698	I	0	” “
138718	138901	138902	138902	I	0	” she answered him with a curl of the mouth , and a gleam in her eyes : the pride of the old nomadic tribes , whose blood was in her , asserting itself against the claimed superiority of the tamed and hearth‐bound races — blood that ran free and fearless to the measure of boundless winds and rushing waters ; that made the forest and the plain , the dawn and the darkness , the flight of the wild roe and the hiding‐place of the wood‐pigeon , dearer than any roof‐tree , sweeter than any nuptial bed . She had left the old life so long;—so long that even her memories of it were dim as dreams , and its language had died off her lips in all save the broken catches of her songs ; but the impulses of it were in her , vivid and ineradicable , and the scorn with which the cowed and timid races of shed and of homestead regarded her , she , the daughter of Taric , gave back to them in tenfold measure . “
138910	138914	138907	138907	they	3454	” she repeated . “
139055	139123	139047	139047	I	0	” And her spirits rose , and her earliest life in the Liébana seemed to flash on her for one moment clear and bright through the veil of the weary years , and she walked erect and swiftly through the gorse , singing by his side the bold burden of one of the old sweet songs . And for the first time the thought passed over Arslàn , “
139145	139603	139142	139142	I	0	” Whether or not he chose he was not sure . She was beautiful in her way ; barbaric , dauntless , innocent , savage ; he cared to hurt , to please , to arouse , to study , to pourtray her ; but to seek love from her he did not care . And yet she was most lovely in her own wild fashion , like a young desert mare , or a seagull on the wing ; and he wondered to himself that he cared for her no more , as he moved beside her through the thickets of the gorse and against the strong winds blowing from the sea . There was so little passion in him . He had tossed aside the hair of dead women and pourtrayed the limbs and the features of living ones till that ruthless pursuit had brought its own penalty with it ; and the beauty of women scarcely moved him more than did the plumage of a bird or the contour of a marble . His senses were drugged , and his heart was dead ; it was well that it should be so , he had taught himself to desire it ; and yet—. As they left the cliff road for the pathless downs that led toward the summit of the rocks , they passed by a little way‐side hut , red with climbing creepers , and all alone on the sandy soil , like the little nest of a yellowhammer . Through its unclosed shutter the light of the sun streamed on to the pathway ; the interior was visible . It was very poor ; a floor of mud , a couch of rushes ; a hearth on which a few dry sticks were burning ; walls lichen‐covered and dropping moisture . Before the sticks , kneeling and trying to take them burn up more brightly to warm the one black pot that hung above them , was a poor peasant girl , and above her leaned a man who was her lover , a fisher of the coast , as poor , as hardy , and as simple as herself . In the man ’s eyes the impatience of love was shining , and as she lifted her head , after breathing with all her strength on the smoking sticks , he bent and drew her in his arms and kissed her rosy mouth and the white lids that drooped over her blue smiling northern eyes . She let the fuel lie still to blaze or smoulder as it would , and leaned her head against him , and laughed softly at his eagerness . Arslàn glanced at them as he passed . “
139607	139611	139604	139605	Poor brutes	3459	” he muttered . “
139642	139900	139637	139638	a woman	4876	” Folle‐Farine , hearing him , paused , and looked also . She trembled suddenly , and walked on in silence . A new light broke on her , and dazzled her , and made her afraid : this forest‐born creature , who had never known what fear was . The ground ascended as it stretched seaward , but on it there were only wide dull fields of colza or of grass lying , sickly and burning , under the fire of the late afternoon sun . The slope was too gradual to break their monotony . Above them was the cloudless weary blue ; below them was the faint parched green ; other colour there was none ; one little dusky panting bird flew by pursued by a kite ; that was the only change . She asked him no questions ; she walked mutely and patiently by his side ; she hated the dull heat , the colourless waste , the hard scorch of the air , the dreary changelessness of the scene . But she did not say so . He had chosen to come to them . A league onward the fields were merged into a heath , uncultivated and covered with short prickly furze ; on the brown earth between the stunted bushes a few groats were cropping the burnt‐up grasses . Here the slope grew sharper , and the earth seemed to rise up between the sky and them , steep and barren as a house‐roof . Once he asked her — “
139905	139906	139902	139902	you	3461	” “
140084	140088	140077	140077	he	3462	“ Now look . ”
140817	140824	140825	140825	he	172	“ What is it you feel ? ”
140887	140900	140865	140865	she	3497	“ It has been there always — always — so near me ? ”
140901	140910	140874	140874	she	3497	“ Before the land , the sea was . ”
140911	140918	140919	140919	Her	3497	“ And I never knew ! — ”
140964	140969	140970	140970	he	172	“ You never knew , ”
140974	141003	140970	140970	he	172	“ There was only a sand‐hill between you and all this glory ; but the sand‐hill was enough . Many people never climb theirs all their lives long . ”
141202	141211	141197	141197	he	172	“ Since it pains you , come away . ”
141219	141225	141226	141226	she	3497	“ Give me that pain , ”
141229	141248	141226	141226	she	3497	“ sooner than any joy . Pain ? Pain ? — it is life , heaven , liberty ! ”
141670	141678	141679	141679	he	172	“ This is but a land‐locked bay , ”
141703	141730	141686	141686	he	172	“ and it lies quiet enough there , like a duck pool , in the twilight . Tell me , why does it move you so ? ”
141739	141748	141731	141731	She	3497	“ It looks so free . And I — ”
141910	141916	141919	141919	he	172	“ It is not free , ”
141923	142013	141919	141919	he	172	“ It obeys the laws that govern it , and can not evade them . Its flux and reflux are not liberty , but obedience — just such obedience to natural law as our life shows when it springs into being and slowly wears itself out and then perishes in its human form to live again in the motes of the air and the blades of the grass . There is no such thing as liberty ; men have dreamed of it , but nature has never accorded it . ”
142070	142076	142077	142077	she	3497	“ It is so free ! ”
142085	142138	142077	142077	she	3497	“ if I had only known — I would have asked it to take me so long ago . To float dead on it — as that bird floats — it would be so quiet there : and it would not fling me back , I think . It would have pity . ”
142156	142162	142163	142163	he	172	“ Is it too late ? ”
142178	142188	142163	142163	he	172	“ Can you have grown in love with life ? ”
142189	142193	142194	142194	she	3497	“ You live , ”
142252	142258	142259	142259	he	172	“ Let us go down ! ”
142267	142272	142259	142259	he	172	“ it grows late . ”
142798	142806	142807	142807	he	6434	“ What are you thinking of to‐night ? ”
142844	142880	142833	142833	She	3544	“ I was thinking,—I wonder what the reed felt that you told me of,—the one reed that a god chose from all its millions by the waterside and cut down to make into a flute . ”
142881	142913	142807	142807	he	6434	“ Ah?—you see there are no reeds that make music now‐a‐days ; the reeds are only good to be woven into kreels for the fruits and the fish of the market . ”
142914	142924	142833	142833	She	3544	“ That is not the fault of the reeds ? ”
142925	142974	142833	142833	She	3544	“ Not that I know ; it is the fault of men most likely who find the chink of coin in barter sweeter music than the song of the syrinx . But what do you think the reed felt then?—pain to be so sharply severed from its fellows ? ”
142975	142987	142807	142807	he	6434	“ No — or the god would not have chosen it . ”
142988	142992	142833	142833	She	3544	“ What then ? ”
143046	143137	143138	143138	Arslàn	172	“ I was trying to think . But I can not be sure . These reeds have forgotten . They have lost their soul . They want nothing but to feed among the sand and the mud , and grow in millions together , and shelter the toads and the newts,—there is not a note of music in them all — except when the wind rises and makes them sigh , and then they remember that long , long ago , the breath of a great god was in them . ”
143219	143261	143207	143207	He	172	“ Look : away over the fields , there comes a peasant with a sickle ; he comes to mow down the reeds to make a bed for his cattle . If he heard you , he would think you mad . ”
143262	143275	143207	143207	He	172	“ They have thought me many things worse . What matter ? ’ “
143298	143299	143283	143283	you	172	” “
143304	143305	143283	143283	you	172	” “
143358	143359	143362	143362	you	172	” “
143365	143379	143362	143362	you	172	” Her voice was low , and thrilled with a curious eager pain . “
143385	143389	143382	143382	you	172	” she murmured . “
143672	143783	143665	143666	a god	942	” Her face lightened with a radiance to which the passion of her words was pale and poor ; the vibrations of her voice grew sonorous and changing as the sounds of music itself ; her eyes beamed through unshed tears as planets through the rain . She spoke of the reed and the god:—she thought of herself and of him . He was silent . The reaper came nearer to them through the rosy haze of the evening , and cast a malignant eye upon them , and bent his back and drew the curve of his hook through the rushes . Arslàn watched the sweep of the steel . “
143793	143804	143665	143666	a god	942	” He said , with a smile that was cruel . “
143814	144034	143812	143812	Folle‐Farine	104	” She did not understand ; but her face lost its colour , her heart sunk , her lips closed . She went on , treading down the long coils of the wild strawberries and the heavy grasses wet with the dew . The glow from the west died , a young moon rose , the fields and the skies grew dark . He looked , and let her go;—alone . In this stray offspring of a cruel chance , Hermes , pitiful for once , had given him a reed through which all sweetest and noblest music might have been breathed . But Hermes , when he gives such a gift , leaves the mortal on whom he bestows it to make or to miss the music as he may ; and to Arslàn , his reed was but a reed as the rest were — a thing that bloomed for a summer‐eve — a thing of the stagnant water and drifting sand — a thing that lived by the breath of the wind — a thing that a man should cut down and weave in a crown for a day , and then cast aside on the stream , and neither regret nor in anywise remember — a reed of the river , as the rest were . “
144040	144053	143812	143812	Folle‐Farine	104	” he thought , one day , looking on the Barabbas cartoon . “
144091	144516	144088	144088	me	0	” The thought escaped him unawares in broken words , one day , when he thought himself alone . This was a perpetual torture to him , this captivity and penury , this aimlessness and fruitlessness , in which his years were drifting , spent in the dull bodily labour that any brainless human brute could execute as well as he , consuming his days in physical fatigue in order that a roof he despised might cover him , and a bread which was bitter as gall to him might be his to eat ; knowing all the while that the real strength which he possessed , the real power that could give him an empire amidst his fellows , was dying away in him as slowly but as surely as though his brain were feasting fishes in the river mud below . So little!—just a few handfuls of that wealth that cheats and wantons , fools and panders , gathered and scattered so easily in that world with which he had now no more to do than if he were lying in his grave,—and having this little , he would be able to compel the gaze of the world , and arouse the homage of its flinching fear , even if it should still continue to deny him other victories . It was not the physical privations of poverty which could daunt him . His boyhood had been spent in a health‐giving and simple training , amidst a strong and hardy mountain‐ people . It was nothing to him to make his bed on straw ; to bear hunger unblenchingly ; to endure cold and heat , and all the freaks and changes of wild weather . In the long nights of a northern winter he had fasted for weeks on a salted fish and a handful of meal ; on the polar seas he had passed a winter ice‐blocked , with famine kept at bay only by the flesh of the seal , and men dying around him raving in the madness of thirst . None of the physical ills of poverty could appal him ; but its imprisonment , its helplessness , the sense of utter weakness , the impotence to rise and go to other lands and other lives , the perpetual narrowness and darkness in which it compelled him to abide , all these were horrible to him ; he loathed them as a man loathes the irons on his wrists , and the stone vault of his prison‐cell . “
144523	144532	144088	144088	me	0	” he muttered , looking on his Barabbas , “
144541	144840	144088	144088	me	0	” For he knew that if he had as much gold as he had thrown away in earlier times to the Syrian beggar who had sat to him on his house‐top at Damascus , he could go to a city and make the work live in colour , and try once more to force from men that wonder and that fear which are the highest tributes that the multitude can give to the genius which arises amidst it . There was no creature in the chamber with him , except the spiders that wove in the darkness among the timbers . It was only just then dawn . The birds were singing in the thickets of the water ’s edge ; a blue kingfisher skimmed the air above the rushes , and a dragon‐fly hunted insects over the surface of the reeds by the shore ; the swallows , that built in the stones of the tower , were wheeling to and fro , glad and eager for the sun . Otherwise it was intensely silent . In the breadth of shadow still cast across the stream by the walls of the tower , the market‐boat of Yprès glided by , and the soft splash of the passing oars was a sound too familiar to arouse him . But , unseen , Folle‐Farine , resting one moment in her transit to look up at that grim grey pile in which her paradise was shut , watching and listening with the fine‐strung senses of a great love , heard through the open casement the muttered words which , out of the bitterness of his heart , escaped his lips unconsciously . She heard and understood . Although a paradise to her , to him it was only a prison . “
144877	145589	144852	144852	they	3565	” she thought , as she went on her way noiselessly down with the ebb tide on the river . And she sorrowed exceedingly for his sake . She knew nothing of all that he remembered in the years of his past — of all that he had lost , whilst yet young , as men should only lose their joys in the years of their old age ; she knew nothing of the cities and the habits of the world — nothing of the world ’s pleasures and the world ’s triumphs . To her it had always seemed strange that he wanted any other life than this which he possessed . To her , the freedom , the strength , the simplicity of it , seemed noble , and all that the heart of a man could desire from fate . Going forth at sunrise to his daily labour on the broad golden sheet of the waters , down to the sight and the sound and the smell of the sea , and returning at sunset to wander at will through the woods and the pastures in the soft evening shadows ; free to watch and pourtray with the turn of his wrist the curl of each flower , the wonder of every cloud , the smile in any woman ’s eyes , the gleam of any moonbeam through the leaves ; or to lie still on the grass , or the sand by the shore , and see the armies of the mists sweep by over his head , and hearken to the throb of the nightingale ’s voice through the darkness , and gather the coolness of the dews in the hollow of his hand , and let the night go by in dreams of worlds beyond the stars;—such a life as this seemed to her beyond any other beautiful . A life in the air , on the tide , in the light , in the wind , in the sound of salt waves , in the smell of wild thyme , with no roof to come between him and the sky , with no need to cramp body and mind in the cage of a street — a life spent in the dreaming of dreams , and full of vision and thought as the summer was full of its blossoms and fruits,—it seemed to her the life that must needs be best for a man , since the life that was freest , simplest , and highest . She knew nothing of the lust of ambition , of the desire of fame , of the ceaseless unrest of the mind which craves the world ’s honour , and is doomed to the world ’s neglect ; of the continual fire which burns in the hands which stretch themselves in conscious strength to seize a sceptre , and remain empty , only struck in the palm by the buffets of fools . Of these she knew nothing . She had no conception of them — of the weakness and the force that twine one in another in such a temper as his . She was at once above them and beneath them . She could not comprehend that he who could so bitterly disdain the flesh‐pots and the wine‐skins of the common crowd , yet could stoop to care for that crowd ’s Hosannas . But yet this definite longing which she overheard in the words that escaped him she could not mistake ; it was a longing plain to her , one that moved all the dullest and most brutal souls around her . All her years through she had seen the greed of gold , or the want of it , the twin rulers of the only little dominion that she knew . Money , in her estimate of it , meant only some little sum of copper pieces , such as could buy a hank of flax , a load of sweet chestnuts , a stack of wood , a swarm of bees , a sack of autumn fruits . What in cities would have been penury , was deemed illimitable riches in the homesteads and cabins which had been her only world . “
145596	145664	144852	144852	they	3565	” she pondered ceaselessly , as she went on down the current . She knew that he only craved it , not to purchase any pleasure for his appetites or for his vanities , but only as the lever whereby he would be enabled to lift off from him that iron weight of adverse circumstances which held him down darkness as the stones held the caged eagle . “
145669	145716	144852	144852	they	3565	” she said to herself again and again as the boat drifted on to the town , with the scent of the mulberries , and the herbs , and the basket of roses , which were its cargo for the market , fragrant on the air . “
145721	145788	144852	144852	they	3565	” It seemed so slight a thing , and the more cruel because so slight , to stand thus between him and that noonday splendour of fame which he sought to win , in his obscurity and indigence , as the blinded eagle in his den still turned his aching eyes by instinct to the sun . Her heart was weary for him as she went . “
145801	145805	145792	145793	the gods	1366	” she thought , “
145822	145846	144852	144852	they	3565	” It was a gift as poisoned , a granted prayer as vain , as the immortality which they had given to Tithonus . “
145851	146023	144852	144852	they	3565	” he had said : it seemed a thing almost within her grasp . Had she been willing to steal from Flamma , she could have taken it as soon as the worth of the load which she carried should have been paid to her ; but by a theft she would not serve Arslàn now . No gifts would she give him but what should be pure and worthy of his touch . She pondered and pondered , cleaving the waters with regular measures , and gliding under the old stone arches of the bridge into the town . When she brought the boat back up the stream at noonday , her face had cleared ; her mouth smiled ; she rowed on swiftly , with a light sweet and glad in her eyes . A thought had come to her . In the market‐place that day she had heard two women talk together , under the shade of their great red umbrellas , over their heaps of garden produce . “
146039	146040	146034	146034	Thou	3569	” “
146134	146135	146111	146111	he	1305	” “
146145	146211	146111	146111	he	1305	“ No,—only a few little shabby , bent pieces . But the lad took them up to the Prince Sartorian , and he is always crazed about the like ; and he sent us for them quite a roll of gold , and said that the coins found were , beyond a doubt , of the Julain time — whatever he might mean by that . ”
146212	146247	146111	146111	he	1305	“ Sartorian will buy any rubbish of that sort . For my part , I think if one buried a brass button only long enough , he would give one a bank‐note for it . ”
146248	146362	146111	146111	he	1305	“ They say there are marble creatures of his that cost more than would dower a thousand brides , or pension a thousand soldiers . I do not know about that . My boy did not get far in the palace ; but he said that the hall he waited in was graven with gold and precious stones . One picture he saw in it was placed on a golden altar , as if it were a god . To worship old coins , and rags of canvas , and idols of stone like that,—how vile it is ! while we are glad to get a nettle‐salad off the edge of the road . ”
146363	146373	146111	146111	he	1305	“ But the coins gave thee the brindled calf . ”
146374	146390	146111	146111	he	1305	“ That was no goodness to us . Sartorian has a craze for such follies . ”
146405	146415	146416	146417	The women	472	“ Who is Sartorian ? Will you tell me ? ”
146447	146454	146455	146455	they	3574	“ He is a great noble , ”
146464	146471	146455	146455	they	3574	“ And where is his dwelling ? ”
146472	146490	146491	146491	She	104	“ Near Rioz . What do the like of you want with the like of the Prince ? ”
146511	146531	146533	146534	the women	472	“ What is that wicked one thinking of now , that she asks for such as the Prince Sartorian ? ”
146575	146605	146571	146571	his	3583	“ Maybe she knows that Sartorian will give yet more gold for new faces than for old coins ; and — how handsome she is , the black‐browed witch ! ”
146622	146637	146638	146638	she	104	“ I go to Rioz myself in two days ’ time with the mules , ”
146927	146937	146921	146921	her	104	“ Wake ! I want a word with you . ”
146964	146997	147001	147001	her	104	“ Listen ! The night I was brought here you stole the sequins off my head . Give them back to me now , or I will kill you where you lie . ”
147192	147209	147210	147210	she	104	“ How can you complain of me , without telling also of your own old sin ? ”
147222	147267	147210	147210	she	104	“ Shriek away as you choose : the chain is mine , not yours . I was weak when you stole it ; I am strong enough now . You had best not meddle , or you will have the worst of the reckoning . ”
147756	147766	147767	147767	she	104	“ I would never part with them for myself , ”
147770	147783	147767	147767	she	104	“ I would die of hunger first — were it only myself . ”
147884	147925	147877	147877	she	104	“ I go to Rioz with the two mules , at daybreak to‐morrow , with flour for Flamma . It is a town , larger than the one yonder . Is there anything I might do there — for you ? ”
147926	147934	147935	147935	he	172	“ Do ? What should you do ? ”
148002	148016	148017	148017	she	104	“ If it come to nought he had best not know , perhaps , ”
148568	148580	148563	148564	the market‐woman	3649	“ What does the like of you want with the Prince ? ”
148581	148601	148602	148602	she	104	“ I want to know the way to it . If you do not tell it , another will , ”
148657	148668	148669	148669	she	3647	“ What is this baggage wanting to do with Sartorian ? ”
148687	148694	148696	148697	her assistant	3657	“ Some evil , no doubt , ”
148712	148753	148754	148756	Her old mistress	3660	“ You know , she sells bags of wind to founder the ships , they say , and the wicked herb , bon plaisir , and the philtres that drive men mad . She is as bad as a cagote . ”
148776	148812	148774	148774	herself	3660	“ No one would ask the road there for any good ; that is sure . No doubt she has heard that Sartorian is a choice judge of colour and shape in all the Arts ! ”
148982	149001	148968	148968	his	3664	“ There goes a handsome piece of porcelain for the old man to lock in his velvet‐lined cupboards . ”
149009	149026	149003	149004	the wife	3669	“ Ay ; she will look well , gilded as Sartorian always gilds what he buys . ”
149959	149966	149967	149967	she	3647	“ And he cares for that ! ”
150008	150015	150026	150036	a small and feeble man , with keen and humorous eyes	3709	“ Who is ‘ he ’ ? ”
150089	150094	150095	150095	she	3647	“ Who are you ? ”
150109	150119	150103	150106	The little old man	3710	“ I have the honour to be your host . ”
150127	150134	150135	150135	she	3647	“ You ! are you Sartorian ? ”
150136	150144	150103	150106	The little old man	3710	muttered—“the Sartorian whom they call a prince ? ”
150145	150149	150150	150150	he	3701	“ Even I , ”
150156	150184	150185	150185	He	3701	“ I regret that I please you no more . May I ask to what I am indebted for your presence ? You seem a fastidious critic . ”
150236	150267	150229	150229	he	3701	“ How did you come in hither ? You care for pictures , perhaps , since you seem to feed on them like some wood‐pigeon on a sheaf of corn ? ”
150268	150276	150277	150277	she	3647	“ I know of finer than yours , ”
150297	150328	150329	150329	She	3647	“ I did not come to see anything you have . I came to sell you these : they say in Yprès that you care for such bits of coin . ”
150397	150402	150387	150387	He	3701	“ Whose were these ? ”
150413	150442	150403	150403	She	3647	“ They are mine . If you want such things , as they say you do , take them and give me their value — that is all . ”
150443	150452	150496	150496	Her	3647	“ Do you come her to sell them ? ”
150453	150483	150403	150403	She	3647	“ Yes . I came three leagues to‐day . I heard a woman from near Rioz say that you liked such things . Take them , or leave them . ”
150484	150491	150403	150403	She	3647	“ Who gave them to you ? ”
150492	150495	150496	150496	Her	3647	“ Phratos . ”
150512	150519	150520	150520	Her	3647	“ And who may Phratos be ? ”
150527	150559	150520	150520	Her	3647	“ That is none of your business . If you think that I stole them , say so . If you want them , buy them . One or the other . ”
150567	150574	150575	150575	he	335	“ You can be very fierce , ”
150580	150599	150575	150575	he	335	“ Be gentle a little , and tell me whence you came , and what story you have . ”
150605	150616	150617	150617	she	3647	“ I have not come here to speak of myself , ”
150621	150632	150617	150617	she	3647	“ Will you take the coins , or leave them ? ”
150633	150639	150640	150640	he	335	“ I will take them , ”
150671	150676	150677	150677	he	335	“ Here is payment , ”
150715	150722	150723	150723	she	3647	“ All that — all that ? ”
150726	150736	150723	150723	she	3647	“ Is it their worth ? Are you sure ? ”
150737	150741	150742	150742	he	335	“ Quite sure , ”
150808	150813	150814	150814	she	3647	“ I am grateful , ”
150860	150867	150868	150868	he	335	“ They are not for yourself ? ”
150871	150877	150878	150878	she	3647	“ That is my affair , ”
150889	150897	150898	150898	He	335	“ What concerned you was their value . ”
150930	150954	150902	150902	his	335	” She looked awhile in his eyes steadily , then she brought the sketches from their hiding‐place . She placed them before him . “
150959	151014	150902	150902	his	335	” He took them to the light and scanned them slowly and critically ; he knew all the mysteries and intricacies of art , and he recognised in these slight things the hand and the colour of a master . He did not say so , but held them for some time in silence . “
151021	151078	150902	150902	his	335	” he asked , at length . She had drawn near him , her face flushed with intense expectation , her longing eyes dilated , her scarlet lips quivering with eagerness . That he was a stranger and a noble was nothing to her : she knew he had wealth ; she saw he had perception . “
151082	151102	150902	150902	his	335	” she said , swiftly , the music of her voice rising and falling in breathless , eloquent intonation . “
151368	151398	151354	151354	he	3719	” Her voice trembled , and was still for a second ; she struggled with herself and kept it clear and strong . The old man never interrupted her . “
151542	151589	151534	151534	he	3719	” She shivered as she spoke ; in her earnestness and eagerness , she laid her hand on the stranger arm , and held it there ; she prayed , with more passion than she would have cast into any prayer to save her own life . “
151601	151705	151597	151597	you	0	” the old man asked her quietly . He understood the meaning that ran beneath the unconscious extravagance of her faithful and impassioned language . He is called Arslàn ; he lives in the granary‐tower , by the river , between the town and Yprès . He comes from the north , far away — very , very far , where the seas are all ice and the sun shines at midnight . Will you make the things that he does to be known to the people ? You have gold ; and gold , he says , is the compeller of men . ”
151706	151709	151710	151710	he	3735	“ Arslàn ? ”
151768	151782	151849	151849	They	3738	“ Arslàn?—I think I remember . I will see what I can do . ”
151783	151793	151849	151849	They	3738	“ You will say nothing to him of me ? ”
151794	151810	151849	151849	They	3738	“ I could not say much . Who are you ? Whence do you come ? ”
151811	151839	151849	151849	They	3738	“ I live at the water‐mill of Yprès . They say that Reine Flamma was my mother . I do not know : it does not matter . “
151845	151846	151847	151847	Folle‐Farine	104	” “
151856	151857	151849	151849	They	3738	” “

151938	151941	151942	151942	she	0	“ No , ”
151952	152015	151942	151942	she	0	“ I do not care to do that . If I had cared to burn anything it would have been the Flandrin ’s village . It is odd that you should live in a palace and he should want for bread ; but then he can create things , and you can only buy them . So it is even , perhaps . ”
152023	152062	152016	152018	The old man	335	“ You are no respecter of persons , that is certain . Come in another chamber and take some wine , and break your fast . There will be many things here that you never saw or tasted . ”
152068	152076	152077	152077	she	0	“ The thought is good of you , ”
152088	152105	152077	152077	she	0	“ But I never took a crust out of charity , and I will not begin . ”
152106	152117	152077	152077	she	0	“ Charity ? Do you call an invitation a charity ? ”
152118	152128	152077	152077	she	0	“ When the rich ask the poor — yes . ”
152138	152165	152077	152077	she	0	“ But when a man , old and ugly , asks a woman that is young and beautiful , on which side lies the charity then ? ”
152166	152174	152175	152175	she	0	“ I do not favour fine phrases , ”
152187	152210	152211	152211	She	0	“ You are hard to please in anything , it would seem . Well , come hither , a moment at least . ”
152365	152382	152352	152352	she	0	“ However they may gild their roofs , the roofs shut out the sky no less . ”
152489	152495	152496	152496	he	335	“ Let me tempt you , ”
152506	152535	152496	152496	he	335	“ Sit down with me and eat and drink . No ? Taste these sweetmeats at the least . To refuse to break bread with me is churlish . ”
152536	152552	152553	152553	she	0	“ I never owed nay man a crust , and I will not begin now , ”
152685	152692	152693	152693	he	335	“ Your denial is very churlish , ”
152712	152748	152749	152749	She	0	“ How shall you bind me to keep bond with you , and rescue your Northern Regner from his cave of snakes , unless you break bread with me , and so compel my faith ? ”
152774	152781	152782	152782	she	0	“ A word that needs compelling , ”
152787	152820	152782	152782	she	0	“ is broken by the heart before the lips give it . It is to plant a tree without a root , to put faith in a man that needs a bond . ”
152831	152840	152841	152841	he	335	“ Where have you got all your wisdom ? ”
152844	152854	152821	152821	He	335	“ It is not wisdom ; it is truth . ”
152855	152871	152872	152872	She	0	“ And truth is not wisdom ? You would seem to know the world well . ”
152884	152902	152872	152872	She	0	“ I know it not at all . But I will tell you what I have seen . ”
152903	152909	152821	152821	He	335	“ And that is — ? ”
152910	152972	152821	152821	He	335	“ I have seen a great toadstool spring up all in one night , after rain , so big , and so white , and so smooth , and so round,—and I knew its birth was so quick , and its growth was so strong , because it was a false thing that would poison all who should eat of it . ”
152973	152976	152872	152872	She	0	“ Well ? ”
152977	152999	152821	152821	He	335	“ Well — when men speak over‐quick and over‐fair , what is that but the toadstool that springs from their breath ? ”
153000	153008	153009	153009	Her	0	“ Who taught you so much suspicion ? ”
153015	153037	153009	153009	Her	0	“ Suspicion ? That is a thing that steals in the dark and is afraid . I am afraid of nothing . ”
153038	153044	153045	153045	He	335	“ So it would seem . ”
153209	153217	153218	153218	she	0	“ They are beautiful , no doubt , ”
153222	153240	153218	153218	she	0	“ But I marvel that you — being a man — care for such things as these . ”
153241	153285	153286	153286	Her	0	“ Nay ; I care to give them to beautiful women , when such come to me,—as one has come to‐day . Do me one trifling grace ; choose some one thing at least out of these to keep in remembrance of me . ”
153292	153322	153286	153286	Her	0	“ If I think your bread would soil my lips , is it likely I should think to touch your treasure with my hands and have them still clean ? ”
153323	153329	153330	153330	he	3762	“ You are very perverse , ”
153388	153395	153396	153396	she	0	“ Are you the Red Mouse ? ”
153422	153429	153413	153413	he	3762	“ What makes you think that ? ”
153430	153514	153515	153515	He	3762	“ I do not know . You look like it — that is all . He has made one sketch of me as I shall be when I am dead ; and the Red Mouse sits on my chest , and it is glad . You see that , by its glance . I never asked him what he meant by it . Some evil , I think ; and you look like it . You have the same triumph in your eye . ”
153531	153569	153570	153570	She	0	“ He has painted you so ? I must see that . But believe me , Folle‐Farine , I shall wish for my triumph before your beauty is dead — if I am indeed the Red Mouse . ”
153583	153588	153589	153589	she	0	“ I must go , ”
153593	153607	153589	153589	she	0	“ The mules wait . Remember him , and I will remember you . ”
153611	153639	153608	153608	He	3762	“ Wait , have you thought what a golden key for him will do for you when it unlocks you eagle ’s cage and unbinds his wings ? ”
153640	153643	153644	153644	She	0	“ What ? ”
153671	153689	153608	153608	He	3762	“ Well , you look to take the same flight to the same heights , I suppose ? ”
153690	153693	153608	153608	He	3762	“ I ? ”
153694	153713	153608	153608	He	3762	“ Yes , you . You must know that you are beautiful . You must know so much ? ”
153725	153730	153731	153731	she	0	“ Ah , yes ! ”
153753	153786	153731	153731	she	0	“ He has painted me in a thousand ways . I shall live as the rose lives , on his canvas — a thing of a day that he can make immortal ! ”
153812	153874	153801	153801	he	335	“ And so , if this dust of oblivion blots out his canvas for ever from the world ’s sight , your beauty will be blotted with it ? I see . Well , I can understand how eager you are to have your eagle fly free . The fame of the Fornarina stands only second to the fame of Cleopatra . ”
153875	153882	153750	153750	her	0	“ Fornarina ? What is that ? ”
153883	153913	153914	153914	She	3764	“ Fornarina ? One who , like you , gave the day ’s life of a rose , and who got eternal fire for it,—as you think to do . ”
153939	153942	153943	153943	she	3764	“ I ? ”
153946	154037	153943	153943	she	3764	“ Ah , what does it matter for me ? If there be just a little place — anywhere — wherever my life can live with his on the canvas , so that men say once now and then , in all the centuries , to each other , ‘ See , it is true — he thought her worthy of that , though she was less than a grain of dust under the hollow of his foot , ’ it will be enough for me — more than enough . ”
154134	154260	154131	154131	he	335	“ But , if you were sure that even thus much would be denied to you ; if you were sure that , in casting your eagle loose on the wind , you would lose him for ever in the heights of a heaven you would never enter yourself ; if you were sure that he would never give you one thought , one wish , one memory , but leave every trace of your beauty to perish as fast as the damp could rot or the worm could gnaw it ; if you were sure that his immortality would be your annihilation , say , would you still bid me turn a gold key in the lock of his cage , and release him ? ”
154359	154366	154367	154367	she	3766	“ What is that to you ? ”
154372	154408	154367	154367	she	3766	“ If you turn the key , you will see . It was not of myself that I came here to speak . Give him liberty , and I will give you gratitude . Farewell . ”
154707	154732	154733	154733	she	3766	“ What will it matter how or when the gods take my life , so only they keep their faith and give me his ? ”
154803	154808	154809	154809	he	3780	“ A little gold , ”
155059	155064	155065	155065	he	3788	“ A little god , ”
155118	155119	155120	155120	Phratos	121	” “
155130	155213	155120	155120	Phratos	121	” she thought to herself , with a swift , penitent , remorseful memory . For a moment she paused and took them once more out of their hiding‐place , and undid the green leaf that enwrapped them , and kissed them and laughed , the hot tears falling down her cheeks , where she stood alone in the fields amid the honey‐smell of the clover in the grass , and the fruit‐fragrance of the orchards all about her in the dimness . “
155220	155250	155120	155120	Phratos	121	” she murmured , and she laughed aloud in her great joy , and blessed the gods that they had given her to hear the voice of his desire . “
155255	155541	155120	155120	Phratos	121	” he had said , only ; and here she had so much ! No sorcerer , she thought , ever had power wider than this wealth bestowed on her . She did not know ; she had no measurement . Flamma ’s eyes she had seen glisten over a tithe of such a sum as over the riches of an emperor ’s treasury . She slipped them in her breast again and ran on past the reeds silvering in the rising moon , past the waters quiet on a windless air , past the dark Christ who would not look,—who had never looked , or she had loved him with her earliest love , even as for his pity she loved Thanatos . Breathless and noiseless she severed the reeds with her swift feet , and lightly as a swallow on the wing passed through the dreary portals into Arslàn ’s chamber . His lamp was lighted . He stood before the cartoon of the Barabbas , touching it here and there with his charcoal , adding those latest thoughts , those after‐graces , with which the artist delights to caress his picture , with a hand as soft and as lingering as the hand with which a mother caresses the yellow sunshine of her first‐born ’s curls . His face as he stood was very pale , passionless , weary , with a sadness sardonic and full of scorn for himself on his mouth , and in his eyes those dreams which went so far — so far — into worlds whose glories his hand could pourtray for no human sight . He was thinking , as he worked , of the Barabbas . “
155546	155550	155551	155551	You	3790	” he thought . “
155669	155744	155660	155660	his	228	” There came a soft shiver of the air , as though it were severed by some eager bird . She came and stood beside him , a flash like the sunrise on her face , a radiance in her eyes more lustrous than any smile ; her body tremulous and breathless from the impatient speed with which her footsteps had been winged ; about her all the dew and fragrance of the night . “
155750	155766	155660	155660	his	228	” she cried . Her voice was eager and broken with its too great haste . “
155769	155789	155660	155660	his	228	” He turned and looked at her , ignorant of her meaning , astonished at her sudden presence there . “
155795	155820	155660	155660	his	228	” she murmured , her voice rising swift and clear , and full of the music of triumph with which her heart was thrilling . “
155852	155853	155848	155848	you	3794	” “
155856	155885	155940	155940	you	3794	” he echoed again , shaken from his trance of thought , and comprehending nothing and remembering nothing of the words that he had spoken in his solitude . “
155892	155903	155940	155940	you	3794	” she said , her voice broken in its tumult of ecstasy—“it
155966	156062	155958	155958	men	364	” As the impetuous , tremulous words broke from her , she drew the green leaf with the coins in it from her bosom , and thrust it in to his hand , eager , exultant , laughing , weeping , all the silence and the control of her nature swept away in the flood of this immeasurable joy possessing her . The touch of the glittering pieces against his hands stung him to comprehension ; his face flushed over all its pallor ; he thrust it away with a gesture of abhorrence and rejection . “
156065	156069	155958	155958	men	364	” he muttered . “
156073	156074	156077	156077	mine	0	” “
156083	156100	156142	156142	you	3798	” she answered , with a sweet , glad ring of victory in her rejoicing voice . “
156169	156273	156167	156167	yours	3799	” In the last words her voice lost all its proud exultation , and sank low , with a dull startled wonder in it . Why did he look so ? His gesture of refusal she had not noticed . But the language his glance spoke was one plain to her . It terrified her , amazed her , struck her chill and dumb . In it there was disgust , anger , loathing , even horror;—and yet there was in it also an unwonted softness , which in a woman ’s eyes would have shown itself by a rush of sudden tears . “
156283	156290	156276	156276	you	3798	” she murmured under her breath . “
156331	156332	156325	156325	you	3798	” “
156348	156370	156344	156344	you	3798	” She grew white to the lips , all the impetuous , radiant tumult of her innocent rapture frozen into terror . “
156377	156385	156398	156398	you	3798	” she murmured with a piteous wistfulness and wonder—“nothing
156407	156418	156398	156398	you	3798	” He turned on her with a severity almost savage . “
156454	156598	156445	156445	I	0	” His voice was choked in his throat ; he was wounded to the heart . He had no thought that he was cruel ; he had no intent to terrify or hurt her ; but the sting of this last and lowest humiliation was so horrible to all the pride of his manhood , and so bitterly reminded him of his own abject poverty ; and with all this there was an emotion in him that he had difficulty to control — being touched by her ignorance and by her gift as few things in his life had ever touched him . She stood before him trembling , wondering , sorely afraid ; all the light had died out of her face ; she was very pale , and her eyes dilated strangely . For some moments there was silence between them . “
156605	156638	156599	156599	You	3803	” she said at last , in a hushed , fearful voice , like that of one who speaks in the sight of some dead thing which makes all quiet around it . “
156642	156646	156647	156647	I	0	” he echoed . “
156772	156792	156809	156809	you	3803	” Her face burned duskily ; she moved with a troubled confused effort to get away from his gaze . “
156795	156803	156809	156809	you	3803	” she said in her shut teeth . “
156832	156833	156822	156822	you	3803	” “
156970	157006	156967	156967	You	3803	” She heard him in silence , her face still dark with the confused pain on it of one who has fallen or been struck upon the head , and half forgets and half remembers . “
157012	157016	156967	156967	You	3803	” she muttered . “
157049	157050	157046	157046	I	0	” “
157097	157204	157085	157085	you	3803	” Out of the bitter passion of his soul , words more cruel than he had consciousness of rose to his lips and leaped to speech , and stung her as scorpions sting . She said nothing ; her teeth clenched , her face changed as it had used to do when Flamma had beaten her . She said nothing , but turned away ; and with one twist of her hand she flung the pieces through the open casement into the river that flowed below . They sank with a little shiver of the severed water . He caught her wrist a second too late . “
157324	157374	157320	157320	I	0	” There was a softness that was almost tenderness in his voice as he spoke the last phrases in his self‐reproach ; but her face did not change , her eyes did not lose their startled horror ; she put her hand to her throat as though she choked . “
157384	157799	157375	157375	You	3803	” she muttered , true , even in such a moment , to the absolute adoration which possessed her . Then , ere he could stay her , she turned , without another word , and fled out from his presence into the dusk of the night . The rushes in the moonlight sighed where they grew by the water‐side above the sands where the gold had sunk . A thing more precious than gold was dead ; and only the reeds mourned for it . A thing of the river as they were , born like them from the dust , from the flood , from the wind and the foam ; a thing that a god might desire , a thing that a breeze might break . THE day broke tranquilly . There was a rosy light over all the earth . In the cornlands a few belated sheaves stood alone in the reaping‐ground , while children sought stray ears that might still be left amongst the wild flowers and the stubble . The smell of millions of ripening autumn fruits filled the air from the orchards . The women going to their labour in their fields , gave each other a quiet good day ; whilst their infants pulled down the blackberry branches in the lanes or bowled the early apples down the roads . Great clusters of black grapes were already mellowed on the vines that clambered over cabin roof and farmhouse chimney . The chimes of the earliest bells sounded softly from many a little steeple bosomed in the rolling woods . An old man going to his work passed by a girl lying asleep in a hollow of the ground , beneath a great tree of berries . She was lying with her face turned upward ; her arms above her head ; her eyelids were wet ; her mouth smiled a dreamy tenderness ; her lips murmured a little inaudibly ; her bosom heaved with fast uneven palpitating breaths . It was sunrise . In the elder thicket little chaffinches were singing , and a missel‐thrush gave late in the year a song of the April weather . The east was radiant with the promise of a fair day , in which summer and autumn should be wedded with gorgeous pomp of colour , and joyous chorus of the birds . The old man roughly thrust against her breast the heavy wooden shoe on his right foot . “
157803	157807	157375	157375	You	3803	” he muttered , “
157848	157916	157843	157844	an elf‐shot	3825	” She raised her head from where it rested on her out‐stretched arms , and looked him in the eyes and smiled unconsciously ; then glanced around and rose and dragged her steps away , in the passive mechanical obedience begotten by long slavery . There was a shiver in her limbs ; a hunted terror in her eyes ; she had wandered sleepless all night long . “
157919	157934	157843	157844	an elf‐shot	3825	” muttered the old man , trudging on with a backward glance at her . “
158006	158052	158105	158105	they	3829	” She went on through the long wet rank grass , not hearing his threats against her . She drew her steps slowly and lifelessly through the heavy dews ; her hand was sunk ; her lips moved audibly , and murmured as she went , “
158061	158062	158105	158105	they	3829	” “
158074	158097	158065	158066	some one	1435	” thought the peasant , shouldering his axe as he went down into the little wood to cut ash‐sticks for the market . “
158112	158210	158105	158105	they	3829	” The old man guessed aright . She had received her mortal wound ; though it was one bloodless and tearless , and for which no moan was made , lest any should blame the slayer . The sense of some great guilt was on her , as she stole through the rosy warmth of the early morning . She had thought to take him liberty , honour , strength , and dominion among his fellows — and he had told her , that she had dealt him the foulest shame that his life had ever known . “
158222	158601	158214	158214	you	3831	” he had cried out against her in the bitterness of his soul . And she knew that , unasked , she had laid on him the debt of life . If ever he should know ? — She had wandered on and on , aimlessly , not knowing what she did all the night through , hearing no other sound but the fierce hard scathing scorn of his reproaches . He had told her she was in act so criminal , and yet she knew herself in intent so blameless ; she felt like those of whom she had heard in the old Hellenic stories , who had been doomed by fate , guiltless themselves , to work some direful guilt , which had to be , out to its bitter end , the innocent yet the accursed instrument of destiny , even as Adrastus upon Atys . On and on , through the moonlight she had fled , when she had left the water‐tower that night ; down the slope of the fields , through the late blossoms of the poppies , and the feathery haze of the ripened grasses tossed in waves from right to left ; the long shadows of the clouds upon the earth , chasing her like the spectre hosts of the Aaskarreya of his Scandinavian skies . She had dropped at last like a dying thing , broken and breathless on the ground . There she crouched , and hid her face upon her hands ; the scorch of an intolerable shame burned on it . She did not know what ailed her ; what consumed her with abhorrence of herself . She longed for the earth to yawn and cover her ; for the lilies asleep in the pool , to unclose and take her amidst them . Every shiver of a leaf , under a night‐bird ’s passage , every motion of the water , as the willow branches swept it , made her start and shiver as though some great guilt was on her soul . Not a breath of wind was stirring , not a sound disturbed the serenity of the early night ; she heard no voice but the plaintive cry of the cushat . She saw “
158609	159026	159027	159027	You	3832	” which looked on her cold and luminous , and indifferent to human woes as the eyes of Arslàn . Yet she was afraid ; afraid with a trembling horror of herself ; she who had once never known one pulse of fear , and who had smiled in the eyes of death as children in their mother ’s . The thrill of a new‐born , inexplicable , cruel consciousness stole like fire through her . She knew now that she loved him with that strange mystery of human love which had been for ever to her until now a thing apart from her , denied to her , half scorned , half yearned for ; viewed from afar with derision , yet with desire , as a thing at once beneath her and beyond her . All the light died ; the moon rose ; the while lilies shared in its pallid rays ; the night birds went by on the wind . She never stirred ; the passionate warmth of her frame changed to a deadly cold ; her face was buried in her hands ; ever and again she shivered , and glanced round , as the sound of a hare ’s step or the rustle of a bough by a squirrel broke the silence . The calm night‐world around her , the silvery seas of reeds , the dusky woods , the moon in its ring of golden vapour , the flickering foilage , the gleam of the glowworm in the dew , all the familiar things amidst which her feet had wandered for twelve summers in the daily measure of those beaten tracks ; all these seemed suddenly strange to her — mysterious , unreal . She longed for the day to dawn again , though day was but an hour dead . And yet she felt that at the first break of light she must flee and hide from his and every eye . She but meant to give him honour ; and he had upbraided her gift as shame . The bitterness , the cruelty , the passion of his reproaches , stung with their poison , as , in her vision of the reed , she had seen the barbed tongues of a thousand snakes striking through and through the frail , despised , blossomless slave of the wind . She had thought that as the god to the reed , so might he to her say hereafter , “
159053	159253	159255	159255	thee	3834	arisen,”—and for the insanity of her thought he had cursed her . Towards dawn , where she had sunk down in the moss , and in the thickets of elder and thorn — where she had made her bed in her childhood many a summer night , when she had been turned out from the doors of the mill‐house ; there for a little while a fitful exhausted sleep came to her ; the intense exhaustion of bodily fatigue overcoming and drugging to slumber the fever and the wakefulness of the mind . The thrush came out of the thorn , while it was still quite dark , and the morning stars throbbed in the skies , and sang his day‐song close about her head . In her sleep she smiled . For Oneiros was merciful ; and she dreamed that she slept folded close in the arms of Arslàn , and in her dreams she felt the kisses of his lips rain fast on hers . Then the old peasant trudging to his labour in the obscurity of the early day saw her , and struck at her with his foot and woke her roughly , and muttered , “
159273	159470	159471	159471	I	0	” She opened her eyes , and smiled on him unconsciously , as she had smiled in her brief oblivion . The passion of her dreams was still about her ; her mouth burned , her limbs trembled ; the air seemed to her filled with music , like the sound of the mavis singing in the thorn . Then she remembered ; and shuddered ; and arose , knowing the sweet , mad dream , which had cheated her , a lie . For she awoke alone . She did not heed the old man ’s words , she did not feel his hurt ; yet she obeyed him , and left the place , and dragged herself feebly towards Yprès by the sheer unconscious working of that instinct born of habit which takes the ox or the ass back undriven through the old accustomed ways to stand beside their ploughshare or their harness faithful and unbidden . Where the stream ran by the old mill‐steps the river reeds were blowing in the wind , with sun‐rays playing in their midst , and the silver wings of the swallows brushing them with a swift caress . “
159482	159490	159471	159471	I	0	” she said bitterly in her heart , “
159501	159862	159471	159471	I	0	” For she would have asked of fate no nobler thing than this — to be cut down as the reed by the reaper , if so be that through her the world might be brought to hearken to the music of the lips that she loved . She drew her aching weary limbs feebly through the leafy ways of the old mill‐garden . The first leaves of autumn fluttered down upon her head ; the last scarlet of the roses flashed in her path as she went ; the winelike odours of the fruits were all about her on the air . It was then fully day . The sun was up ; the bells rang the sixth hour far away from the high towers and spires of the town . At the mill‐house , and in the mill‐yard , where usually everyone had arisen and were hard at labour whist the dawn was dark , everything was still . There was no sign of work . The light blazed on the panes of the casements under the eaves , but its summons failed to arouse the sleepers under the roof . The bees hummed around their houses of straw ; the pigeons flew to and fro between the timbers of the walls and the boughs of the fruit trees . The mule leaned his head over the bar of the gate , and watched with wistful eyes . The cow in her shed lowed , impatient for some human hands to unbar her door , and lead her forth to her green clovered pasture . A dumb boy , who aided in the working of the mill , sat astride of a log of timber , kicking his feet amongst the long grasses , and blowing thistles down above his head upon the breeze . The silence and the inactivity startled her into a sense of them , as no noise or movement , curses of blows , could have done . She looked around stupidly ; the window‐shutters of the house‐windows were closed , as though it were still night . She signed rapidly to the boy . “
159877	159899	159900	159900	Flamma	117	” The lad left off blowing the thistle feathers on the wind , and grinned , and answered on his hands : “
159908	160220	159905	159905	they	3837	” And he grinned again , and laughed , as far as his uncouth and guttural noises could be said to approach the triumph and the jubilance of laughter . She stared at him blankly for awhile , bewildered and shaken from the stupor of her own misery . She had never thought of death and her tyrant in unison . He had seemed a man formed to live on and on and on unchanging for generations ; he was so hard , so unyielding , so hale , so silent , so callous to all pain ; it had ever seemed to her — and to the country round,—that death itself would never venture to come to wrestle with him . She stood amongst the red and the purple and the russet gold of the latest summer flowers in the mill‐garden , where he had scourged her as a little child for daring to pause and cool her burning face in the sweetness of the white lilies . Could that ruthless arm be unnerved even by age or death — it seemed to her quite impossible . All was quite still . Nothing stirred , except the silvery gnats of the morning , and the bees , and the birds in the leaves . There seemed a strange silence everywhere , and the great wheels stood still in the mill‐water ; never within the memory of any in that countryside had those wheels failed to turn at sunrise , unless locked by a winter‐frost . She hastened her steps , and went within . The clock ticked , the lean cat mewed ; other sound there was none . She left her wooden shoes at the bottom step , and stole up the steep stairs . The woman Pitchou peered with a scared face out from her master ’s chamber . “
160227	160235	160236	160237	thy grandsire	3839	” she whispered in her grating voice ; “
160241	160242	160236	160237	thy grandsire	3839	” “
160245	160246	160236	160237	thy grandsire	3839	” “
160249	160255	160256	160256	He	3839	” muttered the old peasant . “
160289	160290	160285	160285	You	3844	” “
160293	160416	160285	160285	You	3844	” muttered the girl fiercely ; and she dropt down on the topmost step , and rested her head on her hands . She had nothing to grieve for ; and yet there was that in the coarse congratulations which jarred on her and hurt her . She thought on Manon Dax dead in the snow ; she thought of the song‐birds dead in the traps ; she thought of the poor coming — coming — coming — through so many winters to beg bread , and going away with empty hands and burdened hearts , cursing God . Was this death‐bed all their vengeance ? It was poor justice , and came late . Old Pitchou stood and looked at her . “
160426	160630	160631	160631	She	3845	” she questioned in herself ; musing whether or no it were better to be civil to the one who might inherit all his wealth , or might be cast adrift upon the world — who could say which ? After awhile Folle‐Farine rose silently and brushed her aside , and went into the room . It was a poor chamber ; with a bed of straw and a rough bench or two , and a wooden cross with a picture of the Ascension hung above it . The square window was open , a knot of golden pear leaves nodded to and fro ; a linnet sang . On the bed Claudis Flamma lay ; dead already , except for the twitching of his mouth , and the restless wanderings of his eyes . Yet not so lost to life but that he knew her at a glance ; and , as she entered , glared upon her , and clenched his numbed hands upon the straw , and with a horrible effort in his almost lifeless limbs , raised the right arm , that alone had any strength or warmth left in it , and pointed at her with a shriek : “
160659	160707	160708	160708	You	0	” Then with a ghastly rattle in his throat , he quivered , and lay paralysed again ; only the eyes were alive , and were still speaking — awfully . Folle‐Farine went up to his bed , and stood beside it , looking down on him . “
160714	160803	160708	160708	You	0	” It was the first time that she had ever said the word . Her voice lingered on the word , as though loth to leave its unfamiliar sweetness . He lay and looked at her , motionless , impatient , lifeless ; save only for the bleak and bloodshot stare of the stony eyes . She thought that he had heard ; but he made no sign in answer . She sank down on her knees beside his bed , and put her lips close to him . “
160817	160885	160810	160811	my mother	1264	” she murmured , with a pathetic longing in her voice . A shudder shook his frozen limbs . He made no answer , he only glared on her with a terrible stare that might be horror , repentance , grief , memory , fear — she could not tell . Old Pitchou stretched her head from the corner , as a hooded snake from its hole . “
160893	160901	160810	160811	my mother	1264	” she hissed in a shrill whisper . “
160912	160934	160810	160811	my mother	1264	” He understood , for a smile grim and horrible disturbed his tight lips a moment . Folle‐Farine did not hear . “
160945	161204	160940	160940	me	0	” she muttered . Since a human love had been born in her heart , she had thought often of that mother whose eyes had never looked on her , and whose arms had never held her . His face changed , but he did not speak ; he gasped for breath , and lay silent ; his eyes troubled and confused ; it might be that in that moment remorse was with him , and there arose the vain regrets of cruel years . It might be that dying thus , he knew that from his hearth , as from hell , mother and child had both been driven whilst his lips had talked of God . A little bell rang softly in the orchard below the casement ; the clear voice of a young boy singing a canticle crossed the voice of the linnet ; there was a gleam of silver in the sun . The Church bore its Host to the dying man . They turned her from the chamber . The eyes of one unsanctified might not gaze upon the mysteries of the blest . She went out without resistance ; she was oppressed and stupefied ; she went to the stairs , and there sat down again , resting her forehead on her hands . The door of the chamber was a little open , and she could hear the murmurs of the priest ’s words , and smell the odours of the sacred chrism . A great bitterness came on her mouth . “
161230	161261	161262	161262	God	118	” she thought . And she could see nothing but the old famished face of Manon Dax in the snow and the moonlight , as the old woman had muttered , “
161266	161298	161299	161299	I	0	” The offices of the Church ceased ; there reigned an intense stillness ; a stillness as of cold . Suddenly the voice of Claudis Flamma rang out loud and shrill . “
161309	161414	161415	161415	he	3855	” She rose and looked through the space of the open door into the death‐chamber . He had sprung half erect , and with his arms outstretched , gazed at the gladness and the brightness of the day . In his eyes there was a mortal agony , a passion of reproach . With one last supreme effort , he raised the crucifix which the priests had laid upon his bare anointed breast , and held it aloft , and shook it , and spat on it , and cast it forth from him broken on the ground . Even Thou art a lie ! ”
161803	161815	161766	161766	man	4882	“ O Lord , I believe , help thou mine unbelief ! ”
162016	162027	162028	162028	she	3874	“ It is so cruel ! It is so cruel ! ”
162282	162293	162271	162272	one another	700	“ Hast heard ? Flamma is dead — at last . ”
162466	162472	162473	162477	the shrewd old Norman crone	3899	“ For who can tell ? ”
162482	162530	162473	162477	the shrewd old Norman crone	3899	“ who can tell ? She may get all the treasure : who knows ? And if so , it will be best to have been a little good to her this day , and to seem as if one had forgiven about the chain of coins . ”
162555	162569	162570	162572	the old peasant	638	“ Whom will he have left all the wealth to , think you , ”
162601	162608	162580	162580	her	638	“ The wealth , whose wealth ? ”
162672	162678	162680	162681	the woman	633	“ Aye , his wealth , ”
162731	162895	162990	162991	the woman	633	“ Aye , his wealth . You , who look so sharp after your bits of heathen coins , can not for sure pretend to forget the value he must have laid by , living as he lived all the days from his youth upward . There must be a rare mass of gold hid away somewhere or another — the notary knows , I suppose — it is all in the place , that I am sure . He was too wise ever to trust money far from home ; he knew well it was a gad‐about , that once you part with never comes back to you . It must be all in the secret places ; in the thatch , under the hearthstone , in the rafters , under the bricks . And , maybe , there will be quite a fortune . He made so much , and he lived so near . Where think you it will go ? ”
162908	162933	162990	162991	the woman	633	“ It should go to the poor . It belongs to them . It was all coined out of their hearts and their bodies . ”
162934	162943	162990	162991	the woman	633	“ They you have no hope for yourself:—you ? ”
162944	162947	162948	162948	She	3908	“ I ? ”
162977	162988	162990	162991	the woman	633	“ Pshaw ! You can not cheat me that way , ”
163003	163078	163079	163079	She	3908	“ As if a thing of hell like you ever served like a slave all these years , on any other hope , than the hope of the gold ! Well,—as for me , I never pretend to lie in that fashion . If it had not been for the hope of a share in the gold , I would never have eaten for seventeen years the old wretch ’s mouldy crusts and lentil‐washings . ”
163237	163281	163234	163234	her	3908	“ Take , enjoy , be free do as you will . So that you make the world of men own your greatness , I will live as a beggar all the years of my life , and think myself richer than kings ! ”
163321	163330	163312	163312	she	3908	“ All that is mine , is thine . ”
163359	163370	163355	163355	he	3918	“ You have no right to burden me with debt . ”
163648	163653	163654	163655	the Norman	3926	“ Who can say ? ”
163660	163675	163654	163655	the Norman	3926	“ Who can say ? She may yet get it all , who knows ? ”
163694	163705	163706	163706	she	3908	“ If only I could know who gets the gold ? ”
164189	164203	164186	164186	she	3908	“ If only I might die for him;—as the reed for the god ! ”
164326	164362	164363	164363	She	3908	“ Folle‐Farine,—I go on your errand . If you repent there is time yet to stay me . Say — do you bid me still set your Norse‐god free from the Cave of the Snakes ? ”
164420	164431	164432	164434	the old man	335	“ What did he say to you for your gold ? ”
164478	164518	164472	164472	He	335	“ Ah ! You fancied I did not know your design when you came so bravely to sell your Moorish dancing‐gear . Oh , Folle‐Farine!—female things , with eyes like yours , must never hope to keep a secret ? ”
164564	164572	164574	164575	her questioner	3965	“ What did he say to you ? ”
164577	164597	164574	164575	her questioner	3965	“ There should be but one language possible from a man of his years to a woman of yours . ”
164607	164628	164600	164600	her	3908	“ He said that I did him a foul shame : the gold lies in the sands of the river . ”
164702	164716	164717	164717	She	3908	“ He would not take your poor little pieces ? You mean that ? ”
164724	164735	164717	164717	She	3908	“ That was a poor reward to you , Folle‐Farine ! ”
164744	164750	164751	164751	she	3908	“ Mine was the fault , ”
164752	164762	164679	164693	The old man , leaning on the wooden bar of the gate amongst the leaves	3967	muttered—“the folly . He was right , no doubt . ”
164763	164789	164797	164797	her	3908	“ You are very loyal . I think your Northern god was only thus cold because your gift was such a little one , Folle‐Farine . ”
164800	164815	164797	164797	her	3908	“ It would have been the same if I had offered him an empire . ”
164816	164833	164834	164834	She	3908	“ You are so sure ? Does he hate you then — this god of yours ? ”
164855	164866	164867	164867	she	3908	“ Need a man hate the dust under his foot ? ”
164873	164890	164867	164867	she	3908	“ Because it is a thing too lowly for him to think of as he walks . ”
164891	164897	164898	164898	She	3908	“ You are very truthful . ”
165019	165025	165026	165026	he	335	“ All these in Paris , ”
165030	165127	165026	165026	he	335	“ Just as she is , with just the same bare feet and limbs , the same untrammelled gait , the same flash of scarlet round her loins , only to the linen tunic a hem of gold , and on the breast a flame of opals . Paris would say that even I had never in my many years done better . The poor barbarian ! she sells her little brazen sequins , and thinks them her only treasure , whilst she has all that ! Is Arslàn blind , or is he only tired ? ”
165165	165168	165169	165169	he	335	“ Well , ”
165174	165221	165169	165169	he	335	“ I understand ; your eagle , in recompense for your endeavours to set him free , only tears your heart with his talons ? It is the way of eagles . He has wounded you sorely . And the wound will bleed many a day . ”
165227	165241	165222	165222	She	3974	“ Have I complained?—have I asked your pity , or any man ’s ? ”
165242	165275	165169	165169	he	335	“ Oh , no , you are very strong ! So is a lioness ; but she dies of a man ’s wound sometimes . He has been very base to you . ”
165276	165297	165169	165169	he	335	“ He has done as he thought it right to do . Who shall lay blame on him for that ? ”
165298	165332	165222	165222	She	3974	“ Your loyalty says so ; you are very brave , no doubt . But tell me , do you still wish this man , who wounds you so cruelly , set free ? ”
165333	165336	165169	165169	he	335	“ Yes . ”
165337	165342	165169	165169	he	335	“ What , still ? ”
165343	165347	165169	165169	he	335	“ Why not ? ”
165348	165389	165169	165169	he	335	“ Why not ? Only this : that once he is let loose your very memory will be shaken from his thoughts as the dust of the summer , to which you liken yourself , is shaken from his feet ! ”
165390	165394	165395	165395	She	3975	“ No doubt . ”
165444	165448	165449	165449	he	3976	“ No doubt , ”
165452	165724	165449	165449	he	3976	“ And yet I think you hardly understand . This man is a great artist . He has a great destiny , if he once can gain the eye and the ear of the world . The world will fear him , and curse him always ; he is very merciless to it ; but if he once conquer fame , that fame will be one to last as long as the earth lasts . That I believe . Well , give this man what he longs for and strives for , a life in his fame which shall not die so long as men have breath to speak of art . What will you be in that great drunken dream of his , if once we make it true for him ? Not even a remembrance , Folle‐Farine . For though you have fancied that you , by your beauty , would at least abide upon his canvas , and so go on to immortality with his words and name , you seem not to know that so much also will do any mime who lets herself for hire on a tavern stage , or any starveling who makes her daily bread by giving her face and form to a painter ’s gaze . Child ! what you have thought noble , men and women have decreed one of the vilest means by which a creature traffics in her charms . The first lithe‐limbed model that he finds in the cities will displace you on his canvas and in his memory . Shall he go free — to forget you ? ”
165756	165766	165729	165729	her	3978	“ He shall be free — to forget me . ”
165849	166200	166201	166201	His	3983	“ Well ; be it so if you will it . Only think long enough . For strong though you are , you are also weak ; for you are of your mother ’s sex , Folle‐Farine . You may repent . Think well . You are no more to him than your eponymus , the mill‐dust . You have said so to yourself . But you are beautiful in your barbarism ; and here you are always near him ; and with a man who has no gold to give , a woman need have few rivals to fear . If his heart eat itself out here in solitude , soon or late , he will be yours , Folle‐Farine . A man , be he what he will , can not live long without some love , more or less , for some woman . A little while , and your Norse‐god alone here , disappointed , embittered , friendless , galled by poverty , and powerless to escape , will turn to you , and find a sweetness on your lips , a balm in your embrace , an opium draught for an hour , at least , in that wonderful beauty of yours . A woman who is beautiful , and who has youth , and who has passion , need never fail to make a love‐light beam in the eyes of a man , if only she know how to wait , if only she be the sole blossom that grows in his pathway , the sole fruit within the reach of his hands . Keep him here , and soon or late , out of sheer despair of any other paradise , he will make his paradise in your breast . Do you doubt ? Child , I have known the world many years , but this one thing I have ever known to be stronger than any strength a man can bring against it to withstand it — this one thing which fate has given you , the bodily beauty of a woman . ”
166423	166432	166433	166433	He	3983	“ I have lived : it is enough ! ”
166685	166688	166699	166699	his	4882	“ Choose , ”
166708	166748	166699	166699	his	4882	“ Shall he consume his heart here in solitude till he loves you perforce , or shall he go free amongst the cities of men , to remember you no more than he remembers the reeds by the river ? ”
166896	166905	166906	166906	she	3984	“ What have you to do with me ? ”
166926	166945	166906	166906	she	3984	“ Keep your word ; set him free . His freedom let him use — as he will . ”
167031	167069	167070	167070	he	221	“ The Red Mouse does not dwell in that soul as yet . That sublime unreason — that grand barbaric madness ! And yet both will fall to gold , as that fruit falls to the touch , ”
167334	167345	167322	167322	she	4009	“ Will he forget?—forget quite — when he is free ? ”
167535	167541	167543	167545	the old serving‐woman	3898	“ She has been told , ”
167547	167561	167543	167545	the old serving‐woman	3898	“ She has been told , and her heart breaks for the gold . ”
167576	167580	167581	167581	she	4009	“ Come within , ”
167592	167646	167581	167581	she	4009	“ I will give thee a crust and a drink of milk . None shall say I can not act like a Christian ; and tonight I will let thee rest here in the loft , but no longer . With the break of day thou shalt tramp . We are Christians here . ”
167661	167666	167667	167667	she	4009	“ You called me ? ”
167685	167782	167667	167667	she	4009	“ Ay , I called . I would have thee to know that I am mistress here now ; and I will have no vile things gad about in the night so long as they eat of my bread . To‐night thou shalt rest here , I say ; so much will I do for sake of thy mother , though she was a foul light o’love ; when all men deemed her a saint ; but to‐morrow thou shalt tramp . Such hell‐spawn as thou art may not lie on a bed of holy church . ”
167823	167827	167828	167828	she	104	“ You mean , ”
167831	167846	167828	167828	she	104	“ you mean — What would you tell me ? I do not know . ”
167889	167905	167931	167931	Pitchou	147	“ You prate of the soul . I alone am the soul of the world . ”
167970	167982	167983	167985	The old woman	334	thought—“Will he forget — forget quite — when he is free ? ”
168001	168118	167987	167987	her	334	“ Hast thou not heard ? No ? Well , see then . Some said you should be sent for , but the priest and I said No . Neither Law nor Church count the love‐begotten . Flamma died worth forty thousand francs , set aside all his land and household things . God rest his soul ! He was a man . He forgot my faithful service , true , but the good almoner will remember all that to me . Forty thousand francs ! What a man ! And hardly a nettled boiled in oil would he eat some days together . Where does this money go — eh , eh ? Canst guess ? ”
168119	168122	168123	168123	Pitchou	147	“ Go ? ”
168132	168381	168123	168123	Pitchou	147	“ Ah , ah ! I know . So you dared to hope too ? Oh fool ! What thing did ever he hate as he hated your shadow on the wall ? The money , and the lands , and the things — every coin , every inch , every crumb — is willed away to the Bishop , to the holy Bishop in the town yonder , to hold for the will of God and the glory of his kingdom . And masses will be said for his soul , daily , in the cathedral ; and the gracious almoner has as good as said that the mill shall be let to Fraçvron , the baker , who is old and has no women to his house ; and that I shall dwell here and manage all things , and rule Fraçvron , and end my days in the chimney corner . And I will stretch a point and let you lie in the hay to‐night , but to‐morrow you must tramp , for the devil ’s daughter and Holy Church will scarce go to roost together . Folle‐Farine heard her stupidly , and stupidly gazed around ; she did not understand . She had never had any other home , and , in a manner , even in the apathy of a far greater woe , she clove to this place ; to its familiarity , and its silences , and its old woodland ways . “
168382	168421	168123	168123	Pitchou	147	Go!”—she looked down through the aisles of the boughs dreamily ; in a vague sense she felt the sharpness of desolation which repulses the creature whom no human heart desires , and whom no human voice bids stay . “
168430	168440	168441	168441	I	0	” said the peasant , with a sardonic grin . “
168513	168623	169805	169805	they	4032	” Folle‐Farine , without a word in answer , turned on her heel and left her . The old woman watched her shadow pass across the threshold , and away down the garden paths between the green lines of the clipped box , and vanish beyond the fall of drooping fig boughs and the walls of ivy and of laurel ; then with a chuckle she poured out her hot coffee , and sat in her corner and made her evening meal well pleased ; comfort was secured her for the few years which she had to live , and she was revenged for the loss of the sequins . “
168640	169610	168631	168631	I	0	” she thought , foreseeing easy years and plenty under the rule of the Church and of old deaf Françvron the baker . Folle‐Farine mounted the wooden ladder to the hayloft which had been her sleeping‐chamber , there took the little linen and the few other garments which belonged to her , folded them together in her winter sheep‐skin , and sent down the wooden steps once more , and out of the mill‐garden across the bridge into the woods . She had no fixed purpose even for the immediate hour ; she had not even a tangible thought for her future . She acted on sheer mechanical impulse , like one who does sane things unconsciously , walking abroad in the trance of sleep . That she was absolutely destitute scarcely bore any sense to her . She had never realised that this begrudged roof and scanty fare , which Flamma had bestowed on her , had , wretched though they were , yet been all the difference between home and homelessness — between existence and starvation . She wandered on aimlessly through the woods . She paused a moment on the river ’s edge , and turned and looked back at the mill and the house . Form where she stood , she could see its brown gables and its peaked roof rising from masses of orchard foilage , and green garden leaves ; further round it , closed the dark belt of the deep chestnut woods . She looked ; and great salt tears rushed into her hot eyes and blinded them . She had been hated by those who dwelt there , and had there known only pain , and toil , and blows , and bitter words . And yet the place itself was dear to her ; its homely and simple look , its quiet garden ways , its dells of leafy shadow , its bright and angry waters , its furred and feathered creatures that gave it life and loveliness,—these had been her consolations often,—these , in a way , she loved . Such as it was , her life had been bound up with it ; and though often its cool pale skies and level lands had been a prison to her , yet her heart clove to it in this moment when she left it — for ever . She looked once at it long and lingeringly , full in the light of the rising sun ; then turned and went on her way . She walked slowly through the cool evening shadows , while the birds fluttered about her head . She did not comprehend the terrible fate that had befallen her . She did not think that it was horrible to have no canopy but the clear sky , and no food but the grain rubbed form the ripe wheat‐ears . The fever of conscious passion which had been born in her , and the awe of the lonely death that she had witnessed , were on her too heavily , and with too dreamy and delirious an absorption , to leave any room in her thoughts for the bodily perils or the bodily privations of her fate . Some vague expectancy of some great horror , she knew not what , was on her . She was as in a trance , her brain was giddy , her eyes blind . Though she walked straightly , bearing her load upon her head , on and on as through the familiar paths , she yet had no goal , no sense of what she meant to do , or whither she desired to go . The people were still about , going from their work in the fields , and their day at the town‐market , to their homesteads and huts . Every one of them cast some word at her . For the news had spread by sunset over all the country‐side that Flamma ’s treasures were gone to holy Church . They were spoken in idleness , but they were sharp , flouting , merciless arrows of speech , that struck her hardly as the speakers cast them , and laughed , and passed by her . She gave no sign that she heard , not by so much as the quiver of a muscle or the glance of an eye ; but she , nevertheless , was stung by them to the core . For they showed her how worthless and friendless a thing had dared to dream that she might be of service to the life of Arslàn . Not one of them , man or boy , but made a mock of her as they trooped by through the purpling leaves or the tall seed‐grasses . Not one of them , mother or maiden , that gave a gentle look at her , paused to remember that she was homeless , and knew no more where to lay her head that night than any sick hart driven from its kind . She met many in the soft grey and golden evening , in the fruit‐hung ways , along the edge of the meadows ; fathers with their little children running by them , laden with plumes of night‐shade ; mothers bearing their youngest born before them on the high sheepskin saddle ; young lovers talking together as they drove the old cow to her byre ; old people counting their market gains cheerily ; children paddling knee‐deep in the brooks for cresses . None of them had a kindly glance for her;—all had a flouting word . There was not one who offered her so much as a draught of milk ; not one who wished her so much as a brief good‐night . “
169624	169785	169611	169611	She	4029	” she heard many of them say of her . And they spoke of Flamma , and praised him ; saying , how pure as myrrh in the nostrils was the death of one who feared God . The night came on nearer ; the ways grew more lonely ; the calf bleating sought its dam , the sheep folded down close together , the lights came out under the lowly roofs ; now and then from some open window in the distance there came the sound of voices singing together ; now and then there fell across her path two shadows turning one to the other . She only was alone . What did she seek to do ? She paused on a little slip of moss‐green timber that crossed the water in the open plain , and looked down at herself in the shining stream . None desired her — none remembered her ; none said to her , “
169797	169798	169611	169611	She	4029	” “
169814	169963	169805	169805	they	4032	” she thought ; and she pondered wearily in her heart where her sin against them could lie . That brief delirious trance of joy that had come to her with the setting of the last day ’s sun , had with the sun sunk away . The visions which had haunted her sleep under the thorn‐tree whilst the thrush sang , had been killed under the cold and bitterness of the waking world . She wondered , while her face grew red with shame , what she had been mad enough to dream of in that sweet , cruel slumber . For him — she felt that sooner than again look upward to his eyes she would die by a thousand deaths . What was she to him?—a barbarous , worthless , and unlovely thing , whose very service was despised , whose very sacrifice was condemned . “
169991	170515	170518	170518	she	4035	” she thought ; and she was unconscious of horror or of impiety in the ghastly desire , because she ahd but one religion , this — her love . She crossed the little bridge , and sat down to rest on the root of an old oak on the edge of the fields of poppies . The evening had fallen quite . There was a bright moon on the edge of the plain . The cresset lights of the cathedral glowed through the dusk . All was purple and grey and still . There were the scents of heavy earths and wild thymes and the breath of grazing herds . The little hamlets were but patches of darker shade on the soft brown shadows of the night . White sea‐mists , curling and rising chased each other over the dim world . She sat motionless , leaning her head upon her hand . She could not weep , as other creatures could . The hours drew on . She had no home to go to ; but it was not for this that she sorrowed . Afar off , a step trod down the grasses . A hawk rustled through the gloom . A rabbit fled across the path . The boughs were put aside by a human hand ; Arslàn came out from the darkness of the woods before her . With a sharp cry she sprang to her feet and fled , on one passionate reasonless instinct to hide herself for ever and for ever from the only eyes she loved . Before her was the maze of the poppy‐fields . In the moonlight their blossom , so gorgeous at sunset or at noon , lost all their scarlet gaud and purple pomp , and drooped like discrowned kings stripped bare in the midnight of calamity . Their colourless flowers writhed and twined about her ankles . Her brown limbs glistened in the gleam from the skies . She tightened her red girdle round her loins and ran , as a doe runs to reach the sanctuary . Long withes of trailing grasses , weeds that grew amongst the grasses , caught her fleet feet and stopped her . The earth was wet with dew . A tangle of boughs and brambles filled the path . For once , her sure steps failed her . She faltered and fell . Ere he could touch her , she rose again . The scent of the wet leaves was in her hair . The rain‐drops glistened on her feet . The light of the stars seemed in her burning eyes . Around her were the gleam of the night , the scent of the flowers , the smell of the woods . On her face the moon shone . She was like a creature born from the freshness of dews , from the odour of foilage , from the hues of the clouds , from the foam of the brooks , from all things of the woods and the water . In that moment she was beautiful with the beauty of women . “
170523	170727	170518	170518	she	4035	” he thought . If only he cared for the song of the reed by the river ! But he cared nothing at all for anything that lived ; and a pursuit that was passionless of a thing that was helpless , seemed to him base ; and his feet were set on a stony and narrow road where he would not encumber his strength with a thing of her sex , lest the burden should draw him backward one rood on his way . He had never loved her ; he never would love her ; his eyes were awake to her beauty , indeed , and his reason owned it beyond all usual gifts of her sex . But his senses remained cold to it : he had used it in the service of his art , and therein had scrutinised , and pourtrayed , and debased it , until it had lost to him all that fanciful sanctity , all that half‐mysterious charm , which arouse the passion of love in a man to a woman . So he let her be , and stood by her in the dusk of the night with no light in his own eyes . “
170734	170740	170518	170518	she	4035	” he said to her . “
170753	170817	170818	170818	I	0	” She stood silent , her head bent ; her hands were crossed upon her chest in the posture habitual to her under any pain ; her face was shrouded in the shadow ; her little bundles of clothes had dropped on the grasses , and was hidden by them . Of Flamma ’s death and of her homelessness he had heard nothing . “
170824	170830	170831	170831	I	0	” he said , gently . “
170861	170862	170858	170858	you	4036	” “
170868	170872	170866	170866	mine	4037	” she muttered . “
170880	170937	170875	170875	I	0	” Her voice was very faint , and left her lips with effort ; she did not look up ; she stood bloodless , breathless , swaying to and fro , as a young tree which has been cut through near the root sways ere it falls . She knew well what his words would say . “
170951	171036	170943	170943	you	4036	” he said with a certain softness as of unwilling pain in his voice which shook its coldness and serenity . This greatness in her , this wondrous faithfulness to himself , this silence , which bore all wounds from his hand , and was never broken to utter one reproach against him , these moved him . He could not choose but see that this nature , which he bruised and forsook , was noble beyond any common nobility of any human thing . “
171052	171057	171046	171046	you	4036	” he said slowly . “
171075	171329	171066	171066	I	0	” She had awaited her death‐blow ; she received its stroke without a sound . She did not move , nor cry out , nor make any sign of pain , but standing there her form curled within itself , as a withered fern curls , and all her beauty changed like a fresh flower that is held in a flame . She did not look at him ; but waited , with her head bent , and her hands crossed on her breast as a criminal waits for his doom . His nerve nearly failed him ; his heart nearly yielded . He had no love for her ; she was nothing to him . No more than any one of the dark , nude , savage women who had sat to this art on the broken steps of ruined Temples of the Sun ; or the antelope‐eyed creature of desert and plain who had come before him in the light of the East , and had passed as the shadows passed , and , like them , were forgotten . She was nothing to him . And yet he could not choose but think — all this mighty love , all this majestic strength , all this superb and dreamy loveliness , would die out here , as the evening colours had died out of the skies in the west , none pausing even to note that they were dead . He knew that he had but to say to her , “
171332	171523	171066	171066	I	0	” and she would go beside him , whether to shame or ignominy , or famine or death , triumphant and rejoicing as the martyrs of old went to the flames , which were to them the gates of paradise . He knew that there would not be a blow his hand could deal which could make her deem him cruel ; he knew that there would be no crime which he could bid her commit for him which would not seem to her a virtue ; he knew that for one hour of his love she would slay herself by any death he told her ; he knew that the deepest wretchedness lived through by his side would be sweeter and more glorious than any kingdom of the world or heaven . And he knew well that to no man is it given to be loved twice with such love as this . Yet,—he loved not her ; and he was , therefore , strong , and he drove the death‐stroke home , with pity , with compassion , with gentleness , yet surely home — to the heart . “
171535	171560	171524	171525	A stranger	5005	” he said to her ; and it seemed even to him as though he slew a life godlier and purer and stronger than his own,—“an
171702	171786	171787	171787	I	0	” She was silent ; her attitude had not changed , but all her loveliness was like one of the poppies that his foot had trodden on , discoloured , broken , ruined . She stood as though changed to a statue of bronze . He looked on her , and knew that no creature had ever loved him as this creature had loved . But of love he wanted nothing,—it was weariness to him ; all he desired was power amongst men . “
171794	171800	171787	171787	I	0	” he said , suddenly . “
171839	171840	171832	171832	you	4041	” “
171848	172011	171841	171841	You	0	” she made answer to him . She did not stir ; nor did the deadly calm on her face change ; but her voice had a harsh metallic sound , like the jar of a bell that is broken . He was silent also . The coldness and the arrogance of his heart were pained and humbled by her pardon of them . He knew that he had been pitiless to her — with a pitilessness less excusable than that which is born of the fierceness of passion and the idolatrous desires of the senses . Man would have held him blameless here , because he had forborn to pluck for his own this red and gold reed in the swamp ; but he himself knew well that , nevertheless , he had trodden its life out , and so bruised it , as he went , that never would any wind of heaven breathe music through its shattered grace again . “
172017	172075	172014	172014	you	4046	” she asked . Her voice had still the same harsh broken sound in it . She did not lift the lids of her eyes ; her arms were crossed upon her breast;—all the ruins of the trampled poppy‐blossom were about her , blood‐red as a field where men have fought and died . He answered her , “
172079	172080	172014	172014	you	4046	” “
172084	172085	171841	171841	You	0	” “
172098	172254	172089	172089	I	0	” A long silence fell between them . The church chimes , far away in the darkness , tolled the ninth hour . She stood passive , colourless as the poppies were , bloodless from the thick , dull beating of her heart . The purple shadow and the white stars swam around her . Her heart was broken ; but she gave no sign . It was her nature to suffer to the last in silence . He looked at her , and his own heart softened ; almost he repented him . He stretched his arms to her , and drew her into them , and kissed the dew‐laden weight of her hair , and the curling lithe from , whence all warmth had died , and the passionate loveliness , which was cast to him , to be folded in his bosom or thrust away by his foot — as he chose . “
172266	172270	172257	172257	child	1265	” he murmured . “
172328	172550	172323	172323	I	0	” She burned like fire , and grew cold as ice in his embrace . Her brain reeled ; her sight was blind . She trembled as she had never done under the sharpest throes of Flamma ’s scourge . Suddenly she cast her arms about his throat , and clung to him , and kissed him in answer with that strange , mute , terrible passion with which the lips of the dying kiss the warm and living face that bends above them , on which they know they never again will rest . Then she broke from him , and sprang into the maze of the moonlit fields , and fled from him like a stag that bears its death‐shot in it , and knows it , and seeks to hide itself and die unseen . He pursued her , urged by a desire that was cruel , and a sorrow that was tender . He had no love for her ; and yet — now that he had thrown her from him for ever — he would fain have felt those hot mute lips tremble again in their terrible eloquence upon his own . But he sought her in vain . The shadows of the night hid her from him . He went back to his home alone . “
172556	172631	172323	172323	I	0	” he said to himself . For the life that lay before him he needed all his strength , all his coldness , all his cruelty . And she was only a frail female thing — a reed of the river , songless , and blown by the wind as the rest were . He returned to his solitude , and lit his lamp , and looked on the creations which alone he loved . “
172639	172679	172635	172635	I	0	” he said in his own heart . With the war to which he went what had any amorous toy to do ? That night Hermes had no voice for him . Else might the wise god had said , “
172739	175130	175132	175132	you	4055	” But Hermes that night spake not . And he brake his reed , and cast it behind him . WHEN the dawn came , it found her lying face downward among the rushes by the river . She had run on , and on , and on blindly , not knowing where she fled , with the strange force which despair lends ; then suddenly had dropped , as a young bull drops in the circus with the steel sheathed in its brain . There she had remained insensible , the blood flowing a little from her mouth . It was quite lonely by the waterside . A crane among the sedges , an owl on the wind , a water‐lizard under the stones , such were the only moving things . It was in a solitary bend of the stream ; its banks were green and quiet ; there were no dwellings near ; and there was no light anywhere , except the dull glow of the lamp above the Calvary . No one found her . A young fox came and smelt at her , and stole frightened away . That was all . A sharp wind rising with the reddening of the east blew on her , and recalled her to consciousness after many hours . When her eyes at length opened , with a blank stare upon the greyness of the shadows , she lifted herself a little and sat still , and wondered what had chanced to her . The first rays of the sun rose over the dim blue haze of the horizon . She looked at it and tried to remember , but failed . Her mind was sick and dull . A little beetle , green and bronze , climbed in and out amongst the sand of the river‐shore ; her eyes vacantly followed the insect ’s aimless circles . She tried to think , and could not ; her thoughts went feebly and madly round and round , round and round , as the beetle went in his maze of sand . It was all so grey , so still , so chill , she was afraid of it . Her limbs were stiffened by the exposure and dews of the night . She shivered and was cold . The sun rose — a globe of flame above the edge of the world . Memory flashed on her with its light . She rose a little , staggering and blind , and weakened by the loss of blood ; she crept feebly to the edge of the stream , and washed the stains from her lips , and let her face rest a little in the sweet , silent , flowing water . Then she sat still amidst the long rush‐like grass , and thought , and thought , and wondered why life was so tough and merciless a thing , that it would ache on , and burn on , and keep misery awake to know itself even when its death‐blow had been dealt , and the steel was in its side . She was still only half sensible of her wretchedness . She was numbed by weakness , and her brain seemed deadened by a hot pain , that shot through it as with tongues of flame . The little beetle at her feet was busied in a yellower soil than sand . He moved round and round in a little dazzling heap of coins , and trembling paper thin as gauze . She saw it without seeing for awhile ; then , all at once , a knowledge flashed on her . She saw that the money had fallen from her tunic . She guessed the truth — that in his last embrace he had slid into her bosom half that sum whereof he had spoken as the ransom which had set him free . Her bloodless face grew scarlet with an immeasurable shame . She would have suffered far less if he had killed her . He who denied her love to give her gold ! Better that , when he had kissed her , he had covered her eyes softly with one hand , and with the other driven his knife straight through the white warmth of her breast . The sight of the gold stung her like a snake . Gold!—such wage as men flung to the painted harlots gibing at the corners of the streets ! The horror of the humiliation filled her with loathing of herself . Unless she had become shameful in his sight , she thought , he could not have cast this shame upon her . She gathered herself slowly up , and stood and looked with blind aching eyes at the splendour of the sunrise . Her heart was breaking . Her one brief dream of gladness was severed sharply , as with a sword , and killed for ever . She did not reason — all thought was stunned with her ; but as a woman , who loves looking on the face she loves , will see sure death written there long ere any other can detect it , so she knew , by the fatal and unerring instinct of passion , that he was gone from her as utterly and as eternally as though his grave had closed on him . She did not even in her own heart reproach him . Her love for him was too perfect to make rebuke against him possible to her . Had he not a right to go as he would , to do as he chose , to take her or leave her , as best might seem to him ? Only he had no right to shame her with what he had deemed shame to himself ; no right to insult what he had slain . She gathered herself slowly up , and took his money in her hand , and went along the river bank . Whither ? She had no knowledge at first ; but , as she moved against the white light and the cool currents of the morning air , her brain cleared a little . The purpose which had risen in her slowly matured and strengthened ; without its sustenance she would have sunk down and perished , like a flower cut at the root . Of all the world that lay beyond the pale of those golden and russet orchards and scarlet lakes of blowing poppies she had no more knowledge than the lizard at her feet . Cities , he had often said , were as fiery furnaces that consumed all youth and innocence which touched them : for such as she to go to them was , he had often said , to cast a luscious and golden peach of the summer into the core of a wasp ’s nest . Nevertheless , her mind was resolute to follow him,—to follow him unknown by him ; so that , if his footsteps turned to brighter paths , her shadow might never fall across his ways ; but so that , if need were , if failure still pursued him , and by failure came misery and death , she would be there beside him , to share those fatal gifts which none would dispute with her or grudge . To follow him was to her an instinct as natural and as irresistible as it is to the dog to track his master ’s wanderings . She would have starved ere she would have told him that she hungered . She would have perished by the roadside ere ever she would have cried to him that she was homeless . She would have been torn asunder for a meal by wolves ere she would have bought safety or succour by one coin of that gold he had slid in her bosom , like the wages of a thing that was vile . But to follow him she never hesitated : unless this had been possible to her , she would have refused to live another hour . The love in her , at once savage and sublime , at once strong as the lion ’s rage and humble as the camel ’s endurance , made her take patiently all wrongs at his hands , but made her powerless to imagine a life in which he was not . She went slowly now through the country , in the hush of the waking day . He had said that he would leave at dawn . In her unconscious agony of the night gone by , she had run far and fast ere she had fallen ; and now , upon her waking , she had found herself some league from the old mill‐woods , and further yet from the tower on the river where he dwelt . She was weak , and the way seemed very long to her ; ever and again , too , she started aside and hid herself , thinking each step were his . She wanted to give him back his gold , yet she felt as though one look of his eyes would kill her . It was long , and the sun was high , ere she had dragged her stiff and feeble limbs through the long grasses of the shore and reached the ruined granary . Crouching down , and gazing through the spaces in the stones from which so often she had watched him , she saw at once that the place was desolate . The great Barabbas , and the painted panels and canvases , and all the pigments and tools and articles of an artist ’s store , were gone : but the figures on the walls were perforce left there to perish . The early light fell full upon them , sad and calm and pale , living their life upon the stone . She entered and looked at them . She loved them greatly ; it pierced her heart to leave them there — alone . The bound Helios working at the mill , with white Hermes watching , mute and content,—Persephone crouching in the awful shadow of the dread winged King,—the Greek youths , with doves in their breasts and golden apples in their hands,—the women dancing upon Cithæron , in the moonlight,—the young gladiator wrestling with the Libyan lion,—all the familiar shapes and stories that made the grey walls teem with the old sweet life of the heroic times , were there — left to the rat and the spider , the dust and the damp , the slow , sad death of a decay which no heart would sorrow for , nor any hand arrest . The days would come and go , the suns would rise and set , the nights would fall , and the waters flow , and the great stars throb above in the skies , and they would be there — alone . To her they were living things , beautiful and divine ; they were bound up with all the hours of her love ; and at their feet she had known the one brief dream of ecstacy that had sprung up for her , great and golden as the prophet ’s gourd , and as the gourd in a night had withered . She held them in a passionate tenderness — these , the first creatures who had spoken to her with a smile , and had brought light in to the darkness of her life . She flung herself on the ground and kissed its dust , and prayed for them in an agony of prayer — prayed for them that the hour might come , and come quickly , when men would see the greatness of their maker , and would remember them , and seek them , and bear them forth in honour and in worship to the nations . She prayed in an agony ; prayed blindly , and to whom she knew not ; prayed , in the sightless instinct of the human heart , towards some greater strength which could bestow at once retribution and consolation . Nor was it so much for him as for them that she thus prayed : in loving them she had reached the pure and impersonal passion of the artist . To have them live , she would have given her own life . Then the bonds of her torment seemed to be severed ; and , for the first time , she fell into a passion of tears , and stretched there on the floor of the forsaken chamber , wept as women weep upon a grave . When she arose , at length , she met the eyes of Hypnos and Oneiros and Thanatos — the gentle gods who give forgetfulness to men . They were her dear gods , her best beloved and most compassionate ; yet their looks struck coldly to her heart . Sleep , Dreams , and Death,—were these the only gifts with which the gods , being merciful , could answer prayer ? AT the little quay in the town many boats were lading and unlading , and many setting their sails to go southward with their loads of eggs or of birds , of flowers , of fruit or of herbage ; all smelling of summer rain and the odours of freshly ploughed earths turned up with the nest of the lark and the root of the cowslip laid bare in them . She lost herself in its little busy crowd , and learned what she needed without any asking , in turn , question of her . Arslàn had sailed at sunrise . There was a little boat , with an old man in it , loaded with Russian violets from a flower‐farm . The old man was angered and in trouble : the lad who steered for him had failed him , and the young men and boys on the canals were all too busy to be willing too the voyage for the wretched pittance he offered . She heard , and leaned towards him . “
175139	175145	175132	175132	you	4055	” The old man nodded . “
175154	175881	175146	175146	I	0	” she said to him ; and leaped down amongst his fragrant freight . He was a stranger to her , and let her be . She did for him as well as another , since she said that she knew those waters well . He was in haste , and , without more words , he loosened his sail , and cut his moor‐rope , and set his little vessel adrift down the water‐ways of the town , the violets filling the air with their odours and blue as the eyes of a child that wakes smiling . All the old familiar streets , all the dusky gateways and dim passages , all the ropes on which the lanterns and the linen hung , all the wide carved stairways water‐washed , all the dim windows that the women filled with pots of ivy and the song of birds,—she was drifting from them with every pulse of the tide , never again to return ; but she looked at them without seeing them , indifferent , and having no memory of them ; her brain , and her heart , and her soul were with the boat that she followed . It was the day of the weekly market . The broad flat‐bottomed boats were coming in at sunrise , in each some cargo of green food or of farm produce : a strong girl rowing with bare arms , and the sun catching the white glint of her head‐gear . Boys with coils of spotted birds ’ eggs , children with lapsful of wood‐gathered primroses , old women nursing a wicker cage of cackling hens or hissing geese , mules and asses , shaking their bells and worsted tassels , bearing their riders high on sheepskin saddles,—these all went by her on the river , or on the towing‐path , or on the broad high road that ran for a space by the water ’s edge . All of these knew her well ; all of these sometime of another had jeered her , jostled her , flouted her , or fled from her . But no one stopped her . No one cared enough for her to care even to wonder where she went . She glided out of the town , and along the banks she knew so well , and passed the wood and the orchards of Yprès . But what at another time would have had pain for her , and held her with the bonds of a sad familiarity , now scarcely moved her . One great grief and one great passion had drowned all these lesser woes , and scorched to ashes all slighter memories . All day long they sailed . At noon the old man gave her a little fruit and a crust as part of her wage ; she tried to eat them , knowing she would want all her strength . They left the course of the stream that she knew , and sailed further than she had ever sailed ; passed towns whose bells were ringing , and noble bridges gleaming in the sun , and water‐mills black and gruesome , and bright orchards and vineyards heavy with the promise of fruit . She knew none of them . There were only the water flowing under the keel , and the blue sky above , with the rooks circling in it , which had the look of friends to her . The twilight fell ; still the wind served , and still they held on ; the mists came , white and thick , and stars rose , and the voices from the shores sounded strangely , with here and there a note of music or the deep roll of a drum . So she drifted out of the old life into an unknown world . But she never once looked back . Why should she?—He had gone before . When it was quite night , they drew near to a busy town , whose lights glittered by hundreds and thousands on the bank . There were many barges and small boats at anchor in its wharves , hanging out lanterns at their mast‐heads . The old man bade her steer his boat amongst them , and with a cord he made it fast . “
175886	175897	175146	175146	I	0	” she asked , breathlessly . The old man laughed . “
175905	175906	175146	175146	I	0	” “
175916	175923	175907	175907	I	0	” The old man laughed again . “
175939	175957	175958	175958	You	0	” Her face set with an anger that made him wince , dull though his conscience was . “
175962	176280	176281	176282	The gipsy	4056	” she said , briefly ; and she climbed the boat ’s side , and shaking the violets off her , set her foot upon the pier , not stooping to waster more words . But a great terror fell on her . She had thought that the boat would bring her straight to Paris ; and , once in Paris , she had thought that it would be as easy to trace his steps as it had been in the little town that she had left . She had had no sense of distance — no knowledge of the size of cities ; the width , and noise , and hurry , and confusion of this one waterside town made her helpless and stupid . She stood like a young lost dog upon the flags of the landing‐place , not knowing whither to go , nor what to do . The old man , busied in unlading his violets into the wicker kreels of the women waiting for them , took no notice of her . He had used her so long as he had wanted her . There were incessant turmoil , outcry , and uproar round the landing‐stairs , where large cargoes of beetroot , cabbages , and fish were being put on shore . The buyers and the sellers screamed and swore ; the tawny light of oil‐lamps flickered over their furious faces ; the people jostled her , pushed her , cursed her , for being in the way . She shrank back in bewilderment and disgust , and walked feebly away from the edge of the river , trying to think , trying to get back her old health and her old force . The people of the streets were too occupied to take any heed of her . Only one ragged little boy danced before her a moment , shrieking , “

She went on , as though she were deaf , through the yelling of the children and the chattering and chaffering of the trading multitude . There was a little street leading off the quay , picturesque and ancient , with parquetted houses and quaint painted signs ; at the corner of it sat an old woman on a wooden stool , with a huge fan of linen on her head like a mushroom . She was selling roasted chestnuts by the glare of a little horn lantern . By this woman she paused , and asked the way to Paris . “

176520	176603	176515	176515	I	0	” She did not know even what this epithet of gipsy , which they so often cast at her , really meant . She remembered the old life of the Liébana , but she did not know what manner of life it had been ; and since Phratos had left her there , no one of his tribe or of his kind had been seen in the little Norman town among the orchards . The old woman grinned , trimming her lantern . “
176629	176655	176618	176618	You	0	” And she began to count her chestnuts , lest this stranger should steal any of them . Folle‐Farine took no notice of the words . “
176667	176701	176657	176657	you	0	” she asked . Meanwhile the street boy had brought three or four of his comrades to stare at her ; and they were dancing round her with grotesque grimace , and singing , “
176714	176806	176657	176657	you	0	” The woman directed her which roads to go as well as she could for the falling darkness , and she thanked the woman and went . The street children ran at her heels like little curs , yelling and hissing foul language ; but she ran too , and was swifter than they , and outstripped them , the hardy training of her limbs standing her in good service . How far she ran , or what streets she traversed , she could not tell ; the chestnut‐seller had said . “
176813	177705	176811	176811	you	4071	” and the star was shining behind her always , and she ran south steadily . Great buildings , lighted casements , high stone walls , groups of people , troopers drinking , girls laughing , men playing dominoes in the taverns , women chattering in the coffee‐houses , a line of priests going to a death‐bed with the bell ringing before the Host , a line of soldiers filing through great doors as the drums beat the return into barracks,—thousands of these pictures glowed in her path a moment , with the next to fade and give place to others . But she looked neither to the right or left , and held on straightly for the south . Once or twice a man halloed after her , or a soldier tried to stop her . Once , going through the gateway in the southern wall , a sentinel challenged her , and levelled his bayonet only a second too late . But she eluded them all by the swiftness of her apparition , and she got out safe beyond the barriers of the town , and on to the road that led to the country,—a road quiet and white in the moonlight , and bordered on either side with the tall poplars and the dim , bare , reapen fields which looked to her like dear familiar friends . It was lonely , and she sat down on a stone by the wayside and rested . She had no hesitation in what she was doing . He had gone south , and she would go likewise ; that she might fail to find him there , never occurred to her . Of what a city was she had not yet any conception ; her sole measurement of one was the little towns whither she had driven the mules to sell the fruits and the fowls for Flamma . To have been cheated of Paris , and to find herself thus far distant from it appalled her , and made her heart sink . But it had no power to make her hesitate in the course she took . She had no fear and no doubt : the worst thing that could have come to her had come already ; the silence and the strength of absolute despair were on her . Besides , a certain thrill of liberty was on her . For the first time in all her life she was absolutely free , with the freedom of the will and of the body both . She was no longer captive to one place , bondslave to one tyranny ; she was no longer driven with curses and commands , and yoked and harnessed every moment of her days . To her , with the blood of a tameless race in her , there was a certain force and elasticity in this deliverance from bondage , that lifted some measure of her great woe off her . She could not be absolutely wretched so long as the open sky was above her , and the smell of the fields about her , and on her face the breath of the blowing winds . She had that love which is as the bezoar stone of fable — an amulet that makes all wounds unfelt , and death a thing to smile at in derision . Besides , there was in her veins a certain thrill of the sweetness of liberty . She was no longer captive to one place , or bound in the old bonds of servitude . She was free — with the freedom of the will and of the body . Without some strong impulsion from without , she might never have cut herself adrift from the tyranny that had held her down from childhood ; and even the one happiness she had known had been but little more than the exchange of one manner of slavery for another . But now she was free — absolutely free ; and in the calm , cool night — in the dusk and the solitude , with the smell of the fields around her , and above her the stars , she knew it and was glad,—glad even amidst the woe of loneliness and the agony of abandonment . She sat awhile by the roadside and counted his gold by the gleam of the stars , and put it away securely in her girdle , and drank from the brook beside her , and tried to eat a little of the bread which the old boat‐man had given her as her wages , with three pieces of copper money . But the crust choked her ; she felt hot with fever , and her throat was parched and full of pain . The moon was full upon her where she sat ; the red and white of her dress bore a strange look ; her face was colourless , and her eyes looked but the larger and more lustrous for the black shadows beneath them , and the weary swollen droop of their lids . She rested there , and pondered on the next step she had best take . A woman came past her , and stopped and looked . The moonlight was strong upon her face . “
177712	177725	177708	177710	a handsome wench	4073	” said the wayfarer , who was elderly and of pleasant visage ; “

177750	177783	177804	177805	a lover	6231	” she answered . The old reserve clung to her and fenced her secret in , as the prickles of a cactus hedge may fence in the magnolia ’s flower of snow . “
177793	177794	177804	177805	a lover	6231	” “

177807	177826	177804	177805	a lover	6231	” Folle‐Farine ’s lips grew whiter , and she shrank a little ; but she answered , steadily : “
177829	177830	177804	177805	a lover	6231	” “
177873	177874	177875	177875	I	0	” “

177913	177971	177903	177903	I	0	” Folle‐Farine opened her great eyes wide . It was the first creature who had ever offered her hospitality . It was an old woman , too ; there could be nothing but kindness in the offer , she thought ; and kindness was so strange to her , that it troubled her more than did cruelty . “
177976	177980	177972	177972	You	4072	” she said , gratefully,—“very

178024	178031	178022	178022	you	4072	” The old woman laughed roughly . “
178054	178055	178056	178056	I	0	” “
178064	178065	178056	178056	I	0	” “
178181	178182	178183	178183	You	4072	” “
178215	179249	178204	178204	I	0	” She spoke in all unconsciousness , in her heart thankful to this , the first human creature that had ever offered her shelter or good nature . The woman darted one sharp look at her , venomous as an adder ’s bite ; then bade her a short good‐night , and went on her way to the gates of the town . Folle‐Farine rose up and walked on , taking her own southward road . She was ignorant of any peril that she had escaped . She did not know that the only animals which prey upon the young of their own sex and kind are women . She was very tired ; long want of sleep , anguish , and bodily fatigue made her dull , and too exhausted to keep long upon her feet . She looked about her for some place of rest ; and she knew that if she did not husband her strength , it might fail her ere she reached him , and stretch her on a sick‐bed in some hospital of the poor . She passed two of three cottages standing by the roadside , with light gleaming through their shutters ; but she did not knock at any one of them . She was afraid of spending her three copper coins ; and she was too proud to seek food or lodging as an alms . By‐and‐by when came to a little shed , standing where no house was . She looked in it , and saw it full of the last season ’s hay , dry and sweet‐smelling , tenanted only by a cat rolled round in slumber . She crept into it , and laid herself down and slept , the bright starry skies shining on her through the open space that served for entrance , the clatter of a little brook under the poplar trees the only sound upon the quiet air . Footsteps went past twice or thrice , and once a waggon rolled lumbering by ; but no one came thither to disturb her , and she sank into a fitful heavy sleep . At daybreak she was again afoot , always on the broad road to the south‐west . With one of her coins she bought a loaf and a draught of milk , at a hamlet through which she went . She was surprised to find that people spoke to her without a curse or taunt , and dealt with her as with any other human being . Insensibly with the change of treatment , and with the fresh sweet air , and with the brisk movement that bore her on her way , her heart grew lighter , and her old dauntless spirit rose again . She would find him , she thought , as soon as ever she entered Paris ; and she would watch over him , and only go near him if he needed her . And then , and then—. But her thoughts went no further . She shut the future out from her ; it appalled her . Only one thing was clear before her — that she would get him the greatness that he thirsted for , if any payment of her body or her soul , life or death , could purchase it . A great purpose nerves the life it lives in , so that no personal terrors can assail , nor any minor woes afflict it . Hunger , thirst , fatigue , hardship , danger,—these were all in her path , and she had each in turn ; but not one of them unnerved her . To reach Paris , she felt that she would have walked through flames , or fasted forty days . For two days and nights she went on — days cloudless , nights fine and mild ; then came a day of storm — sharp hail and loud thunder . She went on through it all the same , the agony in her heart made the glare of lightning and the roar of winds no more to her than the sigh of an April breeze over a primrose bank . She had various fortunes on her way . A party of tramps crossing a meadow set on her , and tried to insult her ; she showed them her knife , and with the blade bare against her throat , made them fall back , and scattered them . A dirty and tattered group of gipsies , squatting in a dry ditch under a tarpaulin , hailed her , and wanted her to join with them and share their broken food . She eluded them with disgust ; they were not like the gitanos of Liébana , and she took them to be beggars and thieves , as indeed , they were . At a little wayside cabin , a girl , with a bright rosy face , spoke softly and cheerily to her , and bade her rest awhile on the bench in the porch under the vines ; and brought out some white pigeons to show her ; and asked her , with interest , whence she came . And she , in her fierceness and her shyness , was touched , and wondered greatly that any female thing could be thus good . She met an old man with an organ on his back , and a monkey on his shoulder . He was old and infirm . She carried his organ for him awhile , as they went along the same road ; and he was gentle and kind in return , and made the route she had to take clear to her , and told her , with a shake of his head that Paris would either be hell or heaven to such as she . And she , hearing , smiled a little , for the first time since she had left Yprès , and thought — heaven or hell , what would it matter which , so long as she found Arslàn ? Of Dante she had never heard ; but the spirit of the “
179258	180228	180230	180230	you	4094	” dwells untaught in every great love . Once , at night , a vagrant tried to rob her , having watched her count the gold and notes which she carried in her girdle . He dragged her to a lonely place , and snatched at the red sash , grasping the money with it ; but she was too quick for him , and beat him off in such a fashion that he slunk away limping , and told his fellows to beware of her ; for she had the spring of a cat , and the stroke of a swan ’s wing . On the whole , the world seemed better to her than it had done : the men were seldom insolent , taking warning from the look in her flashing eyes and the straight carriage of her flexible frame ; and the women more than once were kind . Many peasants passed her on their market‐mules , and many carriers ’ carts and farm‐waggons went by along the sunny roads . Sometimes their drivers called to her to get up , and gave her a lift of a league or two on their piles of grass , or straw , or amongst their crates of cackling poultry , as they made their slow way between the lines of the trees , with their horses nodding heavily under the weight of their uncouth harness . All this while she never touched the gold that he had given her . Very little food sufficed to her : she had been hardly reared ; and for the little she had she worked always , on her way . A load carried , a lost sheep fetched in , some wood hewn and stacked , a crying calf fed , a cabbage‐patch dug or watered , these got her the simple fare which she fed on ; and for lodging she was to none indebted , preferring to lie down by the side of the cows in their stalls , or under a stack against some little blossoming garden . The people had no prejudice against her : she found few foes , when she had left the district that knew the story of Reine Flamma ; they were , on the contrary , amused with her strange picture‐like look , and awed with the sad brevity of her speech to them . Sometimes it chanced to her to get no tasks of any sort to do , and at these times she went without food : touch his gold she would not . On the road she did what good she could ; she walked a needless league to carry home a child who had broken his leg in a lonely lane ; she sought , in a foggy night , for the straying goat of a wretched woman ; she saved an infant from the flames in a little cabin burning in the midst of the green fields : she did what came in her path to do . For her heart was half broken ; and this was her way of prayer . So , by tedious endeavour , she won her passage wearily towards Paris . She had been nine days on the road , losing her way at times , and having often wearily to retrace her steps . On the tenth day she came to a little town lying in a green hollow amidst woods . It had an ancient church ; the old sweet bells were ringing a last midday mass ; a crumbling fortress of the Angevine kings gave it majesty and shadow ; it was full of flowers and of trees , and had quaint , quiet , grey streets , hilly and shady , that made her think of the streets round about the cathedral of her mother ’s birthplace , away north‐westward in the white sea‐mists . When she entered it , noon had just sounded from all its many clocks and chimes . The weather was hot , and she was very tired . She had not eaten any food , save some berries and green leaves , for more than forty hours . She had been refused anything to do in all places ; and she had no money — except that gold of his . There was a little tavern , vine‐shaded , and bright with a late‐flowering rose that hid its casements . She asked there , timidly , if there were any task she might do,—to fetch water , to sweep , to break wood , to drive or to stable a mule or a horse ? They took her to be a gipsy ; they ordered her roughly to be gone . Through the square window she could see food — a big juicy melon cut in halves , sweet yellow cakes , warm and crisp from the oven , a white chicken , cold and dressed with cresses , a jug of milk , an abundance of bread . And her hunger was very great . Nine days of sharper privation than even that to which she had been inured in the penury of Yprès had made her cheeks hollow and her limbs fleshless ; and a continual consuming heat and pain gnawed at her chest . She sat on a bench that was free to all wayfarers , and looked at the food in the tavern‐kitchen . It tempted her with the animal ravenousness begotten by long fast . She wanted to fly at it as a starved dog flies . A rosy‐faced woman cut up the chicken on a china dish , singing . Folle‐Farine , outside , looked at her , and took courage from her smiling face . “
180237	180241	180230	180230	you	4094	” she murmured . “
180253	180254	180255	180255	You	0	” “
180260	180269	180255	180255	You	0	” answered the woman , ceasing to smile . “
180276	180414	180272	180274	your own folk	4096	” And she would not offer her even a plate of broken victuals . Folle‐Farine rose and walked wearily away . She could not bear the sight of the food ; she felt that if she looked at it longer she would spring on it like a wolf . But to use his gold never occurred to her . She would have bitten her tongue through in famine ere she would have taken one coin of it . As she went , being weak from long hunger and the stroke of the sun‐rays , she stumbled and fell . She recovered herself quickly ; but in the fall the money had shaken itself from her sash , and been scattered with a ringing sound among the stones . The woman in the tavern‐window raised a loud cry . “
180453	180833	180436	180437	a rogue	5969	” The woman cried loud ; there were half‐a‐dozen stout serving‐wenches and stable‐lads about in the little street , with several boys and children . Indignant at the thought of an attempted fraud upon their charity , and amazed at the flash and the fall of the money , they rushed on her with shrieks of rage and scorn , with missiles of turf and stone , with their brooms raised aloft , or their dogs set to rage at her . She had not time to gather up the coins and notes ; she could only stand over them and defend them . Two beggar‐boys made snatch at the tempting heap ; she drew her knife to daunt them with the sight of it . The people shrieked at sight of the bare blade ; a woman selling honeycomb and lots of honey at a bench under a lime‐tree raised a cry that she had been robbed . It was not true ; but a street crowd always loves a lie , and never risks spoiling , by sifting , it . The beggar‐lads and the two serving‐wenches and an old virago from a cottage‐door near set upon her , and scrambled together to drive her away from the gold and share it . Resolute to defend it at any peril , she set her heel down on it , and , with her back against the tree , stood firm ; not striking , but with the point of the knife outward . One of the boys , maddened to get the gold , darted forward , twisted his limbs round her , and struggled with her for its possession . In the struggle he wounded himself upon the steel . His arm bled largely ; he filled the air with his shrieks ; the people , furious , accused her of his murder . Before five minutes had gone by she was seized , overpowered by numbers , cuffed , kicked , upbraided with every name of infamy , and dragged as a criminal up the little steep stony street in the blaze of the noonday sun , whilst on each side the townsfolk looked out from their doorways and their balconies , and cried out : “
180878	180887	180890	180894	A thief of a gipsy	4105	” To which the groups called back again , “
180927	180946	180911	180911	Fréki	237	” And the people above , in horror , lifted their hands and eyes , and shouted afresh , “
180951	181751	180911	180911	Fréki	237	” Meanwhile the honey‐seller ran beside them , crying aloud that she had been robbed of five broad gold pieces . It was a little sunny country‐place , very green with trees and grass , filled usually with few louder sounds than the cacklings of geese and the dripping of well‐water . But its stones were sharp and rough ; its voices were shrill and fierce ; its gossips were cruel and false of tongue ; its justice was very small , and its credulity was measureless . A girl , bare‐foot and bare‐headed , with eyes of the East , and a knife in her girdle , teeth that met in their youngsters ’ wrists , and gold pieces that scattered like dust from her bosom,—such an one could have no possible innocence in their eyes , such an one was condemned so soon as she was looked at , when she was dragged amongst them up their hilly central way . She had had money on her , and she had asked for food in the plea of being starved ; that was fraud plain enough , even for those who were free to admit that the seller of the honey‐pots had never been over‐true of speech , and had never owned so much as five gold pieces ever since her first bees had sucked their first spray of heath‐bells . No one had any mercy on a creature who had money , and yet asked for work ; as to her guilt , there could be no question . She was hurried before the village tribune , and cast into the cell where all accused waited their judgement . It was a dusky , loathsome place , dripping with damp , half underground , strongly grilled with iron , and smelling foully from the brandy and strong smoke of two drunkards who had been its occupants the previous night . There they had left her , taking away her knife and her money . She did not resist . It was not her nature to rebel futilely ; and they had fallen on her six to one , and had bound her safely with cords ere they had dragged her away to punishment . The little den was visible to the highway through a square low grating . Through this they came and stared , and mouthed , and mocked , and taunted , and danced before her . To bait a gipsy was fair pastime . Everywhere , from door to door , the blind cobbler , with his little son , and the woman who sold honey told their tale,—how she had stabbed the little lad and stolen the gold that the brave bees had brought their mistress , and begged for food when she had money enough on her to buy a rich man ’s feast . It was a tale to enlist against her all the hardest animosities of the poor . The village rose against her in all its little homes as though she had borne fire and sword into its midst . If the arm of the law had not guarded the entrance of her prison‐cell , the women would have stoned her to death , or dragged her out to drown in the pond:—she was worse than a murderess in their sight ; and one weak man , thinking to shelter her a little from their rage , quoted against her her darkest crime when he pleaded for mercy for her because she was young and was so handsome . The long hot day of torment passed slowly by . Outside there were cool woods , flower‐filled paths , broad fields of grass , children tossing blow‐balls down the wind , lovers counting the leaves of yellow‐eyed autumn daisies ; but within there were only foul smells , intense nausea , cruel heats , the sting of a thousand insects , the buzz of a hundred carrion‐flies , muddy water , and black mouldy bread . She held her silence . She would not let her enemies see that they hurt her . When they day had gone down , and the people had tired of their sport and left her a little while , an old feeble man stole timidly to her , glancing round lest any should see his charity and quote is as a crime , and tendered her through the bars with a gentle hand a little ripe autumnal fruit upon a cool green leaf . The kindness made the tears start to eyes too proud to weep for pain . She took the grapes , and thanked him lovingly and thankfully ; cooled her aching , burning , dust‐drenched throat with their fragrant moisture . “
181758	181773	180911	180911	Fréki	237	” he whispered , frightenedly , glancing over his shoulder lest any should see . “
181794	181795	181783	181783	you	0	” “
181800	181805	181783	181783	you	0	” she answered him . “
181814	181815	181783	181783	you	0	” “
181821	181833	181783	181783	you	0	” The old man stared at her , trembling and amazed . “
181851	181860	181881	181881	child	1265	” A dreary smile came on her face . “
181868	181869	181870	181870	Inhuman	240	” “
181872	181876	181870	181870	Inhuman	240	” he murmured . “
181896	182901	182902	182904	The fourth bull	4112	” And he stole away sorrowful , because sure that for his fruit of charity she had given him back a lie . He shambled away , afraid that his neighbours should see the little thing which he had done . She was left alone . It began to grow dark . She felt scorched with fever , and her head throbbed . Long hunger , intense fatigue , and all the agony of thought in which she had struggled on her way , had their reaction on her . She shivered where she sat on the damp straw which they had cast upon the stones ; and strange noises sang in her ears , and strange lights glimmered and flashed before her eyes . She did not know what ailed her . The dogs came and smelt at her , and one little early robin sang a twilight song in an elder‐bush near . These were the only things that had any pity on her . By‐and‐by , when it was quite night , they opened the grated door and thrust in another captive , a vagrant whom they had found drunk or delirious on the high road , and whom they locked up for the night , that on the morrow they might determine what to do with him . He threw himself heavily forward as he was pushed in by the old soldier whose place it was to guard the miserable den . She shrank away into the furthest corner of the den , and crouched there , breathing heavily , and staring with dull , dilated eyes . She thought — surely they could not mean to leave them there alone , all the night through , in the horrible darkness ? The slamming of the iron door answered her ; and the old soldier , as he turned the rusty key in the lock , grumbled that the world was surely at a pretty pass , when two tramps became too coy to roost together . And he stumbled up the ladder‐like stairs of the guard‐house to his own little chamber ; and there , smoking and drinking , and playing dominoes with a comrade , dismissed the prisoners from his recollection . Meanwhile , the man whom he had thrust into the cell was stretched where he had fallen , drunk or insensible , and moaning heavily . She , crouching against the wall , as though praying the stones to yield and hold her , gazed at him with horror and pity that together strove in the confusion of her dizzy brain , and made her dully wonder whether she were wicked thus to shrink in loathing from a creature in distress so like her own . The bright moon rose on the other side of the trees beyond the grating ; it fell across the figure of the vagrant whom they had locked in with her , as in the wild‐beast shows of old they locked a lion with an antelope in the same cage — out of sport . She saw the looming massive shadow of an immense form , crouched like a couching beast ; she saw the fire of burning , wide‐open , sullen eyes ; she saw the restless , feeble gesture of two lean hands , that clutched at the barren stones with the futile action of a chained vulture clutching at his rock ; she saw that the man suffered horribly , and she tried to pity him — tried not to shrink from him — tried to tell herself that he might be as guiltless as was herself . But she could not prevail ; nature , instinct , youth , sex , sickness , exhaustion , all conquered her , and broke her strength . She recoiled from the unbearable loathsomeness of such association ; she sprang to the grated aperture , and seized the iron in her hands , and shook it with al her might , and tore at it , and bruised her chest and arms against it , and clung to it convulsively , shriek after shriek pealing from her lips . No one heard , or no one answered to her prayer . A stray dog came and howled in unison ; the moon sailed on behind the trees ; the old soldier above slept over his toss of brandy ; at the only dwelling near they were dancing at a bridal , and had no ear to hear . The passionate outcries wailed themselves to silence on her trembling mouth ; her strained hands gave way from their hold on the irons ; she grew silent from sheer exhaustion , and dropped in a heap at the foot of the iron door , clinging to it , and crushed against it , and turning her face to the night without , feeling some little sense of solace in the calm , clear moon;—some little sense of comfort in the near presence of the dog . Meanwhile the dusky prostrate form of the man had not stirred . He had not spoken , save to curse heaven and earth and every living thing . He had not ceased to glare at her with eyes that had the red light of a tiger ’s in their pain . He was a man of superb stature and frame ; he was worn by disease and delirium , but he had in him a wild , leonine , tawny beauty still . His clothes were of rags , and his whole look was of wretchedness ; yet there was about him a certain reckless majesty and splendour still , as the scattered beams of the white moonlight broke themselves upon him . Of a sudden he spoke aloud , with a glitter of terrible laughter on his white teeth and his flashing eyes . He was delirious , and had no consciousness of where he was . “
183085	183133	183826	183826	you	4120	” Then he laughed loud again ; and , laughing , sang — The rich loud challenge of the love‐song snapped short in two . With a groan and a curse he flung himself on the mud floor , and clutched at it with his empty hands . “
183136	183805	183826	183826	you	4120	” he moaned , lying athirst there as the red bull had lain on the sands of the circus ; longing for the purple draughts of his old feast‐nights , as the red bull had longed for the mountain‐streams , so cold and strong , of his own Andalusian birthplace . Then he laughed again , and sang old songs of Spain , broken and marred by discord — their majestic melodies wedded strangely to many a stave of lewd riot and of amorous verse . Then for awhile he was quiet , moaning dully , staring upward at the white face of the moon . After a while he mocked it — the cold , chaste thing that was the meek trickster of so many mole‐eyed lords . Through the terror and the confusion of her mind , with the sonorous melody of the tongue , with the flaming darkness of his eyes , with the wild barbaric dissolute grandeur of this shattered manhood , vague memories floated , distorted and intangible , before her . Of deep forests whose shade was cool even in midsummer and midday ; of glancing torrents rushing through their beds of stone ; of mountain snows flushing in sunset toll the hues of the mountain roses that grew by millions by the river‐water ; of wondrous nights , sultry and serene , in which women with flashing glances and bare breasts danced with their spangled anklets glittering in the rays of the moon ; of roofless palaces where the Crescent still glistened amidst the colours of the walls ; of marble courts where only the oleander kept pomp and the wild fig‐vine held possession ; of a dead nation which at midnight thronged through the tombs of its kings , and passed in shadowy hosts through the fated land which had rejected the faith and the empire of Islam ; sowing as they went upon the blood‐soaked soil of Spain the vengeance of the dead in pestilence , in anarchy , in barren passions , in endless riot and revolt , so that no sovereign should ever sit in peace on the ruined throne of the Moslem , and no light shine ever again upon the people whose boast it once had been on them the sun in heaven never set:—all these memories floated before her , and only served to make her fear more ghastly , her horror more unearthly . There he lay delirious — a madman chained there at her feet , so close in the little den , that , shrink as she would against the wall , she could barely keep from the touch of his hands as they were flung forth in the air , from the scorch of his breath as he raved and cursed . And there was no light except the fire in his eyes ; except the flicker of the moonbeam through the leaves . She spent her strength in piteous shrieks . They were the first cries that had ever broken from her lips for human aid ; and they were vain . The guard above slept heavy with brandy and a dotard ’s dreams . The village was not aroused . What cared any of its sleepers how these outcasts fared ? She crouched in the farthest corner , when her voice had spent itself in the passion of appeal . The night — would it ever end ? Beside its horror , all the wretchedness and bondage of her old life seemed like peace and freedom . Writhing in pain and frenzy , the wounded drunkard struck her — all unconscious of the blow — across her eyes , and fell , contorted and senseless , with his head upon her knees . He had ceased to shout his amorous songs , and vaunt his lustful triumphs . His voice was hollow in his throat , and babbled with a strange sound , low and fast and inarticulate . “
183818	183822	183826	183826	you	4120	” he muttered . “
184054	184224	184046	184046	she	4131	” * * * * * * When , at daylight , the people unbarred the prison‐door , they found the sightless face of the dead mean lying full in the light of the sun : beside him the girl crouched with a senseless stare in the horror of her eyes , and on her lips a ghastly laugh . For Folle‐Farine had entered at last into her Father ’s kingdom . FOR many months she knew nothing of the flight of time . All she was conscious of were burning intolerable pain , continual thirst , and the presence as of an iron hand upon her head , weighing down the imprisoned brain . All she saw in the horrible darkness , which no ray of light ever broke , was the face of Thanatos , with the white rose pressed against his mouth , to whom endlessly she stretched her arms in vain entreaty , but who said only , with the passionless pity of his gaze , “
184245	184294	184046	184046	she	4131	” She lived , as a reed torn up from the root may live , by the winds that waft it , by the birds that carry it , by the sands that draw its fibres down into themselves , to root afresh whether it will or no . “
184307	184689	184690	184692	The old gods	4134	” was all that she said , again and again , lying staring with her hot distending eyes into the void as of perpetual night , which was all that she saw around her . The words were to those who heard her , however , the mere meaningless babble of madness . When they had found her in the cell of the guardhouse , she was far beyond any reach of harm from them , or any sensibility of the worst which they might do to her . She was in a delirious stupor , which left her no more sense of place , or sound , or time than if her brain had been drugged to the agonies and ecstasies of the opium‐eater . They found her homeless , friendless , nameless ; a thing accursed , destitute , unknown ; as useless and as rootless as the dead Spanish vagrant lying on the stones beside her . They cast him to the public ditch ; they sent her to the public sick wards , a league away ; an ancient palace , whose innumerable chambers and whose vast corridors had been given to a sisterhood of mercy , and employed for nigh a century as a public hospital . In this prison she lay without any sense of the passing of hours and days and months . The accusation against her fell to the ground harmless ; no one pursued it : the gold was gone — somewhere , nowhere . No one knew , unless it were the bee‐wife , and she held her peace . She was borne , senseless , to the old hospice in the great , dull , saintly , historic town , and there perished from all memories as all time perished to her . Once or twice the sister of charity who had the charge of her sought to exorcise the demon tormenting this stricken brain and burning body , by thrusting into the hands that clenched the air a leaden image or a cross of sacred wood . But those heathen hands , even in delirium , threw those emblems away always , and the captive would mutter , in a vague incoherence that froze the blood of her hearers : “
184848	185381	185382	185382	I	0	” And then her voice would rise in a passion of hysteric weeping , or sink away into the feeble wailing of the brain , mortally stricken , and yet dimly sensible of its own madness and weakness ; and all through the hours she , in her unconsciousness , would lament for this — for this alone — that the gods had not deemed her worthy of the stroke of death by which , through her , a divine melody might have arisen , and saved the world . For the fable — which had grown to hold the place of so implicit a faith to her — was in her delirium always present with her ; and she had retained no sense of herself except as the bruised and trampled reed which man and the gods alike had rejected as unworthy of sacrifice . All the late autumn and the early winter came and went ; and the cloud was dark upon her mind , and the pain of the blow dealt to her by Taric ’s hand gnawed at her brain . When the winter turned , the darkness in which her reason had been engulphed began to clear , little by little . As the first small trill of the wren stirred the silence in the old elm boughs ; as the first feeble gleam of the new year sunshine struggled through the matted branches of the yews ; as the first frail blossom of the pale hepatica timidly peeped forth in the damp moss‐grown walls without , so consciousness slowly returned to her . She was so young ; the youth in her refused to be quenched , and recovered its hold upon life as did the song of the birds , the light in the skies , the corn in the seed‐sown earth . She awakened to strength , to health , to knowledge ; she awoke thus blinded and confused , and capable of little save the sense of some loathsome bondage , of some irreparable loss , of some great duty which she had left undone , of some great errand to which she had been summoned , and found wanting . She saw four close stone walls around her ; she saw her wrists and her ankles bound ; she saw a hole high above her head , braced with iron bars , which served to let in the few pallid streaks of daylight which alone ever found their way thither ; she saw a black cross in one corner , and before it two women in black , who prayed . She tried to rise and could not : being fettered . She tore at the rope on her wrists with her teeth like a young tigress at her chains . They essayed to soothe her , but in vain ; they then made trial first of threats , than of coercion ; neither affected her ; she bit at the knotted cords with her white strong teeth , and , being unable to free herself , fell backward into a savage despair , glaring in mute impotent rage upon her keepers . “
185388	185395	185396	185396	I	0	” she muttered again and again . “
185402	185585	185396	185396	I	0	” So much escaped her;—but her secret she was still strong to keep buried in silence in her heart , as she had still kept it even in her madness . Her old strength , her old patience , her old ferocity and stubbornness and habits of mute resistance had revived in her with the return of life and reason . Slowly she remembered all things,—remembered that she had been accused and hunted down as a thief and brought thither into this prison , as she deemed it , where the closeness of the walls pent her in and shut out the clouds and the stars , the water and the moonrise , the flicker of the green leaves against the gold of sunset , and all the liberty and loveliness of earth and air for which she was devoured by a continual thirst of longing , like the thirst of the caged lark for the fair heights of heaven . So when they spoke of their god , she answered always as the lark answers when his gaolers speak to him of song;—“Set
185589	185853	185396	185396	I	0	” But they thought this madness no less , and kept her bound there in the little dark stone den where no sound ever reached , unless it were the wailing of a bell , and no glimpse of the sky or the trees could ever come to charm to peaceful rest her aching eyes . At length they grew afraid of what they did . She refused all food ; she turned her face to the wall ; she stretched herself on her bed of straw motionless and rigid . The confinement , the absence of air , were a living death to the creature whose lungs were stifled unless they drank in the fresh cool draught of winds blowing unchecked over the widths of the fields and forests , and whose eyes ached and grew blind unless they could gaze into the depths of free‐flowing water , or feed themselves in far‐reaching sight upon the radiant skies . The errant passions in her , the inborn instincts towards perpetual liberty , and the life of the desert and of the mountains which came with the blood of the Zingari , made her prison‐house a torture to her such as is unknown to the house‐born and hearth‐fettered races . If this wild moorbird died of self‐imposed famine rather than live only to beat its cut wings against the four walls of their pent prison‐house , it might turn ill for themselves ; so the religious community meditated . They became afraid of their own work . One day they said to her : “
185866	185893	185396	185396	I	0	” She turned for the first time and lifted her face from the straw in which she buried it , and looked them in the eyes . “
185898	185902	185396	185396	I	0	” she asked . “
185905	185910	185911	185911	We	4141	” they answered her . “
185922	185923	185911	185911	We	4141	” “
185934	186013	185911	185911	We	4141	” she said , with the smile that froze their timid blood . But she accepted the food and the drink which they brought her , and broke her fast , and slept through many hours ; strengthened , as by strong wine , by that one hope of freedom beneath the wide pure skies . She asked them on awakening what the season of the year was then . They told her it was the early spring . “
186017	186062	185911	185911	We	4141	” she echoed dully,—all the months were a blank to her , which had rolled by since that red autumn evening , when in the cell of the guard‐house the voice of Taric had chaunted in drink and delirium the passion songs of Spain . “
186069	186191	185911	185911	We	4141	” they said ; and one sister , younger and gentler than the rest , reached from its place above the crucifix the bough of the golden catkins of the willow , which served them at their holy season as an emblem of the palms of Palestine . She looked at the drooping grace of the branches , with their buds of amber , long and in silence ; then with a passion of weeping she turned her face from them as from the presence of some intolerable memory . All down the shore of the river , amongst the silver of the reeds , the willows had been in blossom when she had first looked upon the face of Arslàn . “
186196	186223	185911	185911	We	4141	” the women murmured , drawn to her by the humanity of those , the first , tears that she had ever shed in her imprisonment . “
186247	186254	186234	186234	we	4144	” She shook her head wearily . “
186263	186647	186260	186260	I	0	” she murmured . Peace ? He would care nothing for peace on earth or in heaven , she knew . What she had sought to gain for him — what she would seek still when once she should get free — was the eternal conflict of a great fame in the world of men . Since this was the only fate which in his sight had any grace or any glory in it . They kept their faith with her . They opened the doors of her prison‐house and bade her depart in peace , pagan and criminal though they deemed her . She reeled a little dizzily as the first blaze of the full daylight fell on her . She walked out with unsteady steps into the open air where they took her , and felt it cool and fresh upon her cheek , and saw the blue sky above her . The gates which they unbarred were those at the back of the hospital , where the country stretched around . They did not care that she should be seen by the people of the streets . She was left alone on a road outside the great building that had been her prison‐house ; the road was full of light , it was straight and shadowless ; there was a tall tree near her full of leaf ; there was a little bird fluttering in the sand at her feet ; the ground was wet , and sparkled with rain drops . All these little things came to her like the notes of a song heard far away — far away — in another world . They were so familiar , yet so strange . There was a little yellow flower growing in a tuft of grasses straight in front of her ; a little wayside weed ; a root and blossom of the field‐born celandine . She fell on her knees in the dust by it , and laughed and wept , and quivering , kissed it and blessed it that it grew there . It was the first thing of summer and of sunshine she had seen so long . A man in the gateway saw her and shook her , and bade her get from the ground . “
186656	186660	186661	186661	you	4146	” he muttered ; “
186670	186946	186667	186667	I	0	” Like a hunted animal she stumbled to her feet and fled from him ; winged by the one ghastly terror that they would claim her and chain her back again . They had said that she was free : but what were words ? They had taken her once ; they might take her twice . She ran , and ran , and ran . The intense fear that possessed her lent her irresistible force . She coursed the earth with the swiftness of a hare . She took no heed whence she went ; she only knew that she fled from the one unutterable horror of that place . She thought they were right ; that she was mad . It was a level green silent country which was round her , with little loveliness and little colour ; but as she went she laughed incessantly in the delirious gladness of her liberty . She tossed her head back to watch the flight of a single swallow ; she caught a handful of green leaves and buried her face in them . She listened in a very agony of memory to the rippling moisture of a little brook . She followed with her eyes the sweeping vapours of the rain‐clouds , and when a west wind rose and blew a cluster of loose apple blossoms between her eyes — she could no longer bear the passionate pain of all the long‐lost sweetness , but flinging herself downward , sobbed with the ecstasy of an exile ’s memories . The hell in which she had dwelt had denied them to her for so long . “
186950	186954	186667	186667	I	0	” she thought , “
186981	187352	186260	186260	I	0	” And she arose , calmer , and went on her way ; wondering , even in that hour , why men and women trod the daily measures of their lives with their eyes downward and their ears choked with the dust ; hearkening so little to the sound of the breeze in the grasses , looking so little to the passage of the clouds against the sun . When the first blindness and rapture of her liberty had a little passed away , and abated in violence , she stood in the midst of the green fields and the fresh woods , a strange , sad , lonely figure of absolute desolation . Her clothes were in rags ; her red girdle had been changed by weather to a dusky purple ; her thick clustering hair had been cut to her throat ; her radiant hues were blanched , and her immense eyes gazed woefully from beneath their heavy dreamy lids , like the eyes of an antelope whom men vainly starve in the attempt to tame . She knew neither where to go nor what to do . She had not a coin nor a crust upon her . She could not tell where she then stood , nor where the only home that she had ever known might lie . She had not a friend on earth and she was seventeen years old , and was beautiful and was a woman . She stood and looked ; she did not weep ; she did not pray ; her heart seemed frozen in her . She had the gift she had craved;—and how could she use it ? The light was obscured by the clouds , great sweet rain clouds which came trooping from the west . Woods were all round , and close against her were low brown cattle , cropping clovered grass . Away on the horizon was a vague , vast golden cloud , like a million threads of gossamer glowing in the sun . She did not know what it was ; yet it drew her eyes to it . A herdsman came by her to the cattle . She pointed to the cloud . “
187358	187369	186260	186260	I	0	” she asked him . The cowherd stared and laughed . “
187388	187389	188222	188223	A‐h‐h‐. Women	4148	” “
187392	187813	188222	188223	A‐h‐h‐. Women	4148	” She echoed the name with a great sob , and crossed her hands upon her breast , and in her way thanked God . She had had no thought that she could be thus near to it . She asked no more , but set straight on her way thither . It looked quite close . She had exhausted the scanty strength which she owned in her first flight ; she could go but slowly ; and the roads were heavy across the ploughed lands , and through the edges of the woods . She walked on and on till it grew dusk , then she asked of a woman weeding in a field how far it might be yet to Paris . The woman told her four leagues and more . She grew deadly cold with fear . She was weak , and she had no hope that she could reach it before dawn ; and she had nothing with which to buy shelter for the night . She could see it still ; a cloud , now as of fireflies , upon the purple and black of the night ; and in a passionate agony of longing she once more bent her limbs and ran — thinking of him . To her the city of the world , the city of the kings , the city of the eagles , was only of value for the sake of this one life it held . It was useless . All the strength she possessed was already spent . The feebleness of fever still sang in her ears and trembled in her blood . She was sick and faint , and very thirsty . She struck timidly at a little cottage door , and asked to rest the night there . The woman glanced at her and slammed‐to the door . At another and yet another she tried ; but at neither had she any welcome ; they muttered of the hospitals and drove her onward . Finally , tired out , she dropped down on the curled hollow of an old oak stump that stood by the wayside , and fell asleep , seeing to the last through her sinking lids that cloud of light where the great city lay . The night was cold ; the earth damp ; it was far on into night ; she stretched her limbs out wearily and sighed , and dreamed that Thanatos touched her with his asphodels , and whispered , “
187816	188166	188222	188223	A‐h‐h‐. Women	4148	” WHEN she awoke she was no longer in the open air by the roadside , with the grey of the falling night about her , and the wet leaves for her bed . She was in a white painted chamber , sweet with many roses , hung with deep hues of violet , filled with gold and colour and sculpture and bronze , duskily beautiful and dimly lighted by a great wood fire that glowed upon andirons of brass . On the wall nearest her hung all alone a picture,—a picture of a girl asleep in a scarlet blaze of poppies , above her head a purple butterfly , and on her breast the Red Mouse of the Brocken . Opposite to it beside the hearth , watching her with his small brilliant eyes , and quite motionless , sat the old man Sartorian , who had kept his faith with her , though the gods had not kept theirs . And the picture and the reality grew confused before her , and she knew not which was herself and which her painted likeness , nor which was the little red mouse that gibbered among the red flowers , and which the little old man who sat watching her with the fire gleams bright in his eyes ; and it seemed to her that she and the picture were one , and he and the mouse were one likewise ; and she moaned and leaned her head on her hands and tried to think . The heat of the chamber and the strong nourishment which they had poured down her throat when she was insensible of anything they did to her , had revived the life in her . Memory and sense returned slowly to her ; what first awakened her was her one passionate desire , so intense that it became an instinct stifling every other , to go on her way to the city that had flashed in its golden glory on her sight one moment , only the next to disappear into the eternal night . “
188169	188185	188222	188223	A‐h‐h‐. Women	4148	” she muttered mechanically , as she lifted her face with a hopeless bewildered prayer . “
188193	188221	188222	188223	A‐h‐h‐. Women	4148	” she muttered instinctively , and she tried to rise and walk , not well knowing what she did . The old man laughed a little silently . “
188243	188263	188231	188231	their	4148	” At the sound of his voice her eyes opened wide upon him ; she knew his face again . “
188268	188280	188266	188266	I	0	” she asked him with a sharp terror in her voice . “
188285	188290	188266	188266	I	0	” he said simply . “
188348	188349	188341	188341	You	0	” “
188354	188378	188352	188352	Rioz	77	” She could not comprehend , a horror seized her lest she should have strayed from Paris back into her mother ’s province . “
188403	188417	188428	188428	handsomer,—almost	4154	” She shuddered and turned paler with the memory of that ghastly prison‐house . “
188466	188487	188461	188461	You	0	” She could not answer ; she only stared at him blankly , with sad , mindless , dilated eyes . “
188492	188496	188461	188461	You	0	” she muttered ; “
188501	189254	188461	188461	You	0	” He looked at her awhile , then rose and went and sent his handwomen , who took her to an inner chamber , and bathed and attended her with assiduous care ; she was stupefied and knew not what they did . They served her tenderly . They bathed her tired limbs and laid her as gently as though she were some wounded royal captive upon a couch of down . She had no force to resist . Her eyes were heavy , and her senses were obscured . The potence of the draught which they had forced through her lips , when she had been insensible , acted on her as an anodyne . She sank back unconsciously , and she slept again , all through the night and half the day that followed . Through all the hours she was conscious at intervals of the fragrance of flowers , of the gleams of silver and gold , of the sounds of distant music , of the white calm gaze of marble fauns and dryads , who looked on her from amidst the coolness of hanging foilage . She who had never rested on any softer couch than her truss of hay or heap of bracken , dreamed that she slept on roses . The fragrance of innumerable flowers breathed all around her . A distant music came through the silence on her drowsy ear . For the first time in her life of toil and pain she knew how exquisite a pleasure mere repose can be . At noon she awoke , crying aloud that the Red Mouse claimed her soul from Thanatos . When her vision cleared , and her dream passed away , the music , the flowers , the colour , the coolness , were all real around her . She was lying on a couch as soft as the rose‐beds of Sybaris . About her were the luxuries and the graces amidst which the rich dwell . Above her head , from a golden height , a painted Eros smiled . The light , on to which her startled eyes opened , came to her veiled through soft , rosy hues ; the blossom of flowers met her everywhere , glided lattices and precious stones , and countless things for which she knew neither the name nor use , and wondrous plants , with birds like living blossoms on the wing above them , and the marble heads of women , rising cold and pure above the dreamy shadows — all the colour , and the charm , and the silence , and the grace of the life that is rounded by wealth was around her . She lay silent and breathless awhile , with wide open eyes , motionless from the languor of her weakness and the confusion of her thoughts , wondering dully , whether she belonged to the hosts of the living or the dead . She was in a small sleeping chamber , in a bed like the cup of a lotus ; there was perfect silence round her , except for the faint far‐off echo of some music ; a drowsy subtle fragrance filled the air , the solemn measure of a clock ’s pendulum deepened the sense of stillness ; for the first time in her life she learned how voluptuous a thing the enjoyment of simple rest can be . All her senses were steeped in it , lulled by it , magnetised by it ; and , so far as every thought was conscious to her , she thought that this was death — death amidst the fields of asphodel , and in the eternal peace of the realm of Thanatos . Suddenly her eyes fell on a familiar thing , a little picture close at hand , the picture of herself amidst the poppies . She leapt from the bed , and fell before it , and clasped it in her arms , and wept over it and kissed it , because it had been the work of his hand , and prayed to the unknown gods to make her suffer all things in his stead , and to give him the desire of his soul . And the Red Mouse had no power on her , because of her great love . She arose from that prayer with her mind clear , and her nerves strung ; she remembered all that had chanced to her . “
189260	189271	188461	188461	You	0	” she muttered to the serving‐women who watched beside her . “
189281	189543	189544	189544	You	4158	” They craved her to wear the costly and broidered stuffs strewn about her ; masterpieces of many an eastern and southern loom ; but she put them all aside in derision and impatience , drawing around her with a proud loving action the folds of her own poor garments . Weather‐stained , torn by bush and briar , soaked with night dew , and discoloured by the dye of many a crushed flower and bruised berry of the fields and woods , she yet would not have exchanged these poor shreds of woven flax and goats ’ wool against imperial roves , for poor though they were , they were the symbols of her independence and her liberty . The women tended her gently , and pressed on her many rare and fair things , but she would not have them ; she took a cup of milk , and passed out into the larger chamber . She was troubled and bewildered , but she had no fear ; for she was too innocent , too wearied , and too desperate with that deathless courage , which having borne the worst that fate can do , can know no dread . She stood with her arms folded on her breast , drawing together the tattered folds of the tunic , gazing at the luxury , and the blended colour of the room . So softly , that she never heard his footfall , the old man entered behind her , and came to the hearth , and looked on her . “
189548	189552	189544	189544	You	4158	” he asked . “
189559	189641	189554	189554	you	4158	” She looked up , and met the eyes of Sartorian . They smiled again on her with the smile of the Red Mouse . The one passion which consumed her was stronger than any fear or any other memory : she only though — this man must know ? She sprang forward and grasped his arm with both hands , with the seizure of a tigress ; her passionate eyes searched his face ; her voice came hard and fast . “
189653	189659	189660	189660	I	0	” His eyes still smiled : “
189694	189706	189707	189707	You	4158	” She shuddered , and her hands dropped from their hold . “
189711	189715	189707	189707	You	4158	” she murmured . “
189742	189826	189737	189737	you	4158	” And he laughed his little soft laugh . The eagle often soared so high — so high — that the icy vapours of the empyrean froze them dead , and they dropped to earth a mere , bruised , helpless , useless mass:—he knew . She stood stunned and confused : her horror of Sartorian was struggling into life through the haze in which all things of the past were still shrouded to her dulled remembrance — all things save her love . “
189830	189836	189737	189737	you	4158	” he said , gently . “
189867	189877	189858	189858	I	0	” Her eyes glanced round her on every side . “
189882	189886	189858	189858	I	0	” she muttered . “
189898	189899	189893	189893	You	4158	” “
189904	189905	189900	189900	I	0	” “
189913	190053	190055	190055	you	4165	” She rested where he motioned ; he looked at her in smiling wonder . She leaned on one of the cushioned couches , calm , motionless , negligent , giving no sign that she saw the chamber round her to be any other than the wooden barn or thatched cattle‐sheds of the old mill‐house ; her feet were crossed , her limbs were folded in that exquisite repose which is inborn in races of the East ; the warmth of the room , and the long hours of sleep had brought the natural bloom to her face , the natural lustre to her eyes , which earlier fatigue and long illness had banished . He surveyed her with that smile which she had resented on the day when she had besought pity of him for Arslàn ’s sake . “
190059	190065	190055	190055	you	4165	” was all he said . “
190069	190089	190055	190055	you	4165	” He laughed his low humorous laugh that displeased her so bitterly , though it was soft of tone . “
190108	190109	190113	190113	mine	4165	” “
190115	190116	190113	190113	mine	4165	” “
190142	190143	190138	190138	she	4166	” “
190150	190151	190138	190138	she	4166	” “
190177	190187	190170	190170	yours	4167	” She looked at him with dreaming perplexed eyes . “
190195	190201	190190	190190	you	4165	” she said , suddenly . “
190222	190279	190207	190208	All men	5168	” She laughed a little ; with the warmth , the rest , the wonder , the vague sense of some unknown danger , her old skill and courage rose . She knew that she had promised to be grateful always to this man ; otherwise,—oh , God!—how she could have hated him , she thought ! “
190282	190286	190207	190208	All men	5168	” she answered , “
190374	190515	190516	190516	You	4165	” He looked at her with a curious wonder and admiration ; he was angered , humbled , incensed , and allured , and yet he was glad ; she looked so handsome thus with the curl on her quiet lips , and her spirited head fit for a bronze cast of Atalanta . He was an old man ; he could bear to pause and rightly appreciate the charm of scorn , the spur of irony , the goad of hatred . He knew the full value of its sharp spears to the wonder‐blooming aloe . He left the subject for a happier moment , and seating himself , opened his hands to warm them by the wood fire , still watching her with that smile , which for its very indulgence , its very banter , she abhorred . “
190524	190555	190556	190556	He	4172	” he asked carelessly . He saw her whole face change as with a blow , and her body bend within itself as a young tree bends under a storm . “
190565	190572	190556	190556	He	4172	” she said below her breath . “
190585	190599	190578	190578	You	4165	” he said , with the little low laugh still in his throat . “
190654	190655	190656	190656	I	0	” “
190661	190672	190656	190656	I	0	” she said , with fierce effort stifling her misery . “
190689	190690	190684	190684	I	0	” “
190905	190906	190894	190894	you	4165	” “
190918	190938	190910	190910	He	4172	” He looked at her keenly . He could measure the superb force of this unblenching and mute courage . “
191018	191122	191001	191001	women	365	” She took them ; old oriental jewels lying loose in an agate cup on a table near ; there were amongst them three great sapphires , which in their way were priceless , from their rare size and their perfect colour . Her mouth laughed with its old scorn . She , who had lost life , soul , earth , heaven , to be consoled with the glass beads of a bauble ! This man seemed to her more foolish than any creature that had ever spoken on her ear . She looked , then laid them — indifferently — down . “
191144	191152	191001	191001	women	365	” He moved them away , chagrined . “
191160	191165	191155	191155	you	4185	” he asked drily . “
191173	191188	191155	191155	you	4185	” she answered with the fatalism and composure that ran in her eastern blood . “
191205	191281	191198	191198	you	0	” She told him , briefly ; she wanted to hide that she had suffered aught , or had been in any measure coldly dealt with , and she spoke with the old force of a happier time , seeking rather to show how well it was with her that she should thus be free , and have no law save her own will , and knew that none lived who could say to her , “
191285	191287	191198	191198	you	0	” or “
191291	191362	191198	191198	you	0	” Almost she duped him , she was so brave . Not quite . His eyes had read the souls and senses of women for half a century ; and none had ever deceived him . As he listened to her he knew well that under her desolation and her solitude her heart was broken — though not her courage . But he accepted her words as she spoke them . “
191374	191380	191364	191364	you	4187	” he said to her . “
191416	191417	191384	191384	you	4187	” “
191436	191453	191384	191384	you	4187	” she said with the curt and caustic meaning that had first allured him in her . “
191462	191517	191384	191384	you	4187	” he added with as subtle a significance . She shuddered a little ; no female creature that is beautiful and vigorous and young can coldly brook to look straight at the doom of age ; death is far less appalling , because death is uncertain , mystical , and may still have beauty . “
191527	191531	191520	191520	you	4187	” he pursued . “
191551	191616	191544	191545	the poor	5743	” She spoke calmly , leaning down on one of the cushioned benches by the hearth , resting her chin on her hand ; her brown slender feet were crossed one over another , her eye‐lids were heavy from weakness and the warmth of the room ; the soft dim light played on her tenderly ; he looked at her with a musing smile . “
191625	191642	191544	191545	the poor	5743	” he said , slowly spreading out the delicate palms of his hands to the fire ; “
191650	191651	191644	191644	you	4187	” “
191655	191718	191644	191644	you	4187	” she gave a quick gesture of her head , tired , insolent , indifferent ; and a terrible darkness stole over her face ; what matter how beautiful she might be , she had no beauty in her own sight , for the eyes of Arslàn had dwelt on her , cold , calm , unmoved , whilst he had said , “
191728	191729	191719	191719	I	0	” “
191735	191740	191730	191730	You	4187	” Sartorian said drily . “
191763	191789	191790	191792	No beautiful woman	4197	” She rose and stood before him in the rosy glow of the fire that bathed her limbs until they glowed like jade and porphyry . “
191810	191825	191806	191806	I	0	” He smiled , holding his delicate palms to the warmth of his hearth . “
191881	191882	191844	191844	Jerusalem	70	” “
191886	191887	191844	191844	Jerusalem	70	” “
191894	191895	191897	191897	they	4207	” “
191900	191901	191897	191897	they	4207	” “
191910	191911	191897	191897	they	4207	” “
191915	191916	191897	191897	they	4207	” “
191932	191933	191934	191934	You	4187	” “
191943	191944	191934	191934	You	4187	” “
191959	192032	191934	191934	You	4187	” Her face burned ; she hung her head instinctively . She sank down again on the seat which she had quitted . The old horror of shame which she had felt by the water side under the orchards bent her strength under this man ’s unmerciful passion . She knew that he had her secret , and the haughty passion and courage of her nature writhed under his taunt of it . “
192040	192046	192047	192047	I	0	” he said to her . “
192054	192055	192047	192047	I	0	” “
192061	192062	192063	192063	I	0	” “
192069	192070	192063	192063	I	0	” “
192119	192120	192121	192121	You	0	” “
192132	192133	192121	192121	You	0	” “
192179	192186	192157	192157	you	4187	” She touched the three sapphires . “
192215	192216	192196	192196	I	0	” “
192267	192313	192264	192265	the poor	5743	” he added , carelessly , resting his keen far‐reaching eyes upon her . Despite herself she shuddered ; he recalled to her that the world was close at hand — the world in which she would be houseless , friendless , penniless , alone . “
192327	192333	192335	192335	you	4187	” he repeated , musingly . “
192376	192377	192359	192359	you	4187	” “
192382	192398	192400	192400	you	0	” her voice suddenly gathered strength and scorn , and rang loud on the stillness . “
192481	192541	192479	192479	you	4187	” He did not answer her ; he was absorbed in his study of her face ; he was thinking how she would look in Paris in some theatre ’s spectacle of Egypt , with anclets of dull gold and a cymar of dead white , and behind her a sea of palms and a red and sullen sky . “
192550	192570	192479	192479	you	4187	” he thought , as his eyes went from her to the study of her sleeping in the poppies . “
192584	192585	192575	192575	he	4935	” “
192591	192596	192586	192586	You	4218	” he said aloud . “
192652	192653	192645	192645	You	4218	” “
192669	192670	192677	192677	your	4218	” “
192685	192686	192677	192677	your	4218	” “
192713	192714	192677	192677	your	4218	” “
192745	192746	193155	193155	she	4222	” “
192749	193135	193155	193155	she	4222	” she could not deride this god , for she knew it was the greatest of them all ; when the rod of riches had been lost , had not the Far‐Striking King himself been brought low and bound down to a slave ’s drudgery ? The small , keen , elfin , satiric face bent on her did not change from its musing study , its slow vigilant smile ; holding her under the subtle influence of his gaze , Sartorian began to speak,—speak as he could at choice , with accents sweet as silver , slow words persuasive as sorcery . With the terse , dainty , facile touches of a master , he placed before her that world of which she knew no more than any one of the reeds that blew by the sands of the river . He painted to her that life of all others , which was in most vital contrast and unlikeliness to her own ; the life of luxury , of indolence , of carelessness , of sovereignty , of endless pleasure , and supreme delight ; he painted to her the years of a woman rich , caressed , omnipotent , beautiful , supreme , with all the world before her from which to choose her lovers , her playthings , her triumphs , her victories , her cruelties , and her seductions . He painted the long cloudless invigorating day of such a favourite of fortune , with its hours winged by love and its laughter rhymed to music , and its wishes set to gold ; the same day for the same woman , whether it were called of Rome or of Corinth , of Byzantium or of Athens , of Babylon or of Paris , and whether she herself were hailed hetaira or imperatrix . He drew such things as the skill of his words and the deep knowledge of his many years enabled him , in language which aroused her even from the absorption of her wretchedness , and stirred her dull disordered thoughts to a movement of restless discontent , and of strange wonder — Arslàn had never spoken to her thus . He let his words dwell silently on her mind , awhile : then suddenly he asked her , “
193146	193148	193151	193151	she	4222	” She thought—“envy
193167	193168	193151	193151	she	4222	” “
193174	193179	193151	193151	she	4222	” she said aloud ; “
193198	193199	193183	193183	I	0	” “
193218	193226	193208	193208	you	172	” She flashed her eyes upon him . “
193232	193233	193208	193208	you	172	” “
193247	193248	193245	193245	Folle‐Farine	104	” “
193253	193254	193245	193245	Folle‐Farine	104	” “
193269	193270	193245	193245	Folle‐Farine	104	” “
193274	193275	193245	193245	Folle‐Farine	104	” “
193292	193293	193245	193245	Folle‐Farine	104	” “
193297	193298	193245	193245	Folle‐Farine	104	” “
193309	193310	193299	193299	You	172	” “
193313	193314	193299	193299	You	172	” “
193347	193348	193349	193349	I	0	” “
193355	193433	193349	193349	I	0	” For a moment he was silent . The simple , pathetic acceptance of the fate that made her name — merely because hers — a symbol of all things despised , and desolate , and forsaken , touched his heart and moved him to a sorrowful pity . But the pity died , and the cruelty remained alive behind it . He bent on her the magnetic power of his bright , sardonic , meaning eyes . “
193527	193570	193571	193571	I	0	” Her breath came and went as she listened : the blood in her face flushed and paled ; she trembled violently , and her whole frame seemed to dilate and strengthen and vibrate with the electric force of that subtlest temptation . “
193573	193578	193581	193581	you	4238	” she murmured brokenly . “
193608	193664	193665	193665	thou	4239	” The wondrous promise swept her fancy for the moment on the strong current of its imagery , as a river sweeps a leaf . This empire hers?—hers?—when all mankind had driven and derided her and shunned her sight and touch , and cursed and flouted her , and barely thought her worthy to be called “
193668	193685	193665	193665	thou	4239	” He looked at her and smiled , and bent towards the warmth of the fire . “
193707	193771	193705	193705	Folle‐Farine	104	” The light on her face faded ; a sudden apprehension tightened at her heart ; on her face gathered the old fierce deadly antagonism which constant insult and attack had taught her to assume on the first instant of menace as her only buckler . She knew not what evil threatened ; but vaguely she felt that treason was close about her . “
193779	193784	193773	193773	you	0	” she said slowly , “
193799	193800	193792	193792	you	0	” “
193821	193907	193801	193801	I	0	” The darkness and the perplexed trouble deepened on her face ; she rose and stood and looked at him , her teeth shut together with a quick sharp ring , her straight proud brows drew together in stormy silence ; all the tigress in her was awoke and rising ready to spring ; yet amidst that dusky passion , that withering scorn of doubt , there was an innocent pathetic wonder , a vague desolation and disappointment , that were childlike and infinitely sad . “
193917	193922	193913	193913	you	0	” she said bitterly . “
193931	193932	193913	193913	you	0	” “
193942	194036	194037	194037	I	0	” And he laughed his little low laugh in his throat . Then , and then only , she understood him . With a sudden unconscious instinctive action her hand sought her knife , but the girdle was empty ; she sprang erect , her face on fire with a superb fury , her eyes blazing , like the eyes of a wild beast ’s by night , a magnificence of scorn and rage upon her quivering features . Her voice rang clear and hard and cold as ring the blows of steel . “
194094	194154	194155	194155	She	4245	” He watched her with a musing smile , a dreamy calm content ; all this tempest of her scorn , all this bitterness of her disdain , all this whirlwind of her passion and her suffering , seemed but to beguile him more and make him surer of her beauty , of her splendour , of her strength . “
194167	194195	194155	194155	She	4245	” he thought , as he drooped his head and watched her through his half‐closed eyelids , as the Red Mouse watched the sleeper in the poppies . “
194200	194207	194208	194208	you	4245	” he said with that slow ironic smile—“let
194220	194221	194218	194218	Folle‐Farine	104	” “
194237	194245	194257	194257	Folle‐Farine	104	” He laughed in his throat again . “
194337	194338	194326	194326	I	0	” “
194343	194351	194326	194326	I	0	” she cried , across his words . “
194371	194372	194374	194374	me	0	” “
194377	194378	194374	194374	me	0	” “
194453	194454	194459	194459	I	0	” “
194462	194463	194459	194459	I	0	” “
194519	194520	194733	194733	her	1187	” “
194525	194707	194733	194733	her	1187	” She stood at bay before him , pale in her scorn of rage , her right hand clenched against her breast , her eyes breathing fire , her whole attitude instinct with the tempest of contempt and loathing , which she held down thus , passive and almost wordless , because she once had promised never to be thankless to this man . He gazed at her and smiled , and thought how beautiful that chained whirlwind of her passions looked ; but he did not touch her nor even go nearer to her . There was a dangerous gleam in her eyes that daunted him . Moreover he was patient , humorous , gentle , cruel , wise — all in one ; and he desired to tame and to beguile her , and to see her slowly drawn into the subtle sweetness of the powers of gold ; and to enjoy the yielding of each moral weakness one by one , as the southern boy slowly pulls limb from limb , wing from wing , of the cicada . “
194716	194726	194708	194708	I	0	” he said , with his low grim laugh . “
194753	194754	194744	194744	You	4253	” “
194757	194758	194744	194744	You	4253	” “
194767	194768	194759	194759	You	4253	” “
194778	194779	194780	194780	You	4253	” “
194789	194790	194780	194780	You	4253	” “
194797	194798	194780	194780	You	4253	” “
194803	194804	194780	194780	You	4253	” “
194810	194811	194780	194780	You	4253	” “
194822	194823	194824	194824	Their	4256	” “
194832	194833	194834	194834	You	4253	” “
194846	194847	194843	194844	an outcast	5498	” “
194852	194853	194843	194844	an outcast	5498	” “
194862	194863	194854	194854	You	4253	” “
194872	194873	194874	194874	You	4253	” “
194915	194938	194939	194939	I	0	” For the first time she quailed as though struck by a sharp blow ; but her voice remained inflexible and serene . “
194961	194962	194963	194963	I	0	” “
194969	194981	194963	194963	I	0	” he said slowly , as he moved a little away . “
195083	195548	195079	195079	woman	339	” Ere she knew his intent he had moved the panel and drawn it behind him , and left her alone,—shut in a trap like the birds that Claudis Flamma had netted in his orchards . That night , when the night without was quite dark , she knelt down before the study of the poppies , and kissed it softly , and prayed to the unknown God , of whom none had taught her in anywise , yet whose light she still had found , and followed in a dim wondering imperfect fashion , as a little child lost in the twilight of some pathless wood , pursues in trembling the gleam of some great still planet looming far above her through the leaves . When she arose from her supplication , her choice was already made . And the Red Mouse had no power on her , because of her great love . AT sunrise a great peacock trailing his imperial purple on the edge of a smooth lawn , pecked angrily at a torn fragment of a scarlet scarf ; a scarf that had been woven in his own eastern lands , but which incensed his sight , fluttering there so idly , as it seemed , on the feathery sprays of a little low almond tree that grew by the water ’s edge . The water was broad , and full of lily leaves and of rare reeds and rushes ; it had been so stemmed and turned by art that it washed the basement walls and mirrored the graceful galleries and arches of the garden palace , where the birds of Hêrê dwelt . Twenty feet above the level of the gardens , where the peacock swept in the light , there was an open casement , a narrow balcony of stone ; a group of pale human faces looking out awe‐stricken . A leap in the night — the night wet and moonless,—waters a fathom deep,—a bed of sand treacherous and shifting as the ways of love . What could all these be save certain death ? Of death they were afraid ; but they were more afraid yet of the vengeance of their flute‐voiced lord . On the wall the Red Mouse sat amongst the flowers of sleep ; he could have told ; he who for once had heard another prayer than the blasphemies of the Brocken . But the Red Mouse never tells any secret to men ; he has lived too long in the breast of the women whom men love . The sun came from the east , and passed through the pale stricken faces that watched from the casement , and came straight to where the Red Mouse sat amidst the poppies . “
195558	195568	195079	195079	woman	339	” said the Sun . The Red Mouse answered : “
195623	195628	195638	195639	the Moon	248	” Said the Sun , “
195653	195654	195635	195636	My sister	6711	” “
195658	195672	195635	195636	My sister	6711	” said the Red Mouse . The Sun , wondering , said again : “
195707	195713	195722	195722	man	4882	” The Red Mouse answered : “
195725	196361	195722	195722	man	4882	” IN the dark of night she had leapt to what , as she thought , would prove her grave ; but the waters with human‐like caprice had cast her back upon the land with scarce an effort of her own . Given back thus to life , whether she would or no , she by sheer instinct stumbled to her feet and fled as fast as she could in the wet gloomy night through the grassy stretches of the unknown gardens and lands in which she found herself . She was weighted with her soaked clothes as with lead , but she was made swift by terror and hatred , as though Hermes for once had had pity for anything human , and had fastened to her feet his own winged sandals . She ran on and on , not knowing whither ; only knowing that she ran from the man who had tempted her by the strength of the rod of wealth . The rains were ceaseless , the skies had no stars , in the dense mist no lights , far or near , of city or planets , of palace or house , were seen . She did not know where she went ; she only ran on away and away , anywhere , from the Red Mouse and its master . When the daybreak grew grey in the heavens , she paused , and trembling crept into a cattle shed to rest and take breath a little . She shrank from every habitation , she quivered at every human voice ; she was afraid — horribly afraid — in those clinging vapours , those damp deathly smells , those ghostly shadows of the dawn , those indistinct and unfamiliar creatures of a country strange to her . That old man with the elf ’s eyes , who had tempted her , was he a god too , she wondered , since he had the rod that metes power and wealth ? He might stretch his hand anywhere , she supposed , and take her . The gentle cattle in their wooden home made way for her , and humbly welcomed her . She hid herself amongst their beds of hay , and in the warmth of their breath and their bodies . She was wet and wretched , like any half drowned dog ; but the habits of her hardy life made cold and hunger and exposure almost powerless to harm her . She slept from sheer exhaustion of mind and body . The cattle could have trodden her to death , or tossed her through the open spaces of their byres , but they seemed to know , they seemed to pity ; and they stirred so that they did not brush a limb of her , nor shorten a moment of her slumbers . When she awoke the sun was high . A herdswoman , entering with the loud harsh clash of brazen pails , kicked her in the loins , and rated her furiously for daring to rest there . She arose at the kick , and went out from the place passively , not well knowing what she did . The morning was warm and radiant ; the earth and the trees were dripping with the rains of the night ; the air was full of sweet odours , and of a delicious coldness . As far as she saw there was no token far or near of the gleaming cloud of the city of her dreams . She ventured to ask at a wayside cabin is she were near or far to Paris ? The woman of the cottage looked up searchingly from the seat before the porch , and for answer cried to her : “
196373	196773	196369	196369	you	4268	” She had lost for the time the mental force , and even the physical force , to resent or to persevere ; she was weak with hunger and bewildered with her misery . She had only sense enough left to remember — and be thankful — that in the night that was past she had been strong . The sun beat on her head , the road was hard , and sharp set with flint ; she was full of pain , her brain throbbed with fever and reeled with weakness ; a sudden horror seized her lest she might die before she had looked again on the face of Arslàn . She saw the dusky shade of a green wood ; by sheer instinct she crept into it as a stricken deer into its sanctuary . She sat in the darkness of the trees in the coolness of the wood , and rested her head on her hands , and let the big salt tears drop one by one , as the death tears of the llama fall . This was the young year round her ; that she knew . The winter had gone by ; its many months had passed over her head whilst she was senseless to any flight of night or day ; death might have taken the prey which it had once been robbed of by her ; in all this weary season , which to her was as a blank , his old foes of failure and famine might have struggled for and vanquished him , she not being by ; his body might lie in any plague‐ditch of the blameless poor , his hand might rot fleshless and nerveless in any pit where the world cast its useless and dishonoured dead ; the mould of his brain might make a feast for eyeless worms , not more stone blind that was the human race he had essayed to serve ; the beauty of his face might be a thing of loathsomeness from which a toad would turn . Oh , God ! would death never take her likewise ? Was she an outcast even from that one tribeless and uncounted nation of the dead ? That God whom she had loved , whom she had chosen , whose eyes had been so full of pity , whose voice had murmured : “
196784	196962	196968	196968	He	4271	friend”:—even he , Thanatos , had turned against her and abandoned her . Vague memories of things which she had heard in fable and tradition , of bodies accursed and condemned to wander for ever unresting and wailing of spirits , which for their curse were imprisoned in a living flesh that they could neither lose nor cast away so long as the world itself endured ; creatures that the very elements had denied , and that were too vile for fire to burn , or water to drown , or steel to slay , or old age to wither , or death to touch and take in any wise . All these memories returned to her , and in her loneliness she wondered if she were such an one as these . She did not know , indeed , that she had done any great sin ; she had done none willingly , and yet all people called her vile , and they must know ? Even the old man , mocking her , had said : “
197023	197375	197005	197005	you	4272	” And she had not chosen ; yet of any nobility in the resistance she did not dream . She had shut her heart to it by the unconscious instinct of strength , as she had shut her lips under torture , and shut her hand against gold . She sat there in the wood , roofless , penniless , friendless , and every human creature was against her . Her temper had spoken only the bare and bleak truth . A dog stoned and chased and mad could be the only living thing on the face of the earth more wretched and more desolate than herself . The sun of noon was bright above head in a cloudless sky , but in the little wood it was cool and shady , and had the moisture of a heavy morning dew . Millions of young leaves had uncurled themselves in the warmth . Little butterflies , some azure , some yellow , some white , danced in the light . Brown rills of water murmured under the grasses , the thrushes sang to one another through the boughs , and the lizard darted hither and thither , green as the arrowy leaves that made its shelter . A little distance from her there was a group of joyous singers who looked at her from time to time , their laughter hushing a little , and their simple carousal under the green boughs broken by a nameless chilliness and involuntary speculation . She did not note them , her face being bowed down upon her hands , and no sound of the thrushes ’ song or of the human singers ’ voices rousing her from the stupefaction of despair which drugged her senses . They watched her long ; her attitude did not change . One of them at length rose up and went hesitating a step or two forwards ; a girl with twinkling feet , clad gaily in bright colours , though the texture of her clothes was poor . She went and touched the crouched sad figure , softly . “
197381	197394	197377	197377	you	4273	” The figure lifted its bowed head , its dark hopeless eyes . “

197746	197766	197743	197743	they	4278	“ We too go to Paris . We are poor . We follow art . We will befriend you . ”

198020	198077	198078	198078	She	4273	“ I mean — will you share yourself with us ? We will give you no words . It will be quite easy . What money we make we divide amongst us . All you shall do shall be to stand and be looked at — you are beautiful and you know it , no doubt ? ”
198642	198648	198649	198649	she	4306	“ That is your art ? ”
198661	198674	198649	198649	she	4306	“ Well , is it not art ; and a noble one ? ”
198683	198713	198649	198649	she	4306	“ It is no art . It is human always . It is never divine . There is neither heaven nor hell in it . It is all earth . ”

198881	198888	198889	198889	she	4306	“ Have I begged from you ? ”
198892	198898	198889	198889	she	4306	“ I have earned nothing . ”

201886	201900	201901	201901	she	5264	“ Does that brazen scroll shade you better than did the trellised vine ? ”
201913	201934	201901	201901	she	5264	“ And are those stones in your breast any brighter than the blue was in the eyes of your child ? ”
202168	202178	202180	202181	the actors	4310	“ There are only two trades in a city , ”
202194	202222	202180	202181	the actors	4310	“ only two trades — to buy souls and to sell them . What business have you here , who do neither the one nor the other ? ”

204107	204162	204172	204174	the old man	335	her,—“Come , eat and drink , and sow your garments with gems , and kiss men on the mouth whilst you slay them , and plunder and poison , and laugh and be wise . For all your gods are dead ; and there is but one god now — that god is gold . ”
204163	204171	204172	204174	the old man	335	“ You must be tired , surely , ”
204181	204217	204218	204218	He	335	“ You never find what you seek ; you are always alone , always hungered and poor ; always wretched,—Folle‐Farine . Ah ! you would not eat my golden pear . It was not wise . ”
204261	204317	204243	204243	She	5264	“ You fled away from me that night . It was heroic , foolish , mad . Yet I bear no anger against it . You have not loved the old dead gods for nought . You have the temper of their times . You obey them ; though they betray you and forget you,—Folle‐Farine . ”
204338	204343	204344	204344	she	5264	“ Who told you ? ”
204347	204508	204344	204344	she	5264	“ Who told me , that you dwell here ? The sun has a million rays ; so has gold a million eyes ; do you not know ? There is nothing you have not done that has not been known to me . But I can always wait;—Folle‐Farine . You are very strong ; you are very weak , of course;—you have a faith ; and you follow it ; and it leads you on and on , on and on , and one day it will disappear — and you will plunge after it,—and it will drown you . You seek for this man and you can not find even his grave . You are like a woman who seeks for her lover on a battle‐fields . But the world is a carnage where the vultures soon pick bare the bones of the slain , and all skeletons look alike , and are most unlovely — Folle‐ Farine . ”
204509	204517	204518	204518	she	4506	“ You came — to say this ? ”
204526	204565	204518	204518	she	4506	“ Nay — I came to see your beauty , your ice‐god tired soon ; but I—. My golden pear would have been better vengeance for a slighted passion than this beggar ’s quarter , and these wretched rags—. ”
204583	204590	204591	204591	she	4506	“ There is no shame here , ”
204598	204620	204591	204591	she	4506	“ A beggar ’s quarters , perhaps ; but there poor copper coins and these rags I earn with clean hands . ”
204639	204763	204764	204764	Her	4506	“ No shame ? Oh , Folle‐Farine , did I not tell you , that , live as you may , shame will always be your garment in life and in death ? You — a thing beautiful , nameless , homeless , accursed , who dares to dream to be innocent likewise ! The world will clothe you with shame , whether you choose it or not . But the world , as I say , will give you one choice . Take its red robe boldly from it , and weight it with gold and encrust it with jewels . Believe me , the women who wear the white garments of virtue will envy you the red robe bitterly , then . ”
204801	204809	204772	204772	her	4506	“ You came — to say this ? ”
204810	204838	204839	204839	he	4508	“ Nay ; I came to see your beauty , Folle‐Farine . Your northern god soon tired , I say ; but I—. Look yonder a moment , ”
204885	205090	205091	205091	She	4513	“ See here , Folle‐Farine : you dwell with the lowest ; you are the slave of the street mobs ; no eyes see you except those of the harlot , the beggar , the thief , the outcast ; your wage is a crust and a copper coin ; you have the fate of your namesake , the dust , to wander a little while , and then sink on the stones of the streets . Yet that you think worthy and faithful , because it is pure , alike , of alms and of vice . Oh , beautiful fool ! what would your lost lover say if beholding you here , amidst the reek of the mob and the homage of thieves ? He would say of you the most bitter thing that a man can say of a woman : ‘ She has sunk into sin , but she has been powerless to gild her sin , or make it of more profit than her innocence . ’ And a man has no scorn like the scorn which he feels for a woman who sells her soul — at a loss . You see?—ah ! surely you see , Folle‐Farine ? ”
205239	205243	205252	205252	her	4513	“ You see ? ”
205257	205436	205437	205437	She	4517	“ You see ? You have all the shame : it is your birthright ; and you have nothing of the sweetness which may go with shame for a woman who has beauty . Now , look yonder . There lies the world , which when I saw you last was to you only an empty name . Now you know it — know it , at least , enough to be aware of all you have not , all you might have in it , if you took my golden pear . You must be tired , Folle‐Farine,—to stand homeless under the gilded balconies ; to be footsore in the summer dust amongst the rolling carriages ; to stand outcast and famished before the palace gates ; to see the smiles upon a million mouths , and on them all not one smile upon you ; to show yourself hourly amongst a mob , that you may buy a little bread to eat , a little straw to rest on ! You must be tired , Folle‐Farine ! ”
205493	205970	205971	205971	She	4519	“ You must be tired . Now , eat of my golden pear ; and there , where the world lies yonder at our feet , no name shall be on the mouths of men as your name shall be in a day . Through the crowds you shall be borne by horses fleet as the winds ; or you shall lean above them from a gilded gallery , and mock them at your fancy there on high in a cloud of flowers . Great jewels shall beam on you like planets ; and the only chains that you shall wear shall be links of gold , like the chains of a priestess of old . Your mere wish shall be as a sorcerer ’s wand , to bring you the thing of our idlest desire . You have been despised!—what vengeance sweeter than to see men grovel to win your glance , as the swine at the feet of Circe ? You have been scorned and accursed ! — what retribution fuller than for women to behold in you the sweetness and magnificence of shame , and through you , envy , and fall , and worship the Evil which begot you ? Has humanity been so fair a friend to you that you can hesitate to strike at its heart with such a vengeance — so symmetrical in justice , so cynical in irony ? Humanity cast you out to wither at your birth,—a thing rootless , nameless , only meet for the snake and the worm . If you bear poison in your fruit , is that your fault , or the fault of the human hands that cast the chance‐sown weed out on the dunghill to perish ? I do not speak of passion . I use no amorous phrase . I am old and ill‐favoured ; and I know that , any way , you will for ever hate me . But the rage of the desert‐beast is more beautiful than the meek submission of the animal timid and tame . It is the lioness in you that I care to chain ; but your chains shall be of gold , Folle‐Farine ; and all women will envy . Name your price , set it high as you will ; there is nothing that I will refuse . Nay , even I will find your lover , who loves not you ; and I will let you have your fullest vengeance on him . A noble vengeance , for no other would be worthy of your strength . Living or dead , his genius shall be made known to men ; and , before another summer comes , all the world shall toss aloft in triumph the name that is now nothing as the dust is;—nothing as you are , Folle‐Farine ! ”
206092	206098	206099	206099	she	4519	“ What do I say ? ”
206104	206152	206099	206099	she	4519	“ What ? Well , this : I could seize you , and cast you down into the dark below there , as easily as I cast that tuft of weed . And why I hold my hand I can not tell ; it would be just . ”
206350	206390	206391	206391	she	4519	“ To wear soft stuffs and rich colours , to have jewels in their breasts , to sleep in satin , to hear fools laugh , to have both hands full of gold , that is what women love , ”
206532	206544	206545	206547	the Red Mouse	211	“ You will tire , and I can wait , Folle‐Farine , ”
206887	206896	206898	206898	she	4519	“ Are you not tired yet , Folle‐Farine ? ”
207378	207402	207348	207348	She	4519	“ Dost thou dare to be strong , thou ? a grain of dust , a reed of the river , a Nothing ? ”
207495	207501	207502	207502	She	4519	“ When you are tired,—Folle‐Farine ? ”
207554	207560	207561	207561	she	4519	“ Are you not tired ? ”
207569	207577	207561	207561	she	4519	“ Are you not tired , Folle‐Farine ? ”
207578	207587	207588	207588	she	4519	“ If I be , what of that ? ”
207669	207681	207688	207705	a serving‐girl , young , with sallow cheeks , and a hollow voice , and eyes of fever	4552	“ If I had only your face , and your chances , ”
207718	207739	207741	207764	a dancing‐woman with sullen eyes and a yellow skin from the hither side of the mountains , who begged in the streets all day	4553	“ Are you mad that you hunger here when you might hang yourself with diamonds like our Lady of Atocha ? ”
207861	207875	207852	207852	they	4557	“ Strength in the dust — in a reed — in a Nothing ? ”
208138	208145	208146	208146	she	4564	“ Why do they not die ? ”
208720	208726	208727	208727	he	221	“ Do you shrink still ? ”
208732	208791	208727	208727	he	221	“ Put back your knife ; look at me quietly ; you will not have the casket?—very well . Your strength is folly ; yet it is noble . It becomes you . I do you good for ill . I have had search made for your lover , who loves not you . I have found him . ”
208792	208795	208796	208796	She	4564	“ Living ? ”
208854	208857	208858	208858	he	172	“ Living , ”
208867	208887	208864	208864	he	172	“ Living . Come with me , and see how he has used the liberty you gave . Come . ”
208927	208933	208934	208934	she	4564	“ Is it the truth ? ”
208937	208947	208934	208934	she	4564	“ If you mock me — if you lie — ”
208948	209013	209020	209020	Sartorian	221	“ Your knife will sheathe itself in my body , I know . Nay , I have never lied to you . One can not wear a velvet glove to tame a lioness . Come with me ; fear nothing , Folle‐Farine . Come with me , and see with your own eye‐sight how the world of men has dealt with this your god . ”
209014	209019	209020	209020	Sartorian	221	“ I will come . ”
209027	209086	209020	209020	Sartorian	221	“ You are a barbarian ; and so you are heroic always . I would not lie to you , and here I have no need . Come ; it is very near to you . A rood of stone can sever two lives , though the strength of all the world can not unite them . Come . ”
209304	209335	209296	209296	Sartorian	221	“ If you find him in a woman ’s arms — lost in a sloth of passion — what then ? Will you stay still , let him have greatness ? ”
209368	209375	209376	209376	she	4564	“ What is that to you ? ”
209384	209410	209376	209376	she	4564	“ Show me the truth : as for him — he has a right to do as he will . Have I said ever otherwise ? ”
209557	209561	209562	209562	he	221	“ Wait here , ”
211271	211281	211282	211282	he	172	“ I will find a name or a grave , ”
211543	211550	211551	211551	he	172	“ Another day — another day ! ”
211928	212022	211912	211912	her	111	“ A deathless name?—Oh , madman . A little breath on the mouths of men in all the ages to come?—Oh , fool ! Hereafter , you cry ? — oh , fool!—heaven and earth may pass away , like a scroll that is burnt into ashes , and the future you live for may never come — neither for you nor the world . What you may gain — who shall say ? But all you have missed , I know . And no man shall scorn me — and pass unscathed . ”
212044	212049	212050	212050	she	4671	“ You look yonder , ”
212064	212072	212050	212050	she	4671	“ Are you anything to that man ? ”
212078	212084	212086	212087	the cripple	2584	“ He has no friends , ”
212089	212165	212086	212087	the cripple	2584	“ No human being has ever come to him ; and he has been here many months . He will be mad — very soon . I have seen it before . Those men do not die . Their bodies are too strong . But their brains go,—look you . And their brains go , and yet they live — to fourscore and ten many a time — shut up and manacled like wild beasts . ”
212200	212380	212183	212184	The crone	4674	“ I have watched him often ; he is fair to look at — one is never too old to care for that . All winter , spring , and summer he has lived so hard:—so cold too and so silent — painting that strange thing yonder . He looks like a king — he lives like a beggar . The picture was his god,—see you . And no doubt he has set his soul on fame — men will . All the world is mad . One day in the spring time it was sent somewhere — that great thing yonder on the tressels,—to be seen by the world , no doubt . And whoever its fate lay with would not see any greatness in it , or else no eyes would look . It came back as it went . No doubt they knew best;—in the world . That was in the spring of the year . He has been like this ever since . Walking most nights;—starving most days;—I think . But he is always silent . ”
212399	212441	212381	212382	The speaker	789	“ There must hang a crown of stars , I suppose — somewhere — since so many of them for ever try to reach one . But all they ever get here below is a crown of straws in a madhouse . ”
212442	212448	212452	212452	Sartorian	221	“ The woman says aright , ”
212484	212490	212491	212491	he	4678	“ The woman says aright , ”
212495	212524	212491	212491	he	4678	“ This man will perish ; his body may not die , but his brain will — surely . And yet for his life you would give yours ? ”
212568	212571	212572	212572	she	789	“ Ah ! ”
212581	212603	212572	212572	she	789	“ If the gods would but remember!—and take me instead . But they forget — they forget always . He smiled . “
212634	212700	212702	212702	you	789	” A scarlet flush burnt her from head to foot . For once she mistook his meaning . She thought — how could a beauty that he who perished there had scorned , have rarity or grace in those cold eyes , or force or light enough to lure him from his grave ? The low melody of the voice in her ear flowed on . “
212835	212836	212837	212837	You	789	” “
212844	212852	212837	212837	You	789	” she muttered , in her throat . “
212987	213077	213086	213087	many foes	4688	” He paused and waited . She watched silent on the threshold there . The cruel skill of his words cast on her all the weight of this ruin which they watched . Her love must need be weak , her pledge to the gods must needs be but imperfectly redeemed , since she , who had bade them let her perish in his stead , recoiled from the lingering living death of any shame , if such could save him . The sweet voice of Sartorian murmured on : “
213175	213196	213170	213170	you	0	” She writhed from him , as the doe struck to the ground writhes from the hounds at her throat . “
213200	213204	213170	213170	you	0	” she muttered . “
213218	213222	213170	213170	you	0	” Sartorian smiled . “
213506	214945	213503	213503	I	0	” He looked at her once , then turned away . He left in her soul the barbed sting of remorse . He had made her think her faith , her love , her strength , her sinless force , were but the cowardly fruit of cruellest self‐love , that dared all things in words,—yet in action failed . To save him by any martyrdom of her body or her soul , so she had sworn ; yet now ! — Suddenly she seemed base to herself , and timorous , and false . When daybreak came fully over the roofs of the city , it found him senseless , sightless , dying in a garret : the only freedom that he had reached was the delirious liberty of the brain , which , in its madness , casts aside all bonds of time and place and memory and reason . All the day she watched beside him , there , amidst the brazen clangour of the bells and scream of the rough winds above the roofs . In the gloom of the place , the burning colour of the great canvas of Jerusalem glowed in s wondrous pomp and power against all the grey , cold poverty of that wretched place . And the wanton laughed with her lover on the housetop ; and the thief clutched the rolling gold ; and the children lapped the purple steam of wasted wine ; and the throngs flocked after the thief , whom they had elected for their god ; and ever and again a stray flickering ray of light flashed from the gloom of the desolate chamber , and struck upon it till it glowed like flame;—this mighty parable , whereby the choice of the people was symbolised for all time ; the choice eternal , which never changes , but for ever turns from all diviner life to grovel in the dust before the Beast . The magnificence of thought , the glory of imagination , the radiance of colour which the canvas held , served only to make more naked , more barren , more hideous the absolute desolation which reigned around . Not one grace , not one charm , not one consolation had been left to the life of the man who had sacrificed all things to the inexorable tyranny of his genius . Destitution , in its ghastliest and most bitter meaning , was alone his recompense and portion . Save a few of the tools and pigments of his art , and a little opium in a broken glass , there was nothing there to stand between him and utter famine . When her eyes had first dwelt upon him lying senseless under the gaze of the gods , he had not been more absolutely destitute than he was now . The hard sharp outlines of his fleshless limbs , the sunken temples , the hollow cheeks , the heavy respiration which spoke each breath a pang,—all these told their story with an eloquence more cruel than lies in any words . He had dared to scourge the world without gold in his hand wherewith to bribe it to bear his stripes ; and the world had been stronger than he , and had taken its vengeance , and had cast him here powerless . All the day through she watched beside him — watched the dull mute suffering of stupor , which was only broken by fierce unconscious words muttered in the unknown tongue of his birth country . She could give him no aid , no food , no succour ; she was the slave of the poorest of the poor ; she had not upon her even so much as a copper piece to buy a crust of bread , a stoup of wine , a little cluster of autumn fruit to cool his burning lips . She had nothing,—she , who in the world of men had dared to be strong , and to shut her lips , and to keep her hands clean , and her feet straight ; she , whose soul had been closed against the Red Mouse . If she had gone down amongst the dancing throngs , and rioted with them , and feasted with them , and lived vilely , they would have hung her breast with gems , and paved her path with gold . That she knew ; and she could have saved him . Where she kneeled beside his bed she drew his hands against her heart — timidly , lest consciousness should come to him and he should curse her and drive her thence;—and laid her lips on them , and bathed them in the scorching dew of her hot tears , and prayed him to pardon her if it had been weakness in her,—if it had been feebleness and self‐pity thus to shrink from any abasement , any vileness , any martyrdom , if such could have done him service . She did not know ; she felt astray and blind , and full of guilt . It might be — so she thought — that it was thus the gods had tested her ; thus they had bade her suffer shame to give him glory ; thus they had tried her strength,—and found her wanting . Herself , she was so utterly nothing in her own sight , and he was so utterly all in all ; her life was a thing so undesired and so valueless , and his a thing so great and so measureless in majesty , that it seemed to her she might have erred in thrusting away infamy , since infamy would have brought with it gold to serve him . Dignity , innocence , strength , pride — what right had she to these , what title had she to claim them — she who had been less than the dust from her birth upward ? To perish for him anyhow — that was all that she had craved in prayer of the gods . And she watched him now all through the bitter day ; watched him dying of hunger , of fever , of endless desire , of continual failure,—and was helpless . More helpless even than she had been when first she had claimed back his life from Thanatos . Seven days she watched thus by him amidst the metal clangour of the bells , amidst the wailing of the autumn winds between the roofs . She moistened his lips with a little water : it was all he took . A few times she left him and stole down amidst the people whom she had served , and was met by a curse from most of them ; for they thought that she tended some unknown fever which she might bring amidst them , so they drove her back and would hear naught of her . A few , more pitiful than the rest , flung her twice or thrice a little broken bread ; she took it eagerly , and fed on it , knowing that she must keep life in her by some food , or leave him utterly alone . For him she had laid down all pride ; for him she would have kissed the feet of the basest or sued to the lowest for alms . And when the people — whose debts to her she had often forgiven , and whom she had once fancied had borne her a little love — drove her from them with harshest reviling , she answered nothing , but dropped her head and turned and crept again up the winding stairs to kneel beside his couch of straw , and wonder , in the bewildered anguish of her aching brain , if indeed evil were good,—since evil alone could save him . Seven days went by ; the chimes of the bells blown on the wild autumn winds in strange bursts of jangled sound ; the ceaseless murmur of the city ’s crowd surging ever on the silence from the far depths below ; sunrise and moonrise following one another with no change in the perishing life that she alone guarded , whilst every day the light that freshly rose upon the world found the picture of the Barabbas , and shone on the god rejected and the thief adored . Every night during those seven days the flute‐like voice of her tempter made hated music to her ear . It asked always , — “
214950	214978	214947	214947	you	4700	” Her ears were always deaf ; her lips were always dumb . On the eigth night Sartorian paused a little longer by her in the gloom . “
214983	214999	214979	214979	He	4701	” he said , slowly resting his tranquil musing gaze upon the bed of straw . “
215081	215101	215071	215071	their	2458	” Her strength was broken as she heard . She turned and flung herself in supplication at his feet . “
215114	215118	215109	215109	you	4705	” Sartorian smiled . “
215128	215146	215121	215121	you	4705	” She did not move ; her upraised face spoke without words the passion of her prayer . “
215165	215166	215167	215168	The gods	1366	” “
215173	215174	215167	215168	The gods	1366	” “
215187	215188	215189	215189	I	0	” “
215208	215209	215210	215210	You	4705	” “
215218	215223	215214	215214	you	4705	” He smiled still . “
215244	215268	215237	215237	You	4705	” She clung to him ; she writhed around him ; she kissed with her soilless lips the base dust at his feet . “
215348	215387	215388	215388	I	0	” She laughed where she was stretched upon the ground , a laugh that stayed the smile upon his mouth . He stooped , and the sweetness of his voice was low and soft as the south wind . “
215401	215436	215437	215437	I	0	” Where she was stretched face downward at his feet she shuddered , as though the folds of a snake curled round her , and stifled her , and slew her with a touch . “
215441	215449	215437	215437	I	0	” she muttered faintly in her throat . “
215455	215549	215437	215437	I	0	” he said ; and turned away . Once again he smiled,—and left her . The hours passed ; she did not move ; stretched there , she wrestled with her agony as the fate‐pursued wrestled with their doom on the steps of the temple , while the dread Eumenides drew round them and waited — waiting in cold patience for the slow sure end . She arose and went to Arslàn ’s side as a dying beast in the public roadway under a blow staggers to its feet to breathe its last . “
215554	215568	215437	215437	I	0	” she muttered , with lips dry as the lips of the dead . “
215573	215637	215638	215638	He	8318	” Once more the choice was left to her . So men said : and the gods were dead . An old creature , with a vulture ’s eyes and bony fingers , and rags that were plague‐stricken with the poisons of filth and of disease , had followed and looked at her in the doorway , and kicked her where she lay . “
215647	215663	215638	215638	He	8318	” he muttered , while his breath scorched her throat with the fumes of drink . “
215728	215750	215725	215726	a woman	4876	” He went away through the blackness and the stench , muttering , as he struck his staff upon each stair : “
215765	216014	215725	215726	a woman	4876	” She heard and shivered , and looked at the bed of straw , and on the great canvas of the Barabbas . Before another day had come and gone , he would lie in the common ditch of the poor , and the work of his hand would be withered , as a scroll withers in a flame . If she tried once more ? If she sought human pity , human aid ? Some deliverance , some mercy,—who could say ? — might yet be found , she thought . The gods were dead ; but men — were they all more wanton than the snake , more cruel than the scorpion ? For the first time in seven days she left his side to go forth into the living world . She rose and staggered for the garret , down the stairway , into the lower stories of the wilderness of wood and stone . She traced her way blindly to the places she had known . They closed their doors in haste , and fled from her in terror . They had heard that she had gone to tend some madman plague‐stricken with some nameless fever ; and those wretched lives to life clung closely , with a frantic love . One woman she stayed , and held with timid , eager hands . Of this woman she had taken nothing all the summer long in wage for waking her tired eyes at daybreak . “
216018	216022	215725	215726	a woman	4876	” she muttered . “
216040	216049	216036	216036	He	4723	” The woman shook her off and shrank . “
216054	216058	216051	216051	you	4722	” she cried . “
216070	216091	216092	216092	You	4722	” The others said the same , some less harshly , some more harshly . Twice or thrice they added : “
216133	216175	216223	216225	some who pity	4728	” Not one amongst them braved the peril of a touch of pity ; not one amongst them asked the story of her woe ; and when the little children ran to her their mothers plucked them back , and cried : “
216183	216218	216179	216179	She	4724	” She went from them in silence , and left them and passed out into the open air . In all this labyrinth of roofs , in all these human herds she yet thought , “
216227	216283	216223	216225	some who pity	4728	” For even yet she was so young ; and even yet she knew the world so little . She went out into the streets . Her brain was on fire , and her heart seemed frozen ; her lips moved without sound , and unconsciously shaped the words which night and day pursued her , “
216292	216507	216223	216225	some who pity	4728	” So slight a thing , they said , and yet high above reach as Aldebaran , when it glistened through the storm wrack of the rain . Why could he have not been content , as she had been , with the rush of the winds over the plains , the strife of the flood and the hurricane , the smell of the fruit‐hung ways at night , the cool green shadows of the summer woods , the courses of the clouds , the rapture of the keen air blowing from the sea , the flight of a bird over the tossing poppies , the day song of the lark,—all these were life enough for her ; were freedom , loveliness , companionship , and solace . Ah , God ! she thought , if only these had made the world of his desires likewise . And even in her ghastlier grief her heart sickened for them in vain anguish as she went — these the pure joys of earth and air which were her only heritage . She went out into the streets . It was a night of wind and rain . The lamps flickered through the watery darkness . Beggars and thieves and harlots jostled her in the narrow ways . “
216519	216718	216223	216225	some who pity	4728	” she muttered , as she stood alone on the flints of the roads , in the rancid smell , in the hideous riot , in the ghastly mirth , in the choking stench , in the thick steam of the darkness , whose few dull gleams of yellow light served to show the false red on a harlot ’s cheek , or the bleeding wound on a crippled horse , or the reeling dance of a drunkard . It was the hell of the Christians : in it there was no hope for her . She moved on with slow unconscious movement of her limbs ; her hair blew back , her eyes had a pitiless wonder in their vacant stare ; her bloodless face had the horror in it that Greek sculptors gave to the face of those whom a relentless destiny pursued and hunted down ; ever and again she looked back as she went , as though some nameless , shapeless , unutterable horror were behind her in her steps . The people called her mad , and laughed and hooted her ; when they had any space to think of her at all . “
216732	216861	216862	216863	a beggar	602	” she murmured ; for her own needs she had never asked a crust in charity , but for his,—she would have kissed the mud from the feet of any creature who would have had thus much of mercy . In answer they only mocked her , some struck her int he palm of her outstretched hand . Some called her by foul names ; some seized her with a drunken laugh , and cursed her as she writhed from their lewd hold ; some , and these often women , whispered to her of the bagnio and the brothel ; some muttered against her as a thief ; one , a youth , who gave her the gentlest answer that she had , murmured in her ear , “
216875	216950	216993	216993	fool	4877	” She went on through the sulphurous yellow gare , and the poisonous steam of these human styes , shuddering from the hands that grasped , the voices that wooed her , the looks that ravished her , the laughs that mocked her . It was the hell of the Christians ; it was a city at midnight ; and its very stones seemed to arise and give tongue in her derision and cry , “
217027	217106	217107	217107	She	4740	” She stumbled on through the narrow ways . After a little space they widened , and the lights multiplied , and through the rushing rains she saw the gay casements of the houses of pleasure . On a gust of wind there came a breath of fragrance from a root of autumn blossom in a balcony . The old sweet woodland smell smote her as with a blow ; the people in the street looked after her . “
217111	217172	217107	217107	She	4740	” they said to one another , and went onward . She came to a broad place , which even in that night of storm was still a blaze of fire , and seemed to her to laugh through all its marble mask , and all its million eyes of golden light . A cruel laugh which mocked and said : “
217239	217382	217236	217237	one God	8318	” Under one of the burning cressets of flame there was a slab of stone on which were piled , bedded in leaves , all red and gold , with pomp of autumn , the fruit of the vine in great clear pyramids of white and purple ; tossed there so idly in such profusion from the past vintage time , that a copper coin or two could buy a feast for half a score of months . Some of the clusters rotted already from their over ripeness . She looked at them with the passionate woful eyes of a dog mad with thirst , which can see water and yet can not reach it . She leaned towards them , she caught their delicious coldness in her burning hands , she breathed in their old familiar fragrance with quick convulsive breath . “
217387	217403	217383	217383	He	4744	” she muttered , lifting her face to the eyes of the woman guarding her . “
217432	217580	217409	217409	you	4748	” The woman thrust her away , and raised , shrill and sharp through all the clamour of the crowd , the cry of thief . A score of hands were stretched to seize her , only the fleetness of her feet saved her . She escaped from them , and as a hare flies to her form , so she fled to the place whence she came . She had done all she could ; she had made one effort , for his sake ; and all living creatures had repulsed her . None would believe ; none would pity ; none would hear . Her last strength was broken , her last faint hope had failed . In her utter wretchedness she ceased to wonder , she ceased to revolt , she accepted the fate which all men told her was her heritage and portion . “
217588	217592	217583	217583	I	0	” she thought , “
217629	217764	217765	217765	They	4751	” She went back to the place where he lay — dying , unless help came to him . She climbed the stairway , and stole through the foulness and the darkness of the winding ways , and retraced her steps , and stood upon his threshold . She had been absent but one hour ; yet already the last , most abject , most wretched penalty of death had come to him . They robbed him in his senselessness . The night was wet . The rain dropped through the roof . The rats fought on the floor and climbed the walls . The broken lattice blew to and fro with every gust of wind . A palsied crone , with ravenous hands ; sheared the locks of his fair hair , muttering , “
217783	217830	217774	217774	they	4751	” The old man who owned the garret crammed into a wallet such few things of metal , or of wood , or of paper , as were left in the utter poverty of the place , muttering as he gathered the poor shreds of art , “
217856	217900	217845	217845	I	0	” The rats hurried to their holes at the light ; the hag let fall her shears , and fled through an opening in the wall . The old man looked up and smiled with a ghastly leer upon her in the shadows . “
217909	217924	217902	217902	I	0	” he said , as he passed out , bearing his wallet with him . “
217966	218136	217845	217845	I	0	” And he grinned in her eyes as he passed her . A shiver shook her ; she said nothing ; it seemed to her as though she would never speak again . She set down her lamp , and crossed the chamber , and kneeled down beside the straw that made his bed . She was quite calm . She knew that the world gave her one chance — one only . She knew that men alone reigned , and that the gods were dead . She flung herself beside him on the straw and wound her arms about him , and laid his head to rest upon her heart ; one moment — he would never know . Between them there would be for ever silence . He would never know . Greatness would come to him , and the dominion of gold ; and the work of his hands would pass amidst the treasures of the nations ; and he would live and arise and say , “
218143	218738	218140	218140	my	0	mine,”—and yet he would never know that one creature had so loved him that she had perished more horribly than by death to save him . If he lived to the uttermost years of man , he would never know how , body and soul , she had passed away to destruction for his sake . To die for him ! She laughed to think how sweet and calm such sacrifice as that had been . Amidst the folded lilies , on the white waters , as the moon rose,—she laughed to think how she had sometimes dreamed to slay herself in such tender summer peace for him . That was how women perished when men loved , and loved enough to die with them , their lips upon each other ’s to the last . But she — Death in peace ; sacrifice in honour ; a little memory in a human heart ; a little place in a great hereafter ; there were things too noble for her — so they said . A martyrdom in shame ; a life in ignominy — these were all to which she might aspire — so they said . Upon his breast women would sink to sleep ; amongst his hair their hands would wander , and on his mouth their sighs would spend themselves . Shut in the folded leaves of the unblossomed years some dreams of passion and some flower of love must lie for him — that she knew . She loved him with that fierce and envious force which grudged the wind its privilege to breathe upon his lips , the earth its right to bear his footsteps , which was for ever jealous of the mere echo of his voice , avaricious of the mere touch of his hand . And when she gave him to the future , she gave him to other eyes , that would grow blind with passion , meeting his ; to other forms , that would burn with sweetest shame beneath his gaze ; to other lives , whose memories would pass with his to the great Hereafter , made immortal by his touch : all these she gave , she knew . Almost it was stronger than her strength . Almost she yielded to the desire which burned in her to let him die,—and die there with him,—and so hold him for ever hers , and not the world ’s ; his and none other ’s in the eternal unison of the grave , so that with hers his beauty should be consumed , and so that with hers his beauty should be shut from human sight , and the same corruption feed together on their hearts . Almost she yielded ; but the greatness of her love was stronger than its vileness , and its humility was more perfect than its cruelty . It seemed to her,—mad , and bruised , and stunned with her misery,—that for a thing so worthless and loveless and despised as she to suffer the deadliest shame to save a life so great as his was , after all , a fate more noble than she could have hoped . For her — what could it matter?—a thing baser than the dust,—whether the feet of men trampled her in scorn a little more , a little less , before she sank away into the eternal night wherein all things are equal and all things forgotten ? THAT night the moon found the Red Mouse , and said : “
218757	218758	218749	218749	you	0	” “
218766	218804	218760	218762	the Red Mouse	211	“ Nay , not so . For the soul still is closed against me ; and the soul still is pure . But this men do not see , and women can not know;—they are so blind . ”
218885	218897	218903	218904	a woman	4876	“ Truly this man is great , and truth is terrible . ”
219122	219126	219127	219127	he	4763	“ So soon ? ”
219214	219219	219204	219204	they	4769	“ For thy sake ! ”
219968	219983	219998	220000	a human form	4805	“ Sleep , dreams , and death:—we are the only gods that answer prayer . ”
220374	220611	220612	220612	Thanatos	167	“ How long — how long ? Wilt thou never take pity , and stoop and say ‘ Enough ? ’ I have kept faith ; I have kept silence to the end . The gods know . My life for his ; my soul for his . So I said ; so I have given . I would not have it otherwise . See : I am glad , I am proud , I am strong . See , I have never spoken . The gods have let me perish in his stead . Nay ; I suffer nothing . What can it matter for me ? Nay ; I thank thee that thou hast given my vileness to be the means of his glory . He is great , he has his desire ; and I — I am less than the dust . What matter ? He must not know ; he must never know . And one day I might be weak , or mad , and speak . Take me whilst still I am strong . A little while ago , in a space in the crowds , he saw me . ‘ So soon ! ’ he said,—and smiled . And yet I live ! Keep faith with me ; keep faith at last . Slay me now , quickly , for pity ’s sake ; lest once I speak ! ”
220689	220830	220659	220660	the gods	1366	“ A thing as free as we , and as fair as ye , is dead ; a thing whose joys were made , like ours , from song of the birds , from sight of the sun , from sound of the waters , from smell of the fields ; from the tossing spray of the white fruit blossoms , from the play of the grasses at sunrise , from all the innocent liberties of earth and air . She has perished as a trampled leaf , as a broken shell , as a rose that falls in the public ways , as a star that is cast down an autumn night . She has died as the dust dies ; and none sorrow . What matter ? Men are wise , and gods are just , they say . ”
221032	221041	221019	221021	The Red Mouse	211	“ To the end she hath escaped me . ”
221195	221204	221205	221205	they	4826	“ It is that evil thing of Yprès , ”
221239	221252	221253	221253	they	4826	“ It were a righteous act to thrust her in a grave , ”
221263	221268	221269	221269	they	4826	“ Ay , truly , ”
221272	221297	221300	221300	they	4826	“ otherwise she may break the bonds of Death and rise again and haunt us always ; who can say ? But the gold — ”
221304	221310	221311	221311	one	1305	“ It were a sin , ”
221314	221336	221311	221311	one	1305	“ it were a sin to bury the pure good gold in the darkness . Even if it come from hell — ”
221337	221346	221348	221350	the other twain	4834	“ The priests will bless it for us , ”
221796	221822	221789	221789	his	167	“ I am the only pity of the world . And even I,—to every mortal thing I come , too early , or too late . ”
