426	439	441	443	a tall youth	307	“ It is no use trying to dance a reel without Hadria , ”
485	507	508	508	Algitha	81	“ Old Maggie said the other day , that Hadria 's dancing of the reel was no ‘ right canny , ’ ”
526	529	531	531	Fred	83	“ Ah ! ”
533	580	531	531	Fred	83	“ old Maggie has always looked upon Hadria as half bewitched since that night when she found her here ‘ a wee bit bairn , ’ as she says , at this very window , in her nightshirt , standing on tiptoe to see the moonlight . ”
581	596	598	598	Algitha	81	“ It frightened the poor old thing out of her wits , of course , ”
711	722	724	724	Austin	84	“ Tell us the story of the garret , Hadria , ”
744	763	724	724	Austin	84	“ Hadria has told it hundreds of times , and you know it as well as she does . ”
764	797	724	724	Austin	84	“ But I want to hear it again — about the attack upon the keep , and the shouting of the men , while the lady was up here starving to death . ”
804	821	801	801	her	81	“ We do n't come up here to tell stories , we must get to business . ”
822	834	836	836	Fred	83	“ Will you have the candle , or can you see ? ”
873	889	890	890	Fred	83	“ I think I had better have the candle ; my notes are very illegible . ”
1009	1014	1015	1015	she	211	“ Ladies and gentlemen , ”
1018	1051	1015	1015	she	211	“ on the last occasion on which the Preposterous Society held its meeting , we had the pleasure of listening to an able lecture on ‘ Character ’ by our respected member Demogorgon ”
1065	1094	1095	1096	The audience	323	“ My address to - night on ‘ Fate ’ is designed to contribute further ideas to this fascinating subject , and to pursue the enquiry more curiously . ”
1100	1176	1095	1096	The audience	323	“ We were left at loggerheads , at the end of the last debate . I doubted Demogorgon 's conclusion , while admiring his eloquence . To - night , I will put before you the view exactly contrary to his . I do not assert that I hold this contrary view , but I state it as well as I am able , because I think that it has not been given due consideration . ”
1177	1183	1184	1184	Fred	83	“ This will be warm , ”
1205	1210	1211	1211	she	306	“ I will read , ”
1214	1233	1211	1211	she	306	“ a passage from Emerson , which states very strikingly the doctrine that I am going to oppose . ”
1266	1336	1337	1337	Algitha	81	“ ‘ But the soul contains the event that shall befall it , for the event is only the actualization of its thoughts ; and what we pray to ourselves for is always granted . The event is the print of your form . It fits you like your skin . What each does is proper to him . Events are the children of his mind and body . ’ ”
1588	1593	1595	1595	Ernest	86	“ Hear , hear , ”
1597	1602	1595	1595	Ernest	86	“ my particular thunder ! ”
1603	1608	1610	1611	the lecturer	339	“ Wait a minute , ”
1613	1625	1626	1626	She	339	“ I am going to annihilate you with your particular thunder . ”
1651	1757	1633	1633	her	339	“ Roughly , we may say that people are divided into two orders : first , the organizers , the able , those who build , who create cohesion , symmetry , reason , economy ; and , secondly , the destroyers , those who come wandering idly by , and unfasten , undo , relax , disintegrate all that has been effected by the force and vigilance of their betters . This distinction is carried into even the most trivial things of life . Yet without that organization and coherence , the existence of the destroyers themselves would become a chaos and a misery . ”
1791	1794	1795	1796	the speaker	306	“ Thus , ”
1800	1891	1795	1796	the speaker	306	“ these relaxed and derivative people are living on the strength of the strong . He who is strong must carry with him , as a perpetual burden , a mass of such pensioners , who are scared and shocked at his rude individuality ; and if he should trip or stumble , if he should lose his way in the untrodden paths , in seeking new truth and a broader foundation for the lives of men , then a chorus of censure goes up from millions of little throats . ”
1892	1897	1901	1901	Fred	83	“ Hear , hear ! ”
1909	1946	1795	1796	the speaker	306	“ But when the good things are gained for which the upholders have striven and perhaps given their lives , then there are no more greedy absorbers of the bounty than these same innumerable little throats . ”
1955	1959	1961	1962	the lecturer	339	“ And now , ”
1965	2115	1961	1962	the lecturer	339	” consider this in relation to the point at issue . Emerson asserts that circumstance can always be conquered . But is not circumstance , to a large extent , created by these destroyers , as I have called them ? Has not the strongest soul to count with these , who weave the web of adverse conditions , whose dead weight has to be carried , whose work of destruction has to be incessantly repaired ? Who can dare to say ‘ I am master of my fate , ’ when he does not know how large may be the share of the general burden that will fall to him to drag through life , how great may be the number of these parasites who are living on the moral capital of their generation ? Surely circumstance consists largely in the inertia , the impenetrability of the destroyers . ”
2132	2135	2137	2138	the lecturer	339	“ Presently , ”
2141	2149	2150	2150	she	339	“ Or put it in another way , ”
2154	2252	2150	2150	she	339	“ A man may make a thing — circumstance included — but he is not a sort of moral spider ; he ca n't spin it out of his own inside . He wants something to make it of . The formative force comes from within , but he must have material , just as much as a sculptor must have his marble before he can shape his statue . There is a subtle relation between character and conditions , and it is this relation that determines Fate . Fate is as the statue of the sculptor . ”
2253	2263	2265	2265	Fred	83	“ That 's where Hadria mainly differs from you , ”
2267	2282	2265	2265	Fred	83	“ you make the thing absolute ; Hadria makes it a matter of relation . ”
2283	2286	2288	2289	the lecturer	339	“ Exactly , ”
2295	2392	2288	2289	the lecturer	339	“ Difficulties need not be really obstructive to the best development of a character or a power , nor a smooth path always favourable . Obstacles may be of a kind to stimulate one person and to annihilate another . It is not a question of relative strength between character and circumstance , as people are so fond of asserting . That is mere gibberish . It means nothing . The two things can not be compared , for they are not of the same nature . They ca n't be reduced to a common denominator . ”
2406	2489	2490	2490	Ernest	86	“ We shall never be able to take a reasonable view of this question till we get rid of that ridiculous phrase , ‘ If the soul is strong enough , it can overcome circumstance . ’ In a room filled with carbonic acid instead of ordinary air , a giant would succumb as quickly as a dwarf , and his strength would avail him nothing . Indeed , if there is a difference , it is in favour of the dwarf . ”
2538	2541	2543	2543	Hadria	211	“ Finally , ”
2551	2615	2543	2543	Hadria	211	“ let us put the question shortly thus : Given ( say ) great artistic power , given also a conscience and a strong will , is there any combination of circumstances which might prevent the artistic power ( assuming it to be of the highest order and strength ) from developing and displaying itself , so as to meet with general recognition ? ”
2616	2619	2621	2621	Ernest	86	“ No , ”
2633	2646	2647	2647	Hadria	211	“ There seem to me to be a thousand chances against it , ”
2650	2762	2647	2647	Hadria	211	“ Artistic power , to begin with , is a sort of weakness in relation to the everyday world , and so , in some respects , is a nice conscience . I think Emerson is shockingly unjust . His beaming optimism is a worship of success disguised under lofty terms . There is nothing to prove that thousands have not been swamped by maladjustment of character to circumstance , and I would even go so far as to suggest that perhaps the very greatest of all are those whom the world has never known , because the present conditions are inharmonious with the very noblest and the very highest qualities . ”
2862	2875	2876	2876	she	211	“ We shall be heard , if you do n't take care , ”
2879	2924	2876	2876	she	211	“ My dear Algitha , there are a dozen empty rooms between us and the inhabited part of the house , not to mention the fact that we are a storey above everyone except the ghosts , so I think you may compose yourself . ”
3198	3207	3208	3208	she	363	“ You have the easier cause to champion , ”
3218	3266	3208	3208	she	363	“ for all your evidences can be pointed to and counted whereas mine , poor things — pale hypotheses , nameless peradventures — lie in forgotten church - yards — unthought of , unthanked , untrumpeted , and all their tragedy is lost in the everlasting silence . ”
3267	3280	3282	3282	Algitha	81	“ You will never make people believe in what might have been , ”
3284	3291	3282	3282	Algitha	81	“ I do n't expect to . ”
3310	3321	3322	3322	she	363	“ Life is as white and as unsympathetic as this , ”
3326	3390	3322	3322	she	363	“ We just dance our reel in our garret , and then it is all over ; and whether we do the steps as our fancy would have them , or a little otherwise , because of the uneven floor , or tired feet , or for lack of chance to learn the steps — heavens and earth , what does it matter ? ”
3391	3394	3396	3398	an astonished chorus	375	“ Hadria ! ”
3438	3453	3454	3454	she	363	“ Oh , it is only the moonlight that has got into my head , ”
3478	3496	3497	3497	she	363	“ But I think it matters very much whether one 's task is done well or ill , ”
3500	3530	3497	3497	she	363	“ and nobody has taught me to wish to make solid use of my life so much as you have , Hadria . What possesses you to - night ? ”
3531	3539	3454	3454	she	363	“ I tell you , the moonlight . ”
3540	3545	3454	3454	she	363	“ And something else . ”
3546	3613	3454	3454	she	363	“ Well , it struck me , as I stood there with my head full of what we have been discussing , that the conditions of a girl 's life of our own class are pleasant enough , but they are stifling , absolutely stifling ; and not all the Emersons in the world will convince me to the contrary . Emerson never was a girl ! ”
3619	3629	3631	3631	Ernest	86	“ No ; but he was a great man , ”
3633	3646	3648	3648	Hadria	211	“ Then he must have had something of the girl in him ! ”
3650	3663	3648	3648	Hadria	211	“ I did n't mean that , but perhaps it is true . ”
3664	3717	3454	3454	she	363	“ If he had been a girl , he would have known that conditions do count hideously in one 's life . I think that there are more ‘ destroyers ’ to be carried about and pampered in this department of existence than in any other ( material conditions being equal ) . ”
3718	3745	3747	3747	Fred	83	“ Do you mean that a girl would have more difficulty in bringing her power to maturity and getting it recognized than a man would have ? ”
3749	3758	3747	3747	Fred	83	“ Yes ; the odds are too heavy . ”
3759	3767	3768	3768	Ernest	86	“ A second - rate talent perhaps , ”
3771	3779	3768	3768	Ernest	86	“ but not a really big one . ”
3780	3788	3790	3790	Hadria	211	“ I should exactly reverse that statement , ”
3792	3868	3790	3790	Hadria	211	“ The greater the power and the finer its quality , the greater the inharmony between the nature and the conditions ; therefore the more powerful the leverage against it . A small comfortable talent might hold its own , where a larger one would succumb . That is where I think you make your big mistake , in forgetting that the greatness of the power may serve to make the greatness of the obstacles . ”
3869	3878	3880	3880	Algitha	81	“ So much the better for me then , ”
3888	3898	3899	3899	She	81	“ for I have no idea of being beaten . ”
3910	3934	3936	3936	Ernest	86	“ Surely it only wants a little force of will to enable you to occupy your life in the manner you think best , ”
3938	3955	3936	3936	Ernest	86	“ That is often impossible for a girl , because prejudice and custom are against her . ”
3956	3966	3968	3969	the brother	380	“ But she ought to despise prejudice and custom , ”
3973	3995	3968	3969	the brother	380	“ So she often would ; but then she has to tear through so many living ties that restrain her freedom . ”
4001	4008	4009	4009	she	81	“ If one is unjustly restrained , ”
4012	4041	4009	4009	she	81	“ it is perfectly right to brave the infliction of the sort of pain that people feel only because they unfairly object to one 's liberty of action . ”
4042	4055	4057	4057	Hadria	211	“ But what a frightful piece of circumstance that is to encounter , ”
4059	4175	4057	4057	Hadria	211	“ to have to buy the mere right to one 's liberty by cutting through prejudices that are twined in with the very heart - strings of those one loves ! Ah ! that particular obstacle has held many a woman helpless and suffering , like some wretched insect pinned alive to a board throughout a miserable lifetime ! What would Emerson say to these cases ? That ‘ Nature magically suits the man to his fortunes by making these the fruit of his character ’ ? Pooh ! I think Nature more often makes a man 's fortunes a veritable shirt of Nessus which burns and clings , and finally kills him with anguish ! ”
4211	4214	4009	4009	she	81	“ airds , ”
4710	4718	4767	4767	Her	211	“ message of range and of sweep — ”
5346	5349	5351	5351	they	439	“ clints , ”
5554	5562	5564	5564	Hadria	211	“ I thought I recognised your footsteps , ”
5713	5720	5722	5722	Ernest	86	“ Let 's make a bonfire , ”
6357	6371	6373	6373	Hadria	211	“ Come and see what visions you have conjured up , O witch ! ”
6426	6433	6434	6434	she	211	“ If life is like that , ”
6444	6470	6434	6434	she	211	“ nothing on this earth ought to persuade us to forgo it ; no one has the right to hold one back from its possession . ”
6471	6475	6477	6477	Hadria	211	“ No one , ”
6479	6485	6477	6477	Hadria	211	“ but everyone will try ! ”
6486	6491	6493	6493	Algitha	81	“ Let them try , ”
6602	6606	6608	6608	Ernest	86	“ I admit , ”
6620	6690	6608	6608	Ernest	86	“ I admit that I should not like to stay here during all the best years of my life , without prospect of widening my experience ; only as a matter of fact , the world is somewhat different from anything that you imagine , and by no means would you find it all beer and skittles . Your smoke and sun - vision is not to be trusted . ”
6691	6710	6712	6712	Hadria	211	“ But think of the pride and joy of being able to speak in that tone of experience ! ”
6715	6723	6725	6725	Ernest	86	“ One has to pay for experience , ”
6735	6747	6748	6748	she	211	“ I think one has to pay more heavily for inexperience , ”
6751	6787	6748	6748	she	211	“ Not if one never comes in contact with the world . Girls are protected from the realities of life so long as they remain at home , and that is worth something after all . ”
6791	6827	6788	6788	Algitha	81	“ I do n't know what you are pleased to call realities , my dear Ernest , but I can assure you there are plenty of unpleasant facts , in this protected life of ours . ”
6828	6837	6839	6839	Ernest	86	“ Nobody can expect to escape unpleasant facts , ”
6841	6857	6858	6858	Hadria	211	“ Then for heaven 's sake , let us purchase with them something worth having ! ”
6861	6866	6868	6868	Algitha	81	“ Hear , hear ! ”
6870	6878	6879	6879	Hadria	211	“ Unpleasant facts being a foregone conclusion , ”
6882	6898	6879	6879	Hadria	211	“ the point to aim at obviously is interesting facts — and plenty of them . ”
6928	6946	6947	6947	he	86	“ I never met girls before , who wanted to come out of their cotton - wool , ”
6950	6964	6947	6947	he	86	“ I thought girls loved cotton - wool . They always seem to . ”
6965	6978	6980	6980	Hadria	211	“ Girls seem an astonishing number of things that they are not , ”
6982	7017	6980	6980	Hadria	211	“ especially to men . A poor benighted man might as well try to get on to confidential terms with the Sphinx , as to learn the real thoughts and wishes of a girl . ”
7018	7027	7029	7029	Ernest	86	“ You two are exceptional , you see , ”
7031	7044	7046	7047	his sister	351	“ Oh , everybody 's exceptional , if you only knew it ! ”
7049	7052	7053	7053	she	351	“ Girls , ”
7059	7116	7053	7053	she	351	“ are stuffed with certain stereotyped sentiments from their infancy , and when that painful process is completed , intelligent philosophers come and smile upon the victims , and point to them as proofs of the intentions of Nature regarding our sex , admirable examples of the unvarying instincts of the feminine creature . In fact , ”
7123	7181	7117	7117	Hadria	211	“ it 's as if the trainer of that troop of performing poodles that we saw , the other day , at Ballochcoil , were to assure the spectators that the amiable animals were inspired , from birth , by a heaven - implanted yearning to jump through hoops , and walk about on their hind legs — ”
7182	7192	7194	7194	Ernest	86	“ But there are such things as natural instincts , ”
7196	7205	7194	7194	Ernest	86	“ There are such things as acquired tricks , ”
7243	7254	7256	7256	Ernest	86	“ You have broken in upon a most interesting discourse , ”
7258	7265	7256	7256	Ernest	86	“ Hadria was really coming out . ”
7302	7305	7297	7298	These two	498	“ chums , ”
7398	7404	7405	7405	Hadria	211	“ What always bewilders me , ”
7416	7482	7405	7405	Hadria	211	“ is the enormous gulf between what might be and what is in human life . Look at the world — life 's most sumptuous stage — and look at life ! The one , splendid , exquisite , varied , generous , rich beyond description ; the other , poor , thin , dull , monotonous , niggard , distressful — is that necessary ? ”
7483	7492	7494	7494	Fred	83	“ But all lives are not like that , ”
7496	7506	7508	7508	Hadria	211	“ I speak only from my own narrow experience , ”
7510	7526	7528	7528	Earnest	86	“ Oh , she is thinking , as usual , of that unfortunate Mrs. Gordon ! ”
7530	7549	7528	7528	Earnest	86	“ Of her , and the rest of the average , typical sort of people that I know , ”
7553	7567	7550	7550	Hadria	211	“ I wish to heaven I had a wider knowledge to speak from . ”
7568	7580	7582	7582	Algitha	81	“ If one is to believe what one hears and reads , ”
7584	7594	7582	7582	Algitha	81	“ a life must be full of sorrow indeed . ”
7595	7603	7605	7606	her sister	313	“ But putting aside the big sorrows , ”
7608	7633	7605	7606	her sister	313	“ the ordinary every day existence that would be called prosperous , seems to me to be dull and stupid to a tragic extent . ”
7634	7653	7655	7655	Fred	83	“ The Gordons of Drumgarran once more ! I confess I ca n't see anything particularly tragic there , ”
7686	7697	7699	7699	Hadria	211	“ It is more than tragic ; it is disgusting ! ”
7716	7869	7709	7709	She	81	“ Look here , Ernest ; you said just now that girls were shielded from the realities of life . Yet Mrs. Gordon was handed over by her protectors , when she was little more than a school - girl , without knowledge , without any sort of resource or power of facing destiny , to — well , to the hateful realities of the life that she has led now for over twenty years . There is nothing to win general sympathy in this case , for Mr. Gordon is good and kind ; but oh , think of the existence that a ‘ protected , ’ carefully brought - up girl may be launched into ; before she knows what she is pledged to , or what her ideas of life may be ! If that is what you call protection , for heaven 's sake let us remain defenceless . ”
8244	8258	8259	8259	Ernest	86	“ Mrs. Gordon 's people meant it for the best , I suppose , ”
8262	8276	8259	8259	Ernest	86	“ when they married her to a good man with a fine property . ”
8277	8287	8289	8289	Hadria	211	“ That is just the ghastly part of it ! ”
8291	8315	8289	8289	Hadria	211	“ from ferocious enemies a girl might defend herself , but what is she to do against the united efforts of devoted friends ? ”
8316	8333	8259	8259	Ernest	86	“ I do n't suppose Mrs. Gordon is aware that she is so ill - used ! ”
8334	8339	8341	8341	Hadria	211	“ Another gruesome circumstance ! ”
8348	8368	8341	8341	Hadria	211	“ for that only proves that her life has dulled her self - respect , and destroyed her pride . ”
8369	8388	8259	8259	Ernest	86	“ But , my dear , every woman is in the same predicament , if predicament it be ! ”
8389	8394	8395	8395	Hadria	211	“ What a consolation ! ”
8398	8407	8395	8395	Hadria	211	“ all the foxes have lost their tails ! ”
8408	8424	8259	8259	Ernest	86	“ It may be illogical , but people generally are immensely comforted by that circumstance . ”
8493	8500	8472	8472	Algitha	81	“ Well , Harold Wilkins says — ”
8512	8527	8529	8529	Fred	83	“ I do n't see why you girls always scoff so at Harold Wilkins , ”
8534	8553	8529	8529	Fred	83	“ he is generally thought a lot of by girls . All Mrs. Gordon 's sisters adore him . ”
8554	8561	8563	8563	Hadria	211	“ He needs no further worshippers , ”
8585	8593	8595	8595	Fred	83	“ He laughs at your pet ideas , ”
8598	8607	8595	8595	Fred	83	“ Break it gently , Fred , gently . ”
8608	8630	8639	8639	Hadria	211	“ He thinks that a true woman esteems it her highest privilege to — well , to be like Mrs. Gordon . ”
8631	8637	8639	8639	Hadria	211	“ Wise and learned youth ! ”
8660	8663	8665	8665	Algitha	81	“ Fool ! ”
8667	8671	8673	8673	Fred	83	“ He says , ”
8688	8707	8673	8673	Fred	83	“ he says that girls who have ideas like yours will never get any fellow to marry them . ”
8716	8719	8721	8721	Fred	83	“ Laughter , ”
8730	8765	8721	8721	Fred	83	“ is among the simplest forms of argument . Does this merry outburst imply that you do n't care a button whether you are able to get some one to marry you or not ? ”
8766	8770	8772	8772	Algitha	81	“ It does , ”
8774	8862	8863	8863	Fred	83	“ Well , so I said to Wilkins , as a matter of fact , with my nose in the air , on your behalf , and Wilkins replied , ‘ Oh , it 's all very well while girls are young and good - looking to be so high and mighty , but some day , when they are left out in the cold , and all their friends married , they may sing a different tune . ’ Feeling there was something in this remark , ”
8866	8926	8863	8863	Fred	83	“ I raised my nose two inches higher , and adopted the argument that I also resort to in extremis . I laughed . ‘ Well , my dear fellow , ’ Wilkins observed calmly , ‘ I mean no offence , but what on earth is a girl to do with herself if she does n't marry ? ’ ”
8927	8933	8935	8935	Ernest	86	“ What did you reply ? ”
8939	8955	8956	8956	Algitha	81	“ Oh , I said that was an unimportant detail , and changed the subject . ”
8966	8974	8975	8975	she	211	“ Harold Wilkins has a practical mind , ”
8978	8993	8975	8975	she	211	“ After all , he is right , when you come to consider it . ”
8994	8997	8999	9000	her sister	313	“ Hadria ! ”
9005	9013	9015	9015	Hadria	211	“ We may as well be candid , ”
9017	9093	9015	9015	Hadria	211	“ There is uncommonly little that a girl can do ( or rather that people will let her do ) unless she marries , and that is why she so often does marry as a mere matter of business . But I wish Harold Wilkins would remember that fact , instead of insisting that it is our inherent and particular nature that urges us , one and all , to the career of Mrs. Gordon . ”
9136	9160	9161	9161	she	81	“ If one simply made up one 's mind to walk through all the hampering circumstances , who or what could stop one ? ”
9164	9181	9183	9183	Fred	83	“ Algitha has evidently got some desperate plan in her head for making mincemeat of circumstances , ”
9195	9217	9219	9219	Hadria	211	“ Do you remember that Mrs. Gordon herself waged a losing battle in early days , incredible as it may appear ? ”
9232	9265	9225	9225	her	81	“ She did not originally set out with the idea of being a sort of amiable cow . She once aspired to be quite human ; she really did , poor thing ! ”
9266	9275	9277	9277	Algitha	81	“ Then why did n't she do it ? ”
9280	9323	9277	9277	Algitha	81	“ Instead of doing a thing , she had to be perpetually struggling for the chance to do it , which she never achieved , and so she was submerged . That seems to be the fatality in a woman 's life . ”
9324	9337	9339	9339	Algitha	81	“ Well , there is one thing I am very sure of , ”
9363	9401	9359	9359	her	81	“ I do not intend to be a cow . I do not mean to fight a losing battle . I will not wait at home meekly , till some fool holds out his sceptre to me . ”
9411	9420	9432	9432	them	539	“ But what are you going to do ? ”
9500	9534	9535	9535	she	81	“ I am not going to be hawked about the county till I am disposed of . It does not console me in the least , that all the foxes are without tails , ”
9550	9567	9535	9535	she	81	“ I am going to London with Mrs. Trevelyan , to help her in her work . ”
9568	9572	9574	9574	Fred	83	“ By Jove ! ”
9759	9767	9769	9769	Fred	83	“ Next time I meet Harold Wilkins , ”
9776	9797	9769	9769	Fred	83	“ I will tell him that if a girl does not marry , she can devote herself to the poor . ”
9798	9824	9847	9847	her	211	“ Or that she can remain to be the family consolation , eh , Hadria ? By Jove , what a row there will be ! ”
9903	9916	9918	9918	Ernest	86	“ It does seem to indicate rather a broken - down family ! ”
9920	9937	9939	9939	Hadria	211	“ I wish one of you boys would undertake the position instead of laughing at me , ”
9944	10020	9939	9939	Hadria	211	“ I wish you would go to eternal tennis - parties , and pay calls , and bills , and write notes , and do little useless necessary things , more or less all day . I wish you had before you the choice between that existence and the career of Mrs. Gordon , with the sole chance of escape from either fate , in ruthlessly trampling upon the bleeding hearts of two beloved parents ! ”
10021	10026	10028	10028	Fred	83	“ Thank you kindly , ”
10030	10040	10028	10028	Fred	83	“ but we infinitely prefer to laugh at you . ”
10041	10052	10054	10054	Hadria	211	“ Man 's eternal reply to woman , admirably paraphrased ! ”
10089	10093	10086	10086	she	81	“ beastly obstinate . ”
10208	10219	10220	10220	she	81	“ I do n't want to pose as a philanthropist , ”
10223	10330	10220	10220	she	81	“ though I honestly do desire to be of service . I want to spread my wings . And why should I not ? Nobody turns pale when Ernest wants to spread his . How do I know what life is like , or how best to use it , if I remain satisfied with my present ignorance ? How can I even appreciate what I possess , if I have nothing to compare it with ? Of course , the truly nice and womanly thing to do , is to remain at home , waiting to be married . I have elected to be unwomanly . ”
10331	10341	10343	10343	Ernest	86	“ I wonder how all this will turn out , ”
10345	10360	10343	10343	Ernest	86	“ whether you wo n't regret it some day when it is too late . ”
10361	10374	10376	10376	Hadria	211	“ Do n't people always regret what they do — some day ? ”
10378	10392	10376	10376	Hadria	211	“ Perhaps so , especially if they do it sooner than other people . ”
10393	10406	10408	10408	Fred	83	“ When are you going to make the announcement at head quarters ? ”
10431	10441	10423	10423	She	81	“ I shall speak to mother to - day . ”
10739	10750	10724	10724	they	364	“ Other married women always look such fools beside mother ! ”
10869	10879	10880	10880	she	567	“ No doubt it is all superstition and nonsense , ”
10885	10911	10880	10880	she	567	“ but in this country , one ca n't afford to fly in the face of prejudice . It would seriously tell against the girls . ”
10912	10920	10880	10880	she	567	“ Well , have your own way , ”
10926	10977	10880	10880	she	567	“ but I ca n't see the use of always bothering about what people will think . What more do the girls want than a good home and plenty of lawn - tennis ? They 'll get husbands fast enough , without your asphyxiating yourself every Sunday in their interests . ”
11038	11042	11049	11049	he	89	“ all nonsense , ”
11153	11156	11157	11158	Mr. Fullerton	89	“ Picturesque ! ”
11166	11179	11157	11158	Mr. Fullerton	89	“ why not say ‘ unhealthy ’ and be done with it ? ”
11325	11341	11343	11344	Mr. Fullerton	89	“ If you will provide the ditch - water , I will provide the microscope , ”
11413	11425	11427	11428	Mr. Fullerton	89	“ If Buchanan would only adopt my plan of destroying them , ”
11430	11440	11427	11428	Mr. Fullerton	89	“ we should soon get rid of the pest . ”
11441	11451	11453	11454	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ It 's some chemical , is n't it ? ”
11456	11478	11453	11454	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ Oh , no ; that 's no use at all ! Wasps positively enjoy chemicals . What you do is this—. ”
11816	11830	11832	11835	the man of science	608	“ When once the prejudice against a new thing has been got over , ”
11837	11851	11832	11835	the man of science	608	“ you will see — the thing will go like wild - fire . ”
11878	11883	11885	11886	her father	609	“ Well , Algitha , ”
11893	11920	11885	11886	her father	609	“ how are the roses getting on ? And I hope you have not forgotten the sweet - brier that you promised to grow for me . ”
11921	11936	11941	11941	her	81	“ Oh , no , father , the sweet - brier has been ordered , ”
11947	11953	11955	11956	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ Have you a headache ? ”
11958	12007	11955	11956	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ I hope you have not all been sitting up talking in Hadria 's room , as you are too fond of doing . You have the whole day in which to express your ideas , and I think you might let the remainder wait over till morning . ”
12008	12016	12017	12017	Algitha	81	“ We were rather late last night , ”
12020	12026	12028	12028	Fred	83	“ Pressure of ideas overpowering , ”
12030	12049	12051	12052	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ When I was young , ideas would never have been tolerated in young people for a moment , ”
12054	12087	12051	12052	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ it would have been considered a mark of ill - breeding . You may think yourselves lucky to be born at this end of the century , instead of the other . ”
12088	12093	12095	12095	Ernest	86	“ Indeed we do ! ”
12097	12104	12095	12095	Ernest	86	“ It 's getting jolly interesting ! “
12115	12120	12051	12052	Mrs. Fullerton	97	” observed his mother , “
12178	12179	12207	12207	one	329	” “
12191	12195	12207	12207	one	329	” said Ernest . “
12211	12212	12207	12207	one	329	” “
12223	12228	12217	12217	we	610	” said Mrs. Fullerton , “
12238	12389	12232	12232	we	610	” When luncheon was over , Mr. Fullerton went to the garden with his family , according to a time - honoured custom . His love of flowers sometimes made Hadria wonder whether her father also had been born with certain instincts , which the accidents of life had stifled or failed to develop . Terrible was the tyranny of circumstance ! What had Emerson been dreaming of ? Mr. Fullerton , with a rose - bud in his button - hole , went off with the boys for a farming walk . Mrs. Fullerton returned to the house , and the sisters were left pacing together in the sheltered old garden , between two rows of gorgeous autumn flowers . Hadria felt sick with dread of the coming interview . Algitha was buoyed up , for the moment , by a strong conviction that she was in the right . “
12409	12413	12414	12415	Other girls	622	” she said . “
12421	12422	12414	12415	Other girls	622	” “
12453	12454	12439	12441	The average woman	624	” “
12469	12471	12462	12462	I	0	” said Algitha—“morbid
12493	12514	12544	12551	one not see the bearings of the matter	628	” Both sisters were instinctively trying to buttress up Algitha 's courage , by strengthening her position with additional arguments . “
12519	12523	12544	12551	one not see the bearings of the matter	628	” Hadria asked , “
12553	12554	12544	12551	one not see the bearings of the matter	628	” “
12575	12576	12544	12551	one not see the bearings of the matter	628	” “
12589	12599	12601	12601	my	0	” exclaimed the younger sister , with sudden vehemence . “
12631	12632	12628	12629	the crowd	631	” “
12635	12658	12628	12629	the crowd	631	” cried Algitha , who had no sympathy with these passionate discouragements that alternated , in Hadria , with equally passionate exaltations . “
12707	12708	12709	12709	I	0	” “
12715	12723	12713	12713	you	632	” Algitha exclaimed with a dispirited laugh . “
12730	12734	12713	12713	you	632	” Hadria admitted ; “
12762	12763	12764	12764	I	0	” “
12770	12779	12767	12767	I	0	” cried Algitha , bending her fine head ; “
12786	12787	12790	12790	we	635	” “
12872	12873	12826	12826	she	636	” “
12879	12883	12826	12826	she	636	” said Algitha , “
13010	13011	12992	12993	a marionette	651	” “
13016	13041	12992	12993	a marionette	651	” said the younger sister , with a little raising of the brows , as if half shrinking from what she meant to say , “
13067	13116	13044	13045	most parents	653	” The sisters paced the length of the garden without speaking . Then Hadria came to a standstill at the sun - dial , at the crossing of the paths , and began absently to trace the figures of the hours , with the stalk of a rose . “
13120	13124	13125	13125	parents	620	” she said , “
13224	13225	13257	13257	I	0	” “
13231	13235	13257	13257	I	0	” said Algitha , “
13269	13270	13261	13261	them	606	” “
13275	13279	13261	13261	them	606	” cried Hadria , “
13339	13340	13341	13341	I	0	” “
13352	13356	13341	13341	I	0	” said Algitha , “
13405	13406	13403	13403	he	668	” “
13411	13448	13403	13403	he	668	” cried Hadria . While the momentous interview was going on , Hadria walked restlessly up and down the garden , feverishly waiting . The borders were brilliant with vast sunflowers , white lilies , and blazing “
13453	13536	13559	13559	I	0	” tangled together in splendid profusion , a very type of richness and glory of life . Such was the sort of existence that Hadria claimed from Fate . Her eyes turned to the bare , forlorn hills that even the August sunshine could not conjure into sumptuousness , and there she saw the threatened reality . When at last Algitha 's fine figure appeared at the further end of the path , Hadria hastened forward and took her sister 's arm . “
13545	13556	13557	13557	I	0	” Algitha said , with a quiver in her voice . “
13608	13609	13616	13616	Hadria	211	” “
13872	13879	13868	13868	she	3851	” Hadria 's face had clouded . “
13890	13894	13880	13881	Truly parents	677	” she exclaimed , “
13913	13921	13922	13922	Mother	3851	” Algitha was trembling and very pale . “
13958	13959	13942	13942	She	3851	” “
13976	13984	13985	13985	She	3851	” cried Hadria with a dispirited laugh . “
14012	14013	14000	14000	I	0	” “
14098	14106	14063	14063	They	654	” Hadria rose restlessly in her excitement . “
14145	14158	14159	14159	One	329	” Again there was a long silence , filled with painful thought . “
14194	14195	14190	14191	Mrs. Arbuthnot	104	” “
14201	14207	14190	14191	Mrs. Arbuthnot	104	” cried Algitha , flushing . “
14218	14219	14190	14191	Mrs. Arbuthnot	104	” “
14251	14267	14246	14246	I	0	” Hadria spoke with half - closed eyes that seemed to see deep and far . “
14309	14445	14450	14450	them	698	” In Hadria 's room that night , Algitha finally decided to delay her going for another six months , hoping by that time that her mother would have grown used to the idea , and less opposed to it . Mr. Fullerton dismissed it , as obviously absurd . But this high - handed treatment roused all the determination that Algitha had inherited from her father . The six months had to be extended , in order to procure funds . Algitha had a small income of her own , left her by her godmother , Miss Fortescue . She put aside this , for her purpose . Further delay , through Mrs. Trevelyan , brought the season round again to autumn , before Algitha was able to make her final preparations for departure . “
14455	14479	14450	14450	them	698	” she said to her sister , as they stood on the platform of Ballochcoil station , very white and wretched - looking . “
14522	14523	14524	14524	I	0	” “
14530	14534	14524	14524	I	0	” said Hadria , “
14550	14795	15219	15219	I	0	” There was not much time for farewells . In a few minutes the train was steaming out of the station . A solitary figure stood on the platform , watching the monster curving and diminishing along the line , with its white smoke soaring merrily into the air , in great rolling masses , that melted , as if by some incantation , from thick , snow - like whiteness to rapid annihilation . AS Hadria drove over the winding upland road back to her home , her thoughts followed her sister into her new existence , and then turned wistfully backwards to the days that had been marked off into the past by Algitha 's departure . How bright and eager and hopeful they had all been , how full of enthusiasm and generous ambitions ! Even as they talked of battle , they stretched forth their hands for the crown of victory . At the last meeting of the Preposterous Society , Ernest had repeated a poem of his favourite Emerson , called Days , and the poem , which was familiar to Hadria , sounded in her memory , as the pony trotted merrily along the well - known homeward way . In spite of Hadria 's memorable lecture of a year ago , it was still the orthodox creed of the Society , that Circumstance is the handmaid of the Will ; that one can demand of one 's days “
14805	15218	15219	15219	I	0	” and that the Days will obediently produce the objects desired . If one has but the spirit that can soar high enough to really be resolved upon stars , or the ambition sufficiently vaulting to be determined on kingdoms , then — so ran the dogma — stars and kingdoms would be forthcoming , though obstacles were never so determined . No member except Hadria had ever dreamt of insinuating that one might have a very pronounced taste for stars and kingdoms — nay , a taste so dominant that life would be worthless unless they were achieved — yet might be forced , by the might of events , to forego them . Hadria 's own heresy had been of the head rather than of the heart . But to - day , feeling began to share the scepticism of the intellect . What if one 's stars and kingdoms lay on the further side of a crime or a cruelty ? What then was left but to gather up one 's herbs and apples , and bear , as best one might , the scorn of the unjust Days ? Hadria cast about in her mind for a method of utilizing to the best advantage possible , the means at her disposal : to force circumstance to yield a harvest to her will . To be the family consolation meant no light task , for Mrs. Fullerton was exacting by nature : she had given much , and she expected much in return . Her logic was somewhat faulty , but that could not be gracefully pointed out to her by her daughter . Having allowed her own abilities to decay , Mrs. Fullerton had developed an extraordinary power of interfering with the employment of the abilities of others . Hadria had rather underrated than exaggerated this difficulty . Her mother would keep her for hours , discussing a trivial point of domestic business , giving elaborate directions about it , only to do it herself in the end . She spent her whole life in trifles of this kind , or over social matters . Everything was done cumbrously , with an incredible amount of toil and consideration , and without any noticeable results . Hadria , fighting against a multitude of harassing little difficulties , struggled to turn the long winter months to some use . But Mrs. Fullerton broke the good serviceable time into jagged fragments . “
15225	15254	15219	15219	I	0	” said the mother , when the daughter proposed to set apart certain hours for household duties , and to have other portions of the day to herself , “
15284	15624	15625	15626	Your father	705	” Hadria 's temper was far indeed from perfect , and painful scenes often occurred . But as a rule , she would afterwards be seized with a fit of remorse , knowing that her mother was suffering bitterly from her keen disappointment about Algitha . The failure of a life - long hope must try the endurance of the bravest . Mrs. Fullerton , seeing that Hadria was more patient , quickly took advantage of the favourable moment , with a rapid instinct that had often done her good service in the management of a niggard destiny . The valuable mood must not be allowed to die fruitless . The elder girl 's defection thus became , to the mother , a sort of investment , bearing interest of docility in the younger . Because the heartless Algitha had left home , it seemed to Mrs. Fullerton that the very least that Hadria could do , was to carry out her mother 's lightest wish . And so the weeks went by , in dreary , troublous fashion , cut into a hundred little barren segments . The mind had no space , or stretch , or solitude . It was incessantly harassed , and its impetus was perpetually checked . But Hadria hoped on . This could not last for ever . Some day , doubtless , if she sank not in spirit , the stars and the kingdoms would come . Meanwhile , the position of affairs was decidedly ridiculous . She was here as the family consolation , and nobody seemed to be consoled ! Her efforts had been sincere and even enthusiastic , but the boys only laughed at her , in this rôle , and nobody was apparently in the least gratified ( except those imps of boys ! ) . For a long time , Mrs. Fullerton seemed to be oblivious of her daughter 's efforts , but one day , when they had been talking about Algitha , the mother said : “
15671	16551	15664	15664	I	0	” Hadria felt a thrill of horror . The network of Fate seemed to be fast closing round her . The temporary was to become fixed . She must act all her days according to the conviction of others , or her parents would die of grief ! When she went to the hills that afternoon , she felt as if she must walk on and on into the dreamy distance , away from all these toils and claims , away into the unknown world and never return . But , alas ! the night descended and return she must . These wild impulses could never be followed . The day had been peculiarly harassing and cut up ; some neighbours had been to afternoon tea and tennis , and the sight of their faces and the sound of their talk had caused , in Hadria , an unutterable depression . The light , conventional phrases rang in her ears still , the expression of the faces haunted her , and into her heart crept a chill that benumbed every wish and hope and faith that she had ever cherished . She sat up late into the night . Since freedom and solitude could not be had by day , the nights were often her sole opportunity . At such times she would work out her musical ideas , which in the dead silence of the house were brought forth plentifully . These , from her point of view , were the fruitful hours of the twenty - four . Thoughts would throng the darkness like swarms of living things . Hadria 's mood found expression to - night in a singular and most melancholy composition . She called it Futility . It was unlike anything that she had ever done before , and she felt that it shewed an access of musical power . She dreamt an absurd dream : That she was herself one of those girls with the high pattering accents , playing tennis without ceasing and with apparent cheerfulness ; talking just as they had talked , and about just the same things ; and all the time , a vast circle of shadowy forms stood watching , beckoning , and exhorting and warning , and turning away , at last , in sorrowful contempt , because she preferred to spend her youth eternally in futilities . And then they all slowly drifted by with sad eyes fixed on her , and she was still left playing , playing . And it seemed as if whole weeks passed in that way , and she grew mortally tired , but some power prevented her from resting . The evil spell held her enthralled . Always cheerful , always polite and agreeable , she continued her task , finding herself growing accustomed to it at last , and duly resigned to the necessity , wearisome though it was . Then all hope that the game would ever cease went away , and she played on , mechanically , but always with that same polite cheerfulness , as of afternoon calls . She would not for the world admit that she was tired . But she was so tired that existence became a torture to her , and her heart seemed about to break with the intolerable strain — when she woke up with a start , and found herself lying in a constrained attitude , half - choked by the bed - clothes . She did not see the comic side of the dream till next morning , when she told it at breakfast for the benefit of the family . As Hadria was an ardent tennis - player , it struck her brethren as a particularly inappropriate form of nightmare . Hadria , at this time , went frequently with her father on his farming walks , as he liked to have one or more of the family with him . She enjoyed these walks , for Mr. Fullerton would talk about philosophy and science , often of the most abstruse and entrancing kind . His children were devoted to him . During these expeditions , they always vied with one another to ferret out the most absurd story to tell him , he being held as conqueror who made their father laugh most heartily . Sometimes they all went in a body , armed with wild stories ; and occasionally , across the open fields , a row of eccentric - looking figures might be seen , struggling in the grip of hilarious paroxysms ; Mr. Fullerton doubled up in the middle of a turnip - field , perhaps , with his family in contortions round him . The air of the hills seemed to run to their heads , like wine . Roulades of laughter , hearty guffaws , might have been heard for surprising distances , much to the astonishment of the sober labourers bending over their toil . Ernest had to go back to college ; Fred and Austin to school . The house seemed very quiet and sad after the boys left , and Hadria missed her sister more and more , as time went on . Algitha wrote most happily . “
16747	17388	16738	16738	I	0	” It was Hadria 's habit still to take solitary rambles over the country . A passionate lover of Nature , she found endless pleasure in its ever - changing aspects . Yet of late , a new feeling had begun to mutter angrily within her : a resentment against these familiar sights and sounds , because they were the boundaries of her horizon . She hated the line of the round breezy hills where the row of fir - trees stood against the sky , because that was the edge of her world , and she wanted to see what was beyond . She must and would see what was beyond , some day . Her hope was always vague ; for if she dared to wonder how the curtain of life was to be lifted , she had to face the fact that there was no reasonable prospect of such a lifting . Still , the utter horror of living on always , in this fashion , seemed to prove it impossible . On one dim afternoon , when the sun was descending , Hadria 's solitary figure was noticed by a white - haired lady , presumably a tourist , who had stopped to ask a question of some farm labourers , working in a field . She ceased to listen to the information , on the subject of Dunaghee , that was given to her in a broad Scottish dialect . The whole scene , which an instant before had impressed her as one of beauty and peace , suddenly focussed itself round the dark figure , and grew sinister in its aspect . At that moment , nothing would have persuaded the onlooker that the hastening figure was not hastening towards misfortune . A woman of impulse , she set off in purposeless pursuit . Hadria 's pace was very rapid ; she was trying to outrun thought . It was impossible to live without hope , yet hope , in this forlorn land , was growing faint and tired . Her pursuer was a remarkable - looking woman , no longer young , with her prematurely white hair drawn up from her brow with a proud sweep that suited well her sharply defined features and her air of defiance . She was carelessly dressed after the prevailing fashion , and gave the impression of not having her life successfully in hand , but rather of being driven by it , as by a blustering wind , against her inclination . The impression which had seized her , a moment ago , deepened as she went . Something in the scene and the hastening figure roused a sense of dread . With her , an impression was like a spark to gunpowder . Her imagination blazed up . Life , in its most tragic aspect , seemed before her in the lonely scene , with the lonely figure , moving , as if in pursuit of a lost hope , towards the setting sun . If Hadria had not paused on the brow of the hill , it is unlikely that she would have been overtaken , but that pause decided the matter . The stranger seemed suddenly to hesitate , wondering , apparently , what she had done this eccentric thing for . Hadria , feeling a presence behind her , turned nervously round and gave a slight start . It was so rare to meet anybody on these lonely hills , that the apparition of a striking - looking woman with white hair , dark eyes , and a strange exalted sort of expression , gave a shock of surprise . As the lady had stopped short , Hadria supposed that she had lost her way , and wished to make some enquiries . “
17400	17410	16738	16738	I	0	” she asked , after a second 's pause . “
17498	17499	17481	17481	I	0	” “
17534	17540	17526	17526	I	0	” said Hadria , impulsively . “
17575	17576	17572	17572	I	0	” “
17582	17592	17577	17577	They	720	” Hadria assured her new acquaintance , somewhat imprudently . “
17602	17730	17595	17595	I	0	” said the latter , and they walked on together . Hadria related what she knew about the history of the house . Very scanty records had survived . It had obviously been one of the old Scottish strongholds , built in the lawless days when the country was plunged in feuds and chieftains lived on plunder . A few traditions lingered about it : among them that of a chief who had carried off , by force , the daughter of his bitterest enemy , in revenge for some deed of treachery . He had tortured her with insolent courtship , and then starved her to death in a garret in the tower , while her father and his followers assaulted its thick walls in vain . “
17760	17761	17595	17595	I	0	” “
17766	17767	17595	17595	I	0	” “
17795	17799	17800	17800	I	0	” Hadria remarked . “
17812	17817	17800	17800	I	0	” the other said ; “
17875	17885	17887	17887	you	0	” Hadria looked at her companion with startled interest . “
17899	17904	17887	17887	you	0	” the lady asked . “
17913	17914	17916	17916	you	0	” “
17968	17999	18000	18002	Miss Du Prel	109	” Hadria came to a sudden standstill . She might know it ! she might indeed . Valeria Du Prel had long been to her a name to swear by . “
18023	18032	18011	18011	I	0	” Miss Du Prel gave a gratified smile . “
18040	18041	18036	18036	they	729	” “
18063	18064	18056	18056	I	0	” “
18075	18076	18067	18067	my	0	” “
18118	18134	18135	18135	I	0	” Miss Du Prel seemed so genuinely pleased by this enthusiasm that Hadria was surprised . “
18191	18192	18194	18194	I	0	” “
18210	18214	18194	18194	I	0	” cried Hadria . “
18225	18367	18218	18218	you	0	” Miss Du Prel exclaimed . Hadria gazed incredulously at the familiar scene , as they approached the back of the house , with its round tower and its confusion of picturesque , lichen - covered roofs . An irregular circle of stately trees stood as sentinels round the stronghold . After all , something did happen , once in a while , in this remote corner of the universe , whose name , Hadria used to think , had been erased from the book of Destiny . She was perhaps vaguely disappointed to find that the author of Parthena wore ordinary human serge , and a cape cut after the fashion of any other person 's cape . Still , she had no idea what supersensuous material she could reasonably have demanded of her heroine ( unless it were the mythic “
18369	18399	18400	18400	You	731	” that Ernest used to talk about , in his ignorant efforts to describe female apparel ) , or what transcendental form of cape would have satisfied her imagination . “
18406	18412	18400	18400	You	731	” said Valeria Du Prel , “
18420	18421	18413	18413	you	731	” “
18428	18429	18423	18423	you	731	” “
18476	18649	18650	18650	You	736	” Hadria , without answering , led her companion round the flank of the tower , and up to the front door . It was situated in the angle of the wings , a sheltered nook , hospitably careful of the guest , whom the winds of the uplands were disposed to treat but roughly . Hadria and her companion entered a little panelled hall , whence a flight of broad stairs with stout wooden balusters , of quaint design , led to the first floor . The visitor was charmed with the quiet old rooms , especially with Hadria 's bedroom in the tower , whose windows were so deep - set that they had to be approached through a little tunnel cut out of the thickness of the wall . The windows looked on to the orchard at the back , and in front over the hills . Miss Du Prel was taken to see the scene of the tragedy , and the meeting - room of the Preposterous Society . “
18658	18809	18810	18810	Mother	103	” said Hadria . She opened a door as she spoke , and ushered her visitor into a large , finely - proportioned room with three tall windows of stately form , divided into oblong panes , against which vagrant sprays of ivy were gently tapping . This room was also panelled with painted wood ; its character was quiet and stately and reposeful . Yet one felt that many human lives had been lived in it . It was full of the sentiment of the past , from the old prints and portraits on the walls , to the delicate outlines of the wooden mantel - piece , with its finely wrought urns and garlands . Before this mantel - piece , with the firelight flickering in her face , sat Mrs. Fullerton , working at a large piece of embroidery . For the first time , Hadria hesitated . “
18812	18816	18810	18810	Mother	103	” she said , “
18849	18887	18833	18833	I	0	” Mrs. Fullerton had looked up in astonishment , at this incursion into her very sanctuary , of a stranger met at haphazard on the hills . Hadria wheeled up an easy - chair for the visitor . “
18904	18957	18890	18892	Miss Du Prel	109	” said Mrs. Fullerton , whose manner had grown rigid , partly because she was shy , partly because she was annoyed with Hadria for her impulsive conduct , and largely because she disliked the idea of a literary acquaintance for her daughter , who was quite extraordinary enough as it was . “
18966	19014	18958	18958	We	743	” said Hadria hastily , with an anxious glance at Miss Du Prel , whom she half expected to rise and walk out of the room . It must surely be the first time in her life that her presence had not been received as an honour ! ”
19015	19024	19026	19027	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ It is all very old and shabby , ”
19029	19059	19026	19027	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ I hope you will take some tea ; if you have walked far to - day , you must be cold and in need of something to eat . ”
19060	19069	19071	19072	the visitor	4013	“ Oh no , no , thank you , ”
19074	19087	19071	19072	the visitor	4013	“ I ought to be getting back to Ballochcoil to - night . ”
19088	19092	19094	19094	mother	3851	“ To Ballochcoil ! ”
19101	19127	19094	19094	mother	3851	“ But it is nearly seven miles off , and the sun is down . You ca n't get back to - night on foot . ”
19128	19152	19071	19072	the visitor	4013	“ Dear me , can I not ? I suppose I forgot all about getting back , in the interest of the scenery . ”
19153	19159	19161	19162	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ What an extraordinary person ! ”
19191	19223	19094	19094	mother	3851	“ Dear me , how dark it has grown ! Still I think I can walk it , or perhaps I can get a fly at some inn on the way . ”
19224	19232	19234	19235	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ Can we offer you a carriage ? ”
19237	19293	19234	19235	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ Oh no , thank you ; that is quite unnecessary . I have already intruded far too long ; I shall wend my way back , or what might perhaps be better , I could get a lodging at the farmhouse down the road . I am told that they put travellers up sometimes . ”
19467	19535	19437	19438	Mrs. McEwen	111	“ I CANNOT make you realize that you are an ignorant girl who knows nothing of the world , and that it is necessary you should accept my experience , and condescend to be guided by my wishes . You put me in a most unpleasant position this afternoon , forcing me to receive a person whom I have never been introduced to , or heard of — ”
19536	19551	19553	19553	Hadria	211	“ Valeria Du Prel has been heard of throughout the English - speaking world , ”
19556	19562	19564	19565	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ So much the worse , ”
19567	19582	19564	19565	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ No nicely brought up woman is ever heard of outside her own circle . ”
19602	19642	19583	19583	Hadria	211	“ She might have been some awful person , some unprincipled adventuress , and that I believe is what she is . What was she prowling about the back of our house for , I should like to know ? ”
19643	19654	19655	19655	Hadria	211	“ I suspect she wanted to steal chickens or something , ”
19731	19740	19742	19743	Mrs. McEwen	111	“ She seems a nice - like body , ”
19745	19755	19742	19743	Mrs. McEwen	111	“ and I see no objection to the arrangement . ”
19815	19833	19796	19796	she	109	“ I wanted to know if you were comfortable , if I could do anything for you . ”
19840	19900	19834	19836	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Oh no , thank you ; you are very kind . I am most comfortable — at least — it is very strange , but I have lost my keys and my umbrella and my hand - bag - I ca n't think what I can have done with them . Oh , and my purse is gone too ”
19950	20099	19902	19903	Mrs. McEwen	111	” and about which she had long since abandoned hope . She received them with mingled joy and amazement , and having responded to Mrs. McEwen 's questions as to what she would like for dinner , she proposed to Hadria that they should take a walk together . Hadria beamed . Miss Du Prel seemed both amused and gratified by her companion 's worship , and the talk ran on , in a light and pleasant vein , differing from the talk of the ordinary mortal , Hadria considered , as champagne differs from ditch - water . In recording it for Algitha 's benefit that evening , Hadria found that she could not reproduce the exhilarating quality , or describe the influence of Miss Du Prel 's personality . It was as if , literally , a private and particular atmosphere had encompassed her . She was “
20104	20243	19902	19903	Mrs. McEwen	111	” as her disciple asserted . Her love of Nature was intense . Hadria had never before realized that she had been without full sympathy in this direction . She awoke to a strange retrospective sense of solitude , feeling a new pity for the eager little child of years ago , who had wandered up to the garret , late at night , to watch the moonlight spread its white shroud over the hills . With every moment spent in the society of Valeria Du Prel , new and clearer light seemed to Hadria , to be thrown upon all the problems of existence ; not by any means only through what Miss Du Prel directly said , but by what she implied , by what she took for granted , by what she omitted to say . “
20255	20262	20263	20263	I	0	” Hadria wrote to her sister . “
20674	20909	20665	20666	the adversary	784	“ That ridiculous adversary , Harold Wilkins , is staying again at Drumgarren , and I hear from Mrs. Gordon that he thinks it very strange that I should see so much of so extraordinary a person as Miss Du Prel ! Opinions differ of course ; I think it very strange that the Gordons should see so much of so ordinary a person as Mr. Wilkins . Everybody makes much of him here , and , alas ! all the girls run after him , and even fall in love with him ; why , I ca n't conceive . For if driven by dire compulsion of fate , to bend one 's thoughts upon some prosaic example of that prosaic sex , why not choose one of the many far more attractive candidates available — the Gordons , the McKenzies , and so forth ? When I go to tennis parties with mother — they are still playing upon the asphalte courts — and see the little dramas that go on , the jealousies and excitements , and general much - ado - about - nothing , I can scarcely believe that Miss Du Prel really belongs to the same planet as ours . But I do n't feel so contemptuous as I did ; it is so pitiful . Out of my great wealth I can afford to be more generous . “
21012	21046	21049	21049	you	0	” The talks with Valeria Du Prel grew more intimate , and more deeply interesting to Hadria , every day . Miss Du Prel used often to look at her companion in amazement . “
21053	21060	21049	21049	you	0	” she exclaimed on one occasion . “
21083	21763	21070	21070	you	0	” She used to ponder over the problem , wondering what Professor Fortescue would say to it . There appeared to be more here than mere heredity could account for . But science had never solved this problem ; originality seemed always to enter upon its career , uncaused and unaccountable . It was ever a miraculous phenomenon . The Professor had always said so . Still the heritage was rich enough , in this case . Heredity might have some discoverable part in the apparent marvel . Each member of the Fullerton family had unusual ability of some kind . Their knowledge of science , and their familiarity with the problems of philosophy , had often astonished Miss Du Prel . Hadria 's accounts of the Preposterous Society made her laugh and exclaim at the same moment . She gave an envious sigh at the picture of the eager little group , with their warmth of affection for one another , and their vivid interests . Miss Du Prel , with all her sadness , was youthful in spirit . Hadria found her far younger than many girls of her own age . This set her thinking . She observed how rigid most people become in a few years , and how the personality grows wooden , in the daily repetition of the same actions and the same ideas . This stiffening process had been attributed to the malice of Time ; but now Hadria began to believe that narrow and ungenerous thought lay at the root of the calamity . The entire life of the little world in which she had grown up , on all its sides , in all its ideals and sentiments , stood before her , as if some great painter had made a picture of it . She had never before been able to stand so completely apart from the surroundings of her childhood . And she was able to do so now , not because Miss Du Prel discoursed about it , but because Hadria 's point of view had shifted sympathetically to the point of view of her companion , through the instinctive desire to see how these familiar things would look to alien eyes . That which had seemed merely prosaic and dreary , became characteristic ; the very things which she had taken most for granted were exactly those which turned out to be the significant and idiomatic facts . These had made permanent inroads into the mind and character . It was with these that Hadria would have to reckon all her days , under whatever conditions she might hereafter be placed . Daily surroundings were not merely pleasant or unpleasant facts , otherwise of no importance ; they were the very material and substance of character ; the push and impetus , or the let and hindrance ; the guardians or the assassins of the soul . MISS DU PREL had promised to allow Hadria to drive her to Darachanarvan , a little town on the banks of the river , about seven miles across country . Hadria was in high spirits , as they trundled along the white roads with the wind in their faces , the hills and the blue sky spread out before them , the pleasant sound of the wheels and the trotting of the pony setting their thoughts to rhythm . The trees were all shedding their last yellow leaves , and the air was full of those faded memories of better days , whirling in wild companies across the road , rushing upward on the breast of some vagabond gust , drifting , spinning , shuddering along the roadside , to lie there at last , quiet , among a host of brothers , with little passing tremors , as if ( said Valeria ) they were silently sobbing because of their banishment from their kingdom of the air . Miss Du Prel , though she enjoyed the beauty of the day and the scenery , seemed sad of mood . “
21771	21775	21070	21070	you	0	” she said . “
21850	21851	21827	21827	I	0	” “
21860	21861	21827	21827	I	0	” “
21877	21950	21827	21827	I	0	” she said . She paused for a moment , and then she fell into one of her exalted moods , when she seemed to lose consciousness of the ordinary conditions around her , or rather to pierce deeper into their significance and beauty . Her speech would , at such times , become rhythmic and picturesque ; she evidently saw vivid images before her , in which her ideas embodied themselves . “
22125	22147	22148	22148	Yours	800	” They entered a little beech - wood , whose leaves made a light of their own , strange and mystical . “
22156	22160	22148	22148	Yours	800	” said Hadria . “
22171	22191	22163	22163	I	0	” answered Miss Du Prel , stirred by the intoxication of the motion and the wind and the sunlight , “
22213	22214	22215	22215	You	800	” “
22218	22222	22215	22215	You	800	” said Hadria . “

22271	22275	22264	22269	those who live in your neighbourhood	801	” said Hadria . “
22303	22304	22305	22305	One	329	” “
22322	22326	22305	22305	One	329	” said Hadria . “
22334	22347	22305	22305	One	329	” cried Valeria , looking round at the glowing face beside her . “
22354	22358	22359	22359	I	0	” said Hadria . “
22369	22370	22359	22359	I	0	” “
22377	22381	22372	22372	I	0	” she answered . “
22394	22404	22382	22382	One	329	” Hadria was silent . The words sounded ominous . “
22411	22417	22382	22382	One	329	” she said at length . “
22435	22436	22419	22419	you	800	” “
22487	22572	22573	22573	I	0	” Again the sound of the pony 's hoofs sounded through the silence , in a cheerful trot upon the white roads . They were traversing an open , breezy country , chequered with wooded hollows , where generally a village sought shelter from the winds . And these patches of foliage were golden and red in the meditative autumn sunshine , which seemed as if it were a little sad at the thought of parting with the old earth for the coming winter . “
22584	22588	22589	22589	I	0	” said Hadria . “

22731	22732	22724	22727	an observant young woman	808	” “
22743	22745	22740	22740	you	810	” said Hadria—“preached

22882	22888	22876	22876	they	3687	” Miss Du Prel smiled . “
22893	22897	22876	22876	they	3687	” she admitted . “
22913	22914	22876	22876	they	3687	” “
22920	22924	22876	22876	they	3687	” Hadria quoted . “
22936	22943	22931	22931	you	0	” cried Valeria , much amused . “
23074	23075	23098	23098	she	826	” “
23083	23087	23098	23098	she	826	” echoed Hadria . “
23117	23118	23119	23121	Some dull spirit	828	” “
23123	23124	23119	23121	Some dull spirit	828	” “

23173	23179	23166	23166	she	832	” exclaimed Miss Du Prel . “
23185	23394	23181	23181	she	832	” replied Hadria demurely . They were spinning down hill now , into a warm bit of country watered by the river , and Hadria drew rein . The spot was so pleasant that they alighted , tied the pony to a tree , and wandered over the grass to the river 's edge . Hadria picked her way from stone to slippery stone , into the middle of the river , where there was comparatively safe standing room . Here she was suddenly inspired to execute the steps of a reel , while Valeria stood dismayed on the bank , expecting every moment , to see the dance end in the realms of the trout . But Hadria kept her footing , and continued to step it with much solemnity . Meanwhile , two young men on horseback were coming down the road ; but as a group of trees hid it from the river at this point , they were not noticed . The horsemen stopped suddenly when they cleared the group of trees . The figure of a young woman in mid - stream , dancing a reel with extreme energy and correctness , and without a smile , was sufficiently surprising to arrest them . “
23399	23403	23396	23396	I	0	” exclaimed Hadria , “
23409	23410	23406	23407	Harold Wilkins	94	” “
23421	23460	23411	23411	I	0	” said Valeria . Hadria , who had known the young man since her childhood , waited calmly as he turned his horse 's head towards the river , and advanced across the grass , raising his hat . “
23467	23468	23464	23465	Miss Fullerton	112	” “
23472	23480	23481	23481	You	833	” Hadria returned , from her rock . “
23493	23494	23481	23481	You	833	” “
23503	23711	23498	23498	you	833	” Mr. Wilkins was noted , far and wide , for his dancing , and the question was wounding . He was tall and loosely built , with brown expressionless eyes , dark hair , a pink complexion , shelving forehead , and a weak yet obstinate mouth . His companion also was tall and dark , but his face was pale , his forehead broad and high , and a black moustache covered his upper lip . He had raised his hat gracefully on finding that the dancer in mid - stream was an acquaintance of his companion , and he shewed great self - possession in appearing to regard the dancing of reels in these circumstances , as an incident that might naturally be expected . Not a sign of surprise betrayed itself in the face , not even a glimmer of curiosity . Hadria was so tickled by this finished behaviour under difficulties , that she took her cue from it , and decided to treat the matter in the same polished spirit . She too would take it all decorously for granted . Mr. Wilkins introduced his friend : Mr. Hubert Temperley . Hadria bowed gracefully in reply to Mr. Temperley 's salute . “
23722	23727	23714	23714	you	834	” asked Mr. Wilkins . “
23733	23740	23714	23714	you	834	” cried Hadria in mock surprise . “
23757	23758	23760	23760	you	834	” “
23775	23776	23760	23760	you	834	” “
23780	23784	23778	23778	you	834	” replied Hadria . “
23809	23848	23881	23881	woman	3844	” and she hurried her friend away . They were conducted to the pony - cart by the cavaliers , who raised their hats , as the ladies drove off at a merry pace , bowing their farewells . “
23853	23866	23881	23881	woman	3844	” Temperley exclaimed , as they turned the corner of the road . “
23873	23878	23879	23879	Woman	3844	” Harold Wilkins enquired . “
23883	23944	23881	23881	woman	3844	” Temperley replied , a little impatiently . He had not found young Wilkins quick to catch his meaning during the two hours ' ride , and it occurred to him that Miss Fullerton would have been a more interesting companion . He made a good many enquiries about her and her family , on the way back to Drumgarren . “
23958	23962	23881	23881	woman	3844	” said Harold , “
23987	23988	23991	23991	you	0	” “
24009	24010	23999	23999	I	0	” “
24029	24030	24017	24017	I	0	” “
24040	24044	24032	24032	you	0	” said Temperley , “
24057	24058	24053	24055	a charming fellow	846	” “
24064	24068	24053	24055	a charming fellow	846	” cried Harold . “
24086	24090	24091	24091	You	0	” Temperley laughed . “
24124	24125	24103	24103	I	0	” “
24147	24148	24134	24134	you	0	” “
24157	24161	24151	24151	I	0	” Temperley admitted . “
24177	24178	24179	24179	You	0	” “
24196	24201	24191	24191	she	211	” said Harold Wilkins . “
24204	24211	24191	24191	she	211	” cried Temperley with new interest . “
24227	24228	24223	24223	she	211	” “
24263	24264	24255	24255	She	211	” “
24287	24510	24280	24280	her	211	” Meanwhile , the occupants of the pony - cart had arrived at Darachanarvan , where they were to put up the pony and have luncheon . It was a prosaic little Scottish town , with only a beautiful survival , here and there , from the past . After luncheon , they wandered down to the banks of the river , and watched the trout and the running water . Hadria had long been wishing to find out what her oracle thought about certain burning questions on which the sisters held such strong , and such unpopular sentiments , but just because the feeling was so keen , it was difficult to broach the subject . An opportunity came when Miss Du Prel spoke of her past . Hadria was able to read between the lines . When a mere girl , Miss Du Prel had been thrown on the world — brilliant , handsome , impulsive , generous — to pass through a fiery ordeal , and to emerge with aspirations as high as ever , but with her radiant hopes burnt out . But she did not dwell on this side of the picture ; she emphasized rather , the possibility of holding on through storm and stress to the truth that is born in one ; to belief in “
24531	24587	24588	24588	You	851	” But she gave no encouragement to certain of her companion 's most vehement sentiments . She seemed to yearn for exactly that side of life from which the younger shrank with so much horror . She saw it under an entirely different aspect . Hadria felt thrown back on herself , lonely once more . “
24594	24600	24591	24592	Mrs. Gordon	91	” she said at length , “
24608	24609	24603	24603	you	851	” “
24618	24619	24603	24603	you	851	” “
24631	24632	24622	24622	she	91	” “
24659	24660	24650	24650	she	3753	” “
24684	24718	24670	24670	I	0	” Miss Du Prel failed to see what there was so very dreadful in Mrs. Gordon 's lot . She had , perhaps , rather more children than was necessary , but otherwise — “
24725	24729	24670	24670	I	0	” cried Hadria , “
24745	24746	24747	24747	I	0	” “
24755	24761	24752	24752	you	0	” said Miss Du Prel . “
24765	24766	24752	24752	you	0	” “
24800	24809	24858	24858	you	0	” Valeria studied her companion 's excited face . “
24821	24826	24811	24811	you	0	” she asked curiously . “
24843	24855	24858	24858	you	0	” replied Hadria , turning uneasily away from the close scrutiny . “
24888	24896	24865	24865	you	0	” Miss Du Prel 's interest quickened . “
24932	24933	24919	24922	another woman in England	862	” “
24952	24953	24949	24949	they	860	” “
24982	24983	24980	24980	mothers	865	” “
24990	24994	24980	24980	mothers	865	” assented Hadria . “
25039	25040	25032	25032	one	329	” “
25053	25057	25032	25032	one	329	” said Hadria , “

25114	25120	25092	25093	Mrs. Gordon	91	” Miss Du Prel admitted , “
25156	25157	25206	25206	Hadria	211	” “
25177	25181	25220	25220	she	120	” said Hadria , “
25194	25195	25220	25220	she	120	” “
25324	25336	25337	25337	One	329	” Hadria moved restlessly to and fro by the river bank . “
25353	25357	25342	25342	oneself	329	” she said , “
25452	25453	25454	25454	You	871	” “
25458	25464	25454	25454	You	871	” cried Miss Du Prel . “
25476	25477	25454	25454	You	871	” “
25533	25534	25539	25539	you	871	” “
25573	25574	25542	25542	you	871	” “
25589	25597	25539	25539	you	871	” returned Hadria , with suppressed passion . “
25610	25616	25604	25604	you	871	” prophesied Miss Du Prel . “
25658	25659	25660	25660	My	0	” “
25666	25667	25660	25660	My	0	” “
25796	25803	25804	25804	You	871	” Miss Du Prel remained silent . “
25809	25815	25804	25804	You	871	” she said at last ; “
25821	25822	25823	25825	Miss Du Prel	109	” “
25852	25853	25857	25857	you	871	” “
25863	25864	25857	25857	you	871	” “
25922	25923	25908	25920	a woman who refuses the path that has been marked out for her	894	” “
25944	25945	25942	25942	women	606	” “
25948	25952	25942	25942	women	606	” said Hadria , “
26002	26003	25942	25942	women	606	” “
26016	26022	25942	25942	women	606	” Miss Du Prel admitted . “
26031	26039	26023	26023	I	0	” she went on after a pause , “
26067	26068	26055	26055	One	329	” “
26083	26084	26070	26070	you	899	” “
26093	26094	26070	26070	you	899	” “
26109	26110	26097	26097	you	899	” “

26153	26154	26141	26141	I	0	” “
26157	26163	26141	26141	I	0	” said Hadria , laughing , “
26180	26197	26164	26164	you	899	” Miss Du Prel could not honestly deny this possibility . After a pause she said : “
26298	26299	26251	26251	their	906	” “
26306	26327	26251	26251	their	906	” said Hadria , moving close to the river 's brink , and casting two big stones into the current . “
26337	26338	26339	26339	You	899	” “
26351	26357	26339	26339	You	899	” said Miss Du Prel . “
26363	26367	26359	26359	I	0	” cried Hadria . “
26374	26381	26368	26368	I	0	” The other shook her head . “
26401	26434	26446	26448	Miss Du Prel	109	“ I would not purchase it at such a cost . If I ca n't have it without despoiling myself of everything that is worth possessing , I prefer to go without . ”
26435	26444	26446	26448	Miss Du Prel	109	“ You do n't know what you say ! ”
26450	26494	26446	26448	Miss Du Prel	109	“ But why ? Love would be ruined and desecrated . I understand by it a sympathy so perfect , and a reverence so complete , that the conditions of ordinary domestic existence would be impossible , unthinkable , in connection with it . ”
26495	26558	26446	26448	Miss Du Prel	109	“ So do I understand love . But it comes , perhaps , once in a century , and if one is too fastidious , it passes by and leaves one forlorn : at best , it comes only to open the gates of Paradise , for a moment , and to close them again , and leave one in outer darkness . ”
26559	26562	26446	26448	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Always ? ”
26563	26568	26570	26572	Miss Du Prel	109	“ I believe always , ”
26587	26590	26592	26592	Hadria	211	“ Well , ”
26604	26641	26592	26592	Hadria	211	“ one can not do better than follow one 's own instinct and thought of the moment . Regret may come , do what one may . One can not escape from one 's own temperament . ”
26642	26648	26446	26448	Miss Du Prel	109	“ One can modify it . ”
26649	26711	26750	26750	she	211	“ I can not even wish to modify mine , so that I should become amenable to these social demands . I stand in hopeless opposition to the scheme of life that I have grown up amongst , to the universal scheme of life indeed , as understood by the world up to this day . Audacious , is it not ? ”
26712	26717	26719	26721	Miss Du Prel	109	“ I like audacity , ”
26723	26736	26719	26721	Miss Du Prel	109	“ As I understand you , you require an altogether new dispensation ! ”
26775	26784	26750	26750	she	211	“ Yes , I require a new dispensation . ”
26886	26891	26892	26892	Hadria	211	“ and almost intelligent , ”
26990	27004	27005	27005	he	118	“ I hear that you not only perform but compose , Miss Fullerton , ”
27008	27055	27005	27005	he	118	“ As soon as I heard that , I felt that I must make your acquaintance . My friends , the Gordons , are very charming , but they do n't understand a note of music , and I am badly off for a kindred spirit . ”
27056	27065	27066	27066	Hadria	211	“ My composing is a very mild affair , ”
27069	27077	27066	27066	Hadria	211	“ I suppose you are more fortunate . ”
27078	27161	27005	27005	he	118	“ Not much . I am pretty busy you see . I have my profession fession . I play a good deal — the piano and the ' cello are my instruments . But my difficulty is to find someone to accompany me . My sister does when she can , but of course with a house and family to look after — I am sometimes selfish enough to wish she had not married . We used to be such good friends . ”
27162	27168	27005	27005	he	118	“ Is that all over ? ”
27169	27182	27184	27184	Temperley	118	“ It is different . She always manages to be busy now , ”
27276	27279	27281	27282	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ Hadria ! ”
27288	27311	27281	27282	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ How could you ask Cecilia Gordon to play with young McKenzie ? You know their families are not on speaking terms ! ”
27349	27365	27366	27366	she	211	“ How does Miss Gordon manage to be energetic and chilling at the same time ! ”
27404	27413	27415	27416	Mrs. Gordon	91	“ Oh , Hadria , how could you ? ”
27540	27546	27548	27548	Hadria	211	“ I am so sorry , ”
27550	27578	27548	27548	Hadria	211	“ the quarrel went clean out of my head . They are so well matched . But your sister - in - law will never forgive me . ”
27579	27605	27535	27535	she	91	“ Oh , well , never mind , my dear ; it is your way , I know . Only of course it is awkward . ”
27606	27620	27535	27535	she	91	“ What can be done ? Shall I run in and separate them ? ”
27621	27630	27548	27548	Hadria	211	“ Oh , Hadria , you are ridiculous ! ”
27631	27639	27640	27640	she	91	“ I was not meant for society , ”
27648	27661	27663	27664	Mrs. Gordon	91	“ Oh , you will soon get into the way of it , ”
27667	27674	27663	27664	Mrs. Gordon	91	“ I am afraid I shall . ”
27679	27700	27675	27676	Mrs. Gordon	91	“ Mr. Temperley , I can never make out what Miss Fullerton really means . Do see if you can . ”
27701	27713	27663	27664	Mrs. Gordon	91	“ How could I expect to succeed where you have failed ? ”
27714	27728	27730	27732	the lady archly	927	“ Oh , you men are so much cleverer than we poor women , ”
27906	27916	27918	27919	Mrs. Gordon	91	“ How very handsome Hadria is looking this afternoon , ”
27921	27931	27918	27919	Mrs. Gordon	91	“ and how becoming that dark green gown is . ”
27936	27962	27932	27933	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ Yes , she does look her best to - day . I think she has been improving , of late , in her looks . ”
27963	27989	27990	27992	Miss Du Prel	109	“ That 's just what we have all noticed . There is so much animation in her face ; she is such a sweet girl . ”
28026	28033	28035	28036	the latter	590	“ Ah , Miss Du Prel , ”
28038	28058	28035	28036	the latter	590	“ I am so glad to see you at large again . I was afraid you were getting bored . ”
28059	28063	28065	28067	Miss Du Prel	109	“ I was , ”
28070	28076	28077	28079	The young men	940	“ so I came away . ”
28082	28094	28096	28096	Hadria	211	“ If only everybody could go away when he was bored , ”
28098	28115	28096	28096	Hadria	211	“ how peaceful it would be , and what small tennis - parties one would have ! ”
28116	28126	28128	28129	Hubert Temperley	118	“ Always excepting tennis - parties at this house , ”
28131	28141	28143	28145	Miss Du Prel	109	“ I do n't think any house would survive , ”
28147	28169	28143	28145	Miss Du Prel	109	“ If people do not meet to exchange ideas , I ca n't see the object of their meeting at all . ”
28170	28176	28178	28178	Temperley	118	“ What a revolutionary sentiment ! ”
28182	28192	28178	28178	Temperley	118	“ Where would society be , on that principle ? ”
28399	28413	28414	28414	he	118	“ A vast deal of nonsense is talked in the name of philosophy , ”
28440	28484	28414	28414	he	118	“ People seem to think that they have only to quote Spencer or Huxley , or take an interest in heredity , to justify themselves in throwing off all the trammels , as they would regard them , of duty and common sense . ”
28485	28493	28495	28497	Miss Du Prel	109	“ I have not observed that tendency , ”
28499	28529	28495	28497	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Really . I regret to say that I notice everywhere a disposition to evade responsibilities which , in former days , would have been honestly and contentedly accepted . ”
28530	28537	28539	28541	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Our standards are all changing , ”
28543	28556	28539	28541	Miss Du Prel	109	“ It does not follow that they are changing for the worse . ”
28557	28574	28576	28576	Temperley	118	“ It seems to me that they are not so much changing , as disappearing altogether , ”
28579	28599	28576	28576	Temperley	118	“ especially among women . We hear a great deal about rights , but we hear nothing about duties . ”
28600	28613	28615	28617	Miss Du Prel	109	“ We are perhaps , a little tired of hearing about duties , ”
28619	28627	28628	28628	he	118	“ You admit then what I say , ”
28632	28647	28628	28628	he	118	“ Every woman wants to be Mary , and no one will be Martha . ”
28648	28656	28658	28660	Miss Du Prel	109	“ I make just the opposite complaint , ”
28662	28703	28658	28660	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Dear me , quite a different way of looking at it . I confess I have scant patience with these interfering women , who want to turn everything upside down , instead of quietly minding their duties at home . ”
28704	28715	28717	28719	Miss Du Prel	109	“ I know it is difficult to make people understand , ”
28724	28735	28737	28737	Temperley	118	“ I should esteem it a favour to be enlightened , ”
28739	28817	28737	28737	Temperley	118	“ You were just now condemning socialism , Mr. Temperley , because you say that it attempts to ignore the principle of the division of labour . Now , when you lose patience with the few women who are refusing to be Marthas , you ignore that principle yourself . You want all women to do exactly the same sort of work , irrespective of their ability or their bent of mind . May I ask why ? ”
28818	28835	28837	28837	Temperley	118	“ Because I consider that is the kind of work for which they are best fitted , ”
28840	28910	28837	28837	Temperley	118	“ Then you are to be judge and jury in the case ; your opinion , not theirs , is to decide the matter . Supposing I were to take upon myself to judge what you were best fitted for , and were to claim , therefore , to decide for you what sort of life you should live , and what sort of work you should undertake — ? ”
28911	28925	28927	28927	Temperley	118	“ I should feel every confidence in resigning myself to your able judgment , ”
28939	28942	28943	28943	she	109	“ Ah , ”
28946	28966	28943	28943	she	109	“ you are at present , on the conquering side , and can afford to jest on the subject . ”
28967	28979	28980	28980	he	118	“ It is no joke to jest with an able woman , ”
28983	29034	28980	28980	he	118	“ Seriously , I have considerable sympathy with your view , and no wish to treat it flippantly . But if I am to treat it seriously , I must admit frankly that I think you forget that , after all , Nature has something to say in this matter . ”
29101	29116	29118	29118	Temperley	118	“ I often think that modern women might take example from these little creatures , ”
29139	29192	29118	29118	Temperley	118	“ They never attempt to shirk their lowly tasks on the plea of higher vocations . Not one turns from the path marked out by our great Mother , who also teaches her human children the same lesson of patient duty ; but , alas ! by them is less faithfully obeyed . ”
29193	29207	29209	29211	Miss Du Prel	109	“ If our great Mother wanted instinct she should not have bestowed reason , ”
29302	29310	29284	29284	she	109	“ pious devotion to other people 's duties ”
29324	29330	29318	29318	She	109	“ think for a moment . ”
29459	29469	29470	29470	she	109	“ Professor Fortescue , do n't you remember me ? ”
29501	29510	29495	29495	he	953	“ Miss Du Prel ! This is incredible ! ”
29525	29538	29540	29541	the Professor	4071	“ By what happy misunderstanding am I thus favoured by the gods ? ”
29550	29553	29555	29556	Professor Fortescue	116	“ Prodigious ! ”
29558	29583	29584	29584	He	953	“ Fate must have some strange plots in the making , unless indeed we fall to the discouraging supposition that she deigns to jest . ”
29756	29771	29773	29774	the Professor	4071	“ I can scarcely believe that it is ten years since I was here , ”
29788	29881	29773	29774	the Professor	4071	“ I used to visit my friends at Dunaghee every autumn , and now if some one were to assure me that I had been to sleep and dreamt a ten years ' dream , I should be disposed to credit it . Every detail the same ; the very cattle , the very birds — surely just those identical sparrows used to fly before me along the hedgerows , in the good old times , ten years ago ! Ah ! yes , it is only the human element that changes . ”
29882	29894	29895	29895	Temperley	118	“ One is often so thankful for a change in that , ”
29905	29908	29910	29912	Miss Du Prel	109	“ True , ”
29914	29946	29910	29912	Miss Du Prel	109	“ but what is so discouraging is that so often the charm goes , like the bloom of a peach , and only the qualities that one regrets remain and prosper . ”
29947	29962	29964	29965	the Professor	4071	“ I think people improve with time , as often as they fall off , ”
29973	29989	29967	29968	The others	303	“ To him that hath shall be given , but to him that hath not — ”
30003	30008	30009	30009	he	4071	“ Well , well , ”
30018	30136	30009	30009	he	4071	“ I ca n't say how happy I am to see you again . I have not yet got over my surprise . And so you have made the acquaintance of the family at Dunaghee . I have the warmest respect and affection for those dear folks . Mrs. Fullerton has the qualities of a heroine , kind hostess as she is ! And of what fine Scottish stuff the old man is made — and a mind like crystal ! What arguments we used to have in that old study of his ! I can see him now . And how genial ! A man could never forget it , who had once received his welcome . ”
30299	30310	30312	30315	one of the bystanders	984	“ Is that a son of the celebrated Judge Temperley ? ”
30317	30322	30324	30325	Mr. Gordon	93	“ His eldest son , ”
30327	30346	30324	30325	Mr. Gordon	93	“ a man who ought to make his mark , for he has splendid chances and good ability . ”
30347	30361	30362	30362	Temperley	131	“ I have scarcely had a word with you , the whole afternoon , ”
30384	30425	30381	30381	she	211	“ That is very sad ; but when one has social gatherings , one never does have a word with anybody . I think that must be the object of them — to accustom people to do without human sympathy . ”
30737	30774	30775	30775	He	4071	“ You mean to tell me that this is the little girl who used to take me for walks , and who had such an inordinate appetite for stories ! Good heavens , it is incredible ! ”
30791	30805	30807	30808	Mrs. Fullerton	97	“ They change so much at that age , in a short time , ”
30884	30889	30891	30892	the Professor	4071	“ Do you know , ”
30894	30954	30891	30892	the Professor	4071	“ I was turning into a French sweet - shop the other day , to buy my usual tribute for the children , when I suddenly remembered that they would no longer be children , and had to march out again , crestfallen , musing on the march of time and the mutability of things human — especially children . ”
30955	30960	30962	30963	Mr. Fullerton	89	“ It 's ridiculous , ”
30965	30983	30962	30963	Mr. Fullerton	89	“ I am always lecturing them about it , but they go on growing just the same . ”
30984	31016	30891	30892	the Professor	4071	“ And how they make you feel an old fogey before you know where you are ! And I thought I was quite a gay young fellow , upon my word ! ”
31017	31035	31037	31038	Mr. Fullerton	89	“ You , my dear Chantrey ! why you 'd be a gay young fellow at ninety ! ”
31048	31058	31059	31059	he	4071	“ And so this is really my little playfellow ! ”
31065	31180	31181	31181	he	4071	“ I remember her so well ; a queer , fantastic little being in those days , with hair like a black cloud , and eyes that seemed to peer out of the cloud , with a perfect passion of enquiry . She used to bewilder me , I remember , with her strange , wise little sayings ! I always prophesied great things from her ! Ernest , too , I remember : a fine little chap with curly , dark hair — rather like a young Italian , but with features less broadly cast ; drawn together and calmed by his northern blood . Yes , yes ; it seems but yesterday , ”
31191	31210	31181	31181	he	4071	“ and now my little Italian is at college , with a bored manner and a high collar . ”
31211	31223	31225	31225	Hadria	211	“ Oh , no ; Ernest 's a dear boy still , ”
31227	31249	31225	31225	Hadria	211	“ Oxford has n't spoilt him a bit . I do wish he was at home for you to see him . ”
31250	31266	31268	31269	Mr. Fullerton	89	“ Ah ! you must n't hint at anything against Ernest in Hadria 's presence ! ”
31276	31282	31284	31285	the Professor	4071	“ Not for the world ! ”
31287	31324	31284	31285	the Professor	4071	“ I was only recalling one or two of my young Oxford acquaintances . I might have known that a Fullerton had too much stuff in him to make an idiot of himself in that way . ”
31325	31333	31335	31336	Mr. Fullerton	89	“ The boy has distinguished himself too , ”
31338	31346	31348	31349	the mother	578	“ Everyone says he will do splendidly , ”
31351	31379	31348	31349	the mother	578	“ and you ca n't think how modest he is about himself , and how anxious to do well , and to please us by his success . ”
31380	31387	31388	31389	The Professor	4071	“ Ah ! that 's good . ”
31637	31646	31630	31630	His	1019	“ Do you remember that day when — ? ”
31665	31679	31681	31681	Hadria	211	“ We thought him a good and kind magician when we were children , ”
31685	31707	31681	31681	Hadria	211	“ and now one is grown up , there is no disillusion . He is a good and kind magician still . ”
31785	31789	31790	31790	Hadria	211	“ This man , ”
31802	31817	31793	31793	herself	211	“ is the best and the most generous human being I have ever met . ”
32061	32071	32072	32072	Temperley	118	“ However cultivated or charming a person may be , ”
32077	32096	32072	32072	Temperley	118	“ I never feel that I have found a kindred spirit , unless the musical instinct is strong . ”
32097	32100	32072	32072	Temperley	118	“ Nor I. ”
32101	32111	32072	32072	Temperley	118	“ Professor Fortescue has just that one weak point . ”
32112	32127	32072	32072	Temperley	118	“ Oh , but he is musical , though his technical knowledge is small . ”
32302	32335	32336	32336	You	1043	“ You can not imagine what it is , or perhaps you can imagine what it is to have the society of three such people as I now see almost every day . “
32576	32699	32567	32568	Mr. Temperley	118	“ You would have thought that when Miss Du Prel and Professor Fortescue arrived on the scene , I had about enough privileges ; but no , Destiny , waking up at last to her duties , remembers that I have a maniacal passion for music , and that this has been starved . So she hastens to provide for me a fellow maniac , a brother in Beethoven , who comes and fills my world with music and my soul with — But I must not rave . The music is still in my veins ; I am not in a fit state to write reasonable letters . Here comes Mr. Temperley for our practice . No more for the present . ”
32841	32850	32852	32852	Temperley	118	“ I think you would like my mother , ”
32860	32870	32854	32854	Hadria	211	“ And I am sure she would like you . ”
32871	32882	32852	32852	Temperley	118	“ On that point I can not offer an opinion . ”
32883	32892	32893	32893	he	118	“ Do n't you ever come to town ? ”
32896	32903	32904	32904	she	211	“ We go to Edinburgh occasionally , ”
32920	32936	32915	32915	He	118	“ No ; my father hates London , and mother never goes away without him . ”
32937	32951	33003	33004	the Professor	4071	“ What a pity ! But do you never visit friends in town ? ”
32952	32973	32915	32915	He	118	“ Yes ; my sister and I have spent one or two seasons in Park Lane , with some cousins . ”
32974	32993	32994	32999	The tête - a - tête	1061	“ Why , do n't you come this next season ? You ought to hear some good music . ”
33092	33109	33110	33110	he	116	“ To think that I should ever have dared to offer this young lady acidulated drops ! ”
33124	33135	33136	33136	she	211	“ Ah ! shall I ever forget those acidulated drops ! ”
33141	33156	33136	33136	she	211	“ You do n't mean to say that you would stoop to them now ? ”
33157	33171	33172	33172	she	211	“ It is not one 's oldest friends who always know one best , ”
33176	33182	33183	33183	he	116	“ I shall test you , ”
33646	33659	33660	33660	he	4071	“ I wonder what you like best , next to acidulated drops , ”
33674	33704	33660	33660	he	4071	“ There are few things in this wide world that can be mentioned in the same breath with them , but toffy also has its potency upon the spirit . ”
33705	33713	33668	33668	his	4071	“ I like not this mocking tone . ”
33714	33721	33722	33722	she	211	“ Then I will not mock , ”
33725	33730	33731	33731	he	4071	“ Yes , Hadria , ”
33736	33772	33731	33731	he	4071	“ you have grown up , if an old friend may make such remarks , very much as I expected , from the promise of your childhood . You used to puzzle me even then . ”
33773	33780	33781	33781	she	211	“ Do I puzzle you now ? ”
33784	33787	33731	33731	he	4071	“ Inexpressibly ! ”
33788	33795	33668	33668	his	4071	“ How amusing ! But how ? ”
33796	33853	33731	33731	he	4071	“ One can generally see at a glance , or pretty soon , the general trend of a character . But not with you . Nothing that I might hear of you in the future , would very much surprise me . I should say to myself , ‘ Yes , the germ was there . ’ ”
33859	33867	33854	33854	Hadria	211	“ Either good or bad you mean ? ”
33868	33871	33731	33731	he	4071	“ Well — ”
33872	33878	33879	33879	She	211	“ Yes , I understand . ”
33939	33949	33950	33950	she	211	“ You must have read some of my thoughts , ”
33953	33972	33950	33950	she	211	“ I often wonder how it is , that the world can drill women into goodness at all . ”
33988	34059	33975	33975	her	211	“ I often wonder why it is , that they do n't , one and all , fling up their rôles and revenge themselves to the best of their ability — intentionally , I mean — upon the world that makes them live under a permanent insult . I think , at times , that I should thoroughly enjoy spending my life in sheer , unmitigated vengeance , and if I did”—she
34067	34080	33975	33975	her	211	blazed—“if I did , I would not do my work by halves ! ”
34081	34089	34091	34092	the Professor	4071	“ I am sure you would not , ”
34095	34106	34107	34107	she	211	“ But I shall not do anything of the kind , ”
34114	34147	34107	34107	she	211	“ women do n't . They always try to be good , always , always — the more fools they ! And the more they are good , the worse things get . ”
34148	34164	34166	34167	the Professor	4071	“ Ah ! I thought there was some heterodox sentiment lurking here at high pressure ! ”
34172	34184	34185	34185	she	211	“ I have just been receiving good advice from Mrs. Gordon , ”
34193	34251	34185	34185	she	211	“ and I think if you knew the sort of counsel it was , that you would understand one 's feeling a little fierce and bitter . Oh , not with her , poor woman ! She meant it in kindness . But the most cutting thing of all is , that what she said is true ! ”
34252	34260	34262	34263	the Professor	4071	“ That is exactly the worst thing , ”
34298	34329	34290	34290	he	4071	“ Ah ! a woman ought to be born without pride , or not at all ! I wish to heaven that our fatal sex could be utterly stamped out ! ”
34342	34357	34358	34358	she	211	“ We are accused of being at the bottom of every evil under heaven , ”
34361	34378	34358	34358	she	211	“ and I think it is true . That is some consolation , at any rate ! ”
34424	34439	34440	34441	the Professor	4071	“ I have never in my life before ventured to interfere in such matters , ”
34448	34465	34440	34441	the Professor	4071	“ but if that fellow marries Hadria , one or both will live to rue it . ”
34466	34480	34481	34483	Miss Du Prel	109	“ I think it 's the best thing that could happen to her , ”
34486	34496	34498	34499	the Professor	4071	“ But they are not suited to one another , ”
34501	34508	34498	34499	the Professor	4071	“ Men and women seldom are ! ”
34509	34514	34515	34516	the Professor	4071	“ Then why — ? ”
34519	34530	34515	34516	the Professor	4071	“ He is about as near as she will get , ”
34534	34598	34531	34531	Valeria	109	“ I will never stand in the way of a girl 's marrying a good , honest man . There is not one chance in ten thousand that Hadria will happen to meet exactly the right person . I have made a mistake in my life . I shall do all in my power to urge her to avoid following in my footsteps . ”
34608	34622	34624	34626	Miss Du Prel	109	“ I pity Mr. Temperley , though I am so fond of Hadria , ”
34628	34641	34624	34626	Miss Du Prel	109	“ If he shatters her illusions , she will certainly shatter his . ”
34755	34758	34751	34751	He	4209	“ Oh ! ”
34801	34808	34810	34810	Hadria	211	“ Father is really too absurd ! ”
34812	34825	34810	34810	Hadria	211	“ there is no tragedy that he is incapable of roaring at ! ”
34826	34835	34837	34837	Temperley	118	“ I fear his daughter takes after him , ”
34917	34919	34922	34924	the meanest intelligence	1094	“ Engaged ”
34965	34973	34975	34975	Valeria	109	“ That foolish girl has refused him ! ”
34983	34987	34975	34975	Valeria	109	“ Thank heaven ! ”
34997	35007	34992	34992	Valeria	109	“ Why are you so anxious about the matter ? ”
35008	35023	35024	35024	Valeria	109	“ Because I know that a marriage between those two would end in misery . ”
35051	35064	35066	35066	Hadria	211	“ Better even that , than to grow old in uncongenial company , ”
35073	35083	35084	35084	she	109	“ One could go away when it became oppressive , ”
35092	35098	35089	35089	Hadria	211	“ What an ideal existence ! ”
35099	35109	35066	35066	Hadria	211	“ Are you still dreaming of an ideal existence ? ”
35110	35114	35089	35089	Hadria	211	“ Why not ? ”
35115	35123	35125	35127	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Well , dream while you may , ”
35129	35140	35125	35127	Miss Du Prel	109	“ My time of dreaming was the happiest of all . ”
35208	35215	35217	35217	Hadria	211	“ Why do you say that ? ”
35219	35279	35217	35217	Hadria	211	“ Because of the blundering , merciless way she has made us ; because of the needs that she has put into our hearts , and the preposterous payment that she demands for their fulfilment ; because of the equally preposterous payment she exacts , if we elect to do without that which she teaches us to yearn for . ”
35372	35391	35392	35392	he	4071	“ Heredity may be a powerful friend , or a bitter enemy , according as we treat her , ”
35395	35406	35408	35410	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Then our sex must have treated her very badly ! ”
35412	35432	35434	35435	the Professor	4071	“ Or our sex must have obliged yours to treat her badly , which comes to the same thing , ”
35500	35510	35511	35511	he	4071	“ I see it is a really bad attack , ”
35514	35527	35511	35511	he	4071	“ I sympathize . I have these inconsolable moods myself , sometimes . ”
35590	35599	35600	35600	he	4071	“ The contrast between them is so extraordinary , ”
35622	35650	35652	35652	Hadria	211	“ If only , they had not made such fools of their women , I should like to have lived at Athens in the time of Pericles ! ”
35654	35657	35659	35659	Valeria	109	“ I , ”
35661	35676	35659	35659	Valeria	109	“ would choose rather the Middle Ages , with their mysticism and their romance . ”
36089	36137	36066	36067	The minister	1118	“ Thou who hast given unto us , Thy servants , dominion over the beasts of the field and over every living thing , that they may serve us and minister unto us — rdquo ; Again , and more loudly , came the cry of distress . “
36148	36177	36138	36138	I	0	” exclaimed the Professor . At the moment , the howling suddenly ceased , and he paused . The minister was still appealing to his God for mercy . “
36192	36234	36183	36183	I	0	” and then there was a general prayer , in which the voices of the congregation joined . Some more singing and praying took place , before the sound of a sudden rush and movement announced the conclusion of the service . “
36240	36398	36183	36183	I	0	” said Miss Du Prel . They had no more than time to leave the porch , before the doors burst open , and the people streamed forth . A whiff of evil - smelling air issued from the building , at the same time . The dog was howling more piteously than ever . Someone complained of the disturbance that had been caused by the creature 's cries , during worship . The congregation continued to pour out , dividing into little groups to discuss the sermon or something of more mundane interest . An appearance of superhuman respectability pervaded the whole body . The important people , some of whom had their carriages waiting to drive them home , lingered a few moments , to exchange greetings , and to discuss sporting prospects or achievements . Meanwhile , one of the creatures over whom God had given them dominion , was wailing in vain appeal . “
36405	36415	36399	36399	I	0	” cried the Professor , and he started off . “
36421	36511	36416	36416	I	0	” Hadria announced . Miss Du Prel said that she could not endure the sight of suffering , and would await their return . And then occurred the incident that made this afternoon memorable to Hadria . In her last letter to her sister , she had said that she could not imagine the Professor contemptuous or angry . She had reason now to change her mind . His face was at once scornful and sad . For a moment , Hadria thought that he was displeased with her . “
36516	36532	36512	36512	I	0	” he said , with a scornful bitterness that she had not suspected in him , “
36684	36685	36677	36677	He	1146	” “
36689	36932	36677	36677	He	1146	” exclaimed Hadria . She drew a deep sigh of relief . Without precisely realizing the fact , she had been gradually sinking into an unformulated conviction that human beings are , at heart , ruthless and hard , as soon as they are brought beyond the range of familiar moral claims , which have to be respected on pain of popular censure . Self - initiated pity was nowhere to be found . The merciless coldness of many excellent people ( kind and tender , perhaps , within these accepted limits ) had often chilled her to the heart , and prompted a miserable doubt of the eventual victory of good over evil in the world , which her father always insisted was ruled by mere brute force , and would be so ruled to the end of time . She had tried to find a wider , more generous , and less conventional standard in her oracle , Miss Du Prel , but to her bitter disappointment , that lady had shrugged her shoulders a little callously , as soon as she was asked to extend her sympathy outside the circle of chartered candidates for her merciful consideration . Hadria 's hero - worship had suffered a severe rebuff . Now , as the Professor spoke , it was as if a voice from heaven had bidden her believe and hope fearlessly in her race , and in its destiny . “
36944	36948	36933	36933	I	0	” she said , “
36968	36969	36933	36933	I	0	” “
36979	36985	36933	36933	I	0	” said the Professor sadly . “
37015	37016	37017	37017	I	0	” “
37029	37157	37017	37017	I	0	” exclaimed Hadria . The incident proved , in the end , a fortunate one for the homeless , and almost starving terrier , of plebeian lineage , whose wail of distress had summoned two friends to the rescue . The creature had been ill - treated by some boys , who found Sunday afternoon hang heavy on their hands . The Professor carried the injured animal across the fields and through the woods , to Dunaghee . Here the wounds were dressed , and here the grateful creature found a new and blissful home . His devotion to the Professor was unbounded ; he followed him everywhere . Hadria 's reverence and admiration rose to the highest pitch of enthusiasm . Her father laughed at her . “
37175	37176	37161	37163	any decent fellow	1151	” “
37193	37342	37343	37343	I	0	” It was not merely the action , but the feeling revealed by the Professor 's words on that occasion , that had turned Hadria 's sentiment towards him , into one of worship . Algitha warned her that even the Professor was human . Hadria said she did not believe it , or rather she believed that he was inordinately , tenderly , superlatively human , and that he had gone many steps farther in that direction than the rest of his generation . He was dowered with instincts and perceptions belonging to some kinder , nobler race than ours . Miss Du Prel looked grave . She took occasion to mention that the Professor had never ceased to grieve for his wife , to whom he had been passionately attached , and that he , almost alone among men , would never love any other woman . “
37352	37356	37343	37343	I	0	” said Hadria . “
37367	37368	37360	37360	yourself	0	” “
37372	37373	37343	37343	I	0	” “
37388	37393	37343	37343	I	0	” Hadria was silent . “
37420	37426	37427	37427	I	0	” she pronounced at last . “
37444	37450	37427	37427	I	0	” ( Valeria coloured . ) “
37478	37742	37475	37475	I	0	” THE autumn was now on the wane ; the robins sang clear , wild little songs in the shrubberies , the sunshine fell slanting across the grass . And at night , the stars twinkled with a frosty brilliancy , and the flowers were cut down by cruel invisible hands . The long dark evenings and the shrieking winds of winter were before them . With the shortening of the days , and the sweeping away of great shoals of leaves , in the frequent gales , Miss Du Prel 's mood grew more and more sombre . At last she announced that she could stand the gloom of this wild North no longer . She had made arrangements to return to London , on the morrow . As suddenly as she had appeared on the scene , she vanished , leaving but one day to grieve at the prospect of parting . It was through an accidental turn in the conversation , on this last day , that the difference between her creed and the Professor 's was brought to light , accounting to Hadria for many things , and increasing , if possible , her admiration for the unconscious Professor . As for her own private and personal justification for hope , Valeria asserted that she had none . Not even the thought of her work — usually a talisman against depression — had any power to comfort . Who cared for her work , unless she perjured herself , and told the lies that the public loved to hear ? “
37749	37753	37475	37475	I	0	” asked Hadria , “
37791	37800	37806	37806	you	1162	” Miss Du Prel brightened for a moment . “
37827	37828	37823	37823	them	631	” “
37852	37979	37850	37850	them	631	” Miss Du Prel was still disposed to find fault with the general scheme of things , which she regarded as responsible for her own woes , great and little . Survival of the fittest ! What was that but another name for the torture and massacre of the unfit ? Nature 's favourite instruments were war , slaughter , famine , misery ( mental and physical ) , sacrifice and brutality in every form , with a special malignity in her treatment of the most highly developed and the noblest of the race . The Professor in vain pointed out that Valeria 's own revolt against the brutality of Nature , was proof of some higher law in Nature , now in course of development . “
38004	38116	37850	37850	them	631	” he said , and he insisted that the supreme business of man , was to evolve a scheme of life on a higher plane , wherein the weak shall not be forced to agonize for the strong , so far as mankind can intervene to prevent it . Let man follow the dictates of pity and generosity in his own soul . They would never lead him astray . While Miss Du Prel laid the whole blame upon natural law , the Professor impeached humanity . Men , he declared , cry out against the order of things , which they , in a large measure , have themselves created . “
38190	38191	38201	38201	them	4352	” “
38203	38280	38199	38199	we	1167	” said the Professor . Miss Du Prel somewhat inconsequently attempted to defend such imitation , on the ground that sacrifice is a law of life , a law of which she had just been bitterly complaining . But at this , the Professor would only laugh . His opponent indignantly cited scientific authority of the most solemn and weighty kind ; the Professor shook his head . Familiarity with weighty scientific authorities had bred contempt . “
38284	38308	38309	38309	I	0	” he exclaimed , with a sudden outbreak of the scorn and impatience that Hadria had seen in him on one other occasion , “
38324	38366	38199	38199	we	1167	” Miss Du Prel hugged herself in the thought of her long list of scouted authorities . They had assured her that our care of the weak , by interfering with the survival of the fittest , is injuring the race . “
38400	38421	38389	38390	the fittest	1174	” recommended the Professor . Miss Du Prel failed to see how this proved anything more than bad general conditions . “
38487	38557	38561	38561	you	1178	” Nothing would convince Miss Du Prel that the preservation of weakly persons was not injurious to the community . To this the Professor replied , that what is lost by their salvation is more than paid back by the better conditions that secured it . The strong , he said , were strengthened and enabled to retain their strength by that which saves the lives of the weak . “
38729	38749	38750	38750	I	0	” Miss Du Prel was silent for a moment . Her sympathy but not her hope had been roused . “
38761	38765	38752	38752	I	0	” she said ; “
38795	38796	38797	38797	I	0	” “
38809	38816	38821	38821	I	0	” said the Professor , dryly ; “
38890	38891	38925	38925	thy	4357	” “
38902	38903	38900	38900	humanity	4357	” “
38910	38915	38907	38908	Poor humanity	1190	” cried the Professor . “
38928	38929	38907	38908	Poor humanity	1190	” “
38940	38946	38907	38908	Poor humanity	1190	” argued Miss Du Prel . “
38965	38969	38907	38908	Poor humanity	1190	” he retorted . “
38978	38986	38907	38908	Poor humanity	1190	” exclaimed Hadria . The Professor smiled . “
38989	38993	38994	38994	we	1171	” he added , “
39143	39154	39156	39156	they	1201	” cried the Professor , with a burst of energy ; “
39190	39333	39156	39156	they	1201	” There are some sentences and some incidents that fix themselves , once for all , in the memory , often without apparent reason , to remain as an influence throughout life . In this fashion , the afternoon 's discussion registered itself in the memory of the silent member of the trio . In her dreams that night , those three concluding and energetic adjectives played strange pranks , as , in dreams , words and phrases often will . Her deep regret at Miss Du Prel 's departure , her dread of her own future , her growing sense of the torment , and horror , and sacrifice that form so large a part of the order of the world , all appeared to be united fantastically in malignant and threatening form , in the final words of the Professor : “
39346	39453	39156	39156	they	1201	” The agony of the whole earth seemed to hang over the sleeper , hovering and black and intolerable , crushing her with a sense of hopeless pity and fatigue . And on waking , though the absurd masquerading of words and thoughts had ceased , she was still weighed down with the horror of the dream , which she knew had a corresponding reality still more awful . And there was no adversary to all this anguish ; everybody acquiesced , nay , everybody threw on yet another log to the martyr 's pile , and coolly watched the hungry flames at their work , for “
39456	39479	39156	39156	they	1201	” they all agreed , demanded sacrifice . It was in vain to turn for relief to the wise and good ; the “
39481	39516	39156	39156	they	1201	” insisted on keeping up the altar fires that they might appease the blood - thirsty goddess by a continuous supply of victims ( for the noble purpose of saving the others ) ; the “
39518	39587	39156	39156	they	1201	” trusted to the decision of the wise ; they were humbly content to allow others to judge for them for by this means would they not secure some of the spoils ? No , no ; there was no help anywhere on earth , no help , no help . So ran Hadria 's thoughts , in the moments of vivid sensation , between sleeping and waking . “
39606	39659	39156	39156	they	1201	” Perhaps a brilliant beam that had found its way , like a message of mercy , through the blind , and shone straight on to the pillow , had suggested the form of the last thought . Hadria moved her hand into the ray , that she might feel the warmth and “
39665	39819	39156	39156	they	1201	” There was one person , and at the moment , only one , whose existence was comforting to remember . The hundreds of kind and good people , who were merely kind and good where popular sentiment expected or commended such conduct , gave no re - assurance ; on the contrary , they proved the desperation of our plight , since wisdom and goodness themselves were busy at the savage work . When the party met at breakfast , an hour later , the Professor caused universal consternation , by announcing that he would be obliged to return to London on that very day , having received a letter , by the morning 's post , which left him no choice . The very butler paused , for a perceptible period , while handing ham and eggs to the guest . Forks and knives were laid down ; letters remained unopened . “
39833	39838	39831	39831	Chantrey	132	” said Mr. Fullerton , “
39859	39900	39903	39903	your	1202	” But the Professor explained that his departure was inevitable , and that he must go by the morning train . He and Hadria had time for a short walk to the river , by the pathway of the tunnels . “
39909	39914	39915	39915	I	0	” the Professor asked . “
40120	40121	40130	40130	I	0	” “
40133	40137	40130	40130	I	0	” said Hadria , “

40364	40370	40356	40356	I	0	” said the Professor wistfully ; “
40443	40797	40821	40821	you	0	” HADRIA had determined upon making a strong and patient effort to pursue her work during the winter , while doing her best , at the same time , to please her mother , and to make up to her , as well as she could , for Algitha 's departure . She would not be dismayed by difficulties : as the Professor said , only cowards and weaklings escaped these . She treated herself austerely , and found her power of concentration increasing , and her hold on herself greater . But , as usual , her greatest effort had to be given , not to the work itself , but to win opportunity to pursue it . Mrs. Fullerton opposed her daughter 's endeavours as firmly as ever . It was not good for a girl to be selfishly pre - occupied . She ought to think of others . If Hadria yielded the point on any particular occasion , her mood and her work were destroyed : if she resisted , they were equally destroyed , through the nervous disturbance and the intense depression which followed the winning of a liberty too dearly bought . The incessant rising and quelling of her impulse and her courage — like the ebb and flow of tides — represented a vast amount of force not merely wasted , but expended in producing a dangerous wear and tear upon the system . The process told upon her health , and was the beginning of the weakening and unbalancing of the splendid constitution which Hadria , in common with every member of the family , enjoyed as a birthright . The injury was insidious but serious . Hadria , unable to command any certain part of the day , began to sit up at night . This led to a direct clash of wills . Mr. Fullerton said that the girl was doing her best to ruin her health for life ; Mrs. Fullerton wished to know why Hadria , who had all the day at her disposal , could not spend the night rationally . “
40815	40819	40799	40799	I	0	” said Hadria . “
40835	40918	40821	40821	you	0	” said the mother , genuinely hurt . Hadria entered her room , one evening , tired out and profoundly depressed . A table , covered with books , stood beside the fire . She gave the top - heavy pile an impatient thrust and the mass fell , with a great crash , to the floor . A heap of manuscript — her musical achievement for the past year — was involved in the fall . She contemplated the wreck gravely . “
41024	41032	41033	41033	People	3687	” She drew the score towards her . “
41051	41208	41046	41046	People	3687	” She turned over the pages critically . If only this instinct were not so overwhelmingly strong ! Hadria wondered how many other women , from the beginning of history , had cursed the impulse to create ! Fortunately , it was sometimes extinguished altogether , as to - night , for instance , when every impression , every desire was swept clean out of her , and her mind presented a creditable blank , such as really ought to satisfy the most exacting social mentor . In such a state , a woman might be induced to accept anything ! Hadria brought out two letters from her pocket ; one from the Professor , the other from Miss Du Prel . The latter had been writing frequently of late , pointing out the danger of Hadria 's exaggerated ideas , and the probability of their ruining her happiness in life . Valeria had suffered herself from “
41211	41342	41701	41701	They	1237	” and knew how fatal they were . Life could not be exactly as one would have it , and it was absolutely necessary , in order to avoid misery for oneself and others , to consent to take things more or less as they were ; to make up one 's mind to bend a little , rather than have to break , in the end . Things were never quite so shocking as they seemed to one 's youthful imagination . The world was made up of compromises . Good was mixed with evil everywhere . The domestic idea , as Hadria called it , might be , in its present phase , somewhat offensive , but it could be redeemed in its application , in the details and “
41346	41700	41701	41701	They	1237	” Valeria could not warn Hadria too earnestly against falling into the mistake that Valeria herself had made . She had repudiated the notion of anything short of an ideal union ; a perfect comradeship , without the shadow of restraint or bondage in the relationship ; and not having found it , she had refused the tie altogether . She could not bring herself to accept the lesser thing , having conceived the possibility of the greater . She now saw her error , and repented it . She was reaping the penalty in a lonely and unsatisfied life . For a long time her work had seemed to suffice , but she felt now that she had been trusting to a broken reed . She was terrified at her solitude . She could not face the thought of old age , without a single close tie , without a home , without a hold upon her race . She ended by entreating Hadria not to refuse marriage merely because she could not find a man to agree with her in everything , or capable of entering into the spirit of the relationship that perhaps would unite the men and women of the future . It was a pity that Hadria had not been born a generation later , but since she had come into the world at this time of transition , she must try to avoid the tragedy that threatens all spirits who are pointing towards the new order , while the old is still working out its unexhausted impetus . This reiterated advice had begun to trouble Hadria . It did not convince her , but Valeria 's words were incessantly repeating themselves in her mind working as a ferment among her thoughts . The letters from Miss Du Prel and the Professor were to her , a source of great pleasure and of great pain . In her depressed moods , they would often rather increase her despondency , because the writers used to take for granted so many achievements that she had not been able to accomplish . “
41737	41778	41727	41727	I	0	” On the Professor 's letter , the comments were of a different character . He had recommended her to read certain books , and reminded her that no possessor of good books could lack the privilege of spiritual sanctuary . “
42024	42027	42023	42029	The “ true women ” of literature	1247	“ true women ”
42156	42404	42149	42154	those who have had exactly mine	1252	” Hadria did not keep up an active correspondence with Miss Du Prel or with the Professor . She had no idea of adding to the burden of their busy lives , by wails for sympathy . It seemed to her feeble , and contemptible , to ask to be dragged up by their strength , instead of exerting her own . If that were insufficient , why then let her go down , as thousands had gone down before her . As a miser telling his gold , she would read and re - read those occasional letters , written amidst the stress of life at high pressure , and bearing evidence of that life of thought and work , in their tense , full - packed phrases . With what a throb of longing and envy Hadria used to feel the vibration through her own nerves ! It was only when completely exhausted and harassed that the response was lacking . To - night everything seemed to be obliterated . Her hope , her interest were , for the moment , tired out . Her friends would be disappointed in her , but there was no help for it . She picked up the score of her music , and stood , with a handful of the once precious offspring of her brain held out towards the flames . Then she drew it back , and half closed her eyes in self - scrutinizing thought . “
42408	42414	42416	42416	you	1253	” she said to herself , “
42534	43415	42531	42531	your	1253	” She mused over the little self - administered lecture . And probing down into her consciousness , she realized that she could not face the thought of surrender . She meant to fight on . The notion of giving in had been seized instinctively , for a moment of rest . Nothing should really make her cease the struggle , until the power itself had been destroyed . She was sure of it , in her heart , in spite of failures and miserably inadequate expressions of it . Suddenly , as a shaft of light through parting clouds , came bursting forth , radiant , rejoicing , that sense of power , large , resistless , genial as morning sunshine . Yes , yes , let them say what they might , discourage , smile , or frown as they would , the faculty was given to her , and she would fight for opportunity to use it while she had breath . AS if it had all been ingeniously planned , the minutest incidents and conditions of Hadria 's life conspired towards the event that was to decide its drift for ever . Often , in the dim afternoon , she would sit by the window and watch the rain sweeping across the country , longing then for Temperley 's music , which used to make the wild scene so unspeakably beautiful . Now there was no music , no music anywhere , only this fierce and mournful rush of the wind , which seemed as if it were trying to utter some universal grief . At sunset , braving the cold , she would mount the creaking staircase , pass along the silent upper corridors , and on through the empty rooms to the garret in the tower . The solitude was a relief ; the strangeness of the scene appealed to some wild instinct , and to the intense melancholy that lurks in the Celtic nature . Even at night , she did not shrink from braving the glooms and silences of the deserted upper floor , nor the solitude of the garret , which appeared the deeper , from the many memories of happy evenings that it evoked . She wished Ernest would come home . It was so long since she had seen her favourite brother . She could not bear the thought of his drifting away from her . What talks they had had in this old garret ! These nights in the tower , among the winds , soothed the trouble of her spirit as nothing else had power to do . The mystery of life , the thrill of existence , touched her with a strange joy that ran perilously near to pain . What vast dim possibilities lurked out there , in the hollows of the hills ! What inspiration thundered in the voice of the prophet wind ! Once , she had gone downstairs and out , alone , in a tearing storm , to wander across the bleak pastures , wrapt round by the wind as by a flame ; at one with the desperate elemental thing . The wanderer felt herself caught into the heart of some vast unknown power , of which the wind was but a thrall , until she became , for a moment , consciously part of that which was universal . Her personality grew dim she stood , as it seemed , face to face with Nature , divided from the ultimate truth by only a thin veil , to temper the splendour and the terror . Then the tension of personal feeling was loosened . She saw how entirely vain and futile were the things of life that we grieve and struggle over . It was not a side , an aspect of existence , but the whole of it that seemed to storm round her , in the darkness . No wonder , when the wind was let loose among the mountains , that the old Highland people thought that their dead were about them . All night long , after Hadria returned to her room in the keep , the wind kept up its cannonade against the walls , hooting in the chimneys with derisive voices , and flinging itself , in mad revolt , against the old - established hills and the stable earth , which changed its forms only in slow obedience to the persuadings of the elements , in the passing of centuries . It cared nothing for the passion of a single storm . And then came reaction , doubt . After all , humanity was a puny production of the Ages . Men and women were like the struggling animalculæ that her father had so often shewn the boys , in a drop of magnified ditch - water ; yet not quite like those microscopic insects , for the stupendous processes of life had at last created a widening consciousness , a mind which could perceive the bewildering vastness of Nature and its own smallness , which could , in some measure , get outside its own particular ditch , and the strife and struggle of it , groping upwards for larger realities — “
43424	43672	42531	42531	your	1253	” To go down next morning to breakfast ; to meet the usual homely events , was bewildering after such a night . Which was dream : this or that ? So solid and convincing seemed , at times , the interests and objects of every day , that Hadria would veer round to a sudden conviction that these things , or what they symbolized , were indeed the solid facts of human life , and that all other impressions arose from the disorderly working of overcharged brain - cells . It was a little ailment of youth and would pass off . Had it been possible to describe to her father the impressions made upon her by the world and Nature , as they had presented themselves to her imagination from her childhood , he would have prescribed change of air and gymnastics . Perhaps that was the really rational view of the matter . But what if these hygienic measures cured her of the haunting consciousness of mystery and vastness ; what if she became convinced of the essential importance of the Gordon pedigree , or of the amount of social consideration due to the family who had taken Clarenoc ? Would that alter the bewildring truths of which she would have ceased to think ? No ; it would only mean that the animalcule had returned to the occupations of its ditch , while the worlds and the peoples went spinning to their destiny . “
43681	43695	42531	42531	your	1253	” counselled everybody : people of all kinds , books of all kinds . “
43703	43707	42531	42531	your	1253	” thought Hadria , “
43842	44182	44183	44183	I	0	” It was at this somewhat fevered moment , that Hubert Temperley appeared , once more , upon the scene . Hadria was with her mother , taking tea at Drumgarren , when Mrs. Gordon , catching the sounds of carriage wheels , announced that she was expecting Hubert and his sister for a visit . In another second , the travellers were in the drawing - room . Hubert 's self - possession was equal to the occasion . He introduced his sister to Mrs. Fullerton and Hadria . Miss Temperley was his junior by a year ; a slight , neatly - built young woman , with a sort of tact that went on brilliantly up to a certain point , and then suddenly collapsed altogether . She had her brother 's self - complacency , and an air of encouragement which Mrs. Gordon seemed to find most gratifying . She dressed perfectly , in quiet Parisian fashion . Hadria saw that her brother had taken her into his confidence , or she concluded so from something in Miss Temperley 's manner . The latter treated Hadria with a certain familiarity , as if she had known her for some time , and she had a way of seeming to take her apart , when addressing her , as if there were a sort of understanding between them . It was here that her instinct failed her ; for she seemed unaware that this assumption of an intimacy that did not exist was liable to be resented , and that it might be unpleasant to be expected to catch special remarks sent over the heads of the others , although ostensibly for the common weal . Hadria thought that she had never seen so strange a contrast as this young woman 's behaviour , within and without the circle of her perceptions . It was the more remarkable , since her mind was bent upon the details and niceties of conduct , and the nuances of existence . “
44195	44223	44183	44183	I	0	” she promised , when Mrs. Fullerton rose to leave . Miss Temperley kept her word . She was charmed with the old house , praising authoritatively . “
44269	44291	44292	44292	Hadria	211	” Hubert shewed good taste in keeping away from Dunaghee , except to pay his call on Mr. and Mrs. Fullerton . “
44294	44299	44292	44292	Hadria	211	” said his sister , “
44412	44416	44420	44420	you	0	” Hadria flushed . “
44430	44431	44428	44428	I	0	” “
44439	44451	44434	44434	you	211	” said Henriette , drawing her chair closer to the fire . “
44466	44490	44455	44455	Hubert	118	” She looked arch . Hadria muttered something that might have discouraged a less persistent spirit , but Miss Temperley paid no attention . “
44509	44510	44499	44501	a ministering angel	1270	” “
44522	44523	44513	44513	you	0	” “
44530	44553	44527	44527	you	211	” cried that young woman , with the air of a playful potentate who has requested a favoured courtier to drop the ceremonious “
44556	44561	44564	44564	I	0	” in private conversation . “
44646	44647	44649	44649	they	1271	” “
44652	44657	44658	44658	We	1273	” asked Hadria absently . “
44664	44670	44661	44661	your	211	” Miss Temperley went on . “
44722	44838	44709	44709	you	211	” Hadria , not without an uneasy qualm , agreed to the suggestion , though by no means cordially . Accordingly brother and sister arrived , one afternoon , for the practice . Henriette took the leadership , visibly employed tact and judgment , talked a great deal , and was surprisingly delicate , as beseemed a Temperley . Hadria found the occasion somewhat trying nevertheless , and Hubert stumbled , at first , in his playing . In a few minutes , however , both musicians became possessed by the music , and then all went well . Henriette sat in an easy chair and listened critically . Now and then she would call out “
44841	44843	44709	44709	you	211	” or “
44846	44873	44709	44709	you	211	” and when the performance was over , she was warm in her congratulations . Hadria was flushed with the effort and pleasure of the performance . “
44884	44889	44877	44877	Hubert	118	” said his sister . “
44908	45307	44900	44900	You	1275	” Another afternoon was appointed ; Henriette left Hadria almost no choice . After the next meeting , the constraint had a little worn off , and the temptation to continue the practising was very strong . Henriette 's presence was reassuring . And then Hubert seemed so reasonable , and had apparently put the past out of his mind altogether . After the practice , brother and sister would linger a little in the drawing - room , chatting . Hubert appeared to advantage in his sister 's society . She had a way of striking his best vein . Her own talent ran with his , appealed to it , and created the conditions for its display . Her presence and inspiration seemed to produce , on his ability , a sort of cumulative effect . Henriette set all the familiar machinery in motion ; pressed the right button , and her brother became brilliant . A slight touch of diffidence in his manner softened the effect of his usual complacency . Hadria liked him better than she had liked him on his previous visit . His innate refinement appealed to her powerfully . Moreover , he was cultivated and well - read , and his society was agreeable . Oh , why did this everlasting , matrimonial idea come in and spoil everything ? Why could not men and women have interests in common , without wishing instantly to plunge into a condition of things which hampered and crippled them so miserably ? Hadria was disposed to under - rate all defects , and to make the most of all virtues in Hubert , at the present moment . He had come at just the right time to make a favourable impression upon her ; for the loneliness of her life had begun to leave its mark , and to render her extremely sensitive to influence . She was an alien among the people of her circle ; and she felt vaguely guilty in failing to share their ideas and ambitions . Their glances , their silences , conveyed a world of cold surprise and condemnation . Hubert was tolerance itself compared with the majority of her associates . She felt almost as if he had done her a personal kindness when he omitted to look astonished at her remarks , or to ignore them as “
45310	45583	44900	44900	You	1275	” Yet she felt uneasy about this renewal of the practices , and tried to avoid them as often as possible , though sorely against her inclination . They were so great a relief and enjoyment . Her inexperience , and her carelessness of conventional standards , put her somewhat off her guard . Hubert showed no signs of even remembering the interview of last year , that had been cut short by her father 's entrance . Why should she insist on keeping it in mind ? It was foolish . Moreover she had been expressly given to understand , in a most pointed manner , that her conduct would not be misinterpreted if she allowed him to come occasionally . From several remarks that Temperley made , she saw that he too regarded the ordinary domestic existence with distaste . It offended his fastidiousness . He was fastidious to his finger - tips . It amused Hadria to note the contrast between him and Mr. Gordon , who was a typical father of a family ; limited in his interests to that circle ; an amiable ruler of a tiny , somewhat absurd little world , pompous and important and inconceivably dull . The bourgeois side of this life was evidently displeasing to Hubert . Good taste was his fetish . From his remarks about women , Hadria was led to observe how subtly critical he was with regard to feminine qualities , and wondered if his preference for herself ought to be regarded as a great compliment . Henriette congratulated her on having been admired by the fastidious Hubert . “
45593	45601	44900	44900	You	1275	” Hadria replied with a cynical smile , “
45646	45647	45648	45648	They	3698	” “
45657	45795	45796	45796	I	0	” said Henriette . DURING Henriette 's visit , one of the meetings of the Preposterous Society fell due , and she expressed a strong wish to be present . She also craved the privilege of choosing the subject of discussion . Finally , she received a formal request from the members to give the lecture herself . She was full of enthusiasm about the Society ( such an educating influence ! ) , and prepared her paper with great care . There had been a tendency among the circle , to politely disagree with Henriette . Her ideas respecting various burning topics were at variance with the trend of opinion at Dunaghee , and Miss Temperley was expected to take this opportunity of enlightening the family . The family was equally resolved not to be enlightened . “
45806	45811	45796	45796	I	0	” said the lecturer , “
45832	46023	45823	45823	I	0	” The audience , among whom Hubert had been admitted at his sister 's earnest request , drew themselves together , and a little murmur of battle ran along the line . Henriette 's figure , in her well - fitting Parisian gown , looked singularly out of place in the garret , with the crazy old candle - holder beside her , the yellow flame of the candle flinging fantastic shadows on the vaulted roof , preposterously distorting her neat form , as if in wicked mockery . The moonlight streamed in , as usual on the nights chosen by the Society for their meetings . Henriette 's paper was neatly expressed , and its sentiments were admirable . She maintained a perfect balance between the bigotry of the past and the violence of the present . Her phrases seemed to rock , like a pair of scales , from excess to excess , on either side . She came to rest in the exact middle . This led to the Johnsonian structure , or , as Hadria afterwards said , to the style of a Times leading article : “
46040	46185	45796	45796	I	0	” At the end of the lecture , the audience found themselves invited to sympathize cautiously and circumspectly with the advancement of women , but led , at the same time , to conclude that good taste and good feeling forbade any really nice woman from moving a little finger to attain , or to help others to attain , the smallest fraction more of freedom , or an inch more of spiritual territory , than was now enjoyed by her sex . When , at some future time , wider privileges should have been conquered by the exertions of someone else , then the really nice woman could saunter in and enjoy the booty . But till then , let her leave boisterous agitation to others , and endear herself to all around her by her patience and her loving self - sacrifice . “
46193	46361	45796	45796	I	0	” Hadria was heard to mutter to an adjacent member . The lecturer , in her concluding remarks , gave a smile of ineffable sweetness , sadly marred , however , by the grotesque effect of the flickering shadows that were cast on her face by the candle . After all , duty not right was the really important matter , and the lecturer thought that it would be better if one heard the former word rather oftener in connection with the woman 's question , and the latter word rather more seldom . Then , with new sweetness , and in a tone not to be described , she went on to speak of the natural responsibilities and joys of her sex , drawing a moving , if somewhat familiar picture of those avocations , than which she was sure there could be nothing higher or holier . For some not easily explained cause , the construction of this sentence gave it a peculiar unctuous force : “
46365	46371	45796	45796	I	0	” as Fred afterwards remarked , “
46383	46418	45796	45796	I	0	” For weeks after this memorable lecture , if any very lofty altitude had to be ascended in conversational excursions , the aspirant invariably smiled with ineffable tenderness and lightly scaled the height , murmuring “
46421	46487	45796	45796	I	0	” to a vanquished audience . The lecture was followed by a discussion that rather took the stiffness out of Miss Temperley 's phrases . The whole party was roused . Algitha had to whisper a remonstrance to the boys , for their solemn questions were becoming too preposterous . The lecture was discussed with much warmth . There was a tendency to adopt the form “
46490	46678	45796	45796	I	0	” with some frequency . Bursts of laughter startled a company of rats in the wainscoting , and there was a lively scamper behind the walls . No obvious opposition was offered . Miss Temperley 's views were examined with gravity , and indeed in a manner almost pompous . But by the end of that trying process , they had a sadly bedraggled and plucked appearance , much to their parent 's bewilderment . She endeavoured to explain further , and was met by guilelessly intelligent questions , which had the effect of depriving the luckless objects of their solitary remaining feather . The members of the society continued to pine for information , and Miss Temperley endeavoured to provide it , till late into the night . The discussion finally drifted on to dangerous ground . Algitha declared that she considered that no man had any just right to ask a woman to pledge herself to love him and live with him for the rest of her life . How could she ? Hubert suggested that the woman made the same claim on the man . “
46684	46688	45796	45796	I	0	” said Algitha . “
46736	46737	46730	46730	They	1284	” “
46755	46759	46739	46739	they	1284	” said Henriette . “
46782	46786	46765	46765	they	1284	” suggested Fred . “
46802	46806	46792	46792	you	81	” Ernest inquired . “
46822	46826	46792	46792	you	81	” Algitha declared . “
46832	46833	46792	46792	you	81	” “
46882	46889	46892	46892	you	81	” Miss Temperley broke into protest . “
46901	47028	46892	46892	you	81	” Algitha would not admit that it was faithlessness . She said it was mere honesty . She could see nothing inherently wrong in falling in love genuinely after one arrived at years of discretion . She thought it inherently idiotic , and worse , to make a choice that ought to be for life , at years of indiscretion . Still , people were idiotic , and that must be considered , as well as all the other facts , such as the difficulty of really knowing each other before marriage , owing to social arrangements , and also owing to the training , which made men and women always pose so ridiculously towards one another , pretending to be something that they were not . “
47034	47040	47045	47045	you	81	” cried Ernest , laughing ; “
47115	47116	47119	47119	she	1291	” “
47129	47136	47119	47119	she	1291	” Fred interposed with a chuckle , “
47140	47141	47119	47119	she	1291	” “
47165	47170	47142	47142	I	0	” said Algitha serenely . “
47178	47179	47182	47182	She	1291	” “
47190	47198	47182	47182	She	1291	” ejaculated Fred , with a chuckle . “
47201	47205	47182	47182	She	1291	” repeated Algitha . “
47264	47265	47259	47259	my	0	” “
47278	47291	47270	47270	your	0	” asked Temperley , turning , in some trepidation , to Hadria . “
47313	47340	47343	47343	you	0	” Hubert sank back in his chair , and ran his hand over his brow . He seemed about to speak , but he checked himself . “
47350	47355	47343	47343	you	0	” cried Miss Temperley . “
47364	47368	47359	47359	Topsy	144	” said Fred . “
47382	47386	47359	47359	Topsy	144	” said Ernest , “
47399	47400	47401	47401	I	0	” “
47418	47423	47401	47401	I	0	” observed Miss Temperley . “
47455	47456	47458	47459	your mother	832	” “
47468	47476	47477	47477	Mother	103	” There was a shout of laughter . “
47497	47501	47477	47477	Mother	103	” said Hadria . “
47513	47517	47518	47518	mother	3851	” cried Fred ; “
47530	47531	47532	47532	Her	103	” “
47545	47549	47532	47532	Her	103	” Hadria observed . “
47560	47564	47567	47567	her	103	” persisted Henriette . “
47569	47577	47565	47565	You	0	” prompted Fred , with undisguised glee . “
47584	47588	47578	47578	She	103	” said Algitha . “
47599	47604	47578	47578	She	103	” cried Miss Temperley . “
47625	47626	47578	47578	She	103	” “
47632	47636	47578	47578	She	103	” urged Fred ; “
47643	47644	47578	47578	She	103	” “
47648	47656	47578	47578	She	103	” cried Ernest with a warning frown . “
47674	47779	47667	47667	I	0	” Fred answered with serenity . Henriette felt that nothing more could be done with this strange audience . Her business was really with the President of the Society . The girl was bent on ruining her life with these wild notions . Miss Temperley decided that it would be better to talk to Hadria quietly in her own room , away from the influence of these eccentric brothers and that extraordinary sister . After all , it was Algitha who had originated the shocking view , not Hadria , who had merely agreed , doubtless out of a desire to support her sister . “
47798	47811	47790	47790	I	0	” said Henriette , when they were established in Hadria 's room . “
47823	47861	47812	47812	I	0	” was Hadria 's ambiguous reply . Then Henriette opened her batteries . She talked without interruption , her companion listening , agreeing occasionally with her adversary , in a disconcerting manner ; then falling into silence . “
47954	47955	47952	47952	hers	91	” “
47962	47963	47964	47964	I	0	” “
47972	47973	47964	47964	I	0	” “
48015	48092	48093	48093	You	0	” Henriette grew eloquent . She recalled instances of women who had fulfilled all their home duties , and been successful in other walks as well ; she drew pictures in attractive colours of Hadria in a home of her own , with far more liberty than was possible under her parents ' roof : and then she drew another picture of Hadria fifteen years hence at Dunaghee . Hadria covered her face with her hands . “
48164	48165	48142	48142	You	0	” “
48189	48190	48167	48167	you	0	” “
48196	48202	48167	48167	you	0	” Henriette did not answer . “
48314	48315	48316	48316	I	0	” “
48325	48329	48316	48316	I	0	” said Henriette , “

48373	48386	48387	48387	You	3722	” Hadria 's quiet tone was suddenly changed to one of scorn . “
48452	48457	48458	48458	I	0	” Henriette was baffled . “
48473	48477	48465	48465	you	3722	” she said . “
48533	48534	48552	48552	you	3722	” “

48630	48631	48632	48632	You	3722	” “
48685	48689	48691	48691	Hadria	211	“ Wise man ! ”
48714	48715	48708	48708	you	3722	” “
48800	48807	48808	48808	You	3722	” Henriette heaved a discouraged sigh . “
48816	48821	48808	48808	You	3722	” she said emphatically ; “
48830	48831	48822	48822	you	3722	” “
48836	48837	48822	48822	you	3722	” “

48895	48899	48871	48871	I	0	” murmured Henriette . “
48902	48907	48871	48871	I	0	” echoed Hadria scornfully . “
48928	48929	48915	48926	a man who had the paltry , ungenerous instinct to enchain me	1334	” “
48941	48942	48945	48945	I	0	” “
48948	48952	48945	48945	I	0	” interrupted Hadria . “

49052	49056	49057	49057	My	0	” Henriette stared . “
49064	49065	49057	49057	My	0	” “
49088	49105	49106	49107	My mother	4254	” Hadria at length gave way to a laugh that had been threatening for some time . “
49109	49254	49106	49107	My mother	4254	” she observed simply . Henriette gave it up . THE family had reassembled for the New Year 's festivities . The change in Algitha since her departure from home was striking . She was gentler , more affectionate to her parents , than of yore . The tendency to grow hard and fretful had entirely disappeared . The sense of self was obviously lessened with the need for self - defence . Hadria discovered that an attachment was springing up between her sister and Wilfred Burton , about whom she wrote so frequently , and that this development of her emotional nature , united with her work , had given a glowing centre to her life which showed itself in a thousand little changes of manner and thought . Hadria told her sister that she felt herself unreal and fanciful in her presence . “
49320	49326	49310	49310	them	1346	” Algitha shook her head . “
49333	49337	49310	49310	them	1346	” she said . “
49408	49412	49413	49413	His	1352	” added Algitha , “
49447	49448	49449	49450	The devil	1352	” “
49456	49653	49449	49450	The devil	1352	” said Hadria . Miss Temperley had been asked to stay at Dunaghee for the New Year . Algitha conceived for her a sentiment almost vindictive . Hadria and the boys enjoyed nothing better than to watch Miss Temperley giving forth her opinions , while Algitha 's figure gradually stiffened and her neck drew out , as Fred said , in truly telescopic fashion , like that of Alice in Wonderland . The boys constructed a figure of cushions , stuffed into one of Algitha 's old gowns , the neck being a padded broom - handle , made to work up and down at pleasure ; and with this counterfeit presentment of their sister , they used to act the scene amidst shouts of applause , Miss Temperley entering , on one occasion , when the improvised cocoa - nut head had reached its culminating point of high disdain , somewhere about the level of the curtain - poles . On New - Year's - eve , Dunaghee was full of guests . There was to be a children 's party , to which however most of the grown - up neighbours were also invited . “
49659	49750	49449	49450	The devil	1352	” cried Henriette , standing with her neat foot on the fender in the hall , where the children were playing blind man 's buff . Mrs. Fullerton sat watching them with a dreamy smile . The scene recalled many an old memory . Mr. Fullerton was playing with the children . Everyone remarked how well the two girls looked in their new evening gowns . They had made them themselves , in consequence of a wager with Fred , who had challenged them to combine pink and green satisfactorily . “
49756	49762	49449	49450	The devil	1352	” Temperley ventured to remark . “
49767	49768	49770	49770	my	0	” “
49773	49777	49778	49778	I	0	” cried Fred . “

49811	49870	49808	49808	Mrs.	1356	” He stopped short abruptly . Fred gave a chuckle . Indiscreet eyes wandered towards Mrs. Gordon 's brocade and silver . Later in the evening , that lady played dance music in a florid manner , resembling her taste in dress . The younger children had gone home , and the hall was filled with spinning couples . “
49881	49886	49871	49871	I	0	” said Miss Temperley . “
49907	49908	49871	49871	I	0	” “
49913	49918	49871	49871	I	0	” said Mr. Fullerton . “
49931	49943	49944	49945	The girl	3739	” Mr. Fullerton executed a step or two with great agility . “
49956	49961	49944	49945	The girl	3739	” said Mrs. Fullerton . “
49979	49980	49971	49971	she	3739	” “
49990	49994	49971	49971	she	3739	” observed Fred . “
50038	50039	50032	50032	she	3739	” “
50045	50049	50032	50032	she	3739	” added Ernest . “
50058	50059	50032	50032	she	3739	” “
50064	50085	50086	50086	I	0	” cried Miss Temperley . She and her brother found themselves watching the dancing a little apart from the others . “
50096	50118	50094	50094	Hubert	118	” she said in a low voice . He was silent for a moment , twirling the tassel of the curtain . “
50153	50160	50161	50161	She	3739	” Temperley flung away the tassel . “
50240	50241	50242	50242	I	0	” “
50248	50253	50242	50242	I	0	” said Hubert tolerantly . “
50266	50274	50275	50275	They	1365	” He hugged this sentence with satisfaction . “
50289	50291	50278	50281	the young Russians one	1367	” said Henriette—“all
50297	50298	50278	50281	the young Russians one	1367	” “
50305	50318	50300	50300	you	0	” Henriette 's hand was laid comfortingly on her brother 's arm . “
50357	50358	50359	50359	She	3739	” “
50369	50390	50359	50359	She	3739	” said Hubert , choosing a gentler word than obstinate to describe the quality in the lady of his affections . “
50467	50490	50464	50465	a wife	1373	” Henriette smiled and shook her head , by way of finish to her sentence . Hubert mused silently for some minutes . “
50509	50510	50511	50511	My	0	” “
50573	50574	50596	50596	her	3739	” “
50579	50583	50596	50596	her	3739	” cried Hubert ; “
50601	50602	50606	50606	she	3739	” “
50621	50628	50611	50611	I	0	” cried Henriette with a shudder . “
50675	50676	50668	50668	You	1375	” “
50685	50689	50679	50679	I	0	” said Hubert , “
50692	50701	50702	50702	I	0	” ( he shook his head and sighed ) “
50713	50723	50679	50679	I	0	” He rose abruptly , and Henriette followed him . “
50732	50736	50679	50679	I	0	” she murmured , “
50799	50800	50822	50822	You	1375	” “
50807	50812	50813	50813	we	1378	” cried Mr. Fullerton , “
50842	51001	50831	50832	Mrs. McPherson	149	” The kindly old Scottish dame had come , with two nieces , from a distance of ten miles . A thrill ran through the company when the strange old tune began . Everyone rushed for a partner , and two long rows of figures stood facing one another , eager to start . Temperley asked Hadria to dance with him . Algitha had Harold Wilkins for a partner . The two long rows were soon stepping and twirling with zest and agility . A new and wilder spirit began to possess the whole party . The northern blood took fire and transfigured the dancers . The Temperleys seemed to be fashioned of different clay ; they were able to keep their heads . Several elderly people had joined in the dance , performing their steps with a conscientious dexterity that put some of their juniors to shame . Mr. Fullerton stood by , looking on and applauding . “
51011	51024	51025	51025	He	705	” said Temperley , as he met his partner for a moment . “
51038	51164	51165	51165	You	1382	” Hadria 's reels were celebrated , not without reason . Some mad spirit seemed to possess her . It would appear almost as if she had passed into a different phase of character . She lost caution and care and the sense of external events . When the dance was ended , Hubert led her from the hall . She went as if in a dream . She would not allow herself to be taken beyond the sound of the grotesque old dance music that was still going on , but otherwise she was unresisting . He sat down beside her in a corner of the dining - room . Now and then he glanced at his companion , and seemed about to speak . “
51173	51179	51165	51165	You	1382	” he at last remarked . “
51187	51195	51165	51165	You	1382	” she said in a dreamy tone . “
51284	51285	51234	51237	some ancient Celtic people	1384	” “
51324	51337	51338	51338	I	0	” Hadria gave a startled glance at her companion , and shuddered . “
51347	51540	51338	51338	I	0	” she said . He was puzzled , but more hopeful than usual . Hadria might almost have accepted him in sheer absence of mind . He put the thought in different terms . He began to speak more boldly . He gave his view of life and happiness , his philosophy and religion . Hadria lazily agreed . She lay under a singular spell . The bizarre old music smote still upon the ear . She felt as if she were in the thrall of some dream whose events followed one another , as the scenes of a moving panorama unfold themselves before the spectators . Temperley began to plead his cause . Hadria , with a startled look in her eyes , tried to check him . But her will refused to issue a vigorous command . Even had he been hateful to her , which he certainly was not , she felt that she would have been unable to wake out of the nightmare , and resume the conduct of affairs . The sense of the importance of personal events had entirely disappeared . What did it all matter ? “
51549	51609	51338	51338	I	0	” The graves would put it all right some day . As for attempting to direct one 's fate , and struggle out of the highways of the world — midsummer madness ! It was not only the Mrs. Gordons , but the Valeria Du Prel who told one so . Everybody said ( but in discreeter terms ) , “
51644	51760	51816	51816	you	0	” The savage builds his mud hut to shelter him from the wind and the rain and the terror of the beyond . Outside is the wilderness ready to engulf him . Rather than be left alone at the mercy of elemental things , with no little hut , warm and dark and stuffy , to shelter one , a woman will sacrifice everything — liberty , ambition , health , power , her very dignity . There was a letter in Hadria 's pocket at this moment , eloquently protesting in favour of the mud hut . Hadria must have been appearing to listen favourably to Temperley 's pleading , for he said eagerly , “
51780	51781	51772	51772	I	0	” “
51785	51796	51772	51772	I	0	” repeated Hadria , passing her hand across her eyes . “
51820	51834	51816	51816	you	0	” She spoke dreamily . The music was jigging on with strange merriment . “
51851	51859	51843	51843	I	0	” said Temperley , in some bewilderment . “
51873	51874	51843	51843	I	0	” “
51884	51888	51843	51843	I	0	” Temperley admitted ; “
51934	51965	51930	51930	you	211	” She gave a distressed gesture , and seemed to make some vain effort , as when the victim of a nightmare struggles to overcome the paralysis that holds him . “
51979	52308	51975	51975	I	0	” Still the trance seemed to hold her enthralled . The music was diabolically merry . She could fancy evil spirits tripping to it in swarms around her . They seemed to point at her , and wave their arms around her , and from them came an influence , magnetic in its quality , that forbade her to resist . All had been pre - arranged . Nothing could avert it . She seemed to be waiting rather than acting . Against her inner judgment , she had allowed those accursed practices to go on . Against her instinct , she had permitted Henriette to become intimate at Dunaghee ; indeed it would have been hard to avoid it , for Miss Temperley was not easy to discourage . Why had she assured Hadria so pointedly that Hubert would not misinterpret her consent to renew the practices ? Was it not a sort of treachery ? Had not Henriette , with her larger knowledge of the world , been perfectly well aware that whatever might be said , the renewal of the meetings would be regarded as encouragement ? Did she not know that Hadria herself would feel implicated by the concession ? Temperley 's long silence had been misleading . The danger had crept up insidiously . And had she not been treacherous to herself ? She had longed for companionship , for music , for something to break the strain of her wild , lonely life . Knowing , or rather half - divining the risk , she had allowed herself to accept the chance of relief when it came . Lack of experience had played a large part in the making of to - night 's dilemma . Hadria 's own strange mood was another ally to her lover , and for that , old Mrs. McPherson and her reels were chiefly responsible . Of such flimsy trifles is the human fate often woven . “
52320	52321	52313	52313	you	0	” “
52326	52330	52313	52313	you	0	” Hubert interposed . “
52346	52347	52351	52351	she	4161	” “
52356	52357	52351	52351	she	4161	” “
52368	52372	52358	52358	She	4161	” said Hubert . “
52391	52413	52381	52381	Hadria	211	” He bent forward , covering his face with his hands in deep dejection . His hope had begun to wane . “
52420	52424	52417	52417	I	0	” said Hadria . “
52443	52449	52417	52417	I	0	” He seized her hand . “
52532	52626	52635	52635	I	0	” He managed to be very convincing . He shewed that for a woman , life in her father 's house is far less free than in her own home ; that existence could be moulded to any shape she pleased . If Hadria hesitated only on this account her last reason was gone . It was not fair to him . He had been patient . He had kept silence for many months . But he could endure the suspense no longer . He took her hand . Then suddenly she rose . “
52639	52644	52635	52635	I	0	” she cried desperately . “
52652	52658	52659	52659	I	0	” he said following her . “
52674	52675	52667	52667	You	0	” “
52682	52686	52691	52691	Hadria	211	” she exclaimed . “
52723	52729	52705	52705	you	211	” Hadria turned very pale . “
52763	52764	52751	52751	She	1388	” “
52872	53289	52862	52862	I	0	” She would have found it a hard task to enlighten him . He had succeeded , to some extent , in lulling her fears , not in banishing them , for a sinister dread still muttered its warning beneath the surface thoughts . The strength of Temperley 's emotion had stirred her . The magic of personal influence had begun to tell upon her . It was so hard not to believe when some one insisted with such certainty , with such obvious sincerity , that everything would be right . He seemed so confident that she could make him happy , strange as it appeared . Perhaps after all — ? And what a release from the present difficulties . But could one trust ? A confused mass of feeling struggled together . A temptation to give the answer that would cause pleasure was very strong , and beneath all lurked a trembling hope that perhaps this was the way of escape . In apparent contradiction to this , or to any other hope , lay a sense of fatality , a sad indifference , interrupted at moments by flashes of very desperate caring , when suddenly the love of life , the desire for happiness and experience , for the exercise of her power , for its use in the service of her generation , became intense , and then faded away again , as obstacles presented their formidable array before the mind . In the midst of the confusion the thought of the Professor hovered vaguely , with a dim distressing sense of something wrong , of something within her lost and wretched and forlorn . Mrs. Fullerton passed through the room on the arm of Mr. Gordon . How delighted her mother would be if she were to give up this desperate attempt to hold out against her appointed fate . What if her mother and Mrs. Gordon and all the world were perfectly right and far - seeing and wise ? Did it not seem more likely , on the face of it , that they should be right , considering the enormous majority of those who would agree with them , than that she , Hadria , a solitary girl , unsupported by knowledge of life or by fellow - believers , should have chanced upon the truth ? Had only Valeria been on her side , she would have felt secure , but Valeria was dead against her . “
53300	53304	53298	53298	me	0	” Temperley pleaded . “
53337	53366	53325	53325	I	0	” He worked himself up into the belief that there never were two human beings so essentially at one , on all points , as he and Hadria . “
53390	53397	53379	53379	you	0	” she asked . Temperley remembered . “
53543	53544	53534	53534	They	1405	” “
53593	53598	53600	53600	you	0	” Hadria looked astonished . “
53610	53611	53600	53600	you	0	” “
53617	53618	53600	53600	you	0	” “
53636	53637	53638	53638	I	0	” “
53667	53676	53677	53677	You	211	” She gazed at him in puzzled scrutiny . “
53691	53692	53693	53693	I	0	” “
53700	53708	53695	53695	you	0	” he cried , eagerly following her , “
53713	53943	53711	53711	I	0	” At that moment Harold Wilkins came up to claim Hadria for a promised dance . Temperley gave a gesture of impatience . But Harold insisted , and Hadria walked with her partner into the hall where Mrs. Gordon was now playing a sentimental waltz , with considerable poetic license as to time . As everyone said : Mrs. Gordon played with so much expression . Temperley stood about in corners watching Hadria . She was flushed and silent , dancing with a still gliding movement under the skilful guidance of her partner . Temperley tried to win a glance as she passed round , but her eyes were resolutely fixed on the floor . Algitha followed her sister 's movements uneasily . She had noticed her absence during the last reel , and observed that Temperley also was not to be seen . She felt anxious . She knew Hadria 's emotional susceptibility . She knew Temperley 's convincing faculty , and also Hadria 's uneasy feeling that she had done wrong in allowing the practices to be resumed . Henriette had not failed to notice the signs of the times , and she annoyed Algitha beyond endurance by her obviously sisterly manner of addressing the family . She had taken to calling the boys by their first names . Fred shared his sister 's dislike to Henriette . “
53946	53953	53711	53711	I	0	” he cried with a snort , “
53972	54011	53956	53956	Temperley	141	” Algitha saw that Hubert was again by Hadria 's side before the evening was out . The latter looked white , and she avoided her sister 's glance . This last symptom seemed to Algitha the worst . “
54019	54023	54024	54024	she	211	” asked Fred , “
54094	54095	54070	54070	she	211	” “
54103	54112	54070	54070	she	211	” said Algitha gloomily . Fred glared enquiry . “
54125	54134	54122	54123	Hubert Temperley	118	” Fred opened his mouth and breathed deep . “
54150	54151	54137	54137	Hadria	211	” “
54162	54170	54154	54154	she	211	” said Algitha , shaking her head . “
54177	54278	54173	54173	I	0	” cried Fred . Not long after this , the guests began to disperse . Mrs. Gordon and her party were among the last to leave , having a shorter distance to go . Hubert Temperley was quiet and self - possessed , but Algitha felt sure that she detected a look of suppressed exultation in his demeanour , and something odiously brotherly in his mode of bidding them all good night . When everyone had left , and the family were alone , they gathered round the hall fire for a final chat , before dispersing for the night . “
54290	54295	54287	54288	Mrs. Fullerton	97	” said Miss Temperley . “
54315	54316	54303	54303	I	0	” “
54320	54329	54318	54318	I	0	” said Ernest , sotto voce to Algitha , “
54341	54342	54303	54303	I	0	” “
54358	54390	54303	54303	I	0	” exclaimed Mr. Fullerton . The first stroke of twelve began to sound almost as he spoke . He threw up the window and disclosed a night brilliant with stars . ( “
54396	54421	54303	54303	I	0	” said Hadria to herself . ) They all crowded up , keeping silence as the slow strokes of the clock told the hour . “
54429	54802	54303	54303	I	0	” cried Mr. Fullerton heartily . Tithonius , TENNYSON . A COUNTRYMAN with stooping gait touched his cap and bid good - day to a young woman who walked rapidly along the crisp high road , smiling a response as she passed . The road led gradually upward through a country blazing with red and orange for rolling miles , till the horizon closed in with the far - off blue of English hills . The old man slowly turned to watch the wayfarer , whose quick step and the look in her eyes of being fixed on objects beyond their owner 's immediate ken , might have suggested to the observant , inward perturbation . The lissom , swiftly moving figure was almost out of sight before the old man slowly wheeled round and continued on his way towards the hamlet of Craddock Dene , that lay in the valley about a mile further on . Meanwhile the young woman was speeding towards the village of Craddock on the summit of the gentle slope before her . A row of broad - tiled cottages came in sight , and on the hill - side the vicarage among trees , and a grey stone church which had seen many changes since its tower first looked out from the hill - top over the southern counties . The little village seemed as if it had forgotten to change with the rest of the country , for at least a hundred years . The spirit of the last century lingered in its quiet cottages , in the little ale - house with half - obliterated sign , in its air of absolute repose and leisure . There was no evidence of contest anywhere — except perhaps in a few mouldy advertisements of a circus and of a remarkable kind of soap , that were half peeling off a moss - covered wall . There were not even many indications of life in the place . The sunshine seemed to have the village street to itself . A couple of women stood gossiping over the gate of one of the cottages . They paused in their talk as a quick step sounded on the road . “
54809	54814	54805	54806	Mrs. Temperley	154	” one matron exclaimed . “
54847	55233	55239	55243	a stranger to the place	1414	” Mrs. Dodge and Mrs. Gullick continued to discuss this gloomy habit with exhaustive minuteness , involving themselves in side issues regarding the general conduct of life on the part of Mrs. Temperley , that promised solid material for conversation for the next week . It appeared from the observations of Mrs. Gullick , whose husband worked on Lord Engleton 's model farm , that about five years ago Mr. Temperley had rented the Red House at Craddock Dene , and had brought his new wife to live there . The Red House belonged to Professor Fortescue , who also owned the Priory , which had stood empty , said Mrs. Gullick , since that poor Mrs. Fortescue killed herself in the old drawing - room . Mr. Temperley went every day to town to attend to his legal business , and returned by the evening train to the bosom of his family . That family now consisted in his wife and two small boys ; pretty little fellows , added Mrs. Dodge , the pride of their parents ' hearts ; at least , so she had heard Mr. Joseph Fleming say , and he was intimate at the Red House . Mrs. Gullick did not exactly approve of Mrs. Temperley . The Red House was not , it would seem , an everflowing fount of sustaining port wine and spiritually nourishing literature . The moral evolution of the village had proceeded on those lines . The prevailing feeling was vaguely hostile ; neither Mrs. Gullick nor Mrs. Dodge exactly knew why . Mrs. Dodge said that her husband ( who was the sexton and gravedigger ) had found Mrs. Temperley always ready for a chat . He spoke well of her . But Dodge was not one of many . Mrs. Temperley was perhaps too sensitively respectful of the feelings of her poorer neighbours to be very popular among them . At any rate , her habits of seclusion did not seem to village philosophy to be justifiable in the eyes of God or man . Her apparent fondness for the society of the dead also caused displeasure . Why she went to the churchyard could not be imagined : one would think she had a family buried there , she who was , “
55245	55286	55239	55243	a stranger to the place	1414	” and could not be supposed to have any interest in the graves , which held for her nor kith nor kin ! Mrs. Temperley , however , appeared to be able to dispense with this element of attraction in the “
55290	56049	54805	54806	Mrs. Temperley	154	” She and a company of youthful Cochin - China fowls remained for hours among them , on this cheerful morning , and no observer could have determined whether it was the graves or the fowls that riveted her attention . She had perched herself on the stile that led from the churchyard to the fields : a slender figure in serviceable russet and irresponsible - looking hat , autumn - tinted too , in sympathy with the splendid season . In her ungloved left hand , which was at once sensitive and firm , she carried a book , keeping a forefinger between the pages to mark a passage . Her face bore signs of suffering , and at this moment , a look of baffled and restless longing , as if life had been for her a festival whose sounds came from a hopeless distance . Yet there was something in the expression of the mouth , that suggested a consistent standing aloof from herself and her desires . The lines of the face could never have been drawn by mere diffusive , emotional habits . Thought had left as many traces as feeling in the firm drawing . The quality of the face was of that indefinable kind that gives to all characteristic things their peculiar power over the imagination . The more powerful the quality , the less can it be rendered into terms . It is the one marvellous , remaining , musical fact not to he defined that makes the Parthenon , or some other masterpiece of art , translate us to a new plane of existence , and inspire , for the time being , the pessimist with hope and the sceptic with religion . The Cochin - Chinas pecked about with a contented mien among the long grass , finding odds and ends of nourishment , and here and there eking out their livelihood with a dart at a passing fly . Their long , comic , tufted legs , which seemed to form a sort of monumental pedestal whereon the bird itself was elevated , stalked and scratched about with an air of industrious serenity . There were few mornings in the year which left unstirred the grass which grew long over the graves , but this was one of the few . Each blade stood up still and straight , bearing its string of dewdrops . There were one or two village sounds that came subdued through the sunshine . The winds that usually haunted the high spot had fallen asleep , or were lying somewhere in ambush among the woodlands beyond . The look of strain had faded from the face of Mrs. Temperley , leaving only an expression of sadness . The removal of all necessity for concealing thought allowed her story to write itself on her face . The speculative would have felt some curiosity as to the cause of a sadness in one seemingly so well treated by destiny . Neither poverty nor the cares of great wealth could have weighed upon her spirit ; she had beauty , and a quality more attractive than beauty , which must have placed many things at her command ; she had evident talent — her very attitude proclaimed it — and the power over Fortune that talent ought to give . Possibly , the observer might reflect , the gift was of that kind which lays the possessor peculiarly open to her outrageous slings and arrows . Had Mrs. Temperley shown any morbid signs of self - indulgent emotionalism the problem would have been simple enough but this was not the case . The solitude was presently broken by the approach of an old man laden with pickaxe and shovel . He remarked upon the fineness of the day , and took up his position at a short distance from the stile , where the turf had been cleared away in a long - shaped patch . Here , with great deliberation he began his task . The sound of his steady strokes fell on the stillness . Presently , the clock from the grey tower gave forth its announcement — eleven . One by one , the slow hammer sent the waves of air rolling away , almost visibly , through the sunshine , their sound alternating with the thud of the pickaxe , so as to produce an effect of intentional rhythm . One might have fancied that clock and pickaxe iterated in turn , “
56062	56084	56184	56184	Lord	1417	” till the clock had come to the end of its tale , and then the pickaxe went on alone in the stillness—“Death
56092	56141	56148	56148	Dodge	155	” A smile , not easy to be accounted for , flitted across the face of Mrs. Temperley . The old gravedigger paused at last in his toil , leaning on his pickaxe , and bringing a red cotton handkerchief out of his hat to wipe his brow . “
56150	56169	56148	56148	Dodge	155	” remarked the onlooker , leaning her book upright on her knee and her chin on her hand . “
56214	56222	56240	56244	a troublin ' of hisself	1422	” She assented with a musing nod . “
56246	56251	56238	56238	he	3704	” added the philosopher . “
56269	56274	56252	56252	You	155	” said Mrs. Temperley . “
56295	56319	56279	56279	I	0	” Dodge modestly admitted . The lady knew , and liked to gratify , the gravedigger 's love of long - worded discourse . “
56323	56327	56373	56373	you	0	” she said , “
56343	56344	56333	56333	others	432	” “
56402	56403	56395	56395	them	1424	” “
56406	56415	56416	56416	You	0	” assented Mrs. Temperley with a sudden laugh . “
56446	56469	56439	56439	you	0	” Gratified by this appeal to his judgment , Dodge scratched his head , and leant both brawny arms upon his pickaxe . “
56474	56478	56472	56472	mum	1416	” he said , “
56571	56603	56562	56562	His	139	” added the gravedigger , falling to work again . A silence of some minutes was broken by Mrs. Temperley 's enquiry as to how long Dodge had followed this profession . “
56614	56618	56609	56609	mum	1416	” replied Dodge . “
56650	56670	56640	56640	they	1436	” Dodge was evidently prepared to stand up for the average corpse of the Craddock district against all competitors . “
56681	56698	56678	56678	I	0	” observed Mrs. Temperley , seemingly by way of supplying an explanation of the proud fact . “
56730	56731	56726	56726	one	329	” “
56740	56746	56699	56699	Lord	1439	” commented the lady musingly , “
56766	56767	56821	56821	I	0	” “
56775	56779	56821	56821	I	0	” Dodge explained ; “
56829	56830	56821	56821	I	0	” “
56837	56850	56821	56821	I	0	” interrupted Mrs. Temperley , with a nod towards the new grave . “
56879	56897	56872	56872	you	0	” This damning proof of his companion 's aloofness from village gossip seemed to paralyse the gravedigger . “
56922	56923	56911	56911	she	1451	” “
56944	56956	56957	56957	I	0	” Mrs. Temperley suggested , in defence of the deceased schoolmistress . “
56964	56968	56960	56960	her	1451	” Dodge explained ; “
56990	56991	56983	56988	a little chit o ' sixteen	1455	” “
57004	57009	56983	56988	a little chit o ' sixteen	1455	” Mrs. Temperley murmured . “
57038	57043	57032	57032	she	1451	” Dodge went on . “
57053	57058	57046	57046	me	0	” said his companion . “
57078	57079	57069	57069	she	1451	” “
57094	57113	57080	57080	She	1451	” Dodge proceeded , evidently quite unaware that he had omitted to give the clue to the situation . “
57122	57123	57114	57114	She	1451	” “
57131	57136	57138	57138	everybody	3781	” muttered Mrs. Temperley . “
57220	57268	57214	57214	he	3754	” Dodge added with sinister meaning . This dark hint conveyed absolutely no enlightenment to the mind of Mrs. Temperley , from sheer lack of familiarity , on her part , with the rumours of the district . Dodge applied himself with a spurt to his work . “
57284	57288	57275	57275	she	1451	” he continued ; “
57414	57415	57412	57412	mum	1416	” “
57437	57438	57427	57427	I	0	” “
57445	57449	57427	57427	I	0	” said Dodge . “
57457	57471	57472	57472	I	0	” cried Mrs. Temperley . Dodge ran his fingers through his hair judicially . “
57487	57491	57493	57493	you	1473	” he observed . “
57501	57518	57519	57519	You	1473	” Dodge puckered up his face into an odd expression of mingled reflection and worldly wisdom . “
57530	57536	57519	57519	You	1473	” he at length observed . “
57552	57558	57550	57550	blackguards	1482	” observed Mrs. Temperley calmly . “
57577	57584	57587	57587	she	0	” Dodge was startled into agreeing . “
57596	57613	57587	57587	she	0	” the lady went on , with quiet exasperation . Dodge seemed thrown off his bearings . “
57631	57636	57614	57616	Everybody in Craddock	1483	” said the gravedigger . “
57676	57691	57657	57657	Pears	163	” Mrs. Temperley gave a little laugh , which seemed to Dodge rather eccentric . “
57700	57704	57657	57657	Pears	163	” she asked . “
57729	57734	57724	57724	she	1488	” Dodge comprehensively explained . “
57741	57742	57738	57739	no relatives	1492	” “
57791	57792	57793	57793	Your	1496	” “
57799	57804	57793	57793	Your	1496	” observed Mrs. Temperley . “
57830	57831	57834	57834	I	0	” “
57838	57872	57873	57873	She	1488	” Dodge replied . There was a long pause , during which the stillness seemed to weigh upon the air , as if the pressure of Fate were hanging there with ruthless immobility . “
57883	57898	57899	57899	They	1501	” Dodge remarked , nodding with an aspect of half apology towards the grave . “
57906	57907	57899	57899	They	1501	” “
57915	58029	57899	57899	They	1501	” Mrs. Temperley exclaimed . The grave had made considerable progress before she descended from the stile and prepared to take her homeward way . On leaving , she made Dodge come with her to the gate , and point out the red - roofed cottage covered with monthly roses and flaming creeper , where the schoolmistress had passed so many years , and where she now lay with her work and her days all over , in the tiny upper room , at whose latticed window the sun used to wake her on summer mornings , or the winter rain pattered dreary prophecies of the tears that she would one day shed . “
58055	58056	58036	58037	the cook	1504	” “
58059	58092	58036	58037	the cook	1504	” replied Mrs. Temperley automatically . The maid waited for more discreet directions . She had given a month 's notice that very morning , because she found Craddock Dene too dull . “
58101	58106	58107	58107	We	1505	” Hubert had exclaimed . “
58117	58140	58114	58115	a Vandal	1507	” his wife replied . Mrs. Temperley gazed intently at her maid , the light of intelligence gradually dawning in her countenance . “
58153	58154	58151	58151	Sophia	166	” “
58159	58163	58157	58157	ma'am	1503	” replied Sophia . “
58184	58319	58157	58157	ma'am	1503	” The maid hesitated , but seeing from the wandering expression of her employer 's eye that her intellect was again clouded over , she retired to give the message to the cook — with comments . The library at the Red House was the only room that had been radically altered since the days of the former tenants , whose taste had leant towards the florid rather than the classic . The general effect had been toned down , but it was impossible to disguise the leading motive ; or what Mrs. Temperley passionately described as its brutal vulgarity . The library alone had been subjected to peine forte et dure . Mrs. Temperley said that it had been purified by suffering . By dint of tearing down and dragging out offending objects ( “
58324	58368	58157	58157	ma'am	1503	” cried the neighbours ) its prosperous and complacent absurdity had been humbled . Mrs. Temperley retired to this refuge after her encounter with Sophia . That perennially aggrieved young person entered almost immediately afterwards and announced a visitor , with an air that implied—“She'll
58388	58424	58386	58386	Yah	1513	” The pronunciation of the visitor 's name was such , that , for the moment , Mrs. Temperley did not recognize it as that of Miss Valeria Du Prel . She jumped up joyfully . “
58433	58688	58427	58427	Valeria	109	” The visit was explained after a characteristic fashion . Miss Du Prel realized that over two years had passed since she had seen Hadria , and moreover she had been seized with an overwhelming longing for a sight of country fields and a whiff of country air , so she had put a few things together in a handbag , which she had left at Craddock station by accident , and come down . Was there anyone who could go and fetch her handbag ? It was such a nuisance ; she laid it down for a moment to get at her ticket — she never could find her pocket , dressmakers always hid them in such an absurd way ; could Hadria recommend any dressmaker who did not hide pockets ? Was n't it tiresome ? She had no time - table , and so she had gone to the station that morning and waited till a Craddock train started , and by this arrangement it had come to pass that she had spent an hour and a half on the platform : she did not think she ever had such an unpleasant time ; why did n't they have trains oftener ? They did to Putney . Mrs. Temperley sat down and laughed . Whereupon the other 's face lightened and she joined in the laugh at her own expense , settling into the easy chair that her hostess had prepared for her , with a gesture of helplessness and comfort . “
58733	58734	58725	58725	you	1515	” “
58744	58755	58725	58725	you	1515	” interposed Mrs. Temperley hastily , setting her teeth together . “
58765	58771	58756	58756	You	1515	” said Miss Du Prel . “
58796	58797	58791	58791	One	329	” “
58809	58814	58791	58791	One	329	” cried Mrs. Temperley . “
58821	58836	58815	58815	I	0	” Her teeth were still set tight and hard , her hands were clenched . “
58870	58890	58846	58846	you	1515	” Mrs. Temperley 's face relaxed a little , though the signs of some strong emotion were still visible . “
58923	58924	58909	58917	a nice young brood of Cochin - China fowls	1520	” “
58932	58942	58927	58927	I	0	” exclaimed Miss Du Prel , with a shudder . “
58996	59015	59016	59016	Heaven	167	” The sharply - outlined face grew haggard and white , as its owner crouched over the fire . “
59032	59033	59016	59016	Heaven	167	” “
59036	59082	59016	59016	Heaven	167	” exclaimed Valeria with a burst of strange enthusiasm and sadness , that revealed all the fire and yearning and power that had raised her above her fellows in the scale of consciousness , with the penalty of a life of solitude and of sorrow . “
59102	59107	59016	59016	Heaven	167	” said Mrs. Temperley . “
59222	59223	59214	59220	one as one is held by music	1532	” “
59297	59298	59361	59361	You	1535	” “
59306	59311	59361	59361	You	1535	” muttered Mrs. Temperley . “
59350	59360	59361	59361	You	1535	” Mrs. Temperley was seized with a bitter mood . “
59366	59370	59361	59361	You	1535	” she said ; “
59426	59439	59443	59443	I	0	” The entrance of Sophia with firewood turned the current of conversation . “
59453	59458	59443	59443	I	0	” Mrs. Temperley exclaimed . “
59601	59609	59610	59610	I	0	” added Mrs. Temperley with a laugh , “
59642	59656	59637	59637	I	0	” The sound of male footsteps in the hall broke up the colloquy . “
59671	59675	59664	59667	a crowd of people	1543	” exclaimed Hadria , “
59703	59704	59664	59667	a crowd of people	1543	” “
59710	59720	59664	59667	a crowd of people	1543	” enquired Valeria , astonished at so much emotion . “
59745	59746	59734	59734	I	0	” “
59755	59768	59769	59769	My	0	” suggested Miss Du Prel . Hadria laughed and opened the door . “
59780	59781	59772	59772	I	0	” “
59788	59792	59785	59786	only one	1549	” Temperley stared . “
59802	59806	59793	59793	I	0	” he said . “
59816	59824	59809	59809	you	159	” cried the mistress of the house , “
59836	59837	59831	59834	Wordsworth 's little girl	1552	” “
59851	59852	59840	59840	you	0	” “
59867	59934	59860	59860	his	1553	” Hubert Temperley turned away in annoyance . He used to be amused by his wife 's flippancy before her marriage , but he had long since grown to dislike it . He retired to get out some wine , while Hadria went forward to welcome the guest , who now came in from the garden , where he had lingered to talk to the children . “
60028	60029	60019	60019	We	1554	” “
60047	60086	60019	60019	We	1554	” cried Mr. Fleming , pulling at his yellowish whiskers . He was a man of about five - and - thirty , of medium height , dressed in knickerbockers and Norfolk jacket that had seen some service . “
60092	60096	60097	60097	I	0	” asked Hubert . “
60119	60127	60117	60117	Sanders	168	” Hubert gave a gesture of annoyance . “
60138	60139	60117	60117	Sanders	168	” “
60144	60150	60117	60117	Sanders	168	” said his wife hopelessly . “
60156	60157	60158	60158	My	0	” “
60172	60173	60174	60174	I	0	” “
60240	60258	60263	60263	I	0	” Hadria was just turning to seek this misplaced genius , when she paused in the doorway . “
60268	60269	60265	60265	Sapphira	169	” “
60289	60290	60287	60287	Hadria	211	” “
60313	60314	60315	60315	She	1504	” “
60324	60430	60315	60315	She	1504	” Temperley did not look overjoyed . There had never been much cordiality between him and Valeria since the afternoon when they had met at Dunaghee , and found their sentiments in hopeless opposition . Miss Du Prel took no interest in Hubert , though she admired his character . She had every wish to make herself agreeable to him , but her efforts in that direction were somewhat what neutralized by an incurable absence of mind . If she was not interested , as Hadria said , she was seldom affable . Possibly Hubert 's request to her , years ago at Dunaghee , to “
60435	60441	60315	60315	She	1504	” had not been forgiven . “
60449	60516	60517	60517	I	0	” The exclamation was in consequence of Miss Du Prel 's appearing at the door of the library , whence she surveyed the group with absent - minded intentness . Valeria woke up with a start , and responded to Hubert 's greeting in an erratic fashion , replying tragically , to a casual enquiry as to her health , that she had been frightfully ill . “
60528	60552	60553	60553	Valeria	109	” she added in a disgusted tone , whereat Hadria heartlessly laughed , and hurried the visitor upstairs to help her to unpack . “
60555	60586	60553	60553	Valeria	109	” said Mrs. Temperley , while that lady was confusedly trying to disentangle hat and hair , hat - pin and head , without involving the entire system in a common ruin—“Valeria
60687	60697	60672	60672	he	159	” Hadria was not allowed to finish the sentence . “
60713	60721	60653	60653	he	159	” said Miss Du Prel . A few “
60725	60786	60653	60653	he	159	” as the hostess dejectedly described the fare , had been supplemented with vegetables , fruit , and impromptu preparations of eggs , and the luncheon was pronounced excellent and ample . Miss Du Prel said that she hoped the butcher would always forget to send the meat . She liked these imaginative meals . Temperley purposely misunderstood her to say “
60790	60821	60822	60822	I	0	” and hoped that next time she came , Hadria would not have an oratorio in course of composition . Miss Du Prel expressed a fiery interest in the oratorio . “
60834	61204	60822	60822	I	0	” Temperley explained suavely . Hadria watched the encounter with a mingled sense of amusement and discomfort . Valeria was in no danger . To be morally crushed by an adversary , it is necessary that one should be at least aware that the adversary is engaged in crushing one : a consciousness that was plainly denied to Miss Du Prel . Many a man far less able than Hubert had power to interest her , while he could not even hold her attention . She used to complain to Professor Fortescue that Temperley 's ideas never seemed to have originated in his own brain : they had been imported ready - made . Hubert was among the many who shrink and harden into mental furrows as time passes . What he had thought at twenty , at thirty - five had acquired sanctity and certainty , from having been the opinion of Hubert Temperley for all those favoured years . He had no suspicion that the views which he cherished in so dainty and scholarly a fashion were simply an edition de luxe of the views of everybody else . But his wife had made that discovery long ago . He smiled at the views of everybody else : his own were put forth as something choice and superior . He had the happy knack of being bourgeois with the air of an artist . If one could picture one 's grocer weighing out sugar in a Spanish cloak and brigand 's hat , it would afford an excellent symbol of his spiritual estate . To be perfectly commonplace in a brilliantly original way , is to be notable after all . Mr. Fleming seemed puzzled by Miss Du Prel , at whom he glanced uneasily from time to time , wondering what she would say next . At Craddock Dene , ladies usually listened with a more or less breathless deference when Temperley spoke . This new - comer seemed recklessly independent . Mrs. Temperley endeavoured to lead the conversation in ways of peace , but Valeria was evidently on the war - path . Temperley was polite and ironical , with undermeanings for Hadria 's benefit . “
61223	61228	61220	61220	I	0	” he said serenely . “
61251	61252	61245	61245	you	1574	” “
61272	61273	61275	61275	you	1574	” “
61312	61313	61314	61314	I	0	” “
61325	61331	61314	61314	I	0	” observed Miss Du Prel . “
61342	61354	61335	61335	you	1574	” he retorted . Mrs. Temperley gave the signal to rise . “
61362	61366	61335	61335	you	1574	” she suggested , “
61376	61408	61335	61335	you	1574	” The brilliant sunshine and the exercise brought about a more genial mood . Only once was there anything approaching friction , and then it was Hadria herself who caused it . “
61444	61577	61335	61335	you	1574	” Hubert Temperley at once roused Miss Du Prel 's interest by the large stores of information that he had to pour forth on the history of the district , from its earliest times to the present . He recalled the days when these lands that looked so smooth and tended had been mere wastes of marsh and forest . How quickly these great changes were accomplished ! Valeria stood on the brow of a wide corn - field , looking out over the sleeping country . A century , after all , was not much more than one person 's lifetime , yet in scarcely nine of these — nine little troubled lifetimes — what incredible things had occurred in this island of ours ! How did it all come about ? “
61581	61588	61335	61335	you	1574	” Valeria remarked with sudden malice , “
61629	61630	61631	61631	You	1582	” “
61640	61654	61631	61631	You	1582	” said Hadria , lazily rolling stones down the hill with her foot . “
61707	61786	61789	61789	I	0	” Mr. Temperley 's refined appearance and manner seemed to raise an incarnate protest against this revolting picture . For some occult reason , the imagination of all was at work especially and exclusively on the figure of that polished gentleman in war - paint and feathers , sporting round the cauldron that contained the boiled earthly remains of his relations . Mr. Fleming betrayed the common thought by remarking that it would be very becoming to him . “
61822	61834	61836	61836	you	1590	” Miss Du Prel surprised her audience by this earnest aspiration . “
61842	61846	61836	61836	you	1590	” Hadria enquired . “
61859	61860	61861	61861	I	0	” “
61875	61880	61872	61873	Mrs. Temperley	154	” observed Fleming pensively . “
61891	61892	61893	61893	You	1590	” “
61898	61902	61893	61893	You	1590	” cried Valeria . “
61933	62062	62066	62066	herself	1592	” THE first break in the unity of the Fullerton family had occurred on the occasion of Hadria 's marriage . The short period that elapsed between that memorable New - Year's - Eve and the wedding had been a painful experience for Dunaghee . Hadria 's conduct had shaken her brothers ' faith in her and in all womankind . Ernest especially had suffered disillusion . He had supposed her above the ordinary , pettier weaknesses of humanity . Other fellows ' sisters had seemed to him miserable travesties of their sex compared with her . ( There was one exception only , to this rule . ) But now , what was he to think ? She had shattered his faith . If she had n't been “
62068	62217	62066	62066	herself	1592	” he would n't have minded so much ; but after all she had professed , to go and marry , and marry a starched specimen like that ! Fred was equally emphatic . For a long time he had regarded it all as a joke . He shook his head knowingly , and said that sort of thing would n't go down . When he was at length convinced , he danced with rage . He became cynical . He had no patience with girls . They talked for talking 's sake . It meant nothing . Algitha understood , better than her brothers could understand , how Hadria 's emotional nature had been caught in some strange mood , how the eloquent assurances of her lover might have half convinced her . Algitha 's own experience of proposals set her on the track of the mystery . “
62223	62233	62234	62234	One	329	” she pointed out , to her scoffing brothers . “
62302	62303	62304	62306	The more fools	1598	” “

62868	63349	62856	62856	she	211	” cried Ernest . In the early days , Miss Temperley had stayed frequently at the Red House , and Hadria had been cut off from her own family , who detested Henriette . For a year or more , there had been a fair promise of a successful adjustment of the two incongruous natures in the new conditions . They both tried to keep off dangerous ground and to avoid collisions of will . They made the most of their one common interest , although even here they soon found themselves out of sympathy . Hubert 's instincts were scholastic and lawful , Hadria was disposed to daring innovation . Her bizarre compositions shocked him painfully . The two jarred on one another , in great things and in small . The halcyon period was short - lived . The dream , such as it was , came to an end . Hubert turned to his sister , in his bewilderment and disappointment . They had both counted so securely on the effect of experience and the pressure of events to teach Hadria the desirable lesson , and they were dismayed to find that , unlike other women , she had failed to learn it . Henriette was in despair . It was she who had brought about the ill - starred union . How could she ever forgive herself ? How repair the error she had made ? Only by devoting herself to her brother , and trying patiently to bring his wife to a wiser frame of mind . A considerable time had elapsed , during which Hadria saw her brothers and sister only at long intervals . Ernest had become estranged from her , to her great grief . He was as courteous and tender in his manner to her as of yore , but there was a change , not to be mistaken . She had lost the brother of her girlhood for ever . While it bitterly grieved , it did not surprise her . She acknowledged in dismay the inconsistency of her conduct . She must have been mad ! The universal similarity in the behaviour of girls , herself included , alarmed her . Was there some external will that drove them all , in hordes , to their fate ? Were all the intricacies of event and circumstance , of their very emotion , merely the workings of that ruthless cosmic will by which the individual was hypnotised and ruled ? As usual at critical moments , Hadria had been solitary in her encounter with the elements of Fate . There were conflicts that even her sister knew nothing about , the bewilderments and temptations of a nature hampered in its action by its own voluminous qualities and its caprice . Her brothers supposed that in a short time Hadria would be “
63372	63972	62856	62856	she	211	” How different were the little local facts of life — the little chopped - up life that accumulates in odds and ends from moment to moment — from the sun - and - smoke vision of early irresponsible days ! Mrs. Fullerton was pleased with the marriage , not merely because Hubert 's father , Judge Temperley , could secure for his son a prosperous career , but because she was so thankful to see a strange , unaccountable girl like Hadria settling quietly down , with a couple of children to keep her out of mischief . That was what it had come to ! Perhaps they calculated a little too surely . Possibly even two children might not keep her entirely out of mischief . Out of what impulse of malice had Fate pitched upon the most essentially mutinous and erratic of the whole brood , for the sedatest rôle ? But perhaps Fate , too , had calculated unscientifically . Mischief was always possible , if one gave one 's mind to it . Or was she growing too old to have the spirit for thorough - going devilry ? Youth seemed rather an affair of mental outlook than of years . She felt twenty years older since her marriage . She wondered why it was that marriage did not make all women wicked,—openly and actively so . If ever there was an arrangement by which every evil instinct and every spark of the devil was likely to be aroused and infuriated , surely the customs and traditions that clustered round this estate constituted that dangerous combination ! Hardship , difficulty , tragedy could be faced , but not the humiliating , the degrading , the contemptible . Hadria had her own particular ideas as to what ought to be set down under these headings . Most women , she found , ranked certain elements very differently , with lavish use of halos and gilding in their honour , feeling perhaps , she hinted , the dire need of such external decoration . Good heavens ! Did no other woman realize the insult of it all ? Hadria knew so few women intimately ; none intimately enough to be convinced that no such revolt lay smouldering beneath their smiles . She had a lonely assurance that she had never met the sister - soul ( for such there must be by the score , as silent as she ) , who shared her rage and her detestations . Valeria , with all her native pride , regarded these as proof of a big flaw in an otherwise sound nature . Yet how deep , how passionately strong , these feelings were , how gigantic the flaw ! What possessed people that they did not see what was so brutally clear ? As young girls led forth unconscious into the battle , with a bandage over their eyes , and cotton - wool in their ears — yes , then it was inevitable that the ! should see and hear nothing . Had they been newly imported from the moon they could scarcely have less acquaintance with terrestrial conditions ; but afterwards , when ruthlessly , with the grinning assistance of the onlookers , the facts of the social scheme were cynically revealed , and the rôle imperiously allotted — with much admonition and moving appeals to conscience and religion , and all the other aides - de - camp at command — after all that , how in the name of heaven could they continue to “
63977	64614	62856	62856	she	211	” ? Was it conceivable that among the thousands of women to whom year after year the facts were disclosed , not one understood and not one — hated ? A flame sprang up in Hadria 's eyes . There must be other women somewhere at this very moment , whose whole being was burning up with this bitter , this sickening and futile hatred ! But how few , how few ! How vast was the meek majority , fattening on indignity , proud of their humiliation ! Yet how wise they were after all . It hurt so to hate — to hate like this . Submission was an affair of temperament , a gift of birth . Nature endowed with a serviceable meekness those whom she designed for insult . Yet it might not be meekness so much as mere brutal necessity that held them all in thrall — the inexorable logic of conditions . Fate knew better than to assail the victim point blank , and so put her on her guard . No ; she lured her on gently , cunningly , closing behind her , one by one , the doors of escape , persuading her , forcing her to fasten on her own tethers , appealing to a thousand qualities , good and bad ; now to a moment 's weakness or pity , now to her eternal fear of grieving others ( that was a well - worked vein ! ) , now to her instinct of self - sacrifice , now to grim necessity itself , profiting too by the increasing discouragements , the vain efforts , the physical pain and horrible weariness , the crowding of little difficulties , harassments , the troubles of others — ah ! how infinite were these ! so that there was no interval for breathing , and scarcely time or space to cope with the legions of the moment ; the horizon was black with their advancing hosts ! And this assuredly was no unique experience . Hadria remembered how she had once said that if the worst came to the worst , it would be easy to run away . To her inexperience desperate remedies had seemed so simple , so feasible — the factors of life so few and unentwined . She had not understood how prolific are our deeds , how an act brings with it a large and unexpected progeny , which surround us with new influences and force upon us unforeseen conditions . Yet frequent had been the impulse to adopt that girlish solution of the difficulty . She had no picturesque grievances of the kind that would excite sympathy . On the contrary , popular feeling would set dead against her ; she would be acting on an idea that nobody shared , not even her most intimate friend . Miss Du Prel had arrived at the conclusion that she did not understand Hadria . She had attributed many of her peculiarities to her unique education and her inexperience . Hadria had indeed changed greatly since her marriage , but not in the manner that might have been expected . On the contrary , a closer intimacy with popular social ideals had fired her with a more angry spirit of rebellion . Miss Du Prel had met examples of every kind of eccentricity , but she had never before come upon so marked an instance of this particular type . Hadria 's attitude towards life had suggested to Miss Du Prel the idea of her heroine , Caterina . She remonstrated with Hadria , assuring her that no insult towards women was intended in the general scheme of society , and that it was a mistake to regard it in so resentful a spirit . “
64626	64630	62856	62856	she	211	” Hadria exclaimed . “
64743	64763	64765	64765	you	1627	” Miss Du Prel laughed , and re - read the passage from the Politics , in some surprise . “
64776	64780	64765	64765	you	1627	” asked Hadria . “
64833	64834	64811	64811	Aristotle	174	” “
64852	64864	64811	64811	Aristotle	174	” Miss Du Prel observed pensively . Hadria pronounced the paradox , “
64877	64915	64811	64811	Aristotle	174	” Miss Du Prel could not prevail upon her to modify the assertion . Hadria pointed out that the Greeks also meant no offence in regarding their respectable women as simple reproductive agents of inferior human quality . “
64963	65103	64957	64957	one	329	” About eighteen months ago , the village had been full of talk and excitement in consequence of the birth of an heir to the house of Engleton , Lady Engleton 's mission in life being frankly regarded as unfulfilled during the previous three or four years , when she had disappointed the hopes of the family . Hadria listened scornfully . In her eyes , the crowning indignity of the whole affair was Lady Engleton 's own smiling acceptance of the position , and her complacent eagerness to produce the tardy inheritor of the property and honours . This expression of sentiment had , by some means , reached the Vicarage and created much consternation . Mrs. Walker asserted that it was right and Christian of the lady to desire that which gave every one so much pleasure . “
65110	65724	64957	64957	one	329	” Hadria had exclaimed in Henriette 's presence . Miss Temperley , after endeavouring to goad her sister - in - law into the expression of jubilant congratulations , was met by the passionate declaration that she felt more disposed to weep than to rejoice , and more disposed to curse than to weep . Obviously , Miss Temperley had reason to be uneasy about her part in bringing about her brother 's marriage . These sudden overflows of exasperated feeling had become less frequent as time went on , but the neighbours looked askance at Mrs. Temperley . Though a powder - magazine may not always blow up , one passes it with a grave consciousness of vast stores of inflammable material lying somewhere within , and who knows what spark might set the thing spouting to the skies ? When the occasional visitors had left , life in the village settled down to its normal level , or more accurately , to its normal flatness as regarded general contours , and its petty inequalities in respect to local detail . It reminded Hadria of the landscape which stretched in quiet long lines to the low horizon , while close at hand , the ground fussed and fretted itself into minor ups and downs of no character , but with all the trouble of a mountain district in its complexities of slope and hollow . Hadria suffered from a gnawing home - sickness ; a longing for the rougher , bleaker scenery of the North . The tired spirit translated the homely English country , so deeply reposeful in its spirit , into an image of dull unrest . If only those broken , stupid lines could have been smoothed out into the grandeur of a plain , Hadria thought that it would have comforted her , as if a song had moved across it with the long - stretching winds . As it was , to look from her window only meant to find repeated the trivialities of life , more picturesque indeed , but still trivialities . It was the estimable and domestic qualities of Nature that presented themselves : Nature in her most maternal and uninspired mood — Mother earth submissive to the dictatorship of man , permitting herself to be torn , and wounded , and furrowed , and harrowed at his pleasure , yielding her substance and her life to sustain the produce of his choosing , her body and her soul abandoned supine to his caprice . The sight had an exasperating effect upon Hadria . Its symbolism haunted her . The calm , sweet English landscape affected her at times with a sort of disgust . It was , perhaps , the same in kind as the far stronger sensation of disgust that she felt when she first saw Lady Engleton with her new - born child , full of pride and exultation . It was as much as she could do to shake hands with the happy mother . When Valeria expressed dismay at so strange a feeling Hadria had refused to be treated as a solitary sinner . There were plenty of fellow - culprits , she said , only they did not dare to speak out . Let Valeria study girls and judge for herself . Hadria was challenged to name a girl . Well , Algitha for one . Hadria also suspected Marion Jordan , well - drilled though she was by her dragoon of a mother . Valeria would not hear of it . Marion Jordan ! the gentlest , timidest , most typical of young English girls ! Impossible ! “
65734	65738	65725	65725	I	0	” said Hadria . “

66080	66546	66046	66046	You	0	” ON the lawn of the Red House , a little group was collected under the big walnut tree . The sunlight fell through the leaves on the singing tea - kettle and the cups and saucers , and made bright patches on the figures and the faces assembled round the tea - table . Hubert Temperley had again brought his friend Joseph Fleming , in the forlorn hope , he said , of being able to give him something to eat and drink . Ernest and Algitha and Fred were of the party . They had come down from Saturday till Monday . Ernest was studying for the Bar . Fred had entered a merchant 's office in the city , and hated his work cordially . Miss Du Prel was still at the Red House . Lady Engleton had called by chance this afternoon , and Mrs. Walker , the vicar 's wife , with two of her countless daughters , had come by invitation . Mrs. Walker was a middle - aged , careworn , rather prim - looking woman . Lady Engleton was handsome . Bright auburn hair waved back in picturesque fashion from a piquant face , and constituted more than half her claim to beauty . The brown eyes were bright and vivacious . The mouth was seldom quite shut . It scarcely seemed worth while , the loquacious lady had confessed . She showed a delicate taste in dress . Shades of brown and russet made a fine harmony with her auburn hair , and the ivory white and fresh red of her skin . She and Temperley always enjoyed a sprightly interchange of epigrams . Lady Engleton had the qualities that Hubert had admired in Hadria before their marriage , and she was entirely free from the other characteristics that had exasperated him so desperately since that hideous mistake that he had made . Lady Engleton had originality and brilliancy , but she knew how to combine these qualities with perfect obedience to the necessary conventions of life . She had the sparkle of champagne , without the troublesome tendency of that delicate beverage to break bounds , and brim over in iridescent , swelling , joyous foam , the discreet edges of such goblets as custom might decree for the sunny vintage . Lady Engleton sparkled , glowed , nipped even at times , was of excellent dry quality , but she never frothed over . She always knew where to stop ; she had the genius of moderation . She stood to Hadria as a correct rendering of a cherished idea stands to a faulty one . She made Hubert acutely feel his misfortune , and shewed him his lost hope , his shattered ideal . “
66552	66564	66046	66046	You	0	” he enquired , as he handed Lady Engleton her tea . “
66618	66634	66635	66635	Your	1645	” Lady Engleton broke into the light laugh that had become almost mechanical with her . “
66646	66650	66635	66636	Your friends	1648	” said Temperley . “
66671	66675	66661	66661	I	0	” she said . “

66733	66757	66717	66717	one	329	” said Temperley with a sigh . Lady Engleton admired Algitha , who was standing with Ernest a little apart from the group . “
66775	66803	66804	66804	Algitha	81	” Lady Engleton was too discreet to say that Mrs. Temperley lacked the look of contentment and serenity that was so marked in her sister 's face . “
66811	66820	66806	66809	a thoroughly sensible girl	1654	” said the brother - in - law . “
66842	66856	66839	66840	Mr. Temperley	118	” observed the vicar 's wife when her host turned to address her . “
66859	66863	66839	66840	Mr. Temperley	118	” he said , “
66907	66908	66932	66932	you	1645	” “
66915	66920	66932	66932	you	1645	” assented Mrs. Walker . “
66942	66943	66944	66944	Darling	180	” “
66945	67032	67034	67034	you	1645	” did what was required in a business - like manner , and stood by , while the lady discovered in him a speaking likeness to his parents , to his Aunt Algitha and his Uncle Fred , not to mention the portrait of his great - grandfather , the Solicitor - General , that hung in the dining - room . The child seemed thoroughly accustomed to be thought the living image of various relations , and he waited indifferently till the list was ended . “
67058	67063	67042	67043	Professor Fortescue	116	” said Lady Engleton . “
67072	67073	67042	67043	Professor Fortescue	116	” “
67081	67086	67074	67075	Professor Fortescue	116	” remarked Mrs. Walker . “

67139	67259	67294	67294	he	181	” Lady Engleton explained that there was some prospect of the house being let at last to a friend and colleague of the Professor . Mrs. Walker doubtless would remember Professor Theobald , who used to come and stay at Craddock Place rather frequently some years ago , a big man with beard and moustache , very learned and very amusing . Mrs. Walker remembered him perfectly . Her husband had been so much interested in his descriptions of a tour in Palestine , all through the scenes of the New Testament . He was a great archæologist . Was he really coming to the Priory ? How very delightful . John would be so glad to hear it . “

67684	67689	67681	67682	Poor woman	4273	” said Lady Engleton . “
67703	67934	67939	67940	Mr. Fleming	159	” He pulled himself together , and his face lighted up . On that subject he could speak for hours . Of Joseph Fleming his friends all said : The best fellow in the world . A kinder heart had no man . He lived on his little property from year 's end to year 's end , for the sole and single end of depriving the pheasants and partridges which he bred upon the estate , of their existence . He was a confirmed bachelor , living quietly , and taking the world as he found it ( seeing that there was a sufficiency of partridges in good seasons ) ; trusting that there was a God above who would not let the supply run short , if one honestly tried to do one 's duty and lived an upright life , harming no man , and women only so much as was strictly honourable and necessary . He spoke ill of no one . He was diffident of his own powers , except about sport , wherein he knew himself princely , and cherished that sort of respect for woman , thoroughly sincere , which assigns to her a pedestal in a sheltered niche , and offers her homage on condition of her staying where she is put , even though she starve there , solitary and esteemed . “
67957	67962	67963	67963	She	1698	” said Lady Engleton . “

68128	68185	68115	68115	you	162	” Lady Engleton , after asking the authoress to explain exactly what she meant by her last book , enquired if she had the latest news of Professor Fortescue . Lady Engleton had heard , with regret , that he had been greatly worried about that troublesome nephew whom he had educated and sent to Oxford . “
68195	68201	68202	68203	Ungrateful creature	1700	” Miss Du Prel said . “

68425	68478	68413	68413	I	0	” Miss Du Prel answered . Ernest surprised everyone by suggesting that possibly humanity was well served , in the long run , by reminding it of the responsibility that goes with power , and by giving it an object lesson in the decent treatment of those who ca n't defend themselves . “

68577	68588	68589	68590	Mrs. Temperley	154	” observed Ernest . Lady Engleton gave a little scream . “
68612	68669	68604	68604	He	1710	” Ernest laughed , and protested . Lady Engleton pretended to be mortally offended . Mrs. Temperley was sorry she could give no redress . She had suffered from Ernest 's painful frankness from her youth upwards . The conversation grew discursive . Lady Engleton enjoyed the pastime of lightly touching the edges of what she called “
68671	68723	68724	68724	Your	154	” thought . She sought the society of people like the two Professors and Miss Du Prel , in order to hear what dreadful and delightful things they really would say . She read all the new books , and went to the courageous plays that Mrs. Walker would n't mention . “
68740	68744	68736	68738	Miss Du Prel	109	” she said . “

68906	68927	68932	68932	you	1718	” The vicar 's wife said she thought she must be going home . Her husband would be expecting her . “
68954	68960	68937	68938	Mrs. Walker	162	” Mrs. Walker yielded uneasily . “
68976	68981	68968	68968	her	173	” Lady Engleton continued , “
69056	69182	69194	69194	Caterina	173	” Miss Du Prel said that the book showed , if it showed anything , that one must be true to one 's own standard , and not attempt to respect an ideal in practice that one despises in theory . We are bound , she asserted , to produce that which is most individual within us ; to be ourselves , and not a poor imitation of someone else ; to dare even apparent wrong - doing , rather than submit to live a life of devotion to that which we can not believe . Mrs. Walker suggested to her daughters that they might go and have a look at the rose - garden , but the daughters preferred to listen to the conversation . “
69187	69193	69194	69194	Caterina	173	” said the practical Algitha , “
69222	69235	69218	69218	she	173	” Miss Du Prel thought that a compromise might have been made . “
69249	69333	69334	69334	I	0	” Valeria was impatient of difficulties . It was not necessary that a woman should leave her home in order to be true to her conscience . It was the best method in Caterina 's case , but not in all . Miss Du Prel did not explain very clearly what she meant . Women made too much of difficulties , she thought . Somehow people had managed to overcome obstacles . Look at — and then followed a list of shining examples . “
69346	69351	69336	69336	you	1723	” said Mrs. Temperley . “
69362	69363	69352	69353	These women	1726	” “
69368	69377	69352	69353	These women	1726	” Lady Engleton agreed , with a laugh , “
69391	69392	69379	69379	women	606	” “
69429	69436	69379	69379	women	606	” Mrs. Temperley made this comparison . “
69464	69473	69474	69474	One	329	” Mrs. Walker looked at Algitha in dismay . “
69486	69490	69474	69474	One	329	” added Algitha , “
69504	69507	69509	69510	Mrs. Temperley	154	” Only , ”
69512	69538	69509	69510	Mrs. Temperley	154	“ if they do venture upon their own dreadful deed — the deed demanded by their particular modern predicament — then we all shriek vigorously . ”
69539	69550	69552	69553	Lady Engleton	176	“ Oh , we shriek less than we used to , ”
69555	69573	69552	69553	Lady Engleton	176	“ It is quite a relief to be able to retain one 's respectability on easier terms . ”
69574	69661	69509	69510	Mrs. Temperley	154	“ In such a case as Miss Du Prel depicts ? I doubt it . Caterina , in real life , would have a lively story to tell . How selfish we should think her ! How we should point to the festoons of bleeding hearts that she had wounded — a dripping cordon round the deserted home ! No ; I believe Miss Du Prel herself would be horrified at her own Caterina if she came upon her unexpectedly in somebody 's drawing - room . ”
69667	69688	69689	69690	Lady Engleton	176	“ Of course , a great deal is to be said for the popular way of looking at the matter , ”
69693	69766	69689	69690	Lady Engleton	176	“ This fascinating heroine must have caused a great deal of real sorrow , or at least she would have caused it , were it not that her creator had considerably removed all relatives , except a devoted couple of unorthodox parents , who are charmed at her decision to scandalize society , and wonder why she does n't do it sooner . Parents like that do n't grow on every bush . ”
69829	69837	69839	69839	Algitha	81	“ But why should the husband suffer ? ”
69841	69849	69839	69839	Algitha	81	“ Caterina 's husband cordially detested her . ”
69850	69864	69866	69867	Mrs. Temperley	154	“ It is customary to regard the occasion as one proper for suffering , ”
69869	69880	69866	69867	Mrs. Temperley	154	“ and every well - regulated husband would suffer accordingly . ”
69881	69884	69886	69887	Lady Engleton	176	“ Clearly , ”
69889	69906	69886	69887	Lady Engleton	176	“ When the world congratulates us we rejoice , when it condoles with us we weep . ”
69907	69918	69920	69920	Algitha	81	“ That at least , would not affect the children , ”
69922	69934	69920	69920	Algitha	81	“ I do n't see why of necessity they should suffer . ”
69935	69950	69951	69952	Mrs. Temperley	154	“ Their share of the woe would be least of all , I think , ”
69955	70009	69951	69952	Mrs. Temperley	154	“ What ogre is going to ill - treat them ? And since few of us know how to bring up so much as an earth - worm reasonably , I ca n't see that it matters so very much which particular woman looks after the children . Any average fool would do . ”
70018	70050	70010	70011	Mrs. Walker	162	“ The children would have the usual chances of their class ; neither more nor less , as it seems to me , for lack of a maternal burnt - offering . ”
70090	70101	70103	70104	Lady Engleton	176	“ Really you will depopulate this village , Mrs. Temperley , ”
70109	70146	70103	70104	Lady Engleton	176	“ it is quite dangerous to bring up a family within your reach . There will be a general exodus . I must be going myself , or I sha n't have an orthodox sentiment left . ”
70287	70313	70278	70278	Valeria	109	“ To try and pump information out of a friend ! Why not listen at the key - hole , and be done with it ! ”
70336	70355	70357	70357	Hadria	211	“ I have learnt not to expect a nice sense of honour from superior persons with unimpeachable sentiments , ”
70359	70367	70369	70369	Valeria	109	“ You are certainly a good hater ! ”
70375	70390	70369	70369	Valeria	109	“ Oh , I do n't hate Henriette ; I only hate unimpeachable sentiments . ”
70435	70441	70442	70442	she	142	“ And so I growl , ”
70466	70477	70478	70478	everyone	3726	“ Hadria will be so different when she has children , ”
70779	70797	70769	70770	Mrs. Temperley	154	“ I suppose no one knows who the father is ? He has not acknowledged the child ! ”
70864	70875	70877	70879	Miss Du Prel	109	“ You are the most inconsistent woman I ever met ! ”
70881	70885	70877	70879	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Why inconsistent ? ”
70886	70915	70829	70829	her	154	“ You say that children have been the means , from time immemorial , of enslaving women , and here you go and adopt one of your enslavers ! ”
70916	70924	70925	70925	Valeria	109	“ But this child is not legitimate . ”
70928	70985	70925	70925	Valeria	109	“ Whatever the wrongs of Ellen Jervis , at least there were no laws written , and unwritten , which demanded of her as a duty that she should become the mother of this child . In that respect she escapes the ignominy reserved for the married mother who produces children that are not even hers . ”
70986	71000	71001	71003	Miss Du Prel	109	“ You do manage to ferret out the unpleasant aspects of our position ! ”
71006	71030	71001	71003	Miss Du Prel	109	“ But I want to know why you do this , Hadria . It is good of you , but totally unlike you . ”
71031	71037	71039	71039	Hadria	211	“ You are very polite ! ”
71041	71063	71039	71039	Hadria	211	“ Why should I not lay up store for myself in heaven , as well as Mrs. Walker and the rest ? ”
71064	71079	71001	71003	Miss Du Prel	109	“ You were not thinking of heaven when you did this deed , Hadria . ”
71080	71091	71001	71003	Miss Du Prel	109	“ No ; I was thinking of the other place . ”
71092	71106	71001	71003	Miss Du Prel	109	“ And do you hope to get any satisfaction out of your protégée ? ”
71112	71216	71001	71003	Miss Du Prel	109	“ I do n't know . The child is the result of great sorrow and suffering ; it is the price of a woman 's life ; a woman who offended the world , having lived for nearly forty weary obedient years , in circumstances dreary enough to have turned twenty saints into as many sinners . No ; I am no Lady Bountiful . I feel in defending this child — a sorry defence I know — that I am , in so far , opposing the world and the system of things that I hate—. Ah ! how I hate it ! ”
71217	71227	71228	71228	Hadria	211	“ Is it then hatred that prompts the deed ? ”
71247	71424	71228	71228	Hadria	211	“ Can you ever quite unravel your own motives , Valeria ? Hatred ? Yes ; there is a large ingredient of hatred . Without it , probably this poor infant would have been left to struggle through life alone , with a mill - stone round its neck , and a miserable constitution into the bargain . I hope to rescue its constitution . But that poor woman 's story touched me closely . It is so hard , so outrageous ! The emptiness of her existence ; the lack of outlet for her affections ; the endless monotony ; and then the sudden new interest and food for the starved emotions ; the hero - worship that is latent in us all ; and then — good heavens!—for a touch of poetry , of romance in her life , she would have been ready to believe in the professions of the devil himself — and this man was a very good understudy for the devil ! Ah ! If ever I should meet him ! ”
71425	71431	71432	71432	Valeria	109	“ What would you do ? ”
71436	71440	71442	71442	Hadria	211	“ Avenge her , ”
71447	71456	71442	71442	Hadria	211	“ Easier said than done , my dear ! ”
71640	71652	71654	71654	Valeria	109	“ I still fail to understand why you adopt this child , ”
71656	71665	71654	71654	Valeria	109	“ My Caterina would never have done it . ”
71666	71673	71675	71675	Hadria	211	“ The little creature interests me , ”
71677	71714	71675	71675	Hadria	211	“ It is a tiny field for the exercise of the creative forces . Every one has some form of active amusement . Some like golf , others flirtation . I prefer this sort of diversion . ”
71715	71733	71734	71734	Hadria	211	“ But you have your own children to interest you , surely far more than this one . ”
71742	71797	71734	71734	Hadria	211	“ They represent to me the insult of society — my own private and particular insult , the tribute exacted of my womanhood . It is through them that I am to be subdued and humbled . Just once in a way , however , the thing does not quite ‘ come off . ’ ”
71798	71810	71654	71654	Valeria	109	“ What has set you on edge so , I wonder . ”
71811	71819	71675	71675	Hadria	211	“ People , traditions , unimpeachable sentiments . ”
71820	71829	71830	71830	Valeria	109	“ Yours are not unimpeachable at any rate ! ”
71834	71853	71830	71830	Valeria	109	“ Caterina is an angel compared with you , and yet my publisher has his doubts about her . ”
71854	71865	71867	71867	Hadria	211	“ Caterina would do as I do , I know , ”
71869	71932	71867	71867	Hadria	211	“ Those who are looked at askance by the world appeal to my instincts . I shall be able to teach this child , perhaps , to strike a blow at the system which sent her mother to a dishonoured grave , while it leaves the man for whose sake she risked all this , in peace and the odour of sanctity . ”
72469	72474	72475	72475	she	154	“ Handsome and clever ? ”
72478	72532	72475	72475	she	154	“ Is that all you can say , Mr. Fleming ? When you set about it , I think you might provide a little better food for one 's parental sentiment . I suppose you will go and tell Mrs. Walker that her dozen and a half are all handsome and clever too ! ”
72533	72542	72544	72545	Mr. Fleming	159	“ Not so handsome and clever as yours , ”
72556	72563	72564	72564	Hadria	211	“ What wretched poverty of expression ! ”
72567	72581	72564	72564	Hadria	211	“ I ask for bread , and truly you give me a stone . ”
72589	72602	72603	72603	he	159	“ I — I admire your boys immensely , as you know , ”
72606	72613	72603	72603	he	159	“ Not enough , not enough . ”
72614	72621	72564	72564	Hadria	211	“ What can I say more ? ”
72622	72657	72603	72603	he	159	“ A mother has to find in her children all that she can hope to find in life , and she naturally desires to make the most of them , do n't you see ? ”
72658	72666	72668	72668	Joseph	159	“ Ah ! yes , quite so , ”
72671	72720	72668	72668	Joseph	159	“ Nobody , I suppose , likes to be commonplace all round ; one must have some poetry somewhere — so most women idealize their children , and if other people wo n't help them in the effort , do n't you see ? it is most discouraging . ”
72721	72729	72730	72730	Joseph	159	“ Are you chaffing , or what ? ”
72733	72743	72730	72730	Joseph	159	“ No , indeed ; I am perilously serious . ”
72744	72759	72761	72761	Joseph	159	“ I can well understand how a mother must get absorbed in her children , ”
72763	72774	72761	72761	Joseph	159	“ I suppose it 's a sort of natural provision . ”
72775	72791	72793	72793	Hadria	211	“ Think of Mrs. Allan with her outrageous eight — all making mud - pies ! ”
72795	72881	72793	72793	Hadria	211	“ a magnificent ‘ natural provision ! ’ A small income , a small house , with those pervasive eight . You know the stampede when one goes to call ; the aroma of bread and butter ( there are few things more inspiring ) ; the cook always about to leave ; Mrs. Allan with a racking headache . It is indeed not difficult to understand how a mother would get absorbed in her children . Why , their pinafores alone would become absorbing . ”
72882	72886	72888	72889	Mr. Fleming	159	“ Quite so , ”
72900	72930	72888	72889	Mr. Fleming	159	“ Oh , by the way , have you heard that the Priory is really to be inhabited at last ? Professor Theobald has almost decided to take it . ”
72931	72962	72793	72793	Hadria	211	“ Really ? that will be exciting for Craddock Dene . We shall have another household to dissect and denounce . Providence watches over us all , I verily believe . ”
72963	72968	72969	72969	Joseph	159	“ I hope so , ”
72973	72980	72981	72981	Hadria	211	“ Truly I hope so too , ”
72988	72995	72981	72981	Hadria	211	“ for indeed we need it . ”
73042	73045	73029	73029	he	159	“ instinct . ”
73536	73549	73532	73532	Algitha	81	“ since there she was , and there was no helping it . ”
73550	73560	73561	73561	she	211	“ I will never make the best of things , ”
73564	73576	73561	73561	she	211	“ I know nothing that gives such opportunities to the Devil . ”
73585	73591	73593	73593	Algitha	81	“ What do you mean ? ”
73595	73609	73593	73593	Algitha	81	“ Surely the enemy of good has most hold over the discontented spirit . ”
73623	73645	73610	73610	Hadria	211	“ It is only the discontented ocean that remains , for all its storms , fresh and sane to the end . ”
73707	73720	73721	73721	she	211	“ But then there is this sickly feminine conscience to deal with ! ”
73724	73745	73721	73721	she	211	“ It clings to the worst of us still , and prevents the wholesome big catastrophes that might bring salvation . ”
73885	73895	73897	73897	Fred	83	“ Where did you fall in with that casket ? ”
73899	73909	73911	73911	Ernest	86	“ And who was the architect of the cathedral ? ”
73913	73936	73911	73911	Ernest	86	“ This casket , as you call it , was presented to me by Mrs. Gordon . The cathedral I designed myself . ”
73952	73955	73957	73957	Ernest	86	“ Gothic , ”
73959	73963	73957	73957	Ernest	86	“ pure Gothic . ”
73964	73976	73978	73978	Fred	83	“ I should have described it as ‘ Early Perpendicular , ’ ”
73980	74013	73978	73978	Fred	83	“ Do n't display your neglected education ; it 's beyond all question Gothic . Look at the steeple and the gargoyles and the handsome vegetation . Ruskin would revel in it ! ”
74014	74024	74026	74026	Algitha	81	“ Are you really going about in that thing ? ”
74074	74094	74095	74095	Ernest	86	“ Well , I never before met a woman who would deliberately flout her neighbours by wearing preposterous millinery ! ”
74139	74142	74134	74135	Mrs. Jordan	179	“ loud . ”
74210	74225	74227	74228	the vicar	4965	“ And so at last we may hope that the Priory will be inhabited , ”
74232	74238	74239	74239	she	4966	“ Of course you know , ”
74257	74265	74239	74239	she	4966	“ that Mrs. Fortescue committed suicide there . ”
74657	74660	74648	74648	She	1858	“ rights . ”
74661	74683	74684	74684	he	4071	“ Morally , I have no rights , except such as you choose to give me of your own free will , ”
74687	74694	74648	74648	She	1858	“ I am not your gaoler . ”
74695	74712	74713	74713	Valeria	109	“ And even that did not penetrate to her better nature till it was too late , ”
74716	74827	74713	74713	Valeria	109	“ But after the mischief was done , that phrase seems to have stung her to torment . Her training had blinded her , as one is blinded in coming out of darkness into a bright light . She was used to narrower hearts and smaller brains . Her last letter — a terrible record of the miseries of remorse — shews that she recognized at last what sort of a man he was whose heart she had broken . But even in her repentance , she was unable to conquer her egotism . She could not face the horrors of self - accusation ; she preferred to kill herself . ”
74828	74834	74836	74836	Hadria	211	“ What a shocking story ! ”
74838	74901	74836	74836	Hadria	211	“ And all the more so because the Professor clings to her memory so faithfully . He blames himself for everything . He ought , he says , to have realized better the influence of her training ; he ought to have made her understand that he could not assert what she called his ‘ rights ’ without insulting her and himself . ”
74902	74927	74929	74929	Hadria	211	“ Whenever one hears anything new about the Professor , it is always something that makes one admire and love him more than ever ! ”
75350	75377	75348	75348	his	1896	“ What matters it ? One woman 's destiny is but a small affair . If I were you I would make less fuss about it . ”
75547	75568	75574	75574	Hadria	211	“ I starve for the sight of a true and simple face , for the grasp of a brotherly hand . ”
75569	75572	75574	75574	Hadria	211	“ You ? ”
75576	75686	75574	75574	Hadria	211	“ There are so few , so very few , where the throng is thick and the battle fierce . It saddens me to see good fellows trampling one another down , growing hard and ungenerous . And then the vulgarity , the irreverence : they are almost identical , I think . One grows very sick and sorry at times amidst the cruelty and the baseness that threaten to destroy one 's courage and one 's hope . I know that human nature has in it a germ of nobility that will save it , in the long run , but meanwhile things seem sadly out of joint . ”
75687	75696	75698	75698	Hadria	211	“ Is that the order of the universe ? ”
75700	75715	75716	75716	he	4071	“ No , I think it is rather the disorder of man 's nature , ”
75761	75769	75770	75770	he	4071	“ I used to avoid the place , ”
75773	75792	75770	75770	he	4071	“ but I made a mistake . I have resolved to face the memories : it is better . ”
75816	75829	75830	75830	he	4071	“ I have often wished to speak to you about my wife , ”
75847	75871	75872	75872	He	4071	“ I have felt that you would understand the whole sad story , and I hoped that some day you would know it . ”
75878	75971	75872	75872	He	4071	“ It has often been a comfort to me to remember that you were in the world , for it made me feel less lonely . I felt in you some new — what can I call it ? instinct , impulse , inspiration , which ran you straight against all the hardest stone walls that intersect the pathways of this ridiculous old world . And , strange to say , it is the very element in you that sets you at loggerheads with others , that enabled me to understand you . ”
75976	76082	75972	75972	Hadria	211	“ To tell you the truth , I have always wondered why women have never felt as I am sure you feel towards life . You remember that day at Dunaghee when you were so annoyed at my guessing your thoughts . They were unmistakeable to one who shared them . Your sex has always been a riddle to me ; there seemed to be something abject in their nature , even among the noblest of them . But you are no riddle . While I think you are the least simple woman I ever met , you are to me the easiest to understand . ”
76083	76095	76097	76097	Hadria	211	“ And yet I remember your telling me the exact contrary , ”
76099	76135	76097	76097	Hadria	211	“ That was before I had caught the connecting thread . Had I been a woman , I believe that life and my place in it would have affected me exactly as it affects you . ”
76168	76178	76179	76179	he	1912	“ I wish my wife had possessed your friendship , ”
76182	76191	76179	76179	he	1912	“ I believe you would have saved us . ”
76212	76243	76192	76192	He	1912	“ I almost feel as if she were near us now on this old terrace that she loved so . She planted these roses herself — how they have grown ! ”
76267	76458	76459	76459	Hadria	211	“ You doubtless know the bare facts of her life , but nothing is so misleading as bare fact . My wife was one of the positive natures , capable of great nobility , but liable to glaring error and sin ! She held ideas passionately . She had the old barbaric notion that a husband was a sort of master , and must assert his authority and rights . It was the result of her training . I saw that a great development was before her . I pleased myself with the thought of watching and helping it . She was built on a grand scale . To set her free from prejudice , from her injustice to herself , from her dependence on me to teach her to breathe deep with those big lungs of hers and think bravely with that capacious brain : that was my dream . I hoped to hear her say to me some day , what I fear no woman has yet been able to say to her husband , ‘ The day of our marriage was the birthday of my freedom . ’ ”
76609	76937	76603	76603	herself	211	“ It was in there , in the old drawing - room , where we had sat together evening after evening , that they found her dead , the very type of all that is brilliant and exquisite and living . To me she was everything . All my personal happiness was centred in her . I cared for nothing so long as she was in the same world as myself , and I might love her . In the darkness that followed , I was brought face to face with the most terrible problems of human fate . I had troubled myself but little about the question of the survival of the personality after death ; I had been pre - occupied with life . Now I realized out of what human longings and what human desperation our religions are built . For one gleam of hope that we should meet again — what would I not have given ? But it never came . The trend of my thought made all such hopes impossible . I have grown charier of the word ‘ impossible ’ now . We know so infinitesimally little . I had to learn to live on comfortless . All that was strongly personal in me died . All care about myself went out suddenly , as in other cases I think it goes out slowly , beaten down by the continued buffetings of life . I gave myself to my work , and then a curious decentralizing process took place . I ceased to be the point round which the world revolved , in my own consciousness . We all start our career as pivots , if I am not mistaken . The world span , and I , in my capacity of atomic part , span with it . I mean that this was a continuous , not an occasional state of consciousness . After that came an unexpected peace . ”
76938	76951	76953	76953	Hadria	211	“ You have travelled a long and hard road to find it ! ”
76955	76961	76962	76962	he	1920	“ Not a unique fate , ”
76968	76995	76962	76962	he	1920	“ It must be a terrible process that quite kills the personal in one , it is so strong . With me the element is clamorous . ”
76996	77004	76603	76603	herself	211	“ It has its part to play . ”
77005	77031	76962	76962	he	1920	“ Surely the gods must be jealous of human beings . Why did they destroy the germ of such happiness as you might have had ? ”
77032	77049	77050	77051	The Professor	4071	“ The stern old law holds for ever ; wrong and error have to be expiated . ”
77164	77417	77439	77439	Hadria	211	“ When death put an end to their wretchedness , one would suppose that the evil of their lives was worked out and over , but it was not so . The Erinnys were still unsatisfied . My poor wife became the victim of their fury . And every new light that science throws upon human life shews that this must be so . The old Greeks saw that unconscious evil - doing is punished as well as that which is conscious . These poor unselfish women , piling up their own supposed merit , at the expense of the character of their tyrants , laid up a store of misery for their descendant , my unhappy wife . Imagine the sort of training and tradition that she had to contend with ; her mother ignorant and supine , her father violent , bigoted , almost brutal . Eleanor 's nature was obscured and distorted by it . Having inherited the finer and stronger qualities of her father 's race , with much of its violence , she was going through a struggle at the time of our marriage : training , native vigour and nobility all embroiled in a desperate civil war . It was too much . There is no doubt as to the ultimate issue , but the struggle killed her . It is a common story : a character militant which meets destruction in the struggle for life . The past evil pursues and throttles the present good . ”
77418	77437	77439	77439	Hadria	211	“ This takes away the last consolation from women who have been forced to submit to evil conditions , ”
77441	77447	77449	77450	the Professor	4071	“ It is the truth , ”
77452	77481	77449	77450	the Professor	4071	“ The Erinnys are no mere fancy of the Greek mind . They are symbols of an awful fact of life that no one can afford to ignore . ”
77482	77490	77491	77491	Hadria	211	“ What insensate fools we all are ! ”
77494	77499	77491	77491	Hadria	211	“ I mean women . ”
77622	77660	77661	77661	he	4071	“ We need to feel that there is someone who believes in us , in our good faith , in our good will , one who will not judge according to outward success or failure . Remember , ”
77664	77720	77661	77661	he	4071	“ that I have that unbounded faith in you . Nothing can move it . Whatever happens and wherever you may be led by the strange chances of life , do n't forget the existence of one old friend , or imagine that anything can shake his friendship or his desire to be of service . ”
77721	77733	77735	77735	Valeria	109	“ THE worst thing about the life of you married people , ”
77737	77785	77735	77735	Valeria	109	“ is its ridiculous rigidity . It takes more energy to get the dinner delayed for a quarter of an hour in most well - regulated houses , or some slight change in routine , than to alter a frontier , or pass an Act of Parliament . ”
77789	77812	77786	77786	Hadria	211	“ Until you discovered this by personal inconvenience , you always scolded me for my disposition to jeer at the domestic scheme . ”
77813	77820	77821	77821	Valeria	109	“ It is a little geometrical , ”
77824	77844	77821	77821	Valeria	109	“ Geometrical ! It is like a gigantic ordnance map palmed off on one instead of a real landscape . ”
77845	77858	77786	77786	Hadria	211	“ Come now , to be just , say an Italian garden . ”
77859	77888	77786	77786	Hadria	211	“ That flatters it , but the simile will do . The eye sees to the end of every path , and knows that it leads to nothing . ”
77889	77908	77786	77786	Hadria	211	“ Ah ! dear Hadria , but all the pathways of the world have that very same goal . ”
77909	77983	77786	77786	Hadria	211	“ At least some of them have the good taste to wind a little , and thus disguise the fact . And think of the wild flowers one may gather by the wayside in some forest track , or among the mountain passes ; but in these prim alleys what natural thing can one know ? Brain and heart grow tame and clipped to match the hedges , or take on grotesque shapes — ”
77984	77991	77786	77786	Hadria	211	“ That one must guard against . ”
77992	78021	77786	77786	Hadria	211	“ Oh , I am sick of guarding against things . To be always warding off evil , is an evil in itself . Better let it come . ”
78029	78074	78022	78022	Valeria	109	“ One knows how twirling round in a circle makes one giddy , or following the same path stupifies . How does the polar bear feel , I wonder , after he has walked up and down in his cage for years and years ? ”
78075	78083	78085	78085	Valeria	109	“ Used to it , I imagine , ”
78087	78110	78085	78085	Valeria	109	“ But before he gets used to it , that is the bad time . And then it is all so confusing — ”
78191	78259	78182	78182	Valeria	109	“ I do n't want to allow emotion to get the better of me , Valeria . I do n't want to run rank like some overgrown weed , and so I dread the accumulation of emotion — emotion that has never had a good explosive utterance . One has to be so discreet in these Italian gardens ; no one shouts or says ‘ damn . ’ ”
78260	78271	78272	78272	Hadria	211	“ Ah ! you naturally feel out of your element . ”
78275	78296	78272	78272	Hadria	211	“ It 's all very well to take that superior tone . You do n't reside on an ordnance map . ”
78310	78336	78302	78304	Miss Du Prel	109	“ It is this dead silence that oppresses one , this hushed endurance of the travail of life . How do these women stand it ? ”
78362	78399	78302	78304	Miss Du Prel	109	“ And yet , Valeria , you have often professed to envy me , because I had what you called a place in life — as if a place in Craddock Dene were the same thing ! ”
78400	78413	78302	78304	Miss Du Prel	109	“ It is well that you do not mean all you say . ”
78414	78421	78422	78422	Valeria	109	“ Or say all I mean . ”
78433	78447	78422	78422	Valeria	109	“ I do n't think anyone will ever quite understand you , Hadria . ”
78448	78526	78527	78529	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Including perhaps myself . I sometimes fancy that when it became necessary to provide me with a disposition , the material had run out , for the moment , nothing being left but a few remnants of other people 's characters ; so a living handful of these was taken up , roughly welded together , and then the mixture was sent whirling into space , to boil and sputter itself out as best it might . ”
78535	78567	78527	78529	Miss Du Prel	109	“ I see that you are incongruously situated , but do n't you think that you may be wrong yourself ? Do n't you think you may be making a mistake ? ”
78574	78734	78568	78568	Hadria	211	“ Not only do I think I may be wrong , but I do n't see how — unless by pure chance — I can be anything else . For I ca n't discover what is right . I see women all round me actuated by this frenzied sense of duty ; I see them toiling submissively at their eternal treadmill ; occupying their best years in the business of filling their nurseries ; losing their youth , narrowing their intelligence , ruining their husbands , and clouding their very moral sense at last . Well , I know that such conduct is supposed to be right and virtuous . But I ca n't see it . It impresses me simply as stupid and degrading . And from my narrow little point of observation , the more I see of life , the more hopelessly involved become all questions of right and wrong where our confounded sex is concerned . ”
78735	78744	78746	78748	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Why ? Because the standards are changing , ”
78750	78881	78746	78748	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Because — look , Valeria , our present relation to life is in itself an injury , an insult — you have never seriously denied that — and how can one make for oneself a moral code that has to lay its foundation - stone in that very injury ? And if one lays one 's foundation - stone in open ground beyond , then one 's code is out of touch with present fact , and one 's morality consists in sheer revolt all along the line . The whole matter is in confusion . You have to accept Mrs. Walker 's and Mrs. Gordon 's view of the case , plainly and simply , or you get off into a sort of morass and blunder into quicksands . ”
78882	78887	78568	78568	Hadria	211	“ Then what happens ? ”
78888	78925	78568	78568	Hadria	211	“ That 's just what I do n't know . That 's just why I say that I am probably wrong , because , in this transition period , there seems to be no clear right . ”
78926	78943	78944	78944	Valeria	109	“ To cease to believe in right and wrong would be to founder morally , altogether , ”
78947	78983	78944	78944	Valeria	109	“ I know , and yet I begin to realize how true it is that there is no such thing as absolute right or wrong . It is related to the case and the moment . ”
78984	78997	78999	79000	her friend	4123	“ This leads up to some desperate deed or other , Hadria , ”
79002	79029	78999	79000	her friend	4123	“ I have feared it , or hoped it , I scarcely know which , for some time . But you alarm me to - day . ”
79030	79086	78944	78944	Valeria	109	“ If I believed in the efficacy of a desperate deed , Valeria , I should not chafe as I do , against the conditions of the present scheme of things . If individuals could find a remedy for themselves , with a little courage and will , there would be less occasion to growl . ”
79087	79093	79176	79178	Miss Du Prel	109	“ But can they not ? ”
79094	79098	79100	79100	Hadria	211	“ Can they ? ”
79102	79169	79170	79170	Hadria	211	“ A woman without means of livelihood , breaks away from her moorings — well , it is as if a child were to fall into the midst of some gigantic machinery that is going at full speed . Let her try the feat , and the cracking of her bones by the big wheels will attest its hopelessness . And yet I long to try ! ”
79199	79266	79192	79195	Individuals here and there	1949	“ I told you years ago that Nature had chosen our sex for ill - usage . Try what we may , defeat and suffering await us , in one form or another . You are dissatisfied with your form of suffering , I with mine . A creature in pain always thinks it would be more bearable if only it were on the other side . ”
79267	79278	79280	79280	Hadria	211	“ Ah , I know you wo n't admit it , ”
79282	79388	79280	79280	Hadria	211	“ but some day we shall all see that this is the result of human cruelty and ignorance , and that it is no more ‘ intended ’ or inherently necessary than that children should be born with curvature of the spine , or rickets . Some day it will be as clear as noon , that heartless ‘ some day ’ which can never help you or me , or any of us who live now . It is we , I suppose , who are required to help the ‘ some day . ’ Only how , when we are ourselves in extremis ? ”
79389	79398	79400	79400	Valeria	109	“ The poor are helpers of the poor , ”
79402	79427	79400	79400	Valeria	109	“ But if they grow too poor , to starvation point , then they can help no more ; they can only perish slowly . ”
79428	79432	79434	79434	Valeria	109	“ I hoped , ”
79436	79449	79434	79434	Valeria	109	“ that Professor Fortescue would have poured oil upon the troubled waters . ”
79450	79473	79474	79476	Miss Du Prel	109	“ He does in one sense . But in another , he makes me feel more than ever what I am missing . ”
79488	79502	79503	79503	she	109	“ There is really nothing for it , but some deed of daring , ”
79506	79581	79503	79503	she	109	“ I believe , if only your husband could get over his horror of the scandal and talk , that a separation would be best for you both . It is not as if he cared for you . One can see he does not . You are such a strange , inconsequent being , Hadria , that I believe you would feel the parting far more than he would ( conventions apart ) . ”
79582	79588	79590	79590	Hadria	211	“ No question of it , ”
79592	79647	79590	79590	Hadria	211	“ Our disharmony , radical and hopeless as it is , does not prevent my having a strong regard for Hubert . I ca n't help seeing the admirable sides of his character . He is too irritated and aggrieved to feel anything but rancour against me . It is natural . I understand . ”
79648	79696	79697	79697	Hadria	211	“ Ah , it will only end in some disaster , if you try to reconcile the irreconcilable . Of course I think it is a great pity that you have not more of the instincts on which homes are founded , but since you have not — ”
79702	79737	79697	79697	Hadria	211	“ Do you really regret that just for once the old , old game has been played unsuccessfully ? Therein I ca n't agree with you , though I am the loser by it . ”
79763	79952	79738	79738	Hadria	211	“ It gives me a keen , fierce pleasure to know that for all their training and constraining and incitement and starvation , I have not developed masses of treacly instinct in which mind and will and every human faculty struggle , in vain , to move leg or wing , like some poor fly doomed to a sweet and sticky death . At least the powers of the world shall not prevail with me by that old device . Mind and will and every human faculty may die , but they shall not drown , in the usual applauded fashion , in seas of tepid , bubbling , up - swelling instinct . I will dare anything rather than endure that . They must take the trouble to provide instruments of death from without ; they must lay siege and starve me ; they must attack in soldierly fashion ; I will not save them the exertion by developing the means of destruction from within . There I stand at bay . They shall knock down the citadel of my mind and will , stone by stone . ”
79953	79960	79962	79964	Miss Du Prel	109	“ That is a terrible challenge ! ”
80073	80079	80081	80081	Valeria	109	“ The shadows of Fate ! ”
80095	80110	80085	80085	they	1954	“ Who are they I wonder ? Oh , Professor Fortescue , for one ! ”
80111	80125	80126	80126	He	1956	“ Lady Engleton and Joseph Fleming . The other I do n't know . ”
80233	80236	80238	80238	Valeria	109	“ That , ”
80240	80255	80238	80238	Valeria	109	“ must be Professor Theobald . He has probably come to see the house . ”
80256	80266	80268	80268	Hadria	211	“ I am sure I shall hate that man , ”
80270	80287	80268	80268	Hadria	211	“ He is not to be trusted ; what nonsense he is talking to Lady Engleton ! ”
80288	80297	80238	80238	Valeria	109	“ You ca n't hear , can you ? ”
80298	80337	80238	80238	Valeria	109	“ No ; I can see . And she laughs and smiles and bandies words with him . He is amusing certainly ; there is that excuse for her ; but I wonder how she can do it . ”
80338	80360	80268	80268	Hadria	211	“ What an extraordinary creature you are ! To take a prejudice against a man before you have spoken to him . ”
80361	80370	80372	80372	Hadria	211	“ He is cruel , he is cruel ! ”
80380	80451	80372	80372	Hadria	211	“ He is like some cunning wild animal . Look at Professor Fortescue ! his opposite pole — why it is all clearer , at this distance , than if we were under the confusing influence of their speech . See the contrast between that quiet , firm walk , and the insinuating , conceited tread of the other man . Joseph Fleming comes out well too , honest soul ! ”
80452	80466	80468	80468	Valeria	109	“ He is carrying a fishing - rod . They have been fishing , ”
80470	80489	80372	80372	Hadria	211	“ Not Professor Fortescue , I am certain . He does not find his pleasure in causing pain . ”
80490	80512	80268	80268	Hadria	211	“ This hero - worship blinds you . Depend upon it , he is not without the primitive instinct to kill . ”
80513	80530	80372	80372	Hadria	211	“ There are individual exceptions to all savage instincts , or the world would never move . ”
80531	80537	80539	80541	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Instinct rules the world , ”
80543	80559	80539	80541	Miss Du Prel	109	“ At least it is obviously neither reason nor the moral sense that rules it . ”
80560	80573	80268	80268	Hadria	211	“ Then why does it produce a Professor Fortescue now and then ? ”
80574	80580	80268	80268	Hadria	211	“ Possibly as a corrective . ”
80581	80587	80589	80589	Hadria	211	“ Or perhaps for fun , ”
80591	80617	80589	80589	Hadria	211	“ PROFESSOR THEOBALD , if you are able to resist the fascinations of this old house you are made of sterner stuff than I thought . ”
80618	80628	80268	80268	Hadria	211	“ I can never resist fascinations , Lady Engleton . ”
80629	80635	80268	80268	Hadria	211	“ Do you ever try ? ”
80636	80645	80589	80589	Hadria	211	“ My life is spent in the endeavour . ”
80646	80650	80268	80268	Hadria	211	“ How foolish ! ”
80677	80685	80686	80686	she	176	“ Do you know , Mrs. Temperley , ”
80694	80759	80686	80686	she	176	“ I have scarcely heard a serious word since our two Professors came to us . Is n't it disgraceful ? I naturally expected to be improved and enlightened , but they are both so frivolous , I ca n't keep them for a moment to any important subject . They refuse to be profound . It is I who have to be profound . ”
80760	80768	80770	80771	Professor Theobald	181	“ While we endeavour to be charming , ”
80773	80800	80770	80771	Professor Theobald	181	“ You may think that flattering , but I confess it seems to me a beggarly compliment ( as men 's to women usually are ) . ”
80801	80813	80686	80686	she	176	“ You expect too much of finite intelligence , Lady Engleton . ”
80814	80897	80898	80898	she	1962	“ This is how I am always put off ! If it were not that you are both such old friends — you are a sort of cousin I think , Professor Fortescue — I should really feel aggrieved . One has to endure so much more from relations . No , but really ; I appeal to Mrs. Temperley . When one is hungering for erudition , to be offered compliments ! Not that I can accuse Professor Fortescue of compliments , ”
80904	80957	80898	80898	she	1962	“ wild horses would not drag one from him . I angle vainly . But he is so ridiculously young . He enjoys things as if he were a schoolboy . Does one look for that in one 's Professors ? He talks of the country as if it were Paradise Regained . ”
80958	80965	80966	80966	he	1963	“ So it is to me , ”
80972	80989	80966	80966	he	1963	“ But that is not your rôle . You have to think , not to enjoy . ”
80990	81001	81002	81003	Professor Theobald	181	“ Then you must not invite us to Craddock Place , ”
81006	81014	81002	81003	Professor Theobald	181	“ As usual , a halting compliment . ”
81015	81024	81026	81027	Professor Fortescue	116	“ To take you seriously , Lady Engleton , ”
81029	81076	81026	81027	Professor Fortescue	116	“ ( though I know it is a dangerous practice ) one of the great advantages of an occasional think is to enable one to relish the joys of mental vacuity , just as the pleasure of idleness is never fully known till one has worked . ”
81077	81080	81082	81083	Lady Engleton	176	“ Ah , ”
81085	81099	81082	81083	Lady Engleton	176	“ I know I do n't extract the full flavour out of that ! ”
81100	81107	81109	81110	the Professor	4071	“ It is a neglected art , ”
81112	81186	81109	81110	the Professor	4071	“ After worrying himself with the problems of existence , as the human being is prone to do , as soon as existence is more or less secure and peaceful , a man can experience few things more enjoyable than to leave aside all problems and go out into the fields , into the sun , to feel the life in his veins , the world at the threshold of his five senses . ”
81187	81200	81082	81083	Lady Engleton	176	“ All , now you really are profound at last , Professor ! ”
81201	81212	81283	81283	she	109	“ I thought it was risky to take you seriously . ”
81213	81266	81109	81110	the Professor	4071	“ No , no , I am delighted . The world at the threshold of one 's five senses . One has but to look and to listen and the beauty of things displays itself for our benefit . Yes , but that is what the artists say , not the Professors . ”
81267	81274	81276	81276	Theobald	181	“ Even a Professor is human , ”
81340	81348	81350	81351	Lady Engleton	176	“ I quarrel with you about art , ”
81353	81374	81350	81351	Lady Engleton	176	“ Art is art , and nature is nature , both charming in their way , though I prefer art . ”
81375	81380	81382	81383	the Professor	4071	“ Our old quarrel ! ”
81385	81422	81382	81383	the Professor	4071	“ Because a wild glade is beautiful in its quality of wild glade , you ca n't see the beauty in a trim bit of garden , with its delightful suggestion of human thought and care . ”
81423	81429	81431	81432	Professor Theobald	181	“ I object to stiffness , ”
81451	81465	81448	81449	Lady Engleton	176	“ fatuous wriggles to all the walks , for mere wrigglings ' sake , ”
81505	81532	81487	81488	Lady Engleton	176	“ And yet you appreciate so keenly my old enamels , and your eye seeks out , in a minute , a picturesque roof or gable . ”
81533	81548	81550	81551	his colleague	1971	“ Perhaps Theobald leans to the picturesque and does not care for the classic , ”
81553	81561	81550	81551	his colleague	1971	“ a fundamental distinction in mental bias . ”
81562	81591	81592	81593	Lady Engleton	176	“ Then why does he enjoy so much of the Renaissance work on caskets and goblets ? He was raving about them last night in the choicest English . ”
81804	81808	81846	81850	a master of the ambiguous	1976	“ second class , ”
82475	82478	82479	82479	he	116	“ Fortescue , ”
82483	82514	82479	82479	he	116	“ I envy you your champion . You point , Mrs. Temperley , to lofty altitudes . I , as a mere man , can not pretend to scale them . ”
82527	82556	82516	82516	he	116	“ In this world , where there are so many other evils to combat , one feels that it is more rational to attack the more important first . ”
82557	82572	82574	82575	Professor Fortescue	116	“ Ah ! there is nothing like an evil to bolster up an evil , ”
82577	82710	82574	82575	Professor Fortescue	116	“ the argument never fails . Every abuse may find shelter behind it . The slave trade , for instance ; have we not white slavery in our midst ? How inconsistent to trouble about negroes till our own people are truly free ! Wife - beating ? Sad ; but then children are often shamefully ill - used . Wait till they are fully protected before fussing about wives . Protect children ? Foolish knight - errant , when you ought to know that drunkenness is at the root of these crimes ! Sweep away this curse , before thinking of the children . As for animals , how can any rational person consider their sufferings , when there are men , women , and children with wrongs to be redressed ? ”
82715	82733	82711	82712	Professor Theobald	181	“ My dear Fortescue , I knew you would have some ingenious excuse for your amiable weaknesses . ”
82734	82746	82748	82749	the Professor	4071	“ It is easier to find epithets than answers , Theobald , ”
82754	82781	82748	82749	the Professor	4071	“ I confess I wonder at a man of your logical power being taken in with this cheap argument , if argument it can be called . ”
82782	82796	82798	82798	Theobald	181	“ It is my attachment to logic that makes me crave for consistency , ”
82815	82838	82809	82810	Professor Fortescue	116	“ But do you really mean to tell me that you think it logical to excuse one abuse by pointing to another ? ”
82839	82861	82863	82863	Theobald	181	“ I think that while there are ill - used women and children , it is certainly inconsistent to consider animals , ”
82865	82902	82904	82905	Professor Fortescue	116	“ It does not occur to you that the spirit in man that permits abuse of power over animals is precisely the same devil - inspired spirit that expresses itself in cruelty towards children . Ah , ”
82911	82977	82908	82908	his	116	“ then you really are one of the many who help wrong to breed wrong , and suffering to foster suffering , all the world over . It is you and those who reason as you reason , who give to our miseries their terrible vitality . What arguments has evil ever given to evil ! What shelter and succour cruelty offers eternally to cruelty ! ”
82991	82992	82989	82989	Fortescue	116	” “
83051	83052	83053	83053	You	116	” “
83060	83064	83053	83053	You	116	” exclaimed Theobald . “
83095	83096	83087	83088	Mrs. Temperley	154	” “
83136	83143	83125	83127	any consistent person	2001	” Hadria returned . Theobald laughed . “
83162	83163	83145	83145	I	0	” “
83214	83215	83216	83216	You	181	” “
83220	83256	83216	83216	You	181	” he exclaimed . Mrs. Temperley 's manner stiffened . Acute as the Professor was in many directions , he did not appear to notice the change . His own manner was not above criticism . “
83261	83274	83216	83216	You	181	” said Lady Engleton , in speaking of him afterwards to Hadria , “
83331	83360	83319	83321	the good man	1126	” The only means of procuring the indispensable afternoon tea was to go on to the Red House , which Mrs. Temperley proposed that they should all do . “
83375	83398	83399	83399	I	0	” Lady Engleton asked as they descended the steps . The Professor 's quick glance sought Mrs. Temperley 's before he answered . “
83408	83409	83399	83399	I	0	” “
83425	83798	83420	83421	a neighbour	2008	” HADRIA tried to avoid Professor Theobald , but he was not easily avoided . She frequently met him in her walks . The return of spring had tempted her to resume her old habit of rising with the sun . But she found , what she had feared , that her strength had departed , and she as fatigued instead of invigorated , as of yore . She did not regard this loss in a resigned spirit . Resignation was certainly not her strong point . The vicar 's wife and the doctor 's wife and the rest of the neighbours compared their woes and weariness over five o'clock tea , and these appeared so many and so severe that Hadria felt half ashamed to count hers at all . Yet why lower the altars of the sane goddess because her shrine was deserted ? Health was health , though all the women of England were confirmed invalids . And with nothing less ought reasonable creatures to be satisfied . As for taking enfeeblement as a natural dispensation , she would as soon regard delirium tremens in that light . She chafed fiercely against the loss of that blessed sense of well - being and overflowing health , that she used to have , in the old days . She resented the nerve - weariness , the fatigue that she was now more conscious of than ever , with the coming of the spring . The impulse of creative energy broke forth in her . The pearly mornings and the birds ' songs stirred every instinct of expression . The outburst did not receive its usual check . The influences of disenchantment were counteracted by Professor Fortescue 's presence . His sympathy was marvellous in its penetration , brimming the cold hollows of her spirit , as a flooded river fills the tiniest chinks and corners about its arid banks . He called forth all her natural buoyancy and her exulting sense of life , which was precisely the element which charged her sadness with such a fierce electric quality , when she became possessed by it , as a cloud by storm . Valeria too was roused by the season . “
83849	83931	83822	83825	a messenger - angel	2010	” If Hadria met Professor Theobald in her rambles , she always cut short her intended walk . She and Valeria with Professor Fortescue wandered together , far and wide . They watched the daily budding greenery , the gleams of daffodils among their sword - blades of leaves , the pushing of sheaths and heads through the teeming soil , the bursts of sunshine and the absurd childish little gushes of rain , skimming the green country like a frown . “
83940	83941	83822	83825	a messenger - angel	2010	” “
83945	83959	83822	83825	a messenger - angel	2010	” said Hadria , when Professor Theobald thus grew enthusiastic on the subject , “
83972	84120	83962	83963	my cook	2014	” She would not second his mood , be it what it might . Each day , as they passed along the lanes , the pale green had spread , like fire , on the hedges , caught the chestnuts , with their fat buds shining in the sun , which already was releasing the close - packed leaflets . Hadria ( apparently out of sheer devilry , said Professor Theobald ) kept up a running commentary on the season , and on her hapless position , bound to be off on the chase for a cook at this moment of festival . Nor was this all . Crockery , pots and pans , clothes for the children , clothes for herself , were urgently needed , and no experienced person , she declared , could afford to regard the matter as simple because it was trivial . “
84133	84149	83962	83963	my cook	2014	” Valeria thought that cooks had simply to be advertised for , and they came . “
84153	84157	84158	84158	Helen	197	” exclaimed Hadria . “
84210	84211	84212	84212	You	2021	” “
84228	84232	84217	84217	women	606	” said Valeria . “
84268	84301	84264	84264	Helen	197	” It frequently happened that Hadria and Miss Du Prel came across Lady Engleton and her guests , in the Priory garden . From being accidental , the meetings had become intentional . “
84331	84619	84311	84311	Boccaccio	203	” cried Miss Du Prel . They all kindled at the idea . Valeria made some fanciful laws that she said were to govern the little realm . Everyone might express himself freely , and all that he said would be held as sacred , as if it were in confidence . To speak ill or slightingly of anyone , was forbidden . All local and practical topics were to be dropped , as soon as the moss - grown griffins who guarded the Garden of Forgetfulness were passed . Hadria was incorrigibly flippant about the banishment of important local subjects . She said that the kitchen - boiler was out of order , and yet she had to take part in these highly - cultivated conversations and smile , as she complained , with that kitchen - boiler gnawing at her vitals . She claimed to be set on a level with the Spartan boy , if not above him . Valeria might scoff , as those proverbially did who never felt a wound . Hadria found a certain lack of tender feeling among the happy few who had no such tragic burdens to sustain . Not only were these prosaic subjects banished from within the cincture of the gentle griffins , but also the suspicions , spites , petty jealousies , vulgar curiosities , and all the indefinable little darts and daggers that fly in the social air , destroying human sympathy and good - will . Each mind could expand freely , no longer on the defensive against the rain of small stabs . There grew up a delicate , and chivalrous code among the little group who met within the griffins ' territory . “
84639	84644	84311	84311	Boccaccio	203	” said Professor Theobald , “
84659	84706	84646	84646	I	0	” Professor Fortescue observed that whatever might be said about their own little band , it was a strange fact that bodies of human beings were able to produce , by union , a condition far above or far below the average of their separate values . “
84717	84819	84646	84646	I	0	” he said . These meetings stood out as a unique experience in the memory of all who took part in them . Chance had brought them to pass , and they refused to answer to the call of a less learned magician . Lady Engleton and Mrs. Temperley alternately sent tea and fruit to the terrace , on the days of meeting , and there the little company would spend the afternoon serenely , surrounded by the beauties of the garden with its enticing avenues , its chaunting birds , its flushes of bloom , and its rich delicious scents . “
84836	84840	84822	84822	we	2027	” cried Valeria . “
84891	84892	84893	84893	We	2027	” “
84914	84919	84911	84912	Mrs. Temperley	154	” said Professor Theobald . “
84925	84930	84911	84912	Mrs. Temperley	154	” murmured Professor Fortescue , “
84938	84939	84940	84940	I	0	” “
84953	84957	84940	84940	I	0	” cried Valeria ; “
84997	84998	84999	84999	One	329	” “
85013	85018	84999	84999	One	329	” said Professor Fortescue . “
85077	85078	85083	85083	you	0	” “
85089	85094	85083	85083	you	0	” cried Lady Engleton . “
85105	85106	85097	85097	I	0	” “
85128	85132	85110	85110	you	0	” Valeria suggested . “
85157	85158	85142	85142	I	0	” “
85170	85186	85161	85161	you	0	” asked Lady Engleton , with a somewhat ingratiating upward gaze of her blue eyes . “
85223	85318	85161	85161	you	0	” The atmosphere of Griffin - land , as Professor Theobald called it , while becoming to his character , made him a little recklessly frank at times . He admitted that throughout his varied experience of life , he had found flattery the most powerful weapon in a skilled hand , and that he had never known it fail . He related instances of the signal success which had followed its application with the trowel . He reminded his listeners of Lord Beaconsfield 's famous saying , and chuckled over the unfortunate woman , “
85326	85341	85161	85161	you	0	” who had become his benefactress , in consequence of a discreet allusion to the “
85345	85353	85354	85355	The woman	4547	” and a well - placed sigh . “
85362	85367	85372	85372	she	4547	” said Joseph Fleming . “
85402	85412	85387	85387	she	4547	” Professor Theobald laughed mightily at his own sarcasm . “
85490	85534	85487	85488	Mrs. Temperley	154	” Mrs. Temperley supposed that clever women had something of human nature in them , and valued overmuch what they did not possess . Professor Theobald had perhaps looked for an answer that would have betrayed more of the speaker 's secret feelings . “
85543	85547	85540	85540	I	0	” he said , “
85700	85771	85775	85775	I	0	” Professor Fortescue observed that the clergy , at times , developed qualities called feminine , because in some respects their conditions resembled those of women . Theobald assented enthusiastically to this view . He had himself entered the church as a young fellow ( let not Mrs. Temperley look so inconsiderately astonished ) , and had left it on account of being unable to conscientiously subscribe to its tenets . “
85929	85933	85882	85882	mine	0	” Hadria coloured . “
85951	85955	85882	85882	mine	0	” added Theobald , “
85973	85974	85882	85882	mine	0	” “
85977	85981	85882	85882	mine	0	” exclaimed Hadria , “
85996	85997	85983	85983	you	0	” “
86085	86162	86240	86240	I	0	” Joseph Fleming caused a sort of anti - climax by mentioning simply that he did n't know that any nitrogen was required in the atmosphere . One always heard about the oxygen . Professor Theobald remarked , with a chuckle , that this was one of the uses of polite conversation ; one picked up information by the way - side . Joseph agreed that it was wonderfully instructive , if the speakers were intelligent . “
86166	86178	86240	86240	I	0	” said the Professor , tapping Joseph familiarly on the shoulder . “
86187	86199	86240	86240	I	0	” enquired Lady Engleton , when the moment came for parting . “
86205	86209	86240	86240	I	0	” said Valeria . “
86238	86239	86228	86228	I	0	” “
86251	86261	86240	86240	I	0	” announced Theobald , with a glance at Hadria . “
86265	86270	86263	86263	I	0	” said Lady Engleton . “
86278	86279	86280	86280	I	0	” “
86282	86286	86280	86280	I	0	” Hadria observed , “
86293	86431	86280	86280	I	0	” Professor Theobald 's jaw shut with a snap , and he turned and left the group almost rudely . HADRIA thought that Professor Theobald had not spoken at random , when he said that the sweetest tribute a woman can receive is that paid to her personal charm . This unwilling admission was dragged out of her by the sight of Valeria Du Prel , as the central figure of an admiring group , in the large drawing - room at Craddock Place . She was looking handsome and animated , her white hair drawn proudly off her brow , and placed as if with intention beside the silken curtains , whose tint of misty pale green was so becoming to her beauty . Valeria was holding her little court , and thoroughly enjoying the admiration . “
86471	86758	86453	86453	himself	181	” Hadria said to herself , resentfully . Professor Theobald was bending over Miss Du Prel with an air of devotion . Hadria wished that she would not take his compliments so smilingly . Valeria would not be proof against his flattery . She kindled with a child 's frankness at praise . It stung Hadria to think of her friend being carelessly classed by the Professor among women whose weakness he understood and could play upon . He would imagine that he had discovered the mystery of the sun , because he had observed a spot upon it , not understanding the nature of the very spot . Granted that a little salve to one 's battered and scarified self - love was soft and grateful , what did that prove of the woman who welcomed it , beyond a human craving to keep the inner picture of herself as bright and fine as might be ? The man who , out of contempt or irreverence , set a bait for the universal appetite proved himself , rather than his intended victim , of meagre quality . Valeria complimented him generously by supposing him sincere . Occasional bursts of laughter came from her court . Professor Theobald looked furtively round , as if seeking some one , or watching the effect of his conduct on Mrs. Temperley . Could he be trying to make her jealous of Valeria ? Hadria gave a sudden little laugh while Lord Engleton — a shy , rather taciturn man — was shewing her his wife 's last picture . Hadria had to explain the apparent discourtesy as best she could . The picture was of English meadows at sunset . “
86769	86774	86453	86453	himself	181	” said Lord Engleton . “
86797	86798	86790	86790	you	2069	” “
86802	86815	86790	86790	you	2069	” she answered , with the instinct of extravagance that annoyed Hubert , “
86824	86838	86816	86816	I	0	” Lord Engleton brought a portfolio full of sketches for her to see . “
86845	87016	87017	87017	He	2071	” As Hadria laid down the last sketch , her eyes wandered round the softly - lighted , dimly beautiful room , and suddenly she was seized with a swift , reasonless , overpowering sense of happiness that she felt to be atmospheric and parenthetical in character , but all the more keen for that reason , while it lasted . The second black inexorable semicircle was ready to enclose the little moment , but its contents had the condensed character of that which stands within limits , and reminded her , with a little sting , as of spur to horse , of her sharp , terrible aptitude for delight and her hunger for it . Why not , why not ? What pinched , ungenerous philosophy was it that insisted on voluntary starvation ? One saw its offspring in the troops of thin white souls that hurry , like ghosts , down the avenues of Life . Again Professor Theobald 's stealthy glance was directed towards Mrs. Temperley . “
87032	87038	87017	87017	He	2071	” she said to herself . “
87048	87208	87045	87046	the group	941	” suggested Lord Engleton . It opened to admit the new comers , disclosing Miss Du Prel , in a gown of pale amber brocade , enthroned upon a straight - backed antique sofa . The exquisiteness of the surroundings which Lady Engleton had a peculiar gift in arranging , the mellow candlelight , the flowers and colours , seem to have satisfied in Valeria an inborn love of splendour that often opened hungry and unsatisfied jaws . She had never looked so brilliant or so handsome . Professor Theobald 's face cleared . He explained to Mrs. Temperley that they had been discussing the complexity of human character , and had come to the conclusion that it was impossible to really understand even the simplest man or woman alive . Professor Theobald said that it was a dispensation of Providence which intended the human race for social life . Lady Engleton upbraided the author of the cynical utterance . “
87221	87226	87045	87046	the group	941	” the culprit demanded . “
87258	87259	87236	87236	I	0	” “
87274	87287	87288	87288	one	329	” cried Miss Du Prel , flinging up her fine head defiantly ; “
87357	87376	87393	87393	you	2081	” Hadria , in justice , could not refuse to acknowledge that Professor Theobald was open - minded . “
87379	87383	87393	87393	you	2081	” he said , “
87401	87402	87403	87403	You	2081	” “
87409	87414	87403	87403	You	2081	” said Professor Fortescue . “
87422	87493	87403	87403	You	2081	” added Hadria . Both Professors looked at her , each with an expression of enquiry . It was difficult to understand from exactly what sources of experience or intuition the singular remark could have sprung . The conversation took a slight swerve . Professor Theobald contended that all our fond distinctions of vice and virtue , right and wrong , were mere praise and blame of conditions and events . “
87530	87629	87630	87632	The sublime creature	2085	” This view offended Miss Du Prel . Joseph Fleming and Lord Engleton rallied round her . Hubert Temperley joined them . Man , the sublime , the summit of the creation , the end and object of the long and painful processes of nature ; sin - spotted perhaps , weak and stumbling , but still the masterpiece of the centuries — was this great and mysterious creature to be thought of irreverently as a mere plain surface for paint ? Only consider it ! Professor Theobald 's head went down between his shoulders as he laughed . “
87642	87643	87644	87644	He	2084	” “
87666	87671	87661	87661	he	181	” said Professor Fortescue . “
87682	87687	87661	87661	he	181	” asserted Miss Du Prel “
87694	87695	87710	87710	I	0	” “
87698	87703	87710	87710	I	0	” cried Professor Theobald . “

87721	87722	87710	87710	I	0	” “
87731	87736	87710	87710	I	0	” added Professor Fortescue , “
87832	87833	87840	87840	he	116	” “
87847	87851	87840	87840	he	116	” said Temperley . “
87862	87868	87840	87840	he	116	” Lady Engleton reassured him . “
87881	87890	87874	87874	you	0	” he asked , with a courtly bow . “
87905	87906	87907	87907	I	0	” “
87917	87922	87907	87907	I	0	” cried Professor Fortescue . “
87925	87929	87907	87907	I	0	” said Theobald . “
87944	87945	87947	87947	he	332	” “
87957	87961	87947	87947	he	332	” Hadria demanded . “
87968	87973	87947	87947	he	332	” said Professor Fortescue . “
87996	87997	87998	87998	You	0	” “
88010	88017	88018	88018	I	0	” Professor Fortescue asserted , fantastically . “
88044	88049	88050	88050	I	0	” cried Lady Engleton . “
88067	88075	88050	88050	I	0	” said Theobald , with a chuckle . “
88083	88087	88079	88079	its	2100	” observed Hadria . “
88095	88132	88079	88079	its	2100	” cried Miss Du Prel . The chime of a clock startled them with its accusation of lingering too long . The hostess remonstrated at the breaking up the party . Why should they hurry away ? “
88153	88157	88150	88151	Lady Engleton	176	” said Hubert , “
88172	88180	88165	88165	you	176	” Professor Theobald went to the window . “
88205	88263	88264	88264	I	0	” The idea was eagerly adopted , and the whole party sallied forth together into the brilliant night . Long black shadows of their forms stalked on before them , as if , said Valeria , they were messengers from Hades come to conduct each his victim to the abode of the shades . Professor Theobald shuddered . “
88307	88384	88301	88301	you	176	” She made some intentionally trite answer . Professor Theobald 's quick eyes discovered a glow - worm , and he shouted to the ladies to come and see the little green lantern of the spring . The mysterious light was bright enough to irradiate the blades of grass around it , and even to cast a wizard - like gleam on the strange face of the Professor as he bent down close to the ground . “
88392	88397	88301	88301	you	176	” cried Lady Engleton . “
88415	88419	88420	88421	Some one	3818	” commented Hadria . “
88446	88451	88435	88435	she	3818	” said Professor Theobald . “
88475	88518	88455	88456	Mr. Fleming	159	” The Professor resigned his place to him . When Joseph rose from his somewhat indifferent survey of the insect , Professor Theobald had established himself at Mrs. Temperley 's right hand , and the rest of the party were left behind . “
88524	88529	88455	88456	Mr. Fleming	159	” said the Professor , “
88597	88598	88599	88599	I	0	” “
88604	88605	88601	88601	your	159	” “

88660	88729	88657	88657	I	0	” Hadria , dropping the subject , enquired whether the Professor was well acquainted with this part of the country . He knew it by heart . A charming country ; warm , luxuriant , picturesque , the pick of England to his mind . What could beat its woodlands , its hills , its relics of the old world , its barns and churches and smiling villages ? “
88741	88769	88657	88657	I	0	” Hadria could not resist asking . Tudor mansions ? There was no cottage so humble , provided it were picturesque , that did not charm him . “
88772	88782	88657	88657	I	0	” exclaimed Hadria , with a faintly emphasized surprise . “
88793	88794	88784	88784	I	0	” “
88803	88811	88812	88813	Mrs. Temperley	154	” The Professor 's mouth shut sharply . “
88830	88831	88812	88813	Mrs. Temperley	154	” “
88840	88868	88812	88813	Mrs. Temperley	154	” The sound of their steps on the broad avenue smote sharply on their ears . Their absurd - looking shadows stretched always in front of them . “
88873	88882	88812	88813	Mrs. Temperley	154	” Hadria observed , to break the silence . “
88885	88896	88812	88813	Mrs. Temperley	154	” returned her companion , as if waking from thought . “
88909	88910	88911	88911	I	0	” “
88946	88947	88948	88948	You	2118	” “

89065	89073	89133	89133	you	2118	” said Hadria . Professor Theobald grinned . “
89087	89096	89074	89074	You	2118	” Why in heaven 's name should she ? “
89104	89114	89074	89074	You	2118	” Professor Theobald continued , reading her silence aright , “
89155	89156	89152	89152	I	0	” “
89185	89186	89187	89187	You	2118	” “

89272	89273	89326	89327	Lady Engleton	176	” “
89296	89303	89304	89304	I	0	” Hadria gave a little laugh . “
89324	89325	89317	89318	Lady Engleton	176	” “
89333	89334	89335	89335	I	0	” “

89371	89375	89362	89362	you	2118	” said Hadria , “
89382	89388	89389	89389	I	0	” The Professor laughed delightedly . “
89432	89433	89430	89430	herself	154	” “
89461	89471	89446	89447	Mrs. Temperley	154	” The big jaw closed , with a snap . “
89488	89497	89502	89502	you	2118	” he said , after a considerable pause ; “
89507	89514	89515	89515	I	0	” Mrs. Temperley made no comment . “
89524	89532	89517	89517	I	0	” he said , with a sigh . “
89569	89570	89571	89571	I	0	” “
89577	89592	89571	89571	I	0	” said the Professor , as he opened the gate of the Red House , “
89597	89598	89599	89601	A SINGULAR character	2137	” “
89603	89608	89599	89601	A SINGULAR character	2137	” said Professor Theobald . “
89618	89695	89616	89616	her	2138	” Lady Engleton asserted . Lord Engleton observed that people were always speaking ill of Mrs. Temperley , but he never could see that she was worse than her neighbours . She was cleverer ; that might be her offence . Madame Bertaux observed in her short , decisive way that Craddock Dene might have settled down with Mrs. Temperley peaceably enough , if it had n't been for her action about the schoolmistress 's child . “
89703	89708	89701	89701	everybody	3781	” said Lady Engleton . “
89714	89724	89701	89701	everybody	3781	” asked Theobald , turning slowly towards his hostess . “
89748	89755	89740	89740	You	2140	” Lady Engleton related the incident . “
89812	89820	89802	89802	you	2140	” The Professor remembered the occasion perfectly . “
89925	90029	89896	89897	Mrs. Walker	162	” Madame Bertaux snorted significantly . Lady Engleton had remarked a strange , sad look in Ellen Jervis 's eyes , and owned to having done her best to circumvent the respected pastor and his wife , by lending her books occasionally , and encouraging her to think her own thoughts , and get what happiness she could out of her communings with larger spirits than she was likely to find in Craddock . Of course Mrs. Walker now gave Lady Engleton to understand that she was partly responsible for the poor woman 's misfortune . She attributed it to Ellen 's having had “
90038	90039	90040	90040	I	0	” “
90069	90089	89896	89897	Mrs. Walker	162	” Professor Theobald chuckled . He enquired if Lady Engleton knew Mrs. Temperley 's motive in adopting the child . “
90148	90217	90131	90131	She	211	” Some weeks had now passed since the arrival of the two Professors . The meetings in the Priory garden had been frequent . They had affected for the better Professor Theobald 's manner . Valeria 's laws had curbed the worst side of him , or prevented it from shewing itself so freely . He felt the atmosphere of the little society , and acknowledged that it was “
90223	90252	90253	90253	My	0	” As for his intellect it took to blazing , as if , he said , without false modesty , a torch had been placed in pure oxygen . “
90284	90498	90131	90131	She	211	” The little feud between him and Mrs. Temperley had been patched up . She felt that she had been rude to him , on one occasion at any rate , and desired to make amends . He had become more cautious in his conduct towards her . During this period of the Renaissance , as Hadria afterwards called the short - lived epoch , little Martha was visited frequently . Her protectress had expected to have to do battle with hereditary weakness on account of her mother 's sufferings , but the child shewed no signs of this . Either the common belief that mental trouble in the mother is reflected in the child , was unfounded , or the evil could be overcome by the simple beneficence of pure air , good food , and warm clothing . Hadria had begun to feel a more personal interest in her charge . She had taken it under her care of her own choice , without the pressure of any social law or sentiment , and in these circumstances of freedom , its helplessness appealed to her protective instincts . She felt the relationship to be a true one , in contradistinction to the more usual form of protectorate of woman to child . “
90516	90520	90628	90628	yourself	2155	” she asserted , “
90539	90597	90598	90598	You	2155	” She was issuing from little Martha 's cottage on one splendid morning , when she saw Professor Theobald coming up the road from Craddock Dene . He caught sight of Hadria , hesitated , coloured , glanced furtively up the road , and then , seeing he was observed , came forward , raising his cap . “
90648	90649	90650	90650	I	0	” “
90659	90736	90650	90650	I	0	” said Hadria . She was waving a twig of lavender , and little Martha was making grabs at it , and laughing her gurgling laugh of babyish glee . Professor Theobald stood in the road facing up hill towards Craddock , whose church tower was visible from here , just peeping through the spring foliage of the vicarage garden . He only now and again looked round at the picture that he professed to admire . “
90757	90816	90820	90820	you	2155	” He hesitated , and a wave of dark colour flooded his face up to the roots of his close - clipped hair . He paused a moment , and then bent down to open the little gate . His stalwart figure , in the diminutive enclosure , reduced it to the appearance of a doll 's garden . “
90827	91098	90820	90820	you	2155	” Hadria advised . The rosy - cheeked nurse looked with proud expectancy at the face of the strange gentleman , to note the admiration that he could not but feel . His lips were set . The Professor evidently knew his duty and proceeded to admire with due energy . Little Martha shrank away a little from the bearded face , and her lower lip worked threateningly , but the perilous moment was staved over by means of the Professor 's watch , hastily claimed by Hannah , who dispensed with ceremony in the emergency . Martha 's eyes opened wide , and the little hands came out to grasp the treasure . Hadria stood and laughed at the sight of the gigantic Professor , helplessly tethered by his own chain to the imperious baby , in whose fingers the watch was tightly clasped . The child was in high delight at the loquacious new toy — so superior to foolish fluffy rabbits that could not tick to save their skins . Martha had no notion of relinquishing her hold , so they need not tug in that feeble way ; if they pulled too hard , she would yell ! She evidently meant business , said her captive . So long as they left her the watch , they might do as they pleased ; she was perfectly indifferent to the accidental human accompaniments of the new treasure , but on that one point she was firm . She proceeded to stuff the watch into her mouth as far as it would go . The Professor was dismayed . “
91104	91109	91110	91110	You	2162	” Hadria reassured him . “
91117	91118	91110	91110	You	2162	” “
91135	91140	91120	91120	you	2162	” enquired the prisoner . “
91151	91152	91141	91141	I	0	” “
91176	91177	91166	91166	her	2164	” “
91189	91204	91180	91180	I	0	” said Hadria maliciously . The Professor groaned , and struggled in the toils . “
91224	91251	91219	91219	we	2166	” Martha kept her features ready for that purpose at a moment 's notice , should any nonsense be attempted . The victim looked round miserably . “
91265	91273	91274	91274	You	2162	” Hadria shook her head and laughed . “
91285	91289	91274	91274	You	2162	” she said : “
91294	91295	91298	91300	you little tyrant	2168	” “
91302	91345	91298	91300	you little tyrant	2168	” exclaimed the Professor , shaking his fist in the baby 's face , at which she laughed a taunting and triumphant laugh . Then , once more , the object of dispute went into her mouth . Martha gurgled with joy . “
91352	91358	91361	91361	She	2169	” cried her victim helplessly . “
91372	91373	91374	91375	Little imp	2170	” “

91706	91710	91704	91704	hers	2169	” said Hadria . “
91732	91778	91779	91779	She	2169	” Martha frowned and fretted . She even looked shocked , according to Hadria , who stood by laughing . The baby , she pointed out , failed to understand how her captive could so far forget himself as to desire to regain his liberty . “
91792	91793	91779	91779	She	2169	” “
91796	91800	91779	91779	She	2169	” he exclaimed . “
91806	91911	91779	91779	She	2169	” she assented . The Professor laughed , and said he was tired of being a Type . At length a little gentle force had to be used , in spite of furious resentment on the part of the baby . A more injured and ill - treated mortal could not have been imagined . She set up a heaven - piercing wail , evidently overcome with indignation and surprise at the cruel treatment that she had received . What horrid selfishness to take oneself and one 's property away , when an engaging innocent enjoys grasping it and stuffing it into its mouth ! “
91920	91937	91916	91918	a guilty monster	2181	” Hadria enquired , as the lament of the offended infant followed them up the road . “
91950	91955	91956	91956	I	0	” he exclaimed ruefully . “
91973	91981	91982	91982	You	2180	” He paused irresolutely . Hadria laughed . “
91989	91993	91982	91982	You	2180	” she exclaimed . “

92030	92043	92020	92022	that wretched child	2184	” cried the allegory , with the air of a repentant criminal . “
92055	92059	92020	92022	that wretched child	2184	” exclaimed Hadria . “
92171	92203	92153	92153	she	2188	” Professor Theobald seemed too much concerned about the child , who was still wailing , to pay much attention to any other topic . He turned to retrace his steps . “
92211	92215	92206	92206	you	2180	” said Hadria . “
92291	92292	92293	92293	I	0	” “
92302	92315	92316	92316	She	2188	” Hadria stopped in the road to laugh at the perturbed Professor . “
92403	92421	92422	92424	The near relation	2196	” The Professor stumbled over a stone in the road , and looked back at it vindictively . “
92456	92457	92442	92442	he	2196	” “

92616	92652	92594	92595	the pilgrim	2205	” said the Professor . When they arrived at the cottage the wails were dying away , and Hadria advised that they should leave well alone . So the baby 's victim somewhat reluctantly retired . “
92671	92675	92666	92666	one	329	” he observed . “
92687	92736	92737	92737	She	2208	” said Hadria . The walk was pursued towards Craddock . Hadria said she had to ask Dodge , the old gravedigger , if he could give a few days ' work in the garden at the Red House . The Professor was walking for walking 's sake . “
92747	92751	92745	92745	she	2208	” said Hadria . “
92767	92768	92764	92764	her	2208	” “

92898	92903	92895	92896	Mrs. Temperley	154	” murmured the Professor . “

93052	93080	93033	93033	He	2223	” repeated Hadria vaguely . Mrs. Gullick looked at her as at one whose claims to complete possession of the faculties there seems sad reason to doubt . “
93093	93094	93033	93033	He	2223	” “
93105	93110	93112	93112	me	0	” cried Mrs. Gullick . “
93125	93193	93117	93117	I	0	” People were all standing at their doors , and the children had gathered at the gate of the church , with hands full of flowers . The wedding party was , it appeared , to arrive almost immediately . The children set up a shout as the first carriage was heard coming up the hill . The bride appeared to be a popular character in Craddock . “
93224	93261	93212	93212	she	2232	” The Professor asked his companion if she remarked that the amiable lady was spoken of universally in the past tense , as some one who had passed from the light of day . Hadria laughed . “
93279	93310	93269	93269	I	0	” Dodge was found resting on a broom - handle , with a flower in his button - hole . Marion Jordan had supplied him with port wine when he was “
93313	93409	93269	93269	I	0	” in the winter . Dodge found it of excellent quality . He approved of the institution of landed property , and had a genuine regard for the fair - haired , sweet - voiced girl who used to come in her pony - cart to distribute her bounty to the villagers . Her class in the Sunday - school , as he remarked , was always the best behaved . The new schoolmistress , a sour and uncompromising looking person , had issued from her cottage in her Sunday best to see the ceremony . “
93421	93425	93413	93414	little Martha	129	” said Hadria , “

93472	93534	93535	93535	They	2238	” announced a chorus of children 's voices , as the first carriage drove up . The excitement was breathless . The occupants alighted and made their way to the church . After that , the carriages came in fairly quick succession . The bridegroom was criticised freely by the crowd . They did not think him worthy of his bride . “
93546	93550	93535	93535	They	2238	” Dodge observed , “
93571	93572	93535	93535	They	2238	” “
93588	93600	93575	93575	I	0	” Mrs. Gullick observed , sympathizing with the bride 's feeling . “
93618	93619	93620	93620	She	2239	” “
93636	93641	93631	93631	she	2239	” another woman remarked . “
93654	93661	93668	93668	they	2238	” a romantic young woman enquired . “
93671	93676	93668	93668	they	2238	” said Dodge judicially ; “
93694	93695	93696	93696	You	2243	” “
93710	93715	93708	93708	you	2243	” prompted Mrs. Gullick . “
93739	93761	93736	93737	Mr. Fleming	159	” The murmur of interest at this announcement was drowned by the sound of carriage wheels . The bride had come . “
93779	93915	93918	93918	she	219	” exclaimed Hadria . A fair , faint , admirably gentle creature , floating in a mist of tulle , was wafted out of the brougham , the spring sunshine burnishing the pale hair , and flashing a dazzling sword - like glance on the string of diamonds at her throat . It seemed too emphatic , too keen a greeting for the faint ambiguous being , about to put the teaching of her girlhood , and her pretty hopes and faiths , to the test . She gave a start and shiver as she stepped out into the brilliant day , turning with a half - scared look to the crowd of faces . It seemed almost as if she were seeking help in a blind , bewildered fashion . Hadria had an impulse . “
93933	93989	93918	93918	she	219	” Professor Theobald shook his head . Within the church , the procession moved up the aisle , to the sound of the organ . Hadria compared the whole ceremony to some savage rite of sacrifice : priest and people with the victim , chosen for her fairness , decked as is meet for victims . “
93996	94016	93918	93918	she	219	” Lady Engleton suggested when the ceremony was over , and the organ was pealing out the wedding march . “
94059	94060	94061	94062	The bride	5491	” “
94076	94106	94061	94062	The bride	5491	” Lady Engleton admitted , with a laugh that grated on Hadria . Professor Theobald had fallen behind with Joseph Fleming , who had turned up among the crowd . “
94116	94117	94061	94062	The bride	5491	” “
94121	94133	94134	94134	I	0	” said Hadria . Lady Engleton seemed to have expected dissent . “
94137	94141	94134	94134	I	0	” she said , “
94164	94165	94153	94153	Women	606	” “
94178	94179	94153	94153	Women	606	” “
94185	94186	94182	94183	my dear	3722	” “
94218	94244	94290	94290	your	3722	” Lady Engleton laughed and said something to lead her companion on . She liked to listen to Mrs. Temperley when she was thoroughly roused . “
94287	94288	94290	94290	your	3722	” “
94295	94303	94290	94290	your	3722	” observed Lady Engleton , much amused . “
94387	94388	94389	94389	They	2256	” “
94393	94398	94389	94389	They	2256	” said Lady Engleton . “
94402	94416	94417	94417	They	2256	” Hadria vindictively flicked off the head of a dandelion with her parasol . “
94545	94546	94512	94512	their	2256	” “
94557	94562	94512	94512	their	2256	” Lady Engleton admitted . “
94617	94622	94609	94609	people	3687	” Lady Engleton laughed . “
94676	94677	94672	94672	you	2263	” “
94689	94693	94685	94685	I	0	” said Hadria . “
94706	94720	94694	94694	I	0	” But you misrepresent it — there are modifying facts in the case . ”
94721	94802	94812	94812	she	176	“ I do n't see them . Girls are told : ‘ So and so is not a nice thing for you to talk about . Wait , however , until the proper signal is given , and then woe betide you if you do n't cheerfully accept it as your bounden duty . ’ If that does not enjoin abject slavishness and deliberate immorality of the most cold - blooded kind , I simply do n't know what does . ”
94822	94842	94812	94812	she	176	“ How we ever came to have tied ourselves into such an extraordinary mental knot is what bewilders me , ”
94846	94881	94843	94843	Hadria	211	“ and still more , why it is that we all , by common consent , go on acting and talking as if the tangled skein ran smooth and straight through one 's fingers . ”
94882	94894	94896	94897	Lady Engleton	176	“ Chiefly , perhaps , because women wo n't speak out , ”
94899	94906	94908	94908	Hadria	211	“ They have been so drilled , ”
94910	94926	94908	94908	Hadria	211	“ so gagged , so deafened , by ‘ the shrieks of near relations . ’ ”
94953	94959	94960	94960	Hadria	211	“ Tom - boy bells , ”
95010	95021	95023	95023	Hadria	211	“ Evidently without the least notion what they are celebrating , ”
95083	95095	95097	95098	Lady Engleton	176	“ I am afraid she was in love with Joseph Fleming , ”
95100	95133	95097	95098	Lady Engleton	176	“ I hoped at one time that he cared for her , but that Irish friend of Marion 's , Katie O'Halloran , came on the scene and spoilt my little romance . ”
95134	95150	95077	95077	Hadria	211	“ I wonder why she married this man ? I wonder why the wind blows ? ”
95170	95176	95177	95177	Hadria	211	“ O sleek wedding guests , ”
95181	95228	95177	95177	Hadria	211	“ how solemnly they sat there , like all - knowing sphinxes , watching , watching , and that child so helpless — handcuffed , manacled ! How many prayers will be offered at the shrine of the goddess of Duty within the next twelve months ! ”
95299	95316	95318	95319	Lady Engleton	176	“ Only the traditional ideas carried out by a woman of narrow mind and strong will , ”
95321	95341	95318	95319	Lady Engleton	176	“ Oh those traditional ideas ! They might have issued fresh and hot from an asylum for criminal lunatics . ”
95342	95350	95269	95269	her	179	“ You are deliciously absurd , Hadria . ”
95351	95361	95362	95362	she	211	“ It is the criminal lunatics who are absurd , ”
95365	95382	95362	95362	she	211	“ Do you remember how those poor girls used to bewail the restrictions to their reading ? ”
95383	95434	95435	95435	Hadria	211	“ Yes , it was really a reductio ad absurdum of our system . The girls seemed afraid to face anything . They would rather die than think . ( I wonder why Professor Theobald lingers so up there by the chancel ? The time must be getting on . ) ”
95453	95494	95444	95444	She	211	“ What became of their personality all that time I can not imagine : their woman 's nature that one hears so much about , and from which such prodigious feats were to be looked for , in the future . ”
95495	95512	95514	95515	Lady Engleton	176	“ Yes , that is where the inconsistency of a girl 's education strikes me most , ”
95517	95562	95514	95515	Lady Engleton	176	“ If she were intended for the cloister one could understand it . But since she is brought up for the express purpose of being married , it does seem a little absurd not to prepare her a little more for her future life . ”
95563	95566	95568	95568	Hadria	211	“ Exactly , ”
95570	95624	95568	95568	Hadria	211	“ if the orthodox are really sincere in declaring that life to be so sacred and desirable , why on earth do n't they treat it frankly and reverently and teach their girls to understand and respect it , instead of allowing a furtive , sneaky , detestable spirit to hover over it ? ”
95625	95634	95636	95637	Lady Engleton	176	“ Yes , I agree with you there , ”
95639	95725	95636	95637	Lady Engleton	176	“ And if they do n't really in their hearts think it sacred and so on ( and how they can , under our present conditions , I fail to see ) , why do they deliberately bring up their girls to be married , as they bring up their sons to a profession ? It is inconceivable , and yet good people do it , without a suspicion of the real nature of their conduct , which it would n't be polite to describe . ”
95798	95804	95806	95807	Lady Engleton	176	“ This is disgraceful conduct ! ”
95823	95836	95837	95837	she	211	“ You have led me on , and must take the consequences ! ”
95840	95843	95844	95844	she	211	“ Imagine , ”
95850	95881	95844	95844	she	211	“ if Marion , on any day previous to this , had gone to her mother and expressed an overpowering maternal instinct — a deep desire to have a child ! ”
95882	95886	95888	95889	Lady Engleton	176	“ Good heavens ! ”
95891	95902	95888	95889	Lady Engleton	176	“ Why so shocked , since it is so holy ? ”
95903	95909	95844	95844	she	211	“ But that is different . ”
95910	95937	95844	95844	she	211	“ Ah ! then it is holy only when the social edict goes forth , and proclaims the previous evil good and the previous good evil . ”
95938	95961	95962	95962	Hadria	211	“ Come , come ; the inconsistency is not quite so bad as that . ( How that man does dawdle ! ) ”
95967	96087	95962	95962	Hadria	211	“ It seems to me so ; for now suppose , on the other hand , that this same Marion , on any day subsequent to this , should go to that same mother , and announce an exactly opposite feeling — a profound objection to the maternal function — how would she be received ? Heavens , with what pained looks , with what platitudes and proverbs , with what reproofs and axioms and sentiments ! She would issue forth from that interview like another St. Sebastian , stuck all over with wounds and arrows . ‘ Sacred mission , ’ ‘ tenderest joy , ’ ‘ holiest mission , ’ ‘ highest vocation’—one knows the mellifluous phrases . ”
96088	96107	96109	96110	Lady Engleton	176	“ But after all she would be wrong in her objection . The instinct is a true one , ”
96112	96133	96109	96110	Lady Engleton	176	“ Oh , then why should she be pelted for expressing it previously , if the question is not indiscreet ? ”
96134	96153	95962	95962	Hadria	211	“ Well , it would seem rather gruesome , if girls were to be overpowered with that passion . ”
96154	96220	96109	96110	Lady Engleton	176	“ So we are all to be horribly shocked at the presence of an instinct to - day , and then equally shocked and indignant at its absence to - morrow ; our sentiment being determined by the performance or otherwise of the ceremony we have just witnessed . It really shows a touching confidence in the swift adaptability of the woman 's sentimental organization ! ”
96285	96287	96271	96271	She	176	“ advanced ”
96368	96381	96382	96382	Hadria	211	“ You are in a mixed condition of feeling , I see , ”
96385	96449	96382	96382	Hadria	211	“ I am not surprised . Our whole scheme of things indeed is so mixed , that the wonder only is we are not all in a state of chronic lunacy . I believe , as a matter of fact , that we are ; but as we are all lunatics together , there is no one left to put us into asylums . ”
96454	96464	96465	96465	she	176	“ The present age is truly a strange one , ”
96468	96500	96465	96465	she	176	“ Do you think so ? It always seems to me that the present age is finding out for the first time how very strange all the other ages have been . ”
96501	96544	96382	96382	Hadria	211	“ However that may be , it seems to me , that a sort of shiver is going through all Society , as if it had suddenly become very much aware of things and could n't make them out — nor itself . ”
96545	96571	96382	96382	Hadria	211	“ Like a creature beginning to struggle through a bad illness . I do think it is all extremely remarkable , especially the bad illness . ”
96572	96581	96583	96584	Lady Engleton	176	“ You are as strange as your epoch , ”
96585	96599	96382	96382	Hadria	211	“ It is a sorry sign when one remarks health instead of disease . ”
96600	96613	96382	96382	Hadria	211	“ Upon my word , you have a wholesome confidence in yourself ! ”
96614	96628	96629	96629	Hadria	211	“ I do not , in that respect , differ from my kind , ”
96633	96652	96629	96629	Hadria	211	“ It is that which was that seems to you astonishing , not that which is to be , ”
96659	96681	96653	96654	Lady Engleton	176	“ For my part I confess I am frightened , almost terrified at times , at that which is to be . ”
96682	96701	96703	96703	Hadria	211	“ I am frightened , terrified , so that the thought becomes unbearable , at that which is , ”
96721	96743	96711	96712	Lady Engleton	176	“ The maternal instinct — yes ; it seems to be round that unacknowledged centre that the whole storm is raging . ”
96744	96809	96653	96654	Lady Engleton	176	“ A desperate question that Society shrinks from in terror : whether women shall be expected to conduct themselves as if the instinct had been weighed out accurately , like weekly stores , and given to all alike , or whether choice and individual feeling is to be held lawful in this matter — there is the red - hot heart of the battle . ”
96810	96835	96853	96853	Hadria	211	“ Remember men of science are against freedom in this respect . ( I do wish our man of science would make haste . ) ”
96836	96851	96853	96853	Hadria	211	“ They rush to the rescue when they see the sentimental defences giving way , ”
96855	96878	96853	96853	Hadria	211	“ If the ‘ sacred privilege ’ and ‘ noblest vocation ’ safeguards wo n't hold , science must throw up entrenchments . ”
96879	96892	96894	96895	Lady Engleton	176	“ I prefer the more romantic and sentimental presentment of the matter , ”
96897	97005	96894	96895	Lady Engleton	176	“ Naturally . Ah ! it is pathetic , the way we have tried to make things decorative ; but it wo n't hold out much longer . Women are driving their masters to plain speaking — the ornaments are being dragged down . And what do we find ? Bare and very ugly fact . And if we venture to hint that this unsatisfactory skeleton may be modified in form , science becomes stern . She wishes things , in this department , left as they are . Women are made for purposes of reproduction ; let them clearly understand that . No picking and choosing . ”
97006	97016	97018	97019	Lady Engleton	176	“ Men pick and choose , it is true , ”
97030	97115	97018	97019	Lady Engleton	176	“ Ah , but that 's different — a real scientific argument , though a superficial observer might not credit it . At any rate , it is quite sufficiently scientific for this particular subject . Our leaders of thought do n't bring out their Sunday - best logic on this question . They lounge in dressing - gown and slippers . One gets to know the oriental pattern of that dressing - gown and the worn - down heels of those old slippers . ”
97116	97127	97129	97130	Lady Engleton	176	“ They may be right though , notwithstanding their logic , ”
97132	97155	97129	97130	Lady Engleton	176	“ By good luck , not good guidance . I wonder what her Serene Highness Science would say if she heard us ? ”
97156	97166	96894	96895	Lady Engleton	176	“ That we two ignorant creatures are very presumptuous . ”
97167	97184	97185	97186	Lady Engleton	176	“ Yes , people always fall back on that , when they ca n't refute you . ”
97189	97219	97185	97186	Lady Engleton	176	“ I should like to hear the question discussed by really competent persons . ( Well , if luncheon is dead cold it will be his own fault . ) ”
97220	97295	97296	97296	Hadria	211	“ Oh , really competent persons will tell us all about the possibilities of woman : her feelings , desires , capabilities , and limitations , now and for all time to come . And the wildly funny thing is that women are ready , with open mouths , to reverently swallow this male verdict on their inherent nature , as if it were gospel divinely inspired . I may appear a little inconsistent , ”
97302	97311	97296	97296	Hadria	211	“ but I do think women are fools ! ”
97358	97368	97369	97369	she	211	“ Fools , fools , unutterable , irredeemable fools ! ”
97373	97386	97369	97369	she	211	“ My dear , my dear , we are in a churchyard , ”
97394	97401	97403	97403	Hadria	211	“ We are at this grave , ”
97405	97431	97403	97403	Hadria	211	“ The poor woman would have been among the first to approve of the whole scheme , though it places her here beneath the daisies . ”
97432	97454	97455	97455	she	211	“ Exactly . Am I not justified then in crying ‘ fool ’ ? Do n't imagine that I exclude myself , ”
97458	97483	97485	97486	Lady Engleton	176	“ I think you might be less liable to error if you were rather more of a fool , if I may say so , ”
97488	97536	97485	97486	Lady Engleton	176	“ Oh error ! I daresay . One can guard against that , after a fashion , by never making a stretch after truth . And the reward comes , of its kind . How green the grave is . The grass grows so fast on graves . ”
97552	97562	97564	97564	Hadria	211	“ Oh , you need n't unless you like ! ”
97569	97647	97564	97564	Hadria	211	“ Indeed a churchyard might rather teach us what nonsense it is to take things seriously — our little affairs . This poor woman , a short while ago , was dying of grief and shame and agony , and the village was stirred with excitement , as if the solar system had come to grief . It all seemed so stupendous and important , yet now — look at that tall grass waving in the wind ! ”
97751	97763	97765	97766	Lady Engleton	176	“ I ca n't understand why he does not join us , ”
97768	97795	97796	97796	she	176	“ It must be nearly luncheon time . However , it does n't much matter , as everyone seems to be up here . I wonder , ”
97803	97818	97796	97796	she	176	“ what the bride would think if she had heard our conversation this morning ! ”
97819	97833	97835	97835	Hadria	211	“ Probably she would recognize many a half - thought of her own , ”
97843	97875	97840	97840	her	176	“ They alarm me , all these ideas . For myself , I feel bound to accept the decision of wise and good men , who have studied social questions deeply . ”
97891	97922	97923	97924	Lady Engleton	176	“ I do not feel competent to judge in a matter so complex , and must be content to abide by the opinions of those who have knowledge and experience . ”
98024	98030	98032	98032	she	211	“ good and wise men , ”
98200	98226	98227	98227	she	176	“ I fear there is an element of the morbid , in all this fretful revolt against the old - established destiny of our sex , ”
98288	98310	98311	98311	he	2311	“ Seems only yesterday as we was a diggin ' o ' that there grave , do n't it , mum ? ”
98328	98363	98311	98311	he	2311	“ It does indeed , Dodge . I see you have been tidying it up and clearing away the moss from the name . I can read it now . Ellen Jervis.—Requiescat in pace . ”
98364	98379	98380	98380	Hadria	211	“ We was a wonderin ' wot that meant , me and my missus . ”
98383	98419	98380	98380	Hadria	211	“ Oh indeed , mum . She did n't die in peace , whatever she be a doin' now , not she did n't , pore thing . I was jest a tellin ' the gentleman ”
98434	98557	98380	98380	Hadria	211	“ about the schoolmarm . He was talkin ' like a sermon — beautiful — about the times wen the church was built ; and about them as come over from France and beat the English — shameful thing for our soldiers , ' pears to me , not as I believes all them tales . Mr. Walker says as learnin ' is a pitfall , which I do n't swaller everything as Mr. Walker says neither . Seems to me as it do n't do to be always believin ' wot 's told yer , or there 's no sayin ' wot sort o ' things you would n't come to find inside o ' yer , before you 'd done . ”
98619	98626	98628	98629	Lady Engleton	176	“ Dodge is a born sceptic , ”
98631	98679	98680	98680	Dodge	155	“ What would you say , Dodge , if some tiresome , reasonable person were to come and point out something to you that you could n't honestly deny , and yet that seemed to upset all the ideas that you had felt were truest and best ? ”
98685	98697	98699	98699	Dodge	155	“ I should say as what he said was n't true , ”
98701	98714	98699	98699	Dodge	155	“ But if you could n't help seeing that it was true ? ”
98715	98721	98722	98722	Dodge	155	“ That ud be arkard , ”
98725	98732	98722	98722	Dodge	155	“ Then what would you do ? ”
98752	98756	98757	98757	he	2312	“ I think , ”
98762	98771	98757	98757	he	2312	“ as I should n't do nothin' partic'lar . ”

98785	98798	98782	98782	Hadria	211	“ What could more simply describe the action of our Great Majority ? ”
98799	98811	98813	98814	Lady Engleton	176	“ You are positively impish in your mood to - day ! ”
98816	98845	98813	98814	Lady Engleton	176	“ What should we do without our Great Majority , as you call it ? It is absolutely necessary to put some curb on the wild impulses of pure reason”—a
98881	98893	98895	98896	Lady Engleton	176	“ What are they lingering for so long , I wonder ? ”
98899	98917	98895	98896	Lady Engleton	176	“ Professor Theobald is really too instructive to - day . I will go and hurry him . ”
98925	98951	98953	98954	the Professor	4071	“ I was merely waiting for you two ladies to move ; I would have come on with Mr. Fleming . I am extremely sorry , ”
98995	99007	99009	99010	Lady Engleton	176	“ It appears that we were all waiting for each other , ”
99012	99036	99038	99038	Dodge	155	“ This ' ere 's the young woman 's grave , sir — Ellen Jervis—'er as I was a tellin ' you of , ”
99050	99058	99060	99061	the Professor	4071	“ Oh , yes ; very nice , ”
99070	99083	99064	99064	Hadria	211	“ I mean — pretty spot — well chosen — well made . ”
99089	99100	99101	99101	she	211	“ I never heard less skilled comment on a grave ! ”
99104	99111	99101	99101	she	211	“ It might be a pagoda ! ”
99112	99137	99060	99061	the Professor	4071	“ It 's not so easy as you seem to imagine to find distinctive epithets . I challenge you . Begin with the pagoda . ”
99138	99159	99179	99179	Dodge	155	“ None of the first canons of criticism is never to attempt the feat yourself ; jeer rather at others . ”
99160	99177	99179	99179	Dodge	155	“ The children do n't like the new schoolmarm near so well as this ' un , ”
99188	99329	99179	99179	Dodge	155	“ Lord , it was an unfort'nate thing , for there was n't a better girl nor she were in all Craddock ( as I was a tellin ' of you , sir ) , not when she fust come as pupil teacher . It was all along of her havin' no friends , and her mother far away . She used to say to me at times of an afternoon wen she was a passin ' through the churchyard—‘Dodge , ’ says she , ‘ do you know I have no one to care for , or to care for me , in all the world ? ’ I used to comfort her like , and say as there was plenty in Craddock as cared for her , but she always shook her head , sort o ' sad . ”
99330	99334	99335	99336	Lady Engleton	176	“ Poor thing ! ”
99339	99376	99335	99336	Lady Engleton	176	“ And one mornin ' a good time after , I found her a cryin ' bitter , just there by her own grave , much about where the gentleman ' as his foot at this moment ”
99385	99576	99335	99336	Lady Engleton	176	“ It was in the dusk o ' the evenin ' , and she was a settin ' on the rail of old Squire Jordan 's grave , jes ' where you are now , sir . We were sort o ' friendly , and wen I heard ' er a taking on so bad , I jes ' went and stood alongside , and I sez , ‘ Wy Ellen Jervis , ’ I sez , ‘ vot be you a cryin ' for ? ’ But she kep ' on sobbin ' and would n't answer nothin' . So I waited , and jes ' went on with my work a bit , and then I sez again , ‘ Ellen Jervis , wot be you a cryin ' for ? ’ And then she took her hands from her face and she sez , ‘ Because I am that miserable , ’ sez she , and she broke out cryin ' wuss than ever . ‘ Dear , dear , ’ I sez , ‘ vot is it ? Ca n't somebody do nothin' for you ? ’ “

99682	99699	99649	99649	she	0	” observed Professor Theobald nervously , with a glance at Hadria , as if expecting derision . “

99821	99920	99778	99778	I	0	” said Lady Engleton . Dodge hoped it would , but there was something in the turn of his head that seemed to denote a disposition to base his calculations on this , rather than on the other world . He was expected home by his wife , at this hour , so wishing the company good day , and pocketing the Professor 's gratuity with a gleam of satisfaction in his shrewd and honest face , he trudged off with his broom down the path , and out by the wicket - gate into the village street . “
99931	99948	99921	99921	I	0	” said Lady Engleton , when the gravedigger had left . It was new to everybody . “
99962	99978	99979	99979	I	0	” Hadria was silent . Professor Theobald cast a quick , scrutinizing glance at her . “
99997	100031	99985	99985	you	0	” Lady Engleton remarked . They were strolling down the path , and Professor Theobald was holding open the gate for his companions to pass through . His hand seemed to shake slightly . “
100043	100047	100032	100032	I	0	” said Hadria . “

100199	100209	100196	100197	Mrs. Temperley	154	” Lady Engleton 's tone was one of reproach . “
100234	100235	100231	100232	Ellen Jervis	184	” “
100248	100249	100241	100242	two sinners	2346	” “

100291	100302	100304	100305	Professor Theobald	181	” No good ever came of mere revenge , however , ”
100307	100321	100323	100323	Hadria	211	“ Sometimes that is the only form of remonstrance that is listened to , ”
100325	100352	100323	100323	Hadria	211	“ When people have the law in their own hands and Society at their back , they can afford to be deaf to mere verbal protest . ”
100353	100359	100361	100362	Lady Engleton	176	“ As for the child , ”
100364	100380	100361	100362	Lady Engleton	176	“ she will be in no little danger of a fate like her mother 's . ”
100386	100480	100381	100381	Hadria	211	“ At least then , she shall have some free and happy hours first ; at least she shall not be driven to it by the misery of moral starvation , starvation of the affections . She shall be protected from the solemn fools — with sawdust for brains and a mechanical squeaker for heart — who , on principle , cut off from her mother all joy and all savour in life , and then punished her for falling a victim to the starved emotional condition to which they had reduced her . ”
100481	100487	100489	100490	Lady Engleton	176	“ The matter seems complex , ”
100492	100503	100489	100490	Lady Engleton	176	“ and I do n't see how revenge comes in . ”
100504	100525	100381	100381	Hadria	211	“ It is a passion that has never been eradicated . Oh , if I could but find that man ! ”
100526	100542	100381	100381	Hadria	211	“ A man is a hard thing to punish,—unless he is in love with one . ”
100543	100552	100554	100554	Hadria	211	“ Well , let him be in love ! ”
100701	100708	100687	100688	the composer	2359	“ a sudden storm among mountains , ”
100709	100718	100687	100688	the composer	2359	“ the wind - swept heavens at midnight , ”
100719	100723	100725	100725	he	2359	“ the lonely sea ”
100848	100858	100860	100861	the Professor	4071	“ There is a strong Celtic element in it , ”
100863	100897	100860	100861	the Professor	4071	“ This is a very wonderful gift . I suppose one never does really know one 's fellows : her music to - night reveals to me new sides of Hadria 's character . ”
100898	100905	100907	100907	Algitha	81	“ I confess they alarm me , ”
100909	100950	100907	100907	Algitha	81	“ Truly , this is not the sort of power that can be safely shut up and stifled . It is the sort of power for which everything ought to be set aside . That is my impression of it . ”
100951	100958	100959	100959	Algitha	81	“ I am worried about Hadria , ”
100962	101019	100959	100959	Algitha	81	“ I know her better than most people , and I know how hard she takes things and what explosive force that musical instinct of hers has . Yet , it is impossible , as things are , for her to give it real utterance . She can only open the furnace door now and then . ”
101027	101047	101023	101023	his	4071	“ It wo n't do : it is n't safe . And why should such a gift be lost ? ”
101048	101156	100907	100907	Algitha	81	“ That 's what I say ! Yet what is to be done ? There is no one really to blame . As for Hubert , I am sorry for him . He had not the faintest idea of Hadria 's character , though she did her best to enlighten him . It is hard for him ( since he feels it so ) and it is desperate for her . You are such an old friend , that I feel I may speak to you about it . You see what is going on , and I know it is troubling you as it does me . ”
101157	101226	101023	101023	his	4071	“ It is indeed . If I am not very greatly mistaken , here is real musical genius of the first order , going to waste : strong forces being turned in upon the nature , to its own destruction ; and , as you say , it seems as if nothing could be done . It is the more ironically cruel , since Hubert is himself musical . ”
101227	101326	101023	101023	his	4071	“ Oh , yes , but in quite a different way . His fetish is good taste , or what he thinks such . Hadria 's compositions set his teeth on edge . His nature is conventional through and through . He fears adverse comment more than any earthly thing . And yet the individual opinions that compose the general ‘ talk ’ that he so dreads , are nothing to him . He despises them heartily . But he would give his soul ( and particularly Hadria 's ) rather than incur a whisper from people collectively . ”
101327	101354	100907	100907	Algitha	81	“ That is a very common trait . If we feared only the opinions that we respect , our fear would cover but a small area . ”
101473	101480	101482	101482	Algitha	81	“ And the maddening thing is , ”
101484	101512	101482	101482	Algitha	81	“ that there is nobody to swear at . Swearing at systems and ideas , as Hadria says , is a Barmecide feast to one 's vindictiveness . ”
101513	101532	101533	101534	the Professor	4071	“ It is the tyranny of affection that has done so much to ruin the lives of women , ”
101547	101563	101533	101534	the Professor	4071	“ I fear your poor mother has never got over your little revolt , Algitha . ”
101564	101638	101482	101482	Algitha	81	“ Never , I am sorry to say . If I had married and settled in Hongkong , she would scarcely have minded , but as it is , she feels deserted . Of course the boys are away from home more than I am , yet she is not grieved at that . You see how vast these claims are . Nothing less than one 's entire life and personality will suffice . ”
101639	101676	101533	101534	the Professor	4071	“ Your mother feels that you are throwing your life away , remember . But truly it seems , sometimes , as if people were determined to turn affection into a curse instead of a blessing ! ”
101677	101688	101689	101689	Algitha	81	“ I never think of it in any other light , ”
101697	101707	101708	101708	he	4071	“ Oh , there are exceptions , I hope , ”
101711	101776	101708	101708	he	4071	“ Love , like everything else that is great , is very , very rare . We call the disposition to usurp and absorb another person by that name , but woe betide him or her who is the object of such a sentiment . Yet happily , the real thing is to be found now and again . And from that arises freedom . ”
101795	101807	101809	101809	Algitha	81	“ I think Hadria has something of the gipsy in her , ”
101811	101850	101809	101809	Algitha	81	“ She is so utterly and hopelessly unfitted to be the wife of a prim , measured , elegant creature like Hubert — good fellow though he is — and to settle down for life at Craddock Dene . ”
101851	101854	101856	101857	the Professor	4071	“ Yes , ”
101859	101884	101856	101857	the Professor	4071	“ it has occurred to me , more than once , that there must be a drop of nomad blood somewhere among the ancestry . ”
101885	101899	101900	101900	He	4071	“ Hadria always says herself , that she is a vagabond in disguise . ”
101937	102029	101923	101923	he	4071	“ The fact of the matter is , that in this world , the dead weight of the mass bears heavily upon the exceptional natures . It comes home to one vividly , in cases like this . The stupidity and blindness of each individual goes to build up the dead wall , the impassable obstacle , for some other spirit . The burden that we have cast upon the world has to be borne by our fellow man or woman , and perhaps is doomed to crush a human soul . ”
102030	102045	102047	102047	Algitha	81	“ It seems to me that most people are engaged in that crushing industry , ”
102052	102069	102047	102047	Algitha	81	“ Do n't I know their bonnets , and their frock - coats and their sneers ! ”
102096	102146	102089	102091	The same spirit	2372	“ While we are sneering at our fellow mortal , and assuring him loftily that he can certainly prevail , if only he is strong enough , it may be our particular dulness or our hardness that is dragging him down to a tragic failure , before our eyes . ”
102427	102434	102436	102436	Hadria	211	“ It is like a prophecy , ”
102438	102447	102436	102436	Hadria	211	“ To - morrow the dawn , remember . ”
102518	102521	102522	102522	he	4071	“ Life , ”
102525	102543	102522	102522	he	4071	“ offers her gifts as the Sibyl her books ; they grow fewer as we refuse them . ”
102544	102575	102511	102512	the Professor	4071	“ Ah ! that is the truth that clamours in my brain , warning and pointing to an empty temple , like the deserted sky , a little while ahead . ”
102576	102581	102511	102512	the Professor	4071	“ Be warned then . ”
102582	102641	102522	102522	he	4071	“ Ah ! but what to do ? I am out of myself now with the spring ; there are so many benign influences . I too have winged islands , and wild ranges where the dreams dwell ; life is a fairy - tale ; but there is always that terror of the departure of the sun . ”
102642	102646	102511	102512	the Professor	4071	“ Carpe diem . ”
102682	102689	102690	102690	he	4071	“ You have a great gift , ”
102693	102710	102690	102690	he	4071	“ One is afraid of taking a thing too seriously because it is one 's own . ”
102717	102794	102711	102712	The Professor	4071	“ Good heavens , what does it matter whose it is ? There may be a sort of inverted vanity in refusing fair play to a power , on that ground . Alas ! here is one of the first morbid signs of the evil at work upon you . If you had been wholesomely moving and striving in the right direction , do you think you would have been guilty of that piece of egotism ? ”
102795	102825	102690	102690	he	4071	“ Vanity pursues one into hidden corners of the mind . I am so used to that sort of spirit among women . Apparently I have caught the infection . ”
102826	102835	102837	102838	the Professor	4071	“ I would not let it go farther , ”
102840	102852	102854	102854	Hadria	211	“ To do myself justice , I think it is superficial , ”
102859	102875	102876	102876	she	211	“ I would dare anything , anything for a chance of freedom , for — , ”
102882	103039	102876	102876	she	211	“ I remember once — years ago , when I was quite a girl — seeing a young ash - tree that had got jammed into a chink so that it could n't grow straight , or spread , as its inner soul , poor stripling , evidently inspired it to grow . Outside , there were hundreds of upright , vigorous , healthful young trees , fulfilling that innate idea in apparent gladness , and with obvious general advantage , since they were growing into sound , valuable trees , straight of trunk , nobly developed . I felt like the poor sapling in the cranny , that had just the same natural impetus of healthy growth as all the others , but was forced to become twisted , and crooked , and stunted and wretched . I think most women have to grow in a cranny . It is generally known as their Sphere . ”
103046	103050	103051	103051	Hadria	211	“ I noticed , ”
103054	103117	103051	103051	Hadria	211	“ that the desperate struggle to grow of that young tree had begun to loosen the masonry of the edifice that cramped it . There was a great dangerous - looking crack right across the building . The tree was not saved from deformity , but it had its revenge ! Some day that noble institution would come down by the run . ”
103118	103134	103136	103137	the Professor	4071	“ Yes . Well , the thing to do is to get out of it , ”
103139	103145	103136	103137	the Professor	4071	“ You really advise that ? ”
103146	103168	103051	103051	Hadria	211	“ Advise ? One dare not advise . It is too perilous . No general theories will hold in all instances . ”
103169	103173	103175	103175	Hadria	211	“ Tell me , ”
103177	103196	103175	103175	Hadria	211	“ what are the qualities in a human being that make him most serviceable , or least harmful ? ”
103197	103201	103202	103203	Professor Fortescue	116	“ What qualities ? ”
103236	103310	103225	103225	He	116	“ Mental integrity , and mercy . A resolute following of reason ( in which I should include insight ) to its conclusion , though the heavens fall , and an unfailing fellow - feeling for the pain and struggle and heartache and sin that life is so full of . But one must add the quality of imagination . Without imagination and its fruits , the world would be a howling wilderness . ”
103311	103342	103344	103344	Algitha	81	“ I wish you would come down with me , some day , to the East End and hold out the hand of fellowship to some of the sufferers there , ”
103346	103390	103344	103344	Algitha	81	“ I am , at times , almost in despair at the mass of evil to be fought against , but somehow you always make me feel , Professor , that the race has all the qualities necessary for redemption enfolded within itself . ”
103391	103397	103399	103400	the Professor	4071	“ But assuredly it has ! ”
103402	103455	103399	103400	the Professor	4071	“ And assuredly those redeeming qualities will germinate . Otherwise the race would extinguish itself in cruelty and corruption . Let people talk as they please about the struggle for existence , it is through the development of the human mind and the widening of human mercy that better things will come . ”
103456	103476	103478	103478	Hadria	211	“ One sees , now and then , in a flash , what the world may some day be , ”
103480	103524	103478	103478	Hadria	211	“ The vision comes , perhaps , with the splendour of a spring morning , or opens , scroll - like , in a flood of noble music . It sounds unreal , yet it brings a sense of conviction that is irresistible . ”
103525	103546	103548	103549	the Professor	4071	“ I think it was Pythagoras who declared that the woes of men are the work of their own hands , ”
103551	103576	103548	103549	the Professor	4071	“ So are their joys . Nothing ever shakes my belief that what the mind of man can imagine , that it can achieve . ”
103577	103588	103590	103590	Algitha	81	“ But there are so many pulling the wrong way , ”
103593	103617	103590	103590	Algitha	81	“ Ah , one man may be miserable through the deeds of others ; the race can only be miserable through its own . ”
103702	103703	103688	103688	Algitha	81	“ others”—those
103707	103708	103712	103712	their	2401	“ others”—had
103871	103892	103952	103952	Hadria	211	“ Then you think a person — even a feminine person — justified in giving pain by resisting unjust demands ? ”
103893	103930	103952	103952	Hadria	211	“ I certainly think that all attempts to usurp another person 's life on the plea of affection should be stoutly resisted . But I recognise that cases must often occur when resistance is practically impossible . ”
103931	103950	103952	103952	Hadria	211	“ One ought not to be too easily melted by the ‘ shrieks of a near relation , ’ ”
103954	104026	103952	103952	Hadria	211	“ Ah , I have a good mind to try . I do n't fear any risk for myself , nor any work ; the stake is worth it . I do n't want to grow cramped and crooked , like my poor ash - tree . Perhaps this may be a form of vanity too ; I do n't know , I was going to say I do n't care . ”
104103	104107	104108	104108	she	211	“ I wonder , ”
104115	104132	104108	104108	she	211	“ why it is that when we know for dead certain , we call it faith . ”
104133	104176	104108	104108	she	211	“ Because , I suppose , our certainty is certainty only for ourselves . If you have found some such conviction to guide you in this wild world , you are very fortunate . We need all our courage and our strength — ”
104177	104184	104185	104185	Hadria	211	“ And just a little more , ”
104188	104205	104185	104185	Hadria	211	“ Yes ; sometimes just a little more , to save us from its worst pitfalls . ”
104225	104243	104244	104244	Hadria	211	“ You are always giving help and sympathy to others , and you never get any yourself ! ”
104282	104314	104368	104369	the Professor	4071	“ I am very glad to have Professor Fortescue 's opinion of your composition , Hadria . I was talking to him about you , and he quite agrees with me . ”
104315	104324	104368	104369	the Professor	4071	“ What ? that I ought to — ? ”
104325	104341	104368	104369	the Professor	4071	“ That you ought not to go on as you are going on at present . ”
104342	104349	104368	104369	the Professor	4071	“ But that is so vague . ”
104350	104366	104368	104369	the Professor	4071	“ I suppose you have long ago tried all the devices of self - discipline ? ”
104371	104417	104368	104369	the Professor	4071	“ There are ways , of course , of arming oneself against minor difficulties , of living within a sort of citadel . Naturally much force has to go in keeping up the defences , but it is better than having none to keep up . ”
104424	104501	104503	104503	her	2416	“ There is not a method , mental or other , that I have not tried , and tried hard . If it had not been for the sternest self - discipline , my mind at this moment , would be so honeycombed with small pre - occupations ( pleasant and otherwise ) , that it would be incapable of consecutive ideas of any kind . As it is , I feel a miserable number of holes here”—she
104504	104605	104368	104369	the Professor	4071	brow—“a loss of absorbing power , at times , and a mental slackness that is really alarming . What remains of me has been dragged ashore as from a wreck , amidst a rush of wind and wave . But just now , thanks greatly to your sympathy and Algitha 's , I seem restored to myself . I can never describe the rapture of that sensation to one who has never felt himself sinking down and down into darkness , to a dim hell , where the doom is a slow decay instead of the fiery pains of burning . ”
104606	104614	104616	104617	the Professor	4071	“ This is all wrong , wrong ! ”
104620	104779	104616	104617	the Professor	4071	“ Ah ! but I feel now , such certainty , such courage . It seems as if Fate were giving me one more chance . I have often run very close to making a definite decision — to dare everything rather than await this fool 's disaster . But then comes that everlasting feminine humility , sneaking up with its simper : ‘ Is not this presumptuous , selfish , mistaken , wrong ? What business have you , one out of so many , to break roughly through the delicate web that has been spun for your kindly detention ? ’ Of course my retort is : ‘ What business have they to spin the web ? ’ But one can never get up a real sense of injured innocence . It is always the spiders who seem injured and innocent . However , this time I am going to try , though the heavens fall ! ”
104837	104840	104842	104842	Hadria	211	“ Ah ! ”
104844	104861	104842	104842	Hadria	211	“ heaven helps him who helps himself ! This will fit in neatly with my plans . ”
104886	104906	104907	104907	Hadria	211	“ Valeria , do you know anyone in Paris to whom you could give me a letter of introduction ? ”
104929	104936	104937	104937	Valeria	109	“ Are you going to Paris ? ”
104942	104960	104937	104937	Valeria	109	“ Please write the letter and I will tell you some day what I want it for . ”
104961	104969	105132	105134	Miss Du Prel	109	“ Nothing very mad , I hope ? ”
104970	104980	104937	104937	Valeria	109	“ No , only a little — judiciously mad . ”
104981	105039	105040	105040	Valeria	109	“ Well , there is Madame Bertaux , in the Avenue Kleber , but her you know already . Let me see . Oh yes , Madame Vauchelet , a charming woman ; very kind and very fond of young people . She is about sixty ; a widow ; her husband was in the diplomatic service . ”
105050	105117	105040	105040	Valeria	109	“ She is musical too , and will introduce you , perhaps , to the great Joubert , and others of that set . You will like her , I am sure . She is one of the truly good people of this world . If you really are going to Paris , I shall feel happier if I know that Madame Vauchlelet is your friend . ”
105505	105517	105519	105519	Henriette	142	“ The moral training of young minds is such a problem , ”
105527	105537	105519	105519	Henriette	142	“ it must cause you many an anxious thought . ”
105551	105559	105560	105560	she	211	“ The boys are so young yet , ”
105564	105577	105560	105560	she	211	“ I have no doubt that will all come , later on . ”
105578	105591	105519	105519	Henriette	142	“ But , my dear Hadria , unless they are trained now — ”
105592	105601	105560	105560	she	211	“ Oh , there is plenty of time ! ”
105602	105610	105560	105560	she	211	“ Do you mean to say — ? ”
105611	105678	105519	105519	Henriette	142	“ Only what other people say . Nothing in the least original , I assure you . I see the folly and the inconvenience of that now . I have consulted hoary experience . I have sat reverently at the feet of old nurses . I have talked with mothers in the spirit of a disciple , and I have learnt , oh , so much ! ”
105679	105693	105695	105695	Henriette	142	“ Mothers are most anxious about the moral training of their little ones , ”
105701	105738	105695	105695	Henriette	142	“ Of course , but they do n't worry about it so early . One ca n't expect accomplished morality from poor little dots of five and six . The charm of infancy would be gone . ”
105847	105856	105858	105858	Henriette	142	“ But meanwhile the children are growing up ! ”
106064	106105	106053	106053	she	211	“ Do you think it quite wise , Henriette , to run dead against the customs of ages ? Do you think it safe to ignore the opinion of countless generations of those who were older and wiser than ourselves ? ”
106106	106115	106117	106118	Miss Temperley	141	“ Dear me , how you have changed ! ”
106120	106130	106131	106131	Hadria	211	“ Advancing years ; the sobering effects of experience , ”
106215	106242	106253	106253	Hadria	211	“ But , my dear Hadria , it is just the early years that are the impressionable years . Nothing can quite erase those first impressions . ”
106243	106251	106253	106253	Hadria	211	“ Oh , do you think so ? ”
106256	106265	106267	106267	Henriette	142	“ Yes , indeed , I think so , ”
106273	106284	106270	106270	her	142	“ Oh , well of course you may be right . ”
106432	106440	106441	106441	Henriette	142	“ Perhaps the precautions made them delicate , ”
106452	106469	106471	106471	her	211	“ Take care of the colds , and the fresh air will take care of itself , ”
106475	106514	106471	106471	her	211	“ But , my dear Hadria , do you mean to tell me that the people about here are so benighted as really not to understand the importance to the system of a constant supply of pure air ? ”
106526	106529	106530	106530	she	211	“ Well , ”
106533	106551	106530	106530	she	211	“ several mothers have mentioned it , but they take more interest in fluid magnesia and tonics . ”
106618	106627	106628	106628	Henriette	142	“ damned nonsense about fresh air and drains ! ”
106631	106648	106649	106649	she	211	“ It is certainly not safe to trust entirely to nurses , however devoted and experienced , ”
106700	106717	106689	106689	Hadria	211	“ Oh ! then one must , of course , expect to be a little stuffy . ”
106718	106721	106723	106724	Miss Temperley	141	“ But , ”
106729	106757	106723	106724	Miss Temperley	141	“ impure air breathed , night after night , is an incessant drain on the strength , even if each time it only does a little harm . ”
106765	106780	106758	106758	Hadria	211	“ Oh , nobody ever objects to things that only do a little harm . ”
106938	106973	106930	106930	She	142	“ Henriette , do n't you think it would be rather a good plan if you were to come and live here and manage affairs — morals , manners , hygiene , and everything ? ”
107000	107009	106997	106997	her	142	“ My dear , what do you mean ? ”
107010	107033	106930	106930	She	142	“ Hubert , of course , would be only too delighted to have you here , and I want to go away . ”
107034	107040	106997	106997	her	142	“ For heaven 's sake — ”
107041	107193	106997	106997	her	142	“ Not exactly for heaven 's sake . For my own sake , I suppose : frankly selfish . It is , perhaps , the particular form that my selfishness takes — an unfortunately conspicuous form . So many of us can have a nice cosy pocket edition that does n't show . However , that 's not the point . I know you would be happier doing this than anything else , and that you would do it perfectly . You have the kind of talent , if I may say so , that makes an admirable ruler . When it has a large political field we call it ‘ administrative ability ’ ; when it has a small domestic one , we speak of it as ‘ good housekeeping . ’ It is a precious quality , wherever it appears . You have no scope for it at present . ”
107386	107396	107397	107397	she	142	“ Now am I without authority in my ideas ? ”
107418	107423	107424	107424	she	142	“ But I believe , ”
107427	107437	107424	107424	she	142	“ that your practice is better than your preaching . ”
107438	107448	107450	107450	Hadria	211	“ It seems to be an ordinance of Nature , ”
107452	107460	107450	107450	Hadria	211	“ that these things shall never correspond . ”
107676	107681	107682	107682	he	181	“ You look tired , ”
107685	107699	107682	107682	he	181	“ I am , rather . The spring is always a little trying . ”
107707	107781	107704	107704	I	0	” The gardens of the Priory were now at the very perfection of their beauty . The supreme moment had come of flowing wealth of foliage and delicate splendour of blossom , yet the paleness of green and tenderness of texture were still there . Professor Theobald said suddenly , that Hadria looked as if she were turning over some project very anxiously in her mind — a project on which much depended . “
107787	107797	107782	107782	You	181	” she replied , after a moment 's hesitation , “
107873	107874	107875	107875	You	181	” “
107882	107883	107879	107880	Mrs. Temperley	154	” “
107904	107905	107886	107886	people	3687	” “
107913	107914	107910	107911	a woman	3753	” “
107925	107926	107910	107911	a woman	3753	” “
107941	107942	107937	107939	a beautiful woman	2494	” “
107949	107953	107937	107939	a beautiful woman	2494	” she said . “
107960	107966	107937	107939	a beautiful woman	2494	” Her smile checked him . “
107980	107981	107982	107982	I	0	” “
107986	107990	107982	107982	I	0	” she said , “
107997	107998	107982	107982	I	0	” “
108023	108024	107982	107982	I	0	” “
108029	108036	107982	107982	I	0	” she observed , looking round . “
108048	108049	108051	108051	you	181	” “
108089	108194	108051	108051	you	181	” Hadria went off to meet Lady Engleton , who was coming down the avenue with Madame Bertaux . Professor Theobald instinctively began to follow and then stopped , reddening , as he met the glance of Miss Temperley . He flung himself into conversation with her , and became especially animated when he was passing Hadria , who did not appear to notice him . As both Professors were to leave Craddock Dene at the end of the week , this was the last meeting in the Priory gardens . Miss Temperley found Professor Theobald entertaining , but at times a little incoherent . “
108203	108207	108212	108212	she	109	” exclaimed Henriette . “
108236	108428	108226	108226	she	109	” This confirmed Professor Theobald 's suspicions that something serious was going on at the Red House . Valeria explained her return to Hadria , by saying that she had felt so nervous about what the latter might be going to attempt , that she had come back to see if she could be of help , or able to ward off any rash adventure . There was a pleasant open space among the shrubberies , where several seats had been placed to command a dainty view of the garden and lawns , with the house in the distance , and here the party gradually converged , in desultory fashion , coming up and strolling off again , as the fancy inspired them . Cigars were lighted , and a sense of sociability and enjoyment suffused itself , like a perfume , among the group . Lady Engleton was delighted to see Miss Du Prel again . She did so want to continue the hot discussion they were having at the Red House that afternoon , when Mr. Temperley would be so horridly logical . He smiled and twisted his moustache . “
108448	108449	108433	108434	some caller	2501	” “
108455	108459	108461	108461	woman	3844	” said Temperley ; “
108469	108470	108461	108461	woman	3844	” “
108492	108497	108498	108498	I	0	” said Professor Theobald . “
108513	108514	108515	108515	You	0	” “
108530	108535	108540	108540	her	3844	” cried Lady Engleton . “
108546	108550	108540	108540	her	3844	” he replied . “
108561	108562	108551	108553	Your future wife	2505	” “
108625	108634	108601	108601	she	1373	” Hubert commended his wisdom in not marrying . “
108663	108664	108665	108665	I	0	” “
108681	108682	108679	108679	Professor	1240	” “
108728	108889	108890	108890	I	0	” Henriette plunged headlong into the fray , in opposition to the Professor 's heresy . The conversation became general . Professor Theobald fell out of it . He was furtively watching Hadria , whose eyes were strangely bright . She was sitting on the arm of a seat , listening to the talk , with a little smile on her lips . Her hand clasped the back of the seat rigidly , as if she were holding something down . The qualities and defects of the female character were frankly canvassed , each view being held with fervour , but expressed with urbanity . Women were always so and so ; women were absolutely never so and so : women felt , without exception , thus and thus ; on the contrary , they were entirely devoid of such sentiments . A large experience and wide observation always supported each opinion , and eminent authorities swarmed to the standard . “
108900	108905	108906	108906	They	606	” said Lady Engleton . “
108913	108927	108906	108906	They	606	” observed Professor Theobald , with a possible second meaning in his words . “
108941	108947	108936	108936	They	606	” was Hubert 's comment . “
108955	108959	108948	108948	They	606	” was asserted . “
108966	108971	108972	108972	They	606	” some one added . “
108980	108981	108982	108982	They	606	” “
108990	109022	108987	108988	the Devil	1352	” exclaimed Hadria . There was a laugh . Hubert thought this was a lack not likely to be felt for very long . It was under rapid process of cultivation . “
109043	109048	109037	109037	she	3753	” cried Lady Engleton . “
109055	109060	109061	109061	I	0	” said Professor Fortescue . “
109064	109065	109061	109061	I	0	” “
109068	109078	109061	109061	I	0	” his colleague murmured , with a faint chuckle . “
109083	109093	109079	109079	You	2516	” said Henriette . Professor Fortescue held that woman 's “
109095	109119	109061	109061	I	0	” had done as much harm in the world as men 's badness . The one was merely the obverse of the other . “
109125	109142	109061	109061	I	0	” cried Lady Engleton . The Professor reminded her that truth was always stranger than fiction . “
109148	109152	109153	109153	women	606	” observed Valeria , “
109168	109181	109165	109165	their	606	” Professor Theobald had noted the same trait in other subject races . “
109192	109197	109188	109190	a subject race	2520	” remonstrated Lady Engleton . “
109205	109209	109188	109190	a subject race	2520	” cried Hadria , “
109216	109217	109188	109190	a subject race	2520	” “
109225	109226	109222	109223	Mrs. Temperley	154	” “

109294	109298	109299	109299	I	0	” demanded Valeria . “
109325	109326	109327	109327	I	0	” “
109332	109336	109327	109327	I	0	” Valeria offered . “
109348	109352	109327	109327	I	0	” said Hadria . “
109417	109426	109464	109464	you	2531	” Hadria 's eyes sparkled with suppressed excitement . “
109437	109442	109443	109443	you	2529	” said Professor Fortescue ; “
109460	109461	109443	109443	you	2529	” “
109472	109481	109464	109464	you	2531	” enquired Miss Du Prel , half resentfully . “
109531	109532	109533	109533	You	2531	” “
109549	109554	109533	109533	You	2531	” said Lady Engleton . “
109567	109568	109597	109598	a woman	3753	” “
109572	109573	109597	109598	a woman	3753	” “
109583	109588	109597	109598	a woman	3753	” Hadria put in . “
109619	109620	109621	109623	The adorable creature	2537	” “

109852	109859	109840	109840	her	2537	” Henriette uttered a little cry . “
109867	109881	109840	109840	her	2537	” Hadria added . Professor Theobald was chuckling gleefully . Lady Engleton laughed . “

Lady Engleton had risen laughing , and proposed a stroll to Hadria . Henriette , who did not like the tone the conversation was taking , desired to join them . “
110288	110293	110286	110286	Hadria	211	” said Lady Engleton . “

110575	110581	110582	110582	You	2568	” Lady Engleton laughed again . “

111527	111630	111396	111396	You	0	” Back flew iterative telegraph posts with Herculean swing , into the Past , looped together in rhythmic movement , marking the pulses of old Time . On , with rack and roar , into the mysterious Future . One could sit at the window and watch the machinery of Time 's foundry at work ; the hammers of his forge beating , beating , the wild sparks flying , the din and chaos whirling round one 's bewildered brain;—Past becoming Present , Present melting into Future , before one 's eyes . To sit and watch the whirring wheels ; to think “
111647	113265	113266	113266	I	0	me”—ye Gods , it is not to be realized ! The wonder of the flying land — England , England with her gentle homesteads , her people of the gentle voices ; and the unknown wonder of that other land , soon to change its exquisite dream - features for the still more thrilling , appealing marvel of reality — could it all be true ? Was this the response of the genius of the ring , the magic ring that we call will ? And would the complaisant genius always appear and obey one 's behests , in this strange fashion ? Thoughts ran on rhythmically , in the steady , flashing movement through verdant England . The Real ! that was the truly exquisite , the truly great , the true realm of the imagination ! What imagination was ever born to conceive or compass it ? A rattle under a bridge , a roar through a tunnel , and on again , through Kentish orchards . A time of blossoming . Disjointed , delicious impressions followed one another in swift succession , often superficially incoherent , but threaded deep , in the stirred consciousness , on a silver cord:—the unity of the creation was as obvious as its multiplicity . Images of the Past joined hands with visions of the Future . In these sweet green meadows , men had toiled , as thralls , but a few lifetimes ago , and they had gathered together , as Englishmen do , first to protest and reasonably demand , and then to buy their freedom with their lives . Their country - woman sent a message of thanksgiving , backward through the centuries , to these stout champions of the land 's best heritage , and breathed an aspiration to be worthy of the kinship that she claimed . The rattle and roar grew into a symphony — full , rich , magnificent , and then , with a rush , came a stirring musical conception : it seized the imagination . Oh , why were they stopping ? It was a little country station , but many passengers were on the platform . A careworn looking woman and a little girl entered the carriage , and the little girl fixed her eyes on her fellow - traveller with singular persistence . Then the more practical features of the occasion came into view , and all had an enthralling quality of reality — poetry . The sound of the waiting engine breathing out its white smoke into the brilliant air , the powerful creature quiescent but ready , with the turn of a handle , to put forth its slumbering might ; the crunching of footsteps on the gravel , the wallflowers and lilacs in the little station garden , the blue of the sky , and ah ! the sweetness of the air when one leant out to look along the interminable straight line of rails , leading — whither ? Even the very details of one 's travelling gear : the tweed gown meet for service , the rug and friendly umbrella , added to the feeling of overflowing satisfaction . The little girl stared more fixedly than ever . A smile and the offer of a flower made her look down , for a minute , but the gaze was resumed . Wherefore ? Was the inward tumult too evident in the face ? Well , no matter . The world was beautiful and wide ! The patient monster began to move again , with a gay whistle , as if he enjoyed this chase across country , on the track of Time . He was soon at full speed again , on his futile race : a hapless idealist in pursuit of lost dreams . The little girl watched the dawn of a smile on the face of the kind , pretty lady who had given her the flower . A locomotive figuring as an idealist ! Where would one 's fancy lead one to next ? Ah the sea ! heaving busily , and flashing under the morning radiance . Would they have a good crossing ? The wind was fresh . How dreamy and bright and windy the country looked , and how salt was the sea - breeze ! Very soon they would arrive at Folkestone . Rugs and umbrellas and hand - bags must be collected . The simple , solid commonplace of it all , touched some wholesome spring of delight . What a speed the train was going at ! One could scarcely stand in the jolting carriage . Old Time must not make too sure of his victory . One felt a wistful partisanship for his snorting rival , striving for ever to accomplish the impossible . The labouring visionary was not without significance to aspiring mortals . The outskirts of the town were coming in sight ; grey houses bleakly climbing chalky heights . It would be well to put on a thick overcoat at once . It was certain to be cold in the Channel . Luckily Hannah had a head on her shoulders , and could be trusted to follow the directions that had been given her . The last five minutes seemed interminable , but they did come to an end . There was an impression of sweet salt air , of wind and voices , of a hurrying crowd ; occasionally a French sentence pronounced by one of the officials , reminiscent of a thousand dreams and sights of foreign lands ; and then the breezy quay and waiting steamboat . The sound of that quiet , purposeful hiss of the steam sent a thrill along the nerves . Hannah and her charge were safely on board ; the small luggage followed , and lastly Hadria traversed the narrow bridge , wondering when the moment would arrive for waking up and finding herself in her little bedroom at Craddock Dene ? What was she thinking of ? Dream ? This was no dream , this bold , blue , dancing water , this living sunshine , this salt and savour and movement and brilliancy ! The other was the dream ; it seemed to be drifting away already . The picture of the village and the house and the meadows , and the low line of the hills was recalled as through a veil ; it would not stand up and face the emphatic present . At the end of a few months , would there be anything left of her connexion with the place where she had passed six — seven years of her life ? and such years ! They had put scars on her soul , as deep and ghastly as ever red - hot irons had marked on tortured flesh . Perhaps it was because of this rabid agony undergone , that now she seemed to have scarcely any clinging to her home,—for the present at any rate . And she knew that she left only sorrow for conventional disasters behind her . The joy of freedom and its intoxication drowned every other feeling . It was sheer relief to be away , to stretch oneself in mental liberty and leisure , to look round at earth and sky and the hurrying crowds , in quiet enjoyment ; to possess one 's days , one 's existence for the first time , in all these long years ! It was as the home - coming of a dispossessed heir . This freedom did not strike her as strange , but as obvious , as familiar . It was the first condition of a life that was worth living . And yet never before had she known it . Ernest and Fred and even Austin had enjoyed it from boyhood , and in far greater completeness than she could ever hope to possess it , even now . Yet even this limited , this comparative freedom , which a man could afford to smile at , was intoxicating . Heavens ! under what a leaden cloud of little obligations and restraints , and loneliness and pain , she had been living ! And for what purpose ? To make obeisance to a phantom public , not because she cared one iota for the phantom or its opinions , but because husband and parents and relations were terrified at the prospect of a few critical and disapproving remarks , that they would not even hear ! How mad it all was ! It was not true feeling , not affection , that prompted Hubert 's opposition ; it was not care for his real happiness that inspired Henriette with such ardour in this cause ; they would both be infinitely happier and more harmonious in Hadria 's absence . The whole source of their distress was the fear of what people would say when the separation became known to the world . That was the beginning and the end of the matter . Why could not the stupid old world mind its own business , in heaven 's name ? Good people , especially good women of the old type , would all counsel the imbecile sacrifice . They would all condemn this step . Indeed , the sacrifice that Hadria had refused to make , was so common , so much a matter of course , that her refusal appeared startling and preposterous : scarcely less astonishing than if a neighbour at dinner , requesting one to pass the salt , had been met with a rude “
113270	113271	113266	113266	I	0	” “
113290	113352	113266	113266	I	0	” she reflected . There was a tramping of passengers up and down the deck . People walked obliquely , with head to windward . Draperies fluttered ; complexions verged towards blue . Only two ladies who had abandoned hope from the beginning , suffered from the crossing . The kindly sailors occupied their leisure in bringing tarpaulins to the distressed . “
113363	113385	113359	113359	you	212	” Hannah looked forward ardently to the end of the journey , but her charge seemed delighted with the new scene . “
113396	113416	113387	113387	you	212	” Hannah asked , perhaps noticing the sparkle of her employer 's eye and the ring in her voice . “
113450	113451	113444	113444	we	2599	” “
113458	113462	113444	113444	we	2599	” said Hannah . “
113472	113473	113465	113465	you	212	” “
113483	113811	113474	113474	They	2601	” replied Mrs. Temperley . A strange fierce light passed through her eyes for a second , but Hannah did not notice it . Martha 's shawl was blowing straight into her eyes , and the nurse was engaged in arranging it more comfortably . The coast of France had become clear , some time ago ; they were making the passage very quickly to - day . Soon the red roofs of Boulogne were to be distinguished , with the grey dome of the cathedral on the hill - top . Presently , the boat had arrived in the bright old town , and every detail of outline and colour was standing forth brilliantly , as if the whole scene had been just washed over with clear water and all the tints were wet . The first impression was keen . The innumerable differences from English forms and English tones sprang to the eye . A whiff of foreign smell and a sound of foreign speech reached the passengers at about the same moment . The very houses looked unfamiliarly built , and even the letters of printed names of hotels and shops had a frivolous , spindly appearance — elegant but frail . The air was different from English air . Some bouillon and a slice of fowl were very acceptable at the restaurant at the station , after the business of examining the luggage was over . Hannah , evidently nourishing a sense of injury against the natives for their eccentric jargon , and against the universe for the rush and discomfort of the last quarter of an hour , was disposed to express her feelings by a marked lack of relish for her food . She regarded Hadria 's hearty appetite with a disdainful expression . Martha ate bread and butter and fruit . She was to have some milk that had been brought for her , when they were en route again . “
113818	114091	113474	113474	They	2601	” Within five minutes , the train was puffing across the wastes of blowing sand that ran along the coast , beyond the town . The child , who had become accustomed to the noise and movement , behaved better than had been expected . She seemed to take pleasure in looking out of the window at the passing trees . Hannah was much struck with this sign of awakening intelligence . It was more than the good nurse showed herself . She scarcely condescended to glance at the panorama of French fields , French hills and streams that were rushing by . How pale and ethereal they were , these Gallic coppices and woodlands ! And with what a dainty lightness the foliage spread itself to the sun , French to its graceful finger - tips ! That grey old house , with high lichen - stained roof and narrow windows — where but in sunny France could one see its like?—and the little farmsteads and villages , full of indescribable charm . One felt oneself in a land of artists . There was no inharmonious , no unfitting thing anywhere . Man had wedded himself to Nature , and his works seemed to receive her seal and benediction . English landscape was beautiful , and it had a particular charm to be found nowhere else in the world ; but in revenge , there was something here that England could not boast . Was it fanciful to see in the characteristics of vegetation and scenery , the origin or expression of the difference of the two races at their greatest ? “
114101	114306	114311	114311	them	2605	” They were passing some fields where , in the slanting rays of the sun , peasants in blue blouses and several women were bending over their toil . It was a subject often chosen by French artists . Hadria understood why . One of the labourers stood watching the train , and she let her eyes rest on the patient figure till she was carried beyond his little world . If she could have painted that scene just as she saw it , all the sadness and mystery of the human lot would have stood forth eloquently in form and colour ; these a magic harmony , not without some inner kinship with the spirit of man at its noblest . What was he thinking , that toil - bent peasant , as the train flashed by ? What tragedy or comedy was he playing on his rural stage ? Hadria sat down and shut her eyes , dazzled by the complex mystery and miracle of life , and almost horrified at the overwhelming thought of the millions of these obscure human lives burning themselves out , everywhere , at every instant , like so many altar - candles to the unknown God ! “
114389	115007	114382	114382	his	2607	” It was nearly eight o'clock when the train plunged among the myriad lights of the great city . The brilliant beacon of the Eiffel Tower sat high up in the sky , like an exile star . Gaunt and grim was the vast station , with its freezing purplish electric light . Yet even here , to Hadria 's stirred imagination , there was a certain quality in the Titanic building , which removed it from the vulgarity of English utilitarian efforts of the same order . In a fanciful mood , one might imagine a tenth circle of the Inferno , wherein those stern grey arches should loftily rise , in blind and endless sequence , limbing an abode of horror , a place of punishment for those , empty - hearted , who had lived without colour and sunshine , in voluntary abnegation , caring only for gain and success . The long delay in the examination of the luggage , the fatigue of the journey , tended to increase the disposition to regard the echoing edifice , with its cold hollow reverberations , as a Circle of the Doomed . It was as if they passed from the realm of the Shades through the Gates of Life , when at length the cab rattled out of the courtyard of the station , and turned leftwards into the brilliant streets of Paris . It was hard to realize that all this stir and light and life had been going on night after night , for all these years , during which one had sat in the quiet drawing - room at Craddock Dene , trying wistfully , hopelessly , to grasp the solid fact of an unknown vast reality , through a record here and there . The journey was a long one to the Rue Boissy d'Anglas , but tired as she was , Hadria did not wish it shorter . Even Hannah was interested in the brilliantly lighted shops and cafés and the splendour of the boulevards . Now and again , the dark deserted form of a church loomed out , lonely , amidst the gaiety of Parisian street - life . Some electric lamp threw a distant gleam upon calm classic pillars , which seemed to hold aloof , with a quality of reserve rarely to be noticed in things Parisian . Hadria greeted it with a feeling of gratitude . The great Boulevard was ablaze and swarming with life . The cafés were full ; the gilt and mirrors and the crowds of consommateurs within , all visible as one passed along the street , while , under the awning outside , crowds were sitting smoking , drinking , reading the papers . Was it really possible that only this morning , those quiet English fields had been dozing round one , those sleepy villagers spreading their slow words out , in expressing an absence of idea , over the space of time in which a Parisian conveyed a pocket philosophy ? The cabman directed his vehicle down the Rue Royale , passing the stately Madeleine , with its guardian sycamores , and out into the windy spaciousness of the Place de la Concorde . A wondrous city ! Hannah pointed out the electric light of the Eiffel Tower to her charge , and Martha put out her small hands , demanding the toy on the spot . The festooned lights of the Champs Elysées swung themselves up , in narrowing line , till they reached the pompous arch at the summit , and among the rich trees of those Elysian fields gleamed the festive lamps of cafés chantants . “
115015	115277	114382	114382	his	2607	” The neat maid , in picturesque white cap and apron , stood with her hand on the door of the little bedroom , on one of the highest storeys of the pension . Half of one of the long windows had been set open , and the sounds of the rolling of vehicles over the smooth asphalte , mingled with those of voices , were coming up , straight and importunate , into the dainty bedroom . The very sounds seemed nearer and clearer in this keen - edged land . The bed stood in one corner , canopied with white and blue ; a thick carpet gave a sense of luxury and deadened the tramp of footsteps ; a marble mantel - piece was surmounted by a mirror , and supported a handsome bronze clock and two bronze ornaments . The furniture was of solid mahogany . A nameless French odour pervaded the atmosphere , delicate , subtle , but unmistakeable . And out of the open window , one could see a series of other lighted windows , all of exactly the same tall graceful design , opening in the middle by the same device and the same metal handle that had to be turned in order to open or close the window . Within , the rooms obviously modelled themselves on the one unvarying ideal . A few figures could be seen coming and going , busy at work or play . Above the steep roofs , a blue - black sky was alive with brilliant stars . “
115280	115700	114382	114382	his	2607	” Madame required nothing more . JUST at first , it was a sheer impossibility to do anything but bask and bathe in the sunny present , to spend the days in wandering incredulously through vernal Paris , over whose bursting freshness and brilliancy the white clouds seemed to be driven , with the same joy of life . The city was crammed ; the inhabitants poured forth in swarms to enjoy , in true French fashion , the genial warmth and the universal awakening after the long capricious winter . It was actually hot in the sun , and fresh light clothing became a luxury , like a bath after a journey . The year had raised its siege , and there was sudden amity between man and Nature . Shrivelled man could relax the tension of resistance to cold and damp and change , and go forth into the sun with cordial insouciance . In many of the faces might be read this kindly amnesty , although there were some so set and fixed with past cares that not even the soft hand of a Parisian spring could smooth away the lines , or even touch the spirit . These Hadria passed with an aching pity . Circumstance had been to them a relentless taskmaster . Perhaps they had not rubbed the magic ring of will , and summoned the obedient genius . Perhaps circumstance had forbidden them even the rag wherewith to rub — or the impulse . Sallying forth from the pension , Hadria would sometimes pause , for a moment , at the corner of the street , where it opened into the Place de la Concorde , irresolute , because of the endless variety of possible ways to turn , and places to visit . She seldom made definite plans the day before , unless it were for the pleasure of changing them . The letter of introduction to Madame Vauchelet had remained unpresented . The sense of solitude , combined for the first time with that of freedom , was too delightful to forego . One must have time to realize and appreciate the sudden calm and serenity ; the sudden absence of claims and obstructions and harassing criticisms . Heavens , what a price people consented to pay for the privilege of human ties ! what hard bargains were driven in the kingdom of the affections ! Thieves , extortionists , usurers — and in the name of all the virtues ! “
115707	115777	114382	114382	his	2607	” Hadria inwardly exclaimed , as she stood watching the coming and going of people , the spouting of fountains , the fluttering of big sycamore leaves in the Champs Elysées . Unhappily , the solitude made difficulties . But meanwhile there was a large field to be explored , where these difficulties did not arise , or could be guarded against . Her sex was a troublesome obstruction . “
115791	116081	116082	116082	One	329	” she wrote to Algitha . Society bristled with insults , conscious and unconscious . Nor had one lived the brightest , sweetest years of one 's life tethered and impounded , without feeling the consequences when the tether was cut . There were dreads , shrinkings , bewilderments , confusions to encounter ; the difficulties of pilotage in unknown seas , of self - knowledge , and guidance suddenly needed in new ranges of the soul ; fresh temptations , fresh possibilities to deal with ; everything untested , the alphabet of worldly experience yet to learn . But all this was felt with infinitely greater force a little later , when the period of solitude was over , and Hadria found herself in the midst of a little society whose real codes and ideas she had gropingly to learn . Unfamiliar ( in any practical sense ) with life , even in her own country , she had no landmarks or finger - posts , of any kind , in this new land . Her sentiment had never been narrowly British , but now she realized her nationality over - keenly ; she felt herself almost grotesquely English , and had a sense of insular clumsiness amidst a uprightly , dexterous people . Conscious of a thousand illusive , but very real differences in point of view , and in nature , between the two nations , she had a baffled impression of walking among mysteries and novelties that she could not grasp . She began to be painfully conscious of the effects of the narrow life that she had led , and of the limitations that had crippled her in a thousand ways hitherto scarcely realized . “
116090	116096	116082	116082	One	329	” she wrote to Algitha . “
116399	116727	116734	116734	men	3698	” Having been , from childhood , more or less at issue with her surroundings , Hadria had never fully realized their power upon her personality . But now daily a fresh recognition of her continued imprisonment , baffled her attempt to look at things with clear eyes . She struggled to get round and beyond that past - fashioned self , not merely in order to see truly , but in order to see at all . And in doing so , she ran the risk of letting go what she might have done better to hold . She felt painfully different from these people among whom she found herself . Her very trick of pondering over things sent her spinning to hopeless distances . They seemed to ponder so wholesomely little . Their intelligence was devoted to matters of the moment ; they were keen and well - finished and accomplished . Hadria used to look at them in astonishment . How did these quick - witted people manage to escape the importunate inquisitive demon , the familiar spirit , who pursued her incessantly with his queries and suggestions ? He would stare up from river and street and merry gardens ; his haunting eyes looked mockingly out of green realms of stirring foliage , and his voice was like a sardonic echo to the happy voices of the children , laughing at their play under the flickering shadows , of mothers discussing their cares and interests , of men in blouses , at work by the water - side , or solemn , in frock - coats , with pre - occupations of business and bread - winning . The demon had his own reflections on all these seemingly ordinary matters , and so bizarre were they at times , so startling and often so terrible , that one found oneself shivering in full noontide , or smiling , or thrilled with passionate pity at “
116736	117955	116734	116734	men	3698	” It was sweet to stretch one 's cramped wings to the sun , to ruffle and spread them , as a released bird will , but it was startling to find already little stiff habits arisen , little creaks and hindrances never suspected , that made flight in the high air not quite effortless and serene . The Past is never past ; immortal as the Gods , it lives enthroned in the Present , and sets its limits and lays its commands . Cases have been known of a man blind from birth being restored to sight , at mature age . For a time , the appearance of objects was strange and incomprehensible . Their full meaning was not conveyed to him ; they remained riddles . He could not judge the difference between near and far , between solid and liquid ; he had no experience , dating from childhood , of the apparent smallness of distant things , of the connexion between the impression given to the touch by solids and their effect on the eye . He had all these things to learn . A thousand trifling associations , of which those with normal senses are scarcely conscious , had to be stumblingly acquired , as a child learns to connect sound and sight , in learning to read . Such were the changes of consciousness that Hadria found herself going through ; only realising each phase of the process after it was over , and the previous confusion of vision had been itself revealed , by the newly and often painfully acquired coordinating skill . But , as generally happens , in the course of passing from ignorance to knowledge , the intermediate stage was chaotic . Objects loomed up large and indistinct , as through a mist ; vague forms drifted by , half revealed , to melt away again ; here and there were clear outlines and solid impressions , to be deemed trustworthy and given a place of honour ; thence a disproportion in the general conception ; it being almost beyond human power to allow sufficiently for that which is unknown . For some time , however , the dominant impression on Hadria 's mind was of her own gigantic ignorance . This ignorance was far more confusing and even misleading than it had been when its proportions were less defined . The faint twinkle of light revealed the dusky outline , bewildering and discouraging the imagination . Intuitive knowledge was disturbed by the incursion of scraps of disconnected experience . This condition of mind made her an almost insoluble pyschological problem . Since she was evidently a woman of pronounced character , her bewilderment and tentitive attitude were not allowed for . Her actions were regarded as deliberate and cool - headed , when often they would be the outcome of sheer confusion , or chance , or perhaps of a groping experimental effort . The first three weeks in Paris had been given up to enjoying the new conditions of existence . But now practical matters claimed consideration . The pension in the Rue Boissy d'Anglas was not suitable as a permanent abode . Rooms must be looked for , combining cheapness with a good situation , within easy distance of the scene of Hadria 's future musical studies , and also within reach of some park or gardens for Martha 's benefit . This ideal place of abode was at last found . It cost rather more than Hadria had wished to spend on mere lodging , but otherwise it seemed perfect . It was in a quiet street between the Champs Elysées and the river . Two great thoroughfares ran , at a respectful distance , on either side , with omnibuses always passing . Hadria could be set down within a few minutes ' walk of the School of Music , or , if she liked to give the time , could walk the whole way to her morning 's work , through some of the most charming parts of Paris . As for Martha , she was richly provided with playgrounds . The Bois could be quickly reached , and there were always the Champs Elysées or the walk beneath the chestnuts by the river , along the Cours de la Reine and the length of the quays . Even Hannah thought the situation might do . Hadria had begun her studies at the School of Music , and found the steady work not only a profound , though somewhat stern enjoyment , but a solid backbone to her new existence , giving it cohesion and form . Recreation deserved its name , after work of this kind . Any lurking danger of too great speculative restlessness disappeared . There had been a moment when the luxurious joy of mere wandering observation and absorption , threatened to become overwhelming , and to loosen some of the rivets of the character . But work was to the sum - total of impulse what the central weight was to one of Martha 's toys : a leaden ballast that always brought the balance right again , however wildly the little tyrant might swing the creature off the perpendicular . When Hadria used to come in , pleasantly tired with her morning 's occupation , and the wholesome heat of the sun , to take her simple déjeuner in the little apartment with Martha , a frivolous five minutes would often be spent by the two in endeavouring to overcome the rigid principles of that well - balanced plaything . But always the dead weight at its heart frustrated their attempts . Martha played the most inconsiderate pranks with its centre of gravity , but quite in vain . When a little French boy from the étage above was allowed to come and play with Martha , she proceeded to experiment upon his centre of gravity in the same way , and seemed much surprised when Jean Paul Auguste not only howled indignantly , but did n't swing up again after he was over - turned . He remained supine , and had to be reinstated by Hadria and Hannah , and comforted with sweetmeats . Martha 's logic received one of its first checks . She evidently made up her mind that logic was a fallacious mode of inference , and determined to abandon it for the future . These rebuffs in infancy , Hadria conjectured , might account for much ! About three weeks passed in almost pure enjoyment and peace ; and then it was discovered that the cost of living , in spite of an extremely simple diet , was such as might have provided epicurean luxuries for a family of ten . Hadria 's enquiries among her acquaintances elicited cries of consternation . Obviously the landlady , who did the marketing , must be cheating on a royal scale , and there was nothing for it but to move . Hadria suggested to Madame Vauchelet , whose advice she always sought in practical matters , that perhaps the landlady might be induced to pursue her lucrative art in moderation ; could she not put it honestly down in the bill “
117963	117969	116734	116734	men	3698	” Madame Vauchlelet was horrified . “
117972	119456	116734	116734	men	3698	” she cried ; one must seek another apartment . If only Hannah understood French and could do the marketing herself . But Hannah scorned the outlandish lingo , and had a poor opinion of the nation as a whole . It was fatiguing and somewhat discouraging work to begin , all over again , the quest of rooms , especially with the difficulty about the landlady always in view , and no means of ascertaining her scale of absorption . It really seemed a pity that it could not be mentioned as an extra , like coal and lights . Then one would know what one was about . This uncertain liability , with an extremely limited income , which was likely to prove insufficient unless some addition could be made to it , was trying to the nerves . In order to avoid too great anxiety , Hadria had to make up her mind to a less attractive suite of rooms , farther out of town , and she found it desirable to order many of the comestibles herself . Madame Vauchelet was untiring in her efforts to help and advise . She initiated Hadria into the picturesque mysteries of Parisian housekeeping . It was amusing to go to the shops and markets with this shrewd Frenchwoman , and very enlightening as to the method of living cheaply and well . Hadria began to think wistfully of a more permanent ménage in this entrancing capital , where there were still worlds within worlds to explore . She questioned Madame Vauchlelet as to the probable cost of a femme de ménage . Madame quickly ran through some calculations and pronounced a sum alluringly small . Since the landlady difficulty was so serious , and made personal superintendence necessary , it seemed as if one might as well have the greater comfort and independence of this more home - like arrangement . Madame Vauchelet recommended an excellent woman who would cook and market , and , with Hannah 's help , easily do all that was necessary . After many calculations and consultations with Madame Vauchelet , Hadria finally decided to rent , for three months , a cheerful little suite of rooms near the Arc de Triomphe . Madame Vauchelet drank a cup of tea in the little salon , with quiet heroism , not liking to refuse Hadria 's offer of the friendly beverage . But she wondered at the powerful physique of the nation that could submit to the trial daily . Hadria was brimming over with pleasure in her new home , which breathed Paris from every pore . She had already surrounded herself with odds and ends of her own , with books and a few flowers . If only this venture turned out well , how delightful would be the next few months . Hadria did not clearly look beyond that time . To her , it seemed like a century . Her only idea as to the farther future was an abstract resolve to let nothing short of absolute compulsion persuade her to renounce her freedom , or subject herself to conditions that made the pursuit of her art impossible . How to carry out the resolve , in fact and detail , was a matter to consider when the time came . If one were to consider future difficulties as well as deal with immediate ones , into what crannies and interstices were the affairs of the moment to be crammed ? There has probably never been a human experience of even a few months of perfect happiness , of perfect satisfaction with conditions , even among the few men and women who know how to appreciate the bounty of Fate , when she is generous , and to take the sting out of minor annoyances by treating them lightly . Hadria was ready to shrug her shoulders at legions of these , so long as the main current of her purpose were not diverted . But she could not steel herself against the letters that she received from England . Everyone was deeply injured but bravely bearing up . Her family was a stricken and sorrowing family . Being naturally heroic , it said little but thought the more . Relations whose names Hadria scarcely remembered , seemed to have waked up at the news of her departure and claimed their share of the woe . Obscure Temperleys raised astounded heads and mourned . Henriette wrote that she was really annoyed at the way in which everybody was talking about Hadria 's conduct . It was most uncomfortable . She hoped Hadria was able to be happy . Hubert was ready to forgive her and to receive her back , in spite of everything . Henriette entreated her to return ; for her own sake , for Hubert 's sake , for the children 's . They were just going off to school , poor little boys . Henriette , although so happy at the Red House , was terribly grieved at this sad misunderstanding . It seemed so strange , so distressing . Henriette had thoroughly enjoyed looking after dear Hubert and the sweet children . They were in splendid health . She had been very particular about hygiene . Hubert and she had seen a good deal of the Engletons lately . How charming Lady Engleton was ! So much tact . She was advanced in her ideas , only she never allowed them to be intrusive . She seemed just like everybody else . She hated to make herself conspicuous ; the very ideal of a true lady , if one might use the much - abused word . Professor Fortescue was reported to be still far from well . Professor Theobald had not taken the Priory after all . It was too large . It looked so deserted and melancholy now . Henriette always finished her letters with an entreaty to Hadria to return . People were talking so . They suspected the truth ; although , of course , one had hoped that the separation would be supposed to be temporary — as indeed Henriette trusted it would prove . Madame Bertaux , who had just returned from England to her beloved Paris , reported to Hadria , when she called on the latter in her new abode , that everyone was talking about the affair with as much eagerness as if the fate of the empire had depended on it . Madame Bertaux recommended indifference and silence . She observed , in her sharp , good - natured , impatient way , that reforming confirmed drunkards , converting the heathen , making saints out of sinners , or a silk purse out of a sow 's ear , would be mere child 's play compared with the task of teaching the average idiot to mind his own business . THE new ménage went well . Therèse was a treasure , and Martha 's willing slave . Expenses were kept fairly reasonable by her care and knowledge . Still it must not be forgotten that the little income needed supplementing . Hadria had been aware of this risk from the first , but had faced it , regarding it as the less perilous of the alternatives that she had to choose between . The income was small , but it was her own absolutely , and she must live on that , with such auxiliary sums as she could earn . She hoped to be able to make a little money by her compositions . The future was all vague and unknown , but one thing was at least certain : it cost money to live , and in some way or other it had to be made . She told her kind friend , Madame Vauchelet , of her plan . Madame Vauchelet consulted her musical friends . People were sympathetic , but rather vague in their advice . It was always difficult , this affair . The beginning was hard . M. Thillard , a kindly , highly - cultivated man of about sixty , who had heard Hadria play , took great interest in her talent , and busied himself on her behalf . He said he would like to interest the great Jouffroy in this work . It had so distinct and remarkable an individuality that Dr. Thillard was sure Jouffroy would be enchanted with it . For himself , he held that it shewed a development of musical form and expression extremely remarkable . He could not quite understand it . There was , he knew not what , in it , of strange and powerful ; a music of the North ; something of bizarre , something of mysterious , even of terrible , “
119461	119477	116734	116734	men	3698	” cried Mr. Thillard , working himself to a climax as the theme inspired him , “
119489	119528	116734	116734	men	3698	” Madame Vauchelet nodded gravely at this pronouncement . It ought to be published , she said . But this supreme recompense of genius was apparently hard to achieve . The score was sent from publisher to publisher : “
119534	119538	116734	116734	men	3698	” said Hadria , “
119556	119601	119602	119602	One	329	” But at the end of a long and wearisome delay , the little packet was returned in a tattered condition to its discouraged author . M. Thillard made light of this . It was always thus at first . One must have patience . “
119606	119610	119602	119602	One	329	” said Hadria , “
119626	119627	116734	116734	men	3698	” “
119632	119637	116734	116734	men	3698	” said M. Thillard . “
119642	120116	116734	116734	men	3698	” On one sunny afternoon , when Hadria had returned , thrilled and inspired by a magnificent orchestral performance at the Châtelet , she found Madame Vauchelet , M. Thillard , and the great Jouffroy waiting in her salon . Jouffroy was small , eccentric , fiery , with keen eager eyes , thick black hair , and overhanging brows , M. Thillard reminded Madame Temperley of her kind permission to present to her M. Jouffroy . Madame Temperley was charmed and flattered by Monsieur 's visit . It was an exciting afternoon . Madame Vauchelet was eager to hear the opinion of the great man , and anxious for Hadria to make a good impression . The warm - hearted Frenchwoman , who had lost a daughter , of whom Hadria reminded her , had been untiring in her kindness , from the first . Madame Vauchelet , in her young days , had cherished a similar musical ambition , and Jouffroy always asserted that she might have done great things , as a performer , had not the cares of a family put an end to all hope of bringing her gifts to fruition . The piano was opened . Jouffroy played . Madame Vauchelet , with her large veil thrown back , her black cashmere folds falling around her , sat in the large arm - chair , a dignified and graceful figure , listening gravely . The kindly , refined face of M. Thillard beamed with enjoyment ; an occasional cry of admiration escaping his lips , at some exquisite touch from the master . The time slipped by , with bewildering rapidity . Monsieur Thillard asked if they might be allowed to hear some of Madame 's compositions — those which she had already been so amiable as to play to him . Jouffroy settled himself to listen ; his shaggy eyebrows lowering over his eyes , not in severity but in fixity of attention . Hadria trembled for a moment , as her hands touched the keys . Jouffroy gave a nod of satisfaction . If there had been no such quiver of nerves he would have doubted . So he said afterwards to Mr. Thillard and Madame Vauchelet . After listening , for a time , without moving a muscle , he suddenly sat bolt upright and looked round at the player . The character of the music , always individual , had grown more marked , and at this point an effect was produced which appeared to startle the musician . He withdrew his gaze , after a moment , muttering something to himself , and resumed his former attitude , slowly and gravely nodding his head . There was a long silence after the last of the lingering , questioning notes had died away . “
120129	120147	120118	120118	Madame	232	” The answer was affirmative . She was only too glad to have the chance to work . “
120153	120154	120149	120149	Madame	232	” “
120161	120162	120149	120149	Madame	232	” “
120215	120224	120304	120305	Mon Dieu	205	” The colour rushed into Hadria 's cheeks . “
120227	120238	120304	120305	Mon Dieu	205	” exclaimed Madame Vauchelet . M. Thillard beamed with satisfaction . “
120245	120256	120240	120240	I	0	” Jouffroy clapped his friend on the back with enthusiasm . “
120261	120265	120240	120240	I	0	” he said , “
120269	120303	120304	120305	Mon Dieu	205	” He questioned Hadria minutely as to her course of study , approved it on the whole , suggesting alterations and additions . He asked to look through some more of her work . “
120307	120321	120304	120305	Mon Dieu	205	” he ejaculated , as his quick eye ran over page after page . “
120347	120354	120333	120333	her	232	” He looked at her searchingly . “
120359	120364	120365	120365	Madame	2631	” exclaimed M. Thillard . “
120371	120372	120365	120365	Madame	2631	” “
120375	120388	120365	120365	Madame	2631	” cried Jouffroy , with a shake of his black shaggy head , “
120401	120402	120403	120403	I	0	” “
120407	120887	120403	120403	I	0	” cried Hadria at last , in a voice that seemed to her to come from somewhere a long way off . The whole scene had acquired the character of a dream . The figures moved through miles of clear distance . Her impressions were chaotic . While a strange , deep confirmation of the musician 's words , seemed to stir within her as if they had long been familiar , her mind entirely refused credence . He had gone too far . Had he said a remarkable talent , but — Yet was it not , after all , possible ? Nature scattered her gifts wildly and cruelly : cruelly , because she cared not into what cramped nooks and crannies she poured her maddening explosive : cruelly , because she hurled this fire from heaven with indiscriminate hand , to set alight one dared not guess how many chained martyrs at their stakes . Nature did not pick and choose the subjects of her wilful ministrations . She seemed to scatter at random , out of sheer gaieté de coeur , as Jouffroy had said , and if some golden grain chanced to be gleaming in this soul or that , what cause for astonishment ? The rest might be the worst of dross . As well might the chance occur to one of Nature 's children as to another . She did not bestow even one golden grain for nothing , bien sûr ; she meant to be paid back with interest . Just one bright bead of the whole vast circlet of the truth : perhaps it was hers , but more likely that these kind friends had been misled by their sympathy . M. Jouffroy came next day to have a long talk with Hadria about her work and her methods . He was absolutely confident of what he had said , but he was emphatic regarding the necessity for work ; steady , uninterrupted work . Everything must be subservient to the one aim . If she contemplated anything short of complete dedication to her art — well ( he shrugged his shoulders ) , it would be better to amuse herself . There could be no half - measures with art . True , there were thousands of people who practised a little of this and a little of that , but Art would endure no such disrespect . It was the affair of a lifetime . He had known many women with great talent , but , alas ! they had not persistence . Only last year a charming , beautiful young woman , with — mon Dieu!—a talent that might have placed her on the topmost rank of singers , had married against the fervent entreaties of Jouffroy , and now he shrugged his shoulders with a gesture of pitying contempt—“elle
120893	120906	120403	120403	I	0	” Her force had gone from herself into the plump infant , whose “
120909	121040	120403	120403	I	0	” were all that now remained to the world of his mother 's once magnificent voice . Hélas ! how many brilliant careers had he not seen ruined by this fatal instinct ! Jouffroy 's passion for his art had overcome the usual sentiment of the Frenchman , and even the strain of Jewish blood . He did not think a woman of genius well lost for a child . He grudged her to the fetish la famille . He went so far as to say that , even without the claims of genius , a woman ought to be permitted to please herself in the matter . When he heard that Madame had two children , and yet had not abandoned her ambition , he nodded gravely and significantly . “
121046	121050	121051	121051	She	232	” he commented . “
121058	121111	121112	121114	a stupid maternity	2632	” It was the first case of the kind that had come under his notice . He hoped much from it . His opinion of the sex would depend on Hadria 's power of persistence . In consequence of numberless pupils who had shewn great promise , and then had satisfied themselves with “
121116	121170	121112	121114	a stupid maternity	2632	” Jouffrey was inclined to regard women with contempt , not as regards their talent , which he declared was often astonishing , but as regards their persistency of character and purpose . One could not rely on them . They had enthusiasm — Oh , but enthusiasm à faire peur , but presently “
121177	121182	121112	121114	a stupid maternity	2632	” approaches , and then “
121189	121256	121112	121114	a stupid maternity	2632	” There was something of fatality in the affair . The instinct was terrible ; a demoniacal possession . It was for women a veritable curse , a disease . M. Jouffroy had pronounced views on the subject . He regarded the maternal instinct as the scourge of genius . It was , for women , the devil 's truncheon , his rod of empire . This “
121259	121309	121310	121310	I	0	” held them — in spite of all their fine intuitions and astonishing ability — after all on the animal plane ; cut them off from the little band of those who could break up new ground in human knowledge , and explore new heights of Art and Nature . “
121343	121857	121329	121329	I	0	” Hadria worked with sufficient energy to please even Jouffroy . Her heart was in it , and her progress rapid . Everything was organized , in her life , for the one object . At the School of Music , she was in an atmosphere of work , everyone being bent on the same goal , each detail arranged to further the students in their efforts . It was like walking on a pavement after struggling uphill on loose sand ; like breathing sea - breezes after inhaling a polluted atmosphere . In old days , Hadria used to be haunted by a singular recurrent nightmare : that she was toiling up a steep mountain made of hard slippery rock , the summit always receding as she advanced . Behind her was a vast precipice down which she must fall if she lost her footing ; and always , she saw hands without bodies attached to them placing stones in the path , so that they rolled down and had to be evaded at the peril of her life . And each time , after one set of stones was evaded , and she thought there would be a time of respite , another batch was set rolling , amid thin , scarcely audible laughter , which came on the storm - wind that blew precipice - wards across the mountain ; and invariably she awoke just as a final avalanche of cruel stones had sent her reeling over the hideous verge . One is disposed to make light of the sufferings gone through in a dream , though it would trouble most of us to explain why , since the agony of mind is often as extreme as possibly could be endured in actual life . From the day of her arrival in Paris , Hadria was never again tormented with this nightmare . Composition went on rapidly now . Soon there was a little pile of new work for M. Jouffroy 's inspection . He was delighted , criticizing severely , but always encouraging to fresh efforts . As for the publishing , that was a different matter . In spite of M. Jouffroy 's recommendation , publishers could not venture on anything of a character so unpopular . The music had merit , but it was eccentric . M. Jouffroy was angry . He declared that he would play something of Madame 's at the next Châtelet concert . There would be opposition , but he would carry his point . And he did . But the audience received it very coldly . Although Hadria had expected such a reception , she felt a chill run through her , and a sinking of the heart . It was like a cold word that rebuffs an offer of sympathy , or an appeal for it . It sent her back into depths of loneliness , and reminded her how cut off she was from the great majority of her fellows , after all . And then Guy de Maupassant 's dreadful “
121859	121961	121963	121963	they	2637	” came to her memory . There is no way ( the hero of the sketch asserts ) by which a man can break the eternal loneliness to which he is foredoomed . He can not convey to others his real impressions or emotion , try as he may . By a series of assertions , hard to deny , the hero arrives at a terrible conclusion amounting to this : Art , affection , are in vain ; we know not what we say , nor whom we love . Jouffroy came out of the theatre , snorting and ruffled . “
121969	121977	121963	121963	they	2637	” Hadria thought that perhaps she was the “
121979	122074	121329	121329	I	0	” ; it was a possibility to be counted with , but she dared not say so to the irate Jouffroy . He was particularly angry , because the audience had confirmed his own fear that only very slowly would the quality of the music be recognized by even the more cultivated public . It had invaded fresh territory , he said , added to the range of expression , and was meanwhile a new language to casual listeners . It was rebel music , offensive to the orthodox . Hubert had always said that “
122082	122091	121329	121329	I	0	” and he appeared to have been right . “
122101	123099	121329	121329	I	0	” exclaimed Jouffroy . If the work had been poorer , less original , there would not have been this trouble . Was there not some other method by which Madame could earn what was necessary , en attendant ? In one of Professor Fortescue 's letters , he had reminded Hadria of his eagerness to help her . Yet , what could he do ? He had influence in the world of science , but Hadria could not produce anything scientific ! She bethought her of trying to write light descriptive articles , of a kind depending not so much on literary skill as on subject and epistolary freshness of touch . These she sent to the Professor , not without reluctance , knowing how overburdened he already was with work and with applications for help and advice . He approved of her idea , and advised the articles being sent the round of the magazines and papers . Through his influence , one of the shorter articles was accepted , and Hadria felt encouraged . Her day was now very full . The new art was laborious , severely simple in character , though she studiously made her articles . Her acquaintances had multiplied very rapidly of late , and although this brought into her experience much that was pleasant and interesting , the demands of an enlarging circle swallowed an astonishing number of hours . An element of trouble had begun to come into the life that had been so full of serenity , as well as of regular and strenuous work . Hadria was already feeling the effects of anxiety and hurry . She had not come with untried powers to the fray . The reserve forces had long ago been sapped , in the early struggles , beginning in her girlhood and continuing at increasing pressure ever since . There was only enough nerve - force to enable one to live from hand to mouth . Expenditure of this force having been so often in excess of income , economy had become imperative . Yet , economy was difficult . M. Jouffroy was always spurring her to work , to throw over everything for this object ; letters from England incessantly urged a very different course ; friends in Paris pressed her to visit them , to accompany them hither and thither , to join musical parties , to compose little songs ( some bagatelle in celebration of a birthday or wedding ) , to drive to the further end of the town to play to this person or that who had heard of Madame 's great talent . Hadria was glad to do anything she could to express her gratitude for the kindness she had received on all hands , but , alas ! there were only a certain number of hours in the day , and only a certain number of years in one 's life , and art was long . Moreover , nerves were awkward things to play with . Insidiously , treacherously , difficulties crept up . Even here , where she seemed so free , the peculiar claims that are made , by common consent , on a woman 's time and strength began to weave their tiny cords around her . She took warning , and put an end to any voluntary increase of her circle , but the step had been taken a little too late . The mischief was done . To give pain or offence for the sake of an hour or two , more or less , seemed cruel and selfish , yet Hadria often longed for the privilege that every man enjoys , of quietly pursuing his work without giving either . A disastrous sense of hurry and fatigue began to oppress her . This was becoming serious . She must make a stand . Yet her attempts at explanation were generally taken as polite excuses for neglecting those who had been kind and cordial . Jouffroy taxed her with looking tired . One must not be tired . One must arrange the time so as to secure ample rest and recreation after the real work was over . Women were so foolish in that way . They did everything feverishly . They imagined themselves to have inexhaustible nerves . Hadria hinted that it was perhaps others who demanded of them what was possible only to inexhaustible nerves . True ; towards women , people behaved as idiots . How was it possible to produce one 's best , if repose were lacking ? Serenity was necessary for all production . As well expect water perpetually agitated to freeze , as expect the crystals of the mind to produce themselves under the influence of incessant disturbance . Work ? Yes . Work never harmed any man or woman . It was harassment that killed . Work of the mind , of the artistic powers , that was a tonic to the whole being . But little distractions , irregular duties , worries , uncertainties — Jouffroy shook his head ominously . And not only to the artist were they fatal . It was these that drew such deep lines on the faces of women still young . It was these that destroyed ability and hope , and killed God only knew how many of His good gifts ! Poverty : that could be endured with all its difficulties , if that were the one anxiety . It was never the one but the multitude of troubles that destroyed . Serenity there must be . A man knew that , and insisted on having it . Friends were no true friends if they robbed one of it . For him , he had a poor opinion of that which people called affection , regard . As for l'amour , that was the supreme egotism . The affections were simply a means to “
123104	123133	123101	123101	oneself	2638	” Affection ! Bah ! One did not offer it for nothing , bien sûr ! It was through this insufferable pretext that one arrived at governing others . “
123172	123183	123166	123166	you	2639	” Jouffroy opened his eyes , with a scornful glare . “
123199	123200	123190	123190	I	0	” “
123205	123209	123190	123190	I	0	” said Hadria , “
123240	123241	123242	123242	Madame	232	” “
123279	123283	123274	123274	you	232	” Hadria laughed . “
123294	123298	123274	123274	you	232	” she said , “
123329	123333	123363	123364	mon Dieu	2649	” Jouffroy smiled . “
123350	123354	123335	123342	some conquering hero reappearing in ringlets and mittens	2646	” Jouffroy grinned . “
123359	123360	123335	123342	some conquering hero reappearing in ringlets and mittens	2646	” “
123366	123371	123335	123342	some conquering hero reappearing in ringlets and mittens	2646	” cried Madame Vauchelet , “
123398	124062	123335	123342	some conquering hero reappearing in ringlets and mittens	2646	” STUBBORNLY Hadria sent her packets to the publishers ; the publishers as firmly returned them . She had two sets flying now , like tennis balls , she wrote to Miss Du Prel : one set across the Channel . The publishers , she feared , played the best game , but she had the English quality of not knowing when she was beaten . Valeria had succeeded in finding a place for two of the articles . This was encouraging , but funds were running alarmingly low . The apartement would have either to be given up , or to be taken on for another term , at the end of the week . A decision must be made . Hadria was dismayed to find her strength beginning to fail . That made the thought of the future alarming . With health and vigour nothing seemed impossible , but without that — It seemed absurd that there should be so much difficulty about earning a living . Other women had done it . Valeria had always made light of the matter — when she had the theory of the sovereignty of the will to support . Another couple of articles which seemed to their creator to possess popular qualities were sent off . But after a weary delay , they shared the fate of their predecessors . Hadria now moved into a smaller suite of rooms , parting regretfully with Therèse , and flinging herself once more on the mercy of a landlady . This time M. Thillard had discovered the lodging for her ; a shabby , but sunny little house , kept by a motherly woman with a reputation for perfect honesty . Expenses were thus kept down , but unhappily very little was coming in to meet them . It was impossible to pull through the year at this rate . But , of course , there was daily hope of something turning up . The arrival of the post was always an exciting moment . At last Hadria wrote to ask Algitha to try and sell for her a spray of diamonds , worth about eighty pounds . Time must be gained , at all hazards . Algitha tried everywhere , and enquired in all directions , but could not get more than five - and - twenty pounds for it . She felt anxious about her sister , and thought of coming over to Paris to see her , in order to talk over some matters that could no longer be kept out of sight . Algitha had wished to give Hadria an opportunity for work and rest , and to avoid recurrence of worry ; but it was no longer possible or fair to conceal the fact that there were troubles looming ahead , at Dunaghee . Their father had suffered several severe losses through some bank failures ; and now that wretched company in which he had always had such faith appeared to be shaky , and if that were also to smash , the state of affairs would be desperate . Their father , in his optimistic fashion , still believed that the company would pull through . Of course all this anxiety was telling seriously on their mother . And , alas she had been fretting very much about Hadria . After Algitha 's misdeed , this second blow struck hard . One must act on one 's own convictions and not on those of somebody else , however beloved that other person might be , but truly the penalty of daring to take an independent line of action was almost unbearably severe . It really seemed , at times , as if there were nothing for it but to fold one 's hands and do exactly as one was bid . Algitha was beginning to wonder whether her own revolt was about to be expiated by a life - long remorse ! “
124132	124441	124128	124128	she	3851	” Algitha said that her mother evidently felt Hadria 's departure as a disgrace to the family . It was pathetic to hear her trying to answer people 's casual questions about her , so as to conceal the facts without telling an untruth . Hadria was overwhelmed by this letter . Her first impulse was to pack up and go straight to Dunaghee . But as Algitha was there now , this seemed useless , at any rate for the present . And ought she after all to abandon her project , for which so much had been risked , so much pain inflicted ? The question that she and Algitha thought they had decided long ago , began to beat again at the door of her conscience and her pity . Her reason still asserted that the suffering which people entail upon themselves , through a frustrated desire to force their own law of conduct on others , must be borne by themselves , as the penalty of their own tyrannous instinct and of their own narrow thought . It was utterly unfair to thrust that natural penalty of prejudice and of self - neglect on to the shoulders of others . Why should they be protected from the appointed punishment , by the offering of another life on the altar of their prejudice ? Why should such a sacrifice be made in order to gratify their tyrannical desire to dictate ? It was not fair , it was not reasonable . Yet this conclusion of the intellect did not prevent the pain of pity and compunction , nor an inconsequent sense of guilt . Meanwhile it would be best , perhaps , to await Algitha 's arrival , when affairs might be in a less uncertain state . All decision must be postponed till then . “
124447	125138	124128	124128	she	3851	” she wrote to her sister . To add to the anxieties of the moment , little Martha seemed to lose in energy since coming to the new abode , and Hadria began to fear that the house was not quite healthy . It was very cheap , and the landlady was honest , but if it had this serious drawback , another move , with probably another drawback , seemed to threaten . This was particularly troublesome , for who could tell how long it would be possible to remain in Paris ? Hadria thought of the doctrine of the sovereignty of the will , and of all the grand and noble things that the Preposterous Society had said about it , not to mention Emerson and others — and she smiled . However , she worked on , putting aside her anxieties , as far as was possible . She would not fail for lack of will , at any rate . But it was a hard struggle . Martha had to be very carefully watched just now . Happily , after a few anxious days , she began to recover her fresh colour and her high spirits . The move would not be necessary , after all . Hadria had become more and more attached to the child , whose lovable qualities developed with her growth . She was becoming singularly like her unhappy mother , in feature and in colouring . Her eyes were large and blue and sweet , with a little touch of pathos in them that Hadria could not bear to see . It seemed almost like the after - glow of the mother 's suffering . Although adding to Hadria 's anxieties , the child gave a sense of freshness and youth to the little ménage . She made the anxieties easier to bear . Hadria came in , one morning , from her work , tired and full of foreboding . Hat and cloak were laid aside , and she sank into an arm - chair , lying back to lazily watch the efforts of the child to overturn the obstinate blue man , who was still the favourite plaything , perhaps because he was less amenable than the rest . Martha looked up for sympathy . She wished to be helped in her persistent efforts to get the better of this upstart blue man with the red cap , who serenely resumed his erect position just as often as he was forced to the ground . He was a stout , healthy - looking person , inclining to embonpoint ; bound to succeed , if only from sheer solidity of person . Hadria was drawn into the game , and the two spent a good half hour on the rug together , playing with that and other toys which Martha toddled off to the cupboard to collect . The child was in great delight . Hadria was playing with her ; she liked that better than having Jean Paul Auguste to play with . He took her toys away and always wanted to play a different game . The clock struck two . Hadria felt that she ought to go and see Madame Vauchelet ; it was more than a week since she had called , and the kind old friend was always gently pained at an absence of that length . Then there was an article to finish , and she ought really to write to Dunaghee and Henriette and — well the rest must wait . Several other calls were also more than due , but it was useless even to consider those to - day . In spite of an oppressive sense of having much to do — perhaps because of it — Hadria felt as if it were a sheer impossibility to rise from that hearthrug . Besides , Martha would not hear of it . A desire to rest , to idle , to float down the stream , instead of trying always to swim against it , became overpowering . The minutes passed away . “
125145	125168	125143	125143	Martha	129	” Hadria said gravely , as she proceeded to pile up a towering edifice of bricks , at the child 's command , “
125289	125290	125317	125317	they	2662	” “
125294	125304	125317	125317	they	2662	” said Martha with frank vanity , and then : “
125308	125309	125317	125317	they	2662	” “
125367	125368	125361	125361	they	2663	” “
125373	125403	125404	125404	They	2664	” said Martha , thrusting forth a mischievous hand , which was caught in time to prevent entire destruction of the precious edifice . Half the minarets had fallen . “
125410	125414	125404	125404	They	2664	” said Hadria . “
125427	125566	125404	125404	They	2664	” But Martha laughed with the delight of easy conquest . She watched with great interest the reconstruction , and seemed anxious that every detail should be finished and worthy her iconoclasm . Having satisfied herself that her strength would not be wasted on an incomplete object , she made a second attempt to lay the palace low . Again she was frustrated . The building had soared , by this time , to an ambitious height , and its splendour had reached the limits of the materials at command . The final pinnacle which was required to cope the structure had been mislaid . Hadria was searching for it , when Martha , seizing her chance , struck the palace a blow in its very heart , and in an instant , the whole was a wreck . “
125600	125611	125612	125612	Hadria	211	“ One would suppose you were a County - Council , ”
125615	125635	125612	125612	Hadria	211	“ or the practical man . No , you shall have no more beauty to annihilate , little Vandal . ”
125677	125692	125666	125666	She	129	“ I wish I could get at the sawdust that I am stuffed with , ”
125705	125760	125761	125761	She	211	“ It is wonderful how little one does know one 's own sawdust . It would be convenient to feel a little surer just now , for evidently I shall need it all very soon . And I feel somewhat like that doll , with the stream pouring out and the body getting limp . ”
126990	126994	127011	127011	he	248	“ la famille . ”
127221	127237	127208	127208	she	211	“ They are to you , Madame , an oppression , a weariness , a — ”
127238	127265	127203	127203	his	248	“ M. Jouffroy , I have never spoken to you about these things . I can not see how you are in a position to judge . ”
127266	127296	127203	127203	his	248	“ Ah , but I know . Have I not heard cette chère Madame Bertaux describe the life of an English village ? And have I not seen — ? ”
127297	127301	127208	127208	she	211	“ Seen what ? ”
127302	127363	127364	127364	Jouffroy	248	“ Cette dame . I have seen her at your apartment this afternoon . Do not annihilate me , Madame ; I mean not to offend you . The lady has come from England on purpose to entrap you ; she came last night , and she stays at the Hotel du Louvre . She spoke to me of you . ”
127371	127386	127366	127366	his	248	“ Ha ! then I understood , and I fled hither to save you . ”
127387	127410	127413	127414	the lady	3679	“ Tell me , tell me quickly , Monsieur , has she fair hair and large grey eyes . Is she tall ? ”
127428	127484	127413	127414	the lady	3679	“ A lady , elegant , well - dressed , but , ah ! a woman to destroy the soul of an artist merely by her presence . I told her that you had decided to remain in France , to adopt it as your country , for it was the country of your soul ! ”
127485	127489	127491	127491	Hadria	211	“ Good heavens ! ”
127510	127546	127548	127548	Jouffroy	248	“ I told her that your friends would not let you go back to England , to the land of fogs , the land of the bourgeois . The lady seemed astonished , even indignant , ”
127555	127698	127700	127700	Jouffroy	248	“ and she endeavoured to make me silent , but she did not have success , I promise you . I appealed to her . I pointed out to her your unique power . I reminded her that such power is a gift supreme to the world , which the world must not lose . For the making of little ones and the care of the ménage , there were other women , but you — you were a priestess in the temple of art , you were without prejudice , without the bourgeois conscience , grâce au ciel ! you had the religion of the artist , and your worship was paid at the shrine of Apollo . Enfin , I counselled this elegant lady to return to England and to leave you in peace . Always with a perfect politeness , ”
127736	127743	127744	127744	she	211	“ I must return at once , ”
127747	127758	127744	127744	she	211	“ I fear something must have gone wrong at home . ”
127764	127860	127759	127759	Jouffroy	248	“ But I tell you , Madame , that she will drag you back to your fogs ; she will tell you some foolish story , she will address herself to your pity . Your family has doubtless become ill . Families have that habit when they desire to achieve something . Bah , it is easy to become ill when one is angry , and so to make oneself pitied and obeyed . It is a common usage . Madame , beware ; it is for you the critical moment . One must choose . ”
127861	127874	127744	127744	she	211	“ It is not always a matter of choice , M. Jouffroy . ”
127875	127878	127879	127879	he	2721	“ Always , ”
127989	127992	127980	127980	One	329	“ les femmes ”
127998	128015	128017	128017	Hadria	211	“ But of whom one demands the duties of human beings and the courage of heroes , ”
128019	128022	128024	128024	Jouffroy	248	“ Justement , ”
128092	128253	128260	128260	Jouffroy	248	“ This is the moment for decision . Remain now among us , and pursue your studies with a calm mind , and I promise you — I , Jouffroy , who have the right to speak on this matter — I promise you shall have a success beyond the wildest dreams of your ambition . Madame , you do not guess your own power . I know how your genius can be saved to the world ; I know the artist 's nature . Have I not had the experience of twenty years ? I know what feeds and rouses it , and I know what kills it . And this I tell you , Madame , that if you stay here , you have a stupendous future before you ; if you return to your fogs and your tea - parties — ah , then , Madame , your genius will die and your heart will be broken . ”
128341	128356	128336	128336	Henriette	142	“ What is it ? Tell me at once , if anything is wrong . ”
128357	128365	128367	128368	Miss Temperley	141	“ Then you knew I was here ! ”
128370	128396	128367	128368	Miss Temperley	141	“ Yes ; M. Jouffroy told me . He found me at St. Cloud . Quick , Henriette , do n't keep me in suspense . ”
128397	128405	128406	128406	Henriette	142	“ There is nothing of immediate seriousness , ”
128826	128829	128831	128831	Hadria	211	“ Ah ! ”
128856	128861	128863	128863	Hadria	211	“ And your mission , ”
128867	128875	128863	128863	Hadria	211	“ is to recapture the lost bird . ”
128876	128884	128886	128887	Miss Temperley	141	“ We are considering your own good , ”
128889	128918	128920	128920	Hadria	211	“ If I have not always done what I ought to have done in my life , it is not for want of guidance and advice from others , ”
128928	128946	128920	128920	Hadria	211	“ You are giving everyone so much pain , Hadria . Do you never think of that ? ”
128990	129021	128971	128971	Hadria	211	“ If you would use your ability on behalf of your sex instead of against it , Henriette , women would have cause to bless you , for all time ! ”
129022	129043	129044	129045	Miss Temperley	141	“ Ah ! if you did but know it , I am using what ability I have on their behalf , ”
129048	129082	129044	129045	Miss Temperley	141	“ I am trying to keep them true to their noble mission . But I did not come to discuss general questions . I came to appeal to your best self , Hadria . ”
129083	129088	129090	129090	Hadria	211	“ I am ready , ”
129092	129143	129090	129090	Hadria	211	“ Only , before you start , I want you to remember clearly what took place at Dunaghee before my marriage ; for I foresee that our disagreement will chiefly hang upon your lapse of memory on that point , and upon my perhaps inconveniently distinct recollection of those events . ”
129144	129161	129163	129163	Henriette	142	“ I wish to lay before you certain facts and certain results of your present conduct , ”
129165	129185	129163	129163	Henriette	142	“ Very good . I wish to lay before you certain facts and certain results of your past conduct . ”
129186	129197	129090	129090	Hadria	211	“ Ah ! do not let us wrangle , Hadria . ”
129198	129248	129090	129090	Hadria	211	“ I do n't wish to wrangle , but I must keep hold of these threads that you seem always to drop . And then there is another point : when I talked of leaving home , it was not I who suggested that it should be for ever . ”
129249	129256	129258	129258	Henriette	142	“ I know , I know , ”
129261	129320	129324	129324	he	2745	“ I have again and again pointed out to Hubert how wrong he was in that , and how he gave you a pretext for what you have done . I admit it and regret it deeply . Hubert lost his temper ; that is the fact of the matter . He thought himself bitterly wronged by you . ”

129474	129478	129429	129430	his ambassador	2749	” said Hadria . “

129776	129781	129773	129773	I	0	” Miss Temperley stared . “
129793	129799	129782	129782	You	142	” she said at length . “
129807	129808	129782	129782	You	142	” “
129829	129874	129820	129820	I	0	” It is simple enough . I deny that motherhood has duties except when it is absolutely free , absolutely uninfluenced by the pressure of opinion , or by any of the innumerable tyrannies that most children have now to thank for their existence . ”
129881	129907	129878	129878	her	141	“ I do n't see that any ‘ tyranny , ’ as you call it , exonerates a mother from her duty to her child . ”
129908	130023	129820	129820	I	0	“ There we differ . Motherhood , in our present social state , is the sign and seal as well as the means and method of a woman 's bondage . It forges chains of her own flesh and blood ; it weaves cords of her own love and instinct . She agonizes , and the fruit of her agony is not even legally hers . Name me a position more abject ! A woman with a child in her arms is , to me , the symbol of an abasement , an indignity , more complete , more disfiguring and terrible , than any form of humiliation that the world has ever seen . ”
130024	130030	130032	130033	Miss Temperley	141	“ You must be mad ! ”
130035	130051	130032	130033	Miss Temperley	141	“ That symbol has stood to the world for all that is sweetest and holiest . ”
130052	130065	129820	129820	I	0	“ I know it has ! So profound has been our humiliation ! ”
130066	130086	130087	130087	Hadria	211	“ I do n't know what to say to anyone so wrong - headed and so twisted in sentiment . ”
130091	130197	130087	130087	Hadria	211	“ While I am about it , I may as well finish this disclosure of feeling , which , again I warn you , is not peculiar to myself , however you may lay that flattering unction to your soul . I have seen and heard of many a saddening evidence of our sex 's slavery since I came to this terrible and wonderful city : the crude , obvious buying and selling that we all shudder at ; but hideous as it is , to me it is far less awful than this other respectable form of degradation that everyone glows and smirks over . ”
130206	130230	130201	130201	her	141	“ I simply ca n't understand you . What you say is rank heresy against all that is most beautiful in human nature . ”
130231	130289	130087	130087	Hadria	211	“ Surely the rank heresy is to be laid at the door of those who degrade and enslave that which they assert to be most beautiful in human nature . But I am not speaking to convince ; merely to shew where you can not count upon me for a point of attack . Try something else . ”
130290	130317	130087	130087	Hadria	211	“ But it is so strange , so insane , as it seems to me . Do you mean to throw contempt on motherhood per se ? ”
130318	130430	130201	130201	her	141	“ I am not discussing motherhood per se ; no woman has yet been in a position to know what it is per se , strange as it may appear . No woman has yet experienced it apart from the enormous pressure of law and opinion that has , always , formed part of its inevitable conditions . The illegal mother is hounded by her fellows in one direction ; the legal mother is urged and incited in another : free motherhood is unknown amongst us . I speak of it as it is . To speak of it per se , for the present , is to discuss the transcendental . ”
130447	130525	130440	130440	Hadria	211	“ You know well enough , Henriette , what thousands of women there are to whom the birth of their children is an intolerable burden , and a fierce misery from which many would gladly seek escape by death . And indeed many do seek escape by death . What is the use of this eternal conspiracy of silence about that which every woman out of her teens knows as well as she knows her own name ? ”
130549	130560	130562	130562	Hadria	211	“ I do n't deny the potency of the instinct , ”
130564	130633	130562	130562	Hadria	211	“ but I do say that it is shamefully presumed upon . Strong it obviously must be , if industrious cultivation and encouragements and threats and exhortations can make it so ! All the Past as well as all the weight of opinion and training in the Present has been at work on it , thrusting and alluring and coercing the woman to her man - allotted fate . ”
130634	130643	130645	130645	Henriette	142	“ Nature - allotted , if you please , ”
130647	130657	130645	130645	Henriette	142	“ There is no need for alluring or coercing . ”
130658	130729	130562	130562	Hadria	211	“ Why do it then ? Now , be frank , Henriette , and try not to be offended . Would you feel no sense of indignity in performing a function of this sort ( however noble and so on you might think it per se ) , you knew that it would be demanded of you as a duty , if you did not welcome it as a joy ? ”
130730	130749	130562	130562	Hadria	211	“ I should acknowledge it as a duty , if I did not welcome it as a joy . ”
130750	130764	130645	130645	Henriette	142	“ In other words , you would accept the position of a slave . ”
130765	130769	130562	130562	Hadria	211	“ How so ? ”
130770	130852	130562	130562	Hadria	211	“ By bartering your womanhood , by using these powers of body , in return for food and shelter and social favour , or for the sake of so - called ‘ duty ’ irrespective of — perhaps in direct opposition to your feelings . How then do you differ from the slave woman who produces a progeny of young slaves , to be disposed of as shall seem good to her perhaps indulgent master ? I see no essential difference . ”
130853	130863	130865	130865	Henriette	142	“ I see the difference between honour and ignominy , ”
130874	130919	130869	130869	her	211	“ The differences are all in detail and in circumstance . I am sorry if I offend your taste . The facts are offensive . The bewildering thing is that the facts themselves never seem to offend you ; only the mention of them . ”
130920	130932	130934	130934	Henriette	142	“ It would take too long to go into this subject , ”
130936	130956	130934	130934	Henriette	142	“ I can only repeat that I fail to understand your extraordinary views of the holiest of human instincts . ”
130957	130991	130562	130562	Hadria	211	“ That catch - word ! And you use it rashly , Henriette , for do you not know that the deepest of all degradation comes of misusing that which is most holy ? ”
130992	131008	131010	131011	Miss Temperley	141	“ A woman who does her duty is not to be accused of misusing anything , ”
131014	131120	131010	131011	Miss Temperley	141	“ Is there then no sin , no misuse of power in sending into the world swarms of fortuitous , poverty - stricken human souls , as those souls must be who are born in bondage , with the blended instincts of the slave and the master for a proud inheritance ? It sounds awful I know , but truth is apt to sound awful . Motherhood , as our wisdom has appointed it , among civilized people , represents a prostitution of the reproductive powers , which precisely corresponds to that other abuse , which seems to most of us so infinitely more shocking . ”
131172	131180	131182	131182	Henriette	142	“ She is really growing very pretty , ”
131237	131254	131255	131255	Hadria	211	“ I do n't yet quite understand , Henriette , your object in coming to Paris . ”
131262	131278	131255	131255	Hadria	211	“ I came to make an appeal to your sense of duty and your generosity . ”
131279	131282	131288	131288	Henriette	142	“ Ah ! ”
131283	131287	131288	131288	Henriette	142	“ I came , ”
131301	131320	131293	131293	herself	142	“ to remind you that when you married , you entered into a contract which you now repudiate . ”
131329	131355	131321	131321	Hadria	211	“ I did no such thing , and you know it , Henriette . How do you dare to sit there and tell me that ? ”
131356	131379	131380	131381	Miss Temperley	141	“ I tell you nothing but the truth . Every woman who marries enters , by that fact , into a contract . ”
131406	131465	131401	131401	She	211	“ Then you actually intended to entrap me into this so - called contract , by leading me to suppose that it would mean nothing more between Hubert and myself than an unavoidable formality ! You tell me this to my face , and do n't appear to see that you are confessing an act of deliberate treachery . ”
131466	131469	131471	131471	Henriette	142	“ Nonsense , ”
131473	131490	131471	131471	Henriette	142	“ There was nothing that any sane person would have objected to , in our conduct . ”
131514	131588	131504	131504	She	211	“ And yet you would have felt yourselves stained with dishonour for the rest of your lives had you procured anything else on false pretences ! But a woman — that is a different affair . The code of honour does not here apply , it would seem . Any fraud may be honourably practised on her , and wild is the surprise and indignation if she objects when she finds it out . ”
131589	131595	131597	131597	Henriette	142	“ You are perfectly mad , ”
131611	131666	131597	131597	Henriette	142	“ What I say is true , whether I be mad or sane . What you call the ‘ contract ’ is simply a cunning contrivance for making a woman and her possible children the legal property of a man , and for enlisting her own honour and conscience to safeguard the disgraceful transaction . ”
131667	131670	131672	131672	Henriette	142	“ Ah , ”
131681	131693	131672	131672	Henriette	142	“ then you admit that her honour and conscience are enlisted ? ”
131694	131802	131597	131597	Henriette	142	“ Certainly , in the case of most women . That enlistment is a masterpiece of policy . To make a prisoner his own warder is surely no light stroke of genius . But that is exactly what I refused to be from the first , and no one could have spoken more plainly . And now you are shocked and pained and aggrieved because I wo n't eat my words . Yet we have talked over all this , in my room at Dunaghee , by the hour . Oh ! Henriette , why did you not listen to your conscience and be honest with me ? ”
131803	131810	131597	131597	Henriette	142	“ Hadria , you insult me . ”
131811	131852	131672	131672	Henriette	142	“ Why could not Hubert choose one among the hundreds and thousands of women who would have passed under the yoke without a question , and have gladly harnessed herself to his chariot by the reins of her own conscience ? ”
131853	131861	131862	131862	Henriette	142	“ I would to heaven he had ! ”
131878	131913	131872	131872	her	211	“ Ah , why did he not meet my frankness with an equal frankness , at the time ? All this trouble would have been saved us both if only he had been honest . ”
131914	131925	131672	131672	Henriette	142	“ My dear , he was in love with you . ”
131926	131948	131949	131949	Hadria	211	“ And so he thought himself justified in deceiving me . There is indeed war to the knife between the sexes ! ”
131971	132009	131949	131949	Hadria	211	“ It is not fair to use that word . I tell you that we both confidently expected that when you had more experience you would be like other women and adjust yourself sensibly to your conditions . ”
132010	132014	132016	132016	Hadria	211	“ I see , ”
132018	132080	132016	132016	Hadria	211	“ and so it was decided that Hubert was to pretend to have no objections to my wild ideas , so as to obtain my consent , trusting to the ponderous bulk of circumstance to hold me flat and subservient when I no longer had a remedy in my power . You neither of you lack brains , at any rate . ”
132093	132111	132112	132112	she	142	“ In ninety - nine cases out of a hundred , our forecasts would have come true , ”
132115	132119	132112	132112	she	142	“ I mean — ”
132120	132126	132128	132128	Hadria	211	“ That is refreshingly frank , ”
132130	132139	132128	132128	Hadria	211	“ We thought we acted for the best . ”
132140	132174	132112	132112	she	142	“ Oh , if it comes to that , the Spanish Inquisitors doubtless thought that they were acting for the best , when they made bonfires of heretics in the market - places . ”
132189	132208	132209	132209	she	142	“ Well , if there be any one at fault in the matter , I am the culprit , ”
132217	132307	132209	132209	she	142	“ It was I who assured Hubert that experience would alter you . It was I who represented to him that though you might be impulsive , even hard at times , you could not persist in a course that would give pain , and that if you saw that any act of yours caused him to suffer , you would give it up . I was convinced that your character was good and noble au fond , Hadria , and I have believed it up to this moment . ”
132321	132337	132338	132338	she	211	“ You make me regret that I ever had a good or a pitiful impulse ! ”
132366	132378	132359	132359	Henriette	142	“ Why do you always resist your better nature , Hadria ? ”
132379	132450	132466	132466	her	141	“ You use it against me . It is the same with all women . Let them beware of their ‘ better natures , ’ poor hunted fools ! for that ‘ better nature ’ will be used as a dog - chain , by which the ! can be led , like toy - terriers , from beginning to end of what they are pleased to call their lives ! ”
132451	132458	132466	132466	her	141	“ Oh , Hadria , Hadria ! ”
132478	132624	132466	132466	her	141	“ It is cunning , shallow , heartless women , who really fare best in our society ; its conditions suit them . They have no pity , no sympathy to make a chain of ; they do n't mind stooping to conquer ; they do n't mind playing upon the weaker , baser sides of men 's natures ; they do n't mind appealing , for their own ends , to the pity and generosity of others ; they do n't mind swallowing indignity and smiling abjectly , like any woman of the harem at her lord , so that they gain their object . That is the sort of ‘ woman 's nature ’ that our conditions are busy selecting . Let us cultivate it . We live in a scientific age ; the fittest survive . Let us be ‘ fit . ’ ”
132625	132644	132646	132646	Henriette	142	“ Let us be womanly , let us do our duty , let us hearken to our conscience ! ”
132648	132701	132646	132646	Henriette	142	“ Thank you ! If my conscience is going to be made into a helm by which others may guide me according to their good pleasure , the sooner that helm is destroyed the better . That is the conclusion to which you drive me and the rest of us , Henriette . ”
132702	132714	132716	132717	Miss Temperley	141	“ Charity demands that I do not believe what you say , ”
132719	132729	132716	132717	Miss Temperley	141	“ Oh , do n't trouble to be charitable ! ”
132736	132739	132740	132740	she	142	“ Hadria , ”
132743	132801	132740	132740	she	142	“ are you going to allow your petty rancour about this — well , I will call it error of ours , if you like to be severe — are you going to bear malice and ruin your own life and Hubert 's and the children 's ? Are you so unforgiving , so lacking in generosity ? ”
132802	132815	132817	132817	Hadria	211	“ You call it an error . I call it a treachery , ”
132819	132861	132817	132817	Hadria	211	“ Why should the results of that treachery be thrust on to my shoulders to bear ? Why should my generosity be summoned to your rescue ? But I suppose you calculated on that sub - consciously , at the time . ”
132862	132865	132740	132740	she	142	“ Hadria ! ”
132866	132944	132817	132817	Hadria	211	“ This is a moment for plain speaking , if ever there was one . You must have reckoned on an appeal to my generosity , and on the utter helplessness of my position when once I was safely entrapped . It was extremely clever and well thought out . Do you suppose that you would have dared to act as you did , if there had been means of redress in my hands , after marriage ? ”
132958	132963	132955	132955	my	0	” said Henriette bitterly . “
133011	133012	133013	133013	You	211	” “
133024	133025	133013	133013	You	211	” “
133043	133044	133035	133035	you	142	” “
133053	133054	133057	133057	you	142	” “
133069	133077	133057	133057	you	142	” Henriette rose with a vivid flush . “
133092	133093	133090	133090	I	0	” “
133100	133116	133096	133096	I	0	” Hadria advanced towards Miss Temperley , and stood looking her full in the face . “
133378	133458	133367	133367	You	0	” Hadria was pacing restlessly up and down the room . Little Martha ran out with her doll , and offered it , as if with a view to chase away the perturbed look from Hadria 's face . The latter stooped mechanically and took the doll , smiling her thanks , and stroking the child 's fair curls tenderly . Then she recommenced her walk up and down the room , carrying the doll carefully on her arm . “
133464	133476	133367	133367	You	0	” Martha recommended , and went back to her other toys . “
133613	133623	133626	133626	Hadria	211	” Hadria recommenced her restless pacing to and fro . “
133649	133659	133643	133643	I	0	” ( Hadria gave a little scornful cry . ) “
133684	133689	133690	133690	I	0	” Hadria stopped abruptly . “
133757	133764	133753	133753	mother	3851	” Hadria broke into a laugh . “
133770	133776	133777	133777	I	0	” Henriette shrugged her shoulders . “
133823	133824	133825	133825	Henriette	142	” “
133896	133897	133858	133858	him	1288	” “
133904	133908	133858	133858	him	1288	” cried Henriette . “
133917	133918	133919	133919	Hubert	118	” “
133932	133933	133919	133919	Hubert	118	” “
133998	133999	134000	134000	You	142	” “
134005	134061	134000	134000	You	142	” cried Henriette , rising . By this time , Hadria had allowed the doll to slip back , and its limp body was hanging down disconsolately from her elbow , although she was clutching it , with absent - minded anxiety , to her side , in the hope of arresting its threatened fall . “
134072	134095	134000	134000	You	142	” cried Martha reproachfully . Hadria seized its legs and pulled it back again , murmuring some consolatory promise to its mistress . “
134156	134163	134153	134154	Professor Fortescue	116	” Henriette gave a horrified gesture . “
134184	134202	134203	134203	I	0	” Miss Temperley had lost self - control for a moment . Hadria looked at her steadily . “
134236	134237	134221	134221	Hubert	118	” “
134240	134267	134221	134221	Hubert	118	” Hadria had come forward and was standing with her left elbow on the mantel - piece , the doll still tucked under her right arm . “
134288	134289	134269	134269	you	142	” “
134296	134304	134305	134305	You	142	” murmured Henriette , turning very white . “
134385	134394	134395	134395	I	0	” Henriette covered her face with her hands . “
134400	134406	134421	134421	I	0	” she said at length , “
134440	134441	134443	134443	you	142	” “
134477	134492	134495	134495	you	142	” Henriette sprang forward white and trembling , and clutched Hadria 's arm excitedly . “
134525	134538	134521	134521	You	142	” Hadria was moved with pity at Henriette 's white quivering face . “
134543	134550	134521	134521	You	142	” she said , more gently . “
134563	134599	134521	134521	You	142	” ( A hideous crash from the overturning of one of Martha 's Eiffel Towers seemed to belie the words . ) Miss Temperley 's clutch relaxed , and she gave a gasp of relief . “
134614	134615	134606	134606	you	211	” “
134630	134631	134623	134623	I	0	” “
134675	134676	134652	134652	you	211	” “
134683	134687	134652	134652	you	211	” said Hadria ; “
134698	134699	134702	134702	you	211	” “
134707	134708	134702	134702	you	211	” “
134774	134792	134761	134761	I	0	” Miss Temperley drew another deep breath , and the colour began to return to her face . “
134799	134803	134761	134761	I	0	” she said . “
134819	134820	134761	134761	I	0	” “
134873	134881	134883	134883	you	211	” Henriette sank wearily into her chair . “
134911	134918	134883	134883	you	211	” Hadria hesitated for a moment . “
134968	134969	134965	134965	she	3753	” “
134981	134985	134976	134976	she	3753	” cried Henriette . “
135041	135042	135047	135047	you	0	” “
135053	135059	135047	135047	you	0	” began Henriette , weakly . “
135071	135072	135060	135060	I	0	” “
135083	135097	135074	135074	you	0	” Hadria looked at her sister - in - law , in silence . “
135107	135108	135101	135101	you	0	” “
135132	135133	135110	135110	I	0	” “
135199	135200	135201	135201	I	0	” “
135268	135269	135270	135270	You	0	” “
135283	135292	135281	135281	Hadria	211	” cried Miss Temperley , rising to leave . “
135304	135305	135281	135281	Hadria	211	” “
135319	135323	135281	135281	Hadria	211	” said Hadria . “
135359	135370	135371	135371	You	0	” Miss Temperley shrugged her shoulders , sadly and hopelessly . “
135412	135420	135401	135401	I	0	” Miss Temperley moved towards the door . “
135563	135564	135565	135565	I	0	” “
135573	135598	135565	135565	I	0	” exclaimed Henriette . Hadria 's eyes flashed , and she stood drawn up , straight and defiant , before the mantel - piece . “
135659	135660	135661	135661	I	0	” “
135674	135920	135666	135666	you	0	” said Henriette . The doll fell with a great crash , into the fender among the fire - irons , and there was a little burst of laughter . Miss Temperley passed through the door , at the same instant , with great dignity . AS Hadria had foretold , she commenced the attack on herself as soon as Henriette had departed , and all night long , the stormy inner debate was kept up . Her mind never wavered , but her heart was rebellious . Hubert deserved to pay for his conduct ; but if we all had to pay for our conduct to the uttermost farthing , that would be hard , if just . If Hadria assumed the burden of Hubert 's debt , it would mean what M. Jouffroy had pointed out . Hubert 's suffering would be only on account of offended public opinion ; hers — but then her parents would suffer as well as Hubert . Round and round went the thoughts , like vast wheels , and when towards morning , she dozed off a little , the wheels were still turning in a vague , weary way , and as they turned , the life seemed to be crushed gradually out of the sleeper . Jouffroy came to enquire whether the decision had been made . He was in a state of great excitement . He gave fervent thanks that Hadria had stood firm . “
135930	135931	135928	135928	Madame	195	” “
135940	135959	135938	135938	Monsieur	2832	” Henriette discreetly forbore to say anything further on the subject of dispute . She waited , hopefully . “
135985	135992	135993	135993	Your	0	” she said , one morning . “
136004	136005	136006	136006	I	0	” “
136009	136013	136006	136006	I	0	” said Hadria . “
136041	136042	136043	136043	Hubert	118	” “
136073	136074	136070	136070	you	0	” “
136077	136081	136070	136070	you	0	” said Hadria . “
136090	136091	136082	136083	My father	4257	” “
136123	136124	136111	136112	the trustees	2838	” “
136129	136130	136111	136112	the trustees	2838	” “
136143	136147	136131	136131	I	0	” said Henriette , “
136208	136209	136211	136211	you	0	” “
136216	136229	136211	136211	you	0	” Next morning , Henriette came with a letter in her hand . “
136233	136336	136211	136211	you	0	” Hadria exclaimed . The letter announced the failure of the Company . It was the final blow . Dunaghee would have to be given up . Mrs. Fullerton 's settlement was all that she and her husband would now have to live upon . Hadria sat gazing at the letter , with a dazed expression . Almost before the full significance of the calamity had been realized , a telegram arrived , announcing that Mrs. Fullerton had fallen dangerously ill . The rest of that day was spent in packing , writing notes , settling accounts , and preparing for departure . “
136344	136352	136211	136211	you	0	” cried Madame Vauchelet , in dismay . “
136363	136962	136211	136211	you	0	” Hadria replied hurriedly , as if the hurry of her speech would quicken her arrival in England . The great arches of the station which had appealed to her imagination , at the moment of arrival , swept upward , hard and grey , in the callous blue light . Hadria breathed deep . Was she the same person who had arrived that night , with every nerve thrilled with hope and resolve ? Ah ! there had been so much to learn , and the time had been so short . Starting with her present additional experience , she could have managed so much better . But of what use to think of that ? How different the homeward journey from the intoxicating outward flight , in the heyday of the spring ! What did that telegram mean ? Ill ; dangerously , dangerously . The words seemed to be repeated cruelly , insistently , by the jogging of the train and the rumble of the wheels . The anxiety gnawed on , rising at times into terror , dulling again to a steady ache . And then remorse began to fit a long - pointed fang into a sensitive spot in her heart . In vain to resist . It was securely placed . Let reason hold her peace . A thousand fears , regrets , self - accusations , revolts , swarmed insect - like in Hadria 's brain , as the train thundered through the darkness , every tumultuous sound and motion exaggerated to the consciousness , by the fact that there was no distraction of the attention by outside objects . Nothing offered itself to the sight except the strange lights and shadows of the lamp thrown on the cushions of the carriage ; Henriette 's figure in one corner , Hannah , with the child , in another , and the various rugs and trappings of wandering Britons . Everything was contracted , narrow . The sea - passage had the same sinister character . Hadria compared it to the crossing of the Styx in Charon 's gloomy ferry - boat . She felt a patriotic thrill on hearing the first mellow English voice pronouncing the first kindly English sentence . The simple , slow , honest quality of the English nature gave one a sense of safety . What splendid raw material to make a nation out of ! But , ah , it was sometimes dull to live with ! These impressions , floating vaguely in the upper currents of the mind , were simultaneous with a thousand thoughts and anxieties , and gusts of bitter fear and grief . What would be the end of it all ? This uprooting from the old home — it wrung one 's heart to think of it . Scarcely could the thought be faced . Her father , an exile from his beloved fields and hills ; her mother banished from her domain of so many years , and after all these disappointments and mortifications and sorrows ! It was piteous . Where would they live ? What would they do ? Hadria fought with her tears . Ah ! it was hard for old people to have to start life anew , bitterly hard . This was the moment for their children to flock to their rescue , to surround them with care , with affection , with devotion ; to make them feel that at least something that could be trusted , was left to them from the wreck . “
136985	137087	136972	136972	you	2843	” MRS . FULLERTON 'S illness proved even more serious than the doctor had expected . She asked so incessantly for her daughters , especially Hadria , that all question of difference between her and Hubert was laid aside , by tacit consent , and the sisters took their place at their mother 's bedside . The doctor said that the patient must have been suffering , for many years , from an exhausted state of the nerves and from some kind of trouble . Had she had any great disappointment or anxiety ? Hadria and Algitha glanced at one another . “
137090	137094	136972	136972	you	2843	” said Algitha , “
137110	137111	137102	137103	troublesome children	2846	” “
137114	137123	137102	137103	troublesome children	2846	” exclaimed the doctor , nodding his head . “
137315	137485	137488	137488	Hadria	211	” A time of terrible anxiety followed , for the inmates of the Red House . The doctor insisted on a trained nurse . Algitha and Hadria felt uneasy when they were away , even for a moment , from the sick - room , but the doctor reminded them of the necessity , for the patient 's sake as well as their own , of keeping up their strength . He warned them that there would be a long strain upon them , and that any lack of common sense , as regards their own health , would certainly diminish the patient 's chances of recovery . Nobody had his clearest judgment and his quickest observation at command , when nervously exhausted . Everything might depend on a moment 's decision , a moment 's swiftness of insight . The warning was not thrown away , but both sisters found the incessant precautions trying . Every thought , every emotion was swallowed up in the one awful anxiety . “
137499	137543	137544	137544	You	211	” cried Algitha , on one still , ominous night , after she had resigned her post at the bedside to the nurse , who was to fill it for a couple of hours , after which Hadria took her turn of watching . “
137550	137558	137548	137548	I	0	” said Hadria , with trembling lips . “
137565	137570	137559	137559	Mother	103	” Algitha went on . “
137583	137584	137586	137586	my	0	” “
137594	137607	137586	137586	my	0	” her sister added . Algitha was walking restlessly to and fro . “
137619	137624	137609	137609	I	0	” she cried tearfully , “
137700	137701	137691	137691	she	103	” “
137715	137744	137691	137691	she	103	” cried Hadria mournfully . She flung open the window of the bedroom , and looked out over the deadly stillness of the fields and the heavy darkness . “
137751	137763	137746	137746	they	3687	” she said , in the same quiet , hopeless tone , “
137773	137774	137836	137837	the doctor	1471	” “
137780	137791	137836	137837	the doctor	1471	” asked Algitha . A clock had struck , outside . “
137814	137815	137836	137837	the doctor	1471	” “
137820	137821	137836	137837	the doctor	1471	” “
137829	137833	137836	137837	the doctor	1471	” cried Algitha . “
137840	137841	137836	137837	the doctor	1471	” “
137855	137856	137850	137850	I	0	” “
137863	137899	137850	137850	I	0	” Algitha urged . Hadria consented at last , to go into her room , which adjoined her sister 's , and lie down on the bed . The door was open between the rooms . “
137906	138109	137900	137900	You	2861	” she stipulated . There was silence for some minutes , but the silence swarmed with the ghosts of voices . The air seemed thick with shapes , and terrors , and strange warnings . The doctor had not disguised the fact that the patient was fighting hard for life , and that it was impossible to predict the result . Everything depended on whether her strength would hold out . The weakness of the heart was an unfortunate element in the case . To save strength and give plentiful nourishment , without heightening the fever , must be the constant effort . Algitha 's experience stood her in good stead . Her practical ability had been quickened and disciplined by her work . She had trained herself in nursing , among other things . Hadria 's experience was small . She had to summon her intelligence to the rescue . The Fullerton stock had never been deficient in this particular . In difficult moments , when rule and tradition had done their utmost , Hadria had often some original device to suggest , to fit the individual case , which tided them over a crisis , or avoided some threatening predicament . “
138114	138121	137900	137900	You	2861	” asked Algitha , very softly . “
138124	138128	137900	137900	You	2861	” said Hadria ; “
138144	138145	138137	138137	I	0	” “
138172	138173	138174	138174	I	0	” “
138195	138196	138184	138184	I	0	” “
138203	138407	138198	138198	I	0	” said Algitha . They stole down stairs together , in the dim light of the oil lamps that were kept burning all night . The clock struck the half - hour as they passed along the landing . A strange fancy came to Hadria , that a dusky figure drifted away before her , as she advanced . It seemed as though death had receded at her approach . The old childish love for her mother had revived in all its force , during this long fight with the reaper of souls . She felt all her energies strung with the tension of battle . She fought against a dark horror that she could not face . Knowing , and realising vividly , that if her mother lived , her own dreams were ended for ever , she wrestled with desperate strength for the life that was at stake . Her father 's silent wretchedness was terrible to see . He would not hear a word of doubt as to the patient 's recovery . He grew angry if anyone hinted at danger . He insisted that his wife was better each day . She would soon be up and well again . “
138412	138420	138198	138198	I	0	” the doctor had confided to Hubert , “
138428	138819	138422	138422	she	2863	” Mr. Fullerton 's extravagant hopefulness sent a thrill along the nerves . It was as if he had uttered the blackest forebodings . The present crisis had stirred a thousand feelings and associations , in Hadria , which had long been slumbering . She seemed to be sent back again , to the days of her childhood . The intervening years were blotted out . She realized now , with agonising vividness , the sadness of her mother 's life , the long stagnation , the slow decay of disused faculties , and the ache that accompanies all processes of decay , physical or moral . Not only the strong appeal of old affection , entwined with the earliest associations , was at work , but the appeal of womanhood itself:—the grey sad story of a woman 's life , bare and dumb and pathetic in its irony and pain : the injury from without , and then the self - injury , its direct offspring ; unnecessary , yet inevitable ; the unconscious thirst for the sacrifice of others , the hungry claims of a nature unfulfilled , the groping instinct to bring the balance of renunciation to the level , and indemnify oneself for the loss suffered and the spirit offered up . And that propitiation had to be made . It was as inevitable as that the doom of Orestes should follow the original crime of the house of Atreus . Hadria 's whole thought and strength were now centred on the effort to bring about that propitiation , in her own person . She prepared the altar and sharpened the knife . In that subtle and ironical fashion , her fate was steadily at work . The sick - room was very still when the sisters entered . It was both warm and fresh . A night - light burnt on the table , where cups and bottles were ranged , a spirit - lamp and kettle , and other necessaries . The night - light threw long , stealthy shadows over the room . The fire burnt with a red glow . The bed lay against the long wall . As the two figures entered , there was a faint sound of quick panting , and a moan . Hadria rushed to the bedside . “
138827	138863	138422	138422	she	2863	” she called . Algitha flew to the table for the brandy , noticing with horror , as she passed , that the nurse had fallen asleep at her post . Algitha shook her hastily . “
138870	138873	138867	138868	Mr. Fullerton	89	” she said sharply,”and
138878	138921	138867	138868	Mr. Fullerton	89	” The patient was sinking . The nurse vanished . Algitha had handed the cup of brandy to Hadria . The sisters stood by the bedside , scarcely daring to breathe . Mr. Fullerton entered hurriedly , with face pallid and drawn . “
138930	138931	138927	138927	she	2864	” “
138957	139001	139002	139002	I	0	” Hadria had administered the brandy , and stood watching breathlessly , for signs of revival . She gave one questioning glance at Algitha . Her trust in the nurse was gone . Algitha signed hope . The patient 's breathing was easier . “
139013	139017	139030	139030	father	3862	” Hadria whispered . “
139038	139061	139032	139032	she	2864	” The ticking of the clock could be heard , in the dim light . Algitha was holding her mother 's wrist . “
139064	139074	139032	139032	she	2864	” she said , Hadria drew a deep sigh . “
139085	139086	139087	139087	She	2864	” “
139097	139162	139087	139087	She	2864	” cried Mr. Fullerton , eagerly . The nurse went to prepare the extract which the doctor had ordered for the patient , when quickly - digested nourishment was required . It gave immediate strength . The brandy had stimulated the sinking organs to a saving effort ; the food sustained the system at the level thus achieved . The perilous moment was over . “
139166	139196	139087	139087	She	2864	” cried Algitha , when the patient 's safety was assured , and she sank back on the pillow , with a look of relief on her worn face . “
139215	139256	139257	139257	I	0	” Algitha rushed forward , and the nurse dragged up a chair . Hadria had turned deadly white , and her hand groped for support . She drew herself together with a desperate effort , and sat down breathing quickly . “
139264	139270	139257	139257	I	0	” she said , reassuringly . “
139278	139284	139257	139257	I	0	” She gave a shudder . “
139298	139315	139291	139291	We	2867	” A low voice came from the bed . The patient was talking in her sleep . “
139345	139352	139343	139343	her	211	” Then , after a pause , “
139378	139408	139374	139374	they	667	” And then came a low moaning cry , terrible to hear . The sisters were by the bedside , in a moment . Their father stood behind them . “
139423	139439	139416	139416	we	2871	” Hadria murmured , with trembling voice . Algitha touched the thin hand , quietly . “
139447	139451	139445	139445	mother	3851	” she repeated . “
139467	139479	139483	139483	both	2874	” The sick woman seemed to be soothed by the words . “
139485	139525	139483	139483	both	2874	” she muttered vaguely . And then a smile spread over the sharpened features ; she opened her eyes and looked wistfully at the two faces bending over her . A look of happiness came into her dimmed eyes . “
139529	139537	139483	139483	both	2874	” she said in a dreamy voice , “
139553	139569	139538	139539	my girls	2875	” Then her eyes closed , and she fell into a profound and peaceful slumber . “
139592	139593	139594	139594	I	0	” “
139631	139869	139870	139870	I	0	” Mrs. Fullerton had always been an active woman , in spite of not being very robust , and a life passed on a couch had peculiar terrors for her . The nervous system had been wrecked , not by any one shock or event , but by the accumulated strains of a lifetime . The constitution was broken up , once and for all . A cottage had been taken , as near as possible to the Red House , where the old couple were to settle for the rest of their days , within reach of their children and grandchildren . Every wish of the invalid must be respected , just or unjust . Absolute repose of mind and body was imperatively necessary , and this could only be attained for her by a complete surrender , on the part of her children , of any course of action that she seriously disapproved . The income was too limited to allow of Algitha 's returning to her parents ; otherwise Mrs. Fullerton would have wished it . Algitha had now to provide for herself , as the allowance that her father had given her could not be continued . She had previously done her work for nothing , but now Mrs. Trevelyan , under whose care she had been living , offered her a paid post in a Convalescent Home in which she was interested . “
139875	139879	139881	139882	Mrs. Trevelyan	95	” said Algitha , “
139906	139930	139881	139882	Mrs. Trevelyan	95	” Both Mr. and Mrs. Fullerton had taken it for granted that Hadria would remain at the Red House , and that Hubert would “
139932	140125	139881	139882	Mrs. Trevelyan	95	” her , as they put it . Circumstances seemed to take it equally for granted . Mrs. Fullerton would now depend entirely on her children for every solace and pleasure . She would require cheering , amusing , helping , in a thousand ways . Algitha was to come down each week from Saturday till Monday , and the brothers when they could . During the rest of the week , the invalid would depend on her younger daughter . Hadria 's leaving home , and the rumour of a quarrel between her and Hubert , had conduced to her mother 's illness , perhaps had even caused it . Mrs. Fullerton had taken it bitterly to heart . It had become obvious that Hadria would have now to remain at the Red House , for her mother 's sake , and that being so , she and Hubert agreed that it was useless to discuss any other reasons for and against it . Hubert was only too glad of her return , for appearance ' sake . Neither of them thought , for a moment , of what Henriette called a “
140128	140402	139881	139882	Mrs. Trevelyan	95	” What had passed before Hadria 's departure had revealed finally , the hopelessness of such an attempt . Matters settled down heavily and with an air of finality . If only her mother 's declining years were happy and peaceful , that would be something of importance gained , but , alas ! Mrs. Fullerton seemed anything but happy . Her helplessness was hard to bear , and she felt the worldly downfall , severely . All this , and the shattered state of her nerves tended to make her exacting and irritable ; and as she had felt seriously aggrieved for so many years of her life , she now regarded the devotion of her children as a debt tardily paid , and the habit grew insensibly upon her of increasing her demands , as she found everyone so ready to submit to them . The possession of power had its usual effect . She knew no mercy in its use . Her daughters were made to feel that if they had been less headstrong and selfish in the past , she would have been a vigorous and active woman to this day . Obviously , the very least they could do , was to try by all means in their power , to lighten the burden they had laid upon her . Yet Mrs. Fullerton was , by nature , unselfish . She would have gladly sacrificed herself for her children 's good , as indeed she had persistently and doggedly sacrificed herself for them , during their childhood , but naturally she had her own view of what constituted their “
140405	140840	139881	139882	Mrs. Trevelyan	95	” It did not consist in wasting one 's youth and looks among the slums of the East End , or in deserting one 's home to study music and mix in a set of second - rate people , in an out - of - the - way district of Paris . As for Hadria 's conduct about little Martha , Mrs. Fullerton could scarcely bring herself to speak about it . It terrified her . She thought it indicated some taint of madness in her daughter 's mind . Two charming children of her own and — but Mrs. Fullerton , with a painful flush , would turn her mind from the subject . She had to believe her daughter either mad or bad , and that was terrible to her maternal pride . She could indeed scarcely believe that it had not all been a painful dream , for Hadria was now so good and dutiful , so tender and watchful ; how could she have behaved so abominably , so crazily ? Every day Hadria came to the cottage , generally with a bunch of fresh flowers to place by her mother 's couch , and then all the affairs of the household were talked over and arranged , the daughter doing what was needed in the way of ordering provisions or writing notes , for the invalid could now write only with the greatest difficulty . Then Mrs. Fullerton liked to have a chat , to hear what was in the papers , what was going on in the neighbourhood , and to discuss all sorts of dreary details , over and over again . Books that Hadria would sometimes bring were generally left unread , unless they were light novels of a rigidly conventional character . Mrs. Fullerton grew so excited in her condemnation of any other kind , that it was dangerous to put them before her . In the evenings , the old couple liked to have a rubber , and often Hubert and Hadria would make up the necessary quartett ; four silent human beings , who sat like solemn children at their portentous play , while the clock on the mantelpiece recorded the moments of their lives that they dedicated to the mimic battle . Hours and hours were spent in this way . But Hadria found that she could not endure it every night , much to the surprise of her parents . The monotony , the incessant recurrence , had a disastrous effect on her nerves , suggesting wild and desperate impulses . “
140855	140868	140850	140850	I	0	” she said at last , after trying it for some months . “
140899	141107	140885	140885	He	2883	” Mrs. Fullerton thought it strange that Hadria could not do even this little thing for her parents , without grumbling , but she did not wish to make a martyr of her . They must try and find some one else to take her place occasionally . Sometimes Joseph Fleming would accept the post , sometimes Lord Engleton , and often Ernest or Fred , whose comparatively well - ordered minds were not sent off their balance so easily as Hadria 's . In this fashion , the time went by , and the new state of affairs already seemed a hundred years old . Paris was a clear , but far - off dream . An occasional letter from Madame Vauchelet or Jouffroy , who mourned and wailed over Hadria 's surrender of her work , served to remind her that it had once been actual and living . There still existed a Paris far away beyond the hills , brilliant , vivid , exquisite , inspiring , and at this very moment the people were coming and going , the river was flowing , the little steamers plying,—but how hard it was to realise ! The family was charmed with the position of affairs . “
141120	141133	141117	141117	they	2884	” was the verdict , delivered with much wise shaking of heads . “
141173	141497	141156	141156	She	2885	” From the first , Hadria had understood what the future must be . These circumstances could not be overcome by any deed that she could bring herself to do . Even Valeria was baffled . Her theories would not quite work . Hadria looked things straight in the face . That which was strongest and most essential in her must starve ; there was no help for it , and no one was directly to blame , not even herself . Fate , chance , Providence , the devil , or whatever it was , had determined against her particular impulses and her particular view of things . After all , it would have been rather strange if these powers had happened exactly to agree with her . She was not so ridiculous ( she told herself ) as to feel personally aggrieved , but so long as fate , chance , Providence , or the devil , gave her emotions and desires and talent and will , it was impossible not to suffer . She might fully recognise that the suffering was of absolutely no importance in the great scheme of things , but that did not make the suffering less . If it must be , it must be , and there was an end to it . Should someone gain by it , that was highly satisfactory , and more than could be said of most suffering , which exists , it would seem , only to increase and multiply after the manner of some dire disease . This was what Hadria dreaded in her own case : that the loss would not end with her . The children , Martha , everyone who came under her influence , must share in it . Henriette irritated her by an approving sweetness of demeanour , carefully avoiding any look of triumph , or rather triumphing by that air which said : “
141508	141536	141498	141498	I	0	” She was evidently brimming over with satisfaction . A great peril , she felt , had been averted . The family and its reputation were saved . “
141553	141557	141537	141537	You	2889	” said Hadria ; “
141580	141581	141582	141582	One	329	” “
141589	141713	141586	141586	people	3687	” said Henriette . Hadria 's time now was filled more and more with detail , since there were two households instead of one to manage . The new charge was particularly difficult , because she had not a free hand . Without entirely abandoning her music , it had , perforce , to fall into abeyance . Progress was scarcely possible . But as Henriette pointed out — it gave so much pleasure to others — when Hadria avoided music that was too severely classical . At Craddock Place , one evening , she was taken in to dinner by a callow youth , who found a fertile subject for his wit , in the follies and excesses of what he called the “
141717	141855	141586	141586	people	3687	” It was so delightful , he said , to come to the country , where women were still charming in the good old way . He knew that this new womanhood business was only a phase , do n't you know , but upon his word , he was getting tired of it . Not that he had any objection to women being well educated ( Hadria was glad of that ) , but he could not stand it when they went out of their sphere , and put themselves forward and tried to be emancipated , and all that sort of nonsense . Hadria was not surprised that he could not stand it . There had been a scathing article , the youth said , in one of the evening papers . He wondered how the “
141858	141871	142120	142122	Mr. St. George	269	” felt after reading it ! It simply made mincemeat of her . “
141875	142055	142120	142122	Mr. St. George	269	” Hadria exclaimed . The youth wished that women would really do something , instead of making all this fuss . Hadria agreed that it was a pity they were so inactive . Could not one or two of the more favoured sex manage to inspire them with a little initiative ? The youth considered that women were , by nature , passive and reflective , not original . Hadria thought the novelty of that idea not the least of its charms . The youth allowed that , in her own way , and in her own sphere , woman was charming and singularly intelligent . He had no objection to her developing as much as she pleased , in proper directions . ( Hadria felt really encouraged . ) But it was so absurd to pretend that women could do work that was peculiar to men . ( Hadria agreed , with a chuckle . ) When had they written one of Shakespeare 's dramas ? ( When indeed ? History was ominously silent on that point . ) “
142063	142072	142056	142056	Hadria	211	” enquired her hostess , across the table . “
142102	142103	142086	142088	Mr. St. George	269	” “
142106	142115	142086	142088	Mr. St. George	269	” said Lady Engleton with a broad smile , “
142137	142349	142350	142350	I	0	” Perhaps not quite , as far as literature went , the youth admitted tolerantly , but there was failure in original work in every direction . This was no blame to women ; they were not made that way , but facts had to be recognised . Women 's strength lay in a different domain — in the home . It was of no use to try to fight against Nature . Look at music for instance ; one required no particular liberty to pursue that art , yet where were the women - composers ? If there was so much buried talent among women , why did n't they arise and bring out operas and oratorios ? Hadria could n't understand it ; especially as the domestic life was arranged , one might almost say , with a special view to promoting musical talent in the mistress of the household . Yet where were those oratorios ? She shook her head . Mr. St. George , she thought , had clearly proved that the inherent nature of women was passive and imitative , while that of man , even in the least remarkable examples of the sex , was always powerful and original to the verge of the perilous ! “
142362	142553	142350	142350	I	0	” said Lady Engleton , discreetly . The youth twirled his moustaches thoughtfully , as the ladies filed out . Hadria 's happiest hours were now those that she spent with little Martha , who was growing rapidly in stature and intelligence gence . The child 's lovable nature blossomed sweetly under the influence of Hadria 's tenderness . When wearied , and sad at heart , an hour in the Priory garden , or a saunter along the road - side with little Martha , was like the touch of a fresh breeze after the oppression of a heated room . Hadria 's attachment to the child had grown and grown , until it had become almost a passion . How was the child to be saved from the usual fate of womanhood ? Hadria often felt a thrill of terror , when the beautiful blue eyes looked out , large and fearless , into the world that was just unfolding before them , in its mysterious loveliness . The little girl gave promise of beauty . Even now there were elements that suggested a moving , attracting nature . “
142558	142562	142563	142564	a woman	3753	” thought Hadria , “
142576	142827	142570	142570	I	0	” Hadria had not seen Professor Fortescue since her return from Paris . She felt that he , and he alone , could give her courage , that he and he alone could save her from utter despondency . If only he would come ! For the first time in her life , she thought of writing to ask him for personal help and advice . Before she had carried out this idea , the news came that he was ill , that the doctor wished him to go abroad , but that he was forced to remain in England , for another three months , to complete some work , and to set some of his affairs in order . Hadria , in desperation , was thinking of throwing minor considerations to the winds , and going to see for herself the state of affairs ( it could be managed without her mother 's knowledge , and so would not endanger her health or life ) , when the two boys were sent back hastily from school , where scarlet fever had broken out . They must have caught the infection before leaving , for they were both taken ill . Valeria came down to Craddock Dene , for the day . She seemed almost distraught . Hadria could see her only at intervals . The sick children required all her attention . Valeria wished to visit them . She had brought the poor boys each a little gift . “
142835	142845	142829	142829	you	2900	” Hadria remonstrated . Valeria gave a scornful snort . “
142852	142853	142854	142854	I	0	” “
142894	142895	142885	142885	they	2903	” “
142921	142922	142907	142907	You	0	” “
143017	143035	143036	143036	I	0	” Hadria was silent . She felt that these words covered something more than their ostensible meaning . “
143044	143059	143062	143062	he	116	” said Valeria restlessly . Her face was flushed , and her eyes burnt . “
143065	143070	143062	143062	he	116	” said Hadria sadly . “
143079	143088	143062	143062	he	116	” Hadria gave a low , horrified exclamation . “
143097	143098	143104	143104	he	116	” “
143115	143156	143104	143104	he	116	” Valeria was crouching before the fire , with a look of blank despair . Hadria , pale to the lips , took her hand gently and held it between her own . Valeria 's eyes suddenly filled with tears . “
143202	143230	143231	143231	I	0	” Hadria , with a startled look , paused to consider , and then , stroking back the beautiful white hair with light touch , she said , “
143269	143270	143260	143260	you	109	” “
143369	143379	143380	143380	I	0	” Valeria went on with an outburst of energy , “
143452	143453	143433	143433	I	0	” “
143478	143479	143433	143433	I	0	” “
143489	143490	143433	143433	I	0	” “
143494	143554	143433	143433	I	0	” Hadria exclaimed . Anxiety about Professor Fortescue now made a gloomy background to the responsibilities of Hadria 's present life . Valeria 's occasional visits were its bright spots . She looked forward to them , with pathetic eagerness . The friendship became closer than it had ever been before , since Valeria had confided her sad secret . “
143563	143564	143559	143559	I	0	” “
143568	143573	143566	143566	me	0	” she repeated blankly . “
143628	143629	143634	143634	you	109	” “
143638	143642	143634	143634	you	109	” Valeria admitted . “
143653	143701	143634	143634	you	109	” The thought of what she had missed was beginning to take a hold upon Hadria . Her life was passing , passing , and the supreme gifts would never be hers . She must for ever stand outside , and be satisfied with shadows and echoes . “
143709	143716	143703	143703	you	109	” Valeria asked , one day . “
143724	143728	143717	143717	I	0	” Hadria replied . “
143852	143853	143888	143888	my	0	” “
143856	143864	143888	143888	my	0	” said Valeria after a long pause , “
143879	143880	143876	143876	you	109	” “
143969	143970	143952	143952	one	329	” “
143982	143986	143952	143952	one	329	” said Valeria . “
144020	144021	144024	144024	Hadria	211	” “
144032	144036	144024	144024	Hadria	211	” cried Valeria . “
144044	144090	144024	144024	Hadria	211	” Valeria shook her head . She had no belief in Hadria 's powers in that direction . Hopelessness was her nearest approach to that condition of cheerful acquiescence which , Hadria had herself said , profound faith or profound stupidity can perhaps equally inspire . “
144094	144098	144099	144099	you	211	” said Valeria , “
144118	144119	144112	144112	You	211	” “
144187	144188	144200	144200	one	329	” “
144193	144197	144200	144200	one	329	” cried Valeria . “
144279	144280	144277	144277	Valeria	109	” “
144299	144304	144282	144282	you	2937	” exclaimed Mrs. Fullerton . “
144310	144325	144326	144326	You	2937	” The remark was made before the party settled to the evening 's whist . “
144344	144382	144341	144342	Mrs. Fullerton	97	” said Joseph Fleming , who was to take a hand , while Hadria played Grieg or Chopin , or Scottish melodies to please the old people . The whist - players enjoyed music during the game . “
144391	144396	144385	144385	I	0	” said Mrs. Fullerton . “
144414	144510	144405	144406	Mr. Fleming	159	” It was a quaint , low - pitched little room , filled with familiar furniture from Dunaghee , which recalled the old place at every turn . The game went on in silence . The cards were dealt , taken up , shuffled , sorted , played , massed together , cut , dealt , sorted , and so on , round and round ; four grave faces deeply engrossed in the process , while the little room was filled with music . Mrs. Fullerton had begun to feel slightly uneasy about her daughter . “
144519	145197	144405	144406	Mr. Fleming	159	” said everyone . The illness of the two boys had come at an unfortunate moment . She looked worn and white , and dreadfully thin . She seemed cheerful , and at times her mood was even merry , but she could not recover strength . At the end of the day , she would be completely exhausted . This had not been surprising at first , after the long strain of nursing , but Mrs. Fullerton thought it was time that she began to mend . She feared that Hadria spent too many hours over her composing ; she sat up at night , perhaps . What good did all this composing do ? Nobody ever heard of it . Such a sad pity that she could not see the folly of persevering in the fruitless effort . Lady Engleton was sure that Hadria saw too few people , lived too monotonous a life . Craddock Place was filled with guests just now , and Lady Engleton used her utmost persuasion to induce Hubert and Hadria to come to dinner , or to join the party , in the evening , whenever they could . Hadria shrank from the idea . It was adding another burden to her already failing strength . To talk coherently , to be lively and make oneself agreeable , to have to think about one 's dress,—it all seemed inexpressibly wearisome . But Lady Engleton was so genuinely eager to administer her cure that Hadria yielded , half in gratitude , half in order to save the effort of further resistance . She dragged herself upstairs to dress , wishing to heaven she had refused , after all . The thought of the lights , the sound of voices , the complexity of elements and of life that she had to encounter , made her shrink into herself . She had only one evening gown suitable for the occasion . It was of some white silken stuff , with dull rich surface . A bunch of yellow roses and green leaves formed the decoration . Hubert approved of her appearance . To her own surprise she felt some new feeling creep into her , under the influence of the exquisite attire . It put her a little more in tune . At least there were beautiful and dainty things in the world . The fresh green of the rose leaves , and the full yet delicate yellow of the fragrant roses on the creamy lace , evoked a feeling akin to the emotion stirred by certain kinds of music ; or , in other words , the artistic sensibility had been appealed to through colour and texture , instead of through harmony . The drawing - room at Craddock Place was glowing with subdued candle - light . Lady Engleton 's rooms carried one back to a past epoch , among the dainty fancies and art of a sore leisurely and less vulgar century . Lady Engleton admitted nothing that had not the quality of distinction , let have what other quality it might . Hadria 's mood , initiated at home , received impetus at Craddock Place . It was a luxurious mood . She desired to receive rather than to give : to be delicately ministered to ; to claim the services of generations of artists , who had toiled with fervour to attain that grand ease and simplicity , through faithful labour and the benison of heaven . Hadria had attracted many eyes as she entered the room . Unquestionably she was looking her best to - night , in spite of her extreme pallor . She was worthy to take her place among the beautiful objects of art that Lady Engleton had collected found her . She had the same quality . Hubert vaguely perceived this . He heard the idea expressed in so many words by a voice that he knew . He looked round , and saw Professor Theobald bending confidentially towards Joseph Fleming . “
145215	145216	145200	145200	Professor	1240	” “
145230	145235	145236	145236	I	0	” asked the Professor . “
145249	145253	145236	145236	I	0	” returned Hubert ; “
145275	145324	145265	145265	you	1240	” Theobald gave some fantastic answer , and crossed the room to Mrs. Temperley , who was by this time surrounded by a group of acquaintances , among them Madame Bertaux , who had just come from Paris , and had news of all Hadria 's friends there . “
145339	145356	145325	145326	Mrs. Temperley	154	” Hadria turned round with a little start , and a sudden unaccountable sense of disaster . “
145360	145415	145357	145358	Professor Theobald	181	” She did not look pleased to see him , and as they shook hands , his mouth shut sharply , as it always did when his self- love was wounded . Then , a gleam of resolve or cunning came into his face , and the next instant he was at his suavest . “
145451	145456	145446	145446	I	0	” Hadria smiled maliciously . “
145465	145472	145457	145457	You	181	” Professor Theobald began to chuckle . “
145484	145488	145481	145481	your	154	” she added , “
145510	145511	145508	145508	Professor	1240	” “
145528	145529	145525	145526	Mrs. Temperley	154	” “
145537	145541	145530	145530	You	154	” she answered ; “
145547	145582	145530	145530	You	154	” A few introductory chords sounded through the room . Hadria was sitting in front of the window , across which the pale green curtains had been drawn . Many eyes wandered towards her . “
145593	145598	145599	145599	you	154	” murmured Lady Engleton ; “
145616	145634	145609	145609	you	154	” A cousin of Lord Engleton was at the piano . He played an old French gavotte . “
145641	145650	145609	145609	you	154	” added Lady Engleton , below her breath . “
145668	145716	145661	145662	Claude Moreton	178	” The performance was received with enthusiasm . It deepened Hadria 's mood , set her pulses dancing . She assented readily to the request of her hostess that she should play . She chose something fantastic and dainty . It had a certain remoteness from life . “
145724	146012	145661	145662	Claude Moreton	178	” said Claude Moreton , who was hanging over the piano . He was tall and dark , with an expression that betrayed his enthusiastic temperament . A group had collected , among them Professor Theobald . Beside him stood Marion Fenwick , the bride whose wedding had taken place at Craddock Church about eighteen months before . It seemed as if Hadria were exercising some influence of a magnetic quality . She was always the point of attraction , whether she created a spell with her music , or her speech , or her mere personality . In her present mood , this was peculiarly gratifying . The long divorce from initiative work which events had compelled , the loss of nervous vigour , the destruction of dream and hope , had all tended to throw her back on more accessible forms of art and expression , and suggested passive rather than active dealings with life . She was wearied with petty responsibilities , and what she called semi - detached duties . It was a relief to sit down in white silk and lace , and draw people to her simply by the cheap spell of good looks and personal magnetism . That she possessed these advantages , her life in Paris had made obvious . It was the first time that she had been in contact with a large number of widely differing types , and she had found that she could appeal to them all , if she would . Since her return to England , anxieties and influences extremely depressing had accustomed her to a somewhat gloomy atmosphere . To - night the atmosphere was light and soft , brilliant and enervating . “
146018	146428	146015	146015	my	0	” she said laughingly , to her hostess . It invited every luxurious instinct to come forth and sun itself . Marion Fenwick 's soft , sweet voice , singing Italian songs to the accompaniment of the guitar , repeated the invitation . It was like a fairy gift . Energy would be required to refuse it . And why , in heaven 's name , if she might not have what she really wanted , was she to be denied even the poor little triumphs of ornamental womanhood ? Was the social order which had frustrated her own ambitions to dominate her conscience , and persuade her voluntarily to resign that one kingdom which can not be taken from a woman , so long as her beauty lasts ? Why should she abdicate ? The human being was obviously susceptible to personality beyond all other things . And beauty moved that absurd creature preposterously . There , at least , the woman who chanced to be born with these superficial attractions , had a royal territory , so long as she could prevent her clamorous fellows from harassing and wearing those attractions away . By no direct attack could the jealous powers dethrone her . They could only do it indirectly , by appealing to the conscience which they had trained ; to the principles that they had instilled ; by convincing the woman that she owed herself , as a debt , to her legal owner , to be paid in coined fragments of her being , till she should end in inevitable bankruptcy , and the legal owner himself found her a poor investment ! It would have startled that roomful of people , who expressed everything circuitously , pleasantly , without rough edges , had they read beneath Mrs. Temperley 's spoken words , these unspoken thoughts . Marion Fenwick 's songs and the alluring softness of her guitar , seemed the most fitting accompaniment to the warm summer night , whose breath stirred gently the curtains by the open window , at the far end of the room . Lady Engleton was delighted with the success of her efforts . Mrs. Temperley had not looked so brilliant , so full of life , since her mother 's illness . Only yesterday , when she met her returning from the Cottage , her eyes were like those of a dying woman , and now — ! “
146439	146447	146429	146429	People	3687	” she confided to an intimate friend , “
146458	146654	146452	146452	they	3687	” People might have been forgiven for not understanding her , as perhaps her hostess felt , noticing Hadria 's animation , and the extraordinary power that she was wielding over everyone in the room , young and old . That power seemed to burn in the deep eyes , whose expression changed from moment to moment . Hadria 's cheeks , for once , had a faint tinge of colour . The mysterious character of her beauty became more marked . Professor Theobald followed her , with admiring and studious gaze . Whether she had felt remorseful for her somewhat unfriendly greeting at the beginning of the evening , or from some other cause , her manner to him had changed . It was softer , less mocking . He perceived it instantly , and pursued his advantage . The party still centred eagerly round the piano . Hadria was under the influence of music ; therefore less careful and guarded than usual , more ready to sway on the waves of emotion . And beyond all these influences , tending in the same direction , was the underlying spirit of rebellion against the everlasting “
146658	146793	146794	146794	They	2949	” that met a woman at every point , and turned her back from all paths save one . And following that one ( so ran Hadria 's insurrectionary thoughts ) , the obedient creature had to give up every weapon of her womanhood ; every grace , every power ; tramping along that crowded highway , whereon wayworn sisters toil forward , with bandaged eyes , and bleeding feet ; and as their charm fades , in the pursuing of their dusty pilgrimage , the shouts , and taunts , and insults , and laughter of their taskmasters follow them , while still they stumble on to the darkening land that awaits them , at the journey 's end : Old Age , the vestibule of Death . Hadria 's eyes gleamed strangely . “
146832	146857	146858	146858	My	0	” The only person who seemed to resist Hadria 's influence to - night , was Mrs. Jordan , the mother of Marion Fenwick . “
146862	146876	146858	146858	My	0	” said Professor Theobald , bending over the portly form of Mrs. Jordan , “
146887	146888	146858	146858	My	0	” “
146897	146901	146895	146895	Professor	1240	” said Hadria , “
146921	146922	146915	146915	You	1240	” “
146933	146938	146915	146915	You	1240	” he said emphatically . “
146952	147274	146941	146941	your	2952	” prompted Madame Bertaux maliciously . Mrs. Jordan delivered herself of various immemorial sentiments which met the usual applause . But Madame Bertaux said brusquely that she thought if that sort of thing were preached at women much longer , they would end by throwing over duty altogether , in sheer disgust at the whole one - sided business . Mrs. Jordan bristled , and launched herself upon a long and virtuous sentence . Her daughter Marion looked up sharply when Madame Bertaux spoke . Then a timid , cautious glance fell on her mother . Marion had lost her freshness and her exquisite ætherial quality ; otherwise there was little change in her appearance . Hadria was struck by the way in which she had looked at Madame Bertaux , and it occurred to her that Marion Fenwick was probably not quite so acquiescent and satisfied as her friends supposed . But she would not speak out . Early training had been too strong for her . Professor Theobald was unusually serious to - night . He did not respond to Hadria 's flippancy . He looked at her with grave , sympathetic eyes . He seemed to intimate that he understood all that was passing in her mind , and was not balked by sprightly appearances . There was no sign of cynicism now , no bandying of compliments . His voice had a new ring of sincerity . It was a mood that Hadria had noticed in him once or twice before , and when it occurred , her sympathy was aroused ; she felt that she had done him injustice . This was evidently the real man ; his ordinary manner must be merely the cloak that the civilized being acquires the habit of wrapping round him , as a protection against the curiosity of his fellows . The Professor himself expressed it almost in those words : “
147369	147403	147411	147411	one	329	” The conversation took more and more intimate and serious turns . Mrs. Jordan was the only check upon it . Madame Bertaux followed up her first heresy by others even more bold . “
147418	147422	147423	147423	one	329	” she said , “
147486	147487	147463	147463	one	329	” “
147493	147513	147463	147463	one	329	” said Mrs. Jordan , who had ruled her family with a rod of iron for thirty stern years , “
147526	147527	147463	147463	one	329	” “
147534	147538	147463	147463	one	329	” added Hadria . “
147556	147561	147539	147539	I	0	” said Madame Bertaux . “
147578	147579	147574	147574	we	2959	” “
147585	147590	147574	147574	we	2959	” cried Professor Theobald . “
147650	147697	147647	147648	any Christian	2972	” The party broke up , with many cordial expressions of pleasure , and several plans were made for immediately meeting again . Lady Engleton was delighted to see that Mrs. Temperley entered with animation , into some projects for picnics and excursions in the neighbourhood . “
147713	147746	147699	147699	I	0	” she said , with genuine warmth , as the two women stood in the hall , a little apart from the others . Hadria 's eyelids suddenly fell and reddened slightly . “
147754	147830	147749	147749	you	2973	” she exclaimed , in a voice whose tones betrayed the presence of suppressed tears . Lady Engleton , in astonishment , stretched out a sisterly hand , but Hadria had vanished through the open hall door into the darkness without . MRS . TEMPERLEY was much discussed at Craddock Place . Professor Theobald preserved the same grave mood whenever she was present . He only returned to his usual manner , in her absence . “
147839	147854	147749	147749	you	2973	” Claude Moreton used to say . The latter was himself among her admirers . “
147868	147914	147861	147861	Claude	178	” Lady Engleton remarked to her husband . He had fired up on one occasion when Professor Theobald said something flippant about Mrs. Temperley . Claude Moreton 's usual calmness had caused the sudden outburst to be noticed with surprise . He hated Professor Theobald . “
147928	147929	147930	147931	The Professor	4071	” “
147958	147963	147949	147949	One	329	” Claude Moreton grunted . “
147983	147984	147974	147975	Mrs. Temperley	154	” “
148011	148485	148005	148005	he	4071	” The special manner had already worked wonders . The Professor was to Hadria by far the most entertaining person of the party . He had always amused her , and even the first time she saw him , he had exercised a strange , unpleasant fascination over her , which had put her on the defensive , for she had disliked and distrusted him . The meetings in the Priory gardens had softened her hostility , and now she began to feel more and more that she had judged him unfairly . In those days she had a strong pre - occupying interest . He had arrived on the scene at an exciting moment , just when she was planning out her flight to Paris . She had not considered the Professor 's character very deeply . There were far too many other things to think of . It was simpler to avoid him . But now everything had changed . The present moment was not exciting ; she had no plans and projects in her head ; she was not about to court the fate of Icarus . That fate had already overtaken her . The waves were closing over - head ; her wings were wet and crippled , in the blue depths . Why not take what the gods had sent and make the most of it ? The Professor had all sorts of strange lore , which he used , in his conversations with Hadria , almost as a fisherman uses his bait . If she shewed an inclination to re - join the rest of the party , he always brought out some fresh titbit of curious learning , and Hadria was seldom able to resist the lure . They met often , almost of necessity . It was impossible to feel a stranger to the Professor , in these circumstances of frequent and informal meeting . Often when Hadria happened to be alone with him , she would become suddenly silent , as if she no longer felt the necessity to talk or to conceal her weariness . The Professor knew it too well ; he saw how heavily the burden of life weighed upon her , and how it was often almost more than she could do , to drag through the day . She craved for excitement , no matter of what kind , in order to help her to forget her weariness . Her anxiety about Professor Fortescue preyed upon her . She was restless , overwrought , with every nerve on edge , unable now for consecutive work , even had events permitted it . She followed the advice and took the medicines of a London doctor , whom Mrs. Fullerton had entreated her to consult , but she gained no ground . “
148499	148525	148486	148486	I	0	” she said to Algitha , who used to bemoan this vice , with its terrible results , of which she had seen so much . “
148538	148542	148486	148486	I	0	” cried Algitha . “
148580	148581	148566	148566	they	3687	” “
148600	148604	148605	148605	I	0	” returned Hadria . “

148696	148731	148689	148689	you	211	” Hadria looked steadily into the flames . They were in the morning - room , where towards night - fall , even in summer , a small fire usually burnt in the grate . “
148790	148791	148767	148767	Hadria	211	” “
148797	148801	148767	148767	Hadria	211	” cried Hadria , “
148808	148809	148810	148810	You	0	” “
148816	148817	148810	148810	You	0	” “

149069	149074	149063	149063	you	211	” the sister exclaimed . “

149265	149266	149270	149270	I	0	” “
149376	149408	149371	149371	one	329	” Algitha 's remonstrance seemed only to inflame her sister 's mood , so she said no more . But she watched Hadria 's increasingly reckless conduct , with great uneasiness . “
149414	149493	149371	149371	one	329	” exclaimed Hadria , with a strange smile . The whole party had migrated for the day , to the hills at a distance of about ten miles from Craddock Dene . A high spot had been chosen , on the edge of woodland shade , looking out over a wide distance of plain and far - off ranges . Here , as Claude Moreton remarked , they were to spoil the landscape , by taking their luncheon . “
149504	149509	149371	149371	one	329	” added Lord Engleton . “
149516	149521	149371	149371	one	329	” exclaimed his wife , “
149554	149555	149556	149556	We	3006	” “
149574	149579	149661	149661	you	3009	” said Claude Moreton . “
149587	149596	149661	149661	you	3009	” advised Algitha , with characteristic common sense . “
149605	149606	149661	149661	you	3009	” “
149616	149621	149610	149610	you	3009	” cried Professor Theobald . “
149632	149641	149610	149610	you	3009	” He spread the waterproof to the wind . “
149650	149655	149610	149610	you	3009	” cried Lady Engleton . “
149687	149691	149671	149671	you	3009	” asked Hadria . “
149698	149782	149783	149784	Mrs. Fenwick	275	” said Claude Moreton , dreamily . At the end of the meal , Hadria rose from the rug where she had been reclining , with the final assertion , that she thought the man who was knocked into the ditch and told to do his duty there , would do the best service to mankind , as well as to himself , by making a horrid clamour and trying to get out again . A group collected round her , almost immediately . “
149794	149799	149783	149784	Mrs. Fenwick	275	” cried Madame Bertaux . “
149812	150139	149802	149802	you	275	” Marion was enthroned upon the picnic - basket , with much pomp , and her guitar placed in her hand by Claude Moreton . Her figure , in her white gown and large straw hat , had for background the shadows of thick woods . Professor Theobald sank down on the grass at Hadria 's side . She felt that his mood was agitated . She could not be in much doubt as to its cause . The reckless rôle that she had been playing was bringing its result . Hadria was half alarmed , half exultant . She had a strange , vague notion of selling her life dearly , to the enemy . Only , of late , this feeling had been mixed with another , of which she was scarcely conscious . The subtle fascination which the Professor exercised over her had taken a stronger hold , far stronger than she knew . She was sitting on a little knoll , her arm resting on her knee , and her cheek in her hand . In the exquisitely graceful attitude , was an element of self - abandonment . It seemed as if she had grown tired of guiding and directing herself , and were now commending herself to fate or fortune , to do with her as they would , or must . Marion struck a quiet chord . Her voice was sweet and tender and full , admirably suited to the song . Every nerve in Hadria answered to her tones . Professor Theobald shifted his position slightly . The song was greeted with a vague stir among the silent audience . A little breeze gave a deep satisfied sigh , among the trees . Several other songs followed , and then the party broke up . They were to amuse themselves as they pleased during the afternoon , and to meet on the same spot for five o'clock tea . “
150149	150154	150142	150142	Hadria	211	” cried Algitha anxiously . “
150161	150162	150156	150156	you	0	” “
150169	150173	150174	150174	she	211	” said Valeria , “

150281	150287	150264	150265	A man	3704	” said Miss Du Prel . “
150316	150320	150298	150298	her	211	” said Algitha . “
150355	150363	150365	150365	Hadria	211	” Algitha shook her head , regretfully . “
150372	150373	150365	150365	Hadria	211	” “
150388	150389	150383	150383	her	211	” “
150399	150406	150390	150390	I	0	” said Miss Du Prel reflectively . “
150423	150424	150407	150407	She	211	” “
150472	150473	150466	150466	she	211	” “

150562	150566	150559	150559	I	0	” Algitha admitted . “

150689	150695	150696	150696	She	211	” said Miss Du Prel . “
150735	150894	150896	150897	the man	3754	” Miss Du Prel had never shewn so much disposition to support Hadria 's conduct as now , when disapproval was general . She had a strong fellow - feeling for a woman who desired to use her power , and she was half disposed to regard her conduct as legitimate . At any rate , it was a temptation almost beyond one 's powers of resistance . If a woman might not do this , what , in heaven 's name , might she do ? Was she not eternally referred to her woman 's influence , her woman 's kingdom ? Surely a day 's somewhat murderous sport was allowable in that realm ! After all , energy , ambition , nervous force , must have an outlet somewhere . Men could look after themselves . They had no mercy on women when they lay in their power . Why should a woman be so punctilious ? “
150907	150913	150914	150914	He	3754	” she added , bitterly . “
150937	150958	150914	150914	He	3754	” Unexpectedly , the underwood behind the speakers was brushed aside and Hadria appeared before them . She looked perturbed . “
150969	150970	150914	150914	He	3754	” “
151011	151023	151042	151042	you	3027	” Hadria stood before them , in an attitude of hauteur . “
151029	151033	151042	151042	you	3027	” said Algitha . “
151056	151057	151042	151042	you	3027	” “
151060	151065	151042	151042	you	3027	” said her sister ; “

151085	151114	151078	151078	I	0	” she said , walking away . Hadria sat down and rested one elbow on the grass , looking over the sweep of the hill towards the distance . “
151153	151154	151139	151139	You	3027	” “
151159	151160	151156	151156	you	3027	” “

151218	151225	151241	151243	some accredited sage	3040	” Algitha shook her head anxiously . “
151245	151249	151241	151243	some accredited sage	3040	” Hadria observed . “
151257	151261	151250	151250	Women	606	” said Algitha . “
151277	151278	151282	151282	Hadria	211	” “
151341	151346	151347	151347	I	0	” Hadria flushed deeply . “
151365	151366	151355	151355	I	0	” “
151406	151411	151384	151386	Miss Du Prel	109	” Hadria was silent . “
151416	151421	151422	151422	He	178	” continued Algitha presently . “
151450	151455	151444	151444	him	178	” Hadria grew fierce . “
151557	151558	151549	151549	Their	3698	” “
151570	151584	151585	151585	I	0	” asked Algitha , sticking persistently to the practical side of the matter . “
151651	151652	151653	151653	You	211	” “
151693	151699	151700	151700	I	0	” Hadria 's eyes sparkled . “
151708	151712	151713	151713	I	0	” she exclaimed . “
151790	151791	151783	151783	I	0	” “
151822	151823	151824	151824	I	0	” “
151837	151940	151826	151826	I	0	” cried Hadria passionately . IN the conversation with her sister , the name which Hadria had dreaded to hear had not been mentioned . She felt as if she could not have met her sister 's eyes , at that moment , had she alluded to Professor Theobald ; for only five minutes before , in the wood , he had spoken to her in a way that was scarcely possible to misunderstand , though his wording was so cautious that she could not have taken offence , had she been so minded , without drawing upon herself the possible retort . “
151951	153850	151945	151945	you	3062	” The thought made her flush painfully . But suppose he really had meant what his words seemed to imply ? He could intend no insult , because he despised , and knew that she despised , popular social creeds . Into what new realms was she drifting ? There was something attractive to Hadria , in the idea of defying the world 's laws . It was not as the dutiful property of another , but as herself , a separate and responsible individual , that she would act and feel , rightly or wrongly , as the case might be . That was a matter between herself and her conscience , not between herself and the world or her legal owner . The Professor 's ambiguous and yet startling speech had forced her to consider her position . She remembered how her instinct had always been to hold him aloof from her life , just because , as she now began to believe , there was something in him that powerfully attracted her . She had feared an attraction that appeared unjustified by the man 's character . But now the fascination had begun to take a stronger grip , as the pre - occupying ideas of her life had been chased from their places . It had insensibly crept in to fill the empty throne . So long as she had cherished hope , so long as she was still struggling , this insidious half - magnetic influence had been easily resisted . Now , she was set adrift ; her anchor was raised ; she lay at the wind 's mercy , half - conscious of the peril and not caring . Professor Theobald had an acute perception of the strange and confused struggle that was going on in her mind . But he had no notion of the peculiar reasons , in her case , for an effect that he knew to be far from rare among women ; he did not understand the angry , corroding action of a strong artistic impulse that was incessantly baulked in full tide . The sinister , menacing voices of that tide had no meaning for him , except as expressing a malaise which he had met with a hundred times before . He put it down to an excess of emotional or nervous energy , in a nature whose opportunities did not offer full scope to its powers . He had grasped the general conditions , but he had not perceived the particular fact that added tenfold to the evil which exists in the more usual , and less complicated case . He thought but little of a musical gift , having no sympathy with music ; and since he had never known what it was to receive anything but help and encouragement in the exercise of his own talents , the effect upon the mind and character of such an experience as Hadria 's , was beyond the range of his conceptions . He understood subtly , and misunderstood completely , at one and the same time . But to Hadria , every syllable which revealed how much he did understand , seemed to prove , by implication , that he understood the whole . It never occurred to her that he was blinder than Henriette herself , to the real centre and heart of the difficulty . It has been said that what the human being longs for above all things , is to be understood : that he prefers it infinitely to being over - rated . Professor Theobald gave Hadria this desired sensation . His attraction for her was composed of many elements , and it was enhanced by the fact that she had now grown so used to his presence , as to cease to notice many little traits that had repelled her , at the beginning . Her critical instincts were lulled . Thus had come to pass that which is by no means an uncommon incident in human history : a toleration for and finally a strong attraction towards a nature that began by creating distrust , and even dislike . Hadria 's instinct now was to hunt up reasons for desiring the society of Professor Theobald , for the gladness that she felt at the prospect of seeing him . She wished to explain to herself how it was that he had become so prominent a figure in her life . It was surprising how rapidly and how completely he had taken a central position . Her feeling towards him , and her admiring affection for Professor Fortescue , were as different as night from day . She shrank from comparing the two emotions , because at the bottom of her heart , she felt how infinitely less fine and sound was this latter attachment , how infinitely less to be welcomed . If any one spoke disparagingly of Professor Theobald , Hadria 's instinct was to stand up for him , to find ingenious reasons for his words or his conduct that threw upon him the most favourable light , and her object was as much to persuade herself as to convince her interlocutor . What the Professor had said this afternoon , had brought her to a point whence she had to review all these changes and developments of her feeling . She puzzled herself profoundly . In remembering those few words , she was conscious of a little thrill of — not joy ( the word was too strong ) , but of something akin to it . She thought — and then laughed at herself — that it had a resemblance to the sensation that is caused to the mind by the suggestion of some new and entrancingly interesting idea — say about astronomy ! And if she consulted her mere wishes in the matter , apart from all other considerations , she would explore farther in this direction . Whether curiosity or sentiment actuated her , she could not detect . It would certainly be deeply exciting to find out what her own nature really was , and still more so to gain greater insight into his . Was this heartless , cold - blooded ? Or was it that she felt a lurking capacity for a feeling stronger than — or at any rate different from — any that she had hitherto felt ? This was a secret that she could not discover . Hadria gave a frightened start . Was she finding herself to be bad in a way that she had never suspected ? If she could but fully and completely escape from tradition , so that her judgment might be quite unhampered . Tradition seemed either to make human beings blindly submissive , or to tempt them to act out of an equally blind opposition to its canons . One could never be entirely independent . In her confusion , she longed to turn to some clear mind and sound conscience , not so much for advice , as in order to test the effect upon such a mind and conscience of the whole situation . Professor Fortescue was the only person upon whose judgment and feeling she could absolutely rely . What would he think of her ? His impression would be the best possible guide , for no one opposed more strongly than he did the vulgar notion of proprietary rights between husband and wife , no one asserted more absolutely the independence of the individual . Yet Hadria could not imagine that he would be anything but profoundly sorry , if he knew the recklessness of her feeling , and the nature of her sentiment for Professor Theobald . But then he did not know how she stood ; he did not know that the blue hopeful distance of life had disappeared ; that even the middle - distance had been cut off , and that the sticks and stones and details of a very speckly foreground now confronted her immovably . She would like to learn how many women of her temperament , placed in her position , would stop to enquire very closely into the right and wrong of the matter , when for a moment , a little avenue seemed on the point of opening , misty and blue , leading the eye to hidden perilous distances . And then Professor Theobald had , after all , many fine qualities . He was complex , and he had faults like the rest of us ; but the more one knew him , the more one felt his kindness of heart ( how good he was to little Martha ) , his readiness to help others , his breadth of view and his sympathy . These were not common qualities . He was a mall whom one could admire , despite certain traits that made one shrink a little , at times . These moreover had disappeared of late . They were accidental rather than intrinsic . It was a matter of daily observation that people catch superficial modes of thought and speech , just as they catch accent , or as women who have given no thought to the art of dress , sometimes misrepresent themselves , by adopting , unmodified , whatever happens to be in the fashion . Hadria had a wistful desire to be able to respect Professor Theobald without reserve , to believe in him thoroughly , to think him noble in calibre and fine in fibre . She had a vague idea that emphatic statement could conduce to making all this true . She had never met him alone since that day of the picnic , except for a few chance minutes , when he had expressed over again , rather in tone than in words , the sentiment before implied . Algitha and Miss Du Prel were relieved to see that Hadria had , after all , taken their advice . Without making any violent or obvious change in her conduct , she had ceased to cause her friends anxiety . Something in her manner had changed . Claude Moreton felt it instantly . He spoke of leaving Craddock Place , but he lingered on . The house had begun to empty . Lady Engleton wished to have some time to herself . She was painting a new picture . But Professor Theobald remained . Joseph Fleming went away to stay with his married sister . About this time Hubert had to go abroad to attend to some business matters of a serious and tedious character , connected with a law - suit in which he was professionally interested . From some instinct which Hadria found difficult to account for , she avoided meeting the Professor alone . Yet the whole interest of the day centred in the prospect of seeing him . If by chance , she missed him , she felt flat and dull , and found herself going over in her mind every detail of their last meeting . He had the art of making his most trifling remark interesting . Even his comments on the weather had a colour and quality of their own . Lady Engleton admired his lightness of touch . “
153870	153896	153857	153857	Professor	181	” she asked one day , when she met Hadria returning from the Priory with the two boys , whose holidays were not yet over . “
153921	153922	153911	153911	she	0	” “
153933	153937	153923	153923	He	181	” said Hadria . “
153945	153955	153938	153938	He	181	” cried Jack , opening round and envious eyes . “
153963	153968	153938	153938	He	181	” enquired Lady Engleton . “
153974	154391	153970	153970	Mary	128	” Jack returned . Hadria was pleased at the kindness which the act seemed to indicate . The doctor had ordered her to be in the open air as much as possible , and to take a walk every day . Sometimes she would walk with the boys , sometimes alone . In either case , the thought of Professor Theobald pursued her . She often grew wearied with it , but it could not be banished . If she saw a distant figure on the road , a little sick , excited stir of the heart , betrayed her suspicion that it might be he . She could not sincerely wish herself free from the strange infatuation , for the thought of life without it , troublesome and fatiguing though it was , seemed inexpressibly dull . It had taken the colour out of everything . It had altered the very face of nature , in her eyes . Her hope had been to escape loneliness , but with this preposterous secret , she was lonelier than she had ever been before . She could no longer make a confidante of herself . She was afraid of her own ridicule , her own blame , above all of finding herself confronted with some accusation against the Professor , some overpowering reason for thinking poorly of him . Whenever they met , she was in terror lest he should leave her no alternative . She often opened conversational channels by which he could escape his unknown peril , and she would hold her breath till it was over . She dreaded the cool - headed , ruthless critic , lurking within her own consciousness , who would hear of no ingenious explanations of words or conduct . But she would not admit to this dread — that would have been to admit everything . She had not the satisfaction of openly thinking the matter out , for the suspicion that so profoundly saddened her , must be kept scrupulously hidden . Hadria was filled with dismay when she dared to glance at the future . No wonder Valeria had warned her against playing with fire ! Was it always like this when people fell in love ? What a ridiculous , uncomfortable , outrageous thing it was ! How destructive to common sense and sanity and everything that kept life running on reasonable lines . A poor joke at best , and oh , how stale ! “
154403	154404	154393	154393	I	0	” “
154412	154495	154409	154410	Professor Theobald	181	” Before them stretched a woodland glade . The broad fronds of the bracken made bright patches of light where the sun caught them , and tall plants , such as hemlock and wild parsley , stood out , almost white against the shade ; the flies and midges moving round them in the warmth . At some distance behind , the sound of voices could be heard through the windings of the wood . There were snatches of song and laughter . “
154504	154505	154496	154496	Your	3070	” “
154513	154522	154496	154496	Your	3070	” she answered , with a nervous laugh . “
154570	154601	154602	154604	Even an actor	3074	” Professor Theobald waited for her reply , but she made none . He looked at her fixedly , eagerly . She could do nothing but walk on in silence . “
154686	154694	154679	154679	He	3074	” Hadria gave a murmur of assent . “
154744	154823	154826	154827	Mrs. Temperley	154	” Hadria cleared her throat ; the words would not come . A rebellious little nerve was twitching at her eye - lid . After all , what in heaven 's name was she to say ? It was too foolish to pretend to misunderstand ; for tone , look , manner all told the same story ; yet even now there was nothing absolutely definite to reply to , and her cleverness of retort had deserted her . “
154831	155055	154826	154827	Mrs. Temperley	154	” Professor Theobald had stopped short in the path , and then Hadria made some drowning effort to resist the force that she still feared . But it was in vain . She stood before him , paler even than usual , with her head held high , but eye - lids that drooped and lips that trembled . The movement of the leaves made faint quivering little shadows on her white gown , and stirred delicately over the lace at her throat . The emotion that possessed her , the mixture of joy and dismay and even terror , passed across her face , in the moment 's silence . The two figures stood opposite to one another ; Hadria drawing a little away , swayed slightly backward , the Professor eagerly bending forward . He was on the point of speaking , when there came floating through the wood , the sound of a woman 's voice singing . The voice was swiftly recognised by them both , and the song . Hadria 's eye - lids lifted for a second , and her breathing quickened . Professor Theobald advanced a step . Hadria drew back . The sweet cadence died away . A bird 's note took up the dropped thread of music . The Professor broke into passionate speech . “
155238	155239	155223	155223	Hadria,—what	278	” “
155247	155251	155223	155223	Hadria,—what	278	” she exclaimed . “
155287	155288	155279	155279	I	0	” “
155297	155393	155290	155290	you	3085	” he cried . Her instinct was to deny the truth , but there seemed to her something mean in concealment , especially if she were to blame , especially if those who respected tradition , and made it their guide and rule through thick and thin , in the very teeth of reason , were right after all , as it seemed to her , at this moment , that they were . If there were evil in this strange passion , let her at least acknowledge her share in it . Let her not “
155403	155420	155398	155398	she	3089	” Professor Theobald was watching her face , as for a verdict of life and death . “
155437	155749	155398	155398	she	3089	” She had raised her eyes for a moment , about to speak ; the words were stifled at their birth , for the next instant she was in his arms . Again came the voice of the singer , nearer this time . The song was hummed softly . THE need for vigilance over that hidden distrust was more peremptory now than ever . The confession once made , the die once cast , anything but complete faith and respect became intolerable . Outwardly , affairs seemed to run on very much as before . But Hadria could scarcely believe that she was living in the same world . The new fact walked before her , everywhere . She did not dare to examine it closely . She told herself that a great joy had come to her , or rather that she had taken the joy in spite of everything and everybody . She would order her affections exactly as she chose . If only she could leave Craddock Dene ! Hubert and her parents considered the opinion of the public as of more importance than anything else in life ; for her mother 's sake she was forced to acquiesce ; otherwise there was absolutely no reason why she and Hubert should live under the same roof . It was a mere ceremony kept up on account of others . That had been acknowledged by him in so many words . And a wretched , ridiculous , irksome ceremony it was for them both . Hadria refused now to meet Professor Theobald at the Cottage . His visits there , which had been timed to meet her , must be paid at a different hour . He remonstrated in vain . She shewed various other inconsistencies , as he called them . He used to laugh affectionately at her “
155754	156299	155398	155398	she	3089	” but said he cared nothing for these trifles , since he had her assurance that she loved him . How he had waited and longed for that ! How hopeless , how impossible it had seemed . He professed to have fallen in love at first sight . He even declared that Hadria had done the same , though in a different way , without knowing it . Her mind had resisted and , for the time , kept her feelings in abeyance . He had watched the struggle . Her heart , he rejoiced to believe , had responded to him from the beginning . By dint of repeating this very often , he had half convinced Hadria that it was so . She preferred to think that her feeling was of the long - standing and resistless kind . Sometimes she had intervals of reckless happiness , when all doubts were kept at bay , and the condition of belief that she assiduously cultivated , remained with her freely . She felt no secret tug at the tether . Professor Theobald would then be at his best ; grave , thoughtful , gentle , considerate , responsive to every mood . When they met at Craddock Place and elsewhere , Hadria suffered miseries of anxiety . She was terrified lest he should do or say something in bad taste , and that she would see her own impression confirmed on the faces of others . She put it to herself that she was afraid people would not understand him as she did . The history of his past life , as he had related it to her , appealed overpoweringly to all that was womanly and protective in her nature . He was emotional by temperament , but circumstance had doomed him to repression and solitude . This call on her sympathy did more than anything to set Hadria 's mind at rest . She gave a vast sigh when that feeling of confidence became confirmed . Life , then , need no longer be ridiculous ! Hard and cruel it might be , full of lost dreams , but at least there would be something in it that was perfect . This new emotional centre offered the human summun bonum : release from oneself . Hadria and the Professor met , one morning , in the gardens of the Priory . Hadria had been strolling down the yew avenue , her thoughts full of him , as usual . She reached the seat at the end where once Professor Fortescue had found her — centuries ago , it seemed to her now . How different was this meeting ! Professor Theobald came by the path through the thick shrubberies , behind the seat . There was a small space of grass at the back . Here he stood , bending over the seat , and though he was usually prudent , he did not even assure himself that no one was in sight , before drawing Hadria 's head gently back , and stooping to kiss her on the cheek , while he imprisoned a hand in each of his . She flushed , and looked hastily down the avenue . “
156314	156323	156309	156309	anyone	806	” she said , with a little shudder . “
156331	156353	156309	156309	anyone	806	” He stood leaning over the high back of the seat , looking down at his companion , with a smile . “
156358	156362	156355	156355	you	1662	” he said , “
156381	156429	156365	156365	I	0	” Hadria 's face fell . She hated him to go away , even for a short time she could not endure her own thoughts when his influence was withdrawn . His presence wrapped her in a state of dream , a false peace which she courted . “
156435	156449	156365	156365	I	0	” she cried , with a childish eagerness that was entirely unlike her , “
156454	156455	156365	156365	I	0	” “
156464	156475	156457	156457	you	1662	” he asked , with a deep flush of pleasure . “
156484	156665	156478	156478	I	0	” Her thoughts wandered off through strange by - ways . At times , they would pass some black cavernous entrance to unknown labyrinths , and the frightened thoughts would hurry by . Sometimes they would be led decorously along a smooth highway , pacing quietly ; sometimes they would rise to the sunlight and spread their wings , and then perhaps take sudden flight , like a flock of startled birds . Yes , he needed sympathy , and faith , and love . He had never had anyone to believe in him before . He had met with hardness and distrust all his life . She would trust him . He had conquered , step by step , his inimical conditions . He was lonely , unused to real affection . Let her try to make up for what he had lost . Let her forget herself and her own little woes , in the effort to fill his life with all that he had been forced to forego . ( An impish thought danced before her for a second—“Fine
156677	156728	156671	156671	you	3096	” ) If her love were worth anything , that must be her impulse . Let her beware of considering her own feelings , her own wishes and fears . If she loved , let it be fully and freely , generously and without reserve . That or nothing . ( “
156735	156741	156671	156671	you	3096	” jeered the imp . ) “
156756	156766	156753	156753	I	0	” the other self seemed to cry in desperation . “
156773	156788	156753	156753	I	0	” said the Professor , taking her hand and holding it closely in his , “
156916	156917	156888	156888	Hadria	211	” “
156928	156947	156888	156888	Hadria	211	” The words danced in her head , like circles of little sprites carrying alluring wreaths of roses . “
156961	156997	156888	156888	Hadria	211	” she said . He began to plead , eloquently and skilfully . He knew exactly what arguments would tell best with her . The imps and the other selves engaged in a free fight . “
157042	157043	157035	157035	I	0	” “
157050	157054	157035	157035	I	0	” he argued . “

157248	157252	157273	157273	it	3113	” said Hadria . “
157300	157301	157287	157287	he	3112	” “
157321	157322	157311	157311	Hadria	211	” “
157331	157332	157311	157311	Hadria	211	” “

157385	157389	157390	157390	I	0	” Hadria laughed . “
157422	157423	157424	157424	I	0	” “
157443	157452	157453	157453	He	3122	” said the Professor , with a shrug . “
157459	157464	157456	157457	the family	360	” Hadria reminded him . “
157474	157490	157498	157498	Hadria	211	” They laughed , and the Professor , after a pause , continued his pleading . “
157513	157531	157510	157510	your	211	” He came forward and sat down on the seat beside her , bending towards her persuasively . “
157548	157549	157544	157544	me	0	” “
157599	157600	157602	157603	your mother	832	” “
157605	157606	157602	157603	your mother	832	” “
157614	157620	157602	157603	your mother	832	” Hadria set her teeth . “
157629	157630	157633	157633	Hadria	211	” “
157643	157644	157636	157636	you	0	” “
157659	157660	157651	157651	one	329	” “

157735	157740	157732	157732	I	0	” she said feverishly . “
157781	157782	157732	157732	I	0	” “
157840	157841	157846	157846	you	0	” “
157850	157876	157846	157846	you	0	” Hadria was picking the petals off a buttercup one by one , and when she had destroyed one golden corolla , she attacked another . “
157881	157885	157846	157846	you	0	” she exclaimed . “
157905	157910	157911	157911	My	0	” The Professor laughed . “
157940	157941	157985	157986	Mrs. Walker	162	” “
157948	157955	157985	157986	Mrs. Walker	162	” Theobald admitted with a chuckle . “
158030	158031	158002	158003	Mrs. Jordan	179	” “
158039	158046	158037	158037	Hadria	211	” exclaimed the Professor , laughing . “
158051	158055	158037	158037	Hadria	211	” she said , “
158126	158127	158130	158130	I	0	” “
158132	158137	158138	158138	You	0	” asked the Professor . “
158188	158282	158182	158182	I	0	” Hadria buried her face in her hands , as if to shut out distracting sights and sounds , so that she might think more clearly . It seemed , at that moment , as if cutting one 's throat would be the only way out of the growing difficulty . How could it go on ? And yet , how could she give him up ? ( The imp gave a fiendish chuckle . ) It would be so unfair , so cruel , and what would life be without him ? ( “
158287	158307	158182	158182	I	0	” cried the imp , with a yell of laughter . ) It would be so mean to go back now—(“Shocking
158309	158328	158182	158182	I	0	” exclaimed the imp . ) Assuming that she ought never to have allowed this thing to happen ( “
158333	158386	158182	158182	I	0	” ) because she bore another man 's name ( not being permitted to retain her own ) , ought she to throw this man over , on second and ( per assumption ) better thoughts , or did the false step oblige her to continue in the path she had entered ? “
158404	158408	158409	158409	You	3143	” she exclaimed . “
158441	158442	158444	158444	she	3144	” “
158463	158464	158469	158469	you	0	” “
158471	158556	158469	158469	you	0	” The Professor stopped abruptly and stood listening . They looked at one another . Hadria was deadly white . A step was advancing along the winding path through the bushes behind them : a half over - grown path , that led from a small door in the wall that ran round the park . It was the nearest route from the station to the house , and a short cut could be taken this way through the garden , to Craddock Place . “
158562	158571	158572	158572	we	3146	” the Professor said in a low voice ; “
158578	158584	158572	158572	we	3146	” The step drew nearer . “
158602	158603	158585	158600	Some visitor to Craddock Place probably , who has come down by the 4.20 from town	3147	” “
158607	158651	158604	158605	Professor Fortescue	116	” Hadria had sprung up , and was standing , with flushed cheeks , beside her calmer companion . Professor Fortescue 's voice broke the momentary silence . He gave a warm smile of pleasure and came forward with out - stretched hand . “
158664	158815	158661	158661	I	0	” he cried genially . Hadria was shocked to see him looking very ill . He said that his doctor had bullied him , at last , into deciding to go south . His arrangements for departure had been rather hastily made , and he had telegraphed this morning , to Craddock Place , to announce his coming . His luggage was following in a hand - cart , and he was taking the short cut through the Priory gardens . He had come to say good - bye to them all . Miss Du Prel , he added , had already made up her mind to go abroad , and he hoped to come across her somewhere in Italy . She had given him all news . He looked anxiously at Hadria . The flush had left her face now , and the altered lines were but too obvious . “
158823	158827	158816	158816	You	3149	” he said , “
158834	158839	158828	158828	you	3149	” She laughed nervously . “
158847	158848	158842	158842	I	0	” “
158865	158866	158869	158869	we	3150	” “
158876	158889	158869	158869	we	3150	” said Professor Theobald , drawing his colleague on to the seat , “
158905	158906	158891	158891	your	3149	” “
158915	158920	158891	158891	your	3149	” said Professor Fortescue . “
158925	158926	158922	158922	you	3149	” “
158986	158987	158998	158998	he	3704	” “
158991	158996	158998	158998	he	3704	” replied Professor Fortescue . “
159023	159024	158998	158998	he	3704	” “
159045	159046	159035	159037	a poor fool	3153	” “

159063	159064	159057	159058	Mrs. Temperley	154	” “

159107	159112	159113	159113	He	3704	” said Professor Fortescue . “
159166	159167	159146	159146	he	3704	” “
159173	159184	159146	159146	he	3704	” said Theobald , with a triumphant glance at Hadria . “
159234	159235	159239	159239	women	606	” “
159245	159249	159239	159239	women	606	” began Theobald . “
159288	159289	159279	159279	you	3169	” “
159309	159326	159291	159291	you	3169	” asked Hadria . Professor Fortescue looked round at her , half anxiously , half enquiringly . “
159333	159337	159291	159291	you	3169	” he warned . “
159400	159478	159481	159481	you	3174	” There was a long silence . Hadria had been growing more and more restless since the arrival of the new - comer . She took no further part in the conversation . She was struggling to avoid making comparisons between her two companions . The contrast was startling . Every cadence of their voices , every gesture , proclaimed the radical difference of nature and calibre . Hadria rose abruptly . She looked pale and perturbed . “
159490	159541	159481	159481	you	3174	” she asked . They both looked a little surprised , but they acquiesced at once . The three walked together down the yew avenue , and out across the lawn . Professor Fortescue recalled their past meetings among these serene retreats , and wished they could come over again . “
159549	159560	159481	159481	you	3174	” said Hadria . Theobald glanced at her , meaningly . “
159568	159585	159586	159586	I	0	” he said , grasping Professor Fortescue by the arm , and bending confidentially towards him , “
159613	159623	159606	159606	I	0	” Hadria turned deadly pale , and stumbled slightly . “
159652	159653	159654	159654	We	3182	” “
159660	159664	159654	159654	We	3182	” said Theobald . “
159692	159693	159686	159686	you	3821	” “
159721	159722	159725	159725	I	0	” “
159745	159746	159742	159742	friends	886	” “
159751	159785	159742	159742	friends	886	” exclaimed Theobald . Professor Fortescue looked vaguely round , as if expecting Hadria to express some neighbourly sentiment , but she said nothing . He noticed how very ill she was looking . “
159794	159800	159787	159787	you	3821	” he asked in concern . “
159810	159929	159787	159787	you	3821	” But Hadria preferred to go on and rest at home . She asked when Professor Fortescue was coming to see them at the Red House , but her tone was less open and warm than usual , in addressing him . He said that to - morrow he would walk over in the afternoon , if he might . Hadria would not allow her companions to come out of their way to accompany her home . At the Priory gate — where the griffins were grinning as derisively as ever at the ridiculous ways of men — they took their respective roads . Some domestic catastrophe had happened at the Red House . The cook had called Mary “
159932	159945	159787	159787	you	3821	” and Mary declared she must leave . Hadria shrugged her shoulders . “
159956	160587	159953	159953	you	3189	” she said wearily , and retired to her room , in a mood to be cynically amused at the tragedies that the human being manufactures for himself , lest he should not find the tragedies of birth and death and parting , and the solitude of the spirit , sufficient to occupy him during his little pilgrimage . She sat by the open window that looked out over the familiar fields , and the garden that was gay with summer flowers . The red roof of the Priory could just be caught through the trees of the park . She wished the little pilgrimage were over . A common enough wish , she commented , but surely not unreasonable . The picture of those two men came back to her , in spite of every effort to banish it . Professor Fortescue had affected her as if he had brought with him a new atmosphere , and disastrous was the result . It seemed as if Professor Theobald had suddenly become a stranger to her , whom she criticised , whose commonness of fibre , ah me ! whose coarseness , she saw as she might have seen it in some casual acquaintance . And yet she had loved this man , she had allowed him to passionately profess love for her . His companionship , in the deepest sense , had been chosen by her for life . To sit by and listen to that conversation , feeling every moment how utterly he and she were , after all , strangers to one another , how completely unbroken was the solitude that she had craved to dispel — that had been horrible . What had lain at the root of her conduct ? How had she deceived herself ? Was it not for the sake of mere excitement , distraction ? Was it not the sensuous side of her nature that had been touched , while the rest had been posing in the foreground ? But no , that was only partly true . There had been more in it than that ; very much more , or she could not have deceived herself so completely . It was this craving to fill the place of her lost art,—but oh , what morbid nonsense it had all been ! Why , for the first time in her life , did she feel ashamed to meet Professor Fortescue ? Obviously , it was not because she thought he would disapprove of her breaking the social law . It was because she had fallen below her own standard , because she had been hypocritical with herself , played herself false , and acted contemptibly , hatefully ! Professor Fortescue 's mere presence had hunted out the truth from its hiding - place . He had made further self - sophistication impossible . She buried her face in her hands , in an agony of shame . She had known all along , that this had not been a profound and whole - hearted sentiment . She had known all along , of what a poor feverish nature it was ; yet she had chosen to persuade herself that it was all , or nearly all , that she had dreamed of a perfect human relationship . She had tried to arrange facts in such a light as to simulate that idea . It was so paltry , so contemptible . Why could she not at least have been honest with herself , and owned to the nature of the infatuation ? That , at any rate , would have been straightforward . Her self - scorn made the colour surge into her cheeks and burn painfully over neck and brow . “
160683	160858	160670	160670	His	116	” WHEN Professor Fortescue called at the Red House , he found that the blinds , in the drawing - room , were all half down . Hadria held the conversation to the subject of his plans . He knew her well enough to read the meaning of that quiet tone , with a subtle cadence in it , just at the end of a phrase , that went to his heart . To him it testified to an unspeakable regret . It was difficult to define the change in her manner , but it conveyed to the visitor the impression that she had lost belief in herself , or in some one ; that she had received a severe shock , and knew no longer what to trust or how to steer . She seemed to speak across some vast spiritual distance , an effect not produced by reserve or coldness , but by a wistful , acquiescent , subdued quality , expressive of uncertainty , of disorder in her conceptions of things . “
160876	160881	160670	160670	His	116	” said the Professor . “
160891	160902	160670	160670	His	116	” Hadria hesitated for a second , and then rose . “
160911	160994	160670	160670	His	116	” When they were seated under the shade taking their tea , with the canopy of walnut leaves above their heads , the Professor saw that Hadria shewed signs of serious trouble . The haggard lines , the marks of suffering , were not to be hidden in the clear light of the summer afternoon . He insensibly shifted his chair so as not to have to gaze at her when he spoke . That seemed to be a relief to her . “
161006	161010	161011	161011	She	109	” she said . “

161120	161125	161126	161126	You	3196	” Her face saddened . “

161140	161141	161126	161126	You	3196	” “

161258	161263	161244	161244	themselves	4077	” said Hadria musingly . “
161284	161308	161274	161274	One	329	” The Professor threw some crumbs to a chaffinch , which had flown down within a few yards of the tea - table . “
161324	161345	161311	161311	you	3196	” he said in a tone that had drawn forth many a confidence . It was not to be resisted . “
161353	161354	161355	161355	Your	3196	” “
161406	161413	161419	161419	you	0	” There was a long pause . “
161460	161468	161444	161444	My	0	” ( The words hastened on . ) “
161536	161576	161534	161534	desecrator	3214	” The Professor leant forward in his low chair . The chaffinch gave a light chirp , as if to recall him to his duty . Hadria performed it for him . The chaffinch flew off with the booty . “
161593	161602	161534	161534	desecrator	3214	” he said , and his voice trembled . “
161633	161634	161534	161534	desecrator	3214	” “
161638	161639	161534	161534	desecrator	3214	” “
161678	161679	161534	161534	desecrator	3214	” “
161698	162057	162058	162058	Siena	281	” exclaimed Hadria . There was a step on the lawn behind them . The Professor sprang up . He went to meet Valeria and they came to the table together , talking . Valeria 's eyes were bright and her manner animated . Yes , she was going abroad . It would be delightful to meet somewhere , if chance favoured them . She thought of Italy . And at that magic name , they fell into reminiscences of former journeyings ; they talked of towns and temples and palaces , of art , of sunshine ; and Hadria listened silently . Once , in her girlhood , when she was scarcely sixteen she had gone with her parents and Algitha for a tour in Italy . It was a short but vivid experience which had tinged her life , leaving a memory and a longing that never died . The movement of travel , the sense of change and richness offered to eye and mind , remained with her always ; the vision of a strange , tumultuous , beautiful world ; of exquisite Italian cities , of forests and seas ; of classic plains and snow - capped mountains ; of treasures of art — the eternal evidence of man 's aloofness , on one side of him , from the savage element in nature — and glimpses of cathedral domes and palace walls ; and villages clinging like living things to the hill - sides , or dreaming away their drowsy days in some sunny valley . And then the mystery that every work of man enshrines ; the life , the thought , the need that it embodies , and the passionate histories that it hides ! It was as if the sum and circumstance of life had mirrored itself in the memory , once and for all . The South lured her with its languor , its colour , its hot sun , and its splendid memories . It was exquisite pleasure and exquisite pain to listen to the anticipations of these two , who were able to wander as they would . “
162060	162067	162058	162058	Siena	281	” said Valeria with a sigh , “
162149	162150	162151	162151	You	0	” “
162162	162166	162167	162167	I	0	” said Hadria . “
162201	162202	162205	162205	you	0	” “
162217	162218	162205	162205	you	0	” “
162225	162229	162219	162219	I	0	” said Valeria , “
162241	162242	162243	162243	I	0	” “
162271	162451	162452	162452	I	0	” observed the Professor . Valeria shook her head , and remained silent . But her face expressed the sad thoughts left unsaid . In youth , it was all very well . One had the whole world before one , life to explore , one 's powers to test . But later on , when all that seemed to promise fades away , when the dreams drift out of sight , and strenuous efforts repeated and repeated , are beaten down by the eternal obstacles ; when the heart is wearied by delay , disappointment , infruition , vain toil , then this once intoxicating world becomes a place of desolation to the woman who has rebelled against the common lot . And all the old instincts awake , to haunt and torment ; to demand that which reason has learnt to deny or to scorn ; to burden their victims with the cruel heritage of the past ; to whisper regrets and longings , and sometimes to stir to a conflict and desperation that end in madness . “
162479	162488	162452	162452	I	0	” Valeria observed , aloud . Hadria laughed . “
162516	162517	162518	162518	I	0	” “
162536	162540	162523	162523	I	0	” cried Valeria . “

162630	162662	162626	162626	You	109	” cried Valeria , half annoyed , although she laughed . She had the instinctive human desire to assert her ability in the direction where of all others it was lacking . “
162759	162760	162761	162761	You	109	” “
162768	162774	162761	162761	You	109	” cried Valeria , discontentedly . “
162791	162792	162761	162761	You	109	” “
162806	162810	162795	162795	I	0	” said Valeria . “

162879	162897	162898	162898	I	0	” said the Professor . A silence fell upon the three . Their thoughts were evidently busy . “
162902	162909	162898	162898	I	0	” the Professor said at last , “
162993	162994	162980	162980	I	0	” “
163000	163001	162980	162980	I	0	” “

163235	163236	163227	163227	they	606	” “

163276	163328	163240	163240	you	3250	” answered Valeria . Again a silence fell on the little group . The spoken words seemed to call up a host of words unspoken . There was to Hadria , a personal as well as a general significance in each sentence , that made her listen breathlessly for the next . “
163337	163341	163331	163331	you	3250	” she asked . “
163351	163356	163344	163344	I	0	” replied the Professor . “
163368	163372	163361	163361	we	3252	” said Valeria . “
163377	163385	163373	163373	We	3252	” cried Hadria , with a laugh . “
163429	163434	163411	163411	you	3259	” said the Professor . “
163446	163450	163411	163411	you	3259	” said Hadria . “
163513	163514	163515	163515	I	0	” “
163518	163522	163515	163515	I	0	” said Hadria , “
163577	163578	163581	163581	they	3262	” “
163587	163597	163581	163581	they	3262	” exclaimed Valeria , laughing and shaking her head . “
163601	163602	163581	163581	they	3262	” “
163674	163675	163652	163652	I	0	” “
163684	164196	163652	163652	I	0	” said the Professor . A long shadow fell across Hadria as she spoke , blotting out the little flicker of the sunlight that shone through the stirring leaves . Professor Theobald had crept up softly across the lawn , and as the chairs were turned towards the flower - borders , he had approached unobserved . Hadria gave so violent a start when she heard his voice , that Professor Fortescue looked at her anxiously . He thought her nerves must be seriously out of order . The feverish manner of her greeting to the new - comer , confirmed his fear . Professor Theobald apologized for intruding . He had given up his intention of going up to town to - day . He meant to put it off till next week . He could not miss Fortescue 's visit . One could not tell when one might see him again . And Professor Theobald led the conversation airily on ; talking fluently , and at times brilliantly , but always with that indefinable touch of something ignoble , something coarse , that now filled Hadria with unspeakable dismay . She was terrified lest the other two should go , and he should remain . And yet she ought to speak frankly to him . His conversation was full of little under - meanings , intended for her only to understand ; his look , his manner to her made her actually hate him . Yet she felt the utter inconsequence and injustice of her attitude . He had not changed . There was nothing new in him . The change was in herself . Professor Fortescue had awakened her . But , of course , he was one in ten thousand . It was not fair to make the comparison by which Professor Theobald suffered so pitiably . At that moment , as if Fate had intended to prove to her how badly Professor Theobald really stood comparison with any thoroughly well - bred man , even if infinitely beneath him intellectually , Joseph Fleming happened to call . He was his old self again , simple , friendly , contented . Theobald was in one of his self - satisfied moods . Perhaps he enjoyed the triumph of his position in regard to Hadria . At any rate , he seemed to pounce on the new - comer as a foil to his own brilliancy . Joseph had no talent to oppose to it , but he had a simple dignity , the offspring of a kind and generous nature , which made Professor Theobald 's conduct towards him appear contemptible . Professor Fortescue shifted uncomfortably in his chair . Hadria tried to change the topic ; the flush deepening in her cheeks . Professor Fortescue attempted to come to her aid . Joseph Fleming laughed good - naturedly . They sat late into the evening . Theobald could not find an excuse to outstay his colleague , since they were both guests at the same house . “
164208	164223	164197	164197	I	0	” he managed to whisper . There - was no time for a reply . “
164232	164265	164224	164224	I	0	” said Valeria . Hadria went into the house by the open window of the drawing - room . She sank back on the sofa ; a blackness came before her eyes . “
164291	164331	164274	164274	I	0	” When Valeria entered , dressed for dinner , she found Hadria , deadly pale , standing against the sofa , whose arm she was grasping with both hands , as if for dear life . Valeria rushed forward . “
164343	164344	164338	164338	you	211	” “
164347	164351	164338	164338	you	211	” said Hadria , “
164369	164433	164434	164434	You	211	” THE morning had passed as usual , but household arrangements at the Cottage had required much adjustment , one of the maids being ill . She had been sent away for a rest , and the difficulty was to find another . Mary went from the Red House as substitute , in the mean time , and the Red House became disorganised . “
164464	164476	164444	164444	I	0	” Valeria was established on the lawn , with a book . “
164487	164491	164444	164444	I	0	” explained Hadria . “
164502	164503	164495	164496	Professor Theobald	181	” “
164515	164948	164506	164506	you	211	” Hadria returned , and hastened away . She stopped at Martha 's cottage for the child . Ah ! What would become of her if it were not for Martha ? The two sauntered together along the Craddock road . All night long , Hadria had been trying to decide when and how to speak to Professor Theobald . Should she send for him ? Should she write to him ? Should she trust to chance for an opportunity of speaking ? But , no , she could not endure to see him again in the presence of others , before she had spoken ! Yesterday 's experience had been too terrible . She had brought pencil and paper with her , in order to be able to write to him , if she decided on that course . There were plenty of retired nooks under the shade of the yew - trees in the churchyard , where one could write . The thick hedges made it perfectly secluded , and at this hour , it was always solitary . Little Martha was gathering wild - flowers in the hedges . She used to pluck them to lay on her mother 's grave . She had but a vague idea of that unknown mother , but Hadria had tried to make the dead woman live again , in the child 's mind , as a gentle and tender image . The little offering was made each time that they took their walk in the direction of Craddock . The grave looked fresh and sweet in the summer sunshine , with the ivy creeping up the tomb - stone and half obliterating the name . A rose - tree that Hadria and Martha had planted together , was laden with rich red blooms . The two figures stood , hand in hand , by the grave . The child stooped to place her little tribute of flowers at the head of the green mound . Neither of them noticed a tall figure at the wicket gate . He stood outside , looking up the path , absolutely motionless . Martha let go Hadria 's hand , and ran off after a gorgeous butterfly that had fluttered over the headstone : a symbol of the soul ; fragile , beautiful , helpless thing that any rough hand may crush and ruin . Hadria turned to watch the graceful , joyous movement of the child , and her delight in the beauty of the rich brown wings , with their enamelled spots of sapphire . “
164951	165777	165778	165778	Hadria	211	” She gave a little gasping cry , and turned sharply . Professor Theobald looked at her with an intent , triumphant expression . She stood before him , for the moment , as if paralysed . It was by no means the first time that this look had crossed his face , but she had been blind , and had not fully understood it . He interpreted her cry and her paleness , as signs of the fullness of his power over her . This pleased him immeasurably . His self - love basked and purred . He felt that his moment of triumph had come . Contrasting this meeting with the last occasion when they had stood together beside this grave , had he not ground for self - applause ? He remembered so well that unpleasant episode . It was Hadria who stood then in the more powerful position . He had actually feared to meet her eye . He remembered how bitterly she had spoken , of her passion for revenge , of the relentless feud between man and woman . They had discussed the question of vengeance ; he had pointed out its futility , and Hadria had set her teeth and desired it none the less . Lady Engleton had reminded her of a woman 's helplessness if she places herself in opposition to a man , for whom all things are ordered in the society that he governs ; her only chance of striking a telling blow being through his passions . If he were in love with her , then there might be some hope of making him wince . And Hadria , with a fierce swiftness had accepted the condition , with a mixture of confidence in her own power of rousing emotion , if she willed , and of scorn for the creature who could be appealed to through his passions , but not through his sense of justice . That she might herself be in that vulnerable condition , had not appeared to strike her as possible . It was a challenge that he could not but accept . She attracted him irresistibly . From the first moment of meeting , he had felt her power , and recognized , at the same time , the strange spirit of enmity that she seemed to feel towards him , and to arouse in him against her . He felt the savage in him awake , the desire of mere conquest . Long had he waited and watched , and at last he had seen her flush and tremble at his approach ; and as if to make his victory more complete and insolent , it was at this grave that she was to confess herself ready to lose the world for his sake ! Yes ; and she should understand the position of affairs to the full , and consent nevertheless ! Her adoption of the child had added to his triumph . He could not think of it without a sense of something humourous in the relation of events . If ever Fate was ironical , this was the occasion ! He felt so sure of Hadria to - day , that he was swayed by an overpowering temptation to reveal to her the almost comic situation . It appealed to his sense of the absurd , and to the savagery that lurked , like a beast of prey , at the foundation of his nature . Her evident emotion when he arrived yesterday afternoon and all through his visit , her agitation to - day , at the mere sound of his voice , assured him that his hold over her was secure . He must be a fool indeed if he could not keep it , in spite of revelations . To offer himself to her threatened vengeance of his own accord , and to see her turned away disarmed , because she loved him ; that would be the climax of his victory ! There was something of their old antagonism , in the attitude in which they stood facing one another by the side of the grave , looking straight into one another 's eyes . The sound of the child 's happy laughter floated back to them across the spot where its mother lay at rest . Whether Theobald 's intense consciousness of the situation had , in some way , affected Hadria , or whether his expression had given a clue , it would be difficult to say , but suddenly , as a whiff of scent invades the senses , she became aware of a new and horrible fact which had wandered into her mind , she knew not how ; and she took a step backwards , as if stunned , breathing shortly and quickly . Again he interpreted this as a sign of intense feeling . “
165780	165787	165788	165788	you	211	” he said bending towards her , “
165793	165808	165788	165788	you	211	” He did not wait for her answer , so confident did he feel . “
165832	165843	165844	165844	I	0	” She tried to speak , but he interrupted her . “
165966	165984	165985	165985	I	0	” Hadria had remained , for a second , perfectly still , and then turned abruptly away . “
166062	166101	166102	166102	Hadria	211	” He stretched out his arms and stood waiting before her . But she was silent . He was not surprised . Such a revelation , at such a moment , must , of necessity , stun her . “
166144	166148	166141	166141	your	211	” Still silence . “
166159	166163	166150	166150	you	211	” he repeated . “
166166	166171	166150	166150	you	211	” she said abruptly , “
166212	166231	166206	166206	they	606	” The Professor started , as if he had been struck . They stood looking at one another . “
166295	166312	166285	166285	Hadria	211	” She was standing very still and very calm . Her tones were clear and deliberate . “
166371	166380	166365	166366	the wives	3275	” ( she turned to the grave ) , “
166404	166405	166406	166406	You	211	” “
166429	166442	166416	166416	you	211	” He came forward a step , and she drew back hurriedly . “
166456	166457	166448	166448	I	0	” “
166492	166504	166469	166469	I	0	” Hadria looked at him , with a cold miserable smile . “
166510	166514	166469	166469	I	0	” she cried ; “
166576	166610	166564	166564	I	0	” He gave a hoarse , inarticulate cry , and turned sharply round . His hands went up to his head . Then he veered suddenly , and went fiercely up to her . “
166680	166773	166675	166676	a woman	3753	” He broke into a laugh that sounded ghastly and cruel , in the serene calm of the churchyard . The laugh seemed to get the better of him . He had lost self - control . He put his hands on his hips and went on laughing harshly , yet sometimes with a real mirth , as if by that means only could he express the fierce emotions that had been roused in him . Mortified and furious as he was , he derived genuine and cynical amusement from the incident . “
166840	166906	166909	166909	me	0	” He leant his arms on the tombstone and laughed on softly , his big form shaking , his strange sinister face appearing over the stone , irradiated with merriment . In the dusk , among the graves , the grinning face looked like that of some mocking demon , some gargoyle come to life , to cast a spell of evil over the place . “
166917	166923	166909	166909	me	0	” His eyes were streaming . “
167034	167053	167015	167015	Lord	3289	” He grasped his head in his hands ; then suddenly , he broke out into another paroxysm . “
167078	167091	167011	167011	Lord	3288	” He slowly recovered calmness , and remained leaning on the gravestone . “
167103	167108	167093	167093	I	0	” he asked presently . “
167119	167144	167093	167093	I	0	” He drew himself up from his leaning attitude , and repeated the question , in different words . Hadria answered it , briefly . “
167150	167163	167093	167093	I	0	” he said , the savage gleam coming back to his eyes . “
167174	167178	167171	167171	Fortescue	116	” Hadria flushed . “
167212	167213	167192	167192	I	0	” “
167219	167220	167192	167192	I	0	” “
167243	167249	167250	167250	You	3285	” He set his lips . “
167258	167259	167250	167250	You	3285	” “
167276	167291	167263	167263	I	0	” Something that I had , and Fortescue had not , it would seem . ”
167292	167295	167328	167328	He	3285	“ Yes . ”
167296	167327	167328	167328	He	3285	“ And so , on account of this diaphanous , indescribable , exquisite something , I am to be calmly thrown over ; calmly told to go about my business ! ”
167368	167376	167377	167377	she	211	“ I have no defence to make , ”
167380	167550	167377	167377	she	211	“ I know I have behaved contemptibly ; self - deception is no excuse . I can explain but not justify myself . I wanted to escape from my eternal self ; I was tired of fighting and always in vain . I wanted to throw myself into the life and hopes of somebody else , somebody who had some chance of a real and effective existence . Then other elements of attraction and temptation came ; your own memory will tell how many there were . You knew so well how to surround me with these . Everything conspired to tempt me . It seemed as if , in you , I had found a refuge from myself . You have no little power over the emotions , as you are aware . My feeling has been genuine , heaven knows ! but , always , always , through it all , I have been aware of this element that repels me ; and I have distrusted you . ”
167551	167558	167559	167559	he	3291	“ I knew you distrusted me , ”
167563	167628	167559	167559	he	3291	“ It is useless to say I bitterly regret it all . Naturally , I regret it far more bitterly than you can do . And if my conduct towards you rankles in your heart , you can remember that I have to contend with what is far worse than any sense of being badly treated : the sense of having treated someone badly . ”
167690	167693	167694	167694	he	3291	“ Damn ! ”
167771	167795	167796	167796	She	129	“ And you mean to tell me we are to part ? You mean to tell me that this is your final decision ? ”
167848	167855	167856	167856	he	3291	“ You do n't love me ? ”
167859	167872	167856	167856	he	3291	“ Let me go , let me go — coward — madman ! ”
167873	167880	167881	167881	he	3291	“ You do n't love me ? ”
167884	167893	167881	167881	he	3291	“ I hate you — let me go ! ”
167894	167902	167856	167856	he	3291	“ If this is the last time — ”
167903	167911	167856	167856	he	3291	“ I wish I could kill you ! ”
167912	167924	167856	167856	he	3291	“ Ah , that is the sort of woman I like ! ”
167925	167939	167856	167856	he	3291	“ You make me know what it is to feel like a murderess ! ”
167940	167950	167951	167951	She	3291	“ And to look like one , by heaven ! ”
167961	167964	167965	167965	she	3291	“ Coward ! ”
167968	167976	167965	167965	she	3291	“ I did right to mistrust you ! ”
168046	168061	168062	168062	she	211	“ Come , come , Martha , let us go , let us go , ”
168078	168110	168067	168067	He	3298	“ I have to thank you for bestowing a mother 's care on my poor child . You can suppose what a joy the thought has been to me all along . ”
168114	168121	168122	168122	she	211	“ You need not thank me , ”
168125	168176	168177	168177	She	211	“ As you know , I did it first for her mother 's sake , and out of hatred to you , unknown as you then were to me . Now I will do it for her own sake , and out of hatred to you , bitterer than ever . ”
168186	168239	168177	168177	She	211	“ You are most kind , but I could not think of troubling you any longer . I think of taking the little one myself . She will be a comfort to me , and will cheer my lonely home . And besides you see , duty , Mrs. Temperley , duty — ”
168249	168269	168242	168242	her	211	“ You are going to take her away from me ? You are going to revenge yourself like that ? ”
168270	168349	168350	168350	Hadria	211	“ You have made me feel my responsibilities towards my child , as I fear I did not feel them before . I am powerless , of course , to make up for the evil I have done her , but I can make some reparation . I can take her to live with me ; I can give her care and attention , I can give her a good education . I have made up my mind . ”
168360	168393	168350	168350	Hadria	211	“ You said that vengeance was futile . So it is . Leave the child to me . She shall — she shall want for nothing . Only leave her to me . ”
168394	168402	168403	168403	he	3303	“ Duty must be our first consideration , ”
168407	168421	168403	168403	he	3303	“ I can give her all she needs . Leave her to me . ”
168429	168441	168426	168426	his	4071	“ How do I know you have told me the truth ? ”
168451	168459	168460	168460	he	3303	“ Do you mean to dispute it ? ”
168467	168478	168479	168479	he	3303	“ I think you would find that a mistaken policy , ”
168486	168497	168499	168499	Hadria	211	“ I do n't believe you can take her away ! ”
168501	168543	168499	168499	Hadria	211	“ I am acting for her mother , and her mother , not having made herself into your legal property , has some legal right to her own child . I do n't believe you can make me give her up . ”
168551	168833	168544	168545	The Professor	4071	“ I think you will find that the law has infinite respect for a father 's holiest feelings . Would you have it interfere with his awakening aspirations to do his duty towards his child ? What a dreadful thought ! And then , I think you have some special views on the education of the little one which I can not entirely approve . After all , a woman has probably to be a wife and mother , on the good old terms that have served the world for a fair number of centuries , when one comes to consider it : it is a pity to allow her to grow up without those dogmas and sentiments that may help to make the position tolerable , if not always satisfactory , to her . Though , as a philosopher , one may see the absurdity of popular prejudices , yet as a practical man , one feels the inexpediency of disturbing the ideas upon which the system depends , and thus adding to the number of malcontents . All very well for those who think things out for themselves ; but the education of a girl should be on the old lines , believe me . You will not believe me , I know , so I think it better , for this as well as for other reasons , to take my daughter under my own care . I am extremely sorry that you should have had all this trouble and responsibility for nothing . And I am grieved that your educational idea should be so frustrated , but what am I to do ? My duty is obvious ! ”
168834	168856	168857	168857	Hadria	211	“ I regret that you did not become a devotee to duty , either a little sooner or a little later , ”
168860	168895	168857	168857	Hadria	211	“ For the present , I suppose Martha will remain with Hannah , until your conscience decides what course you will take , and until I see whether you can carry out your threat . ”
168896	168912	168950	168951	the Professor	4071	“ Certainly , certainly ! I do n't wish to give you any unnecessary pain . ”
168913	168919	168920	168920	Hadria	211	“ You are consideration itself . ”
168938	168948	168950	168951	the Professor	4071	“ Will you say good - bye , Martha ? ”
168995	169013	169014	169014	Martha	129	“ Oh , cruel , cruel ! What if I do n't bring her any more toys ? ”
169018	169026	169028	169028	Hadria	211	“ Will you allow us to pass ? ”
169129	169149	169150	169150	she	176	“ Of course , though I ca n't exonerate you , Professor , I blame her more than you , ”
169154	169172	169150	169150	she	176	“ for her standard in the matter was so different from your's — you being a man . ”
169219	169233	169235	169236	Lady Engleton	176	“ Did she confess everything to her aunt after her return from Portsmouth ? ”
169238	169247	169235	169236	Lady Engleton	176	“ Yes ; I have that letter now . ”
169248	169256	169235	169236	Lady Engleton	176	“ In which your name is mentioned ? ”
169257	169357	169235	169236	Lady Engleton	176	“ In which my name is mentioned . I sent money to the girl , but she returned it . She said that she hated me , and would not touch it . So I gave the money to the aunt , and told her to send it on , in her own name , to Ellen , for the child 's support . Of course I made secrecy a condition . So as a matter of fact , I have acknowledged the child , though not publicly , and I have contributed to its support from its birth . ”
169358	169369	169371	169372	Lady Engleton	176	“ But I thought Mrs. Temperley had been supporting it ! ”
169374	169416	169371	169372	Lady Engleton	176	“ Nevertheless I have continued to send the money to the aunt . If Mrs. Temperley chose to take charge of the child , I certainly had nothing to complain of . And I could not openly contribute without declaring myself . ”
169417	169435	169235	169236	Lady Engleton	176	“ Dear me , it is all very strange ! What would Hadria say if she knew ? ”
169436	169441	169235	169236	Lady Engleton	176	“ She does know . ”
169442	169448	169371	169372	Lady Engleton	176	“ What , all along ? ”
169449	169455	169235	169236	Lady Engleton	176	“ No , since yesterday . ”
169456	169464	169235	169236	Lady Engleton	176	“ And how does she take it ? ”
169465	169494	169371	169372	Lady Engleton	176	“ She is bitter against me . It is only natural , especially as I told her that I wanted to have the child under my own care . ”
169495	169515	169235	169236	Lady Engleton	176	“ Ah , that will be a blow to her . She was wrapped up in the little girl . ”
169566	169581	169558	169559	Lady Engleton	176	“ Then may I count on you to plead my cause with Mrs. Temperley ? ”
169582	169603	169663	169664	Lady Engleton	176	“ If Hadria believes that it is for the child 's good , she will not stand in the way . ”
169604	169618	169558	169559	Lady Engleton	176	“ Unless—. You remember that idea of vengeance that she used to have ? ”
169619	169634	169558	169559	Lady Engleton	176	“ Oh , she would not let vengeance interfere with the child 's welfare ! ”
169635	169657	169663	169664	Lady Engleton	176	“ I hope not . You see I do n't want to adopt strong measures . The law is always odious . ”
169658	169662	169558	169559	Lady Engleton	176	“ The law ! ”
169668	169684	169663	169664	Lady Engleton	176	“ Are you sure that the law would give you the custody of the child ? ”
169685	169779	169663	169664	Lady Engleton	176	“ Sure of the law ? My dear lady , one might as well be sure of a woman — pardon me ; you know that I regard this quality of infinite flexibility as one of the supreme charms of your sex . I ca n't say that I feel it to be the supreme charm of the law . Mrs. Temperley claims to have her authority through the mother , because she has the written consent of the aunt to the adoption , but I think this is rather stretching a point . ”
169780	169796	169663	169664	Lady Engleton	176	“ I fear it is , since the poor mother was dead at the time . ”
169797	169811	169813	169813	Theobald	181	“ I can prove everything I have said to the satisfaction of anybody , ”
169815	169840	169813	169813	Theobald	181	“ I think my claim to take charge of my child is well established , and you will admit the wish is not unreasonable . ”
169841	169861	169663	169664	Lady Engleton	176	“ It does you great credit , but , oh dear , it will be hard for Mrs. Temperley . ”
169862	169890	169663	169664	Lady Engleton	176	“ I fear it will . I am most grieved , but what am I to do ? I must consider the best interests of the child . ”
169891	169908	169813	169813	Theobald	181	“ Doubtless , but you are a trifle late , Professor , in thinking of that . ”
169909	169920	169663	169664	Lady Engleton	176	“ Would you prefer it to be never than late ? ”
169921	169925	169663	169664	Lady Engleton	176	“ Heaven forbid ! ”
169926	169955	169956	169957	Lady Engleton	176	“ Then I may rely on you to explain the position of affairs to Mrs. Temperley ? You will understand that it is a painful subject between us . ”
169979	169991	169993	169994	Lady Engleton	176	“ Then I have not spoken in vain , dear Hadria ? ”
170007	170018	170002	170002	Hadria	211	“ On the contrary , you have spoken to convince . ”
170019	170036	170037	170037	Hadria	211	“ I knew that you would do nothing to stand in the way of the child . ”
170041	170073	170037	170037	Hadria	211	“ I am very sorry about it . You were so devoted to the little girl , and it does seem terribly hard that she should be taken away from you . ”
170074	170081	170082	170082	Hadria	211	“ It was my last chance , ”
170088	170099	170082	170082	Hadria	211	“ Then I suppose you will not attempt to resist ? ”
170100	170103	170105	170105	Hadria	211	“ No , ”
170107	170119	170105	170105	Hadria	211	“ He thinks of leaving Martha with you for another month . ”
170120	170196	170197	170198	Lady Engleton	176	“ Really ? It has not struck him that perhaps I may not keep her for another month . Now that it is once established that Martha is to be regarded as under his guardianship and authority , and that my jurisdiction ceases , he must take her at once . I will certainly not act for him in that matter . Since you are in his confidence , would you kindly tell him that ? ”
170202	170217	170197	170198	Lady Engleton	176	“ Certainly ; I suppose he and his sister will look after the child . ”
170218	170227	170105	170105	Hadria	211	“ I shall send Martha up with Hannah . ”
170228	170234	170105	170105	Hadria	211	“ It will astonish him . ”
170235	170249	170197	170198	Lady Engleton	176	“ Does he really think I am going to act as his deputy ? ”
170250	170265	170105	170105	Hadria	211	“ He thought you would be glad to have Martha as long as possible . ”
170266	170281	170105	170105	Hadria	211	“ As the child of Ellen Jervis , yes — not as his child . ”
170282	170294	170296	170297	Lady Engleton	176	“ I do n't see that it matters much , myself , ”
170299	170308	170296	170297	Lady Engleton	176	“ however , I will let him know . ”
170309	170324	170105	170105	Hadria	211	“ By telegram , please , because Martha will be sent to - morrow . ”
170325	170330	170105	170105	Hadria	211	“ What breathless haste ! ”
170331	170356	170105	170105	Hadria	211	“ Why delay ? Hannah will be there — she knows everything about her charge ; and if she is only allowed to stay — ”
170357	170367	170105	170105	Hadria	211	“ He told me he meant to keep her . ”
170368	170375	170105	170105	Hadria	211	“ I am thankful for that ! ”
170496	170515	170517	170518	Lady Engleton	176	“ So you and poor little Martha will go up together by the afternoon train , I suppose , ”
170564	170569	170556	170556	She	212	“ that bad man . ”
170621	170635	170637	170637	Hadria	211	“ I wonder if Martha realizes at all what is going to happen , ”
170693	170703	170705	170705	Hannah	212	“ I do n't think she understands , ma'am , ”
170707	170735	170705	170705	Hannah	212	“ I kep ' on tellin ' her , and once she cried and said she did not want to go , but she soon forgot it . ”
171115	171121	171122	171122	Valeria	109	“ How oppressive it is ! ”
171206	171213	171215	171215	Hadria	211	“ Oh , no , no , ”
171219	171231	171215	171215	Hadria	211	“ do n't let me begin already to impoverish other lives ! ”
171238	171247	171248	171248	she	211	“ At least I have learnt that lesson , ”
171251	171274	171248	171248	she	211	“ I should have been a fool if I had n't , for my life has been a sermon on the text . ”
171295	171301	171303	171303	Hadria	211	“ It is happening everywhere , ”
171305	171339	171303	171303	Hadria	211	“ the poor , sterile lives exhaust the strong and full ones . I will not be one of those vampire souls , at least not while I have my senses about me . ”
171424	171496	171396	171396	She	109	“ I ca n't bear the idea of leaving you , Hadria , especially when you talk like that . I wish , how I wish , that some way could be found out of this labyrinth . Is this sort of thing to be the end of all the grand new hopes and efforts of women ? Is all our force to be killed and overwhelmed in this absurd way ? ”
171497	171510	171396	171396	She	109	“ Ah , no , not all , in heaven 's name ! ”
171511	171554	171555	171555	Hadria	211	“ But if women wo n't repudiate , in practice , the claims that they hold to be unjust , in theory , how can they hope to escape ? We may talk to all eternity , if we do n't act . ”
171560	171584	171557	171557	her	211	“ Your reasoning is indisputable , but what can one do ? There are cases — in short , some things are impossible ! ”
171589	171605	171606	171606	she	109	“ I have thought , at times , that you might make a better stand , ”
171634	171641	171643	171643	Hadria	211	“ You know my present conditions , ”
171649	171679	171643	171643	Hadria	211	“ I ca n't overcome them . But perhaps some one else in my place might overcome them . I confess I do n't see how . Do you ? ”
171788	171817	171819	171819	Hadria	211	“ Now do you see why I feel so terrified when anyone proposes to narrow down his existence , even in the smallest particular , for my sake ? ”
171821	171888	171819	171819	Hadria	211	“ It is because I see what awful power a human being may acquire of ravaging and of ruling other lives , and I do n't want to acquire that power . I see that the tyranny may be perfectly well - intentioned , and indeed scarcely to be called tyranny , for it is but half conscious , yet only the more irresistible for that . ”
171889	171903	171904	171905	the Professor	4071	“ It is one 's own fault if one submits to conscious tyranny , ”
171909	171923	171904	171905	the Professor	4071	“ and I think tyrant and victim are then much on a par . ”
171924	171932	171933	171933	Hadria	211	“ A mere demand can be resisted , ”
171936	171975	171933	171933	Hadria	211	“ it is grief , real grief , however unreasonable , that brings people to their knees . But , oh , may the day hasten , when people shall cease to grieve when others claim their freedom ! ”
171979	172017	171976	171976	Valeria	109	“ I do n't think you are in much danger of grudging liberty to your neighbours , Hadria ; so you need not be so frightened of becoming a vampire , as I think you call it . ”
172018	172091	172092	172092	Valeria	109	“ Not now , but how can one tell what the result of years and years of monotonous existence may be , or the effect of example ? How did it happen that my mother came to feel aggrieved if her daughters claimed some right of choice in the ordering of their lives ? I suppose it is because her mother felt aggrieved if she ventured to call her soul her own . ”
172095	172101	172103	172103	Hadria	211	“ But it is true , ”
172105	172144	172103	172103	Hadria	211	“ Very few of us , if any , are in the least original as regards our sorrowing . We follow the fashion . We are not so presumptuous as to decide for ourselves what shall afflict us . ”
172145	172154	172156	172156	Valeria	109	“ Or what shall transport us with joy , ”
172162	172221	172156	172156	Valeria	109	“ Still less perhaps . Tradition says ‘ Weep , this is the moment , ’ or ‘ Rejoice , the hour has come , ’ and we chant our dirge or kindle our bonfires accordingly . Why , it means a little martyrdom to the occasional sinner who selects his own occasion for sorrow or for joy . ”
172292	172364	172280	172280	she	211	“ I have seen it , I have seen it ! Those who have been starved in life , levy a sort of tax on the plenty of others , in the instinctive effort to replenish their own empty treasure - house . Only that is impossible . One can gain no riches in that fashion . One can only reduce one 's victim to a beggary like one 's own . ”
172369	172409	172365	172365	Valeria	109	“ The more I see of life , the more bitter a thing it seems to be a woman ! And one of the discouraging features of it is , that women are so ready to oppress each other ! ”
172410	172418	172420	172421	the Professor	4071	“ Because they have themselves suffered oppression , ”
172423	172472	172420	172421	the Professor	4071	“ It is a law that we can not evade ; if we are injured , we pay back the injury , whether we will or not , upon our neighbours . If we are blessed , we bless , but if we are cursed , we curse . ”
172473	172498	172500	172500	Valeria	109	“ These moral laws , or laws of nature , or whatever one likes to call them , seem to be stern as death ! ”
172502	172523	172500	172500	Valeria	109	“ I suppose we are all inheriting the curse that has been laid upon our mothers through so many ages . ”
172524	172536	172538	172538	Hadria	211	“ We are not free from the shades of our grandmothers , ”
172540	172581	172538	172538	Hadria	211	“ only I hope a little ( when I have not been to the Vicarage for some time ) that we may be less of a hindrance and an obsession to our granddaughters than our grandmothers have been to us . ”
172582	172590	172592	172593	the Professor	4071	“ Ah ! that way lies hope ! ”
172595	172605	172592	172593	the Professor	4071	“ I wish , I wish I could believe ! ”
172609	172625	172606	172606	Valeria	109	“ But I was born ten years too early for the faith of this generation . ”
172626	172640	172642	172642	Hadria	211	“ It is you who have helped to give this generation its faith , ”
172644	172665	172642	172642	Hadria	211	“ But have you real hope and real faith , in your heart of hearts ? Tell me , Hadria . ”
172670	172724	172666	172666	Hadria	211	“ Ah ! I knew it . Women do n't really believe that the cloud will lift . If they really believed what they profess , they would prove it . They would not submit and resign themselves . Oh , why do n't you shew what a woman can do , Hadria ? ”
172757	172778	172744	172744	her	211	“ I believe that there are thousands and thousands of women whose lives have run on parallel lines with mine . ”
172978	172985	172987	172987	Valeria	109	“ I chafe against these situations ! ”
172989	173012	172987	172987	Valeria	109	“ I am so unused , in my own life , to such tethers and limitations . They would drive me crazy ! ”
173013	173016	173017	173017	Hadria	211	“ Oh , ”
173025	173032	173017	173017	Hadria	211	“ this is a new cry ! ”
173033	173039	173041	173041	Valeria	109	“ I do n't care , ”
173044	173071	173017	173017	Hadria	211	“ I never supposed that one could be tied hand and foot , in this way . I should never stand it . It is intolerable ! ”
173072	173088	173090	173090	Hadria	211	“ These are what you have frequently commended to me as ‘ home ties , ’ ”
173092	173100	173090	173090	Hadria	211	“ Oh , but it is impossible ! ”
173101	173107	173109	173110	the Professor	4071	“ You attack the family ! ”
173112	173121	173122	173123	The Professor	4071	“ If the family makes itself ridiculous — ? ”
173133	173157	173159	173160	the Professor	4071	“ The natural instinct of man to get his fun at his neighbour 's expense meets with wholesome rebuffs in the outer world , ”
173162	173181	173159	173160	the Professor	4071	“ but in the family it has its chance . That 's why the family is so popular . ”
173204	173256	173197	173197	she	109	“ Well , after all , it is the order of Nature to have one 's fun at the expense of someone , and I do n't believe we shall ever be able to practise any other principle , I mean on a national scale , however much we may progress . ”
173257	173269	173271	173272	the Professor	4071	“ Oh , but we sha n't progress unless we do , ”
173274	173280	173271	173272	the Professor	4071	“ You are always paradoxical . ”
173281	173347	173197	173197	she	109	“ There is no paradox here . I am just as certain as I am of my own existence , that real , solid , permanent progress is impossible to any people until they recognise , as a mere truism , that whatever is gained by cruelty , be it towards the humblest thing alive , is not gain , but the worst of loss . ”
173348	173357	173359	173359	Valeria	109	“ Oh , you always go too far ! ”
173361	173381	173382	173383	the Professor	4071	“ I do n't admit that in a horror of cruelty , it is possible to go too far , ”
173386	173394	173395	173395	He	4071	“ Cruelty is the one unpardonable sin . ”
173429	173440	173441	173441	Valeria	109	“ You wo n't give up your music , Hadria , ”
173452	173461	173441	173441	Valeria	109	“ It is a forlorn sort of pursuit , ”
173470	173479	173462	173462	Hadria	211	“ but I will do all I can . ”
173484	173493	173480	173480	Valeria	109	“ And you will not give up hope ? ”
173494	173500	173441	173441	Valeria	109	“ Hope ? Of what ? ”
173501	173512	173513	173513	Hadria	211	“ Oh , of — of—. What an absurd question ! ”
173516	173570	173513	173513	Hadria	211	“ It is better to face facts , I think , than to shroud them away . After all , it is only by the rarest chance that character and conditions happen to suit each other so well that the powers can be developed . They are generally crushed . One more or less—. ”
173583	173635	173576	173577	The Professor	4071	“ It is exactly the one more or less that sends the balance up or down , that decides the fate of men and nations . An individual often counts more than a generation . If that were not so , nothing would be possible , and hope would be insane . ”
173636	173641	173643	173643	Hadria	211	“ Perhaps it is ! ”
173676	173687	173688	173688	he	4071	“ I fear I shall have to be going back , ”
173849	173857	173859	173860	the Professor	4071	“ I ought really to be going , ”
173896	173916	173917	173917	she	211	“ You will come back and see us at Craddock Dene soon after you return , wo n't you ? ”
173921	174038	173917	173917	she	211	“ Of course I will . And I hope that meanwhile , you will set to work to get strong and well . All your leisure ought to be devoted to that object , for the present . I should be so delighted to hear from you now and again , when you have a spare moment and the spirit moves you . I will write and tell you how I fare , if I may . If , at any time , I can be of service to you , do n't forget how great a pleasure it would be to me to render it . I hope if ever I come back to England — ”
174039	174045	174046	174046	Hadria	211	“ When you come back , ”
174052	174059	174046	174046	Hadria	211	“ that we may meet oftener . ”
174060	174072	174073	174073	They	3378	“ Indeed , that will be something to look forward to ! ”
174305	174318	174319	174319	Dodge	155	“ Dear , dear , she do take on about that child ! ”
174353	174355	174342	174342	her	156	“ holding ”
174360	174363	174342	174342	her	156	“ ways . ”
175243	175249	175250	175250	she	109	“ You and Professor Fortescue , ”
175258	175296	175250	175250	she	109	“ are the two people I love in the world . You are all that I have in life to cling to . Write to me , dearest Hadria , for I am very anxious and wretched . ”
175569	175578	175579	175579	he	159	“ I can see you are very happy , ”
175588	175614	175583	175583	She	81	“ Indeed I ought to be . Life is gloriously worth living , when it is lived in the presence of good and generous souls . ”
175615	175622	175624	175624	Joseph	159	“ I wish I had married , ”
175627	175636	175638	175638	Algitha	81	“ It is not too late to mend , ”
175640	175646	175648	175649	her sister	313	“ How reckless you are ! ”
175651	175681	175648	175649	her sister	313	“ How can you recommend marriage in the abstract ? You happen to have met just the right person , but Mr. Fleming has n't , it would seem . ”
175682	175695	175697	175697	Algitha	81	“ If one person can be so fortunate , so can another , ”
175699	175711	175697	175697	Algitha	81	“ Why tempt Providence ? Rather bear the ills you have — ”
175712	175729	175731	175731	Joseph	159	“ I am surprised to hear you take a gloomy view of anything , Mrs. Temperley , ”
175733	175764	175731	175731	Joseph	159	“ I always thought you so cheerful . You say funnier things than any lady I have ever met , except an Irish girl who used to sing comic songs . ”
175769	175792	175794	175794	Hadria	211	“ How do you know that , in the intervals of her comic songs , that girl has not a gloomy disposition ? ”
175796	175827	175794	175794	Hadria	211	“ Oh no , you can see that she is without a care in the world ; she is like Miss Fullerton , always full of good cheer and kindness . ”
175828	175838	175840	175840	Hadria	211	“ Had she also slums to cheer her up ? ”
175842	175856	175840	175840	Hadria	211	“ No , not at all . She never does anything in particular . ”
175857	175867	175869	175869	Algitha	81	“ I am surprised that she is cheerful then , ”
175871	175877	175869	175869	Algitha	81	“ It wo n't last . ”
175878	175892	175894	175894	Hadria	211	“ It is her slums that keep my sister in such good spirits , ”
175896	175927	175894	175894	Hadria	211	“ Really ! Well , if you are fond of that sort of thing , Mrs. Temperley , there are some nasty enough places at the lower end of Craddock — ”
175928	175944	175946	175946	Hadria	211	“ Oh , it is n't that one clings to slums for slums ' sake , ”
175949	175960	175961	175961	Joseph	159	“ I am afraid they are already overrun with visitors , ”
175964	175972	175961	175961	Joseph	159	“ There are so many Miss Walkers . ”
176273	176276	176291	176291	he	4209	“ missus , ”
176773	176779	176781	176781	Valeria	109	“ My love for him , ”
176783	176834	176781	176781	Valeria	109	“ used at one time to be a great trouble to me . It made me restless and unhappy . Now I am glad of it , and though there must be an element of pain in a hopeless love , yet I hold myself fortunate to have cherished it . ”
177042	177055	177056	177056	she	211	“ Do you remember our famous discussion on Emerson in the garret ? ”
177061	177080	177056	177056	she	211	“ Do I ? It is one of the episodes of our youth that stands out most distinctly . ”
177081	177108	177109	177109	Algitha	81	“ And how about Emerson 's doctrine ? Are we the makers of our circumstances ? Does our fate ‘ fit us like a glove ? ’ ”
177113	177118	177119	177119	she	81	“ I doubt it , ”
177122	177134	177119	177119	she	81	“ Yet you have brilliantly done what you meant to do . ”
177135	177149	177151	177151	Algitha	81	“ My own experience does not overshadow my judgment entirely , I hope , ”
177153	177240	177151	177151	Algitha	81	“ I have seen too much of a certain tragic side of life to be able to lay down a law of that sort . I ca n't believe , for instance , that among all those millions in the East End , not one man or woman , for all these ages , was born with great capacities , which better conditions might have allowed to come to fruition . I think you were right , after all . It is a matter of relation . ”
177372	177382	177384	177384	Henriette	142	“ Hadria was always very sweet , of course , ”
177386	177428	177384	177384	Henriette	142	“ but she had the faults of her qualities , as we all have . You have had your trials , dear Hubert , but I rejoice to believe that Hadria will give you little further cause for pain or regret . ”
177448	177465	177466	177466	he	118	“ I think that the companionship of Lady Engleton has been of great service to Hadria , ”
177474	177477	177479	177479	Henriette	142	“ Unquestionably , ”
177481	177585	177479	177479	Henriette	142	“ She has had an enormous influence upon her . She has taught Hadria to see that one may hold one 's own ideas quietly , without flying in everybody 's face . Lady Engleton is a pronounced agnostic , yet she never misses a Sunday at Craddock Church , and I am glad to see that Hadria is following her example . It must be a great satisfaction to you , Hubert . People used to talk unpleasantly about Hadria 's extremely irregular attendance . It is such a mistake to offend people 's ideas , in a small place like this . ”
177586	177594	177596	177596	Hubert	118	“ That is what I told Hadria , ”
177598	177646	177596	177596	Hubert	118	“ and her mother has been speaking seriously to her on the subject . Hadria made no opposition , rather to my surprise . She said that she would go as regularly as our dining - room clock , if it gave us all so much satisfaction . ”
177647	177651	177653	177653	Henriette	142	“ How charming ! ”
177656	177661	177653	177653	Henriette	142	“ and how characteristic ! ”
177842	177854	177881	177881	Algitha	81	“ I wonder what is the secret of success , Hadria ? ”
177855	177868	177881	177881	Algitha	81	“ Speaking generally , I should say to have a petty aim . ”
177869	177879	177881	177881	Algitha	81	“ Then if one succeeds after a long struggle , ”
177884	177898	177881	177881	Algitha	81	“ One finds it , I doubt not , the dismalest of failures . ”
178795	178798	178800	178801	Lady Engleton	176	“ Futile ? ”
178803	178831	178800	178801	Lady Engleton	176	“ I think women are generally fools , entre nous ; that is why they so often fill their lives with sound and fury , accomplishing nothing . ”
178854	178868	178869	178869	she	211	“ I can understand so well how it is that women become conventional , ”
178881	178912	178869	178869	she	211	“ it is so useless to take the trouble to act on one 's own initiative . It annoys everybody frightfully , and it accomplishes nothing , as you say . ”
178913	178922	178924	178925	Lady Engleton	176	“ My dear Hadria , you alarm me ! ”
178929	178946	178924	178925	Lady Engleton	176	“ You must really be very ill indeed , if you have come to this conclusion ! ”
179574	179615	179569	179569	she	520	“ Indeed , the only tie that we respect is that of our love and faith . If that failed , we should scorn to hold one another in unwilling bondage . We are not entirely without self - respect . ”
180017	180029	180031	180031	Dodge	286	“ I 'm real glad , mum , that I be , ”
180033	180095	180031	180031	Dodge	286	“ to think as you has your sister with you again . There ai n't nobody like one 's kith and kin , wen things is n't quite as they should be , as one may say . Miss Fullerton — which I means Mrs. Burton — is sure to do you a sight o ' good , bless ' er . ”
180529	180543	180545	180545	Hadria	211	“ No ; I do n't think it is all for the best , ”
180547	180647	180545	180545	Hadria	211	“ I think , as far as my influence goes , it is all for the worst . What fatal argument my life will give to those who are seeking reasons to hold our sex in the old bondage ! My struggles , my failure , will add to the staggering weight that we all stumble under . I have hindered more — that is the bitter thing — by having tried and failed , than if I had never tried at all . Mrs. Walker , Mrs. Gordon herself , has given less arguments to the oppressors than I. ”
180648	180655	180657	180657	Algitha	81	“ But why ? But how ? ”
180660	180789	180791	180791	Hadria	211	“ Because no one can point to them , as they will to me , and say , ‘ See , what a ghastly failure ! See how feeble after all , are these pretentious women of the new order , who begin by denying the sufficiency of the life assigned them , by common consent , and end by failing in that and in the other which they aspire to . What has become of all the talent and all the theories and resolves ? ’ And so the next girl who dares to have ambitions , and dares to scorn the rôle of adventuress that society allots to her , will have the harder fate because of my attempt . Now nothing in the whole world , ”
180806	180824	180793	180793	her	211	“ nothing in the whole world will ever persuade me that that is all for the best ! ”
180825	180848	180793	180793	her	211	“ I never said it was , but when a thing has to be , why not make the best of it ? ”
180849	180928	180929	180929	Algitha	81	“ And so persuade people that all is well , when all is not well ! That 's exactly what women always do and always have done , and plume themselves upon it . And so this ridiculous farce is kept up , because these wretched women go smiling about the world , hugging their stupid resignation to their hearts , and pampering up their sickly virtue , at the expense of their sex . Hang their virtue ! ”
180932	180950	180929	180929	Algitha	81	“ It is somewhat self - regarding certainly , in spite of the incessant renunciation and sacrifice . ”
180951	180979	180981	180981	Hadria	211	“ Oh , self - sacrifice in a woman , is always her easiest course . It is the nearest approach to luxury that society allows her , ”
180985	181003	181004	181005	her sister	313	“ It is most refreshing to hear you exaggerate , once more , with the old vigour , ”
181008	181021	181023	181023	Hadria	211	“ If I have a foible , it is under - statement , ”
181031	181041	181043	181043	Algitha	81	“ Then I think you have n't a foible , ”
181045	181080	181043	181043	Algitha	81	“ That I am ready to admit ; but seriously , women seem bent on proving that you may treat them as you like , but they will ‘ never desert Mr. Micawber . ’ ”
181084	181158	181081	181081	Algitha	81	“ They are so mortally afraid of getting off the line and doing what might not be quite right . They take such a morbid interest in their own characters . They are so particular about their souls . The female soul is such a delicate creation — like a bonnet . Look at a woman trimming and poking at her bonnet — that 's exactly how she goes on with her soul . ”
181166	181181	181182	181182	she	81	“ It has trained her in a sort of heroism , at any rate , ”
181185	181251	181182	181182	she	81	“ Heroism ! talk of Spartan boys , they are not in it ! A woman will endure martyrdom with the expression of a seraph,—an extremely aggravating seraph . She looks after her soul as if it were the ultimate fact of the universe . She will trim and preen that ridiculous soul , though the heavens fall and the rest of her sex perish . ”
181252	181262	181381	181381	Hadria	211	“ Come now , I think there are exceptions . ”
181263	181303	181311	181311	Algitha	81	“ A few , but very few . It is a point of honour , a sacred canon . Women will go on patiently drawing water in sieves , and pretend they are usefully employed because it tires them ! ”
181304	181309	181311	181311	Algitha	81	“ They believe it , ”
181313	181323	181311	181311	Algitha	81	“ Perhaps so . But it 's very silly . ”
181324	181342	181311	181311	Algitha	81	“ It is really well meant . It is a submission to the supposed will of heaven . ”
181343	181350	181351	181351	Hadria	211	“ A poor compliment to Heaven ! ”
181354	181380	181351	181351	Hadria	211	“ Well , it is not , of course , your conception nor mine of the will of heaven , but it is their 's . ”
181386	181413	181381	181381	Hadria	211	“ I wish women would think a little less of Heaven in the abstract , and a little more of one another , in the concrete . ”
181414	181459	181311	181311	Algitha	81	“ Nobody has ever taught them to think of one another ; on the contrary , they have always been trained to think of men , and of Heaven , and their souls . That training accounts for their attitude towards their own sex . ”
181460	181500	181311	181311	Algitha	81	“ I suppose so . A spirit of sisterhood among women would have sadly upset the social scheme , as it has been hitherto conceived . Indeed the social scheme has made such a spirit well - nigh impossible . ”
181501	181529	181381	181381	Hadria	211	“ A conquering race , if it is wise , governs its subjects largely through their internecine squabbles and jealousies . But what if they combine — ? ”
181530	181533	181381	181381	Hadria	211	“ Ah ! ”
181540	181552	181534	181534	Hadria	211	“ I wish the moment of sisterhood were a little nearer . ”
181553	181558	181560	181560	Algitha	81	“ Heaven hasten it ! ”
181562	181619	181560	181560	Algitha	81	“ Perhaps it is nearer than we imagine . Women are quick learners , when they begin . But , oh , it is hard sometimes to make them begin . They are so annoyingly abject ; so painfully diffident . It is their pride to be humble . The virtuous worm wo n't even turn ! ”
181620	181634	181636	181636	Algitha	81	“ Poor worm ! It sometimes permits itself the relief of verbal expression ! ”
181641	181655	181638	181638	Hadria	211	“ There are smiling , villainous worms , who deny themselves even that ! ”
181693	181696	181661	181661	Algitha	81	“ turn , ”
181703	181712	181714	181714	Hadria	211	“ Oh , I can not even turn ! ”
181716	181748	181749	181749	Algitha	81	“ Necessity knows no law . The one thing I wo n't do , is to be virtuously resigned . And I wo n't ‘ make the best of it . ’ ”
181752	181775	181749	181749	Algitha	81	“ I am relieved to hear so wrong - headed a sentiment from you . It sounds more like your old self . ”
181776	181789	181791	181791	Hadria	211	“ I wo n't be called wrong - headed on this account , ”
181793	181996	181997	181997	she	3557	“ If my life is to bear testimony to the truth , its refrain ought to be , ‘ This is wrong , this is futile , this is cruel , this is damnable . ’ I shall warn every young woman I come across , to beware , as she grows older , and has people in her clutches , not to express her affection by making unlimited demands on the beloved objects . nor by turning the world into a prison - house for those whom she honours with her devotion . The hope of the future lies in the rising generation . You ca n't alter those who have matured in the old ideas . It is for us to warn . I wo n't pretend to think that things are all right , when I know they are not all right . That would be mean . What is called making the best of it , would testify all the wrong way . My life , instead of being a warning , would be a sort of a trap . Let me at least play the humble role of scarcecrow . I am in excellent condition for it , ”
182011	182015	182016	182016	she	3557	“ I fear , ”
182019	182071	182016	182016	she	3557	“ that the moral that most people will draw will be : ‘ Follow in the path of Mrs. Gordon , however distasteful it may seem to you , and whatever temptations you feel towards a more independent life . If you do n't , you will come to grief . ’ ”
182072	182094	182005	182005	Algitha	81	“ Then you think it would be better to be ‘ resigned , ’ and look after one 's own soul ? ”
182095	182103	182104	182104	Algitha	81	“ Heaven knows what would be better ! ”
182107	182129	182104	182104	Algitha	81	“ But one thing is certain , you ought to look after your body , for the present at any rate . ”
182482	182546	182469	182470	The caretaker	1693	“ Why ma'am , I thought you was never coming again to play on the piano : I have missed it , that I have . It makes the old place seem that cheerful — I can almost fancy it 's my poor young mistress come back again . She used to sit and play on that piano , by the hour together . ”
182547	182556	182558	182558	Hadria	211	“ I am glad you have enjoyed it , ”
182585	182601	182602	182603	the woman	4547	“ You have n't had much time for playing since your mamma has been ill , ”
182617	182637	182639	182639	Hadria	211	“ To - day my mother has a visitor ; Mrs. Joseph Fleming is spending the afternoon with her , ”
182641	182661	182663	182665	the good woman	753	“ To be sure , ma'am , to be sure , a nice young lady , and so cheerful , ”
182696	182702	182704	182705	the caretaker	1693	“ Seems more cheerful like , ”
182721	182733	182735	182735	Hadria	211	“ And have you fed my birds regularly , Mrs. Williams ? ”
182753	182788	182735	182735	Hadria	211	“ Yes indeed , ma'am , every day , just as you used to do when you came yourself . And they has got so tame ; they almost eats out of my hand . ”
182789	182802	182704	182705	the caretaker	1693	“ And my robin ? I hope he has not deserted us . ”
182803	182855	182704	182705	the caretaker	1693	“ Oh , no , he comes right into the room sometimes and hops about , just as he did that afternoon , the last time you was here ! I think it 's the same bird , for he likes to perch on that table and pick up the crumbs . ”
182856	182874	182875	182876	The caretaker	1693	“ Poor little soul ! If you will give me a scrap of bread , Mrs. Williams — ”
183570	183584	183589	183589	she	211	“ Good heavens ! are all doors going to be shut against me ? ”
183607	183610	183589	183589	she	211	“ unless . ”
183846	183857	183858	183858	Hadria	211	“ I ca n't , I ca n't endure it ! ”
184121	184130	184093	184095	some suffering soul	3597	“ It is all absurd , all futile ! ”
184141	184467	184093	184095	some suffering soul	3597	“ and meanwhile the steady pulse of life beats on , not pausing while we battle out our days , not waiting while we decide how we shall live . We are possessed by a sentiment , an ideal , a religion ; old Time makes no comment , but moves quietly on ; we fling the thing aside as tawdry , insufficient ; the ideal is tarnished , experience of the world converts us — and still unmoved , he paces on . We are off on another chase ; another conception of things possesses us ; and still the beat of his footstep sounds in our ears , above the tumult . We think and aspire and dream , and meanwhile the fires grow cold upon the hearth , the daily cares and common needs plead eloquently for our undivided service ; the stupendous movement of Existence goes on unceasingly , at our doors ; thousands struggling for gold and fame and mere bread , and resorting to infamous devices to obtain them ; the great commercial currents flow and flow , according to their mystic laws ; the price of stocks goes up , goes down , and with them , the life and fate of thousands ; the inconsequent bells ring out from Craddock Church , and the people congregate ; the grave of the schoolmistress sleeps in the sunshine , and the sound of the bells streams over it — meaning no irony — to lose itself in the quiet of the hills ; rust and dust collect in one 's house , in one 's soul ; and this and that , and that and this,—like the pendulum of the old time - piece , with its solemn tick — dock the moments of one 's life , with each its dull little claim and its tough little tether , and lead one decorously to the gateway of Eternity . ”
184661	184676	184624	184624	he	3603	“ But they break my heart , little singer , they break my heart ! ”
184707	184846	184895	184895	him	3603	“ I know it all , I know it all , and my heart is broken — and it is my own fault — and it does not matter — the world is full of broken hearts — and it does not matter , it does not matter . But , oh , if the pain might stop , if the pain might stop ! The robin sings now , because the spring is here ; but it is not always spring . And some day — perhaps not this winter , but some day — the dear little brown body will agonize — it will die alone , in the horrible great universe ; one thinks little of a robin , but it agonizes all the same when its time comes ; it agonizes all the same . ”
184913	185019	184897	184900	the dust - motes	3609	“ It is very lovely , it is very lovely — the world is a miracle , but it is all like a taunt , it is like an insult , this glory of the world . I am born a woman , and to be born a woman is to be exquisitely sensitive to insult and to live under it always , always . I wish that I were as marble to the magic of Life , I wish that I cared for nothing and felt nothing . I pray only that the dream and the longing may be killed , and killed quickly ! ”
185080	185113	185114	185115	The robin	3603	“ But you do not understand , you do not understand , little soul that sings — the spring is torturing me and taunting me . If only it would kill me ! ”
185187	185200	185166	185166	Reason	196	“ If I might only die , if I might only die ! ”
185208	185212	185202	185204	the little bird	3614	“ QUITE hopeless ! ”
185220	185223	185225	185226	Lady Engleton	176	“ Yes , ”
185228	185235	185225	185226	Lady Engleton	176	“ it is the terrible truth . ”
185276	185286	185288	185288	Joseph	291	“ I understand they are all at the Priory , ”
185290	185346	185288	185288	Joseph	291	“ Yes ; Miss Du Prel telegraphed to Mrs. Temperley , and Mrs. Temperley and I put our heads together and arranged matters as well as we could in the emergency , so that the Professor 's wish might be gratified . He desired to return to the Priory , where his boyhood was spent . ”
185347	185355	185430	185430	he	159	“ And is there really no hope ? ”
185356	185365	185430	185430	he	159	“ None at all , the doctor says . ”
185366	185373	185375	185375	Joseph	291	“ Dear me , dear me ! ”
185377	185389	185375	185375	Joseph	291	“ And is he not expected to live through the summer ? ”
185390	185409	185430	185430	he	159	“ The summer ! ah no , Mr. Fleming , he is not expected to live many days . ”
185410	185417	185430	185430	he	159	“ Dear me , dear me ! ”
185433	185450	185430	185430	he	159	“ I fear Mrs. Temperley will feel it very much . They were such old friends . ”
185451	185463	185430	185430	he	159	“ Oh ! poor woman , she is heart - broken . ”
185529	185541	185542	185542	he	4071	“ I am so glad I have seen the spring again , ”
185545	185557	185542	185542	he	4071	“ and hat I am here , in the old home . ”
185686	185702	185703	185703	he	4071	“ I ca n't tell you what pleasure and comfort your music is to me , ”
185712	185806	185703	185703	he	4071	“ It has been so ever since I knew you . When I think of the thousands of poor devils who have to end their lives in some wretched , lonely , sordid fashion , after hardships and struggles and very little hope , I ca n't help feeling that I am fortunate indeed , now and all through my life . I have grumbled at times , and there have been sharp experiences — few escape those — but take it all round , I have had my share of good things . ”
186097	186110	186112	186112	Valeria	109	“ It shall be our business to see that it is not , ”
186134	186205	186122	186123	The Professor	4071	“ My earlier work is safe ; what I have done in other directions , is already a part of human knowledge and resource , but this is just the sort of thing that might be so easily lost and forgotten . These sufferings are hidden , and when people do not see a wrong , they do not think of it ; make them think , make them think ! ”
186335	186345	186347	186348	the Professor	4071	“ Do n't be too sure , old friend , ”
186350	186364	186347	186348	the Professor	4071	“ do n't be too sure of anything , in this mysterious universe . ”
186594	186609	186610	186610	she	109	“ Ca n't we save him ? ca n't we save him , Hadria ? ”
186621	186642	186610	186610	she	109	“ Surely , surely there is some hope . Science makes such professions ; why does n't it do something ? ”
186643	186657	186677	186677	her	109	“ Ah , do n't torture yourself with false hope , dear Valeria . ”
186658	186668	186677	186677	her	109	“ The world is monstrous , life is unbearable , ”
186738	186743	186744	186744	he	3652	“ Do you know , ”
186747	186848	186744	186744	he	3652	“ I have found , of late , that many of my old fixed ideas have been insidiously modifying . So many things that I used to regard as preposterous have been borne in upon me , in a singular fashion , as by no means so out of the question . I have had one or two strange experiences and now a hope — I might say a faith — has settled upon me of an undying element in our personality . I feel that we shall meet again those we have loved here — some time or another . ”
186849	186862	186864	186864	Hadria	211	“ What a sting that would take from the agony of parting , ”
186866	186983	186864	186864	Hadria	211	“ And , after all , is it less rational to suppose that there is some survival of the Self , and that the wild , confused earthly experience is an element of a spiritual evolutionary process , than to suppose that the whole universe is chaotic and meaningless ? For what we call mind exists , and it must be contained in the sum - total of existence , or how could it arise out of it ? Therefore , some reasonable scheme appears more likely than a reasonless one . And then there is that other big fact that stares us in the face and puts one 's fears to shame : human goodness . ”
187007	187050	187003	187003	she	211	“ What earthly business has such a thing as goodness or pity to appear in a fortuitous , mindless , soulless universe ? Where does it come from ? What is its origin ? Whence sprang the laws that gave it birth ? ”
187051	187064	187065	187065	she	211	“ It gives more argument to faith than any thing I know , ”
187068	187085	187065	187065	she	211	“ even if there had been but one good man or woman since the world began . ”
187086	187127	187003	187003	she	211	“ Ah , yes ; the pity and tenderness that lie in the heart of man , even of the worst , if only they can be appealed to before they die , may teach us to hope all things . ”
187185	187198	187200	187201	the Professor	4071	“ I have been for many years without one gleam of hope , ”
187204	187262	187200	187201	the Professor	4071	“ It is only lately that some of my obstinate preconceptions have begun to yield to other suggestions and other thoughts , which have opened up a thousand possibilities and a thousand hopes . And I have not been false to my reason in this change ; I have but followed it more fearlessly and more faithfully . ”
187263	187269	187271	187271	Hadria	211	“ I have sometimes thought , ”
187273	187306	187271	187271	Hadria	211	“ that when we seem to cling most desperately to our reason , we are really refusing to accept its guidance into unfamiliar regions . We confuse the familiar with the reasonable . ”
187307	187350	187200	187201	the Professor	4071	“ Exactly . And I want you to be on your guard against that intellectual foible , which I believe has held me back in a region of sadness and solitude that I need not have lingered in , but for that . ”
187521	187534	187535	187535	he	3652	“ And if the scheme of the universe be a reasonable one , ”
187540	187634	187535	187535	he	3652	“ then one can account better for the lives that never fulfil themselves ; the apparent failure that saddens one , in such numberless instances , especially among women . For in that case , the failure is only apparent , however cruel and however great . If the effort has been sincere , and the thought bent upon the best that could be conceived by the particular soul , then that effort and that thought must play their part in the upward movement of the race . I can not believe otherwise . ”
187658	187763	187641	187641	Her	211	“ To believe that all the better and more generous hopes of our kind are to be lost and ineffectual , that genius is finally wasted , and goodness an exotic to be trampled under foot in the blind movements of Nature — that requires more power of faith than I can muster . Once believe that thought is the main factor , the motive force of the universe , then everything settles into its place , and we have room for hope ; indeed it insists upon admission ; it falls into the shadow of our life like that blessed ray of sunlight . ”
187775	187834	187641	187641	Her	211	“ The hope leads me far . My training has been all against it , but it comes to me with greater and greater force . It makes me feel that presently , when we have bid one another farewell , it will not be for ever . We shall meet again , dear Hadria , believe me . ”
187847	187891	187835	187835	She	211	“ I wish so much that I could leave this hope , as a legacy to you . I wish I could leave it to Valeria . Take care of her , wo n't you ? She is very solitary and very sad . ”
187892	187899	187900	187900	Hadria	211	“ I will , I will , ”
187903	187948	187900	187900	Hadria	211	“ Do not turn away from the light of rational hope , if any path should open up that leads that way . And help her to do the same . When you think of me , let it be happily and with comfort . ”
187954	188065	188067	188067	He	3664	“ And hold fast to your own colours . Do n't take sides , above all , with the powers that have oppressed you . They are terrible powers , and yet people wo n't admit their strength , and so they are left unopposed . It is worse than folly to underrate the forces of the enemy . It is always worse than folly to deny facts in order to support a theory . Exhort people to face and conquer them . You can help more than you dream , even as things stand . I can not tell you what you have done for me , dear Hadria . ”
188076	188120	188121	188122	The speaker	306	“ And the helpless , human and animal — how they wring one 's heart ! Do not forget them ; be to them a knight - errant . You have suffered enough yourself , to know well how to bind their wounds . ”
188137	188144	188145	188145	he	3664	“ There is so much anguish , ”
188149	188223	188145	188145	he	3664	“ so much intolerable anguish , even when things seem smoothest . The human spirit craves for so much , and generally it gets so little . The world is full of tragedy ; and sympathy , a little common sympathy , can do so much to soften the worst of grief . It is for the lack of that , that people despair and go down . I commend them to you . ”
188506	188513	188514	188514	she	109	“ I ca n't understand it ! ”
188524	188561	188514	188514	she	109	“ I ca n't believe he will never speak to me again ! It 's a horrible dream — oh , but too horrible — ah , why ca n't I die as well as he ? ”
188630	188635	188637	188637	Valeria	109	“ What 's that ? ”
188650	188654	188656	188656	Hadria	211	“ The robin ! ”
