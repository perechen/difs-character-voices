915	948	842	843	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ You must n’t tell us about the ring , here . Very well , then . Describe your father as a horsebreaker . He doctors sick horses , I dare say ? ’

956	982	842	843	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Very well , then . He is a veterinary surgeon , a farrier , and horsebreaker . Give me your definition of a horse . ’

1803	1814	1857	1858	the gentleman	281	‘ Of course , No . Why would n’t you ? ’
1849	1855	1857	1858	the gentleman	281	‘ You must paper it , ’

1874	1899	1871	1872	Thomas Gradgrind	71	‘ whether you like it or not . Do n’t tell us you would n’t paper it . What do you mean , boy ? ’
1900	1909	1911	1912	the gentleman	281	‘ I ’ll explain to you , then , ’
1921	1956	1911	1912	the gentleman	281	‘ why you would n’t paper a room with representations of horses . Do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in reality — in fact ? Do you ? ’
1957	1962	1871	1872	Thomas Gradgrind	71	‘ Yes , sir ! ’
1967	1972	1974	1975	the other	287	‘ No , sir ! ’
1977	1982	1984	1985	the gentleman	281	‘ Of course no , ’
1996	2043	1984	1985	the gentleman	281	‘ Why , then , you are not to see anywhere , what you do n’t see in fact ; you are not to have anywhere , what you do n’t have in fact . What is called Taste , is only another name for Fact . ’
2050	2064	2066	2067	the gentleman	281	‘ This is a new principle , a discovery , a great discovery , ’
2069	2100	2066	2067	the gentleman	281	‘ Now , I ’ll try you again . Suppose you were going to carpet a room . Would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it ? ’
2110	2115	2153	2154	the gentleman	281	‘ No , sir ! ’
2146	2151	2153	2154	the gentleman	281	‘ Girl number twenty , ’
2171	2205	2207	2208	the gentleman	281	‘ So you would carpet your room — or your husband ’s room , if you were a grown woman , and had a husband — with representations of flowers , would you ? ’
2210	2215	2207	2208	the gentleman	281	‘ Why would you ? ’
2216	2230	2232	2233	the girl	262	‘ If you please , sir , I am very fond of flowers , ’
2235	2259	2232	2233	the girl	262	‘ And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them , and have people walking over them with heavy boots ? ’
2260	2300	2207	2208	the gentleman	281	‘ It would n’t hurt them , sir . They would n’t crush and wither , if you please , sir . They would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant , and I would fancy — ’
2301	2314	2316	2317	the gentleman	281	‘ Ay , ay , ay ! But you must n’t fancy , ’
2329	2340	2316	2317	the gentleman	281	‘ That ’s it ! You are never to fancy . ’
2341	2349	2207	2208	the gentleman	281	‘ You are not , Cecilia Jupe , ’
2355	2363	2350	2351	Thomas Gradgrind	71	‘ to do anything of that kind . ’
2364	2371	2373	2374	the gentleman	281	‘ Fact , fact , fact ! ’
2377	2384	2386	2387	Thomas Gradgrind	71	‘ Fact , fact , fact ! ’
2389	2401	2403	2404	the gentleman	281	‘ You are to be in all things regulated and governed , ’
2406	2561	2563	2564	the gentleman	281	‘ by fact . We hope to have , before long , a board of fact , composed of commissioners of fact , who will force the people to be a people of fact , and of nothing but fact . You must discard the word Fancy altogether . You have nothing to do with it . You are not to have , in any object of use or ornament , what would be a contradiction in fact . You do n’t walk upon flowers in fact ; you can not be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets . You do n’t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery ; you can not be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery . You never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls ; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls . You must use , ’
2566	2605	2563	2564	the gentleman	281	‘ for all these purposes , combinations and modifications ( in primary colours ) of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration . This is the new discovery . This is fact . This is taste . ’
2639	2646	2648	2649	the gentleman	281	‘ Now , if Mr. M’Choakumchild , ’
2651	2680	2648	2649	the gentleman	281	‘ will proceed to give his first lesson here , Mr. Gradgrind , I shall be happy , at your request , to observe his mode of procedure . ’
2687	2697	2681	2682	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Mr. M’Choakumchild , we only wait for you . ’
3759	3816	3817	3821	an eminently practical ’ father	2833	’ sake , that the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped it ! Their father walked on in a hopeful and satisfied frame of mind . He was an affectionate father , after his manner ; but he would probably have described himself ( if he had been put , like Sissy Jupe , upon a definition ) as ‘
3820	3984	3817	3821	an eminently practical ’ father	2833	’ father . He had a particular pride in the phrase eminently practical , which was considered to have a special application to him . Whatsoever the public meeting held in Coketown , and whatsoever the subject of such meeting , some Coketowner was sure to seize the occasion of alluding to his eminently practical friend Gradgrind . This always pleased the eminently practical friend . He knew it to be his due , but his due was acceptable . He had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts of the town , which was neither town nor country , and yet was either spoiled , when his ears were invaded by the sound of music . The clashing and banging band attached to the horse - riding establishment , which had there set up its rest in a wooden pavilion , was in full bray . A flag , floating from the summit of the temple , proclaimed to mankind that it was ‘
3990	4079	3817	3821	an eminently practical ’ father	2833	’ which claimed their suffrages . Sleary himself , a stout modern statue with a money - box at its elbow , in an ecclesiastical niche of early Gothic architecture , took the money . Miss Josephine Sleary , as some very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced , was then inaugurating the entertainments with her graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower - act . Among the other pleasing but always strictly moral wonders which must be seen to be believed , Signor Jupe was that afternoon to ‘
4092	4098	4099	4099	his	88	’ He was also to exhibit ‘
4158	4165	4174	4174	his	88	’ The same Signor Jupe was to ‘
4181	4206	4174	4174	his	88	’ Lastly , he was to wind them up by appearing in his favourite character of Mr. William Button , of Tooley Street , in ‘
4223	4320	4174	4174	his	88	’ Thomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course , but passed on as a practical man ought to pass on , either brushing the noisy insects from his thoughts , or consigning them to the House of Correction . But , the turning of the road took him by the back of the booth , and at the back of the booth a number of children were congregated in a number of stealthy attitudes , striving to peep in at the hidden glories of the place . This brought him to a stop . ‘
4329	4333	4326	4327	these vagabonds	350	’ said he , ‘
4343	4466	4335	4337	the young rabble	351	’ A space of stunted grass and dry rubbish being between him and the young rabble , he took his eyeglass out of his waistcoat to look for any child he knew by name , and might order off . Phenomenon almost incredible though distinctly seen , what did he then behold but his own metallurgical Louisa , peeping with all her might through a hole in a deal board , and his own mathematical Thomas abasing himself on the ground to catch but a hoof of the graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower - act ! Dumb with amazement , Mr. Gradgrind crossed to the spot where his family was thus disgraced , laid his hand upon each erring child , and said : ‘
4473	4516	4470	4470	Thomas	71	’ Both rose , red and disconcerted . But , Louisa looked at her father with more boldness than Thomas did . Indeed , Thomas did not look at him , but gave himself up to be taken home like a machine . ‘
4528	4540	4335	4337	the young rabble	351	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , leading each away by a hand ; ‘
4547	4548	4543	4543	you	92	’ ‘
4557	4563	4543	4543	you	92	’ returned Louisa , shortly . ‘
4569	4570	4573	4573	father	2781	’ ‘
4575	4733	4573	4573	father	2781	’ There was an air of jaded sullenness in them both , and particularly in the girl : yet , struggling through the dissatisfaction of her face , there was a light with nothing to rest upon , a fire with nothing to burn , a starved imagination keeping life in itself somehow , which brightened its expression . Not with the brightness natural to cheerful youth , but with uncertain , eager , doubtful flashes , which had something painful in them , analogous to the changes on a blind face groping its way . She was a child now , of fifteen or sixteen ; but at no distant day would seem to become a woman all at once . Her father thought so as he looked at her . She was pretty . Would have been self - willed ( he thought in his eminently practical way ) but for her bringing - up . ‘
4770	4771	4751	4751	you	71	’ ‘
4778	4784	4772	4772	I	0	’ said Louisa , quickly . ‘
4791	4792	4793	4793	I	0	’ ‘
4823	4839	4840	4840	You	0	’ She looked at her father again , but no tear fell down her cheek . ‘
4888	4893	4884	4884	you	0	’ cried Mr. Gradgrind . ‘
4903	4904	4905	4905	I	0	’ ‘
4919	4923	4911	4911	I	0	’ said Louisa . ‘
4929	4935	4936	4936	I	0	’ asked the astonished father . ‘
4949	4950	4946	4946	I	0	’ ‘
4956	4961	4946	4946	I	0	’ returned Mr. Gradgrind . ‘
4972	4998	4966	4966	I	0	’ He did not speak again until they had walked some half - a - mile in silence , when he gravely broke out with : ‘
5024	5069	5020	5021	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ At the mention of this name , his daughter stole a look at him , remarkable for its intense and searching character . He saw nothing of it , for before he looked at her , she had again cast down her eyes ! ‘
5072	5077	5079	5080	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ he repeated presently , ‘
5083	5106	5079	5080	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ All the way to Stone Lodge , as with grave indignation he led the two delinquents home , he repeated at intervals ‘
5113	5521	5109	5110	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ — as if Mr. Bounderby had been Mrs. Grundy . Not being Mrs. Grundy , who was Mr. Bounderby ? Why , Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind ’s bosom friend , as a man perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach that spiritual relationship towards another man perfectly devoid of sentiment . So near was Mr. Bounderby — or , if the reader should prefer it , so far off . He was a rich man : banker , merchant , manufacturer , and what not . A big , loud man , with a stare , and a metallic laugh . A man made out of a coarse material , which seemed to have been stretched to make so much of him . A man with a great puffed head and forehead , swelled veins in his temples , and such a strained skin to his face that it seemed to hold his eyes open , and lift his eyebrows up . A man with a pervading appearance on him of being inflated like a balloon , and ready to start . A man who could never sufficiently vaunt himself a self - made man . A man who was always proclaiming , through that brassy speaking - trumpet of a voice of his , his old ignorance and his old poverty . A man who was the Bully of humility . A year or two younger than his eminently practical friend , Mr. Bounderby looked older ; his seven or eight and forty might have had the seven or eight added to it again , without surprising anybody . He had not much hair . One might have fancied he had talked it off ; and that what was left , all standing up in disorder , was in that condition from being constantly blown about by his windy boastfulness . In the formal drawing - room of Stone Lodge , standing on the hearthrug , warming himself before the fire , Mr. Bounderby delivered some observations to Mrs. Gradgrind on the circumstance of its being his birthday . He stood before the fire , partly because it was a cool spring afternoon , though the sun shone ; partly because the shade of Stone Lodge was always haunted by the ghost of damp mortar ; partly because he thus took up a commanding position , from which to subdue Mrs. Gradgrind . ‘
5588	5658	5581	5581	I	0	’ Mrs. Gradgrind , a little , thin , white , pink - eyed bundle of shawls , of surpassing feebleness , mental and bodily ; who was always taking physic without any effect , and who , whenever she showed a symptom of coming to life , was invariably stunned by some weighty piece of fact tumbling on her ; Mrs. Gradgrind hoped it was a dry ditch ? ‘
5674	5679	5727	5727	ma’am	361	’ said Mr. Bounderby . ‘
5687	5692	5683	5685	a baby cold	360	’ Mrs. Gradgrind considered . ‘
5718	5723	5709	5709	I	0	’ returned Mr. Bounderby . ‘
5774	5795	5762	5762	you	363	’ Mrs. Gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs , as the most appropriate thing her imbecility could think of doing . ‘
5807	5811	5797	5797	I	0	’ said Bounderby . ‘
5857	5868	5869	5870	My mother	367	’ Mrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his mother — ‘
5876	5893	5874	5874	ma’am	361	’ said Bounderby . Mrs. Gradgrind , stunned as usual , collapsed and gave it up . ‘
5902	5906	5894	5895	My mother	367	’ said Bounderby ; ‘
5946	5950	5943	5943	she	370	’em off and sell ’em
5979	6018	6019	6019	She	370	’ Mrs. Gradgrind , weakly smiling , and giving no other sign of vitality , looked ( as she always did ) like an indifferently executed transparency of a small female figure , without enough light behind it . ‘
6026	6030	6019	6019	She	370	’ pursued Bounderby , ‘
6133	6176	6177	6177	I	0	’ His pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social distinction as to be a nuisance , an incumbrance , and a pest , was only to be satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast . ‘
6429	6488	6490	6490	your	97	’ Being heated when he arrived at this climax , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown stopped . He stopped just as his eminently practical friend , still accompanied by the two young culprits , entered the room . His eminently practical friend , on seeing him , stopped also , and gave Louisa a reproachful look that plainly said , ‘
6493	6494	6490	6490	your	97	’ ‘
6497	6502	6490	6490	your	97	’ blustered Mr. Bounderby , ‘
6517	6530	6511	6511	Thomas	71	’ He spoke of young Thomas , but he looked at Louisa . ‘
6538	6550	6552	6552	father	2781	’ muttered Louisa , haughtily , without lifting up her eyes , ‘
6556	6557	6552	6552	father	2781	’ ‘
6563	6572	6560	6561	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	’ said her husband in a lofty manner , ‘
6586	6587	6560	6561	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	’ ‘
6591	6596	6589	6589	me	0	’ whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind . ‘
6613	6653	6610	6610	I	0	’re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all . I have a great mind to say I wish I had n’t . Then what would you have done , I should like to know ? ’
6670	6704	6706	6707	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ As if , with my head in its present throbbing state , you could n’t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you , instead of circuses ! ’
6709	6791	6706	6707	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ You know , as well as I do , no young people have circus masters , or keep circuses in cabinets , or attend lectures about circuses . What can you possibly want to know of circuses then ? I am sure you have enough to do , if that ’s what you want . With my head in its present state , I could n’t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to . ’
6792	6798	6800	6800	Louisa	92	‘ That ’s the reason ! ’
6802	6822	6824	6825	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ Do n’t tell me that ’s the reason , because it ca n’t be nothing of the sort , ’
6827	6834	6824	6825	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ Go and be somethingological directly . ’
6912	6915	6921	6921	he	71	‘ no nonsense ’
7002	7005	7007	7008	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Bounderby , ’
7017	7089	7007	7008	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ you are always so interested in my young people — particularly in Louisa — that I make no apology for saying to you , I am very much vexed by this discovery . I have systematically devoted myself ( as you know ) to the education of the reason of my family . The reason is ( as you know ) the only faculty to which education should be addressed . ‘
7168	7169	7162	7162	their	417	’ ‘
7185	7189	7162	7162	their	417	’ returned Bounderby . ‘
7209	7210	7205	7205	I	0	’ ‘
7229	7239	7223	7223	his	421	‘ in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise ? ’
7240	7252	7223	7223	his	421	‘ I ’ll tell you in what . In idle imagination . ’
7253	7258	7223	7223	his	421	‘ I hope not , ’
7264	7281	7223	7223	his	421	‘ I confess , however , that the misgiving has crossed me on my way home . ’
7282	7289	7291	7291	Bounderby	93	‘ In idle imagination , Gradgrind , ’
7293	7353	7291	7291	Bounderby	93	‘ A very bad thing for anybody , but a cursed bad thing for a girl like Louisa . I should ask Mrs. Gradgrind ’s pardon for strong expressions , but that she knows very well I am not a refined character . Whoever expects refinement in me will be disappointed . I had n’t a refined bringing up . ’
7354	7357	7363	7363	his	422	‘ Whether , ’
7377	7445	7370	7370	his	422	‘ whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything ? Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading anything ? Whether , in spite of all precautions , any idle story - book can have got into the house ? Because , in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line , from the cradle upwards , this is so curious , so incomprehensible . ’
7446	7451	7453	7453	Bounderby	93	‘ Stop a bit ! ’
7482	7489	7453	7453	Bounderby	93	‘ You have one of those strollers ’
7495	7496	7453	7453	Bounderby	93	’ ‘
7503	7518	7497	7498	Cecilia Jupe	76	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , with something of a stricken look at his friend . ‘
7525	7530	7497	7498	Cecilia Jupe	76	’ cried Bounderby again . ‘
7537	7538	7533	7533	she	76	’ ‘
7593	7594	7589	7589	you	93	’ ‘
7601	7608	7609	7609	Louisa	92	’ cried Bounderby , once more . ‘

7648	7649	7633	7633	Louisa	92	’ ‘

7671	7676	7652	7653	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	’ returned Mrs. Gradgrind . ‘
7733	7734	7712	7713	Mr. Gradgrind	71	’ ‘

7833	7838	7830	7830	you	95	’ asked his friend . ‘

7866	7871	7847	7847	you	95	’ said Mr. Bounderby , ‘
7881	7935	7936	7936	I	0	’ So , Mr. Bounderby threw on his hat — he always threw it on , as expressing a man who had been far too busily employed in making himself , to acquire any fashion of wearing his hat — and with his hands in his pockets , sauntered out into the hall . ‘
7941	7949	7936	7936	I	0	’ it was his custom to say . ‘
7972	8119	7969	7969	I	0	’ Being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while Mr. Gradgrind went up - stairs for the address , he opened the door of the children ’s study and looked into that serene floor - clothed apartment , which , notwithstanding its book - cases and its cabinets and its variety of learned and philosophical appliances , had much of the genial aspect of a room devoted to hair - cutting . Louisa languidly leaned upon the window looking out , without looking at anything , while young Thomas stood sniffing revengefully at the fire . Adam Smith and Malthus , two younger Gradgrinds , were out at lecture in custody ; and little Jane , after manufacturing a good deal of moist pipe - clay on her face with slate - pencil and tears , had fallen asleep over vulgar fractions . ‘
8136	8141	8133	8134	young Thomas	71	’ said Mr. Bounderby ; ‘
8176	8177	8164	8164	Louisa	92	’ ‘
8186	8217	8178	8178	You	0	’ returned Louisa , when she had coldly paused , and slowly walked across the room , and ungraciously raised her cheek towards him , with her face turned away . ‘
8228	8233	8226	8226	Louisa	92	’ said Mr. Bounderby . ‘
8240	8281	8238	8238	Louisa	92	’ He went his way , but she stood on the same spot , rubbing the cheek he had kissed , with her handkerchief , until it was burning red . She was still doing this , five minutes afterwards . ‘
8289	8295	8284	8284	you	92	’ her brother sulkily remonstrated . ‘
8305	8306	8296	8296	You	92	’ ‘
8327	9313	8322	8322	I	0	’ Coketown , to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked , was a triumph of fact ; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind herself . Let us strike the key - note , Coketown , before pursuing our tune . It was a town of red brick , or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it ; but as matters stood , it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage . It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys , out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever , and never got uncoiled . It had a black canal in it , and a river that ran purple with ill - smelling dye , and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long , and where the piston of the steam - engine worked monotonously up and down , like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy madness . It contained several large streets all very like one another , and many small streets still more like one another , inhabited by people equally like one another , who all went in and out at the same hours , with the same sound upon the same pavements , to do the same work , and to whom every day was the same as yesterday and to - morrow , and every year the counterpart of the last and the next . These attributes of Coketown were in the main inseparable from the work by which it was sustained ; against them were to be set off , comforts of life which found their way all over the world , and elegancies of life which made , we will not ask how much of the fine lady , who could scarcely bear to hear the place mentioned . The rest of its features were voluntary , and they were these . You saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely workful . If the members of a religious persuasion built a chapel there — as the members of eighteen religious persuasions had done — they made it a pious warehouse of red brick , with sometimes ( but this is only in highly ornamental examples ) a bell in a birdcage on the top of it . The solitary exception was the New Church ; a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the door , terminating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden legs . All the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike , in severe characters of black and white . The jail might have been the infirmary , the infirmary might have been the jail , the town - hall might have been either , or both , or anything else , for anything that appeared to the contrary in the graces of their construction . Fact , fact , fact , everywhere in the material aspect of the town ; fact , fact , fact , everywhere in the immaterial . The M’Choakumchild school was all fact , and the school of design was all fact , and the relations between master and man were all fact , and everything was fact between the lying - in hospital and the cemetery , and what you could n’t state in figures , or show to be purchaseable in the cheapest market and saleable in the dearest , was not , and never should be , world without end , Amen . A town so sacred to fact , and so triumphant in its assertion , of course got on well ? Why no , not quite well . No ? Dear me ! No . Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces , in all respects like gold that had stood the fire . First , the perplexing mystery of the place was , Who belonged to the eighteen denominations ? Because , whoever did , the labouring people did not . It was very strange to walk through the streets on a Sunday morning , and note how few of them the barbarous jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad , called away from their own quarter , from their own close rooms , from the corners of their own streets , where they lounged listlessly , gazing at all the church and chapel going , as at a thing with which they had no manner of concern . Nor was it merely the stranger who noticed this , because there was a native organization in Coketown itself , whose members were to be heard of in the House of Commons every session , indignantly petitioning for acts of parliament that should make these people religious by main force . Then came the Teetotal Society , who complained that these same people would get drunk , and showed in tabular statements that they did get drunk , and proved at tea parties that no inducement , human or Divine ( except a medal ) , would induce them to forego their custom of getting drunk . Then came the chemist and druggist , with other tabular statements , showing that when they did n’t get drunk , they took opium . Then came the experienced chaplain of the jail , with more tabular statements , outdoing all the previous tabular statements , and showing that the same people would resort to low haunts , hidden from the public eye , where they heard low singing and saw low dancing , and mayhap joined in it ; and where A. B. , aged twenty - four next birthday , and committed for eighteen months ’

10049	10059	10061	10062	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Was this boy running after you , Jupe ? ’
10064	10069	10071	10072	the girl	262	‘ Yes , sir , ’

10336	10390	10333	10334	his friend	2921	‘ Bitzer , turn you about and take yourself home . Jupe , stay here a moment . Let me hear of your running in this manner any more , boy , and you will hear of me through the master of the school . You understand what I mean . Go along . ’
10414	10419	10421	10422	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Now , girl , ’
10424	10451	10421	10422	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ take this gentleman and me to your father ’s ; we are going there . What have you got in that bottle you are carrying ? ’
10452	10455	10457	10458	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ Gin , ’
10460	10473	10457	10458	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ Dear , no , sir ! It ’s the nine oils . ’
10474	10478	10480	10481	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ The what ? ’
10483	10495	10480	10481	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ The nine oils , sir , to rub father with . ’

10510	10524	10501	10502	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ what the devil do you rub your father with nine oils for ? ’
10525	10545	10547	10548	the girl	262	‘ It ’s what our people aways use , sir , when they get any hurts in the ring , ’
10564	10572	10547	10548	the girl	262	‘ They bruise themselves very bad sometimes . ’

10774	10796	10797	10797	She	487	‘ This is it , sir , and — if you would n’t mind , sir — this is the house . ’

10933	10945	10929	10929	his	93	‘ Pretty well this , for a self - made man ! ’
11152	11162	11163	11163	she	262	‘ Father is not in our room , sir , ’
11173	11188	11163	11163	she	262	‘ If you would n’t mind walking in , I ’ll find him directly . ’

11465	11471	11473	11474	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ What does she mean ! ’
11476	11490	11473	11474	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Back in a minute ? It ’s more than a mile off . ’

11633	11853	11855	11855	your	504	’ provender , and sawdust ; and looked a most remarkable sort of Centaur , compounded of the stable and the play - house . Where the one began , and the other ended , nobody could have told with any precision . This gentleman was mentioned in the bills of the day as Mr. E. W. B. Childers , so justly celebrated for his daring vaulting act as the Wild Huntsman of the North American Prairies ; in which popular performance , a diminutive boy with an old face , who now accompanied him , assisted as his infant son : being carried upside down over his father ’s shoulder , by one foot , and held by the crown of his head , heels upwards , in the palm of his father ’s hand , according to the violent paternal manner in which wild huntsmen may be observed to fondle their offspring . Made up with curls , wreaths , wings , white bismuth , and carmine , this hopeful young person soared into so pleasing a Cupid as to constitute the chief delight of the maternal part of the spectators ; but in private , where his characteristics were a precocious cutaway coat and an extremely gruff voice , he became of the Turf , turfy . ‘
11860	11873	11855	11855	your	504	’ said Mr. E. W. B. Childers , glancing round the room . ‘

12250	12271	12272	12273	Mr. Childers	109	‘ Did n’t do what he ought to do . Was short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling , ’

12284	12292	12281	12282	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ that is tip , is it ? ’
12293	12304	12305	12309	Mr. E. W. B. Childers	109	‘ In a general way that ’s missing his tip , ’
12312	12330	12335	12335	his	93	‘ Nine oils , Merrylegs , missing tips , garters , banners , and Ponging , eh ! ’
12340	12356	12335	12335	his	93	‘ Queer sort of company , too , for a man who has raised himself ! ’

12391	12399	12401	12402	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ This is a very obtrusive lad ! ’
12413	12433	12435	12436	Master Kidderminster	111	‘ We ’d have had a young gentleman to meet you , if we had known you were coming , ’

13294	13313	13292	13292	Childers	109	‘ Because this is n’t a strong building , and too much of you might bring it down ! ’

13419	13446	13448	13448	Childers	109	‘ Because those two were one . Because they were never asunder . Because , up to this time , he seemed to dote upon her , ’

I suppose , however , he had this move in his mind — he was always half - cracked — and then considered her provided for . If you should happen to have looked in to - night , for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service , ’
13949	13967	13946	13946	his	109	‘ it would be very fortunate and well - timed ; very fortunate and well - timed . ’
13968	13973	13975	13976	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ On the contrary , ’
13978	14032	13975	13976	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I came to tell him that her connections made her not an object for the school , and that she must not attend any more . Still , if her father really has left her , without any connivance on her part — Bounderby , let me have a word with you . ’
14079	14097	14074	14075	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ No . I say no . I advise you not . I say by no means . ’
14114	14155	14107	14107	his	71	‘ But even as an example to Louisa , of what this pursuit which has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity , leads to and ends in . Think of it , Bounderby , in that point of view . ’
14578	14581	14583	14584	Mr. Sleary	88	‘ Thquire ! ’

14696	14710	14712	14713	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I shall have something to propose to her when she comes back , ’
14715	14746	14712	14713	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Glad to hear it , Thquire . Not that I want to get rid of the child , any more than I want to thtand in her way . I ’m

14987	15071	14978	14978	Father	108	’ Then came Sissy Jupe , running into the room as she had run out of it . And when she saw them all assembled , and saw their looks , and saw no father there , she broke into a most deplorable cry , and took refuge on the bosom of the most accomplished tight - rope lady ( herself in the family - way ) , who knelt down on the floor to nurse her , and to weep over her . ‘
15083	15087	14978	14978	Father	108	’ said Sleary . ‘
15150	15209	15212	15213	good people	583	’ It was so pathetic to hear her saying many things of this kind , with her face turned upward , and her arms stretched out as if she were trying to stop his departing shadow and embrace it , that no one spoke a word until Mr. Bounderby ( growing impatient ) took the case in hand . ‘
15216	15220	15212	15213	good people	583	’ said he , ‘

15342	15360	15361	15361	I	0	’ and Sleary , in some haste , communicated the following hint , apart to Mr. Bounderby . ‘

16239	16243	16245	16246	Mr. Sleary	88	‘ Well known , ’

16325	16511	16320	16320	I	0	’ The women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes together — it was soon done , for they were not many — and to pack them in a basket which had often travelled with them . Sissy sat all the time upon the ground , still sobbing , and covering her eyes . Mr. Gradgrind and his friend Bounderby stood near the door , ready to take her away . Mr. Sleary stood in the middle of the room , with the male members of the company about him , exactly as he would have stood in the centre of the ring during his daughter Josephine ’s performance . He wanted nothing but his whip . The basket packed in silence , they brought her bonnet to her , and smoothed her disordered hair , and put it on . Then they pressed about her , and bent over her in very natural attitudes , kissing and embracing her : and brought the children to take leave of her ; and were a tender - hearted , simple , foolish set of women altogether . ‘
16516	16521	16514	16514	Jupe	76	’ said Mr. Gradgrind . ‘
16530	16675	16523	16523	you	76	’ But she had to take her farewell of the male part of the company yet , and every one of them had to unfold his arms ( for they all assumed the professional attitude when they found themselves near Sleary ) , and give her a parting kiss — Master Kidderminster excepted , in whose young nature there was an original flavour of the misanthrope , who was also known to have harboured matrimonial views , and who moodily withdrew . Mr. Sleary was reserved until the last . Opening his arms wide he took her by both her hands , and would have sprung her up and down , after the riding - master manner of congratulating young ladies on their dismounting from a rapid act ; but there was no rebound in Sissy , and she only stood before him crying . ‘
16683	16687	16523	16523	you	76	’ said Sleary . ‘
16761	16799	16744	16744	he	2783	’ With that he regarded her attentively with his fixed eye , surveyed his company with his loose one , kissed her , shook his head , and handed her to Mr. Gradgrind as to a horse . ‘
16806	16826	16744	16744	he	2783	’ he said , sweeping her with a professional glance as if she were being adjusted in her seat , ‘
16839	16840	16845	16845	Cecilia	76	’ ‘
16847	16848	16845	16845	Cecilia	76	’ ‘

16931	16941	16923	16923	me	0	’ she said , in another burst of tears . ‘

17345	17349	17341	17342	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ a Powler . ’
17457	17829	17833	17833	sir	2771	’ Court . The late Mr. Sparsit , being by the mother ’s side a Powler , married this lady , being by the father ’s side a Scadgers . Lady Scadgers ( an immensely fat old woman , with an inordinate appetite for butcher ’s meat , and a mysterious leg which had now refused to get out of bed for fourteen years ) contrived the marriage , at a period when Sparsit was just of age , and chiefly noticeable for a slender body , weakly supported on two long slim props , and surmounted by no head worth mentioning . He inherited a fair fortune from his uncle , but owed it all before he came into it , and spent it twice over immediately afterwards . Thus , when he died , at twenty - four ( the scene of his decease , Calais , and the cause , brandy ) , he did not leave his widow , from whom he had been separated soon after the honeymoon , in affluent circumstances . That bereaved lady , fifteen years older than he , fell presently at deadly feud with her only relative , Lady Scadgers ; and , partly to spite her ladyship , and partly to maintain herself , went out at a salary . And here she was now , in her elderly days , with the Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows which had captivated Sparsit , making Mr. Bounderby ’s tea as he took his breakfast . If Bounderby had been a Conqueror , and Mrs. Sparsit a captive Princess whom he took about as a feature in his state - processions , he could not have made a greater flourish with her than he habitually did . Just as it belonged to his boastfulness to depreciate his own extraction , so it belonged to it to exalt Mrs. Sparsit ’s . In the measure that he would not allow his own youth to have been attended by a single favourable circumstance , he brightened Mrs. Sparsit ’s juvenile career with every possible advantage , and showered waggon - loads of early roses all over that lady ’s path . ‘
17835	17840	17833	17833	sir	2771	’ he would say , ‘
17883	18050	17878	17879	Josiah Bounderby	97	’ Nay , he made this foil of his so very widely known , that third parties took it up , and handled it on some occasions with considerable briskness . It was one of the most exasperating attributes of Bounderby , that he not only sang his own praises but stimulated other men to sing them . There was a moral infection of clap - trap in him . Strangers , modest enough elsewhere , started up at dinners in Coketown , and boasted , in quite a rampant way , of Bounderby . They made him out to be the Royal arms , the Union - Jack , Magna Charta , John Bull , Habeas Corpus , the Bill of Rights , An Englishman ’s house is his castle , Church and State , and God save the Queen , all put together . And as often ( and it was very often ) as an orator of this kind brought into his peroration , ‘
18072	18095	18096	18097	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ — it was , for certain , more or less understood among the company that he had heard of Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
18099	18104	18096	18097	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , ‘

18197	18202	18177	18177	ma’am	361	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , ‘

18429	18451	18426	18427	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ and there being two little girls in question , I did not know which might be indicated by that expression . ’

18513	18566	18489	18489	she	126	‘ If you had said I was another father to Tom — young Tom , I mean , not my friend Tom Gradgrind — you might have been nearer the mark . I am going to take young Tom into my office . Going to have him under my wing , ma’am . ’
18567	18581	18582	18583	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Indeed ? Rather young for that , is he not , sir ? ’
18585	18588	18582	18583	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ sir , ’

18836	18847	18831	18831	I	0	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , with a dignity serenely mournful , ‘

18977	18986	18972	18972	I	0	’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , with decent resignation , ‘

19150	19183	19129	19129	I	0	’ Mr. Bounderby was obliged to get up from table , and stand with his back to the fire , looking at her ; she was such an enhancement of his position . ‘
19195	19203	19185	19185	you	2771	’ he said , warming his legs . ‘
19210	19235	19208	19208	sir	2771	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , with an affectation of humility the very opposite of his , and therefore in no danger of jostling it . ‘
19250	19255	19236	19236	You	2771	’ said Mr. Bounderby . ‘
19260	19274	19258	19258	sir	2771	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , with a kind of social widowhood upon her . ‘
19280	19328	19258	19258	sir	2771	’ Mr. Bounderby , bending himself at the knees , literally embraced his legs in his great satisfaction and laughed aloud . Mr. and Miss Gradgrind being then announced , he received the former with a shake of the hand , and the latter with a kiss . ‘
19337	19394	19330	19330	Jupe	76	’ asked Mr. Gradgrind . Certainly . So Jupe was sent there . On coming in , she curtseyed to Mr. Bounderby , and to his friend Tom Gradgrind , and also to Louisa ; but in her confusion unluckily omitted Mrs. Sparsit . Observing this , the blustrous Bounderby had the following remarks to make : ‘
19546	19547	19548	19548	I	0	’ ‘
19553	19563	19548	19548	I	0	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , in a conciliatory voice , ‘
19571	19572	19573	19574	My friend	508	’ ‘
19582	19586	19579	19580	Mrs. Sparsit	126	’ said Bounderby , ‘

19626	19639	19624	19624	sir	2771	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , shaking her head with her State humility . ‘
19647	19704	19705	19705	Jupe	76	’ Sissy , who all this time had been faintly excusing herself with tears in her eyes , was now waved over by the master of the house to Mr. Gradgrind . She stood looking intently at him , and Louisa stood coldly by , with her eyes upon the ground , while he proceeded thus : ‘
19811	19812	19815	19815	sir	2771	’ ‘
19819	19825	19815	19815	sir	2771	’ she answered , curtseying . ‘
19897	19917	19893	19893	I	0	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , beckoning her nearer to him before he said so , and dropping his voice . ‘
19939	19940	19934	19934	Merrylegs	106	’ ‘
19947	19957	19945	19945	Jupe	76	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , with a passing frown . ‘
19980	19981	19967	19967	you	679	’ ‘
20010	20027	19992	19992	They	706	’ It was only now when her sorrow broke out , that Louisa looked at her . ‘
20031	20042	20044	20044	you	679	’ asked Mr. Gradgrind , in a still lower voice , ‘
20052	20053	20044	20044	you	679	’ ‘
20072	20077	20044	20044	you	679	’ she sobbed out ; ‘
20081	20082	20044	20044	you	679	’ ‘
20085	20090	20044	20044	you	679	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , ‘
20124	20125	20106	20106	Bounderby	93	’ ‘
20128	20133	20106	20106	Bounderby	93	’ returned Mr. Bounderby , ‘
20169	20269	20270	20270	Tom	71	’ So , Mr. Gradgrind and his daughter took Cecilia Jupe off with them to Stone Lodge , and on the way Louisa never spoke one word , good or bad . And Mr. Bounderby went about his daily pursuits . And Mrs. Sparsit got behind her eyebrows and meditated in the gloom of that retreat , all the evening . Let us strike the key - note again , before pursuing the tune . When she was half a dozen years younger , Louisa had been overheard to begin a conversation with her brother one day , by saying ‘
20274	20295	20296	20296	Louisa	92	’ — upon which Mr. Gradgrind , who was the person overhearing , stepped forth into the light and said , ‘
20301	20762	20272	20272	I	0	’ Herein lay the spring of the mechanical art and mystery of educating the reason without stooping to the cultivation of the sentiments and affections . Never wonder . By means of addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division , settle everything somehow , and never wonder . Bring to me , says M’Choakumchild , yonder baby just able to walk , and I will engage that it shall never wonder . Now , besides very many babies just able to walk , there happened to be in Coketown a considerable population of babies who had been walking against time towards the infinite world , twenty , thirty , forty , fifty years and more . These portentous infants being alarming creatures to stalk about in any human society , the eighteen denominations incessantly scratched one another ’s faces and pulled one another ’s hair by way of agreeing on the steps to be taken for their improvement — which they never did ; a surprising circumstance , when the happy adaptation of the means to the end is considered . Still , although they differed in every other particular , conceivable and inconceivable ( especially inconceivable ) , they were pretty well united on the point that these unlucky infants were never to wonder . Body number one , said they must take everything on trust . Body number two , said they must take everything on political economy . Body number three , wrote leaden little books for them , showing how the good grown - up baby invariably got to the Savings - bank , and the bad grown - up baby invariably got transported . Body number four , under dreary pretences of being droll ( when it was very melancholy indeed ) , made the shallowest pretences of concealing pitfalls of knowledge , into which it was the duty of these babies to be smuggled and inveigled . But , all the bodies agreed that they were never to wonder . There was a library in Coketown , to which general access was easy . Mr. Gradgrind greatly tormented his mind about what the people read in this library : a point whereon little rivers of tabular statements periodically flowed into the howling ocean of tabular statements , which no diver ever got to any depth in and came up sane . It was a disheartening circumstance , but a melancholy fact , that even these readers persisted in wondering . They wondered about human nature , human passions , human hopes and fears , the struggles , triumphs and defeats , the cares and joys and sorrows , the lives and deaths of common men and women ! They sometimes , after fifteen hours ’
20852	20875	20880	20881	Thomas Gradgrind	71	‘ I am sick of my life , Loo . I , hate it altogether , and I hate everybody except you , ’
20891	20900	20880	20881	Thomas Gradgrind	71	‘ You do n’t hate Sissy , Tom ? ’
20901	20917	20919	20919	Tom	71	‘ I hate to be obliged to call her Jupe . And she hates me , ’
20923	20936	20919	20919	Tom	71	‘ No , she does not , Tom , I am sure ! ’
20937	20941	20943	20943	Tom	71	‘ She must , ’
20945	20994	20943	20943	Tom	71	‘ She must just hate and detest the whole set - out of us . They ’ll bother her head off , I think , before they have done with her . Already she ’s getting as pale as wax , and as heavy as — I am . ’
21053	21058	21060	21060	Tom	71	‘ As to me , ’
21074	21117	21060	21060	Tom	71	‘ I am a Donkey , that ’s what I am . I am as obstinate as one , I am more stupid than one , I get as much pleasure as one , and I should like to kick like one . ’
21118	21127	21070	21070	his	71	‘ Not me , I hope , Tom ? ’
21128	21161	21162	21162	Tom	71	‘ No , Loo ; I would n’t hurt you . I made an exception of you at first . I do n’t know what this — jolly old — Jaundiced Jail , ’
21195	21201	21162	21162	Tom	71	‘ would be without you . ’
21202	21215	21162	21162	Tom	71	‘ Indeed , Tom ? Do you really and truly say so ? ’
21216	21233	21235	21235	Tom	71	‘ Why , of course I do . What ’s the use of talking about it ! ’
21262	21267	21269	21270	his sister	716	‘ Because , Tom , ’
21279	21386	21269	21270	his sister	716	‘ as I get older , and nearer growing up , I often sit wondering here , and think how unfortunate it is for me that I ca n’t reconcile you to home better than I am able to do . I do n’t know what other girls know . I ca n’t play to you , or sing to you . I ca n’t talk to you so as to lighten your mind , for I never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about , when you are tired . ’
21387	21413	21434	21435	a Prig	720	‘ Well , no more do I. I am as bad as you in that respect ; and I am a Mule too , which you ’re
21455	21461	21452	21452	I	0	’ said Tom , desperately . ‘
21468	21485	21492	21492	Tom	71	’ said Louisa , after another pause , and speaking thoughtfully out of her dark corner : ‘
21503	21504	21507	21507	You	725	’ ‘
21509	21513	21507	21507	You	725	’ said Tom ; ‘
21567	21568	21558	21558	you	725	’ ‘
21611	21626	21627	21627	I	0	’ She came and kissed him , and went back into her corner again . ‘
21641	21650	21653	21654	the Figures	732	’ said Tom , spitefully setting his teeth , ‘
21703	21704	21705	21705	Your	0	’ ‘
21710	21711	21705	21705	Your	0	’ ‘
21748	21749	21733	21733	I	0	’ ‘
21779	21780	21759	21760	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ ‘
21783	21789	21759	21760	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ said Tom , laughing ; ‘
21809	21888	21806	21807	old Bounderby	93	’ Their shadows were defined upon the wall , but those of the high presses in the room were all blended together on the wall and on the ceiling , as if the brother and sister were overhung by a dark cavern . Or , a fanciful imagination — if such treason could have been there — might have made it out to be the shadow of their subject , and of its lowering association with their future . ‘
21906	21907	21933	21933	his	93	’ ‘
21910	21914	21933	21933	his	93	’ said Tom , ‘
22008	22058	21985	21985	she	738	’ After waiting for some answering remark , and getting none , Tom wearily relapsed into the present time , and twined himself yawning round and about the rails of his chair , and rumpled his head more and more , until he suddenly looked up , and asked : ‘
22067	22068	22065	22065	Loo	101	’ ‘
22080	22081	22073	22073	I	0	’ ‘
22098	22102	22082	22082	You	101	’ said Tom . ‘
22116	22117	22118	22118	Tom	71	’ ‘
22120	22154	22118	22118	Tom	71	’ enquired his sister , slowly , and in a curious tone , as if she were reading what she asked in the fire , and it was not quite plainly written there , ‘
22170	22171	22156	22156	you	71	’ ‘
22184	22198	22255	22255	Loo	101	’ returned Tom , pushing his chair from him , and standing up ; ‘
22207	22208	22255	22255	Loo	101	’ ‘
22219	22228	22255	22255	Loo	101	’ Louisa repeated in her former curious tone ; ‘
22239	22240	22255	22255	Loo	101	’ ‘
22308	22309	22312	22312	Tom	71	’ ‘
22314	22367	22312	22312	Tom	71	’ The answer was so long in coming , though there was no indecision in it , that Tom went and leaned on the back of her chair , to contemplate the fire which so engrossed her , from her point of view , and see what he could make of it . ‘
22375	22379	22305	22305	you	101	’ said Tom , ‘
22404	22405	22406	22406	I	0	’ ‘
22439	22440	22427	22427	I	0	’ ‘
22444	22448	22427	22427	I	0	’ said Tom . ‘
22455	22460	22427	22427	I	0	’ returned his sister , ‘
22466	22467	22462	22462	they	743	’ ‘
22476	22490	22469	22469	I	0	’ said Mrs. Gradgrind , who had opened the door without being heard , ‘
22500	22582	22583	22583	Louisa	92	’ sake , you inconsiderate girl , or I shall never hear the last of it from your father . And , Thomas , it is really shameful , with my poor head continually wearing me out , that a boy brought up as you have been , and whose education has cost what yours has , should be found encouraging his sister to wonder , when he knows his father has expressly said that she is not to do it . ’
22602	22636	22596	22596	her	92	‘ Louisa , do n’t tell me , in my state of health ; for unless you had been encouraged , it is morally and physically impossible that you could have done it . ’
22637	22690	22593	22594	her mother	744	‘ I was encouraged by nothing , mother , but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire , and whitening and dying . It made me think , after all , how short my life would be , and how little I could hope to do in it . ’
22691	22694	22696	22697	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ Nonsense ! ’
22703	22836	22696	22697	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ Nonsense ! Do n’t stand there and tell me such stuff , Louisa , to my face , when you know very well that if it was ever to reach your father ’s ears I should never hear the last of it . After all the trouble that has been taken with you ! After the lectures you have attended , and the experiments you have seen ! After I have heard you myself , when the whole of my right side has been benumbed , going on with your master about combustion , and calcination , and calorification , and I may say every kind of ation that could drive a poor invalid distracted , to hear you talking in this absurd way about sparks and ashes ! I wish , ’
22859	22888	22838	22839	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ yes , I really do wish that I had never had a family , and then you would have known what it was to do without me ! ’
23239	23249	23270	23271	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ What is the first principle of this science ? ’
23254	23269	23270	23271	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ To do unto others as I would that they should do unto me . ’
23320	23327	23319	23319	Jupe	76	‘ must be kept to it . ’
23345	23359	23360	23360	she	76	‘ It would be a fine thing to be you , Miss Louisa ! ’
23382	23388	23360	23360	she	76	‘ Do you think so ? ’
23389	23413	23360	23360	she	76	‘ I should know so much , Miss Louisa . All that is difficult to me now , would be so easy then . ’
23414	23426	23360	23360	she	76	‘ You might not be the better for it , Sissy . ’
23435	23446	23427	23427	Sissy	76	‘ I should not be the worse , Miss Louisa . ’
23453	23460	23449	23450	Miss Louisa	92	‘ I do n’t know that . ’
23533	23553	23554	23554	Louisa	92	‘ You are more useful to my mother , and more pleasant with her than I can ever be , ’
23557	23570	23554	23554	Louisa	92	‘ You are pleasanter to yourself , than I am to myself . ’
23571	23581	23582	23582	Sissy	76	‘ But , if you please , Miss Louisa , ’
23585	23593	23594	23594	Louisa	92	‘ I am — O so stupid ! ’
23615	23621	23623	23623	Sissy	76	‘ You do n’t know , ’
23628	23676	23623	23623	Sissy	76	‘ what a stupid girl I am . All through school hours I make mistakes . Mr. and Mrs. M’Choakumchild call me up , over and over again , regularly to make mistakes . I ca n’t help them . They seem to come natural to me . ’
23677	23693	23594	23594	Louisa	92	‘ Mr. and Mrs. M’Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves , I suppose , Sissy ? ’
23694	23698	23699	23699	she	92	‘ O no ! ’
23703	23708	23699	23699	she	92	‘ They know everything . ’
23709	23717	23594	23594	Louisa	92	‘ Tell me some of your mistakes . ’
23718	23724	23726	23726	Sissy	76	‘ I am almost ashamed , ’
23731	23750	23726	23726	Sissy	76	‘ But to - day , for instance , Mr. M’Choakumchild was explaining to us about Natural Prosperity . ’
23751	23761	23763	23763	Louisa	92	‘ National , I think it must have been , ’
23765	23779	23780	23780	she	92	‘ Yes , it was . — But is n’t it the same ? ’
23784	23797	23799	23799	Louisa	92	‘ You had better say , National , as he said so , ’
23806	23860	23799	23799	Louisa	92	‘ National Prosperity . And he said , Now , this schoolroom is a Nation . And in this nation , there are fifty millions of money . Is n’t this a prosperous nation ? Girl number twenty , is n’t this a prosperous nation , and a’n’t you in a thriving state ? ’
23861	23867	23869	23869	Louisa	92	‘ What did you say ? ’
23871	23943	23945	23945	Sissy	76	‘ Miss Louisa , I said I did n’t know . I thought I could n’t know whether it was a prosperous nation or not , and whether I was in a thriving state or not , unless I knew who had got the money , and whether any of it was mine . But that had nothing to do with it . It was not in the figures at all , ’
23951	23960	23962	23962	Louisa	92	‘ That was a great mistake of yours , ’
23964	24087	23962	23962	Louisa	92	‘ Yes , Miss Louisa , I know it was , now . Then Mr. M’Choakumchild said he would try me again . And he said , This schoolroom is an immense town , and in it there are a million of inhabitants , and only five - and - twenty are starved to death in the streets , in the course of a year . What is your remark on that proportion ? And my remark was — for I could n’t think of a better one — that I thought it must be just as hard upon those who were starved , whether the others were a million , or a million million . And that was wrong , too . ’
24088	24094	23962	23962	Louisa	92	‘ Of course it was . ’
24095	24116	23962	23962	Louisa	92	‘ Then Mr. M’Choakumchild said he would try me once more . And he said , Here are the stutterings — ’
24117	24120	24122	24122	Louisa	92	‘ Statistics , ’
24124	24199	24122	24122	Louisa	92	‘ Yes , Miss Louisa — they always remind me of stutterings , and that ’s another of my mistakes — of accidents upon the sea . And I find ( Mr. M’Choakumchild said ) that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages , and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death . What is the percentage ? And I said , Miss ; ’
24214	24221	24201	24201	Sissy	76	‘ I said it was nothing . ’
24222	24227	24327	24327	she	92	‘ Nothing , Sissy ? ’
24228	24250	24252	24252	Sissy	76	‘ Nothing , Miss — to the relations and friends of the people who were killed . I shall never learn , ’
24254	24298	24252	24252	Sissy	76	‘ And the worst of all is , that although my poor father wished me so much to learn , and although I am so anxious to learn , because he wished me to , I am afraid I do n’t like it . ’
24330	24351	24327	24327	she	92	‘ Did your father know so much himself , that he wished you to be well taught too , Sissy ? ’
24375	24401	24372	24372	Louisa	92	‘ No one hears us ; and if any one did , I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question . ’
24402	24408	24410	24410	Sissy	76	‘ No , Miss Louisa , ’
24420	24460	24410	24410	Sissy	76	‘ father knows very little indeed . It ’s as much as he can do to write ; and it ’s more than people in general can do to read his writing . Though it ’s plain to me . ’
24461	24465	24372	24372	Louisa	92	‘ Your mother ? ’
24466	24485	24486	24486	Sissy	76	‘ Father says she was quite a scholar . She died when I was born . She was ; ’
24493	24499	24486	24486	Sissy	76	‘ she was a dancer . ’
24500	24507	24372	24372	Louisa	92	‘ Did your father love her ? ’
24539	24582	24372	24372	Louisa	92	‘ O yes ! As dearly as he loves me . Father loved me , first , for her sake . He carried me about with him when I was quite a baby . We have never been asunder from that time . ’
24583	24592	24372	24372	Louisa	92	‘ Yet he leaves you now , Sissy ? ’
24593	24658	24372	24372	Louisa	92	‘ Only for my good . Nobody understands him as I do ; nobody knows him as I do . When he left me for my good — he never would have left me for his own — I know he was almost broken - hearted with the trial . He will not be happy for a single minute , till he comes back . ’
24659	24666	24668	24668	Louisa	92	‘ Tell me more about him , ’
24670	24683	24668	24668	Louisa	92	‘ I will never ask you again . Where did you live ? ’
24684	24704	24705	24705	Sissy	76	‘ We travelled about the country , and had no fixed place to live in . Father ’s a ; ’
24711	24715	24705	24705	Sissy	76	‘ a clown . ’
24716	24723	24725	24725	Louisa	92	‘ To make the people laugh ? ’
24733	24839	24725	24725	Louisa	92	‘ Yes . But they would n’t laugh sometimes , and then father cried . Lately , they very often would n’t laugh , and he used to come home despairing . Father ’s not like most . Those who did n’t know him as well as I do , and did n’t love him as dearly as I do , might believe he was not quite right . Sometimes they played tricks upon him ; but they never knew how he felt them , and shrunk up , when he was alone with me . He was far , far timider than they thought ! ’
24840	24849	24850	24850	She	757	‘ And you were his comfort through everything ? ’
24861	24970	24850	24850	She	757	‘ I hope so , and father said I was . It was because he grew so scared and trembling , and because he felt himself to be a poor , weak , ignorant , helpless man ( those used to be his words ) , that he wanted me so much to know a great deal , and be different from him . I used to read to him to cheer his courage , and he was very fond of that . They were wrong books — I am never to speak of them here — but we did n’t know there was any harm in them . ’
24971	24977	24979	24979	Louisa	92	‘ And he liked them ? ’
24991	25052	24979	24979	Louisa	92	‘ O very much ! They kept him , many times , from what did him real harm . And often and often of a night , he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the Sultan would let the lady go on with the story , or would have her head cut off before it was finished . ’
25053	25065	25067	25067	Louisa	92	‘ And your father was always kind ? To the last ? ’
25078	25083	25085	25085	Sissy	76	‘ Always , always ! ’
25091	25119	25120	25120	she	92	‘ Kinder and kinder than I can tell . He was angry only one night , and that was not to me , but Merrylegs . Merrylegs ; ’
25126	25132	25120	25120	she	92	‘ is his performing dog . ’
25133	25142	25143	25143	Louisa	92	‘ Why was he angry with the dog ? ’
25146	25307	25143	25143	Louisa	92	‘ Father , soon after they came home from performing , told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them — which is one of his tricks . He looked at father , and did n’t do it at once . Everything of father ’s had gone wrong that night , and he had n’t pleased the public at all . He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing , and had no compassion on him . Then he beat the dog , and I was frightened , and said , “ Father , father ! Pray do n’t hurt the creature who is so fond of you ! O Heaven forgive you , father , stop ! ” And he stopped , and the dog was bloody , and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms , and the dog licked his face . ’
25333	25375	25308	25308	Louisa	92	‘ Finish by telling me how your father left you , Sissy . Now that I have asked you so much , tell me the end . The blame , if there is any blame , is mine , not yours . ’
25376	25381	25383	25383	Sissy	76	‘ Dear Miss Louisa , ’
25393	25527	25383	25383	Sissy	76	‘ I came home from the school that afternoon , and found poor father just come home too , from the booth . And he sat rocking himself over the fire , as if he was in pain . And I said , “ Have you hurt yourself , father ? ” ( as he did sometimes , like they all did ) , and he said , “ A little , my darling . ” And when I came to stoop down and look up at his face , I saw that he was crying . The more I spoke to him , the more he hid his face ; and at first he shook all over , and said nothing but “ My darling ; ” and “ My love ! ” ’
25560	25571	25573	25574	his sister	716	‘ I am asking Sissy a few questions , Tom , ’
25576	25597	25573	25574	his sister	716	‘ You have no occasion to go away ; but do n’t interrupt us for a moment , Tom dear . ’
25598	25604	25606	25606	Tom	71	‘ Oh ! very well ! ’
25608	25658	25606	25606	Tom	71	‘ Only father has brought old Bounderby home , and I want you to come into the drawing - room . Because if you come , there ’s a good chance of old Bounderby ’s asking me to dinner ; and if you do n’t , there ’s none . ’
25659	25665	25573	25574	his sister	716	‘ I ’ll come directly . ’

I said all the affectionate things to him that came into my heart , and presently he was quiet and I sat down by him , and told him all about the school and everything that had been said and done there . When I had no more left to tell , he put his arms round my neck , and kissed me a great many times . Then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used , for the little hurt he had had , and to get it at the best place , which was at the other end of town from there ; and then , after kissing me again , he let me go . When I had gone down - stairs , I turned back that I might be a little bit more company to him yet , and looked in at the door , and said , “ Father dear , shall I take Merrylegs ? ” Father shook his head and said , “ No , Sissy , no ; take nothing that ’s known to be mine , my darling ; ” and I left him sitting by the fire . Then the thought must have come upon him , poor , poor father ! of going away to try something for my sake ; for when I came back , he was gone . ’

Every letter that I see in Mr. Gradgrind ’s hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes , for I think it comes from father , or from Mr. Sleary about father . Mr. Sleary promised to write as soon as ever father should be heard of , and I trust to him to keep his word . ’

Making his pace at once much quicker and much softer , he darted on until he was very near this figure , then fell into his former walk , and called ‘

The touch had its instantaneous effect . He let them fall , turned a smiling face upon her , and said , as he broke into a good - humoured laugh , ‘
28007	28110	28001	28001	I	0	’ They had walked some distance , and were near their own homes . The woman ’s was the first reached . It was in one of the many small streets for which the favourite undertaker ( who turned a handsome sum out of the one poor ghastly pomp of the neighbourhood ) kept a black ladder , in order that those who had done their daily groping up and down the narrow stairs might slide out of this working world by the windows . She stopped at the corner , and putting her hand in his , wished him good night . ‘
28120	28518	28001	28001	I	0	’ She went , with her neat figure and her sober womanly step , down the dark street , and he stood looking after her until she turned into one of the small houses . There was not a flutter of her coarse shawl , perhaps , but had its interest in this man ’s eyes ; not a tone of her voice but had its echo in his innermost heart . When she was lost to his view , he pursued his homeward way , glancing up sometimes at the sky , where the clouds were sailing fast and wildly . But , they were broken now , and the rain had ceased , and the moon shone , — looking down the high chimneys of Coketown on the deep furnaces below , and casting Titanic shadows of the steam - engines at rest , upon the walls where they were lodged . The man seemed to have brightened with the night , as he went on . His home , in such another street as the first , saving that it was narrower , was over a little shop . How it came to pass that any people found it worth their while to sell or buy the wretched little toys , mixed up in its window with cheap newspapers and pork ( there was a leg to be raffled for to - morrow - night ) , matters not here . He took his end of candle from a shelf , lighted it at another end of candle on the counter , without disturbing the mistress of the shop who was asleep in her little room , and went upstairs into his lodging . It was a room , not unacquainted with the black ladder under various tenants ; but as neat , at present , as such a room could be . A few books and writings were on an old bureau in a corner , the furniture was decent and sufficient , and , though the atmosphere was tainted , the room was clean . Going to the hearth to set the candle down upon a round three - legged table standing there , he stumbled against something . As he recoiled , looking down at it , it raised itself up into the form of a woman in a sitting attitude . ‘
28525	28536	28001	28001	I	0	’ he cried , falling farther off from the figure . ‘
28543	28717	28001	28001	I	0	’ Such a woman ! A disabled , drunken creature , barely able to preserve her sitting posture by steadying herself with one begrimed hand on the floor , while the other was so purposeless in trying to push away her tangled hair from her face , that it only blinded her the more with the dirt upon it . A creature so foul to look at , in her tatters , stains and splashes , but so much fouler than that in her moral infamy , that it was a shameful thing even to see her . After an impatient oath or two , and some stupid clawing of herself with the hand not necessary to her support , she got her hair away from her eyes sufficiently to obtain a sight of him . Then she sat swaying her body to and fro , and making gestures with her unnerved arm , which seemed intended as the accompaniment to a fit of laughter , though her face was stolid and drowsy . ‘
28727	28752	28858	28858	I	0	’ Some hoarse sounds meant for this , came mockingly out of her at last ; and her head dropped forward on her breast . ‘
28756	28773	28858	28858	I	0	’ she screeched , after some minutes , as if he had that moment said it . ‘
28797	28849	28850	28850	I	0	’ Roused by the unmeaning violence with which she cried it out , she scrambled up , and stood supporting herself with her shoulders against the wall ; dangling in one hand by the string , a dunghill - fragment of a bonnet , and trying to look scornfully at him . ‘

Mr. Bounderby stayed her , by holding a mouthful of chop in suspension before swallowing it , and putting out his left hand . Then , withdrawing his hand and swallowing his mouthful of chop , he said to Stephen : ‘

31903	31923	31879	31879	I	0	’ Stephen , subsiding into his quiet manner , and never wandering in his attention , gave a nod . ‘
31944	31945	31694	31695	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ ‘
31952	31957	31694	31695	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ Stephen calmly asked . ‘

32053	32059	32050	32051	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ Perhaps twice the money . ’
32060	32067	32050	32051	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ There ’s no other law ? ’
32068	32072	32081	32081	Stephen	144	‘ Certainly not . ’
32073	32079	32081	32081	Stephen	144	‘ Why then , sir , ’
32105	32106	32081	32081	Stephen	144	‘ ’
32111	32119	32081	32081	Stephen	144	’ Tis just a muddle a’toogether , an ’
32129	32143	32081	32081	Stephen	144	’ ( Mrs. Sparsit again dejected by the impiety of the people . ) ‘
32158	32163	32150	32150	you	0	’ said Mr. Bounderby , ‘
32272	32273	32284	32284	his	144	’ ‘
32274	32279	32281	32281	Stephen	144	’ Tis a muddle , ’
32293	32294	32284	32284	his	144	‘ ’
32297	32301	32284	32284	his	144	’ a muddle ! ’
32302	32311	32312	32313	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ Now , I ’ll tell you what ! ’
32321	32386	32388	32388	he	93	‘ With what I shall call your unhallowed opinions , you have been quite shocking this lady : who , as I have already told you , is a born lady , and who , as I have not already told you , has had her own marriage misfortunes to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds — tens of Thousands of Pounds ! ’
32396	32441	32388	32388	he	93	‘ Now , you have always been a steady Hand hitherto ; but my opinion is , and so I tell you plainly , that you are turning into the wrong road . You have been listening to some mischievous stranger or other — they ’re
32464	32472	32461	32461	you	894	’ here his countenance expressed marvellous acuteness ; ‘
32529	32541	32526	32526	I	0	’ cried Mr. Bounderby , shaking his head with obstinate cunning . ‘
32550	32566	32543	32545	the Lord Harry	118	’ With a very different shake of the head and deep sigh , Stephen said , ‘
32578	32956	32572	32572	I	0	’ So he left Mr. Bounderby swelling at his own portrait on the wall , as if he were going to explode himself into it ; and Mrs. Sparsit still ambling on with her foot in her stirrup , looking quite cast down by the popular vices . Old Stephen descended the two white steps , shutting the black door with the brazen door - plate , by the aid of the brazen full - stop , to which he gave a parting polish with the sleeve of his coat , observing that his hot hand clouded it . He crossed the street with his eyes bent upon the ground , and thus was walking sorrowfully away , when he felt a touch upon his arm . It was not the touch he needed most at such a moment — the touch that could calm the wild waters of his soul , as the uplifted hand of the sublimest love and patience could abate the raging of the sea — yet it was a woman ’s hand too . It was an old woman , tall and shapely still , though withered by time , on whom his eyes fell when he stopped and turned . She was very cleanly and plainly dressed , had country mud upon her shoes , and was newly come from a journey . The flutter of her manner , in the unwonted noise of the streets ; the spare shawl , carried unfolded on her arm ; the heavy umbrella , and little basket ; the loose long - fingered gloves , to which her hands were unused ; all bespoke an old woman from the country , in her plain holiday clothes , come into Coketown on an expedition of rare occurrence . Remarking this at a glance , with the quick observation of his class , Stephen Blackpool bent his attentive face — his face , which , like the faces of many of his order , by dint of long working with eyes and hands in the midst of a prodigious noise , had acquired the concentrated look with which we are familiar in the countenances of the deaf — the better to hear what she asked him . ‘
32961	32967	32959	32959	sir	2771	’ said the old woman , ‘
32981	32989	32972	32972	you	2771	’ pointing back to Mr. Bounderby ’s . ‘
33010	33011	33014	33014	missus	901	’ ‘
33016	33020	33023	33023	me	0	’ returned Stephen , ‘
33025	33026	33023	33023	me	0	’ ‘
33045	33046	33049	33049	missus	901	’ ‘
33051	33052	33049	33049	missus	901	’ ‘
33072	33113	33062	33062	he	281	’ As she straightened her own figure , and held up her head in adapting her action to her words , the idea crossed Stephen that he had seen this old woman before , and had not quite liked her . ‘
33117	33126	33127	33127	he	281	’ he returned , observing her more attentively , ‘
33132	33133	33127	33127	he	281	’ ‘
33137	33143	33062	33062	he	281	’ said the old woman , ‘
33149	33150	33158	33158	He	281	’ ‘
33153	33157	33158	33158	He	281	’ returned Stephen . ‘
33173	33174	33158	33158	He	281	’ ‘
33178	33188	33176	33176	you	2771	’ said the old woman , with infinite content . ‘
33192	33260	33190	33190	you	2771	’ He certainly never had seen this old woman before . Yet there was a vague remembrance in his mind , as if he had more than once dreamed of some old woman like her . She walked along at his side , and , gently accommodating himself to her humour , he said Coketown was a busy place , was it not ? To which she answered ‘
33267	33289	33365	33368	the chatty old woman	906	’ Then he said , she came from the country , he saw ? To which she answered in the affirmative . ‘
33307	33363	33370	33370	her	906	’m going back the same forty mile this afternoon . I walked nine mile to the station this morning , and if I find nobody on the road to give me a lift , I shall walk the nine mile back to - night . That ’s pretty well , sir , at my age ! ’
33376	33377	33370	33370	her	906	‘ ’
33379	33390	33370	33370	her	906	’ tis . Do n’t do’t too often , missus . ’
33391	33400	33401	33401	she	906	‘ No , no . Once a year , ’
33408	33434	33401	33401	she	906	‘ I spend my savings so , once every year . I come regular , to tramp about the streets , and see the gentlemen . ’
33435	33439	33370	33370	her	906	‘ Only to see ’em
33441	33445	33405	33405	her	906	’ returned Stephen . ‘
33452	33464	33465	33465	I	0	’ she replied , with great earnestness and interest of manner . ‘
33488	33499	33485	33486	that gentleman	547	’ turning her head back towards Mr. Bounderby ’s again , ‘
33564	33701	33558	33558	I	0	’ Saying this , she looked at Stephen as if to fix his features in her mind , and her eye was not so bright as it had been . With a large allowance for difference of tastes , and with all submission to the patricians of Coketown , this seemed so extraordinary a source of interest to take so much trouble about , that it perplexed him . But they were passing the church now , and as his eye caught the clock , he quickened his pace . He was going to his work ? the old woman said , quickening hers , too , quite easily . Yes , time was nearly out . On his telling her where he worked , the old woman became a more singular old woman than before . ‘
33706	33711	33558	33558	I	0	’ she asked him . ‘
33725	33803	33723	33723	missus	901	’ He answered evasively , because the old woman appeared to take it for granted that he would be very happy indeed , and he had not the heart to disappoint her . He knew that there was trouble enough in the world ; and if the old woman had lived so long , and could count upon his having so little , why so much the better for her , and none the worse for him . ‘
33818	33822	33810	33810	your	909	’ she said . ‘
33830	33836	33810	33810	your	909	’ he answered , slightly . ‘
33854	34012	33845	33845	they	910	’ No , no ; they did n’t follow him there , said Stephen . All correct there . Everything accordant there . ( He did not go so far as to say , for her pleasure , that there was a sort of Divine Right there ; but , I have heard claims almost as magnificent of late years . ) They were now in the black by - road near the place , and the Hands were crowding in . The bell was ringing , and the Serpent was a Serpent of many coils , and the Elephant was getting ready . The strange old woman was delighted with the very bell . It was the beautifullest bell she had ever heard , she said , and sounded grand ! She asked him , when he stopped good - naturedly to shake hands with her before going in , how long he had worked there ? ‘
34017	34022	34023	34023	I	0	’ he told her . ‘
34029	34033	34023	34023	I	0	’ said she , ‘
34046	35314	35315	35315	I	0	’ And she lifted it , though he would have prevented her , and put it to her lips . What harmony , besides her age and her simplicity , surrounded her , he did not know , but even in this fantastic action there was a something neither out of time nor place : a something which it seemed as if nobody else could have made as serious , or done with such a natural and touching air . He had been at his loom full half an hour , thinking about this old woman , when , having occasion to move round the loom for its adjustment , he glanced through a window which was in his corner , and saw her still looking up at the pile of building , lost in admiration . Heedless of the smoke and mud and wet , and of her two long journeys , she was gazing at it , as if the heavy thrum that issued from its many stories were proud music to her . She was gone by and by , and the day went after her , and the lights sprung up again , and the Express whirled in full sight of the Fairy Palace over the arches near : little felt amid the jarring of the machinery , and scarcely heard above its crash and rattle . Long before then his thoughts had gone back to the dreary room above the little shop , and to the shameful figure heavy on the bed , but heavier on his heart . Machinery slackened ; throbbing feebly like a fainting pulse ; stopped . The bell again ; the glare of light and heat dispelled ; the factories , looming heavy in the black wet night — their tall chimneys rising up into the air like competing Towers of Babel . He had spoken to Rachael only last night , it was true , and had walked with her a little way ; but he had his new misfortune on him , in which no one else could give him a moment ’s relief , and , for the sake of it , and because he knew himself to want that softening of his anger which no voice but hers could effect , he felt he might so far disregard what she had said as to wait for her again . He waited , but she had eluded him . She was gone . On no other night in the year could he so ill have spared her patient face . O ! Better to have no home in which to lay his head , than to have a home and dread to go to it , through such a cause . He ate and drank , for he was exhausted — but he little knew or cared what ; and he wandered about in the chill rain , thinking and thinking , and brooding and brooding . No word of a new marriage had ever passed between them ; but Rachael had taken great pity on him years ago , and to her alone he had opened his closed heart all this time , on the subject of his miseries ; and he knew very well that if he were free to ask her , she would take him . He thought of the home he might at that moment have been seeking with pleasure and pride ; of the different man he might have been that night ; of the lightness then in his now heavy - laden breast ; of the then restored honour , self - respect , and tranquillity all torn to pieces . He thought of the waste of the best part of his life , of the change it made in his character for the worse every day , of the dreadful nature of his existence , bound hand and foot , to a dead woman , and tormented by a demon in her shape . He thought of Rachael , how young when they were first brought together in these circumstances , how mature now , how soon to grow old . He thought of the number of girls and women she had seen marry , how many homes with children in them she had seen grow up around her , how she had contentedly pursued her own lone quiet path — for him — and how he had sometimes seen a shade of melancholy on her blessed face , that smote him with remorse and despair . He set the picture of her up , beside the infamous image of last night ; and thought , Could it be , that the whole earthly course of one so gentle , good , and self - denying , was subjugate to such a wretch as that ! Filled with these thoughts — so filled that he had an unwholesome sense of growing larger , of being placed in some new and diseased relation towards the objects among which he passed , of seeing the iris round every misty light turn red — he went home for shelter . A candle faintly burned in the window , to which the black ladder had often been raised for the sliding away of all that was most precious in this world to a striving wife and a brood of hungry babies ; and Stephen added to his other thoughts the stern reflection , that of all the casualties of this existence upon earth , not one was dealt out with so unequal a hand as Death . The inequality of Birth was nothing to it . For , say that the child of a King and the child of a Weaver were born to - night in the same moment , what was that disparity , to the death of any human creature who was serviceable to , or beloved by , another , while this abandoned woman lived on ! From the outside of his home he gloomily passed to the inside , with suspended breath and with a slow footstep . He went up to his door , opened it , and so into the room . Quiet and peace were there . Rachael was there , sitting by the bed . She turned her head , and the light of her face shone in upon the midnight of his mind . She sat by the bed , watching and tending his wife . That is to say , he saw that some one lay there , and he knew too well it must be she ; but Rachael ’s hands had put a curtain up , so that she was screened from his eyes . Her disgraceful garments were removed , and some of Rachael ’s were in the room . Everything was in its place and order as he had always kept it , the little fire was newly trimmed , and the hearth was freshly swept . It appeared to him that he saw all this in Rachael ’s face , and looked at nothing besides . While looking at it , it was shut out from his view by the softened tears that filled his eyes ; but not before he had seen how earnestly she looked at him , and how her own eyes were filled too . She turned again towards the bed , and satisfying herself that all was quiet there , spoke in a low , calm , cheerful voice . ‘
35331	35332	35326	35326	You	916	’ ‘
35335	35340	35326	35326	You	916	’ been walking up an ’

35413	35451	35453	35453	she	917	‘ I have been here once before , to - day , Stephen . Landlady came round for me at dinner - time . There was some one here that needed looking to , she said . And ‘
35470	35487	35488	35488	I	0	’ He slowly moved to a chair and sat down , drooping his head before her . ‘
35528	35543	35516	35516	you	144	’ He laid his furrowed forehead on his hand , with a low groan . ‘
35561	35633	35549	35549	I	0	’ tis far too merciful to let her die , or even so much as suffer , for want of aid . Thou knowest who said , “ Let him who is without sin among you cast the first stone at her ! ” There have been plenty to do that . Thou art not the man to cast the last stone , Stephen , when she is brought so low . ’
35634	35640	35707	35707	She	921	‘ O Rachael , Rachael ! ’
35641	35653	35654	35654	she	921	‘ Thou hast been a cruel sufferer , Heaven reward thee ! ’
35661	35675	35654	35654	she	921	‘ I am thy poor friend , with all my heart and mind . ’
35809	35817	35819	35819	Rachael	146	‘ I will stay here , Stephen , ’
35826	35833	35819	35819	Rachael	146	‘ till the bells go Three . ’
35851	35852	35819	35819	Rachael	146	’ ‘

35887	35940	35941	35941	He	144	’ Tis thou who art in need of rest — so white and tired . Try to sleep in the chair there , while I watch . Thou hadst no sleep last night , I can well believe . To - morrow ’s work is far harder for thee than for me . ’
35993	36024	35977	35977	she	921	‘ She do n’t know me , Stephen ; she just drowsily mutters and stares . I have spoken to her times and again , but she do n’t notice ! ’
36054	36055	36049	36049	she	921	’ ‘
36062	36073	36059	36059	Rachael	146	’ t looked for , that she ’ll be so ? ’
36074	36088	36089	36089	His	144	‘ Doctor said she would haply come to her mind to - morrow . ’
36121	36124	36125	36125	he	144	‘ No , ’
36128	36140	36125	36125	he	144	‘ it was not that . He had had a fright . ’
36141	36145	36112	36112	She	921	‘ A fright ? ’
36146	36167	36125	36125	he	144	‘ Ay , ay ! coming in . When I were walking . When I were thinking . When I — ’
36204	36207	36186	36186	he	144	‘ Stephen ! ’

36286	36389	36395	36395	Stephen	144	’ He had a violent fit of trembling , and then sunk into his chair . After a time he controlled himself , and , resting with an elbow on one knee , and his head upon that hand , could look towards Rachael . Seen across the dim candle with his moistened eyes , she looked as if she had a glory shining round her head . He could have believed she had . He did believe it , as the noise without shook the window , rattled at the door below , and went about the house clamouring and lamenting . ‘
36397	36438	36395	36395	Stephen	144	’ tis to be hoped she ’ll leave thee to thyself again , and do thee no more hurt . Anyways we will hope so now . And now I shall keep silence , for I want thee to sleep . ’
37654	37660	37647	37647	Stephen	144	‘ Rachael , am I wakin ’

37697	37771	37692	37692	I	0	’ The wind brought the sounds of the church clock to the window . They listened , and it struck three . Stephen looked at her , saw how pale she was , noted the disorder of her hair , and the red marks of fingers on her forehead , and felt assured that his senses of sight and hearing had been awake . She held the cup in her hand even now . ‘
37780	37800	37772	37772	I	0	’ she said , calmly pouring from the cup into the basin , and steeping the linen as before . ‘
37807	37840	37904	37904	Thou’lt	955	’ Tis done now , when I have put this on . There ! And now she ’s quiet again . The few drops in the basin I ’ll pour away , for ’
37855	37903	37904	37904	Thou’lt	955	’ As she spoke , she drained the basin into the ashes of the fire , and broke the bottle on the hearth . She had nothing to do , then , but to cover herself with her shawl before going out into the wind and rain . ‘
37909	37917	37904	37904	Thou’lt	955	’ thee at this hour , Rachael ? ’
37918	37923	37904	37904	Thou’lt	955	‘ No , Stephen . ’

38072	38103	38068	38068	she	957	’ She raised her eyes for a moment as she said the words ; and then they fell again , in all their gentleness and mildness , on his face . ‘

38160	38198	38199	38199	I	0	’ She looked at him , on his knee at her feet , with her shawl still in his hand , and the reproof on her lips died away when she saw the working of his face . ‘
38214	38223	38204	38204	I	0	’ thinking that when I said a word o ’

38692	38698	38689	38690	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ almost a young woman . ’
38738	38743	38745	38746	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Thomas is becoming , ’
38748	38754	38745	38746	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ almost a young man . ’
38788	38791	38793	38794	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Really , ’
38796	38809	38793	38794	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ the period has arrived when Thomas ought to go to Bounderby . ’
38892	38898	38900	38901	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I fear , Jupe , ’
38903	38916	38900	38901	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ that your continuance at the school any longer would be useless . ’
38917	38926	38927	38927	Sissy	76	‘ I am afraid it would , sir , ’
38933	38943	38945	38946	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I can not disguise from you , Jupe , ’
38952	39018	38945	38946	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ that the result of your probation there has disappointed me ; has greatly disappointed me . You have not acquired , under Mr. and Mrs. M’Choakumchild , anything like that amount of exact knowledge which I looked for . You are extremely deficient in your facts . Your acquaintance with figures is very limited . You are altogether backward , and below the mark . ’
39019	39026	38900	38901	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I am sorry , sir , ’
39030	39047	38900	38901	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ but I know it is quite true . Yet I have tried hard , sir . ’
39048	39051	39053	39054	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Yes , ’
39056	39081	39053	39054	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ yes , I believe you have tried hard ; I have observed you , and I can find no fault in that respect . ’
39082	39093	38900	38901	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Thank you , sir . I have thought sometimes ; ’
39099	39128	38900	38901	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ that perhaps I tried to learn too much , and that if I had asked to be allowed to try a little less , I might have — ’
39129	39136	39138	39139	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ No , Jupe , no , ’
39153	39223	39142	39142	his	71	‘ No . The course you pursued , you pursued according to the system — the system — and there is no more to be said about it . I can only suppose that the circumstances of your early life were too unfavourable to the development of your reasoning powers , and that we began too late . Still , as I have said already , I am disappointed . ’
39224	39259	38900	38901	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I wish I could have made a better acknowledgment , sir , of your kindness to a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon you , and of your protection of her . ’
39260	39266	39268	39269	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Do n’t shed tears , ’
39271	39304	39268	39269	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Do n’t shed tears . I do n’t complain of you . You are an affectionate , earnest , good young woman — and — and we must make that do . ’
39305	39314	39316	39316	Sissy	76	‘ Thank you , sir , very much , ’
39323	39368	39370	39371	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ You are useful to Mrs. Gradgrind , and ( in a generally pervading way ) you are serviceable in the family also ; so I understand from Miss Louisa , and , indeed , so I have observed myself . I therefore hope , ’
39373	39384	39370	39371	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ that you can make yourself happy in those relations . ’
39385	39397	39405	39406	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I should have nothing to wish , sir , if — ’
39398	39403	39405	39406	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I understand you , ’
39408	39462	39405	39406	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ you still refer to your father . I have heard from Miss Louisa that you still preserve that bottle . Well ! If your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been more successful , you would have been wiser on these points . I will say no more . ’
39822	39828	39830	39831	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Quite a young woman , ’
39835	39839	39830	39831	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Dear me ! ’

39963	39968	39960	39960	her	92	‘ Yes , father . ’
39969	39973	39975	39976	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ My dear , ’
39978	40003	39975	39976	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I must speak with you alone and seriously . Come to me in my room after breakfast to - morrow , will you ? ’
40004	40009	39960	39960	her	92	‘ Yes , father . ’
40010	40024	39960	39960	her	92	‘ Your hands are rather cold , Louisa . Are you not well ? ’
40025	40031	39975	39976	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Quite well , father . ’
40032	40036	40037	40037	She	92	‘ And cheerful ? ’
40050	40068	40046	40046	her	92	‘ I am as cheerful , father , as I usually am , or usually have been . ’
40069	40074	40076	40077	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ That ’s well , ’
40125	40132	40143	40143	He	2932	‘ Are you there , Loo ? ’
40160	40164	40165	40165	she	92	‘ Dear Tom , ’
40173	40186	40165	40165	she	92	‘ how long it is since you have been to see me ! ’
40187	40255	40134	40135	her brother	2932	‘ Why , I have been otherwise engaged , Loo , in the evenings ; and in the daytime old Bounderby has been keeping me at it rather . But I touch him up with you when he comes it too strong , and so we preserve an understanding . I say ! Has father said anything particular to you to - day or yesterday , Loo ? ’
40256	40278	40165	40165	she	92	‘ No , Tom . But he told me to - night that he wished to do so in the morning . ’
40279	40288	40290	40290	Tom	71	‘ Ah ! That ’s what I mean , ’
40292	40303	40290	40290	Tom	71	‘ Do you know where he is to - night ? ’
40311	40314	40290	40290	Tom	71	‘ No . ’
40315	40372	40374	40374	her	1006	‘ Then I ’ll tell you . He ’s with old Bounderby . They are having a regular confab together up at the Bank . Why at the Bank , do you think ? Well , I ’ll tell you again . To keep Mrs. Sparsit ’s ears as far off as possible , I expect . ’
40417	40430	40415	40415	him	2932	‘ You are very fond of me , an’t you , Loo ? ’
40431	40453	40408	40408	his	2932	‘ Indeed I am , Tom , though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me . ’
40454	40461	40463	40463	Tom	71	‘ Well , sister of mine , ’
40465	40537	40463	40463	Tom	71	‘ when you say that , you are near my thoughts . We might be so much oftener together — might n’t we ? Always together , almost — might n’t we ? It would do me a great deal of good if you were to make up your mind to I know what , Loo . It would be a splendid thing for me . It would be uncommonly jolly ! ’
40577	40622	40565	40565	She	1009	‘ I say , Loo ! I thought I ’d come , and just hint to you what was going on : though I supposed you ’d most likely guess , even if you did n’t know . I ca n’t stay , because I ’m
40642	40643	40637	40637	you	71	’ ‘
40654	40655	40649	40649	I	0	’ ‘
40662	40666	40649	40649	I	0	’ said Tom . ‘
40673	41076	40671	40671	Loo	101	’ She gave him an affectionate good - night , and went out with him to the door , whence the fires of Coketown could be seen , making the distance lurid . She stood there , looking steadfastly towards them , and listening to his departing steps . They retreated quickly , as glad to get away from Stone Lodge ; and she stood there yet , when he was gone and all was quiet . It seemed as if , first in her own fire within the house , and then in the fiery haze without , she tried to discover what kind of woof Old Time , that greatest and longest - established Spinner of all , would weave from the threads he had already spun into a woman . But his factory is a secret place , his work is noiseless , and his Hands are mutes . Although Mr. Gradgrind did not take after Blue Beard , his room was quite a blue chamber in its abundance of blue books . Whatever they could prove ( which is usually anything you like ) , they proved there , in an army constantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits . In that charmed apartment , the most complicated social questions were cast up , got into exact totals , and finally settled — if those concerned could only have been brought to know it . As if an astronomical observatory should be made without any windows , and the astronomer within should arrange the starry universe solely by pen , ink , and paper , so Mr. Gradgrind , in his Observatory ( and there are many like it ) , had no need to cast an eye upon the teeming myriads of human beings around him , but could settle all their destinies on a slate , and wipe out all their tears with one dirty little bit of sponge . To this Observatory , then : a stern room , with a deadly statistical clock in it , which measured every second with a beat like a rap upon a coffin - lid ; Louisa repaired on the appointed morning . A window looked towards Coketown ; and when she sat down near her father ’s table , she saw the high chimneys and the long tracts of smoke looming in the heavy distance gloomily . ‘
41081	41086	40671	40671	Loo	101	’ said her father , ‘
41191	41214	41215	41215	Louisa	92	’ He waited , as if he would have been glad that she said something . But she said never a word . ‘
41236	41263	41215	41215	Louisa	92	’ Again he waited , and again she answered not one word . This so far surprised him , as to induce him gently to repeat , ‘
41272	41284	41215	41215	Louisa	92	’ To which she returned , without any visible emotion whatever : ‘
41299	41300	41295	41295	I	0	’ ‘
41303	41322	41323	41323	you	92	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , breaking into a smile , after being for the moment at a loss , ‘
41353	41354	41355	41355	I	0	’ ‘
41393	41453	41385	41385	you	0	’ Strange to relate , Mr. Gradgrind was not so collected at this moment as his daughter was . He took a paper - knife in his hand , turned it over , laid it down , took it up again , and even then had to look along the blade of it , considering how to go on . ‘
41578	41598	41566	41566	his	93	’ Silence between them . The deadly statistical clock very hollow . The distant smoke very black and heavy . ‘
41601	41605	41607	41607	you	108	’ said Louisa , ‘
41614	41625	41607	41607	you	108	’ Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question . ‘
41631	41635	41636	41636	I	0	’ he returned , ‘
41648	41649	41636	41636	I	0	’ ‘
41652	41663	41665	41665	you	108	’ pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before , ‘
41673	41674	41665	41665	you	108	’ ‘
41687	41688	41683	41683	I	0	’ ‘
41691	41696	41689	41689	Father	2781	’ she still pursued , ‘
41706	41707	41698	41699	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ ‘
41713	41718	41698	41699	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , ‘
41727	41728	41724	41724	your	601	’ ‘
41740	41748	41738	41738	father	2781	‘ Certainly , my dear . Because ; ’
41762	41888	41738	41738	father	2781	‘ because the reply depends so materially , Louisa , on the sense in which we use the expression . Now , Mr. Bounderby does not do you the injustice , and does not do himself the injustice , of pretending to anything fanciful , fantastic , or ( I am using synonymous terms ) sentimental . Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes , to very little purpose , if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense , not to say to his , as to address you from any such ground . Therefore , perhaps the expression itself — I merely suggest this to you , my dear — may be a little misplaced . ’
41889	41903	41724	41724	your	601	‘ What would you advise me to use in its stead , father ? ’
41904	41911	41913	41914	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Why , my dear Louisa , ’
41922	42242	41913	41914	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I would advise you ( since you ask me ) to consider this question , as you have been accustomed to consider every other question , simply as one of tangible Fact . The ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies , and other absurdities that have no existence , properly viewed — really no existence — but it is no compliment to you to say , that you know better . Now , what are the Facts of this case ? You are , we will say in round numbers , twenty years of age ; Mr. Bounderby is , we will say in round numbers , fifty . There is some disparity in your respective years , but in your means and positions there is none ; on the contrary , there is a great suitability . Then the question arises , Is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage ? In considering this question , it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage , so far as they have yet been obtained , in England and Wales . I find , on reference to the figures , that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages , and that the elder of these contracting parties is , in rather more than three - fourths of these instances , the bridegroom . It is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law , that among the natives of the British possessions in India , also in a considerable part of China , and among the Calmucks of Tartary , the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers , yield similar results . The disparity I have mentioned , therefore , almost ceases to be disparity , and ( virtually ) all but disappears . ’
42243	42251	42253	42253	Louisa	92	‘ What do you recommend , father , ’
42268	42286	42253	42253	Louisa	92	‘ that I should substitute for the term I used just now ? For the misplaced expression ? ’
42287	42290	42292	42293	her father	2855	‘ Louisa , ’
42295	42357	42292	42293	her father	2855	‘ it appears to me that nothing can be plainer . Confining yourself rigidly to Fact , the question of Fact you state to yourself is : Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him ? Yes , he does . The sole remaining question then is : Shall I marry him ? I think nothing can be plainer than that ? ’
42358	42364	42366	42366	Louisa	92	‘ Shall I marry him ? ’
42372	42422	42366	42366	Louisa	92	‘ Precisely . And it is satisfactory to me , as your father , my dear Louisa , to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind , and habits of life , that belong to many young women . ’
42423	42428	42429	42429	she	92	‘ No , father , ’
42432	42437	42429	42429	she	92	‘ I do not . ’
42438	42448	42450	42451	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I now leave you to judge for yourself , ’
42453	42502	42450	42451	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I have stated the case , as such cases are usually stated among practical minds ; I have stated it , as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time . The rest , my dear Louisa , is for you to decide . ’
42706	42719	42700	42700	he	71	‘ Are you consulting the chimneys of the Coketown works , Louisa ? ’
42720	42745	42746	42746	she	92	‘ There seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke . Yet when the night comes , Fire bursts out , father ! ’
42752	42771	42746	42746	she	92	‘ Of course I know that , Louisa . I do not see the application of the remark . ’
42805	42818	42797	42797	her	92	‘ Father , I have often thought that life is very short . ’
42832	42884	42797	42797	her	92	‘ It is short , no doubt , my dear . Still , the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years . The calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices , among other figures which can not go wrong , have established the fact . ’
42885	42895	42797	42797	her	92	‘ I speak of my own life , father . ’
42896	42902	42904	42905	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ O indeed ? Still , ’
42907	42932	42904	42905	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I need not point out to you , Louisa , that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate . ’
42933	42961	42797	42797	her	92	‘ While it lasts , I would wish to do the little I can , and the little I am fit for . What does it matter ? ’
42978	42989	42962	42963	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ How , matter ? What matter , my dear ? ’
42990	42994	42995	42995	she	1029	‘ Mr. Bounderby , ’
43009	43052	42995	42995	she	1029	‘ asks me to marry him . The question I have to ask myself is , shall I marry him ? That is so , father , is it not ? You have told me so , father . Have you not ? ’
43053	43059	42797	42797	her	92	‘ Certainly , my dear . ’
43060	43122	42995	42995	she	1029	‘ Let it be so . Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus , I am satisfied to accept his proposal . Tell him , father , as soon as you please , that this was my answer . Repeat it , word for word , if you can , because I should wish him to know what I said . ’
43123	43132	43134	43135	her father	2855	‘ It is quite right , my dear , ’
43138	43167	43134	43135	her father	2855	‘ to be exact . I will observe your very proper request . Have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage , my child ? ’
43168	43178	43179	43180	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ None , father . What does it matter ! ’
43230	43277	43214	43214	He	71	‘ Louisa , I have not considered it essential to ask you one question , because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote . But perhaps I ought to do so . You have never entertained in secret any other proposal ? ’
43278	43281	43282	43282	she	1030	‘ Father , ’
43288	43316	43282	43282	she	1030	‘ what other proposal can have been made to me ? Whom have I seen ? Where have I been ? What are my heart ’s experiences ? ’
43317	43322	43324	43325	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ My dear Louisa , ’
43331	43345	43214	43214	He	71	‘ You correct me justly . I merely wished to discharge my duty . ’
43346	43354	43356	43356	Louisa	92	‘ What do I know , father , ’
43362	43409	43356	43356	Louisa	92	‘ of tastes and fancies ; of aspirations and affections ; of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished ? What escape have I had from problems that could be demonstrated , and realities that could be grasped ? ’
43441	43445	43434	43434	she	1030	‘ My dear , ’
43452	43459	43434	43434	she	1030	‘ quite true , quite true . ’
43460	43465	43466	43466	she	1030	‘ Why , father , ’
43469	43569	43466	43466	she	1030	‘ what a strange question to ask me ! The baby - preference that even I have heard of as common among children , has never had its innocent resting - place in my breast . You have been so careful of me , that I never had a child ’s heart . You have trained me so well , that I never dreamed a child ’s dream . You have dealt so wisely with me , father , from my cradle to this hour , that I never had a child ’s belief or a child ’s fear . ’
43586	43591	43593	43593	he	71	‘ My dear Louisa , ’
43595	43609	43593	43593	he	71	‘ you abundantly repay my care . Kiss me , my dear girl . ’
43626	43740	43623	43623	he	71	‘ I may assure you now , my favourite child , that I am made happy by the sound decision at which you have arrived . Mr. Bounderby is a very remarkable man ; and what little disparity can be said to exist between you — if any — is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired . It has always been my object so to educate you , as that you might , while still in your early youth , be ( if I may so express myself ) almost any age . Kiss me once more , Louisa . Now , let us go and find your mother . ’

44014	44021	44024	44024	you	95	’ said her husband , solemnly , ‘

44160	44194	44158	44158	him	1040	’ Nobody present having any suggestion to offer in the remarkable emergency , Mrs. Gradgrind departed this life for the time being , after delivering the following codicil to her remarks already executed : ‘
44256	44513	44248	44248	I	0	’ When Mr. Gradgrind had presented Mrs. Bounderby , Sissy had suddenly turned her head , and looked , in wonder , in pity , in sorrow , in doubt , in a multitude of emotions , towards Louisa . Louisa had known it , and seen it , without looking at her . From that moment she was impassive , proud and cold — held Sissy at a distance — changed to her altogether . Mr. Bounderby ’s first disquietude on hearing of his happiness , was occasioned by the necessity of imparting it to Mrs. Sparsit . He could not make up his mind how to do that , or what the consequences of the step might be . Whether she would instantly depart , bag and baggage , to Lady Scadgers , or would positively refuse to budge from the premises ; whether she would be plaintive or abusive , tearful or tearing ; whether she would break her heart , or break the looking - glass ; Mr. Bounderby could not all foresee . However , as it must be done , he had no choice but to do it ; so , after attempting several letters , and failing in them all , he resolved to do it by word of mouth . On his way home , on the evening he set aside for this momentous purpose , he took the precaution of stepping into a chemist ’s shop and buying a bottle of the very strongest smelling - salts . ‘
44517	44522	44515	44515	George	72	’ said Mr. Bounderby , ‘
44545	44589	44532	44532	I	0	’ But , in spite of being thus forearmed , he entered his own house with anything but a courageous air ; and appeared before the object of his misgivings , like a dog who was conscious of coming direct from the pantry . ‘
44596	44597	44593	44594	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ ‘
44606	44625	44626	44626	Your	93	’ He drew up his chair , and Mrs. Sparsit drew back hers , as who should say , ‘
44650	44651	44646	44646	you	2771	’ ‘
44662	44667	44660	44660	ma’am	361	’ said Mr. Bounderby . ‘
44673	44794	44671	44671	sir	2771	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , and returned , though short of her former position . Mr. Bounderby sat looking at her , as , with the points of a stiff , sharp pair of scissors , she picked out holes for some inscrutable ornamental purpose , in a piece of cambric . An operation which , taken in connexion with the bushy eyebrows and the Roman nose , suggested with some liveliness the idea of a hawk engaged upon the eyes of a tough little bird . She was so steadfastly occupied , that many minutes elapsed before she looked up from her work ; when she did so Mr. Bounderby bespoke her attention with a hitch of his head . ‘
44800	44831	44795	44796	Mrs. Sparsit	126	’ said Mr. Bounderby , putting his hands in his pockets , and assuring himself with his right hand that the cork of the little bottle was ready for use , ‘
44858	44859	44860	44860	Sir	2771	’ ‘
44862	44867	44860	44860	Sir	2771	’ returned the lady , ‘
44888	44889	44876	44876	you	2771	’ ‘
44895	44900	44890	44891	Mrs. Sparsit	126	’ said Mr. Bounderby , ‘
44908	44909	44912	44912	sir	2771	’ ‘
44914	44947	44912	44912	sir	2771	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , interrogatively , and in the most tranquil manner possible . She generally wore mittens , and she now laid down her work , and smoothed those mittens . ‘
44954	44958	44948	44948	I	0	’ said Bounderby , ‘
44966	44967	44952	44952	ma’am	361	’ ‘
44972	44977	44970	44970	sir	2771	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
45000	45058	44991	44991	I	0	’ And she said it with such great condescension as well as with such great compassion for him , that Bounderby , — far more disconcerted than if she had thrown her workbox at the mirror , or swooned on the hearthrug , — corked up the smelling - salts tight in his pocket , and thought , ‘
45078	45079	45070	45070	she	3371	’ ‘
45089	45119	45087	45087	sir	2771	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , in a highly superior manner ; somehow she seemed , in a moment , to have established a right to pity him ever afterwards ; ‘
45130	45131	45087	45087	sir	2771	’ ‘
45136	45158	45087	45087	sir	2771	’ returned Bounderby , with some resentment in his tone : which was clearly lowered , though in spite of himself , ‘
45171	45172	45174	45174	you	2771	’ ‘
45178	45187	45174	45174	you	2771	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , with great affability . ‘
45198	45235	45195	45195	you	2771	’ A very awkward pause on Mr. Bounderby ’s part , succeeded . Mrs. Sparsit sedately resumed her work and occasionally gave a small cough , which sounded like the cough of conscious strength and forbearance . ‘
45240	45244	45195	45195	you	2771	’ resumed Bounderby , ‘
45273	45274	45336	45336	ma’am	361	’ ‘
45291	45333	45336	45336	ma’am	361	’ Mrs. Sparsit shook her head , still in her highly superior manner , and a little changed the small cough — coughing now , as if the spirit of prophecy rose within her , but had better be coughed down . ‘
45338	45342	45336	45336	ma’am	361	’ said Bounderby , ‘
45377	45378	45379	45379	I	0	’ ‘
45404	45405	45394	45394	you	2771	’ ‘
45436	45437	45438	45438	Sir	2771	’ ‘
45440	45445	45438	45438	Sir	2771	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
45476	45477	45465	45465	I	0	’ ‘
45485	45489	45465	45465	I	0	’ said Bounderby . ‘

45608	45612	45613	45613	Sir	2771	’ said Bounderby . ‘
45615	45620	45613	45613	Sir	2771	’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
45647	45669	45671	45671	I	0	’ she might have said the sweetbread , for that delicate article in a savoury brown sauce was her favourite supper : ‘
45710	45722	45705	45705	I	0	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , concluding in an impressively compassionate manner , ‘
45738	45863	45705	45705	I	0	’ Nothing moved Mrs. Sparsit from that position any more . It was in vain for Bounderby to bluster or to assert himself in any of his explosive ways ; Mrs. Sparsit was resolved to have compassion on him , as a Victim . She was polite , obliging , cheerful , hopeful ; but , the more polite , the more obliging , the more cheerful , the more hopeful , the more exemplary altogether , she ; the forlorner Sacrifice and Victim , he . She had that tenderness for his melancholy fate , that his great red countenance used to break out into cold perspirations when she looked at him . Meanwhile the marriage was appointed to be solemnized in eight weeks ’
46202	46605	46193	46194	the bridegroom	3562	‘ Ladies and gentlemen , I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown . Since you have done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness , I suppose I must acknowledge the same ; though , as you all know me , and know what I am , and what my extraction was , you wo n’t expect a speech from a man who , when he sees a Post , says “ that ’s a Post , ” and when he sees a Pump , says “ that ’s a Pump , ” and is not to be got to call a Post a Pump , or a Pump a Post , or either of them a Toothpick . If you want a speech this morning , my friend and father - in - law , Tom Gradgrind , is a Member of Parliament , and you know where to get it . I am not your man . However , if I feel a little independent when I look around this table to - day , and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind ’s daughter when I was a ragged street - boy , who never washed his face unless it was at a pump , and that not oftener than once a fortnight , I hope I may be excused . So , I hope you like my feeling independent ; if you do n’t , I ca n’t help it . I do feel independent . Now I have mentioned , and you have mentioned , that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind ’s daughter . I am very glad to be so . It has long been my wish to be so . I have watched her bringing - up , and I believe she is worthy of me . At the same time — not to deceive you — I believe I am worthy of her . So , I thank you , on both our parts , for the good - will you have shown towards us ; and the best wish I can give the unmarried part of the present company , is this : I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I have found . And I hope every spinster may find as good a husband as my wife has found . ’
46699	46718	46720	46720	Tom	157	‘ What a game girl you are , to be such a first - rate sister , Loo ! ’
46753	46760	46762	46762	Tom	157	‘ Old Bounderby ’s quite ready , ’
46764	46802	46762	46762	Tom	157	‘ Time ’s up . Good - bye ! I shall be on the look - out for you , when you come back . I say , my dear Loo ! An’t it uncommonly jolly now ! ’
47186	47195	47184	47184	he	1122	‘ sooner pitch his property into the Atlantic . ’
48488	48494	48496	48497	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Thank you , Bitzer , ’
48499	48505	48507	48509	the light porter	1169	‘ Thank you , ma’am , ’
48537	48545	48547	48548	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ All is shut up , Bitzer ? ’

48573	48583	48565	48566	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ is the news of the day ? Anything ? ’
48584	48617	48547	48548	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Well , ma’am , I ca n’t say that I have heard anything particular . Our people are a bad lot , ma’am ; but that is no news , unfortunately . ’
48618	48627	48629	48630	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ What are the restless wretches doing now ? ’
48632	48656	48629	48630	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Merely going on in the old way , ma’am . Uniting , and leaguing , and engaging to stand by one another . ’
48657	48665	48667	48668	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ It is much to be regretted , ’
48687	48700	48684	48684	her	126	‘ that the united masters allow of any such class - combinations . ’
48701	48706	48708	48708	Bitzer	77	‘ Yes , ma’am , ’
48710	48736	48738	48739	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Being united themselves , they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any man who is united with any other man , ’
48741	48749	48751	48751	Bitzer	77	‘ They have done that , ma’am , ’
48753	48762	48751	48751	Bitzer	77	‘ but it rather fell through , ma’am . ’
48763	48773	48775	48776	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ I do not pretend to understand these things , ’
48781	48838	48775	48776	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere ; and Mr. Sparsit , as a Powler , being also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions . I only know that these people must be conquered , and that it ’s high time it was done , once for all . ’
48839	48844	48846	48846	Bitzer	77	‘ Yes , ma’am , ’

48961	48976	48977	48977	He	77	‘ Not a very busy day , my lady . About an average day . ’
49005	49009	49011	49012	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ The clerks , ’
49030	49042	49024	49024	her	126	‘ are trustworthy , punctual , and industrious , of course ? ’
49043	49058	49059	49059	He	77	‘ Yes , ma’am , pretty fair , ma’am . With the usual exception . ’

49588	49605	49578	49578	I	0	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , with a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality , ‘
49640	49652	49664	49665	an individual	1205	’ Bitzer knuckled his forehead again , and again begged pardon . ‘

50868	51040	50860	50861	the gentleman	281	’ said Bitzer , with his light eye at Mrs. Sparsit ’s keyhole . So , Mrs. Sparsit , who had improved the interval by touching up her cap , took her classical features down - stairs again , and entered the board - room in the manner of a Roman matron going outside the city walls to treat with an invading general . The visitor having strolled to the window , and being then engaged in looking carelessly out , was as unmoved by this impressive entry as man could possibly be . He stood whistling to himself with all imaginable coolness , with his hat still on , and a certain air of exhaustion upon him , in part arising from excessive summer , and in part from excessive gentility . For it was to be seen with half an eye that he was a thorough gentleman , made to the model of the time ; weary of everything , and putting no more faith in anything than Lucifer . ‘
51046	51051	51052	51052	you	2771	’ quoth Mrs. Sparsit , ‘

51396	51406	51388	51388	You	2771	’ was the inference he drew from the communication . ‘

51455	51479	51409	51412	the servant of circumstances	1287	’ It seemed to be scarcely worth his while to finish the sentence , so he played with his watch - chain wearily . ‘

51509	51514	51409	51412	the servant of circumstances	1287	’ said the stranger . ‘
51593	51600	51626	51626	he	93	’ Mrs. Sparsit inclined her head . ‘
51661	51662	51673	51673	he	93	’ ‘
51667	51672	51673	51673	he	93	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
51677	51678	51673	51673	he	93	’ ‘
51719	51732	51733	51741	a lady of a very superior and agreeable appearance	1303	’ towards which he languidly waved his hand , then slightly bowed , ‘
51780	51853	51768	51768	I	0	’ The inattention and indolence of his manner were sufficiently relieved , to Mrs. Sparsit ’s thinking , by a certain gallantry at ease , which offered her homage too . Here he was , for instance , at this moment , all but sitting on the table , and yet lazily bending over her , as if he acknowledged an attraction in her that made her charming — in her way . ‘
51868	51917	51854	51854	Banks	164	’ said the stranger , whose lightness and smoothness of speech were pleasant likewise ; suggesting matter far more sensible and humorous than it ever contained — which was perhaps a shrewd device of the founder of this numerous sect , whosoever may have been that great man : ‘
51951	51982	51938	51938	Gradgrind	71	’ Mrs. Sparsit recognized the hand , intimated that such confirmation was quite unnecessary , and gave Mr. Bounderby ’s address , with all needful clues and directions in aid . ‘
51986	51991	51938	51938	Gradgrind	71	’ said the stranger . ‘
52000	52001	51994	51994	you	0	’ ‘

52044	52054	52055	52055	he	1291	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , suddenly compressing her mouth , ‘
52061	52062	52055	52055	he	1291	’ ‘
52074	52075	52067	52068	a philosopher	1312	’ ‘
52080	52085	52087	52087	she	3277	’ said Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
52089	52090	52087	52087	she	3277	’ ‘
52096	52113	52087	52087	she	3277	’ pursued the stranger , fluttering over Mrs. Sparsit ’s eyebrows , with a propitiatory air , ‘
52213	52219	52220	52221	A chit	1319	’ Mrs. Sparsit laughed outright . ‘
52223	52227	52220	52221	A chit	1319	’ said she . ‘

52246	52257	52237	52237	I	0	’ returned the stranger , detaching himself from the table , ‘
52268	52314	52315	52315	I	0	’ It really did seem to impress him , to the utmost extent of his capacity of being impressed . He looked at his informant for full a quarter of a minute , and appeared to have the surprise in his mind all the time . ‘
52322	52330	52315	52315	I	0	’ he then said , much exhausted , ‘
52373	52409	52412	52412	you	1321	’ He bowed himself out ; and Mrs. Sparsit , hiding in the window curtain , saw him languishing down the street on the shady side of the way , observed of all the town . ‘
52420	52434	52418	52418	Bitzer	77	’ she asked the light porter , when he came to take away . ‘
52446	52447	52444	52444	ma’am	361	’ ‘
52453	52458	52444	52444	ma’am	361	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
52465	52466	52469	52469	ma’am	361	’ ‘
52471	52475	52469	52469	ma’am	361	’ returned Bitzer , ‘
52483	52484	52469	52469	ma’am	361	’ ‘
52490	52501	52502	52502	he	281	’ resumed Bitzer , while he was polishing the table , ‘
52511	52512	52508	52508	he	281	’ ‘
52519	52524	52508	52508	he	281	’ said Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
52531	52535	52529	52529	ma’am	361	’ said Bitzer , ‘
52544	52777	52541	52542	the players	1327	’ Whether it was that the heat prevented Mrs. Sparsit from working , or whether it was that her hand was out , she did no work that night . She sat at the window , when the sun began to sink behind the smoke ; she sat there , when the smoke was burning red , when the colour faded from it , when darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground , and creep upward , upward , up to the house - tops , up the church steeple , up to the summits of the factory chimneys , up to the sky . Without a candle in the room , Mrs. Sparsit sat at the window , with her hands before her , not thinking much of the sounds of evening ; the whooping of boys , the barking of dogs , the rumbling of wheels , the steps and voices of passengers , the shrill street cries , the clogs upon the pavement when it was their hour for going by , the shutting - up of shop - shutters . Not until the light porter announced that her nocturnal sweetbread was ready , did Mrs. Sparsit arouse herself from her reverie , and convey her dense black eyebrows — by that time creased with meditation , as if they needed ironing out - up - stairs . ‘
52783	53247	53248	53248	Jem	167	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , when she was alone at her supper . Whom she meant , she did not say ; but she could scarcely have meant the sweetbread . The Gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the Graces . They went about recruiting ; and where could they enlist recruits more hopefully , than among the fine gentlemen who , having found out everything to be worth nothing , were equally ready for anything ? Moreover , the healthy spirits who had mounted to this sublime height were attractive to many of the Gradgrind school . They liked fine gentlemen ; they pretended that they did not , but they did . They became exhausted in imitation of them ; and they yaw - yawed in their speech like them ; and they served out , with an enervated air , the little mouldy rations of political economy , on which they regaled their disciples . There never before was seen on earth such a wonderful hybrid race as was thus produced . Among the fine gentlemen not regularly belonging to the Gradgrind school , there was one of a good family and a better appearance , with a happy turn of humour which had told immensely with the House of Commons on the occasion of his entertaining it with his ( and the Board of Directors ) view of a railway accident , in which the most careful officers ever known , employed by the most liberal managers ever heard of , assisted by the finest mechanical contrivances ever devised , the whole in action on the best line ever constructed , had killed five people and wounded thirty - two , by a casualty without which the excellence of the whole system would have been positively incomplete . Among the slain was a cow , and among the scattered articles unowned , a widow ’s cap . And the honourable member had so tickled the House ( which has a delicate sense of humour ) by putting the cap on the cow , that it became impatient of any serious reference to the Coroner ’s Inquest , and brought the railway off with Cheers and Laughter . Now , this gentleman had a younger brother of still better appearance than himself , who had tried life as a Cornet of Dragoons , and found it a bore ; and had afterwards tried it in the train of an English minister abroad , and found it a bore ; and had then strolled to Jerusalem , and got bored there ; and had then gone yachting about the world , and got bored everywhere . To whom this honourable and jocular , member fraternally said one day , ‘
53276	53300	53268	53268	you	167	’ Jem , rather taken by the novelty of the idea , and very hard up for a change , was as ready to ‘
53303	53344	53268	53268	you	167	’ for statistics as for anything else . So , he went in . He coached himself up with a blue - book or two ; and his brother put it about among the hard Fact fellows , and said , ‘
53380	53446	53447	53448	Josiah Bounderby	97	’ After a few dashes in the public meeting way , Mr. Gradgrind and a council of political sages approved of Jem , and it was resolved to send him down to Coketown , to become known there and in the neighbourhood . Hence the letter Jem had last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit , which Mr. Bounderby now held in his hand ; superscribed , ‘
53467	53524	53464	53465	Thomas Gradgrind	71	’ Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse ’s card , Mr. Bounderby put on his hat and went down to the Hotel . There he found Mr. James Harthouse looking out of window , in a state of mind so disconsolate , that he was already half - disposed to ‘
53527	53532	53533	53533	My	0	’ for something else . ‘
53538	53543	53536	53536	sir	2771	’ said his visitor , ‘
53551	53575	53545	53546	Josiah Bounderby	97	’ Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed ( though he scarcely looked so ) to have a pleasure he had long expected . ‘
53580	53589	53545	53546	Josiah Bounderby	97	’ said Bounderby , obstinately taking a chair , ‘
53637	53644	53624	53624	I	0	’ Mr. Harthouse would be charmed . ‘
53653	53657	53624	53624	I	0	’ said Bounderby . ‘

53753	53756	53762	53763	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ going in ’
53766	53787	53762	53763	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ Mr. Bounderby , I assure you I am entirely and completely of your way of thinking . On conviction . ’
53788	53796	53798	53798	Bounderby	93	‘ I am glad to hear it , ’
53800	53888	53798	53798	Bounderby	93	‘ Now , you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills , no doubt . You have ? Very good . I ’ll state the fact of it to you . It ’s the pleasantest work there is , and it ’s the lightest work there is , and it ’s the best - paid work there is . More than that , we could n’t improve the mills themselves , unless we laid down Turkey carpets on the floors . Which we ’re
53896	53897	53898	53899	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ ‘

53908	53912	53898	53899	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ said Bounderby , ‘

53995	54018	53990	53990	you	93	’ Mr. Harthouse professed himself in the highest degree instructed and refreshed , by this condensed epitome of the whole Coketown question . ‘
54024	54029	53990	53990	you	93	’ replied Mr. Bounderby , ‘
54146	54174	54124	54124	I	0	’ If anything could have exalted Jem ’s interest in Mr. Bounderby , it would have been this very circumstance . Or , so he told him . ‘
54178	54182	54124	54124	I	0	’ said Bounderby , ‘
54266	54270	54274	54275	Mr. Harthouse	167	’re pretty well . ’

54309	54352	54307	54307	he	93	‘ or perhaps you do n’t know , I married Tom Gradgrind ’s daughter . If you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me , I shall be glad to introduce you to Tom Gradgrind ’s daughter . ’
54353	54357	54359	54359	Jem	167	‘ Mr. Bounderby , ’
54361	54368	54359	54359	Jem	167	‘ you anticipate my dearest wishes . ’

If he is not Tom Gradgrind ’s colleague before long , I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns . You observe , Mr. Harthouse , that my wife is my junior . I do n’t know what she saw in me to marry me , but she saw something in me , I suppose , or she would n’t have married me . She has lots of expensive knowledge , sir , political and otherwise . If you want to cram for anything , I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than Loo Bounderby . ’
54886	54889	54891	54892	his host	1374	‘ Come ! ’

55028	55043	55026	55026	I	0	’em advantages — so you ’ll not waste your power , I dare say . ’

55059	55084	55050	55050	Jem	167	‘ is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state , quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works . ’
55085	55093	55094	55094	she	92	‘ You respect Mr. Bounderby very much , ’
55098	55106	55094	55094	she	92	‘ It is natural that you should . ’
55128	55138	55114	55123	a gentleman who had seen so much of the world	1376	‘ Now , how am I to take this ? ’
55139	55171	55173	55173	Louisa	92	‘ You are going to devote yourself , as I gather from what Mr. Bounderby has said , to the service of your country . You have made up your mind , ’

I have seen a little , here and there , up and down ; I have found it all to be very worthless , as everybody has , and as some confess they have , and some do not ; and I am going in for your respected father ’s opinions — really because I have no choice of opinions , and may as well back them as anything else . ’

55329	55438	55461	55461	he	1378	‘ I have not so much as the slightest predilection left . I assure you I attach not the least importance to any opinions . The result of the varieties of boredom I have undergone , is a conviction ( unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on the subject ) , that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set , and just as much harm as any other set . There ’s an English family with a charming Italian motto . What will be , will be . It ’s the only truth going ! ’

57657	57666	57654	57655	the whelp	1387	‘ if it had n’t been for me . ’
57683	57688	57689	57689	he	1387	‘ I persuaded her , ’
57699	57767	57689	57689	he	1387	‘ I was stuck into old Bounderby ’s bank ( where I never wanted to be ) , and I knew I should get into scrapes there , if she put old Bounderby ’s pipe out ; so I told her my wishes , and she came into them . She would do anything for me . It was very game of her , was n’t it ? ’
57768	57775	57654	57655	the whelp	1387	‘ It was charming , Tom ! ’
57776	57792	57794	57794	Tom	71	‘ Not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me , ’
57797	57861	57794	57794	Tom	71	‘ because my liberty and comfort , and perhaps my getting on , depended on it ; and she had no other lover , and staying at home was like staying in jail — especially when I was gone . It was n’t as if she gave up another lover for old Bounderby ; but still it was a good thing in her . ’
57862	57873	57654	57655	the whelp	1387	‘ Perfectly delightful . And she gets on so placidly . ’
57874	57877	57879	57879	Tom	71	‘ Oh , ’
57885	57968	57879	57879	Tom	71	‘ she ’s a regular girl . A girl can get on anywhere . She has settled down to the life , and she do n’t mind . It does just as well as another . Besides , though Loo is a girl , she ’s not a common sort of girl . She can shut herself up within herself , and think — as I have often known her sit and watch the fire — for an hour at a stretch . ’
57969	57980	57982	57982	Harthouse	167	‘ Ay , ay ? Has resources of her own , ’
57987	57998	58000	58000	Tom	71	‘ Not so much of that as you may suppose , ’
58002	58023	58000	58000	Tom	71	‘ for our governor had her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust . It ’s his system . ’

58220	58273	58274	58274	he	1387	‘ My intelligent sister is about where she was . She used to complain to me that she had nothing to fall back upon , that girls usually fall back upon ; and I do n’t see how she is to have got over that since . But she do n’t mind , ’

58408	58424	58426	58426	Tom	71	‘ Mother Sparsit ’s feeling for Loo is more than admiration , I should think , ’
58428	58451	58426	58426	Tom	71	‘ Say affection and devotion . Mother Sparsit never set her cap at Bounderby when he was a bachelor . Oh no ! ’

58563	58572	58574	58574	Tom	71	‘ It ’s — it ’s ridiculously mild , ’

58586	58757	58760	58761	my friends	1421	‘ He had another odd dream of being taken by a waiter through a mist , which , after giving him some trouble and difficulty , resolved itself into the main street , in which he stood alone . He then walked home pretty easily , though not yet free from an impression of the presence and influence of his new friend — as if he were lounging somewhere in the air , in the same negligent attitude , regarding him with the same look . The whelp went home , and went to bed . If he had had any sense of what he had done that night , and had been less of a whelp and more of a brother , he might have turned short on the road , might have gone down to the ill - smelling river that was dyed black , might have gone to bed in it for good and all , and have curtained his head for ever with its filthy waters . ‘
58891	58892	59608	59608	men	545	’ ‘

58907	59597	59608	59608	men	545	’ and other cries , arose in many voices from various parts of the densely crowded and suffocatingly close Hall , in which the orator , perched on a stage , delivered himself of this and what other froth and fume he had in him . He had declaimed himself into a violent heat , and was as hoarse as he was hot . By dint of roaring at the top of his voice under a flaring gaslight , clenching his fists , knitting his brows , setting his teeth , and pounding with his arms , he had taken so much out of himself by this time , that he was brought to a stop , and called for a glass of water . As he stood there , trying to quench his fiery face with his drink of water , the comparison between the orator and the crowd of attentive faces turned towards him , was extremely to his disadvantage . Judging him by Nature ’s evidence , he was above the mass in very little but the stage on which he stood . In many great respects he was essentially below them . He was not so honest , he was not so manly , he was not so good - humoured ; he substituted cunning for their simplicity , and passion for their safe solid sense . An ill - made , high - shouldered man , with lowering brows , and his features crushed into an habitually sour expression , he contrasted most unfavourably , even in his mongrel dress , with the great body of his hearers in their plain working clothes . Strange as it always is to consider any assembly in the act of submissively resigning itself to the dreariness of some complacent person , lord or commoner , whom three - fourths of it could , by no human means , raise out of the slough of inanity to their own intellectual level , it was particularly strange , and it was even particularly affecting , to see this crowd of earnest faces , whose honesty in the main no competent observer free from bias could doubt , so agitated by such a leader . Good ! Hear , hear ! Hurrah ! The eagerness both of attention and intention , exhibited in all the countenances , made them a most impressive sight . There was no carelessness , no languor , no idle curiosity ; none of the many shades of indifference to be seen in all other assemblies , visible for one moment there . That every man felt his condition to be , somehow or other , worse than it might be ; that every man considered it incumbent on him to join the rest , towards the making of it better ; that every man felt his only hope to be in his allying himself to the comrades by whom he was surrounded ; and that in this belief , right or wrong ( unhappily wrong then ) , the whole of that crowd were gravely , deeply , faithfully in earnest ; must have been as plain to any one who chose to see what was there , as the bare beams of the roof and the whitened brick walls . Nor could any such spectator fail to know in his own breast , that these men , through their very delusions , showed great qualities , susceptible of being turned to the happiest and best account ; and that to pretend ( on the strength of sweeping axioms , howsoever cut and dried ) that they went astray wholly without cause , and of their own irrational wills , was to pretend that there could be smoke without fire , death without birth , harvest without seed , anything or everything produced from nothing . The orator having refreshed himself , wiped his corrugated forehead from left to right several times with his handkerchief folded into a pad , and concentrated all his revived forces , in a sneer of great disdain and bitterness . ‘
59820	59854	59887	59889	one strong voice	1452	’ The assembly was divided at this point . There were some groans and hisses , but the general sense of honour was much too strong for the condemnation of a man unheard . ‘

Then was it not the sacred duty of the men of Coketown , with forefathers before them , an admiring world in company with them , and a posterity to come after them , to hurl out traitors from the tents they had pitched in a sacred and a God - like cause ? The winds of heaven answered Yes ; and bore Yes , east , west , north , and south . And consequently three cheers for the United Aggregate Tribunal ! Slackbridge acted as fugleman , and gave the time . The multitude of doubtful faces ( a little conscience - stricken ) brightened at the sound , and took it up . Private feeling must yield to the common cause . Hurrah ! The roof yet vibrated with the cheering , when the assembly dispersed . Thus easily did Stephen Blackpool fall into the loneliest of lives , the life of solitude among a familiar crowd . The stranger in the land who looks into ten thousand faces for some answering look and never finds it , is in cheering society as compared with him who passes ten averted faces daily , that were once the countenances of friends . Such experience was to be Stephen ’s now , in every waking moment of his life ; at his work , on his way to it and from it , at his door , at his window , everywhere . By general consent , they even avoided that side of the street on which he habitually walked ; and left it , of all the working men , to him only . He had been for many years , a quiet silent man , associating but little with other men , and used to companionship with his own thoughts . He had never known before the strength of the want in his heart for the frequent recognition of a nod , a look , a word ; or the immense amount of relief that had been poured into it by drops through such small means . It was even harder than he could have believed possible , to separate in his own conscience his abandonment by all his fellows from a baseless sense of shame and disgrace . The first four days of his endurance were days so long and heavy , that he began to be appalled by the prospect before him . Not only did he see no Rachael all the time , but he avoided every chance of seeing her ; for , although he knew that the prohibition did not yet formally extend to the women working in the factories , he found that some of them with whom he was acquainted were changed to him , and he feared to try others , and dreaded that Rachael might be even singled out from the rest if she were seen in his company . So , he had been quite alone during the four days , and had spoken to no one , when , as he was leaving his work at night , a young man of a very light complexion accosted him in the street . ‘
62156	62204	62150	62150	Blackpool	144	’ said the young man . Stephen coloured to find himself with his hat in his hand , in his gratitude for being spoken to , or in the suddenness of it , or both . He made a feint of adjusting the lining , and said , ‘

67516	67573	67511	67511	I	0	’ Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain , when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs , and calling him to the door , whispered in his ear . Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf , for she caught a word as it was uttered . ‘
67576	67591	67574	67574	Bounderby	93	’ she cried , in a suppressed voice , starting up from the table . ‘
67622	67652	67656	67656	missus	901	’ She trembled , and was excessively agitated ; getting behind Rachael , when Rachael tried to reassure her ; and not seeming to know what she was about . ‘
67660	67666	67656	67656	missus	901	’ said Stephen , astonished . ‘
67667	67672	67656	67656	missus	901	’ Tisn’t Mr. Bounderby ; ’

67716	67723	67704	67704	you	1623	’ she asked , still trembling . ‘

67747	67753	67704	67704	you	1623	’ said the old woman . ‘
67764	68165	67759	67759	myself	0	’ Stephen nodded ; looking to Rachael for an explanation , which she was quite unable to give him ; took the candle , went downstairs , and in a few moments returned , lighting Louisa into the room . She was followed by the whelp . Rachael had risen , and stood apart with her shawl and bonnet in her hand , when Stephen , himself profoundly astonished by this visit , put the candle on the table . Then he too stood , with his doubled hand upon the table near it , waiting to be addressed . For the first time in her life Louisa had come into one of the dwellings of the Coketown Hands ; for the first time in her life she was face to face with anything like individuality in connection with them . She knew of their existence by hundreds and by thousands . She knew what results in work a given number of them would produce in a given space of time . She knew them in crowds passing to and from their nests , like ants or beetles . But she knew from her reading infinitely more of the ways of toiling insects than of these toiling men and women . Something to be worked so much and paid so much , and there ended ; something to be infallibly settled by laws of supply and demand ; something that blundered against those laws , and floundered into difficulty ; something that was a little pinched when wheat was dear , and over - ate itself when wheat was cheap ; something that increased at such a rate of percentage , and yielded such another percentage of crime , and such another percentage of pauperism ; something wholesale , of which vast fortunes were made ; something that occasionally rose like a sea , and did some harm and waste ( chiefly to itself ) , and fell again ; this she knew the Coketown Hands to be . But , she had scarcely thought more of separating them into units , than of separating the sea itself into its component drops . She stood for some moments looking round the room . From the few chairs , the few books , the common prints , and the bed , she glanced to the two women , and to Stephen . ‘
68202	68218	68219	68219	I	0	’ Rachael raised her eyes , and they sufficiently answered no , and dropped again . ‘
68222	68231	68219	68219	I	0	’ said Louisa , reddening at her mistake ; ‘
68312	68348	68349	68349	He	1629	’ As Stephen had but a little while ago instinctively addressed himself to her , so she now instinctively addressed herself to Rachael . Her manner was short and abrupt , yet faltering and timid . ‘

68639	68671	68632	68632	I	0	’ Stephen had remained quietly attentive , in his usual thoughtful attitude , with his hand at his chin . He now spoke in a voice rather less steady than usual . ‘

68779	68791	68792	68792	Weel	183	’ she asked him . And her voice had softened too . ‘
68796	68810	68792	68792	Weel	183	’ said Stephen , making the best of it , with a smile ; ‘
68845	68853	68794	68794	ma’am	361	’ — cept laying down and dying . ’
68854	68860	68794	68794	ma’am	361	‘ How will you travel ? ’
68861	68870	68871	68871	Louisa	92	‘ Afoot , my kind ledy , afoot . ’
68903	68940	68893	68893	she	92	‘ Rachael , will you tell him — for you know how , without offence — that this is freely his , to help him on his way ? Will you entreat him to take it ? ’
68941	68950	68951	68951	she	92	‘ I canna do that , young lady , ’
68959	68965	68951	68951	she	92	‘ Bless you for thinking o ’
68970	68975	68893	68893	she	92	’ such tenderness . But ’
68992	69071	68955	68955	her	92	’ Louisa looked , in part incredulous , in part frightened , in part overcome with quick sympathy , when this man of so much self - command , who had been so plain and steady through the late interview , lost his composure in a moment , and now stood with his hand before his face . She stretched out hers , as if she would have touched him ; then checked herself , and remained still . ‘
69076	69089	69091	69091	mak	1650	’ said Stephen , when he stood again with his face uncovered , ‘

69354	69362	69363	69363	Stephen	144	‘ It do n’t want a light . ’
69383	69387	69388	69388	he	71	‘ I say ! ’
69391	69427	69388	69388	he	71	‘ I think I can do you a good turn . Do n’t ask me what it is , because it may not come to anything . But there ’s no harm in my trying . ’
69446	69456	69458	69458	Tom	71	‘ That was our light porter at the Bank , ’
69460	69485	69458	69458	Tom	71	‘ who brought you the message to - night . I call him our light porter , because I belong to the Bank too . ’
69489	69497	69486	69486	Stephen	144	‘ What a hurry he is in ! ’
69503	69506	69508	69508	Tom	71	‘ Well ! ’
69510	69520	69508	69508	Tom	71	‘ Now look here ! When are you off ? ’

I am not sure that I can do you the good turn I want to do you — that ’s my sister , you know , in your room — but I may be able to , and if I should not be able to , there ’s no harm done . So I tell you what . You ’ll know our light porter again ? ’
69628	69633	69635	69635	Stephen	144	‘ Yes , sure , ’
69637	69641	69643	69643	Tom	71	‘ Very well , ’
69645	69749	69750	69750	He	1655	‘ When you leave work of a night , between this and your going away , just hang about the Bank an hour or so , will you ? Do n’t take on , as if you meant anything , if he should see you hanging about there ; because I sha n’t put him up to speak to you , unless I find I can do you the service I want to do you . In that case he ’ll have a note or a message for you , but not else . Now look here ! You are sure you understand . ’
69789	69795	69797	69797	Stephen	144	‘ I understand , sir , ’
69799	69804	69806	69806	Tom	71	‘ Now look here ! ’
69808	69853	69806	69806	Tom	71	‘ Be sure you do n’t make any mistake then , and do n’t forget . I shall tell my sister as we go home , what I have in view , and she ’ll approve , I know . Now look here ! You ’re
69875	69976	69978	69978	she	1657	’ He pushed the door open as he called to her , but did not return into the room , or wait to be lighted down the narrow stairs . He was at the bottom when she began to descend , and was in the street before she could take his arm . Mrs. Pegler remained in her corner until the brother and sister were gone , and until Stephen came back with the candle in his hand . She was in a state of inexpressible admiration of Mrs. Bounderby , and , like an unaccountable old woman , wept , ‘
69985	70052	69978	69978	she	1657	’ Yet Mrs. Pegler was so flurried lest the object of her admiration should return by chance , or anybody else should come , that her cheerfulness was ended for that night . It was late too , to people who rose early and worked hard ; therefore the party broke up ; and Stephen and Rachael escorted their mysterious acquaintance to the door of the Travellers ’

70231	70250	70164	70165	one another	551	’ Tis not for that , Stephen , that I mind . But thou know’st our old agreement . ’

70261	70265	70164	70165	one another	551	’ said he . ‘

70273	70288	70164	70165	one another	551	‘ Thou’lt write to me , and tell me all that happens , Stephen ? ’
70289	70302	70164	70165	one another	551	‘ Yes . What can I say now , but Heaven be wi ’

70350	70355	70343	70343	I	0	’ said Stephen Blackpool — ‘
70367	70398	70343	70343	I	0	’ onnything that angered me , but thou , so much better than me , should’st be beside it . Thou’rt beside it now . Thou mak’st me see it wi ’
70413	71449	70343	70343	I	0	’ It was but a hurried parting in a common street , yet it was a sacred remembrance to these two common people . Utilitarian economists , skeletons of schoolmasters , Commissioners of Fact , genteel and used - up infidels , gabblers of many little dog’s - eared creeds , the poor you will have always with you . Cultivate in them , while there is yet time , the utmost graces of the fancies and affections , to adorn their lives so much in need of ornament ; or , in the day of your triumph , when romance is utterly driven out of their souls , and they and a bare existence stand face to face , Reality will take a wolfish turn , and make an end of you . Stephen worked the next day , and the next , uncheered by a word from any one , and shunned in all his comings and goings as before . At the end of the second day , he saw land ; at the end of the third , his loom stood empty . He had overstayed his hour in the street outside the Bank , on each of the two first evenings ; and nothing had happened there , good or bad . That he might not be remiss in his part of the engagement , he resolved to wait full two hours , on this third and last night . There was the lady who had once kept Mr. Bounderby ’s house , sitting at the first - floor window as he had seen her before ; and there was the light porter , sometimes talking with her there , and sometimes looking over the blind below which had Bank upon it , and sometimes coming to the door and standing on the steps for a breath of air . When he first came out , Stephen thought he might be looking for him , and passed near ; but the light porter only cast his winking eyes upon him slightly , and said nothing . Two hours were a long stretch of lounging about , after a long day ’s labour . Stephen sat upon the step of a door , leaned against a wall under an archway , strolled up and down , listened for the church clock , stopped and watched children playing in the street . Some purpose or other is so natural to every one , that a mere loiterer always looks and feels remarkable . When the first hour was out , Stephen even began to have an uncomfortable sensation upon him of being for the time a disreputable character . Then came the lamplighter , and two lengthening lines of light all down the long perspective of the street , until they were blended and lost in the distance . Mrs. Sparsit closed the first - floor window , drew down the blind , and went up - stairs . Presently , a light went up - stairs after her , passing first the fanlight of the door , and afterwards the two staircase windows , on its way up . By and by , one corner of the second - floor blind was disturbed , as if Mrs. Sparsit ’s eye were there ; also the other corner , as if the light porter ’s eye were on that side . Still , no communication was made to Stephen . Much relieved when the two hours were at last accomplished , he went away at a quick pace , as a recompense for so much loitering . He had only to take leave of his landlady , and lie down on his temporary bed upon the floor ; for his bundle was made up for to - morrow , and all was arranged for his departure . He meant to be clear of the town very early ; before the Hands were in the streets . It was barely daybreak , when , with a parting look round his room , mournfully wondering whether he should ever see it again , he went out . The town was as entirely deserted as if the inhabitants had abandoned it , rather than hold communication with him . Everything looked wan at that hour . Even the coming sun made but a pale waste in the sky , like a sad sea . By the place where Rachael lived , though it was not in his way ; by the red brick streets ; by the great silent factories , not trembling yet ; by the railway , where the danger - lights were waning in the strengthening day ; by the railway ’s crazy neighbourhood , half pulled down and half built up ; by scattered red brick villas , where the besmoked evergreens were sprinkled with a dirty powder , like untidy snuff - takers ; by coal - dust paths and many varieties of ugliness ; Stephen got to the top of the hill , and looked back . Day was shining radiantly upon the town then , and the bells were going for the morning work . Domestic fires were not yet lighted , and the high chimneys had the sky to themselves . Puffing out their poisonous volumes , they would not be long in hiding it ; but , for half an hour , some of the many windows were golden , which showed the Coketown people a sun eternally in eclipse , through a medium of smoked glass . So strange to turn from the chimneys to the birds . So strange , to have the road - dust on his feet instead of the coal - grit . So strange to have lived to his time of life , and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer morning ! With these musings in his mind , and his bundle under his arm , Stephen took his attentive face along the high road . And the trees arched over him , whispering that he left a true and loving heart behind . Mr. James Harthouse , ‘
71452	71569	70343	70343	I	0	’ for his adopted party , soon began to score . With the aid of a little more coaching for the political sages , a little more genteel listlessness for the general society , and a tolerable management of the assumed honesty in dishonesty , most effective and most patronized of the polite deadly sins , he speedily came to be considered of much promise . The not being troubled with earnestness was a grand point in his favour , enabling him to take to the hard Fact fellows with as good a grace as if he had been born one of the tribe , and to throw all other tribes overboard , as conscious hypocrites . ‘
71634	72013	72321	72322	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ Why should she be shocked or warned by this reiteration ? It was not so unlike her father ’s principles , and her early training , that it need startle her . Where was the great difference between the two schools , when each chained her down to material realities , and inspired her with no faith in anything else ? What was there in her soul for James Harthouse to destroy , which Thomas Gradgrind had nurtured there in its state of innocence ! It was even the worse for her at this pass , that in her mind — implanted there before her eminently practical father began to form it — a struggling disposition to believe in a wider and nobler humanity than she had ever heard of , constantly strove with doubts and resentments . With doubts , because the aspiration had been so laid waste in her youth . With resentments , because of the wrong that had been done her , if it were indeed a whisper of the truth . Upon a nature long accustomed to self - suppression , thus torn and divided , the Harthouse philosophy came as a relief and justification . Everything being hollow and worthless , she had missed nothing and sacrificed nothing . What did it matter , she had said to her father , when he proposed her husband . What did it matter , she said still . With a scornful self - reliance , she asked herself , What did anything matter — and went on . Towards what ? Step by step , onward and downward , towards some end , yet so gradually , that she believed herself to remain motionless . As to Mr. Harthouse , whither he tended , he neither considered nor cared . He had no particular design or plan before him : no energetic wickedness ruffled his lassitude . He was as much amused and interested , at present , as it became so fine a gentleman to be ; perhaps even more than it would have been consistent with his reputation to confess . Soon after his arrival he languidly wrote to his brother , the honourable and jocular member , that the Bounderbys were ‘
72017	72309	72321	72322	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ and further , that the female Bounderby , instead of being the Gorgon he had expected , was young , and remarkably pretty . After that , he wrote no more about them , and devoted his leisure chiefly to their house . He was very often in their house , in his flittings and visitings about the Coketown district ; and was much encouraged by Mr. Bounderby . It was quite in Mr. Bounderby ’s gusty way to boast to all his world that he did n’t care about your highly connected people , but that if his wife Tom Gradgrind ’s daughter did , she was welcome to their company . Mr. James Harthouse began to think it would be a new sensation , if the face which changed so beautifully for the whelp , would change for him . He was quick enough to observe ; he had a good memory , and did not forget a word of the brother ’s revelations . He interwove them with everything he saw of the sister , and he began to understand her . To be sure , the better and profounder part of her character was not within his scope of perception ; for in natures , as in seas , depth answers unto depth ; but he soon began to read the rest with a student ’s eye . Mr. Bounderby had taken possession of a house and grounds , about fifteen miles from the town , and accessible within a mile or two , by a railway striding on many arches over a wild country , undermined by deserted coal - shafts , and spotted at night by fires and black shapes of stationary engines at pits ’
72484	72489	72490	72490	he	93	‘ Why , sir , ’
72497	72504	72490	72490	he	93	‘ I am told that Nickits , ’
72509	72607	72505	72507	the late owner	1684	‘ gave seven hundred pound for that Seabeach . Now , to be plain with you , if I ever , in the whole course of my life , take seven looks at it , at a hundred pound a look , it will be as much as I shall do . No , by George ! I do n’t forget that I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown . For years upon years , the only pictures in my possession , or that I could have got into my possession , by any means , unless I stole ’em
72657	72669	72670	72670	Harthouse	167	’ Then he would address Mr. Harthouse in the same style . ‘
72696	72725	72670	72670	Harthouse	167	’em . There ’s stabling in this place for a dozen horses ; and unless Nickits is belied , he kept the full number . A round dozen of ’em
72795	72816	72818	72818	sir	2771	’em in their stalls here , and think what my own lodging used to be . I could n’t look at ’em
72823	72970	72789	72789	I	0	’em out . Yet so things come round . You see this place ; you know what sort of a place it is ; you are aware that there ’s not a completer place of its size in this kingdom or elsewhere — I do n’t care where — and here , got into the middle of it , like a maggot into a nut , is Josiah Bounderby . While Nickits ( as a man came into my office , and told me yesterday ) , Nickits , who used to act in Latin , in the Westminster School plays , with the chief - justices and nobility of this country applauding him till they were black in the face , is drivelling at this minute — drivelling , sir ! — in a fifth floor , up a narrow dark back street in Antwerp . ’
73017	73049	72989	72990	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ Mrs. Bounderby , I esteem it a most fortunate accident that I find you alone here . I have for some time had a particular wish to speak to you . ’
73134	73143	73121	73121	He	167	‘ Your brother . My young friend Tom — ’
73159	73166	73167	73167	he	167	‘ I never in my life , ’
73170	73185	73167	73167	he	167	‘ saw anything so remarkable and so captivating as the lighting of those features ! ’
73210	73246	73149	73149	she	1696	‘ Pardon me . The expression of your sisterly interest is so beautiful — Tom should be so proud of it — I know this is inexcusable , but I am so compelled to admire . ’
73247	73252	73253	73253	she	1696	‘ Being so impulsive , ’
73257	73304	73253	73253	she	1696	‘ Mrs. Bounderby , no : you know I make no pretence with you . You know I am a sordid piece of human nature , ready to sell myself at any time for any reasonable sum , and altogether incapable of any Arcadian proceeding whatever . ’
73305	73310	73149	73149	she	1696	‘ I am waiting , ’
73314	73323	73253	73253	she	1696	‘ for your further reference to my brother . ’
73324	73379	73149	73149	she	1696	‘ You are rigid with me , and I deserve it . I am as worthless a dog as you will find , except that I am not false — not false . But you surprised and started me from my subject , which was your brother . I have an interest in him . ’
73380	73391	73392	73392	she	1696	‘ Have you an interest in anything , Mr. Harthouse ? ’
73401	73444	73445	73445	She	1696	‘ If you had asked me when I first came here , I should have said no . I must say now — even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence , and of justly awakening your incredulity — yes . ’
73470	73485	73467	73467	she	1696	‘ Mr. Harthouse , I give you credit for being interested in my brother . ’
73486	73565	73566	73566	She	1702	‘ Thank you . I claim to deserve it . You know how little I do claim , but I will go that length . You have done so much for him , you are so fond of him ; your whole life , Mrs. Bounderby , expresses such charming self - forgetfulness on his account — pardon me again — I am running wide of the subject . I am interested in him for his own sake . ’
73604	73608	73609	73609	he	1703	‘ Mrs. Bounderby , ’
73639	73677	73609	73609	he	1703	‘ it is no irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your brother ’s years , if he is heedless , inconsiderate , and expensive — a little dissipated , in the common phrase . Is he ? ’
73678	73681	73719	73719	she	1702	‘ Yes . ’
73682	73697	73719	73719	she	1702	‘ Allow me to be frank . Do you think he games at all ? ’
73698	73705	73719	73719	she	1702	‘ I think he makes bets . ’
73722	73728	73719	73719	she	1702	‘ I know he does . ’
73729	73735	73719	73719	she	1702	‘ Of course he loses ? ’
73736	73739	73719	73719	she	1702	‘ Yes . ’
73740	73764	73765	73765	She	1702	‘ Everybody does lose who bets . May I hint at the probability of your sometimes supplying him with money for these purposes ? ’
73786	73841	73778	73778	her	1702	‘ Acquit me of impertinent curiosity , my dear Mrs. Bounderby . I think Tom may be gradually falling into trouble , and I wish to stretch out a helping hand to him from the depths of my wicked experience . — Shall I say again , for his sake ? Is that necessary ? ’
73855	73866	73868	73869	James Harthouse	167	‘ Candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me , ’
73885	73926	73868	73869	James Harthouse	167	‘ I will confide to you my doubt whether he has had many advantages . Whether — forgive my plainness — whether any great amount of confidence is likely to have been established between himself and his most worthy father . ’
73927	73932	73934	73934	Louisa	92	‘ I do not , ’
73946	73951	73938	73938	her	92	‘ think it likely . ’
73952	73985	73986	73986	She	92	‘ Or , between himself , and — I may trust to your perfect understanding of my meaning , I am sure — and his highly esteemed brother - in - law . ’
74004	74014	73997	73997	she	92	‘ I do not think that likely , either . ’
74015	74019	74021	74021	Harthouse	167	‘ Mrs. Bounderby , ’
74028	74049	74021	74021	Harthouse	167	‘ may there be a better confidence between yourself and me ? Tom has borrowed a considerable sum of you ? ’
74050	74058	74059	74059	she	92	‘ You will understand , Mr. Harthouse , ’
74093	74138	74066	74066	she	92	‘ you will understand that if I tell you what you press to know , it is not by way of complaint or regret . I would never complain of anything , and what I have done I do not in the least regret . ’
74139	74145	74147	74148	James Harthouse	167	‘ So spirited , too ! ’
74150	74212	74214	74214	she	1704	‘ When I married , I found that my brother was even at that time heavily in debt . Heavily for him , I mean . Heavily enough to oblige me to sell some trinkets . They were no sacrifice . I sold them very willingly . I attached no value to them . They , were quite worthless to me . ’
74279	74416	74417	74417	She	1707	‘ Since then , I have given my brother , at various times , what money I could spare : in short , what money I have had . Confiding in you at all , on the faith of the interest you profess for him , I will not do so by halves . Since you have been in the habit of visiting here , he has wanted in one sum as much as a hundred pounds . I have not been able to give it to him . I have felt uneasy for the consequences of his being so involved , but I have kept these secrets until now , when I trust them to your honour . I have held no confidence with any one , because — you anticipated my reason just now . ’
74452	74654	74656	74656	she	1711	‘ Mrs. Bounderby , though a graceless person , of the world worldly , I feel the utmost interest , I assure you , in what you tell me . I can not possibly be hard upon your brother . I understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his errors . With all possible respect both for Mr. Gradgrind and for Mr. Bounderby , I think I perceive that he has not been fortunate in his training . Bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he has his part to play , he rushes into these extremes for himself , from opposite extremes that have long been forced — with the very best intentions we have no doubt — upon him . Mr. Bounderby ’s fine bluff English independence , though a most charming characteristic , does not — as we have agreed — invite confidence . If I might venture to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken , a character misconceived , and abilities misdirected , would turn for relief and guidance , I should express what it presents to my own view . ’
74692	74696	74697	74697	he	1713	‘ All allowance , ’
74700	74733	74697	74697	he	1713	‘ must be made . I have one great fault to find with Tom , however , which I can not forgive , and for which I take him heavily to account . ’
74750	74753	74754	74754	he	1713	‘ Perhaps , ’
74757	74783	74754	74754	he	1713	‘ I have said enough . Perhaps it would have been better , on the whole , if no allusion to it had escaped me . ’
74784	74798	74736	74736	her	92	‘ You alarm me , Mr. Harthouse . Pray let me know it . ’
74799	74953	74754	74754	he	1713	‘ To relieve you from needless apprehension — and as this confidence regarding your brother , which I prize I am sure above all possible things , has been established between us — I obey . I can not forgive him for not being more sensible in every word , look , and act of his life , of the affection of his best friend ; of the devotion of his best friend ; of her unselfishness ; of her sacrifice . The return he makes her , within my observation , is a very poor one . What she has done for him demands his constant love and gratitude , not his ill - humour and caprice . Careless fellow as I am , I am not so indifferent , Mrs. Bounderby , as to be regardless of this vice in your brother , or inclined to consider it a venial offence . ’
74993	75129	75130	75130	he	1716	‘ In a word , it is to correct your brother in this , Mrs. Bounderby , that I must aspire . My better knowledge of his circumstances , and my direction and advice in extricating them — rather valuable , I hope , as coming from a scapegrace on a much larger scale — will give me some influence over him , and all I gain I shall certainly use towards this end . I have said enough , and more than enough . I seem to be protesting that I am a sort of good fellow , when , upon my honour , I have not the least intention to make any protestation to that effect , and openly announce that I am nothing of the sort . Yonder , among the trees , ’
75151	75238	75239	75239	He	1716	‘ is your brother himself ; no doubt , just come down . As he seems to be loitering in this direction , it may be as well , perhaps , to walk towards him , and throw ourselves in his way . He has been very silent and doleful of late . Perhaps , his brotherly conscience is touched — if there are such things as consciences . Though , upon my honour , I hear of them much too often to believe in them . ’
75307	75310	75311	75311	he	1716	‘ Halloa ! ’
75314	75323	75311	75311	he	1716	‘ I did n’t know you were here . ’
75324	75330	75332	75333	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ Whose name , Tom , ’
75356	75365	75311	75311	he	1716	‘ have you been carving on the trees ? ’
75366	75370	75372	75372	Tom	71	‘ Whose name ? ’
75374	75384	75372	75372	Tom	71	‘ Oh ! You mean what girl ’s name ? ’
75385	75403	75311	75311	he	1716	‘ You have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature ’s on the bark , Tom . ’
75404	75461	75372	75372	Tom	71	‘ Not much of that , Mr. Harthouse , unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me . Or she might be as ugly as she was rich , without any fear of losing me . I ’d carve her name as often as she liked . ’
75462	75472	75311	75311	he	1716	‘ I am afraid you are mercenary , Tom . ’
75473	75476	75478	75478	Tom	71	‘ Mercenary , ’
75480	75490	75478	75478	Tom	71	‘ Who is not mercenary ? Ask my sister . ’
75491	75506	75508	75508	Louisa	92	‘ Have you so proved it to be a failing of mine , Tom ? ’
75522	75533	75535	75536	her brother	2932	‘ You know whether the cap fits you , Loo , ’
75539	75549	75535	75536	her brother	2932	‘ If it does , you can wear it . ’
75550	75567	75569	75570	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ Tom is misanthropical to - day , as all bored people are now and then , ’
75572	75607	75569	75570	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ Do n’t believe him , Mrs. Bounderby . He knows much better . I shall disclose some of his opinions of you , privately expressed to me , unless he relents a little . ’
75608	75616	75618	75618	Tom	71	‘ At all events , Mr. Harthouse , ’
75635	75697	75630	75630	his	71	‘ you ca n’t tell her that I ever praised her for being mercenary . I may have praised her for being the contrary , and I should do it again , if I had as good reason . However , never mind this now ; it ’s not very interesting to you , and I am sick of the subject . ’
75762	75778	75779	75779	They	1724	‘ Tom , my fine fellow , I want to have a word with you . ’
75865	75873	75861	75861	she	1730	‘ Tom , what ’s the matter ? ’
75874	75880	75882	75882	Tom	71	‘ Oh ! Mr. Harthouse , ’
75887	75900	75861	75861	she	1730	‘ I am hard up , and bothered out of my life . ’
75901	75909	75861	75861	she	1730	‘ My good fellow , so am I. ’
75910	75913	75915	75915	Tom	71	‘ You ! ’
75917	75968	75969	75969	He	71	‘ You are the picture of independence . Mr. Harthouse , I am in a horrible mess . You have no idea what a state I have got myself into — what a state my sister might have got me out of , if she would only have done it . ’
76012	76042	76004	76005	his companion	1410	‘ Tom , you are inconsiderate : you expect too much of your sister . You have had money of her , you dog , you know you have . ’
76043	76150	76151	76151	He	1733	‘ Well , Mr. Harthouse , I know I have . How else was I to get it ? Here ’s old Bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a month , or something of that sort . Here ’s my father drawing what he calls a line , and tying me down to it from a baby , neck and heels . Here ’s my mother who never has anything of her own , except her complaints . What is a fellow to do for money , and where am I to look for it , if not to my sister ? ’
76173	76188	76164	76165	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ But , my dear Tom , if your sister has not got it — ’
76189	76386	76164	76165	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ Not got it , Mr. Harthouse ? I do n’t say she has got it . I may have wanted more than she was likely to have got . But then she ought to get it . She could get it . It ’s of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now , after what I have told you already ; you know she did n’t marry old Bounderby for her own sake , or for his sake , but for my sake . Then why does n’t she get what I want , out of him , for my sake ? She is not obliged to say what she is going to do with it ; she is sharp enough ; she could manage to coax it out of him , if she chose . Then why does n’t she choose , when I tell her of what consequence it is ? But no . There she sits in his company like a stone , instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily . I do n’t know what you may call this , but I call it unnatural conduct . ’
76466	76471	76473	76473	Harthouse	167	‘ My dear Tom , ’
76475	76484	76473	76473	Harthouse	167	‘ let me try to be your banker . ’
76485	76491	76493	76493	Tom	71	‘ For God ’s sake , ’
76497	76504	76493	76493	Tom	71	‘ do n’t talk about bankers ! ’
76597	76618	76552	76552	he	167	‘ What is the present need , Tom ? Three figures ? Out with them . Say what they are . ’
76619	76623	76625	76625	Tom	71	‘ Mr. Harthouse , ’
76647	76687	76688	76690	a true friend	1738	‘ it ’s too late ; the money is of no use to me at present . I should have had it before to be of use to me . But I am very much obliged to you ; you ’re
76692	76697	76688	76690	a true friend	1738	’ A true friend ! ‘
76702	76709	76688	76690	a true friend	1738	’ thought Mr. Harthouse , lazily ; ‘
76716	76717	76688	76690	a true friend	1738	’ ‘
76728	76736	76719	76719	I	0	’ said Tom , grasping his hand . ‘
76745	76746	76742	76743	Mr. Harthouse	167	’ ‘
76749	76754	76719	76719	I	0	’ returned the other , ‘
76802	76803	76786	76786	I	0	’ ‘
76807	76820	76786	76786	I	0	’ said Tom , shaking his head dismally , and chewing rosebuds . ‘
76832	76833	76829	76830	Mr. Harthouse	167	’ ‘
76841	76882	76839	76839	Tom	71	’ said Mr. Harthouse in conclusion , himself tossing over a rose or two , as a contribution to the island , which was always drifting to the wall as if it wanted to become a part of the mainland : ‘
76910	76920	76905	76905	I	0	’ the languor of his desperation being quite tropical ; ‘
76953	76954	76955	76955	I	0	’ ‘
76962	76963	76959	76960	Mr. Harthouse	167	’ ‘
76976	76977	76979	76979	I	0	’ ‘
76990	76991	76985	76985	Loo	101	’ ‘
76999	77047	76997	76997	Tom	71	’ said Harthouse , clapping him on the shoulder again , with an air which left him at liberty to infer — as he did , poor fool — that this condition was imposed upon him in mere careless good nature to lessen his sense of obligation , ‘
77058	77088	77089	77089	I	0	’ When Tom appeared before dinner , though his mind seemed heavy enough , his body was on the alert ; and he appeared before Mr. Bounderby came in . ‘
77099	77112	77097	77097	Loo	101	’ he said , giving her his hand , and kissing her . ‘
77130	77157	77124	77124	I	0	’ After this , there was a smile upon Louisa ’s face that day , for some one else . Alas , for some one else ! ‘
77173	77192	77124	77124	I	0	’ thought James Harthouse , reversing the reflection of his first day ’s knowledge of her pretty face . ‘
77203	77665	77124	77124	I	0	’ The next morning was too bright a morning for sleep , and James Harthouse rose early , and sat in the pleasant bay window of his dressing - room , smoking the rare tobacco that had had so wholesome an influence on his young friend . Reposing in the sunlight , with the fragrance of his eastern pipe about him , and the dreamy smoke vanishing into the air , so rich and soft with summer odours , he reckoned up his advantages as an idle winner might count his gains . He was not at all bored for the time , and could give his mind to it . He had established a confidence with her , from which her husband was excluded . He had established a confidence with her , that absolutely turned upon her indifference towards her husband , and the absence , now and at all times , of any congeniality between them . He had artfully , but plainly , assured her that he knew her heart in its last most delicate recesses ; he had come so near to her through its tenderest sentiment ; he had associated himself with that feeling ; and the barrier behind which she lived , had melted away . All very odd , and very satisfactory ! And yet he had not , even now , any earnest wickedness of purpose in him . Publicly and privately , it were much better for the age in which he lived , that he and the legion of whom he was one were designedly bad , than indifferent and purposeless . It is the drifting icebergs setting with any current anywhere , that wreck the ships . When the Devil goeth about like a roaring lion , he goeth about in a shape by which few but savages and hunters are attracted . But , when he is trimmed , smoothed , and varnished , according to the mode ; when he is aweary of vice , and aweary of virtue , used up as to brimstone , and used up as to bliss ; then , whether he take to the serving out of red tape , or to the kindling of red fire , he is the very Devil . So James Harthouse reclined in the window , indolently smoking , and reckoning up the steps he had taken on the road by which he happened to be travelling . The end to which it led was before him , pretty plainly ; but he troubled himself with no calculations about it . What will be , will be . As he had rather a long ride to take that day — for there was a public occasion ‘
77668	77820	77124	77124	I	0	’ at some distance , which afforded a tolerable opportunity of going in for the Gradgrind men — he dressed early and went down to breakfast . He was anxious to see if she had relapsed since the previous evening . No . He resumed where he had left off . There was a look of interest for him again . He got through the day as much ( or as little ) to his own satisfaction , as was to be expected under the fatiguing circumstances ; and came riding back at six o’clock . There was a sweep of some half - mile between the lodge and the house , and he was riding along at a foot pace over the smooth gravel , once Nickits ’s , when Mr. Bounderby burst out of the shrubbery , with such violence as to make his horse shy across the road . ‘
77823	77828	77821	77821	Harthouse	167	’ cried Mr. Bounderby . ‘
77833	77834	77830	77830	you	167	’ ‘
77838	77856	77830	77830	you	167	’ said Harthouse , soothing his horse , and inwardly favouring Mr. Bounderby with no good wishes . ‘
77863	77864	77858	77858	you	167	’ ‘
77882	77912	77876	77876	I	0	’ Mr. Bounderby , red and hot , planted himself in the centre of the path before the horse ’s head , to explode his bombshell with more effect . ‘

77926	77927	77920	77920	You	167	’ ‘

77951	77974	77920	77920	You	167	’ Mr. Bounderby , in his desire to make the most of it , really seemed mortified by being obliged to reply , ‘

77996	77997	77876	77876	I	0	’ ‘
78021	78028	77876	77876	I	0	’ said Bounderby , with impatience . ‘

78072	78086	78087	78087	I	0	’ said James , dismounting , and giving his bridle to his servant , ‘
78149	78150	78136	78136	I	0	’ ‘
78153	78164	78136	78136	I	0	’ replied Bounderby , in a short , ungracious manner . ‘
78179	78180	78181	78181	I	0	’ ‘

78204	78219	78202	78202	George	72	’ said Mr. Bounderby , with sundry menacing nods and shakes of his head . ‘
78251	78255	78256	78256	Louisa	92	’ being disturbed . ’
78269	78290	78292	78292	Bounderby	93	‘ Here ’s Tom Gradgrind ’s daughter knows pretty well what it might have been , if you do n’t , ’
78294	78330	78292	78292	Bounderby	93	‘ Dropped , sir , as if she was shot when I told her ! Never knew her do such a thing before . Does her credit , under the circumstances , in my opinion ! ’
78364	78374	78376	78376	Bounderby	93	‘ Why , I am going to tell you , ’
78386	78423	78376	78376	Bounderby	93	‘ If you had n’t been so mighty particular about the sum , I should have begun to tell you before . You know this lady ( for she is a lady ) , Mrs. Sparsit ? ’
78424	78432	78457	78457	his	167	‘ I have already had the honour — ’
78433	78453	78457	78457	his	167	‘ Very well . And this young man , Bitzer , you saw him too on the same occasion ? ’
78468	78553	78463	78463	Bitzer	77	‘ Very well . They live at the Bank . You know they live at the Bank , perhaps ? Very well . Yesterday afternoon , at the close of business hours , everything was put away as usual . In the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of , there was never mind how much . In the little safe in young Tom ’s closet , the safe used for petty purposes , there was a hundred and fifty odd pound . ’
78554	78566	78568	78568	Bitzer	77	‘ A hundred and fifty - four , seven , one , ’
78570	78573	78575	78575	Bounderby	93	‘ Come ! ’
78584	78601	78575	78575	Bounderby	93	‘ let ’s have none of your interruptions . It ’s enough to be robbed while you ’re
78605	78659	78660	78660	Bitzer	77	’re too comfortable , without being put right with your four seven ones . I did n’t snore , myself , when I was your age , let me tell you . I had n’t victuals enough to snore . And I did n’t four seven one . Not if I knew it . ’
78691	78699	78701	78702	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ A hundred and fifty odd pound , ’
78704	78762	78701	78702	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ That sum of money , young Tom locked in his safe , not a very strong safe , but that ’s no matter now . Everything was left , all right . Some time in the night , while this young fellow snored — Mrs. Sparsit , ma’am , you say you have heard him snore ? ’
78763	78766	78768	78769	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Sir , ’
78771	78846	78848	78849	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ I can not say that I have heard him precisely snore , and therefore must not make that statement . But on winter evenings , when he has fallen asleep at his table , I have heard him , what I should prefer to describe as partially choke . I have heard him on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in Dutch clocks . Not , ’
78860	78900	78848	78849	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ that I would convey any imputation on his moral character . Far from it . I have always considered Bitzer a young man of the most upright principle ; and to that I beg to bear my testimony . ’
78901	78904	78906	78908	the exasperated Bounderby	93	‘ Well ! ’
78910	79078	78906	78908	the exasperated Bounderby	93	‘ while he was snoring , or choking , or Dutch - clocking , or something or other — being asleep — some fellows , somehow , whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen , got to young Tom ’s safe , forced it , and abstracted the contents . Being then disturbed , they made off ; letting themselves out at the main door , and double - locking it again ( it was double - locked , and the key under Mrs. Sparsit ’s pillow ) with a false key , which was picked up in the street near the Bank , about twelve o’clock to - day . No alarm takes place , till this chap , Bitzer , turns out this morning , and begins to open and prepare the offices for business . Then , looking at Tom ’s safe , he sees the door ajar , and finds the lock forced , and the money gone . ’
79079	79088	79090	79090	Harthouse	167	‘ Where is Tom , by the by ? ’
79095	79103	79105	79105	Bounderby	93	‘ He has been helping the police , ’
79107	79152	79105	79105	Bounderby	93	‘ and stays behind at the Bank . I wish these fellows had tried to rob me when I was at his time of life . They would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job ; I can tell ’em

79175	79190	79173	79173	Egod	190	’ said Bounderby , relinquishing Mrs. Sparsit ’s arm to wipe his heated head . ‘
79209	79218	79207	79207	you	0	’ Might Mr. Harthouse inquire Who was suspected ? ‘
79221	79234	79207	79207	you	0	’ said Bounderby , stopping and facing about to confront them all , ‘
79268	79288	79265	79268	a gang of ’em	4292	’em ) may be thrown off their guard . So take this in confidence . Now wait a bit . ’
79296	79303	79305	79305	he	93	‘ What should you say to ; ’
79309	79317	79305	79305	he	93	‘ to a Hand being in it ? ’
79318	79322	79324	79324	Harthouse	167	‘ I hope , ’
79328	79334	79324	79324	Harthouse	167	‘ not our friend Blackpot ? ’
79335	79344	79346	79346	Bounderby	93	‘ Say Pool instead of Pot , sir , ’
79348	79355	79356	79356	Louisa	92	‘ and that ’s the man . ’
79366	79373	79375	79375	Bounderby	93	‘ O yes ! I know ! ’
79383	79472	79375	79375	Bounderby	93	‘ I know ! I am used to that . I know all about it . They are the finest people in the world , these fellows are . They have got the gift of the gab , they have . They only want to have their rights explained to them , they do . But I tell you what . Show me a dissatisfied Hand , and I ’ll show you a man that ’s fit for anything bad , I do n’t care what it is . ’
79497	79506	79508	79508	Bounderby	93	‘ But I am acquainted with these chaps , ’
79510	79514	79508	79508	Bounderby	93	‘ I can read ’em

79638	79643	79644	79644	you	2771	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , ‘

79685	79698	79699	79699	he	1760	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , with a meek shake of her head , ‘
79745	79763	79764	79764	I	0	’ Mr. Bounderby stared with a bursting pride at Mr. Harthouse , as much as to say , ‘
79782	79789	79773	79773	she	1769	’ Then , resumed his discourse . ‘
79822	79826	79817	79817	I	0	’em . I KNOW ’em
79887	79919	79884	79884	you	361	’ Mr. Bounderby , with his hat in his hand , gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his sentences , as if it were a tambourine ; ‘
79995	80017	79960	79960	her	367	’ Having come to the climax , Mr. Bounderby , like an oriental dancer , put his tambourine on his head . ‘
80020	80025	79960	79960	her	367	’ said James Harthouse , ‘

One never hears of these things till the mischief ’s done ; all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen ; there ’s an old woman turns up now . An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick , every now and then . She watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins , and on the night when you saw him , she steals away with him and holds a council with him — I suppose , to make her report on going off duty , and be damned to her . ’
80195	80201	80187	80187	she	1780	‘ This is not all of ’em

80221	80257	80212	80212	Bounderby	93	‘ But I have said enough for the present . You ’ll have the goodness to keep it quiet , and mention it to no one . It may take time , but we shall have ’em
80264	80276	80212	80212	Bounderby	93	’em line enough , and there ’s no objection to that . ’
80277	80299	80301	80302	James Harthouse	167	‘ Of course , they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law , as notice - boards observe , ’
80304	80335	80336	80336	He	93	‘ and serve them right . Fellows who go in for Banks must take the consequences . If there were no consequences , we should all go in for Banks . ’

80383	80419	80380	80381	her husband	2903	‘ here ’s Mrs. Sparsit to look after . Mrs. Sparsit ’s nerves have been acted upon by this business , and she ’ll stay here a day or two . So make her comfortable . ’

80434	80452	80429	80431	that discreet lady	1783	‘ but pray do not let My comfort be a consideration . Anything will do for Me . ’
80539	80548	80549	80550	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ but it is my duty to remember , ’
80569	80582	80584	80584	she	126	‘ that what I was , I am no longer . Indeed , ’
80586	80653	80584	80584	she	126	‘ if I could altogether cancel the remembrance that Mr. Sparsit was a Powler , or that I myself am related to the Scadgers family ; or if I could even revoke the fact , and make myself a person of common descent and ordinary connexions ; I would gladly do so . I should think it , under existing circumstances , right to do so . ’
80686	80695	80683	80683	she	126	‘ Indeed you are very good , sir ; ’

80845	80851	80837	80837	her	126	‘ Alas , poor Yorick ! ’
80881	80896	80864	80864	she	126	‘ You have still good spirits , sir , I am thankful to find ; ’

81211	81236	81208	81209	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Try a hand at backgammon , sir , as you used to do when I had the honour of living under your roof . ’
81237	81246	81248	81249	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ I have n’t played backgammon , ma’am , ’
81251	81256	81248	81249	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ since that time . ’

81269	81303	81264	81265	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ I am aware that you have not . I remember that Miss Gradgrind takes no interest in the game . But I shall be happy , sir , if you will condescend . ’

81423	81436	81438	81439	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ What have you got to do with the dew , ma’am ? ’
81441	81449	81438	81439	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ It ’s not myself , sir , ’
81454	81465	81451	81452	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ I am fearful of Miss Gradgrind ’s taking cold . ’
81466	81472	81474	81475	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ She never takes cold , ’
81477	81482	81484	81485	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Really , sir ? ’
81513	81518	81520	81521	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Oh , sir ? ’
81523	81536	81520	81521	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Not your sherry warm , with lemon - peel and nutmeg ? ’
81537	81554	81556	81557	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ Why , I have got out of the habit of taking it now , ma’am , ’
81559	81568	81556	81557	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ The more ’s the pity , sir , ’
81573	81610	81570	81571	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ you are losing all your good old habits . Cheer up , sir ! If Miss Gradgrind will permit me , I will offer to make it for you , as I have often done . ’
81637	81668	81634	81635	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ It will do you good , sir . It will warm your heart . It is the sort of thing you want , and ought to take , sir . ’

82034	82050	82074	82074	she	92	‘ I do n’t know what you mean , Loo . You have been dreaming . ’
82051	82056	82057	82057	she	92	‘ My dear brother : ’
82084	82124	82074	82074	she	92	‘ is there nothing that you have to tell me ? Is there nothing you can tell me if you will ? You can tell me nothing that will change me . O Tom , tell me the truth ! ’

82137	82222	82246	82246	she	1810	‘ As you lie here alone , my dear , in the melancholy night , so you must lie somewhere one night , when even I , if I am living then , shall have left you . As I am here beside you , barefoot , unclothed , undistinguishable in darkness , so must I lie through all the night of my decay , until I am dust . In the name of that time , Tom , tell me the truth now ! ’
82223	82232	82246	82246	she	1810	‘ What is it you want to know ? ’
82233	82239	82246	82246	she	1810	‘ You may be certain ; ’
82259	82320	82246	82246	she	1810	‘ that I will not reproach you . You may be certain that I will be compassionate and true to you . You may be certain that I will save you at whatever cost . O Tom , have you nothing to tell me ? Whisper very softly . Say only “ yes , ” and I shall understand you ! ’
82335	82342	82323	82323	her	1810	‘ Not a word , Tom ? ’
82343	82405	82418	82418	her	1810	‘ How can I say Yes , or how can I say No , when I do n’t know what you mean ? Loo , you are a brave , kind girl , worthy I begin to think of a better brother than I am . But I have nothing more to say . Go to bed , go to bed . ’
82406	82411	82412	82412	she	1810	‘ You are tired , ’
82422	82431	82412	82412	she	1810	‘ Yes , I am quite tired out . ’
82432	82451	82418	82418	her	1810	‘ You have been so hurried and disturbed to - day . Have any fresh discoveries been made ? ’
82452	82464	82418	82418	her	1810	‘ Only those you have heard of , from — him . ’
82465	82491	82418	82418	her	1810	‘ Tom , have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people , and that we saw those three together ? ’
82492	82516	82418	82418	her	1810	‘ No . Did n’t you yourself particularly ask me to keep it quiet when you asked me to go there with you ? ’
82517	82532	82418	82418	her	1810	‘ Yes . But I did not know then what was going to happen . ’
82533	82542	82418	82418	her	1810	‘ Nor I neither . How could I ? ’
82553	82564	82574	82574	she	716	‘ Ought I to say , after what has happened , ’
82582	82599	82574	82574	she	716	‘ that I made that visit ? Should I say so ? Must I say so ? ’
82600	82606	82608	82609	her brother	2932	‘ Good Heavens , Loo , ’
82611	82654	82608	82609	her brother	2932	‘ you are not in the habit of asking my advice . Say what you like . If you keep it to yourself , I shall keep it to myself . If you disclose it , there ’s an end of it . ’
82680	82701	82669	82669	each	2857	‘ Tom , do you believe the man I gave the money to , is really implicated in this crime ? ’
82702	82718	82751	82751	he	1819	‘ I do n’t know . I do n’t see why he should n’t be . ’
82719	82728	82751	82751	he	1819	‘ He seemed to me an honest man . ’

82757	82761	82763	82763	Tom	71	‘ In short , ’
82774	82875	82767	82767	he	71	‘ if you come to that , perhaps I was so far from being altogether in his favour , that I took him outside the door to tell him quietly , that I thought he might consider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he had got from my sister , and that I hoped he would make good use of it . You remember whether I took him out or not . I say nothing against the man ; he may be a very good fellow , for anything I know ; I hope he is . ’
82876	82885	82771	82771	his	71	‘ Was he offended by what you said ? ’
82886	82906	82907	82907	He	1820	‘ No , he took it pretty well ; he was civil enough . Where are you , Loo ? ’
82916	82926	82907	82907	He	1820	‘ Good night , my dear , good night . ’
82927	82936	82771	82771	his	71	‘ You have nothing more to tell me ? ’
82937	82955	82771	82771	his	71	‘ No . What should I have ? You would n’t have me tell you a lie ! ’
82956	82989	82907	82907	He	1820	‘ I would n’t have you do that to - night , Tom , of all the nights in your life ; many and much happier as I hope they will be . ’
82990	83027	82771	82771	his	71	‘ Thank you , my dear Loo . I am so tired , that I am sure I wonder I do n’t say anything to get to sleep . Go to bed , go to bed . ’
83548	83556	83558	83559	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ It appears but yesterday , sir , ’
83561	83592	83558	83559	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ that I had the honour of receiving you at the Bank , when you were so good as to wish to be made acquainted with Mr. Bounderby ’s address . ’
83593	83613	83615	83616	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ An occasion , I am sure , not to be forgotten by myself in the course of Ages , ’
83633	83643	83645	83646	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ We live in a singular world , sir , ’
83648	83680	83645	83646	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ I have had the honour , by a coincidence of which I am proud , to have made a remark , similar in effect , though not so epigrammatically expressed . ’
83681	83692	83694	83695	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ A singular world , I would say , sir , ’
83725	83771	83705	83705	her	126	‘ as regards the intimacies we form at one time , with individuals we were quite ignorant of , at another . I recall , sir , that on that occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of Miss Gradgrind . ’
83772	83842	83843	83843	He	1839	‘ Your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves . I availed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity , and it is unnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate . Mrs. Sparsit ’s talent for — in fact for anything requiring accuracy — with a combination of strength of mind — and Family — is too habitually developed to admit of any question . ’
83874	83903	83905	83906	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ You found Miss Gradgrind — I really can not call her Mrs. Bounderby ; it ’s very absurd of me — as youthful as I described her ? ’
83910	83917	83919	83920	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ You drew her portrait perfectly , ’
83922	83928	83919	83920	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ Presented her dead image . ’
83929	83935	83937	83938	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Very engaging , sir , ’
83950	83954	83941	83941	her	126	‘ Highly so . ’
83955	83962	83964	83965	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ It used to be considered , ’
83967	84000	83964	83965	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation , but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect . Ay , and indeed here is Mr. Bounderby ! ’
84026	84046	84015	84015	she	126	‘ How do you find yourself this morning , sir ? Pray let us see you cheerful , sir . ’
84107	84131	84098	84099	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ You want your breakfast , sir , but I dare say Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table , ’
84136	84175	84132	84133	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ If I waited to be taken care of by my wife , ma’am , I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday , so I ’ll trouble you to take charge of the teapot . ’
84356	84366	84368	84369	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ There ! Stop where you are , ma’am , ’
84371	84393	84368	84369	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ stop where you are ! Mrs. Bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble , I believe . ’
84394	84402	84404	84405	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Do n’t say that , sir , ’
84411	84433	84404	84405	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ because that is very unkind to Mrs. Bounderby . And to be unkind is not to be you , sir . ’
84434	84459	84461	84462	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ You may set your mind at rest , ma’am . — You can take it very quietly , ca n’t you , Loo ? ’
84472	84492	84461	84462	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ Of course . It is of no moment . Why should it be of any importance to me ? ’
84493	84510	84512	84513	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ Why should it be of any importance to any one , Mrs. Sparsit , ma’am ? ’
84522	84566	84512	84513	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ You attach too much importance to these things , ma’am . By George , you ’ll be corrupted in some of your notions here . You are old - fashioned , ma’am . You are behind Tom Gradgrind ’s children ’s time . ’
84567	84575	84577	84577	Louisa	92	‘ What is the matter with you ? ’
84582	84589	84461	84462	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ What has given you offence ? ’
84590	84593	84595	84595	Bounderby	155	‘ Offence ! ’
84597	84642	84595	84595	Bounderby	155	‘ Do you suppose if there was any offence given me , I should n’t name it , and request to have it corrected ? I am a straightforward man , I believe . I do n’t go beating about for side - winds . ’
84643	84661	84662	84662	Louisa	92	‘ I suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident , or too delicate , ’
84667	84695	84662	84662	Louisa	92	‘ I have never made that objection to you , either as a child or as a woman . I do n’t understand what you would have . ’
84696	84699	84701	84702	Mr. Bounderby	93	‘ Have ? ’
84704	84731	84732	84732	She	92	‘ Nothing . Otherwise , do n’t you , Loo Bounderby , know thoroughly well that I , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown , would have it ? ’
84765	84772	84774	84774	Louisa	92	‘ You are incomprehensible this morning , ’
84776	84800	84774	84774	Louisa	92	‘ Pray take no further trouble to explain yourself . I am not curious to know your meaning . What does it matter ? ’
84931	84935	84921	84921	she	92	‘ My benefactor ! ’
85009	85024	84988	84988	her	92	‘ Serve you right , you Noodle , and I am glad of it . ’
85964	85970	85972	85973	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ Well , my dear , ’
85975	86008	85972	85973	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ and I hope you are going on satisfactorily to yourself . It was all your father ’s doing . He set his heart upon it . And he ought to know . ’
86009	86023	85972	85973	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ I want to hear of you , mother ; not of myself . ’
86024	86064	85972	85973	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ You want to hear of me , my dear ? That ’s something new , I am sure , when anybody wants to hear of me . Not at all well , Louisa . Very faint and giddy . ’
86065	86074	85972	85973	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ Are you in pain , dear mother ? ’
86075	86087	86089	86090	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ I think there ’s a pain somewhere in the room , ’
86092	86105	86089	86090	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ but I could n’t positively say that I have got it . ’
86145	86153	86155	86156	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ You very seldom see your sister , ’
86158	86178	86179	86179	She	92	‘ She grows like you . I wish you would look at her . Sissy , bring her here . ’
86214	86223	86193	86193	Louisa	92	‘ Do you see the likeness , Louisa ? ’
86224	86238	86250	86251	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ Yes , mother . I should think her like me . But — ’
86239	86249	86250	86251	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ Eh ! Yes , I always say so , ’
86258	86288	86250	86251	Mrs. Gradgrind	95	‘ And that reminds me . I — I want to speak to you , my dear . Sissy , my good girl , leave us alone a minute . ’
86427	86438	86411	86411	She	92	‘ You were going to speak to me , mother . ’
86439	86471	86411	86411	She	92	‘ Eh ? Yes , to be sure , my dear . You know your father is almost always away now , and therefore I must write to him about it . ’
86472	86486	86411	86411	She	92	‘ About what , mother ? Do n’t be troubled . About what ? ’
86487	86527	86411	86411	She	92	‘ You must remember , my dear , that whenever I have said anything , on any subject , I have never heard the last of it : and consequently , that I have long left off saying anything . ’
86528	86536	86411	86411	She	92	‘ I can hear you , mother . ’
86579	86640	86565	86565	she	1901	‘ You learnt a great deal , Louisa , and so did your brother . Ologies of all kinds from morning to night . If there is any Ology left , of any description , that has not been worn to rags in this house , all I can say is , I hope I shall never hear its name . ’
86641	86657	86411	86411	She	92	‘ I can hear you , mother , when you have strength to go on . ’
86667	86759	86411	86411	She	92	‘ But there is something — not an Ology at all — that your father has missed , or forgotten , Louisa . I do n’t know what it is . I have often sat with Sissy near me , and thought about it . I shall never get its name now . But your father may . It makes me restless . I want to write to him , to find out for God ’s sake , what it is . Give me a pen , give me a pen . ’
87135	87163	87118	87118	he	93	‘ I tell you what , ma’am ; you shall come down here of a Saturday , while the fine weather lasts , and stay till Monday . ’
87180	87187	87166	87167	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ To hear is to obey . ’
87398	87404	87406	87406	she	126	‘ And pray , sir , ’
87408	87455	87406	87406	she	126	‘ if I may venture to ask a question appertaining to any subject on which you show reserve — which is indeed hardy in me , for I well know you have a reason for everything you do — have you received intelligence respecting the robbery ? ’
87456	87487	87542	87542	Bounderby	93	‘ Why , ma’am , no ; not yet . Under the circumstances , I did n’t expect it yet . Rome was n’t built in a day , ma’am . ’
87488	87494	87496	87497	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Very true , sir , ’
87503	87512	87500	87500	her	126	‘ Nor yet in a week , ma’am . ’
87513	87520	87522	87523	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ No , indeed , sir , ’
87532	87540	87542	87542	Bounderby	93	‘ In a similar manner , ma’am , ’
87544	87619	87542	87542	Bounderby	93	‘ I can wait , you know . If Romulus and Remus could wait , Josiah Bounderby can wait . They were better off in their youth than I was , however . They had a she - wolf for a nurse ; I had only a she - wolf for a grandmother . She did n’t give any milk , ma’am ; she gave bruises . She was a regular Alderney at that . ’
87620	87623	87624	87625	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Ah ! ’
87630	87635	87637	87637	Bounderby	97	‘ No , ma’am , ’
87639	87717	87637	87637	Bounderby	97	‘ I have not heard anything more about it . It ’s in hand , though ; and young Tom , who rather sticks to business at present — something new for him ; he had n’t the schooling I had — is helping . My injunction is , Keep it quiet , and let it seem to blow over . Do what you like under the rose , but do n’t give a sign of what you ’re
87725	87763	87798	87798	ma’am	361	’em will combine together and get this fellow who has bolted , out of reach for good . Keep it quiet , and the thieves will grow in confidence by little and little , and we shall have ’em
87765	87766	87798	87798	ma’am	361	’ ‘
87773	87778	87771	87771	sir	2771	’ said Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
87790	87791	87782	87786	The old woman you mentioned	1916	’ ‘
87800	87817	87792	87796	The old woman I mentioned	1918	’ said Bounderby , cutting the matter short , as it was nothing to boast about , ‘
87876	87942	87851	87851	ma’am	361	’ The same evening , Mrs. Sparsit , in her chamber window , resting from her packing operations , looked towards her great staircase and saw Louisa still descending . She sat by Mr. Harthouse , in an alcove in the garden , talking very low ; he stood leaning over her , as they whispered together , and his face almost touched her hair . ‘
87947	88000	88001	88001	You	1921	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , straining her hawk ’s eyes to the utmost . Mrs. Sparsit was too distant to hear a word of their discourse , or even to know that they were speaking softly , otherwise than from the expression of their figures ; but what they said was this : ‘
88009	88010	88006	88007	Mr. Harthouse	167	’ ‘
88015	88016	88017	88017	His	516	’ ‘
88029	88030	88026	88026	he	516	’ ‘
88092	88093	88084	88084	you	888	’ ‘
88108	88109	88112	88112	Louisa	92	’ ‘
88118	88125	88115	88115	Tom	71	’ Which he never did say . ‘
88134	88135	88126	88126	You	92	’ ‘
88140	88141	88126	88126	You	92	’ ‘
88149	88150	88126	88126	You	92	’ ‘
88155	88173	88153	88153	I	0	’ she returned , with more of her first manner on her than he had lately seen , ‘
88185	88186	88187	88187	My	0	’ ‘
88444	88445	88446	88446	I	0	’ ‘
88458	88467	88456	88456	me	0	’ returned Louisa , after sitting thoughtful awhile , ‘
88490	88491	88492	88492	I	0	’ ‘
88546	89038	89039	89039	Your	1950	’ They strolled away , among the lanes beginning to be indistinct in the twilight — she leaning on his arm — and she little thought how she was going down , down , down , Mrs. Sparsit ’s staircase . Night and day , Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing . When Louisa had arrived at the bottom and disappeared in the gulf , it might fall in upon her if it would ; but , until then , there it was to be , a Building , before Mrs. Sparsit ’s eyes . And there Louisa always was , upon it . And always gliding down , down , down ! Mrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go ; she heard of him here and there ; she saw the changes of the face he had studied ; she , too , remarked to a nicety how and when it clouded , how and when it cleared ; she kept her black eyes wide open , with no touch of pity , with no touch of compunction , all absorbed in interest . In the interest of seeing her , ever drawing , with no hand to stay her , nearer and nearer to the bottom of this new Giant ’s Staircase . With all her deference for Mr. Bounderby as contradistinguished from his portrait , Mrs. Sparsit had not the smallest intention of interrupting the descent . Eager to see it accomplished , and yet patient , she waited for the last fall , as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her hopes . Hushed in expectancy , she kept her wary gaze upon the stairs ; and seldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten ( with her fist in it ) , at the figure coming down . The figure descended the great stairs , steadily , steadily ; always verging , like a weight in deep water , to the black gulf at the bottom . Mr. Gradgrind , apprised of his wife ’s decease , made an expedition from London , and buried her in a business - like manner . He then returned with promptitude to the national cinder - heap , and resumed his sifting for the odds and ends he wanted , and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes of other people who wanted other odds and ends — in fact resumed his parliamentary duties . In the meantime , Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward . Separated from her staircase , all the week , by the length of iron road dividing Coketown from the country house , she yet maintained her cat - like observation of Louisa , through her husband , through her brother , through James Harthouse , through the outsides of letters and packets , through everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs . ‘
89049	89067	89039	89039	Your	1950	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , apostrophizing the descending figure , with the aid of her threatening mitten , ‘
89077	89221	89039	89039	Your	1950	’ Art or nature though , the original stock of Louisa ’s character or the graft of circumstances upon it , — her curious reserve did baffle , while it stimulated , one as sagacious as Mrs. Sparsit . There were times when Mr. James Harthouse was not sure of her . There were times when he could not read the face he had studied so long ; and when this lonely girl was a greater mystery to him , than any woman of the world with a ring of satellites to help her . So the time went on ; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was called away from home by business which required his presence elsewhere , for three or four days . It was on a Friday that he intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit at the Bank , adding : ‘
89256	89257	89231	89231	ma’am	361	’ ‘
89262	89269	89271	89271	me	0	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , reproachfully , ‘
89299	89300	89292	89292	I	0	’ ‘
89319	89327	89328	89329	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ said Mr. Bounderby , not displeased . ‘
89331	89336	89328	89329	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ retorted Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
89404	89405	89396	89396	I	0	’ ‘
89418	89426	89409	89409	I	0	’ said Bounderby , opening his eyes , ‘
89436	89437	89409	89409	I	0	’ ‘
89444	89449	89442	89442	sir	2771	’ returned Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
89473	89474	89469	89469	you	2771	’ ‘
89482	89486	89487	89487	Sir	2771	’ blustered Bounderby . ‘
89489	89494	89487	89487	Sir	2771	’ rejoined Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
89515	89568	89569	89569	Bitzer	77	’ Mr. Bounderby , under the influence of this difficult adjuration , backed up by her compassionate eye , could only scratch his head in a feeble and ridiculous manner , and afterwards assert himself at a distance , by being heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning . ‘
89571	89593	89569	89569	Bitzer	77	’ said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon , when her patron was gone on his journey , and the Bank was closing , ‘
89627	89651	89652	89653	Mr. Thomas	71	’ Young Mr. Thomas being usually ready for anything in that way , returned a gracious answer , and followed on its heels . ‘
89655	89660	89652	89653	Mr. Thomas	71	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
89675	89676	89668	89668	I	0	’ ‘
89682	89692	89679	89680	Mrs. Sparsit	126	’ said the whelp . And gloomily fell to . ‘
89701	89706	89698	89699	Mr. Tom	71	’ asked Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
89714	89718	89698	89699	Mr. Tom	71	’ said Tom . ‘
89726	89749	89750	89750	He	167	’ Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light conversational manner , after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative . ‘
89756	89760	89750	89750	He	167	’ said Tom . ‘
89774	89775	89776	89779	The kind of gentleman	1968	’ ‘
89783	89790	89776	89779	The kind of gentleman	1968	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , sweetly , ‘
89801	89802	89803	89803	Crack	204	’ ‘
89805	89860	89803	89803	Crack	204	’ said Tom . He had long been a down - looking young fellow , but this characteristic had so increased of late , that he never raised his eyes to any face for three seconds together . Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching his looks , if she were so inclined . ‘
89870	89875	89878	89878	he	167	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
89896	89897	89893	89894	Mr. Tom	71	’ ‘
89909	89914	89900	89900	I	0	’ returned the whelp . ‘
89918	89925	89926	89926	I	0	’ cried Mrs. Sparsit , blandly . ‘
89944	89948	89926	89926	I	0	’ said Tom , ‘
90008	90009	89995	89995	he	167	’ ‘
90014	90019	89995	89995	he	167	’ said Mrs. Sparsit . ‘
90041	90042	90033	90033	I	0	’ ‘
90049	90055	90045	90045	I	0	’ returned the reluctant whelp , ‘
90064	90065	90069	90069	my	0	’ ‘
90073	90078	90069	90069	my	0	’ said Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
90107	90108	90145	90145	she	101	’ ‘
90116	90120	90145	90145	she	101	’ observed Tom , ‘
90149	90179	90145	90145	she	101	’ Having paid for his entertainment with this agreeable compliment , he relapsed into a hangdog silence until there was no more India ale left , when he said , ‘
90190	90306	90182	90183	Mrs. Sparsit	126	’ and went off . Next day , Saturday , Mrs. Sparsit sat at her window all day long looking at the customers coming in and out , watching the postmen , keeping an eye on the general traffic of the street , revolving many things in her mind , but , above all , keeping her attention on her staircase . The evening come , she put on her bonnet and shawl , and went quietly out : having her reasons for hovering in a furtive way about the station by which a passenger would arrive from Yorkshire , and for preferring to peep into it round pillars and corners , and out of ladies ’
90440	90453	90455	90456	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ This is a device to keep him out of the way , ’
90471	90479	90465	90465	she	126	‘ Harthouse is with his sister now ! ’
91089	91094	91096	91096	he	1998	‘ My dearest love , ’
91098	91118	91096	91096	he	1998	‘ what could I do ? Knowing you were alone , was it possible that I could stay away ? ’
91119	91148	91150	91151	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ You may hang your head , to make yourself the more attractive ; I do n’t know what they see in you when you hold it up , ’
91153	91169	91150	91151	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ but you little think , my dearest love , whose eyes are on you ! ’
91258	91263	91265	91265	Harthouse	167	‘ My dear child , ’
91278	91291	91273	91273	his	167	‘ will you not bear with my society for a little while ? ’
91292	91296	91267	91268	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Not here . ’
91297	91302	91273	91273	his	167	‘ Where , Louisa ? ‘
91306	91307	91267	91268	Mrs. Sparsit	126	’ ‘
91380	91381	91383	91383	I	0	’ ‘
91397	91398	91383	91383	I	0	’ ‘
91413	91451	91453	91453	I	0	’ They both started . The listener started , guiltily , too ; for she thought there was another listener among the trees . It was only rain , beginning to fall fast , in heavy drops . ‘
91480	91481	91453	91453	I	0	’ ‘
91484	91485	91453	91453	I	0	’ ‘
91566	91898	91901	91903	my dearest love	4465	’ Mrs. Sparsit saw him detain her with his encircling arm , and heard him then and there , within her ( Mrs. Sparsit ’s ) greedy hearing , tell her how he loved her , and how she was the stake for which he ardently desired to play away all that he had in life . The objects he had lately pursued , turned worthless beside her ; such success as was almost in his grasp , he flung away from him like the dirt it was , compared with her . Its pursuit , nevertheless , if it kept him near her , or its renunciation if it took him from her , or flight if she shared it , or secrecy if she commanded it , or any fate , or every fate , all was alike to him , so that she was true to him , — the man who had seen how cast away she was , whom she had inspired at their first meeting with an admiration , an interest , of which he had thought himself incapable , whom she had received into her confidence , who was devoted to her and adored her . All this , and more , in his hurry , and in hers , in the whirl of her own gratified malice , in the dread of being discovered , in the rapidly increasing noise of heavy rain among the leaves , and a thunderstorm rolling up — Mrs. Sparsit received into her mind , set off with such an unavoidable halo of confusion and indistinctness , that when at length he climbed the fence and led his horse away , she was not sure where they were to meet , or when , except that they had said it was to be that night . But one of them yet remained in the darkness before her ; and while she tracked that one she must be right . ‘
91905	91910	91901	91903	my dearest love	4465	’ thought Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
91920	92476	92477	92477	She	2018	’ Mrs. Sparsit saw her out of the wood , and saw her enter the house . What to do next ? It rained now , in a sheet of water . Mrs. Sparsit ’s white stockings were of many colours , green predominating ; prickly things were in her shoes ; caterpillars slung themselves , in hammocks of their own making , from various parts of her dress ; rills ran from her bonnet , and her Roman nose . In such condition , Mrs. Sparsit stood hidden in the density of the shrubbery , considering what next ? Lo , Louisa coming out of the house ! Hastily cloaked and muffled , and stealing away . She elopes ! She falls from the lowermost stair , and is swallowed up in the gulf . Indifferent to the rain , and moving with a quick determined step , she struck into a side - path parallel with the ride . Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the trees , at but a short distance ; for it was not easy to keep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness . When she stopped to close the side - gate without noise , Mrs. Sparsit stopped . When she went on , Mrs. Sparsit went on . She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come , emerged from the green lane , crossed the stony road , and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad . A train for Coketown would come through presently , Mrs. Sparsit knew ; so she understood Coketown to be her first place of destination . In Mrs. Sparsit ’s limp and streaming state , no extensive precautions were necessary to change her usual appearance ; but , she stopped under the lee of the station wall , tumbled her shawl into a new shape , and put it on over her bonnet . So disguised she had no fear of being recognized when she followed up the railroad steps , and paid her money in the small office . Louisa sat waiting in a corner . Mrs. Sparsit sat waiting in another corner . Both listened to the thunder , which was loud , and to the rain , as it washed off the roof , and pattered on the parapets of the arches . Two or three lamps were rained out and blown out ; so , both saw the lightning to advantage as it quivered and zigzagged on the iron tracks . The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling , gradually deepening to a complaint of the heart , announced the train . Fire and steam , and smoke , and red light ; a hiss , a crash , a bell , and a shriek ; Louisa put into one carriage , Mrs. Sparsit put into another : the little station a desert speck in the thunderstorm . Though her teeth chattered in her head from wet and cold , Mrs. Sparsit exulted hugely . The figure had plunged down the precipice , and she felt herself , as it were , attending on the body . Could she , who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph , do less than exult ? ‘
92486	92491	92477	92477	She	2018	’ thought Mrs. Sparsit , ‘
92520	92576	92577	92577	She	2018	’ The tremendous rain occasioned infinite confusion , when the train stopped at its destination . Gutters and pipes had burst , drains had overflowed , and streets were under water . In the first instant of alighting , Mrs. Sparsit turned her distracted eyes towards the waiting coaches , which were in great request . ‘
92583	92587	92577	92577	She	2018	’ she considered , ‘
92622	92802	92803	92803	I	0	’ But , Mrs. Sparsit was wrong in her calculation . Louisa got into no coach , and was already gone . The black eyes kept upon the railroad - carriage in which she had travelled , settled upon it a moment too late . The door not being opened after several minutes , Mrs. Sparsit passed it and repassed it , saw nothing , looked in , and found it empty . Wet through and through : with her feet squelching and squashing in her shoes whenever she moved ; with a rash of rain upon her classical visage ; with a bonnet like an over - ripe fig ; with all her clothes spoiled ; with damp impressions of every button , string , and hook - and - eye she wore , printed off upon her highly connected back ; with a stagnant verdure on her general exterior , such as accumulates on an old park fence in a mouldy lane ; Mrs. Sparsit had no resource but to burst into tears of bitterness and say , ‘
92808	92982	92983	92983	Louisa	92	’ The national dustmen , after entertaining one another with a great many noisy little fights among themselves , had dispersed for the present , and Mr. Gradgrind was at home for the vacation . He sat writing in the room with the deadly statistical clock , proving something no doubt — probably , in the main , that the Good Samaritan was a Bad Economist . The noise of the rain did not disturb him much ; but it attracted his attention sufficiently to make him raise his head sometimes , as if he were rather remonstrating with the elements . When it thundered very loudly , he glanced towards Coketown , having it in his mind that some of the tall chimneys might be struck by lightning . The thunder was rolling into distance , and the rain was pouring down like a deluge , when the door of his room opened . He looked round the lamp upon his table , and saw , with amazement , his eldest daughter . ‘
92985	92986	92983	92983	Louisa	92	’ ‘
92996	92997	92989	92989	I	0	’ ‘
93012	93022	92989	92989	I	0	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , wondering more and more , ‘
93032	93047	92989	92989	I	0	’ She put her hands to her dress , as if she hardly knew . ‘
93050	93091	92989	92989	I	0	’ Then she uncovered her head , and letting her cloak and hood fall where they might , stood looking at him : so colourless , so dishevelled , so defiant and despairing , that he was afraid of her . ‘
93109	93127	93100	93100	Louisa	92	’ She dropped into a chair before him , and put her cold hand on his arm . ‘
93138	93139	93142	93142	Louisa	92	’ ‘
93144	93145	93142	93142	Louisa	92	’ ‘
93160	93173	93146	93146	I	0	’ He looked at her in doubt and dread , vacantly repeating : ‘
93182	93183	93146	93146	I	0	’ ‘
93253	93265	93235	93235	you	108	’ She struck herself with both her hands upon her bosom . ‘
93312	93333	93336	93336	Louisa	92	’ He had been so wholly unprepared for what he heard now , that it was with difficulty he answered , ‘
93338	93339	93336	93336	Louisa	92	’ ‘
93424	93445	93446	93446	Father	108	’ On hearing this , after all his care , he bowed his head upon his hand and groaned aloud . ‘
93553	93557	93537	93537	you	108	’ He said , ‘
93566	93567	93537	93537	you	108	’ ‘
93672	93673	93681	93681	Louisa	92	’ ‘
93683	93684	93681	93681	Louisa	92	’ ‘
93779	93817	93773	93773	I	0	’ He moved , to support her with his arm . She rising as he did so , they stood close together : she , with a hand upon his shoulder , looking fixedly in his face . ‘
93869	93870	93871	93871	I	0	’ ‘
93881	93882	93883	93883	Father	2781	’ ‘
93958	93959	93961	93961	you	0	’ ‘
93967	93973	93961	93961	you	0	’ he said with pity . ‘
94138	94169	94091	94091	Tom	71	’ As her father held her in his arms , she put her other hand upon his other shoulder , and still looking fixedly in his face , went on . ‘
94242	94243	94233	94233	his	2052	’ ‘
94246	94268	94244	94244	Louisa	92	’ he said , and said imploringly ; for he well remembered what had passed between them in their former interview . ‘
94289	94290	94282	94282	I	0	’ ‘
94304	94305	94306	94306	I	0	’ ‘
94437	94438	94421	94421	his	2055	’ ‘
94444	94477	94478	94478	I	0	’ Her father might instinctively have loosened his hold , but that he felt her strength departing from her , and saw a wild dilating fire in the eyes steadfastly regarding him . ‘
94523	94541	94515	94515	he	2055	’ Her father ’s face was ashy white , and he held her in both his arms . ‘
94588	94643	94583	94583	I	0	’ She took her hands suddenly from his shoulders , and pressed them both upon her side ; while in her face , not like itself — and in her figure , drawn up , resolute to finish by a last effort what she had to say — the feelings long suppressed broke loose . ‘
94747	94771	94733	94733	you	2061	’ He tightened his hold in time to prevent her sinking on the floor , but she cried out in a terrible voice , ‘
94787	94985	94776	94776	you	2061	’ And he laid her down there , and saw the pride of his heart and the triumph of his system , lying , an insensible heap , at his feet . Louisa awoke from a torpor , and her eyes languidly opened on her old bed at home , and her old room . It seemed , at first , as if all that had happened since the days when these objects were familiar to her were the shadows of a dream , but gradually , as the objects became more real to her sight , the events became more real to her mind . She could scarcely move her head for pain and heaviness , her eyes were strained and sore , and she was very weak . A curious passive inattention had such possession of her , that the presence of her little sister in the room did not attract her notice for some time . Even when their eyes had met , and her sister had approached the bed , Louisa lay for minutes looking at her in silence , and suffering her timidly to hold her passive hand , before she asked : ‘
94994	94995	94988	94988	I	0	’ ‘
95001	95002	94999	94999	Louisa	92	’ ‘
95008	95009	94999	94999	Louisa	92	’ ‘
95015	95016	95012	95012	I	0	’ ‘
95023	95024	95019	95019	you	0	’ ‘
95107	95108	95098	95098	I	0	’ ‘
95118	95136	95138	95138	I	0	’ said Louisa , as her young sister — timidly still — bent down to kiss her . ‘
95158	95173	95174	95174	You	0	’ The arm Louisa had begun to twine around her neck , unbent itself . ‘
95182	95194	95174	95174	You	0	’ Then , staying her for a moment , she said , ‘
95213	95214	95197	95197	you	2781	’ ‘
95230	95355	95356	95356	My	0	’ Louisa turned upon her pillow , and heard no more . When her sister had withdrawn , she turned her head back again , and lay with her face towards the door , until it opened and her father entered . He had a jaded anxious look upon him , and his hand , usually steady , trembled in hers . He sat down at the side of the bed , tenderly asking how she was , and dwelling on the necessity of her keeping very quiet after her agitation and exposure to the weather last night . He spoke in a subdued and troubled voice , very different from his usual dictatorial manner ; and was often at a loss for words . ‘
95364	95385	95356	95356	My	0	’ He was so much at a loss at that place , that he stopped altogether . He tried again . ‘
95390	95405	95356	95356	My	0	’ The place was so difficult to get over , that he tried again . ‘
95521	95543	95544	95544	I	0	’ She could give him no comfort herein . She had suffered the wreck of her whole life upon the rock . ‘
95653	95734	95735	95735	I	0	’ He said it earnestly , and to do him justice he had . In gauging fathomless deeps with his little mean excise - rod , and in staggering over the universe with his rusty stiff - legged compasses , he had meant to do great things . Within the limits of his short tether he had tumbled about , annihilating the flowers of existence with greater singleness of purpose than many of the blatant personages whose company he kept . ‘
95776	95789	95790	95790	My	0	’ He took her outstretched hand , and retained it in his . ‘
95871	95942	95864	95864	I	0	’ He might have added more than all , when he saw the face now looking at him . He did add it in effect , perhaps , as he softly moved her scattered hair from her forehead with his hand . Such little actions , slight in another man , were very noticeable in him ; and his daughter received them as if they had been words of contrition . ‘
95945	95966	95864	95864	I	0	’ said Mr. Gradgrind , slowly , and with hesitation , as well as with a wretched sense of happiness , ‘
96084	96152	96153	96154	Some persons	2082	’ She had turned upon her pillow , and lay with her face upon her arm , so that he could not see it . All her wildness and passion had subsided ; but , though softened , she was not in tears . Her father was changed in nothing so much as in the respect that he would have been glad to see her in tears . ‘
96157	96164	96153	96154	Some persons	2082	’ he pursued , still hesitating , ‘
96256	96309	96310	96310	Louisa	92	’ He suggested it very doubtfully , as if he were half unwilling to admit it even now . She made him no answer , lying before him on her bed , still half - dressed , much as he had seen her lying on the floor of his room last night . ‘
96312	96322	96310	96310	Louisa	92	’ and his hand rested on her hair again , ‘
96354	96367	96387	96387	I	0	’ he appeared to come to that word with great reluctance always , ‘
96406	96407	96408	96408	Father	108	’ ‘
96410	96417	96408	96408	Father	108	’ she replied , without stirring , ‘
96466	96467	96456	96456	her	354	’ ‘
96475	96484	96456	96456	her	354	’ he said , in a forlorn manner , ‘
96514	96526	96527	96527	Louisa	92	’ He bent his head , and spoke low to her . ‘
96578	96585	96586	96586	I	0	’ She made him no reply . ‘
96620	96908	96909	96909	I	0	’ He looked upon her once more , lying cast away there ; and without another word went out of the room . He had not been long gone , when she heard a light tread near the door , and knew that some one stood beside her . She did not raise her head . A dull anger that she should be seen in her distress , and that the involuntary look she had so resented should come to this fulfilment , smouldered within her like an unwholesome fire . All closely imprisoned forces rend and destroy . The air that would be healthful to the earth , the water that would enrich it , the heat that would ripen it , tear it when caged up . So in her bosom even now ; the strongest qualities she possessed , long turned upon themselves , became a heap of obduracy , that rose against a friend . It was well that soft touch came upon her neck , and that she understood herself to be supposed to have fallen asleep . The sympathetic hand did not claim her resentment . Let it lie there , let it lie . It lay there , warming into life a crowd of gentler thoughts ; and she rested . As she softened with the quiet , and the consciousness of being so watched , some tears made their way into her eyes . The face touched hers , and she knew that there were tears upon it too , and she the cause of them . As Louisa feigned to rouse herself , and sat up , Sissy retired , so that she stood placidly near the bedside . ‘
96931	96932	96923	96923	you	2092	’ ‘
96952	96953	96955	96955	I	0	’ ‘
96957	96965	96955	96955	I	0	’ returned Sissy , shaking her head . ‘
96977	96978	96974	96974	I	0	’ ‘
96981	96988	96990	96990	you	2092	’ said Louisa , almost sternly . ‘
97038	97039	97034	97034	you	2092	’ ‘
97048	97049	97040	97041	My father	4230	’ ‘
97053	97057	97058	97058	He	4230	’ replied Sissy . ‘
97083	97089	97069	97069	he	4230	’ She hesitated and stopped . ‘
97095	97106	97069	97069	he	4230	’ said Louisa , with her searching eyes upon her . ‘
97133	97134	97136	97136	I	0	’ ‘
97143	97144	97136	97136	I	0	’ ‘
97230	97254	97256	97256	I	0	’ Her colour rose as she said it modestly and hurriedly . Louisa understood the loving pretence , and her heart smote her . ‘
97259	97303	97256	97256	I	0	’ said Sissy , emboldened to raise her hand to the neck that was insensibly drooping towards her . Louisa , taking down the hand that would have embraced her in another moment , held it in one of hers , and answered : ‘
97357	97358	97355	97355	you	76	’ ‘
97361	97362	97355	97355	you	76	’ ‘
97448	97449	97400	97400	you	76	’ ‘
97452	97524	97400	97400	you	76	’ In the innocence of her brave affection , and the brimming up of her old devoted spirit , the once deserted girl shone like a beautiful light upon the darkness of the other . Louisa raised the hand that it might clasp her neck and join its fellow there . She fell upon her knees , and clinging to this stroller ’s child looked up at her almost with veneration . ‘
97554	97555	97543	97543	me	0	’ ‘
97561	97565	97543	97543	me	0	’ cried Sissy . ‘
97573	97902	97543	97543	me	0	’ Mr. James Harthouse passed a whole night and a day in a state of so much hurry , that the World , with its best glass in his eye , would scarcely have recognized him during that insane interval , as the brother Jem of the honourable and jocular member . He was positively agitated . He several times spoke with an emphasis , similar to the vulgar manner . He went in and went out in an unaccountable way , like a man without an object . He rode like a highwayman . In a word , he was so horribly bored by existing circumstances , that he forgot to go in for boredom in the manner prescribed by the authorities . After putting his horse at Coketown through the storm , as if it were a leap , he waited up all night : from time to time ringing his bell with the greatest fury , charging the porter who kept watch with delinquency in withholding letters or messages that could not fail to have been entrusted to him , and demanding restitution on the spot . The dawn coming , the morning coming , and the day coming , and neither message nor letter coming with either , he went down to the country house . There , the report was , Mr. Bounderby away , and Mrs. Bounderby in town . Left for town suddenly last evening . Not even known to be gone until receipt of message , importing that her return was not to be expected for the present . In these circumstances he had nothing for it but to follow her to town . He went to the house in town . Mrs. Bounderby not there . He looked in at the Bank . Mr. Bounderby away and Mrs. Sparsit away . Mrs. Sparsit away ? Who could have been reduced to sudden extremity for the company of that griffin ! ‘
97910	97925	97926	97926	She	2101	’ said Tom , who had his own reasons for being uneasy about it . ‘
97964	97965	97953	97953	he	2102	’ ‘
97974	97975	97972	97972	Tom	71	’ ‘
97982	97986	97978	97978	I	0	’ said Tom . ‘
98027	98028	98022	98022	you	71	’ ‘
98037	98038	98029	98029	I	0	’ ‘
98041	98045	98046	98048	Two of us	2104	’ murmured Tom . ‘
98104	98105	98094	98094	I	0	’ ‘
98108	98109	98094	98094	I	0	’ ‘
98122	98123	98125	98125	you	71	’ ‘
98130	98131	98125	98125	you	71	’ ‘
98136	98142	98133	98134	the deuce	2111	’ returned Tom , staring , ‘
98155	98309	98133	98134	the deuce	2111	’ Cursing these quick retorts of the young gentleman to whom he was so true a friend , Mr. Harthouse disembarrassed himself of that interview with the smallest conceivable amount of ceremony , and debated for the hundredth time what all this could mean ? He made only one thing clear . It was , that whether she was in town or out of town , whether he had been premature with her who was so hard to comprehend , or she had lost courage , or they were discovered , or some mischance or mistake , at present incomprehensible , had occurred , he must remain to confront his fortune , whatever it was . The hotel where he was known to live when condemned to that region of blackness , was the stake to which he was tied . As to all the rest — What will be , will be . ‘
98362	98368	98358	98358	I	0	’ said Mr. James Harthouse . ‘
98402	98418	98369	98369	Bounderby	155	’ Therefore he rang the bell , and tossing himself negligently on a sofa , ordered ‘
98430	98510	98369	98369	Bounderby	155	’ and got through the intervening time as well as he could . That was not particularly well ; for he remained in the greatest perplexity , and , as the hours went on , and no kind of explanation offered itself , his perplexity augmented at compound interest . However , he took affairs as coolly as it was in human nature to do , and entertained himself with the facetious idea of the training more than once . ‘
98517	98524	98369	98369	Bounderby	155	’ he yawned at one time , ‘
98536	98545	98547	98554	a fellow of about thirteen or fourteen stone	2116	’ At another time it occurred to him , ‘
98562	98671	98547	98554	a fellow of about thirteen or fourteen stone	2116	’ But these jests did not tell materially on the afternoon , or his suspense ; and , sooth to say , they both lagged fearfully . It was impossible , even before dinner , to avoid often walking about in the pattern of the carpet , looking out of the window , listening at the door for footsteps , and occasionally becoming rather hot when any steps approached that room . But , after dinner , when the day turned to twilight , and the twilight turned to night , and still no communication was made to him , it began to be as he expressed it , ‘
98680	98748	98547	98554	a fellow of about thirteen or fourteen stone	2116	’ However , still true to his conviction that indifference was the genuine high - breeding ( the only conviction he had ) , he seized this crisis as the opportunity for ordering candles and a newspaper . He had been trying in vain , for half an hour , to read this newspaper , when the waiter appeared and said , at once mysteriously and apologetically : ‘
98756	98765	98755	98755	You	2117	’re wanted , sir , if you please . ’
98804	98806	98801	98801	he	167	‘ wanted ’
98808	98826	98801	98801	he	167	‘ Beg your pardon , sir . Young lady outside , sir , wishes to see you . ’
98827	98832	98801	98801	he	167	‘ Outside ? Where ? ’
98833	98840	98801	98801	he	167	‘ Outside this door , sir . ’
98974	98981	98982	98982	she	2126	‘ I speak to Mr. Harthouse ? ’
98990	98995	98996	98996	He	167	‘ To Mr. Harthouse . ’
99002	99031	98996	98996	He	167	‘ And you speak to him with the most confiding eyes I ever saw , and the most earnest voice ( though so quiet ) I ever heard . ’
99032	99045	99048	99048	Sissy	76	‘ If I do not understand — and I do not , sir ’
99050	99065	99048	99048	Sissy	76	‘ what your honour as a gentleman binds you to , in other matters : ’
99080	99123	99074	99074	she	2126	‘ I am sure I may rely upon it to keep my visit secret , and to keep secret what I am going to say . I will rely upon it , if you will tell me I may so far trust — ’
99124	99132	99048	99048	Sissy	76	‘ You may , I assure you . ’
99133	99168	99169	99169	He	2131	‘ I am young , as you see ; I am alone , as you see . In coming to you , sir , I have no advice or encouragement beyond my own hope . ’
99172	99179	99181	99181	he	2131	‘ But that is very strong , ’
99195	99212	99191	99191	He	2131	‘ This is a very odd beginning . I do n’t see where we are going . ’
99213	99217	99219	99219	Sissy	76	‘ I think , ’
99221	99232	99219	99219	Sissy	76	‘ you have already guessed whom I left just now ! ’
99233	99261	99191	99191	He	2131	‘ I have been in the greatest concern and uneasiness during the last four - and - twenty hours ( which have appeared as many years ) , ’
99265	99295	99191	99191	He	2131	‘ on a lady ’s account . The hopes I have been encouraged to form that you come from that lady , do not deceive me , I trust . ’
99296	99304	99219	99219	Sissy	76	‘ I left her within an hour . ’
99305	99309	99191	99191	He	2131	‘ At — ! ’
99310	99316	99219	99219	Sissy	76	‘ At her father ’s . ’
99333	99338	99339	99339	he	167	‘ Then I certainly , ’
99342	99351	99339	99339	he	167	‘ do not see where we are going . ’
99352	99405	99406	99407	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ She hurried there last night . She arrived there in great agitation , and was insensible all through the night . I live at her father ’s , and was with her . You may be sure , sir , you will never see her again as long as you live . ’
99543	99596	99540	99540	he	167	‘ So startling an announcement , so confidently made , and by such lips , is really disconcerting in the last degree . May I be permitted to inquire , if you are charged to convey that information to me in those hopeless words , by the lady of whom we speak ? ’
99597	99605	99540	99540	he	167	‘ I have no charge from her . ’
99606	99658	99540	99540	he	167	‘ The drowning man catches at the straw . With no disrespect for your judgment , and with no doubt of your sincerity , excuse my saying that I cling to the belief that there is yet hope that I am not condemned to perpetual exile from that lady ’s presence . ’
99659	99714	99540	99540	he	167	‘ There is not the least hope . The first object of my coming here , sir , is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her again , than there would be if she had died when she came home last night . ’
99715	99742	99540	99540	he	167	‘ Must believe ? But if I ca n’t — or if I should , by infirmity of nature , be obstinate — and wo n’t — ’
99743	99754	99755	99756	James Harthouse	167	‘ It is still true . There is no hope . ’
99798	99807	99808	99808	he	167	‘ Well ! If it should unhappily appear , ’
99811	99853	99808	99808	he	167	‘ after due pains and duty on my part , that I am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment , I shall not become the lady ’s persecutor . But you said you had no commission from her ? ’
99854	99929	99930	99930	He	2136	‘ I have only the commission of my love for her , and her love for me . I have no other trust , than that I have been with her since she came home , and that she has given me her confidence . I have no further trust , than that I know something of her character and her marriage . O Mr. Harthouse , I think you had that trust too ! ’
99973	99983	99984	99984	he	2136	‘ I am not a moral sort of fellow , ’
99987	100156	99984	99984	he	2136	‘ and I never make any pretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow . I am as immoral as need be . At the same time , in bringing any distress upon the lady who is the subject of the present conversation , or in unfortunately compromising her in any way , or in committing myself by any expression of sentiments towards her , not perfectly reconcilable with — in fact with — the domestic hearth ; or in taking any advantage of her father ’s being a machine , or of her brother ’s being a whelp , or of her husband ’s being a bear ; I beg to be allowed to assure you that I have had no particularly evil intentions , but have glided on from one step to another with a smoothness so perfectly diabolical , that I had not the slightest idea the catalogue was half so long until I began to turn it over . Whereas I find , ’
100165	100174	100158	100160	Mr. James Harthouse	167	‘ that it is really in several volumes . ’
100234	100334	100335	100335	he	167	‘ After what has been just now represented to me , in a manner I find it impossible to doubt — I know of hardly any other source from which I could have accepted it so readily — I feel bound to say to you , in whom the confidence you have mentioned has been reposed , that I can not refuse to contemplate the possibility ( however unexpected ) of my seeing the lady no more . I am solely to blame for the thing having come to this — and — and , I can not say , ’
100346	100376	100335	100335	he	167	‘ that I have any sanguine expectation of ever becoming a moral sort of fellow , or that I have any belief in any moral sort of fellow whatever . ’
100391	100395	100396	100396	he	167	‘ You spoke , ’
100408	100426	100396	100396	he	167	‘ of your first object . I may assume that there is a second to be mentioned ? ’
100427	100430	100402	100402	her	76	‘ Yes . ’
100431	100440	100396	100396	he	167	‘ Will you oblige me by confiding it ? ’
100441	100445	100396	100396	he	167	‘ Mr. Harthouse , ’
100484	100614	100616	100616	she	76	‘ the only reparation that remains with you , is to leave here immediately and finally . I am quite sure that you can mitigate in no other way the wrong and harm you have done . I am quite sure that it is the only compensation you have left it in your power to make . I do not say that it is much , or that it is enough ; but it is something , and it is necessary . Therefore , though without any other authority than I have given you , and even without the knowledge of any other person than yourself and myself , I ask you to depart from this place to - night , under an obligation never to return to it . ’
100719	100725	100726	100726	he	167	‘ But do you know , ’
100734	100805	100726	100726	he	167	‘ the extent of what you ask ? You probably are not aware that I am here on a public kind of business , preposterous enough in itself , but which I have gone in for , and sworn by , and am supposed to be devoted to in quite a desperate manner ? You probably are not aware of that , but I assure you it ’s the fact . ’
100818	100822	100824	100825	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ Besides which , ’
100838	100869	100824	100825	Mr. Harthouse	167	‘ it ’s so alarmingly absurd . It would make a man so ridiculous , after going in for these fellows , to back out in such an incomprehensible way . ’
100870	100876	100878	100878	Sissy	76	‘ I am quite sure , ’
100880	100906	100878	100878	Sissy	76	‘ that it is the only reparation in your power , sir . I am quite sure , or I would not have come here . ’
100918	100935	100907	100907	He	167	‘ Upon my soul , I do n’t know what to say . So immensely absurd ! ’
100949	100961	100962	100962	he	167	‘ If I were to do such a very ridiculous thing , ’
100977	100988	100962	100962	he	167	‘ it could only be in the most inviolable confidence . ’
100989	100998	101000	101000	Sissy	76	‘ I will trust to you , sir , ’
101002	101010	101000	101000	Sissy	76	‘ and you will trust to me . ’
101059	101073	101074	101074	he	167	‘ I suppose a man never was placed in a more ridiculous position , ’
101100	101142	101074	101074	he	167	‘ But I see no way out of it . What will be , will be . This will be , I suppose . I must take off myself , I imagine — in short , I engage to do it . ’
101167	101175	101177	101179	Mr. James Harthouse	167	‘ You will permit me to say , ’
101181	101237	101177	101179	Mr. James Harthouse	167	‘ that I doubt if any other ambassador , or ambassadress , could have addressed me with the same success . I must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position , but as being vanquished at all points . Will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy ’s name ? ’
101238	101242	101244	101245	the ambassadress	2141	‘ My name ? ’
101247	101262	101244	101245	the ambassadress	2141	‘ The only name I could possibly care to know , to - night . ’
101263	101267	101177	101179	Mr. James Harthouse	167	‘ Sissy Jupe . ’
101268	101280	101244	101245	the ambassadress	2141	‘ Pardon my curiosity at parting . Related to the family ? ’
101281	101289	101291	101291	Sissy	76	‘ I am only a poor girl , ’
101293	101324	101325	101325	She	76	‘ I was separated from my father — he was only a stroller — and taken pity on by Mr. Gradgrind . I have lived in the house ever since . ’
101329	101338	101340	101342	Mr. James Harthouse	167	‘ It wanted this to complete the defeat , ’
101362	101397	101340	101342	Mr. James Harthouse	167	‘ The defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished . Only a poor girl — only a stroller — only James Harthouse made nothing of — only James Harthouse a Great Pyramid of failure . ’
101464	101470	101459	101459	He	167	‘ Send my fellow here . ’
101471	101478	101457	101457	Jem	167	‘ Gone to bed , sir . ’
101479	101490	101491	101491	He	167	‘ Tell him to get up , and pack up . ’
102001	102007	102009	102009	Bounderby	93	‘ Now , Tom Gradgrind , ’
102025	102053	102009	102009	Bounderby	93	‘ here ’s a lady here — Mrs. Sparsit — you know Mrs. Sparsit — who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb . ’
102054	102061	102063	102064	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ You have missed my letter ! ’
102071	102078	102080	102080	Bounderby	93	‘ Missed your letter , sir ! ’
102082	102115	102080	102080	Bounderby	93	‘ The present time is no time for letters . No man shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown about letters , with his mind in the state it ’s in now . ’
102116	102119	102121	102122	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Bounderby , ’
102131	102150	102121	102122	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ I speak of a very special letter I have written to you , in reference to Louisa . ’
102151	102155	102157	102157	Bounderby	97	‘ Tom Gradgrind , ’
102174	102201	102157	102157	Bounderby	97	‘ I speak of a very special messenger that has come to me , in reference to Louisa . Mrs. Sparsit , ma’am , stand forward ! ’
102252	102263	102265	102265	Bounderby	93	‘ If you ca n’t get it out , ma’am , ’
102267	102334	102265	102265	Bounderby	93	‘ leave me to get it out . This is not a time for a lady , however highly connected , to be totally inaudible , and seemingly swallowing marbles . Tom Gradgrind , Mrs. Sparsit latterly found herself , by accident , in a situation to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious gentleman - friend , Mr. James Harthouse . ’
102335	102338	102340	102341	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Indeed ! ’
102343	102348	102350	102350	Bounderby	93	‘ Ah ! Indeed ! ’
102352	102358	102350	102350	Bounderby	93	‘ And in that conversation — ’
102359	102376	102265	102265	Bounderby	93	‘ It is not necessary to repeat its tenor , Bounderby . I know what passed . ’
102377	102383	102385	102385	Bounderby	93	‘ You do ? Perhaps , ’
102404	102416	102385	102385	Bounderby	93	‘ you know where your daughter is at the present time ! ’
102417	102424	102265	102265	Bounderby	93	‘ Undoubtedly . She is here . ’
102425	102428	102265	102265	Bounderby	93	‘ Here ? ’
102429	102574	102385	102385	Bounderby	93	‘ My dear Bounderby , let me beg you to restrain these loud out - breaks , on all accounts . Louisa is here . The moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak , and whom I deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you , Louisa hurried here , for protection . I myself had not been at home many hours , when I received her — here , in this room . She hurried by the train to town , she ran from town to this house , through a raging storm , and presented herself before me in a state of distraction . Of course , she has remained here ever since . Let me entreat you , for your own sake and for hers , to be more quiet . ’
102612	102658	102600	102604	the niece of Lady Scadgers	2167	‘ Now , ma’am ! We shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer , for going about the country at express pace , with no other luggage than a Cock - and - a - Bull , ma’am ! ’
102659	102662	102664	102665	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Sir , ’
102667	102703	102706	102706	she	2168	‘ my nerves are at present too much shaken , and my health is at present too much impaired , in your service , to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears . ’
102710	102715	102717	102717	Bounderby	93	‘ Well , ma’am , ’
102719	102841	102717	102717	Bounderby	93	‘ without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family , what I have got to add to that , is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge , namely , a coach . And the coach in which we came here being at the door , you ’ll allow me to hand you down to it , and pack you home to the Bank : where the best course for you to pursue , will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear , and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed . ’
102879	102901	102902	102902	he	93	‘ Now , as you showed me in your face , Tom Gradgrind , that you wanted to speak to me , ’
102905	103010	102902	102902	he	93	‘ here I am . But , I am not in a very agreeable state , I tell you plainly : not relishing this business , even as it is , and not considering that I am at any time as dutifully and submissively treated by your daughter , as Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ought to be treated by his wife . You have your opinion , I dare say ; and I have mine , I know . If you mean to say anything to me to - night , that goes against this candid remark , you had better let it alone . ’
103041	103046	103047	103048	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ My dear Bounderby , ’
103053	103061	103063	103063	Bounderby	93	‘ Now , you ’ll excuse me , ’
103065	103168	103063	103063	Bounderby	93	‘ but I do n’t want to be too dear . That , to start with . When I begin to be dear to a man , I generally find that his intention is to come over me . I am not speaking to you politely ; but , as you are aware , I am not polite . If you like politeness , you know where to get it . You have your gentleman - friends , you know , and they ’ll serve you with as much of the article as you want . I do n’t keep it myself . ’
103169	103172	103174	103175	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ Bounderby , ’
103177	103185	103174	103175	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ we are all liable to mistakes — ’
103186	103193	103063	103063	Bounderby	93	‘ I thought you could n’t make ’em
103195	103199	103174	103175	Mr. Gradgrind	71	’ interrupted Bounderby . ‘

103777	103832	103833	103833	You	0	’ The blustrous Bounderby crimsoned and swelled to such an extent on hearing these words , that he seemed to be , and probably was , on the brink of a fit . With his very ears a bright purple shot with crimson , he pent up his indignation , however , and said : ‘

105451	105456	105449	105449	Bounderby	97	’ urged Mr. Gradgrind , ‘

105475	105484	105487	105487	I	0	’ said Bounderby , tossing his hat on : ‘
105560	106242	105545	105545	my	0	’ So Mr. Bounderby went home to his town house to bed . At five minutes past twelve o’clock next day , he directed Mrs. Bounderby ’s property to be carefully packed up and sent to Tom Gradgrind ’s ; advertised his country retreat for sale by private contract ; and resumed a bachelor life . The robbery at the Bank had not languished before , and did not cease to occupy a front place in the attention of the principal of that establishment now . In boastful proof of his promptitude and activity , as a remarkable man , and a self - made man , and a commercial wonder more admirable than Venus , who had risen out of the mud instead of the sea , he liked to show how little his domestic affairs abated his business ardour . Consequently , in the first few weeks of his resumed bachelorhood , he even advanced upon his usual display of bustle , and every day made such a rout in renewing his investigations into the robbery , that the officers who had it in hand almost wished it had never been committed . They were at fault too , and off the scent . Although they had been so quiet since the first outbreak of the matter , that most people really did suppose it to have been abandoned as hopeless , nothing new occurred . No implicated man or woman took untimely courage , or made a self - betraying step . More remarkable yet , Stephen Blackpool could not be heard of , and the mysterious old woman remained a mystery . Things having come to this pass , and showing no latent signs of stirring beyond it , the upshot of Mr. Bounderby ’s investigations was , that he resolved to hazard a bold burst . He drew up a placard , offering Twenty Pounds reward for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool , suspected of complicity in the robbery of Coketown Bank on such a night ; he described the said Stephen Blackpool by dress , complexion , estimated height , and manner , as minutely as he could ; he recited how he had left the town , and in what direction he had been last seen going ; he had the whole printed in great black letters on a staring broadsheet ; and he caused the walls to be posted with it in the dead of night , so that it should strike upon the sight of the whole population at one blow . The factory - bells had need to ring their loudest that morning to disperse the groups of workers who stood in the tardy daybreak , collected round the placards , devouring them with eager eyes . Not the least eager of the eyes assembled , were the eyes of those who could not read . These people , as they listened to the friendly voice that read aloud — there was always some such ready to help them — stared at the characters which meant so much with a vague awe and respect that would have been half ludicrous , if any aspect of public ignorance could ever be otherwise than threatening and full of evil . Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these placards , among turning spindles , rattling looms , and whirling wheels , for hours afterwards ; and when the Hands cleared out again into the streets , there were still as many readers as before . Slackbridge , the delegate , had to address his audience too that night ; and Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the printer , and had brought it in his pocket . Oh , my friends and fellow - countrymen , the down - trodden operatives of Coketown , oh , my fellow - brothers and fellow - workmen and fellow - citizens and fellow - men , what a to - do was there , when Slackbridge unfolded what he called ‘
106247	106267	105545	105545	my	0	’ and held it up to the gaze , and for the execration of the working - man community ! ‘
106803	106821	106941	106942	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ Thus Slackbridge ; gnashing and perspiring after a prodigious sort . A few stern voices called out ‘
106824	106836	106941	106942	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ and a score or two hailed , with assenting cries of ‘
106841	106848	106941	106942	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ the caution from one man , ‘
106862	106929	106941	106942	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ But these were pigmies against an army ; the general assemblage subscribed to the gospel according to Slackbridge , and gave three cheers for him , as he sat demonstratively panting at them . These men and women were yet in the streets , passing quietly to their homes , when Sissy , who had been called away from Louisa some minutes before , returned . ‘
106934	106938	106941	106942	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ asked Louisa . ‘
106944	106953	106941	106942	Mr. Bounderby	93	’ said Sissy , timid of the name , ‘

107084	107095	107081	107082	Mrs. Bounderby	155	’ said her husband , entering with a cool nod , ‘

107180	107193	107170	107170	You	155	’ said Rachael , standing in front of Louisa . Tom coughed . ‘

113208	113274	113275	113275	I	0	’ The bystanders , on and off the dining - room chairs , raised a murmur of sympathy with Mrs. Pegler , and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently placed in a very distressing predicament , when Mr. Bounderby , who had never ceased walking up and down , and had every moment swelled larger and larger , and grown redder and redder , stopped short . ‘
113281	113286	113275	113275	I	0	’ said Mr. Bounderby , ‘
113309	113325	113308	113308	they	2381	’re quite satisfied , perhaps they ’ll be so good as to disperse ; whether they ’re

113452	114315	113417	113417	my	0	’ Although Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms , holding the door open for the company to depart , there was a blustering sheepishness upon him , at once extremely crestfallen and superlatively absurd . Detected as the Bully of humility , who had built his windy reputation upon lies , and in his boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if he had advanced the mean claim ( there is no meaner ) to tack himself on to a pedigree , he cut a most ridiculous figure . With the people filing off at the door he held , who he knew would carry what had passed to the whole town , to be given to the four winds , he could not have looked a Bully more shorn and forlorn , if he had had his ears cropped . Even that unlucky female , Mrs. Sparsit , fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into the Slough of Despond , was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man and self - made Humbug , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown . Rachael and Sissy , leaving Mrs. Pegler to occupy a bed at her son ’s for that night , walked together to the gate of Stone Lodge and there parted . Mr. Gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far , and spoke with much interest of Stephen Blackpool ; for whom he thought this signal failure of the suspicions against Mrs. Pegler was likely to work well . As to the whelp ; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions , he had stuck close to Bounderby . He seemed to feel that as long as Bounderby could make no discovery without his knowledge , he was so far safe . He never visited his sister , and had only seen her once since she went home : that is to say on the night when he still stuck close to Bounderby , as already related . There was one dim unformed fear lingering about his sister ’s mind , to which she never gave utterance , which surrounded the graceless and ungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery . The same dark possibility had presented itself in the same shapeless guise , this very day , to Sissy , when Rachael spoke of some one who would be confounded by Stephen ’s return , having put him out of the way . Louisa had never spoken of harbouring any suspicion of her brother in connexion with the robbery , she and Sissy had held no confidence on the subject , save in that one interchange of looks when the unconscious father rested his gray head on his hand ; but it was understood between them , and they both knew it . This other fear was so awful , that it hovered about each of them like a ghostly shadow ; neither daring to think of its being near herself , far less of its being near the other . And still the forced spirit which the whelp had plucked up , throve with him . If Stephen Blackpool was not the thief , let him show himself . Why did n’t he ? Another night . Another day and night . No Stephen Blackpool . Where was the man , and why did he not come back ? The Sunday was a bright Sunday in autumn , clear and cool , when early in the morning Sissy and Rachael met , to walk in the country . As Coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but on the neighbourhood ’s too — after the manner of those pious persons who do penance for their own sins by putting other people into sackcloth — it was customary for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of pure air , which is not absolutely the most wicked among the vanities of life , to get a few miles away by the railroad , and then begin their walk , or their lounge in the fields . Sissy and Rachael helped themselves out of the smoke by the usual means , and were put down at a station about midway between the town and Mr. Bounderby ’s retreat . Though the green landscape was blotted here and there with heaps of coal , it was green elsewhere , and there were trees to see , and there were larks singing ( though it was Sunday ) , and there were pleasant scents in the air , and all was over - arched by a bright blue sky . In the distance one way , Coketown showed as a black mist ; in another distance hills began to rise ; in a third , there was a faint change in the light of the horizon where it shone upon the far - off sea . Under their feet , the grass was fresh ; beautiful shadows of branches flickered upon it , and speckled it ; hedgerows were luxuriant ; everything was at peace . Engines at pits ’
114509	114541	114543	114543	Sissy	76	‘ It is so still here , Rachael , and the way is so untrodden , that I think we must be the first who have been here all the summer . ’
114571	114606	114607	114607	She	76	‘ And yet I do n’t know . This has not been broken very long . The wood is quite fresh where it gave way . Here are footsteps too . — O Rachael ! ’
114624	114630	114618	114618	Rachael	146	‘ What is the matter ? ’
114631	114646	114647	114647	They	2385	‘ I do n’t know . There is a hat lying in the grass . ’

115035	115069	115014	115014	Sissy	76	‘ Rachael , Stephen may be living . You would n’t leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place , a moment , if you could bring help to him ? ’
115070	115077	115117	115117	him	2399	‘ No , no , no ! ’
115078	115095	115096	115096	She	146	‘ Do n’t stir from here , for his sake ! Let me go and listen . ’
115217	115277	115205	115205	she	146	‘ Rachael , we must lose not a moment . We must go in different directions , seeking aid . You shall go by the way we have come , and I will go forward by the path . Tell any one you see , and every one what has happened . Think of Stephen , think of Stephen ! ’

The star had shown him where to find the God of the poor ; and through humility , and sorrow , and forgiveness , he had gone to his Redeemer ’s rest . Before the ring formed round the Old Hell Shaft was broken , one figure had disappeared from within it . Mr. Bounderby and his shadow had not stood near Louisa , who held her father ’s arm , but in a retired place by themselves . When Mr. Gradgrind was summoned to the couch , Sissy , attentive to all that happened , slipped behind that wicked shadow — a sight in the horror of his face , if there had been eyes there for any sight but one — and whispered in his ear . Without turning his head , he conferred with her a few moments , and vanished . Thus the whelp had gone out of the circle before the people moved . When the father reached home , he sent a message to Mr. Bounderby ’s , desiring his son to come to him directly . The reply was , that Mr. Bounderby having missed him in the crowd , and seeing nothing of him since , had supposed him to be at Stone Lodge . ‘
118848	118852	118846	118846	father	2781	’ said Louisa , ‘
118864	119055	118853	118853	he	2522	’ Mr. Gradgrind turned away , and said no more . In the morning , he went down to the Bank himself as soon as it was opened , and seeing his son ’s place empty ( he had not the courage to look in at first ) went back along the street to meet Mr. Bounderby on his way there . To whom he said that , for reasons he would soon explain , but entreated not then to be asked for , he had found it necessary to employ his son at a distance for a little while . Also , that he was charged with the duty of vindicating Stephen Blackpool ’s memory , and declaring the thief . Mr. Bounderby quite confounded , stood stock - still in the street after his father - in - law had left him , swelling like an immense soap - bubble , without its beauty . Mr. Gradgrind went home , locked himself in his room , and kept it all that day . When Sissy and Louisa tapped at his door , he said , without opening it , ‘
119066	119077	118853	118853	he	2522	’ On their return in the evening , he said , ‘
119088	119205	118853	118853	he	2522	’ He ate nothing all day , and had no candle after dark ; and they heard him walking to and fro late at night . But , in the morning he appeared at breakfast at the usual hour , and took his usual place at the table . Aged and bent he looked , and quite bowed down ; and yet he looked a wiser man , and a better man , than in the days when in this life he wanted nothing — but Facts . Before he left the room , he appointed a time for them to come to him ; and so , with his gray head drooping , went away . ‘

She took Louisa with her ; and they were received by Mr. Sleary in a very little private apartment , with canvas sides , a grass floor , and a wooden ceiling all aslant , on which the box company stamped their approbation , as if they were coming through . ‘

Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy , who were both before him while his sister yet clung to his shoulder , stopped and recoiled . For , there was Bitzer , out of breath , his thin lips parted , his thin nostrils distended , his white eyelashes quivering , his colourless face more colourless than ever , as if he ran himself into a white heat , when other people ran themselves into a glow . There he stood , panting and heaving , as if he had never stopped since the night , now long ago , when he had run them down before . ‘

124075	124097	124099	124100	Mr. Gradgrind	71	‘ What motive — even what motive in reason — can you have for preventing the escape of this wretched youth , ’

I have suspected young Mr. Tom of this bank - robbery from the first . I had had my eye upon him before that time , for I knew his ways . I have kept my observations to myself , but I have made them ; and I have got ample proofs against him now , besides his running away , and besides his own confession , which I was just in time to overhear . I had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning , and following you here . I am going to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown , in order to deliver him over to Mr. Bounderby . Sir , I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom ’s situation . And I wish to have his situation , sir , for it will be a rise to me , and will do me good . ’

124360	124426	124358	124358	Bitzer	77	‘ but I am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self - interest . What you must always appeal to , is a person ’s self - interest .

124458	124528	124456	124456	Bitzer	77	‘ for hinting at the proposal ; but I will not set any sum against it . Knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative , I have gone over the calculations in my mind ; and I find that to compound a felony , even on very high terms indeed , would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the Bank . ’

It was a fine sight , to behold the learned dog barking round it , and Mr. Sleary instructing him , with his one practicable eye , that Bitzer was the object of his particular attentions . Soon after dark they all three got in and started ; the learned dog ( a formidable creature ) already pinning Bitzer with his eye , and sticking close to the wheel on his side , that he might be ready for him in the event of his showing the slightest disposition to alight . The other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense . At eight o’clock in the morning Mr. Sleary and the dog reappeared : both in high spirits . ‘

Likewithe if you wath to thtand a collar for the dog , or a thet of bellth for the horthe , I thould be very glad to take ’em

125930	125983	125922	125922	he	216	‘ Very well , Thquire ; then , if you ’ll only give a Horthe - riding , a bethpeak , whenever you can , you ’ll more than balanthe the account . Now , Thquire , if your daughter will ethcuthe me , I thould like one parting word with you . ’
126010	126027	125993	125994	Mr. Sleary	88	‘ Thquire , — you do n’t need to be told that dogth ith wonderful animalth . ’

126037	126041	126034	126035	Mr. Gradgrind	216	‘ is surprising . ’
126042	126050	125993	125994	Mr. Sleary	88	‘ Whatever you call it — and I ’m

Perthon of the name of Thleary , in the Horthe - Riding way — thtout man — game eye ? ” And whether that dog might n’t have thed , “ Well , I ca n’t thay I know him mythelf , but I know a dog that I think would be likely to be acquainted with him . ” And whether that dog might n’t have thought it over , and thed , “ Thleary , Thleary ! O yeth , to be thure ! A friend of mine menthioned him to me at one time . I can get you hith addreth directly . ” In conthequenth of my being afore the public , and going about tho muth , you thee , there mutht be a number of dogth acquainted with me , Thquire , that I do n’t know ! ’

We wath getting up our Children in the Wood one morning , when there cometh into our Ring , by the thtage door , a dog . He had travelled a long way , he wath in a very bad condithon , he wath lame , and pretty well blind . He went round to our children , one after another , as if he wath a theeking for a child he know’d ; and then he come to me , and throwd hithelf up behind , and thtood on hith two forelegth , weak ath he wath , and then he wagged hith tail and died .

Now , Thquire , I can take my oath , from my knowledge of that dog , that that man wath dead — and buried — afore that dog come back to me . Joth’phine and Childerth and me talked it over a long time , whether I thould write or not . But we agreed , “ No . There’th nothing comfortable to tell ; why unthettle her mind , and make her unhappy ? ” Tho , whether her father bathely detherted her ; or whether he broke hith own heart alone , rather than pull her down along with him ; never will be known , now , Thquire , till — no , not till we know how the dogth findth uth out ! ’
126616	126646	126648	126649	Mr. Gradgrind	216	‘ She keeps the bottle that he sent her for , to this hour ; and she will believe in his affection to the last moment of her life , ’

127386	127391	127327	127328	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Yes , ma’am . ’
127392	127399	127374	127375	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ May I inquire , sir , ’
127405	127419	127374	127375	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ whether I am the unfortunate cause of your having lost your temper ? ’
127420	127431	127433	127433	Bounderby	93	‘ Now , I ’ll tell you what , ma’am , ’
127435	127479	127433	127433	Bounderby	93	‘ I am not come here to be bullied . A female may be highly connected , but she ca n’t be permitted to bother and badger a man in my position , and I am not going to put up with it . ’

127586	127595	127597	127597	Bounderby	93	‘ You had better allow me , ma’am , ’
127610	127674	127597	127597	Bounderby	93	‘ because I can take the opportunity of saying a word to you , before you go . Mrs. Sparsit , ma’am , I rather think you are cramped here , do you know ? It appears to me , that , under my humble roof , there ’s hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in other people ’s affairs . ’
127692	127697	127675	127676	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Really , sir ? ’
127698	127718	127720	127720	Bounderby	93	‘ I have been thinking it over , you see , since the late affairs have happened , ma’am , ’
127722	127731	127720	127720	Bounderby	93	‘ and it appears to my poor judgment — ’

127748	127791	127793	127794	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ do n’t disparage your judgment . Everybody knows how unerring Mr. Bounderby ’s judgment is . Everybody has had proofs of it . It must be the theme of general conversation . Disparage anything in yourself but your judgment , sir , ’

Such an establishment as your relation , Lady Scadgers ’s , now . Do n’t you think you might find some affairs there , ma’am , to interfere with ? ’
127866	127876	127878	127879	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ It never occurred to me before , sir , ’
127881	127894	127878	127879	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ but now you mention it , should think it highly probable . ’
127895	127903	127905	127905	Bounderby	93	‘ Then suppose you try , ma’am , ’
127920	127990	128002	128003	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ You can take your own time for going , ma’am ; but perhaps in the meanwhile , it will be more agreeable to a lady of your powers of mind , to eat her meals by herself , and not to be intruded upon . I really ought to apologise to you — being only Josiah Bounderby of Coketown — for having stood in your light so long . ’
127991	128000	128002	128003	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ Pray do n’t name it , sir , ’
128005	128080	128002	128003	Mrs. Sparsit	126	‘ If that portrait could speak , sir — but it has the advantage over the original of not possessing the power of committing itself and disgusting others , — it would testify , that a long period has elapsed since I first habitually addressed it as the picture of a Noodle . Nothing that a Noodle does , can awaken surprise or indignation ; the proceedings of a Noodle can only inspire contempt . ’
