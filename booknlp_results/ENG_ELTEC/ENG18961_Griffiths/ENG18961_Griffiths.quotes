352	356	349	350	The lady	169	" All right , "
587	595	577	577	he	155	" There ! there ! in there ! "
718	781	782	783	The porter	155	" Here ! it 's your business to do something . No one has any right to be in that compartment now . There may be reasons — traces — things to remove ; never mind what . But get them all out . Be sharp about it ; and lock the door . Remember you will be held responsible to justice . "
931	937	939	942	the tall English general	194	" Deuced awkward for us ! "
967	978	982	983	Silas Collingham	57	" I ca n't see it . In what way ? "
1016	1055	982	983	Silas Collingham	57	" Why , we shall be detained , of course ; arrested , probably — certainly detained . Examined , cross - examined , bully - ragged — I know something of the French police and their ways . "
1056	1068	1070	1071	his brother	195	" If they stop us , I shall write to the Times "
1092	1134	1137	1137	he	195	" By all means , my dear Silas , when you get the chance . That wo n't be just yet , for I tell you we 're in a tight place , and may expect a good deal of worry . "
1181	1195	1196	1196	he	195	" I only hope to goodness they 'll run straight on to Paris , "
1208	1218	1196	1196	he	195	" No ! By jingo , we 're slackening speed—. "
1219	1249	1196	1196	he	195	" Why should n't we ? It 's right the conductor , or chief of the train , or whatever you call him , should know what has happened . "
1250	1286	1196	1196	he	195	" Why , man , ca n't you see ? While the train is travelling express , every one must stay on board it ; if it slows , it is possible to leave it . "
1287	1295	1196	1196	he	195	" Who would want to leave it ? "
1296	1304	1306	1307	the General	203	" Oh , I do n't know , "
1312	1322	1306	1307	the General	203	" Any way , the thing 's done now . "
1372	1378	1379	1379	he	1234	" How did you know ? "
1382	1392	1379	1379	he	1234	" Know ! Know what ? You stopped me . "
1393	1398	1360	1360	he	155	" I did n't . "
1399	1407	1360	1360	he	155	" Who rang the bell , then ? "
1408	1429	1379	1379	he	1234	" I did not . But I 'm glad you 've come . There has been a crime — murder . "
1430	1434	1436	1437	the conductor	1234	" Good Heavens ! "
1506	1514	1515	1515	he	1234	" No one must leave the car , "
1525	1536	1515	1515	he	1234	" Neither now , nor on arrival at the station . "
1552	1597	1599	1599	He	1234	" You will have to arrange it with the authorities in Paris ; they can alone decide . My duty is plain : to detain you , place you under surveillance till then . Afterwards , we will see . Enough , gentlemen and madame "
2319	2347	2348	2349	A fiacre	259	" Crime on train No . 45 . A man murdered in the sleeper . All the passengers held . Please come at once . Most important . "
2425	2432	2434	2435	M. Floçon	58	" The passengers have been detained ? "
2439	2448	2434	2435	M. Floçon	58	" Those in the sleeping - car only — "
2449	2484	2522	2523	the Chief	247	" Tut , tut ! they should have been all kept — at least until you had taken their names and addresses . Who knows what they might not have been able to tell ? "
2512	2520	2522	2523	the Chief	247	" We should never jump to conclusions , "
2526	2544	2522	2523	the Chief	247	" Well , show me the train card — the list of the travellers in the sleeper . "
2545	2554	2434	2435	M. Floçon	58	" It can not be found , sir . "
2555	2595	2434	2435	M. Floçon	58	" Impossible ! Why , it is the porter 's business to deliver it at the end of the journey to his superiors , and under the law — to us . Where is the porter ? In custody ? "
2596	2609	2522	2523	the Chief	247	" Surely , sir , but there is something wrong with him . "
2610	2648	2434	2435	M. Floçon	58	" So I should think ! Nothing of this kind could well occur without his knowledge . If he was doing his duty — unless , of course , he — but let us avoid hasty conjectures . "
2649	2696	2434	2435	M. Floçon	58	" He has also lost the passengers ' tickets , which you know he retains till the end of the journey . After the catastrophe , however , he was unable to lay his hand upon his pocket - book . It contained all his papers . "
2697	2758	2522	2523	the Chief	247	" Worse and worse . There is something behind all this . Take me to him . Stay , can I have a private room close to the other — where the prisoners , those held on suspicion , are ? It will be necessary to hold investigations , take their depositions . M. le Juge will be here directly . "
2853	2864	2866	2867	the Chief	247	" Now . Sharp ! Are you always like this ? "
2888	2901	2902	2902	he	155	" Are you drunk ? are you — Can it be possible ? "
2919	2931	2915	2915	he	155	" What were you doing between Laroche and Paris ? Sleeping ? "
2939	2981	2935	2935	himself	175	" I think I slept . I must have slept . I was very drowsy . I had been up two nights ; but so it is always , and I am not like this generally . I do not understand . "
2982	2985	2986	2987	The Chief	247	" Hah ! "
2992	3002	2986	2987	The Chief	247	" Did you feel this drowsiness before leaving Laroche ? "
3003	3024	2935	2935	himself	175	" No , monsieur , I did not . Certainly not . I was fresh till then — quite fresh . "
3025	3033	3035	3037	the little Chief	278	" Hum ; exactly ; I see ; "
3059	3064	3065	3065	Sniff	63	" Yes , yes . "
3119	3131	3116	3116	his	155	" Exactly . And now , where is your train card ? "
3132	3143	3071	3073	the little man	280	" Pardon , monsieur , I can not find it . "
3144	3165	3166	3167	The porter	155	" That is absurd . Where do you keep it ? Look again — search — I must have it . "
3173	3186	3166	3167	The porter	155	" It is gone , monsieur , and my pocket - book . "
3187	3195	3071	3073	the little man	280	" But your papers , the tickets — "
3196	3210	3071	3073	the little man	280	" Everything was in it , monsieur . I must have dropped it . "
3237	3248	3229	3229	He	280	" You can give me the names of the passengers ? "
3249	3269	3166	3167	The porter	155	" No , monsieur . Not exactly . I can not remember , not enough to distinguish between them . "
3270	3301	3166	3167	The porter	155	" Fichtre ! But this is most devilishly irritating . To think that I have to do with a man so stupid — such an idiot , such an ass ! "
3302	3370	3229	3229	He	280	" At least you know how the berths were occupied , how many in each , and which persons ? Yes ? You can tell me that ? Well , go on . By and by we will have the passengers in , and you can fix their places , after I have ascertained their names . Now , please ! For how many was the car ? "
3371	3390	3166	3167	The porter	155	" Sixteen . There were two compartments of four berths each , and four of two berths each . "
3391	3413	3415	3416	the Chief	247	" Stay , let us make a plan . I will draw it . Here , now , is that right ? "
3435	3463	3415	3416	the Chief	247	" Here we have the six compartments . Now take a , with berths 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 . Were they all occupied ? "
3464	3503	3166	3167	The porter	155	" No ; only two , by Englishmen . I know that they talked English , which I understand a little . One was a soldier ; the other , I think , a clergyman , or priest . "
3504	3527	3166	3167	The porter	155	" Good ! we can verify that directly . Now , b , with berths 5 and 6 . Who was there ? "
3528	3547	3166	3167	The porter	155	" One gentleman . I do n't remember his name . But I shall know him by appearance . "
3548	3562	3166	3167	The porter	155	" Go on . In c , two berths , 7 and 8 ? "
3563	3583	3166	3167	The porter	155	" Also one gentleman . It was he who — I mean , that is where the crime occurred . "
3584	3605	3166	3167	The porter	155	" Ah , indeed , in 7 and 8 ? Very well . And the next , 9 and 10 ? "
3606	3619	3166	3167	The porter	155	" A lady . Our only lady . She came from Rome . "
3620	3638	3166	3167	The porter	155	" One moment . Where did the rest come from ? Did any embark on the road ? "
3639	3652	3166	3167	The porter	155	" No , monsieur ; all the passengers travelled through from Rome . "
3653	3663	3166	3167	The porter	155	" The dead man included ? Was he Roman ? "
3664	3679	3166	3167	The porter	155	" That I can not say , but he came on board at Rome . "
3680	3691	3166	3167	The porter	155	" Very well . This lady — she was alone ? "
3692	3703	3166	3167	The porter	155	" In the compartment , yes . But not altogether . "
3704	3710	3166	3167	The porter	155	" I do not understand ! "
3711	3719	3166	3167	The porter	155	" She had her servant with her . "
3720	3725	3166	3167	The porter	155	" In the car ? "
3726	3753	3166	3167	The porter	155	" No , not in the car . As a passenger by second class . But she came to her mistress sometimes , in the car . "
3754	3762	3166	3167	The porter	155	" For her service , I presume ? "
3763	3798	3166	3167	The porter	155	" Well , yes , monsieur , when I would permit it . But she came a little too often , and I was compelled to protest , to speak to Madame la Comtesse — "
3799	3807	3166	3167	The porter	155	" She was a countess , then ? "
3808	3827	3166	3167	The porter	155	" The maid addressed her by that title . That is all I know . I heard her . "
3828	3839	3166	3167	The porter	155	" When did you see the lady 's maid last ? "
3840	3852	3166	3167	The porter	155	" Last night . I think at Amberieux . about 8 p.m. "
3853	3858	3166	3167	The porter	155	" Not this morning ? "
3859	3871	3166	3167	The porter	155	" No , sir , I am quite sure of that . "
3872	3907	3166	3167	The porter	155	" Not at Laroche ? She did not come on board to stay , for the last stage , when her mistress would be getting up , dressing , and likely to require her ? "
3908	3918	3166	3167	The porter	155	" No ; I should not have permitted it . "
3919	3930	3166	3167	The porter	155	" And where is the maid now , d'you suppose ? "
3943	3964	3965	3965	he	155	" She is surely somewhere near , in or about the station . She would hardly desert her mistress now , "
3973	3983	3965	3965	he	155	" At any rate we can soon settle that . "
4008	4034	3990	3991	his assistants	288	" Step out , Galipaud , and see . No , wait . I am nearly as stupid as this simpleton . Describe this maid . "
4035	4063	4113	4113	he	247	" Tall and slight , dark - eyed , very black hair . Dressed all in black , plain black bonnet . I can not remember more . "
4064	4105	4113	4113	he	247	" Find her , Galipaud — keep your eye on her . We may want her — why , I can not say , as she seems disconnected with the event , but still she ought to be at hand . "
4117	4138	4113	4113	he	247	" Finish , please . You said 9 and 10 was the lady 's . Well , 11 and 12 ? "
4139	4148	4113	4113	he	247	" It was vacant all through the run . "
4149	4158	4113	4113	he	247	" And the last compartment , for four ? "
4159	4187	4113	4113	he	247	" There were two berths , occupied both by Frenchmen , at least so I judged them . They talked French to each other and to me . "
4188	4235	4113	4113	he	247	" Then now we have them all . Stand aside , please , and I will make the passengers come in . We will then determine their places and affix their names from their own admissions . Call them in , Block , one by one . "
4497	4504	4487	4487	he	305	" For the present , yes , "
4530	4542	4487	4487	he	305	" Because I should like to communicate with the British Embassy . "
4543	4549	4551	4552	the detective	317	" You are known there ? "
4572	4618	4551	4552	the detective	317	" I know Lord Dufferin personally ; I was with him in India . Also Colonel Papillon , the military attaché ; we were in the same regiment . If I sent to the Embassy , the latter would , no doubt , come himself . "
4619	4627	4487	4487	he	305	" How do you propose to send ? "
4628	4658	4487	4487	he	305	" That is for you to decide . All I wish is that it should be known that my brother and I are detained under suspicion , and incriminated . "
4659	4691	4551	4552	the detective	317	" Hardly that , Monsieur le General . But it shall be as you wish . We will telephone from here to the post nearest the Embassy to inform his Excellency — "
4692	4705	4487	4487	he	305	" Certainly , Lord Dufferin , and my friend , Colonel Papillon . "
4706	4723	4487	4487	he	305	" Of what has occurred . And now , if you will permit me to proceed ? "
4808	4813	4814	4814	he	318	" If monsieur permits , "
4825	4835	4814	4814	he	318	" I can throw some light on this catastrophe . "
4836	4861	4863	4864	the detective	317	" And how so , pray ? Did you assist ? Were you present ? If so , why wait to speak till now ? "
4883	4906	4863	4864	the detective	317	" I have had no opportunity till now of addressing any one in authority . You are in authority , I presume ? "
4907	4917	4814	4814	he	318	" I am the Chief of the Detective Service . "
4918	4948	4863	4864	the detective	317	" Then , monsieur , remember , please , that I can give some useful information when called upon . Now , indeed , if you will receive it . "
4967	5003	4961	4961	he	58	" We will wait , if you please . When M. le Juge arrives , then , perhaps ; at any rate , at a later stage . That will do now , thank you . "
5126	5136	5138	5139	the detective	317	" That will do , madame , thank you , "
5143	5150	5138	5139	the detective	317	" for the present at least . "
5151	5165	5166	5166	Her	169	" Why , are we likely to be detained ? I trust not . "
5187	5237	5174	5174	Her	169	" Indeed , Madame la Comtesse , it must be so . I regret it infinitely ; but until we have gone further into this , have elicited some facts , arrived at some conclusions — But there , madame , I need not , must not say more . "
5238	5298	5300	5300	she	169	" Oh , monsieur , I was so anxious to continue my journey . Friends are awaiting me in London . I do hope — I most earnestly beg and entreat you to spare me . I am not very strong ; my health is indifferent . Do , sir , be so good as to release me from — "
5495	5502	5503	5503	he	58	" Madame , it is useless , "
5507	5530	5503	5503	he	58	" I do not make the law ; I have only to support it . Every good citizen is bound to that . "
5531	5540	5542	5543	the Countess	340	" I trust I am a good citizen , "
5554	5610	5542	5543	the Countess	340	" Still , I should wish to be let off now . I have suffered greatly , terribly , by this horrible catastrophe . My nerves are quite shattered . It is too cruel . However , I can say no more , except to ask that you will let my maid come to me . "
5624	5653	5611	5612	M. Floçon	58	" I fear , madame , that for the present at least you can not be allowed to communicate with any one , not even with your maid . "
5654	5675	5542	5543	the Countess	340	" But she is not implicated ; she was not in the car . I have not seen her since — "
5676	5679	5681	5682	M. Floçon	58	" Since ? "
5688	5740	5681	5682	M. Floçon	58	" Since last night , at Amberieux , about eight o'clock . She helped me to undress , and saw me to bed . I sent her away then , and said I should not need her till we reached Paris . But I want her now , indeed I do . "
5741	5751	5542	5543	the Countess	340	" She did not come to you at Laroche ? "
5752	5762	5763	5763	she	341	" No . Have I not said so ? The porter,"—here
5780	5828	5763	5763	she	341	table,—"he made difficulties about her being in the car , saying that she came too often , stayed too long , that I must pay for her berth , and so on . I did not see why I should do that ; so she stayed away . "
5829	5836	5763	5763	she	341	" Except from time to time ? "
5837	5840	5763	5763	she	341	" Precisely . "
5841	5850	5763	5763	she	341	" And the last time was at Amberieux ? "
5851	5866	5763	5763	she	341	" As I have told you , and he will tell you the same . "
5867	5877	5878	5879	The Chief	247	" Thank you , madame , that will do . "
6492	6495	6532	6533	Its owner	365	" F.Q. , "
6520	6528	6566	6567	M. Floçon	58	" Francis Quadling , passenger to Paris , "
8168	8171	8173	8174	the Chief	247	" Impossible ! "
8184	8207	8173	8174	the Chief	247	" I have looked , monsieur , inquired everywhere ; the maid has not been seen . She certainly is not here . "
8208	8220	8173	8174	the Chief	247	" Did she go through the barrier with the other passengers ? "
8221	8245	8173	8174	the Chief	247	" No one knows ; no one remembers her ; not even the conductor . But she has gone . That is positive . "
8246	8280	8173	8174	the Chief	247	" Yet it was her duty to be here ; to attend to her service . Her mistress would certainly want her — has asked for her ! Why should she run away ? "
8370	8377	8382	8382	himself	429	" I will try her further , "
8545	8566	8568	8569	the detective	317	" We must press the Countess on this point closely ; I will put it plainly to M. le Juge , "
8651	8659	8661	8663	the instructing judge	446	" I agree with you , sir , "
8665	8685	8661	8663	the instructing judge	446	" we must have in the Countess first , and pursue the line indicated as regards the missing maid . "
8686	8704	8711	8711	his	58	" I will fetch her , then . Stay , what can be going on in there ? "
8776	8788	8764	8765	the Countess	340	" What 's all this ? How dare you , sir ? "
8817	8844	8853	8853	he	203	" Desist — forbear ! You are opposing legal authority ; desist , or I will call in assistance and will have you secured and removed . "
8872	8890	8892	8893	Sir Charles	56	" It is entirely the fault of this ruffian of yours ; he has behaved most brutally , "
8900	8938	8963	8963	he	203	" Let him go , monsieur ; your behaviour is inexcusable . What ! you , a military officer of the highest rank , to assault a sentinel ! For shame ! This is unworthy of you ! "
8939	8949	8963	8963	he	203	" He deserves to be scragged , the beast ! "
9012	9018	9020	9021	Sir Charles	56	" It is just this , "
9030	9079	9020	9021	Sir Charles	56	" that lady there — poor thing , she is ill , you can see that for yourself , suffering , overwrought ; she asked for a glass of water , and this brute , triple brute , as you say in French , refused to bring it . "
9080	9088	9090	9091	the guard	460	" I could not leave the room , "
9093	9099	9090	9091	the guard	460	" My orders were precise . "
9100	9110	9113	9114	the General	203	" So I was going to fetch the water , "
9132	9138	9122	9122	he	203	" and this fellow interfered . "
9139	9143	9145	9146	M. Floçon	58	" Very properly , "
9148	9198	9145	9146	M. Floçon	58	" Then why did n't he go himself , or call some one ? Upon my word , monsieur , you are not to be complimented upon your people , nor your methods . I used to think that a Frenchman was gallant , courteous , especially to ladies . "
9222	9255	9216	9216	he	247	" I am responsible for my conduct to my superiors , and not to you . Besides , you appear to forget your position . You are here , detained — all of you"—he
9260	9276	9216	9216	he	247	room—"under suspicion . A ghastly crime has been perpetrated — by some one among you — "
9277	9286	9288	9290	the irrepressible General	468	" Do not be too sure of that , "
9292	9307	9309	9310	the detective	317	" Who else could be concerned ? The train never stopped after leaving Laroche , "
9320	9326	9328	9329	Sir Charles	56	" Yes , it did , "
9336	9343	9328	9329	Sir Charles	56	" shows how much you know . "
9442	9454	9455	9455	he	247	" What I know or do not know is my affair , "
9466	9490	9491	9491	He	247	" I shall call upon you , M. le Général , for your statement in due course , and that of the others . "
9499	9524	9491	9491	He	247	" Every one must be interrogated . M. le Juge is now here , and he proposes to begin , madame , with you . "
9539	9551	9553	9554	the General	203	" Ca n't you see she is not equal to it ? "
9558	9596	9553	9554	the General	203	" She has not yet recovered . In the name of — I do not say chivalry , for that would be useless — but of common humanity , spare madame , at least for the present . "
9597	9628	9678	9678	he	56	" That is impossible , quite impossible . There are reasons why Madame la Comtesse should be examined first . I trust , therefore , she will make an effort . "
9629	9639	9640	9640	She	340	" I will try , if you wish it . "
9656	9667	9669	9670	Sir Charles	56	" No , no , Countess , do not go , "
9691	9705	9678	9678	he	56	" This is sheer cruelty , sir , and can not be permitted . "
9706	9710	9712	9713	M. Floçon	58	" Stand aside ! "
9715	9741	9712	9713	M. Floçon	58	" I forbid you to approach that lady , to address her , or communicate with her . Guard , advance , do your duty . "
9838	9846	9847	9847	he	203	" This is not to be borne ! "
9850	9857	9847	9847	he	203	" Here , Galipaud , Block ; "
9875	9900	9868	9868	he	203	" Seize him , remove him by force if necessary . He shall go to the violon — to the nearest lock - up . "
9964	9990	9991	9991	he	203	" What , all of you ? How many more ? Why not bring up cavalry and artillery , horse , foot , and guns ? "
9996	10017	9991	9991	he	203	" All to prevent one old man from offering his services to one weak woman ! Gentlemen , my regards ! "
10018	10031	10035	10036	the clergyman	492	" Really , Charles , I fear you are going too far , "
10050	10064	10066	10067	the Countess	340	" Indeed , yes . It is not necessary , I assure you , "
10079	10107	10066	10067	the Countess	340	" I am most touched , most thankful . You are a true soldier , a true English gentleman , and I shall never forget your kindness . "
10159	10265	10147	10147	he	203	" Monsieur will not , I trust , oblige us to put in force the full power of the law . I might , if I chose , and as I am fully entitled , commit you at once to Mazas , to keep you in solitary confinement . Your conduct has been deplorable , well calculated to traverse and impede justice . But I am willing to believe that you were led away , not unnaturally , as a gallant gentleman,—it is the characteristic of your nation , of your cloth,—and that on more mature consideration you will acknowledge and not repeat your error . "
10326	10336	10338	10339	Sir Charles	56	" Oh , with all my heart , monsieur , "
10343	10390	10338	10339	Sir Charles	56	" You saw , or at least know , how this has occurred . I did not begin it , nor was I the most to blame . But I was in the wrong , I admit . What do you wish me to do now ? "
10391	10418	10338	10339	Sir Charles	56	" Give me your promise to abide by our rules,—they may be irksome , but we think them necessary,—and hold no further converse with your companions . "
10419	10438	10338	10339	Sir Charles	56	" Certainly , certainly , monsieur,—at least after I have said one word more to Madame la Comtesse . "
10439	10451	10338	10339	Sir Charles	56	" No , no , I can not permit even that — "
10485	10506	10453	10454	Sir Charles	56	" Courage , dear lady , courage . Do n't let them bully you . You have nothing to fear . "
10665	10681	10683	10685	M. le Hardi	75	" I trust , madame , that you are equal to answering a few questions ? "
10689	10705	10707	10708	the Countess	340	" Oh , yes , I hope so . Indeed , I have no choice , "
10713	10722	10707	10708	the Countess	340	" They will refer principally to your maid . "
10723	10726	10728	10729	the Countess	340	" Ah ! "
10750	10765	10739	10739	she	340	" I want to know a little more about her , if you please . "
10766	10778	10779	10779	She	340	" Of course . Anything I know I will tell you . "
10788	10799	10779	10779	She	340	" But if I might ask — why this interest ? "
10800	10819	10739	10739	she	340	" I will tell you frankly . You asked for her , we sent for her , and — "
10820	10823	10739	10739	she	340	" Yes ? "
10824	10838	10839	10840	The Countess	340	" She can not be found . She is not in the station . "
10860	10882	10848	10848	her	340	" Impossible ! it can not be . She would not dare to leave me here like this , all alone . "
10883	10897	10739	10739	she	340	" Parbleu ! she has dared . Most certainly she is not here . "
10898	10907	10739	10739	she	340	" But what can have become of her ? "
10908	10933	10848	10848	her	340	" Ah , madame , what indeed ? Can you form any idea ? We hoped you might have been able to enlighten us . "
10934	10946	10739	10739	she	340	" I can not , monsieur , not in the least . "
10947	10977	10848	10848	her	340	" Perchance you sent her on to your hotel to warn your friends that you were detained ? To fetch them , perhaps , to you in your trouble ? "
10990	11006	10985	10985	she	518	" How could I ? I knew of no trouble when I saw her last . "
11007	11017	10739	10739	she	340	" Oh , indeed ? and when was that ? "
11018	11033	11034	11034	She	518	" Last night , at Amberieux , as I have already told that gentleman . "
11048	11090	11045	11045	his	58	" Well , she has gone away somewhere . It does not much matter , still it is odd , and for your sake we should like to help you to find her , if you do wish to find her ? "
11097	11111	11045	11045	his	58	" Indeed I hardly think she is worth keeping after this barefaced desertion . "
11112	11144	10739	10739	she	340	" No , indeed . And she must be held to strict account for it , must justify it , give her reasons . So we must find her for you — "
11145	11155	11156	11157	the Countess	340	" I am not at all anxious , really , "
11169	11203	11156	11157	the Countess	340	" Well , now , Madame la Comtesse , as to her description . Will you tell us what was her height , figure , colour of eyes , hair , general appearance ? "
11204	11227	10739	10739	she	340	" She was tall , above the middle height , at least ; slight , good figure , black hair and eyes . "
11228	11231	10739	10739	she	340	" Pretty ? "
11232	11255	11156	11157	the Countess	340	" That depends upon what you mean by ' pretty . ' Some people might think so , in her own class . "
11256	11262	10739	10739	she	340	" How was she dressed ? "
11263	11287	10739	10739	she	340	" In plain dark serge , bonnet of black straw and brown ribbons . I do not allow my maid to wear colours . "
11288	11301	11156	11157	the Countess	340	" Exactly . And her name , age , place of birth ? "
11302	11318	11319	11320	The Judge	485	" Hortense Petitpré , thirty - two , born , I believe , in Paris . "
11376	11481	11367	11367	He	485	" Here is the more detailed description of the lady 's maid , and in writing . Have it copied and circulate it at once . Give it to the station - master , and to the agents of police round about here . I have an idea — only an idea — that this woman has not gone far . It may be worth nothing , still there is the chance . People who are wanted often hang about the very place they would not stay in if they were wise . Anyhow , set a watch for her and come back here . "
11491	11503	11484	11485	the Judge	485	" And where , madame , did you obtain your maid ? "
11504	11541	11367	11367	He	485	" In Rome . She was there , out of a place . I heard of her at an agency and registry office , when I was looking for a maid a month or two ago . "
11542	11553	11484	11485	the Judge	485	" Then she has not been long in your service ? "
11554	11570	11484	11485	the Judge	485	" No ; as I tell you , she came to me in December last . "
11571	11575	11367	11367	He	485	" Well recommended ? "
11576	11590	11484	11485	the Judge	485	" Strongly . She had lived with good families , French and English . "
11591	11601	11484	11485	the Judge	485	" And with you , what was her character ? "
11602	11605	11367	11367	He	485	" Irreproachable . "
11606	11649	11484	11485	the Judge	485	" Well , so much for Hortense Petitpré . She is not far off , I dare say . When we want her we shall be able to lay hands on her , I do not doubt , madame may rest assured . "
11650	11666	11484	11485	the Judge	485	" Pray take no trouble in the matter . I certainly should not keep her . "
11667	11684	11685	11685	he	524	" Very well , very well . And now , another small matter . I see , "
11699	11716	11685	11685	he	524	Floçon,—"I see that you occupied the compartment d , with berths Nos . 9 and 10 ? "
11717	11728	11484	11485	the Judge	485	" I think 9 was the number of my berth . "
11729	11762	11685	11685	he	524	" It was . You may be certain of that . Now next door to your compartment — do you know who was next door ? I mean in 7 and 8 ? "
11785	11792	11778	11778	she	340	" It was where — where — "
11793	11800	11802	11803	the Judge	485	" There , there , madame , "
11814	11834	11808	11808	he	485	" You need not say . It is no doubt very distressing to you . Yet , you know ? "
11846	11894	11835	11835	She	340	" Now this man , this poor man , had you noticed him at all ? No — no — not afterwards , of course . It would not be likely . But during the journey . Did you speak to him , or he to you ? "
11895	11903	11808	11808	he	485	" No , no — distinctly no . "
11904	11909	11808	11808	he	485	" Nor see him ? "
11910	11929	11835	11835	She	340	" Yes , I saw him , I believe , at Modane with the rest when we dined . "
11930	11965	11808	11808	he	485	" Ah ! exactly so . He dined at Modane . Was that the only occasion on which you saw him ? You had never met him previously in Rome , where you resided ? "
11966	11976	11808	11808	he	485	" Whom do you mean ? The murdered man ? "
11977	11981	11835	11835	She	340	" Who else ? "
11982	12003	11808	11808	he	485	" No , not that I am aware of . At least I did not recognize him as a friend . "
12004	12015	11808	11808	he	485	" I presume , if he was among your friends — "
12016	12026	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" Pardon me , that he certainly was not , "
12031	12048	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" Well , among your acquaintances — he would probably have made himself known to you ? "
12049	12054	11808	11808	he	485	" I suppose so . "
12055	12074	11808	11808	he	485	" And he did not do so ? He never spoke to you , nor you to him ? "
12075	12105	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" I never saw him , the occupant of that compartment , except on that one occasion . I kept a good deal in my compartment during the journey . "
12106	12118	12120	12121	the Judge	485	" Alone ? It must have been very dull for you , "
12125	12132	12134	12135	the Countess	340	" I was not always alone , "
12145	12153	12134	12135	the Countess	340	" I had friends in the car . "
12154	12157	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" Oh — oh"—the
12167	12187	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" Who were they ? You may as well tell us , madame , we should certainly find out . "
12188	12198	12199	12199	she	340	" I have no wish to withhold the information , "
12212	12217	12199	12199	she	340	" Why should I ? "
12218	12225	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" And these friends were — ? "
12226	12249	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" Sir Charles Collingham and his brother . They came and sat with me occasionally ; sometimes one , sometimes the other . "
12250	12255	12199	12199	she	340	" During the day ? "
12256	12264	12265	12265	Her	340	" Of course , during the day . "
12277	12284	12265	12265	Her	340	" Have you known them long ? "
12285	12304	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" The General I met in Roman society last winter . It was he who introduced his brother . "
12305	12333	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" Very good , so far . The General knew you , took an interest in you . That explains his strange , unjustifiable conduct just now — "
12334	12346	12348	12349	the Countess	340	" I do not think it was either strange or unjustifiable , "
12353	12359	12348	12349	the Countess	340	" He is a gentleman . "
12360	12387	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" Quite a preux cavalier , of course . But we will pass on . You are not a good sleeper , I believe , madame ? "
12388	12400	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" Indeed no , I sleep badly , as a rule . "
12401	12430	12348	12349	the Countess	340	" Then you would be easily disturbed . Now , last night , did you hear anything strange in the car , more particularly in the adjoining compartment ? "
12431	12434	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" Nothing . "
12435	12452	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" No sound of voices raised high , no noise of a conflict , a struggle ? "
12453	12458	12348	12349	the Countess	340	" No , monsieur . "
12459	12523	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" That is odd . I can not understand it . We know , beyond all question , from the appearance of the body,—the corpse,—that there was a fight , an encounter . Yet you , a wretched sleeper , with only a thin plank of wood between you and the affray , hear nothing , absolutely nothing . It is most extraordinary . "
12524	12535	12028	12029	the Countess	340	" I was asleep . I must have been asleep . "
12536	12556	12348	12349	the Countess	340	" A light sleeper would certainly be awakened . How can you explain — how can you reconcile that ? "
12573	12607	12564	12565	the Judge	485	" Easily : I had taken a soporific . I always do , on a journey . I am obliged to keep something , sulphonal or chloral , by me , on purpose . "
12608	12617	12619	12620	the Judge	485	" Then this , madame , is yours ? "
12667	12690	12651	12652	The Countess	340	" No , I can not give it up . Look as near as you like , and say is it yours ? "
12691	12709	12564	12565	the Judge	485	" Of course it is mine . Where did you get it ? Not in my berth ? "
12710	12720	12564	12565	the Judge	485	" No , madame , not in your berth . "
12721	12725	12651	12652	The Countess	340	" But where ? "
12726	12740	12564	12565	the Judge	485	" Pardon me , we shall not tell you — not just now . "
12741	12748	12751	12752	the Countess	340	" I missed it last night , "
12757	12767	12751	12752	the Countess	340	" After you had taken your dose of chloral ? "
12768	12773	12564	12565	the Judge	485	" No , before . "
12774	12786	12564	12565	the Judge	485	" And why did you want this ? It is laudanum . "
12787	12814	12751	12752	the Countess	340	" For my nerves . I have a toothache . I — I — really , sir , I need not tell you all my ailments . "
12815	12823	12564	12565	the Judge	485	" And the maid had removed it ? "
12824	12843	12564	12565	the Judge	485	" So I presume ; she must have taken it out of the bag in the first instance . "
12844	12850	12751	12752	the Countess	340	" And then kept it ? "
12851	12860	12564	12565	the Judge	485	" That is what I can only suppose . "
12861	12864	12564	12565	the Judge	485	" Ah ! "
12894	12897	12885	12885	he	485	" Ah ! "
12936	12943	12945	12946	the detective	317	" Admirable , M. le Juge ! "
12948	12961	12945	12946	the detective	317	" You have been most adroit . It is a clear case . "
12962	12966	12968	12969	the Commissary	486	" No doubt , "
12997	13014	12973	12978	a blunt , rather coarse person	545	" It looks black against her . I think she ought to be arrested at once . "
13015	13033	13034	13035	The Judge	485	" We might , indeed we ought to have more evidence , more definite evidence , perhaps ? "
13046	13061	13062	13062	he	485	" I should like , before going further , to look at the car , "
13076	13082	13083	13083	he	485	" We will go together , "
13088	13107	13083	13083	he	485	" Madame will remain here , please , until we return . It may not be for long . "
13108	13112	13114	13115	the Countess	340	" And afterwards ? "
13131	13139	13083	13083	he	485	" Ah , afterwards ! Who knows ? "
13157	13164	13166	13167	the Judge	485	" What have we against her ? "
13184	13200	13202	13203	the detective	317	" The bottle of laudanum and the porter 's condition . He was undoubtedly drugged , "
13228	13244	13493	13493	he	555	" Yes ; but why by the Countess ? How do we know that positively ? "
13245	13251	13253	13254	M. Floçon	58	" It is her bottle , "
13256	13274	13253	13254	M. Floçon	58	" Her story may be true — that she missed it , that the maid took it . "
13275	13290	13493	13493	he	555	" We have nothing whatever against the maid . We know nothing about her . "
13291	13325	13493	13493	he	555	" No . Except that she has disappeared . But that tells more against her mistress . It is all very vague . I do not see my way quite , as yet . "
13326	13358	13253	13254	M. Floçon	58	" But the fragment of lace , the broken beading ? Surely , M. le Juge , they are a woman 's , and only one woman was in the car — "
13359	13366	13493	13493	he	555	" So far as we know . "
13367	13378	13493	13493	he	555	" But if these could be proved to be hers ? "
13379	13388	13253	13254	M. Floçon	58	" Ah ! if you could prove that ! "
13389	13417	13493	13493	he	555	" Easy enough . Have her searched , here at once , in the station . There is a female searcher attached to the detention - room . "
13418	13430	13493	13493	he	555	" It is a strong measure . She is a lady . "
13431	13446	13253	13254	M. Floçon	58	" Ladies who commit crimes must not expect to be handled with kid gloves . "
13447	13491	13493	13493	he	555	" She is an Englishwoman , or with English connections ; titled , too . I hesitate , upon my word . Suppose we are wrong ? It may lead to unpleasantness . M. le Prefet is anxious to avoid complications possibly international . "
13521	13546	13496	13496	he	555	" It is fine lace , I think . What say you , M. Floçon ? You may be more experienced in such matters . "
13547	13580	13496	13496	he	555	" The finest , or nearly so ; I believe it is Valenciennes — the trimming of some underclothing , I should think . That surely is sufficient , M. le Juge ? "
13754	13817	13819	13819	she	85	" Aha ! oho ! What is this , my pretty princess ? How comes so great a lady into the hands of Mother Tontaine ? But I will not harm you , my beauty , my pretty , my little one . Oh , no , no , I will not trouble you , dearie . No , trust to me ; "
13841	13846	13864	13864	she	85	" Madame has money ? "
13881	13892	13864	13864	she	85	" If you mean that I am to bribe you — "
13893	13926	13927	13927	She	340	" Fie , the nasty word ! But just a small present , a pretty gift , one or two yellow bits , twenty , thirty , forty francs — you'd better . "
13949	13954	13956	13957	the Countess	340	" Wait , wait ! "
13977	13988	13990	13991	the searcher	569	" Aha ! oho ! One , two , three , "
13999	14008	14010	14010	she	85	" Four , yes , four , five ; "
14033	14087	14010	14010	she	85	" Five — make it five at once , d'ye hear me?—or I 'll call them in and tell them . That will go against you , my princess . What , try to bribe a poor old woman , Mother Tontaine , honest and incorruptible Tontaine ? Five , then , five ! "
14107	14159	14165	14165	she	340	" Bon aubaine . Nice pickings . It is a misery what they pay me here . I am , oh , so poor , and I have children , many babies . You will not tell them — the police — you dare not . No , no , no . "
14202	14237	14183	14183	she	340	" Do you know this , little one ? Where it comes from , where there is much more ? I was told to look for it , to search for it on you ; "
14264	14308	14243	14243	she	340	" Oho ! aha ! You were right , my pretty , to pay me , my pretty — right . And some day , to - day , to - morrow , whenever I ask you , you will remember Mother Tontaine . "
14333	14347	14317	14317	she	340	" And this , my princess ? What have we here , aha ? "
14380	14438	14364	14365	the Countess	340	" You recognize it , of course . But be careful , my pretty ! Beware ! If any one were looking , it would ruin you . I could not save you then . Sh ! say nothing , only look , and quick , give it me back . I must have it to show . "
14503	14510	14587	14589	the old woman	581	" Give it me , quick ! "
14520	14527	14587	14589	the old woman	581	" They are coming . Remember ! "
14538	14567	14531	14531	her	85	" Not a word ! I have found nothing , of course . Nothing , I can swear to that , and you will not forget Mother Tontaine ? "
14734	14741	14743	14744	the Judge	485	" What next , M. Floçon ? "
14746	14754	14743	14744	the Judge	485	" What shall we do with her ? "
14755	14760	14762	14763	the detective	317	" Let her go , "
14767	14777	14779	14780	the Judge	485	" What ! do you suggest this , sir , "
14784	14794	14779	14780	the Judge	485	" After your strong and well - grounded suspicions ? "
14795	14831	14743	14744	the Judge	485	" They are as strong as ever , stronger : and I feel sure I shall yet justify them . But what I wish now is to let her go at large , under surveillance . "
14832	14840	14743	14744	the Judge	485	" Ah ! you would shadow her ? "
14841	14873	14779	14780	the Judge	485	" Precisely . By a good agent . Galipaud , for instance . He speaks English , and he can , if necessary , follow her anywhere , even to England . "
14874	14880	14882	14883	the Commissary	486	" She can be extradited , "
14893	14933	14886	14886	his	486	" Do you agree , M. le Juge ? Then , if you will permit me , I will give the necessary orders , and perhaps you will inform the lady that she is free to leave the station ? "
15394	15401	15403	15404	the Judge	485	" Who and what are you ? "
15433	15455	15430	15431	M. Floçon	58	" My name I have given you — Natale Ripaldi . I am a detective officer belonging to the Roman police . "
15456	15459	15461	15462	M. Floçon	58	" What ! "
15467	15491	15461	15462	M. Floçon	58	" This is unheard of . Why in the name of all the devils have you withheld this most astonishing statement until now ? "
15492	15511	15430	15431	M. Floçon	58	" Monsieur surely remembers . I told him half an hour ago I had something important to communicate — "
15512	15530	15430	15431	M. Floçon	58	" Yes , yes , of course . But why were you so reticent . Good Heavens ! "
15531	15557	15461	15462	M. Floçon	58	" Monsieur was not so encouraging that I felt disposed to force on him what I knew he would have to hear in due course . "
15558	15580	15583	15584	the Chief	247	" It is monstrous — quite abominable , and shall not end here . Your superiors shall hear of your conduct , "
15588	15631	15583	15584	the Chief	247	" They will also hear , and , I think , listen to my version of the story,—that I offered you fairly , and at the first opportunity , all the information I had , and that you refused to accept it . "
15632	15658	15461	15462	M. Floçon	58	" You should have persisted . It was your manifest duty . You are an officer of the law , or you say you are . "
15659	15715	15461	15462	M. Floçon	58	" Pray telegraph at once , if you think fit , to Rome , to the police authorities , and you will find that Natale Ripaldi — your humble servant — travelled by the through express with their knowledge and authority . And here are my credentials , my official card , some official letters — "
15716	15730	15583	15584	the Chief	247	" And what , in a word , have you to tell us ? "
15731	15742	15461	15462	M. Floçon	58	" I can tell you who the murdered man was . "
15743	15749	15461	15462	M. Floçon	58	" We know that already . "
15750	15791	15583	15584	the Chief	247	" Possibly ; but only his name , I apprehend . I know his profession , his business , his object in travelling , for I was appointed to watch and follow him . That is why I am here . "
15792	15804	15461	15462	M. Floçon	58	" Was he a suspicious character , then ? A criminal ? "
15805	15818	15461	15462	M. Floçon	58	" At any rate he was absconding from Rome , with valuables . "
15819	15826	15827	15828	The Italian	324	" A thief , in fact ? "
15844	15868	15827	15828	The Italian	324	" Thief is a hard , ugly word . That which he was removing was , or had been , his own property . "
15869	15882	15884	15886	the little Chief	278	" Tut , tut ! do be more explicit and get on , "
15890	15904	15905	15906	The Judge	485	" I ask nothing better ; but if questions are put to me — "
15909	15921	15905	15906	The Judge	485	" Give us your story . We can interrogate you afterwards . "
15922	16019	16021	16021	his	485	" The murdered man is Francis A. Quadling , of the firm of Correse & Quadling , bankers , in the Via Condotti , Rome . It was an old house , once of good , of the highest repute , but of late years it has fallen into difficulties . Its financial soundness was doubted in certain circles , and the Government was warned that a great scandal was imminent . So the matter was handed over to the police , and I was directed to make inquiries , and to keep my eye on this Quadling"—he
16036	16077	16021	16021	his	485	" This Quadling was the only surviving partner . He was well known and liked in Rome , indeed , many who heard the adverse reports disbelieved them , I myself among the number . But my duty was plain — "
16078	16081	16083	16086	the fiery little detective	624	" Naturally , "
16088	16172	16083	16086	the fiery little detective	624	" I made it my business to place the banker under surveillance , to learn his habits , his ways of life , see who were his friends , the houses he visited . I soon knew much that I wanted to know , although not all . But one fact I discovered , and think it right to inform you of it at once . He was on intimate terms with La Castagneto — at least , he frequently called upon her . "
16173	16194	16206	16207	The officials	263	" La Castagneto ! Do you mean the Countess of that name , who was a passenger in the sleeper ? "
16195	16205	16206	16207	The officials	263	" Beyond doubt ! it is she I mean . "
16256	16336	16233	16233	She	340	" He was at her house on the very day we all left Rome — in the evening , towards dusk . The Countess had an apartment in the Via Margutta , and when he left her he returned to his own place in the Condotti , entered the bank , stayed half an hour , then came out with one hand - bag and rug , called a cab , and was driven straight to the railway station . "
16337	16342	16233	16233	She	340	" And you followed ? "
16343	16415	16233	16233	She	340	" Of course . When I saw him walk straight to the sleeping - car , and ask the conductor for 7 and 8 , I knew that his plans had been laid , and that he was on the point of leaving Rome secretly . When , presently , La Castagneto also arrived , I concluded that she was in his confidence , and that possibly they were eloping together . "
16416	16424	16233	16233	She	340	" Why did you not arrest him ? "
16425	16496	16233	16233	She	340	" I had no authority , even if I had had the time . Although I was ordered to watch the Signor Quadling , I had no warrant for his arrest . But I decided on the spur of the moment what course I should take . It seemed to be the only one , and that was to embark in the same train and stick close to my man . "
16497	16506	16233	16233	She	340	" You informed your superiors , I suppose ? "
16507	16513	16515	16516	the Italian	324	" Pardon me , monsieur , "
16527	16566	16515	16516	the Italian	324	" but have you any right to inquire into my conduct towards my superiors ? In all that affects the murder I am at your orders , but in this other matter it is between me and them . "
16567	16610	16233	16233	She	340	" Ta , ta , ta ! They will tell us if you will not . And you had better be careful , lest you obstruct justice . Speak out , sir , and beware . What did you intend to do ? "
16611	16624	16233	16233	She	340	" To act according to circumstances . If my suspicions were confirmed — "
16625	16629	16233	16233	She	340	" What suspicions ? "
16630	16655	16233	16233	She	340	" Why — that this banker was carrying off any large sum in cash , notes , securities , as in effect he was . "
16656	16665	16233	16233	She	340	" Ah ! You know that ? How ? "
16666	16696	16233	16233	She	340	" By my own eyes . I looked into his compartment once and saw him in the act of counting them over , a great quantity , in fact — "
16718	16731	16706	16706	They	263	" And that , of course , would have justified his arrest ? "
16732	16762	16233	16233	She	340	" Exactly . I proposed , directly we arrived in Paris , to claim the assistance of your police and take him into custody . But his fate interposed . "
16833	16840	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" One or two words more , "
16847	16863	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" During the journey , now , did you have any conversation with this Quadling ? "
16864	16874	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" None . He kept very much to himself . "
16875	16887	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" You saw him , I suppose , at the restaurants ? "
16888	16896	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" Yes , at Modane and Laroche . "
16897	16905	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" But did not speak to him ? "
16906	16911	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" Not a word . "
16912	16928	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" Had he any suspicion , do you think , as to who you were ? "
16929	16950	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" Why should he ? He did not know me . I had taken pains he should never see me . "
16951	16960	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" Did he speak to any other passenger ? "
16961	16982	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" Very little . To the Countess . Yes , once or twice , I think , to her maid . "
16983	17012	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" Ah ! that maid . Did you notice her at all ? She has not been seen . It is strange . She seems to have disappeared . "
17013	17022	17024	17024	Ripaldi	73	" To have run away , in fact ? "
17031	17052	17024	17024	Ripaldi	73	" Well , at least she is not here with her mistress . Can you offer any explanation of that ? "
17053	17086	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" She was perhaps afraid . The Countess and she were very good friends , I think . On better , more familiar terms , than is usual between mistress and maid . "
17087	17093	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" The maid knew something ? "
17094	17116	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" Ah , monsieur , it is only an idea . But I give it you for what it is worth . "
17117	17130	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" Well , well , this maid — what was she like ? "
17131	17170	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" Tall , dark , good - looking , not too reserved . She made other friends — the porter and the English Colonel . I saw the last speaking to her . I spoke to her myself . "
17171	17179	17181	17182	the Judge	485	" What can have become of her ? "
17184	17217	17181	17182	the Judge	485	" Would M. le Juge like me to go in search of her ? That is , if you have no more questions to ask , no wish to detain me further ? "
17218	17238	16842	16843	the Judge	485	" We will consider that , and let you know in a moment , if you will wait outside . "
17275	17284	17286	17287	the detective	317	" Ah , but can he , though ? "
17289	17344	17286	17287	the detective	317	" How do we know he has told us truth ? What guarantee have we of his loyalty , his good faith ? What if he is also concerned in the crime — has some guilty knowledge ? What if he killed Quadling himself , or was an accomplice before or after the fact ? "
17345	17370	17372	17373	the Judge	485	" All these are possibilities , of course , but — pardon me , dear colleague — a little far - fetched , eh ? "
17375	17408	17372	17373	the Judge	485	" Why not utilize this man ? If he betrays us — serves us ill — if we had reason to lay hands on him again , he could hardly escape us . "
17409	17421	17423	17424	the Commissary	486	" Let him go , and send some one with him , "
17435	17438	17440	17441	the Judge	485	" Excellent ! "
17443	17459	17440	17441	the Judge	485	" You have another man here , Chief ; let him go with this Italian . "
17468	17495	17460	17460	They	646	" We will accept your services , monsieur , and you can begin your search at once . In what direction do you propose to begin ? "
17496	17503	17440	17441	the Judge	485	" Where has her mistress gone ? "
17504	17513	17440	17441	the Judge	485	" How do you know she has gone ? "
17514	17535	17460	17460	They	646	" At least , she is no longer with us out there . Have you arrested her — or what ? "
17536	17568	17440	17441	the Judge	485	" No , she is still at large , but we have our eye upon her . She has gone to her hotel — the Madagascar , off the Grands Boulevards . "
17569	17601	17440	17441	the Judge	485	" Then it is there that I shall look for the maid . No doubt she preceded her mistress to the hotel , or she will join her there very shortly . "
17602	17632	17460	17460	They	646	" You would not make yourself known , of course ? They might give you the slip . You have no authority to detain them , not in France . "
17633	17649	17460	17460	They	646	" I should take my precautions , and I can always appeal to the police . "
17650	17694	17440	17441	the Judge	485	" Exactly . That would be your proper course . But you might lose valuable time , a great opportunity , and we wish to guard against that , so we shall associate one of our own people with you in your proceedings . "
17695	17714	17715	17716	The Italian	324	" Oh ! very well , if you wish . It will , no doubt , be best . "
17743	17750	17752	17753	the Chief	247	" I will call in Block , "
17820	17824	17827	17828	the Chief	247	" This gentleman , "
17833	17882	17827	17828	the Chief	247	" is a member of the Roman police , and has been so obliging as to offer us his services . You will accompany him , in the first instance , to the Hôtel Madagascar . Put yourself in communication with Galipaud , who is there on duty . "
17883	17898	17900	17901	the Italian	324	" Would it not be sufficient if I made myself known to M. Galipaud ? "
17903	17915	17900	17901	the Italian	324	" I have seen him here , I should recognize him — "
17916	17947	17827	17828	the Chief	247	" That is not so certain ; he may have changed his appearance . Besides , he does not know the latest developments , and might not be very cordial . "
17948	17961	17900	17901	the Italian	324	" You might write me a few lines to take to him . "
17962	17973	17975	17976	the Chief	247	" I think not . We prefer to send Block , "
18019	18032	18036	18036	Ripaldi	73	" It was only to save trouble that I made the suggestion , "
18038	18083	18036	18036	Ripaldi	73	" Naturally I am in your hands . And if I do not meet with the maid at the hotel , I may have to look further , in which case Monsieur — Block ? thank you — would no doubt render valuable assistance . "
18117	18121	18123	18124	the Judge	485	" What next ? "
18126	18140	18142	18143	the detective	317	" That pestilent English officer , if you please , M. le Juge , "
18145	18192	18142	18143	the detective	317	" That fire - eating , swashbuckling soldier , with his blustering barrack - room ways . I long to come to close quarters with him . He ridiculed me , taunted me , said I knew nothing — we will see , we will see . "
18193	18213	18220	18220	he	56	" In fact , you wish to interrogate him yourself . Very well . Let us have him in . "
18252	18260	18220	18220	he	56	" I presume I may sit down ? "
18261	18271	18273	18274	the Judge	485	" Pardon . Of course ; pray be seated , "
18286	18295	18298	18299	the General	203	" Ah ! thanks . Do you object ? "
18309	18315	18316	18316	He	203	" May I offer one ? "
18323	18331	18333	18334	the Chief	247	" We do not smoke on duty , "
18338	18349	18333	18334	the Chief	247	" Nor is smoking permitted in a court of justice . "
18350	18399	18400	18400	He	203	" Come , come , I wish to show no disrespect . But I can not recognize this as a court of justice , and I think , if you will forgive me , that I shall take three whiffs . It may help me keep my temper . "
18441	18448	18451	18452	the Chief	247	" You call yourself General Collingham ? "
18454	18473	18451	18452	the Chief	247	" I do not call myself . I am General Sir Charles Collingham , of the British Army . "
18474	18477	18451	18452	the Chief	247	" Retired ? "
18478	18489	18451	18452	the Chief	247	" No , I am still on the active list . "
18490	18499	18451	18452	the Chief	247	" These points will have to be verified . "
18500	18515	18451	18452	the Chief	247	" With all my heart . You have already sent to the British Embassy ? "
18516	18525	18527	18528	the detective	317	" Yes , but no one has come , "
18532	18544	18527	18528	the detective	317	" If you disbelieve me , why do you question me ? "
18545	18593	18451	18452	the Chief	247	" It is our duty to question you , and yours to answer . If not , we have means to make you . You are suspected , inculpated in a terrible crime , and your whole attitude is — is — objectionable — unworthy — disgr — "
18594	18603	18605	18606	the Judge	485	" Gently , gently , my dear colleague , "
18608	18649	18605	18606	the Judge	485	" If you will permit me , I will take up this . And you , M. le Général , I am sure you can not wish to impede or obstruct us ; we represent the law of this country . "
18650	18660	18662	18663	the General	203	" Have I done so , M. le Juge ? "
18680	18720	18671	18671	he	203	" No , no . I do not imply that in the least . I only entreat you , as a good and gallant gentleman , to meet us in a proper spirit and give us your best help . "
18721	18753	18754	18755	The General	203	" Indeed , I am quite ready . If there has been any unpleasantness , it has surely not been of my making , but rather of that little man there . "
18770	18791	18793	18794	the Judge	485	" Well , well , let us say no more of that , and proceed to business . I understand , "
18809	18830	18793	18794	the Judge	485	" that you are a friend of the Contessa di Castagneto ? Indeed , she has told us so herself . "
18831	18854	18754	18755	The General	203	" It was very good of her to call me her friend . I am proud to hear she so considers me . "
18855	18863	18754	18755	The General	203	" How long have you known her ? "
18864	18881	18793	18794	the Judge	485	" Four or five months . Since the beginning of the last winter season in Rome . "
18882	18889	18754	18755	The General	203	" Did you frequent her house ? "
18890	18908	18754	18755	The General	203	" If you mean , was I permitted to call on her on friendly terms , yes . "
18909	18917	18793	18794	the Judge	485	" Did you know all her friends ? "
18918	18936	18793	18794	the Judge	485	" How can I answer that ? I know whom I met there from time to time . "
18937	18951	18754	18755	The General	203	" Exactly . Did you often meet among them a Signor — Quadling ? "
18952	18979	18754	18755	The General	203	" Quadling — Quadling ? I can not say that I have . The name is familiar somehow , but I can not recall the man . "
18980	18994	18793	18794	the Judge	485	" Have you never heard of the Roman bankers , Correse & Quadling ? "
18995	19018	18793	18794	the Judge	485	" Ah , of course . Although I have had no dealing with them . Certainly I have never met Mr. Quadling . "
19019	19026	18754	18755	The General	203	" Not at the Countess 's ? "
19027	19037	18793	18794	the Judge	485	" Never — of that I am quite sure . "
19038	19054	18793	18794	the Judge	485	" And yet we have had positive evidence that he was a constant visitor there . "
19055	19082	18754	18755	The General	203	" It is perfectly incomprehensible to me . Not only have I never met him , but I have never heard the Countess mention his name . "
19083	19129	18793	18794	the Judge	485	" It will surprise you , then , to be told that he called at her apartment in the Via Margutta on the very evening of her departure from Rome . Called , was admitted , was closeted with her for more than an hour . "
19130	19168	18793	18794	the Judge	485	" I am surprised , astounded . I called there myself about four in the afternoon to offer my services for the journey , and I too stayed till after five . I can hardly believe it . "
19169	19232	18754	18755	The General	203	" I have more surprises for you , General . What will you think when I tell you that this very Quadling — this friend , acquaintance , call him what you please , but at least intimate enough to pay her a visit on the eve of a long journey — was the man found murdered in the sleeping - car ? "
19233	19243	19245	19246	Sir Charles	56	" Can it be possible ? Are you sure ? "
19254	19277	19245	19246	Sir Charles	56	" And what do you deduce from all this ? What do you imply ? An accusation against that lady ? Absurd ! "
19278	19347	18754	18755	The General	203	" I respect your chivalrous desire to stand up for a lady who calls you her friend , but we are officials first , and sentiment can not be permitted to influence us . We have good reasons for suspecting that lady . I tell you that frankly , and trust to you as a soldier and man of honour not to abuse the confidence reposed in you . "
19348	19356	18754	18755	The General	203	" May I not know those reasons ? "
19357	19377	19245	19246	Sir Charles	56	" Because she was in the car — the only woman , you understand — between Laroche and Paris . "
19378	19388	19390	19391	the General	203	" Do you suspect a female hand , then ? "
19399	19414	19390	19391	the General	203	" That is so , although I am exceeding my duty in revealing this . "
19415	19463	18754	18755	The General	203	" And you are satisfied that this lady , a refined , delicate person in the best society , of the highest character,—believe me , I know that to be the case,—whom you yet suspect of an atrocious crime , was the only female in the car ? "
19464	19497	19245	19246	Sir Charles	56	" Obviously . Who else ? What other woman could possibly have been in the car ? No one got in at Laroche ; the train never stopped till it reached Paris . "
19498	19521	18754	18755	The General	203	" On that last point at least you are quite mistaken , I assure you . Why not upon the other also ? "
19522	19527	19529	19530	the detective	317	" The train stopped ? "
19532	19541	19529	19530	the detective	317	" Why has no one told us that ? "
19542	19567	19570	19570	himself	317	" Possibly because you never asked . But it is nevertheless the fact . Verify it . Every one will tell you the same . "
19626	19636	19638	19639	the detective	317	" At whose instance was the train pulled up ? "
19724	19731	19732	19733	the Judge	485	" This is a new light , "
19736	19745	19746	19746	he	485	" Do you draw any conclusion from it ? "
19754	19786	19787	19788	The Judge	485	" That is surely your business . I have only elicited the fact to disprove your theory . But if you wish , I will tell you how it strikes me . "
19792	19851	19787	19788	The Judge	485	" The bare fact that the train was halted would mean little . That would be the natural act of a timid or excitable person involved indirectly in such a catastrophe . But to disavow the act starts suspicion . The fair inference is that there was some reason , an unavowable reason , for halting the train . "
19852	19859	19746	19746	he	485	" And that reason would be — "
19860	19887	19746	19746	he	485	" You must see it without my assistance , surely ! Why , what else but to afford some one an opportunity to leave the car . "
19888	19928	19787	19788	The Judge	485	" But how could that be ? You would have seen that person , some of you , especially at such a critical time . The aisle would be full of people , both exits were thus practically overlooked . "
19929	19962	19746	19746	he	485	" My idea is — it is only an idea , understand — that the person had already left the car — that is to say , the interior of the car . "
19963	19974	19746	19746	he	485	" Escaped how ? Where ? What do you mean ? "
19975	19991	19787	19788	The Judge	485	" Escaped through the open window of the compartment where you found the murdered man . "
19992	20001	20004	20005	the detective	317	" You noticed the open window , then ? "
20007	20012	20004	20005	the detective	317	" When was that ? "
20013	20039	19787	19788	The Judge	485	" Directly I entered the compartment at the first alarm . It occurred to me at once that some one might have gone through it . "
20040	20069	20071	20072	the detective	317	" But no woman could have done it . To climb out of an express train going at top speed would be an impossible feat for a woman , "
20076	20103	20071	20072	the detective	317	" Why , in God 's name , do you still harp upon the woman ? Why should it be a woman more than a man ? "
20104	20105	20107	20108	the Judge	485	" Because"—it
20145	20148	20164	20164	he	485	" Because , "
20154	20162	20164	20164	he	485	decision—"because this was found in the compartment ; "
20185	20239	20164	20164	he	485	" You have seen these , or one of them , or something like them before . I am sure of it ; I call upon you ; I demand — no , I appeal to your sense of honour , Sir Collingham . Tell me , please , exactly what you know . "
20265	20323	20260	20260	he	203	" It is my duty to withhold nothing . It is not the lace . That I could not swear to ; for me — and probably for most men — two pieces of lace are very much the same . But I think I have seen these beads , or something exactly like them , before . "
20324	20329	20260	20260	he	203	" Where ? When ? "
20330	20347	20260	20260	he	203	" They formed part of the trimming of a mantle worn by the Contessa di Castagneto . "
20348	20351	20260	20260	he	203	" Ah ! "
20400	20409	20411	20412	the Judge	485	" Did she wear it on the journey ? "
20414	20423	20411	20412	the Judge	485	" As to that I can not say . "
20424	20451	20459	20460	M. Floçon	58	" Come , come , General , you were with her constantly ; you must be able to tell us . We insist on being told . "
20462	20521	20459	20460	M. Floçon	58	" I repeat that I can not say . To the best of my recollection , the Countess wore a long travelling cloak — an ulster , as we call them . The jacket with those bead ornaments may have been underneath . But if I have seen them,—as I believe I have,—it was not during this journey . "
20530	20540	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" The searcher did not discover any second mantle . "
20541	20551	20552	20552	he	485	" How do we know the woman examined thoroughly ? "
20555	20580	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" Here , at least , is direct evidence as to the beads . At last the net is drawing round this fine Countess . "
20581	20588	20590	20591	the detective	317	" Well , at any rate , "
20599	20620	20590	20591	the detective	317	" these beads were found in the compartment of the murdered man . I should like that explained , please . "
20621	20653	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" By me ? How can I explain it ? And the fact does not bear upon what we were considering , as to whether any one had left the car . "
20654	20658	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" Why not ? "
20659	20697	20590	20591	the detective	317	" The Countess , as we know , never left the car . As to her entering this particular compartment,—at any previous time,—it is highly improbable . Indeed , it is rather insulting her to suggest it . "
20698	20707	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" She and this Quadling were close friends . "
20708	20726	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" So you say . On what evidence I do not know , but I dispute it . "
20727	20745	20590	20591	the detective	317	" Then how could the beads get there ? They were her property , worn by her . "
20746	20786	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" Once , I admit , but not necessarily on this journey . Suppose she had given the mantle away — to her maid , for instance ; I believe ladies often pass on their things to their maids . "
20787	20812	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" It is all pure presumption , a mere theory . This maid — she has not as yet been imported into the discussion . "
20813	20839	20590	20591	the detective	317	" Then I would suggest that you do so without delay . She is to my mind a — well , rather a curious person . "
20840	20849	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" You know her — spoke to her ? "
20850	20881	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" I know her , in a way . I had seen her in the Via Margutta , and I nodded to her when she came first into the car . "
20882	20894	20590	20591	the detective	317	" And on the journey — you spoke to her frequently ? "
20895	20941	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" I ? Oh , dear , no , not at all . I noticed her , certainly ; I could not help it , and perhaps I ought to tell her mistress . She seemed to make friends a little too readily with people . "
20942	20948	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" As for instance — ? "
20949	20998	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" With the porter to begin with . I saw them together at Laroche , in the buffet at the bar ; and that Italian , the man who was in here before me ; indeed , with the murdered man . She seemed to know them all . "
20999	21014	20590	20591	the detective	317	" Do you imply that the maid might be of use in this inquiry ? "
21015	21047	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" Most assuredly I do . As I tell you , she was constantly in and out of the car , and more or less intimate with several of the passengers . "
21048	21056	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" Including her mistress , the Countess , "
21067	21106	21062	21063	The General	203	" Most ladies are , I presume , on intimate terms with their maids . They say no man is a hero to his valet . It is the same , I suppose , with the other sex . "
21107	21111	21114	21116	the little detective	697	" So intimate , "
21123	21141	21114	21116	the little detective	697	" that now the maid has disappeared lest she might be asked inconvenient questions about her mistress . "
21142	21149	20523	20524	the Judge	485	" Disappeared ? You are sure ? "
21150	21163	21062	21063	The General	203	" She can not be found , that is all we know . "
21164	21181	21183	21184	Sir Charles	56	" It is as I thought , then . She it was who left the car ! "
21209	21226	21062	21063	The General	203	" Explain yourself . Quick , quick . What in God 's name do you mean ? "
21227	21363	21062	21063	The General	203	" I had my suspicions from the first , and I will tell you why . At Laroche the car emptied , as you may have heard ; every one except the Countess , at least , went over to the restaurant for early coffee ; I with the rest . I was one of the first to finish , and I strolled back to the platform to get a few whiffs of a cigarette . At that moment I saw , or thought I saw , the end of a skirt disappearing into the sleeping - car . I concluded it was this maid , Hortense , who was taking her mistress a cup of coffee . Then my brother came up , we exchanged a few words , and entered the car together . "
21364	21380	21062	21063	The General	203	" By the same door as that through which you had seen the skirt pass ? "
21381	21461	21062	21063	The General	203	" No , by the other . My brother went back to his berth , but I paused in the corridor to finish my cigarette after the train had gone on . By this time every one but myself had returned to his berth , and I was on the point of lying down again for half an hour , when I distinctly heard the handle turned of the compartment I knew to be vacant all through the run . "
21462	21473	21062	21063	The General	203	" That was the one with berths 11 and 12 ? "
21474	21497	21062	21063	The General	203	" Probably . It was next to the Countess . Not only was the handle turned , but the door partly opened — "
21498	21505	21062	21063	The General	203	" It was not the porter ? "
21506	21534	21062	21063	The General	203	" Oh , no , he was in his seat,—you know it , at the end of the car,—sound asleep , snoring ; I could hear him . "
21535	21546	21062	21063	The General	203	" Did any one come out of the vacant compartment ? "
21547	21600	21062	21063	The General	203	" No ; but I was almost certain , I believe I could swear that I saw the same skirt , just the hem of it , a black skirt , sway forward beyond the door , just for a second . Then all at once the door was closed again fast . "
21601	21617	21062	21063	The General	203	" What did you conclude from this ? Or did you think nothing of it ? "
21618	21677	21062	21063	The General	203	" I thought very little . I supposed it was that the maid wished to be near her mistress as we were approaching Paris , and I had heard from the Countess that the porter had made many difficulties . But you see , after what has happened , that there was a reason for stopping the train . "
21678	21682	21062	21063	The General	203	" Quite so , "
21731	21757	21758	21758	he	58	" And you still have an impression that some one — presumably this woman — got off the car , somehow , during the stoppage ? "
21761	21784	21758	21758	he	58	" I suggest it , certainly . Whether it was or could be so , I must leave to your superior judgment . "
21785	21804	21825	21826	the Judge	485	" What ! A woman climb out like that ? Bah ! Tell that to some one else ! "
21805	21822	21825	21826	the Judge	485	" You have , of course , examined the exterior of the car , dear colleague ? "
21828	21887	21825	21826	the Judge	485	" Assuredly , once , but I will do it again . Still , the outside is quite smooth , there is no foot - board . Only an acrobat could succeed in thus escaping , and then only at the peril of his life . But a woman — oh , no ! it is too absurd . "
21888	21904	21907	21908	Sir Charles	56	" With help she might , I think , get up on to the roof , "
21910	21938	21907	21908	Sir Charles	56	" I have looked out of the window of my compartment . It would be nothing for a man , nor much for a woman if assisted . "
21939	21947	21949	21950	the detective	317	" That we will see for ourselves , "
21954	21960	21962	21963	the Judge	485	" The sooner the better , "
22024	22035	22037	22038	the General	203	" Halloa , Jack ! you are a good chap , "
22047	22055	22037	22038	the General	203	" I was sure you would come . "
22056	22096	22104	22105	the attaché	727	" Come , sir ! Of course I came . I was just going to an official function , as you see , but his Excellency insisted , my horse was at the door , and here I am . "
22146	22169	22170	22170	He	727	" Of course we will answer for him . He shall remain at your disposal , and will appear whenever called upon . "
22178	22186	22170	22170	He	727	" You will promise that , sir ? "
22187	22252	22253	22255	The French Judge	732	" Oh , willingly . I had always meant to stay on a bit in Paris . And really I should like to see the end of this . But my brother ? He must get home for next Sunday 's duty . He has nothing to tell , but he would come back to Paris at any time if his evidence was wanted . "
22473	22478	22480	22481	the detective	317	" What is it ? "
22517	22532	22545	22545	he	317	" I could not swear to it , but I believe it is blood . "
22533	22539	22541	22542	the detective	317	" Blood ! Good Heavens ! "
22562	22569	22570	22570	he	317	" Look , M. le Juge , "
22580	22585	22570	22570	he	317	" What say you ? "
22586	22606	22570	22570	he	317	" It has that appearance . Only medical evidence can positively decide , but I believe it is blood . "
22607	22626	22570	22570	he	317	" Now we are on the right track , I feel convinced . Some one fetch a ladder . "
22665	22700	22659	22659	his	317	" There is more here , much more , and something like — yes , beyond question it is — the print of two hands upon the roof . It was here she climbed . "
22701	22744	22746	22747	the Judge	485	" No doubt . I can see it now exactly . She would sit on the window ledge , the lower limbs inside the car here and held there . Then with her hands she would draw herself up to the roof , "
22749	22759	22746	22747	the Judge	485	" But what nerve ! what strength of arm ! "
22760	22794	22659	22659	his	317	" It was life and death . Within the car was more terrible danger . Fear will do much in such a case . We all know that . Well ! what more ? "
22810	22841	22843	22843	he	317	" More , more , much more ! Footprints , as plain as a picture . A woman 's feet . Wait , let me follow them to the end , "
22886	22956	22874	22874	his	317	" Dangerous or not , difficult or not , she did it . I have traced her ; have seen where she must have lain crouching ever so long , followed her all along the top of the car , to the end where she got down above the little platform exit . Beyond doubt she left the car when it stopped , and by arrangement with her confederate . "
22957	22961	23081	23082	the detective	317	" The Countess ? "
22962	22966	23081	23082	the detective	317	" Who else ? "
22967	22991	22874	22874	his	317	" And at a point near Paris . The English General said the halt was within twenty minutes ' run of the station . "
22992	23016	22874	22874	his	317	" Then it is from that point we must commence our search for her . The Italian has gone on the wrong scent . "
23017	23037	23081	23082	the detective	317	" Not necessarily . The maid , we may be sure , will try to communicate with her mistress . "
23038	23054	23056	23057	the Judge	485	" Still , it would be well to secure her before she can do that , "
23059	23078	23081	23082	the detective	317	" With all we know now , a sharp interrogation might extract some very damaging admissions from her , "
23086	23115	23081	23082	the detective	317	" Who is to go ? I have sent away both my assistants . Of course I can telephone for another man , or I might go myself . "
23116	23152	23081	23082	the detective	317	" No , no , dear colleague , we can not spare you just yet . Telephone by all means . I presume you would wish to be present at the rest of the interrogatories ? "
23153	23195	23081	23082	the detective	317	" Certainly , you are right . We may elicit more about this maid . Let us call in the porter now . He is said to have had relations with her . Something more may be got out of him . "
23248	23252	23254	23255	the Judge	485	" Speak out , "
23259	23283	23289	23289	he	62	" Tell us everything plainly and promptly , or I shall send you straight to gaol . The order is already made out ; "
23299	23304	23305	23306	the porter	155	" I know nothing , "
23311	23340	23289	23289	he	62	" That is false . We are fully informed and no fools . We are certain that no such catastrophe could have occurred without your knowledge or connivance . "
23341	23348	23254	23255	the Judge	485	" Indeed , gentlemen , indeed — "
23349	23379	23254	23255	the Judge	485	" You were drinking with this maid at the buffet at Laroche . You had more drink with her , or from her hands , afterwards in the car . "
23380	23401	23254	23255	the Judge	485	" No , gentlemen , that is not so . I could not — she was not in the car . "
23402	23432	23254	23255	the Judge	485	" We know better . You can not deceive us . You were her accomplice , and the accomplice of her mistress , also , I have no doubt . "
23433	23497	23254	23255	the Judge	485	" I declare solemnly that I am quite innocent of all this . I hardly remember what happened at Laroche or after . I do not deny the drink at the buffet . It was very nasty , I thought , and could not tell why , nor why I could not hold my head up when I got back to the car . "
23498	23513	23254	23255	the Judge	485	" You went off to sleep at once ? Is that what you pretend ? "
23514	23535	23254	23255	the Judge	485	" It must have been so . Yes . Then I know nothing more , not till I was aroused . "
23555	23570	23572	23573	the Judge	485	" He is either too clever for us or an absolute idiot and fool , "
23586	23618	23572	23573	the Judge	485	" We had better commit him to Mazas and hold him there in solitary confinement under our hands . After a day or two of that he may be less difficult . "
23619	23641	23665	23666	the Judge	485	" It is quite clear he was drugged , that the maid put opium or laudanum into his drink at Laroche . "
23642	23664	23665	23666	the Judge	485	" And enough of it apparently , for he says he went off to sleep directly he returned to the car , "
23669	23696	23698	23699	the Chief	247	" He says so . But he must have had a second dose , or why was the vial found on the ground by his seat ? "
23712	23768	23698	23699	the Chief	247	" I can not believe in a second dose . How was it administered — by whom ? It was laudanum , and could only be given in a drink . He says he had no second drink . And by whom ? The maid ? He says he did not see the maid again . "
23769	23879	23665	23666	the Judge	485	" Pardon me , M. le Juge , but do you not give too much credibility to the porter ? For me , his evidence is tainted , and I hardly believe a word of it . Did he not tell me at first he had not seen this maid after Amberieux at 8 P.M. ? Now he admits that he was drinking with her at the buffet at Laroche . It is all a tissue of lies , his losing the pocket - book and his papers too . There is something to conceal . Even his sleepiness , his stupidity , are likely to have been assumed . "
23880	23900	23698	23699	the Chief	247	" I do not think he is acting ; he has not the ability to deceive us like that . "
23901	23916	23698	23699	the Chief	247	" Well , then , what if the Countess took him the second drink ? "
23917	23938	23665	23666	the Judge	485	" Oh ! oh ! That is the purest conjecture . There is nothing whatever to suggest or support that . "
23939	23954	23698	23699	the Chief	247	" Then how explain the finding of the vial near the porter 's seat ? "
23955	23966	23698	23699	the Chief	247	" May it not have been dropped there on purpose ? "
23978	23982	23984	23985	the detective	317	" On purpose ? "
23998	24008	23984	23985	the detective	317	" On purpose to bring suspicion on the lady ? "
24009	24053	23698	23699	the Chief	247	" I do n't see it in that light . That would imply that she was not in the plot , and plot there certainly was ; everything points to it . The drugging , the open window , the maid 's escape . "
24054	24109	23698	23699	the Chief	247	" A plot , no doubt , but organized by whom ? These two women only ? Could either of them have struck the fatal blow ? Hardly . Women have the wit to conceive , but neither courage nor brute force to execute . There was a man in this , rest assured . "
24110	24123	24126	24127	the detective	317	" Granted . But who ? That fire - eating Sir Collingham ? "
24137	24153	24155	24156	the Judge	485	" That is not a solution that commends itself to me , I must confess , "
24158	24180	24155	24156	the Judge	485	" The General 's conduct has been blameworthy and injudicious , but he is not of the stuff that makes criminals . "
24181	24226	23698	23699	the Chief	247	" Who , then ? The porter ? No ? The clergyman ? No ? The French gentlemen?—well , we have not examined them yet ; but from what I saw at the first cursory glance , I am not disposed to suspect them . "
24227	24233	24235	24236	the Commissary	486	" What of that Italian ? "
24238	24272	24235	24236	the Commissary	486	" Are you sure of him ? His looks did not please me greatly , and he was very eager to get away from here . What if he takes to his heels ? "
24273	24279	24280	24281	the Chief	247	" Block is with him , "
24296	24311	24280	24281	the Chief	247	" We have touch of him if we want him , as we may . "
24577	24579	24575	24575	he	781	" yes "
24606	24613	24575	24575	he	781	" Did you speak to her ? "
24614	24655	24575	24575	he	781	" Oh , no . I had no opportunity . Besides , she had her own friends-- great friends , I fancy . I caught her more than once whispering in the corner of the car with one of them . "
24656	24661	24575	24575	he	781	" And that was-- ? "
24662	24705	24575	24575	he	781	" I think the Italian gentleman ; I am almost sure I recognized his clothes . I did not see his face , it was turned from me -- towards hers , and very close , I may be permitted to say . "
24706	24712	24575	24575	he	781	" And they were friendly ? "
24713	24768	24575	24575	he	781	" More than friendly , I should say . Very intimate indeed . I should not have been surprised if -- when I turned away as a matter of fact -- if he did not touch , just touch , her red lips . It would have been excusable -- forgive me , messieurs . "
24769	24808	24575	24575	he	781	" Aha ! They were so intimate as that ? Indeed ! And did she reserve her favours exclusively for him ? Did no one else address her , pay her court on the quiet -- you understand ? "
24809	24836	24575	24575	he	781	" I saw her with the porter , I believe , at Laroche , but only then . No , the Italian was her chief companion . "
24837	24850	24575	24575	he	781	" Did any one else notice the flirtation , do you think ? "
24851	24869	24575	24575	he	781	" Possibly . There was no secrecy . It was very marked . We could all see . "
24870	24876	24575	24575	he	781	" And her mistress too ? "
24877	24894	24575	24575	he	781	" That I will not say . The lady I saw but little during the journey . "
25004	25014	25015	25015	he	68	" No ; she kept very much to herself , "
25018	25039	25015	25015	he	68	" I saw her but little , hardly at all , except at Modane . She kept her own berth . "
25040	25048	24999	24999	he	68	" Where she received her own friends ? "
25049	25067	25015	25015	he	68	" Oh , beyond doubt . The Englishmen both visited her there , but not the Italian . "
25068	25082	25015	25015	he	68	" The Italian ? Are we to infer that she knew the Italian ? "
25083	25136	24999	24999	he	68	" That is what I wish to convey . Not on the journey , though . Between Rome and Paris she did not seem to know him . It was afterwards ; this morning , in fact , that I came to the conclusion that there was some secret understanding between them . "
25137	25147	25149	25150	the detective	317	" Why do you say that , M. Devaux ? "
25154	25182	25149	25150	the detective	317	" Let me urge you and implore you to speak out , and fully . This is of the utmost , of the very first , importance . "
25183	25253	24999	24999	he	68	" Well , gentlemen , I will tell you . As you are well aware , on arrival at this station we were all ordered to leave the car , and marched to the waiting - room , out there . As a matter of course , the lady entered first , and she was seated when I went in . There was a strong light on her face . "
25254	25260	24999	24999	he	68	" Was her veil down ? "
25261	25327	25149	25150	the detective	317	" Not then . I saw her lower it later , and , as I think , for reasons I will presently put before you . Madame has a beautiful face , and I gazed at it with sympathy , grieving for her , in fact , in such a trying situation ; when suddenly I saw a great and remarkable change come over it . "
25328	25333	24999	24999	he	68	" Of what character ? "
25334	25380	24999	24999	he	68	" It was a look of horror , disgust , surprise,--a little perhaps of all three ; I could not quite say which , it faded so quickly and was followed by a cold , deathlike pallor . Then almost immediately she lowered her veil . "
25381	25399	25149	25150	the detective	317	" Could you form any explanation for what you saw in her face ? What caused it ? "
25400	25447	24999	24999	he	68	" Something unexpected , I believe , some shock , or the sight of something shocking . That was how it struck me , and so forcibly that I turned to look over my shoulder , expecting to find the reason there . And it was . "
25448	25452	24999	24999	he	68	" That reason-- ? "
25453	25520	25149	25150	the detective	317	" Was the entrance of the Italian , who came just behind me . I am certain of this ; he almost told me so himself , not in words , but the mistakable leer he gave her in reply . It was wicked , sardonic , devilish , and proved beyond doubt that there was some secret , some guilty secret perhaps , between them . "
25521	25527	25530	25531	the Judge	485	" And was that all ? "
25548	25596	25542	25542	their	798	" For the moment , yes . But I was made so interested , so suspicious by this , that I watched the Italian closely , awaiting , expecting further developments . They were long in coming ; indeed , I am only at the end now . "
25597	25613	25149	25150	the detective	317	" Explain , pray , as quickly as possible , and in your own words . "
25614	25742	25542	25542	their	798	" It was like this , monsieur . When we were all seated , I looked round , and did not at first see our Italian . At last I discovered he had taken a back seat , through modesty perhaps , or to be out of observation -- how was I to know ? He sat in the shadow by a door , that , in fact , which leads into this room . He was thus in the background , rather out of the way , but I could see his eyes glittering in that far - off corner , and they were turned in our direction , always fixed upon the lady , you understand . She was next me , the whole time . "
25833	25853	25855	25855	I	0	" There was some reason for this , I felt sure , although I did not understand it immediately . "
25954	26059	25931	25931	he	175	" Well , gentlemen , I was now satisfied in my own mind that this was some artful attempt of his to communicate with the lady , and had she fallen in with it , I should have immediately informed you , the proper authorities . But whether from stupidity , dread , disinclination , a direct , definite refusal to have any dealings with this man , the lady would not -- at any rate did not -- pick up the ball , as she might have done easily when she in her turn passed the table on her way to your presence . "
26113	26114	26107	26107	she	169	" "
26123	26131	26132	26132	I	0	" asked the detective in breathless excitement . "
26137	26163	26132	26132	I	0	" M. Devaux opened the palm of his hand and displayed the scrap of paper in the hollow rolled up into a small tight ball . "
26174	26175	26176	26176	I	0	" "
26213	26214	26197	26197	I	0	" "
26240	26241	26235	26235	you	0	" "
26288	26289	26283	26283	I	0	" "
26299	26321	26283	26283	I	0	" said the detective , unrolling the paper , which he handed on to the Judge , who read the contents aloud-- "
26339	26359	26360	26360	Monsieur	1266	" A long silence followed , broken first by the Judge , who said at last solemnly to Devaux : "
26399	26400	26392	26392	you	1266	" "
26427	26477	26421	26421	I	0	" Beyond doubt it had been reserved for the last witness to produce facts that constituted the very essence of the inquiry . The examination was now over , and , the dispositions having been drawn up and signed , the investigating officials remained for some time in conference . "
26513	26518	26494	26494	They	825	" said the detective . "
26526	26531	26520	26521	all three	826	" added the Judge . "
26560	26561	26540	26542	M. le Juge	61	" "
26568	26582	26540	26542	M. le Juge	61	" remarked the Commissary , eager , as usual , for decisive action . "
26597	26607	26609	26609	you	1266	" said the Judge , turning to his clerk . "
26611	26620	26609	26609	you	1266	" he went on , addressing M. Floçon , "
26680	26681	26682	26682	I	0	" "
26711	26723	26724	26725	The inspector	832	" said M. Floçon to the guard whom he called in . "
26729	26740	26741	26741	He	832	" said the guard , pointing to the outer room . "
26746	26747	26741	26741	He	832	" "
26754	26755	26750	26750	You	1255	" "
26774	26775	26776	26776	Block	60	" "
26802	26842	26798	26800	M. le Juge	61	" When Block appeared , it was evident that something had gone wrong with him . His face wore a look of hot , flurried excitement , and his manner was one of abject , cringing self - abasement . "
26847	26855	26856	26856	You	1266	" asked the little Chief , sharply . "
26865	26866	26862	26863	your man	836	" "
26888	26889	26883	26883	I	0	" "
26911	26912	26924	26926	Triple _ idiot	839	" "
26919	26920	26921	26921	Idiot	838	" "
26946	27006	26938	26938	You	838	" M. Floçon raved furiously at his abashed subordinate , blaming him a little too harshly and unfairly , forgetting that until quite recently there had been no strong suspicion against the Italian . We are apt at times to expect others to be intuitively possessed of knowledge that has only come to us at a much later date . "
27038	27039	27029	27029	You	838	" "
27079	27080	27076	27076	himself	847	" "
27084	27089	27076	27076	himself	847	" growled the Chief . "
27175	27176	27208	27208	he	847	" "
27188	27189	27208	27208	he	847	" "
27261	27262	27264	27264	you	853	" "
27272	27273	27274	27274	My	0	" "
27340	27364	27368	27368	I	0	" In spite of his anguish , Block smacked his fat lips at the thought of this most succulent but very greasy dish . "
27375	27376	27368	27368	I	0	" "
27445	27446	27447	27448	Great Heavens	102	" "

27673	27714	27666	27667	my man	1574	" ' There may be some trouble about changing that bank - note . Excuse me one moment , pray . ' He went out , monsieur , and piff - paff , he was no more to be seen . "
27715	27747	27666	27667	my man	1574	" Ah , _ nigaud _ ( ass ) , you are too foolish to live ! Why did you not follow him ? Why let him out of your sight ? "
27748	27794	27666	27667	my man	1574	" But , monsieur , I was not to know , was I ? I was to accompany him , not to watch him . I have done wrong , I confess . But then , who was to tell he meant to run away ? "
27837	27843	27846	27846	Block	60	" He was so artful , "
27854	27875	27846	27846	Block	60	" He left everything behind . His overcoat , stick , this book -- his own private memorandum - book seemingly-- "
27876	27883	27885	27886	the Chief	247	" Book ? Hand it me , "
27926	27957	27895	27895	he	247	" I do not understand , not more than a word here and there . It is no doubt Italian . Do you know that language , M. le Juge ? "
27958	27971	27972	27972	He	247	" Not perfectly , but I can read it . Allow me . "
28020	28103	28009	28010	M. Floçon	58	" You will have to find him , Block , and that speedily , within twenty - four hours,--to - day , indeed,--or I will break you like a stick , and send you into the gutter . Of course , such a consummate ass as you have proved yourself would not think of searching the restaurant or the immediate neighbourhood , or of making inquiries as to whether he had been seen , or as to which way he had gone ? "
28104	28150	27895	27895	he	247	" Pardon me , monsieur is too hard on me . I have been unfortunate , a victim to circumstances , still I believe I know my duty . Yes , I made inquiries , and , what is more , I heard of him . "
28151	28156	28158	28159	the Chief	247	" Where ? how ? "
28168	28211	28158	28159	the Chief	247	" He never spoke to the manager , but walked out and let the change go . It was a note for a hundred _ lire _ , a hundred francs , and the restaurant bill was no more than seventeen francs . "
28212	28222	27895	27895	he	247	" Hah ! that is greatly against him indeed . "
28223	28253	27895	27895	he	247	" He was much pressed , in a great hurry . Directly he crossed the threshold he called the first cab and was driving away , but he was stopped-- "
28254	28267	28158	28159	the Chief	247	" The devil ! Why did they not keep him , then ? "
28268	28283	27895	27895	he	247	" Stopped , but only for a moment , and accosted by a woman . "
28284	28288	27895	27895	he	247	" A woman ? "
28289	28328	27895	27895	he	247	" Yes , monsieur . They exchanged but three words . He wished to pass on , to leave her , she would not consent , then they both got into the cab and were driven away together . "
28338	28342	28344	28345	the Chief	247	" Tell me , "
28347	28364	28344	28345	the Chief	247	" quick , this woman -- what was she like ? Did you get her description ? "
28365	28405	27895	27895	he	247	" Tall , slight , well formed , dressed all in black . Her face -- it was a policeman who saw her , and he said she was good - looking , dark , brunette , black hair . "
28406	28413	28415	28417	the little Chief	278	" It is the maid herself ! "
28429	28437	28415	28417	the little Chief	278	" The maid ! the missing maid ! "
28507	28546	28489	28492	M. Beaumont le Hardi	75	" But if it was this Hortense Petitpré how did she get there , by the bridge Henri Quatre , when we thought to find her somewhere down the line ? It can not be the same woman . "
28547	28555	28557	28557	Block	60	" I beg your pardon , gentlemen , "
28559	28598	28557	28557	Block	60	" May I say one word ? I believe I can supply some interesting information about Hortense Petitpré . I understand that some one like her was seen here in the station not more than an hour ago . "
28599	28612	28614	28615	the Chief	247	" _ Peste ! _ Why were we not told this sooner ? "
28619	28642	28614	28615	the Chief	247	" Who saw her ? Did he speak to her ? Call him in ; let us see how much he knows . "
28700	28705	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" _ Fichtre ! _ "
28712	28724	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" and this is the first we have heard of it . "
28725	28747	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" Monsieur was much occupied at the time , and , indeed , then we had not heard of your inquiry . "
28748	28772	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" I notified the station - master quite early , two or three hours since , about 9 A.M. This is most exasperating ! "
28773	28797	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" Instructions to look out for this woman have only just reached us , monsieur . There were certain formalities , I suppose . "
28817	28827	28828	28828	he	317	" Well , well ! Tell me about her , "
28839	28844	28828	28828	he	317	" Who saw her ? "
28845	28938	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" I , monsieur . I spoke to her myself . She was on the outside of the station , alone , unprotected , in a state of agitation and alarm . I went up and offered my services . Then she told me she had come from Dijon , that friends who were to have met her had not appeared . I suggested that I should put her into a cab and send her to her destination . But she was afraid of losing her friends , and preferred to wait . "
28939	28960	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" A fine story ! Did she appear to know what had happened ? Had she heard of the murder ? "
28961	28966	28828	28828	he	317	" Something , monsieur . "
28967	28977	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" Who could have told her ? Did you ? "
28978	28987	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" No , not I. But she knew . "
28988	29005	28828	28828	he	317	" Was not that in itself suspicious ? The fact has not yet been made public . "
29006	29051	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" It was in the air , monsieur . There was a general impression that something had happened . That was to be seen on every face , in the whispered talk , the movement to and fro of the police and the guards . "
29052	29064	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" Did she speak of it , or refer to it ? "
29065	29092	28828	28828	he	317	" Only to ask if the murderer was known ; whether the passengers had been detained ; whether there was any inquiry in progress ; and then-- "
29093	29097	28828	28828	he	317	" What then ? "
29098	29102	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" This gentleman , "
29107	29134	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" came out , accompanied by another . They passed pretty close to us , and I noticed that the lady slipped quickly on one side . "
29135	29166	28828	28828	he	317	" She recognized her confederate , of course , but did not wish to be seen just then . Did he , the person with Block here , see her ? "
29167	29194	28828	28828	he	317	" Hardly , I think ; it was all so quick , and they were gone , in a minute , to the cab - stand . "
29195	29202	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" What did your woman do ? "
29203	29235	28828	28828	he	317	" She seemed to have changed her mind all at once , and declared she would not wait for her friends . Now she was in quite a hurry to go . "
29236	29266	28828	28828	he	317	" Of course ! and left you like a fool planted there . I suppose she took a cab and followed the others , Block here and his companion . "
29267	29281	28707	28708	the Chief	247	" I believe she did . I saw her cab close behind theirs . "
29282	29292	29294	29295	the Chief	247	" It is too late to lament this now , "
29307	29354	29294	29295	the Chief	247	" At least it confirms our ideas , and brings us to certain definite conclusions . We must lay hands on these two . Their guilt is all but established . Their own acts condemn them . They must be arrested without a moment 's delay . "
29355	29362	29364	29365	the Judge	485	" If you can find them ! "
29373	29405	29406	29406	Block	60	" That we shall certainly do . Trust to Block , who is very nearly concerned . His future depends on his success . You quite understand that , my man ? "
29418	29507	29406	29406	Block	60	" I do not despair , gentlemen ; and if I might make so bold , sir , I will ask you to assist ? If you would give orders direct from the Prefecture to make the round of the cab - stands , to ask of all the agents in charge the information we need ? Before night we shall have heard from the cabman who drove them what became of this couple , and so get our birds themselves , or a point of fresh departure . "
29508	29519	29595	29598	M. Beaumont le Hardi	75	" And you , Block , where shall you go ? "
29520	29533	29535	29536	the inspector	832	" Where I left him , or rather where he left me , "
29559	29562	29564	29565	M. Floçon	58	" Go , "
29575	29590	29564	29565	M. Floçon	58	" and remember that you have now to justify your retention on the force . "
29606	29627	29600	29601	the Chief	247	" Well , M. le Juge , it promises , I think ; it is all fairly satisfactory , eh ? "
29628	29639	29641	29642	the Judge	485	" I am sorry I can not agree with you , "
29646	29682	29641	29642	the Judge	485	" On the contrary , I consider that we -- or more exactly you , for neither I nor M. Garraud accept any share in it -- you have so far failed , and miserably . "
29683	29696	29698	29699	M. Floçon	58	" Your pardon , M. le Juge , you are too severe , "
29704	29750	29698	29699	M. Floçon	58	" Well ! Look at it from all points of view . What have we got ? What have we gained ? Nothing , or , if anything , it is of the smallest , and it is already jeopardized , if not absolutely lost . "
29751	29767	29600	29601	the Chief	247	" We have at least gained the positive assurance of the guilt of certain individuals . "
29768	29779	29698	29699	M. Floçon	58	" Whom you have allowed to slip through your fingers . "
29780	29808	29698	29699	M. Floçon	58	" Ah , not so , M. le Juge ! We have one under surveillance . My man Galipaud is there at the hotel watching the Countess . "
29809	29822	29825	29826	the Judge	485	" Do not talk to me of your men , M. Floçon , "
29828	29868	29825	29826	the Judge	485	" One of them has given us a touch of his quality . Why should not the other be equally foolish ? I quite expect to hear that the Countess also has gone , that would be the climax ! "
29869	29890	29892	29893	M. Floçon	58	" It shall not happen . I will take the warrant and arrest her now , at once , myself , "
29895	30011	29892	29893	M. Floçon	58	" Well , that will be something , yet not much . Yes , she is only one , and not to my mind the most criminal . We do not know as yet the exact responsibility of each , the exact measure of their guilt ; but I do not myself believe that the Countess was a prime mover , or , indeed , more than an accessory . She was drawn into it , perhaps involved , how or why we can not know , but possibly by fortuitous circumstances that put an unavoidable pressure upon her ; a consenting party , but under protest . That is my view of the lady . "
30037	30091	30029	30029	his	58	" When you again interrogate her , M. le Juge , by the light of your present knowledge , I believe you will think otherwise . She will confess,--you will make her , your skill is unrivalled,--and you will then admit , M. le Juge , that I was right in my suspicions . "
30092	30104	30106	30107	the Judge	485	" Ah , well , produce her ! We shall see , "
30118	30136	30138	30139	the detective	317	" I will bring her to your chamber of instruction within an hour , M. le Juge , "
30222	30227	30229	30230	the General	203	" See , Silas , "
30237	30275	30229	30230	the General	203	" you will have plenty of time for the 11.50 train to Calais for London , but you must hurry up and drive straight across Paris to the Nord . I suppose he can go , Jack ? "
30276	30289	30314	30315	the attaché	727	" Certainly , as he has promised to return if called upon . "
30300	30311	30314	30315	the attaché	727	" But you , General , what are your plans ? "
30317	30370	30314	30315	the attaché	727	" I shall go to the club first , get a room , dress , and all that . Then call at the Hôtel Madagascar . There is a lady there,--one of our party , in fact,--and I should like to ask after her . She may be glad of my services . "
30371	30383	30229	30230	the General	203	" English ? Is there anything we can do for her ? "
30384	30404	30229	30230	the General	203	" Yes , she is an Englishwoman , but the widow of an Italian -- the Contessa di Castagneto . "
30405	30413	30415	30415	Papillon	70	" Oh , but I know her ! "
30417	30472	30415	30415	Papillon	70	" I remember her in Rome two or three years ago . A deuced pretty woman , very much admired , but she was in deep mourning then , and went out very little . I wished she had gone out more . There were lots of men ready to fall at her feet . "
30473	30499	30229	30230	the General	203	" You were in Rome , then , some time back ? Did you ever come across a man there , Quadling , the banker ? "
30500	30553	30229	30230	the General	203	" Of course I did . Constantly . He was a good deal about -- a rather free - living , self - indulgent sort of chap . And now you mention his name , I recollect they said he was much smitten by this particular lady , the Contessa di Castagneto . "
30554	30561	30415	30415	Papillon	70	" And did she encourage him ? "
30562	30616	30229	30230	the General	203	" Lord ! how can I tell ? Who shall say how a woman 's fancy falls ? It might have suited her too . They said she was not in very good circumstances , and he was thought to be a rich man . Of course we know better than that now . "
30617	30623	30229	30230	the General	203	" Why _ now ? _ "
30624	30669	30415	30415	Papillon	70	" Have n't you heard ? It was in the _ Figaro _ yesterday , and in all the Paris papers . Quadling 's bank has gone to smash ; he has bolted with all the ' ready ' he could lay hands upon . "
30670	30679	30681	30682	Sir Charles	56	" He did n't get far , then ! "
30684	30721	30681	30682	Sir Charles	56	" You look surprised , Jack . Did n't they tell you ? This Quadling was the man murdered in the sleeping - car . It was no doubt for the money he carried with him . "
30722	30816	30415	30415	Papillon	70	" Was it Quadling ? My word ! what a terrible Nemesis . Well , _ nil nisi bonum _ , but I never thought much of the chap , and your friend the Countess has had an escape . But now , sir , I must be moving . My engagement is for twelve noon . If you want me , mind you send--207 Rue Miromesnil , or to the Embassy ; but let us arrange to meet this evening , eh ? Dinner and a theatre -- what do you say ? "
31167	31252	31258	31259	Sir Charles	56	" By George , I 'll stick to her through thick and thin ! I 'll trust her whatever happens or has happened , come what may . Such a woman as that is above suspicion . She _ must _ be straight . I should be a beast and a blackguard double distilled to think anything else . I am sure she can put all right with a word , can explain everything when she chooses . I will wait till she does . "
31356	31361	31363	31364	the General	203	" Yes , yes , "
31383	31400	31363	31364	the General	203	" But be so good as to let Madame la Comtesse know that I have called . "
31401	31444	31363	31364	the General	203	" Ah , to be sure ! I came to tell Monsieur le Général that madame will hardly be able to see him . She is indisposed , I believe . At any rate , she does not receive to - day . "
31445	31481	31483	31484	the General	203	" As to that , we shall see . I will take no answer except direct from her . Take or send up my card without further delay . I insist ! Do you hear ? "
31646	31652	31627	31627	He	949	" Castagneto . Contessa Castagneto . "
31676	31680	31682	31683	Sir Charles	56	" Pardon me , "
31695	31711	31682	31683	Sir Charles	56	" I am just going up to see that lady . Give me the telegram . "
31732	31768	31720	31721	the General	203	" No , no , Inspector , you have no earthly right to it . I guess why you are here , but you are not entitled to interfere with private correspondence . Stand back ; "
31779	31800	31775	31775	he	203	" Enough of this . I order you to get out of the way . And be quick about it ! "
31831	31840	31841	31841	she	66	" How truly kind of you to call ! "
31922	31944	31945	31945	he	203	" Of course I came . I thought you might want me , or might like to know the latest news , "
31966	31978	31949	31949	he	203	" Oh , do tell me ! Is there anything fresh ? "
31995	32008	31987	31987	her	66	" This much . They have found out who the man was . "
32009	32020	31949	31949	he	203	" Really ? Positively ? Whom do they say now ? "
32021	32045	31949	31949	he	203	" Perhaps I had better not tell you . It may surprise you , shock you to hear . I think you knew him-- "
32046	32069	31987	31987	her	66	" Nothing can well shock me now . I have had too many shocks already . Who do they think it is ? "
32070	32087	32088	32088	She	66	" A Mr. Quadling , a banker , who is supposed to have absconded from Rome . "
32122	32129	32119	32119	he	956	" You may have already heard ? "
32130	32149	31987	31987	her	66	" Yes ; the police people at the railway station told me they thought it was Mr. Quadling . "
32150	32156	31987	31987	her	66	" But you knew him ? "
32157	32178	32119	32119	he	956	" Certainly . They were my bankers , much to my sorrow . I shall lose heavily by their failure . "
32179	32188	32190	32191	the General	203	" That also has reached you , then ? "
32198	32236	32190	32191	the General	203	" To be sure . The man told me of it himself . Indeed , he came to me the very day I was leaving Rome , and made me an offer -- a most obliging offer . "
32237	32244	32119	32119	he	956	" To share his fallen fortunes ? "
32245	32257	32261	32261	her	958	" Sir Charles Collingham ! How can you ? That creature ! "
32266	32277	32261	32261	her	958	" I had heard -- well , some one said that-- "
32278	32328	32119	32119	he	956	" Speak out , General ; I shall not be offended . I know what you mean . It is perfectly true that the man once presumed to pester me with his attentions . But I would as soon have looked at a courier or a cook . And now-- "
32356	32392	32354	32354	herself	340	" But let me tell you what his offer was . I do n't know why I listened to it . I ought to have at once informed the police . I wish I had . "
32393	32403	32261	32261	her	958	" It might have saved him from his fate . "
32404	32415	32416	32416	she	340	" Every villain gets his deserts in the long run , "
32423	32485	32416	32416	she	340	" And this Mr. Quadling is -- But wait , you shall know him better . He came to me to propose -- what do you think?--that he -- his bank , I mean -- should secretly repay me the amount of my deposit , all the money I had in it . To join me in his fraud , in fact-- "
32486	32510	32261	32261	her	958	" The scoundrel ! Upon my word , he has been well served . And that was the last you saw of him ? "
32511	32541	32542	32542	she	961	" I saw him on the journey , at Turin , at Modane , at -- Oh , Sir Charles , do not ask me any more about him ! "
32558	32573	32542	32542	she	961	" I can not tell you -- I am obliged to -- I -- I-- "
32574	32582	32583	32583	he	962	" Then do not say another word , "
32588	32618	32583	32583	he	962	" There are other things . But my lips are sealed -- at least for the present . You do not -- will not think any worse of me ? "
32659	32722	32654	32654	he	962	" As if anything could make me do that ! Do n't you know -- you may not , but let me assure you , Countess -- that nothing could happen to shake me in the high opinion I have of you . Come what may , I shall trust you , believe in you , think well of you -- always . "
32723	32739	32740	32740	she	961	" How sweet of you to say that ! and now , of all times , "
32804	32819	32820	32820	he	962	" And now -- of all times -- may I say one word more ? "
32826	32854	32820	32820	he	962	" Will you give me the right to shelter and protect you , to stand by you , share your troubles , or keep them from you-- ? "
32855	32867	32868	32868	She	961	" No , no , no , indeed , not now ! "
32882	32918	32919	32919	He	962	" I can not , will not accept this sacrifice . You are only speaking out of your true - hearted chivalry . You must not join yourself to me , you must not involve yourself-- "
33005	33016	33018	33018	herself	961	" My knight -- my own true knight and lord , "
33101	33108	33109	33109	She	961	" Do you know , dearest Countess-- "
33119	33127	33109	33109	She	961	" My name is Sabine -- Charles . "
33128	33165	33222	33222	She	961	" Sabine , darling . It is very prosaic of me , perhaps , but do you know that I am nearly starved ? I came on here at once . I have had no breakfast . "
33166	33171	33172	33172	she	961	" Nor have I , "
33177	33202	33172	33172	she	961	" I was thinking of it when -- when you appeared like a whirlwind , and since then , events have moved so fast . "
33203	33221	33222	33222	She	961	" Are you sorry , Sabine ? Would you rather go back to -- to -- before ? "
33237	33256	33222	33222	She	961	" Not for worlds . But you soldiers -- you are terrible men ! Who can resist you ? "
33257	33302	33172	33172	she	961	" Bah ! It is you who are irresistible . But there , why not put on your jacket and let us go out to lunch somewhere -- Durand 's , Voisin 's , the Café de le Paix ? Which do you prefer ? "
33303	33314	33172	33172	she	961	" I suppose they will not try to stop us ? "
33315	33320	33321	33321	he	56	" Who should try ? "
33324	33376	33321	33321	he	56	" The people of the hotel -- the police -- I can not exactly say whom ; but I dread something of the sort . I do n't quite understand that manager . He has been up to see me several times , and he spoke rather oddly , rather rudely . "
33377	33385	33387	33388	Sir Charles	56	" Then he shall answer for it , "
33392	33412	33387	33388	Sir Charles	56	" It is the fault of that brute of a detective , I suppose . Still they would hardly dare-- "
33413	33425	33321	33321	he	56	" A detective ? What ? Here ? Are you sure ? "
33426	33474	33475	33475	He	56	" Perfectly sure . It is one of those from the Lyons Station . I knew him again directly , and he was inclined to be interfering . Why , I caught him trying -- but that reminds me -- I rescued this telegram from his clutches . "
33504	33507	33475	33475	He	56	" Ah ! "
33532	33538	33539	33539	he	56	" What is the matter ? "
33545	33551	33539	33539	he	56	" May I not know ? "
33576	33624	33552	33552	She	966	" I do not know . I hardly think -- of course I do not like to withhold anything , not now . And yet , this is a business which concerns me only , I am afraid . I ought not to drag you into it . "
33625	33647	33648	33648	She	966	" What concerns you is very much my business , too . I do not wish to force your confidence , still-- "
33711	33763	33708	33708	It	968	" I must see you immediately , and beg you will come . You will find Hortense here . She is giving trouble . You only can deal with her . Do not delay . Come at once , or we must go to you.--Ripaldi , Hôtel Ivoire , Rue Bellechasse . "
33764	33778	33780	33781	Sir Charles	56	" What does this mean ? Who sends it ? Who is Ripaldi ? "
33786	33810	33780	33781	Sir Charles	56	" He -- he -- oh , Charles , I shall have to go . Anything would be better than his coming here . "
33811	33862	33708	33708	It	968	" Ripaldi ? Have n't I heard the name ? He was one of those in the sleeping - car , I think ? The Chief of the Detective Police called it out once or twice . Am I not right ? Please tell me -- am I not right ? "
33863	33887	33708	33708	It	968	" Yes , yes ; this man was there with the rest of us . A dark man , who sat near the door-- "
33888	33944	33780	33781	Sir Charles	56	" Ah , to be sure . But what -- what in Heaven 's name has he to do with you ? How does he dare to send you such an impudent message as this ? Surely , Sabine , you will tell me ? You will admit that I have a right to ask ? "
33945	34002	33708	33708	It	968	" Yes , of course . I will tell you , Charles , everything ; but not here -- not now . It must be on the way . I have been very wrong , very foolish -- but oh , come , come , do let us be going . I am so afraid he might-- "
34003	34018	33708	33708	It	968	" Then I may go with you ? You do not object to that ? "
34019	34033	34034	34034	She	969	" I much prefer it -- much . Do let us make haste ! "
34096	34143	34088	34088	she	969	" And this Hortense ? It is your maid , is it not -- the woman who had taken herself off ? How comes it that she is with that Italian fellow ? Upon my soul , I do n't understand -- not a little bit . "
34144	34177	34178	34178	They	971	" I can not explain that , either . It is most strange , most incomprehensible , but we shall soon know . Please , Charles , please do not get impatient . "
34224	34232	34233	34233	he	970	" Oh , madame , one moment , "
34245	34269	34233	34233	he	970	" The manager wants to speak to you ; he told me to tell you , and stop you if you went out . "
34270	34281	34283	34284	the General	203	" The manager can speak to madame when she returns , "
34292	34305	34283	34284	the General	203	" I have had my orders , and I can not allow her-- "
34306	34313	34315	34316	the General	203	" Stand aside , you scoundrel ! "
34321	34342	34315	34316	the General	203	" or upon my soul I shall give you such a lesson you will be sorry you were ever born . "
34364	34386	34354	34355	the clerk	943	" I was merely giving madame your message , M. Auguste , when this gentleman interposed , threatened me , maltreated me-- "
34387	34398	34399	34400	the manager	873	" Oh , surely not ; it is some mistake ; "
34405	34460	34399	34400	the manager	873	" But certainly I did wish to speak to madame . I wished to ask her whether she was satisfied with her apartment . I find that the rooms she has generally occupied have fallen vacant , in the nick of time . Perhaps madame would like to look at them , and move ? "
34461	34498	34499	34500	The manager	873	" Thank you , M. Auguste , you are very good ; but at another time . I am very much pressed just now . When I return in an hour or two , not now . "
34513	34534	34499	34500	The manager	873	" Oh , as you please , madame . Perfectly . By and by , later , when you choose . "
34641	34657	34617	34622	Some one coming round the corner	987	" Stay ! Stop ! I want to speak to that lady ; detain her . "
34684	34703	34704	34704	she	169	" No , no , no -- don't let them keep me -- I can not wait now , "
34723	34727	34728	34728	he	56	" Go on ! "
34748	34783	34728	34728	he	56	" Forward ! As fast as you can drive . I 'll pay you double fare . Tell him where to go , Sabine . I 'll follow -- in less than no time . "
34843	34856	34839	34839	he	56	" Quick ! After them ! Follow her wherever she goes . Take this,"--he
34866	34890	34839	34839	he	56	" It is a warrant for her arrest . Seize her wherever you find her , and bring her to the Quai l'Horloge , "
34918	34925	34926	34926	he	56	" Now it is between us , "
34931	34943	34926	34926	he	56	" You must account to me for what you have done . "
34944	34948	34950	34951	the General	203	" Must I ? "
34960	34984	34950	34951	the General	203	" It is perfectly easy . Madame was in a hurry , so I helped her to get away . That was all . "
34985	35031	34926	34926	he	56	" You have traversed and opposed the action of the law . You have impeded me , the Chief of the Detective Service , in the execution of my duty . It is not the first time , but now you must answer for it . "
35032	35036	35038	35039	the General	203	" Dear me ! "
35048	35060	35038	35039	the General	203	" You will have to accompany me now to the Prefecture . "
35061	35072	34926	34926	he	56	" And if it does not suit me to go ? "
35073	35108	34926	34926	he	56	" I will have you carried there , bound , tied hand and foot , by the police , like any common rapscallion taken in the act who resists the authority of an officer . "
35109	35134	35038	35039	the General	203	" Oho , you talk very big , sir . Perhaps you will be so obliging as to tell me what I have done . "
35135	35147	34926	34926	he	56	" You have connived at the escape of a criminal from justice-- "
35148	35154	34926	34926	he	56	" That lady ? Psha ! "
35155	35181	35038	35039	the General	203	" She is charged with a heinous crime -- that in which you yourself were implicated -- the murder of that man on the train . "
35182	35212	34926	34926	he	56	" Bah ! You must be a stupid goose , to hint at such a thing ! A lady of birth , breeding , the highest respectability -- impossible ! "
35213	35258	34926	34926	he	56	" All that has not prevented her from allying herself with base , common wretches . I do not say she struck the blow , but I believe she inspired , concerted , approved it , leaving her confederates to do the actual deed . "
35259	35262	35038	35039	the General	203	" Confederates ? "
35263	35285	34926	34926	he	56	" The man Ripaldi , your Italian fellow traveller ; her maid , Hortense Petitpré , who was missing this morning . "
35425	35432	35433	35433	he	203	" Come , M. le Général , "
35443	35527	35433	35433	he	203	" I can see how it is with you , and you have my sincere sympathy . We are all of us liable to be carried away , and there is much excuse for you in this . But now -- believe me , I am justified in saying it --now I tell you that our case is strong against her , that it is not mere speculation , but supported by facts . Now surely you will come over to our side ? "
35528	35533	35619	35620	the General	203	" In what way ? "
35534	35557	35694	35694	he	247	" Tell us frankly all you know -- where that lady has gone , help us to lay our hands on her . "
35558	35576	35433	35433	he	203	" Your own people will do that . I heard you order that man to follow her . "
35577	35607	35619	35620	the General	203	" Probably ; still I would rather have the information from you . It would satisfy me of your good - will . I need not then proceed to extremities-- "
35608	35617	35619	35620	the General	203	" I certainly shall not give it you , "
35624	35657	35619	35620	the General	203	" Anything I know about or have heard from the Contessa Castagneto is sacred ; besides , I still believe in her -- thoroughly . Nothing you have said can shake me . "
35658	35682	35683	35684	The Chief	247	" Then I must ask you to accompany me to the Prefecture . You will come , I trust , on my invitation . "
35704	35720	35694	35694	he	247	" Meaning that if I do not , you will have resort to something stronger ? "
35721	35737	35619	35620	the General	203	" That will be quite unnecessary , I am sure,--at least I hope so . Still-- "
35738	35778	35694	35694	he	247	" I will go where you like , only I will tell you nothing more , not a single word ; and before I start , I must let my friends at the Embassy know where to find me . "
35779	35787	35794	35794	his	697	" Oh , with all my heart , "
35797	35821	35794	35794	his	697	" We will call there on our way , and you can tell the porter . They will know where to find us . "
35920	35930	35910	35910	his	203	" Kindly let Colonel Papillon have that without delay . "
35939	35962	35931	35932	The General	203	" I have got into fresh trouble . Come on to me at the Police Prefecture if you can spare the time . "
35963	35977	35979	35980	the porter	155	" The Colonel is now in the Chancery : will not monsieur wait ? "
36003	36024	35987	35988	the detective	317	" No . It is impossible . We are going to the Quai l'Horloge . It is an urgent matter . "
36063	36067	36070	36071	the porter	155	" Very well ! "
36101	36111	36113	36114	Sir Charles	56	" Does this mean that I am a prisoner ? "
36125	36148	36150	36151	the detective	317	" It means , monsieur , that you are in the hands of justice until your recent conduct has been fully explained , "
36160	36164	36150	36151	the detective	317	" But I protest-- "
36165	36190	36191	36192	The General	203	" I wish to hear no further observations , monsieur . You may reserve them till you can give them to the right person . "
36344	36349	36355	36355	he	58	" It is here ! "
36363	36366	36355	36355	he	58	" Enter . "
36401	36404	36406	36407	the Chief	247	" Baume , "
36411	36424	36406	36407	the Chief	247	" I wish to leave this gentleman with you . Make him at home,"--the
36430	36456	36457	36458	Sir Charles	56	irony,--"and when I call you , bring him at once to my cabinet . You , monsieur , you will oblige me by staying here . "
36619	36627	36613	36614	M. Baume	122	" I wish to have no talk ; "
36665	36669	36657	36657	Baume	122	" Not allowed . "
36670	36690	36692	36693	the General	203	" Then I 'll be hanged if I do n't smoke in spite of every man jack of you ! "
36707	36712	36714	36714	Baume	122	" What 's that ? "
36943	36946	36912	36912	he	203	" Come . "
37016	37092	36988	36991	M. Beaumont le Hardi	75	" You will , I trust , pardon us , M. le Général , for having detained you here and so long . But there were , as we thought , good and sufficient reasons . If those have now lost some of their cogency , we still stand by our action as having been justifiable in the execution of our duty . We are now willing to let you go free , because -- because-- "
37093	37107	37110	37111	the detective	317	" We have caught the person , the lady you helped to escape , "
37120	37133	37110	37111	the detective	317	" The Countess ? Is she here , in custody ? Never ! "
37134	37148	37151	37152	M. Floçon	58	" Undoubtedly she is in custody , and in very close custody too , "
37156	37188	37151	37152	M. Floçon	58	" _ Au secret _ , if you know what that means -- in a cell separate and apart , where no one is permitted to see or speak to her . "
37189	37221	37110	37111	the detective	317	" Surely not that ? Jack -- Papillon -- this must not be . I beg of you , implore , insist , that you will get his lordship to interpose . "
37222	37247	37110	37111	the detective	317	" But , sir , how can I ? You must not ask impossibilities . The Contessa Castagneto is really an Italian subject now . "
37248	37288	37290	37291	the General	203	" She is English by birth , and whether or no , she is a woman , a high - bred lady ; and it is abominable , unheard - of , to subject her to such monstrous treatment , "
37293	37320	37290	37291	the General	203	" But these gentlemen declare that they are fully warranted , that she has put herself in the wrong -- greatly , culpably in the wrong . "
37321	37328	37330	37331	the General	203	" I do n't believe it ! "
37335	37364	37330	37331	the General	203	" Not from these chaps , a pack of idiots , always on the wrong tack ! I do n't believe a word , not if they swear . "
37365	37381	37290	37291	the General	203	" But they have documentary evidence -- papers of the most damaging kind against her . "
37382	37387	37290	37291	the General	203	" Where ? How ? "
37388	37404	37406	37407	the General	203	" He -- M. le Juge -- has been showing me a note - book ; "
37451	37534	37446	37447	the Judge	485	" It is easy to perceive that you protest , M. le Général , against that lady 's arrest . Is it so ? Well , we are not called upon to justify it to you , not in the very least . But we are dealing with a brave man , a gentleman , an officer of high rank and consideration , and you shall know things that we are not bound to tell , to you or to any one . "
37535	37538	37539	37539	he	485	" First , "
37549	37564	37539	37539	he	485	" do you know what this is ? Have you ever seen it before ? "
37565	37584	37446	37447	the Judge	485	" I am dimly conscious of the fact , and yet I can not say when or where . "
37585	37602	37446	37447	the Judge	485	" It is the property of one of your fellow travellers -- an Italian called Ripaldi . "
37603	37606	37608	37609	the General	203	" Ripaldi ? "
37630	37637	37616	37616	he	203	" Ah ! now I understand . "
37638	37651	37653	37654	the Judge	485	" You had heard of it , then ? In what connection ? "
37668	37673	37675	37676	the General	203	" I now understand , "
37683	37715	37675	37676	the General	203	" why the note - book was familiar to me . I had seen it in that man 's hands in the waiting - room . He was writing in it . "
37716	37779	37616	37616	he	203	" Indeed ? A favourite occupation evidently . He was fond of confiding in that note - book , and committed to it much that he never expected would see the light -- his movements , intentions , ideas , even his inmost thoughts . The book -- which he no doubt lost inadvertently is very incriminating to himself and his friends . "
37780	37786	37789	37790	Sir Charles	56	" What do you imply ? "
37792	37832	37789	37790	Sir Charles	56	" Simply that it is on that which is written here that we base one part , perhaps the strongest , of our case against the Countess . It is strangely but convincingly corroborative of our suspicions against her . "
37833	37842	37845	37846	the General	203	" May I look at it for myself ? "
37854	37878	37880	37881	the Judge	485	" It is in Italian . Perhaps you can read that language ? If not , I have translated the most important passages , "
37888	37907	37880	37881	the Judge	485	" Thank you ; if you will permit me , I should prefer to look at the original ; "
38063	38081	38147	38147	X.	127	" Jan. 11 . To call at Café di Roma , 12.30 . Beppo will meet me . "
38100	38131	38224	38224	Q.	129	" Jan. 15 . There is trouble brewing at the Circulo Bonafede ; Louvaih , Malatesta , and the Englishman Sprot , have joined it . All are noted Anarchists . "
38158	38179	38147	38147	X.	127	" Jan. 23 . Ordered to watch Q. Could I work him ? No . Strong doubts of his solvency . "
38193	38220	38147	38147	X.	127	" Feb. 27 . Q. keeps up good appearance . Any mistake ? Shall I try him ? Sorely pressed . X. threatens me with Prefettura . "
38240	38253	38147	38147	X.	127	" March 3 . Q. means mischief . Preparing for a start ? "
38267	38341	38147	38147	X.	127	" Then followed a brief account of Quadling 's movements on the day before his departure from Rome , very much as they have been described in a previous chapter . These were made mostly in the form of reflections , conjectures , hopes , and fears ; hurry - scurry of pursuit had no doubt broken the immediate record of events , and these had been entered next day in the train . "
38385	38420	38377	38377	I	0	" 12.30 . Breakfasted at Turin . Q. did not come to table . Found him hanging about outside restaurant . Spoke ; got short reply . Wishes to avoid observation , I suppose . "
38474	38530	38470	38470	they	1089	" At Modane he came to the Douane , and afterwards into the restaurant . He bowed across the table to the lady . She hardly recognized him , which is odd . Of course she must know him ; then why-- ? There is something between them , and the maid is in it . "
38561	38733	38552	38552	they	1089	" So am I ; I have the best right to it , for I can do most for him . He is absolutely in my power , and he 'll see that -- he 's no fool-- directly he knows who I am , and why I 'm here . It will be worth his while to buy me off , if I 'm ready to sell myself , and my duty , and the Prefettura -- and why should n't I ? What better can I do ? Shall I ever have such a chance again ? Twenty , thirty , forty thousand lire , more , even , at one stroke ; why , it 's a fortune ! I could go to the Republic , to America , North or South , send for Mariuccia-- no , _ cos petto ! _ I will continue free ! I will spend the money on myself , as I alone will have earned it , and at such risk . "
38741	38817	38734	38734	I	0	" I will go to him at the very last , just before we are reaching Paris . Tell him , threaten him with arrest , then give him his chance of escape . No fear that he wo n't accept it ; he _ must _ , whatever he may have settled with the others . _ Altro ! _ I snap my fingers at them . He has most to fear from me . "
38860	38901	38552	38552	they	1089	" Ugh ! I am still trembling with horror and fear . I can not get it out of my mind ; I never shall . Why , what tempted me ? How could I bring myself to do it ? "
38987	39080	38976	38977	the fiend	1095	" And now she has me in her power ! But have I not her also ? We are in the same boat -- we must sink or swim , together . We are equally bound , I to her , she to me . What are we to do ? How shall we meet inquiry ? _ Santissima Donna ! _ why did I not risk it , and climb out like the maid ? It was terrible for the moment , but the worst would have been over , and now-- "
39114	39173	38976	38977	the fiend	1095	" I must attract her attention . She will not look my way . I want her to understand that I have something special to say to her , and that , as we are forbidden to speak , I am writing it herein -- that she must contrive to take the book from me and read unobserved . "
39199	39210	39211	39211	Countess	1099	" Now followed what the police deemed such damaging evidence . "
39381	39465	39361	39362	Grand Hôtel	133	" This ended the writing in the note - book , and the whole perusal occupied Sir Charles from fifteen to twenty minutes , during which the French officials watched his face closely , and his friend Colonel Papillon anxiously . But the General 's mask was impenetrable , and at the end of his reading he turned back to read and re - read many pages , holding the book to the light , and seeming to examine the contents very curiously . "
39468	39483	39361	39362	Grand Hôtel	133	" said the Judge at last , when he met the General 's eye . "
39493	39504	39485	39485	you	1104	" asked the General in a calm , dispassionate voice . "
39521	39522	39485	39485	you	1104	" "
39552	39553	39543	39543	I	0	" "
39556	39561	39543	39543	I	0	" interposed the detective ; "
39582	39583	39586	39586	sir	1255	" "
39588	39597	39586	39586	sir	1255	" said the General , raising his hand . "
39626	39627	39599	39599	you	1255	" "
39637	39672	39677	39677	yourselves	1255	" cried both the officials in a breath . They saw at once that if this discovery were admitted to be an absolute fact , the whole drift of their conclusions must be changed . "
39691	39696	39697	39697	I	0	" insisted Sir Charles . "
39715	39751	39752	39752	I	0	" For several minutes both the Judge and the detective pored over the note - book , examining page after page , shaking their heads , and declining to accept the evidence of their eyes . "
39758	39768	39752	39752	I	0	" said the Judge at last ; adding reluctantly , "
39783	39784	39752	39752	I	0	" "
39788	39794	39752	39752	I	0	" put in M. Floçon . "
39850	39851	39843	39843	he	1107	" "
39868	39874	39863	39863	he	1107	" further remarked the Judge . "
39886	39893	39875	39875	You	1109	" argued the General , shrewdly . "
39971	39972	39961	39962	an expert	1111	" "
39977	39986	39961	39962	an expert	1111	" said the Judge , after a pause , "
40007	40008	40003	40003	you	1112	" "
40022	40030	40031	40031	I	0	" said Sir Charles , rather disdainfully . "
40053	40054	40051	40051	You	1109	" "
40058	40063	40051	40051	You	1109	" corrected the General . "
40140	40141	40135	40135	he	73	" "
40152	40159	40143	40143	you	1109	" interjected M. Floçon , fiercely . "
40180	40181	40178	40178	Ripaldi	73	" "
40231	40232	40210	40210	I	0	" "
40245	40254	40236	40237	the others	1394	" went on the Judge , greatly puzzled . "
40268	40269	40270	40270	I	0	" "
40280	40286	40270	40270	I	0	" stoutly maintained Sir Charles , "
40295	40296	40291	40291	I	0	" "
40332	40333	40366	40366	Ripaldi	73	" "
40344	40345	40366	40366	Ripaldi	73	" "
40358	40359	40350	40350	he	73	" "
40403	40404	40405	40405	You	1109	" "
40431	40449	40416	40418	M. le Général	77	" cried the Judge , and only professional jealousy prevented M. Floçon from conceding the same praise . "
40460	40481	40455	40455	I	0	" asked Colonel Papillon in amazement . His wits did not travel quite so fast as those of his companions . "
40489	40494	40487	40487	Jack	95	" explained the General : "
40573	40574	40564	40565	these gentlemen	2156	" "
40580	40587	40564	40565	these gentlemen	2156	" said the Judge , heartily . "
40648	40661	40643	40644	M. Floçon	58	" The detective hung his head in guilty admission of this reproach . "
40673	40680	40662	40662	We	1127	" said Sir Charles , pleasantly . "
40709	40710	40696	40696	He	1335	" "
40717	40735	40696	40696	He	1335	" the detective touched a bell , and briefly ordered two fiacres to the door at once . "
40743	40748	40740	40741	M. Floçon	58	" said the Judge . "
40773	40774	40771	40771	monsieur	1266	" "
40788	40794	40796	40796	you	58	" went on M. Floçon . "
40809	40810	40796	40796	you	58	" "
40857	40858	40854	40854	I	0	" "
40866	40867	40868	40870	The woman Hortense	1137	" "
40882	40883	40868	40870	The woman Hortense	1137	" "
40889	40896	40886	40886	you	58	" began the detective , suspiciously . "
40899	40904	40886	40886	you	58	" interrupted the Judge ; "
40929	40930	40922	40923	the General	203	" "
40943	40949	40939	40939	you	58	" went on Sir Charles . "
40993	40994	40986	40986	you	58	" "
41011	41015	41010	41010	my	0	duty"--protested the Judge . "
41040	41041	41034	41034	I	0	" "
41049	41050	41044	41044	you	0	" "
41072	41175	41058	41058	I	0	" The Judge yielded , smiling at the General 's urgency , and shrewdly guessing what it implied . Then the three departures from the Prefecture took place within a short time of each other . A posse of police went to arrest Ripaldi ; the Countess returned to the Hotel Madagascar ; and the Judge 's party started for the Morgue,--only a short journey,--where they were presently received with every mark of respect and consideration . The keeper , or officer in charge , was summoned , and came out bareheaded to the fiacre , bowing low before his distinguished visitors . "
41182	41191	41179	41180	La Pêche	134	" said M. Floçon in a sharp voice . "
41220	41221	41226	41226	your	134	" "
41231	41239	41229	41229	Chief	1607	" replied the old man , obsequiously . "
41272	41442	41267	41270	many people in yonder	1150	" It was the usual crowd of sightseers passing slowly before the plate glass of this , the most terrible shop - front in the world , where the goods exposed , the merchandise , are hideous corpses laid out in rows upon the marble slabs , the battered , tattered remnants of outraged humanity , insulted by the most terrible indignities in death . Who make up this curious throng , and what strange morbid motives drag them there ? Those fat , comfortable - looking women , with their baskets on their arms ; the decent workmen in dusty blouses , idling between the hours of work ; the riffraff of the streets , male or female , in various stages of wretchedness and degradation ? A few , no doubt , are impelled by motives we can not challenge -- they are torn and tortured by suspense , trembling lest they may recognize missing dear ones among the exposed ; others stare carelessly at the day 's "
41445	41571	41267	41270	many people in yonder	1150	" wondering , perhaps , if they may come to the same fate ; one or two are idle sightseers , not always French , for the Morgue is a favourite haunt with the irrepressible tourist doing Paris . Strangest of all , the murderer himself , the doer of the fell deed , comes here , to the very spot where his victim lies stark and reproachful , and stares at it spellbound , fascinated , filled more with remorse , perchance , than fear at the risk he runs . So common is this trait , that in mysterious murder cases the police of Paris keep a disguised officer among the crowd at the Morgue , and have thereby made many memorable arrests . "
41580	41755	41267	41270	many people in yonder	1150	" and the keeper of the Morgue led the party through one or two rooms into the inner and back recesses of the buildings . It was behind the scenes of the Morgue , and they were made free of its most gruesome secrets as they passed along . The temperature had suddenly fallen far below freezing - point , and the icy cold chilled to the very marrow . Still worse was an all - pervading , acrid odour of artificially suspended animal decay . The cold - air process , that latest of scientific contrivances to arrest the waste of tissue , has now been applied at the Morgue to preserve and keep the bodies fresh , and allow them to be for a longer time exposed than when running water was the only aid . There are , moreover , many specially contrived refrigerating chests , in which those still unrecognized corpses are laid by for months , to be dragged out , if needs be , like carcasses of meat . "
41761	41766	41267	41270	many people in yonder	1150	" cried Sir Charles . "
41784	41785	41267	41270	many people in yonder	1150	" "
41791	41802	41805	41809	the third from the left	1156	" quickly asked Colonel Papillon in response to this appeal . "
41811	41816	41805	41809	the third from the left	1156	" whispered M. Floçon . "
41827	41828	41819	41819	you	1574	" "
41858	41859	41850	41851	any one	1352	" "
41879	41889	41902	41902	him	91	" asked the Judge in a greatly disappointed tone . "
41909	41910	41902	41902	him	91	" "
41918	41919	41920	41923	That Quadling in person	1158	" "
41932	41950	41920	41923	That Quadling in person	1158	" M. Floçon was the first to realize the full meaning of Colonel Papillon 's surprising statement . "
41971	41972	41920	41923	That Quadling in person	1158	" "
41978	42000	41976	41976	gentlemen	1245	" he went on , and he hustled his companions with frantic haste out at the back of the mortuary chamber . "
42021	42067	42009	42009	He	91	" Then with no less haste he seized Colonel Papillon by the arm and hurried him by the back passages through the office into the outer , public chamber , where the astonished crowd stood , silent and perturbed , awaiting explanation of their detention . "
42072	42077	42079	42079	him	91	" whispered the Chief ; "
42084	42111	42079	42079	him	91	" The request was not unnecessary , for when Colonel Papillon went forward , and , putting his hand on a man 's shoulder , saying , "
42118	42256	42112	42113	Mr. Quadling	91	" the police officer was scarcely able to restrain his surprise . The person thus challenged was very unlike any one he had seen before that day , Ripaldi most of all . The moustache was gone , the clothes were entirely changed ; a pair of dark green spectacles helped the disguise . It was strange indeed that Papillon had known him ; but at the moment of recognition Quadling had removed his glasses , no doubt that he might the better examine the object of his visit to the Morgue , that gruesome record of his own fell handiwork . Naturally he drew back with well - feigned indignation , muttering half - unintelligible words in French , denying stoutly both in voice and gesture all acquaintance with the person who thus abruptly addressed him . "
42264	42268	42112	42113	Mr. Quadling	91	" he cried . "
42274	42275	42271	42271	you	91	" "
42280	42287	42271	42271	you	91	" quietly put in M. Floçon ; "
42314	42334	42305	42305	I	0	" There was no escaping now , and with a poor attempt at bravado the stranger was led away . "
42355	42356	42357	42358	Mr. Quadling	91	" "
42382	42383	42377	42377	him	1167	" "
42392	42397	42390	42390	sir	1255	" This to Quadling . "
42447	42628	42434	42435	La Pêche	134	" They gave the wretched man but scant consideration , and in less than three minutes had visited every pocket , examined every secret receptacle , and practically turned him inside out . After this there could no longer be any doubt of his identity , still less of his complicity in the crime . First among the many damning evidences of his guilt was the missing pocketbook of the porter of the sleeping - car . Within was the train card and the passengers ' tickets , all the papers which the man Groote had lost so unaccountably . They had , of course , been stolen from his person with the obvious intention of impeding the inquiry into the murder . Next , in another inner pocket was Quadling 's own wallet , with his own visiting - cards , several letters addressed to him by name ; above all , a thick sheaf of bank - notes of all nationalities -- English , French , Italian , and amounting in total value to several thousands of pounds . "
42677	42684	42667	42667	we	1171	" said the Judge , severely . "
42693	42728	42689	42689	you	0	" But Quadling , with pale , averted face , stood obstinately mute . He was in the toils , the net had closed round him , they should have no assistance from him . "
42747	42748	42750	42750	you	0	" "
42765	42766	42750	42750	you	0	" "
42788	42834	42836	42836	you	0	" Without more ado a fiacre was called , and the prisoner was taken off under escort , M. Floçon seated by his side , one policeman in front , another on the box , and lodged in a secret cell at the Quai l'Horloge . "
42840	42851	42836	42836	you	0	" said the Judge to Sir Charles and Colonel Papillon . "
42883	42938	42939	42939	I	0	" Sir Charles was eager to return to the Hôtel Madagascar , and yet he felt that he should best serve his dear Countess by seeing this to the end . So he readily assented to accompany the Judge , and Colonel Papillon , who was no less curious , agreed to go too . "
42943	42951	42939	42939	I	0	" said the Judge on the way , "
43000	43127	43130	43134	a man calling himself Dufour	1179	" During the events just recorded , which occupied a good hour , the police agents had time to go and come from the Rue Bellechasse . They did not return empty - handed , although at first it seemed as if they had made a fruitless journey . The Hôtel Ivoire was a very second - class place , a lodging - house , or hotel with furnished rooms let out by the week to lodgers with whom the proprietor had no very close acquaintance . His clerk did all the business , and this functionary produced the register , as he is bound by law , for the inspection of the police officers , but afforded little information as to the day 's arrivals . "
43163	43179	43160	43160	he	1179	" and he went on at the request of the police officers to describe them . "
43183	43191	43160	43160	he	1179	" said the senior agent , briefly . "
43203	43204	43199	43201	the detective police	2077	" "
43208	43218	43199	43201	the detective police	2077	" Such visits were not new to the clerk . "
43264	43279	43239	43239	she	135	" He looked up at the furiously oscillating bell , but made no move . "
43298	43299	43290	43290	her	135	" "
43308	43352	43303	43303	we	1182	" said the officer , making for the stairs and the room indicated . But on reaching the door , they found it locked . From within ? Hardly , for as they stood there in doubt , a voice inside cried vehemently : "
43379	43380	43381	43381	We	1182	" "
43435	43501	43502	43503	Madame Dufour	135	" The key was quickly produced , and an entrance effected . A woman stood there in a defiant attitude , with arms akimbo ; she , no doubt , of whom they were in search . A tall , rather masculine - looking creature , with a dark , handsome face , bold black eyes just now flashing fiercely , rage in every feature . "
43505	43511	43502	43503	Madame Dufour	135	" began the police officer . "
43531	43536	43524	43524	you	135	" ( Police . ) "
43569	43570	43571	43571	I	0	" "
43612	43696	43697	43697	She	1197	" In the fiacre Hortense Petitpré talked on with such incessant abuse , virulent and violent , of Quadling , that her charges were neither precise nor intelligible . It was not until she appeared before M. Beaumont le Hardi , and was handled with great dexterity by that practised examiner , that her story took definite form . What she had to say will be best told in the clear , formal language of the official disposition . The witness inculpated stated : "
43773	43820	43759	43762	the Sieur Francis Quadling	91	" Quadling had pretensions to the hand of the Countess , and sought , by bribes and entreaties , to interest witness in his suit . Witness often spoke of him in complimentary terms to her mistress , who was not very favourably disposed towards him . "
43884	43946	43947	43947	Witness	138	" Witness was much surprised to find him in the sleeping - car , but had no talk to him till the following morning , when he asked her to obtain an interview for him with the Countess , and promised a large reward . In making this offer he produced a wallet and exhibited a very large number of notes . "
43980	44104	44105	44105	Witness	138	" During the journey witness thought much over the situation . Admitted that the sight of Quadling 's money had greatly disturbed her , but , although pressed , would not say when the first idea of robbing him took possession of her . ( Note by Judge -- That she had resolved to do so is , however , perfectly clear , and the conclusion is borne out by her acts . It was she who secured the Countess 's medicine bottle ; she , beyond doubt , who drugged the porter at Laroche . In no other way can her presence in the sleeping - car between Laroche and Paris be accounted for - presence which she does not deny . ) "
44158	44174	44175	44175	Witness	2314	" She saw it struck , and saw the victim fall lifeless on the floor . "
44244	44330	44220	44222	the man Quadling	1131	" Witness at last prevailed on him to spare her life , but only on condition that she would leave the car . He indicated the window as the only way of escape ; but on this for a long time she refused to venture , declaring that it was only to exchange one form of death for another . Then , as Quadling again threatened to stab her , she was compelled to accept this last chance , never hoping to win out alive . "
44393	44583	44378	44378	he	91	" Witness descended from the train not far from the small station of Villeneuve on the line , and there took the local train for Paris . Landed at the Lyons Station , she heard of the inquiry in progress , and then , waiting outside , saw Quadling disguised as the Italian leave in company with another man . She followed and marked Quadling down , meaning to denounce him on the first opportunity . Quadling , however , on issuing from the restaurant , had accosted her , and at once offered her a further sum of five thousand francs as the price of silence , and she had gone with him to the Hôtel Ivoire , where she was to receive the sum . Quadling had paid it , but on one condition , that she would remain at the Hotel Ivoire until the following day . Apparently he had distrusted her , for he had contrived to lock her into her compartment . As she did not choose to be so imprisoned , she summoned assistance , and was at length released by the police . "
45008	45043	44984	44988	the depositors in the bank	1226	" Yesterday , at the British Embassy , General Sir Charles Collingham , K. C. B. , was married to Sabine , Contessa di Castagneto , widow of the Italian Count of that name . "
