1080	1111	1077	1077	his	337	“ Why , save the man , what wisdom 's in him that ' a should come to Weydon for a job of that sort this time o ' year ? ”
1112	1134	1136	1137	the other	338	“ Then is there any house to let — a little small new cottage just a builded , or such like ? ”
1146	1196	1139	1140	The pessimist	339	“ Pulling down is more the nater of Weydon . There were five houses cleared away last year , and three this ; and the volk nowhere to go — no , not so much as a thatched hurdle ; that 's the way o ' Weydon - Priors . ”
1220	1234	1217	1217	he	337	“ There is something going on here , however , is there not ? ”
1235	1303	1217	1217	he	337	“ Ay . ' Tis Fair Day . Though what you hear now is little more than the clatter and scurry of getting away the money o ' children and fools , for the real business is done earlier than this . I 've been working within sound o't all day , but I did n't go up — not I. ' Twas no business of mine . ”
1570	1582	1641	1642	the woman	300	“ Good Home - brewed Beer , Ale , and Cyder . ”
1609	1615	1616	1617	The man	291	“ Good Furmity Sold Hear . ”
1630	1639	1641	1642	the woman	300	“ No — no — the other one , ”
1644	1671	1641	1642	the woman	300	“ I always like furmity ; and so does Elizabeth - Jane ; and so will you . It is nourishing after a long hard day . ”
1672	1679	1681	1682	the man	291	“ I 've never tasted it , ”
2227	2251	2217	2218	the wife	321	“ Michael , how about our lodging ? You know we may have trouble in getting it if we do n't go soon . ”
2437	2446	2448	2449	the trusser	341	“ I did for myself that way thoroughly , ”
2461	2481	2482	2482	He	341	“ I married at eighteen , like the fool that I was ; and this is the consequence o't . ”
2570	2645	2566	2567	The man	291	“ I have n't more than fifteen shillings in the world , and yet I am a good experienced hand in my line . I 'd challenge England to beat me in the fodder business ; and if I were a free man again I 'd be worth a thousand pound before I 'd done o't . But a fellow never knows these little things till all chance of acting upon 'em is past . ”
2661	2742	2566	2567	The man	291	“ Now this is the last lot — now who 'll take the last lot for a song ? Shall I say forty shillings ? ' Tis a very promising broodmare , a trifle over five years old , and nothing the matter with the hoss at all , except that she 's a little holler in the back and had her left eye knocked out by the kick of another , her own sister , coming along the road . ”
2743	2778	2780	2784	the man in the tent	402	“ For my part I do n't see why men who have got wives and do n't want 'em , should n't get rid of 'em as these gipsy fellows do their old horses , ”
2786	2827	2780	2784	the man in the tent	402	“ Why should n't they put 'em up and sell 'em by auction to men who are in need of such articles ? Hey ? Why , begad , I 'd sell mine this minute if anybody would buy her ! ”
2828	2837	2838	2841	some of the guests	403	“ There 's them that would do that , ”
2858	2861	2863	2865	a smoking gentleman	406	“ True , ”
2927	2946	2947	2947	he	406	“ I 've had my breedings in as good circles , I may say , as any man , ”
2950	2998	2947	2947	he	406	“ and I know true cultivation , or nobody do ; and I can declare she 's got it — in the bone , mind ye , I say — as much as any female in the fair — though it may want a little bringing out . ”
3069	3092	3057	3057	he	406	“ Well , then , now is your chance ; I am open to an offer for this gem o ' creation . ”
3101	3131	3093	3093	She	380	“ Michael , you have talked this nonsense in public places before . A joke is a joke , but you may make it once too often , mind ! ”
3132	3152	3093	3093	She	380	“ I know I 've said it before ; I meant it . All I want is a buyer . ”
3290	3317	3318	3319	The company	388	“ Here — I am waiting to know about this offer of mine . The woman is no good to me . Who 'll have her ? ”
3349	3381	3343	3343	she	300	“ Come , come , it is getting dark , and this nonsense wo n't do . If you do n't come along , I shall go without you . Come ! ”
3410	3435	3396	3397	the man	291	“ I asked this question , and nobody answered to ' t. Will any Jack Rag or Tom Straw among ye buy my goods ? ”
3458	3463	3464	3464	she	300	“ Mike , Mike , ”
3467	3479	3464	3464	she	300	“ this is getting serious . O ! — too serious ! ”
3480	3486	3488	3489	the man	291	“ Will anybody buy her ? ”
3491	3497	3499	3499	she	300	“ I wish somebody would , ”
3502	3514	3499	3499	she	300	“ Her present owner is not at all to her liking ! ”
3515	3521	3523	3523	he	291	“ Nor you to mine , ”
3525	3590	3523	3523	he	291	“ So we are agreed about that . Gentlemen , you hear ? It 's an agreement to part . She shall take the girl if she wants to , and go her ways . I 'll take my tools , and go my ways . ' Tis simple as Scripture history . Now then , stand up , Susan , and show yourself . ”
3591	3598	3600	3606	a buxom staylace dealer in voluminous petticoats	425	“ Do n't , my chiel , ”
3614	3626	3627	3628	The woman	300	“ yer good man do n't know what he 's saying . ”
3636	3643	3645	3648	the hay - trusser	428	“ Now , who 's auctioneer ? ”
3650	3654	3645	3648	the hay - trusser	428	“ I be , ”
3680	3690	3691	3692	The woman	300	“ Who 'll make an offer for this lady ? ”
3711	3715	3717	3717	someone	431	“ Five shillings , ”
3726	3730	3732	3733	the husband	432	“ No insults , ”
3735	3742	3732	3733	the husband	432	“ Who 'll say a guinea ? ”
3754	3795	3747	3751	the female dealer in staylaces	434	“ Behave yerself moral , good man , for Heaven 's love ! Ah , what a cruelty is the poor soul married to ! Bed and board is dear at some figures ' pon my ' vation ' tis ! ”
3796	3803	3805	3806	the trusser	341	“ Set it higher , auctioneer , ”
3808	3812	3814	3815	the auctioneer	436	“ Two guineas ! ”
3822	3842	3844	3845	the husband	432	“ If they do n't take her for that , in ten seconds they 'll have to give more , ”
3847	3857	3844	3845	the husband	432	“ Very well . Now auctioneer , add another . ”
3858	3867	3869	3871	the rheumy man	439	“ Three guineas — going for three guineas ! ”
3873	3877	3879	3880	the husband	432	“ No bid ? ”
3882	3903	3879	3880	the husband	432	“ Good Lord , why she 's cost me fifty times the money , if a penny . Go on . ”
3904	3908	3910	3911	the auctioneer	436	“ Four guineas ! ”
3913	3930	3932	3933	the husband	432	“ I 'll tell ye what — I wo n't sell her for less than five , ”
3945	4008	4009	4009	She	443	“ I 'll sell her for five guineas to any man that will pay me the money , and treat her well ; and he shall have her for ever , and never hear aught o ' me . But she sha n't go for less . Now then — five guineas — and she 's yours . Susan , you agree ? ”
4017	4021	4023	4024	the auctioneer	436	“ Five guineas , ”
4026	4046	4023	4024	the auctioneer	436	“ or she 'll be withdrawn . Do anybody give it ? The last time . Yes or no ? ”
4047	4050	3932	3933	the husband	432	“ Yes , ”
4105	4111	4113	4114	the husband	432	“ You say you do ? ”
4120	4125	4127	4128	the sailor	449	“ I say so , ”
4130	4146	4147	4148	The sailor	449	“ Saying is one thing , and paying is another . Where 's the money ? ”
4399	4402	4404	4405	the woman	300	“ Now , ”
4421	4457	4404	4405	the woman	300	“ before you go further , Michael , listen to me . If you touch that money , I and this girl go with the man . Mind , it is a joke no longer . ”
4458	4470	4475	4475	his	387	“ A joke ? Of course it is not a joke ! ”
4482	4509	4475	4475	his	387	“ I take the money ; the sailor takes you . That 's plain enough . It has been done elsewhere — and why not here ? ”
4510	4524	4526	4527	the sailor	449	“ ' Tis quite on the understanding that the young woman is willing , ”
4530	4541	4526	4527	the sailor	449	“ I would n't hurt her feelings for the world . ”
4542	4548	4550	4551	her husband	387	“ Faith , nor I , ”
4553	4578	4550	4551	her husband	387	“ But she is willing , provided she can have the child . She said so only the other day when I talked o't ! ”
4579	4584	4586	4587	the sailor	449	“ That you swear ? ”
4591	4595	4597	4597	she	300	“ I do , ”
4612	4628	4630	4631	the trusser	341	“ Very well , she shall have the child , and the bargain 's complete , ”
4671	4675	4676	4676	he	449	“ Come along ! ”
4680	4691	4676	4676	he	449	“ The little one too — the more the merrier ! ”
4758	4761	4762	4762	she	300	“ Mike , ”
4765	4816	4762	4762	she	300	“ I 've lived with thee a couple of years , and had nothing but temper ! Now I 'm no more to ' ee ; I 'll try my luck elsewhere . ' Twill be better for me and Elizabeth - Jane , both . So good - bye ! ”
4877	4882	4883	4883	he	432	“ Is she gone ? ”
4886	4897	4899	4903	some rustics near the door	479	“ Faith , ay ! she 's gone clane enough , ”
5105	5112	5114	5115	a spectator	491	“ Where do the sailor live ? ”
5124	5129	5131	5137	the man who had seen high life	492	“ God knows that , ”
5139	5148	5131	5137	the man who had seen high life	492	“ He 's without doubt a stranger here . ”
5149	5158	5168	5168	her	493	“ He came in about five minutes ago , ”
5174	5200	5168	5168	her	493	“ And then ' a stepped back , and then ' a looked in again . I 'm not a penny the better for him . ”
5201	5210	5212	5214	the staylace vendor	495	“ Serves the husband well be - right , ”
5216	5300	5212	5214	the staylace vendor	495	“ A comely respectable body like her — what can a man want more ? I glory in the woman 's sperrit . I 'd ha ' done it myself — od send if I would n't , if a husband had behaved so to me ! I 'd go , and ' a might call , and call , till his keacorn was raw ; but I 'd never come back — no , not till the great trumpet , would I ! ”
5301	5311	5313	5318	another of a more deliberative turn	496	“ Well , the woman will be better off , ”
5320	5358	5313	5318	another of a more deliberative turn	496	“ For seafaring natures be very good shelter for shorn lambs , and the man do seem to have plenty of money , which is what she 's not been used to lately , by all showings . ”
5359	5370	5372	5373	the trusser	341	“ Mark me — I 'll not go after her ! ”
5381	5426	5372	5373	the trusser	341	“ Let her go ! If she 's up to such vagaries she must suffer for 'em . She 'd no business to take the maid — ' tis my maid ; and if it were the doing again she should n't have her ! ”
5797	5810	5811	5811	he	291	“ I must get out of this as soon as I can , ”
5832	5905	5811	5811	he	291	“ She 's gone — to be sure she is — gone with that sailor who bought her , and little Elizabeth - Jane . We walked here , and I had the furmity , and rum in it — and sold her . Yes , that 's what 's happened and here am I. Now , what am I to do — am I sober enough to walk , I wonder ? ”
6367	6386	6387	6387	he	291	“ Did I tell my name to anybody last night , or did n't I tell my name ? ”
6574	6589	6590	6590	he	291	“ Yet she knows I am not in my senses when I do that ! ”
6593	6621	6622	6622	he	291	“ Well , I must walk about till I find her .... Seize her , why did n't she know better than bring me into this disgrace ! ”
6626	6659	6622	6622	he	291	“ She was n't queer if I was . ' Tis like Susan to show such idiotic simplicity . Meek — that meekness has done me more harm than the bitterest temper ! ”
6936	7020	6932	6932	he	291	“ I , Michael Henchard , on this morning of the sixteenth of September , do take an oath before God here in this solemn place that I will avoid all strong liquors for the space of twenty - one years to come , being a year for every year that I have lived . And this I swear upon the book before me ; and may I be strook dumb , blind , and helpless , if I break this my oath ! ”
7946	7966	7968	7969	the maiden	605	“ Why did we hinder our time by coming in here ? I thought you wished to get onward ? ”
7971	7980	7982	7983	the other	338	“ Yes , my dear Elizabeth - Jane , ”
7985	7996	7982	7983	the other	338	“ But I had a fancy for looking up here . ”
7997	8000	8047	8047	she	338	“ Why ? ”
8001	8018	8047	8047	she	338	“ It was here I first met with Newson — on such a day as this . ”
8019	8045	8047	8047	she	338	“ First met with father here ? Yes , you have told me so before . And now he 's drowned and gone from us ! ”
8084	8115	8047	8047	she	338	“ In affectionate memory of Richard Newson , mariner , who was unfortunately lost at sea , in the month of November 184 — , aged forty - one years . ”
8116	8122	8124	8125	her mother	588	“ And it was here , ”
8131	8149	8124	8125	her mother	588	“ that I last saw the relation we are going to look for — Mr. Michael Henchard . ”
8150	8170	8124	8125	her mother	588	“ What is his exact kin to us , mother ? I have never clearly had it told me . ”
8171	8189	8191	8192	her mother	588	“ He is , or was — for he may be dead — a connection by marriage , ”
8195	8209	8211	8213	the young woman	310	“ That 's exactly what you have said a score of times before ! ”
8220	8231	8211	8213	the young woman	310	“ He 's not a near relation , I suppose ? ”
8232	8238	8191	8192	her mother	588	“ Not by any means . ”
8239	8258	8211	8213	the young woman	310	“ He was a hay - trusser , was n't he , when you last heard of him ? “
8262	8263	8259	8259	He	611	” “
8271	8290	8266	8266	he	611	” the girl innocently continued . Mrs. Henchard paused for a moment , and answered un - easily , “
8304	8315	8266	8266	he	611	” She moved on to another part of the field . “
8330	8341	8324	8324	anybody	4437	” the daughter observed , as she gazed round about . “
8372	8373	8374	8374	I	0	” “
8382	8405	8374	8374	I	0	” said Mrs. Newson , as she now called herself , keenly eyeing something under a green bank a little way off . “
8409	8486	8374	8374	I	0	” The daughter looked in the direction signified . The object pointed out was a tripod of sticks stuck into the earth , from which hung a three - legged crock , kept hot by a smouldering wood fire beneath . Over the pot stooped an old woman haggard , wrinkled , and almost in rags . She stirred the contents of the pot with a large spoon , and occasionally croaked in a broken voice , “
8492	8548	8374	8374	I	0	” It was indeed the former mistress of the furmity tent — once thriving , cleanly , white - aproned , and chinking with money — now tentless , dirty , owning no tables or benches , and having scarce any customers except two small whity - brown boys , who came up and asked for “
8557	8572	8573	8573	She	616	” which she served in a couple of chipped yellow basins of commonest clay . “
8580	8594	8573	8573	She	616	” resumed Mrs. Newson , making a step as if to draw nearer . “
8606	8611	8612	8612	I	0	” urged the other . “
8629	8737	8612	8612	I	0	” The girl was not loth , and turned to some stalls of coloured prints while her mother went forward . The old woman begged for the latter 's custom as soon as she saw her , and responded to Mrs. Henchard - Newson 's request for a pennyworth with more alacrity than she had shown in selling six - pennyworths in her younger days . When the soi - disant widow had taken the basin of thin poor slop that stood for the rich concoction of the former time , the hag opened a little basket behind the fire , and looking up slily , whispered , “
8766	8820	8821	8821	You	191	” Her customer smiled bitterly at this survival of the old trick , and shook her head with a meaning the old woman was far from translating . She pretended to eat a little of the furmity with the leaden spoon offered , and as she did so said blandly to the hag , “
8827	8828	8821	8821	You	191	” “
8839	8853	8834	8834	ye	618	” responded the old woman , opening the sluices of her heart forthwith . “
9010	9026	9028	9028	you	637	” Mrs. Newson glanced round — her daughter was still bending over the distant stalls . “
9033	9042	9028	9028	you	637	” she said cautiously to the old woman , “
9061	9072	9028	9028	you	637	” The hag reflected , and half shook her head . “
9089	9093	9080	9080	I	0	” she said . “
9142	9143	9205	9205	Lord	643	” “
9152	9162	9205	9205	Lord	643	” The furmity woman half shook her head again . “
9166	9170	9171	9171	I	0	” she said , “
9302	9355	9356	9356	Mother	4495	” Mrs. Newson would have rewarded the old woman as far as her small means afforded had she not discreetly borne in mind that it was by that unscrupulous person 's liquor her husband had been degraded . She briefly thanked her informant , and rejoined Elizabeth , who greeted her with , “
9383	9384	9379	9380	the lowest	651	” “
9394	9400	9389	9389	I	0	” said her mother quietly . “
9446	9470	9434	9434	he	653	” With this they descended out of the fair , and went onward to the village , where they obtained a night 's lodging .
10372	10375	10377	10377	she	300	“ better , ”
10866	10878	10880	10882	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ What an old - fashioned place it seems to be ! ”
10895	10926	10880	10882	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ It is huddled all together ; and it is shut in by a square wall of trees , like a plot of garden ground by a box - edging . ”
11181	11186	11188	11188	Elizabeth	191	“ Why , surely , ”
11194	11212	11188	11188	Elizabeth	191	“ those men mentioned the name of Henchard in their talk — the name of our relative ? ”
11213	11219	11221	11222	Mrs. Newson	128	“ I thought so too , ”
11224	11237	11221	11222	Mrs. Newson	128	“ That seems a hint to us that he is still here . ”
11238	11241	11188	11188	Elizabeth	191	“ Yes . ”
11242	11256	11188	11188	Elizabeth	191	“ Shall I run after them , and ask them about him — — ”
11257	11288	11188	11188	Elizabeth	191	“ No , no , no ! Not for the world just yet . He may be in the workhouse , or in the stocks , for all we know . ”
11289	11301	11188	11188	Elizabeth	191	“ Dear me — why should you think that , mother ? ”
11302	11321	11188	11188	Elizabeth	191	“ ' Twas just something to say — that 's all ! But we must make private inquiries . ”
12185	12203	12204	12204	she	792	“ Ye may as well look for manna - food as good bread in Casterbridge just now , ”
12211	12227	12230	12230	her	792	“ They can blare their trumpets and thump their drums , and have their roaring dinners ”
12255	12283	12230	12230	her	792	“ but we must needs be put - to for want of a wholesome crust . There 's less good bread than good beer in Casterbridge now . ”

12303	12314	12316	12317	Mrs. Henchard	128	“ How does it happen there 's no good bread ? ”
12319	12444	12316	12317	Mrs. Henchard	128	“ Oh , ' tis the corn - factor — he 's the man that our millers and bakers all deal wi ' , and he has sold 'em growed wheat , which they did n't know was growed , so they SAY , till the dough ran all over the ovens like quicksilver ; so that the loaves be as flat as toads , and like suet pudden inside . I 've been a wife , and I 've been a mother , and I never see such unprincipled bread in Casterbridge as this before . — But you must be a real stranger here not to know what 's made all the poor volks ' insides plim like blowed bladders this week ? ”
12445	12449	12473	12473	she	744	“ I am , ”

12655	12675	12677	12678	Mrs. Newson	128	“ We might , perhaps , after all , make a few inquiries about — our relation Mr. Henchard , ”
12694	12766	12767	12767	She	128	“ And this , I think , would be a good place for trying it — just to ask , you know , how he stands in the town — if he is here , as I think he must be . You , Elizabeth - Jane , had better be the one to do it . I 'm too worn out to do anything — pull down your fall first . ”
12788	12797	12799	12800	the girl	311	“ What 's going on to - night ? ”
12822	12832	12834	12836	the old man	818	“ Well , ye must be a stranger sure , ”
12846	12955	12834	12836	the old man	818	“ Why , ' tis a great public dinner of the gentle - people and such like leading volk — wi ' the Mayor in the chair . As we plainer fellows bain't invited , they leave the winder - shutters open that we may get jist a sense o't out here . If you mount the steps you can see em . That 's Mr. Henchard , the Mayor , at the end of the table , a facing ye ; and that 's the Council men right and left .... Ah , lots of them when they begun life were no more than I be now ! ”
12956	12959	12961	12963	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Henchard ! ”
13019	13026	13045	13045	she	588	“ Mr. Henchard , the Mayor , ”
13535	13543	13545	13546	the girl	311	“ Have you seen him , mother ? ”
13548	13553	13545	13546	the girl	311	“ Yes , yes , ”
13559	13584	13545	13546	the girl	311	“ I have seen him , and it is enough for me ! Now I only want to go — pass away — die . ”
13585	13591	13592	13592	She	311	“ Why — O what ? ”
13604	13704	13592	13592	She	311	“ Does he seem to you not likely to befriend us ? I thought he looked a generous man . What a gentleman he is , is n't he ? and how his diamond studs shine ! How strange that you should have said he might be in the stocks , or in the workhouse , or dead ! Did ever anything go more by contraries ! Why do you feel so afraid of him ? I am not at all ; I 'll call upon him — he can but say he do n't own such remote kin . ”
13705	13727	13592	13592	She	311	“ I do n't know at all — I ca n't tell what to set about . I feel so down . ”
13728	13764	13592	13592	She	311	“ Do n't be that , mother , now we have got here and all ! Rest there where you be a little while — I will look on and find out more about him . ”
13765	13801	13592	13592	She	311	“ I do n't think I can ever meet Mr. Henchard . He is not how I thought he would be — he overpowers me ! I do n't wish to see him any more . ”
13802	13811	13812	13814	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ But wait a little time and consider . ”
14014	14026	14027	14027	she	191	“ They do n't fill Mr. Henchard 's wine - glasses , ”
14040	14128	14129	14131	Another elderly man	848	“ Ah , no ; do n't ye know him to be the celebrated abstaining worthy of that name ? He scorns all tempting liquors ; never touches nothing . O yes , he've strong qualities that way . I have heard tell that he sware a gospel oath in bygone times , and has bode by it ever since . So they do n't press him , knowing it would be unbecoming in the face of that : for yer gospel oath is a serious thing . ”
14143	14158	14129	14131	Another elderly man	848	“ How much longer have he got to suffer from it , Solomon Longways ? ”
14159	14212	14129	14131	Another elderly man	848	“ Another two year , they say . I do n't know the why and the wherefore of his fixing such a time , for ' a never has told anybody . But ' tis exactly two calendar years longer , they say . A powerful mind to hold out so long ! ”
14213	14269	14129	14131	Another elderly man	848	“ True .... But there 's great strength in hope . Knowing that in four - and - twenty months ' time ye'll be out of your bondage , and able to make up for all you 've suffered , by partaking without stint — why , it keeps a man up , no doubt . ”
14270	14293	14295	14295	Longways	131	“ No doubt , Christopher Coney , no doubt . And ' a must need such reflections — a lonely widow man , ”
14297	14305	14307	14307	Elizabeth	191	“ When did he lose his wife ? ”
14309	14323	14324	14325	Solomon Longways	131	“ I never knowed her . ' Twas afore he came to Casterbridge , ”
14351	14393	14336	14336	his	131	“ But I know that ' a 's a banded teetotaller , and that if any of his men be ever so little overtook by a drop he 's down upon 'em as stern as the Lord upon the jovial Jews . ”
14394	14402	14404	14406	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Has he many men , then ? ”
14408	14630	14404	14406	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Many ! Why , my good maid , he 's the powerfullest member of the Town Council , and quite a principal man in the country round besides . Never a big dealing in wheat , barley , oats , hay , roots , and such - like but Henchard 's got a hand in it . Ay , and he 'll go into other things too ; and that 's where he makes his mistake . He worked his way up from nothing when ' a came here ; and now he 's a pillar of the town . Not but what he 's been shaken a little to - year about this bad corn he has supplied in his contracts . I 've seen the sun rise over Durnover Moor these nine - and - sixty year , and though Mr. Henchard has never cussed me unfairly ever since I 've worked for'n , seeing I be but a little small man , I must say that I have never before tasted such rough bread as has been made from Henchard 's wheat lately . ' Tis that growed out that ye could a'most call it malt , and there 's a list at bottom o ' the loaf as thick as the sole of one 's shoe . ”
14711	14718	14720	14721	his audience	851	“ Ha - ha - ha ! ”
14740	14754	14720	14721	his audience	851	“ This is all very well ; but how about the bad bread ? ”
14882	14894	14877	14877	they	859	“ Hey ! How about the bad bread , Mr. Mayor ? ”
14915	14929	14909	14909	they	859	“ You rather ought to tell the story o ' that , sir ! ”
14942	14954	14955	14955	he	120	“ Well , I admit that the wheat turned out badly , ”
14958	14979	14955	14955	he	120	“ But I was taken in in buying it as much as the bakers who bought it o ' me . ”
14980	14994	14996	15001	the inharmonious man outside the window	862	“ And the poor folk who had to eat it whether or no , ”
15035	15048	15049	15049	he	120	“ You must make allowances for the accidents of a large business , ”
15052	15143	15049	15049	he	120	“ You must bear in mind that the weather just at the harvest of that corn was worse than we have known it for years . However , I have mended my arrangements on account o't . Since I have found my business too large to be well looked after by myself alone , I have advertised for a thorough good man as manager of the corn department . When I 've got him you will find these mistakes will no longer occur — matters will be better looked into . ”
15144	15159	15161	15176	the man who had before spoken , and who seemed to be a baker or miller	864	“ But what are you going to do to repay us for the past ? ”
15178	15193	15194	15194	Henchard	120	“ Will you replace the grown flour we 've still got by sound grain ? ”
15234	15263	15230	15230	he	120	“ If anybody will tell me how to turn grown wheat into wholesome wheat I 'll take it back with pleasure . But it ca n't be done . ”
15467	15474	15475	15475	he	4470	“ It ca n't be done , ”
15567	15576	15577	15577	he	4470	“ Give this to the Mayor at once , ”
15635	15654	15630	15632	the young stranger	883	“ And can ye tell me of a respectable hotel that 's a little more moderate than this ? ”
15665	15682	15683	15683	he	4470	“ They say the Three Mariners , just below here , is a very good place , ”
15687	15696	15683	15683	he	4470	“ but I have never stayed there myself . ”
16060	16069	16070	16070	she	191	“ The evening is drawing on , mother , ”
16073	16081	16070	16070	she	191	“ What do you propose to do ? ”
16094	16105	16106	16106	she	191	“ We must get a place to lie down in , ”
16109	16126	16106	16106	she	191	“ I have seen — Mr. Henchard ; and that 's all I wanted to do . ”
16127	16140	16141	16143	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ That 's enough for to - night , at any rate , ”
16147	16179	16141	16143	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ We can think to - morrow what is best to do about him . The question now is — is it not ? — how shall we find a lodging ? ”
16222	16234	16235	16235	she	191	“ Let 's go where the young man has gone to , ”
16238	16248	16235	16235	she	191	“ He is respectable . What do you say ? ”
16348	16366	16323	16324	the waiter	882	“ A young man , sir — a sort of traveller . He was a Scotchman seemingly . ”
16367	16377	16323	16324	the waiter	882	“ Did he say how he had got it ? ”
16378	16393	16323	16324	the waiter	882	“ He wrote it himself , sir , as he stood outside the window . ”
16394	16409	16323	16324	the waiter	882	“ Oh — wrote it himself .... Is the young man in the hotel ? ”
16410	16425	16426	16427	The mayor	4556	“ No , sir . He went to the Three Mariners , I believe . ”
17431	17445	17447	17449	the elder woman	982	“ ' Tis too good for us — we ca n't meet it ! ”
17465	17473	17475	17475	Elizabeth	191	“ I fear it is , too , ”
17477	17484	17475	17475	Elizabeth	191	“ But we must be respectable . ”
17485	17498	17500	17501	her mother	588	“ We must pay our way even before we must be respectable , ”
17503	17533	17500	17501	her mother	588	“ Mr. Henchard is too high for us to make ourselves known to him , I much fear ; so we 've only our own pockets to depend on . ”
17534	17542	17544	17544	Elizabeth	191	“ I know what I 'll do , ”
17614	17642	17643	17643	she	191	“ As you seem busy here to - night , and mother 's not well off , might I take out part of our accommodation by helping ? ”
17842	17849	17851	17852	the landlady	972	“ ' Tis the Scotch gentleman , ”
17862	17896	17897	17897	Elizabeth	191	“ Now then , can you go and see if his supper is on the tray ? If it is you can take it up to him . The front room over this . ”
18489	18494	18485	18485	she	588	“ ' Tis he . ”
18495	18498	18500	18501	the girl	311	“ Who ? ”
18503	18507	18500	18501	the girl	311	“ The Mayor . ”
18631	18653	18655	18656	the Mayor	4556	“ I merely strolled in on my way home to ask you a question about something that has excited my curiosity , ”
18662	18672	18655	18656	the Mayor	4556	“ But I see you have not finished supper . ”
18673	18709	18710	18710	Henchard	128	“ Ay , but I will be done in a little ! Ye need n't go , sir . Take a seat . I 've almost done , and it makes no difference at all . ”
18725	18738	18722	18722	he	4556	“ Well , first I should ask , did you write this ? ”
18745	18751	18753	18754	the Scotchman	886	“ Yes , I did , ”
18756	18759	18761	18761	Henchard	128	“ Then , ”
18763	18823	18761	18761	Henchard	128	“ I am under the impression that we have met by accident while waiting for the morning to keep an appointment with each other ? My name is Henchard , ha'n't you replied to an advertisement for a corn - factor 's manager that I put into the paper — ha'n't you come here to see me about it ? ”
18824	18827	18829	18830	the Scotchman	886	“ No , ”
18836	18843	18846	18846	Henchard	128	“ Surely you are the man , ”
18849	18871	18846	18846	Henchard	128	“ who arranged to come and see me ? Joshua , Joshua , Jipp — Jopp — what was his name ? ”
18872	18877	18879	18881	the young man	371	“ You 're wrong ! ”
18883	18967	18879	18881	the young man	371	“ My name is Donald Farfrae . It is true I am in the corren trade — but I have replied to no advertisement , and arranged to see no one . I am on my way to Bristol — from there to the other side of the warrld , to try my fortune in the great wheat - growing districts of the West ! I have some inventions useful to the trade , and there is no scope for developing them heere . ”
18968	18976	18978	18978	Henchard	128	“ To America — well , well , ”
18998	19010	18978	18978	Henchard	128	“ And yet I could have sworn you were the man ! ”
19027	19047	19024	19024	Henchard	128	“ Then I am truly and sincerely obliged to you for the few words you wrote on that paper . ”
19048	19055	18879	18881	the young man	371	“ It was nothing , sir . ”
19056	19189	19190	19192	The young man	371	“ Well , it has a great importance for me just now . This row about my grown wheat , which I declare to Heaven I did n't know to be bad till the people came complaining , has put me to my wits ' end . I 've some hundreds of quarters of it on hand ; and if your renovating process will make it wholesome , why , you can see what a quag ' twould get me out of . I saw in a moment there might be truth in it . But I should like to have it proved ; and of course you do n't care to tell the steps of the process sufficiently for me to do that , without my paying ye well for't first . ”
19199	19210	19211	19211	he	371	“ I do n't know that I have any objection , ”
19214	19284	19211	19211	he	371	“ I 'm going to another country , and curing bad corn is not the line I 'll take up there . Yes , I 'll tell ye the whole of it — you 'll make more out of it heere than I will in a foreign country . Just look heere a minute , sir . I can show ye by a sample in my carpet - bag . ”
19321	19333	19336	19338	the young fellow	1057	“ These few grains will be sufficient to show ye with , ”
19363	19373	19360	19360	he	371	“ There , now , do you taste that . ”
19374	19389	19360	19360	he	371	“ It 's complete ! — quite restored , or — well — nearly . ”
19390	19402	19404	19405	the Scotchman	886	“ Quite enough restored to make good seconds out of it , ”
19407	19485	19404	19405	the Scotchman	886	“ To fetch it back entirely is impossible ; Nature wo n't stand so much as that , but heere you go a great way towards it . Well , sir , that 's the process , I do n't value it , for it can be but of little use in countries where the weather is more settled than in ours ; and I 'll be only too glad if it 's of service to you . ”
19486	19492	19494	19494	Henchard	128	“ But hearken to me , ”
19496	19564	19494	19494	Henchard	128	“ My business you know , is in corn and in hay , but I was brought up as a hay - trusser simply , and hay is what I understand best though I now do more in corn than in the other . If you 'll accept the place , you shall manage the corn branch entirely , and receive a commission in addition to salary . ”
19565	19581	19582	19584	the young man	371	“ You 're liberal — very liberal , but no , no — I cannet ! ”
19595	19600	19602	19602	Henchard	128	“ So be it ! ”
19605	19647	19602	19602	Henchard	128	“ Now — to change the subject — one good turn deserves another ; do n't stay to finish that miserable supper . Come to my house , I can find something better for ' ee than cold ham and ale . ”
19669	19673	19675	19675	Henchard	128	“ Very well , ”
19678	19726	19675	19675	Henchard	128	“ please yourself . But I tell you , young man , if this holds good for the bulk , as it has done for the sample , you have saved my credit , stranger though you be . What shall I pay you for this knowledge ? ”
19727	19782	19783	19783	Henchard	128	“ Nothing at all , nothing at all . It may not prove necessary to ye to use it often , and I do n't value it at all . I thought I might just as well let ye know , as you were in a difficulty , and they were harrd upon ye . ”
19786	19794	19795	19795	he	371	“ I sha n't soon forget this , ”
19798	19862	19795	19795	he	371	“ And from a stranger ! ... I could n't believe you were not the man I had engaged ! Says I to myself , ' He knows who I am , and recommends himself by this stroke . ' And yet it turns out , after all , that you are not the man who answered my advertisement , but a stranger ! ”
19863	19872	19874	19876	the young man	371	“ Ay , ay ; that 's so , ”
19891	20119	19886	19886	his	371	“ Your forehead , Farfrae , is something like my poor brother 's — now dead and gone ; and the nose , too , is n't unlike his . You must be , what — five foot nine , I reckon ? I am six foot one and a half out of my shoes . But what of that ? In my business , ' tis true that strength and bustle build up a firm . But judgment and knowledge are what keep it established . Unluckily , I am bad at science , Farfrae ; bad at figures — a rule o ' thumb sort of man . You are just the reverse — I can see that . I have been looking for such as you these two year , and yet you are not for me . Well , before I go , let me ask this : Though you are not the young man I thought you were , what 's the difference ? Ca n't ye stay just the same ? Have you really made up your mind about this American notion ? I wo n't mince matters . I feel you would be invaluable to me — that need n't be said — and if you will bide and be my manager , I will make it worth your while . ”
20120	20126	20128	20130	the young man	371	“ My plans are fixed , ”
20136	20174	20128	20130	the young man	371	“ I have formed a scheme , and so we need na say any more about it . But will you not drink with me , sir ? I find this Casterbridge ale warreming to the stomach . ”
20175	20189	20191	20191	Henchard	128	“ No , no ; I fain would , but I ca n't , ”
20209	20340	20191	20191	Henchard	128	“ When I was a young man I went in for that sort of thing too strong — far too strong — and was well - nigh ruined by it ! I did a deed on account of it which I shall be ashamed of to my dying day . It made such an impression on me that I swore , there and then , that I 'd drink nothing stronger than tea for as many years as I was old that day . I have kept my oath ; and though , Farfrae , I am sometimes that dry in the dog days that I could drink a quarter - barrel to the pitching , I think o ' my oath , and touch no strong drink at all . ”
20341	20363	20385	20385	his	1064	“ I 'll no ' press ye , sir — I 'll no ' press ye . I respect your vow . ”
20364	20377	20379	20379	Henchard	128	“ Well , I shall get a manager somewhere , no doubt , ”
20388	20405	20379	20379	Henchard	128	“ But it will be long before I see one that would suit me so well ! ”
20430	20443	20444	20444	he	1064	“ I wish I could stay — sincerely I would like to , ”
20447	20465	20444	20444	he	1064	“ But no — it cannet be ! it cannet ! I want to see the warrld . ”
21126	21137	21139	21140	Christopher Coney	132	“ ' Twas not amiss — not at all amiss ! ”
21163	21176	21159	21159	he	132	“ Draw on with the next verse , young gentleman , please . ”
21177	21188	21190	21191	the glazier	1097	“ Yes . Let 's have it again , stranger , ”
21211	21228	21233	21233	he	1097	“ Folks do n't lift up their hearts like that in this part of the world . ”
21238	21251	21233	21233	he	1097	“ Who is the young man ? — Scotch , d'ye say ? ”
21252	21265	21267	21267	Coney	132	“ Yes , straight from the mountains of Scotland , I believe , ”
21344	21358	21360	21361	the glazier	1097	“ Danged if our country down here is worth singing about like that ! ”
21373	21378	21364	21365	the Scotchman	886	“ My ain countree ! ”
21379	21428	21436	21437	the dealer	1102	“ When you take away from among us the fools and the rogues , and the lammigers , and the wanton hussies , and the slatterns , and such like , there 's cust few left to ornament a song with in Casterbridge , or the country round . ”
21429	21432	21434	21434	Buzzford	142	“ True , ”
21447	21525	21436	21437	the dealer	1102	“ Casterbridge is a old , hoary place o ' wickedness , by all account . ' Tis recorded in history that we rebelled against the King one or two hundred years ago , in the time of the Romans , and that lots of us was hanged on Gallows Hill , and quartered , and our different jints sent about the country like butcher 's meat ; and for my part I can well believe it . ”
21526	21549	21551	21552	Christopher Coney	132	“ What did ye come away from yer own country for , young maister , if ye be so wownded about it ? ”
21570	21656	21551	21552	Christopher Coney	132	“ Faith , it was n't worth your while on our account , for as Maister Billy Wills says , we be bruckle folk here — the best o ' us hardly honest sometimes , what with hard winters , and so many mouths to fill , and Goda'mighty sending his little taties so terrible small to fill 'em with . We do n't think about flowers and fair faces , not we — except in the shape o ' cauliflowers and pigs ' chaps . ”
21657	21662	21664	21665	Donald Farfrae	139	“ But , no ! ”
21676	21701	21664	21665	Donald Farfrae	139	“ the best of ye hardly honest — not that surely ? None of ye has been stealing what did n't belong to him ? ”
21702	21709	21711	21712	Solomon Longways	131	“ Lord ! no , no ! ”
21717	21738	21711	21712	Solomon Longways	131	“ That 's only his random way o ' speaking . ' A was always such a man of underthoughts . ”
21745	21773	21711	21712	Solomon Longways	131	“ Do n't ye be so over - familiar with a gentleman that ye know nothing of — and that 's travelled a'most from the North Pole . ”
21795	21846	21788	21788	he	132	“ Be dazed , if I loved my country half as well as the young feller do , I 'd live by claning my neighbour 's pigsties afore I 'd go away ! For my part I 've no more love for my country than I have for Botany Bay ! ”
21847	21850	21852	21852	Longways	131	“ Come , ”
21854	21873	21852	21852	Longways	131	“ let the young man draw onward with his ballet , or we shall be here all night . ”
21874	21881	21883	21884	the singer	1094	“ That 's all of it , ”
21887	21899	21901	21903	the general dealer	1106	“ Soul of my body , then we 'll have another ! ”
21905	21917	21919	21926	a fat woman with a figured purple apron	1107	“ Can you turn a strain to the ladies , sir ? ”
21944	21964	21966	21968	the master glazier	1108	“ Let him breathe — let him breathe , Mother Cuxsom . He hain't got his second wind yet , ”
21970	21978	21980	21982	the young man	371	“ Oh yes , but I have ! ”
21989	21992	21985	21985	he	371	“ O Nannie ”
22013	22018	21985	21985	he	371	“ Auld Lang Syne . ”
22220	22232	22233	22233	she	136	“ And are you going to bide in Casterbridge , sir ? ”
22236	22241	22243	22244	the Scotchman	886	“ Ah — no ! ”
22253	22276	22243	22244	the Scotchman	886	“ I 'm only passing thirrough ! I am on my way to Bristol , and on frae there to foreign parts . ”
22277	22286	22288	22289	Solomon Longways	131	“ We be truly sorry to hear it , ”
22291	22393	22288	22289	Solomon Longways	131	“ We can ill afford to lose tuneful wynd - pipes like yours when they fall among us . And verily , to mak ' acquaintance with a man a - come from so far , from the land o ' perpetual snow , as we may say , where wolves and wild boars and other dangerous animalcules be as common as blackbirds here - about — why , ' tis a thing we ca n't do every day ; and there 's good sound information for bide - at - homes like we when such a man opens his mouth . ”
22394	22403	22405	22407	the young man	371	“ Nay , but ye mistake my country , ”
22435	22542	22423	22423	his	371	“ There are not perpetual snow and wolves at all in it ! — except snow in winter , and — well — a little in summer just sometimes , and a ' gaberlunzie ' or two stalking about here and there , if ye may call them dangerous . Eh , but you should take a summer jarreny to Edinboro ' , and Arthur 's Seat , and all round there , and then go on to the lochs , and all the Highland scenery — in May and June — and you would never say ' tis the land of wolves and perpetual snow ! ”
22543	22553	22555	22555	Buzzford	142	“ Of course not — it stands to reason , ”
22557	22592	22555	22555	Buzzford	142	“ ' Tis barren ignorance that leads to such words . He 's a simple home - spun man , that never was fit for good company — think nothing of him , sir . ”
22593	22629	22631	22632	Christopher Coney	132	“ And do ye carry your flock bed , and your quilt , and your crock , and your bit of chiney ? or do ye go in bare bones , as I may say ? ”
22634	22654	22655	22655	Donald	139	“ I 've sent on my luggage — though it is n't much ; for the voyage is long . ”
22667	22699	22664	22664	he	1122	“ But I said to myself , ' Never a one of the prizes of life will I come by unless I undertake it ! ' and I decided to go . ”
23171	23178	23179	23179	she	191	“ We 've made a mistake , ”
23192	23255	23179	23179	she	191	“ On no account ought ye to have helped serve here to - night . Not because of ourselves , but for the sake of him . If he should befriend us , and take us up , and then find out what you did when staying here , ' twould grieve and wound his natural pride as Mayor of the town . ”
23288	23290	23292	23298	another man than her poor mother 's	1142	“ he ”
23300	23304	23305	23305	she	191	“ For myself , ”
23308	23377	23305	23305	she	191	“ I did n't at all mind waiting a little upon him . He 's so respectable , and educated — far above the rest of 'em in the inn . They thought him very simple not to know their grim broad way of talking about themselves here . But of course he did n't know — he was too refined in his mind to know such things ! ”
23386	23388	23390	23391	her mother	588	“ he ”
23462	23478	23479	23479	he	1147	“ To be sure , to be sure , how that fellow does draw me ! ”
23485	23511	23479	23479	he	1147	“ I suppose ' tis because I 'm so lonely . I 'd have given him a third share in the business to have stayed ! ”
23769	23779	23781	23781	Henchard	120	“ And you are off soon , I suppose ? ”
23784	23793	23795	23796	the other	338	“ Yes — almost this moment , sir , ”
23798	23812	23795	23796	the other	338	“ Maybe I 'll walk on till the coach makes up on me . ”
23813	23817	23762	23763	Donald Farfrae	139	“ Which way ? ”
23818	23825	23795	23796	the other	338	“ The way ye are going . ”
23826	23839	23795	23796	the other	338	“ Then shall we walk together to the top o ' town ? ”
23840	23847	23849	23850	the Scotchman	886	“ If ye'll wait a minute , ”
23887	23893	23894	23894	he	120	“ Ah , my lad , ”
23897	23912	23894	23894	he	120	“ you should have been a wise man , and have stayed with me . ”
23913	23924	23926	23926	Donald	139	“ Yes , yes — it might have been wiser , ”
23938	23954	23926	23926	Donald	139	“ It is only telling ye the truth when I say my plans are vague . ”
24056	24068	24069	24069	she	191	“ He was a good man — and he 's gone , ”
24074	24096	24069	24069	she	191	“ I was nothing to him , and there was no reason why he should have wished me good - bye . ”
24153	24161	24162	24162	she	191	“ You are still thinking , mother , ”
24170	24223	24162	24162	she	191	“ Yes ; I am thinking of Mr. Henchard 's sudden liking for that young man . He was always so . Now , surely , if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all , may he not take as warmly to his own kin ? ”
24287	24298	24302	24302	his	1188	“ Henchard , corn - factor and hay - merchant . ”
24430	24436	24437	24437	she	380	“ If he says no , ”
24453	24554	24437	24437	she	380	“ if he thinks it does not become the good position he has reached to in the town , to own — to let us call on him as — his distant kinfolk , say , ' Then , sir , we would rather not intrude ; we will leave Casterbridge as quietly as we have come , and go back to our own country . ' ... I almost feel that I would rather he did say so , as I have not seen him for so many years , and we are so — little allied to him ! ”
24555	24562	24564	24567	the more sanguine one	1196	“ And if he say yes ? ”
24569	24574	24576	24577	Mrs. Henchard	128	“ In that case , ”
24580	24601	24576	24577	Mrs. Henchard	128	“ ask him to write me a note , saying when and how he will see us — or ME . ”
24613	24618	24620	24621	her mother	588	“ And tell him , ”
24623	24660	24620	24621	her mother	588	“ that I fully know I have no claim upon him — that I am glad to find he is thriving ; that I hope his life may be long and happy — there , go . ”
24796	24800	24750	24751	umbrella stealers	1205	“ bloody warriors , ”
26017	26021	26022	26022	Elizabeth	191	“ Come in . ”
26123	26130	26132	26133	the Scotchman	886	“ Yes , what it is ? ”
26152	26169	26171	26173	the young man	371	“ Ah , yes ; will you wait a minute ? He 's engaged just now , ”
26341	26351	26353	26353	Henchard	120	“ Well , here 's success to ' ee , ”
26390	26416	26424	26424	he	120	“ I shall often think of this time , and of how you came at the very moment to throw a light upon my difficulty . ”
26432	26578	26424	26424	he	120	“ Now I am not the man to let a cause be lost for want of a word . And before ye are gone for ever I 'll speak . Once more , will ye stay ? There it is , flat and plain . You can see that it is n't all selfishness that makes me press ' ee ; for my business is not quite so scientific as to require an intellect entirely out of the common . Others would do for the place without doubt . Some selfishness perhaps there is , but there is more ; it is n't for me to repeat what . Come bide with me — and name your own terms . I 'll agree to 'em willingly and ' ithout a word of gainsaying ; for , hang it , Farfrae , I like thee well ! ”
26624	26634	26635	26635	he	371	“ I never expected this — I did not ! ”
26638	26667	26635	26635	he	371	“ It 's Providence ! Should any one go against it ? No ; I 'll not go to America ; I 'll stay and be your man ! ”
26685	26688	26690	26690	Henchard	120	“ Done , ”
26692	26695	26697	26698	Donald Farfrae	139	“ Done , ”
26717	26724	26725	26725	he	120	“ Now you are my friend ! ”
26728	26754	26725	26725	he	120	“ Come back to my house ; let 's clinch it at once by clear terms , so as to be comfortable in our minds . ”
26782	26801	26802	26802	he	120	“ I am the most distant fellow in the world when I do n't care for a man , ”
26805	26930	26802	26802	he	120	“ But when a man takes my fancy he takes it strong . Now I am sure you can eat another breakfast ? You could n't have eaten much so early , even if they had anything at that place to gi'e thee , which they had n't ; so come to my house and we will have a solid , staunch tuck - in , and settle terms in black - and - white if you like ; though my word 's my bond . I can always make a good meal in the morning . I 've got a splendid cold pigeon - pie going just now . You can have some home - brewed if you want to , you know . ”
26931	26942	26944	26944	Farfrae	139	“ It is too airly in the morning for that , ”
26949	26982	26944	26944	Farfrae	139	“ Well , of course , I did n't know . I do n't drink it because of my oath , but I am obliged to brew for my work - people . ”
27177	27190	27172	27172	his	4474	“ Joshua Jopp , sir — by appointment — the new manager . ”
27191	27203	27205	27205	Henchard	120	“ The new manager ! — he 's in his office , ”
27208	27213	27215	27216	the man	291	“ In his office ! ”
27223	27228	27230	27230	Henchard	120	“ I mentioned Thursday , ”
27232	27269	27230	27230	Henchard	120	“ and as you did not keep your appointment , I have engaged another manager . At first I thought he must be you . Do you think I can wait when business is in question ? ”
27270	27279	27281	27282	the newcomer	1337	“ You said Thursday or Saturday , sir , ”
27289	27297	27299	27302	the corn - factor	4538	“ Well , you are too late , ”
27304	27311	27299	27302	the corn - factor	4538	“ I can say no more . ”
27312	27320	27322	27323	the man	291	“ You as good as engaged me , ”
27325	27331	27333	27333	Henchard	120	“ Subject to an interview , ”
27335	27353	27333	27333	Henchard	120	“ I am sorry for you — very sorry indeed . But it ca n't be helped . ”
27452	27464	27465	27465	he	291	“ Now then , what is it , my young woman ? ”
27469	27482	27484	27484	she	191	“ Can I speak to you — not on business , sir ? ”
27486	27492	27493	27493	He	291	“ Yes — I suppose . ”
27500	27510	27511	27511	she	191	“ I am sent to tell you , sir , ”
27516	27550	27511	27511	she	191	“ that a distant relative of yours by marriage , Susan Newson , a sailor 's widow , is in the town , and to ask whether you would wish to see her . ”
27566	27575	27576	27576	he	291	“ Oh — Susan is — still alive ? ”
27581	27586	27576	27576	he	291	“ Yes , sir . ”
27587	27593	27511	27511	she	191	“ Are you her daughter ? ”
27594	27603	27511	27511	she	191	“ Yes , sir — her only daughter . ”
27604	27616	27576	27576	he	291	“ What — do you call yourself — your Christian name ? ”
27617	27624	27511	27511	she	191	“ Elizabeth - Jane , sir . ”
27625	27628	27511	27511	she	191	“ Newson ? ”
27629	27635	27576	27576	he	291	“ Elizabeth - Jane Newson . ”
27696	27708	27709	27709	he	291	“ I am — a good deal interested in your news , ”
27712	27731	27709	27709	he	291	“ And as this is not a matter of business , but pleasure , suppose we go indoors . ”
27887	27890	None	None	None	None	“ Josephus , ”
27893	27899	27983	27983	he	291	“ Whole Duty of Man . ”
27971	27982	28002	28002	he	291	“ Sit down — Elizabeth - Jane — sit down , ”
28018	28028	27990	27990	his	291	“ Your mother , then , is quite well ? ”
28029	28041	28002	28002	he	291	“ She is rather worn out , sir , with travelling . ”
28042	28053	28002	28002	he	291	“ A sailor 's widow — when did he die ? ”
28054	28061	28002	28002	he	291	“ Father was lost last spring . ”
28067	28070	28088	28088	he	120	“ father , ”
28074	28087	28088	28088	he	120	“ Do you and she come from abroad — America or Australia ? ”
28091	28112	28122	28122	he	120	“ No . We have been in England some years . I was twelve when we came here from Canada . ”
28113	28118	28156	28156	he	120	“ Ah ; exactly . ”
28162	28170	28192	28192	He	120	“ And where is your mother staying ? ”
28171	28177	28190	28190	Henchard	120	“ At the Three Mariners . ”
28178	28188	28211	28211	he	120	“ And you are her daughter Elizabeth - Jane ? ”
28206	28210	28211	28211	he	120	“ I think , ”
28222	28253	28292	28292	she	380	“ you shall take a note from me to your mother . I should like to see her .... She is not left very well off by her late husband ? ”
28286	28291	28362	28362	he	120	“ Not very well , ”
28366	28374	28393	28393	Henchard	128	“ Mrs. Newson , Three Mariners Inn , ”
28382	28391	28393	28393	Henchard	128	“ Deliver it to her personally , please , ”
28395	28426	28508	28508	he	120	“ Well , I am glad to see you here , Elizabeth - Jane — very glad . We must have a long talk together — but not just now . ”
28504	28507	28508	28508	he	120	“ Begad ! ”
28515	28537	28601	28601	Henchard	128	“ I did n't think of that . Perhaps these are impostors — and Susan and the child dead after all ! ”
28591	28599	28782	28782	He	120	“ It never rains but it pours ! ”
28721	28781	30032	30032	he	120	“ Meet me at eight o'clock this evening , if you can , at the Ring on the Budmouth road . The place is easy to find . I can say no more now . The news upsets me almost . The girl seems to be in ignorance . Keep her so till I have seen you . M. H. ”
30025	30031	30032	30032	he	120	“ I do n't drink , ”
30043	30063	30087	30087	he	120	“ You hear , Susan ? — I do n't drink now — I have n't since that night . ”
30091	30163	30074	30074	her	1434	“ If I had known you were living , Susan ! But there was every reason to suppose you and the child were dead and gone . I took every possible step to find you — travelled — advertised . My opinion at last was that you had started for some colony with that man , and had been drowned on your voyage . Why did you keep silent like this ? ”
30164	30272	30074	30074	her	1434	“ O Michael ! because of him — what other reason could there be ? I thought I owed him faithfulness to the end of one of our lives — foolishly I believed there was something solemn and binding in the bargain ; I thought that even in honour I dared not desert him when he had paid so much for me in good faith . I meet you now only as his widow — I consider myself that , and that I have no claim upon you . Had he not died I should never have come — never ! Of that you may be sure . ”
30273	30287	30312	30312	Susan	151	“ Ts - s - s ! How could you be so simple ? ”
30288	30310	30312	30312	Susan	151	“ I do n't know . Yet it would have been very wicked — if I had not thought like that ! ”
30317	30348	30355	30355	she	151	“ Yes — yes — so it would . It is only that which makes me feel ' ee an innocent woman . But — to lead me into this ! ”
30349	30354	30355	30355	she	151	“ What , Michael ? ”
30360	30397	30074	30074	her	1434	“ Why , this difficulty about our living together again , and Elizabeth - Jane . She can not be told all — she would so despise us both that — I could not bear it ! ”
30398	30418	30074	30074	her	1434	“ That was why she was brought up in ignorance of you . I could not bear it either . ”
30419	30477	30482	30482	she	1435	“ Well — we must talk of a plan for keeping her in her present belief , and getting matters straight in spite of it . You have heard I am in a large way of business here — that I am Mayor of the town , and churchwarden , and I do n't know what all ? ”
30478	30481	30482	30482	she	1435	“ Yes , ”
30485	30547	30074	30074	her	1434	“ These things , as well as the dread of the girl discovering our disgrace , makes it necessary to act with extreme caution . So that I do n't see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly , and banished from me ; and there 's the rub o't . ”
30548	30562	30581	30581	he	1435	“ We 'll go away at once . I only came to see — ”
30563	30580	30581	30581	he	1435	“ No , no , Susan ; you are not to go — you mistake me ! ”
30587	30703	30715	30715	she	1436	“ I have thought of this plan : that you and Elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter ; that I meet you , court you , and marry you . Elizabeth - Jane coming to my house as my step - daughter . The thing is so natural and easy that it is half done in thinking o't . This would leave my shady , headstrong , disgraceful life as a young man absolutely unopened ; the secret would be yours and mine only ; and I should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under my roof , as well as my wife . ”
30704	30714	30715	30715	she	1436	“ I am quite in your hands , Michael , ”
30719	30757	30773	30773	Henchard	120	“ I came here for the sake of Elizabeth ; for myself , if you tell me to leave again to - morrow morning , and never come near you more , I am content to go . ”
30758	30771	30773	30773	Henchard	120	“ Now , now ; we do n't want to hear that , ”
30776	30865	30715	30715	she	1436	“ Of course you wo n't leave again . Think over the plan I have proposed for a few hours ; and if you ca n't hit upon a better one we 'll adopt it . I have to be away for a day or two on business , unfortunately ; but during that time you can get lodgings — the only ones in the town fit for you are those over the china - shop in High Street — and you can also look for a cottage . ”
30866	30881	30715	30715	she	1436	“ If the lodgings are in High Street they are dear , I suppose ? ”
30882	30913	30919	30919	she	1437	“ Never mind — you MUST start genteel if our plan is to be carried out . Look to me for money . Have you enough till I come back ? ”
30914	30917	30919	30919	she	1437	“ Quite , ”
30921	30930	30715	30715	she	1436	“ And are you comfortable at the inn ? ”
30931	30935	30715	30715	she	1436	“ O yes . ”
30936	30964	30919	30919	she	1437	“ And the girl is quite safe from learning the shame of her case and ours ? — that 's what makes me most anxious of all . ”
30965	30991	30715	30715	she	1436	“ You would be surprised to find how unlikely she is to dream of the truth . How could she ever suppose such a thing ? ”
30992	30995	31008	31009	Mrs. Henchard	128	“ True ! ”
30996	31006	31008	31009	Mrs. Henchard	128	“ I like the idea of repeating our marriage , ”
31015	31058	30919	30919	she	1437	“ It seems the only right course , after all this . Now I think I must go back to Elizabeth - Jane , and tell her that our kinsman , Mr. Henchard , kindly wishes us to stay in the town . ”
31059	31075	31089	31090	his wife	380	“ Very well — arrange that yourself . I 'll go some way with you . ”
31076	31087	31089	31090	his wife	380	“ No , no . Do n't run any risk ! ”
31093	31112	31118	31118	Henchard	120	“ I can find my way back — it is not late . Please let me go alone . ”
31113	31116	31118	31118	Henchard	120	“ Right , ”
31120	31133	31160	31160	he	120	“ But just one word . Do you forgive me , Susan ? ”
31149	31158	31160	31160	he	120	“ Never mind — all in good time , ”
31162	31174	31337	31337	Henchard	120	“ Judge me by my future works — good - bye ! ”
31343	31358	31479	31479	he	120	“ Do n't let me interrupt you , if ye will stay so late . ”
31468	31478	31520	31520	He	120	“ You shall do no more to - night , ”
31492	31519	31783	31783	He	120	“ There 's time enough to - morrow . Come indoors with me and have some supper . Now you shall ! I am determined on't . ”
31748	31782	31808	31808	Henchard	120	“ Pull your chair round to the fireplace , my dear fellow , and let 's make a blaze — there 's nothing I hate like a black grate , even in September . ”
31801	31806	31808	31808	Henchard	120	“ It is odd , ”
31810	31881	31901	31901	Donald	139	“ that two men should meet as we have done on a purely business ground , and that at the end of the first day I should wish to speak to ' ee on a family matter . But , damn it all , I am a lonely man , Farfrae : I have nobody else to speak to ; and why should n't I tell it to ' ee ? ”
31882	31899	31964	31964	Henchard	120	“ I 'll be glad to hear it , if I can be of any service , ”
31951	31962	31996	31996	they	4432	“ I 've not been always what I am now , ”
32004	32038	31966	31966	his	120	“ I began life as a working hay - trusser , and when I was eighteen I married on the strength o ' my calling . Would you think me a married man ? ”
32039	32051	31996	31996	they	4432	“ I heard in the town that you were a widower . ”
32052	32132	32243	32243	he	120	“ Ah , yes — you would naturally have heard that . Well , I lost my wife nineteen years ago or so — by my own fault .... This is how it came about . One summer evening I was travelling for employment , and she was walking at my side , carrying the baby , our only child . We came to a booth in a country fair . I was a drinking man at that time . ”
32232	32242	32243	32243	he	120	“ I have kept my oath for nineteen years , ”
32247	32258	32204	32204	Henchard	120	“ I have risen to what you see me now . ”
32259	32262	32204	32204	Henchard	120	“ Ay ! ”
32263	32327	32243	32243	he	120	“ Well — no wife could I hear of in all that time ; and being by nature something of a woman - hater , I have found it no hardship to keep mostly at a distance from the sex . No wife could I hear of , I say , till this very day . And now — she has come back . ”
32328	32335	32204	32204	Henchard	120	“ Come back , has she ! ”
32336	32351	32204	32204	Henchard	120	“ This morning — this very morning . And what 's to be done ? ”
32352	32369	32386	32386	Henchard	120	“ Can ye no ' take her and live with her , and make some amends ? ”
32370	32384	32386	32386	Henchard	120	“ That 's what I 've planned and proposed . But , Farfrae , ”
32389	32401	32204	32204	Henchard	120	“ by doing right with Susan I wrong another innocent woman . ”
32402	32409	32204	32204	Henchard	120	“ Ye do n't say that ? ”
32410	32555	32569	32569	Farfrae	139	“ In the nature of things , Farfrae , it is almost impossible that a man of my sort should have the good fortune to tide through twenty years o ' life without making more blunders than one . It has been my custom for many years to run across to Jersey in the the way of business , particularly in the potato and root season . I do a large trade wi ' them in that line . Well , one autumn when stopping there I fell quite ill , and in my illness I sank into one of those gloomy fits I sometimes suffer from , on account o ' the loneliness of my domestic life , when the world seems to have the blackness of hell , and , like Job , I could curse the day that gave me birth . ”
32556	32567	32569	32569	Farfrae	139	“ Ah , now , I never feel like it , ”
32571	32957	32960	32960	his	1478	“ Then pray to God that you never may , young man . While in this state I was taken pity on by a woman — a young lady I should call her , for she was of good family , well bred , and well educated — the daughter of some harum - scarum military officer who had got into difficulties , and had his pay sequestrated . He was dead now , and her mother too , and she was as lonely as I. This young creature was staying at the boarding - house where I happened to have my lodging ; and when I was pulled down she took upon herself to nurse me . From that she got to have a foolish liking for me . Heaven knows why , for I was n't worth it . But being together in the same house , and her feeling warm , we got naturally intimate . I wo n't go into particulars of what our relations were . It is enough to say that we honestly meant to marry . There arose a scandal , which did me no harm , but was of course ruin to her . Though , Farfrae , between you and me , as man and man , I solemnly declare that philandering with womankind has neither been my vice nor my virtue . She was terribly careless of appearances , and I was perhaps more , because o ' my dreary state ; and it was through this that the scandal arose . At last I was well , and came away . When I was gone she suffered much on my account , and did n't forget to tell me so in letters one after another ; till latterly , I felt I owed her something , and thought that , as I had not heard of Susan for so long , I would make this other one the only return I could make , and ask her if she would run the risk of Susan being alive ( very slight as I believed ) and marry me , such as I was . She jumped for joy , and we should no doubt soon have been married — but , behold , Susan appears ! ”
32976	33071	33089	33089	Donald	139	“ Now see what injury a man may cause around him ! Even after that wrong - doing at the fair when I was young , if I had never been so selfish as to let this giddy girl devote herself to me over at Jersey , to the injury of her name , all might now be well . Yet , as it stands , I must bitterly disappoint one of these women ; and it is the second . My first duty is to Susan — there 's no doubt about that . ”
33072	33087	33089	33089	Donald	139	“ They are both in a very melancholy position , and that 's true ! ”
33091	33113	33114	33114	Henchard	120	“ They are ! For myself I do n't care — ' twill all end one way . But these two . ”
33119	33147	33160	33161	the other	338	“ I feel I should like to treat the second , no less than the first , as kindly as a man can in such a case . ”
33148	33158	33160	33161	the other	338	“ Ah , well , it cannet be helped ! ”
33167	33218	33114	33114	Henchard	120	“ You mun write to the young lady , and in your letter you must put it plain and honest that it turns out she cannet be your wife , the first having come back ; that ye cannet see her more ; and that — ye wish her weel . ”
33219	33322	33114	33114	Henchard	120	“ That wo n't do . ' Od seize it , I must do a little more than that ! I must — though she did always brag about her rich uncle or rich aunt , and her expectations from 'em — I must send a useful sum of money to her , I suppose — just as a little recompense , poor girl .... Now , will you help me in this , and draw up an explanation to her of all I 've told ye , breaking it as gently as you can ? I 'm so bad at letters . ”
33323	33328	33160	33161	the other	338	“ And I will . ”
33329	33456	33114	33114	Henchard	120	“ Now , I have n't told you quite all yet . My wife Susan has my daughter with her — the baby that was in her arms at the fair ; and this girl knows nothing of me beyond that I am some sort of relation by marriage . She has grown up in the belief that the sailor to whom I made over her mother , and who is now dead , was her father , and her mother 's husband . What her mother has always felt , she and I together feel now — that we ca n't proclaim our disgrace to the girl by letting her know the truth . Now what would you do ? — I want your advice . ”
33457	33478	33484	33484	Henchard	120	“ I think I 'd run the risk , and tell her the truth . She 'll forgive ye both . ”
33479	33482	33484	33484	Henchard	120	“ Never ! ”
33486	33560	33585	33585	Henchard	120	“ I am not going to let her know the truth . Her mother and I be going to marry again ; and it will not only help us to keep our child 's respect , but it will be more proper . Susan looks upon herself as the sailor 's widow , and wo n't think o ' living with me as formerly without another religious ceremony — and she 's right . ”
33593	33639	33653	33653	Farfrae	139	“ I feel it a great relief , Farfrae , to tell some friend o ' this ! You see now that the Mayor of Casterbridge is not so thriving in his mind as it seems he might be from the state of his pocket . ”
33640	33651	33698	33698	he	120	“ I do . And I 'm sorry for ye ! ”
33685	33697	33698	33698	he	120	“ Can it be that it will go off so easily ! ”
33701	33717	34001	34001	he	120	“ Poor thing — God knows ! Now then , to make amends to Susan ! ”
34005	34025	34108	34108	she	1434	“ This is a very good opportunity for me to ask you to name the happy day , Susan . ”
34103	34107	34108	34108	she	1434	“ O Michael ! ”
34111	34135	34176	34176	Henchard	120	“ I am afraid all this is taking up your time and giving trouble — when I did not expect any such thing ! ”
34169	34174	34176	34176	Henchard	120	“ Not at all , ”
34182	34203	34176	34176	Henchard	120	“ This is only a cottage — it costs me next to nothing . And as to taking up my time ”
34215	34271	34402	34402	her	128	“ I 've a splendid fellow to superintend my business now — a man whose like I 've never been able to lay hands on before . I shall soon be able to leave everything to him , and have more time to call my own than I 've had for these last twenty years . ”
34403	34407	34812	34812	Coney	132	“ The Ghost . ”
34791	34810	34812	34812	Coney	132	“ ' Tis five - and - forty years since I had my settlement in this here town , ”
34814	34846	34897	34898	that lady	1536	“ but daze me if I ever see a man wait so long before to take so little ! There 's a chance even for thee after this , Nance Mockridge . ”
34879	34895	34897	34898	that lady	1536	“ Be cust if I 'd marry any such as he , or thee either , ”
34900	34982	34997	34997	Longways	131	“ As for thee , Christopher , we know what ye be , and the less said the better . And as for he — well , there — ( lowering her voice ) ' tis said ' a was a poor parish ' prentice — I would n't say it for all the world — but ' a was a poor parish ' prentice , that began life wi ' no more belonging to ' en than a carrion crow . ”
34983	34995	34997	34997	Longways	131	“ And now he 's worth ever so much a minute , ”
34999	35021	35060	35060	he	131	“ When a man is said to be worth so much a minute , he 's a man to be considered ! ”
35053	35059	35060	35060	he	131	“ Well , Mother Cuxsom , ”
35063	35094	34897	34898	that lady	1536	“ how 's this ? Here 's Mrs. Newson , a mere skellinton , has got another husband to keep her , while a woman of your tonnage have not . ”
35095	35120	35257	35258	Mrs. Cuxsom	159	“ I have not . Nor another to beat me .... Ah , yes , Cuxsom 's gone , and so shall leather breeches ! ”
35121	35134	35150	35151	Mrs. Cuxsom	159	“ Yes ; with the blessing of God leather breeches shall go . ”
35135	35148	35150	35151	Mrs. Cuxsom	159	“ ' Tisn't worth my old while to think of another husband , ”
35153	35169	35257	35258	Mrs. Cuxsom	159	“ And yet I 'll lay my life I 'm as respectable born as she . ”
35170	35211	35257	35258	Mrs. Cuxsom	159	“ True ; your mother was a very good woman — I can mind her . She were rewarded by the Agricultural Society for having begot the greatest number of healthy children without parish assistance , and other virtuous marvels . ”
35212	35229	35150	35151	Mrs. Cuxsom	159	“ ' Twas that that kept us so low upon ground — that great hungry family . ”
35230	35243	35257	35258	Mrs. Cuxsom	159	“ Ay . Where the pigs be many the wash runs thin . ”
35244	35255	35257	35258	Mrs. Cuxsom	159	“ And dostn't mind how mother would sing , Christopher ? ”
35265	35321	35335	35336	Christopher Coney	132	“ and how we went with her to the party at Mellstock , do ye mind ? — at old Dame Ledlow 's , farmer Shinar 's aunt , do ye mind ? — she we used to call Toad - skin , because her face were so yaller and freckled , do ye mind ? ”
35322	35333	35376	35376	she	1538	“ I do , hee - hee , I do ! ”
35338	35374	35376	35376	she	1538	“ And well do I — for I was getting up husband - high at that time — one - half girl , and t'other half woman , as one may say . And canst mind ”
35398	35475	35382	35382	her	1538	“ canst mind the sherry - wine , and the zilver - snuffers , and how Joan Dummett was took bad when we were coming home , and Jack Griggs was forced to carry her through the mud ; and how ' a let her fall in Dairyman Sweet - apple 's cow - barton , and we had to clane her gown wi ' grass — never such a mess as a ' were in ? ”
35476	35521	35583	35584	Nance Mockridge	158	“ Ay — that I do — hee - hee , such doggery as there was in them ancient days , to be sure ! Ah , the miles I used to walk then ; and now I can hardly step over a furrow ! ”
35563	35581	35583	35584	Nance Mockridge	158	“ Well — there 's a difference between 'em , though he do call himself a teetotaller , ”
35586	35618	35683	35686	The plain little brougham	1543	“ She 'll wish her cake dough afore she 's done of him . There 's a blue - beardy look about ' en ; and ' twill out in time . ”
35619	35682	35715	35715	Solomon	131	“ Stuff — he 's well enough ! Some folk want their luck buttered . If I had a choice as wide as the ocean sea I would n't wish for a better man . A poor twanking woman like her — ' tis a godsend for her , and hardly a pair of jumps or night - rail to her name . ”
35698	35713	35715	35715	Solomon	131	“ Well , we hardly know how to look at things in these times ! ”
35717	35798	35819	35819	Christopher	132	“ There was a man dropped down dead yesterday , not so very many miles from here ; and what wi ' that , and this moist weather , ' tis scarce worth one 's while to begin any work o ' consequence to - day . I 'm in such a low key with drinking nothing but small table ninepenny this last week or two that I shall call and warm up at the Mar'ners as I pass along . ”
35799	35817	35819	35819	Christopher	132	“ I do n't know but that I may as well go with ' ee , Solomon , ”
35821	35832	36103	36103	she	191	“ I 'm as clammy as a cockle - snail . ”
36069	36081	36524	36524	she	191	“ Take , have , and keep , are pleasant words . ”
36512	36523	36524	36524	she	191	“ I wo n't be too gay on any account , ”
36530	36553	36707	36707	she	191	“ It would be tempting Providence to hurl mother and me down , and afflict us again as He used to do . ”
36690	36706	36738	36738	he	1565	“ I happened to have the ribbon by me , so I made it up , ”
36727	36737	36771	36771	Indoors	165	“ Ay — of course — to be sure , ”
36745	36770	36891	36891	he	1565	“ Do as you like — or rather as your mother advises ye . ' Od send — I 've nothing to say to't ! ”
36860	36890	36897	36897	She	380	“ I thought Elizabeth - Jane 's hair — did n't you tell me that Elizabeth - Jane 's hair promised to be black when she was a baby ? ”
36909	36913	36924	36924	Henchard	128	“ Did I ? ”
36927	36961	36973	36973	Susan	122	“ Begad , I nearly forgot myself just now ! What I meant was that the girl 's hair certainly looked as if it would be darker , when she was a baby . ”
36962	36971	36973	36973	Susan	122	“ It did ; but they alter so , ”
36975	36993	37007	37007	her	380	“ Their hair gets darker , I know — but I was n't aware it lightened ever ? ”
36994	36998	37021	37021	Henchard	122	“ O yes . ”
37025	37113	37212	37212	She	128	“ Well , so much the better . Now Susan , I want to have her called Miss Henchard — not Miss Newson . Lots o ' people do it already in carelessness — it is her legal name — so it may as well be made her usual name — I do n't like t'other name at all for my own flesh and blood . I 'll advertise it in the Casterbridge paper — that 's the way they do it . She wo n't object . ”
37114	37122	37134	37134	he	122	“ No . O no . But — ”
37123	37133	37134	37134	he	122	“ Well , then , I shall do it , ”
37139	37156	37173	37173	she	1572	“ Surely , if she 's willing , you must wish it as much as I ? ”
37157	37172	37263	37263	Elizabeth	191	“ O yes — if she agrees let us do it by all means , ”
37242	37262	37276	37276	she	191	“ Can you agree — is it not a slight upon Newson — now he 's dead and gone ? ”
37266	37275	37330	37330	she	1572	“ I 'll think of it , mother , ”
37317	37329	37330	37330	she	1572	“ Do you wish this change so very much , sir ? ”
37333	37398	37543	37545	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Wish it ? Why , my blessed fathers , what an ado you women make about a trifle ! I proposed it — that 's all . Now , ' Lizabeth - Jane , just please yourself . Curse me if I care what you do . Now , you understand , do n't ' ee go agreeing to it to please me . ”
37505	37510	37543	37545	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ I 'll do't , ”
37512	37516	37866	37866	Henchard	120	“ you shall hae't ”
37858	37864	37866	37866	Henchard	120	“ ' Od damn it , ”
37868	37907	38897	38897	he	120	“ what 's all the world ! I like a fellow to talk to . Now come along and hae some supper , and do n't take too much thought about things , or ye'll drive me crazy . ”
38888	38896	38897	38897	he	120	“ Ah — it 's Miss Newson , ”
38909	38930	38937	38937	she	191	“ I did n't know you were there . I have kept the appointment , and am at your service . ”
38931	38936	38937	38937	she	191	“ O Mr. Farfrae , ”
38940	38961	38897	38897	he	120	“ so have I. But I did n't know it was you who wished to see me , otherwise I — ”
38962	38987	39005	39005	Elizabeth	191	“ I wished to see you ? O no — at least , that is , I am afraid there may be a mistake . ”
38988	39004	39044	39044	he	1654	“ Did n't you ask me to come here ? Did n't you write this ? ”
39011	39042	39044	39044	he	1654	“ No . Indeed , at no hand would I have thought of it ! And for you — did n't you ask me ? This is not your writing ? ”
39049	39054	39088	39088	they	1655	“ By no means . ”
39055	39083	39187	39187	Farfrae	149	“ And is that really so ! Then it 's somebody wanting to see us both . Perhaps we would do well to wait a little longer . ”
39175	39185	39187	39187	Farfrae	149	“ The person is not likely to be coming , ”
39189	39219	39229	39229	Elizabeth	191	“ It 's a trick perhaps , and if so , it 's a great pity to waste our time like this , and so much to be done . ”
39220	39227	39229	39229	Elizabeth	191	“ ' Tis a great liberty , ”
39231	39274	39284	39284	she	191	“ It 's true , Miss Newson . We 'll hear news of this some day depend on't , and who it was that did it . I would n't stand for it hindering myself ; but you , Miss Newson — — ”
39275	39283	39284	39284	she	191	“ I do n't mind — much , ”
39287	39291	39315	39315	she	191	“ Neither do I. ”
39298	39314	39315	39315	she	191	“ You are anxious to get back to Scotland , I suppose , Mr. Farfrae ? ”
39318	39330	39229	39229	Elizabeth	191	“ O no , Miss Newson . Why would I be ? ”
39331	39376	39397	39397	Donald	139	“ I only supposed you might be from the song you sang at the Three Mariners — about Scotland and home , I mean — which you seemed to feel so deep down in your heart ; so that we all felt for you . ”
39377	39394	39397	39397	Donald	139	“ Ay — and I did sing there — I did — — But , Miss Newson ”
39416	39500	39229	39229	Elizabeth	191	“ it 's well you feel a song for a few minutes , and your eyes they get quite tearful ; but you finish it , and for all you felt you do n't mind it or think of it again for a long while . O no , I do n't want to go back ! Yet I 'll sing the song to you wi ' pleasure whenever you like . I could sing it now , and not mind at all ? ”
39501	39518	39582	39582	his	1664	“ Thank you , indeed . But I fear I must go — rain or no . ”
39519	39579	39613	39613	he	1664	“ Ay ! Then , Miss Newson , ye had better say nothing about this hoax , and take no heed of it . And if the person should say anything to you , be civil to him or her , as if you did not mind it — so you 'll take the clever person 's laugh away . ”
39596	39612	39613	39613	he	1664	“ There 's husks and dust on you . Perhaps you do n't know it ? ”
39622	39658	39696	39696	Elizabeth	191	“ And it 's very bad to let rain come upon clothes when there 's chaff on them . It washes in and spoils them . Let me help you — blowing is the best . ”
39699	39705	39754	39754	he	1664	“ O , thank you , ”
39740	39753	39768	39768	Farfrae	139	“ Ah — now I 'll go and get ye an umbrella , ”

40146	40163	40164	40164	she	1665	“ It is the first time in my life that I have been so much admired , ”
40169	40183	40261	40261	she	1665	“ though perhaps it is by those whose admiration is not worth having . ”
40256	40260	40261	40261	she	1665	“ Good Heaven , ”
40264	40279	40308	40308	she	1665	“ can it be ? Here am I setting up as the town beauty ! ”
40298	40307	40308	40308	she	1665	“ There is something wrong in all this , ”
40311	40373	40520	40520	Henchard	120	“ If they only knew what an unfinished girl I am — that I ca n't talk Italian , or use globes , or show any of the accomplishments they learn at boarding schools , how they would despise me ! Better sell all this finery and buy myself grammar - books and dictionaries and a history of all the philosophies ! ”
40533	40539	40556	40556	he	120	“ Here — Abel Whittle ! ”
40550	40555	40556	40556	he	120	“ Yes , sir , ”
40572	40613	40621	40622	Abel Whittle	171	“ Once more — be in time to - morrow morning . You see what 's to be done , and you hear what I say , and you know I 'm not going to be trifled with any longer . ”
40614	40619	40924	40924	Abel	171	“ Yes , sir . ”
40910	40922	40924	40924	Abel	171	“ There is sommit wrong in my make , your worshipful ! ”
40926	41038	41050	41050	Henchard	120	“ especially in the inside , whereas my poor dumb brain gets as dead as a clot afore I 've said my few scrags of prayers . Yes — it came on as a stripling , just afore I 'd got man 's wages , whereas I never enjoy my bed at all , for no sooner do I lie down than I be asleep , and afore I be awake I be up . I 've fretted my gizzard green about it , maister , but what can I do ? Now last night , afore I went to bed , I only had a scantling o ' cheese and — ”
41039	41048	41050	41050	Henchard	120	“ I do n't want to hear it ! ”
41052	41081	41096	41096	Henchard	120	“ To - morrow the waggons must start at four , and if you 're not here , stand clear . I 'll mortify thy flesh for thee ! ”
41082	41095	41121	41121	Abel	171	“ But let me clear up my points , your worshipful — — ”
41100	41119	41121	41121	Abel	171	“ He asked me and he questioned me , and then ' a would n't hear my points ! ”
41129	41151	41200	41200	Henchard	120	“ Now , I shall twitch like a moment - hand all night to - night for fear o ' him ! ”
41207	41249	41363	41365	The unhappy Whittle	171	“ Where 's Abel Whittle ? Not come after all I 've said ? Now I 'll carry out my word , by my blessed fathers — nothing else will do him any good ! I 'm going up that way . ”
41324	41362	41473	41473	Farfrae	139	“ Out of bed , sir , and off to the granary , or you leave my employ to - day ! ' Tis to teach ye a lesson . March on ; never mind your breeches ! ”
41460	41471	41501	41501	Abel	171	“ For maircy 's sake , what object 's this ? ”
41492	41499	41501	41501	Abel	171	“ Ye see , Mr. Farfrae , ”
41509	41652	41835	41835	he	120	“ he said he 'd mortify my flesh if so be I did n't get up sooner , and now he 's a - doing on't ! Ye see it ca n't be helped , Mr. Farfrae ; things do happen queer sometimes ! Yes — I 'll go to Blackmoor Vale half naked as I be , since he do command ; but I shall kill myself afterwards ; I ca n't outlive the disgrace , for the women - folk will be looking out of their winders at my mortification all the way along , and laughing me to scorn as a man ' ithout breeches ! You know how I feel such things , Maister Farfrae , and how forlorn thoughts get hold upon me . Yes — I shall do myself harm — I feel it coming on ! ”
41653	41685	41835	41835	he	120	“ Get back home , and slip on your breeches , and come to wark like a man ! If ye go not , you 'll ha'e your death standing there ! ”
41686	41699	41501	41501	Abel	171	“ I 'm afeard I must n't ! Mr. Henchard said — — ”
41700	41729	41737	41737	Henchard	120	“ I do n't care what Mr. Henchard said , nor anybody else ! ' Tis simple foolishness to do this . Go and dress yourself instantly Whittle . ”
41730	41735	41737	41737	Henchard	120	“ Hullo , hullo ! ”
41743	41750	41764	41764	Donald	139	“ Who 's sending him back ? ”
41758	41762	41764	41764	Donald	139	“ I am , ”
41766	41777	41804	41804	Farfrae	139	“ I say this joke has been carried far enough . ”
41778	41794	41804	41804	Farfrae	139	“ And I say it has n't ! Get up in the waggon , Whittle . ”
41795	41802	41804	41804	Farfrae	139	“ Not if I am manager , ”
41806	41822	41871	41871	Donald	139	“ He either goes home , or I march out of this yard for good . ”
41866	41869	41871	41871	Donald	139	“ Come , ”
41874	41896	41905	41905	Henchard	120	“ a man o ' your position should ken better , sir ! It is tyrannical and no worthy of you . ”
41897	41903	41921	41921	He	120	“ ' Tis not tyrannical ! ”
41912	41920	41921	41921	He	120	“ It is to make him remember ! ”
41933	41987	41996	41996	Farfrae	139	“ Why did you speak to me before them like that , Farfrae ? You might have stopped till we were alone . Ah — I know why ! I 've told ye the secret o ' my life — fool that I was to do't — and you take advantage of me ! ”
41988	41994	42078	42078	he	1709	“ I had forgot it , ”
42082	42092	42183	42183	he	1716	“ Ask Mr. Farfrae . He 's master here ! ”
42178	42182	42183	42183	he	1716	“ Very well , ”
42186	42191	42202	42203	the child	306	“ I 'll come . ”
42192	42200	42218	42218	Henchard	120	“ But please will Mr. Farfrae come ? ”
42205	42216	42218	42218	Henchard	120	“ I am going that way .... Why Mr. Farfrae ? ”
42227	42236	42183	42183	he	1716	“ Why do people always want Mr. Farfrae ? ”
42237	42252	42183	42183	he	1716	“ I suppose because they like him so — that 's what they say . ”
42253	42301	42218	42218	Henchard	120	“ Oh — I see — that 's what they say — hey ? They like him because he 's cleverer than Mr. Henchard , and because he knows more ; and , in short , Mr. Henchard ca n't hold a candle to him — hey ? ”
42302	42316	42183	42183	he	1716	“ Yes — that 's just it , sir — some of it . ”
42317	42343	42183	42183	he	1716	“ Oh , there 's more ? Of course there 's more ! What besides ? Come , here 's a sixpence for a fairing . ”
42344	42442	42451	42451	Henchard	120	“ ' And he 's better tempered , and Henchard 's a fool to him , ' they say . And when some of the women were a - walking home they said , ' He 's a diment — he 's a chap o ' wax — he 's the best — he 's the horse for my money , ' says they . And they said , ' He 's the most understanding man o ' them two by long chalks . I wish he was the master instead of Henchard , ' they said . ”
42443	42450	42451	42451	Henchard	120	“ They 'll talk any nonsense , ”
42457	42479	42499	42499	He	120	“ Well , you can go now . And I am coming to value the hay , d'ye hear ? — I. ”
42488	42498	42533	42533	Donald	139	“ Wish he were master here , do they ? ”
42523	42532	42546	42546	Henchard	120	“ You 're no yoursel ' the day ? ”
42536	42544	42546	42546	Henchard	120	“ Yes , I am very well , ”
42548	42596	42615	42615	Henchard	120	“ But ye are a bit down — surely ye are down ? Why , there 's nothing to be angry about ! ' Tis splendid stuff that we 've got from Blackmoor Vale . By the by , the people in Durnover want their hay valued . ”
42597	42605	42615	42615	Henchard	120	“ Yes . I am going there . ”
42606	42613	42638	42638	he	1723	“ I 'll go with ye . ”
42643	42666	42682	42682	Henchard	120	“ Ah , as their father is dead I wo n't go on with such as that . How could I forget ? ”
42667	42680	42682	42682	Henchard	120	“ Do you care so very much about hurting folks ' feelings ? ”
42688	42698	42713	42713	Donald	139	“ You do , I know — especially mine ! ”
42699	42711	42730	42730	his	1723	“ I am sorry if I have hurt yours , sir , ”
42733	42743	42783	42783	he	1288	“ Why should you say it — think it ? ”
42772	42782	42783	42783	he	1288	“ I have been hearing things that vexed me , ”
42786	42856	43015	43015	He	4538	“ ' Twas that made me short in my manner — made me overlook what you really are . Now , I do n't want to go in here about this hay — Farfrae , you can do it better than I. They sent for ' ee , too . I have to attend a meeting of the Town Council at eleven , and ' tis drawing on for't . ”
43029	43052	43187	43187	Henchard	120	“ Hoy , Farfrae , boy , come and have some dinner with us ! Do n't sit here in solitary confinement ! ”
43177	43186	43372	43372	he	120	“ Have as many cloths as you like , ”
43377	43401	44192	44192	Henchard	120	“ Charge admission at so much a head — just like a Scotchman ! — who is going to pay anything a head ? ”
44183	44190	44192	44192	Henchard	120	“ But where are the folk ? ”
44219	44232	44247	44256	a Councilman who stood in the field with the Mayor	1773	“ The shops are all shut . Why do n't they come ? ”
44233	44245	44247	44256	a Councilman who stood in the field with the Mayor	1773	“ They are at Farfrae 's affair in the West Walk , ”
44258	44273	44192	44192	Henchard	120	“ A few , I suppose . But where are the body o 'em ? ”
44274	44282	44291	44291	Henchard	120	“ All out of doors are there . ”
44283	44290	44819	44819	one	1127	“ Then the more fools they ! ”
44804	44817	44844	44845	The other	338	“ Mr. Henchard 's rejoicings could n't say good morning to this , ”
44821	44843	45038	45039	this gentleman	1812	“ A man must be a headstrong stunpoll to think folk would go up to that bleak place to - day . ”
44865	45036	45057	45058	the other	338	“ Where would his business be if it were not for this young fellow ? ' Twas verily Fortune sent him to Henchard . His accounts were like a bramblewood when Mr. Farfrae came . He used to reckon his sacks by chalk strokes all in a row like garden - palings , measure his ricks by stretching with his arms , weigh his trusses by a lift , judge his hay by a chaw , and settle the price with a curse . But now this accomplished young man does it all by ciphering and mensuration . Then the wheat — that sometimes used to taste so strong o ' mice when made into bread that people could fairly tell the breed — Farfrae has a plan for purifying , so that nobody would dream the smallest four - legged beast had walked over it once . O yes , everybody is full of him , and the care Mr. Henchard has to keep him , to be sure ! ”
45041	45055	45067	45067	himself	120	“ But he wo n't do it for long , good - now , ”
45060	45063	45101	45101	He	120	“ No ! ”
45072	45100	45224	45225	Mr. Farfrae	149	“ Or if he do , he 'll be honeycombed clean out of all the character and standing that he 's built up in these eighteen year ! ”
45213	45218	45275	45275	he	149	“ Miss M'Leod of Ayr ”
45268	45274	45324	45324	He	149	“ Look here , Farfrae , ”
45285	45323	45358	45359	Alderman Tubber	176	“ I 'll go to Port - Bredy Great Market to - morrow myself . You can stay and put things right in your clothes - box , and recover strength to your knees after your vagaries . ”
45349	45356	45362	45362	his	176	“ What 's this , Henchard , ”
45375	45403	45413	45414	the lawyer	1820	“ An opposition randy to yours , eh ? Jack 's as good as his master , eh ? Cut ye out quite , has n't he ? ”
45404	45411	45413	45414	the lawyer	1820	“ You see , Mr. Henchard , ”
45420	45480	45501	45503	jocular Mr. Tubber	177	“ where you made the mistake was in going so far afield . You should have taken a leaf out of his book , and have had your sports in a sheltered place like this . But you did n't think of it , you see ; and he did , and that 's where he 's beat you . ”
45481	45499	45510	45510	Henchard	120	“ He 'll be top - sawyer soon of you two , and carry all afore him , ”
45505	45508	45530	45530	He	120	“ No , ”
45513	45529	45561	45563	The young man	371	“ He wo n't be that , because he 's shortly going to leave me . ”
45540	45560	45915	45915	he	4474	“ Mr. Farfrae 's time as my manager is drawing to a close — is n't it , Farfrae ? ”
45895	45914	45915	45915	he	4474	“ And it 's you , Miss Newson ? — and I 've been looking for ye everywhere ! ”
45931	45946	45984	45984	Farfrae	149	“ May I walk on with you as far as your street - corner ? ”
45987	46000	46001	46001	She	1827	“ It 's like that I 'm going to leave you soon . ”
46004	46007	46046	46046	She	1827	“ Why ? ”
46008	46045	46046	46046	She	1827	“ Oh — as a mere matter of business — nothing more . But we 'll not concern ourselves about it — it is for the best . I hoped to have another dance with you . ”
46058	46112	46153	46153	he	149	“ Nay , but you do ! It 's the feeling for it rather than the learning of steps that makes pleasant dancers .... I fear I offended your father by getting up this ! And now , perhaps , I 'll have to go to another part o ' the warrld altogether ! ”
46160	46205	46299	46299	Donald	139	“ I wish I was richer , Miss Newson ; and your stepfather had not been offended , I would ask you something in a short time — yes , I would ask you to - night . But that 's not for me ! ”
46275	46297	46299	46299	Donald	139	“ I never found out who it was that sent us to Durnover granary on a fool 's errand that day , ”
46306	46316	46322	46322	she	1827	“ Did ye ever know yourself , Miss Newson ? ”
46317	46320	46299	46299	Donald	139	“ Never , ”
46324	46332	46299	46299	Donald	139	“ I wonder why they did it ! ”
46333	46339	46299	46299	Donald	139	“ For fun , perhaps . ”
46340	46386	46397	46397	she	1827	“ Perhaps it was not for fun . It might have been that they thought they would like us to stay waiting there , talking to one another ? Ay , well ! I hope you Casterbridge folk will not forget me if I go . ”
46387	46396	46397	46397	she	1827	“ That I 'm sure we wo n't ! ”
46401	46412	46431	46432	Donald Farfrae	139	“ I — wish you would n't go at all . ”
46420	46429	46431	46432	Donald Farfrae	139	“ Now , I 'll think over that , ”
46434	46460	46515	46515	she	1827	“ And I 'll not come up to your door ; but part from you here ; lest it make your father more angry still . ”
46504	46514	46706	46706	she	191	“ O dear me — what am I at ? ”
46688	46692	46706	46706	she	191	“ Dear Sir , ”
46700	46705	46706	46706	she	191	“ Elizabeth - Jane , ”
46711	46714	46706	46706	she	191	“ Sir , ”
46718	46724	47065	47065	she	191	“ Dear Elizabeth - Jane . ”
47048	47064	47111	47111	she	191	“ just enough to make him silly , and not enough to keep him so , ”
47127	47143	47509	47509	His	1873	“ No , no , Elizabeth - Jane — such dreams are not for you ! ”
47313	47508	47626	47626	he	120	“ Well , he 's a friend of mine , and I 'm a friend of his — or if we are not , what are we ? ' Od send , if I 've not been his friend , who has , I should like to know ? Did n't he come here without a sound shoe to his voot ? Did n't I keep him here — help him to a living ? Did n't I help him to money , or whatever he wanted ? I stuck out for no terms — I said ' Name your own price . ' I 'd have shared my last crust with that young fellow at one time , I liked him so well . And now he 's defied me ! But damn him , I 'll have a tussle with him now — at fair buying and selling , mind — at fair buying and selling ! And if I ca n't overbid such a stripling as he , then I 'm not wo'th a varden ! We 'll show that we know our business as well as one here and there ! ”
47618	47625	47626	47626	he	120	“ Nothing to find fault with , ”
47633	47714	47758	47758	She	1880	“ Only I want to caution you , my dear . That man , Farfrae — it is about him . I 've seen him talking to you two or three times — he danced with ' ee at the rejoicings , and came home with ' ee . Now , now , no blame to you . But just harken : Have you made him any foolish promise ? Gone the least bit beyond sniff and snaff at all ? ”
47715	47724	47792	47792	she	1880	“ No . I have promised him nothing . ”
47725	47745	47626	47626	he	120	“ Good . All 's well that ends well . I particularly wish you not to see him again . ”
47746	47752	47758	47758	She	1880	“ Very well , sir . ”
47753	47757	47758	47758	She	1880	“ You promise ? ”
47768	47777	47792	47792	she	1880	“ Yes , if you much wish it . ”
47778	47790	48119	48119	Farfrae	139	“ I do . He 's an enemy to our house ! ”
48110	48117	48119	48119	Farfrae	139	“ He was once my friend , ”
48121	48159	48674	48674	Bellerophon	186	“ and it 's not for me to take business from him . I am sorry to disappoint you , but I can not hurt the trade of a man who 's been so kind to me . ”
48634	48637	48674	48674	Bellerophon	186	“ Henchard , ”
48638	48641	48674	48674	Bellerophon	186	“ Everdene , ”
48642	48645	48674	48674	Bellerophon	186	“ Shiner , ”
48646	48649	48667	48667	Henchard	178	“ Darton , ”
48658	48661	48733	48734	her husband	387	“ Farfrae , ”
48738	48749	48986	48986	she	1643	“ What — are you , too , my enemy ? ”
48978	48985	48986	48986	she	1643	“ On calm reflection , therefore , ”
48990	49078	49135	49135	my	0	“ I quite forgive you for landing me in such a dilemma , remembering that you concealed nothing before our ill - advised acquaintance ; and that you really did set before me in your grim way the fact of there being a certain risk in intimacy with you , slight as it seemed to be after fifteen or sixteen years of silence on your wife 's part . I thus look upon the whole as a misfortune of mine , and not a fault of yours . “
49139	49259	49277	49277	you	120	“ Now you will , I am sure , perceive that the one condition which will make any future happiness possible for me is that the past connection between our lives be kept secret outside this isle . Speak of it I know you will not ; and I can trust you not to write of it . One safe - guard more remains to be mentioned — that no writings of mine , or trifling articles belonging to me , should be left in your possession through neglect or forgetfulness . To this end may I request you to return to me any such you may have , particularly the letters written in the first abandonment of feeling . “
49279	49398	49445	49445	I	0	“ I am now on my way to Bristol , to see my only relative . She is rich , and I hope will do something for me . I shall return through Casterbridge and Budmouth , where I shall take the packet - boat . Can you meet me with the letters and other trifles ? I shall be in the coach which changes horses at the Antelope Hotel at half - past five Wednesday evening ; I shall be wearing a Paisley shawl with a red centre , and thus may easily be found . I should prefer this plan of receiving them to having them sent . — I remain still , yours ; ever , “
49400	49405	49729	49732	MR . MICHAEL HENCHARD	120	” Henchard breathed heavily . “
49453	49728	50003	50003	You	1940	” The contingency that he had in his mind was , of course , the death of Mrs. Henchard . As requested , he sealed up Lucetta 's letters , and put the parcel aside till the day she had appointed ; this plan of returning them by hand being apparently a little ruse of the young lady for exchanging a word or two with him on past times . He would have preferred not to see her ; but deeming that there could be no great harm in acquiescing thus far , he went at dusk and stood opposite the coach - office . The evening was chilly , and the coach was late . Henchard crossed over to it while the horses were being changed ; but there was no Lucetta inside or out . Concluding that something had happened to modify her arrangements he gave the matter up and went home , not without a sense of relief . Meanwhile Mrs. Henchard was weakening visibly . She could not go out of doors any more . One day , after much thinking which seemed to distress her , she said she wanted to write something . A desk was put upon her bed with pen and paper , and at her request she was left alone . She remained writing for a short time , folded her paper carefully , called Elizabeth - Jane to bring a taper and wax , and then , still refusing assistance , sealed up the sheet , directed it , and locked it in her desk . She had directed it in these words : — “
49747	49784	50003	50003	You	1940	” The latter sat up with her mother to the utmost of her strength night after night . To learn to take the universe seriously there is no quicker way than to watch — to be a “
49787	50002	50026	50026	you	1940	” as the country - people call it . Between the hours at which the last toss - pot went by and the first sparrow shook himself , the silence in Casterbridge — barring the rare sound of the watchman — was broken in Elizabeth 's ear only by the time - piece in the bedroom ticking frantically against the clock on the stairs ; ticking harder and harder till it seemed to clang like a gong ; and all this while the subtle - souled girl asking herself why she was born , why sitting in a room , and blinking at the candle ; why things around her had taken the shape they wore in preference to every other possible shape . Why they stared at her so helplessly , as if waiting for the touch of some wand that should release them from terrestrial constraint ; what that chaos called consciousness , which spun in her at this moment like a top , tended to , and began in . Her eyes fell together ; she was awake , yet she was asleep . A word from her mother roused her . Without preface , and as the continuation of a scene already progressing in her mind , Mrs. Henchard said : “
50038	50039	50026	50026	you	1940	” “
50042	50043	50063	50063	I	0	” “
50067	50068	50080	50080	I	0	” “
50071	50079	50086	50087	Mr. Farfrae	149	” said Elizabeth , with a start . “
50089	50090	50092	50092	mother	4495	” “
50094	50125	50092	50092	mother	4495	” Elizabeth - Jane bent down her head so much that she looked quite into her own lap . But as her mother did not go on , she said , “
50129	50130	50164	50164	Henchard	128	” “
50168	50169	50183	50183	I	0	” “
50177	50182	50362	50362	she	1945	” murmured the girl . “
50193	50360	50362	50362	she	1945	” After this her mother was silent , and dozed ; and she spoke on the subject no more . Some little time later on Farfrae was passing Henchard 's house on a Sunday morning , when he observed that the blinds were all down . He rang the bell so softly that it only sounded a single full note and a small one ; and then he was informed that Mrs. Henchard was dead — just dead — that very hour . At the town - pump there were gathered when he passed a few old inhabitants , who came there for water whenever they had , as at present , spare time to fetch it , because it was purer from that original fount than from their own wells . Mrs. Cuxsom , who had been standing there for an indefinite time with her pitcher , was describing the incidents of Mrs. Henchard 's death , as she had learnt them from the nurse . “
50370	50375	50588	50590	Elizabeth - Jane	191	” said Mrs. Cuxsom . “
50593	50594	50588	50590	Elizabeth - Jane	191	” “
50600	50601	50680	50680	he	4800	” “
50682	50683	50680	50680	he	4800	” “
50690	50695	50712	50712	I	0	” deprecated her listeners . “
50706	50711	50803	50803	I	0	” said Solomon Longways . “
50812	50813	50819	50819	she	1947	” “
50829	50834	50819	50819	she	1947	” answered Mother Cuxsom . “
50876	50876	50986	50986	Henchard	128	”
50973	50984	50996	50996	she	191	“ Elizabeth , do you think much of old times ? ”
50988	50995	50996	50996	she	191	“ Yes , sir ; often , ”
50999	51010	51021	51021	Henchard	128	“ Who do you put in your pictures of 'em ? ”
51011	51020	51031	51033	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Mother and father — nobody else hardly . ”
51039	51042	51058	51058	he	127	“ father . ”
51043	51057	51058	51058	he	127	“ Ah ! I am out of all that , am I not ? ”
51061	51068	51077	51077	Henchard	128	“ Was Newson a kind father ? ”
51069	51076	51104	51104	he	127	“ Yes , sir ; very . ”
51094	51103	51104	51104	he	127	“ Suppose I had been your real father ? ”
51107	51123	51132	51132	she	191	“ Would you have cared for me as much as you cared for Richard Newson ? ”
51124	51131	51132	51132	she	191	“ I ca n't think it , ”
51136	51151	51271	51271	he	127	“ I can think of no other as my father , except my father . ”
51257	51270	51271	51271	he	127	“ What did your mother tell you about me — my history ? ”
51274	51282	51362	51362	Henchard	128	“ That you were related by marriage . ”
51283	51340	51362	51362	Henchard	128	“ She should have told more — before you knew me ! Then my task would not have been such a hard one .... Elizabeth , it is I who am your father , and not Richard Newson . Shame alone prevented your wretched parents from owning this to you while both of 'em were alive . ”
51366	51429	51541	51541	Henchard	128	“ I 'd rather have your scorn , your fear , anything than your ignorance ; ' tis that I hate ! Your mother and I were man and wife when we were young . What you saw was our second marriage . Your mother was too honest . We had thought each other dead — and — Newson became her husband . ”
51530	51539	51592	51592	he	1963	“ Do n't cry — do n't cry ! ”
51547	51591	51592	51592	he	1963	“ I ca n't bear it , I wo n't bear it . I am your father ; why should you cry ? Am I so dreadful , so hateful to ' ee ? Do n't take against me , Elizabeth - Jane ! ”
51600	51647	51696	51696	Henchard	128	“ Do n't take against me — though I was a drinking man once , and used your mother roughly — I 'll be kinder to you than HE was ! I 'll do anything , if you will only look upon me as your father ! ”
51679	51694	51794	51794	He	1967	“ I do n't want you to come to me all of a sudden , ”
51710	51793	51850	51850	he	1967	“ No , Elizabeth , I do n't . I 'll go away and not see you till to - morrow , or when you like , and then I 'll show ' ee papers to prove my words . There , I am gone , and wo n't disturb you any more .... 'Twas I that chose your name , my daughter ; your mother wanted it Susan . There , do n't forget ' twas I gave you your name ! ”
51842	51849	51850	51850	he	1967	“ One word more , Elizabeth , ”
51853	51942	51959	51959	she	1970	“ You 'll take my surname now — hey ? Your mother was against it , but it will be much more pleasant to me . ' Tis legally yours , you know . But nobody need know that . You shall take it as if by choice . I 'll talk to my lawyer — I do n't know the law of it exactly ; but will you do this — let me put a few lines into the newspaper that such is to be your name ? ”
51943	51958	51850	51850	he	1967	“ If it is my name I must have it , must n't I ? ”
51962	51974	51850	51850	he	1967	“ Well , well ; usage is everything in these matters . ”
51975	51985	51850	51850	he	1967	“ I wonder why mother did n't wish it ? ”
51986	52021	52031	52031	she	1970	“ Oh , some whim of the poor soul 's . Now get a bit of paper and draw up a paragraph as I shall tell you . But let 's have a light . ”
52022	52030	51850	51850	he	1967	“ I can see by the firelight , ”
52034	52041	52047	52047	She	1970	“ Yes — I 'd rather . ”
52042	52046	52129	52129	Henchard	191	“ Very well . ”
52124	52127	52195	52195	He	1971	“ Now , ”
52154	52194	52476	52477	Mrs. Henchard	128	“ I 'll go upstairs and hunt for some documents that will prove it all to you . But I wo n't trouble you with them till to - morrow . Good - night , my Elizabeth - Jane ! ”
52461	52475	52594	52594	he	1971	“ NOT TO BE OPENED TILL ELIZABETH - JANE 'S WEDDING - DAY . ”
52579	52593	52859	52859	he	387	“ Some trifling fancy or other of poor Susan 's , I suppose , ”
52901	52910	52859	52859	he	387	“ I am to suffer , I perceive . ”
52911	52923	52997	52997	he	387	“ This much scourging , then , it is for me . ”
53001	53011	53747	53747	he	4474	“ Ah — I wonder if it is true ! ”
53750	53759	54016	54016	she	191	“ Why the deuce did I come here ! ”
54004	54015	54016	54016	she	191	“ I have thought and thought all night of it , ”
54020	54131	54155	54155	she	2042	“ And I see that everything must be as you say . And I am going to look upon you as the father that you are , and not to call you Mr. Henchard any more . It is so plain to me now . Indeed , father , it is . For , of course , you would not have done half the things you have done for me , and let me have my own way so entirely , and bought me presents , if I had only been your step - daughter ! He — Mr. Newson — whom my poor mother married by such a strange mistake ”
54144	54153	54190	54190	she	2042	“ was very kind — O so kind ! ”
54164	54189	54386	54386	she	191	“ but that is not the same thing as being one 's real father after all . Now , father , breakfast is ready ! ”
54403	54421	54431	54431	he	120	“ If you 'll bide where you be a minute , father , I 'll get it . ”
54422	54430	54431	54431	he	120	“ ' Bide where you be , ' ”
54435	54460	54481	54481	she	191	“ Good God , are you only fit to carry wash to a pig - trough , that ye use such words as those ? ”
54468	54480	54481	54481	she	191	“ I meant ' Stay where you are , ' father , ”
54491	54500	54534	54534	she	191	“ I ought to have been more careful . ”

54815	54835	54944	54944	he	4556	“ Now then — ' An agreement entered into this sixteenth day of October ' — write that first . ”
54957	54966	55003	55003	She	191	“ Never mind — I 'll finish it , ”
55013	55022	55071	55071	Henchard	191	“ Not to make Phoebe come up twice . ”
55076	55113	55408	55408	Henchard	191	“ Good God , why dostn't leave off thanking that girl as if she were a goddess - born ! Do n't I pay her a dozen pound a year to do things for ' ee ? ”
55400	55406	55424	55424	he	2067	“ Elizabeth , come here ! ”
55414	55423	55424	55424	he	2067	“ Why do you lower yourself so confoundedly ? ”
55430	55466	55498	55498	she	158	“ Have n't I told you o't fifty times ? Hey ? Making yourself a drudge for a common workwoman of such a character as hers ! Why , ye'll disgrace me to the dust ! ”
55504	55523	55537	55537	Henchard	120	“ Come to that , Mr. Henchard , I can let ' ee know she've waited on worse ! ”
55524	55535	55537	55537	Henchard	120	“ Then she must have had more charity than sense , ”
55539	55566	55575	55575	Henchard	120	“ O no , she had n't . ' Twere not for charity but for hire ; and at a public - house in this town ! ”
55567	55573	55585	55585	Nance	158	“ It is not true ! ”
55578	55583	55635	55635	he	120	“ Just ask her , ”
55628	55634	55635	55635	he	120	“ What does this mean ? ”
55640	55645	55653	55655	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Anything or nothing ? ”
55646	55651	55653	55655	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ It is true , ”

55664	55679	55700	55700	Nance	158	“ Did you do it , or did n't you ? Where was it ? ”
55680	55699	55962	55962	she	191	“ At the Three Mariners ; one evening for a little while , when we were staying there . ”

57031	57040	57041	57041	he	2124	“ I WON'T have you talk like that ! ”
57044	57100	57184	57184	he	2124	“ ' Leery , ' indeed . One would think you worked upon a farm ! One day I learn that you lend a hand in public - houses . Then I hear you talk like a clodhopper . I 'm burned , if it goes on , this house ca n't hold us two . ”
57202	57237	57413	57413	her	2110	“ Ah ! he 'll think it means peace , and a marriage portion — not that I do n't want my house to be troubled with her , and no portion at all ! ”
57418	57430	57521	57522	the lady	2110	“ O , I wish I was dead with dear mother ! ”
57512	57519	57521	57522	the lady	2110	“ Yes , I heard you , ”
57533	57539	57553	57553	Elizabeth	191	“ What can have happened ? ”
57540	57551	57606	57607	the latter	4511	“ I do n't — I ca n't tell you , ”
57595	57604	57616	57616	She	4876	“ I guess how it is with you , ”
57609	57615	57667	57667	she	311	“ That was your mother . ”
57660	57666	57667	57667	she	311	“ It was my mother , ”
57670	57675	57640	57641	The lady	2110	“ my only friend . ”
57676	57688	57698	57700	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ But your father , Mr. Henchard . He is living ? ”
57689	57696	57698	57700	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Yes , he is living , ”
57702	57710	57640	57641	The lady	2110	“ Is he not kind to you ? ”
57711	57721	57640	57641	The lady	2110	“ I 've no wish to complain of him . ”
57722	57729	57698	57700	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ There has been a disagreement ? ”
57730	57734	57744	57745	the stranger	2118	“ A little . ”
57735	57742	57757	57759	the meek Elizabeth	191	“ Perhaps you were to blame , ”
57747	57755	57757	57759	the meek Elizabeth	191	“ I was — in many ways , ”
57761	57791	57815	57815	she	191	“ I swept up the coals when the servants ought to have done it ; and I said I was leery ; — and he was angry with me . ”
57803	57814	57815	57815	she	191	“ Do you know the impression your words give me ? ”
57819	57842	57866	57868	the honest girl	2157	“ That he is a hot - tempered man — a little proud — perhaps ambitious ; but not a bad man . ”
57856	57864	57866	57868	the honest girl	2157	“ O no ; certainly not BAD , ”
57870	57919	57927	57929	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ And he has not even been unkind to me till lately — since mother died . But it has been very much to bear while it has lasted . All is owing to my defects , I daresay ; and my defects are owing to my history . ”
57920	57926	57970	57970	she	191	“ What is your history ? ”
57960	57969	57970	57970	she	191	“ My history is not gay or attractive , ”
57973	57988	58089	58089	she	311	“ And yet I can tell it , if you really want to know . ”
58079	58088	58089	58089	she	311	“ I do n't know how to return , ”
58092	58110	58121	58122	her friend	2164	“ I think of going away . But what can I do ? Where can I go ? ”
58111	58119	58121	58122	her friend	2164	“ Perhaps it will be better soon , ”
58125	58170	58177	58177	Elizabeth	191	“ So I would not go far . Now what do you think of this : I shall soon want somebody to live in my house , partly as housekeeper , partly as companion ; would you mind coming to me ? But perhaps — ”
58171	58175	58177	58177	Elizabeth	191	“ O yes , ”
58185	58214	58121	58122	her friend	2164	“ I would , indeed — I would do anything to be independent ; for then perhaps my father might get to love me . But , ah ! ”
58215	58218	58121	58122	her friend	2164	“ What ? ”
58219	58235	58121	58122	her friend	2164	“ I am no accomplished person . And a companion to you must be that . ”
58236	58242	58121	58122	her friend	2164	“ O , not necessarily . ”
58243	58263	58121	58122	her friend	2164	“ Not ? But I ca n't help using rural words sometimes , when I do n't mean to . ”
58264	58275	58121	58122	her friend	2164	“ Never mind , I shall like to know them . ”
58276	58288	58290	58290	she	191	“ And — O , I know I sha n't do ! ”
58297	58323	58121	58122	her friend	2164	“ I accidentally learned to write round hand instead of ladies'-hand . And , of course , you want some one who can write that ? ”
58324	58329	58341	58343	the joyous Elizabeth	191	“ Well , no . ”
58330	58339	58341	58343	the joyous Elizabeth	191	“ What , not necessary to write ladies'-hand ? ”
58345	58350	58121	58122	her friend	2164	“ Not at all . ”
58351	58358	58378	58378	Elizabeth	191	“ But where do you live ? ”
58359	58377	58484	58484	Elizabeth	191	“ In Casterbridge , or rather I shall be living here after twelve o'clock to - day . ”
58383	58483	58914	58914	his	2191	“ I have been staying at Budmouth for a few days while my house was getting ready . The house I am going into is that one they call High - Place Hall — the old stone one looking down the lane to the market . Two or three rooms are fit for occupation , though not all : I sleep there to - night for the first time . Now will you think over my proposal , and meet me here the first fine day next week , and say if you are still in the same mind ? ”
58902	58911	59853	59853	she	191	“ Blood built it , and Wealth enjoys it ”
59840	59852	59853	59853	she	191	“ Father , have you any objection to my going away ? ”
59856	59870	59922	59922	she	191	“ Going away ! No — none whatever . Where are you going ? ”
59902	59921	59922	59922	she	191	“ I have heard of an opportunity of getting more cultivated and finished , and being less idle , ”
59928	59950	59999	59999	he	2227	“ A chance of a place in a household where I can have advantages of study , and seeing refined life . ”
59951	59974	59999	59999	he	2227	“ Then make the best of it , in Heaven 's name — if you ca n't get cultivated where you are . ”
59975	59981	59922	59922	she	191	“ You do n't object ? ”
59982	59995	59999	59999	he	2227	“ Object — I ? Ho — no ! Not at all . ”
60002	60054	60071	60071	he	2227	“ But you wo n't have enough money for this lively scheme without help , you know ? If you like I should be willing to make you an allowance , so that you not be bound to live upon the starvation wages refined folk are likely to pay ' ee . ”
60062	60070	60071	60071	he	2227	“ It had better be done properly , ”
60077	60113	60071	60071	he	2227	“ A small annuity is what I should like you to have — so as to be independent of me — and so that I may be independent of you . Would that please ye ? ”
60114	60117	60130	60130	He	2227	“ Certainly . ”
60118	60129	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ Then I 'll see about it this very day . ”
60478	60481	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ Well , ”
60507	60512	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ have you decided ? ”
60513	60518	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ Yes , quite , ”
60524	60530	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ Your father is willing ? ”
60531	60534	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ Yes . ”
60535	60540	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ Then come along . ”
60541	60544	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ When ? ”
60545	60598	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ Now — as soon as you like . I had a good mind to send to you to come to my house , thinking you might not venture up here in the wind . But as I like getting out of doors , I thought I would come and see first . ”
60599	60606	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ It was my own thought . ”
60607	60637	60649	60650	the girl	311	“ That shows we shall agree . Then can you come to - day ? My house is so hollow and dismal that I want some living thing there . ”
60638	60647	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ I think I might be able to , ”
60681	60684	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ sacks , ”
60685	60688	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ quarters , ”
60689	60692	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ threshing , ”
60693	60696	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ tailing , ”
60697	60703	60731	60732	the lady	2110	“ next Saturday 's market , ”
60724	60729	60731	60732	the lady	2110	“ Who are those ? ”
60734	60747	60768	60768	she	2110	“ One is my father . He rents that yard and barn . ”
60772	60783	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ Did you tell him where you were going to ? ”
60784	60787	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ No . ”
60788	60795	60768	60768	she	2110	“ O — how was that ? ”
60796	60815	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ I thought it safer to get away first — as he is so uncertain in his temper . ”
60816	60846	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ Perhaps you are right .... Besides , I have never told you my name . It is Miss Templeman .... Are they gone — on the other side ? ”
60847	60859	60768	60768	she	2110	“ No . They have only gone up into the granary . ”
60860	60885	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ Well , it is getting damp here . I shall expect you to - day — this evening , say , at six . ”
60886	60895	60483	60484	the lady	2110	“ Which way shall I come , ma'am ? ”
60896	60915	60916	60918	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ The front way — round by the gate . There is no other that I have noticed . ”
60929	60964	60982	60982	she	191	“ Perhaps , as you have not mentioned your destination , you may as well keep silent upon it till you are clear off . Who knows but that he may alter his mind ? ”
60972	60981	60982	60982	she	191	“ On consideration I do n't fear it , ”
60986	60995	60969	60969	her	191	“ He has grown quite cold to me . ”
60996	61004	61175	61175	she	2070	“ Very well . Six o'clock then . ”
61164	61174	61175	61175	she	2070	“ But you said I might go , father ? ”
61182	61232	61251	61251	she	2070	“ Said ! — yes . But I thought you meant next month , or next year . ' Od , seize it — you take time by the forelock ! This , then , is how you be going to treat me for all my trouble about ye ? ”
61233	61250	61267	61267	he	2273	“ O father ! how can you speak like that ? It is unjust of you ! ”
61256	61266	61371	61371	he	2273	“ Well , well , have your own way , ”
61366	61370	61371	61371	he	2273	“ Look here , ”
61387	61424	61430	61430	she	2070	“ do n't ' ee go away from me . It may be I 've spoke roughly to you — but I 've been grieved beyond everything by you — there 's something that caused it . ”
61425	61429	61430	61430	she	2070	“ By me ? ”
61437	61443	61371	61371	he	2273	“ What have I done ? ”
61444	61474	61515	61515	she	2070	“ I ca n't tell you now . But if you 'll stop , and go on living as my daughter , I 'll tell you all in time . ”
61511	61514	61515	61515	she	2070	“ Father , ”
61524	61563	61564	61564	He	2284	“ I think it best for us that I go on now . I need not stay long ; I shall not be far away , and if you want me badly I can soon come back again . ”
61580	61612	61643	61643	She	2070	“ You are not going far , you say . What will be your address , in case I wish to write to you ? Or am I not to know ? ”
61613	61631	61637	61637	Henchard	191	“ Oh yes — certainly . It is only in the town — High - Place Hall ! ”
61632	61635	62119	62119	He	188	“ Where ? ”
62132	62142	62159	62160	his informant	2307	“ Who is coming to live at the Hall ? ”
62143	62157	62178	62178	he	188	“ A lady of the name of Templeman , I believe , sir , ”
62167	62177	62178	62178	he	188	“ Lucetta is related to her , I suppose , ”
62183	62197	62332	62334	Miss Le Sueur	204	“ Yes , I must put her in her proper position , undoubtedly . ”
62347	62350	62594	62594	she	2324	“ Lucette , ”
62587	62593	62594	62594	she	2324	“ I am in residence , ”
62597	62690	62917	62917	LUCETTA	188	“ and comfortable , though getting here has been a wearisome undertaking . You probably know what I am going to tell you , or do you not ? My good Aunt Templeman , the banker 's widow , whose very existence you used to doubt , much more her affluence , has lately died , and bequeathed some of her property to me . I will not enter into details except to say that I have taken her name — as a means of escape from mine , and its wrongs . “
62764	62916	62917	62917	LUCETTA	188	“ You probably are aware of my arrangement with your daughter , and have doubtless laughed at the — what shall I call it ? — practical joke ( in all affection ) of my getting her to live with me . But my first meeting with her was purely an accident . Do you see , Michael , partly why I have done it ? — why , to give you an excuse for coming here as if to visit HER , and thus to form my acquaintance naturally . She is a dear , good girl , and she thinks you have treated her with undue severity . You may have done so in your haste , but not deliberately , I am sure . As the result has been to bring her to me I am not disposed to upbraid you . — In haste , yours always , “
62919	63047	63048	63051	The artful little woman	2328	” The excitement which these announcements produced in Henchard 's gloomy soul was to him most pleasurable . He sat over his dining - table long and dreamily , and by an almost mechanical transfer the sentiments which had run to waste since his estrangement from Elizabeth - Jane and Donald Farfrae gathered around Lucetta before they had grown dry . She was plainly in a very coming - on disposition for marriage . But what else could a poor woman be who had given her time and her heart to him so thoughtlessly , at that former time , as to lose her credit by it ? Probably conscience no less than affection had brought her here . On the whole he did not blame her . “
63053	63140	63146	63146	herself	2328	” he said , smiling ( with reference to Lucetta 's adroit and pleasant manoeuvre with Elizabeth - Jane ) . To feel that he would like to see Lucetta was with Henchard to start for her house . He put on his hat and went . It was between eight and nine o'clock when he reached her door . The answer brought him was that Miss Templeman was engaged for that evening ; but that she would be happy to see him the next day . “
63149	63153	63157	63157	we	2329	” he thought . “
63159	63187	63157	63157	we	2329	” But after all , she plainly had not expected him , and he took the refusal quietly . Nevertheless he resolved not to go next day . “
63203	63449	63452	63452	you	2331	” he said . Let us follow the train of Mr. Henchard 's thought as if it were a clue line , and view the interior of High - Place Hall on this particular evening . On Elizabeth - Jane 's arrival she had been phlegmatically asked by an elderly woman to go upstairs and take off her things . She replied with great earnestness that she would not think of giving that trouble , and on the instant divested herself of her bonnet and cloak in the passage . She was then conducted to the first floor on the landing , and left to find her way further alone . The room disclosed was prettily furnished as a boudoir or small drawing - room , and on a sofa with two cylindrical pillows reclined a dark - haired , large - eyed , pretty woman , of unmistakably French extraction on one side or the other . She was probably some years older than Elizabeth , and had a sparkling light in her eye . In front of the sofa was a small table , with a pack of cards scattered upon it faces upward . The attitude had been so full of abandonment that she bounded up like a spring on hearing the door open . Perceiving that it was Elizabeth she lapsed into ease , and came across to her with a reckless skip that innate grace only prevented from being boisterous . “
63456	63469	63452	63452	you	2331	” she said , taking hold of Elizabeth - Jane 's hands . “
63480	63481	63550	63550	you	2331	” “
63516	63546	63550	63550	you	2331	” She gathered up the pack of cards , pulled the table in front of her , and began to deal them rapidly , telling Elizabeth to choose some . “
63553	63562	63550	63550	you	2331	” she asked flinging down the last card . “
63565	63575	63595	63595	I	0	” stammered Elizabeth , arousing herself from a reverie . “
63599	63616	63595	63595	I	0	” Miss Templeman looked at Elizabeth - Jane with interest , and laid down the cards . “
63622	63626	63638	63638	we	2332	” she said . “
63642	63733	63734	63734	I	0	” Elizabeth drew up silently to the head of the sofa , but with obvious pleasure . It could be seen that though in years she was younger than her entertainer in manner and general vision she seemed more of the sage . Miss Templeman deposited herself on the sofa in her former flexuous position , and throwing her arm above her brow — somewhat in the pose of a well - known conception of Titian 's — talked up at Elizabeth - Jane invertedly across her forehead and arm . “
63740	63744	63753	63753	I	0	” she said . “
63768	63769	63753	63753	I	0	” “
63777	63788	63827	63827	I	0	” murmured Elizabeth - Jane , her countenance slightly falling . “
63838	63839	63827	63827	I	0	” “
63844	63919	63920	63920	You	2331	” She looked thoughtfully round the room — at the little square piano with brass inlayings , at the window - curtains , at the lamp , at the fair and dark kings and queens on the card - table , and finally at the inverted face of Lucetta Templeman , whose large lustrous eyes had such an odd effect upside down . Elizabeth 's mind ran on acquirements to an almost morbid degree . “
63930	63934	63827	63827	I	0	” she said . “
63950	63951	64001	64001	they	2341	” “
63977	63978	64001	64001	they	2341	” “
63985	63997	64266	64266	Thy	2351	” It was with rather more reluctance that Miss Templeman said , “
64111	64265	64266	64266	Thy	2351	” Lucetta 's tongue had for a moment outrun her discretion . She had arrived at Casterbridge as a Bath lady , and there were obvious reasons why Jersey should drop out of her life . But Elizabeth had tempted her to make free , and a deliberately formed resolve had been broken . It could not , however , have been broken in safer company . Lucetta 's words went no further , and after this day she was so much upon her guard that there appeared no chance of her identification with the young Jersey woman who had been Henchard 's dear comrade at a critical time . Not the least amusing of her safeguards was her resolute avoidance of a French word if one by accident came to her tongue more readily than its English equivalent . She shirked it with the suddenness of the weak Apostle at the accusation , “
64271	64765	64266	64266	Thy	2351	” Expectancy sat visibly upon Lucetta the next morning . She dressed herself for Mr. Henchard , and restlessly awaited his call before mid - day ; as he did not come she waited on through the afternoon . But she did not tell Elizabeth that the person expected was the girl 's stepfather . They sat in adjoining windows of the same room in Lucetta 's great stone mansion , netting , and looking out upon the market , which formed an animated scene . Elizabeth could see the crown of her stepfather 's hat among the rest beneath , and was not aware that Lucetta watched the same object with yet intenser interest . He moved about amid the throng , at this point lively as an ant - hill ; elsewhere more reposeful , and broken up by stalls of fruit and vegetables . The farmers as a rule preferred the open carrefour for their transactions , despite its inconvenient jostlings and the danger from crossing vehicles , to the gloomy sheltered market - room provided for them . Here they surged on this one day of the week , forming a little world of leggings , switches , and sample - bags ; men of extensive stomachs , sloping like mountain sides ; men whose heads in walking swayed as the trees in November gales ; who in conversing varied their attitudes much , lowering themselves by spreading their knees , and thrusting their hands into the pockets of remote inner jackets . Their faces radiated tropical warmth ; for though when at home their countenances varied with the seasons , their market - faces all the year round were glowing little fires . All over - clothes here were worn as if they were an inconvenience , a hampering necessity . Some men were well dressed ; but the majority were careless in that respect , appearing in suits which were historical records of their wearer 's deeds , sun - scorchings , and daily struggles for many years past . Yet many carried ruffled cheque - books in their pockets which regulated at the bank hard by a balance of never less than four figures . In fact , what these gibbous human shapes specially represented was ready money — money insistently ready — not ready next year like a nobleman 's — often not merely ready at the bank like a professional man 's , but ready in their large plump hands . It happened that to - day there rose in the midst of them all two or three tall apple - trees standing as if they grew on the spot ; till it was perceived that they were held by men from the cider - districts who came here to sell them , bringing the clay of their county on their boots . Elizabeth - Jane , who had often observed them , said , “
64776	64777	64266	64266	Thy	2351	” “
64781	64836	64266	64266	Thy	2351	” said Lucetta , absorbed in watching for Henchard . Elizabeth replied vaguely , for an incident checked her . Behind one of the trees stood Farfrae , briskly discussing a sample - bag with a farmer . Henchard had come up , accidentally encountering the young man , whose face seemed to inquire , “
64844	64857	64266	64266	Thy	2351	” She saw her stepfather throw a shine into his eye which answered “
64860	64866	64868	64868	you	2354	” Elizabeth - Jane sighed . “
64876	64880	64868	64868	you	2354	” said Lucetta . “
64885	64917	64868	64868	you	2354	” said her companion , a quick red shooting over her face . Luckily Farfrae 's figure was immediately covered by the apple - tree . Lucetta looked hard at her . “
64921	64925	64868	64868	you	2354	” she said . “
64929	64940	64944	64944	farmers	712	” said Elizabeth - Jane . Again Lucetta looked out . “
64949	64953	65229	65230	your father	5032	” she said . “
64999	65226	65267	65267	He	5032	” Farfrae stood out quite distinctly now ; but she did not mention him . The Saturday afternoon slipped on thus desultorily . The market changed from the sample - showing hour to the idle hour before starting homewards , when tales were told . Henchard had not called on Lucetta though he had stood so near . He must have been too busy , she thought . He would come on Sunday or Monday . The days came but not the visitor , though Lucetta repeated her dressing with scrupulous care . She got disheartened . It may at once be declared that Lucetta no longer bore towards Henchard all that warm allegiance which had characterized her in their first acquaintance , the then unfortunate issue of things had chilled pure love considerably . But there remained a conscientious wish to bring about her union with him , now that there was nothing to hinder it — to right her position — which in itself was a happiness to sigh for . With strong social reasons on her side why their marriage should take place there had ceased to be any worldly reason on his why it should be postponed , since she had succeeded to fortune . Tuesday was the great Candlemas fair . At breakfast she said to Elizabeth - Jane quite coolly : “
65260	65266	65267	65267	He	5032	” She shook her head . “
65272	65273	65278	65278	He	5032	” “
65276	65277	65278	65278	He	5032	” “
65284	65292	65293	65293	You	2363	” she said in a husky voice . “
65303	65325	65293	65293	You	2363	” Elizabeth , wishing to shield the man she believed to be her father from any charge of unnatural dislike , said “
65328	65329	65293	65293	You	2363	” “
65346	65380	65385	65386	Miss Templeman	203	” Elizabeth nodded sadly . Lucetta looked blank , twitched up her lovely eyebrows and lip , and burst into hysterical sobs . Here was a disaster — her ingenious scheme completely stultified . “
65393	65398	65399	65399	I	0	” cried her companion . “
65405	65416	65424	65424	I	0	” said Lucetta , as soon as she could speak . “
65427	65433	65492	65493	Miss Henchard	166	” Elizabeth chimed in soothingly . “
65438	65491	65521	65521	you	166	” She could not finish the sentence , which was , naturally , that if Henchard had such a rooted dislike for the girl as now seemed to be the case , Elizabeth - Jane would have to be got rid of — a disagreeable necessity . A provisional resource suggested itself . “
65526	65552	65521	65521	you	166	” Here she enumerated several commissions at sundry shops , which would occupy Elizabeth 's time for the next hour or two , at least . “
65561	65568	65659	65659	I	0	” Elizabeth - Jane had not . “
65648	65658	65662	65662	she	2373	” Elizabeth hastily put on her things and departed . “
65673	66115	66211	66211	Lucetta	214	” she said sorrowfully as she went . That her absence , rather than her services or instruction , was in request , had been readily apparent to Elizabeth - Jane , simple as she seemed , and difficult as it was to attribute a motive for the desire . She had not been gone ten minutes when one of Lucetta 's servants was sent to Henchard 's with a note . The contents were briefly : — DEAR MICHAEL , — You will be standing in view of my house to - day for two or three hours in the course of your business , so do please call and see me . I am sadly disappointed that you have not come before , for can I help anxiety about my own equivocal relation to you ? — especially now my aunt 's fortune has brought me more prominently before society ? Your daughter 's presence here may be the cause of your neglect ; and I have therefore sent her away for the morning . Say you come on business — I shall be quite alone . LUCETTA . When the messenger returned her mistress gave directions that if a gentleman called he was to be admitted at once , and sat down to await results . Sentimentally she did not much care to see him — his delays had wearied her , but it was necessary ; and with a sigh she arranged herself picturesquely in the chair ; first this way , then that ; next so that the light fell over her head . Next she flung herself on the couch in the cyma - recta curve which so became her , and with her arm over her brow looked towards the door . This , she decided , was the best position after all , and thus she remained till a man 's step was heard on the stairs . Whereupon Lucetta , forgetting her curve ( for Nature was too strong for Art as yet ) , jumped up and ran and hid herself behind one of the window - curtains in a freak of timidity . In spite of the waning of passion the situation was an agitating one — she had not seen Henchard since his ( supposed ) temporary parting from her in Jersey . She could hear the servant showing the visitor into the room , shutting the door upon him , and leaving as if to go and look for her mistress . Lucetta flung back the curtain with a nervous greeting . The man before her was not Henchard .
66228	66237	66260	66260	he	2375	“ O , I 've made a mistake ! ”
66252	66259	66260	66260	he	2375	“ But I 'm very sorry ! ”
66267	66300	66309	66309	she	214	“ I came and I inquired for Miss Henchard , and they showed me up here , and in no case would I have caught ye so unmannerly if I had known ! ”
66301	66308	66329	66330	Mr. Farfrae	149	“ I was the unmannerly one , ”
66312	66327	66370	66370	Lucetta	214	“ But is it that I have come to the wrong house , madam ? ”
66347	66368	66370	66370	Lucetta	214	“ O no , sir , — sit down . You must come and sit down now you are here , ”
66378	66386	66670	66670	she	191	“ Miss Henchard will be here directly . ”
66658	66669	66709	66709	He	149	“ The fair to - day seems a large one , ”
66686	66708	66753	66753	he	149	“ Your numerous fairs and markets keep me interested . How many things I think of while I watch from here ! ”
66745	66752	66753	66753	he	149	“ Do you look out often ? ”
66756	66762	66776	66776	she	191	“ Yes — very often . ”
66763	66773	66795	66795	she	191	“ Do you look for any one you know ? ”
66783	66794	66795	66795	she	191	“ I look as at a picture merely . But , ”
66804	66883	66753	66753	he	149	“ I may do so now — I may look for you . You are always there , are you not ? Ah — I do n't mean it seriously ! But it is amusing to look for somebody one knows in a crowd , even if one does not want him . It takes off the terrible oppressiveness of being surrounded by a throng , and having no point of junction with it through a single individual . ”
66884	66896	66776	66776	she	191	“ Ay ! Maybe you 'll be very lonely , ma'am ? ”
66897	66903	66795	66795	she	191	“ Nobody knows how lonely . ”
66904	66913	66753	66753	he	149	“ But you are rich , they say ? ”
66914	66947	66753	66753	he	149	“ If so , I do n't know how to enjoy my riches . I came to Casterbridge thinking I should like to live here . But I wonder if I shall . ”
66948	66957	66795	66795	she	191	“ Where did ye come from , ma'am ? ”
66958	66964	66974	66974	he	2391	“ The neighbourhood of Bath . ”
66965	66973	67027	67027	he	2391	“ And I from near Edinboro ' , ”
66977	67026	67138	67138	Farfrae	149	“ It 's better to stay at home , and that 's true ; but a man must live where his money is made . It is a great pity , but it 's always so ! Yet I 've done very well this year . O yes , ”
67034	67136	67141	67141	his	149	“ You see that man with the drab kerseymere coat ? I bought largely of him in the autumn when wheat was down , and then afterwards when it rose a little I sold off all I had ! It brought only a small profit to me ; while the farmers kept theirs , expecting higher figures — yes , though the rats were gnawing the ricks hollow . Just when I sold the markets went lower , and I bought up the corn of those who had been holding back at less price than my first purchases . And then , ”
67145	67184	67141	67141	his	149	“ I sold it a few weeks after , when it happened to go up again ! And so , by contenting mysel ' with small profits frequently repeated , I soon made five hundred pounds — yes ! ”
67203	67217	67262	67262	he	149	“ while the others by keeping theirs in hand made nothing at all ! ”
67251	67261	67265	67265	She	214	“ Ay , now , I 'm wearying you ! ”
67268	67273	67265	67265	She	214	“ No , indeed , ”
67278	67282	67265	67265	She	214	“ What then ? ”
67283	67292	67311	67311	she	214	“ Quite otherwise . You are most interesting . ”
67303	67310	67311	67311	she	214	“ I mean all you Scotchmen , ”
67317	67356	67265	67265	She	214	“ So free from Southern extremes . We common people are all one way or the other — warm or cold , passionate or frigid . You have both temperatures going on in you at the same time . ”
67357	67374	67265	67265	She	214	“ But how do you mean that ? Ye were best to explain clearly , ma'am . ”
67375	67404	67415	67415	he	149	“ You are animated — then you are thinking of getting on . You are sad the next moment — then you are thinking of Scotland and friends . ”
67405	67414	67415	67415	he	149	“ Yes . I think of home sometimes ! ”
67419	67462	67512	67512	She	214	“ So do I — as far as I can . But it was an old house where I was born , and they pulled it down for improvements , so I seem hardly to have any home to think of now . ”
67487	67511	67529	67529	he	2396	“ But the mountains , and the mists and the rocks , they are there ! And do n't they seem like home ? ”
67517	67528	67611	67611	she	214	“ They do to me — they do to me , ”
67601	67610	67623	67623	Farfrae	149	“ You are wishing you were back again , ”
67614	67621	67997	67999	the young man	371	“ Ah , no , ma'am , ”
67985	67995	67997	67999	the young man	371	“ I 'm sorry to leave ye , Nelly , ”
68003	68035	68049	68049	she	311	“ But , you see , I ca n't starve father , and he 's out o ' work at Lady - day . ' Tis only thirty - five mile . ”
68042	68048	68049	68049	she	311	“ Thirty - five mile ! ”
68052	68067	68107	68107	she	311	“ Ah ! ' tis enough ! I shall never see ' ee again ! ”
68095	68106	68190	68190	she	311	“ O ! no , no — I never shall , ”
68183	68189	68190	68190	she	311	“ It is very hard , ”
68196	68225	68240	68240	Farfrae	149	“ Lovers ought not to be parted like that ! O , if I had my wish , I 'd let people live and love at their pleasure ! ”
68226	68238	68240	68240	Farfrae	149	“ Maybe I can manage that they 'll not be parted , ”
68242	68277	68287	68287	she	311	“ I want a young carter ; and perhaps I 'll take the old man too — yes ; he 'll not be very expensive , and doubtless he will answer my pairrpose somehow . ”
68278	68286	68287	68287	she	311	“ O , you are so good ! ”
68292	68307	68355	68355	Lucetta	214	“ Go and tell them , and let me know if you have succeeded ! ”
68342	68353	68355	68355	Lucetta	214	“ It is kind - hearted of you , indeed , ”
68357	68383	68407	68407	he	149	“ For my part , I have resolved that all my servants shall have lovers if they want them ! Do make the same resolve ! ”
68396	68406	68407	68407	he	149	“ I must be a little stricter than that , ”
68410	68413	68355	68355	Lucetta	214	“ Why ? ”
68414	68435	68475	68475	Donald	139	“ You are a — a thriving woman ; and I am a struggling hay - and - corn merchant . ”
68436	68444	68475	68475	Donald	139	“ I am a very ambitious woman . ”
68445	68473	68475	68475	Donald	139	“ Ah , well , I cannet explain . I do n't know how to talk to ladies , ambitious or no ; and that 's true , ”
68480	68494	68506	68506	she	2425	“ I try to be civil to a ' folk — no more ! ”
68495	68504	68574	68574	one	1127	“ I see you are as you say , ”
68562	68572	68574	68574	one	1127	“ Have you seen young Mr. Farfrae this morning ? ”
68576	68622	68632	68632	Farfrae	149	“ He promised to meet me here at the stroke of twelve ; but I 've gone athwart and about the fair half - a - dozen times , and never a sign of him : though he 's mostly a man to his word . ”
68623	68630	68642	68642	she	2425	“ I quite forgot the engagement , ”
68634	68640	68642	68642	she	2425	“ Now you must go , ”
68644	68649	68654	68654	he	149	“ must you not ? ”
68650	68653	68669	68669	she	2425	“ Yes , ”
68662	68668	68669	68669	she	2425	“ You had better go , ”
68672	68679	68685	68685	you	203	“ You will lose a customer . “
68691	68695	68744	68744	I	0	” exclaimed Farfrae . “
68709	68743	68749	68749	I	0	” He looked anxiously at the farmer who was seeking him and who just then ominously walked across to where Henchard was standing , and he looked into the room and at her . “
68755	68759	68794	68794	ma'am	618	” he said . “
68770	68771	68794	68794	ma'am	618	” “
68778	68779	68784	68784	I	0	” “
68796	68797	68784	68784	I	0	” “
68800	68804	68854	68854	I	0	” she said . “
68817	68818	68854	68854	I	0	” “
68834	68835	68854	68854	I	0	” “
68850	68851	68854	68854	I	0	” “
68863	68864	68854	68854	I	0	” “
68886	68887	68896	68896	I	0	” “
68906	68931	68896	68896	I	0	” Lucetta almost laughed — she would quite have laughed — but that there was a little emotion going in her at the time . “
68936	68940	68959	68960	the Scotchman	886	” she said . “
68948	68957	68959	68960	the Scotchman	886	“ I have never wished such things before , ”
68974	68985	68896	68896	I	0	“ It is only since coming here and seeing you ! ”
68986	69014	68959	68960	the Scotchman	886	“ If that 's the case , you had better not look at me any longer . Dear me , I feel I have quite demoralized you ! ”
69015	69045	68959	68960	the Scotchman	886	“ But look or look not , I will see you in my thoughts . Well , I 'll go — thank you for the pleasure of this visit . ”
69046	69052	69073	69073	he	886	“ Thank you for staying . ”
69053	69072	69073	69073	he	886	“ Maybe I 'll get into my market - mind when I 've been out a few minutes , ”
69076	69088	69092	69092	she	2433	“ But I do n't know — I do n't know ! ”
69096	69142	69151	69151	he	886	“ You may hear them speak of me in Casterbridge as time goes on . If they tell you I 'm a coquette , which some may , because of the incidents of my life , do n't believe it , for I am not . ”
69143	69150	69428	69428	she	2443	“ I swear I will not ! ”
69423	69427	69453	69454	the maid	4481	“ The Mayor , ”
69462	69478	69453	69454	the maid	4481	“ And he 's afraid he has n't much time to spare , he says . ”
69479	69500	69592	69592	Lucetta	214	“ Oh ! Then tell him that as I have a headache I wo n't detain him to - day . ”
69603	69625	70063	70063	Elizabeth	191	“ I 'm so glad you 've come . You 'll live with me a long time , wo n't you ? ”
70051	70061	70095	70095	Lucetta	214	“ I would n't think so hard about it , ”
70083	70093	70095	70095	Lucetta	214	“ But settling upon new clothes is so trying , ”
70097	70102	70095	70095	Lucetta	214	“ You are that person ”
70112	70120	70095	70095	Lucetta	214	“ or you are THAT totally different person ”
70128	70156	70448	70448	she	191	“ for the whole of the coming spring and one of the two , you do n't know which , may turn out to be very objectionable . ”
70436	70447	70462	70462	Elizabeth	191	“ Why , it is a sort of agricultural piano , ”
70451	70460	70462	70462	Elizabeth	191	“ It has something to do with corn , ”
70464	70474	70581	70581	Lucetta	214	“ I wonder who thought of introducing it here ? ”
70600	70614	70708	70708	somebody	4446	“ Let us go and look at the instrument , whatever it is . ”
70711	70719	70740	70742	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Good morning , Elizabeth - Jane . ”
70754	70768	70812	70812	she	203	“ This is the lady I live with , father — Miss Templeman . ”
70798	70811	70812	70812	she	203	“ I am happy to become acquainted with you , Mr. Henchard , ”
70815	70822	70831	70831	he	120	“ This is a curious machine . ”
70823	70826	70853	70853	Lucetta	214	“ Yes , ”
70845	70851	70867	70867	Henchard	120	“ Who brought it here ? ”
70855	70865	70867	70867	Henchard	120	“ Oh , do n't ask me , ma'am ! ”
70869	70906	70963	70963	she	203	“ The thing — why ' tis impossible it should act . ' Twas brought here by one of our machinists on the recommendation of a jumped - up jackanapes of a fellow who thinks — — ”
70968	70975	71131	71131	herself	214	“ You refused to see me ! ”
71135	71154	71186	71187	Miss Templeman	203	“ The ' Lass of Gowrie ' from inside of a seed - drill — what a phenomenon ! ”
71175	71185	71204	71204	she	203	“ We are looking at the wonderful new drill , ”
71190	71203	71223	71223	Farfrae	139	“ But practically it is a stupid thing — is it not ? ”
71215	71221	71223	71223	Farfrae	139	“ Stupid ? O no ! ”
71226	71273	71288	71290	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ It will revolutionize sowing heerabout ! No more sowers flinging their seed about broadcast , so that some falls by the wayside and some among thorns , and all that . Each grain will go straight to its intended place , and nowhere else whatever ! ”
71274	71286	71294	71294	herself	191	“ Then the romance of the sower is gone for good , ”
71306	71339	71351	71351	Donald	139	“ ' He that observeth the wind shall not sow , ' so the Preacher said ; but his words will not be to the point any more . How things change ! ”
71340	71350	71382	71382	he	1094	“ Ay ; ay .... It must be so ! ”
71365	71381	71412	71412	she	214	“ But the machines are already very common in the East and North of England , ”
71405	71411	71425	71425	he	1094	“ Is the machine yours ? ”
71417	71423	71442	71442	he	1094	“ O no , madam , ”
71449	71463	71498	71498	he	1094	“ No , no — I merely recommended that it should be got . ”
71522	71533	71559	71559	Lucetta	214	“ Well , do n't forsake the machine for us , ”
71576	71597	71821	71821	Lucetta	214	“ I had occasion to speak to Mr. Farfrae the other day , and so I knew him this morning . ”
71811	71819	71821	71821	Lucetta	214	“ Your father was distant with you , ”
71823	71826	71840	71840	she	214	“ Yes . ”
71843	71899	71916	71916	she	214	“ It is because he does not think I am respectable . I have tried to be so more than you can imagine , but in vain ! My mother 's separation from my father was unfortunate for me . You do n't know what it is to have shadows like that upon your life . ”
71905	71915	71916	71916	she	214	“ I do not — of that kind precisely , ”
71919	71936	71948	71949	the younger	2412	“ but you may feel a — sense of disgrace — shame — in other ways . ”
71937	71946	71958	71958	Lucetta	214	“ Have you ever had any such feeling ? ”
71952	71956	71958	71958	Lucetta	214	“ O no , ”
71961	71990	71916	71916	she	214	“ I was thinking of — what happens sometimes when women get themselves in strange positions in the eyes of the world from no fault of their own . ”
71991	72000	71958	71958	Lucetta	214	“ It must make them very unhappy afterwards . ”
72001	72015	72031	72031	Lucetta	214	“ It makes them anxious ; for might not other women despise them ? ”
72016	72030	72380	72380	Elizabeth	191	“ Not altogether despise them . Yet not quite like or respect them . ”
72371	72378	72388	72388	Lucetta	214	“ You 've seen Mr. Farfrae , ”
72383	72386	72397	72397	She	214	“ Yes , ”
72390	72396	72501	72501	she	191	“ How did you know ? ”
72484	72500	72510	72512	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ This person — a lady — once admired a man much — very much , ”
72505	72508	72510	72512	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Ah , ”
72514	72629	72501	72501	she	191	“ They were intimate — rather . He did not think so deeply of her as she did of him . But in an impulsive moment , purely out of reparation , he proposed to make her his wife . She agreed . But there was an unsuspected hitch in the proceedings ; though she had been so far compromised with him that she felt she could never belong to another man , as a pure matter of conscience , even if she should wish to . After that they were much apart , heard nothing of each other for a long time , and she felt her life quite closed up for her . ”
72630	72636	72510	72512	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Ah — poor girl ! ”
72637	72680	72510	72512	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ She suffered much on account of him ; though I should add that he could not altogether be blamed for what had happened . At last the obstacle which separated them was providentially removed ; and he came to marry her . ”
72681	72685	72501	72501	she	191	“ How delightful ! ”
72686	72721	72510	72512	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ But in the interval she — my poor friend — had seen a man , she liked better than him . Now comes the point : Could she in honour dismiss the first ? ”
72722	72734	72740	72740	Lucetta	214	“ A new man she liked better — that 's bad ! ”
72735	72738	72740	72740	Lucetta	214	“ Yes , ”
72756	72822	72831	72833	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ It is bad ! Though you must remember that she was forced into an equivocal position with the first man by an accident — that he was not so well educated or refined as the second , and that she had discovered some qualities in the first that rendered him less desirable as a husband than she had at first thought him to be . ”
72823	72829	72831	72833	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ I can not answer , ”
72836	72850	72867	72867	she	214	“ It is so difficult . It wants a Pope to settle that ! ”
72851	72858	72882	72882	Elizabeth	191	“ You prefer not to perhaps ? ”
72874	72880	72882	72882	Elizabeth	191	“ Yes , Miss Templeman , ”
72884	72891	72934	72934	she	214	“ I would rather not say . ”
72918	72933	72947	72947	Elizabeth	191	“ Bring me a looking - glass . How do I appear to people ? ”
72938	72945	72989	72989	she	214	“ Well — a little worn , ”
72976	72988	72989	72989	she	214	“ I wonder if I wear well , as times go ! ”
72995	73000	73003	73003	I	0	“ Yes — fairly . “
73006	73007	73012	73012	I	0	” “
73019	73020	73037	73037	you	191	” “
73048	73077	73037	73037	you	191	” There was something curious in the way in which Elizabeth , though the younger , had come to play the part of experienced sage in these discussions . “
73084	73089	73198	73198	she	2545	” she said judicially . “
73111	73197	73198	73198	she	2545	” Lucetta seemed to reflect on this as on an unalterable , impartial verdict . She told Elizabeth - Jane no more of the past attachment she had roughly adumbrated as the experiences of a third person ; and Elizabeth , who in spite of her philosophy was very tender - hearted , sighed that night in bed at the thought that her pretty , rich Lucetta did not treat her to the full confidence of names and dates in her confessions . For by the “
73199	73209	73458	73458	she	191	” of Lucetta 's story Elizabeth had not been beguiled .
73454	73457	73458	73458	she	191	“ Yes , ”
73474	73487	73773	73773	he	122	“ HE is the second man of that story she told me ! ”
73761	73772	73773	73773	he	122	“ Why , of course I have called , Lucetta , ”
73776	73885	73894	73894	she	2558	“ What does that nonsense mean ? You know I could n't have helped myself if I had wished — that is , if I had any kindness at all . I 've called to say that I am ready , as soon as custom will permit , to give you my name in return for your devotion and what you lost by it in thinking too little of yourself and too much of me ; to say that you can fix the day or month , with my full consent , whenever in your opinion it would be seemly : you know more of these things than I. ”
73886	73893	73894	73894	she	2558	“ It is full early yet , ”
73898	73989	74053	74053	he	2559	“ Yes , yes ; I suppose it is . But you know , Lucetta , I felt directly my poor ill - used Susan died , and when I could not bear the idea of marrying again , that after what had happened between us it was my duty not to let any unnecessary delay occur before putting things to rights . Still , I would n't call in a hurry , because — well , you can guess how this money you 've come into made me feel . ”
74034	74052	74064	74064	she	2563	“ Upon my life I did n't know such furniture as this could be bought in Casterbridge , ”
74056	74062	74053	74053	he	2559	“ Nor can it be , ”
74066	74094	74015	74015	He	2559	“ Nor will it till fifty years more of civilization have passed over the town . It took a waggon and four horses to get it here . ”
74095	74108	74053	74053	he	2559	“ H'm . It looks as if you were living on capital . ”
74109	74117	74053	74053	he	2559	“ O no , I am not . ”
74118	74142	74015	74015	He	2559	“ So much the better . But the fact is , your setting up like this makes my beaming towards you rather awkward . ”
74143	74146	74165	74165	he	2559	“ Why ? ”
74161	74164	74165	74165	he	2559	“ Well , ”
74169	74204	74240	74240	she	2563	“ there 's nobody in the world I would have wished to see enter into this wealth before you , Lucetta , and nobody , I am sure , who will become it more . ”
74227	74238	74259	74259	Henchard	122	“ I am greatly obliged to you for all that , ”
74275	74318	74333	74333	Lucetta	214	“ You may be obliged or not for't . Though the things I say may not have the polish of what you 've lately learnt to expect for the first time in your life , they are real , my lady Lucetta . ”
74319	74331	74346	74346	Henchard	122	“ That 's rather a rude way of speaking to me , ”
74339	74344	74346	74346	Henchard	122	“ Not at all ! ”
74349	74384	74393	74393	she	214	“ But there , there , I do n't wish to quarrel with ' ee . I come with an honest proposal for silencing your Jersey enemies , and you ought to be thankful . ”
74385	74392	74393	74393	she	214	“ How can you speak so ! ”
74399	74488	74496	74496	he	2565	“ Knowing that my only crime was the indulging in a foolish girl 's passion for you with too little regard for correctness , and that I was what I call innocent all the time they called me guilty , you ought not to be so cutting ! I suffered enough at that worrying time , when you wrote to tell me of your wife 's return and my consequent dismissal , and if I am a little independent now , surely the privilege is due to me ! ”
74489	74495	74496	74496	he	2565	“ Yes , it is , ”
74499	74552	74393	74393	she	214	“ But it is not by what is , in this life , but by what appears , that you are judged ; and I therefore think you ought to accept me — for your own good name 's sake . What is known in your native Jersey may get known here . ”
74553	74565	74496	74496	he	2565	“ How you keep on about Jersey ! I am English ! ”
74566	74581	74609	74609	she	214	“ Yes , yes . Well , what do you say to my proposal ? ”
74600	74608	74634	74634	She	214	“ For the present let things be , ”
74615	74633	74681	74681	he	2567	“ Treat me as an acquaintance , and I 'll treat you as one . Time will — ”
74668	74680	74836	74836	he	122	“ That 's the way the wind blows , is it ? ”
74818	74835	74906	74906	he	122	“ I should n't have thought it — I should n't have thought it of women ! ”
74894	74905	74939	74939	he	122	“ No , no ; such is not for me , ”
74926	74938	74939	74939	he	122	“ You came to live in Casterbridge entirely on my account , ”
74942	74959	74990	74990	she	214	“ Yet now you are here you wo n't have anything to say to my offer ! ”
74983	74989	74990	74990	she	214	“ I WILL love him ! ”
74994	75037	75305	75305	she	139	“ as for HIM — he 's hot - tempered and stern , and it would be madness to bind myself to him knowing that . I wo n't be a slave to the past — I 'll love where I choose ! ”
75314	75321	75596	75596	Henchard	122	“ meaner beauties of the night , ”
75590	75593	75611	75611	Henchard	122	“ Farfrae ! ”
75604	75609	75611	75611	Henchard	122	“ Do you remember , ”
75632	75652	75659	75659	Farfrae	139	“ do you remember my story of that second woman — who suffered for her thoughtless intimacy with me ? ”
75653	75657	75659	75659	Farfrae	139	“ I do , ”
75661	75678	75659	75659	Farfrae	139	“ Do you remember my telling ' ee how it all began and how it ended ? “
75681	75682	75711	75711	I	0	” “
75717	75718	75721	75721	ye	122	” “
75728	75733	76028	76030	Pleasant young fellow	2585	” said Farfrae heartily . “
75738	76027	76028	76030	Pleasant young fellow	2585	” said Henchard , and went on . That he had looked up from a letter to ask his questions completely shut out from Farfrae 's mind all vision of Lucetta as the culprit . Indeed , her present position was so different from that of the young woman of Henchard 's story as of itself to be sufficient to blind him absolutely to her identity . As for Henchard , he was reassured by Farfrae 's words and manner against a suspicion which had crossed his mind . They were not those of a conscious rival . Yet that there was rivalry by some one he was firmly persuaded . He could feel it in the air around Lucetta , see it in the turn of her pen . There was an antagonistic force in exercise , so that when he had tried to hang near her he seemed standing in a refluent current . That it was not innate caprice he was more and more certain . Her windows gleamed as if they did not want him ; her curtains seem to hang slily , as if they screened an ousting presence . To discover whose presence that was — whether really Farfrae 's after all , or another 's — he exerted himself to the utmost to see her again ; and at length succeeded . At the interview , when she offered him tea , he made it a point to launch a cautious inquiry if she knew Mr. Farfrae . O yes , she knew him , she declared ; she could not help knowing almost everybody in Casterbridge , living in such a gazebo over the centre and arena of the town . “
76032	76036	76028	76030	Pleasant young fellow	2585	” said Henchard . “
76039	76043	76044	76044	We	2586	” said Lucetta . “
76049	76085	76121	76121	he	2585	” said kind Elizabeth - Jane , to relieve her companion 's divined embarrassment . There was a knock at the door ; literally , three full knocks and a little one at the end . “
76103	76112	76121	76121	he	2585	” said the corn - merchant to himself . “
76123	76439	76121	76121	he	2585	” In a few seconds surely enough Donald walked in . Lucetta was full of little fidgets and flutters , which increased Henchard 's suspicions without affording any special proof of their correctness . He was well - nigh ferocious at the sense of the queer situation in which he stood towards this woman . One who had reproached him for deserting her when calumniated , who had urged claims upon his consideration on that account , who had lived waiting for him , who at the first decent opportunity had come to ask him to rectify , by making her his , the false position into which she had placed herself for his sake ; such she had been . And now he sat at her tea - table eager to gain her attention , and in his amatory rage feeling the other man present to be a villain , just as any young fool of a lover might feel . They sat stiffly side by side at the darkening table , like some Tuscan painting of the two disciples supping at Emmaus . Lucetta , forming the third and haloed figure , was opposite them ; Elizabeth - Jane , being out of the game , and out of the group , could observe all from afar , like the evangelist who had to write it down : that there were long spaces of taciturnity , when all exterior circumstances were subdued to the touch of spoons and china , the click of a heel on the pavement under the window , the passing of a wheelbarrow or cart , the whistling of the carter , the gush of water into householders ' buckets at the town - pump opposite , the exchange of greetings among their neighbours , and the rattle of the yokes by which they carried off their evening supply . “
76447	76499	76502	76502	I	0	” said Lucetta to Henchard and Farfrae equally , holding out between them a plateful of long slices . Henchard took a slice by one end and Donald by the other ; each feeling certain he was the man meant ; neither let go , and the slice came in two . “
76507	76539	76502	76502	I	0	” cried Lucetta , with a nervous titter . Farfrae tried to laugh ; but he was too much in love to see the incident in any but a tragic light . “
76548	76834	76502	76502	I	0	” said Elizabeth to herself . Henchard left the house with a ton of conjecture , though without a grain of proof , that the counterattraction was Farfrae ; and therefore he would not make up his mind . Yet to Elizabeth - Jane it was plain as the town - pump that Donald and Lucetta were incipient lovers . More than once , in spite of her care , Lucetta had been unable to restrain her glance from flitting across into Farfrae 's eyes like a bird to its nest . But Henchard was constructed upon too large a scale to discern such minutiae as these by an evening light , which to him were as the notes of an insect that lie above the compass of the human ear . But he was disturbed . And the sense of occult rivalry in suitorship was so much superadded to the palpable rivalry of their business lives . To the coarse materiality of that rivalry it added an inflaming soul . The thus vitalized antagonism took the form of action by Henchard sending for Jopp , the manager originally displaced by Farfrae 's arrival . Henchard had frequently met this man about the streets , observed that his clothing spoke of neediness , heard that he lived in Mixen Lane — a back slum of the town , the pis aller of Casterbridge domiciliation — itself almost a proof that a man had reached a stage when he would not stick at trifles . Jopp came after dark , by the gates of the storeyard , and felt his way through the hay and straw to the office where Henchard sat in solitude awaiting him . “
76843	76850	76852	76852	you	0	” said the corn - factor . “
76857	76858	76852	76852	you	0	” “
76869	76870	76874	76874	you	0	” “
76877	76888	76891	76891	you	0	” Jopp named his price , which was very moderate . “
76894	76895	76902	76902	sir	4588	” “
76904	77012	77018	77018	sir	4588	” said Jopp , who , standing hands - pocketed at the street corner till the sun had faded the shoulders of his coat to scarecrow green , had regularly watched Henchard in the market - place , measured him , and learnt him , by virtue of the power which the still man has in his stillness of knowing the busy one better than he knows himself . Jopp too , had had a convenient experience ; he was the only one in Casterbridge besides Henchard and the close - lipped Elizabeth who knew that Lucetta came truly from Jersey , and but proximately from Bath . “
77020	77024	77043	77043	ye	4588	” he said . “
77046	77047	77061	77061	you	4588	” “
77072	77090	77092	77092	you	4588	” That characters deteriorated in time of need possibly did not occur to Henchard . Jopp said , “
77094	77113	77170	77170	D'ye	2598	” and stood more firmly , in the consciousness that at last he officially belonged to that spot . “
77116	77129	77190	77190	I	0	” said Henchard , digging his strong eyes into Jopp 's face , “
77188	77189	77190	77190	I	0	” “
77196	77200	77204	77204	I	0	” said Jopp . “
77210	77214	77254	77254	I	0	” Henchard continued . “
77267	77268	77269	77269	I	0	” “
77277	77325	77326	77326	I	0	” said the new foreman . Jopp 's dislike of Farfrae as the man who had once ursurped his place , while it made him a willing tool , made him , at the same time , commercially as unsafe a colleague as Henchard could have chosen . “
77330	77334	77348	77348	He	886	” he added , “
77360	77361	77379	77379	We	2603	” “
77396	78260	77379	77379	We	2603	” They then entered into specific details of the process by which this would be accomplished , and parted at a late hour . Elizabeth - Jane heard by accident that Jopp had been engaged by her stepfather . She was so fully convinced that he was not the right man for the place that , at the risk of making Henchard angry , she expressed her apprehension to him when they met . But it was done to no purpose . Henchard shut up her argument with a sharp rebuff . The season 's weather seemed to favour their scheme . The time was in the years immediately before foreign competition had revolutionized the trade in grain ; when still , as from the earliest ages , the wheat quotations from month to month depended entirely upon the home harvest . A bad harvest , or the prospect of one , would double the price of corn in a few weeks ; and the promise of a good yield would lower it as rapidly . Prices were like the roads of the period , steep in gradient , reflecting in their phases the local conditions , without engineering , levellings , or averages . The farmer 's income was ruled by the wheat - crop within his own horizon , and the wheat - crop by the weather . Thus in person , he became a sort of flesh - barometer , with feelers always directed to the sky and wind around him . The local atmosphere was everything to him ; the atmospheres of other countries a matter of indifference . The people , too , who were not farmers , the rural multitude , saw in the god of the weather a more important personage than they do now . Indeed , the feeling of the peasantry in this matter was so intense as to be almost unrealizable in these equable days . Their impulse was well - nigh to prostrate themselves in lamentation before untimely rains and tempests , which came as the Alastor of those households whose crime it was to be poor . After midsummer they watched the weather - cocks as men waiting in antechambers watch the lackey . Sun elated them ; quiet rain sobered them ; weeks of watery tempest stupefied them . That aspect of the sky which they now regard as disagreeable they then beheld as maleficent . It was June , and the weather was very unfavourable . Casterbridge , being as it were the bell - board on which all the adjacent hamlets and villages sounded their notes , was decidedly dull . Instead of new articles in the shop - windows those that had been rejected in the foregoing summer were brought out again ; superseded reap - hooks , badly - shaped rakes , shop - worn leggings , and time - stiffened water - tights reappeared , furbished up as near to new as possible . Henchard , backed by Jopp , read a disastrous garnering , and resolved to base his strategy against Farfrae upon that reading . But before acting he wished — what so many have wished — that he could know for certain what was at present only strong probability . He was superstitious — as such head - strong natures often are — and he nourished in his mind an idea bearing on the matter ; an idea he shrank from disclosing even to Jopp . In a lonely hamlet a few miles from the town — so lonely that what are called lonely villages were teeming by comparison — there lived a man of curious repute as a forecaster or weather - prophet . The way to his house was crooked and miry — even difficult in the present unpropitious season . One evening when it was raining so heavily that ivy and laurel resounded like distant musketry , and an out - door man could be excused for shrouding himself to his ears and eyes , such a shrouded figure on foot might have been perceived travelling in the direction of the hazel - copse which dripped over the prophet 's cot . The turnpike - road became a lane , the lane a cart - track , the cart - track a bridle - path , the bridle - path a foot - way , the foot - way overgrown . The solitary walker slipped here and there , and stumbled over the natural springes formed by the brambles , till at length he reached the house , which , with its garden , was surrounded with a high , dense hedge . The cottage , comparatively a large one , had been built of mud by the occupier 's own hands , and thatched also by himself . Here he had always lived , and here it was assumed he would die . He existed on unseen supplies ; for it was an anomalous thing that while there was hardly a soul in the neighbourhood but affected to laugh at this man 's assertions , uttering the formula , “
78267	78296	77379	77379	We	2603	” with full assurance on the surface of their faces , very few of them were unbelievers in their secret hearts . Whenever they consulted him they did it “
78301	78309	77379	77379	We	2603	” When they paid him they said , “
78316	78318	77379	77379	We	2603	” or “
78321	78405	78421	78423	Mr. ” Fall	219	” as the case might be . He would have preferred more honesty in his clients , and less sham ridicule ; but fundamental belief consoled him for superficial irony . As stated , he was enabled to live ; people supported him with their backs turned . He was sometimes astonished that men could profess so little and believe so much at his house , when at church they professed so much and believed so little . Behind his back he was called “
78410	78420	78421	78423	Mr. ” Fall	219	” on account of his reputation ; to his face “
78422	78522	78524	78524	I	0	” Fall . The hedge of his garden formed an arch over the entrance , and a door was inserted as in a wall . Outside the door the tall traveller stopped , bandaged his face with a handkerchief as if he were suffering from toothache , and went up the path . The window shutters were not closed , and he could see the prophet within , preparing his supper . In answer to the knock Fall came to the door , candle in hand . The visitor stepped back a little from the light , and said , “
78530	78550	78524	78524	I	0	” in significant tones . The other 's invitation to come in was responded to by the country formula , “
78559	78604	78610	78610	you	2604	” after which the householder had no alternative but to come out . He placed the candle on the corner of the dresser , took his hat from a nail , and joined the stranger in the porch , shutting the door behind him . “
78619	78633	78637	78638	Mr. Henchard	120	” began the other , repressing his individuality as much as he could . “
78640	78647	78652	78652	you	2604	” said the weather - caster . “
78657	78665	78699	78699	ye	2604	” asked the visitor with a start . “
78702	78769	78784	78784	ye	2604	” He threw open the door and disclosed the supper - table , at which appeared a second chair , knife and fork , plate and mug , as he had declared . Henchard felt like Saul at his reception by Samuel ; he remained in silence for a few moments , then throwing off the disguise of frigidity which he had hitherto preserved he said , “
78789	78790	78784	78784	ye	2604	” “
78794	78795	78784	78784	ye	2604	” “
78800	78801	78784	78784	ye	2604	” “
78826	78827	78784	78784	ye	2604	” “
78832	78833	78784	78784	ye	2604	” “
78839	78840	78784	78784	ye	2604	” “
78845	78849	78892	78893	five farmers	2606	” said Henchard . “
78871	78886	78892	78893	five farmers	2606	“ I 've worked it out already , and you can know at once . ”
78910	78978	78892	78893	five farmers	2606	“ By the sun , moon , and stars , by the clouds , the winds , the trees , and grass , the candle - flame and swallows , the smell of the herbs ; likewise by the cats ' eyes , the ravens , the leeches , the spiders , and the dungmixen , the last fortnight in August will be — rain and tempest . ”
78979	78988	78892	78893	five farmers	2606	“ You are not certain , of course ? ”
78989	79028	79037	79037	Henchard	120	“ As one can be in a world where all 's unsure . ' Twill be more like living in Revelations this autumn than in England . Shall I sketch it out for ' ee in a scheme ? ”
79029	79035	79037	79037	Henchard	120	“ O no , no , ”
79039	79058	79075	79077	Wide - oh	222	“ I do n't altogether believe in forecasts , come to second thoughts on such . But I — ”
79059	79073	79075	79077	Wide - oh	222	“ You do n't — you do n't — ' tis quite understood , ”
79085	79115	79563	79563	he	120	“ You have given me a crown because you 've one too many . But wo n't you join me at supper , now ' tis waiting and all ? ”
79549	79562	79563	79563	he	120	“ Ho , no , no ! — nothing serious , man ! ”
79569	79628	79762	79762	his	120	“ These things always happen , do n't they ? I know it has been said that figures have touched me tight lately ; but is that anything rare ? The case is not so bad as folk make out perhaps . And dammy , a man must be a fool to mind the common hazards of trade ! ”
79772	79778	79805	79805	Henchard	120	“ A fine hot day , ”
79783	79803	79805	79805	Henchard	120	“ You can wipe and wipe , and say , ' A fine hot day , ' can ye ! ”
79820	79879	79916	79916	his	120	“ If it had n't been for your blasted advice it might have been a fine day enough ! Why did ye let me go on , hey ? — when a word of doubt from you or anybody would have made me think twice ! For you can never be sure of weather till ' tis past . ”
79880	79894	79914	79914	Henchard	120	“ My advice , sir , was to do what you thought best . ”
79895	79913	79962	79962	Jopp	137	“ A useful fellow ! And the sooner you help somebody else in that way the better ! ”
79943	79960	80131	80131	Henchard	120	“ You shall be sorry for this , sir ; sorry as a man can be ! ”
80117	80129	80322	80322	he	120	“ What if that curst conjuror should be right after all ! ”
80317	80321	80322	80322	he	120	“ I wonder , ”
80329	80377	80470	80470	Henchard	120	“ I wonder if it can be that somebody has been roasting a waxen image of me , or stirring an unholy brew to confound me ! I do n't believe in such power ; and yet — what if they should ha ' been doing it ! ”
80459	80468	80749	80751	Farfrae 's waggoner	2666	“ Why , he 'll soon be Mayor ! ”
80737	80747	80749	80751	Farfrae 's waggoner	2666	“ You must have done it a ' purpose ! ”
80753	80772	80800	80804	the wroth representative of Henchard	2667	“ You can hear my horses ' bells half - a - mile such a night as this ! ”
80773	80798	81046	81046	she	214	“ If ye'd been minding your business instead of zwailing along in such a gawk - hammer way , you would have zeed me ! ”
81036	81045	81046	81046	she	214	“ I saw it all , Mr. Henchard , ”
81049	81059	81082	81082	he	120	“ and your man was most in the wrong ! ”
81068	81080	81082	81082	he	120	“ Oh , I did n't notice you , Miss Templeman , ”
81084	81128	81140	81142	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ My man in the wrong ? Ah , to be sure ; to be sure ! But I beg your pardon notwithstanding . The other 's is the empty waggon , and he must have been most to blame for coming on . ”
81129	81138	81140	81142	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ No ; I saw it , too , ”
81144	81156	81167	81167	Henchard	191	“ And I can assure you he could n't help it . ”
81157	81165	81177	81177	Henchard	191	“ You ca n't trust THEIR senses ! ”
81171	81175	81177	81177	Henchard	191	“ Why not ? ”
81180	81234	81167	81167	Henchard	191	“ Why , you see , sir , all the women side with Farfrae — being a damn young dand — of the sort that he is — one that creeps into a maid 's heart like the giddying worm into a sheep 's brain — making crooked seem straight to their eyes ! ”
81235	81273	81177	81177	Henchard	191	“ But do you know who that lady is you talk about in such a fashion ? Do you know that I pay my attentions to her , and have for some time ? Just be careful ! ”
81274	81289	81167	81167	Henchard	191	“ Not I. I know nothing , sir , outside eight shillings a week . ”
81290	81321	81409	81412	the corn - merchant	1288	“ And that Mr. Farfrae is well aware of it ? He 's sharp in trade , but he would n't do anything so underhand as what you hint at . ”
81390	81407	81409	81412	the corn - merchant	1288	“ Just see that nobody drives against that hay and waggon to - night , Stubberd , ”
81414	81468	81384	81386	the old constable	2682	“ It must bide till the morning , for all hands are in the field still . And if any coach or road - waggon wants to come along , tell 'em they must go round by the back street , and be hanged to 'em .... Any case tomorrow up in Hall ? ”
81469	81480	81384	81386	the old constable	2682	“ Yes , sir . One in number , sir . ”
81481	81488	81409	81412	the corn - merchant	1288	“ Oh , what 's that ? ”
81489	81532	81384	81386	the old constable	2682	“ An old flagrant female , sir , swearing and committing a nuisance in a horrible profane manner against the church wall , sir , as if ' twere no more than a pot - house ! That 's all , sir . ”
81533	81548	81384	81386	the old constable	2682	“ Oh . The Mayor 's out o ' town , is n't he ? ”
81549	81555	81409	81412	the corn - merchant	1288	“ He is , sir . ”
81556	81584	81999	81999	Henchard	191	“ Very well , then I 'll be there . Do n't forget to keep an eye on that hay . Good night t ' ' ee . ”
82021	82023	82131	82131	Lucetta	214	“ stitches ”
82124	82130	82131	82131	Lucetta	214	“ You have my leave , ”
82136	82142	82150	82150	Farfrae	149	“ Speak what you like . ”
82143	82148	82170	82170	his	120	“ Well , then , ”
82174	82223	82232	82232	she	214	“ you are sure to be much sought after for your position , wealth , talents , and beauty . But will ye resist the temptation to be one of those ladies with lots of admirers — ay — and be content to have only a homely one ? ”
82224	82230	82232	82232	she	214	“ And he the speaker ? ”
82236	82245	82170	82170	his	120	“ Very well , sir , what next ? ”
82246	82263	82232	82232	she	214	“ Ah ! I 'm afraid that what I feel will make me forget my manners ! ”
82264	82283	82291	82291	she	214	“ Then I hope you 'll never have any , if you lack them only for that cause . ”
82294	82304	82334	82334	she	214	“ Are you sure you wo n't be jealous ? ”
82320	82333	82334	82334	she	214	“ You are convinced , Donald , that I love nobody else , ”
82338	82352	82305	82305	Farfrae	149	“ But I should wish to have my own way in some things . ”
82353	82364	82390	82390	Henchard	191	“ In everything ! What special thing did you mean ? ”
82365	82389	82632	82632	she	214	“ If I wished not to live always in Casterbridge , for instance , upon finding that I should not be happy here ? ”
82623	82631	82632	82632	she	214	“ How can you frighten me so ? ”
82640	82661	82613	82613	she	214	“ It is past ten o'clock , and you have no right to surprise me here at such a time . ”
82662	82697	82613	82613	she	214	“ I do n't know that I 've not the right . At any rate I have the excuse . Is it so necessary that I should stop to think of manners and customs ? ”
82698	82711	82779	82779	She	214	“ It is too late for propriety , and might injure me . ”
82712	82778	82807	82807	she	214	“ I called an hour ago , and you would not see me , and I thought you were in when I called now . It is you , Lucetta , who are doing wrong . It is not proper in ' ee to throw me over like this . I have a little matter to remind you of , which you seem to forget . ”
82789	82806	82843	82843	he	2722	“ I do n't want to hear it — I do n't want to hear it ! ”
82833	82841	82843	82843	he	2722	“ But you ought to hear it , ”
82845	82939	82995	82995	She	2723	“ It came to nothing ; and through you . Then why not leave me the freedom that I gained with such sorrow ! Had I found that you proposed to marry me for pure love I might have felt bound now . But I soon learnt that you had planned it out of mere charity — almost as an unpleasant duty — because I had nursed you , and compromised myself , and you thought you must repay me . After that I did not care for you so deeply as before . ”
82940	82952	82843	82843	he	2722	“ Why did you come here to find me , then ? ”
82953	82982	82995	82995	She	2723	“ I thought I ought to marry you for conscience ' sake , since you were free , even though I — did not like you so well . ”
82983	82994	83063	83063	she	2723	“ And why then do n't you think so now ? ”
83068	83091	83063	83063	she	2723	“ I was a poor girl then ; and now my circumstances have altered , so I am hardly the same person . ”
83092	83153	83168	83168	she	2723	“ That 's true . And it makes the case awkward for me . But I do n't want to touch your money . I am quite willing that every penny of your property shall remain to your personal use . Besides , that argument has nothing in it . The man you are thinking of is no better than I. ”
83154	83167	83187	83187	he	2726	“ If you were as good as he you would leave me ! ”
83177	83186	83187	83187	he	2726	“ You can not in honour refuse me , ”
83190	83223	83348	83348	he	2726	“ And unless you give me your promise this very night to be my wife , before a witness , I 'll reveal our intimacy — in common fairness to other men ! ”
83342	83347	83348	83348	he	2726	“ Elizabeth - Jane , ”
83355	83363	83348	83348	he	2726	“ I want you to hear this . ”
83369	83381	83394	83394	You	214	“ Will you , or will you not , marry me ? “
83392	83393	83394	83394	You	214	” “
83398	83399	83400	83400	I	0	” “
83403	83420	83430	83430	father	4491	” No sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting state . “
83441	83450	83462	83462	I	0	” asked Elizabeth , kneeling down by Lucetta . “
83477	83478	83462	83462	I	0	” “
83486	83491	83525	83525	Him	2734	” said Henchard drily . “
83510	83524	83539	83539	Nobody	298	” At this Lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start . “
83533	83538	83539	83539	Nobody	298	” she said wildly . “
83548	83553	83561	83561	my	0	” said Elizabeth firmly . “
83564	83568	83579	83579	She	203	” said Henchard . “
83586	83587	83607	83607	I	0	” “
83597	83606	83614	83614	she	203	” entreated Elizabeth , holding Lucetta 's hand . “
83617	83621	83625	83625	I	0	” said Henchard . “
83628	83644	83657	83657	I	0	” groaned Lucetta , her limbs hanging like fluid , from very misery and faintness . “
83655	83656	83657	83657	I	0	” “
83661	83683	83693	83693	You	120	” he said . And taking up his hat he went away . Elizabeth - Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta . “
83688	83692	83731	83731	you	120	” she said . “
83739	83740	83742	83742	you	120	” “
83748	83785	83815	83815	I	0	” Lucetta murmured with closed eyes , little thinking , however , so unsuspicious was she , that the secret of Elizabeth 's heart concerned the young man who had caused this damage to her own . “
83797	83814	83838	83838	I	0	” stammered Elizabeth , keeping in all signs of emotion till she was ready to burst . “
83850	83851	83838	83838	I	0	” “
83856	83860	83838	83838	I	0	” said Lucetta . “
83866	83866	84203	84203	he	5103	”
84192	84202	84231	84231	Stubberd	223	“ Well , and what has she been doing ? ”
84213	84229	84242	84244	the other magistrate	2757	“ She is charged , sir , with the offence of disorderly female and nuisance , ”
84233	84240	84242	84244	the other magistrate	2757	“ Where did she do that ? ”
84246	84273	84281	84281	Henchard	191	“ By the church , sir , of all the horrible places in the world ! — I caught her in the act , your worship . ”
84274	84279	84281	84281	Henchard	191	“ Stand back then , ”
84283	84295	84318	84319	the constable	2686	“ and let 's hear what you 've got to say . ”
84322	84356	84363	84363	Stubberd	223	“ Hearing a ' illegal noise I went down the street at twenty - five minutes past eleven P.M. on the night of the fifth instinct , Hannah Dominy . When I had — “
84365	84391	84363	84363	Stubberd	223	” said the clerk . The constable waited , with his eyes on the clerk 's pen , till the latter stopped scratching and said , “
84394	84398	84406	84406	I	0	” Stubberd continued : “
84418	84432	84437	84437	Stubberd	223	” He paused , watching the point of the clerk 's pen again . “
84439	84440	84486	84486	I	0	” “
84453	84485	84486	84486	I	0	” Still careful not to outrun the clerk 's penmanship Stubberd pulled up again ; for having got his evidence by heart it was immaterial to him whereabouts he broke off . “
84491	84498	84566	84566	myself	0	” spoke up the old woman , “
84517	84563	84584	84584	she	2762	” The magistrates consulted , and the second one said that the bench was of opinion that twelve feet nine inches from a man on his oath was admissible . Stubberd , with a suppressed gaze of victorious rectitude at the old woman , continued : “
84593	84594	84610	84610	She	2762	” “
84608	84609	84621	84621	she	2762	” “
84624	84625	84631	84631	she	2762	” “
84628	84629	84690	84692	the old woman	4510	” “
84681	84688	84690	84692	the old woman	4510	“ I object to that conversation ! ”
84694	84718	84787	84787	Henchard	191	“ I was not capable enough to hear what I said , and what is said out of my hearing is not evidence . ”
84792	84833	84787	84787	Henchard	191	“ Come — we do n't want to hear any more of them cust dees and bees ! Say the words out like a man , and do n't be so modest , Stubberd ; or else leave it alone ! ”
84839	84856	84861	84861	she	300	“ Now then , have you any questions to ask him , or anything to say ? ”
84857	84860	84874	84874	his	5576	“ Yes , ”
84877	84896	84923	84924	the clerk	5576	“ Twenty years ago or thereabout I was selling of furmity in a tent at Weydon Fair — — ”
84897	84921	84961	84962	the woman	300	“ ' Twenty years ago ' — well , that 's beginning at the beginning ; suppose you go back to the Creation ! ”
84945	84960	84961	84962	the woman	300	“ A man and a woman with a little child came into my tent , ”
84965	85098	85150	85152	the second magistrate	2755	“ They sat down and had a basin apiece . Ah , Lord 's my life ! I was of a more respectable station in the world then than I am now , being a land smuggler in a large way of business ; and I used to season my furmity with rum for them who asked for't . I did it for the man ; and then he had more and more ; till at last he quarrelled with his wife , and offered to sell her to the highest bidder . A sailor came in and bid five guineas , and paid the money , and led her away . And the man who sold his wife in that fashion is the man sitting there in the great big chair . ”
85136	85148	85150	85152	the second magistrate	2755	“ We do n't want to hear your life and adventures , ”
85161	85177	85150	85152	the second magistrate	2755	“ You 've been asked if you 've anything to say bearing on the case . ”
85178	85207	85217	85218	the clerk	5576	“ That bears on the case . It proves that he 's no better than I , and has no right to sit there in judgment upon me . ”
85208	85215	85217	85218	the clerk	5576	“ ' Tis a concocted story , ”
85220	85226	85239	85239	Henchard	191	“ So hold your tongue ! ”
85227	85234	85251	85251	he	2778	“ No — ' tis true . ”
85241	85250	85251	85251	he	2778	“ ' Tis as true as the light , ”
85255	85293	85403	85403	Lucetta	214	“ And upon my soul it does prove that I 'm no better than she ! And to keep out of any temptation to treat her hard for her revenge , I 'll leave her to you . ”
85386	85401	85413	85413	She	214	“ Why are there so many idlers round the Town Hall to - day ? ”
85427	85466	85766	85766	he	2798	“ Oh , please , ma'am , ' tis this larry about Mr. Henchard . A woman has proved that before he became a gentleman he sold his wife for five guineas in a booth at a fair . ”
85759	85765	85779	85780	his stepdaughter	2495	“ Is she come now ? ”
85769	85777	85755	85755	he	2798	“ Yes . She returned this morning , ”
85782	85812	85933	85933	he	2798	“ But she is not indoors . She has gone for a walk along the turnpike - road to Port - Bredy . She will be home by dusk . ”
85940	85944	86098	86098	She	214	“ for Sunday , ”
86103	86106	86183	86183	she	191	“ Donald ! ”
86171	86182	86453	86453	Lucetta	214	“ I suddenly thought I would come and meet you , ”
86442	86452	86809	86809	she	191	“ A bull passing down street from the sale . ”
86801	86808	87167	87167	she	214	“ We must climb up there , ”
87159	87166	87185	87185	he	291	“ You — have saved me ! ”
87177	87184	87185	87185	he	291	“ I have returned your kindness , ”
87189	87195	87208	87208	she	214	“ You once saved me . ”
87196	87207	87208	87208	she	214	“ How — comes it to be you — you ? ”
87216	87258	87304	87304	Henchard	191	“ I came out here to look for you . I have been wanting to tell you something these two or three days ; but you have been away , and I could not . Perhaps you can not talk now ? ”
87259	87268	87276	87278	the missing one	2865	“ Oh — no ! Where is Elizabeth ? ”
87269	87274	87362	87364	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Here am I ! ”
87354	87360	87385	87385	She	191	“ I 'll run back , ”
87366	87384	87613	87613	he	2872	“ I do n't mind it at all , as I am not tired as you are . ”
87600	87612	87613	87613	he	2872	“ She has gone on with Mr. Henchard , you say ? ”
87618	87635	87647	87649	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Yes . He is taking her home . They are almost there by this time . ”
87636	87646	87647	87649	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ And you are sure she can get home ? ”
87654	87660	87665	87665	Farfrae	139	“ Your stepfather saved her ? ”
87661	87664	87885	87885	he	2872	“ Entirely . ”
87876	87884	87910	87910	she	993	“ When will everything be sent up ? ”
87898	87908	87910	87910	she	993	“ I am afraid not before eight , sir , ”
87912	87936	87950	87950	Farfrae	139	“ You see we was n't aware till this morning that you were going to move , or we could have been forwarder . ”
87937	87948	87950	87950	Farfrae	139	“ A — well , never mind , never mind ! ”
87953	87985	88065	88065	he	1288	“ Eight o'clock will do well enough if it be not later . Now , do n't ye be standing here talking , or it will be twelve , I doubt . ”
88044	88064	88065	88065	he	1288	“ Dear Lucetta , I have been very , very anxious to see you these two or three days , ”
88068	88171	88188	88188	Lucetta	214	“ ever since I saw you last ! I have thought over the way I got your promise that night . You said to me , ' If I were a man I should not insist . ' That cut me deep . I felt that there was some truth in it . I do n't want to make you wretched ; and to marry me just now would do that as nothing else could — it is but too plain . Therefore I agree to an indefinite engagement — to put off all thought of marriage for a year or two . ”
88172	88186	88188	88188	Lucetta	214	“ But — but — can I do nothing of a different kind ? ”
88190	88240	88265	88265	he	2896	“ I am full of gratitude to you — you have saved my life . And your care of me is like coals of fire on my head ! I am a monied person now . Surely I can do something in return for your goodness — something practical ? ”
88253	88264	88265	88265	he	2896	“ There is one thing you might do , Lucetta , ”
88268	88276	88286	88286	she	214	“ But not exactly of that kind . ”
88277	88285	88286	88286	she	214	“ Then of what kind is it ? ”
88292	88341	88343	88343	you	2896	“ I must tell you a secret to ask it . — You may have heard that I have been unlucky this year ? I did what I have never done before — speculated rashly ; and I lost . That 's just put me in a strait . “
88352	88353	88343	88343	you	2896	” “
88358	88366	88621	88621	your	214	” said Henchard , almost in anger . “
88624	88633	88621	88621	your	214	” It being now what the people called the “
88636	88667	88621	88621	your	214	” of the day , that is , the quarter - hour just before dusk , he did not at first observe the result of his own words upon her . “
88674	88690	88711	88711	you	214	” she began , and the dryness of her lips was represented in her voice . “
88699	88708	88736	88736	he	2900	” he said , with a deep reproach . “
88743	88744	88756	88756	I	0	” “
88761	88769	88770	88770	You	214	” she said , with rising distress . “
88774	88779	88800	88800	I	0	” he burst out . “
88798	88799	88800	88800	I	0	” “
88804	88809	88813	88813	I	0	” she insisted desperately . “
88831	88832	88842	88842	Witness	2908	” “
88840	88841	88842	88842	Witness	2908	” “
88847	88864	88837	88838	a witness	5565	“ If I must tell you — — . Do n't , do n't upbraid me ! ”
88865	88875	88842	88842	Witness	2908	“ Well ! Let 's hear what you mean ? ”
88876	88886	88842	88842	Witness	2908	“ Witness of my marriage — Mr. Grower was ! ”
88887	88890	88837	88838	a witness	5565	“ Marriage ? ”
88891	88944	88980	88980	Henchard	120	“ Yes . With Mr. Farfrae . O Michael ! I am already his wife . We were married this week at Port - Bredy . There were reasons against our doing it here . Mr. Grower was a witness because he happened to be at Port - Bredy at the time . ”
88974	88978	88980	88980	Henchard	120	“ Married him ? ”
88984	88999	89007	89007	she	2909	“ My good — what , married him whilst — bound to marry me ? ”
89000	89006	89018	89018	her	2909	“ It was like this , ”
89021	89187	89251	89251	he	2910	“ do n't — do n't be cruel ! I loved him so much , and I thought you might tell him of the past — and that grieved me ! And then , when I had promised you , I learnt of the rumour that you had — sold your first wife at a fair like a horse or cow ! How could I keep my promise after hearing that ? I could not risk myself in your hands ; it would have been letting myself down to take your name after such a scandal . But I knew I should lose Donald if I did not secure him at once — for you would carry out your threat of telling him of our former acquaintance , as long as there was a chance of keeping me for yourself by doing so . But you will not do so now , will you , Michael ? for it is too late to separate us . ”
89233	89249	89251	89251	he	2910	“ Then this racket they are making is on account of it , I suppose ? ”
89253	89298	89018	89018	her	2909	“ Yes — I think he has told them , or else Mr. Grower has .... May I leave you now ? My — he was detained at Port - Bredy to - day , and sent me on a few hours before him . ”
89299	89313	89251	89251	he	2910	“ Then it is HIS WIFE 'S life I have saved this afternoon . ”
89314	89327	89344	89344	Henchard	120	“ Yes — and he will be for ever grateful to you . ”
89328	89341	89344	89344	Henchard	120	“ I am much obliged to him .... O you false woman ! ”
89346	89351	89251	89251	he	2910	“ You promised me ! ”
89352	89373	89344	89344	Henchard	120	“ Yes , yes ! But it was under compulsion , and I did not know all your past — — ”
89374	89411	89344	89344	Henchard	120	“ And now I 've a mind to punish you as you deserve ! One word to this bran - new husband of how you courted me , and your precious happiness is blown to atoms ! ”
89412	89422	89251	89251	he	2910	“ Michael — pity me , and be generous ! ”
89423	89439	89344	89344	Henchard	120	“ You do n't deserve pity ! You did ; but you do n't now . ”
89440	89451	89480	89480	She	2912	“ I 'll help you to pay off your debt . ”
89452	89479	89851	89851	she	214	“ A pensioner of Farfrae 's wife — not I ! Do n't stay with me longer — I shall say something worse . Go home ! ”
89834	89850	89851	89851	she	214	“ There is one thing I have not done ; and yet it is important , ”
89867	89884	89894	89894	he	387	“ That is , broken the news of our marriage to my dear Elizabeth - Jane . ”
89885	89893	89894	89894	he	387	“ Ah , and you have not ? ”
89898	89943	89851	89851	she	214	“ I gave her a lift from the barn homewards ; but I did not tell her either ; for I thought she might have heard of it in the town , and was keeping back her congratulations from shyness , and all that . ”
89944	89992	89894	89894	he	387	“ She can hardly have heard of it . But I 'll find out ; I 'll go to her now . And , Donald , you do n't mind her living on with me just the same as before ? She is so quiet and unassuming . ”
89993	90002	90003	90003	Farfrae	139	“ O no , indeed I do n't , ”
90013	90023	90030	90030	Lucetta	214	“ But I wonder if she would care to ? ”
90024	90028	90030	90030	Lucetta	214	“ O yes ! ”
90033	90053	90095	90095	he	2935	“ I am sure she would like to . Besides , poor thing , she has no other home . ”
90083	90094	90095	90095	he	2935	“ Arrange as you like with her by all means , ”
90098	90114	90126	90126	Lucetta	214	“ It is I who have come to your house , not you to mine . ”
90115	90124	90183	90183	she	214	“ I 'll run and speak to her , ”
90170	90182	90183	90183	she	214	“ I did not come down to you , Miss Templeman , ”
90187	90242	90243	90243	Lucetta	214	“ I was coming to ask if you had quite recovered from your fright , but I found you had a visitor . What are the bells ringing for , I wonder ? And the band , too , is playing . Somebody must be married ; or else they are practising for Christmas . ”
90247	90250	90273	90273	she	214	“ Yes , ”
90264	90272	90273	90273	she	214	“ What a lonely creature you are , ”
90277	90336	90363	90363	Lucetta	214	“ never knowing what 's going on , or what people are talking about everywhere with keen interest . You should get out , and gossip about as other women do , and then you would n't be obliged to ask me a question of that kind . Well , now , I have something to tell you . ”
90351	90361	90410	90410	She	214	“ I must go rather a long way back , ”
90384	90409	90442	90442	Elizabeth	191	“ You remember that trying case of conscience I told you of some time ago — about the first lover and the second lover ? ”
90428	90440	90442	90442	Elizabeth	191	“ O yes — I remember the story of YOUR FRIEND , ”
90460	90520	90534	90534	Lucetta	214	“ The two lovers — the old one and the new : how she wanted to marry the second , but felt she ought to marry the first ; so that she neglected the better course to follow the evil , like the poet Ovid I 've just been construing : ' Video meliora proboque , deteriora sequor . ' ”
90521	90532	90553	90553	Elizabeth	191	“ O no ; she did n't follow evil exactly ! ”
90537	90550	90553	90553	Elizabeth	191	“ But you said that she — or as I may say you ”
90559	90571	90584	90584	she	214	“ were in honour and conscience bound to marry the first ? ”
90588	90602	90584	90584	she	214	“ You will never breathe this , will you , Elizabeth - Jane ? ”
90603	90612	90750	90752	the other woman	2948	“ Certainly not , if you say not . “
90754	90755	90757	90757	you	191	” “
90764	90779	90757	90757	you	191	” said the younger with quiet surmise . She had divined Man Number One . “
90789	90790	90845	90845	He	432	” “
90836	90844	90852	90852	I	0	” Lucetta 's countenance lost its sparkle . “
90859	90863	90877	90877	I	0	” she pleaded . “
90881	90882	90893	90893	You	191	” “
90900	90901	90912	90912	I	0	” “
90910	90911	90912	90912	I	0	” “
90916	90922	90937	90937	I	0	” interrupted her companion hardily . “
90947	91008	91039	91039	I	0	” Any suspicion of impropriety was to Elizabeth - Jane like a red rag to a bull . Her craving for correctness of procedure was , indeed , almost vicious . Owing to her early troubles with regard to her mother a semblance of irregularity had terrors for her which those whose names are safeguarded from suspicion know nothing of . “
91023	91038	91039	91039	I	0	” she went on with a quivering lip in whose movement two passions shared . “
91045	91050	91039	91039	I	0	” said Lucetta passionately . “
91060	91087	91090	91090	you	0	” Lucetta covered her eyes with her right hand , as if she could plead no more , holding out her left to Elizabeth - Jane . “
91095	91112	91185	91185	You	0	” cried the latter , jumping up with pleasure after a glance at Lucetta 's fingers . “
91203	91204	91185	91185	You	0	” “
91212	91217	91277	91277	You	0	” cried Lucetta distressfully . “
91275	91276	91282	91283	Mr. Farfrae	149	” “
91285	91302	91282	91283	Mr. Farfrae	149	” cried Elizabeth - Jane , in Nathan tones Lucetta bowed . She had recovered herself . “
91311	91315	91341	91341	I	0	” she said . “
91352	91353	91379	91379	You	0	” “
91361	91378	91382	91382	I	0	” the girl quickly replied , corking up the turmoil of her feeling with grand control . “
91391	91791	92471	92471	he	120	” Lucetta departed to join Donald below , a vague uneasiness floating over her joy at seeing him quite at home there . Not on account of her friend Elizabeth did she feel it : for of the bearings of Elizabeth - Jane 's emotions she had not the least suspicion ; but on Henchard 's alone . Now the instant decision of Susan Henchard 's daughter was to dwell in that house no more . Apart from her estimate of the propriety of Lucetta 's conduct , Farfrae had been so nearly her avowed lover that she felt she could not abide there . It was still early in the evening when she hastily put on her things and went out . In a few minutes , knowing the ground , she had found a suitable lodging , and arranged to enter it that night . Returning and entering noiselessly she took off her pretty dress and arrayed herself in a plain one , packing up the other to keep as her best ; for she would have to be very economical now . She wrote a note to leave for Lucetta , who was closely shut up in the drawing - room with Farfrae ; and then Elizabeth - Jane called a man with a wheel - barrow ; and seeing her boxes put into it she trotted off down the street to her rooms . They were in the street in which Henchard lived , and almost opposite his door . Here she sat down and considered the means of subsistence . The little annual sum settled on her by her stepfather would keep body and soul together . A wonderful skill in netting of all sorts — acquired in childhood by making seines in Newson 's home — might serve her in good stead ; and her studies , which were pursued unremittingly , might serve her in still better . By this time the marriage that had taken place was known throughout Casterbridge ; had been discussed noisily on kerbstones , confidentially behind counters , and jovially at the Three Mariners . Whether Farfrae would sell his business and set up for a gentleman on his wife 's money , or whether he would show independence enough to stick to his trade in spite of his brilliant alliance , was a great point of interest .
92467	92470	92471	92471	he	120	“ Gentlemen , ”
92474	92528	92619	92619	he	120	“ over and above the assets that we 've been talking about , and that appear on the balance - sheet , there be these . It all belongs to ye , as much as everything else I 've got , and I do n't wish to keep it from you , not I. ”
92604	92618	92619	92619	he	120	“ There , now you have all I 've got in the world , ”
92622	92633	92674	92674	he	185	“ And I wish for your sakes ' twas more . ”
92666	92673	92674	92674	he	185	“ No , no , Henchard , ”
92678	92706	92722	92722	Grower	229	“ We do n't want that . ' Tis honourable in ye ; but keep it . What do you say , neighbours — do ye agree ? ”
92707	92720	92738	92741	another in the background	2996	“ Ay , sure : we do n't wish it at all , ”
92727	92736	92763	92765	the senior Commissioner	2999	“ Let him keep it , of course , ”
92758	92761	92763	92765	the senior Commissioner	2999	“ Well , ”
92770	92861	92923	92923	he	3000	“ though the case is a desperate one , I am bound to admit that I have never met a debtor who behaved more fairly . I 've proved the balance - sheet to be as honestly made out as it could possibly be ; we have had no trouble ; there have been no evasions and no concealments . The rashness of dealing which led to this unhappy situation is obvious enough ; but as far as I can see every attempt has been made to avoid wronging anybody . ”
92915	92922	92923	92923	he	3000	“ ' Tisn't mine by rights , ”

We work harder , but we bain't made afeard now . It was fear made my few poor hairs so thin ! No busting out , no slamming of doors , no meddling with yer eternal soul and all that ; and though ' tis a shilling a week less I 'm the richer man ; for what 's all the world if yer mind is always in a larry , Miss Henchet ? ”

94700	94714	94723	94723	Henchard	191	“ He and she are gone into their new house to - day , ”
94718	94721	94723	94723	Henchard	191	“ Oh , ”
94726	94732	94749	94749	Henchard	191	“ Which house is that ? ”
94733	94738	94749	94749	Henchard	191	“ Your old one . ”
94739	94745	94749	94749	Henchard	191	“ Gone into my house ? ”
94752	94762	94798	94798	he	3100	“ MY house of all others in the town ! ”
94763	94792	94862	94862	Jopp	137	“ Well , as somebody was sure to live there , and you could n't , it can do ' ee no harm that he 's the man . ”
94865	94912	94862	94862	Jopp	137	“ And you heard of that fellow who bought all the best furniture at your sale ? He was bidding for no other than Farfrae all the while ! It has never been moved out of the house , as he 'd already got the lease . ”

94929	94945	95053	95053	Farfrae	149	“ There 's no saying he wo n't , if you be willing to sell . ”
95041	95045	95102	95102	he	149	“ Mr. Henchard ? ”
95088	95101	95102	95102	he	149	“ I have heard that you think of emigrating , Mr. Henchard ? ”
95105	95118	95119	95119	Henchard	120	“ Is it true ? I have a real reason for asking . ”
95131	95235	95256	95256	Farfrae	149	“ Yes ; it is true . I am going where you were going to a few years ago , when I prevented you and got you to bide here . ' Tis turn and turn about , is n't it ! Do ye mind how we stood like this in the Chalk Walk when I persuaded ' ee to stay ? You then stood without a chattel to your name , and I was the master of the house in Corn Street . But now I stand without a stick or a rag , and the master of that house is you . ”
95236	95254	95267	95267	Henchard	120	“ Yes , yes ; that 's so ! It 's the way o ' the warrld , ”
95258	95265	95267	95267	Henchard	120	“ Ha , ha , true ! ”
95277	95295	95313	95313	Farfrae	149	“ Up and down ! I 'm used to it . What 's the odds after all ! ”
95296	95311	95313	95313	Farfrae	149	“ Now listen to me , if it 's no taking up your time , ”
95315	95331	95344	95344	Henchard	120	“ just as I listened to you . Do n't go . Stay at home . ”
95332	95342	95344	95344	Henchard	120	“ But I can do nothing else , man ! ”
95347	95398	95451	95451	Henchard	120	“ The little money I have will just keep body and soul together for a few weeks , and no more . I have not felt inclined to go back to journey - work yet ; but I ca n't stay doing nothing , and my best chance is elsewhere . ”
95399	95450	95485	95485	he	120	“ No ; but what I propose is this — if ye will listen . Come and live in your old house . We can spare some rooms very well — I am sure my wife would not mind it at all — until there 's an opening for ye . ”
95479	95484	95485	95485	he	120	“ No , no , ”
95489	95494	95506	95506	Farfrae	149	“ we should quarrel . ”
95495	95504	95506	95506	Farfrae	149	“ You should hae a part to yourself , ”
95508	95534	95549	95549	he	120	“ and nobody to interfere wi ' you . It will be a deal healthier than down there by the river where you live now . ”
95539	95548	95549	95549	he	120	“ You do n't know what you ask , ”
95552	95565	95601	95601	Farfrae	149	“ However , I can do no less than thank ' ee . ”
95589	95599	95601	95601	Farfrae	149	“ Will you come in and have some supper ? ”
95619	95624	95648	95648	I	0	“ No , no . ”
95625	95646	95648	95648	I	0	“ By - the - bye , I had nearly forgot . I bought a good deal of your furniture . “
95652	95653	95754	95755	the creditors	2988	” “
95735	95736	95754	95755	the creditors	2988	” “
95746	95750	95752	95752	you	3124	” said Henchard . “
95759	95760	95787	95787	I	0	” “
95779	95786	95787	95787	I	0	” Henchard was a little moved . “
95797	96050	95787	95787	I	0	” he said , in tones which showed the disquietude that the night shades hid in his face . He shook Farfrae abruptly by the hand , and hastened away as if unwilling to betray himself further . Farfrae saw him turn through the thoroughfare into Bull Stake and vanish down towards the Priory Mill . Meanwhile Elizabeth - Jane , in an upper room no larger than the Prophet 's chamber , and with the silk attire of her palmy days packed away in a box , was netting with great industry between the hours which she devoted to studying such books as she could get hold of . Her lodgings being nearly opposite her stepfather 's former residence , now Farfrae 's , she could see Donald and Lucetta speeding in and out of their door with all the bounding enthusiasm of their situation . She avoided looking that way as much as possible , but it was hardly in human nature to keep the eyes averted when the door slammed . While living on thus quietly she heard the news that Henchard had caught cold and was confined to his room — possibly a result of standing about the meads in damp weather . She went off to his house at once . This time she was determined not to be denied admittance , and made her way upstairs . He was sitting up in the bed with a greatcoat round him , and at first resented her intrusion . “
96057	96061	96062	96062	I	0	” he said . “
96071	96072	96075	96075	father	4491	” “
96077	96078	96079	96079	I	0	” “
96088	96452	96463	96463	I	0	” he repeated . However , the ice was broken , and she remained . She made the room more comfortable , gave directions to the people below , and by the time she went away had reconciled her stepfather to her visiting him . The effect , either of her ministrations or of her mere presence , was a rapid recovery . He soon was well enough to go out ; and now things seemed to wear a new colour in his eyes . He no longer thought of emigration , and thought more of Elizabeth . The having nothing to do made him more dreary than any other circumstance ; and one day , with better views of Farfrae than he had held for some time , and a sense that honest work was not a thing to be ashamed of , he stoically went down to Farfrae 's yard and asked to be taken on as a journeyman hay - trusser . He was engaged at once . This hiring of Henchard was done through a foreman , Farfrae feeling that it was undesirable to come personally in contact with the ex - corn - factor more than was absolutely necessary . While anxious to help him he was well aware by this time of his uncertain temper , and thought reserved relations best . For the same reason his orders to Henchard to proceed to this and that country farm trussing in the usual way were always given through a third person . For a time these arrangements worked well , it being the custom to truss in the respective stack - yards , before bringing it away , the hay bought at the different farms about the neighbourhood ; so that Henchard was often absent at such places the whole week long . When this was all done , and Henchard had become in a measure broken in , he came to work daily on the home premises like the rest . And thus the once flourishing merchant and Mayor and what not stood as a day - labourer in the barns and granaries he formerly had owned . “
96465	96474	96660	96660	she	3133	” he would say in his defiant way ; “
96484	96657	96664	96664	she	3133	” But he looked a far different journeyman from the one he had been in his earlier days . Then he had worn clean , suitable clothes , light and cheerful in hue ; leggings yellow as marigolds , corduroys immaculate as new flax , and a neckerchief like a flower - garden . Now he wore the remains of an old blue cloth suit of his gentlemanly times , a rusty silk hat , and a once black satin stock , soiled and shabby . Clad thus he went to and fro , still comparatively an active man — for he was not much over forty — and saw with the other men in the yard Donald Farfrae going in and out the green door that led to the garden , and the big house , and Lucetta . At the beginning of the winter it was rumoured about Casterbridge that Mr. Farfrae , already in the Town Council , was to be proposed for Mayor in a year or two . “
96671	96735	96744	96744	Mayor	1548	” said Henchard to himself when he heard of this one day on his way to Farfrae 's hay - barn . He thought it over as he wimbled his bonds , and the piece of news acted as a reviviscent breath to that old view of his — of Donald Farfrae as his triumphant rival who rode rough - shod over him . “
96748	96761	96821	96821	his	3135	” he murmured with a corner - drawn smile on his mouth . “
96824	96996	96821	96821	his	3135	” He repeated these things a hundred times a day . During the whole period of his acquaintance with Lucetta he had never wished to claim her as his own so desperately as he now regretted her loss . It was no mercenary hankering after her fortune that moved him , though that fortune had been the means of making her so much the more desired by giving her the air of independence and sauciness which attracts men of his composition . It had given her servants , house , and fine clothing — a setting that invested Lucetta with a startling novelty in the eyes of him who had known her in her narrow days . He accordingly lapsed into moodiness , and at every allusion to the possibility of Farfrae 's near election to the municipal chair his former hatred of the Scotchman returned . Concurrently with this he underwent a moral change . It resulted in his significantly saying every now and then , in tones of recklessness , “
97002	97004	96821	96821	his	3135	” — “
97010	97022	96821	96821	his	3135	” and so forth , lessening his figures day by day . “
97031	97046	96821	96821	his	3135	” asked Solomon Longways as he worked beside Henchard in the granary weighing oats . “
97059	97060	96821	96821	his	3135	” “
97064	97065	97098	97098	God	126	” “
97100	97151	97152	97153	Michael Henchard	120	” Elizabeth - Jane sat at her window one Sunday , and while there she heard in the street below a conversation which introduced Henchard 's name . She was wondering what was the matter , when a third person who was passing by asked the question in her mind . “
97167	97182	97668	97668	they	3169	” Elizabeth - Jane jumped up , put on her things , and went out .
97675	97688	97719	97719	he	120	“ How be ye , Mr. Henchard ? Quite a stranger here . ”
97715	97718	97719	97719	he	120	“ Yes , ”
97724	97792	97801	97803	the first fiddle	3170	“ that 's true . I 've been down in spirit for weeks ; some of ye know the cause . I am better now , but not quite serene . I want you fellows of the choir to strike up a tune ; and what with that and this brew of Stannidge 's , I am in hopes of getting altogether out of my minor key . ”
97793	97799	97801	97803	the first fiddle	3170	“ With all my heart , ”
97805	97838	97853	97853	Henchard	120	“ We 've let back our strings , that 's true , but we can soon pull 'em up again . Sound A , neighbours , and give the man a stave . ”
97839	97851	97853	97853	Henchard	120	“ I do n't care a curse what the words be , ”
97855	97892	97927	97931	the leader of the band	3171	“ Hymns , ballets , or rantipole rubbish ; the Rogue 's March or the cherubim 's warble — ' tis all the same to me if ' tis good harmony , and well put out . ”
97893	97925	97927	97931	the leader of the band	3171	“ Well — heh , heh — it may be we can do that , and not a man among us that have sat in the gallery less than twenty year , ”
97933	97959	97974	97974	Henchard	120	“ As ' tis Sunday , neighbours , suppose we raise the Fourth Psa'am , to Samuel Wakely 's tune , as improved by me ? ”
97960	97972	98025	98025	He	120	“ Hang Samuel Wakely 's tune , as improved by thee ! ”
97976	98024	98139	98139	he	120	“ Chuck across one of your psalters — old Wiltshire is the only tune worth singing — the psalm - tune that would make my blood ebb and flow like the sea when I was a steady chap . I 'll find some words to fit en . ”
98134	98138	98139	98139	he	120	“ Now then , ”
98142	98168	98174	98174	I	0	“ Psalm the Hundred - and - Ninth , to the tune of Wiltshire : verses ten to fifteen . I gi'e ye the words : “
98179	98185	98265	98265	me	0	” said the leader hastily ; “
98267	98268	98275	98275	I	0	” “
98295	98299	98275	98275	I	0	” roared Henchard . “
98322	98344	98432	98432	ye	3185	” He slipped off the table , seized the poker , and going to the door placed his back against it . “
98363	98364	98396	98396	we	3188	” “
98405	98430	98435	98435	ye	3185	” said one of the terrified choir , looking round upon the rest . So the instruments were tuned and the comminatory verses sung . “
98437	98463	98487	98487	He	238	” said Henchard in a softened voice , his eyes growing downcast , and his manner that of a man much moved by the strains . “
98470	98486	98613	98619	the man we 've been singing about	3189	” he went on in low tones , shaking his head without raising his eyes . “
98568	98610	98613	98619	the man we 've been singing about	3189	” While they paused , Lucetta and Farfrae passed again , this time homeward , it being their custom to take , like others , a short walk out on the highway and back , between church and tea - time . “
98621	98637	98651	98652	the man	291	” said Henchard . The players and singers turned their heads and saw his meaning . “
98641	98648	98651	98652	the man	291	” said the bass - player . “
98654	98659	98662	98662	I	0	” repeated Henchard doggedly . “
98666	98675	98703	98703	me	0	” said the performer on the clarionet solemnly , “
98705	98706	98703	98703	me	0	” “
98711	98717	98785	98785	he	291	” said the first singer . “
98756	98757	98763	98763	you	3194	” “
98768	98773	98805	98805	I	0	” said Henchard triumphantly . “
98809	98965	99031	99031	I	0	” He laid the poker across his knee , bent it as if it were a twig , flung it down , and came away from the door . It was at this time that Elizabeth - Jane , having heard where her stepfather was , entered the room with a pale and agonized countenance . The choir and the rest of the company moved off , in accordance with their half - pint regulation . Elizabeth - Jane went up to Henchard , and entreated him to accompany her home . By this hour the volcanic fires of his nature had burnt down , and having drunk no great quantity as yet he was inclined to acquiesce . She took his arm , and together they went on . Henchard walked blankly , like a blind man , repeating to himself the last words of the singers — At length he said to her , “
99039	99062	99065	99065	you	0	” These half - uttered words alarmed Elizabeth — all the more by reason of the still determination of Henchard 's mien . “
99068	99103	99105	99105	I	0	” she asked cautiously , while trembling with disquietude , and guessing Henchard 's allusion only too well . Henchard did not answer , and they went on till they had reached his cottage . “
99109	99113	99105	99105	I	0	” she said . “
99123	99276	99338	99338	He	3199	” said Henchard ; and she went away ; feeling that to caution Farfrae was almost her duty , as it was certainly her strong desire . As on the Sunday , so on the week - days , Farfrae and Lucetta might have been seen flitting about the town like two butterflies — or rather like a bee and a butterfly in league for life . She seemed to take no pleasure in going anywhere except in her husband 's company ; and hence when business would not permit him to waste an afternoon she remained indoors waiting for the time to pass till his return , her face being visible to Elizabeth - Jane from her window aloft . The latter , however , did not say to herself that Farfrae should be thankful for such devotion , but , full of her reading , she cited Rosalind 's exclamation : “
99297	99337	99341	99342	a fool	4995	” She kept her eye upon Henchard also . One day he answered her inquiry for his health by saying that he could not endure Abel Whittle 's pitying eyes upon him while they worked together in the yard . “
99344	99348	99368	99368	I	0	” said Henchard , “
99366	99367	99368	99368	I	0	” “
99385	99625	99368	99368	I	0	” said she . Her motive on going to the yard was to get an opportunity of observing the general position of affairs on Farfrae 's premises now that her stepfather was a workman there . Henchard 's threats had alarmed her so much that she wished to see his behaviour when the two were face to face . For two or three days after her arrival Donald did not make any appearance . Then one afternoon the green door opened , and through came , first Farfrae , and at his heels Lucetta . Donald brought his wife forward without hesitation , it being obvious that he had no suspicion whatever of any antecedents in common between her and the now journeyman hay - trusser . Henchard did not turn his eyes toward either of the pair , keeping them fixed on the bond he twisted , as if that alone absorbed him . A feeling of delicacy , which ever prompted Farfrae to avoid anything that might seem like triumphing over a fallen rivel , led him to keep away from the hay - barn where Henchard and his daughter were working , and to go on to the corn department . Meanwhile Lucetta , never having been informed that Henchard had entered her husband 's service , rambled straight on to the barn , where she came suddenly upon Henchard , and gave vent to a little “
99628	99674	99368	99368	I	0	” which the happy and busy Donald was too far off to hear . Henchard , with withering humility of demeanour , touched the brim of his hat to her as Whittle and the rest had done , to which she breathed a dead - alive “
99678	99679	99699	99699	I	0	” “
99687	99698	99699	99699	I	0	” said Henchard , as if he had not heard . “
99704	99708	99715	99715	ma'am	618	” she faltered . “
99717	99726	99727	99727	I	0	” he replied , touching his hat again . “
99736	99745	99757	99758	a lady	2109	” Lucetta looked embarrassed , and Henchard continued : “
99769	99785	99787	99787	you	3202	” She glanced at him entreatingly ; the sarcasm was too bitter , too unendurable . “
99795	99799	99787	99787	you	3202	” he asked . “
99802	99807	99793	99793	ma'am	618	” she said hastily ; “
99813	99814	99941	99941	you	3214	” “
99853	99939	99941	99941	you	3214	” As soon as she could do so Lucetta left him , nodded and smiled to Elizabeth - Jane , and joined her husband at the other end of the enclosure , where she could be seen leading him away by the outer gates , so as to avoid passing Henchard again . That she had been taken by surprise was obvious . The result of this casual rencounter was that the next morning a note was put into Henchard 's hand by the postman . “
99943	99960	100054	100054	Henchard	191	” said Lucetta , with as much bitterness as she could put into a small communication , “
100048	100052	100093	100093	He	3216	“ Poor fool ! ”
100064	100092	100724	100724	he	371	“ To know no better than commit herself in writing like this ! Why , if I were to show that to her dear husband — pooh ! ”
100727	100740	100766	100766	she	191	“ What — Miss Henchard — and are ye up so airly ? ”
100756	100765	100766	100766	she	191	“ But I am anxious to mention something , ”
100769	100781	100787	100787	he	371	“ And I wished not to alarm Mrs. Farfrae by calling . ”
100782	100785	100787	100787	he	371	“ Yes ? ”
100796	100814	100851	100851	she	191	“ And what may it be ? It 's very kind of ye , I 'm sure . ”
100845	100850	100851	100851	she	191	“ I sometimes fear , ”
100857	100873	100851	100851	she	191	“ that he may be betrayed into some attempt to — insult you , sir . “
100882	100883	100897	100897	he	371	” “
100903	100904	100906	100906	we	3245	” “
100911	100912	100906	100906	we	3245	” “
100929	101222	101282	101283	the Council	2127	” Every word cost her twice its length of pain . And she could see that Farfrae was still incredulous . Henchard , a poor man in his employ , was not to Farfrae 's view the Henchard who had ruled him . Yet he was not only the same man , but that man with his sinister qualities , formerly latent , quickened into life by his buffetings . Farfrae , happy , and thinking no evil , persisted in making light of her fears . Thus they parted , and she went homeward , journeymen now being in the street , waggoners going to the harness - makers for articles left to be repaired , farm - horses going to the shoeing - smiths , and the sons of labour showing themselves generally on the move . Elizabeth entered her lodging unhappily , thinking she had done no good , and only made herself appear foolish by her weak note of warning . But Donald Farfrae was one of those men upon whom an incident is never absolutely lost . He revised impressions from a subsequent point of view , and the impulsive judgment of the moment was not always his permanent one . The vision of Elizabeth 's earnest face in the rimy dawn came back to him several times during the day . Knowing the solidity of her character he did not treat her hints altogether as idle sounds . But he did not desist from a kindly scheme on Henchard 's account that engaged him just then ; and when he met Lawyer Joyce , the town - clerk , later in the day , he spoke of it as if nothing had occurred to damp it . “
101230	101234	101358	101358	Farfrae	139	” he said , “
101318	101319	101358	101358	Farfrae	139	” “
101341	101355	101391	101391	he	3253	” the town - clerk replied , in his plain , frank way . “
101416	101417	101391	101391	he	3253	” “
101428	101435	101438	101438	he	3253	” said Farfrae , looking down . “
101442	101449	101438	101438	he	3253	” added the young man bitterly ; “
101464	101465	101438	101438	he	3253	” “
101470	101478	101438	101438	he	3253	” said Joyce , lifting his eyebrows . “
101500	101501	101589	101589	I	0	” “
101596	101772	101589	101589	I	0	” It grieved Farfrae much to give up this scheme . But a damp having been thrown over it by these and other voices in the air , he went and countermanded his orders . The then occupier of the shop was in it when Farfrae spoke to him and feeling it necessary to give some explanation of his withdrawal from the negotiation Donald mentioned Henchard 's name , and stated that the intentions of the Council had been changed . The occupier was much disappointed , and straight - way informed Henchard , as soon as he saw him , that a scheme of the Council for setting him up in a shop had been knocked on the head by Farfrae . And thus out of error enmity grew . When Farfrae got indoors that evening the tea - kettle was singing on the high hob of the semi - egg - shaped grate . Lucetta , light as a sylph , ran forward and seized his hands , whereupon Farfrae duly kissed her . “
101775	101785	101796	101797	the people	4635	” she cried playfully , turning to the window . “
101806	101845	101796	101797	the people	4635	” When the candles were lighted , the curtains drawn , and the twain sat at tea , she noticed that he looked serious . Without directly inquiring why she let her eyes linger solicitously on his face . “
101850	101855	101796	101797	the people	4635	” he absently asked . “
101861	101862	101796	101797	the people	4635	” “
101865	101869	101875	101875	Donald	139	” said Lucetta . “
101877	101878	101875	101875	Donald	139	” “
101886	101891	101904	101904	Scotchmen	5313	” he responded sadly . “
101909	101910	101904	101904	Scotchmen	5313	” “
101916	101933	101978	101978	they	3265	” he said , shaking his head gloomily as he contemplated a crumb on the table . “
101992	101993	102065	102065	he	3269	” “
102048	102049	102112	102112	you	3263	” “
102135	102142	102112	102112	you	3263	” Lucetta had grown somewhat wan . “
102145	102149	102190	102190	you	3263	” she replied . “
102186	102187	102190	102190	you	3263	” “
102198	102210	102190	102190	you	3263	” said Lucetta in alarm . The words on her lips were “
102215	102241	102273	102273	I	0	” — but she did not utter them . She could not , however , suppress her agitation , and her eyes filled with tears . “
102255	102272	102275	102275	you	3263	” declared Farfrae soothingly ; though he did not know its seriousness so well as she . “
102284	102289	102340	102340	You	3263	” mournfully remarked Lucetta . “
102312	102339	102348	102349	Doctor Chalkfield	246	” Farfrae seemed seriously disposed to discuss this move , and they talked thereon till a visitor was announced . Their neighbour Alderman Vatt came in . “
102361	102393	102455	102455	ee	3263	” said Mr. Vatt . Chalkfield was the Councilman who had succeeded to the Mayoralty in the preceding November . Farfrae was sorry at the intelligence , and Mr. Vatt continued : “
102460	102461	102473	102473	I	0	” “
102484	102491	102509	102509	You	0	” said Farfrae after a pause . “
102514	102515	102516	102516	We	3273	” “
102522	102531	102543	102543	I	0	” interposed Lucetta , looking at Farfrae anxiously . “
102538	102542	102552	102557	a respectable majority in the Council	3278	” Farfrae murmured . “
102559	102560	102575	102576	older men	3279	” “
102580	102589	102630	102630	he	3283	” When he was gone Farfrae said musingly , “
102633	102688	102689	102689	Michael	120	” From this evening onward Lucetta was very uneasy . If she had not been imprudence incarnate she would not have acted as she did when she met Henchard by accident a day or two later . It was in the bustle of the market , when no one could readily notice their discourse . “
102691	102695	102757	102758	the woman	300	” said she , “
102752	102753	102777	102777	you	120	” “
102781	102800	103170	103170	I	0	” She explained how the death of her aunt had prevented her taking the journey on that day . “
102809	103169	103170	103170	I	0	” she asked . He could not say — he would consider . When she was gone he recollected that he had left a heap of useless papers in his former dining - room safe — built up in the wall of his old house — now occupied by Farfrae . The letters might have been amongst them . A grotesque grin shaped itself on Henchard 's face . Had that safe been opened ? On the very evening which followed this there was a great ringing of bells in Casterbridge , and the combined brass , wood , catgut , and leather bands played round the town with more prodigality of percussion - notes than ever . Farfrae was Mayor — the two - hundredth odd of a series forming an elective dynasty dating back to the days of Charles I — and the fair Lucetta was the courted of the town .... But , Ah ! the worm i ' the bud — Henchard ; what he could tell ! He , in the meantime , festering with indignation at some erroneous intelligence of Farfrae 's opposition to the scheme for installing him in the little seed - shop , was greeted with the news of the municipal election ( which , by reason of Farfrae 's comparative youth and his Scottish nativity — a thing unprecedented in the case — had an interest far beyond the ordinary ) . The bell - ringing and the band - playing , loud as Tamerlane 's trumpet , goaded the downfallen Henchard indescribably : the ousting now seemed to him to be complete . The next morning he went to the corn - yard as usual , and about eleven o'clock Donald entered through the green door , with no trace of the worshipful about him . The yet more emphatic change of places between him and Henchard which this election had established renewed a slight embarrassment in the manner of the modest young man ; but Henchard showed the front of one who had overlooked all this ; and Farfrae met his amenities half - way at once . “
103177	103181	103170	103170	I	0	” said Henchard , “
103201	103206	103170	103170	I	0	” He added particulars . “
103215	103219	103232	103232	I	0	” said Farfrae . “
103247	103248	103232	103232	I	0	” “
103259	103263	103265	103265	I	0	” said Henchard . “
103279	103451	103265	103265	I	0	” It was quite late when he fulfilled his promise . He had primed himself with grog , as he did very frequently now , and a curl of sardonic humour hung on his lip as he approached the house , as though he were contemplating some terrible form of amusement . Whatever it was , the incident of his entry did not diminish its force , this being his first visit to the house since he had lived there as owner . The ring of the bell spoke to him like the voice of a familiar drudge who had been bribed to forsake him ; the movements of the doors were revivals of dead days . Farfrae invited him into the dining - room , where he at once unlocked the iron safe built into the wall , HIS , Henchard 's safe , made by an ingenious locksmith under his direction . Farfrae drew thence the parcel , and other papers , with apologies for not having returned them . “
103455	103460	103265	103265	I	0	” said Henchard drily . “
103471	103485	103512	103512	She	139	” he went on , sitting down and unfolding Lucetta 's passionate bundle , “
103510	103511	103512	103512	She	139	” “
103529	103555	103512	103512	She	139	” Henchard returned to the letters , sorting them over with interest , Farfrae being seated at the other end of the dining - table . “
103564	103568	103609	103609	God	126	” he resumed , “
103617	103618	103609	103609	God	126	” “
103626	103630	103632	103632	she	1434	” asked Farfrae . “
103639	103643	103672	103674	an angry woman	3296	” said Henchard . “
103678	103701	103672	103674	an angry woman	3296	” Farfrae , willing to humour Henchard , though quite uninterested , and bursting with yawns , gave well - mannered attention . “
103707	103711	103842	103842	she	3302	” Henchard read , “
103837	103838	103842	103842	she	3302	” “
103848	103852	103842	103842	she	3302	” said Henchard , “
103870	103871	103842	103842	she	3302	” “
103874	103879	103886	103886	women	4948	” said Farfrae absently , “
103888	103957	103960	103960	I	0	” But the fact was that he knew very little of the sex ; yet detecting a sort of resemblance in style between the effusions of the woman he worshipped and those of the supposed stranger , he concluded that Aphrodite ever spoke thus , whosesoever the personality she assumed . Henchard unfolded another letter , and read it through likewise , stopping at the subscription as before . “
103965	103970	103983	103983	I	0	” he said blandly . “
103993	103994	103983	103983	I	0	” “
104003	104007	104012	104012	you	0	” said Farfrae . “
104021	104043	104075	104075	her	3302	” Farfrae asked this and the other questions in the comfortably indifferent tone of one whom the matter very remotely concerned . “
104052	104070	104101	104101	She	3302	” said Henchard , the new - moon - shaped grin adumbrating itself again upon his mouth . “
104099	104100	104101	104101	She	3302	” “
104109	104131	104101	104101	She	3302	” Henchard seemed to think it would be sailing too near the wind to descend further into particulars , and he answered “
104134	104135	104152	104152	She	3302	” “
104150	104151	104155	104155	she	3302	” “
104158	104292	104596	104596	he	122	” said Henchard emphatically . He opened a third and fourth letter , and read . This time he approached the conclusion as if the signature were indeed coming with the rest . But again he stopped short . The truth was that , as may be divined , he had quite intended to effect a grand catastrophe at the end of this drama by reading out the name , he had come to the house with no other thought . But sitting here in cold blood he could not do it . Such a wrecking of hearts appalled even him . His quality was such that he could have annihilated them both in the heat of action ; but to accomplish the deed by oral poison was beyond the nerve of his enmity .
104591	104595	104596	104596	he	122	“ One word , ”
104614	104641	104649	104649	Henchard	122	“ Is it quite fair to this young woman 's memory to read at such length to a stranger what was intended for your eye alone ? ”
104642	104647	104649	104649	Henchard	122	“ Well , yes , ”
104651	104673	104695	104695	he	122	“ By not giving her name I make it an example of all womankind , and not a scandal to one . ”
104674	104684	104695	104695	he	122	“ If I were you I would destroy them , ”
104700	104716	104728	104728	Henchard	122	“ As another man 's wife it would injure the woman if it were known . ”
104717	104726	104959	104959	he	387	“ No , I shall not destroy them , ”
104945	104958	104959	104959	he	387	“ Of all men he was the least desirable as a visitor , ”
104962	105005	105018	105018	Henchard	122	“ but it is my belief that he 's just a bit crazed . He has been reading to me a long lot of letters relating to his past life ; and I could do no less than indulge him by listening . ”
105039	105060	105215	105215	she	214	“ Well — I 'm obliged to ' ee for listening . I may tell more about her some day . ”
105230	105339	105342	105342	she	3334	“ I overheard your interview with my husband last night , and saw the drift of your revenge . The very thought of it crushes me ! Have pity on a distressed woman ! If you could see me you would relent . You do not know how anxiety has told upon me lately . I will be at the Ring at the time you leave work — just before the sun goes down . Please come that way . I can not rest till I have seen you face to face , and heard from your mouth that you will carry this horse - play no further . ”
105351	105372	105781	105781	he	3341	“ If ever tears and pleadings have served the weak to fight the strong , let them do so now ! ”
105800	105816	105824	105824	she	214	“ Goodnight t'ye . Of course I 'm glad to come if you want me . ”
105817	105823	105841	105841	he	3341	“ O , thank you , ”
105828	105840	105860	105860	she	214	“ I am sorry to see ' ee looking so ill , ”
105852	105859	105860	105860	she	214	“ How can you be sorry , ”
105863	105870	105876	105876	Henchard	122	“ when you deliberately cause it ? ”
105871	105874	105876	105876	Henchard	122	“ What ! ”
105879	105894	105903	105903	she	214	“ Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that ? ”
105895	105902	105903	105903	she	214	“ It is all your doing , ”
105906	105976	106106	106106	he	122	“ I have no other grief . My happiness would be secure enough but for your threats . O Michael ! do n't wreck me like this ! You might think that you have done enough ! When I came here I was a young woman ; now I am rapidly becoming an old one . Neither my husband nor any other man will regard me with interest long . ”
106094	106105	106106	106106	he	122	“ Well , what do you want me to do ? ”
106110	106138	106231	106231	Henchard	122	“ I am sure I shall be very willing . My reading of those letters was only a sort of practical joke , and I revealed nothing . ”
106139	106159	106231	106231	Henchard	122	“ To give me back the letters and any papers you may have that breathe of matrimony or worse . ”
106160	106195	106200	106200	she	214	“ So be it . Every scrap shall be yours .... But , between you and me , Lucetta , he is sure to find out something of the matter , sooner or later . ”
106196	106199	106200	106200	she	214	“ Ah ! ”
106206	106230	106257	106257	he	122	“ but not till I have proved myself a faithful and deserving wife to him , and then he may forgive me everything ! ”
106249	106256	106257	106257	he	122	“ H'm — I hope so , ”
106260	106281	106296	106296	He	122	“ But you shall have the letters without fail . And your secret shall be kept . I swear it . ”
106282	106295	106317	106317	he	122	“ How good you are ! — how shall I get them ? ”
106309	106316	106317	106317	he	122	“ Now do n't doubt me , ”
106320	106327	106451	106451	Lucetta	214	“ I can keep my word . ”
106439	106449	106470	106470	Jopp	137	“ It is a thing I know nothing about , ”
106454	106468	106470	106470	Jopp	137	“ But you can testify to my trustworthiness better than anybody , ma'am , ”
106472	106487	106492	106492	she	214	“ I was in Jersey several years , and knew you there by sight . ”
106488	106491	106492	106492	she	214	“ Indeed , ”
106495	106503	106528	106528	he	137	“ But I knew nothing of you . ”
106504	106527	106640	106640	Henchard	122	“ I think , ma'am , that a word or two from you would secure for me what I covet very much , ”
106634	106638	106694	106694	He	122	“ I wish , ”
106642	106693	106757	106758	his lodger	3363	“ you would do me a service , Jopp , now — to - night , I mean , if you can . Leave this at Mrs. Farfrae 's for her . I should take it myself , of course , but I do n't wish to be seen there . ”
106744	106756	106757	106758	his lodger	3363	“ Well , how have ye got on to - day ? ”
106761	106768	106777	106777	Jopp	137	“ Any prospect of an opening ? ”
106769	106775	106801	106801	Henchard	122	“ I am afraid not , ”
106791	106799	106812	106812	He	122	“ There never will be in Casterbridge , ”
106804	106811	107147	107148	Mrs. Cuxsom	159	“ You must roam further afield . ”
107124	107145	107147	107148	Mrs. Cuxsom	159	“ We be just going down Mixen Lane way , to look into Peter 's Finger afore creeping to bed , ”
107150	107184	107998	107998	copyholders	3433	“ There 's a fiddle and tambourine going on there . Lord , what 's all the world — do ye come along too , Jopp — ' twon't hinder ye five minutes . ”
107991	107994	108526	108528	a deposed keeper	3473	“ liviers , ”
108503	108525	108526	108528	a deposed keeper	3473	“ Dost mind how you could jerk a trout ashore with a bramble , and not ruffle the stream , Charl ? ”
108532	108548	108823	108824	the keeper	3474	“ ' Twas at that I caught ' ee once , if you can mind ? ”
108549	108591	108599	108599	Jopp	137	“ That I can . But the worst larry for me was that pheasant business at Yalbury Wood . Your wife swore false that time , Joe — O , by Gad , she did — there 's no denying it . ”
108592	108597	108599	108599	Jopp	137	“ How was that ? ”
108601	108809	108823	108824	the keeper	3474	“ Why — Joe closed wi ' me , and we rolled down together , close to his garden hedge . Hearing the noise , out ran his wife with the oven pyle , and it being dark under the trees she could n't see which was uppermost . ' Where beest thee , Joe , under or top ? ' she screeched . ' O — under , by Gad ! ' says he . She then began to rap down upon my skull , back , and ribs with the pyle till we 'd roll over again . ' Where beest now , dear Joe , under or top ? ' she 'd scream again . By George , ' twas through her I was took ! And then when we got up in hall she sware that the cock pheasant was one of her rearing , when ' twas not your bird at all , Joe ; ' twas Squire Brown 's bird — that 's whose ' twas — one that we 'd picked off as we passed his wood , an hour afore . It did hurt my feelings to be so wronged ! ... Ah well — ' tis over now . ”
108810	108821	108823	108824	the keeper	3474	“ I might have had ' ee days afore that , ”
108826	108851	108870	108881	the furmity - woman , who , lately settled in this purlieu	3475	“ I was within a few yards of ' ee dozens of times , with a sight more of birds than that poor one . ”
108852	108868	108934	108934	Jopp	137	“ Yes — ' tis not our greatest doings that the world gets wind of , ”
108923	108932	108934	108934	Jopp	137	“ Ah , therein lies a grand secret , ”
108936	108962	108896	108896	she	3475	“ It is the passion of love . To think that a woman should love one man so well , and hate another so unmercifully . ”
108963	108974	108934	108934	Jopp	137	“ Who 's the object of your meditation , sir ? ”
108975	109033	109049	109050	Mother Cuxsom	145	“ One that stands high in this town . I 'd like to shame her ! Upon my life , ' twould be as good as a play to read her love - letters , the proud piece of silk and wax - work ! For ' tis her love - letters that I 've got here . ”
109034	109047	109049	109050	Mother Cuxsom	145	“ Love letters ? then let 's hear 'em , good soul , ”
109052	109106	109183	109184	Nance Mockridge	158	“ Lord , do ye mind , Richard , what fools we used to be when we were younger ? Getting a schoolboy to write ours for us ; and giving him a penny , do ye mind , not to tell other folks what he 'd put inside , do ye mind ? ”
109175	109181	109183	109184	Nance Mockridge	158	“ Mrs. Farfrae wrote that ! ”
109186	109219	109230	109234	the aged furmity - woman	3477	“ ' Tis a humbling thing for us , as respectable women , that one of the same sex could do it . And now she 's avowed herself to another man ! ”
109220	109228	109230	109234	the aged furmity - woman	3477	“ So much the better for her , ”
109236	109259	109276	109276	Nance	158	“ Ah , I saved her from a real bad marriage , and she 's never been the one to thank me . ”
109260	109274	109283	109284	Mrs. Cuxsom	159	“ I say , what a good foundation for a skimmity - ride , ”
109278	109281	109283	109284	Mrs. Cuxsom	159	“ True , ”
109288	109330	109341	109342	the landlady	972	“ ' Tis as good a ground for a skimmity - ride as ever I knowed ; and it ought not to be wasted . The last one seen in Casterbridge must have been ten years ago , if a day . ”
109353	109371	109511	109511	he	3490	“ ' Tis Jim coming in . Would ye go and let down the bridge for me ? ”
109506	109510	109511	109511	he	3490	“ Not much , ”
109515	109520	109603	109608	some one from the other side	3496	“ All safe inside ? ”
109557	109559	109603	109608	some one from the other side	3496	“ Ahoy ”
109591	109601	109617	109617	Charl	254	“ Ahoy — is this the way to Casterbridge ? ”
109610	109615	109617	109617	Charl	254	“ Not in particular , ”
109619	109628	109643	109647	the man in the moor	3497	“ There 's a river afore ' ee . ”
109629	109641	109643	109647	the man in the moor	3497	“ I do n't care — here 's for through it ! ”
109649	109660	109670	109670	Charl	254	“ I 've had travelling enough for to - day . ”
109661	109668	109670	109670	Charl	254	“ Stop a minute , then , ”
109680	109716	109643	109647	the man in the moor	3497	“ Joe , bring the plank and lantern ; here 's somebody that 's lost his way . You should have kept along the turnpike road , friend , and not have strook across here . ”
109717	109748	109826	109826	he	2118	“ I should — as I see now . But I saw a light here , and says I to myself , that 's an outlying house , depend on't . ”
109819	109825	109826	109826	he	2118	“ What place is this ? ”
109835	109841	109877	109877	They	3502	“ A public - house . ”
109842	109876	110080	110080	he	2118	“ Ah , perhaps it will suit me to put up at . Now then , come in and wet your whistle at my expense for the lift over you have given me . ”
110066	110079	110090	110091	the landlady	972	“ What do they mean by a ' skimmity - ride ' ? ”
110083	110088	110090	110091	the landlady	972	“ O , sir ! ”
110101	110140	110159	110159	I	0	“ ' tis a ' old foolish thing they do in these parts when a man 's wife is — well , not too particularly his own . But as a respectable householder I do n't encourage it . “
110162	110163	110166	110166	sir	4588	” “
110168	110188	110166	110166	sir	4588	” she simpered . And then , bursting into naturalness , and glancing from the corner of her eye , “
110203	110204	110258	110259	good folks	3515	” “
110241	110255	110351	110351	George	256	” He turned back , entered the sitting - room , and said , “
110287	110320	110351	110351	George	256	” He threw a sovereign on the table and returned to the landlady at the door , of whom , having inquired the way into the town , he took his leave . “
110330	110349	110386	110386	God	126	” said Charl when the sovereign had been taken up and handed to the landlady for safe keeping . “
110367	110368	110386	110386	God	126	” “
110373	110378	110389	110389	I	0	” answered the landlady . “
110399	110400	110389	110389	I	0	” “
110403	110407	110426	110426	We	3516	” said Jopp ; “
110424	110425	110426	110426	We	3516	” “
110429	110433	110426	110426	We	3516	” said Nance . “
110452	110575	110989	110989	he	122	” Jopp gathered up the letters , and it being now somewhat late he did not attempt to call at Farfrae 's with them that night . He reached home , sealed them up as before , and delivered the parcel at its address next morning . Within an hour its contents were reduced to ashes by Lucetta , who , poor soul ! was inclined to fall down on her knees in thankfulness that at last no evidence remained of the unlucky episode with Henchard in her past . For though hers had been rather the laxity of inadvertence than of intention , that episode , if known , was not the less likely to operate fatally between herself and her husband .
110982	110988	110989	110989	he	122	“ I have a feeling , ”
111005	111030	111124	111124	he	122	“ that I should like to join ye in this reception of our illustrious visitor . I suppose I could walk with the rest ? ”
111109	111122	111124	111124	he	122	“ I hardly see that it would be proper , Mr. Henchard , ”
111126	111162	111178	111178	Farfrae	139	“ The Council are the Council , and as ye are no longer one of the body , there would be an irregularity in the proceeding . If ye were included , why not others ? ”
111163	111177	111195	111195	he	122	“ I have a particular reason for wishing to assist at the ceremony . ”
111182	111194	111195	111195	he	122	“ I think I have expressed the feeling of the Council , ”
111198	111203	111208	111209	Lawyer Long	260	“ Yes , yes , ”
111218	111235	111277	111277	Henchard	120	“ Then I am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it officially ? ”
111236	111276	111328	111328	he	120	“ I am afraid so ; it is out of the question , indeed . But of course you can see the doings full well , such as they are to be , like the rest of the spectators . ”
111315	111327	111328	111328	he	120	“ I 'll welcome his Royal Highness , or nobody shall ! ”
111333	111359	111562	111562	he	120	“ I am not going to be sat upon by Farfrae , or any of the rest of the paltry crew ! You shall see . ”
111556	111561	111562	111562	he	120	“ It was lucky , ”
111567	111593	111601	111601	she	191	“ my twenty - one years had expired before this came on , or I should never have had the nerve to carry it out . ”
111594	111599	111618	111618	She	191	“ Carry out what ? ”
111605	111617	111632	111632	she	191	“ This welcome I am going to give our Royal visitor . ”
111622	111631	111632	111632	she	191	“ Shall we go and see it together ? ”
111635	111656	112414	112416	All the ladies	3603	“ See it ! I have other fish to fry . You see it . It will be worth seeing ! ”
112422	112428	112576	112577	Mrs. Blowbody	262	“ O , look there ! ”
112563	112574	112594	112594	Donald	139	“ Why — it is your husband 's old patron ! ”
112589	112592	112617	112618	Mrs. Bath	263	“ Patron ! ”
112601	112615	112649	112649	Lucetta	214	“ Do you say the man is an acquaintance of Mr. Farfrae 's ? ”
112640	112647	112649	112649	Lucetta	214	“ He works for my husband , ”
112651	112684	112736	112736	Lucetta	214	“ Oh — is that all ? They have been saying to me that it was through him your husband first got a footing in Casterbridge . What stories people will tell ! ”
112685	112732	112899	112900	the first	5656	“ They will indeed . It was not so at all . Donald 's genius would have enabled him to get a footing anywhere , without anybody 's help ! He would have been just the same if there had been no Henchard in the world ! ”
112882	112897	112899	112900	the first	5656	“ Some difference between him now and when he zung at the Dree Mariners , ”
112902	112926	112873	112874	the crowd	347	“ ' Tis wonderful how he could get a lady of her quality to go snacks wi ' en in such quick time . ”
112927	112964	112979	112980	Nance Mockridge	158	“ True . Yet how folk do worship fine clothes ! Now there 's a better - looking woman than she that nobody notices at all , because she 's akin to that hontish fellow Henchard . ”
112965	112977	113028	113028	she	158	“ I could worship ye , Buzz , for saying that , ”
112982	113027	113049	113049	Longways	131	“ I do like to see the trimming pulled off such Christmas candles . I am quite unequal to the part of villain myself , or I 'd gi'e all my small silver to see that lady toppered .... And perhaps I shall soon , ”
113032	113047	113172	113172	Buzzford	142	“ That 's not a noble passiont for a ' oman to keep up , ”
113158	113170	113178	113178	Coney	132	“ You know what 's brewing down there , I suppose ? ”
113183	113190	113208	113208	Longways	131	“ Not the skimmity - ride ? ”
113194	113206	113208	113208	Longways	131	“ I have my doubts if it will be carried out , ”
113210	113224	113227	113227	they	3635	“ If they are getting it up they are keeping it mighty close . “
113240	113241	113247	113247	I	0	” “
113252	113257	113312	113312	their	3635	” said Longways emphatically . “
113318	113415	113423	113423	Christopher	132	” Coney reflected . Farfrae was still liked in the community ; but it must be owned that , as the Mayor and man of money , engrossed with affairs and ambitions , he had lost in the eyes of the poorer inhabitants something of that wondrous charm which he had had for them as a light - hearted penniless young man , who sang ditties as readily as the birds in the trees . Hence the anxiety to keep him from annoyance showed not quite the ardour that would have animated it in former days . “
113425	113429	113423	113423	Christopher	132	” continued Longways ; “
113459	113476	113423	113423	Christopher	132	” This course was decided on , and the group separated , Buzzford saying to Coney , “
113496	113518	113423	113423	Christopher	132	” These well - intentioned ones would have been surprised had they known how ripe the great jocular plot really was . “
113525	113541	113606	113606	they	3635	” Jopp had said to the Peter 's party at the corner of Mixen Lane . “
113569	113585	113820	113820	Jopp	137	” To him , at least , it was not a joke , but a retaliation .
113810	113818	113831	113831	Henchard	191	“ So you 've had a snub , ”
113822	113829	113854	113854	He	387	“ And what if I have ? ”
113834	113853	113889	113889	He	387	“ Why , I 've had one too , so we are both under the same cold shade . ”
113897	114007	114227	114227	he	3655	“ She has supplicated to me in her time ; and now her tongue wo n't own me nor her eyes see me ! ... And he — how angry he looked . He drove me back as if I were a bull breaking fence .... I took it like a lamb , for I saw it could not be settled there . He can rub brine on a green wound ! ... But he shall pay for it , and she shall be sorry . It must come to a tussle — face to face ; and then we 'll see how a coxcomb can front a man ! ”
114233	114240	114640	114640	he	3655	“ I 'm stronger than he . ”
114630	114639	114640	114640	he	3655	“ No ; I ca n't do it ! ”
114643	114653	114677	114677	he	3655	“ Why does the infernal fool begin that now ! ”
114669	114676	114687	114687	Farfrae	139	“ Will ye come up here ? ”
114680	114685	114687	114687	Farfrae	139	“ Ay , man , ”
114689	114700	114758	114758	he	3655	“ I could n't see ye . What 's wrang ? ”
114746	114757	114780	114780	He	3655	“ What are you doing up here at this time ? ”
114764	114779	114870	114870	Henchard	191	“ Why did n't ye take your holiday like the rest of the men ? ”
114865	114868	114870	114870	Henchard	191	“ Now , ”
114873	114912	114922	114922	Farfrae	139	“ we stand face to face — man and man . Your money and your fine wife no longer lift ' ee above me as they did but now , and my poverty does not press me down . ”
114913	114920	114922	114922	Farfrae	139	“ What does it all mean ? ”
114925	114983	114998	114998	he	3683	“ Wait a bit , my lad . You should ha ' thought twice before you affronted to extremes a man who had nothing to lose . I 've stood your rivalry , which ruined me , and your snubbing , which humbled me ; but your hustling , that disgraced me , I wo n't stand ! ”
114991	114997	114998	114998	he	3683	“ Ye'd no business there , ”
115001	115028	115035	115035	his	3683	“ As much as any one among ye ! What , you forward stripling , tell a man of my age he 'd no business there ! ”
115041	115063	115071	115071	Henchard	191	“ You insulted Royalty , Henchard ; and ' twas my duty , as the chief magistrate , to stop you . ”
115064	115069	115071	115071	Henchard	191	“ Royalty be damned , ”
115073	115085	115035	115035	his	3683	“ I am as loyal as you , come to that ! ”
115086	115117	115130	115130	Henchard	191	“ I am not here to argue . Wait till you cool doon , wait till you cool ; and you will see things the same way as I do . ”
115118	115128	115130	115130	Henchard	191	“ You may be the one to cool first , ”
115133	115249	115757	115757	Henchard	191	“ Now this is the case . Here be we , in this four - square loft , to finish out that little wrestle you began this morning . There 's the door , forty foot above ground . One of us two puts the other out by that door — the master stays inside . If he likes he may go down afterwards and give the alarm that the other has fallen out by accident — or he may tell the truth — that 's his business . As the strongest man I 've tied one arm to take no advantage of ' ee . D'ye understand ? Then here 's at ' ee ! ”
115752	115755	115757	115757	Henchard	191	“ Now , ”
115762	115781	115792	115792	Farfrae	139	“ this is the end of what you began this morning . Your life is in my hands . ”
115782	115790	115792	115792	Farfrae	139	“ Then take it , take it ! ”
115794	115801	115826	115826	he	4511	“ Ye've wished to long enough ! ”
115815	115825	115889	115889	He	4511	“ O Farfrae ! — that 's not true ! ”
115830	115888	116158	116158	he	4511	“ God is my witness that no man ever loved another as I did thee at one time .... And now — though I came here to kill ' ee , I can not hurt thee ! Go and give me in charge — do what you will — I care nothing for what comes of me ! ”
116149	116157	116158	116158	he	4511	“ He thought highly of me once , ”
116161	116173	116691	116691	Whittle	171	“ Now he 'll hate me and despise me for ever ! ”
116703	116705	117228	117229	the first	5656	“ immediate ”
117218	117226	117245	117246	the second	4874	“ Which way be they going now ? ”
117233	117243	117245	117246	the second	4874	“ I ca n't be sure for a moment , ”
117248	117272	117280	117281	the first	5656	“ because of the malter 's chimbley . O yes — I can see 'em . Well , I declare , I declare ! ”
117273	117278	117280	117281	the first	5656	“ What , what ? ”
117286	117302	117245	117246	the second	4874	“ They are coming up Corn Street after all ! They sit back to back ! ”
117303	117315	117245	117246	the second	4874	“ What — two of 'em — are there two figures ? ”
117316	117350	117280	117281	the first	5656	“ Yes . Two images on a donkey , back to back , their elbows tied to one another 's ! She 's facing the head , and he 's facing the tail . ”
117351	117360	117245	117246	the second	4874	“ Is it meant for anybody in particular ? ”
117361	117400	117426	117429	the disappointed first maid	3741	“ Well — it mid be . The man has got on a blue coat and kerseymere leggings ; he has black whiskers , and a reddish face . ' Tis a stuffed figure , with a falseface . ”
117413	117424	117446	117455	the one who occupied the enviable position in the attic	3742	“ There — I sha n't see , after all ! ”
117431	117444	117446	117455	the one who occupied the enviable position in the attic	3742	“ They have gone into a back street — that 's all , ”
117457	117469	117245	117246	the second	4874	“ There — now I have got 'em all endways nicely ! ”
117470	117498	117532	117532	Lucetta	214	“ What 's the woman like ? Just say , and I can tell in a moment if ' tis meant for one I 've in mind . ”
117499	117531	117571	117571	she	191	“ My — why — ' tis dressed just as SHE dressed when she sat in the front seat at the time the play - actors came to the Town Hall ! ”
117562	117570	117571	117571	she	191	“ I have come to see you , ”
117575	117601	117636	117636	she	214	“ I did not stop to knock — forgive me ! I see you have not shut your shutters , and the window is open . ”
117628	117635	117646	117646	she	214	“ Let it be — hush ! ”
117687	117723	117748	117748	she	214	“ Her neck is uncovered , and her hair in bands , and her back - comb in place ; she 's got on a puce silk , and white stockings , and coloured shoes . ”
117742	117747	117748	117748	she	214	“ ' Tis me ! ”
117758	117773	117795	117797	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ A procession — a scandal — an effigy of me , and him ! ”
117786	117793	117795	117797	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ Let us shut it out , ”
117824	117831	117840	117840	she	191	“ Let us shut it out ! ”
117832	117839	117891	117891	Elizabeth	191	“ It is of no use ! ”
117843	117890	117911	117911	she	191	“ He will see it , wo n't he ? Donald will see it ! He is just coming home — and it will break his heart — he will never love me any more — and O , it will kill me — kill me ! ”
117898	117910	117926	117926	She	191	“ O , ca n't something be done to stop it ? ”
117914	117925	117939	117939	herself	214	“ Is there nobody to do it — not one ? ”
117943	117949	118036	118036	Elizabeth	191	“ I will see it ! ”
118027	118034	118036	118036	Elizabeth	191	“ Come in , come in , ”
118038	118046	118067	118067	Lucetta	214	“ and let me shut the window ! ”
118047	118065	118308	118308	he	2617	“ She 's me — she 's me — even to the parasol — my green parasol ! ”
118319	118324	118332	118332	Elizabeth	191	“ This is serious . ”
118325	118331	118332	118332	Elizabeth	191	“ It is a fit , ”
118335	118364	118377	118380	the parlour - maid	2064	“ Yes . But a fit in the present state of her health means mischief . You must send at once for Mr. Farfrae . Where is he ? ”
118365	118375	118377	118380	the parlour - maid	2064	“ He has driven into the country , sir , ”
118382	118399	118418	118419	The doctor	2617	“ to some place on the Budmouth Road . He 's likely to be back soon . ”
118400	118417	118608	118608	Stubberd	223	“ Never mind , he must be sent for , in case he should not hurry . ”
118593	118606	118608	118608	Stubberd	223	“ What can we two poor lammigers do against such a multitude ! ”
118618	118664	118608	118608	Stubberd	223	“ ' Tis tempting 'em to commit felo - de - se upon us , and that would be the death of the perpetrator ; and we would n't be the cause of a fellow - creature 's death on no account , not we ! ”
118665	118701	118608	118608	Stubberd	223	“ Get some help , then ! Here , I 'll come with you . We 'll see what a few words of authority can do . Quick now ; have you got your staves ? ”
118702	118736	118608	118608	Stubberd	223	“ We did n't want the folk to notice us as law officers , being so short - handed , sir ; so we pushed our Gover'ment staves up this water - pipe . ”
118737	118762	118785	118785	Blowbody	267	“ Out with 'em , and come along , for Heaven 's sake ! Ah , here 's Mr. Blowbody ; that 's lucky . ”
118775	118783	118785	118785	Blowbody	267	“ Well , what 's the row ? ”
118787	118794	118802	118802	Grower	229	“ Got their names — hey ? ”
118795	118800	118802	118802	Grower	229	“ No . Now , ”
118809	118855	118940	118940	Grower	229	“ you go with Mr. Blowbody round by the Old Walk and come up the street ; and I 'll go with Stubberd straight forward . By this plan we shall have 'em between us . Get their names only : no attack or interruption . ”
118928	118939	118940	118940	Grower	229	“ Have you seen a motley crowd making a disturbance ? ”
118964	118971	118998	118998	his	254	“ Beg yer pardon , sir ? ”
119007	119027	119049	119050	Mr. Grower	229	“ No ; we have n't seen anything ; have we , Joe ? And you was here afore I. ”
119040	119047	119071	119071	he	229	“ H'm — that 's odd , ”
119052	119070	119071	119071	he	229	“ Ah — here 's a respectable man coming that I know by sight . Have you , ”
119081	119105	119115	119115	Jopp	137	“ have you seen any gang of fellows making a devil of a noise — skimmington riding , or something of the sort ? ”
119106	119114	119115	119115	Jopp	137	“ O no — nothing , sir , ”
119126	119138	119151	119152	the magistrate	2758	“ But I 've not been far tonight , so perhaps — ”
119139	119149	119195	119195	Jopp	137	“ Oh , ' twas here — just here , ”
119154	119194	119199	119199	he	137	“ Now I 've noticed , come to think o't that the wind in the Walk trees makes a peculiar poetical - like murmur to - night , sir ; more than common ; so perhaps ' twas that ? ”
119230	119259	119317	119318	Mr. Grower	229	“ No , no , no — d'ye think I 'm a fool ? Constable , come this way . They must have gone into the back street . ”
119312	119315	119317	119318	Mr. Grower	229	“ Now , ”
119320	119371	119552	119552	They	3792	“ there 's only one thing more we can do . Get ye half - a - dozen helpers , and go in a body to Mixen Lane , and into Peter 's finger . I 'm much mistaken if you do n't find a clue to the perpetrators there . ”
119532	119551	119563	119563	Stubberd	223	“ Good evening , gentlemen ; there 's plenty of room . I hope there 's nothing amiss ? ”
119558	119561	119563	119563	Stubberd	223	“ Surely , ”
119570	119587	119615	119615	he	291	“ I saw you by now in Corn Street — Mr. Grower spoke to ' ee ? ”
119600	119614	119615	119615	he	291	“ I 've been here this last hour , hain't I , Nance ? ”
119628	119659	119706	119706	he	3806	“ Faith , that you have . I came in for my quiet suppertime half - pint , and you were here then , as well as all the rest . ”
119696	119705	119723	119723	she	972	“ Something curious about that oven , ma'am ! ”
119719	119722	119723	119723	she	972	“ Ah , ”
119727	119761	120049	120049	Henchard	191	“ that 's what we keep here to use when there 's a little quiet dancing . You see damp weather spoils it , so I put it there to keep it dry . ”
120037	120047	120049	120049	Henchard	191	“ But he has gone to Mellstock and Weatherbury ! ”
120055	120062	120453	120453	Henchard	191	“ Not Budmouth way at all . ”
120443	120449	120477	120477	He	149	“ Farfrae — Mr. Farfrae ! ”
120484	120487	120509	120509	Henchard	191	“ Yes ? ”
120500	120508	120509	120509	Henchard	191	“ Come back to Casterbridge at once ! ”
120512	120538	120665	120665	he	149	“ There 's something wrong at your house — requiring your return . I 've run all the way here on purpose to tell ye . ”
120651	120659	120665	120665	he	149	“ I have to go to Mellstock , ”
120673	120676	120665	120665	he	149	“ But , ”
120680	120712	120762	120762	He	149	“ the matter is more serious than your business at Mellstock . It is — your wife ! She is ill . I can tell you particulars as we go along . ”
120767	120774	120813	120813	he	149	“ I know what you think , ”
120803	120812	120813	120813	he	149	“ But I am not what you think ! ”
120817	120887	121154	121154	they	3863	“ Believe me , Farfrae ; I have come entirely on your own and your wife 's account . She is in danger . I know no more ; and they want you to come . Your man has gone the other way in a mistake . O Farfrae ! do n't mistrust me — I am a wretched man ; but my heart is true to you still ! ”
121161	121169	121200	121201	the doctor	2617	“ O — it is not he ! ”
121190	121198	121200	121201	the doctor	2617	“ But have n't you found him ? ”
121203	121213	121217	121217	he	149	“ Yes .... I can not tell ' ee ! ”
121227	121237	121243	121244	the surgeon	3866	“ He ca n't be home for two hours . ”
121238	121241	121256	121256	Henchard	191	“ H'm , ”
121249	121254	121296	121296	Henchard	191	“ How is she ? ”
121267	121295	121478	121478	Jopp	137	“ In great danger , father . Her anxiety to see her husband makes her fearfully restless . Poor woman — I fear they have killed her ! ”
121481	121492	121498	121498	Henchard	191	“ This is rather bad about Mrs. Farfrae 's illness . ”
121493	121496	121540	121540	Jopp	137	“ Yes , ”
121531	121538	121546	121546	himself	191	“ Somebody has called for you , ”
121552	121566	121516	121516	his	3871	“ A kind of traveller , or sea - captain of some sort . ”
121567	121576	121546	121546	himself	191	“ Oh ? — who could he be ? ”
121577	121606	121622	121622	Henchard	191	“ He seemed a well - be - doing man — had grey hair and a broadish face ; but he gave no name , and no message . ”
121607	121616	122288	122288	Henchard	191	“ Nor do I gi'e him any attention . ”
122278	122286	122312	122312	she	3897	“ Why do you take off that ? ”
122315	122334	122414	122414	she	3897	“ Because they may knock as loud as they will ; she will never hear it any more . ”
122408	122413	122397	122397	She	3897	“ Have you heard ? ”
122417	122435	122443	122443	Henchard	191	“ Mrs. Farfrae ! She is — dead ! Yes , indeed — about an hour ago ! ”
122436	122441	122443	122443	Henchard	191	“ I know it , ”
122445	122516	122795	122796	the stranger	2118	“ I have but lately come in from there . It is so very good of ' ee , Elizabeth , to come and tell me . You must be so tired out , too , with sitting up . Now do you bide here with me this morning . You can go and rest in the other room ; and I will call ' ee when breakfast is ready . ”
122786	122793	122795	122796	the stranger	2118	“ Good morning , good morning , ”
122801	122811	122779	122779	Henchard	191	“ Is it Mr. Henchard I am talking to ? ”
122812	122818	122795	122796	the stranger	2118	“ My name is Henchard . ”
122819	122851	122858	122858	Henchard	120	“ Then I 've caught ' ee at home — that 's right . Morning 's the time for business , says I. Can I have a few words with you ? ”
122852	122857	122878	122878	himself	3915	“ By all means , ”
122866	122872	122887	122887	his	120	“ You may remember me ? ”
122890	122903	122928	122928	Henchard	120	“ Well — perhaps you may not . My name is Newson . ”
122920	122927	122928	122928	Henchard	120	“ I know the name well , ”
122938	123083	122928	122928	Henchard	120	“ I make no doubt of that . Well , the fact is , I 've been looking for ' ee this fortnight past . I landed at Havenpool and went through Casterbridge on my way to Falmouth , and when I got there , they told me you had some years before been living at Casterbridge . Back came I again , and by long and by late I got here by coach , ten minutes ago . ' He lives down by the mill , ' says they . So here I am . Now — that transaction between us some twenty years agone — ' tis that I 've called about . ' Twas a curious business . I was younger then than I am now , and perhaps the less said about it , in one sense , the better . ”
123084	123123	123133	123133	Newson	127	“ Curious business ! ' Twas worse than curious . I can not even allow that I 'm the man you met then . I was not in my senses , and a man 's senses are himself . ”
123124	123131	123133	123133	Newson	127	“ We were young and thoughtless , ”
123135	123158	122928	122928	Henchard	120	“ However , I 've come to mend matters rather than open arguments . Poor Susan — hers was a strange experience . ”
123159	123189	122928	122928	Henchard	120	“ She was a warm - hearted , home - spun woman . She was not what they call shrewd or sharp at all — better she had been . ”
123190	123195	123133	123133	Newson	127	“ She was not . ”
123196	123240	123258	123258	Henchard	120	“ As you in all likelihood know , she was simple - minded enough to think that the sale was in a way binding . She was as guiltless o ' wrong - doing in that particular as a saint in the clouds . ”
123241	123256	123258	123258	Henchard	120	“ I know it , I know it . I found it out directly , ”
123265	123319	123340	123344	the sailor of former days	3917	“ There lay the sting o't to me . If she had seen it as what it was she would never have left me . Never ! But how should she be expected to know ? What advantages had she ? None . She could write her own name , and no more . ”
123320	123338	123340	123344	the sailor of former days	3917	“ Well , it was not in my heart to undeceive her when the deed was done , ”
123346	123580	123706	123706	Jane	191	“ I thought , and there was not much vanity in thinking it , that she would be happier with me . She was fairly happy , and I never would have undeceived her till the day of her death . Your child died ; she had another , and all went well . But a time came — mind me , a time always does come . A time came — it was some while after she and I and the child returned from America — when somebody she had confided her history to , told her my claim to her was a mockery , and made a jest of her belief in my right . After that she was never happy with me . She pined and pined , and socked and sighed . She said she must leave me , and then came the question of our child . Then a man advised me how to act , and I did it , for I thought it was best . I left her at Falmouth , and went off to sea . When I got to the other side of the Atlantic there was a storm , and it was supposed that a lot of us , including myself , had been washed overboard . I got ashore at Newfoundland , and then I asked myself what I should do . “
123712	123713	123706	123706	Jane	191	” “
123717	123722	123724	123724	you	3926	” said Henchard doggedly . “
123729	123746	123724	123724	you	3926	” The sailor started up , and took an enervated pace or two down the room . “
123749	123758	123765	123765	my	0	” he said , in a low voice . “
123770	123793	123796	123796	she	3920	” Henchard , without answering , shook his head as if that were rather a question for Newson himself than for him . “
123799	123804	123796	123796	she	3920	” the traveller inquired . “
123809	123819	123822	123822	she	3920	” said Henchard , in the same stolid tones . “
123825	123826	123822	123822	she	3920	” “
123833	123858	123882	123882	I	0	” replied the other without hesitation . The sailor continued standing . Henchard never looked up from the floor . At last Newson said : “
123889	124336	124590	124590	father	4491	” Henchard heard the retreating footsteps of Newson upon the sanded floor , the mechanical lifting of the latch , the slow opening and closing of the door that was natural to a baulked or dejected man ; but he did not turn his head . Newson 's shadow passed the window . He was gone . Then Henchard , scarcely believing the evidence of his senses , rose from his seat amazed at what he had done . It had been the impulse of a moment . The regard he had lately acquired for Elizabeth , the new - sprung hope of his loneliness that she would be to him a daughter of whom he could feel as proud as of the actual daughter she still believed herself to be , had been stimulated by the unexpected coming of Newson to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her ; so that the sudden prospect of her loss had caused him to speak mad lies like a child , in pure mockery of consequences . He had expected questions to close in round him , and unmask his fabrication in five minutes ; yet such questioning had not come . But surely they would come ; Newson 's departure could be but momentary ; he would learn all by inquiries in the town ; and return to curse him , and carry his last treasure away ! He hastily put on his hat , and went out in the direction that Newson had taken . Newson 's back was soon visible up the road , crossing Bull - stake . Henchard followed , and saw his visitor stop at the King 's Arms , where the morning coach which had brought him waited half - an - hour for another coach which crossed there . The coach Newson had come by was now about to move again . Newson mounted , his luggage was put in , and in a few minutes the vehicle disappeared with him . He had not so much as turned his head . It was an act of simple faith in Henchard 's words — faith so simple as to be almost sublime . The young sailor who had taken Susan Henchard on the spur of the moment and on the faith of a glance at her face , more than twenty years before , was still living and acting under the form of the grizzled traveller who had taken Henchard 's words on trust so absolute as to shame him as he stood . Was Elizabeth - Jane to remain his by virtue of this hardy invention of a moment ? “
124342	124588	124590	124590	father	4491	” said he . Newson might converse with his fellow - travellers , some of whom might be Casterbridge people ; and the trick would be discovered . This probability threw Henchard into a defensive attitude , and instead of considering how best to right the wrong , and acquaint Elizabeth 's father with the truth at once , he bethought himself of ways to keep the position he had accidentally won . Towards the young woman herself his affection grew more jealously strong with each new hazard to which his claim to her was exposed . He watched the distant highway expecting to see Newson return on foot , enlightened and indignant , to claim his child . But no figure appeared . Possibly he had spoken to nobody on the coach , but buried his grief in his own heart . His grief ! — what was it , after all , to that which he , Henchard , would feel at the loss of her ? Newson 's affection cooled by years , could not equal his who had been constantly in her presence . And thus his jealous soul speciously argued to excuse the separation of father and child . He returned to the house half expecting that she would have vanished . No ; there she was — just coming out from the inner room , the marks of sleep upon her eyelids , and exhibiting a generally refreshed air . “
124592	124597	124659	124659	I	0	” she said smiling . “
124657	124658	124723	124723	Father	202	” “
124669	124722	124723	124723	Father	202	” he said , taking her hand with anxious proprietorship — an act which gave her a pleasant surprise . They sat down to breakfast , and Elizabeth - Jane 's thoughts reverted to Lucetta . Their sadness added charm to a countenance whose beauty had ever lain in its meditative soberness . “
124725	124740	124766	124766	I	0	” she said , as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread meal , “
124764	124765	124766	124766	I	0	” “
124772	124776	124799	124799	You	0	” he replied . “
124797	124798	124812	124812	child	562	” “
124808	124809	124853	124853	you	0	” “
124849	124850	124978	124978	her	3935	” “
124869	124974	125846	125846	father	4491	” Henchard signified dubiousness . Though he had so lately hoped that Elizabeth - Jane might again live in his house as daughter , he would not ask her to do so now . Newson might return at any moment , and what Elizabeth would think of him for his deception it were best to bear apart from her . When they had breakfasted his stepdaughter still lingered , till the moment arrived at which Henchard was accustomed to go to his daily work . Then she arose , and with assurance of coming again soon went up the hill in the morning sunlight . “
125022	125845	125863	125863	I	0	” This reflection , constantly repeated by Henchard to himself , accompanied him everywhere through the day . His mood was no longer that of the rebellious , ironical , reckless misadventurer ; but the leaden gloom of one who has lost all that can make life interesting , or even tolerable . There would remain nobody for him to be proud of , nobody to fortify him ; for Elizabeth - Jane would soon be but as a stranger , and worse . Susan , Farfrae , Lucetta , Elizabeth — all had gone from him , one after one , either by his fault or by his misfortune . In place of them he had no interest , hobby , or desire . If he could have summoned music to his aid his existence might even now have been borne ; for with Henchard music was of regal power . The merest trumpet or organ tone was enough to move him , and high harmonies transubstantiated him . But hard fate had ordained that he should be unable to call up this Divine spirit in his need . The whole land ahead of him was as darkness itself ; there was nothing to come , nothing to wait for . Yet in the natural course of life he might possibly have to linger on earth another thirty or forty years — scoffed at ; at best pitied . The thought of it was unendurable . To the east of Casterbridge lay moors and meadows through which much water flowed . The wanderer in this direction who should stand still for a few moments on a quiet night , might hear singular symphonies from these waters , as from a lampless orchestra , all playing in their sundry tones from near and far parts of the moor . At a hole in a rotten weir they executed a recitative ; where a tributary brook fell over a stone breastwork they trilled cheerily ; under an arch they performed a metallic cymballing , and at Durnover Hole they hissed . The spot at which their instrumentation rose loudest was a place called Ten Hatches , whence during high springs there proceeded a very fugue of sounds . The river here was deep and strong at all times , and the hatches on this account were raised and lowered by cogs and a winch . A patch led from the second bridge over the highway ( so often mentioned ) to these Hatches , crossing the stream at their head by a narrow plank - bridge . But after night - fall human beings were seldom found going that way , the path leading only to a deep reach of the stream called Blackwater , and the passage being dangerous . Henchard , however , leaving the town by the east road , proceeded to the second , or stone bridge , and thence struck into this path of solitude , following its course beside the stream till the dark shapes of the Ten Hatches cut the sheen thrown upon the river by the weak lustre that still lingered in the west . In a second or two he stood beside the weir - hole where the water was at its deepest . He looked backwards and forwards , and no creature appeared in view . He then took off his coat and hat , and stood on the brink of the stream with his hands clasped in front of him . While his eyes were bent on the water beneath there slowly became visible a something floating in the circular pool formed by the wash of centuries ; the pool he was intending to make his death - bed . At first it was indistinct by reason of the shadow from the bank ; but it emerged thence and took shape , which was that of a human body , lying stiff and stark upon the surface of the stream . In the circular current imparted by the central flow the form was brought forward , till it passed under his eyes ; and then he perceived with a sense of horror that it was HIMSELF . Not a man somewhat resembling him , but one in all respects his counterpart , his actual double , was floating as if dead in Ten Hatches Hole . The sense of the supernatural was strong in this unhappy man , and he turned away as one might have done in the actual presence of an appalling miracle . He covered his eyes and bowed his head . Without looking again into the stream he took his coat and hat , and went slowly away . Presently he found himself by the door of his own dwelling . To his surprise Elizabeth - Jane was standing there . She came forward , spoke , called him “
125847	125862	125846	125846	father	4491	” just as before . Newson , then , had not even yet returned . “
125872	125876	125905	125905	I	0	” she said , “
125912	125933	125989	125989	I	0	” How this woman divined things ! Yet she had not divined their whole extremity . He said to her , “
125987	125988	125989	125989	I	0	” “
126000	126004	126040	126040	I	0	” she said . “
126049	126145	126040	126040	I	0	” She agreed willingly , and he took her over the highway , and by the lonely path to Ten Hatches . He walked restlessly , as if some haunting shade , unseen of her , hovered round him and troubled his glance . She would gladly have talked of Lucetta , but feared to disturb him . When they got near the weir he stood still , and asked her to go forward and look into the pool , and tell him what she saw . She went , and soon returned to him . “
126148	126152	126040	126040	I	0	” she said . “
126156	126160	126040	126040	I	0	” said Henchard , “
126165	126216	126040	126040	I	0	” She proceeded to the river brink a second time . On her return , after some delay , she told him that she saw something floating round and round there ; but what it was she could not discern . It seemed to be a bundle of old clothes . “
126222	126226	126239	126239	Father	202	” asked Henchard . “
126246	126247	126305	126305	you	0	” “
126261	126295	126305	126305	you	0	” She went back , and he could see her stoop till her head was close to the margin of the pool . She started up , and hastened back to his side . “
126298	126302	126305	126305	you	0	” said Henchard ; “
126309	126310	126305	126305	you	0	” “
126316	126317	126305	126305	you	0	” “
126330	126331	126305	126305	you	0	” “
126335	126340	126341	126341	They	3948	” she answered hastily . “
126379	126380	126408	126408	theirs	3948	” “
126417	126427	126451	126451	Father	202	” Elizabeth - Jane thought and thought of these words “
126432	126450	126454	126454	I	0	” as they slowly retraced their way to the town , and at length guessed their meaning . “
126463	126467	126502	126502	you	202	” she cried . “
126508	126509	126511	126511	you	0	” “
126516	126521	126537	126537	I	0	” he cried bitterly . “
126535	126536	126537	126537	I	0	” “
126540	126544	126562	126562	I	0	” said she . “
126560	126561	126716	126716	I	0	” “
126573	126709	126727	126727	Somebody	4446	” Thus she assured him , and arranged their plans for reunion ; and at length each went home . Then Henchard shaved for the first time during many days , and put on clean linen , and combed his hair ; and was as a man resuscitated thenceforward . The next morning the fact turned out to be as Elizabeth - Jane had stated ; the effigy was discovered by a cowherd , and that of Lucetta a little higher up in the same stream . But as little as possible was said of the matter , and the figures were privately destroyed . Despite this natural solution of the mystery Henchard no less regarded it as an intervention that the figure should have been floating there . Elizabeth - Jane heard him say , “
126731	126731	127439	127439	he	127	”
127468	127475	127863	127863	he	127	“ in his own grey style , ”
127852	127862	127880	127880	she	191	“ You have got a new muff , Elizabeth , ”
127872	127879	127943	127943	he	127	“ Yes ; I bought it , ”
127928	127942	127955	127955	she	191	“ Rather costly , I suppose , my dear , was it not ? ”
127946	127954	127955	127955	she	191	“ It was rather above my figure , ”
127959	127966	128000	128000	he	127	“ But it is not showy . ”
127967	127971	128627	128627	he	127	“ O no , ”
128636	128648	128664	128664	she	191	“ Have you seen Mr. Farfrae to - day , Elizabeth ? ”
128666	128669	128698	128698	He	127	“ No . ”
128670	128697	129045	129045	he	127	“ Oh — that 's right — that 's right .... It was only that I saw him in the street when we both were there . ”
129032	129044	129045	129045	he	127	“ Of her , too , he means to rob me ! ”
129048	129062	129113	129113	HE	127	“ But he has the right . I do not wish to interfere . ”
129116	129132	129174	129174	HE	127	“ You like walking this way , Miss Henchard — and is it not so ? ”
129154	129173	129188	129188	SHE	4019	“ O yes . I have chosen this road latterly . I have no great reason for it . ”
129177	129187	129226	129226	HE	127	“ But that may make a reason for others . ”
129194	129225	129226	129226	HE	127	“ I do n't know that . My reason , however , such as it is , is that I wish to get a glimpse of the sea every day . ”
129229	129236	129247	129247	HE	127	“ Is it a secret why ? ”
129243	129246	129247	129247	HE	127	“ Yes . ”
129261	129292	129354	129354	she	191	“ Ah , I doubt there will be any good in secrets ! A secret cast a deep shadow over my life . And well you know what it was . ”
129342	129353	129354	129354	she	191	“ Thank you for those new books , Mr. Farfrae , ”
129358	129369	129354	129354	she	191	“ I wonder if I ought to accept so many ! ”
129370	129393	129400	129400	They	4022	“ Ay ! why not ? It gives me more pleasure to get them for you , than you to have them ! ”
129394	129399	129595	129597	the young man	371	“ It can not . ”
129601	129607	129785	129785	Henchard	191	“ Dearest Elizabeth - Jane , ”
129790	129795	129917	129917	Henchard	191	“ I am content . ”
129923	129953	129975	129976	Mr. Farfrae	149	“ God forbid such a thing ! Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil , when I try so hard to keep him away ? ”
129977	129992	130199	130200	Mr. Farfrae	149	“ walked with that bankrupt Henchard 's step - daughter , of all women , ”
130202	130209	130231	130231	Coney	132	“ a pillow of the town , ”
130238	130399	131313	131313	she	191	“ No , ma'am , no wonder at all . ' Tis she that 's a stooping to he — that 's my opinion . A widow man — whose first wife was no credit to him — what is it for a young perusing woman that 's her own mistress and well liked ? But as a neat patching up of things I see much good in it . When a man have put up a tomb of best marble - stone to the other one , as he've done , and weeped his fill , and thought it all over , and said to hisself , ' T'other took me in , I knowed this one first ; she 's a sensible piece for a partner , and there 's no faithful woman in high life now ' ; — well , he may do worse than not to take her , if she 's tender - inclined . ”
131308	131312	131313	131313	she	191	“ O father ! ”
131317	131440	131441	131441	Henchard	191	“ I have had a letter — a strange one — not signed . Somebody has asked me to meet him , either on the Budmouth Road at noon today , or in the evening at Mr. Farfrae 's . He says he came to see me some time ago , but a trick was played him , so that he did not see me . I do n't understand it ; but between you and me I think Donald is at the bottom of the mystery , and that it is a relation of his who wants to pass an opinion on his choice . But I did not like to go till I had seen you . Shall I go ? ”
131445	131450	131549	131549	he	4107	“ Yes ; go . ”
131557	131569	131575	131575	she	4110	“ I am going to leave Casterbridge , Elizabeth - Jane . ”
131570	131574	131575	131575	she	4110	“ Leave Casterbridge ! ”
131578	131584	131642	131642	She	4110	“ and leave — me ? ”
131585	131641	131700	131700	she	4110	“ Yes , this little shop can be managed by you alone as well as by us both ; I do n't care about shops and streets and folk — I would rather get into the country by myself , out of sight , and follow my own ways , and leave you to yours . ”
131689	131699	131700	131700	she	4110	“ I am sorry you have decided on this , ”
131706	131738	131753	131753	Henchard	191	“ For I thought it probable — possible — that I might marry Mr. Farfrae some little time hence , and I did not know that you disapproved of the step ! ”
131739	131751	131753	131753	Henchard	191	“ I approve of anything you desire to do , Izzy , ”
131756	131796	131898	131898	she	4110	“ If I did not approve it would be no matter ! I wish to go away . My presence might make things awkward in the future , and , in short , it is best that I go . ”
131894	131897	131898	131898	she	4110	“ Then , ”
131903	131925	131944	131944	he	4113	“ you will not be able to come to my wedding ; and that is not as it ought to be . ”
131926	131943	131944	131944	he	4113	“ I do n't want to see it — I do n't want to see it ! ”
131951	132023	132032	132032	she	4115	“ but think of me sometimes in your future life — you 'll do that , Izzy ? — think of me when you are living as the wife of the richest , the foremost man in the town , and do n't let my sins , WHEN YOU KNOW THEM ALL , cause ' ee to quite forget that though I loved ' ee late I loved ' ee well . ”
132024	132031	132047	132047	Henchard	191	“ It is because of Donald ! ”
132035	132045	132060	132060	He	4116	“ I do n't forbid you to marry him , ”
132049	132059	132466	132466	he	4116	“ Promise not to quite forget me when — — ”
132450	132465	132466	132466	he	4116	“ If I had only got her with me — if I only had ! ”
132469	132513	132585	132585	Farfrae	139	“ Hard work would be nothing to me then ! But that was not to be . I — Cain — go alone as I deserve — an outcast and a vagabond . But my punishment is not greater than I can bear ! ”
132589	132613	132565	132566	Donald Farfrae	139	“ And is he gone — and did you tell him ? — I mean of the other matter — not of ours . ”
132614	132636	132717	132717	Farfrae	139	“ He is gone ; and I told him all I knew of your friend . Donald , who is he ? ”
132637	132665	132684	132684	She	4130	“ Well , well , dearie ; you will know soon about that . And Mr. Henchard will hear of it if he does not go far . ”
132666	132683	132726	132726	Farfrae	139	“ He will go far — he 's bent upon getting out of sight and sound ! ”
132742	132750	133001	133001	Newson	127	“ There he is waiting for you , ”
132982	132999	133001	133001	Newson	127	“ I 've saved you the trouble to come and meet me — ha - ha ! ”
133003	133057	133067	133067	Farfrae	149	“ The fact is that Mr. Farfrae here , he said , ' Come up and stop with me for a day or two , Captain Newson , and I 'll bring her round . ' ' Faith , ' says I , ' so I will ' ; and here I am . ”
133058	133065	133067	133067	Farfrae	149	“ Well , Henchard is gone , ”
133073	133121	133135	133135	Newson	127	“ He has done it all voluntarily , and , as I gather from Elizabeth , he has been very nice with her . I was got rather uneasy ; but all is as it should be , and we will have no more deefficulties at all . ”
133122	133133	133135	133135	Newson	127	“ Now , that 's very much as I thought , ”
133146	133216	133244	133244	Farfrae	149	“ I said to myself , ay , a hundred times , when I tried to get a peep at her unknown to herself — ' Depend upon it , ' tis best that I should live on quiet for a few days like this till something turns up for the better . ' I now know you are all right , and what can I wish for more ? ”
133217	133242	133244	133244	Farfrae	149	“ Well , Captain Newson , I will be glad to see ye here every day now , since it can do no harm , ”
133246	133315	133324	133325	Captain Newson	279	“ And what I 've been thinking is that the wedding may as well be kept under my own roof , the house being large , and you being in lodgings by yourself — so that a great deal of trouble and expense would be saved ye ? — and ' tis a convenience when a couple 's married not to hae far to go to get home ! ”
133316	133322	133324	133325	Captain Newson	279	“ With all my heart , ”
133327	133433	133436	133436	you	139	“ since , as ye say , it can do no harm , now poor Henchard 's gone ; though I would n't have done it otherwise , or put myself in his way at all ; for I 've already in my lifetime been an intruder into his family quite as far as politeness can be expected to put up with . But what do the young woman say herself about it ? Elizabeth , my child , come and hearken to what we be talking about , and not bide staring out o ' the window as if ye did n't hear . ' “
133441	133459	133436	133436	you	139	” murmured Elizabeth , still keeping up a scrutinizing gaze at some small object in the street . “
133464	133482	133637	133637	you	149	” continued Newson , turning anew to Farfrae with a face expressing thorough entry into the subject , “
133607	133608	133637	133637	you	149	” “
133624	133635	133637	133637	you	149	” said Farfrae , shaking his head with appalled gravity . “
133643	133670	133685	133685	Henchard	191	” When they had gone a little further in these particulars Newson , leaning back in his chair and smiling reflectively at the ceiling , said , “
133694	133705	133830	133830	he	291	” He expressed ignorance of what the Captain alluded to . “
133840	133850	133859	133860	the man	291	” Elizabeth now gave earnest heed to his story . “
133867	133871	133929	133929	I	0	” continued Newson . “
133936	133946	133960	133960	he	291	” Elizabeth - Jane was amazed at the intelligence . “
133954	133958	133960	133960	he	291	” she cried . “
133979	133989	134006	134006	I	0	” The father admitted that such was the case . “
133998	134005	134017	134017	I	0	” said Farfrae . Elizabeth sighed . “
134026	134083	134092	134092	he	291	” Newson , like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and strange moralities , failed to perceive the enormity of Henchard 's crime , notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom . Indeed , the attack upon the absent culprit waxing serious , he began to take Henchard 's part . “
134098	134102	134127	134127	his	291	” Newson pleaded . “
134132	134133	134127	134127	his	291	” “
134136	134149	134197	134197	he	291	” said Elizabeth - Jane firmly , in her revulsion of feeling . “
134204	134249	134197	134197	he	291	” Thus they conversed ; and there was nobody to set before Elizabeth any extenuation of the absent one 's deceit . Even had he been present Henchard might scarce have pleaded it , so little did he value himself or his good name . “
134264	134271	134197	134197	he	291	” said Newson good - naturedly . “
134279	134279	134673	134673	he	4172	”
134663	134672	134744	134744	He	4172	“ Yes , we came up that way , ”
134681	134743	134872	134872	He	4172	“ She was carrying the baby , and I was reading a ballet - sheet . Then we crossed about here — she so sad and weary , and I speaking to her hardly at all , because of my cursed pride and mortification at being poor . Then we saw the tent — that must have stood more this way . ”
134766	134871	135259	135259	he	4172	“ Here we went in , and here we sat down . I faced this way . Then I drank , and committed my crime . It must have been just on that very pixy - ring that she was standing when she said her last words to me before going off with him ; I can hear their sound now , and the sound of her sobs : ' O Mike ! I 've lived with thee all this while , and had nothing but temper . Now I 'm no more to ' ee — I 'll try my luck elsewhere . ' ”
135265	135282	135540	135540	he	4172	“ O you fool ! All this about a daughter who is no daughter of thine ! ”

135748	135779	135859	135865	a woman inside the waggon - tilt	4217	“ I trade up and down , ye know ; though , what with this travelling without horses that 's getting so common , my work will soon be done . ”
135780	135792	135859	135865	a woman inside the waggon - tilt	4217	“ Anything moving in the old place , mid I ask ? ”
135793	135800	135738	135738	he	803	“ All the same as usual . ”
135801	135826	135859	135865	a woman inside the waggon - tilt	4217	“ I 've heard that Mr. Farfrae , the late mayor , is thinking of getting married . Now is that true or not ? ”
135827	135847	135859	135865	a woman inside the waggon - tilt	4217	“ I could n't say for the life o ' me . O no , I should think not . ”
135848	135857	135859	135865	a woman inside the waggon - tilt	4217	“ But yes , John — you forget , ”
135867	135898	137523	137523	she	5219	“ What were them packages we carr'd there at the beginning o ' the week ? Surely they said a wedding was coming off soon — on Martin 's Day ? ”

138211	138216	138221	138221	she	291	“ What , Elizabeth ? ”
138226	138306	138333	138333	she	291	“ What do you say ? — Mr. Henchard ? Do n't , do n't scourge me like that ! Call me worthless old Henchard — anything — but do n't ' ee be so cold as this ! O my maid — I see you have another — a real father in my place . Then you know all ; but do n't give all your thought to him ! Do ye save a little room for me ! ”
138318	138332	138333	138333	she	291	“ I could have loved you always — I would have , gladly , ”
138336	138432	138593	138593	he	120	“ But how can I when I know you have deceived me so — so bitterly deceived me ! You persuaded me that my father was not my father — allowed me to live on in ignorance of the truth for years ; and then when he , my warm - hearted real father , came to find me , cruelly sent him away with a wicked invention of my death , which nearly broke his heart . O how can I love as I once did a man who has served us like this ! ”
138582	138592	138593	138593	he	120	“ Do n't ye distress yourself on my account , ”

But it is only for once , so forgive it . I 'll never trouble ' ee again , Elizabeth - Jane — no , not to my dying day ! Good - night . Good - bye ! ”

That farmer 's man who called on the evening of the wedding — he was seen wi ' it in his hand as he came up the street ; and ' tis thoughted that he put it down while he came in with his message , and then went away forgetting where he had left it . ”

140273	140298	140300	140302	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ If it were not so far away from Casterbridge I should say that must be poor Whittle . ' Tis just like him , ”
140304	140350	140564	140564	Farfrae	139	“ And it may be Whittle , for he 's never been to the yard these three weeks , going away without saying any word at all ; and I owing him for two days ' work , without knowing who to pay it to . ”
140549	140562	140564	140564	Farfrae	139	“ What , Abel Whittle ; is it that ye are heere ? ”
140566	140595	140564	140564	Farfrae	139	“ Ay , yes sir ! You see he was kind - like to mother when she wer here below , though ' a was rough to me . ”
140596	140603	140564	140564	Farfrae	139	“ Who are you talking of ? ”
140604	140644	140652	140654	Elizabeth - Jane	191	“ O sir — Mr. Henchet ! Did n't ye know it ? He 's just gone — about half - an - hour ago , by the sun ; for I 've got no watch to my name . ”
140645	140650	140564	140564	Farfrae	139	“ Not — dead ? ”
140656	141100	141111	141111	Farfrae	139	“ Yes , ma'am , he 's gone ! He was kind - like to mother when she wer here below , sending her the best ship - coal , and hardly any ashes from it at all ; and taties , and such - like that were very needful to her . I seed en go down street on the night of your worshipful 's wedding to the lady at yer side , and I thought he looked low and faltering . And I followed en over Grey 's Bridge , and he turned and zeed me , and said , ' You go back ! ' But I followed , and he turned again , and said , ' Do you hear , sir ? Go back ! ' But I zeed that he was low , and I followed on still . Then ' a said , ' Whittle , what do ye follow me for when I 've told ye to go back all these times ? ' And I said , ' Because , sir , I see things be bad with ' ee , and ye wer kind - like to mother if ye wer rough to me , and I would fain be kind - like to you . ' Then he walked on , and I followed ; and he never complained at me no more . We walked on like that all night ; and in the blue o ' the morning , when ' twas hardly day , I looked ahead o ' me , and I zeed that he wambled , and could hardly drag along . By the time we had got past here , but I had seen that this house was empty as I went by , and I got him to come back ; and I took down the boards from the windows , and helped him inside . ' What , Whittle , ' he said , ' and can ye really be such a poor fond fool as to care for such a wretch as I ! ' Then I went on further , and some neighbourly woodmen lent me a bed , and a chair , and a few other traps , and we brought 'em here , and made him as comfortable as we could . But he did n't gain strength , for you see , ma'am , he could n't eat — no appetite at all — and he got weaker ; and to - day he died . One of the neighbours have gone to get a man to measure him . ”
141101	141109	141143	141144	Abel Whittle	171	“ Dear me — is that so ! ”
141121	141141	141143	141144	Abel Whittle	171	“ Upon the head of his bed he pinned a piece of paper , with some writing upon it , ”
141146	141179	141211	141212	MICHAEL HENCHARD	120	“ But not being a man o ' letters , I ca n't read writing ; so I do n't know what it is . I can get it and show ye . ”
141215	141237	141211	141212	MICHAEL HENCHARD	120	“ That Elizabeth - Jane Farfrae be not told of my death , or made to grieve on account of me . “

141354	141393	None	None	None	None	“ what bitterness lies there ! O I would not have minded so much if it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting ! ... But there 's no altering — so it must be . ”
