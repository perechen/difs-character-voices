1109	1112	1102	1104	the Miss Farringdons	96	" getting on "
1369	1382	1357	1357	Elisabeth	102	" Oh ! Cousin Maria , I do wish I was pretty ! "
1435	1467	1519	1519	she	102	" That is a vain wish , my child . Favour is deceitful and beauty is vain ; and the Lord looketh on the heart and not on the outward appearance . "
1468	1478	1480	1480	Elisabeth	102	" But I was n't thinking of the Lord , "
1482	1506	1480	1480	Elisabeth	102	" I was thinking of other people ; and they love you much more if you are pretty than if you are n't . "
1507	1513	1519	1519	she	102	" That is not so , "
1527	1562	1519	1519	she	102	" if you serve God and do your duty to your neighbour , you will find plenty of people ready to love you ; and especially if you carry yourself well and never stoop . "

1933	1940	1941	1942	Miss Anne	108	" Have you noticed , sister , "
1948	1958	1941	1942	Miss Anne	108	" how much more thoughtful dear Elisabeth is growing ? "
1973	2023	1941	1942	Miss Anne	108	" She used to be somewhat careless in letting the fires go out , and so giving the servants the trouble to relight them ; but now she is always going round the rooms to see if more coal is required , without my ever having to remind her . "
2024	2103	2104	2105	Miss Farringdon	102	" It is so , and I rejoice . Carelessness in domestic matters is a grave fault in a young girl , and I am pleased that Elisabeth has outgrown her habit of wool - gathering , and of letting the fire go out under her very nose without noticing it . It is a source of thanksgiving to me that the child is so much more thoughtful and considerate in this matter than she used to be . "

5182	5189	5191	5191	Elisabeth	102	" Do you hear that noise ? "
5207	5217	5191	5191	Elisabeth	102	" that 's Mrs. Bateson 's pig being killed . "
5218	5222	5224	5224	Christopher	121	" Hear it?—rather , "
5234	5242	5243	5243	Elisabeth	102	" Let 's go and see it , "
5250	5290	5246	5246	Christopher	121	" Well , you are a horrid girl ! Nothing would induce me to go , or to let you go either ; but I 'm surprised at your being so horrid as to wish for such a thing . "
5291	5298	5299	5299	Elisabeth	102	" It is n't really horridness , "
5303	5331	5299	5299	Elisabeth	102	" it is interest . I 'm so frightfully interested in things ; and I want to see everything , just to know what it looks like . "
5332	5358	5246	5246	Christopher	121	" Well , I call it horrid . And , what 's more , if you saw it , it would make you feel ill . "
5359	5366	5299	5299	Elisabeth	102	" No ; it would n't . "
5367	5373	5375	5375	Christopher	121	" Then it ought to , "
5398	5405	5406	5406	she	102	" Nothing makes me feel ill , "
5410	5421	5406	5406	she	102	" not even an accident or an after - meeting . "
5467	5469	5464	5464	He	121	" unmanly "
5474	5484	5485	5485	he	121	" Well , you are a rum little cove ! "
5488	5531	5485	5485	he	121	" Of course , I do n't want to go if you think it would be horrid of me ; but I thought we might pretend it was the execution of Mary Queen of Scots , and find it most awfully exciting . "
5532	5566	5464	5464	He	121	" How you do go on about Mary Queen of Scots ! Not long ago you were always bothering about heathen goddesses , and now you have no thought for anything but Mary . "
5567	5612	5464	5464	He	121	" Oh ! but I 'm still immensely interested in goddesses , Chris ; and I do wish , when you are doing Latin and Greek at school , you 'd find out what colour Pallas Athene 's hair was . Could n't you ? "
5613	5620	5485	5485	he	121	" No ; I could n't . "
5621	5638	5639	5639	Christopher	121	" But you might ask one of the masters . They 'd be sure to know . "
5647	5677	5639	5639	Christopher	121	" I say , you are a duffer to suppose that clever men like schoolmasters bother their heads about such rot as the colour of a woman 's hair . "
5678	5692	5697	5697	herself	102	" Of course , I know they would n't about a woman 's , "
5699	5711	5697	5697	herself	102	" but I thought perhaps they might about a goddess 's . "
5712	5762	5763	5763	Elisabeth	102	" It is the same thing . You 've no idea what tremendously clever chaps schoolmasters are — much too clever to take any interest in girls ' and women 's concerns . Besides , they are too old for that , too — they are generally quite thirty . "
5839	5855	5856	5856	she	102	" Chris , do you think it is wicked of people to fall in love ? "
5860	5872	5874	5874	Chris	125	" Not exactly wicked ; more silly , I should say , "
5877	5893	5874	5874	Chris	125	" Because if it is wicked , I shall give up reading tales about it . "
5915	5934	5909	5909	Christopher	121	" You do n't read tales that Miss Farringdon has n't said you may read , do you ? "
5935	5954	5909	5909	Christopher	121	" Yes ; lots . But I never read tales that she has said I must n't read . "
5955	5973	5909	5909	Christopher	121	" You ought n't to read any tale till you have asked her first if you may . "
5979	6018	5974	5974	Elisabeth	102	" I never thought of doing such a thing as asking her first . Oh ! Chris , you do n't really think I ought to , do you ? Because she 'd be sure to say no . "
6019	6029	6030	6030	Christopher	121	" That is exactly why you ought to ask . "
6048	6138	6045	6045	her	102	" That is you all over ! You are the most tiresome boy to have anything to do with ! You are always bothering about things being wrong , till you make them wrong . Now I hardly ever think of it ; but I ca n't go on doing things after you 've said they are wrong , because that would be wrong of me , do n't you see ? And yet it was n't a bit wrong of me before I knew . I hate you ! "
6139	6159	6030	6030	Christopher	121	" I say , Betty , I 'm awfully sorry lo have riled you ; but you asked me . "
6160	6247	6045	6045	her	102	" I did n't ask you whether I need ask Cousin Maria , stupid ! You know I did n't . I asked you whether it was wrong to fall in love , and then you went and dragged Cousin Maria in . I wish I 'd never asked you anything ; I wish I 'd never spoken to you ; I wish I 'd got somebody else to play with , and then I 'd never speak to you again as long as I live . "
6290	6344	6346	6346	Elisabeth	102	" You are the most disagreeable boy I have ever met , and I wish I could think of something to do to annoy you . I know what I 'll do ; I 'll go by myself and see Mrs. Bateson 's pig , just to show you how I hate you . "
6892	6905	6906	6906	she	102	" You are doing it beautifully , Chris — you really are ! "
6911	6950	6906	6906	she	102	" We shall be able to have a splendid sacrifice this afternoon . I 've got some feathers to offer up from the fowl cook is plucking ; and they make a much better sacrifice than waste paper . "
6951	6954	6906	6906	she	102	" Why ? "
7176	7187	7189	7189	Christopher	121	" Why do feathers make a better sacrifice than paper ? "
7207	7231	7200	7200	she	102	" Oh ! because they smell ; and it seems so much more like a real sacrifice , somehow , if it smells . "
7232	7245	7247	7247	Elisabeth	102	" I see . What ideas you do get into your head ! "
7258	7269	7270	7270	she	102	" You really have got awfully nice - coloured hair , "
7293	7346	7270	7270	she	102	" I do wish I had light hair like yours . Angels , and goddesses , and princesses , and people of that kind always have golden hair ; but only bad fairies and cruel stepmothers have nasty dark hair like me . I think it is horrid to have dark hair . "
7347	7368	7369	7369	Christopher	121	" I do n't : I like dark hair best ; and I do n't think yours is half bad . "
7398	7412	7414	7414	Elisabeth	102	" Do n't you really , Chris ? I think it is hideous , "
7438	7469	7414	7414	Elisabeth	102	" it is like that ugly brown seaweed which shows which way the wind blows — no , I mean that shows whether it is going to rain or not . "
7470	7486	7487	7487	Chris	125	" Never mind ; I 've seen lots of people with uglier hair than yours . "
7498	7513	7515	7515	Elisabeth	102	" Are n't the trees lovely when they have got all their leaves off ? "
7522	7575	7515	7515	Elisabeth	102	" I believe I like them better now than I do in summer . Now they are like the things you wish for , and in the summer they are like the things you get ; and the things you get are never half as nice as the things you wish for . "
7583	7659	7515	7515	Elisabeth	102	" I like them best with the leaves on ; but anyhow they are nicer to look at than the chimneys that we see from our house . You ca n't think how gloomy it is for your rooms to look out on nothing but smoke and chimneys and furnaces . When you go to bed at night it 's all red , and when you get up in the morning it 's all black . "
7660	7701	7515	7515	Elisabeth	102	" I should like to live in a house like that . I love the smoke and the chimneys and the furnaces — they are all so big and strong and full of life ; and they make you think . "
7702	7713	7714	7714	Elisabeth	102	" What on earth do they make you think about ? "
7721	7838	7714	7714	Elisabeth	102	" They make me think that the Black Country is a wilderness that we are all travelling through ; and over it there is always the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night , to tell us which way to go . I make up tales to myself about the people in the wilderness ; and how they watch the pillar , and how it keeps them from idling in their work , or selling bad iron , or doing anything that is horrid or mean , because it is a sign to them that God is with them , just as it used to be to the Children of Israel . "
7918	7941	7942	7942	Elisabeth	102	" And then I pretend that the people come out of the wilderness and go to live in the country over there , "
7951	7993	7942	7942	Elisabeth	102	" and I make up lovely tales about that country , and all the beautiful things there . That is what is so nice about hills : you always think there are such wonderful places on the other side of them . "
8012	8037	8007	8008	the latter	524	" Is n't it funny that you never hate people in a morning , however much you may have hated them the night before ? "
8038	8043	8007	8008	the latter	524	" Do n't you ? "
8063	8161	8162	8162	Christopher	121	" Oh ! no . Last night I hated you , and made up a story in my own mind that another really nice boy came to play with me instead of you . And I said nice things to him , and horrid things to you ; he and I played in the wood , and you had to do lessons all by yourself at school , and had nobody to play with . But when I woke up this morning I did n't care about the pretending boy any more , and I wanted you . "
8179	8193	8194	8194	he	121	" And so , I suppose , you came to look for me , "
8197	8299	8194	8194	he	121	" Not the first thing . Somehow it always makes you like a person better when you have hated them for a bit , so I liked you awfully when I woke this morning and remembered you . When you really are fond of a person , you always want to do something to please them ; so I went and told Cousin Maria that I 'd read a lot of books in the library without thinking whether I ought to or not ; but that now I wanted her to say what I might read and what I might n't . "
8314	8319	8320	8320	he	121	" Was she angry ? "
8323	8434	8320	8320	he	121	" Not a bit . That is the best of Cousin Maria — she never scolds you unless you really deserve it ; and she is very sharp at finding out whether you deserve it or not . She said that there were a lot of books in the library that were n't suitable for a little girl to read ; but that it was n't naughty of me to have read what I chose , since nobody had told me not to . And then she said it was good of me to have told her , for she should never have found it out if I had n't . "
8435	8441	8443	8443	Christopher	121	" And so it was , "
8446	8488	8443	8443	Christopher	121	" No ; it wasn't — and I told her it was n't . I told her that the goodness was yours , because it was you that made me tell . I should never have thought of it by myself . "
8489	8499	8500	8500	Elisabeth	102	" I say , you are a regular brick ! "
8504	8545	8500	8500	Elisabeth	102	" I do n't see anything brickish in saying that ; it was the truth . It was you that made me tell , you know ; and it was n't fair for me to be praised for your goodness . "
8546	8557	8559	8559	Christopher	121	" You really are awfully straight , for a girl , "
8564	8576	8559	8559	Christopher	121	" you could n't be straighter if you were a boy . "
8598	8615	8617	8617	Christopher	121	" It was really very good of you to speak to Miss Farringdon about the books , "
8619	8636	8617	8617	Christopher	121	" for I know you 'll hate having to ask permission before you read a tale . "
8637	8647	8649	8649	Elisabeth	102	" I did n't do it out of goodness , "
8650	8709	8617	8617	Christopher	121	thoughtfully—"I did it to please you ; and pleasing a person you are fond of is n't goodness . I wonder if grown - up people get to be as fond of religion as they are of one another . I expect they do ; and then they do good things just for the sake of doing good . "
8710	8716	8718	8718	Christopher	121	" Of course they do , "
8730	8734	8735	8735	she	102	" I suppose , "
8739	8759	8735	8735	she	102	" that if I were really good , religion ought to be the same to me as Cousin Anne . "
8760	8772	8617	8617	Christopher	121	" The same as Cousin Anne ! What do you mean ? "
8773	8797	8617	8617	Christopher	121	" I mean that if I were really good , religion would give me the same sort of feelings as Cousin Anne does . "
8798	8804	8735	8735	she	102	" What sort of feelings ? "
8805	8813	8617	8617	Christopher	121	" Oh ! they are lovely feelings , "
8815	8866	8735	8735	she	102	answered—"too lovely to explain . Everything is a treat if Cousin Anne is there . When she speaks , it 's just like music trickling down your back ; and when you do something that you do n't like to please her , you feel that you do like it . "
8867	8893	8735	8735	she	102	" Well , you are a rum little thing ! I should think nobody ever thought of all the queer things that you think of . "
8894	8902	8904	8904	Elisabeth	102	" Oh ! I expect everybody does , "
8924	8932	8921	8921	she	102	" Do you like me , Chris ? "
8933	8943	8944	8944	Christopher	121	" Rather ! What a foolish question to ask ! "
8987	8995	8996	8996	she	102	" How much do you like me ? "
8999	9003	8996	8996	she	102	" A lot . "
9004	9014	8996	8996	she	102	" But I want to know exactly how much . "
9015	9036	8996	8996	she	102	" Then you ca n't . Nobody can tell how much they like anybody . You do ask silly questions ! "
9037	9052	9053	9053	Elisabeth	102	" Yes ; they can . I can tell how much I like everybody , "
9056	9059	9053	9053	Elisabeth	102	" How ? "
9060	9091	8996	8996	she	102	" I have a sort of thermometer in my mind , just like the big thermometer in the hall ; and I measure how much I like people by that . "
9092	9102	9103	9103	he	550	" How much do you like your Cousin Anne ? "
9106	9112	9114	9114	Elisabeth	102	" Ninety - six degrees , "
9117	9123	9114	9114	Elisabeth	102	" And your Cousin Maria ? "
9124	9127	8996	8996	she	102	" Sixty . "
9128	9133	8996	8996	she	102	" And Mrs. Bateson ? "
9134	9139	8996	8996	she	102	" Fifty - four . "
9147	9162	9164	9164	Christopher	121	" I say , how — how — how much do you like me ? "
9170	9175	9177	9177	Elisabeth	102	" Sixty - two , "
9235	9252	9254	9254	Elisabeth	102	" Cousin Maria , please may I go to tea at Mrs. Bateson 's with Christopher ? "
9292	9294	9287	9287	She	102	" Chris "
9335	9353	9322	9322	she	102	" Mrs. Bateson has killed her pig , and there will be pork - pies for tea . "
9366	9428	9354	9355	Miss Farringdon	102	" Yes , my child ; I see no reason why you should not . Kezia Bateson is a God - fearing woman , and her husband has worked at the Osierfield for forty years . I have the greatest respect for Caleb Bateson ; he is a worthy man and a good Methodist , as his father was before him . "
9429	9443	9322	9322	she	102	" He is a very ignorant man : he says Penny - lope . "
9444	9450	9322	9322	she	102	" Says what , Elisabeth ? "
9451	9507	9354	9355	Miss Farringdon	102	" Penny - lope . I was showing him a book the other day about Penelope — the woman with the web , you know — and he called her Penny - lope . I did n't like to correct him , but I said Penelope afterward as often and as loud as I could . "
9508	9523	9524	9525	The child	2988	" That was very ill - bred of you . Come here , Elisabeth . "
9576	9597	9869	9870	Miss Farringdon	102	" What have I taught you are the two chief ends at which every woman should aim , my child ? "
9598	9609	9611	9611	Elisabeth	102	" To be first a Christian and then a gentlewoman , "
9614	9626	9611	9611	Elisabeth	102	" And how does a true gentlewoman show her good breeding ? "
9627	9643	9644	9644	Elisabeth	102	" By never doing or saying anything that could make any one else feel uncomfortable , "
9648	9675	9644	9644	Elisabeth	102	" Then do you think that to display your own knowledge by showing up another person 's ignorance would make that person feel comfortable , Elisabeth ? "
9676	9682	9611	9611	Elisabeth	102	" No , Cousin Maria . "
9683	9716	9717	9717	Elisabeth	102	" Knowledge is not good breeding , remember ; it is a far less important matter . A true gentlewoman may be ignorant ; but a true gentlewoman will never be inconsiderate . "
9722	9726	9717	9717	Elisabeth	102	" I see . "
9727	9767	9611	9611	Elisabeth	102	" If you keep your thoughts fixed upon the people to whom you are talking , and never upon yourself , you will always have good manners , my child . Endeavour to interest and not to impress them . "
9768	9782	9611	9611	Elisabeth	102	" You mean I must talk about their things and not about mine ? "
9783	9858	9717	9717	Elisabeth	102	" More than that . Make the most of any common ground between yourself and them ; make the least of any difference between yourself and them ; and , above all , keep strenuously out of sight any real or fancied superiority you may possess over them . I always think that Saint Paul 's saying , ' To the weak became I as weak , ' was the perfection of good manners . "
9859	9868	9869	9870	Miss Farringdon	102	" I do n't think I quite understand . "
9875	9979	9980	9980	Elisabeth	102	" Then listen to this story . There was once a common soldier who raised himself from the ranks and earned a commission . He was naturally very nervous the first night he dined at the officers ' mess , as he had never dined with gentlemen before , and he was afraid of making some mistake . It happened that the wine was served while the soup was yet on the table , and with the wine the ice . The poor man did not know what the ice was for , so took a lump and put it in his soup . "
9983	9996	9980	9980	Elisabeth	102	" The younger officers began to giggle , as you are doing , "
10001	10045	9997	9998	Miss Farringdon	102	" but the colonel , to whom the ice was handed next , took a lump and put it in his soup also ; and then the young officers did not want to laugh any more . The colonel was a perfect gentleman . "
10046	10052	10054	10054	Elisabeth	102	" It seems to me , "
10057	10071	10054	10054	Elisabeth	102	" that you 've got to be good before you can be polite . "
10072	10082	10084	10085	Miss Farringdon	102	" Politeness appears to be what goodness really is , "
10087	10161	10162	10162	Elisabeth	102	" and is an attitude rather than an action . Fine breeding is not the mere learning of any code of manners , any more than gracefulness is the mere learning of any kind of physical exercise . The gentleman apparently , as the Christian really , looks not on his own things , but on the things of others ; and the selfish person is always both unchristian and ill - bred . "
10172	10193	10167	10168	Miss Farringdon	102	" I should like to be a real gentlewoman , Cousin Maria ; do you think I ever shall be ? "
10194	10263	10265	10266	Miss Farringdon	102	" I think it quite possible , if you bear all these maxims in mind , and if you carry yourself properly and never stoop . I can not approve of the careless manners of the young people of to - day , who loll upon easy - chairs in the presence of their elders , and who slouch into a room with constrained familiarity and awkward ease , "
10386	10388	10390	10390	her	123	" lively "
10393	10396	10390	10390	her	123	" dull , "
10798	10809	10811	10812	the hostess	584	" I hope that you 'll all make yourselves welcome , "
10824	10838	10811	10812	the hostess	584	" Master Christopher , my dear , will you kindly ask a blessing ? "
10854	10924	10850	10851	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Well , to be sure , it is a pleasure to see you looking so tall and strong , Master Christopher , after all your schooling . I 'm not in favour of much schooling myself , as I think it hinders young folks from growing , and puts them off their vittles ; but you give the contradiction to that notion — doesn't he , Mrs. Hankey ? "
10957	10961	10955	10955	she	134	" tempting Providence . "
11167	11173	11174	11174	she	134	" You can never tell , "
11175	11212	11222	11223	the hostess	584	replied—"never ; often them that looks the best feels the worst ; and many 's the time I 've seen folks look the very picture of health just before they was took with a mortal illness . "
11213	11220	11222	11223	the hostess	584	" Ay , that 's so , "
11225	11249	11222	11223	the hostess	584	" but I think Master Christopher 's looks are the right sort ; such a nice colour as he 's got , too ! "
11250	11267	11269	11270	Mrs. Hankey	134	" That comes from him being so fair complexioned — it 's no sign of health , "
11272	11310	11269	11270	Mrs. Hankey	134	" in fact , I mistrust those fair complexions , especially in lads of his age . Why , he ought to be as brown as a berry , instead of pink and white like a girl . "
11311	11328	11330	11330	Christopher	135	" It would look hideous to have a brown face with such yellow hair as mine , "
11341	11371	11373	11374	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Master Christopher , do n't call anything that the Lord has made hideous . We must all be as He has formed us , however that may be , "
11377	11396	11373	11374	Mrs. Hankey	134	" and it is not our place to pass remarks upon what He has done for the best . "
11397	11419	11421	11421	Elisabeth	102	" But the Lord did n't make him with a brown face and yellow hair ; that 's just the point , "
11446	11457	11458	11459	Mrs. Bateson	123	" No , my love ; that 's true enough , "
11463	11546	11458	11459	Mrs. Bateson	123	" a truer word than that never was spoken . But I wish you could borrow some of Master Christopher 's roses — I do , indeed . For my part , I like to see little girls with a bit of colour in their cheeks ; it looks more cheerful - like , as you might say ; and looks go a long way with some folks , though a meek and quiet spirit is better , taking it all round . "
11547	11559	11561	11562	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Now Miss Elisabeth does look delicate , and no mistake , "
11564	11595	11561	11562	Mrs. Hankey	134	" she grows too fast for her strength , I 'll be bound ; and her poor mother died young , you know , so it is in the family . "
11761	11826	11754	11755	The hostess	584	" She is pale , Mrs. Hankey , there 's no doubt of that ; but pale folks are often the healthiest , though they may n't be the handsomest . And she is wiry , is Miss Elisabeth , though she may be thin . But is your tea to your taste , or will you take a little more cream in it ? "
11827	11885	11886	11887	Mrs. Bateson	123	" It is quite right , thank you , Mrs. Bateson ; and the pork - pie is just beautiful . What a light hand for pastry you always have ! I 'm sure I 've said over and over again that I do n't know your equal either for making pastry or for engaging in prayer . "
11896	11998	11886	11887	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I doubt if I ever made a better batch of pies than this . When they were all ready for baking , Bateson says to me , ' Kezia , ' he says , ' them pies is a regular picture — all so smooth and even - like , you ca n't tell which from t'other . ' ' Bateson , ' said I , ' I 've done my best with them ; and if only the Lord will be with them in the oven , they 'll be the best batch of pies this side Jordan . ' "
11999	12005	12007	12007	Elisabeth	102	" And so they are , "
12009	12015	12007	12007	Elisabeth	102	" they are perfectly lovely . "
12016	12039	11886	11887	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I 'm glad you fancy them , my love ; take some more , deary , it 'll do you good . "
12040	12053	12007	12007	Elisabeth	102	" No , thanks ; I 'd rather have a wig now . "
12068	12071	11886	11887	Mrs. Bateson	123	" wigs , "
12078	12087	12088	12089	Mrs. Hankey	134	" You always are fortunate in your pigs , "
12092	12138	12088	12089	Mrs. Hankey	134	" such fine hams and such beautiful roaded bacon I never see anywhere equal to yours . It 'll be a sad day for you , Mrs. Bateson , when swine fever comes into the district . I know no one as'll feel it more . "
12139	12155	12156	12157	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Now you must tell us all about your niece 's wedding , Mrs. Hankey , "
12158	12218	12088	12089	Mrs. Hankey	134	said—"her that was married last week . My word alive , but your sister is wonderful fortunate in settling her daughters ! That 's what I call a well - brought - up family , and no mistake . Five daughters , and each one found peace and a pious husband before she was five - and - twenty . "
12219	12228	12230	12231	Mrs. Hankey	134	" The one before last married a Churchman , "
12257	12274	12088	12089	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Well , to be sure ! Still , he may make her a good husband . "
12275	12390	12088	12089	Mrs. Hankey	134	" He may or he may not ; you never can tell . It seems to me that husbands are like new boots — you ca n't tell where they 're going to pinch you till it 's too late to change 'em . And as for creaking , why , the boots that are quietest in the shop are just the ones that fairly disgrace you when you come into chapel late on a Sunday morning , and think to slip in quietly during the first prayer ; and it is pretty much the same with husbands — those that are the meekest in the wooing are the most masterful to live with . "
12391	12403	12405	12406	Mrs. Bateson	123	" What was the name of the Churchman your niece married ? "
12408	12412	12405	12406	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I forget . "
12413	12472	12088	12089	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Wilkins — Tom Wilkins . He is n't a bad fellow in some respects — he is steady and sober , and never keeps back a farthing of his wages for himself ; but his views are something dreadful . I can not stand them at any price , and so I 'm forever telling his wife . "
12473	12485	12088	12089	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Dear me ! That 's sad news , Mrs. Hankey . "
12486	12541	12405	12406	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Would you believe it , he do n't hold with the good old Methodist habit of telling out loud what the Lord has done for your soul ? He says religion should be acted up to and not talked about ; but , for my part , I ca n't abide such closeness . "
12542	12546	12548	12549	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Nor I , "
12552	12600	12548	12549	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I do n't approve of treating the Lord like a poor relation , as some folks seem to do . They 'll go to His house and they 'll give Him their money ; but they 're fairly ashamed of mentioning His Name in decent company . "
12601	12752	12405	12406	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Just so ; and that 's Tom Wilkins to the life . He 's a good husband and a regular church - goer ; but as for the word that edifieth , you might as well look for it from a naked savage as from him . Many a time have I said to his wife , ' Tom may be a kind husband in the time of prosperity , as I make no doubt he is — there 's plenty of that sort in the world ; but you wait till the days of adversity come , and I doubt that then you 'll be wishing you 'd not been in such a hurry to get married , but had waited till you had got a good Methodist ! ' And so she will , I 'll be bound ; and the sooner she knows it the better . "
12771	12789	12768	12768	she	123	" How did the last daughter 's wedding go off ? She married a Methodist , surely ? "
12790	12952	12405	12406	Mrs. Bateson	123	" She did , Mrs. Bateson ; and a better match no mother could wish for her daughter , not even a duchess born ; he 's a chapel - steward and a master - painter , and has six men under him . There he is , driving to work and carrying his own ladders in his own cart , like a lord , as you may say , by day ; and there he is on a Thursday evening , letting and reletting the pews and sittings after service , like a real gentleman . As I said to my sister , I only hope he may be spared to make Susan a good husband ; but when a man is a chapel - steward at thirty - four , and drives his own cart , you begin to think that he is too good for this world , and that he is almost ripe for a better one . "
12953	12964	12768	12768	she	123	" You do indeed ; there 's no denying that . "
12965	13089	12768	12768	she	123	" But the wedding was beautiful : I never saw its equal — never ; and as for the prayer that the minister offered up at the end of the service , I only wish you 'd been there to hear it , Mrs. Bateson , it was so interesting and instructive . Such a lot of information in it about love and marriage and the like as I 'd never heard before ; and when he referred to the bridegroom 's first wife , and drew a picture of how she 'd be waiting to welcome them both , when the time came , on the further shore — upon my word , there was n't a dry eye in the chapel ! "
13103	13110	13112	13112	Elisabeth	102	" But what did Susan say ? "
13118	13135	13112	13112	Elisabeth	102	" I expect she did n't want another wife to welcome them on the further shore . "
13136	13152	13154	13154	Susan	142	" Oh ! Miss Elisabeth , what a naughty , selfish little girl you are ! "
13161	13233	13234	13234	Elisabeth	102	" What would Miss Farringdon think if she heard you ? Why , you do n't suppose , surely , that when folks get to heaven they 'll be so greedy and grasping that they 'll want to keep everything to themselves , do you ? My niece is a good girl and a member of society , and she was as pleased as anybody at the minister 's beautiful prayer . "
13241	13248	13250	13251	Mrs. Bateson	123	" How is your sister herself ? "
13253	13281	13282	13283	Mrs. Hankey	134	" I expect she 's a bit upset now that the fuss is all over , and she has n't a daughter left to bless herself with . "
13287	13370	13282	13283	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Well , she did seem rather low - spirited when all the mess was cleared up , and Susan had gone off to her own home ; but I says to her , ' Never mind , Sarah , and do n't you worry yourself ; now that the weddings are over , the funerals will soon begin . ' You see , you must cheer folks up a bit , Mrs. Bateson , when they 're feeling out of sorts . "
13371	13376	13378	13382	the lady of the house	595	" You must indeed , "
13397	13427	13378	13382	the lady of the house	595	" it is dull without daughters when you 've once got accustomed to 'em , daughters being a sight more comfortable and convenient than sons , to my mind . "
13428	13504	13282	13283	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Well , you see , daughters you can teach to know theirselves , and sons ; you ca n't . Though even daughters can never rest till they 've got married , more 's the pity . If they knowed as much about men as I do , they 'd be thanking the Lord that He 'd created them single , instead of forever fidgeting to change the state to which they were born . "
13505	13515	13517	13518	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Well , I holds with folks getting married , "
13520	13551	13517	13518	Mrs. Bateson	123	" it gives 'em something to think about between Sunday 's sermon and Thursday 's baking ; and if folks have nothing to think about , they think about mischief . "
13552	13565	13282	13283	Mrs. Hankey	134	" That 's true , especially if they happen to be men . "
13566	13578	13580	13580	Elisabeth	102	" Why do men think about mischief more than women do ? "
13594	13615	13617	13618	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Because , my dear , the Lord made 'em so , and it is not for us to complain , "
13655	13674	13617	13618	Mrs. Hankey	134	" They 've no sense , men have n't ; that 's what is the matter with them . "
13675	13686	13688	13689	her hostess	600	" You never spoke a truer word , Mrs. Hankey , "
13691	13783	13688	13689	her hostess	600	" the very best of them do n't properly know the difference between their souls and their stomachs ; and they fancy that they are a - wrestling with their doubts , when really it is their dinners that are a - wrestling with them . Now take Bateson hisself , and a kinder husband or a better Methodist never drew breath ; yet so sure as he touches a bit of pork , he begins to worn hisself about the doctrine of Election till there 's no living with him . "
13784	13797	13799	13800	Mrs. Hankey	134	" That 's a man all over , to the very life , "
13803	13823	13799	13800	Mrs. Hankey	134	" and he never has the sense to see what 's wrong with him , I 'll be bound . "
13824	13899	13688	13689	her hostess	600	" Not he — he would n't be a man if he had . And then he 'll sit in the front parlour and engage in prayer for hours at a time , till I says to him , ' Bateson , ' says I , ' I 'd be ashamed to go troubling the Lord with a prayer when a pinch o ' carbonate o ' soda would set things straight again . ' "
13900	13931	13688	13689	her hostess	600	" And quite right , Mrs. Bateson ; it 's often a wonder to me that the Lord has patience with men , seeing that their own wives have n't . "
13932	14040	14041	14042	Mrs. Hankey	134	" And to me , too . Now Bateson has been going on like this for thirty years or more ; yet if there 's roast pork on the table , and I say a word to put him off it , he 's that hurt as never was . Why , I 'm only too glad to see him enjoying his food if no harm comes of it ; but it 's dreary work seeing your husband in the Slough of Despond , especially when it 's your business to drag him out again , and most especially when you particularly warned him against going in . "
14045	14157	14041	14042	Mrs. Hankey	134	" The Bible says true when it tells us that men are born to give trouble as the sparks fly upward ; and it is a funny Providence , to my mind , as ordains for women to be so bothered with 'em . At my niece 's wedding , as we were just speaking about , ' Susan , ' I says , ' I wish you happiness ; and I only hope you wo n't live to regret your marriage as I have done mine . ' For my part , I ca n't see what girls want with husbands at all ; they are far better without them . "
14158	14165	14167	14168	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Not they , Mrs. Hankey , "
14171	14261	14167	14168	Mrs. Bateson	123	" any sort of a husband is better than none , to my mind . Life is made up of naughts and crosses ; and the folks that get the crosses are better off than those that get the naughts , though that husbands are crosses I ca n't pretend to deny ; but I have n't patience with single women , I haven't — they have nothing to occupy their minds , and so they get to talking about their health and such - like fal - lals . "
14262	14271	14273	14274	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Saint Paul did n't hold with you , "
14282	14301	14273	14274	Mrs. Hankey	134	" he thought that the unmarried women minded the things of the Lord better than the married ones . "
14302	14396	14167	14168	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Saint Paul did n't know much about the subject , and how could he be expected to , being only a bachelor himself , poor soul ? But if he 'd had a wife , she 'd soon have told him what the unmarried women were thinking about ; and it would n't have been about the Lord , I 'll be bound . Now take Jemima Stubbs ; does she mind the things of the Lord more than you and I do , Mrs. Hankey , I should like to know ? "
14397	14411	14167	14168	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I ca n't say ; it is not for us to judge . "
14412	14523	14273	14274	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Not she ! Why , she 's always worrying about that poor little brother of hers , what 's lame . I often wish that the Lord would think on him and take him , for he 's a sore burden on Jemima , he is . If you 're a woman you are bound to work for some man or another , and to see to his food and to bear with his tantrums ; and , for my part , I 'd rather do it for a husband than for a father or a brother . There 's more credit in it , as you might say . "
14524	14533	14167	14168	Mrs. Bateson	123	" There 's something in that , maybe . "
14534	14633	14167	14168	Mrs. Bateson	123	" And after all , in spite of the botheration he gives , there 's something very cheerful in having a man about the house . They keep you alive , do men . The last time I saw Jemima Stubbs she was as low as low could be . ' Jemima , ' I says , ' you are out of spirits . ' ' Mrs. Bateson , ' says she , ' I am that . I wish I was either in love or in the cemetery , and I do n't much mind which . ' "
14634	14639	14641	14641	Elisabeth	102	" Did she cry ? "
14782	14787	14789	14790	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Cry , lovey ? "
14792	14806	14789	14790	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I should just think she did — fit to break her heart . "
14828	14839	14840	14840	she	123	" I shall go and see her to - morrow , "
14843	14865	14840	14840	she	123	" and take her something nice for her little brother . What do you think he would like , Mrs. Bateson ? "
14866	14882	14884	14885	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Bless the child , she is one of the Good Shepherd 's own lambs ! "
14897	14914	14915	14915	she	123	" It is the sweetest flowers that are the readiest for transplanting to the Better Land , "
14935	14941	14942	14942	she	102	" What would he like ? "
14943	14956	14890	14890	her	123	persisted—"a new toy , or a book , or jam and cake ? "
14957	14998	14999	14999	Elisabeth	102	" I should think a book , lovey ; he 's fair set on books , is Johnnie Stubbs ; and if you 'd read a bit to him yourself , it would be a fine treat for the lad . "
15006	15045	14999	14999	Elisabeth	102	" I 'll go the first thing to - morrow morning , and read him my favourite chapter out of The Fairchild Family ; and then I 'll teach him some nice games to play all by himself . "
15046	15054	15056	15057	Mrs. Bateson	123	" That 's a dear young lady ! "
15065	15076	15056	15057	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Do you think Jemima will cry when I go ? "
15077	15100	14890	14890	her	123	" No , lovey ; she would n't so far forget herself as to bother the gentry with her troubles , surely . "
15101	15175	15182	15183	Mrs. Bateson	123	" But I should n't be bothered ; I should be too sorry for her . I always am frightfully interested in people who are unhappy — much more interested than in people who are happy ; and I always love everybody when I 've seen them cry . It is so easy to be happy , and so dull . But why does n't Jemima fall in love if she wants to ? "
15176	15180	15182	15183	Mrs. Bateson	123	" There now ! "
15196	15214	15182	15183	Mrs. Bateson	123	" What a clever child she is ! I 'm sure I do n't know , dearie . "
15215	15229	15231	15231	Elisabeth	102	" It is a pity that she has n't got a Cousin Anne , "
15239	15254	15233	15233	her	102	" When you 've got a Cousin Anne , it makes everything so lovely . "
15255	15267	15269	15270	Mrs. Bateson	123	" And so it does , dearie — so it does , "
15299	15317	15296	15296	Christopher	135	" Old Mother Bateson is n't a bad sort ; but I ca n't stand Mother Hankey . "
15318	15322	15233	15233	her	102	" Why not ? "
15323	15330	15331	15331	He	135	" She says such horrid things . "
15345	15379	15339	15339	her	134	" Not horrid , Chris . She is rather stupid sometimes , and does n't know when things are funny ; but she never means to be really horrid , I am sure . "
15380	15391	15393	15393	Christopher	135	" Well , I think she is an old cat , "
15395	15409	15411	15411	Elisabeth	102	" The only thing I do n't like about her is her gloves , "
15414	15440	15411	15411	Elisabeth	102	" they are so old they smell of biscuit . Is n't it funny that old gloves always smell of biscuit . I wonder why ? "
15441	15447	15449	15449	Christopher	135	" I think they do , "
15451	15485	15449	15449	Christopher	135	" but nobody except you would ever have thought of saying it . You have a knack of saying what everybody else is thinking ; and that is what makes you so amusing . "
15486	15510	15411	15411	Elisabeth	102	" I 'm glad you think I 'm amusing ; but I ca n't see much funniness in just saying what is true . "
15511	15531	15533	15533	Christopher	135	" Well , I ca n't explain why it is funny ; but you really are simply killing sometimes , "
15829	15849	15818	15818	he	135	" I say , I wish you would n't tire yourself with going to read to that Stubbs brat . "
15850	15886	15818	15818	he	135	" Tire myself ? What rubbish ! nothing can tire me . I never felt tired in my life ; but I should n't mind it just once , to see what it feels like . "
15887	15928	15818	15818	he	135	" It feels distinctly unpleasant , I can tell you . But I really do wish you 'd take more care of yourself , or else you 'll get ill , or have headaches or something — you will indeed . "
15929	15973	15818	15818	he	135	" No , I sha n't ; I never had a headache . That 's another of the things that I do n't know what they feel like ; and yet I want to know what everything feels like — even disagreeable things . "
15974	15985	15987	15987	Christopher	135	" You 'll know fast enough , I 'm afraid , "
15989	16039	15987	15987	Christopher	135	" but even if it does n't tire you , you would enjoy playing in the garden more than reading to Johnnie Stubbs — you know you would ; and I can go and read to the little chap , if you are set on his being read to . "
16040	16073	15818	15818	he	135	" But you would much rather play in the garden than read to him ; and especially as it is your holidays , and your own reading - time will soon begin . "
16074	16130	15818	15818	he	135	" Oh ! I do n't matter . Never bother your head about me ; remember I 'm all right as long as you are ; and that as long as you 're jolly , I 'm bound to have a good time . But it riles me to see you worrying and overdoing yourself . "
16131	16187	15818	15818	he	135	" You do n't understand , Chris ; you really are awfully stupid about understanding things . I do n't go to see Jemima and Johnnie because I hate going , and yet think I ought ; I go because I am so sorry for them both that my sorriness makes me like to go . "
16337	16341	16342	16342	Elisabeth	102	" You see , "
16345	16412	16342	16342	Elisabeth	102	" there is nothing that makes you so fond of people as being sorry for them . The people that are strong and happy do n't want your fondness , so it is no use giving it to them . It is the weak , unhappy people that want you to love them , and so it is the weak , unhappy people that you love . "
16413	16419	16421	16421	Christopher	135	" But I do n't , "
16432	16488	16421	16421	Christopher	135	" when I like people , I should like them just the same as if they went about yelling Te Deums at the top of their voices ; and when I do n't like them , it would n't make me like them to see them dressed from head to foot in sackcloth and ashes . "
16489	16503	16342	16342	Elisabeth	102	" Oh ! that 's a stupid way of liking , I think . "
16504	16516	16342	16342	Elisabeth	102	" It may be stupid , but it 's my way . "
16517	16532	16534	16534	Elisabeth	102	" Do n't you like me better when I cry than when I laugh ? "
16544	16588	16534	16534	Elisabeth	102	" Good gracious , no ! I always like you the same ; but I 'd much rather you laughed than cried — it is so much jollier for you ; in fact , it makes me positively wretched to see you cry . "
16589	16595	16596	16596	Elisabeth	102	" It always vexes me , "
16600	16628	16596	16596	Elisabeth	102	" to read about tournaments , because I think it was so horrid of the Queen of Beauty to give the prize to the knight who won . "
16635	16648	16629	16629	Christopher	135	" What nonsense ! Who else could she have given it to ? "
16649	16813	16534	16534	Elisabeth	102	" Why , to the knight who lost , of course . I often make up a tale to myself that I am the Queen of Beauty at a tournament ; and when the victorious knight rides up to me with his visor raised , I just laugh at him , and say , ' You can have the fame and the glory and the cheers of the crowd ; that 's quite enough for you ! ' And then I go down from my daïs , right into the arena where the unhorsed knight is lying wounded , and take off his helmet , and lay his head on my lap , and say , ' You shall have the prize , because you have got nothing else ! ' So then that knight becomes my knight , and always wears my colours ; and that makes up to him for having been beaten at the tournament , do n't you see ? "
16814	16846	16848	16848	Christopher	135	" It would have been a rotten sort of tournament that was carried on in that fashion ; and your prize would have been no better than a booby - prize , "
16850	16878	16848	16848	Christopher	135	" How silly you are ! I 'm glad I 'm not a boy ; I would n't have been as stupid as a boy for anything ! "
16879	16909	16534	16534	Elisabeth	102	" Do n't be so cross ! You must see that the knight who wins is the best knight ; chaps that are beaten are not up to much . "
16910	16935	16936	16937	Whereupon Elisabeth	149	" Well , they are the sort I like best ; and if you had any sense you 'd like them best , too . "
17231	17244	17245	17245	she	102	" It is no use trying to make me interested in things , "
17262	17285	17245	17245	she	102	" I shall never be interested in anything again — never . Everything is different now that Cousin Anne is gone away . "
17286	17291	17293	17293	Christopher	135	" Not quite everything , "
17296	17355	17293	17293	Christopher	135	" Yes ; everything . Why , the very trees do n't look the same as they used to look , and the view is n't a bit what it used to be when she was here . All the ordinary things seem queer and altered , just as they do when you see them in a dream . "
17356	17361	17245	17245	she	102	" Poor little girl ! "
17362	17455	17293	17293	Christopher	135	" And now it does n't seem worth while for anything to look pretty . I used to love the sunsets , but now I hate them . What is the good of their being so beautiful and filling the sky with red and gold , if she is n't here to see them ? And what is the good of trying to be good and clever if she is n't here to be pleased with me ? Oh dear ! oh dear ! Nothing will ever be any good any more . "
17475	17517	17456	17456	Christopher	135	" I say , I wish you would n't fret so ; it 's more than I can stand to see you so wretched . Is n't there anything that I can do to make it up to you , somehow ? "
17518	17550	17554	17554	Elisabeth	102	" No ; nothing . Nothing will ever comfort me any more ; and how could a great , stupid boy like you make up to me for having lost her ? "
17563	17591	17554	17554	Elisabeth	102	" Well , anyway , I am as fond of you as she was , for nobody could be fonder of anybody than I am of you . "
17592	17633	17554	17554	Elisabeth	102	" That does n't help . I do n't miss her so because she loved me , but because I loved her ; and I shall never , never love any one else as much as long as I live . "
17634	17644	17646	17646	Christopher	135	" Oh yes , you will , I expect , "
17659	17675	17646	17646	Christopher	135	" No — I sha n't ; and I should hate myself if I did . "
18662	18666	18658	18672	certain women to whom " the trivial round " and " the common task "	3316	" the trivial round "
18668	18672	18658	18672	certain women to whom " the trivial round " and " the common task "	3316	" the common task "
18828	18832	18814	18814	she	102	" Dear Lady , "
18842	18845	18846	18846	herself	102	" Dear Lady "
19176	19188	19190	19190	Felicia	154	" I shall never go to balls when I leave school , "
19220	19233	19190	19190	Felicia	154	" I do n't think it is right to go to balls . "
19234	19259	19190	19190	Felicia	154	" Why not ? There can be no harm in enjoying oneself , and I do n't believe that God ever thinks there is . "
19260	19312	19190	19190	Felicia	154	" Not in enjoying oneself in a certain way ; but the line between religious people and worldly people ought to be clearly marked . I think that dancing is a regular worldly amusement , and that good people should openly show their disapproval of it by not joining in it . "
19313	19322	19323	19323	Elisabeth	102	" But God wants us to enjoy ourselves , "
19326	19339	19323	19323	Elisabeth	102	" And He would n't really love us if He did n't . "
19340	19362	19190	19190	Felicia	154	" God wants us to do what is right , and it does n't matter whether we enjoy ourselves or not . "
19363	19383	19384	19384	Felicia	154	" But it does ; it matters awfully . We ca n't really be good unless we are happy . "
19389	19422	19384	19384	Felicia	154	" We ca n't really be happy unless we are good ; and if we are good we shall ' love not the world , ' but shall stand apart from it . "
19423	19527	19190	19190	Felicia	154	" But I must love the world ; I ca n't help loving the world , it is so grand and beautiful and funny . I love the whole of it : all the trees and the fields , and the towns and the cities , and the prim old people and the dear little children . I love the places — the old places because I have known them so long , and the new places because I have never seen them before ; and I love the people best of all . I adore people , Felicia ; do n't you ? "
19528	19558	19190	19190	Felicia	154	" No ; I do n't think that I do . Of course I like the people that I like ; but the others seem to me dreadfully uninteresting . "
19559	19629	19384	19384	Felicia	154	" But they are not ; they are all frightfully interesting when once you get to know them , and see what they really are made of inside . Outsides may seem dull ; but insides are always engrossing . That 's why I always love people when once I 've seen them cry , because when they cry they are themselves , and not any make - ups . "
19630	19643	19190	19190	Felicia	154	" How queer to like people because you have seen them cry ! "
19644	19667	19668	19668	Felicia	154	" Well , I do . I 'd do anything for a person that I had seen cry ; I would really . "
19677	19700	19668	19668	Felicia	154	" What a strange idea ! It seems to me that you think too much about feelings and not enough about principles . "
19701	19727	19190	19190	Felicia	154	" But thinking about feelings makes you think about principles ; feelings are the only things that ever make me think about principles at all . "
19738	19757	19734	19734	Elisabeth	102	" What do you mean to do with your life when you leave here and take it up ? "
19758	19797	19190	19190	Felicia	154	" I do n't know . I suppose I shall fall in love and get married . Most girls do . And I hope it will be with a clergyman , for I do so love parish work . "
19798	19809	19811	19811	Elisabeth	102	" I do n't think I want to get married , "
19814	19821	19811	19811	Elisabeth	102	" not even to a clergyman . "
19822	19831	19190	19190	Felicia	154	" How queer of you ! Why not ? "
19832	19906	19190	19190	Felicia	154	" Because I want to paint pictures and to become a great artist . I feel there is such a lot in me that I want to say , and that I must say ; and I can only say it by means of pictures . It would be dreadful to die before you had delivered the message that you had been sent into the world to deliver , do n't you think ? "
19907	19936	19938	19938	Felicia	154	" It would be more dreadful to die before you had found one man to whom you would be everything , and who would be everything to you , "
19940	20022	20024	20024	Elisabeth	102	" Oh ! I mean to fall in love , because everybody does , and I hate to be behindhand with things ; but I shall do it just as an experience , to make me paint better pictures . I read in a book the other day that you must fall in love before you can become a true artist ; so I mean to do so . But it wo n't be as important to me as my art , "
20037	20074	20024	20024	Elisabeth	102	" Still , it must be lovely to know there is one person in the world to whom you can tell all your thoughts , and who will understand them , and be interested in them . "
20075	20111	20112	20112	Elisabeth	102	" It must be far lovelier to know that you have the power to tell all your thoughts to the whole world , and that the world will understand them and be interested in them , "
20115	20187	20112	20112	Elisabeth	102	" I do n't think so . I should like to fall in love with a man who was so much better than I , that I could lean on him and learn from him in everything ; and I should like to feel that whatever goodness or cleverness there was in me was all owing to him , and that I was nothing by myself , but everything with him . "
20188	20222	20024	20024	Elisabeth	102	" I should n't . I should like to feel that I was so good and clever that I was helping the man to be better and cleverer even than he was before . "
20223	20242	20244	20244	Felicia	154	" I should like all my happiness and all my interest to centre in that one particular man , "
20246	20274	20244	20244	Felicia	154	" and to feel that he was a fairy prince , and that I was a poor beggar - maid , who possessed nothing but his love . "
20275	20366	20024	20024	Elisabeth	102	" Oh ! I should n't . I would rather feel that I was a young princess , and that he was a warrior , worn - out and wounded in the battle of life ; but that my love would comfort and cheer him after all the tiresome wars that he 'd gone through . And as for whether he 'd lost or won in the wars , I should n't care a rap , as long as I was sure that he could n't be happy without me . "
20367	20377	20379	20379	Felicia	154	" You and I never think alike about things , "
20382	20404	20379	20379	Felicia	154	" You old darling ! What does it matter , as long as we agree in being fond of each other ? "
20661	20678	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" It 's nice , and so it is , to have Miss Elisabeth back again , "
20686	20700	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" and it makes it so much cheerfuller for Miss Farringdon , too . "
20701	20767	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Maybe it 'll only make it the harder for Miss Farringdon when the time comes for Miss Elisabeth to be removed by death or by marriage ; and which'll be the best for her — poor young lady!—the Lord must decide , for I 'm sure I could n't pass an opinion , only having tried one , and that nothing to boast of . "
20768	20780	20782	20783	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I wonder if Miss Farringdon will leave her her fortune , "
20808	20892	20782	20783	Mrs. Bateson	123	" She may , and she may not ; there 's no prophesying about wills . I 'm pleased to say I can generally foretell when folks is going to die , having done a good bit of sick - nursing in my time afore I married Hankey ; but as to foretelling how they 're going to leave their money , I can no more do it than the babe unborn ; nor nobody can , as ever I heard tell on . "
20893	21045	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" That 's so , Mrs. Hankey . Wills seem to me to have been invented by the devil for the special upsetting of the corpse 's memory . Why , some of the peaceablest folks as I 've ever known — folks as would n't have scared a lady - cow in their lifetime — have left wills as have sent all their relations to the right - about , ready to bite one another 's noses off . Bateson often says to me , ' Kezia , ' he says , ' call no man honest till his will 's read . ' And I 'll be bound he 's in the right . Still , it would be hard to see Miss Elisabeth begging her bread after the way she 's been brought up , and Miss Farringdon would never have the conscience to let her do it . "
21046	21056	21058	21059	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Folks leave their consciences behind with their bodies , "
21061	21078	21058	21059	Mrs. Hankey	134	" and I 've lived long enough to be surprised at nothing where wills are concerned . "
21079	21085	21087	21088	Mrs. Bateson	123	" That is quite true , "
21090	21168	21087	21088	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Now take Miss Anne , for instance : she seemed so set on Miss Elisabeth that you 'd have thought she 'd have left her a trifle ; but not she ! All she had went to her sister , Miss Maria , who 'd got quite enough already . Miss Anne was as sweet and gentle a lady as you 'd wish to see ; but her will was as hard as the nether millstone . "
21169	21186	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" There 's nothing like a death for showing up what a family is made of . "
21187	21327	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" There is n't . Now Mr. William Farringdon 's will was a very cruel one , according to my ideas , leaving everything to his niece and nothing to his son . True , Mr. George was but a barber 's block with no work in him , and I 'm the last to defend that ; and then he did n't want to marry his cousin , Miss Maria , for which I should n't blame him so much ; if a man ca n't choose his own wife and his own newspaper , what can he choose?—certainly not his own victuals , for he is n't fit . But if folks only leave their money to them that have followed their advice in everything , most wills would be nothing but a blank sheet of paper . "
21328	21438	21087	21088	Mrs. Bateson	123	" And if they were , it would n't be a bad thing , Mrs. Bateson ; there would be less sorrow on some sides , and less crape on others , and far less unpleasantness all round . For my part , I doubt if Miss Farringdon will leave her fortune to Miss Elisabeth , and her only a cousin 's child ; for when all is said and done , cousins are but elastic relations , as you may say . The well - to - do ones are like sisters and brothers , and the poor ones do n't seem to be no connection at all . "
21439	21467	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Well , let 's hope that Miss Elisabeth will marry , and have a husband to work for her when Miss Farringdon is dead and gone . "
21468	21520	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Husbands are as uncertain as wills , Mrs. Bateson , and more sure to give offence to them that trust in them ; besides , I doubt if Miss Elisabeth is handsome enough to get a husband . The gentry think a powerful lot of looks in choosing a wife . "
21532	21580	21521	21522	Mrs. Bateson	123	" She may n't be exactly handsome — I do n't pretend as she is ; but she has a wonderful way of dressing herself , and looking for all the world like a fashion - plate ; and some men have a keen eye for clothes . "
21581	21641	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I think nothing of fine clothes myself . Saint Peter warns us against braiding of hair and putting on of apparel ; and when all 's said and done it do n't go as far as a good complexion , and we do n't need any apostle to tell us that — we can see it for ourselves . "
21642	21657	21659	21660	Mrs. Bateson	123	" And as for cleverness , there ai n't her like in all Mershire , "
21662	21743	21659	21660	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Bless you ! cleverness never yet helped a woman in getting a husband , and never will ; though if she 's got enough of it , it may keep her from ever having one . I do n't hold with cleverness in a woman myself ; it has always ended in mischief , from the time when the woman ate a bit of the Tree of Knowledge , and there was such a to - do about it . "
21744	21784	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I wish she 'd marry Mr. Christopher ; he worships the very ground she walks on , and she could n't find a better man if she swept out all the corners of the earth looking for one . "
21785	21857	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Well , at any rate , she knows all about him ; that is something . I always say that men are the same as kittens — you should take 'em straight from their mothers , or else not take 'em at all ; for , if you do n't , you never know what bad habits they may have formed or what queer tricks they will be up to . "
21858	21878	21880	21881	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Maybe the manager 's nephew ai n't altogether the sort of husband you 'd expect for a Farringdon , "
21884	21948	21880	21881	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I do n't deny that . But he 's wonderful fond of her , Mr. Christopher is ; and there 's nothing like love for smoothing things over when the oven ai n't properly heated , and the meat is done to a cinder on one side and all raw on the other . You find that out when you 're married . "
21949	22062	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" You find a good many things out when you 're married , Mrs. Bateson , and one is that this world is a wilderness of care . But as for love , I do n't rightly know much about it , since Hankey would always rather have had my sister Sarah than me , and only put up with me when she gave him the pass - by , being set on marrying one of the family . I 'm sure , for my part , I wish Sarah had had him ; though I 've no call to say so , her always having been a good sister to me . "
22063	22099	22101	22102	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Well , love 's a fine thing ; take my word for it . It keeps the men from grumbling when nothing else will ; except , of course , the grace of God , "
22105	22126	22101	22102	Mrs. Bateson	123	" though even that do n't always seem to have much effect , when things go wrong with their dinners . "
22127	22273	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" That 's because they have n't enough of it ; they have n't much grace in their hearts , as a rule , have n't men , even the best of them ; and the best of them do n't often come my way . But as for Miss Elisabeth , she is n't a regular Farringdon , as you may say — not the real daughter of the works ; and so she should n't take too much upon herself , expecting dukes and ironmasters and the like to come begging to her on their bended knees . She is only Miss Farringdon 's adopted daughter , at best ; and I do n't hold with adopted children , I do n't ; I think it is better and more natural to be born of your own parents , like most folk are . "
22274	22279	22281	22282	Mrs. Bateson	123	" So do I , "
22284	22325	22281	22282	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I 'd never have adopted a child myself . I should always have been expecting to see its parents ' faults coming out in it — so different from the peace you have with your own flesh and blood . "
22330	22347	22326	22327	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Your own flesh and blood may take after their father ; you never can tell . "
22348	22380	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" So they may , Mrs. Hankey — so they may ; but , as the Scripture says , it is our duty to whip the old man out of them . "
22381	22443	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Just so . And that 's another thing against adopted children — you'd hesitate about punishing them enough ; I do n't fancy as you 'd ever feel the same pleasure in whipping 'em as you do in whipping your own . You 'd feel you ought to be polite - like , as if they was sort of visitors . "
22444	22462	22464	22465	Mrs. Bateson	123	" My children always took after my side of the house , I 'm thankful to say , "
22467	22477	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" so I had n't much trouble with them . "
22478	22543	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I wish I could say as much ; I do , indeed . But the Lord saw fit to try me by making my son Peter the very moral of his father ; as like as two peas they are . And when you find one poor woman with such a double portion , you are tempted to doubt the workings of Providence . "
22549	22559	22544	22545	Mrs. Bateson	123	" That 's bad for you , Mrs. Hankey ! "
22560	22650	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" It is so ; but I take up my cross and do n't complain . You know what a feeble creature Hankey is — never doing the right thing ; and , when he does , doing it at the wrong time ; well , Peter is just such another . Only the other day he was travelling by rail , and what must he do but get an attack of the toothache ? Those helpless sort of folks are always having the toothache , if you notice . "
22651	22656	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" So they are . "
22657	22735	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Peter 's toothache was so bad that he must needs take a dose of some sleeping - stuff or other — I forget the name — and fell so sound asleep that he never woke at the station , but was put away with the carriage into a siding . Fast asleep he was , with his handkerchief over his face to keep the sun off , and never heard the train shunted , nor nothing . "
22736	22798	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Well , to be sure ! Them sleeping - draughts are wonderful soothing , as I 've heard tell , but I never took one on 'em . The Lord giveth His beloved sleep , and His givings are enough for them as are in health ; but them as are in pain want something a bit stronger , doubtless . "
22799	22804	22806	22807	Mrs. Hankey	134	" So it appears , "
22809	22905	22806	22807	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Well , there lay Peter fast asleep in the siding , with his handkerchief over his face . And one of the porters happens to come by , and sees him , and jumps to the conclusion that there 's been a murder in the train , and that our Peter is the corpse . So off he goes to the station - master and tells him as there 's a murdered body in one of the carriages in the siding ; and the station - master 's as put out as never was . "
22919	22928	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" What a tale , to be sure ! "
22929	22933	22935	22935	Peter	158	" And then , "
22947	23009	22935	22935	Peter	158	" the station - master sends for the police , and the police sends for the crowner , so as everything shall be decent and in order ; and they walks in a solemn procession — with two porters carrying a shutter — to the carriage where Peter lies , all as grand and nice as if it was a funeral . "
23010	23025	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I never heard tell of such a thing in my life — never ! "
23026	23070	23071	23072	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Then the station - master opens the door with one of them state keys which always take such a long time to open a door which you could open with your own hands in a trice — you know 'em by sight . "
23087	23116	23117	23118	Mrs. Hankey	134	" And then the crowner steps forward to take the handkerchief off the face of the body , it being the perquisite of a crowner so to do , "
23142	23174	23117	23118	Mrs. Hankey	134	" and just picture to yourself the vexation of them all , when it was no murdered corpse they found , but only our Peter with an attack of the toothache ! "
23175	23209	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Well , I never ! They must have been put about ; as you would have been yourself , Mrs. Hankey , if you 'd found so little after expecting so much . "
23210	23264	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" In course I should ; it was n't in flesh and blood not to be , and station - master and crowner are but mortal , like the rest of us . I assure you , when I first heard the story , I pitied them from the bottom of my heart . "
23265	23281	23117	23118	Mrs. Hankey	134	" And what became of Peter in the midst of it all , Mrs. Hankey ? "
23282	23401	20680	20681	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Oh ! it woke him up with a vengeance ; and , of course , it flustered him a good deal , when he rightly saw how matters stood , to have to make his excuses to all them grand gentlemen for not being a murdered corpse . But as I says to him afterward , he 'd no one but himself to blame ; first for being so troublesome as to have the toothache , and then for being so presumptuous as to try and cure it . And his father is just the same ; if you take your eye off him for a minute he is bound to be in some mischief or another . "
23402	23469	23470	23471	Mrs. Hankey	134	" There 's no denying that husbands is troublesome , Mrs. Hankey , and sons is worse ; but all the same I stand up for 'em both , and I wish Miss Elisabeth had got one of the one and half a dozen of the other . Mark my words , she 'll never do better , taking him all round , than Master Christopher . "
23474	23554	23470	23471	Mrs. Hankey	134	" I only hope she 'll find it out before it is too late , and he is either laid in an early grave or else married to a handsomer woman , as the case may be , and both ways out of her reach . But I doubt it . She was a dark baby , if you remember , was Miss Elisabeth ; and I never trust them as has been dark babies , and never shall . "
23555	23564	23566	23567	Mrs. Bateson	123	" And how is Peter 's toothache now ? "
23582	23721	23566	23567	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Oh ! it 's no better ; and I know no one more aggravating than folks who keep sayin ' they are no better when you ask 'em how they are . It always seems so ungrateful . Only this morning I asked our Peter how his tooth was , and he says , ' No better , mother ; it was so bad in the night that I fairly wished I was dead . ' ' Do n't go wishing that , ' says I ; ' for if you was dead you 'd have far worse pain , and it ' ud last for ever and ever . ' I really spoke quite sharp to him , I was that sick of his grumbling ; but it did n't seem to do him no good . "
23722	23731	23732	23733	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Speaking sharp seldom does do much good , "
23737	23744	23732	23733	Mrs. Bateson	123	" except to them as speaks . "
24016	24021	24014	24014	one	543	" long , long thoughts "
24543	24558	24528	24528	he	161	" Have you seen the new man who has come to the Moat House ? "
24622	24630	24601	24601	He	524	" Yes ; I have seen him . "
24631	24643	24601	24601	He	524	" What is he like ? I am dying to know . "
24644	24700	24601	24601	He	524	" When I saw him he was exactly like a man riding on horseback ; but as he was obviously too well - dressed to be a beggar , I have no reason to believe that the direction in which he was riding was the one which beggars on horseback are proverbially expected to take . "
24701	24713	24601	24601	He	524	" How silly you are ! You know what I mean . "
24714	24782	24601	24601	He	524	" Perfectly . You mean that if you had seen a man riding by , at the rate of twelve miles an hour , it would at once have formed an opinion as to all the workings of his mind and the meditations of his heart . But my impressions are of slower growth , and I am even dull enough to require some foundation for them . "
24789	24798	24800	24802	that young lady	498	" I am awfully quick in reading character , "
24808	24834	24800	24802	that young lady	498	" You are . I never know which impresses me more — the rapidity with which you form opinions , or their inaccuracy when formed . "
24835	24845	24601	24601	He	524	" I 'm not as stupid as you think . "
24846	24877	24601	24601	He	524	" Pardon me , I do n't think you are at all stupid ; but I am always hoping that the experience of life will make you a little stupider . "
24878	24895	24601	24601	He	524	" Do n't be a goose , but tell me all you know about Mr. Tremaine . "
24896	24965	24601	24601	He	524	" I do n't know much about him , except that he is well - off , that he apparently rides about ten stone , and that he is not what people call orthodox . By the way . I did n't discover his unorthodoxy by seeing him ride by , as you would have done ; I was told about it by some people who know him . "
24966	24971	24973	24973	Elisabeth	162	" How very interesting ! "
24976	24994	24973	24973	Elisabeth	162	" I wonder how unorthodox he is . Do you think he does n't believe in anything ? "
24995	25046	24601	24601	He	524	" In himself , I fancy . Even the baldest creed is usually self - embracing . But I believe he indulges in the not unfashionable luxury of doubts . You might attend to them , Elisabeth ; you are the sort of girl who would enjoy attending to doubts . "
25047	25058	24601	24601	He	524	" I suppose I really am too fond of arguing . "
25059	25107	24601	24601	He	524	" There you misjudge yourself . You are instructive rather than argumentative . Saying the same thing over and over again in different language is not arguing , you know ; I should rather call it preaching , if I were not afraid of hurting your feelings . "
25108	25135	24601	24601	He	524	" You are a very rude boy ! But , anyway , I have taught you a lot of things ; you ca n't deny that . "
25136	25193	24601	24601	He	524	" I do n't wish to deny it ; I am your eternal debtor . To tell the truth , I believe you have taught me everything I know , that is worth knowing , except the things that you have tried to teach me . There , I must confess , you have signally failed . "
25194	25203	24601	24601	He	524	" What have I tried to teach you ? "
25204	25282	24601	24601	He	524	" Heaps of things : that pleasure is more important than duty ; that we are sent into the world to enjoy ourselves ; that the worship of art is the only soul - satisfying form of faith ; that conscience is an exhausted force ; that feelings and emotions ought to be labelled and scheduled ; that lobster is digestible ; that Miss Herbert is the most attractive woman in the world ; etcetera , etcetera . "
25283	25293	24601	24601	He	524	" And what have I taught you without trying ? "
25294	25325	24601	24601	He	524	" Ah ! that is a large order ; and it is remarkable that the things you have taught me are just the things that you have never learned yourself . "
25326	25335	24601	24601	He	524	" Then I could n't have taught them . "
25336	25349	24601	24601	He	524	" But you did ; that is where your genius comes in . "
25350	25360	25362	25362	Elisabeth	162	" I really am tremendously quick in judging character , "
25365	25400	25362	25362	Elisabeth	162	" if I met you for the first time I should know in five minutes that you were a man with plenty of head , and heaps of soul , and very little heart . "
25401	25411	24601	24601	He	524	" That would show wonderful penetration on your part . "
25412	25447	24601	24601	He	524	" You may laugh , but I should . Of course , as it is , it is not particularly clever of me to understand you thoroughly ; I have known you so long . "
25448	25464	24601	24601	He	524	" Exactly ; it would only be distinctly careless of you if you did not . "
25465	25494	24601	24601	He	524	" Of course it would ; but I do . I could draw a map of your mind with my eyes shut , I know it so well . "
25495	25526	24601	24601	He	524	" I wish you would . I should value it even if it were drawn with your eyes open , though possibly in that case it might be less correct . "
25527	25544	24601	24601	He	524	" I will , if you will give me a pencil and a sheet of paper . "
25609	25614	25615	25615	he	784	" An extensive outline , "
25618	25623	25615	25615	he	784	" this is gratifying . "
25624	25644	25601	25603	The young man	784	" Oh yes ! you have plenty of mind , such as it is ; nobody could deny that . "
25645	25667	25601	25603	The young man	784	" But why is the coast - line all irregular , with such a lot of bays and capes and headlands ? "
25668	25735	25615	25615	he	784	" To show that you are an undecided person , and given to split hairs , and do n't always know your own opinion . First you think you 'll do a thing because it is nice ; and then you think you wo n't do it because it is wrong ; and in the end you drop between two stools , like Mahomet 's coffin . "
25736	25754	25601	25603	The young man	784	" I see . And please what are the mountain - ranges that you are drawing now ? "
25755	25758	25760	25760	Elisabeth	162	" These , "
25770	25797	25760	25760	Elisabeth	162	" are your scruples . Like all other mountain - ranges they hinder commerce , make pleasure difficult , and render life generally rather uphill work . "
25798	25813	25615	25615	he	784	" Do n't I sound exactly as if I was taking a geography class ? "
25814	25820	25822	25822	Christopher	162	" Or conducting an Inquisition , "
25824	25836	25822	25822	Christopher	162	" I thought an Inquisition was a Spanish thing that hurt . "
25837	25861	25615	25615	he	784	" So certain ignorant people say ; but it was originally invented , I believe , to eradicate error and to maintain truth . "
25862	25921	25615	25615	he	784	" I am going on with my geography class , so do n't interrupt . The rivers in this map , which are marked by a few faint lines , are narrow and shallow ; they are only found near the coast , and never cross the interior of the country at all . These represent your feelings . "
25922	25950	25822	25822	Christopher	162	" Very ingenious of you ! And what is that enormous blotch right in the middle of the country , which looks like London and its environs ? "
25951	26016	25615	25615	he	784	" That is your conscience ; its outlying suburbs cover nearly the whole country , you will perceive . You will also notice that there are no seaports on the coast of my map ; that shows that you are self - contained , and that you neither send exports to , nor receive imports from , the hearts and minds of other people . "
26017	26035	25615	25615	he	784	" What ever are those queer little castellated things round the coast that you are drawing now ? "
26036	26058	26060	26060	Elisabeth	162	" Those are floating icebergs , to show that it is a cold country . There , my map is finished , "
26074	26084	26060	26060	Elisabeth	162	" and I consider it a most successful sketch . "
26085	26091	26060	26060	Elisabeth	162	" It is certainly clever . "
26092	26098	26099	26099	Christopher	162	" And true , too . "
26104	26109	26110	26110	he	785	" Give it me , "
26118	26130	26131	26131	he	785	" but sign it with your name first . Not there , "
26146	26152	26136	26136	Elisabeth	162	" right across the middle . "
26159	26170	26153	26153	Elisabeth	162	" Right across the map itself , do you mean ? "
26171	26174	26136	26136	Elisabeth	162	" Yes . "
26175	26191	26153	26153	Elisabeth	162	" But it is such a long name that it will cover the whole country . "
26192	26197	26153	26153	Elisabeth	162	" I know that . "
26198	26204	26136	26136	Elisabeth	162	" It will spoil it . "
26205	26222	26153	26153	Elisabeth	162	" I should n't be surprised ; nevertheless , I always am in favour of realism . "
26223	26249	26251	26251	Elisabeth	162	" I do n't know where the realism comes in ; but I am such an obliging person that I will do what you want , "
26271	26275	26277	26277	Christopher	162	" Thank you , "
26296	26299	26286	26286	he	785	" Elisabeth Farringdon "
26358	26365	26367	26367	Elisabeth	102	" I have seen Mr. Tremaine , "
26378	26406	26367	26367	Elisabeth	102	" Cousin Maria left her card upon him , and he returned her call yesterday and found us at home . I think he is perfectly delightful . "
26407	26419	26341	26341	Chris	125	" You do , do you ? I knew you would . "
26420	26423	26341	26341	Chris	125	" Why ? "
26424	26442	26367	26367	Elisabeth	102	" Because , like the Athenians , you live to see or to hear some new thing . "
26443	26504	26341	26341	Chris	125	" It was n't his newness that made me like him ; I liked him because he was so interesting . I do adore interesting people ! I had n't known him five minutes before he began to talk about really deep things ; and then I felt I had known him for ages , he was so very understanding . "
26505	26508	26509	26509	Christopher	162	" Indeed , "
26513	26548	26509	26509	Christopher	162	" By the time we had finished tea he understood me better than you do after all these years . I wonder if I shall get to like him better than I like you ? "
26549	26555	26557	26557	he	788	" I wonder , too . "
26571	26575	26577	26577	Elisabeth	162	" Of course , "
26580	26638	26577	26577	Elisabeth	162	" I shall always like you , because we have been friends so long , and you are overgrown with the lichen of old memories and associations . But you are not very interesting in the abstract , you see ; you are nice and good , but you have not heart enough to be really thrilling . "
26639	26669	26509	26509	Christopher	162	" Still , even if I had a heart , it is possible I might not always wear it on my sleeve for Miss Elisabeth Farringdon to peck at . "
26670	26704	26509	26509	Christopher	162	" Oh yes , you would ; you could n't help it . If you tried to hide it I should see through your disguises . I have X rays in my eyes . "
26705	26716	26577	26577	Elisabeth	162	" Have you ? They must be a great convenience . "
26717	26731	26509	26509	Christopher	162	" Well , at any rate , they keep me from making mistakes , "
26735	26750	26509	26509	Christopher	162	" That is fortunate for you . It is a mistake to make mistakes . "
26751	26763	26765	26766	the girl	629	" I remember our Dear Lady at Fox How once saying , "
26768	26786	26765	26766	the girl	629	" that nothing is so good for keeping women from making mistakes as a sense of humour . "
26787	26795	26577	26577	Elisabeth	162	" I wonder if she was right ? "
26796	26845	26509	26509	Christopher	162	" She was always right ; and in that as in everything else . Have you never noticed that it is not the women with a sense of humour who make fools of themselves ? They know better than to call a thing romantic which is really ridiculous . "
26846	26872	26765	26766	the girl	629	" Possibly ; but they are sometimes in danger of calling a thing ridiculous which is really romantic ; and that also is a mistake . "
26873	26908	26577	26577	Elisabeth	162	" I suppose it is . I wonder which is worse — to think ridiculous things romantic , or romantic things ridiculous ? It is rather an interesting point . Which do you think ? "
26909	26921	26509	26509	Christopher	162	" I do n't know . I never thought about it . "
26922	26933	26935	26935	Elisabeth	102	" You never do think about things that really matter , "
26943	26996	26935	26935	Elisabeth	102	" that is what makes you so uninteresting to talk to . The fact is you are so wrapped up in that tiresome old business that you never have time to attend to the deeper things and the hidden meanings of life ; but are growing into a regular money - grubber . "
26997	27020	27022	27022	Christopher	162	" Perhaps so ; but you will have the justice to admit it is n't my own money that I am grubbing , "
27198	27205	27206	27206	Elisabeth	102	" It is a great pity , "
27210	27296	27206	27206	Elisabeth	102	" that you deliberately narrow yourself down to such a small world and such petty interests . It is bad enough for old people to be practical and sensible and commonplace and all that ; but for a man as young as you are it is simply disgusting . I can not understand you , because you really are clever and ought to know better ; but although I am your greatest friend , you never talk to me about anything except the merest frivolities . "
27363	27521	27522	27523	The preacher	797	" You laugh at me as long as I am funny and I amuse you ; but the minute I begin to talk about serious subjects — such as feelings and sentiments and emotions — you lose your interest at once , and turn everything into a joke . The truth is , you have so persistently suppressed your higher self that it is dying of inanition ; you 'll soon have no higher self left at all . If people do n't use their hearts they do n't have any , like the Kentucky fish that ca n't see in the dark because they are blind , do n't you know ? Now you should take a leaf out of Mr. Tremaine 's book . The first minute I saw him I knew that he was the sort of man that cultivated his higher self ; he was interested in just the things that interest me . "
27538	27540	27547	27547	her	797	" blessed "
27551	27559	27547	27547	her	797	" What is the matter , Chris ? "
27560	27565	27547	27547	her	797	" Nothing . Why ? "
27566	27621	27547	27547	her	797	" Because you look so awfully white . I was talking so fast that I did n't notice it ; but I expect it is the heat . Do sit down on the grass and rest a bit ; it is quite dry ; and I 'll fan you with a big dock leaf . "
27622	27628	27630	27630	Christopher	162	" I 'm all right , "
27641	27709	27630	27630	Christopher	162	" But I 'm sure you are not , you are so pale ; you look just as you looked the day that I tumbled off the rick — do you remember it?—and you took me into Mrs. Bateson 's to have my head bound up . She said you 'd got a touch of the sun , and I 'm afraid you 've got one now . "
27710	27734	27547	27547	her	797	" Yes , I remember it well enough ; but I 'm all right now , Betty . Do n't worry about me . "
27735	27840	27547	27547	her	797	" But I do worry when you 're ill ; I always did . Do n't you remember that when you had measles and I was n't allowed to see you , I cried myself to sleep for three nights running , because I thought you were going to die , and that everything would be vile without you ? And then I had a prayer - meeting about you in Mrs. Bateson 's parlour , and I wrote the hymns for it myself . The Batesons wept over them and considered them inspired , and foretold that I should die early in consequence . "
27855	27906	27851	27851	Christopher	162	" That was hard on you ! I admit that verse - writing is a crime in a woman , but I should hardly call it a capital offence . Still , I should like to have heard the hymns . You were great at writing poetry in those days . "
27907	27932	27547	27547	her	797	" Was n't I ? And I used to be so proud when you said that my poems were n't ' half bad ' ! "
27933	27952	27953	27954	The hymnist	799	" No wonder ; that was high praise from me . But ca n't you recall those hymns ? "
27959	27970	27971	27971	she	799	" I can remember the beginning of the opening one , "
27974	27998	27971	27971	she	799	" it was a six - line - eights , and we sang it to a tune called Stella ; it began thus : "
28001	28009	27971	27971	she	799	" exclaimed the subject of the hymn . "

28102	28108	28087	28087	you	799	" Which was perfectly true . "
28115	28120	28087	28087	you	799	" said Elisabeth contentedly ; "

28552	28556	28542	28542	her	148	" laughed Elisabeth ; "

28592	28606	28607	28609	Nice old boy	803	" Elisabeth laughed again as she patted his arm in a sisterly fashion . "

28653	28658	28647	28647	you	799	" said Christopher stoutly ; "
28724	28999	29000	29000	I	0	" With which consoling remark he took leave of his liege - lady . The friendship between Alan Tremaine and Elisabeth Farringdon grew apace during the next twelve months . His mind was of the metaphysical and speculative order , which is interesting to all women ; and hers was of the volatile and vivacious type which is attractive to some men . They discussed everything under the sun , and some things over it ; they read the same books and compared notes afterward ; they went out sketching together , and instructed each other in the ways of art ; and they carefully examined the foundations of each other 's beliefs , and endeavoured respectively to strengthen and undermine the same . Gradually they fell into the habit of wondering every morning whether or not they should meet during the coming day ; and of congratulating themselves nearly every evening that they had succeeded in so meeting . As for Christopher , he was extremely and increasingly unhappy , and , it must be admitted , extremely and increasingly cross in consequence . The fact that he had not the slightest right to control Elisabeth 's actions , in no way prevented him from highly disapproving of them ; and the fact that he was too proud to express this disapproval in words , in no way prevented him from displaying it in manner . Elisabeth was wonderfully amiable with him , considering how very cross he was ; but are we not all amiable with people toward whom we — in our inner consciousness — know that we are behaving badly ? "
29014	29036	29006	29006	you	808	" he said to her , when Alan Tremaine had been living at the Moat House for something over a year . "
29049	29054	29045	29045	your	0	" replied Elisabeth suavely . "

29308	29313	29303	29303	I	0	" replied Christopher mendaciously ; "
29346	29374	29315	29315	I	0	" And he actually believed that this was the case . He forgot that it is not the trick of friendship , but of love , to make "
29377	29391	29392	29392	You	808	" in affection , and to monopolize the whole stock of the commodity . "
29395	29399	29392	29392	You	808	" Elisabeth explained , "

29750	29766	29742	29742	You	808	" Christopher was penitent at once ; he could not bear really to vex her . "
29799	29800	29781	29781	you	808	" "

29906	29911	29914	29914	he	161	" persisted the girl . "

29960	29965	29956	29956	he	161	" Elisabeth looked surprised . "

30202	30206	30182	30182	his	161	" retorted Christopher ; "

30411	30442	30443	30443	I	0	" And Elisabeth walked away in high dudgeon , leaving Christopher very angry with himself for having been disagreeable , and still angrier with Tremaine for having been the reverse . "
30454	30465	30443	30443	I	0	" said Tremaine to Elisabeth , in the early summer . "
30549	30550	30553	30553	you	838	" "
30565	30570	30553	30553	you	838	" said Alan earnestly ; "

30623	30646	30620	30620	you	838	" It was noteworthy that while Elisabeth was always ready to teach Christopher , she was equally willing to learn from Alan . "
30726	30727	30719	30719	they	853	" "
30751	30756	30763	30763	they	853	" said Elisabeth eagerly . "

30919	30945	30970	30971	English people	856	" Elisabeth smiled , but did not speak ; Alan was the one person of her acquaintance to whom she would rather listen than talk . "
30954	30959	30970	30971	English people	856	" he went on , "
31053	31054	31070	31070	I	0	" "

31165	31193	31160	31160	you	862	" Elisabeth gasped as Elisha might have gasped when Elijah 's mantle fell upon him . She was as yet too young to beware of false prophets . "
31202	31206	31236	31237	the English	173	" she said ; "

31379	31546	31368	31370	the old faiths	867	" When Whit Monday came round , the throbbing heart of the Osierfield stopped beating , as it was obliged to stop on a bank - holiday ; and the workmen , with their wives and sweethearts , were taken by Alan Tremaine in large brakes to Pembruge Castle , which the owner had kindly thrown open to them , at Alan 's request , for the occasion . It was a long drive and a wonderfully beautiful one , for the year was at its best . All the trees had put on their new summer dresses , and never a pair of them were of the same shade . The hedges were covered with a wreath of white May - blossom , and seemed like interminable drifts of that snow in summer which is as good news from a far country ; and the roads were bordered by the feathery hemlock , which covered the face of the land as with a bridal veil . "
31555	31578	31579	31579	I	0	" said Elisabeth , with a sigh of content , to Alan , who was driving her in his mail - phaeton . "

32090	32132	32087	32087	you	0	" Elisabeth replied . While Alan was thus , enjoying himself in his own fashion , his guests were enjoying themselves in theirs ; and as they drove through summer 's fairyland , they , too , talked by the way . "
32145	32160	32161	32161	I	0	" exclaimed Caleb Bateson , as the big wagonettes rolled along the country roads . "

32304	32312	32313	32313	Folks	3106	" Lucy Ellen 's mother laughed contentedly . "

32985	33182	32975	32975	I	0	" His friends all agreed with him , and continued , for the rest of the drive , to discuss the respective merits of various discourses they had been privileged to hear . It was a glorious day . The sky was blue , with just enough white clouds flitting about to show how blue the blue part really was ; and the varying shadows kept passing , like the caress of some unseen yet ever - protecting Hand , over the green nearnesses and the violet distances of a country whose foundations seemed to be of emerald and amethyst , and its walls and gateways of pearl . The large company from the Osierfield drove across the breezy common at the foot of Sedgehill Ridge , and then plunged into a network of lanes which led them , by sweet and mysterious ways , to the great highway from the Midlands to the coast of the western sea . On they went , past the little hamlet where the Danes and the Saxons fought a great fight more than a thousand years ago , and which is still called by a strange Saxon name , meaning "
33190	33687	32975	32975	I	0	" ; and the little hamlet smiled in the summer sunshine , as if with kindly memories of those old warriors whose warfare had been accomplished so many centuries ago , and who lie together , beneath the white blossom , in the arms of the great peacemaker called Death , waiting for the resurrection morning which that blossom is sent to foretell . On , between man 's walls of gray stone , till they came to God 's walls of red sandstone ; and then up a steep hill to another common , where the sweet - scented gorse made a golden pavement , and where there suddenly burst upon their sight a view so wide and so wonderful that those who look upon it with the seeing eye and the understanding heart catch glimpses of the King in His beauty through the fairness of the land that is very far off . On past the mossy stone , like an overgrown and illiterate milestone , which marks the boundary between Mershire and Salopshire ; and then through a typical English village , noteworthy because the rites of Mayday , with May - queen and May - pole to boot , are still celebrated there exactly as they were celebrated some three hundred years ago . At last they came to a picturesque wall and gateway , built of the red stone which belongs to that part of the country , and which has a trick of growing so much redder at evening - time that it looks as if the cold stone were blushing with pleasure at being kissed Good - night by the sun ; and then through a wood sloping on the left side down to a little stream , which was so busy talking to itself about its own concerns that it had not time to leap and sparkle for the amusement of passers - by ; until they drew up in front of a quaint old castle , built of the same stone as the outer walls and gateway . The family were away from home , so the whole of the castle was at the disposal of Alan and his party , and they had permission to go wherever they liked . The state - rooms were in front of the building and led out of each other , so that when all the doors were open any one could see right from one end of the castle to the other . Dinner was to be served in the large saloon at the back , built over what was once the courtyard ; and while his servants were laying the tables with the cold viands which they had brought with them , Alan took his guests through the state - rooms to see the pictures , and endeavoured to carry out his plan of educating them by pointing out to them some of the finer works of art .

34000	34006	33985	33985	she	942	" joined in Mrs. Hankey ; "

34769	34785	34760	34761	Mr. Tremaine	161	" remarked Mrs. Hankey , not a whit behind the others as regards shocked sensibilities ; "
34801	34802	34794	34794	her	977	" "
34807	34813	34794	34794	her	977	" agreed Mrs. Bateson warmly . "
34851	34864	34865	34865	I	0	" Mr. Bateson endeavoured to take a charitable view of the situation . "

35032	35074	35026	35028	John the Baptist	179	" When the inspection of the pictures had been accomplished , the company sat down to dinner in the large saloon ; and Alan was slightly disconcerted when they opened the proceedings by singing , at the top of their voices , "
35083	35420	35081	35081	Lord	990	" Elisabeth , on seeing the expression of his face , sorely wanted to laugh ; but she stifled this desire , as she had learned by experience that humour was not one of Alan 's strong points . Now Christopher could generally see when a thing was funny , even when the joke was at his own expense ; but Alan took life more seriously , which — as Elisabeth assured herself — showed what a much more earnest man than Christopher he was , in spite of his less orthodox opinions . So she made up her mind that she would not catch Christopher 's eye on the present occasion , as she usually did when anything amused her , because it was cruel to laugh at the frustration of poor Alan 's high - flown plans ; and then naturally she looked straight at the spot where Chris was presiding over a table , and returned his smile of perfect comprehension . It was one of Elisabeth 's peculiarities that she invariably did the thing which she had definitely made up her mind not to do . After dinner the party broke up and wandered about , in small detachments , over the park and through the woods and by the mere , until it was tea - time . Alan spent most of his afternoon in explaining to Elisabeth the more excellent ways whereby the poor may be enabled to share the pleasures of the rich ; and Christopher spent most of his in carrying Johnnie Stubbs to the mere and taking him for a row , and so helping the crippled youth to forget for a short time that he was not as other men are , and that it was out of pity that he , who never worked , had been permitted to take the holiday which he could not earn . After tea Alan and Elisabeth were standing on the steps leading from the saloon to the garden . "
35428	35495	35081	35081	Lord	990	" exclaimed Alan , pointing to the huge figure of Caleb Bateson , who was talking to Jemima Stubbs on the far side of the lawn . Caleb certainly justified this admiration , for he was a fine specimen of a Mershire puddler — and there is no finer race of men to be found anywhere than the puddlers of Mershire . Elisabeth 's eyes twinkled . "
35506	35577	35081	35081	Lord	990	" she remarked demurely . Displeasure settled on Alan 's brow ; he greatly objected to Elisabeth 's habit of making fun of things , and had tried his best to cure her of it . To a great extent he had succeeded ( for the time being ) ; but even yet the cloven foot of Elisabeth 's levity now and then showed itself , much to his regret . "
35584	35589	35676	35676	they	995	" he replied coldly . "
35606	35642	35643	35643	He	127	" Tremaine never failed to enjoy his own rounded sentences , and this one pleased him so much that it almost succeeded in dispelling the cloud which Elisabeth 's ill - timed gibe had created . "
35654	35658	35643	35643	He	127	" she added . "
35668	35669	35672	35672	they	995	" "
35698	35713	35679	35679	Caleb	127	" Elisabeth explained . Alan never quarrelled with people ; he always reproved them . "
35761	35780	35781	35781	My	0	" Elisabeth tossed her head ; she did not like to be reproved , even by Alan Tremaine . "
35790	35794	35781	35781	My	0	" she retorted ; "
35860	35884	35885	35885	You	0	" In the meantime Jemima Stubbs was pouring out a recital of her grievances into the ever - sympathetic ear of Caleb Bateson . "
35897	35920	35885	35885	You	0	" he had said in his cheery voice , laying a big hand in tender caress upon the girl 's narrow shoulders . "
35939	35947	35926	35927	Mr. Bateson	132	" she replied in her quavering treble . "

36939	36951	36929	36929	you	132	" exclaimed Alan Tremaine , coming up and interrupting the conversation . "

37054	37076	37077	37077	I	0	" Alan smiled rather scornfully : how credulous were the lower classes , he thought in his pride of intellectual superiority . "
37093	37114	37082	37082	you	1057	" he said . The giant turned and looked on his fragile frame with eyes full of a great pity . "
37228	37229	37230	37230	My	0	" "
37253	37254	37235	37235	you	1067	" "

37370	37375	37378	37378	you	1057	" Caleb smiled indulgently . "
37487	37488	37489	37489	I	0	" "
37496	37497	37489	37489	I	0	" "
37665	37712	37797	37797	you	0	" Tremaine looked thoughtful ; Caleb 's childlike faith and extensive vocabulary were alike puzzles to him . He did not understand that in homes — however simple — where the Bible is studied until it becomes as household words , the children are accustomed to a "
37717	37763	37764	37764	I	0	" ; and so , unconsciously , mould their style upon and borrow their expressions from the Book which , even when taken only from a literary standpoint , is the finest Book ever read by man . After a minute 's silence he said : "
37802	37803	37797	37797	you	0	" "
37819	37820	37797	37797	you	0	" "

38012	38022	38023	38023	You	1092	" Tremaine merely smiled , and Bateson went on — "
38156	38157	38146	38146	your	161	" "
38192	38193	38197	38197	I	0	" "
38311	38421	38309	38309	Himself	176	" Thus the rich man and the poor man talked together , moving along parallel lines , neither understanding , and each looking down upon the other — Alan with the scornful pity of the scholar who has delved in the dust of dreary negatives which generations of doubters have gradually heaped up ; and Caleb with the pitiful scorn of one who has been into the sanctuary of God , and so learned to understand the end of these men . Late that night , when all the merrymakers had gone to their homes , Tremaine sat smoking in the moonlight on the terrace of the Moat House . "
38426	38432	38309	38309	Himself	176	" he said to himself , "
38527	38553	38554	38554	We	1125	" At that very moment Caleb was closing the day , as was his custom , with family prayer , and his prayer ran thus — "
38736	38770	38726	38727	O Lord	1138	" Thus Caleb prayed , and Alan could not hear him , and could not have understood him even if he had heard . But there was One who heard , and understood . "
38788	38811	38782	38783	Cousin Maria	100	" Elisabeth asked of Christopher , as the two were walking together — as they walked not unfrequently — in Badgering Woods . "

39767	39781	39782	39782	I	0	" Elisabeth 's mood changed at once , and her face grew serious . "

39909	39913	39907	39907	themselves	2982	" suggested Christopher . "

40222	40223	40215	40216	the Puritan	188	" "
40233	40238	40239	40239	they	1189	" Elisabeth went on ; "

40397	40429	40430	40431	The Greeks	172	" Christopher , like other people , looked at most matters from his own individual standpoint ; and his own individual standpoint was not at all a comfortable spot just then . "
40443	40447	40470	40471	modern Christianity	191	" replied Elisabeth , "
40537	41293	40520	40521	the Being	1204	" Thus had Alan Tremaine 's influence gradually unmoored Elisabeth from the old faiths in which she had been brought up ; and he had done it so gradually that the girl was quite unconscious of how far she had drifted from her former anchorage . He was too well - bred ever to be blatant in his unbelief — he would as soon have thought of attacking a man 's family to his face as of attacking his creed ; but subtly and with infinite tact he endeavoured to prove that to adapt ancient revelations to modern requirements was merely putting new wine into old bottles and mending old garments with new cloth ; and Elisabeth was as yet too young and inexperienced to see any fallacy in his carefully prepared arguments . She had nobody to help her to resist him , poor child ! and she was dazzled with the consciousness of intellectual power which his attitude of mind appeared to take for granted . Miss Farringdon was cast in too stern a mould to have any sympathy or patience with the blind gropings of an undisciplined young soul ; and Christopher — who generally understood and sympathized with all Elisabeth 's difficulties and phases — was so jealous of her obvious attachment to Tremaine , and so unhappy on account of it , that for the time being the faithful friend was entirely swallowed up in the irate lover , sighing like one of the Osierfield furnaces . Of course this was very unfair and tiresome of him — nobody could deny that ; but it is sometimes trying to the amiability of even the best of men to realize that the purely mundane and undeserved accident of want of money can shut them off entirely from ever attaining to the best kind of happiness whereof their natures are capable — and especially when they know that their natures are capable of attaining and appreciating a very high standard of happiness indeed . It may not be right to be unsociable because one is unhappy , but it is very human and most particularly masculine ; and Christopher just then was both miserable and a man . There was much about Alan that was very attractive to Elisabeth : he possessed a certain subtlety of thought and an almost feminine quickness of perception which appealed powerfully to her imagination . Imagination was Elisabeth 's weak , as well as her strong , point . She was incapable of seeing people as they really were ; but erected a purely imaginary edifice of character on the foundations of such attributes as her rapid intuition either rightly or wrongly perceived them to possess . As a rule , she thought better of her friends than they deserved — or , at any rate , she recognised in them that ideal which they were capable of attaining , but whereto they sometimes failed to attain . Life is apt to be a little hard on the women of Elisabeth 's type , who idealize their fellows until the latter lose all semblance of reality ; for experience , with its inevitable disillusionment , can not fail to put their ideal lovers and friends far from them , and to hide their etherealized acquaintances out of their sight ; and to give instead , to the fond , trusting souls , half - hearted lovers , semi - sincere friends , and acquaintances who care for them only as the world can care . Poor imaginative women — who dreamed that you had found a perfect knight and a faithful friend , and then discovered that these were only an ordinary selfish man and woman after all — life has many more such surprises in store for you ; and the surprises will shock you less and hurt you more as the years roll on ! But though life will have its surprises for you , death perchance will have none ; for when the secrets of all hearts are opened , and all thwarted desires are made known , it may be that the ordinary selfish man and woman will stand forth as the perfect knight and faithful friend that God intended them , and you believed them , and they tried yet failed to be ; and you will be satisfied at last when you see your beloved ones wake up after His likeness , and will smile as you say to them , "
41302	41661	41298	41298	you	1205	" Although Tremaine might be lacking in his duty toward God , he fulfilled ( in the spirit if not in the letter ) his duty toward his neighbour ; and Elisabeth was fairly dazzled by his many schemes for making life easier and happier to the people who dwelt in the darkness of the Black Country . It was while he was thus figuring as her ideal hero that Elisabeth went to stay with Felicia Herbert , near a manufacturing town in Yorkshire . Felicia had been once or twice to the Willows , and was well acquainted with the physical and biographical characteristics of the place ; and she cherished a profound admiration both for Miss Farringdon and Christopher Thornley . Tremaine she had never met — he had been abroad each time that she had visited Sedgehill — but she disapproved most heartily of his influence upon Elisabeth , and of his views as set forth by that young lady . Felicia had been brought up along extremely strict lines , and in a spirit of comfortable intolerance of all forms of religion not absolutely identical with her own ; consequently , a man with no form of religion at all was to her a very terrible monster indeed . On the Sundays of her early youth she had perused a story treating of an Unbeliever ( always spelled with a capital U ) , and the punishments that were meted out to the daughter of light who was unequally yoked with him ; and she was imbued with a strong conviction that these same punishments were destined to fall upon Elisabeth 's head , should Elisabeth incline favourably to the ( at present ) hypothetical suit of the master of the Moat House . Thus it happened that when Elisabeth came to the Herberts ' , full of girlish admiration for Alan Tremaine , Felicia did her best to ripen that admiration into love by abusing Alan in and out of season , and by endeavouring to prove that an attachment to him would be a soul - destroyer of the most irreparable completeness . "
41673	41677	41678	41678	nobody	409	" she said ; "

42122	42133	42120	42120	Elisabeth	102	" Felicia 's Madonna - like face became quite sorrowful . "

42344	42354	42335	42335	he	121	" she expostulated feebly . Elisabeth shrugged her shoulders . "
42400	42401	42384	42384	he	121	" "
42413	42442	42405	42405	he	121	" Felicia always had to have things fully explained to her ; excess of imagination could never lead her astray , whatever it might do to her friend . "
42477	42488	42472	42472	they	446	" replied Elisabeth , who had still much to learn . "

42645	42665	42635	42635	they	2982	" Elisabeth 's face grew thoughtful ; she was always interested in the analysis of herself and her friends . "
42759	42771	42751	42751	he	121	" Felicia 's pretty month fell into stern lines of disapproval . "
42785	42789	42778	42779	Mr. Tremaine	161	" she said . "

42940	42962	42933	42933	Christopher	121	" Unlike Elisabeth , Felicia never saw what did not exist , and therefore was able sometimes to perceive what did . "
43016	43021	43006	43006	he	121	" Felicia looked dubious . "
43032	43033	43025	43025	you	154	" "
43122	43251	43252	43252	You	1243	" Elisabeth was very hard on Christopher just then , and nothing that Felicia could say succeeded in softening her . Women are apt to be hard when they are quite young — and sometimes even later . Felicia Herbert was the eldest of a large family . Her parents , though well - to - do , were not rich ; and it was the dream of Mrs. Herbert 's life that her daughter 's beauty should bring about a great match . She was a good woman according to her lights , and a most excellent wife and mother ; but if she had a weakness — and who ( except , of course , one 's self ) is without one?—that weakness was social ambition . "
43259	43266	43252	43252	You	1243	" she said confidentially to Elisabeth , "

43324	43350	43313	43313	I	0	" replied Elisabeth , strong in the unworldliness of those who have never known what it is to do without anything that money can buy . "
43427	43428	43419	43419	she	154	" "
43434	43439	43441	43441	she	154	" exclaimed Elisabeth enthusiastically ; "

One of the secrets of Elisabeth 's popularity was that she had a knack of impressing the people with whom she talked , not so much with a sense of her cleverness as with a sense of their own . She not only talked well herself , she made other people talk well also — a far more excellent gift . "

44027	44088	43987	43987	I	0	" exclaimed Mrs. Herbert , so full of pity for Christopher that she was willing to give him anything short of her firstborn . She was really a kind - hearted woman . Elisabeth looked out of the window at the group of stunted shrubs with black - edged leaves which entitled Felicia 's home to be called Wood Glen . "
44101	44106	43987	43987	I	0	" she said solemnly , "

44300	44313	44315	44315	you	1283	" Elisabeth opened her eyes wide with an expression of childlike simplicity . "

44470	44481	44451	44451	I	0	" said Mrs. Herbert , with reproof in her tone ; "

44637	44638	44640	44640	I	0	" "
44655	44661	44643	44643	you	1283	" said Mrs. Herbert severely . "
44674	44682	44667	44667	I	0	" replied Elisabeth , with engaging frankness ; "
44730	44731	44723	44723	he	121	" "
44750	44751	44723	44723	he	121	" "
44755	44763	44723	44723	he	121	" replied Elisabeth , shaking her head ; "
44854	44860	44866	44866	you	0	" Mrs. Herbert looked shocked . "
44869	44870	44866	44866	you	0	" "
44979	45100	44969	44969	Providence	136	" Whereupon Felicia entered the room , and the conversation was abruptly closed ; but not before Mrs. Herbert had decided that if Providence had selected her daughter as the consoler of Christopher 's sorrows , Providence must be gently and patiently reasoned with until another and more suitable comforter was substituted . She did not , of course , put the matter to herself thus barely ; but this was what her decision practically amounted to . But although people might not be talking , as Mrs. Herbert imagined , about Christopher and Felicia , the tongues of Sedgehill were all agog on the subject of the evident attachment between Elisabeth Farringdon and the master of the Moat House . "
45120	45148	45116	45116	I	0	" Mrs. Bateson confided to her crony , Mrs. Hankey . Mrs. Hankey , as was her wo nt , groaned both in spirit and in person . "

46487	46498	46470	46471	Mr. Tremaine	161	" said Mrs. Bateson , her voice softening with pity ; "

46778	46790	46773	46773	you	100	" asked Elisabeth , not long after her return from Yorkshire . "
46835	46836	46837	46837	I	0	" "
46852	46878	46845	46845	I	0	" said the girl , walking across the room and looking through the window at the valley smiling in the light of the summer morning ; "

46938	46948	46951	46951	he	161	" Elisabeth began playing with the blind - cord . "
46956	46960	46951	46951	he	161	" she remarked . "

47111	47115	47106	47106	he	161	" suggested Elisabeth . "

47155	47164	47145	47145	he	161	" Miss Farringdon looked sternly at the speaker . "
47292	47293	47276	47276	he	3356	" "
47311	47315	47299	47301	quite nice people	1411	" argued Elisabeth . "
47396	47397	47398	47398	I	0	" "
47401	47408	47398	47398	I	0	" Elisabeth 's tone was subdued . "
47415	47420	47412	47413	a woman	469	" continued Miss Farringdon , "
47511	47512	47499	47500	this woman	942	" "
47545	47549	47550	47550	You	1428	" Elisabeth persisted . "
47607	47608	47600	47600	I	0	" "
47745	47762	47763	47766	The Bishop of Merchester	1439	" Elisabeth , seeing that her cousin was in the right , wisely changed the subject . "
47803	47837	47788	47789	Alan Tremaine	161	" Although she had strayed from the old paths of dogma and doctrine , Elisabeth could not eradicate the inborn Methodist nature which hungers and thirsts after righteousness as set forth in sermons . "
47849	47862	47843	47843	him	161	" said Miss Farringdon , who also had been born a Methodist . "
47885	47901	47883	47883	Alan	161	" said Elisabeth , with disappointment written in capital letters all over her expressive face . "
47913	47914	47883	47883	Alan	161	" "
47925	47980	47883	47883	Alan	161	" replied the girl , knowing that this was the hour of the evening sacrifice at East Lane Chapel , and trusting to the power of habit and early association to avert the addition of that third which would render two no longer any company for each other . Her trust was not misplaced . "
48001	48014	47998	47998	you	0	" Elisabeth endeavoured to simulate the sudden awakening of a dormant memory . "
48019	48020	48021	48021	I	0	" "
48037	48043	48034	48035	the Bishop	1444	" said Miss Farringdon kindly . "
48080	48276	48067	48067	I	0	" So it came to pass , one never - to - be - forgotten summer afternoon , that Alan Tremaine drove Elisabeth Farringdon into Silverhampton to hear the Bishop of Merchester preach . As soon as she was safely tucked up in the dog - cart , with no way of escape , Elisabeth saw a look in Alan 's eyes which told her that he meant to make love to her ; so with that old , old feminine instinct , which made the prehistoric woman take to her heels when the prehistoric man began to run after her , this daughter of the nineteenth century took refuge in an armour of flippancy , which is the best shield yet invented for resisting Cupid 's darts . It was a glorious afternoon — one of those afternoons which advertise to all the world how excellent was the lotus - eaters ' method of dividing time ; and although the woods had exchanged the fresh variety of spring for the dark green sameness of summer , the fields were gay with haymakers , and the world still seemed full of joyous and abundant life . "
48284	48291	48067	48067	I	0	" Elisabeth had said at starting ; "
48302	48378	48380	48380	you	1451	" So the two drove by Badgering Woods , and across the wide common ; and as they went they saw and felt that the world was very good . Elisabeth was highly sensitive to the influences of nature , and , left to herself , would have leaned toward sentiment on such an afternoon as this ; but she had seen that look in Alan 's eyes , and that was enough for her . "
48383	48391	48380	48380	you	1451	" began Tremaine , getting to work , "
48480	48481	48470	48471	different men	1456	" "
48501	48529	48470	48471	different men	1456	" suggested Elisabeth , with a nervous , girlish laugh . Alan did not smile ; he made it a rule never to encourage flippancy in women . "
48546	48550	48535	48535	you	1451	" he said , "
48596	48597	48583	48583	I	0	" "
48660	48673	48638	48638	they	1458	" There was a moment 's silence , and then Alan said — "
48706	48707	48688	48688	I	0	" "
48803	48804	48812	48812	I	0	" "
48815	48816	48812	48812	I	0	" "
48823	48824	48812	48812	I	0	" "
48839	48921	48922	48922	I	0	" Elisabeth fell into the trap ; she could never resist the opportunity of discussing herself from an outside point of view . If Alan had said you , she would have snubbed him at once ; but the well - chosen words , a woman of your type , completely carried her away . She was not an egotist ; she was only intensely interested in herself as the single specimen of humanity which she was able to study exhaustively . "
48935	48940	48931	48933	the unresponsive people	1466	" she replied thoughtfully ; "
49076	49077	49059	49062	the people who argue	1469	" "
49130	49131	49139	49139	I	0	" "
49134	49138	49139	49139	I	0	" Elisabeth continued , "
49189	49190	49191	49191	I	0	" "
49200	49201	49195	49195	they	1472	" "
49298	49320	49287	49287	He	121	" Alan smiled faintly at this ; jokes at Christopher 's expense were naturally more humorous than jokes at his own . "
49331	49335	49287	49287	He	121	" he asked . "
49364	49371	49359	49359	They	1476	" And Elisabeth began to laugh . "
49475	49476	49469	49469	I	0	" "
49480	49481	49482	49482	Christopher	121	" "
49498	49503	49482	49482	Christopher	121	" said Elisabeth thoughtfully . "
49567	49568	49557	49558	the Furies	1482	" "
49577	49628	49629	49629	He	121	" Elisabeth 's eyes flashed . She did not mind finding fault with Christopher herself ; in fact , she found such fault - finding absolutely necessary to her well - being ; but she resented any attempt on the part of another to usurp this , her peculiar prerogative . "
49638	49642	49629	49629	He	121	" she said , "
49654	49676	49648	49648	he	121	" But Alan was bored by Christopher as a subject of conversation , so he changed him for Elisabeth 's self . "
49682	49688	49648	49648	he	121	" he exclaimed with admiration ; "
49703	49721	49722	49722	You	1485	" The girl , having just been guilty of disloyalty , was naturally delighted at this compliment . "
49729	49784	49722	49722	You	1485	" she said gratefully , unconscious of the fact that it was Alan 's lack of understanding and appreciation which had aroused her gratitude just then . Perfect comprehension — untempered by perfect love — would be a terrible thing ; mercifully for us poor mortals it does not exist . Alan went on : "
49847	50051	49820	49820	you	0	" Elisabeth looked up at him , her face full of interest ; no appeal to her pity was ever made in vain . If people expected her to admire them , they were frequently disappointed ; if they wished her to fear them , their wish was absolutely denied ; but if they only wanted her to be sorry for them , they were abundantly satisfied , sympathy being the keynote of her character . She was too fastidious often to admire ; she was too strong ever to fear ; but her tenderness was unfailing toward those who had once appealed to her pity , and whose weakness had for once allowed itself to rest upon her strength . Therefore Alan 's desire to help the poor , and to make them happier , struck the dominant chord in her nature ; but unfortunately when she raised her eyes , full of sympathetic sympathy , to his , she encountered that look in the latter which had frightened her at the beginning of the excursion ; so she again clothed herself in her garment of flippancy , and hardened her heart as the nether millstone . In blissful unconsciousness Alan continued — "
50141	50142	50143	50143	I	0	" "
50318	50319	50322	50322	you	1493	" "

50429	50430	50427	50427	you	1493	" "
50468	50469	50462	50462	she	1501	" "
50559	50560	50548	50548	you	1493	" "
50571	50590	50563	50563	I	0	" Alan frowned ; he disapproved of jokes even more than of creeds , and understood them equally . "
50666	50686	50689	50689	I	0	" The laughter vanished from Elisabeth 's face , as if it had been wiped out with a sponge . "
50696	50701	50691	50691	I	0	" she murmured lamely . "
50776	50777	50728	50728	Your	1493	" "
50780	50781	50728	50728	Your	1493	" "
50888	50895	50904	50904	you	1493	" Elisabeth thought for a moment . "
50898	50903	50904	50904	you	1493	" she answered slowly ; "
50935	50936	50904	50904	you	1493	" "
50985	50986	50974	50974	You	1493	" "
50993	50994	50974	50974	You	1493	" "
51092	51734	51737	51737	thou	1521	" Elisabeth was silent ; she was too much excited to speak . Her heart was thumping like the great hammer at the Osierfield , and she was trembling all over . So she held her peace as they drove up the principal street of Silverhampton and across the King 's Square to the lych - gate of St. Peter 's Church ; but Alan , looking into the tell - tale face he knew so well , was quite content . Yet as she sat beside Alan in St. Peter 's Church that summer evening , and thought upon what she had just done , a great sadness filled Elisabeth 's soul . The sun shone brightly through the western window , and wrote mystic messages upon the gray stone walls ; but the lights of the east window shone pale and cold in the distant apse , where the Figure of the Crucified gleamed white upon a foundation of emerald . And as she looked at the Figure , which the world has wept over and worshipped for nineteen centuries , she realized that this was the Symbol of all that she was giving up and leaving behind her — the Sign of that religion of love and sorrow which men call Christianity . She felt that wisdom must be justified of her children , and not least of her , Elisabeth Farringdon ; nevertheless , she mourned for the myth which had once made life seem fair , and death even fairer . Although she had outgrown her belief in it , its beauty had still power to touch her heart , if not to convince her intellect ; and she sighed as she recalled all that it had once meant , and how it had appeared to be the one satisfactory solution to the problems which weary and perplex mankind . Now she must face all the problems over again in the grim twilight of dawning science , with no longer a Star of Bethlehem to show where the answer might be found ; and her spirit quailed at the pitiless prospect . She had never understood before how much that Symbol of eternal love and vicarious suffering had been to her , nor how puzzling would be the path through the wilderness if there were no Crucifix at life 's cross - roads to show the traveller which way to go ; and her heart grew heavier as she took part in the sacred office of Evensong , and thought how beautiful it all would be if only it were true . She longed to be a little child again — a child to whom the things which are not seen are as the things which are seen , and the things which are not as the things which are ; and she could have cried with homesickness when she remembered how firmly she had once believed that the shadow which hung over the Osierfield was a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night , to testify that God was still watching over His people , as in the days of old . Now she knew that the pillar was only the smoke and the flame of human industries ; and the knowledge brought a load of sadness , as it seemed to typify that there was no longer any help for the world but in itself . When the Bishop ascended the pulpit , Elisabeth recalled her wandering thoughts and set herself to listen . No one who possesses a drop of Nonconformist blood can ever succeed in not listening to a sermon , even if it be a poor one ; and the Bishop of Merchester was one of the finest preachers of his day . His text was , "
51752	52341	52342	52342	I	0	" ; and he endeavoured to set forth how it is only God who can teach men about God , and how flesh and blood can never show us the Christ until He chooses to reveal Himself . At first Elisabeth listened only with her mind , expecting an intellectual treat and nothing more ; but as he went on , and showed how the Call comes in strange places and at strange times , and how when it comes there is no resisting it , her heart began to burn within her ; and she recognised the preacher , not only as a man of divers gifts and great powers , but as the ambassador of Christ sent direct to her soul . Then slowly her eyes were opened , and she knew that the Figure in the east window was no Sign of an imaginary renunciation , no Symbol of a worn - out creed , but the portrait of a living Person , Whose Voice was calling her , and Whose Love was constraining her , and Whose Power was enfolding her and would not let her go . With the certainty that is too absolute for proof , she knew in Whom she now believed ; and she knew , further , that it was not her own mind nor the preacher 's words that had suddenly shown her the truth — flesh and blood had not revealed it to her , but Christ Himself . When the service was over , Elisabeth came out into the sunlight with a strange , new , exultant feeling , such as she had never felt before . She stood in the old churchyard , waiting for Alan to bring round the dog - cart , and watching the sun set beyond the distant hills ; and she was conscious — how she could not explain — that the sunset was different from any other sunset that she had ever seen . She had always loved nature with an intense love ; but now there seemed a richer gold in the parting sunbeams — a sweeter mystery behind the far - off hills — because of that Figure in the east window . It was as if she saw again a land which she had always loved , and now learned for the first time that it belonged to some one who was dear to her ; a new sense of ownership mingled with the old delight , and gave an added interest to the smallest detail . Then she and Alan turned their backs to the sunset , and drove along the bleak high - road toward Sedgehill , where the reflection of the blast - furnaces — that weird aurora borealis of the Black Country — was already beginning to pulsate against the darkening sky . And here again Elisabeth realized that for her the old things had passed away , and all things had become new . She felt that her childish dream was true , and that the crimson light was indeed a pillar of fire showing that the Lord was in the midst of His people ; but she went further now than she had gone in her day - dreams , and knew that all the lights and shadows of life are but pillars of cloud and of fire , forthtelling the same truth to all who have seeing eyes and understanding hearts . Suddenly the silence was broken by Alan . "
52405	52406	52407	52407	I	0	" "
52415	52429	52407	52407	I	0	" Elisabeth replied , and her eyes shone like stars in the twilight ; "
52486	52493	52480	52480	His	105	" Tremaine looked at her pityingly . "

52789	52801	52787	52787	He	1527	" There was a short silence , and then Tremaine said — "

52861	52862	52863	52863	I	0	" "

52906	52910	52897	52897	I	0	" he complained . "
52982	52983	52975	52975	I	0	" "
53001	53019	52994	52994	you	102	" sneered Tremaine . Elisabeth pondered for a moment , with the old contraction of her eyebrows . "
53145	53146	53147	53147	You	102	" "
53187	53188	53191	53191	me	0	" "
53196	53200	53191	53191	me	0	" besought Elisabeth . "
53239	53240	53241	53241	I	0	" "
53246	53255	53241	53241	I	0	" Elisabeth still pleaded . Tremaine laughed bitterly . "
53294	53300	53279	53279	you	102	" Elisabeth smiled to herself . "
53310	54550	53307	53308	the Christ	1536	" she answered softly . After having been weighed in Elisabeth 's balance and found wanting , Alan Tremaine went abroad for a season , and Sedgehill knew him no more until the following spring . During that time Elisabeth possessed her soul and grew into a true woman — a woman with no smallness or meanness in her nature , but with certain feminine weaknesses which made her all the more lovable to those people who understood her , and all the more incongruous and irritating to those who did not . Christopher , too , rested in an oasis of happiness just then . He was an adept in the study of Elisabeth , and he knew perfectly well what had passed between her and Alan , although she flattered herself that she had kept him completely in the dark on the subject . But Christopher was always ready to dance to Elisabeth 's piping , except when it happened to be on red - hot iron ; even then he tried to obey her bidding , and it was hardly his fault if he failed . Christopher Thornley was one of those people whose temperament and surroundings are at war with each other . Such people are not few in this world , though they themselves are frequently quite unaware of the fact ; nevertheless , there is always an element of tragedy in their lot . By nature he was romantic and passionate and chivalrous , endowed with an enthusiastic admiration for beauty and an ardent longing for all forms of joyousness ; and he had been trained in a school of thought where all merely human joys and attractions are counted as unimportant if not sinful , and where wisdom and righteousness are held to be the two only ends of life . Perhaps in a former existence — or in the person of some remote ancestor — Christopher had been a knightly and devoted cavalier , ready to lay down his life for Church and king , and in the meantime spending his days in writing odes to his mistress 's eyebrow ; and now he had been born into a strict Puritan atmosphere , where principles rather than persons commanded men 's loyalty , and where romance was held to be a temptation of the flesh if not a snare of the devil . He possessed a great capacity for happiness , and for enjoyment of all kinds ; consequently the dull routine of business was more distasteful to him than to a man of coarser fibre and less fastidious tastes . Christopher was one of the people who are specially fitted by nature to appreciate to the full all the refinements and accessories of wealth and culture ; therefore his position at the Osierfield was more trying to him than it would have been to nine men out of every ten . When spring came back again , Alan Tremaine came with it to the Moat House ; and at the same time Felicia Herbert arrived on a visit to the Willows . Alan had enough of the woman in his nature to decide that — Elisabeth not being meant for him — Elisabeth was not worth the having ; but , although she had not filled his life so completely as to make it unendurable without her , she had occupied his thoughts sufficiently to make feminine society and sympathy thenceforth a necessity of his being . So it came to pass that when he met Felicia and saw that she was fair , he straightway elected her to the office which Elisabeth had created and then declined to fill ; and because human nature — and especially young human nature — is stronger even than early training or old associations , Felicia fell in love with him in return , in spite of ( possibly because of ) her former violent prejudice against him . To expect a person to be a monster and then to find he is a man , has very much the same effect as expecting a person to be a man and finding him a fairy prince ; we accord him our admiration for being so much better than our fancy painted him , and we crave his forgiveness for having allowed it to paint him in such false colours . Then we long to make some reparation to him for our unjust judgment ; and — if we happen to be women — this reparation frequently takes the form of ordering his dinner for the rest of his dining days , and of giving him the right to pay our dressmakers ' bills until such time as we cease to be troubled with them . Consequently that particular year the spring seemed to have come specially for the benefit of Alan and Felicia . For them the woods were carpeted with daffodils , and the meadows were decked in living green ; for them the mountains and hills broke forth into singing , and the trees of the field clapped their hands . Most men and women have known one spring - time such as this in their lives , whereof all the other spring - times were but images and types ; and , maybe , even that one spring - time was but an image and a type of the great New Year 's Day which shall be Time 's to - morrow . But while these two were wandering together in fairyland , Elisabeth felt distinctly left out in the cold . Felicia was her friend — Alan had been her lover ; and now they had drifted off into a strange new country , and had shut the door in her face . There was no place for her in this fairyland of theirs ; they did not want her any longer ; and although she was too large - hearted for petty jealousies , she could not stifle that pang of soreness with which most of us are acquainted , when our fellow - travellers slip off by pairs into Eden , and leave us to walk alone upon the dusty highway . Elisabeth could no more help flirting than some people can help stammering . It was a pity , no doubt ; but it would have been absurd to blame her for it . She had not the slightest intention of breaking anybody 's heart ; she did not take herself seriously enough to imagine such a contingency possible ; but the desire to charm was so strong within her that she could not resist it ; and she took as much trouble to win the admiration of women as of men . Therefore , Alan and Felicia having done with her , for the time being , she turned her attention to Christopher ; and although he fully comprehended the cause , he none the less enjoyed the effect . He cherished no illusions concerning Elisabeth , for the which he was perhaps to be pitied ; since from love which is founded upon an illusion , there may be an awakening ; but for love which sees its objects as they are , and still goes on loving them , there is no conceivable cure either in this world or the world to come . "
54574	54665	54559	54559	I	0	" she remarked to him one sunny afternoon , when Alan and Felicia had gone off together to Badgering Woods and left her all alone , until Christopher happened to drop in about tea - time . He had a way of appearing upon the scene when Elisabeth needed him , and of effacing himself when she did not . He also had a way of smoothing down all the little faults and trials and difficulties which beset her path , and of making for her the rough places plain . "

54899	54906	54888	54888	I	0	" he added under his breath . "
54914	54923	54888	54888	I	0	" Elisabeth said , rising from her chair ; "
54957	54958	54946	54947	Cousin Maria	100	" "

54983	55034	54946	54947	Cousin Maria	100	" So they went into the garden where they had played as children , and sat down upon the rustic seat where they had sat together scores of times ; and Elisabeth thought about the great mystery of love , and Christopher thought about the length of Elisabeth 's eyelashes . "
55046	55053	55036	55036	you	1553	" the girl asked at last . "
55059	55063	55064	55064	You	1553	" replied Christopher . "

55423	55424	55418	55418	you	125	" "
55435	55440	55418	55418	you	125	" And Christopher sighed . "

55554	55571	55581	55581	he	161	" Christopher could afford to be magnanimous toward Alan , now that Elisabeth was the reverse . "

55623	55627	55629	55629	you	1553	" replied Christopher ; "

55794	55818	55764	55764	she	100	" Christopher was too shy to enjoy talking about himself ; nevertheless , he was immensely pleased when Elisabeth was pleased with him . "
55827	55831	55764	55764	she	100	" he said , "
55861	55868	55858	55859	a lady	3373	" Elisabeth thought for a moment . "
55884	55885	55869	55869	She	1573	" "

56160	56167	56148	56148	people	2982	" Christopher manfully repressed a smile . "
56210	56211	56204	56205	the poet	807	" "
56225	56230	56204	56205	the poet	807	" Elisabeth sagely remarked . "
56265	56266	56267	56273	The people who have been through it	1586	" "
56282	56286	56267	56273	The people who have been through it	1586	" replied Elisabeth . "
56395	56396	56397	56397	She	197	" "
56495	56496	56482	56482	she	197	" "
56510	56514	56498	56498	you	1587	" Christopher asked . "

56649	56731	56643	56643	you	0	" Christopher was amused . Elisabeth was a perfect chef in the preparing of such sops , as he was well aware ; and although he laughed at himself for doing it ( knowing that her present graciousness to him merely meant that she was dull , and wanted somebody to play with , and he was better than nobody ) , he made these sops the principal articles of his heart 's diet , and cared for no other fare . "
56738	56742	56745	56745	he	198	" he inquired . "
56807	56808	56811	56811	they	1607	" "

57460	57461	57464	57464	you	1628	" "
57468	57474	57464	57464	you	1628	" the girl went on ; "

57642	57643	57639	57639	you	1628	" "

57963	57968	57960	57960	one	543	" Christopher smiled sadly . "

58183	58194	58196	58196	you	1628	" Elisabeth added , without attending to the last remark . "
58232	58242	58196	58196	you	1628	" Christopher spoke somewhat bitterly . Elisabeth attended then . "
58279	58280	58273	58273	you	1628	" "
58283	58284	58273	58273	you	1628	" "

58311	58323	58302	58302	you	1628	" replied Christopher with truth , and he added to himself , "
58340	58347	58348	58348	I	0	" Elisabeth stroked his sleeve affectionately . "
58353	58504	58348	58348	I	0	" Christopher winced ; it was when Elisabeth was affectionate that he found his enforced silence most hard to bear . How he could have made her love him if he had tried , he thought ; and how could he find the heart to make her love him as long as he and she were alike dependent upon Miss Farringdon 's bounty , and they had neither anything of their own ? He rejoiced that Alan Tremaine had failed to win her love ; but he scorned him as a fool for not having succeeded in doing so when he had the chance . Had Christopher been master of the Moat House he felt he would have managed things differently ; for the most modest of men cherish a profound contempt for the man who can not succeed in making a woman love him when he sets about it . "
58508	58528	58506	58506	Jove	209	" he said to himself , looking into the gray eyes that were so full of sympathy just then , "
58603	58612	58594	58594	she	1663	" But what he said to Elisabeth was , "
58652	58653	58647	58647	Tremaine	161	" "
58661	58665	58659	58659	Alan	161	" Elisabeth confessed ; "
58706	58707	58691	58691	I	0	" "
58767	58768	58755	58755	you	0	" "

58803	58820	58798	58798	you	0	" replied Christopher , in rather a husky voice , but with a very kindly smile . "
58856	58857	58798	58798	you	0	" "
58886	58907	58877	58877	you	0	" Despise her ? Christopher laughed at the word ; and yet women were supposed to have such keen perceptions . "
58919	58923	58908	58908	I	0	" he said , "
58939	58940	58942	58942	you	0	" "

59195	59199	59183	59183	I	0	" laughed Elisabeth . "
59212	59420	59202	59203	the angels	1667	" Elisabeth laughed again , and looked through the trees to the fields beyond . Friends were much more comfortable than lovers , she said to herself ; Alan in his palmiest days had never been half so soothing to her as Christopher was now . She wondered why poets and people of that kind made so much of love and so little of friendship , since the latter was obviously the more lasting and satisfactory of the two . Somehow the mere presence of Christopher had quite cured the sore feeling that Alan and Felicia had left behind them when they started for their walk without even asking her to go with them ; and she was once more sure of the fact that she was necessary to somebody — a certainty without which Elisabeth could not live . So her imagination took heart of grace again , and began drawing plans for extensive castles in Spain , and arranging social campaigns wherein she herself should be crowned with triumph . She decided that half the delight of winning life 's prizes and meeting its fairy princes would be the telling Christopher all about them afterward ; for her belief in his exhaustless sympathy was boundless . "
59427	59440	59441	59441	I	0	" he said , after she had been silent for some moments . "
59451	59456	59445	59446	Mrs. Bateson	123	" said Elisabeth evasively ; "
59515	59516	59510	59511	Mrs. Bateson	123	" "
59546	59977	59979	59979	Alan	161	" And Elisabeth went to meet the lovers with no longer any little cobwebs of jealousy hiding in the dark corners of her heart , Christopher 's hand having swept them all away ; he had a wonderful power of exterminating the little foxes which would otherwise have spoiled Elisabeth 's vines ; and again she said to herself how much better a thing was friendship than love , since Alan had always expected her to be interested in his concerns , while Christopher , on the contrary , was always interested in hers . It was not long after this that Elisabeth was told by Felicia of the latter 's engagement to Alan Tremaine ; and Elisabeth was amazed at the rapidity with which Felicia had assimilated her lover 's views on all subjects . Elisabeth had expected that her friend would finally sacrifice her opinions on the altar of her feelings ; she was already old enough to be prepared for that ; but she had anticipated a fierce warfare in the soul of Felicia between the directly opposing principles of this young lady 's mother and lover . To Elisabeth 's surprise , this civil war never took place . Felicia accepted Alan 's doubts as unquestioningly as she had formerly accepted Mrs. Herbert 's beliefs ; and as she loved the former more devotedly than she had ever loved the latter , she was more devout and fervid in her agnosticism than she had ever been in her faith . She had believed , because her mother ordered her to believe ; she doubted , because Alan desired her to doubt ; her belief and unbelief being equally the outcome of her affections rather than of her convictions . Mrs. Herbert likewise looked leniently upon Alan 's want of orthodoxy , and at this Elisabeth was not surprised . Possibly there are not many of us who do not — in the private and confidential depths of our evil hearts — regard earth in the hand as worth more than heaven in the bush , so to speak ; at any rate , Felicia 's mother was not one of the bright exceptions ; and — from a purely commercial point of view — a saving faith does not go so far as a spending income , and it is no use pretending that it does . So Mrs. Herbert smiled upon her daughter 's engagement ; but compromised with that accommodating conscience of hers by always speaking of her prospective son - in - law as "
59981	60014	59979	59979	Alan	161	" just as if she really believed , as she professed she did , that the death of the body and the death of the soul are conditions equally to be deplored . "
60021	60047	59979	59979	Alan	161	" she said to Elisabeth , who came to stay at Wood Glen for Felicia 's marriage , which took place in the early summer , "
60090	60111	60083	60083	Alan	161	" Elisabeth , remembering that she had once been fascinated by the master of the Moat House , was merciful . "
60122	60126	60114	60120	an extremely interesting man to talk to	1678	" she said ; "
60135	60136	60137	60137	He	161	" "
60188	60228	60230	60230	he	161	" agreed Mrs. Herbert , who would cheerfully have poured out all the vials of the Book of Revelation upon any impecunious doubter who had dared to add the mortal sin of poverty to the venial one of unbelief . "
60236	60240	60230	60230	he	161	" Elisabeth continued ; "
60278	60279	60314	60315	the elect	1683	" "
60339	60372	60375	60375	I	0	" Mrs. Herbert had dismissed a kitchen - maid , only the week before , for declining to attend her Bible - class , and walking out with a young man instead . "
60386	60390	60375	60375	I	0	" Elisabeth persisted ; "
60431	60432	60433	60433	My	0	" "
60492	60521	60489	60490	Saint Paul	129	" Elisabeth sighed . She had long ago become acquainted with Mrs. Herbert 's custom of keeping religion as a thing apart , and of treating it from an "
60533	60581	60582	60582	Felicia	154	" point of view ; and she felt that Tremaine 's open agnosticism was almost better — and certainly more sincere — than this . But Mrs. Herbert was utterly unconscious of any secret fault on her own part , and continued to purr contentedly to herself . "
60702	60757	60758	60758	I	0	" And the mother 's cup of happiness ran over at the mere thought of such honour and glory . Felicia , too , was radiantly happy . In the first place , she was very much in love ; in the second , her world was praising her for doing well to herself . "
60780	60792	60767	60767	Alan	161	" she said to Elisabeth , not long before the wedding . "
60828	60829	60818	60818	you	0	" "
60840	60876	60877	60877	I	0	" Elisabeth was too well - mannered to smile at this ; but she made a note of it to report to Christopher afterward . She knew that he would understand how funny it was . "
60886	60890	60877	60877	I	0	" Felicia continued ; "
60931	60932	60953	60953	Felicia	154	" "
60955	60956	60957	60957	Elisabeth	102	" "
61067	61340	61036	61036	I	0	" Elisabeth shrugged her shoulders ; the honours that have been within our reach are never quite so wonderful as those that have not . So Alan and Felicia were married with much rejoicing and ringing of bells ; and Elisabeth found it very pleasant to have her old schoolfellow settled at the Moat House . In fact so thoroughly did she throw herself into the interests of Felicia 's new home , that she ceased to feel her need of Christopher , and consequently neglected him somewhat . It was only when others failed her that he was at a premium ; when she found she could do without him , she did . As for him , he loyally refrained from blaming Elisabeth , even in his heart , and cursed Fate instead ; which really was unfair of him , considering that in this matter Elisabeth , and not Fate , was entirely to blame . But Christopher was always ready to find excuses for Elisabeth , whatever she might do ; and this , it must be confessed , required no mean order of ingenuity just then . Elisabeth was as yet young enough to think lightly of the gifts that were bestowed upon her freely and with no trouble on her part , such as bread and air and sunshine and the like ; it was reserved for her to learn later that the things one takes for granted are the best thing life has to offer . It must also be remembered , for her justification , that Christopher had never told her that he loved her "
61344	61498	61499	61499	She	1708	" ; and it is difficult for women to believe that any man loves them until he has told them so , just as it is difficult for them to believe that a train is going direct to the place appointed to it in Bradshaw , until they have been verbally assured upon the point by two guards , six porters , and a newspaper boy . Nevertheless , Elisabeth 's ignorance — though perhaps excusable , considering her sex — was anything but bliss to poor Christopher , and her good - natured carelessness hurt him none the less for her not knowing that it hurt him . When Felicia had been married about three months her mother came to stay with her at the Moat House ; and Elisabeth smiled to herself — and to Christopher — as she pictured the worthy woman 's delight in her daughter 's new surroundings . "
61515	61519	61521	61521	she	1708	" Elisabeth said , "
61580	61581	61571	61571	she	197	" "
61589	61606	61587	61587	you	1711	" Christopher replied , with the smile that was always ready for Elisabeth 's feeblest sallies , "
61631	61632	61626	61626	you	1711	" "
61797	61798	61795	61795	Christopher	121	" "
61820	61821	61808	61808	I	0	" "
61828	61837	61824	61824	I	0	" replied Elisabeth , whipping up her pony , "
61876	62160	62161	62161	I	0	" And Christopher — who had met her in the High Street — smiled after the retreating figure in sheer delight at her . How fresh and bright and spontaneous she was , he thought , and how charmingly ignorant of the things which she prided herself upon understanding so profoundly ! He laughed aloud as he recalled how very wise Elisabeth considered herself . And then he wondered if life would teach her to be less sure of her own buoyant strength , and less certain of her ultimate success in everything she undertook ; and , if it did , he felt that he should have an ugly account to settle with life . He was willing for Fate to knock him about as much and as hardly as she pleased , provided she would let Elisabeth alone , and allow the girl to go on believing in herself and enjoying herself as she was so abundantly capable of doing . By this time Christopher was enough of a philosopher to think that it did not really matter much in the long run whether he were happy or unhappy ; but he was not yet able to regard the thought of Elisabeth 's unhappiness as anything but a catastrophe of the most insupportable magnitude ; which showed that he had not yet sufficient philosophy to go round . When Elisabeth arrived at the Moat House she found Mrs. Herbert alone , Felicia having gone out driving with her husband ; and , to Elisabeth 's surprise , there was no sign of the jubilation which she had anticipated . On the contrary , Mrs. Herbert was subdued and tired - looking . "
62172	62179	62161	62161	I	0	" she said , kissing Elisabeth ; "
62191	62192	62189	62189	myself	0	" "
62203	62211	62189	62189	myself	0	" Elisabeth replied , returning her salute . "
62265	62266	62233	62233	they	1724	" "
62275	62360	62233	62233	they	1724	" agreed Mrs. Herbert listlessly . Elisabeth wondered what was wrong , but she did not ask ; she knew that Mrs. Herbert would confide in her very soon . People very rarely were reserved with Elisabeth ; she was often amazed at the rapidity with which they opened their inmost hearts to her . Probably this accounted in some measure for her slowness in understanding Christopher , who had made it a point of honour not to open his inmost heart to her . "
62368	62379	62380	62380	I	0	" she said cheerfully , pretending not to notice anything . "
62475	62476	62504	62504	I	0	" "
62488	62489	62490	62490	I	0	" "
62535	62542	62570	62571	Mrs. Herbert	197	" Mrs. Herbert 's lip trembled . "
62563	62564	62555	62555	Felicia	154	" "
62669	62690	62661	62661	he	161	" But even then Mrs. Herbert did not smile ; instead of that her light blue eyes filled with tears . "
62696	62707	62661	62661	he	161	" she said , with a sob in her voice , "
62714	62749	62708	62708	Felicia	154	" For all her high spirits , Elisabeth generally recognised tragedy when she met it face to face ; and she knew that she was meeting it now . So she spoke very gently — "
62784	62785	62757	62757	you	197	" "
62854	62897	62836	62836	I	0	" And the tears overflowed , and rolled down Mrs. Herbert 's faded cheeks . Elisabeth 's heart swelled with an immense pity , for her quick insight told her that Mrs. Herbert was not mistaken ; but all she said was — "
62955	62972	62948	62948	they	1745	" Mrs. Herbert shook her head sorrowfully ; her tongue was loosed and she spake plain . "
63082	63083	63074	63074	she	154	" "
63101	63102	63096	63096	You	1749	" "
63279	63316	63262	63262	I	0	" And the big tears rolled down faster than ever . Elisabeth did not know what to say ; so she wisely said nothing , but took Mrs. Herbert 's hand in hers and stroked it . "
63345	63346	63353	63354	Mrs. Herbert	197	" "
63397	63398	63389	63389	He	105	" "
63445	63446	63436	63436	I	0	" "
63453	63454	63450	63450	you	0	" "
63607	63627	63628	63629	Grand people	1776	" Elisabeth 's eyes filled with tears ; and Mrs. Herbert , encouraged by her unspoken sympathy , proceeded — "
63767	63768	63765	63765	Elisabeth	102	" "
63779	63780	63775	63775	God	105	" "
63794	63795	63784	63784	you	1782	" "
63814	63815	63811	63812	Mrs. Herbert	197	" "
63964	63992	63993	63993	My	0	" And Mrs. Herbert covered her face with her hands and burst out into bitter sobs . Elisabeth took the weeping form into her strong young arms . "
64080	64119	64120	64120	they	1801	" she continued , as the memory of Christopher 's unfailing patience with her suddenly came into her mind , and she recalled how often she had hurt him , and how readily he had always forgiven her ; "
64161	64200	64201	64202	My dear	3103	" So does the love of the brother whom we have seen help us in some measure to understand the love of the God Whom we have not seen ; for which we owe the brother eternal thanks . "
64204	64218	64201	64202	My dear	3103	" said Miss Farringdon , when Elisabeth came down one morning to breakfast , "
64227	64280	64201	64202	My dear	3103	" Miss Farringdon was never late in a morning . She regarded early rising as a virtue on a par with faith and charity ; while to appear at the breakfast - table after the breakfast itself had already appeared thereon was , in her eyes , as the sin of witchcraft . "
64286	64330	64201	64202	My dear	3103	" asked Elisabeth , somewhat breathlessly . She had run downstairs at full speed in order to enter the dining - room before the dishes , completing her toilet as she fled ; and she had only beaten the bacon by a neck . "
64349	64350	64339	64339	Christopher	121	" "
64382	64383	64384	64384	I	0	" "
64456	64457	64458	64459	Poor Christopher	121	" "
64469	64470	64461	64461	I	0	" "
64545	65079	65085	65085	you	1817	" Miss Farringdon sighed . She had spent most of her life in the wilderness and on the mountain - tops , and she knew how cold was the climate and how dreary the prospect there . Elisabeth 's eyes filled with tears , and her heart swelled with a strange new feeling she had never felt before . For the first time in her life Christopher ( unconsciously on his part ) made a direct appeal to her pity , and her heart responded to the appeal . His perspective , from her point of view , was suddenly changed ; he was no longer the kindly , easy - going comrade with whom she had laughed and quarrelled and made it up again ever since she could remember , and with whom she was on a footing of such familiar intimacy ; instead , he had become a man standing in the shadow of a great sorrow , whose solitary grief commanded her respect and at the same time claimed her tenderness . All through breakfast , and the prayers which followed , Elisabeth 's thoughts ran on this new Christopher , who was so much more interesting and yet so much farther off than the old one . She wondered how he would look and what he would say when next she saw him ; and she longed to see him again , and yet felt frightened at the thought of doing so . At prayers that morning Miss Farringdon read the lament of David over Saul and Jonathan ; and while the words of undying pathos sounded in her ears , Elisabeth wondered whether Christopher would mourn as David did if his uncle were to die , and whether he would let her comfort him . When prayers were over , Miss Farringdon bade Elisabeth accompany her to Mr. Smallwood 's ; and all the way there the girl 's heart was beating so fast that it almost choked her , with mingled fear of and tenderness for this new Christopher who had taken the place of her old playmate . As they sat waiting for him in the oak - panelled dining - room , a fresh wave of pity swept over Elisabeth as she realized for the first time — though she had sat there over and over again — what a cheerless home this was in which to spend one 's childhood and youth , and how pluckily Christopher had always made the best of things , and had never confessed — even to her — what a dreary lot was his . Then he came downstairs ; and as she heard his familiar footstep crossing the hall her heart beat faster than ever , and there was a mist before her eyes ; but when he entered the room and shook hands , first with Miss Farringdon and then with her , she was quite surprised to see that he looked very much as he always looked , only his face was pale and his eyes heavy for want of sleep ; and his smile was as kind as ever as it lighted upon her . "
65093	65105	65085	65085	you	1817	" he said , addressing Miss Farringdon but looking at Elisabeth . "
65112	65117	65110	65110	Christopher	121	" replied Miss Maria ; "
65183	65184	65185	65185	You	0	" "
65190	65221	65185	65185	You	0	" And Christopher 's voice shook a little . Elisabeth did not speak . She was struggling with a feeling of uncontrollable shyness which completely tied her usually fluent tongue . "
65227	65232	65185	65185	You	0	" Miss Farringdon asked . "
65235	65239	65185	65185	You	0	" Christopher replied , "
65296	65297	65298	65298	I	0	" "
65332	65430	65443	65443	his	1829	" Christopher did not answer . There suddenly rushed over him the memory of all that his uncle had been to him , and of how that uncle still treated him as a little child ; and with it came the consciousness that , when his uncle was gone , nobody would ever treat him as a little child any more . Life is somewhat dreary when the time comes for us to be grown - up to everybody ; so Christopher looked ( and did not see ) out of the window , instead of speaking . "
65434	65439	65443	65443	his	1829	" Miss Farringdon continued , "
65619	66069	66070	66070	Chris	125	" And Miss Farringdon took off her spectacles and wiped them . There was silence for a few seconds , while Christopher manfully struggled with his feelings and Miss Maria decorously gave vent to hers . Christopher was vexed with himself for so nearly breaking down before Elisabeth , and throwing the shadow of his sorrow across the sunshine of her path . He did not know that the mother - heart in her was yearning over him with a tenderness almost too powerful to be resisted , and that his weakness was constraining her as his strength had never done . He was rather surprised that she did not speak to him ; but with the patient simplicity of a strong man he accepted her behaviour without questioning it . Her mere presence in the room somehow changed everything , and made him feel that no world which contained Elisabeth could ever be an entirely sorrowful world . Of course he knew nothing about the new Christopher which had suddenly arisen above Elisabeth 's horizon ; he was far too masculine to understand that his own pathos could be pathetic , or his own suffering dramatic . It is only women — or men who have much of the woman in their composition — who can say : The thoroughly manly man is incapable of seeing the picturesque effect of his own misery . So Christopher pulled himself together and tried to talk of trivial things ; and Miss Farringdon , having walked through the dark valley herself , knew the comfort of the commonplace therein , and fell in with his mood , discussing nurses and remedies and domestic arrangements and the like . Elisabeth , however , was distinctly disappointed in Christopher , because he could bring himself down to dwell upon these trifling matters when the Angel of Death had crossed the lintel of his doorway only last night , and was still hovering round with overshadowing wings . It was just like him , she said to herself , to give his attention to surface details , and to miss the deeper thing . She had yet to learn that it was because he felt so much , and not because he felt so little , that Christopher found it hard to utter the inmost thoughts of his heart . But when Miss Farringdon had made every possible arrangement for Mr. Smallwood 's comfort , and they rose to leave , Elisabeth 's heart smote her for her passing impatience ; so she lingered behind after her cousin had left the room , and , slipping her hand into Christopher 's , she whispered — "
66080	66257	66070	66070	Chris	125	" It was a poor little speech for the usually eloquent Elisabeth to make ; in cold blood she herself would have been ashamed of it ; but Christopher was quite content . For a second he forgot that he had decided not to let Elisabeth know that he loved her until he was in a position to marry her , and he very nearly took her in his strong arms and kissed her there and then ; but before he had time to do this , his good angel ( or perhaps his bad one , for it is often difficult to ascertain how one 's two guardian spirits divide their work ) reminded him that it was his duty to leave Elisabeth free to live her own life , unhampered by the knowledge of a love which might possibly find no fulfilment in this world where money is considered the one thing needful ; so he merely returned the pressure of her hand , and said in a queer , strained sort of voice — "
66279	67145	66273	66273	he	1837	" And Elisabeth also was content . Contrary to the doctor 's expectations , Richard Smallwood did not die : he had lost all power of thought or speech , and never regained them , but lived on for years a living corpse ; and the burden of his illness lay heavily on Christopher 's young shoulders . Life was specially dark to poor Christopher just then . His uncle 's utter break - down effectually closed the door on all chances of escape from the drudgery of the Osierfield to a higher and wider sphere ; for , until now , he had continued to hope against hope that he might induce that uncle to start him in some other walk of life , where the winning of Elisabeth would enter into the region of practical politics . But now all chance of this was over ; Richard Smallwood was beyond the reach of the entreaties and arguments which hitherto he had so firmly resisted . There was nothing left for Christopher to do but to step into his uncle 's shoes , and try to make the best of his life as general manager of the Osierfield , handicapped still further by the charge of that uncle , which made it impossible for him to dream of bringing home a wife to the big old house in the High Street . There was only one drop of sweetness in the bitterness of his cup — one ray of light in the darkness of his outlook ; and that was the consciousness that he could still go on seeing and loving and serving Elisabeth , although he might never be able to tell her he was doing so . He hoped that she would understand ; but here he was too sanguine ; Elisabeth was as yet incapable of comprehending any emotion until she had seen it reduced to a prescription . So Christopher lived on in the gloomy house , and looked after his uncle as tenderly as a mother looks after a sick child . To all intents and purposes Richard was a child again ; he could not speak or think , but he still loved his nephew , the only one of his own flesh and blood ; and he smiled like a child every time that Christopher came into his room , and cried like a child ever ; time that Christopher went away . Elisabeth was very sorry for Christopher at first , and very tender toward him ; but after a time the coldness , which he felt it his duty to show toward her in the changed state of affairs , had its natural effect , and she decided that it was foolish to waste her sympathy upon any one who obviously needed and valued it so little . Moreover , she had not forgotten that strange , new feeling which disturbed her heart the morning after Mr. Smallwood was taken ill ; and she experienced , half unconsciously , a thoroughly feminine resentment against the man who had called into being such an emotion , and then apparently had found no use for it . So Elisabeth in her heart of hearts was at war with Christopher — that slumbering , smouldering sort of warfare which is ready to break out into fire and battle at the slightest provocation ; and this state of affairs did not tend to make life any the easier for him . He felt he could have cheerfully borne it all if only Elisabeth had been kind and had understood ; but Elisabeth did not understand him in the least , and was consequently unkind — far more unkind than she , in her careless , light - hearted philosophy , dreamed of . She , too , had her disappointments to bear just then . The artist - soul in her had grown up , and was crying out for expression ; and she vainly prayed her cousin to let her go to the Slade School , and there learn to develop the power that was in her . But Miss Farringdon belonged to the generation which regarded art purely as a recreation — such as fancy - work , croquet , and the like — and she considered that young women should be trained for the more serious things of life ; by which she meant the ordering of suitable dinners for the rich and the manufacturing of seemly garments for the poor . So Elisabeth had to endure the agony which none but an artist can know — the agony of being dumb when one has an angel - whispered secret to tell forth — of being bound hand and foot when one has a God - sent message to write upon the wall . Now and then Miss Maria took her young cousin up to town for a few weeks , and thus Elisabeth came to have a bowing acquaintanceship with London ; but of London as an ever - fascinating , never - wearying friend she knew nothing . There are people who tell us that "
67153	67156	66273	66273	he	1837	" and that "
67166	67185	67186	67188	a pleasant person	1839	" and we smile at them as a man would smile at those who said that his mother was "
67190	67196	67197	67199	a charming girl	1840	" or his heart 's dearest "
67201	67520	67197	67199	a charming girl	1840	" Those who know London and the country , as London and the country deserve to be known , do not talk in this way , for they have learned that there is no end to the wonder or the interest or the mystery of either . The year following Richard Smallwood 's break - down , a new interest came into Elisabeth 's life . A son and heir was born at the Moat House ; and Elisabeth was one of the women who are predestined to the worship of babies . Very tightly did the tiny fingers twine themselves round her somewhat empty heart ; for Elisabeth was meant to love much , and at present her supply of the article was greatly in excess of the demand made upon it . So she poured the surplus — which no one else seemed to need — upon the innocent head of Felicia 's baby ; and she found that the baby never misjudged her nor disappointed her , as older people seemed so apt to do . One of her most devout fellow - worshippers was Mrs. Herbert , who derived comfort from the fact that little Willie was not ashamed of her as little Willie 's mother was ; so — like many a disappointed woman before them — both Mrs. Herbert and Elisabeth discovered the healing power which lies in the touch of a baby 's hand . Felicia loved the child , too , in her way ; but she was of the type of woman to whom the husband is always dearer than the children . But Alan 's cup was filled to overflowing , and he loved his son as he loved his own soul . One of Christopher 's expedients for hiding the meditations of his heart from Elisabeth 's curious eyes was the discussion with her of what people call "
67523	67670	67671	67671	I	0	" ; and this tried her temper to the utmost . She regarded it as a sign of superficiality to talk of superficial things ; and she hardly ever went in to dinner with a man without arriving at the discussion of abstract love and the second entrée simultaneously . It had never yet dawned upon her that as a rule it is because one has not experienced a feeling that one is able to describe it ; she reasoned in the contrary direction , and came to the conclusion that those persons have no hearts at all whose sleeves are unadorned with the same . Therefore it was intolerable to her when Christopher — who had played with her as a child , and had once very nearly made her grow up into a woman — talked to her about the contents of the newspapers . "
67678	67707	67671	67671	I	0	" she answered crossly one day , in reply to some unexceptionable and uninteresting comment of his upon such history as was just then in the raw material ; "
67712	67713	67708	67708	I	0	" "
67720	67728	67716	67716	you	0	" Christopher was surprised at her vehemence . "
67757	67792	67708	67708	I	0	" Elisabeth had all the pity of a thoroughly healthy person for the suffering that could not touch her , and the unreasoning terror of a thoroughly healthy person for the suffering which could . "
67803	67813	67708	67708	I	0	" said Christopher , in his most comforting tone ; "
67868	67869	67864	67864	I	0	" "
67874	67901	67864	67864	I	0	" Elisabeth was at war with him , but she was not insensible to the consolation he never failed to afford her when things went wrong . "

67970	67979	67962	67962	I	0	" said Elisabeth confidentially . Christopher was puzzled . "

68387	68388	68393	68393	they	1855	" "
68414	68608	68393	68393	they	1855	" Elisabeth was comforted ; and she never knew that Christopher did not leave the house that day without asking Miss Farringdon if , for a few weeks , the daily paper might be delivered at the works and sent up to the Willows afterward , as he wanted to see the trade - reports the first thing in the morning . This was done ; and sometimes Christopher remembered to send the papers on to the house , and sometimes he did not . On these latter occasions Miss Farringdon severely reproved him , and told him that he would never be as capable a man as his uncle had been , if he did not endeavour to cultivate his memory ; whereat Chris was inwardly tickled , but was outwardly very penitent and apologetic , promising to try to be less forgetful in future . And he kept his word ; for not once — while the epidemic in the South of France lasted — did he forget to forget to send the newspaper up to the Willows when there was anything in it calculated to alarm the most timid reader . "
68612	68622	68609	68610	Cousin Maria	100	" said Elisabeth , a few days after this , "
68643	68658	68660	68660	you	0	" Miss Farringdon looked up over the tops of her gold - rimmed spectacles . "
68709	68748	68749	68749	Christopher	121	" It is always interesting to note where people draw the line between right and wrong in dealing with forms of amusement ; and it is doubtful whether two separate lines are ever quite identical in their curves . "
68754	68758	68761	68761	he	121	" Elisabeth continued ; "
68771	68772	68768	68768	Alan	161	" "
68812	69216	69217	69217	I	0	" Elisabeth laughed her cousin to scorn . She did not want anybody to take care of her , she thought ; she was perfectly able to take care of herself . But Miss Farringdon belonged to a time when single women of forty were supposed to require careful supervision ; and Elisabeth was but four - and - twenty . Christopher , when consulted , fell into the arrangement with alacrity ; and it was arranged for him to take Elisabeth over to Burlingham on the one day that Coulson 's circus was on exhibition there . Elisabeth looked forward to the treat like a child ; for she was by nature extremely fond of pleasure , and by circumstance little accustomed to it . Great then was her disappointment when the morning of the day arrived , to receive a short note from Christopher saying that he was extremely sorry to inconvenience her , but that his business engagements made it impossible for him to take her to Burlingham that day ; and adding various apologies and hopes that she would not be too angry with him . She had so few treats that her disappointment at losing one was really acute for the moment ; but what hurt her far more than the disappointment was the consciousness that Chris had obeyed the calls of business rather than her behest — had thought less of her pleasure than of the claims of the Osierfield . All Elisabeth 's pride ( or was it her vanity ? ) rose up in arms at the slight which Christopher had thus put upon her ; and she felt angrier with him than she had ever felt with anybody in her life before . She began to pour out the vials of her wrath in the presence of Miss Farringdon ; but that good lady was so much pleased to find a young man who cared more for business than for pleasure , or even for a young woman , that she accorded Elisabeth but scant sympathy . So Elisabeth possessed her wounded soul in extreme impatience , until such time as the offender himself should appear upon the scene , ready to receive those vials which had been specially prepared for his destruction . He duly appeared about tea - time , and found Elisabeth consuming the smoke of her anger in the garden . "
69227	69245	69219	69219	you	1863	" he began in a humble tone , sitting down beside her on the old rustic seat ; "
69291	69292	69293	69293	I	0	" "
69306	69322	69293	69293	I	0	" replied Elisabeth , flashing a pair of very bright eyes upon his discomfited face ; "
69356	69361	69362	69362	Elisabeth	102	" Christopher was startled . "
69376	69377	69372	69372	you	0	" "
69459	69560	69566	69566	you	0	" Christopher looked utterly astonished . He had no idea , he said to himself , that Elisabeth cared so much about going to Coulson 's circus ; and he could not see anything in the frustration of a day 's excursion to account for such a storm of indignation as this . He did not realize that it was the rage of a monarch whose kingdom was in a state of rebellion , and whose dominion seemed in danger of slipping away altogether . Elisabeth might not understand Christopher ; but Christopher was not always guiltless of misunderstanding Elisabeth . "
69568	69573	69566	69566	you	0	" Elisabeth went on , "
69663	69664	69643	69643	He	161	" "
69701	69702	69684	69684	I	0	" "
69713	69714	69704	69704	you	0	" "
69761	69771	69748	69748	I	0	" But Elisabeth was too angry to be flippant . "
69796	69797	69787	69787	I	0	" "
69834	69855	69823	69823	You	0	" Christopher was as determined to treat the quarrel lightly as Elisabeth was to deal with it on serious grounds . "
69889	69890	69906	69906	You	0	" "
69935	69941	69931	69933	Miss Elisabeth Farringdon	102	" Elisabeth stamped her foot . "

70027	70028	70008	70008	you	0	" "
70038	70046	70047	70047	My	0	" Christopher was unwise enough to laugh . "
70075	70087	70089	70089	you	0	" Then Elisabeth 's anger settled down into the quiet stage . "
70117	70118	70113	70113	I	0	" "
70139	70157	70163	70163	you	0	" The laughter had entirely died out of Christopher 's face , and his voice was hoarse . "
70216	70229	70230	70230	You	0	" Christopher rose from his seat ; he was serious enough now . "
70253	70272	70230	70230	You	0	" For a second the misery on his face penetrated the thunder - clouds of Elisabeth 's indignation . "
70283	70316	70320	70320	you	102	" she asked . It seemed brutal — even to her outraged feelings — to send so old a friend empty away . Christopher 's smile was very bitter as he answered . "
70363	70624	70355	70355	I	0	" And he turned on his heel and left her . As she watched his retreating figure , one spasm of remorse shot through Elisabeth 's heart ; but it was speedily stifled by the recollection that , for the first time in her life , Christopher had failed her , and had shown her plainly that there were , in his eyes , more important matters than Miss Elisabeth Farringdon and her whims and fancies . And what woman , worthy of the name , could extend mercy to a man who had openly displayed so flagrant a want of taste and discernment as this ? Certainly not Elisabeth , nor any other fashioned after her pattern . She felt that she had as much right to be angry as had the prophet , when Almighty Wisdom saw fit to save the great city in which he was not particularly interested , and to destroy the gourd in which he was . And so , probably , she had . For several days after this she kept clear of Christopher , nursing her anger in her heart ; and he was so hurt and sore from the lashing which her tongue had given him , that he felt no inclination to come within the radius of that tongue 's bitterness again . But one day , when Elisabeth was sitting on the floor of the Moat House drawing - room , playing with the baby and discussing new gowns with Felicia between times , Alan came in and remarked — "
70700	70734	70677	70677	you	1874	" Elisabeth ceased from her free translation of the baby 's gurglings and her laudable endeavours suitably to reply to the same , and gave her whole attention to the baby 's father . "
70753	70754	70749	70749	you	0	" "
70760	70764	70757	70757	you	1874	" replied Alan , "
70886	70887	70890	70890	me	0	" "
70922	70923	70890	70890	me	0	" "
71076	71786	71789	71789	Chris	125	" And then Alan proceeded to expound his views on the matter of sanitary authorities in general and of those of Burlingham in particular , to which Felicia listened with absorbing attention and Elisabeth did not listen at all . Soon after this she took her leave ; and all along the homeward walk through Badgering Woods she was conscious of feeling ashamed of herself — a very rare sensation with Elisabeth , and by no means an agreeable one . She was by nature so self - reliant and so irresponsible that she seldom regretted anything that she had done ; if she had acted wisely , all was well ; and if she had not acted wisely , it was over and done with , and what was the use of bothering any more about it ? This was her usual point of view , and it proved as a rule a most comfortable one . But now she could not fail to see that she had been in the wrong — hopelessly and flagrantly in the wrong — and that she had behaved abominably to Christopher into the bargain . She had to climb down , as other ruling powers have had to climb down before now ; and the act of climbing down is neither a becoming nor an exhilarating form of exercise to ruling powers . But at the back of her humble contrition there was a feeling of gladness in the knowledge that Christopher had not really failed her after all , and that her kingdom was still her own as it had been in her childish days ; and there was also a nobler feeling of higher joy in the consciousness that — quite apart from his attitude toward her — Christopher was still the Christopher that she had always in her inmost soul believed him to be ; that she was not wrong in the idea she had formed of him long ago . It is very human to be glad on our own account when people are as fond of us as we expected them to be ; but it is divine to be glad , solely for their sakes , when they act up to their own ideals , quite apart from us . And there was a touch of divinity in Elisabeth 's gladness just then , though the rest of her was extremely human — and feminine at that . On her way home she encountered Caleb Bateson going back to work after dinner , and she told him to ask Mr. Thornley to come up to the Willows that afternoon , as she wanted to see him . She preferred to send a verbal message , as by so doing she postponed for a few hours that climbing - down process which she so much disliked ; although it is frequently easier to climb down by means of one 's pen than by means of one 's tongue . Christopher felt no pleasure in receiving her message . He was not angry with her , although he marvelled at the unreasonableness and injustice of a sex that thinks more of a day 's pleasure than a life 's devotion ; he did not know that it was over the life 's devotion and not the day 's pleasure that Elisabeth had fought so hard that day ; but his encounter with her had strangely tired him , and taken the zest out of his life , and he had no appetite for any more of such disastrous and inglorious warfare . But he obeyed her mandate all the same , having learned the important political lesson that the fact of a Government 's being in the wrong is no excuse for not obeying the orders of that Government ; and he waited for her in the drawing - room at the Willows , looking out toward the sunset and wondering how hard upon him Elisabeth was going to be . And his thoughts were so full of her that he did not hear her come into the room until she clasped both her hands round his arm and looked up into his gloomy face , saying — "
71799	71819	71791	71791	I	0	" The clouds were dispelled at once , and Christopher smiled as he had not smiled for a week . "
71823	71836	71791	71791	I	0	" he said , patting the hands that were on his arm ; "
71842	71860	71791	71791	I	0	" But Elisabeth , having set out upon the descent , was prepared to climb down handsomely . "
71888	71889	71894	71894	you	125	" "
71936	71937	71939	71939	me	0	" "

71980	71981	71974	71974	I	0	" "
71989	71999	71974	71974	I	0	" And Elisabeth was nearer the mark than Christopher . "
72025	72101	72006	72006	you	125	" replied Chris , forgetting how very unreasonable her anger had seemed only five minutes ago . But five minutes can make such a difference — sometimes . Elisabeth cheerfully caught at this straw of comfort ; she was always ready to take a lenient view of her own shortcomings . If Christopher had been wise he would not have encouraged such leniency ; but who is wise and in love at the same time ? "
72112	72116	72110	72110	you	125	" she admitted ; "
72151	72161	72139	72139	you	125	" A little quiver crept into Christopher 's voice . "
72173	72174	72177	72177	I	0	" "
72189	72196	72183	72183	I	0	" agreed Elisabeth with some truth . "
72208	72209	72201	72201	you	125	" "
72231	72237	72211	72211	I	0	" Christopher hastened to add ; "
72259	72260	72249	72249	you	125	" "
72280	72281	72277	72277	Chris	125	" "
72289	72293	72294	72294	Alan	161	" Chris asked . "
72310	72311	72294	72294	Alan	161	" "
72348	72349	72321	72321	he	161	" "
72380	72397	72371	72371	I	0	" Elisabeth was the type of woman for whom the confessional will always have its fascinations . "
72418	72419	72410	72410	you	125	" "
72426	72427	72421	72421	you	125	" "
72477	72485	72474	72474	you	125	" Elisabeth stroked his coat sleeve affectionately . "
72523	72524	72516	72516	I	0	" "
72556	72628	72630	72630	you	125	" To Christopher remorse for wrong done would always be an agony ; he had yet to learn that to some temperaments , whereof Elisabeth 's was one , it partook of the nature of a luxury — the sort of luxury which tempts one to pay half a guinea to be allowed to swell up one 's eyes and redden one 's nose over imaginary woes in a London theatre . "
72640	72668	72630	72630	you	125	" Elisabeth asked thoughtfully . Christopher was torn between a loyal wish to do homage to his idol and a laudable desire to save that idol pain . "
72683	72684	72630	72630	you	125	" "
72724	72725	72726	72726	I	0	" "
72773	72774	72762	72762	I	0	" "
72785	72789	72762	72762	I	0	" persisted Elisabeth . "
72834	72835	72820	72820	you	125	" "
72844	72848	72820	72820	you	125	" Elisabeth coaxed . "
72937	72938	72939	72939	I	0	" "
72975	72981	72970	72971	the professor	1902	" Christopher shook his head . "

72997	72998	72970	72971	the professor	1902	" "
73019	73034	73000	73000	I	0	" During the following winter Miss Farringdon gave unmistakable signs of that process known as "
73039	73419	73000	73000	I	0	" She had fought a good fight for many years , and the time was fast coming for her to lay down her arms and receive her reward . Elisabeth , with her usual light - heartedness , did not see the Shadow stealing nearer day by day ; but Christopher was more accustomed to shadows than she was — his path had lain chiefly among them — and he knew what was coming , and longed passionately and in vain to shield Elisabeth from the inevitable . He had played the part of Providence to her in one matter : he had stood between her and himself , and had prevented her from drinking of that mingled cup of sweetness and bitterness which men call Love , thinking that she would be a happier woman if she left untasted the only form of the beverage which he was able to offer her . And possibly he was right ; that she would be also a better woman in consequence , was quite another and more doubtful side of the question . But now the part of Elisabeth 's Providence was no longer cast for Christopher to play ; he might prevent Love with his sorrows from coming nigh her dwelling , but Death defied his protecting arm . It was good for Elisabeth to be afflicted , although Christopher would willingly have died to save her a moment 's pain ; and it is a blessed thing for us after all that Perfect Wisdom and Almighty Power are one . As usual Elisabeth was so busy straining her eyes after the ideal that the real escaped her notice ; and it was therefore a great shock to her when her Cousin Maria went to sleep one night in a land whose stones are of iron , and awoke next morning in a country whose pavements are of gold . For a time the girl was completely stunned by the blow ; and during that period Christopher was very good to her . Afterward — when he and she had drifted far apart — Elisabeth sometimes recalled Christopher 's sheltering care during the first dark days of her loneliness ; and she never did so without remembering the words , "
73427	73641	73000	73000	I	0	" ; they seemed to express all that he was to her just then . When Maria Farringdon 's will was read , it was found that she had left to her cousin and adopted daughter , Elisabeth , an annuity of five hundred a year ; also the income from the Osierfield and the Willows until such time as the real owner of these estates should be found . The rest of her property — together with the Osierfield and the Willows — she bequeathed upon trust for the eldest living son , if any , of her late cousin George Farringdon ; and she appointed Richard Smallwood and his nephew to be her trustees and executors . The trustees were required to ascertain whether George Farringdon had left any son , and whether that son was still alive ; but if , at the expiration of ten years from the death of the testator , no such son could be discovered , the whole of Miss Farringdon 's estate was to become the absolute property of Elisabeth . As since the making of this will Richard had lost his faculties , the whole responsibility of finding the lost heir and of looking after the temporary heiress devolved upon Christopher 's shoulders . "

74035	74043	74027	74027	They	1917	" And she shook her head disapprovingly . "

75414	75556	75375	75375	I	0	" On the afternoon of that very Sunday Christopher took Elisabeth for a walk in Badgering Woods . The winter was departing , and a faint pink flush on the bare trees heralded the coming of spring ; and Elisabeth , being made of material which is warranted not to fret for long , began to feel that life was not altogether dark , and that it was just possible she might — at the end of many years — actually enjoy things again . Further , Christopher suited her perfectly — how perfectly she did not know as yet — and she spent much time with him just then . Those of us who have ever guessed the acrostics in a weekly paper , have learned that sometimes we find a solution to one of the lights , and say , "
75572	75714	75717	75717	you	1967	" ; and at other times we chance upon an answer which we know at once , without further research , to be indisputably the right one . It is so with other things than acrostics : there are friends whom we feel will do very well for us if nobody — or until somebody — better turns up ; and there are others whom we know to be just the right people for the particular needs of our souls at that time . They are the right answers to the questions which have been perplexing us — the correct solutions to the problems over which we have been puzzling our brains . So it was with Elisabeth : Christopher was the correct answer to life 's current acrostic ; and as long as she was with Christopher she was content . "
75731	75746	75749	75749	you	1967	" she asked him , as they sat upon a stile in Badgering Woods . "
75769	75796	75797	75797	I	0	" Christopher was pleased to find Elisabeth facing life 's abstract problems again ; it proved that she was no longer overpowered by its concrete ones . "
75806	75817	75797	75797	I	0	" she replied , looking dreamily through the leafless trees ; "
75864	75865	75866	75866	I	0	" "

76348	76352	76328	76328	You	1980	" continued he ; "
76362	76712	76354	76354	me	0	" And while he turned up the fur collar of her coat and hooked the highest hook and eye , Elisabeth thought how nice it was to be petted and taken care of ; and as she walked homeward by Christopher 's side , she felt like a good little girl again . Even reigning monarchs now and then like to have their ermine tucked round them , and to be patted on their crowns by a protecting hand . As the weeks rolled on and the spring drew nearer , Elisabeth gradually took up the thread of human interest again . Fortunately for her she was very busy with plans for the benefit of the work - people at the Osierfield . She started a dispensary ; she opened an institute ; she inaugurated courses of lectures and entertainments for keeping the young men out of the public - houses in the evenings ; she gave to the Wesleyan Conference a House of Rest — a sweet little house , looking over the fields toward the sunset — where tired ministers might come and live at ease for a time to regain health and strength ; and in Sedgehill Church she put up a beautiful east window to the memory of Maria Farringdon , and for a sign - post to all such pilgrims as were in need of one , as the east window in St. Peter 's had once been a sign - post to herself showing her the way to Zion . In all these undertakings Christopher was her right hand ; and while Elisabeth planned and paid for them , he carefully carried them out — the hardest part of the business , and the least effective one . When Elisabeth had set afoot all these improvements for the benefit of her work - people , she turned her attention to the improving of herself ; and she informed Christopher that she had decided to go up to London , and fulfil the desire of her heart by studying art at the Slade School . "
76723	76727	76354	76354	me	0	" Christopher objected ; "
76772	76773	76774	76774	I	0	" "
76826	76836	76821	76821	I	0	" Christopher did not like the idea at all . "
76855	76856	76859	76859	they	1988	" "
76928	76934	76914	76914	she	227	" Christopher still looked doubtful . "
76956	76957	76954	76954	Elisabeth	102	" "
76980	76981	76970	76970	I	0	" "
77061	77096	77099	77099	you	0	" Elisabeth grew rather pale ; that there would ever come a day when Christopher would not be there to fall back upon was a contingency which until now had never occurred to her . "
77118	77119	77099	77099	you	0	" "
77127	77128	77099	77099	you	0	" "
77137	77164	77099	77099	you	0	" It seemed to Elisabeth as if the earth beneath her feet had suddenly decided to reverse its customary revolution , and to transpose its poles . "
77179	77180	77181	77181	I	0	" "
77203	77204	77206	77206	he	1997	" "

77219	77223	77225	77225	I	0	" suggested Elisabeth . "
77241	77263	77232	77232	I	0	" Elisabeth 's lip trembled ; she felt that a hemisphere uninhabited by Christopher would be a very dreary hemisphere indeed . "
77275	77279	77273	77273	yourself	125	" she coaxed ; "
77298	77324	77280	77280	I	0	" Christopher hardened his heart . He had seen the quiver of Elisabeth 's lip , and it had almost proved too strong for him . "
77341	77349	77329	77329	I	0	" Elisabeth 's eyes filled with tears . "
77384	77385	77386	77386	I	0	" "
77483	77484	77478	77478	she	102	" "
77499	77516	77517	77517	I	0	" And Elisabeth stretched out two pleading hands toward him . Christopher turned away from her . "
77527	77533	77517	77517	I	0	" and his voice shook ; "
77555	77556	77593	77593	I	0	" "
77562	77563	77593	77593	I	0	" "
77568	77569	77570	77570	I	0	" "
77581	77582	77583	77583	I	0	" "
77612	77718	77738	77738	you	2004	" The tears dried on Elisabeth 's lashes . The old feeling of being at war with Christopher , which had laid dormant for so long , now woke up again in her heart , and inclined her to defy rather than to plead . If he cared for duty more than for her , he did not care for her much , she said to herself ; and she was far too proud a woman ever to care for a man — even in the way of friendship — who obviously did not care for her . Still , she condescended to further argument . "
77729	77733	77748	77748	you	2004	" she said , "
77783	77784	77787	77787	you	2004	" "
77834	77835	77828	77828	I	0	" "
77872	77918	77867	77867	they	2009	" Christopher winced ; the nightmare of his life had been the terror of boring Elisabeth , for he was wise enough to know that a woman may love a man with whom she is angry , but never one by whom she is bored . "
77925	77933	77923	77923	you	2004	" Elisabeth continued , tossing her head , "
77971	77972	77973	77973	I	0	" "
77981	78109	77975	77975	you	2013	" replied Christopher quietly . He was puzzled to find Elisabeth so bitter against him on a mere question of money , as she was usually a most unworldly young person ; again he did not understand that she was not really fighting over the matter at issue , but over the fact that he had put something before his friendship for her . Once she had quarrelled with him because he seemed to think more of his business than of her ; now she was quarrelling with him because he thought more of his duty than of her ; for the truth that he could not have loved her so much had he not loved honour more , had not as yet been revealed to Elisabeth . "
78120	78125	77975	77975	you	2013	" she went on , "
78160	78184	77975	77975	you	2013	" and she waved her hand in a sweep , supposed to include the Willows and the Osierfield and all that appertained thereto , "
78273	78427	78433	78433	you	2018	" Christopher was cut to the quick ; Elisabeth had hit the nail on the head . After all , it was not his own interests that he felt bound to sacrifice to the claims of honour , but hers ; and it was this consideration that made him feel the sacrifice almost beyond his power . He knew that it was his duty to do everything he could to fulfil the conditions of Miss Farringdon 's will ; he also knew that he was compelled to do this at Elisabeth 's expense and not at his own ; and the twofold knowledge well - nigh broke his heart . His misery was augmented by his perception of how completely Elisabeth misunderstood him , and of how little of the truth all those years of silent devotion had conveyed to her mind ; and his face was white with pain as he answered — "
78515	78516	78506	78506	me	0	" "
78519	78524	78506	78506	me	0	" rudely exclaimed Elisabeth . "
78532	78541	78506	78506	me	0	" he went on , ignoring her interruption , "
78596	78597	78585	78585	Peter	203	" "
78719	78785	78705	78705	I	0	" Elisabeth was fighting desperately hard ; the full power of her strong will was bent upon making Christopher do what she wished and stay with her in England ; not only because she needed him , but because she felt that this was a Hastings or Waterloo between them , and that if she lost this battle , her ancient supremacy was gone forever . "
78855	78856	78849	78849	I	0	" "
78884	78885	78886	78886	I	0	" "
78896	78897	78886	78886	I	0	" "
78908	78909	78899	78899	you	2018	" "
78927	79234	78924	78924	you	2018	" For one wild moment Christopher felt that he must tell Elisabeth how passionately he would woo her , should she lose her fortune ; and how he would spend his life and his income in trying to make her happy , should George Farringdon 's son be found and she cease to be one of the greatest heiresses in the Midlands . But he held himself back by the bitter knowledge of how cruelly appearances were against him . He had made up his mind to do the right thing at all costs ; at least , he had not exactly made up his mind — he saw the straight path , and the possibility of taking any other never occurred to him . But if he succeeded in this hateful and ( to a man of his type ) inevitable quest , he would not only sacrifice Elisabeth 's interests , he would also further his own by making it possible for him to ask her to marry him — a thing which he felt he could never do as long as she was one of the wealthiest women in Mershire , and he was only the manager of her works . Duty is never so difficult to certain men as when it wears the garb and carries with it the rewards of self - interest ; others , on the contrary , find that a joint - stock company , composed of the Right and the Profitable , supplies its passengers with a most satisfactory permanent way whereby to travel through life . There is no doubt that these latter have by far the more comfortable journey ; but whether they are equally contented when they have reached that journey 's end , none of them have as yet returned to tell us . "
79253	79257	79251	79251	you	2029	" Elisabeth persisted . "
79268	79269	79251	79251	you	2029	" "
79306	79307	79309	79309	you	2029	" "
79323	79324	79325	79325	I	0	" "
79331	79354	79325	79325	I	0	" Elisabeth rose from her seat and drew herself up to her full height , as became a dethroned and offended queen . "
79401	79604	79605	79605	He	2035	" she said , as she swept out of the room . It was her final shot , and it told . She could hardly have selected one more admirably calculated to wound , and it went straight through Christopher 's heart . It was now obvious that she did not love him , and never could have loved him , he assured himself , or she would not have misjudged him so cruelly , or said such hard things to him . He did not realize that an angry woman says not what she thinks , but what she thinks will most hurt the man with whom she is angry . He also did not realize — what man does?—how difficult it is for any woman to believe that a man can care for her and disagree with her at the same time , even though the disagreement be upon a purely impersonal question . Naturally , when the question happens to be personal , the strain on feminine faith is still greater — in the majority of cases too great to be borne . Thus Christopher and Elisabeth came to the parting of the ways . She said to herself , "
79627	79634	79605	79605	He	2035	" And he said to himself , "
79668	81390	79666	79666	her	2036	" Thus they moved along parallel lines ; and parallel lines never meet — except in infinity . Christopher went to Australia in search of George Farringdon 's son , and Elisabeth stayed in England and cherished bitter thoughts in her heart concerning him . That imagination of hers — which was always prone to lead her astray — bore most terribly false witness against Christopher just then . It portrayed him as a hard , self - righteous man , ready to sacrifice the rest of mankind to the Moloch of what he considered to be his own particular duty and spiritual welfare , and utterly indifferent as to how severe was the suffering entailed on the victims of this sacrifice . And , as Christopher was not at hand to refute the charges of Elisabeth 's libellous fancy by his own tender and unselfish personality , the accuser took advantage of his absence to blacken him more and more . It was all in a piece with the rest of his character , she said to herself ; he had always been cold and hard and self - contained . When his house had been left unto him desolate by the stroke which changed his uncle from a wise and kindly companion into a helpless and peevish child , she had longed to help and comfort him with her sympathy ; and he had thrown it back in her face . He was too proud and too superior to care for human affection , she supposed ; and now he felt no hesitation in first forsaking her , and then reducing her to poverty , if only by so doing he could set himself still more firmly on the pedestal of his own virtue . So did Elisabeth 's imagination traduce Christopher ; and Elisabeth listened and believed . At first she was haunted by memories of how good he had been to her when her cousin Maria died , and many a time before ; and she used to dream about him at night with so much of the old trust and affection that it took all the day to stamp out the fragrance of tenderness which her dreams had left behind . But after a time these dreams and memories grew fewer and less distinct , and she persuaded herself that Christopher had never been the true and devoted friend she had once imagined him to be , but that the kind and affectionate Chris of olden days had been merely a creature of her own invention . There was no one to plead his cause for him , as he was far away , and appearances were on the side of his accuser ; so he was tried in the court of Elisabeth 's merciless young judgment , and sentenced to life - long banishment from the circle of her interests and affections . She forgot how he had comforted her in the day of her adversity . If he had allowed her to comfort him , she would have remembered it forever ; but he had not ; and in this world men must be prepared to take the consequences of their own mistakes , even though those mistakes be made through excess of devotion to another person . In certain cases it may be necessary to pluck out the right eye and cut off the right hand ; but there is no foundation for supposing that the operation will be any the less painful because of the righteous motive inducing it . And so Christopher Thornley learned by bitter experience , when , after many days , he returned from a fruitless search for the missing heir , to find the countenance of Elisabeth utterly changed toward him . She was quite civil to him — quite polite ; she never attempted to argue or quarrel with him as she had done in the old days , and she listened patiently to all the details of his doings in Australia ; but with gracious coldness she quietly put him outside the orbit of her life , and showed him plainly that he was now nothing more to her than her trustee and the general manager of her works . It was hard on Christopher — cruelly hard ; yet he had no alternative but to accept the position which Elisabeth , in the blindness of her heart , assigned to him . Sometimes he felt the burden of his lot was almost more than he could bear ; not because of its heaviness , as he was a brave man and a patient one , but because of the utter absence of any joy in his life . Men and women can endure much sorrow if they have much joy as well ; it is when sorrow comes and there is no love to lighten it , that the Hand of God lies heavy upon them ; and It lay heavy upon Christopher 's soul just then . Sometimes , when he felt weary unto death of the dreary routine of work and the still drearier routine of his uncle 's sick - room , he recalled with a bitter smile how Elisabeth used to say that the gloom and smoke of the furnaces was really a pillar of cloud to show how God was watching over the people at the Osierfield as He watched over them in the wilderness . Because she had forgotten to be gracious to him , he concluded that God had forgotten to be gracious to him also — a not uncommon error of human wisdom ; but though his heart was wounded and his days darkened by her injustice toward him , he never blamed her , even in his inmost thoughts . He was absolutely loyal to Elisabeth . One grim consolation he had — and that was the conviction that he had not won , and never could have won , Elisabeth 's love ; and that , therefore , poverty or riches were matters of no moment to him . Had he felt that temporal circumstances were the only bar between him and happiness , his position as her paid manager would have been unendurable ; but now she had taught him that it was he himself , and not any difference in their respective social positions , which really stood between herself and him ; and , that being so , nothing else had any power to hurt him . Wealth , unshared by Elisabeth , would have been no better than want , he said to himself ; success , uncrowned by her , would have been equivalent to failure . When Christopher was in Australia he succeeded in tracing George Farringdon as far as Broken Hill , and there he found poor George 's grave . He learned that George had left a widow and one son , who had left the place immediately after George 's death ; but no one could give him any further information as to what had subsequently become of these two . And he was obliged at last to abandon the search and return to England , without discovering what had happened to the widow and child . Some years after his nephew 's fruitless journey to Australia Richard Smallwood died ; and though the old man had been nothing but a burden during the last few years of his life , Christopher missed him sorely when he was gone . It was something even to have a childish old man to love him , and smile at his coming ; now there was nobody belonging to him , and he was utterly alone . But the years which had proved so dark to Christopher had been full of brightness and interest to Elisabeth . She had fulfilled her intention of studying at the Slade School , and she had succeeded in her work beyond her wildest expectations . She was already recognised as an artist of no mean order . Now and then she came down to the Willows , bringing Grace Cobham with her ; and the young women filled the house with company . Now and then they two went abroad together , and satisfied their souls with the beauty of the art of other lands . But principally they lived in London , for the passion to be near the centre of things had come upon Elisabeth ; and when once that comes upon any one , London is the place in which to live . People wondered that Elisabeth did not marry , and blamed her behind her back for not making suitable hay while it was as yet summer with her . But the artist - woman never marries for the sake of being married — or rather for the sake of not being unmarried — as so many of her more ordinary sisters do ; her art supplies her with that necessary interest in life , without which most women become either invalids or shrews , and — unless she happens to meet the right man — she can manage very well without him . George Farringdon 's son had never turned up , in spite of all the efforts to discover him ; and by this time Elisabeth had settled down into the belief that the Willows and the Osierfield were permanently hers . She had long ago forgiven Christopher for setting her and her interests aside , and going off in search of the lost heir — at least she believed that she had ; but there was always an undercurrent of bitterness in her thoughts of him , which proved that the wound he had then dealt her had left a scar . Several men had wanted to marry Elisabeth , but they had not succeeded in winning her . She enjoyed flirting with them , and she rejoiced in their admiration , but when they offered her their love she was frightened and ran away . Consequently the world called her cold ; and as the years rolled on and no one touched her heart , she began to believe that the world was right . "
81399	81408	79666	79666	her	2036	" Grace Cobham said to her one day , "
81500	81501	81502	81502	I	0	" "
81518	81523	81524	81524	I	0	" replied Elisabeth meekly ; "

81550	81551	81560	81560	You	0	" "

81690	81695	81697	81697	I	0	" said Elisabeth sadly ; "
81715	81722	81723	81723	I	0	" Grace gazed at her thoughtfully . "
81751	81752	81753	81753	I	0	" "
81771	81772	81765	81765	you	0	" "

81924	81925	81934	81934	Elisabeth	102	" "
81936	81943	81934	81934	Elisabeth	102	" Elisabeth pondered for a moment . "
81962	81963	81958	81958	I	0	" "
81975	81976	81970	81970	you	0	" "
81998	82010	81983	81984	no one	3126	" said Elisabeth , the smile dying out of her eyes ; "
82044	82045	82036	82036	nobody	409	" "
82059	82063	82046	82046	You	0	" suggested Grace . "
82081	82421	82066	82066	I	0	" As Elisabeth sat alone in her own room that night , she thought about what Grace had said , and wondered if she were really too cold ever to experience that common yet wonderful miracle which turns earth into heaven for most people once in their lives . She had received much love and still more admiration in her time ; but she had never been allowed to give what she had to give , and she was essentially of the type of woman to whom it is more blessed to give than to receive . She had never craved to be loved , as some women crave ; she had only asked to be allowed to love as much as she was capable of loving , and the permission had been denied her . As she looked back over her past life , she saw that it had always been the same . She had given the adoration of her childhood to Anne Farringdon , and Anne had not wanted it ; she had given the devotion of her girlhood to Felicia , and Felicia had not wanted it ; she had given the truest friendship of her womanhood to Christopher , and Christopher had not wanted it . As for the men who had loved her , she had known perfectly well that she was not essential to them ; had she been , she would have married them ; but they could be happy without her — and they were . For Grace she had the warmest sense of comradeship ; but Grace 's life was so full on its own account , that Elisabeth could only be one of many interests to her . Elisabeth was so strong and so tender , that she could have given much to any one to whom she was absolutely necessary ; but she felt she could give of her best to no man who desired it only as a luxury — it was too good for that . "
82430	82441	82066	82066	I	0	" she said to herself , with a whimsical smile . "
82568	82819	82564	82564	I	0	" And with this reflection Elisabeth endeavoured to console herself for the non - appearance of that fairy prince , who , in her childish dreams , had always been wounded in the tournament of life , and had turned to her for comfort . The years which had passed so drearily for Christopher , had cast their shadows also over the lives of Alan and Felicia Tremaine . When Willie was a baby , his nurse accidentally let him fall ; and the injury he then received was so great that , as he grew older , he was never able to walk properly , but had to punt himself about with a little crutch . This was a terrible blow to Alan ; and became all the greater as time went on , and Felicia had no other children to share his devotion . Felicia , too , felt it sorely ; but she fretted more over the sorrow it was to her husband than on her own account . There was a great friendship between Willie and Elisabeth . Weakness of any kind always appealed to her , and he , poor child ! was weak indeed . So when Elisabeth was at the Willows and Willie at the Moat House , the two spent much time together . He never wearied of hearing about the things that she had pretended when she was a little girl ; and she never wearied of telling him about them . "
82854	82877	82878	82878	I	0	" said Willie one day , as he and Elisabeth were sitting on the old rustic seat in the Willows ' garden . "
82895	82913	82914	82914	They	2064	" And he pointed with his thin little finger to the blue hills beyond the green valley . "
82921	82925	82914	82914	They	2064	" replied Elisabeth . "
82958	82959	82952	82952	they	2064	" "

83148	83152	83092	83092	their	2064	" Willie asked . "
83166	83170	83092	83092	their	2064	" Willie sighed . "
83179	83183	83092	83092	their	2064	" he said . "

83239	83245	83224	83224	they	2064	" Willie made further inquiry . "
83272	83273	83265	83265	them	2083	" "
83284	83293	83265	83265	them	2083	" said Willie , nestling up to Elisabeth ; "
83303	83316	83298	83299	a princess	2087	" She put her strong arm round him and held him close . "
83322	83326	83298	83299	a princess	2087	" she began , "
83341	83342	83329	83339	a princess , who lived among the smoke and the furnaces	2088	" "

83574	83578	83518	83519	a third	2097	" Willie observed . "

83900	83907	83908	83908	She	744	" Elisabeth 's eyes grew dreamy . "
84064	84065	84054	84054	they	2129	" "
84074	84075	84037	84038	the princess	744	" "

84098	84110	84095	84095	Nobody	409	" But Willie 's youthful curiosity was far from being satisfied . "
84121	84125	84113	84115	the fairy prince	2133	" he inquired . "
84138	84615	84133	84133	I	0	" And Willie had to be content with this uncertain state of affairs . So had Elisabeth . For some time now she had been making small bonfires of the Thames ; but the following spring Elisabeth set the river on fire in good earnest by her great Academy picture , The Pillar of Cloud . It was the picture of the year ; and it supplied its creator with a copious draught of that nectar of the gods which men call fame . It was a fine picture , strongly painted , and was a representation of the Black Country , with its mingled gloom and glare , and its pillar of smoke always hanging over it . In the foreground were figures of men and women and children , looking upward to the pillar of cloud ; and , by the magic spell of the artist , Elisabeth had succeeded in depicting on their faces , for such who had eyes to see it , the peace of those who knew that God was with them in their journey through the wilderness . They were worn and weary and toil - worn , as they dwelt in the midst of the furnaces ; but , through it all , they looked up to the overshadowing cloud and were lightened , and their faces were not ashamed . In the far distance there was a glimpse of the sun setting behind a range of hills ; and one felt , as one gazed at the picture and strove to understand its meaning , that the pillar of cloud was gradually leading the people nearer and nearer to the far - off hills and the land beyond the sunset ; and that there they would find an abundant compensation for the suffering and poverty that had blighted their lives as they toiled here for their daily bread . Even those who could not understand the underlying meaning of Elisabeth 's picture , marvelled at the power and technical skill whereby she had brought the weird mystery of the Black Country into the heart of London , until one almost felt the breath of the furnaces as one gazed entranced at her canvas ; and those who did understand the underlying meaning , marvelled still more that so young a woman should have learned so much of life 's hidden mysteries — forgetting that art is no intellectual endowment , but a revelation from God Himself , and that the true artist does not learn but knows , because God has whispered to him . There was another picture that made a sensation in that year 's Academy ; it was the work of an unknown artist , Cecil Farquhar by name , and was noted in the catalogue as The Daughters of Philip . It represented the "
84624	84831	84133	84133	I	0	" of Philip of Cæsarea ; but it did not set them forth in the dress and attitude of inspired sibyls . Instead of this it showed them as they were in their own home , when the Spirit of the Lord was not upon them , but when they were ordinary girls , with ordinary girls ' interests and joys and sorrows . One of them was braiding her magnificent black hair in front of a mirror ; and another was eagerly perusing a letter with the love - light in her eyes ; a third was weeping bitterly over a dead dove ; and a fourth — the youngest — was playing merrily with a monkey . It was a dazzling picture , brilliant with rich Eastern draperies and warm lights ; and shallow spectators wondered what the artist meant by painting the prophetesses in such frivolous and worldly guise ; but the initiated understood how he had fathomed the tragedy underlying the lives of most women who are set apart from their fellows by the gift of genius . When the Spirit is upon them they prophesy , by means of pictures or poems or stories or songs ; and the world says , "
84879	85353	85354	85354	I	0	" The world forgets that the gift of genius is a thing apart from the woman herself , and that these women at heart are very women , as entirely as their less gifted sisters are , and have the ordinary woman 's longing for love and laughter , and for all the little things that make life happy . A pinnacle is a poor substitute for a hearthstone , from the feminine point of view ; and laurel wreaths do not make half so satisfactory a journey 's end as lovers ' meetings . All of which it is difficult for a man to understand , since fame is more to him than it is to a woman , and love less ; therefore the knowledge of this truth proved Cecil Farquhar to be a true artist ; while the able manner in which he had set it forth showed him to be also a highly gifted one . And the world is always ready to acknowledge real merit when it sees it , and to do homage to the same . The Daughters of Philip carried a special message to the heart of Elisabeth Farringdon . She had been placed on her pinnacle , and had already begun to find how cold was the atmosphere up there , and how much more human she was than people expected and allowed for her to be . She felt like a statue set up in the market - place , that hears the children piping and mourning , and longs to dance and weep with them ; but they did not ask her to do either — did not want her to do either — and if she had come down from her pedestal and begged to be allowed to play with them or comfort them , they would only have been frightened and run away . But here at last was a man who understood what she was feeling ; to whom she could tell her troubles , and who would know what she meant ; and she made up her mind that before that season was over , she and the unknown artist , who had painted The Daughters of Philip , should be friends . It was the night of the Academy soirée in the year of Elisabeth 's triumph ; she was being petted and fêted on all sides , and passed through the crowded rooms in a sort of royal progress , surrounded by an atmosphere of praise and adulation . Of course she liked it — what woman would not?—but she was conscious of a dull ache of sadness , at the back of all her joy , that there was no one to share her triumph with her ; no one to whom she could say , "
85377	85389	85390	85390	I	0	" no one who would be made happy by her whisper , "
85404	85424	85390	85390	I	0	" It was as yet early in the evening when the President turned for a moment from his duties as "
85427	85433	85434	85435	Miss Farringdon	102	" to say to her , "
85473	85724	85463	85463	he	233	" And then the usual incantation was gone through , which constitutes an introduction in England — namely , the repetition of two names , whereof each person hears only his or her own ( an item of information by no means new or in any way to be desired ) , while the name of the other contracting party remains shrouded in impenetrable mystery ; and Elisabeth found herself face to face with the man whom she specially desired to meet . Cecil Farquhar was a remarkably handsome man , nearer forty than thirty years of age . He was tall and graceful , with golden hair and the profile of a Greek statue ; and , in addition to these palpable charms , he possessed the more subtle ones of a musical voice and a fascinating manner . He treated every woman , with whom he was brought into contact , as if she were a compound of a child and a queen ; and he had a way of looking at her and speaking to her as if she were the one woman in the world for whom he had been waiting all his life . That women were taken in by this half - caressing , half - worshipping manner was not altogether their fault ; perhaps it was not altogether his . Very attractive people fall into the habit of attracting , and are frequently unconscious of , and therefore irresponsible for , their success . "
85739	85758	85730	85730	you	2142	" he said to Elisabeth , as they walked through the crowded rooms in search of a seat ; "
85805	85816	85819	85819	you	0	" Elisabeth looked at him slyly through her long eyelashes . "
85840	85858	85830	85830	your	0	" Farquhar laughed , and Elisabeth thought he had the most beautiful teeth she had ever seen . "
85885	85886	85890	85890	you	0	" "
85896	85936	85890	85890	you	0	" asked Elisabeth , with the dictatorial air of a woman who is accustomed to be made much of and deferred to , as he found a seat for her in the vestibule , under a palm - tree . "

86032	86043	86044	86044	I	0	" replied Elisabeth , and her eyes shone like stars ; "

90641	90647	90637	90639	an attractive woman	2331	" he said to himself , "
90685	90935	90936	90936	I	0	" Farquhar cultivated the distinguished Miss Farringdon assiduously , and the friendship between them grew apace . Each had a certain attraction for the other ; and , in addition , they enjoyed that wonderful freemasonry which exists among all followers of the same craft , and welds these together in a bond almost as strong as the bond of relationship . The artist in Farquhar was of far finer fibre than the man , as is sometimes the case with complex natures ; so that one side of him gave expression to thoughts which the other side of him was incapable of comprehending . He did not consciously pretend that he was better than he was , and he really believed the truths which he preached ; but when the gods serve their nectar in earthen vessels , the vessels are apt to get more credit than they deserve , and the gods less . To Elisabeth , Cecil was extremely interesting ; and she understood — better than most women would have done — the difference between himself and his art , and how the one must not be measured by the other . The artist attracted her greatly ; she had so much sympathy with his ways of looking at life and of interpreting truth ; as for the man , she had as yet come to no definite conclusion in her mind concerning him ; it was not easy for mankind to fascinate Elisabeth Farringdon . "
90946	90972	90944	90944	confessor	2334	" he said to her one Sunday afternoon , when he dropped in to find her alone , Grace Cobham having gone out to tea . "

91320	91324	91317	91317	you	2337	" said Farquhar . "

91561	91565	91566	91566	I	0	" Farquhar sighed . "

91631	91636	91624	91624	I	0	" Elisabeth replied slowly . "

92073	92077	92078	92078	they	2353	" agreed Cecil ; "

92276	92280	92294	92295	St. Paul	252	" Cecil remarked , "

92464	92465	92457	92462	the veriest Pharisee that ever breathed	2381	" "

92492	92496	92457	92462	the veriest Pharisee that ever breathed	2381	" added Elisabeth ; "
92585	92607	92570	92570	you	2385	" There was a pause while the footman brought in tea and Elisabeth poured it out ; then Farquhar said suddenly — "
92668	92669	92665	92665	your	2389	" "
92679	92683	92670	92670	I	0	" laughed Elisabeth ; "

92820	92821	92822	92822	I	0	" "
92852	92860	92861	92861	I	0	" And Elisabeth 's eyes grew sad . "
92874	92894	92861	92861	I	0	" replied Cecil ; and he really meant it , for the artist in him was uppermost just then . "
92901	92902	92896	92896	you	102	" "
92915	92924	92907	92907	you	102	" After a moment 's silence Elisabeth asked — "
92940	92941	92926	92926	you	102	" "
92957	92980	92947	92947	I	0	" replied Cecil , who would have accepted the invitation of a countess if it had been to meet his bitterest foe . "
92995	93108	92989	92989	I	0	" Elisabeth said . And then other callers were shown in , and the conversation was brought to an abrupt conclusion ; but it left behind it a pleasant taste in the minds of both the principals . It was a lovely summer 's day when Lady Silverhampton collected her forces at Paddingdon , conveyed them by rail as far as Reading , and then transported them from the train to her steam - launch on the river . The party consisted of Lady Silverhampton herself , Lord and Lady Robert Thistletown , Lord Stonebridge , Sir Wilfred Madderley ( President of the Royal Academy ) , Cecil Farquhar , and Elisabeth . "
93118	93133	93109	93109	I	0	" said the hostess , as they packed themselves into the dainty little launch ; "
93227	93228	93208	93208	I	0	" "
93234	93239	93208	93208	I	0	" exclaimed Lord Robert ; "

93269	93275	93241	93241	I	0	" Sir Wilfred Madderley remarked . "
93294	93299	93300	93300	I	0	" Lord Robert sighed . "
93443	93444	93436	93436	I	0	" "
93452	93457	93447	93447	you	0	" exclaimed his wife . "
93513	93514	93515	93515	We	2412	" "
93526	93531	93515	93515	We	2412	" said the hostess ; "

93554	93559	93560	93560	I	0	" Lord Robert retorted . "
93653	93654	93647	93648	some people	1461	" "
93662	93667	93647	93648	some people	1461	" added Lord Stonebridge . "
93675	93682	93647	93648	some people	1461	" And Lord Bobby sighed again . "
93695	93700	93701	93701	She	102	" continued Lady Silverhampton . "
93714	93734	93735	93735	She	102	" Every one looked admiringly at the subject of this remark . Elisabeth Farringdon was the fashion just then . "
93747	93752	93744	93744	she	102	" said the President . "
93765	93766	93760	93760	you	0	" "
93784	93789	93768	93768	you	0	" Lord Bobby exclaimed , "

93861	93865	93859	93859	you	0	" said Elisabeth . "
93894	93902	93866	93866	I	0	" Lord Bobby shook his finger warningly . "

93977	93982	93961	93963	an intelligent man	2429	" Lord Robert wondered . "
94007	94008	94003	94003	he	2429	" "

94265	94272	94251	94251	he	2429	" Lord Stonebridge amended this remark . "
94279	94280	94275	94275	you	0	" "
94375	94382	94369	94369	you	0	" Lord Bobby clapped his hands . "
94396	94400	94369	94369	you	0	" he ejaculated . "
94407	94417	94369	94369	you	0	" murmured Sir Wilfred Madderley , under his breath . "
94458	94459	94446	94446	you	0	" "
94476	94481	94502	94502	he	2440	" Lord Bobby objected , "

94684	94703	94675	94675	you	2452	" And her ladyship looked round for the applause which she had learned to expect as her right . "
94710	94722	94704	94704	You	2452	" cried Lord Stonebridge , while the others murmured their approval . "
94766	94767	94733	94733	callers	2455	" "
94790	94794	94795	94795	I	0	" said Elisabeth ; "

94836	94841	94812	94812	I	0	" Sir Wilfred remarked ; "

94875	94881	94870	94870	one	543	" added Lord Bobby thoughtfully , "

94910	94915	94916	94916	I	0	" said Lady Silverhampton ; "
94944	94951	94936	94936	I	0	" Lord Stonebridge began to argue . "
94968	94969	94936	94936	I	0	" "

95149	95153	95115	95115	she	259	" Elisabeth remarked , "

95193	95203	95190	95191	a genius	2299	" murmured Cecil Farquhar . Lady Silverhampton contradicted him . "
95216	95217	95211	95211	she	259	" "
95232	95236	95220	95220	I	0	" said Elisabeth ; "

95249	95253	95245	95245	You	2464	" said Cecil . "

95274	95275	95255	95255	I	0	" "
95283	95288	95289	95289	they	2476	" cried Lady Silverhampton ; "
95299	95300	95297	95297	Elisabeth	102	" "
95378	95379	95381	95385	the lovers of the future	2482	" "
95390	95395	95396	95396	I	0	" exclaimed Lord Bobby . "
95483	95489	95492	95492	Bobby	257	" Lady Robert blushed becomingly . "
95507	95508	95492	95492	Bobby	257	" "
95582	95583	95567	95568	Miss Farringdon	102	" "
95597	95601	95605	95605	they	2487	" said Elisabeth , "
95696	95697	95693	95693	she	2492	" "
95710	95715	95693	95693	she	2492	" Lord Bobby interposed , "
95812	95813	95799	95799	they	2498	" "
95830	95836	95851	95851	you	2502	" said Lady Robert thoughtfully ; "
95859	95860	95855	95855	they	3428	" "
95871	95875	95864	95864	they	3428	" Elisabeth assented ; "
95905	95906	95889	95889	I	0	" "
95927	95934	95889	95889	I	0	" suggested Farquhar . Elisabeth demurred . "
96009	96018	96019	96019	I	0	" Sir Wilfred Madderley laughed softly to himself . "
96026	96027	96023	96023	you	2502	" "
96038	96043	96023	96023	you	2502	" Lord Bobby argued ; "
96163	96164	96144	96144	he	2515	" "
96179	96183	96173	96174	the great	2517	" said Elisabeth , "
96192	96193	96195	96195	me	0	" "
96252	96253	96242	96242	I	0	" "
96261	96266	96257	96258	Lady K.	264	" asked the hostess . "
96346	96347	96349	96351	A perfect woman	2525	" "
96356	96360	96349	96351	A perfect woman	2525	" murmured Elisabeth . "
96363	96389	96349	96351	A perfect woman	2525	" continued Bobby , or however the thing goes . I do n't always quote quite accurately , you will perceive ! I generally improve . "
96390	96404	96406	96406	Elisabeth	102	" I 'm not sure that Lady Kesterton does believe in the pedigree , "
96410	96426	96427	96428	Lord Bobby	257	" because she once went out of her way to assure me that she did . "
96431	96456	96457	96457	Elisabeth	102	" I beseech you to be careful , Miss Farringdon ; you 'll never get that photograph if you keep forgetting yourself like this ! "
96460	96608	96457	96457	Elisabeth	102	" If I were a man I should belong to the Herald 's Office . It would be such fun to be called a ' Red Bonnet ' or a ' Green Griffin , ' or some other nice fairy - tale - ish name ; and to make it one 's business to unite divided families , and to restore to deserving persons their long - lost great - great - grandparents . Think of the unselfish joy one would feel in saying to a worthy grocer , ' Here is your great - great - grandmother ; take her and be happy ! ' Or to a successful milliner , ' I have found your mislaid grandfather ; be a mother to him for the rest of your life ! ' It would give one the most delicious , fairy - godmotherly sort of satisfaction ! "
96609	96613	96614	96615	Sir Wilfred	255	" It would , "
96618	96632	96614	96615	Sir Wilfred	255	" One would feel one 's self a philanthropist of the finest water . "
96633	96647	96649	96650	Lady Silverhampton	245	" Thinking about almonds - and - raisins has made me feel hungry , "
96652	96686	96649	96650	Lady Silverhampton	245	" Let us have lunch ! And while the servants are laying the table , we had better get out of the boat and have a stroll . It would be more amusing . "
96718	96727	96728	96728	she	102	" You are very quiet to - day , "
96731	96755	96728	96728	she	102	" how is that ? You are generally such a chatty person , but to - day you out - silence the Sphinx . "
96756	96762	96649	96650	Lady Silverhampton	245	" You know the reason . "
96763	96791	96728	96728	she	102	" No ; I do n't . To my mind there is no reason on earth strong enough to account for voluntary silence . So tell me . "
96792	96908	96728	96728	she	102	" I am silent because I want to talk to you ; and if I ca n't do that , I do n't want to talk at all . But among all these grand people you seem so far away from me . Yesterday we were such close friends ; but to - day I stretch out groping hands , and try in vain to touch you . Do you never dream that you seek for people for a long time and find them at last ; and then , when you find them , you can not get near to them ? Well , I feel just like that to - day with you . "
96924	96933	96934	96934	she	102	" Yes , I know that dream well , "
96938	96958	96934	96934	she	102	" I have often had it ; but I never knew that anybody had ever had it except me . "
97311	97324	97325	97325	she	102	" I think you are the most sympathetic person I ever met , "
97328	97342	97325	97325	she	102	" You have what the Psalmist would call ' an understanding heart . ' "
97343	97369	97325	97325	she	102	" I think it is only you whom I understand , Miss Farringdon ; and that only because you and I are so much alike . "
97370	97391	97325	97325	she	102	" I should have thought you would have understood everybody , you have such quick perceptions and such keen sympathies . "
97443	97516	97517	97517	Elisabeth	102	" No ; I do n't understand everybody . I do n't understand all these fine people whom we are with to - day , for instance . They seem to me so utterly worldly and frivolous and irresponsible , that I have n't patience with them . I daresay they look down upon me for not having blood , and I know I look down upon them for not having brains . "
97570	97576	97579	97579	she	102	" But they have brains , "
97587	97595	97596	97596	he	233	" They talk a lot of nonsense , "
97600	97643	97596	97596	he	233	" Exactly . People without brains never talk nonsense ; that is just where the difference comes in . If a man talks clever nonsense to me , I know that man is n't a fool ; it is a sure test . "
97644	97651	97665	97665	she	102	" There is nonsense and nonsense . "
97652	97660	97661	97661	Elisabeth	102	" And there are fools and fools . "
97689	97695	97697	97697	Cecil	233	" I despise mere frivolity , "
97700	97760	97697	97697	Cecil	233	" My dear Mr. Farquhar , there is a time for everything ; and if you think that a lunch - party on the river in the middle of the season is a suitable occasion for discussing Lord Stonebridge 's pecuniary difficulties , or solving Lady Silverhampton 's religious doubts , I can only say that I do n't . "
97788	97802	97803	97803	Cecil	233	" Still , you can not deny that the upper classes are frivolous , "
97806	97915	97803	97803	Cecil	233	" But I do deny it . I do n't think that they are a bit more frivolous than any other class , but I think they are a good deal more plucky . Each class has its own particular virtue , and the distinguishing one of the aristocracy seems to me to be pluck ; therefore they make light of things which other classes of society would take seriously . It is n't that they do n't feel their own sorrows and sicknesses , but they wo n't allow other people to feel them ; which is , after all , only a form of good manners . "
97923	97937	97917	97917	Cecil	233	" I belong to the middle class and I am proud of it . "
97938	97986	97803	97803	Cecil	233	" So do I ; but identifying one 's self with one class does n't consist in abusing all the others , any more than identifying one 's self with one church consists in abusing all the others — though some people seem to think it does . "
97987	98023	98025	98025	Cecil	233	" These grand people may entertain you and be pleasant to you in their way , I do n't deny ; but they do n't regard you as one of themselves unless you are one , "
98047	98193	98036	98036	Elisabeth	102	" And why should they ? Sir Wilfred and you and I are pleasant enough to them in our own way , but we do n't regard any of them as one of ourselves unless he is one . They do n't show it , and we do n't show it : we are all too well - mannered ; but we can not help knowing that they are not artists any more than they can help knowing that we are not aristocrats . Being conscious that certain people lack certain qualities which one happens to possess , is not the same thing as despising those people ; and I always think it as absurd as it is customary to describe one 's consciousness of one 's own qualifications as self - respect , and other people 's consciousness of theirs as pride and vanity . "
98194	98207	98209	98209	Cecil	233	" Then are n't you ever afraid of being looked down upon ? "
98231	98345	98224	98224	Elisabeth	102	" Good gracious , no ! Such an idea never entered into my head . I do n't look down upon other people for lacking my special gifts , so why should they look down upon me for lacking theirs ? Of course they would look down upon me and make fun of me if I pretended to be one of them , and I should richly deserve it ; just as we look down upon and make fun of Philistines who cover their walls with paper fans and then pretend that they are artists . Pretence is always vulgar and always ridiculous ; but I know of nothing else that is either . "
98346	98352	98354	98363	Cecil , to whose artistic sense fineness of any kind	2542	" How splendid you are ! "
98380	98409	98354	98363	Cecil , to whose artistic sense fineness of any kind	2542	" Therefore you will not despise me for being so inferior to you — you will only help me to grow more like you , wo n't you ? "
98826	98862	98823	98823	Cecil	233	" I have had such a hard life , with no one to care for me ; and the hardness of my lot has marred my character , and — through that — my art . "
98863	98870	98871	98871	Elisabeth	102	" Tell me about your life , "
98875	98892	98871	98871	Elisabeth	102	" I seem to know so little of you and yet to know you so well . "
98893	99049	98823	98823	Cecil	233	" You shall read what back - numbers I have , but most of them have been lost , so that I have not read them myself . I really do n't know who I am , as my father died when I was a baby , and my poor mother followed him in a few months , never having recovered from the shock of his death . I was born in Australia , at Broken Hill , and was an only child . As far as I can make out , my parents had no relations ; or , if they had , they had quarrelled with them all . They were very poor ; and when they died , leaving one wretched little brat behind them , some kind friends adopted the poor beggar and carried him off to a sheep - farm , where they brought him up among their own children . "
99050	99056	98823	98823	Cecil	233	" Poor little lonely boy ! "
99057	99134	98871	98871	Elisabeth	102	" I was lonely — more lonely than you can imagine ; for , kind as they were to me , I was naturally not as dear to them as their own children . I was an outsider ; I have always been an outsider ; so , perhaps , there is some excuse for that intense soreness on my part which you so much deprecate whenever this fact is once more brought home to me . "
99135	99147	99149	99149	Elisabeth	102	" I am sorry that I was so hard on you , "
99157	99181	99149	99149	Elisabeth	102	" but it is one of my worst faults that I am always being too hard on people . Will you forgive me ? "
99182	99188	98871	98871	Elisabeth	102	" Of course I will . "
99206	99212	99213	99213	she	102	" Please tell me more , "
99216	99260	99213	99213	she	102	" The other children were such a loud , noisy , happy - go - lucky pack , that they completely overpowered a delicate , sensitive boy . Moreover , I detested the life there — the roughness and unrefinement of it all . "
99277	99288	99262	99262	Cecil	233	" Did you stay with them till you grew up ? "
99289	99374	98871	98871	Elisabeth	102	" Yes ; I was educated — after a fashion — with their own sons . But at last a red - letter day dawned for me . An English artist came to stay at the sheep - farm , and discovered that I also was among the prophets . He was a bachelor , and he took an uncommon fancy to me ; it ended in his adopting me and bringing me to England , and making of me an artist like himself . "
99375	99383	99384	99384	Elisabeth	102	" Another point of similarity between us ! "
99387	99403	99384	99384	Elisabeth	102	" my parents died when I was a baby , and I also was adopted . "
99404	99429	98871	98871	Elisabeth	102	" I am so glad ; all the sting seems to be taken out of things if I feel I share them with you . "
99430	99439	98871	98871	Elisabeth	102	" Then where is your adopted father now ? "
99440	99480	99384	99384	Elisabeth	102	" He died when I was five - and - twenty , Miss Farringdon ; and left me barely enough to keep me from abject poverty , should I not be able to make a living by my brush . "
99481	99493	98871	98871	Elisabeth	102	" And you have never learned anything more about your parents ? "
99494	99593	98871	98871	Elisabeth	102	" Never ; and now I expect I never shall . The friends who brought me up told me that they believed my father came from England , and had been connected with some business over here ; but what the business was they did not know , nor why he left it . It is almost impossible to find out anything more , after this long lapse of time ; it is over thirty years now since my parents died . And , besides , I very much doubt whether Farquhar was their real name at all . "
99594	99601	99700	99701	her ladyship	4384	" What makes you think that ? "
99602	99629	99631	99631	Cecil	233	" Because the name was carefully erased from the few possessions my poor father left behind him . So now I have let the matter drop , "
99638	99662	99631	99631	Cecil	233	" as it is sometimes a mistake to look up back - numbers in the colonies ; they are not invariably pleasant reading . "
99688	99698	99700	99701	her ladyship	4384	" If any of you are tired of life , "
99708	99744	99746	99747	Lord Bobby	257	" I wish you 'd try some of this lobster mayonnaise that my new cook has made , and report on it . To me it looks the most promising prescription for death by torture . "
100803	100810	100812	100812	Elisabeth	102	" Are you going my way ? "
100907	100916	100918	100918	Christopher	121	" Yes , Miss Farringdon , I am , "
101007	101016	101018	101018	Elisabeth	102	" Then we might as well walk together . "
101127	101144	101145	101145	she	102	" You are very quiet this afternoon . Are n't you going to talk to me ? "
101191	101201	101202	101202	he	121	" Yes — yes , of course I am , "
101206	101239	101202	101202	he	121	" what shall we talk about ? I am afraid there is nothing interesting to tell you about the Osierfield , things are going on so regularly there , and so well . "
101356	101363	101365	101365	Elisabeth	102	" I 'm glad of that , "
101376	101424	101369	101369	her	102	" It was distinctly kind of you to find time to run down here , in the midst of your London life , to see Willie ! He fretted after you sadly , and I am afraid the poor little fellow is not long for this world . "
101688	101706	101707	101707	he	121	" This is the first time I have had an opportunity of congratulating you on your success , "
101714	101755	101707	101707	he	121	" we are all very proud of it at Sedgehill ; but , believe me , there is no one who rejoices in it a tithe as much as I do , if you will allow me to say so . "
101807	101813	101814	101814	she	102	" Thank you so much , "
101817	101843	101814	101814	she	102	" it is very nice of you all to be pleased with me ! I always adored being admired and praised , if you remember . "
101909	101922	101923	101923	Elisabeth	102	" I suppose you saw my picture in this year 's Academy , "
101926	101963	101923	101923	Elisabeth	102	" Saw it ? I should think I did . I went up to town on purpose to see it , as I always do when you have pictures on view at any of the shows . "
101964	101973	101974	101974	Christopher	121	" And what did you think of it ? "
101985	102003	101982	101982	he	121	" Do you want me to say pretty things to you or to tell you the truth ? "
102004	102013	102015	102015	Elisabeth	102	" Why , the truth , of course , "
102034	102049	102015	102015	Elisabeth	102	" And you wo n't be angry with me , or think me impertinent ? "
102050	102055	102057	102057	Elisabeth	102	" Of course not , "
102076	102135	102159	102159	she	102	" I thought it was a distinctly powerful picture — a distinctly remarkable picture — and if any one but you had painted it , I should have been delighted with it ; but somehow I felt that it was not quite up to your mark — that you could do , and will do , better work . "
102162	102177	102159	102159	she	102	" In what way do you think the work could have been done better ? "
102178	102268	102269	102269	Elisabeth	102	" That is just what I ca n't tell you ; I wish I could ; but I 'm not an artist , unfortunately . It seems to me that there are other people ( not many , I admit , but still some ) who could have painted that picture ; while you are capable of doing work which no one else in the world could possibly do . Naturally I want to see you do your best , and am not satisfied when you do anything less . "
102274	102285	102271	102271	her	102	" You are very hard to please , Mr. Thornley . "
102286	102331	102338	102338	She	102	" I know I am , where your work is concerned ; but that is because I have formed such a high ideal of your powers . If I admired you less , I should admire your work more , do n't you see ? "
102407	102420	102421	102421	Elisabeth	102	" I shall never do a better piece of work than that , "
102562	102587	103064	103064	she	102	" Oh , yes , you will ; you will fulfil my ideal of you yet . I cherish no doubts on that score . "
102588	102601	102603	102603	Elisabeth	102	" I ca n't think what you see wrong in my picture , "
102607	102672	102603	102603	Elisabeth	102	" I do n't see anything wrong in it . Good gracious ! I must have expressed myself badly if I conveyed such an impression to you as that , and you would indeed be justified in writing me down an ass . I think it is a wonderfully clever picture — so clever that nobody but you could ever paint a cleverer one . "
102673	102693	103064	103064	she	102	" Well , I certainly could n't . You must have formed an exaggerated estimate of my artistic powers . "
102694	102713	103064	103064	she	102	" I think not ! You can , and will , paint a distinctly better picture some day . "
102714	102720	102603	102603	Elisabeth	102	" In what way better ? "
102721	102883	103064	103064	she	102	" Ah ! there you have me . But I will try to tell you what I mean , though I speak as a fool ; and if I say anything very egregious , you must let my ignorance be my excuse , and pardon the clumsy expression of my intentions because they are so well meant . It does n't seem to me to be enough for anybody to do good work ; they must go further , and do the best possible work in their power . Nothing but one 's best is really worth the doing ; the cult of the second - best is always a degrading form of worship . Even though one man 's second - best be intrinsically superior to the best work of his fellows , he has nevertheless no right to offer it to the world . He is guilty of an injustice both to himself and the world in so doing . "
102884	102926	103064	103064	she	102	" I do n't agree with you . This is an age of results ; and the world 's business is with the actual value of the thing done , rather than with the capabilities of the man who did it . "
102927	102997	102603	102603	Elisabeth	102	" You are right in calling this an age of results , Miss Farringdon ; but that is the age 's weakness and not its strength . The moment men begin to judge by results , they judge unrighteous judgment . They confound the great man with the successful man ; the saint with the famous preacher ; the poet with the writer of popular music - hall songs . "
102998	103020	102603	102603	Elisabeth	102	" Then you think that we should all do our best , and not bother ourselves too much as to results ? "
103021	103046	103064	103064	she	102	" I go further than that ; I think that the mere consideration of results incapacitates us from doing our best work at all . "
103047	103055	103057	103057	Elisabeth	102	" I do n't agree with you , "
103067	103157	103064	103064	she	102	" I daresay I am wrong ; but you asked me for my candid opinion and I gave it to you . It is a poor compliment to flatter people — far too poor ever to be paid by me to you ; and in this case the simple truth is a far greater compliment than any flattery could be . You can imagine what a high estimate I have formed of your powers , when so great a picture as The Pillar of Cloud fails to satisfy me . "
103198	103212	103213	103213	she	102	" I suppose you have heard nothing more about George Farringdon 's son , "
103220	103230	103213	103213	she	102	" I wonder if he will ever turn up ? "
103231	103254	103256	103256	Christopher	121	" Oh ! I hardly think it is likely now ; I have quite given up all ideas of his doing so , "
103259	103265	103256	103256	Christopher	121	" But supposing he did ? "
103266	103333	103213	103213	she	102	" In that case I am afraid he would be bound to enter into his kingdom . But I really do n't think you need worry any longer over that unpleasant contingency , Miss Farringdon ; it is too late in the day ; if he were going to appear upon the scene at all , he would have appeared before now , I feel certain . "
103334	103340	103256	103256	Christopher	121	" You really think so ? "
103341	103384	103256	103256	Christopher	121	" Most assuredly I do . Besides , it will not be long before the limit of time mentioned by your cousin is reached ; and then a score of George Farringdon 's sons could not turn you out of your rights . "
103710	103713	103714	103714	he	161	" Dear , "
103722	103792	103714	103714	he	161	" I 've got to begin life over again so as to go the way that Willie went . The little chap made me promise to meet him in the country over the hills , as he called it ; and I 've never broken a promise to Willie and I never will . It will be difficult for us , I know ; but God will help us . "
103803	103809	103810	103810	she	3146	" There is no God , "
103813	103821	103810	103810	she	3146	" you have often told me so . "
103822	103858	103714	103714	he	161	" I know I have ; that was because I was such a blind fool . But now I know that there is a God , and that you and I must serve Him together . "
103859	103867	103868	103868	Felicia	199	" How can we serve a myth ? "
103871	103891	103868	103868	Felicia	199	" He is no myth , Felicia . I lied to you when I told you that He was . "
103919	104010	104011	104011	Alan	161	" Do you think you can play pitch - and - toss with a woman 's soul in that way ? Well , you ca n't . When I met you I believed in God as firmly as any girl believed ; but you laughed me out of my faith , and proved to me what a string of lies and folly it all was ; and then I believed in you as firmly as before I had believed in God , and I knew that Christianity was a fable . "
104018	104029	104011	104011	Alan	161	" Good heavens ! Felicia , did I do this ? "
104030	104097	103868	103868	Felicia	199	" Of course you did , and you must take the consequences of your own handiwork ; it is too late to undo it now . Do n't try to comfort me , even if you can drug yourself , with fairy - tales about meeting Willie again . I shall never see my little child again in this life , and there is no other . "
104098	104110	104011	104011	Alan	161	" You are wrong ; believe me , you are wrong . "
104124	104162	104112	104112	Alan	161	" It is only what you taught me . But because you took my faith away from me , it does n't follow that you can give it back to me again ; it has gone forever . "
104163	104186	103868	103868	Felicia	199	" Oh , Felicia , Felicia , may God and you and Willie forgive me , for I can never forgive myself ! "
104187	104253	103868	103868	Felicia	199	" I can not forgive you , because I have nothing to forgive ; you did me no wrong in opening my eyes . And God can not forgive you , because there never was a God ; so you did Him no wrong . And Willie can not forgive you , because there is no Willie now ; so you did him no wrong . "
104254	104283	104284	104284	Felicia	199	" My dearest , it can not all have gone from you forever ; it will come back to you , and you will believe as I do . "
104289	104328	104286	104286	her	2641	" Never ; it is too late . You have taken away my Lord , and I know not where you have laid Him ; and , however long I live , I shall never find Him again . "
104410	104420	104422	104422	Cecil	233	" How shall I manage to live without you ? "
104435	104464	104422	104422	Cecil	233	" I shall fall from my ideals when I am away from your influence , and again become the grovelling worlding that I was before I met you . "
104465	104485	104422	104422	Cecil	233	" But you must n't do anything of the kind . I am not the keeper of your conscience . "
104486	104540	104422	104422	Cecil	233	" But you are , and you must be . I feel a good man and a strong one when I am with you , and as if all things were possible to me ; and now that I have once found you , I can not and will not let you go . "
104541	104601	104620	104620	his	233	" You will have to let me go , Mr. Farquhar ; for I go down to the Willows at the end of the month , and mean to stay there for some time . I have enjoyed my success immensely ; but it has tired me rather , and made me want to rest and be stupid again . "
104602	104610	104612	104612	Cecil	233	" But I can not spare you , "
104708	104714	104715	104715	Farquhar	233	" Do n't you understand , "
104719	104788	104715	104715	Farquhar	233	" all that you have been to me : how you have awakened the best that is in me , and taught me to be ashamed of the worst ? And do you think that I shall now be content to let you slip quietly out of my life , and to be the shallow , selfish , worldly wretch I was before the Academy soirée ? Not I. "
104930	105046	104926	104926	Cecil	233	" Elisabeth , wo n't you be my wife , and so make me into the true artist which , with you to help me , I feel I am capable of becoming ; but of which , without you , I shall always fall short ? You could do anything with me — you know you could ; you could make me into a great artist and a good man , but without you I can be neither . Surely you will not give me up now ! You have opened to me the door of a paradise of which I never dreamed before , and now do n't shut it in my face . "
105047	105059	105061	105061	Elisabeth	102	" I do n't want to shut it in your face , "
105064	105101	105061	105061	Elisabeth	102	" surely you know me better than that . But I feel that you are expecting more of me than I can ever fulfil , and that some day you will be sadly disappointed in me . "
105102	105159	105160	105160	Elisabeth	102	" No , no ; I never shall . It is not in you to disappoint anybody , you are so strong and good and true . Tell me the truth : do n't you feel that I am as clay in your hands , and that you can do anything with me that you choose ? "
105173	105249	105168	105168	her	102	" I feel that I could do anything with you if only I loved you enough ; but I also feel that I do n't love you , and that therefore I can do nothing with you at all . I believe with you that a strong woman can be the making of a man she loves ; but she must love him first , or else all her strength will be of no avail . "
105255	105300	105250	105250	Farquhar	233	" I thought you did love me . You always seemed so glad when I came and sorry when I left ; and you enjoyed talking to me , and we understood each other , and were happy together . Can you deny that ? "
105301	105386	105160	105160	Elisabeth	102	" No ; it is all true . I never enjoyed talking with anybody more than with you ; and I certainly never in my life met any one who understood my ways of looking at things as thoroughly as you do , nor any one who entered so completely into all my moods . As a friend you are most satisfactory to me , as a comrade most delightful ; but I can not help thinking that love is something more than that . "
105387	105393	105395	105395	Cecil	233	" But it is n't , "
105398	105453	105395	105395	Cecil	233	" that is just where lots of women make such a mistake . They wait and wait for love all their lives ; and find out too late that they passed him by years ago , without recognising him , but called him by some wrong name , such as friendship and the like . "
105454	105462	105160	105160	Elisabeth	102	" I wonder if you are right . "
105463	105524	105160	105160	Elisabeth	102	" I am sure that I am . Women who are at all romantic , have such exaggerated ideas as to what love really is . Like the leper of old , they ask for some great thing to work the wonderful miracle upon their lives ; and so they miss the simple way which would lead them to happiness . "
105531	105537	105538	105538	she	102	" I enjoy your society , "
105541	105570	105538	105538	she	102	" and I adore your genius , and I pity your loneliness , and I long to help your weakness . Is this love , do you think ? "
105571	105582	105160	105160	Elisabeth	102	" Yes , yes ; I am certain of it . "
105583	105591	105593	105593	Elisabeth	102	" I thought it would be different , "
105596	105684	105593	105593	Elisabeth	102	" I thought that when it did come it would transform the whole world , just as religion does , and that all things would become new . I thought it would turn out to be the thing that we are longing for when the beauty of nature makes us feel sad with a longing we know not for what . I thought it would change life 's dusty paths into golden pavements , and earth 's commonest bramble - bush into a magic briar - rose . "
105685	105691	105160	105160	Elisabeth	102	" And it has n't ? "
105692	105746	105747	105747	Cecil	233	" No ; everything is just the same as it was before I met you . As far as I can see , there is no livelier emerald twinkling in the grass of the Park than there ever is at the end of July , and no purer sapphire melting into the Serpentine . "
105751	105799	105747	105747	Cecil	233	" You are as absurdly romantic as a school - girl ! Surely people of our age ought to know better than still to believe in fairyland ; but , as I have told you before , you are dreadfully young for your age in some things . "
105800	105822	105160	105160	Elisabeth	102	" I suppose I am . I still do believe in fairyland — at least I did until ten minutes ago . "
105823	105833	105160	105160	Elisabeth	102	" I assure you there is no such place . "
105834	105839	105747	105747	Cecil	233	" Not for anybody ? "
105840	105849	105160	105160	Elisabeth	102	" Not for anybody over twenty - one . "
105850	105856	105858	105858	Elisabeth	102	" I wish there was , "
105863	105882	105858	105858	Elisabeth	102	" I should have liked to believe it was there , even if I had never found it . "
105883	106085	105160	105160	Elisabeth	102	" Do n't be silly , lady mine . You are so great and wise and clever that I can not bear to hear you say foolish things . And I want us to talk about how you are going to help me to be a great painter , and how we will sit together as gods , and create new worlds . There is nothing that I can not do with you to help me , Elisabeth . You must be good to me and hard upon me at the same time . You must never let me be content with anything short of my best , or willing to do second - rate work for the sake of money ; you must keep the sacredness of art ever before my eyes , but you must also be very gentle to me when I am weary , and very tender to me when I am sad ; you must encourage me when my spirit fails me , and comfort me when the world is harsh . All these things you can do , and you are the only woman who can . Promise me , Elisabeth , that you will . "
106086	106187	106189	106189	Cecil	233	" I can not promise anything now . You must let me think it over for a time . I am so puzzled by it all . I thought that when the right man came and told a woman that he loved her , she would know at once that it was for him — and for him only — that she had been waiting all her life ; and that she would never have another doubt upon the subject , but would feel convinced that it was settled for all time and eternity . And this is so different ! "
106195	106218	106191	106191	his	233	" I suppose girls sometimes feel like that when they are very young ; but not women of your age , Elisabeth . "
106219	106239	106191	106191	his	233	" Well , you must let me think about it . I can not make up my mind yet . "
106963	106983	106984	106984	she	102	" The things that come too late are almost as bad as the things that never come at all , "
106999	107002	107004	107004	God	105	" too late "
107183	107216	107217	107217	Elisabeth	102	" If one is doomed to live always on this side of the hills , it is a waste of time to think too much about the life on the other side , "
107222	107318	107217	107217	Elisabeth	102	" and I have wasted a lot of time in this way ; but I can not help wondering why we are allowed to think such lovely thoughts , and to believe in such beautiful things , if our dreams are never to come true , but are only to spoil us for the realities of life . Now I must bury all my dear , silly , childish idols , as Jacob did ; and I will not have any stone to mark the place , because I want to forget where it is . "
107535	107543	107551	107551	her	102	" What is the matter , dear ? "
107562	107576	107551	107551	her	102	" You are in trouble , and you must let me help you . "
107584	107599	107600	107600	she	267	" Oh ! give him back to me — give him back to me , "
107603	107622	107600	107600	she	267	" you can never love him as I do , you are too cold and proud and brilliant . "
107629	107635	107623	107623	Elisabeth	102	" Whatever do you mean ? "
107636	107641	107642	107642	Quenelda	267	" You have everything , "
107657	107837	107642	107642	Quenelda	267	" you had money and position to begin with , and everybody thought well of you and admired you and made life easy for you . And then you came out of your world into ours , and carried away the prizes which we had been striving after for years , and beat us on our own ground ; but we were n't jealous of you — you know that we were n't ; we were glad of your success , and proud of you , and we admired your genius as much as the outside world did , and never minded a bit that it was greater than ours . But even then you were not content — you must have everything , and leave us nothing , just to satisfy your pride . You are like the rich man who had everything , and yet took from the poor man his one ewe lamb ; and I am sure that God — if there is a God — will punish you as He punished that rich man . "
107860	107868	107869	107869	she	102	" I still do n't understand you , "
107872	107886	107887	107888	the girl	629	" I never had anything nice in my life till I met him , "
107890	108128	107887	107888	the girl	629	incoherently—"I had always been poor and pinched and wretched and second - rate ; even my pictures were never first - rate , though I worked and worked all I knew to make them so . And then I met Cecil Farquhar , and I loved him , and everything became different , and I did n't mind being second - rate if only he would care for me . And he did ; and I thought that I should always be as happy as I was then , and that nothing would ever be able to hurt me any more . Oh ! I was so happy — so happy — and I was such a fool , I thought it would last forever ! I worked hard and saved every penny that I could , and so did he ; and we should have been married next year if you had n't come and spoiled it all , and taken him away from me . And what is it to you now that you have got him ? You are too proud and cold to love him , or anybody else , and he does n't care for you a millionth part as much as he cares for me ; yet just because you have money and fame he has left me for you . And I love him so — I love him so ! "
108147	108163	108165	108165	Elisabeth	102	" Come and sit down beside me and tell me quietly what is the matter , "
108168	108218	108165	108165	Elisabeth	102	" I can do nothing and understand nothing while you go on like this . But you are wrong in supposing that I took your lover from you purposely ; I did not even know that he was a friend of yours . He ought to have told me . "
108219	108361	108371	108371	Elisabeth	102	" No , no ; he could n't tell you . Do n't you see that the temptation was too strong for him ? He cares so much for rank and money , and things like that , my poor Cecil ! And all his life he has had to do without them . So when he met you , and realized that if he married you he would have all the things he wanted most in the world , he could n't resist it . The fault was yours for tempting him , and letting him see that he could have you for the asking ; you knew him well enough to see how weak he was , and what a hold worldly things had over him ; and you ought to have allowed for this in dealing with him . "
108620	108635	108636	108636	Elisabeth	102	" I still think he ought to have told me there was another woman , "
108639	108783	108636	108636	Elisabeth	102	" Not he . He knew well enough that your pride could not have endured the thought of another woman , and that that would have spoiled his chance with you forever . There always is another woman , you know ; and you women , who are too proud to endure the thought of her , have to be deceived and blinded . And you have only yourselves to thank for it ; if you were a little more human and a little more tender , there would be no necessity for deceiving you . Why , I should have loved him just the same if there had been a hundred other women , so he always told me the truth ; but he lied to you , and it was your fault and not his that he was obliged to lie . "
108818	108831	108832	108832	Quenelda	267	" If you do not believe me , here is his letter , "
108836	108992	108832	108832	Quenelda	267	" I brought it on purpose for you to read , just to show you how little you are to him . If you had loved him as I love him , I would have let you keep him , because you could have given him so many of the things that he thinks most about . But you do n't . You are one of the cold , hard women , who only care for people as long as they are good and do what you think they ought to do ; Cecil never could do what anybody thought he ought to do for long , and then you would have despised him and grown tired of him . But I go on loving him just the same , whatever he does ; and that 's the sort of love that a man wants — at any rate , such a man as Cecil . "
109039	109042	108832	108832	Quenelda	267	" Dearest Quenelda "
109071	109283	108832	108832	Quenelda	267	" I have something to say to you which it cuts me to the heart to say , but which has to be said at all costs . We must break off our engagement at once ; for the terrible truth has at last dawned upon me that we can never afford to marry each other , and that therefore it is only prolonging our agony to go on with it . You know me so well , dear little girl , that you will quite understand how the thought of life - long poverty has proved too much for me . I am not made of such coarse fibre as most men — those men who can face squalor and privation , and lack all the little accessories that make life endurable , without being any the worse for it . I am too refined , too highly strung , too sensitive , to enter upon such a weary struggle with circumstances as my marriage with a woman as poor as myself would entail ; therefore , my darling Quenelda , much as I love you I feel it is my duty to renounce you ; and as you grow older and wiser you will see that I am right . "
109495	109535	109536	109536	Your	2709	" Good - bye , my sweetest . I can not write any more ; my heart is breaking . How cruel it is that poverty should have power to separate forever such true lovers as you and I ! "
109538	109541	109542	109542	Elisabeth	102	" Cecil . "
109550	109568	109569	109569	she	102	" Do you mean to tell me that you do n't despise the man who sent this ? "
109572	109587	109569	109569	she	102	" No ; because I love him , you see . You never did . "
109588	109610	109642	109643	the girl	629	" You are right there . I never loved him . I tried to love him , but I could n't . "
109611	109638	109639	109639	Elisabeth	102	" I know you did n't . As I told you before , if you had loved him I would have given him up to you . "
109754	109767	109768	109768	she	102	" I think if one loved another person as much as that , "
109773	109786	109768	109768	she	102	" one would understand a little of how God feels about us . "
109791	109813	109788	109788	she	102	" Dear , what do you want me to do ? I will do anything in the world that you wish . "
109823	109850	109814	109814	Quenelda	269	" How good you are ! And I do n't deserve it a bit , for I 've been horrid to you and said vile things . "
109861	109872	109873	109873	she	102	" I did you a great wrong , poor child ! "
109876	109888	109873	109873	she	102	" and I want to make every reparation in my power . "
109889	109903	109814	109814	Quenelda	269	" But you did n't know you were doing me a great wrong . "
109904	109948	109873	109873	she	102	" No ; but I knew that I was acting below my own ideals , and nobody can do that without doing harm . Show me how I can give you help now ? Shall I tell Cecil Farquhar that I know all ? "
109949	109977	109873	109873	she	102	" Oh ! no ; please not . He would never forgive me for having spoiled his life , and taken away his chance of being rich . "
109997	110043	109987	109987	her	102	" Do n't cry , dear ; I will make it all right . I will just tell him that I ca n't marry him because I do n't love him ; and he need never know that I have heard about you at all . "
110647	110665	110666	110666	she	102	" It will serve him right for leaving me and going off after George Farringdon 's son , "
110671	110837	110666	110666	she	102	" to discover how little worth the finding George Farringdon 's son really was ! Christopher is so self - centred , that a thing is never properly brought home to him until it affects himself ; no other person can ever convince him that he is in the wrong . But this will affect himself ; he will hate to serve under such a man as Cecil ; I know he will ; because Cecil is just the type of person that Christopher has always looked down upon , for Christopher is a gentleman and Cecil is not . Perhaps when he finds out how inferior an iron - master Cecil is to me , Christopher will wish that he had liked me better and been kinder to me when he had a chance . I hope he will , and that it will make him miserable ; for those hard , self - righteous people really deserve to be punished in the end . "
111427	111478	111479	111479	Elisabeth	102	" My dear lady , you are going to say yes to me ; I know that you are ; you would not have sent for me if you were not , for you are far too tender - hearted to enjoy seeing pain which you are forced to give . "
111491	111497	111498	111498	she	102	" Will you sit down ? "
111501	111514	111498	111498	she	102	" there is much that I want to talk over with you . "
111575	111613	111559	111559	he	233	" Surely you are not going to refuse to marry me and so spoil my life . Elisabeth , you can not be as cruel as this , after all that we have been to each other . "
111614	111653	111654	111654	Cecil	233	" I am going to refuse to marry you , but I am not going to spoil your life . Believe me , I am not . There are other things in the world besides love and marriage . "
111666	111725	111662	111662	his	233	" Then you have played with me most abominably . The world was right when it called you a heartless flirt , and said that you were too cold to care for anything save pleasure and admiration . I thought I knew you better , more fool I ! But the world was right and I was wrong . "
111726	111738	111740	111740	Elisabeth	102	" I do n't think that we need discuss my character , "
111791	111872	111783	111783	He	233	" It is desperately hard on me that you have treated me in this way ! You might have snubbed me at once if you had wished to do so , and not have made me a laughing - stock in the eyes of the world . I made no secret of the fact that I intended to marry you ; I talked about it to everybody ; and now everybody will laugh at me for having been your dupe . "
111950	111960	111961	111961	he	233	" I do n't know what I shall do , "
111972	112009	111961	111961	he	233	" everybody is expecting our engagement to be announced , and I can not think what excuses I shall invent . A man looks such a fool when he has made too sure of a woman ! "
112010	112023	111969	111969	his	233	" Doubtless . But that is n't the woman 's fault altogether . "
112024	112072	112073	112073	Elisabeth	102	" Yes ; it is . If the woman had n't led him on , the man would n't have made sure of her . You have been unutterably cruel to me — unpardonably cruel ; and I will never forgive you as long as I live . "
112209	112218	112219	112219	she	102	" I have a story to tell you , "
112222	112235	112219	112219	she	102	" a story that will interest you , if you will listen . "
112248	112257	112219	112219	she	102	" I have no alternative , I suppose . "
112323	112335	112336	112336	he	233	" You are right — I am sure you are right , "
112343	112422	112336	112336	he	233	" it all fits in — the date and place of my birth , my parents ' poverty and friendlessness , and the mystery concerning them . Oh ! you can not think what this means to me . To be forever beyond the reach of poverty — to be able to do whatever I like for the rest of my life — to be counted among the great of the earth ! It is wonderful — wonderful ! "
112442	112451	112452	112452	he	233	" I shall have such a glorious time , "
112454	112518	112519	112519	Elisabeth	102	on—"the most glorious time man ever had ! Of course , I shall not live in that horrid Black Country — nobody could expect me to make such a sacrifice as that ; but I shall spend my winters in Italy and my summers in Mayfair , and I shall forget that the world was ever cold and hard and cruel to me . "
114551	114563	114536	114536	She	102	" Not to be given to Miss Farringdon until after my death "
114596	114622	114593	114593	she	102	" My Darling — for so I may call you at last , since you will not read this letter until after I am dead ; "
114928	115338	114917	114917	I	0	" There is one other thing I have to tell you : I am George Farringdon 's son . I should n't have bothered you with this , only I feel it is necessary — after I am gone — for you to know the truth , lest any impostor should turn up and take your property from you . Of course , as long as I am alive I can keep the secret , and yet take care that no one else comes forward in my place ; and I have made a will leaving everything I possess to you . But when I am gone , you must hold the proofs of who was really the person who stood between you and the Farringdon property . I never found it out until my uncle died ; I believed , as everybody else believed , that the lost heir was somewhere in Australia . But on my uncle 's death I found a confession from him — which is in this safe , along with my parents ' marriage certificate and all the other proofs of my identity — saying how his sister told him on her death - bed that , when George Farringdon ran away from home , he married her , and took her out with him to Australia . They had a hard life , and lost all their children except myself ; and then my father died , leaving my poor mother almost penniless . She survived him only long enough to come back to England , and give her child into her brother 's charge . My uncle went on to say that he kept my identity a secret , and called me by an assumed name , as he was afraid that Miss Farringdon would send both him and me about our business if she knew the truth ; as in those days she was very bitter against the man who had jilted her , and would have been still bitterer had she known he had thrown her over for the daughter of her father 's manager . When Maria Farringdon died and showed , by her will , that at last she had forgiven her old lover , my uncle 's mind was completely gone ; and it was not until after his death that I discovered the papers which put me in possession of the facts of the case . "
115529	115543	115566	115566	Christopher	121	" Yours , my darling , for time and eternity , Christopher Farringdon . "
116567	116585	116611	116612	the nurse	1788	written—"They made me the keeper of the vineyards ; but mine own vineyard have I not kept . "
116616	116632	116633	116633	she	1788	" Mr. Thornley is conscious now , and is asking for you , Miss Farringdon , "
116661	116716	116717	116718	The nurse	1788	" Oh ! I am so glad . I want dreadfully to see him , I have so much to say to him . But I 'll promise not to tire or excite him . Tell me , how long may I stay with him , Nurse , and how quiet must I be ? "
116722	116769	116717	116718	The nurse	1788	" It wo n't matter how long you stay or what you say , Miss Farringdon ; I do n't think it is possible for anything to hurt or help him now ; for I am afraid , whatever happens , he can not possibly recover . "
116780	116793	116774	116774	Elisabeth	102	" I am going to see the real Christopher for the first time "
116874	116881	116882	116882	he	2878	" Kiss me , my darling , "
116908	116943	116944	116944	Elisabeth	102	" I am too tired to pretend any more that I do n't love you . And it ca n't matter now whether you know or not , it is so near the end . "
116959	116964	116965	116965	she	102	" Chris , dear , "
116968	117004	116965	116965	she	102	" I want to tell you that I love you , and that I 've always loved you , and that I always shall love you ; but I 've only just found it out . "
117068	117079	117080	117080	he	121	" How did you find it out , my dearest ? "
117085	117138	117080	117080	he	121	" Through finding out that you loved me . It seems to me that my love was always lying in the bank at your account , but until you gave a cheque for it you could n't get at it . And the cheque was my knowing that you cared for me . "
117139	117150	117273	117273	Elisabeth	102	" And how did you find that out , Betty ? "
117151	117174	117273	117273	Elisabeth	102	" I was rummaging in the safe just now for the plans of the Osierfield , and I came upon your letter . "
117175	117205	117080	117080	he	121	" I did n't mean you to read that while I was alive ; but , all the same , I think I am rather glad that you did . "
117206	117271	117273	117273	Elisabeth	102	" And I am glad , too . I wish I had n't always been so horrid to you , Chris ; but I believe I should have loved you all the time , if only you had given me the chance . Still , I was horrid — dreadfully horrid ; and now it is too late to make it up to you . "
117280	117328	117273	117273	Elisabeth	102	" Do n't cry , my darling — please do n't cry . And , besides , you have made it up to me by loving me now . I am glad you understand at last , Betty ; I did so hope you would some day . "
117329	117340	117080	117080	he	121	" And you forgive me for having been so vile ? "
117341	117379	117080	117080	he	121	" There is nothing to forgive , sweetheart ; it was my fault for not making you understand ; but I did it for the best , though I seem to have made a mess of it . "
117380	117398	117080	117080	he	121	" And you like me just the same as you did before I was unkind to you ? "
117399	117408	117080	117080	he	121	" My dear , do n't you know ? "
117409	117488	117080	117080	he	121	" You see , Chris , I was wanting you to be nice to me all the time — nothing else satisfied me instead of you . And when you seemed not to like me any longer , but to care for doing your duty more than for being with me , I got sore and angry , and decided to punish you for making a place for yourself in my heart and then refusing to fill it . "
117489	117539	117080	117080	he	121	" Well , you did what you decided , as you generally do ; there is no doubt of that . You were always very prone to administer justice and to maintain truth , Elisabeth , and you certainly never spared the rod as far as I was concerned . "
117540	117611	117080	117080	he	121	" But now I see that I was wrong ; I understand that it was because you cared so much for abstract right , that you were able to care so much for me ; a lower nature would have given me a lower love ; and if only we could go through it all again , I should want you to go to Australia after George Farringdon 's son . "
117715	117721	117722	117722	Elisabeth	102	" I can see now , "
117726	117957	117722	117722	Elisabeth	102	" how much more important it is what a man is than what a man says , though I used to think that words were everything , and that people did n't feel what they did n't talk about . You used to disappoint me because you said so little ; but , all the same , your character influenced me without my knowing it ; and whatever good there is in me , comes from my having known you and seen you live up to your own ideals . People wonder that worldly things attract me so little , and that my successes have n't turned my head ; so they would have done , probably , if I had never met you ; but having once seen in you what the ideal life is , I could n't help despising lower things , though I tried my hardest not to despise them . Nobody who had once been with you , and looked even for a minute at life through your eyes , could ever care again for anything that was mean or sordid or paltry . Darling , do n't you understand that my knowing you made me better than I tried to be — better even than I wanted to be ; and that all my life I shall be a truer woman because of you ? "
118074	118190	118063	118063	she	102	" Oh ! my darling , my darling , come back to me ; I love you so that I can not let you go . The angels can do quite well without you in heaven , but I can not do without you here . Oh ! Chris , do n't go away and leave me , just now that we 've learned to understand one another . I 'll be good all my life , and do everything that you tell me , if only you wo n't go away . My dearest , I love you so — I love you so ; and I 've nobody in the world but you . "
118748	118766	118767	118767	she	102	" So we have come to the country on the other side of the hills at last , "
118788	118810	118767	118767	she	102	" I always knew it was there , but sometimes I gave up all hope of ever finding it for myself . "
118825	118839	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" And is it as nice a country as you expected , sweetheart ? "
118840	118946	118767	118767	she	102	" As nice as I expected ? I should just think it is . I knew that in the country over the hills I should find all the beautiful things I had imagined as a child and all the lovely things I had longed for as a woman ; and that , if only I could reach it , all the fairy - tales would come true . But now that I have reached it , I find that the fairy - tales fell far short of the reality , and that it is a million times nicer than I ever imagined anything could be . "
118947	118975	119094	119094	his	121	" Darling , I am glad you are so happy . But it beats me how such a stupid fellow as I am can make you so . "
118976	119053	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" Well , you do , and that 's all that matters . Nobody can tell how they do things ; they only know that they can do them . I do n't know how I can paint pictures any more than you know how you can turn smoky ironworks into the country over the hills . But we can , and do ; which shows what clever people we are , in spite of ourselves . "
119054	119076	118767	118767	she	102	" I think the cleverness lies with you in both cases — in your wonderful powers of imagination , my dear . "
119077	119091	119094	119094	his	121	" Do you ? Then that shows how little you know about it . "
119099	119117	119094	119094	his	121	" I always was stupid , you know ; you have told me so with considerable frequency . "
119118	119133	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" Oh ! so you were ; but you were never worse than stupid . "
119134	119151	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" That 's a good thing ; for stupidity is a misfortune rather than a fault . "
119152	119163	119165	119165	Elisabeth	102	" Now I was worse than stupid — much worse , "
119168	119176	119165	119165	Elisabeth	102	" but I never was actually stupid . "
119177	119238	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" Were n't you ? Do n't be too sure of that . I do n't wish to hurt your feelings , sweetheart , or to make envious rents in your panoply of wisdom ; but , do you know , you struck me now and again as being a shade — we will not say stupid , but dense ? "
119239	119257	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" When I thought you did n't like me because you went to Australia , you mean ? "
119258	119280	119165	119165	Elisabeth	102	" That was one of the occasions when your acumen seemed to be slightly at fault . And there were others . "
119285	119297	119281	119281	Elisabeth	102	" I really did think you did n't like me then . "
119298	119321	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" Denseness , my dear Elisabeth — distinct denseness . It would be gross flattery to call it by any other name . "
119322	119332	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" But you never told me you liked me . "
119333	119363	119281	119281	Elisabeth	102	" If I had , and you had then thought I did not , you would have been suffering from deafness , not denseness . You are confusing terms . "
119364	119393	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" Well , then , I 'll give in and say I was dense . But I was worse than that : I was positively horrid as well . "
119394	119439	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" Not horrid , Betty ; you could n't be horrid if you tried . Perhaps you were a little hard on me ; but it 's all over and done with now , and you need n't bother yourself any more about it . "
119440	119467	119281	119281	Elisabeth	102	" But I ought to bother about it if I intend to make a trustworthy step - ladder out of my dead selves to upper storeys . "
119468	119540	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" A trustworthy fire - escape , you mean ; but I wo n't have it . You sha'n't have any dead selves , my dear , because I shall insist on keeping them all alive by artificial respiration , or restoration from drowning , or something of that kind . Not one of them shall die with my permission ; remember that . I 'm much too fond of them . "
119541	119563	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" You silly boy ! You 'll never train me and discipline me properly if you go on in this way . "
119564	119596	119597	119597	Elisabeth	102	" Hang it all , Betty ! Who wants to train and discipline you ? Certainly not I. I am wise enough to let well — or rather perfection — alone . "
119603	119621	119601	119601	Christopher	121	" But I 'm not perfection , Chris ; you know that as well as I do . "
119622	119643	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" Probably I should n't love you so much if you were ; so please do n't reform , dear . "
119644	119654	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" And you like me just as I am ? "
119655	119676	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" Precisely . I should break my heart if you became in any way different from what you are now . "
119677	119702	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" But you must n't break your heart ; it belongs to me , and I wo n't have you smashing up my property . "
119703	119751	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" I gave it to you , it is true ; but the copyright is still mine . The copyright of letters that I wrote to you is mine ; and I believe the law of copyright is the same with regard to hearts as to letters . "
119752	119766	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" Well , anyhow , I 've written my name all over it . "
119767	119843	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" I know you have ; and it was very untidy of you , my dearest . Once would have been enough to show that it belonged to you ; but you were n't content with that : you scribbled all over every available space , until there was no room left even for advertisements ; and now nobody else will ever be able to write another name upon it as long as I live . "
119844	119886	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" I 'm glad of that ; I would n't have anybody else 's name upon it for anything . And I 'm glad that you like me just as I am , and do n't want me to be different . "
119887	119891	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" Heaven forbid ! "
119892	119937	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" But still I was horrid to you once , Chris , however you may try to gloss it over . My dear , my dear , I do n't know how I ever could have been unkind to you ; but I was . "
119938	119980	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" Never mind , sweetheart ; it is ancient history now , and who bothers about ancient history ? Did you ever meet anybody who fretted over the overthrow of Carthage , or made a trouble of the siege of Troy ? "
119981	119984	119985	119985	Elisabeth	102	" No , "
119989	120013	119985	119985	Elisabeth	102	" and I 'm really nice to you now , whatever I may have been before . Do n't you think I am ? "
120014	120042	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" I should just think you are , Betty ; a thousand times nicer than I deserve , and I am becoming most horribly conceited in consequence . "
120043	120110	118811	118811	Christopher	121	" And , after all , I agree with the prophet Ezekiel that if people are nice at the end , it does n't much matter how disagreeable they have been in the meantime . He does n't put it quite in that way , but the sentiment is the same . I suit you down to the ground now , do n't I , Chris ? "
120111	120127	119985	119985	Elisabeth	102	" You do , my darling ; and up to the sky , and beyond . "
120148	120188	120145	120145	Elisabeth	102	" When one is as divinely happy as this , is n't it difficult to realize that the earth will ever be earthy again , and the butter turnipy , and things like that ? Yet they will be . "
120189	120210	120145	120145	Elisabeth	102	" But never quite as earthy or quite as turnipy as they were before ; that 's just the difference . "
120228	120263	120224	120224	Elisabeth	102	" You never really appreciated my pictures , Chris . You never did me justice as an artist , though you did me far more than justice as a woman . Why was that ? "
120264	120305	120145	120145	Elisabeth	102	" Did n't I ? I 'm sorry . Nevertheless , I 'm not sure that you are right . I was always intensely interested in your pictures because they were yours , quite apart from their own undoubted merits . "
120306	120338	120145	120145	Elisabeth	102	" That was just it ; you admired my pictures because they were painted by me , while you really ought to have admired me because I had painted the pictures . "
120349	120388	120345	120345	Christopher	121	" Then I fell short of your requirements , dear heart ; for , as far as you and your works were concerned , I certainly never committed the sin of worshipping the creature rather than the creator . "
120389	120403	120145	120145	Elisabeth	102	" But there was a time when I wanted you to do so . "
120404	120411	120413	120413	Christopher	121	" As a matter of fact , "
120416	120540	120413	120413	Christopher	121	" I do n't believe a man who loves a woman can ever appreciate her genius properly , because love is greater than genius , and so the greater swallows up the less . In the eyes of the world , her genius is the one thing which places a woman of genius above her fellows , and the world worships it accordingly . But in the eyes of the man who loves her , she is already placed so far above her fellows that her genius makes no difference to her altitude . Thirty feet makes all the difference in the height of a weather - cock , but none at all in the distance between the earth and a fixed star . "
120541	120559	120560	120560	Christopher	121	" What a nice thing to say ! I adore you when you say things like that . "
120563	120703	120560	120560	Christopher	121	" You see , the man is interested in the woman 's works of art simply because they are hers ; just as he is interested in the rustle of her silk petticoat simply because it is hers . Possibly he is more interested in the latter , because men can paint pictures sometimes , and they can never rustle silk petticoats properly . You are right in thinking that the world adores you for the sake of your creations , while I adore your creations for the sake of you ; but you must also remember that the world would cease to worship you if your genius began to decline , while I should love you just the same if you took to painting sign - posts and illustrating Christmas cards — even if you became an impressionist . "
120704	120767	120769	120769	Elisabeth	102	" What a dear boy you are ! You really are the greatest comfort to me . I did n't always feel like this , but now you satisfy me completely , and fill up every crevice of my soul . There is n't a little space anywhere in my mind or heart or spirit that is n't simply bursting with you . "
120778	120787	120769	120769	Elisabeth	102	" My darling , how I love you ! "
120808	120816	120801	120801	Christopher	121	" What is the matter , Betty ? "
120817	120830	120769	120769	Elisabeth	102	" There is n't anything the matter . How should there be ? "
120831	120873	120801	120801	Christopher	121	" Oh , yes , there is . Do you think I have studied your face for over thirty years , my dear , without knowing every shade of difference in its expression ? Have I said anything to vex you ? "
120874	120912	120769	120769	Elisabeth	102	" No , no ; how could I be vexed with you , Chris , when you are so good to me ? I am horrid enough , goodness knows , but not horrid enough for that . "
120913	120932	120933	120933	Elisabeth	102	" Then what is it ? Tell me , dear , and see if I ca n't help ? "
120936	121065	120933	120933	Elisabeth	102	" I was thinking that there is really no going back , however much we may pretend that there is . What we have done we have done , and what we have left undone we have left undone ; and there is no blotting out the story of past years . We may write new stories , perhaps , and try to write better ones , but the old ones are written beyond altering , and must stand for ever . You have been divinely good to me , Chris , and you never remind me even by a look how I hurt you and misjudged you in the old days . But the fact remains that I did both ; and nothing can ever alter that . "
121066	121091	121164	121164	her	2901	" Silly little child , it 's all over and past now ! I 've forgotten it , and you must forget it too . "
121092	121160	121161	121161	Christopher	121	" I ca n't forget it ; that 's just the thing . I spoiled your life for the best ten years of it ; and now , though I would give everything that I possess to restore those years to you , I ca n't restore them , or make them up to you for the loss of them . That 's what hurts so dreadfully . "
121335	121347	121348	121348	Christopher	121	" I always belonged to you , you see , dear , "
121353	121380	121348	121348	Christopher	121	" and you had the right to do what you liked with your own . I had given you the right of my own free will . "
121381	121416	121296	121297	Elisabeth Farringdon	102	" But you could n't give me the right to do what was wrong . Nobody can do that . I did what was wrong , and now I must be punished for it . "
121417	121443	121348	121348	Christopher	121	" Not if I can help it , sweetheart . You shall never be punished for anything if I can bear the punishment for you . "
121444	121605	121348	121348	Christopher	121	" You ca n't help it , Chris ; that 's just the point . And I am being punished in the way that hurts most . All my life I thought of myself , and my own success , and how I was going to do this and that and the other , and be happy and clever and good . But suddenly everything has changed . I no longer care about being happy myself ; I only want you to be happy ; and yet I know that for ten long years I deliberately prevented you from being happy . Do n't you see , dear , how terrible the punishment is ? The thing I care for most in the whole world is your happiness ; and the fact remains , and will always remain , that that was the thing which I destroyed with my own hands , because I was cruel and selfish and cold . "
121606	121628	121296	121297	Elisabeth Farringdon	102	" Still , I am happy enough now , Betty — happy enough to make up for all that went before . "
121629	121641	121643	121643	Elisabeth	102	" But I can never give you back those ten years , "
121650	121751	121649	121649	her	102	voice—"never as long as I live . Oh ! Chris , I see now how horrid I was ; though all the time I thought I was being so good , that I looked down upon the women who I considered had lower ideals than I had . I built myself an altar of stone , and offered up your life upon it , and then commended myself when the incense rose up to heaven ; and I never found out that the sacrifice was all yours , and that there was nothing of mine upon the altar at all . "
121752	121788	121789	121789	Elisabeth	102	" Never mind , darling ; there is n't going to be a yours and mine any more , you know . All things are ours , and we are beginning a new life together . "
121804	121808	121809	121809	she	102	" My dearest , "
121812	121827	121809	121809	she	102	" how can I ever love you enough for being so good to me ? "
122437	122447	122449	122449	Christopher	121	" He is a cad — a low cad ! "
122460	122479	122449	122449	Christopher	121	" and I should like to tell him what I think of him , and then kick him . "
122490	122497	122498	122498	she	102	" He wanted to marry me , "
122510	122517	122519	122519	Christopher	121	" Confounded impudence on his part ! "
122521	122538	122498	122498	she	102	" But he left off when he found out that I had n't got any money . "
122539	122546	122483	122483	she	102	" Worse impudence , confound him ! "
122547	122569	122571	122571	Elisabeth	102	" Oh ! I wish you could have seen him when I told him that the money was not really mine , "
122581	122642	122571	122571	Elisabeth	102	" he cooled down so very quickly , and so rapidly turned his thoughts in another direction . Do n't you know what it is to bite a gooseberry at the front door while it pops out at the back ? Well , Cecil Farquhar 's love - making was just like that . It really was a fine sight ! "
122643	122647	122483	122483	she	102	" The brute ! "
122648	122662	122483	122483	she	102	" Never mind about him , dear ! I 'm tired of him . "
122663	122683	122684	122684	Christopher	121	" But I do mind when people dare to be impertinent to you . I ca n't help minding , "
122687	122804	122684	122684	Christopher	121	" Then go on minding , if you want to , darling — only do n't let us waste our time in talking about him . There 's such a lot to talk about that is really important — why you said so - and - so , and how you felt when I said so - and - so , ten years ago ; and how you feel about me to - day , and whether you like me as much this afternoon as you did this morning ; and what colour my eyes are , and what colour you think my new frock should be ; and heaps of really serious things like that . "
122805	122816	122483	122483	she	102	" All right , Betty ; where shall we begin ? "
122817	122838	122483	122483	she	102	" We shall begin by making a plan . Do you know what you are going to do this afternoon ? "
122839	122851	122684	122684	Christopher	121	" Yes ; whatever you tell me . I always do . "
122852	122920	122483	122483	she	102	" Well , then , you are coming with me to have tea at Mrs. Bateson 's , just as we used to do when we were little ; and I have told her to invite Mrs. Hankey as well , to make it seem just the same as it used to be . By the way , is Mrs. Hankey as melancholy as ever , Chris ? "
122921	122938	122684	122684	Christopher	121	" Quite . Time doth not breathe on her fadeless gloom , I can assure you . "
122939	122952	122953	122953	Elisabeth	102	" Wo n't it be fun to pretend we are children again ? "
122956	122975	122977	122977	Christopher	121	" Great fun ; and I do n't think it will need much pretending , do you know ? "
123164	123171	123162	123162	Elisabeth	102	" a fourth - dimension person , "
123625	123648	123650	123651	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Deary me , but it 's like old times to see Master Christopher and Miss Elisabeth having tea with us again , "
123660	123700	123650	123651	Mrs. Bateson	123	" and it seems but yesterday , Mrs. Hankey , that they were here talking over Mrs. Perkins 's wedding — your niece Susan as was — with Master Christopher in knickers , and Miss Elisabeth 's hair down . "
123708	123729	123701	123702	Mrs. Hankey	134	" So it does , Mrs. Bateson — so it does ; and yet Susan has just buried her ninth . "
123730	123737	123739	123739	Elisabeth	102	" And is she quite well ? "
123742	123757	123739	123739	Elisabeth	102	" I remember all about her wedding , and how immensely interested I was . "
123758	123768	123770	123771	Mrs. Hankey	134	" As well as you can expect , miss , "
123773	123850	123770	123771	Mrs. Hankey	134	" with eight children on earth and one in heaven , and a husband as plays the trombone of an evening . But that 's the worst of marriage ; you know what a man is when you marry him , but you have n't a notion what he 'll be that time next year . He may take to drinking or music for all you know ; and then where 's your peace of mind ? "
123851	123858	123860	123860	Elisabeth	102	" You are not very encouraging , "
123862	123874	123860	123860	Elisabeth	102	" considering that I am going to be married at once . "
123875	123920	123770	123771	Mrs. Hankey	134	" Well , miss , where 's the use of flattering with vain words , and crying peace where there is no peace , I should like to know ? I can only say as I hope you 'll be happy . Some are . "
123926	123954	123922	123922	Christopher	135	" You must n't discourage Miss Farringdon in that way , or else she 'll be throwing me over ; and then whatever will become of me ? "
124004	124072	123978	123978	she	134	" Not she , sir ; Miss Elisabeth 's got too much sense to go throwing anybody over — and especially at her age , when she 's hardly likely to get another beau in a hurry . Do n't you go troubling your mind about that , Master Christopher . You wo n't throw over such a nice gentleman as him , will you , miss ? "
124073	124086	123966	123966	she	134	" Certainly not ; though hardly on the grounds which you mention . "
124087	124225	123978	123978	she	134	" Well , miss , if you 're set on marriage you 're in luck to have got such a pleasant - spoken gentleman as Master Christopher — or I should say , Mr. Farringdon , begging his pardon . Such a fine complexion as he 's got , and never been married before , nor nothing . For my part I never thought you would get a husband — never ; and I 've often passed the remark to Mr. and Mrs. Bateson here . ' Mark my words , ' I said , ' Miss Elisabeth Farringdon will remain Elisabeth Farringdon to the end of the chapter ; she 's too clever to take the fancy of the menfolk , and too pale . They want something pink and white and silly , men do . "
124226	124235	124238	124239	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Some want one thing and some another , "
124241	124338	124238	124239	Mrs. Bateson	123	" and they know what they want , which is more than women - folks do . Why , bless you ! girls 'll come telling you that they would n't marry so - and - so , not if he was to crown 'em ; and the next thing you hear is that they are keeping company with him , and that no woman was ever so happy as them , and that the man is such a piece of perfection that the President of the Conference himself is n't fit to black his boots . "
124339	124351	124353	124353	Christopher	135	" You have hit upon a great mystery , Mrs. Bateson , "
124355	124407	124353	124353	Christopher	135	" and one which has only of late been revealed to me . I used to think , in my masculine ignorance , that if a woman appeared to dislike a man , she would naturally refuse to marry him ; but I am beginning to doubt if I was right . "
124413	124473	124408	124409	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Wait till he asks her ; that 's what I say . It 's wonderful what a difference the asking makes . Women think a sight more of a sparrow in the hand than a covey of partridges in the bush ; and I do n't blame them for it ; it 's but natural that they should . "
124474	124482	124484	124484	Christopher	135	" A poor thing but mine own , "
124486	124495	124498	124498	him	135	" That 's not the principle at all , "
124500	124516	124496	124496	Elisabeth	102	" you 've got hold of quite the wrong end of the stick this time . "
124517	124598	124408	124409	Mrs. Bateson	123	" I always do , in order to give you the right one ; as in handing you a knife I hold it by the blade . You so thoroughly enjoy getting hold of the right end of a stick , Betty , that I would n't for worlds mar your pleasure by seizing it myself ; and your delight reaches high - water - mark when , in addition , you see me fatuously clinging on to the ferrule . "
124599	124615	124617	124618	Caleb Bateson	127	" Never mind what women - folk say about women - folk , Miss Elisabeth , "
124621	124677	124617	124618	Caleb Bateson	127	" they 're no judges . But my missis has the right of it when she says that a man knows what he wants , and in general sticks to it till he gets it . And if ever a man got what he wanted in this world , that man 's our Mr. Christopher . "
124678	124686	124695	124695	his	2963	" You 're right there , Bateson , "
124706	124727	124729	124730	Mrs. Hankey	134	" And if he do n't have no objection to cleverness and a pale complexion , who shall gainsay him ? "
124732	124770	124729	124730	Mrs. Hankey	134	" If he 's content , surely it ai n't nobody 's business to interfere ; even though we may none of us , Miss Elisabeth included , be as young as we was ten years ago . "
124771	124781	124782	124782	Christopher	135	" And he is quite content , thank you , "
124787	124801	124802	124802	Elisabeth	102	" I think you were right about women not knowing their own minds , "
124808	124848	124802	124802	Elisabeth	102	" though I am bound to confess it is a little stupid of us . But I believe the root of it is in shyness , and in a sort of fear of the depth of our own feelings . "
124849	124915	124926	124927	Mrs. Hankey	134	" I daresay you 're right , miss ; and , when all 's said and done , I 'd sooner hear a woman abusing a man she really likes , than see her throwing herself at the head of a man as do n't want her . That 's the uptake of all things , to my mind ; I ca n't abide it . "
124932	125143	124926	124927	Mrs. Hankey	134	" I remember my sister Sarah , when she was a girl . There was a man wanted her ever so , and seemed as cut - up as never was when she said no . She did n't know what to do with him , he was that miserable ; and yet she could n't bring her mind to have him , because he 'd red hair and seven in family , being a widower . So she prayed the Lord to comfort him and give him consolation . And sure enough the Lord did ; for within a month from the time as Sarah refused him , he was engaged to Wilhelmina Gregg , our chapel - keeper 's daughter . And then — would you believe it?—Sarah went quite touchy and offended , and could n't enjoy her vittles , and would n't wear her best bonnet of a Sunday , and kept saying as the sons of men were lighter than vanity . Which I do n't deny as they are , but that was n't the occasion to mention it , Wilhelmina 's marriage being more the answer to prayer , as you may say , than any extra foolishness on the man 's part . "
125144	125154	125156	125156	Christopher	135	" I should greatly have admired your sister Sarah , "
125158	125186	125156	125156	Christopher	135	" she was so delightfully feminine . And as for the red - headed swain , I have no patience with him . His fickleness was intolerable . "
125187	125195	125197	125198	Mrs. Bateson	123	" Bless your heart , Master Christopher ! "
125200	125237	125197	125198	Mrs. Bateson	123	" men are mostly like that . Why should they waste their time fretting after some young woman as has n't got a civil word for them , when there are scores and scores as has ? "
125243	125267	125240	125240	his	135	" I ca n't pretend to say why ; that is quite beyond me . I only know that some of them do . "
125268	125281	125283	125283	Elisabeth	102	" But they are only the nice exceptions that prove the rule , "
125295	125307	125308	125308	he	135	" No ; it is she who is the nice exception , "
125311	125347	125308	125308	he	135	" It is only in the case of exceptionally charming young women that such a thing ever occurs ; or rather , I should say , in the case of an exceptionally charming young woman . "
125348	125359	125361	125361	Elisabeth	102	" My wedding dress will be sent home next week , "
125367	125377	125361	125361	Elisabeth	102	" would you like to come and see it ? "
125378	125385	125386	125386	they	2966	" Indeed , that we should ! "
125395	125405	125391	125392	Mrs. Bateson	123	" And what is it made of , deary ? "
125406	125410	125411	125412	Mrs. Hankey	134	" White satin . "
125421	125447	125411	125412	Mrs. Hankey	134	" White satin is a bit young , it seems to me ; and trying , too , to them as have n't much colour . "
125455	125594	125453	125453	her	134	" Still , white 's the proper thing for a bride , I do n't deny ; and I always say ' Do what 's right and proper , and never mind looks . ' The Lord does n't look on the outward appearance , as we all know ; and it ' ud be a sight better for men if they did n't , like Master Christopher there ; there 'd be fewer unhappy marriages , mark my words . Of course , lavender is n't as trying to the complexion as pure white ; no one can say as it is ; but to my mind lavender always looks as if you 've been married before ; and it 's no use for folks to look greater fools than they are , as I can see . "
125595	125599	125600	125600	Christopher	135	" Certainly not , "
125603	125632	125600	125600	Christopher	135	" If there is any pretence at all , let it be in the opposite direction , and let us all try to appear wiser than we are ! "
125633	125651	125653	125653	Hankey	134	" And that 's easy enough for some of us , such as Hankey , for instance , "
125658	125682	125653	125653	Hankey	134	" And there ai n't as much wisdom to look at as you could put on the point of a knife even then . "
125796	125816	125817	125817	she	102	" It is very good to come back to you all , and to dwell among mine own people , "
125826	125855	125817	125817	she	102	" and I am glad that Mrs. Hankey 's prophecy has come true , and that Elisabeth Farringdon will be Elisabeth Farringdon to the end of the chapter . "
