985	990	982	982	he	256	" what 's up ? "
1014	1022	1023	1023	he	77	" She 's going to be married , "
1043	1047	1048	1048	he	78	" Not Dodo ? "
1051	1054	1048	1048	he	78	" Yes . "

1141	1155	1136	1136	Jack	78	" No I think not ; at least I have n't seen her . "

1232	1239	1240	1240	he	78	" He 's my first cousin , "
1243	1265	1240	1240	he	78	" However , I may be excused for not feeling distinctly sympathetic with my first cousin . Must I congratulate him ? "
1266	1273	1275	1276	the other	268	" That 's as you like , "
1278	1326	1327	1327	he	78	" I really do n't see why you should n't . But it is rather overwhelming , is n't it ? You know Dodo is awfully charming , but she has n't got any of the domestic virtues . Besides , she ought to be an empress , "
1331	1339	1341	1341	Jack	78	" I suppose a marchioness is something , "
1343	1372	1341	1341	Jack	78	" But I did n't expect it one little bit . Of course he is hopelessly in love . And so Dodo has decided to make him happy . "
1373	1378	1380	1380	Bertie	77	" It seems so , "
1391	1401	1403	1403	Jack	78	" Ah , but do n't you see — — "
1405	1413	1415	1415	Bertie	77	" Oh , it 's all right , "
1417	1487	1415	1415	Bertie	77	" He is devoted to her , and she is clever and stimulating . Personally I should n't like a stimulating wife . I do n't like stimulating people , I do n't think they wear well . It would be like sipping brandy all day . Fancy having brandy at five o'clock tea . What a prospect , you know ! Dodo 's too smart for my taste . "
1488	1494	1496	1496	Jack	78	" She never bores one , "
1498	1533	1496	1496	Jack	78	" No , but she makes me feel as if I was sitting under a flaming gas - burner , which was beating on to what Nature designed to be my brain - cover . "
1534	1537	1539	1539	Jack	78	" Nonsense , "
1541	1554	1539	1539	Jack	78	" You do n't know her . There she is . Ah ! "
1644	1663	1632	1632	Dodo	79	" Maud , tell the boy he need n't wait . You need n't either unless you like . "
1720	1725	1726	1726	she	79	" Why , Jack , "
1733	1777	1726	1726	she	79	" here I am , you see , and I have come to be congratulated ! What are you and Bertie sitting here for like two Patiences on monuments ? Really , Jack , you would make a good Patience on a monument . "

1978	1982	1959	1959	he	78	" asked Bertie . "
1990	2004	1988	1988	you	280	" said Dodo graciously , as if she was used to saying it . "
2036	2048	1988	1988	you	280	" Bertie moved off , and Dodo sat down next Jack . "
2106	2107	2108	2108	I	0	" "
2112	2117	2108	2108	I	0	" said he candidly ; "
2125	2129	2118	2118	I	0	" Dodo frowned . "
2133	2138	2118	2118	I	0	" she said solemnly , "
2167	2182	2158	2158	you	78	" Jack was silent for a minute or two , then he said , — "

2677	2689	2708	2708	Chesterford	80	" Dodo nodded her head with an air of profound wisdom . "

3056	3061	3038	3038	Bertie	77	" said Jack angrily . "
3105	3106	3108	3108	he	80	" "
3112	3116	3108	3108	he	80	" said Dodo . "

3188	3192	3180	3180	you	314	" said Jack . "

3253	3257	3248	3248	you	78	" said Dodo ; "
3330	3331	3332	3332	You	314	" "
3342	3350	3332	3332	You	314	" said Jack in self - defence . "
3394	3398	3377	3377	I	0	" Dodo laughed . "
3408	3412	3403	3403	you	78	" she remarked , "
3495	3509	3491	3491	you	78	" she added with a fine disregard of grammar . Jack was silent . "
3516	3521	3522	3522	you	78	" said Dodo impatiently , "
3544	3551	3539	3539	you	78	" Then he interrupted her quickly . "
3717	3741	3742	3742	You	79	" He said these words in a low tone , as if he hardly wished Dodo to hear . But Dodo did hear . "
3751	3755	3742	3742	You	79	" she said . "
3821	3834	3835	3835	I	0	" Dodo struck the ground angrily with the point of her parasol . "
3847	3852	3843	3843	I	0	" she went on . "
3872	3873	3874	3874	I	0	" "
3885	3889	3874	3874	I	0	" said he . "
3944	3945	3941	3941	he	324	" "
3950	3954	3948	3948	Jack	78	" she said , "
4023	4041	4042	4042	Dodo	79	" She stood up , holding out both her hands to him . Jack was rather moved . "
4088	4134	4077	4077	I	0	" He shook her hands , and then dropped them . She stood for a moment with her eyes on the ground , looking still grave . Then she retreated a step or two , leaned against the rail , and broke into a laugh . "
4516	4532	4512	4512	I	0	" Jack went with her to her dog - cart , and helped her in . "
4540	4550	4538	4538	Beelzebub	86	" she remarked , as she took the reins , "
4565	4574	4538	4538	Beelzebub	86	" Then he went back and rejoined Bertie . "
4582	4586	4587	4587	Maud	81	" said Bertie . "
4722	4736	4689	4689	she	81	" Jack laughed hopelessly for a few minutes . Then he said , — "
4829	4839	4827	4827	Bertie	77	" Then after a minute he repeated to himself , "
4850	4851	4843	4843	she	81	" "
4854	4861	4852	4852	Jack	78	" said Bertie after another pause , "
4910	4911	4901	4901	you	78	" "
4914	4919	4901	4901	you	78	" he said simply . "
5059	5253	5049	5049	I	0	" Jack spoke dreamily , as if he was thinking of something else . It was his way not to blaze abroad anything that affected him deeply . Like Dodo he would often dissect himself in a superficial manner , and act as a kind of showman to his emotions ; but he did not care to turn himself inside out with her thoroughness . And above all , as he had just said , he hated the knowledge of a failure ; he tried to conceal it even from himself . He loved to show his brighter side to the world . When he was in society he always put on his best mental and moral clothes , those that were newest and fitted him most becomingly ; the rags and tatters were thrown deep into the darkest cupboard , and the key sternly turned on them . Now and then , however , as on this occasion , a friend brought him the key with somewhat embarrassing openness , and manners prevented him from putting his back to the door . But when it was unlocked he adopted the tone of , "
5307	5390	5391	5391	Dodo	79	" Bertie was silent . He was on those terms of intimacy with the other that do not need ordinary words of condolence or congratulation . Besides , from his own point of view , he inwardly congratulated Jack , and this was not the sort of occasion on which to tell him that congratulation rather than sympathy was what the event demanded . Then Jack went on , still with the air of a spectator than of a principal character , — "
5531	6576	5527	5527	I	0	" Jack went home meditating rather bitterly on things in general . He had a sense that Fate was not behaving very prettily to him . She had dealt him rather a severe blow in April last , which had knocked him down , and , having knocked him down , she now proceeded in a most unsportsmanlike way to kick him . Jack had a great idea of fair play , and Fate certainly was not playing fair . He would have liked to have a few words with her on the subject . The world had been very kind on the whole to him . He had always been popular , and his life , though perhaps rather aimless , was at least enjoyable . And since the world had been kind to him , he was generous to the world in general , and to his friends in particular . It had always held a high opinion of him , as a thoroughly healthy - minded and pleasant companion , and he was disposed to hold a similar opinion of it . Consequently , when Dodo had refused him that spring , he had not thought badly of her . He did not blame her , or get bitter about it ; but though he had flattered himself that he was used to Dodo 's ways , and had always recognised her capabilities in the way of surprising her friends , he had not been quite prepared for the news of her engagement . In fact , he was surprised , and also rather resentful , chiefly against the general management of mundane affairs , but partly also against Dodo herself . Dodo had not told him of her engagement ; he had been left to find it out for himself . Then , again , she was engaged to a man who was hopelessly and entirely in love with her , and for whom , apart from a quiet , unemotional liking , she did not care two straws , except in so far as he was immensely rich and had a title , two golden keys which unlocked the most secret doors of that well - furnished apartment known as Society , which constituted Dodo 's world . Hitherto her position had been precarious : she had felt that she was on trial . Her personality , her great attractiveness and talents , had secured for herself a certain footing on the very daïs of that room ; but she had always known that unless she married brilliantly she would not be sure of her position . If she married a man who would not be always certain of commanding whatever money and position — for she would never have married a wealthy brewer — could command , or , worst of all , if in her unwillingness to accept anything but the best she could get , she did not marry at all , Dodo knew that she never would have that unquestioned position that she felt was indispensable to her . Jack knew all this perfectly well — in fact Dodo had referred to it that morning — and he accepted it philosophically as being inevitable . But what he did not like was being told that he would not have done on general grounds , that he was too fond of his own way , that he would not have given Dodo rein enough . He had known Dodo too long and too well , when he proposed to her , to have any of a lover 's traditional blindness to the faults of his love . He knew that she was , above all things , strongly dramatic , that she moved with a view to effect , that she was unscrupulous in what she did , that her behaviour was sometimes in questionable taste ; but this he swallowed whole , so to speak . He was genuinely attached to her , and felt that she possessed the qualities that he would most like to have in his wife . Bertie had said to him that morning that she was stimulating , and would not wear well . Stimulating she certainly was — what lovable woman is not?—and personally he had known her long , and she did wear well . The hidden depths and unsuspected shallows were exactly what he loved her for ; no one ever fell in love with a canal ; and though the shallows were commoner than the depths , and their presence was sometimes indicated by a rather harsh jarring of the keel , yet he believed , fully and sincerely , in the dark , mysterious depths for love to lose itself in . Besides , a wife , whose actions and thoughts were as perfectly calculable and as accurately calculated as the trains in a Bradshaw , was possessed of sterling qualities which , however estimable , were more suited to a housekeeper than a mistress . These reflections were the outcome of an intimate knowledge of Dodo in the mind of a man who was in the habit of being honest with himself and the object of his love , a quality rare enough whether the lover is rejected or accepted . He had had time to think over the matter quietly to himself . He knew , and had known for many weeks , that Dodo was out of his reach , and he sat down and thought about the inaccessible fruit , not with the keen feelings of one who still hoped to get it , but with a resignation which recognised that the fruit was desirable , but that it must be regarded from a purely speculative point of view . And to do him justice , though he was very sorry for himself , he was much more sorry for Chesterford . Chesterford was his cousin , they had been brought up together at Eton and Oxford , and he knew him with that intimacy which is the result of years alone . Chesterford 's old friends had all a great respect and liking for him . As Dodo had said , "
6586	7312	6579	6581	an honest man	310	" Slight acquaintances called him slow and rather stupid , which was true on purely intellectual grounds . He was very loyal , and very much devoted to what he considered his duty , which consisted in being an excellent landlord and J.P. of his county , in voting steadily for the Conservative party in the House of Lords , in giving largely and anonymously to good objects , in going to Church on Sunday morning , where he sang hymns with fervour , and read lessons with respect , in managing a hunt in a liberal and satisfactory manner , and in avoiding any introspection or speculation about problems of life and being . He walked through the world with an upright gait , without turning his eyes or his steps to the right hand or the left , without ever concerning himself with what was not his business , but directing all his undoubtedly sterling qualities to that . He had a perfect genius for doing his duty . Nobody had ever called him shallow or foolish , but nobody on the other hand had ever , called him either deep or clever . He had probably only made one real mistake in his life , and that was when he asked Dodo to marry him ; and we have seen that Jack , who knew Dodo well , and whose opinion might be considered to be based on good grounds , thought that Dodo had committed her first grand error in accepting him . The worst of the business certainly was that he was in love with Dodo . If he had been a different sort of man , if he had proposed to Dodo with the same idea that Dodo had , when she accepted him , if he had wanted a brilliant and fascinating woman to walk through life with , who could not fail to be popular , end who would do the duties of a mistress of a great house in a regal fashion , he could not have chosen better . But what he wanted in a wife was someone to love . He loved Dodo , and apparently it had not entered his calculations that she , in accepting him , might be doing it from a different standpoint from his own in proposing to her . Dodo had smiled on him with the air of a benignant goddess who marries a mortal , when he offered her his hand and heart , and he had taken that smile as a fulfilment of his own thought . Decidedly Jack might have justification for feeling apprehensive . Jack 's only hope lay in that vein which did exist in Dodo , and which she had manifested in that outburst of tears the night before . He put it down to her dramatic instincts to a large extent , but he knew there was something besides , for Dodo did not care to play to an empty house , and the presence of her future husband alone constituted anything but a satisfactory audience . Jack had always had a considerable belief in Dodo : her attractiveness and cleverness were , of course , beyond dispute , and required proof no more than the fact that the sun rose in the morning ; but he believed in something deeper than this , which prompted such actions as these . He felt that there was some emotion that she experienced at that moment , of which her tears were the legitimate outcome , and , as he thought of this , there occurred to him the remark that Dodo had made that morning , when she expressed her regret at never having felt the sort of love that she knew Chesterford felt for her . Mrs. Vane was perhaps perfectly happy that night . Was not her daughter engaged to a marquis and a millionaire ? Was not her house going to be filled with the brightest and best of our land ? She had often felt rather resentful against Dodo , who alternately liked and despised people whom Mrs. Vane would have given her right hand to be in a position to like , and both hands to be in a position to despise . Dodo was excellent friends with "
7315	7317	6579	6581	an honest man	310	" only "
7319	7833	6579	6581	an honest man	310	" did not come and seek her at her own house , but preferred asking her to theirs . Consequently , on Mrs. Vane and Maud devolved the comparatively menial duty of leaving their cards and those of Dodo , and attending her in the capacity of the necessary adjunct . They would be asked to the same houses as Dodo , but that was all ; when they got there they had the privilege of seeing Dodo performing her brilliant evolutions , but somehow none of Dodo 's glory got reflected on to them . To be the mirror of Dodo was one of Mrs. Vane 's most cherished ideas , and she did not recollect that there are many substances whose nature forbids their acting as such to the most brilliant of illuminations . Mr. Vane was kept still more in the background . It was generally supposed that he was looking after his affairs in the country , whilst the rest of the family were amusing themselves in London . It was well known that he was the proprietor of a flourishing iron foundry somewhere in Lancashire , and apparently the iron needed special care during the months of May , June and July . In any case he was a shadow in the background , rather than a skeleton at the banquet , whom it was not necessary to ignore , because he never appeared in a position in which he could be ignored . Mrs. Vane had two principal objects in life , the first of which was to live up to Dodo , and the second to obtain , in course of time , a suitable brilliant son - in - law . The latter of these objects had been practically obtained by Dodo herself , and the first of them was in a measure realised by the large and brilliant company who assembled in her rooms that night . Mrs. Vane was a large , high - coloured woman of about middle age , whose dress seemed to indicate that she would rather not , but that , of course , may only have been the fault of the dressmaker . She had an effusive manner , which sometimes made her guests wonder what they could have done to have made her so particularly glad to see them . She constantly lamented Mr. Vane 's absence from London , and remarked , with a brilliant smile , that she felt quite deserted . Mrs. Vane 's smile always suggested a reformed vampire , who had permanently renounced her bloodthirsty habits , but had not quite got out of the way of gloating on what would have been her victims in the unregenerate days . It is only fair to say that this impression was due to the immensity of her smile , which could hardly be honestly accounted for by this uncharitable world . She was busily employed in receiving her guests when Jack came , and was , perhaps , more stupendously cordial than ever . "
7841	7855	6579	6581	an honest man	310	" she was just saying to a previous arrival when Jack came in . "
7870	7878	7868	7868	Darling	357	" she said , turning to Maud , "
7992	8133	7976	7976	she	79	" Dodo was playing the amiable white elephant to some purpose . She was standing under a large chandelier in the centre of the room , with Chesterford beside her , receiving congratulations with the utmost grace , and talking nonsense at the highest possible speed . Jack thought to himself that he had never seen anyone so thoroughly charming and brilliant , and almost wondered whether he had not been doing her an injustice all day . He saw it was impossible to get near her for the present , so he wandered off among other groups , exchanging greetings and salutations . He had made the circuit of the room , and was standing about near the door , feeling a little lonely , when Dodo came quickly towards him . She was looking rather white and impatient . "
8142	8146	8140	8140	Jack	78	" she said ; "
8192	8210	8211	8213	Dear old boy	365	" She turned round , beckoning to him , and found herself face to face with Chesterford . "
8215	8221	8211	8213	Dear old boy	365	" she said to him , "
8286	8287	8288	8288	I	0	" "
8297	8306	8288	8288	I	0	" said Jack , grasping Chesterford 's hand , "
8316	8317	8308	8308	I	0	" "
8322	8326	8320	8320	Jack	78	" said Dodo . "
8361	8362	8363	8363	I	0	" "
8369	8373	8363	8363	I	0	" said Chesterford . "
8387	8388	8384	8384	You	78	" "
8394	8398	8391	8391	I	0	" said Jack . "
8418	8419	8402	8402	we	370	" "
8426	8432	8421	8421	you	80	" said he , enthusiastically . "
8455	8691	8448	8448	Dodo	79	" The sight of Chesterford with Dodo made Jack groan in spirit . He had accepted Dodo 's rejection of him as quite final , and he never intended to open that closed book again . But this was too horrible . He felt a genuine impulse of pure compassion for Chesterford , and an irritated disgust for Dodo . Dodo was an admirable comrade , and , for some , he thought , an admirable wife . But the idea of her in comradeship with Chesterford was too absurd , and if she could never be his comrade , by what perversity of fate was it that she was going to become his wife ? Jack 's serenity was quite gone , and he wondered what had become of it . All he was conscious of was a chafing refusal to acquiesce just yet , and the anticipation of a somewhat intimate talk with Dodo . He felt half inclined to run away from the house , and not see her again , and as he followed her up to her room , he began to think that his wisdom had followed his serenity . After all , if he asked her again about her resolution to marry Chesterford , what was he doing but continuing the conversation they had in the Park that morning , in which Dodo herself had taken the initiative . "
8702	8736	8448	8448	Dodo	79	" thought Jack to himself piously , as the door of Dodo 's room closed behind him . Dodo threw herself down in a low arm - chair with an air of weariness . "
8745	8749	8743	8743	Jack	78	" she said . "
8778	8825	8775	8775	I	0	" Jack fidgeted , lit a match and blew it out again . Really it was not his fault that the conversation was going to be on this subject . He again laid the responsibility on the knees of the gods . Then he said , — "
8898	8922	8923	8923	Jack	78	" Dodo was looking at him steadily . Her breath came rather quickly , and the look of weariness had left her face . "
8925	8929	8923	8923	Jack	78	" she said , "
8977	8992	8968	8968	Jack	78	" she went on as he shrugged his shoulders , and half turned away . "
9053	9100	9047	9047	you	78	" She rose and stood by him , and laid one hand on his as it lay on the mantelpiece . He did not answer her . He was disappointed and baffled . Then she turned away from him , and suddenly threw up her arms . "
9106	9110	9047	9047	you	78	" she said , "
9183	9242	9175	9175	you	78	" There was a great anger in her voice , and she stood trembling before him . Just then the door opened , and a middle - aged lady walked in . She did not seem at all surprised . Nobody who had known Dodo long was often surprised . She walked up to Dodo and kissed her . "
9247	9251	9243	9243	I	0	" she said , "
9274	9275	9263	9263	I	0	" "
9281	9289	9277	9277	you	0	" said Dodo , returning the kiss . "
9300	9327	9295	9298	Mrs. Vivian?—Mr . Broxton	95	" Mrs. Vivian bowed , and Jack bowed , and then nobody seemed quite to know what to say next . Mrs. Vivian recovered herself first . "
9342	9348	9349	9350	Mrs. Vane	90	" she said to Dodo . "

9366	9374	9361	9361	I	0	" said Dodo , with unusual docility . "
9382	9395	9380	9380	Jack	78	" Dodo left the room , and Mrs. Vivian turned to Jack . "
9401	9405	9380	9380	Jack	78	" she said , "
9504	9509	9502	9502	herself	79	" Jack wanted to think "
9516	9528	9511	9514	an impertinent old woman	383	" but there was something in her manner that forbade it . "
9535	9540	9531	9531	you	0	" he said simply ; "
9549	9567	9546	9546	my	0	" Then he felt angry with himself for having shifted any of the blame on to Dodo . "
9571	9577	9546	9546	my	0	" said the other ambiguously . "
9590	9628	9588	9588	Dodo	79	" The diamonds were duly shown and admired , and the three went downstairs again . Mrs. Vivian took her leave shortly . She was very gracious to Jack , and as they parted she said , — "
9650	9671	9647	9647	my	0	" Jack sought Mrs. Vane to inquire who Mrs. Vivian was . Mrs. Vane was even more effusive than usual . "
9683	9685	9674	9674	she	79	" she said.—"She
9789	9799	9775	9775	I	0	" Dodo came up to Jack before he left . "
9802	9806	9775	9775	I	0	" she said , "
9893	9894	9890	9890	you	78	" "
9902	9919	9890	9890	you	78	" said Jack bluntly . Dodo lifted her eyebrows in surprise that may have been genuine . "
9923	9936	9890	9890	you	78	" she asked . Jack had no reasonable answer to give her . "
9945	9953	9939	9940	Mrs. Vivian	96	" asked Dodo suddenly . Jack paused . "
9959	9963	9939	9940	Mrs. Vivian	96	" he said ; "
9986	9987	9970	9971	Mrs. Vane	90	" "
9998	10002	9988	9988	I	0	" remarked Dodo . "
10012	10016	9988	9988	I	0	" Jack smiled . "
10028	10032	10021	10021	I	0	" he said . "
10039	10048	10035	10035	I	0	" Dodo swept him the prettiest little curtsey . "
10054	10058	10035	10035	I	0	" she said . "
10094	10095	10090	10092	a nice gentleman	393	" "
10106	11134	10098	10098	I	0	" said Jack . There is a particular beauty about the Thames valley for which you may search for years elsewhere , and not find ; a splendid lavishness in the way that the woods are cast down broadcast along the river , and a princely extravagance of thick lush hayfields , that seem determined not to leave a spare inch of land between them and the water . The whole scene has been constructed with a noble disregard of expense , in the way of water , land , and warm wood - land air . The tall , clean - limbed beech - trees have room to stretch their great , lazy arms without being prosecuted for their clumsy trespasses , and the squirrels that chatter at you from their green houses seem to have a quite unusual sleekness about them , and their insolent criticisms to each other about your walk , and general personal unattractiveness , are inspired by a larger share of animal spirits than those of other squirrels . As you row gently up in the middle of the stream , you may see a heron standing in the shallows , too lazy to fish , too supremely confident to mind the approach of anything so inferior as yourself , and from the cool shadow of the woods you may hear an old cock pheasant talking to himself , and not troubling to practise a new and original method of rocketing in June , for he knows that his time is not yet . At this time of year , too , you need not trouble to look round , to see if there are large boats full of noisy people bearing down on you ; like the pheasant , their time is not yet . But now and then the long strings of creamy bubbles appearing on the deep , quiet water , and a sound rich in associations of cool plunges into frothy streams , warns you that a lock is near . And above you may see some small village clustering down to the river 's edge , to drink of its sweet coolness , or a couple of shaggy - footed cart - horses , looking with mild wonder at this unexpected method of locomotion , lifting their dripping noses from the bright gravelly shallows to stare at you , before they proceed to finish their evening watering . Dodo was very fond of the Thames valley , and she really enjoyed giving up a day of June in London to the woods and waters . They were to start quite early in the morning , Dodo explained , and everyone was to wear their very oldest clothes , for they were going to play ducks and drakes , and drink milk in dairies , and pick buttercups , and get entirely covered with freckles . Dodo herself never freckled , and she was conscious of looking rather better for a slight touch of the sun , and it would be very dear of Mrs. Vivian if she would come too , if she did n't mind being silly all day ; and , if so , would she call for them , as they were on her way ? Chesterford , of course , was going , and Jack , and Maud and her mother ; it was quite a small party ; and was n't Jack a dear ? Mrs. Vane had got hold of a certain idea about Mrs. Vivian , distinctly founded on fact . She was one of those women who can not help making an impression . How it is done , or exactly what it is , one would be puzzled to define , but everyone noticed when she came info a room , and was aware when she went out . It was not her personal appearance , for she was short rather than tall , stout rather than graceful , and certainly middle - aged rather than young . Dodo has mentioned the effect she produced on her , and many people felt in the same way that Mrs. Vivian was somehow on a higher plane than they , that her mind was cast in a larger mould . Happily for our peace of mind such people are not very common ; most of our fellow - men are luckily much on the same level , and they are not more than units among units . But Mrs. Vivian was much more than a unit . Dodo had said of her that she was two or three at least . And evidently nothing was further from Mrs. Vivian 's wishes than trying to make an impression , in fact , the very impressive element was rather due to her extreme naturalness . We are most of us so accustomed to see people behave , and to behave ourselves , in a manner not quite natural , that to see anyone who never does so , is in itself calculated to make one rather nervous . Mrs. Vivian evidently intended to take her life up again at the point where she had left off , so to speak — in other words , at the period before her marriage . Of her husband , perhaps , the less said the better . He died , owing to an accident , after ten years of married unhappiness , and left Mrs. Vivian poorer than she had been before . After his death she had travelled abroad for two years , and then returned to England to live with her sister , who had married a rich judge and kept house rather magnificently in Prince 's Gate . Lady Fuller had always disapproved of her sister 's marriage , and she was heartily glad to see her well quit of her husband , and , on her return to England , received her with open arms , and begged her , on behalf of her husband and herself , to make their home hers . Mrs. Vivian accordingly settled down in the "
11137	11523	10098	10098	I	0	" house in Prince 's Gate , and , as I said , took up her life where it had left off . A standing grievance that her husband had had with her was , that she interested herself in the poor , and in the East End slums , that she went to cabmen 's shelters , and espoused the cause of overdriven factory girls . He had told her that it was meddling with other people 's business ; that nothing was so objectionable as an assumption of charitable airs ; that a woman who went to balls and dinner - parties was a hypocrite if she pretended to care about the state of the poor , and that she only did it because she wished to appear unlike other people . But he altogether failed to perceive that her actions were entirely uninfluenced by the impression they were to make , and mistook her extreme naturalness for the subtlest affectation . However , Mrs. Vivian resolutely banished from her mind the remembrance of those ten years , and , being unable to think of her husband with tenderness or affection , she preferred to forget her married life altogether . The Vanes had been their neighbours in the country for many years , and she had known Dodo since she was a child . Dodo had once asked to accompany her in her visits to the East End , and had been immensely struck by what she saw , and determined to be charitable too . This sort of thing seemed extremely chic to Dodo 's observant mind . So she took up a factory of miserable match - girls , and asked them all to tea , and got Mrs. Vivian to promise her help ; but when the afternoon came , Dodo particularly wished to go to a morning concert , and on Mrs. Vivian 's arrival she found , indeed , plenty of match - girls , but no Dodo . Dodo came back later and made herself extremely fascinating . She kissed the cleanest of the girls , and patted the rest on the shoulder , and sang several delightful little French songs to them to her own accompaniment on the banjo , and thanked Mrs. Vivian for being "
11531	11558	10098	10098	I	0	" But on the next occasion when she had nothing to do , and called on Mrs. Vivian to ask to be taken to another of those "
11563	11856	10098	10098	I	0	" Mrs. Vivian hinted that , though she would be charmed to take her , she thought that Dodo had perhaps forgotten that the Four - in - hand Club met that day in Hyde Park . Dodo had forgotten it , and , as she had bespoken the box seat on one of her friends ' coaches , she hurried home again , feeling it freshly borne in upon her that Mrs. Vivian thought she was very contemptible indeed . Altogether Mrs. Vivian knew Dodo well , and when she went home that evening , she thought a good deal about the approaching marriage . She was glad to have had that occasion of speaking to Jack , he seemed to her to be worth doing it for . She knew that she ran the risk of being told , in chillingly polite English , that she was stepping outside her province , and that Jack did not belong to the East End class who welcomed any charitable hand ; but she had a remarkably keen eye , and her intuitive perception told her at once that Jack 's sense of the justice of her remark would stifle any feeling he might have that she was officious and meddlesome , and the event had justified her decision . In the course of the next few days she met Jack several times . They both went to the water - party Dodo spoke of , and she took the opportunity to cultivate his acquaintance . They were sitting on the bank of the river below the Clivedon woods , a little apart from the others , and she felt that as he had behaved so well , she owed him some apology . "
11867	11871	11862	11862	you	394	" she said , "
11959	11963	11945	11945	I	0	" Jack laughed . "
12005	12006	12000	12000	I	0	" "
12011	12015	12000	12000	I	0	" she said . "
12091	12113	12080	12080	you	394	" Jack felt more strongly than ever that this woman could not help being well - bred in whatever she did . "
12125	12129	12122	12122	I	0	" he said , "
12206	12212	12189	12189	Her	79	" Mrs. Vivian looked grave . "
12219	12220	12214	12214	you	0	" "
12225	12229	12214	12214	you	0	" he replied . "
12238	12254	12255	12255	I	0	" Mrs. Vivian 's large , grey , serious eyes twinkled with some slight amusement . "
12270	12274	12262	12262	I	0	" she said ; "
12321	12322	12316	12316	you	405	" "
12331	12335	12325	12325	she	79	" said Jack , "
12355	12363	12344	12346	the last person	406	" Mrs. Vivian looked at him inquiringly . "
12380	12396	12377	12377	I	0	" she said . Jack felt that it could not have been more delicately done . "
12402	12403	12399	12399	you	0	" "
12406	12410	12399	12399	you	0	" she said , "
12493	12681	12487	12487	I	0	" Dodo meanwhile had walked Chesterford off among the green cool woods that bordered the river . She had given Jack 's remarks a good deal of consideration , and , whether or no she felt that he was justified in them on present data , she determined that she would make the event falsify his predictions . Dodo had an unlimited capacity for interfering in the course of destiny . She devoted herself to her aims , whatever they might be , with a wonderful singleness of purpose , and since it is a fact that one usually gets what one wants in this world , if one tries hard enough , it followed that up to this time she had , on the whole , usually got her way . But she was now dealing with an unknown quantity , which she could not gauge . She had confessed to Jack her inability to understand what love meant , and it was with a certain sense of misgiving that she felt that her answers for the future would be expressed in terms of that unknown quantity "
12683	12712	12487	12487	I	0	" To Dodo 's concrete mind this was somewhat discouraging , but she determined to do her best to reduce things to an equation in which the value of "
12714	12941	12487	12487	I	0	" could be found in terms of some of those many symbols which she did know . Dodo had an inexhaustible fund of vivacity , which was a very useful instrument to her ; like a watch - key that fits all watches , she was able to apply it as required to very different pieces of mechanism . When she wished to do honour to a melancholy occasion , for instance , her vivacity turned any slight feeling of sorrow she had into hysterical weeping ; when the occasion was joyful , it became a torrent of delightful nonsense . To - day the occasion was distinctly joyful . She had a large sense of success . Chesterford was really a very desirable lover ; his immense wealth answered exactly the requirements of Dodo 's wishes . Furthermore , he was safe and easily satisfied ; the day was charming ; Jack was there ; she had had a very good lunch , and was shortly going to have a very good tea ; and Chesterford had given orders for his yacht to be in readiness to take them off for a delightful honeymoon , directly after their marriage — in short , all her circumstances were wholly satisfactory . She had said to him after lunch , as they were sitting on the grass , "
12956	13000	12487	12487	I	0	" and he was radiant in consequence , for , to tell the truth , she had been rather indulgent of his company than eager for it the last day or two . She was in the highest spirits as they strolled away . "
13008	13022	13023	13023	I	0	" she said , as soon as they had got out of sight . "
13129	13145	13119	13119	I	0	" To Chesterford this seemed the most attractive nonsense that ever flowed from female lips . "
13157	13162	13148	13148	you	80	" he said simply ; "
13181	13194	13177	13178	other people	2176	" Dodo patted his hand , and blew him a kiss approvingly . "
13200	13204	13177	13178	other people	2176	" she said ; "
13391	13392	13385	13385	you	423	" "
13400	13404	13397	13398	Mrs. Vivian	96	" said he , "
13409	13410	13405	13405	she	96	" "
13419	13423	13414	13414	she	96	" said Dodo . "
13513	13543	13544	13544	I	0	" Chesterford laughed . He had no desire to interrupt this rapid monologue of Dodo 's . He was quite content to play the part of the Greek chorus . "
13552	13556	13544	13544	I	0	" continued Dodo . "
13600	13618	13591	13591	you	427	" He bent over her as she sat with her head back , smiling up at him . "
13622	13626	13628	13628	you	429	" he said , "
13697	13819	13685	13685	you	429	" Dodo was conscious again of the presence of this unknown quantity . She would much prefer striking it out altogether ; it seemed to have quite an unreasonable preponderance . Chesterford did not usually make jokes , in fact she had never heard him make one before , and his remark about standing on his head seemed to be only accounted for by this perplexing factor . Dodo had read about love in poems and novels , and had seen something of it , too , but it remained a puzzle to her . She hoped her calculations might not prove distressingly incorrect owing to this inconvenient factor . But she laughed with her habitual sincerity , and replied , — "
13909	13916	13900	13900	I	0	" Chesterford laughed with pure pleasure . "
13919	13923	13917	13917	Dodo	79	" he said , "
13939	13940	13934	13937	a very good woman	434	" "
13949	13953	13934	13937	a very good woman	434	" said Dodo , "
13994	13995	13983	13983	you	429	" "
14002	14007	13998	13998	you	79	" said he rapturously . "
14012	14072	14010	14010	Dodo	79	" Dodo smiled contentedly . This man was so easy to please . She had felt some slight dismay at Jack 's ill - omened prophecies , but Jack was preposterously wrong about this . They rejoined the others in course of time . Dodo made fearful ravages on the eatables , and after tea she suddenly announced , — "
14090	14095	14085	14085	you	96	" Mrs. Vivian laughed . "
14133	14187	14127	14127	I	0	" Dodo lit a cigarette with a slightly defiant air . Mrs. Vivian 's manner had been entirely sincere , but she felt the same sort of resentment that a prisoner might feel if the executioner made sarcastic remarks to him . She looked on Mrs. Vivian as a sort of walking Inquisition . "
14192	14197	14190	14190	Dodo	79	" murmured Mrs. Vane , "
14215	14222	14225	14225	you	0	" Dodo turned to Mrs. Vivian . "
14241	14242	14225	14225	you	0	" "
14247	14252	14225	14225	you	0	" said that lady . "
14289	14296	14280	14280	I	0	" Dodo leaned back and laughed . "
14305	14309	14310	14310	I	0	" she exclaimed . "
14330	15442	14317	14317	Chesterford	80	" Lord and Lady Chesterford were expected home on the 6th of December . The marriage took place late in August , and they had gone off on the yacht directly afterwards , in order to spend a few warm months in the Mediterranean . Dodo had written home occasionally to Mrs. Vane , and now and then to Jack . To Jack her letters had never been more than a word or two , simply saying that they were enjoying themselves enormously , and that Jack had been hopelessly wrong . Mrs. Vane also had much reason to be satisfied . She had spent her autumn in a variety of fashionable watering - places , where her dresses had always been the awe and wonder of the town ; she had met many acquaintances , to whom she had poured out her rapture over Dodo 's marriage ; had declared that Chesterford was most charming , and that he and Dodo were quite another Adam and Eve in Paradise , and that she was really quite jealous of Dodo . When they left England , they had intended to spend the winter abroad and not come back till February , but early in December a telegram had arrived at Winston , Lord Chesterford 's country house , saying that they would be back in ten days . About the same time Jack received a letter , saying that their change of plans was solely owing to the fact that Dodo was rather tired of the sea , and the weather was bad , and that she had never been so happy in her life . Dodo 's eagerness to assure Jack of this struck him as being in rather bad taste . She ought to have entirely ignored his warnings . The happiness of a newly - married woman ought to be so absorbing , as to make her be unaware of the existence of other people ; and this consciousness in Dodo of her triumphant superiority of knowledge , led him to suppose he was right rather than wrong . He was unfeignedly sorry not to be sure that she had been right . When he told Dodo that he wished to be jealous of Chesterford , he was quite sincere . Since he could not have Dodo himself , at any rate let her make someone happy . Dodo also informed him that they were going to have a house - party that Christmas and that he must come , and she had asked Mrs. Vivian , to show that she was n't afraid of her any longer , and that Maud was coming , and she wished Jack would marry her . Then followed a dozen other names belonging to Dodo 's private and particular set , who had all been rather disgusted at her marrying what they chose to call a Philistine . It had been quite hoped that she would marry Jack . Jack was not a Philistine at all , though the fact of his having proposed to her remained a secret . Maud , on the other hand , was a Philistine ; and it was one of Dodo 's merits that she did not drop those who originally had claims on her , when she became the fashion . She was constantly trying to bring Maud into notice , but Maud resisted the most well - meant shoves . She had none of Dodo 's vivacity and talents ; in fact , her talents lay chiefly in the direction of arranging the places at a dinner - party , and in doing a great deal of unnecessary worsted work . What happened to her worsted work nobody ever knew . It was chiefly remarkable for the predominance of its irregularities , and a suggestion of damaged goods about it , in consequence of much handling . To Dodo it seemed an incredible stupidity that anyone should do worsted work , or , if they did do it , not do it well . She used to tell Maud that it was done much more cheaply in shops , and much better . Then Maud would drop it for a time , and take to playing the piano , but that was even more oppressively stupid to Dodo 's mind than the worsted work . Maud had a perfect genius for not letting her right hand know what her left hand was doing , a principle which was abhorrent to Dodo in every application . The consequence of all this was , that Dodo was apt to regard her sister as a failure , though she still , as in the present instance , liked giving Maud what she considered a helping hand . It must be confessed that Dodo 's efforts were not altogether unselfish . She liked her environment to be as great a success as herself , as it thus added to her own completeness , just as a picture looks better in a good frame than in a shabby one . Maud , however , had no desire to be a success . She was perfectly happy to sit in the background and do the worsted work . She longed to be let alone . At times she would make her escape to the iron works and try to cultivate the domestic virtues in attending to her father . She thought with a kind of envy of the daughters of country clergymen , whose mediocre piano - playing was invaluable to penny readings and village concerts , and for whose worsted work there was a constant demand , in view of old women and almshouses . She had hoped that Dodo 's slumming experiences would bring her into connection with this side of life , and had dispensed tea and buns with a kind of rapture on the occasion of Dodo 's tea - party , but her sister had dropped her slums , as we have seen , at this point , and Maud was too shy and uninitiative to take them up alone . She had an excellent heart , but excellent hearts were out of place in Mrs. Vane 's establishment . Dodo had confessed her inability to deal with them . Dodo 's general invitation to Jack was speedily followed by a special one from Winston , naming the first week in January as the time of the party . Jack was met on his arrival by Chesterford , and as they drove back the latter gave him particulars about the party in the house . "
15450	15454	15456	15456	you	439	" he said . "
15597	15601	15594	15594	I	0	" Jack laughed . "
15606	15610	15602	15604	Poor old fellow	442	" he said , "
15637	15638	15630	15630	I	0	" "
15649	15654	15642	15642	they	438	" said Chesterford ruefully . "
15670	15671	15668	15668	Jack	78	" "
15683	15689	15668	15668	Jack	78	" he said , smiling . "
15698	15699	15693	15696	these dreadfully clever people	446	" "
15801	15805	15791	15792	Bertie Arbuthnot	77	" Jack laughed . "
15815	15819	15806	15806	I	0	" he said . "
15829	15831	15832	15832	Bertie	77	" . "
15840	15844	15832	15832	Bertie	77	" said Chesterford , "
15863	15879	15856	15856	he	77	" They drove on in silence a little way . Then . Chesterford said , — "
16055	16639	16049	16049	he	0	" This communication had only the effect of making Jack rather uncomfortable . Knowing what he did , he knew that this was not all genuine on Dodo 's part . It was obviously an effort to keep it up , to use a vulgar term . And since it was not all genuine , the doubt occurred as to whether any of it was . Jack had a profound belief in Dodo 's dramatic talents . That the need for keeping it up had appeared already was an alarming symptom , but the real tragedy would begin on that day when Dodo first failed to do so . And from that moment Jack regarded his prophecy as certain to be fulfilled . The overture had begun , and in course of time the curtain would rise on a grim performance . They drove up to the door , and entered the large oak - panelled hall , hung all round with portraits of the family . The night was cold , and there was a fire sparkling in the wide , open grate . As they entered , an old collie , who was enjoying the fruits of a well - spent life on the hearthrug , stretched his great , tawny limbs , and shoved a welcoming nose into Chesterford 's hand . This produced heartburnings of the keenest order in the mind of a small fox - terrier pup , who consisted mainly of head and legs , which latter he evidently considered at present more as a preventive towards walking than an aid . Being unable to reach his hand the puppy contented himself with sprawling over his boots , and making vague snaps at the collie . It was characteristic of Chesterford that all animals liked him . He had a tender regard for the feelings of anything that was dependent on him . Dodo thought this almost inexplicable . She disliked to see animals in pain , because they usually howled , but the dumb anguish of a dog who considers himself neglected conveyed nothing to her . From within a door to the right , came sounds of talking and laughter . There was something pathetic in the sight of this beautiful home , and its owner standing with his back to the fire , as Jack divested himself of his coat . Chesterford was so completely happy , so terribly unconscious of what Jack felt sure was going on . He looked the model of the typical English gentleman , with his tall stature and well - bred face . Jack remembered passing on the road a labourer who was turning into his cottage . The firelight had thrown a bright ray across the snow - covered road , and inside he had caught a momentary glimpse of the wife with a baby in her arms , and a couple of girls laying the table - cloth . He remembered afresh Dodo 's remark about waiting until the chimney smoked , and devoutly hoped that the chimney of this well - appointed house was in good order . Chesterford led the way to the drawing - room door , and pushed it open for Jack to enter . Dodo was sitting at the tea - table , talking to some half - dozen people who were grouped round her . As Jack entered , she rose and came towards him with a smile of welcome . "
16644	16648	16642	16642	Jack	78	" she said , "
16715	16736	16708	16708	you	80	" She wheeled a chair up for him , and planted him down in it . He looked radiantly happy . "
16741	16746	16739	16739	Jack	78	" she went on , "
16925	16926	16927	16927	Dodo	79	" "
16938	16949	16950	16950	Dodo	79	" said Chesterford , from the depths of his chair . "
16962	16967	16968	16968	He	78	" Dodo laughed charmingly . "
16981	16986	16968	16968	He	78	" said Dodo dramatically ; "
16999	17078	16988	16988	she	467	" She glanced at Jack for a moment as she said this , but Jack was talking to Miss Grantham , and either did not see , or did not seem to . Jack had a pleasant impression of light hair , dark grey eyes , and a very fair complexion . But somehow it produced no more effect on him than do those classical profiles which are commoner on the lids of chocolate boxes than elsewhere . Her "
17080	17114	16988	16988	she	467	" was sitting in a chair next her , talking to her with something of the air of a showman exhibiting the tricks of his performing bear . His manner seemed to say , "
17121	17155	17117	17119	an intelligent animal	468	" The full sublimity of Lord Ledgers ' remark had not struck him till that moment . Miss Grantham was delivering herself of a variety of opinions in a high , penetrating voice . "
17167	17175	17162	17162	him	469	" she was saying to Lord Ledgers . "
17270	17271	17247	17247	He	469	" "
17283	17294	17272	17272	I	0	" said Lord Ledgers in a smooth , low voice . "
17309	17310	17300	17304	people who do n't cry	472	" "
17321	17326	17315	17319	a horrid , unfeeling monster	473	" remarked Miss Grantham ; "
17388	17389	17385	17386	Mr. Broxton	93	" "
17406	17410	17402	17402	I	0	" said Jack . "
17423	17424	17416	17416	I	0	" "
17445	17460	17441	17441	Dodo	79	" said Miss Grantham , dismissing them lightly with a wave of her hand . "
17514	17515	17487	17487	I	0	" "
17527	17531	17487	17487	I	0	" said Jack . "
17540	17545	17536	17538	all make sacrifices	478	" said Miss Grantham . "

17595	17600	17566	17566	I	0	" said Lord Ledgers . "
17633	17634	17635	17637	Poor old Chesterford	80	" "
17639	17643	17635	17637	Poor old Chesterford	80	" thought Jack , "
17651	17707	17635	17637	Poor old Chesterford	80	" But Chesterford was not to be pitied just now , for Dodo was devoting her exclusive conversation to him in defiance of her duties as hostess . She was recounting to him how she had spent every moment of his absence at the station . Certainly she was keeping it up magnificently at present . "
17716	17721	17709	17710	Mrs. Vivian	96	" she was saying . "
17812	17825	17801	17801	I	0	" Chesterford leant back in his chair in a kind of ecstasy . "
17830	17834	17801	17801	I	0	" he said , "
17883	17887	17888	17888	I	0	" Dodo laughed . "
17952	17959	17960	17960	Dodo	79	" Miss Grantham instantly annexed Dodo . "
17962	17966	17960	17960	Dodo	79	" she said , "
17982	17983	17973	17974	These gentlemen	492	" "
17990	17994	17995	17995	I	0	" corrected Jack . "

18029	18044	17995	17995	I	0	" said Miss Grantham , with the air of a martyr at the stake . "

18108	18112	18099	18099	I	0	" said Maud . "
18132	18142	18122	18122	herself	81	" remarked Dodo incisively . Maud flushed a little . "
18147	18152	18145	18145	Dodo	79	" she exclaimed deprecatingly . "
18160	18165	18158	18158	Maud	81	" said Dodo pensively . "
18187	18188	18182	18182	he	78	" "
18198	18202	18194	18194	you	81	" said Jack , "

18231	18239	18222	18222	I	0	" said Dodo in a low tone . "
18250	18258	18244	18244	you	81	" Jack looked up at her quickly . "
18265	18269	18260	18260	you	81	" he asked . "
18284	18290	18279	18279	I	0	" remarked Miss Grantham calmly . "
18302	18303	18304	18304	I	0	" "
18314	18318	18310	18310	he	78	" said Dodo . "
18447	18939	18431	18431	I	0	" Jack found himself making a quantity of reflections , when he retired to his room that night . He became aware that he had enjoyed himself more that evening than he had done for a very long time . He questioned himself as to when he had enjoyed himself so much , and he was distinctly perturbed to find that the answer was , when he had last spent an evening with Dodo . He had formed an excellent habit of being exactly honest with himself , and he concluded that Dodo 's presence had been the cause of it . It was a very unpleasant blow to him . He had accepted her refusal with an honest determination to get over it . He had not moped , nor pined , nor striven , nor cried . He had no intentions of dying of a broken heart , but the stubborn fact remained that Dodo exercised an unpleasantly strong influence over him . He could have repeated without effort all she had said that night . She had not said anything particularly remarkable , but somehow he felt that the most striking utterances of other men and women would not have produced any such effect on him . It really was very inconvenient . Dodo had married a man who adored her , for whom she did not care two pins ' heads , and this man was one of his oldest friends . Decidedly there was something left - handed about this particular disposition of destiny . And the worst of it was that Chesterford was being hopelessly duped . About that he felt no doubt . Dodo 's acting was so remarkably life - like , that he mistook it at present for reality . But the play must end some time , and the sequel was too dark and involved to be lightly followed out . He could not conceive why this elaborate drama on Dodo 's part did not disgust him more . He wished he had been deceived by it himself , but having been behind the scenes , he had seen Dodo , as it were , in the green - room , putting on the rouge and powder . But failing that , he wished that a wholesome impulse of disgust and contempt had superseded his previous feelings with regard to her . But he believed with her that under the circumstances it was the best thing to do . The marriage was a grand mistake , true , but given that , was not this simply so many weeks of unhappiness saved ? Then he had an immense pity for Dodo 's original mistake . She had told him once that she was no more responsible for her philosophy than for the fact that she happened to be five foot eight in height , and had black eyes and black hair . "
18946	18951	18431	18431	I	0	" she had said ; "
19159	19394	19149	19149	I	0	" Jack felt hopeless against this kind of reasoning , and angry with himself for letting this woman have such dominion over him . In a measure he felt himself capable of views bounded by a horizon not so selfishly fatalistic , and the idea of the smoking chimney in the cottage did not seem to matter , provided that Dodo was sitting on the other side of the hearthrug . He would willingly have sacrificed anything else , to allow himself to give full reins to his thought on this point . But the grand barrier which stood between him and Dodo , was not so much her refusal of him , but the existence of her husband . At this Jack pulled himself up sharp . There are certain feelings of loyalty that still rank above all other emotions . Miss Grantham would certainly have classed such among the litany things . There was nothing heroic about it . It simply consisted in a sturdy refusal to transgress , even in vaguest thought , a code which deals with the most ordinary and commonplace virtues and vices . There is nothing heroic in a street boy passing by the baker 's cart without a grab at the loaves , and it sounds almost puritanical to forbid him to cast a glance at them , or inhale a sniff of their warm fragrance . "
19404	19497	19149	19149	I	0	" thought Jack ; and the worst of it is , that it is not only dull but difficult . With practice most of us could become a Simeon Stylites , provided we are gifted with a steady head , and a constitution that defies showers . It is these commonplace acts of loyalty , the ordinary and rational demands of friendship and society , that are so dreadfully taxing to most of us who have the misfortune not to be born saints . Then Jack began to feel ill - used . "
19533	19957	19513	19513	he	80	" It struck him that his reflections were deplorably commonplace , and that his position ought to be made much more of . He wondered whether this sort of situation was always so flat . In novels there is always a touch of the heroic in the faithful friend who is loyal to his cousin , and steadily avoids his cousin 's wife ; but here he is in identically the same situation , feeling not at all heroic , but only discontented and quarrelsome with this ill - managed world . Decidedly he would go to bed . Owing to a certain habit that he had formed early in life he slept soundly , and morning found him not only alive , but remarkably well and hearty , and with a certain eagerness to follow up what he had thought out on the previous night . He was in an excellently managed household , which imposed no rules on its inhabitants except that they should do what they felt most inclined to do ; he was in congenial company , and his digestion was good . It is distressing how important those material matters are to us . The deeper emotions do but form a kind of background to our coarser needs . We come down in the morning feeling rather miserable , but we eat an excellent breakfast , and , in spite of ourselves , we are obliged to confess that we feel distinctly better . As Jack crossed the hall , he met a footman carrying a breakfast tray into the drawing - room . The door was half open , and there came from within the sounds of vigorous piano - playing , and now and then a bar or two of music sung in a rich , alto voice . These tokens seemed to indicate that Miss Edith Staines was taking her breakfast at the piano . Jack found himself smiling at the thought ; it was a great treat to find anyone so uniformly in character as Miss Staines evidently was . He turned into the dining - room , where he found Miss Grantham sitting at the table alone . Dodo was lolling in a great chair by the fire , and there were signs that Lord Chesterford had already breakfasted . Dodo was nursing a little Persian kitten with immense tenderness . Apparently she had been disagreeing with Miss Grantham on some point , and had made the kitten into a sort of arbitrator . "
19964	19969	19513	19513	he	80	" she was saying , "
20077	20078	20057	20057	Grantie	109	" "
20082	20086	20104	20104	she	104	" asked Jack . "
20224	20225	20218	20218	He	77	" "
20230	20235	20228	20228	Dodo	79	" remarked Miss Grantham , "
20259	20260	20247	20248	Mr. Broxton	93	" "
20268	20276	20277	20277	Jack	78	" said Dodo , with fine candour , "
20284	20285	20277	20277	Jack	78	" "
20292	20296	20277	20277	Jack	78	" said Jack , "
20307	20308	20305	20305	somebody	511	" "
20319	20324	20325	20325	I	0	" said Miss Grantham . "
20341	20357	20337	20338	anybody else	516	" Miss Grantham , it may be noticed , showed some signs of being ruffled : "
20366	20370	20362	20362	Grantie	109	" said Dodo . "
20383	20389	20381	20381	Jack	78	" she added with feeling . "
20394	20399	20392	20392	darling	357	" said Miss Grantham , "
20465	20485	20461	20461	I	0	" Dodo looked up and caught Jack 's eye for a moment . Then she turned to Miss Grantham . "
20528	20529	20526	20526	Jack	78	" "
20546	20550	20538	20538	I	0	" said Jack . "
20563	20588	20553	20553	I	0	" said Miss Grantham , in high , cool tones . At this moment a shrill voice called Dodo from the drawing - room . "
20593	20597	20589	20589	Dodo	79	" it cried , "
20623	20683	20684	20685	Dear Dodo	79	" These remarks were speedily followed up by the appearance of Miss Staines at the dining - room door . In one hand she held the despised eggs , in the other a quire of music paper . Behind her followed a footman with her breakfast - tray , in excusable ignorance as to what was required of him . "
20687	20692	20693	20693	you	79	" she went on , "
20791	20880	20938	20938	you	79	" Edith Staines talked in a loud , determined voice , and emphasised her points with little dashes and nourishes of the dish of poached eggs . At this moment one of them flew on to the floor and exploded . But it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good , and at any rate this relieved the footman from his state of indecision . His immediate mission was clearly to remove it . Dodo threw herself back in her chair with a peal of laughter . "
20887	20891	20938	20938	you	79	" she cried , "
20906	20907	20908	20908	I	0	" "
20915	20919	20908	20908	I	0	" said Edith . "
21101	21102	21094	21094	You	79	" "
21107	21111	21094	21094	You	79	" said Dodo ; "
21255	21256	21237	21237	he	113	" "
21264	21268	21257	21257	Dodo	79	" said Edith . "
21290	21307	21311	21311	you	0	" Edith went back to the drawing - room , whistling in a particularly shrill manner . "
21314	21326	21311	21311	you	0	" said Dodo , who was laughing feebly in her chair . "
21370	21374	21375	21375	She	104	" Jack laughed . "
21391	21395	21398	21398	her	104	" he said . "
21430	21431	21432	21432	He	80	" "
21442	21446	21435	21436	Mrs. Vivian	96	" said Dodo . "
21518	21519	21511	21511	they	537	" "
21531	21536	21520	21520	I	0	" said Miss Grantham . "
21555	21587	21537	21537	They	543	" She had by this time finished her breakfast , and stood warming her back in a gentlemanly manner by the fire . The door opened and Lord Chesterford came in . "
21592	21596	21590	21590	Jack	78	" he said , "
21626	21627	21617	21617	Dodo	79	" "
21634	21638	21632	21632	Edith	104	" remarked Dodo . "
21854	21855	21849	21849	she	104	" "
21863	21867	21858	21858	she	104	" said Chesterford . "
21878	21882	21872	21872	she	104	" remarked Dodo ; "
21900	21942	21943	21943	Bertie	77	" Dodo went across the hall and opened the drawing - room door . Edith was completely absorbed in her work . The grilled bone lay untouched on a small table by the piano . Bertie was sitting before the fire . "
21945	21949	21951	21951	you	77	" said Dodo , "
21955	21961	21951	21951	you	77	" This woke Edith up . "
21968	21972	21951	21951	you	77	" she said . "
21979	22032	21973	21973	Dodo	79	" She ran her hands over the piano , and then broke out into a quick , rippling scherzo . The music flew on , as if all the winds of heaven were blowing it ; then it slowed down , halted a moment , and repeated itself till Dodo burst out : "
22046	22193	22041	22041	I	0	" She wheeled a table out of the way , kicked a chair across the room , and began turning and twisting with breathless rapidity . Her graceful figure looked admirable in the quick movements of her impromptu dance . Bertie thought he had never seen anything so deliciously fresh . Dodo danced with peculiar abandon . Every inch of her moved in perfect time and harmony to the music . She had caught up a thin , Indian shawl from one of the sofas , and passed it behind her back , round her head , this way and that , bending , till at one moment it swept the ground in front of her , at another flew in beautiful curves high above her head , till at last the music stopped , and she threw herself down exhausted in an arm - chair . "
22200	22204	22041	22041	I	0	" she panted . "
22240	22241	22219	22219	I	0	" "

22318	22322	22324	22324	I	0	" said Edith , "
22370	22371	22360	22360	you	104	" "
22382	22384	22378	22378	he	77	" . "
22395	22399	22385	22385	I	0	" said Edith . "
22591	22604	22605	22605	I	0	" Dodo was turning over the leaves of Edith 's score book . "
22610	22616	22605	22605	I	0	" she said at last ; "
22661	22662	22652	22652	you	104	" "
22672	22676	22665	22665	everyone	363	" said Edith , "
22770	22771	22750	22750	you	104	" "
22779	22783	22750	22750	you	104	" said Dodo . "
22802	22803	22804	22804	I	0	" "
22806	22812	22804	22804	I	0	" said Edith with surprise . "
22852	22856	22845	22845	I	0	" Dodo laughed . "
22868	22872	22857	22857	I	0	" she said . "
22881	22882	22873	22873	You	79	" "
22887	22891	22857	22857	I	0	" said Edith ; "
22919	22920	22924	22924	your	79	" "
22937	22938	22924	22924	your	79	" "
23040	23257	23023	23023	Handel	116	" Edith sat down sternly , and buried herself in heir convictions . It was a perfect winter 's day , and when , two hours afterwards , Dodo and the others drove off to meet the shooting - party , the grass in the shadow was still crisp with the light , hoar frost , but where the sun had touched it , the fields were covered with a moist radiance . It had just begun to melt the little pieces of ice that hung from the bare , pendulous twigs of the birch - trees , and send them , shivering to the ground . Through the brown bracken you could hear the startled scuttle of the rabbit , or the quick tapping of a pheasant , who had realised that schemes were on foot against him . A night of hard frost had turned the wheel - ruts into little waves and billows of frozen mud , which the carriage wheels levelled as they passed over them . They caught up the shooting party shortly before lunch , and , as it was cold , Edith and Dodo got out , leaving Miss Grantham , who preferred being cold to walking under any circumstances , to gather up the extra rugs round her . "
23268	23274	23266	23266	Grantie	109	" called Dodo after her , "
23284	23481	23266	23266	Grantie	109	" The sight of abundant game was too much for Edith , and , as Lord Chesterford fell out of line to join Dodo , she asked him if she might have a couple of shots . The keeper 's face expressed some reasonable surprise when he observed Edith snapping the cartridges into her gun with a practised hand . His previous views with regard to women in connection with guns were based upon the idea that most women screamed , when they saw a gun , and considered it a purely unaccountable weapon , which might go off without the least encouragement or warning , and devastate the country for miles round . He was still more surprised when he saw her pick off a couple of pheasants with precision and deadliness of aim . She gave her gun back to Lord Chesterford as they neared the lodge , and volunteered to join them after lunch for an hour , if they did n't mind . Chesterford stole an appealing glance , at Dodo , who , however , only gave him a half - amused , half - pitying look , and nodded assent . "
23488	23492	23266	23266	Grantie	109	" said Edith , "
23568	23572	23563	23563	I	0	" Dodo laughed . "

23821	23827	23808	23809	somebody else	584	" said Dodo , meditatively . "
23978	23998	23999	23999	You	597	" Dodo plucked a piece of dead bracken , and pulled it to bits with a somewhat serious air . "
24007	24011	23999	23999	You	597	" said Edith . "
24087	24088	24081	24081	one	2148	" "

24400	24428	24429	24429	You	104	" Dodo was sitting alone late in the afternoon . The shooting - party had come back , and dispersed to their rooms to wash and dress . "
24437	24446	24448	24448	you	104	" Dodo had said when they came in , "
24471	24500	24465	24465	Edith	104	" Edith had gone up to her room , after insisting on having two of Dodo 's bottles of eau - de - cologne in her hot bath . "
24507	24511	24465	24465	Edith	104	" she said , "
24521	24901	24518	24519	a goddess	610	" Certainly Edith looked anything but a goddess just now . Her hat was pushed rakishly on to the side of her head , there was a suggestion of missing hair - pins about her hair ; she wafted with her about the room a fine odour of tobacco and gunpowder ; she had burned her dress with a fusee head that had fallen off ; her boots were large and unlaced , and curiously dirty , and her hands were black with smoke and oil , and had a sort of trimming in the way of small feathers and little patches of blood . Decidedly , if she came out feeling or looking like a goddess , the prescription ought to want no more convincing testimonial . But she insisted she had never enjoyed herself so much , she talked , and screamed , and laughed as if nothing serious had occurred since breakfast . As Dodo sat in the drawing - room , opening a few letters and skipping all except the shortest paragraphs in the Times , she heard the noise of wheels outside , and hurried into the hall to meet Mrs. Vivian . Somehow she looked forward to Mrs. Vivian 's coming with a good deal of pleasure and interest . She was aware that another strain in the house might be advisable . Bertie and Jack , and Miss Grantham and Edith , were all somewhat on the same lines . Personally , she very much preferred those lines ; and it was chiefly for her husband 's sake that she wanted the new arrival . Lord Chesterford had done his duty nobly , but Dodo 's observant eye saw how great an effort it was to him ; at lunch he had been silent , at tea even more so . Dodo acknowledged that Edith had relieved the party from any sense of the necessity of supporting conversation , but it was obvious to her that Chesterford was hopelessly out of his element , and she felt a keen desire to please him . She had sat by him after lunch , as they smoked and talked , before resuming the shooting , and Dodo had patted his hand and called him a "
24905	25084	24902	24904	dear old darling	611	" when nobody happened to be listening , but she had a distinct sense of effort all day in attending to him , and enjoying the company of the others as much as she wished . There was certainly a want of balance in the party , and Mrs. Vivian 's weight would tend to keep things even . Dodo had even aroused herself to a spasmodic interest in the new curate , but Lord Chesterford had exhibited such unmistakable surprise at this new departure , that she at once fell back on the easier and simpler expedient of blowing smoke rings at him , and drinking out of the same glass by mistake . Mrs. Vivian was extremely gracious , and apparently very much pleased to see Dodo . She kissed her on both cheeks , and shook both her hands , and said what a pleasant drive she had had with dear Maud , and she hoped Lord Chesterford was as well and happy as Dodo appeared to be , and they both deserved to be . "
25097	25101	25095	25095	Dodo	79	" she said , "
25110	25439	25095	25095	Dodo	79	" Dodo was pleased and rather flattered . Apparently Mrs. Vivian had left off thinking she was very small . Anyhow , it was a good thing to have her . Lord Chesterford would be pleased to see her , and he was building some charming almshouses for old women , who appeared to Dodo to be supremely uninteresting and very ugly . Dodo had a deep - rooted dislike for ugly things , unless they amused her very much . She could not bear babies . Babies had no profiles , which seemed to her a very lamentable deficiency , and they were not nearly so nice to play with as kittens , and they always howled , unless they were eating or sleeping . But Mrs. Vivian seemed to revel in ugly things . She was always talking to drunken cabmen , or workhouse people , or dirty little boys who played in the gutter . Dodo 's cometic interest in the East End had been entirely due to her . That lady had a masterly and efficient way of managing , that won Dodo 's immediate admiration , and had overcome for the moment her distaste for the necessary ugliness . Anything masterly always found a sympathetic audience in Dodo . Success was of such paramount importance in her eyes , that even a successful organiser of days in the country for match - girls was to be admired , and even copied , provided the other circumstances of success were not too expensive . Mrs. Vivian was a complete and immediate success on this occasion . Dodo made a quantity of mental notes on the best way to behave , when you have the misfortune to become middle - aged and rather plain . Everyone who already knew her seemed to consider her arrival as the last drop in their cup of happiness . Lord Chesterford , on entering the room , had said , "
25460	25537	25452	25452	We	614	" and he had sat down by her , and quite seemed to forget that Dodo was sitting on the other side of the fire . Jack also had , so to speak , flown into her arms . Dodo immediately resolved to make a friend of her ; a person who could be as popular among the aristocracy as she was among cabmen was distinctly a person to cultivate . She decidedly wanted the receipt . "
25553	25566	25543	25543	you	96	" said Mrs. Vivian , when Dodo went and sat by her . "
25625	25638	25641	25641	I	0	" Dodo was always quick at seeing what was required of her . "
25644	25648	25641	25641	I	0	" she answered . "
25659	25660	25641	25641	I	0	" "
25668	25673	25641	25641	I	0	" said Mrs. Vivian . "
25725	25748	25702	25702	she	377	" She looked across to Lord Chesterford , who was talking to Miss Grantham , and laughing politely at her apostolic jokes . "
25760	25803	25751	25751	Dodo	79	" Dodo felt that this was rather like the ten minutes before dinner . She had a vague idea of telling Chesterford to sound the gong , but she was skilled at glances with meaning , and she resorted to this method . "
25815	25820	25813	25813	you	96	" continued Mrs. Vivian . "
25840	25892	25893	25893	Dodo	79	" At this moment the sound of hurrying feet was heard in the hall . The drawing - room door flew open and Edith entered . Dodo laughed inwardly and hopelessly . Edith began to talk at the top of her voice , before , she was fairly inside the room . "
25897	25901	25895	25895	Dodo	79	" she screamed , "
26007	26008	26009	26010	Mrs. Vivian	96	" "
26016	26034	26012	26014	Miss Edith Staines	104	" remarked Dodo sweetly . There was a moment 's silence , and then Dodo broke down . "
26314	26315	26285	26285	He	111	" "
26321	26326	26285	26285	He	111	" said Mrs. Vivian . "
26428	26429	26432	26432	Dodo	79	" "
26434	26438	26432	26432	Dodo	79	" said Edith , "
26581	26608	26643	26643	Dodo	79	" The practice went off satisfactorily , and Edith expressed herself as pleased . She and Dodo then had a talk to arrange what Dodo called the "
26613	26640	26643	26643	Dodo	79	" Dodo had arranged to read the lessons , and wished to make a small selection of prayers , but there Edith put her foot down . "
26645	26649	26650	26650	you	79	" she said , "
26723	26907	26908	26908	We	657	" It was distinctly news to Dodo that Edith was serious . For herself she had only wished to have a nice little amusement for Sunday morning , which , in Dodo 's experience , was rather a tiresome time if you stopped at home , but on the whole preferable there than at a country church . But Edith was really in earnest whatever she did , whether it was shooting , or music , or playing lawn - tennis . Frivolity , was the one charge she could not brook for a moment . Her amusements might , indeed , be frivolous , but she did them with all her heart . So the service was arranged to consist of a lesson , a Mass , and another lesson . The choice of lessons was left to Dodo . Accordingly , next morning Lord Chesterford and Mrs. Vivian drove off with Maud to eleven o'clock church , leaving the others still at breakfast . After that meal was over Dodo announced she was going to get the drawing - room ready . "
26926	26930	26932	26932	I	0	" she said ; "
27067	27068	27063	27063	I	0	" "
27071	27076	27069	27069	Dodo	79	" broke in Edith , "
27109	27110	27105	27105	I	0	" "
27114	27119	27111	27112	Dear Edith	124	" said Dodo demurely , "
27162	27163	27140	27140	you	660	" "
27171	27176	27164	27164	You	660	" said Edith decidedly . "
27244	27245	27237	27237	I	0	" "
27258	27262	27237	27237	I	0	" said Dodo ; "
27402	27474	27395	27395	I	0	" Dodo completed her arrangements in good time , and forebore to make any more frivolous allusions to the service . She was sitting in the drawing - room , regarding her preparations with a satisfied air , when Herr Truffen was announced . Dodo greeted him in the hall as if it was the most natural thing in the world that he should be called upon to accompany Edith 's Mass. "
27552	27580	27549	27550	Mr. Arbuthnot	126	" Herr Truffen was most gratified by so charming an arrangement , and so great a musical treat . When Edith came down she greeted him effusively . "
27589	27593	27583	27583	Professor	127	" she said . "
27653	27682	27648	27651	not one musical footman	669	" Herr Truffen was a large , spectacled German , who made everyone else look unnecessarily undersized . He laughed and fitted his fingers together with great nicety . "
27690	27694	27695	27696	The congregation	670	" he asked . "
27702	27703	27695	27696	The congregation	670	" "
27711	27715	27708	27709	no congregation	671	" explained Dodo ; "
27745	27746	27731	27731	I	0	" "
27756	27765	27747	27748	Lady Chesterford	100	" remarked Herr Truffen , with elephantine elegance . "
27776	27780	27781	27781	He	80	" continued Dodo . "
27800	27801	27803	27803	you	127	" "
27817	27822	27803	27803	you	127	" said the Professor . "
27827	27831	27803	27803	you	127	" said Dodo ; "
27867	27924	27859	27859	I	0	" Herr Truffen bowed with undiminished composure , and Dodo led the way back into the drawing - room . Miss Grantham and Jack were introduced , and Dodo took her place at the praying - table , and Herr Truffen at the piano . Dodo gave out the lesson , and read the chapter through .. "
27931	27935	27859	27859	I	0	" she exclaimed . "
27953	27954	27949	27949	I	0	" "
27967	27975	27949	27949	I	0	" interrogated Herr Truffen from the piano . "
27992	27993	27949	27949	I	0	" "
28001	28005	27996	27996	Dodo	79	" said Edith . "
28033	28085	28025	28025	you	79	" The Mass had scarcely begun when Lord Chesterford came in , followed by Mrs. Vivian and Maud . The Professor , who evidently did not quite understand that he was merely a sort of organist , got up and shook hands all round with laboured cordiality . Edith grew impatient . "
28088	28092	28025	28025	you	79	" she said , "
28112	28113	28025	28025	you	79	" "
28122	28127	28116	28116	I	0	" remarked the Professor ; "
28153	28219	28025	28025	you	79	" This time the start was made in real earnest . Edith 's magnificent voice , and the Professor 's playing , would alone have been sufficient to make it effective . The four performers knew their parts well , and when it was finished , there followed that silence which is so much more appreciative than applause . Then Herr Truffen turned to Edith . "
28227	28231	28223	28223	you	684	" he said . "
28255	28275	28243	28243	you	684	" As Edith had chiefly written the Mass while smoking cigarettes after a hearty breakfast she merely said , — "
28306	28318	28319	28319	I	0	" Dodo meanwhile had gone back to the praying - table . "
28325	28334	28319	28319	I	0	" she said , in a distracted whisper . "
28351	28352	28353	28353	Dodo	79	" "
28355	28364	28353	28353	Dodo	79	" said Edith , in an awful voice . "
28369	28373	28367	28367	dear	545	" said Dodo . "
28380	28434	28435	28435	Dodo	79	" Dodo read the chapter with infinite feeling in her beautiful clear , full voice . Chesterford was charmed . He had not seen this side of Dodo before . After she had finished , he came and sat by her side , while the others got up and began talking among themselves . "
28437	28441	28435	28435	Dodo	79	" he said , "
28483	28484	28479	28479	you	79	" "
28494	28499	28485	28485	I	0	" said Dodo softly . "
28506	28517	28501	28501	you	79	" She stopped and finished her sentence by a smile . "
28520	28525	28501	28501	you	79	" he said again , "
28560	28628	28553	28553	I	0	" Dodo felt a sudden inclination to laugh . Her æsthetic pleasure in the chapter of Revelation was gone . She felt annoyed and amused at this simple - minded man , who thought her so perfect , and ascribed such fatiguingly high interpretations to all her actions . He really was a little stupid and tiresome . He had broken up all her little pleasant thoughts . "
28640	28649	28635	28635	me	0	" she said , with a half yawn . "
28662	28748	28749	28751	Dear old boy	365	" She got up and joined the other groups , and then suddenly became aware that , for the first time , she had failed in her part . Jack was watching her , and saw what had happened . Chesterford had remained , seated at the window , pulling his long , brown moustache , with a very perceptible shade of annoyance on his face . Dodo felt a sudden impulse of anger with herself at her stupidity . She went back to Chesterford . "
28753	28757	28749	28751	Dear old boy	365	" she said , "
28835	28843	28844	28844	Jack	78	" Then she went across to Jack . "
28846	28855	28844	28844	Jack	78	" she said , in a low voice , "
28867	28878	28861	28861	you	78	" The same afternoon Chesterford took Mrs. Vivian off to see "
28883	29016	28861	28861	you	78	" as Dodo expressed it to Jack . She also told him that Edith and her Herr were playing a sort of chopsticks together in the drawing - room . Maud had , as usual , effaced herself , and Bertie was consuming an alarming number of cigarettes in the smoking - room , and pretending to write letters . It was natural , therefore , that when Jack strolled into the hall , to see what was going on , he should find Dodo there with her toes on the fender of the great fireplace , having banished the collie to find other quarters for himself . Dodo was making an effort to read , but she was not being very successful , and hailed Jack 's entrance with evident pleasure . "
29020	29024	29025	29025	I	0	" she said ; "
29044	29058	29042	29042	Jack	78	" She moved her chair a little aside , and let him pass . "
29074	29078	29064	29066	a merciful providence	702	" she said . "
29098	29131	29064	29066	a merciful providence	702	" she added , as a great gust of wind swept round the corner of the house , and made a deep , roaring sound up in the heart of the chimney . "
29151	29155	29142	29143	Mrs. Vivian	96	" remarked Jack . "
29164	29168	29169	29169	They	704	" said Dodo . "
29242	29243	29234	29234	they	704	" "
29254	29259	29234	29234	they	704	" remarked Jack lazily . "
29268	29273	29274	29274	She	706	" asked Dodo presently . "
29306	29307	29303	29303	I	0	" "
29326	29330	29310	29310	Ledgers	103	" said Jack . "
29347	29348	29344	29345	a class	709	" "
29352	29356	29344	29345	a class	709	" demanded Dodo . "
29379	29380	29344	29345	a class	709	" "
29388	29392	29344	29345	a class	709	" said Dodo . "
29399	29403	29395	29395	you	0	" said he . "
29420	29421	29412	29412	I	0	" "
29432	29438	29424	29424	Jack	78	" said Dodo , reprovingly . "
29447	29451	29452	29452	I	0	" said he . "
29469	29479	29480	29480	I	0	" said Dodo complacently . Jack felt rather disgusted . "
29494	29498	29482	29482	you	0	" he said . "
29515	29516	29499	29499	Your	0	" "
29519	29523	29499	29499	Your	0	" she said , "
29572	29596	29597	29597	I	0	" Dodo turned in her chair and looked Jack full in the face . Her face had a kind of triumph about it . "
29604	29608	29597	29597	I	0	" said Jack . "
29618	29622	29611	29611	I	0	" said Dodo . "
29626	29627	29611	29611	I	0	" "
29633	29638	29611	29611	I	0	" said he gravely , "
29670	29671	29672	29672	Jack	78	" "
29678	29690	29672	29672	Jack	78	" said Dodo , with a certain finality in her tone . "
29733	29765	29727	29727	I	0	" They sat silent a minute or two , until a door at the far end of the hall opened and Miss Grantham came through , with her showman in tow . "
29776	29781	29769	29769	I	0	" said Miss Grantham , "
29839	29840	29841	29841	I	0	" "
29848	29856	29841	29841	I	0	" said Dodo , with grave consideration . "
29917	29918	29871	29871	you	78	" "
29929	29934	29935	29935	Jack	78	" said Miss Grantham . "
29943	29947	29935	29935	Jack	78	" said Dodo . "
29958	29963	29948	29948	I	0	" said Miss Grantham . "
29977	29978	29979	29979	Jack	78	" "
29992	30007	29979	29979	Jack	78	" said Dodo , broadly . Miss Grantham was staring pensively at the fire . "
30018	30022	30024	30024	they	718	" she said , "
30094	30095	30084	30084	you	93	" "

30138	30206	30118	30118	I	0	" said Miss Grantham . Lord Ledgers was leaning back in his chair with a sense of pleased proprietorship . It really was a very intelligent animal . Jack almost expected him to take a small whip from his pocket and crack it at her . But his next remark , Jack felt , was a good substitute ; at any rate , he demanded another performance . "
30214	30218	30211	30212	Miss Grantham	105	" he said . "
30227	30231	30232	30232	Madmen	723	" she said . "
30268	30269	30270	30270	Grantie	109	" "
30282	30286	30274	30274	you	109	" said Dodo . "
30370	30380	30339	30339	She	104	" Lord Ledgers laughed a low , unpleasant laugh . "
30386	30446	30339	30339	She	104	" he murmured . The remark was inaudible to all but Jack . He felt quite unreasonably angry with him , and got up from his chair . Dodo saw something had happened , and looked at him inquiringly . Jack did not meet her eye , but whistled to the collie , who flopped down at his feet . "
30464	30469	30470	30470	I	0	" said Miss Grantham . "

30860	30864	30853	30853	you	0	" said Dodo . "

30952	30958	30948	30948	I	0	" said Miss Grantham meditatively . "
30965	31038	30962	30963	Eugene Aram	130	" Jack was acutely uncomfortable , but he had the satisfaction of believing that what Dodo said about him was true . He had come to the same conclusion himself two nights ago . He believed that he would stop short of any act of disloyalty , but he did not care about hearing Dodo give him so gratuitous a testimonial before Miss Grantham and the gentleman whom he mentally referred to as "
31045	31123	31042	31043	a showman	2279	" The front door opened , and a blast of cold wind came blustering round into the inner hall where they were sitting , making the thick tapestry portière belly and fill like a ship 's sail , when the wind first catches it . The collie pricked his ears , and thumped his tail on the floor with vague welcome . Mrs. Vivian entered , followed by Lord Chesterford . He looked absurdly healthy and happy . "
31131	31141	31142	31143	Mrs. Vivian	96	" he said cheerfully , advancing to the fireplace . "
31171	31172	31169	31169	Dodo	79	" "
31178	31184	31169	31169	Dodo	79	" said Dodo to Jack . "
31196	31200	31186	31186	Jack	78	" asked Chesterford . "
31203	31207	31186	31186	Jack	78	" said Dodo . "
31230	31235	31236	31236	You	96	" Mrs. Vivian laughed . "
31255	31256	31236	31236	You	96	" "
31269	31274	31258	31258	you	0	" asked Miss Grantham . "
31280	31296	31258	31258	you	0	" said . Jack , with the air of helping her out of a difficulty . "
31306	31311	31312	31312	Chesterford	80	" remarked Lord Ledgers . "
31338	31342	31314	31314	I	0	" Dodo groaned . "
31357	31358	31345	31345	Chesterford	80	" "
31369	31378	31366	31367	Mrs. Vivian	96	" asked Miss Grantham . Mrs. Vivian considered . "
31390	31394	31430	31430	she	96	" she said ; "
31408	31409	31430	31430	she	96	" "
31420	31425	31426	31426	She	96	" murmured Miss Grantham . "
31449	31450	31436	31436	I	0	" "
31464	31471	31491	31491	labourers	746	" said Dodo to Mrs. Vivian , "
31539	31551	31536	31537	a thief	750	" Chesterford looked a trifle puzzled . Dodo turned to him . "
31556	31560	31562	31562	they	752	" she said , "
31586	31600	31601	31601	You	751	" She got up from her chair , and pulled Chesterford 's moustache . "
31609	31613	31607	31607	Chesterford	80	" she said . "
31683	31703	31679	31681	a dripping sop	757	" Mrs. Vivian pleaded guilty , and vanished . Sounds of music still came from the drawing - room . "
31715	31719	31720	31720	She	104	" remarked Dodo . "
31765	32453	32454	32454	Dodo	79	" Edith 's music was strongly exciting , and in the pause that followed , Dodo went to the door and opened it softly , and a great tangle of melody poured out and filled the hall . She was playing the last few pages of the overture to an opera that she had nearly completed . The music was gathering itself up for the finale . Note after note was caught up , as it were , to join an army of triumphant melody overhead , which grew fuller and more complete every moment , and seemed to hover , waiting for some fulfilment . Ah , that was it . Suddenly from below crashed out a great kingly motif , strong with the strength of a man who is pure and true , rising higher and higher , till it joined the triumph overhead , and moved away , strong to the end . There was a dead silence ; Dodo was standing by the door , with her lips slightly parted , feeling that there was something in this world better and bigger , perhaps , than her own little hair - splittings and small emotions . With this in her mind , she looked across to where Chesterford was standing . The movement was purely instinctive , and she could neither have accounted for it , nor was she conscious of it , but in her eyes there was the suggestion of unshed tears , and a look of questioning shame . Though a few bars of music can not change the nature of the weakest of us , and Dodo was far from weak , she was intensely impressionable , and that moment had for her the germ of a possibility which might — who could say it could not?—have taken root in her and borne fruit . The parable of the mustard seed is as - old and as true as time . But Chesterford was not musical ; he had taken a magazine from the table , and was reading about grouse disease . Dodo was sitting in a remarkably easy - chair in her own particular room at the house in Eaton Square . As might have been expected , her room was somewhat unlike other rooms . It had a pale orange - coloured paper , with a dado of rather more intense shade of the same colour , an orange - coloured carpet and orange - coloured curtains . Dodo had no reason to be afraid of orange colour just yet . It was a room well calculated to make complete idleness most easy . The tables were covered with a mass of albums , vases of flowers , and a quantity of entirely useless knick - knacks . The walls were hung with several rather clever sketches , French prints and caricatures of Dodo 's friends . A small bookcase displayed a quantity of flaring novels and a large tune hymn - book , and in a conspicuous corner was Dodo 's praying - table , on which the skull regarded its surroundings with a mirthless and possibly contemptuous grin . The mantelpiece was entirely covered with photographs , all signed by their prototypes . These had found their quarters gradually becoming too small for them , and had climbed half way up the two - sides of a Louis Quinze mirror , that formed a sort of overmantel . The photographs were an interesting study , and included representatives from a very wide range of classes . No one ever accused Dodo of being exclusive . In the corner of the room were a heap of old cotillion toys , several hunting - whips , and a small black image of the Virgin , which Dodo had picked up abroad . Above her head a fox 's mask grinned defiantly at another fox 's brush opposite . On the writing table there was an inkstand made of the hoof of Dodo 's favourite hunter , which had joined the majority shortly after Christmas , and the "
32455	32567	32568	32568	I	0	" symphony , which had just come out with great éclat at the Albert Hall , leant against the wall . A banjo case and a pair of castanets , with a dainty silver monogram on them , perhaps inspired Dodo when she sat down to her writing - table . Dodo 's hands were folded on her lap , and she was lazily regarding a photograph of herself which stood oh the mantelpiece . Though the afternoon was of a warm day in the end of May , there was a small fire on the hearth which crackled pleasantly . Dodo got up and looked at the photograph more closely . "
32573	32579	32568	32568	I	0	" she thought to herself , "
32643	32810	32636	32637	Mrs. Vivian	96	" Dodo had made great friends with Mrs. Vivian during the last months . Her sister and brother - in - law had been obliged to leave England for a month at Easter , and Dodo had insisted that Mrs. Vivian should spend it with them , and to - day was the first day that the doctor had let her come down , and she had written to Jack and Mrs. Vivian to come and have tea with her . A tap was heard at the door , and the nurse entered , bearing the three weeks ' old baby . Dodo was a little disappointed ; she had seen a good deal of the baby , and she particularly wanted Mrs. Vivian . She stood with her hands behind her back , without offering to take it . The baby regarded her with large wide eyes , and crowed at the sight of the fire . Really it was rather attractive , after all . "
32816	32820	32813	32814	Lord Harchester	131	" remarked Dodo , "
32868	32900	32866	32866	baby	764	" She held out her arms to take it , but his lordship apparently did not approve of this change . He opened his mouth in preparation for a decent protest . "
32916	32920	32911	32911	you	131	" said Dodo ; "
32972	32986	32966	32966	you	131	" Dodo nodded at the baby with the air of a slight acquaintance . "
32997	33001	33002	33002	you	131	" she said ; "
33044	33052	33036	33036	I	0	" she went on to Mrs. Vivian . "
33067	33068	33055	33056	his lordship	2436	" "
33072	33077	33069	33070	Dear Dodo	79	" said Mrs. Vivian , "

33106	33110	33100	33100	I	0	" said Dodo , "
33145	33153	33137	33137	I	0	" she continued ; pouring out tea . "
33207	33208	33203	33203	he	78	" "
33211	33217	33224	33224	he	78	" said Mrs. Vivian softly , "

33230	33234	33224	33224	he	78	" said Dodo , "
33318	33328	33316	33316	him	78	" Mrs. Vivian sipped her tea reflectively without answering . "
33337	33342	33343	33343	He	80	" Dodo went on . "
33404	33414	33415	33415	I	0	" Mrs. Vivian did not seem to be listening . "
33422	33426	33427	33427	he	93	" she said ; "
33455	33456	33442	33442	he	93	" "
33468	33475	33476	33476	He	78	" said Dodo , rather petulantly . "
33529	33538	33518	33518	I	0	" There was another tap at the door . "
33543	33547	33548	33548	he	80	" remarked Dodo , "
33575	33591	33592	33592	Jack	78	" The tap came again , and after a moment 's interval the door opened . "
33594	33628	33592	33592	Jack	78	" exclaimed Dodo . She got up from her chair and went quickly towards him . Jack was pale , and his breath came rather short , as if he had been running . "
33633	33637	33631	33631	Dodo	79	" he cried , "
33656	33668	33647	33647	I	0	" He broke off rather lamely , and greeted Mrs. Vivian . "
33673	33677	33669	33671	Dear old Jack	78	" said Dodo , "
33803	33937	33800	33800	you	78	" Dodo was conscious of quite a fresh tide of interest in her life . Her intellectual faculties , she felt , had been neglected . She could not conceive why , because she had a husband and baby , she should be supposed not to care for other interests as well . Chesterford was an excellent husband , with a magnificent heart ; but Dodo had told herself so often that he was not very clever , that she had ceased trying to take an intellectual pleasure in his society , and the baby could not be called intellectual by the fondest parent at present . There were a quantity of women who were content to pore on their baby 's face for hour after hour , with no further occupation than saying "
33939	33963	34107	34107	You	792	" occasionally . Dodo had given what she considered a fair trial to this treatment , and she found it bored her to say "
33965	34106	34107	34107	You	792	" for an indefinite period , and she did not believe it amused the baby . She had a certain pride in having given birth to the son and heir of one of the largest English properties , and she was extremely glad to have done so , and felt a certain pleased sort of proprietorship in the little pink morsel , but she certainly had experienced none of the absorbing pleasures of maternity . She had got used to not being in love with her husband , and she accepted as part of this same deficiency the absence of absorbing pleasure in the baby . Not that she considered it a deficiency , it was merely another type turned out of Nature 's workshop . Dodo laid all the blame on Nature . She shrugged her shoulders and said : "
34121	34409	34410	34410	You	793	" But Dodo was aware that Nature had given her a brain , and she found a very decided pleasure in the company of clever people . Perhaps it was the greatest pleasure of her life to be admired and amused by clever people . Of course Chesterford always admired her , but he was in love with her , and he was not clever . Dodo had felt some difficulty before her marriage in dealing with this perplexing unknown quantity , and she had to confess it puzzled her still . The result was , that when it occurred , she had to admit her inability to tackle it , and as soon as possible to turn to another page in this algebra of life . But she still felt that her marriage had been a great success . Chesterford had entirely fulfilled what she expected of him : he was immensely rich , he let her do as she liked , he adored her . Dodo quite felt that it was better that he should adore her . As long as that lasted , he would be blind to any fault of hers , and she acknowledged that , to a man of Chesterford 's character , she must seem far from faultless , if he contemplated her calmly . But he was quite unable to contemplate her calmly . For him she walked in a golden cloud that dazzled and entranced him . Dodo was duly grateful to the golden cloud . But she felt that the element which Jack , and Mrs. Vivian , and other friends of hers brought , had been conspicuously absent , and she welcomed its return with eagerness . "
34423	34427	34410	34410	You	793	" Dodo continued . "
34527	34541	34542	34542	I	0	" Dodo let her arms drop beside her with a little hopeless gesture . "
34567	34572	34576	34581	that woman in the moated Grange	800	" she went on . "
34750	34754	34740	34740	I	0	" Jack laughed . "
34762	34766	34767	34767	I	0	" he said . "
34787	34788	34780	34780	I	0	" "
34796	34800	34780	34780	I	0	" said Dodo , "
34957	34972	34947	34948	You two	812	" Mrs. Vivian felt a sudden impulse of anger , which melted into pity . "
34976	34980	34947	34948	You two	812	" she said , "
35029	35030	34947	34948	You two	812	" "
35043	35052	34947	34948	You two	812	" said Dodo , pouring out another cup . "
35193	35198	35199	35199	You	79	" Mrs. Vivian laughed . "
35214	35218	35212	35212	Dodo	79	" she said . "

35237	35241	35242	35242	They	819	" said Jack . "

35302	35306	35296	35296	I	0	" said Dodo . "

35361	35366	35358	35359	Poor baby	827	" said Mrs. Vivian , "

35387	35391	35381	35381	I	0	" said Dodo . "
35536	35588	35591	35591	Jack	78	" Jack was conscious of a keen resentment at Dodo 's words . He had accepted her decision , but he did n't like to have it flaunted before him in Dodo 's light voice and careless words . He made an uneasy movement in his chair . Dodo saw it . "
35598	35602	35593	35593	I	0	" she said ; "
35671	35716	35668	35668	Jack	78	" Chesterford saw the fresh light in her eyes , and the fresh vivaciousness in her speech , and he was so unfeignedly glad to see her more herself again , that no thought of jealousy entered his heart . He thought without bitterness , "
35752	35765	35746	35746	Dodo	79	" He shook hands with Jack , and beamed delightedly on Dodo . "
35778	35782	35766	35766	Jack	78	" he said ; "
35803	35804	35807	35807	he	2020	" "
35812	35816	35807	35807	he	2020	" said she , "
35853	35864	35865	35865	I	0	" Lord Chesterford looked disappointed , but ac - quiesced . "
35876	35880	35868	35868	Jack	78	" he remarked . "
35889	35890	35882	35882	he	78	" "
35900	35904	35893	35893	Jack	78	" said Dodo , "

35942	35946	35932	35932	I	0	" said Jack , "

35997	36009	36010	36010	Jack	78	" said Dodo rather querulously , as they left the room . "
36082	36092	36076	36076	Jack	78	" Dodo lay back in her chair and reflected . "
36101	36110	36093	36093	You	0	" said Mrs. Vivian , with a laugh . "
36131	36138	36122	36122	he	581	" Dodo looked a little anxious . "
36147	36151	36145	36145	he	581	" she asked . "
36179	36180	36161	36161	he	581	" "
36191	36196	36185	36185	he	581	" said Mrs. Vivian . "
36207	36214	36185	36185	he	581	" Dodo grew a trifle impatient . "
36225	36229	36185	36185	he	581	" she said . "
36268	36275	36258	36258	You	0	" Mrs. Vivian rose to go . "
36283	36287	36278	36278	I	0	" she said . "
36336	36342	36329	36330	Lord Chesterford	80	" Dodo looked up inquiringly . "
36352	36356	36329	36330	Lord Chesterford	80	" she said , "
36386	36403	36377	36377	I	0	" Mrs. Vivian stood looking out of the window . Her eyes suddenly filled with tears . "
36416	36503	36504	36504	They	850	" she said . Dodo wondered , when she had gone , what made her so suddenly grave . Her own horizon was singularly free from clouds . She had been through an experience which she had looked forward to with something like dread . But that was over ; she and the baby were both alive and well . Chesterford was more devoted than ever , and she?—well , she was thoroughly satisfied . And Jack had come back , and all was going delightfully . "
36517	36521	36504	36504	They	850	" she thought . "
36558	36569	36570	36570	I	0	" The door opened softly , and Chesterford came in . "
36580	36584	36570	36570	I	0	" he said , "
36613	36620	36621	36622	The baby	283	" Dodo smiled benignantly on him . "
36627	36631	36632	36632	It	283	" he continued . "
36662	36663	36656	36656	you	0	" "
36671	36675	36666	36666	I	0	" said Dodo ; "

36691	36701	36666	36666	I	0	" he went on , not noticing her tone . "
36714	36715	36706	36706	I	0	" "
36724	36728	36706	36706	I	0	" said Dodo . "
36739	36740	36735	36735	I	0	" "
36749	36753	36741	36741	It	283	" said he , "
36759	36765	36741	36741	It	283	" Dodo laughed rather wearily . "
36774	36778	36767	36767	you	0	" he said . "
36809	36810	36798	36798	you	0	" "
36822	36826	36813	36813	I	0	" said Dodo . "
36843	36854	36840	36840	Wilkins	134	" He bent over her and kissed her forehead softly . "
36863	36875	36840	36840	Wilkins	134	" he whispered . Dodo lay with half - shut eyes . "
36882	37043	36880	36880	dear	545	" she said languidly . The questions about which a man is apt to , say that he alone can judge , are usually exactly those questions in which his judgment is most likely to be at fault , for they concern him very intimately — a truth which he expresses by saying that he alone can judge about them , and for that very reason his emotions are apt to colour what he considers his sober decision . Jack was exactly in this position when he left the Chesterfords ' door that afternoon . It was only six o'clock when he went away , and he wished to be alone , and to think about it . But the house seemed stuffy and unsuggestive , and he ordered a horse , and sat fuming and frowning till it came round . It fidgeted and edged away from the pavement when he tried to mount it , and he said , "
37050	37340	37047	37047	you	860	" with remarkable emphasis , and asked the groom whether he had n't yet learned to hold a horse quiet . This was sufficient to show that he was in a perturbed frame of mind . The Row was rather empty , for a great race meeting was going on , and Jack cantered quickly up to the end , and cursed his stupidity for not having gone to Sandown . Then he put his horse to a quiet pace , and determined to think the matter out . He had left the Chesterfords in January with a full realisation of his position . He was in love with Dodo , perhaps more deeply than ever , and Dodo was hopelessly , irrevocably out of his reach . The only thing left to be done was to get over it ; but his ordinary circle and its leisurely duties were quite impossible just at present , and he adopted the traditional English method of travelling , and shooting unoffending animals . Whether the absence of faith was responsible , is an open question ; at any rate , the remedy did not result in a cure . He was intensely bored with foreign countries ; they were quite as distasteful as England , and , on the whole , had less to offer . And he came back to London again as suddenly as he had left it . He only remembered one incident in his four months abroad which gave him any pleasure ; that was when he received a letter from Dodo at Berlin , which said nothing particular , and wound up with a little mild chaff on the absurdity of his going abroad at all . "
37348	37352	37341	37341	I	0	" wrote Dodo , "
37404	37960	37961	37961	Bertie	77	" Of course he came back ; it was no good remaining abroad , and yawning in front of the Sistine Madonna , who , in her impossible serene mildness , had no message whatever for him . He wanted to see Dodo ; why on earth should n't he ? She was the only thing he really cared about , and she was quite out of his reach . Where was the harm ? For two days after his arrival in London he was still undecided , and made no effort to see her , and on the third day her note came . London was as bad as Dresden , and again , where was the harm ? He wrote a note saying he would come , then he tore that up and sent a refusal , offering no excuse ; and after all , he had gone , and parted from her with the words that he would come again the next day . But ah , how sweet it was to see her again ! Such were the facts upon which Jack wished to form a conclusion . All this indecision was really too annoying . What was the use of a conscience that took the sugar out of your tea , and yet could not prevent you from drinking it ? It was not strong enough to prevent him going to see Dodo , and it took the malicious line of making the visit as little enjoyable as possible . Well , it must be settled one way or the other . The problem obviously depended on one question . Did his desire for Dodo grow stronger with seeing her ? He decided that it did not make much difference to the quality or degree of his longing , but , on the other hand , her society gave him an inestimable pleasure . When she had refused him a year ago , he had gone on seeing her day after day , without the horrible , unsatisfied emptiness he had felt abroad . That absorbing craving for her , he remembered , began when she was on her wedding tour . Then why not see her freely and frequently ? No harm could possibly come out of it . Dodo , he thought , cared for him only as she cared for a dozen other friends , why should he , then , who cared so deeply for her , cut himself off from her ? Again his deep - rooted affection and respect for her husband was an immense safeguard . Quixotism was a doubtful virtue at the best , and decidedly out of date , and besides , what would Dodo think if she suddenly found that one of her best friends invariably declined to meet her under any circumstances ? She would certainly guess the reason , and if there was one possible solution of this stupid problem more undesirable than another , it was that . And Jack made up his mind . Well , that was settled , and here was Bertie riding down upon him . He felt as if he wished to record a deliberate and sober conclusion . They joined forces and rode up together . Then Jack said suddenly , — "
37978	37979	37973	37973	I	0	" "
37984	38029	37973	37973	I	0	" said Bertie placidly . There was something indefinably soothing about Bertie 's manner . Jack determined to be more explicit . It is often a relief to tell a friend one 's own resolutions , especially if one does not expect unseasonable objections . "
38035	38039	38040	38040	You	77	" he said . "
38056	38057	38048	38048	her	79	" "
38060	38074	38048	38048	her	79	" said Bertie , without a shade of emotion passing over his face . "
38083	38087	38048	38048	her	79	" said Jack , "
38153	38168	38170	38170	you	0	" They rode on a little time in silence . Then Bertie said , — "
38175	38176	38170	38170	you	0	" "
38181	38187	38170	38170	you	0	" said Jack rather dubiously . "
38199	38203	38197	38197	Jack	78	" he said . "
38213	38220	38197	38197	Jack	78	" But Jack broke in , — "
38308	38309	38305	38306	a rascal	867	" "
38316	38320	38310	38310	I	0	" said Bertie . "
38368	38369	38370	38370	I	0	" "
38373	38377	38370	38370	I	0	" said Jack , "
38413	38414	38415	38415	I	0	" "
38421	38565	38415	38415	I	0	" repeated Bertie stolidly . Jack went to see Dodo the next afternoon , and for many afternoons during the next fortnight he might have been seen on Chesterford 's doorstep , either coming or going . Her husband seemed almost as glad as Dodo that Jack should come often . His visits were obviously very pleasant to her , and she had begun to talk nonsense again as fluently as ever . With Jack , however , she had some rather serious talks ; his future appeared to be exercising her mind somewhat . Jack 's life at this time was absolutely aimless . Before he had gone abroad he had been at the Bar , and had been called , but his chambers now knew him no more . He had no home duties , being , as Dodo expressed it , "
38575	38680	38415	38415	I	0	" and he had enough money for an idle bachelor life . Dodo took a very real interest in the career of her friends . It was part of her completeness , as I have said before , to be the centre of a set of successful people . Jack could do very well , she felt , in the purely ornamental line , and she by no means wished to debar him from the ornamental profession , but yet she was vaguely dissatisfied . She induced him one day to state in full , exactly the ideas he had about his own future . "
38687	38693	38681	38681	You	871	" she said to him , "
38748	38927	38729	38729	she	137	" Jack was silent a few minutes . The truth of the matter was that he was becoming so preoccupied with Dodo , that he was acquiring a real distaste for other society . His days seemed to have dwindled down to an hour or two hours each , according to the time he passed with Dodo . The interval between his leaving the house one day and returning to it the next , had got to be merely a tedious period of waiting , which he would gladly have dispensed with . In such intervals society appeared to him not a distraction , but a laborious substitute for inaction , and labour at any time was not congenial to him . His life , in fact , was a series of conscious pulses with long - drawn pauses in between . He was dimly aware that this sort of thing could not go on for ever . The machine would stop , or get quicker or slower , and there were endless complications imminent in either case . "
38939	38944	38933	38933	I	0	" said Jack discontentedly . "
38958	38959	38933	38933	I	0	" "
38972	38976	38962	38962	you	871	" said Dodo . "
39128	39129	39112	39112	he	876	" "
39142	39146	39133	39133	I	0	" remarked Jack . "
39151	39155	39147	39147	You	0	" said Dodo ; "
39175	39176	39169	39169	I	0	" "
39186	39219	39177	39177	I	0	" said Jack , with a touch of irritation . Dodo looked up rather surprised at the hard ring in his voice . She thought it wiser to ignore this last remark . "
39233	39237	39220	39220	I	0	" she said . "
39262	39263	39241	39241	you	78	" "
39269	39273	39241	39241	you	78	" suggested Jack . "
39337	39338	39339	39339	I	0	" "
39353	39357	39358	39358	Anyone	343	" said Jack . "
39422	39423	39416	39416	I	0	" "
39430	39437	39416	39416	I	0	" asked Dodo . Jack considered . "
39442	39446	39447	39447	You	78	" he said . "
39719	39720	39714	39714	I	0	" "
39727	39731	39714	39714	I	0	" said Dodo ; "
39803	39804	39841	39841	you	78	" "
39815	39819	39841	39841	you	78	" said he . "
39837	39838	39841	39841	you	78	" "
39846	39850	39841	39841	you	78	" said Dodo . "
39885	39886	39871	39871	you	78	" "
39897	39901	39887	39887	I	0	" said Jack . "
39907	39908	39904	39904	you	0	" "
39918	39919	39904	39904	you	0	" "
39935	39939	39929	39929	you	0	" demanded Dodo . "
39942	40008	39929	39929	you	0	" Jack was rather uncomfortable . He wanted to say more , and wished he had n't said so much . He wondered how Dodo would take it . Dodo did not take it at all . She was , for the time at any rate , much more interested in Jack 's prospects as they concerned him , than as they bore on herself . "
40018	40079	40080	40080	My	0	" she asked . Jack hardly knew whether to feel relieved or slighted . Was Dodo 's apparent unconsciousness of the tenor of what he had said genuine or affected ? On that he felt a great deal depended . But whether it was genuine or not , the matter was closed for the present . Dodo repeated her question . "
40092	40096	40080	40080	My	0	" he asked . "
40101	40105	40080	40080	My	0	" said Dodo ; "
40127	40128	40129	40129	My	0	" "
40139	40146	40133	40133	you	0	" said he . Dodo laughed . "
40154	40158	40149	40149	I	0	" she said ; "
40198	40199	40195	40195	Chesterford	80	" "
40208	40287	40203	40203	Chesterford	80	" said Jack . June was drawing to a close in a week of magnificent weather . It was too hot to do much during the middle of the day , and the Park was full of riders every morning from eight till ten . Dodo ' was frequently to be seen there , usually riding a vicious black mare , that plunged and shied more than Lord Chesterford quite liked . But Dodo insisted on riding it . "
40299	40304	40195	40195	Chesterford	80	" she told him , "
40327	40445	40321	40321	I	0	" On this particular morning Dodo descended the stairs feeling unusually happy . The period of enforced idleness was over , and she was making up for lost time with a vengeance . They had given a dance the night before , and Dodo had not gone to bed till after four ; but for all that she was down again at half - past eight , and her mare was waiting for her . She turned into the dining - room to have a cup of tea before starting , and waited somewhat impatiently for Lord Chesterford to join her . He came in , in the course of a few minutes , looking rather worried . "
40460	40464	40450	40450	you	922	" said Dodo , "
40523	40524	40525	40525	I	0	" "
40530	40534	40525	40525	I	0	" said he , "
40577	40584	40574	40575	the doctor	2431	" Dodo felt a little impatient . "
40592	40596	40574	40575	the doctor	2431	" she said . "
40696	40697	40683	40683	She	141	" "
40708	40715	40699	40699	you	0	" said he , still wavering . "
40748	40749	40739	40739	she	2432	" "
40755	40759	40752	40752	you	0	" said Dodo . "
40793	40821	40785	40785	I	0	" Dodo went off perfectly at ease in her mind . Chesterford was rather fussy , she thought , and she congratulated herself on not being nervous . "
40837	40843	40829	40829	I	0	" she said to herself . "
40855	40953	40829	40829	I	0	" She put her horse into a quick trot , and felt a keen enjoyment in managing the vicious animal . The streets were somewhat crowded even at this hour , and Dodo had her work cut out for her . However , she reached the Park in safety , and went up the Row at a swinging gallop , with her horse tearing at the rein and tossing its head . After a time the brute grew quieter , and Dodo joined a well - known figure who was riding some way in front of her . "
40958	40962	40954	40956	Good old Jack	78	" she cried , "
41165	41169	41157	41157	he	80	" Jack laughed . "
41181	41185	41173	41173	you	946	" he said . "
41215	41216	41205	41205	You	946	" "
41226	41231	41219	41219	you	946	" said Dodo calmly . "
41275	41276	41265	41265	You	78	" "
41288	41292	41282	41283	the boy	2020	" said Jack , "
41312	41313	41304	41304	you	78	" "
41327	41331	41321	41321	I	0	" asked Dodo . "
41348	41354	41334	41334	I	0	" said Jack , laughing , "
41369	41370	41361	41361	I	0	" "
41376	41380	41381	41381	you	78	" said Dodo ; "
41714	41730	41703	41703	I	0	" Jack was , rather pale , and his fingers twitched nervously at his reins . "
41738	41747	41732	41732	you	0	" he asked , in a low voice . "
41752	41756	41757	41757	you	78	" said Dodo , "
41864	41876	41856	41856	you	78	" There was a long pause . Then Jack said , — "
41888	41991	41992	41992	You	78	" The moment after he had said it , he would have given his right hand to have it unsaid . Dodo was silent for a moment , and Jack found himself noticing the tiny , trivial things about him . He observed a fly trying to alight oh his horse 's ear , but the animal flicked it off with a little jerk , before it got fairly settled . He wondered whether the fly had illusions about that ear , and whether it imagined that it would be happy for ever and ever , if it could once settle there . "
42006	42010	41992	41992	You	78	" said Dodo . "
42089	42134	42080	42080	I	0	" Then Jack recovered his self - respect in a moment , by one of those strange contradictions in our nature , which urged him to stop his ears to what , a week before , he had been almost tempting her to say . "
42141	42145	42080	42080	I	0	" he said , "
42166	42167	42168	42168	Chesterford	80	" "
42173	42178	42168	42168	Chesterford	80	" said Dodo softly . "
42227	42252	42193	42193	Jack	78	" Dodo half turned towards him , with a long glance in her brown eyes , and a little smile playing about her mouth . "
42257	42264	42265	42265	I	0	" said Jack , laughing nervously . "
42292	42305	42265	42265	I	0	" They wheeled their horses round , and cantered down the Row . "
42312	42316	42265	42265	I	0	" exclaimed Dodo . "
42430	42453	42428	42428	Vivy	141	" Dodo 's face suddenly grew grave and frightened . She reined her horse in opposite to where Mrs. Vivian was standing . "
42458	42462	42428	42428	Vivy	141	" she said , "
42469	42483	42484	42484	Dodo	79	" Mrs. Vivian looked up at Dodo with infinite compassion in her eyes . "
42488	42492	42428	42428	Vivy	141	" she said , "
42509	42542	42506	42507	Mr. Broxton	93	" Dodo got off , and Mrs. Vivian led her to a seat . Dodo had a sudden flash of remembrance of how she had sat here with Jack a year ago . "
42547	42552	42506	42507	Mr. Broxton	93	" she said again . "
42557	42571	42506	42507	Mr. Broxton	93	" said Mrs. Vivian , softly stroking the back of Dodo 's hand . "
42607	42691	42593	42594	The baby	283	" Dodo 's first feeling was one of passionate anger and resentment . She felt she had been duped and tricked in a most unjustifiable manner . Fate had led her to expect some happy days , and she had been cruelly disappointed . It was not fair ; she had been released from two tedious months of inactivity , only to be caught again . It was like a cat playing with a mouse . She wanted to revenge herself on something . "
42699	42703	42704	42704	Vivy	141	" she said . "
42715	42725	42726	42727	Poor Chesterford	144	" Then her better nature came to her aid . "
42734	42747	42726	42727	Poor Chesterford	144	" she said simply . Mrs. Vivian 's face grew more tender . "
42756	42760	42751	42751	you	79	" she said . "
42813	42814	42817	42817	I	0	" "
42825	42830	42821	42821	I	0	" said Dodo passionately ; "
42859	42860	42853	42853	I	0	" "
42865	42869	42870	42870	you	79	" she said , "
42931	42936	42937	42937	I	0	" Dodo sighed wearily . "
42943	42947	42939	42939	you	79	" she said ; "
42952	42978	42948	42948	I	0	" She turned and looked round on to the gay scene . The Row was full of riders , and bright with the flooding sunlight . "
42985	42989	42948	42948	I	0	" she said . "
43045	43072	43075	43075	Dodo	79	" Mrs. Vivian felt horribly helpless and baffled . How could she appeal to this woman , who looked at everything from only her own standpoint ? "
43077	43108	43075	43075	Dodo	79	" she said . They drove back in silence . Chesterford was standing in the hall as they entered , waiting for them . He came forward to meet Dodo . "
43115	43119	43109	43113	My poor , poor darling	994	" he said , "
43136	43292	43134	43134	Dodo	79	" Dodo turned from him passionately , and left him standing there . Dodo was sitting in the window of her morning - room late on the same afternoon . She and Lord Chesterford had been together to look at the baby as it lay there , with the little features that had been racked and distorted with pain , calm and set again , as if it only slept ; and Dodo had at that moment one real pang of grief . Her first impulse , as we have seen , was one of anger and impatience at the stupidity of destiny . She had been enjoying herself , in a purely animal way so intensely , at that moment when she saw Mrs. Vivian waiting for her under the trees . She was just released from a tedious period of inactivity , and inactivity was to Dodo worse than anything in the Inferno . "
43303	43312	43295	43295	I	0	" she had said once to Miss Grantham . "
43377	43389	43390	43391	the prisoner	999	" And so she had felt the sort of rapture with which "
43397	43950	43952	43954	a sensible man	1000	" when she had gone out that morning , and again knew the infinite delight of feeling a fine horse answer to her hand , under a sort of playful protest . Then this had come upon her , and Dodo felt that language , failed her to express her profound contempt and dislike for the destiny that shapes our ends . But her generosity and sense of fair play had come to her aid . She was not alone in this matter , and she quite realised that it was worse for Chesterford than herself . Chesterford had evinced the most intense interest in the baby in itself . Dodo , on the other hand , had frankly declared that the baby 's potentialities possessed a far greater attraction , for her than its actualities . But she had voluntarily linked her life with his ; and she must do her part — they had had a great loss , and he must not feel that he bore it alone . Dodo shook her head hopelessly over the unknown factor , that made her so much to him , and left him so little to her , but she accepted it as inevitable . Almost immediately after she had left him in the hall , she felt angry with herself for haying done so , just as she had been vexed at her reception of his proposal of family prayers , and a few minutes afterwards she sent for him , and they had gone together to see the baby . And then , because she was a woman , because she was human , because she was genuinely sorry for this honest true man who knelt beside her and sobbed as if his heart was broken , but with a natural instinct turned to her , and sorrowed more for her than for himself , her intense self - centredness for the time vanished , and with a true and womanly instinct she found her consolation in consoling him . Dodo felt as if she had lived years since this morning , and longed to cut the next week out of her life , to lose it altogether . She wanted to get away out of the whole course of events , to begin again without any past . From a purely worldly point of view she was intensely vexed at the baby 's death ; she had felt an immense pride in having provided an heir , and it was all no use ; it was over , it might as well never have been born . And , as the day wore on , she felt an overwhelming disgust of all the days that were to follow , the darkened house , the quieted movements , the enforced idleness . If only no one knew , Dodo felt that she would fling herself at once , this very minute , into the outside world again . What was the use of all this retirement ? It only made a bad job worse . Surely , when misfortune comes on one , it is best to forget it as soon as possible , and Dodo 's eminently practical way of forgetting anything was to absorb herself in something else . "
43958	43962	43963	43963	He	146	" she thought . "
43987	44095	43963	43963	He	146	" She felt an inward laughter , more than half hysterical , as to what would happen if she went and oiled Chesterford . She got up and went languidly across to the window . Lord Chesterford 's room was on the story below , and was built on a wing by itself , and a window looked out on her side of the house . Looking down she saw him kneeling at his table , with his face buried in his hands . Dodo was conscious of a lump rising in her throat , and she went back to her chair , and sat down again . "
44106	44110	44096	44096	He	146	" she thought , "
44133	44181	44182	44182	You	1002	" She walked downstairs to his study , and went in . He had heard her step , and stood near the door waiting to receive her . Dodo felt infinitely sorry for him . Chesterford drew her into a chair , and knelt down beside her . "
44197	44201	44189	44189	you	1002	" he said . "
44221	44227	44215	44215	I	0	" Dodo stroked his hand . "
44232	44236	44215	44215	I	0	" she said , "
44249	44250	44253	44255	my own wife	1007	" "
44257	44261	44253	44255	my own wife	1007	" he said , "
44307	44332	44303	44303	you	1002	" Dodo felt horribly uncomfortable . She had been aware before that there had been moments when , as Jack expressed it , she was "
44337	44344	44303	44303	you	1002	" but never to this extent . "
44352	44356	44350	44350	Chesterford	80	" she said . "
44367	44371	44350	44350	Chesterford	80	" he said , "
44444	44445	44436	44436	you	1002	" "
44452	44457	44436	44436	you	1002	" said Dodo softly . "
44468	44473	44465	44465	he	80	" said Lord Chesterford . "
44524	44525	44506	44506	she	96	" "
44528	44532	44506	44506	she	96	" said Dodo ; "
44556	44557	44547	44547	you	1002	" "
44563	44567	44561	44561	Dodo	79	" he said , "
44599	44600	44603	44603	dear	545	" "
44605	44609	44603	44603	dear	545	" said Dodo . "
44622	44623	44610	44610	I	0	" "
44635	44639	44633	44633	Dodo	79	" he said . "
44657	44662	44650	44650	you	79	" he added wistfully . "
44670	44674	44675	44675	you	79	" said Dodo ; "
44710	44711	44712	44712	You	79	" "
44717	44721	44722	44722	you	79	" he said ; "
44734	44735	44722	44722	you	79	" "
44746	44750	44739	44739	you	79	" said Dodo , "
44759	44782	44752	44752	I	0	" She felt the conversation was becoming much more bearable . Chesterford smiled . Dodo seized on it as a favourable omen . "
44792	44796	44797	44797	you	79	" she said ; "
44808	44815	44797	44797	you	79	" He looked at her earnestly . "
44975	45099	45100	45100	I	0	" That same evening Edith Staines and Miss Grantham were seated together in a box at the opera . The first act was just over , and Edith , who had mercilessly silenced every remark Miss Grantham had made during it , relaxed a little . Miss Grantham 's method of looking at an opera was to sit with her hack to the stage , so as to command a better view of the house , and talk continuously . But Edith would not stand that . She had before her a large quarto containing the full score , and she had a pencil in her hand with which she entered little corrections , and now and then she made comments to herself . "
45107	45111	45100	45100	I	0	" she murmured . "
45140	45157	45130	45130	he	1027	" But the act was over now , and she shut the book with a bang . "
45163	45167	45161	45161	Grantie	109	" she said , "
45230	45231	45234	45234	I	0	" "
45241	45246	45234	45234	I	0	" said Miss Grantham . "
45290	45291	45292	45292	I	0	" "
45298	45302	45292	45292	I	0	" said Edith . "
45311	45312	45292	45292	I	0	" "
45318	45323	45315	45316	Mr. Broxton	93	" remarked Miss Grantham . "
45363	45364	45354	45354	I	0	" "
45371	45376	45365	45365	I	0	" said Edith hotly . "
45446	45458	45459	45459	We	1031	" Jack meantime had made his way up to the box . "
45472	45478	45459	45459	We	1031	" remarked Miss Grantham sweetly . "
45487	45488	45482	45482	Dodo	79	" "
45494	45501	45491	45491	you	1034	" asked Jack . Edith frowned . "
45506	45510	45491	45491	you	1034	" she asked . "
45517	45532	45511	45512	Their baby	2445	" he said . Edith 's score fell to the ground with a crash . "
45540	45544	45511	45512	Their baby	2445	" she asked . "
45549	45550	45511	45512	Their baby	2445	" "
45559	45563	45551	45551	I	0	" said he , "
45594	45595	45585	45586	No one	2046	" "
45603	45608	45597	45597	you	1034	" said Edith severely . "
45616	45617	45611	45611	I	0	" "
45620	45625	45611	45611	I	0	" Edith frowned again . "
45632	45636	45628	45628	he	1034	" she asked . "
45642	45646	45637	45637	I	0	" he said ; "
45654	45661	45637	45637	I	0	" Edith picked up her score . "
45668	45672	45666	45666	Grantie	109	" she said . "
45684	45707	45680	45680	I	0	" Miss Grantham looked up in astonishment . Edith was folding her opera cloak round her . Jack offered to help her . "
45715	45720	45710	45710	I	0	" she said brusquely . "
45727	45735	45723	45723	you	0	" asked Miss Grantham , in surprise . "
45741	45745	45723	45723	you	0	" said Edith . "
45760	45767	45751	45751	someone	2235	" The door closed behind her . "
45775	45780	45751	45751	someone	2235	" remarked Miss Grantham , "
45893	45894	45890	45891	Poor Dodo	79	" "
45902	45906	45907	45907	you	0	" said Jack ; "
45918	45919	45920	45920	Dodo	79	" "
45926	45931	45920	45920	Dodo	79	" said Miss Grantham . "
46005	46006	46007	46007	I	0	" "
46016	46020	46007	46007	I	0	" said Jack . "
46032	46040	46041	46041	You	0	" Miss Grantham looked at him inquiringly . "
46049	46053	46043	46043	Dodo	79	" said Jack . "
46084	46100	46074	46074	She	79	" Miss Grantham was casting a roving London eye over the occupants of the stalls . "
46113	46117	46105	46106	Mr. Spencer	154	" she said . "
46163	46164	46158	46158	Maud	81	" "
46177	46181	46182	46182	She	81	" said Jack . "
46207	46208	46199	46199	Dodo	79	" "
46217	46222	46215	46215	Dodo	79	" murmured Miss Grantham ; "
46266	46267	46292	46294	Dear Prince Waldenech	155	" "
46271	46284	46292	46294	Dear Prince Waldenech	155	" , murmured Mrs. Vane , as she rustled into the box . "
46348	46360	46342	46342	Cupid	156	" she whispered , with a rich elaborateness to Miss Grantham . "
46387	46625	46384	46385	Mr. Spencer	154	" Mr. Spencer bowed and smiled , and conducted himself as he should . He was a fashionable rector in a rich parish , who had long felt that the rich deserved as much looking after as the poor , and had been struck with Maud 's zeal for the latter , and thought it would fit in very well with his zeal for the former , had won Maud 's heart , and now appeared as the happy accepted lover . Mrs. Vane was anxious to behave in the way it was expected that she should , and , finding that Miss Grantham sat with her back to the stage and talked , took up a corresponding attitude herself . Miss Grantham quickly decided that she did not know about the death of Dodo 's baby , and determined not to tell her . In the first place , it was to be supposed that she did not know either , and in the second , she was amused by the present company , and knew that to mention it was to break up the party . Mr. Spencer had a little copy of the words , with the English on one side and the Italian on the other . When he came to a passage that he thought indelicate , he turned his attention to the Italian . Maud sat between him and Miss Grantham . "
46633	46639	46631	46631	Maud	81	" Miss Grantham was saying , "
46664	46665	46649	46649	She	79	" "
46674	46679	46680	46680	Algy	158	" said Maud confusedly . "
46718	46724	46728	46728	you	158	" Miss Grantham smiled sympathetically . "
46730	46734	46728	46728	you	158	" she said ; "
46778	46779	46765	46766	Mrs. Vivian	96	" "
46794	46802	46782	46782	she	96	" said Maud , in a sort of rapture—"you
46839	46849	46827	46827	I	0	" Miss Grantham turned her attention to the stage . "
46857	46861	46827	46827	I	0	" she remarked . "
46883	46924	46880	46880	she	1060	" At that moment the door of the box opened , and Edith entered . She grasped the situation at once , and felt furiously angry with Miss Grantham and Jack . She determined to put a stop to it . "
46990	46997	47002	47002	Dodo	79	" Mrs. Vane started up distractedly . "
47004	47008	47002	47002	Dodo	79	" she cried , "
47041	47062	47039	47039	Dodo	79	" She began crying in a helpless sort of way . Maud turned round with a face full of horror . "
47077	47087	47071	47071	mother	1065	" Mr. Spencer dropped his English and Italian version . "
47096	47100	47089	47089	me	0	" he said . "
47111	47127	47108	47109	Mrs. Vane	90	" Maud turned to Jack , and for once showed some of Dodo 's spirit . "
47131	47135	47108	47109	Mrs. Vane	90	" she said , "
47185	47213	47182	47182	I	0	" she broke off , and followed the others . Jack felt horribly uncomfortable . He and Edith and Miss Grantham stood in silence for a moment . "
47222	47226	47218	47218	you	93	" said Edith , "
47240	47241	47242	47242	My	0	" "
47252	47264	47246	47246	I	0	" said Miss Grantham , in an even , calm voice . "
47308	47309	47305	47305	you	93	" "
47318	47322	47315	47316	Mrs. Vivian	96	" said Edith . "
47350	47454	47340	47340	she	96	" She handed him a note . Then she picked up her big score , and sat down again with her pencil . The note contained only two lines , requesting Mr. Broxton to come and see her in the morning . Jack read it and tore it up . He felt undecided how to act . Edith was buried in her score , and gave no sign . Miss Grantham had resumed her place , and was gazing languidly , at the box opposite . He picked up his hat , and turned to leave . Edith looked up from her score . "
47463	47467	47455	47455	I	0	" she said , "
47494	47531	47484	47484	I	0	" Jack opened his eyes in astonishment . Edith had always struck him as being rather queer ; and this statement seemed to him very queer indeed . Her manner was not conciliatory . He bowed . "
47543	47577	47532	47532	I	0	" he replied with well - bred insolence , and closed the door behind him . Miss Grantham laughed . A scene like this pleased her ; it struck her as pure comedy . "
47614	47615	47602	47602	you	104	" "
47623	47627	47616	47616	You	104	" said Edith . "
47903	47904	47896	47897	Mrs. Vivian	96	" "
47916	47922	47896	47897	Mrs. Vivian	96	" said Miss Grantham reflectively ; "
47953	47954	47946	47951	a great friend of Chesterford 's	1085	" "
47967	47971	47972	47972	His	78	" said Edith . "
48018	48019	48002	48002	he	78	" "
48027	48032	48002	48002	he	78	" murmured Miss Grantham . "
48042	48046	48040	48040	Chesterford	80	" said Edith . "
48178	48192	48170	48170	Faust	159	" She shut her book , and picked up her fan and gloves . "
48196	48202	48193	48194	Dear Edith	124	" said Miss Grantham languidly , "
48231	48421	48224	48224	I	0	" Jack meantime was finding his way home in a rebellious and unchristian frame of mind . In the first place , he had just lost his temper , which always seemed to him to be a most misdirected effort of energy ; in the second place , he resented Edith 's interference with all his heart and soul ; and in the third , he did not feel so certain that she was wrong . Of course he guessed what Mrs. Vivian 's wish to see him meant , for it had occurred to him very vividly what consequences the death of the baby would have on him and Dodo : and he anticipated another period like that which had followed the birth . Jack could hardly dare to trust himself to think of that time . He knew it had been very pleasant to him , and that he had enjoyed Dodo 's undisturbed company during many days in succession , but it was with a certain tingling of the ears that he thought of the events of the morning , and his mad confession to her . "
48430	48436	48422	48422	I	0	" thought Jack to himself . "
48493	48973	48488	48488	Dodo	79	" But he was quite sure of one thing — he would not go and see Mrs. Vivian . He was , he felt , possessed of all the facts of the case , and he was competent to form a judgment on them — at any rate Mrs. Vivian was not competent to do it for him . No , he would give it another chance . He would again reason out the pros and cons of the case , he would be quite honest , and he would act accordingly . That he should arrive at the same conclusion was inevitable . The one thing in the world that no man can account for , or allow for , is change in himself . If Jack had been able to foresee , when he went abroad , that he would be acting thus with regard to Dodo , he would have thought himself mad , and it would have been as impossible for him to act thus then , as it was inevitable for him to act thus now . If we judge by our own standards , and our own standards alter , we can not expect our verdicts to remain invariable . Under a strong attachment a man drifts , and he can not at any one moment allow for , or feel the force of the current , for he is moving in it , though he thinks himself at rest . The horrible necessities of cause and effect work in us , as well as around us . As Edith had said , his sense of security was his danger , for his standard of security was not the same as it had been . He sat down and wrote a note to Mrs. Vivian , saying that he regretted being unable to call on her to - morrow , and purposely forebore to give any reason . He had considerable faith in her power of reading between the lines , and the fact , baldly stated , was an unnecessary affront to her intellect . Mrs. Vivian read the note with very little surprise , but with a good deal of regret . She was genuinely sorry for him , but she had other means at her disposal , though they were not so pleasant to use . They involved a certain raking up of old dust - heaps , and a certain awakening of disagreeable memories . But it never occurred to her to draw back . Naturally enough she went to see Dodo next morning , and found her alone . Mrs. Vivian had her lesson by heart , and she was only waiting for Dodo to tell her to begin , so to speak . Dodo hailed her with warmth ; she had evidently found matters a little tedious . "
48977	48981	48488	48488	Dodo	79	" she said , "
49030	49031	49020	49020	I	0	" "
49036	49041	49034	49034	he	80	" asked Mrs. Vivian . "
49049	49053	49034	49034	he	80	" said Dodo , "
49107	49108	49101	49102	the Ethiopian	160	" "
49113	49123	49101	49102	the Ethiopian	160	" said she , with earnestness in her tone , "
49139	49140	49134	49134	you	79	" "
49148	49152	49145	49145	you	0	" said Dodo . "
49161	49166	49155	49155	I	0	" said Mrs. Vivian , "
49193	49194	49204	49204	You	0	" "
49199	49203	49204	49204	You	0	" said Dodo . "
49213	49214	49204	49204	You	0	" "
49218	49223	49216	49216	you	79	" said Mrs. Vivian . "
49267	49277	49252	49252	You	79	" Dodo rose from her chair with wide eyes . "
49282	49286	49280	49280	Vivy	141	" she said , "
49510	49517	49494	49494	I	0	" Mrs. Vivian looked up inquiringly . "
49528	49537	49520	49520	I	0	" said Dodo , speaking rapidly and excitedly ; "
49724	49725	49728	49728	Dodo	79	" "
49736	49741	49733	49733	I	0	" said Mrs. Vivian . "
49797	49798	49818	49818	I	0	" "
49806	49811	49818	49818	I	0	" said Dodo impatiently . "
49824	49837	49818	49818	I	0	" There was a long silence . Then Mrs. Vivian said , — "
50377	50451	50374	50374	your	1109	" Mrs. Vivian stood up . Her eyes were full of tears , and she laid her hands on Dodo 's shoulders . Dodo felt comfort in the presence of this strong woman , who had wrestled and conquered . Dodo looked affectionately at her , and , with one of those pretty motions that came so naturally to her , she pressed her back into her chair , and knelt beside her . "
50455	50459	50374	50374	your	1109	" she said , "
50500	50501	50492	50498	that man your husband was jealous of	1111	" "
50506	50512	50492	50498	that man your husband was jealous of	1111	" said Mrs. Vivian quickly ; "
50532	50536	50537	50537	You	141	" Dodo hesitated . "
50556	50575	50551	50551	Jack	78	" she suddenly said . Mrs. Vivian did not answer for a moment . Then she said , — "
50649	50650	50630	50630	he	78	" "
50663	50667	50652	50652	you	0	" demanded Dodo . "
50686	50695	50680	50680	I	0	" Mrs. Vivian went straight to the point : "
50708	50712	50701	50701	you	79	" she said . "
50720	50724	50701	50701	you	79	" Dodo smiled . "
50732	50736	50726	50726	I	0	" she said . "
50799	50800	50785	50785	He	78	" "
50812	50817	50807	50807	you	79	" said Mrs. Vivian . "
50830	50831	50818	50818	You	79	" "
50839	50856	50836	50836	I	0	" said Dodo , as if she was announcing the most commonplace fact in the world . "
50983	50984	50985	50985	Dodo	79	" "
50991	51002	50987	50987	you	79	" said Mrs. Vivian , laughing in spite of herself . "
51050	51051	51052	51052	I	0	" "
51059	51076	51052	51052	I	0	" said Dodo . So they went down together . Lord Chesterford was in his study . "
51089	51103	51104	51104	She	96	" remarked Dodo placidly , as she laid her hand on his shoulder . "
51120	51135	51117	51117	she	96	" Mrs. Vivian for the moment was nonplussed , but she recovered herself quickly . "
51144	51148	51149	51149	She	96	" she said . "
51155	51156	51149	51149	She	96	" "
51168	51177	51164	51164	you	79	" said he , capturing Dodo 's hand , "
51184	51185	51186	51186	I	0	" "
51192	51209	51186	51186	I	0	" murmured Mrs. Vivian , turning to go . Dodo 's hand lay unresistingly in his . "
51218	51226	51227	51227	she	96	" said Lord Chesterford to Mrs. Vivian , "
51233	51243	51227	51227	she	96	" Mrs. Vivian felt an immense admiration for him . "
51253	51264	51244	51244	I	0	" she said , putting out her hand to him . "
51277	51300	51301	51302	Mr. Broxton	93	" He retained Dodo 's hand , and they saw her to the door . The footman met them in the hall . "
51315	51321	51301	51302	Mr. Broxton	93	" he said to Dodo . "
51329	51334	51323	51323	you	0	" she asked Chesterford . "
51345	51349	51338	51338	you	0	" he said . "
51355	51365	51352	51352	I	0	" she answered . She turned to the footman . "
51398	51399	51394	51394	you	0	" "
51406	51427	51394	51394	you	0	" he said . Dodo and Chesterford turned back to the drawing - room . Jack was on the steps . "
51437	51444	51430	51430	you	0	" Mrs. Vivian said to him . "
51449	51453	51446	51446	I	0	" he answered . "
51463	51658	51454	51454	Dodo	79	" It was just three weeks after the baby 's death , and Dodo was sitting in her room about eleven o'clock in the morning , yawning dismally over a novel , but she was conscious of a certain relief , a sense of effort suspended . Late the evening before , Lord Chesterford had consulted her about some business down at Harchester , and Dodo , in a moment of inspiration , had said that it must be done by someone on the spot , that an agent was not to be trusted , and that if Chesterford liked she would go . This , of course , led to his offering to go himself , and would Dodo come with him ? Dodo had replied that she was quite willing to go , but that there was no need of both of them making a tiresome journey on an infernally hot day . Chesterford had felt , rather wistfully , that he would not mind the journey if Dodo was with him , but he had learned lately not to say such things . Dodo was apt to treat them as nonsense . "
51675	51918	51919	51919	Jack	78	" she would have said . The result was that Chesterford went , and Dodo was left alone ' in London , with a distinct sense of relief and relaxation . Dodo 's next move was to send a note to Jack , saying that he was going to come and lunch with her . She was not conscious of any sense of deception in this , but she had seen that Chesterford had not cared to see anybody since the baby 's death , except Mrs. Vivian , whereas she longed to be in the midst of people again . So , whenever opportunities occurred , she had been in the habit of seeing what she could of her friends , but was very careful not to bore her husband with them . She was quite alive to the truth of Mrs. Vivian 's remarks . But though Dodo felt a great relief in her husband 's absence , she was more than ever conscious of the unutterable stupidity of spending , day after day doing nothing . It was something even to keep it up with Chesterford , but now there was nothing to do — nothing . Still , Jack , was coming to lunch , and perhaps she might get through a few hours that way . Chesterford had said Be would be back that night late or next morning . The footman came in bearing a card . "
51922	51944	51919	51919	Jack	78	" thought Dodo , with wonder . But it was not Jack . Dodo looked at it and pondered a moment . "
51953	52032	51948	51948	I	0	" she said . A few moments afterwards Lady Bretton rustled into the room . Dodo had always thought her rather like a barmaid , and she was sure that she would attract many customers at any public - house . She was charmingly pretty , and always said the right thing . Dodo felt she ought to know why she had come , but could n't quite remember . But she was not left in doubt long . "
52036	52041	52034	52034	Dodo	79	" said Lady Bretton , "
52070	52077	52061	52061	Lucas	153	" Then it flashed upon Dodo . "
52124	52125	52119	52120	Lord Chesterford	80	" "
52128	52140	52119	52120	Lord Chesterford	80	" said Dodo , as if weighing something in her mind . "
52161	52162	52149	52149	I	0	" "
52170	52174	52164	52164	he	153	" asked she . "
52180	52181	52175	52175	I	0	" "
52207	52225	52175	52175	I	0	" Dodo paused . Then she got quickly up from her chair , and clapped her hands . "
52441	52442	52443	52443	I	0	" "
52447	52452	52443	52443	I	0	" said Lady Bretton . "
52535	52536	52515	52515	We	1133	" "
52541	52545	52515	52515	We	1133	" said Dodo ; "
52562	52587	52588	52588	We	1133	" Dodo snatched up an old cotillion hoop from where it stood in the corner with fifty other relics , and began practising it . "
52594	52598	52588	52588	We	1133	" she said ; "
52700	52713	52714	52714	I	0	" Dodo went through a series of mysterious revolutions with the hoop . "
52727	52737	52714	52714	I	0	" said Dodo , pausing to get her breath . "
52774	52803	52834	52834	Jack	78	" she said , with emphasis . Lady Bretton put her head a little on one side , and gushed at her . Her manners were always perfect . "
52814	52818	52806	52806	I	0	" said Dodo . "
52895	52937	52862	52862	You	1141	" Dodo felt herself again . There was the double relief of Chesterford 's absence , and there was something to do . She hummed a little French song , snapped her castanets , and pitched her novel into the grate . "
52945	52949	52950	52950	you	1141	" she said , "
52978	52988	52976	52976	Jack	78	" she went on , as the door opened . "
53026	53050	53023	53023	we	1144	" Jack had a very vague idea as to why he happened to be waltzing with Dodo . It seemed to him rather like "
53055	53113	53051	53053	Alice in Wonderland	165	" However , he supposed it was all right , and on they went . A collision with the table , and a slow Stygian stream of ink dropping in a fatal , relentless manner on to the carpet , caused a stoppage , and Dodo condescended to explain , which she did all in one sentence . "
53202	53233	53191	53191	I	0	" Dodo stopped from sheer exhaustion , and dropped a blotting - pad on to the pool of ink , which had now assumed the importance of an inland lake . "
53241	53245	53234	53234	Blanche	166	" she continued , "
53411	53412	53413	53413	I	0	" "
53419	53423	53415	53415	Chesterford	80	" said Jack . "
53434	53438	53426	53426	I	0	" remarked Dodo . "
53508	53509	53498	53498	I	0	" "
53521	53525	53510	53510	I	0	" said Jack ; "
53532	53533	53510	53510	I	0	" "
53540	53555	53510	53510	I	0	" remarked Dodo , in pure Lancashire dialect , helping herself largely to beefsteak . "
53604	53612	53599	53599	I	0	" said Dodo , upsetting the salt . "
53886	53913	53879	53879	I	0	" Dodo went on talking at the top of her voice , quite continuously . She asked Jack a dozen questions without waiting for the answer . "
53922	53942	53920	53920	Jack	78	" she continued , when they had finished coffee — Dodo took three cups and a cigarette with each . "
53989	54191	53920	53920	Jack	78	" Dodo dragged Jack off to the Zoo , on the top of a bus , and bought buns for the animals and fruit for the birds , and poked a fierce lion with the end of her parasol , which the brute bit off , and nearly fell over into the polar bear 's tank , and had all her money stolen by a pickpocket . Then she went back home , and found Lord Ledgers , whom she put through his paces , and then she had tea , and dressed for the ball . She had ordered a very remarkable ball - dress from Worth 's , just before the baby 's death , which had never yet seen the light . It was a soft grey texture , which Dodo said looked like a sunlit mist , and it was strictly half mourning . She felt it was a badge of her freedom , and put it on with a fresh burst of exultation . She had a large bouquet of orchids , which Lord Bretton had caused to be sent her , and a fan painted by Watteau , and a French hair - dresser came and "
54193	54282	54283	54283	You	1163	" her hair . By this time dinner was ready ; and after dinner she sat in her room smoking and singing French songs to Lord Ledgers , who had come to fetch her , and at half - past nine the carriage was announced . About the same moment another carriage drove up to the door , and as Dodo ran downstairs she found her husband in the hall . She looked at him a moment with undisguised astonishment , and a frown gathered on her forehead . "
54286	54290	54283	54283	You	1163	" she said . "
54300	54301	54293	54293	you	1163	" "
54308	54312	54302	54302	I	0	" he said ; "
54320	54321	54316	54316	you	0	" "
54331	54336	54337	54337	I	0	" said Dodo frankly ; "
54342	54350	54337	54337	I	0	" He turned round and faced her . "
54358	54362	54353	54353	Dodo	79	" he said . "
54370	54374	54375	54375	You	1163	" said Dodo . "
54415	54416	54409	54409	I	0	" "
54420	54425	54409	54409	I	0	" he said gently , "
54445	54451	54443	54443	Dodo	79	" Dodo 's face brightened . "
54470	54471	54462	54462	I	0	" "
54480	54491	54472	54472	I	0	" said he . Lord Ledgers was here heard to remark "
54495	54510	54493	54493	Gad	172	" Dodo laid her hand on his shoulder , conscious of restraining her impatience . "
54521	54525	54493	54493	Gad	172	" she said . "
54550	54551	54548	54548	you	129	" "
54565	54574	54554	54554	you	79	" he said again . Dodo grew impatient . "
54585	54589	54577	54577	you	129	" she said . "
54599	54618	54590	54590	I	0	" Lord Chesterford was not as meek as Moses . He was capable of a sense of injustice . "
54630	54634	54635	54635	you	79	" he said , "
54643	54644	54635	54635	you	79	" "
54648	54652	54635	54635	you	79	" said Dodo , "
54682	54718	54673	54673	I	0	" Lord Chesterford turned into his room . But he would not keep Dodo , as she wished to go , even if he could have done so . Ledgers was waiting in the carriage . "
54724	54796	54673	54673	I	0	" said Dodo , as she stepped in . Lady Bretton 's ball is still talked about , I believe , in certain circles , though it ought to have been consigned , with all other events of last year , to oblivion . It was very brilliant , and several princes shed the light of their presence on it . But , as Lord Ledgers was heard to remark afterwards , "
54809	55194	54807	54807	Dodo	79	" He felt as if he was adapting a quotation from the Koran , which was somehow suitable to the positive solemnity of the occasion . Dodo can only be described as having been indescribable . Lucas , Lady Bretton 's eldest son , in honour of whose coming of age the ball was given , can hardly allude to it even now . His emotions expressed themselves feebly in his dressing with even more care than usual , in hanging round Eaton Square , and in leaving cards on the Chesterfords as often as was decent . Dodo was conscious of a frenzied desire to make the most of it , and to drown remembrance , for in the background of her mind was another picture , that she did not care to look at . There was a man she knew , leaning over a small dead child . The door of the room was half open , and a woman , brilliantly dressed , was turning to go out , looking back over her shoulder with a smile , half of impatience , half of pity , at the kneeling figure in the room . Through the half - open door came sounds of music and rhythmical steps , and a blaze of light . This picture had started unbidden into Dodo 's mind , as she and Ledgers drove up to Lady Bretton 's door , with such sudden clearness that she half wondered whether she had ever actually seen it . It reminded her of one of Orchardson 's silent , well - appointed tragedies . In any case it gave her a rather unpleasant twinge , and she determined to shut it out for the rest of the evening , and , to do her justice , no one would have guessed that Dodo 's brilliance was due to anything but pure spontaneity , or that , even in the deepest shades of her inmost mind , there was any remembrance that it needed an effort to stifle . Many women , though few men , were surprised to see her there , and there was no one who was not glad ; but the question arose more than once in the minds of two or three people , "
55208	55513	55200	55200	she	1177	" Dodo had treated a select party of her friends to a private exhibition of skirt - dancing during supper - time . The music from the band was quite loud enough to be heard distinctly in a small , rather unfrequented sitting - out room , and there Dodo had displayed her incomparable grace of movement and limb to the highest advantage . Dodo danced that night with unusual perfection , and who has not felt the exquisite beauty of such motion ? Her figure , clad in its long , clinging folds of diaphanous , almost luminous texture , stood out like a radiant statue of dawn against the dark panelling of the room ; her graceful figure bending this way and that , her wonderful white arms now holding aside her long skirt , or clasped above her head ; above all , the supreme distinction and conscious modesty of every posture seemed , to the little circle who saw her , to be almost a new revelation of the perfection of form , colour and grace . Jack knew Dodo pretty well , but he stood and wondered . Was she a devil ? was she a tiger ? or was she , after all , a woman ? Dodo had told him what had happened that evening , and yet he did not condemn her utterly . He knew how prison - like her life must have been to her during the last month . It was a thousand pities that Dodo 's meat was Chesterford 's poison , but he no more blamed Dodo for eating her meat than he blamed Chesterford for avoiding his poison ; and to advance the conventional argument against Dodo , that her behaviour was not usual , was , equivalent to saying , "
55521	55525	55516	55516	you	1178	" rather than , "
55535	55776	55777	55778	The brute	2570	" Dodo 's estimate of herself , as purely normal , was only another instance of her very abnormalness . No , on the whole , she was not a devil . The other question was harder to settle . Jack remembered a tigress he had seen that day with her at the Zoo . The brute had a small and perfectly fascinating tiger cub , in which she took a certain maternal pride ; but when feeding - time came near , and the cub continued to be importunate , she gave it a cuff with her big velvety paw , and sent it staggering to the corner . Dodo 's tiger cub was a mixture between Chesterford and the dead child , and Dodo 's feeding - time had come round . Here she was feeding with an enviable appetite , and where was the cub ? The tigress element was not wholly absent . And yet , withal , she was a woman . Is it that certain attributes of pure womanliness run through the female of animals , or that every woman has a touch of the tigress about her ? Jack felt incompetent to decide . Dodo 's dance came to an end . She accepted Prince Waldenech 's arm , and went down to supper . As he advanced to her , Dodo dropped a curtsey , and he stooped and kissed her hand . "
55780	55873	55777	55778	The brute	2570	" thought Jack , as he strolled out into the ballroom , where people were beginning to collect again . Many turned and looked at Dodo as , she passed out with her handsome partner . The glow of exercise and excitement and success burned brightly in her cheeks , and no one accused Dodo of using rouge . The supper was spread on a number of small tables , laid for four or six each . The Prince led her to an empty one , and sat down by her side . "
55881	55902	55874	55874	I	0	" he said , in French , which permits a man to say more than he may I in English , "
55916	55941	55909	55909	I	0	" Dodo was far too accomplished a coquette to pretend not to know what he meant . She made him a charming little obeisance . "
55949	55953	55946	55947	your Highness	1181	" she said . "
55963	55964	55960	55960	you	0	" "
55973	55977	55965	55965	I	0	" said he . "
55991	56030	55986	55986	I	0	" Dodo felt suddenly a little uncomfortable . The forgotten picture flashed for a moment across her inward eye . She spoke of other things : praised the prettiness of the ballroom , the excellence of the band . "
56042	56047	56031	56032	Lady Bretton	152	" said the Prince , "
56055	56073	56053	56053	hers	152	" Dodo laughed . He was a little ponderous , and he deserved to be told so . "
56080	56084	56075	56075	Austrians	1183	" she said , "
56121	56122	56108	56108	they	1184	" "
56136	56137	56138	56139	No one	2046	" "
56149	56153	56154	56154	They	2046	" said Dodo . "
56169	56170	56171	56171	Austrians	163	" "
56176	56180	56183	56183	they	163	" said he ; "
56190	56191	56186	56186	they	163	" "
56194	56198	56186	56186	they	163	" said Dodo ; "
56375	56545	56359	56360	Some people	589	" The ball went on and on , and Dodo seemed to gather fresh strength and brilliance with each hour . Extra dances were added and still added , and many who were tired with dancing stayed and watched her . The princes went away , and nobody noticed their departure . If Cleopatra herself had suddenly entered the ballroom , she would have found herself at a discount . It was the culmination of Dodo 's successes . She seemed different in kind , as well as in degree , from the crowd around her . Pretty women seemed suddenly plain and middle - aged ; well - dressed women looked dowdy beside her , and when at length , as the electric light began to pale perceptibly before the breaking day , Dodo asked her partner to take her to Lady Bretton , the dancers stopped , and followed Dodo and Prince Waldenech , for she was dancing with him , to where Lady Bretton was standing . "
56551	56555	56359	56360	Some people	589	" said Dodo . "
56600	56780	56593	56593	he	153	" She took Prince Waldenech 's arm , and stood waiting with him , while her carriage detached itself from the others which lined the square , and drove up to the door . And , as they stood there , the crowd followed her slowly out of the ballroom , still silent , and still watching her , and lined the stairs , as she passed down to the front door . Then , when she had got into her carriage , and had driven off , they looked at each other as if they had all been walking in their sleep , and no one knew exactly why they were there . And a quarter of an hour later the rooms were completely empty . Meanwhile , as Dodo drove back through the still , cool , morning air , she threw down the windows of her carriage , and drew in deep satisfied breaths of its freshness . She thought of the crowds who had followed her down to the door , and laughed for pleasure . "
56789	56793	56794	56794	They	1192	" she thought . "
56807	56817	56794	56794	They	1192	" It was nearly six when she reached home ; "
56829	56833	56834	56834	I	0	" she thought . "
56858	56865	56851	56851	them	1192	" she said to the footman : "
56889	57204	56882	56882	I	0	" Chesterford did not let Dodo see how strongly he had felt on the subject of the ball . He argued to himself that it would do no good . Dodo would not understand , or , understanding , would misunderstand the strength of his feeling , and he did not care that she should know that he thought her heartless . He was quite conscious that matters were a little strained between them , though Dodo apparently was sublimely unaware , of it . She had a momentary nervousness when they met at breakfast , on the morning after the ball , that Chesterford was going to make a fuss , and she could not quite see what it would end in , if the subject was broached . But he came in looking as usual . He told her how matters had gone with him on the previous day , and had recounted , with a certain humour , a few sharp words which an old lady in his railway carriage had addressed to him , because he did n't help her to hand out two large cages of canaries which she was taking home . Dodo welcomed all this as a sign of grace , and was only too happy to meet her husband half - way . He had been a trifle melodramatic on the previous evening , but we are all liable to make mountains out of molehills at times , she thought . Personally her inclination was to make molehills out of mountains , but that was only a difference in temperament ; both implied a judgment at fault , and she was quite willing to forgive and forget . In a word , she was particularly nice to him , and when breakfast was over she took his arm , and led him away to her room . "
57216	57220	57213	57214	old boy	290	" she said , "
57343	57344	57345	57345	I	0	" "
57358	57362	57370	57370	I	0	" said Chesterford , "
57390	57391	57380	57380	I	0	" "
57397	57401	57380	57380	I	0	" remarked Dodo . "
57428	57440	57421	57421	He	0	" she went on , dramatically , addressing the black virgin , "
57467	57572	57465	57465	Chesterford	80	" . Dodo proceeded to write her notes , and threw them one by one at her husband as he sat contentedly by the window , in the very big chair that Dodo had indicated . Dodo 's correspondence was as varied as the collection of photographs on her mantelpiece . The first note was to her groom at Winston , telling him to have another riding - horse sent up at once , as her own particular mare had gone lame . It missed Chesterford 's head , and fell with an ominous clatter among some bric - à - brac and china . "
57585	57590	57583	57583	darling	357	" said Dodo sweetly . "
57604	57639	57594	57594	you	1208	" The next was a slightly better shot , and fell right side upwards on to Chesterford 's knee , but with the address upside down to him . He looked at it vaguely . "
57645	57653	57640	57640	His	1208	" he asked , spelling it out . "
57659	57663	57640	57640	His	1208	" said Dodo . "
57698	57705	57685	57685	He	155	" Chesterford was fingering the envelope . "
57712	57721	57706	57706	He	155	" he said , after a little consideration . "
57745	57746	57738	57738	you	1208	" "
57761	57772	57758	57758	you	545	" said she , conscious of bridling a rising irritation . "
57780	57784	57773	57773	He	155	" he repeated . "
57796	57811	57789	57789	Chesterford	80	" asked Dodo , impatiently tapping the floor with the toe of her shoe . "
57830	57831	57832	57832	You	79	" "
57851	57852	57834	57834	you	79	" "

57899	57923	57887	57887	you	79	" Dodo could lose her temper very quickly on occasions , especially when she was in a hurry , as she was now . "
57937	57938	57929	57929	you	79	" "
57945	57950	57941	57941	I	0	" she said vehemently . "
57985	57986	57987	57987	I	0	" "
57998	58004	58005	58005	You	0	" said Chesterford , rising . "
58013	58017	58005	58005	You	0	" remarked Dodo , "
58051	58052	58047	58047	I	0	" "
58062	58066	58047	58047	I	0	" he inquired . "
58071	58076	58047	58047	I	0	" said Dodo defiantly . "
58085	58089	58077	58077	I	0	" said he . "
58112	58120	58101	58101	I	0	" Dodo had lost her temper thoroughly . "
58129	58139	58140	58140	You	79	" she said , with scorn in her voice . "
58175	58176	58165	58165	I	0	" "
58190	58194	58179	58179	you	79	" said Chesterford . "
58197	58198	58179	58179	you	79	" "
58218	58222	58211	58211	you	79	" he asked . "
58228	58229	58211	58211	you	79	" "
58246	58250	58251	58251	Your	0	" he said . "
58261	58265	58251	58252	Your wife	428	" replied Dodo . "
58278	58289	58266	58266	I	0	" To do Chesterford justice he was getting angry too . "
58309	58313	58307	58307	Dodo	79	" he said . "
58326	58327	58328	58328	You	79	" "
58336	58337	58328	58328	You	79	" "
58345	58349	58328	58328	You	79	" said Dodo . "
58358	58369	58328	58328	You	79	" Dodo burst out into a harsh , mirthless laugh . "
58379	58383	58372	58372	you	0	" she said . "
58392	58398	58372	58372	you	0	" Chesterford coloured , angrily . "
58406	58410	58404	58404	Dodo	79	" he said . "
58434	58435	58429	58429	you	79	" "
58445	58449	58438	58438	I	0	" she remarked . "
58479	58480	58467	58467	I	0	" "
58488	58492	58467	58467	I	0	" said he . "
58506	58507	58508	58508	He	1233	" "
58514	58518	58519	58519	he	1233	" said Dodo ; "
58601	58602	58584	58584	I	0	" "
58615	58619	58603	58603	I	0	" said he . "
58632	58647	58653	58653	We	1236	" she replied . He was suddenly frightened . He came closer to her . "
58655	58656	58651	58651	Dodo	79	" "
58674	58678	58679	58679	I	0	" she said . "
58785	59070	59071	59071	Chesterford	80	" Dodo spoke with the recklessness of a woman 's anger , which is always much more unwanton than that of a man . A man does not say cruel things when he is angry , because they are cruel , but because he is angry . Dodo was cruel because she wished to be cruel . He gave her the note , and turned to leave the room . Dodo 's last speech made it impossible for him to say more . The only thing he would not sacrifice to his love was his honour or hers . But Dodo suddenly saw the horrible impossibility of the situation . She had not the smallest intention of living on bad terms with her husband . They had quarrelled , it was a pity , but it was over . A storm may only clear the air ; it is not always the precursor of bad weather . The air wanted clearing , and Dodo determined that it should not be the prelude of rain and wind . To her , of course , the knowledge that she did not love her husband had long been a commonplace , but to him the truth was coming in fierce , blinding flashes , and by their light he could see that a great flood had come down into his happy valley , carrying desolation before it , and between him and Dodo stretched a tawny waste of water . But Dodo had no intention of quarrelling with him , or maintaining a dignified reserve in their daily intercourse . That would be quite unbearable , and she wished there to be no misunderstanding on that point . "
59073	59077	59071	59071	Chesterford	80	" she said , "
59220	59314	59217	59218	C'est aimer	1244	" As she spoke she recovered her equanimity , and she smiled serenely on him . Scenes like this left no impression on her . The tragedy passed over her head ; and , though it was written in the lines of her husband 's face , she did not trouble to read it . She got up from her chair and went to him . He was standing with his hands clasped behind him near the door . She laid her hands on his shoulder , and gave him a little shake . "
59327	59331	59319	59319	I	0	" she said . "
59422	59465	59466	59466	Dodo	79	" Lord and Lady Chesterford were sitting at breakfast at Winston towards the end of September . He had an open letter in front of him propped up against his cup , and between mouthfuls of fried fish he glanced at it . "
59468	59472	59473	59473	Dodo	79	" No answer . "
59475	59533	59473	59473	Dodo	79	" rather louder . Dodo was also reading a letter , which covered two sheets and was closely written . It seemed to be interesting , for she had paused with a piece of fish on the end of her fork , and had then laid it down again . This time , however ; she heard . "
59538	59543	59544	59544	Jack	78	" she said abstractedly . "
59592	59593	59596	59596	I	0	" "
59603	59607	59596	59596	I	0	" said Chesterford . "
59629	59630	59623	59623	I	0	" "
59635	59644	59645	59646	The bailiff	1249	" said Dodo , relapsing into her letter . "
59664	59668	59645	59646	The bailiff	1249	" A pause . "
59678	59679	59673	59673	you	79	" "
59684	59688	59673	59673	you	79	" she said . "
59705	59706	59693	59693	Jack	78	" "
59712	59717	59707	59707	I	0	" said Chesterford brutally . "
59746	59747	59742	59742	he	520	" "
59755	59765	59750	59750	Chesterford	80	" said Dodo , dropping her letter in earnest . "
59801	59806	59798	59799	your grace	1256	" said Dodo reflectively . "
59813	59817	59818	59818	I	0	" said he . "
59855	59856	59859	59859	you	80	" "
59873	59877	59859	59859	you	80	" asked Dodo . "
59908	59909	59882	59882	I	0	" "
59916	59924	59925	59925	I	0	" asked Dodo , in real surprise . "
59932	59936	59925	59925	I	0	" said he ; "
59969	59970	59982	59982	you	80	" "
59976	59980	59982	59982	you	80	" exclaimed Dodo . "
59998	59999	59982	59982	you	80	" "
60012	60016	60010	60010	you	545	" said he . "
60032	60038	60040	60040	you	80	" Dodo felt intensely irritated . "
60045	60049	60040	60040	you	80	" she said . "
60088	60096	60082	60082	you	80	" Chesterford lost his patience a little . "
60103	60107	60082	60082	you	80	" he said , "
60197	60198	60179	60179	I	0	" "
60202	60206	60179	60179	I	0	" said Dodo , "
60228	60235	60224	60224	you	80	" Chesterford felt sick at heart . "
60240	60244	60224	60224	you	80	" he said , "
60254	60262	60247	60247	you	79	" He rose and stood by her . "
60319	60320	60324	60324	you	80	" "
60328	60342	60324	60324	you	80	" said Dodo , in a cool voice pouring out some more tea . "
60392	60413	60385	60385	I	0	" Dodo returned to her letter . Chesterford stood by her for a moment , and then left the room . "
60434	60445	60423	60423	I	0	" thought Dodo , with a fine sense of irresponsibility . "
60472	60637	60449	60449	he	1275	" Chesterford , meanwhile , was standing in the hall , feeling helpless and bewildered . This sort of thing was always happening now , do what he could ; and the intervals were not much better . Dodo treated him with a passive tolerance that was very hard to bear . Even her frank determination to keep on good terms with her husband had undergone considerable modification . She was silent and indifferent . Now and then when he came into her room he heard , as he passed down the passage , the sound of her piano or her voice , but when he entered Dodo would break off and ask him what he wanted . He half wished that he did not love her , but he found himself sickening and longing for Dodo to behave to him as she used . It would have been something to know that his presence was not positively distasteful to her . Dodo no longer "
60642	60837	60449	60449	he	1275	" as Jack said . She did not pat his hand , or call him a silly old dear , or pull his moustache , as once she did . He had once taken those little things as a sign of her love . He had found in them the pleasure that Dodo 's smallest action always had for him ; but now even they , the husk and shell of what had never existed , had gone from him , and he was left with that which was at once his greatest sorrow and his greatest joy , his own love for Dodo . And Dodo — God help him ! he had learned it well enough now — Dodo did not love him , and never had loved him . He wondered what the end would be — whether his love , too , would die . In that case he foresaw that they would very likely go on living together as fifty other people lived — being polite to each other , and gracefully tolerant of each other 's presence ; that nobody would know , and the world would say , "
60845	60865	60866	60866	I	0	" So he stood there , biting the ends of his long moustache . Then he said to himself , "
60882	60901	60876	60876	me	0	" He went back to the dining - room , and found Dodo as he had left her . "
60906	60910	60902	60902	Dodo	79	" he said , "
60926	60938	60918	60918	I	0	" Dodo was rather amused . She knew this would happen . "
60943	60947	60918	60918	I	0	" she said ; "
60962	61019	60955	60955	you	79	" Chesterford was disappointed and chilled . He turned on his heel and went out again . Dodo raised her eyebrows , shrugged her shoulders imperceptibly , and returned to her letter . If you had asked Dodo when this state of things began she could probably not have told you . She would have said , "
61046	61614	61040	61040	I	0	" But Chesterford , to whom daily intercourse had become an awful struggle between his passionate love for Dodo and his bitter disappointment at what he would certainly have partly attributed to his own stupidity and inadequacy , could have named the day and hour when he first realised how far he was apart from his wife . It was when he returned by the earlier train and met Dodo in the hall going to her dance ; that moment had thrown a dangerous clear light over the previous month . He argued to himself , with fatal correctness , that Dodo could not have stopped caring for him in a moment , and he was driven to the inevitable conclusion that she had been drifting away from him for a long time before that ; indeed , had she ever been near him ? But he was deeply grateful to those months when he had deceived himself , or she had deceived him , into believing that she cared for him . He knew well that they had been the happiest in his life , and though the subsequent disappointment was bitter , it had not embittered him . His love for Dodo had a sacredness for him that nothing could remove ; it was something separate from the rest of his life , that had stooped from heaven and entered into it , and lo ! it was glorified . That memory was his for ever , nothing could rob him of that . In August Dodo had left him . They had settled a series of visits in Scotland , after a fortnight at their own house , but after that Dodo had made arrangements apart from him . She had to go and see her mother , she had to go here and there , and half way through September , when Chesterford had returned to Harchester expecting her the same night , he found a postcard from her , saying she had to spend three days with someone else , and the three days lengthened into a week , and it was only yesterday that Dodo had come and people were arriving that very evening . There was only one conclusion to be drawn from all this , and not even he could help drawing it . Jack and Mr. Spencer and Maud , now Mrs. Spencer , arrived that evening . Maud had started a sort of small store of work , and the worsted and crochet went on with feverish rapidity . It had become a habit with her before her marriage , and the undeveloped possibilities , that no doubt lurked within it , had blossomed under her husband 's care . For there was a demand beyond the limits of supply for her woollen shawls and comforters . Mr. Spencer 's parish was already speckled with testimonies to his wife 's handiwork , and Maud 's dream of being some day useful to somebody was finding a glorious fulfilment . Dodo , I am sorry to say , found her sister more unsatisfactory than ever . Maud had a sort of confused idea that it helped the poor if she dressed untidily , and this was a ministry that came without effort . Dodo took her in hand as soon as she arrived , and made her presentable . "
61642	61646	61647	61647	Your	1280	" said she . "
61685	62086	62094	62094	I	0	" Dodo also did her duty by Mr. Spencer . She called him Algernon in the friendliest way , and gave him several lessons at billiards . This done , she turned to Jack . The three had been there several days , and Dodo was getting impatient . Jack and Chesterford went out shooting , and she was left to entertain the other two . Mr. Spencer 's reluctance to shoot was attributable not so much to his aversion to killing live animals , as his inability to slay . But when Dodo urged on him that he would soon learn , he claimed the higher motive . She was rather silent , for she was thinking about something important . Dodo was surprised at the eagerness with which she looked forward to Jack 's coming . Somehow , in a dim kind of way , she regarded him as the solution of her difficulties . She felt pretty certain Jack would do as he was asked , and she had made up her mind that when Jack went away she would go with him to see friends at other houses to which he was going . And Chesterford ? Dodo 's scheme did not seem to take in Chesterford . She had painted a charming little picture in her own mind as to where she should go , and whom she would see , but she certainly was aware that Chesterford did not seem to come in . It would spoil the composition , she thought , to introduce another figure . That would be a respite , anyhow . But after that , what then ? Dodo had found it bad enough coming back this September , and she could not contemplate renewing this tête - à - tête that went on for months . And by degrees another picture took its place — a dim one , for the details were not worked out — but in that picture there were only two figures . The days went on and Dodo could bear it no longer . One evening she went into the smoking - room after tea . Chesterford was writing letters , and Maud and her husband were sitting in the drawing - room . It may be presumed that Maud was doing crochet . Jack looked up with a smile as Dodo entered . "
62089	62093	62094	62094	I	0	" he said , "
62112	62119	62110	62110	Dodo	79	" But Dodo did not smile . "
62127	62136	62137	62137	You	1286	" continued Jack , looking at the fire . "
62148	62149	62150	62150	Jack	78	" "
62152	62157	62158	62158	you	78	" said Dodo solemnly , "
62176	62183	62168	62168	I	0	" Jack did not need explanations . "
62184	62189	62191	62191	Chesterford	80	Ah!"—then after a moment , "
62193	62194	62195	62195	I	0	" "
62205	62209	62202	62202	Chesterford	80	" said Dodo , "
62345	62363	62330	62330	I	0	" Dodo sat with her hands clasped before her , with something like tears in her eyes . "
62370	62375	62376	62376	I	0	" she went on ; "
62457	62463	62464	62464	I	0	" Jack felt intensely uncomfortable . "
62472	62476	62470	62470	Dodo	79	" he said . "
62498	62531	62494	62494	you	1290	" Dodo , for once in her life , seemed to have something to say , and not be able to say it . At last it came out with an effort . "
62540	62563	62535	62535	you	78	" Dodo did not look at him , but kept her eyes on the fire . Jack did not pause to think . "
62569	62574	62567	62567	Dodo	79	" , he said , "
62587	62588	62577	62577	I	0	" "
62597	62621	62595	62595	you	79	" This time he did pause . He got up and stood before the fire . Still Dodo did not look at him . "
62626	62630	62624	62624	Dodo	79	" he said , "
62647	62648	62642	62642	I	0	" "
62664	62668	62655	62655	you	79	" said Dodo . "
62717	62738	62705	62705	I	0	" Dodo paused ; but Jack said nothing ; it seemed to him as if Dodo had not quite finished . "
62741	62749	62705	62705	I	0	" she said ; then paused again . "
62756	62789	62752	62752	you	79	" There was a dead silence . For one moment time seemed to Jack to have stopped , and he could have believed that that moment lasted for years — for ever . "
62795	62799	62752	62752	you	79	" he murmured , "
62803	62863	62752	62752	you	79	" He was conscious of Dodo sitting there , with her eyes raised to his , and a smile on her lips . He felt himself bending forward towards her , and he thought she half rose in her chair to receive his embrace . But the next moment she put out her hand as if to stop him . "
62866	62870	62909	62909	You	0	" she said . "
62932	63151	62929	62929	you	0	" Dodo had taken the plunge . She had been wavering on the brink of this for days . It had struck her suddenly that afternoon that Jack was going away next day , and she was aware she could not contemplate the indefinite to - morrow and to - morrow without him . Like all Dodo 's actions it came suddenly . The forces in her which had been drawing her on to this had gathered strength and sureness imperceptibly , and this evening they had suddenly burst through the very flimsy dam that Dodo had erected between the things she might do , and the things she might not , and their possession was complete . In a way it was inevitable . Dodo felt that her life was impossible . Chesterford , with infinite yearning and hunger at his heart , perhaps felt it too . Jack felt as if he was waking out of some blissful dream to a return of his ordinary everyday life , which , unfortunately , had certain moral obligations attached to it . If Dodo 's speech had been shorter , the result might have been different . He steadied himself for a moment , for the room seemed to reel and swim , and then he answered her . "
63156	63161	63154	63154	Dodo	79	" he said hoarsely , "
63193	63213	63189	63189	you	80	" Dodo 's face grew hard and white . She tried to laugh , but could not manage it . "
63216	63220	63189	63189	you	80	" she said , "
63269	63270	63259	63259	you	80	" "
63276	63280	63274	63274	Dodo	79	" He said . "
63312	63333	63307	63307	Dodo	79	" The strain was too great for him . He knelt down beside her , and kissed her hand passionately . "
63341	63345	63334	63334	I	0	" he whispered , "
63517	63977	63511	63511	You	79	" There was a long silence , and in that silence the great drama of love and life ; and good and evil , which has been played every day of every year since the beginning of this world , and which will never cease till all mankind are saints or sexless , filled the stage . Dodo thought , at any rate , that she loved him , and that knowledge made her feel less abased before him . All love — the love for children , for parents , for husband , for wife , for lover , for mistress — has something divine about it , or else it is not love . The love Jack felt for her was divine enough not to seek its own , to sacrifice itself on the altar of duty and loyalty and the pure cold gods , and in its tumultuous happiness it could think of others . And Dodo 's love was touched , though ever so faintly , with the same divine spark , a something so human that it touched heaven . Now it had so happened that , exactly three minutes before this , Maud had found that she had left a particularly precious skein of wool in another room . About ten seconds ' reflection made her remember she had left it in the smoking - room , where she had sat with Dodo after lunch , who had smoked cigarettes , and lectured her on her appearance . The smoking - room had two doors , about eight yards apart , forming a little passage lighted with a skylight . The first of those doors was of wood , the second , which led into the smoking - room , of baize . The first door was opened in the ordinary manner , the second with a silent push . Maud had made this silent push at the moment when Jack was kneeling by Dodo 's side , kissing her hand . Maud was not versed in the wickedness of this present world , but she realised that this was a peculiar thing for Jack to do , and she let the door swing quietly back , and ran downstairs , intending to ask her husband 's advice . Chesterford 's study opened into the drawing - room . During the time that Maud had been upstairs he had gone in to fetch Dodo , and seeing she was not there he went back , but did not close the door behind him . A moment afterwards Maud rushed into the drawing - room from the hall , and carefully shutting the door behind her , lest anyone should hear , exclaimed : — "
64013	64393	64394	64395	Poor Dodo	79	" Algernon was suitably horrified . He remarked , with much reason , that it was no use telling Dodo and Jack , because they knew already . At this moment the door of Lord Chesterford 's study was closed quietly . He did not wish to hear any more just yet . But they neither of them noticed it . He had overheard something which was not meant for his ears , related by a person who had overseen what she was not meant to see ; he hated learning anything that was not his own affair , but he had learned it , and it turned out to be unpleasantly closely connected with him . His first impulse was to think that Jack had behaved in a treacherous and blackguardly manner , and this conclusion surprised him so much that he set to ponder over it . The more he thought of it , the more unlikely it appeared to him . Jack making love to his wife under cover of his own roof was too preposterous an idea to be entertained . He held a very high opinion of Jack , and it did not at all seem to fit in with this . Was there any other possibility ? It came upon him with a sense of sickening probability that there was . He remembered the long loveless months ; he remembered Dodo 's indifference to him , then her neglect , then her dislike . Had Jack been hideously tempted and not been able to resist ? Chesterford almost felt a friendly feeling for not being able to resist Dodo . What did all this imply ? How long had it been going on ? How did it begin ? Where would it stop ? He felt he had a right to ask these questions , and he meant to ask them of the proper person . But not yet . He would wait ; he would see what happened . He was afraid of judging both too harshly . Maud 's account might have been incorrect ; anyhow it was not meant for him . His thoughts wandered on dismally and vaguely . But the outcome was , that he said to himself , "
64401	64490	64399	64399	her	79	" He had been so long used to the altered state of things that this blow seemed to him only a natural sequence . But he had been used to feed his starved heart with promises that Dodo would care for him again ; that those months when they were first married were only the bud of a flower that would some day blossom . It was this feeble hope that what he had heard destroyed . If things had gone as far as that it was hopeless . "
64493	64497	64399	64399	her	79	" he repeated , "
64503	64534	64399	64399	her	79	" If anything could have killed his love for Dodo he felt that it would have been this . But , as he sat there , he said to himself , "
64545	64673	64535	64535	She	79	" That was his final determination . Dodo had wronged him cruelly ; his only revenge was to continue as if she had been a faithful wife , for she would not let him love her . Dodo should never know , she should not even suspect . He would go on behaving to her as before , as far as lay in his power . He would do his utmost to make her contented , to make her less sorry — yes , less sorry — she married him . Meanwhile Dodo and Jack were sitting before the fire in the smoking - room . He still retained Dodo 's hand , and it lay ; unresistingly in his . Dodo was the first to speak . "
64684	64688	64682	64682	Jack	78	" she said ; "
64897	65045	64893	64893	I	0	" Jack was really to be pitied more than Dodo . He knelt by her with her hand in his , feeling that he would have given his life without question to make her happy , but knowing that he had better give his life than do so . The struggle itself was over . He felt like a chain being pulled in opposite directions . He did not wrestle any longer ; the two forces , he thought , were simply fighting it out over his rigid body . He wondered vaguely whether something would break , and , if so , what ? But he did not dream for a moment of ever reconsidering his answer to Dodo . The question did not even present itself . So he knelt by her , still holding her hand , and waiting for her to speak again . "
65054	65059	65046	65046	You	1308	" Dodo went on . "
65128	65129	65155	65155	you	78	" "
65135	65139	65155	65155	you	78	" said Jack , "
65287	65288	65279	65279	Dodo	79	" "
65298	65302	65295	65295	I	0	" said Dodo . "
65371	65380	65354	65354	Mother	1065	" They were silent for a few minutes . "
65389	65393	65395	65395	I	0	" said Jack , "
65433	65442	65443	65445	Poor little ideal	1316	" He pressed her hand and she rose .. "
65447	65451	65443	65445	Poor little ideal	1316	" said Dodo . "
65497	65634	65494	65495	Poor dear	1318	" Dinner went off as usual . Dodo seemed to be in her ordinary , spirits . Chesterford discussed parochial help with Mrs. Vivian . He glanced at Dodo occasionally through the little grove of orchids that separated them , but Dodo did not seem to notice . She ate a remarkably good dinner , and talked nonsense to Mr. Spencer who sat next her , and showed him how to construct a sea - sick passenger out of an orange , and smoked two cigarettes after the servants had left the room . Maud alone was ill at ease . She glanced apprehensively at Jack , as if she expected him to begin kissing Dodo 's hand again , and , when he asked her casually where she had been since tea , she answered ; "
65648	65790	65494	65495	Poor dear	1318	" Jack merely raised his eyebrows , and remarked that he had been there himself , and did not remember seeing her . In the drawing - room again Dodo was in the best spirits . She gave Mr. Spencer lessons as to how to whistle on his fingers , and sang a French song in a brilliant and somewhat broad manner . The ladies soon retired , as there was a meet early on the following morning , and , after they had gone , Jack went up to the smoking - room , leaving Chesterford to finish a letter in his study . Shortly afterwards the latter heard the sound of wheels outside , and a footman entered to tell him the carriage was ready . Chesterford was writing when the man entered , and did not look up . "
65798	65802	65791	65791	I	0	" he said . "
65813	65818	65819	65819	She	1323	" said the man . "
65826	65846	65819	65819	She	1323	" Still Lord Chesterford did not look up , and sat silent so long that the man spoke again . "
65856	65860	65861	65861	I	0	" he asked . "
65876	65877	65878	65878	You	0	" "
65883	65887	65878	65878	You	0	" he said . "
65912	65913	65910	65910	her	1323	" "
65920	65939	65910	65910	her	1323	" He turned to leave the room , when Lord Chesterford stopped him again . He spoke slowly . "
65949	65950	65951	65951	She	100	" "
65992	65993	65977	65977	she	100	" "
65996	66001	65977	65977	she	100	" said Lord Chesterford . "
66015	66016	66011	66012	Mr. Broxton	93	" "
66028	66029	66011	66012	Mr. Broxton	93	" "
66051	66099	66011	66012	Mr. Broxton	93	" The man left the room , and gave his message . Jack wondered a little , but went down . Lord Chesterford was standing with his back to the fire . He looked up when Jack entered . He seemed to find some difficulty in speaking . "
66105	66111	66100	66100	Jack	78	" he said at last , "
66144	66150	66132	66132	you	78	" Jack advanced towards him . "
66158	66229	66230	66230	I	0	" he said simply , and held out his hand . He spoke without reflecting , for he did not know how much Chesterford knew . Of course , up to this moment , he had not been aware that he knew anything . But Chesterford 's tone convinced him . But a moment afterwards he saw that he had made a mistake , and he hastened to correct it . "
66235	66239	66230	66230	I	0	" he said , "
66264	66274	66257	66257	you	1337	" Lord Chesterford did not seem to be attending . "
66280	66321	66257	66257	you	1337	" he asked . Jack felt in a horrible mess . If he attempted to explain , it would necessitate letting Chesterford know the whole business . He chose between the two evils , for he would not betray Dodo . "
66328	66337	66257	66257	you	1337	" he said . Chesterford shook his hand . "
66346	66350	66344	66344	Jack	78	" he said . "
66373	66399	66403	66403	Dodo	79	" He paused , and Jack noticed that he was crumpling a piece of paper he held in his hand into a tight hard ball . "
66409	66424	66403	66403	Dodo	79	" Jack felt helpless and sick . He could not trust himself to speak . "
66430	66480	66481	66481	I	0	" asked Chesterford again . Jack for reply held out both his hands without speaking . There was something horrible in the sight of this strong man standing pale and trembling before him . In a moment Chesterford turned away , and stood warming his hands at the fire . "
66491	66495	66497	66497	I	0	" he said , "
66600	66606	66591	66591	I	0	" But Jack still lingered . "
66612	66616	66610	66610	Dodo	79	" he said ; "
66639	66640	66643	66643	her	79	" "
66645	66649	66643	66643	her	79	" asked Chesterford . "
66744	66829	66830	66830	Dodo	79	" Jack went out from his presence with a kind of awe . He did not care to know how Chesterford had found out , or how much . All other feelings were swallowed up in a vast pity for this poor man , whom no human aid could ever reach . The great fabric which his love had raised had been shattered hopelessly , and his love sat among its ruins and wept . It was all summed up in that short sentence , "
66836	66911	66830	66830	Dodo	79	" and Jack knew that it was true . The whole business was hopeless . Dodo had betrayed him , and he knew it . He could no longer find a cold comfort in the thought that some day , if the difficult places could be tided over , she might grow to love him again . That was past . And yet he had only one thought , and that was for Dodo . "
66920	67059	67060	67060	Dodo	79	" Truly there is something divine in those men we thought most human . Jack went to his room and thought it all over . He was horribly vexed with himself for having exculpated himself , but the point of Chesterford 's question was quite clear , and there was only one answer to it . Chesterford obviously did mean to ask whether he had been guilty of the great act of disloyalty which Dodo had proposed , and on the whole he would reconstruct the story in his mind more faithfully than if he had answered anything else , or had refused to answer . But Jack very much doubted whether Chesterford would reconstruct the story at all . The details had evidently no interest for him . All that mattered was expressed in that one sentence , "
67066	67080	67060	67060	Dodo	79	" Jack would have given his right hand to have been able to answer "
67083	67156	67060	67060	Dodo	79	" or to have been able to warn Dodo ; but he saw that there was nothing to be done . The smash had come , Chesterford had had a rude awakening . But his love was not dead , though it was stoned and beaten and outcast . With this in mind Jack took a sheet of paper from his writing - case , and wrote on it these words : — "
67171	67207	67060	67060	Dodo	79	" He addressed it to Dodo , and when he went downstairs the next morning he slipped it among the letters that were waiting for her . The footman told him she had gone hunting . "
67214	67218	67221	67221	sir	1343	" said Jack . "
67231	67347	67223	67223	he	1342	" replied the man . Dodo was called that morning at six , and she felt in very good spirits . There was something exhilarating in the thought of a good gallop again . There had been frost for a week before , and hunting had been stopped , but Dodo meant to make up all arrears . And , on the whole , her interview with Jack had consoled her , and it had given her quite a new feeling of duty . Dodo always liked new things , at any rate till the varnish had rubbed off , and she quite realised that Jack was making a sacrifice to the same forbidding goddess . "
67358	67365	67350	67350	I	0	" she thought as she dressed , "
67519	67567	67469	67469	Westley	184	" Dodo arranged her hat and stood contemplating her own figure at a cheval glass . It really did make a charming picture , and Dodo gave two little steps on one side , holding her skirt up in her left hand . she hummed to herself . "
67573	67615	67469	67469	Westley	184	" She ran downstairs and made tea , and began breakfast . A moment afterwards she heard steps in the hall , and Chesterford entered . Dodo was not conscious of the least embarrassment , and determined to do her duty . "
67621	67625	67469	67469	Westley	184	" she said , "
68005	68064	67995	67995	he	1357	" Chesterford laughed . Dodo had not behaved like this for months . What did it all mean ? But the events of the night before were too deeply branded on his memory to let him comfort himself very much . But anyhow it was charming to see Dodo like this again . And she shall never know . "
68078	68083	68084	68084	They	1358	" Dodo went on . "
68162	68323	68136	68136	you	290	" Dodo was surprised at the ease with which she could talk nonsense again . She abused herself for ever having let it drop . It really was much better than yawning and being bored . She had no idea how entertaining she was to herself . And Chesterford had lost his hang - dog look . He put her hat straight for her , and gave her a little kiss just as he used to . After all , things were not so bad . It was a perfect morning . They left the house about a quarter to seven , and the world was beginning to wake again . There was a slight hoar - frost on the blades of grass that lined the road , and on the sprigs of bare hawthorn . In the east the sky was red with the coming day . Dodo sniffed the cool morning air with a sense of great satisfaction . "
68332	68336	68325	68325	somebody	511	" she said , "
68437	68470	68428	68428	You	80	" None of Dodo 's worst enemies accused her of riding badly . She had a perfect seat , and that mysterious communication with her horse that seems nothing short of magical . "
68484	68490	68491	68491	he	1363	" she used to say , "
68568	68608	68609	68609	He	1363	" Dodo had a most enjoyable day 's hunting , and returned home well pleased with herself and everybody else . She found Jack 's note waiting for her . She read it thoughtfully , and said to herself , "
68635	68654	68627	68627	I	0	" She took up a pen , meaning to write to him , but laid it down again . "
68657	68661	68627	68627	I	0	" she said , "
68700	69000	69003	69003	God	99	" The days passed on . They went hunting every morning , and Dodo began to form very high hopes of her new child , as she called her ideal . The bad days did not seem to be the least imminent . Chesterford behaved almost like a lover again in the light of Dodo 's new smiles . He kept his bad times to himself . They came in the evening usually when the others had gone to bed . He used to sit up late by himself over his study fire , thinking hopelessly , of the day that had gone and the day that was to come . It was a constant struggle not to tell Dodo all he knew . He could scarcely believe that he had heard what Maud had said , or that he ever had had that interview with Jack . He could not reconcile these things with Dodo 's altered behaviour , and he gave it up . Dodo was tired of him , and he knew that he loved her more than ever . A more delicately - strung mind might almost have given way under the hourly struggle , but it is the fate of a healthy simple man to be capable of more continued suffering than one more highly developed . The latter breaks down , or he gets numbed with the pain ; but Chesterford went on living under the slow ache , and his suffering grew no less . But through it all he looked back with deep gratitude to the chance that had sent Dodo in his way . He did not grow bitter , and realised in the midst of his suffering how happy he had been . He had only one strong wish . "
69005	69009	69003	69003	God	99	" he cried , "
69028	69316	69019	69019	her	1367	" But there is a limit set to human misery , and the end had nearly come . It was about a fortnight after Jack had gone . Maud and Mr. Spencer had gone too , but Mrs. Vivian was with them still . Dodo had more than once thought of telling her what had happened , but she could not manage it . When Mrs. Vivian had spoken of going , Dodo entreated her to stop , for she had a great fear of being left alone with Chesterford . They had been out hunting , and Dodo had got home first . It was about three in the afternoon , and it had begun to snow . She had had lunch , and was sitting in the morning - room in a drowsy frame of mind . She was wondering whether Chesterford had returned , and whether he would come up and see her , and whether she was not too lazy to exert herself . She heard a carriage come slowly up the drive , and did not feel interested enough to look out of the window . She was sitting with her shoes off warming her feet at the fire , with a novel in her lap , which she was not reading , and a cigarette in her hand . She heard the opening and shutting of doors , and slow steps on the stairs . Then the door opened and Mrs. Vivian came in . Dodo had seen that look in her face once before , when she was riding in the Park with Jack , and a fearful certainty came upon her . She got up and turned towards her . "
69321	69334	69335	69335	I	0	" she asked . Mrs. Vivian drew her back into her seat . "
69341	69345	69335	69335	I	0	" she said . "
69432	69461	69463	69463	God	99	" Dodo sat perfectly still . She did not speak a word ; she scarcely even thought anything . Everything seemed to be a horrible blank to her . "
69468	69475	69463	69463	God	99	" she burst out at last . "
69505	69639	69640	69640	Paris	52	" She walked up and down the room , and then suddenly opened the door and went downstairs . She paced up and down the drawing - room , paused a moment , and went into his study . His papers were lying about in confusion on the table , but on the top was a guide - book to the Riviera . Dodo remembered his buying this at Mentone on their wedding - tour , and conscientiously walking about the town sight - seeing . She sat down in his chair and took it up . She remembered also that he had bought her that day a new volume of poems which had just come out , and had read to her out of it . There was in it a poem called "
69644	69671	69642	69642	Helen	190	" He had read that among others , and had said to her , as they were being rowed back to the yacht again that evening , "
69683	69724	69676	69676	I	0	" On the fly - leaf of the guide - book he had written it out , and , as she sat there now , Dodo read it . Dodo buried her face in her hands with a low cry . "
69732	69738	69739	69739	I	0	" she sobbed to herself . "
69782	69819	69779	69780	poor Chesterford	80	" She sat there sobbing in complete misery . She saw , as she had never seen before , the greatness of his love for her , and her wretched , miserable return for his gift . "
69831	69835	69825	69825	I	0	" she sobbed . "
69865	69882	69883	69883	You	0	" She was roused by a touch on her shoulder . Mrs. Vivian stood by her . "
69890	69894	69888	69888	Dodo	79	" she said . "
69901	69919	69920	69920	I	0	" Dodo did not answer her , but went upstairs . Before the bedroom door she stopped . "
69927	69931	69920	69920	I	0	" she said . "
69937	69938	69939	69939	They	1376	" "
69948	69953	69939	69939	They	1376	" said Mrs. Vivian ; "
69958	70008	69939	69939	They	1376	" Dodo stayed no longer , but went in . He was lying facing the door , and the shadow of death was on his face . But he recognised Dodo , and smiled and held out his hand . Dodo ran to the bedside and knelt by it . "
70013	70017	69939	69939	They	1376	" she sobbed , "
70038	70039	70032	70032	I	0	" "
70045	70049	70032	70032	I	0	" said he ; "
70056	70062	70050	70050	I	0	" Dodo raised her head . "
70068	70072	70063	70063	You	0	" she asked . "
70077	70081	70063	70063	You	0	" he said ; "
70091	70092	70087	70087	I	0	" "
70101	70105	70094	70094	you	0	" said Dodo . "
70111	70115	70116	70116	you	545	" said he ; "
70140	70141	70126	70126	you	545	" "
70150	70154	70126	70126	you	545	" she cried . "
70162	70163	70126	70126	you	545	" "
70172	70176	70126	70126	you	545	" he said . "
70219	70220	70196	70196	You	0	" "
70225	70230	70223	70223	Chesterford	80	" cried Dodo pleadingly . "
70235	70239	70223	70223	Chesterford	80	" he answered ; "
70275	70318	70343	70343	you	79	" Dodo could not answer him . She could only press his hand and kiss his lips , which were growing very white . It was becoming a fearful effort for him to speak . The words came slowly with long pauses . "
70325	70329	70330	70330	You	79	" he said . "
70348	70349	70343	70343	you	79	" "
70357	70362	70343	70343	you	79	" said Dodo brokenly ; "
70371	70372	70343	70343	you	79	" "
70376	70380	70381	70384	my sweet own wife	1386	" he said , "
70435	70447	70427	70429	my own darling	1387	" Dodo lay in his arms , and kissed him passionately . "
70454	70465	70427	70429	my own darling	1387	" she sobbed . He half raised himself in bed . "
70475	71336	70469	70469	Dodo	79	" he said . Then he fell back and lay very still . How long Dodo remained there she did not know . She remembered Mrs. Vivian coming in and raising her gently , and they left the darkened room together . Picture to yourself , or let me try to picture for you , a long , low , rambling house , covering a quite unnecessary area of ground , with many gables , tall , red - brick chimneys , unexpected corners , and little bow windows looking out from narrow turrets - a house that looks as if it had grown , rather than been designed and built . It began obviously with that little grey stone section , which seems to consist of small rooms with mullion windows , over which the ivy has asserted so supreme a dominion . The next occupant had been a man who knew how to make himself comfortable , but did not care in the least what sort of appearance his additions would wear to the world at large ; to him we may assign that uncompromising straight wing which projects to the right of the little core of grey stone . Then came a series of attempts to screen the puritanical ugliness of the offending block . Some one ran up two little turrets at one end , and a clock tower in the middle ; one side of it was made the main entrance of the house , and two red - tiled lines of building were built at right angles to it to form a three - sided quadrangle , and the carriage drive was brought up in a wide sweep to the door , and a sun - dial was planted down in the grass plot in the middle , in such a way that the sun could only peep at it for an hour or two every day , owing to the line of building which sheltered it on every side except the north . So the old house went on growing , and got more incongruous and more delightful with every addition . The garden has had to take care of itself under such circumstances , and if the house has been pushing it back in one place , it has wormed itself in at another , and queer little lawns with flower beds of old - fashioned , sweet - smelling plants have crept in where you least expect them . This particular garden has always seemed to me the ideal of what a garden should be . It is made to sit in , to smoke in , to think in , to do nothing in . A wavy , irregular lawn forbids the possibility of tennis , or any game that implies exertion or skill , and it is the home of sweet smells , bright colour , and chuckling birds . There are long borders of mignonette , wallflowers and hollyhocks , and many old - fashioned flowers , which are going the way of all old fashions . London pride , with its delicate spirals and star - like blossoms , and the red drooping velvet of love - lies - a - bleeding . The thump of tennis balls , the flying horrors of ring - goal , even the clash of croquet is tabooed in this sacred spot . Down below , indeed , beyond that thick privet hedge , you may find , if you wish , a smooth , well - kept piece of grass , where , even now — if we may judge from white figures that cross the little square , where a swinging iron gate seems to remonstrate hastily and ill - temperedly with those who leave these reflective shades for the glare and publicity of tennis — a game seems to be in progress . If you had exploring tendencies in your nature , and had happened to find yourself , on the afternoon of which I propose to speak , in this delightful garden , you would sooner or later have wandered into a low - lying grassy basin , shut in on three sides by banks of bushy rose - trees . The faint , delicate smell of their pale fragrance would have led you there , or , perhaps , the light trickling of a fountain , now nearly summer dry . Perhaps the exploring tendency would account for your discovery . There , lying back in a basket - chair , with a half - read letter in her hand , and an accusing tennis racquet by her side , you would have found Edith Staines . She had waited after lunch to get her letters , and going out , meaning to join the others , she had found something among them that interested her , and she was reading a certain letter through a second time when you broke in upon her . After a few minutes she folded it up , put it back in the envelope , and sat still , thinking . "
71345	71570	71338	71338	she	1391	" she said half aloud , and she took up her racquet and went down to the tennis courts . Ten days ago she had come down to stay with Miss Grantham , at the end of the London season . Miss Grantham 's father was a somewhat florid baronet of fifty years of age . He had six feet of height , a cheerful , high - coloured face , and a moustache , which he was just conscious had military suggestions about it — though he had never been in the army — which was beginning to grow grey . His wife had been a lovely woman , half Spanish by birth , with that peculiarly crisp pronunciation that English people so seldom possess , and which is almost as charming to hear as a child 's first conscious grasp of new words . She dressed remarkably well ; her reading chiefly consisted of the Morning Post , French novels , and small books of morbid poetry , which seemed to her very chic , and she was worldly to the tips of her delicate fingers . She had no accomplishments of any sort , except a great knowledge of foreign languages . She argued , with much reason , that you could get other people to do your accomplishments for you . "
71580	71584	71585	71585	I	0	" she said . "
71591	71600	71585	71585	I	0	" ( she never could quite manage the English "
71602	71604	71585	71585	I	0	" ) "
71633	71780	71781	71781	he	1394	" Edith had made great friends with her , and disagreed with her on every topic under the sun . Lady Grantham admired Edith 's vivacity , though her own line was serene elegance , and respected her success . Success was the one accomplishment that she really looked up to ( partly , perhaps , because she felt she had such a large measure of it herself ) , and no one could deny that Edith was successful . She had enough broadness of view to admire success in any line , and would have had a vague sense of satisfaction in accepting the arm of ; the best crossing - sweeper in London to take her in to dinner . She lived in a leonine atmosphere , and if you did not happen to meet a particular lion at her house , it was because "
71792	71843	71844	71844	You	1395	" ; at any rate , not because he had not been asked . Edith , however , felt thoroughly pleased with her quarters . She had hinted once that she had to go the day after to - morrow , but Nora Grantham had declined to argue the question . "
71854	71858	71844	71844	You	1395	" she said . "
71930	72004	71924	71924	you	1395	" Edith 's remark about the necessity of going had been dictated only by a sense of duty , in order to give her hosts an opportunity of getting rid of her if they wished , and she was quite content to stop . She strolled down across the lawn to the tennis courts in a thoughtful frame of mind , and met Miss Grantham , who was coming to look for her . "
72012	72016	72010	72010	Edith	104	" she said . "
72059	72060	72040	72040	She	193	" "
72063	72067	72061	72061	Grantie	109	" said Edith , "
72072	72073	72068	72068	Dodo	79	" "
72080	72085	72068	72068	Dodo	79	" said Miss Grantham . "
72158	72159	72180	72180	she	79	" "
72168	72172	72173	72173	Dodo	79	" said Edith . "
72194	72195	72189	72189	you	0	" "
72201	72206	72189	72189	you	0	" said Miss Grantham . "
72229	72230	72225	72225	Dodo	79	" "
72237	72241	72242	72242	Dodo	79	" said Edith . "
72258	72259	72242	72242	Dodo	79	" "
72267	72272	72265	72265	him	80	" murmured Miss Grantham . "
72286	72294	72284	72284	he	80	" Edith was still grave and doubtful . "
72304	72308	72284	72284	he	80	" she said . "
72333	72334	72324	72324	they	1408	" "
72340	72345	72324	72324	they	1408	" said Miss Grantham . "
72378	72379	72370	72370	She	79	" "
72393	72397	72398	72398	I	0	" said Edith . "
72415	72492	72406	72406	Jack	78	" she added inconsequently . Edith 's coming was the signal for serious play to begin . She entirely declined to play except with people who considered it , for the time being , the most important thing in the world , and naturally she played well . A young man , of military appearance on a small scale , was sitting by Lady Grantham in the tent , and entertaining her with somewhat unfledged remarks . "
72505	72510	72503	72503	she	104	" he was saying . "
72524	72536	72503	72503	she	104	" Mr. Featherstone had a habit of finishing all his sentences with "
72539	72571	72503	72503	she	104	" He pronounced it to rhyme with heart . Lady Grantham was reading Loti 's book of pity and death . It answered the double purpose of being French and morbid . "
72581	72585	72575	72575	you	104	" continued Featherstone . "
72618	72619	72620	72620	I	0	" "
72626	72631	72620	72620	I	0	" said Lady Grantham . "
72642	72651	72620	72620	I	0	" and she held the book towards him . "
72662	72666	72667	72667	I	0	" remarked Featherstone . "
72706	72711	72714	72714	you	104	" Lady Grantham reflected . "
72717	72721	72714	72714	you	104	" she replied . "
72748	72753	72714	72714	you	104	" she added crisply . "
72761	72765	72766	72766	you	191	" he replied , "
72780	72839	72840	72840	Nora	192	" Lady Grantham was seized with a momentary desire to run her parasol through his body , provided it could be done languidly and without effort . Her daughter had come up , and sat down in a low chair by her . Featherstone was devoting the whole of his great mind to the end of his moustache . "
72842	72848	72840	72840	Nora	192	" she said , quietly , "
72872	72873	72865	72865	him	1415	" "
72877	72881	72874	72875	Dear mother	1416	" she replied , "
72896	72922	72888	72888	He	1415	" Lady Grantham got gently up from her chair , and thrust an exquisite little silver paper - knife between the leaves of her book . "
72939	72975	72925	72925	I	0	" she said to him , without looking at him . He followed her , dragging the chair after him . Halfway across the lawn they met a footman bringing tea down into the ground . "
72980	72992	72925	72925	I	0	" she said . Then she turned to her little man . "
73002	73011	72996	72996	I	0	" she said , with a sweet smile . "
73023	73051	72996	72996	I	0	" Featherstone was impenetrable . He lounged back , if so small a thing can be said to lounge , and sat down again by Miss Grantham . "
73059	73063	73052	73056	Fascinatin ' woman your mother	1418	" he said . "
73109	73220	73106	73106	you	1415	" Two or three other fresh arrivals made it possible for another set to be started , and Mr. Featherstone was induced to play , in spite of his protestations that he had quite given up tennis for polo . Lady Grantham finished her Loti , and moved back to the tea - table , where Edith was sitting , fanning herself with a cabbage leaf , and receiving homage on the score of her tennis - playing . Lady Grantham did not offer to give anybody any tea ; she supposed they would take it when they wanted it , but she wished someone would give her a cup . "
73233	73256	73226	73228	the little man	1421	" she asked Edith , indicating Mr. Featherstone , who was performing wild antics in the next court . Edith informed her . "
73263	73268	73226	73228	the little man	1421	" demanded Lady Grantham . "
73286	73290	73280	73280	he	1421	" replied Edith . "

73466	73476	73446	73450	a Roman Catholic priest there	1434	" Edith lay back in her chair and laughed . "
73504	73505	73496	73496	you	0	" "
73512	73517	73518	73518	I	0	" said Lady Grantham . "

73688	73692	73693	73693	he	1434	" cried Edith ; "

73715	73720	73707	73707	I	0	" continued Lady Grantham ; "

73805	73809	73799	73799	you	545	" said Edith . "
73820	73825	73799	73799	you	545	" said Lady Grantham ; "
73889	73890	73891	73891	He	1448	" "
73900	73905	73893	73893	you	545	" interpolated Miss Grantham , "
73922	74055	73915	73915	You	545	" Sir Robert Grantham had joined the party . He was a great hand at adapting his conversation to his audience , and making everyone conscious that they ought to feel quite at home . He recounted at some length a series of tennis matches which he had taken part in a few years ago . A strained elbow had spoiled his chances of winning , but the games were most exciting , and it was generally agreed at the time that the form of the players was quite first - class . He talked about Wagner and counterpoint to Edith . He asked his vicar abstruse questions on the evidence of the immortality of the soul after death ; he discussed agriculture and farming with tenants , to whom he always said "
74059	74062	74057	74057	ye	1449	" instead of "
74066	74342	74064	74064	you	1449	" in order that they might feel quite at their ease ; he lamented the want of physique in the English army to Mr. Featherstone , who was very short , and declared that the average height of Englishmen was only five feet four . As he said this he drew himself up , and made it quite obvious that he himself was six feet high , and broad in proportion . A few more cups of tea were drunk , and a few more sets played , and the party dispersed . Edith was the only guest in the house , and she and Frank , the Oxford son , stopped behind to play a game or two more before dinner . Lady Grantham and Nora strolled up through the garden towards the house , while Sir Robert remained on the ground , and mingled advice , criticism , and approbation to the tennis players ; Frank 's back - handed stroke , he thought , was not as good as it might be , and Edith could , certainly put half fifteen on to her game if judiciously coached . Neither of the players volleyed as well as himself , but volleying was his strong point , and they must not be discouraged . Frank 's attitude to his father was that of undisguised amusement ; but he found him very entertaining . They were all rather late for dinner , and Lady Grantham was waiting for them in the drawing - room . Frank and his father were down before Edith , and Lady Grantham was making remarks on their personal appearance . "
74351	74359	74343	74343	You	1450	" she was saying to her son , "
74396	74406	74382	74382	they	1431	" Frank 's attitude was one of serene indifference . "
74413	74417	74382	74382	they	1431	" he said ; "
74423	74464	74418	74418	I	0	" Edith was five minutes later . Lady Grantham remarked on the importance of being in time for dinner , and hoped they would n't all die from going to bed too soon afterwards . Frank apologised for his mother . "
74473	74477	74418	74418	I	0	" he said , "
74515	74522	74524	74524	Dodo	79	" That evening Miss Grantham and Edith "
74526	74548	74524	74524	Dodo	79	" as the latter called it , till the small hours . She produced Dodo 's letter , and read extracts . "

75173	75179	75170	75171	Darling Dodo	79	" said Grantie with feeling . "

75342	75347	75334	75334	she	79	" remarked Miss Grantham . "
75359	75363	75334	75334	she	79	" pursued Edith . "
75383	75384	75381	75381	her	79	" "
75393	75398	75381	75381	her	79	" said Miss Grantham ; "

75415	75419	75381	75381	her	79	" said Edith . "

75457	75484	75454	75454	me	0	" Perhaps the thought of Chesterford was in Edith 's mind as she sat down to the piano , for she played a piece of Mozart 's "
75487	75522	75454	75454	me	0	" which is the saddest music in the world . Miss Grantham shivered a little . The long wailing notes , struck some chord , within her , which disturbed her peace of mind . "

75550	75654	75538	75538	You	0	" Edith stood looking out of the window . The moon was up , and the great stars were wheeling in their courses through the infinite vault . A nightingale was singing loud in the trees , and the little mysterious noises of night stole about among the bushes . As Edith thought of Chesterford she remembered how the Greeks mistook the passionate song of the bird for the lament of the dead , and it did not seem strange to her . For love , sometimes goes hand - in - hand with death . She turned back into the room again . "
75659	75663	75655	75655	God	99	" she said , "
75669	75670	75655	75655	God	99	" "

75696	75726	75671	75671	I	0	" Edith went to the piano , and broke into a quick , rippling movement . Miss Grantham listened , and felt she ought to know what it was . "
75731	75740	75671	75671	I	0	" she said , when Edith had finished . "
75752	75756	75757	75757	I	0	" she said . "
75766	75881	75882	75884	that Miss Vane	208	" Dodo had written to Edith from Zermatt , where she was enjoying herself amazingly . Mrs. Vane was there , and Mr. and Mrs. Algernon Spencer , and Prince Waldenech and Jack . As there would have been some natural confusion in the hotel if Dodo had called herself Lady Chesterford , when Lord Chesterford was also there , she settled to be called Miss Vane . This tickled Prince Waldenech enormously ; it seemed to him a capital joke . Dodo was sitting in the verandah of the hotel one afternoon , drinking black coffee and smoking cigarettes . Half the hotel were scandalised at her , and usually referred to her as "
75885	76039	76040	76040	Everyone	363	" ; the other half adored her , and went [ on ] expeditions with her , and took minor parts in her theatricals , and generally played universal second fiddle . Dodo enjoyed this sort of life . There was in her an undeveloped germ of simplicity , that found pleasure in watching the slow - footed , cows driven home from the pastures , in sitting with Jack — regardless of her assumed name — in the crocus - studded meadows , or by the side of the swirling glacier - fed stream that makes the valley melodious . She argued , with great reason , that she had already shocked all the people that were going to be shocked , so much that it did n't matter what she did ; while the other contingent , who were not going to be shocked , were not going to be shocked . "
76049	76053	76055	76055	they	363	" she said , "
76081	76145	76066	76066	I	0	" Dodo had made great friends with the Prince 's half - sister , a Russian on her mother 's side , and she was reading her extracts out of her unwritten book of the Philosophy of Life , an interesting work , which varied considerably according to Dodo 's mood . Just now it suited Dodo to be in love with life . "
76159	76164	76146	76146	You	1481	" she was saying , "
76247	76256	76224	76224	you	1481	" The Princess stretched out a delicate arm . "

76479	76483	76486	76486	you	1481	" she asked . "
76494	76500	76486	76486	you	1481	" said Dodo , laughing . "

76724	76762	76763	76763	I	0	" A shade of something passed over Dodo 's face . It might have been regret , or stifled remembrance , or a sudden twinge of pain , and it lasted an appreciable fraction of a second . "
76774	76803	76769	76772	that kind of man	1495	" she said in a moment . The Princess was lying back in her chair , ' and did not notice a curious hardness in Dodo 's voice . "

76956	76968	76940	76940	He	296	" Dodo shifted her position and looked up at the Matterhorn . "

77005	77010	76997	76997	He	296	" continued the Princess . "
77062	77066	77039	77039	He	296	" Dodo laughed . "
77078	77082	77070	77070	you	1481	" she said . "
77095	77096	77097	77097	I	0	" "

77291	77307	77283	77283	He	80	" said Dodo . Princess Alexandrina of course knew that Miss Vane was a widow . "

77402	77407	77408	77408	I	0	" The Princess considered . "

77467	77468	77461	77461	you	0	" "
77482	77498	77461	77461	you	0	" said Dodo to Jack , who had lounged up to where they were sitting . "
77508	77513	77499	77499	Dodo	79	" said the Princess . "
77520	77521	77515	77515	she	79	" "
77531	77535	77536	77536	She	79	" said he . "

77552	77557	77536	77536	She	79	" said the Princess . "
77576	77580	77569	77569	you	0	" she said . "
77588	77592	77581	77581	I	0	" said Dodo . "
77667	77677	77658	77658	he	78	" she added , employing a figure grammatically known as "
77680	77681	77658	77658	he	78	" "
77688	77693	77682	77683	My husband	296	" said the Princess . "
77738	77739	77740	77740	Jack	78	" "
77758	77762	77763	77763	I	0	" demanded Dodo . "
77777	77786	77771	77775	a woman who wanted to	1531	" remarked Jack , meeting Dodo 's glance . "
77803	77808	77771	77775	a woman who wanted to	1531	" said the Princess , "
77832	77833	77825	77825	I	0	" "
77844	77848	77825	77825	I	0	" said Dodo . "

77877	77882	77864	77864	you	0	" continued the Princess , "
77906	77907	77893	77893	she	428	" "
77917	77921	77910	77910	Jack	78	" said Dodo . "
77930	77931	77922	77922	You	78	" "
77943	77948	77949	77949	I	0	" said the Princess . "

77976	77982	77971	77971	you	78	" said Dodo , solemnly . "
78033	78057	78008	78008	She	1542	" Jack and Dodo strolled up through the sweet - smelling meadows towards the Riffelberg . A cool breeze was streaming down from the "
78061	78302	78303	78303	Decidedly	211	" of the glacier , heavy with the clean smell of pine woods and summer flowers , and thick with a hundred mingling sounds . The cows were being driven homewards , and the faint sounds of bells were carried down to them from the green heights above . Now and then they passed a herd of goats , still nibbling anxiously at the wayside grass , followed by some small ragged shepherd , who brushed his long hair away from his eyes to get a better look at this dazzling , fair - skinned woman , who evidently belonged to quite another order of beings from his wrinkled , early - old mother . One of them held out to Dodo a wilted little bunch of flowers , crumpled with much handling , but she did not seem to notice him . After they had passed he tossed them away , and ran off after his straying flock . Southwards , high above them , stretched the long lines of snow spread out under the feet of the Matterhorn , which sat like some huge sphinx , unapproachable , remote . Just below lay the village , sleeping in the last rays of the sun , which shone warmly on the red , weathered planks . Light blue smoke curled slowly up from the shingled roofs , and streamed gently down the valley in a thin , transparent haze . "
78312	78316	78303	78303	Decidedly	211	" said Dodo . "
78361	78362	78351	78351	I	0	" "
78372	78376	78365	78365	you	0	" asked Jack . "
78447	78448	78449	78449	I	0	" "
78457	78461	78449	78449	I	0	" said he . "
78473	78477	78465	78465	you	0	" said Dodo , "
78494	78495	78496	78496	I	0	" "
78502	78506	78496	78496	I	0	" said Jack ; "
78525	78526	78527	78527	I	0	" "
78536	78540	78527	78527	I	0	" said Dodo . "
78603	78604	78594	78594	I	0	" "
78617	78621	78594	78594	I	0	" said Jack ; "
78641	78642	78594	78594	I	0	" "
78648	78653	78594	78594	I	0	" said Dodo quickly . "
78691	78692	78684	78684	I	0	" "
78701	78707	78684	78684	I	0	" said Jack with sympathy . "
78721	78725	78710	78710	I	0	" said Dodo , "
78771	78905	78908	78908	Algy	158	" Dodo whistled shrilly on her fingers to attract their attention . Mr. Spencer had been gathering flowers and putting them into a neat , little tin box , which he slung over his shoulders . He was dressed in a Norfolk jacket carefully buttoned round his waist , with knickerbockers and blue worsted stockings . He wore a small blue ribbon in his top button - hole , and a soft felt hat . He carried his flowers home in the evening , and always remembered to press them before he went to bed . He and Maud were sitting on a large grey rock by the wayside , reading the Psalms for the seventeenth evening of the month . Dodo surveyed her critically , and laid herself out to be agreeable . "
78910	78914	78908	78908	Algy	158	" she said , "
78994	78995	78992	78992	Maud	81	" "
79005	79009	78996	78996	We	1552	" said Maud . "
79017	79021	78996	78996	We	1552	" said Dodo . "
79076	79181	79069	79069	Jack	78	" Dodo was a good walker , and they were soon among the pines that climb up the long steep slope to the Eiffel . Their steps were silent on the carpet of needles , and they walked on , not talking much , but each intensely conscious of the presence of the other . At a corner high up on the slope they stopped , for the great range in front of them had risen above the hills on the other side of the valley , and all the snow was flushed with the sunset . Dodo laid her hand on Jack 's . "
79199	79203	79204	79204	I	0	" she said . "
79229	79234	79235	79235	I	0	" And Jack promised . "
79241	79246	79239	79239	Chesterford	80	" Dodo went on . "
79271	79282	79283	79283	you	78	" even Dodo found it hard to get on at this moment—"did
79306	79313	79298	79298	he	78	" Jack 's face was grave . "
79320	79324	79317	79317	he	78	" he said ; "
79358	79359	79345	79345	I	0	" "
79370	79374	79364	79364	I	0	" said Dodo . "
79393	79394	79385	79385	I	0	" "
79401	79406	79385	79385	I	0	" said he suddenly ; "
79415	79427	79428	79428	Dodo	79	" They were silent a moment . Then Jack said , — "
79486	79709	79468	79468	I	0	" They rose and went down to the hotel ; the sun had set , and it grew suddenly cold . The theatricals that night were a great success . Dodo was simply inimitable . Two maiden ladies left the hotel the next morning . Dodo 's marriage was announced in September . It was to be celebrated at the beginning of December , and was to be very grand indeed . Duchesses were expected to be nothing accounted of . She was still in Switzerland when it was made known , and events had developed themselves . The announcement came out in the following manner . She had taken her moonlight walk , but not with Prince Waldenech . She had mentioned to him incidentally that Jack was coming as well , and after dinner the Prince found he had important despatches waiting for him . Dodo was rather amused at the inadequacy of this statement , as no post had come in that morning . The thought that the Prince particularly wished to take a romantic walk with her was entertaining . Next morning , however , while Dodo was sitting in her room , looking out over the wide , green valley , her maid came in and asked if Prince Waldenech might have permission to speak to her . "
79713	79722	79723	79723	I	0	" said Dodo affably , as he entered . "
79751	79759	79748	79748	you	1555	" The Prince twisted his long moustaches . "
79766	79772	79778	79778	you	1555	" he declared with frankness ; "
79786	79787	79778	79778	you	1555	" "
79796	79800	79789	79789	you	1555	" asked Dodo . "
79804	79808	79789	79789	you	1555	" he returned . "
79843	79844	79845	79845	You	1555	" "
79850	79855	79845	79845	You	1555	" said Dodo surprisedly . "
79863	79887	79857	79857	you	1555	" he murmured , advancing to her . Dodo read his meaning at once , and determined to stop his saying anything more . "
79895	79899	79889	79889	I	0	" she said . "
79930	79931	79924	79924	I	0	" "
79937	79942	79924	79924	I	0	" murmured the Prince . "
79954	79960	79951	79951	your	1555	" said Dodo , laughing . "
79990	80003	79978	79978	me	0	" and she swept him a little curtsey . The Prince bowed . "
80014	80018	80009	80012	a very fortunate man	1561	" he said . "
80029	80036	80039	80039	he	1560	" Dodo felt annoyed with him . "
80048	80054	80039	80039	he	1560	" she thought to herself . "
80069	80073	80061	80061	you	0	" she said . "
80106	80107	80097	80097	You	0	" "
80116	80132	80108	80108	I	0	" said he , with mock solemnity . He put both hands together and bowed . "
80143	80147	80133	80133	I	0	" he said , "
80165	80187	80152	80153	the Marchioness	1566	" Dodo smiled benignantly . He really had got excellent manners . The scene was artistic , and it pleased her . "
80199	80203	80191	80191	you	0	" she said . "
80216	80220	80205	80205	you	0	" he asked . "
80225	80229	80205	80205	you	0	" said Dodo ; "
80249	80250	80238	80238	I	0	" "
80259	80266	80251	80251	I	0	" said he , smiling gravely . "
80284	80474	80475	80475	He	1567	" He bowed himself gracefully out of the room . He and Dodo had been discussing English proverbs the day before , and Dodo asserted broadly that they were all founded on universal truths . The Prince thought that pity was quite a promising gift . Dodo was a little uneasy after he had gone . She was always a trifle afraid of him , though , to do her justice , no one would have guessed it . He had acted the rejected lover in the theatricals of the week before , and his acting had been rather too good . The scene she had just gone through reminded her very forcibly of it . She had found that she could not get the play out of her head afterwards , and had had long waking dreams that night , in which the Prince appeared time after time , and her refusal got more faint as he pressed his suit . She felt that he was the stronger of the two , and such a scene as the last inspired her with a kind of self - distrust . "
80484	80612	80475	80475	He	1567	" Dodo said to herself . She was very glad he was going to stop , and had been surprised to feel how annoyed she was when he said he had come to wish good - bye . But she felt he had a certain power over her , and did not quite like it . She would take Jack out for a walk and make things even . Jack had no power over her , and she thought complacently how she could turn him round her little finger . Dear old Jack ! What a good time they were going to have . She went downstairs and met the Prince and Jack on the verandah . The former was murmuring congratulatory speeches , and Jack was saying "
80615	80629	80630	80632	an oily devil	1568	" at intervals . He had once said to Dodo that the Prince was "
80634	80649	80630	80632	an oily devil	1568	" which was putting it rather strongly . Dodo had stuck up for him . "
80657	80661	80653	80653	he	1568	" she said , "
80721	80735	80706	80706	he	1568	" Jack followed Dodo into the square , and sat down by her . "
80747	80751	80738	80738	you	0	" he asked . "
80759	80785	80754	80754	I	0	" said Dodo . The memory of the interview was still rather strong in her mind , and she felt not quite sure of herself . "
80789	80793	80754	80754	I	0	" said Jack ; "
80805	80806	80797	80797	you	0	" "
80820	80824	80817	80818	old boy	290	" she said . "
80840	80841	80835	80835	I	0	" "
80845	80857	80843	80843	yourself	0	" said Jack crossly , and got up to walk away . "
80864	80868	80843	80843	yourself	0	" said Dodo . "
80876	80877	80843	80843	yourself	0	" "
80884	80899	80878	80878	I	0	" said Jack contentedly . He liked being hauled over the coals by Dodo . "
80923	80924	80918	80918	he	1579	" "
80930	80934	80918	80918	he	1579	" said Jack . "
80937	80941	80942	80942	I	0	" said Dodo , "
80963	80964	80957	80957	I	0	" "
80968	80972	80965	80966	Nasty brute	1580	" said Jack . "
80981	80982	80975	80975	you	0	" "
80994	80998	80992	80992	Jack	78	" said she . "
81016	81017	81013	81014	Nasty brute	1580	" "
81034	81038	81021	81021	he	1579	" asked Jack . "
81046	81047	81021	81021	he	1579	" "
81058	81072	81021	81021	he	1579	" Dodo applied the toe of a muddy shoe to Jack 's calf . "
81082	81086	81075	81075	I	0	" she said . "
81103	81118	81097	81097	you	78	" Jack made a grab at her foot , and made his fingers dirty . "
81123	81127	81119	81119	Jack	78	" said Dodo ; "
81135	81136	81130	81132	two thousand people	1583	" "
81141	81146	81138	81138	them	1583	" said Jack recklessly . "
81177	81178	81164	81164	Dodo	79	" "
81182	81227	81164	81164	Dodo	79	" said Dodo . Jack opened his mouth and howled . An old gentleman , who was just folding his paper into a convenient form for reading , on a seat opposite , put on his spectacles and stared at them in blank amazement . "
81234	81239	81230	81230	you	79	" remarked Jack parenthetically , "
81246	81262	81243	81244	Lord Chesterford	80	" exclaimed Dodo , in a shrill , treble voice , to the old gentleman . "
81278	81279	81272	81272	I	0	" "
81284	81303	81272	81272	I	0	" said the old gentleman , in a tone of the deepest sarcasm , returning to his paper . "
81308	81348	81272	81272	I	0	" echoed Dodo pianissimo to Jack , who was laughing in a hopeless internal manner . Dodo led him speechless away , and they wandered off to the little , low wall that separates the street from the square . "
81357	81368	81369	81369	We	1585	" , said Jack , when he had recovered somewhat . "
81383	81384	81378	81378	you	1587	" "
81409	81410	81392	81392	I	0	" "
81417	81421	81413	81413	he	1586	" demanded Jack . "
81430	81434	81424	81424	he	1586	" said Dodo . "
81440	81441	81436	81436	you	1587	" "
81444	81448	81436	81436	you	1587	" she answered . "
81481	81482	81463	81463	we	1589	" "
81491	81495	81483	81489	A nasty , vicious , oily brute	1590	" observed Jack . "
81502	81506	81498	81498	you	78	" said she ; "
81542	81543	81530	81530	you	78	" "
81551	81555	81530	81530	you	78	" said Jack , "
81563	81591	81557	81557	I	0	" They strolled down the street towards the church , and Dodo insisted on buying several entirely useless brackets , with chamois horns stuck aimlessly about them . "
81599	81603	81607	81607	Jack	78	" she observed . "
81623	81645	81607	81607	Jack	78	" Dodo was dissatisfied with one of her brackets before they reached the hotel again , and presented it to Jack . "
81653	81657	81659	81659	you	0	" said he ; "
81668	81669	81662	81662	you	0	" "
81673	81677	81659	81659	you	0	" said Dodo ; "
81704	81710	81698	81698	you	78	" she observed with feeling . "
81719	81720	81698	81698	you	78	" "
81729	81736	81722	81722	you	78	" said Dodo , with finality ; "
81751	81766	81768	81768	you	0	" The verandah was empty , as lunch had begun ; so Jack said , "
81770	81807	81768	81768	you	0	" The news of their engagement soon got about the hotel , and caused a much more favourable view to be taken of Dodo 's behaviour to Jack , in the minds of the hostile camp . "
81821	81826	81812	81812	she	1591	" said the enemy , "
81864	81889	81854	81854	Her	1591	" Mrs. Vane gave quite a number of select little teas on the verandah to the penitent , and showed her teeth most graciously . "
81903	81908	81890	81891	Darling Dodo	79	" she would say , "
81939	81958	81931	81931	they	1596	"—The speeches seemed quite familiar still to her . Dodo regarded the sudden change in the minds of the "
81961	81966	81969	81969	I	0	" with much amusement . "

82012	82022	82023	82023	you	78	" she called out to him as he passed , "
82051	82061	82048	82048	I	0	" The Princess expressed her opinions on the engagement . "
82073	82077	82066	82066	you	78	" she said . "
82261	82369	82252	82252	You	79	" They were going to walk up to a sufficiently remote spot in the rising ground to the east of Zermatt , and find their lunch ready for them . The Prince had no sympathy with meat sandwiches and a little sherry out of a flask , and his sister had expressed her antipathy to fresh eggs ; so he had told the hotel - keeper that lunch would be wanted , and that there were to be no hard - boiled eggs and no sandwiches , and plenty of deck - chairs . The Princess firmly refused to walk as far , and ordered what she said "
82378	82433	82252	82252	You	79	" ; and asked Dodo to wait for her , as she knew she would n't be in time . She was one of those people who find it quite impossible to be punctual at whatever time she had an engagement . She was always twenty minutes late , but , as Dodo remarked , "
82454	82458	82447	82447	I	0	" she added , "
82464	82465	82447	82447	I	0	" "
82479	82485	82468	82468	you	1609	" said the Princess vaguely . "

83576	83608	83560	83561	the priests	1622	" said Dodo . The party were waiting for them when they came up . The Prince led Dodo to a place next him , and the Princess sat next Jack . "
83614	83618	83609	83609	I	0	" said Dodo ; "

83668	83673	83661	83661	you	0	" , said she . "

83725	83730	83723	83723	dear	545	" remarked the Princess . "
83756	83779	83780	83780	I	0	" Mrs. Vane was eating her chicken with great satisfaction . A picnic with a Prince was so much capital to her . "
83797	83801	83785	83785	we	1650	" she said , "
83828	83850	83816	83817	your Highness	1181	" The Prince remarked that picnics were not his invention , and that the credit for the weather was due elsewhere . "
83868	83877	83854	83854	you	545	" said Mrs. Vane , floundering a little . "
83891	83892	83886	83887	the Prince	2616	" "
83902	83906	83908	83908	his	1659	" said Dodo , "
83949	83957	83946	83946	His	1659	" she said , emptying her glass . "
83966	83971	83946	83946	His	1659	" murmured the Prince . "
83986	83987	83977	83982	a poor devil whom you pity	1661	" "
83996	84021	83989	83989	you	0	" asked Dodo saucily . She was determined not to be frightened of him any more . The Prince decided on a bold stroke . "
84028	84051	83989	83989	you	0	" he said below his breath . But he had found his match , for the time being , at any rate . "
84063	84155	84058	84059	's cousin	1662	" laughed Dodo . The conversation became more general . The Princess said the mountains were too high and large , and she did n't like them . Jack remarked that it was purely a matter of degree , and the Princess explained that it was exactly what she meant , they were so much bigger than she was . Mr. Spencer plunged violently into the conversation , and said that Mount Everest was twice as high as the Matterhorn , and you never saw the top . The Princess said , "
84158	84325	84058	84059	's cousin	1662	" and Jack asked how they knew how high it was , if the top was never seen , and Mr. Spencer explained vaguely that they did it with sextants . Maud said she thought he meant theodolites , and Dodo asked a bad riddle about sextons . On the whole the picnic went off as well as could be expected , and Dodo determined to have lunch out of doors every day for the rest of her natural life . After lunch Mr. Spencer and Maud wandered away to pick flowers , presumably . Mrs. Vane moved her chair into the shade , in such a position that she could command a view of the mountain , and fell asleep . Jack smoked a short black pipe , chiefly because the Prince offered him a cigar , and Dodo smoked cigarettes and ate cherries backwards , beginning with the stalk , and induced the Princess to do the same , receiving two seconds ' start . "
84334	84339	84058	84059	's cousin	1662	" Dodo explained . The "
84343	84386	84387	84387	He	1663	" old gentleman was sighted under a large white umbrella , moving slowly up the path a little below them , and Dodo insisted on inviting him to lunch , as it was certain that he had just left the table d'hôte . "
84395	84404	84387	84387	He	1663	" she said , as she came back . "
84430	84729	84423	84423	He	1663	" Edith had stayed on with the Granthams till nearly the end of August . She declined to have breakfast with the family , after she had been there about a week , because she said it spoiled her mornings , and used to breakfast by herself at seven or half - past , which gave her extra ' two hours at her music ; and Lady Grantham complained of being wakened in the middle of the night by funeral marches . So Edith promised to play with the soft pedal down , which she never did . At lunch Sir Robert used to make a point of asking her how she had got on , and described to her the admirable band in the Casino at Monte Carlo . He was always extremely genial to her , and , when she played to them in the evening , he would beat time with one hand . Now and then he even told her that she was not playing staccato enough , or that he heard it taken rather quicker at Bayreuth . Dodo had written to Edith saying that she was coming to stay with her in September , and that Edith must be at home by the second , because she would probably come that day or the third . Edith happened to mention this one night in the hearing of Lady Grantham , who had been firing off home - truths at her husband and son like a minute gun , in a low , scornful voice . This habit of hers was rather embarrassing at times . At dinner , for instance , that evening , when he had been airing his musical views to Edith as usual , she had suddenly said , — "
84755	84798	84799	84799	Edith	104	" Though Edith felt on fairly intimate terms with the family , there were occasions when she did n't quite know how to behave . She attempted to continue her conversation with the Baronet , but Lady Grantham would not allow it . "
84825	84826	84818	84818	You	104	" "
84840	84853	84833	84833	she	507	" remarked Frank , alluding to his mother in the third person . "
84896	84897	84893	84894	Poor dear	1318	" "
84906	84911	84912	84912	You	1672	" said Edith sometimes . "
84934	84935	84936	84937	Some people	589	" "
84943	84947	84939	84939	mother	1065	" continued Frank . "
84959	84990	84939	84939	mother	1065	" On this occasion , when Edith mentioned that Dodo was coming to stay with her , Lady Grantham sounded truce at once , and left her unnatural offspring alone . "
85006	85011	84993	84993	you	1672	" said she presently . "
85050	85051	85034	85034	they	1677	" "
85064	85068	85061	85062	Miss Staines	104	" remarked Frank . "

85142	85147	85140	85140	mother	1065	" said Miss Grantham , "

85165	85169	85157	85157	She	100	" said Frank . "
85177	85192	85175	85175	Frank	204	" remarked the Baronet , who was still rather sore after his recent drubbing . "
85201	85202	85203	85203	Bob	197	" "
85214	85219	85205	85205	you	197	" said Lady Grantham . "

85306	85316	85317	85317	Nora	192	" said Edith , when this skirmishing was over . "
85344	85345	85346	85346	Hurrah	213	" "
85348	85352	85346	85346	Hurrah	213	" said Frank , "

85422	85427	85418	85418	her	79	" said Lady Grantham . "

85458	85463	85455	85455	she	79	" remarked Miss Grantham . "

85488	85493	85482	85482	She	79	" replied Lady Grantham . "
85500	85504	85505	85505	She	79	" said Edith . "
85524	85525	85505	85505	She	79	" "
85532	85537	85505	85505	She	79	" said Miss Grantham . "
85558	85559	85560	85560	I	0	" "
85567	85592	85560	85560	I	0	" said Lady Grantham . The remark was characteristic . Lady Grantham returned to the subject of Dodo in the course of the evening . "
85601	85607	85595	85595	she	79	" she said to Edith . "
85613	85668	85610	85610	her	79	" All successful people , according to Lady Grantham , had a method . They found out by experience what rôle suited them best , and they played it assiduously . To do her justice , there was a good deal of truth in it with regard to the people among whom she moved . "
85683	85691	85692	85692	She	79	" said Edith , after some consideration . "
85810	85811	85788	85788	She	79	" "
85823	85828	85821	85821	Edith	104	" remarked Miss Grantham . "
85864	85865	85850	85850	Dodo	79	" "
85879	85883	85850	85850	Dodo	79	" observed Edith . "
85898	85904	85905	85905	I	0	" Lady Grantham got up . "
85911	85915	85905	85905	I	0	" she said . "
85952	85957	85942	85942	Nora	192	" Lady Grantham never said "
85961	85963	85942	85942	Nora	192	" or "
85967	85975	85976	85976	They	1702	" to the members of her family . "
85982	85986	85976	85976	They	1702	" she said , "
86018	86110	85942	85942	Nora	192	" Although , as I have mentioned before , Sir Robert was an adept at choosing his conversation to suit his audience , there was one subject on which he considered that he might talk to anyone , and in which the whole world must necessarily take an intelligent and eager interest . The Romans used to worship the bones and spirits of their ancestors , and Sir Robert , perhaps because he was undoubtedly of Roman imperial blood , kept up the same custom . Frank used irreverently to call it "
86114	86269	85942	85942	Nora	192	" To know how the Granthams were connected with the Campbells , and the Vere de Veres , and the Stanleys , and the Montmorencies , and fifty other bluest strains , seemed to Sir Robert to be an essential part of a liberal education . To try to be late for family prayers was hopeless . They were at no fixed hour , and were held as many times during the day as necessary . Sometimes they were cut down to a sentence or two ; suggested by the mention of some ducal name ; sometimes they involved a lengthy , pious orgie in front of the portraits . To - night Edith was distinctly to blame , for she deliberately asked the name of the artist who had painted the picture hanging over the door into the library . Sir Robert , according to custom , seemed rather bored by the subject . "
86274	86278	85942	85942	Nora	192	" he said ; "
86314	86315	86317	86317	he	1703	" "
86321	86349	86317	86317	he	1703	" This sotto voce from Frank , who was reading Badminton on Cover Shooting . Sir Robert drew his hand over his beautiful moustache once or twice . "
86513	86514	86489	86490	my grandfather	1712	" "
86521	86525	86489	86490	my grandfather	1712	" remarked Edith . "
86590	86591	86592	86596	A tall , handsome man	1717	" "
86598	86605	86592	86596	A tall , handsome man	1717	" remarked Frank to the fireplace . "
86619	86632	86633	86633	You	1713	" continued Sir Robert , who was doing himself a gross injustice . "
86706	86707	86708	86708	I	0	" "
86715	86719	86708	86708	I	0	" remarked Edith . "

86768	86773	86761	86761	I	0	" said Sir Robert , "
86870	86884	86885	86885	I	0	" Edith rose to go . Sir Robert lighted her candle for her . "
86898	86902	86885	86885	I	0	" he said . "
86925	86926	86927	86927	My	0	" "
86941	86945	86946	86946	I	0	" said Edith . "
86961	86970	86954	86954	she	191	" Frank had followed them into the hall . "
86978	86982	86976	86976	father	1693	" he asked . "
86999	87009	86991	86991	you	1693	" Edith left the Granthams two days after this , "
87016	87020	86991	86991	you	1693	" she explained , "
87048	87252	87037	87037	I	0	" Sir Robert was very gracious , and promised to send her a short memoir he was writing on the fortunes of the family . It was to be bound in white vellum , with their arms in gilt upon the outside . Edith , found no one at home but a few servants on board wages , who did not seem at all pleased to see her . She devoted her evening to what she called tidying , which consisted in emptying the contents of a quantity of drawers on to the floor of her room , and sitting down beside them . She turned them over with much energy for about half an hour , and then decided that she could throw nothing away , and told her maid to put them back again , and played her piano till bed - time . Lady Grantham and Nora followed in a few days , and Dodo was to come the same evening . They were sitting put in the garden after dinner , when the sound of wheels was heard , and Edith went round to the front door to welcome her . Dodo had not dined , so she went and "
87260	87368	87037	87037	I	0	" as she expressed it . Travelling produced no kind of fatigue in her ; and the noise , and shaking , and smuts , that prey on most of us in railway carriages always seemed to leave her untouched . Dodo was particularly glad to get to England . She had had rather a trying time of it towards the end , for Jack and the Prince got on extremely badly together , and , as they both wished to be with Dodo , collisions were frequent . She gave the story of her adventure to Edith with singular frankness as she ate her broken meats . "
87388	87392	87397	87397	he	78	" said Dodo . "
87536	87537	87529	87529	Jack	78	" "
87540	87544	87529	87529	Jack	78	" said Edith ; "

87849	87854	87843	87843	She	104	" remarked Lady Grantham . "

87884	87885	87863	87863	you	104	" "
87894	87899	87888	87888	Edith	104	" asked Miss Grantham . "

88311	88361	88362	88362	I	0	" There was a short silence , broken only by the whispering of the wind in the fir trees . Then on the stillness came a light , rippling laugh . Dodo got out of her chair , and plucked a couple of roses from a bush near her . "
88370	88374	88362	88362	I	0	" she said ; "
88437	88453	88454	88454	I	0	" Dodo fastened the roses in the front of her dress , and laughed again . "

88522	88591	88516	88516	I	0	" Dodo was getting serious again in spite of herself . Lady Grantham was watching her curiously , and without any feeling of disappointment . She did not wear spectacles , she was , at least , as tall as herself , and she dressed , if anything , rather better . She was still wearing half - mourning , but half - mourning suited Dodo very well . "
88603	88608	88516	88516	I	0	" Dodo went on , "
88699	89017	88694	88694	I	0	" Dodo was aware of more reasons for happiness than she mentioned . She was particularly conscious of the relief she felt in getting away from the Prince . For some days past she had been unpleasantly aware of his presence . She could not manage to think of him quite as lightly as she thought of anyone else . It was a continual effort to her to appear quite herself in his presence , and she was constantly rushing into extremes in order to seem at her ease . He was stronger , she felt , than she was , and she did not like it . The immense relief which his absence brought more than compensated for the slight blankness that his absence left . In a way she felt dependent on him , which chafed and irritated her , for she had never come under such a yoke before . She had had several moments of sudden anger against herself on her way home . She found herself always thinking about him when she was not thinking about anything else ; and though she was quite capable of sending her thoughts off to other subjects , when they had done their work they always fluttered back again to the same resting - place , and Dodo was conscious of an effort , slight indeed , but still an effort , in frightening them off . Her curious insistence on her own happiness had struck Edith . She felt it unnatural that Dodo should mention it , and she drew one of two conclusions from it ; either that Dodo had had a rather trying time , for some reason or other , or that she wished to convince herself , by constant repetition , of something that she was not quite sure about ; and both of these conclusions were in a measure correct . "
89028	89033	88694	88694	I	0	" inquired Miss Grantham . "
89062	89066	89057	89057	Jack	78	" said Dodo . "
89074	89078	89072	89072	himself	155	" she asked . "
89095	89099	89091	89091	I	0	" said Dodo . "
89109	89114	89107	89107	he	2616	" said Miss Grantham . "
89123	89124	89115	89115	I	0	" "
89129	89133	89115	89115	I	0	" said Dodo ; "
89149	89312	89115	89115	I	0	" Edith looked up suddenly at Dodo . There was an elaborate carelessness , she thought , in her voice . It was just a little overdone . The night was descending fast , and she could only just see the lines of her face above the misty folds of her grey dress . But even in that half light she thought that her careless voice did not quite seem a true interpretation of her expression . It might have been only the dimness of the shadow , but she thought she looked anxious and rather depressed . Lady Grantham drew her shawl more closely round her shoulders , and remarked that it was getting cold . Edith got up and prepared to go in , and Miss Grantham nestled in her chair . Only Dodo stood quite motionless , and Edith noticed that her hands were tearing one of the roses to pieces , and scattering the petals on the grass . "
89320	89324	89314	89314	you	1807	" she asked ; "
89335	89336	89327	89327	you	1807	" "
89347	89351	89337	89337	I	0	" said Dodo ; "
89396	89397	89388	89388	I	0	" "
89406	89411	89404	89404	Dodo	79	" said Miss Grantham . "
89445	89455	89422	89422	Edith	104	" Lady Grantham and Edith went towards the house . "
89468	89473	89460	89460	her	79	" said Lady Grantham . "
89504	89505	89499	89499	She	79	" "
89515	89519	89508	89508	Dodo	79	" said Edith . "
89539	89738	89528	89528	She	79	" The piano in the drawing - room was close to a large French window opening on to the lawn . Edith threw it open , and stood for a moment looking out into the darkness . She could just see Dodo and Nora sitting where they had left them , though they were no more than two pale spots against the dark background . She was conscious of a strange feeling that there was an undercurrent at work in Dodo , which showed itself by a few chance bubbles and little sudden eddies on the surface , which she thought required explanation . Dodo certainly was not quite like herself . There was no edge to her vivacity : her attempts not to be serious had been distinctly forced , and she was unable to keep it up . Edith felt a vague sense of coming disaster ; slight but certain . However , she drew her chair to the piano and began to play . Miss Grantham was conscious of the same sort of feeling . Since the others had gone in , Dodo had sat quite silent , and she had not taken her cigarette . "
89748	89754	89739	89739	You	1812	" she remarked at length . "
89759	89766	89739	89739	You	1812	" said Dodo , rousing herself . "
89832	89833	89829	89830	the Prince	2616	" "
89838	89843	89829	89830	the Prince	2616	" said Miss Grantham . "
89858	89862	89846	89846	you	1812	" asked Dodo . "
89870	89875	89865	89865	he	2616	" said Miss Grantham . "
89886	89887	89882	89882	he	2616	" "
89897	89907	89895	89895	you	1812	" asked Dodo , with the most careful carelessness . "
89919	89920	89908	89908	He	2616	" "
89948	89949	89933	89933	she	104	" "
89963	89969	89955	89955	I	0	" said Dodo , hastily . "
90007	90008	90004	90005	fifty acquaintances	1822	" "
90016	90021	90010	90010	you	1812	" asked Miss Grantham . "
90028	90032	90010	90010	you	1812	" she said , "
90074	90075	90070	90070	she	104	" "
90082	90087	90080	90080	Wagner	203	" said Miss Grantham . "
90092	90096	90088	90088	I	0	" said Dodo . "
90147	90148	90149	90149	You	0	" "
90159	90164	90149	90149	You	0	" said Miss Grantham . "
90174	90178	90171	90171	I	0	" she said . "
90196	90228	90229	90229	You	0	" Dodo went to bed soon afterwards . She said she was tired , and a little overdone . Edith looked at her rather closely as she said good - night . "
90237	90241	90229	90229	You	0	" she asked . "
90252	90253	90254	90254	I	0	" "
90263	90270	90254	90254	I	0	" said Dodo , rather wearily . "
90280	90322	90323	90323	Waldenech	155	" Dodo went upstairs and found that her maid had unpacked for her . A heap of books was lying on the table , and from among these she drew out a large envelope with a photograph inside . It was signed "
90325	91169	90323	90323	Waldenech	155	" Dodo looked at it a moment , then placed it back in its envelope , and went to the window . She felt the necessity of air . The room seemed close and hot , and she threw it wide open . She stood there for ten minutes or more quite still , looking out into the night . Then she went back to the table and took up the envelope again . With a sudden passionate gesture she tore it in half , then across again , and threw the pieces into the grate . Dodo slept long and dreamlessly that night ; the deep , dreamless sleep which an evenly - balanced fatigue of body and mind so often produces , though we get into bed feeling that our brain is too deep in some tangle of unsolved thought to be able to extricate itself , and fall into the dim immensity of sleep . The waking from such a sleep is not so pleasant . The first moment of conscious thought sometimes throws the whole burden again on to our brain with a sudden start of pain that is almost physical . There is no transition . We were asleep and we are awake , and we find that sleep has brought us only a doubtful gift , for with our renewed strength of body has come the capability of keener suffering . When we are tired , mental distress is only a dull ache , but in the hard , convincing morning it strikes a deadlier and deeper pain . But sometimes Nature is more merciful . She opens the sluices of our brain quietly , and , though the water still rushes in turbidly and roughly , yet the fact that our brain fills by degrees makes us more able to bear the full weight , than when it comes suddenly with a wrenching and , perhaps , a rending of our mental machinery . It was in this way that Dodo woke . The trouble of the day came to her gradually during the moments of waking . She dreamed she was waiting for Jack in the garden where she had been sitting the night before . It was perfectly dark , and she could not see him coming , but she heard a step along the gravel path , and started up with a vague alarm , for it did not sound like his . Then a greyness , as of dawn , began to steal over the night , and she saw the outline of the trees against the sky , and the outline of a man 's figure near her , and it was a figure she knew well , but it was not Jack . On this dream the sense of waking was pure relief ; it was broad day , and her maid was standing by her and saying that it was a quarter past nine . Dodo lay still a few moments longer , feeling a vague joy that her dream was not true , that the helplessness of that grey moment , when she saw that it was not Jack , was passed , that she was awake again , and unfettered , save by thoughts which could be consciously checked and stifled . It was with a vast sense of satisfaction that she remembered her last act on the evening before , of which the scattered fragments in the grate afforded ocular proof . She felt as if she had broken a visible , tangible fetter — one strand , at any rate , of the cord that hound her was lying broken before her eyes . If she had been quite securely tied she could not have done that .. — The sense of successful effort , with a visible result , gave her a sudden feeling of power to do more ; the absence of bodily fatigue , and the presence of superfluous physical health , all seemed part of a different order of things to that of the night before . She got up and dressed quickly , feeling more like her own self than she had done for several days . The destruction of his photograph was really a great achievement . She had no idea how far things had gone till she felt the full effect of conscious effort and its result . She could see now exactly where she had stood on the evening before , very unpleasantly close to the edge of a nasty place , slippery and steep . Anyhow , she was one step nearer that pleasant , green - looking spot at the top of the slope — a quiet , pretty place , not particularly extensive , but very pleasing , and very safe . The three others were half - way through breakfast when Dodo came down . Lady Grantham was feeling a little bored . Dodo flung open the door and came marching in , whistling "
91176	91177	91171	91173	the Conquering Hero	1825	" "
91188	91192	91181	91181	Handel	116	" she said . "
91372	91400	91360	91360	I	0	" Dodo went to the sideboard and cut a large slice of ham , which she carried back to her place on the end of her fork . "
91421	91425	91413	91413	you	104	" she said . "
91455	91488	91446	91446	I	0	" Dodo waved her fork triumphantly , and the slice of ham flew into the milk - jug . She became suddenly serious , and fished for it with the empty fork . "
91496	91500	91446	91446	I	0	" she remarked , "
91538	91539	91529	91529	I	0	" "
91551	91556	91557	91557	I	0	" Dodo went on . "
91749	91773	91774	91774	I	0	" Dodo was eating her breakfast with an immense appetite and alarming rapidity , and she had finished as soon as the others . "
91782	91800	91774	91774	I	0	" she said , going to the door as soon as she had eaten all she wanted . "
91817	91835	91813	91813	you	0	" As she opened the door two large collies came bouncing in , panting from sheer excitement . "
91842	91858	91838	91838	you	0	" said Dodo , sitting down on the floor and going off at another tangent . "
91903	91949	91898	91898	you	104	" Dodo poured the milk into two clean saucers , and set them on the floor . There were a few drops left at the bottom of the jug , and she made a neat little pool on the head of each of the dogs . "
91955	91959	91960	91960	They	1843	" she asked . "
92080	92100	92077	92078	Lady Grantham	191	" Dodo 's questions were purely rhetorical ; they required no answer , and she did not expect one . "
92113	92117	92118	92118	Nobody	247	" she said . "
92274	92322	92323	92323	Edith	104	" Dodo delivered herself of these surprising statements with great rapidity , and left the room to get her cigarettes . She left the door wide open , and in a minute or two her voice was heard from the drawing - room , screaming to Edith . "
92342	92343	92323	92323	Edith	104	" "
92354	92376	92323	92323	Edith	104	" thought Edith , as she went to the drawing - room , where Dodo was playing snatches of dance music . "
92383	92387	92381	92381	Edith	104	" commanded Dodo . "
92406	92407	92412	92412	your	104	" "
92418	92426	92412	92412	your	104	" said Dodo , as Edith finished . "
92452	92576	92440	92440	You	104	" Lady Grantham had followed Edith , and sat down , with her atmosphere of impenetrable leisure , near the piano . Dodo made her feel uncomfortably old . She felt Dodo 's extravagantly high spirits were a sort of milestone to show , how far she herself had travelled from youth . It was impossible to conceive of Dodo ever getting middle - aged or elderly . She had racked her brains in vain to try to think of any woman of her own age who could possibly ever have been as insolently young as Dodo . She had the habit , as I have mentioned before , of making strangely direct remarks , and she turned to Dodo and said : — "
92598	92599	92593	92593	you	1856	" "
92606	92611	92600	92600	I	0	" declared Dodo confidently . "
92761	92762	92745	92745	I	0	" "
92773	92777	92764	92764	you	0	" asked Edith . "
92787	92791	92782	92782	I	0	" said Dodo ; "
92885	93184	93235	93235	he	279	" Dodo had quite forgotten that she had intended to go for a ride , and she went into the garden with Nora , and played ducks and drakes on the pond , and punted herself about , and gathered water - lilies . Then she was seized with an irresistible desire to fish , and caught a large pike , which refused to be killed , and Dodo had to fetch the gardener to slay it . She then talked an astonishing amount of perfect nonsense , and thought that it must be lunch - time . Accordingly , she went back to the house , and was found by Edith , a quarter of an hour later , playing hide - and - seek with the coachman 's children , whom she had lured in from the stable - yard as she went by . The rules were that the searchers were to catch the hiders , and Dodo had entrenched herself behind the piano , and erected an impregnable barricade , consisting of a revolving bookcase and the music - stool . The two seekers entirely declined to consider that she had won , and Dodo , with a show of reason , was telling them that they had n't caught her yet at any rate . The situation seemed to admit of no compromise and no solution , unless , as Dodo suggested , they got a pound or two of blasting powder and destroyed her defences . However , a deus ex machina appeared in the person of the coachman himself , who had come in for orders , and hinted darkly that maternal vengeance was brewing if certain persons did not wash their hands in time for dinner , which was imminent . "
93193	93206	93207	93207	I	0	" said Edith to Dodo , as she emerged hot and victorious . "
93226	93232	93218	93219	The messenger	1862	" Dodo became suddenly grave . "
93242	93246	93235	93235	he	279	" she said ; "
93262	93341	93255	93255	I	0	" She met the man walking back to the house , having looked for her in vain . She took the telegram and opened it . It had been forwarded from her London house . It was very short . Dodo experienced , in epitome at that moment , all she had gone through the night before . She went to a garden - seat , and remained there in silence so long that the footman asked her : "
93356	93384	93351	93352	The messenger	1862	" Dodo held out her hand for the telegraph form . She addressed it to the caretaker at her London house . It also was very short : "
93398	93611	93614	93614	he	1867	" She handed it to the man , and gave orders that it should go at once . Dodo did not move . She sat still with her hands clasped in front of her , unconscious of active thought , only knowing that a stream of pictures seemed to pass before her eyes . She saw the Prince standing on her doorstep , learning with surprise that Lady Chesterford was not at home , and that her address was not known . She saw him turn away , baffled but not beaten ; she saw him remaining in London day after day , waiting for the house in Eaton Square to show some signs of life . She saw — ah , she dismissed that picture quickly . She had one sudden impulse to call back the footman and ask for another telegraph form ; but she felt if she could only keep a firm hand on herself for a few moments , the worst would be passed ; and it was with a sense of overwhelming relief that she saw the telegraph boy walk off down the drive with the reply in his hand . Then it suddenly struck her that the Prince was waiting for the answer at Dover Station . "
93618	93622	93614	93614	he	1867	" thought Dodo . "
93653	93760	93649	93651	the telegraph boys	1871	" The idea of the Prince waiting at Dover was distinctly amusing , and Dodo found a broad smile to bestow on the thought before she continued examining the state of her feelings and position . The Prince 's influence over her she felt was local and personal , so to speak , and now she had made her decision , she was surprised at the ease with which it had been made . Had he been there in person , with his courtly presence and his serene remoteness from anything ordinary , and had said , in that smooth , well - modulated , voice , "
93772	93780	93762	93762	I	0	" Dodo felt that she would have said "
93783	93841	93762	93762	I	0	" Her pride was in frantic rebellion at these admissions ; even the telegram she had sent was a confession of weakness . She would not see him , because she was afraid . Was there any other reason ? she asked herself . Yes ; she could not see him because she longed to see him . "
93848	94231	93762	93762	I	0	" she thought , as she crumpled up the telegram which had fluttered down from her lap on to the grass . Dodo felt she was quite unnecessarily honest with herself in making this admission . But what followed ? Nothing followed . She was going to marry Jack , and be remarkably happy , and Prince Waldenech should come and stay with them because she liked him very much , and she would be delightfully kind to him , and Jack should like him too . Dear old Jack , she would write him a line this minute , saying when she would be back in London . Dodo felt a sudden spasm of anger against the Prince . What right had he to behave like this ? He was making it very hard for her , and he would get nothing by it . Her decision was irrevocable ; she would not see him again , for some time at any rate . She would get over this ridiculous fear of him . What was he that other men were not ? What was the position , after all ? He had wanted to marry her ; she had refused him because she was engaged to Jack . If there had been no Jack — well , there was a Jack , so it was unnecessary to pursue that any further . He had given her his photograph , and had said several things that he should not have said . Dodo thought of that scene with regret . She had had an opportunity which she had missed ; she might easily have made it plain to him that his murmured speeches went beyond mere courtesy . Instead of that she had said she would always regard him as a great friend , and hoped he would see her often . She tapped the ground impatiently as she thought of missed opportunities . It was stupid , inconceivably stupid of her . Then he had followed her to England , and sent this telegram . She did not feel safe . She longed , and dreaded to see him again . It was too absurd that she should have to play this gigantic game of hide - and - seek . "
94251	94255	94245	94245	I	0	" thought Dodo . "
94274	94646	94267	94267	he	3088	" Meanwhile the Prince was smoking a cigar at Dover Station . The telegram had not come , though he had waited an hour , and he had settled to give it another half - hour and then go on to London . He was not at all angry ; it was as good as a game of chess . The Prince was very fond of chess . He enjoyed exercising a calculating long - sightedness , and he felt that the Marchioness of Chesterford elect was a problem that enabled him to exercise this faculty , of which he had plenty , to the full . He had a sublime sense of certainty as to what he was going to do . He fully intended to marry Dodo , and he admitted no obstacles . She was engaged to Jack , was she ? So much the worse for Jack . She wished to marry Jack , did she ? So much the worse for her , and none the worse , possibly the better , for him . As it was quite certain that he himself was going to marry Dodo , these little hitches were entertaining than otherwise . It is more fun to catch your salmon after a quarter of an hour 's rather exciting fight with him than to net him . Half the joy of a possession lies in the act of acquisition , and the pleasure of acquisition consists , at least in half of the excitement attendant on it . To say that the Prince ever regarded anyone 's feelings would be understating the truth . The fact that his will worked its way in opposition to , and at the expense of others , afforded him a distinct and appreciable pleasure . If he wanted anything he went straight for it , and regarded neither man , nor devil , nor angel ; and he wanted Dodo . His mind , then , was thoroughly made up . She seemed to him immensely original and very complete . He read her , he thought , like a book , and the book was very interesting reading . His sending of the telegram with "
94650	94707	94267	94267	he	3088	" was a positive stroke of genius . Dodo had told him that she was going straight to London , but , as we have seen , she did not stop the night there , but went straight on to Edith 's home in Berkshire . There were two courses open to her ; either to reply "
94709	94711	94267	94267	he	3088	" or "
94713	94728	94267	94267	he	3088	" to the telegram , or to leave it unanswered . If she left it "
94730	95008	95325	95325	sir	1343	" it would delight him above measure , and it seemed that his wishes were to be realised . Not answering the telegram would imply that she did not think good to see him , and he judged that this decision was probably prompted by something deeper than mere indifference to his company . It must be dictated by a strong motive . His calculations were a little at fault , because Dodo had not stopped in London , but this made no difference , as events had turned out , to the correctness of his deductions . He very much wished Dodo to be influenced by strong motives in her dealings with him . He would not have accepted , even as a gift , the real , quiet liking she had for Jack . Real , quiet likings seemed to him to be as dull as total indifference . He would not have objected to her regarding him with violent loathing , that would be something to correct ; and his experience in such affairs was that strong sympathies and antipathies were more akin to each other than quiet affection or an apathetic indifference were to either . He walked up and down the platform with the smile of a man who is waiting for an interesting situation in a theatrical representation to develop itself . He had no wish to hurry it . The by - play seemed to him to be very suitable , and he bought a morning paper . He glanced through the leaders , and turned to the small society paragraphs . The first that struck his eye was this : "
95022	95108	95009	95012	The Marchioness of Chesterford	1558	" He felt it was the most orthodox way of bringing the scene to its climax . Enter a newsboy , who hands paper to Prince , and exit . Prince unfolds paper and reads the news of — well , of what he is expecting . He snipped the paragraph neatly out from the paper , and put it in his card - case . His valet was standing by the telegraph office , waiting for the message . The Prince beckoned to him . "
95115	95119	95120	95120	We	1876	" he said . "
95127	95190	95120	95120	We	1876	" The Prince had a carriage reserved for him , and he stepped in with a sense of great satisfaction . He even went so far as to touch his hat in response to the obeisances of the obsequious guard , and told his valet to see that the man got something . He soon determined on his next move — a decided "
95193	95306	95120	95120	We	1876	" and rather an awkward one ; and for the rest of his journey he amused himself by looking out of the window , and admiring the efficient English farming . All the arrangements seemed to him to be very solid and adequate . The hedges were charming . The cart horses were models of sturdy strength , and the hop harvest promised to be very fine . He was surprised when they drew near London . The journey had been shorter than he expected . He gave a few directions to his valet about luggage , and drove off to Eaton Square . The door was opened by an impenetrable caretaker . "
95312	95317	95308	95309	Lady Chesterford	100	" asked the Prince . "
95327	95349	95325	95325	sir	1343	" replied the man . The Prince smiled . Dodo was evidently acting up to her refusal to answer his telegram . "
95355	95359	95325	95325	sir	1343	" he remarked . "
95372	95389	95368	95368	I	0	" He drew from his pocket a card , and the cutting from the Morning Post . "
95397	95402	95390	95391	Her ladyship	1323	" the man repeated . "
95412	95422	95404	95404	you	1881	" said the Prince , feeling in his pockets . "
95440	95445	95404	95404	you	1881	" replied the caretaker . "
95459	95496	95447	95447	you	0	" Certainly , he would fetch it . The Prince waited serenely . Everything was going admirably . The telegram was fetched . It had been handed in at Wokingham station at a quarter to one . "
95504	95509	95447	95447	you	0	" reflected the Prince . "
95520	95525	95511	95511	you	1881	" he asked blandly . "
95530	95585	95511	95511	you	1881	" The Prince was very much obliged . He left a large gratuity in the man 's hand , and wished him good afternoon . He drove straight to his house , and sent for his valet , whom he could trust implicitly , and who had often been employed on somewhat delicate affairs . "
95597	95601	95511	95511	you	1881	" he said . "
95621	95622	95612	95613	Lady Chesterford	100	" "
95628	95629	95612	95613	Lady Chesterford	100	" "
95639	95652	95632	95632	your	1181	" said the Prince negligently , turning away and lighting a cigar . "
95672	95705	95706	95706	I	0	" The Prince was sitting over a late breakfast on the following morning , when a telegram was brought in . He read it , and his eyes twinkled with genuine amusement . "
95709	95715	95706	95706	I	0	" he said to himself , "
95723	95924	95716	95716	I	0	" If Dodo had felt some excusable pride in having torn up the Prince 's photograph , her refusal to let him know where she was gave her a still more vivid sense of something approaching heroism . She did not blame anyone but herself for the position into which she had drifted during those weeks in Switzerland . She was quite conscious that she might have stopped any intimacy of this sort arising , and consequently the establishment of this power over her . But she felt she was regaining her lost position . Each sensible refusal to admit his influence over her was the sensible tearing asunder of the fibres which enveloped her . It was hard work , she admitted , but she was quite surprised to find how comfortable she was becoming . Jack really made a very satisfactory background to her thoughts . She was very fond of him , and she looked forward to their marriage with an eager expectancy , which , was partly , however , the result of another fear . She was sitting in the drawing - room next day with Miss Grantham , talking about nothing particular very rapidly . "
95936	95941	95942	95942	one	2148	" she was saying ; "
96042	96043	96032	96037	A sort of lay - reader	1891	" "
96053	96058	96044	96044	I	0	" said Miss Grantham . "
96078	96079	96061	96061	I	0	" "
96088	96093	96086	96086	Grantie	109	" said Dodo fervently , "
96183	96184	96210	96210	I	0	" "
96190	96195	96210	96210	I	0	" said Miss Grantham . "
96238	96239	96228	96228	you	1888	" "
96247	96252	96242	96242	I	0	" said Dodo serenely , "
96341	96342	96345	96345	you	0	" "
96350	96360	96345	96345	you	0	" asked Miss Grantham , pursuing the Socratic method . "
96374	96378	96345	96345	you	0	" said Dodo , "
96404	96405	96406	96406	Your	0	" "
96414	96419	96406	96406	Your	0	" remarked Miss Grantham . "
96430	96434	96435	96435	My	0	" said Dodo . "
96454	96455	96456	96456	You	0	" "
96463	96468	96469	96469	Edith	104	" said Miss Grantham . "
96471	96487	96469	96469	Edith	104	" she went on , as Miss Staines entered in a howling wilderness of dogs , "
96494	96495	96488	96488	Dodo	79	" "
96498	96502	96488	96488	Dodo	79	" asked Edith . "
96511	96515	96488	96488	Dodo	79	" said Dodo ; "
96529	96530	96522	96522	I	0	" "
96539	96543	96544	96544	I	0	" said Edith . "
96550	96557	96544	96544	I	0	" She handed Dodo a card . "
96561	96568	96544	96544	I	0	" she said quietly to herself , "
96583	96643	96577	96577	You	104	" Dodo got up and stood by the mantelpiece , and displayed an elaborate attention to one of Edith 's dogs . She was angry with herself for needing this minute of preparation , but she certainly used it to the best advantage ; and when the Prince entered she greeted him with an entirely natural smile of welcome . "
96650	96658	96577	96577	You	104	" she said , advancing to him . "
96669	96670	96662	96662	you	1900	" "
96680	96696	96671	96671	I	0	" said the Prince , lying with conscious satisfaction as he could not be contradicted , "
96705	96720	96721	96721	I	0	" Dodo introduced him to Edith and Miss Grantham , and sat down again . "
96738	96748	96727	96727	I	0	" she said , following the Prince 's lead . "
96771	96772	96761	96761	I	0	" "
96779	96784	96773	96774	Lord Chesterford	80	" asked the Prince . "
96819	96820	96817	96817	him	78	" "
96828	96833	96834	96834	I	0	" said the Prince . "
96848	96853	96839	96839	you	1900	" said Dodo lightly ; "

96887	96892	96882	96882	you	0	" said the Prince , "
96912	96916	96903	96903	he	78	" Dodo laughed . "
96923	96927	96903	96903	he	78	" she said . "
96940	96941	96942	96942	I	0	" "
96948	96952	96942	96942	I	0	" he said . "
96962	96966	96955	96955	you	0	" said Dodo ; "
96984	96985	96972	96972	Edith	104	" "
96996	97000	96988	96988	you	0	" he asked . "
97012	97013	97001	97001	You	0	" "
97020	97024	97014	97015	No one	2046	" said Dodo ; "
97053	97054	97050	97051	Mark Twain	235	" "
97074	97079	97071	97072	a doctor	1909	" said the Prince ; "
97104	97105	97111	97111	he	1910	" "
97119	97124	97117	97117	you	0	" remarked Miss Grantham . "
97127	97132	97117	97117	you	0	" said the Prince ; "
97144	97145	97111	97111	he	1910	" "
97151	97157	97111	97111	he	1910	" said Dodo , unceremoniously . "
97256	97257	97270	97270	Dodo	79	" "
97275	97357	97270	97270	Dodo	79	" asked Edith , who was growing uneasy . The Prince , as Dodo once said , never made a fool of himself . It was a position in which it was extremely easy for a stupid man to say something very awkward . Lady Grantham , with all her talent for asking inconvenient questions , could not have formed a more unpleasant one . He looked across at Dodo a moment , and said , without a perceptible pause , — "
97383	97398	97399	97399	Your	79	" The words startled Dodo somehow . She looked up and met his eye . "
97409	97413	97399	97399	Your	79	" she said . "
97452	97453	97440	97440	You	79	" "
97465	97470	97471	97471	You	79	" said the Prince . "
97478	97486	97471	97471	You	79	" Dodo rose and began to laugh . "
97495	97499	97500	97500	He	78	" she said . "
97526	97607	97519	97519	Jack	78	" Dodo felt strongly the necessity of putting an end to this conversation , which was effectually done by this somewhat uncourteous speech . The fencing had become rather too serious to please her , and she did not wish to be serious . But she felt oppressively conscious of this man 's personality , and saw that he was stronger than she was herself . She decided to retreat , and made a desperate effort to be entirely flippant . "
97621	97625	97626	97626	I	0	" she said . "
97654	97655	97656	97656	She	2902	" "
97665	97670	97656	97656	She	2902	" said the Prince , "
97691	97695	97687	97687	her	2902	" Dodo laughed . "
97700	97704	97687	97687	her	2902	" she said , "
97744	97745	97742	97742	her	2902	" "
97756	97761	97742	97742	her	2902	" remarked the Prince . "
97773	97778	97762	97762	I	0	" said Miss Grantham , "
97800	97810	97794	97794	you	1927	" This remarkable statement was instantly contradicted by Edith . "
97818	97822	97823	97823	You	1927	" she remarked . "
97861	97862	97856	97858	the dullest people	1928	" "
97880	97885	97869	97869	they	1928	" said Miss Grantham . "
97894	97898	97899	97899	I	0	" remarked Dodo . "
97978	98000	97971	97971	You	1931	" Dodo went on , introducing him with a wave of her hand , like a showman with a performing animal . "
98035	98036	98037	98037	He	2616	" "
98043	98048	98037	98037	He	2616	" said the Prince , "
98056	98057	98037	98037	He	2616	" "
98066	98070	98060	98060	I	0	" said Dodo . "
98089	98090	98091	98091	I	0	" "
98099	98104	98091	98091	I	0	" observed the Prince . "
98121	98122	98123	98123	I	0	" "
98132	98138	98139	98139	I	0	" said Dodo , reflectively : "
98154	98155	98139	98139	I	0	" "
98160	98165	98139	98139	I	0	" said the Prince . "
98175	98179	98180	98180	He	2616	" said she . "
98185	98186	98183	98183	himself	2616	" "
98197	98210	98194	98194	I	0	" said the Prince , alluding to his modern system of duelling . "
98221	98225	98218	98218	your	1931	" remarked Dodo , "
98412	98528	98409	98409	they	1938	" Dodo was conscious of talking rather wildly and incoherently . She felt like a swimmer being dragged down by a deep undercurrent . All she could do was to make a splash on the surface . She could not swim quietly or strongly out of its reach . She stood by the window playing with the blind cord , wishing that the Prince would not look at her . He had a sort of deep , lazy strength about him that made Dodo distrust herself — the indolent consciousness of power that a tiger has when he plays contemptuously with his prey before hitting it with one deadly blow of that soft cushioned paw . "
98539	98546	98532	98532	I	0	" she said to herself impatiently . "
98599	98616	98563	98563	He	1943	" Dodo plunged back into the room , and sat down in the chair next him . "
98626	98630	98563	98563	He	1943	" she said . "
98684	98685	98688	98688	Zermatt	51	" "
98690	98697	98688	98688	Zermatt	51	" said the Prince , meditatively . "
98708	98709	98688	98688	Zermatt	51	" "
98715	98720	98711	98711	you	0	" said Dodo negligently . "

98769	98773	98742	98742	you	0	" suggested Edith . "

98824	98829	98805	98805	his	78	" said the Prince . "

99003	99004	98998	98998	I	0	" "
99010	99026	98998	98998	I	0	" said the Prince . Dodo laughed , and held out her hand to him . "
99035	99039	99028	99028	you	436	" she said . "
99090	99091	99092	99092	Dodo	79	" "
99111	99118	99119	99119	he	2616	" You have made me angry , "
99127	99138	99119	99119	he	2616	" but you will pacify me again , I know . "
99229	99237	99238	99238	she	79	" Ah , you are just off ? "
99269	99279	99280	99280	she	79	" Come and see me in London any time , "
99287	99299	99280	99280	she	79	" I shall go back at the end of the week . "
99304	99313	99314	99314	he	2616	" I knew you would pacify me again , "
99954	99963	99949	99949	She	79	" Jack , Prince Waldenech was at Wokingham . "
99964	99971	99973	99973	Jack	78	" What was he there for ? "
99976	99985	99987	99987	Dodo	79	" I think he came to see me , "
99990	99999	100000	100000	he	78	" I hope you did n't see him , "
100012	100017	100018	100018	she	79	" I saw him , "
100021	100123	100018	100018	she	79	" because he came to see me , as they say in the French exercise books . I could n't hide my head under the hearthrug like an ostrich — hot that they hide their heads under hearth - rugs , but the principle is the same . He walked in as cool as a cucumber , and said , ' Howdy ? ' So we talked , and he said he 'd be glad to call you out , and you 'd be glad to call him out , and we generally chattered , and then I made him angry . "
100124	100134	100136	100136	Jack	78	" Why did he propose to call me out ? "
100139	100151	100153	100153	Dodo	79	" Oh , he said he would n't call you out , "
100155	100182	100153	100153	Dodo	79	" He said nothing would induce him to . I never said he proposed to call you out . You 're stupid this morning , Jack . "
100183	100191	100192	100192	Dodo	79	" That man is an unutterable cad . "
100197	100207	100208	100208	she	79	" Oh , he 's nothing of the kind , "
100211	100234	100208	100208	she	79	" Besides , he 's a great friend of mine , so even if he was a cad it would n't matter . "
100235	100243	100245	100245	Jack	78	" How did you make him angry ? "
100247	100294	100295	100295	Jack	78	" I told him I was going away to write some letters . It was rather damping , was n't it ? I had n't got any letters to write , and he knew it , and I knew he knew it , and so on . "
100367	100374	100375	100375	she	79	" Nothing is ever the matter , "
100379	100416	100375	100375	she	79	" and if it was , my not telling you would show that I did n't wish for sympathy , or help , or anything else . I tell you all I want you to know . "
100417	100435	100437	100437	Jack	78	" You mean something is the matter , and you do n't want me to know it , "
100744	100751	100752	100752	she	79	" How dare you think that ? "
100765	100768	100769	100769	he	78	" Dodo , "
100773	100844	100769	100769	he	78	" you have no right to say that , but you have said it now . If there is not anything I had better know , just tell me so , for your own sake and for mine . I can only plead for your forgiveness . It was by no will of mine that such a thought crossed my mind . You can afford to be generous , Dodo . "
100854	100862	100863	100863	she	79	" You are simply forcing my confidence , "
100866	100882	100863	100863	she	79	" If it was something you had better know , do you suppose that — — "
100900	100909	100910	100910	he	78	" You are not very generous to me , "
100913	100923	100910	100910	he	78	" We are old friends though we are lovers . "
100924	100936	100938	100938	Dodo	79	" Take care you do n't lose my friendship , then , "
100941	100989	100938	100938	Dodo	79	" It is no use saying ' auld lang syne ' when ' auld lang syne ' is in danger . It would be like singing ' God save the Queen ' when she was dying . You should never recall old memories when they are strained . "
101004	101013	101014	101014	he	78	" Dodo , you really are rather unreasonable , "
101017	101040	101014	101014	he	78	" To begin with , you quarrel with an unspoken thought , and you have n't even given me a definite accusation . "
101041	101054	101056	101056	Dodo	79	" That is because it is unnecessary , and you know it , "
101058	101091	101056	101056	Dodo	79	" However , as you like . You think you have cause to be jealous or foolish or melodramatic about Prince Waldenech . Dear me , it is quite like old times . "
101098	101121	101122	101122	he	78	" If you propose to treat me as you treated that poor man , who was the best man I ever knew , "
101125	101152	101122	101122	he	78	" the sooner you learn your mistake the better for us both . It would have been in better taste not to have referred to that . "
101153	101162	101164	101164	Dodo	79	" At present that is beside the point , "
101166	101178	101164	101164	Dodo	79	" Was that your unspoken thought , or was it not ? "
101179	101197	101199	101199	Jack	78	" If I would not insult you by speaking my thought whether you are right or not , "
101201	101362	101164	101164	Dodo	79	" I shall not insult you by answering that question . My answer shall take another form . Listen , Dodo . The Prince is in love with you . He proposed to you at Zermatt . That passionless inhuman piece of mechanism , his sister , told me how much he was in love with you . She meant it as a compliment . He is a dangerous , bad man . He forces himself on you . He went down to Wokingham to see you ; you told me so yourself . He is dangerous and strong . For God 's sake keep away from him . I do n't distrust you ; but I am afraid you may get to distrust yourself . He will make you afraid of crossing his will . Dodo , will you do this for me ? It is quite unreasonable probably , but I am unreasonable when I think of you . "
101363	101370	101372	101372	Dodo	79	" Oh , my dear Jack , "
101375	101511	101372	101372	Dodo	79	" you really make me angry . It is dreadfully bad form to be angry , and it is absurd that you and I should quarrel . You 've got such a low opinion of me ; though I suppose that 's as much my fault as yours . Your opinion is fiction , but I am the fact on which it is founded , and what do you take me for ? The Prince telegraphed from Dover to ask if I would see him , and I deliberately sent no answer . How he found out where I was I do n't know . I suppose he got hold of the telegram I sent here to say my address was uncertain . Does that look as if I wanted to see him so dreadfully ? "
101512	101523	101525	101525	Jack	78	" I never said you did want to see him , "
101527	101545	101525	101525	Jack	78	" I said he very much wanted to see you , and what you say proves it . "
101546	101552	101554	101554	Dodo	79	" Well , what then ? "
101556	101599	101554	101554	Dodo	79	" You wanted to see me very much when I was married . Would you have thought it reasonable if Chesterford had entreated me never to see you — to keep away for God 's sake , as you said just now ? "
101600	101607	101609	101609	Jack	78	" I am not the Prince , "
101611	101639	101609	101609	Jack	78	" neither am I going to be treated as you treated your husband . Do not let us refer to him again ; it is a desecration . "
101640	101666	101554	101554	Dodo	79	" You mean that in the light of subsequent events it would have been reasonable in him to ask me to keep away from you ? "
101667	101670	101672	101672	he	78	" Yes , "
101729	101743	101744	101744	she	79	" Perhaps you do not see that you involve me in your confession , "
101750	101762	101744	101744	she	79	" I decline to be judged by your standards , thanks . "
101794	101808	101774	101774	She	79	" Apparently you decline to consider the fact of other standards at all . "
101809	101821	101822	101822	she	79	" I do n't accept views which seem to me unreasonable , "
101825	101869	101822	101822	she	79	" I only ask you to consider this particular view . The story you have just told me shows that he is anxious to see you , which was my point . That he is dangerous and strong I ask you to accept . "
101870	101877	101878	101878	she	79	" What if I do n't ? "
101881	101884	101886	101886	he	78	" This , "
101888	101951	101886	101886	he	78	" When a man of that sort desires anything , as he evidently desires you , there is danger . If you are alive to it , and as strong as he is , you are safe . That you are not alive to it you show by your present position ; that you are as strong as he , I doubt . "
101952	101959	101961	101961	Dodo	79	" You assume far too much , "
101963	102015	101961	101961	Dodo	79	" What you mean by my present position I do n't care to know . But I am perfectly alive to the whole state of the case . Wait . I will speak . I entirely decline to be dictated to . I shall do as I choose in this matter . "
102016	102025	102027	102027	Jack	78	" Do you quite realise what that means ? "
102075	102080	102081	102081	she	79	" It means this , "
102084	102173	102174	102174	She	1997	" He will be here in a minute or two ; I told him I should be in at twelve . I am going to ring the bell and tell the man to show him up . You will stay here , and treat him as one man should treat another . If you are insolent to him , understand that you include me . You will imply that you distrust me . Perhaps you would ring the bell for me , as you are closer to it . "
102194	102203	102204	102204	he	78	" I will be perfectly explicit with you , "
102207	102249	102250	102250	He	78	" If you see him , you see him alone . I do not wish to hear what he has to say to you . As he enters the door I leave it . That is all . You may choose . "
102255	102267	102269	102269	Dodo	79	" There is no reason for you to wait till then , "
102271	102292	102293	102293	she	79	" I am going to see him as soon as he comes . Tell Prince Waldenech that I am in , "
102299	102309	102293	102293	she	79	" Show him up as soon as he comes . "
102318	102321	102323	102323	Dodo	79	" Well ? "
102325	102333	102323	102323	Dodo	79	" I am making up my mind . "
102340	102349	102353	102353	himself	78	" What on earth are we quarrelling about ? "
102355	102380	102353	102353	himself	78	" Is it simply whether I stop here and talk to that cad ? I wonder if all women are as obstinate as this . "
102434	102441	102443	102443	he	78	" I think I am going , "
102445	102464	102443	102443	he	78	" I sha'n't see you again till to - morrow afternoon . I am away to - night . "
102485	102493	102494	102494	he	78	" Really , this is extraordinarily childish , "
102497	102518	102494	102494	he	78	" I sha'n't stop to see the Prince because he is a detestable cad . Think it over , Dodo . "
102586	102591	102592	102592	he	78	" Ah , Dodo , "
102651	102664	102665	102665	he	78	" His lordship does me the honour to be jealous of me , "
102728	102734	102735	102735	he	78	" Is Lady Chesterford in ? "
102764	102774	102760	102760	he	520	" Her Serene Highness left for Paris this morning . "
