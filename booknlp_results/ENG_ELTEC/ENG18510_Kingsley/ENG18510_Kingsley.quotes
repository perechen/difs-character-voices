413	521	387	387	his	172	‘ Monday , 21st.—Wind S.W. , bright sun , mercury at 30½ inches . Felt my heart expanded towards the universe . Organs of veneration and benevolence pleasingly excited ; and gave a shilling to a tramp . An inexpressible joy bounded through every vein , and the soft air breathed purity and self - sacrifice through my soul . As I watched the beetles , those children of the sun , who , as divine Shelley says , “ laden with light and odour , pass over the gleam of the living grass , ” I gained an Eden - glimpse of the pleasures of virtue . ‘
548	608	546	546	he	447	‘ Tuesday , 22d.—Barometer rapidly falling . Heavy clouds in the south - east . My heart sank into gloomy forebodings . Read Manfred , and doubted whether I should live long . The laden weight of destiny seemed to crush down my aching forehead , till the thunderstorm burst , and peace was restored to my troubled soul . ’

3192	3274	3279	3279	his	528	’ opinion of Reynard ’s course . The sportsmen galloped off towards the nearest bridge . Bracebridge looked back at Lancelot , who had been keeping by his side in sulky rivalry , following him successfully through all manner of desperate places , and more and more angry with himself and the guiltless colonel , because he only followed , while the colonel ’s quicker and unembarrassed wit , which lived wholly in the present moment , saw long before Lancelot , ‘
3282	3287	3279	3279	his	528	’ in every field . ‘
3294	3300	3288	3288	I	0	’ quietly observed the colonel . ‘

3407	3408	3397	3397	he	0	’ ‘
3412	3541	3397	3397	he	0	’ Lancelot could have knocked the unsuspecting colonel down for the word . It just expressed the contrast , which had fretted him ever since he began to hunt with the Whitford Priors hounds . The colonel ’s long practice and consummate skill in all he took in hand,—his experience of all society , from the prairie Indian to Crockford ’s , from the prize - ring to the continental courts,—his varied and ready store of information and anecdote,—the harmony and completeness of the man,—his consistency with his own small ideal , and his consequent apparent superiority everywhere and in everything to the huge awkward Titan - cub , who , though immeasurably beyond Bracebridge in intellect and heart , was still in a state of convulsive dyspepsia , ‘
3545	3588	3397	3397	he	0	’ and daily well - nigh choked ; diseased throughout with that morbid self - consciousness and lust of praise , for which God prepares , with His elect , a bitter cure . Alas ! poor Lancelot ! an unlicked bear , ‘
3596	3598	3618	3619	Old Lavington	136	’ — ‘
3602	3617	3618	3619	Old Lavington	136	’ quoth Bracebridge , between snatches of a tune , his coolness maddening Lancelot . ‘
3656	4112	3618	3619	Old Lavington	136	’ — And in an instant the small wiry American , and the huge Horncastle - bred hunter , were wallowing and staggering in the yeasty stream , till they floated into a deep reach , and swam steadily down to a low place in the bank . They crossed the stream , passed the Priory Shrubberies , leapt the gate into the park , and then on and upward , called by the unseen Ariel ’s music before them.—Up , into the hills ; past white crumbling chalk - pits , fringed with feathered juniper and tottering ashes , their floors strewed with knolls of fallen soil and vegetation , like wooded islets in a sea of milk.—Up , between steep ridges of tuft crested with black fir - woods and silver beech , and here and there a huge yew standing out alone , the advanced sentry of the forest , with its luscious fretwork of green velvet , like a mountain of Gothic spires and pinnacles , all glittering and steaming as the sun drank up the dew - drops . The lark sprang upward into song , and called merrily to the new - opened sunbeams , while the wreaths and flakes of mist lingered reluctantly about the hollows , and clung with dewy fingers to every knoll and belt of pine.—Up into the labyrinthine bosom of the hills,—but who can describe them ? Is not all nature indescribable ? every leaf infinite and transcendental ? How much more those mighty downs , with their enormous sheets of spotless turf , where the dizzy eye loses all standard of size and distance before the awful simplicity , the delicate vastness , of those grand curves and swells , soft as the outlines of a Greek Venus , as if the great goddess - mother Hertha had laid herself down among the hills to sleep , her Titan limbs wrapt in a thin veil of silvery green . Up , into a vast amphitheatre of sward , whose walls banked out the narrow sky above . And here , in the focus of the huge ring , an object appeared which stirred strange melancholy in Lancelot,—a little chapel , ivy - grown , girded with a few yews , and elders , and grassy graves . A climbing rose over the porch , and iron railings round the churchyard , told of human care ; and from the graveyard itself burst up one of those noble springs known as winter - bournes in the chalk ranges , which , awakened in autumn from the abysses to which it had shrunk during the summer ’s drought , was hurrying down upon its six months ’

4275	4397	4268	4268	thy	546	’ And his sadness , foolish as it may seem , grew as he watched a brown speck fleet rapidly up the opposite hill , and heard a gay view - halloo burst from the colonel at his side . The chase lost its charm for him the moment the game was seen . Then vanished that mysterious delight of pursuing an invisible object , which gives to hunting and fishing their unutterable and almost spiritual charm ; which made Shakespeare a nightly poacher ; Davy and Chantrey the patriarchs of fly - fishing ; by which the twelve - foot rod is transfigured into an enchanter ’s wand , potent over the unseen wonders of the water - world , to ‘
4406	4410	4268	4268	thy	546	’ which will really ‘

5032	5041	5030	5030	herself	150	‘ but so clever , and so unhappy ! ’

5311	5318	5286	5289	Half a dozen voices	584	‘ He ’s had a fall ! ’

5352	5554	5557	5557	himself	586	’ shouted the colonel , as Shiver - the - timbers rushed at the high pales , out of breath , and blind with rage . Lancelot saw and heard nothing till he was awakened from his dream by the long heave of the huge brute ’s shoulder , and the maddening sensation of sweeping through the air over the fence . He started , checked the curb , the horse threw up his head , fulfilling his name by driving his knees like a battering - ram against the pales — the top - bar bent like a withe , flew out into a hundred splinters , and man and horse rolled over headlong into the hard flint - road . For one long sickening second Lancelot watched the blue sky between his own knees . Then a crash as if a shell had burst in his face — a horrible grind — a sheet of flame — and the blackness of night . Did you ever feel it , reader ? When he awoke , he found himself lying in bed , with Squire Lavington sitting by him . There was real sorrow in the old man ’s face , ‘
5559	5568	5557	5557	himself	586	’ and a great joyful oath rolled out . ‘
5594	5595	5599	5599	squire	588	’ ‘
5601	5611	5612	5612	Smith	137	’ answered a laughing voice from behind the curtain . ‘
5628	5658	5659	5659	I	0	’ I heard a story the other day of our most earnest and genial humorist , who is just now proving himself also our most earnest and genial novelist . ‘
5665	5670	5659	5659	I	0	’ said a lady ; ‘
5701	5706	5679	5680	the baronet	591	’ The artist laughed . ‘
5711	5715	5679	5680	the baronet	591	’ said he , ‘
5727	5745	5679	5680	the baronet	591	’ So it is . People do not see the strange things which pass them every day . ‘
5751	6126	5679	5680	the baronet	591	’ is only one to the romantic spirit . And then they set up for critics , instead of pupils ; as if the artist ’s business was not just to see what they can not see — to open their eyes to the harmonies and the discords , the miracles and the absurdities , which seem to them one uniform gray fog of commonplaces . Then let the reader believe , that whatsoever is commonplace in my story is my own invention . Whatsoever may seem extravagant or startling is most likely to be historic fact , else I should not have dared to write it down , finding God ’s actual dealings here much too wonderful to dare to invent many fresh ones for myself . Lancelot , who had had a severe concussion of the brain and a broken leg , kept his bed for a few weeks , and his room for a few more . Colonel Bracebridge installed himself at the Priory , and nursed him with indefatigable good - humour and few thanks . He brought Lancelot his breakfast before hunting , described the run to him when he returned , read him to sleep , told him stories of grizzly bear and buffalo - hunts , made him laugh in spite of himself at extempore comic medleys , kept his tables covered with flowers from the conservatory , warmed his chocolate , and even his bed . Nothing came amiss to him , and he to nothing . Lancelot longed at first every hour to be rid of him , and eyed him about the room as a bulldog does the monkey who rides him . In his dreams he was Sinbad the Sailor , and Bracebridge the Old Man of the Sea ; but he could not hold out against the colonel ’s merry bustling kindliness , and the almost womanish tenderness of his nursing . The ice thawed rapidly ; and one evening it split up altogether , when Bracebridge , who was sitting drawing by Lancelot ’s sofa , instead of amusing himself with the ladies below , suddenly threw his pencil into the fire , and broke out , à propos de rien — ‘
6160	6193	6194	6194	I	0	’ There was something in the colonel ’s tone so utterly different from his usual courtly and measured speech , that Lancelot was taken completely by surprise , and stammered out , — ‘
6219	6228	6214	6214	I	0	’ he said , with a sudden impulse , ‘
6236	6237	6230	6230	I	0	’ ‘
6243	6248	6249	6249	I	0	’ quoth the colonel : ‘
6266	6267	6249	6249	I	0	’ ‘
6270	6275	6277	6277	you	137	’ said Lancelot slowly , ‘
6294	6313	6314	6314	I	0	’ The colonel laughed , not quite merrily . Lancelot went on , holding down his shaggy brows . ‘
6342	6343	6340	6340	you	137	’ ‘
6346	6347	6340	6340	you	137	’ ‘
6441	6477	6478	6479	Mr. Smith	137	’ The colonel griped his hand hard , rose , and looked out of the window for a few minutes . There was a dead , brooding silence , till he turned to Lancelot , — ‘
6613	6674	6609	6609	I	0	’ There was a terrible earnestness about the guardsman ’s face which could not be mistaken . Lancelot looked at him for a moment , and then dropped his eyes ashamed , as if he had intruded on the speaker ’s confidence by witnessing his emotion . In a moment the colonel had returned to his smile and his polish . ‘
6719	6759	6760	6761	Happy man	607	’ And the colonel pulled a pack of cards out of his pocket , and seeing that Lancelot was too thoughtful for play , commenced all manner of juggler ’s tricks , and chuckled over them like any schoolboy . ‘
6763	6767	6760	6761	Happy man	607	’ thought Lancelot , ‘
6785	7367	6692	6692	you	137	’ No , Lancelot ! more happy are they whom God will not allow to thrust their thoughts from them till the bitter draught has done its work . From that day , however , there was a cordial understanding between the two . They never alluded to the subject ; but they had known the bottom of each other ’s heart . Lancelot ’s sick - room was now pleasant enough , and he drank in daily his new friend ’s perpetual stream of anecdote , till March and hunting were past , and April was half over . The old squire came up after dinner regularly ( during March he had hunted every day , and slept every evening ) ; and the trio chatted along merrily enough , by the help of whist and backgammon , upon the surface of this little island of life,—which is , like Sinbad ’s , after all only the back of a floating whale , ready to dive at any moment.—And then ? — But what was Argemone doing all this time ? Argemone was busy in her boudoir ( too often a true boudoir to her ) among books and statuettes , and dried flowers , fancying herself , and not unfairly , very intellectual . She had four new manias every year ; her last winter ’s one had been that bottle - and - squirt mania , miscalled chemistry ; her spring madness was for the Greek drama . She had devoured Schlegel ’s lectures , and thought them divine ; and now she was hard at work on Sophocles , with a little help from translations , and thought she understood him every word . Then she was somewhat High - Church in her notions , and used to go up every Wednesday and Friday to the chapel in the hills , where Lancelot had met her , for an hour ’s mystic devotion , set off by a little graceful asceticism . As for Lancelot , she never thought of him but as an empty - headed fox - hunter who had met with his deserts ; and the brilliant accounts which the all smoothing colonel gave at dinner of Lancelot ’s physical well doing and agreeable conversation only made her set him down the sooner as a twin clever - do - nothing to the despised Bracebridge , whom she hated for keeping her father in a roar of laughter . But her sister , little Honoria , had all the while been busy messing and cooking with her own hands for the invalid ; and almost fell in love with the colonel for his watchful kindness . And here a word about Honoria , to whom Nature , according to her wo nt with sisters , had given almost everything which Argemone wanted , and denied almost everything which Argemone had , except beauty . And even in that , the many - sided mother had made her a perfect contrast to her sister,—tiny and luscious , dark - eyed and dark - haired ; as full of wild simple passion as an Italian , thinking little , except where she felt much — which was , indeed , everywhere ; for she lived in a perpetual April - shower of exaggerated sympathy for all suffering , whether in novels or in life ; and daily gave the lie to that shallow old calumny , that ‘
7377	7460	6692	6692	you	137	’ Argemone was almost angry with her sometimes , when she trotted whole days about the village from school to sick - room : perhaps conscience hinted to her that her duty , too , lay rather there than among her luxurious day - dreams . But , alas ! though she would have indignantly repelled the accusation of selfishness , yet in self and for self alone she lived ; and while she had force of will for any so - called ‘
7465	7826	6692	6692	you	137	’ and would fast herself cross and stupefied , and quite enjoy kneeling thinly clad and barefoot on the freezing chapel - floor on a winter ’s morning , yet her fastidious delicacy revolted at sitting , like Honoria , beside the bed of the ploughman ’s consumptive daughter , in a reeking , stifling , lean - to garret , in which had slept the night before , the father , mother , and two grown - up boys , not to mention a new - married couple , the sick girl , and , alas ! her baby . And of such bedchambers there were too many in Whitford Priors . The first evening that Lancelot came downstairs , Honoria clapped her hands outright for joy as he entered , and ran up and down for ten minutes , fetching and carrying endless unnecessary cushions and footstools ; while Argemone greeted him with a cold distant bow , and a fine - lady drawl of carefully commonplace congratulations . Her heart smote her though , as she saw the wan face and the wild , melancholy , moonstruck eyes once more glaring through and through her ; she found a comfort in thinking his stare impertinent , drew herself up , and turned away ; once , indeed , she could not help listening , as Lancelot thanked Mrs. Lavington for all the pious and edifying books with which the good lady had kept his room rather than his brain furnished for the last six weeks ; he was going to say more , but he saw the colonel ’s quaint foxy eye peering at him , remembered St. Francis de Sales , and held his tongue . But , as her destiny was , Argemone found herself , in the course of the evening , alone with Lancelot , at the open window . It was a still , hot , heavy night , after long easterly drought ; sheet - lightning glimmered on the far horizon over the dark woodlands ; the coming shower had sent forward as his herald a whispering draught of fragrant air . ‘
7837	7889	7943	7944	the giver	609	’ said Lancelot , half to himself . The expression struck Argemone : it was the right one , and it seemed to open vistas of feeling and observation in the speaker which she had not suspected . There was a rich melancholy in the voice;—she turned to look at him . ‘
7892	7897	7943	7944	the giver	609	’ he went on ; ‘
7955	7956	7946	7947	the receiver	610	’ ‘
7972	8040	7946	7947	the receiver	610	’ said Argemone , without knowing that she was speaking from her inmost heart : but thus does the soul involuntarily lay bare its most unspoken depths in the presence of its yet unknown mate , and then shudders at its own abandon as it first tries on the wedding garment of Paradise . Lancelot was not yet past the era at which young geniuses are apt to ‘
8043	8047	7946	7947	the receiver	610	’ at little . ‘
8051	8062	7946	7947	the receiver	610	’ he answered , flashing up according to his fashion . ‘
8105	8106	8109	8112	the founders of Babel	613	’ ‘
8114	8149	8109	8112	the founders of Babel	613	’ answered Argemone , carelessly , to this tirade . She had risen a strange fish , the cunning beauty , and now she was trying her fancy flies over him one by one . ‘
8157	8161	8152	8152	they	613	’ answered he . ‘
8297	8545	8547	8547	he	623	’ Lancelot had stuttered horribly during the latter part of this most heterodox outburst , for he had begun to think about himself , and try to say a fine thing , suspecting all the while that it might not be true . But Argemone did not remark the stammering : the new thoughts startled and pained her ; but there was a daring grace about them . She tried , as women will , to answer him with arguments , and failed , as women will fail . She was accustomed to lay down the law à la Madame de Staël , to savants and non - savants and be heard with reverence , as a woman should be . But poor truth - seeking Lancelot did not see what sex had to do with logic ; he flew at her as if she had been a very barrister , and hunted her mercilessly up and down through all sorts of charming sophisms , as she begged the question , and shifted her ground , as thoroughly right in her conclusion as she was wrong in her reasoning , till she grew quite confused and pettish.—And then Lancelot suddenly shrank into his shell , claws and all , like an affrighted soldier - crab , hung down his head , and stammered out some incoherencies,—‘N - n - not accustomed to talk to women — ladies , I mean . F - forgot myself.—Pray forgive me ! ’
8572	8579	8580	8580	she	624	‘ What have I to forgive ? ’
8597	8640	8580	8580	she	624	‘ You treat me like an equal ; you will deign to argue with me . But men in general — oh , they hide their contempt for us , if not their own ignorance , under that mask of chivalrous deference ! ’
8648	8698	8580	8580	she	624	’ key , which was her shell , as bitter brusquerie was his , she added , with an Amazon queen ’s toss of the head,—‘You must come and see us often . We shall suit each other , I see , better than most whom we see here . ’
8711	8722	8580	8580	she	624	‘ What , better than the glib Colonel Bracebridge yonder ? ’
8723	8774	8580	8580	she	624	‘ Oh , he is witty enough , but he lives on the surface of everything ! He is altogether shallow and blasé . His good - nature is the fruit of want of feeling ; between his gracefulness and his sneering persiflage he is a perfect Mephistopheles - Apollo . ’
9145	9416	9417	9417	she	637	’ peak Weltered in burning haze ; all airs were dead ; The sicale slept among the tamarisk ’s hair ; The birds sat dumb and drooping . Far below The lazy sea - weed glistened in the sun : The lazy sea - fowl dried their steaming wings ; The lazy swell crept whispering up the ledge , And sank again . Great Pan was laid to rest ; And mother Earth watched by him as he slept , And hushed her myriad children for awhile . She lay among the myrtles on the cliff ; And sighed for sleep , for sleep that would not hear , But left her tossing still : for night and day A mighty hunger yearned within her heart , Till all her veins ran fever , and her cheek , Her long thin hands , and ivory - channell’d feet , Were wasted with the wasting of her soul . Then peevishly she flung her on her face , And hid her eyeballs from the blinding glare , And fingered at the grass , and tried to cool Her crisp hot lips against the crisp hot sward : And then she raised her head , and upward cast Wild looks from homeless eyes , whose liquid light Gleamed out between deep folds of blue - black hair , As gleam twin lakes between the purple peaks Of deep Parnassus , at the mournful moon . Beside her lay a lyre . She snatched the shell , And waked wild music from its silver strings ; Then tossed it sadly by,—‘Ah , hush ! ’
9420	9438	9417	9417	she	637	‘ Dead offspring of the tortoise and the mine ! Why mock my discords with thine harmonies ? ‘
9465	9466	9417	9417	she	637	’ ‘
9469	9473	9417	9417	she	637	’ she said . ‘
9537	9628	9532	9532	I	0	’ Sweet self - deceiver ! had you no other reason for choosing as your heroine Sappho , the victim of the idolatry of intellect — trying in vain to fill her heart with the friendship of her own sex , and then sinking into mere passion for a handsome boy , and so down into self - contempt and suicide ? She was conscious , I do believe , of no other reason than that she gave ; but consciousness is a dim candle — over a deep mine . ‘
9632	9637	9638	9638	people	3181	’ she said pettishly , ‘
9700	9701	10388	10388	you	642	’ ‘
9718	9965	10388	10388	you	642	’ arose doleful through the echoing shrubbery . Argemone started and looked out . It was not a banshee , but a forgotten fox - hound puppy , sitting mournfully on the gravel - walk beneath , staring at the clear ghastly moon . She laughed and blushed — there was a rebuke in it . She turned to go to rest ; and as she knelt and prayed at her velvet faldstool , among all the nicknacks which now - a - days make a luxury of devotion , was it strange if , after she had prayed for the fate of nations and churches , and for those who , as she thought , were fighting at Oxford the cause of universal truth and reverend antiquity , she remembered in her petitions the poor godless youth , with his troubled and troubling eloquence ? But it was strange that she blushed when she mentioned his name — why should she not pray for him as she prayed for others ? Perhaps she felt that she did not pray for him as she prayed for others . She left the Æolian harp in the window , as a luxury if she should wake , and coiled herself up among lace pillows and eider blemos ; and the hound coiled himself up on the gravel - walk , after a solemn vesper - ceremony of three turns round in his own length , looking vainly for a ‘

And Argemone dreamed;—that she was a fox , flying for her life through a churchyard — and Lancelot was a hound , yelling and leaping , in a red coat and white buckskins , close upon her — and she felt his hot breath , and saw his white teeth glare ... And then her father was there : and he was an Italian boy , and played the organ — and Lancelot was a dancing dog , and stood up and danced to the tune of ‘

What the little imp , who managed this puppet - show on Argemone ’s brain - stage , may have intended to symbolise thereby , and whence he stole his actors and stage - properties , and whether he got up the interlude for his own private fun , or for that of a choir of brother Eulenspiegels , or , finally , for the edification of Argemone as to her own history , past , present , or future , are questions which we must leave unanswered , till physicians have become a little more of metaphysicians , and have given up their present plan of ignoring for nine hundred and ninety - nine pages that most awful and significant custom of dreaming , and then in the thousandth page talking the boldest materialist twaddle about it . In the meantime , Lancelot , contrary to the colonel ’s express commands , was sitting up to indite the following letter to his cousin , the Tractarian curate : — ‘

It might not do so to you ; but you are of a different constitution , and , from all I see , the power of a man ’s muscles , the excitability of his nerves , the shape and balance of his brain , make him what he is . Else what is the meaning of physiognomy ? Every man ’s destiny , as the Turks say , stands written on his forehead . One does not need two glances at your face to know that you would not enjoy fox - hunting , that you would enjoy book - learning and “ refined repose , ” as they are pleased to call it . Every man carries his character in his brain . You all know that , and act upon it when you have to deal with a man for sixpence ; but your religious dogmas , which make out that everyman comes into the world equally brutish and fiendish , make you afraid to confess it . I do n’t quarrel with a “ douce ” man like you , with a large organ of veneration , for following your bent . But if I am fiery , with a huge cerebellum , why am I not to follow mine?—For that is what you do , after all — what you like best . It is all very easy for a man to talk of conquering his appetites , when he has none to conquer . Try and conquer your organ of veneration , or of benevolence , or of calculation — then I will call you an ascetic . Why not!—The same Power which made the front of one ’s head made the back , I suppose ? ‘
11103	11265	11100	11101	poor souls	661	‘ But you must explain to us naughty fox - hunters how all this agrees with the good book . We see plainly enough , in the meantime , how it agrees with “ poor human nature . ” We see that the “ religious world , ” like the “ great world , ” and the “ sporting world , ” and the “ literary world , ” “ Compounds for sins she is inclined to , By damning those she has no mind to ; ” and that because England is a money - making country , and money - making is an effeminate pursuit , therefore all sedentary and spoony sins , like covetousness , slander , bigotry , and self - conceit , are to be cockered and plastered over , while the more masculine vices , and no - vices also , are mercilessly hunted down by your cold - blooded , soft - handed religionists . ‘
11384	11727	11372	11372	you	663	‘ By the bye , my dear fellow , was I asleep or awake when I seemed to read in the postscript of your last letter , something about “ being driven to Rome after all ” ? ... Why thither , of all places in heaven or earth ? You know , I have no party interest in the question . All creeds are very much alike to me just now . But allow me to ask , in a spirit of the most tolerant curiosity , what possible celestial bait , either of the useful or the agreeable kind , can the present excellent Pope , or his adherents , hold out to you in compensation for the solid earthly pudding which you would have to desert ? ... I daresay , though , that I shall not comprehend your answer when it comes . I am , you know , utterly deficient in that sixth sense of the angelic or supralunar beautiful , which fills your soul with ecstasy . You , I know , expect and long to become an angel after death : I am under the strange hallucination that my body is part of me , and in spite of old Plotinus , look with horror at a disembodiment till the giving of that new body , the great perfection of which , in your eyes , and those of every one else , seems to be , that it will be less , and not more of a body , than our present one ... Is this hope , to me at once inconceivable and contradictory , palpable and valuable enough to you to send you to that Italian Avernus , to get it made a little more certain ? If so , I despair of your making your meaning intelligible to a poor fellow wallowing , like me , in the Hylic Borboros — or whatever else you may choose to call the unfortunate fact of being flesh and blood ...

What would have been Tregarva ’s answer , I can not tell ; but Lancelot , who had unintentionally overheard the greater part of the conversation , disliked being any longer a listener , and came close to them . ‘

15110	15142	15144	15144	Lancelot	172	‘ But why , in God ’s name , do n’t they strike at the root of the matter , and go straight to the landlords and tell them the truth ? ’
15146	15203	15144	15144	Lancelot	172	‘ So people say , sir . I see no reason for it except the one which I gave you . Besides , sir , you must remember , that a man ca n’t quarrel with his own kin ; and so many of them are their squire ’s brothers , or sons , or nephews . ’

15215	15295	15043	15043	Tregarva	173	‘ Ay , sir , and , to do them justice , they had need , for the poor ’s sake , to keep good friends with the squire . How else are they to get a farthing for schools , or coal - subscriptions , or lying - in societies , or lending libraries , or penny clubs ? If they spoke their minds to the great ones , sir , how could they keep the parish together ? ’
15296	15344	15144	15144	Lancelot	172	‘ You seem to see both sides of a question , certainly . But what a miserable state of things , that the labouring man should require all these societies , and charities , and helps from the rich!—that an industrious freeman can not live without alms ! ’

15880	15911	15872	15872	he	445	’ answered Tregarva , in his usual staid tone . There was a pause . The keeper looked at him with a glance , before which Lancelot ’s eyes fell . ‘

Lancelot sat and tried to catch perch , but Tregarva ’s words haunted him . He lighted his cigar , and tried to think earnestly over the matter , but he had got into the wrong place for thinking . All his thoughts , all his sympathies , were drowned in the rush and whirl of the water . He forgot everything else in the mere animal enjoyment of sight and sound . Like many young men at his crisis of life , he had given himself up to the mere contemplation of Nature till he had become her slave ; and now a luscious scene , a singing bird , were enough to allure his mind away from the most earnest and awful thoughts . He tried to think , but the river would not let him . It thundered and spouted out behind him from the hatches , and leapt madly past him , and caught his eyes in spite of him , and swept them away down its dancing waves , and let them go again only to sweep them down again and again , till his brain felt a delicious dizziness from the everlasting rush and the everlasting roar . And then below , how it spread , and writhed , and whirled into transparent fans , hissing and twining snakes , polished glass - wreaths , huge crystal bells , which boiled up from the bottom , and dived again beneath long threads of creamy foam , and swung round posts and roots , and rushed blackening under dark weed - fringed boughs , and gnawed at the marly banks , and shook the ever - restless bulrushes , till it was swept away and down over the white pebbles and olive weeds , in one broad rippling sheet of molten silver , towards the distant sea . Downwards it fleeted ever , and bore his thoughts floating on its oily stream ; and the great trout , with their yellow sides and peacock backs , lounged among the eddies , and the silver grayling dimpled and wandered upon the shallows , and the may - flies flickered and rustled round him like water fairies , with their green gauzy wings ; the coot clanked musically among the reeds ; the frogs hummed their ceaseless vesper - monotone ; the kingfisher darted from his hole in the bank like a blue spark of electric light ; the swallows ’

16658	16691	16655	16655	Lancelot	172	‘ Come out to me , and if you stumble , the naiads will rise out of their depths , and “ hold up their pearled wrists ” to save their favourite . ’
16715	16758	16705	16705	Lancelot	172	‘ Welcome , Claude Mellot , and all lovely enthusiasms and symbolisms ! Expound to me , now , the meaning of that water - lily leaf and its grand simple curve , as it lies sleeping there in the back eddy . ’
16759	16791	16705	16705	Lancelot	172	‘ Oh , I am too amused to philosophise . The fair Argemone has just been treating me to her three hundred and sixty - fifth philippic against my unoffending beard . ’
16792	16808	16692	16693	The artist	3180	‘ Why , what fault can she find with such a graceful and natural ornament ? ’
16809	16934	16705	16705	Lancelot	172	‘ Just this , my dear fellow , that it is natural . As it is , she considers me only “ intelligent - looking . ” If the beard were away , my face , she says , would be “ so refined ! ” And , I suppose , if I was just a little more effeminate and pale , with a nice retreating under - jaw and a drooping lip , and a meek , peaking simper , like your starved Romish saints , I should be “ so spiritual ! ” And if , again , to complete the climax , I did but shave my head like a Chinese , I should be a model for St. Francis himself ! ’
16935	16952	16705	16705	Lancelot	172	‘ But really , after all , why make yourself so singular by this said beard ? ’
16953	17101	16705	16705	Lancelot	172	‘ I wear it for a testimony and a sign that a man has no right to be ashamed of the mark of manhood . Oh , that one or two of your Protestant clergymen , who ought to be perfect ideal men , would have the courage to get up into the pulpit in a long beard , and testify that the very essential idea of Protestantism is the dignity and divinity of man as God made him ! Our forefathers were not ashamed of their beards ; but now even the soldier is only allowed to keep his moustache , while our quill - driving masses shave themselves as close as they can ; and in proportion to a man ’s piety he wears less hair , from the young curate who shaves off his whiskers , to the Popish priest who shaves his crown ! ’

17802	17809	17810	17811	Fairly caught	854	’ cried Argemone from the bridge . ‘
17813	17817	17810	17811	Fairly caught	854	’ grumbled Lancelot . ‘
17834	17985	17986	17986	I	0	’ The two ladies were accompanied by Bracebridge , a gazelle which he had given Argemone , and a certain miserable cur of Honoria ’s adopting , who plays an important part in this story , and , therefore , deserves a little notice . Honoria had rescued him from a watery death in the village pond , by means of the colonel , who had revenged himself for a pair of wet feet by utterly corrupting the dog ’s morals , and teaching him every week to answer to some fresh scandalous name . But Lancelot was not to escape . Instead of moving on , as he had hoped , the party stood looking over the bridge , and talking — he took for granted , poor thin - skinned fellow — of him . And for once his suspicions were right ; for he overheard Argemone say — ‘
18024	18025	18027	18027	you	856	’ ‘
18029	18042	18027	18027	you	856	’ said the colonel , with a low bow . Lancelot rose . ‘
18056	18062	18044	18046	a country girl	857	’ said he to himself , ‘
18102	18149	18083	18083	I	0	’ She drew him away , as women only know how , from the rest of the party , who were chatting and laughing with Claude . She had shown off her fancied indifference to Lancelot before them , and now began in a softer voice — ‘
18162	18163	18159	18160	Mr. Smith	137	’ ‘
18173	18174	18165	18165	I	0	’ ‘

18270	18275	18265	18265	you	0	’ she said gently , ‘
18305	18310	18302	18303	One above	860	’ Lancelot understood her . ‘

18345	18362	18316	18316	I	0	’ Argemone really could not tell at the moment . The answer upset her scheme entirely . ‘
18377	18382	18316	18316	I	0	’ continued our hero . ‘
18397	18398	18316	18316	I	0	’ ‘
18401	18406	18316	18316	I	0	’ sighed the lady , ‘
18439	18440	18444	18445	Miss Lavington	189	’ ‘
18447	18502	18444	18445	Miss Lavington	189	’ Argemone hesitated . She had made the good old stock assertion , as in duty bound ; but she could not help recollecting that there were several Popish books of devotion at that moment on her table , which seemed to her to patch a gap or two in the Prayer - book . ‘
18508	18512	18521	18521	my	0	’ said Lancelot , ‘
18686	18724	18727	18728	Mr. Smith	137	’ Argemone tried to look very much shocked at this piece of bombast . Lancelot evidently meant it as such , but he eyed her all the while as if there was solemn earnest under the surface . ‘
18730	18734	18727	18728	Mr. Smith	137	’ she said , ‘
18769	18770	18756	18756	You	137	’ ‘
18790	18791	18756	18756	You	137	’ ‘
18794	18799	18756	18756	You	137	’ she said hopefully , ‘

18855	18856	18850	18850	you	137	’ ‘

19385	19603	19379	19379	her	863	’ Argemone was angry and disappointed . She felt she could not cope with Lancelot ’s quaint logic , which , however unsound , cut deeper into questions than she had yet looked for herself . Somehow , too , she was tongue - tied before him just when she wanted to be most eloquent in behalf of her principles ; and that fretted her still more . But his manner puzzled her most of all . First he would run on with his face turned away , as if soliloquising out into the air , and then suddenly look round at her with most fascinating humility ; and , then , in a moment , a dark shade would pass over his countenance , and he would look like one possessed , and his lips wreathe in a sinister artificial smile , and his wild eyes glare through and through her with such cunning understanding of himself and her , that , for the first time in her life , she quailed and felt frightened , as if in the power of a madman . She turned hastily away to shake off the spell . He sprang after her , almost on his knees , and looked up into her beautiful face with an imploring cry . ‘
19685	19691	19640	19641	a man?—because	897	’ She paused , astonished . ‘
19696	19701	19640	19641	a man?—because	897	’ he went on , ‘
19973	19974	19964	19964	you	893	’ ‘
19985	19992	19977	19977	you	893	’ asked Argemone , half terrified . ‘

20109	20113	20116	20117	fairest prophetess	913	’ Lancelot laughed . ‘
20167	20172	20191	20191	you	189	’ Argemone began , — ‘
20176	20177	20191	20191	you	189	’ ‘
20183	20189	20191	20191	you	189	’ cried he , impatiently , ‘

20356	20361	20351	20351	Our	918	’ said Argemone drily . ‘
20448	20482	20443	20446	Protestant - Manichee Taylor	201	’ It was lucky for the life of young Love that the discussion went no further : Argemone was becoming scandalised beyond all measure . But , happily , the colonel interposed , — ‘
20498	20499	20502	20503	the keeper	3350	’ ‘
20509	20516	20500	20500	Tregarva	173	’ answered they both at once . ‘
20523	20524	20502	20503	the keeper	3350	’ ‘
20527	20531	20502	20503	the keeper	3350	’ said Lancelot . ‘

20564	20568	20557	20557	you	189	’ interposed Honoria , ‘

20720	20725	20714	20714	he	182	’ said Honoria eagerly . ‘

20792	20803	20804	20804	Bravo	203	’ Claude Mellot clapped his white woman - like hands . ‘
20854	20855	20858	20859	Mr. Mellot	204	’ ‘
20861	20865	20858	20859	Mr. Mellot	204	’ said Honoria , ‘

20969	20970	20964	20964	God	281	’ ‘
20973	20979	20964	20964	God	281	’ cried Lancelot , laughing . ‘
21047	21048	21042	21042	Norse	205	’ ‘
21062	21063	21064	21064	I	0	’ ‘
21163	21196	21154	21156	Von Troneg Hagen	207	’ He turned : Honoria was devouring his words . He saw it , for he was in love , and young love makes man ’s senses as keen as woman ’s . ‘
21204	21213	21154	21156	Von Troneg Hagen	207	’ said Claude , in a low voice . ‘
21249	21250	21244	21247	some dumb granite Memnon	948	’ ‘
21254	21258	21244	21247	some dumb granite Memnon	948	’ said Lancelot , ‘
21274	21330	21244	21247	some dumb granite Memnon	948	’ He looked at Honoria as he spoke . She blushed angrily ; and yet a sort of sympathy arose from that moment between Lancelot and herself . Our hero feared he had gone too far , and tried to turn the subject off . The smooth mill - head was alive with rising trout . ‘
21338	21343	21244	21247	some dumb granite Memnon	948	’ said Lancelot carelessly ; ‘
21352	21363	21369	21370	my dog	950	’ Honoria looked round , and uttered a piercing scream . ‘
21392	21456	21457	21457	He	208	’ Alas ! it was too true . There , a yard above the one open hatchway , through which the whole force of the stream was rushing , was the unhappy Mops , alias Scratch , alias Dirty Dick , alias Jack Sheppard , paddling , and sneezing , and winking , his little bald muzzle turned piteously upward to the sky . ‘
21462	21567	21457	21457	He	208	’ quoth the colonel . There was no doubt of it ; and so Mops thought , as , shivering and whining , he plied every leg , while the glassy current dragged him back and back , and Honoria sobbed like a child . The colonel lay down on the bridge , and caught at him : his arm was a foot too short . In a moment the huge form of Tregarva plunged solemnly into the water , with a splash like seven salmon , and Mops was jerked out over the colonel ’s head high and dry on to the bridge . ‘
21576	21698	21568	21568	You	208	’ shouted the colonel , with an oath of Uncle Toby ’s own . Tregarva saw his danger , made one desperate bound upward , and missed the bridge . The colonel caught at him , tore off a piece of his collar — the calm , solemn face of the keeper flashed past beneath him , and disappeared through the roaring gate . They rushed to the other side of the bridge — caught one glimpse of a dark body fleeting and roaring down the foam - way . The colonel leapt the bridge - rail like a deer , rushed out along the buck - stage , tore off his coat , and sprung headlong into the boiling pool , ‘
21704	21733	21568	21568	You	208	’ as old Homer would say . Lancelot , forgetting his crutches , was dashing after him , when he felt a soft hand clutching at his arm . ‘
21739	21743	21736	21737	Mr. Smith	137	’ cried Argemone . ‘
21756	21757	21749	21749	You	172	’ ‘
21765	21766	21749	21749	You	172	’ ‘
21774	21790	21749	21749	You	172	’ she cried , in a tone of deep passion . And then , imperiously , ‘
21798	21827	21794	21794	I	0	’ The magnetic touch of her hand thrilled through his whole frame . She had called him Lancelot ! He shrank down , and stood spell - bound . ‘
21831	21835	21794	21794	I	0	’ she cried ; ‘
21841	21919	21794	21794	I	0	’ Out on the extremity of the buck - stage ( how she got there neither they nor she ever knew ) crouched Honoria , her face idiotic with terror , while she stared with bursting eyes into the foam . A shriek of disappointment rose from her lips , as in a moment the colonel ’s weather - worn head reappeared above , looking for all the world like an old gray shiny - painted seal . ‘
21942	22185	21937	21937	Lancelot	172	’ And he disappeared again . They looked round , there was not a loose bit near . Claude ran off towards the house . Lancelot , desperate , seized the bridge - rail , tore it off by sheer strength , and hurled it far into the pool . Argemone saw it , and remembered it , like a true woman . Ay , be as Manichæan - sentimental as you will , fair ladies , physical prowess , that Eden - right of manhood , is sure to tell upon your hearts ! Again the colonel ’s grizzled head reappeared,—and , oh joy ! beneath it a draggled knot of black curls . In another instant he had hold of the rail , and quietly floating down to the shallow , dragged the lifeless giant high and dry on a patch of gravel . Honoria never spoke . She rose , walked quietly back along the beam , passed Argemone and Lancelot without seeing them , and firmly but hurriedly led the way round the pool - side . Before they arrived at the bank , the colonel had carried Tregarva to it . Lancelot and two or three workmen , whom his cries had attracted , lifted the body on to the meadow . Honoria knelt quietly down on the grass , and watched , silent and motionless , the dead face , with her wide , awestruck eyes . ‘
22194	22211	22186	22186	God	281	’ whispered the wan weather - beaten field drudges , as they crowded round the body . ‘
22221	22226	22186	22186	God	281	’ quoth the colonel . ‘
22234	22335	22186	22186	God	281	’ And he packed off one here and another there for necessaries , and commenced trying every restorative means with the ready coolness of a practised surgeon ; while Lancelot , whom he ordered about like a baby , gulped down a great choking lump of envy , and then tasted the rich delight of forgetting himself in admiring obedience to a real superior . But there Tregarva lay lifeless , with folded hands , and a quiet satisfied smile , while Honoria watched and watched with parted lips , unconscious of the presence of every one . Five minutes!—ten ! ‘
22342	22356	22357	22357	He	957	’ said the colonel , in a despairing tone , after another attempt . ‘
22360	22361	22357	22357	He	957	’ ‘
22364	22365	22366	22366	He	957	’ ‘
22369	22370	22366	22366	He	957	’ ‘
22374	22375	22366	22366	He	957	’ ‘
22381	22387	22366	22366	He	957	’ Slowly his eyes opened . ‘
22401	22541	22366	22366	He	957	’ His eye met Honoria ’s . One big deep sigh swelled to his lips and burst . She seemed to recollect herself , rose , passed her arm through Argemone ’s , and walked slowly away . Argemone , sweet prude , thought herself bound to read Honoria a lecture that night , on her reckless exhibition of feeling ; but it profited little . The most consummate cunning could not have baffled Argemone ’s suspicions more completely than her sister ’s utter simplicity . She cried just as bitterly about Mops ’s danger as about the keeper ’s , and then laughed heartily at Argemone ’s solemnity ; till at last , when pushed a little too hard , she broke out into something very like a passion , and told her sister , bitterly enough , that ‘
22563	22817	22542	22542	she	960	’ Whereat Argemone prudently held her tongue , knowing that under all Honoria ’s tenderness lay a volcano of passionate determination , which was generally kept down by her affections , but was just as likely to be maddened by them . And so this conversation only went to increase the unconscious estrangement between them , though they continued , as sisters will do , to lavish upon each other the most extravagant protestations of affection — vowing to live and die only for each other — and believing honestly , sweet souls , that they felt all they said ; till real imperious Love came in , in one case of the two at least , shouldering all other affections right and left ; and then the two beauties discovered , as others do , that it is not so possible or reasonable as they thought for a woman to sacrifice herself and her lover for the sake of her sister or her friend . Next morning Lancelot and the colonel started out to Tregarva ’s cottage , on a mission of inquiry . They found the giant propped up in bed with pillows , his magnificent features looking in their paleness more than ever like a granite Memnon . Before him lay an open Pilgrim ’s Progress , and a drawer filled with feathers and furs , which he was busily manufacturing into trout flies , reading as he worked . The room was filled with nets , guns , and keepers ’
22833	22840	22841	22841	he	962	‘ Excuse my rising , gentlemen , ’
22851	22881	22841	22841	he	962	‘ but I am very weak , in spite of the Lord ’s goodness to me . You are very kind to think of coming to my poor cottage , ’
22882	22888	22890	22891	the colonel	504	‘ Well , my man , ’
22893	22912	22841	22841	he	962	‘ and how are you after your cold bath ? You are the heaviest fish I ever landed ! ’
22913	22945	22841	22841	he	962	‘ Pretty well , thank God , and you , sir . I am in your debt , sir , for the dear life . How shall I ever repay you ? ’
22946	22962	22841	22841	he	962	‘ Repay , my good fellow ? You would have done as much for me . ’
22963	23041	22841	22841	he	962	‘ May be ; but you did not think of that when you jumped in ; and no more must I in thanking you . God knows how a poor miner ’s son will ever reward you ; but the mouse repaid the lion , says the story , and , at all events , I can pray for you . By the bye , gentlemen , I hope you have brought up some trolling - tackle ? ’
23042	23055	23057	23057	Lancelot	172	‘ We came up to see you , and not to fish , ’
23068	23155	23156	23156	Lancelot	172	‘ Many thanks , gentlemen ; but old Harry Verney was in here just now , and had seen a great jack strike , at the tail of the lower reeds . With this fresh wind he will run till noon ; and you are sure of him with a dace . After that , he will not be up again on the shallows till sunset . He works the works of darkness , and comes not to the light , because his deeds are evil . ’
23159	23170	23156	23156	Lancelot	172	‘ He does but follow his kind , poor fellow . ’
23171	23248	23292	23292	you	965	‘ No doubt , sir , no doubt ; all the Lord ’s works are good : but it is a wonder why He should have made wasps , now , and blights , and vermin , and jack , and such evil - featured things , that carry spite and cruelty in their very faces — a great wonder . Do you think , sir , all those creatures were in the Garden of Eden ? ’
23249	23258	23260	23260	Lancelot	172	‘ You are getting too deep for me , ’
23262	23271	23260	23260	Lancelot	172	‘ But why trouble your head about fishing ? ’
23272	23285	23292	23292	you	965	‘ I beg your pardon for preaching to you , sir . I ’m

23617	23625	23614	23615	the colonel	504	‘ You can make salmon - flies ? ’
23626	23640	23599	23600	the giant	3364	‘ I made a lot by pattern for an Irish gent , sir . ’
23641	23663	23614	23615	the colonel	504	‘ Well , then , we ’ll send you some Norway patterns , and some golden pheasant and parrot feathers . We ’re

23994	23995	23987	23987	I	0	’ ‘

24367	24389	24392	24392	you	753	’ Lancelot , quite unaccustomed to the language of the Dissenting poor , felt keenly the bad taste of the allusion . ‘
24395	24399	24392	24392	you	753	’ he asked . ‘

24607	24709	24602	24602	God	281	’m wrong ! but I sometimes think that there must be more good in that human wisdom , and philosophy falsely so called , than we Wesleyans hold . Oh , sir , what a blessing is a good education ! What you gentlemen might do with it , if you did but see your own power ! Are there no fish in England , sir , to be caught ? precious fish , with immortal souls ? And is there not One who has said , “ Come with me , and I will make you fishers of men ? ” ’
24710	24719	24602	24602	God	281	‘ Would you have us all turn parsons ? ’

Such a man as Colonel Bracebridge now , with the tongue of the serpent , who can charm any living soul he likes to his will , as a stoat charms a rabbit . Or you , sir , with your tongue:—you have charmed one precious creature already . I can see it : though neither of you know it , yet I know it . ’
24829	24840	24822	24822	Lancelot	172	‘ Oh , that I had your tongue , sir ! ’
24855	24877	24842	24843	the keeper	3350	‘ But why could you not charm all alike ! Do not the poor want you as well as the rich ? ’
24878	24917	24918	24919	The keeper	3350	‘ What can I do for the poor , my good fellow ? And what do they want ? Have they not houses , work , a church , and schools,—and poor - rates to fall back on ? ’
24923	24958	24918	24919	The keeper	3350	‘ To fall back on , indeed ! and down on , too . At all events , you rich might help to make Christians of them , and men of them . For I ’m

25164	25173	25160	25160	Lancelot	172	‘ Are the poor very immoral , then ? ’
25174	25272	25147	25148	the keeper	3350	‘ You ask the rector , sir , how many children hereabouts are born within six months of the wedding - day . None of them marry , sir , till the devil forces them . There ’s no sadder sight than a labourer ’s wedding now - a - days . You never see the parents come with them . They just get another couple , that are keeping company , like themselves , and come sneaking into church , looking all over as if they were ashamed of it — and well they may be ! ’
25273	25278	25160	25160	Lancelot	172	‘ Is it possible ? ’
25279	25383	25147	25148	the keeper	3350	‘ I say , sir , that God makes you gentlemen , gentlemen , that you may see into these things . You give away your charities kindly enough , but you do n’t know the folks you give to . If a few of you would but be like the blessed Lord , and stoop to go out of the road , just behind the hedge , for once , among the publicans and harlots ! Were you ever at a country fair , sir ? Though I suppose I am rude for fancying that you could demean yourself to such company . ’
25384	25393	25395	25395	Lancelot	172	‘ I should not think it demeaning myself , ’
25399	25422	25395	25395	Lancelot	172	‘ but I never was at one , and I should like for once to see the real manners of the poor . ’

25466	25472	25395	25395	Lancelot	172	‘ I shall be delighted . ’
25473	25485	25147	25148	the keeper	3350	‘ Not after you ’ve been there , I am afraid . ’
25486	25537	25147	25148	the keeper	3350	‘ Well , it ’s a bargain when you are recovered . And , in the meantime , the squire ’s orders are , that you lie by for a few days to rest ; and Miss Honoria ’s , too ; and she has sent you down some wine . ’
25538	25547	25147	25148	the keeper	3350	‘ She thought of me , did she ? ’
25617	25644	25611	25611	he	3350	‘ Through strange ways — strange ways — and though he let them wander out of the road in the wilderness;—we know how that goes on — ’
25686	25911	25679	25679	I	0	‘ You are not fair to me , good cousin ... but I have given up expecting fairness from Protestants . I do not say that the front and the back of my head have different makers , any more than that doves and vipers have ... and yet I kill the viper when I meet him ... and so do you ... And yet , are we not taught that our animal nature is throughout equally viperous ? ... The Catholic Church , at least , so teaches ... She believes in the corruption of human nature . She believes in the literal meaning of Scripture . She has no wish to paraphrase away St. Paul ’s awful words , that “ in his flesh dwelleth no good thing , ” by the unscientific euphemisms of “ fallen nature ” or “ corrupt humanity . ” The boasted discovery of phrenologists , that thought , feeling , and passion reside in this material brain and nerves of ours , has ages ago been anticipated by her simple faith in the letter of Scripture ; a faith which puts to shame the irreverent vagueness and fantastic private interpretations of those who make an idol of that very letter which they dare not take literally , because it makes against their self - willed theories ... ‘
26680	27282	26667	26667	you	1084	‘ And then I went to another school ... or rather wandered up and down between those whom I have just described , and those who boast on their side prescriptive right , and apostolic succession ... and I found that their ancient charter went back — just three hundred years ... and there derived its transmitted virtue , it seemed to me , by something very like obtaining goods on false pretences , from the very church which it now anathematises . Disheartened , but not hopeless , I asked how it was that the priesthood , whose hands bestowed the grace of ordination , could not withdraw it ... whether , at least , the schismatic did not forfeit it by the very act of schism ... and instead of any real answer to that fearful spiritual dilemma , they set me down to folios of Nag ’s head controversies ... and myths of an independent British Church , now represented , strangely enough , by those Saxons who , after its wicked refusal to communicate with them , exterminated it with fire and sword , and derived its own order from St. Gregory ... and decisions of mythical old councils ( held by bishops of a different faith and practice from their own ) , from which I was to pick the one point which made for them , and omit the nine which made against them , while I was to believe , by a stretch of imagination ... or common honesty ... , which I leave you to conceive , that the Church of Syria in the fourth century was , in doctrine , practice , and constitution , like that of England in the nineteenth ? ... And what was I to gain by all this ? ... For the sake of what was I to strain logic and conscience ? To believe myself a member of the same body with all the Christian nations of the earth?—to be able to hail the Frenchman , the Italian , the Spaniard , as a brother — to have hopes even of the German and the Swede ... if not in this life , still in the life to come ? No ... to be able still to sit apart from all Christendom in the exclusive pride of insular Pharisaism ; to claim for the modern littleness of England the infallibility which I denied to the primæval mother of Christendom , not to enlarge my communion to the Catholic , but excommunicate , to all practical purposes , over and above the Catholics , all other Protestants except my own sect ... or rather , in practice , except my own party in my own sect ... And this was believing in one Catholic and Apostolic church ! ... this was to be my share of the communion of saints ! And these were the theories which were to satisfy a soul which longed for a kingdom of God on earth , which felt that unless the highest of His promises are a mythic dream , there must be some system on the earth commissioned to fulfil those promises ; some authority divinely appointed to regenerate , and rule , and guide the lives of men , and the destinies of nations ; who must go mad , unless he finds that history is not a dreary aimless procession of lost spirits descending into the pit , or that the salvation of millions does not depend on an obscure and controverted hair ’s breadth of ecclesiastic law . ‘
27599	27714	27717	27717	I	0	‘ How can I turn away from such a voice ? What if some of her doctrines may startle my untutored and ignorant understanding ? ... If she is the appointed teacher , she will know best what truths to teach ... The disciple is not above his master ... or wise in requiring him to demonstrate the abstrusest problems ... spiritual problems , too ... before he allows his right to teach the elements . Humbly I must enter the temple porch ; gradually and trustfully proceed with my initiation ... When that is past , and not before ... shall I be a fit judge of the mysteries of the inner shrine . ‘
27781	27796	27777	27779	your unhappy Cousin	1107	’ And Lancelot did consider that letter , and answered it as follows : — ‘
29242	29952	29236	29240	the Ordering and Creating God	1186	’ Which of them do you think , reader , had most right on his side ? Lancelot was now so far improved in health as to return to his little cottage ornée . He gave himself up freely to his new passion . With his comfortable fortune and good connections , the future seemed bright and possible enough as to circumstances . He knew that Argemone felt for him ; how much it seemed presumptuous even to speculate , and as yet no golden - visaged meteor had arisen portentous in his amatory zodiac . No rich man had stepped in to snatch , in spite of all his own flocks and herds , at the poor man ’s own ewe - lamb , and set him barking at all the world , as many a poor lover has to do in defence of his morsel of enjoyment , now turned into a mere bone of contention and loadstone for all hungry kites and crows . All that had to be done was to render himself worthy of her , and in doing so , to win her . And now he began to feel more painfully his ignorance of society , of practical life , and the outward present . He blamed himself angrily for having , as he now thought , wasted his time on ancient histories and foreign travels , while he neglected the living wonderful present , which weltered daily round him , every face embodying a living soul . For now he began to feel that those faces did hide living souls ; formerly he had half believed — he had tried , but from laziness , to make himself wholly believe — that they were all empty masks , phantasies , without interest or significance for him . But , somehow , in the light of his new love for Argemone , the whole human race seemed glorified , brought nearer , endeared to him . So it must be . He had spoken of a law wider than he thought in his fancy , that the angels might learn love for all by love for an individual . Do we not all learn love so ? Is it not the first touch of the mother ’s bosom which awakens in the infant ’s heart that spark of affection which is hereafter to spread itself out towards every human being , and to lose none of its devotion for its first object , as it expands itself to innumerable new ones ? Is it not by love , too — by looking into loving human eyes , by feeling the care of loving hands,—that the infant first learns that there exist other beings beside itself?—that every body which it sees expresses a heart and will like its own ? Be sure of it . Be sure that to have found the key to one heart is to have found the key to all ; that truly to love is truly to know ; and truly to love one , is the first step towards truly loving all who bear the same flesh and blood with the beloved . Like children , we must dress up even our unseen future in stage properties borrowed from the tried and palpable present , ere we can look at it without horror . We fear and hate the utterly unknown , and it only . Even pain we hate only when we can not know it ; when we can only feel it , without explaining it , and making it harmonise with our notions of our own deserts and destiny . And as for human beings , there surely it stands true , wherever else it may not , that all knowledge is love , and all love knowledge ; that even with the meanest , we can not gain a glimpse into their inward trials and struggles , without an increase of sympathy and affection . Whether he reasoned thus or not , Lancelot found that his new interest in the working classes was strangely quickened by his passion . It seemed the shortest and clearest way toward a practical knowledge of the present . ‘
29955	29961	29236	29240	the Ordering and Creating God	1186	’ he said to himself , ‘
29993	30215	30244	30244	they	1035	’ The inquiry had not yet presented itself to him as a duty ; perhaps so much the better , that it might be the more thoroughly a free - will offering of love . At least it opened a new field of amusement and knowledge ; it promised him new studies of human life ; and as he lay on his sofa and let his thoughts flow , Tregarva ’s dark revelations began to mix themselves with dreams about the regeneration of the Whitford poor , and those again with dreams about the heiress of Whitford ; and many a luscious scene and noble plan rose brightly detailed in his exuberant imagination . For Lancelot , like all born artists , could only think in a concrete form . He never worked out a subject without embodying it in some set oration , dialogue , or dramatic castle in the air . But the more he dreamt , the more he felt that a material beauty of flesh and blood required a material house , baths , and boudoirs , conservatories , and carriages ; a safe material purse , and fixed material society ; law and order , and the established frame - work of society , gained an importance in his eyes which they had never had before . ‘
30218	30224	30244	30244	they	1035	’ he said to himself , ‘
30265	30266	30244	30244	they	1035	’ ‘
30319	30357	30358	30358	He	0	‘ When his regard Was raised by intense pensiveness , two eyes , Two starry eyes , hung in the gloom of thought , And seemed , with their serene and azure smiles , To beckon him . ’

30420	30423	30424	30424	he	0	‘ Well , ’
30435	30533	30424	30424	he	0	‘ I suppose it is good for us easy - going ones now and then to face the possibility of a change . Gold has grown on my back as feathers do on geese , without my own will or deed ; but considering that gold , like feathers , is equally useful to those who have and those who have not , why , it is worth while for the goose to remember that he may possibly one day be plucked . And what remains ? “ Io , ” as Medea says ... But Argemone ? ’

30678	30728	30932	30933	the Man	738	‘ Over head and ears in Young England , till I fled to you for a week ’s common sense . A glass of cider , for mercy ’s sake , “ to take the taste of it out of my mouth , ” as Bill Sykes has it . ’
30729	30736	30932	30933	the Man	738	‘ Where have you been staying ? ’
30737	30792	30617	30617	he	172	‘ With young Lord Vieuxbois , among high art and painted glass , spade farms , and model smell - traps , rubricalities and sanitary reforms , and all other inventions , possible and impossible , for “ stretching the old formula to meet the new fact , ” as your favourite prophet says . ’
30793	30803	30932	30933	the Man	738	‘ Till the old formula cracks under the tension . ’
30804	30820	30932	30933	the Man	738	‘ And cracks its devotees , too , I think . Here comes the cider ! ’
30821	30912	30617	30617	he	172	‘ But , my dear fellow , you must not laugh at all this . Young England or Peelite , this is all right and noble . What a yet unspoken poetry there is in that very sanitary reform ! It is the great fact of the age . We shall have men arise and write epics on it , when they have learnt that “ to the pure all things are pure , ” and that science and usefulness contain a divine element , even in their lowest appliances . ’
30913	30924	30932	30933	the Man	738	‘ Write one yourself , and call it the Chadwickiad . ’

31087	31201	31622	31623	The colonel	504	‘ Savoir faire , O infant Hercules ! own daddy to savoir vivre . I am a good listener ; and , therefore , the most perfect , because the most silent , of flatterers . When they talk Puginesquery , I stick my head on one side attentively , and “ think the more , ” like the lady ’s parrot . I have been all the morning looking over a set of drawings for my lord ’s new chapel ; and every soul in the party fancies me a great antiquary , just because I have been retailing to B as my own everything that A told me the moment before . ’
31202	31213	31056	31056	Lancelot	172	‘ I envy you your tact , at all events . ’
31214	31290	31056	31056	Lancelot	172	‘ Why the deuce should you ? You may rise in time to something better than tact ; to what the good book , I suppose , means by “ wisdom . ” Young geniuses like you , who have been green enough to sell your souls to “ truth , ” must not meddle with tact , unless you wish to fare as the donkey did when he tried to play lap - dog . ’
31291	31317	31319	31319	Lancelot	172	‘ At all events , I would sooner remain cub till they run me down and eat me , than give up speaking my mind , ’
31321	31337	31319	31319	Lancelot	172	‘ Fool I may be , but the devil himself sha n’t make me knave . ’
31338	31411	31056	31056	Lancelot	172	‘ Quite proper . On two thousand a year a man can afford to be honest . Kick out lustily right and left!—After all , the world is like a spaniel ; the more you beat it , the better it likes you — if you have money . Only do n’t kick too hard ; for , after all , it has a hundred million pair of shins to your one . ’
31412	31498	31056	31056	Lancelot	172	‘ Do n’t fear that I shall run a - muck against society just now . I am too thoroughly out of my own good books . I have been for years laughing at Young England , and yet its little finger is thicker than my whole body , for it is trying to do something ; and I , alas , am doing utterly nothing . I should be really glad to take a lesson of these men and their plans for social improvement . ’
31499	31516	31319	31319	Lancelot	172	‘ You will have a fine opportunity this evening . Do n’t you dine at Minchampstead ? ’
31517	31523	31056	31056	Lancelot	172	‘ Yes . Do you ? ’
31524	31543	31056	31056	Lancelot	172	‘ Mr. Jingle dines everywhere , except at home . Will you take me over in your trap ? ’
31544	31554	31319	31319	Lancelot	172	‘ Done . But whom shall we meet there ? ’
31555	31598	31056	31056	Lancelot	172	‘ The Lavingtons , and Vieuxbois , and Vaurien , and a parson or two , I suppose . But between Saint Venus and Vieuxbois you may soon learn enough to make you a sadder man , if not a wiser one . ’
31599	31621	31622	31623	The colonel	504	‘ Why not a wiser one ? Sadder than now I can not be ; or less wise , God knows . ’
31655	31770	31622	31623	The colonel	504	‘ My young friend , you have been a little too much on the stilts heretofore . Take care that , now you are off them , you do n’t lie down and sleep , instead of walking honestly on your legs . Have faith in yourself ; pick these men ’s brains , and all men ’s . You can do it . Say to yourself boldly , as the false prophet in India said to the missionary , “ I have fire enough in my stomach to burn up ” a dozen stucco and filigree reformers and “ assimilate their ashes into the bargain , like one of Liebig ’s cabbages . ” ’
31771	31807	31813	31814	the colonel	504	‘ How can I have faith in myself , when I am playing traitor to myself every hour in the day ? And yet faith in something I must have : in woman , perhaps . ’

31818	31861	31813	31814	the colonel	504	‘ In anything but woman ? She must be led , not leader . If you love a woman , make her have faith in you . If you lean on her , you will ruin yourself , and her as well . ’
31872	31903	31904	31905	The colonel	504	‘ After all , colonel , I think there must be a meaning in those old words our mothers used to teach us about “ having faith in God . ” ’
31910	31950	31904	31905	The colonel	504	‘ Quien sabe ? said the Spanish girl , when they asked her who was her child ’s father . But here comes my kit on a clod ’s back , and it is time to dress for dinner . ’
32114	32160	32101	32102	Thomas Newbroom	252	‘ I stood behind a loom myself , my boy , when I began life ; and you must do with great means what I did with little ones . I have made a gentleman of you , you must make a nobleman of yourself . ’

In the middle ages , books tell us , they worshipped the knights errant . They are always on the winning side , the cunning little beauties . In the war - time , when the soldiers had to play the world ’s game , the ladies all caught the red - coat fever ; now , in these talking and thinking days ( and be hanged to them for bores ) , they have the black - coat fever for the same reason . The parsons are the workers now - a - days — or rather , all the world expects them to be so . They have the game in their own hands , if they did but know how to play it . ’

33371	33380	33368	33369	Lord Vieuxbois	241	‘ I am sure I know his face . ’
33381	33398	33766	33767	Lord Vieuxbois	241	‘ Lancelot Smith , the man who has taken the shooting - box at Lower Whitford . ’
33399	33522	33368	33369	Lord Vieuxbois	241	‘ Oh , I remember him well enough at Cambridge ! He was one of a set who tried to look like blackguards , and really succeeded tolerably . They used to eschew gloves , and drink nothing but beer , and smoke disgusting short pipes ; and when we established the Coverley Club in Trinity , they set up an opposition , and called themselves the Navvies . And they used to make piratical expeditions down to Lynn in eight oars , to attack bargemen , and fen girls , and shoot ducks , and sleep under turf - stacks , and come home when they had drank all the public - house taps dry . I remember the man perfectly . ’
33523	33528	33530	33531	the colonel	504	‘ Navvy or none , ’
33533	33568	33530	33531	the colonel	504	‘ he has just the longest head and the noblest heart of any man I ever met . If he does not distinguish himself before he dies , I know nothing of human nature . ’
33569	33658	33368	33369	Lord Vieuxbois	241	‘ Ah yes , I believe he is clever enough!—took a good degree , a better one than I did — but horribly eclectic ; full of mesmerism , and German metaphysics , and all that sort of thing . I heard of him one night last spring , on which he had been seen , if you will believe it , going successively into a Swedenborgian chapel , the Garrick ’s Head , and one of Elliotson ’s magnetic soirées . What can you expect after that ? ’
33659	33664	33666	33666	Bracebridge	139	‘ A great deal , ’
33669	33727	33666	33666	Bracebridge	139	‘ With such a head as he carries on his shoulders the man might be another Mirabeau , if he held the right cards in the right rubber . And he really ought to suit you , for he raves about the middle ages , and chivalry , and has edited a book full of old ballads . ’
33728	33764	33766	33767	Lord Vieuxbois	241	‘ Oh , all the eclectics do that sort of thing ; and small thanks to them . However , I will speak to him after dinner , and see what there is in him . ’
33939	33947	33927	33927	he	172	‘ it never rains but it pours , ’
34013	34019	34021	34022	the host	1298	‘ Well , Lord Vieuxbois , ’
34026	34045	34021	34022	the host	1298	‘ my girls are raving about your new school . They say it is a perfect antiquarian gem . ’
34046	34094	34021	34022	the host	1298	‘ Yes , tolerable , I believe . But Wales has disappointed me a little . That vile modernist naturalism is creeping back even into our painted glass . I could have wished that the artist ’s designs for the windows had been a little more Catholic . ’
34095	34099	34101	34102	the host	1298	‘ How then ? ’
34109	34115	34117	34117	Bracebridge	139	‘ Oh , he means , ’
34119	34123	34117	34117	Bracebridge	139	‘ that the figures ’

34403	34471	34476	34476	Smith	172	’ Lancelot might as well have held his tongue — nobody understood him but Vieuxbois , and he had been taught to scent German neology in everything , as some folks are taught to scent Jesuitry , especially when it involved an inductive law , and not a mere red - tape precedent , and , therefore , could not see that Lancelot was arguing for him . ‘
34478	34483	34476	34476	Smith	172	’ said the squire ; ‘

34944	34978	34941	34942	Lord Minchampstead	250	‘ we have the most noble accounts of heroic industry and self - sacrifice in girls whose education , to judge by its fruits , might shame that of most English young ladies . ’
35032	35039	35041	35042	Lord Minchampstead	250	‘ It is a great pity , ’
35044	35152	35041	35042	Lord Minchampstead	250	‘ that our factory girls are not in the same state of civilisation . But it is socially impossible . America is in an abnormal state . In a young country the laws of political economy do not make themselves fully felt . Here , where we have no uncleared world to drain the labour - market , we may pity and alleviate the condition of the working - classes , but we can do nothing more . All the modern schemes for the amelioration which ignore the laws of competition , must end either in pauperisation’—(with a glance at Lord Vieuxbois),—‘or in the destruction of property . ’
35211	35256	35204	35204	he	265	‘ You think , then , my lord , that in the present state of society , no dead - lift can be given to the condition — in plain English , the wages — of working men , without the destruction of property ? ’
35266	35288	35257	35258	Lord Minchampstead	250	‘ There may be other dead - lift ameliorations , my young friend , besides a dead - lift of wages . ’

35451	35469	35392	35393	the gentry	1349	‘ And pray , Mr. Smith , may I ask what limit you would put to education ? ’
35470	35477	35479	35479	Lancelot	172	‘ The capacities of each man , ’
35481	35598	35479	35479	Lancelot	172	‘ If man living in civilised society has one right which he can demand it is this , that the State which exists by his labour shall enable him to develop , or , at least , not hinder his developing , his whole faculties to their very utmost , however lofty that may be . While a man who might be an author remains a spade - drudge , or a journeyman while he has capacities for a master ; while any man able to rise in life remains by social circumstances lower than he is willing to place himself , that man has a right to complain of the State ’s injustice and neglect . ’
35599	35607	35609	35609	Vieuxbois	241	‘ Really , I do not see , ’
35611	35646	35609	35609	Vieuxbois	241	‘ why people should wish to rise in life . They had no such self - willed fancy in the good old times . The whole notion is a product of these modern days — ’
35664	35670	35672	35672	Lancelot	172	‘ I think , honestly , ’
35679	35760	35672	35672	Lancelot	172	‘ that we gentlemen all run into the same fallacy . We fancy ourselves the fixed and necessary element in society , to which all others are to accommodate themselves . “ Given the rights of the few rich , to find the condition of the many poor . ” It seems to me that other postulate is quite as fair : “ Given the rights of the many poor , to find the condition of the few rich . ” ’
35765	35794	35761	35762	Lord Minchampstead	250	‘ If you hit us so hard , Mr. Smith , I must really denounce you as a Communist . Lord Vieuxbois , shall we join the ladies ? ’
36118	36189	36194	36194	Lancelot	172	‘ Who am I to demand her all to myself ? Her , the glorious , the saintly , the unfallen ! Is not a look , a word , infinitely more than I deserve ? And yet I pretend to admire tales of chivalry ! Old knightly hearts would have fought and wandered for years to earn a tithe of the favours which have been bestowed on me unasked . ’

36581	36590	36561	36562	Mrs. Lavington	158	‘ I thought you disliked him so much . ’
36591	36635	36642	36642	Argemone	150	‘ His opinions , my child ; but we must hope for the best . He seems moral and well inclined , and really desirous of doing good in his way ; and so successful in the House , too , I hear . ’
36636	36640	36642	36642	Argemone	150	‘ To me , ’
36644	36690	36642	36642	Argemone	150	‘ he seems to want life , originality , depth , everything that makes a great man . He knows nothing but what he has picked up ready - made from books . After all , his opinions are the one redeeming point in him . ’
36691	36713	36561	36562	Mrs. Lavington	158	‘ Ah , my dear , when it pleases Heaven to open your eyes , you will see as I do ! ’

36808	36878	36803	36804	Mrs. Lavington	158	‘ to see a young man so benighted and thrown away . With his vast fortune , too — such a means of good ! Really we ought to have seen a little more of him . I think Mr. O’Blareaway ’s conversation might be a blessing to him . I think of asking him over to stay a week at Whitford , to meet that sainted young man . ’
36936	36969	36930	36930	she	150	‘ Really , mamma , a week of Lord Vieuxbois will be too much . We shall be bored to death with the Cambridge Camden Society , and ballads for the people . ’

37003	37035	36979	36980	Mrs. Lavington	158	‘ I think , my dear , that his conversation , with all its faults , will be a very improving change for your father . I hope he ’s asleep . ’
37044	37116	36979	36980	Mrs. Lavington	158	‘ Really , what between Mr. Smith , and Colonel Bracebridge , and their very ineligible friend , Mr. Mellot , whom I should never have allowed to enter my house if I had suspected his religious views , the place has become a hotbed of false doctrine and heresy . I have been quite frightened when I have heard their conversation at dinner , lest the footmen should turn infidels ! ’
37117	37122	37124	37124	Honoria	162	‘ Perhaps , mamma , ’
37128	37153	37124	37124	Honoria	162	‘ Lord Vieuxbois might convert them to something quite as bad . How shocking if old Giles , the butler , should turn Papist ! ’
37154	37193	36979	36980	Mrs. Lavington	158	‘ Honoria , you are very silly . Lord Vieuxbois , at least can be trusted . He has no liking for low companions . He is above joking with grooms , and taking country walks with gamekeepers . ’
37210	37254	37203	37203	Honoria	162	‘ Your poor father ’s mind has been quite unsettled by all their ribaldry . They have kept him so continually amused , that all my efforts to bring him to a sense of his awful state have been more unavailing than ever . ’
37461	37464	37465	37465	she	150	‘ Indeed , ’
37468	37506	37465	37465	she	150	‘ if amusement is bad for my father , he is not likely to get much of it during Lord Vieuxbois ’s stay . But , of course , mamma , you will do as you please . ’
37507	37516	37518	37520	the good lady	3239	‘ Of course I shall , my dear , ’

37594	37701	37582	37582	she	150	‘ Plans for my good!’—And an unworthy suspicion about her mother crossed her mind , and was peremptorily expelled again . What turn the conversation would have taken next , I know not , but at that moment Honoria and her mother uttered a fearful shriek , as their side of the carriage jolted half - way up the bank , and stuck still in that pleasant position . The squire awoke , and the ladies simultaneously clapped their hands to their ears , knowing what was coming . He thrust his head out of the window , and discharged a broadside of at least ten pounds ’

37867	37895	37864	37865	the squire	3125	‘ with both my hands red - hot with the gout ? You must drive three of us , colonel , and one of us must walk . ’

37959	38004	37947	37947	Honoria	162	‘ Argemone ’s safe enough with Smith ; the servants will lead the horses behind them . It ’s only three miles home , and I should like to see any one speak to her twice while Smith ’s fists are in the way . ’

38339	38356	38263	38264	A nightingale	1423	‘ What but love , the fulness of all joy , the evoker of all song ? ’
38357	38365	38263	38264	A nightingale	1423	‘ All song?—The angels sing in heaven . ’
38366	38380	38263	38264	A nightingale	1423	‘ So they say : but the angels must love if they sing . ’
38381	38386	38263	38264	A nightingale	1423	‘ They love God ! ’
38387	38393	38263	38264	A nightingale	1423	‘ And no one else ? ’
38394	38417	38263	38264	A nightingale	1423	‘ Oh yes : but that is universal , spiritual love ; not earthly love — a narrow passion for an individual . ’
38418	38436	38263	38264	A nightingale	1423	‘ How do we know that they do not learn to love all by first loving one ? ’
38437	38446	38263	38264	A nightingale	1423	‘ Oh , the angelic life is single ! ’

Not merely by their defects and inconsistencies ; not merely because they go on taunting us , and shrieking at us with the cry that we ought to go to Rome , till we at last , wearied out , take them at their word , and do at their bidding the thing we used to shrink from with terror — not this merely but the very doctrines we hold in common with them , have sent me to Rome . For would these men have known of them if Rome had not been ? The Trinity — the Atonement — the Inspiration of Scripture.—A future state — that point on which the present generation , without a smattering of psychological science , without even the old belief in apparitions , dogmatises so narrowly and arrogantly — what would they have known of them but for Rome ? And she says there are three realms in the future state ... heaven , hell , and purgatory ... What right have they to throw away the latter , and arbitrarily retain the two former ? I am told that Scripture gives no warrant for a third state . She says that it does — that it teaches that implicitly , as it teaches other , the very highest doctrines ; some hold , the Trinity itself ... It may be proved from Scripture ; for it may be proved from the love and justice of God revealed in Scripture . The Protestants divide — in theory , that is — mankind into two classes , the righteous , who are destined to infinite bliss ; the wicked , who are doomed to infinite torment ; in which latter class , to make their arbitrary division exhaustive , they put of course nine hundred and ninety - nine out of the thousand , and doom to everlasting companionship with Borgias and Cagliostros , the gentle , frivolous girl , or the peevish boy , who would have shrunk , in life , with horror from the contact ... Well , at least , their hell is hellish enough ... if it were but just ... But I , Lancelot , I can not believe it ! I will not believe it ! I had a brother once — affectionate , simple , generous , full of noble aspirations — but without , alas ! a thought of God ; yielding in a hundred little points , and some great ones , to the infernal temptations of a public school ... He died at seventeen . Where is he now ? Lancelot ! where is he now ? Never for a day has that thought left my mind for years . Not in heaven — for he has no right there ; Protestants would say that as well as I ... Where , then?—Lancelot ! not in that other place . I can not , I will not believe it . For the sake of God ’s honour , as well as of my own sanity , I will not believe it ! There must be some third place — some intermediate chance , some door of hope — some purifying and redeeming process beyond the grave ... Why not a purifying fire ? Ages of that are surely punishment enough — and if there be a fire of hell , why not a fire of purgatory ? ... After all , the idea of purgatory as a fire is only an opinion , not a dogma of the Church ... But if the gross flesh which has sinned is to be punished by the matter which it has abused , why may it not be purified by it ? ’
41048	41275	41276	41276	I	0	‘ You may laugh , if you will , at both , and say again , as I have heard you say ere now , that the popular Christian paradise and hell are but a Pagan Olympus and Tartarus , as grossly material as Mahomet ’s , without the honest thorough - going sexuality , which you thought made his notion logical and consistent ... Well , you may say that , but Protestants can not ; for their idea of heaven and ours is the same — with this exception , that theirs will contain but a thin band of saved ones , while ours will fill and grow to all eternity ... I tell you , Lancelot , it is just the very doctrines for which England most curses Rome , and this very purgatory at the head of them , which constitute her strength and her allurement ; which appeal to the reason , the conscience , the heart of men , like me , who have revolted from the novel superstition which looks pitilessly on at the fond memories of the brother , the prayers of the orphan , the doubled desolation of the widow , with its cold terrible assurance , “ There is no hope for thy loved and lost ones — no hope , but hell for evermore ! ” ‘
41390	41452	41455	41455	you	1488	’ Lancelot read this , and re - read it ; and smiled , but sadly — and the more he read , the stronger its arguments seemed to him , and he rejoiced thereat . For there is a bad pleasure — happy he who has not felt it — in a pitiless reductio ad absurdum , which asks tauntingly , ‘

For many a night did I go down that mine out of my turn , and sat for hours in that level , watching and watching , if perhaps the spirit of him might haunt about , and tell his poor brother one word of news — one way or the other — anything would have been a comfort — but the doubt I could n’t bear . And yet at last I learnt to bear it — and what ’s more , I learnt not to care for it . It ’s a bold word — there ’s one who knows whether or not it is a true one . ’
42242	42253	42065	42065	his	1504	‘ Good Heavens!—and what then did you say to yourself ? ’
42254	42393	42065	42065	his	1504	‘ I said this , sir — or rather , one came as I was on my knees , and said it to me — What ’s done you ca n’t mend . What ’s left , you can . Whatever has happened is God ’s concern now , and none but His . Do you see that as far as you can no such thing ever happen again , on the face of His earth . And from that day , sir , I gave myself up to that one thing , and will until I die , to save the poor young fellows like myself , who are left now - a - days to the Devil , body and soul , just when they are in the prime of their power to work for God . ’

No doubt the fellow has committed an unpardonable sin in daring to come into the world when there was no call for him ; one used to think , certainly , that children ’s opinions were not consulted on such points before they were born , and that therefore it might be hard to visit the sins of the fathers on the children , even though the labour - market were a little overstocked—“mais nous avons changé tout cela , ” like M. Jourdain ’s doctors . No doubt , too , the fellow might have got work if he had chosen — in Kamschatka or the Cannibal Islands ; for the political economists have proved , beyond a doubt , that there is work somewhere or other for every one who chooses to work . But as , unfortunately , society has neglected to inform him of the state of the Cannibal Island labour - market , or to pay his passage thither when informed thereof , he has had to choose in the somewhat limited labour - field of the Whitford Priors ’

A large gang of poachers , who had come down from London by rail , had been devastating all the covers round , to stock the London markets by the first of October , and intended , as Tregarva had discovered , to pay Mr. Lavington ’s preserves a visit that night . They did n’t care for country justices , not they . Were n’t all their fines paid by highly respectable game - dealers at the West end ? They owned three dog - carts among them ; a parcel by railway would bring them down bail to any amount ; they tossed their money away at the public - houses , like gentlemen ; thanks to the Game Laws , their profits ran high , and when they had swept the country pretty clean of game , why , they would just finish off the season by a stray highway robbery or two , and vanish into Babylon and their native night . Such was Harry Verney ’s information as he strutted about the courtyard waiting for the squire ’s orders . ‘

47151	47162	47149	47149	Lancelot	172	‘ the parsons say all to them that they can . ’
47168	47274	47165	47165	his	173	‘ I doubt that , sir . But , no doubt , there ’s a great change for the better in the parsons . I remember the time , sir , that there was n’t an earnest clergyman in the vale ; and now every other man you meet is trying to do his best . But those London parsons , sir , what ’s the matter with them ? For all their societies and their schools , the devil seems to keep ahead of them sadly . I doubt they have n’t found the right fly yet for publicans and sinners to rise at . ’
47282	47304	47165	47165	his	173	‘ There they are , sir . I thought that Crawy would n’t lead me false when I let him off . ’
47305	47330	47347	47347	his	3125	‘ Well , fight away , then , and win . I have promised Miss Lavington not to lift a hand in the business . ’
47331	47334	47165	47165	his	173	‘ Then you ’re
47360	47378	47357	47358	our master	1626	’ There was a rustle in the bushes , and a tramp of feet on the turf . ‘
47397	47496	47388	47389	The Lord	817	’ And Tregarva pulled off his neckcloth , and shook his huge limbs , as if to feel that they were all in their places , in a way that augured ill for the man who came across him . They turned the corner of a ride , and , in an instant , found themselves face to face with five or six armed men , with blackened faces , who , without speaking a word , dashed at them , and the fight began ; reinforcements came up on each side , and the engagement became general . ‘
47524	47554	47512	47512	They	1627	‘ The metal good and the walnut - wood Did soon in splinters flee ; They tossed the orts to south and north , And grappled knee to knee . ‘
47582	47759	48226	48226	You	1633	’ And all the while the broad still moon stared down on them grim and cold , as if with a saturnine sneer at the whole humbug ; and the silly birds about whom all this butchery went on , slept quietly over their heads , every one with his head under his wing . Oh ! if pheasants had but understanding , how they would split their sides with chuckling and crowing at the follies which civilised Christian men perpetrate for their precious sake ! Had I the pen of Homer ( though they say he never used one ) , or even that of the worthy who wasted precious years in writing a Homer Burlesqued , what heroic exploits might not I immortalise ! In every stupid serf and cunning ruffian there , there was a heart as brave as Ajax ’s own ; but then they fought with sticks instead of lances , and hammered away on fustian jackets instead of brazen shields ; and , therefore , poor fellows , they were beneath ‘
47765	47776	48226	48226	You	1633	’ whatever that may mean . If one of your squeamish ‘
47782	48081	48226	48226	You	1633	’ critics had just had his head among the gun - stocks for five minutes that night , he would have found it grim tragic earnest enough ; not without a touch of fun though , here and there . Lancelot leant against a tree and watched the riot with folded arms , mindful of his promise to Argemone , and envied Tregarva as he hurled his assailants right and left with immense strength , and led the van of battle royally . Little would Argemone have valued the real proof of love which he was giving her as he looked on sulkily , while his fingers tingled with longing to be up and doing . Strange — that mere lust of fighting , common to man and animals , whose traces even the lamb and the civilised child evince in their mock - fights , the earliest and most natural form of play . Is it , after all , the one human propensity which is utterly evil , incapable of being turned to any righteous use ? Gross and animal , no doubt it is , but not the less really pleasant , as every Irishman and many an Englishman knows well enough . A curious instance of this , by the bye , occurred in Paris during the February Revolution . A fat English coachman went out , from mere curiosity , to see the fighting . As he stood and watched , a new passion crept over him ; he grew madder and madder as the bullets whistled past him ; at last , when men began to drop by his side , he could stand it no longer , seized a musket , and rushed in , careless which side he took , — ‘
48091	48225	48226	48226	You	1633	’ He was not heard of for a day or two , and then they found him stiff and cold , lying on his face across a barricade , with a bullet through his heart . Sedentary persons may call him a sinful fool . Be it so . Homo sum : humani nihil à me alienum puto . Lancelot , I verily believe , would have kept his promise , though he saw that the keepers gave ground , finding Cockney skill too much for their clumsy strength ; but at last Harry Verney , who had been fighting as venomously as a wild cat , and had been once before saved from a broken skull by Tregarva , rolled over at his very feet with a couple of poachers on him . ‘
48238	48294	48295	48295	he	1634	’ cried he , imploringly . Lancelot tore the ruffians off the old man right and left . One of them struck him ; he returned the blow ; and , in an instant , promises and Argemone , philosophy and anti - game - law prejudices , were swept out of his head , and ‘
48298	48305	48295	48295	he	1634	’ as the old romances say , ‘
48314	48346	48295	48295	he	1634	’ as mere a wild animal for the moment as angry bull or boar . An instant afterwards , though , he burst out laughing , in spite of himself , as ‘
48351	48377	48347	48349	The Battersea Bantam	298	’ who had been ineffectually dancing round Tregarva like a gamecock spurring at a bull , turned off with a voice of ineffable disgust , — ‘
48394	48427	48347	48349	The Battersea Bantam	298	’re my man , if you please , sir,’—and the little wiry lump of courage and conceit , rascality and good humour , flew at Lancelot , who was twice his size , ‘
48437	48459	48393	48393	You	1633	’ as respectable papers , when they are not too frightened , say of the French . * * * * * ‘
48466	48470	48475	48475	sir	753	’ asked Lancelot . ‘
48508	48671	48505	48505	you	753	’ Alas for the little man ! in another moment he tumbled over and lay senseless — Lancelot thought he had killed him . The gang saw their champion fall , gave ground , and limped off , leaving three of their party groaning on the ground , beside as many Whitford men . As it was in the beginning , so is it to be to the end , my foolish brothers ! From the poacher to the prime minister — wearying yourselves for very vanity ! The soldier is not the only man in England who is fool enough to be shot at for a shilling a day . But while all the rest were busy picking up the wounded men and securing the prisoners , Harry Verney alone held on , and as the poachers retreated slowly up the ride , he followed them , peering into the gloom , as if in hopes of recognising some old enemy . ‘
48693	48702	48683	48683	we	1639	’ cried a voice out of the darkness . ‘
48740	48769	48722	48722	You	174	’re to carry the county before you , because you get your fines paid by London - tradesmen ! Eh ? What do you take old Harry for ? ’
48770	48778	48823	48825	the old man	3135	‘ Go back , you old fool ! ’
48786	48807	48823	48825	the old man	3135	‘ If you follow us , we ’ll fire at you , as sure as the moon ’s in heaven ! ’
48808	48821	48823	48825	the old man	3135	‘ Fire away , then ! I ’ll follow you to — ! ’
48848	48858	48834	48834	Tregarva	173	‘ What , you will have it , then ? ’
48916	48926	48928	48929	the rascals	1646	‘ You ’ve done it ! off with you ! ’
48954	48981	48939	48939	Tregarva	173	‘ They ’ve done for me , Paul . Old Harry ’s got his gruel . He ’s heard his last shot fired . I knowed it ’
49002	49041	49000	49000	Paul	173	’ And as the old man spoke , the workings of his lungs pumped great jets of blood out over the still heather - flowers as they slept in the moonshine , and dabbled them with smoking gore . ‘
49046	49051	49095	49095	Tregarva	173	’ shouted the colonel , ‘
49116	49125	49126	49126	You	1652	’ And they moved off towards the Priory . ‘
49134	49147	49126	49126	You	1652	’ said Lancelot . The colonel did not answer for a moment . ‘
49186	49187	49188	49188	Paul	173	’ ‘
49193	49198	49188	49188	Paul	173	’ whispered old Harry , ‘
49221	49230	49211	49212	a man	445	’ It was his own life - blood . ‘
49303	49304	49298	49299	the Lord	817	’ ‘
49309	49313	49315	49315	He	1658	’ said Paul , ‘
49333	49334	49325	49325	He	1658	’ ‘
49373	49378	49361	49361	you	173	’ Paul turned pale . ‘
49395	49396	49397	49398	The Lord	817	’ ‘
49404	49478	49397	49398	The Lord	817	’ said Paul , solemnly . Wearily and slowly they stepped on towards the old man ’s cottage . A messenger had gone on before , and in a few minutes the squire , Mrs. Lavington , and the girls , were round the bed of their old retainer . They sent off right and left for the doctor and the vicar ; the squire was in a frenzy of rage and grief . ‘
49491	49513	49484	49484	master	1667	’ said old Harry , as he lay ; while the colonel and Honoria in vain endeavoured to stanch the wound . ‘
49525	49553	49557	49557	Paul	173	’ tis all in the way of business . They have n’t carried off a bird , squire , not a bird ; we was too many for ’em

49569	49574	49578	49578	colonel	530	’ said the squire . ‘
49589	49627	49628	49630	The second keeper	1670	’ Alas ! the charge of shot at a few feet distance had entered like a bullet , tearing a great ragged hole.—There was no hope , and the colonel knew it ; but he said nothing . ‘
49632	49636	49628	49630	The second keeper	1670	’ sighed Argemone , ‘
49660	49675	49653	49653	God	281	’ Lancelot said nothing . The old man lighted up at Argemone ’s voice . ‘
49731	49795	49816	49816	she	150	’re dead and gone,—dead and gone,—squire , they ’ll be the pride of Whitford still ! And they ’ll keep up the old place — won’t you , my darlings ? And the old name , too ! For , you know , there must always be a Lavington in Whitford Priors , till the Nun ’s pool runs up to Ashy Down . ’
49796	49804	49808	49808	herself	150	‘ And a curse upon the Lavingtons , ’
49844	49847	49848	49848	he	3135	‘ Windy , ’
49853	49899	49848	49848	he	3135	‘ windy , dark and windy — birds wo n’t lie — not old Harry ’s fault . How black it grows ! We must be gone by nightfall , squire . Where ’s that young dog gone ? Arter the larks , the brute . ’
49908	49918	49920	49921	the vicar	3366	‘ You will soon be home , my man , ’
49923	49939	49920	49921	the vicar	3366	‘ Remember that you have a Saviour in heaven . Cast yourself on His mercy . ’
49945	49996	49942	49942	his	174	‘ Very good words , very kind,—very heavy gamebag , though . Never get home , never any more at all . Where ’s my boy Tom to carry it ? Send for my boy Tom . He was always a good boy till he got along with them poachers . ’
49997	50000	50001	50001	he	174	‘ Listen , ’
50004	50026	50027	50027	He	174	‘ listen ! There ’s bells a - ringing — ringing in my head . Come you here , Paul Tregarva . ’
50041	50055	50027	50027	He	174	‘ Them ’s the bells a - ringing for Miss Honor ’s wedding . ’
50083	50091	50062	50062	Harry	174	‘ What ’s that thumping and roaring ? ’
50104	50124	50100	50100	his	174	‘ It ’s the weir , the weir — a - washing me away — thundering over me.—Squire , I ’m
50174	50226	50227	50227	His	174	’ Tain’t my fault , squire , so help me — Don’t swear , now , squire ; old men and dying maun’t swear , squire . How steady the river runs down ? Lower and slower — lower and slower : now it ’s quite still — still — still — ’
50273	50299	50269	50269	he	174	‘ There ai n’t such a head of hares on any manor in the county . And them ’s the last words of Harry Verney ! ’
50659	50664	50665	50665	he	1690	‘ The best authorities ? ’
50670	50796	50665	50665	he	1690	‘ On what question do not the best authorities flatly contradict each other ? And why ? Because every man believes just what it suits him to believe . Do n’t fancy that men reason themselves into convictions ; the prejudices and feelings of their hearts give them some idea or theory , and then they find facts at their leisure to prove their theory true . Every man sees facts through narrow spectacles , red , or green , or blue , as his nation or his temperament colours them : and he is quite right , only he must allow us the liberty of having our spectacles too . Authority is only good for proving facts . We must draw our own conclusions . ’
51115	51120	51087	51087	he	172	‘ Urim and Thummim , ’
51194	51217	51218	51218	He	172	‘ He was altered , and began To move about the house with joy , And with the certain step of man . ’
51722	51759	51704	51704	his	172	‘ Come to us ! and with one touch of your finger , send that bursting spirit which throbs against your brow to flit forth free , and nevermore to defile her purity by your presence ! ’
52107	52114	52115	52115	she	1714	‘ What do you believe in ? ’
52123	52127	52128	52128	he	172	‘ In this ! ’
52138	52276	52128	52128	he	172	‘ In the earth I stand on , and the things I see walking and growing on it . There may be something beside it — what you call a spiritual world . But if He who made me intended me to think of spirit first , He would have let me see it first . But as He has given me material senses , and put me in a material world , I take it as a fair hint that I am meant to use those senses first , whatever may come after . I may be intended to understand the unseen world , but if so , it must be , as I suspect , by understanding the visible one : and there are enough wonders there to occupy me for some time to come . ’
52277	52282	52284	52284	Argemone	150	‘ But the Bible ? ’
52294	52297	52128	52128	he	172	‘ Church . ’
52299	52341	52284	52284	Argemone	150	‘ My only Bible as yet is Bacon . I know that he is right , whoever is wrong . If that Hebrew Bible is to be believed by me , it must agree with what I know already from science . ’
52591	52596	52578	52578	his	172	‘ Triumph of Woman . ’
53184	53200	53171	53171	She	150	‘ You do not like it ! I have been too bold,’—said Lancelot , fearfully . ‘
53227	53379	54125	54125	he	1758	’ Lancelot slipped silently out of the room , he hardly knew why ; and when he was gone , Argemone caught up the drawing , pressed it to her bosom , covered it with kisses , and hid it , as too precious for any eyes but her own , in the farthest corner of her secrétaire . And yet she fancied that she was not in love ! The vicar saw the growth of this intimacy with a fast - lengthening face ; for it was very evident that Argemone could not serve two masters so utterly contradictory as himself and Lancelot , and that either the lover or the father - confessor must speedily resign office . The vicar had had great disadvantages , by the bye , in fulfilling the latter function ; for his visits at the Priory had been all but forbidden ; and Argemone ’s ‘
53382	53634	54125	54125	he	1758	’ had been directed by means of a secret correspondence,—a method which some clergymen , and some young ladies too , have discovered , in the last few years , to be quite consistent with moral delicacy and filial obedience . John Bull , like a stupid fellow as he is , has still his doubts upon the point ; but he should remember that though St. Paul tells women when they want advice to ask their husbands at home , yet if the poor woman has no husband , or , as often happens , her husband ’s advice is unpleasant , to whom is she to go but to the next best substitute , her spiritual cicisbeo , or favourite clergyman ? In sad earnest , neither husband nor parent deserves pity in the immense majority of such cases . Woman will have guidance . It is her delight and glory to be led ; and if her husband or her parents will not meet the cravings of her intellect , she must go elsewhere to find a teacher , and run into the wildest extravagances of private judgment , in the very hope of getting rid of it , just as poor Argemone had been led to do . And , indeed , she had , of late , wandered into very strange paths : would to God they were as uncommon as strange ! Both she and the vicar had a great wish that she should lead a ‘
53638	53700	54125	54125	he	1758	’ but then they both disdained to use common means for their object . The good old English plan of district visiting , by which ladies can have mercy on the bodies and souls of those below them , without casting off the holy discipline which a home , even the most ungenial , alone supplies , savoured too much of mere ‘
53703	53734	54125	54125	he	1758	’ It might be God ’s plan for christianising England just now , but that was no reason , alas ! for its being their plan : they wanted something more ‘
53737	53874	54125	54125	he	1758	’ more in accordance with Church principles ( for , indeed , is it not the business of the Church to correct the errors of Providence ! ) ; and what they sought they found at once in a certain favourite establishment of the vicar ’s , a Church - of - England béguinage , or quasi - Protestant nunnery , which he fostered in a neighbouring city , and went thither on all high tides to confess the young ladies , who were in all things nuns , but bound by no vows , except , of course , such as they might choose to make for themselves in private . Here they laboured among the lowest haunts of misery and sin , piously and self - denyingly enough , sweet souls ! in hope of ‘
53879	53895	54125	54125	he	1758	’ and a higher place in heaven than the relations whom they had left behind them ‘
53900	54012	54125	54125	he	1758	’ and unshackled by the interference of parents , and other such merely fleshly relationships , which , as they can not have been instituted by God merely to be trampled under foot on the path to holiness , and can not well have instituted themselves ( unless , after all , the Materialists are right , and this world does grind of itself , except when its Maker happens to interfere once every thousand years ) , must needs have been instituted by the devil . And so more than one girl in that nunnery , and out of it , too , believed in her inmost heart , though her ‘
54016	54124	54125	54125	he	1758	’ by a happy inconsistency , forbade her to say so . In a moment of excitement , fascinated by the romance of the notion , Argemone had proposed to her mother to allow her to enter this béguinage , and called in the vicar as advocate ; which produced a correspondence between him and Mrs. Lavington , stormy on her side , provokingly calm on his : and when the poor lady , tired of raging , had descended to an affecting appeal to his human sympathies , entreating him to spare a mother ’s feelings , he had answered with the same impassive fanaticism , that ‘
54145	54148	54125	54125	he	1758	’ and that ‘
54172	54183	54162	54162	he	1758	’ to which Mrs. Lavington answered , naively enough , that ‘
54195	54327	54329	54329	her	1762	’—So he was all but forbidden the house . Nevertheless he contrived , by means of this same secret correspondence , to keep alive in Argemone ’s mind the longing to turn nun , and fancied honestly that he was doing God service , while he was pampering the poor girl ’s lust for singularity and self - glorification . But , lately , Argemone ’s letters had become less frequent and less confiding ; and the vicar , who well knew the reason , had resolved to bring the matter to a crisis . So he wrote earnestly and peremptorily to his pupil , urging her , with all his subtle and refined eloquence , to make a final appeal to her mother , and if that failed , to act ‘
54335	54456	54329	54329	her	1762	’ and enclosed an answer from the superior of the convent , to a letter which Argemone had in a mad moment asked him to write . The superior ’s letter spoke of Argemone ’s joining her as a settled matter , and of her room as ready for her , while it lauded to the skies the peaceful activity and usefulness of the establishment . This letter troubled Argemone exceedingly . She had never before been compelled to face her own feelings , either about the nunnery or about Lancelot . She had taken up the fancy of becoming a Sister of Charity , not as Honoria might have done , from genuine love of the poor , but from ‘
54462	55006	54329	54329	her	1762	’ Almsgiving and visiting the sick were one of the methods of earning heaven prescribed by her new creed . She was ashamed of her own laziness by the side of Honoria ’s simple benevolence ; and , sad though it may be to have to say it , she longed to outdo her by some signal act of self - sacrifice . She had looked to this nunnery , too , as an escape , once and for all , from her own luxury , just as people who have not strength to be temperate take refuge in teetotalism ; and the thought of menial services towards the poor , however distasteful to her , came in quite prettily to fill up the little ideal of a life of romantic asceticisms and mystic contemplation , which gave the true charm in her eyes to her wild project . But now — just as a field had opened to her cravings after poetry and art , wider and richer than she had ever imagined — just as those simple childlike views of man and nature , which she had learnt to despise , were assuming an awful holiness in her eyes — just as she had found a human soul to whose regeneration she could devote all her energies,—to be required to give all up , perhaps for ever ( and she felt that if at all , it ought to be for ever);—it was too much for her little heart to bear ; and she cried bitterly ; and tried to pray , and could not ; and longed for a strong and tender bosom on which to lay her head , and pour out all her doubts and struggles ; and there was none . Her mother did not understand — hardly loved her . Honoria loved her ; but understood her even less than her mother . Pride — the pride of intellect , the pride of self - will — had long since sealed her lips to her own family ... And then , out of the darkness of her heart , Lancelot ’s image rose before her stronger than all , tenderer than all ; and as she remembered his magical faculty of anticipating all her thoughts , embodying for her all her vague surmises , he seemed to beckon her towards him.—She shuddered and turned away . And now she first became conscious how he had haunted her thoughts in the last few months , not as a soul to be saved , but as a living man — his face , his figure , his voice , his every gesture and expression , rising clear before her , in spite of herself , by day and night . And then she thought of his last drawing , and the looks which had accompanied it,—unmistakable looks of passionate and adoring love . There was no denying it — she had always known that he loved her , but she had never dared to confess it to herself . But now the earthquake was come , and all the secrets of her heart burst upward to the light , and she faced the thought in shame and terror . ‘
55027	55048	55049	55049	I	0	’ She lifted up her eyes , and saw in the mirror opposite the reflection of her own exquisite beauty . ‘
55244	55259	55224	55224	I	0	’ She flung herself on her knees — she could not collect her thoughts . ‘
55262	55266	55224	55224	I	0	’ she said , ‘
55435	55594	55597	55599	my good Cousin,—So	307	’ And she threw herself on the sofa , and hid her face in her hands . Yes , Argemone , it is come to this ; and the best thing you can do , is just what you are doing — to lie there and cry yourself to sleep , while the angels are laughing kindly ( if a solemn public , who settles everything for them , will permit them to laugh ) at the rickety old windmill of sham - Popery which you have taken for a real giant . At that same day and hour , as it chanced , Lancelot , little dreaming what the said windmill was grinding for him , was scribbling a hasty and angry answer to a letter of Luke ’s , which , perhaps , came that very morning in order to put him into a proper temper for the demolishing of windmills . It ran thus , — ‘
55603	56347	55597	55599	my good Cousin,—So	307	‘ Suave mari magno turbantibus æquora ventis E terra magnum alterius spectare laborem ... Pleasant and easy for you Protestants ( for I will call you what you are , in spite of your own denials , a truly consistent and logical Protestant — and therefore a Materialist)—easy for you , I say , to sit on the shore , in cold , cruel self - satisfaction , and tell the poor wretch buffeting with the waves what he ought to do while he is choking and drowning ... Thank Heaven , the storm has stranded me upon the everlasting Rock of Peter;—but it has been a sore trouble to reach it . Protestants , who look at creeds as things to be changed like coats , whenever they seem not to fit them , little know what we Catholic - hearted ones suffer ... If they did , they would be more merciful and more chary in the requirements of us , just as we are in the very throe of a new - born existence . The excellent man , to whose care I have committed myself , has a wise and a tender heart ... he saw no harm in my concealing from my father the spiritual reason of my giving up my curacy ( for I have given it up ) , and only giving the outward , but equally true reason , that I found it on the whole an ineligible and distressing post .... I know you will apply to such an act that disgusting monosyllable of which Protestants are so fond . He felt with me and for me — for my horror of giving pain to my father , and for my wearied and excited state of mind ; and strangely enough — to show how differently , according to the difference of the organs , the same object may appear to two people — he quoted in my favour that very verse which you wrest against me . He wished me to show my father that I had only changed my heaven , and not my character , by becoming an Ultramontane - Catholic ... that , as far as his esteem and affection were founded on anything in me , the ground of it did not vanish with my conversion . If I had told him at once of my altered opinions , he would have henceforth viewed every word and action with a perjudiced eye ... Protestants are so bigoted ... but if , after seeing me for a month or two the same Luke that he had ever known me , he were gradually informed that I had all the while held that creed which he had considered incompatible with such a life as I hope mine would be — you must see the effect which it ought to have ... I do n’t doubt that you will complain of all this ... All I can say is , that I can not sympathise with that superstitious reverence for mere verbal truth , which is so common among Protestants ... It seems to me they throw away the spirit of truth , in their idolatry of its letter . For instance,—what is the use of informing a man of a true fact but to induce a true opinion in him ? But if , by clinging to the exact letter of the fact , you create a false opinion in his mind , as I should do in my father ’s case , if by telling him at once of my change , I gave him an unjust horror of Catholicism,—you do not tell him the truth ... You may speak what is true to you,—but it becomes an error when received into his mind ... . If his mind is a refracting and polarising medium — if the crystalline lens of his soul ’s eye has been changed into tourmaline or Labrador spar — the only way to give him a true image of the fact , is to present it to him already properly altered in form , and adapted to suit the obliquity of his vision ; in order that the very refractive power of his faculties may , instead of distorting it , correct it , and make it straight for him ; and so a verbal wrong in fact may possess him with a right opinion ... ‘
56466	56483	56489	56489	Luke!—Well	308	’ To all which Lancelot , with several strong curses , scrawled the following answer : — ‘
56835	56877	56888	56891	the Reverend Panurgus O’Blareaway	272	‘ One word more — Unless you tell your father within twenty - four hours after receiving this letter , I will . And I , being a Protestant ( if cursing Popery means Protestantism ) , mean what I say . ’
57096	57101	57092	57092	he	172	‘ like a horse ; ’
57135	57141	57092	57092	he	172	‘ gift of the gab , ’

57192	57241	57183	57183	himself	172	‘ The top of the morning to ye , Mr. Smith . Ye have n’t such a thing as a cegar about ye ? I ’ve been preaching to school - children till me throat ’s as dry as the slave of a lime - burner ’s coat . ’
57242	57260	57312	57312	Lancelot	172	‘ I am very sorry ; but , really , I have left my case at home . ’
57261	57276	57183	57183	himself	172	‘ Oh ! ah ! faix and I forgot . Ye must n’t be smokin ’
57293	57298	57183	57183	himself	172	’re the lucky man ! ’
57299	57310	57312	57312	Lancelot	172	‘ I am much obliged to you for the compliment , ’
57316	57328	57312	57312	Lancelot	172	‘ but really I do n’t see how I deserve it . ’
57329	57380	57382	57382	she	1810	‘ Desarve it ! Sure luck ’s all , and that ’s your luck , and not your deserts at all . To have the handsomest girl in the county dying for love of ye’—(Panurgus had a happy knack of blurting out truths — when they were pleasant ones ) . ‘
57412	57413	57418	57418	O’Blareaway	272	’ ‘

And good luck to ye in that same , for ye’re as pretty a rider as ever kicked coping - stones out of a wall ; and poor Paddy loves a sportsman by nature . Och ! but ye’ve got a hand of trumps this time . Did n’t I mate the vicar the other day , and spake my mind to him ? ’
57544	57550	57552	57552	Lancelot	172	‘ What do you mean ? ’
57559	57618	57552	57552	Lancelot	172	‘ Faix , I told him he might as well Faugh a ballagh — make a rid road , and get out of that , with his bowings and his crossings , and his Popery made asy for small minds , for there was a gun a - field that would wipe his eye,—maning yourself , ye Prathestant . ’
57619	57643	57649	57653	the good - natured Irishman	312	‘ All I can say is , that you had really better mind your own business , and I ’ll mind my own . ’
57644	57647	57649	57653	the good - natured Irishman	312	‘ Och , ’
57655	57774	57649	57653	the good - natured Irishman	312	‘ and it ’s you must mind my business , and I ’ll mind yours ; and that ’s all fair and aqual . Ye’ve cut me out intirely at the Priory , ye Tory , and so ye’re bound to give me a lift somehow . Could n’t ye look me out a fine fat widow , with an illigant little fortune ? For what ’s England made for except to find poor Paddy a wife and money ? Ah , ye may laugh , but I ’d buy me a chapel at the West - end : me talents are thrown away here intirely , wasting me swateness on the desert air , as Tom Moore says ’

57805	57837	57795	57796	the boy	1359	’ Lancelot burst into a roar of laughter , and escaped over the next gate : but the Irishman ’s coarse hints stuck by him as they were intended to do . ‘
57845	57863	57649	57653	the good - natured Irishman	312	’ He knew it was an impudent exaggeration , but , somehow , it gave him confidence ; ‘
57869	57873	57649	57653	the good - natured Irishman	312	’ he thought , ‘
57877	57955	57956	57956	I	0	’ And his heart beat high with new hopes , for which he laughed at himself all the while . It was just the cordial which he needed . That conversation determined the history of his life . He met Argemone that morning in the library , as usual ; but he soon found that she was not thinking of Homer . She was moody and abstracted ; and he could not help at last saying , — ‘
57972	57973	57969	57970	Miss Lavington	189	’ ‘
57983	58017	57969	57970	Miss Lavington	189	’ She turned away her head . He fancied that it was to hide a tear . Suddenly she rose , and turned to him with a clear , calm , gentle gaze . ‘
58206	58233	58176	58204	a true and loyal knight to him who said—“Learn of me , for I am meek and lowly of heart , and ye shall find rest unto your souls!”—Ay	1817	’ she went on , more and more passionately , for she felt that not she , but One mightier than herself was speaking through her , ‘
58367	58431	58362	58365	a friend called Argemone	1822	’ She put into his hands a little Bible . He took it , and laid it down on the table . For a minute he stood silent and rooted to the spot . Disappointment , shame , rage , hatred , all boiled up madly within him . The bitterest insults rose to his lips—‘Flirt , cold - hearted pedant , fanatic ! ’
58532	58617	58618	58618	He	1825	‘ Yes , I will go . I have had mad dreams , conceited and insolent , and have met with my deserts . Brute and fool as I am , I have aspired even to you ! And I have gained , in the sunshine of your condescension , strength and purity.—Is not that enough for me ? And now I will show you that I love you — by obeying you . You tell me to depart — I go for ever . ’
58630	58677	58678	58678	He	1825	‘ Lancelot ! one word ! Do not misunderstand me , as I know you will . You will think me so cold , heartless , fickle.—Oh , you do not know — you never can know — how much I , too , have felt ! ’
58734	58759	58729	58729	he	1825	‘ I see — I see it all , Argemone ! We love each other ! You are mine , never to be parted ! ’
58805	58818	58791	58791	She	1828	‘ Oh , Lancelot , Lancelot , whither are you forcing me ? ’
58819	58852	58782	58782	his	1825	‘ I am forcing you no whither . God , the Father of spirits , is leading you ! You , who believe in Him , how dare you fight against Him ? ’
58853	58869	58871	58871	she	1828	‘ Lancelot , I cannot — I can not listen to you — read that ! ’
58896	59084	58879	58879	He	1829	‘ Wretched pedant ! Can your intellect be deluded by such barefaced sophistries ? “ God ’s will , ” forsooth ! And if your mother ’s opposition is not a sign that God ’s will — if it mean anything except your own will , or that — that man’s — is against this mad project , and not for it , what sign would you have ? So “ celibacy is the highest state ! ” And why ? Because “ it is the safest and the easiest road to heaven ? ” A pretty reason , vicar ! I should have thought that that was a sign of a lower state and not a higher . Noble spirits show their nobleness by daring the most difficult paths . And even if marriage was but one weed - field of temptations , as these miserable pedants say , who have either never tried it , or misused it to their own shame , it would be a greater deed to conquer its temptations than to flee from them in cowardly longings after ease and safety ! ’
59100	59240	59093	59093	her	1831	‘ Again , I say , Argemone , will you fight against Fate — Providence — God — call it what you will ? Who made us meet at the chapel ? Who made me , by my accident , a guest in your father ’s house ! Who put it into your heart to care for my poor soul ? Who gave us this strange attraction towards each other , in spite of our unlikeness ? Wonderful that the very chain of circumstances which you seem to fancy the offspring of chance or the devil , should have first taught me to believe that there is a God who guides us ! Argemone ! speak , tell me , if you will , to go for ever ; but tell me first the truth — You love me ! ’
59303	59308	59284	59284	she	1832	‘ I love you ! ’
59343	59348	59349	59349	she	1832	‘ Now , go , ’
59352	59384	59349	59349	she	1832	‘ go , and let me collect my thoughts . All this has been too much for me . Do not look sad — you may come again to - morrow . ’
59551	59555	59532	59532	her	1832	‘ bit of writing ’
59713	59761	59708	59708	Tregarva	173	‘ You have treated me , sir , as no one else has done — like a man and a friend ; but I am not going to make a market of your generosity . I will owe no man anything , save to love one another . ’
59762	59771	59773	59773	Lancelot	172	‘ But how do you intend to live ? ’
59783	59802	59773	59773	Lancelot	172	‘ There ’s enough of me , sir , to make a good navigator if all trades fail . ’
59803	59814	59708	59708	Tregarva	173	‘ Nonsense ! you must not throw yourself away so . ’
59815	59930	59708	59708	Tregarva	173	‘ Oh , sir , there ’s good to be done , believe me , among those poor fellows . They wander up and down the land like hogs and heathens , and no one tells them that they have a soul to be saved . Not one parson in a thousand gives a thought to them . They can manage old folks and little children , sir , but , somehow , they never can get hold of the young men — just those who want them most . There ’s a talk about ragged schools , now . Why do n’t they try ragged churches , sir , and a ragged service ? ’
59931	59937	59773	59773	Lancelot	172	‘ What do you mean ? ’
59938	60079	59708	59708	Tregarva	173	‘ Why , sir , the parsons are ready enough to save souls , but it must be only according to rule and regulation . Before the Gospel can be preached there must be three thousand pounds got together for a church , and a thousand for an endowment , not to mention the thousand pounds that the clergyman ’s education costs : I do n’t think of his own keep , sir ; that ’s little enough , often ; and those that work hardest get least pay , it seems to me . But after all that expense , when they ’ve built the church , it ’s the tradesmen , and the gentry , and the old folk that fill it , and the working men never come near it from one year ’s end to another . ’
60080	60090	60092	60092	Lancelot	172	‘ What ’s the cause , do you think ? ’
60105	60173	60096	60096	himself	172	‘ Half of the reason , sir , I do believe , is that same Prayer - book . Not that the Prayer - book ai n’t a fine book enough , and a true one ; but , do n’t you see , sir , to understand the virtue of it , the poor fellows ought to be already just what you want to make them . ’
60174	60194	59708	59708	Tregarva	173	‘ You mean that they ought to be thorough Christians already , to appreciate the spirituality of the liturgy . ’
60195	60320	59708	59708	Tregarva	173	‘ You ’ve hit it , sir . And see what comes of the present plan ; how a navvy drops into a church by accident , and there he has to sit like a fish out of water , through that hour ’s service , staring or sleeping , before he can hear a word that he understands ; and , sir , when the sermon does come at last , it ’s not many of them can make much out of those fine book - words and long sentences . Why do n’t they have a short simple service , now and then , that might catch the ears of the roughs and the blowens , without tiring out the poor thoughtless creatures ’
60328	60329	59708	59708	Tregarva	173	’ ‘
60332	60355	59708	59708	Tregarva	173	’ said Lancelot,—‘because — I really do n’t know why.—But I think there is a simpler plan than even a ragged service . ’
60356	60363	59708	59708	Tregarva	173	‘ What , then , sir ? ’
60364	60385	59708	59708	Tregarva	173	‘ Field - preaching . If the mountain wo n’t come to Mahomet , let Mahomet go to the mountain . ’
60386	60545	59708	59708	Tregarva	173	‘ Right , sir ; right you are . “ Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in . ” And why are they to speak to them only one by one ? Why not by the dozen and the hundred ? We Wesleyans know , sir,—for the matter of that , every soldier knows,—what virtue there is in getting a lot of men together ; how good and evil spread like wildfire through a crowd ; and one man , if you can stir him up , will become leaven to leaven the whole lump . Oh why , sir , are they so afraid of field - preaching ? Was not their Master and mine the prince of all field - preachers ? Think , if the Apostles had waited to collect subscriptions for a church before they spoke to the poor heathens , where should we have been now ? ’
60575	60602	60556	60557	a footman	1845	‘ Tregarva , master wants you in the study . And please , sir , I think you had better go in too ; master knows you ’re
60623	60624	60556	60557	a footman	1845	’ ‘
60633	60713	60625	60625	I	0	’ said Tregarva , quietly , as he followed Lancelot into the house . It had come at last . The squire was sitting in his study , purple with rage , while his daughters were trying vainly to pacify him . All the men - servants , grooms , and helpers , were drawn up in line along the wall , and greeted Tregarva , whom they all heartily liked , with sly and sorrowful looks of warning , ‘
60791	60846	60788	60788	you	172	’ And the squire , whose vocabulary was not large , at a loss for another synonym , rounded off his oration by a torrent of oaths ; at which Argemone , taking Honoria ’s hand , walked proudly out of the room , with one glance at Lancelot of mingled shame and love . ‘
60858	60872	60852	60852	you	172	’ ( and the squire tossed the fatal paper across the table ) ; ‘
60908	60909	60896	60898	all the servants	1854	’ ‘
60916	60922	60911	60911	your	172	’ interposed the old butler , ‘

60947	60951	60945	60945	mine	172	’ said Tregarva . ‘
61008	61009	61010	61010	I	0	’ ‘
61018	61022	61010	61010	I	0	’ answered Tregarva . ‘
61030	61056	61023	61023	I	0	’ he went on in a voice which made the old man start from his seat and clench his fist but he sat down again . ‘
61130	61131	61123	61123	I	0	’ ‘
61176	61236	61173	61173	I	0	’ Lancelot hesitated ; but the squire , who was utterly beside himself , began to swear at him also , as masters of hounds are privileged to do ; and Lancelot , to whom the whole scene was becoming every moment more and more intensely ludicrous , thought it best to take up the paper and begin : — ‘
61245	61271	61173	61173	I	0	‘ The merry brown hares came leaping Over the crest of the hill , Where the clover and corn lay sleeping Under the moonlight still . ‘
61304	61335	61336	61336	She	1868	‘ A poacher ’s widow sat sighing On the side of the white chalk bank , Where under the gloomy fir - woods One spot in the ley throve rank . ‘
61365	61396	61398	61398	I	0	‘ She thought of the dark plantation , And the hares and her husband ’s blood , And the voice of her indignation Rose up to the throne of God . ‘
61429	61465	61398	61398	I	0	‘ “ A labourer in Christian England , Where they ca nt of a Saviour ’s name , And yet waste men ’s lives like the vermin ’s For a few more brace of game . ‘
61509	61510	61511	61512	You villain	1852	’ ‘
61514	61519	61511	61512	You villain	1852	’ interposed the squire , ‘
61530	61531	61533	61533	You	1872	’ ‘
61570	61605	61533	61533	You	1872	‘ You made him a poacher yourself , squire , When you ’d give neither work nor meat ; And your barley - fed hares robbed the garden At our starving children ’s feet ; ‘
61645	61681	61682	61682	We	1886	‘ “ When we lay in the burning fever On the mud of the cold clay floor , Till you parted us all for three months , squire , At the cursed workhouse door . “ ‘
61718	61719	61722	61722	he	1889	’ ‘
61734	61775	61722	61722	he	1889	’ grumbled the old man . Tregarva winced a good deal — as if he knew what was coming next ; and then looked up relieved when he found Lancelot had omitted a stanza — which I shall not omit . ‘
61811	61841	61803	61804	Your misses	1892	‘ Can your lady patch hearts that are breaking With handfuls of coals and rice , Or by dealing out flannel and sheeting A little below cost price ? “ ‘
61878	61909	61916	61916	You	1888	‘ “ In the season of shame and sadness , In the dark and dreary day When scrofula , gout , and madness , Are eating your race away ; “ ‘
61921	61941	61916	61916	You	1888	’ bread ; And worn out with liquor and harlots , Your heir at your feet lies dead ; “ ‘
61978	62011	62013	62016	the merry brown hares	1904	‘ She looked at the tuft of clover , And wept till her heart grew light ; And at last , when her passion was over , Went wandering into the night . ‘
62040	62041	62013	62016	the merry brown hares	1904	’ ‘
62046	62050	62013	62016	the merry brown hares	1904	’ said Lancelot , ‘
62067	62068	62051	62051	you	753	’ ‘
62102	62120	62094	62095	the fellow	3970	’ continued he , quoting the only text in the Bible which he was inclined to make a ‘
62124	62125	62094	62095	the fellow	3970	’ ‘
62143	62144	62140	62140	I	0	’ ‘
62148	62154	62145	62145	I	0	’ quoth Lancelot , ambiguously , ‘
62179	62189	62174	62174	he	1914	’ and Lancelot stole an encouraging look at Tregarva . ‘
62196	62205	62191	62191	I	0	’ the keeper answered , with an effort , ‘
62223	62224	62207	62207	I	0	’ ‘
62235	62240	62227	62227	you	0	’ roared the squire . ‘
62272	62273	62260	62260	He	1918	’ ‘
62313	62375	62376	62376	he	0	’m going , sir ; I never harmed you , or meant a hard word of all this for you , or dreamt that you or any living soul would ever see it . But what I ’ve seen myself , in spite of myself , I ’ve set down here , and am not ashamed of it . And woe , ’
62433	62508	62512	62512	God	281	’ He turned to go . The squire , bursting with passion , sprang up with a terrible oath , turned deadly pale , staggered , and dropped senseless on the floor . They all rushed to lift him up . Tregarva was the first to take him in his arms and place him tenderly in his chair , where he lay back with glassy eyes , snoring heavily in a fit of apoplexy . ‘
62518	62525	62512	62512	God	281	’ whispered Lancelot to the keeper , ‘
62542	62935	62940	62940	he	3964	’ The keeper slipped away sadly . The ladies rushed in — a groom galloped off for the doctor — met him luckily in the village , and , in a few minutes , the squire was bled and put to bed , and showed hopeful signs of returning consciousness . And as Argemone and Lancelot leant together over his pillow , her hair touched her lover ’s , and her fragrant breath was warm upon his cheek ; and her bright eyes met his and drank light from them , like glittering planets gazing at their sun . The obnoxious ballad produced the most opposite effects on Argemone and on Honoria . Argemone , whose reverence for the formalities and the respectabilities of society , never very great , had , of late , utterly vanished before Lancelot ’s bad counsel , could think of it only as a work of art , and conceived the most romantic longing to raise Tregarva into some station where his talents might have free play . To Honoria , on the other hand , it appeared only as a very fierce , coarse , and impertinent satire , which had nearly killed her father . True , there was not a thought in it which had not at some time or other crossed her own mind ; but that made her dislike all the more to see those thoughts put into plain English . That very intense tenderness and excitability which made her toil herself among the poor , and had called out both her admiration of Tregarva and her extravagant passion at his danger , made her also shrink with disgust from anything which thrust on her a painful reality , which she could not remedy . She was a staunch believer , too , in that peculiar creed which allows every one to feel for the poor , except themselves , and considers that to plead the cause of working - men is , in a gentleman , the perfection of virtue , but in a working - man himself , sheer high treason . And so beside her father ’s sick - bed she thought of the keeper only as a scorpion whom she had helped to warm into life ; and sighing assent to her mother , when she said , ‘
62960	63109	63110	63110	I	0	’ she let him vanish from her mind and out of Whitford Priors , little knowing the sore weight of manly love he bore with him . As soon as Lancelot could leave the Priory , he hastened home to find Tregarva . The keeper had packed up all his small possessions and brought them down to Lower Whitford , through which the London coach passed . He was determined to go to London and seek his fortune . He talked of turning coal - heaver , Methodist preacher , anything that came to hand , provided that he could but keep independence and a clear conscience . And all the while the man seemed to be struggling with some great purpose,—to feel that he had a work to do , though what it was , and how it was to be done , he did not see . ‘
63116	63120	63112	63114	a tall man	1930	’ he said , ‘
63160	63161	63148	63148	I	0	’ ‘
63165	63171	63148	63148	I	0	’ said Lancelot , laughing , ‘
63177	63178	63148	63148	I	0	’ ‘
63198	63213	63192	63192	God	281	’m much mistaken if I do n’t begin to see my way towards another . ’
63214	63220	63197	63197	I	0	‘ And what is that ? ’
63221	63250	63253	63253	his	172	‘ The kingdom of God on earth , sir , as well as in heaven . Come it must , sir , and come it will some day . ’
63265	63308	63256	63256	Tregarva	173	‘ Are we not taught to pray for the coming of His kingdom , sir ? And do you fancy that He who gave the lesson would have set all mankind to pray for what He never meant should come to pass ? ’
63325	63328	63329	63329	he	172	‘ Well , ’
63332	63391	63329	63329	he	172	‘ the time , at least , of their fulfilment is far enough off . Union - workhouses and child - murder do n’t look much like it . Talking of that , Tregarva , what is to become of your promise to take me to a village wake , and show me what the poor are like ? ’
63392	63426	63485	63485	I	0	‘ I can keep it this night , sir . There is a revel at Bone - sake , about five miles up the river . Will you go with a discharged gamekeeper ? ’
63427	63483	63485	63485	I	0	‘ I will go with Paul Tregarva , whom I honour and esteem as one of God ’s own noblemen ; who has taught me what a man can be , and what I am not,’—and Lancelot grasped the keeper ’s hand warmly . Tregarva brushed his hand across his eyes , and answered , — ‘
63559	63894	64108	64108	Heaven	215	’ So the expedition was agreed on , and Lancelot and the keeper parted until the evening . But why had the vicar been rambling on all that morning through pouring rain , on the top of the London coach ? And why was he so anxious in his inquiries as to the certainty of catching the up - train ? Because he had had considerable experience in that wisdom of the serpent , whose combination with the innocence of the dove , in somewhat ultramontane proportions , is recommended by certain late leaders of his school . He had made up his mind , after his conversation with the Irishman , that he must either oust Lancelot at once , or submit to be ousted by him , and he was now on his way to Lancelot ’s uncle and trustee , the London banker . He knew that the banker had some influence with his nephew , whose whole property was invested in the bank , and who had besides a deep respect for the kindly and upright practical mind of the veteran Mammonite . And the vicar knew , too , that he himself had some influence with the banker , whose son Luke had been his pupil at college . And when the young man lay sick of a dangerous illness , brought on by debauchery , into which weakness rather than vice had tempted him , the vicar had watched and prayed by his bed , nursed him as tenderly as a mother , and so won over his better heart that he became completely reclaimed , and took holy orders with the most earnest intention to play the man therein , as repentant rakes will often do , half from a mere revulsion to asceticism , half from real gratitude for their deliverance . This good deed had placed the banker in the vicar ’s debt , and he loved and reverenced him in spite of his dread of ‘
63898	64086	64108	64108	Heaven	215	’ And now the good priest was going to open to him just as much of his heart as should seem fit ; and by saying a great deal about Lancelot ’s evil doings , opinions , and companions , and nothing at all about the heiress of Whitford , persuade the banker to use all his influence in drawing Lancelot up to London , and leaving a clear stage for his plans on Argemone . He caught the up - train , he arrived safe and sound in town , but what he did there must be told in another chapter . Weary with many thoughts , the vicar came to the door of the bank . There were several carriages there , and a crowd of people swarming in and out , like bees round a hive - door , entering with anxious faces , and returning with cheerful ones , to stop and talk earnestly in groups round the door . Every moment the mass thickened — there was a run on the bank . An old friend accosted him on the steps , — ‘
64099	64100	64090	64090	you	1941	’ ‘
64110	64115	64090	64090	you	1941	’ said the vicar . ‘
64121	64122	64125	64125	you	1941	’ ‘
64167	64168	64155	64155	we	1944	’ ‘
64180	64181	64155	64155	we	1944	’ ‘
64204	64265	64200	64200	I	0	’ And the good man bustled off with his pockets full of gold . The vicar entered . All was hurry and anxiety . The clerks seemed trying to brazen out their own terror , and shovelled the rapidly lessening gold and notes across the counter with an air of indignant nonchalance . The vicar asked to see the principal . ‘
64274	64284	64200	64200	I	0	’ answered the official , with a disdainful look . ‘
64302	64303	64293	64294	Mr. Smith	137	’ ‘
64309	64310	64311	64311	I	0	’ ‘
64336	64422	64330	64330	he	137	’ A new vista had opened itself before him . He was ushered into a private room : and , as he waited for the banker , he breathed a prayer . For what ? That his own will might be done — a very common style of petition . Mr. Smith entered , hurried and troubled . He caught the vicar eagerly by the hand , as if glad to see a face which did not glare on him with the cold selfish stamp of ‘
64425	64464	64465	64465	I	0	’ and then drew back again , afraid to commit himself by any sign of emotion . The vicar had settled his plan of attack , and determined boldly to show his knowledge of the banker ’s distress . ‘
64495	64507	64481	64481	I	0	’ ( He knew the banker was a stout Churchman . ) ‘
64522	64523	64519	64519	I	0	’ ‘
64546	64547	64534	64534	I	0	’ ‘
64555	64567	64568	64568	I	0	’ interrupted Mr. Smith , in a peevish , excited tone . ‘
64625	64626	64605	64605	your	1949	’ ‘
64632	64639	64642	64642	sir	753	’ asked the vicar , slowly . ‘
64674	64695	64664	64664	you	753	’ The vicar stared fixedly at him a moment , and burst into honest tears . The banker was moved . ‘
64696	64743	64745	64745	he	753	’ Pon my honour , sir , I beg your pardon . I did not mean to be rude , but — but — To be plain with a clergyman , sir , so many things coming together have quite unmanned me . Pooh , pooh , ’
64771	64784	64745	64745	he	753	‘ And now , my dear sir , what of my nephew ? ’
64785	64834	64745	64745	he	753	‘ As for that young lady , sir , of whom you spoke , I can assure you , once for all , as her clergyman , and therefore more or less her confidant , that your nephew has not the slightest chance or hope in that quarter . ’
64835	64849	64745	64745	he	753	‘ How , sir ? You will not throw obstacles in the way ? ’
64850	64912	64745	64745	he	753	‘ Heaven , sir , I think , has interposed far more insuperable obstacles — in the young lady ’s own heart — than I could ever have done . Your nephew ’s character and opinions , I am sorry to say , are not such as are likely to command the respect and affection of a pure and pious Churchwoman . ’
64913	64927	64745	64745	he	753	‘ Opinions , sir ? What , is he turning Papist , too ? ’
64928	65024	64745	64745	he	753	‘ I am afraid , sir , and more than afraid , for he makes no secret of it himself , that his views tend rather in the opposite direction ; to an infidelity so subversive of the commonest principles of morality , that I expect , weekly , to hear of some unblushing and disgraceful outrage against decency , committed by him under its fancied sanction . And you know , as well as myself , the double danger of some profligate outbreak , which always attends the miseries of a disappointed earthly passion . ’
65025	65051	64745	64745	he	753	‘ True , very true . We must get the boy out of the way , sir . I must have him under my eye . ’
65052	65058	65060	65071	the subtle vicar , who had been driving at this very point	1961	‘ Exactly so , sir , ’
65073	65120	65060	65071	the subtle vicar , who had been driving at this very point	1961	‘ How much better for him to be here , using his great talents to the advantage of his family in an honourable profession , than to remain where he is , debauching body and mind by hopeless dreams , godless studies , and frivolous excesses . ’
65121	65129	64745	64745	he	753	‘ When do you return , sir ? ’
65130	65144	65145	65146	The banker	1279	‘ An hour hence , if I can be of service to you . ’
65151	65156	65145	65146	The banker	1279	‘ You are a gentleman ’
65165	65174	65145	65146	The banker	1279	‘ and as such I can trust you . ’
65175	65184	64745	64745	he	753	‘ Say , rather , as a clergyman . ’
65185	65283	64745	64745	he	753	‘ Pardon me , but I have found your cloth give little additional cause for confidence . I have been as much bitten by clergymen — I have seen as sharp practice among them , in money matters as well as in religious squabbles , as I have in any class . Whether it is that their book education leaves them very often ignorant of the plain rules of honour which bind men of the world , or whether their zeal makes them think that the end justifies the means , I can not tell ; but — ’
65284	65287	65289	65290	the vicar	3366	‘ But , ’
65298	65309	65289	65290	the vicar	3366	‘ you must not disparage the priesthood before a priest . ’
65310	65381	65382	65383	The vicar	3366	‘ I know it , I know it ; and I beg your pardon : but if you knew the cause I have to complain . The slipperiness , sir , of one staggering parson , has set rolling this very avalanche , which gathers size every moment , and threatens to overwhelm me now , unless that idle dog Lancelot will condescend to bestir himself , and help me . ’
65390	65400	65401	65401	he	3366	‘ Me , at least , you can trust , ’
65450	65456	65433	65434	the banker	1279	‘ Thou art the man ! ’
65457	65464	65467	65468	Mr. Smith	137	‘ When do you go down ? ’
65470	65524	65525	65526	The vicar	3366	‘ To tell you the truth , I was writing to Lancelot when you were announced ! but the post will not reach him till to - morrow at noon , and we are all so busy here , that I have no one whom I can trust to carry down an express . ’
65543	65552	65534	65534	his	3366	‘ Why not send a parcel by rail ? ’
65553	65583	65433	65434	the banker	1279	‘ I can trust the rail as far as D — ; but I can not trust those coaches . If you could do me so great a kindness — ’
65584	65610	65534	65534	his	3366	‘ I will . I can start by the one o’clock train , and by ten o’clock to - night I shall be in Whitford . ’
65611	65616	65534	65534	his	3366	‘ Are you certain ? ’
65617	65627	65433	65434	the banker	1279	‘ If God shall please , I am certain . ’
65628	65710	65534	65534	his	3366	‘ And you will take charge of a letter ? Perhaps , too , you could see him yourself ; and tell him — you see I trust you with everything — that my fortune , his own fortune , depends on his being here to - morrow morning . He must start to - night , sir — to - night , tell him , if there were twenty Miss Lavingtons in Whitford — or he is a ruined man ! ’
65748	65751	65753	65753	he	781	‘ Well , ’
65757	65843	65753	65753	he	781	‘ God has indeed blessed my errand ; giving , as always , “ exceeding abundantly more than we are able to ask or think ! ” For some weeks , at least , this poor lamb is safe from the destroyer ’s clutches . I must improve to the utmost those few precious days in strengthening her in her holy purpose . But , after all , he will return , daring and cunning as ever ; and then will not the fascination recommence ? ’
65859	65874	65850	65852	a little fiend	1973	‘ Unless he comes up to - night , he is a ruined man . ’
65954	65957	65958	65958	he	781	‘ Ay , ’
65961	66045	65958	65958	he	781	‘ if he were ruined , after all , it would be well for God ’s cause . The Lavingtons , at least , would find no temptation in his wealth : and Argemone — she is too proud , too luxurious , to marry a beggar . She might embrace a holy poverty for the sake of her own soul ; but for the gratification of an earthly passion , never ! Base and carnal delights would never tempt her so far . ’
66090	66105	66084	66086	the little fiend	1977	‘ Unless he comes up to - night , he is a ruined man . ’
66106	66113	66115	66116	the vicar	3366	‘ And what if he is ? ’
66118	66184	66115	66116	the vicar	3366	‘ Riches are a curse ; and poverty a blessing . Is it not his wealth which is ruining his soul ? Idleness and fulness of bread have made him what he is — a luxurious and self - willed dreamer , battening on his own fancies . Were it not rather a boon to him to take from him the root of all evil ? ’
66269	66283	66263	66265	the little fiend	1977	‘ Unless he comes up to - night he is a ruined man . ’
66298	66302	66304	66306	the inner voice	1985	‘ You promised , ’
66308	66372	66304	66306	the inner voice	1985	‘ No , I did not promise exactly , in so many words ; that is , I only said I would be at home to - night , if God pleased . And what if God should not please?—I promised for his good . What if , on second thoughts , it should be better for him not to keep my promise ? ’
66427	66462	66419	66420	the fiend	1990	‘ And what if he be ruined ? Look at the thousands who have , and are miserable — at the millions who have not , and are no sadder than their own tyrants . ’
66651	66659	66660	66660	he	1977	‘ Not that I care for detection , ’
66665	66778	66660	66660	he	1977	‘ What is shame to me ? Is it not a glory to be evil - spoken of in the cause of God ? How can the world appreciate the motives of those who are not of the world?—the divine wisdom of the serpent — at once the saint ’s peculiar weapon , and a part of his peculiar cross , when men call him a deceiver , because they confound , forsooth , his spiritual subtlety with their earthly cunning . Have I not been called “ liar , ” “ hypocrite , ” “ Jesuit , ” often enough already , to harden me towards bearing that name once again ? ’

66812	66834	66660	66660	he	1977	’ and then the remembrance of poor Luke Smith flashed across him for the first time since he left the bank . ‘
66840	66846	66835	66835	I	0	’ he said to himself ; ‘
66876	67028	67029	67029	You	1999	’ And then he remembered that his way home lay through the city in which the new convert ’s parish was — that the coach stopped there to change horses ; and again the temptation leapt up again , stronger than ever , under the garb of an imperative call of duty . He made no determination for or against it . He was too weak in body and mind to resist ; and in a half sleep , broken with an aching , terrified sense of something wanting which he could not find , he was swept down the line , got on the coach , and mechanically , almost without knowing it , found himself set down at the city of A — , and the coach rattling away down the street . He sprang from his stupor , and called madly after it — ran a few steps — ‘
67041	67046	67029	67029	You	1999	’ said the ostler . ‘
67058	67176	67177	67177	My	0	’ Alas ! so thought the vicar . But it was too late ; and , with a heavy heart , he asked the way to the late curate ’s house . Thither he went . Mr. Luke Smith was just at dinner , but the vicar was , nevertheless , shown into the bachelor ’s little dining - room . But what was his disgust and disappointment at finding his late pupil tête - à - tête over a comfortable fish - dinner , opposite a burly , vulgar , cunning - eyed man , with a narrow rim of muslin turned down over his stiff cravat , of whose profession there could be no doubt . ‘
67181	67196	67177	67177	My	0	’ said the new convert , springing up with an air of extreme empressement , ‘
67215	67223	67203	67203	me	0	’ The padre rose , bowed obsequiously , ‘
67243	67326	67203	67203	me	0	’ sat down again , and poured himself out a bumper of sherry ; while the vicar commenced making the best of a bad matter by joining in the now necessary business of eating . He had not a word to say for himself . Poor Luke was particularly jovial and flippant , and startlingly unlike his former self . The padre went on staring out of the window , and talking in a loud forced tone about the astonishing miracles of the ‘
67328	67330	67203	67203	me	0	’ and ‘
67333	67439	67203	67203	me	0	’ and the poor vicar , finding the purpose for which he had sacrificed his own word of honour utterly frustrated by the priest ’s presence , sat silent and crestfallen the whole evening . The priest had no intention of stirring . The late father - confessor tried to outstay his new rival , but in vain ; the padre deliberately announced his intention of taking a bed , and the vicar , with a heavy heart , rose to go to his inn . As he went out at the door , he caught an opportunity of saying one word to the convert . ‘
67460	67461	67454	67454	God	281	’ ‘
67497	67526	67527	67527	You	137	’ The vicar sighed , for the speech was evidently meant as a gentle rebuke to himself . But the young man ran on , half laughing , — ‘
67614	67615	67595	67596	The padre	4613	’ ‘
67622	67629	67595	67596	The padre	4613	’ said the vicar , bitterly . ‘
67632	67636	67595	67596	The padre	4613	’ answered Luke . ‘
67672	67673	67663	67663	We	2007	’ ‘
67681	67833	67679	67679	God	281	’ said the vicar ; all the more fiercely because he was almost at that moment of the young man ’s opinion . The vicar stepped out into the night . The rain , which had given place during the afternoon to a bright sun and clear chilly evening , had returned with double fury . The wind was sweeping and howling down the lonely streets , and lashed the rain into his face , while gray clouds were rushing past the moon like terrified ghosts across the awful void of the black heaven . Above him gaunt poplars groaned and bent , like giants cowering from the wrath of Heaven , yet rooted by grim necessity to their place of torture . The roar and tumult without him harmonised strangely with the discord within . He staggered and strode along the plashy pavement , muttering to himself at intervals , — ‘
67977	68199	67964	67964	they	2018	’ Certainly , vicar . If peace of mind be the summum bonum , and religion is merely the science of self - satisfaction , they are right ; and your wisest plan will be to follow them at once , or failing that , to apply to the next best substitute that can be discovered — alcohol and opium . As he went on , talking wildly to himself , he passed the Union Workhouse . Opposite the gate , under the lee of a wall , some twenty men , women , and children , were huddled together on the bare ground . They had been refused lodging in the workhouse , and were going to pass the night in that situation . As he came up to them , coarse jests , and snatches of low drinking - songs , ghastly as the laughter of lost spirits in the pit , mingled with the feeble wailings of some child of shame . The vicar recollected how he had seen the same sight at the door of Kensington Workhouse , walking home one night in company with Luke Smith ; and how , too , he had commented to him on that fearful sign of the times , and had somewhat unfairly drawn a contrast between the niggard cruelty of ‘
68203	68207	67964	67964	they	2018	’ and the fancied ‘
68214	68439	67964	67964	they	2018	’ What wonder if his pupil had taken him at his word ? Delighted to escape from his own thoughts by anything like action , he pulled out his purse to give an alms . There was no silver in it , but only some fifteen or twenty sovereigns , which he that day received as payment for some bitter reviews in a leading religious periodical . Everything that night seemed to shame and confound him more . As he touched the money , there sprang up in his mind in an instant the thought of the articles which had procured it ; by one of those terrible , searching inspirations , in which the light which lighteth every man awakes as a lightning - flash of judgment , he saw them , and his own heart , for one moment , as they were;—their blind prejudice ; their reckless imputations of motives ; their wilful concealment of any palliating clauses ; their party nicknames , given without a shudder at the terrible accusations which they conveyed . And then the indignation , the shame , the reciprocal bitterness which those articles would excite , tearing still wider the bleeding wounds of that Church which they professed to defend ! And then , in this case , too , the thought rushed across him , ‘
68519	68780	68508	68508	God	281	’ And the coins seemed to him like the price of blood — he fancied that he felt them red - hot to his hand , and , in his eagerness to get rid of the accursed thing , he dealt it away fiercely to the astonished group , amid whining and flattery , wrangling and ribaldry ; and then , not daring to wait and see the use to which his money would be put , hurried off to the inn , and tried in uneasy slumbers to forget the time , until the mail passed through at daybreak on its way to Whitford . At dusk that same evening the two had started for the village fair . A velveteen shooting - jacket , a pair of corduroy trousers , and a waistcoat , furnished by Tregarva , covered with flowers of every imaginable hue , tolerably disguised Lancelot , who was recommended by his conductor to keep his hands in his pockets as much as possible , lest their delicacy , which was , as it happened , not very remarkable , might betray him . As they walked together along the plashy turnpike road , overtaking , now and then , groups of two or three who were out on the same errand as themselves , Lancelot could not help remarking to the keeper how superior was the look of comfort in the boys and young men , with their ruddy cheeks and smart dresses , to the worn and haggard appearance of the elder men . ‘
68788	68792	68508	68508	God	281	’ said Tregarva ; ‘

69187	69237	69177	69179	the German peasantry	2043	’em , sir ? From the plough - tail to the reaping - hook , and back again , is all they know . Besides , sir , they are not like us Cornish ; they are a stupid pigheaded generation at the best , these south countrymen . They ’re

69345	69349	69319	69321	a heathen savage	2050	’ said Lancelot . ‘

69826	70009	69822	69822	he	753	‘ it ’s God ’s mercy that they dare n’t think . It ’s God ’s mercy that they do n’t feel . Men that write books and talk at elections call this a free country , and say that the poorest and meanest has a free opening to rise and become prime minister , if he can . But you see , sir , the misfortune is , that in practice he ca n’t ; for one who gets into a gentleman ’s family , or into a little shop , and so saves a few pounds , fifty know that they ’ve no chance before them , but day - labourer born , day - labourer live , from hand to mouth , scraping and pinching to get not meat and beer even , but bread and potatoes ; and then , at the end of it all , for a worthy reward , half - a - crown a - week of parish pay — or the workhouse . That ’s a lively hopeful prospect for a Christian man ! ’
70010	70013	70015	70015	Lancelot	172	‘ But , ’
70017	70033	70015	70015	Lancelot	172	‘ I thought this New Poor - law was to stir them up to independence ? ’
70034	70074	69822	69822	he	753	‘ Oh , sir , the old law has bit too deep : it made them slaves and beggars at heart . It taught them not to be ashamed of parish pay — to demand it as a right . ’
70075	70083	70085	70085	Lancelot	172	‘ And so it is their right , ’
70087	70121	70085	70085	Lancelot	172	‘ In God ’s name , if a country is so ill - constituted that it can not find its own citizens in work , it is bound to find them in food . ’
70122	70200	69822	69822	he	753	‘ Maybe , sir , maybe . God knows I do n’t grudge it them . It ’s a poor pittance at best , when they have got it . But do n’t you see , sir , how all poor - laws , old or new either , suck the independent spirit out of a man ; how they make the poor wretch reckless ; how they tempt him to spend every extra farthing in amusement ? ’
70201	70205	69822	69822	he	753	‘ How then ? ’
70206	70334	70085	70085	Lancelot	172	‘ Why , he is always tempted to say to himself , “ Whatever happens to me , the parish must keep me . If I am sick it must doctor me ; if I am worn out it must feed me ; if I die it must bury me ; if I leave my children paupers the parish must look after them , and they ’ll be as well off with the parish as they were with me . Now they ’ve only got just enough to keep body and soul together , and the parish ca n’t give them less than that . What ’s the use of cutting myself off from sixpenny - worth of pleasure here , and sixpenny - worth there . I ’m

70393	70404	70406	70406	Lancelot	172	‘ I do n’t see my way out of it , ’
70408	70494	70406	70406	Lancelot	172	‘ So says everybody , sir . But I should have thought those members of parliament , and statesmen , and university scholars have been set up in the high places , out of the wood where we are all struggling and scrambling , just that they might see their way out of it ; and if they do n’t , sir , and that soon , as sure as God is in heaven , these poor fellows will cut their way out of it . ’
70495	70504	70506	70506	Lancelot	172	‘ And blindfolded and ignorant as they are , ’
70508	70524	70506	70506	Lancelot	172	‘ they will be certain to cut their way out just in the wrong direction . ’

70600	70612	70506	70506	Lancelot	172	‘ Why , you are talking like any Chartist , Tregarva ! ’
70613	70652	70698	70699	my witness	2085	‘ Am I , sir ? I have n’t heard much Scripture quoted among them myself , poor fellows ; but to tell you the truth , sir , I do n’t know what I am becoming . I ’m

And , sir , these free - schools , and these penny - clubs , and clothing clubs , and these heaps of money which are given away , all make the matter worse and worse . They make the labourer fancy that he is not to depend upon God and his own right hand , but on what his wife can worm out of the good nature of the rich . Why , sir , they growl as insolently now at the parson or the squire ’s wife if they do n’t get as much money as their neighbours , as they used to at the parish vestrymen under the old law . Look at that Lord Vieuxbois , sir , as sweet a gentleman as ever God made . It used to do me good to walk behind him when he came over here shooting , just to hear the gentle kind - hearted way in which he used to speak to every old soul he met . He spends his whole life and time about the poor , I hear . But , sir , as sure as you live he ’s making his people slaves and humbugs . He does n’t see , sir , that they want to be raised bodily out of this miserable hand - to - mouth state , to be brought nearer up to him , and set on a footing where they can shift for themselves . Without meaning it , sir , all his boundless charities are keeping the people down , and telling them they must stay down , and not help themselves , but wait for what he gives them . He fats prize - labourers , sir , just as Lord Minchampstead fats prize - oxen and pigs . ’

71778	71823	71776	71776	Lancelot	172	‘ to make the people constantly and visibly comprehend that property is their protector and their friend , but I question whether it will suit the people themselves , unless they can make property understand that it owes them something more definite than protection . ’
72095	72104	72106	72106	Lancelot	172	‘ There seems very little here to see , ’
72111	72117	72106	72106	Lancelot	172	‘ I think , sir , ’
72121	72132	72106	72106	Lancelot	172	‘ that very thing is what ’s most worth seeing . ’

72281	72345	72276	72277	The keeper	3350	‘ You see those little creatures dragging home babies in arms nearly as big as themselves , sir . That and bad food , want of milk especially , accounts for their growing up no bigger than they do ; and as for their sad countenances , sir , most of them must carry a lighter conscience before they carry a brighter face . ’
72346	72352	72354	72354	Lancelot	172	‘ What do you mean ? ’
72356	72402	72276	72277	The keeper	3350	‘ The clergyman who enters the weddings and the baptisms knows well enough what I mean , sir . But we ’ll go into that booth , if you want to see the thick of it , sir ; that ’s to say , if you ’re

72474	72609	72610	72611	My Brethren	2156	’ This was caused by a violent blow across the shins with a thick stick , the deed of certain drunken wiseacres who were persisting in playing in the dark the never very lucrative game of three sticks a penny , conducted by a couple of gipsies . Poor fellows ! there was one excuse for them . It was the only thing there to play at , except a set of skittles ; and on those they had lost their money every Saturday night for the last seven years each at his own village beer - shop . So into the booth they turned ; and as soon as Lancelot ’s eyes were accustomed to the reeking atmosphere , he saw seated at two long temporary tables of board , fifty or sixty of ‘
72613	72747	72610	72611	My Brethren	2156	’ as clergymen call them in their sermons , wrangling , stupid , beery , with sodden eyes and drooping lips — interspersed with more girls and brazen - faced women , with dirty flowers in their caps , whose whole business seemed to be to cast jealous looks at each other , and defend themselves from the coarse overtures of their swains . Lancelot had been already perfectly astonished at the foulness of language which prevailed ; and the utter absence of anything like chivalrous respect , almost of common decency , towards women . But lo ! the language of the elder women was quite as disgusting as that of the men , if not worse . He whispered a remark on the point to Tregarva , who shook his head . ‘
72826	72827	72831	72831	they	2158	’ ‘

72951	72962	72949	72949	sir	753	’ he added , in a tone of deep feeling , ‘
72989	73103	72949	72949	sir	753	’ Lancelot looked round the booth with a hopeless feeling . There was awkward dancing going on at the upper end . He was too much sickened to go and look at it . He began examining the faces and foreheads of the company , and was astonished at the first glance by the lofty and ample development of brain in at least one half . There were intellects there — or rather capacities of intellect , capable , surely , of anything , had not the promise of the brow been almost always belied by the loose and sensual lower features . They were evidently rather a degraded than an undeveloped race . ‘
73113	73117	72949	72949	sir	753	’ thought Lancelot , ‘
73216	73217	73196	73196	you	173	’ ‘

73302	73359	73270	73270	you	753	’ Lancelot was rebuked , but not surprised . He had been for some time past suspecting , from the bitter experience of his own heart , the favourite modern theory which revives the Neo - Platonism of Alexandria , by making intellect synonymous with virtue , and then jumbling , like poor bewildered Proclus , the ‘
73362	73369	73377	73377	You	753	’ of the brain with the pure ‘
73371	73376	73377	73377	You	753	’ of the spirit . ‘

73480	73524	73529	73529	Tregarva	173	’ It was too true . Lancelot recollected now having remarked it before when at church ; and having wondered why almost all the youths were so much smaller , clumsier , lower - brained , and weaker - jawed than their elders . ‘
73531	73532	73529	73529	Tregarva	173	’ ‘
73545	73589	73544	73544	I	0	’m sore afraid , worse blood . There was too much filthiness and drunkenness went on in the old war - times , not to leave a taint behind it , for many a generation . The prosperity of fools shall destroy them ! ’
73590	73593	73595	73595	Lancelot	172	‘ Oh ! ’
73597	73645	73595	73595	Lancelot	172	‘ for some young sturdy Lancashire or Lothian blood , to put new life into the old frozen South Saxon veins ! Even a drop of the warm enthusiastic Celtic would be better than none . Perhaps this Irish immigration may do some good , after all . ’

74016	74020	73970	73970	they	2205	’ thought Lancelot , ‘
74032	74058	73970	73970	they	2205	’ And a pedlar who sat next him , a bold , black - whiskered bully , from the Potteries , hazarded a joke , — ‘
74112	74136	74150	74150	they	2205	’ This garland of fancies was received with great applause ; whereat the pedlar , emboldened , proceeded to observe , mysteriously , that ‘

74207	74214	74189	74189	you	2208	’ asked some one , querulously . ‘

74283	74455	74456	74456	He	2217	’ Lancelot heard many more scraps of this sort . He was very much struck with their dread of violence . It did not seem cowardice . It was not loyalty — the English labourer has fallen below the capability of so spiritual a feeling ; Lancelot had found out that already . It could not be apathy , for he heard nothing but complaint upon complaint bandied from mouth to mouth the whole evening . They seemed rather sunk too low in body and mind,—too stupefied and spiritless , to follow the example of the manufacturing districts ; above all , they were too ill - informed . It is not mere starvation which goads the Leicester weaver to madness . It is starvation with education,—an empty stomach and a cultivated , even though miscultivated , mind . At that instant , a huge hulking farm - boy rolled into the booth , roaring , dolefully , the end of a song , with a punctuation of his own invention — ‘
74492	74549	74592	74592	God	281	’ Lancelot would have laughed heartily at him anywhere else ; but the whole scene was past a jest ; and a gleam of pathos and tenderness seemed to shine even from that doggerel,—a vista , as it were , of true genial nature , in the far distance . But as he looked round again , ‘
74553	74557	74592	74592	God	281	’ he thought , ‘
74594	74615	74592	74592	God	281	’ The ursine howls of the new - comer seemed to have awakened the spirit of music in the party . ‘

Lancelot was sickened , and rose to go . As he turned , his arm was seized suddenly and firmly . He looked round , and saw a coarse , handsome , showily - dressed girl , looking intently into his face . He shook her angrily off . ‘

76039	76050	76009	76009	I	0	’ she cried , wildly , clapping her hands together ; ‘
76094	76095	76090	76090	you	0	’ ‘

76137	76202	76203	76203	He	137	’ She turned and vanished among the crowd . Lancelot almost ran out into the night,—into a triad of fights , two drunken men , two jealous wives , and a brute who struck a poor , thin , worn - out woman , for trying to coax him home . Lancelot rushed up to interfere , but a man seized his uplifted arm . ‘

76235	76239	76218	76218	She	2256	’ said Tregarva ; ‘

76396	76421	76342	76346	the stronger demon of Money	2268	’ rang through the air over their heads , and was answered by a like cry , faint and distant , across the wolds . ‘

76924	76931	77081	77081	he	2290	‘ But how came you here ? ’
76932	77080	77081	77081	he	2290	‘ The doctor told my father , and me too , sir , that we must give up mining , or die of decline : so he came up here , to a sister of his that was married to the squire ’s gardener , and here he died ; and the squire , God bless him and forgive him , took a fancy to me , and made me under - keeper . And I loved the life , for it took me among the woods and the rivers , where I could think of the Brazils , and fancy myself back again . But must n’t talk of that — where God wills is all right . And it is a fine life for reading and thinking , a gamekeeper ’s , for it ’s an idle life at best . Now that ’s over , ’
77088	77115	77081	77081	he	2290	‘ and the Lord has fulfilled His words to me , that He spoke the first night that ever I heard a stone - plover cry . ’
77116	77124	77126	77126	Lancelot	172	‘ What on earth can you mean ? ’
77131	77202	77126	77126	Lancelot	172	‘ Why , sir , it was a wild , whirling gray night , with the air full of sleet and rain , and my father sent me over to Redruth town to bring home some trade or other . And as I came back I got blinded with the sleet , and I lost my way across the moors . You know those Cornish furze - moors , sir ? ’
77203	77206	77081	77081	he	2290	‘ No . ’
77207	77428	77081	77081	he	2290	‘ Well , then , they are burrowed like a rabbit - warren with old mine - shafts . You ca n’t go in some places ten yards without finding great , ghastly black holes , covered in with furze , and weeds , and bits of rotting timber ; and when I was a boy I could n’t keep from them . Something seemed to draw me to go and peep down , and drop pebbles in , to hear them rattle against the sides , fathoms below , till they plumped into the ugly black still water at the bottom . And I used to be always after them in my dreams , when I was young , falling down them , down , down , all night long , till I woke screaming ; for I fancied they were hell ’s mouth , every one of them . And it stands to reason , sir ; we miners hold that the lake of fire ca n’t be far below . For we find it grow warmer , and warmer , and warmer , the farther we sink a shaft ; and the learned gentlemen have proved , sir , that it ’s not the blasting powder , nor the men ’s breaths , that heat the mine . ’
77434	77683	77081	77081	he	2290	‘ Well , sir , I got into a great furze - croft , full of deads ( those are the earth - heaps they throw out of the shafts ) , where no man in his senses dare go forward or back in the dark , for fear of the shafts ; and the wind and the snow were so sharp , they made me quite stupid and sleepy ; and I knew if I stayed there I should be frozen to death , and if I went on , there were the shafts ready to swallow me up : and what with fear and the howling and raging of the wind , I was like a mazed boy , sir . And I knelt down and tried to pray ; and then , in one moment , all the evil things I ’d ever done , and the bad words and thoughts that ever crossed me , rose up together as clear as one page of a print - book ; and I knew that if I died that minute I should go to hell . And then I saw through the ground all the water in the shafts glaring like blood , and all the sides of the shafts fierce red - hot , as if hell was coming up . And I heard the knockers knocking , or thought I heard them , as plain as I hear that grasshopper in the hedge now . ’
77684	77690	77081	77081	he	2290	‘ What are the knockers ? ’
77691	77740	77081	77081	he	2290	‘ They are the ghosts , the miners hold , of the old Jews , sir , that crucified our Lord , and were sent for slaves by the Roman emperors to work the mines ; and we find their old smelting - houses , which we call Jews ’
77761	77806	77081	77081	he	2290	’ tin ; and there ’s a town among us , too , which we call Market - Jew — but the old name was Marazion ; that means the Bitterness of Zion , they tell me . Is n’t it so , sir ? ’
77807	77813	77815	77815	Lancelot	172	‘ I believe it is , ’
77826	77968	77815	77815	Lancelot	172	‘ And bitter work it was for them , no doubt , poor souls ! We used to break into the old shafts and adits which they had made , and find old stags’-horn pickaxes , that crumbled to pieces when we brought them to grass ; and they say , that if a man will listen , sir , of a still night , about those old shafts , he may hear the ghosts of them at working , knocking , and picking , as clear as if there was a man at work in the next level . It may be all an old fancy . I suppose it is . But I believed it when I was a boy ; and it helped the work in me that night . But I ’ll go on with my story . ’
77969	77977	77979	77979	Lancelot	172	‘ Go on with what you like , ’
77981	78300	77815	77815	Lancelot	172	‘ Well , sir , I was down on my knees among the furze - bushes , and I tried to pray ; but I was too frightened , for I felt the beast I had been , sir ; and I expected the ground to open and let me down every moment ; and then there came by over my head a rushing , and a cry . “ Ha ! ha ! ha ! Paul ! ” it said ; and it seemed as if all the devils and witches were out on the wind , a - laughing at my misery . “ Oh , I ’ll mend — I’ll repent , ” I said , “ indeed I will : ” and again it came back,—“Ha ! ha ! ha ! Paul ! ” it said . I knew afterwards that it was a bird ; but the Lord sent it to me for a messenger , no less , that night . And I shook like a reed in the water ; and then , all at once a thought struck me . “ Why should I be a coward ? Why should I be afraid of shafts , or devils , or hell , or anything else ? If I am a miserable sinner , there ’s One died for me — I owe him love , not fear at all . I ’ll not be frightened into doing right — that ’s a rascally reason for repentance . ” And so it was , sir , that I rose up like a man , and said to the Lord Jesus , right out into the black , dumb air,—“If you ’ll be on my side this night , good Lord , that died for me , I ’ll be on your side for ever , villain as I am , if I ’m

78590	78656	78753	78754	modern landlords	2308	’ Lancelot half understood him , and sighed . A long silence followed , as they paced on past lonely farmyards , from which the rich manure - water was draining across the road in foul black streams , festering and steaming in the chill night air . Lancelot sighed as he saw the fruitful materials of food running to waste , and thought of the ‘
78660	78736	78753	78754	modern landlords	2308	’ cry ; and then he looked across to the miles of brown moorland on the opposite side of the valley , that lay idle and dreary under the autumn moon , except where here and there a squatter ’s cottage and rood of fruitful garden gave the lie to the laziness and ignorance of man , who pretends that it is not worth his while to cultivate the soil which God has given him . ‘
78740	78744	78753	78754	modern landlords	2308	’ he thought , ‘
78799	78835	78841	78842	Mistress Cooper	337	’ As they passed through the miserable hamlet - street of Ashy , they saw a light burning in window . At the door below , a haggard woman was looking anxiously down the village . ‘
78844	78848	78841	78842	Mistress Cooper	337	’ asked Tregarva . ‘

78969	78976	78954	78954	you	2319	’ answered the woman , peevishly . ‘
79082	79087	79097	79097	Tregarva	173	’ Lancelot sighed again . ‘

79280	79338	79339	79339	I	0	’ At this moment two cloaked and veiled figures came up to the door , followed by a servant . There was no mistaking those delicate footsteps , and the two young men drew back with fluttering hearts , and breathed out silent blessings on the ministering angels , as they entered the crazy and reeking house . ‘
79340	79345	79347	79347	Tregarva	173	’m thinking , sir , ’
79357	79383	79347	79347	Tregarva	173	‘ that it is hard of the gentlemen to leave all God ’s work to the ladies , as nine - tenths of them do . ’
79384	79405	79339	79339	I	0	‘ And I am thinking , Tregarva , that both for ladies and gentlemen , prevention is better than cure . ’
79406	79440	79441	79441	Lancelot	172	‘ There ’s a great change come over Miss Argemone , sir . She used not to be so ready to start out at midnight to visit dying folk . A blessed change ! ’
79519	79526	79514	79514	Argemone	150	‘ a curse upon the Lavingtons , ’
79573	79585	79586	79586	he	172	‘ What did Old Harry mean about the Nun - pool ? ’
79591	79599	79586	79586	he	172	‘ Every one seemed to understand him . ’
79600	79653	79586	79586	he	172	‘ Ah , sir , he ought n’t to have talked of it ! But dying men , at times , see over the dark water into deep things — deeper than they think themselves . Perhaps there ’s one speaks through them . But I thought every one knew the story . ’
79654	79662	79586	79586	he	172	‘ I do not , at least . ’
79663	79674	79586	79586	he	172	‘ Perhaps it ’s so much the better , sir . ’
79675	79701	79586	79586	he	172	‘ Why ? I must insist on knowing . It is necessary — proper , that is — that I should hear everything that concerns — ’
79702	79889	79586	79586	he	172	‘ I understand , sir ; so it is ; and I ’ll tell you . The story goes , that in the old Popish times , when the nuns held Whitford Priors , the first Mr. Lavington that ever was came from the king with a warrant to turn them all out , poor souls , and take the lands for his own . And they say the head lady of them — prioress , or abbess , as they called her — withstood him , and cursed him , in the name of the Lord , for a hypocrite who robbed harmless women under the cloak of punishing them for sins they ’d never committed ( for they say , sir , he went up to court , and slandered the nuns there for drunkards and worse ) . And she told him , “ That the curse of the nuns of Whitford should be on him and his , till they helped the poor in the spirit of the nuns of Whitford , and the Nun - pool ran up to Ashy Down . ’
79891	79899	79901	79901	Lancelot	172	‘ That time is not come yet , ’
79903	79999	79901	79901	Lancelot	172	‘ But the worst is to come , sir . For he or his , sir , that night , said or did something to the lady , that was more than woman ’s heart could bear : and the next morning she was found dead and cold , drowned in that weir - pool . And there the gentleman ’s eldest son was drowned , and more than one Lavington beside . Miss Argemone ’s only brother , that was the heir , was drowned there too , when he was a little one . ’
80000	80010	79586	79586	he	172	‘ I never heard that she had a brother . ’
80011	80094	79901	79901	Lancelot	172	‘ No , sir , no one talks of it . There are many things happen in the great house that you must go to the little house to hear of . But the country - folk believe , sir , that the nun ’s curse holds true ; and they say , that Whitford folks have been getting poorer and wickeder ever since that time , and will , till the Nun - pool runs up to Ashy , and the Lavingtons ’
80102	80155	79586	79586	he	172	’ Lancelot said nothing . A presentiment of evil hung over him . He was utterly down - hearted about Tregarva , about Argemone , about the poor . The truth was , he could not shake off the impression of the scene he had left , utterly disappointed and disgusted with the ‘
80158	80257	79586	79586	he	172	’ He had expected , as I said before , at least to hear something of pastoral sentiment , and of genial frolicsome humour ; to see some innocent , simple enjoyment : but instead , what had he seen but vanity , jealousy , hoggish sensuality , dull vacuity ? drudges struggling for one night to forget their drudgery . And yet withal , those songs , and the effect which they produced , showed that in these poor creatures , too , lay the germs of pathos , taste , melody , soft and noble affections . ‘
80263	80267	79586	79586	he	172	’ thought he , ‘
80443	80468	80421	80421	God	281	’ Tregarva ’s meditations must have been running in a very different channel , for he suddenly burst out , after a long silence — ‘
80497	80517	80421	80421	God	281	’ children especially , for they run utterly wild ; their parents have no hold on them at all . ’
80518	80530	80532	80532	Lancelot	172	‘ They tell them that they are children of the devil , ’
80534	80550	80532	80532	Lancelot	172	‘ What wonder if the children take them at their word , and act accordingly ? ’
80551	80584	80421	80421	God	281	‘ The parson here , sir , who is a God - fearing man enough , tried hard to put down this one , but the innkeepers were too strong for him . ’
80585	80609	80421	80421	God	281	‘ To take away their only amusement , in short . He had much better have set to work to amuse them himself . ’
80610	80641	80532	80532	Lancelot	172	‘ His business is to save souls , sir , and not to amuse them . I do n’t see , sir , what Christian people want with such vanities . ’
80971	80981	80982	80982	he	172	‘ I have ruined you , my poor boy , ’
80987	81004	80982	80982	he	172	‘ so you may as well take your money ’s worth out of me in bullying . ’

81408	81539	81406	81406	Lancelot	172	‘ like you , I would call this credit system of yours the devil ’s selfish counterfeit of God ’s order of mutual love and trust ; the child of that miserable dream , which , as Dr. Chalmers well said , expects universal selfishness to do the work of universal love . Look at your credit system , how — not in its abuse , but in its very essence — it carries the seeds of self - destruction . In the first place , a man ’s credit depends , not upon his real worth and property , but upon his reputation for property ; daily and hourly he is tempted , he is forced , to puff himself , to pretend to be richer than he is . ’
81548	81558	81545	81545	his	1279	‘ We all do it , my dear boy . ’
81559	81672	81673	81674	The banker	1279	‘ I know it . You must do it , or be more than human . There is lie the first , and look at lie the second . This credit system is founded on the universal faith and honour of men towards men . But do you think faith and honour can be the children of selfishness ? Men must be chivalrous and disinterested to be honourable . And you expect them all to join in universal faith — each for his own selfish interest ? You forget that if that is the prime motive , men will be honourable only as long as it suits that same self - interest . ’
81680	81687	81689	81689	Lancelot	172	‘ Yes , my dear uncle , ’
81691	81957	81689	81689	Lancelot	172	‘ you all forget it , though you suffer for it daily and hourly ; though the honourable men among you complain of the stain which has fallen on the old chivalrous good faith of English commerce , and say that now , abroad as well as at home , an Englishman ’s word is no longer worth other men ’s bonds . You see the evil , and you deplore it in disgust . Ask yourself honestly , how can you battle against it , while you allow in practice , and in theory too , except in church on Sundays , the very falsehood from which it all springs?—that a man is bound to get wealth , not for his country , but for himself ; that , in short , not patriotism , but selfishness , is the bond of all society . Selfishness can collect , not unite , a herd of cowardly wild cattle , that they may feed together , breed together , keep off the wolf and bear together . But when one of your wild cattle falls sick , what becomes of the corporate feelings of the herd then ? For one man of your class who is nobly helped by his fellows , are not the thousand left behind to perish ? Your Bible talks of society , not as a herd , but as a living tree , an organic individual body , a holy brotherhood , and kingdom of God . And here is an idol which you have set up instead of it ! ’

Henceforth I shall touch no farthing which is the fruit of a system which I can not approve . I accuse no one . Actions may vary in rightfulness , according to the age and the person . But what may be right for you , because you think it right , is surely wrong for me because I think it wrong . ’

But , alas ! to his letter no second had been returned ; and he felt — though he dared not confess it to himself — a gloomy presentiment of evil flit across him , as he thought of his fallen fortunes , and the altered light in which his suit would be regarded by Argemone ’s parents . Once he blamed himself bitterly for not having gone to Mr. Lavington the moment he discovered Argemone ’s affection , and insuring — as he then might have done — his consent . But again he felt that no sloth had kept him back , but adoring reverence for his God - given treasure , and humble astonishment at his own happiness ; and he fled from the thought into renewed examination into the state of the masses , the effect of which was only to deepen his own determination to share their lot . But at the same time it seemed to him but fair to live , as long as it would last , on that part of his capital which his creditors would have given nothing for — namely , his information ; and he set to work to write . But , alas ! he had but a ‘
83423	83769	83795	83795	God	281	’ and the entrée of the initiated ring is not obtained in a day ... Besides , he would not write trash.—He was in far too grim a humour for that ; and if he wrote on important subjects , able editors always were in the habit of entrusting them to old contributors,—men , in short , in whose judgment they had confidence — not to say anything which would commit the magazine to anything but its own little party - theory . And behold ! poor Lancelot found himself of no party whatsoever . He was in a minority of one against the whole world , on all points , right or wrong . He had the unhappiest knack ( as all geniuses have ) of seeing connections , humorous or awful , between the most seemingly antipodal things ; of illustrating every subject from three or four different spheres which it is anathema to mention in the same page . If he wrote a physical - science article , able editors asked him what the deuce a scrap of high - churchism did in the middle of it ? If he took the same article to a high - church magazine , the editor could not commit himself to any theory which made the earth more than six thousand years old , and was afraid that the public taste would not approve of the allusions to free - masonry and Soyer ’s soup ... And worse than that , one and all — Jew , Turk , infidel , and heretic , as well as the orthodox — joined in pious horror at his irreverence;—the shocking way he had of jumbling religion and politics — the human and the divine — the theories of the pulpit with the facts of the exchange ... The very atheists , who laughed at him for believing in a God , agreed that that , at least , was inconsistent with the dignity of the God — who did not exist ... It was Syncretism ... Pantheism .... ‘
83775	83788	83795	83795	God	281	’ quoth Lancelot to himself , in bitter rage , one day , ‘
83945	83998	84326	84326	you	0	’ ... So he went forth with them to market ; and behold ! they were bought forthwith . There was verily a demand for such ; ... and in spite of the ten thousand ink - fountains which were daily pouring out similar Stygian liquors , the public thirst remained unslaked . ‘
84001	84005	84326	84326	you	0	’ thought Lancelot , ‘
84032	84308	84030	84030	Luke	137	’ Ah ! where was poor Luke ? Lancelot had received from him one short and hurried note , blotted with tears , which told how he had informed his father ; and how his father had refused to see him , and had forbid him the house ; and how he had offered him an allowance of fifty pounds a year ( it should have been five hundred , he said , if he had possessed it ) , which Luke ’s director , sensibly enough , had compelled him to accept ... And there the letter ended , abruptly , leaving the writer evidently in lower depths than he had either experienced already , or expected at all . Lancelot had often pleaded for him with his father ; but in vain . Not that the good man was hard - hearted : he would cry like a child about it all to Lancelot when they sat together after dinner . But he was utterly beside himself , what with grief , shame , terror , and astonishment . On the whole , the sorrow was a real comfort to him : it gave him something beside his bankruptcy to think of ; and , distracted between the two different griefs , he could brood over neither . But of the two , certainly his son ’s conversion was the worst in his eyes . The bankruptcy was intelligible — measurable ; it was something known and classified — part of the ills which flesh ( or , at least , commercial flesh ) is heir to . But going to Rome ! — ‘
84371	84397	84359	84359	you	0	’ Lancelot quite agreed that there were reasons for it , that they — or , at least , the banker — did not know ... ‘
84433	84473	84477	84477	I	0	’ Lancelot tried in vain to make him understand that a man might sacrifice everything to conscience , and actually give up all worldly weal for what he thought right . The banker turned on him with angry resignation — ‘
84535	84572	84527	84527	I	0	’ Lancelot argued : but in vain . The idea of disinterested sacrifice was so utterly foreign to the good man ’s own creed and practice , that he could but see one pair of alternatives . ‘
84610	84633	84644	84644	he	2431	’ Lancelot gently hinted that there might be other selfish ends besides pecuniary ones — saving one ’s soul , for instance . ‘
84716	84774	84713	84714	those Jesuits	2441	’ And as soon as he began upon the Jesuits , Lancelot prudently held his tongue . The good man had worked himself up into a perfect frenzy of terror and suspicion about them . He suspected concealed Jesuits among his footmen and his housemaids ; Jesuits in his counting - house , Jesuits in his duns .... ‘
84798	84799	84788	84789	a Jesuit	2443	’ ‘
84806	84818	84800	84800	I	0	’ quoth Lancelot , and suited the action to the word . ‘
84830	84883	84829	84829	They	2445	’re everywhere , I tell you . That vicar of Whitford was a Jesuit . I was sure of it all along ; but the man seemed so pious ; and certainly he did my poor dear boy a deal of good . But he ruined you , you know . And I ’m

84934	84935	84923	84923	they	2447	’ ‘
84958	84970	84957	84957	I	0	’m sick of life ! Nothing but rogues wherever one turns ! ’
84995	85026	84973	84973	Lancelot	172	‘ What ! Why , he ’d convert us all ! He ’d convert his sisters ! He ’d bring his priests in here , or his nuns disguised as ladies ’
85049	85050	85051	85051	You	172	’ ‘
85070	85071	85072	85072	Sir	753	’ ‘
85145	85146	85181	85181	God	281	’ ‘
85149	85153	85181	85181	God	281	’ thought Lancelot , ‘
85393	85587	85386	85386	Luke	137	’ But there was no use arguing with a man in such a state of mind ; and gradually Lancelot gave it up , in hopes that time would bring the good man to his sane wits again , and that a father ’s feelings would prove themselves stronger , because more divine , than a so - called Protestant ’s fears , though that would have been , in the banker ’s eyes , and in the Jesuit ’s also — so do extremes meet — the very reason for expecting them to be the weaker ; for it is the rule with all bigots , that the right cause is always a lost cause , and therefore requires — God ’s weapons of love , truth , and reason being well known to be too weak — to be defended , if it is to be saved , with the devil ’s weapons of bad logic , spite , and calumny . At last , in despair of obtaining tidings of his cousin by any other method , Lancelot made up his mind to apply to a certain remarkable man , whose ‘
85589	85634	85638	85638	your	2465	’ had preceded Luke ’s about a year , and had , indeed , mainly caused it . He went , ... and was not disappointed . With the most winning courtesy and sweetness , his story and his request were patiently listened to . ‘
85677	85697	85699	85699	my	0	’ This was spoken with so sweet and arch a smile , that it was impossible to be angry . ‘
85777	85778	85768	85768	he	2467	’ ‘
85793	85796	85780	85780	they	2468	’ said the ‘

86247	86272	86274	86274	him	1784	’ Slowly his companion raised his thin hand , and pointed to the crucifix , which stood at the other end of the apartment . ‘
86276	86322	86274	86274	him	1784	’ and he bowed his head once more ... and Lancelot , he knew not why , did the same ... and yet in an instant he threw his head up proudly , and answered with George Fox ’s old reply to the Puritans , — ‘
86354	86355	86356	86356	He	1784	’ ‘
86361	86362	86356	86356	He	1784	’ ‘

86598	86624	86582	86582	they	2517	’ A quiet smile lighted up the thin wan face , full of unfathomable thoughts ; and he replied , again half to himself , — ‘
86683	86684	86663	86663	You	2515	’ ‘
86696	86709	86711	86712	a man	445	’ And the father blessed him fervently , and he went out ... ‘
86714	86720	86711	86712	a man	445	’ said he to himself , ‘
86748	86784	86785	86785	My	0	’ Next day he met Luke in that room . Their talk was short and sad . Luke was on the point of entering an order devoted especially to the worship of the Blessed Virgin . ‘
86809	86810	86799	86799	She	2527	’ ‘
86823	86824	86799	86799	She	2527	’ ‘

87011	87033	87001	87001	Kali	354	’ thought Lancelot to himself ; but he had not the heart to say it , and he only replied , — ‘
87096	87097	87081	87081	she	2543	’ ‘
87101	87106	87081	87081	she	2543	’ asked poor Luke . ‘
87142	87143	87144	87144	You	2549	’ ‘

They both endured like heroes ; but the former for a selfish , if not a blasphemous end ; the latter , as a man should , to test and strengthen his own powers of endurance ... There , I will say no more . Go your way , in God ’s name . There must be lessons to be learnt in all strong and self - restraining action ... So you will learn something from the scourge and the hair - shirt . We must all take the bitter medicine of suffering , I suppose . ’
87408	87425	87289	87290	John Mytton	359	‘ And , therefore , I am the wiser , in forcing the draught on myself . ’
87426	87466	87289	87290	John Mytton	359	‘ Provided it be the right draught , and do not require another and still bitterer one to expel the effects of the poison . I have no faith in people ’s doctoring themselves , either physically or spiritually . ’
87467	87492	87289	87290	John Mytton	359	‘ I am not my own physician ; I follow the rules of an infallible Church , and the examples of her canonised saints . ’
87493	87537	87289	87290	John Mytton	359	‘ Well ... perhaps they may have known what was best for themselves ... But as for you and me here , in the year 1849 ... However , we shall argue on for ever . Forgive me if I have offended you . ’
87538	87554	87289	87290	John Mytton	359	‘ I am not offended . The Catholic Church has always been a persecuted one . ’
87555	87572	87289	87290	John Mytton	359	‘ Then walk with me a little way , and I will persecute you no more . ’
87573	87579	87289	87290	John Mytton	359	‘ Where are you going ? ’
87580	87585	87586	87586	Lancelot	172	‘ To ... To — ’
87595	87698	87586	87586	Lancelot	172	‘ To my father ’s ! Ah ! what a son I would have been to him now , in his extreme need ! ... And he will not let me ! Lancelot , is it impossible to move him ? I do not want to go home again ... to live there ... I could not face that , though I longed but this moment to do it . I can not face the self - satisfied , pitying looks ... the everlasting suspicion that they suspect me to be speaking untruths , or proselytising in secret ... Cruel and unjust ! ’
87720	87768	87712	87712	he	137	‘ No ; I will not see him . Better thus ; better vanish , and be known only according to the spirit by the spirits of saints and confessors , and their successors upon earth . No ! I will die , and give no sign . ’
87769	87780	87586	87586	Lancelot	172	‘ I must see somewhat more of you , indeed . ’
87781	87853	87873	87873	himself	172	‘ I will meet you here , then , two hours hence . Near that house — even along the way which leads to it — I can not go . It would be too painful : too painful to think that you were walking towards it,—the old house where I was born and bred ... and I shut out,—even though it be for the sake of the kingdom of heaven ! ’
87854	87869	87873	87873	himself	172	‘ Or for the sake of your own share therein , my poor cousin ! ’
87875	87883	87873	87873	himself	172	‘ which is a very different matter . ’
87884	87893	87586	87586	Lancelot	172	‘ Whither , after you have been — ? ’
87903	87909	87894	87894	Luke	137	‘ To Claude Mellot ’s . ’
87910	87932	87873	87873	himself	172	‘ I will walk part of the way thither with you . But he is a very bad companion for you . ’
87933	88047	87894	87894	Luke	137	‘ I ca n’t help that . I can not live ; and I am going to turn painter . It is not the road in which to find a fortune ; but still , the very sign - painters live somehow , I suppose . I am going this very afternoon to Claude Mellot , and enlist . I sold the last of my treasured MSS . to a fifth - rate magazine this morning , for what it would fetch . It has been like eating one ’s own children — but , at least , they have fed me . So now “ to fresh fields and pastures new . ” ’
88102	88438	88094	88094	he	172	‘ My beloved ! my husband!—Yes — though you may fancy me fickle and proud — I will call you so to the last ; for were I fickle , I could have saved myself the agony of writing this ; and as for pride , oh ! how that darling vice has been crushed out of me ! I have rolled at my mother ’s feet with bitter tears , and vain entreaties — and been refused ; and yet I have obeyed her after all . We must write to each other no more . This one last letter must explain the forced silence which has been driving me mad with fears that you would suspect me . And now you may call me weak ; but it is your love which has made me strong to do this — which has taught me to see with new intensity my duty , not only to you , but to every human being — to my parents . By this self - sacrifice alone can I atone to them for all my past undutifulness . Let me , then , thus be worthy of you . Hope that by this submission we may win even her to change . How calmly I write ! but it is only my hand that is calm . As for my heart , read Tennyson ’s Fatima , and then know how I feel towards you ! Yes , I love you — madly , the world would say . I seem to understand now how women have died of love . Ay , that indeed would be blessed ; for then my spirit would seek out yours , and hover over it for ever ! Farewell , beloved ! and let me hear of you through your deeds . A feeling at my heart , which should not be , although it is , a sad one , tells me that we shall meet soon — soon . ’
88460	88569	88447	88448	Mrs. Lavington	158	‘ I can not deceive you or myself by saying I regret that providential circumstances should have been permitted to break off a connection which I always felt to be most unsuitable ; and I rejoice that the intercourse my dear child has had with you has not so far undermined her principles as to prevent her yielding the most filial obedience to my wishes on the point of her future correspondence with you . Hoping that all that has occurred will be truly blessed to you , and lead your thoughts to another world , and to a true concern for the safety of your immortal soul , ‘

88963	88995	88960	88961	the stranger	2568	‘ Did I not warn you of the folly and sin of sinking capital in foreign countries while English land was crying out for tillage , and English poor for employment ? ’

Say to yourself , not “ I will invest this money where it shall pay me most , but I will invest it where it shall give most employment to English hands , and produce most manufactures for English bodies . ” In short , seek first the kingdom of God and His justice with this money of yours , and see if all other things , profits and suchlike included , are not added unto you . ’
89251	89262	89092	89093	the banker	1279	‘ And you are certain you can obtain the money ? ’

89304	89393	89092	89093	the banker	1279	‘ Did I never tell you ? The new king of the Cannibal Islands , just like your European ones , ran away , and would neither govern himself nor let any one else govern ; so one morning his ministers , getting impatient , ate him , and then asked my advice . I recommended them to put his mother on the throne , who , being old and tough , would run less danger ; and since then everything has gone on smoothly as anywhere else . ’

89534	89566	89443	89443	he	172	‘ Well , there was a great deal of noble feeling in them , and a great deal of abominable nonsense . You seem to be very anxious to reform society ? ’

90083	90144	90080	90080	he	172	‘ But what do you mean by standing off in that way , as if we were not old and fast friends ? Remember , I am as poor as you are now ; you may look me in the face and call me your equal , if you will , or your inferior ; I shall not deny it . ’
90145	90151	90153	90153	Tregarva	173	‘ Pardon me , sir , ’
90155	90178	90153	90153	Tregarva	173	‘ but I never felt what a real substantial thing rank is , as I have since this sad misfortune of yours . ’
90179	90191	90153	90153	Tregarva	173	‘ And I have never till now found out its worthlessness . ’
90192	90194	90153	90153	Tregarva	173	‘ You ’re
90226	90473	90474	90474	he	2580	’re still a gentleman . No man can take that from you . You may look the proudest duchess in the land in the face , and claim her as your equal ; while I , sir,—I do n’t mean , though , to talk of myself — but suppose that you had loved a pious and a beautiful lady , and among all your worship of her , and your awe of her , had felt that you were worthy of her , that you could become her comforter , and her pride , and her joy , if it was n’t for that accursed gulf that men had put between you , that you were no gentleman ; that you did n’t know how to walk , and how to pronounce , and when to speak , and when to be silent , not even how to handle your own knife and fork without disgusting her , or how to keep your own body clean and sweet — Ah , sir , I see it now as I never did before , what a wall all these little defects build up round a poor man ; how he longs and struggles to show himself as he is at heart , and can not , till he feels sometimes as if he was enchanted , pent up , like folks in fairy tales , in the body of some dumb beast . But , sir , ’
90491	90609	90474	90474	he	2580	‘ just because this gulf which rank makes is such a deep one , therefore it looks to me all the more devilish ; not that I want to pull down any man to my level ; I despise my own level too much ; I want to rise ; I want those like me to rise with me . Let the rich be as rich as they will.—I , and those like me , covet not money , but manners . Why should not the workman be a gentleman , and a workman still ? Why are they to be shut out from all that is beautiful , and delicate , and winning , and stately ? ’
90610	90614	90616	90616	Lancelot	172	‘ Now perhaps , ’
90618	90635	90616	90616	Lancelot	172	‘ you begin to understand what I was driving at on that night of the revel ? ’
90636	90750	90751	90751	Lancelot	172	‘ It has come home to me lately , sir , bitterly enough . If you knew what had gone on in me this last fortnight , you would know that I had cause to curse the state of things which brings a man up a savage against his will , and cuts him off , as if he were an ape or a monster , from those for whom the same Lord died , and on whom the same Spirit rests . Is that God ’s will , sir ? No , it is the devil ’s will . “ Those whom God hath joined , let no man put asunder . ” ’
90882	91013	90875	90875	he	173	‘ The rich can not guess , sir , how high ill - feeling is rising in these days . It ’s not only those who are outwardly poorest who long for change ; the middling people , sir , the small town shopkeepers especially , are nearly past all patience . One of the City Mission assured me that he has been watching them these several years past , and that nothing could beat their fortitude and industry , and their determination to stand peaceably by law and order ; but yet , this last year or two , things are growing too bad to bear . Do what they will , they can not get their bread ; and when a man can not get that , sir — ’
91014	91026	90875	90875	he	173	‘ But what do you think is the reason of it ? ’
91027	91094	91165	91165	God	281	‘ How should I tell , sir ? But if I had to say , I should say this — just what they say themselves — that there are too many of them . Go where you will , in town or country , you ’ll find half - a - dozen shops struggling for a custom that would only keep up one , and so they ’re
91116	91145	91165	91165	God	281	’re forced to get them down lower by foul — to sand the sugar , and sloe - leave the tea , and put — Satan only that prompts ’em
91191	91212	91190	91190	they	2586	’re eating up their neighbours , their neighbours eat up them ; and so they all come to ruin together . ’
91213	91253	91173	91173	They	2586	‘ Why , you talk like Mr. Mill himself , Tregarva ; you ought to have been a political economist , and not a City missionary . By the bye , I do n’t like that profession for you . ’
91254	91278	91190	91190	they	2586	‘ It ’s the Lord ’s work , sir . It ’s the very sending to the Gentiles that the Lord promised me . ’
91279	91380	91381	91382	The giant	3364	‘ I do n’t doubt it , Paul ; but you are meant for other things , if not better . There are plenty of smaller men than you to do that work . Do you think that God would have given you that strength , that brain , to waste on a work which could be done without them ? Those limbs would certainly be good capital for you , if you turned a live model at the Academy . Perhaps you ’d better be mine ; but you ca n’t even be that if you go to Manchester . ’
91391	91593	91595	91595	he	2590	‘ Well ! God only knows what use they are of just now . But as for the brains , sir — in much learning is much sorrow . One had much better work than read , I find . If I read much more about what men might be , and are not , and what English soil might be , and is not , I shall go mad . And that puts me in mind of one thing I came here for , though , like a poor rude country fellow as I am , I clean forgot it a thinking of — Look here , sir ; you ’ve given me a sight of books in my time , and God bless you for it . But now I hear that — that you are determined to be a poor man like us ; and that you sha n’t be , while Paul Tregarva has ought of yours . So I ’ve just brought all the books back , and there they lie in the hall ; and may God reward you for the loan of them to his poor child ! And so , sir , farewell ; ’
91600	91613	91595	91595	he	2590	‘ No , Paul ; the books and you shall never part . ’
91614	91629	91190	91190	they	2586	‘ And I say , sir , the books and you shall never part . ’
91630	91738	91595	91595	he	2590	‘ Then we two can never part’—and a sudden impulse flashed over him—‘and we will not part , Paul ! The only man whom I utterly love , and trust , and respect on the face of God ’s earth , is you ; and I can not lose sight of you . If we are to earn our bread , let us earn it together ; if we are to endure poverty , and sorrow , and struggle to find out the way of bettering these wretched millions round us , let us learn our lesson together , and help each other to spell it out . ’
91739	91747	91749	91749	Paul	173	‘ Do you mean what you say ? ’
91752	91756	91749	91749	Paul	173	‘ I do . ’
91757	91801	91595	91595	he	2590	‘ Then I say what you say . Where thou goest , I will go ; and where thou lodgest , I will lodge . Come what will , I will be your servant , for good luck or bad , for ever . ’
91802	91812	91595	91595	he	2590	‘ My equal , Paul , not my servant . ’
91813	91886	91749	91749	Paul	173	‘ I know my place , sir . When I am as learned and as well - bred as you , I shall not refuse to call myself your equal ; and the sooner that day comes , the better I shall be pleased . Till then I am your friend and your brother ; but I am your scholar too , and I shall not set up myself against my master . ’
91887	91971	91595	91595	he	2590	‘ I have learnt more of you , Paul , than ever you have learnt of me . But be it as you will ; only whatever you may call yourself , we must eat at the same table , live in the same room , and share alike all this world ’s good things — or we shall have no right to share together this world ’s bad things . If that is your bargain , there is my hand on it . ’
91972	91975	91595	91595	he	2590	‘ Amen ! ’
92009	92129	91595	91595	he	2590	‘ And now , sir , I have promised — and you would have me keep my promise — to go and work for the City Mission in Manchester — at least , for the next month , till a young man ’s place who has just left , is filled up . Will you let me go for that time ? and then , if you hold your present mind , we will join home and fortunes thenceforth , and go wherever the Lord shall send us . There ’s work enough of His waiting to be done . I do n’t doubt but if we are willing and able , He will set us about the thing we ’re
92133	92162	92163	92164	The Lord	817	’ As Lancelot opened the door for him , he lingered on the steps , and grasping his hand , said , in a low , earnest voice : ‘
92199	92200	92184	92184	He	817	’ ‘
92204	92211	92212	92212	he	817	’ as John Bunyan has it , ‘
92218	92294	92212	92212	he	817	’ and Lancelot saw him no more till — but I must not outrun the order of time . After all , this visit came to Lancelot timely . It had roused him to hope , and turned off his feelings from the startling news he had just heard . He stepped along arm in arm with Luke , cheerful , and fate - defiant , and as he thought of Tregarva ’s complaints , — ‘
92298	92304	92212	92212	he	817	’ he said to himself , ‘
92382	92393	92396	92396	he	2600	’ Luke began at once questioning him about his father . ‘
92409	92410	92402	92402	he	2600	’ ‘
92414	92415	92402	92402	he	2600	’ ‘
92447	92460	92473	92473	he	2600	’ Lancelot smiled ; but Luke went on , not perceiving him . ‘
92533	92534	92536	92536	you	2607	’ ‘
92539	92546	92536	92536	you	2607	’ asked Lancelot with a smile , ‘

93502	93535	93497	93499	the “ masses	2654	‘ Thank Heaven that you do see that,—that in a country calling itself civilised and Christian , pestilence should be the peculiar heritage of the poor ! It is past all comment . ’
93536	93556	93455	93456	an artisan	2650	‘ And yet are not these pestilences a judgment , even on them , for their dirt and profligacy ? ’
93557	93623	93497	93499	the “ masses	2654	‘ And how should they be clean without water ? And how can you wonder if their appetites , sickened with filth and self - disgust , crave after the gin - shop for temporary strength , and then for temporary forgetfulness ? Every London doctor knows that I speak the truth ; would that every London preacher would tell that truth from his pulpit ! ’
93624	93642	93497	93499	the “ masses	2654	‘ Then would you too say , that God punishes one class for the sins of another ? ’
93643	93648	93650	93650	Lancelot	172	‘ Some would say , ’
93655	93753	93497	93499	the “ masses	2654	‘ that He may be punishing them for not demanding their right to live like human beings , to all those social circumstances which shall not make their children ’s life one long disease . But are not these pestilences a judgment on the rich , too , in the truest sense of the word ? Are they not the broad , unmistakable seal to God ’s opinion of a state of society which confesses its economic relations to be so utterly rotten and confused , that it actually can not afford to save yearly millions of pounds ’
93837	93854	93855	93855	He	2656	’ By this time they had reached the artist ’s house . Luke refused to enter ... ‘
93869	93904	93855	93855	He	2656	’ ... And with a tearful last farewell , he turned away up the street , leaving Lancelot to gaze at his slow , painful steps , and abject , earth - fixed mien . ‘
93907	93911	93855	93855	He	2656	’ thought Lancelot , ‘
94119	94142	94095	94096	Ye hypocrites	2681	’ He was ushered upstairs to the door of his studio , at which he knocked , and was answered by a loud ‘
94146	94215	94095	94096	Ye hypocrites	2681	’ Lancelot heard a rustle as he entered , and caught sight of a most charming little white foot retreating hastily through the folding doors into the inner room . The artist , who was seated at his easel , held up his brush as a signal of silence , and did not even raise his eyes till he had finished the touches on which he was engaged . ‘

94503	94673	94497	94497	your	0	’ As he spoke , the folding doors opened , and an exquisite little brunette danced in from the inner room , in which , by the bye , had been going on all the while a suspicious rustling , as of garments hastily arranged . She was dressed gracefully in a loose French morning - gown , down which Lancelot ’s eye glanced towards the little foot , which , however , was now hidden in a tiny velvet slipper . The artist ’s wife was a real beauty , though without a single perfect feature , except a most delicious little mouth , a skin like velvet , and clear brown eyes , from which beamed earnest simplicity and arch good humour . She darted forward to her husband ’s friend , while her rippling brown hair , fantastically arranged , fluttered about her neck , and seizing Lancelot ’s hands successively in both of hers , broke out in an accent prettily tinged with French , — ‘
94771	94772	94762	94762	me	0	’ ‘
94779	94785	94762	94762	me	0	’ said Lancelot , smiling . ‘
94788	94803	94804	94805	that madcap	2698	’ she said , blushing , and shaking her pretty little fist at Claude , ‘
94842	94915	94916	94918	The dear master	2701	’ At this moment a heavy step sounded on the stairs , the door opened , and there entered , to Lancelot ’s astonishment , the stranger who had just puzzled him so much at his uncle ’s . Claude rose reverentially , and came forward , but Sabina was beforehand with him , and running up to her visitor , kissed his hand again and again , almost kneeling to him . ‘
94920	94924	94916	94918	The dear master	2701	’ she cried ; ‘

95082	95086	95053	95053	you	2705	’ he said ; ‘

95831	95958	95824	95824	we	2738	’ And with a gay farewell to the adoring little Sabina , he passed an iron arm through Lancelot ’s , and marched him down into the street . Lancelot was surprised and almost nettled at the sudden influence which he found this quaint personage was exerting over him . But he had , of late , tasted the high delight of feeling himself under the guidance of a superior mind , and longed to enjoy it once more . Perhaps they were reminiscences of this kind which stirred in him the strange fancy of a connection , almost of a likeness , between his new acquaintance and Argemone . He asked , humbly enough , why Art was to be a forbidden path to him ? ‘
96004	96038	95993	95993	He	281	’ Lancelot started . He remembered that Tregarva had said just the same thing to him that very morning , and the ( to him ) strange coincidence sank deep into his heart . ‘

96170	96182	96147	96147	they	2749	’ Silent and thoughtful , Lancelot walked on by his side . ‘

96378	96413	96414	96415	the prophet	2753	’ The evening was passed , as Claude had promised , in a truly Horatian manner . Sabina was most piquante , and Claude interspersed his genial and enthusiastic eloquence with various wise saws of ‘

97562	97873	97553	97554	my woman	2803	’ And in this hopeful state of mystification , Lancelot went home , and dreamt of Argemone . His uncle would , and , indeed , as it seemed , could , give him very little information on the question which had so excited his curiosity . He had met the man in India many years before , had received there from him most important kindnesses , and considered him , from experience , of oracular wisdom . He seemed to have an unlimited command of money , though most frugal in his private habits ; visited England for a short time every few years , and always under a different appellation ; but as for his real name , habitation , or business , here or at home , the good banker knew nothing , except that whenever questioned on them , he wandered off into Pantagruelist jokes , and ended in Cloud - land . So that Lancelot was fain to give up his questions and content himself with longing for the reappearance of this inexplicable sage . A few mornings afterwards , Lancelot , as he glanced his eye over the columns of The Times , stopped short at the beloved name of Whitford . To his disgust and disappointment , it only occurred in one of those miserable cases , now of weekly occurrence , of concealing the birth of a child . He was turning from it , when he saw Bracebridge ’s name . Another look sufficed to show him that he ought to go at once to the colonel , who had returned the day before from Norway . A few minutes brought him to his friend ’s lodging , but The Times had arrived there before him . Bracebridge was sitting over his untasted breakfast , his face buried in his hands . ‘
97880	97888	97553	97554	my woman	2803	’ he said , without looking up . ‘
97907	97942	98047	98047	Mary	185	’ He started , and looked wildly round him , as if listening for some sound which he expected , and then laid his head down on the table . Lancelot turned to go . ‘
97961	98027	98028	98028	My	0	’ Lancelot sat down . There was a fearful alteration in Bracebridge . His old keen self - confident look had vanished . He was haggard , life - weary , shame - stricken , almost abject . His limbs looked quite shrunk and powerless , as he rested his head on the table before him , and murmured incoherently from time to time , — ‘
98082	98092	98093	98093	My	0	’ Lancelot laid his hand kindly on his shoulder . ‘
98107	98108	98109	98109	They	2810	’ ‘
98112	98121	98109	98109	They	2810	’ he said , fiercely , starting up . ‘
98130	98137	98109	98109	They	2810	’ Lancelot stood horror - struck . ‘
98310	98349	98359	98359	She	2818	’ And , with a fearful oath , the wretched man sent Lancelot staggering across the room , and madly tore up the cushions . A long postman ’s knock at the door.—He suddenly rose up quite collected . ‘
98373	98396	98366	98366	I	0	’ The servant ’s step came up the stairs . Poor Bracebridge turned to Lancelot with something of his own stately determination . ‘
98410	98857	98858	98858	Sir	753	’ And with compressed lips and fixed eyes he stalked out at the door , and shut it . Lancelot heard him stop ; then the servant ’s footsteps down the stairs ; then the colonel ’s treading , slowly and heavily , went step by step up to the room above . He shut that door too . A dead silence followed . Lancelot stood in fearful suspense , and held his breath to listen . Perhaps he had fainted ? No , for then he would have heard a fall . Perhaps he had fallen on the bed ? He would go and see . No , he would wait a little longer . Perhaps he was praying ? He had told Lancelot to pray once — he dared not interrupt him now . A slight stir — a noise as of an opening box . Thank God , he was , at least , alive ! Nonsense ! Why should he not be alive ? What could happen to him ? And yet he knew that something was going to happen . The silence was ominous — unbearable ; the air of the room felt heavy and stifling , as if a thunderstorm were about to burst . He longed to hear the man raging and stamping . And yet he could not connect the thought of one so gay and full of gallant life , with the terrible dread that was creeping over him — with the terrible scene which he had just witnessed . It must be all a temporary excitement — a mistake — a hideous dream , which the next post would sweep away . He would go and tell him so . No , he could not stir . His limbs seemed leaden , his feet felt rooted to the ground , as in long nightmare . And still the intolerable silence brooded overhead . What broke it ? A dull , stifled report , as of a pistol fired against the ground ; a heavy fall ; and again the silence of death . He rushed upstairs . A corpse lay on its face upon the floor , and from among its hair , a crimson thread crept slowly across the carpet . It was all over . He bent over the head , but one look was sufficient . He did not try to lift it up . On the table lay the fatal letter . Lancelot knew that he had a right to read it . It was scrawled , mis - spelt — but there were no tear - blots on the paper : — ‘
98933	99015	99016	99017	the deceased	2827	’ Lancelot tore the letter into a hundred pieces , and swallowed them , for every foot in the house was on the stairs . So there was terror , and confusion , and running in and out : but there were no wet eyes there except those of Bracebridge ’s groom , who threw himself on the body , and would not stir . And then there was a coroner ’s inquest ; and it came out in the evidence how ‘
99035	99103	99016	99017	the deceased	2827	’ whereat the jury — as twelve honest , good - natured Christians were bound to do — returned a verdict of temporary insanity ; and in a week more the penny - a - liners grew tired ; and the world , too , who never expects anything , not even French revolutions , grew tired also of repeating,—‘Dear me ! who would have expected it ? ’

100920	100965	100966	100966	she	2874	‘ Every instant those foul memories were defiling her nostrils . A horrible loathing had taken possession of her , recurring from time to time , till it ended in delirium and fever . A scent - fiend was haunting her night and day , ’
100969	101171	100966	100966	she	2874	‘ And now the curse of the Lavingtons had truly come upon her . To perish by the people whom they made .

Have I not wantoned in down and perfumes , while they , by whose labour my luxuries were bought , were pining among scents and sounds,—one day of which would have driven me mad ! And then they wonder why men turn Chartists ! There are those horrible scents again ! Save me from them ! Lancelot — darling ! Take me to the fresh air ! I choke ! I am festering away ! The Nun - pool ! Take all the water , every drop , and wash Ashy clean again ! Make a great fountain in it — beautiful marble — to bubble and gurgle , and trickle and foam , for ever and ever , and wash away the sins of the Lavingtons , that the little rosy children may play round it , and the poor toil - bent woman may wash — and wash — and drink — Water ! water ! I am dying of thirst ! ’

You will own land , for you are worthy to own it . Oh that I could give you Whitford ! No ! It was mine too long — therefore I die ! because I — Lord Jesus ! have I not repented of my sin ? ’
101364	101397	101399	101399	he	2889	‘ No — not for me , for them — for them , and for yourself — that you may save them whom I never dreamt that I was bound to save ! ’
101495	101508	101510	101511	Mrs. Lavington	158	‘ I think , sir , you had better leave the room , ’
101610	101611	101592	101592	she	158	’ ‘
101615	101842	101592	101592	she	158	’ How little she knew what had passed there ! But if she had known , would she have been one whit softened ? For , indeed , Argemone ’s spirituality was not in her mother ’s language . And yet the good woman had prayed , and prayed , and wept bitter tears , by her daughter ’s bedside , day after day ; but she had never heard her pronounce the talismanic formula of words , necessary in her eyes to ensure salvation ; and so she was almost without hope for her . Oh , Bigotry ! Devil , who turnest God ’s love into man ’s curse ! are not human hearts hard and blind enough of themselves , without thy cursed help ? For one moment a storm of unutterable pride and rage convulsed Lancelot — the next instant love conquered ; and the strong proud man threw himself on his knees at the feet of the woman he despised , and with wild sobs entreated for one moment more — one only ! At that instant a shriek from Honoria resounded from the sick chamber . Lancelot knew what it meant , and sprang up , as men do when shot through the heart.—In a moment he was himself again . A new life had begun for him — alone . ‘
101854	101860	101843	101843	You	2896	’ he said , calmly : ‘
101865	102125	101861	101861	Argemone	150	’ Let us pass over the period of dull , stupefied misery that followed , when Lancelot had returned to his lonely lodging , and the excitement of his feelings had died away . It is impossible to describe that which could not be separated into parts , in which there was no foreground , no distance , but only one dead , black , colourless present . After a time , however , he began to find that fancies , almost ridiculously trivial , arrested and absorbed his attention ; even as when our eyes have become accustomed to darkness , every light - coloured mote shows luminous against the void blackness of night . So we are tempted to unseemly frivolity in churches , and at funerals , and all most solemn moments ; and so Lancelot found his imagination fluttering back , half amused , to every smallest circumstance of the last few weeks , as objects of mere curiosity , and found with astonishment that they had lost their power of paining him . Just as victims on the rack have fallen , it is said , by length of torture , into insensibility , and even calm repose , his brain had been wrought until all feeling was benumbed . He began to think what an interesting autobiography his life might make ; and the events of the last few years began to arrange themselves in a most attractive dramatic form . He began even to work out a scene or two , and where ‘
102127	102180	101861	101861	Argemone	150	’ seemed wanting , to invent them here and there . He sat thus for hours silent over his fire , playing with his old self , as though it were a thing which did not belong to him — a suit of clothes which he had put off , and which , ‘
102198	102476	101861	101861	Argemone	150	’ and then pieced and dizened out afresh as a toy . And then again he started away from his own thoughts , at finding himself on the edge of that very gulf , which , as Mellot had lately told him , Barnakill denounced as the true hell of genius , where Art is regarded as an end and not a means , and objects are interesting , not in as far as they form our spirits , but in proportion as they can be shaped into effective parts of some beautiful whole . But whether it was a temptation or none , the desire recurred to him again and again . He even attempted to write , but sickened at the sight of the first words . He turned to his pencil , and tried to represent with it one scene at least ; and with the horrible calmness of some self - torturing ascetic , he sat down to sketch a drawing of himself and Argemone on her dying day , with her head upon his bosom for the last time — and then tossed it angrily into the fire , partly because he felt just as he had in his attempts to write , that there was something more in all these events than he could utter by pen or pencil , than he could even understand ; principally because he could not arrange the attitudes gracefully enough . And now , in front of the stern realities of sorrow and death , he began to see a meaning in another mysterious saying of Barnakill ’s , which Mellot was continually quoting , that ‘
102527	102805	102806	102810	prophets that had become wind	2901	’ Still he felt in himself a capability , nay , an infinite longing to speak ; though what he should utter , or how — whether as poet , social theorist , preacher , he could not yet decide . Barnakill had forbidden him painting , and though he hardly knew why , he dared not disobey him . But Argemone ’s dying words lay on him as a divine command to labour . All his doubts , his social observations , his dreams of the beautiful and the blissful , his intense perception of social evils , his new - born hope — faith it could not yet be called — in a ruler and deliverer of the world , all urged him on to labour : but at what ? He felt as if he were the demon in the legend , condemned to twine endless ropes of sand . The world , outside which he now stood for good and evil , seemed to him like some frantic whirling waltz ; some serried struggling crowd , which rushed past him in aimless confusion , without allowing him time or opening to take his place among their ranks : and as for wings to rise above , and to look down upon the uproar , where were they ? His melancholy paralysed him more and more . He was too listless even to cater for his daily bread by writing his articles for the magazines . Why should he ? He had nothing to say . Why should he pour out words and empty sound , and add one more futility to the herd of ‘
102818	102947	102806	102810	prophets that had become wind	2901	’ ? Those who could write without a conscience , without an object except that of seeing their own fine words , and filling their own pockets — let them do it : for his part he would have none of it . But his purse was empty , and so was his stomach ; and as for asking assistance of his uncle , it was returning like the dog to his vomit . So one day he settled all bills with his last shilling , tied up his remaining clothes in a bundle , and stoutly stepped forth into the street to find a job — to hold a horse , if nothing better offered ; when , behold ! on the threshold he met Barnakill himself . ‘
102951	102957	102806	102810	prophets that had become wind	2901	’ said that strange personage . ‘

103027	103187	102997	102997	you	0	’ He strode off , with Lancelot after him ; entered a mathematical instrument maker ’s shop in the neighbouring street , and pointed out a heavy corded case to Lancelot , who , with the assistance of the shopman , got it on his shoulders ; and trudging forth through the streets after his employer , who walked before him silent and unregarding , felt himself for the first time in his life in the same situation as nine hundred and ninety - nine out of every thousand of Adam ’s descendants , and discovered somewhat to his satisfaction that when he could once rid his mind of its old superstition that every one was looking at him , it mattered very little whether the burden carried were a deal trunk or a Downing Street despatch - box . His employer ’s lodgings were in St. Paul ’s Churchyard . Lancelot set the trunk down inside the door . ‘
103193	103194	103190	103190	you	2908	’ ‘
103197	103550	103190	103190	you	2908	’ Barnakill looked him steadily in the face , gave him the sixpence , went in , and shut the door . Lancelot wandered down the street , half amused at the simple test which had just been applied to him , and yet sickened with disappointment ; for he had cherished a mysterious fancy that with this strange being all his hopes of future activity were bound up . Tregarva ’s month was nearly over , and yet no tidings of him had come . Mellot had left London on some mysterious errand of the prophet ’s , and for the first time in his life he seemed to stand utterly alone . He was at one pole , and the whole universe at the other . It was in vain to tell himself that his own act had placed him there ; that he had friends to whom he might appeal . He would not , he dare not , accept outward help , even outward friendship , however hearty and sincere , at that crisis of his existence . It seemed a desecration of its awfulness to find comfort in anything but the highest and the deepest . And the glimpse of that which he had attained seemed to have passed away from him again,—seemed to be something which , as it had arisen with Argemone , was lost with her also,—one speck of the far blue sky which the rolling clouds had covered in again . As he passed under the shadow of the huge soot - blackened cathedral , and looked at its grim spiked railings and closed doors , it seemed to him a symbol of the spiritual world , clouded and barred from him . He stopped and looked up , and tried to think . The rays of the setting sun lighted up in clear radiance the huge cross on the summit . Was it an omen ? Lancelot thought so ; but at that instant he felt a hand on his shoulder , and looked round . It was that strange man again . ‘
103555	103559	103190	103190	you	2908	’ said he . ‘
103587	103607	103619	103619	Mellot	182	’ Lancelot seized it , trembling , and tore it open . It was directed in Honoria ’s handwriting . ‘
103613	103617	103619	103619	Mellot	182	’ said he . ‘
103634	103665	103666	103666	Argemone	150	’ The letter was significant of Honoria ’s character . It busied itself entirely about facts , and showed the depth of her sorrow by making no allusion to it . ‘
103750	103802	103746	103746	Lancelot	172	’ All his drawings and letters had been , by Argemone ’s desire , placed with her in her coffin . Honoria had been only able to obey her in sending a favourite ring of hers , and with it the last stanzas which she had composed before her death : — ‘
103829	103859	103746	103746	Lancelot	172	‘ And myriad happy eyes are bent Upon their changeless love alway ; As , strengthened by their one intent , They pour the flood of life and day , ‘
103897	104072	104186	104186	Coleridge	396	’ The precious relic , with all its shattered hopes , came at the right moment to soften his hard - worn heart . The sight , the touch of it , shot like an electric spark through the black stifling thunder - cloud of his soul , and dissolved it in refreshing showers of tears . Barnakill led him gently within the area of the railings , where he might conceal his emotion , and it was but a few seconds before Lancelot had recovered his self - possession and followed him up the steps through the wicket door . They entered . The afternoon service was proceeding . The organ droned sadly in its iron cage to a few musical amateurs . Some nursery maids and foreign sailors stared about within the spiked felon ’s dock which shut off the body of the cathedral , and tried in vain to hear what was going on inside the choir . As a wise author — a Protestant , too — has lately said , ‘
104092	104181	104186	104186	Coleridge	396	’ The place breathed imbecility , and unreality , and sleepy life - in - death , while the whole nineteenth century went roaring on its way outside . And as Lancelot thought , though only as a dilettante , of old St. Paul ’s , the morning star and focal beacon of England through centuries and dynasties , from old Augustine and Mellitus , up to those Paul ’s Cross sermons whose thunders shook thrones , and to noble Wren ’s masterpiece of art , he asked , ‘

104227	104232	104186	104186	Coleridge	396	’ answered the other . ‘

106611	106630	107415	107416	... Lancelot	172	‘ Hither . Tregarva does not possess his Father and his Lord ; he is possessed by them . ’
106631	106689	106994	106994	Lancelot	172	‘ But he would say — and I should believe him — that he has seen and known them , not with his bodily eyes , but with his soul , heart , imagination — call it what you will . All I know is , that between him and me there is a great gulf fixed . ’
106690	106716	107415	107416	... Lancelot	172	‘ What ! seen and known them utterly ? comprehended them ? Are they not infinite , incomprehensible ? Can the less comprehend the greater ? ’
106717	106735	107415	107416	... Lancelot	172	‘ He knows , at least , enough of them to make him what I am not . ’
106736	106763	106764	106764	Lancelot	172	‘ That is , he knows something of them . And may not you know something of them also?—enough to make you what he is not ? ’
106771	106812	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Suppose that you had met and spoken with your father , and loved him when you saw him , and yet were not aware of the relation in which you stood to him , still you would know him ? ’
106813	106828	107415	107416	... Lancelot	172	‘ Not the most important thing of all — that he was my father . ’
106829	106878	107415	107416	... Lancelot	172	‘ Is that the most important thing ? Is it not more important that he should know that you were his son ? That he should support , guide , educate you , even though unseen ? Do you not know that some one has been doing that ? ’
106879	106977	106766	106766	his	172	‘ That I have been supported , guided , educated , I know full well ; but by whom I know not . And I know , too , that I have been punished . And therefore — therefore I can not free the thought of a Him — of a Person — only of a Destiny , of Laws and Powers , which have no faces wherewith to frown awful wrath upon me ! If it be a Person who has been leading me , I must go mad , or know that He has forgiven ! ’
106978	106993	107415	107416	... Lancelot	172	‘ I conceive that it is He , and not punishment which you fear ? ’
107000	107040	106994	106994	Lancelot	172	‘ Yes . He , and not hell at all , is what I fear . He can inflict no punishment on me worse than the inner hell which I have felt already , many and many a time . ’
107041	107067	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Bona verba ! That is an awful thing to say : but better this extreme than the other ... And you would — what ? ’
107068	107072	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Be pardoned . ’
107073	107085	106766	106766	his	172	‘ If He loves you , He has pardoned you already . ’

107097	107102	106766	106766	his	172	‘ How does Tregarva ? ’
107103	107113	106766	106766	his	172	‘ He is a righteous man , and I — ’
107114	107130	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Am a sinner . He would , and rightly , call himself the same . ’
107131	107147	106994	106994	Lancelot	172	‘ But he knows that God loves him — that he is God ’s child . ’
107148	107244	106766	106766	his	172	‘ So , then , God did not love him till he caused God to love him , by knowing that He loved him ? He was not God ’s child till he made himself one , by believing that he was one when as yet he was not ? I appeal to common sense and logic ... It was revealed to Tregarva that God had been loving him while he was yet a bad man . If He loved him , in spite of his sin , why should He not have loved you ? ’
107245	107275	106766	106766	his	172	‘ If He had loved me , would He have left me in ignorance of Himself ? For if He be , to know Him is the highest good . ’
107276	107286	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Had he left Tregarva in ignorance of Himself ? ’
107287	107314	106766	106766	his	172	‘ No ... Certainly , Tregarva spoke of his conversion as of a turning to one of whom he had known all along , and disregarded . ’
107315	107335	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Then do you turn like him , to Him whom you have known all along , and disregarded . ’
107336	107339	106766	106766	his	172	‘ I ? ’
107340	107414	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Yes — you ! If half I have heard and seen of you be true , He has been telling you more , and not less , of Himself than He does to most men . You , for aught I know , may know more of Him than Tregarva does . The gulf between you and him is this : he has obeyed what he knew — and you have not . ’
107423	107438	107415	107416	... Lancelot	172	‘ No!—do not cheat me ! You said once that you were a churchman . ’
107439	107453	106766	106766	his	172	‘ So I am . A Catholic of the Catholics . What then ? ’
107454	107569	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Who is He to whom you ask me to turn ? You talk to me of Him as my Father ; but you talk of Him to men of your own creed as The Father . You have mysterious dogmas of a Three in One . I know them ... I have admired them . In all their forms — in the Vedas , in the Neo - Platonists , in Jacob Boëhmen , in your Catholic creeds , in Coleridge , and the Germans from whom he borrowed , I have looked at them , and found in them beautiful phantasms of philosophy , ... all but scientific necessities ; ... but — ’
107570	107574	106766	106766	his	172	‘ But what ? ’
107575	107619	106766	106766	his	172	‘ I do not want cold abstract necessities of logic : I want living practical facts . If those mysterious dogmas speak of real and necessary properties of His being , they must be necessarily interwoven in practice with His revelation of Himself ? ’
107620	107633	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Most true . But how would you have Him unveil Himself ? ’
107634	107639	106766	106766	his	172	‘ By unveiling Himself . ’
107640	107683	106766	106766	his	172	‘ What ? To your simple intuition ? That was Semele ’s ambition ... You recollect the end of that myth . You recollect , too , as you have read the Neo - Platonists , the result of their similar attempt . ’
107684	107689	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Idolatry and magic . ’
107690	107722	106766	106766	his	172	‘ True ; and yet , such is the ambition of man , you who were just now envying Tregarva , are already longing to climb even higher than Saint Theresa . ’
107723	107759	106766	106766	his	172	‘ I do not often indulge in such an ambition . But I have read in your Schoolmen tales of a Beatific Vision ; how that the highest good for man was to see God . ’
107760	107767	106766	106766	his	172	‘ And did you believe that ? ’
107768	107781	106766	106766	his	172	‘ One can not believe the impossible — only regret its impossibility . ’
107782	107859	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Impossibility ? You can only see the Uncreate in the Create — the Infinite in the Finite — the absolute good in that which is like the good . Does Tregarva pretend to more ? He sees God in His own thoughts and consciousnesses , and in the events of the world around him , imaged in the mirror of his own mind . Is your mirror , then , so much narrower than his ? ’
107860	107890	106766	106766	his	172	‘ I have none . I see but myself , and the world , and far above them , a dim awful Unity , which is but a notion . ’
107891	107941	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Fool!—and slow of heart to believe ! Where else would you see Him but in yourself and in the world ? They are all things cognisable to you . Where else , but everywhere , would you see Him whom no man hath seen , or can see ? ’
107942	107961	106766	106766	his	172	‘ When He shows Himself to me in them , then I may see Him . But now — ’
107962	107996	106766	106766	his	172	‘ You have seen Him ; and because you do not know the name of what you see — or rather will not acknowledge it — you fancy that it is not there . ’
107997	108008	106766	106766	his	172	‘ How in His name ? What have I seen ? ’
108009	108072	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Ask yourself . Have you not seen , in your fancy , at least , an ideal of man , for which you spurned ( for Mellot has told me all ) the merely negative angelic — the merely receptive and indulgent feminine - ideals of humanity , and longed to be a man , like that ideal and perfect man ? ’
108073	108077	106766	106766	his	172	‘ I have . ’
108078	108187	106766	106766	his	172	‘ And what was your misery all along ? Was it not that you felt you ought to be a person with a one inner unity , a one practical will , purpose , and business given to you — not invented by yourself — in the great order and harmony of the universe,—and that you were not one?—That your self - willed fancies , and self - pleasing passions , had torn you in pieces , and left you inconsistent , dismembered , helpless , purposeless ? That , in short , you were below your ideal , just in proportion as you were not a person ? ’
108188	108195	106766	106766	his	172	‘ God knows you speak truth ! ’
108196	108328	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Then must not that ideal of humanity be a person himself?—Else how can he be the ideal man ? Where is your logic ? An impersonal ideal of a personal species ! ... And what is the most special peculiarity of man ? Is it not that he alone of creation is a son , with a Father to love and to obey ? Then must not the ideal man be a son also ? And last , but not least , is it not the very property of man that he is a spirit invested with flesh and blood ? Then must not the ideal man have , once at least , taken on himself flesh and blood also ? Else , how could he fulfil his own idea ? ’
108329	108457	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Yes ... Yes ... That thought , too , has glanced through my mind at moments , like a lightning - flash ; till I have envied the old Greeks their faith in a human Zeus , son of Kronos — a human Phoibos , son of Zeus . But I could not rest in them . They are noble . But are they — are any — perfect ideals ? The one thing I did , and do , and will believe , is the one which they do not fulfil — that man is meant to be the conqueror of the earth , matter , nature , decay , death itself , and to conquer them , as Bacon says , by obeying them . ’
108458	108631	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Hold it fast;—but follow it out , and say boldly , the ideal of humanity must be one who has conquered nature — one who rules the universe — one who has vanquished death itself ; and conquered them , as Bacon says , not by violating , but by submitting to them . Have you never heard of one who is said to have done this ? How do you know that in this ideal which you have seen , you have not seen the Son — the perfect Man , who died and rose again , and sits for ever Healer , and Lord , and Ruler of the universe ? ... Stay — do not answer me . Have you not , besides , had dreams of an all - Father — from whom , in some mysterious way , all things and beings must derive their source , and that Son — if my theory be true — among the rest , and above all the rest ? ’
108632	108654	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Who has not ? But what more dim or distant — more drearily , hopelessly notional , than that thought ? ’
108655	108746	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Only the thought that there is none . But the dreariness was only in your own inconsistency . If He be the Father of all , He must be the Father of persons — He Himself therefore a Person . He must be the Father of all in whom dwell personal qualities , power , wisdom , creative energy , love , justice , pity . Can He be their Father , unless all these very qualities are infinitely His ? Does He now look so terrible to you ? ’
108747	108765	106766	106766	his	172	‘ I have had this dream , too ; but I turned away from it in dread . ’
108766	108861	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Doubtless you did . Some day you will know why . Does that former dream of a human Son relieve this dream of none of its awfulness ? May not the type be beloved for the sake of its Antitype , even if the very name of All - Father is no guarantee for His paternal pity ! ... But you have had this dream . How know you , that in it you were not allowed a glimpse , however dim and distant , of Him whom the Catholics call the Father ? ’
108862	108869	106766	106766	his	172	‘ It may be ; but — ’
108870	108967	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Stay again . Had you never the sense of a Spirit in you — a will , an energy , an inspiration , deeper than the region of consciousness and reflection , which , like the wind , blew where it listed , and you heard the sound of it ringing through your whole consciousness , and yet knew not whence it came , or whither it went , or why it drove you on to dare and suffer , to love and hate ; to be a fighter , a sportsman , an artist — ’
108968	108973	108975	108975	Lancelot	172	‘ And a drunkard ! ’
108979	109090	108975	108975	Lancelot	172	‘ And a drunkard . But did it never seem to you that this strange wayward spirit , if anything , was the very root and core of your own personality ? And had you never a craving for the help of some higher , mightier spirit , to guide and strengthen yours ; to regulate and civilise its savage and spasmodic self - will ; to teach you your rightful place in the great order of the universe around ; to fill you with a continuous purpose and with a continuous will to do it ? Have you never had a dream of an Inspirer?—a spirit of all spirits ? ’
109098	109305	108975	108975	Lancelot	172	‘ Talk of anything but that ! Little you know — and yet you seem to know everything — the agony of craving with which I have longed for guidance ; the rage and disgust which possessed me when I tried one pretended teacher after another , and found in myself depths which their spirits could not , or rather would not , touch . I have been irreverent to the false , from very longing to worship the true ; I have been a rebel to sham leaders , for very desire to be loyal to a real one ; I have envied my poor cousin his Jesuits ; I have envied my own pointers their slavery to my whip and whistle ; I have fled , as a last resource , to brandy and opium , for the inspiration which neither man nor demon would bestow ... Then I found ... you know my story ... And when I looked to her to guide and inspire me , behold ! I found myself , by the very laws of humanity , compelled to guide and inspire her;—blind , to lead the blind!—Thank God , for her sake , that she was taken from me ! ’
109306	109438	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Did you ever mistake these substitutes , even the noblest of them , for the reality ? Did not your very dissatisfaction with them show you that the true inspirer ought to be , if he were to satisfy your cravings , a person , truly — else how could he inspire and teach you , a person yourself!—but an utterly infinite , omniscient , eternal person ? How know you that in that dream He was not unveiling Himself to you — He , The Spirit , who is the Lord and Giver of Life ; The Spirit , who teaches men their duty and relation to those above , around , beneath them ; the Spirit of order , obedience , loyalty , brotherhood , mercy , condescension ? ’
109439	109514	106766	106766	his	172	‘ But I never could distinguish these dreams from each other ; the moment that I essayed to separate them , I seemed to break up the thought of an absolute one ground of all things , without which the universe would have seemed a piecemeal chaos ; and they receded to infinite distance , and became transparent , barren , notional shadows of my own brain , even as your words are now . ’
109515	109577	106766	106766	his	172	‘ How know you that you were meant to distinguish them ? How know you that that very impossibility was not the testimony of fact and experience to that old Catholic dogma , for the sake of which you just now shrank from my teaching ? I say that this is so . How do you know that it is not ? ’
109578	109592	106766	106766	his	172	‘ But how do I know that it is ? I want proof . ’
109593	109628	106766	106766	his	172	‘ And you are the man who was , five minutes ago , crying out for practical facts , and disdaining cold abstract necessities of logic ! Can you prove that your body exists ? ’
109629	109632	106766	106766	his	172	‘ No . ’
109633	109642	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Can you prove that your spirit exists ? ’
109643	109646	106766	106766	his	172	‘ No . ’
109647	109659	106766	106766	his	172	‘ And yet know that they both exist . And how ? ’
109660	109664	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Solvitur ambulando . ’
109665	109710	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Exactly . When you try to prove either of them without the other , you fail . You arrive , if at anything , at some barren polar notion . By action alone you prove the mesothetic fact which underlies and unites them . ’
109711	109715	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Quorsum hæc ? ’
109716	109866	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Hither . I am not going to demonstrate the indemonstrable — to give you intellectual notions which , after all , will be but reflexes of my own peculiar brain , and so add the green of my spectacles to the orange of yours , and make night hideous by fresh monsters . I may help you to think yourself into a theoretical Tritheism , or a theoretical Sabellianism ; I can not make you think yourself into practical and living Catholicism . As you of anthropology , so I say of theology,—Solvitur ambulando . Do n’t believe Catholic doctrine unless you like ; faith is free . But see if you can reclaim either society or yourself without it ; see if He will let you reclaim them . Take Catholic doctrine for granted ; act on it ; and see if you will not reclaim them ! ’
109867	109884	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Take for granted ? Am I to come , after all , to implicit faith ? ’
109885	109906	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Implicit fiddlesticks ! Did you ever read the Novum Organum ? Mellot told me that you were a geologist . ’
109907	109910	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Well ? ’
109911	109970	106766	106766	his	172	‘ You took for granted what you read in geological books , and went to the mine and the quarry afterwards , to verify it in practice ; and according as you found fact correspond to theory , you retained or rejected . Was that implicit faith , or common sense , common humility , and sound induction ? ’
109971	109978	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Sound induction , at least . ’
109979	110074	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Then go now , and do likewise . Believe that the learned , wise , and good , for 1800 years , may possibly have found out somewhat , or have been taught somewhat , on this matter , and test their theory by practice . If a theory on such a point is worth anything at all , it is omnipotent and all - explaining . If it will not work , of course there is no use keeping it a moment . Perhaps it will work . I say it will . ’
110075	110115	106766	106766	his	172	‘ But I shall not work it ; I still dread my own spectacles . I dare not trust myself alone to verify a theory of Murchison ’s or Lyell ’s . How dare I trust myself in this ? ’
110116	110196	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Then do not trust yourself alone : come and see what others are doing . Come , and become a member of a body which is verifying , by united action , those universal and eternal truths , which are too great for the grasp of any one time - ridden individual . Not that we claim the gift of infallibility , any more than I do that of perfect utterance of the little which we do know . ’
110197	110212	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Then what do you promise me in asking me to go with you ? ’
110213	110303	106766	106766	his	172	‘ Practical proof that these my words are true,—practical proof that they can make a nation all that England might be and is not,—the sight of what a people might become who , knowing thus far , do what they know .

110704	110832	110701	110702	THE MAN	738	’ He took Lancelot by the hand . A peaceful warmth diffused itself over his limbs ; the droning of the organ sounded fainter and more faint ; the marble monuments grew dim and distant ; and , half unconsciously , he followed like a child through the cathedral door . I can foresee many criticisms , and those not unreasonable ones , on this little book — let it be some excuse at least for me , that I have foreseen them . Readers will complain , I doubt not , of the very mythical and mysterious dénouement of a story which began by things so gross and palpable as field - sports and pauperism . But is it not true that , sooner or later , ‘
110837	111121	110701	110702	THE MAN	738	’ ? Out of mystery we all came at our birth , fox - hunters and paupers , sages and saints ; into mystery we shall all return ... at all events , when we die ; probably , as it seems to me , some of us will return thither before we die . For if the signs of the times mean anything , they portend , I humbly submit , a somewhat mysterious and mythical dénouement to this very age , and to those struggles of it which I have herein attempted , clumsily enough , to sketch . We are entering fast , I both hope and fear , into the region of prodigy , true and false ; and our great - grandchildren will look back on the latter half of this century , and ask , if it were possible that such things could happen in an organised planet ? The Benthamites will receive this announcement , if it ever meets their eyes , with shouts of laughter . Be it so ... nous verrons ... In the year 1847 , if they will recollect , they were congratulating themselves on the nations having grown too wise to go to war any more ... and in 1848 ? So it has been from the beginning . What did philosophers expect in 1792 ? What did they see in 1793 ? Popery was to be eternal : but the Reformation came nevertheless . Rome was to be eternal : but Alaric came . Jerusalem was to be eternal : but Titus came . Gomorrha was to be eternal , I doubt not ; but the fire - floods came ... ‘
111167	111181	110701	110702	THE MAN	738	’ Of course they did not expect it . They went on saying , ‘
111201	112017	112144	112144	I	0	’ Most true ; but what if they were from the beginning — over a volcano ’s mouth ? What if the method whereon things have proceeded since the creation were , as geology as well as history proclaims , a cataclysmic method ? What then ? Why should not this age , as all others like it have done , end in a cataclysm , and a prodigy , and a mystery ? And why should not my little book do likewise ? Again — Readers will probably complain of the fragmentary and unconnected form of the book . Let them first be sure that that is not an integral feature of the subject itself , and therefore the very form the book should take . Do not young men think , speak , act , just now , in this very incoherent , fragmentary way ; without methodic education or habits of thought ; with the various stereotyped systems which they have received by tradition , breaking up under them like ice in a thaw ; with a thousand facts and notions , which they know not how to classify , pouring in on them like a flood?—a very Yeasty state of mind altogether , like a mountain burn in a spring rain , carrying down with it stones , sticks , peat - water , addle grouse - eggs and drowned kingfishers , fertilising salts and vegetable poisons — not , alas ! without a large crust , here and there , of sheer froth . Yet no heterogeneous confused flood - deposit , no fertile meadows below . And no high water , no fishing . It is in the long black droughts , when the water is foul from lowness , and not from height , that Hydras and Desmidiæ , and Rotifers , and all uncouth pseud - organisms , bred of putridity , begin to multiply , and the fish are sick for want of a fresh , and the cunningest artificial fly is of no avail , and the shrewdest angler will do nothing — except with a gross fleshly gilt - tailed worm , or the cannibal bait of roe , whereby parent fishes , like competitive barbarisms , devour each other ’s flesh and blood — perhaps their own . It is when the stream is clearing after a flood , that the fish will rise ... When will the flood clear , and the fish come on the feed again ? Next ; I shall be blamed for having left untold the fate of those characters who have acted throughout as Lancelot ’s satellites . But indeed their only purpose consisted in their influence on his development , and that of Tregarva ; I do not see that we have any need to follow them farther . The reader can surely conjecture their history for himself ... He may be pretty certain that they have gone the way of the world ... abierunt ad plures ... for this life or for the next . They have done — very much what he or I might have done in their place — nothing . Nature brings very few of her children to perfection , in these days or any other ... And for Grace , which does bring its children to perfection , the quantity and quality of the perfection must depend on the quantity and quality of the grace , and that again , to an awful extent — The Giver only knows to how great an extent — on the will of the recipients , and therefore in exact proportion to their lowness in the human scale , on the circumstances which environ them . So my characters are now — very much what the reader might expect them to be . I confess them to be unsatisfactory ; so are most things : but how can I solve problems which fact has not yet solved for me ? How am I to extricate my antitypal characters , when their living types have not yet extricated themselves ? When the age moves on , my story shall move on with it . Let it be enough , that my puppets have retreated in good order , and that I am willing to give to those readers who have conceived something of human interest for them , the latest accounts of their doings . With the exception , that is , of Mellot and Sabina . Them I confess to be an utterly mysterious , fragmentary little couple . Why not ? Do you not meet with twenty such in the course of your life?—Charming people , who for aught you know may be opera folk from Paris , or emissaries from the Czar , or disguised Jesuits , or disguised Angels ... who evidently ‘
112022	112143	112144	112144	I	0	’ and a strange one , which you never expect or attempt to fathom ; who interest you intensely for a while , and then are whirled away again in the great world - waltz , and lost in the crowd for ever ? Why should you wish my story to be more complete than theirs is , or less romantic than theirs may be ? There are more things in London , as well as in heaven and earth , than are dreamt of in our philosophy . If you but knew the secret history of that dull gentleman opposite whom you sat at dinner yesterday!—the real thoughts of that chattering girl whom you took down!—‘Omnia exeunt in mysterium , ’

112461	112514	112408	112410	the Baptist preacher	3043	’ Waiving the good taste , which was probably on a par in both cases , the reader is left to decide which of the two texts was most applicable . Mrs. Lavington is Mrs. Lavington no longer . She has married , to the astonishment of the world in general , that ‘
112518	112719	112720	112722	an excellent man	3045	’ Mr. O’Blareaway , who has been discovered not to be quite as young as he appeared , his graces being principally owing to a Brutus wig , which he has now wisely discarded . Mrs. Lavington now sits in state under her husband ’s ministry , as the leader of the religious world in the fashionable watering - place of Steamingbath , and derives her notions of the past , present , and future state of the universe principally from those two meek and unbiased periodicals , the Protestant Hue - and - Cry and the Christian Satirist , to both of which O’Blareaway is a constant contributor . She has taken such an aversion to Whitford since Argemone ’s death , that she has ceased to have any connection with that unhealthy locality , beyond the popular and easy one of rent - receiving . O’Blareaway has never entered the parish to his knowledge since Mr. Lavington ’s funeral ; and was much pleased , the last time I rode with him , at my informing him that a certain picturesque moorland which he had been greatly admiring , was his own possession ... After all , he is ‘
112724	112801	112720	112722	an excellent man	3045	’ and when I met a large party at his house the other day , and beheld dory and surmullet , champagne and lachryma Christi , amid all the glory of the Whitford plate ... ( some of it said to have belonged to the altar of the Priory Church four hundred years ago ) , I was deeply moved by the impressive tone in which , at the end of a long grace , he prayed ‘
112818	112934	112935	112935	I	0	’ ... My dear readers , would you have me , even if I could , extricate him from such an Elysium by any denouement whatsoever ? Poor dear Luke , again , is said to be painting lean frescoes for the Something - or - other - Kirche at Munich ; and the vicar , under the name of Father Stylites , of the order of St. Philumena , is preaching impassioned sermons to crowded congregations at St. George ’s , Bedlam . How can I extricate them from that ? No one has come forth of it yet , to my knowledge , except by paths whereof I shall use Lessing ’s saying , ‘
112956	113005	113008	113008	we	3048	’ But who cares for their coming out ? They are but two more added to the five hundred , at whose moral suicide , and dive into the Roman Avernus , a quasi - Protestant public looks on with a sort of savage satisfaction , crying only , ‘
113202	113394	113200	113201	Dr. Watts	426	’ well - known moral song concerning the sluggard and his garden . Lord Minchampstead again prospers . Either the nuns of Minchampstead have left no Nemesis behind them , like those of Whitford , or a certain wisdom and righteousness of his , however dim and imperfect , averts it for a time . So , as I said , he prospers , and is hated ; especially by his farmers , to whom he has just offered long leases , and a sliding corn - rent . They would have hated him just the same if he had kept them at rack - rents ; and he has not forgotten that ; but they have . They looked shy at the leases , because they bind them to farm high , which they do not know how to do ; and at the corn - rent , because they think that he expects wheat to rise again — which , being a sensible man , he very probably does . But for my story — I certainly do not see how to extricate him or any one else from farmers ’
113410	113486	113200	113201	Dr. Watts	426	’ more free - trade to settle it , before I can say anything thereon . Still less can I foreshadow the fate of his eldest son , who has just been rusticated from Christ Church for riding one of Simmon ’s hacks through a china - shop window ; especially as the youth is reported to be given to piquette and strong liquors , and , like many noblemen ’s eldest sons , is considered ‘
113496	114138	113200	113201	Dr. Watts	426	’ As for the old lord himself , I have no wish to change or develop him in any way — except to cut slips off him , as you do off a willow , and plant two or three in every county in England . Let him alone to work out his own plot ... we have not seen the end of it yet ; but whatever it will be , England has need of him as a transition - stage between feudalism and * * * * ; for many a day to come . If he be not the ideal landlord , he is nearer it than any we are like yet to see ... Except one ; and that , after all , is Lord Vieuxbois . Let him go on , like a gallant gentleman as he is , and prosper . And he will prosper , for he fears God , and God is with him . He has much to learn ; and a little to unlearn . He has to learn that God is a living God now , as well as in the middle ages ; to learn to trust not in antique precedents , but in eternal laws : to learn that his tenants , just because they are children of God , are not to be kept children , but developed and educated into sons ; to learn that God ’s grace , like His love , is free , and that His spirit bloweth where it listeth , and vindicates its own free - will against our narrow systems , by revealing , at times , even to nominal Heretics and Infidels , truths which the Catholic Church must humbly receive , as the message of Him who is wider , deeper , more tolerant , than even she can be ... And he is in the way to learn all this . Let him go on . At what conclusions he will attain , he knows not , nor do I. But this I know , that he is on the path to great and true conclusions .... And he is just about to be married , too . That surely should teach him something . The papers inform me that his bride elect is Lord Minchampstead ’s youngest daughter . That should be a noble mixture ; there should be stalwart offspring , spiritual as well as physical , born of that intermarriage of the old and the new . We will hope it : perhaps some of my readers , who enter into my inner meaning , may also pray for it . Whom have I to account for besides ? Crawy — though some of my readers may consider the mention of him superfluous . But to those who do not , I may impart the news , that last month , in the union workhouse — he died ; and may , for aught we know , have ere this met Squire Lavington ... He is supposed , or at least said , to have had a soul to be saved ... as I think , a body to be saved also . But what is one more among so many ? And in an over - peopled country like this , too ... One must learn to look at things — and paupers — in the mass . The poor of Whitford also ? My dear readers , I trust you will not ask me just now to draw the horoscope of the Whitford poor , or of any others . Really that depends principally on yourselves ... But for the present , the poor of Whitford , owing , as it seems to them and me , to quite other causes than an ‘

114154	114183	113200	113201	Dr. Watts	426	’ are growing more profligate , reckless , pauperised , year by year . O’Blareaway complained sadly to me the other day that the poor - rates were becoming ‘
